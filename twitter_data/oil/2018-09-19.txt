Each and every one on tickets which cost $48.00 or less. We all burn the midnight oil and take great pride in the selections we make. #notsofast

11 2018-09-19 23:58:27 It literally doesn’t matter. If you’re small ppl talk crap abt how flat chested you are. You can’t win with people like that. which most of the time are boys with far too much time on their hands. They should go mow the lawn or learn to change their oil.

47 2018-09-19 23:55:59 That carbon taxes don't work when they are hijacked by politicians, outside interests should look in their own backyard before coming to Canada and perhaps you should learn to read. 35 years in the oil business world wide.

49 2018-09-19 23:55:57 Wasn’t that oil based? Bc extra lubed condoms come with silicone lube
50 2018-09-19 23:55:53 It’s more than sad. I watched a very bad round up. It’s your worst nitemare.  And there doing it to make land available to fracking, mining, oil, and ranchers. In other words money.
51 2018-09-19 23:55:41 Niggas grew up from Oil and Hennessey...
52 2018-09-19 23:55:38 ok so what we need to do, is get the cbd oil wax, and mold it to your form

that's step one
53 2018-09-19 23:55:34 the oil industry says the drop is due to winter gas which is cheaper.
54 2018-09-19 23:55:32 Use sea buckthorn oil daily mami, might help in many ways 
55 2018-09-19 23:55:19 What means are being utilized to develop oil in our own deserts...why so Middle East dependent? the UN_Creative alternative energy sources are a sign that a weak male is incharge or the idiot Hillary causing another  BP oil spill to prove her masculinity and ability to play
56 2018-09-19 23:55:09 I have a website for great treats and oil for dogs, and oil for you too! Just ask me!
57 2018-09-19 23:54:50 The problem with climate change is that it’s global, you can 100% guarantee that if the US suffered all the effects of US pollution we wouldn’t have half the country wanting to “bring back” Coal, Asbestos, Oil and all the other crap this administration is doing #climatechange
58 2018-09-19 23:54:39 Best team in Europe, all the papers were saying on Tuesday. Like they're a Roy of the Rovers outfit. They're the richest team in all of world sports. They're owned by a country. A mad, oil rich country. Plus, have major Chinese backing.

65 2018-09-19 23:52:33 CNN is not about news it’s propaganda
66 2018-09-19 23:52:29 I knew it was CBD oil, i was being a bit facetious i guess. I do plan on listening to the podcast where she talks about it, though!  I just hate how they used ‘Weed’ in the headline to get everyone worked up.
67 2018-09-19 23:52:21 Its a honda them bitches never die new timing belt fresh oil and if it leaks maybe some gaskets and she’ll run another 250k lmaoo
68 2018-09-19 23:52:06 “The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.”
69 2018-09-19 23:52:03 Snake oil shumer is corrupt. I cannot believe the bullshit that comes out of his mouth.
70 2018-09-19 23:52:03 They’re destroying the economy by trying to break our dependence on oil?
71 2018-09-19 23:51:48 Try CBD oil! A drop or two rubbed on the gums and baby and mom will be relieved. It makes you healthy, not high. Lots of false info out there. Message me if you want link to look/buy.
72 2018-09-19 23:51:47 Actually 100 years of oil HAS been confirmed. My d-i-l did the core testing. There's oil there for AT LEAST 100 years OR MORE & with new recovery procedures, its even easier to get. Yes Tommy dismissed it. Indy was NOT based on OIL. That was unionist nonsense. OIL WAS A BONUS.
73 2018-09-19 23:51:46 You’ve seen ‘Who Killed the Electric Car’ ??
Because it was bug oil and Bush Cheney that made the EV-1 disappear
74 2018-09-19 23:51:44 Aku cuma pake tea tree oil tbs aja, facial wash aja belum pake karna takut kering lagi :(
75 2018-09-19 23:51:37 sexy oil rig.
76 2018-09-19 23:51:31 Wanna know something that correlates? Oil imported to the US from Norway and deaths in vehicle/train collisions. Correlation, say it with me, does not imply causation.
77 2018-09-19 23:51:12 I was out in Minot 5-6 years ago doing engineering work for Hess.  It was the year Mouse river flooded, during the oil boom.  Crazy state.
78 2018-09-19 23:51:06 just accidentally got fly to get my oil changed and guess what there are no hot guys here and i didn’t meet the love of my life, maybe tomorrow tho

If you're leaving a fucking parking lot in the rain don't go SPEEDING out like you have the right!
83 2018-09-19 23:50:14 I need a body suit made of cbd oil
84 2018-09-19 23:49:57 I’ve been doing some k-beauty regiment. Using an oil based cleanser from lush along and then a cleansing wash and a aha/bha cosrx toner. I had a bad breakout recently I believe from the sunscreen I was using so I just stopped using everything to kind of reset.
85 2018-09-19 23:49:56 If oil and water don’t mix...being messy and anointed won’t either.
86 2018-09-19 23:49:48 Assuming that's an actual oil painting it's better than anything I could make under those circumstances...
87 2018-09-19 23:49:48 I watched the fire of God and the oil of His presence begin to fall. The fire of God was falling and consuming all things that were not of Him, and the oil of His presence was bringing significant healing.   I watched as cells were being restored and reignited with life.
88 2018-09-19 23:49:20 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
89 2018-09-19 23:49:06 I’ve been in the oil & gas / pipeline bizz for close to 30 years. All facets of it. No confusion here.
90 2018-09-19 23:49:05 its putting out more like, grease/oil than it is color so it just makes the paper disgusting, rip
91 2018-09-19 23:49:04 Not to good honestly. Sorry for being that guy. My pay check wasnt as big as I thought it would be which wasnt a problem at first but then my car broke down & I need to see if a gasket blew because there is oil all over my alternator & I think thats why it wont start
92 2018-09-19 23:48:49 CNN: “Donald Trump sexually harasses young boy in public.”
93 2018-09-19 23:48:39 Or oil company
94 2018-09-19 23:48:29 Imagine having so much money, you can get the oil changed on your car at least once a week
95 2018-09-19 23:48:20 Isn't that cos everyone needs Yankee dollars to buy oil? Note Chavez, Hussein, etc, going on the bad guy list once they experimented with selling it in Euros (and Chirac with buying it in Euros).
96 2018-09-19 23:47:58 I am 99% sure my mom doesn’t want to be healthy. I was making some grilled chicken here she comes seasoning and adding lots of oil 
97 2018-09-19 23:47:53 Every time I see your promoted campaign fund raising tweet I will donate $10 to @tedcruz 
Ted is up by $50 just today.
98 2018-09-19 23:47:44 I drove to 2 GNC’s today for vitamin e oil that I put on my tummy and both of them were sold out. It’s like god wants me to get stretch marks
99 2018-09-19 23:47:35 Yes. Palm oil bullshit.
100 2018-09-19 23:47:33 My body hates bio oil lol.
101 2018-09-19 23:47:32 Pure castor oil is a must have, if you don’t then you’re doing something wrong
102 2018-09-19 23:47:32 I’m curious. How many vegans still consume palm oil?
103 2018-09-19 23:47:24 the giant number of rich Texans in the oil industry?
104 2018-09-19 23:47:24 Use aloe Vera oil it grows my hair like crazy
105 2018-09-19 23:47:19 Ju$t mean$ more cheajp oil for China... they won't let $hithole ameriKKKa push them around...
106 2018-09-19 23:47:14 actual greenwashing of emissions. useful in phase where oil is dying, but it encourages further harvesting of biofuel and therefore increasing our absolute and relative emission levels. if this makes you stop drilling, go for it. after passing by out-of-house climate scientists
107 2018-09-19 23:47:10 Just like a star across my sky,
Just like an angel off the page,
You have appeared to my life,
Feel like I'll never be the same,
Just like a song in my heart,
Just like oil on my hands,
Honour to love you
108 2018-09-19 23:46:51 love to be marco rubio and bitch about a struggling country’s head of state eating a steak, while also supporting economic warfare that is a major contributor to the crisis in that state and also wish for that country to be run by fruit and oil companies and feudal landlords!!!
109 2018-09-19 23:46:51 Unconventional, but CBD oil works great too, just a couple drops on the gums and it works wonders. I can provide a link if you are interested. Safe for all ages.
110 2018-09-19 23:46:50 Thats a pretty big oversimplification of the issues. Should we remove the right to vote from subsidized farmers? Subsidized oil companies? Disabled people? People who work and also receive public assistance? Students?
111 2018-09-19 23:46:39 Ever since I started using coconut oil as makeup remover, my lashes have been looking amazing 
112 2018-09-19 23:46:22 I clearly have no clue how BMI works, but happy BMI day to anyone else who got their never constant in amount or timing royalty checks today. May your van enjoy her probably overdue oil change.
113 2018-09-19 23:46:13 I can't even take the oil because of my liver. Taking it could keep me off the transplant list, if I need to be put on it
114 2018-09-19 23:46:01 @DavidDurgadas A little greenhouse effect is a good thing a lot of greenhouse effect is the planet Venus, the unrestrained pursuit of profits by the oil and coal industry may hasten the destruction of our planet earth. we must speed up the transition to renewable energy, peace!
115 2018-09-19 23:46:01 Maybe I’m the unlucky one but somehow I always am the one which makes me think there are tons of defects these days in all sorts of stuff we buy. If you have my model Honda it will shut off on low oil anyways so dont worry too much until you see a problem.

多分聞きたかったのは最初の1行だけですwwwwww
119 2018-09-19 23:45:42 I hope your medication works for you! Be sure to report anything that feels off or not enough for your symptom management. And flares suck!  Im often in pain too. Outside of my infusion, I have found that CBD oil helps me too. 
120 2018-09-19 23:45:33 Never said I had proof of what’s happening, I just find it disgusting that the @albertateachers has anything to do with a person bent on destroying the Alberta economy while she is ok with despots from SA & Venezuela sending us their oil. #Oilpaysteacherswages @CanadaAction
121 2018-09-19 23:45:30 Although @JerryBrownGov is a strong proponent of #fracking, he speaks of 'environmental' issues. When oil tankers were parked offshore in Sunset Beach,  gasoline was $4.00 a gallon. Look it up. #DeepStateCorruption
122 2018-09-19 23:45:11 RT @LS_Nutrition: #Safflower Oil this September? It can interact with #Anticoagulant, #Antiplatelet and other drugs. Check with your #MD!
123 2018-09-19 23:44:49 I was having a crazy chocolate craving in the middle of class, so naturally I asked around my table and one kid was like
Yeah dude! 
*hands it to me*
Oh, but it’s got lots of CBD oil in it... that cool? 
Liberal arts kids are wild
124 2018-09-19 23:44:49 So now China is dumping our bonds causing rates to spike?This is a nightmare for your supporters in the mortgage industry and trying to buy a home. Higher rates, higher oil for winter, higher gas prices, and lower income.  Not good, please fix.
125 2018-09-19 23:44:43 Because one of them is for thin oil and my cartridge wasn’t pulling so I had to buy another one 
126 2018-09-19 23:44:33 If zoodles are zucchini noodles, I usually cook them quickly in a pan with a bit of oil, butter/ghee, and salt.
127 2018-09-19 23:44:32 Wait till the activists shut down the transport of Ontario vehicles to the USA because these vehicles pollute. Is this theory really any different than blocking oil shipments to borders or shores?
128 2018-09-19 23:44:24 Guess so, and in case you are confused Calgary is not in the patch. Those are office jobs that the greedy oil companies outsourced over seas. Lots of action out in the field where the real work is done. At least whatever work they haven't automated to rip us off further.
129 2018-09-19 23:44:23 Man i loveeee broccoli  i coat it in Lil bit oil & use pink salt & lemon pepper and broil that shit mmmm slappin loll
130 2018-09-19 23:44:18 UNM scheduling a road NAIA opponent on Dec. 30 (a Sunday) that requires a 5 1/2 hour bus ride home just a couple days before the Mountain West opener on the road interesting. Better be a deep pocket book from those Hobbs oil boosters to make it worth it.
131 2018-09-19 23:44:00 My family was poor but we weren’t. When I went to their house they was eating rice a soy sauce and salad oil or rice w ketchup only. Mf’s had nothing to eat. So that’s how I be thinking about Mf’s eating rice w sugar like who comes up w this shit. That’s poor culture.
132 2018-09-19 23:43:55 Indeed, but you're no typical case, you're a force to be reckoned with! Alas many patients (or their families) are at a vulnerable point and I've seen people exploited & damaged by snake oil salesmen enough that I'm just mindful not to let that sort abuse people is all.
133 2018-09-19 23:43:49 I want a lower income tax. I want a REAL push for renewable energy alongside sustaining Alberta Oil. I want development in the east. Is that your party?
134 2018-09-19 23:43:44 Oh come on. I'm a specialist in freaking Anglo-Saxon poetry and even I know that the juniors here were affected primarily by global events and the tanking of world oil prices. Do you read?
135 2018-09-19 23:43:42 In specific parts of coastal Odisha, where I live, mustard oil was used for everyday cooking n also as body oil. 
Urad used as dal and 'chakuli pitha', ie Odia pancake.Last 3decades lots changed.
136 2018-09-19 23:43:39 @Jerrybrown: why is Los Angeles the only city I have ever visited that has oil wells operating right smack i the center of the metropolis? Hypocrite is too mild here. Self serving. lying, ass hole.
137 2018-09-19 23:43:23 > associate traumatic botched surgery with smell of cloves 

> have to use clove oil for something 

> get smell stuck on your hands and in your nose 

> die
138 2018-09-19 23:43:21 You can easily make homemade tahini! Just buy sesame seeds in bulk and blend them up, and drizzle in some sesame seed oil if they get stuck.
139 2018-09-19 23:43:18 coconut oil by @lizzo came on spotify while I was measuring out coconut oil to make cookies. Coincidence? I think not
140 2018-09-19 23:43:18 I went to @Walmart for a simple oil change this past weekend & they ruined my car, check engine light came on, car air intake was taking in too much air causing me to lose control nearly wrecking my vehicle fuck @Walmart
141 2018-09-19 23:43:11 When will fossil fuels run out?
Oil   - 2050.
Gas  - 2060.
Coal - 2090

142 2018-09-19 23:43:08 Sorry for your family term oil hope things are going to get better before they get worse 
143 2018-09-19 23:42:47 Used tiny amount of bleach to clean the bathroom, with tea tree oil. Smells like a Clorox explosion. Ick.
144 2018-09-19 23:42:27 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
145 2018-09-19 23:42:10 Then we will need oil cans and WD-40 and Rustoleum 
146 2018-09-19 23:42:00 Put a little bit of lavender oil in your lotion and put it on your hands!! It’s help me tremendously when I feel like that
147 2018-09-19 23:41:59 Glad to hear that.... I’d recommend try using baby oil on a cotton to clean your mascara, it’s so much easier~

149 2018-09-19 23:41:53 we tunisians need trade with USA we have olive oil and zboub
150 2018-09-19 23:41:49 unfortunately oil and gas will fight every step of the way, as they have for at least 50 years...Zero emissions cars are a huge factor to mitigate AGW. We have to get under the emissions levels that earth's sinks (oceans, forests, rock weathering) can absorb annually - first step
151 2018-09-19 23:41:27 Olbas oil ku terkenal di tegal angus guysssss everyone iz lookin for it
152 2018-09-19 23:41:22 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
153 2018-09-19 23:41:21 Which one of the facts are you disputing? 

But yes if you want to work in the oil industry I would advise against it. They are not our friends and even though production is through the roof they are not hiring. Because they have automated and outsourced the jobs.
154 2018-09-19 23:41:08 Wait, CBD oil makes you a bad mom now?  CBD doesn’t even get you high. Edu-ma-cation is so important.
155 2018-09-19 23:40:55 SAMESIES - I do olive oil, onion and bacon and seasoning and get them a good char going.
156 2018-09-19 23:40:33 Now if only we could start some kind of price justification model for these greedy oil companies we should be all set. I firmly believe that gas companies should have to file a report with the government justifying why they are increasing the price. This will stop #GreedAtThePump
157 2018-09-19 23:40:32 No, Rhona, that tail lamp used an oil burner not candle, or any other method  #finditfixitflogit
158 2018-09-19 23:40:28 Love our @POTUS the best. God bless The Emperor Trump
159 2018-09-19 23:40:28 How in the hell is an amateur, as a patient & not a doctor, supposed to make sense of any of this?  Fish oil out, now aspirin, the miracle drug, is wavering towards the door. My heart will beat, aspirin, no aspirin, until it stops.
160 2018-09-19 23:40:17 Been riding for the longest knowing that I need an oil change ..

175 2018-09-19 23:37:55 okay that extra virgin olive oil commercial with the weird mom and her grown ass man child was creepy as fuck even before i realized the "extra virgin" was part of the joke
176 2018-09-19 23:37:49 Get the damn oil into the pipes. Oh wait, build the pipes! This safety upgrade a smokescreen to deceive. The safest of all is those pipes. Speaking in circles, astronaut. So stop  fake virtues.

178 2018-09-19 23:37:38 The correlation coefficient between coca cultivation and the usdcop exchange rate is not significant.  However, if you were to look at the oil price coefficient with the cop, you may learn something significant.
179 2018-09-19 23:37:27 I just remembered this kitchen safety video we had to watch in school catering where a woman carrying boiling oil slips and it pours all over her. Good night
180 2018-09-19 23:36:57 I’m not an oil expert by any means, but maybe peppermint?

189 2018-09-19 23:34:50 If the oil from condoms are gathered in one place, can it fry one plantain?
190 2018-09-19 23:34:47 So back in the 80's Big Oil knew that rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere would do nothing in particular to weather (which is what we've observed)? Wow those bastards. Maybe they shouldn't have enhanced our lives with those fossil fuels.
191 2018-09-19 23:34:43 The interest rates are unrealistically high, often countries repay debt in assets such as cobalt or oil.
192 2018-09-19 23:34:20 I think oil drums have to be one of my favorite sounds
193 2018-09-19 23:34:14 Clubs owned by arabs with oil money aren’t good in the CL.
194 2018-09-19 23:34:04 Truck will go for $20,000 on a lot in 3 years. After the lessee changed the oil maybe
twice and the injector pump is headed south. A real classic. After boasting how badass his/her truck was.
195 2018-09-19 23:34:03 At the moment I like to use ground oats w/ a dash of cinnamon mixed in oil, honey or water :)
196 2018-09-19 23:33:54 You have no idea what everyone is going through. The fish/oil/waste odor is inescapable. And, the high temperatures exasperates the misery. 
But thanks for noticing how it can advance your organization’s agenda.
197 2018-09-19 23:33:47 Took my car into get the wheel rotated, replace the wheel lock bolt, oil change and to replace the Exel. Hopefully have it done by tomorrow.

201 2018-09-19 23:32:58 FUN HORRIFYING STORY FOR YOU: Growing up my older sister got banned from the kitchen by my mum and me after she did these three things: set two small fires, one being an oil fire and she threw it in water after I screamed "DOn'T", and after she used soap on our cast iron
202 2018-09-19 23:32:53 Engine oil and groundut oil na the same thing. All na oil.

209 2018-09-19 23:32:14 people look at Picasso and say “this is old” that is true but, picasso is still considered the granddaddy of oil painted art. Consider history before making a judgement.
210 2018-09-19 23:32:11 Actually, I am wise enough to know how this works, and actually you could have. Just like @SierraClub @LCVoters @NRDC all endorsed an Anschutz Oil & Gas M&A man @SenBennetCO who voted for the Keystone-XL Pipeline.  And I am wise enough to recognize when a statement is not direct.
211 2018-09-19 23:31:27 @kaitapop A little greenhouse effect is a good thing a lot of greenhouse effect is the planet Venus, the unrestrained pursuit of profits by the oil and coal industry may hasten the destruction of our planet earth. we must speed up the transition to renewable energy soon
212 2018-09-19 23:31:01 Thank you and I am so sorry about the neuropathy.  Have you tried Borage Oil?  A doctor I know prescribed it to his neuropathy patients.

226 2018-09-19 23:29:26 I already take the CBD oil. Works for inflammation. But its pricey. Coke needs 2 get a snack division 2go with their drinks. There R so many new snacks out there that R better 4U than chips & cheetos. If I was CEO i'd be buying them up right and left B4 Pepsi does.

240 2018-09-19 23:26:34 He's an opportunistic snake oil salesman. When a country or economy faces turmoil, these parasites often pop up out of nowhere. History repeats itself over and over.
241 2018-09-19 23:26:29 This!!! I started using coconut oil, baking soda, and  tea tree oil and my skin has been the best it’s ever been
242 2018-09-19 23:26:20 Why would you suggest that to people who don’t want it ? North Sea oil will have long ran out before that happens !
243 2018-09-19 23:26:17 Just MOST scientists. Like 4 in 5 doctors. But hey, OIL!
244 2018-09-19 23:26:16 Job interviewer: do your remember tweeting “I’m such a slut for tea tree oil” on September 19, 2018
Me: lol yeah, shit’s lit
245 2018-09-19 23:26:07 Yeah that's true. Certainly oil should be used in circumstances where it's necessary. I'm just have a big distaste for those running the oil industry.
246 2018-09-19 23:25:53 Flip this mullah, er....

Seems they're speculating on all but oil and gold.

248 2018-09-19 23:25:43 Casual reminder to keep your cats away from menthol and peppermint oil.
Catnip is to peppermint is to menthol as opium is to morphine is to heroin.

Be cautious.
249 2018-09-19 23:25:21 Before any sanctions negotiations with murdering Putin he must withdrew from 2 sections of Georgia and Crimea in Ukraine Invasion is not Invitation Trump must gut the Russian economy with cheap Liquid Natural Gas & Oil to Europe

256 2018-09-19 23:23:40 You can conserve water by only using oil to cook food : fried, deep fried rather then boiled, steamed, blanched

260 2018-09-19 23:23:15 See Venezuela as a cautionary tale regarding putting all your eggs in the oil basic, sweetie.

Explain how a bunch of export pipelines designed to make the oil industry few more cents on the barrel stops imports and and increases royalties? 

Won't that drove down oil prices?
261 2018-09-19 23:23:10 Hahahahaha what a gas bag!!!!!! Nothing but idiotic blabbering from a washed up has been. We all know he is a paid troll and that ALL Old Auto & Big Oil are now failing just like Kodak, Block buster video, Nokia, IBM, GE, ATT ( Pac Bell bought them to save them & uses name) etc!
262 2018-09-19 23:23:02 I’d really love a eucalyptus oil roller rn 
263 2018-09-19 23:22:45 Now that I’m back to using CBD oil, hopefully all these symptoms will lessen.
264 2018-09-19 23:22:44 If you’re right they are done, because Houston is swarming with the things - in an oil town!
265 2018-09-19 23:22:43 Exxon oil, they want to drill the arctic and they want us to keep using oil forever

271 2018-09-19 23:21:36 Soy is primarily crushed for soy oil and soybean meal. Soybean meal is a high protein animal feed.

273 2018-09-19 23:21:11 QOTD: Oil has been fine in the earth’s crust for millions of years and now I need to change it every 6 months? You guys are OBVIOUSLY just trying to steal money from me.
274 2018-09-19 23:21:08 Lol...Na engine oil?
275 2018-09-19 23:20:56 not really, unless you’re picky. does it have freezer burn? I learned that if you rub oil into burns when its defrosted it kinda helps remoisturize it

280 2018-09-19 23:20:03 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
281 2018-09-19 23:19:54 And thank you for killing all the wildlife while you were at it! Also, palm oil is so unhealthy! Stop deceiving people! You are killing them! (Again)
282 2018-09-19 23:19:42 Sometimes that is a good thing. How is Maggie doing? Did the CBD oil help her at all? Maybe you should try some yourself but make sure it has THC in it!!!   
283 2018-09-19 23:19:26 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
284 2018-09-19 23:19:25 Watch next 4-6 weeks how the oil prices move. Sensex may touch 32000 if oil prices remain high and if they move above $80.With elections in key states expect populist policy measures being announced. Rupee to be under pressure
285 2018-09-19 23:18:45 Look can we just agree the entire alt-right is a collaboration of hardcore racists, opportunistic snake oil salesmen and of course rubes to power their economy.
286 2018-09-19 23:18:43 I hope every big oil industry executive goes bankrupt tbh.

296 2018-09-19 23:17:27 Went to jiffy lube today and got one of those Pumpkin Spice Oil Changes everyone is raving about. #tistheseason
297 2018-09-19 23:17:20 Oil added £1bn in the last GERS period with average $10/bbl oil price rise above $50
- each $10 give £0.5 -£1.0bn revenue.

At this rate we cover the deficit when oil price is min $180 /bbl if production and costs stay flat forever.

Not going to happen in late life.

299 2018-09-19 23:17:16 Made a riggie sauce base with @Pastabilities82 hot tomato oil. It’s either the best or worst thing I could have done. It’s incredible... thus I will need to buy elastic pants. It’s essentially hot tomato oil Alfredo. #thisiswhyimnotthin
300 2018-09-19 23:17:08 Thieves essential oil is heaven to my nostrils
301 2018-09-19 23:16:59 On that other call I made...WTI oil at $71+ and cdn oil and gas names still trading as if it was $50. Get #TransMountain resolved and these stocks could be doing their best impression of the sexy nurse cannabis dance but with CF today and a future supply crunch still looming.
302 2018-09-19 23:16:39 Have you tried Orajel? It’s amazing! I prefer it to Clive oil, it doesn’t taste minging either 
303 2018-09-19 23:16:38 Just speculating, but there's oil installations there, so a lot of people might temporarily move in from outside of the county from a lot of different places and then start relationships with the few people who live there permanently.
304 2018-09-19 23:16:37 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
305 2018-09-19 23:16:33 Anyone looking to buy a new or preowned vehicle? I will take $500 off the price of the car as well as a year of oil changes for all new vehicles.
306 2018-09-19 23:16:25 Praying!!! Please check into cannibas CBD oil from a doctor. You may have tried this route but if not it’s been recognized by the epilepsy foundation as the most effective medicine on the market

313 2018-09-19 23:15:25 Update: I don’t look like a 2nd grader. However, I smelled something all day. Then realized it smelled like trumpet valve oil. Then realized that the smell was coming FROM MY FACE. This whole skincare thing may not be for me.

342 2018-09-19 23:10:51 What's wrong with gas ? How much oil will it take to change up our infrastructure.

344 2018-09-19 23:10:37 I try to keep mine fairly clean. I don't oil them if I'm grilling beef or pork or chicken, but for fish I will.
345 2018-09-19 23:10:36 Doug, that is based on the winter gas (the scam itself).  You brought down gas prices which lasted less than a week.  You need to get back on top of that promise.  I know you are dealing with oil greed, but...
346 2018-09-19 23:10:31 I got my CBD oil from Fresh thyme

352 2018-09-19 23:10:11 Had perch for dinner. Pan fried it and it was the first time it's ever turned out. I found a recipe that said butter AND oil. I'd never done that before, but it won't be the last!
353 2018-09-19 23:10:05 Hey it's good for Orangutans & has Coconut Oil!
Of course this product is from Australia *everything* in it is upside down.
The 'sport approved' #maltodextrin is the least problem: all the other artificial sweeteners. 
Just on that Even Nutella is healthier than Nuttvia
354 2018-09-19 23:09:15 Biofuels can be very exciting. I saw my first biodiesel plant at an Alabama pulp mill in 2008.  The motivation for adopting this technology was fuel oil pricing.  
This is an interesting process as most biodiesel produces some CO2(eq) in the process of production to combustion.
355 2018-09-19 23:09:13 I feel like I look my age (middle/late 40s) until I see people who are my age...  dang y’all - get some sleep!!  LOL 

I’m gonna need everyone to have a glass of water, some lip balm and an AlbertoVO5 hot oil treatment LOL
356 2018-09-19 23:09:11 #tytlive How much coconut oil does Trump use every day to avoid any of his false-facts from sticking to him?! He must leave a trail similar to a snail when he walks.
357 2018-09-19 23:09:09 Depends. Liquid marijuana like nicotine juice, yes. Dry herb, oil, shatter, hash etc... no. You can buy tanks just for those though, I have one.

Not sure if you can buy the liquid marijuana, I've never looked lol, but I have made it myself and used it in a normal atomizer.
358 2018-09-19 23:09:07 Did you mention that its now just an Oil and Gas lobbying firm? Probably not; truthfulness isn't your strong suit.

362 2018-09-19 23:07:32 Tesla's zero emissions cars are the first carbon tax for oil and gas. Tesla's utility scale lithium batteries at $75/kwh (late next year), are the second and final carbon tax for oil and gas. A tax is anything that reduces the bottom line :-) @Clarknt67
363 2018-09-19 23:07:27 You have no idea what everyone is going through. The fish/oil/waste odor is inescapable. And, the high temperatures exasperates the misery.

364 2018-09-19 23:07:27 Tried CBD oil for the first time today to help with my racing mind and anxiety and it actually really really helped. 10/10 would recommend
365 2018-09-19 23:07:25 When u batter it, use some of the angel food powder mix and fry it in peanut oil. Not that crisco or veggie oil shit
366 2018-09-19 23:07:10 Other manufacturers should be designing #ElectricCars same way #Tesla is and shouldn't be releasing vehicles designed to “kill” other electric cars but instead should be creating vehicles designed to “kill” gas and diesel-powered automobiles and get out of bed with big oil.

369 2018-09-19 23:06:05 Well let's face it, if you don't find an alternative before the oil runs out you'll go bust.

373 2018-09-19 23:05:44 If Europeans want to be healthy, they should stop consuming #nestle products. 
Nestle is amazing at deceiving people into thinking that they are morally & ethically pure but it’s all BS. Do not destroy the rainforest for palm oil! It’s also very terrible for the body! #Unhealthy
374 2018-09-19 23:05:28 @Know_more_news Dude USA froze cash belonging to Iran after the people overthrew the puppet shah in 1979 for giving away their oil! Giving their money back after 36 years with no interest is not paying them off! Stop being a Zionist shill as Adam exposed you!

394 2018-09-19 23:02:15 I totally agree. There is simply no reason that Canada couldn't become every bit as strong, powerful, influential & prosperous as the USA. Hell, they could simply implement what we are NOW doing! Economy growth, lowest unemployment, lowered taxes, increase oil output, etc.
395 2018-09-19 23:01:38 I love watching your content and to be completely honest you have been an inspiration for me to stream my self and build my own community change that oil and hope you feel well soon man :) #teamasmongold

432 2018-09-19 22:56:55 Interesting that many of our inbound calls are from California oil producers looking to put renewables in their vacant lands. It’s also interesting that facing declining demand for diesel, gasoline, & HFO the IOCs are looking to plastics to save the industry.

Are ye now training those pesky meerkats to dig deep enough to hit oil...
434 2018-09-19 22:56:48 Tulsa (1949). Female rancher finds that the only way to beat the oil barons is to join them in surprisingly strong drama with enviromental bent that puts several seasons worth of soap opera type plotting into 90 minutes of film. 7/10

439 2018-09-19 22:56:01 China imports vast quantities of Venezuelan oil.
The US owes China trillions in loans and is waging a trade war against them.

Do the math.

442 2018-09-19 22:55:09 We would have been bankrupt by now if we’d made that choice. We are billions of pounds in debt and the oil prices fell dramatically.
443 2018-09-19 22:54:56 lol really? Hmmm it’s been over 3 years I’ve been on this LCHF lifestyle journey and instead of feeling weak, sick, I’m energetic, full of life BGL at 5.5 n even using the POISON Coconut oil has doubled up my life.. wahahahaha.. they’d try anything..Too late
444 2018-09-19 22:54:52 Sometimes (not 5 times)
And he made money on those bankruptcys & never pd anything to all the small business owners who in good faith performed the work but didnt have the money to go up against trump Lots of these sml businesses went under because trump never pd them
445 2018-09-19 22:54:49 I do not. I let the last meal season it. Burn it hot but not flaming. Then scrape with a wire brush. There may be a particular use for oil, though. I should explore that.
446 2018-09-19 22:54:48 anyway mom is mad at me cos last week i couldn’t go to art class and so i painted at home and left the whole house smelling like oil painting

450 2018-09-19 22:54:32 Seen a couple commercials for @bobforgovernor while waiting in my oil change. So far I know nothing about his plan for CT other than he's going to cut taxes. No info on how that will be paid for. I'm hearing more about @NedLamont in them. Looking what I'm hearing about his plans.
451 2018-09-19 22:54:29 You know those crooked fur traders from that time period we learned about in school? That would be my bet. Or a snake oil salesman in another country. At his core, he's a conman. A grifter. That was probably true in other lifetimes too if you subscribe to that.

456 2018-09-19 22:53:46 Ask them about the use of palm oil?
457 2018-09-19 22:53:46 Finally placing my order tonight for the De-Stress set oil set from @EdensGardenOils

458 2018-09-19 22:53:34 Not to be rude, but he has shown to be a political Prostitute. Changing his mimd every 10 mins, He was the one that suggested to maliki to bring force to pressure KDP to give up its oil deals as per maliki’s own words! Iran is fully behind him, that it self raises many questions!
459 2018-09-19 22:53:34 Last night I used coconut oil as lube for the first time. Life changing.

461 2018-09-19 22:53:26 Photography takes its own special brand of talent and patience.  Drawing is really all about really seeing what's in front of us.  I love Frederick Franck's books for inspiration.  And yes, I did paint my lil avatar.  She's in oil paint on wood.
462 2018-09-19 22:53:25 We can save some money on oil spill clean up at the front end... 
463 2018-09-19 22:53:24 i really appreciate your opinion as a veteran in the industry, along with a few others that speak up as opposing voices against the leading trends. it puts things into perspective for those who have much less experience and can't always see through the snake oil salesman pitches
464 2018-09-19 22:52:59 My mom stole my CBD oil lmao classic

470 2018-09-19 22:52:11 I've just made the best recipe for tofu ever!
Simply brush generously with extra virgin olive oil before lightly tossing it in the bin.
471 2018-09-19 22:52:01 Oil is supposed to be funding all of the UK   according to the nats  , but in reality it does not even cover the cost of free prescriptions in Scotland .
472 2018-09-19 22:51:49 Will Trump let oil prices go up before mid-terms?
473 2018-09-19 22:51:41 @SoMuchBloodJoe do you spread a specific oil on your grill grates before you toss the food on?
474 2018-09-19 22:51:40 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
475 2018-09-19 22:51:33 Instructions unclear, mindstorm blocks now worshipping Yawgmoth and wife is mad about oil on floor
476 2018-09-19 22:51:26 Yay, Yippee, summer is over so now the gas/oil companies will end their regular summer practice of shafting motorists and lower gasoline prices. It’s about damned time too!
477 2018-09-19 22:51:23 @PnPCBC the Venezuela issue is a pure conflict based on lies the former government pre Chavez was far worse&was giving away resources to extremely racist and reactionary big oil>in fact Venezuela problems are due to subversion by paid revolutionary from the globalist ultra rich

479 2018-09-19 22:51:05 I am allergic to palm oil, so options are limited. Haigh's chocolate bullets are not limited, however...

481 2018-09-19 22:50:37 Please go get y'all oil changed, I don't want y'all to blow up
482 2018-09-19 22:50:14 Ted Cruz is the epitome of full of shit politicians. 10 bucks says he jerks off to pictures of young boys and barrels of oil.
483 2018-09-19 22:50:09 Yea, ours isn’t allowed on site washing because of local regs requiring oil separators in drains even though they are washing electric vehicles. But they really shouldn’t be using the car wash they are!
484 2018-09-19 22:50:09 Wow I’m so proud of myself. I successfully fried a pork chop... got oil literally everywhere but that’s okay 
485 2018-09-19 22:49:59 Christ is the assension oil. Christ-oil crisco. Yes it’s coming but Christ is within you. So you understand the metaphor now. It’s happening to you, you are just holding it back with beliefs. 
486 2018-09-19 22:49:54 Pro life tip: if you need to be a hermit at home to get stuff done, put mustard oil in your hair. That shit will take minimum 2-3 washes to get out meaning your ass is not leaving your place of residence for 2 days at least
487 2018-09-19 22:49:45 Snake oil salesmen have to convince you you’re sick before they can sell you the “cure.”

Remember this the next time someone who tells you there’s something wrong with you is the same person selling the “solution.”
488 2018-09-19 22:49:32 Please. Palm oil is amazing bad for your health, if it comes from the Congo... they use child labor
489 2018-09-19 22:49:31 Y'all I put tea tree oil on my face for the first time last night and nobody told me that it BURNS. Like I know beauty hurts but DAMN.

494 2018-09-19 22:49:06 someone needs to make an oil painting of this picture and hang it above a fireplace
495 2018-09-19 22:49:05 Yes but a disadvantage would be that you'd have to carry a clove of garlic, some cider vinegar, olive oil and dijon mustard in your other pocket to have the requisite ingredients to make a nice honey-mustard dressing
496 2018-09-19 22:48:55 Funniest thing I noticed when I moved to bc was that people think the forestry and mining here are better and cleaner than the oil patch. The double standard that's peddled here is hard to swallow when you know better
497 2018-09-19 22:48:39 雨降りです
498 2018-09-19 22:48:34 That doesn’t happen, especially since it’s just CBD oil she uses.

502 2018-09-19 22:48:22 Fuel prices are still no where near where they should be compared to the price of oil.. the excuses for high fuel prices will continue as consumers are forced into an ever escalating sense of normalcy..
503 2018-09-19 22:48:06 In Italy we say "We are like the oil and the Holy water". means that we are totally different. But if I get my nephew on board, she will have to bring him to the cons..

506 2018-09-19 22:47:38 No, that oil is to be burned.
It's not being made into products that have value added and aren't burned.
It's not really complicated, but you don't know the first thing about that tarsands oil or where it is going.
507 2018-09-19 22:47:27 Aye wait fr though what happen if we go too long without getting a oil change ? Because my car still start 
508 2018-09-19 22:47:25 I wonder if Cruz uses Dammper Dan? You know hair oil.
509 2018-09-19 22:47:20 @PnPCBC especially our oil is far better as USA has a far better oil sands technology and therefore Mid East oil of violence and wars based on lies and super class trillionaire war mongers who will do anything to squash competitors like Venezuela where a 1st nations leader>killed
510 2018-09-19 22:47:18 I saw others comment that she just vapes the CBD oil once a week. I guess she said it in a podcast. If it’s just the CBD then she’s not even getting a high.
511 2018-09-19 22:47:16 猛突進ですなwww
512 2018-09-19 22:46:58 It’s so crazy considering they have gold n oil

520 2018-09-19 22:45:46 Blend 8 oz goose with 4 cups kidney beans. Mix in Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve for brunch
521 2018-09-19 22:45:43 Good point below how come Alberta just refine more of its own high value oil based products instead of worry about exporting raw oil?
522 2018-09-19 22:45:42 Bwahahahahahahaha you’re delusional. It is the GOP that is power hungry and corrupt from the bottom of their NRA payoffs to the top of their oil and gas cronies.
523 2018-09-19 22:45:33 Lmao heyyy girl I been telling myself imma go get a oil. Ha he for the last like week now,we gotta do better.
524 2018-09-19 22:45:31 if the sea salt trick doesn’t work, try cleaning it with pure baby castile soap with warm water and a q-tip. pure tea tree oil works wonders too, i apply it every night, hope this helps!
525 2018-09-19 22:45:29 Cbd oil is amazing. I would recommend that anyone who is living with chronic pain try it.
526 2018-09-19 22:45:23 I’m just play bihhhh get out’em......I owe you that from playing with me about changing oil
527 2018-09-19 22:45:22 right. however, i was like wow i can make so much rose oil + bath salt + lotion. lol 
528 2018-09-19 22:45:19 A Midas store in Sacramento had a sign board advertising Pumpkin Spice oil changes.
529 2018-09-19 22:45:15 yeah mine are always finding something to get into!  and oil and water don’t mix so the oil stays on the top anyways even after you mix them it’ll separate 
530 2018-09-19 22:45:11 @JustinTrudeau Who as Canada sits would want to invest here. All we hv to offer on our stock market is oil,gas,gold,mining and Marijuana. Get this country into other markets. Get your ass out there and find other markets. If u can’t do it  me and I will show u how
531 2018-09-19 22:45:09 2/2 - Provincial and private debt is very important when assessing the integrity of the country. Especially when looking at subjects like the oil sands in Alberta. Some estimates put Alberta’s debt at $71B by 2019-20. Spending is already increasing $146M above what was budgeted.
532 2018-09-19 22:45:06 Rock Calendar 9-19-10: The BP oil well that spilled hundred of millions of galllons of oil into the Gulf is sealed with a permanent plug.
533 2018-09-19 22:44:31 Why dont you get the fed to start imposing fines on Quebec and other provinces for importing foreign oil (from US and Saudi) and promote buying Alberta Oil.  Yeah and cut the taps off on BC already for gods sake.
534 2018-09-19 22:44:28 من المفترض عدم ادخال العنصر النسائي في هكذا برامج عشان لاتسير مصخررره وخروج عن التقاليد
535 2018-09-19 22:44:26 OIL!!!!
536 2018-09-19 22:44:17 They are balls of palm oil. I agree with you. I'd much rather have a ball of pure chocolate. They usually use the Brand "Lindor" for the chocolates with large proportions of palm oil in, presumably to warn off people who hate its taste.
537 2018-09-19 22:44:12 How much oil do you have in there. That's usually a sign of too much oil or water getting into the oil reservoir.
538 2018-09-19 22:44:00 Marigold oil, more commonly known as calendula oil, is often seen in skin care products. In skin care products, calendula may sooth inflammation and irritation, and increase blood flow to skin cells giving your skin an overall healthier appearance. #skincare #calendulaoil
539 2018-09-19 22:43:56 @PnPCBC the pipeline issue is plagued by the big big money of fake environmental groups that get money from Saudi - Israel - Rothschild alliance that wants to sell stolen oil from the Golan heights ( occupied Syria where the original inhabitants were forced out > ethnic cleansin

541 2018-09-19 22:43:49 I would get a heavy staple, like olive oil.
542 2018-09-19 22:43:35 Yup - the ATAs one sided ideological choice is a slap in the face to Albertans IMO - however the world will not stop turning if she speaks.  In fact - she should speak.  Have a debate and bring in someone debating the merits of oil.   Point - counterpoint.  But no threats!
543 2018-09-19 22:43:32 It relaxes your body, at the very least. Not your mind though...Still working on that one! Another tip: lavender oil is relaxing too.
544 2018-09-19 22:43:27 Smoking “weed” is not a sober lifestyle. Using CBD oil is also different than smoking weed.
545 2018-09-19 22:43:03 Anadanko hash oil and petroleum
546 2018-09-19 22:42:27 "If you don't like it build a competitor" is not a response if something is a monopoly, the same could be said of any monopoly that was broken up, Standard Oil, etc. Am sure there was a Yahoo! of oil.
547 2018-09-19 22:42:13 I have Peppermint oil going in my diffuser and new baby busted down my door talking about some "you told me our mints were gone." She really thinks she runs me, that's why there ain't mints, just oil

549 2018-09-19 22:41:33 I’ve made plans Friday evening with 4 different people. Little do they know Friday night I will be sat at home, on my own,  finishing my oil paintings.
550 2018-09-19 22:41:29 We all do,trust me...its hope that has been taken from us..not money nor oil..we have no future in this conditions..
551 2018-09-19 22:41:25 So much to unpack here. 

1) she’s a grown up and he’s not her dad 
2) she does respect his sobriety - she’s not holding him down and demanding he vape cbd oil 
3) CBD OIL DOESN’T GET YOU HIGH & HAS MEDICINAL VALUE
4) a person’s sobriety is their responsibility
552 2018-09-19 22:41:25 My roommate is eating plain salmon. No salt. No pepper. No oil. No seasonings. Just plain salmon...REHEATED IN THE MICROWAVE. I have to move out of this place yesterday.

560 2018-09-19 22:39:47 Oil dependency is bad. M'kay...
561 2018-09-19 22:39:38 Daddy was a badass, oil field white trash. Never took nobody's lip. He was a honkytonk dancer and even beat cancer.
562 2018-09-19 22:39:36 Totally in agreement but what commercially produced vegetable oil hasn’t destroyed natural habitat. At some point in history. Rapeseed and corn oil have a lot to answer for too.
563 2018-09-19 22:39:32 People never get oil changes & wonder why they car don’t work.
564 2018-09-19 22:39:25 Women Get In The Car & Don't Check The Oil Or Nothing. All They Care About Is If It Has Gas In The Tank. 
565 2018-09-19 22:39:11 A new study shows that using CBD oil prior to intercourse relaxes you and women experience an orgasm more to their liking.
 Much better!
566 2018-09-19 22:38:47 Burned bridges means not being a slave to US corporations who take majority of profits from the oil.  Productivity is a huge issue in Latin America.

567 2018-09-19 22:38:41 GOOD NEWS to all and be prepared with our lamps full of oil for the grooms return.  I am trying to get you to see that what is happening in our country is SPIRITUAL. GODS Word reveals this to those whom believe. All I ask is to pray to know his will for you.

578 2018-09-19 22:36:39 I wanna go there! I want my doughnut fresh, and I wanna see this cider factory. Matter a fact I’ll need a truck on the way back. I’m bringing cider to Colorado. Then we’ll do up a couple gallons of #ZooJuice designed for Thanksgiving. Age a spell before I add my part. 90% oil.
579 2018-09-19 22:36:35 As a #vegan would you knowingly consume palm oil or palm related products?

If you could also retweet so this question can reach a wider audience it would be much appreciated, many thanks in advance for your time. Love and peace Gary...
580 2018-09-19 22:36:20 I had the same problem & just gave up lol, only flat twists don’t come out puffy on me. Maybe try using more gel or a product with more hold & oil on the roots?

595 2018-09-19 22:33:59 Cars are naturally selected every min of every day as they *compete for limited resources* BY DEFAULT. These include, a place on the road, a place to park, fuel consumption, oil consumption, what they can carry, safety, speed, acceleration, etc.
596 2018-09-19 22:33:58 Obama opened the Arctic to oil drilling TWICE.  Obama promoted fracking around the world.  Obama approved of oil pipeline installation near bodies of drinking water.

BOTH PARTIES ARE CORRUPT!  What do you not understand?

599 2018-09-19 22:33:00 oil does that
when its hotter it expands
the inside of a hay bale would get fairly hot esp in our Australian sun.

603 2018-09-19 22:32:30 Step away from Twitter and learn the difference between pot, cbd oil, and vape juice. You have zero idea what people “walking around vaping all day” are actually vaping. Then you should get stoned and take a nap because you seem easily bothered.

606 2018-09-19 22:31:21 It is criminal of Pakistan to beg Saudis for $4Bil, China for $2 bil., Other countries for a few more to finance Imports of luxuries and oil to provide electricity for Air Conditioners.

611 2018-09-19 22:30:21 So, I always listen to [unintentional] ASMR before bed - and I’ve ended up down a rabbit hole of different topics. 

One is “Young Living” - Question: 

People seem to put “lemon oil” in their drinks/food.... is there a reason it’s better than just squeezing a damn lemon?  
612 2018-09-19 22:30:14 well... up until I completely saturated my face with palm kernel oil. now it just feels extremely greasy.
613 2018-09-19 22:30:11 We should not get involved in Venezuela . It would be for the oil ! Their country and not ours!
614 2018-09-19 22:30:09 But oh what fun chopping them up and frying them in super hot oil.
615 2018-09-19 22:29:57 one of the guys in my warehouse is going to check it tomorrow and i’m going to take it in for an oil change this weekend. we shall seeeee what happens lol
616 2018-09-19 22:29:52 This one was with chickpea spinach burger, red onion, tomatoes, salad, vegan mayonnaise and sriracha! 
And in the other bowl is avocado with salt, lemon, olive oil, cayenne pepper. The salad one is just a mix of everything; spinach, motocoupler and other lettuce, cucumber,

623 2018-09-19 22:27:59 Wind turbines ineffective? They produce 15% of our energy and are more cost effective than oil gas or coal.

631 2018-09-19 22:27:20 when you oil your legs and feet up it makes walking in heels an extreme sport.
632 2018-09-19 22:26:58 I was commenting on the get up he had on . But for what it’s worth, I agree with you.Those are my tax dollars after all , I want them used for the health and well-being of Canadians not wasted on well healed special interest groups like the oil industry.

635 2018-09-19 22:26:41 I read a book about the origin of the FBI contrary to popular belief; it started over the murders of the Osage Indians. We pushed them around & moved them onto crappy land we didn’t want and they struck oil.

647 2018-09-19 22:24:45 FYI... I dropped my car off  @FirestoneAuto this morning at 7:30am.. Needed an oil change and tire rotation. They said they would have it done by lunch. It's now 6:25pm and I'm standing in the waiting room while they rush to do it.
648 2018-09-19 22:24:42 Gas prices all across Canada were down more than in Ontario this week so either you are lying or the oil companies are making a fortune by not passing on the savings.
649 2018-09-19 22:24:29 I see you frienddddd 
650 2018-09-19 22:24:25 i do like every night! i think with my eczema the lotion/oil makes my skin not breathe so it itches really bad, plus the skin stretching is not a good combo

Gordon Ramsay knows how to entertain
669 2018-09-19 22:22:11 The loss came from Maduro firing all the experts who handled the oil and hired his own lackeys who didn't know their stuff. They weren't hired on merit.

This is why capitalism and private businesses worth their salt are better than the ineffectual government.
670 2018-09-19 22:22:07 So you are saying Alberta is just a proxy for the oil industry ?

The ATA has 40,000 members. 22,000 people work in the oilsands

So in truth it is far more anti-Alberta for you to keep attacking the ATA.

Just sayin'

682 2018-09-19 22:21:08 No discussion of Venezuela is complete without disclosing Russia bailed out Venezuela’s state owned oil company in 2016, who used 49.9% of Citgo as collateral. If Venezuela misses a single payment, Russia takes ownership of U.S. based Citgo. Trump doing Russia’s dirty work again.
683 2018-09-19 22:21:08 Yes it is I put oil on it
684 2018-09-19 22:21:03 Well I just made a new hair oil but forgot to add aloe Vera powder to the infusion bag. So that sucks. Added lavender though.

688 2018-09-19 22:19:57 The capital haemorrhaging from the Highlands & Islands led to depopulation, and still does. Islay had silver mines and Highland cattle production fed England, but they've left as little wealth behind as oil.

693 2018-09-19 22:18:54 I am more concerned about oil workers getting retrained off a dying industry & diversifying economy. Since when did tolerance for LGBTQ become an agenda. The level of anger in AB is a direct result of Cons mismanagement of economy & grotesque inequality championed by Kenney ....
694 2018-09-19 22:18:51 Wow i would actually consider driving that car now if it was lit on fire and dumped into a lake of oil
695 2018-09-19 22:18:49 You know CBD oil is legal for everyone right?....
696 2018-09-19 22:18:44 What you should be asking is what has the Trump administration done to Venezuela to get to your vast oil reserves!
697 2018-09-19 22:18:43 My hairdresser told me to try oil pulling as an extra defense against cavities? Keep in mind neither of us know anything bout teeth but
698 2018-09-19 22:18:29 What in the heck is an oil diffuser?
699 2018-09-19 22:17:52 So then, why not sell California to Mexico? Keep the oil and gas rights, mineral rights, water rights, and let Mexico have Hollywood!

707 2018-09-19 22:16:04 You've done the same to David Suzuki and several environmental advocates. We can have a robust debate about oil sands development without attacking individuals institutions. We can win an election on the merit of our argument and not resorting to calculated fearmongering.
708 2018-09-19 22:16:04 These are the Cons who scream about free speech until it's someone questioning the oil companies or pipelines. Then they try desperately to shut everyone down.
709 2018-09-19 22:15:58 I just checked the oil in my car myself because I’m butch
710 2018-09-19 22:15:55 If you want to believe that higher oil prices HELP economic growth, I've got a bridge to sell you.
711 2018-09-19 22:15:19 So I saw this thing on fb that was like what this with something you can’t do and all my cants that came to mind are typical girl things. But I can totally do typical guy things. Like change a tire, check oil and all that shit. I can take apart a cars interior

716 2018-09-19 22:15:03 Doctor appointments are like getting oil changes. They only give you bad news
717 2018-09-19 22:14:51 Shoes dry from vinegar, now massaged with neatsfoot oil. Most final printing done, and reorganization of boxes done. Am I finished and now able to relax?

Of course not. I just don't know what else I've got to do yet... :D
718 2018-09-19 22:14:49 We have to send them OPEC ministers a message, 45 days before election day, the president should replace the amount of oil they cut back on during the election season to inflate the price at the pump so Americans vote for Democrats, by doing so they wont manipulate the electorate
719 2018-09-19 22:14:44 My sister bought me CBD oil & its me trying it for the first time but lemme tell you it taste like  lol but I definitely feel it & i took it while having my normal anxiety attacks during the day and it went away surprisingly!
720 2018-09-19 22:14:40 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
721 2018-09-19 22:14:26 Do you know what this is? It's a one-deem coin. It's the price for a pound of bread, or a bottle of oil.
722 2018-09-19 22:14:23 Best price and place to get an oil change? 
Maribella Alex free next Thursday early morning?
723 2018-09-19 22:14:19 Oil money cannot buy a fashion
724 2018-09-19 22:14:12 These people who make statements like this.. have never been past a desk job with administrative tasks.. jobs that don’t really go any where.. they have never got into an oil & gas executive’s off the line personalised Porsche or Range Rover, they really don’t know, forgive them.
725 2018-09-19 22:14:11 This Venezuela crisis is manufactured by sanctions, embargoes.Venezuela has the worlds largest oil reserves, the empire wants that oil. The empire doesn't care about people, our humanity, just look at what they've done to the middle east.
726 2018-09-19 22:14:01 idk who’s daughter needs to hear this today but, get an oil change
727 2018-09-19 22:13:54 It is such an amazing oil!
728 2018-09-19 22:13:40 sesame ..oil ..... is for flavour ......... 
729 2018-09-19 22:13:40 Bard Oil is just ale

732 2018-09-19 22:13:32 coconut oil vs sudocreme : a battle to the death
733 2018-09-19 22:13:32 However you spelt Venezuela
It still spells disaster. 
It is approaching a million percent inflation. 
It is also a country rich in oil.
734 2018-09-19 22:13:28 กูเพลียจัดหรอ หลับตั้งแต่1ทุ่ม ตื่นตี5 55555ขอหลับต่ออีกสัก2ชั่วโมงนะ
735 2018-09-19 22:13:23 Brilliant  point. So many of these fad diets love to cut out very important food groups or make them seem like they are the enemy of good health.  It changes rapidly too. One month coconut oil is all the rage and the next month it's bad .
736 2018-09-19 22:12:32 Is that the same Venezuela that the US is undermining? Where they're looking to change the regime? The Venezuela that has oil? That Venezuela?? Oh right. 
Poor bastards don't stand a chance against CIA. 
No I'm not a labour/ Corbyn supporter before you imply same.
737 2018-09-19 22:12:32 Last night to enter into the CBD OIL drawing ....Winner will be announced at tomorrow night's live .

738 2018-09-19 22:12:19 Hmm, sorry to hear that. 
Did you take the oil by mouth?
739 2018-09-19 22:12:18 That is because his beard oil is a known allergen.
740 2018-09-19 22:12:16 I had to look that up. I don't really do that. i try my best to limit the amount of heat i use and i only use a wide tooth comb. 90% of the time i only put oil in my hair but sometimes i use cantu curling cream
741 2018-09-19 22:11:40 So I've discovered that oil painting is much fucking easier than acrylic :')
742 2018-09-19 22:11:33 Shopping!

744 2018-09-19 22:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: burning crust with sweet motor oil and philly beef.

746 2018-09-19 22:10:46 I post everything I use for my hair on my IG highlighted story “my hair”  but other than that my hair is in a protective style 24/7 with a hair growth oil
747 2018-09-19 22:10:22 フラン姐さんに殴られたなう
748 2018-09-19 22:10:16 Ohh okay do they sell the cbd oil there cheaper or
749 2018-09-19 22:10:13 RT @LivingSafely: #Pringles Cheddar Cheese this September? With less than 2% actual Cheddar Cheese, it has more salt, oil or MSG!
750 2018-09-19 22:10:10 @SUBWAY I really like the mild taste of the oil and vinegar used for the meals! How can the general public access the oil and vinegar for home use?
751 2018-09-19 22:10:06 えるしっているか、遠藤氏は油しか飲まない。
752 2018-09-19 22:09:41 Are you guys naive?  Of course they are!  Every spy novel starts in a Swiss bank.  They don't like you. They like war and oil and profit 
Start a REAL Green Revolution and you will see Daech against you.

Scared?
Join the club.
753 2018-09-19 22:09:39 I always had the stories, my stake in family farms and ranch and oil and gas business, it just gave me a chip, I took on looking after my mom and she consumed her life with my activities and the things I did.
754 2018-09-19 22:09:39 Apply peppermint essential oil to the back of your neck, or diffuse !
755 2018-09-19 22:09:36 "She's probably passed out." Then who took the photo?

"Not the empty liqour bottles." I can see a nearly full bottle of olive oil, what looks like a bottle of red wine vinigar, and an empty glass pitcher for flowers or something. The rest i can't make out.
756 2018-09-19 22:09:27 I’m glad the coconut oil hype died down
757 2018-09-19 22:09:25 Tea tree oil, of course! Didn't realize what it was, just used it topically.
758 2018-09-19 22:09:24 I don't use any of their products. Palm Oil needs to be stopped NOW. Its barbaric what these corporations do.
759 2018-09-19 22:09:11 I got as close as I could to the scene without crossing the yellow caution tape.

I'm still looking for a large collection of photos and videos taken the night that the pipe burst that had mineral oil in it.  The oil cooled off the electrical wires underneath Main Street.
760 2018-09-19 22:08:56 Scotland, please ready to pay your own way in the World. This may no l;onger be words or arguments about value of dwindling oil, but running out of food, because English wallets and taxes are being closed off by LAW.
761 2018-09-19 22:08:50 なけなしの金を切り崩していってるし
使うなと言われたらそれまでなんだろうけど
762 2018-09-19 22:08:24 Actually this is in reference to pipeline toll fees for NOC to use the privately built pipeline that goes through Kurdistan and ties into the ITP at Fishkabur in order to export Kirkuk oil.
763 2018-09-19 22:08:14  and all it will take is for Oil to move $5, and then will need to spend a few more billion defending 75
764 2018-09-19 22:08:06 .@collinpeterson @RepTomEmmer @USRepRickNolan @RepTimWalz @KristiNoem thank you for your bipartisan support of the #RFS and your letter to #EPA advocating to stop handing out waivers for big oil refiners while encouraging year round #E15 sales.
765 2018-09-19 22:07:29 Ahh the smell of R filling the air on the first warm up lap of the day. Despite synthetic oil being available I used Castrol R for my son's 100cc two stroke kart engines. 16:1 ratio from memory. Only had one seizure when I swapped carbs in a panic session and set it too lean
766 2018-09-19 22:07:22 @realDonaldTrump Mr. Pres. the economy is booming, jobs are being created, manufacturing is coming back,,, also our natural resources such as coal, gas, oil etc. you have given back to the American people,,, now let's take back our government and flush the swamp down the drain.
767 2018-09-19 22:07:15 まだ平日終わらないの
768 2018-09-19 22:07:09 How many Bolton’s mechanics does it take to change oil? If you’re driving a 1972 Chevelle, apparently 8. Do y’all need some help down there guys??
769 2018-09-19 22:07:07 Usually those types of burns only happen with hot water so tbh that is not bad at all for hot oil
770 2018-09-19 22:07:00 Yep agree. There also wasn’t term oil in the locker room No didn’t allow it the leaders 75, 58, 59 47 policed it.  Off the field they had some characters when they came to work it was all biz and team focused on winning
771 2018-09-19 22:06:50 really cannot wait for this cbd oil to arrive at my door and punch me in the face

776 2018-09-19 22:06:14 ほんと
777 2018-09-19 22:06:09 Credit should go to Ogun state without the traditional federal support from oil proceeds and establishments.
778 2018-09-19 22:06:05 Sounds like you got some bad oil
Because CBD is the truth 
779 2018-09-19 22:06:04 Drain his oil and slash his tyres 
780 2018-09-19 22:05:56 I myself have used CBD oil for my anxiety and it has helped so much. I am currently trying the powder form of CBD and it also is helping so much. It has helped me in so many ways with different things wrong with me.
781 2018-09-19 22:05:43 Proper planning? So what are they doing now? Execution? Why don't you come and teach oil companies that spend millions Of USD searching for oil without finding how to do feasibility study? 
782 2018-09-19 22:05:39 冗談はさておき神楽坂の「Dolce Vita」とか代官山の「VOM FASS」とか新宿伊勢丹の「OLIOTECA」とか銀座の「OIL&VINEGAR」とか上野毛の「74 cabotte」梅田にもある「OLIVO」みたいなオリーブオイル専門店巡っていいオリーブオイルに巡り会いたいよね。量り売りのオリーブオイルとか真面目に超アガる。

785 2018-09-19 22:05:18 And you call yourself a Christian?  You’re no better than a snake oil salesman.
786 2018-09-19 22:05:08 $TSLA - First it was Big Oil hating on our protagonist. Then Big Auto got involved. Next, the nasty Big Shorties are working fiendishly to hate the planet. Now, Big Rail is keeping cars from customers. Lastly Big Government is on the job to crush the Dear Leader's Dream. Sad day!
787 2018-09-19 22:04:58 My 11 yr old just asked me mom if vegetable oil comes from vegetables where does baby oil come from

790 2018-09-19 22:04:20 Oh far from it, just my opinions wld not have Scotland as a bankrupt state, 100% dependent of wildly fluctuating oil prices, & given the oil is running out.....
791 2018-09-19 22:04:18 If my tweets are not enough to show my hate, Hollywood scums, look at Lake Erie's oil.

792 2018-09-19 22:04:16 I lived there for 2006-10, working on the construction of the Sakhalin I and Sakhalin II oil and gas facilities.
793 2018-09-19 22:04:03 Truman & Acheson, btw, resisted efforts by Churchill (Iran hated the Brits) to completely control Iranian oil to the detriment of the Iranian people. The seed for what happened in 1979 was planted by US using the CIA in '53 to overthrow legit government.
794 2018-09-19 22:03:58 Acosta blew it.  Hmmm. Imagine my shock and dismay
795 2018-09-19 22:03:48 Try potato tacos it’s corn tortillas with some kind of mashed potatoes (not the American kind) fried in oil with salsa it’s so good

797 2018-09-19 22:03:34 I’m sure it’s an abhorrent situation being stuck like they are. Meantime, they’re fed, in shelter such as it is, and not bombed. 
The atrocity begins when world leaders care more for money/oil/power, than the people. We must heal at the source.
798 2018-09-19 22:03:10 For Sale: 2000 F-150, runs great but has a lot of rust. New tires, new plugs, new rear brakes, A/C, heat, power windows, CD player, and fresh oil change. Asking $2000 OBO

Would you be kind enough to direct me to where i can find out more about heritage and its funding and ownership.

806 2018-09-19 22:01:31 Your head get crude oil
807 2018-09-19 22:01:22 Companies been exploring for oil off the coast of Guyana for decades. It started well before 2015. (your profile pic BTW, that's some graffiti I did back in 2011 in Brighton. I love it when the universe sends an echo of the past)
808 2018-09-19 22:01:22 Market Musing

Mexican Peso be fine tho

Gbp the return of the widow maker-those daily bearish candles are pressure pure

812 2018-09-19 22:00:50 おは！！！ぺろ！！！
813 2018-09-19 22:00:47 And @Harvard too. But then there's a lot more Cornell and Harvard should be doing, like divesting their portfolios of natural gas, oil and coal.
814 2018-09-19 22:00:45 Of course I go to get my complimentary oil change and tire rotation, but there’s a nail in my tire that needs patched...  That’s why they say, “nothing is free...”
815 2018-09-19 22:00:43 @Danire212 thanks for like. My family is from Oklahoma and Louisiana worked in the oil business laying big gas lines all over southeast and as far north as Minnesota. My dad and me worked for Latex, which became Flint. My uncle Cecile worked for Haliburton, great company.

822 2018-09-19 22:00:06 The #1 concern with our CBD oil has been the need to give them without food, and typically about 60-90 mins before food. Well, now we can offer you CBD oil from Pet Releaf that can be given with food! 

Step right up, CBD w/ Liposomes. Available now!

827 2018-09-19 21:59:39 I suppose spreading that stuff around the city in walkable park locations wouldn't have made as much of a statement. Oil town.
828 2018-09-19 21:59:29 I will not stop until I am given the opportunity to show the people that my CRR Machine Recovery Restoring all disasters algae bloom toxins bacteria oil spill from the waters returning back to the lakes canals bays River and deep seas 90% pure water let us help.

829 2018-09-19 21:59:04 This is just a gamer, go play and let the grownups run things. Burn more oil. 7% of the oil today used on gamers, bet you hate oil too.
830 2018-09-19 21:59:04 If we setup a crown refinery, nationalize the oil industry, and sell it ourselves, much like Norway, it will make a ton of money.

The oil companies are already heavily subsidized and making mad bank, might as well take out the middle man and just run it ourselves.
831 2018-09-19 21:58:50  no annointing oil sis

834 2018-09-19 21:58:20 Speaking purely hypothetically here but I strongly advise everyone to never consume rosé, CBD oil, and cold brew in the same hour. I definitely didn’t do it but I BET if I did it would be bad, so don’t do it! Especially if you’re about to get on a plane. Then definitely not!!
835 2018-09-19 21:57:38 Man I tell ya, @JergensUS Wet Skin Moisturizer with coconut oil is the absolute bomb as hell product. I am addicted to this stuff anytime I'm in the shower. Can't get enough of it.
836 2018-09-19 21:57:28 i basically have the same melting point as coconut oil

848 2018-09-19 21:55:30 Getting my oil changed and the guy brings me my air filter.

“Have you ever thought about your air filter?”

Me: hmm no I never think about my air filter. 

*never stops thinking about if I should be thinking about my air filter*
849 2018-09-19 21:55:15 I wish I could help OnlyEnnui but I don't have any answers for you. Have you considered cannabis oil? There was a thread about it on the BB forum, for some it seemed to help. And if I remember there was a thread on Gingko Biloba. Some of these things might help but who knows?
850 2018-09-19 21:55:10 this guy at jiffy lube is like "you need someone to help you keep track of what's going on with your car"

excuse me? that's what you guys do. i come in here for my oil changes to hear the spiel, make a list, and get it done elsewhere.
851 2018-09-19 21:54:35 An MOT for £39 !?!  - how much for an oil change ...(and possibly a reissued number plate )
852 2018-09-19 21:54:27 Why don't they tell us what the main sticking points are in broad strokes?

Lumber?
Supply Management?
Auto?
Oil?

What are they trying to get for Canada is holding things up?

856 2018-09-19 21:54:13 What type of anointing oil are you using? Think I need some of that 
857 2018-09-19 21:54:13 Oil blasted thru the T. Time to go long? Or do u wait a candle or 2 and if so does the T become support?  I know we will learn this but getting a jump start.
858 2018-09-19 21:54:05 I WANT THE $20 oil change ONLY
859 2018-09-19 21:53:58 If u are a corp member female...studied engineering interested in working in an oil firm in eti osa LGA,DM asap
860 2018-09-19 21:53:51 So some of these names I recognise..does it mean they use palm oil to help process those?
861 2018-09-19 21:53:51 my dad picked up my car to take it to get an oil change and he said when he went inside the car it smells like Coachella because it smelled like weed Lmao
862 2018-09-19 21:53:43 Your divisive. Two sets of standards, the Anglo standard and the one that applies to all others? 
Ridiculas pathetic pandering just like #CrookedHillary and her "I ain't tired no ways no how" BS. 
Texans see through your phoney rhetoric.

865 2018-09-19 21:53:23 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
866 2018-09-19 21:53:22 You're welcome! I love CBD oil, which is the form I've tried so far, but I've heard that vaping is a faster delivery method, so it's on my list to try next. I hope it helps you, too. I can't tolerate most pharmaceuticals, but this causes no side effects for me.
867 2018-09-19 21:53:17 My daughter worked out in the oil patch for years, the only female in the company. One reason why there are so few women working in it is that women don’t want to work outside doing physical work in the winter in N. Alberta.
868 2018-09-19 21:52:57 all that i have eaten today is a Choco Taco, cold brew, and Marlboro Lights... see y’all at my panic attack/meltdown/crash landing in an hour or so.

870 2018-09-19 21:52:44 We don't use the term coconut here, that I'm aware of. A lot of white women are deeply in love with coconut oil, but that's the extent of it
871 2018-09-19 21:52:44 Allah sarki wallhy we gave him work last semester and did it very well
872 2018-09-19 21:52:38 Big mint fan meself  I’ve a mint oil in an oil burner in the office to keep my focussed buy it’s the sickly candy mint rather than the smell of fresh mint. I add lime oil to sharpen it up.
873 2018-09-19 21:52:33 You are right. It isn’t the same. The position for the SNP was good then, given the oil price. Now, with a much lower oil price, affording good public services in Scotland is dependent on being in the union.
874 2018-09-19 21:52:29 Now the number1 expensive demanded commodity in the world is "Oil" which 50% of African counties has but they all poor n we only has "Gold,Diamond etc" but we number1 and all those infrastructure we have is the driver of our economy n the ANC has gat nothing to do with it..

"The UK can no longer meet its own heat and power demands with indigenous supply. We are increasingly vulnerable to fluctuations in international supply of oil and gas and even the smallest change in energy imports could have a dramatic effect." 2/4
878 2018-09-19 21:52:05 Well, You ain't from Houston, I have actually have met folks that were born here. LOL Not many left. I arrived in the 70s , worked the oil fields, the refineries, temp labor, seen it all.  Left and always came back. Song" TX in the Rear View Mirror"  I hoped would happen.
879 2018-09-19 21:52:03 Wow and this is the religion of peace. Yeah more like the religion of oil money that buys appeasement from our corrupt politicians and establishments

887 2018-09-19 21:50:26 The only thing I have ever agreed to with this man is the fake weapons of mass destruction which was merely an excuse to get Iraqi oil. And that all went down, thousands of our men and women died for the two largest oilmen, saddam and GWBush.
888 2018-09-19 21:50:12 I want longer lashes has anyone got tips I have been using coconut oil and vasaline for months and I feel like it’s doing absolutely nothing, ( i read online they stimulate hair follicles)
889 2018-09-19 21:50:07 Super hesitant on getting an oil change, but not even second guessing my custom made bowling ball purchase for a league I play in once a year...

893 2018-09-19 21:49:27 Mustard oil is in general considered good for external applications for human body, but certainly more difficult to digest than say sesame oil. In North, it is used also for pickles; everyday cooking in mustard oil is rare. 

Moong, in general, is easier to digest than Urad.
894 2018-09-19 21:49:24 But we still have the electricity issue. It comes from oil, gas and coal......
895 2018-09-19 21:49:21 I could never understand people who fry food with little to no oil at all, like how do they do it? I always end up burning my food. Thank God I had pizza in the fridge .
896 2018-09-19 21:49:19 Beto says what his supporters want based on the crowd. That being said, this should be addressed Friday at debate while all of Texas is watching. Also his stance on guns and the oil & gas industry which is Texas' bread & butter since Beto leans more tree hugger

921 2018-09-19 21:46:49 All I'm saying is that if Lightning McQueen asked me to give him an oil change I would do it. 

Strictly platonic. 

Not weird.

934 2018-09-19 21:45:50 I think you can, I don’t really know I just don’t because it’s literally oil and if I don’t wear makeup (which most days I don’t) my skin is pretty oily all day
935 2018-09-19 21:45:49 My cousin just told me that one time her oil light came on and she kept driving her car for two months. Now she mad her car shaking!
936 2018-09-19 21:45:37 What’s a dad for if not to remind you to change your oil?

942 2018-09-19 21:44:14 That was never going to happen. Everyone knows how to play Trump. 

Bigger problem, way bigger, will be if China manages to unseat dollar as currency for oil, or dollar loses its place as world's reserve currency.
943 2018-09-19 21:44:05 One of my first memories was traveling on a bus in 1977 with my mother, to see my grandfather for the last time. I remember thinking it strange that hundreds of men were standing outside near a fire in an oil drum. Not surprised my uncle eventually left for a new job elsewhere.
944 2018-09-19 21:43:55 Nothing at all, just an oil change xd
945 2018-09-19 21:43:50 I can still recall that a mystical and wonderful Indian ESTJ oil heiress, confidently unbuttoning a cadet blue denim pair of flip-flops, is gazing up at a clear night sky filled with a billion distant suns, reclining next to a beautiful brindle palomino.

958 2018-09-19 21:41:56 With that being said my oil is at 20% and I need to make an appointment but I know it’s gonna be a waste of time, because it’s still gonna take all damn day because it’s free

980 2018-09-19 21:38:25 Neither do I. Do you have any actual evidence as to your reason for the fall in oil prices? I have not seen that version on MSM. Or anywhere else for that matter.

988 2018-09-19 21:37:33 Hi. It's your queer dad reminding you to get your oil changed!
989 2018-09-19 21:37:16 That’s just not very accurate to say very, very few. IE: roofers, most construction workers, people on oil rigs, Alaskan fish boats, firefighters, the police. Many of whom work with zero health insurance. I love what Davis did, but I think folks have a right to be critical.

997 2018-09-19 21:36:27 Texas produces 4.6 million bbls of oil per day. More than all but 3 countries.  Texas will collect $15-19 billion royalties in 2018.  But my property taxes are out of control. Where is all the money going?
998 2018-09-19 21:36:21 I had the same issue! What worked for me was to give my hair a break! I stopped bleaching it swtitched my shampoo to one without sulfate! Try conditioner first then shampoo. Cut it and do hair treatments! But coconut oil heat it up and apply to your ends as
999 2018-09-19 21:36:06 Do u polish that dome with olive oil or crico?

1001 2018-09-19 21:35:52 Also our oil activity is excluded, only the Tories would do this kind of accounting.
Anything to damage Scotland.

If she doesn't show, hold the vote.

1007 2018-09-19 21:35:04 It is difficult to find many products that don't contain palm oil now, I don't know how we stop this before it's too late.

1010 2018-09-19 21:34:48 Aaand...Oil is up more than 50% relative to same time 13 most ago.

1014 2018-09-19 21:34:17 Crude oil stock levels including SPR is now just 10 MM barrels more than Deecember 2014 levels. Infrastucture additions such as pipeline fills, new tanks and export tanks added at least 70 MM barrels to crude inventory.
1015 2018-09-19 21:33:38 Now that I've expedited the Assignment of Options and Oil Interests, I return to your important question: Do fish know they're wet? The short answer is No. The long answer is also No. Bertrand Russell put it most effectively when he replied: How do I know, I'm not a fucking fish.
1016 2018-09-19 21:33:25 @DJGloveRepair What is the process to clean a glove w/ Murphy’s Oil Soap? Do you dilute? If so, how much? Do you jus use soap & a rag or do you let the soap sit for a while? 
I’ve had mixed results with a couple different methods.

1023 2018-09-19 21:32:28 Day 1 CBD oil experiment results are in.  Definitely DID do something... and it was good.  Feel it wearing off just now, so as I notice.  Looking forward with great expectations to Day 2!

1026 2018-09-19 21:32:14 For my new face streamer. But Lavender has always been in the oil collection lol
1027 2018-09-19 21:32:05 I decided olbas oil would be good for my cold. Now it is in my sodding eye. I bet that is just how it works by making your entire face weep.
1028 2018-09-19 21:32:02 Is there a tax hack involved? I know the last shakeout got their cost structure lower by buying gear at auction, know a guy who bought “spent” wells in the Permian a decade ago who got free oil from the fracking around him.

1030 2018-09-19 21:31:26 Yes! Peppermint essential oil + panaway are GREAT especially together!
1031 2018-09-19 21:31:26 And oil/gas which is massively subsidized by us paying for the cost of being the world's "oil police"
1032 2018-09-19 21:31:20 What's the story with $EGC Energy XXI Gulf Coast? Cash deal on the table for $9.1/sh, being acquired by Cox Oil LLC. Trades near deal price. Closing pushed out a bit, so trades $2.5 lower. Cox Oil financing evaporate? #fundingsecured
1033 2018-09-19 21:31:06 Had the best pasta sauce of my life tonight. A classic Italian ragu. I can’t stop thinking about it. Probably 4 ingredients at most (tomatoes, onions, salt, olive oil) but it tasted like magic.
1034 2018-09-19 21:31:06 If you’re losing your hair, try neem oil. You have to either grow it or buy it fresh. There’s how-to videos online. There are also other methods. Just look into it! Because once you completely lose the hair, you can’t grow it back!
1035 2018-09-19 21:31:02 I swear if you don’t like me nor fuck with me don’t ask me about no chicken or oil Saturday on me lol

1050 2018-09-19 21:29:01 No se si has visto lo que han hecho las commodities los últimos 10 años. Tal vez el precio del oil y el gas ha tenido algo que ver. 
Los riesgos, q los fletes no suban, algo q es complicado fruto de las quiebras q ya está habiendo. La oferta se ha reducido, la demanda se mantiene
1051 2018-09-19 21:29:01 Hard to say for sure but the reason we have such inflation-phobia is actually mostly irrelevant to fiscal and monetary policy and has everything to do with a once in a lifetime oil embargo...which makes the whole thing even more bizarre
1052 2018-09-19 21:29:00 America now produces more oil than any country in the world.
1053 2018-09-19 21:28:57 Yang Garnier tu Micellar water oil infused ja sis, dia bukan Cleansing Oil. So dua-dua ni adalah produk yang berbeza

1063 2018-09-19 21:28:04 The more I read these comments, the more I want to rip my hair out. Everyone is missing the frickin' point. CBD oil does not give you a high. Kristen IS sober too! Things like this post from CBS is what's wrong with people. Educate yourselves, man 
1064 2018-09-19 21:27:59 Gabe has hurt this whole team.....Stop working Gabes coconut oil....this team blows...THEY BLOW. Gabe has done NOTHING right....he does not belong here. The ONLY reason he is here, is bc he is cheap, and Klentec is a moron.

1070 2018-09-19 21:26:29 Also Tartes Maracuja oil is nice for moisturizing but I wouldn’t use it every day. It also plumps your lips and you can use it on ur cuticles too!
1071 2018-09-19 21:26:16 Today I had a massive serving of souvla whole Greek frozen yogurt with olive oil and sea salt. Followed up by a scoop of salted malted cookie dough ice cream from salt & straw. I feel stronger for it and I have no regrets other than I should have gotten the ice cream in a cone
1072 2018-09-19 21:26:04 You have put gladness in my heart, more than when grain and wine and oil increase. I lie down in peace; at once I fall asleep; for only you, Lord, make me dwell in safety. —Psalm 4:7-8

1078 2018-09-19 21:25:13 I'm going to guess half of those 100k views are from TV's in sports bars and in waiting rooms of oil change places.
1079 2018-09-19 21:25:05 Gotta burn the midnight oil
1080 2018-09-19 21:24:51 This week on Emma eats like shit:
Boxed macaroni made with coconut oil and salad dressing as substitutes for butter. #Fuckmyarteries
1081 2018-09-19 21:24:49 so the oil cleansing would be before the witch hazel?
1082 2018-09-19 21:24:35 Agreed. Trees are part of the carbon cycle. They die then carbon becomes peat then coal/oil. The earth has been trapping carbon faster than it's been releasing it for millions of years.

In theory the carbon cycle could stop if all plants suffocate and nothing traps carbon again.
1083 2018-09-19 21:24:25 My CBD oil balm! It's absolutely amazing!!
1084 2018-09-19 21:24:22 Holy shit, Ethan, this looks like an oil painting for a fucking postcard! Subject be damned, you have some serious photography skills!
1085 2018-09-19 21:24:16 That's the thing: she IS sober. She uses CBD oil for her anxiety, which does not give you a high.
1086 2018-09-19 21:23:52 How about - Owning your minerals and having someone drill an oil well on your property!
1087 2018-09-19 21:23:38 GOD ANOINTS U(not puts any oil in u drippin out of any hands/this insanity to dupe beguile u only stop listening to satan's seed of evil )-2 Cor.2:21-Now he which stablished us with you in Christ and hath anointed us is God;-

1089 2018-09-19 21:23:29 Countries need to take a stand and ban the import of products grown on cleared rainforest land. If that means banning all palm oil from Malaysia and Indonesia and all soya and beef from Brazil then that’s what needs to be done.

1093 2018-09-19 21:22:57 The oil crisis was not caused by the EU or Common Market as it was then. Yes you are correct petrol coupons were issued, but never used.
1094 2018-09-19 21:22:51 Don't be so hard on Moore; he has a vested interest in the NDP proceeding w unreliable/unaffordable/inefficient renewables. Once @jkenney is in energy sources will be oil/nat gas again. Coal power sources will continue to come from Montana as NDP ideology destroyed that industry.
1095 2018-09-19 21:22:46 Smart!
1096 2018-09-19 21:22:41 @Fritolay Why do all your products use palm oil?
1097 2018-09-19 21:22:25 @Fritolay  what's up with destroying the environment and using palm oil frito-lay?
1098 2018-09-19 21:22:14 You’re already socialist in so many things. Social security, farm and oil subsidies, shared public services such as roads and infrastructure, tax abatements, state funded universities. All of these are forms of social welfare. Life is better for all because of them.
1099 2018-09-19 21:22:14 My face used to be fresh and acne free until...... I fell for the hype of coconut oil and my skin hasn’t remained the same. 
Only abroad weather + products can restore my skin to default setting.
1100 2018-09-19 21:22:09 Except for the whole, carrying an oil platform part. But it's still a big, big boat.
1101 2018-09-19 21:21:53 i know im getting old cuz i called the mechanic for this oil change after my calendar reminder told me to
1102 2018-09-19 21:21:49 I needa exfoliate and then soak my face in coconut oil cause my skin dry as FUK
1103 2018-09-19 21:21:43 IT GOT SOME OIL IN IT!! He said that 
1104 2018-09-19 21:21:27 You should be able to purchase our CBD oil from Irvine Acupuncture, you might want to give them a call first to make sure they are in stock.
1105 2018-09-19 21:21:22 How about sparks from trains transporting all that oil to the coast.  Pipelines are a proven safe reliable method of moving oil. In Europe the are orders of magnitude,  more ships safely moving oil every day.
1106 2018-09-19 21:21:08 Well, that's funny, because the Ottoman Empire tumbled after WWI ; it was dissolved on 1 November 1922. America had celebrated her what, 146th birthday by then? So that position doesn't hold. And America can keep her damn hands off everyone else's oil.
1107 2018-09-19 21:20:47 sudocrem does for teenage girls what tea tree oil does for grans
1108 2018-09-19 21:20:40 Which is why the US had to go to war with Iraq, because Hussein wanted to trade oil in euro's not dollars?
As the US was an importer of oil, printing dollars to buy oil would lead to inflation.
Does the magic money tree fail when you have to buy imports in another currency?
1109 2018-09-19 21:20:23 Oil... My initials
1110 2018-09-19 21:19:56 Yea I get you, the coconut oil is also great for her to eat too so if she licks it no worries :> I hope she feels better <3
1111 2018-09-19 21:19:34 Depends on when you served in the Military, where you served etc. And I’d argue joining the military for crap pay to defend poppy fields and oil interests of the 1% isn’t exactly brilliant.
1112 2018-09-19 21:19:31 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
1113 2018-09-19 21:18:59 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
1114 2018-09-19 21:18:58 2/2 the kind of oppression we're supposed to be freeing other ME nations of. Whenever the Taliban doesn't let girls go to school, we invade and call it "spreading Democracy". SA doesn't let women do anything without a male guardian, and we keep trading weapons and oil. Hypocrites
1115 2018-09-19 21:18:43 How embarrassing for oil city! I bet Adrian Durham somehow blames SPURS for it tomorrow! City's stadium was empty by the end, as all 7 supporters had fucked off 
1116 2018-09-19 21:18:30 Try cbd oil
1117 2018-09-19 21:18:24 @IsabellaCrush  Coconut oil...
1118 2018-09-19 21:18:23 Anyone have experience with treating anxiety using CBD oil?
1119 2018-09-19 21:18:17 I used to have really bad razor bumps. To the point where I thought it looked like herpes, and I was really self-conscious about it. But now, I spray witch hazel and Tea tree oil on them after I shower, and they’ve minimized so much.
1120 2018-09-19 21:18:08 If you are as broke as I am... Do not I repeat do not buy a BMW... The fat bitch will choke slam you on just an oil change... I’m crying though because I have to get rid of my foreign girl...
1121 2018-09-19 21:18:05 Anyways, brands I've used and liked are Oil of Olay, Neutrogena, Boots No. 7, and I switched to Trilogy this year, which I love. 

Most important is consistent use. Give products a month at least, unless you have a bad reaction in the first week, then stop using it.
1122 2018-09-19 21:17:57 Bush/Cheney, the oil companies never had it so good.
1123 2018-09-19 21:17:55 "How should you prepare the pork?"

"The pork is slimier than ever now ..." 

Gosh this is so stupid. But I'm laughing ... I love this game 
1124 2018-09-19 21:17:44 Siento que estoy sola
1125 2018-09-19 21:17:28 Still have to go get flour though  and something to put this oil in when I’m done frying
1126 2018-09-19 21:17:25 Chef McElroy cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with Silly Putty.
1127 2018-09-19 21:17:25 Interesting. Our fuel oil supplier Ultramar (Ottawa area) hasn't changed their price. Maybe the price reduction is from 1 October?
1128 2018-09-19 21:17:05 Hahaha I use no oil and high heat cos cba waiting

1131 2018-09-19 21:16:44 If she’s vaping CBD oil, she’s not getting “high” in front of anyone or by herself. That’s not the chemical that gets you “high”.
1132 2018-09-19 21:16:39 Low heat generally with a decent amount of oil normally Works for me
1133 2018-09-19 21:16:39 Thanks, still convinced Chavez was mostly responsible for the downfall of oil industry. It’s difficult to piece together info & get an accurate view of things. Just like w Zimbabwe there is no data to show how much sanctions hurt economy vs Mugabe’s actions
1134 2018-09-19 21:16:28 This oil pen been having me high af all day

         He only has a little holy oil left, and to get more he’d need to go to Jerusalem.

1137 2018-09-19 21:16:15 Your tax cuts haven't done squat!  The 2% extra I get per paycheck has been largely offset by higher gas/home heating oil prices and the now rising cost of goods because of your pissing match with China.......
1138 2018-09-19 21:16:10 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
1139 2018-09-19 21:16:01 Oil fields is the move 
1140 2018-09-19 21:16:00 Yes!

And the extremes photographers go to to make pics attractive, dry ice, baby oil, glycerine......boggling.
1141 2018-09-19 21:15:53 Vegetable oil, LMAO I mean who does that ? 
1142 2018-09-19 21:15:37 Sure he was. Why he was able to wring a charitable tax deductible contribution out of Olive Oil as his “penalty”. Joke
1143 2018-09-19 21:15:21 Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using massage oil while they fuck the ass
1144 2018-09-19 21:15:14 oops, just dropped oil on my shirt
1145 2018-09-19 21:15:05 anyone in the OC have any connections or links to gettin my hands on CBD oil? a place i can trust?
1146 2018-09-19 21:14:51 I’m just tryna rub oil on ya booty like the porn niggas do
1147 2018-09-19 21:14:19 Got out of work early enough to get an oil change, vacuum my car and also run it through the car wash 
1148 2018-09-19 21:14:16 Just made a steak I seasoned 3 days ago and forgot about in the fridge.  Put that medium heat on in the pan with some olive oil, garlic, and some butter on the steak.  Let that go for about 4-5 mins each side, wrap it in tin foil with some more butter and let it sit for 5.  GG!
1149 2018-09-19 21:14:01 I sunk an oil tanker
Off the shores of Galillee
1150 2018-09-19 21:14:00 What brought the idea of oil on canvas? That shit unique tho
1151 2018-09-19 21:13:54 I'm going to send you the recipe to the best squash soup I've ever made. No cream, just tons of garlic and day old bread and olive oil and it's perfect.
1152 2018-09-19 21:13:51 The inflation was part due to rising oil prices, but also due to rising wages. Unions were bargaining for higher wages to keep up with the rising cost of living – causing a wage-inflationary spiral. And with IMF rules imposed, Labour had no choice but to refuse pay rises.
1153 2018-09-19 21:13:50 Turkey doeant like sanction were putting on them cause of terorist elements disco mvered in their country. We cant technically be enemies with saudi Arabia cause of them being huge trading partners and their oil thats obvious. Syria is being destabilized by the EU AND RUSSIA.
1154 2018-09-19 21:13:19 Do you have any oil, lovely? Like even olive oil would help ease it
1155 2018-09-19 21:13:11 Any friends out there who could help me find a dispensary in Florida that is actually trained in helping find the best pain reliever, muscle spasms, depression. I’m 56, weed is not foreign to me. But vaping oil is. Thank you to anyone that is informed and willing to share.
1156 2018-09-19 21:13:09 Bro nah empty threat 
1157 2018-09-19 21:13:01 Alright, I get it. Have you tried using coconut oil before?
1158 2018-09-19 21:12:58 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
1159 2018-09-19 21:12:42 Shampoo tresmme merah + masker makarizo kiwi. Ga pake conditioner/vitamin tapi udah mantul sih, jadi lembut dan mudah diatur. Cuman aku lagi pengen nambah loreal yg extraordinary oil katanya ntar makin mantul.

1161 2018-09-19 21:12:38 @KristenDold Hi Kristen,  Good article on black seed oil you did for @VitaminShoppe  If you ever need a quote, I've investigated supplements for over 20 years.
1162 2018-09-19 21:12:22 Lobsters don’t have lungs, so they’re not breathing the smoke. Unless they put THC oil or something in the water so it was absorbed by the gills, it ain’t gonna do anything. Just a couple of peeps acting dumb.
1163 2018-09-19 21:12:09 So says #JerryBrown, who's family became RICH from oil due to his dad helping Indonesia's military dictator #Suarto and #Pertamina. LYING Jerry Brown.
1164 2018-09-19 21:12:02 I love oil cleansing!
1165 2018-09-19 21:11:58 Or is that palm oil?
1166 2018-09-19 21:11:57 in realtà panic oil era oil panic ma vabbe.. dopo più di trent'anni ci sta  comunque gli schiacciapensieri erano fighissimi

1170 2018-09-19 21:11:36 You live in a fantasy land. Nestle poisoned babies in Africa with bad formula. Union Carbide killed thousands in Bhopal. Oil companies regularly foul the environment. They are all still around. Nixon had to resign, as did Cameron etc etc. 
1171 2018-09-19 21:11:35 CBD oil does not give you a high.
1172 2018-09-19 21:11:25 Avacodo oil really fries too damn hard lmao

1187 2018-09-19 21:09:46 Don't waste your time trying to get lucky with crypto. Invest in something like oil/gold/energy, especially when the market is down.
1188 2018-09-19 21:09:36 So I put my deep conditioner in with some oil & left it out cause I was being lazy. Why is it day 2 & my hair looks amazing ?
1189 2018-09-19 21:09:33 My tia always setting me up with guys that work in the oil fields  them foos always out of town
1190 2018-09-19 21:09:32 This is how big oil took down our trolley systems. We’re gonna have to keep burning that gas or handover green energy to the obstructionists

1196 2018-09-19 21:08:48 So I know for sure I ain’t bringing my car here anymore for the oil change
1197 2018-09-19 21:08:11 I am right with you there- boil them in oil!

1205 2018-09-19 21:07:00 Some of us at BB HQ only wash our hair once a week! A good dry shampoo can work wonders. Also, training your hair to be washed only once a week makes it produce less oil!
1206 2018-09-19 21:06:59 Emergency brownies= brownies made with peanut butter,oil and water instead of egg. This could get interesting.
1207 2018-09-19 21:06:39 • Kristen uses CBD oil for her anxiety
• CBD oil does not give you a high
• You say Dax is "sober" - Kristen is sober too. Because again, no high.
• Knowledge is power, CBS
• Cool spin tho 
• Let them decide what is and isn't good for them
1208 2018-09-19 21:06:11 Beans and red oil.. 
Imagine people using vegetable oil to cook beans now. C'mon warra you doing..
1209 2018-09-19 21:06:07 Blah blah blah.. Try an oil spill clean up on an average winters day at sea. As a commercial diver i know full well we DO NOT have the tech to do this effectively. Spills dont happen when its flat calm...
1210 2018-09-19 21:06:04 I have a remedy .  Mine are at night.. Purchase a bottle of castor oil.. Rub it on each leg before going to bed.. It sounds awful... But it works.  I worked in the Medical field 25 years.. It works..
1211 2018-09-19 21:05:44 True, not all consumed fats are the same: Mono Unsaturated fats != saturated fats. Olive Oil != bacon grease. Fish oil != heavy whipping cream.
1212 2018-09-19 21:05:41 Guess you don't know a lot about business.

1228 2018-09-19 21:03:11 Put some salt, pepper, and olive oil on them. Wrap in plastic wrap and microwave for 7 minutes. You can spread them like butter!
1229 2018-09-19 21:02:47 We could always start by not funding foreign dictators and despots by purposely keeping our oil out of the global market. That would go a long way to stop thousands from dying.
1230 2018-09-19 21:02:47 What I have noticed with French football is that clubs with strong academies bounce back after losing a majority of their first team talent to the oligarch and corrupt oil regime clubs.

A lesson to the premiership no doubt.
1231 2018-09-19 21:02:22 ion need no oil or no oil filter tho
1232 2018-09-19 21:02:14 also, my handsome cousin Fekir scored to help Lyon beat those oil money dickheads City on the road today so Wednesday is going pretty well for me
1233 2018-09-19 21:02:01 91 black ass American dollars for an oil change and air filter. I’m bout to put on a fucking bow tie and sell fruit!
1234 2018-09-19 21:01:44 Good food but why a political statement with your artwork? Is a disgusting oil painting of Trump & Hillary in bed together necessary? While this remains in view, you can be sure our group will not return. Obviously Trump-supporters not welcome in your place.
1235 2018-09-19 21:01:29 Scrolling through FB I see a post about oil changes.
Scrolling through the comments I see a girl say her car got messed up because she didn’t know she had to get an oil change b/c “no one ever told her”

My day has been made 
1236 2018-09-19 21:01:25 Currently being forced to watch Guys Grocery Games in the waiting room while getting an oil change
1237 2018-09-19 21:01:13 Why do you say oil like that?
1238 2018-09-19 21:01:11 Also where the fuck are you going to find an old school oil lantern if there aren’t smokeshops there probably aren’t many hipsters/antique stores
1239 2018-09-19 21:01:07 How refreshing that passion and love overcame everything that is wrong with football......... before anyone replies, yes, I know @LFC have spent big but we have to try and compete with this oil money
1240 2018-09-19 21:01:01 This young lady who was trying to take my position for the ninth job in the building burped on the microphone and they removed it from her meaning I believe no one could get a job then she turns around and swallows the Indian hemp hair oil.

1256 2018-09-19 20:59:31 Saltless butter, ghee, or. Coconut oil are good too but you need to use a blender and it comes out like a capacino- bulletproof coffee.
1257 2018-09-19 20:59:31 I want to build battery and solar panel factories everywhere to move to EV.  Swiss banks and Big Oil are against me.  Meaning I am on your side.  We need to have a week long strike, no gas fill-ups, no Amazon purchases, no airline flights.  Hit them where it hurts.
1258 2018-09-19 20:59:30 If the govt got out of the way the issue would get worse not better.

Why do you think the oil industry has our country's best interests at heart.?

'We" don't import oil. The industry does. 

Stop being such a  tool
1259 2018-09-19 20:59:26 City disgracing England since Oil money intervention
1260 2018-09-19 20:59:05 I’m  at  Price Smart and a lady comes up to me and asked me to recommend the best type of olive oil. Olive  oil is three aisles away-  but she had me follow her to check them out and picked the one I suggested. Why me? I must look like a  pro
1261 2018-09-19 20:58:59 We'll be out of oil and energy way before it happens 
1262 2018-09-19 20:58:59 The oil price crash and the subsequent bankruptcies and mergers would have happened regardless of additional pipeline capacity. The resulting drying up private funding and movement to more profitable business also would have happened
1263 2018-09-19 20:58:55 The most senseless Tweet so far ....could that also be the reason why Npp evaporated 60000litere of oil ?
1264 2018-09-19 20:58:51 Why is it people think they deal with Addiction & Alcoholism on their own. How many people change the oil in their car by themselves? It's fatal and progressive, it affects everyone and everything around it. Reach out- It's the information age! #affetmorethan1 so many ways to try
1265 2018-09-19 20:58:39 Wow Azerbaijan what a great looking country, well the calital is. I mever even knew it produced oil  thanks to Joanna Lumley’s Silk Road documentary.
1266 2018-09-19 20:57:56 My order for CBD oil came in today! Can’t wait to get home to try it. I’m ready for some relief mannnnn.
1267 2018-09-19 20:57:55 Pure is the essential oil line of my company. But that deal tho... 
1268 2018-09-19 20:57:17 NO. It has mineral oil. Molecules aren't big enough to absorb so it makes you break out. Its purely a cult item. If you need suggestions for  products message me
1269 2018-09-19 20:57:11 It definitely has not killed my sex drive  But I haven't gotten laid in 8 months & I'm single so I don't need one right now anyway  other than the difficulty crying, it's great. But that's why I'm trying CBD oil now.
1270 2018-09-19 20:57:04 I found out by accident that I could customize an order on one of the self ordering kiosks. And instead of ordering two sausage egg McMuffin's and throwing away the bread. I could order one with the double egg double sausage and no cheese which is basically canola oil
1271 2018-09-19 20:57:00 "data is the new oil"...nice. #wyoming #wyotechsummit
1272 2018-09-19 20:57:00 Got new exfoliating body polish and my aloe plaaaaant and some tea tree oil. My skin is going to be radiant as fuck

1278 2018-09-19 20:56:39 So, he thinks bc a boat washes ashore in a storm it now has new owners. Well, I guess that goes along w/his thinking that we should have kept the Iraqi oil, doesn’t it? What an idiot!
1279 2018-09-19 20:56:39 No, it's entirely her. Did you even watch it? It's pathetic, she has make up on the wipe already, she has lash extensions so can't use oil anyway, and the pad never touches her.
1280 2018-09-19 20:56:28 It helps that they have tons of oil money and very few people. New York state has double the population of Sweden. These things don’t scale up either.
1281 2018-09-19 20:56:09 Headline doesn't specifies what kind of "crisis" will resolve.

Fixing two oil drills in Venezuela is fixing a crisis (given that we kinda have zero production)

Welcome to the relativity narrative.

1283 2018-09-19 20:55:49 Go get some cold pressed organic unrefined coconut oil and put a blob of that on her eye. I use that for my cats and the outside cats when their eye is irritated and red and it helps a lot.

1288 2018-09-19 20:54:38 How is that I bring my car in at 3:45 for an oil change and a guy that comes in at 4:30 gets his done BEFORE mine 
1289 2018-09-19 20:54:34 Steak and kidney pie with Mediterranean vegetables roster in olive oil. Oddly.

1292 2018-09-19 20:54:22 I’ve had oil, grease and lard. They don’t take the same and that’s okay
1293 2018-09-19 20:54:14 It’s oil for everything
1294 2018-09-19 20:53:58 Nah. I work at Enterprise Products. Midstream oil giant.

1298 2018-09-19 20:53:34 No dumbass...get anti-oil idiots like yourself and our government out of the way. No pipelines, a selective tanker ban and a carbon tax only on pipelines while we import foreign oil. Absolutely Stupidity.

1314 2018-09-19 20:51:56 Any actually proof that the fall in oil prices was all just designed to damage Venezuela? Anyway the problems were already in evidence before that. I would suggest that when you talk about doing research you try looking at sources other than just conspiracy theory sites.
1315 2018-09-19 20:51:52 I need an oil change
1316 2018-09-19 20:51:41 And oil prices rise

1318 2018-09-19 20:51:33 How many miles would your oil add to my car, it currently has 343,000.

1339 2018-09-19 20:49:03 Goes into our car no problem. Hard to clean cos the oil gets all over the spark plugs...but yeah less engine risk. Very bad design. Funnily enough, this sort of thing was. The kind of bad design was the. beginning of ergonomics in WWII. Killed pilots in those days.
1340 2018-09-19 20:48:55 There were talks the Chancellor would resume petrol tax increases in the next budget. Considering how petrol prices are already rising because of oil price and Sterling weakness, it may not be a great timing.
1341 2018-09-19 20:48:55 Just spent $760 today at the DMV, for tickets, tags, smog check, oil change, n a full tank of gas 

Then ima drop another $150 to tint my windows

and then another $500 to pay the deductible to get my car fixed

Then $250 for a new stereo system

I just love wasting money.

1345 2018-09-19 20:47:42 Uh Mr. Secretary, I think your Twitter account has been hacked. It's saying stuff you clearly do not believe or behave in a manner consistent with.

1349 2018-09-19 20:47:13 Also, all storm drains drain into the gulf on the FL west coast carrying runoff from dirty oil drenched parking lots. Rainwater flows from pond to canal to gulf without filtering. Just watch what happens when it storms. It is a shame.

1351 2018-09-19 20:46:59 I am confused. Animals eat and emit carbon. That should not increase atmospheric carbon, should it? I get the oil to run farm machinery. Does that plus maybe churning up the soil amount to 14%? What if all animals were fed by naturally growing plants (e.g., free-range beef)?
1352 2018-09-19 20:46:53 Went to get my oil changed & 5 min later my mom comes walking in to get her inspection done like what are the odds we show up at the same time

1355 2018-09-19 20:46:20 Hopefully, everything works out with Venezuela and Maduro is remove. That country should be nowhere near its current situation given its oil wealth.

1398 2018-09-19 20:39:06 You could also sub the green beans for asparagus. drizzle/mix with a lil olive oil with a coarse salt and cracked pepper, then broil them on hi for about 8 minutes. tender and tasty.
1399 2018-09-19 20:39:03 I see you see the undeniability of my point. I don't see oil as blood, I see blood as blood.

1426 2018-09-19 20:35:41 If you're out of shaving cream, use olive oil. It works just as good, if not better.

Canadian marijuana market, man. (CBD oil is 3x bigger at least than the market for THC. There's a HUGE amount of money flowing into this industry right now in advance of legalization.)
1428 2018-09-19 20:35:25 20 x 20 air filter on 20 x 20 box fan. Could be surprised how much gets missed even by expensive air purifiers. I also use essential oil diffuser.

1432 2018-09-19 20:35:06 As always feel free to experiment w different flavors. I’ve used truffle oil before and it’s a fantastic addition

A eso estuvo el OIL en esa época
1434 2018-09-19 20:35:01 These boujee autoshops are a dub. They take forever for no reason. Bih why have i been waiting for about an hour for a damn oil change
1435 2018-09-19 20:35:00 Fish oil you can find... I had to order the vitamins online though... they're not very common.  Worth it though.. I haven't woken up with back pain or walked with a limp in a long time now.
Of course, don't take my word for it though.. do some research first and you'll see :)
1436 2018-09-19 20:34:52 I’ve stopped trading oil. I’ll wait for it to hit 83-85, after which I will short it.
1437 2018-09-19 20:34:45 I told you to get some fuckin castor oil tht shit works
1438 2018-09-19 20:34:44 between the top 8 meat and dairy companies and the top 3 oil companies, almost 2,600 million tons of greenhouse gasses were produced in one year alone. This number increases every year. You're trying to tell me that has nothing to do with global warming?
1439 2018-09-19 20:34:43 Came to get a oil change and this grown man just stalled my car  not even my girl stalls my car  smh

1441 2018-09-19 20:34:07 Never trust that "friend" who would reveal your confidential matter over an argument.
He's like the paper wrap of a suya, there's no hiding place for the oil.

1447 2018-09-19 20:33:08 Who said anything about oil? I made a clear undeniable point. Lemme make it again. The countries that are considered peak socialist currently, exist on a bedrock of past exploitation and blood & are sustained by high taxes. Find me ONE that has made it without that background.
1448 2018-09-19 20:32:55 gonna start titling my work with emojis.... , oil on canvas, 2018
1449 2018-09-19 20:32:50 - Prepare vegetables by dicing them.  heat stock pot w/ enough olive oil to cover the bottom. Once hot, sauté garlic and shallots for about 30-45 seconds. Add in onions and sweat for about 3-4 minutes or until they begin to brown.
1450 2018-09-19 20:32:45 Literally if I dont wash my face for an entire day, my makeup will melt off my face with the oil and I'll look like a complete fucking mess 

I legit am tired of having acne
1451 2018-09-19 20:32:35 People don’t talk enough about how great broccoli is. Go home and roast some broccoli tonight at 425 with plenty of olive oil and salt for like 15-20 minutes. You’ll be so happy.

AVURA coy.

AVURA Oil
AVURA  Energy
AVURA Concept et all

My thought.
1455 2018-09-19 20:32:18 Apparently Trump has the best words. What do you expect from a snake oil salesman?
1456 2018-09-19 20:32:16 I don’t even know, but every time I eat it my stomach hurts so bad! I don’t have that problem anywhere else I go. I think it’s the oil or whatever they use to cook the food.
1457 2018-09-19 20:32:11 Me and caffeine is like water and oil. We just don’t mix!

1465 2018-09-19 20:30:45 The US sets the terms of global trade, the dollar is the global reserve currency which artificially inflates the demand for dollars and increases its value (saudi and russia accept payment for oil in dollars), the US pressures countries into favorable economic deals regularly
1466 2018-09-19 20:30:34 Oil and hot sauce
1467 2018-09-19 20:30:32 I dig sesame oil!
1468 2018-09-19 20:30:30 You can't compare a 55-100k car with a Ferrari. Few get the top optioned trim. Billions of barrels of oil have been saved, and self driving tech has been given a shot in the arm. The S/X financed the 3,which more people can actually afford now.

1474 2018-09-19 20:29:20 This is all very good but the MSM tv news ran the IMF comments every 15 mins and interview several remainers to oil the wheels, yet we don’t hear a peep about how wrong they are. Remainers have got the impact they needed without  correction or serious challenge.

1480 2018-09-19 20:28:41 Try 2000-4000mg of fish oil and 100-200mcg of Vitamin K2-mk7 a day for a couple months.  I've got some nasty joint issues as well and now I have almost no pain.  Vitamin K2-mk7 has been shown to regenerate bones after necrosis... It's a slow process, but so far it works for me :)
1481 2018-09-19 20:28:41 Can any of you Nigerian's explain to me how @VillageParrot thinks Nijia can take over anything. Let alone the US when they had to rely on the Chinese to build an oil refinery so Nigeria could BEGIN to benefit from there own oil reserves. Explain please! Someone!
1482 2018-09-19 20:28:25 He's totally a scammer. Is he an engineer or anything with oil? I just called one of them out today and shockingly he immediately unmatched me. Also from the Netherlands and in Africa for a couple of weeks. I've also had them say they're from Germany or Denmark.

1486 2018-09-19 20:27:42 Tea tree oil and daily exfoliation. 
Aloe Vera plant and honey also does the works.  
I’ll do that every blue moon but daily exfoliation works for me. Also invest in an oil. I use vitamin E after the shower.
1487 2018-09-19 20:27:38 i walked the crik basin 400 miles to duncarin dam one janurary. just a oil sludge stained skidoo suit, pack of smokes, used clothes luggage and a quilt granny made me for grad. i made it and was taken in by several to eat then. took 3 days with foibles on the way

1491 2018-09-19 20:26:12 Do the Conservatives have numbers to back-up their claim? Short-term? Long-term? We need numbers. If oil is such a poor investment, then please invest massively into sustainable renewable clean green energies. We all want it. But oil is still par of the mix for now.

1498 2018-09-19 20:25:29 #Oil: "The industry has profited from the manufacture of fossil fuels but has not had to absorb the economic costs of the consequences. The industry had the science 30 years ago and knew what was going to happen but made no warning so that preemptive steps could have been taken."
1499 2018-09-19 20:25:13 AFFECTED:  "Affected" means "impacted, created an effect on, changed in a certain way." "Effected" means "executed, brought about, produced something." Example The BP oil spill adversely affected marine wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico and surrounding areas.

1501 2018-09-19 20:25:10 Bought my car to @girlsautoclinic to get an oil change. Been wanting to patronize them for a while now. Excellent service and an extremely comfortable waiting area with Netflix, snacks and WiFi.
1502 2018-09-19 20:24:59 My piercer told me today that I don't have to bother with the tea tree oil as much anymore... but I've gotten so used to the smell and the burn now... I might just keep it up.
1503 2018-09-19 20:24:57 Zinke ... you gut pollution protections on Big Gas & Oil that are destroy our Public Lands, Parks & Monuments all the while Trump is going to put biodefense plans together to protect Americans.

1512 2018-09-19 20:24:05 Olive oil. It’s nice and slippery. Also tastes great.
1513 2018-09-19 20:23:57 Saw a review for the oil paints I was looking at and the reason it only has three stars is because people keep having one consistent problem: 

They're stupid. 

They complain that the oil paint doesn't dry fast....Just stick to your "Basic" brand of paint Carol
1514 2018-09-19 20:23:41 I got one that’s for the cartridges with weed oil in them, I get screw on cartridges tho but I think for vaping you just get different oils and shit but you keep the same cartridge
1515 2018-09-19 20:23:38 Got a girl that came into the shop talking bout her car stopping when it takes off. I get in immediately see the sticker for her routine oil change it says due at "3750mi". The mileage on the car is 26,371 mi. This lady hasn't got a oil change in 23,000 miles breh.
1516 2018-09-19 20:23:31 Who says miracles don’t happen these days? According to the Christian mythology Jesus Christ (A.S) looked in the river and it turned into wine. The other day the Sindh Forensic Lab just turned whisky and Vodka into honey and olive oil even without any ado.

1523 2018-09-19 20:22:43 So happy to come out of the tea tree oil closet after slightly more than half of you guys confirmed that it does indeed smell fresh and amazing.
1524 2018-09-19 20:22:43 Went for an “oil change” and they done talked me into getting an air filter AND new wipers.. smh idk how to say no 
1525 2018-09-19 20:22:41 I’m for a clean environment and everyone’s right to free speech. The hypocrisy on oil is just outstanding.
1526 2018-09-19 20:22:37 @beautybakerie i love my cake mix foundation, but I'm having issues with it just not blended right on my right cheek. Would the oil help that? Would it aggravate cystic acne?

1533 2018-09-19 20:21:18 Don't threatened @POTUS .   @JerryBrownGov  Btw drilling for oil on or off shore does not affect climate change. Note the USA led the world in Co2 reductions, we do not need to give the Paris accord $10 bil. A year.  Launch your own damn rocket but build ur own launch platform.

1544 2018-09-19 20:19:35 I hope everyone that disputes the current necessity of oil and gas doesn’t use it or any of its bi products, in any way. Please don’t use your car, bicycle, shoes, clothing, or plastic kayaks to get around. Please don’t use natural gas or electricity as well

1548 2018-09-19 20:18:58 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
1549 2018-09-19 20:18:51 Oil leaking.  Great.
1550 2018-09-19 20:18:40 Sardines in oil, and a velvet throw that she's already "throw"n up on twice.

1552 2018-09-19 20:18:20 “I’ve already told you, I’m very busy—”
“Odasaku, I have a method to free him from his busyness. As long as we hug him from both sides and smear our stench, sludge, and oil onto him furiously, scientifically, he won’t be able to continue working for today!”
“I see.”
1553 2018-09-19 20:18:16 Irish libel laws are atrocious. So had to take down a previously untouchable blog bout the geezer, pay 50  lids to the Poor Clares with their history of child abuse n promise not engage with snake oil merchants.
1554 2018-09-19 20:18:15 A dab is a hit of hash oil vapor through a borosilicate glass pipe, not a millennial dance move, in case you were not clear...
1555 2018-09-19 20:18:13 You'll know when Save Our Dolts was there when the 78 Corollas were leaking oil all over the lot @overusedrighty @Joosef
1556 2018-09-19 20:18:02 It’s once again the time of year for me to douse myself in eucalyptus oil almost as though it’s my favourite perfume.

1559 2018-09-19 20:17:55 It'd be great if y'all would talk about some of the crude (oil!) trading lingo used in tweets. Sometimes I don't understand the significance of what's said because I'm not in on the shorthand.  :-D
1560 2018-09-19 20:17:54 Do you take something for Omega 3s? I'd love to take a vegan "fish oil" it's just so damn expensive. Love beyond burgers! Have you had the Field roast hot dogs?
1561 2018-09-19 20:17:53 cool, let me burn midnight oil :popular:
1562 2018-09-19 20:17:52 The UCP says that they are concerned teachers tell kids oil & gas are destroying the planet. In other words, they expect teachers to lie.  The UCP propaganda curriculum will be the envy of Joseph Goebbels.
1563 2018-09-19 20:17:47 I check all the food I buy and products and if any has palm oil I leave it, do not buy it. Seen documents about what us getting palm oil does to the rain forest and it frightened me. The best was from a French documentary show which is called #FíorScéal in Ireland (true story)
1564 2018-09-19 20:17:31 Vote Red in November to save America from a socialist left!!!
1565 2018-09-19 20:17:27 The answer is really easy - last 2-3 years Venezuela basically lives on russian federal budget (on our taxes)-in exchange Maduro transferred all oil industry to Putin's control companies, which is worthless. And now financial support ended - there's no money in Russia for itself.
1566 2018-09-19 20:17:18 So many benefits from our CBD OIL and people are coming off prescription meds 
1567 2018-09-19 20:17:02 I hate any plastic of any kind that is used in food packaging. Let's see how it was done 30 years ago, before we were flooded with this oil derived plague. I use stainless steel flask for my tea, stainless steel lunch box for my sandwiches. Lazy people destroy the Earth.
1568 2018-09-19 20:16:51 WOW!!!WOW!!!WOW!!!WOW!!!!

1577 2018-09-19 20:16:02 Lisa Murkoski will not vote against Kavanaugh because because Alaska is ready to move into big oil. They will,and already have move in to the wildlife refuge. So yes for Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan. Trump has done it again.@CNNPolitics
1578 2018-09-19 20:16:01 The oil was gonna have a loss no matter who owned it. Venezuela having that as its chief export is a flaw of international trade.
1579 2018-09-19 20:15:51 Absolutely Ben. I was shocked to find out recently that a large oil sands pure play makes it onto several high profile ESG indices #greenwash
1580 2018-09-19 20:15:50 UK balance of payments for its debt underwritten by Scottish oil, whisky and food exports say otherwise, and that's before we charge for Faslane nukes rental and our energy exports to rUK.

We have a positive balance of trade, unlike the rest of the UK.

1584 2018-09-19 20:15:03 Starting in 2014, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap oil. This is not a mere business decision, but a calculated move coordinated with U.S. and Israeli foreign policy goals.
1585 2018-09-19 20:14:57 He changes what he says to fit his audience. For example, he has said on more than one occasion that he wants to stop legal immigration but denied it during the interview. He is less of an ideologist & more snake oil salesman.
1586 2018-09-19 20:14:45 Might want to check the oil while you're at it...
1587 2018-09-19 20:14:42 Use Jamaican black castor oil it works 100% and it doesn’t have much of a smell just rub a little bit on your head and massage it in your scalp for 3-5 min 2xs a week but massage ur scalp every single day 3-5 min improves blood circulation for healthy hair growth
1588 2018-09-19 20:14:36 Does it? I'm not an American so I don't know the details.

I know it's nothing compared to socialist countries like Venezuela where the government loots General Motors factories and nationalizes the oil turning in a loss.
1589 2018-09-19 20:14:27 if we waited for oil companies or government to make a move on this then it wouldn't happen in the first place. grassroots movements are the only way we can force their hand, and sidestep the money / PR trap used to stall and prevent action on climate #DIVEST 
1590 2018-09-19 20:14:22 i’m sick, my car is leaking oil af, and i’ve got a test in psych it’s time to die
1591 2018-09-19 20:14:14 I eat a TON of tofu, some beyond burgers, tempeh and some veggie dogs, and some of the vegan Gardein products. 

I don't really use honey, nothing with fish oil and I try with the alcohol.

1598 2018-09-19 20:13:18 Had another stab at chankonabe. Used six packets of instant miso as the base and a couple of vegetable stock cubes as things reduced. Bit of sesame oil in there, too. Not bad. Going to order some supplies for a proper recipe. #gymlife
1599 2018-09-19 20:13:14 You know what Brad? American style coservatism and big oil are just what Canada needs about now.
1600 2018-09-19 20:13:12 Difference between, "I discussed my appearance about the oil industry with my grade-school friend who's a stay-at-home dad" and "I discussed my appearance about oil only with an oil-industry lobbyist (or only environmentalist lobbyist)." (2/2)

1602 2018-09-19 20:12:57 Want some balsamic vinegar in olive oil n’ some beaut bread to dip in it.
1603 2018-09-19 20:12:40 The only difference was I used an air fryer instead of oil, no cheese sauce, and used Mexican crema instead of sour cream. It’s just a little more runny.
1604 2018-09-19 20:12:33 Baked eggs are great, fry them up with some seasoning, garlic and a little oil and then add to a small oven dish with the cooking oil. Crack 4 eggs into the dish and sprinkle with salt pepper and paprika or cayenne pepper. Cook for 5 mins at around 180c
1605 2018-09-19 20:12:25 If I use a beard oil and my shit fall out. I'm fighting. Everybody on my way to killing the supplier. Deadass.
1606 2018-09-19 20:12:24 In order for president Maduro to survive, he has to do one of these two things : 
1. Get ride of the Venezuela Oil
2. Get ride of the rebels or Lucifer mercenaries.
Which one seems  more unlikely ?
There will be war
1607 2018-09-19 20:12:18 I have a Neck Oil & a Smog Rocket check in from 26 April 2012.....

1609 2018-09-19 20:12:13 Have you ever barbecued beefsteak tomatos with a lil olive oil and herbs??? Mmmmm
1610 2018-09-19 20:12:11 the current scandal with poisoning a very big owner of news portal in Russia was made with high doses. Putin and his state killers in KGB like to use scopolamine many years, when he taken away an oil company Ukos - they drugged all arrested former "owners", which almost survive.

1612 2018-09-19 20:11:56 a moment of silence bc i just dabbed the last of my oil 
1613 2018-09-19 20:11:40 Seriously. On the Matthews quote about Buffalo. I get asked why teen pregnancy is so high in my shithole city. These kids don't have anything else to do. They ride oil derricks like mechanical bulls for fucks sake.
1614 2018-09-19 20:11:33 I've become an Oil of Olay fan. Just recently realized it was time to switch from Total Effects to Regenerist. Pimples haven't been a problem for a while... 
1615 2018-09-19 20:11:31 Idk if this is helpful but I eat better when I'm not eating as many meat/cheese substitutes. Like I'll go without a fake meat and feel better about how I eat. Having said that I consume honey, fish oil and don't look into the type of alcohol I drink. Lol idk if that's helpful.
1616 2018-09-19 20:11:26 i already don’t feel like getting this oil change tomorrow 
1617 2018-09-19 20:11:13 So just realised I can’t take my make up remover on the plane with me since it’s hemp oil...GREAT

1623 2018-09-19 20:10:03 You can't beat oven roasted with a drizzle of oil and some garlic, they go all sweet and then taste delicious stirred through some pasta with chicken, soft cheese and a small amount of sweet chilli sauce. My favourite lunch.
1624 2018-09-19 20:09:54 I got a oil change and a tune up today my car feels new 
1625 2018-09-19 20:09:44 Emptihad ,booing at half time ,loads of empty seats ,no atmosphere for the " sell out crowd."..get some more oil  money pumped in..
1626 2018-09-19 20:09:33 You have a point Dax.  I'm glad you were strong enough to be around it and still stay sober. I take CBD oil but won't do the marijuana.

1629 2018-09-19 20:09:18 My skin is extremely clear and I am ON MY PERIOD and I can’t decide if it’s because I’m drinking 3 liters of water a day or because I switched all my products to have rose in them (rose infused witch hazel, rose water, rosehip oil, also my makeup remover has rose too)

1632 2018-09-19 20:08:45 Who called it “that miasma of puke and urine and sewage and stale booze in the street downtown” and not “CBD oil”?
1633 2018-09-19 20:08:35 In this case you're the complainant because you're accusing the north of bn favored during entry exams into unity schools, presenting your illogical allegations, then I asked you to prove with an evidence from the board n u presented a faceless typing.

1637 2018-09-19 20:07:16 In the 2018 budget, the Akufo-Addo government presented to Parliament a benchmark price  which is the price at which we sell our oil of $57 per barrel. But as we speak now, the price per barrel is $77 per barrel - Adam Mutawakilu  #CitiNewsroom

1642 2018-09-19 20:06:30 She's very open in her battles with depression and anxiety. She's vaping CBD oil for its medical purpose. The tweet is misleading and assumes CBD oil is the same as getting high off weed. She isn't being self centered and Dax supports and encourages her in this.
1643 2018-09-19 20:06:26 Bravo... we need more refineries to produce oil that can be sold at a much lower discount. We do not need an TMX extension. Why does Ontario purchase all its oil from the USA and the Eastern Provinces from far away places like Saudi???

1647 2018-09-19 20:06:19 The article at the start of this thread is about a boost in oil & gas sales in the last year 2017/18, again nothing to do with oil reserves. You really should read things properly before tweeting. It really makes you look rather stupid. 
So my dear chap "You were wrong"!!!
1648 2018-09-19 20:06:05 Memphis and Fekir ripping apart oil money FC? Who would’ve thought the day would come when united and Liverpool link up this well.
1649 2018-09-19 20:05:51 How does it take 45 minutes to change oil? Make that make sense to me lol.

1653 2018-09-19 20:04:37 Yes a melting pot of abusing free work force(slavery)land that u took by force from the natives the oil u took by manipulation and force from east, a lot of asian talent of the the asian immigrants you sold the idea of American Dream to and all the resources you stole from Africa
1654 2018-09-19 20:04:22 My life would be so much easier if I could actually see properly spending my life looking at things like a blurry oil painting
1655 2018-09-19 20:04:15 I like Jon Pertwee too. Particularly _The Green Death_, where the Doctor throws his lot in with an alternative ecologically-minded community in opposing an oil multinational. PC?

1656 2018-09-19 20:04:11 idk! it uses coconut oil already tho
1657 2018-09-19 20:04:09 I wash my face with witch hazel, and I moisturize with olive oil. (Thanks Nestor, for that recommendation, wherever you are lol). Used to use a regular face wash and cosmetic moisturizer. This works way better, if I do it the right amount.

1669 2018-09-19 20:03:14 I said yes because too many lazy voters do not do their research on candidates.  We were bound to get something this bad eventually.  Maybe now people will do their homework before they vote for the next snake oil salesman who comes down the pike.
1670 2018-09-19 20:03:08 Hey, @Injustice, appreciate the RT!
It is shameful that the poor of this country continue to suffer from environmental injustice, whether it be malignant public drinking water in Flint or pollution from the oil refineries where they live in Texas.

1672 2018-09-19 20:02:47 Does she vape weed or CBD oil? Either way if it’s what works for them, then that’s cool. But I believe there’s a difference in the 2 and know a lot of people that use CBD for anxiety and to help them sleep.
1673 2018-09-19 20:02:46 I don't have enough oil in my lamp for this
1674 2018-09-19 20:02:41 Is stopping oil production in CA realistic? When someone works on climate issues as he has and still gets mocking cardboard cutouts made, that seems more discouraging than galvanizing
 What would a more incremental step even look like?

1680 2018-09-19 20:02:22 #MMIW I believe any pipeline/oil workers/military personnel located near Indigenous lands in the U.S. & Canada should have DNA taken to prevent any type of crimes against Indigenous women. There are approximately 5000 unsolved cases!

1682 2018-09-19 20:02:09 Wrong. We are to big, too rich and too smart to ever vote for indy. 

The SNP White Paper has been shot down and all of the responses of ‘scaremongering’ that Salmond offered has been debunked by oil price crash and by the SNP SGC.
1683 2018-09-19 20:02:03 Trump, who wants Afghanistan's minerals and Iraq's oil, slams the president who would give Trump's cronies the opportunities to take them...
1684 2018-09-19 20:02:01 Yes... we need more refineries to produce oil that can be sold at a much lower discount. We do not need an TMX extension. Why does Ontario purchase all its oil from the USA and the Eastern Provinces from far away places like Saudi???

1687 2018-09-19 20:01:47 Have y’all heard of blackseed oil?
1688 2018-09-19 20:01:47 £200m a year...
Compare that with the average cost per year (2014-2016) of subsidising coal, oil and gas production: £693m.

Air pollution kills about 30,000 people a year in the UK.
1689 2018-09-19 20:01:46 I like how all the big oil rich clubs typically do disproportionately bad in Europe. City, PSG and for a long time, Chelsea.
1690 2018-09-19 20:01:36 You can customize the oil to his hair needs.
1691 2018-09-19 20:01:20 Oh for sure....and luckily I like Vinegar so it’s kind of enjoyable lol....just need to work on the consistency. I’ll do good for a while and then miss a few days

1700 2018-09-19 19:59:27 The Biggest Risk In Today’s Oil Markets

1711 2018-09-19 19:58:07 All you need is some grilled chicken.  Saute the kale with some garlic & olive oil (red pepper flakes if you're feeling adventurous).  Boil the potatoes and sprinkle with parsley and lemon butter.
1712 2018-09-19 19:58:04 I am tending to believe that ONLY David was ever anointed, anointed with oil, told he would be king of Israel; in other words, the apostles were chosen, but were they EVER anointed, or anyone else for that  matter?

Please provide Scripture/s in support of any other view.
1713 2018-09-19 19:58:03 You love putting words in other peoples mouth, huh?

There is no problem with reliability, just y’all trying to manufacture an issue so you can stop renewables from taking money out of the pockets of your oil/gas donors

1734 2018-09-19 19:55:24 Eeeh. We were in and out of each others' houses all day long. Aye, we had polio but no-one complained. In them days of course olive oil was something you got from the chemist to put in your ears.

Regardless of wealth being created or not, people get sick and people gotta eat.

1. Health/food/agriculture are basic industries that allow for the manpower needed to create wealth in the first place

2. The health and food industries existed way before oil extraction

1759 2018-09-19 19:52:39 Through all the excise duty thing it's been interesting how little has been talked about the fact that fuel prices would be lower if we actually had an operational refinery especially as an oil 'exporter'. The cut in transport cost could make some dents.

1771 2018-09-19 19:50:41 I think if you believe that Oil should be deregulated even if it kills people through these climate change disasters that you shouldn’t be regulating women’s reproductive rights..Would you like women regulating your body? I think not

1774 2018-09-19 19:50:20 I would not want to eat with that thing around. Imagine trying to eat while it oozes Trump all over the restaurant. With all that oil oozing out of it I bet it stinks as well.

1779 2018-09-19 19:49:37 400% more oil is exported than imported. 

What you are angry at is free market capitalism that exports in one place and imports in another. The industry imports oil because they are the ones lacking ethics. 

Stop being such a massive tool for the oil industry.
1780 2018-09-19 19:49:19 The refiners are all selling off today, esp Holly Frontier.  Seems like an over reaction to something but I can only think it is the slow rise in oil.  May be an oppurtunity.

1812 2018-09-19 19:45:13 Yes. We do freeze it. It doesn't seem to matter. It is just as good as it is first baked. We use fresh yeast, and organic flour. In our rolls and bloomers we add some rapeseed oil. In the focaccia olive oil.
1813 2018-09-19 19:45:08 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1814 2018-09-19 19:45:04 i dont think im there yet. im running low on oil so im just saving up till then
1815 2018-09-19 19:45:01 I’ve been at this @jiffylube for TWO HOURS just trying to get an oil change ..... what the hell man
1816 2018-09-19 19:44:48 $CVE WTI loved that EIA drop and so did the oil stocks. Longevity? Who the F knows!
1817 2018-09-19 19:44:36 Its the Palm Oil......
1818 2018-09-19 19:44:21 But all will be forgiven I'd they call it snake oil and it's all for cosmetics...
1819 2018-09-19 19:44:18 "The craziest and craziest things in the world cannot be fondled or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
1820 2018-09-19 19:43:53 For the first time since 1973, the United States is the world's largest producer of crude oil, according to preliminary estimates published on Wednesday by the Energy Department. This has created thousands of jobs
1821 2018-09-19 19:43:52 I get so lazy to do my oil change like fuck why can’t it do it itself
1822 2018-09-19 19:43:50 SATURDAY • 9.22 | #HTownSHOWDOWN #TSU vs. #UH  “Battle of 3rd Ward” | The “SET OWT” @ 3p...Kickoff @ 7p @ TDECU Stadium (UH). Good Food + Good Music + Good OIL!! #EAT #DRINK #BeOWT (stadium/tailgate map - swipe left) @ TDECU Stadium
1823 2018-09-19 19:43:45 The Witcher:
It was a windy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about  White Wolfs. 'Use  Beast Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
1824 2018-09-19 19:43:39 i just paid $85 for an oil change, what the fuck
1825 2018-09-19 19:43:29 Have u tried hot oil treatment with jojoba oil. That oil also works wonders.
1826 2018-09-19 19:43:23 Yet the same department sold oil reserves and such
1827 2018-09-19 19:43:23 hey! the waitress just let me know that the miso-grilled aubergine that’s marked (v) is fried with the same oil and utensils as the meat. if this is right it shouldn’t be marked as vegetarian plzzzz
1828 2018-09-19 19:43:16 I make a salmon on the oven that's always a hit. In advance I season it with lemon and orange juice, salt, garlic powder and a sprinkle of dill and some olive oil. Later I put it in the oven and let it get cooked and with a little brown colour.
1829 2018-09-19 19:43:08 Palm oil=extinction
1830 2018-09-19 19:43:02 One of the many misconceptions about malaria...... Some even say too much consumption of red oil causes malaria #Alllies
1831 2018-09-19 19:42:46 Did yu use sesame seed oil Nd soy sauce 
1832 2018-09-19 19:42:45 By using them as keynote speakers how can it not? Neither have anything to offer besides their rants against the oil/gas industry. Both receive money/direction from foreign engos such as Tides, @350, etc. For ATA to disavow their influence is disingenuous at best.
1833 2018-09-19 19:42:38 Announcement.. Announcement!!!  I have gone this entire day with NO rest breaks!  Thanks you CBD oil.  I believe.. I BELIEVE!! 
1834 2018-09-19 19:42:33 Yep! And it’s no coincidence that the Iran sanctions are pushing up oil prices much to Puppet Master Putin’s delight !!
1835 2018-09-19 19:42:17 Agreed, but we should also eliminate the massive subsidies the oil industry gets via us being the world's "oil police", with our massively expensive military.
1836 2018-09-19 19:42:11 got a new wallet and purse, my @trophyeyesmusic sweater came, for an oil change and my car doesn’t sound like trash anymore, and my bank account isn’t empty for the first time in a while. it’s a good day
1837 2018-09-19 19:42:05 @Tesco soybean oil in the @bluedragon_uk pad Thai noodle kit on online groceries needs highlighting. Whoops!
1838 2018-09-19 19:41:58 Is it a Benjamin BPBD3S?
1839 2018-09-19 19:41:45 Maybeline Super Stay Matte Ink. 
No transfer. Need oil based make-up remover to take off
1840 2018-09-19 19:41:32 From the oil companies? "The funding is being provided by Husky Energy and partners in the West White Rose project and will be used to attract investment, increase supply sector opportunities and reduce the cost of development." - Maybe the NL gov is a partner?
1841 2018-09-19 19:41:30 Ever wonder why Norway who has harvested less oil then Canada has $1 Trillion in the bank while Canada has a $600 billion debt + provincial debts. That’s what the Cons and Libs have delivered. We need the Greens more then ever in this country, that is if we want some balance.
1842 2018-09-19 19:41:26 Dear @bukolasaraki sir. Will you be growing the Nigeria Maritime Industry if elected President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2019? $50Billion Industry with 1.5Milion job potential? 42 sectors under this industry alone, second only to Oil & Gas in earning potentials?
1843 2018-09-19 19:41:19 Oil changes take forever 
1844 2018-09-19 19:41:01 "Robots will steal your job" is a titillating headline but will likely not happen (or take 35 years). Boring but more probable is the decline of oil industry and truck maintenance services caused by switching to battery-electric vehicles.
1845 2018-09-19 19:40:44 They'll determine price,and which grade is good enough for the market once it goes global; cos we're here being late for the party. Who the hell we waiting for? Medicine,fuel,paper,fabrics,oil,wood,jobs, etc. #FreeTheTree_Gh #LegalizeIt
1846 2018-09-19 19:40:44 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
1847 2018-09-19 19:40:34 1/2 Oil and gas isnt productive energy many countries going green energy. The island only has couple of areas not worth money to drill or flush out! Sure pollution tankers and waste locals and tourists wouldnt like.
1848 2018-09-19 19:40:20 I've seen those in .357 before. Didn't the made a .45, but of course they do. Now maybe I need to divert some funds that way...
1849 2018-09-19 19:40:18 Similarly, Spanish recipes use so much olive oil that it appears on the list twice! (Conversely, what Mexican dishes require olive oil? I've lived near the border for most of my adult life, and learned from some excellent local cooks... I've *never* seen OO in a recipe???)
1850 2018-09-19 19:40:10 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
1851 2018-09-19 19:40:06 There is no list available of banned oils. The ban applies to any type of oil that has undergone partial hydrogenation, a process that turns liquid oil into a semi-solid form. Use the Nutrition Facts table on the food label to choose foods with little or no trans fat.
1852 2018-09-19 19:40:05 Family Nutrition: #Pringles Cheddar Cheese this September? With less than 2% actual Cheddar Cheese, it has more salt, oil or MSG!
1853 2018-09-19 19:39:52 The update cover photo is called: The Cactus - 120 x 72 inches - oil on canvas. It is so large that only a portion of the painting is showing....
1854 2018-09-19 19:39:31 i went to work
and i was stocking oil
and i had 20 boxes 
boss man said
"stock as much as you can and the other guy will do the rest when he comes"
and i finished it all before the dude showed up so my boss was like
big cum
1855 2018-09-19 19:39:30 I would bet that Trump has the oil barons in his pocket.

1861 2018-09-19 19:38:45 Forgetting all the bubbles in past 25 years? Bitcoin/block chain. Gold. Oil. High tech.
1862 2018-09-19 19:38:24 Demand for liquid energy is increasing and will do so for decades. We all need and use oil. There is no switch that will turn off that demand and need. We in Canada are spooled because we have our energy needs available on demand.
1863 2018-09-19 19:38:24 I’ve always thought oil cleansers aren’t really efficient as a sole cleanser especially if you’re wearing makeup. Are there specific skin types you think this works better for?
1864 2018-09-19 19:38:19 Air rifles are legal in most places. I own a 45 cal that can take down a buffalo at 100 yrds
1865 2018-09-19 19:38:00 i put my cup right away from it today.
1866 2018-09-19 19:38:00 so I was eating olives and I was just thinking why the fuck is this shit so oily like these bitches tryna make me break out. then a few minutes later I had a realisation that olive OIL comes from olives
1867 2018-09-19 19:37:21 Cool gl with it no more spilling coffee ....
1868 2018-09-19 19:37:18 Bought $PER @ 2.60.  It is an oil royalty trust with a trailing twelve month distribution rate over 17%.  It is a K-1 investment so better to put into retirement account if you don't want to deal with accounting paperwork at tax time.
1869 2018-09-19 19:37:18 Not true. Fdi in russia always been fraction of that into CEE. Trade is: russian sell oil, we sell machines &dresses. Non cis inbound tourism to Rus c.1m pa until World Cup when jumped to 11mn for those 2months. Engagement not much beyond import the hookers &facilitate oligarchs
1870 2018-09-19 19:37:13 Thank God he clarified it was what I thought they were sitting in a crude oil flood
1871 2018-09-19 19:37:13 We have our own oil at ngamia moja I don't see the essence of the VAT I see it's high time tujichimbie mafuta kwa nyumba...#GoodEveningKenya
1872 2018-09-19 19:37:11 @HowieCarrShow Your credibility takes a hit every time you promote snake-oil like Life Change Tea or Ancient Life Oil. It is one thing to have spots run by affiliates that you have no control over but to accept sponsors pushing pure hokum?
1873 2018-09-19 19:37:06 Maybe I’ll walk out tomorrow with a new car instead of one with a new oil
1874 2018-09-19 19:37:04 They are called oil burners sir lol
1875 2018-09-19 19:37:04 That's the kind of response I would expect from a FORMER GM exec. Thanks for the input Bob, we'll call you when we need an oil change!
1876 2018-09-19 19:36:44 Get facials. Take vitamin E, and shave with coconut oil. After shave with witch hazel and jojoba oil. Million dollar secret. Thank me in 5 years.
1877 2018-09-19 19:36:42 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
1878 2018-09-19 19:36:33 That's the price of imposed democracy trading water for oil
1879 2018-09-19 19:36:26 Make peace, not war.  Put that money into infrastructure.  We have not fought any wars in years except for gas and oil.  If you understood climate change you would know investing there is more important.
1880 2018-09-19 19:36:24 The Constitution says "We the People..." not "We the Oil and Gas Industry." 

Zinke and the corrupt Trump administration forgets that they are supposed to be representing the people and protecting the Constitution, not lining their own pockets.
1881 2018-09-19 19:36:18 yep  2 on the list 
so I shall order some !!
yes...I did...new logic board, keyboard, battery the works.
1882 2018-09-19 19:35:51 Yes, first enterprising Ukrainian farmers raise grain for profit, then you expropriate those selfish kulaks and sell the grain.
Oil works too.
1883 2018-09-19 19:35:50 He sold his soul to big oil?
1884 2018-09-19 19:35:50 My sister was my roommate and I remember once she stole my money and yelled at me for confronting her. I put baby oil in front of our door for when she walked in. She stayed at a friends house that night, forgot about the baby oil on the floor walked in the room fell on my ass.
1885 2018-09-19 19:35:46 Spennende! Jeg er ikke inne i DNO for øyeblikket. Har satsa på Africa Oil Corp, som jeg tror blir spennende, mye undervurdert exploration rundt Africa. Lykke til med DNO caset!
1886 2018-09-19 19:35:22 Hi Sunil, we use palm oil and palm kernel oil because they make for a beautifully textured, sudsy and effective bar soap. I’m sure you’ll be glad to know that the palm oil we source is from sustainable farms, and our soaps are certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.
1887 2018-09-19 19:35:20 google says olive oil
1888 2018-09-19 19:35:15 —Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then       orangeflower water...
1889 2018-09-19 19:34:47 Maybe he actually drank some of his snake oil.  
1890 2018-09-19 19:34:39 coconut oil
1891 2018-09-19 19:34:37 Terrible idea. Non selective poisoning should NEVER be done.
1892 2018-09-19 19:34:21 vape oil. Please I must see
1893 2018-09-19 19:34:18 Currently wedged between:
-2 ovens
-2 large volume high temperature oil baths
-1 pump/oil bath that's venting hot air directly onto me

...I'm just going to think of this as 'fursuit endurance training'.

1898 2018-09-19 19:33:51 Told ya so yesterday. Major hedge fund players are betting that the Iran sanctions will cause oil prices to rally to $120/barrel. Fuck the consumer and little guy, these hedge funds are gonna make a lot of fiat. It's just sick...all of it!!!!
1899 2018-09-19 19:33:48 I went to get an oil change and that meme is literally happening right now. Mechanic guy came back and was like ma’am come look at this
1900 2018-09-19 19:33:42 how is other Oil producing country funding there recurrent expenditure ?

1912 2018-09-19 19:32:24 Iran's crude oil export dropped to 1,6 million bpd from 2,5 million bpd. This is achieved even before November 4 deadline.

On 4 November, second and strongest wave of sanctions will begin.
1913 2018-09-19 19:32:23 First, I never complained about anything, so I don't get where you calling me a complainant is coming from. I tweeted about something (not to you) & you felt I was wrong. So you're the complainant. But you want me to prove my tweet to your dull brain. I don't have your time.
1914 2018-09-19 19:32:08 running out of oil for my oil burner I need to get more
1915 2018-09-19 19:32:02 I haven't tried that yet! My hair is probably the one place that I've struggled with whilst changing to green beauty. I do need a new hair oil - I'll keep yours in mind! 
1916 2018-09-19 19:31:50 Ethan just spilled all or my Moroccan oil and hes sitting there trying to act like it wasnt him but he cant hide the smell lmao
1917 2018-09-19 19:31:37 The so-called blessings you mention include institutionalized racism, but since there were no white people before 1681 we must subtract blessings created before that, including fire, clothing, agriculture, architecture, oil paintings, sculpture, most musical instruments........
1918 2018-09-19 19:31:34 Purposely cooked champorado just now and put it in the ref so i have chilled champorado tomorrow morning. 
1919 2018-09-19 19:31:34 $HSE.CA Hit a 52 week high and promptly backed off. One of the best plays in the Canadian oil patch. Buy on weakness
1920 2018-09-19 19:31:20 Just goes to show, that the squeaky wheel and wife get the oil!
In their case, they got the juice
1921 2018-09-19 19:31:15 My creative process:

1) Come up with idea.
2) Sell the shit out of it. I call this the "snake oil salesman" phase.
3) Execute it while 8 more ideas beckon sexily to distract me.
1922 2018-09-19 19:31:14 Chopped Tomatos, chillis & onion with red wine vinegar & olive oil for a tasty fresh salsa over oven cooked tortillas
1923 2018-09-19 19:31:03 What kind of plantains do you like? Emelia just slices them about 1/4-1/2 an inch thick and fries them in a skillet with oil coming about halfway up them, for a few minutes until soft.

I just tried this and tripled the amount of product I have! Plus, it’s easier to use than ever
#LifeHacks #WednesdayWisdom
1928 2018-09-19 19:30:21 An oil producing nation that doesn’t have the right facilities to refine its own oil for use by it citizens but import finished products is not serious. Manufacturing discussions should begin from our REFINERY #TOR #BringBackTOR @benkoku @MBawumia @NAkufoAddo @KojoAB #CitiCBS
1929 2018-09-19 19:30:21 Kenya joined oil producing and exporting countries(OPEC) yet they pay more on fuel due to high taxes. Corruption is really expensive!!!!
1930 2018-09-19 19:30:21 so, the reason for whole country dying of hunger is the president's lunch bill of $200 ?? do you believe that ?

or the real reason is US dont like maduro's policy and sanctioned his country ? or exxon & chevron preventing venzuella to sell its own oil freely ? what's ur reason ?
1931 2018-09-19 19:30:17 cbd oil is the future!!

"Only if the wearer is burned in oil"
1934 2018-09-19 19:29:31 Increased oil production to fund recurrent expenditure? Profligacy is thy name.
1935 2018-09-19 19:29:08 #CommonScamsIKnow the govt of Kenya raising 16% VAT on petroleum products yet we are an oil producing country.
1936 2018-09-19 19:29:08 Deal is already done.10Billion USD + Oil on loan from KSA.
1937 2018-09-19 19:29:07 I blocked M*chael M**re because he is a charlatan and snake oil salesman of the highest order. He is the kaiju the Krassenstein brothers wish they could form. But people won't stop dumping him into my TL.

1940 2018-09-19 19:28:27 The rain is beating against the window so hard you are slightly worried the window might crack. You have no power you’ve never had power the oil lamps are your only source of light as you sit in your rocking chair knitting trying hard to convince yourself that you are truly alone
1941 2018-09-19 19:28:25 Wow I’m so sorry whatever settings we had on here caused us to not see this tweet. The oil does indeed leave a beautiful, subtle(not disco ball) shimmer. Our butter does as well! -VV
1942 2018-09-19 19:28:20 Trumps ran business for how long and he’s gone bankrupt multiple times. Also in terms of investment it’s better to have an appealing country to outside investors and investing in a less oil dependent country strengthens our economy against the inflation of a limited resource.
1943 2018-09-19 19:28:14 Oh thats great me 2 Did you get your new laptop?

1946 2018-09-19 19:27:49 I got hot fryer oil in my eye today, hows your day going
1947 2018-09-19 19:27:44 Lol nimejisokota nywele na pure coconut oil I swear if my hair isn't curly by morning ....
1948 2018-09-19 19:27:41 Omega fish oil 1,2,3 is the Best
1949 2018-09-19 19:27:39 Hydrogen is very expensive to produce though it is pretty abundant. That is the reason Tesla is not betting big on hydrogen.
The oil lobby will soon become hydrogen lobby.
1950 2018-09-19 19:27:31 I'm a bit emotional right now I'll get over it! I always do.I stick to the truth stay away from folk who make assumptions!With my life, annointing it's dangerous I must have fresh oil and a place of safety A new environment I'll have it soon then I'll be seen in the right light!
1951 2018-09-19 19:27:30 DIRTY STINKING OIL CLUB
1952 2018-09-19 19:27:27 Με τέτοια φορολογία, με 710.000 ληξιπρόθεσμους οφειλέτες των Ταμείων δεν μπορεί να συμβεί αυτό. Οι μόνοι που μπορούν να δώσουν είναι το λεγόμενο "μεγάλο κεφάλαιο". Αυτοί δίνουν αυξήσεις και μπόνους. Κοίτα Motor Oil-Καρέλια- Μυτιληναίο. Είναι όμως μόνο το 0,6% του επιχειρείν
1953 2018-09-19 19:27:26 Today I attended the 4 the Uganda International oil and gas summit at Serena in Kampala. There are so many opportunities in this sector but all through the summit I  felt Ugandans (businesses / investors )are just not aware ...
1954 2018-09-19 19:27:15 no i was being serious. i read the list earlier.
1955 2018-09-19 19:27:13 Oil change? Bad breaks?
1956 2018-09-19 19:27:07 1st part of a staged move into electricity supply. The recent persistent o&g price dips i think have forced this move (tho interesting to see if they are still interested if oil goes back up to $80). I think some elec utilities do view this as a genuine move/ threat.
1957 2018-09-19 19:27:00 This is a transaqution of the mammalian glands it help decide the invocation of a new oil marastus
1958 2018-09-19 19:26:55 I just bought a cool new shoes I threw out all my old clothes because they had chemtrails on them! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
1959 2018-09-19 19:26:41 Did you know that oil & gas fracking contaminates our water? Did you know that fracking has been permitted in our aquifers and drinking water sources in Adams County? #ProtectDrinkingWater
1960 2018-09-19 19:26:37 You can make your own with coconut oil and sugar.
1961 2018-09-19 19:26:30 They have moved very quick and a lot of big money going in probably due a correction but the prospects are massive for a global company.

1963 2018-09-19 19:26:06 uh io giocavo a green house, panic oil e donkey kong
1964 2018-09-19 19:26:00 I’m out here getting yelled at by this dude giving me an oil change  I don’t need it from you, that’s what my actual father @gmv4 is supposed to do 
1965 2018-09-19 19:25:54 ur forgeting pizza, lasagna, bread with olive oil
1966 2018-09-19 19:25:49 "Give me 50 cents worth of regular
Check my oil too if you don't mind
Put some air in my tires won't you mister
Wash my windows too if you have time"
1967 2018-09-19 19:25:47 Oil. Much cheaper.
1968 2018-09-19 19:25:46 If you sprincle some coconut oil on your pan-fried cale 
you can scrape it easyer into the trash.
1969 2018-09-19 19:25:43 my mums the cutest person ever we were talking yesterday bout how when I was younger and poorly she’d put olbas oil on my pillow she’s gone to the shop today bought some and done it :((((
1970 2018-09-19 19:25:43 Vegan cheese, lots of veggies and olive oil at the end!
1971 2018-09-19 19:25:23 Probably needs a can. 
5w-20
Oil filter.
Air filter is optional.
1972 2018-09-19 19:25:16 praying for a depay screamer against this dirty stinking oil club
1973 2018-09-19 19:25:03 Some type of pasta (prefer chicken Alfredo with   )with garlic  &. Asparagus roasted garlic or herbed oil on’em
1974 2018-09-19 19:24:58 See told y’all we start wars for #oil and etc... hence the long Iraq/Afghanistan war
1975 2018-09-19 19:24:55 Or we can hide behind gravestones and scare big oil assholes. Wear sheets and make spooky noises.
1976 2018-09-19 19:24:53 I’m starting an herbal medicine company called “Earth papa snake oils” check out the hairline repair tincture made of 100% flaxseed oil, dissolved listerine strips, and placebo effect. Link to the Etsy page in my bio, help support my tiny house build.
1977 2018-09-19 19:24:49 Awesome shot of the @towerofamericas! Great city for an oil and gas conference. @COSAGOV @HartEnergyConf #DUGEagleFord
1978 2018-09-19 19:24:37 Be v v careful when washing your face! Get an oil free face wash. To keep them curly, blow dry them upward at a low heat.
1979 2018-09-19 19:24:33 I just gave away the bread and oil/pesto mix that came with my lunch to my coworker. It was painful. #lifechanges
1980 2018-09-19 19:24:32 Also. They have oil. We’d be LOADED.
1981 2018-09-19 19:24:31 I agree we have involved ourselves militarily in an international conflict to protect business interests. I agree terrorism was caused by our involvement in propping up brutal dictator or engaging in wars in the Middle East over oil. But also believe we have tried to do good. 2/
1982 2018-09-19 19:24:26 Because our oil is land locked without enough pipeline capacity to get it to world markets...so we sell at a discount to the US.
1983 2018-09-19 19:24:17 Have you ever had an "Italian" sandwich? It's a thing in Maine where my dad grew up, & it is LEGIT the BEST SANDWICH EVER. It's ham, salami, pepperoni, provalone cheese, green peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, black olives, onions and olive oil on a sub roll. I'm so hungry.
1984 2018-09-19 19:23:46 Why? The royalties are paid before that. You are just a tool for the oil industry. A giant tool.
1985 2018-09-19 19:23:41 Me n cold water we like water and oil
1986 2018-09-19 19:23:35 You're not big in oil, Ken. You wouldn't understand.
1987 2018-09-19 19:23:31 Ok thanks ..excellent effect ..couldn't tell if it was oil or acrylic .
I have used calcium carbonate on a few paintings which gives some nice effects ..well if it was good enough for Rembrandt its good enough for me :-)
1988 2018-09-19 19:23:18 The only time i notice i can’t run my fingers through the ends is when i go days without doing shit to it... no moisturizing, coconut oil, nothing
1989 2018-09-19 19:23:17 Parang ayaw matagal sa hininga ko yung amoy ng truffle oil. Nagtoothbrush na ako  baho talaga nung mushroom na yun :3
1990 2018-09-19 19:23:12 They spent 1.5billion on consultation according to a tweep... something that they could’ve consulted irunmole just by bringing palm oil and 15yards of white clothes
1991 2018-09-19 19:22:59 we use suppliers that are certified members of RSPO, the world’s leading organisation working to sustainable & ethical values in palm oil production & we only ever source our palm oil from Colombia where orangutans are not native species
1992 2018-09-19 19:22:55 Where did Scotlands oil  wealth go That suggests its gone which is a lie.
 it should be  where is it going 
Don't be fooled
1993 2018-09-19 19:22:52 Eat some coconut oil about 1/2 tbsp or put it in your coffee it helps with that
1994 2018-09-19 19:22:52 I have two on the list.
1995 2018-09-19 19:22:46 I have a morning routine. Every single morning. Part of it includes the application of an essential oil (to my nostrils, wrists, neck). I’ve also begun to put it on just before I go on stage to present or teach. (My mental edge, gets me psyched)
1996 2018-09-19 19:22:40 Why'd you put the oil there
1997 2018-09-19 19:22:39 Maybe with fitness and figure competitions there's a better chance of finding someone who hasn't relied on plastic surgery to optimize their physique.  The personality part indicates a snake oil salesperson of sorts.
1998 2018-09-19 19:22:29 No that’s just your rather narrow minded perspective- rest assured the majority had a fuller understanding than you wish to claim. Now about that claim oil was a bonus and not the basis of the Yes pitch...
1999 2018-09-19 19:22:27 I added Lavender Essential Oil.
2000 2018-09-19 19:22:19 until you helped them again and we got the riots of the 60's and Viet Nam, then good time began and you stopped that and gave oil shortages with Jimmy then the 80's and greatest economic expansion in the History of the World then Bill and Waco and Saddam Hussein.
2001 2018-09-19 19:22:12 Started putting coconut oil on my eyebrows every night and I’ve been noticing some hair growth.. makes me happy to see progress! 
2002 2018-09-19 19:22:10 My understanding is that you can only purchase the land for an oil and gas lease, which doesn't hand over ownership, just a lease to potentially use BLM land.
2003 2018-09-19 19:22:03 Why are we still fighting if oil is no longer a priority?
2004 2018-09-19 19:21:33 And this is with oil at > $60 in 2018. If there's a price slump, just sell the country.
2005 2018-09-19 19:21:27 Now if we can only convince the Canadians to take their oil up thattaway to their Arctic border, shortening shipping times, instead of through pipelines they plan to build to Vancouver, BC and the precious Salish Sea... home to endangered orcas as well as salmon communities need.

2007 2018-09-19 19:21:12 Hmmmm, couldn't you switch to coconut oil? Much better for the orangutans  #OrganicHour
2008 2018-09-19 19:20:56 Explícale eso a Mobil Oil y sus iguales.
2009 2018-09-19 19:20:50 Becoming what?,a hypocrite,look at me,i'm lovely!all the while my husband sanctioned Bombing seven shades of shit out of numerous countries who wouldn't have anything to do with the petro Dollar,and sold their oil to whom they wanted!!.Murderer!!!
2010 2018-09-19 19:20:33 I wonder if cannabis oil will help with my anxiety? I’ve heard really good things..
2011 2018-09-19 19:20:31 Agreed. As a Persian-American who came to the United States at age 3, to escape the Islamic Revolution, I know damn well how little conservatives & Republicans care about the Iranian people.

They just want a regime change to get at Iran’s oil. As they did to Mossadegh in 1953.
2012 2018-09-19 19:20:24 What does it use instead of sulfates? I hear coconut oil works just as well
2013 2018-09-19 19:20:21  Now with exotic Argon Oil
2014 2018-09-19 19:20:20 It is necessary to insult this “Kinglet sitting on Oil” 5 times by day for - Al-Kaeda forming, Yémen War, DAESH supporting, Women slavery and Chariat.
2015 2018-09-19 19:20:03 I mix magnolia oil, castor oil,coconut oil nd glycerin. U can also add spirit to the mixture
2016 2018-09-19 19:20:01 or you could just try some cbd oil! 
2017 2018-09-19 19:19:57 Look at Poland. Maybe a fort Trump there and they are buying American LPG gas or something that puts the Russia country of one product of oil weaker
2018 2018-09-19 19:19:57 I want my oil changed. I don’t want my air filters changed my coolant topped off my tires rotated or new wipers. But thank you for asking
2019 2018-09-19 19:19:46 Complain about the lack of pipelines and access to global markets and lost opportunities for Canadians dumb ass. Yes we don’t import foreign oil idiot.
2020 2018-09-19 19:19:45 "Hmm. Maybe dont need to clean much before guests arrives"

2022 2018-09-19 19:19:15 Ice water, motor oil, and a shitload of plaque.
2023 2018-09-19 19:19:15 cbd oil too!!!!! 
2024 2018-09-19 19:19:04 Don't forget to nourish your hair as well! Have you tried my Scented Organic Hair Oil as an ibernight treatment for your hair uet? Wake up with hair that feels and looks 10 years younger

2026 2018-09-19 19:18:32 The structure in place for extracting oil from the vast wells of Venezuela needs updating.  They still have 1950’s technology in use which is slow and inefficient, hence output vs cost, margins are low. Past Presidents made it a thing to distribute revenue to the people 
2027 2018-09-19 19:18:31 I said no mayo and they put the packets in the bag. Soy bean oil and sugar 
2028 2018-09-19 19:18:30 My dad would be proud. Just changed my own oil. 
2029 2018-09-19 19:18:12 great to hear you're Organix fans! We use palm oil as when making biscuits a hard fat is needed to form the dough and give the biscuits a suitable texture, particularly in little one's food where the texture is so important for safety....
2030 2018-09-19 19:18:07 omg did your skin purge with the sunday riley oil before it got better???
2031 2018-09-19 19:17:33 have you ever wanted to try something else for pain? like cbd oil??
2032 2018-09-19 19:17:23 Just Fast for 3days while applying Castro oil 
2033 2018-09-19 19:17:06 Learning oil and gas at the Gulf Coast #industryforum2018. @Port_Houston has such an economic impact. Love seeing govt and industry come together.
2034 2018-09-19 19:16:58 Maybe the Chinese are more open minded about the future of the planet, and less hung up on oil and ICE cars.
2035 2018-09-19 19:16:29 I’m about 10,000 miles overdue for an oil change and now I’m scared cause my car making noises lol
2036 2018-09-19 19:16:27 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.

2041 2018-09-19 19:15:51 Essentially I think at their inception Patreon imagined that their creating user base was going to be made up of musicians, flowery poets, oil painters etc. and didn't really expect the boom in varying degrees of adult modelling that they ended up with.
2042 2018-09-19 19:15:48 They substituted more chickpea and olive oil with soybean oil and added antioxidants and stabilizers ...
2043 2018-09-19 19:15:43 It's running rough plus its time for an oil change and brakes
2044 2018-09-19 19:15:40 Because its all about the demon with...oil... right?
2045 2018-09-19 19:15:31 this problem is purely the fault of the FGN.
FGN has contenue to maintain Oil production of 2 million barrels since 1999 while other Oil producing country like Angola with less than 70 million in population has increase oil production to over 4 million barrels.
we need to expand
2046 2018-09-19 19:15:27 cbd oil is the move for pain!

2049 2018-09-19 19:14:52 The mayor ain't gon' be able to scare Aunt May like Olive Oil will.
2050 2018-09-19 19:14:50 Well I suppose you can also use the oil. But this recipe was given to me by an old lady in Orkney and it really helped after suffering with a headache for a couple of months.
2051 2018-09-19 19:14:48 Rumor has it they are being oil painted as we speak
2052 2018-09-19 19:14:31 Girl I gotta dip stick to check that oil!
2053 2018-09-19 19:14:06 Requirements: helium boobs, fishy botoxed lips. Head down to Texas and hook up with an oil magnate...you are welcome! 
2054 2018-09-19 19:14:04 But they contain palm oil 
2055 2018-09-19 19:13:54 Does this apply to home heating fuel oil also?
2056 2018-09-19 19:13:53 I’m getting a car wash and my oil changed and I’m so embarrassed cos my car so dirty

2058 2018-09-19 19:13:18 I cooked the meat w/a little taco seasoning, 2 minced Habaneros and a half-bunch of minced Cilantro.  After cooking, I mixed in the rest of the cilantro, diced onion, Serrano, and jalapeno peppers...  Corn tortillas fried in coconut oil, Romaine, grated cheddar...
MMMMMMMM!!!  
2059 2018-09-19 19:13:17 You forgot the oil 
2060 2018-09-19 19:13:15 Can the general public bid on the land for use other than oil and gas exploration - e.g. I want to build a ranch house in the wilderness near Ely? $2 an acre is a steal.
2061 2018-09-19 19:13:14 O/N Wrap:
Equities ticked higher, a rally in oil and allayed trade fears more than offsetting a slumping in tech; UK CPI ramps back up, prompting volatility in the #GBP; USD in the dog box, allowing #NZD and #AUD to push higher - Kiwi now looking comfy above 0.6600.
2062 2018-09-19 19:13:10 have you ever used cbd oil?
2063 2018-09-19 19:12:51 try cbd oil!

2069 2018-09-19 19:12:24 Lots of oil there!
2070 2018-09-19 19:12:19 A brand new oil sands mine the size of Cleveland just opened and a refinery and a deal was just made to build another $8.5B refinery. 

The patch is hiring anything with a pulse right now.

2074 2018-09-19 19:11:51 Probably the same "Science" that ignores the massive carbon footprint of unethical foreign oil being tankered in.

The same "Science" that ignores leading Canadian methods & regulations which would lower WW emissions if implemented world wide
2075 2018-09-19 19:11:50 Nah they’re just a relatively poorly supported side who hit the (dirty) oil jackpot.
2076 2018-09-19 19:11:44 @jimcramer Do you see companies like JNJ partnering up in The Cannabis/CBD oil sector?
2077 2018-09-19 19:11:37 Lmao RT @_ItsDon_: @StoneyDBrown @HD_Vee Nope Bitch dirty bitch need gas bitch got a flat oil change again bitch damn bitch got a ticket smh
2078 2018-09-19 19:11:35 But think about all the marriage proposals I've received from Army Generals and Oil magnets (that's not a spello)
2079 2018-09-19 19:11:20 I always thought this was weird/annoying/sexist that whenever I’m anywhere in public with my car hood propped up, it never fails that SOMEONE has to go out of their way to ask me, “is everything okay,” “do you need help”. 

It’s like yo...I’m just checking my oil..??

2085 2018-09-19 19:10:24 An almost inviolable law: When a scientist (a real one with real credentials) tries to promote an idea or a product via social media or books for the general public instead of the professional literature, it means that whatever he/she is peddling is snake oil by any other name.

2145 2018-09-19 19:03:17 Not the type of Castor oil you getting now, I'm talking the thick smelly one that gets stuck to the inside of your mouth. You have to scrape your tongue with a knife and the smell was worse. The best part three kids would get it at the same time and we only had 1 toilet 
2146 2018-09-19 19:03:16 Your view... approved pipelines and deregulation hurts their oil prices permanently.. he’s no lapdog for money like your Berry
2147 2018-09-19 19:02:57 Houston's economy did not take as hard a hit in 2008 because oil and healthcare were still strong. Local industry can be enough to mitigate the local effects of a recession; I can see the same happening here.

2153 2018-09-19 19:02:34 Well some of it might have to do with the fact that we don't just want to stop at the coasts. Oil companies want to ship the oil, so those that say a pipeline is safer then leaks in tankers. So Its two issues we need to ship our oil abroad. No part of country should be importing

2155 2018-09-19 19:02:14 ...the oil companies, as people ‘panic’ and fill up knowing it’s going to go up. 

And of course thanksgiving weekend it will go up as well, even though it is usually on it’s way down on weekends. But people traveling, therefore price will go up.

2157 2018-09-19 19:02:00 When you have to get an oil change but you really don’t feel like it but your already 4K miles over because you didn’t feel like it before so you can’t just not feel like it because then your engines gonna lock and your car will be done for just cause you didn’t feel like it.

2163 2018-09-19 19:01:21 But there is a money connection to global warming. The banking system and their corporations do not want to give up money streams that are harming the planet, such as oil & coal. Central Banks own stock in just about every major corporation especially the older ones.

2167 2018-09-19 19:01:04 It is now clear Trudeau’s election strategy is to strut around PRETENDING to stand up to Trump. In reality, Trudeau’s taxes & red tape are sending our money, jobs & oil on-the-cheap to Trump’s economy.

2206 2018-09-19 18:57:09 Oh wow, good for her!

I've heard that cannabis oil can also really help with seizures and such, but it is frowned upon because of that damn stigma.

It's such an incredible plant, and we are not using it to its potential due to "reefer madness"

Angola with less than 70 million in population produce over 4 million barrels of crude while Nigeria with over 180 million people is still producing about 2millon
2227 2018-09-19 18:55:22 Heath - CBD oil is a good anti inflammatory. Go pick some up at Wilner Chemists near Grand Central. 
2228 2018-09-19 18:55:17 What percentage of methane comes from Natural Wetlands vs Oil and Gas production or Landfills  ?
2229 2018-09-19 18:55:16 You need to look in the mirror & realize you are running an elite protection racket. You are protecting Hedge/Private Equity Funds, WS, Big Oil, Military Industrial Complex, CIA/FBI factions, MBZ/MBS, & Putin'sInner Circle. Quit projecting!
2230 2018-09-19 18:54:38 @LaBeautyologist Can I use an oil cleanser if I don’t wear make up?
2231 2018-09-19 18:54:29 Yup and we all remember the embarrassment of snake oil salesman Cameron slithering to them begging for something... anything...but nah! 
No way.
We're there just to obey and give them money.

2238 2018-09-19 18:53:26 4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
2239 2018-09-19 18:53:01 Dropped my truck off for an oil change at 8:30 this morning. Was told it would be a 5 hour wait. Ok that’s fine. Called at 1:45 just to check and see if it was ready. They haven’t even gotten to my truck. Not fine.
2240 2018-09-19 18:52:59 Actually Mike, the world is a better place because of oil with increased standard of living, wealth, life expectancy, education, access to medicine and the very technology you use to promote bringing us back 150 years. But keep on spreading lies trying to destroy our country.
2241 2018-09-19 18:52:52 Linda Ikeji’s baby daddy is an oil magnate. Wawuuu
2242 2018-09-19 18:52:42 Kyle put more oil on the  #YR
2243 2018-09-19 18:52:13 In nj you are not allowed to pump your own gas.  But i know how, i do it when im out of state.  I can also check oil.  I wanted a car real bad.  Went to high school and had 2 jobs by the time i was 16.  Paid cash for my car, a 67 red mustang
2244 2018-09-19 18:52:13 Is it falling due to actual real good paying jobs, is it falling because many no longer qualify and are falling out of the system is it falling because they are taking 2 part time jobs, the world can buy our oil if someone would get busy and do a pipeline
2245 2018-09-19 18:52:11 Is this the truck that was carrying cooking oil?
2246 2018-09-19 18:52:01 i’m wearing my dads shirt he made with his car club in high school it’s covered in car oil and cigarette burns but I Love Her
2247 2018-09-19 18:52:00 Not with this teachers union going against Alberta oil
2248 2018-09-19 18:51:59 Stubbs: 1.2 million barrels of oil are flowing through pipelines approved by Conservatives. What do you have? Zero.

Trudeau: Just to correct the record, here's a list of not-oil projects we've approved.

2249 2018-09-19 18:51:58 Thank you for the info! Will do anything to help my baby feel better.  He’s only 2 :-( fingers crossed that between the combo of his new medicine and CBD oil he will have no more seizures 
2250 2018-09-19 18:51:56 Yes, it's easy, read the damn ingredients.. I've completely cut palm oil out of my diet. You cannot buy anything Hershey is associated with. Sure, we don't get our snickers or our Reeses pieces, but the environment is worth more than a sugartooth
2251 2018-09-19 18:51:52 All Religion is a Form of Madness! Makes me mad! Oprah is actually an eagle wearing a big costume! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!

2254 2018-09-19 18:51:37 I need to slow down on my oil usuage. But it feels sooooo good on these braids.
2255 2018-09-19 18:51:29 Other way around... the U.S. is refining the Russian oil in WA... they want  oil... but we can't get it to them. BC needs that oil for their cars across the border... BC is our problem... #TRANSMOUNTAIN PIPELINE MUST GO THROUGH
2256 2018-09-19 18:51:27 Its a pity that #c4news in their report of the state and crisis in #Venezuela give no context of years of sanctions, attempted coups, and violence organised and lead by the US because they have the audacity to use oil revenue against poverty and not for the elites! #chavez
2257 2018-09-19 18:51:23 Totally agreed! Cool thing that uncharming oil clubs also can have good supporters that sings their lungs out.
2258 2018-09-19 18:51:22 car window fixed. now an oil change.... y can’t they make these things easy and cheap

2265 2018-09-19 18:50:10 I usually hate leftovers, but I had leftover bulgogi, peppers and onions from a casserole, broccoli from orange chicken, and some rice... and it made a pretty tasty lunch punched up with kimchi, sesame oil, and soy sauce.
2266 2018-09-19 18:49:56 will this CBD oil break my fast and will it cure my crippling hatred of useless people in the music biz?

2269 2018-09-19 18:49:36 We had pizzas @uclachem for which you needed 3 napkins to remove the extra oil from melted cheese.
But loved it though
2270 2018-09-19 18:49:35 True. And there are about 2.6M miles of paved road in the USA. Thanks oil!

2287 2018-09-19 18:47:20 they did it over 100 years ago with electric cars. The fuel industry where losing money so belittled the electric car idea ,it's all about $$$$$$ again. Greedy oil industry again @elonmusk am I right?

2293 2018-09-19 18:46:49 So the US, which has refining capacity problems, is refining Canadian oil while Canada refines Russian oil. Makes a lot of sense to me???
2294 2018-09-19 18:46:39 You're just making me repeat what I said, simple basic law,the complainant comes with proof to back his allegation not the accused.
I can't help you get proof fr ur tantrums.

2302 2018-09-19 18:45:56 I agree that we are biased but you owe me an apology for assuming I was wrong just because we support different causes. I've told you why borrowing in FX is riskier. You don't control oil prices so you don't control FX earnings for now until you earn more FX outside oil.
2303 2018-09-19 18:45:49 Brought my new car in to get an oil change and I didn’t know how to pop my hood or turn on my lights, don’t ask me how my day is going

2327 2018-09-19 18:43:14 I am going to start growing my own purely to make oil. I don't smoke but have used the oil for a year for arthritis. Never taken a painkiller since. Tired of being ripped off. What they charge for oil is ludicrous.
2328 2018-09-19 18:42:53 I think I just got robbed. $70 for an oil change?! 
2329 2018-09-19 18:42:49 I’m pretty sure I could drive a brand new car right off the lot and straight to get the oil changed and they would still try to sell me new tires and an air filter

2358 2018-09-19 18:40:12 I heard sandalwood oil helps. Worth a try.
2359 2018-09-19 18:40:07 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
2360 2018-09-19 18:40:02 I’ve tried so many and loved every single one but Jason and the argan oil is the bomb dot com
2361 2018-09-19 18:40:02 carhartt and dickies, like oil and water
2362 2018-09-19 18:40:00 They’re all experts on Oil and Gas Economics, civil engineering, the economy, law yet barely any of them even knows the UK is a country.
2363 2018-09-19 18:39:58 Try some Fabreeze. And if that doesn't work lemon oil.
2364 2018-09-19 18:39:54 This is a branch of trump's belief that "to the victor go the spoils" in regards to Iraq's oil reserves

Place this in the profound ignorance of most things column...if there is room as it is crowded
2365 2018-09-19 18:39:53 Nutella is like 15% palm oil. There are better spreads out there

2368 2018-09-19 18:39:21 Calories are very important for losing weight but to eliminate stubborn fat, eat as healthy and plain as possible so be cautious of sauces and spices. Minimize the amount of fruit you consume and include metabolism boosters like coffee and coconut oil. Also eat avocados.

2370 2018-09-19 18:39:16 I started listening to it with you here at the farm! We played the Valdez Oil Spill ep while eating breakfast. I remember hearing it wasn't even the biggest spill that year and since then I listen every time a new episode goes out.
2371 2018-09-19 18:39:16 @RonPaul Thanks for turning a spotlight on US support for Al Quaida. Doubtless, the US wants to hand Syria over to the Sunni rebels to satisfy Sunni Saudi Arabia on which US depends for oil  and for jobs in armaments sales. It also satisfies Israel which wants Syria annihilated.
2372 2018-09-19 18:39:13 Is that just a bowl of pasta with olive oil and mushrooms
2373 2018-09-19 18:39:12 How much more public land are you going to destroy with Big Gas & Oil, Big Mining Interests?
You're still in the running for the title of "Most Swampy" in Trump's "Swamp Olympics".

2376 2018-09-19 18:38:40 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.

2378 2018-09-19 18:38:27 I’d love to do a Bob Ross painting but I don’t have any of the oil paint or aisle or anything :(
2379 2018-09-19 18:38:22 Time to bath in salt water with rose oil LOL
2380 2018-09-19 18:38:13 Nope it's 1k here in Ibadan. Then I buy pepper and all N500. I already have oil and other seasoning ingredients. The stew lasts me a week
2381 2018-09-19 18:38:09 It was my pleasure  lovely to meet them all.  I’m going to think on the olive oil spray, there’s something in it I’m sure 
2382 2018-09-19 18:38:02 You need to pick up some Coconut oil Dank unless you already have some. Saute her kale lightly in the pan with the oil. The oil will help the kale slide into the bin so much easier...
2383 2018-09-19 18:38:01 It's a non sequitur. I put oil in my car yesterday, doesn't make me a mechanic
2384 2018-09-19 18:37:51 As much as I hate to say it, Chili Oil is basically a condiment in Northern Chinese cuisine, whereas Sriracha, or at least David Tran's Huy Fong version is not native to his Vietnam. (I'm Viet-Chinese just like him). The growing Chinese immigrants have a great affinity to LGM.
2385 2018-09-19 18:37:47 What was he advising oil companies on?  Drilling techniques, rig placement? Any idea?
2386 2018-09-19 18:37:37 Ever been so drunk that you went in for an oil change but forgot to bring a car? Yeah, me neither.
2387 2018-09-19 18:37:26 A final question from Cllr Laws now, again to Cllr Peall: “Can you tell me who finally removed the waste oil from Lydd Level Crossing a couple of weeks ago, where it was fly-tipped?” (1/3)
2388 2018-09-19 18:37:21 And without oil and gas figures. Get us out Nic
2389 2018-09-19 18:37:18 The fact that a bottle of truffle oil smaller than my thumb is $20 is a problem !

2392 2018-09-19 18:37:04 What's the name of that giant French oil company? Fina? I remember them signing a yuge contract with Iran a long time ago. 

Was it a French Connection that got Hazbullah into narco-trafficking?
2393 2018-09-19 18:37:03 As for oil companies and gas stations, I totally agree that never having to stop at a gas station is a big advantage of an EV :)
2394 2018-09-19 18:36:32 Atrupek@gmail.com it was the schererville indiana location. Missing items, wrong sauce on wife’s boneless. Our 50 bone in were very under sauced, full or bare spots and the wings tasted terrible. Old dirty fryer oil. $79 and some chance and every aspect of the meal was terrible.
2395 2018-09-19 18:36:27 Cilantro & truffle oil just smells so good

2398 2018-09-19 18:36:19 UPDATE: The incident at Pioneer school today happened when new heating units were being used for the first time. As the oil coating burned off the unit it caused some smoke in one classroom, says @BoiseFire. Evacuations lasted less than 30 min.
2399 2018-09-19 18:36:12 Thank you for turning a spotlight on this cynical, scandalous, evil. Doubtless, the US wants to hand Syria over to the Sunni rebels to satisfy Sunni Saudi Arabia on which US depends for oil  and for jobs in armaments sales. It also satisfies Israel which wants Syria annihilated.

2401 2018-09-19 18:36:02 So there’s a cute rodeo boy in the oil change place and when they asked me what oil I wanted & didn’t know, he laughed at me
2402 2018-09-19 18:36:00 "Congressman, we want to drill for oil in Teddy Roosevelt's head."
2403 2018-09-19 18:35:58 It turns out hand sanitizer does not get olive oil off your hands. This message brought to you by the guys who accidentally broke the water main.
2404 2018-09-19 18:35:55 I get them on my cartilage by my industrial all the time & tea tree oil works like a charm
2405 2018-09-19 18:35:50 When you’re forced to watch CNN at the dealership while you’re waiting for an oil change.. 
2406 2018-09-19 18:35:46 I can change a tire. I can change my oil. Hell, I can put a battery in my car too. Lol my uncle use to build cars & houses from scratch so I better had learned something from him.
2407 2018-09-19 18:35:45 Did you know that if you cover kale in coconut oil it's easier to scrape into the trash can.

2412 2018-09-19 18:34:53  me, it’s day 3, went to bed at 5 just taken the night time tablets and dowsed myself in eau d olbas oil. Currently on top of duvet as I’m roasting few minutes and I’ll be under it shivering 
2413 2018-09-19 18:34:48 When the last time you had a oil change
2414 2018-09-19 18:34:44 i need an oil change and a car wash
2415 2018-09-19 18:34:32 Cilantro & Truffle Oil are my weird aphrodisiacs 
2416 2018-09-19 18:34:30 We're talking about action they could have taken to mitigate the oil industry crisis.
They ban fracking for example, an industry that could employ thousands of oil industry former staff and generate massive wealth for the economy.
2417 2018-09-19 18:34:24 I will try those out! I love oil pulling too!
2418 2018-09-19 18:34:19 Extra virgin olive oil
2419 2018-09-19 18:34:18 They do! Even the ones that pound the foundation. I've gotten hold of some faces of people who sleep in make-up. You wouldn't believe the gunk that comes out of their pores. It's all dead skin, oil and make-up.
2420 2018-09-19 18:34:12 Manafort and Podesta were paid by Yakunovych to help him as successful lobbyists and influencers.

2429 2018-09-19 18:33:04 I came to get my oil changed by myself and the guy asked me if I want the same as last time and I’m like ??????? There’s different kinds ?

2431 2018-09-19 18:33:01 One Q I’m left asking after @BIEE10 is what is the oil & gas majors strategy? 

Their move towards EV charging is mysterious. For vert integrated companies, supporting transition away from ICE to EVs cannibalises market assuming power gen becomes low-carbon. 

So what’s the plan?
2432 2018-09-19 18:32:55 Wheat, Barley, Oil seed rape, lamb, honey. Lambs the biggest worry for me a lot is exported to France no deal means a 15% tariff .
2433 2018-09-19 18:32:22 Oh yeah I used to be a part of that world. But they dont make any bones about being feminists. Advertising has fake woke bros and men sitting in a discussion surrounded by women talking about women's hair oil and not even letting them talk or asking them how they feel.
2434 2018-09-19 18:32:13 The product is fake too. It just a soap making kit you can buy anywhere with some vitamin oil in it
2435 2018-09-19 18:32:11 Save up to extra 10% on diapers, shampoo, powder, oil, wipes and more from top brands....
2436 2018-09-19 18:31:50 The oil machine has gel again.I can't wait for the 10th of october @SuperSportTV @ThatoMoeng @PiratesForum @orlandopirates @KaizerChiefs #ssDiski
2437 2018-09-19 18:31:50 Don’t be Chelsea don’t go a whole year without an oil change
2438 2018-09-19 18:31:22 Why the Congress introduced Petro Bond to make us - Diwala like Paki? Had the Congress paid all dues to IRAN - during U.S Sanction period? Why not cost was realized from oil users? Congress supporters were using most of oil, others were poor.

2443 2018-09-19 18:30:48 Hmmm....I think trying to create affordable clean, green energy (no byproducts from photons) is different than helping subsidy the trillions for oil companies which helps bolster up climate damage.
2444 2018-09-19 18:30:47 ok mommas i need you opinion:
what did you use during your pregnancy for stretchmarks/ itchiness??? i’ve been using baby oil gel but it’s not doing the trick anymore 
2445 2018-09-19 18:30:43 At xmas they would know it's name, now they just know the farmer, & the fish, the captain. All shocking to a bloke from Brum! Olive oil!! Isn't that what you put in your ears? & now some want to divorce us from those enthusiasms.

2452 2018-09-19 18:30:05 vegetable oil, mostly?

I know there's some milk solids in most of it as I had to try to find a vegan version when cooking for friends
2453 2018-09-19 18:30:03 It’s canola oil that merely tastes like butter & and since it’s in an aerosol spray you don’t have to use as much.
2454 2018-09-19 18:29:58 Take care of your eyebrows

2471 2018-09-19 18:27:47 No deal then. You can pay full price for oil, electricity, water and everything else you have gotten at a discount. We will suffer short term and expand our markets. And we will never forget how you treat your allies or that you deal in bad faith. #bye
2472 2018-09-19 18:27:45 Or i like to make my own. And it feels super great! Just put on a cap and sit. 

Avocado, egg yolk, honey, essential oil (coconut, jojoba, evoo, or jbco) mayo, banana and aloe...
2473 2018-09-19 18:27:37 In Africa many countries depend on agriculture and natural resources such as oil and gas, tourism, etc. So I think in order to grow Angola's economy as it was previously, it is necessary for countries to be use properly its resource for the public interest. - "Thought"
2474 2018-09-19 18:27:35 Right okay, why can't it? What's the difference between money made from oil, or let's take Real Madrid for example, money lent to them by their own banks?
2475 2018-09-19 18:27:34 The article basically says bankruptcies, mergers, & business transformations. When the oil crash happened, the money and skilled business leaders turned to other markets & industries. The article specifically speaks to how one transformed into cannibis grow op. #NewEconomy
2476 2018-09-19 18:27:20 I love getting out the shower and rubbing my body down in oil, it’d be nice if I had a lil boo thang to do it for me though 
2477 2018-09-19 18:27:08 I've tried a few different versions. The best recipe I found so far is super simple - you just blend the avocado up with lemon, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper and a bit of liquid (I think they used cream in the recipe, but I just use pasta water) and then you can add toppings
2478 2018-09-19 18:27:08 alive oil is life. my laptop runs on that instead of electricity
2479 2018-09-19 18:27:07 How tf has oil money got to do with anything, are you 12?
2480 2018-09-19 18:27:04 Applied vinegar on my shoes again. Worked rather well. But while waiting for the vinegar to dry. before I break out the neatfoot oil, I will go across town for some frigging fish and chips! :)

Dunno what neatfoot oil might make me long for for dinner... :D
2481 2018-09-19 18:26:31 Not just you! I’m fairly certain I’m slowly poisoning myself with bug spray. I have also mixed a blend of peppermint oil (insects/rodents don’t like the smell) mixed w/ water + little dishwashing soap and spraying in corners/along baseboards. Safer for pets and kids.
2482 2018-09-19 18:26:29 You can get cod liver oil tablets which is what i take and you dont get any of the foul taste but yeah anything to get the omega 3
2483 2018-09-19 18:26:16 You should drink some raspberry leaf tea to help him come or some castor oil
2484 2018-09-19 18:26:13 Spilt hot oil on my leg today, kill me

2488 2018-09-19 18:25:55 Bottling 3 cups of a new batch of Oil. Found that Glycerin is not great for the purpose I had so moved to a MCT/EVCO 2:1 ratio and it seems much better for silky consistency and more geared for topical use.
2489 2018-09-19 18:25:46 How and when? Tell me let me give it to you in grand style but on this debt issue, too many misinformation. Truth of the matter is GEJ govt borrowed a lot as well despite selling oil for armed robber prices in 4yrs. Also rmbr Kemi did more internationl bonds for the cheaper rates

2536 2018-09-19 18:20:00 I don’t blame any1 who’s w/o $ or work. In 1970 Nixon took us off the gold standard & tied the $ to the price of oil. Since then inflation has shot up like crazy, as u can c online. Then  NAFTA in 1994. These & other gvt policies have kept us all down, & it’s getting worse.

Put in a cup with honey and a little bit of coconut oil. Its not that good tasting but work wonders. Thyme helps opening up airways and soothes a sore throat
2573 2018-09-19 18:16:30 It is a horrifying truth that the AngloAmerican Empire makes Assad and Gaddafi look like the good guys in comparison. The West's constant funding and arming of terrorist groups and the war crimes of bombing and invading nations on behalf of oil companies is shameful.

2631 2018-09-19 18:08:25 Well, steeped in water would give you a nice aroma and taste but not necessarily a high. Best if the THC is bonded with a fat, so some heat the leaves first in a tiny bit of butter or oil first. I find it works with a "fatty milk" too (not to mention it tastes better lol)

2645 2018-09-19 18:06:53 I use a oil diffuser and put in a mix of relaxing oils including lavender. The calm sound of the machine helps me sleep too! A bit of white noise. Also I read manga in bed or play iPad games to make me more sleepy.
2646 2018-09-19 18:06:43 and if an oil tanker crashes into your bridge?
2647 2018-09-19 18:06:40 Understood but be careful with judging others based on something you're passionate about. by the way...science is real!!! you'd still be a caveman with a stone hammer without it! Texas has successfully propagandized yall in favor of big oil monopolization. A damn shame!!
2648 2018-09-19 18:06:37 私どっちかというと使う側になるかな。

2653 2018-09-19 18:06:18 They poisoned me for over 20 years for profit, 22 different synthetic prescriptions. Never was asked about diet. Turns out I have an endocannbinoid deficiency and stomach problems from autism. Medicaid won't cover the one thing that helps, even CBD oil.  Pure torture.
2654 2018-09-19 18:06:11 A lie detector is fucking snake oil anyway. Too many ways for it to be wrong and ya still up to a person to interpret it.

2679 2018-09-19 18:02:53 @officialcarrey If u have back pain please know that u don't have to take prescription drugs, they only hide the underlying problem with your back. Dr. Mercola has Krill Oil or Salmon Oil that can help u. How can someone like you that has so much money not know this information?
2680 2018-09-19 18:02:44 I am intrigued by this! Do you have an oil you'd recommend for someone who likes warm and spicy sort of scents?

2685 2018-09-19 18:01:44 I think as a technology it will be useful but as the foundation for a currency it’s snake oil. It looks like a great way to validate and record peer to peer transactions but it’s being shoved into realms there it’s the wrong tool.

2702 2018-09-19 18:00:12 If it is the first time in history this has happened  it’s only because there were no container ships plying their trade in the arctic at the time that it was covered in the vast swathes of vegetation which led to the huge oil reserves under the snow.

Already there have been conflicts over fresh water. Look at the Golan Heights in the Middle East.......

2718 2018-09-19 17:58:32 And cheaper oil.
2719 2018-09-19 17:58:25 My point is, no matter how many trophies your oil money buys you, you’ll never be a big club. And you know it too.

2742 2018-09-19 17:56:22 Or maybe it simply shows the increase price of oil & gas is accelerating Manufacturing output and employment.  (You see this 2012 - early 2014 in the Obama years.)  So it is the same coin of why real wages have decreased since January 2017 as energy prices have outpaced wages.

2818 2018-09-19 17:47:42 Remind me Cameron, in the white paper how much tax from oil did Alex Salmond rely on for this year? How much will we raise? How much would that have been per person in extra tax to cover the shortfall each year?

2848 2018-09-19 17:44:36 What writers such as this completely miss is that production of all oil & gas wells declines over time so, without new drilling, the taxes will also decline.  Plus, industry pays taxes on the drilling rigs and other equip that will go away.   Just like any other industry, money..

2905 2018-09-19 17:38:16 Worst Thing for Petroleum companies that they have buy crude price in higher rate and this is only due Ban in Iran. @realDonaldTrump  You have take some measures to reduce the rate of cude oil so oil companies can sell petrol in lower price to common people.
2906 2018-09-19 17:38:11 Finally, take any oils that are supposed vegetable oils out of your kitchen. Replace them with olive oil, avocado oil, and pure lard (not hydrogenated).

Eat fresh or flash frozen green, leafy or cruciferous vegetables and high fat meats and cheeses. 

Feel free to research this.

2919 2018-09-19 17:36:34 Gov Jerry Brown has approved 233 permits for oil companies to drill in state waters, within 3miles of the CA coast. While the gov complains about fed offshore drilling and President Trump, he controls four times as many wells in state waters than Trump controls in federal waters
2920 2018-09-19 17:36:29 The corridor leading to faslane is 1 mile wide, less in places. Ridiculous idea. Imagine nukes and oil fields in the Thames, around Westminster. That's the equivalent
2921 2018-09-19 17:36:28 Oh come on they are really good. Roasted with olive oil fantastic.
2922 2018-09-19 17:36:22 Yes my time is quantfiably more valuable and more scarce than most claiming they lack the time to wash and reuse dishes.  I have 4 kids. I value the environment more than others’ perceived convenience. I’d like to not subsidize their oil addiction.

2925 2018-09-19 17:35:56 There's far more upside potential than downside risk in a Platinum right now. I'm cost averaging every couple of weeks. Mostly in Silver though. Wow at $14 and a 80+ gold to silver ratio. sooooo undervalued. 2nd most useful commodity after oil. And becoming the most useful

2935 2018-09-19 17:35:00 Hmm. #KnuteBuehler was for a price on pollution & Clean Energy Jobs before he was against it. What's changed? Looking for big oil donations? Trying to live up to his F rating from @OLCV? Knute is NOT for a #CleanEnergyFuture. @KateBrownForOR is.

2946 2018-09-19 17:33:21 lucky for them it's not the wettest from the standpoint of olive oil or mucous or something equally difficult to clean up.
2947 2018-09-19 17:33:16 maybe a cbd oil can help you!
2948 2018-09-19 17:33:12 How about the one in north houston with creepy oil rig mannequins positioned in the ceiling? What a treat.
2949 2018-09-19 17:33:09 A pipeline that you favour is a scandal when your opponents use it? Your support for unlimited increase in the dirty oil is not a scandal but support for a smaller increase is.  Your world is a topsy-turvy one.

2962 2018-09-19 17:31:56 I couldn’t agree more! Having a child is like causing an oil spill. Damning to the environment. Parents breed to “keep up w the Joneses,” then want everyone to feel sorry for the misery they caused themselves by giving them a medal. No.

2991 2018-09-19 17:29:11 I'm not praising Aregbe but we must take cognizance of the fact that he's constrained by monies he's borrowed to drive infrastructure, fall in oil prices and low IGR, the best he could do in the moment was to modulate the salary so as to pay those who earned less exact amount
2992 2018-09-19 17:29:08 What do these war hawks think they can achieve by warring with Iran? Is this still all about oil? Their world view has failed repeatedly over my lifetime. When do we stop them?
2993 2018-09-19 17:29:01 The tax bill reduced corporate taxes from the highest in the developed world to about average (like Sweden); turned us into a territorial tax system (like the rest of the world); and opened Anwar for oil expiration.

3061 2018-09-19 17:22:39 Went to get my oil changed and they hit me with you need new breaks, it'll be $419 like wtf
3062 2018-09-19 17:22:27 i use tea tree oil in my hair and it’s literally a godsend, never thought to use it for my acne though. i’m definitely gonna pick these up give them a try! :)
3063 2018-09-19 17:22:20 Yep :) 
The oil in the cleanser with attract the oil in your skin, making your oil production more regulated
3064 2018-09-19 17:22:09 Grapeseed oil is very good for treating acne or any sort of scars & tightens the pores. Highly recommend it. I apply it to my face directly. I just got jojoba oil too. I add 5-6 drops to my water once a day. Combination of both on daily basis
3065 2018-09-19 17:22:09 Love the oil painting look!  I use a magnifier...my #paintedrocks are small!
3066 2018-09-19 17:22:09 That the definition of Resist
3067 2018-09-19 17:22:04 There was no disrespect in my question to you. When I hear you on TV it seems that you now back the gas increases we get from the excuses the oil companies give. When I first saw you on TV you slammed the companies for raising the gas prices. I do thank you.
3068 2018-09-19 17:22:01 ふざけろwwww

3069 2018-09-19 17:21:51 What, are other countries somehow not allowed to compete in an area if the United States is competing there already too? Also, do you think just maybe Downer chatted you up about oil because that's your specialty, not for some sinister reason?
3070 2018-09-19 17:21:48 my dad works at an oil & gas company called Nippon and told me engineers here earn Rm 11,500 daily.

 RM 340, 000/ Monthly
The harder the skill, the greater the pay 
3071 2018-09-19 17:21:37 Glad we're in Canada and he only had access to bear spray from Canadian Tire and not an AK-47, "free with oil change".
3072 2018-09-19 17:21:35 too much oil into her ass....jajaja
3073 2018-09-19 17:21:17 can you roast frozen veg? Like could I just stick a bunch of frozen veg, tossed in oil and salt, under the broiler and get something tasty?
3074 2018-09-19 17:21:15 Oh, I forgot that nobody has ever, ever lied to his therapist—telling, by the way, a substantially different story—or claimed that they “welcome investigation,” like someone huckstering snake oil.
3075 2018-09-19 17:20:47 Wall Street and corporate America are a far more real threat to American democracy (or, what’s left of it).

“Russia” is just a convenient excuse that they’re using to distract you from genuine dangers, such as the oil and gas industry, defense industry, large banks, etc.
3076 2018-09-19 17:20:36 Now, you may inherit a fortune from your parents.

Or marry into a fortune.

Or strike a natural fortune. (Gold, diamond, oil, lottery)

Or make a fortune by sheer grit.

Or receive a fortune. Charity, philanthropy, or State support.

Or never get a fortune, however hard you try.

3081 2018-09-19 17:19:32 I finally have large tubes of primary colors in both acrylic and oil paint plus a watercolor travel set (that has a brush pen that holds the water for you) I'm so excited to do all of the art it's such a soothing hobby for me 
3082 2018-09-19 17:19:28 It's fucking backward. The Dems are snake oil salesman, albeit not very good ones.

3090 2018-09-19 17:18:35 Since in Office, Trump has removed regulations: preventing dumping oil/coal sludge into streams; requiring low emissions-vehicles & coal; preventing use of public lands4 mining/drilling-I know I'm missing some.  But all of these regulations had a beneficial effect on environment.
3091 2018-09-19 17:18:33 Hear me out. Hummus pizza. Pita bread with hummus spread, olive oil and veggies. A hummus-pizza. A humzah
3092 2018-09-19 17:18:23 Your oil will run dry and your engine will lock up and not start causing major problems and costing way more to fix than just getting the oil changed 
3093 2018-09-19 17:18:22 Australian oil company, woodside, was actively competing with American oil companies trying to do business in Israel and Cyprus. I was advising American companies at the time. No wonder Downer wanted to talk oil in London and then began recording me with his phone. Set up.
3094 2018-09-19 17:18:19 I think it was partly the oil he got covered in...
3095 2018-09-19 17:18:16 Powder on my chest oil on my neck

3097 2018-09-19 17:18:08 Bozos? I assume I’m included. Yeah, his handling of Garza & statement about overruling the law is pretty jarring but I’m an environmentalist and his views on climate damage protection (wait, let me guess-you think climate is weather) is pro the welfare queens called Big Oil so 
3098 2018-09-19 17:17:55 Fuckin is get to the toilet fast  I can’t put my boots on n oil

Send me money if you do.

3101 2018-09-19 17:17:29 Chef Ramses cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with Silly Putty.
3102 2018-09-19 17:17:08 Very simple: 1 grated squash, 1 portion boiled couscous, 2 finely chopped garlic pieces, 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons flour. Mix it all in a bowl, season. Then pan-fry spoon-sized cakes 3 mins on each side in oil. Delicious :)
3103 2018-09-19 17:16:52 今日は何もできてない気がするが、まぁいいかｗ
3104 2018-09-19 17:16:48 I believe that Tesla doesn’t advertise and that luxury car companies spend between 1k and 4K per unit sold on media buys. Gas/oil, meh it’s days are numbered regardless of Tesla - there are no new markets for fossil energy opening up, zero.

3107 2018-09-19 17:16:22 You best believe if I manage to straighten and tame my curls, that I will not wash it until the damn US of A tries to destabilize and invade my hair for its oil.
3108 2018-09-19 17:16:00 Whats your address? I have an oil that works wonders for mine that I'll send over
3109 2018-09-19 17:15:48 ooo i’m definitely gonna have to get the tea tree oil mask!! my face has recently become severely acne prone so i’m in need of something to clear it up. thanks for the reccomendation!!
3110 2018-09-19 17:15:40 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
3111 2018-09-19 17:15:19 Just wanted to share a lil something that I learned in bio with y’all coconut oil is not a healthier alternative to cook with than butter. It’s actually higher in saturated fat. Avocado oil or olive oil has unsaturated fat & are a couple of the actual healthier options

3118 2018-09-19 17:14:12 Actions speak louder than words

Y’all say your against them all, but only organize folks locally against renewable projects

You seem to write extensively about abolishing renewable subsidies, but oil/gas specific subsidies don’t seem to make the cut

Words don’t equal actions
3119 2018-09-19 17:14:02 いいなぁ…。小さい方が100円で売られてる程度しか安売り見たことない
3120 2018-09-19 17:13:59 Comfort and Trump. The oil and water of our new reality.
3121 2018-09-19 17:13:59 I tried it for oil cleansing and honestly, I feel like it gave me more acne. I have oily, acne prone skin. It left my skin feeling more textured.
3122 2018-09-19 17:13:47 Facts hurt your logic and you’re giving Brooklyn a bad name.
3123 2018-09-19 17:13:45 I need somebody to oil my scalp

3125 2018-09-19 17:13:34 If China will get 1  mil bpd oil from Venny what does Cuba get? How much more oil will be produced with China help and at what price sold ? Pays old debt or what?interesting questions.

3127 2018-09-19 17:13:29 The beard oil is affordable and the scents are amazing.

 Bitch you know I’m shining 
3129 2018-09-19 17:13:18 1. You actually look really good. 2. You really should try coconut oil for your scalp, I bet it's pretty dry. 3. Oh but I love your hair so short! 4. Have you tried going vegan? It can cure other diseases... 
3130 2018-09-19 17:13:16 I’m too lazy to go back to the supermarket to get oil
3131 2018-09-19 17:13:08 Yes, along with olives in oil and sticky toffee pudding. We are now very very hungry.
3132 2018-09-19 17:13:07 It is. What should I bathe it with?  Tea tree oil or just let it dry?
3133 2018-09-19 17:12:52 I’m going to get an oil change today but it’s so bad I know they are gonna yell at me like last time 
3134 2018-09-19 17:12:46 The Mag'har - the only race in the history of WoW that invented tanning oil before shirts.
3135 2018-09-19 17:12:38 peanut butter is chock full of oil.. much in the same way we are full of accountability, in case you were wondering
3136 2018-09-19 17:12:35 #palm oil# Thornton’s chocolates ! Don’t regularly shop at Thornton’s BUT how disappointing, didn’t realise palm oil is used in their choccies until I went to buy today - good job I checked the ingredients -result - no purchase!
3137 2018-09-19 17:12:24 Wanna eat a salad?  why not use olive oil dressing instead of regular ranch or cream.. it’s healthier.
3138 2018-09-19 17:12:23 How did i come home without getting cooking oil  i want fried chicken
3139 2018-09-19 17:11:58 Hmm.... A little massage oil and an hour or two to help you work on those kinks sounds perfect.
3140 2018-09-19 17:11:47 i have oil stains in my shirt for eating a lot of freshly cooked bacon

3145 2018-09-19 17:10:52 I'm a fan of the Matiz Gallego sardines in olive oil. Although they're best fresh and grilled over grape vines. Preferably in Positano.
3146 2018-09-19 17:10:48 Which part of that report addresses oil subsidies? Serious question. I glanced at it, and couldn't find any.
3147 2018-09-19 17:10:44 Can I ask what the difference is between the oil they are trying to be prescribed and the stuff we can all buy. Is it the higher THC content.
3148 2018-09-19 17:10:43 箱買い…。どうしてそんなことに…
わたしもそんな贅沢が許されたい
3149 2018-09-19 17:10:35 Роснефть (как пример) -госкорпорация,долги есть.   На июль2018 «Роснефтегазу» принадлежит 50% акций,британской BP —19,75 %,швейцарско-катарскому QHG Oil Ventures —19,5%. Т.е. долг РФ по Роснефти уменьшаем min на 39,25%?!) Но глупый одеситушка суммирует все на РФ. И так во всем)

3152 2018-09-19 17:10:10 Might be a good idea to find a stronger term than “scandal” in this case. Voters might be growing numb to the word and, if investigated, probably amounts to corruption of some sort. (See gov’t relationship with foreign oil interests and rail companies.) #cdnpoli #liberano

3154 2018-09-19 17:09:59 So it was damaged by oil and people using it? What does that say about the future use!There's oil spills everyday on our roads
3155 2018-09-19 17:09:53 Everytime i go in for an oil change they have a list that is over 2k in total

Not to mention a recurring problem on Outbacks that i stall if i brake to hard.  That alone i heard is a 2k repair.
3156 2018-09-19 17:09:53 Dear @realDonaldTrump, sincere congratulation on Strategic partnership with Poles! With such a low unemployment rate, why not to open your market for skilled Polish specialists to support you in Texas' Oil&Gas?
3157 2018-09-19 17:09:39 He really thinks the guy would get to keep the boat.
After all , shouldn't we have taken kept Iran's oil.

3159 2018-09-19 17:09:22 Burning the midnight oil on a tender response in the office before hitting some (hopefully quieter) motorways. At least there's @Interpol live on @BBC6Music to keep me company in the empty office!!
3160 2018-09-19 17:09:12 You honestly think he cares.   He’s trying to turn the media from all the hot oil he’s in

あとインヒビター壊されそうなのに1st、2ndタワーにスプリットしてる奴も、、
3162 2018-09-19 17:09:03 Differin gel at night. Use with a moisturizer like oil of Olay in case u have sensitive skin. Use ur facial cleanser ( Again oil of olay look for an oil friendly one, or Neutrogena) before putting on the gel. Dont miss a night cuz one or two surface whiteheads gon pop up.
3163 2018-09-19 17:09:02 そんな贅沢、神への冒涜に近い。
流石にそんな野蛮な行為は真似できなかった
3164 2018-09-19 17:08:59 I'd say it's @jkenney doing damage control by presenting the benefits of using ethical Alberta oil to the Indian government. Dispelling the lies, misinformation and propaganda spread by anti-Canadian oil activists (many of whom are now AB NDP MLAs) is a good thing
3165 2018-09-19 17:08:15 @petreleaf where can I buy your dog cbd oil locally???

3167 2018-09-19 17:07:55 So do producers get a “relief package” from ridiculous @EPA policy of giving out more waivers?!?!?!? Crop prices already suffering from trade policy, now will be suffering from demand destruction created by our own gov’t agency, which ironically means we burn more polluting oil.

3170 2018-09-19 17:07:21 The spread between the UK standard oil contract (Brent) and US equivalent (WTI) has dropped to $8.53. That is the biggest drop in the disparity since Aug 20
3171 2018-09-19 17:07:20 Dropped off my car for an oil change, walked down the street to Checkers, ordered, discovered I've left my wallet either in the car or at home- checkers people immediately are like "no worries you can just have it we got you" and then someone told me nice kicks so today is rad
3172 2018-09-19 17:07:07 McLeod has looked great for the Oil so far in preseason.  Stood out among rookies along with Yamamoto and Benson, smart guy who’s wheeling in a big way to introduce himself to the Oil faithful.  I’m excited to see more.
3173 2018-09-19 17:07:04 周回しなきゃ
3174 2018-09-19 17:06:53 Wouldn't hurt to modernize the infrastructure supporting those rail cars. More product needs to be moved, especially now for farmers. 

Oil doesn't need to be imported. A $2B per refinery Coker investment can refine oilsands.

An investment in #BitumenBalls tech = safe transport.
3175 2018-09-19 17:06:52 See now there is another mistake by Kerri's campaign. she removed the tweet telling government it is not big oil that needs money instead of simply tweeting that she misread the tweet.
3176 2018-09-19 17:06:51 うわ、もう2時すぎてんの？ヤバ
3177 2018-09-19 17:06:49 Me too. It's absolutely horrid. It's like the chicken was dipped in car oil

3179 2018-09-19 17:06:40 Lots of green vegetables, water. I'm also big on oils; olive oil, coconut oil and then Shea butter all from Dischem. oh... and i also braid my hair often.

3184 2018-09-19 17:05:44 Actually the longs  believe in conspiracy theories; big oil, car companies, the media all conspiring against $TSLA. I simply believe Elon committed securities fraud all on his own. As for yuor negative margins, they speak for themselves. Yes i know, wait till they ramp lol
3185 2018-09-19 17:05:13 I filled up my tank, took my car to get washed and I also got an oil change and it’s barely 10am! Feeling super productive today l

3196 2018-09-19 17:04:27 Taking a vehicle to get an oil change is like going to the doctor. They are going to find something wrong with it.
3197 2018-09-19 17:04:16 Lol wow i need an oil change too but I’m not posting my dashboard thinking I’m hard cause I’m driving on Snapchat mfs kill me

3202 2018-09-19 17:03:41 trying cbd oil to see if it helps me with recovery and lessens my anxiety  so gonna do a thread on how it goes
3203 2018-09-19 17:03:36 You, Koen Swinkle, have clearly figured it out better than the joint UN - OPCW report. They were trying to mislead all of us, obviously as part of some Rothschild oil company conspiracy. I rescind my previous tweets. Thanks so much, detective.
3204 2018-09-19 17:03:35 Remove Big Oil subsidies and let gas prices rise like EU, EV's both commercial and consumer will take off.  Will drive solar / wind down even further.  Most people should have access to personal or community solar with battery storage then
3205 2018-09-19 17:03:24 No the country that is not supply Arms to Saudi Arabia at $525b and the one that trades with 36 states under a 30 year old trade agreement. The only other democracy with water, oil and mineral resources in abundance.

3209 2018-09-19 17:02:51 You think oil companies and private industry care about ethics? That's adorable.

And you think country's buy oil and not private enterprise? That's also adorable.

3211 2018-09-19 17:02:31 I got my IUD out yesterday & was so nervous about the pain I took three times the recommended amount of CBD oil & then the pronox (laughing gas) they offered me once I actually got to the doctors & inadvertently got high out of my mind which wouldn’t have been a problem but
3212 2018-09-19 17:02:30 “The squeaky wheel gets the oil. Too much squeak gets replaced”
3213 2018-09-19 17:02:22 I’ve used their products before ! They’re bomb. They only make stuff like bath bombs and lip scrub but they have an oil tincture that works too!
3214 2018-09-19 17:02:22 Have you tried CBD oil? I hear it's amazing for pain & possibly nerve regeneration.I think Back pain is worse than labor bc atleast labor ends..bp never does. Had a herniated disc once..hang in there!

3216 2018-09-19 17:02:09 Waiting while getting an oil change with 'Hot Bench' on TV a gentlemen who owns a roofing company engaged me in conversation after a political ad...

"I'm voting Republican all the time now. Trump is a total screw up, but the economy is great. I have more business than ever."
3217 2018-09-19 17:02:02 My oil tank has sprung a leak and I smell like a petrol statuon.
3218 2018-09-19 17:01:51 I sell organic oil for skin/ hair care nd organic black soap very affordable.
3219 2018-09-19 17:01:50 My synthetic oil change was free. Match that? And I’m yours.
3220 2018-09-19 17:01:45 It’s obscene Ont & Que Dairy Corps can hold Canada hostage in NAFTA talks & potentially cost Canadians billions
Remember Ont & Que prefer Tanker Oil from Arab Sheiks, Venezuela’s Killer Dictator,Africa & USA rather than Canadian Pipeline Oil while taking Alberta Equalization
3221 2018-09-19 17:01:45 Yet, here you are, using a barrel of oil to send this message to me...
3222 2018-09-19 17:01:43 Seriously...???   Sara is great and your negative comments are so shallow - you Trumpers are goofy in the head...
3223 2018-09-19 17:01:42 One thing the new #dagga law helps with is that it makes growing canabis for private medicinal reasons legal and therefor more affordable. One months Quality CBD oil costs R1000. How much cheaper can you do it yourself? If you don’t know about CBD, do some research of it vs THC.
3224 2018-09-19 17:01:39 Someone needs to hear this today: Go get your oil changed. It's a whole lot cheaper than a new car.

Yay, Dad moments.
3225 2018-09-19 17:01:38 Went to get my oil changed, got like 10 different recommendations on things my car needs. Left with only an oil change. 
3226 2018-09-19 17:01:38 Oil is worth 1.2. Billion to Scotland  , that's sweetie money to Germany .

3232 2018-09-19 17:01:20 At an oil and gas conference in Houston this morning. Male delegate stops me and says, "You're a little media person, aren't ya." Why do some men think it is okay to talk to women like this in a professional setting?

3235 2018-09-19 17:00:56 Management/leadership is the the oil in an engine.  It has to be changed periodically or the engine will break down.  Even the best oil loses is effectiveness.
3236 2018-09-19 17:00:55 Just had a look on Wiki, it looks great! Two World Heritage sites, a little known province and lots of olive oil. Plus all that sunshine, I’d start booking!

3245 2018-09-19 17:00:22 The diluent is condensate and is easily separated.  It's just an issue of being able to refine bitumin which is a heavy oil.  

Currently the Louisiana gulf coast and California are the closest refinery markets for heavy oil.

3251 2018-09-19 16:59:52 @JohnKasich please do your own research on CBD oil & don't listen to those that are against it. It helps so many & you don't get high from it! THC amounts are trace, if any at all. Please, allow it to help. It's so much better than rx drugs & greatly reduces the need for opiates.
3252 2018-09-19 16:59:52 お許しください！なんでもしますから！

3256 2018-09-19 16:59:22 We don't use Refined Oil at all, it's Kachi Ghani or Double Filtered.
Ghee always.
3257 2018-09-19 16:59:13 Nothing like one of Trump cabinet enriching big gas and oil on tax payers dime
3258 2018-09-19 16:59:11 I know when i bring up “medical marijuana” people think just buds and wax, but we legit make real medicine at the company i work with we coming out with suppositories, and its full spectrum cannabis oil for healing not a high. #HealTheNation
3259 2018-09-19 16:59:07 Believe me, I'm going through the same stuff. Dysphoria means I need stuff like my beard oil and cologne to feel like A Man. And that's hard. But it's taking care of my psyche and my soul. Which is what matters more than anything else.

May the day be easy and meaningful. 
3260 2018-09-19 16:59:06 Bitches love sending that  when you tell em you just got out the shower. Bitch whatchu looking for? I gotta put this lotion/oil on and you tryna see some dick. Stop texting me.

Olive oil. What were you thinking?
3266 2018-09-19 16:58:36 And the Gulf Oil was that weak too? Your club has been a play thing for the IRA for years I know members in and around Chorlton who are still involved.
3267 2018-09-19 16:58:34 Oh my seems like the oil money just gone and done a madness, now I have to start watching again
3268 2018-09-19 16:58:30 We could keep it in the ground and eliminate the risks entirely.  To meet our climate targets, this is what we must do.  Lets retrain workers for jobs in renewables. Oil & gas is a dying industry, and we need to look forward, for everyone!
3269 2018-09-19 16:58:26 ไม่สนใจหรอก นอนดีกว่าาา จริงๆยังไม่ง่วงเลย555
3270 2018-09-19 16:58:23 We can sell them our oil while using the profits to develop nuclear...a win win!
3271 2018-09-19 16:58:23 How is your funding from the oil companies holding up? How is your years of misinformation and lying carrying? 45 nations have Carbon pricing and around thirty subnational bodies. All are doing very well. Most better than Canada and the USA. Growing faster and better life.
3272 2018-09-19 16:58:21 ...and we are promised in Isaiah 61:3 “...beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness”.  This can only come about thru healing and restoration for everyone - and this requires forgiveness & prayer.

3279 2018-09-19 16:57:47 CBD oil is life!
3280 2018-09-19 16:57:44 It would have been a leap forward if exact match was limited to plural/singular & misspellings.  I saw already completely irrelevant results! Like 'oil heater' triggering 'gas heater'.
3281 2018-09-19 16:57:38 So the story isn't so much PB increases, which wouldn't reflect the true chg YoY as pickup in gas gen is met by oil sands co-gen. Coal Gen is down 2-3 GW YoY, which gas has filled in for. Not being a dick, just a lot of the market gets run over at AECO due to misunderstanding
3282 2018-09-19 16:57:35 Looks like you followed Oil's advice
3283 2018-09-19 16:57:33 Nah. I'm a Petroleum Engineering student on Industrial training in a quality assurance/quality check laboratory department of a private oil servicing company. No way in hell anyone could ever guess that from the pic.

3295 2018-09-19 16:55:54 Ranukaji, I am with you on this, it's far fetched to believe that CONgi can influence strength of USD and oil prices. That requires enormous connections and capital/funds. If someone has all that, why would they use it to influence Indian elections?

3339 2018-09-19 16:50:31 Any fuel made from crude oil is carcinogenic when burnt.  funny how  we're all concentrating on diesel though.

 ~the diesel particulate filter~ made toxic particulates smaller & easier to inhale.

3380 2018-09-19 16:47:04 The smart thing for Ford to do would have been to let the election take place without interference, take the time to properly research a bill to reduce council, then have a special election with the new boundaries. But that would have required maturity.

3406 2018-09-19 16:44:24 2/ Problem is, there is no fair market so long as there are oil subsidies. Your framing of the issues is biased. Instead of attacking renewables, propose steps that will insure free and fair competition in the energy market.
3407 2018-09-19 16:44:15 Not really allergic anymore and they use hot pressed oil so the proteins gone.

Out of salad dressing and vinegar, too? Just substitute lemon juice for the vinegar and mix with olive or vegetable oil and add your favorite herbs and/or spice
3411 2018-09-19 16:44:00 @tvcnewsng Kidnapping seems to be d 'oil boom' for robbers. It started from the south, but sadly now gaining momentum in the north. Robbers now relish picking people at little or no risk than taking up arms as robbers. Govt must do more of intelligence. #JH
3412 2018-09-19 16:43:57 It seems to me you are correct Did this other person even  read the article at all, it is funded by the oil company the government isn't giving them money, at least that is what it looks like to me

3438 2018-09-19 16:41:19 A sensible person would cut out those foods but considering I deal with awful cramps from cheese nothing deters me from anything. Plus tomatoes is one of them and toms with 986433 garlic cloves and an obscene amount of olive oil is my comfort food so no
3439 2018-09-19 16:41:10 Through globalization

Colombians import US shows, tvs, phones, cars, candy, computers, internet services

3441 2018-09-19 16:41:01 Cosrx lotion w/ birch sap during the day, and a thin layer of Erborian’s bamboo waterlock mask w/ a few drops of squalane oil mixed in. Technically a mask, but even better as a moisturizer. Hands down the most hydrating thing I’ve ever put on my face.
3442 2018-09-19 16:40:48 With each passing signing, Leaf fans on my timeline are pouring more burning oil on their Nylander effigies.
3443 2018-09-19 16:40:41 If lumber etc had the same impact on a environmentally sensitive area as oil spills, AB would have a solid case.
3444 2018-09-19 16:40:39 The hell did you use before? Water? Oil? Blood? And it better not be skimmed milk either. Next try a honey and marmite sandwich.

3458 2018-09-19 16:39:40 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
3459 2018-09-19 16:39:26 As a side note I spoke out against Ted Cruz's father promoting Cruz as 'anointed by God', especially when there was an entire show, including Mr. Cruz senior participating in anointing son Cruz's head with oil as a political event. I also spoke out about how Obama was treated 1/
3460 2018-09-19 16:39:23 He said he had big dreams but oil prices went south.
3461 2018-09-19 16:39:21 Quick, somebody tell the Americans his family is linked to the illegal drug trade. That should delay his return.
3462 2018-09-19 16:39:16 Abrahimic religions need 1500 years to reform ! Hinduism had a head start & it thrashed out its volatility 5000 years back...Just as Muslims were reaching the first step of reformation OIL happened & this process got reversed by another 100 years..
3463 2018-09-19 16:39:10 Oil change every 3000. Is good
3464 2018-09-19 16:39:07 I swear all my car do is burn oil son
3465 2018-09-19 16:39:05 I agree 100%. I feel like, for my body, even the smallest amount of stress inhibits fat loss (even if it doesn't necessarily = fat gain).

I swear, I didn't start losing visceral fat until I started taking CBD oil - which suppresses cortisol production.
3466 2018-09-19 16:38:48 Is this the same Al Gore who backed the corrupt Clintons and the Clinton  Foundation, who profits from Global Warming, who protected Russian Oil and dirty money interests back in the 90's?
3467 2018-09-19 16:38:47 Last time i checked. It was saudia arbia who saved US ass and agreed to sell oil in Dollars in 1970s. Rest of the world was willing to ditch dollar. Kindly search the history :)

3473 2018-09-19 16:37:58 All travelers must comply w/ federal law on transporting marijuana & cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening.
3474 2018-09-19 16:37:57 Sitting up in the wee small hours hand stitching vintage lace curtains while watching some of the best #scifi around, cast from my Motorola G4, sipping Australian merlot and the scent of fair trade coconut oil in the air. I own no home or gold. I dress humbly. I am grateful.
3475 2018-09-19 16:37:57 Considering how wrong everyone was about the viability of crystalline solar cells and peak oil I'd be skeptical of predictions that we just can't make enough batteries.
3476 2018-09-19 16:37:55 I'm hoping last night was the worst of it. The poor kid cried until 2 a.m., when I finally tried coconut oil after everything else did nothing to help. He woke up crying a few more times after that, but at least was able to get *some* sleep. I hate not being able to help him 
3477 2018-09-19 16:37:50 I use mobile 1 in my truck and all the videos on YouTube have comments that talk shit about that oil in my truck. Do I switch and see if it fixed my problem even though I just changed my oil?
3478 2018-09-19 16:37:42 “They can say whatever they want” ERCOT is an independent entity that has done an excellent job maintaining our grid

You are paid to represent oil/gas interests

Why should anyone believe you over them? 

The fact is, ERCOT doesn’t see renewables negatively impacting reliability
3479 2018-09-19 16:37:35 When you bring your car in for an oil change and they wanna give you recommendations. STFU and change the damn oil

3484 2018-09-19 16:37:00 Trump is likely trying to keep world trade going and stability=not a bad thing, but we have Western money cartel and Israeli interests screwing it up. Russia opposes balkanization of it's partners. Russia doesn't like the Wests's pushy attempts to dominate LNG and oil pipelines.
3485 2018-09-19 16:36:53 Have you tried CBD oil or greens? It has done a lot for the physical effects of my anxiety.

3487 2018-09-19 16:36:16 I just want to thank glycerine and coconut oil for coming through with the renovation of the season.  I've never been more happy with my skin!!
3488 2018-09-19 16:36:15 Oil is already running out in lighter
My stomach is nervously burning inside

Meltdown, iroha
3489 2018-09-19 16:36:06 It's not so much a joke, but the moment I knew I was hooked on your podcast was when you talked about Round The Twist & introduced me to that delightful show.

Also, ....... OIL PRICES!!
3490 2018-09-19 16:35:53 These people are basically snake oil salesmen and women and... therefore it is madness that they try to present this as if it were scientific fact.

3492 2018-09-19 16:35:36 I work in a factory in Bulawayo making cooking oil & looking for Soya Beans from farmers. It would have been “lit” to work on Wall Street or Silicon Valley but this is my reality. So you are right maybe we should just keep it as hard “grind” and “grit”!
3493 2018-09-19 16:35:34 Today I am very grateful for my best friend who I have known for 45 years, and for getting her permission to send her some CBD oil to help her with her struggle against cancer.  Besides prayer, I feel it's the only thing that will help her at this late stage.
3494 2018-09-19 16:35:32 ...and that Mobile Oil Memo you could have snuck out of HQ to blow the lid off them completely?  Sure: you'll never touch it now, because you have an either/or mentality.  But hey, you personally care more about tribes than winning. Glad Seth Rich didn't feel that way. RIP.
3495 2018-09-19 16:35:20 Natural gas is needed for most of Ontario. 
It’s cheaper, safer and better for the environment than heating oil.
3496 2018-09-19 16:35:08 I’ve taken cbd oil and it’s pretty calming. Microdose for your first try
3497 2018-09-19 16:34:59 Those are the regions with the oil and the oligarchs... highest average salaries are in same places
3498 2018-09-19 16:34:58 How stupid do you think we are?
We are not the only country in the world. Iran has a treaty with everyone else but us. So they will get oil somewhere else.
3499 2018-09-19 16:34:51 Taking assslicking to a higher level. @PatsonDzamara says where @nelsonchamisa goes, he goes. Wher Nero ducks he ducks, wher nero dips his oil stick, #Dzamadzama dips too. Is Wamba's oil cylinder safe there? @matigary @KMutisi @Mavhure @misscailah
3500 2018-09-19 16:34:24 Ha! It’s so long since I had one of theirs that I can’t remember but I just hate the place. The fries always taste as if the oil needs changed and it’s always full of rowdies. :/
3501 2018-09-19 16:34:15 Brother, this isn’t something we can take it very lightly. Lot of lives have been destroyed and TPLF got lot of $$ from Chinese Oil companies:  This is our resource and we should have the greatest influence on how to manage it. The days of exploitation and steeling is over.

3531 2018-09-19 16:31:04 No the point is to squeeze the mullahs (who use oil $ for terrorism) until they GTFO of Iran, and Iranians can have their country back. Much better plan than Obama’s pallets of cash, lol.
3532 2018-09-19 16:31:00 I need to go back to steaming my face with tea tree oil and drinking lemon water oko. My face is a mess
3533 2018-09-19 16:30:58 We have took the car back in twice and you told us you cannot find the fault, you also overfilled the oil which caused problems, I’m in my rights to ask for a full refund
3534 2018-09-19 16:30:49 Olive oil is good .... though not sure it’ll get rid of actual infection. Good for softening wax!
3535 2018-09-19 16:30:43 Interesting idea. However as we won't do that for victims of violence fleeing abuse,  be it from another government or an abusive partner I doubt that. We giv e money to countries with oil and countries that allow   US mitary bases there.

3553 2018-09-19 16:28:12 Oil fields really be in the middle of nowhere
3554 2018-09-19 16:28:12 Of course it is wrong to accuse a leave voter of being stupid.
When infact they have been well and truly out witted by devious and conniving snake oil salesmen.

3563 2018-09-19 16:27:42 We looked at buying in Edinburgh just b4 the oil downturn. When the oil price crashed, people moved back to the capital so property prices rocketed. Flats that were selling for £300k around 3 yrs ago are now going for over £400k. We wish we’d bought there on BTL!

meanwhile us girls just sit here and let the guys do them cause we are princesses 
3576 2018-09-19 16:25:25 I can smell the cutting oil
3577 2018-09-19 16:25:25 I'm sure the people of Venezuela, once richest country in latin America and sitting on the world's largest proven oil reserves didn't think it would end up like this either. Alas....

And no, neither of those are my major concern.
3578 2018-09-19 16:25:24 @MBuhari now I see where the problems lyes, former ex president wife backing indigenous oil firm to chase oil giant shell off Oml 25 , owns 70% shares of the companys interest.
3579 2018-09-19 16:25:20 I've just started using CBD oil for my dog who has a severe spinal issue, and who is suffering chronic pain. Conventional meds have not touched the problem,  but she's been on CBD oil now for two weeks, and I am just beginning to see a glimmer that she may at last be more comfy
3580 2018-09-19 16:25:19 So that doesn't mean we can't find better ways to implement necessary changes.  Renewables is a fast growing industry, and we will soon have a lot of people out of work from oil & gas. They could be retrained and have a bright future!
3581 2018-09-19 16:25:16 Yes! we use very little oil or none when we use ours #ChickenChat

3586 2018-09-19 16:25:04 This is complete B.S. - "working" would be Iran stopping its nuke program - that was the whole point of the deal Trump killed. Of course sanctions will reduce Iran's oil exports. That's not the point. The point is that the sanctions have not impacted Iran's nuclear program.
3587 2018-09-19 16:24:58 Sir now to Russia....Putin is broke and a little bit crazy...The paltry 1.7 Trillion GDP might cause desperate actions from his dying regime. Denuclearization in exchange for oil patch tech. Thats all they have.. Sir..MAGA

3593 2018-09-19 16:24:23 Here we go first liberals pass bill C69 to make it impossible to build pipelines now they will pass one to stop oil transported by train.  These liberals need to go in 2019.

3598 2018-09-19 16:23:56 Oil price increase & a stronger dollar was due to Trump's tax cut and him slapping sanctions on Iran oil exports. During Zuma presidency political objectives were put ahead of economic consequences but Cyril has it worse cause he has 2 major economic countries tarrifing each othr
3599 2018-09-19 16:23:41 I was getting an oil change one time and the guy asked me when I was due. I said I wasn't pregnant. I just had a baby. He said, "oh so you just haven't lost the weight yet?" I didn't even know what to say after that. Made a complaint, never been back there.
3600 2018-09-19 16:23:31 Well Ive neglected the hell out of it :P not even bothered to change the oil since Ive had it. Previous history is totally unknown, but judging by the crap condition of the paintwork laquer flaking off, and the bodge-job repaired crash damage, I dont think its been treated well
3601 2018-09-19 16:23:28 Who buys razors? I just use a wet stone on my axe, and then shave with that, like a man does.
3602 2018-09-19 16:23:27 I had some CBD oil recently but it interferes with action of my anti-convulsant. Otherwise, I’d be frying my onions in it

3604 2018-09-19 16:23:12 She never said 100% bud, but Canada (Alberta especially) relies on the oil industry that produces significant revenue which pays for roads, schools and hospitals.

3608 2018-09-19 16:23:06 The nuclear weapons can only function if they are fired. I’m pretty sure they sail around oil and gas fields all the time. Are you claiming no ships or subs ever enter the North Sea?
3609 2018-09-19 16:22:57 To everyone protesting the pipelines and oil - when you give up your cars, heat, electricity, computers, tv and all the oil based products - complaining about pipelines is an oxymoron for you.

“The president is doing the opposite of what the experts said, and it seems to be working out,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research.
3613 2018-09-19 16:22:30 You use more power as a gamer then most. You’re a hypocrite. Data Centers use the most power out of any facility with a roof on it.oh the plastic that will be here for a long time because of what you do. Keep living in fantasy land you waist a lot of oil. Hypocrite
3614 2018-09-19 16:22:14 Does it show increased oil drilling pollution recently gone up many folds in USA? 

Hiding something under the carpet?

Why?
3615 2018-09-19 16:22:06 My 2 are arguing over the giving up of palm oil that the youngest has learnt about in science  today - eldest is waving mini cheddars in her face! #deepjoys
3616 2018-09-19 16:22:03 I think Cagguila is Chia's guy and he won't be moved but him and Kassian together are costing the Oil approx 3.5 mill when Upshall and Aberg could do their jobs for approx 2 mill cheaper. Katz has been cutting costs since last year so let's see how this looks come opening night

3627 2018-09-19 16:20:44 I reached to shake his hand, but he pulled away. Confused, I looked at his face then at his hand. That’s when I saw the bandages. Burns, he said. On a visit to an ailing relative, boiling oil had exploded, splattering his face and chest as well as the hand that held the pot.
3628 2018-09-19 16:20:43 Did I mention that CCP has no cogent plan to build out a EV charge network for all the EVs they're pushing the carmakers to sell?

Guess what will fuel transportation if there aren't ways to charge EVs? Oil, yes oil! Oil CN'll need to buy from Non-CN w debt. @BaldingsWorld

3634 2018-09-19 16:20:12  oh no. Tonight will definitely be a lavender oil night 
3635 2018-09-19 16:19:57 I found a couple of Airbnb’s for around £100. 
But yeah, we only tend to eat a room for £50 b/c we get private rooms in basic hostels with a shared bathroom. 
It’s actually more expensive for accommodation than Ldn now since the oil crash shot property prices thru the roof!
3636 2018-09-19 16:19:49 Get you! I'm 6.5... Cannabis Oil on order...
3637 2018-09-19 16:19:49 Cannabis oil can be made by anyone--nothing proprietary about it.  Tilray, via privateer holdings, owns a hella lot, but Tilray's sales (mostly quarterly losses) do not justify $10bn+ valuation.  Canada's entire cannabis market might be $10bn a year.  Might be.
3638 2018-09-19 16:19:48 Picked up the future on Saturday. Team @tesla and @elonmusk have created a beautiful product in the Model 3 that combines innovation, comfort, style, and technology that gives us the best chance to shift our society away from oil/gas. Oh, and it’s also a pure joy to drive!

3641 2018-09-19 16:19:22 Is it... just, like... runny hummus? Or is it a hummus-flavored sauce? (Ok, so those are the same thing technically, but did it start as hummus and get thinned down with extra tahini or some oil, or is it some other condiment with chickpeas and whatnot added....?)
3642 2018-09-19 16:19:21 How the fuck does one use cleasing oil ba? I used it like a toner. Kaya pala bumubula bula pa. Jusme goodluck sa mga breakout ko bukas.

3646 2018-09-19 16:19:07 Don’t care about regime change. It’s about being able to transfer value from me to you without a trusted third party. It’s about certainty that the rules won’t change due to human emotions. Just like gold, oil, copper, water. I’m pretty sure dictators have those too.

3657 2018-09-19 16:18:35 Tanzanian people should change their lifestyles because I've noticed in daressalaam alone people queue up at restaurants for chicken barbecue and French fries every night from sunset to midnight or so. They are consuming lots of cooking oil while preparing the meals. It's suicide

3663 2018-09-19 16:18:09 No, in a more nuanced discussion intelligent people would see that bombing a country to destruction and hundreds of thousands of people to death makes Hillary worse than the tyrants she hopes to depose for oil as much as liberty, and is no stance against authoritarianism at all
3664 2018-09-19 16:18:00 Помню, шла когда-то домой, и две девки, идущие впереди меня, врубили русский рэп. Знаете, у меня возникло жгучее желание врубить им под уши японских вокалоидов.

3688 2018-09-19 16:15:54 It depends on how the devil had influenced my Gran that morning. If she was in a good mood she would give us oranges, but sometimes she made us drink tea after  then all you burp is just castor oil all day .

3690 2018-09-19 16:15:48 Why its important to always take some off at pivots. 25% rest stop to entry. Especially in oil I tend to take 50% off right at the bat. Thats me though. Some I know do 25% up to you.

3730 2018-09-19 16:11:19 The answer is coconut oil — after you shower, rub a tiny amount (like a water drop amount) all over your hands and then run it through your hair five inches from the root. Brush it out. Let dry.

3752 2018-09-19 16:09:27 I don’t got time to be like “ooh i think it’s time for an oil change ” bitch tell me when it’s time and I’ll come 
3753 2018-09-19 16:09:08 Do Not apologize!!!... this guy is an ignorant asshole!!!!!...& needs to get an education!!) I may have to go oil the boys wheelchairs up...& send them out to educate him... they may be old, but they’re still  experienced!!!!!) lol
3754 2018-09-19 16:09:04 Now now now #weakAndy, purchasing a functional pipeline that ships billions of dollars worth of oil is hardly as much of a disaster or scandal as say bailing out GM and then selling the shares at a lose to generate a one time budgetary surplus before calling an election.
3755 2018-09-19 16:09:03 @dasraghubar har bus owner daily alag alag fare le rha ,oil price hike ka bahana kr k
3756 2018-09-19 16:08:58 oil change light in the whip popped on, ima just ignore it and hopefully it goes away

3758 2018-09-19 16:08:43 Miss Oil
3759 2018-09-19 16:08:33 I need to get an oil change and lunch. Where this lady at?!
3760 2018-09-19 16:08:31 1 part organic coconut oil, 4 parts sodium bicarbonate, a couple of drops orange essential oil. Mix well together and voila. 
3761 2018-09-19 16:08:22 Oil pullin is the only method I know but there has to be more
3762 2018-09-19 16:08:19 ECONOMIC INDICATORS: 19 September @ 18:00

3763 2018-09-19 16:07:58 The price of minerals adjusted for inflation trends down over time as we become better at extracting and substituting. Look what happened with oil, the price got high and tars/shales/sands came on line—now there are hundreds of years of new supply which constrains price.
3764 2018-09-19 16:07:57 Jusko puyat na puyat ako sa cliente kanina
3765 2018-09-19 16:07:55 My oil light went on this morning like I don't have enough to get done today 
3766 2018-09-19 16:07:36 I'm not sure what you mean by "virtual hard-limit". Until fracking, there was oil that was known to exist that was thought would never be profitable to recover.
3767 2018-09-19 16:07:31 yeah.  Exactly.  It is money FROM Big OIl and it is going to local companies to get into the supply business, thereby creating jobs.  Totally the opposite of what Kerri claimed.
3768 2018-09-19 16:07:29 The oil boom sucks for everyone besides the people who are directly involved in it. Just because the oilfield workers who stay here can afford to pay for it, that doesn't mean we all can. #higherhousingcosts #higherfoodcosts #highercostofliving
3769 2018-09-19 16:07:21 Howdy Jeff, obviously you and I remember the summer of 2015 differently. Maybe you have legit criticisms of the study but at the time I was told that quoting it was just another piece of evidence for of a vast oil conspiracy. Not sure why you take this so personally.
3770 2018-09-19 16:07:20 Your statement is so ridiculous. Suzuki is not a scientist. He is a “concerned” citizen, who makes a lot of money being concerned.  He is a hypocrite, just like the rest of us. Fact: I hate pollution but I drove to work today. I’m sure you have benefited from oil today too.
3771 2018-09-19 16:07:19 Its nice when you change your oil and they check all your tires, and sometimes rotate when needed!
3772 2018-09-19 16:07:08 Hello,
Any new updates on the progress?
How was the 1st batch of cbd oil? When is the facility at full production capability?
Thanks for responding
3773 2018-09-19 16:07:07 @PastorJohnHagee Sister you don’t have to cry just go on your knees and thank God who has directed me to you, The ways of God is never the ways of Men, my ministry have a crude oil agency in Africa, that will be sending you the funds.
3774 2018-09-19 16:07:04 X buat double cleansing ke?.. cleansing oil lps tu cleanser..
3775 2018-09-19 16:06:57 Friet = fried/frying. So... a cup of frying oil? Or a fried anything? #teampatat
3776 2018-09-19 16:06:54 So is tying oil pipelines to USA- Carter out of the question now?
3777 2018-09-19 16:06:47 When oil crashed you said don’t blame us but now as it bounces back you want to claim credit? It isnt both, so which is it? #ABpoli
3778 2018-09-19 16:06:24 so for castor oil only, you just put in ur hand then apply it
3779 2018-09-19 16:06:23 Yet, 1 million plus died and US companies got richer by appropriating everything there. The same happens to every country who doesn’t comply with our gvnt. Coincidence? Venezuela wants to sell or “trade” its oil at price that’s fair to them. It can’t because of US sanctions.
3780 2018-09-19 16:06:12 republinuts are so confused. being taught to hate muslims and climate science to perpetuate the oil economy, paid for with saudi oil money.
3781 2018-09-19 16:06:05 Coconut oil or baking soda mixed with peroxide.
3782 2018-09-19 16:06:02 And I've got some snake oil I want to sell you.

3785 2018-09-19 16:05:32 Dear Rach, oil crashed plain and simple. It is slowly rebounding and so is our economy. To be fair, I haven’t disliked the NDP #ABLeg as much as I thought I would. Thats as close to a compliment I can give. But let’s not pretend this is all a big ndp government move >
3786 2018-09-19 16:05:30 @amaldonado2493 checking the oil
3787 2018-09-19 16:05:27 We did it with oil by God we'll do it with this too.
3788 2018-09-19 16:05:16 Doing some CBD oil and depression today. 
Maybe a little Class Rank on Netflix.
3789 2018-09-19 16:05:11 Postmedia is so far up the ass of the Cons and the oil companies it would hurt them all to pull out.
3790 2018-09-19 16:04:55 Sry Dennis but the NFL is a job just like any other. Coal, steel, oil field workers don’t get a lifetime pension and healthcare after only working a couple years. Those industries are more lucrative than the NFL and one could argue is far more dangerous and harder on your body.
3791 2018-09-19 16:04:46 I thought Reagan was dumb. Then Dubya made him look smart. This tops it all tho.
3792 2018-09-19 16:04:05 @realDonaldTrump How about protecting us & our kids from the global cataclysm that will occur with your dumb (non) approach to climate change. You’re a shill for coal and oil. What do you care? You’ll likely be dead within ten years, leaving the rest of us to deal. #IdiotInChief
3793 2018-09-19 16:04:03 My husband works in construction in the oil & gas industry. The steel needed for projects is a higher grade that what is manufactured in  States. Projects require steel that's manufactured in South Korea. With tariffs, companies are delaying projects that cost 25% more.
3794 2018-09-19 16:04:02 #Nifty has corrected significantly from it's recent top but still can't say that it will definitely bounce back. Trade war, rupee depreciation, oil price hike etc posing threat against higher valuation, so, it's better to have faster correction than long drawn and painful one....
3795 2018-09-19 16:03:58 So some of your parents loved you enough not to make you taste the demon that is Castor Oil???!
Mmmmmmmmust be nice.

3797 2018-09-19 16:03:51 See. My car tells me when i need an oil change. I get good expensive ass oil changes too so that could be why

3799 2018-09-19 16:03:28 oil pulling generates antioxidants that actually damage the cell wall of microorganisms and kill them. These are the organisms that lead to the decay of the mouth, build up of plaque
3800 2018-09-19 16:03:23 Premier Dwight Ball announced $60-million dollars over the next ten years for non-profit and business organizations working in the oil and gas sector. The funding is being provided by Husky Energy and partners in the West White Rose project.
3801 2018-09-19 16:03:08 Those Hawaiian BBQ Kettle chops r and they’re done in acacado oilsooo gooood!!
3802 2018-09-19 16:03:07 Frankly, I care about climate more than I care whether ExxonMobil or Elon Musk or anyone else makes a profit or not. But any rationing system for GHG will have to decline to zero in about two decades (if it is effective), so that will take care of oil company profits for you.
3803 2018-09-19 16:03:07 We chase new cars, old cars, side dumps, air dumps, and oil dumps.  Just no tiny plastic cars. 

We manage 2200 cars in the field every year!
3804 2018-09-19 16:03:05 be warned - they are demoing the essential oil steam thrower things so the place is overwhelmingly smelly
3805 2018-09-19 16:02:57 What's a good cleansing oil for someone with oily & acne-prone skin?
3806 2018-09-19 16:02:44 Blegh. I keep seeing all sorts of those essential oil things around here especially. There’s a giant billboard for Young Living essential oils and I just shudder in disgust everytime I see it. I especially hate when clients at work think rubbing their pets in oils heals them.
3807 2018-09-19 16:02:28 Why didn't @jaketapper press @BarackObama specifically how our health insurance was going down 2500 per year? And Mr. president, just what is a role that Speculators make to the oil prices like they did under your administration? Ask a question instead of worshipping.
3808 2018-09-19 16:02:28 They put like the oil and parsley on it, which was fine with me, BUT now they have like chili flake on it and other spices which just doesn’t taste good with the sauce
3809 2018-09-19 16:02:26 Route N in Shannon County reduced to seal road with mixture of rock and oil on Tuesday, Sept. 25 and Wednesday, Sept. 26 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.

3814 2018-09-19 16:02:04 Even if you're excited about a Botox party, you still need to focus on the necessary prep. That means holding off on any fish oil supplements for about a week before your infections.

3816 2018-09-19 16:01:32 Might be better to work on hydration in your skincare to help the oil production, I have the becca and don’t really draw for it anymore, it’s sooo mattifying
3817 2018-09-19 16:01:18 รอๆๆๆนะคะ 
3818 2018-09-19 16:01:17 so there is no difference in the number of blog posts/"white papers" on ending renewables vs ending oil/gas subsidies?

Y'all organized folks locally against renewable subsidies, did y'all do that opposing oil/gas subsidies?

If you're against both, why the unequal treatment?
3819 2018-09-19 16:01:13 Lots of extractive industries. Among the highest in the country minus the oil rich regions.
3820 2018-09-19 16:01:09 Oh wow. Hm, ever tried lavender essential oil and tea tree oil in coconut oil carrier? That usually helps with split ends
3821 2018-09-19 16:01:02 Neroli oil is an essential oil produced from the blossom of the bitter orange tree. It's a nontoxic, nonirritant and nonphototoxic substance. Besides it wonderful smell, it's also an antiseptic, disinfectant and heals scars and promotes the generation of new cells. 
3822 2018-09-19 16:01:01 Gabe is the the coconut oil Jesus...he can’t do anything wrong in Joe’s eyes 
3823 2018-09-19 16:01:00 Wow, calling the police on white people, that's a first.
3824 2018-09-19 16:00:58 Finally home after doing an 9 hour shift and going to get an oil change and buy some groceries I’m finally laying in bed about to rest my eyes.
3825 2018-09-19 16:00:54 The US government loves the people of Venezuela so much it wants to bribe elitist collaborators to help it steal their oil, poison their environment and subvert their government. Why would ANY Venezuelan support this unless they were willing to sell out their fellow citizens?
3826 2018-09-19 16:00:53 If you truly, honestly believe royalties are too high and that subsidies (tax breaks, incentives, etc.) do not exist, we can't help you... 

If you believe this AND live in Alberta, you are running blind into a grim future. Oil's done and the province has given it all away...
3827 2018-09-19 16:00:49 imagine waking up after having an amazing dream with EXO only to spill hot oil all over your arm in the morning and now clipping your palm in the washing machine and having a giant blood blister forming

3836 2018-09-19 16:00:01 Stop pretending to be knowledgeable in any form, confusing raw bitumen with AB heavy.

Maybe its Notley's method to be allowed to identify heavy oil as whatever grade. And you might want to use more relevant sources....
3837 2018-09-19 15:59:57 I started with the cleanser black seed oil though
3838 2018-09-19 15:59:53 If you don’t think that the health of resident orca populations reflect our attitude toward and lack of respect for the marine environment however you have a lot to learn. We must be more responsible stewards of our marine environ. Moving beyond oil

3847 2018-09-19 15:58:14 Lavender essential oil will help calm them. It only takes 1-2 drops on something or use a diffuser. I have to use if for one of mine. He loves to have rock sessions from 9-3 & climb blinds. It helps him chill out. He's mostly tame but he still wants out at night. Oil chills him
3848 2018-09-19 15:58:08 @SecretService

3849 2018-09-19 15:57:53 I hear ya. Can’t have too much avocado but should try avocado oil. Nuts and seeds are staples of mine! Squirrel diet.

3856 2018-09-19 15:57:08 I got excited seeing my home county so lit up then I realized that whole pocket of ND lights up and it’s almost certainly because of oil
3857 2018-09-19 15:57:04 It's a MONQ essential oil dispenser pen. All natural, organic, & not addictive with no nicotine. 
3858 2018-09-19 15:57:03 i use palmers cleansing oil!! my esthetician included this in my routine
3859 2018-09-19 15:56:41 It’s coffee with butter, heavy cream and grass fed collagen peptides for protein. You can add coconut oil too but I don’t. Then you blend it together. It’s so good.

3862 2018-09-19 15:56:31 I can not understand how they want to draw so much attention to Carter Page. If there is one person who. deserved to be under surveillance it is him. His dalliances with Russian spies,  his desire to pursue dodgy oil and his Anti USA speeches in Moscow surely cry out for a FISA.
3863 2018-09-19 15:56:26 Precision: they require an upgrade to handle heavy oil.  Irving, Valero and Suncor have all analyzed this. The economics are good for the upgrade. 

However, both the producers and the refiners want to capture as much of the price differential as possible hence no commitment

3877 2018-09-19 15:55:32 big oil is certainly an influence.. but there is no such thing as foreign interest. as big multi-nationals are without borders, creed, or religion. except that of profit.. those lines are made for the average man/woman to identify with and control.. the ego is easily manipulated
3878 2018-09-19 15:55:23 Why do these geniuses think a battery bus with two tons of extra deadweight is going to be better at climbing steep hills than a bus drawing power directly from the mains? Too much snake oil from certain companies?

3884 2018-09-19 15:54:27 Trump has now allowed more methane leaks on federal oil and gas land leases. WE KNOW that methane is deadly. How are we letting this happen?  Oh yes, that’s right, it’s the GOP that is letting Trump do this.

3890 2018-09-19 15:53:59 I bought a truck off an Armenian dude. He sent me to 2 of his cousins businesses to get discounts on an tires and an oil change
3891 2018-09-19 15:53:20 Hour and a half wait for an oil change greayyyttt
3892 2018-09-19 15:53:08 Sunflower oil is a great oil to massage into the skin to remove dirt & oil
3893 2018-09-19 15:53:06 Ha ha you've been using snake oil for years. Now the real cure comes along, you're too brainwashed to believe it ha ha. Cretin
3894 2018-09-19 15:53:05 Blunder means that it didn’t work as intended. That would be incorrect. Fracking has created much oil wealth, which was the goal. Energy independence is a suggested reason. It there are only a few companies that control the oil production to begin with.

3900 2018-09-19 15:52:25 Evening primrose oil massaged into somewhere maybe the cervix although not sure that is physically possible. Are you overdue? First babies often go late. I would just rest as you will get no rest once they are out! But it’s v frustrating this stage
3901 2018-09-19 15:52:24 Whether that is true or not .. Canada leads the way.. in environmental and ethical standards  .. and oil consumption is on the rise in the world and growing rapidly.. Our product should be helping other countries with the best product not less 
3902 2018-09-19 15:52:15 Dawg how do i get here early just to still have to wait i line for an hr for an oil change ?!

3905 2018-09-19 15:51:44 Tak sesuai guna cleansing oil, guna cleansing balm (Banila & Co, Heimish All Clean Balm, Clinique)
3906 2018-09-19 15:51:36 Indeed! Tina Joemat-Pettersson approved the sale at $28 within 24hrs of it being presented to her - although oil was trading at $52 at the time. And once scrutiny started in 2016 she maintained, for months, that it was a 'stock rotation'- later proved to be a lie.
3907 2018-09-19 15:51:15 “You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.””
Hebrews 1:9 NIV 
3908 2018-09-19 15:51:14 Could it be something to do with oil?  and them being against Assad's Syria?
3909 2018-09-19 15:51:03 Noooo JiffyPop is where I take my car for an oil change
3910 2018-09-19 15:51:01 AFP: Venezuela to bump China oil exports to one million barrels a day

Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro doubles down on Chinese money to rescue a crashing economy.
3911 2018-09-19 15:51:00 Big Oil has been getting the deal of a fucking lifetime in AB and ripping off the province for years.  Why dont you go find out about it and show us what you find... We’ll wait asshole...
3912 2018-09-19 15:50:59 3. The over reliance on oil and also the government's disastrous monetary policy vis-a-vis the dollar have played a role in the crisis, but so have the government's disastrous policies of super heavy taxation, wage and price controls, nationalization, and rationing
3913 2018-09-19 15:50:52 WTF!!  Oil needs to be changed just throw the whole car away!!! 
3914 2018-09-19 15:50:41 Well taking responsability for my sex life is all I can do. Birth control is cheap enough that if oyu can have sex you can buy it. I bet most people who have issue with abortion is the fact libs want to make it liek going to jiffy lube to get an oil change
3915 2018-09-19 15:50:38 I’m never gone pay anyone to change my oil again. Should’ve been doin this 
3916 2018-09-19 15:50:35 An oil and gas company (that diversified into fishing business/fish oil in the 70’s) the Glazers only took over in 1994 as well. That’s 30 years after the Bush family sold it! But let’s not let facts get in the way of the banter 
3917 2018-09-19 15:50:25 This dude had this little green bottle of tea tree oil with a spray nozzle on it and it's supposed to cleanse impurities or smthn and prevent breakouts, he had me use some of his and felt awesome
3918 2018-09-19 15:50:19 Not to mention the rest of the country is thrilled to take billions of dollars in equalization payments from Alberta’s oil wealth, but at the same time they don’t want pipelines. 
3919 2018-09-19 15:50:06 What kind of oil cleansing do you do?? Educate me sis 
3920 2018-09-19 15:49:47 I don’t kno who daughter need to hear this but , get a MF oil change 
3921 2018-09-19 15:49:27 Not to mention Quebec actually Fucking imports oil from other fucking countries. 

No access to tide water forces us to sell Canadian oil to the US at a ridiculously low price, because we can’t reach any other customers.
3922 2018-09-19 15:49:21 Stop the idiot wars for PNAC ...Stop shedding your blood for foreign devils, corporations, opium and cocaine production and distribution oil, natural resources and the military industrial complex. STOP this bandaid BULL  and get to the root of the problem
3923 2018-09-19 15:49:16 Because they’re bought and paid for big oil and foreign interests.

3925 2018-09-19 15:49:10 2. The Chavez era growth came from the government directing the economy into over-reliance on oil, you can't blame the oil collapse abd then praise Chavez
3926 2018-09-19 15:49:07 he can pay for it with the stolen oil
3927 2018-09-19 15:48:59 I'm lying in bed, listening to The Doors. I really should oil those hinges.
3928 2018-09-19 15:48:57 Because the royalty PAYS the province for the resource that Big Oil extracts.  And the royalties paid to AB are a FRACTION of what other countries charge for their oil. Go research what Norway charges.

3934 2018-09-19 15:47:50 Is any one of you in trouble? He should pray. Is anyone happy? Let him sing songs of praise. Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.
3935 2018-09-19 15:47:49 The same forces which orchestrated 911 are working at breaking up the Middle East so it's LNG & oil can be stolen and Israel made the supreme power=Why Russia targeted. Though an ally of the West, its against it's partners being broken into bits & is against competing pipelines.
3936 2018-09-19 15:47:43 I agree with the comment here, bro.  Although eSports and content creation takes years of dedicated, disciplined effort, it's not like working on an oil rig or installing pipeline in sub zero temperatures.  It's not "hard" work, it's just a lot of work.
3937 2018-09-19 15:47:20 a new car is on the horizon. I can smell the oil needing to be changed already. lmfao
3938 2018-09-19 15:47:20 To take good care of your tires, we recommend a tire rotation every time you get an oil change.
3939 2018-09-19 15:47:16 @VelshiRuhle what’s wrong with smoking pot now that it’s becoming legal, here in Indianapolis they recognized that cbd oil actually helps ppl and pets for Christ’s sake

3944 2018-09-19 15:46:55 Yes well Graham and women..pretty much oil and water.
3945 2018-09-19 15:46:49 Coffee, 1tbs butter, 1tbs heavy cream and a tbs of grass fed collagen peptides. (I don’t add the coconut oil but you can) The protein in the peptides keeps me full and it’s so yummy.

3957 2018-09-19 15:45:27 But the US is a net importer, a hegemonic consumer, not a producer

look at differences of oil policy between Uk and US

UK ran policy for benefit of UK oil companies
US policy is for US consumers and geopolitical concerns

3961 2018-09-19 15:45:10 Is MCT oil powder as effective as the oil?
3962 2018-09-19 15:44:49 This... but also the amount of shit I stole from my art department at school as well. I legit have about 30 rulers, two sets of oil pastilles, two waterpaint sets and god knows how many erasers

3966 2018-09-19 15:44:34 Absolutely. You could even oil cleanse for 5 minutes before washing it off. You’ll start to feel the oil plugs in your skin lifting out the pores.
3967 2018-09-19 15:44:22 hotel breakfast be oil asll
3968 2018-09-19 15:44:15 Nope... No worries about any screening of any sort, whatsoever.  Just listening to my body 'laboratory' and noticing things. I'm pretty sure there's more to CBD oil than the THC free part.  Just my opinion after first trying it today. 
3969 2018-09-19 15:44:11 That's because the majority of people out there believe in this fake conspiracy that scientists all have an agenda against w/e they believe is right whether religion, oil/gas industry, coal, or global warming (a lot think it isn't real.) Its pure ignorance imo.
3970 2018-09-19 15:44:10 I use:

3973 2018-09-19 15:44:04 Given that Alberta consistently scores the lowest of all provinces on measures of gender equality, the cynic in me has to wonder if that's not the point.  After all, it's a province that has traditionally been government by conservative oil men.
3974 2018-09-19 15:43:53 Oil?
3975 2018-09-19 15:43:51 anyways i got cbd oil today and i feel i’ve been so much more relaxed anxiety wise even though today was Sister Stressful
3976 2018-09-19 15:43:50 Its not snake oil, its our operational reality. The constraint isn't money, it's real resources. MMT explains this.
3977 2018-09-19 15:43:40 for night terrors. I put those oils in the diffuser and then mixed with a carrier oil on her feet then put socks on then massaged into her back/shoulders and chest. Prayinnng it works even better tonight
3978 2018-09-19 15:43:36 I grew up with Indians..Coconut oil used to do wonders for their hair...Might be worth a try..lol
3979 2018-09-19 15:43:28 my mom came out of her therapy appointment the other day and was like “so I think im going to look into cbd oil, my therapist just said she uses it for anxiety and swears by it!” then I told her abt wanting a cbd vape and she was totally on board. what a woman.

3981 2018-09-19 15:43:10 Sis, do you treat it with castor oil only?
3982 2018-09-19 15:43:01 “Oil companies are the largest buyers of dollars in India.” That must be to pay for the oil? What do they ‘buy’ dollars with? Anyway, the oil industry is finished.
3983 2018-09-19 15:42:59 Its super cheap and has a great profit margin. Salt, oil, and kernels all have good shelf life. 
As said, salty foods increase soda sales.

Popcorn and soda sales are the lifeblood of movie theaters economic viability. 

That said, it smells like feet and tastes like spitballs.
3984 2018-09-19 15:42:56 You've obviously never been to Manhattan Beach. Maybe he lives next to the oil refinery that borders the whole north side of town. The flight path for LAX is near there too.
3985 2018-09-19 15:42:51 The Gazette is owned by Phil Anschutz, who just happens to have earned much of his fortune in the oil business.
3986 2018-09-19 15:42:49 Sitting in the shop waiting for an oil change and a fix on a cruise control re-call and my battery is dying on my phone. The race is on - will my car be done before my phone dies? #prayforme

3988 2018-09-19 15:42:38 Getting my oil changed today. Depending on when that is done I will be playing either wow or ootr. Game time decision so stay tuned!
3989 2018-09-19 15:42:30 Carl's week:

*prostituted himself to #FakeNews as usual
*put in yet another futile effort to help oil industry
*conveyed ridiculous propaganda and actually believed it himself
*spewed BS along with the other blabbering heads
*secretly admired @Tesla and @elonmusk from his closet
3990 2018-09-19 15:42:19 The best solution would have been a FEDERATION. Oil interests created South Sudan because they wanted to avoid US sanctions.
3991 2018-09-19 15:42:18 Beard oil comes in tmm 
3992 2018-09-19 15:42:16 Y'all, I have taken celebrex, tramadol, Tylenol 3, and cbd oil (Justin lovingly refers to it as my hippie medicine) and after 2 10 hours on my feet my pain is *screaming* at me. Could I please get animals in here to distract me from this because my meds are doing fuck all.
3993 2018-09-19 15:42:01 I think I’m going to short crude oil 
3994 2018-09-19 15:41:59 Educate yourself 1- our country is the third richest country in natural resources minerals gas oil phosphate uranium you name it 2- look at dubai they ran out of oil years ago & now oil only counts 2% of the gdp dubai still going strong

3997 2018-09-19 15:41:38 Cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the UAE are extremely wealthy because the government is investing all the oil profits in infrastructure, tourism, education, and many other businesses. 

Nigeria is just behind the UAE in net oil exportation. Buhari, see your mates?
3998 2018-09-19 15:41:22 Oil change & car wash next
3999 2018-09-19 15:41:20 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.

4001 2018-09-19 15:41:15 "I have a big problem with people burning oil, but less of a problem with people using oil products"

?????

So you use oil.  Ergo, you support the pipeline.

4005 2018-09-19 15:41:00 @EnergyPhilFlynn observes 

"Oil prices continue to defy bearish expectations as U.S. demand remains near a record high and Iranian exports continues to plummet. Iranian oil exports have plunged about 35% since April."
4006 2018-09-19 15:40:50 Wed AM: corn +0.25Z, beans +7.5X, meal +4.50Z, wheat +7.5Z-SRW. Hogs -0.875Z, cattle +0.5Z. Crude oil +0.96 on lower stocks. Dollar is steady. Dow stocks rally 200 on rates helping banks. Catepillar. Grain futures see less pressure.

4010 2018-09-19 15:40:32 Yes, sort of, coolant    Last time I changed the oil on a motorbike, I actually felt a bit queasy due to the way the warm, sticky, smelly liquid poured out - it was just the the consistency of blood, though not a healthy colour

4019 2018-09-19 15:39:47 We can afford to this if the @GOP stop giving billions of subsidies to for-profit private industries, like the oil industry, and corporations.
4020 2018-09-19 15:39:46 It would be good to see national environmental groups & activists do the same and divest from the Big Oil/Pipelines/War/Big Banks Democratic Party

4021 2018-09-19 15:39:18 why the FUCK is an oil change so expensive and why does my car need one
4022 2018-09-19 15:39:12 If I'm not mistaken @McDonaldsCanada, don't you fry your chicken nuggets, crispy chicken and filet-o-fish? Do you segregate your oil so there is no cross-contamination of animal proteins/fats and the fries? If not, can you really claim that the oil is vegan or vegetarian?
4023 2018-09-19 15:39:04 เข้าใจตรงกับพี่นั่นแหละ
4024 2018-09-19 15:39:04 The Pit Stop located at 164 Hwy 380W is the perfect place to get your oil changed or many other car repairs necessities. Give them a call at 940-550-8901
4025 2018-09-19 15:38:56 Calm down, you'll make it InshaAllah sis, stay safe, what Allah has written will surely be, the timing might not be as u planned,but he plans the best for you.

ASADABAD/KABUL (AIP):  At least three children were injured while fire erupted in arms and oil depots in a military base after separate rocket attacks in eastern #Kunar province, police said Wednesday.
4028 2018-09-19 15:38:36 People pray for cake. Then when God gives them butter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan and an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen!
He will give you the tools but you still need to put in the work!

4030 2018-09-19 15:38:26 Hop in it all dusty hands covered with oil, the disrespect.

Never leave your car unattended.
4031 2018-09-19 15:38:21 Shout out to the @HomeDepot for having an app that shows you the exact aisle and location of the product you're trying to find at the store you're in  I would have just spent an hour in that store trying to find the fuel + oil mix I needed.
4032 2018-09-19 15:38:16 Rasanya apa apa jenis oil pun tak boleh kann ?

4035 2018-09-19 15:37:57 Really don’t want to go get my oil changed. Nope.
4036 2018-09-19 15:37:53 まぁたそ岡山くるんかあぁあぁあ
4037 2018-09-19 15:37:51 Yeah might be but you have to admit that such things don't boost your reputation among Oilers fans, we don't know every circumstances.
You tweet the GIFs, Oil fans are getting salty and you complain or at least wonder why they are and begin to argue, that's provoking and naive.
4038 2018-09-19 15:37:43 Honestly it was great! And I tried all the old wives tales first, the chamomile tea, the crushed aspirin, the tea tree oil - and they all did nothing or made it worse. This stuff felt like some sort of miracle gel 
4039 2018-09-19 15:37:38 I learnt this from one of my guy infact the oil is the last thing he puts and somehow the food comes out great.
4040 2018-09-19 15:37:36 Vince Jr. not booking a shoot fight between Matt Riddle and the sumo that showed up because one of the princes wanted Yokozuna for his next oil mark show is the kinda thing that prevents him from being the greatest promoter of all time
4041 2018-09-19 15:37:31 How is he getting the oil over there? No argument that it should be an option, but how?
4042 2018-09-19 15:37:31 ยุ้ยเคยดูแบบนี้นะแต่เหมือนมันไม่หมดอ่ะรึป่าวไม่แน่ใจ เพราะทวิตเยอะมาก

4050 2018-09-19 15:36:22 An effervescing facial mask, glittery purple, with calamine, ylang ylang oil, and exfoliating pumice. It comes as a gel in a cute jar.
4051 2018-09-19 15:36:20 Jesus also used CBD oil to anoint the sick and feeble.

4059 2018-09-19 15:35:20 Not only is it ugly, disgusting and a means of your skin deposing of waste such as excessive oil, dead skin cells and bacteria stuck in your pores, but they hurt too. There's absolutely no benefit to them. At all.
What's next? Poo-sitivity, because "it's just a natural function"?
4060 2018-09-19 15:35:01 They also came for coconut oil...but I still use it everyday as a better alternative to lotion...

4065 2018-09-19 15:34:27 My nan took my car in the garage because I thought it was broken to be told all it needs is some oil .. she’s now fuming with me  “I hope you feel stupid for wasting the garage mans time Charlotte” ooopsy
4066 2018-09-19 15:34:24 I am done trading for the week because I reached my weekly profit goal for the dweek and also because my cockiness has gone up significantly otherwise after my 10Y short i'd have traded Oil as well
4067 2018-09-19 15:34:20 what does she use. canola oil is also bad.
4068 2018-09-19 15:34:20 I pop my own, in olive oil on the stove top. How about you?
4069 2018-09-19 15:34:03 walk and let them sweat without our water and our discounted oil, yeah we will hurt but they will hurt alot more...
4070 2018-09-19 15:33:52 China tuvo 3 meses destocking crude oil (justo cuando U.S estaba en summer/driving season)..... Y ahora que U.S va a entrar en refinery maintenance season.... China esta comprando.

4072 2018-09-19 15:33:41 I’m really confused with U.K. law because I bought cbd oil from Holland and Barrett the other day? Why are people not being prescribed it if it is already for sale.
4073 2018-09-19 15:33:37 I haven’t had a oil changed since I got my car lmao I don’t know shit bout cars but just driving it
4074 2018-09-19 15:33:14 Here's a question?  Does CBD oil enhance the effects of Thc?  I'm thinking the answer might be yes.
4075 2018-09-19 15:33:01 Ladies:
If you suffer from ovarian cysts, some oils you can use for massages are Frankincense, Geranium, Cypress, Lavender And Clary Sage. 
Always spot test before applying essential oils to your skin and use of a carrier oil such as Jojoba or Coconut is recommended.

4079 2018-09-19 15:32:42 @MANNHUMMELGroup ideally if you were also able to offer us cut through oil filter & cabin filter for our photos that would be fantastic. My colleague is waiting to get tests started. We are running a little late. The oil we will be using is @ExxonMobil_EU Mobil 1 ESP
4080 2018-09-19 15:32:38 My dad paid for my oil change I’m crying y’all  I gave him my card and he still paid for it even though he wrecked his truck yesterday  #blessed
4081 2018-09-19 15:32:37 อด แง้ๆๆๆ
4082 2018-09-19 15:32:28 has oil started coming out too?
4083 2018-09-19 15:32:22 Liberal propaganda. You are failing Canada with protectionist policies, higher taxes, higher payroll costs, more complex regulations and you can't even get our oil to broader markets even though we have the 3rd largest reserves in the world. #failure #cdnpoli
4084 2018-09-19 15:32:22 Oil response: “but the snow blower industry has a monopoly on selling snow blowers in summer!!!!!”
4085 2018-09-19 15:32:14 There are methane pockets in certain areas that have nothing to do with fracking or wells being drilled. The issue is in Colorado though we have the safest and strictest regulations in the country when it comes to oil and gas. I can not speak for other states.

4087 2018-09-19 15:32:01 @MelWallace7 Go and get your oil changed! Damaged People are dangerous!
4088 2018-09-19 15:31:59 @AdamCarollaShow #CastrolChallange What's the deal with "tune-ups"?  Back in the day every 4th oil change was a more expensive tune-up, but now this doesn't seem to be a thing.  Was this a rip-off?
4089 2018-09-19 15:31:32 
4090 2018-09-19 15:31:28 are those grease/oil resistant?
4091 2018-09-19 15:31:24 Because after sawing the oil they were in suspense that it is real or not. So they do that for clarification. And now they will do press conference and say it's TRUE oil.
4092 2018-09-19 15:31:19 These are A PEST!!! Maaan how I loathe zem! Check out Ballistol Animal Oil! Itz a miracle cure, mom rubs it between my toes and onto my ears.
4093 2018-09-19 15:31:13 CNPC has a new report out calling for peak oil demand in China in 2030. Aligns with carbon goals as well. Seems like a lot of things are supposed to happen in the next 12 years.
4094 2018-09-19 15:31:12 Yesssss now this man ain’t gotta call me bout my oil everyday no more
4095 2018-09-19 15:31:10 This Sunday wanted to test the best (levo). Apparently the guy on the small frame took all day to test. Did test the S-works pro though (the S-works epic was not available). The oil colour S-works will be my next bike

4111 2018-09-19 15:29:59 @MANNHUMMELGroup are you guys in a position to point us to your premium cabin air filtration product for anti microbial and pm2.5? Also we are interested in your premium fleece oil filter - both for Octavia VRS Mk2. Filter believed to be OX188D equiv. We are ready to test.
4112 2018-09-19 15:29:43 Okay the reason I never follow american recipes is bc they use weird stuff like 'egg powder' 'vegetable shortening' 'oil spray' ?? Just use natural products wtf
4113 2018-09-19 15:29:42 Like wee nippys lies about oil revenues etc etc. They can’t even run the country with the money they have now. There’s no way that Unionist voters will be convinced by the state of the current administration

4117 2018-09-19 15:29:21 The abduction and killing of an humanitarian worker is well? The daily slaughter of her armed forces is well? That FG now pays double on fuel subsidy when oil prices has falling is well? That the prrsident was at a rally day after an hostage was slaughtered is well?
4118 2018-09-19 15:29:14 Lekki conservation center needs rapid renovation. And next time the wood should be coated with water resistant oil paint . It’s really dangerous because the woods are mostly weak

4135 2018-09-19 15:26:16 That's interesting -- as in data from academia or tech or other private sector companies?
You're welcome – and thank you for explaining and reflecting more. On 2, I have observed the same issue at every level of government over the past decade. Governments *should* be doing this.

4137 2018-09-19 15:26:10 Mr. Lutz should concern himself with his retirement, which is paid on the back of oil companies and internal combustion engines.  He doesn't understand Telsa, and as for @elonmusk ,  a wolf need not concern himself with the opinions of sheep.  GM is the one headed for the grave.

4142 2018-09-19 15:25:41 Yoga, Tai Chi, aroma therapy, essential oils, acupuncture, etc. are all snake oil in my opinion. As you stated, if these modalities worked we wouldn't be desperately pressing for new developments.
4143 2018-09-19 15:25:40 Turns out when people are confronted with post-scarcity, they always make the worst choices.
4144 2018-09-19 15:25:28 Venezuela had its highest GDP under Chavez & the wellbeing of the average citizen improved massively under Chavez.

That is, things improved *after* the oil industry was nationalized.

Btw, 70% of Venezuela's industry is privately-owned so it's hardly even faux 'socialism'.
4145 2018-09-19 15:25:19 And oil

4149 2018-09-19 15:24:48 Norway has so much money from oil and gas, they literally don't know what to do with it.  

They have no need to worry about the economic benefits of EU membership.

4176 2018-09-19 15:21:54 Absolutely we need to investigate, however my husband was a medic for an off-shore oil rig and once had to transport a worker who was having a mental health episode. The guy jumped out of the moving car. They may have been constrained for their own safety.
4177 2018-09-19 15:21:47 So it looks like Big Oil is giving money to not-for-profits that are part of the oil and gas industry? I'm wondering that kind of groups these are and why some of these money never seems to go into social programs

4205 2018-09-19 15:19:03 So very sad and very true!  I often recall how effective the 1973 oil embargo was in the early 1970s. It crippled the West and caused panic everywhere! How things have changed!

Thought TFW had a good first camp, drew some attention. Will be interesting to follow him this season.
4207 2018-09-19 15:19:00 no one ever accused of BBER of being in cahoots with "Big Oil" for their CPP study (though it did and still does appear the research sponsor AND PRIMARY SOURCE for information, NorthWestern Energy, may have misled BBER's work either by omission or commission).

4210 2018-09-19 15:18:40 In 2015, NDP said they had no control over price of oil($30) so don’t blame us for weak economy.  Now oil is $65-70 and it’s NDP policies that are responsible for upswing in segments of economy?

From methane down to solid bitumen there isn't much that isn't marketable/used/converted.
Depends on source crude-tars and local-far markets. Even sulphur is sold in some markets.

4296 2018-09-19 15:10:59 Dude. You realize  this pipeline is to move oil? To the coast, so it can be put on boats and taken out of Canada, ya?
4297 2018-09-19 15:10:48 I rarely get sick.
1.  Thank my mom for breastfeeding
2.  Raw goat milk as child.
3.  Natural Probiotics.
4.  Eat a lot of fruit.
5.  Fish oil.
6.  Herbs.
4298 2018-09-19 15:10:47 Maybe due to changing in P and T from reservoir to surface condition so the oil spilled out of the core. And that is why they use sponge core sometimes.
4299 2018-09-19 15:10:33 わかる、綱と茨木の組み合わせ、絶対いつか見せてくれよなという気持ち…。絶対に殺してやりたいけど話してみたいとも思うっていうの…鬼らしくなってきたと言われる綱への想い…「狂化」を掻き消す男綱…ある意味茨木の宝具を作った男でもあるし…ところで渡辺綱のことはナベちゃんと呼びたさある

4304 2018-09-19 15:10:10 If reallocating tax revenue in a way that benefits poor people is socialism then what is reallocating tax revenue to benefit oil companies via subsidies?
4305 2018-09-19 15:10:06 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
4306 2018-09-19 15:10:03 あやとび！！！
4307 2018-09-19 15:09:58 Recoverable reserves are a function of oil price and cost of recovery.
4308 2018-09-19 15:09:53 and like two days is okay, because a little oil is definitely beneficial at times but when you start to feel like there’s a layer of GUNK on your scalp you wash it. These girls be throwing insane amounts of more gunk on top with dry shampoo SMH
4309 2018-09-19 15:09:44 はちのじーーー！
4310 2018-09-19 15:09:43 HATE GETTIN OIL CHANGES

4312 2018-09-19 15:09:35 Gas prices over $3.00 a gallon. Oil markets glutted. Trump should be fired!
4313 2018-09-19 15:09:29 And all these places have horrible human rights records, could a country make ethical decisions about its oil sources?
4314 2018-09-19 15:09:28 My daddy had bedtime stories about being forced to take castor oil that always left me laughing.  Never tried it.  Hear it’s God-awful. So is Sen Kennedy.
4315 2018-09-19 15:09:20 Wait,girls now use oil to catch men?? I'm not understanding.

4318 2018-09-19 15:09:12 Indeed Doug ..it is a mindset that that needs changing .. 
the oil producing Arab countries live on a different level altogether ...they are hovering in the rich man club up in the clouds!! The rest of us mortals have to fend for ourselves.. and them too if it comes to it.. 
4319 2018-09-19 15:09:12 Stunning beauty.Well this region is famous for oil refinery.
4320 2018-09-19 15:08:41 For people with super curly hair that do not get as greasy they can go longer of course, but when your scalp starts to get that excess oil and that STINK that means there’s probably bacteria buildup
4321 2018-09-19 15:08:37 Shocker!!
4322 2018-09-19 15:08:36 소지창은 무조건 넓은게 좋은듯 그리고 먹을꺼 한두개씩 갖고 다니면 캐나 펫 스테미나 딸릴때 하나씩 먹이면 금방 차니까 후회 안 함..포션 같은건 중독 걱정이 되지만 음식은 과하게 먹이지 않는 한 살이 찌지도 않고 쪄도 귀여우니 괜춘

4329 2018-09-19 15:07:30 Our new trucks in #Odessa reflect @CanaryConnects growing reach in America's #shale fields. We previously only provided hot oil services in the #Bakken. America's robust energy fields are driving the #economy & #jobcreation

4331 2018-09-19 15:07:25 Even worse: the USA is *causing* the growing refugee crisis, not only by escalating war, interventions, regime change, boycotts, sanctions for the OIL'igarchs' private profits, but also by ignoring climate change, which is precipitating floods, droughts, famines, migrations.
4332 2018-09-19 15:07:18 Overbought crap
4333 2018-09-19 15:07:02 The last time I cooked yam porridge it was just oil on top yam, i could do rice, beans plantain with egg and tea

4343 2018-09-19 15:06:03 So do oil and gas subsidies, but solar and wind are much much cleaner and sustainable.
4344 2018-09-19 15:05:46 @walmarthelp I heard something about free mega red fish oil is this correct and if so where can I find more info

4362 2018-09-19 15:04:26 I am currently bathing in three different essential oils. I don’t feel completely healed but I can breathe. I am becoming stronger. Bow down before the essential oil god
4363 2018-09-19 15:04:15 You can use Neem oil as a spermicide before intercourse, and it doubles as a natural lube (it does NOT smell good but it’s worth it.) Also, as a morning after situation, soak a tampon in Neem oil and insert for a few hours, repeat if desired.  you’re welcome.
4364 2018-09-19 15:04:07 I don’t know whose daughter needs to hear this but

Get  an oil change! 
4365 2018-09-19 15:04:04 I am at a cafe waiting for my car‘s oil change, and every single table is full of middle schoolers. 

Did you and your entire class go get lattes before school?? What is this???
4366 2018-09-19 15:04:03 Trump gave SEdef Buyakataman some type of award that she's very proud of. i dont know the details. Sedef I guess did her patriotic duty at Standing Rock. Many left media reporters etc did great work at STanding Rock helping the corporotracy/an oil company,FBi, CIA & local police
4367 2018-09-19 15:03:58 Baroque EV tech def. in the future - it allows status quo of land use, finance, consumption to be maintained. Limited litium reserves, and deep reliance on oil and gas for EV manufacturing, maintenance, and infra mean this is a fancy hood ornament on civilizations motorcar.
4368 2018-09-19 15:03:50 ก็ไม่ได้สวยเท่าบาร์บี้ด้วยนะเอาจริงๆ
4369 2018-09-19 15:03:43 Some of them don't use too much oil 
4370 2018-09-19 15:03:38 CBD oil doesn’t contain THC, which is the part of marijuana that gets you high and the munchies lol
4371 2018-09-19 15:03:13 Africans with the right ideas always assume, albeit naively, that the west supports them. Well, your plan to move the economy away from oil is against their economic interest, including that of the billionaire behind Sky News. So, they’re not your allies. Be aware if this!

4390 2018-09-19 15:01:20 my mom tried to suggest some essential oils to help get rid of a lingering cough and yes it turns out you can use "snake oil" four times in the same sentence
4391 2018-09-19 15:01:19 I know no other article. But the one I posted also says that our govt is not transparent on what they disclose. Seems funny doesnt it? I think its time to tell JT that he should live up to his promises. Reveal the types, extent and value of & remove all subsidies to big oil.

4397 2018-09-19 15:01:03 I see the UK government have decided to scrap any payments for excess energy produced by solar for your home. Yet happy to subsidize the oil and gas industry and allow energy firms to rip you off and push you further into fuel poverty
4398 2018-09-19 15:00:49 Yes. Put in air purge line with valve. It will aid in cleaning. Oil free compressor.
4399 2018-09-19 15:00:47 Now my oil bottle missing all of a sudden
4400 2018-09-19 15:00:47 It's other way around. All countries you mentioned gets richness because of oil. They don't have any other thing. Wait till all oil vanished. They become tribals. You are wrong when you say, India is begging , it's trade. Nations import and export.
4401 2018-09-19 15:00:46 @BLMNational just a thought, shouldn't American ingenuity be able to find solutions despite regulations put in place? Or are we under a "no gas and oil company left behind" program for those that lack the ingenuity to work with the rules in place?
4402 2018-09-19 15:00:45 someone was telling me about Bio Oil?? I randomly have a bottle in my house, I’ll let you know how it is after a while

4409 2018-09-19 15:00:25 Iran threatens the whole world  -- hopefully sanctions will bring down their "government" -- besides their oil reserves are probably vastly overstated
4410 2018-09-19 15:00:23 Attention to ingredients what we eating&using. How we were slaughtered by those poisons? Glucose Syrup, Hydrogenated oil,Palm oil,Monosodium Glutamate,Sodium Benzoate,Methyl Paraben,Sodium Nitrite,Sodium Laureth Sulphate,Linalool.We are suffering this pure massacre for more money

4413 2018-09-19 14:59:43 That is so amazing! Thank you for sharing! We are happy you have found such a great use for this wonderful oil!
4414 2018-09-19 14:59:40 If I break your heart , na oil spillage..
4415 2018-09-19 14:59:35 Sometimes wars are fighting bad people who want to take from others. Sometimes imperialism. 

The claim that middle East fighting is about resources is not factual. The US has taken no land, no oil, no resources - just as we did with Japan & Germany.
4416 2018-09-19 14:59:23 Oil money.

4418 2018-09-19 14:59:06 Same way here.   We never had much oil up here and the gas wells are well past there glory days.   There are a lot of operations that have stayed in business solely do to there pump jacks.
4419 2018-09-19 14:58:49 They are so focused on Stormy’s boobs they can’t get any facts straight.
4420 2018-09-19 14:58:34 The first time I had a root canal procedure done, I so badly wanted to ask: “Gee, doc, have we hit oil yet?”

4424 2018-09-19 14:58:06 Difference between Economics & Pakodanomics

Economics - Increase the Gross Domestic Product qualitatively to achieve inclusive development.

Pakodanomics - Increase the price of Gas, Diesel and Petrol to benefit oil companies at the cost of common man #PetrolDieselPriceHike
4425 2018-09-19 14:58:06 Did Ahmed really say “drink water & use coconut oil” when I asked for a personal advice?
4426 2018-09-19 14:58:00 How low can u get!! Have u discovered oil yet, or nearly there ?
4427 2018-09-19 14:57:46 Man this keef oil got a bitch high asf lmaoooo
4428 2018-09-19 14:57:35 coconut oil is what i also was told to use by vummidi ppl after i got my piercing. was supposed to apply and rotate the stud gently every day. helped a lot
4429 2018-09-19 14:57:33 I get in early and stay patient.  Energy sector hasn't been reacting to price of OIL for a few months, but that's not going to stop me from buying a perfect chart set up like that.  All is quiet while folks focus on MJ sector
4430 2018-09-19 14:57:11 I set up an oil change for 8 am tomorrow and I’m already dreading it 
4431 2018-09-19 14:57:08 คำต้องห้ามเหรอครับ
4432 2018-09-19 14:57:06 you live in an oil painting wow who wouldda thunk it
4433 2018-09-19 14:57:00 That's exactly what you've been telling the oil and gas industry, isn't it? Do you mean government should work for the people, or for the oil and gas industry? Or are they "the people"? BTW why wasn't that meeting on your official schedule?
4434 2018-09-19 14:56:56 I hope it involves only a tire patch and not new tires  (I’m also overdue for an oil change but I’ve got an appointment at Tires Plus next week for that)
4435 2018-09-19 14:56:23 หนังสือไม่หาย ม่านมันบัง… บังมิดด้วยนะ หาซะรอบบ้าน
4436 2018-09-19 14:56:07 I would think the oil would make it more savory...

4440 2018-09-19 14:55:50 By failing to fund an adequate amount of affordable housing and zoning the city to facilitate building that housing, Seattle’s leadership has levied a huge “tax” on its working population. What’s worse is that money lines the pockets of landlords and oil barons. #housingforall
4441 2018-09-19 14:55:48 Big foreign oil companies ripping, gouging Calgarians! Market prices for oil, gasoline much lower than before summer and Canadian dollar up! So only reason is to screw us!
4442 2018-09-19 14:55:48 These arguments are analogous to Rogers or Bell only providing high end TV packages because people already subscribe and no one wants the cheap bare bones package. Eastern Canada Imports about 3/4 of their oil.  Half of that from the US and half from overseas.

4446 2018-09-19 14:55:25 Don't forget the NRA & each voter that did the #DemExit to Vote Trump. We're ALL Russians, ran by Russian, eating Russian dressing, while watching RT & admiring our oil painting of President Putin on a Bear eating Salmon (actually children separated at border & taken to Russia).
4447 2018-09-19 14:55:12 Why don't you tell him how his country should treat women, demand that they follow Canadian rules on oil/pipelines and insist that they follow our moral system. That works for trade.

4449 2018-09-19 14:55:04 So an update on my car... it seems that the piston rings are plain shot, and my engine is consuming oil heavily.  Long story short I'm starting to look for a new (or slightly less new) vehicle.  I am still getting to and from work okay though so that's a relief.  Wish me luck.

4451 2018-09-19 14:54:58 Based on what?  Global Oil consumption hasn’t faltered, and is projected to increase year over year for as far out as we can realistically forecast.

4470 2018-09-19 14:53:18 PSA!! Mattress prices industry-wide have risen due to higher prices in steel, oil, and costs of importing. 

We still have plenty of stock before any changes in price, but don't wait too long!
4471 2018-09-19 14:53:17 The Iraq War was not about oil. Despite fighting here for almost a decade, the USA got no oil out of the conflict. China, which opposed the war, was the biggest foreign beneficiary of what became Iraq's booming oil business business industry, following the end of the war.

Economics - Increase the Gross Domestic Product qualitatively to achieve inclusive development.

Pakodanomics - Increase the price of Gas, Diesel and Petrol to benefit oil companies at the cost of common man.

4523 2018-09-19 14:47:25 U.S. crude weekly inventories down 2.06 million barrels,not as much as expected. Total American oil inventories are now at their lowest level since February of 2015.

4545 2018-09-19 14:45:32 I was also under the impression that the Netherlands gave very generous subsidies for heating oil etc to horticultural businesses a few years ago, which meant that a lot of UK businesses couldn’t compete, so they either went out of business or changed what they produced.

4571 2018-09-19 14:42:40 Kavanaugh has been vetted by the FBI for White House positions, had back ground checks prior to becoming a judge. No issues. Now the Dems are attacking the credibility of the man by someone sho said something happened 30 yrs ago. A new low even for them.

4576 2018-09-19 14:41:55 I was vaccinated as a child then many years later the deepwater horizon oil spill happened. Are you going to tell me that something that never happened before my vaccination but then occurred after is just happenstance?

Way I see it is beard oil is for when the beard is longer than your body can make oil for. 
I do reckon using conditioner on it is just as good? Maybe?
4614 2018-09-19 14:39:05 That’s great, it’s definitely got some health benefits then! I’ll have to check it doesn’t mess with the meds I’m already on for my PCOS (most things like CBD oil do ) but then I’ll try it x

4627 2018-09-19 14:37:53 Same reason some Americans think coal jobs are coming back. Because Trump promised it. And yes we’re tied to big oil. Big cars, big everything. Didn’t you know it’s a god given right in America to burn fossil fuels? Cognitive dissonance is widely pervasive in parts of the US.

4636 2018-09-19 14:36:53 Lastly, the use for #oil based products will substantially decrease with #EVs due to having fewer moving parts and components. If we equate oil products needed with maintenance, then you will decrease the need for oil based products by around 58%.

4644 2018-09-19 14:36:18 Having said that, inflation has also gone up due to GBP weakening against the USD (thanks to Trump) - which is the base currency for oil and other commodities used as raw materials in manufacturing. So it’s not all QE.

4660 2018-09-19 14:35:07 For some reason, climate science is the one science we choose not to believe in. We would rather believe in the odd maverick (sponsored by oil corps or not) than 95+% of climate scientists. My bet is that more US citizens believe in creationism than climate science.

4702 2018-09-19 14:31:43 Difference between Economics & Pakodanomics

Economics - Increase the Gross Domestic Product qualitatively to achieve inclusive development.

Pakodanomics - Increase the price of Gas, Diesel and Petrol to benefit oil companies at the cost of common man. ,

4704 2018-09-19 14:31:29 Why would Texans vote for their economic doom? 

No genders, straws, or borders might be cute little unicorn like goals of the @DNC. 

But cut oil production? Kills jobs. Hurts families, with poverty comes more crime. 

No thanks to @BetoORourke and the @DNC agenda in this State!

4708 2018-09-19 14:31:10 Sorry,  I least intrested as war and game together is like a amalgamation of oil and water.  Worthless.  It is failure of BCCI & Govt of India both. Allowing and enjoing cricket is a moral downfall.  It is also disregard the supreme sacrifices of our forces.

4733 2018-09-19 14:29:28 Yes, it is definitely a move in the right direction. But I personally would not want to eat anything rolled in the same coating and fried in the same oil as a dead chicken. But some meat eaters might and I suppose it could wean them off meat.

4758 2018-09-19 14:27:07 NOOOooooooo Public sector company employees are paid by their own company.Not from central Govt. They raise revenue by selling crude oil to Govt at international price and make huge profit. That's it.

4761 2018-09-19 14:26:59 But if it is this adjustment, then the timeline should also be adjusted retrospectively. In fact, there is little GDP growth in the graph around 2014. And could oil prices induce a 10-fold increase within a few years? Oil is important for Nigeria, no doubt, but what share of ec.?

4763 2018-09-19 14:26:42 Does anyone know a true and honest source of the world oil reserves including any "hidden" reserves that some know about (offshore Alaska, North Shore, Venezuela and other)?  I think the issue comes down to letting people know just how much truly is left at this current use rate.

4770 2018-09-19 14:26:03 @ikamalhaasan Why shud Govt lower  its tax on Oil? What if oil price keep increasing even after all our tax is pulled back? Wht wil public do at that stage? And what they do then why can’t they do it today, now? Why late? Why after making govt robed of its much needed revenue?

4773 2018-09-19 14:25:53 Not being lied to about oil revenue for one, fiscal transfer, Barnett Formula, Westminster shouldering about 90% of the cost of decommissioning the oil rigs, a Prime Minister that respects the result of 18/9/14.

4778 2018-09-19 14:25:32 Nationalizing a business is a bad idea and it never works.

It destroys the business and industries. 

Look at the oil industry in Venezuela after it was nationalized.

4844 2018-09-19 14:18:49 I had the self same thought.  Mmm Mushroom, Madeira  and truffle oil risotto.

Got the mushrooms out of the fridge, looked at them, thought of Trump and put them back.

Fennel, pea, lemon and mint risotto instead.

4848 2018-09-19 14:18:22 I agree beef is a major cause but 2nd to that is palm oil. Used in countless processed foods, personal care, biofuels and vegetable oil. It’s alarming the number of hectares they plow through but also the emissions that get released doing so because they sit on carbon rich soil

All income is unreasonable if you consider it to be so, and many do find income to be unreasonable. Do we simply accept that?

Still, the law of supply and demand exists

4882 2018-09-19 14:14:22 An adviser to Iran's oil minister said on Tuesday that expected U.S. sanctions on Iran's energy sector could not reduce the country's oil sale to zero because of high demand levels in the market

4885 2018-09-19 14:13:59 Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday that current high oil prices of between $70 and $80 per barrel were temporary and were mainly driven by sanctions, adding that the long-term price would stand at around $50 per barrel.

4890 2018-09-19 14:13:34 For Iran, the timing could not be worse. The country has lost influence over oil prices as other producers have eclipsed its energy industry, which has not kept up with technological advances.

4901 2018-09-19 14:12:17 OIL: Oil steadied, as concerns that producers may fail to cover a shortfall in supply once U.S. sanctions on Iran come into force outweighed an increase in U.S. inventories.

4906 2018-09-19 14:11:51 short answer is the Republican Party (white male party) is beholden to oil/gas interests as a matter of policy,so they’ve cynically promoted anti-intellectualism & climate denialism in the US as a bulwark from profit endangering regulations,by using it as an in-group signifier.

Hence i urge No Oil campaign to be promoted in India
4929 2018-09-19 14:09:21 The private sector shouldn't be limited to the big players. We should carefully scrutinize the role of the small players who do things like mix transformer oil in cooking oil. #ESCRUg18

4944 2018-09-19 14:07:58 Partly Because of GWB the Market took a year to work through the oil uncertainty and the US’ lower reliance on OPEC because of Obama’s expansion of oil and natural gas exploration. But even if you ignore that, you’re really gonna ignore what he did to turn things around? Lol

4984 2018-09-19 14:02:50 Just don't pop the blisters and you'll be okay. Honestly what the doctor said is correct! The skin blisters up to protect the deeper layers. Get better soon (that's not that bad for an oil burn trust)
4985 2018-09-19 14:02:48 They charge $6 for a quart of oil.

5006 2018-09-19 14:00:33 My mother, so old she doesn’t give a rip about politics anymore told me “Hillary says these allegations should be investigated, it’s a political farce. That snake oil salesman husband of hers had multiple accusers and she called them all liars.”
5007 2018-09-19 14:00:30 Diezani was as corrupt as those managing the oil sector presently. If they don't have anything to hide, why can't they be as transparent as the "corrupt" Diezani?
5008 2018-09-19 14:00:27 If there is a policy solution the language would be interesting. The same policy could be used against the oil and gas industry for polluting nearby public lands and streams. It could be argued that this would "tax" public infrastructure.
5009 2018-09-19 14:00:19 Mentira no toman nuevos, lo que estan haciendo las petroleras es recargar a los trabajadores que ya tienen, explotandolos hasta el agotamiento, sin ir mas lejos hace unas semanas murio aplastado un petrolero de Vista oil&gas (la de Galluccio)

5040 2018-09-19 13:57:47 Sanbhai,  long term oil charts are showing -ve divergence . so it is possible oil may correct now. hp/bp/ioc may show good moves..look their charts also
5041 2018-09-19 13:57:41 True, but knowing about some things let you enjoy it on a deeper level, either way it never hurts to learn. But Monet, to me, is personal though. My grandma had a lot of impressionist oil paintings hanging on her house when i was a kid (idk if they all of them were Monet, tho)
5042 2018-09-19 13:57:39 Agree, there's just too much money in the internal combustion engine for manufacturers and oil companies to just give in & close down. Who knows how many inventions they've bought out in the past & put into storage.

Every day I think "How much more damage can he do?" and every day another national park gets leased out for oil drilling and a few hundred more families get destroyed. This is shit that won't self-repair, it's permanent. He needs to be stopped.

5062 2018-09-19 13:55:51 When using the oil methods there is a lot of playing around with the ratios so that you can get them right for you. If you have dry skin, use less castor, if you have oily skin, use more castor. It’s a science

5072 2018-09-19 13:54:46 It only depends on how dry your skin is Bc castor oil is an anti inflammatory and can cause the skin to dry out if too much is used. That’s why the ratios lean more on the sweet almond oil side, not the castor oil but it is essential if you want the break outs to decrease and dry

I’d call that an immense progress. We should judge #EV tech vs what we’re doing now with burning oil - not vs a utopian zero-foot-print scenario.

5085 2018-09-19 13:52:15 Wow :)  thanks to the superfoods and the cbd and black seed oil I have not been sick in a long time!! Love it :)
5086 2018-09-19 13:52:12 The east coast doesn't ban tank traffic because the majority of oil that is refined there comes from overseas. North Sea and Middle East.

The reason THAT happens is because Quebec stands in the way of building a pipeline thru the province.
5087 2018-09-19 13:51:51 Just met these 3 mosquitoes sef. While one distracted me singing in my ears. The other 2 were busy drilling for oil on my skin. As I catch dem sef... I can’t fit shout. I just tell dem make dem carry Wetin dey get waka. Man must eat.
5088 2018-09-19 13:51:49 I'd like to know why gas prices are spiking even with super low oil prices. Since it isn't because of the pipelines sending our domestic production overseas there must be some sort of collusion between refiners or distributors. Won't expect Donald to help, he's probably in on it.

5093 2018-09-19 13:51:22 Actually it’s beef, soy, palm oil and wood that are the four major causes of deforestation. I agree that some factory farm animals are treated terribly, which is why people shouldn’t buy from that company. People wanna eat meat, fine, but why bear?
5094 2018-09-19 13:51:22 It’s the oil
5095 2018-09-19 13:51:14 #angs More adverts from the rainbow crew. Exactly how much oil over what period of continuous flow time, has already been extracted from each of these test wells? Mmmm don't expect anyone will provide an answer.

5111 2018-09-19 13:49:39 Chavez & Maduro have collectively been in power for 19 years. Whose fault is it for not diversifying the economy? Venezuela took part in the oil markets for decades before while seeing nothing like the crisis happening now. #corruption #narcodictadura

5155 2018-09-19 13:44:34 First thing Chavez should have done is tear out all the palm oil production and disperse the already twice stolen land back to small farmers and Indigenous. The oligarchs he replaced created this dependence on the price of oil and palm oil. Would be just as bad if they still led.

5170 2018-09-19 13:42:43 Salmon is so good! For those who might be reluctant to cook this fish (because of its natural oil), you can microwave it, using almost any seasoning.
5171 2018-09-19 13:42:30 Crude Oil Price is not that much high. Rupee is falling against Dollar. But still Petrol Diesel Price is not, as Modi Govt and State Govts are using Petrol Diesel as Looting Medium. Taxes are above 120%. Means Petrol @ 40/- is taxed @ 50/- and sold to consumer at 90/- Shame.

5204 2018-09-19 13:38:09 Look up PDVSA, which was one of the better managed state-owned oil companies in the world, and its current demise, especially after a military general was appointed to run/manage it. Of course, the  lunatic’s policies towards Venezuela do not help the situation.

Iraq war

Oil Drilling and Pipelines

That's just off the top of my head.
5265 2018-09-19 13:31:25 @narendramodi Why cant some of Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Lakshwadweep developed as fish farming hubs.  Instead of investing in exploration of oil and gas in the deccan traps and andamans, why is govt investing in russian fields?.
5266 2018-09-19 13:30:59 Respected Arun Jaitley, you are requesting that the prices of rising oil in the country be pleased to reduce tax, there will be great mercy. The country is expecting you, when its burden of inflation will be reduced soon.

5268 2018-09-19 13:30:53 When it comes to pipelines what has @AndrewScheer done to convince/influence his Quebec Liberal base to see the error of their ways? What does Scheer intend to force compliance if elected? Is there a plan to back his claim he'll reduce dependence in foreign oil? @CPC_HQ Liberals
5269 2018-09-19 13:30:49 I love butterscotch pudding...  getting oil changed, and this lady in the waiting area is like a whack-a-mole - keeps popping up and out of her seat. Can’t sit still. She’s gone now.
5270 2018-09-19 13:30:38 It would be nice to see both sides represented fairly. I personally am a huge protector of the environment, and my family has been sustained by oil industry for 2 generations.
5271 2018-09-19 13:30:35 Gargle with salt and coconut oil miked with warm water. Take Probiotics, Vitamin C, Zinc and Echinacea. I also drink tea make with ginger, cayenne, lemon, apple cider vinegar and honey. If you can stomach it add garlic too. Feel better soon.

5278 2018-09-19 13:29:40 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong, and is cheaper than shop-bought manicure oils.

5287 2018-09-19 13:28:01 These sanctions are much more focused than the Iran and Irak ones. There are no prohibition of oil exports or any embargo or imports or like the Cuba case, no credits at all. The dictatorship is so bad managing money that even the Chinese do not want to send more money to it.

5289 2018-09-19 13:27:44 After small refinery exemptions the renewable volume obligation on a % basis is less than 10% of our fuel supply... The difference between industries here is that the oil guys have a monopoly on the supply chain. We just want access to the market to sell a superior product

5291 2018-09-19 13:27:16 Except that the objects of this charity, wastage of much needed public funds are not noble.  The World Bank has repeatedly complained about Nigeria spending its oil wealth on less than 1% of its population.

When you commit actions like this and, you make moves against me, my son and my parents..  you have to go!  You cannot ride around in a car full of my gas and oil and think you have the audacity to rule

5314 2018-09-19 13:24:13 Fine Pay for everything yourself then bye bye Barnett formula and oil is less than 65$ A barrel.
5315 2018-09-19 13:24:09 Imperial is directly funding climate change. The environmental impact of its implicit (and often explicit) support for the fossil fuel industry far outweighs its campus emissions - oil firms use the trusted branding of Imperial to legitimise their social and political power.

5319 2018-09-19 13:23:51 Does this apply to oil cleansing too?
5320 2018-09-19 13:23:50 I am not afraid at all. I am embarrassed. You must think Ontario's debt is OK too, no problem there either. Head in the oil sands.
5321 2018-09-19 13:23:47 While delays are never a permanent solution, delaying until a more permanent solution is found is a reasonable strategy. 

E.g. awareness will reduce the usage of oil based cars until more permanent solutions (all cars electric) are found to reduce pollution. Same with garbage.

5327 2018-09-19 13:23:17 Disagree! The Bond girl is also the main villain, kidnapping of M, geopolitical intrigue re: oil and terrorism, and Bond with a sustaining injury. TWINE has its flaws (Denise Richards, reverse engineered ski jacket) but is IMO the best Brosnan.
5328 2018-09-19 13:23:14 Agreed! Lots of fatty meat, butter, olive oil on everything.  To me MTD: mostly fish, meat, cheese, olives, olive oil added to everything tomatoes cucumbers. But MT society changing. More junk &processedfood.  My MedT friends who are obese or T2 eat lotsa bread & snack all day,

5348 2018-09-19 13:20:06 @Greenpeace 1/3 - Hello, i got a question about oil. Since the biggest deep earthquake at  Sun, 19 Aug 00:19:38, u can see the earth is moving in waves, now the ozonlayer is low till at least november, if u look at the data in the past. 
We always talk about climate change..
5349 2018-09-19 13:20:05 Rupee strengthened against the US Dollar today on reports that the RBI was considering a special Dollar window for oil importers.
5350 2018-09-19 13:20:04 @greenpeace 2/3 ..that everthing is all about the CO2. But u can see at the data that the ozonlayer is almost the same over the last 20 years. So is there a report, something that prove that oil/gas drilling dont hurt OUR planet. And can it be that the earth just need oil ??,
5351 2018-09-19 13:20:02 FYI: It devastates crop production, reduces renewables potential, impacts flora & fauna, causes severe health issues in humans. So we're minimizing 1 issue & creating several others. But hey....BIG OIL is making money from it,  so the politicians will be all in.
5352 2018-09-19 13:20:01 @Greenpeace 3/3 Can't we demand that they stop drilling till there is something of a prove, that the earth dont need oil, some report say we have 53 years left of oil, but who said that the earth dont need at least 20% oil/gas?? 
The Earth is from us all !!
5353 2018-09-19 13:19:59 my hair grows so fast now aaaah :”)) i use the ecostyler coconut oil gel and it promotes hair growth AND smells good asf so if any naturals on the tl want to help ur hair grow: try it it’s under $3 and a little goes a long way

5357 2018-09-19 13:19:42 Government bond prices ended higher today, as RBI set better-than-expected cut-off prices at today's 100-bln-rupee OMO purchase auction. The rise in Rupee on report of RBI mulling special Dollar window for oil companies, pushed bond prices higher.
5358 2018-09-19 13:19:19 I bet you can make a rainbow with six colors. Try it with oil pastels. Probably could get away with only 3 if you're clever!
5359 2018-09-19 13:19:18 Went to the shop up the road and found a 500ml bottle of water costing £3.99  when I asked why it was so expensive "oh it has CBD oil"  we're being drugged

5365 2018-09-19 13:18:07 One of the most important activities a church can do is teach the ladies to change tyres, and check for water and oil by themselves.
5366 2018-09-19 13:17:50 Mr Ed was a horse I think lol,I am no oil painting but she would have to pay me to have coffee,I would not touch her with a Barge Pole
5367 2018-09-19 13:17:49 Agree on this and willing to bet That Iranian oil will be sold at discounted price  through Iraq
5368 2018-09-19 13:17:44 Pulling out the fuel oil tank and putting in a new furnace today. 

Between the dogs, a 2 year old and bean harvest starting while old crop movement wraps up I'm going to need some stronger drugs.
5369 2018-09-19 13:17:19 Oh yeah i figured that’s what you meant. But every red neck oil fan out here thinks there’s an eastern conspiracy but they aren’t smart enough to see more than half the country lives in Ontario and Quebec
5370 2018-09-19 13:17:12 Oil is being stubborn at ,69.43
That's not good ok it's inflationary and slows things down
Good for texus maybee
5371 2018-09-19 13:17:09 Wait... we can't peacefully assemble to protest anymore against a large company like an oil company? Does no one read history any more or the constitution? #history #amendmentrights
5372 2018-09-19 13:17:07 Yep #TOM update due any moment that testing of the units prior to active site testing has happened. Then it’s a couple of weeks to perhaps what if successful is almost an inflection point for US Onshore Oil & Gas. 

Folk not getting the significance of these tests.
5373 2018-09-19 13:17:03 Viji was not pulled by a 25 kilos heavy bucket or 10 kilos heavy rugs, or even poured oil over her hand. 

I support Yash. She had a strong grip even on oiled buzzer. Aish is not strong, but Viji wouldnt have survived 5 minutes with the same strategy.
5374 2018-09-19 13:16:45 Pernah pakai and my face rasa gatal2. Stop terus pakai and bagi dkt my sis try. Dia pakai okay je. Maybe my skin x sesuai yg ada tea tree oil kot.
5375 2018-09-19 13:16:45 Scotland pays £50b direct receives back £30b to Westminster coffers that does not include all Scottish goods and products exported through English ports or gas and oil revenues that go straight to Westminster coffers, so like I said pertion your MP #DissolveTheUnion scared are u?

5378 2018-09-19 13:16:27 What would all that gaz and oil do under sanctions and embargo? Nothing. Once their economy is destroyed, the regime can't last. Iran cut its funding to hizbollah by half due to sanctions so yes, 400 million in dark days makes a difference to them.

It's almost same for mein last 5 years.Point is,if Govt sunsidises oil it has to pay by either curtailing spending on Infrastructure or borrowing from Market,which increases Disc deficit,int rate and slows down Economic growth.

5414 2018-09-19 13:12:41 I agree, it would seem that the snake oil was not thoroughly tested by the seller. But just as modern medicine has proved, not all medicine works on all people. Some people have to try a differnt a medicine. Likewise with various practices.

5416 2018-09-19 13:12:15 What's the main unit of currency in oil/gas markets ? the petrodollar - and if the petrodollar is no longer used by large economies such as Russia/China for that trade !!who will suffer as a result ??? some vicious economic wargames going on here
5417 2018-09-19 13:12:11 The pound will drop. Which for a net importer leads to inflation.
It also increases any debt we might have in Dollars or Euros.
And as oil is handled in dollars, it also increases the cost of fuel.

Simple really.
5418 2018-09-19 13:12:11 So it is sacrilegious to hold an opinion about oil other then yours Jason.  Thought conservatives were all about free speech? Or is that only when it comes to the Rebel  media type of free speech?

5512 2018-09-19 13:00:19 Must. Have. Coffee. And by coffee I mean STRONG coffee! I love @DeathWishCoffee - it’s the strongest yet never ever bitter and no aftertaste oil either! Iced in the summer, steaming hot in winter!!!
5513 2018-09-19 13:00:17 I’m probably sitting here for 2 hours waiting for an oil change. If anyone wants to scoop me, breakfast is on me.

5515 2018-09-19 13:00:03 The taxes are not the problem hence not the solution. eg. the amount deducted for stabilization fund is zero. If all the taxes were taken off the oil companies will replace them with their losses from forex. The Ghanaian consumer is a price taker & unless that is changed

5518 2018-09-19 12:59:58 I must repeat. These specific sanctions are about new credits to the government. Because almost all the money from the oil windfall was wasted and robbed, this set of sanctions seek to put the brakes in new loans to the thieves. But it does not affect the oil sales in USA
5519 2018-09-19 12:59:55 Ok I ate a fruit parfait, drank cbd oil, kombucha and did yoga... if this shit don’t start working imma just have to stay fluffy and go with it bc this is a lot of work 
5520 2018-09-19 12:59:48 Data is the new oil. Once a waste product, now there is a price on it. Taking it wholesale from any country, as well lifting meta data, amounts to theft, as well as pose security problems. Cough up I say. It will just make the world go around faster.

5543 2018-09-19 12:56:36 I think they didn't prepare adequately at the time they should have prepared. By the time they realized this fact it was too late.

5570 2018-09-19 12:53:10 The obsession with “non-essential” imports is surprising. The real reason for the widening trade deficit is oil and gold imports. Besides, invisibles surplus is rising. So, dollar demand-supply gap will narrow in the coming weeks in any case.

5622 2018-09-19 12:47:46 Correct. That's why preaching truth claims without evidence is immoral, regardless of who does it.

As you so often say, religion is not based on evidence. We can't prove a god exists. We are not 100% sure it is legitimate.

That's why preaching religion is selling snake oil.

The APC govt has handicapped the people of pain state with poverty to the extent of changing their minds with one derica of rice and #50 sachet of power oil

5644 2018-09-19 12:45:14 I need an oil change
5645 2018-09-19 12:45:09 오! 정말 좆같다!
5646 2018-09-19 12:45:00 Speaking of olive oil, I came across someone the other day with severe bronchitis, and their homeopath advised them to treat it by putting cotton wool soaked in olive oil in their ears...
5647 2018-09-19 12:44:59 I have an oil painting of one of Nadia Lapusta's early simulations in my bedroom!
5648 2018-09-19 12:44:56 Including cholera which happened under the watch of mdc led @cohsunshinecity you also see biti tweeting exaggerated prices of cooking oil in a country he claimed his life was in danger. It looks like a @ProfJNMoyo strategy to constantly refer to @edmnangagwa as illegitimate in
5649 2018-09-19 12:44:56 Not really. You still have the oil combustion emissions (the EOR is counting against the coal plant). Whereas if you instead scale up low Carbon sources (including nukes) with EVs you don't have this problem.
5650 2018-09-19 12:44:56 Very reasonable comment @NannyMcCairn but others not so much and think we need to turn off the oil taps tomorrow. Looking at every other energy transition has taken +50 yrs and that was with a x2 energy density improvement. I'm not seeing that now so could take even longer...
5651 2018-09-19 12:44:49 ‘It still staggers me’. Perhaps try learning some basic maths then. Maybe start with the snp being £30bn our on oil estimates in 4 years. See if you can work out what that equates to for each person in Scotland.
5652 2018-09-19 12:44:47 Sorry for the oil fellas he couldfall into the water
5653 2018-09-19 12:44:44 If the product doesn't work, I can't morally sell it. It would be morally wrong for me to sell a product that i was not 100% sure it was legitimate. If a person isn't sure of what he is selling, then he is selling snake oil.
5654 2018-09-19 12:44:39 If we stand together and work together govt and scientists  there can be big thing achieved. Airbus 330 MMRT oil tanker aircraft can be used for whole requirements.@narendramodi @DefenceMinIndia 6 AWACS 360 degree on A330 MMRT oil tankers is ready to go. @DefenceMinIndia

5665 2018-09-19 12:42:45 The cost of solar up front per watthour is about 3-4 times more expensive coal, oil or nuclear, however there's two points

1) you won't pay for fuel imports 
2) you will pay for battery storage

Can't go 100% solar with our current level of tech, too much lithium is needed

5676 2018-09-19 12:41:38 Where was this water stored and how was it mistakenly pumped into oil tankers? This cannot be a case of negligence, something is very wrong in this plant!
5677 2018-09-19 12:41:32 Cameron fally (sp?) On project avalon has some strange insights into all this. He velieves they want to recreate Assyria, destroy it, and force their messiah to come. They want a huge swath of land, and that oil under the golan heights. Thank God the Russians helped syria.
5678 2018-09-19 12:41:26 Think about how un-American it is that we aren’t allowed to sell #E15 year round and the only reason we can’t is that the oil industry doesn’t want the competition.
5679 2018-09-19 12:41:21 ... it’s a fresco, actually. Not an oil painting.
5680 2018-09-19 12:41:13 Good news! Venezuela will now be exporting one million barrels of oil to China every day! They are also investing $1 billion into Venezuela to help us. “We are on track to have a new economy, and the agreements with China will strengthen it."

5702 2018-09-19 12:39:20 As a student of cancer pharmacology, medical statistics and  and is actually involved in a legit cancer clinical trial - legalizing cannabis oil will not be that simple!

5732 2018-09-19 12:34:38 That’s just about the most inane comment about oil and the U.K. government I’ve read this week. Offshore direct to ship oil sales not credited to Scotland. Scotland spends approx £35bn but raises over £62bn in taxes

5736 2018-09-19 12:33:51 "The Scottish figures do not include output from offshore oil and gas extraction."
5737 2018-09-19 12:33:49 What you doing to help those of the big cities on both coast that use the oceans as their garbage dumping ground & if your working to replace oil base fuel for vehicles you must development of oil base fueling station to support alternative fuel vehicles
5738 2018-09-19 12:33:42 Ok I have arrived. Where do you keep your holy oil?
5739 2018-09-19 12:33:39 And Putin quite possible just wants the sanctions on his country lifted, wants to sell his oil, wants NATO to stop sneaking up to his borders, and wants Russia to be respected as a great power and not a subordinate. Does that make him a “swell guy?” No. Is he a unique threat?
5740 2018-09-19 12:33:39 I read of a case overseas where cooking oil was being mixed with engine oil. Similar measures were placed, bc it can kill millions. In that case perps were found & convicted. Tampering with food just as serious as the other crimes you mentioned; diff in nature, but just as bad.

5744 2018-09-19 12:33:14 For US corn crop, over 50% goes to ethanol production.  Then there is palm oil for EU biodiesel (big driver of deforestation in Asia).  Soy is also used for biodiesel production, about 25% of US soy oil goes to this.  It is non-trivial and there is no funding for alternatives.

5748 2018-09-19 12:32:36 you want the math? Ok. The average Iranian oil tanker can carry about 4.2 million barrels, so 11 of them would be roughly 46.2M barrels if you want to be exact

5752 2018-09-19 12:31:01 Trump is creating a bubble to give the impression that he brings results. Typical snake oil salesman. That shit is going to fall like a house of cards. I see a nasty recession down the road worse than the housing market crash of 2007.
5753 2018-09-19 12:30:58 #RKH PMO. Their free cash flow for 2017 was $71m it was $580m in the red in 2016.Their operating costs are $16/bbl. PMO produce 75,000 bpd that’s 27million bbl PA

So $10 on the oil price is worth $270m to their cash flow.
Their free cash flow for ‘18 will probably be $300m

5775 2018-09-19 12:28:05 #RKH I think there’s a misconception that pmo are going to get bent over on finance. I disagree. The price of oil being where it is & on the increase has put pmo in a much stronger position cash wise. These are the numbers as I see them:-

5780 2018-09-19 12:26:46 Olive oil is free.
5781 2018-09-19 12:26:43 The interest rates are unfairly high, often countries repay debt in assets such as cobalt or oil.
5782 2018-09-19 12:26:38 Ha ha ha. 2016 is the only election I my life that I voted a straight ticket and the only time I did not vote for the Republican nominee.  I knew 45 was/would be a conman and a snake oil salesman. He is now worse than I thought. Nothing to be cockey about. Just the truth.
5783 2018-09-19 12:26:33 I think your getting mixed up .... ‘Coltar’ (or Coal-tar) is a traditional soap bar, often dropped by convicted criminals whilst showing at her majesty’s pleasure ...
‘Colter’ is an area on the South coast about to hit the headlines following massive oil discovery ..
5784 2018-09-19 12:26:19 Tilray now has the same market cap as @encana ... it is trading at modest 170x 2021 earnings. Why would anyone want to own an oil stock trading at 15%+ free cash flow yields at today's oil price when they can buy that???
5785 2018-09-19 12:26:09 I took the picture showing they cover up the check plug for the gearcases. They are oil so not as bad as what grease would be to try and check

5790 2018-09-19 12:25:17 Every so often, I’ll catch a whiff of oil/grease that smells exactly like München Hbf. And for half a second, I forget I’m in Kansas.
5791 2018-09-19 12:25:16 No hydroelectricity or oil either.
5792 2018-09-19 12:25:10 they're backed by an oil state, so the tv money irrelevant here

5794 2018-09-19 12:24:54 In a highly dense& populous country   like India RAIL shud hve been accorded highest priority even over natnl highways.Rail can support urbanization growth of metropolises with satellite towns.Rail reduces oil import bill. In 70 years we laid <12k km(of 65k km) of new rail tracks
5795 2018-09-19 12:24:54 Every time I go for an oil change they try to get me in a new whip.... my car is brand new leave me alone 
5796 2018-09-19 12:24:40 Please analyze what you're seeing very well and calculate percentage leaps. For clarity, last govt had debt of $26b from 2011-2014 when oil sold at average $104.76 while Buhari's government had debt of $5b from 2015-2017 with oil avg $47.56.
Even if they borrowed $10b more...

5799 2018-09-19 12:24:09 I remember in the eighties on tomorrow’s world they had a Diesel engine that had attached a Perspex spiral exposed to light that yielded powdered algae on which the engine ran in real time . It was said the oil companies destroyed the tech . Ha .
5800 2018-09-19 12:24:07 I'm so surprised, I thought when Wilmar came up with its No deforestation, no peat and no exploitation policy, issues like deforestation and burning of peatlands would be addressed, it had a quite good position during the Sustainable Palm Oil Transparency Toolkit ranking.
5801 2018-09-19 12:24:07 Cold pressed castor oil for my lashes and brows is really making a difference.

All schools smelled the same.  The lingering ghost of pine-scented disinfectant couldn’t quite mask the stale scent of frying oil permeating from the cafeteria, the wood shavings from pencil nubs, and the sharp, almost sour, aroma of fear.

5817 2018-09-19 12:21:58 So did the govt. Arrest the treasurer at AICC headquarters, i believe their headquarters is not 7 * like yours. Why was the govt sleeping since last 1 year, or just a ploy to intimidate and divert attention from Rafale and the oil prices etc.. Which affect the common man.

5822 2018-09-19 12:21:15 Fake oil paintings can be detected because of nuclear bombs that were detonated in 1945, resulting in the emission of isotopes that previously did not exist in nature. If a painting contains those specific isotopes, it was painted after 1945.
5823 2018-09-19 12:20:59 Sure. Just as soon as oil and gas stops generating news I'll get onto that.
5824 2018-09-19 12:20:57 yes!! Going to pick this up today. Also need to stock up on my Immunity Oil since it’s a hypochondriac’s worst nightmare of a season coming up

5835 2018-09-19 12:19:02 Who told u we are 200million?We dont know our population due to northern treachery.When Aremu came in 1999,crude oil was about $17 & he didn't complain. In 2015 when Buhari came in,it was averagely $53.Refusal to save was instigated by mostly APC governors 2day who went to court.

5850 2018-09-19 12:16:39 If there was no war in the Middle East (started for financial reasons; oil and arms sales), there would be no ISIS. Politicians are shareholders in arms companies. They continue war to make personal profit while people like yourselves do the dirty work and while innocents die.
5851 2018-09-19 12:16:20 The number is likely higher, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

5860 2018-09-19 12:14:59 This top fake news representative is laughable as he uses the price of oil of 10 years ago to assess the impact of matters of the last year or so.  Oil prices are up about 40% in the last 12 months.  Idiot bs journalists

My view is that Nigeria can invest our oil earnings to diversify our productivity, education and farming

5868 2018-09-19 12:14:23 Growing up my parents had hot water radiation oil furnace with the add on wood stove. It was deadly but took a lot of work during each summer to make sure the wood was ready for winter. Factoring in time and energy I’ll be happy with the oil for now lol
5869 2018-09-19 12:14:21 APD is only a fraction of the cost. There will be the fare itself plus airport handling fees, the security charge and, depending on oil prices in the months ahead, a fuel surcharge.

5885 2018-09-19 12:12:01 Plenty of countries export huge amounts of oil (Canada, the United States, Norway) but their economies don't collapse b/c they don't piss away all the revenue for a narco-kleptocratic ruling elite while everyone else starves.

5912 2018-09-19 12:09:33 The answer is the same as to “if Norway can create a savings fund from oil revenues, why not the UK?”. In short because partisanship trumps collective self interest.

6011 2018-09-19 11:55:50 ...funny, we were selling a hockey sock full of it before  got into the pipeline business. And as supply decreases, price will go up, making our oil an even better option.

6021 2018-09-19 11:54:53 And remarkably, the price of #oil in the United States has risen only modestly while gasoline prices have essentially remained flat. The current global oil price hovers around $80 a barrel, $60 below the highs of a decade ago.

6053 2018-09-19 11:50:04 Modi made oil prices lower in 2014. Modi was even given Abdul Aziz award in 2016. This was not coincidence. Saudis funded congress and Modi threatened military consequences in 2014 for interfering. Arabs reduced oil price and increased FDI. How else FDI grew 70% b/w Fy14 & FY17?

It was not shale oil but Modi That is why sudden decline happened between July-December 2014 in oil price. But oil price had to go slightly up for Arabs to survive. No congress hand

6127 2018-09-19 11:39:43 I mean, for modern pizza we expect something like tomato sauce and/or cheese but those toppings became commonplace only like 2-3 centuries ago… in hindsight that may be the only big difference.

From what I read, herbs (and maybe oil?) were common toppings since much earlier.

Me thinks Trump is moving away from Germany and made a deal with Poland. Most likely something to do with pipelines/oil/gas maybe. U.S pissed the Germany deal with Russia.

If this were the case the U.S could pull from syria

6283 2018-09-19 11:16:16 The dollar has benefited from weak oil prices and increases in the monetary base.  These things cannot continue forever.  Look at how many fiat currencies are beginning to fail.  All of those are backed by USD.  That is a sign of the volatility that we will inherit at some point
6284 2018-09-19 11:16:06 No, that was precipitated by their over-reliance on oil exports. Same problem that Russia, Saudi Arabia, etc have dealt with for several years, though they didn’t have as many of their eggs in one basket.

6311 2018-09-19 11:12:06 For dosage, I found that 20 drops diluted in water was pretty effective. It might have been a tincture, which is a little different than oil, but I think you’ll still want to dilute it or cover the taste.
6312 2018-09-19 11:11:56 Russia is only three years away from maximizing oil extraction output before costs and taxes drive down production, Russia’s energy minister has warned.

The Russian economy has relied on its key export oil in the face of Western sanctions that weakened the ruble.

6317 2018-09-19 11:11:13 With oil at $78/bbl and fuel inflation at 23.6%, we're still wanting for an answer to who was responsible for selling our oil reserves at $28/bbl in 2015? Then oil was trading at $52 resulting in a theft from taxpayers of >R2 billion. To date not a single person held accountable

6339 2018-09-19 11:07:16 Currently using a recipe that reads “before cooking, ensure oil is the correct temperature”. At no point does it tell you what temperature that should be in degrees Fahrenheit or Centigrade. Just “correct”.

6355 2018-09-19 11:04:21 Rasta, there is no shortage of oil. Iran will sell oil at $10-15 in the black market. They always did that. Iranian oil always found a customer at a steep discount.
6356 2018-09-19 11:03:59 Presently none have any value other than speculation. Some experts predict oil does not flow in clay so your calculations are speculative and possibly misleading. The cautious here will be waiting before considering this gamble : indeed more a gamble at present than certainty.

Staying in the EU.
Ship building on the Clyde.
Inland Revenue jobs to remain.
Carbon capture at Peterhead.
Nearest thing to federalism.
Lead don’t leave. (EVEL certainly prevents that).
Support to the oil industry.
Is time you delivered.

6600 2018-09-19 10:22:10 I am so tired of eating junk food.
I'm so tired of food that isn't cooked with olive oil/baked. Take me back to my home in Durban because this is definitely not it. 
6601 2018-09-19 10:21:51 So UK inflation rise is significantly down to Trumpian USA aggressive policy towards Iran which is ratcheting up oil prices. Plus rise in $  as QE unwinds. Not caused by workers' wages.
6602 2018-09-19 10:21:22 KEVEVAPI produced purified Foot and mouth disease oil based vaccine through grants from the government.  A total of 430,000 doses were produced

All the 430,000 doses of vaccine expired with the institution losing about kshs 92,450,000. #VeterinaryInstituteGraft
6603 2018-09-19 10:21:16 If you can't trade a small stack you won't be able to generate profit constantly with a large one.

6608 2018-09-19 10:19:53 Big oil have had their day. Now its time for consumers to choose, and they seem to want to refuel at home or while they shop/eat/etc. All that expensive infrastructure is not needed. Just use the power grid we already have.
6609 2018-09-19 10:19:49 Nigeria is still heavily reliant on oil revenue derived from export, while the revenue derived from  export of agricultural products has increased, it is still a far cry from achieving the levels of a truly diversified economy. @Ahmed_M_Makarfi

6612 2018-09-19 10:19:35 Yes, on converted oil rig platforms in the North sea. The death penalty for anyone who commits a terror act that results in inoccent lives being taken.

6614 2018-09-19 10:18:48 I have never observed bamboo growing on nickel laterite soil. It is worth a try but don't get too excited yet. Palm oil plantations do fairly well on nickel laterite soil but yields are less than on volcanic soil. Palm oil is a profitable industry for laterite nickel rehab.
6615 2018-09-19 10:18:36 Ugh. Add some oil of oregano. It might help clear things up!
6616 2018-09-19 10:18:28 Please excuse @elonmusk 's typo. He wrote "Funding secured." When he really meant "@Lucid_Motors funding secured." It's good to have oil friends ! $tsla

6630 2018-09-19 10:15:46 There are various grades of oil used for different purposes, so US would still need some ME stuff. Sadly UK refining could be better, then we wouldn't have to shop globally to get all the oil types we need. Plus, if we left ME, who do you think would replace us?

6632 2018-09-19 10:14:47 The existence of a market in palm oil ensures more rainforests will be cut down. The same way that a market in ivory ensures the extinction of elephants. There is no sustainable palm oil.

6654 2018-09-19 10:09:48 Some palm oil producers are worst than others. Big companies are responsible to ensure they use sustainable palm oil. As a consumer you the have the choice to buy ethical products.

6728 2018-09-19 09:55:50 The only problem is they will probably cook if in the same oil as the dead chicken meat so most Vegans wouldn't eat it. But then most people who care about their diet would never go in a KFC in the first place.

6730 2018-09-19 09:55:25 The Economy is still very much dependent on crude oil. They have done nothing. How many tubers of yam did pa Audu export? How many bags of rice did he send to you? You are in SA working, come back to Nigeria and get a job. God bless our YOUTH for their Patience, Hope and Struggle
6731 2018-09-19 09:55:18 No it’s not. Telling people what they want to hear, like a snake oil salesman, is a main reason you got elected. If you didn’t put up a scumbag and a liar, just like you, you wouldn’t be having issues. But you liked that he would vote that you wouldn’t have to answer a subpoena.
6732 2018-09-19 09:55:18 Haaa you are about making matter worse.. Does he know what is called XENDER or what it's used for? Just tell him/her to turn ON his bleaching cream cup that you want to send him some acid reduction oil for his senses which has been washed away by Bobrisky mixture

6739 2018-09-19 09:53:50 If you’re just getting into it start with a simple a face wash, cleanser, tea tree oil (if you struggle with breakouts) and a sunscreen with atleast SPF 30 (avoid the ones with titanium dioxide they’ll make you look ashy) add any serum you like to cater to your skin needs.

6761 2018-09-19 09:48:50 सत्ता पक्ष और उनके अनुयाई बेशर्म हैं।जो स्पष्ट दिखता है, उसको पूरी तरह नज़रंदाज़ करते हैं। जब पैटरौल अंतरराष्ट्री crude oil की कीमत बढ़ने से चवन्नी महंगा हो जाता था तो सड़कों पर लिट लिट कर जाती पीटते थे, अब बिना वजह की कई गुना लूट सही लगती है।यह ठगी ही है असली देशभक्ति।
6762 2018-09-19 09:48:46 Iran is the culpritt because it spoiled the stupid Israeli plan to destroy the secular Syrian State and let AlQaeda run Damascus as they do in Libya (and steal the oil).
The AngloZionist Empire was warned beforehand that it would fail.

6764 2018-09-19 09:47:38 After the extreme war which took the lives of many innocent Iraqis, now the people of Iraq are trailed by horrible drought, unemployment, poverty, Iran's involvement in Iraq's political system. Iraq's water become too much political as it's oil. May Allah help the people of Iraq.

6767 2018-09-19 09:46:49 Please don't go down this road. You will loose even more face. Nigeria has too many disaster caused by negligence. I also have watched the documentaries on how the north does illegal refinery and distribution of oil. There is too much dirt on Nigeria online. I can give it to you
6768 2018-09-19 09:46:22 Oh, besides the real people being hurt, rich people won’t have a glorious beachside winter home to run to.  Boo hoo.

6775 2018-09-19 09:45:20 Oil steadied on Wednesday, as concerns that producers may fail to  cover a shortfall in supply once U.S. sanctions on Iran come into force  outweighed an increase in U.S. inventories.

6804 2018-09-19 09:39:24 It has degenerated to the point where these snake oil merchants now employ certified medical doctors to confirm their faith healing claims. This legitimises their lies and pushes more people into ignoring the only thing that we know that cure their diseases

6825 2018-09-19 09:36:08 You are missing a easy point. The bitcoin price is not attached to oil because of volatility. The dollar trades on average between .98-.99

That is the world currency to buy oil. 
If oil goes down to $44 for a barrel the price of the dollars stays within that .98-.99 trading zone

6838 2018-09-19 09:33:32 You said 'The white paper showed a public sector funded from those oil revenues'. No it didn't and now you are on about deficits. The Growth Commission does not 'recognise' the current deficit, it takes it as a starting point for their projections.

6993 2018-09-19 09:02:55 Kim is taking more time until US military withdraw from South. Then Kim and Moon will agree to unify as one Communist Unified country. Mr. President Moon is a bigger problem than Kim. Moon is ignoring UN sanctions, and supporting North food, oil, and money. South is under peril.
6994 2018-09-19 09:02:54 I heard the Tapper blabbering about Cooper while working. I kept squirming in my chair it was so damn awkward and pitiful. CNN has to be trying to find the most whiney unlikeable people possible, they just gotta.

It's abundantly clear that the existence of a market for ivory kills elephants. The existence of a market for palm oil is likewise killing rainforests.

7097 2018-09-19 08:45:32 Good Afternoon! The Indian rupee steadily came off early highs against the dollar in afternoon trade, as crude oil prices inched higher, overshadowing improved sentiment amid hopes that the government may announce measures to stem further depreciation in the currency.
7098 2018-09-19 08:45:29 Don't blow it up. It is temporary due to increased oil prices and Dollar interest rates being high. Once economy roars  as evidenced by recent GDP data the disenchantment will disappear.

7134 2018-09-19 08:40:01 Lol of course not. Just yam and oil
7135 2018-09-19 08:39:56 I still can’t believe that we’ve got to a point in history where it’s financially viable to extract oil from the ground, refine it, make a #plastic [insert item name here] and then just throw it away. That’s both scary and fascinating at the same time. #OneLess #PlasticOcean
7136 2018-09-19 08:39:47 Deregulate petrol pricing but regulate transport fares? Where are our functioning refineries?  Why didn't we nationalize our oil? Who are the key players of the oil industry? What's their link to politicians? Climate change and our increasing dependence on fossil fuels?
7137 2018-09-19 08:39:42 Don’t oil the bots
7138 2018-09-19 08:39:33 ...which became our Achilles heel in terms of failure to implement the spirit of export led growth concept: it’s a version of Dutch disease we suffer from if we replace the oil sector with agri sector in case of Pakistan.
7139 2018-09-19 08:39:32 Oil price, goods price increase because of summer weather - no salary increase.
What will the BOE do, put up interest rates to control inflation when it's not internal inflation. Try and get interest rates as high as possible before Brexit next year to have room to cut rates.

7146 2018-09-19 08:38:12 There's rule and regulations in managing all this. There's global and best practice documented. If you compare basic amenities with managing a plant, we shouldn't have any Oil&Gas plant here.
7147 2018-09-19 08:38:06 Even in lieu of illness, the smell of vaporizing rub is tremendously comforting; camphor, eucalyptus oil, menthol, all the stuff in the standard Equate mixture. The smell of betterment following an illness, the smell of familiar old medicine cabinets. That kind of thing.

Scotland as part of the UK sends say 60 billion to Westminster , and gets 35 returned including "barnet" gift - of its own money back.

Oil theft of 12 billion a year from "unknown origins".

Its their way or Norway...

7200 2018-09-19 08:26:54 Nigeria’s major export is oil and we import almost everything from China. Therefore, if China has to pay more to trade with the US, they will pass it on to us. 
Chinese goods in Nigeria may also go up (if they haven’t started already). I believe the term is ‘imported inflation’.

7203 2018-09-19 08:26:37 Then again, you don't seem to understand how things work. They get "aids" from IMF for instance, in exchange of solely exploiting their natural resources (oil, mines).

7213 2018-09-19 08:24:16 (as I think I wrote in the linked article, the world's current oil industry is only on the scale of 4Gt/yr…so 10Gt/yr is bigger than current oil AND gas industries combined)

7242 2018-09-19 08:17:30 Not entirely. It restricts other countries trading with them, therefore harming their economic situation. US also diluted the price of oil (Venezuela’s main source of income) in an attempt to bring down the Maduro govt. don’t call me “bby” again.
7243 2018-09-19 08:17:26 Yeah its not unfair to refuse to recognise there is 100yrs of oil still to be explored , yeah quite right to ignore the great university's or the food & drink industry & the foodbank yeah jog on

7433 2018-09-19 07:42:10 If this happens teams should pull out of the Premier league he should be in jail the man's a war criminal kill thousands for oil and should also be held accountable for lying in public office
7434 2018-09-19 07:41:47 I’m staying at an airbnb alone this weekend and the African in me feels like I should carry my mums anointing oil 
7435 2018-09-19 07:41:32 He should just remove that ir from his name. Failed to answer and then divert the issue. Before gst we only depends on crude oil and palm oil, after GST implementation we gain another source of income. Then our currency gain strength back.

7437 2018-09-19 07:40:54 That's what makes this global social experiment so (horrifying) interesting. See, right now, it's only some Nazi bigot butthole to raise a concern that oil and water may not mix so well, but it's only fun and games until they show liberals how good they had it with..
7438 2018-09-19 07:40:40 I mean, I would maybe chop off a toe if you asked me, but fighting palm oil use is much much better (signed!)

7445 2018-09-19 07:40:01 The situation is well defined sir...if we don't sustain locally our case will be similar to that of Venezuela, because there's no diversification in Venezuelan economy and the major revenue, which is crude oil, was affected and things become more difficult.. inflation skyrocketed
7446 2018-09-19 07:39:56 All these planned trips to the moon seem to be perpetually in the future. I’ll believe it when I see it. But it strikes me as a good thing that the first such trip will be a bunch of artists, rather than a bunch of hedge fund operators or oil billionaires.

7481 2018-09-19 07:31:30 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and powerful politicians.
7482 2018-09-19 07:31:29 Placing sanctions on oil export, which is 95% of the country income, definitely hurt ordinary citizens by starving them quite literary. Sort of like taking Saddam out of power without hitting Iraq. 500,000 deaths later....still an idiot.

7498 2018-09-19 07:27:50 One issue I have with this factsheet is where it says that a hazard only becomes a disaster when it impacts upon a community.

7669 2018-09-19 06:50:22 Yep, packed their bags, told the oil delivery guys where the oil tank was and boarded a plane to Spain. By the time they got back they had a full tank and the weather was much better.

Moral of the story - set phone reminders to check the oil tank!!

7683 2018-09-19 06:47:15 It's inevitable. When oil comes out of the ground it's a mixture of all sorts of different hydrocarbons+sulphur and other stuff. 100% is used. If the low sulphur fuel is separated for cars in cities that leaves the nasty stuff over. It gets burnt in ships where few bother to look

7801 2018-09-19 06:27:12 The fact that it's tied to Petro, and that countries can't buy oil w/out exchanging for dollars isn't what necessarily backs it. Eventhough without this scheme it would collapse. "The full faith and credit of the US government" i.e. the taxpayer is the only thing backing it.

7936 2018-09-19 06:01:42 In my opinion there are 3 groups that made on this. Top ex military officials,  politician and their cronies. The like of Babangida  with sharing of Nigeria oil wells to his people,  Tinubu made Lagos and southwest by extension  a personal investment.

7944 2018-09-19 06:00:53 We just nationalized a pipeline that isn’t getting built. I don’t know that nationalizing oil and gas is dealing with the issue.

Secondly, thoughts on the mob diluting the olive oil for better margins?
7960 2018-09-19 05:56:37 But we can agree that an East/West pipeline would give oil and gas companies the opportunity to sell to other Canadians instead of them buying our product from the US or worse, regimes with Human Rights atrocities.
7961 2018-09-19 05:56:23 heat oil, add mustard - let it crackle. Chopped onions, chillies go into hot oil, saute a bit. add potatoes, let them cook. crack an egg in, scramble it around (sort of burji but not), add schezwan chilli paste. cook em off. add water and as it comes to boil, dump oats in.

7970 2018-09-19 05:55:09 some of my relatives import crude palm oil and refine it to sell to processed food industry.

8004 2018-09-19 05:48:22 To be fair Dougie, no-one appeared to forecast the sudden drop in oil price. What I feel was the worst thing was treating it as a regular fixed revenue stream, and not acknowledging that the price was volatile. Of course, SNP later claimed that any oil revenue was just a bonus.

8058 2018-09-19 05:36:14 Yes they can. But due to the election in coming up the central government has been increased the oil prices.
8059 2018-09-19 05:36:12 Every recipe for toum I've found sounds right, but it's white... I think the green part happens if you mix the oil first instead of last? I'd have to test it out, but even if it doesn't turn green I know it's just as tasty.

Why? There's no shortage of oil? We drill our own. We are getting squeezed more and more every day. No excuse, no reason for this. Total B.S. We need to build refineries in CA. But that won't happen unless John Cox is elected Governor.
8066 2018-09-19 05:34:30 Yeah, Wikipedia says it was founded by Al From, and a bunch of democratic governors. It does say that oil companies benefited and gave money to the DLC, but no paper trail to the Kochs. As a reminder though, the Kochs are in everything.

8210 2018-09-19 05:08:36 Bet it taste good! Your family is so lucky!!! I'm scared of the oil when cooking so I rarely do so that's why I find people who are good cooking amazing. 
8211 2018-09-19 05:08:17 This oil diffuser got the whole house smelling gooood
8212 2018-09-19 05:08:12 Thanks for the oil, but i think coin would be good
8213 2018-09-19 05:08:08 บพ.นี่กล้ามท้องมาทุกคนจริงจังอ่ะ... ซี๊ดซ๊าดมากกก
8214 2018-09-19 05:07:37 Well I just ordered on oil cooler so let’s see how that goes.
8215 2018-09-19 05:06:53 Explain why, with all the their finances they were in dire straits after oil prices dropped in 2014 the PCs had a large deficit and had to be bailed out by the Trudeau Libs after they took power, you young fool.
8216 2018-09-19 05:06:47 tenho absoluta certeza que será uma repetição exata do que está acontecendo na Argentina...deficit de 12% do pib, credito internacional mingua, sobe o juro, pq o gov tem de captar nacional, economia trava, sem cortes na casta, oil/gas/luz UP, preços UP, dolar UP...e negacionismo
8217 2018-09-19 05:06:44 And that was against a group of Oil blue liners pretty lame tonight
8218 2018-09-19 05:06:35 Yeah it's just the waste fluid from giving a cake an oil change, there's not even a real recipe to follow
8219 2018-09-19 05:06:32 Western sanctions & a major drop in oil prices during the recession(that, as a result of the aforementioned sanctions, Venezuela has not recovered from) are more damaging than faux 'socialism' since Venezuela was arguably *more* 'socialist' under Chavez & the GDP was highest then

8226 2018-09-19 05:05:03 There’s going to be another recession ... obviously cause things happen cyclically but this market and system is unsustainable get off the bit coin hype ( which is backed by nothing by the way) and invest in some commodities specifically gold and oil #Facts

8238 2018-09-19 05:02:49 Next time you discuss Indy with an undecided or fragile yes voter just point out the one big lie that the @theSNP told in 2014. They over inflated oil revenues by £30 bn, Scotland would have been f_cked. There is nothing else to discuss as this is factually correct.

8255 2018-09-19 04:59:38 This is the problem with UCP. You put party over province. You wont admit she is right, that AB oil needs other markets. You want the pipeline to fail, just because it is NDP in power, and then Kenney can try to be the big savior (the narcissist that he is).
8256 2018-09-19 04:59:14 sana oil !
8257 2018-09-19 04:59:12 Especially at oil funded schools like U of C.
8258 2018-09-19 04:59:11 A few things you could use are tea tree oil, apple cider vinegar or even crushing aspirin (or Tylenol) and applying it after cleansing your face.

Baking soda is also a good exfoliant for getting rid of acne scarring and pimples.

8260 2018-09-19 04:58:54 The estimated economic impact of firearm industry is $42.9 BILLION. Like oil, imagine such a powerful market suddenly being throttled, it could cause economic collapse. They run the numbers on these things, if it'll cost too much to lose then it's red light.

8269 2018-09-19 04:57:27 it was during one of his interviews, he said the car could be driven up on a ramp, the battery pack gets unbolted, dropped below and a new one put in, I imagine it being like the oil change places where you drive over a pit. the swap could be done in 10 min or less

Not because it would be good for Alberta, but because you want her to fail. You wanting her to fail is more important than what is good for Alberta.

8296 2018-09-19 04:52:39 We are Yet to see a govt, (besides oil rich Brunei), which does not collect taxes. Issues is How much of the tax collected is stolen; Or lost through inefficiency & foolish decisions.
8297 2018-09-19 04:52:09 and that was supported are strengthened by the previous CPC government.....we need to fix what was previously broken. that takes time and focus. There are no silver bullets here. Personally, I feel the oil sands should be shut down. The biggest man made disaster on the planet.

8302 2018-09-19 04:51:37 Wrong. Kenney claims he wants to cut 20% from the budget. He has no policies, no plan, no budget, no grassroots guarantee. Balancing the budget with oil this low and limited markets means cuts. 
He is a bloviating narcissist who is only interested in power, not Alberta.
8303 2018-09-19 04:51:34 Ah, tried it previously—about like eating crankcase oil on your toast, to my palate. But I’m happy for others who believe in vegamite!

8344 2018-09-19 04:45:24 How about a premier of Alberta campaigning against oil and pipelines hiring anti oil activists and MLA’s who wrote books about protesting.  Fact fact fact.
8345 2018-09-19 04:45:23 oil!oil! pinatulan ko lang yaya mo ahaha
8346 2018-09-19 04:45:07 I did answer that I do sell the CBD oil. immediately after you asked. I even said "do you need some? You can DM me."  HUGE conference with a new product coming this Saturday at conference.

For some reason Twitter is really messing up the different threads fo questions right now.
8347 2018-09-19 04:45:05 Read  #Moringa Oil Versus #CBD Oil...which is better?
8348 2018-09-19 04:45:01 He even purchased a pipeline which Harper did not do. I don't like to pay for it but he was stuck. Thanks to Harper the pipeline expansion is stuck. I wonder if that pipeline will go through in the end. Social license just not there. I guess the trains will transport the oil.

8355 2018-09-19 04:43:54 Sweet Orange Essential Oil has a light, sweet aroma with soft citrus notes. Sweet Orange is non toxic, non irritating and non sensitising which makes it safe for all skin types. It is sun safe unlike most citrus oils that are phototoxic and shouldn’t be used if going out in …

8363 2018-09-19 04:43:15 A slight clarification needed. Banana means regular banana or nendhiran? Because I can consume kilos of coconut oil fried nendhiran chips (usually brought by Sabarimalai trip return friends/relatives) in a single take

8368 2018-09-19 04:42:19 Maybe because oil was at $100+ a barrel at the time, and Alberta was doing financially well. And unlike the rest of Canada, Alberta helps out it's neighbours when they need help. Perhaps we will be more careful in the future.

8372 2018-09-19 04:41:37 As of last year, 63 per cent of @Nestle supply chain was free of deforestation including 58 per cent for palm oil

Any suggestions for 100% free of deforestation candy in time for #Halloween? Lots of kids in my neighborhood
8373 2018-09-19 04:41:31 Man, can’t they divest from that dirty palm oil already? Thought the British had true dignity when it came down to it.
8374 2018-09-19 04:41:19 ever sit in a bathtub massaging olive oil into a puffy vest at 9pm?
8375 2018-09-19 04:41:17   that’s all you’ll hear from Rome about this evil act.  Now had the terrorists dropped a quart of oil in their way out the door then that’s a whole new ball game.

8380 2018-09-19 04:40:50 Then why run for the regressive Liberals? Progressives don’t support billionaire tax havens, pension theft, billion dollar handouts for big oil and milk contaminated with growth hormones. If you’re with the LPC, you’re not a progressive, and you know it.

8390 2018-09-19 04:39:41 Do you mean that ad for oil changes?
8391 2018-09-19 04:39:39 Getting my oil changed tomorrow all by myself, if that isn’t adulting I don’t know what is.
8392 2018-09-19 04:39:32 Hopefully Minnesota gets with the program by the time I’m off the leash. Wouldn’t mind walking into the store and grabbing some lemon walker OG hash oil to get things started
8393 2018-09-19 04:39:23 I swear on my life.  The jobs aren't / haven't come back because of RACHEL NOTLEY and her anti-development, anti-prosperity polices.  Literally everywhere else that has oil is booming EXCEPT Canada.  You caused this.  You aren't nearly as 'enlightened' as you think you are.
8394 2018-09-19 04:39:16 YES! SOME WATER AND 6-8 DROPS OF PEPPERMINT ESSENTIAL OIL!
8395 2018-09-19 04:38:55 And the attention will get diverted from real issues of the economy, currency crash, oil prices, hardly any employment growth. While dealing with corruption and scandals is important, using them as diversions from immediate and pressing policy requirements is dangerous.

8418 2018-09-19 04:34:49 diversify income stream and not hoping for miracles. Era of cheap fuel is ending, make sure there is hedge position for oil to minimise impact. A red balance sheet at end of quarter is not good for the stock price.
8419 2018-09-19 04:34:32 How about Stelmach messing with royalties and the cons not investing in the Heritage Fund for 17 years? And Cons thinking that selling oil to the US at a discount was good enough and there was no need for other markets?

8428 2018-09-19 04:33:45 Not sure if this will have the same effect, but I also sprinkle the peppermint oil on the bottom of my tub before I shower if I still have a bit of headache the next morning.

8452 2018-09-19 04:31:18 Again, it's not the main/sole reason. I guess we can agree that there are numerous factors which led to inflation e.g., the trade war between U.S. and China, oil price hike, etc.

8495 2018-09-19 04:26:42 In the oil/natural gas business the companies that handles transport of the products and storage along with associated businesses are termed “midstream” - as our discoveries teams crank up recovery - we are now in need of more midstream capacity -
8496 2018-09-19 04:26:21 RT nadeemhaque: ayeshaijazkhan Dominican Republic, Croatia, Brazil Egypt all higher than pakistan on HDI.  It is not just oil but a deeper failure in our system. Time to think reform. N\build a better system. assadahmad
8497 2018-09-19 04:26:18 I’m shocked beyond belief. CNN are famous for their integrity all over the world 
8498 2018-09-19 04:26:13 @CNN “We can lie and say whatever we want but if someone else does it, they must be stopped. The monsters.”
8499 2018-09-19 04:25:56 Ooooh yeah i have oil skin for sure so I’m probs not the best to ask  have you tried the huda beauty one??
8500 2018-09-19 04:25:50 Isn't it 紅藥水? Mercurochrome, in English, according to Google. Oh and lots and lots of white flower oil my grandparents used to use
8501 2018-09-19 04:25:42 Rendered mink oil is a lovely smell, though not as cheap as lanolin. I bet it would combine fabulously with clove. (Now I want to try that.)
8502 2018-09-19 04:25:39 Foi só um carinho...
8503 2018-09-19 04:25:29 Indeed - but it's less oil pulling and more of a paste. It's been a while now.
8504 2018-09-19 04:25:27 should have just argued that palm oil = money / jungle = no money
8505 2018-09-19 04:25:22 激アツですな
8506 2018-09-19 04:25:22 What do you drink? This is a fake diagram and simply not true. The truth is the PC left us with just a disaster economy despite all golden oil prices $140 + / barrels they have sold. They could only plan to build a private suite on legislature for PC leaders.
8507 2018-09-19 04:25:18 I honestly have to stop putting coconut oil on everyday. I’m a whole almond joy to these mosquitoes.
8508 2018-09-19 04:25:18 do you have coconut oil?
8509 2018-09-19 04:25:17 What denomination are you Ellen? And you never answered if you still sell the CBD oil? Are you not promoting it anymore?
8510 2018-09-19 04:25:01 Except that this person was taking CBD oil, which, as the article states, has negligible amounts of THC. It deals with pain without the high. Key difference.
8511 2018-09-19 04:24:44 Cars are not manufactured in every region of Canada. Apply same principle to energy. SK and AB could remain leading energy exporters. Instead of oil & gas, it could be solar power. Of course, decarbonization would have to be a real goal.

8512 2018-09-19 04:24:43 I heard  Tullow is producing oil in Turkana. Why increase fuel VAT then after a while your people loot the money and walk scotfree at the same time Kenyans are suffering.Jubilee Government Tumia...

8518 2018-09-19 04:24:05 I’m gonna day throw some high quality CBD oil in there for extra super good measure, along with the fundamentals of layered detox.  Chelation for heavy metals, iodine for thyroidal & pineal hormone regulation, boron for mineral strengthening of bones, distilled water, & fasting.
8519 2018-09-19 04:24:04 Got stabbed in the arm, had a little plastic tube removed, got some needles stabbed in to numb the area, & another plastic tube reinserted. All so I don’t have to push a baby out just yet. Then went on w my day & got an oil change & a new tire. Obvi I’m a superhero #birthcontrol
8520 2018-09-19 04:24:01 Nooo you gotta fry themmmm !!!!!!!! Grab a pan, put some cooking oil on that shit and fry them.
8521 2018-09-19 04:23:58 Ice packet she only kept outside so wat ? Her strategy.. Viji s strategy was to put oil n tie heavy stuff to hands..  . Don’t even get me started on that memory game , that’s a pure test of smartness n Aish aced it. U can atleast acknowledge that instead of whining
8522 2018-09-19 04:23:43 If you are having a hard time finding a job down east there are plenty of jobs out here in the oil patch. I think the news said there are 15K open jobs in our area. Not all are oil field jobs. Good luck on your job hunt.
8523 2018-09-19 04:23:33 Germany fool you can cook....he believes he will always to eat pasta! you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
8524 2018-09-19 04:23:17 Maybe check into CBD oil. Read about it online first. It doesn't have the THC which is the part of pot that makes you high. I have a friend who uses it for his seizures and has done really well. I'm from Colorado so I have quite a few more options. CBD oil is available on Amazon
8525 2018-09-19 04:22:52 They are trying! Taxes that apply to AB oil don't apply to imported oil, it's economic pressure but the results are the same
8526 2018-09-19 04:22:27 それはもう濃厚です
8527 2018-09-19 04:22:12 I really need some beard oil
8528 2018-09-19 04:22:06 What can be done about this? If Twitter and other social media have a monopoly on information, and are pushing a leftist ideology, then Congress should break their monopoly just like they did the oil business way back when.
8529 2018-09-19 04:21:56 I’ve pried all but like four of these lash extensions from my eyelids. I’ve steamed. I’ve used coconut oil. But, those last bit of them are holding on for dear life.
8530 2018-09-19 04:21:54 So spent a hour literally transferring oil from one cart to the other 
8531 2018-09-19 04:21:52 of essential oil use is part of a big picture of alternative treatment, and I have never used only oils on any patient - I find it very suspicious when someone approaches alternative medicine only with oils, or defends oils as the oldest. Esters and oils came AFTER herbal.
8532 2018-09-19 04:21:50 The shower + baby oil rub down really makes me sleepy AF.
8533 2018-09-19 04:21:39 This is all well & good but it isn't how capitalism works. The lesser skilled & lower paid jobs will be transferred somewhere else. Look at the oil palm industry & see how slow we have been at innovation due to our addiction to lower-paid foreign workers.

8541 2018-09-19 04:20:27 i remember some smart fellas used to argue that sabah and sarawak should not worry abt deforestation cos palm oil also pokok.
8542 2018-09-19 04:20:20 Root vegetables such potatoes needs 20 to 30 min;tomatoes,squash, mushroom,eggplant,onion (cut them into small pieces) takes a few minutes to cook.First u have to toss vegetables with a light coating of oil,otherwise they dry out.And yes, always wrap them in foil. Bon appetite.:)

ʺ Okay, let me get the cake pan ready. ʺ

       He then released Pride from the embrace, getting the pan and adding a bit of oil and a thin layer of flour to inside.

8549 2018-09-19 04:19:59 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
8550 2018-09-19 04:19:57 It's damn good news.
Got a hunch the Beto-mania is more sound / less fury, but we still gotta turn out the vote for Cruz. Poll today showed Beto at -10%, hope that's right.

8563 2018-09-19 04:18:28 I gave up "expecting" oil stocks to take off, but I think the shareprice will go up alot between now and Q3 of 2019.  But again, I am looking to see $CPG recover to mid $20s within a couple years or so.  Let's see if Bryska executes the strategy stated and if oil prices cooperate
8564 2018-09-19 04:18:23 Our relationship with India is destroyed?

8586 2018-09-19 04:14:57 Norway and Alberta has similar oil jurisdictions, Norway has accumulated an oil fund hitting $1.3 trillion, while the Alberta fund is valued at C$17.2 billion. C$235,000 pr person in Norway, C$4,150 pp in Alberta  We were the third largest oil and gas exporter in the world once.
8587 2018-09-19 04:14:44 Just like the US is now the largest exporter of oil under Trump’s economy, Domestic Hemp production serves the Trump Made-In-America economic agenda.

8588 2018-09-19 04:14:23 Fortunately, I already have an appointment for an oil change on Monday anyway, so I'll get it taken care of then.  I'll just limp around on my donut spare in the meantime.  Sure, I'm limited to 50MPH, but on my commute, I'm lucky if I ever get going that fast.  =P
8589 2018-09-19 04:14:18 we have so many palm oil trees planted, someone who's never seen an actual jungle before might mistake palm oil plantations for jungles

8596 2018-09-19 04:12:59 Agreed. Jennie, I did a simple oil change for the hundredth time and spilled oil all over the place. Shit happens. I love that you have an independent spirit and that you don't shy away from challenges. That shows your amazing character.
8597 2018-09-19 04:12:58 Tell that to Modi, SusuMa, Smriti, Rajnath, Jaitley, javedekar, Mukhtar and others in your party who drummed up such a dramatic protest when petrol prices were kept as low a Rs.67/- despite skyhigh crude oil price compared to what they are now.

8607 2018-09-19 04:11:40 how is rubber even comparable to palm oil in terms of economic contribution today? 1/6 of our land is planted with palm oil, 1 in 20 of the workforce in that sector and similar % contribution to gdp

8654 2018-09-19 04:06:37 I think I've found a solution to my gnat problem. Dryer sheets with lavender oil. Since I won't have the kiddos tomorrow, perhaps I can wash the dead gnats and sticky fly paper resin off my door jamb without the pestilence.
8655 2018-09-19 04:06:21 Surprisingly all the cheegirls and so called historians, journalist, activist etc have all remained silent and not yet come out to defend either Chris or Congress..and even more suspension is SC has not burnt mid night oil to save either of them.
8656 2018-09-19 04:05:44 if you have an u/lta nearby/don't mind ordering online they have some like ~$13 self-waxing kits that I use. comes with microwavable wax in a resealable jar and strips and finishing oil

I use that and heat it with an electric warmer so I don't have to keep going back and forth
8657 2018-09-19 04:05:29 Extra Virgin Olive Oil perhaps?

8660 2018-09-19 04:04:59 Hanerot Halalu is the one I have and the notes are olive oil, beeswax and smoke. It is lovely, subtle and warm, and also smells very slightly sweet from the honey and the flowers the honey was made from.

8662 2018-09-19 04:04:51 Maybe even try heating some olive oil up in the microwave (like under 30 sec) and massaging it into your scalp.

Leave in for an hour and then thoroughly washing out.
8663 2018-09-19 04:04:48 I know you're just trolling, and it's probably pissing off a ton of oil fans (hilarious). But Gretzky had 137 pts as a 19yr old.
8664 2018-09-19 04:04:33 Or. Maybe he uses coconut oil to make his skin silky soft.  I will be happy to rub it in.

8668 2018-09-19 04:03:47 Scrambled is best because you don't want to use oil, the nutrients from the yolk are spread out, and it's easier for them to eat. Never feed them raw eggs, btw!

8670 2018-09-19 04:03:26 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
8671 2018-09-19 04:03:11 The process is apparently called "cold bluing" - dunk the armor in urine to give it an even coat of rust, then soak it in oil for a couple days to let the oil penetrate.
8672 2018-09-19 04:03:08 Yup.  Hey Premier how about the oil and gas fund?  What wasn’t set up by the NDP government but I just bet you will take credit for it real soon. Lol.
8673 2018-09-19 04:03:01 I watched it!! I’ll need to order but the one for oily skin. Candace, can you send me a link for the oil free regimen?
8674 2018-09-19 04:02:43 Hey VB....are their any female oil fans in the Okanogan that are single !! ... on your followers list.... would be great to meet a hot oil fan out here that would rather watch hockey then the Bacholette!!!

That's fair. The burden of proof is not on the accused and if she is not willing to provide more than vague allegations, the process should move forward.
8689 2018-09-19 04:00:17 I'm working on an oil and gas exploration contract for companies in Gabon at the moment so I shall leave all epistemological considerations aside for the moment in order to concentrate on petroleum assets and interests. I'll talk to you later, as they say.
8690 2018-09-19 04:00:17 Oh gawd, isn't this the guy who "co-owns" an olive oil company and was insisting, "Men want to be like me!"?
8691 2018-09-19 04:00:15 Lol.
8692 2018-09-19 04:00:08 Literally spilled a jar of coconut oil that was 1/2 full in the bathroom and now it’s only 1/3 full  JUST CAUSE I WANTED TO SING CHRISTMAS SONGS
8693 2018-09-19 03:59:58 Great idea...why not keep all that oil here instead of exporting it, and get the gas prices down!

8697 2018-09-19 03:59:21 It's a bit expensive, but have you ever tried Mixed Chicks cleansing shampoo?? It gets rid of a lot of my built up oil. Sometimes you can find a sample size for like 3 bucks at the beauty supply

8704 2018-09-19 03:57:53 He completely ignored (more likely purposely omit) the fact that GLOBAL oil prices had tumbled & that #CONmen had ALSO projected a very large deficit for themselves & lost 50k jobs under their watch. To bad ABns didn’t have “rainy day” fund set up 47yrs ago to cushion the blow.

When will you start standing up for Albertans?

We are getting fleeced on royalties.

8721 2018-09-19 03:54:16 Not at all. Also, you would need gallons of clove oil.

Best is to use caustic salts and “brown” the armor.  Then when it starts to get shiny, you just rebrown it.

8727 2018-09-19 03:53:24 Are there any CBD oil users out there who have had success using it to help alleviate pain from cancer?  A dear friend is suffering and I’d like to send her some, but don’t want to give her false hope. Thanks in advance.

People who are low income get more rebate money back from the NDP than they spend on the tax: spending money for the Park! The economy is one if the best in Canada thanks to the NDP.

8740 2018-09-19 03:51:07 It’s nice, and sort of fiddly. Good for swords, but armor (is it plate, or mail?) takes a lot more. The chalk, in particular is gonna be a nuisance; you have to get it out of every nook and cranny, or it gums up with the oil, and grinds.
8741 2018-09-19 03:51:06 May help in improving forex reserves, but won’t hedge against price. Oil price will always be pegged to USD and converted to INR. Doubt if Iran will agree to INR price pegging.

8753 2018-09-19 03:49:30 If you have anything minty-smelling, breathe it in. I get migraines, and peppermint oil helps. It doesn’t get rid of the headache, but it does de-tense the rest of my body, which tends to clench up when I have a headache (and thus makes it hard to sleep).

8770 2018-09-19 03:48:00 Your legacy is dogshit. You are neither a geologist nor a scientist. Youre a used car salesman. 
You work for the oil and gas private companies.
8771 2018-09-19 03:47:41 Exactly how it works!
8772 2018-09-19 03:47:30 “How essential we talkin’ here, oil guy?” -me to an oil guy

8774 2018-09-19 03:47:14 i swear id the husband that would always ask his wife to pick up flour, oil and everything on her way home because i used it all cooking every meal for the week xD
8775 2018-09-19 03:47:10 Hahahaha! Its a collaboration of atsuete oil, salt, pepper, and vinegar blended with coconut  cream. Its a shade, este ulam for everyone.

8776 2018-09-19 03:46:58 Northeast of Portugal, in one of the many tiny villages in that area.

I love olive oil and use it on everything I cook, but the smell of this misadventure lasted for almost a year, and over a decade later, I can still remember the gagging horror of this stench. Euuuuggh.
8777 2018-09-19 03:46:49 Flake is literally begging her to show up.

8782 2018-09-19 03:45:49 Interesting how few Dawn Dish Soap ads focus on its ability to clean food off of dishes and how many focus on its ability to clean crude oil off of ducks. At this point, they should change their name to Dawn Duck Soap... I’ll let myself out...

8786 2018-09-19 03:45:08 This is very simple. Until you hear of commercial aircraft that aren’t using jet fuel, oil refiners will exist.
8787 2018-09-19 03:45:07 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor.

8788 2018-09-19 03:44:59 So my office randomly  give us cooking oil. I don't know why 
8789 2018-09-19 03:44:58 Petroleum Consumption must be reduced by all out efforts Better roads by @nitin_gadkari and all-out efforts by @PiyushGoyal Rail may offer better alternative to attract more passengers 10%Cut in oil consumption possible let experts involve. Create talent pool in each district now
8790 2018-09-19 03:44:44 Punk danced with Oil Man but failed miserably
8791 2018-09-19 03:44:29 Give me $75 WTI and reduce differentials by an average of $3/boe and $CPG would increase cash flow by nearly half a billion dollars annually.  Most hedges roll off in Q3 2019 and better ones can be locked in.  The company has never had more potential then today at 150kbpd of oil.
8792 2018-09-19 03:44:28 All these oil hippies crack me up! “Bobby fractured his leg in 8 places so we went ahead and administered some lavender with pepperment apple blossoms”
8793 2018-09-19 03:44:22 Will, where should I get my news from in this day and age?
8794 2018-09-19 03:44:19 i bought palmers cocoa butter but i really need to get some bio oil i love that stuff!
8795 2018-09-19 03:44:17 Ummmmm, ginger oil does smell like ginger. I smell like I've been cooking at the wok all day. But it does feel good.
8796 2018-09-19 03:44:15 I don't think so, they're all extremely different. But for me it would be acrylics or oil, because you can paint over and over as much as you like.
8797 2018-09-19 03:44:11 @KodiakCakes I had a question for y’all, is the palm oil that you use in your products ethically sourced? And do y’all know where your shipments of it come from?
8798 2018-09-19 03:44:10 Anyway, I made a pasta bake with lots of cheese, olive oil, sundried tomatoes, &red peppers tonight; I'd share it but honestly, it was OK at best. :/ More impressive was last night's mint pesto!

8801 2018-09-19 03:43:48 I do want to say. Our lamps are filled! We know Christ and the Spirit is the oil. Those who have no oil. Do not really know Christ and therefore do not have the Spirit therefore have no oil. Those eagerly awaiting his return our us. Fake believers are the foolish ones.
8802 2018-09-19 03:43:46 My fetish is oil burns all over
8803 2018-09-19 03:43:35 Why Modi Govt has become so insensitive to Middle class. The Fuel prices have hit the middle class below the belt. The FM is incompetent and a Failed minister. Rupee troubles - Oil Boils, Hit the Middle class. Elections are closing- People will teach lesson. Reduce Fuel prices
8804 2018-09-19 03:43:27 Burning oil and gas creates negative externalities that other people have to bear. The idea of a carbon tax is to move this cost onto the people benefiting from the combustion.
8805 2018-09-19 03:43:26 I wasn’t even going to go there.  Rancid olive oil is rank.

On the plus side, thin enough to coat armor, it shellacs, and doesn’t really stink. But all sorts of fluff and fuzz stick to it.

Don’t ask how I know.
8806 2018-09-19 03:43:21 These lib Californians have invaded my town because of the oil boom... We don't want them here in West Texas... Wish they would leave. They're Extremely rude drivers too

8811 2018-09-19 03:42:51 cant invest atm, but i vouch for it. my dad had lymphoma so bad he didnt think he would live 2 walk me down isle @ my wedding 3.5 months later..then he made oil, took it like suggested, and 3 months later dr said it was a miracle and he not only was in remission, but cancer FREE!
8812 2018-09-19 03:42:43 Omg gurl!! I wish you would’ve told me earlier. I was so close to just saying yolo and putting it with my shower stuff and saying it was my essential oil or someshit  but I was scared of not being able to board
8813 2018-09-19 03:42:30 But Nandos and Nasi Kandar is hard to make. And it’s only available at shops and they use various preservatives and flavoring which uses animal fat oil and sugars in their mixtures.

8821 2018-09-19 03:41:47 Right but let’s use O&G to the best we can while we still have so we can have the $ to research alternative fuel sources and be prepared for that outcome not “phase out oil & gas”, shut down coal plants, etc
8822 2018-09-19 03:41:32 Oil and water never mix
8823 2018-09-19 03:41:29 If I may interject about olive oil--my family had an olive grove, we had large supplies of olive oil, and once spilled it in the trunk of a car. You don't want anyone to smell of olive oil, especially in the heat. It's a rancid, pervasive smell that sticks forever.
8824 2018-09-19 03:41:17 Baked hot dogs are good though. Put a little oil in the pan first then let them cook. They get big and crispy like they do on a grill.
8825 2018-09-19 03:41:15 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
8826 2018-09-19 03:41:11 What's your fav oil? Good luck with the rewrite! <3
8827 2018-09-19 03:41:00 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.

8835 2018-09-19 03:40:10 It gets worse. The first thing to know is that I was married two months before and had to move in with the inlaws. We found out the next day my wife was pregnant.  My friends had to drive my truck home and the oil pan was cracked in the sand dunes and my engine was ruined...more?
8836 2018-09-19 03:40:03 This oil I got smell so good

8852 2018-09-19 03:38:44 Free markets are great, except when the government deems one coats good for oil tanker traffic but another coast not good. Seems arbitrary.
8853 2018-09-19 03:38:44 At the risk of butting in, how about neat’s foot oil? Then he’d smell like cow. Sorta.  Or, Alexander found petroleum oil just puddling around, and they used it as an oil for skin, maybe use that as a oil for chain mail?

8873 2018-09-19 03:37:08 Yes, food prices are skyrocketing. Now, there's no justifiable reason for it. Our agriculture runs on oil, which we've got plenty of. But what Big Agri figured out was people HAVE to buy food. So since they won't buy consumer goods, ding them with higher food prices to get the $.

8884 2018-09-19 03:35:55 Hm disini sih katanya semua jenis kulit, also it has olive oil jadi ada properti melembabkannya juga. Karena ini scrub bukan masker yang lama di kulit harusnya gapapa.

Yang penting sih sebenernya setelah scrub/exfoliate kayak gini langsung dimoisturize yang intense aja.

8900 2018-09-19 03:34:29 The worst: 
You & Trump secretly issued a Policy that reads as follows: ##
No private contractor or corporation shall be financially liable for ANY DAMAGE done by them to any property in any public lands . 
Including OIL SPILLS.
8901 2018-09-19 03:34:24 It is clearly implicit that Kavanaugh is including himself.

8905 2018-09-19 03:34:07 I double cleanse, witch hazel for a toner, face and eye serum. Moisturizer for the am/ face oil at the pm. Mask about to 2x a week. Exofoliate before the mask so the mask will penetrate more
8906 2018-09-19 03:33:50 You guys call everything you don't like "lies." P.S. #FatNixon a.k.a. Dotard Trump has lied more than 5,000 times since taking office.
8907 2018-09-19 03:33:46 And it has to be sheep, olive oil dries, so it makes things bind, and then it sheds, and you get rust.  Lanolin is more saturated, so it stays more greasy, less sticky. Ursula just has to accept it.
8908 2018-09-19 03:33:42 Personally, I use a cuticle oil to help promote healthy cuticles and a kind of “polish” that works to strengthen the actual nail body and keep it healthy

8922 2018-09-19 03:31:04 Both Alberta and Saskatchewan use carbon capture in oil extraction. Canada's oil and gas regulations are the most stringent in the world and is the cleanest product yet it is being protested. Utilization of Canada's oil products automatically reduces world emissions.

8927 2018-09-19 03:30:34 tbh I don't think a food is vegan if it's deep fried in the same oil as meat (and I don't think businesses should be able to label it vegan if it is)
8928 2018-09-19 03:30:33 Even more interesting David is that you, a journalist, couldn't pick up the phone to find out from the ATA what their plans are for speakers from the oil industry.
8929 2018-09-19 03:30:27 You made a secret deal with Zlusa Murkowski & Trump & snuck a clause onto the 2018 Tax Bill that sold off all the oil and gas mining rights in the most valuable wildlife area in the US, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife REFUGE
8930 2018-09-19 03:30:09 If the cbd oil doesn't help, you could talk to someone about a specific strain for you. (I'm not sure where you live, or if you know anyone who lives where that's a thing.) I have a friend who's said he'll take me to a distributor because they tailor to your needs.
8931 2018-09-19 03:30:02 iran 1987 was in retaliation to a missile attack 3 days earlier on an oil tanker off Kuwait. panama was to unseat dictator manuel noreaga who was both playing the dea by selling drugs to the us and was implicated in the iran contra scandal. we didn't do anything until the PDF
8932 2018-09-19 03:29:51 So hyper focused on chasing oil we must have missed the memo from leading scientists around the world that mass extinction is imminent without turbulent course correction. Oil or Opiods. We all need a diversion from reality. Pick your poison.
8933 2018-09-19 03:29:42 • oily hair: 
- combine milk, almond oil and oats in a blender (half amounts for shorter hair). once you have a paste like consistency apply it to your hair and scalp for 15 minutes before washing it out thoroughly

Please someone who has tickets for the Boston show and meet and greet and cant go hmu
8936 2018-09-19 03:29:22 I know this might sound weird but try raw garlic and mustard oil. Heat up the oil, add some garlic cloves and massage some on your earlobes and soles of your feet. It’s an ayurvedic treatment and works wonders.
8937 2018-09-19 03:28:53 Dunning-Kruger is strong with you. BITUMEN is more expensive to refine and more expensive to ship. Moreover, India also gets oil from Saudia Arabia which is just a wee bit further than Iran, but still about 7000 KMs closer than Alberta.
8938 2018-09-19 03:28:51 Hey! If we can meet a half an hour earlier I can go on a walk across the street to drop off my dry cleaning. In fact, if we cancel seeing a movie altogether, we could go to the grocery store to pick up some olive oil I need to make dinner tomorrow night

8942 2018-09-19 03:27:37 We now discover what I knew that it should have never happened.The Chaney family profited greatly by harvesting the oil. Stealing the oil. So many soldiers & innocent Iraqi people died and those that survived carry life long scars.There is far more horror because of that war

8949 2018-09-19 03:26:51 If gaps could close on the Utah, LSB & WCS differentials to a normal range, $CPG would have insane cash flows just from that issue alone, let alone if the diffs narrow and oil prices even gain another $5.  Crescent Point will have some of the strongest cash flows in Canada.

8956 2018-09-19 03:25:50 Actually demeaning flyover country, pushing jobs and companies overseas, massive over regulation and burdensome taxes, and lying snake oil politicians like yourself who accomplish nothing save self enrichment is what gave you Trump. Chew on that, lady...

8980 2018-09-19 03:22:55 I keep looking  at everything going on and I keep coming up w/ what seems insane- but then...it’s all insane....... that is  - - - Arctic Oil.    Somehow it’s:    Putin- Spanky- control-money- oil. In the Arctic.
8981 2018-09-19 03:22:42 it's mostly coconut oil, right? that's got to be good.
8982 2018-09-19 03:22:41 yup
8983 2018-09-19 03:22:16 CBD oil is great for older dogs. Cannabis oil (THC) fights cancer in dogs and humans. CBD and THC are both game changers. Hopefully THC will be legal everywhere soon. I hope you and Maggie are able to rest tonight 
8984 2018-09-19 03:22:12 she invaded the cupboard to get the cooking oil.

8985 2018-09-19 03:22:09 the bus in junior hockey always got it's oil changed at @jiffylube. Even today I still get my oil changed there. Got my engine running as smooth as my skating #ad

8987 2018-09-19 03:21:49 They were able to compete. Problem with VZ is your oil industry is nationalized and run by the government. VZ needs to privatize resources to be able to compete.
8988 2018-09-19 03:21:37 “using their own money and United Conservative Party funds for the trip to promote Alberta’s oil industry and express concerns about Indian tariffs on peas and lentils” - Yeah, sounds like a big mess...

8993 2018-09-19 03:21:17 Uuuugggghh  it's so gross that any of these companies even used plastics in the first place. You do know that plastic is made of oil right?? can you please let Canadians know what's in their plastics and consider an outright ban pleeeeeeaaaaasseee!! I hate ANYTHING plastic
8994 2018-09-19 03:21:03 Let's leave $CPG off the list of shame.  Only 15% of Crescent Point's production is subjected to WCS differentials, albeit at slightly more then WCS because it is a medium blend (Fosterton)  The rest of Crescent Point's production is light oil, most of which is Light Sour Blend.
8995 2018-09-19 03:21:00 DM me for quality CBD Oil, has trace amounts of THC so it provides the full spectrum of cannabinoids, but well within the legal limits. Gets you healthy not high.

8998 2018-09-19 03:20:09 The problem is - which salary earner even earns 2milion naira per month in this country? Except you are a politician or one of the top guys in an Oil company. Calling that amount is a disregard to the 39million frustrated youths currently looking for a job as low as 30k!
8999 2018-09-19 03:20:06 Down here in Chile, avocado on toast is about as exotic as jam. Mashed with salt and a splash of olive oil, it's part of an average, normal un-hipster breakfast. It's hilarious to see it become a trendy social statement.
9000 2018-09-19 03:19:57 Wow! You just discovered this? That would be why we've been trying to get oil to tidewater, and Mr. Kenney was no help in doing that when he was in the Harper government.
9001 2018-09-19 03:19:37 OPEC is essentially an oil cartel. Them ramping up production was an attempt to hurt US shale oil production- particularly with fracking. Increase oil supply, drive cost  down so fracking companies couldn’t compete and go out of business. Problem is Americans are innovative.

9042 2018-09-19 03:14:21 In 1931 , (way before Oil boom in Gulf & Malaya/Indonesia) Malaya had 2nd highest Per capita GDP in Asia after Japan. But Malays owned very little. Thats where the Tunkus Abdul rahman & Mahatir come into the picture after 1965.
9043 2018-09-19 03:14:12 Haha ill  give you the other stuff but not oil independence
9044 2018-09-19 03:13:55 Between my summer reading list, Bravo TV, my actual job, my oil obsession, yoga, awakening my chakras, and home ownership, I feel like my Twitter game has weakened. I feel very out of touch with my core group rn.
9045 2018-09-19 03:13:41 Did you start Dervish's book yet? You can have his sword come into the Dowager's City with a shipment of clove oil for the paladins of the Dreaming God.

9055 2018-09-19 03:12:17 I thought that our country bought a pipeline to ship more oil to Asia? and don’t they make plastic out of that oil?
9056 2018-09-19 03:12:06 I remembered that you're Greek and we have very different skin types. You might do better using a linen handkerchief to dry rub your face, then apply 1/2 tsp olive oil to the clean part of the handkerchief and rub it in everywhere. Use a clean linen handkerchief every day. 1/2
9057 2018-09-19 03:11:55 Baby oil works like a charm
9058 2018-09-19 03:11:43 Modern meat, dairy and seafood is just loaded in toxins smothered in salt, sugar, oil and carbs. Unprocessed plant based foods all the way baby! 
9059 2018-09-19 03:11:22 Slight difference between military equipment and an energy commodity. Should the equipment be sold to Saudi Arabia no, should CDN companies buy Saudi oil, no, but that’s the free market every loved so much.
9060 2018-09-19 03:11:01 Spending is natural and realistically the only way teams will remain competitive, it’s how teams gather the funds to do it then gets criticized. IE: oil money, Qatar Airways, etc. Klopp spent his fair share that he rightfully earned/ based on sales he approved.

Tea tree oil - a poisonous mixture of terpinenes and volatile oils - ALL CHEMICALS.

9082 2018-09-19 03:08:55 Welp time to go see what the oil field in Texas is like now thanks Obama
9083 2018-09-19 03:08:28 And Canada doesn't sell armored vehicles that kill civilians. Private companies do. Sounds about right. Except Canada signed that deal, and Canada allows oil tanker traffic on the east coast.

9092 2018-09-19 03:07:13 Did you search out the Twitter thread or that weather station. I suspect you didn’t, not confirmation bias reading those. I will let you know what happens this winter.

Strong container ships have joined strong oil tankers in choosing the Arctic route, so much has the ice thinned

... well, teflon, yes, but I wonder about the aromatic parts.

9144 2018-09-19 02:59:17 @ChrisCuomo The day is going to come when water is as valuable as oil. Why aren’t scientists finding a way to clean that water and send (via pipeline) to the west coast in the Southwest where there is a drought??
9145 2018-09-19 02:58:57 While Trump is getting everyone to focus on the the poverty topic. He is cutting back Obama rule on methane admissions from drilling oil in the United States. With one hand he's waving a carrot and the other hand he's got a knife. The methane problem will lead to more and worse
9146 2018-09-19 02:58:22 After this deep conditioning & hot oil treatment, I look like Trey Songz in 2007.
9147 2018-09-19 02:58:13 it baffles me o! Fed, state and LG are the highest employer of labour.Did they retrench their workers? Next is the oil industry upstream and downstream(new gas stations are opening instead of closing down).Don't forget farming and Nigerians that are self employed now.
9148 2018-09-19 02:58:09 Voting in Texas is so depressing. You never feel like your vote matters. The democrats (except Beto) phone it in because they never hold any kind of majority power and the extreme Republicans keep drinking snake oil.
9149 2018-09-19 02:57:58 I got my Imperfect Produce box yesterday. Today, I roasted every sort of vegetable that was in there - potatoes, carrots, onions, beets, and I think a broccoflower - with a bit of olive oil and salt. I'll be here in the corner, eating.
9150 2018-09-19 02:57:55 Perhaps, but that’s not how it’s being sold to Canadians by the gov’t when they, the owners of the pipeline are ONLY talking about getting oil to tidewater and markets other than the US...which we all know, requires oil tankers out of Westridge. Those are the facts!
9151 2018-09-19 02:57:25 If you expressed a thought more complex than "Oil make all good," then you've used too many syllables.

9162 2018-09-19 02:55:27 If this is triggering, I can only assume you lived in an oil refinery.

9164 2018-09-19 02:55:03 Just hard work. Started from the bottom 4-5 years ago when I left the oil field. Worked my way up to senior management the good old fashioned way. Good work and hard work pays off.
9165 2018-09-19 02:55:03 The purpose of replacing the engine oil is to firstly "lubricate the engine".In addition, oil performance deteriorates due to deterioration of lubrication performance due to friction between metals, soot generated inside the engine, metal abrasion powder, water contamination etc.

9182 2018-09-19 02:52:25 I guess i can say i was productive. Went to galt flea market and found some dickies for work. came home to change the broken door handle to my car, changed the oil, and washed it. Also cleaned the inside if my ps2 for when i want to play some classics. good day off indeed

9195 2018-09-19 02:50:52 Of mine? if you like bleak, try 41 Days. I'm fond of the stand-alone natural disaster novels. Quake, Storm, and Erupt, probably in that order. Everything else lands you in a long series. Saber Tooth for time travel through the Cenozoic, and Slashed for my take on the end of oil.
9196 2018-09-19 02:50:30 The Trump administration has rewritten an Obama administration rule on methane pollution from oil and gas wells on public lands

9198 2018-09-19 02:50:19 Ok I just had to look this up. APPARENTLY 1) in the tech level of your world sand and maybe some white vinegar was used to clean rust off armor, and then it was oiled - either with vegetable oil or an animal based grease. Lanolin was the cheapest.
9199 2018-09-19 02:50:05 Big paying gigs in the oil patch aren’t there like they used to be and confidence has not returned to the O&G sector. Investment is leaving Alberta and Corporate Calgary continues to have a 30% vacancy rate.

Never entertain oil price reduction rather focus on electric vehicles. 
We need to curb pollution.I feel price of Electric vehicles should be low.
Think what will be situation when India stop importing oils
9211 2018-09-19 02:47:35 We already have those that specialize in spilled coolant, engine oil and hydraulic fluid. We finally have the fuel spiller.
9212 2018-09-19 02:47:24 He can refuse to participate in NATO to help defend countries that Putin wants to invade. He can push to rollback sanctions on their oil co., Rosneft. Lots of things Putin would like.

9217 2018-09-19 02:46:42 Of course. I am an American male after all. Actually I'd use any availiable condiment OR salad dressing. (Well maybe not an oil based salad dressing-...wait...scratch that I would use that. Teriyaki and soy sauce too for that matter.)

I wouldn't consider Tesla a luxury item considering it will eventually pay for itself. Most newer model Toyota Camrys and Kias are at least 35K too.

He made peace w/ North Korea because they don’t have oil, or else trump would have made war with North Korea.

9271 2018-09-19 02:38:45 Foreign countries can stop the importing of oil into America: it's been done before.  The sun and wind can't be stopped.

Solar and wind should have been a key source of energy decades ago.  If Republicans truly want "energy independence," solar and wind MUST advance NOW.
9272 2018-09-19 02:38:44 Venezuela has a long history of corruption and oil dominated economy heavily dependent upon foreign imports. Having a pegged monetary system with foreign debts exacerbated issues caused by supply crisis. Hyperinflation was not the cause of their woes, but an output.

9469 2018-09-19 02:11:53 To anyone under the impression this was a good sandwich: I made them with bread-and-butter pickles and the weird natural peanut butter that separates into oil and cement. Delicious sandwiches were for boring popular girls, not Special Interesting Protagonist Girls like me

9584 2018-09-19 01:53:32 Broadly speaking, yes.
Inflation is poorly defined, depends on 'consumer basket' (???). fluctuating price of commodities, and the IRs available. Ex: a speculative hike in oil price will 'inflate' prices of all energy intensive products.

9612 2018-09-19 01:48:20 [ Also, if you have/can get to lavender, the smell of it can reduce anxiety and stress, while also lulling you off to sleep. Burning it is best, especially if you have an essential oil of it, but I promise raw lavender will work just the same. ]
9613 2018-09-19 01:48:09 Absolutely no justification for the massive deficit we have with China. No justification for it tripling under Bush and Obama. Its completely unnecessary for us to give this much demand to China and their Orwellian slave-labor economy. Same w/ oil from Saudi's/OPEC. Fuck 'em.
9614 2018-09-19 01:47:53 You can buy CBD oil for your pets at pet zoo it’s wild
9615 2018-09-19 01:47:27 I think you and your husband need to be investigated for your share of making Millions $ from Haliburton involved in Afghanistan war -- oil, and poppy crops.
9616 2018-09-19 01:47:22 I once used cinnamon oil as a perfume in an attempt to smell like this years & years ago. It...did not go well. 

Feels like I should give it another shot.
9617 2018-09-19 01:47:10 I think coconut oil has made my nails strong like never before! 
9618 2018-09-19 01:46:54 Brian Mason clapped like a trained seal when Tom Mulcair went to Washington - in between running down our oil industry that is.....
9619 2018-09-19 01:46:47 Watching @HillaryClinton on her damage control tour on @maddow still pushing the Trump/Russia narrative. @realDonaldTrump is destroying Russia’s economy with our oil exports.  What he’s not doing is selling them uranium.
9620 2018-09-19 01:46:34 Thank you TRUMP for rolling back EPA rules for oil drilling on US lands. Now my grandchildren can have an all-electric vehicle without losing a bit of pollution.  While you're at it will you roll back your election!
9621 2018-09-19 01:46:30 I use jojoba for my face too! I put it in a dropper bottle and mix with other oils like tea tree for moisturizer or aroma therapy. Few drops plain for the face is great. Also a great carrier oil if you make homemade masks or compresses.

9625 2018-09-19 01:46:14 The same BS ppl selling the same snake oil to uninformed ppl.  @CDCgov and @AmAcadPeds peddle the same Fake News.  They really are just quacks.

9628 2018-09-19 01:46:02 It’ll be fine. Just rinse after. Dude I’ve had so much acetone(main ingredient in nail polish remover) on my skin that I had to use to remove oil based paint. No type of chemical burns.
9629 2018-09-19 01:46:00 Check your Engine oil today.
9630 2018-09-19 01:45:57 We are so glad to know that CBD oil has helped with your homicidal tendencies.  Hopefully everyone will sleep better tonight knowing we are now safe, thanks to CBD!  ;)

9633 2018-09-19 01:45:48 There’s nothing like the crackling sound of dropping a free-range, organic, frozen-solid turkey right into a big pot of boiling oil.
9634 2018-09-19 01:45:48 Rising petroleum prices & falling Rs. has dampened the spirit, while at some level the resolve to not succumb to populism as far as oil prices are concerned is bold, but the situation happened because bold enough steps were not taken in time regarding PSU banks, AirIndia et al
9635 2018-09-19 01:45:42 I would like the FBI to mow my lawn and take my car for an oil change.

Guy1: *looks up car* oh you need Oil A
Me: Cool thanks, anything else I need?
Guy1: Lemme get Guy2 to help
Guy2: Yeah you need Oil B
Me: But Guy1 said I need Oil A
Guy2: Nah that would ruin your car

I hate cars so much
9640 2018-09-19 01:45:17 In the old days they were way better. Now, the chocolate is fake & the vanilla malted middle is full of vegetable oil. 

The old ones w/real chocolate & dairy are quite delicious. Sometimes they are available in the bulk section of fancy grocery stores.
9641 2018-09-19 01:45:13 She can easily do that as she has no morals, where is is Dias, he was another star with the negotiators a few weeks ago, are these people willing to sell out the auto industry, they already sold out the oil industry
9642 2018-09-19 01:45:02 “The chemical industry, unsurprisingly, has been resistant to the notion that the billions of dollars of revenue these products represent might also represent terrible damage to the human body, and have often followed the model of Big Tobacco and Big Oil— /1

9644 2018-09-19 01:44:49 Yeh we pretty much have figured out his bullying tactic negotiations. Won’t work. Canada will survive and prosper. Might be difficult at first. Maybe we’ll just shut off cheap power and oil going south in winter.

9650 2018-09-19 01:43:59 I do believe tis is another sign of the impending apocalypse.
9651 2018-09-19 01:43:55 I'm pretty sure Suncor thinks things are going well too, recorded the highest quarterly cash flow in company history. 

Oil production is at record high levels, an oilsands op larger than Cleveland just opened, a new refinery just opened and $8.5B was just secured for another
9652 2018-09-19 01:43:21 urg i feel like i'm expressing this poorly. in siloam springs in the mid 90s i almost came to blows about the idea that teen girls should know basic car repair (changing a tire, brake pads, oil change)
9653 2018-09-19 01:43:19 We defund trump by talking about his results Economy is booming Consumer confidence is extremely high American is #1 exporter of oil Record taxes collected even with lowering taxes Unemployment record lows USA is a forceful presence again instead of having an apologizer in chief.
9654 2018-09-19 01:42:53 Thought I was gone be sleepy after this bath and oil down but I’m completely up now 
9655 2018-09-19 01:42:19 Oh dear, oh dear. With a straight face you can take money to sell this snake oil.

9660 2018-09-19 01:41:46 Oil and gas had been growing long before Trump and his tariffs are only hurting that industry to lose money. Just because it’s doing well doesn’t mean it can’t do better. A simple google search can reveal that.

9666 2018-09-19 01:40:56 making lotions with rosehip oil. Feels like mixing potions. Smells good
9667 2018-09-19 01:40:55 Do you really want the oil?
9668 2018-09-19 01:40:54 Mark Zuckerberg & Jack Dorsey are like the new Andrew Carnegie & John D. Rockefeller. Like Carnegie & Rockefeller before them, Zuckerberg & Dorsey have formed a trust. The only difference is that instead of oil & steel, it's the Internet & social media.
9669 2018-09-19 01:40:49 Trump has already got WV going better in such a short time. Compared to Joe? More people working, making more, oil/gas, coal miners, etc. .it's a start of moving up than just staying stagnant. Morrisey can be a yes man all he wants. I'll take the results!

9676 2018-09-19 01:39:53 Is palm oil not included in the current labelling system?

Labelling foods has nothing to do with the environmental or social impacts of the companies or ingredients. It just has to tell you what's in it, and the nutritional value.
9677 2018-09-19 01:39:50 You'll be begging for oil and salmon within a month

9679 2018-09-19 01:39:42 Feel your pain. Forest fire smoke in the Pacific NW and other assorted allergies has been heck on my sinuses for a while. Oil of Oregano  and especially Tumeric have been a god send.
9680 2018-09-19 01:39:31 Catchy
9681 2018-09-19 01:39:22 Sauce is just basically olive oil and garlic mixed with pasta water

9693 2018-09-19 01:38:14 my favorite lip mask is pasta with olive oil
9694 2018-09-19 01:38:08 The oil industry can afford it. But stockholders dont like it. This cuts into profits booo!
9695 2018-09-19 01:38:03 Oil and gas is growing on a ridiculous scale. To the point where coal and nuke power isnt valuable anymore. So no they aren't being hurt by anything. And the pipe and iron they are using, thats made by all these failing mills, is the best in the world. You get what you pay for.
9696 2018-09-19 01:38:02 I used an oil painting pen. It will scrap off after awhile, but water won't wash it off. I use hand sanitizer to wipe it off:)

9700 2018-09-19 01:37:40 Trashed the economy every time they were in office.  Destabilized the Middle East in a fruitless bid to control the oil. Sowed hate and dissension in the US.  Raped and pillaged the environment, the banking system...
9701 2018-09-19 01:37:13 Palm oil is safe to eat, but if I understand that it's destroying habit for orangutans then I want to know what it's in and where it's sourced so I as a consumer I have a voice and can influence industry by making an informed choice. But, it's safe to eat that's all I need know?

9703 2018-09-19 01:36:50 We have enough taxes to cover healthcare for every man woman & child. Pur taxes just need to stop subsidizing big oil, Amazon, Walmart, Wall Street bailouts, farm bailouts due to trade wars.
Speaking of war, that's too damn expensive too. We need to limit our war participation.

9706 2018-09-19 01:36:25 I'm thinking that David was the ONLY one that was ever anointed, anointed with oil, told he would be king of Israel; in other words, the apostles were chosen but were they EVER anointed? What do you think? Or anyone else for the matter?

9713 2018-09-19 01:35:42 Solutions aren’t that simple. If the US gov subsidized solar tomorrow and the whole country stopped using oil, the price of crude would plummet, and so would the US dollar.
9714 2018-09-19 01:35:40 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
9715 2018-09-19 01:35:36 Until the early 1970s, what we now know as "canola" was known as "oilseed rape."

So, if you're buying canola oil, you're contributing to oilseed rape culture.

9740 2018-09-19 01:31:36 The problem is that national economies don’t operate in a vacuum, everything is dependent on global trade. If one superpower wants to produce dirty cheap oil and increase crop yields with pesticides, then anyone who puts restrictions on themselves would just become uncompetitive
9741 2018-09-19 01:31:29 दिलदार साहब crude oil की कीमत ज्यादा थी पर सबसिडी जो मिलती थी और उस के बाद जो पैसा आया वोह कहा गया। ईरान का एक पैसा भी नही दिया ।लाखो करोड का कर्ज देश पर हो गया। आज तेल का दाम अंतरराष्ट्रिय से जोड दिया गया है। कम से कम सबसिडी के नाम पर चोरी तोह नही हो रही ।
9742 2018-09-19 01:31:17 I’m not hiding shit. Falsely claiming someone is a racist is actually called libel unless proven otherwise. It would be the same as saying Ford is a lying nut job.
9743 2018-09-19 01:30:44 They dump reserve to bring price down and then build back reserve with negotiations with key players. Now oil is at a close to realistic price .

9754 2018-09-19 01:30:01 I can agree that relative to conventional light oil, bitumen is safer to transport via rail. Not compared to pipelines though, at least not any data I've seen. And the carbon footprint for rail is larger.
9755 2018-09-19 01:29:58 They will still trade with Scotland or they will turn their lights off. We export 3.5GW of power at peak demand to rUK. They also fill their cars with Scottish oil. rUK trade deficit doubles when Scotland leaves UK.
9756 2018-09-19 01:29:49 My hair stylist was talking about 9/11 and how she remembers it as a kid and I wanted to bring up Rummsfeld and Chenney and private military and oil interests and foreverwar imperialism and Bush basically being an incompetent puppet for both those dudes by I didn't

9758 2018-09-19 01:29:36 >We don't need environmental regulations, we have the courts for that."

OK lets sue the oil companies for the harms associated with climate change.

>You can't do that, the costs are too diffuse and responsibility is too attenuated.

THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF REGULATION
9759 2018-09-19 01:29:20 I’ve been using hemp oil with a couple drops of tea tree and lemon essential oil to get my face back together. Your skin always looks so good!

9762 2018-09-19 01:28:53 Hourglass Veil Primer  didn’t help with oil control at all (and I was assured it would), and it made me breakout hella bad which then scarred
9763 2018-09-19 01:28:50 Wonder how much China getting for oil with this $5bln USD loan to pay off their Venezuela bonds creditors? They could subsidize but if you don't keep record and data will haunt you. Saudis were greedy and bullish on oil price but they invest and build their country and palace .

9773 2018-09-19 01:27:15 Job killer in the sense of exporting oil to American refineries when that oil could be refined in Alberta, creating Alberta jobs. Sounds good until the economic reality hits-govt would have to invest b/c it’s too costly for private sector, or it would have been done by now.
9774 2018-09-19 01:26:59 Make a bargain w/ China by exchanging your oil w/ their foods.
9775 2018-09-19 01:26:56 Well, sort of. Note that its effects are mitigated in Norway because of, ironically, its oil industry, not to mention that the impact of the tax is also reduced by exempting certain industries. The single piece of data always missing is a measure of decreases in fossil fuel use.
9776 2018-09-19 01:26:56 There are healthy and unhealthy ways to go about any diet tho. Keto diets put a lot of autoimmune disorders into remission, but there's definitely a difference between eating bacon and butter all day as opposed to healthy fats like avacados and coconut oil
9777 2018-09-19 01:26:52 45 can't destroy our world fast enough! allowing oil drilling in natl parks, killing endangered species, denying climate change, allowing release of methane, refusing solar power development. i hope he is out while we still have a world.

No, I don’t actually physically change the oil. No, I don’t physically order the spark plugs.

9810 2018-09-19 01:22:09 The interview I watched said the US sanctions that go into effect early Nov 2018 prevent India from accessing the Iranian oil. Since we are still landlocked, they will be forced to buy Saudi, UAE or Russian oil. Kinda the point of the sanctions it seems.

9883 2018-09-19 01:12:39 It was! If you want to try making panko crusted oven baked chicken at home, it's super easy. Just the same as using bread crumbs but you drizzle a bit of oil over the pieces so the panko gets crispy. Great to just dunk in your sauce of choice too. :3

9886 2018-09-19 01:12:01 India will never forgo Iranian oil.Makes no economic sense to focus on sending Canadian oil to India. No VLCCs can load here for voyage to India.

9903 2018-09-19 01:09:43 Canada doesn't need China or the US.  They don't need FTA with anyone.  If Trudeau was clever he would lower the dollar, sell oil cheap and he would stimulate infrastructure for industrialist.
9904 2018-09-19 01:09:42 @JeffFavignano watching your motovlog. One suggestion: don't ride in the middle of the lane like that. That's where the most oil from cars is located on the road. Ride where normal car tires are positioned.

9917 2018-09-19 01:07:05 That’s my point re: irony—that, all other things equal, power sector emissions could increase if EVs break through and reduce oil demand, and with it, CO2 demand for EOR (ie CCUS).

9919 2018-09-19 01:06:37 That's one example though. Yeah it's bad but if you give free reign to people, it's only going to get worse. The problem is oil dependence, pesticide use, overpopulation, fracking, the list goes on. When a company causes a major issue, the tax payers pay for it. Makes no sense.
9920 2018-09-19 01:06:33 Russia relies on energy revenues to drive most of its growth. Russia has an abundance of oil, natural gas and precious metals, which make up a major share of Russia's exports. ... It is also the second-largest exporter of petroleum. The main crops ...

9923 2018-09-19 01:06:21 I bought a lavender-flavored vape pen from @danbilzerian's CBD oil company Ignite, and I gotta say, I really really enjoy it. I definitely feel calmer from smoking it.

9928 2018-09-19 01:05:51 2/2. This would reduce our oil import bill and provide cheap and limitless energy. Pakistan needs to start producing solar panels and wind turbines in Pakistan to make it cheaper and do so in partnership with china, they have reached their 2020 solar target already.

9939 2018-09-19 01:04:49 Considering the environmental degradation and stark underdevelopment of the Niger Delta in contrast with other oil producing enclaves globally, is an indication of "state capture".

9943 2018-09-19 01:04:00 Curious what representations made about our oil that the call was put out to abandon cheaper & closer Iranian oil. #UCP supporters who don't see the problem with Jason's expedition confirm my opinion of them. He may have stumbled into a minefield & dragged us with him. #ableg

9954 2018-09-19 01:02:35 I think the CBD oil has had a small calming effect when taken but nothing huge. Although it did seem to work for a headache/neck pain/back pain I had. I tried a pastille but I’m so tired right now that I’m not sure if it’s done anything.

9978 2018-09-19 01:00:00 Water doesn't mix with oil, they rebound off of each other, so when I put the wet fries in, the water made the oil splash up onto my hand and I burned it
9979 2018-09-19 00:59:53 Ezra, I think that horse can only be ridden so much longer. Regime change is coming to Iran, and you can then strike Iran from the list of conflict oil suppliers. What then will be used to market Canadian oil? I suggest buyers showing confidence in professionalism.

9995 2018-09-19 00:57:04 This is a much bigger power grab than you realize. Their goal: reopen Charter of Rights, codify property rights for persons, redefine corporations as human persons, corporations control all resources. Air, water, food, oil and gas, everything. & bc it’s in Charter can’t fight it

10002 2018-09-19 00:55:37 It’s why we’ve never seen 45’s tax returns.  The @GOP is bought and paid for. Not by citizens but by other countries and big corporations. That’s Pharmaceuticals, Oil and Gas, NRA here in the US and from countries making the deals. I’m disgusted and hope for a better USA.

10004 2018-09-19 00:55:18 Culture plays a huge part. Also bajans know tourism is their bread and butter. Same goes for the Bahamas, where crime is “underreported” because they are acutely aware of the impact. We had oil so we cared not about our public image..

10014 2018-09-19 00:53:57 No and why I m going to know this bcz this jumlebaj party and their leader extremely criticize when oil price hiked in UPA era and that time only talk abt common people interest do you know it
