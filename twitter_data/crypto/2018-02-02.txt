1 2018-02-02 23:59:54 It makes perfect sense. The big kahunas are buying the biggest dip - those who probably encouraged the fear in the first place. It's shopping day for the manipulators. There'll be another pump cycle with the same publications and folks praising Crypto as the saviour of mankind.
2 2018-02-02 23:59:49 Cheers
3 2018-02-02 23:59:33 Shopping for a new family home in an area about 4 1/2 hrs away. It’s a bit tough via the inter web and not being there. Any recommendations from experience.
4 2018-02-02 23:59:32 I’d make more $ sending fetish nudes for bitconnect
5 2018-02-02 23:59:26 Correct.

7 2018-02-02 23:59:12 I'm kinda glad there is a war over graphics cards between crypto miners & VR junkies. That's cyberpunk as hell.
8 2018-02-02 23:59:03 Old: "How bout that crypto today kid?!"

Me: Bet you lost more than me today, rough market. Go home and eat with your ugly wife and 2 kids who are apparently taking a "gap year". Ciao.
9 2018-02-02 23:59:02 Digital money (paypal) is not crypto-currency (bitcoin)
10 2018-02-02 23:59:01 If you can't handle Crypto, pack your bags and go!

Wait, um, hellllooo.

Hello, anyone there?

Hello...
11 2018-02-02 23:59:00 At the start of this week I had $1000 in crypto assets.

Today I have just a bit over $500.

12 2018-02-02 23:58:59 #bitcoin $btc
Interested to poll some market emotions-

How do you feel about $crypto right now?
13 2018-02-02 23:58:57 Careful, the crypto crowd gets very leary when a token has real life utility.
14 2018-02-02 23:58:53 Getting the impression that #MainstreamMedia is sending out rather positive vibes right now #Bitcoin #crypto #fomo #manipulate #sentiment $btc $eth $ltc $neo $ark $ethos
15 2018-02-02 23:58:50 ...infact sorry, no crypto has real world adoption.
16 2018-02-02 23:58:45 It isn't and the Media doesn't know anything about Crypto. They only want views and views and views.
17 2018-02-04 23:59:49 Do I lose my LUX if I don't have time to backup? Not anywhere near my station the next 2 days
18 2018-02-04 23:59:20 Very optimistic of you
19 2018-02-04 23:58:54 Enjoy!
20 2018-02-04 23:58:54 Exatley in the words of dads army don’t panic Mr Mannering
21 2018-02-04 23:58:39 Yup. Same here. At a bar in PA watching the game. Keeping one eye on twitter... you know?! Funny how the daily grind used to be work huh? Lmao. Now its crypto education for noobies
22 2018-02-04 23:58:28 #Crypto will not replace fiat, it will run alongside fiat for those who "get it", and those who don't will simply be slaves for those who do
23 2018-02-04 23:58:19 現実に対応しようとすると、施行規則で定められるのはそうなりますね。
でも、費用収益対応の原則と費用は発生主義で収益は実現主義と言う会計の基本に反していますので、所謂当期で計測せよと言うでしょうね。。。
24 2018-02-04 23:58:12 Yeah you bought exactly the wick of the dip. Crypto Twitter is so full of shit.
25 2018-02-04 23:57:58 And the dump.....
#vibe
26 2018-02-04 23:57:57 If $BTC doesn’t hit 10k by end of the Super Bowl I will...... keep waiting for $BTC to go back up
27 2018-02-04 23:57:44 Agree..!!!
28 2018-02-04 23:57:21 To spend you have to pre-fund your channel after having paid a tx fee to open it; this is akin to a pre-payed tab which the non/under-capitalized do not have.  I'm talking about inaccessibility to the poor, not those who casually send $70 like you.
29 2018-02-04 23:57:11 R u betting with crypto to?
30 2018-02-04 23:57:04 Spread of Crypto continues to rise.  When will you get in?  Now or later?
31 2018-02-04 23:57:00 If stocks are scam Buffet and Soros won’t buy any but they put billions in them. They both think bitcoin is a bubble. It is all about value in my opinion. Buying undervalued assets is best. Are stocks and crypto coins undervalued? Who knows lol
32 2018-02-04 23:56:56 @brothercypto
33 2018-02-04 23:56:54 Most people in the crypto buying market right now don't care if a cryptocurrency is fast or not. They want to buy low and sell high. They see that happening with LTC , ETH  XRP etc. That's why they buy LTC. To make money. I am a holder of dgb.
34 2018-02-04 23:56:49 Thats awesome 2 months of investing
35 2018-02-03 23:59:48 I alternate for the most part, but I always go back to these settings, there are more people invested in crypto that aren't "crypto traders" if that makes sense
