47 2018-04-16 23:56:02 Why isn't there a "Dow Jones Industrial Average" for the Crypto market?

-everyone simply uses "Coin Market Cap" as the substitute

-Varying Coin Prices ($8k for BTC, $.60 for XRP) limit the effectiveness of this method

I believe there is definitely a solution to both challenges

if you want to get more involved in crypto just find a small cap project you are passionate about and contact the team.  These smaller teams will take any help they can get and it will give you great experience.

126 2018-04-16 23:41:24 lol "doudou". If only trading view would allow me to update that... 
127 2018-04-16 23:41:22 Correct, but that has nothing to do with trading groups.  And if that is the nature of the Beast then I would rather be on The Winning Side than the losing side.  Trading groups provide that opportunity to people who otherwise wouldn't be able to make it for themselves.

134 2018-04-16 23:40:45 I don’t think there’s false hope. There’s a strict set of guidelines that most little guys are not even remotely close to meeting. Just my take on it, but I think they’ve been pretty up front about qualifying.

150 2018-04-16 23:38:38 if there is that kind of interest(which I believe), wouldn't you think there'd eventually be some type of effort to crash the price to shake that kind of coin out?
151 2018-04-16 23:38:18 Improving scalability without sacrificing decentralization is the current holy grail in crypto. The project that first cracks this nut will be worth trillions. So far DAG and dPoS projects have made *zero* progress on this front.

I guess it’s very important to expand dApps to more users...

153 2018-04-16 23:38:18 Sometimes I pretend I quit my FTJ back in September to go full time #crypto. Then I realize if that were the case, I’d be homeless.

159 2018-04-16 23:37:43 When do you predict the fall of fiat and fractional reserve banking to be? Legacy systems usually take decades to die off and I find it hard to believe the Fiat system will go away easily. Any projections?
160 2018-04-16 23:37:39 Thanks for always being transparent with what you're buying/holding. You're a great help and have reduced my research time considerably. Greatly appreciated 
161 2018-04-16 23:37:20 There are some exceptions it would seem..

163 2018-04-16 23:36:53 Suppoman is making history as an informative leader in the crypto currency movement. We are all very lucky to have him on a daily basis.

166 2018-04-16 23:36:29 Justin said “offices everywhere” - so that may rule this out.  I was thinking more like a MoneyGram but the top tier companies in that industry have already dipped into crypto
167 2018-04-16 23:36:18 We will be the first crypto-currency allowed on that exchange (not a trading platform) because of our grand mission and that we have not exposed ourselves to the wild volatility that comes from the crypto-currency trading markets.
168 2018-04-16 23:36:15 I can’t for the life of me wrap my head around why everyone is so scared of Russia- maybe they’re just remembering the USSR, but they’re FAR from the power of the Soviet military today

172 2018-04-16 23:35:44 Hope you aren't sleeping on the Chinese because they banned crypto. Doesn't mean they don't believe in blockchain. They will be leaders in blockchain in due time. Look for coins with ties with to the Chinese government. #neo, #hpb, #lrc, #man, #bbn

174 2018-04-16 23:35:32 not a great #crypto day today; thank god for twitter and the ridiculous stuff people post; kept me entertained all day
175 2018-04-16 23:35:29 Sorry I don't do price predictions. A TA expert friend who is very good at entries tells me the chart looks ugly and he is waiting for fib retracements. But then WAN has been performing well against the bear market. Holding mine on the wallet and not touching it for a long time.
176 2018-04-16 23:35:23 Doesn’t it just seem so cruel at times? The Bogdonov video is TOO real. It’s like the Truman show, somebody’s watching everything we’re doing. Oh btw, somebody’s watching every trade you make.
177 2018-04-16 23:35:18 Number 5 (GNT) already launched their mainnet. 

I think oyster pearl $prl is a very good buy right now. Had a big drop after an airdrop and heading to mainnet end of april. Low price right now.
178 2018-04-16 23:35:07 Oh, wait till they introduce The Whisperers.
179 2018-04-16 23:34:51 You still have to report it. The theft is a separate deduction that may or may not offset crypto gains. But that’s all on 2018 taxes not 2017. And it’s incredibly hard to claim a theft, it’s nearly a guaranteed major audit
180 2018-04-16 23:34:51 So I guess Ian is in the last phase of crypto retirement.

182 2018-04-16 23:34:27 I’m afraid the news won’t be big enough for most. If it’s not Amazon or EBay it will fall short of expectations for those people. Still a lot of immaturity in crypto!!
183 2018-04-16 23:33:53 Know the real game that’s being played. And it is _not_ within crypto.

186 2018-04-16 23:33:18 I would say even if price stayed the same but RSI is dropping, it’s still a divergence. The RSI is able to drop lower while maintaining the price, and there’s now more room for RSI to grow.

194 2018-04-16 23:31:35 It can’t help him avoid taxes. He’d be reporting the theft on 2018 taxes, not 2017. In 2018 he’d report the theft plus still report crypto. They may offset but crypto would still be there. Theft deductions of that size is a guaranteed audit. So hopefully it’s not fraud

222 2018-04-16 23:27:25 @BigCheds it’s no secret you lost your ass at one point on TRX. My guess is you FOMO when it surged early in the year, bought in at $0.25 and now you are in a HUGE hole. If you were half the crypto expert you think you are, then you’d see the potential with TRX.
223 2018-04-16 23:27:12 I’ve just sold all my BTC. Hope you’re right

239 2018-04-16 23:24:08 Guys, a real use case, digital cash, isn't this what the purpose of crypto was ? Why you all hating or waiting for failure. Mass adoption is what we as a community need to work towards. I just don't understand where the haters come from. Sad !

243 2018-04-16 23:23:32 And the idea that $1 USD has $20 impact on btc price? Where the hell does that number come from? Anyone who is way in the green and facing a huge tax bill can just hold ($0 taxes owed). This also assumes everyone has all their money in crypto and no cash to pay a tax bill. Nuts.
244 2018-04-16 23:23:20 Sorry, I didn't mean you said it... "they" said it. But it is a concern it's not been followed up. however, I'm on UK time so maybe it'll be later?

246 2018-04-16 23:23:11 Disagree man. In a heavily manipulated market being overly ambitious with my entries and searching for bottoms has given me great returns with minimal downside risk. It’s served me better than trading on trend.

248 2018-04-16 23:23:00 My thoughts: despite price falling, there’s been positive net volume compared to the previous close, which means more money has been flowing into the market. Somewhere along the way, even though more money, price has been dropping. Eventually it’ll rise up to the true value.
249 2018-04-16 23:22:49 every coin has a fan following and people are fudding other projects. as long as crypto community stay,divided status quo will be keep winning.

253 2018-04-16 23:22:05 thanks, Jill. this is honestly the most baffling comment i have seen in a long time from a supposed crypto supporter. everything about the petro is the antithesis of crypto. literally *everything* including the $NEO Blockchain.
254 2018-04-16 23:21:52 Spend some time exploring whether you have what it takes to trade, and study crypto. Start with capital u can afford 2 lose. Trading entails competition, self- mastery, and if u succeed, a living w/o a job

288 2018-04-16 23:17:15 The fact most of you are ok with the illegal activities that were going on in the group was not worth being a part of said such group... shows what kind of people you really are.  I'm sure the IRS has their eyes on the most of you.  As for you, your that canadian dimwit?
289 2018-04-16 23:17:08 Crypto community is all talk at the moment. They do have the weapon and if the community was genuine and united they could start a global war on fiat from their couch. 1. Borrow fiat. 2. Buy crypto. 3. Don't pay the loan back.
290 2018-04-16 23:17:07 That steep drop off in the early hours today should keep us on our toes next few days.

294 2018-04-16 23:16:04 Is that Riki Oh?
295 2018-04-16 23:15:54 I believe the only thing keeping it from being any worse is that there are many people buying to keep the momentum going somewhat. Otherwise it’d be another bloodbath like last month.
296 2018-04-16 23:15:49 おっはーです(‥ºั⌔ºั‥ )
東京もどんよりです。
297 2018-04-16 23:15:45 it was worth keeping my ethics and not accepting being spied on.  I don'tt need to deal with low lives like yourself... didn't like the fraud in the group with the multiple accounts you guys were creating for kyber.. & the fact 1/2 of you were americans and illegally buying in.
298 2018-04-16 23:15:44 That’s exactly what I heard, the only choice they have is to come to the exchanges and buy like normal folks.  get ready guys it’s going to be a great ride
299 2018-04-16 23:15:27 I was asked to leave an establishment for not buying something. Waiting for my girl. I'm white as rice.

302 2018-04-16 23:14:45 Hi ! What’s this telegram group address pllllease
303 2018-04-16 23:14:20 You happened to mention in one of your podcasts that <~10% of finance flowing into crypto is institutional. Do you happen to have a source for reference? (Couldn't find one online) Would love to use it in a presentation if fact checked. Thanks in advance.!
304 2018-04-16 23:14:15 Jeff, are you thinking Verge is a good investment? Im an official TDV subscriber and you have helped me navigate the crypto market well.
305 2018-04-16 23:14:15 Yeah we only can wait :)

309 2018-04-16 23:13:49 While researching $EVE it seems that the "crypto" EVE is up 80-100% over last 1-2 days.

Maybe that is a sign for $EVE #ASX to release an announcement on their honey/omni progress and distribution.

@eveinvestments any news coming?
310 2018-04-16 23:13:43 What you guys think, will we see below 200 billion market cap by end of the week ? $crypto $bitcoin #altcoin $coinbase #binance

317 2018-04-16 23:13:07 LOL..500K is like buying 5% of market
318 2018-04-16 23:13:05 Yea it feels very ‘market push’ at this stage still. Once off the shelf crypto solutions are ready (and superior) I think we may become unified behind a ‘market pull’. 

But I can also see outcomes where we remain adversarial.
319 2018-04-16 23:13:02 Welcome to twitter Mike, looking forward to your tweets in my feed. Curiously awaiting what you will have in store for us with Liquid over the coming years.

329 2018-04-16 23:11:58 How can you ignore the chain size? Why you think 'peer-to-peer exclusive' is the way? "Kill banks" attitude? Is that why? With sacrificed decentralization you end up with just different kind of banks.. you escape nothing. I wish you were truthful.
330 2018-04-16 23:11:56 Geovision is cheap Taiwanese gear man, better than the stuff on the mainland but still. Check out Mobotix, it's decentralized and the most secure video platform available. Also, it's made in Germany for what it's worth. Posting your cams is like posting your crypto assets
331 2018-04-16 23:11:51 Worst way to promote crypto as supporting dictatorial corrupted government.
332 2018-04-16 23:11:40 @Lympo_io doing some great works, just heard they are giving out company equity to token holders that buy during their sale. I love it!

333 2018-04-16 23:11:21 Welp, I still have a lot to learn.
334 2018-04-16 23:11:18 Dude... You raged over a 4x-5x coin. After you left they got into icon and wanchain which where big moves. In hindsight it wasn't worth burning the bridges eh?
335 2018-04-16 23:11:09 This type of binary thinking has split the community in some terrible, meme-driven way. 

Just because BCH has bigger blocks doesn't make BTC irrelevant. I'm rooting for crypto in general. BTC can recapture the magic if it scales. BCH is there if it doesn't.

352 2018-04-16 23:09:12 But if OBV is increasing while price decreases, isn’t that bearish as well?

356 2018-04-16 23:07:59 Fiat currency is prone to hyperinflation, double spending on digital, and bank/brokers always charge higher fees on transaction or money exchanges. Crypto also reward ppl by mining could be fair distribution, transaction could be worldwide.
357 2018-04-16 23:07:59 OBV falling with price rising is always bearish, there are no exceptions
358 2018-04-16 23:07:36 That means a lot coming from you and I wanna say thank you for your earlier feedback on my draft. Been learning from you since close to a year now and I'm looking forward to the next one. #dojofamily

442 2018-04-16 22:57:47 Crypto is bullish just judging by the number of scams and bots on all forms of social media.
443 2018-04-16 22:57:46 Damn skippy. It takes two seconds to say "This next item comes from the folks at [insert source]..." Thats it. Two seconds to go from content ripping d-bag to crypto media commentator. It's not that hard, folks.

447 2018-04-16 22:57:25 Slow and steady climb, the best ones. You can notice how it's often uncorrelating from most alts too. Bunch of alts are following this different path, most on Trex/Poloniex.
448 2018-04-16 22:57:23 @JewKorean are you expecting $ICX to dump after the 30th?
449 2018-04-16 22:57:03 Eh the way crypto has been the past few months prices should start to drop here pretty soon. Sure you can bridge two together but you could also just buy a prefab desktop for 1600 - 2500 bucks that has a 1070 ti to a 1080 ti in it with everything else you need. RAM, CPU, ETC..

495 2018-04-16 22:51:59 If you were Switzerland and a large part of your economy was banking fees etc, what would you do in the face of coming cryptocurrency disruption?

Crypto makes it much cheaper to transfer large sums of money, so people use banks less, so bank fees are reduced.

536 2018-04-16 22:46:33 Crypto assets are highly uncorrelated to traditional assets & most funding also occurs in BTC & ETH so in this early stage growth w/intra-financing drives crypto assets into a higher intra-correlation. When asset price decoupling occurs it will mark an asset maturity milestone.

566 2018-04-16 22:42:53 2018年最も大きな変化はお金持ちになることだったつもりなんだけど(現状、叶わなかった)(夏に「絶対」上がるみたいな、根拠なき夢を見るのも私は好きじゃない)

それが叶わなかったかわりに
友達増えた
2017年に比較して、あり得ないくらい友達増えた

567 2018-04-16 22:42:51 "#BlockChain is a nice mechanism,prove of work does not have to be a cryto"
that is 100% correct - was only saying as most people assume crypto is blockchain :)

579 2018-04-16 22:41:56 What do you think about the lawsuit that's trying to force NANO to hard fork to bail out BitGrail users? I think it's super dangerous for the entire crypto ecosystem. If NANO can be forced to do it then maybe BTC could be forced to do it (I know it would be harder but...)

588 2018-04-16 22:40:55 Estimates that 15% of economic activity in any given economy is dark or illicit. Applied to crypto Monero’s usecase as a DNM crypto would mean an eventual valuation converging towards 15% of all internet economic activity.

601 2018-04-16 22:39:12 No idea. I run a market-maker bot, which makes a small profit off each trade, which has led to my initial XRP holding growing by about 8x. But you can just hold if that works better for you. I prefer to actually use my crypto, and invest and grow it.

608 2018-04-16 22:39:03 @Apompliano, Petro is a scam. It's not going to positively impact Cryptos or Blockchain tech. Au contraire, it's putting crypto in the spotlight as a way for corrupt governments to fund themselves. Think Initial Country Offering. @alegw

667 2018-04-16 22:33:47 What i noticed about crypto is that everyone is hopeful. no one is certain.
668 2018-04-16 22:33:44 They may not be able to. For example in China.

723 2018-04-16 22:27:01 yes, the Carolina Panthers are in the sale process now. How can we tap crypto and make it happen?
724 2018-04-16 22:26:59 Whut?? Just no man.. Both Ed and I posted a lot of charts with bottoms ore other setups that made some good traded already. I’m talking about the ones that screamed there wasn’t any money to be made on alts last week
725 2018-04-16 22:26:58 100% correct.  Crypto is a case study in human behavior and we are all test subjects.  Don’t believe me?  Read crypto twitter.
726 2018-04-16 22:26:57 
727 2018-04-16 22:26:56 Why they just dont market buy?
728 2018-04-16 22:26:55 apart from his own money, he has raised around 13 million
I am sure Enron back from the dead would raise that in today's ZIRP environment and crypto currency nonsense
729 2018-04-16 22:26:39 /2 everything that you do whenever you spend it because they can see where the transactions are coming and going from. They saw that crypto markets were ridiculously hot and people were throwing millions of dollars at vaporware and consultants told them it might be a good idea
730 2018-04-16 22:26:28 Agreed. Both sides are loony with their boycotts.
731 2018-04-16 22:26:19 Muy bueno pero me gustaría que hiciera un video sobre brokers, escáneres y tips sobre los mismos. Supongo que hay personas que están en crypto pero no descartan los otros mercados.
732 2018-04-16 22:26:18 Crypto Press Thanks for the follow! What's going on?
733 2018-04-16 22:26:13 Lots of buzz in OTC markets....
We received several messages from trusted sources about buyers looking to buy 200-300-500k BTC but no sellers available.

764 2018-04-16 22:22:40 BTW Venezuela's National Assembly is just as corrupt as the rest of the politicians. In fact the superintendent of cryptocurrencies used to be part of the student movement that tried to take El Chavizmo down.This was not a political tweet but a Crypto Adoption one

779 2018-04-16 22:20:45 I agree with @_jillruth 

Petro is a fundrising for their own government thru a centralized crypto, nothing else. I encourage you to buy Petro if you think otherwise.

The real revolution is Venezuela citizens holding bitcoin to protect themselves from their govand inflation.

800 2018-04-16 22:18:08 Absolutely. Almost everyone I've seen flash their crypto wealth publicly on social media has gotten "hacked" aka Dodging the tax man.
801 2018-04-16 22:18:08 There will alway be people doing stupid things. There’s no explaining it.
802 2018-04-16 22:17:52 Once bitten twice shy my man -
803 2018-04-16 22:17:35 服着なくていいなんて遠回しに誘ってるのかと…笑すみません
804 2018-04-16 22:17:31 daily close at 8k would be pretty good sign; the trade of catching the dip at 7,6-7,8 is feeling a bit crowded; people probably happy to catch it early
805 2018-04-16 22:17:25 It's fake, look at the name handle. Do even send your money. I repeat don't ever send your money to these tweets ever regarding crypto.
806 2018-04-16 22:17:23 This is correct. We will need to upgrade our personal and physical security as crypto grows. For reference, CEO’s of Fortune 500 companies, spend tens of millions per year on their own personal security.
807 2018-04-16 22:17:00 will there ever be one comment about BCH without mentioning BTC? so hostile.
808 2018-04-16 22:16:49 First, they are not hypothetical. Second, if you want to see mass adoption, then the community would need to be welcoming to new people. 

Can you imagine a store with a secret entrance way? That is what #crypto is for most of the world.
809 2018-04-16 22:16:46 you're looking at the wrong BTC

811 2018-04-16 22:16:40 I agree with u ur last words but not above. He is black that is why they are hating on him so much but Amazon did not pay any TAXES, do u know that wtf man..many people envy him for his success... haters dei hard. It is not ur biz to watch him avoid tax or pay it.
812 2018-04-16 22:16:21 Placing bets on validity of #XVG partnership. Volume and price spike over the last hour or so shows who is betting on what. Cashed out a #NEO and took small position. Speculation is that partner is @Flipkart. Could be amazing if @Amazon buys FlipKart from under @Walmart. #crypto

819 2018-04-16 22:15:50 The question is how would they prove possession of anonymous wallets?

These are the weak hands we need who will sell early and push the markets further by buying at a higher price and eventually the Top.

848 2018-04-16 22:11:53 True but problem is crypto has made every chippy ,sparky and plumber a TA expert and they want to use their trade tools in TA!

850 2018-04-16 22:11:40 We are in a period where Crypto has reached the world, and there is no turning back. Now it is survival of the fittest as every project fights for their sector. $ETN has the potential to become the main P2P payment platform. It has the potential to kickstart a new world economy.

868 2018-04-16 22:08:35 Why isn't anyone getting Pomp's point? He never said their new crypto currency itself was "good". He's saying it's bad that 3rd world countries are ahead of the US with crypto.
869 2018-04-16 22:08:26 Sounds like they struct a deal to dump their corporate crypto-bags for cash/stock.

878 2018-04-16 22:07:12 Somebody might wanna double check my statement. I know it’s a hidden bullish divergence w RSI, but Cheds was saying low OBV is always bad, and obv isn’t a 0-100 measurement.
879 2018-04-16 22:07:04 I think you’re on to something.

881 2018-04-16 22:06:51 I’m thinking when Revolut opens shop in the US, I may use it buy XRP in smaller amts via their card and send fiat to my family in Turkey  and the mid-west when needed. There is just no simple way, as of yet, to buy and HODL without getting nailed with fees.
882 2018-04-16 22:06:50 Ronnie it's batshit crazy.  The republic is in serious trouble and you have Twitter asshats making fun of you when you speak out.  Unreal.  Please keep speaking truth to power. Thank you.
883 2018-04-16 22:06:48 Well said. And good luck, if it works for you thats all that matters!

886 2018-04-16 22:06:35 As much as I like crypto some of this shit is dumb. Why would we remake the same shitty systems just to call it decentralized lol
887 2018-04-16 22:06:05 Lol. Okay. So you are a price action only trader. That is fine. There are those who only use candles, only use trend systems, and more. I know traders who use Turtle system successfully, trend indicators successfully, and other systems as well. I share the things I am watching
888 2018-04-16 22:05:49 Been crazily accumulating $cpx from my $wan profits
889 2018-04-16 22:05:47 #VRM fits in that low cap of 5 million perfectly :) it’s going to some coin that in the summer  #verium
890 2018-04-16 22:05:37 I wasnt aware it had a function for RSI. only that it was an observable indicator.
891 2018-04-16 22:05:27 is @dether_io just a clone of @AbraGlobal with their former "Abra  Teller" system ? They did abandoned that project because it wasnt safe  enough for people selling $crypto ! How this new project resolve that issue ?
892 2018-04-16 22:05:27 Sorry to be more clear: your light green line on the obv. When you look out for divergences, you’re looking for differences in lows or highs. Ex. Higher lows in price, lower lows in obv, bearish. Or lower highs in price, higher highs in obv, bullish.
893 2018-04-16 22:05:26 Is your faith in crypto the same as it was in December 2017?
894 2018-04-16 22:05:18 "X Cloud is to Google Drive or Dropbox what ProtonMail is to Gmail or Zoho" Great statement by Internxt's CEO Fran Villalba Segarra! @fvsegarra @InternxtHQ @ProtonMail #Bitcoin #Security #Internxt #Cloud #Crypto #ZeroIn2018 #CoinDesk #Consensus2018 #Crypto #Security #Privacy
895 2018-04-16 22:05:16 This is why crypto is so exciting. You have here a 1M$ low cap with such huge ambitions, traded on some fuck exchange called tradeogre and could do a x1000 with it some day if...
896 2018-04-16 22:05:06 Arguing over whitepapers lol
897 2018-04-16 22:05:04 Doesn’t matter. Just go to an exchange where your gem is! Just take fund out from exchanges and put them in personal wallet/Ledger
898 2018-04-16 22:04:46 For cryptocurrency investment saving plans one has to to a lot of research and make sure that he is investing in a coin that has trustworthy team behind it. I personally firmly believe that @DNotesCoin is one of the most trustworthy out there. #dnotes #crypto #kripto #investment

907 2018-04-16 22:03:03 All you guys coming at @justinvendetta for “tagging” arrests and a suspended license are clowns.

931 2018-04-16 22:00:18 I know, and that’s grand, but as I said earlier characterizing crypto as the Wild West plays to the worst perceptions legislators and the public have about the space and what it can do for the world. It seems self-serving since Ripple fits more comfortably with the status quo.
932 2018-04-16 22:00:14 Haha yeah true Funny it was worth exactly the same in $$ value on Feb 5 at 42k sats. It needs to really out run BTC. It can do it though

998 2018-04-16 21:52:20 Is there a reason you would discount a divergence with a 14day time frame?
999 2018-04-16 21:52:10 Actually , might as well start with learning about wallets and how to secure the coins your about to purchase.  :)

1003 2018-04-16 21:51:34 Digital forms ?

1011 2018-04-16 21:50:35 I agree with that- that this would overall be great for crypto generally-now to ppl saying“what if XVG dumps?!” “Omgosh!!!” I expect anything dump even as holder- Bitcoin even dumps- nothing is up forever ya dig- it’s about continuously good moves leading to overall success
1012 2018-04-16 21:50:12 Salut MrT ça serait cool que tu parles des crypto anonymes sous-évaluées dans le marché: comme : BTCP, Deep Oinon, Zoin, je pense qu’elles vont exploser 
1013 2018-04-16 21:50:12 Why is that exciting?
1014 2018-04-16 21:50:11 Will crypto ever be able to pair with fiat not based on btc value?
1015 2018-04-16 21:50:11 I won’t judge. I’d do the same.
1016 2018-04-16 21:50:02 Socio como vas? Tu que sabes bastante que opinas, el mercado ya se desinflo lo que se tenía que desinflar y ahora podemos mirar para arriba? O falta aún por bajar un poco tal vez consolidación?
1017 2018-04-16 21:49:30 Vorig jaar in april gestart met crypto met investering dat ik gedaan heb in crypto nog steeds bijna verdubbeld dus zeker een beter rendemend dan dat de banken geven .
1018 2018-04-16 21:49:12 Disagree.  It's just an attempt to surf the hype to raise money by a failed government.  It's a money grabbing scam that is bound to fail.  Truth is its not embracing anything in reality.
1019 2018-04-16 21:49:08 The TIA (Tennis Industry Association) in the U.S.A., in its last report, estimated the global tennis economy at $5.94 billion in 2015, recording an almost 4% growth

1028 2018-04-16 21:47:47 I have learned from past examples that last day usually is a disappointment. it could pump, but usually it is a let down. and announcements in crypto are usually dangerous. look at previous examples like $MCO or $EMC2 or $ZCL announcements about fork date or even forks like $NXT

1031 2018-04-16 21:47:04 But a crypto currency , that’s running on a blockchain or is a blockchain is a crypto currency regardless of decentralization no ?

1048 2018-04-16 21:45:14 Venezuela is unfortunately a corrupt country with a collapsing monetary system. Them issuing crypto is not an embrace of technology but an attempt to issue debt without the obligation to pay the debtors back.

1053 2018-04-16 21:44:20 This is my take on the lawsuit: it's not a complete non-issue as any lawsuit could cause issues, but if it does become an issue then it's not a NANO-specific issue. This lawsuit could impact the entire crypto ecosystem, not just NANO.
1054 2018-04-16 21:44:13 As far as i know there is no "official" date as of yet, just sometime in late April.

1065 2018-04-16 21:42:31 $ZRX has a lot of room to move, still doesnt look like FOMO officially engaged. It is very undervalued. Offers way more than $EOS .

1105 2018-04-16 21:36:50 2) @aantonop compares controlled crypto projects to the INTRAnet and compares open source projects (like BTC) to the INTERnet.
1106 2018-04-16 21:36:44 Currently you pay negative interest rate in Switzerland. Banks are not concerned about crypto and blockchain, they support it. The transparency of banking is not enacted in many countries, therefore the anonymous bank accts are still popular there.
1107 2018-04-16 21:36:38 Got that right
1108 2018-04-16 21:36:24 I hope everyone into crypto will benefit in future from the $XVG announcement tomorrow. No matter if you hodl or not Verge, if you like it or not. Just hope it's gonna be a positive news for all crypto believers

1117 2018-04-16 21:35:31 There are countries which have directly or indirectly pushed forward cryptocurrency way more than Venezuela.

Creating a cryptocurrency to save them from national debt is not innovation!

The only contribution they made was their terrible economy which pushed people to use crypto

1137 2018-04-16 21:32:57 What's the minimum?
1138 2018-04-16 21:32:50 Narrative I'm hearing more lately: 

1. We don't have enough high quality product teams in the crypto space. 
2. Protocol layer is crowded and investors who focus on consumer layer can find interesting opportunities. 

Question: Who are the best product teams in crypto right now?

1200 2018-04-16 21:21:58 IMO only way gold could be currency whale oil is if CB's go away (unlikely), or if crypto overtakes.  Interestingly, if crypto/blockchain go mainstream, gold may be the best play out there, as there are few mkts more opaque & more levered than gold.

1254 2018-04-16 21:14:16 True. I agree.

I still think the "code is law" argument on ETC has value though. I think King Vitalik has made some "dictatorial" decisions that don't belong in crypto.

I do see it being overtaken by other "smart" crypto platforms though. (Same goes for ETH)

1263 2018-04-16 21:12:19 What about litecoin? What about other coins? Many others used as SOV in crypto format. The demand for SOV is limited. One holding takes the place of another.

Will there be no further successful BTC forks? LTC forks? BCH forks? There will likely be, and many. 

Why/how later.
1264 2018-04-16 21:12:12 It’s not about crypto it’s about BlockChain, it’s ledger system and the encrypted mining machines whose applications will go beyond moving currency around, soon it will be IoT data, procurement and real estate contracts, healthcare data++ open ur eyes to the true innovation

1275 2018-04-16 21:11:02 I think it’s time to go balls deep straight into $GNT!!! Has to be one of the most undervalued crypto going. Love what they do and how they are going about doing it!

1276 2018-04-16 21:11:00 Depends on where you see the mkt cap going or how much you have....no troll good luck
1277 2018-04-16 21:10:50 Before correcting, I didn't have 2step authorization on some of my accounts. Also, I didn't notice email sent to me to grant authorization. Added more security, and notifications. As well, people should remove any crypto from your accounts into off line wallet.
1278 2018-04-16 21:10:47 Yeah looking at volume on exchanges for etc, and considering how few people use crypto in general for anything but trading, I can't see these numbers being realistic. And if they r and it's not purposely being done, I still think there's no value in that number coming from etc
1279 2018-04-16 21:10:43 What crypto emoji represents people who bought ripple at $3.50?
1280 2018-04-16 21:10:36 @xavitowerss
1281 2018-04-16 21:10:34 That's exactly right  I have been focused on shipping working product for myself(I'm the most active user for dApp and al; the tokens and collectibles) and all the users in the community, that's why I initially started working on Trust.
1282 2018-04-16 21:10:25 Again your attention to detail is lacking I put 2,000 + plus sign you want to know what did it was up more but bear markets $XVG had it since June 2017 and sold. Go check charts and you’ll see $XVG was up 4 digits but your a trader I thought you knew this, part of it was luck =

1292 2018-04-16 21:09:38 So with the rocky road, sounds like it’ll be a good idea to trade out some of my position with it then.   Thanks for your crypto info!
1293 2018-04-16 21:09:33 I’m not going to lie I’m intrigued I hope it turns out to be something because obviously if it’s nothing it makes all of crypto kind of look bad.

1365 2018-04-16 21:00:46 Could Forbes' interest in baseless unfounded hype-based journalism push Bitcoin to $25k? Could articles like this further mislead the public on where a reasonable entry point into the crypto market is?

1393 2018-04-16 20:57:33 Have him explain the value of crypto without referring to any BlockChain features or functions which again includes the ledger system & encrypted mining machines! I dare him
1394 2018-04-16 20:57:24 Maaayyybe they even have a crypto... crypt... ol... ogy? Cryptology? Section! You know! Ghosts and bigfeets and alien things. 
1395 2018-04-16 20:57:22 I prefer taking care of my phone and have it on there

1399 2018-04-16 20:56:48 Hi all! My old account is unbanned and I’ll be going back over there for crypto/crypto-related tweets 

Follow me over at @CryptoBirna 

I won’t be tweeting here anymore
1400 2018-04-16 20:56:40 Thats also my name in Italy
1401 2018-04-16 20:56:39 I’m considering it 
1402 2018-04-16 20:56:37 oppinion on $Wagerr ?
1403 2018-04-16 20:56:33 I wish for crypto adoption and success but the * un regulated * mortgage based security market destroyed the American economy in 2008-2009. So regulating something doesn't cause economy to collapse.

1405 2018-04-16 20:56:15 Sorry to tell you this, story came out this weekend.... 140 fake accounts created to create a bigger name... shame that.
1406 2018-04-16 20:56:09 @Joe_Gatchalian Hello, do you know any site(s) or exchange where one can buy Verge with fiat straight? I go load that want to buy verge but don't want to go through exchange of buying other crypto to exchange for verge, just want to buy verge straight with their fiat. thx
1407 2018-04-16 20:56:06 Definitely #eca $eca Nick, huge potential coin! This will be our year(s) in crypto world!
1408 2018-04-16 20:56:02 That's probably a great idea. Thought the same thing this afternoon researching a stock they were talking about. They do it with stocks, with crypto, it has to be intentional.
1409 2018-04-16 20:55:57 Genuinely curious about horse, gonna have to look this one up.
1410 2018-04-16 20:55:50 @VergeLife @VergeBull @vergecurrency I wish you luck tomorrow AM! I hope the price  and you prove the #Fudders and #haters wrong. #gamechanger #branding it’s great for #crypto if you succeed. You have tons of support  #VergePartnership #XVG

1413 2018-04-16 20:55:37 Last point that made me laugh is that these crypto exchanges CHARGE an exchange Fee to convert ur dollars to crypto.. yeah ur saving money and avoiding fees hah ur paying them upfront. Pay me now or pay me later but ur going to pay a fee
1414 2018-04-16 20:55:17 Wanna have fun? Shit on $trx or $xvg and watch as hordes of gullible dipshits try to defend their shitcoins. It is so fucking hilarious. Emotionally attaching yourself to any coin, is just a dumb as shit idea.

1418 2018-04-16 20:55:04 @willbourget jette un coup d'œil sur $MWAT sur Kucoin
1419 2018-04-16 20:54:42 He’s invested so he’ll say anything to get u in. BlockChain, it’s ledger system & encrypted mining machines move anything around in Blocks so all you need to do is move the digital form of any currency & with establish exchange ratios you don’t need crypto, banker or pay any fee.

1421 2018-04-16 20:54:33 Not you again..
1422 2018-04-16 20:54:26 No, we have not posted an article about casinocoin. We have only included it in our altcoin spotlight list so far. Please sign up for our email blast to get our latest updates.
1423 2018-04-16 20:54:20 RSI trend has been good for shorter term bounces but @AltOne_Crypto's fibs are good for a larger retrace. I also drew support at 2500 because it was a major support before the last ATH. I see it going up from here so I'm not that concerned about the exact bottom.
1424 2018-04-16 20:54:14 @boxmining let me ask you a question. If you lose al you money in crypto do you think the gov says hey here you have tax money to compensate? No so why do we pay taxes over money we already payd taxes on. WE TAKE THE RISK. SO WE MAY PROFIT. thats how i think about taxes.
1425 2018-04-16 20:54:13 I pay creators with BAT using the Brave Browser. It's one of the few crypto projects I really believe in.

1430 2018-04-16 20:53:45 Love you John, but we know you got rich off crypto... as long as they (gov) can’t prove it, they can’t steal it
1431 2018-04-16 20:53:34 The only link Between him and Balina is that they are both black and in crypto.
1432 2018-04-16 20:53:27 Sorry haha. Didn’t see it. I’m not going to comment on coins I don’t know much on
1433 2018-04-16 20:53:22 Too lazy for the research at this specific moment and I dont have an opinion on neither of those, sorry
1434 2018-04-16 20:53:15 @realDonaldTrump #tradewar.      Let’s use crypto currency and join one belt one road ..!!!
1435 2018-04-16 20:53:07 Key words, ( traditional sense)... did he pay him with crypto currency?
1436 2018-04-16 20:52:57 All dips are buy opportunities in my opinion.

1442 2018-04-16 20:52:17 I'm particularly happy that @earndotcom got acquired by @coinbase because @balajis used to give me crypto career advice when I was getting into the space years ago. It was a nice thing to do and he simply didn't need to do it. Cheers to the good folks.
1443 2018-04-16 20:52:16 Great lay

1460 2018-04-16 20:49:27 Luke Martin and @DiaryofaMadeMan shouldnt be used in the same sentence. @VentureCoinist is great and not to be confused with Balina. You needed his help to weed out ICO's? Couldn't you make those decisions for yourself? ANd of course you're up 2000%.

1475 2018-04-16 20:47:31 Today the crypto noob sphere looks amazing
1476 2018-04-16 20:47:20 How to actually weed out paper ICO’s with weak teams and no actual working product.  And if you want more firepower I’m up 2,000% + entire portfolio. I also learn from Luke Martin. I don’t think I have enough space on Twitter to keep going on...
1477 2018-04-16 20:47:19 You are right xpr isn't crypto currency i have never even heard of it!
1478 2018-04-16 20:47:09 I believe @Steven_McKie called the @coinbase and the @earndotcom acquisition? Feels like old news...... get with the times people.

1484 2018-04-16 20:46:25 Ouch... :(
1485 2018-04-16 20:46:11 It’s like if anyone in crypto sneezes in a direction or manner that an individual doesn’t like the entire thing is crap-personally-I’m excited about Verge in a trillion $ + crypto market-my thoughts are beyond tomorrow-I like my position unless they start being criminal then 
1486 2018-04-16 20:45:59 Totally agree. IMO, Its still early days as most people I talk to have no idea about crypto in general....
1487 2018-04-16 20:45:46 Cheers guys have you reviewed casinocoin? I know you mentioned here, but wondered if you have done one and can link it to me, I’m obviously invested in it, but would be good to hear views.
1488 2018-04-16 20:45:43 That's an interesting idea Paul, and somewhat #BigBrained. Are you saying that the type of order you use changes the market dynamic between buyers and sellers?

1503 2018-04-16 20:42:33 To be completely honest, I just couldn’t find anything remotely befitting of the level  of research on display in those tweets... that rhymed with ‘Top Hat’

1506 2018-04-16 20:42:06 Hmm nothing he said was false or did I miss something? Teaching people for free? Sharing Portfolio several times a month we’ve never had this much transparency. So the people that made money by learning from him are we supposed to give our gains back? 
1507 2018-04-16 20:42:02 So...

"Crypto-valootie?"
1508 2018-04-16 20:41:39 Unfortunately Revolut is a bank, a modern one with really good services ....but when it is about #crypto, Revolut holds the private keys and doesn't allow P2P transfers of crypto...in this sense is pretty useless, probably scared of AML and associated risks
1509 2018-04-16 20:41:34 Would love to take my 2 high school boys who are  crypto and in a computer science program at their school to further their interest in the space. We are local here in S. Florida. 
1510 2018-04-16 20:41:25 Let’s not forget that any partnership is better than none-whether it lives up to the hype which I don’t like super hype but guys why in crypto must a company walk a tight rope only? Apple admitted to messing up phones purposely yet Apple will continue to be a JUGGERNAUT

1512 2018-04-16 20:41:08 Whether the crypto prices fall 15% or rise 15% from here, it doesn’t really matter. In the medium to long term (3-10 years) this will be seen as the bottom.

1639 2018-04-16 20:23:54 Probably tax related as others say.

Honest answer - he doxed himself. 

Simply trading crypto used to be high risk high reward alone. 

Becoming a public figure is maybe slightly higher reward (paid groups, insider info, dump on followers), but the risk is exponentially larger.

1780 2018-04-16 20:08:04 One last dip or not, the risk/reward for $BTC feels quite asymmetric to the upside from here in the intermediate term.

If you buy the right price, selling with profit gets easier, no matter the coin :)

1833 2018-04-16 20:00:57 In this ridiculous borrow money for no interest and put it into any asset with a chance to appreciate, $crypto is valuable just to hold excess value now and can balloon without making any technological improvements.
1834 2018-04-16 20:00:57 Hi @CryptoBulld0g was your report for PHR accurate and sincere yesterday? Now that I know you get paid for that stuff.. are you selling stuff you don't believe in, are you making sh*t up or can we trust you?

1836 2018-04-16 20:00:38 Not sure, just seems to be why people are pointing at tax evasion. Plus thought of incredibly lax security around majority of a techy person's substantial wealth raises Qs. 

Personally, curious if theft of crypto could even negate prior year gains from a tax perspective anyway.
1837 2018-04-16 20:00:31 There is no discrimination, instant signup, and no verification required. The trading interface is safe, easy, and fun. This will be more easier for crypto users.

1948 2018-04-16 19:44:31 The truth is NOBODY knows what will happen . It may go up and it may go down... no chart tells you that.. .. 
if charts were sufficient, we would all be rich!!...but they are not,...especially in crypto 
We all have opinions and that's it

1950 2018-04-16 19:44:08 Think of it from the PoV of kids growing up with technology and how much they will or will not rely on banks. They will be used to crypto, instant global transfers and apps to manage assets, investments driven by AI, accessible from mobile devices at a fraction of human cost.

1952 2018-04-16 19:43:49 @crypto_oda va le voir 
1953 2018-04-16 19:43:42 Me too
1954 2018-04-16 19:43:41 There's no premature celebration here...$BTC is still above the trend line I drew and stated that it will act as support.  Fully expect that we'll retrace back and test that support line quite a few times here over the next few weeks.  I'd be surpised, however, if it breaks down.
1955 2018-04-16 19:43:41 Neo update?
1956 2018-04-16 19:43:41 Color back in the cheeks of crypto - let's do this, Q2!
1957 2018-04-16 19:43:38 You don’t owe tax on appreciably, only on a taxable event, like selling to USD or exchanging to another crypto. In either case, you would be liable for tax, whether you lost your coins our not.
1958 2018-04-16 19:43:30 Learn humbly from everything god sends your direction. you have a great channel which lends a good hand to building the crypto space, Dan. thanking you for all that you do 
1959 2018-04-16 19:43:26 my feed full of it last few weeks but thas nobody in grand scheme of things i guess...

1961 2018-04-16 19:43:17 @coinbase please look to better serve the Australian crypto community. #Australia is the 14th highest country in terms of #BTC volume and the government is welcoming to #cryptocurrency. Tax time in Aus is right around the corner!

banks/hospitals & other industries can create their own blockchains that all connect back to ICX blockchain

1970 2018-04-16 19:42:31 The latest facebook scandal 
Mark (Facebook CEO) announced he was looking into crypto few months ago 
Verge uses TOR which is a more common and used technology 
@justinvendetta and Mark Had kind of the same start 
Facebook banned crypto ads which explains the fundraise
Good luck
1971 2018-04-16 19:42:31 Про Папу Дока могу напомнить, там США целовались. В СССР у белорусов было ровно такое же союзное гражданство, как и у жителей РСФСР - это равенство, а не покровительство. А про США - это чистой воды холуйство

1977 2018-04-16 19:41:19 If you like it and researched it...buy it and waiting. Sia is a tremendous product with the best dev team in crypto. Its just getting started!!
1978 2018-04-16 19:41:04 been watching the gaps you've been putting up. will be watching this with fiat ready.
1979 2018-04-16 19:40:57 Either way this whole thing is fishy IMO. Ian isn’t dumb & has been around long enough to know not to store millions of dollars worth of crypto in a hot wallet. This is what you call trying to avoid taxation on $5 mil you made in capital gains.

2031 2018-04-16 19:36:42 Some basic tips, if you don't want to be hacked just like Ian Balina.
Don't use any online #crypto related services.
Don't click on untrusted links.
Trust no one.
Don't store your priv keys on the cloud services.
Please comment the other tips.
2032 2018-04-16 19:36:40 @BittrexExchange Nice that you got a nice UI. But scrolling does not seem to work in Chrome with the non native scrollbar. "MY ORDER HISTORY" does not update after buy/sell and is closed by default. Could you look into this? So far the old UI was better.

2036 2018-04-16 19:36:11 I think the crypto market is way easier to manipulate than the stock market and its not even close. I honestly couldn't care less who manipulates it though. I don't care for centralized or decentralized, banks no banks. If I'm wealthy, that's all it comes down to.
2037 2018-04-16 19:36:05 so thats why it's ok to lie on twitter a blockchain conference?
2038 2018-04-16 19:35:55 I did well with it last fall, then bought again in early January. It’s been ranging since, but hoping for a large move with it soon. USD chart is looking even better

2060 2018-04-16 19:33:37 The things you just named are characteristics. These things do not make the crypto market like the stock market. Maybe one day it will be like it. But right now it is nothing like it.

2069 2018-04-16 19:32:15 Yeah I would charge way way more. Scam shit
2070 2018-04-16 19:32:10 correct! props... what's the max timeout? Still consider this save and a good use as cash?
2071 2018-04-16 19:32:06 Remember the financial and commercial Rand? Conceptually similar. The only viable reason for CB crypto is greater control IMO
2072 2018-04-16 19:31:53 Human trafficking is what crypto was originally created for so no surprise
2073 2018-04-16 19:31:35 Bitcoin controls every coin. If BTC drops, BCASH drops even more. BTC will always be the people's choice no matter how bad you think it's doing.
2074 2018-04-16 19:31:32 That picture is sexist :)
2075 2018-04-16 19:31:17 So...should I double down on crypto to be ready for this? 
2076 2018-04-16 19:31:16 BTC holders, who wisely got rid of their BTRASH should sue your ass. Class Action baby ..for causing a drag on their investments through slander and misrepresentation.
2077 2018-04-16 19:31:04 Philakone was a fake hack masterminded by himself as he slowly but surely spirals
2078 2018-04-16 19:30:52 Like all crypto "partnerships" of the past it will spike, users realize 90% was hype, and then bail out leading to pre-hype price or lower.

I'd love to be proved wrong but I won't hold my breath.

2081 2018-04-16 19:30:24 Not over $120mm. "And with this deal, the total value of cash, cryptocurrency, and equity returned to our shareholders is now in excess of the capital invested in the company." Price = $120mm MINUS the amount of crypto returned to shareholders when it was 21e6 the mining co.
2082 2018-04-16 19:30:16 Your right but charts on crypto is way different than stock market due to low market cap and no regulations.

2086 2018-04-16 19:29:46 I told Post Malone’s DJ to go all in on Crypto ...I also told him it won’t be about a billy anymore for our kids; they’ll be rappin’ about the TRILLY club.  blew his mind. Then I said; tell your boss  lol 
#CRYPTOCULTURE — feeling excited
2087 2018-04-16 19:29:38 It was an orchestrated FUD attempt by the project team and a few "whales". They don't have enough to secure a legit exchange so they staged last night's "fight" to send the price crumbling 80%. I have screenshots to prove it so if you dont believe me PM me.

2094 2018-04-16 19:29:11 I know you didn't, but it seems everyone else on $crypto twitter does. Do you think it's the built up animosity caused by decades of expensive overdraft and other 'banking' fees or the corruption over the last decade or so?
2095 2018-04-16 19:29:09 Deal or not. We are a UNITED KINGDOM on this issue. Like any other election or referendum. Not parcelling off areas like Scotland, London, Northern Ireland or Uncle Fred’s farmyard, for the sole purpose of sowing crypto strife and subversive discord.
2096 2018-04-16 19:29:03 You got to let that go. That's over.
2097 2018-04-16 19:29:02 Maybe because we're only telling the truth... the only thing we can ask is that you do your homework... and stop calling BCH a scam because you guys know it is a threat to your 'store of value' coin... for me both BTC and BCH may co-exist... but BCH will win in the end...

2100 2018-04-16 19:28:42 @Socal_crypto thanks for being vocal about you mining ventures. I found $ARO bc of you and was able to sell a hefty chunk yesterday for a great return. Thanks man!
2101 2018-04-16 19:28:35 That they won't have a product until late 2019 apparently.
2102 2018-04-16 19:28:34 LOL this event has nothing to do with BCASH. What a joke. Who cares about bcash? That shit is tanking under $1,000 again. Mr. Roger "wanna be satoshi".
2103 2018-04-16 19:28:29 Man, you really hate this guy. Lol

2138 2018-04-16 19:24:20 FB users don’t care. Spoke to many of then. Online identity they built trumps the advantages for leave, today. Agreed - one of best ads for crypto though. Tomorrow is different story.
2139 2018-04-16 19:24:17 We agree then
2140 2018-04-16 19:24:11 Everyone likes to bash Bitcoin during the bear markets. Bitcoin and its reputation is why money enters the crypto space. Bitcoin decoupling and market dominance will decrease naturally, we shouldn't force it by bashing and destroying blockchains most reputable flagship.

2146 2018-04-16 19:23:22 As well as the digital money sanctioned directly by the state, which has increasingly bad security characteristics (e.g. card fraud), we have corporate versions (paypal and tons of copycats), then bitcoin and crypto-ccys giving breaking up what 'money' even means.

2148 2018-04-16 19:23:12 You start with a few line, the better you get, the more you add line, here and there. Then you start with Ichimoku, fibronacci, spirale fibronacci, your chart start to look like an modern art canvas...

And at the end, when you finally master it... You draw only 2 lines.

2178 2018-04-16 19:19:57 have to agree 100%. supply and demand is key. with more adoption comes more demand, at that point the supply will have been dwindling down and driving the price through the roof. It's always been adoption with crypto. Unless the government forces it as new currency, its all on us

2194 2018-04-16 19:17:59 The only ones benifiting from making #crypto calls on twitter are those who have paid groups. The rest of us just want our ego stroked.
2195 2018-04-16 19:17:52 In crypto, we have a lot of “toy designs” and not many scalable apps.

What’s worse is that most people can’t tell these two categories apart.

2211 2018-04-16 19:15:50 It’s a tried and true technique for companies to fill a space then lobby for regulations keeping others out of that space. It’s very distasteful and not in keeping with the ethos of crypto in my opinion. As I said, I own Ripple but don’t care for this strategy
2212 2018-04-16 19:15:39 Lol was a billion MC a lot back then?

2213 2018-04-16 19:15:28 Why are you specifying that “quantity” ? Are you saying you have received payment for tweets, just not that amount?
2214 2018-04-16 19:15:18 So how’s everyone’s crypto currency portfolio looking? Where my future quadrillionaires at?

The unlimited money supply via forks is overstated. BCH provided competition to BTC (being about 10% of each metric), BTG didn't do nothing.
2240 2018-04-16 19:11:42 Yes. Someone at the University of Nebraska thought naming their pod Around the Corn was a good idea. So we go by the pseudonym "The hottest new show in crypto" as a second choice for iTunes purposes.

2359 2018-04-16 18:59:50 Shouldn't have used word "garbage". Too extreme.

It's a valid concern, rooted in misunderstanding of how and why monetary policy is nowadays conducted by central banks, and the diffetent types of money "printing".

There's BTW unlimited money supply in crypto via forks.

I got great returns already and don’t want to risk it. If some bad news come out this bear run could go longer, just being cautious for my risk-reward.

2399 2018-04-16 18:54:39 Your interviews are all good. Most crypto podcast interviews from others rarely ask the pertinent questions from the investor POV and often go way too easy, ends up just being a shill. Keep it up!
2400 2018-04-16 18:54:34 I don’t get the ire he draws from the crypto community. You tell people do DYOR, he did his and made a killing. Also made other people money along the way. He doesn’t do anything anyone else doesn’t do, yet people hate him bc of his visibility.
2401 2018-04-16 18:54:29 I’m a fan of the hype pump for the tax man theory. It’s gonna dump hard when we find out it’s announcement is as vapour as the tech.

2410 2018-04-16 18:52:39 I read up on Bitcoin for months before my first measley $100 buy in Dec 2016, then I went all in towards the end of Jan 2017.

What actually got me reading about Bitcoin and crypto was learning more about Nootropics, and crypto was the easiest way to pay.
2411 2018-04-16 18:52:38 i can not believe narcissism can evolve as low as this. Desperate? No feeling of shame?   Do us all a favor and just go away. Far away. And never show up again in the crypto world. The way to convince people is by facts and being respectful, even with competitors. Not by fraud.

2422 2018-04-16 18:51:32 @fluffypony, I think it’s unrealistic to presume which remedies any capable law enforcer would enlist to solve a case.  However, it seems highly likely that one might resort to IP traceability if the crypto transaction itself was sent privately. BTCP @bitcoinprivate

2424 2018-04-16 18:51:28 I hope his comment was a joke.. because if he’s serious, he’s part of the reason regulation is being talked about so much and also the type of story people here and get scared of crypto before they ever learn about it, which in turn prevents new money from entering the market

2472 2018-04-16 18:46:14 Crypto community needs to finally understand the concept of buy the rumor sell the news. Anyone buying from now and up to announcement is gambling and will probably lose.
2473 2018-04-16 18:46:09 Maybe that's why you are always relaxed, thanks for sharing wisdom!

2476 2018-04-16 18:45:25 Regulated Crypto Currency ?
Who will regulate ? Goverments ?
Dont they have Fiat to regulate and Govern ?

Do we really want a goverment which says : "You pay me because you made money ?"

Cyptocurrency = Consensus.

So we better self regulate !
No need 3rd Party.
2477 2018-04-16 18:45:12 Crypto Stolen = No taxes........

2481 2018-04-16 18:44:55 Yes by "big" I was referring to "central" banks...nbd

Austrians don't necessarily have a problem with fractional lending (although they have their critiques) they have a problem with unlimited money supply. Doesn't seem like a garbage opinion.

2490 2018-04-16 18:44:03 Funny you say that..Last year on Jan Bitcoin was not even $1000. So even if it bottoms to $1500 it's still 1.5 times up. Why don't you think that it can reach that levels again? It's all about perspective...
2491 2018-04-16 18:44:00 Although not all European banks are ready to enter the crypto market, the situation is changing for the better. The need of regulating cryptocurrency transactions is recognized by both states and international organizations.
2492 2018-04-16 18:43:56 This is so predictable, all of you people use the same arguments with the exact same wording. Straight from BCH troll textbook. Remember this was about a proven lie roger told on twitter. You cannot argue that with no whitepaper.

2520 2018-04-16 18:40:13 My biggest bag right now is exactly 10%. Although a few times I went as high as 20~30% for some short term plays (using tight stops in case it went the wrong way)
2521 2018-04-16 18:39:56 Could also be that 5 is finished there and it just did A ....
2522 2018-04-16 18:39:48 was confused, because you responded to a crypto tweet

2524 2018-04-16 18:39:39 @wavesplatform 
Thanks for creating biggest scam. The way you fooled 3000 group members was really clever.
Maybe this was just another scam in crypto industry but I am personally affected by it so I have to retaliate.

2534 2018-04-16 18:38:44 Is this crypto related?
2535 2018-04-16 18:38:39 That's what i like about your level headedness (if thats even a word). Never miss an opportunity to draw lessons out of any situation. Btw for everyone else out there making fun of the situation, this could happen to anyone of us. Hardwarewallet is key to crypto investing
2536 2018-04-16 18:38:39 this is how newbs get rekt. nobody knows where the price is going. quit spewing this poison.
2537 2018-04-16 18:38:36 And it's not just us. Whoever's doing this is doing it to dozens of crypto-related twitter accounts.
2538 2018-04-16 18:38:33 So, your biggest bag is less than 10% of your portfolio?
2539 2018-04-16 18:38:19 let me guess, bitcoin trash is better. Stop trying to pump bitcoin trash.
2540 2018-04-16 18:38:18 Someone asked me what I did, and wanting to avoid the crypto conversation I went with "we're developing next generation business solutions for problems focused on database and middleman markets" #alternative #Blockchain
2541 2018-04-16 18:38:05 and again: "The zerosum dog-eat-dog competitive world is probably needed in mature fiat world, but it has no place in crypto. We need to join together to create a giant supernetwork that will be a magnet to pull as much fiat into crypto as possible" that is

2554 2018-04-16 18:36:21 This is an amazing project. Fundamentals look very solid. I like that it is built on NEO blockchain!
2555 2018-04-16 18:36:08 I do some bigger bags and short term trades, but yeah for the most part I spread with a low %
2556 2018-04-16 18:35:58 I saw similar posts at the time when I invested in DRGN, do not believe on first read.
2557 2018-04-16 18:35:43 have a look at $DGB
2558 2018-04-16 18:35:25 Just hold on. There are few groups talking negative because they wanna see if you sell your Verge and tomorrow they buy all coins back. This is the way how they bring people down. This kinda people have no heart. They are ice cold. Just click those news away

2565 2018-04-16 18:34:38 Yup. I’m fine with holding lots of bag with each only account to 1% - 2%of my portfolio. I found it less stress and easier to hold for bigger gain. 

Though some might question on why do we spread our portfolio so thin.

2596 2018-04-16 18:31:32 One of the most common beginner misconceptions I see is that a "blockchain solution" is the same thing as an "identity solution". 

It is not. Here's why:

2599 2018-04-16 18:31:21 I'm hearing a lot of skepticism about whether the guy with the livestream "Hacking the System" who claims he got hacked was actually hacked. Always important to keep in mind that in crypto few things are what they seem
2600 2018-04-16 18:31:20 Beautiful, Wanchain honestly keeps amazing me
2601 2018-04-16 18:31:17 Funny how mainstream media are bipolar about crypto. One day it’s a bubble second day it’s moon
2602 2018-04-16 18:31:16 Yeah I research a lot, try to keep myself informed on FA and sometimes take a look at the charts. These are not completely passive investments, but I don't trade them daily and try to look for the bigger picture. In general I only sell or buy on very good setups. Otherwise I wait
2603 2018-04-16 18:31:16 4/ Lagarde on central bank cryptos: "If privately issued crypto-assets remain risky and unstable, there may be demand for central banks to provide digital forms of money."
2604 2018-04-16 18:31:13 Keeping your coins secure is the No. 1.importance in crypto.I've made noob mistakes like not turning on 2FA because they were so small of a shit coin I didn't care about. That shitcoin is worth millions today.Small mistakes (at the time) can easily turn into life changing errors.
2605 2018-04-16 18:30:58 It's a massive global company
2606 2018-04-16 18:30:50 Sad to see @DiaryofaMadeMan get hacked & disappointed so much of crypto community hating on him when he’s down. 

Those saying it was a ploy to avoid paying taxes don’t know how American taxes work. You can’t claim a 2018 loss on 2017 taxes.

2623 2018-04-16 18:28:36 Understood, I'm just pointing out that in *addition* to no evidence of a hack he doesn't seem to be a person who's integrity is held in high regard by the crypto community so maybe publishing a story taking his word at face value might not be best journalistic practice.

2693 2018-04-16 18:19:27 We need something like 2FA alongwith private keys and also some amount of regulations to catch the thieves, else thinking of mass adoption will remain a distant dream for crypto if we can't ensure its safety.

- Account all crypto assets as financial asset/liquidity,with a reserve for unr. gains
- In case of loss of assets, you have never realized those gains, thus there is no profit.

This is ofc on basic level - and with the information available.

2931 2018-04-16 17:54:05 Crypto is treated as property, so when you trade one crypto for another you must recognize the gain or loss due to the value change of the property. You can defer (but not avoid) gains under the like-kind position, but IMO crypto to crypto aren’t like kind property
2932 2018-04-16 17:54:04 It's written in this link. Gains and losses with both BTC and other crypto currencies are subject to CGT. The same applies if you trade one fine art painting for another. Read up on CGT rules.

On telegram they said to list the token in a couple of months after the ICO, but you don't have high hopes for the short term price action, I get it. Supposed to be NEP-5 compatible token before the mainnet launch.

3141 2018-04-16 17:28:37 ...some CBs are discussing having a different interest rate for their crypto fiat, but that makes no sense to me. They'd then introduce an exchange rate between their crypto and digital forms. That would be like having a different exchange rate between physical & digital cash...
3142 2018-04-16 17:28:30 Nauticus Exchange will also offer global payment processing, allowing users and merchants to
send and receive payments — like PayPal and Western Union combined but with much lower fees
and live market rates.

3148 2018-04-16 17:28:13 The key for crypto to become a world currency are valuable services that accept only crypto or give discounts for tokens and drive the demand to buy crypto for fiat money.

3162 2018-04-16 17:26:22 ...although allowing the public to hold crypto fiat with direct access to the central bank's balance sheet would potentially allow CBs to charge negative interest rates which they can't do with physical cash...

3178 2018-04-16 17:24:30 Currently, central banks issuing their currency on a blockchain is effectively creating a 3rd form of their money: the crypto form (in addition to physical and digital which already exist). As such, monetary policy would remain largely the same...

3274 2018-04-16 17:13:41 It would be nice if they offered a few more details in the article. Laundering cryptocurrency isn't a real thing. If its digital signature has been linked to a crime it can never be unlinked; just moved. The sites listed all offer crypto to cash services and vice versa.

3278 2018-04-16 17:13:18 Вот и подходит к концу ICO проекта @OfficialAkaiito. Осталось пару дней. Я думаю у этого проекта большое будущее и совсем скоро данную платформу будут использовать многие держатели криптовалют. #AKAIITO #ICO #ethereum #blockchain #AIC #Cryptocurrency #Token #Tokenization #crypto
3279 2018-04-16 17:13:18 Been working on ways to blend crypto and gaming. I think im getting some headway on it.
3280 2018-04-16 17:13:08 This is just Blockchain, most likely private. Kakao Pay already runs on Blockchain as well.

3288 2018-04-16 17:12:28 When you insult new people you discourage them participating in crypto.  If the ultimate goal is MASS ADOPTION of crypto, your actions are self-defeating & shortsighted.  It'd be best to be patient... educate & encourage them to build informed allies. #cryptotwitter
3289 2018-04-16 17:12:26 Bitcoin is a real crypto with SHA256 algorithm, but the block size is     small. Similarly, the speed is so low with many stuck transaction     everytime. I have found a crypto that better than BITCOIN, if you want    to know. #CRL #CRYPTELO #CRLToken

He doesn't know to secure his own crypto, which is a basic knowledge.

He's a scam.

It's as if I tried to say I'm a Bitcoin developer, just because I've read the Bitcoin whitepaper.

3453 2018-04-16 16:56:49 Interesting question! In my opinion, since crypto is guided more by Austrian economics (at least the real ones), it is natural to be a conservative if one values and loves crypto and believes in its future. I used to be 'liberal', many years ago. Then I started doing my research.
3454 2018-04-16 16:56:32 An excellent thoughtful project! Respect the developers! This topic has no competitors, I think for a long time will not. A company that offers a quality idea, in any case will be successful!

3471 2018-04-16 16:55:05 Definitely the supply model is wrong. We already have the demand shifts in crypto which is generally in the upwards direction but having a fixed supply and halving events makes things worse. To be a true currency you need a stability in price in relation to goods.
3472 2018-04-16 16:55:05 Yes yes. Good to know. I mean without us realising that all of us are already in the crypto currency. Hahahaha

3671 2018-04-16 16:33:20 To be fair, looking at Ver's original tweet with the picture, it renders the perception of a packed event, focused on Ver's initiatives and namely Bitcoin Cash.

In case it was a more general event, the tweet certainly makes many believe it was focused on Ver's initiatives.

3805 2018-04-16 16:17:37 - The 25% of bitcoin factor
- The expected growth of Litecoin far exceeds these prices
- Litecoin leading the adoption revolution in crypto (one of the most important things)
- ...and also just because this is my opinion

3830 2018-04-16 16:15:48 Locally, you have to trade crypto with some indivudual. Otherwise open a bank account abroad and transfer there and then to pakistani bank. Abroad option is liable to taxes of that country. If nothing works for you then just keep it digital wallet.

3936 2018-04-16 16:07:01 central banks can print cash.

not bitcoin.. if they print cash and buy btc, the price can only go up.   yet they cant "increase" the bitcoin supply and control price

3945 2018-04-16 16:06:11 @Lydia_crypto hey lidia, don't worry too much.  Don't make more of it than there is. It is just that simple. Just move to binance or the exchange u like best and just wait. Binance is pretty good. They seem to take security pretty serious. No place is perfectly safe but they try.
3946 2018-04-16 16:06:08 All of us who are bullish on crypto and still care about BTC/$ ratio are hypocrites.

3973 2018-04-16 16:03:24 I'm not sure yet what I dislike the most....
Shillina and his way of working, or the key board heroes who immediately start screaming "tax evasion"
3974 2018-04-16 16:03:20 Because they arrested these completely compliant and law-abiding men rather than escorting them out of the building.
Because at least 6 cops showed up to confront and arrest 2 dudes waiting for a friend so they could order coffee.
Because the video shows everyone angry with cops.
3975 2018-04-16 16:03:19 We just registered and we'll be out in full force for @cryptoinvestsmt We're firm believers that blockchain and crypto are changing investment forever and we can't wait to hear how industry experts in our back yard agree.
3976 2018-04-16 16:03:12 Wait out the swings of crypto and just hold on. Don’t panic with the volatility of crypto, invest in the legitimate coins. Stay away from Shady ICO’s and don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.

3986 2018-04-16 16:02:30 Great advice, but unfortunately this is why mass adoption of crypto is still a long way off.  If you are not tech savvy (and even if you think you are) you are easy prey for scammers and hackers.  The tech in crypto needs to be secure, but also easily usable for the masses.

4067 2018-04-16 15:54:21 I'm going to take a look at $BTCUSD, $BTCCNY, $LTCUSD, and by the way, $BTCUSD is directly correlated with $BTCCNY and its extent can be measured and expressed as a percentage. Divergences between the two can indicate  opportunity. #Bitcoin #crypto #Litecoin is often interesting.
4068 2018-04-16 15:54:12 You are twisting again words. I didnt call you a sockpuppet and I don't see why real faces can't be sockpuppets. As long as you don't think by yourself you can be a sockpuppet, no need to be a bot.
4069 2018-04-16 15:54:10 Don't have one, never claimed to. I wasn't an 11B so kinda hard to qualify for one.........

4074 2018-04-16 15:52:57 they only care about gains/losses as a single line item at end of year. HOWEVER, you still have to track every trade for gains/losses but they only care what the NET amount is at end of year. Yes, losses count against your gains even when/if you don't physically cash out.

He proved to be true something anyone claimed to be false. Congrats to him.
If you want to discredit Roger's words maybe you should prove something he said to be false. You can't? What a pitty. But don't twist words.

4107 2018-04-16 15:49:50 There was no #BCash meetup. There was a "Tokyo Free The Blockchain" event which featured 4 projects (none #BCash related). Nice Try Roger.
4108 2018-04-16 15:49:44 Arrogant is to sell yourself as "crypto advisor" while not following basic security principles.
4109 2018-04-16 15:49:43 Most respected “crypto” enthusiasts aren’t heard from publically. So.. false straw man, I guess?
4110 2018-04-16 15:49:42 This is beyond sad. This is an immature kiddo desperately trying to get attention in every way the wrong way. Not anyone in that room came specifically for Bcash while Roger tries to claim they did. Man, so SAD!!! Go find professional help, Roger, you're beyond lost.

FIFO, LIFO, HIFO and get different amounts. So I can just pick the one that results in the least gains and thus least taxes?

4223 2018-04-16 15:39:38 Let me spill it out for you. Roger postet on twitter WE filled the room with BCH supporters, while he was attending a conference that has neither BCH nor Roger on the agenda, speakerlist or somewhere else. So how can BCH or he have anything to do with the attendees of the meetup

4229 2018-04-16 15:39:10 Thats because the original account was verified and then its been stolen. The scammer has just changed the name and VOILA!!!!
4230 2018-04-16 15:39:03 Follow back and I'll DM you my PayPal address and you can send me all this money as proof. Then I promise I will sign up to your crypto Angelo brother x
4231 2018-04-16 15:39:02 It's a Twitter flaw, these scammers buy verified accounts and change the display name. Twitter keeps the verified tick.

4261 2018-04-16 15:35:10 Only realized gains would be taxed... Since many of those coins didn't realize gains (he hadn't sold) then it's deducted as loss/stolen. Short term gains would be -2mil now. Whatever isn't offset in 2018 can be deducted every year after up to 3k until full amount exhausted.

4317 2018-04-16 15:30:20 Are you sure you're reporting crypto tax accurately? We've seen a ton of mistakes out there... Most common:

- Incorrect coin names
- Missing cost basis
- Events that shouldn't be marked as taxable

Still, they are a big improvement on the institutions we rely on today. Check out Paul Sztorcs bitcoin hivemind project to learn more about the limitations of prediction markets.

Anyways, I think you should address this. Without a response from you, this looks like your worst lie yet.

Patreon, Crypto, twitch much better options.
4378 2018-04-16 15:24:54 If I could change one thing, it would be to never mention $crypto to normies around me. 

Limit your exposure and keep it to yourself and your tight $crypto circle.

4542 2018-04-16 15:06:35 A self regulatory organization for 'crypto' is needed to guide the numerous regulators to a framework that makes sense.  It would also help weeding out the bad actors and fraud.  This would help to legitimize the asset class and give comfort to institutional investors.
4543 2018-04-16 15:06:32 Well.... that is quite simple. If a deflationary crypto comes around that is more secure, decentralized, distributed, accepted by merchants everywhere, liquid, low vol.... ect... probably not gonna happen. #longshot

4664 2018-04-16 14:52:32 Totally agree, at the same time the ability to bake value directly into participatory incentives sets crypto apart in the digital space. While other incentives (praise, knowledge, pleasure) are powerful, value is the nearest proxy for life/death that many have in the modern world

4708 2018-04-16 14:48:36 the fact is that everything is measured in USD. USD is the unit of account. It is more entrenched now as UoA in the crypto world than it was in 2013. Imho the serious challenger to USD as UoA could be ETH, not BTC.
4709 2018-04-16 14:48:27 This weekend I took days off to look back through my trades and analyze what was working and what wasn't...

4728 2018-04-16 14:47:17 Regarding $BTC going down:
Lately $BTC and the #Alts started to develop different patterns and trends.
Be ready for:
- BTC going down to 7300-
- Some alts to continue going up

Keep your tracks separate:
1. Buy cheap BTC with fiat.
2. Don't sell your good alts.

4731 2018-04-16 14:47:15 It's an ever evolving thing but. The simple way to value any crypto would be the size of it's functioning/ growning network base and ease to join use the network.

4733 2018-04-16 14:47:06 Neither the existence of BTC/crypto pairs nor the way traders measure their returns determines the unit of account.

4737 2018-04-16 14:46:49 Def. - with those amounts it would be foolish NOT to hire an expert.
And no expert would advise him to do this.

Chances are really small Ian did this for tax avoidance, would not only risk a fine/a case but also jail.

Also, I did not watch the stream - but that is fishy indeed.

4761 2018-04-16 14:44:14 What's your target for $icx?
4762 2018-04-16 14:43:57 True
4763 2018-04-16 14:43:47 Tend to agree w/ you. It would be incredibly shortsighted when there were effective tax avoidance tools in place thru 12/31/17. That said, money causes people to do crazy things. My main skepticism is my personal resolve to stay that cool in the wake of a $2M loss on livestream

4888 2018-04-16 14:33:09 How extraordinary it was the point at which you put a large portion of a year back in #ICO, and today took the benefit 10 times more! You have an opportunity to rehash it, contribute today and gain a great deal of cash! @KoniosOfficial #airdrop #Konios #KON #ICO #Crypto
4889 2018-04-16 14:32:55 私もその可能性を考えてて、MUFGコインの流動性によって発行の可否が変わってくるようにも思います。やはりMUFGコインがそもそも何なのかがいまいち掴めないので情報待ちの段階ですね

Of healthiest potteries where the shaving has tired--

A poem should be complementary
As the rationality of communes.

4921 2018-04-16 14:30:09 It's really good you guys at @therealspotcoin started to address the gender diversity in the crypto industry. Because I think we want more and more people (most boys are already in); girls to be aware of the crypto industry since we all are benefitting from it.
4922 2018-04-16 14:30:07 So.....currently? You do know BTC fees are back in the pennies range right?
4923 2018-04-16 14:30:06 数値としてはっきり出ない部分はありますからね。ただ解析もないところからこのラインから打てば大体2k円超えるかなみたいな感覚と少し似てる部分はある気がします
4924 2018-04-16 14:29:54 I am a proud Indian.
But it's a fact..some of us lack awareness about crypto and they believe since trx is the cheapest Coin..they just buy it.
4925 2018-04-16 14:29:54 買ったとはいえ、もちろんビットコインのドミナンスから大きく乖離する売買はしません。おこがましいとは思わんかね…

うーん疑問なのは価格変動する商品を銀行が独自に発行できたとしたらその分だけ法定通貨に影響を与えると思うんですよね。それをルールが無いとという理由でOKとして良いかどうか。
5002 2018-04-16 14:22:48 Cryptotaxpro. May want to keep it in beta for now. I’ll have to get some disclosure statements about how nothing is official tax advice, consult your own tax pro, etc. before adding anything engaging. I’m too good to wear orange everyday. Would clash with my style.

子供のころは普通に結婚して普通に家庭を持ってると思ってましたが、自分よりも立ち回りがいいやつが伴侶とうまくいかずに離婚しまくってて「あいつらでもダメなんじゃ俺には無理かな」って思って今に至ります。独身でも昔より風当たり強くないのが救いですね。

5071 2018-04-16 14:16:07 However one of the biggest concerns Todd, I do not believe many understand the implications within taxation. At this time there have been very few filings to report gains on the sale of said crypto. Specialised audit software detects transaction, hence enormous audits are coming.

ただ、法律で決まっていないから大丈夫かと言われると疑問が残ります。まして銀行ですから、その辺は慎重になるんじゃないかと思っています。

5102 2018-04-16 14:12:14 "Crypto" means "obscure", and "data" is a plural noun.  (Aren't it?)
5103 2018-04-16 14:12:05 Yeah I know I completely understand the sentiment and agree in most cases, and by no means am I  supporting the OP. I just think it’s wise to understand all angles before accusing - even when it’s near impossible in this current crypto environment

5109 2018-04-16 14:11:35 現行法が追いついていない感じがしますね。

「仮想通貨の発行自体」は現状　国内で法的な規制はまだないのでは？
＝誰でも出来る、銀行も発行できる。

つい最近、ICO関連の規制法が成立したのかな。。忘れた。

If a crypto token derives its value from an external, tradable asset, it is classified as a security token and becomes subject to federal securities regulations.

You know, in relative internet terms on a "per user" basis, we're in about 1997 territory. 

The rise will be much quicker though as crypto is being propagated of the shoulders of the internet.

5259 2018-04-16 13:54:47 MUFGコインを銀行が発行する段階で、ICOを銀行が行っていることになるように思うのですが、よくよく考えると仮想通貨を保有する以上にハードルがある話のような気がします。これが認められるのであればXRP保有も認められそうですねしかし現行法で本当に発行できるんだろうかと不思議に思います。

また逃げるぅ？？www
5283 2018-04-16 13:52:19 J'irais en peu en ton sens, dans la mesure où il y a beaucoup de coin qui ont déjà eu de multiples pump. Il y a beaucoup de high risk qui ont déjà eu beaucoup de mouvement / qui ont déjà fait beaucoup de gains (TRX, ADA, EOS...) donc ROI réduit.
5284 2018-04-16 13:52:05 It’s become popular to split crypto into SoV coins or utility coins. 

This is a false dichotomy.

The truth is, any coin competing for high security is competing for high SoV. 

Thus, many so called utility coins are also SoV. 

Sorry BTC, they’re all gunning for you.

5293 2018-04-16 13:50:38 A platform for insurance of the market of crypto-currencies, which is currently under development. Also, the platform began selling its own coins. It is necessary not to miss this moment to buy them very cheaply. Bitrust @BTF_PROJECT
5294 2018-04-16 13:50:33 Completely agree.

Was in reference to @DiaryofaMadeMan. He took a lot of heat for referencing his previous job as a "wage slave" when he was making six figures.

Now he's apparently been hacked and lost all his crypto. Can't imagine those folks are going to be nice about it.
5295 2018-04-16 13:50:19 I read my bible and your tweets every morning. thanks for all the exciting updates in the crypto world. you’re the best at what you do! Cheers
5296 2018-04-16 13:50:14 In a nutshell, yes.

5299 2018-04-16 13:50:08 “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.” -Satoshi Nakamoto
5300 2018-04-16 13:50:04 Since a possible economic change on cryptocurrencies is subject to a  adaptation, the broad mass during the transition must be introduced to the crypto community in a sensitive, simple and secure way.

5323 2018-04-16 13:47:43 so when it liquidates shorts, BTC price will rise?

5330 2018-04-16 13:46:28 There are MANY other uses for cryptocurrency besides complete replacement of "money" - such as use as an middle currency for settlement, a payment mechanism, a micro-transaction accounting tool, or loyalty system among many others.  Keep studying! WAY more to learn about crypto!
5331 2018-04-16 13:46:15 I invest all I can into crypto (which is a piss poor in perspective.) But I still keep everything on a hardware wallet. Why wouldn't you keep your savings as secure as possible? Learning to manage your funds securely is one of the best time investments you can make.

5363 2018-04-16 13:42:13 They wouldn’t. However, a fully-functioning alternative crypto financial system needs a system for making loans. In the absence of stablecoins, I want to understand how to write a loan agreement that avoids the risk of BTC price appreciation.

5452 2018-04-16 13:32:29 日本の銀行が仮想通貨を保有するのは現状難しいでしょうね。しかし保有しなくても使うということは送金業務を第三者機関に依頼することで解決すると思います。xRapidとXRP自体は送金業者が保有。銀行は窓口として価格形成の機能を果たすものと思っています。

5592 2018-04-16 13:18:48 Yes. But how’s this conductive of mass adoption? I’ve become hyper paranoid since stepping into crypto. If hacks continue & there’s no recourse, I just can’t see it really getting to the point where people say “fk the banks & their reimbursement, I’m gonna be my own bank” 
5593 2018-04-16 13:18:35 そう、ところが、実際には 銀行が XRPを自ら保有する可能性はかなり小さいような気がするのですよ。となるとXRPを保有する第三者機関と個別契約して利用するか、取引所でその都度、買うか、　場外取引で調達するか　ということになりそうですが、場外取引の場合、価格形成、流動性などが無関係だし、
5594 2018-04-16 13:18:25 Jesus' blood is bottomless so it's actually probably a neat metaphor.

5854 2018-04-16 12:52:29 Claiming a theft to avoid taxes is beyond stupid. You still have to report crypto gains, but now you’d also report a theft to often some gains. And you guarantee an audit. And you have to prove theft (no benefit of the doubt). He’d be nailed for fraud

5870 2018-04-16 12:50:55 Bitcoin trades above US$8K & I'm starting to see all of those emotional tweets on crypto currencies again.

6020 2018-04-16 12:34:12 「投資は自己責任では？」
その通りだが、その言葉を盾に汚い手で金儲けを企む人間が個人的に嫌いだ、と既に答えてあります。

これが主観の補足です。

わかりまちたか？
6021 2018-04-16 12:34:02 The "nation state" is responsible for around 3 - 5% of the money supply. The rest is created by private banks through loans. Crypto currencies are a drop in that ocean
6022 2018-04-16 12:33:49 @sancojofficial 
The word "SANCOJ" is an Esperanto word which means "OPPORTUNITIES" in English. It is that simple. Sancoj means opportunities. The Sancoj project intends to offer Opportunities to everyone for free (at zero transaction cost).

6035 2018-04-16 12:32:45 The irony of #crypto is that it actually got me interested in finance / money / investing. The very traditional financial structures that will either survive and thrive with adoption or be left behind. I.E. that one time Borders and Barnes & Noble thought Amazon was ridiculous.

6048 2018-04-16 12:30:58 I remember first reading the Bitcoin whitepaper and thinking:

1. This is easy to understand
2. I know what it's mean to do
3. I know how it works
4. I know the problem it solves

I can barely say this about any whitepapers I read nowadays.

6179 2018-04-16 12:17:17 Something to consider is that advent of crypto currency has made people consider owner control of computers again for the first time in decades.  This in turn reduces e-waste as people no longer need to throw out their perfectly functional old computer to get a software update.

6206 2018-04-16 12:14:51 Still doesn’t explain how it affects the alt coins. Bnb trading pairs are affected as they cannot keep up with the increase in value of Bnb thus making the alt coins graph trending downwards.

6387 2018-04-16 11:57:29 Yes. And bearer crypto private keys are ok, but principal vs agent and legal vs equitable ownership divides are somehow too complicated to understand.

Until then send someone who is new to crypto 1000 cash, I think that's also one mBCH, might make them wealthy at a >10k price.

Never, i repeat, NEVER store your private keys online. I doesnt matter if theyre "encrypted" or not. Just DONT do it. 

Get a hardware wallet (only order on original website!) and always create a new seed before using it!

1. DO NOT store private keys on your computer.
2. Sign out of hot wallets after each use
3. Use a VPN.
4. Not trading funds? Cold storage. 
5. MFA available? Use it.

6668 2018-04-16 11:20:26 They're kind of... in a bad mindset here. Opening banking services but still not that interested in crypto? It's like getting into horses when they're starting to produce cars. Unless they'll make a mishap of all things in one package, in which case it might work.

6686 2018-04-16 11:18:33 No. There's a reason Central banks/Keynes like low inflation cause it chugs the economy along. Deflation and hyperinflation are self-reinforcing problems, which require intervention. Not 100% sold, but one cant be sure. Crypto might be pretty bad. What I do know is it's coming

6838 2018-04-16 10:57:30 It appears someone running the verified APC account sold it to a crypto trader who has now changed it to your name. It was previously called Electra Coin or similar. The whole thing is a farce and Twitter should fix asap.

6857 2018-04-16 10:55:01 Furthermore it's more centralised in the sense that it has a single leader whose actions etc can influence the price. If he turned round tomorrow and said "hey I'm leaving ETH, screw it" the price would drop.
6858 2018-04-16 10:54:59 Things I learned since doing the crypto conference circuit:  9 out of 10 times paying for a ticket is redundant, that having crypto friends means you NEVER pay for food, that dot com parties have nothing on us, and that there is always something new to learn in crypto.

6869 2018-04-16 10:53:19 I'm long ETH too, but I don't see it as a replacement for BTC. For one it's currently inflationary, it's also a much newer and more risky tech and any flaws found in the smart contract security could devalue it.

6890 2018-04-16 10:49:45 There's also a certain danger in the gold value because of jewelry: people wear gold because it's valuable, and this demand gives gold more value. This feedback loop is a recipe for a bubble and could be disastrous for gold if it ever broke.
6891 2018-04-16 10:49:38 And yet it would still have some inherent value. Bitcoin has none.

6905 2018-04-16 10:48:01 Gold has history and industrial use on its side; BTC has scarcity, easy of storing and transactibility going for it. Both have value and both could be bubbles. We could find out tomorrow that China has way more gold than they claimed to have.

6930 2018-04-16 10:43:16 That's just the definition from accounting. If you read a bit of history and anthropology you'll see the term being used to refer the conduct of trade and early IOU systems between tribes. Gold became a global ledger because it was easily verifiable and seemed scarce.

6945 2018-04-16 10:40:50 Gold has inherent value. Btc does not. Gold is a better store of value than btc. Please prove one of these things wrong.

Ethereum can do everything bitcoin can do, and has inherent value. Please prove this wrong.
6946 2018-04-16 10:40:46 @TheDude17144495  Can you please tell me how you take profits?
How do you remove funds from a crypto exchange, Binance for me, and transfer it back to USD and into a bank account?  Seems Coinbase would be to costly to do it regularly.

6959 2018-04-16 10:39:37 Crypto generation is most "tech ignorant" I have ever seen but pretend to be "tech savvy". Dancing your fingers on a keyboard doesn't make you "tech savvy". Most cryptos hated sciences (physics, chemistry, biology) and maths in school and run away from them as fast as they could.
6960 2018-04-16 10:39:21 Admit that you're wrong rather than trying to redirect the thread. And what gives BTC value is the security/immutability of the ledger due to the hashrate. A new coin would require mass-adoption by miners, which is the hard part to get.
6961 2018-04-16 10:39:20 That is not the definition of ledger 
6962 2018-04-16 10:39:08 細かい額のビットコインを大量に受け取っていると（例えば，1時間ごとに自動受信する形のハイプで）「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」のために，送金手数料があとで多額になる可能性があるような気がします。

6983 2018-04-16 10:35:01 A ledger is just a way to account for who owns or owes what. Currencies are government issued ledgers, because they store value and allow us to assign that value to a person (by holding that currency). Gold can, and is, used similarly.

7027 2018-04-16 10:28:02 It's difficult to argue for/against here, since BTC is so new. Gold doesn't really have scarcity as more (an unknown amount) is mined each year. Furthermore it's possible to make gold using fusion (although expensive) and it costs to defend gold against theft.

7041 2018-04-16 10:25:42 BITRUST does not ask you for any personal data because they believe that your opportunity to manage your own assets and trade should not be affected by who you are. @BTF_PROJECT #BITRUST #ICO #TokenSale #ethereum
7042 2018-04-16 10:25:24 I don’t know all too much about crypto. But the purpose of the firm was to make it easier to purchase luxury goods in foreign countries while legally circumventing financial regulation. So there is at least some liberal, reactionary interest in it uwu (the ico failed luckily)
7043 2018-04-16 10:25:18 Ok, now keep going!
7044 2018-04-16 10:25:18 This company is supported by more people. More common to see published in other blogs. A very interesting project P2P. So join us today.

7564 2018-04-16 09:03:30 $tzc is a low cap at 2.3M
$snm is a mid cap at 57M
I'd say that under 10 or 5 it's a low cap, under 100M a mid cap. The lower the better imho, more upside potential if the idea/project seems good.

Dear all, 

It has been a challenging time for all Indians after RBI issues an official circular to all banks on withdrawing support to crypto exchanges.

To challenge the same, CoinRecoil (Kali Digital Eco-Systems Pvt. Ltd.) had filed a writ petition.

7921 2018-04-16 08:00:30 確か2017年5月に仮想通貨の一つであるRipple（リップル）の相場が爆上げして5円→25円ぐらいに跳ね上がったんだよな〜。5倍か〜 。

2018年の5月はどんな爆上げを見せてくれるのかな？ホルダー達が驚き、踊り出すぐらいの価格上昇を期待したい。

8376 2018-04-16 06:44:30 Someday soon. The real breakout will happen organically. Big news brings in whales to pump it up to unsuspecting investors. Mainnet launch will unfortunately trap people.

8439 2018-04-16 06:34:05 I would not  recommend keeping your coins on any exchange.  If you don't hold private keys you don't hold the coins. Get a hardware wallet  or make a paper wallet.

8527 2018-04-16 06:16:22 I have always disliked the projects that integrate with Visa/Mastercard. Mainstream adoption comes from people actually taking cryptos.

8557 2018-04-16 06:09:22 without a doubt this "fork mania" is going to continue to dilute the value of bitcoin. you can print unlimited bitcoins by forking the chain. the whole concept of only 21million is asinine. anyone can now fork the chain and create more "bitcoins"

8562 2018-04-16 06:07:30 nepáči sa mi to. Vyskočil som ráno do fiatu pre istotu. Za posledných 5 dní som spravil malý zisk okolo 260 EUR a takmer dohnal "crypto stratu" čo som si ťahal ešte od decembra :) Síce budem asi nadávať keď to dnes prudko vyskočí hore ale istota je istota.

8592 2018-04-16 06:02:04 That is as step by step as it gets. You have one step. Move your tokens to an exchange. As the article says, this is required on your part. Then after migration you will have same number of coins and you can move them to a new wallet or keep on exchange.

HN isn't happy unless you're writing Rust or Go in some niche company that does crypto for white dudebros.

8633 2018-04-16 05:54:48 Think those "stung" by big tax bills will reenter in a more controlled way. New money may have been waiting for new tax year but overall the market effect comes from the big 4 exchanges & their pattern(call it cycle)which needs to complete
8634 2018-04-16 05:54:28 But I would still be okay with a retracement to 0.5, and maybe it won't happen quite on wave A, but possibly on wave C.

8688 2018-04-16 05:41:04 予想をするのは、シナリオを描いて行動を準備するためにはいいこと。

なんだけど、予想に感情を混ぜて、固執になっちゃうと、外れた時悲惨になりやすい。

だから予想というのは強弁しないのが大事。なぜなら、LやSのロスカット以前に、予想を挫かれた時の精神的退場が危険度大だから。

8762 2018-04-16 05:27:29 I exspect crypto to hit 1 trillion market eoy and trx profiting from that with a x 7 or x 10 ratio. Between 0.50 cents - 0.75 seems achievable to me.

But with trx having it's own mainnet it could also be a x 20 this year as we may enter a bullish market cycle for 3/4 months.

OR

B: The unaware masses are fucked.

I am still not sure.
8820 2018-04-16 05:14:43 You can't compare charts of years past since crypto itself has grown exponentially since then..different ballgame now than it was then

8827 2018-04-16 05:13:26 The little double top on the hourly seems like a nice opportunity to buy in or add before it continues upwards.
8828 2018-04-16 05:13:13 Yeah, Math.random() is not best, but the crypto.getRandomValues() might be costly? Interesting to compare.

Otherwise, the shuffle is also interesting, but maybe not everytime. Sometimes is fine when together; just not as frequently. Perhaps another random check before shuffling?
8829 2018-04-16 05:13:01 Enough to get the warm fuzzy feeling that comes with earning the respect of your peers. Not enough to come close to replacing earnings from trading.

8851 2018-04-16 05:08:50 Haven't taken a look in #Crypto in a while to see that #xvg #verge are still being discussed and defended. Did December not teach you anything?   Imagine being on a sinking ship with water up to your neck defending the notion that the ship is not actually sinking.
8852 2018-04-16 05:08:35 Do you know if those password‐protected PDF archives containing regular files meet the “solid crypto” and “readable with built‐in software” criteria? I’m guessing “writable with built‐in software” is already a lost cause.
8853 2018-04-16 05:08:34 @BigCheds weird chart man, ripple is not going to pull back to this level  unless btc is going to 3-4k then maybe. This chart will kill people their investment . You can do better my man.

8922 2018-04-16 04:52:45 What sort of leverage do you think these trades were on? (is it 50-100x seeing as price isn't too far from the quoted?)
8923 2018-04-16 04:52:33 OK!! So govt is unable to shut down  Alcohol and tobacco companies but effectively Attacked on #cryptocurrency india. That means they care for our money not to lose in crypto but they dont care our lives.

All I am saying that the developers are leaving a big loop hole....

As a design it should not be there.
It can be a simple button or link where a user chose to update.  

In Crypto world there are no laws and devs are working from all over the world often part timers 1/2

9000 2018-04-16 04:37:22 The ratio of good/bad ideas in crypto might not be all that different relative to the larger tech industry. What’s uniquely different about crypto is the ability to scam money from a large number of people. In traditional tech, the damage is kept local to the VCs.

9002 2018-04-16 04:36:08 It's sad that every conversation about "crypto" you overhear in public is so douchey in tone (there's no other word to describe it, or I would use it.) Because the true potential of bitcoin is one of the most beautiful, pure concepts in existence: sound money, true freedom

9055 2018-04-16 04:23:44 The way that crypto price movres makes me think it's just the plaything of some huge investors. I see the massive walls appear on the order book and then the price will drop or rise 3000 pips in a minute or rise. Then the walls will block price movement for hours. 2.5 hours even.

9061 2018-04-16 04:23:02 A good crypto investment strategy is to only invest in coins with founders that have strong relationships with Coinbase execs.

That's part of the reason ETH thrived and ETC died.

9456 2018-04-16 03:10:28 The misinformation about people not paying crypto taxes is surfacing again from publications I used to respect (Gizmodo link in comments). Only 100 people paying, that's absurd. @laurashin  please tell the real story as I've heard CPAs confirm in your podcast covering crypto tax.

9604 2018-04-16 02:43:33 But the fact is Abra app is focusing on the regular Joe. Most people have no idea what an exchange does or is for that matter. Ive had multiple people who are not tech savvy ask how to invest in crypto. My only answer is @AbraGlobal .

9612 2018-04-16 02:41:38 Bahaha.. My point is, lack of mention of increasing the block size cap means nothing with the absence of a mention of a block size cap.

9653 2018-04-16 02:33:59 Coke or Pepsi. Christianity or Judaism. Ethereum or EOS. With humans, best technology is trivial and economic incentives rarely achieve their goals. Tribalism and irrationality rule all and it goes double in crypto. Whomever controls the narrative controls the people.
9654 2018-04-16 02:33:50 Of which part? The dip or the article? McAfee can be a little dramatic in crypto sometimes. I think that’s mostly because he sees the value. And USD going to zero I find very unlikely to many other forces will come into play.
9655 2018-04-16 02:33:42 When you vote you agree with the decision of the MAJORITY, not with YOUR candidate. Then when that winners drops a bomb in innocent people, you DID agree with that! This is democracy. I prefer not get ethically involved with this. Let me just buy some crypto.

9877 2018-04-16 01:54:32 So BTC with another decent leg down mid term, and alt season approaching, do you suspect altseason to occur before the mid term btc leg down, this would no doubt impact the impending altseason? I suspect alts will have less of a significant downturn if btc does drop, comparably.

Let’s hope the partnership announcement is real. There’s been a lot of exit scams in crypto over the years so can’t blame people for being sceptical...

9920 2018-04-16 01:45:18 it got hit hard in this last bear period. pressure to sell from ICOs plus large crypto projects still hodling most funds in $eth led to this i guess. but i think it can recover fast: it is still a leading platform without doubt.

自分はエムだぞ！とアピールしていたのである。
しかしこれには裏があり性的嗜好のエムではなく
尊師、即ちMちゃんである。と言っているのだ。
自分はMである、と隠語を通じて語っているのだ。

通常では西野カナの部分を｢痛い｣や「ゾッとする」と脳内変換したいところだがそれは早計だろう。
ここはなぜ西野カナを負の象徴として提示してきたかを分析する必要がある。
まずは西野カナの代表曲をピックアップしてみたい。

10004 2018-04-16 01:30:30 Congrats @denmo83 you should hold it for a few years!
10005 2018-04-16 01:30:26 So I helped push you in?  That’s pleasing to me.  Hopefully you in the balck in them.  Exchanges are  “lay ups” at times.  IMHO. Crypto not going away. And there is revenues there. UNLIKE most. Always DYOR, I’m not a financial adviser, just some jerk from NY/CT lol.

10008 2018-04-16 01:29:53 I think you have to stop tweeting about crypto and become a liberal.  Pretty sure the same thing happens to me.  Your comments aren’t even showing up in my notifications.
10009 2018-04-16 01:29:51 Thanks, Preston. I appreciate that. I read yours and retweeted as well, and I see you are getting the attention of some CEO's, so bravo to you! No small feat. I feel like we've started down this crypto road around the same time, and I truly pray you surpass and exceed your goals.
10010 2018-04-16 01:29:47 its like asking for a band aid. I talked to a restaurant owner the other day about accepting litecoin/crypto and he said he never heard of it. Then i said have you ever heard of bitcoin and he said yes. unfortunately thats what everyone will tie crypto to for now
10011 2018-04-16 01:29:42 Congrats man, I'm around 65% there
