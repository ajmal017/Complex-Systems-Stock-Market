47 2018-05-01 23:55:58 crypto currency is a lil fragile right now and i’m anxious to sell but i think i should wait.

49 2018-05-01 23:55:48 Feeling pretty good about my LTC bag after only getting into this crypto scene in January. I didn’t buy at ATH but pretty close to it. I’ve averaged down and am finally even/green. The future looks bright. Trying to put a ring on my GF’s finger

67 2018-05-01 23:53:39 50 btc/day on total exchange volume? It is already doing around 300 btc/day. Wouldn't be surprised to see half a billion dollars of volume a day. In which case 10k $bco staked for 12 months would produce around $15,000/mo in passive income combining staking and MM payouts :)

84 2018-05-01 23:51:31 My personal theory for how this all ends is OFAC/Treasury/State get enough evidence to show economic sanctions are being skirted with Crypto and we get an outright ban.

It seems extreme in the current environment, but that’s what I see happening.

140 2018-05-01 23:42:33 No. It's not basic shit to be excited about a potential investment opportunity and get burned. This is why we must self regulate. Take 2 seconds from your quality shitposts and be a leader with your recognition. Crypto is what the leaders make it.
141 2018-05-01 23:42:11 so this would mean you should either change most of your current investments to put your money where your mouth is, or stop making up claims with false statements that basically just show your limited capability of applying logics when it comes to crypto

151 2018-05-01 23:40:48 If you don’t have a $1,000 a month in the account the bank starts charging you a fee. That in itself is nuts as my checking bank is free, but I’ve seen minimum of $250 needed. Thats exactly why Crypto exists. Why charge me for my money. Security? Crypto has it. With no month fee

191 2018-05-01 23:34:16 could you review $IPBC ? Thx :]
192 2018-05-01 23:33:54 Thanks Bird....the bottom line is that $4K is a 80% retrace from the all-time high and would be VERY healthy for the Long-Term. No one whats to go that low, but BTC may very well do what the f#ck it wants - as it usually does. Then we can move (moon) on. Love your work, BTW. THX

215 2018-05-01 23:30:19 That's how I got started in crypto. Half the rent was paid in Bitcoin. It was over 1 Bitcoin a month
216 2018-05-01 23:29:59 (1)The sharing economy is huge. $OCN helps this growth. (2)Too many coins have no core purpose or discernible direction. $OCN does. (3)A live, working successfully integrated product is still rare in $Crypto. $OCN has already done this. I can go on but that's a start haha
217 2018-05-01 23:29:58 Yes its commonly referred to as the "Keto flu". It's natural after attempting to switch your bodies preferred energy source from glucose to fat. Supplementing with  potassium/magnesium will help a lot during the first week or two!

235 2018-05-01 23:26:11 My hot picks for 2018 are in no particular order: $LTC (obviously), $DGB, $LUX & $VTC. Super excited for all 4 projects, $DGB especially but also the ginormous weekly C&H on $VTC must not be overlooked. It is yet to pump, you will not see it this cheap for too much longer.

238 2018-05-01 23:25:37 It's sad how banks under regulations are controlling our money by saying you cant buy crypto with your hard earned money. Yet regulation gives them the legal right to racketeer from pooling our earned money together.

284 2018-05-01 23:17:31 Is crypto job list using the blockchain or just supporting adoption?
285 2018-05-01 23:17:29 I’m in a few crypto groups - will share you around. 
286 2018-05-01 23:17:23 Why risk swimming in the river when you can a boat. Diversify. The Crypto-world has become too sensitive to negative PR (fake news and FUD). See what happened with XVG, TRON. Just a piece of advice, cheers mate!
287 2018-05-01 23:17:09 #6 Another one for me would be Finance sector, we are all so scared of our money being not our money(daily withdrawal limits) and banks charging us money for keeping our money. I would like to see a decentralized bank not just a card but full working bank

324 2018-05-01 23:11:10 Not at this moment since it isn't backed by fiat. But it does fall within that range of services that exchanges offer. Wouldn't surprise me if BNB is connected to future tokens binance releases/fiat backed crypto.

332 2018-05-01 23:09:17 I'm always amused by my occasional glimpses into #crypto Twitter. "Dear ~crypto master~, your buy on *some bullshit coin thing* was amazing but why are you hyping *other thing* so hard!?"
333 2018-05-01 23:08:33 A good move rebranding! Much better than Raiblocks.

Most people (not you) who tell me about it are new to crypto which is interesting.

I’d love to see more info published about potential downsides. I’ve seen none which could be good or could be bad. Lots of neat promises though
334 2018-05-01 23:08:31 What new crypto has anyone heard about with good trading potential
335 2018-05-01 23:08:22 Crypto gat have it a bad reputation that it don't deserve. Great project. They are always work hard to achieve their goals
336 2018-05-01 23:08:20 Doubtful. There is not currently any way to stabilize crypto currencies, which make them difficult to use in daily transactions as  people hold their “coin” in anticipation of near-future gains.
337 2018-05-01 23:08:18 This is the project of the future. Excellent service with convenient interface and extensive functionality, which has great prospects. I advise everyone to become a part of it! @CaratzTeam #CARATZ #bitcoin #ethereum #crypto #cryptocurrency
338 2018-05-01 23:08:11 Thank you. Exactly. If we don’t start calling out the bad actors and opening up some cans of distributed whoop-ass (a.k.a. self-regulation) in the crypto space we may as well just invite the government regulators to do it for us.
339 2018-05-01 23:08:09 If #Bacoin was an actual crypto I'd invest, for sure. Lol. More useful than dogecoin that's for sure. Then again the the crypto markets, bacon will soon be worth more than gold

342 2018-05-01 23:07:09 I think the Hyperledger is more with the funding and payments aspect, but I could be wrong.  That would include Stellar.  Regardless, Ripple is doing things right and keeps giving us glimpses of the possible future.  Amazing!
343 2018-05-01 23:07:09 The rant was because these situations are a microcosm of what's wrong with crypto.  Too many people letting FOMO dictate their behavior.  These could both be great projects, don't get me wrong.  I'm just saying people buying them at those values was silly and needed a rant.
344 2018-05-01 23:07:04 lol

347 2018-05-01 23:06:41 No common sense in crypto space so it might go x2
348 2018-05-01 23:06:33 As long as "centralized exchanges" continue to provide better price, they will rule the roost. Fiat transactions in decentralized exchanges are mostly driven by countries which have ruled against crypto. They will pick up gradually when crypto becomes more pervasive.

352 2018-05-01 23:06:14 Perhaps it’s lineal in a cyclical sense? History repeating itself. The start of the stock market saw people standing on the street trading IOUs.

371 2018-05-01 23:04:07 I think mass adoption will happen from a company that can execute without a native token like $POLY in the middle of the ecosystem, but that's my educated guess. I could be totally wrong. They have a very strong team and great advisors, plus lots of cash in bank
372 2018-05-01 23:03:37 I picked up some more $LUX today. Most people still don't know how strong the fundamentals are for @LUX_COIN. I'll have a write up for you as soon as I can get my hands on that upcoming technical whitepaper.

405 2018-05-01 22:59:50 I hope they do well and succeed, someone (or multiple companies will), I just think that assuming PolyMath is going to be the saving grace of the security token market might be naive. People can invest in their token, so they're much more likely to push that narrative

409 2018-05-01 22:59:04 I bought in at ICO and looking for another entry here, I think it’s a real gem.
410 2018-05-01 22:58:55 I'm not a hater at all.. I should have said they didn't go the "token" route.. I just think adding a token into the ecosystem is added friction in comparison to the companies they're going to compete with. I've also spoke to people launching tokens who have preferred the comp.
411 2018-05-01 22:58:50 still down?

414 2018-05-01 22:58:12 When issuing as you have to purchase 10,000 poly to use probably some of the best OG’s spearheading the S.T.O movement with @OverstockCEO they were all recently in Asia promoting tZERO...what is everything one else doing.....trying to catch up...
415 2018-05-01 22:58:08 Exactly what I told myself
416 2018-05-01 22:58:02 Not too mention how troll the internet/twitch can be. It takes some insane mental stability.
417 2018-05-01 22:57:50 Are you paid to promote any crypto or cannabis companies?
418 2018-05-01 22:57:49 Talking to bankers about #bitcoin and #crypto is among some of the most fascinating thing in life 
419 2018-05-01 22:57:49 finally something i can show my friends that will educate them proper on what exactly crypto mining is
420 2018-05-01 22:57:49 The most controversial person in America right now is talking bitcoins you think that shit is random May is known for being a month crypto take off
421 2018-05-01 22:57:42 Eres un grande ! Pero falta educar la comunidad Crypto . Me siento orgulloso de tu talento y disciplina y honestidad al opinar sobre Nano.
422 2018-05-01 22:57:18 Really annoying when that happens  I'm holding but I bought in around 350-400 gwei so I'm still comfy. Seems like the sell of is slowing down, hopefully we find support here.
423 2018-05-01 22:57:08 Great day in #crypto
Y'all motherfuckers rejoice!
Kanye said Bitcoin.

424 2018-05-01 22:56:58 Yeh but a lot of people are blinding investing and then dismissing red flags when crypto is a liquid asset that you can sell any time you want. (I’ve even done it)
425 2018-05-01 22:56:52 .@binance has 7x the volume of @BittrexExchange
426 2018-05-01 22:56:49 Long live the Crypto-Republic!
427 2018-05-01 22:56:36 Model. Everything they have done so far has been exceptional. Unless your inside info is coming from extremely high quality sources like those names how can you truly be so sure you’re not wrong on this man?

443 2018-05-01 22:55:14 Um if a Crypto conference would generate a rally in and of itself we'd have nothing but one big non stop rallies so far this year....
444 2018-05-01 22:55:13 can you email me the transcript please?
445 2018-05-01 22:55:07 Word! Yeah definitely look through their articles on medium. I haven't been able to find a date for the conference as of yet tho.
446 2018-05-01 22:54:54 The complete inability to story the bike infrastructure. Bikes have been left abandoned for 6 toa9 months despite being reported weekly directly and by the authorities here in Singapore. The move into crypto by the founder to raise capital was a massive tell tale sign.

448 2018-05-01 22:54:50 I think you will say the same about $CLT CoinLoan if you check it out. Fiat loans for collateralized crypto ccy. Minimal marketing thus far but platform release in Q2. Your welcome 
449 2018-05-01 22:54:36 Applied Cryptography which masses call Blockchain technology, of cause I'm excited about wonder of mathematics not about shady projects which trying to shill by sticking "Crypto, Blockchain, Bitcoin, Token" to their names.
450 2018-05-01 22:54:35 Not sure I see connection, I place very little weight on Crypto period. As for the banks, the industry fundamentals are certainly MUCH more positive going forward than those in the NAND space. One is making $ as rates (and volatility) rise the other is losing pricing power
451 2018-05-01 22:54:09 All these technologies require further advancements. Like #crypto would need financial legitimacy maybe a bank or a guarantor that is recognized by the masses.

454 2018-05-01 22:53:29 Governance can be decentralized but no contributor should retain ownership or copyright to any part of it. The whole point of decentralization is so a project can't be harmed by a single drama queen.

there are stages. it feels linear but perhaps its cyclical. 

maybe i will return to having sparkles in my eyes but after a few years ive become a hard sell.

458 2018-05-01 22:53:03 Again @crypto_bobby I’m genuinely a fan of yours and I’m not saying advisors make the company execute but bro Trevor went to people like @stevennerayoff who invented the concept of GAS on ETH. @jeffpulver who created Voice over IP and had @diiorioanthony help cultviate the token

1) #BABB has huge potential... It is only words. U can apply it to any average #crypto project. Potential is just a "word" not a result.

2) 95% of crypto have no product. Ok. Show me please BABB product...

3) If they have the license... if if... It is only IF

463 2018-05-01 22:52:10 Should we all go sell bank stocks because Crypto “may” be gutting their core business models sometime in the unknown future?
464 2018-05-01 22:52:05 No, I like reading the tweets. Less intense.
465 2018-05-01 22:51:55 Okay.... so how do I capture the moment? :)

468 2018-05-01 22:51:23 Alt tarafı çok test ettiyse ve kıramadıysa evet bu dediğiniz mümkün olabilir. Ama burada mesela bollinger bantları değil, destek ve direncin kendisi. İyi kazançlar.
469 2018-05-01 22:51:02 Tired of ups and downs and selling all crypto today, #boringcrypto
470 2018-05-01 22:51:01 Can you explain to me why this is? Why do we NEED to? is it an undeniable law? or an extremely likely trend. Do you have a link where I can read more? Thanks!
471 2018-05-01 22:50:45 The crypto pump has started May is going to be a good month
472 2018-05-01 22:50:45 Teşekkür ederim. Ne demek istediğinizi şimdi daha iyi anladım ama yine de dediğim gibi, bollinger bantları buna işaret etmez. İşareti veren trendin kendisidir. Teorik olarak fiyat bir desteği bir çok defa deneyip kıramazsa o destekten seker diyebiliriz. +++
473 2018-05-01 22:50:22 What do you base your trades on if not TA?

Coins vs. Tokens
Coin:
- existing platform from a fork of another #blockchain or project that’s developing their own blockchain
- doesn’t need crowdfund
- either working product or product currently in dev
- does not require another projects tech to function

479 2018-05-01 22:49:30 I remember when alts officially came out of the cave, all the trading volume was happening on poloniex. Look at you now barely even relevant
480 2018-05-01 22:49:27 Just traded in most of my crypto for more silver. All I have left now is some htmlcoin and I will be receiving some vites soon but after I sell those coins I am done with crypto for a while.

483 2018-05-01 22:49:13 Biggest regret signed up to coinbase back in June 2017 but did not invest due to not believing in crypto back then but got in later in December due to FOMO and now my portfolio is down

488 2018-05-01 22:48:39 Siz bu strateji ile kazanabiliyorsanız diyecek lafım yok tabi. Ama ben de size kendi gözlem ve deneyimlerimle cevap veriyorum. Bollinger bantları kırılma yönğ hakkında bilgi vermez. Boğa piyasasındayız, artan trend de olultu daralma, yüzde 90 yukarı bekliyorum ama kesin diyemem

496 2018-05-01 22:47:54 Yeah the manual withdrawal especially. Hope they will not list there, but I place my bets on Hitbtc/Bitz/Lbank. The other top 10 are korean for the most and the others don't usually allow icos to disclose terms of listing. I will wait and see if the price dips. Project is bomb

507 2018-05-01 22:46:08 Very few ppl “get this”.  The market will never go to new highs (20K+) unless we bounce off a 4/5K bottom.
508 2018-05-01 22:46:04 If you expect TA to give you accurate predictions 100% of the time you have unrealistic expectations. It is probability-driven, and also done poorly by most people in crypto.
509 2018-05-01 22:45:35 You know #crypto is close to adoption when sexy selfies flood your feed.

533 2018-05-01 22:42:36 Furthermore, I think govt realize that the tokens are necessary for most of these chains, but that any company can build off of and use these ledgers. Playing with pink and purple we’ve made magenta. Now we need to define what magenta is and is not, but the tech is so new. Time.
534 2018-05-01 22:42:31 Yes, but to be fair Coinbase is crytpo exchange with 16m crypto users while SBI has a 8.5m traditional investors. Who knows how many will start buying crypto...
535 2018-05-01 22:42:26 I like twitter because you can be a fake/real expert on anything. You can also be nothing. I’m choosing to be a fake crypto expert today.
536 2018-05-01 22:41:52 Well this is interesting: "...the #SEC and #CFTC are questioning whether the creators of other cryptocurrencies, aside from bitcoin, ‘exert significant influence over their value in the same way a company’s stock price depends on its managers and their strategy..."
537 2018-05-01 22:41:44 Whenever they say crypto has no risk for global finance the bull run starts 
538 2018-05-01 22:41:38  Hmm... Let me have a look in my crystal ball to see the exact price.

572 2018-05-01 22:37:38 But not coming through with litepay and a way for stores to accept crypto currency is a big deal for any of this to be accepted mainstream we need things that bridge that gap.

We're nowhere close to the kind of mass adoption to crypto that is to come. The present state is not very user friendly to those who aren't as technologically inclined. BCH is deceptive and unhelpful to them.

673 2018-05-01 22:21:16 That 'thing' happening marked officially the "top" in January.
674 2018-05-01 22:21:01 Yesssss!!! I thought about doing that just the other day & it would be awesome if everyone did do that!!!!!! We are very fortunate to have some amazing men & women in crypto!!!! 
675 2018-05-01 22:21:00 I will when I get home. Thank You.

677 2018-05-01 22:20:42 Do you see TRX above $1 in 2019?
678 2018-05-01 22:20:29 Ethereum bouncing back nicely right now...glad to see the market shrug off this dip. big time crypto investors have it around $2500 by end of this year.
679 2018-05-01 22:20:27 Mentions the guy I was having keyboard war with from last night. Some tripped out shit !!! Hahahaha
680 2018-05-01 22:20:19 actually both scenarios win ;)
681 2018-05-01 22:20:17 I hope to be on the right side of the line if that happens, I did not believe u Bart Simpson last time.. it cost me time and almost 1000 dollars  per btc
682 2018-05-01 22:20:14 My goal is 1 year of living expenses from crypto profits before I even think of quitting my day job.
683 2018-05-01 22:20:11 biggest regret is not getting out of listening to mainstream media 5/10 yrs back. In Jan 2013 LTC was 3 cents, similar price for BTC in 2010. One day, the whole world will realise how they been lied to by mainstream media, but only after crypto take off in to outer space 
684 2018-05-01 22:20:08 Do you care to offer a single amount of evidence or are you simply trying to FUD Pump your bag of @neonexchange ??? Well?

694 2018-05-01 22:18:34 “The market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.”

This is the reason why I mainly focus on long positions and tend to HODL. I have never seen so many impatient people as in #crypto

Btw: it’s paying off big time already

695 2018-05-01 22:18:28 lol...Ven doesnt even need a token and should be built on ETH using ETH as gas to execute its code. A high velocity utility token surpassing the most decentralized smart contract platform with thousands of the smartest devs all around the world working on it? smh

711 2018-05-01 22:16:21 I really didn't expect my tweet to cause such a backlash from the crypto contingent. I just thought it was a fun fact that she had written her journal in code.

714 2018-05-01 22:16:06 Why does everyone have to be so down on this story? Consider the time (age) and the backgrounds of this involved. Once upon a time ROT13 would have been difficult to crack. We benefit from living in a time of broader education, regular crypto use, and the web. Be thankful.

2. If you judge a fish by how it walks it will think its a failure. Same for you and marketing (not your forte) swim baby swim!
3. Amazing adoption so far, yet looks like turtle in a hare race

757 2018-05-01 22:10:29 A good amount of these crypto airdrops I'm signing up for stated Blockchain 3.0, are releasing tokens on the Ethereum chain, have disruptive tech and are slated for launch between May and August/September at latest. Could $ZeU / $SX be involved? @ZeUCrypto
758 2018-05-01 22:10:26 I'm an early investor in #babb
1) 95% of crypto  have no  product
2) #babb has a huge potential
3) I agree ,@getbabb must show more respect toward the community on exchanges
4) regulators don't  like token funds, seems true
5) If they had the bank licence it would be 0,20$
759 2018-05-01 22:10:21 Maybe Hudson Bay Capital waited to see how the preliminary injunction will look? It's becoming much clearer that $LFIN has no future after judge's ruling, so renegotiating and getting shares would not be a good move for them and bankruptcy of $LFIN is their best option.
760 2018-05-01 22:10:12 He just said he will share once he’s done accumulating 
761 2018-05-01 22:10:12 Not to deny anything, but the article also sais: ‘The good news for crypto investors is that the prospects of the SEC taking action are remote.’

793 2018-05-01 22:04:57 I understand that fully. I'm speaking up for the sake of the masses entering crypto who will never understand the technicals behind that drama.

804 2018-05-01 22:03:18 No problem, you have a valid point. My opinion is quite simple, as long as the game (overvaluation) doesn't change I will keep playing along. Compared to other utility tokens, POLY is still very attractive in my opinion.

842 2018-05-01 21:59:34 Sounds to me you think they’re all a scam. Yet you continue to make money from them. Don’t get me wrong I don’t trust anyone, corporation or govt but had twitter been around someone probably would have said IBM was a scam or that Google was a P&D. Gotta be a bag holder sometime.

890 2018-05-01 21:53:46 ETH May have been first to market but I think Vitalik rushed the project without thinking about all the small issues that have come up since it’s release. Slow TPS (fixed with Casper) high trx fees, slow trxs, security flaws, not enterprise friendly etc. I have doubts about ETH.
891 2018-05-01 21:53:39 I think we may be going down soon $BTC
892 2018-05-01 21:53:39 An easy way to determine whether a #ether was purchased for utility or investment is to see how much of the supply is held out of circulation. Hodlers are easy to identify

895 2018-05-01 21:53:23 And to give a different answer: 99,99% of all utility tokens are grossly overvalued. Security tokens will be the big capital
896 2018-05-01 21:53:16 You’re not keeping up with this coin. Suggest you sit down for an hour and catch up @vechainofficial
897 2018-05-01 21:53:16 Why would anyone care about the supply number of an $altcoin?  Now i can understand why you would care about future supply as opposed to current supply but if we’re talking a static supply, it should mean nothing.

906 2018-05-01 21:51:50 when most other tokens get a securities tag they tend to dump because of a risk factor until the new legal framework is signed. it would also reflect upon ETC and other tokens. you can trade those tokens to fiat and or usdt in most cases so it hit overall market cap.

946 2018-05-01 21:46:46 Taking a break from charting for a day or so. I feel it is important to not allow crypto to take over your entire soul. Some days you have to leave the digital world and enjoy reality whilst it is here. Trade safe loveys 
947 2018-05-01 21:46:43 I'm conflicted about this. On one hand, paying off the mortgage with btc could result in us owning the most expensive house ever, but the house will be paid off if we ever see that $3000 that people were tweeting about 2 weeks ago. #Dunno

950 2018-05-01 21:46:30 While you are at it, is there actually any prof. liability insurance covering crypto? It was pain to get even a general IT/soft dev coverage for a regular startup..

953 2018-05-01 21:45:56 Sounds like in the clip he was talking about pure enlightenment consciousness, far more important than crypto lol
954 2018-05-01 21:45:50 Thank master lee
955 2018-05-01 21:45:43 The final count down has already started. Bethereum ICO is around the  corner and we must be prepared to support it, believe on it and bet our ethers on it

956 2018-05-01 21:45:42 Good for you. Maybe your miners are newly set-up? I’m still waiting for mine to be fixed. Sent the support my nth time message.. same response.. “still fixing the issue..”

961 2018-05-01 21:45:08 Bitcoin is the standard and the core of everything in crypto but we didn't expected this projection. Few people own heavy loaded btc wallets, also there is a big industry based on blockchain that's willing to grow. I am with you but we have to be opened to changes

963 2018-05-01 21:44:56 My impression of most BCH proponents is, that they don't think about the demand side of the crypto market. Profitable mining needs enough demand for the produced good. They are mostly fighting for the supply side, the miners.
964 2018-05-01 21:44:46 Well his exchange certainly won't be "taking off" if they try to ban privacy coins.

The crypto community will not stand for it.

990 2018-05-01 21:42:21 Agree on security tokens/tokenization of assets, but not convinced $POLY will be the company to do it. It's probably not a popular opinion, but there are companies that don't have a token model that are moving quickly in this space and taking market share.

996 2018-05-01 21:42:03 The whole markrt tanked at about the same percentage did charlie selling his ltc cause bitcoin to lose 55% of ath or eth or 95% of the crypto on the market. You obviously dont own a diverse portfolio if you cant see it rode the same wave the entire market did
997 2018-05-01 21:42:01 This isn't an "ENTER ALL CRYPTO MARKETS" tweet. This isn't a call to take profits on the way up or live with the consequences.

999 2018-05-01 21:41:55 I totally agree and those that invest wisely now in long term Crypto projects and other aspects of Blockchain will be in a great position within the next 5 years.

1076 2018-05-01 21:34:15 I'm mainly interested in physical security & mobility; digital security is more difficult to quantify for most people. Things like the device type/OS help. The intention of the study is to see whether threshold crypto (distributes private data across devices) is practical.
1077 2018-05-01 21:34:12 Just ran into a high school friend while wearing my LTC shirt, had a good convo about LTC, cryptocurrencies, and starting up a crypto club that I've been wanting to do at my UNI. Didn't expect that to brighten my day. #wearlitecoin

1083 2018-05-01 21:33:09 He even had one going up $8, there's better guys out here then this bot.
1084 2018-05-01 21:33:02 RT @KryptoLad: @Crypto_Ed_NL Had the same thought earlier this day.The more I hear about it, the more bullish I get. But even if that doesn't happen, a project like $VEN should be above bcash in mcap. That's 10x at the moment, which is quite good. And will be even more as $B…
1085 2018-05-01 21:32:51 Cqn you explain please how does ETH impact on the market sentiment more then BTC on May 7th?

1098 2018-05-01 21:32:09 On a recent @SkyNews interview I put my neck out and said $crypto has a great chance of hitting a $2 Trillion market cap by end of 2018.

1101 2018-05-01 21:31:50 Just been laughing at all those doubting and FUDing ETH. It's why we are where we are (imense opportunity), it's not going anywhere, and he is still the brightest mind in Crypto. Ask the experts.

Charlie - Do you honestly still feel it can be a major crypto currency and will Litecoin’s value ever reach above $350 again . . ?
1115 2018-05-01 21:30:33 That's why I plan on just holding for at least a year. It was the initial plan. This CEO @AmandoBoncales  must have an open mind  and trust the people he appointed in each department. A leader must keep a good vibe and a good working environement. Stagnation is never good.

1144 2018-05-01 21:27:15 I think having a more mainstream, vocal, pro-active lead is important. I follow you a lot and generally like your work but think you operate too much within the crypto comfort zone, time for litecoin to get out there!! #ToTheMoon

1150 2018-05-01 21:26:15 If you have a crypto supported by that chain, you don't need an exchange to escape volatility (like now people do getting USDT, which is not really audited yet people trust it), you just burn at the current USD rate of the coin  being burnt.

1152 2018-05-01 21:26:14 I don’t think they are going to try to regulate the one crypto they have been putting their money in .
1153 2018-05-01 21:26:10 On @SkyNews recently  I stated that $crypto has a big chance of having a $2 TRILLION market cap by the end of 2018. The reason being that large pension funds, hedge funds, family offices, sovereign wealth funds hadn't even got stuck in yet.

1191 2018-05-01 21:22:03 At the “successful crypto investing” panel, the VC’s are talking about people going to jail and the crypto-maximalist founder of a blockchain tech company is about to jump outta his seat. #CryptoInvestSummit #CryptoLife

1205 2018-05-01 21:21:04 You guys don't seem to understand that emerging markets is really the only play at this point. If crypto can become a standard in emerging markets, it can capture the necessary market share to make it a viable player in the larger global economy: Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Phillipines
1206 2018-05-01 21:20:43 Nice marketing campaign btw 
1207 2018-05-01 21:20:27 You call that going down, and you can’t even call that a pump. Insider trading ???? For a 15-20% gain lol I see that on every coin at least twice a week. Mate, it’s either your account was hacked or you are just really dumb.

1219 2018-05-01 21:19:33 The more u think about crypto the more u begin to understand it’s a pyramid scheme . Reselling the same vapor ( a digital bit that produces nothing just exists) to the next sucker who pays more. My question is how is this even legal?
1220 2018-05-01 21:19:31 It’s such a slow mover though!
1221 2018-05-01 21:19:27 Any other @LehighU alum out there in the Blockchain & Crypto ecosystem? Would like to get the ball rolling on some sort of event alongside the Lehigh Wall St. Council.

1229 2018-05-01 21:18:50 That's a moot point... Bitmain's success is tied to the success of the crypto space, and the only way the crypto space survives is if adoption beats out old-world institutions co-opting the tech. OB is a great way to increase adoption; it's a win-win.

1250 2018-05-01 21:16:47 Crypto is not all technology tho, Charlie sold his Litecoin at ATH and that was a bad business move because it would attract less investors. Either way your still up but Charlie should probably buy back in just for investors sake.

1274 2018-05-01 21:14:21 Well, not declaring cryptos as part of your investments, as it has happened with other investments, will make your investments in crypto to be inaccessible when you are gone.
1275 2018-05-01 21:14:16 With the value of crypto coins on the rise, the wealth accumulated by those investing in the coins is, without doubt, a fortune. But do you know that your crypto fortune is likely to be beneficial to you and you only?
1276 2018-05-01 21:14:16 むしろ逆ですよ、実需では自国通貨に信用のない発展途上国の方が仮想通貨が広まる可能性がある。現金主義でろくにキャッシュレス化しない日本では金とかと同じ扱いのままでしょうね。
1277 2018-05-01 21:13:57 @MyColossalShow These Crypto people are so fucking arrogant. They cant even comprehend the difference between speculation and investing.

1371 2018-05-01 21:04:35 In the long term maybe but this chart only goes forward a month or so. Can still play out for this reason. Until correlation is broken and bitcoin is seen as safe haven it's not a safe haven like gold.

1377 2018-05-01 21:04:14 I still have faith in this. The project is good, and who knows what the future team can achieve
1378 2018-05-01 21:04:11 Dacht even hetzelfde. Tis dan x30 of x100 grofweg. Neem aan dat Ed hier mcap bedoelt (dus x30) anders krijg je een mcap van 250B (met een prijs rond de 550 usd) 
1379 2018-05-01 21:03:51 Welp, let’s really hope this news pans out. I still am confident in the team and what they are up. Going to check out the beta version. Thanks for the idex direction.

1444 2018-05-01 20:58:11 Global market uncertainty due to risk of war outbreak in mideast, bitcoin currently somewhat correlated to spx500. That's a reason.

1446 2018-05-01 20:58:02 do you know how they work ;)?
1447 2018-05-01 20:58:02 Reducing support and opportunities. Bashing another project also turns supporters off as they are invested in other projects besides LTC. U are a huge face in crypto that had a massive positive following. Feed on the positive my man. LTC is a better currency than BTC IMO.

1462 2018-05-01 20:56:50 There is also this little gem in their statement:

"While we remain a crypto-only exchange *for now*"
1463 2018-05-01 20:56:17 If you can't do basic research crypto isn't for you. Digital Currency Group has poured money into Blockstream. Look at their advisor Glenn Hutchins. He's also a board member for The Federal Reserve. AXA is a seed investor for Blockstream. Its CEO is Henri De Castries. Look him up
1464 2018-05-01 20:56:11 Got to be! The quicker crypto get regulated the better! What’s the downside? If there is one, someone please educate me.... cause I don’t don’t see it
1465 2018-05-01 20:56:00 It’s not complicated. Once regulated exchanges like @tzeroblockchain, @coinlist or even @Nasdaq go live with secondary crypto trading platforms, the smart money will be there ready and waiting. The concerns are around liquidity, security, counterparty risk and custody of assets.
1466 2018-05-01 20:55:54 Been raking these bad boys in for months!
1467 2018-05-01 20:55:53 Tbh, I want to see a smaller dip.  I cashed out just before and would like to get more for cheaper.  Just but sure when.
1468 2018-05-01 20:55:49 We are accumulating though. Im trying to figure this puzzle out myself.
1469 2018-05-01 20:55:42 If you are a crypto investor I highly recommend watching the tv series Silicon Valley

1504 2018-05-01 20:51:30 I should have started this social media thing years ago when I started investing crypto. Its hell of a lot harder growing your followers than it is to grow your profits in crypto. Its okay. Someday it will be my time to shine

1509 2018-05-01 20:51:08 You either need fiat dollar or fiat crypto to support the existence and the usefulness of pm/s. Which do you prefer to move forward with?
1510 2018-05-01 20:51:07 How many times r people going to try this? No #Crypto Community would ask someone to send them n e thing for a prize.
1511 2018-05-01 20:51:01 Crypto is fiat but it is a form of a decentralized virtual currency, which is why it is better than centralized fiat. Now, here is where you lack the understanding. Gold and silver cannot be trading vehicles because they are too heavy to carry around...

Come on @LFC you can do it........
1521 2018-05-01 20:50:22 Yep, but I don't see how the rationale of Canadian Tire money having higher value or Nunavut moving to our own crypto-currency is a solution that works

1526 2018-05-01 20:50:06 @Forbes writer seems to think DECENTRALIZATION is the problem of modern cryptocurrencies. Our response: First watch “Rules without Rulers” by Andreas Antonopolous ( @aantonop  ). Then, we can talk. #DEX #crypto #cryptocurrency #btc #bitcoin #altcoin

1528 2018-05-01 20:50:04 Agree. David has a long history of being level-headed and fair. 

I think the entire #crypto community would benefit from “a skeptics point of view” with thoughtful questions and direct answers. 

Positive David would end up conceding a few points if the arguments were sound.

1543 2018-05-01 20:48:10 Yeah right I mean if bank after bank begins going bust, there's only a few options after that. And crypto will be no. 1

1545 2018-05-01 20:47:54 It’s easy to make money in crypto when having more than 100K followers. You buy any coin, any, start shilling it like crazy, wait and take profits. Easy. Just wondering about those who say “good call!” 
1546 2018-05-01 20:47:43 We must take heed to how this new transaction-based digital infrastructure (crypto) evolves. Do not let the state takes control in the name of national security, avoid the mark of the beast.

a lot of factors have the chart looking a bit bouncy come may 4 & 5...cycles, astrology, previous market patterns.

if eth goes poorly say goodnight to crypto for a while. if well, we could still grind up past 11k in the mid term.

1628 2018-05-01 20:39:10 I'd distinguish social proof from concrete recommendation.  The latter is critical to determine which arguments to take time to hear.  And even there, almost everyone in crypto relies heavily on experts in other fields, since it operates at the intersection of so many fields.

1654 2018-05-01 20:36:47 (3)Also remember, most people in wallstreet have spoken out against crypto and they hate it. These people are the target market for NYSE. So if they did add it, a lot of those people would be pissed. For that reason, I doubt they will anytime soon. Most Baby boomers hate crypto.

1661 2018-05-01 20:36:11 Ok now that's a better review :)
1662 2018-05-01 20:36:04 Love that city
1663 2018-05-01 20:36:02 I'd say that's more a deterrent to growth than a threat to its existence. I agree, though, the crypto community hasn't gotten there yet for mainstream usability and has a long way to go.
1664 2018-05-01 20:35:45 What’s an irl friend?
1665 2018-05-01 20:35:36 Thanks
1666 2018-05-01 20:35:30 Not yet, but just wait 10 years. Demographics there are almost ready.
1667 2018-05-01 20:35:21 that’s just one investment! wow I think profit wise + investment is much more then $2.3mil in total. Once proper numbers come in later this year I honestly think we will get to 100p in time. I believe in crypto and the future of it so this stock is the best one to have. #KR1
1668 2018-05-01 20:35:20 who the hell is still in stocks, seriously? the banking sector isn’t the only one going to be hurt by crypto. the stock market will also be replaced.
1669 2018-05-01 20:35:16 hey peter i watched your video calling all crypto youtubers and wanted to get in touch with ya . my channel is only small been going for 5 months now and have 1150 subscribers not sure if thats big enough for your idea?
1670 2018-05-01 20:35:15 garbage
1671 2018-05-01 20:35:11 Thanks crypto, today is shaping up well.  A good handful of my coins are double digit up.

1673 2018-05-01 20:35:02 Bitcoin Rhodium? whats that??
1674 2018-05-01 20:34:55 @Cerberus_Crypto  hey, I tried using discord to invite myself from the link on your website. But I get an error message saying invite has expired...I need assistance with masternode setup
1675 2018-05-01 20:34:48 Shitcoins you can consider as a closed box, because noone would buy BTCP directly, without owning BTC. So the audience on crypto twitter is the same, pro or contra BTCP. BTC and other bigger coins are opened, as the audience is a lot larger.
1676 2018-05-01 20:34:45 Our favorite crypto friend is amazing!!  Love

1678 2018-05-01 20:34:35 Crypto
1679 2018-05-01 20:34:34 Handletime! Can't touch this.
1680 2018-05-01 20:34:26 add BTCP the best crypto
1681 2018-05-01 20:34:20 Helps the cause as long as they are keeping in line with the fundamentals of crypto. Stating ETH is not a security is in line.
1682 2018-05-01 20:34:18 Just get out of that Brazil shithole. And if you have enough money, get yourself directely into one of the good countries like New Zealand, Australia or Switzerland.
1683 2018-05-01 20:34:16 I have been  telling everyone about $fsn for months now, I also released a video on why I think fusion can give better returns than $wan. Now we see it, buts its only the beginning. #fusion #wanchain

1689 2018-05-01 20:33:50 But then ur view would be the same as mine like I said, our reference was too low so almost anything is better xD
1690 2018-05-01 20:33:40 This is wrong. And you get it even more when you change the name of the crime by another crime.
1691 2018-05-01 20:33:37 This is great and all, but none of this matters until LTC is implemented.  Early announcements with long wait times is quickly becoming a pet peave of mine in the world of crypto.  I would much prefer an announcement after implementation or right before it is done.
1692 2018-05-01 20:33:34 Whats the case name and case number to order the transcript?
1693 2018-05-01 20:33:30 J'ai du mal à être convaincu par #ICX.  J'en ai mais suis pas encore dans l'idée d'un bag à #hodl
1694 2018-05-01 20:33:27 Nice view bro
1695 2018-05-01 20:33:25 well all take that L in the beginning one way or another! 
1696 2018-05-01 20:33:24 Missing crypto like  @RevolutApp
1697 2018-05-01 20:33:15 $5B collectively raised in ICOs this past year is just the tip of the iceberg.  

Tokenized securities are going to free up trillions of dollars in illiquid assets by bring blockchain technology to their core.

Feel like you missed the boat on crypto? We’re just getting started
1698 2018-05-01 20:33:13 Gold is the ulimate safe heaven, and it would good if you put 10% in risky crypto
1699 2018-05-01 20:33:13 the VeChainThor Platform is going to change the world around you with or without your knowledge of it.

I hate that I have to do this, but can we please have some sense crypto peeps? 

Dumb things I have seen today:
- People FOMOing into $HOT.  This coin was listed 3 days ago and was trading at 6x(or more) ico price.  What the hell were people thinking?
1723 2018-05-01 20:30:44 In few years @HeyRhett will have more forks that IBM has blockchains.
1724 2018-05-01 20:30:20 :) do u think after which point we can say it is going or what is resistance?
1725 2018-05-01 20:30:19 VCs lobbying for specific outcomes in crypto has a very troubled history, but I think whether it helps or hurts depends on the way crypto users react.

1727 2018-05-01 20:30:15 It's my aging co-workers birthday and I thought it'd be a good idea to give him $BTC. This would be his official investment into crypto, as he's been peering over my shoulder at the concept. However, @coinbase  is clunky AF on a PC. Not a great start.

Privacy domains will be more sought after than crypto domains
1746 2018-05-01 20:28:55 I’m with you man. Seems like so much of the Crypto space is missing the point completely. Too much speculation and too little support/engagement with the best products/ideas
1747 2018-05-01 20:28:53 If you get scammed by these twitter accounts they are doing you a favour.

1796 2018-05-01 20:24:05 If you really want to get down to it, put simply: Everything is a pyramid scheme. Anything you buy/trade is done in hopes that someone else will pay more for it. Our economy is on the verge of collapse. I suggest getting into crypto.

1811 2018-05-01 20:23:26 It appears that we will have the judge's decision on the preliminary injunction against $LFIN today. Among other things, the SEC must establish that they are likely to succeed on the merits. 

Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer so there are things I might be misunderstanding.
1812 2018-05-01 20:23:19 Even before @NNTaleb brought the matter to greater prominence, my view was that anyone in the crypto space who doesn't have most of his or her assets in the vehicle being promoted should be ignored. There are plenty of others who have ample skin in their game.
1813 2018-05-01 20:23:17 Nice shot

1817 2018-05-01 20:22:52 $BPT ?
1818 2018-05-01 20:22:48 Once your crypto has been hacked and then that’s it – game over. There’s no comeback and no one to complain to.
1819 2018-05-01 20:22:48 So we could say the same for people that are invested and are PRO $BTC as opposed to non crypto $BTC investors. Bitcoin then would be a saturated trade too, as alot of Bitcoin evangelists have alot of support from the community on social media as opposed to a non believer 
1820 2018-05-01 20:22:40 LOL, makes sense to give away those ETH in this thread, but it's a scam
1821 2018-05-01 20:22:26 Diamond in the rough meaning a gem surrounded by a ton of mud (shit projects with no vision)
1822 2018-05-01 20:22:25 You Crazy? Why on Earth would I send BTC for more BTC? Vertcoin is the new bitcoin. Atomic Swaps Fam! :)

1825 2018-05-01 20:22:07 They are not “going to open” a crypto exchange. They said they would be open to it in the future.  #cryptocurrency
1826 2018-05-01 20:22:07 Scam!!! Reported and blocked in a few minutes ...

1912 2018-05-01 20:15:16 Just reading in the WSJ about “ether” the crypto currency.  I am skeptical about the currencies in general, and see them as analogous to a Picasso, where as I’ve said before, the wiser money moves east.

1991 2018-05-01 20:07:09 Trying to explain to newcomers how you transfer fiat into crypto is not easy. First  coinbase then find an exchange  then transfer from coinbase to exchange..Now it can be just set up a $coss account and you're sorted. less transfer  fees also. #crypto #$coss

SBI's exchange is expected to have 8.5m users at launch. SBI had $2.2B revenue in 2016. Coinbase has 16m users and had $1B revenue in 2017.

If you look at the numbers, SBI's exchange will be bigger than Coinbase!

2110 2018-05-01 19:52:27 Yep...I can only echo Mike Maloneys sentiments. Your podcasts got me on the road to the world of crypto too...thanks from me as well  Mike, you helped my education on what money is - thanks also to you - please keep up the great work both of you!!
2111 2018-05-01 19:52:27 I'm waiting for people to answer
2112 2018-05-01 19:52:12 Congrats! Would love to connect! We at @3PTsComm have a number of clients that are doing different, but exciting things in the retail and institutional crypto space.
2113 2018-05-01 19:52:08 Crypto is range bound. Aka considation.

Bitcoin is sitting right on its fair value range.
We are monitoring $bch to play catch up. But it's going to take a while.

There isn't anything new to add. Like watching paint dry
2114 2018-05-01 19:52:05 More ways to bring new investors in to crypto!  Easy in and easy out from fiat will make mainstream adoption a reality.
2115 2018-05-01 19:51:51 Bitrust @BTF_PROJECT Interesting project, I am interested in it from the start. Crypto-market is not stable, losses are inevitable. They help protect your cryptocurrency value from sudden market drops. # BITRUST is a peer-to-peer insurance platform for cryptocurrency owners.
2116 2018-05-01 19:51:48 @hitbtc HitBTC never gave our promised #IGNIS from the NXT fork. They stole people's coins. That's a disgrace to the crypto-world

2121 2018-05-01 19:51:23 Make sure you know your exits and take profit on the way up.

Nothing goes up forever, and it doesn’t go up in a straight line.

Easier to prevent panic selling when you have made some money and have liquidity.

If you can do that reliably, you will make money in crypto

2129 2018-05-01 19:49:37 Traders cause pump and dumps in crypto. A coin does not classify as a "scam" (e.g $xvg) because traders sold their shares. Please use the definition of a "scam" correctly. Bitconnect was a scam

2132 2018-05-01 19:49:29 $Crypto just closed april 2018, this month was fantastic, both in fiat and $BTC, keep in mind the BIG waves are still to come!
2133 2018-05-01 19:49:18 Is there anyway people can profit through spreading adoption through merchant processing presenting merchants with crypto acceptance? And what program as far as software etc would be needed?

2136 2018-05-01 19:48:32 The funny thing about crypto is, people don’t think it be like it is, but it do.
2137 2018-05-01 19:48:25 I would go for it but I’ve seen divergences on posted charts (3D) that indicate we go up
2138 2018-05-01 19:48:24 In a rational world, the Krügermobile would know no limits.

2140 2018-05-01 19:48:14 @crypto_rand I added some $ETC ,  squeeze is looking great, I saw like multiple news on the forum and volume is coming back slowly. Hard to decide if the timing is right compared to some others tho
2141 2018-05-01 19:48:12 Lol no.
2142 2018-05-01 19:48:12 I think these are some ethical standards that needs to be  followed by everyone in the crypto space to better reflect the market price.

2145 2018-05-01 19:47:42 Interesting follow-up question if Ethereum is deemed a security: what will the effect be on the BTC price near term?
I think the market will be spooked and everything will dump, "crypto-panick" style (with enormous "quick flip" potential).
Curious to hear your thoughts?
2146 2018-05-01 19:47:38 Let's enjoy crypto. we are early adopters and privileged to be able to directly message the founder of a multimillion dollar company and get honest replies. Which other corporation is as honest with every tweet?? And why do the trolls always reply within 50secs. Losers!
2147 2018-05-01 19:47:25 I get your point. But I'm sure that, firstly, you should not mix up blockchain as the core technology with BTC as one of its "products". Secondly, 10-year old tech product should be considered as quite mature one taking in consideration the speed of innovation progress nowadays.
2148 2018-05-01 19:47:18 If my Alts don't 10x this week I am pulling out of crypto

2160 2018-05-01 19:46:11 Broadening patterns are kind of rare from what I've read and I haven't seen them play out very often in crypto, but maybe. I already de-risked from alts, mainly because btc dominance is at 37% and running flat. Could still see pumps on select alts, but nothing like April, imo.
2161 2018-05-01 19:46:00 People keep saying #htmlcoin is dead.... apparently these people don’t keep up with the updates.  For those of you who think it’s dead, it’s being added to hitbtc in a few weeks.  You’re about to miss a nice gain.  $html #crypto

2187 2018-05-01 19:42:48 Absolutely! Though I think the chances of a coin getting the supply right for their target use case, transaction size now and transaction size at full adoption is very very low. But at least at current it's an important factor in investor psychology and valuation.
2188 2018-05-01 19:42:43 Interesting... I wonder how many people put Technicals, but are actually losing money most of the time with technicals, but still making money because of all the great fundamentals of crypto... (myself included maybe?)

2279 2018-05-01 19:33:33 @p2pfinancenews Interesting read on the HMRC update on crypto, that's something I've been wondering about for a while.
2280 2018-05-01 19:33:16 Correct me if I am wrong, but wasn't it you saying a couple of months ago: 'If you want to quit your job to trade crypto you should have done it 3 years ago' ??
2281 2018-05-01 19:32:43 True. It bothers me that "anarchism" has a "left-wing" connotation to it.

Still, I think fighting statism is more important than fighting the left. (Because then at least being on the left or right becomes a choice).

What saves me a bit is how crypto is associated with anarchy.
2282 2018-05-01 19:32:39 OPEN will open up crypto market for the masses.

2400 2018-05-01 19:15:20 I have to agree. Regulation isn’t going to kill crypto. Slow it at best. It’s immutable, that’s the point.
2401 2018-05-01 19:15:15 All to often lately, the word "scam" is thrown around as a euphemism for "threat to my favourite #crypto." It rarely means an *actual* scam (IOW fraud) anymore, and that's troubling.

2406 2018-05-01 19:14:47 It's probably the feeling of safety as well (also proving they don't really believe in their own strategy in the first place) - if something goes wrong, there is temptation to quickly retrieve the money.

2408 2018-05-01 19:14:29 I get tired off all these “experts” trying to kill the crypto currency space by saying its a scam... like stock brokers are angels. What about, Bernie Madoff, Jordan Belfort shit they have a whole fucking channel dedicated to these ripoff artist called American Greed. #truth
2409 2018-05-01 19:14:10 Regulation isn’t the threat you think it is. It actually looks that regulation will improve crypto adoption - just ask the institutional funds on the side line waiting for their custodians to be fully regulated.
2410 2018-05-01 19:14:06 We need a new commission whose sole purpose is regulating crypto assets, so the SEC can stop trying to apply umbrella policy to everything.

2421 2018-05-01 19:13:03 There's a giant difference between ledger maximalism and simply "my protocol vision is best"-ism. Ledger maximalism is the very essense of sound money. The choice among versions of a ledger (BCH, BTC, etc.) shouldn't be called maximalism in the crypto sense, just view on winner.
2422 2018-05-01 19:12:45 I would rather spend that money investing in more crypto or businesses that can appreciate. That just me, make money work for me.

B. I’m deep in #crypto, however I’m not saying a word to anyone, as I would be afraid people would only see #money in me.

2518 2018-05-01 19:05:34 I wish I had a ticket for @coindesk Consensus. If anyone has a press pass or extra ticket hook a crypto bro bro up. I'll be standing outside waiting to speak with attendees either way. I gotta find @SatoshiLite @Excellion @WhalePanda and @fluffypony for them stickers! 
2519 2018-05-01 19:05:06 #BTC Scenario 1: The 8800$ was the bounce to 11470$ (within next week).
Scenario 2: If Bears break 8800, short to 8400 and then Long again

2526 2018-05-01 19:04:19 imagine wanting twitter followers more than wanting to be a successful trader... yeah helping others is important but if I can’t help myself i’m no use to any person that follows me.

2531 2018-05-01 19:03:21 Or do both? disagree that you should own your own home before investing in crypto - that’s been made almost impossible without insane levels of debt for most
2532 2018-05-01 19:03:16 Extremely interesting project. I happily share useful information with my friends Join ICO  Excellent idea, talented team. Check out the white paper for @BittwattPteLtd #Bittwatt #Crypto #token

2534 2018-05-01 19:02:40 The most widely used currency for criminal use remains fiat. Don't be fooled by people/organizations who have a stake in crypto's demise.

2540 2018-05-01 19:01:59 I'm confused. 18 seconds to make the text or the art. And are you a human, an ai, both? Are you peaceful. Do you want to harvest me for resources?
2541 2018-05-01 19:01:38 Lol, I love crypto.
2542 2018-05-01 19:01:37 I'm spending a lot of time in trading channels and noticing a huge trend that folks would be far better off to prioritize basic saving and investing outside crypto. Or invest their time and energy in building a skill or business.
2543 2018-05-01 19:01:35 $MOIN allows for shadowsend, encrypted messaging, and 10% PoS. It also means "hello" in German, which also makes it a good reason to invest. #crypto

2546 2018-05-01 19:01:23 I voted for you guys in binance. So whats the go with this bounty? Should we have received it by now?
2547 2018-05-01 19:01:23 Elle est vraiment pas top en plus...
2548 2018-05-01 19:01:06 You must be honest in your analysis, or we'll see right through you, and you will lose credibility right off the bat. Crypto is going to be the future, and here to stay. Make sure you are there with it.
2549 2018-05-01 19:01:01 Working today and one of my customers now has 2 other vendors accepting crypto besides me. Huge contrast from a year ago. Anyone else seeing more and more saturation and usage?  #using #cryptocurrency
2550 2018-05-01 19:00:55 Que the Crypto/Blockchain talks again.
2551 2018-05-01 19:00:53 Here I am. Waiting.
"For what," you ask?
For @Ripple to partner with @Square of course. Gotta get in that retail space quick before they catch on and start adopting to crypto all by themselves.
2552 2018-05-01 19:00:47 C’est grâce a eux que certains gagnent non? 
2553 2018-05-01 19:00:42 Done! Congrats.
2554 2018-05-01 19:00:36 Wow, thanks. Wasn't expecting a reply. Makes sense at first glance. I'm definitely gonna play with that some later. Thank you much.
2555 2018-05-01 19:00:30 So we are all in agreement that the National day to celebrate #Crypto is January 12th correct? (The day the 1st #bitcoin transaction posted)

#SatoshiDay
2556 2018-05-01 19:00:28 I've used bcash to move holdings around. I was not impressed. The fastest crypto in the west is dogecoin in my experience. Even litecoin can take a minute. Regardless it's fun to move money from end to end with little friction.

2570 2018-05-01 18:59:54 Exactly. But American culture is so pervasive it bleeds through here in some really damaging ways. Keep that culture war bullshit across the Atlantic thanks very much

2574 2018-05-01 18:59:28 He will probably block me now since I had the mind and guts to say what most people want to say. Like I said....he looks like a guy Inwould have beers with but will never take crypto advice from. All in love and respect. Not trying to create any waves.
2575 2018-05-01 18:59:18 Oh wait, it's not going down right now?
2576 2018-05-01 18:59:08 @EuropeanCryptoB ECB is very breathtaking, I got very excited about it, and I also want to say about the genius of the idea, because now this is the main thing in the crypto industry. And I want to wish you good luck
2577 2018-05-01 18:58:42 I can't be the only one being skeptical.
2578 2018-05-01 18:58:42 Just had to retweet that
2579 2018-05-01 18:58:35 Time to start our discussion posts for our #crypto community!
There will be a question released every half hour concerning our topic of the day today: ASIC mining.

To start things off - general opinions. ASIC mining: good for crypto or bad for crypto?
2580 2018-05-01 18:58:35 He's from India.
2581 2018-05-01 18:58:18 Everybody who invests in crypto is prepared,who cares wheather it is a gain or a loss,but nobody puts money anywhere,its calked investment dear
2582 2018-05-01 18:58:16 @DeepOnionx made one of the most smoothest airdrops in the crypto history. Serious project, serious devs, big community. And once the #DeepSend is out ,it will become one of the top #privacycoins.
2583 2018-05-01 18:58:12 So that excludes most millennials then? And therefore a gigantic section of the population who would be most likely to benefit from crypto?
2584 2018-05-01 18:57:48 You should be focusing on crypto currency wallets and cards as that will be how payments are made in the future. Be ahead of the game $LTC $XVG $BTC #LitecoinNation #LitecoinPayments #Vergecurrency The future is in Crypto!

2591 2018-05-01 18:56:31 Basically what every crypto junkie says.  And you think they are all right??   HA.
2592 2018-05-01 18:56:18 I guess it's especially hard in crypto to create concensus when everyone's portfolio is involved and everyone is shilling coins. It shouldn't be a problem in discussing regulation but well... sometimes it just pops up and then it starts.
2593 2018-05-01 18:56:16 Cryptocurrency is a terrible master but an excellent servant!!

2598 2018-05-01 18:55:49 @QompassMarkets Qompass a project platform with strong tools for building your ico or issuing crypto and by tokenizing business in general. The project is a bomb. In my opinion, one of the most generous bounty programs.

2608 2018-05-01 18:55:11 Crypto is like Klondike, where beginnings are uncertain & hostory will be written by winners only. In the meantime popcorn.
2609 2018-05-01 18:55:09 There have been no enterprise level, institutional tools available and no mechanisms for sophisticated investors to be able to trade in the same way they do for traditional securities and currencies.

However, Traidia will provide the solution.

2610 2018-05-01 18:54:51 Barrier to entry for the non tech user which holds back mainstream adoption and potentially crypto not becoming an asset class is much worse than all of these.

2643 2018-05-01 18:52:45 1/2 Why has the word "security" become a bad word as it relates to #Crypto ? Security, ie Investment, is good, capitalism is built on this. There should be disclosure, yes, but not the 100's of pages of small print that lawyers put together today, that does nothing

2705 2018-05-01 18:46:50 I always read your Tweets and enjoy your insights. But this one was unnecessary FUD. John ShitcAfee already tried to make FUD on XVG and the XVG team kept working hard and accomplished some big goals. So, let it be. :)
2706 2018-05-01 18:46:50 Great idea! With some generalization e.g if strings.Contains(qs, ";") { http.ServerLog.Errlog(...) }. I tagged @agl__ in that issue for ideas such as what you've proposed, as IIRC he has done surveys of Certificate Transparency logs to help inform decisions for crypto/x509

2786 2018-05-01 18:40:04 Those suits will do anything for a taste of real money. They spend their whole careers licking the boots of their superiors and then feel the only way to move up is to take advantage of others. It is the only way they know how.

2800 2018-05-01 18:38:20 That’s fine, but it’s not okay to encompass all European cultures under “White”. Are Poles ‘White’? Spaniards? Italians? Different answers at different times, hugely arrogant to shoehorn them into one category - just as when they treat Africa as if it’s a country not a continent
2801 2018-05-01 18:38:16 People want to be able to blame someone else when things go bad...AND have a safety net to save them from the consequences of their own decisions. Its unhealthy codependance really. You see it even in crypto...failing govs underfund education & rigged economys depress the people
2802 2018-05-01 18:38:01 Best reply! I brought it at 0.50 but believe me I've fucked up on other trades. Gotta learn somehow right? I think the crypto space needs to stop taking the piss out of top buyers though. It happens.

2805 2018-05-01 18:37:41 What FED wants is undoubtedly electronic retail banking (registered assets), but this direction is mired in AML & fraud management overhead, "real" crypto is a quasi-anonymous bearer asset w/o central control on capital flows, doubtful speculators will be much interested in less.

2817 2018-05-01 18:35:50 1) Great point. Totally agree that crypto as whole is a destructive money printer. But it's guilt-by-association to infer anything about Bitcoin based on this.

2) Greece's problem is cultural decadence. Monetary policy is no cure for that.
2818 2018-05-01 18:35:49 Let's make it clear, if we're talking about common people. Gold for payments where it's illegal or more private, or probably more expensive - ok. But I doubt your neighborhood shop will accept gold. Hence, electronic crypto would be the only choice if we want to avoid fiats.

2883 2018-05-01 18:29:44 I just listened to the unchained podcast, and  @CremeDeLaCrypto literally did *not* say that about @NickSzabo4 at all.
2884 2018-05-01 18:29:41 That's not much of a reason.
Reasons I think it'll go down:
1) Airdrop is Months away
2) Airdrop requires you to HODL
3) Airdrop is truly 1:1 OCN, causing the price to tank
4) Airdrop is of an extremely low value crypto that nobody wants

I hope I'm wrong but if not...

2897 2018-05-01 18:28:02 24 hours since attempting to complete a transfer in my @RevolutApp. My payment is still pending and has not been executed within thier own published timescales. If they can't get the basics right, how can we trust them with our #ripple.....? #XRPCommunity #crypto #unicorn #xrp
2898 2018-05-01 18:27:47 True, but the crypto markets are changing quick. Yes there will always be opportunity but now is the moment to capitalize on this one fully.

2900 2018-05-01 18:27:43 50% in crypto, 50% in fiat right now... if the market goes up i win... if it goes down i win ;-)
2901 2018-05-01 18:27:40 Come to Ohio, Toronto ain't too far, set up shop stack your BitCoin, keep what you have and pay attention. The data is in, the Yeild back on the USD was 1.87% today
2902 2018-05-01 18:27:26 Why withdrawal is pending late 4 days
2903 2018-05-01 18:27:18 Awesome! I’m big into crypto. Love it :)
2904 2018-05-01 18:26:37 Successful people don’t believe in “once in a lifetime opportunities”. There is endless opportunities and abundance in anything they do because they will provide value wherever there talents take them.
2905 2018-05-01 18:26:28 @CryptoMedicated I see that you are committed to enriching the crypto community instead of trying to make a quick buck and I am happy to be a part of your group. Thanks for keeping it 
2906 2018-05-01 18:26:13 But only invest in crypto what you're psychologically ready to lose sooner rather than later. That way, the later can be less harsh.
2907 2018-05-01 18:26:09 It's being recorded... Hard to keep track of all the crypto meetups at the moment. Rootstock also presenting tonight at Coinscrum!
2908 2018-05-01 18:26:08 that is not a bad theory - in open crypto networks, everyone is potentially an adversarial attacker

2930 2018-05-01 18:23:34 That's like every conference in my experience. The ones who care about about crypto tend to avoid crowds
2931 2018-05-01 18:23:28 No. It's technically possible but needs a lot of change on the crypto on top of opendht (and some changes). For now, it's more like PGP for text messages, (you retrieve the public key of your peer) and DTLS for SIP calls.

2934 2018-05-01 18:22:56 I wonder if crypto people are predisposed to distrust other views because they are steeped in a technology built on the principle of mutual mistrust.

2988 2018-05-01 18:18:51 To be fair, it only has ~200 daily active users. That's 200 more than I expected but  still negligible , and that figure is gameable. I think it is safe to assume Craig Grant isn't against inflating that number.

Says a lot about the state of dapps on eth though if 200 DAU=8th.

3044 2018-05-01 18:14:11 Recently crypto has moved in the same direction as traditional risk assets, also.  That may be more of a ST than LT thing and may not hold under super stressful conditions, but recently they’re positively correlated in USD terms

3053 2018-05-01 18:13:38 @NelkFilmz Boiz forget youtube and check out @DTube_Official and @steemit. You have to understand that a decentralised future is a better one.

3123 2018-05-01 18:08:34 You're kidding right? This is crypto. 10% in a day is nothing! It's not uncommon for BTC to drop 25% in a day. If BCH only drops 10% I'd say it's pretty solid!

3204 2018-05-01 18:00:14 I’m VERY optimistic about SBI VC. However, I assume only a small percentage of those 8.52 million will begin trading crypto as a result of this launch. SBI is powerful so I’m more excited for the organic growth they’ll no doubt experience. This is a big deal!
3205 2018-05-01 18:00:09 I don't agree. If not for other technical tradeoffs like dangerously novel crypto, I'd love to see Bitcoin get Zcash style anonymity.

Anyway, banks can easily use Bitcoin in ways that are very anonymous if they choose too.

3275 2018-05-01 17:54:15 The @digiwage team is proud to announce the release of our revised whitepaper! In it, you will find upcoming changes that are currently being worked on. Check it out! #digiwage #wage #freelance #marketplace #crypto #future
3276 2018-05-01 17:54:14 All of us own crypto. But do you have 6 months of living expenses saved in case of tragedy? Be smart. Do it. Make it your goal.
3277 2018-05-01 17:54:06 If you don’t run a full #bitcoin node, you outsource part of your #crypto #security to third parties your wallet is connected to. You are a second class Bicoin user. If you have your #coin at the #exchanges you are 3rd class.
3278 2018-05-01 17:54:01 This is why I like you, not all hopped up on the Twitter Crypto Kool aid!   I absolutely agree with you and I definitely see $10,500 in the cards before they go lower.  Not sure about 11-12 though although that would be a good level to suck in some more $ before heading down.
3279 2018-05-01 17:54:00 Holy hell ... that was amazing!! Lmao lolz
3280 2018-05-01 17:53:48 Also going through the DMs today

So many people with "Crypto" in their name

asking things like "target sir" or "can you chart xxx" or "buy now" "will this go down?"
Do some study to do it yourself, especially if you gonna try to identify like that.
3281 2018-05-01 17:53:36 it's very nice! Or all must give the alot of x tokens for promotions?

November I put in $100 in bat 
Today that was worth $400
6 months.... Investment x4. 
This isn't even amazing in crypto. Coins do much better. Just sharing to remind yall. Don't sell on the first pump or too soon.
3284 2018-05-01 17:53:22 Crypto events need to get their registration game together. @cryptoinvestsmt @AlonGoren literally line around the block since 8:30 am, taking about 5-10 min per person to pick up their tickets after they are individually printed, now they're distributing

3385 2018-05-01 17:43:08 The idea behind @BTF_PROJECT platform is very simple — it’s an easy-to-use tool which will allow small & medium investors to hedge their risks in crypto trading. The company has created its own token, BTF, and intends to provide real value for BTF holders on the secondary market.

3394 2018-05-01 17:42:22 Crypto investors always get into the discussion of accredited investors. This is not a crypto issue this is how the US views securities. It is incorrect to say it equates wealth with intelligence, it equates wealth with ability to shoulder the risk of a loss.

3399 2018-05-01 17:41:20 The nature of Digibyte and crypto means that probably will not happen... VZLA destabilization plan is almost complete and we will have a US backed leader in there soon enough. The point is that people are becoming accepting of it

3424 2018-05-01 17:38:29 I have been in the $crypto game for 5 years now and still make mistakes sometimes while trading. This game is not easy. It requires dedication, focus and a lot of patience combined with risk management. How the fuck are some of the new players acting like $crypto experts?
3425 2018-05-01 17:38:20 Any celebrity that's shotgunning demos with buzzwords is doing market research.

Do you want someone who's truly passionate about crypto or someone that just wants your eyeball servitude?

3473 2018-05-01 17:34:12 I’m not gonna pretend that crypto has done a ton for me, because it really hasn’t.

But what it has done is given me a release and some long term peace of mind.

I even remember saying to you previously, about when looking at ICO's have a look at the MMcrypto teams picks
3486 2018-05-01 17:32:39 I am going to learn you one thing.

You should expect nothing from crypto twitter. People are not here for you, but for themselves.

And you should be grateful for every little thing you learn from crypto twitter and the laughs.

Good to stay stoic and grateful and DYOR.
3487 2018-05-01 17:32:23 Persistence is the key. Money is getting more expensive with rates rising. There’s funding out there if people know where to look and position their business correctly. People need to consider resources in the #crypto community like @ethlend1 @saltlending and more.

3502 2018-05-01 17:31:15 @AltOne_Crypto Good call on the ADA
3503 2018-05-01 17:31:10 cryptoを通して日本のお金がどれほど流れ出してるか。投資してるつもりになってるけど。
3504 2018-05-01 17:31:08 me too i want to give crypto testimony cos what’s all this?
3505 2018-05-01 17:31:00 Nice man! What model is the car?
3506 2018-05-01 17:30:55 Good. Who wants crypto fascists on a workers' march?
3507 2018-05-01 17:30:30 In this system nothing lasts forever and companies come and go all the time. Even Fluffy tells people not to invest in Monero so yes, nothing is stable in this crypto game. Some people are loosing million's gambling on it and others are winning big time.

3519 2018-05-01 17:29:40 Unless you are a dev, how else can anyone be “in” crypto without spending money? Wall st (mostly )doesn’t invest because they believe x or y company. They want money

3542 2018-05-01 17:28:06 CBs have done lots of damage but the bulk was done by greedy market makers that ruined traders between 1998 and 2011 mainly. Fake gurus and simplistic TA had their share too. You cannot have speculation without speculators. Whatever was left moved to #crypto to get ruined.
3543 2018-05-01 17:28:01 crypto only
3544 2018-05-01 17:27:57 Standard 
3545 2018-05-01 17:27:54 You are called THE CRYPTO MAN ... guess you can find this Information yourself  Respect @360_trader he is the best 
3546 2018-05-01 17:27:54 Long time for me is 5 years min in real estate then those crypto market are pretty fast for me.
