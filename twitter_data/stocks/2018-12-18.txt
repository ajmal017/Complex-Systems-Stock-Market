7 2018-12-18 23:58:45 Oh I thought it was regarding actual firearms. Honestly, bump stocks are just a way to make a semi-auto a full auto, which are essentially banned for most part. Even those of us in firearm field concede to this. Turn in though is over reach
8 2018-12-18 23:58:42 I wonder how many “take it from my cold dead hands” guys give up their bump stocks without a fight?
9 2018-12-18 23:58:41 Apparently he doesn't realize how easy it is for people to alter guns without  buying bump stocks. Either way, I dont think anything should be outlawed. If the government has them then so should it's Citizens. How else are we to protect ourselves from them?

13 2018-12-18 23:57:47 I think bump stocks are ridiculous and potentially unsafe on the range, I'm ok regulating them as a NFA item over a ban

But if they pass this ban, they need to reimburse owners. They owned a legal product.

Also just FYI you can bump fire with just a finger

41 2018-12-18 23:56:48 They wouldn't just steady themselves,  they'd bounce back and rally. Stocks & Stirling will rise. All the market wants is certainty and stability. As soon as we leave the EU, with confirmation of what that looks like, everything will rise.
42 2018-12-18 23:56:43 Very sad to hear that the 2A was attacked today.  Bump stocks were legal, people paid, now they are not legal and the government says destroy them or turn them in and get zero.  A sad day for America, first promise broken.
43 2018-12-18 23:56:30 @realDonaldTrump Your move to ban bump stocks was a bad move.SHAMEFUL !!!!!
44 2018-12-18 23:56:13 Trump banned bump stocks. They must be destroyed or turned in to the ATF.
45 2018-12-18 23:56:10 I wish every post would start out by reminding people that Democrat President Obama made bump stocks legal.
46 2018-12-18 23:56:00 Reminder NRA didn't help the American people from stopping D. TRUMP from banning bump stocks. #PissedConservative
47 2018-12-18 23:55:57 More half truths from you and fake news!! They’re not fighting banning bump stocks, they’re fighting the confiscation of ones that are in existence. The confiscation of anyone’s property is a violation of the fourth amendment.
48 2018-12-18 23:55:37 I wonder if Trump understands bump stocks are not investments sold on stock exchanges. They're a device that turns semi-automatic rifles into machine guns.
49 2018-12-18 23:55:22 These are the people I run into most, but they’re usually pretty bad.

One Pikachu kept doing smash attacks and would teabag every time one landed. He then lost by three stocks. /shrug
50 2018-12-18 23:55:09 Go for dividend stocks now market is tanking
51 2018-12-18 23:55:04 The democrats haven't taken the house you utter spoon. As a matter of fact the stocks stopped growing since your beloved president did the tax cuts. Coincidence? i think not
52 2018-12-18 23:54:37 Smash U is the only game where I hate the intended player base.
I hate getting two games in tourney reg settings and then suddenly a match with 6 timer point no stocks and items on high. Lemme play this children's party game in a competitive environment fam.
53 2018-12-18 23:54:29 The Trump administration just banned bump stocks for firearms. That is ironic as fuck.
54 2018-12-18 23:54:27 Continually striving to pick bottom(s) on stocks without an exit plan can get you into trouble fast. i.e. $GBTC
55 2018-12-18 23:54:24 best thing i did this year was invest in small stocks
56 2018-12-18 23:54:22 The president just turned a couple of hundred thousand supporters into criminals today Banning bump stocks
57 2018-12-18 23:54:22 I've hunted since Iwas10. We don't need bump stocks for hunting & they're not good for target shooting..
58 2018-12-18 23:54:19 I seem to remember the Vegas shooter had bump stocks. Obviously, many liberals have access to guns.  They commit the majority of mass shootings.  I'm not sure of the point of this thread but the best gun control is the reintroduction of mental health care facilities.
59 2018-12-18 23:53:28 I agree with you gentlemen bump stocks are weapons of war
60 2018-12-18 23:53:17 You were also told Mexico was going to pay for it and you’re not getting that either! It says something when you’re fine with bump stocks but not with people seeking asylum
61 2018-12-18 23:53:07 58 people were killed, 422 more people were shot, so 480 total. Please pardon my  gross over estimation. 429 were hurt in the stampede so not the majority.  

He had the ammo and the vantage point. You really think the bump stocks didn't increase the number of rounds he fired?
62 2018-12-18 23:53:05 I know. I agree with all that. I'm just not going to be upset about bump stocks right now. I think we need to stay focused on more important like the AR ban or mag capacity. Which I'm sure they want, but all they got was bump stocks.
63 2018-12-18 23:53:01 exactly Owen and I read in the economic press that UK stocks are almost at the point of being uninvestable, a no deal brexit plan should hurry that status along.
64 2018-12-18 23:53:00 T-90: Destroy your bump stocks #GunControlNow #MarchForOurLives
65 2018-12-18 23:53:00 Cup and handle formation applies to high revenue s&p  stocks. Requires usually six months to form...Regardless out of the 5 this is the one to own at this stage in the story. It’s got the most up trend ahead of it for a multitude of reasons.
66 2018-12-18 23:52:55 Because Diane and her anti gunner ilk couldn’t keep it just to bump stocks. It was filled with all sort of anti 2a language that had zero to do with bump stocks.  It’s her fault they are still available
67 2018-12-18 23:52:44 @realDonaldTrump 
"#Trump supporters yesterday: “Ban bump stocks? How dare you infringe on my 2nd Amendment  rights!”

Trump supporters today: “I don’t use a bump stock anyways. #MAGA!”

#2A #Hypocrites
68 2018-12-18 23:52:32 So the president decides to ban bump stocks and make criminals out of a couple hundred thousand used to be supporters
69 2018-12-18 23:52:17 Great point Chris! Also please talk about the ban on Bump Stocks cause it's hardly being talked about...would be a perfect tweet for @realDonaldTrump to be putting out there but crickets is it because he doesn't want to get his base pist or the NRA mad?
70 2018-12-18 23:52:16 Ohhh... worth it ang dalawwaaaa. So gora na! Ubos na stocks sa sml tho haha sabi nila wed pa pero not sure din. Abree ako nagclaim 
71 2018-12-18 23:51:59 The new ATF regulations would arbitrarily redefine bump stocks as ‘machineguns’ -
72 2018-12-18 23:51:52 Bump stocks are pointless. Here's the thing though, bump stocks do NOT turn semi-automatic into automatic firearms magically. That requires a different receiver. Its still one shot with each pull of the trigger with or without one of these.
73 2018-12-18 23:51:49 LAS VEGAS WILLL NEVER GET OVER THIS STORY WITH 58 DEAD AND SO MANY INJURED FROM THE BUMP STOCKS GUNS.  THIS MUST BE DONE AWAY WITH,  IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS PART OF A GUN,  GET RID OF THEM.
74 2018-12-18 23:51:48 Thank you for banning bump stocks.  I wish you’d vet your staff better. Your natl sec advisor plead guilty to “selling out” our nation & @SHSanders45 defended his treasonous acts.
75 2018-12-18 23:51:40 @ATFHQ Did you do all your BSTD testing with an Akins Accelerator? Because bump stocks do not push the rifle forward; the shooter has to do that manually.
@AWRHawkins @TheGunFeed @2AFDN @gunpolicy
76 2018-12-18 23:51:37 Thank you Senator Feinstein. For any opposing this, I would ask you on what basis. The second amendment has nothing at all to say about bump stocks. Not a single word.
77 2018-12-18 23:51:12 It would be passed if you would just limit itvto bump stocks but you anti gunners fill it with nonsense language that goes way beyond bump stocks.  You are to blame for bump stocks still in the market ...
78 2018-12-18 23:51:11 sabi ko nga limited stocks nalang ihhh!!
79 2018-12-18 23:50:57 @LesterHoltNBC  bump stocks do not “Amp Up the firing power” of certain firearms as you claimed tonight on @NBCNightlyNews
80 2018-12-18 23:50:24 Worst December since the Great Depression.

Worst entire year since 2008.

No tweets about stocks from @realDonaldTrump lately 
81 2018-12-18 23:49:58 Many gold stocks extended on the daily while $SPX $COMPQ and many other ETFS I follow are oversold on the daily. Tomorrow this could reverse after the FED.  Money could flow out of gold stocks into oversold names.
If the FED does not deliver then gold miners are heading way up.
82 2018-12-18 23:49:52 Do you need to surrender your bump stocks through a FFL dealer or will the Feds come to you?
83 2018-12-18 23:49:19 Thank you for banning bump stocks.
84 2018-12-18 23:49:05 @chiappafirearms Are there any stocks for the Model 92 chambered in 9mm flobert besides the wooden stock it comes with?
85 2018-12-18 23:48:49 Just recently heard you banned bump stocks. Although I rarely agree with anything from this  administration...if this genuinely is the case...thank you.
86 2018-12-18 23:48:47 I don't know what we got. But, I'm sure they wanted every thing taken from us and all they got was bump stocks. I don't know. I just know I'm going to be upset about bump stocks.
87 2018-12-18 23:48:39 Yes you can.
People have done so before bump stocks were a thing.
Use your thumb.
88 2018-12-18 23:48:23 But at least you did ban bump stocks
89 2018-12-18 23:48:22 Stocks offer you annual dividends and voting rights.
Bitcoin offers you chad altcoin pumps.
90 2018-12-18 23:48:03 #ASX200 is pushing up this morning & we see a good opportunity to trade short in the afternoon.Looking for price to break through 5,588 & then 5,603, if this occurs we expect a peak of 5,645 which is our target to enter a short trade

91 2018-12-18 23:47:53 To bad stocks have fell badly and it will keep falling because of Corporate Student Consumer Government Debt. Bond yields inverted, the FED is insolvent might take until July but the Collapse is imminent
92 2018-12-18 23:47:41 President Trump moves to ban bump stocks: DON'T KNOW WHY ? THAT AIN'T GONNA STOP SOME NATIONAL or INTERNATIONAL HERO FROM GUNNIN' HIS CROOKED AZZ DOWN !!
93 2018-12-18 23:47:05 What happened to your actions to outlaw bump stocks until the NRA told you to back off?
94 2018-12-18 23:47:03 @jimcramer @CNBC  yesterday stocks were recovering until Gundlach spoke, today recovery until Mnuchin spoke. Maybe we just need a day of people shutting up?
95 2018-12-18 23:46:58 Options:, Comey, US stocks erased sharply yesterday... as the last Federal Reserve meetings for the year will be today and tmrw... dropped 600 points... * with trade war... S&P 500: Nasdaq: negative territory for 1st time since 2015... Russell 2000: bear
96 2018-12-18 23:46:52 Trump just banned bump stocks nationwide but the news doesn’t say much. If that was Barry Hussein Obama the Fake news would be praising him.. I hope CNN dies it’s on a steady decline so that’s good. Lower ratings than fox
97 2018-12-18 23:46:49 Not a fan of individual one but a positive step today, banning bump stocks.
98 2018-12-18 23:46:44 .@whitehouse @realdonladtrump I stand with @GunOwners in opposition to so-called "red flag" gun grab laws. These laws shred the Second and Fifth Amendments. Please oppose these proposals in all forms! #2A.  I will not vote for you again if you steal Bump stocks from citizens
99 2018-12-18 23:46:42 Today the 2A took another blow, this time the DOJ had made legal the bump stocks, now they say it is now illegal and demand to confiscate with no reimbursement.  I don't own one, but those who do should be reimbursed.
100 2018-12-18 23:46:25 Thank you @realDonaldTrump for the ban of bump stocks!
Just tell the NRA to sit down.
101 2018-12-18 23:46:14 Bump stocks don't "turn" guns into "machine guns, you dope! You never heard of arthritis or something?! Especially seniors. How about young women who live in the wilderness by themselves, being threatened by would be rapists? You Liberals must think ist "noble" to be victims!
102 2018-12-18 23:46:14 Rent checks -> stocks ->stock dividends -> crypto currency
103 2018-12-18 23:45:45 Not once this year have I bought #cryptocurrency or #stocks and actually made money at this point.
104 2018-12-18 23:45:24 I'm not a Trump supporter by ANY means but he just banned bump stocks so.. that's a step in the right direction. Now if he can stop trying to build the wall and instead make it easier for immigrants to get citizenship with thorough background checks and screening.
105 2018-12-18 23:45:05 Bump stocks. I‘m an optimist not an idiot
106 2018-12-18 23:44:23 COLONIAL CORPORATION stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
107 2018-12-18 23:44:19 $4.05 billion - Stocks are still monetary assets that could have been sold to others for hard cash.
108 2018-12-18 23:44:10 Big set back for the NRA.  BUMP STOCKS BANNED.  Boo f’n who. @NRA @NRATV
109 2018-12-18 23:44:08 “Hello Ladies & Gents, we have a great Xmas Sale 
on at the moment, 50% off!! For Enquiry call/whatsapp 08108688293   whilst
stocks last”
110 2018-12-18 23:44:06 Bump stocks are ridiculous. I prefer to aim, myself.   However, it’s the legal precedent that is worrisome. Of course, if a constitutional challenge is lost....more bad laws happen.
111 2018-12-18 23:43:59 There are few crypto stocks left most have moved on. Mining is bs what else do they do as a stock doing crypto ? Disagree most crypto’s are dead cat bounces .
112 2018-12-18 23:43:37 Trust me I know  the difference is mandatory give backs is the beginning of a police state, watch it doesn't seem like much now but no grandfathered bump stocks only mean people will end up getting raided they think it's unconstitutional, there's alot of blood with force...
113 2018-12-18 23:43:33 Average peak for stocks is 14 months before recession so we need to look at 2Q19.
114 2018-12-18 23:43:29 “Not needed” you say? You don’t “need” a car or electricity either but they are a modern convenance that are nice to have. Bump stocks are impractical but if you knew about Fed law, the ATF has no power to ban a gun accessory. It does not change the function of the rifle. #GOA
115 2018-12-18 23:43:20 As a levergun guy, I'm not even sure how bump stocks work and have no interest in owning one. However, those who do, do NOT give them up. Nor give up your high capacity magazines if you live in the Fascist state of New Joysey.
116 2018-12-18 23:42:57 So I don’t tweet, like ever, but I just walked through as the news was playing and heard that “the trump administration has banned bump stocks such as those used in the Las Vegas shooting. Owners must destroy or turnover theirs.” 

I’m actually proud of my government for once wow
117 2018-12-18 23:42:53 @realDonaldTrump If EVER there was a major setup to destroy a business,  the VEGAS SHOOTING fully intended to kill BUMP STOCKS. 
What a major ruse on American rights!
STILL, THE TRUTH NOT TOLD.
118 2018-12-18 23:42:46 You’ve misunderstood my comment.
It’s not that brace grips would go into the Tax Stamp territory , but in exchange for bump stocks relax the SBR regs and let people use them with regular stocks and if you need to use a brace stock ..go ahead.
Just say’n 
119 2018-12-18 23:42:40 Watch as a scared individual-1 gets some shit done!! Bump stocks banned!!!
120 2018-12-18 23:42:33 Of course, the Dems will want to add extra things to be banned. But we all agree that the bump stocks should be banned.
121 2018-12-18 23:42:23 Dude like 3 months ago you were telling us to buy $SQ in the $80’s and now AFTER many stocks are already down 30%+ you’re a raging bear. Seriously WTF?
122 2018-12-18 23:42:11 Hey #MAGA , looks like your orange hero is taking away your bump-stocks. And to think you thought it was Obama coming for your guns.  checkmate.
123 2018-12-18 23:42:03 Gotta say I disagree with trump on this one I'm usually an avid supporter however I'm not feelin it today caving on the border wall and banning bump stocks...we elected you cuz you did what you wanted and didn't care what people thought
124 2018-12-18 23:42:00 Coworker who just started to invest into stocks mentioned he heard analysts talking about stocks going down, and how it could go down further. I asked him what he thought. He said it's probably going down. I asked him if he would buy stocks. He said no.
125 2018-12-18 23:41:43 Trump bans bump stocks. When the Illinois Democratic Legislators wouldn’t even do that much.
126 2018-12-18 23:41:41 Get yer bump stocks now!
127 2018-12-18 23:41:16 Donald Trump officially put a ban on bump stocks and I think that’s the most progress he’s made since he was elected
128 2018-12-18 23:41:08 #Trump says: “I - and I alone - banned bump stocks.”
129 2018-12-18 23:41:06 I believe DJT wants the bump stocks banned and brought this up before. If you guys can't pass this, you are useless. And stop trying to take credit for what DJT recommended.
130 2018-12-18 23:41:02 The other thing is $BTC just broke through resistance so I’m expecting more upside from it from a technical point of view. I probably should’ve mentioned that too lol. I expect stocks to fall more. And if I’m correct on a btc reversal then the correlation will continue to weaken
131 2018-12-18 23:40:54 Good luck trying to get everyone to hand in their bump stocks 
132 2018-12-18 23:40:49 As a gun rights advocate, don't care for bump stocks. I'm not sure banning them will fix the problem though.
133 2018-12-18 23:40:43 It took 14 months, (after the Last Vegas massacre), to outlaw Bump Stocks? It was done by a Presidential action? Why wasn't it done the day after?
134 2018-12-18 23:40:21 @NRA the worst day for your organization. On the day bump stocks are banned(which y’all gave the green light to ATF) You call begging for money and memberships. Go pound sand!
135 2018-12-18 23:40:13 Thank you @POTUS for allowing the ban of bump stocks to become a reality. There is no social necessity for such a tool, none. If you can’t defend yourself without one, you certainly shouldn’t be trusted with one.
136 2018-12-18 23:40:10 Bump stocks are gone. I guess even a blind squirrel is right twice a day. May be the first time I can unironically agree with the Trunp administration.
137 2018-12-18 23:40:09 Really bump-stocks? Lol
138 2018-12-18 23:40:05 i can't believe it took president trump to ban bump stocks. jfc.
139 2018-12-18 23:39:58 You talking about bump stocks
140 2018-12-18 23:39:22 @erichmpratt This is so simple. If you have a concealed carry permit that should extend to other things like bump stocks. If you’re law-abiding citizen to carry a weapon concealed you should be able to carry whatever you want.
141 2018-12-18 23:39:16 It’s a little too late. The people who want bump stocks already have them
142 2018-12-18 23:39:16 .@foxnews #maga @breitbartnews. Trump has come for your bump stocks.   Good
143 2018-12-18 23:39:11 Looks like it’s about that time to get back into the stocks
144 2018-12-18 23:39:11 Tough day to SNAG A HEADLINE banning bump stocks!!!! @realDonaldTrump @Lenny0connor AHAHAHAHA
145 2018-12-18 23:39:05 Two, evaluating bump stocks by their use in hunting and target practice is ludicrous. That’s not what they were invented or designed for.
146 2018-12-18 23:39:02 Banning bump stocks should have been done 10 months ago when the Parkland shootings happened. You will do anything to distract what is going on.
147 2018-12-18 23:38:41 @realDonaldTrump why did you infringed our second amendment by banning bump stocks??? Bad mistake!!
148 2018-12-18 23:38:33 thx @econguyrosie If they sit on their hands and stocks tank, time to get really worried. #BakesTakes_
149 2018-12-18 23:38:28 Obama never took your guns, but Trump just took your bump stocks. Winning.
150 2018-12-18 23:38:26 Kudos to the Trump Administration for following through on their promise to ban bump stocks
151 2018-12-18 23:38:19 Stocks bearish... $crypto bullish.
152 2018-12-18 23:38:18 They do not model for current position in the boom bust cycle, while s&p is only down 5% on the year, Front end cyclicals are down 30+ percent and defensive late cycle stocks are in up showing how late we are in the cycle. Let alone the engineering that was done
153 2018-12-18 23:38:18 What % of a balanced portfolio should #Bitcoin & #Crypto assets make up?
#Stocks #Bonds #Property #Investing #GetOffZero
154 2018-12-18 23:37:40 More than 365 days later after #LasVegasShooting, where 58 people died & hundreds were injured, Pres Trump + his Admin have FINALLY decided to issue a new rule that would ban bump stocks.

While I applaud this decision, more needs to be done to combat gun violence in our country!
155 2018-12-18 23:37:40 I just don’t see how this is any different from investing in stocks? Buy low and hold? I’m trying to understand why peeps are buying crypto when there’s virtually no utility right now.
156 2018-12-18 23:37:25 @realDonaldTrump are you an undercover Democrap. Now taking aim at the second amendment. Start with bump stocks end with marshal law and feds coming to take our guns so we can be ruled by our communist politicians.
157 2018-12-18 23:37:22 You de talk like you de trade in thema stocks. siA
158 2018-12-18 23:37:20 if you pick 3 stocks 3 minutes I'm going to take your first stock then run away until time out
159 2018-12-18 23:36:54 @BretBaier Bump stocks are a waste of money.  I use my belt loop achieve the same effect.  #SpecialReport #FoxNews
160 2018-12-18 23:36:53 dude all we're saying is banning bump stocks is stupid because you can literally bump shoot with your finger or make one in 5 seconds, and you're straw manning by saying lets make murder legal by that logic. The logic doesn't apply to things not associated with bump stocks
161 2018-12-18 23:36:49 Bump stocks are crap. Lead unloads in random directions down range putting ground hogs and flying pigeons in simultaneous danger.
162 2018-12-18 23:36:47 $FDX $UPS Everyone knows these are good seasonal stocks, right? Just when you think you know the market. Careful thinking you can know.
163 2018-12-18 23:36:33 Banning bump stocks was a feel good moment for the dems who wanted to act like they’ve actually accomplished something. I’m pretty sure come January you’ll need the majority of the senate(GOP) & the President to sign any bill so good luck with that.
164 2018-12-18 23:36:02 @zionoil I bought 166 shares of ZN stocks all in hopes of my own future gains. Is this possible?
165 2018-12-18 23:35:54 Trump should do a buy back program on the bump stocks. 

Australia did it. It should work here too.
166 2018-12-18 23:35:44 President Trump has taken the correct action by banning bump stocks, which allow the semi-automatic gun user to fire a stream of bullets with one single pull of the trigger.  Could more be done?  Of course.  But I want to remind Americans that as long as the second amendment...
167 2018-12-18 23:35:39 But I haven't heard one person bitch about the bump stocks lol
168 2018-12-18 23:35:11 Isnt like saying stocks suck just buy the Dow?
169 2018-12-18 23:35:03 Trump administration bans bump stocks. BUT HILLARY!
170 2018-12-18 23:35:01 You're definition of triggered is a little off. I don't feel upset or angry and my comments were neither.

Just trying, and failing, to have an honest conversation about the practical use of bump stocks and why gun owners (to use your term) are triggered over their banning 
171 2018-12-18 23:34:49 Bump stocks aren’t the problem. The pharmaceutical companies that have mass marketed SSRI’s and SNRI’s as the cure all are the problem. Why can’t we have the infomation about how many suicides, murders, and mass murders have been committed while one these drugs. Wake up!
172 2018-12-18 23:34:47 So bump stocks are considered machine guns now and this is “common sense” gun laws. What’s next, scopes are considered bombs? Common sense is not so common
173 2018-12-18 23:34:46 Trump admin announced ban on Bump Stocks today, but you won’t report anything positive, will you?
174 2018-12-18 23:34:33 So now only criminals will have bump stocks, while politicians can crow that they addressed a problem.
175 2018-12-18 23:34:25 Trump administration officially bans bump stocks:DA CHICKEN SHIT 5 TIME DRAFT DODGER IS SCARED SHITLESS SOMEONE IS GONNA GUN HIM DOWN EVEN WITH HIM WEARING HIS BULLETPROOF VEST !! IF I WAS AS CROOKED AS HIM, I'D BE WORRIED  ABOUT BUMP STOCKS TOO !! RATTA-TAT-TAT, RATTA-TAT-TAT !!
176 2018-12-18 23:34:15 Not a trump supporter but thank god this administration finally did something good! Goodbye bump stocks!!!
177 2018-12-18 23:34:15 Dude seriously why do u need bump stocks. Why? What's the use of them I'm curious?
178 2018-12-18 23:34:09 Why didn’t Obama ban bump stocks? Asking fr
179 2018-12-18 23:33:57 Experienced gun owners, weapon handlers and veterans are just dying laughing at this. Bump stocks are so stupid and they are literally pointless. Like this is doing nothing lol. I’ve never even seen one either
180 2018-12-18 23:33:51 Yes, agreed, but what can b done about the bump stocks that are already out there. CA banded high capacity magazines, how many do u think were turned in to state officials? How many people charged w possession, after the fact? It's a great start, but it doesn't solve the problem.
181 2018-12-18 23:33:44 Trump admin announced ban on Bump Stocks today, but you won’t report anything positive, will you?
182 2018-12-18 23:33:31 Obama approved bump stocks/Trump is making them illegal/go Trump!
183 2018-12-18 23:32:59 They still REALLY think that banning bump stocks gone stop all these mass shooting (terrorist attacks here in the USA they just dont wanna say it) dont they? What about the ones that had regular handgunscant put bumpstocks on those
184 2018-12-18 23:32:57 Yes Ma'am. Stocks, ETFs, Indices, commodities, currencies, and crypto. :)
185 2018-12-18 23:32:43 No school children were killed with bump stocks, and in fact I haven’t seen any reports of what weapons actually killed the folks in Vegas... #WhatHappensInVegas
186 2018-12-18 23:32:41 Because it’s a slippery slope. Bump stocks are stupid and no one uses them.  It’s the principle.
187 2018-12-18 23:32:37 Ttag had an article after Las Vegas that basically boiled down to, bump stocks are indefensible but they must be defended because a ban is a slippery slope to confiscation and therefore Tyranny
188 2018-12-18 23:32:34 @LogCabinGOP to you loggers Trump just banned bump stocks! GOP is moving in to take your guns while you cheer for them. Obama never infringed on a sane persons gun rights! He passed two laws that actually expanded gun rights. You all are an easy sale.
189 2018-12-18 23:32:28 In that case......a 3some and stocks & bonds.
190 2018-12-18 23:32:03 Brace yourselves....the 'I'm a gun owner but think bump stocks are evil' tweets are coming
191 2018-12-18 23:32:01 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, banning bump stocks is not putting #AmericaFirst our #SecondAmendment right is a natural right that we have as a result of our humanity. Banning #BumpStocks is not only illegal but an act not in America’s best interest.
192 2018-12-18 23:31:41 Stocks and shares? Pensions? ETFs?
193 2018-12-18 23:31:11 More than a few days. But at the same time stocks hit a massive low yesterday. And BTC was up 8%. So that’s a pretty extreme difference given stocks were at a yearly low
194 2018-12-18 23:31:09 Rob, do you use a liquidity filter on the stocks you scan for your CBI reading? Or is it based on the constituents of a stock index?

Thanks
195 2018-12-18 23:31:08 When you think stocks are attractive, you buy them.

Now stocks are not expensive although not cheap.
196 2018-12-18 23:30:36 Huh? and say what
anyone look at the US economic picture lately- obviously bullying the global marketplace is not good for stocks or US workers
197 2018-12-18 23:30:28 I know they don't do what video games portray them as haha. I never saw that it was a compromise. I think bump stocks are a useless gimmick that people shouldn't really care if they are banned. There should be monetary compensation at the least
198 2018-12-18 23:30:17 I find it funny that the Las Vegas shooter situation was never fully closed and publicized...and now the "Great Republican Savior" is now banning bump stocks.
199 2018-12-18 23:30:10 If you see stocks as blips on a ticker tape, you will be led astray. But if you regard stocks as fractional interests in businesses, you will maintain proper perspective. -- Seth Klarman
200 2018-12-18 23:29:42 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close flat giving up early gains ahead of Fed rate meeting.
201 2018-12-18 23:29:30 Bump stocks alter the intention of the original product. You can always bear arms. That will never go away, no mater who's crying about it.
202 2018-12-18 23:29:26 Liberals: Hey, let's have a conversation about bump stocks
Conservatives: GET UR LIBTARD HANDS OFF MY GUNS, 2A RAWR

White House: Ok we're banning bump stocks now.
Conservatives: Oh, that seems reasonable
203 2018-12-18 23:29:23 If you’re “not hearing”, maybe you should try “listening”. BTW, did you hear about Trump banning bump-stocks? It’s true. It’s happening. A broken clock can be right twice a day.
204 2018-12-18 23:29:15 
Trump is taking their bump stocks. This is karmic gold!
205 2018-12-18 23:28:43 Easy solution: Restrict easy access to guns, mandatory 14-day waiting periods & comprehensive background checks, no sales under 21, close gun show loopholes, ban bump stocks & high capacity magazines, mandatory training, license & liability insurance.
206 2018-12-18 23:28:36 Ban military grade weapons from citizens,, ban bump stocks and deeper background checks.
207 2018-12-18 23:28:35 Hola María José. Como Rey Melchor que fui te tengo que decir que no entiendo tu comentario. Los stocks están mejor que nunca, el Ministro se ha reunido con el sector y las ONG para explicarnos la situación, los planteamientos que está haciendo son muy razonables. Saludos. Javier
208 2018-12-18 23:28:32 Well at least @realDonaldTrump you banned bump stocks! I’m a Democrat, so this takes a lot
209 2018-12-18 23:28:29 @DLoesch Dana does the DOJ have a registry for bump stocks
210 2018-12-18 23:28:26 Thx bro!
211 2018-12-18 23:28:26 "U.S. stocks having their worst December since Great Depression." Incredible for sure.  But then when the stock market is doing well, Trump takes the credit.  When it's tanking, it's someone else's fault. Usual cowardly modus operandi from the country's "leader."
212 2018-12-18 23:28:26 I believe that only God can giveth or taketh away bump stocks.
213 2018-12-18 23:28:12 Nope. It’s all tech stocks though. I sold my other stocks in other sectors earlier this year to cash in
214 2018-12-18 23:28:10 Have you seen what’s happening with stocks. Losing all kinds of value in our 401ks thanks to the instability you have created.
215 2018-12-18 23:27:53 Bye bye legal bump stocks. Suck on this, @nra 
216 2018-12-18 23:27:50 Right! We need do nothing more then look at the ban on cocaine to see how successful this ban on bump stocks will be... 
217 2018-12-18 23:27:48 Like I said. With all the mass shootings at some point you have to give them something. Better to give them something as dumbass as bump stocks. That is called winning a negotiation.
218 2018-12-18 23:27:35 fyi: bump stocks make GREAT stocking stuffers
219 2018-12-18 23:27:11 I don't follow anyone that offers no value of thought or substance, knowingly. To do so would be an exercise in stupidity in my humble opinion.. I'll pause while you do the math....

To the issue of bump stocks and weapons. I'm certain they were Ninjas that came in and stole mine
220 2018-12-18 23:27:06 they are not, thay have stocks and selling out of books
221 2018-12-18 23:26:43 PENNY STOCKS???? laughing out loud
222 2018-12-18 23:26:33 Il y a les stocks mais la logistique pour un tel colis (15kg) ça demande un très gros investissement de plus la période est mal choisie donc ça avance petit à petit, c'est pareil pour tout le monde. (les premiers d'abord)
223 2018-12-18 23:26:29 The money in my stocks have dropped alot. Just so you know, a lot of the market specialists basically say the reason the stocks are dropping is because of you.

I have lost, at min, about 30% of the value of my investments. 

Explain how that is when you are all about stocks?
224 2018-12-18 23:26:27 Have we forgotten the Vegas shooting that quickly?  Bump stocks are not a constitutional right.
225 2018-12-18 23:26:07 Your so inconsistent i cant. You just said great time to buy growth stocks. I like your option flow but It feels like your just reacting to ST sentiment like everyone else.
226 2018-12-18 23:25:17 You don't usually good things. Very happy to see bump stocks gone. Good job
227 2018-12-18 23:25:15 IMO invest as much as you can into a Roth IRA and make sure a good chunks is specifically invested in index funds. Proven to be very reliable long term and you’ll want that money when you retire. Obviously a balanced portfolio with stocks is also good if you can do both
228 2018-12-18 23:25:09 So I'll ask again. When Trump comes to take your bump stocks, will you be shooting back?  Government tyranny you know.  You won't answer.
229 2018-12-18 23:25:06 The day after Parkland, which was the result of a jailbreak initiative keeping killer out of jail,Senate Judiciary passed the first leg of jailbreak, which, back then, reduced sentencing for gun felons. Today, as the vote on early release for gun fellons, Trump bans bump stocks
230 2018-12-18 23:24:47 “Congress needs to close those loopholes so that all legislators are forced to at a minimum put their investments in blind trusts or better yet be required to hold only broad-based mutual funds rather than individual stocks.”  Because they self deal like trump. 
231 2018-12-18 23:24:45 Glad they are banning bump stocks no need for that shit
232 2018-12-18 23:24:41 And I say we stop militarizing disputes, work together to stop exploiting fossil fuels, reduce global fishing and let stocks recover, rather than exacerbate every tension and force the US military into others' affairs. 

But that's just me. 

Carry on with your bad self. 

Peace.
233 2018-12-18 23:23:52 I mean if you want to talk about buying a car vs investing, don’t even buy the tesla, just invest in stocks and S&P500.
That’s not the question here, it’s having the car cost 5k less or supercharger4life. You can also loss the 5k in the market or in Vegas, or get 100x and make $$
234 2018-12-18 23:23:42 Bump stocks are range toys. There is hardly much more control than any of a half dozen other ways to bumpfire a semi auto.
235 2018-12-18 23:23:20 Private = Business = making money by providing goods and services.  All this means you are F’ed when the shareholders can earn an extra 1% in their stocks by eliminating those with gasp, pre-existing conditions.
236 2018-12-18 23:23:03 I am glad they are putting a ban on bump stocks. It will give a preview on the failure a gun ban would be. Remember prohibition? The biggest violators were politicians. Ban guns and no one is going to change.
237 2018-12-18 23:22:33 Yup. Sectors like Healthcare, Basic Materials, and Financials were taking a beating this morning. FAANG stocks did well though
238 2018-12-18 23:22:23 There are no checks at Virginia gun shows. I can buy guns straight from people at tables. As god intended. Trump banning bump stocks is a slap to the gun owners that voted for him.
239 2018-12-18 23:22:11 I do have to say tho, he banned bump stocks - probably cause he’s freaking out over the republican base starting to catch on to his bs- and needs us dems now
240 2018-12-18 23:21:49 In the words of deep throat "follow the money".  How many folks in the media own oil stocks.
241 2018-12-18 23:21:43 $TGT and $NVDA  , $GS, $BABA $BIDU, $JD...... those stocks are dead Even  buy back program. I don't think they are good to have.
242 2018-12-18 23:21:16 People can ascribe Mueller/Flynn etc etc to "It's just Washington" but when their stocks decline 10%+ and interest rates on mortgages etc climb they take a less sanguine attitude. The reserve bank is spooning a bitter medicine but there's a year to recover before voters lock in
243 2018-12-18 23:21:15 What's unusual about the new rule is that it's not just a ban on future sales or a forced registration process. Bump stocks now must be surrendered or destroyed. Are they completely useless? Mostly. But I don't like the precedent.
244 2018-12-18 23:21:03 Too bad farmers won’t be buying stocks with that money.
245 2018-12-18 23:20:38 Bump stocks played zero roll in the Vegas shooting
246 2018-12-18 23:20:28 yup, congrats is losing #2A supporters over silly bump stocks.
247 2018-12-18 23:20:28 Can you explain how Obama legalized bump stocks?
248 2018-12-18 23:20:23 Then do more about guns... I am not against guns, but do we need fully auto or even semi in public hands?  Bump Stocks were a start, now keep it going...
249 2018-12-18 23:19:43 I bet those bump stocks caused his rifles to jam. How else to explain the number killed verses the massive number of targets?
250 2018-12-18 23:19:12 I guess we're all just lucky that the Red Coats didn't have bump stocks early in 1775.
251 2018-12-18 23:18:50 Well well, institutional traders sold high didn’t they!   Novice investors chase after market highs.  Don’t worry go ahead and sell lower lows and you can buy back after market makers set new highs next year.   I sold my stocks in October. I’m waiting to buy back cheaper. MAGA
252 2018-12-18 23:18:46 President Trump has now banned bump stocks because he believes that bump stocks make semi automatic rifles into "machine guns". No they don't, it's called trigger discipline. What a bump stock basically does is it absorbs more recoil. #OneTermTrump
253 2018-12-18 23:18:14 They are just damn bump stocks, anybody that knows what the hell they are doing don't mess with those damn things anyways.
254 2018-12-18 23:18:10 Trump is banning bump stocks but I see little to no coverage .. if Obama could get that done the media would be praising him as the messiah  proving it’s not about the issues its about your team/party winning
255 2018-12-18 23:18:08 #Bitcoin attracts more safe haven money as pros rotate out of stocks, bonds, oil. $28,000 still in play.
256 2018-12-18 23:18:05 They banned bump stocks
257 2018-12-18 23:18:02 Besides, if your issue with the ban is because it bans bump stocks, that's an issue, because the 2nd Amendment allows for a "well-regulated militia".
If your issue with the ban is because the president illegally changed the law, then I have no issue with your problem.
258 2018-12-18 23:17:57 Whoa... the GOP watches MSNBC? That makes sense because FOX's demographic probably would be pissed about banning bump stocks.
259 2018-12-18 23:17:57 You're right. I really hate:

Low unemployment 

Millions off food stamps

Highest wages in history

Peace on the Korean peninsula (Remember when everyone thought we were headed for nuclear war?)

Immigration laws upheld

Bump stocks banned

Tax breaks for low/middle class
260 2018-12-18 23:17:45 Looks like the Captains of Industry are abandoning their Ship as they are the ones selling their Own Stocks
261 2018-12-18 23:17:26 I agree, but isn’t it possible that Magnuson-Stevens helped with rebuilding stocks?  Looks like the reauthorization if M-S will have to wait until next year at the earliest. The Modern Fish Act though looks poised to become law. The House votes tomorrow, December 19th.
262 2018-12-18 23:17:06 When are you going to break the news about bump stocks to the gun nutters? That's going to be fun!
263 2018-12-18 23:17:05 8 breakouts: $BIV, $BLV, $MTLS. No penny stocks. Small group but caution remains the dominant strategy.
264 2018-12-18 23:17:02 Right now is when Cramer would be screaming “BUY! BUY! BUY!” were this stocks.
265 2018-12-18 23:16:48 Bump stocks banned another ploy to deflect from what's really happening with the investigations. Trump is a genius at that.
266 2018-12-18 23:16:37 If your reading this and playing smash ult online, 3 stocks chief. It aint Sm4sh anymore.
267 2018-12-18 23:16:34 not even waiting 90 days to hand guns/bump stocks to government 

handing them now to own the libs
268 2018-12-18 23:16:33 Well who in the great fuck thinks bump stocks should be legal? Christ already
269 2018-12-18 23:15:54 @TMFJMo @MFIndustryFocus Savings accounts at Capital One 360 or Goldman Sachs Marcus are vehicles to store your emergency fund in and everyone should have 3 - 6 months of expenses in an emergency fund before they buy stocks!
270 2018-12-18 23:15:44 Good.  But guaranteed Trump thought “bump stocks” were stocks that got a bump on Wall Street. 
271 2018-12-18 23:15:31 I got a letter from the NRA about how the evil liberals were trying to ban bump stocks. (This same letter claimed they were a nonpartisan organization.) This is sure to make some people insist liberals are lying about them demanding to keep bump stocks legal.
272 2018-12-18 23:15:27 laughing at all those who voted for trump because they thought he’d support their second amendment currently crying over him banning bump stocks. laughable.
273 2018-12-18 23:15:25 First of all, bump stocks are completely stupid.  Secondly, this will do jack shit for public safety. You can accomplish the same thing in 5 mins if you go on YouTube.  Before anyone says "but the Vegas shooting!". That loon could have legally purchased a belt fed machinegun.
274 2018-12-18 23:14:58 Trump administration banned bump stocks taking effect in March. Something the democrats screamed for a year ago but totally silent about it now. How pathetic and ungrateful.
275 2018-12-18 23:14:53 Now that they successfully eliminated bump stocks the anti-gunners will declare victory and go home. Peace for our time.
276 2018-12-18 23:14:48 No the price of a full auto license  is what made bump stocks so popular. when given the choice to pay huge amounts for a full auto license or buy a bump stock instead most people will take the cheaper option.
277 2018-12-18 23:14:44 So what are you going to do if police officers come with a warrant to confiscate your bump stocks?
278 2018-12-18 23:14:23 Holy shit the Trump Administration banned Bump Stocks

That is so out of character and it looks like we're getting gun control
279 2018-12-18 23:14:17 Banning bump stocks in no way makes you less capable of defending yourself.
280 2018-12-18 23:14:16 Lmao I least I don't have to be that guy (you) who dc's when I'm loosing by 2 stocks
281 2018-12-18 23:13:43 Samuelson said stocks predicted 7 out of the last 5. 15/16 was a false alarm. Now it’s for real. #recession
282 2018-12-18 23:13:38 Daaym! Congratz bro
283 2018-12-18 23:13:37 apple stocks rise by 20%.
284 2018-12-18 23:13:29 That is why we love dividend paying stocks and compound interest!
285 2018-12-18 23:13:16 ... and all this "bump stock" hoopla from Vegas, where there has been no forensic confirmation that either of the two modified rifles found in the room were actually used in the shooting.
ProTip- They weren't, "bump stocks" are crap in the offhand & even more so in prone fires.
286 2018-12-18 23:13:05 4/4 I will partially agree with you is that loopholes like bump stocks and pistol braces (which should violate NFA sbr and mg restrictions) should be closed. However, arbitrary regs of scary features like "pistol grips" and "muzzle shrouds" need to be reexamined concurrently
287 2018-12-18 23:13:00 MAGA Twitter 0800 18 December 2018: Banning bump stocks would be an unconstitutional infringement on my right to keep and bear arms! 2A! MAGA!

MAGA Twitter 1700 18 December 2018: I don't even have a bump stock, what do I care? 2A! MAGA!
288 2018-12-18 23:12:48 We wanted bump stocks banned, yes, but we wanted many other things as well.

Just banning bump stocks and saying "there, problem solved" is BS and won't solve anything.
289 2018-12-18 23:12:20 I love #REITs  !!!   #ABR #VER #WPC #VER 

Any REITs investors out there  investing on these #stocks ?
290 2018-12-18 23:12:07  Facts! Boy I wanna invest in soooo many stocks at these levels!
291 2018-12-18 23:12:05 Clearly shows you have ZERO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT STOCKS.. If you have been banging your head on SEC and EDGAR web-portal give it a break.. they might block your IP thinking you are a spammer, oops did i speak the truth.. Mr.Doherty clearly said ANY MINUTE/HOUR/DAY in the next 2 wks.
292 2018-12-18 23:11:45 "The @NRA lawyers could have their sights on the rule, and a senior DOJ official said the agency is prepared to defend the rule. @SenFeinstein has said legislation is the only way to ban bump stocks. Her bill to do so has 41 cosponsors, all Democrats."  
  Todd Ruger @ToddRuger
293 2018-12-18 23:11:26 This Sell The Rip scan looks interesting as it is configured to alert stocks that are spiking up to the 50 day moving average. 
And lately in this market, the 50 day ma has been very strong resistance. Thus price dropping when it hits that level. A very good SHORT trade scan also
294 2018-12-18 23:11:06 Wow surprised Trump's administration would ban bump stocks!
295 2018-12-18 23:11:00 U.S traded crude oil fell 7.3% to $46.24 a barrel, putting its losses since October 1 at more than 35%. Energy stocks in the  S&P 500 lost 2.4%
296 2018-12-18 23:10:31 U.S traded crude oil fell 7.3% to $46.24 a barrel, putting its losses since October 1 at more than 35%. Energy stocks in the  S&P 500 lost 2.4%
297 2018-12-18 23:09:40 banding bump stocks is a *no brainer* and I guess, in turn par for the course.
298 2018-12-18 23:09:14 Lol these stocks are funny
299 2018-12-18 23:09:02 LIBERALS: Ban bump stocks!!!
LIBERALS: too late.
300 2018-12-18 23:08:58 Starting to be reminiscent of the financial crisis meltdown in 08. People thought it was end of the world.But markets did pretty well after that.Right now feels very similar, in the Venture Exchange especially,most days its hard to see stocks ever being green again..we're close
301 2018-12-18 23:08:13 Obama didn't come for your guns, but Trump wants your bump stocks.
302 2018-12-18 23:08:12 bump stocks have nothing to do with reloading, they basically allow semi automatic rifles to fire like full auto machine guns
303 2018-12-18 23:08:07 They want another fix of free tax rebates to buy back more stocks.
304 2018-12-18 23:08:05 I have been following for one year and all I see is positive tweets. Everything is not blind trust, what data do we have? Stocks are crashing but would they come to crypto? Why did crypto pumped last year? what are explanation behind all this?
305 2018-12-18 23:08:04 What are pot stocks hot now... because you have to be high AF to buy and hold in this market. 
Also I’m holding some stocks 
306 2018-12-18 23:07:57 We absolutely must stop playing games with this important issue. Ban bump stocks!
307 2018-12-18 23:07:54 I thought this was some sort of Destiny thing and then I realized I had no idea what the fuck you guys were talking about so I figured it was some kind of military thing because I googled MOS and it was like the second result behind the stocks for The Mosaic Company.
308 2018-12-18 23:07:50 "Fully automatic rifles are tightly controlled by federal law, and owning one ... is a felony punishable by up to 10 years in jail. But the bump stocks, which allow a shooter to fire off up to 800 rounds per minute, have been repeatedly certified as legal." - LA Times
309 2018-12-18 23:07:35 From making bump stocks illegal to creating the Space Command, 45 is starting to make law bypassing Congress!  Wasn't he and the GOP against that and expanding government?
310 2018-12-18 23:06:51 CNBC tells us now, stocks are moving after their close on the Dow. Time for Fed to NOT raise rates and for believers in the Trump eco. to show the Dem leftists that free enterprise is far superior to their socialist baloney.
311 2018-12-18 23:06:38 Assault styled weapons*

Pro-gun nuts are quick to point out that assault rifles are automatic. Assault STYLED lumps in the semi-auto weapons that can be just as devastating, especially qith the aide of mods like bump stocks.

Just nit picking, friend :p
312 2018-12-18 23:06:29 First bump stocks, next? #TrumpGunBan
313 2018-12-18 23:06:03 @realDonaldTrump Thank you for working to ban bump stocks!
314 2018-12-18 23:05:52 Bump stocks?
315 2018-12-18 23:05:42 So even though I don’t like trump I have no problem giving credit where credit is due. Today he banned bump stocks which is great and he pushed even more for space force which as far as I know is incredible for the space industry, where ever the military goes an industry follows.
316 2018-12-18 23:05:27 I think that's a great start...break ground for the wall and bump stocks are gone!
317 2018-12-18 23:04:41 $VRUS and $RMRK, two stocks that may pop hard . Happy to own both, for NEITHER have been a stressful venture for me!!
318 2018-12-18 23:03:36 I'm not being intentionally dense.

Are you saying a bump stock made a mass shooting happen, or having the ability to apply for a full auto permit had any affect on bump stocks?
319 2018-12-18 23:03:35 Means nothing there are thousands and millions of bump stocks out there you think everyone's going to turn the minute and with the technology we have now they can build them in their backyards really sad really really sad
320 2018-12-18 23:03:31 Bump stocks are not firearms. You can't load up a bump stock and shoot with just that.

They can too confiscate without compensation as long as they aren't reusing what they take for the public.

Reading is fundamental.
321 2018-12-18 23:03:19 Some idiot associated with Teen Mom was visited by the Secret Service last week bc he threatened Individual 1 over bump stocks.
322 2018-12-18 23:03:08 stocks: down
pictures of bears: up
323 2018-12-18 23:02:15 Thanks for that. I wish they came up with something better. Its funny how people see crypto like stocks in a company.
324 2018-12-18 23:02:14 Let me guess: POTUS will not mention banning bump-stocks or restricting sales of assault-style weapons?
325 2018-12-18 23:02:09 I was reading the abstract for the first one. Random walks are a math thing that can apply to the movement of particles in space, the values of stocks, etc. Also easy and fun to program with simple tools.
326 2018-12-18 23:01:58 There arent many stocks doing well these days. If you got one just be thankful.
327 2018-12-18 23:01:49 those aren't stocks tho, he made that design on his own.
328 2018-12-18 23:01:34 Just looking at Q1 2016 and looks he stocks bottomed out around 12% below 200dma.. this was also with a lot less constructive earnings and growth backdrop
329 2018-12-18 23:01:31 hahaha yezzur thx bro!
330 2018-12-18 23:01:10 Is anyone else  feeling disheartened by GOP and President Trump:
NO WALL
NO DEFUND PP
NO HOLDING SWAMP ACCOUNTABE
BAN BUMP STOCKS
GIVING MONEY TO FOREIGN COUNTIES TO BUILD A WALL
GIVING MONEY TO MEXICO AND GUATAMALA
There is more. When do we get what we ask for???????????
331 2018-12-18 23:01:05 Banning bump stocks is good. It won’t prevent a single suicide though + suicide accounts for nearly 2/3 gun deaths. If you want to solve the problem, #SuicidePrevention can’t be an afterthought. It needs to be the primary focus. #ThisIsOurLane @ChrisMurphyCT @GiffordsCourage
332 2018-12-18 23:00:55 wait what
taking stocks from google images is literally illegal, regardless of who does it, you can be sued for that shit dude
333 2018-12-18 23:00:37 The average PA worker received a 2 cent bonus w #GOPTaxScam Big Corporations used the tax breaks to buy back stocks & reward executives. Trickle Down economics doesn't work it never has. @RepBrianFitz has endorsed The GOP and Trump with his silence and his votes. #TrumpShutdown
334 2018-12-18 23:00:19 The feds are turning (thousands?) of Americans into criminals for possessing legally purchased bump stocks because of what the DOJ/public incorrectly believes those items are capable of.
335 2018-12-18 23:00:05 Trump banned bump stocks.  It’s hard to celebrate because it has the stench of Trump.
336 2018-12-18 22:59:59 It’s definitely a good thing that bump stocks are banned-but not offering the owners who return them any sort of compensation? They bought that and it financially became an asset- seems no incentive to give it back/destroy- if anything the gov’t is raising street/collector value
337 2018-12-18 22:59:57 Since Trump banned bump stocks does that mean liberals will be marching the streets demanding bump stocks back?
338 2018-12-18 22:59:41 It was a bound to happen story...all that which Trump professed was 'because ppl wanted him there. Constantly braiggin that all good happening was because of him, i.e. stocks, housing, gas. (trickle down affect of Obama), is ready to implode because of HIM T!! R u ready?
339 2018-12-18 22:59:18 Cool, so buy US stocks. Got it #MAGA
340 2018-12-18 22:59:18 Just today I heard 3 Trump ardent Trump supporters admit they were wrong about him. You know why??? Because he's banning bump stocks! Not because of long list of horrible and illegal things he's done.  After all those years of them saying Obama would take their guns! LOL
341 2018-12-18 22:59:09 That’s insane. Those people should be placed in stocks in the town square so they can be mocked.
342 2018-12-18 22:58:58 Since Trump banned bump stocks does that mean liberals will be marching the streets demanding bump stocks back?
343 2018-12-18 22:58:50 Hey Stephen do they know who has  bump stocks? Is their a registery somewhere?
344 2018-12-18 22:58:32 The main strategy should be divestment, which of course involves removing Saudi companies from mutual funds and divestment of stocks from companies that do business with Saudis.
345 2018-12-18 22:58:17 No, he screwed potential killers. You do not need bump stocks for self defense
346 2018-12-18 22:57:49 I saw it happen. Her bump stocks committed "suiside"  by driving a boat off a waterfall. They are known to cause death all by themselves
347 2018-12-18 22:57:39 If you’re reported having one then it gets taken away. That’s less bump stocks out on the street.
348 2018-12-18 22:56:58 So making bump stocks illegal is going to keep shootings from happening ? Next step is them trying to take them . Damn idiots.
349 2018-12-18 22:56:41 Bill I knew a recession was coming. When tax cuts came, and @CNBC indicated that stock buybacks pretty much artificially inflated stock prices. Hell I’m glad I’m in money market, and bonds more than stocks now. Trump market is a recession in the making.
350 2018-12-18 22:56:37 if you play with 2 stocks or less than a 5 minute timer you have <0 IQ
351 2018-12-18 22:56:32 Ain't no one worried about Bump Stocks. They can have that.
352 2018-12-18 22:56:24 Now that the NRA has been exposed for funneling Russian $$ to GOP and claiming millions in losses @realDonaldTrump decides to outlaw bump stocks? We see the the hypocrisy asshole.
353 2018-12-18 22:56:24 this is why I want to quit Twitter
354 2018-12-18 22:56:19 Bump stocks are inaccurate and stupid. They're a toy. I guess they'll ban my finger next, like Benecio Del Toro in Sicario 2.
355 2018-12-18 22:56:15 The parts of a gun independent a lower receiver were parts, not a gun. Does the bump stock ban define the stock itself as a machine gun? Or is the stock attached to a gun a machine gun? I assume the former as the stocks themselves are illegal? What precedent might this set?
356 2018-12-18 22:56:13 Great day for Trump Supporters:

Trump caves on the wall (again)

Will give Mexico $5 billion for economic issues

Former NatSec Advisor is in court as a felon (thanks to Trump mishandling this issue all along)

Ban on Bump Stocks announced

And it’s not even 5:00 pm...
357 2018-12-18 22:56:03 Well Trump officially banned bump stocks. Good because I know that people who have these are utter maniacs.
When we say no automatics we mean no automatics only semi automatics.
358 2018-12-18 22:56:01 Wondering... will her 3rd attempt be involving bump stocks? One should worry, no?
359 2018-12-18 22:55:48 No they never told us!
All ppl care bout Vegas is bump stocks pretty damn good misdirection
360 2018-12-18 22:55:45 Did they use bump fire stocks at wounded knee or at other massacres previous to that? That would mean they were available and in common use prior th the NFA of 1934 wouldn’t it?
361 2018-12-18 22:55:35 Amazon exports the Union of the Order and its return freedoms in the formation of the holding of international companies and the acquisition of the powers of the competence of the Royal Declaration and the integration of independence by the realization of US stocks and return to
362 2018-12-18 22:55:11 I hope you’re right. Trump And MAGA are having a shitty December. Wall/Muller/Flynn/Bump Stocks/Talks of Recession/Morale I want something good to happen for us!
363 2018-12-18 22:54:43 Read it...bump stocks will be banned...you have until march to turn them in...read it begore you criticize...sheesh.
364 2018-12-18 22:54:31 16 years after, it’s clear that the internet changed everything. “By the end of the stock market downturn of 2002, stocks had lost $5 trillion in market capitalization since the peak. At its trough on October 9, 2002, the NASDAQ-100 had dropped to 1,114, down 78%” #CryptoBubble
365 2018-12-18 22:54:26 Ancock stocks them.
366 2018-12-18 22:54:20 Waiting to hear the failing NRA's explanation for why we legitimately need "bump stocks".
*"I'm legally blind and it will help me hit that deer to shoot 500x/minute"
*"Sometimes I hear noises at night and need to shoot a few hundred rounds REALLY FAST"
*"Wanted to enlist/SCARED!"
367 2018-12-18 22:54:00 Bump stocks made illegal today, fyi. You gonna stop kids from hunting with their dad's? What's next? Fishing?
368 2018-12-18 22:53:40 7 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy for 2019 -  #data_center #IT
369 2018-12-18 22:53:31 This is so dumb, there's no sporting purpose to these bump stocks. Ban them.
370 2018-12-18 22:53:27 So you ban bump stocks and gave an arbitrary date for surrender or destroy. So you are confiscating someones property without compensation. How does this not violate the 5th ammendment?
Enjoy your time left in office single termer #nevertrump
371 2018-12-18 22:53:21 I will never get over the people who run 2 stocks 3 mins on Ultimate Quickplay lol.  People know what you're trying to do lol.
372 2018-12-18 22:53:08 Turn in those bump stocks NRA jihadists.
373 2018-12-18 22:52:53 @marklevinshow it isn't that bump stocks have been banned (I didn't care for 'em) but rather that once one item is taken from law-abiding citizen's it's just the beginning of the destruction of #2A & eventual confiscation of every firearm in your house.
374 2018-12-18 22:52:40 I usually mock you and your inability to write coherent sentences or spell.  But banning bump stocks is a great start.  Thank you.
375 2018-12-18 22:52:30 Matutulog palang ako yari stocks ko neto mamaya gudnyt xd
376 2018-12-18 22:52:25 bump stocks.
377 2018-12-18 22:51:47 Stocks go on a 9 year run and everything’s great, a few months of decline and it’s 2009 all over again? #buytheselloff #canttimethwmarket
378 2018-12-18 22:51:45 I saw one today on the corner threatening a child!  Get them all out of this country!!  Bump stocks have a mind power that consumes poor unsuspecting altar boys.
379 2018-12-18 22:51:45 Still adding monthly to ISA & Pensions for juicy quality div stocks/funds/trusts etc adding monthly helps
380 2018-12-18 22:51:11 Bump stocks????  That's all you've got???  FAILURE . . . again.
381 2018-12-18 22:50:23 The answer ISNT banning bump stocks or banning more guns. Stop punishing American citizens and infringing on OUR rights because of what some criminals do. AND SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL WE GET THE WALL.
382 2018-12-18 22:50:09 In simple terms, at the moment we pay (say) £2bn for scientific research. But the UK science industry gets £1bn funding. The other billion stocks Juncker’s wine cellar. If you are unhappy with the government allocation of funding, vote them out. Try doing that with the EU
383 2018-12-18 22:49:55 Business idea: Shop that stocks all different kinds of kitchen cabinet handles that you can browse and experience over a beer or wine. Business name: Handlebar.
384 2018-12-18 22:49:36 I imagine more guns was high on the list.

Might help counteract some of the anger at you about bump stocks.
385 2018-12-18 22:48:59 With 20000 gun laws in America what exactly is common sense gun law

 That expression means nothing without definition

He just banned bump stocks or didn't you hear

 But you don't need a bump stock to bump stock
386 2018-12-18 22:48:46 Wouldn't the Hughes amendment make this suggestion impossible? @DLoesch why isn't the NRA criticizing the ATF for changing the language of existing law without Congressional input? Congress has never voted to ban bump stocks. #lifemember by the way
387 2018-12-18 22:48:19 Yesterday - Industry: #FOOD, BEVERAGE & TOBACCO was 12% Positive, with #DIVERSIFIED FINANCIALS 5% Positive. Stocks: $AUZ was 20% Positive, with $SPX 4% Positive. #ASX
388 2018-12-18 22:48:09 THEY DO NOT TURN THEM INTO MACHINE GUNS!! You sound like an ignorant liberal talking about things when you have no idea how they work. I could take or leave bump stocks, but this is a BAD move Trump, bad, bad, bad.
389 2018-12-18 22:48:01 Lol no kid. I dont get emotional about stocks but nice try though. Keep it coming baboon. 
390 2018-12-18 22:47:48 And don't forget.....after 100% support - Mr. Potus looses a vote over the WH compromise on. Our security walls and now;  "bump stocks".... Never would have thought. He just lost my vote
391 2018-12-18 22:47:45 What are the ticker symbols for the immoral activity stocks. Sounds like an opportunity!
392 2018-12-18 22:47:35 Our president just banned bump stocks. This is the first time a firearm accessory has been federally banned, but I'm sure he will still get blamed for the drop in sales to shooting supply stores.
393 2018-12-18 22:47:22 Trump supporters yesterday: “Ban bump stocks? How dare you infringe on my 2nd Amendment  rights!”

Trump supporters today: “I don’t use a bump stock anyways. MAGA!”
394 2018-12-18 22:47:14 Trump supporters yesterday: “Ban bump stocks? How dare you infringe on my 2nd Amendment  rights!”

Trump supporters today: “I don’t use a bump stock anyways. MAGA!”
395 2018-12-18 22:46:58 El gobierno de Estados Unidos anunció la prohibición de las "bump stocks", un dispositivo que permite disparar con un rifle ráfagas automáticas y que se utilizó durante el tiroteo en Las Vegas en octubre de 2017.
396 2018-12-18 22:46:52 I disappointed bump stocks were ever on the market..
397 2018-12-18 22:46:48 Trump supporters yesterday: “Ban bump stocks? How dare you infringe on my 2nd Amendment  rights!”

Trump supporters today: “I don’t use a bump stock anyways. MAGA!”
398 2018-12-18 22:46:23 He runs a crypto hedge fund. Of course he’s going to hedge his position. Just like stocks, people talk them up all the time, doesn’t mean they don’t hedge for unforeseen downturns. Anybody knows this 
399 2018-12-18 22:46:17 Dude, eight years of Obama prowling around the corner, organizing all the black helicopters and patiently waiting to take your guns—and the fucking guy who bans bump stocks is Donald John Trump. What a world
400 2018-12-18 22:46:04 And Bump Stocks?! Forgot about those. 
401 2018-12-18 22:45:55 Sawed offs become easier to conceal for a single person to do a lot of close quarter spread damage in a crowd. I think bump stocks now fit that criteria, but admittedly i dont know their practical benefits either. I would need to know why NOT to ban the mod.
402 2018-12-18 22:45:13 Bump stocks don't qualify them according to your idea.
403 2018-12-18 22:44:44 Yep. The wall thing isn't as easy, I get that. But banning bump stocks was a slap in our faces after gushing about how much he loves the 2A.
404 2018-12-18 22:44:41 Trump banned bump stocks today  so by March 21 all bump stocks must be turned in.
405 2018-12-18 22:44:39 Yeah, I'd like to know too. About all three stocks. But twitter is awkward cause truthfully we are owed nothing :-) Sounds like Todd has the flu, which likely explains the quiet. I read that $TLRY $NOV news is what hit GW today. That's nonsense IMO.
406 2018-12-18 22:44:09 buy penny stocks if ur starting
407 2018-12-18 22:43:58 Why'd you sell us out on bump stocks? #2A, #ShallNotBeInfringed
408 2018-12-18 22:43:53 You don’t even know 1 thing about bump stocks.
409 2018-12-18 22:43:39 While my stocks of alcohol remain topped up there won't be any arguments #chillin
410 2018-12-18 22:43:38 apple stocks rise by 69%.
411 2018-12-18 22:43:19 If 2 of 5 my bump stocks are stolen, how many do I have left? 27, I lied about only having 5.
412 2018-12-18 22:43:15 @realDonaldTrump thank you for banning bump stocks
413 2018-12-18 22:43:06 Fuck bump stocks, like who fucking cares, just ban them.
414 2018-12-18 22:42:38 I'm sure there is some citation you can refer to regarding these experts stating the bump stocks used actually slowed down the rate of fire thereby reducing casualties.
415 2018-12-18 22:42:37 No wall?banning bump stocks
The USA just died.The constitution is null and void.Also it's time to settle camp lejune poisoned water.
416 2018-12-18 22:42:27 I, personally,  have mixed emotions re: bump stocks. Having never owned or known anyone that does, I'll side towards "shall not be infringed". But with reservations.
417 2018-12-18 22:42:08 $BA $NFLX $FB $NVDA & $UA were my top performing #stocks today
418 2018-12-18 22:41:48 What’s fun is that the People will not turn their bump stocks in. You know that’s a prelude to breaking free of DC, right?
419 2018-12-18 22:41:48 (4/4)
Any down fall eventually follows by upside, the question is where the bottom could be which at the end depends on every single stocks valuation
420 2018-12-18 22:41:14 Gun control doesn’t work,however banning bump stocks is a sensible thing to do.
421 2018-12-18 22:41:05 Time to buy bump stocks....  guess they're finally going to be illegal.
422 2018-12-18 22:41:03 Please! Can someone tell me how banning bump stocks is going to make a weapon safer? It’s not. Why don’t anti-gun nuts learn about guns before making themselves look dumb?
423 2018-12-18 22:40:43 Anything to stop Trump from breaking the law. Any part of his plans that make sense (like Prison Reform and banning bump stocks) is fine. Im not against EVERYTHING he's done, just most things. But no man is above the law.
424 2018-12-18 22:40:43 I own an AR 15, and this is coming from first hand knowledge. Also bump stocks have been used in mayybe 5 shootings, if that. Main weapons used are almost always handguns.
425 2018-12-18 22:40:25 For 8 years Obama did nothing about mass shootings and you blamed congress. @realDonaldTrump takes comprehensive actionS and you minimize it to just one of the program actions...bump stocks...so you can say you that you supported the program without promoting it.

Pathetic!
426 2018-12-18 22:40:13 and stocks are on track for the worst December since the Great Depression. SCREW YOU PIGGY BOY TRUMP AND YOUR TACKY GOLD DIGGER TOO. YOU BOTH ARE UGLY NO MATTER WHAT AMOUNT OF DRESS UP FOR PHOTO OP.
427 2018-12-18 22:40:12  I also just scanned the prohibited items and thought one said "socks" and I was like, "why can't I give the gift of warm feet?" until I realized it actually said "stocks."
428 2018-12-18 22:39:34 Field of dreams. I sold growth/early stage stocks for many years.  All of a sudden there's an awakening in the institutional community when there's an, "uh huh" moment.  They have built it they will come. Watch the price action.  One day there will be a large bar on huge volume.
429 2018-12-18 22:39:25 hirap na hirap nako maghanap ng supreme baby @andresepnio_  bilhan nalang kita sa divisoria 300 lang, marami pang stocks  HAHAHAHA! labyu
430 2018-12-18 22:39:21 It doesn't stop with bump stocks. Watch them go after arm braces next. Lucky for you AR pistol owners, the registry isn't closed to SBRs, so you'll probably just get an amnesty to register them or remove the barrels.
431 2018-12-18 22:39:14 I wonder if any criminals will be turning in their bump stocks 
432 2018-12-18 22:39:07 US stocks have been smashed this quarter, particularly tech. Retail still in BTD mode. Fintwit hanging on Fed news. Wish I could say I stepped back from it all but I punted on a few calls today 
433 2018-12-18 22:38:54 Grasso says he doesn't short stocks, but I'll bet owns a boatload of puts #FastMoney
434 2018-12-18 22:38:51 Doesnt change anything, bump stocks arent registered. Also super easy to bump fire an ar 15 without one anyways. Hes just trying to save face and not look like a moron.
435 2018-12-18 22:38:47 Soon as these stocks crash god gone bless the whole hood
436 2018-12-18 22:38:26 The Justice Department has announced a rule banning bump stocks, but the gun lobby has already said it will sue to block the rule. We need to pass a law to ban these dangerous devices and Republicans must support my bill.
437 2018-12-18 22:38:15 Nationwide ban on bump stocks? Gov. buying them back?
438 2018-12-18 22:38:12 Because bump stocks pose a considerable threat to public safety? If fully automatic weapons are meant to be illegal, why allow for loopholes like bump stocks?
439 2018-12-18 22:37:56 I have not been able to give gifts to many friends for a long time. I am sorry. I have 50 friends. I have a request for @NianticLabs and @NianticHelp. I would like more stocks of gifts than 10 pieces.
440 2018-12-18 22:37:27 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @FLOTUS I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER WHAT SIDE YOU'RE ON PRESIDENT TRUMP AS YOUR BANNING BUMP STOCKS. LOOK UP DICK ACT OF 1902! BILLIONS FOR 5G, LOCKHEED MARTIN IS CHEMTRAILING & POISONING US, WALL TAKING AWAY OUR SUN. GET ON THE SIDE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOW
441 2018-12-18 22:37:21 Trump just banned bump stocks and the cuckservatives aren't angry over it. True Definition of a brainwashed cuck. Trumptards have no honor, its okay for the government to infringe on the second amendment as long as Trump is president
442 2018-12-18 22:37:19 BHO lent w/ Govt Funds, was said to've been returned w/ Interest... Did Citz ever recv the millions? Did BHO or Team get or keep stocks/else in Companies held open?
443 2018-12-18 22:36:55 Don't forget you got 90 days to turn in or destroy your bump stocks!
444 2018-12-18 22:36:50 @CNBC stop referring to cannabis companies as "pot stocks" making "pot" jokes and showing movie clips with "pot" smoking.  Cannabis companies are helping in the health sector first, jobs and economy. It's not about recreational "pot". That's small potatoes #cannabis
445 2018-12-18 22:36:43 There’s no justification for bump stocks that transform semi-automatic weapons into machine guns? Who needs a bump stock, when you can go to a gun show and buy the real machine gun, and do it without a background check.  Republicans  and the NRA have blood on their hands
446 2018-12-18 22:36:40 Trump administration just banned bump stocks
447 2018-12-18 22:36:18 The only thing stupider than a bump stock is this process of banning them.

Bump stocks wouldn't exist except for the unconstitutional ban on possession of modern military rifles - exactly the most important arms to be protected.
448 2018-12-18 22:35:56 @grassosteve @CNBCFastMoney
#XI said @ 40 yr reform meeting (paraphrasing) # China was in for extremely difficult times ahead. Also China #Stocks would put pressure on U.S. stocks in 2019.
Implying China is a (no) deal on #TradeWar.
Your take?
449 2018-12-18 22:35:49 Outlawing Bump Stocks only makes them more valuable!
450 2018-12-18 22:35:19 you can say whatever about trump but he has banned bump stocks on guns. Massive strides towards better gun control. With this, I salute you @realDonaldTrump
451 2018-12-18 22:35:02 My tax rate is higher than Sanders though he is in a higher tax bracket. Now if only he will show his complete tax returns to show how he is able to avoid paying his fair share. I don’t hide my salary in property and stocks and whatever other tax dodging scheme like Sanders does.
452 2018-12-18 22:34:58 Pisani, Pot stocks then maybe 10+ minutes of bitcoin. Usually when I flick away and maybe tune back for final trade. #cnbc @cnbc
453 2018-12-18 22:34:17 Bump stocks
454 2018-12-18 22:34:13 bump stocks were banned 
455 2018-12-18 22:33:48 Yeah thats what i mean, anything that will modify the gun and change the rate of fire. But bump stocks do increase the rate of fire
456 2018-12-18 22:33:43 .@toddgordontrade says on @CNBC that $AMZN could drop to $800. If that happens, I’d say it’s a harbinger of significant weakness in #cloud infrastructure. Every other stock in the tech sector will also suffer. Makes sense given the drop in #semiconductor stocks
457 2018-12-18 22:33:31 Who’s left and who’s right banning bump stocks Mr President ?? It’s so a property rights issue @RepThomasMassie @RandPaul @KrisAnneHall @realDonaldTrump @PeteSantilli_ @DebbieBarth @The_Trump_Train

464 2018-12-18 22:32:42 @LeeMcAdoo_TDA My portfolio of stocks is not doing that bad. What do you think of Government and Corp. Bonds? I have no experience with bonds but today's WSJ is touting them.
465 2018-12-18 22:32:09 "Quality" LOL! You mean like $GE?  That's a very dangerous idea... all stocks are worthless pieces of paper unless someone else is willing to buy.  Like a painting, there in little to no intrinsic value. All stocks are risky regardless of "quality."
466 2018-12-18 22:30:36 Okay everybody, repeat after me. 

"No officer, I don't own any bump stocks. And I also don't know how to make one. And I also also really don't know how to make a belt loop do the same thing."
467 2018-12-18 22:30:23 Listen you brought up the Clintons to deflect from my original tweet . You're not hurting my feeling with your Clinton,  Obama nonsense . 
I am glad trump took executive action to ban bump stocks today.
468 2018-12-18 22:30:23 My father-in-law is a small farmer not eligible for 45’s “assistance”. Negative return on his soy bean crop, his ‘retirement fund’ is what he has invested in stocks. He is sorry now that he voted for tRump.
469 2018-12-18 22:29:58 Damn. Was on the way to the range and someone broke into my car and stole all my guns and bump stocks. What a shame
470 2018-12-18 22:29:53 Why does @CNBCFastMoney have a technician on air talking crazy about $AMZN hitting $900 and S&P hitting 1,850? I mean for that to happen, we'd have to have a repeat of 2008. Will NEVER happen. All of this will be in the past after tomorrow at 2:00pm ET and stocks fly up 500pts.
471 2018-12-18 22:28:58 Bump stocks are dumb. Aimed fire is all that matters unless utilizing belt fed, crew served machine guns for fire superiority and suppressive fire. Bump stocks are a novelty. Just a good way to waste ammo and $
472 2018-12-18 22:28:09 At last...your value managers buying beaten up growth stocks at the wrong time?
473 2018-12-18 22:28:03 You would have to write a book to list all the stocks that are down 
474 2018-12-18 22:28:01 Took me 2 stocks to properly punish an Ike who only approached with aerials. Like. Consistently. No a single grounded move. So as dedede stuffed his jump with short hop fair for his remaining stocks.
475 2018-12-18 22:27:55 And he banned bump stocks, so now some of his fanatic disciples might turn on him! WOMP! WOMP!
476 2018-12-18 22:27:43 
 Trump Bans Bump Stocks 

477 2018-12-18 22:27:29 I don't think they should be either which is also probably why I don't want bump stocks banned. It's part of a larger debate.
478 2018-12-18 22:27:27 How can they ban bump stocks without compensation  Nobody is even complaining  ffs
479 2018-12-18 22:27:27 Hahahaha no I guess what I mean is, a lot of stocks have moved a lot. Worse even than a period we called the financial crisis. But panic levels seem light. What’s going on?
480 2018-12-18 22:27:26 plexus stocks in google
481 2018-12-18 22:26:52 The Department of Justice announced Tuesday the finalized form of the bump stock ban, achieved by amending ATF regulation so as to define bump stocks as “machineguns.”
482 2018-12-18 22:26:48 Is your point people died for bump stocks.  I don't get it.
483 2018-12-18 22:26:17 They will raise because they don’t care about the stocks
484 2018-12-18 22:26:11 Bump stocks are a novelty item. No one is sad to see them go. I am surprised that Trump and the Republicans couldn't get the Hearing Protection Act (legalizing unregistered sound suppressors) passed.
485 2018-12-18 22:26:06 But only while stocks last
486 2018-12-18 22:26:04 You’re a Macro Tourist my friend. Headline to headline finding events that fit your political narrative. Stocks peaked when Growth and Inflation peaked. 3Q18
487 2018-12-18 22:25:52 FUCK YO BUMP STOCKS

488 2018-12-18 22:25:45 I recently lost all my bump stocks in a freak boating accident.
489 2018-12-18 22:25:43 Bump stocks may not be that big a deal, but banning them sure is. That action is in direct opposition to 2A’s prohibition against ANY infringement on our right to defend ourselves against a tyrannical government... keep ... smh
490 2018-12-18 22:25:41 This administration has me looking all over for what the catch is. Did we really get bump stocks banned???
491 2018-12-18 22:25:36 The #DOJ Defines Bump Stocks as ‘Machineguns,’ Gives The Public 90 Days to Hand Them Over.
492 2018-12-18 22:25:20 I think you can fab large magazines. I think bump stocks have a sliding part that is spring loaded, recoil bounces the trigger on the finger
493 2018-12-18 22:25:05 All these lawsuits against @FortniteGame maybe I should cash out on my Fortnite stocks rn 
494 2018-12-18 22:24:54 I'm going to post watchlist charts for tomorrow in a bit. So you can track them and see how stocks react to support and resistance from small to large caps!
495 2018-12-18 22:24:42 It's a slippery slope from bump stocks to total gun confiscation. Trump's true libtard colors are starting to show. #Resist #SecondAmendment #WhenYouPryMyColdDeadFingersFromTheTrigger

And count your 'theory' of "air time" of 1-5 second transaction time.. less on the market, drives up value blabla..... you are stuck at how stocks work right now..
499 2018-12-18 22:24:20 $NFLX and $TSLA seem to be the best two tech stocks for current market turmoil with trade war. Especially since $TSLA getting pass on imports into China. Both great buys here.
500 2018-12-18 22:24:07 Obviously  you don't know what's happening.  China is losing the battle and starting to give in. All others have already gave in. You must gave all tech stocks,  because the tech stocks are dropping the market due to them, nothing to do with Trump
501 2018-12-18 22:24:06 The Santa Claus rally on #WallStreet is happening unfortunately it does not involve buying stocks in New York, I just saw this guy on Wall Street in Dallas cheering the #DallasCowboys the #TrumpRecession is about to hit the #economy
502 2018-12-18 22:24:02 They told me if I didn't vote Republican, the government would ban bump stocks.
503 2018-12-18 22:23:56 Word is the administration will be banning bump stocks and the owners of them will have 90 days to destroy them or turn them in to law enforcement. A group is planning to sue them over this. I have been trying to sue and bring back lawn darts back to no avail.
504 2018-12-18 22:23:34 And bump stocks don't make a gun automatic. It still cycles the same as a semi automatic firearm.
505 2018-12-18 22:23:31 Invest in some hemp stocks before this farm bill legalizes it make some money thank me later
506 2018-12-18 22:23:30 @NRA @NRAILA What is the NRA's response to the attempt at banning bump stocks?
507 2018-12-18 22:23:23 After another wild day on #WallStreet the #Dow #DowJones #DJIA gained 0.35% or 82.66 points YTD return -4.22% #SP500 gained 0.01% YTD return -4.77% #NASDAQ gained 0.45% YTD return -1.73% #stocks #StockMarket #markets #investing #investments #Indices #Finance #economy #economics
508 2018-12-18 22:23:10 Exactly, this scenario was known then. So you plan for disruption, you plan for issues around perceived pharma stocks. You send clear signals to Brussels that you are planning to walk away and can deliver on it. You take the £39 billion and leverage it.
509 2018-12-18 22:23:07 Trump’s banning of bump stocks is such an uncharacteristically good thing that I wonder where he is going with it.  #Jaded #Suspicious #TooGoodToBeTrue
510 2018-12-18 22:23:05 This may not be the most profitable month to invest in stocks but it is the perfect time for us to learn and become better investors

513 2018-12-18 22:22:09 Gun stocks will be a great buy in Q4 of 2019 and Q1-Q2 of 2020
514 2018-12-18 22:21:44 Seen the federal government is making moves to ban bump stocks. I expected much more discussion #onhere about it tbqh
515 2018-12-18 22:21:22 Most gun owners think that bump fire stocks are stupid and hardly anyone owns them.
516 2018-12-18 22:20:21 when stocks are undervalued they can handle dissapointment , long way to go
517 2018-12-18 22:20:02 but Bernie is not pro gun and you know that. He gets a c- rating by the NRA in a permissive gun rights state.  He's pro background checks  He's anti automatic guns.  He was against the bump stocks.  He spoke in front of the Sebnate in favor of gun control...
518 2018-12-18 22:19:51 @Observer609: Regulation change: a ban on bump stocks will go into effect on March 21. This follows a 90-day grace period.
519 2018-12-18 22:19:45 I was just thinking that myself after seeing the footage. Plus the Admin taking action in banning bump@stocks. When I saw that, my first thought is ‘Why are they placating the public? What’s going on?’
520 2018-12-18 22:19:41 Oh great. We are be made laughing stocks
521 2018-12-18 22:19:41 and the bump stocks thing!?
522 2018-12-18 22:19:37 I deal a lot in penny stocks. Haven't seen it there yet.   Do we know what the threshold is to join that group?  Provably still too risky.

531 2018-12-18 22:18:39 Mr. Orange is such a sorry Fuck, he tried to use his corny round table of clowns and the banning of bump stocks to deflect from whats going on with his Foundation and Flynn. Like they really cared. The issue took place yrs ago and you ignored our kids...FUCK YOU!!!
532 2018-12-18 22:18:37 I agree that they will, but I don't see other mods gaining any scrutiny yet. I know they tried suppression mods but any person familiar with the model will know it is not like the silent movie version and is quite loud. 

I just dont see a reason to not ban bump stocks.

536 2018-12-18 22:18:11 Brian its obvious that trump is no longer running the show made the decision to ban bump stocks,think about it really
537 2018-12-18 22:18:08 If the NRA hadn't lost favor, the government would not have banned bump stocks.
538 2018-12-18 22:17:59 Transitioned from stocks to futures recently and after the last couple of weeks studying I made the decision to start a simulated account. +3 out of 3 trades so far. I'm doing 3 weeks trading a simulated account and then I will decide if it's time to go live. @PuranTrades @zeek
539 2018-12-18 22:17:50 Regulation change: a ban on bump stocks will go into effect on March 21. This follows a 90-day grace period.
540 2018-12-18 22:17:17 Hey #WritersCommunity, how many of my fellow #writers are also trading stocks? I’m learning how 
541 2018-12-18 22:17:11 If he does act on this (doubtful) then it should be applauded. No need for bump stocks in any situation
542 2018-12-18 22:16:30 These people don't seem to realize that you can bump-fire without those special stocks.  Also: When do you think they'll ban Jerry Miculek?
543 2018-12-18 22:16:10 It's emotional because it's being done for the sake of doing something. Bump stocks have, allegedly, been used in one crime. Some experts will say that the shooter could have killed more people without the bump stock.
544 2018-12-18 22:15:36 A Benjamin for bump stocks to @GunOwners
545 2018-12-18 22:15:26 Oh and leave are bump stocks alone!!

547 2018-12-18 22:15:17 Where are the “likes” from trump’s base? Finally, finally he has done something worthwhile by banning bump stocks. Take heed NRA.
548 2018-12-18 22:15:08 If they're buying so stupidly, they're pissing away equity.
This will lead to greater losses in the stocks of companies doing it, exacerbating the market downturn.
549 2018-12-18 22:15:01 but we banned bump stocks!!! yay, winning. lol
550 2018-12-18 22:14:57 You can do the same with a belt loop. Again, the ATF had no problem with it when they came on the market. Bump stocks is not a hill to die on, but the worry is that other modifications could be next. Those who oppose the 2nd Amendment will use this to test where they can go.
551 2018-12-18 22:14:40 You have alot of good calls on stocks. No doubt! But BEARS are eating you up in the oil markets! You are way to BULL on oil and don’t see the market traps out there.
552 2018-12-18 22:14:37 Absolute garbage. I know alot of us (myself included) don't personally care for bump stocks but that's NOT the issue here. This is just another step for full out semi-auto bans. I support you and the GOA. We must keep fighting! Thanks for everything you do Tim.
553 2018-12-18 22:14:33 Oil prices are a bit like petrol  pumps increases are passed on straight away and reductions lag.

On stocks drops are applied instantly and increases usually see stocks lagging behind playing catch up.

With that in mind better to await direction downtrend is over surely? 
554 2018-12-18 22:14:19 Ooo stable genius talking about safe schools. Does.he even know what school is? Ban bump stocks and ban military grade weapons from civilians.
555 2018-12-18 22:14:19 I'm already waiting for Feb and the next batch of Umbral Abyss. My current stocks will struggle to last that long.
556 2018-12-18 22:14:17 Are u confused lmao go look at any oil junior or midcap they are trading at valuations never seen in history. When oil was $28 in 2016 stocks were higher. You are clueless
557 2018-12-18 22:14:11 Any explanation as to why you think bump stocks should be legal?
558 2018-12-18 22:14:09 Auto stocks are down 30%, they’re not 10% or 11%, building stocks are down 35%, banks...are down 25%...the Russell is down 20%, retail equities are down over 20%. the S&P 500 down only 10% or 11%?” because utilities, staples and pharmaceuticals—economically defensive stocks
559 2018-12-18 22:13:54 Meh.

He did that to throw the media a bone after a mass shooting, he has to support it, but I doubt he'll be fussed if it goes down in court.

He picked a good target, too.  Bump stocks shouldn't be illegal, but they are pretty dumb imho
560 2018-12-18 22:13:54 galg, XRP is a new asset class....... like stocks...... before stocksmarket..... $0.00001 per "beta stock paper", launch of NYSE.. booom! $1 per stock. you need to understand that this is the introduction of a new asset class and that will have a huge first jump in price.
561 2018-12-18 22:13:40 It’s a Canadian company.... I restrict to US only... 11 New Highs for the entire world In stocks KL is one of them (long)
562 2018-12-18 22:13:40 This shows smarts and for all the Player Bs out there this will hurt your stock. If that’s the case what can the player Bs of the world do to rise their stocks ???
563 2018-12-18 22:13:31 Sounds like someone is a little butt-hurt from all the “winning.” How are your stocks doing? Did you hear the Trump Foundation was just dissolved because it’s under criminal investigation? Yet... that Clinton Foundation is still up and running. The truth hurts.

565 2018-12-18 22:13:22 That's a dumb law, bump stocks suck so bad for aim, most people probably ripped them off and shot them up after the first use. A Victory for ignorant fools who know nothing about guns or the honest people that use them.
566 2018-12-18 22:13:14 He will be introducing Trump stocks
567 2018-12-18 22:13:02 Brexiteers...if the future is bright under the threats of a No-Deal (ultimately the result of a hiding for nothing Brexit), then why are we stockpiling fridges for medical supplies, food stocks in the Supermarkets & troops for discontent? 

Please - where is the happy future?
568 2018-12-18 22:12:46 Interesting how we now need 2 books of Ethical Standards for Government. One for GOP and one for everyone else. Hoping all the talk about Trump’s world falling apart is true. He didn’t ban bump stocks today out of concern for lives, he’s trying to look good to Dem voters.
569 2018-12-18 22:12:37 Why would there be companies making millions from manufacturing bump stocks, when people could just use a shoelace, or a belt? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
570 2018-12-18 22:12:35 i'd rather watch k. rool dtilt fsmash for 6 stocks than have to witness melee ever again
571 2018-12-18 22:12:09 Ah? Tu vides les stocks?
572 2018-12-18 22:12:03 If you look at the rest of the market, especially penny stocks, this is doing even great.
573 2018-12-18 22:11:57 The Media generated hysteria that have caused stocks to plunge is a perfect opportunity to buy now.  Economy is booming. Analysts are saying recession next year. Thats such bullshit
574 2018-12-18 22:11:54 Swordies love only having 2 stocks
575 2018-12-18 22:11:37 Trump bans bump stocks

Response from gun owners who screamed for 8 years under Obama about how liberals were taking their guns away: (crickets)
576 2018-12-18 22:11:28 @NRA, you can keep you cooler to store what little is left of your dignity in. Thanks for getting Bump Stocks banned you cowards.
577 2018-12-18 22:11:27 Bump stocks banned
578 2018-12-18 22:11:09 The question is, is he on the family WhatApp group telling anyone with regular meds to start quietly ordering a bit early to get the stocks up...
579 2018-12-18 22:10:51 I'm investing in pharmaceutical stocks
580 2018-12-18 22:10:48 The right thing done the wrong way is still wrong, whether it be bump-stocks, or sending in FBI agents, because you think you can get away with it, as comey did. Neither should stand.
581 2018-12-18 22:10:25 I'm a big 2A supporter and NRA supporter and see no reason to keep bump stocks legal.

Have you watched a video on how they work?

You pull the trigger and it fires as long as you dont let go and it's recoil preps the next shot.

I dont see it as an emotional response.
582 2018-12-18 22:10:19 Not sure what you are getting at here.  No one wants to take your gun away.  Trump just passed a law today against Bump Stocks today.  Is this what you are talking about?
583 2018-12-18 22:10:10 And yet P/E of UK stocks still pretty low historically
584 2018-12-18 22:09:43 Where are you. I pay you to fight for legal ownership of bump stocks and machinegun protection.
585 2018-12-18 22:09:41 Right but his disadvantage state is honestly pretty bad even with the dial. I just hope someone can completely master the dial storage and do it to consistently take stocks at low percents. I hope ur right thou.
586 2018-12-18 22:09:38 Good ol' fudds at the @NRA can't handle fun, so they just lobby for more gun control laws. One of the biggest "pro gun" groups, yet they just banned bump stocks, and hundreds of thousands of Americans are now felons overnight.
587 2018-12-18 22:09:31 Your point is what, exactly? I'm assuming that low-energy meme was some attempt at goading a reaction, but if you're expecting me to white knight for Trump or say the NRA should be out in the streets over bump stocks then you're going to be waiting a long time.
588 2018-12-18 22:09:31 Screw this and the bump stocks confiscation
589 2018-12-18 22:09:16 @realDonaldTrump Thank you for acting against bump stocks! Keep it up!
590 2018-12-18 22:09:05 Market Close: MBS +28bps; DOW +82.66; NASDAQ +30.18; S&P 500 +0.22; 10yr Treasury 2.82%;  Stocks and MBS rose today, as they prepare for tomorrow's FOMC Announcement, when it's expected they'll raise rates by .25%, but investors want to view what's ahead.
591 2018-12-18 22:08:36 Sure, makes perfect sense.

The Las Vegas shooter used guns modified with bump stocks, leaving 59 dead & hundreds injured.
592 2018-12-18 22:08:23 Who needs bump stocks anyways? If you cant nuetralize a target without them u shouldnt be shooting. But i see jesses point. Next will be semi auto weapons then handguns revolvers shotguns deer rifles single shot. Until they have complete control they wont stop.
593 2018-12-18 22:08:21 That's a hard comparison, b/c valuing chip stocks 5yrs ago I would argue is different now. They were more of a true commodity then. Chips/Semis have morphed in a sense that they are transitioning into growth stocks (w/ the advent of all the avenues that AI & AutoCars provide them
594 2018-12-18 22:08:06 Hey @NRA get your people to turn in their bump stocks! While its  the least @realDonaldTrump should do its still less deadly guns in the hands of you maniacs and good practice for 2020 when we take away the assault rifles!
595 2018-12-18 22:07:49 They can't even keep track of a child, how they gonna keep track of who's got bump stocks?
596 2018-12-18 22:07:42 Remember, the ATF and government reviewed bump stocks previously and did not ban them. From what I know of bump stocks, it doesn't turn the gun into an auto. Also, you don't need logic to target other modifications, just emotion.

599 2018-12-18 22:06:44 This is pretty simple and factually accurate, after trumps election stocks skyrocketed, after democrats won house stocks tanked
600 2018-12-18 22:06:32 Bump stocks are dumb to begin with= don't care
If Mexico can help with caravans/illegal immigration= ok with that
Border wall/budget= will be an issue but if he shuts down the border I'm sure he will make many people happy even without the wall
601 2018-12-18 22:06:32 Traitor in Chief. Not to mention the subversive classification of bump stocks
602 2018-12-18 22:06:24 That’s not what he said. Extrapolating the past is one of the worst ways of forecasting returns. Even in the long run. Stocks shouldn’t return what they did over the last 100 years
603 2018-12-18 22:05:55 Do you think they actually care? Eyes on stocks, they cant see you :-(
604 2018-12-18 22:05:25 Re: common fisheries policy. If it hadn't been imposed there would have been a danger that stocks would have been extinct. A larger share of nothing is nothing.
605 2018-12-18 22:05:04 Only took over a year, the bump stocks are a talking point, it's not REAL gun control.
606 2018-12-18 22:04:44 People are still putting 2 stocks in their rulesets for online. It’s gonna be 2019 in 2 weeks and people are still putting 2014 rules. Don’t even get me started on people who put hazardless stages thinking they’re gonna get PS2 or SV.
607 2018-12-18 22:04:43 Yeah, but he's also bumped good stocks. As in way down.
608 2018-12-18 22:04:15 Banned bump stocks (the only real gun control administered by an administration since the 90's), paying Mexico for no wall instead of them paying us for a wall. Yeah, he's killing it for you there.
609 2018-12-18 22:04:07 On the 7th day of Christmas the trump WH sent to me...all my stocks and assets plummeting.

EZ.
611 2018-12-18 22:03:06 They even have locates for cheaper priced stocks such as BIOC? Nice!
612 2018-12-18 22:03:01 So all you #NRA #2A fans who thought Obama was coming for your guns, what do you do now that @realDonaldTrump is taking away your bump stocks and really forcing you to fire blanks?

614 2018-12-18 22:02:55 Their is always a chance that they will lose in court. In America we sue to solve problems. I've got no problem with that. It's bump stocks for sale on the free market that I have a problem with.

2. Economy is slowing down due to the high probability of a big stock market & housing market crash so investors are cashing out and slowing down on developing their businesses so stocks are becoming cheaper and cheaper.
618 2018-12-18 22:02:34 While stocks last, but I'm not sure if the toner or the sweets will run out first 
619 2018-12-18 22:02:26 If you have bump stocks, don't give them up

622 2018-12-18 22:01:29 Just because I oppose bump stocks in my personal opinion does not mean I support the deep state.

624 2018-12-18 22:01:19 I apologise in advance didn’t realise changing my profile pic from predominately Oil would have such an impact on the price action today .

We are where we are some will panic first thing & MMs will mark stocks down but there’s always a dead cat bounce to salvage more.

625 2018-12-18 22:01:14 Hot take but banning bump stocks won't do much to stop gun violence
626 2018-12-18 22:01:06 Not a great week for @POTUS @realDonaldTrump no wall, ban on bump stocks, market sinking, former employees turning, foundations dissolved. Could really use a win before Christmas.
627 2018-12-18 22:01:05 If only I had sold my stocks when Trump first announced tariffs...
628 2018-12-18 22:01:05 Let’s ask the twitter public who they would most like to see if the stocks and messy...hopefully Your Ladies of the Manor will vote too and then they can administer your punishment in May 
629 2018-12-18 22:00:30 Ok but what if you lost all your bump stocks in a boating accident
630 2018-12-18 22:00:22 I’d low key be willing to give up bump stocks if we could flash bangs, concussion, incendiary, and frag grenades

633 2018-12-18 21:59:53 (1/N)Some interesting facts about current market situation:
1. Companies have good amount of cash on hand due to tax cuts & last 2 years econimic growth therefore higher revenue and profits
You see all companies left and right announcing stocks buy back

637 2018-12-18 21:59:18 Took all my money out the stock market today. Feels like 10,000lbs have been lifted off my shoulders. No stress lol hope to see some big stocks go to shit so maybe I can buy in. Amazon to $800 please
638 2018-12-18 21:59:15 ETF gathers so many dismantled oil stocks that when bears hit strong, tomato shows up.
639 2018-12-18 21:59:11 There’s been plenty information about this in @Independent Philip May works for Capital Group, massive US hedge fund; that’s why May aligns herself with them: it’s disaster capitalism. Look up Capital International. Hedge funds who short U.K. profit from huge fall in U.K. stocks
640 2018-12-18 21:58:55 Who the hell is buying stocks here? I get it, traders can be in and out and be nimble, as we are on a daily basis....

But, smaller investors are not going to sit around and get steamrolled again like 2008. Seen this movie before.

643 2018-12-18 21:57:54 @realDonaldTrump what's up with the Ban on bump stocks? Shall not be INFRINGED doesn't apply here? Instead you should be Banning the Mandatory fed tax stamp.
644 2018-12-18 21:57:47 The S&P 500 had risen as much as 1.1 percent earlier in the session but gave up most of its gains after U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Democrats had rejected his spending bill proposal.  

As much as 1.1 %  #dow #nasdaq #stocks #buybitcoin #bitcoin
645 2018-12-18 21:57:47 Trump stocks aren’t worth a shit today anyway!
646 2018-12-18 21:57:26 Happens every year Chris... People selling stocks and cashing profits just before the expensive X.mas days. 
On the other hand, this creates a great moment to buy or accumulate funds.
647 2018-12-18 21:57:01 .@wjrradio @newsGuy760 Your analogy comparing confiscation of bump stocks to cocaine is terrible. When was the last time cocaine was legal? Confiscated cocaine wouldn't have been purchased legally. I'm not a bump stock fan, but this uncompensated seizure is not justified.
648 2018-12-18 21:56:57 Where are all the gun control nuts today? I don’t see anyone thanking Trump for banning bump stocks.
649 2018-12-18 21:56:39 I like you and support you and could careless about bump stocks but it does not turn a semi into a.macine gun it's still a semi.
650 2018-12-18 21:55:54 Since ObamaCare passed 2010,health care stocks have tripled, secondary to Medicaid expansion and to a less extent individual  insurance growth. ObamaCare created new customers for selling insurance, hospital beds, medical, devices, and new drugs.
651 2018-12-18 21:55:53 You wonder why health insurance companies stocks skyrocketed when this got passed...
652 2018-12-18 21:55:44 wrong. stocks slammed on mnuchin blaab.
653 2018-12-18 21:55:43 I’m a huge 2A supporter...but banning bump stocks doesn’t bother me one bit. If you’ve ever tried to hit something with 5+ rounds accurately with one, you probably understand why.
654 2018-12-18 21:55:36 $SPY While I'm reading standard bearish closing comments on the market and I get that; I continue to see some sweet setups on select stocks!
655 2018-12-18 21:55:35 For weeks almost half the #rubicoin team has been working hard on something new for our valued community of subscribers.

656 2018-12-18 21:55:13 I thought Chris C.  (last name rhymes with giovacco)  didn't do individual stocks
657 2018-12-18 21:54:50 And handguns will kill 34,000 more people next year. However it’s in inner cities mostly so white people....don’t worry! I disagree with bump stocks but if a shoelace/rubber band can bumpfire, or shaving a pin...idk what effect this has other then causing a debate.
658 2018-12-18 21:54:29 Looks like $HARV.C and $GTII.C and $CL.C won dispensaries in PA with Harvest and GTI really cleaning up.  Stocks are down so go figure.  With NJ licensing increasing, its shocking that ancillary cos as well as winners don't get value uplift from new paradigms/opps.
659 2018-12-18 21:54:15 Why ban bump stocks????
660 2018-12-18 21:53:57 Bank Stocks seem to be going low
661 2018-12-18 21:53:42 Mr. President, beautiful photo!

I wish you and your family a safe and wonderful holiday!

As a life long Republican and supporter of your campaign and voter I applaud your actions to date!

Please reconsider your proposed actions with the ATF regarding bump stocks!

666 2018-12-18 21:53:11 Come on guys is there any mention about your  stocks poor performance? Lol its 57 cents
667 2018-12-18 21:53:06 #By Amy Caren Daniel. (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Tuesday, helped by technology stocks, upbeat earnings reports | @sandiplimbachia
668 2018-12-18 21:52:57 tomorrow is a key day for stocks when Federal Reserve announces their decision on interest rate increases...stock market is anticipating they will be Nice...if they are Naughty, stocks will get spanked
669 2018-12-18 21:52:54 The new DOJ ruling says that bump stocks "allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.”

This is factually incorrect. Bump firing a semi-automatic firearms requires one trigger pull per round.
670 2018-12-18 21:52:34 If the Trump administration has the power to prosecute people for not turning in their bump stocks, what’s to prevent future administrations from prosecuting individuals for owning physical gold and silver?
671 2018-12-18 21:52:31 Thanks bro 
672 2018-12-18 21:52:25 I just wanted to clear it up that what you said is moronic. Now that we cleared that up we can get back to trading and you can get back to only buying .0001 stocks so no one has the advantage over you! Trading 101!! Lmaoooooooo
673 2018-12-18 21:51:25 Thanks, @NRA and @realDonaldTrump for letting the BATF seize bump stocks.

It makes those decades of NRA fundraising letters bitching about BATF excesses and how they need to be reigned in totally worth it.
674 2018-12-18 21:51:17 So bump stocks - pick one remember. The BioShock has been used in one shooting, it is one of a hundred ways to increase the rate of fire - including using your finger. It didn't stop anything and most likely wont. So now what about all the other ways, ban them too?
675 2018-12-18 21:51:07 Trump: "what do my supporters want"
Trump supporters: "Build the wall and protect the constitution!"
Trump: *appeals to liberals, bans bump stocks and doesnt build the wall*
Trump is going to lose in 2020
676 2018-12-18 21:51:04 The amount of misinformation about gun laws/bump stocks on @wccoradio with @JordanaWCCO @pdouglasweather is staggering.
677 2018-12-18 21:50:58 Tell me was it the liberals that took away your bump stocks today?
678 2018-12-18 21:50:37 "Machine Guns" have belt-fed ammunition.  Bump stocks do not allow your rifle to be belt-fed, so this is nonsense.
679 2018-12-18 21:50:35 Got 3 stocks to get deleted? :/
680 2018-12-18 21:50:24 People will have to turn in their bump stocks to the ATF, billions of dollars are being sent to Mexico, and the wall is all but officially scrapped. Kek. Trump is not doing a good job at all.
681 2018-12-18 21:50:19 The economy is strong right now. This is the best time to deal with the unfair trade. You have no idea this will help us all.  The interest rate hike is one big reason why stocks plummet. People sell more. Bit in the end it will come up.
682 2018-12-18 21:50:08 @realDonaldTrump WTF dude, you're banning bump stocks!?

There also needs to be recusial oversight so SCJ don't hear conflict of interest for them matters and no investing in individual stocks during SC tenure.
We need a SC that represents the people not the wealthy.

687 2018-12-18 21:48:48 They finally banned bump stocks but a dual trigger is more effective anyways
688 2018-12-18 21:48:04 The Bump Stock Ban

1. Makes owners felons after 90 days.

2. Will not prevent the use of bump stocks in violent crime.

3. It is an infringement on the right to bear arms.

4. My trigger finger is still faster and more accurate.
689 2018-12-18 21:47:55 if the news is true, and trump admin is moving to ban bump stocks, this could be trumps plan to test out the supreme court, unless its a actual pander to the left who want limitations on who gets what in terms of self defense.
690 2018-12-18 21:47:43 Since bump stocks seem to be designed to meet the "function of the trigger" requirement, I can imagine the NRA or a manufacturer arguing that the ATF can't just decide on a different meaning of the word.
691 2018-12-18 21:47:39 @NRA If NRA does NOT stand up to Trump's tyranny in banning bump stocks, I'll not be renewing my NRA membership again ever.
692 2018-12-18 21:47:35 Anytime you hear somebody in D.C. say banning bump stocks will make America safer - write them off as a politician giving into anti-gun hysteria.

693 2018-12-18 21:47:15 Well weve already talked about better mental health checks, but for the second point getting rid of bump stocks or high capacity magazines would help bring down the number of people someone can kill in one go. A bump stock basically turns a semi-auto into an automatic
694 2018-12-18 21:46:54 I'm not sure stocks are good for one's mental health as they could induce anxiety.
695 2018-12-18 21:46:50 Tough luck. Yep definitely trade less & take high quality setups.! Tune out the noise & focus on fewer stocks will also help.  Im sure you'll turn it around . Good luck

697 2018-12-18 21:45:54 While I agree, bump stocks are for  people that can't shoot.
698 2018-12-18 21:45:27 Where did the stocks come from?
699 2018-12-18 21:45:06 I wouldn't advise something like that, but hey I think Canadian stocks will get hit from multiple angles next year so you're olright on direction
700 2018-12-18 21:44:51 What is the penalty for not turning in or destroying your bump stocks??

@NRA
701 2018-12-18 21:44:48 Bout to take two bump stocks and make some nunchucks
702 2018-12-18 21:44:44 It is not under atf jurisdiction. Keep ur bump stocks.
703 2018-12-18 21:44:27 Provide citation of source else it's just more fake news. #MAGA Trump just banned bump stocks, guess it wasn't Obama coming for your guns afterall
704 2018-12-18 21:44:14 Bump stocks, which utilizes the reactive recoil of a fired semi-auto rifle to mimic a full-auto rifle, was designed for people w/ physical disabilities. As is, bump stocks causes weapons to fire indiscriminately, w/ no aiming accuracy. They are not the problem; criminals are!
705 2018-12-18 21:44:05 Well you arm yourself against the government and it’s arsenal with those bump stocks and let me know how it turns out for you... or I’ll just wait for the Yokel Dies After 3 Minute War Against Government headline
706 2018-12-18 21:43:42 apple stocks rise by 10%.
707 2018-12-18 21:43:40 Bump stocks are not the problem. How many bump stocks have been used by children to kill children? How many have been used in domestic violence? In urban violence? Bump stocks are not the problem. Americans with guns are the problem. Guns are the problem.

709 2018-12-18 21:43:03 @realDonaldTrump ban bump stocks without opening up the machine gun registry to get them registered? #YouSuckAtYourJob
710 2018-12-18 21:42:52 Bump stocks were banned today by the Justice Department, via a new regulation signed by acting AG Whittaker no less.  

"Current bump stock owners will have the 90 days before the new rule takes effect to either destroy the devices they own or turn them in..." - via @NPR
711 2018-12-18 21:42:50 in the end, if you're opposed to bump stocks, you can't argue against them without pretending they're commonly used for crime or responsible for 40K deaths?
712 2018-12-18 21:42:48 In all reality more people in Las Vegas would have died in that shooting had the guy not used bump stocks. Bump stock fire is very inaccurate. He would’ve done much more damage by aiming properly in that same amount of time.
713 2018-12-18 21:42:41 Bump stocks are so colossally inaccurate as to be nothing but an enormous waste of ammo.

Big whoop.
714 2018-12-18 21:42:33 The stock market has been manipulated ever since computers started being used to buy stocks. Computers buy and sell millions of dollars of stocks in the blink of an eye. Programs running across the globe buying and selling stocks on their own, with very little human intervention.
715 2018-12-18 21:42:27 .@sullivanradio The only advantage to bump stocks is rate of fire. They may be fun to shoot, but you lose accuracy, so they aren't any good for hunting or self defense.
There should however be compensation for the taking of any item that was purchased legally.
716 2018-12-18 21:42:12 wow short stocks much? haha
717 2018-12-18 21:41:02 Slippery slopes work both ways.  Bump stocks have always been a blatant attempt to circumvent the machine gun ban and now that loophole has been closed.

725 2018-12-18 21:39:36 Personally, I don't care about the bump stock itself because it's a dumb gimmick, but that's not the point. The point is that the left knows damn well to incrementally erode what they don't like. Caving on the stupid bump stocks moves the goalpost to something that may matter.
726 2018-12-18 21:39:18 Bump stocks were used on one mass shooting out of hundreds in the US. Not even a drop in the pond, but sure looks good to dumbass Americans looking for Trump brownie points. SMH

743 2018-12-18 21:34:31 @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks do NOT turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns. This was a horrible decision and will do NOTHING to stop mass shootings.

745 2018-12-18 21:34:16 The move to get rid of bump stocks was a good move. I only feel this way because it modified a weapon to simulate a weapon already illegal. I’m sure they are fun to shoot, but being legal just left too much open to be attacked by gun grabbers.

All this feel good law does is make legal  gun owners into Felons. Do some good and go to the inner cities and cut crime!

Know Your Customer! Then, sunlight will be the best disinfectant! No foreigners can buy political ads. Viola!
763 2018-12-18 21:29:25 So no power to build wall like promised but no problem outlawing bump stocks.
764 2018-12-18 21:29:21 I agree here. Bump stocks are silly and ineffective. I am saddened to see such virtue signaling tripe from @POTUS . I would prefer we were all given the truth about Las Vegas, instead of this meaningless attack on gun owners.
765 2018-12-18 21:29:18 It's the common ruleset thanks to the gamespeed being a lot faster now. Smash 4 was a bit slower, but overall 2 stocks makes comebacks and disadvantage more frustrating when you lose an early stock and are already at 1.
766 2018-12-18 21:29:11 You just lost a lot of votes banning bump stocks.
767 2018-12-18 21:29:10 Today's news includes a story about bump stocks being ruled illegal while nunchucks are ruled protected by the 2nd amendment and all I can imagine is a bunch of gun owners protecting their gun lockers from the feds with nunchucks
768 2018-12-18 21:28:54 @realDonaldTrump if you actually think people are going to turn in bump stocks you are on drugs!
769 2018-12-18 21:28:22 Bump stocks allow for the weapon to use it's own recoil to fire in a rather repetitious manner in a short span. I'm a mech eng, so don't try to slip things past me.

773 2018-12-18 21:27:47 .@wjrradio @newsGuy760 Will the new regulation banning ownership of bump stocks compensate current owners? Are they buying back these items like Australia did? If they were purchased legally, why can the govt cause an economic loss? Its an unfunded mandate.
774 2018-12-18 21:27:40 Today, the Department of Justice announced a federal regulation banning bump stocks. We are currently reviewing the details of the new rule to see how it could impact our local ban enacted last May, along with the ensuing litigation brought by the gun lobby. However, we see (1/2)
775 2018-12-18 21:27:23 And the plan for getting the bump stocks that aren't destroyed or turned in is ???
776 2018-12-18 21:27:13 Leave it to an @GOP administration! Stocks on track for worst December since the Great Depression! The Dow and S&P 500 are both in the red for the year, putting stocks on track to have their worst annual loss since the 2008 Great Recession! @realDonaldTrump has no clue!
777 2018-12-18 21:27:12 Trump Administration To Ban Bump Stocks, Similar Devices That Mimic Machine Guns
778 2018-12-18 21:26:57 Trump just got rid of Bump stocks effective next year. I’m ok with that personally, feels like if automatic weapons are not allowed then this shouldn’t be either.
779 2018-12-18 21:26:48 I need more associates that know about stocks.
780 2018-12-18 21:26:45 We’re heading for a bear market in stocks?
781 2018-12-18 21:26:37 You made the smart move.
782 2018-12-18 21:26:37 Well I guess it took a 45% decline for Ross Gerber to sell "social Media" stocks. IE., $FB.  Doubt "Russia" was the reason but the "Decline"
783 2018-12-18 21:26:23 No. Better mental health, ban automatic weapons, ban high capacity magazines, ban bump stocks, close gun show loophole and implement common sense background checks.
784 2018-12-18 21:26:07 Hopefully back pain is covered in the repeal of the ACA, Republicans are tying themselves in knots today regarding Trump banning bump stocks, they are going to need to see an Orthopedist.
785 2018-12-18 21:25:50 Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein on proposed bump stock ban by Trump admin:
"We see this as a positive step, and it helps bolster our argument that bump stocks can and should be regulated to make our communities safer”
786 2018-12-18 21:25:42 World stocks flat to lower: Europe-.8%; US flat. Yet another volatile day with markets disappointing investors. Even bargain hunters couldn’t drive the broad market higher as there is little confidence we’re near bottom. Interest-rates & oil prices sending message of slowdown.
787 2018-12-18 21:25:33 However.... if bump stocks are already commonly used, and bump stocks are “machine guns”, maybe there’s a means to wipe out the NFA using the common clause.

790 2018-12-18 21:25:09 Oh. That’s so intelligent. NOT. just because he got a 30 million dollar donation from them he is siding with them. Bump stocks are not the problem!!!!!!
791 2018-12-18 21:24:54 Are talking about bump stocks?
792 2018-12-18 21:24:50 @realDonaldTrump Great job on banning bump stocks. You’re still going to prison and this will have no bearing on that but this was a good thing you did.  #BenedictDonald
793 2018-12-18 21:24:32 @WhiteHouse You are not suppose to support the ban on bump stocks. By doing this, you are opening the door wide open to ban gun. You were elected to protect our 2nd Amendment and you are now stepping all over it.
794 2018-12-18 21:24:17 I don’t know which stock has dipped more, the stock market or bump stocks into lakes due to “boating accidents”
795 2018-12-18 21:24:11 He needs putting in stocks
796 2018-12-18 21:24:06 Bump stocks are just a "shiny object" the #GOPComplicit have been keeping in their back pockets for over a year (ever since Vegas).

We only see it now because of the bad publicity from #Trump's "Checkbook Charity".
797 2018-12-18 21:23:59 The Trump administration banned bump stocks today and I’m yet to see anyone say a word about it. What are people gonna pretend to care about next?
798 2018-12-18 21:23:54 Bump stocks sales going up til then
799 2018-12-18 21:23:51 @realDonaldTrump You are not suppose to support the ban on bump stocks. By doing this, you are opening the door wide open to ban gun. You were elected to protect our 2nd Amendment and you are now stepping all over it.
800 2018-12-18 21:23:34 Loser it’s 3 stocks you dumb bitch
801 2018-12-18 21:22:48 Bump stocks suck, but that doesn't mean that you should not have the right to own one. Consider this. In the context of the Constitution, the NFA is illegal itself.
802 2018-12-18 21:22:42 This is not a joke folks, stock up while stocks last! After March, there will need to be a "Plan B" if you know what I mean....
803 2018-12-18 21:22:39 Now that Trump is against the wall; He’s releasing the children from the camps & Banning Bun Stocks
804 2018-12-18 21:22:15 @realDonaldTrump wow you caved pretty quick to the Democrats on those bump stocks
805 2018-12-18 21:22:15 Since they just announced the ban on bump stocks, Trump is holding this conference in an attempt to appease the NRA. 
806 2018-12-18 21:22:10 “Bump stocks are being banned!?! WTF!?!  This is bullshit!  How am I supposed to defend my family or put food on the table?,” declares unemployed, shitty marksman.
807 2018-12-18 21:22:08 Well if nothing else perhaps we can now capture actual data on before and after bump stocks.
808 2018-12-18 21:21:56 Holy cow Steve Wynn and Adelson lose again.stocks down on Wynn in Macau.Trump must be shitting bricks.
809 2018-12-18 21:21:55 Trump Stocks. He thought he was confiscating all the Trump Stocks.
810 2018-12-18 21:21:50 If bump stocks had been used in a mass shooting during the Obama admin, you might have a point. As it is, though....
811 2018-12-18 21:21:48 In smash 4 I got max aura on 35~40% 1 stock and anyone 3. If 2 person is out of stocks it dropped from 2 behind to 2 ahead. Didn't mater who died. If its the same~ish in ult then having 3 stocks and someone is death is better then, your teammate 3 and you 2 + 1 death

826 2018-12-18 21:18:55 So after the daily beast confronted Inhofe, he denied knowledge of the stocks purchase, claiming it was conducted by a portfolion manager. He subsequently reversed the transaction, probably out of fear of persecution. Something tells me that he was not unaware of this transaction
827 2018-12-18 21:18:30 Why bc thats what enabled all those people to get shot? Vegas massacre was a cover up, multiple shootings in multiple places (not reported) , multiple shooters on the ground(not reported)...major cover up of actual events, bump stocks had nothing to do w it.
828 2018-12-18 21:18:26 Biotech unwind his been absolutely brutal. Some of the stocks trading at levels that would have been hard to imagine 6 months ago or so.

830 2018-12-18 21:18:19 Bump stocks should have never been made legal. Good move to ban them.
831 2018-12-18 21:18:05 Gotta get tough on em. 5 years jail or better still stocks in town centre
832 2018-12-18 21:18:01 Trump Administration Bans Bump Stocks, Says They're Equal to Machine Guns
833 2018-12-18 21:17:58 I am pleased to see bump stocks taken out of commerce, but this small a step so long, after so many tragedies, simply is not enough. 

In the new Congress, my colleagues and I will continue fighting for strong, tangible steps to combat the scourge of gun violence.

Might start seizing those first.

Jobs??? Layoffs!!!! He is SOOOOO. Great!!!!!!!
839 2018-12-18 21:16:18 The real gem here though? That it's going to turn some of his gun-rabid base against him, and we get the ban on bump stocks which is good for humanity, and there's zero chance people who hate him will start loving him for this. Wins all around.
840 2018-12-18 21:16:08 Bump stocks, used to make semi-automatic rifles fire in rapid bursts, are now illegal and owners have 90 days to dispose of them.
841 2018-12-18 21:16:05 Trump Set to Ban ‘Bump Stocks’
842 2018-12-18 21:16:01 Trump fulfills longtime pledge to ban bump stocks
843 2018-12-18 21:15:56 State Senator Julie Morrison issued the following statement this afternoon after news that the U.S. Justice Department is banning bump stocks. Bump stocks are attachments used to increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons.
844 2018-12-18 21:15:40 Moving into dgi stocks after the market tanks a little more?
845 2018-12-18 21:15:39 How’s anyone going to know until I bring it out in public? (I’m not planning to do this, but as a thought experiment, do you see how impotent this law is going to be to stop motivated spree shooters from making and using their own bump stocks?)
846 2018-12-18 21:15:37 Gotta get my self outfitted to make "bump stocks" out of a piece of pipe for when that rolls around. 

Turns out I'd have hundreds and hundreds that I'd need to sell back.
847 2018-12-18 21:15:19 He’s either too dumb or to lazy to figure out there are other ways to achieve the same thing you can with bump stocks
848 2018-12-18 21:15:18 Fake news! Bump stocks don’t turn semi-automatics into automatics.
849 2018-12-18 21:15:10 Honest question, no sarcasm.
What right is being violated from getting rid of bump stocks? There's still a right to bear arms. The 2A, as far as I know, doesn't cover the right to gun accessories.
850 2018-12-18 21:15:06 looks like stocks gonna bite the dust
851 2018-12-18 21:14:58 Lots of people complain about FAANG companies but I think it has been the insanity of the semi stocks that has really inflated this tech bubble.
852 2018-12-18 21:14:55 The whole focus on bump stocks is misdirection.
Any semi-auto can be made to shoot at 'full-auto' rates of fire with a little practice.
853 2018-12-18 21:14:45 How tf are bump stocks a basic right?
854 2018-12-18 21:14:33 What would universal background checks do? The Vegas shooter, who used bump stocks btw, legally bought all his weapons and passed all background checks. Same with the guy who shot up that club in Florida and the guy who shot all those cops in Dallas.
855 2018-12-18 21:13:47 I'm guessing a lot of bump stocks will be "Stolen" right out from under their upstanding owners in the next 90 days.
856 2018-12-18 21:13:39 A2: March for our lives has the greatest momentum of any of the recent social movements. If large changes are to happen in the next 5 years, it will depend on which political party is in power. However, we could see smaller legislation like bans of bump stocks in the future.
857 2018-12-18 21:13:37 Thx for not letting these moronic idiots stop u doing ur amazing job. 5 min jail sentence for anyone who assaults ambulance or any nhs staff. Or the stocks in town centre with name and shame tag. Most of us love and respect u all.
858 2018-12-18 21:13:37 stocks rise by 1%.
859 2018-12-18 21:13:20 @realDonaldTrump @nra congrats, you both just turned the justice department into thieves. I hope everyone resists your attempt to confiscate bump stocks. How about you step down you thief, and the NRA can go blow goats. NRA likes getting taking it up the arse by the left.
860 2018-12-18 21:13:12 I'm both a supporter and a 2A advocate but I am ok with outlawing bump stocks.
861 2018-12-18 21:12:59 Trump actually found the political will to ban bump stocks. Finally. Just goes to show, sometimes even a blind squirrel finds a nut.
862 2018-12-18 21:12:53 Things like better mental health checks, getting rid of bump stocks or high capacity magazines, longer waiting periods and maybe raising the age to 21
863 2018-12-18 21:12:50 Okay Frank, hope you have a great rest of your week! I hope the stocks turn around too..
864 2018-12-18 21:12:42 It’s about shorting stocks - read the article on FT about Odey - he was literally considered off the wall for suggesting short - then mysteriously backs brexit & it wins now he’s laughing His ass off.
Business is not some continuum of opinion
865 2018-12-18 21:12:35 Shouldn’t lower oil prices result in higher volume throughout for pipelines? Higher volumes = more revenue. Price action in MLP stocks is nonsensical. What am I missing @MLPguy?
866 2018-12-18 21:12:30 Please explain "reasonable".  Shnyda, I used to support gun control until I found out the motivation behind it.  Do you think the federal government will stop at bump stocks, limit magazines, or evil looking AR? I line has to be drawn.
867 2018-12-18 21:12:08 t's a great day! BUMP STOCKS are now illegal, and the TRUMP FOUNDATION will be dissolved. Apparently, its main beneficiary was ... the Trump campaign.
868 2018-12-18 21:11:59 No problem with the banning of bump stocks. They are fun toys but in reality they are rather dangerous in their own right, even if you don't consider them to be simulating an automatic weapon.
869 2018-12-18 21:11:36 President Trump just outlawed bump stocks. This is the first politician to outlaw an accessory. I'm sure most Republicans agree that this is a reasonable action necessary to reduce such catastrophies from happening again. This does not affect the second amendment. Bravo Trump
870 2018-12-18 21:11:20 The FED raise, priced into banks stocks? Interested to see if they are after the fact .. #cheers
871 2018-12-18 21:11:16 $HKEB keep watch tomorrow bid .30 eod ask still .45 but a thin one .  OS under 1 mil....  87% held I believe which is nuts for a Chinese shell thats trading so low.  I believe they had other stocks with similar business go to high dollars. I think one touched $6.00
872 2018-12-18 21:10:51 lets get all the world investment moguls together in like @jpmorgan @GoldmanSachs @DeloitteUS @MoodysAnalytics about those stocks and see how many investment managers have gym memberships they pay but dont use that could be recycled in to doing good rather than "man shit"
873 2018-12-18 21:10:19 He banned bump stocks
874 2018-12-18 21:10:11 Can't wait until my Walmart stocks those. We are still sitting on a handful of alundra and Razor
875 2018-12-18 21:10:09 As to why they haven’t done the split, I imagine the 40% fall in share price caught them by surprise and didn’t want to bring it to single digits. Who knows. I am not a big proponent of splits in any case for non retail-oriented stocks. They don’t do much for institutions.
876 2018-12-18 21:10:08 Late rally lifts most stock indexes out of red, but they still close well below highs reached early in session.

After Mon. plunge, Dow ends +82, +0.4% to 23,675.
S&P +0.01%, Nasdaq +0.4%.

But losers top winners 8/7 on NYSE, 3/2 on Nasdaq

Energy stocks dive with oil prices.
877 2018-12-18 21:09:56 And 3 years from now, all these same companies will be issuing new equity (at severely depressed valuations) to repay the debt they borrowed to buy their stocks at peak valuations.
878 2018-12-18 21:09:55 Today the Trump Administration rolled out regulations on bump stocks. @ClaytonNeville tells @newsGuy760 everything we need to know about the new regulations. Was this needed? Guy wants you to share your thoughts by calling 1-800-859-0WJR (0957).
879 2018-12-18 21:09:26 Trump supporters: "Trump is a champion of liberty who will save the 2A!"
Trump: *bans bump stocks anyway*
880 2018-12-18 21:09:09 No bump stocks- so much harder for nut jobs to kill people !
881 2018-12-18 21:09:07 You have been calling for oil to be 100 at year end and gold to be at 5000
You also called for dollar to be way down and foreign stocks up.

Wrong all around.
You have no shame

People who invest with you are doomed
882 2018-12-18 21:09:03 Damn rn would be a good time to buy stocks. buy low sell high
883 2018-12-18 21:09:01 Shd be put in the city centre stocks. This is what comes of softly softly approach & as it's theft I'd birch the scumbag & she wd be silly to repeat the theft. Tough love. Embarrassment in front of all her peers & pain also. Either that or jail.
884 2018-12-18 21:08:56 "Bump stocks"??? I never bought any. No dividends and no growth potential.
885 2018-12-18 21:08:44 Presidente Trunp prohibiría el uso de los bump stocks  "accesorios que sirven para que un arma dispare a mayor velocidad".
886 2018-12-18 21:08:13 What? Banning bump stocks, 1000's of minors in custody  to be released to family members, backing down on wall funds, closing Trump foundation, judge wants time for Flynn all today! Is the only bad news today Penny Marshall?
887 2018-12-18 21:08:13 Falling stock market is simply a result of uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariffs and a trade war. 

Repeal the tariffs tomorrow and stocks start going back up.
888 2018-12-18 21:08:04 Bump stocks are gone 
      
889 2018-12-18 21:08:00 Gimme my stocks back
890 2018-12-18 21:07:48 How many TRILLIONS of $$$ have your idiotic tariffs cost our country and millions of investment accounts? 

401K decimated. 

Stocks market declines not seen since the great depression. 

Retirement savings blown away.

Resign!
891 2018-12-18 21:07:44 @realDonaldTrump So you caved again on the wall and then announced a ban on bump stocks to appease gun grabbing democrats. And I voted for you why? And you expect me to do so again why?
892 2018-12-18 21:07:40 Well I mean I would think they would care to capitalize on the bigger shopping season of the year by offering ample stocks and great deals... But guess they care more about profits at this stage
893 2018-12-18 21:07:25 When they come in with the bullets, you prepared with the bomb. So fuck bein violent, get stocks and bonds
894 2018-12-18 21:07:14 Stocks typically remain relatively stable, otherwise people would not put their retirement funds in them and the GOP would not want to invest Social Security money in them. 
Dude, none of us are getting a tax break. Only the wealthy. 
Trump lies. Every day.
895 2018-12-18 21:06:38 US stocks closed marginally in positive territory on the day: $DJIA +83, $SPX +0
896 2018-12-18 21:06:35 Les mots stocks et approvisionnement je peux plus me les voir 
897 2018-12-18 21:06:28 US stocks closed marginally in positive territory on the day: $DJIA +83, $SPX +0
898 2018-12-18 21:06:01 So only crazies and criminals will keep their bump stocks? Duly noted.
899 2018-12-18 21:05:55 Hope so genuinely but I think your pissing in the wind, he wants titles and champions leagues. his stocks high I don’t think he could turn it down
900 2018-12-18 21:05:55 Good news!!! Bump stocks are now illegal to use and illegal to own, all bump stops must be turned into the authorities within 90 days !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
901 2018-12-18 21:05:43 I thought all they wanted was bump stocks?

Where’s the compromise, we were going to trade for national carry reciprocity.

I guess they only like “national” when it’s tied to socialism.
#gunsense #RegressiveLeft
902 2018-12-18 21:05:25 The Latest on the Trump administration's move to ban bump stocks (all times local):
903 2018-12-18 21:05:05 Stocks end slide. The Dow closed at 23,675.64, up 82.66 (+0.35%). Nasdaq +0.45%. S&P +0.01%.
904 2018-12-18 21:03:50 Giving credit where credit is due; trump administration has just officially banned bump stocks. It’s a step in the right direction! 
905 2018-12-18 21:03:38 Someone needs to stop looking to the FED to prop up stocks. Not their job. RAISE THOSE RATES BOYS !!!! STOP INFLATION!! REWARD WISE SAVERS NOT FOOLISH INVESTORS
906 2018-12-18 21:03:04 That’s unlikely, I agree. But a significant drawdown from here is still possible. Much of the sentiment around stocks, resembles that of crypto investors in the early stages of the crash in crypto prices.
907 2018-12-18 21:02:50 Yeah but your ceo Kirk sucks as a ceo.. vote him out.. his stocks at all time lows!
908 2018-12-18 21:02:46 There is a reason Trump is fighting with the FED over the interest rate increases. That is one of the most powerful triggers. And it looks like they want to get rid of him. The rest of the world is getting rid of the USD. So USD or US stockS except a few exceptions. Insane. 2/2
909 2018-12-18 21:02:43 US #Stocks end up in the green after another volatile trading session

Dow +0.35%
S&P500 +0.01%
Nasdaq +0.45%
910 2018-12-18 21:02:18 Trump banned Bump Stocks today. Thank you, Mr. President. Doesn’t change what I think about you. One good deed does not absolve threatening the rule of law and separating migrant children, among other sins.
911 2018-12-18 21:02:15 However, in spite of currently posting year-to-date losses between 75% and 90%, the leading cryptocurrency markets have significantly outperformed the FANG stocks since the start of 2017.
912 2018-12-18 21:02:07 I moved quite a bit early on the big recession- pleased with myself. But I missed probably 50% of the gain worried about a double dip. My best friend let it ride, fully in stocks.   We were both back to neutral about the same time.
913 2018-12-18 21:01:57 As with the cryptocurrency markets, the FANG stocks broke into new record highs during early 2017, leading to a multi-month bull trend driven by accelerated momentum.
914 2018-12-18 21:01:56 Anyone looking to turn in your bump stocks, let me know, I will do it for ya
915 2018-12-18 21:01:50 I figure psycho cops would be all over getting to have bump stocks.
916 2018-12-18 21:01:49 Will probably scream again if found that Parliament stocks Milkybars 
917 2018-12-18 21:01:47 The creeping, incremental incursions on civil rights in the name of 'safety.'

I don't even care abt bump stocks but I would like to abolish the ATF.
918 2018-12-18 21:01:34 It violates the 2nd, Heller, Malooney and more but who cares. Bump stocks were a gimmick that drove the Left nuts, now the left will show their real purpose, ban all guns since they don't have that whipping post anymore.

920 2018-12-18 21:01:22 Despite the 2018 cryptocurrency bear trend renewing gleeful predictions of bitcoin’s demise from mainstream financial analysts, the leading crypto markets have dramatically outperformed the ‘FANG’ (Facebook, Apple, Netflix, and Google) stocks since the start of 2017.
921 2018-12-18 21:01:20 Bump stocks don't take away guns. Just something that can make a semi-automatic rifle more like an automatic.
922 2018-12-18 21:01:01 You're right. Cars kill significantly more people per year than bump stocks.
923 2018-12-18 21:00:55 Long term is the only way to on $vrus It's one of those stocks that can be a game changer in life, if  you got any sense about this stock on how it will roll.
924 2018-12-18 21:00:52 The president just banned bump stocks. And you will have to turn any you have over in 90 days to the gov once it goes into effect. Funny you not talking about that?

926 2018-12-18 21:00:38 Yes... maybe that’s why all the Hail Mary passes today. Granting a visa to the mother of the dying boy in California, banning bump stocks . He’s hanging on for dear life. Literally !
927 2018-12-18 21:00:14 The #StockMarket just had its worst December start since 1980, but income investors have little to worry about. Whether Santa Claus comes to #WallStreet or not, solid dividend stocks will keep mailing out checks. ~ Jing Pan, Income Investors
928 2018-12-18 21:00:09 No, your missing the point! The point is the market is like craps. You put your money in and hope the stocks make money. Some folded and lost money and some made money. There is no guarantee you are going to make money. To state that is lying. OK to gamble if you can take outcome
929 2018-12-18 21:00:04 Imagine if Obama tried to take away bump-stocks.......

932 2018-12-18 20:59:53 Banning bump stocks is a good first step, but outlawing these mass killing devices doesn't deserve a pat on the back. 

Americans across the country want Congress to act on gun violence and come January they are going to see us get to work.
933 2018-12-18 20:59:33 Just keep walking... It’s called buy, sell, stocks on his game... not mine. I was born this way...
934 2018-12-18 20:59:07 They should bring back the stocks! Put the guy filming outside the NFfc v DCfc game and let everyone humiliate him!! Lesson learned then hopefully!
935 2018-12-18 20:59:06 Skadi declares that people imprisoned in stocks offends her goddess. The guards leg it as Skadi ignites the lightsabre. People starved in stocks for 2-3 days. The Burgerking has been elevated to the priority smiting list. #DNDHIB
936 2018-12-18 20:59:06 Are you an Idahoan who owns a bump stock? Would love to hear from you today on the Justice Department's intent to ban bump stocks and what you plan to do with yours. DM me or email heathdruzin@boisestate.edu
937 2018-12-18 20:58:58 The ATF themselves said that bump stocks were accessories and not firearms and therefore outside of their scope to regulate. Courts will handle it now.

940 2018-12-18 20:58:26 Thanks Trump.  So glad that I'm poor and don't have stocks/401K
941 2018-12-18 20:57:49 and he's banning bump stocks
942 2018-12-18 20:57:40 busy buying stocks today for potential dead meat bounce in Q1 2019
943 2018-12-18 20:57:33 What a good day so far: Flynn got blinded in court. Sanders had her tail between her legs at a press briefing. Trump dissolved his “charity”. Bump stocks banned. #resisters are sharing taco recipes and I’m done all my house cleaning for the day. lots of love fellow #democrats
944 2018-12-18 20:57:29 With all the bombs dropping today, Flynn pleading guilty, bump stocks being banned, Trump Foundation closing, and, the closure of the Tornillo camp, a logical person would think #qanon is just a big stupid joke.
945 2018-12-18 20:56:58 Triple geared chocolate fondu consumer staple stocks. Long.
946 2018-12-18 20:56:50 Even though I'm up in pot stocks still...having given back about 1/4 of the 2/3s remining in YTD losses in them over past month or so.  other losses of what is left are stocks dipping after great runs, which i still think may have a good bounce in 2019.  i hope.
947 2018-12-18 20:56:44 all those deluded folks who piled into fracking stocks are getting fracked.  serves them right...
948 2018-12-18 20:56:42 I never said I was stopping there. I support bans on extended mags, armor-piercing bullets, and bump stocks, bans on convicted felons and domestic abusers from buying guns, nationwide background checks, mandatory gun safety courses, and increased mental health funding.
949 2018-12-18 20:56:40 People are really lightening up on Cdn Banks even though they're pumping them on the business channels.  If they're up when the market is +200 points then fall with them market, but the market recovers & the stocks stay down...you're in BIG trouble. Tmrw another day & episode lol
950 2018-12-18 20:56:22 Maybe it’s because he’s going to balk on the wall!!! And the to kick us in the gut ban bump stocks... #A2 #slipperyslope @realDonaldTrump #losingbase #fraudTrump tbd
951 2018-12-18 20:56:13 Bump stocks generally make your rifle less effective in combat or for killing people or whatever.  They are just a novelty so people can shoot really fast and have some fun.  

Banning them accomplishes nothing except infringe in the 2a.
952 2018-12-18 20:56:05 This is an easy deal for @realDonaldTrump & the @SenateGOP @HouseGOP & @NRA. No major weapons manufacturers make bump stocks. The NRA’s rulers aren’t affected and so the Republicans aren’t going to lose $ from this. No bump stocks were used in school shootings.
953 2018-12-18 20:55:26 Does it matter?  Bump stocks are basically useless toys, the border wall can be funded through DOD, and the Trump Organization is not important for anything that matters to us.
954 2018-12-18 20:55:18 Out of 1,000 people who currently invest online in traditional products like stocks, over 400 – 44% – people cited a lack of good educational resources as a reason they didn’t want to invest in cryptocurrency.
955 2018-12-18 20:55:14 @sleepyat830 asking the best legal mind on Twitter. Does the bump stock ban illegalizing current stocks not run afoul of ex post facto restrictions?
956 2018-12-18 20:55:13 Curt Miller vs. Amber Stocks was legendary.
957 2018-12-18 20:54:59 Then why do stocks go down if they are making all this money? Shale is a farce.
958 2018-12-18 20:54:45 Romans and Saxons coming over here, taking our round-houses, using up all the stocks of medicinal herbs....
959 2018-12-18 20:54:40 US stocks now live?? 
960 2018-12-18 20:54:34 thanks for banning bump stocks you retard
961 2018-12-18 20:54:13 No language about bump stocks in 2A
962 2018-12-18 20:54:11 Bumps stocks are stupid and worthless.
963 2018-12-18 20:54:04 Too many investors either stuck holding pot stocks too high, or still bleeding with BTC stocks that they may be missing out on other opportunities in tech and businesses outside pot, btc and resources.  with that said, maybe bottomfish resources?
964 2018-12-18 20:53:52 Luckily, flamethrowers are legal for recreational use in most US states, so even if they restrict bump stocks, mass murderers will still have options
965 2018-12-18 20:53:49 How many people were there total? Vegas was a tragedy, theres absolutely no doubt about that. But that doesn't mean that a bump stock made it worse than it would have been. Im an avid shooter, ive used bump stocks. They're not accurate and the rifle usually ends up failing.
966 2018-12-18 20:53:22 Stocks don't change semi automatic weapons to  full auto.
967 2018-12-18 20:53:18 Following this afternoon's retest of yesterday's liftoff points we have very positive divergent bottoms in place on inds and across the board in stocks that could be the launch point for further gains tomorrow & into the end of the week, however the Fed action could be v volatile
968 2018-12-18 20:53:10 The argument that the Trump administration isn’t banning bump stocks or further regulating firearms because it’s “unenforceable” is a joke.
969 2018-12-18 20:53:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Plunging oil prices pull energy stocks lower, erasing gains
970 2018-12-18 20:52:55 So for those that follow based on Rocket League here's some life advice for you.. Learn to trade stocks, become an entrepreneur, learn to fail while your young because when you approach your thirties, i'm sure in your thirties, you'll want to experience winning without a day job.
971 2018-12-18 20:52:45 Watching the market drop- is that because Senators and House of Representatives are selling off their insider trading purchased stocks - ie:  Military Government Contractor, Military equipment manufacturer, Big Pharma, Stock before they get arrested for committing a crime???
972 2018-12-18 20:52:40 It’s still very early, but this is looking like a successful test of the 2018 lows and potentially the start of a “rip your face off” rally...

Stay tuned!! #stocks #StockMarket
973 2018-12-18 20:52:40 Wow! Banning bump stocks, The Trump Foundation dissolves...is “The Donald” losing it...I mean, more than usual?
974 2018-12-18 20:52:37 Bump stocks, sadly, are only one method of many, of making these guns like a machine gun.
975 2018-12-18 20:52:31 How can we have a space army without laser bump stocks?
976 2018-12-18 20:52:22 RIP Bumb Stocks, though as a liberal post-modern neo-marxist armchair antifa cuck, I would have preferred we get rid of guns by breaking into peoples homes, stealing them, and replacing them with pro gay globalist agenda SJW literature.
977 2018-12-18 20:52:05 Does anyone know when the cutoff for the $mpx $ian merger is to get the spinoff shares of $mpx international?
#Cannabis #stocks
978 2018-12-18 20:51:45 So what you are saying is that people who own bump stocks kill people?
979 2018-12-18 20:51:27 Bet all the dems are suddenly gonna start supporting bump stocks since Trump wants them gone now not my problem either way
980 2018-12-18 20:51:23 POLL: Do you agree with the Trump administration's move to officially ban bump stocks?
981 2018-12-18 20:51:14 Alright lets answer this once for all.

What is the fed going to do with interest rates tomorrow?

#stocks #investing #fomc #interestrates
982 2018-12-18 20:51:11 biotech is truly a mess. whether the market sells off or bounces, these stocks continue to tank. there does not appear to be an end in sight. look at stocks like lptx, tril, pirs, or vktx. hell, look at celg. just a disaster
983 2018-12-18 20:50:57 .@brookebcnn:@VanJones68:@cnn:@nicolledwallace:Brooke, Taylor Winston just told U that many mass shootings didn't involve bump stocks. Hope U'd inform viewers accordingly. The ACA DT has been savaging has mental illness provision. Tell Taylor! DT loves optics&hates real solutions
984 2018-12-18 20:50:55 Stocks will rally how much tomorrow after the FED hike:
985 2018-12-18 20:50:50 In a sense yes. People that want to follow the law will not but the gun part called bump stocks. 
But they will still have their guns. 
This is just a part that makes the gun respond differently to one trigger pull. 
You do know this does not make an ad turn into an assult rifle
986 2018-12-18 20:50:47 As we now 'know', there IS a 'deep-state' in D.C.- 4 Trillion dollars 'vanished' from stocks?  Haven't the excuses' for the Fed's action been exhausted...  If an engine is not running correctly- this crowd suggests- start, by washing the car?  what?
987 2018-12-18 20:50:34 Dont you think bump stocks do more harm than good? We have no need of them they arent used for hunting/protection, just for fun. They seem like they do more harm than good(Vegas) and if we go to war with our own government, i dont think having a bump stock will make a difference.
988 2018-12-18 20:49:58 If owners paint them orange, call them "Trump Stocks" and pay the $200 tax, can they keep them? #NFA #BumpStocks #TrumpStocks #IdeasAreFree
989 2018-12-18 20:49:57 “Hand them over”

HA! Bump stocks are a product of Redneck Engineering. Anybody that WANTS to shoot one like that (which is frankly dumb) will build one with plywood and wood screws. You don’t need to buy one if you want one.
990 2018-12-18 20:49:53 Wild Violets?  I'll check stocks in the daylight.  I know I only have one Sarah left but I can dye more.
991 2018-12-18 20:49:29 Tim seems like the type of guy who would hoard bump stocks
992 2018-12-18 20:49:02 I just like blaming things on Tom Brady. Deflategate, Spygate, global warming, stocks being down. If it's bad, it's clearly Tom Brady's fault.
993 2018-12-18 20:48:54 Who in Grenadatwitter can help me buy shares in grenlec #grenada #stocks #bonds
994 2018-12-18 20:48:49 the problem is they know very well they cannot ban bump stocks and are counting on the courts overruling them.
995 2018-12-18 20:48:48 Buying put spreads been better considering the steep skew structures in indiv. stocks
996 2018-12-18 20:48:48 There’s no way you’ll convince me that all these MAGA people wouldn’t have flipped shit if Obama had banned bump stocks.
997 2018-12-18 20:48:37 Features that were a Twitter priority: tagging stocks like $HAL, changing the star to a heart, preventing cusses @ celebs

Features that weren't: preventing endless abuse of women, queer folks, and PoC
998 2018-12-18 20:48:33 Anybody else think that THIS, Trump banning bump-stocks and Fat Sarah denying Trump wants Congress to come across with wall money ARE JUST DESPERATE ATTEMPTS TO BUOY HIS RATINGS AND AVOID THE CONSEQUENCES OF DOZENS OF INVESTIGATIONS ?
999 2018-12-18 20:48:21 Pls tell ur friend, President Trump that his base is discouraged. Just today, He caved on the wall, give $10  billion to Mexico/Central America  and banned/confiscate bump stocks. Hope he enjoys being a 1 term President
1000 2018-12-18 20:47:43 At roundtable on school safety this afternoon, the administration directly champions its ban on bump stocks as a win for school safety
1001 2018-12-18 20:47:40 #ARMRreport We book 100%+ profit on #stockmarket Puts at low and #stocks rally back to rcmVWAP. But $IWM continues to lag
1002 2018-12-18 20:47:06 And this is one of the few stocks I am still holding. As you say, unless a recession kills their sales they are now amazingly cheap.
1003 2018-12-18 20:46:56 Except cars and bump stocks are two totally different things.
1004 2018-12-18 20:46:34 Hey @ScottishPower why is it I cannot find anyone who stocks your pre pay card anywhere in east London/Essex borders? I’ve been holding for your customer services for hours. I just want some advice as to who stocks your cards
1005 2018-12-18 20:46:33 Liz, I’m a Semi-Gun expert. Bump stocks basically DO turn a Semi-Auto into an Auto with one trigger pull. They are unsafe and useless. You can even achieve this effect with a belt loop and your thumb as well so I guess we can ban that next. Just facts.
1006 2018-12-18 20:46:18 The Las Vegas shooter fired 90 rounds every 10 seconds using bump stocks, ultimately killing 59, and wounding hundreds.
1007 2018-12-18 20:45:54 The President just said he's going to confiscate bump stocks. Will gun owners now take up arms against him?  Probably not, so that argument is moot.
1008 2018-12-18 20:45:53 * Jesse plans on murdering people in the future if bump stocks are made illegal - got it.

cc: @FBI
1009 2018-12-18 20:45:45 @WalshFreedom @JesseKellyDC good luck beating the federal government with your bump stocks you clowns!!
1010 2018-12-18 20:45:43 Trump taking away bump stocks (the tool used in the Las Vegas massacre to enable rapid bursts and fire more) is astounding. And probably the ONE good thing he’s done so far as president. Everyone should praise him for this, I’m serious. He lives off what people think of him.
1011 2018-12-18 20:45:42 Good afternoon Frank! How are you buddy? I see the stocks are pretty awful lately..
1012 2018-12-18 20:45:04 Bump stocks are contraband,

Government shutdown avoided, stuff like that
1013 2018-12-18 20:44:51 To the extent that's true: good!

I also did some research that explained the NRA was trying to have bump stocks regulated by the ATF, when in fact it has already been ruled that the ATF lacks Congressional authority to regulate such devices. Thus, there would be no restriction.
1014 2018-12-18 20:44:22 What about Hump Stocks?
1015 2018-12-18 20:43:48 Y’all might wanna invest in local gym stocks first of the years coming 
1016 2018-12-18 20:43:26 As the market continues to fall, which of the following are you doing? #stocks #crypto
1017 2018-12-18 20:43:23 Seeing stocks rebound in the final hour is a nice change of character. Looks like we'll be close to flat today.
1018 2018-12-18 20:43:16 1v1, 3 stocks, no items, final destination. all controllers allowed u can't choose meta knight
1019 2018-12-18 20:43:06 The bump stocks ban is wonderful news for everyone except College Gun Girl, who now will have to develop a personality.
1020 2018-12-18 20:43:04 Rollercoaster day: DC Council passed important gun safety legislation. Trump admin banned bump stocks, but recommended arming teachers. Trump admin repealed Obama guidance school discipline guidance that protects students of color, stupidly blaming it for Parkland. #whiplash
1021 2018-12-18 20:42:47 @realDonaldTrump we see you stirring up a pot of deflection. The bump stocks we're perfect for a starter. Now for big flavor offer up the stolen children & return them to their families. Now that would be a great pot of deflection. Come on, you can do it donnie.
1022 2018-12-18 20:42:47 Federal reserves is busted!! Going to knock it out for its corruption against people. 

Im not worried with stock markets. Owned stocks 20yrs. Check back March!
1023 2018-12-18 20:42:41 Correct. I worry that some will use this to go after other modifications. From what was reported, the shooter in Vegas used bump stocks. But there is so much more we don’t know about the shooter and his motive.
1024 2018-12-18 20:42:37 Trump just banned bump stocks Maybe now he should ban his fucked up gutless son from pushing for silencers to be legalized
1025 2018-12-18 20:42:16 Thats not "limiting 2A" its disallowing an aftermarket product.. like Barrel clips. Bump stocks are crap anyway. Good luck with that soft brain of yours
1026 2018-12-18 20:42:14 Well, since ALL @realDonaldTrump supporters are rule of LAW followers, they are all going to surrender their stocks to the government, right? 

Wait, what administration was the one to start taking items from you?

Well that can't be right, Hillary isn't president.


1027 2018-12-18 20:41:35 Are the values of stocks today $1T higher?
1028 2018-12-18 20:41:32 @SaraEisen @WilfredFrost So, U.S. bond yields down hard, U.S. stocks in a vicious SELLOFF, oil prices down hard, Europe in a sharp slowdown, China slowing down, housing market in a sharp slowdown. Maybe the Fed SHOULD be listening to the President, or just do the right thing.
1029 2018-12-18 20:41:31 Well, Sarah Sanders lies at a press conference and Flynn got his ass chewed by the judge. Oh, and a republican president banned bump stocks, so the NRA is gonna flip out.
1030 2018-12-18 20:41:20 Thanks for talking Trump in banning bump stocks today. Keep talking to him about ban on assults weapons @mschlapp
1031 2018-12-18 20:41:12 The big picture is that so far he's just Jeb! with a better bark on Twitter. (Although I don't know if Jeb would have been dumb enough to ban bump stocks.)
1032 2018-12-18 20:41:02 I'm no fan of bump stocks, but the idea of a taking without compensation under this new rule bugs the hell out of me. But I would have to read the rule, which I have not, to see where @JoshMBlackman is going.
1033 2018-12-18 20:40:49 Interesting week going long on CBD stocks
1034 2018-12-18 20:40:37 The most interesting thing about the bump stocks being banned:

1) Shows how little leverage the NRA now has with the Feds, probably due to their financial situation.

2) Is this a last chance shot for the Administration to gain favor with the American Majority?
1035 2018-12-18 20:40:36 As much as I crap all over what is happening at 1600 penn ave they did all Americans a service by banning bump stocks today.
1036 2018-12-18 20:40:34  Check these #stocks that made record highs: $BPOPN
1037 2018-12-18 20:40:32 They'll probably be worth a pretty penny since they're now illegal. But I imagine savy gun owners will just be 3D printing bump stocks in the future. It looks no different than the numerous 3D printed mods and body kits available for Nerf blasters.
1038 2018-12-18 20:40:02 Bump stocks but for crowlers.
1039 2018-12-18 20:39:55 Will give the admin i kudos today for banning bump stocks, now lets do univ background checks and assault rifle ban and see what happens.  #gunsense
1040 2018-12-18 20:39:32 Yeah, but Chinese GDP isn’t dependent on Chinese stocks...US’ is
1041 2018-12-18 20:39:27 not a lawyer: but I would tend to agree. That said, bump stocks are a silly toy.
1042 2018-12-18 20:39:20 Trump is caving on wall funding, banning bump stocks, and supporting final passage of criminal justice reform all on the same day. 

I support all three of these things, but I suspect many of his most ardent supporters do not.
1043 2018-12-18 20:39:16 Thanks for banning bump stocks today!  TRUMP IS COMING AFTER 2nd AMENDMENT TODAY.  Any comments Trumpers
1044 2018-12-18 20:38:52 @EthanBearman Full auto firearms are not banned and are relatively easy to get, just expensive. And bump stocks do not turn a semi auto into an automatic. It still requires the activation of the trigger for each round fired. It just allows this to happen at a faster rate.
1045 2018-12-18 20:38:44 They prob just read the deal news and bought the stocks
1046 2018-12-18 20:38:38 And there goes what was left of my inheritance. So much for leaving it as stocks til I retired...
1047 2018-12-18 20:38:32 Are bump stocks something you can fab on a printer? Or carve out of hardwood, in a pinch? Do they have moving parts, or are they themselves a moving part?
1048 2018-12-18 20:38:24 Complacency is the key driver for lot of Execs and Engineers alike to join FANG companies. The stocks keep growing and the work is Guardianship of Evolutionary Products
1049 2018-12-18 20:38:23 Responding to stocks moving downward, U.S. Economist Joseph Ziddle said today, 'I think this is a sentiment issue, not a fundamental issue'...
-----------
Who is 'responsible' economic 'sentiment'- Is this not a Fed invoked 'assault' against a strong U.S. economy?
1050 2018-12-18 20:38:18 By the way, botty mouth, don't forget to turn in your bump stocks today.  I'd hate for a bot like you to get fined before having the opportunity of turning into a REAL boy.
1051 2018-12-18 20:38:03 Can’t wait to see the videos the NRA freaks post of MAGA gear getting shot up by AF-15’s with bump stocks tonight.
1052 2018-12-18 20:37:58 I don't remember anyone being mad about the thought of banning bump stocks when it was first brought up. The NRA was in support of banning them, as well as pretty much everyone I have seen interviewed.
1053 2018-12-18 20:37:56 Antifa never called for a ban on bump stocks. Next time vote for us.
1054 2018-12-18 20:37:47 Investing tip: Don't buy stocks after surgery while on pain pills.
1055 2018-12-18 20:37:40 Where does the constitution talk about bump stocks?
1056 2018-12-18 20:37:31 Bump stocks are mentioned in the constitution?
1057 2018-12-18 20:37:21 Wow they really banned bump stocks. What’s next semi automatic rifles
1058 2018-12-18 20:36:37 Did someone replace trump with a clone? One who actually stopped whining about the wall and who actually stood up to the NRA and imposed a ban on bump stocks?
1059 2018-12-18 20:36:26 Problem is many of us are questioning the reliability of Trump and his administration... 

If the ban on bump stocks is true Trump just lost his second term. No, our firearms are not safe as has been said by Q. So that was a big lie for many people and unconstitutional. No trust.
1060 2018-12-18 20:36:24 You're the right person to serve on this task force. Today's WH announcement re bump stocks happened because we elected a #GunSenseMajority. It's a start.
1061 2018-12-18 20:36:15 Trump just outlawed bump stocks, I'm waiting to hear the outrage. (there comin for your guns) (literally, you need to turn in your bump stocks).
1062 2018-12-18 20:35:58 How am I wrong? Ask any person actually trained in armed combat they will say the exact same thing. 

Bump stocks are for cuck baby boomers who can't handle their weapons or their egos
1063 2018-12-18 20:35:31 @realDonaldTrump Sir you just opened a door that could lead this country into civil war. Under no circumstance will we ever EVER allow anyone to dictate our 2nd amendment rights. I hope you understand what you've done. You can't even aim with bump stocks lol. So much for rep us
1064 2018-12-18 20:35:23 Hey, I’m losing money in my little stocks I have. I think this is the moment I became an adult.
1065 2018-12-18 20:35:11 This flew over your head for a change.
Bump stocks are a violation of machine gun bans so should have been banned immediately.
I said "claimed" , a sarcastic reply to a comically inept president. 
Nobody supports bump stocks.
1066 2018-12-18 20:35:04 And now, the NRA Trumpists, who claimed Trump would never ban bump stocks, will say they've always supported the ban.
Put the tweets saying otherwise down the memoryholes.
1067 2018-12-18 20:35:00 Unfortunately there are those of us who have our retirement savings/401K’s tied up in stocks and bonds that when the evil’s bills come due will impact us as well. I cannot afford to lose 1/2 of my money. I will not survive on Social Security.
1068 2018-12-18 20:34:59 The adults who understand economics can’t be happy with this guy running us off a cliff. My wife is 65 & planning to retire in 2 years. I put her 401K in the least risky funds. She made a lot in the last 5-6 years, but I see nothing but trouble. Are stocks overvalued?
1069 2018-12-18 20:34:40 Ah, his mother bumps stocks in hell.
1070 2018-12-18 20:34:32 Why would you try and make that point? Regardless, you’re wrong. Just like you’re wrong about bump stocks and the new law going into effect. My original statement stands: Trump has established more gun regulations than any president since Clinton.
1071 2018-12-18 20:34:19  yeah bump stocks..that’s a biggie..that will stop them criminals. Like all the gun laws on the books now are doing.  homelessness is directly related to taxing. CA & NY have the highest homeless & it’s getting worse because they Tax their people into oblivion. Just go away
1072 2018-12-18 20:34:18 @realDonaldTrump 
You banned bump stocks?
ARE YOU TRYING TO LOSE VOTERS!!? You're lucky the left is stupid! If they were smart they'd know any infringement on the the 2nd Amendment is how to separate you from the your base!
1073 2018-12-18 20:33:56 Keep in mind 50% of Americans don't have any exposure to stocks either directly or through work-sponsored plans like 401-ks. That's why progressives like myself would rather see wages rising than the stock market rising.
1074 2018-12-18 20:33:35 There is a BILL on BANNING BUMP STOCKS sitting in Congress since 10/31/17.

BUT NOW WITH A STROKE OF PEN BY a ACTING AG, they are banned. Hmm.. Somebody splain it to me...
1075 2018-12-18 20:33:28 Bump stocks, 30 round magazines, and silencers have NEVER EVER KILLED ANYONE!
1076 2018-12-18 20:33:23 I'm sorry, but your comment - if intended for me - has left me in the dark.

I was referring to the report that stocks had dropped WITHOUT mentioning that they are STILL considerably higher than when he took office. 

Hope that clarifies.

Umm, why would Twitter edit comments?
1077 2018-12-18 20:33:21 Yeah it’s the stocks, gotcha
1078 2018-12-18 20:33:16 damn Trump banned the bump stocks nationwide
1079 2018-12-18 20:33:11 @POTUS WHAT did you get in exchange for ban on bump stocks?  If nothing, that's not an "artful deal" #Outnumbered
1080 2018-12-18 20:33:06 @NRA no statement on bump stocks?
1081 2018-12-18 20:32:44 The Trump administration banned bump stocks??? bih wha
1082 2018-12-18 20:32:41 That’s how stocks usually work, some good news shoots up and eventually stabilises. Of course it could keep rising depending on our results/DOF appointment/new manager
1083 2018-12-18 20:32:40 Man, there are gonna be so many boating accidents in the coming months thanks to Donald "I'll protect your gun rights" Trump went and banned bump stocks.

If banning one reporter from looking at your Twitter violates the First Amendment, banning one firearm violated the Second.
1084 2018-12-18 20:32:38 The Trump admin officially banned bump stocks! Credit where credit is due... that is a good thing!
1085 2018-12-18 20:32:37 The market outpaces legislation always. Bump stocks were legal until the realization of what they can do. The Federal Tax stamp needed for suppressors and full auto are there for a reason. It’s so the feds can take a hard look at you. The bump stock bypasses that.
1086 2018-12-18 20:32:19 This is sooo bad, Trump banned bump stocks to take attn away from the possible treason committed by Flynn.
1087 2018-12-18 20:32:12 Good job on banning bump stocks, White House squatter. This is a good thing and a first step toward better gun control.
1088 2018-12-18 20:32:08 Translation: PLEASE STOP SELLING YOUR STOCKS
1089 2018-12-18 20:31:56 What about 3D printing bump stocks?
1090 2018-12-18 20:31:43 The ONLY good thing to come out of the #TrumpAdministration  is the banning of bump stocks today. #GunControl
1091 2018-12-18 20:31:37 BUMP STOCKS OFFICIALLY BANNED
1092 2018-12-18 20:31:32 Thank you President Trump for banning “Bump Stocks!”
1093 2018-12-18 20:31:21 Someone remind trump, low oil prices hurt energy stocks. Energy stock pressure hurts Energy HY bonds. HY bond pressure hurts equities... #facepalm
1094 2018-12-18 20:31:17 They stated recently they want to approach listings the same way stock exchanges do. You can buy hundreds of stocks on Etrade, Fidelity, etc. Imagine if they only listed the top 3 stocks from each sector, clearly that wouldn't be smart long term.
1095 2018-12-18 20:31:06 Trump BANS BUMP STOCKS EFFECTIVE THIS FRIDAY

Flynn
Gen. Flynn
1096 2018-12-18 20:31:01 Hi mark. I try to figure which ones have been unduly punished and add to them. What stocks do you own?
1097 2018-12-18 20:30:58 It’s sad that these experts believe he could have killed more people if he would have taken his time and idiots like you say there’s a great reason to keep bump stocks.
1098 2018-12-18 20:30:38 Yep. Stocks on sale.
1099 2018-12-18 20:30:04 @BoZiger earth to boris.... Your stocks at 8 cents... How longs it been since the license... No greenhouse building yet... No clones... You are simply unreal... Given up on even dangling the carrot... What a let down
1100 2018-12-18 20:29:58 I don't care why he did it. I don't care who did it. All I know is that BUMP STOCKS have been BANNED. THIS ISSUE SHOULD NO LONGER BE A POLITICAL ISSUE. It should be about saving lives. So today I celebrate this common sense decision.
1101 2018-12-18 20:29:50 How will I feed my family this winter without bump stocks?
1102 2018-12-18 20:29:46 When will Stocks make edibles, is the real question.
1103 2018-12-18 20:29:40 Soooo gun owners have 90 days to voluntarily turn in their bump stocks to their nearest ATF office OR nothing will happen to them. Sound policy change by the Trump administration yet again.
1104 2018-12-18 20:29:26 $CSCO is acquiring a #semiconductor company for 660M The company is Luxtera #stocks #StockMarket #stockstowatch #markets #investments #investing #WallStreet #Finance #economics #economy
1105 2018-12-18 20:29:24 And you know Liesman will open the questioning tmw with something like, "Stocks are having the worst Dec since the Great Depression, does that factor into your thinking?"
1106 2018-12-18 20:29:23 Props when/where it’s due: banning Bump stocks is a good thing! Nowhere near enough, but it’s a good thing this administration has done.
1107 2018-12-18 20:29:21 Hmmmm, I thought only Democrats wanted to ban bump stocks and take guns away. Looks like the Republicans do too. Come on conservatives come at me.
1108 2018-12-18 20:29:19 @realDonaldTrump NRA and gun owners cry “the sky is falling” about Obama but Trump admin confiscating bump stocks.
1109 2018-12-18 20:29:00 not the same as banning stocks
1110 2018-12-18 20:28:49 2019 is going to be a big year for investors / traders. Are you ready and well-prepared ? #Stocks #Forex #Commodities
1111 2018-12-18 20:28:29 Wow! Bump stocks are finally banned. If you have one you have 90 days to destroy it or turn it in. It's about time!
1112 2018-12-18 20:28:29 You are such a sleeze! Now, you want to ban bump stocks! You could have done this over a year & a half ago BUT now that your #'s are dropping you pull this rabbit out of your hat! Believe me, this isn't going to get you any brownie points with anybody! cc: @realdonaldtrump
1113 2018-12-18 20:28:25 But $BABA has a reasonable valuation based on the numbers as presented. I guess one can sometimes find bubble stocks with no earnings but made-up revenue and contracts though, so perhaps (unlike the new $TSLA factory site!) my theory doesn't hold water.
1114 2018-12-18 20:28:09 BREAKING NEWS: @realDonaldTrump speaking on school safety right now, telling Parkland shooting survivors about his official move to ban bump stocks. @POTUS: "We are profoundly grateful to the Parkland families"
1115 2018-12-18 20:28:04 Then what's the point of bump stocks then?  So should the creator of bump stocks be sued for fraud if they are completely useless and pointless?
1116 2018-12-18 20:28:00 Trump is fkn sick in the head!  He’s talking (passively) Bump stocks and the Parkland Shooting, saying

He’s gotten to know the incredible parents well!  I just blew a gasket!  

@POTUS NO, you did’t acknowledge the Parkland Shooting, ASSHOLE!  I Think my tv is broken!
1117 2018-12-18 20:27:55 grande consultation, juste le temps de refaire des stocks de lacrymo et de grenades pour mener tambour battant "les réformes"  #macron
1118 2018-12-18 20:27:51 @realDonaldTrump  By banning "bump stocks” the Trump administration is falling into the Global Socialist trap.
1119 2018-12-18 20:27:34 #ard: Bump Stocks werden in den USA verboten.
1120 2018-12-18 20:27:32 props to Trump admin for banning bump stocks
Kudos
1121 2018-12-18 20:27:28 Totally thought bump stocks were a type of easy-and-quick-to-use means of getting rich! Still don't understand how 1 stock differs from the next when it comes to the overall purpose of a gun. Does a bump stock provide some kind of pain-alleviating high upon it's use?!
1122 2018-12-18 20:27:14 You'll complain no matter what his administration does. If he didn't move to ban bump stocks, you would complain about that.
1123 2018-12-18 20:27:13 Trump Admin Bans Bump Stocks.
1124 2018-12-18 20:27:04 as you described that was a loophole correct now it is gonna be fixed and bump stocks going to become illegal as in reality they make rifles fully automatic without regards any sort of definitions
1125 2018-12-18 20:26:53 its fun! i trade this $tvix and mostly etfs when market is volatile. In bull markets they suck to trade but in this. much cleaner moves in them then stocks and same range
1126 2018-12-18 20:26:01 Good to hear about those stocks! Also NOTHING BUT LOVE!!!
1127 2018-12-18 20:25:53 this fall, paper trading stocks from the long side is more fruitful than using real capital... don't forget that cash is a decision too...
1128 2018-12-18 20:25:47 but but but....the stocks go up sometimes! and dont let that distract you from HER EMAILS!!!1!
1129 2018-12-18 20:25:11 @cj_disabledVet @politicususa well he HAS!  he is also desperate for a media distraction so he FINALLY banned bump stocks.

1131 2018-12-18 20:24:37 Banning bump stocks? Funding Planned Parenthood? "Criminal Justice Reform" lol

No wall, shitty spending bill, Kavanaugh siding w/ shitlibs.

And thats w/ Republicunts controlling congress.

Might as well have elected Rubio/Jeb

1133 2018-12-18 20:24:27 It's sort of bothers me when the Second Amendment it actually says the right of the people to bear arms shall not be infringed and yet to put bump stocks as illegal an automatic Firearms to what they call Legal citizens after what the ATF has done like I said before
1134 2018-12-18 20:24:16 Trump has banned bump stocks and it applies to existing devices that people already own. Those people will have 90-days to either turn the devices in or otherwise destroy them. I'm really glad that Trump did this. Could you imagine what would have happened if Obama banned them?
1135 2018-12-18 20:23:55 @potus  Banning bump stocks?   That’s all you got?   What about banning all firearms In schools, or are you still supporting The NRA/Russia?
1136 2018-12-18 20:23:46 Smoke and mirrors folks. Donald having a press conference about his administration advising banning bump stocks means zero.
What is important, the looming shutdown, Cohen, Flynn, and the Trump Foundation being dissolved and they have had their checkbook taken away.
Oh and Treason
1137 2018-12-18 20:23:39 To parrot the abortion argument: people will now be forced to get their bump stocks in back alleys.
1138 2018-12-18 20:23:08 @BrookeBCNN @MSNBC @CNN @CBSNews @abcnews Donald Trump ordered the ATF to ban bump stocks...so does that include binary triggers, trigger cranks, and any other auxiliary and external modifications? Ask the right questions.
1139 2018-12-18 20:23:07 Dipshit is on tv lying out his ass as he pretends he knows what he is saying & reading as pertaining to the banning of bump stocks. He sounded like a poor 4th grader called on to read out loud in current events class.
1140 2018-12-18 20:22:57 It may look like Trumpty is actually doing his job by banning bump stocks, but he knows his @NRA buddies will be challenging that EO before the ink is dry. #GunSenseNow
1141 2018-12-18 20:22:53 We can thank over valued stocks for this correction & a slow down in China’s economy
1142 2018-12-18 20:22:36 Tis the season to ban bump stocks...I guess because he now needs to have some significant accomplishments to "disprove" what a....never mind.  I guess we should be grateful regardless of motive?
1143 2018-12-18 20:22:34 Historically  business are gearing up for year-end closing of the accounting period...write offs, asset purchases and losses are of the norm. I'll be stocking up on my stocks this month.
1144 2018-12-18 20:22:28 There 's little evidence that a recession is near, however, many are pointing to that. The stock market is the best LEI.. The S&P has held up, but there are many individual stocks that are in a bear market. The market is smarter than the public; we should always respect it.
1145 2018-12-18 20:22:25 But I don't even remember any of the TRIPLE-digit PE Internet bubble-stocks being financial frauds... I mean, the whole point of doing a financial fraud is to make the valuation seem reasonable!
1146 2018-12-18 20:22:25 bah oue tu le sauras pour la prochaine jpense qu’ils vont être ruptures de stocks de cartes tellement les gens vont en acheter
1147 2018-12-18 20:22:19 @brookskcbsradio no guarantees but looking just at Declining stocks #, looks like ‘head fake ‘ was to break lows .. its like football coaches always yelled, “ watch jersey not helmet “
1148 2018-12-18 20:22:04 It's not over yet. #Stocks will carry on losing the excessive gains accumulated over the bubble of the past couple of years, and then some more. Total disconnect between stocks & economy couldn't last; fundamentals matter. See previous tweets in this thread.
1149 2018-12-18 20:21:59 *sees article claiming Trump admin wants to ban bump stocks*

*Comment section is full of "damn Dems won't listen and just want our guns"*

..wtf
1150 2018-12-18 20:21:50 I suppose 45 will want great praise for his token effort of banning bump stocks to reduce school shootings. Not happening. Too little, too late for so many.
1151 2018-12-18 20:21:49 So now that the NRA is under investigation, Trump and his cabinet decide to ban bump stocks?
1152 2018-12-18 20:21:42 How do the trumpets feel about having 90 days to turn in their bump stocks?
1153 2018-12-18 20:21:38 Joe, you own stocks?
1154 2018-12-18 20:21:34 When the going gets tough, save the children & ban bump stocks. Better late than never I suppose
1155 2018-12-18 20:21:30 TRUMP is desperate for a distraction so, after the entire country demanding action on Guns he is finally outlawing bump stocks @AliVelshi
1156 2018-12-18 20:21:27 is it better for your little biotech  stocks to drip drip drip everyday down 30-50 cents and go to zero or just crash to ZERO  on the open one day and get it over with ?.=.out of site out of mind. /  torture /.. I'm still torn
1157 2018-12-18 20:21:26 stocks ?
1158 2018-12-18 20:21:25 @GuyAdami
Stocks begin to fall when traders realize that Guy's Birthday is almost over.
1159 2018-12-18 20:21:22 It does. It clearly violates Heller at the SCOTUS level and Maloney at the Federal level. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, at the very least and probably 18 U.S. Code § 983.

That said, nobody cares as bump stocks were a gimmick that have the Left a enemy to attack.
1160 2018-12-18 20:21:08 #POTUS 
Trump desparate for some good press.

Banning bump stocks.
1161 2018-12-18 20:20:58 @EschmanRick - just heard President Trump has a bill banning bump stocks, u need to turn them in or destroy them, no buy back. I’ll be anxious to see how many get turned in !!!! 
1162 2018-12-18 20:20:54 Still don’t know what to do with these bank stocks.
1163 2018-12-18 20:20:42 One thing he just did just now was to make bump stocks illegal. That's a good thing. As you can see, he can and should be doing good stuff like this. Forget the wall. We have a much bigger problem in America. Drug addicts, homelessness, jail 4 minor crimes and income disparity.
1164 2018-12-18 20:19:54 I’m not a fan of “bans” in general and think bump stocks are quite useless. The idea of having to turn something in the govt is simply not right.
1165 2018-12-18 20:19:44 bump stocks are illegal due to the fact they make rifles fully automatic which is prohibited by law, and second what is the point for a fully automatic rifle?
1166 2018-12-18 20:19:43 If they wish, certain people can complain all they want in the privacy of their own heads. It used to be ok to assault and throw things at people who were clamped in the public stocks - then they introduced an Act to ban it. So that intolerance was stopped. Go figure
1167 2018-12-18 20:19:41 @realDonaldTrump Has just moved to ban bump stocks. What's the @nra position on this?
1168 2018-12-18 20:19:10 Bump stocks 

Background checks 

Gun violence research 

ATF restrictions 

Funding intervention                    programs 

Extreme risk protection 

Disarm domestic abusers 

Gun trafficking 

Safe storage laws 

Thank u, next
1169 2018-12-18 20:19:05 300-plus point rally on the DJIA vanishes as stocks trade lower on the day.
1170 2018-12-18 20:18:57 Big mistake. You're about to make 1 million Americans criminals when they had no intent. ( See James Comey for definition) Bump Stocks do not meet the definition of a machine gun.  #NRA
1171 2018-12-18 20:18:31 Then the only ones that will have bump stocks will be the criminals... #LearningNothing
1172 2018-12-18 20:18:09 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, the bear market in stocks is partly and directly the results in the bear market in crude oil prices.
1173 2018-12-18 20:18:08 A good day for stocks, and a GREAT day for $TLSA 

Many more days like this to come!

There may be a CHRISTmas rally, but dowward spiral only just beginning in time & scope. It's not different this time!

Vengeance is mine, sayeth the market. God bless margin clerks.

1174 2018-12-18 20:18:06 Energy sector stocks take a broad beating as crude oil prices tumble
1175 2018-12-18 20:17:50 I think bump stocks are foolish and dangerous at best, and I would not go to a range that allowed them (the whole concept involves an intentional reduction of control of the weapon), but if someone wants to yeehaw themselves to an early grave, then so be it.
1176 2018-12-18 20:17:43 Bump stocks banned today?  That's a step.
1177 2018-12-18 20:17:38 Beloved value (defensive) stocks are getting killed. See $HSY for another example.
1178 2018-12-18 20:17:23 So, you've essentially done nothing? You're not going to go door to door so these stocks will still be out there ...  Great Job!
1179 2018-12-18 20:17:21 About 84% of stocks are now below their 200 day SMA. highest level since January 2016 when it went over 90%
1180 2018-12-18 20:17:16 Mdr ça existe encore les stocks de Galaxy S5 ?
1181 2018-12-18 20:17:11 A rubber band can do the same thing as those stocks! Ban rubber bands!! 
1182 2018-12-18 20:16:40 Stocks Lol. Business in football, we are still shit though in football terms
1183 2018-12-18 20:16:36 $DPW  market is crap..well alot of my bluesheet are red compare my over the counter stocks... Which are green. Remind me of Brexit in 2016
1184 2018-12-18 20:16:26 Bump stocks are meant for shooting people? Lol you must be joking right?
1185 2018-12-18 20:16:22 Even worse, now that @realDonaldTrump has signed the executive order banning bump stocks, she’ll be forced to #Resist eminent domain by firing one bullet at a time.
That’s what you get when you go all the way for the @NRA.
1186 2018-12-18 20:16:16 Since bump stocks weren't required to be registered by the owner nor prohibited from private sale, It would be difficult to prove for sure who still may have one.
1187 2018-12-18 20:15:43 Bump stocks are literally Hitler.
1188 2018-12-18 20:15:34 can some shops have on-hand stocks for w1 past albums so I can still buy it next year? Huhu
1189 2018-12-18 20:15:29 I took a class in high school called Financial Planning. It was required, and it taught students how to budget for a household based on income, balancing a check book, navigating stocks, planning for retirement, how do to taxes, etc. Best class ever. Period.
1190 2018-12-18 20:15:24 I DONT KNOW HOW STOCKS WORK.
1191 2018-12-18 20:15:10 Never said what side i’m on, just said banning bump stocks is a good change.
1192 2018-12-18 20:14:25 Bump stocks- unacceptable. Rapists- acceptable.
1193 2018-12-18 20:14:16 #INFA in my opinion probably of one the safest stocks to invest in on aim. A great year so far, 2019 will be ever better...
1194 2018-12-18 20:13:59 As I mentioned in the thread. You just need special permitting, which requires special deeper background checks and other bits. Bump stocks make a device effectively full auto.
1195 2018-12-18 20:13:37 You better believe I’m gonna snitch on people who own bump stocks after these 90 days.
1196 2018-12-18 20:13:29 @TheNotoriousMMA stocks are low in Citywest
1197 2018-12-18 20:13:26 Incorrect, but Bump stocks became a focal point of the national gun control debate after they were used in October 2017 when a man opened fired from his Las Vegas hotel suite into a crowd at a country music concert below, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more.
1198 2018-12-18 20:12:42 If you need a turn in location just message me. I’ll turn in your bump stocks and even you guns!
1199 2018-12-18 20:12:33 There is cdx a benefit to owning bump stocks. If you allow just one right to be taken you will allow all rights. Just  one at a time.
1200 2018-12-18 20:12:31 Amazing to see 2 years of gains in many stocks wiped out in the space of a few weeks. $SPY
1201 2018-12-18 20:12:10 Seriously need to replenish my candy stash. Emergency stocks needed in house, car and office.
1202 2018-12-18 20:12:09 Analyst: This is an "international stock" fund, so it has stocks from every country?

Manager: Just Non-US.

Analyst: But the US is part of the interna... nevermind. Okay, this fund says "Total Market," so THIS one is every country, right?

Manager: No, just US.

Analyst: I quit.
1203 2018-12-18 20:12:08 Personally I’m not a fan of bump stocks but see no reason why someone can’t have one or a full auto either. These are all infringements on private property and FREEDOM!
1204 2018-12-18 20:11:43 A gun rights' group will sue the Trump administration for banning bump stocks, saying they're not included in the "machine gun" ban.
1205 2018-12-18 20:11:40 Great that trump banned bump stocks. 
Now trump needs to be banned from trying to bump stocks & fed rates.
1206 2018-12-18 20:11:37 Does every ex fed chairmanchairwoman talk of gloom &
Doom to sell #books   I think so #stocks
1207 2018-12-18 20:11:28 Our president did something previous ones could not. Kudos, Mr. President from a lifetime NRA member. 
The Trump administration on Tuesday banned bump stocks, the rapid-fire attachment used to carry out the Las Vegas shooting.

@Everytown @MomsDemand @NRA @realDonaldTrump
1208 2018-12-18 20:11:17 They aren't afraid of bump stocks being used on innocent people they're afraid that if we ever revolted we'd use the bump stocks on them. Since when did the government ever give a damn about innocent Americans?
1209 2018-12-18 20:11:15 The majority of Americans don't have stocks, but even the ones who don't know how the market Works and there defientally not meaningless, maybe you can ask China for another loan?
1210 2018-12-18 20:11:02 America is doing great.  The rest of the world kinda sucks - maybe because Trump isn't allowing them to screw us on trade any more.  That's one reason stocks are weak.
1211 2018-12-18 20:11:02 J'ai pas compris. Enfin j'ai compris que c'était du second degré mais j'ai pas compris ce que tu voulais dire. Je sais bien qu'on ne jette pas nos déchets nucléaire dans la nature (enfin je pense), on les stocks (je pense notamment au projet de Bure qui est d'enterrer ceci)

1213 2018-12-18 20:10:55 Bump stocks have been banned. I wasn’t expecting that.
1214 2018-12-18 20:10:44 Wow, Trump backing down on the border wall, banning bump stocks, and dissolving the Trump Foundation under judicial review all in the same day.  It appears that he is desperate and caving in. Yesssssssssss!
1215 2018-12-18 20:10:43 Stocks not doing all that great either.
1216 2018-12-18 20:10:40 @POTUS, this is not a good move. I don't care about bump stocks but banning them is a violation of the 2nd Amendment. Giving the ATF even more power and authority they don't have is going to lead to more gun control in the future. Thank you @GunOwners for fighting back! #2AA
1217 2018-12-18 20:10:31 you`re stocks are worth about 277 or so is it worth selling NOW , that's how I LOOK AT IT
1218 2018-12-18 20:10:29 A gun rights' group will sue the Trump administration for banning bump stocks, saying they're not included in the "machine gun" ban.
1219 2018-12-18 20:10:28 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks IS violating the 2nd Amendment.  Just because people alter them it doesn't give place to ban them!
1220 2018-12-18 20:09:31 The way @Citi deal with clients might be a great explanation why stocks are down 27% or $20 past year... took me 15 minutes to get a real person on the phone to don’t solve a problem @Citi created and affects me. I will be switching for some different bank shortly!
1221 2018-12-18 20:09:30 Great question. It was actually during the great recession of 2008. I had some extra cash and wanted to invest. Gold was gaining attention, so I got into gold and silver investing first. Then I moved to stocks. Then I traded futures, options, forex and crypto.
1222 2018-12-18 20:09:29 Big mistake by DOJ in declaring Bump Stocks machine guns. They do not meet the definition. On top of that, the purchase price will not be reimbursed by the ATF EVEN THOUGH they are requiring that they be dstroyed.  Trumps first big mistake #NRA
1223 2018-12-18 20:09:29 So it’s more if you give an inch, they will take a mile. Not that you think bump stocks are needed. (That’s how I feel) 

side note, wasn’t a bump stock used in Vegas or no?

Go bank to Wharton.
1226 2018-12-18 20:07:55 TRUMP signed a bill to ban bump stocks, big deal! Those things are as worthless as tits on a bore hog. 

If that turned u against him, well you probably was never really with him. LOL.
1227 2018-12-18 20:07:39 VIX just hit new Dec high of 26.14. Had been holding below December high of 25.94 hit 2x to the decimal place. On Dec 10th retest, there was a large VXX put seller who came in & marked the bottom (no sign of that seller today). VIX breakout >28/29 would mark new test for stocks.
1228 2018-12-18 20:07:27 My proposal: A bill that 1) bans bump stocks and 2) supersedes all local laws, offering concealed carry to anyone legally qualified to own a gun, willing to take the training?
1229 2018-12-18 20:07:24 So if it doesn’t really matter then what the problem with banning bump stocks? It makes it more difficult for a person who doesn’t know how to manually make a bump stock to kill more people. That’s the point of the ruling. Do you want it to be easily for another Las Vegas?

1232 2018-12-18 20:06:52 Trump: "Stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the Tax Cut Bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size." May we help? We got your tax bill from it's inception.
1233 2018-12-18 20:06:45 There's a big difference between banning/regulating bump stocks (which the NRA supports, and were authorized to be sold under the Obama admin.) and outlawing semi-automatic rifles. Don't try to equate the two to bolster your flawed, unconstitutional argument.
1234 2018-12-18 20:06:44 So I guess that means the five guys who own all the stocks should do what?  Oh yeah, try to sell to the greater fool, yeah.
1235 2018-12-18 20:06:40 Apparently the pro-gun administration just passed a “regulation” - not to be confused with a law by legislators - which will make bump stocks illegal, and their possessors criminals.

Do I have that right?
1236 2018-12-18 20:06:29 I will give you credit for getting rid of Bump stocks. Then in such a Trump way you wipe out a Obama policy that ensured that all kids were disciplined equally, regardless of color. You are such an open racist have just lower our standards “That all people are created equal”

1242 2018-12-18 20:05:18 Are they offering to repay for those bump stocks?  People paid a lot of money for those. They are entitled to be repaid for them.
1243 2018-12-18 20:05:17 Funny, since the NRA believes bump stocks should be banned then I guess it's just a matter of time until the agree carrying to protect your children isn't a justified intention.
1244 2018-12-18 20:04:47 also he did get a three back in that same draft. So a net loss of a 3 and a 5 to get a QB who is above average in almost every category while leading a division champion in year 2. The Jets and Bills gave up far more for Darnold and Josh Allen and are somehow not laughing stocks.
1245 2018-12-18 20:04:37 stocks that haven't tested their Feb lows so far may get rude awakening soon... $AMZN at top of that list
1246 2018-12-18 20:04:16 Would this be a best case year for Active to prove its worth?  If they were up in the summer, got bearish on the breakdown, they could sell and go lighter stocks  Passive can't, passive has to be in here even on the lows.

1256 2018-12-18 20:02:57 its not going to happen. they want to call bump stocks a machine gun, but its not a gun, therefore its going to get struck down.
1257 2018-12-18 20:02:40 Thanks, guys for having me on. Hopefully, I wasn't too bearish but the double-digit returns for stocks for the much of the past ten years are over!
1258 2018-12-18 20:02:36 Why would his base care about bump stocks?  They are inefficient and ineffective in almost all cases.
1259 2018-12-18 20:02:29 Saying Trump’s unilateral bump stock ban is fine because bump stocks are accessories is equal to saying all of California’s bans on pistol grips, vertical grips, and mags over 10 rounds are fine because they’re accessories, too! #DontBeAFudd!
1260 2018-12-18 20:02:21 Look, nobody buys stocks, generally speaking, knowing they're going to lose money. Which is exactly what happened in 2018 due to the negativity of our politics.
1261 2018-12-18 20:02:20 @realDonaldTrump demonstrated that he has no spine re: bumpstocks. Congress decided what constitutes a machine gun and they codified specific language accordingly. Bump stocks don’t meet the definition. Period. Unless you don’t mind violating the Separation of Powers, a la DJT.
1262 2018-12-18 20:02:16 That’s not at all how bump stocks work, Senator. Watch SCOTUS declare the move unconstitutional.

1276 2018-12-18 20:00:39 They did pass the law on Bump Stocks and we have 90 days to either turn them over to the ATF or destroy them  - supposed to be a video on ATF site as to how to do that....

1306 2018-12-18 19:54:31 I often give Trump well deserved criticism, but when he does something right, I applaud. His administration just banned Bump Stocks. Kudos Trump. The other Trump positive, stopping aid to Pakistan. Give credit when due.
1307 2018-12-18 19:54:22 They’re crap.
I’d work a deal on this .
Ban bump stocks for a modification to the SBR rules ( get rid of brace grips)
1308 2018-12-18 19:54:19 Trump admin rolled out new fed reg banning bump fire stocks. 90 days to turn in or destroy.
1309 2018-12-18 19:54:12 This is bad. The Trump administration will make bump stocks illegal. This is a bad move by Trump and the administration.
1310 2018-12-18 19:54:00 To ban bump stocks. Isn’t that what started this shit storm?

1315 2018-12-18 19:53:09 Stan has given many ex about algos distorting price signals. mentioned hc stocks rose massively in '17 with no change in news (such moves would not happen without a catalyst in the past he said). for anyone looking for fundamental signals there is a lot of trading momentum noise.
1316 2018-12-18 19:52:45 i got 2 bump stocks for hunting. Deer Bear etc.
1317 2018-12-18 19:52:38 I believe he is doing this to distract his base from the Flynn sentencing and the Trump Foundation decision. It'll be 24/7 coverage by his state media outlets on bump stocks and the 2nd amendment.
1318 2018-12-18 19:52:17 Does that make stocks go up?
1319 2018-12-18 19:52:08 On the bright side, Trump actually banned bump stocks, while I don't support him this is a positive first step in regards to reducing gun violence.
1320 2018-12-18 19:51:55 Its not the economy.  Its the Fed.  Liquidity always leads stocks.
1321 2018-12-18 19:51:53 Bump stocks are not guns or ammunition.
1322 2018-12-18 19:51:43 Stocks are well off their highs....investors realize with the Bozo and his clowns in the White House, the economy will likely tank even if the federal Reserve stops hiking interest rates
1323 2018-12-18 19:51:39 Banning bump stocks is like giving street dealers moving sixteenths of rocks decades in prison.  It doesn't do a damned thing to actually solve the core problem.
1324 2018-12-18 19:51:30 Oh NOW you ban bump stocks ! Coincidence ?
1325 2018-12-18 19:51:13 Right on cue, @vanjones is giving Trump credit for plans to ban bump stocks. (they haven't yet) I don't recognise Van any more. To think he worked in Obama WH. He always gives credit to this corrupt WH. They mention 1 thing, and Van is all on board.
1326 2018-12-18 19:51:00 Anyone believe bump stocks will be turned in?
1327 2018-12-18 19:50:31 Leah is a qori ismaris who trades stocks as a day job.
1328 2018-12-18 19:50:22 Trump is banning bump stocks... finally something I can agree with!!!!
1329 2018-12-18 19:50:20 Who cares. I own several ARs and have neither the use or the need of bump stocks. Quit trying to scare people into believing the government is coming to take their guns. Some of them are already scared of their own shadows.
1330 2018-12-18 19:50:13 Doing this and banning bump stocks will not deflect from the fact that you and your administration are under criminal investigation.....good try though. #TraitorTrump #SoTiredofWinning
1331 2018-12-18 19:50:11 But semi-automatic weapons can be manipulated by means other than bump stocks to fit that definition. This really should have come from Congress.
1332 2018-12-18 19:50:08 They banned bump stocks... unreal
1333 2018-12-18 19:50:00 Hmmm..fox (FAUX) news..not a damn thing yet about the banning of bump stocks and the Trump Foundation being dissolved. IMAGINE THAT.
1334 2018-12-18 19:49:52 So, to be clear: The ATF under @BarackObama 's admin found that banning bump stocks would be an overreach.
The ATF under @realDonaldTrump's admin found that banning bump stocks was permissible (and then did it).
But it's the democrats coming for your personal freedoms, right?
1335 2018-12-18 19:49:34 Why isn't the @NRA attacking #GunControlDon for banning bump stocks? I'm a lifetime member for a reason. I want you to attack anyone who threatens our right to bear arms.
1336 2018-12-18 19:49:28 Newtown.
Had nothing to do with bump stocks
1337 2018-12-18 19:49:09 Nintendos stocks literally dropped after bowsette trended on twitter. Investors in general are quite the delicate kind of people
1338 2018-12-18 19:48:49 Do you invest in stocks? #investing #money #AskTwitter
1339 2018-12-18 19:48:38 This is sort of a brilliant move.  Some of the gun control nuts will be happy and the bump stocks are really a non issue.
1340 2018-12-18 19:48:18 If you nice wit the stocks , hmp asap 
1341 2018-12-18 19:47:52 So then they don't need bump stocks.
1342 2018-12-18 19:47:42 Tobacco stocks have been remarkable shorts this year
1343 2018-12-18 19:47:41 Regardless of if people are bullish or bearish...emotions seem to be running high all around right now.  I like that (most of the time) we work together here to educate and inform each other on news and events going on with stocks.  Typically positive.
1344 2018-12-18 19:47:35 Only took me 2 weeks to make 20 cents from stocks. Lmao..
1345 2018-12-18 19:47:18 That must be why manufacturers make money off bump stocks.
1346 2018-12-18 19:47:16 What an odd response to talk about the AR-style rifles when the ban is on bump-stocks, a minor accessory that can be added to many semi-automatic rifles.
1347 2018-12-18 19:46:23 The stocks are pathetic right now
1348 2018-12-18 19:46:09 Or is this all fake news? Do you think it’ll be legal to manufacture or sell bump stocks?
1349 2018-12-18 19:46:08 Every afternoon stocks break it’s like clockwork
1350 2018-12-18 19:45:49 Banning bump stocks isn’t the same as banning guns though. It’s just an unregulated, untraceable modification made to a rifle, so thankfully, guns are still protected and you’re still an idiot. (:
1351 2018-12-18 19:45:45 generally speaking i just don't get the need for complex explanations for a return to average VIX after unprecedented zero-rate period. Stocks got high valuations, some got really high, & now that historic period is likely ending. Why would anything in this moment be "normal?"
1352 2018-12-18 19:45:32 On some days, the stocks do move up .... and then when they reach a handsome level, suddenly they say, "Oh Fuck! What the hell are we thinking, Trump is still in office", and then meekly start retreating.
1353 2018-12-18 19:45:02 Not if he caves on a wall and then bans bump stocks...  #losingbase @realDonaldTrump
1354 2018-12-18 19:44:16 This is not accurate. Bump stocks are stupid, gimmicky contraptions that remove any shred of accuracy from the weapon and allow the shooter to hold their finger stationary while the recoil moves the rifle back and forth mimicking a full auto weapon
1355 2018-12-18 19:44:09 @realDonaldTrump well you just lost a lot of support from millions of Americans after banning bump stocks. Guess I’ll be voting for someone else in 2020.
1356 2018-12-18 19:43:54 You just said the stocks should be banned that’s part of the god given right of the Penis extension and I don’t think the NRA would like that very much.
1357 2018-12-18 19:43:50 A good rule to write down.  You don’t sit in momentum names that are below the 8/21day.  And if your an investor. You don’t own stocks that stay below the 50/200day for more than 3-5 sessions.  They can go anywhere.  $slb $ge sectors #oil. Etc. Etc
1358 2018-12-18 19:43:26 It has been said many times many ways.
I will go long with dividend stocks and reinvest then on the way down or up.  Lucky to have a 10+ year time frame.
1359 2018-12-18 19:43:26 Well, that goes to the separate question of whether such a prohibition would be *effective*.  (Probably not very. But presumably there’s a market for the stocks because *do* they make it somewhat easier to bump-fire consistently.)
1360 2018-12-18 19:43:21 Bump stocks aren't a big item with rifle owners, they're not accurate and waste ammo. Only outlaws will keep them.
1361 2018-12-18 19:43:15 @stocksact playing with stocks is like playing with matches
1362 2018-12-18 19:43:12 They report on stocks every day
1363 2018-12-18 19:43:09 If stocks continued to go up under the trump administration as well ass they did under the Obama administration, we'd be winning.
1364 2018-12-18 19:43:05 Stocks are still up and energy sector hasn't had a chance to say anything. My bet is Texas based companies complain that the low price hurts first
1365 2018-12-18 19:43:02 Please provide an intellectual and practical use for bump stocks.

1368 2018-12-18 19:42:29 hmm Trump banning bum stocks? 

Will THIS be what makes the MAGA rubes realize he isn't really on their side, and never has been?
1369 2018-12-18 19:42:26 2 questions...
Have you heard of bump fire stocks before 10-1-17?
How many acts of violence have been committed w/said device before the date above?
Bonus question Can you provide proof the firearms used in the event on the date above had bump stocks attachment?
1370 2018-12-18 19:42:14 Two major stock indexes, the Dow Jones and the S&P 500, are “on pace for their worst December performance since 1931, when stocks were battered during the Great Depression,” according to CNBC.
1371 2018-12-18 19:42:03 Garbage mining penny stocks are another very important leg of the Canadian stool. It’s called diversification!
1372 2018-12-18 19:41:58 VIX up and stocks up -- so you know we accept the fear.
1373 2018-12-18 19:41:26 Too little too late.      Trump allowed manufacturersto have big sell off by this long delay.      Bump stocks now in hands of all those who wanted to create terror. And also anyone who bought “just in case” they needed to kill or maim humans.
1374 2018-12-18 19:41:19 Time for all those black and blue American flag bumper sticker owners to obey the law and give the government their bump stocks
1375 2018-12-18 19:40:52 What are we getting in return?  I’d take the wall or a ban on 3rd trimester abortions and happily give up bump stocks.

1378 2018-12-18 19:40:02 No @allidoisowen
@realDonaldTrump DOES NOT GET a F for banning BUMP STOCKS.

Still gonna vote for him in 2020.

1379 2018-12-18 19:39:56 With oil trading around here, transportation stocks like $FDX should see massive saving going right to the bottom line. Watch for comments on their conf call.
1380 2018-12-18 19:39:14 That’s because (you don’t have to say it, Emily, I will) MSM loves having Bump Stocks around for maximum killing of people by the sickos. Otherwise they’d lose something to blame on Trump.

1382 2018-12-18 19:39:05 Thank you, Mr. President, for making that BAN on bump stocks happen!!!! We heard it loud and clear from Sarah Sanders today.  Please tweet about that.  I was honestly worried you had forgotten your promise back in March.
1383 2018-12-18 19:38:41 The Oil and Gas biz tanked 5% today - this and not pipelines to be ready in 2021/22 are whats driving unemployment in AB today.  My oil stocks have been in the dumpster for yrs.  You cannot blame PMJT for that.
1384 2018-12-18 19:38:16 LOL..wait til everyone finds out that bump stocks are now banned. THAT'S a GREAT THING BUT I AM SURE HIS TRUMPETEERS WON"T LIKE THAT!
1385 2018-12-18 19:38:09 Thank you for making that BAN on bump stocks happen!!!! We heard it loud and clear from Sarah Sanders today.  Please tweet about that.  I was honestly worried you had forgotten your promise back in March.
1386 2018-12-18 19:38:01 Thank you for making that BAN on bump stocks happen!!!! We heard it loud and clear from Sarah Sanders today.  Please tweet about that.  I was honestly worried you had forgotten your promise back in March.

1388 2018-12-18 19:37:58 These Dow manipulators are now saying we have an oversupply of oil, tech stocks ? Chicoms? Whatever and they drive the Dow down from +300 to now +100.  These people can't stand lower taxes for gas for workers? Yikes.
1389 2018-12-18 19:37:43 In other news, guns owners report a spike in fishing accidents where the only gear lost was bump stocks
1390 2018-12-18 19:37:33 It's a ceiling resistance. Bots kicking there and slow roll any push to go higher. It blitzes all the stocks and all the corresponding ETFs. Just a theory.
1391 2018-12-18 19:37:30 Thank you for making that BAN on bump stocks happen!!!! We heard it loud and clear from Sarah Sanders today.  Please tweet about that.  I was honestly worried you had forgotten your promise back in March.
1392 2018-12-18 19:37:18 #Copper bludgeoned more pre-#Fed.  #crudeoil price is a horror show. #Dollar Index still near its highs. This all assumes that #Fed "Dovish Hike" outcome. If that's what we get tomorrow, and no more, things could get even uglier...and for #stocks, too.
1393 2018-12-18 19:37:18 Do you think they're done? You think because they succeeded in getting bump stocks banned they're gunna leave the rest of our rifles alone? Never go to far in this fight.
1394 2018-12-18 19:36:41 Thanks bro. I aim dow stocks lately and so far so good.
1395 2018-12-18 19:36:39 Definitions matter. The function of a bump stock does not align with the definition of a machine gun. We should be pushing for a repeal of the NFA, not banning bump stocks.
1396 2018-12-18 19:36:21 People have been panicking for 6 months now. Before all is said and done, WTI could be back in the $20's and we could be looking at another 50%+ haircut in Canadian energy stocks.
1397 2018-12-18 19:36:16 Nobody started talking about bump stocks until after the vegas shooting, so no it wouldn’t have been stopped. Personally, bump stocks look like fun to use but seem excessive imo. Also, the 2nd Amendment isn’t in place for “hunting”, a huge misconception many leftists have
1398 2018-12-18 19:36:14 il leur reste les stocks de sérum physiologique et les gilets jaunes confisqués. Le casque, ils l’ont déjà 
1399 2018-12-18 19:36:08 Oil dropped to 47. Watch energy stocks shit the bed tomorrow
1400 2018-12-18 19:35:51 Banning bump stocks. 

The 20,001st gun law.
1401 2018-12-18 19:35:36 haha, I wish. No bro , I have a full time job. But I get to work remotely most of the days. So I put some time into Stocks & share my ideas / trades
1402 2018-12-18 19:35:18 illegal bump stocks?  falling stock market?  no wall?  low number of deportations?  corrupt foundation?  what exactly is trump doing for us?  i want to be on board so please remind me.  
1403 2018-12-18 19:34:38 Well here we go again it’s a bad pattern it starts off the day being incredibly optimistic about how the market is up 200 points versus falling 500 to 600 points every day but then by about this time 2:30 est it starts falling again #Stocks
1404 2018-12-18 19:34:20 I think Trump is trying to shift the blame with this tweet:
1) Powell doesn't hike, showing he is beholden to the president (unlikely)
2) Powell does hike. If stocks crash then Trump can blame Powell.
1405 2018-12-18 19:34:11 Woman wanted to tear me apart for a comment on Rep. Kennedy..I hope it was Joe..having stocks. So what? He is from a wealthy family. SMH.
1406 2018-12-18 19:34:09 And so it begins! The communist now have a toe-hold into eventual confiscation of ALL firearms and eliminating my Constitutional RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS!!! Do you really believe all the bad guys will not have these bump stocks available to them? Of course they will! BAD LAW!!!!!
1407 2018-12-18 19:33:53 Det är något som de som försöker skärpa vapenlagarna har velat få igenom länge.
De flesta skjutningar som ägt rum har inte haft bump stocks, halvautomatiska vapen kan göra stor skada ändå, men Las Vegas är den numerärt värsta massakern här, och bump stocks var en stor anledning.
1408 2018-12-18 19:33:10 Nasdaq rallies despite most stocks trading lower
1409 2018-12-18 19:32:48 Oooooohhh liberals scary. Lattes are dangerous. Some of us are armed with birkenstocks instead of rifle stocks. I'd call that an improvement.
1410 2018-12-18 19:32:45 The Trump administration just banned bump stocks...wait, hold on, did he just do something that makes sense?
1411 2018-12-18 19:32:37 LIberal DOJ can't wait to take away bump stocks. Trump needs to fire most of the DOJ leadership. @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @SaraCarterDC @JackPosobiec @charliekirk11 @RealJamesWoods @DRUDGE_REPORT @rushlimbaugh
1412 2018-12-18 19:32:34 The only thing beginning is lawsuits challenging #TrumpStockBan as an illegal regulation, a gross misapplication of current law and how bump stocks work, and deprivation of property without due process
1413 2018-12-18 19:32:27 Thank heavens for that should have been done months ago!
As a gun owner and hunter certainly agree with banning Bump Stocks!
1414 2018-12-18 19:32:19 Bye bye bump stocks ‍
1415 2018-12-18 19:31:49 Math.  Numbers.  Science.

All meaningless.  

Trump's gut sees the market as buy, buy, buy.

Stocks.  Buy.  Real Estate.  Buy.  Weapons.  Buy.  Russian Whores.  Buy. Guns.  Buy.
1416 2018-12-18 19:31:47 Thank you
1417 2018-12-18 19:31:41 On banning bump stocks, Sanders says people have until March 2019 to turn them in or have them destroyed. Says they fall under same guidelines as machine guns.

1423 2018-12-18 19:30:25 In spite of @realDonaldTrump's recent re-election ad touting his successes, as an Ind, I see the banning of bump stocks as his only truly helpful action in 2 years - albeit, really late to the table. But, "better late than never!"

1431 2018-12-18 19:29:18 .@NRA ... I know your organization has no issue with banning bumps stocks but are you at least going to stand up against FORCING people who complied with then existing law turning those legally bought items in? #2ndAmendment
1432 2018-12-18 19:28:46 For all the outrage & defense over bump stocks & gun regs, the protests for & against, the depth to which citizens feel about #2A-

1433 2018-12-18 19:28:44 @dwyerstrategy Prof Saut "day 9 of what feel's a selling stampede typically lasting 17-25 days."  Considering recently his 3200 by EOY a major failure (so far), stampede very well b 35+ days. Regardless, likely post FED stocks dive much lower. 2200 SPX makes lots of sense to me.
1434 2018-12-18 19:28:36 you buy the belly on a dovish hike but rates still go up

1436 2018-12-18 19:28:12 God will bless you and 2019 is gonna be an amazing year for you already. Actually tweeted something like this, about needing someone to lead me on how to get into buying stocks, TB and bearer bonds. Just got my answer. Thanks
1437 2018-12-18 19:28:08 At least we have a ban on bump stocks, if upheld by the courts in response to #NRA challenge. If necessary, change Federal law to uphold #bumpstockban

1439 2018-12-18 19:27:59 I agree with u on this but I have personally seen in many companies that data and facts differs from eachother.
I can give u many e.g. on this even in blue chip companies and as far as pabrai's stake in this, if u go by his history and study W.Buffet's top 70 to 100 stocks.

1441 2018-12-18 19:27:36 I think living in a debt free manner could set you up for this lifestyle if you invest in good stocks or real estate (bought in cash) . You would have to inherit a significant amount or have parents that had this mindset so you don't carry debt out of college.
1442 2018-12-18 19:27:36 There’s a Stockbroker in my city who pushes trash stocks on seniors by saying “President Trump called This Stock ‘The Eighth Wonder of the World.’” He said it almost always works because only idiot Trump voters wait until they’re on Social Security to think about investing.

1445 2018-12-18 19:27:16 Thank you for abandoning wall funding and banning bump stocks today, #TreasonWeasel!
1446 2018-12-18 19:26:41 Big step in the right direction as the Justice Department has officially moved to ban bump stocks under federal law 
1447 2018-12-18 19:26:31 NRA says the ATF should review bump stocks, not the Justice Dept.
At the same time, they oppose any legislation from ANYONE in Congress to review bump stocks. 
Meanwhile, back in reality, bump stocks still fire like an automatic machine gun. But it is, but it's not. 
Lobbyists..

1450 2018-12-18 19:26:06 @realDonaldTrump 
Bump stocks don't make AR's machine guns it is multiple trigger pulls. NOT ONE. Therefore it is not a machine gun and shouldn't be banned
1451 2018-12-18 19:25:49 Bump stocks????  Nobody has any.
1452 2018-12-18 19:25:35 Bump stocks don't kill people, the other part does
1453 2018-12-18 19:25:02 better get rid of oliver stocks
1454 2018-12-18 19:24:49 @CamEdwards Tomorrow Trump will ban bumper cars which will have the same affect on auto accidents that banning bump stocks will have on gun deaths. We love tackling things that are easy and never those problems which take actual thought.
1455 2018-12-18 19:24:39 Asos is listed on AIM at the moment & we only have LSE listed stocks. We’re trying to find a way to add them though..
1456 2018-12-18 19:24:03 In this market where stocks can consistently go -5% for 5 days in a row with no reasons at all, a valuation of 7M for an entire drug class and 5 billions in milestones sounds reasonable, right?
1457 2018-12-18 19:23:57 @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox so what is y'alls excuse for Trump banning bump stocks huh?
1458 2018-12-18 19:23:56 YOU’RE ON STOCKS TANK THAT SHIT PUSSY
1459 2018-12-18 19:23:51 Interesting that stocks have been up today with risky credit still languishing.
1460 2018-12-18 19:23:48 Don’t take this the wrong way but what stocks has @CitronResearch pumped?
1461 2018-12-18 19:23:44 More borrowed $trillions for the US war machine.  Make sure you're invested in war, er I mean, defense stocks.   Making America Great Again, one giant deficit at a time.
1462 2018-12-18 19:23:28 There is no possible way they could have been used in Vegas. Bump stocks make firing so inaccurate and makes aiming effectively over a long distance impossible
1463 2018-12-18 19:23:10 Bump stocks are now banned? HUH
1464 2018-12-18 19:22:57 So no wall funding, plenty of money for planned parenthood, and the WH wants to ban bump stocks. Starting to not feel the love here.
1465 2018-12-18 19:22:54 Wait what? How is getting rid of bump stocks unconstitutional?
1466 2018-12-18 19:21:45 The whole thing is silly anyhow. It's not like bump stocks are being used regularly in crimes. We don't even have any evidence they were used in Las Vegas. Much bigger fish to fry to reduce violence, IMO.

1472 2018-12-18 19:20:40 Investor sentiment has turned substantially. Oil stocks are where they were in the 2008 crisis. Oil prices have fallen so fast it’s scared many. NG prices have firmed and could spike from here (low storage) if Oil prices don’t firm in 4-6 weeks very hard times will ensue
1473 2018-12-18 19:20:30 from pure technical standpoint, to counter ystd's huge red candle, mkt and individual stocks need to close ABOVE ystd's open price with a mid to big green candle. NFLX NVDA GOOGL all fit into this category. AMZN not, nor were ES NQ.
1474 2018-12-18 19:20:15 Trump's day so far: 

#Flynnsentencing: #generalflynn admits guilt, Judge says ""arguably, you sold your country out"
Bump stocks banned 
No #governmentshutdown for taxpayer-funding of the #borderwall
#TRUMPFOUNDATION SHUT DOWN for its "shocking pattern of illegality"
1475 2018-12-18 19:20:13 The Emperor just officially banned bump stocks.
1476 2018-12-18 19:20:09 I have my doubts that this bump stock ban will work, legally. They're relying on a questionable definition of machine gun. Bump stocks don't convert a semi-auto to full-auto; they just make it possible to pull the trigger more rapidly (but not with any accuracy).
1477 2018-12-18 19:20:03 Wow look at this oil move.  Oil stocks getting creamed too.
1478 2018-12-18 19:20:00 Well since bump stocks are now banned Republicans are now resorting to throwing rocks which they learned via assimilation prtectin our borders
1479 2018-12-18 19:19:32 A lot of the money is in mutual funds or etf’s, but investments in stocks grow faster than fixed income, that is one reason the rich get richer
1480 2018-12-18 19:19:25 looks like MJ stocks on the daily
1481 2018-12-18 19:19:23 But it still doesn’t change my position that the constitution didn’t have to be amended over bump stocks, and ppl can’t get upset over one law being broken but justify breaking another one.  Maybe they should provide compensation?  I certainly don’t know if they will or not.
1482 2018-12-18 19:18:58 what about nunchucks with bump stocks?
1483 2018-12-18 19:18:54 Santa Rallies tended to get later and later each year and tend to be concentrated in a few stocks. One area which seemed likely is ones with Institutional overhangs where they go on holiday and double whammy of end to overhang + news can see decent late year moves.
1484 2018-12-18 19:18:52 Reported here many times on the news.  The gun he used with it jammed so he used another high powered rifle.  If you google the shooting you will see it was reported that he had anywhere from 17 to42 guns and from 1 tp 12 bump stocks. Not a fan of bump stocks or fake news.
1485 2018-12-18 19:18:38 Le acaban de hacer 3 stocks a zero en fg xddddddd
1486 2018-12-18 19:18:30 If you have Bump Stocks, have to turn them in w/n 90 days.
1487 2018-12-18 19:18:23 Watch, Trump Adminstration bans bump stocks and that will not be enough. They want the guns.

#NOMORECONCESSIONS
1488 2018-12-18 19:18:14 Left: We need Bump Stocks banned
Trump: Done
Left: you're clearly covering something up
1489 2018-12-18 19:17:27 Yup, he's crawfishin' on the wall and banning bump stocks too.
1490 2018-12-18 19:17:14 fight me on stocks like it should be lmao
1491 2018-12-18 19:16:59 Also you've built up your stocks of cynicism and expectation of rejection.
1492 2018-12-18 19:16:58 Our current view of the market: as the tax loss selling period ends and central banks ease up on rate hikes, we see opportunities in US financials & Canadian energy stocks. Many of these stocks have declined too much.
1493 2018-12-18 19:16:37 Hyde invested in bitcoin while the stocks were still high
1494 2018-12-18 19:16:25 They didn't even define how it works correctly, they stated bump stocks allow you to fire more than once with each trigger pull which is absolutely false. It uses the weapons recoil to speed up how fast you pull the trigger. This isn't going anywhere.
1495 2018-12-18 19:15:53 @SenJeffMerkley Thanks Jeff, the idea to not allow members in Congress to not have stocks is a great idea to reduce corruption in politics.
1496 2018-12-18 19:15:35 AND he said he loves secular growth stocks.

1498 2018-12-18 19:15:03 Well, of course not mentioning that it's us who have polluted the rivers and lakes, used enethical, unsafe and over fishing methods thereby dwindling the stocks available> creating the shortage thereby causing importation to meet the increased demand.
1499 2018-12-18 19:15:02 Criminals aren't long-term thinkers, and the type of mass killers you're talking about regarding bump stocks (Vegas) aren't going to care what the law says. He intended to die that night. If he really wanted a bump stock, no law was going to be able to stop him.

1502 2018-12-18 19:14:24 Furthermore, you're going way off the subject to try and feel like you'rr accomplishing something. Bump stocks was the issue here. Focus.

1506 2018-12-18 19:13:48 Without any major catalyst, I see this drifting back down to the low teens, possibly into around $10s-$11s.  The reason is that stocks that go up high usually drop about 50% after the catalyst is over.  It's possible a buyout can still happen, but the charts don't lie.
1507 2018-12-18 19:13:44 I wonder how many safe space snowflakes on here that thank Obama when stocks go up will blame him when stocks go down? Thought so.

1514 2018-12-18 19:12:42 Whoever is getting Trump to go along with banning bump stocks and agreeing to not shut down the government for a stupid xenophobic wall, thank you.

(You will never convince me that Trump is doing this willingly by his own conscience. 72 years of stupid doesn’t change overnight.)
1515 2018-12-18 19:12:38 @realDonaldTrump stop this maddening assault on our second amendment sir. Leave the bump stocks legal...you are going to loose the people who got you elected...many of my pro gun friends are furious about this ban. No they don't use them but its the principle of it, sir...
1516 2018-12-18 19:12:30 Bump stocks should not be banned because one liberal asshole used one to carry out mass murder

Bump Stocks are now illegal. Next outlawed will be rubber bands.

1523 2018-12-18 19:11:16 Bump stocks will be illegal March 21st. Brexit is March 29th. 
Coincidence? 
I DON'T THINK SO! :D
1524 2018-12-18 19:11:14 And we did hear that you suddenly have forbidden bump stocks today.

You were probably hoping that the turmoil around the Flynn (not yet) sentencing and your foundation shutdown would blow enough smoke to distract your guncrazed base and the NRA.
1525 2018-12-18 19:11:08 Do not come to my page threaten me if you are a military officer involved in that corrupt deal who did not research it or did not care because they owned stocks in this company.
1526 2018-12-18 19:11:05 Trump ordered the Justice Department to ban the devices in March. The department followed up by proposing a federal rule change that would reclassify bump stocks so they fell under the definition of a "machine gun," as it's now doing.
1527 2018-12-18 19:11:04 @Dominos_UK just wondering where the closest dominos to Northampton is which stocks Vegan cheese, rang the Weston Favell Brand and they said they dont know of any nearby

1529 2018-12-18 19:10:49 It's interesting. I have been following the stock market for around 6 years now, and I have never experienced a bear market. I have people that I follow and listen to about investing and stocks, but I truly have no clue how good they are...
1530 2018-12-18 19:10:41 WTB bump stocks
1531 2018-12-18 19:10:25 .@PressSec just announced that @realDonaldTrump is banning "bump stocks"—and that existing ones must be turned in or destroyed by March 2019.

If Obama had done this, the NRA and gun-rights activists would have lost their damn minds. Wonder what their reaction to this will be?

1535 2018-12-18 19:10:16 Also the ban of Bump Stocks by the Federal Government is a breach of 10th Admen. Right?
1536 2018-12-18 19:10:14 What is that based on? Just a general vague feeling of dislike? I saw the point as contrasting the fact that the rules clearly make accepting even a $100gc as wrong (good), but allows MoC’s to make millions on stocks (bad). Put it in perspective. Advocate for stricter rules.
1537 2018-12-18 19:09:55 I’m a proud owner of multiple firearms and fully understand how bump stocks work. The amended regulations reverse a 2010 ATF decision that found bump stocks did not amount to machine guns and could not be regulated unless Congress changed existing firearms law or passed a new one
1538 2018-12-18 19:09:44 Just a possible outcome on the "slippery slope" of banning bump stocks.
1539 2018-12-18 19:09:26 The White House just outlawed bump stocks. Must be destroyed by March 21st #NRA
1540 2018-12-18 19:09:21 How many Trumpkins will actually turn in their bump stocks? 
1541 2018-12-18 19:09:20 Bump stocks are now illegal. You have 90 days to surrender them to law enforcement.
1542 2018-12-18 19:09:20 Just nu: president Trump gör ”bump stocks” olagliga och alla som har sådana har 90 dagar på sig att lämna in eller förstöra dem.

1547 2018-12-18 19:09:00 Next Week Trump will try to copywright the name "Trump Stocks" and bring them back on the market and claim they're completely different than a "bump stock".
1548 2018-12-18 19:08:58 Sadly trump needed a quick excuse, or a quick "solution" for the las vegas shooting (since he wasnt told or cant talk about the main reason), so he had to point the finger at bump stocks.
1549 2018-12-18 19:08:56 Under a new federal rule announced Tuesday by the Justice Department, bump stocks will be redefined as "machine guns" and therefore outlawed under existing law.  It will take effect 90 days after being published in the Federal Register. #BumpStockOutlawed
1550 2018-12-18 19:08:52 Trump bans bump stocks
1551 2018-12-18 19:08:51 Really @PressSec? You're starting with the World Economic Forum? Oh, bump stocks...ok next..Martha McSally...aaaaaand questions. Just bypass that whole treason thing!
1552 2018-12-18 19:08:47 Despicable.  You disagree on stocks, then argue about it and leave it at that.  Encouraging people to harass someone in person?  That's Trotsky line leftist bullshit.  Not acceptable and I hope this person gets their Twitter access restricted.
1553 2018-12-18 19:08:45 Casually banning bump stocks to keep the media’s eyes off Flynn and Trump?
1554 2018-12-18 19:08:43 If bump stocks were a constitutional right than they would have to amend the constitution.  So, you know better about this than the courts?  And if you do, does that mean you can make up all your own laws?
1555 2018-12-18 19:08:35 "Stocks Rebounding From Monday's Selloff' is not a very accurate headline for this market action.
1556 2018-12-18 19:08:31 RT winknews:

1569 2018-12-18 19:06:11 Because they enjoy wasting money on ammo and missing their targets I guess. I think bump stocks are retarded and useless. The only reason I'm against the ban is because I know the people who support it are not acting in good faith with Gun Owners. It was never about bump stocks.
1570 2018-12-18 19:06:08 Just a paid schill for the FANG stocks trying to downplay what it costs to maintain a real network vs. getting stuff for free/cheap from the FANG by donating his privacy to their cause.

1573 2018-12-18 19:05:53 Trump banned bump stocks? OMG.. today is the first time he has ever done ANYTHING I agree with.  THIS is my DAY that will live in infamy.
1574 2018-12-18 19:05:24 Global financial system is in a state of collapse. Many bank stocks are down over 90% since 2007. Deutsche Bank is down 94%. European Banking Index STOXX 600 has lost 75% since 2007, and in 2018 it is has collapsed by 1/3. IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE FROM HERE
1575 2018-12-18 19:05:24 Time to go buy a couple of "bump stocks" and "AR"...lol I can't help it, The US is going full retard, you never go full retard.
1576 2018-12-18 19:05:12 Deep State is up now about 6-0... Hillary hearing was a joke... Comey hearings both were a joke... Strzok has not been charged... Rosenstein still at DOJ... Mueller still getting drunk on taxpayer tab... Flynn hearing a circus... My advice: Sell stocks and forget about it all.
1577 2018-12-18 19:04:48 Trump Administration bans Bump Stocks thank you Democrats and Robert Mueller the hot is on and Trump starting to crack pressure on he will to back down like a little pussy what happens Trump not so Tough now
1578 2018-12-18 19:04:31 but you guys aren't getting one because Trump backed down yet again. You guys are laughing stocks
1579 2018-12-18 19:04:28 By banning Bump Stocks, The bigoted Russian puppet has just infringed on gun owners more than President Obama did in eight years. God, the irony is orgasmic!
1580 2018-12-18 19:04:24 Should not specific to any stocks on eventful basis but it's good for equity market whereas investors will more focus on T-yield spread rather than equity segment.
1581 2018-12-18 19:04:19 GUN CONTROL: Bump stocks will be banned under a federal law that prohibits machine guns, according to a senior Justice Department official.
1582 2018-12-18 19:03:37 Confiscation and criminalization by executive fiat is more dangerous than a billion bump stocks.
1583 2018-12-18 19:03:18 I am a big enough man to give credit where it is due.  Bump Stocks should be illegal and I am glad that will be the case.
1584 2018-12-18 19:03:17 "US stocks have fluctuated drastically during President Trump's tenure"... is not a remotely accurate statement. Should be corrected to say 2018...but even that is debatable depending on the measure.
1585 2018-12-18 19:03:13 Y’all remember when bitcoin had people thinking about investments, and stocks. That was wild
1586 2018-12-18 19:03:11 Not sure if it is low light season for humans or dive in cannabis stocks, but the digital frustration is running hot these last few weeks! 

Unsolicited advice: be kind. The internet is not your scratching post.
1587 2018-12-18 19:02:45 Monkey boy we all know that you short stocks. $NHPI will make a monster run any day now. You spend all day bashing $NHPI with your friends on IHUB so the price can drop. Why? Tell us why you do it?
1588 2018-12-18 19:02:18 Indeed which is enabling them to revel over this perceived victory while they are cheering away their rights which sets the precedent for any personal property to be declared bad and destroyed without compensation. This is a dangerous precedent that emotion of bump stocks hides.
1589 2018-12-18 19:01:51 This "good" economy only benefits those with stocks and retirement plans not diminished by the big corporations. The rest of the country is still just trying to live paycheck to paycheck while the jobs are dwindling and the farms are going under.
1590 2018-12-18 19:01:45 Or registration remedy.

I think bump stocks are stupid toys of little to no self-defense value, and any martial value is highly suspect. 

But it should be legislation not regulation.
1591 2018-12-18 19:01:45 Hi Dear buddy @CholericCleric hows you? Hope all's well with ur health, work, stocks n everything else. Besta Luck
1592 2018-12-18 19:01:43 Trump administration officially bans bump stocks!  Good work!
1593 2018-12-18 19:01:43 So who wants to be long stocks into FOMC tomorrow?
1594 2018-12-18 19:01:42 @realDonaldTrump and his administration have finally done something right, although I believe he’s grasping at straws. They are banning bump stocks effective in March everyone has to either destroy or can hand them in. Gun lobby is not happy and are going to fight this.
1595 2018-12-18 19:01:28 Avec vos deux milliards vous êtes très loin du compte La perte est beaucoup plus importante et plus grave les marges vont s’écrouler pendant les soldes promotions de Janvier Les stocks à écouler sont considérables et les prix massacrés il faut prévoir des dépôts de bilan massifs
1596 2018-12-18 19:01:25 I guess people have to go back to using the string system for their bump stocks
1597 2018-12-18 19:01:25 Like limiting access to bump stocks? That wouldn't have saved people in Vegas? That would have harmed normal people who just really wanted to use bump stocks to fend off intruders? It would have harmed hunters?
1598 2018-12-18 19:01:22 I'm pro-2A, but against these stocks.  They're unsafe, and frankly... stupid.
1599 2018-12-18 19:01:22 All of a sudden leftists support bump stocks.
1600 2018-12-18 19:01:18 @jimcramer why are tobacco stocks getting so crushed in the last year? #mo #pm #bti
1601 2018-12-18 19:00:49 If you use two stocks in ultimate ur dumb cause I'll just kill you quicker
1602 2018-12-18 19:00:37 Worst stocks? All of them?
1603 2018-12-18 19:00:23 I also wish I could have attended. I have to wait for the YouTube posting to find out the considered stocks.
1604 2018-12-18 19:00:20 Steve, I just want my stocks to go up for Christmas. Please?
1605 2018-12-18 19:00:18 Gold stocks breaking out! My 12month target for $GDXJ is 55.
$GLD $HUI $GDX
1606 2018-12-18 19:00:10 The Ban of Bumb stocks is a: #BadTrump moment @realDonaldTrump @GOP
1607 2018-12-18 18:59:58 There isn’t a buyout clause in his new contract, but the manager fee is 34 million pounds that’s nothing for Manchester United. We just spent 20 million + on Jose to get sacked. 

Plus we just earned 100 million in stocks because of the sacking of Jose Mourinho which is mad tbh.
1608 2018-12-18 18:59:54 Ooh I’m triggered? nope I’m laughing at you while providing facts!! We do agree on bump stocks though.
1609 2018-12-18 18:59:51 Trump administration officially bans bump stocks!!!!! NRA must be very proud.  GOOD WORK!!
1610 2018-12-18 18:59:39 @DLoesch Why are you not outraged that the government is going to confiscate bump stocks?? The @NRA has been warning us about jack-booted thugs coming to take out guns away for decades, but now that it is really happening, you all are silent. Why??
1611 2018-12-18 18:59:29 Wealth creates wealth. So the question is will this future business owner be able to accumulate enough money to comfortably buy stocks? Maybe, maybe not. Hard to gamble money with high overheads and small profit margins.
1612 2018-12-18 18:59:24 So I have switch money now but I'm going to invest it instead in stocks and print money away towards assets like a new camera and maybe some plugins, also don't for a mix deck. Fuck them video games man I'm really tryna live better
1613 2018-12-18 18:59:07 @Turner_T8126 People dumb if they think banning bump stocks gonna change something
1614 2018-12-18 18:59:03 Well, if u remember, Obama had the chance to eliminate bump stocks.... but he made the decision not to when it was put before him.  We know who the real, traitorous criminals are, and it is not the Trump family.
1615 2018-12-18 18:58:56 This is ridiculous. We can have a space force but no wall? I am beyond disgusted today.  All of these promises and nothing.  Had time to ban bump stocks but still haven’t seen all of the facts about the LV shooting-but we can continue to erode 2A.
1616 2018-12-18 18:58:47 Do not come to my page threaten me if you are a military officer involved in that corrupt deal who did not research it or did not care because they owned stocks in this company
1617 2018-12-18 18:58:43 Of course staying on the topic doesn't work for Democrats. They'd never win an argument if they did that. Thank you Trump for making America safer and banning bump stocks
1618 2018-12-18 18:58:37 Buy gold. The day is coming when gold and silver markets will once again see regular daily moves of well over 3% and 5% as they resume their market advances, as deflation in financial market assets such as stocks and bonds inspire fear and loathing in the hearts of their owners.
1619 2018-12-18 18:58:10 yes, Nasdaq, growth stocks are more defensive to hide in
1620 2018-12-18 18:57:57 Didn't buffet back the truck up in bank stocks after he loaded appl up to 230
1621 2018-12-18 18:57:47 Democracy is making a comeback today. Not dead yet!
1. Trump foundation shut down.
2. Flynn might go to jail after all unless he gives prosecution more and puts the final nails into Trumps casket. 
3. Justice dept bans Bump stocks
 
1622 2018-12-18 18:57:39 I know the EURO is going no where but if were to move it has to be higher... We have been beating up on the euro for 6 months partly because of Italy and now that risk is gone spreads banks stocks will move tom and will be euro positive ...
1623 2018-12-18 18:57:30 I bet the New Russian America also known as NRA is really scared now as a Republican House, Senate and President just banned Bump stocks.  They have no one left other than complete morons.  Karma is really being nasty to these idiots.  I just love the hell out of it.
1624 2018-12-18 18:57:30 We did it. We got another win. Even something as small as Trump banning bump stocks can be considered a win.
1625 2018-12-18 18:57:19 It’s typical tRump. He took credit for the market rise, but will blame everything & everyone else for the coming crash.
Wealthy people do not invest their money in the stocks of bankrupt countries.
1626 2018-12-18 18:57:15 Are all AR’s equipped with bump stocks?
1627 2018-12-18 18:57:07 Its still to risky, we have no data on what this effluent will do to native fish stocks over hundreds of generations. Mutations still are possible and while the fish stocks might show no factors we don't conclusively know what it does to there eggs. See Eagles and DDT
1628 2018-12-18 18:57:02 Stupid and unnecessary. Anyone that’s ever used a bump stock, knows they’re gimmicky garbage. What happened in LV had nothing to do with bump stocks. Funny how all that just vanished and you don’t hear anything about it anymore.
1629 2018-12-18 18:56:49 Today, we saw:
1) Flynn sentencing delayed another 90 days
2) Trump caves on $5 billion for wall in budget
3) Trump Foundation is shut down
4) Trump bans bump stocks
"Trust The Plan" my ass. I still totally support President Trump but this has been a lousy day.
1630 2018-12-18 18:56:12 Everyone realizes this is another hoax, right? I wonder how much of these politicians portfolios have been divested of any dino juice stocks? 
1631 2018-12-18 18:56:00 Such a strange day. $HYG off the lows now while stocks nearing theirs
1632 2018-12-18 18:55:51 Bump stocks are stupid.
1633 2018-12-18 18:55:50 Buy weed stocks .... ur welcome
1634 2018-12-18 18:55:35 Trump administration officially bans bump stocks in light of Trump directive after Las Vegas shooting. PO-23TU
1635 2018-12-18 18:55:31 It doesn’t matter what you think of bump stocks. If you are ok with the HOW of this, you are what needs to go. We don’t need kings and we don’t need people who want them either.
1636 2018-12-18 18:55:18 WTF is a supposed value analyst doing talking up Tesla Motors? Most value stocks have consistent earnings, consistent free cash flow or there's a reasonable turnaround path towards those things
1637 2018-12-18 18:55:15 I have taken marzipan to my sister (at Christmas!). When she's back in UK she stocks up on clothes, shoes and books. All available in NZ but pricey.
1638 2018-12-18 18:55:10 I have no problem in banning bump stocks. I think they’re tasteless and make most attentive and responsible gun owners get clumped in with the irresponsible stereotype. I was all for banning these when the dems suggested it after the parkland shooting
1639 2018-12-18 18:54:53 Wow the trump org has to dissolve, Flynn may be charged with treason, and bump stocks will be illegal in 90 days. Holy crap
1640 2018-12-18 18:54:49 Notice how Ed completely disregards Trump banning bump stocks? I rest my case 
1641 2018-12-18 18:54:39 Ok now can we ban Trump stocks next?
1642 2018-12-18 18:54:34 La PESADA HERENCIA de la industria:

1645 2018-12-18 18:53:51 if you told me a year ago that right-wing media would have more to say about overturning a ban on nunchucks than they would about initiating a ban on bump stocks ... actually i might have believed you, these people are dumb as hell
1646 2018-12-18 18:53:51 R.I.P. bump stocks
1647 2018-12-18 18:53:50 That's why 60%of our fish stocks go to other EU nations in Norway it's 15%...no that just means we either acquiesced or were outvoted, you call winning paying half a trillion £'s to these chancers...go right ahead.
1648 2018-12-18 18:53:41 I wanna get into stocks but I need that thing broken down to me like I’m in second grade yo lol
1649 2018-12-18 18:53:25 Plenty has changed, it's just not the "mile" that you want yet, but we all know that's what you're agitating for. You don't care about bump stocks. You even admit that you don't know that the bump stock ban will save anyone at all, but you support it because you want that mile.
1650 2018-12-18 18:53:25 Ahaa Trump trying to ban bump stocks, only gonna make sales go up and trust come down.
1651 2018-12-18 18:53:18 Wages up average 2.7% per month. Stock market has nothing to do with trade war. The banks have been dumping their stocks. Prices of food has been going down by a very small percentage.
1652 2018-12-18 18:53:17 The Trump administration is officially banning so-called bump stocks – an attachment that allows semiautomatic rifles to fire more rapidly.
1653 2018-12-18 18:53:15 Gotta ban those evil bump stocks because criminals obey laws. /s

1658 2018-12-18 18:52:08 Anti-gun ignorants will praise this as a win. The reality is bump stocks are seldom used by anyone and their affects can be replicated by anyone with a a semi-auto gun by utilizing the weapon against any fixed object. This is the result of feelings and ignorance over common sense
1659 2018-12-18 18:51:45 For over a decade, the @NRA LIED to us saying that @BarackObama was going to take our guns away. Today, @realDonaldTrump, who the NRA supported, banned bump stocks. Obama was good to the NRA, while Trump is literally ordering the government to confiscate firearm accessories.
1660 2018-12-18 18:51:41 Since we won't be talking to local, state or federal law enforcemnent about our unfortunate canoe accident they consult our lawyer for information concerning the disposition of novelty bump stocks...
1661 2018-12-18 18:51:17 we are talking about bump stocks. The vegas shooting would not take so many lives is there were not bump stocks. I am not arguing that there are idiots who will kill other people without any reason, we are talking about how to make it down somehow..
1662 2018-12-18 18:50:32 Liz I want to qualify this by saying I am an NRA Member, Strong Supporter of the 2nd Amendment and a fan of yours. Bump stocks simulate automatic fire increasing dramatically the cyclical firing rate equivalent to an automatic. There is no other use or goal. Even I know this.
1663 2018-12-18 18:50:30 Thanks and that’s why you start with the free stock they give you and you let that money flip it self ... I started with 1 stock and now I have 4 stocks with out investing any of my own money  so give it another try use my promo code to get the free stock
1664 2018-12-18 18:50:28 Very beautiful. I will say the mainstream media got this wrong.  Oh, and tell your husband thank you for working to ban bump stocks.
1665 2018-12-18 18:50:17 My husband and I lost nothing in this, because he's an economist and saw it coming, so he moved our money out of stocks. He understands the numbers that are meaningless to you.
1666 2018-12-18 18:50:16 And trump banned bump stocks!!
1667 2018-12-18 18:49:59 You said you’d ban assault weapons but only one gun in that picture is considered an assault weapon in my state. In reality they are all the same with just different stocks.
1668 2018-12-18 18:49:33 IF the Fed. does not hike the FFR tomorrow it will be a resounding NO CONFIDENCE vote for the "strong economy" narrative- stocks will dive. A hike here is BULLISH for stocks.
1669 2018-12-18 18:49:08 You guys basically banned an accessory  bump stocks won't effect AR 15s or any other semi

1672 2018-12-18 18:48:54 Are bump stocks regulated?  How do they plan to implement it?

1675 2018-12-18 18:47:12 This is way overduen but better late than never. Those disgusting companies selling bump stocks should be sued into bankruptcy.
1676 2018-12-18 18:46:55 Two years of shorting on stocks, currency and the dead cat bounce, the whole country has been devalued.  You know why these creeps want to stretch it out don't you?  They're cleverer than they look.
1677 2018-12-18 18:46:23 multiple reports of people handily landing it 3 times in a match for 3 stocks, the DI on nair being minimalistic, and the relative safety and reach of the grab all indicate this is in fact, kind of unga.
1678 2018-12-18 18:46:13 I'm fine with this. And as a "gun guy", I didn't even know they existed prior to LV. That being said, it's not like bump stocks are super technical. And it will do zero to reduce violence, of any sort.
1679 2018-12-18 18:46:12 and bump stocks banned, and Flynn debunked Trump's tricked by the FBI theory, and Trump shown to steal from charities...

It's been an ok day, huh?

1682 2018-12-18 18:45:52 Bump stocks have never been used in a mass shooting, until they were "found" in paddock's room. What else was found in paddock's room? Womens clothing, drills, tools, spent .308 rounds (no mention of spent 5.56 or 7.62 rounds)
1683 2018-12-18 18:45:48 @realDonaldTrump day:

1684 2018-12-18 18:45:31 Deficit & debt already through roof... thanks to Obama who doubled the "unconscionable" 8T left by Bush. Stocks crashing ? No, just retreating, after phenomenal rise since (Potus) Trump, what would you expect? Best jobs numbers in 50 years and you re complaining ?.......
1685 2018-12-18 18:45:30 I assume that’s true for stocks... I want the math they use for bonds
1686 2018-12-18 18:45:28 And having faltering pun stocks is no whey to live.
1687 2018-12-18 18:44:56 And no one cares. Bump stocks are not in compliance with existing law. Most that heard Obama legalized them was shocked. Many thought Obama did it to paint all guns with the anti gun bias. He hoped someone would use the BS to kill people. Someone did. His hope was realized.
1688 2018-12-18 18:44:36 except you can do the SAME thing w/ a belt/belt loop. I'm in favor or banning bump stocks fwiw, but its meaningless if you care about stopping gun violence
1689 2018-12-18 18:44:33 Just taking a few sensible steps.  Keeping coffee stocks up to a 12 week supply, ditto tea.  Maintaining stock of pasta and rice. Keeping the tins cupboard and freezers full.  Mrs H also had me buy a stock of toilet roll, she thinks that we’re going full Venezuela.

1693 2018-12-18 18:42:55 @CivilRights Pertinent questions to the outlawing of Bump Stocks of which I don't own? 1. Will there be police raids after checking records for sales with many expected citizens dying and 2. Will trigger fingers be outlawed, also, which anyone with a semi-auto has used? :-)
1694 2018-12-18 18:42:53 On blocking bump stocks.  It's about damm time.
1695 2018-12-18 18:42:49 Banning bump stocks is the most useless thing anyone has ever done
1696 2018-12-18 18:42:27 i touched stocks in 2017 frenzy and forgot to get out ..
1697 2018-12-18 18:42:20 Prabhuuu!!! Charan kahan hai? I am your bhak(t) now.

Ok pls pls predict for me the prices of BTC, stocks and oil and & also gold and wait ...should I start business, this year? Pls prabhuuu tell me no!
1698 2018-12-18 18:42:17 Some please tell trump that we are not idiots banning bump stocks won’t get it, get those AR-15’s off our streets
1699 2018-12-18 18:42:13 I appreciate the spirit of this article, but we must be cognizant of where the product marketing is coming from. It's not from stock investors. There are now more ETFs than stocks and 70 times more stock indexes than stocks.
1700 2018-12-18 18:42:10 Basically if I told you that stocks had the same return expectation as cash, but stocks had a vol of 15% vs 0% would you reduce your exposure to stocks? At what vol does that diversification matter less?
1701 2018-12-18 18:41:54 This says zero about bump stocks.
Congratulations on being #FakeNews
1702 2018-12-18 18:41:27 Its hollo bump stocks types of likes.....
1703 2018-12-18 18:41:11 Could someone explain to me what a bump stock is? I'm not a gun guy really, I can shoot because I was taught. I can disassemble and assemble most carbine rifles and handguns. I know what buffer springs are and what they do. Are bump stocks for recoil or faster trigger pull?
1704 2018-12-18 18:41:10 So an index fund instead just matches the market by for example copying the stocks in the S&P so that your return is roughly that of the S&P. And because you aren’t paying some slick manager to pick your stocks for you it’s a lot cheaper.
1705 2018-12-18 18:41:09 There is so much wrong here I don’t know where to start. Fishing quotas have brought fish stocks back from the brink. Many EU countries far more recycling than us and more energy from renewables. The 3rd biggest trading block can put pressure on China USA to reduce CO2 emissions
1706 2018-12-18 18:40:49 "You can take my bump stocks from my cold dead fingers."
1707 2018-12-18 18:40:29 This is the Trump administration moving the law and yet you still blame democrats. Trump has said so many times he wants to ban bump stocks.. take it up with your overlord.
1708 2018-12-18 18:40:15 Bump stocks are not some miracle device that turns a semi auto in to a machine gun.  They are difficult to use properly and take away any amount of accuracy.  All @potus did was turn law abiding citizens into felons for nothing.
1709 2018-12-18 18:40:14 $SPY Yes we're still hedged. It's quite a mixed bag on stocks here today. So staying reasonably cautious as far as the overall market.

1711 2018-12-18 18:40:09 Does anyone know whether or not binary triggers are included with this? I know I saw a bill that included them with bump stocks earlier this year.
1712 2018-12-18 18:40:03 I wish I understood stocks more
1713 2018-12-18 18:39:58 Banning bump stocks doesn't effect the weapon 
1714 2018-12-18 18:39:47 very rarely does he short stocks.
1715 2018-12-18 18:39:47 Santa said we gotta yank all those bump stocks off the line!
1716 2018-12-18 18:39:42 What would you possibly need bump stocks for? Honest question
1717 2018-12-18 18:39:32 Donald is a traitor. 

Why is everyone’s 401k shrinking, dopey? The answer: Dumb Donald destroys everything he touches. That’s why I pulled my 401k money out of stocks months ago.
1718 2018-12-18 18:39:25 By definition to focus on quality stocks at attractive market values, you must have raised cash already to be able to buy. So an element of market timing? No?
1719 2018-12-18 18:39:23 Oh and bump stocks are getting banned soon. Wait until the base gets a load of that. It'll hit the register soon enough. 

FTR: I don't give a rats butt about em.
1720 2018-12-18 18:39:14 #Trump Here is some food for thought: what impact might a Pence presidency have on financial markets?  On trade issues? On macroeconomic questions?  Will Trumpism continue, or will Pence serve merely as a caretaker president?
#stocks
1721 2018-12-18 18:39:06 It seems fishy because it is. There was near cross party support in Congress for banning bump stocks. Even the NRA said they backed it iirc. The infamous gun fetishists. With that much support in Congress, why the hell would anyone go about it like this? It's dodgy as hell.
1722 2018-12-18 18:38:54 No, investors want cash flow.  And that's exactly what they're telling executives.  That in combination with tax loss selling is why E&P stocks have been obliterated
1723 2018-12-18 18:38:51 What an earth are bump fire stocks ?
1724 2018-12-18 18:38:22 @realDonaldTrump if you are banning bump stocks because one bad man actions. You must compensate all back 500 tax credit each item turned in. Since zero compensation with making good people criminals upon what they legally own and bought is unconstitutional. Loss of many votes.
1725 2018-12-18 18:38:09 Trump's day so far: 

#Flynnsentencing - #generalflynn admits guilt, wasn't tricked #lockhimup
Bump stocks banned 
No #governmentshutdown for taxpayer-funding of the #borderwall
#TrumpFoundation SHUT DOWN for its "shocking pattern of illegality"
1726 2018-12-18 18:38:00 #US Stocks: Bank $BK -3.7%. Airline $AAL +4.5%. Realty Svc $CBRE +4.5%. F&B $DRI +5%. BioTech $BIIB -6.2%. Tech $NVDA +3.6%. Tobacco $PM -5.3%. Utility $PPL -5.3%.

1727 2018-12-18 18:37:58 That’s exactly what they do with stocks too.  They say sell when they’re really low and initiate buy ratings at the highs.
1728 2018-12-18 18:37:48 This ain't the first time we seen this happen I guess the oc got stocks or 9 lives in dallas
1729 2018-12-18 18:37:31 Too bad banning bump stocks won’t stop bump firing as the same can be accomplished with a belt loop
1730 2018-12-18 18:36:47 So Donald Trump is... banning bump stocks? ....

good start..
thanks?
... ? I'm confused.
1731 2018-12-18 18:36:43 @steveliesman the group just ddnt understand you this morn. U were spot on when it came to trump. how can he say one thing and expect the other result.  in his campaign he promissed higher interest rates with out thinking how it wud affect stocks and the economy.
1732 2018-12-18 18:36:41 Bump stocks may not be effective but banning then sets a precedent for future bans. Slippery slope.
1733 2018-12-18 18:36:41 Call Gundlach for a statement on Stocks? LOL
1734 2018-12-18 18:36:35 I don't own any guns, but I've been an avid bump-stock collector since 'dickity nine. Now CROOKED LIBERAL tRump is coming for my bump stocks!!! What about the 2nd!!!!!!
1735 2018-12-18 18:36:29 noice bump stocks are illegal
1736 2018-12-18 18:36:27 A lot of people said we couldn't lower the sock market by 5% to make stocks more affordable to investors.  Obama tried and he couldn't do it, but President Trump has and we have reason to believe that as stocks continue to drop there will be even more bargains to be had.
1737 2018-12-18 18:36:21 Vd confunde flujos con stocks, quienes pagan impuestos con quienes no, sencillamente no tiene ni idea. Confunde gasto público -pensiones y desempleo
1738 2018-12-18 18:36:12 IIRC, I think I read a quote from Dianne Feinstein who said something similar. Bump stocks should definitely be illegal, but yeah, it seems pretty fishy to me that the DOJ is pulling this. It is strange from an ideological perspective for them, as well.
1739 2018-12-18 18:35:59 I wonder what all those people who invested in bump stocks are going to do now? They expected a manufacturing ban and not a reclassification as machine gun.
1740 2018-12-18 18:35:52 why do i feel like the bump stocks ban is a distraction from the trump org lawsuits
1741 2018-12-18 18:35:50 Someone should ask her if she's shorted any particular stocks this week.
1742 2018-12-18 18:35:48 Bump stocks baby!!
1743 2018-12-18 18:35:40 The NRA publically called for bump stocks to be banned.
1744 2018-12-18 18:35:32 the law prohibits fully automatic rifles, bumps stocks are converting semi automatic rifles into fully automatic
1745 2018-12-18 18:35:08 Nobody cares about Bump stocks nor will banning them stop any mass shooting
1746 2018-12-18 18:35:08 After 8 years of people whining that Obama was going to take your guns - Trump bans bump stocks. Hope the world sees the comedy in this.
1747 2018-12-18 18:35:05 It's pleasant and Santa-centric to see retails names like $AMZN and $TGT having a good bounce day but more importantly, financial sector pillar-#stocks including $GS, $MET and dozens of others are bouncing. This allows some professional pundits to regain their composure. For now.
1748 2018-12-18 18:34:22 this whole no brexit deal thing is abit mad, 3,500 troops on standby and people are being told to pile up on their food stocks.. is this the apocalypse
1749 2018-12-18 18:34:10 I have no use for bump stocks. I have less use for people that cannot do basic research or want to ban things they simply do not understand
1750 2018-12-18 18:34:00 However you cut it, whether you think bump stocks should be illegal or not, the way they're going about making them illegal is terrifying. Because if it's allowed to stand it opens the door for the executive to turn around and say "No, no. This is what Congress really meant."
1751 2018-12-18 18:33:43 If you do 3 stocks in 3 minuets you have no skill
1752 2018-12-18 18:33:42 I feel like Powell will be undecided until 2pm Wednesday. He’s waiting to see if stocks can finish a day green before he announces smh
1753 2018-12-18 18:33:27 I’m astounded that this is an actual tweet. Hey, clue in. Bump stocks don’t turn a gun into an automatic! 
1754 2018-12-18 18:33:15 As a short, I want stocks that have literal cancer. $fb I has stage 12 aggressive melanoma of the asshole cavity.

Ask yourself: What is something good that can happen to FB this year? Answer: Their push into dating works, they become Tinder. 

Bad things? The list is long.
1755 2018-12-18 18:33:01 A step in the right direction on sensible gun control.  In spit of all the noise about "guns are not the problem, people are", today there is a chance that bump stocks will be outlawed.  I will wait for the final policy to come down and then I will celebrate for this good news.
1756 2018-12-18 18:32:37 Good. Bump stocks are pointless.
1757 2018-12-18 18:32:36 repeatedly smaller stocks inside each other
1758 2018-12-18 18:32:23 Why don’t they keep the stocks legal but outlaw the part on the other end.....
1759 2018-12-18 18:32:23 trigger being pulled. The DoJ, last I looked, seems to be taking the view that because you don't have to actively pull the trigger again, bump stocks are automatic. It's the executive redefining statute and then treating it as if that's what Congress always meant the law to be.
1760 2018-12-18 18:32:22 Oh no bump stocks are gonna be illegal. Boo fucking hoo.
1761 2018-12-18 18:32:20 Oh, bump stocks were banned also in case you missed it.
1762 2018-12-18 18:32:18 i feel like such an adult buying stocks, wow go me
1763 2018-12-18 18:32:17 ah man, I had to break away from snap and social media in general.  it’s too toxic.  used to be fun but I’ve lost my interest in it besides researching weed stocks 
1764 2018-12-18 18:32:17 Well bad luck I bought a ton of bump stocks to donate to the Trump Foundation. Oh well I’m sure I’ll cover my losses with my “12/18/2018 The Day the Flynn Sentence Came Down” shirts
1765 2018-12-18 18:32:16 That is my point with the grandfathering.  It is unconstitutional to deem someone a criminal for doing something that was not criminal when they did it. 
I still think bump stocks are stupid and degrade accuracy to the point that makes them pointless.
1766 2018-12-18 18:32:10 Bump stocks do not make a gun automatic, it only seems that way because it bounces back and forth quickly which makes it shoot faster. But the gun is still semi-automatic
1767 2018-12-18 18:31:57 Bump stocks have nothing to do with gun ownership?

Good.  When everyone is turning their bump stocks over to the ATF, you won't complain.
1768 2018-12-18 18:31:55 I’m not calling you a Racist I’m just saying you voted for one!!! You might want to get off Twitter today it’s been a bad day. Bump stocks banned, Organization shut down and Flynn singing! Can’t wait till he leaves so you can crawl back into the whole you came from!!

1770 2018-12-18 18:31:50 I am not an optimist. I am not a pessimist. I am a realist. I guess that is why I like TA so much. Charts may not predict the future but they do not lie about the past. They just are. The realist view ATM is that it is tiring watching stocks try to gain traction...
1771 2018-12-18 18:31:46 Too little too late Dadii. The uniforms are already in some warehouse & were waiting for the opportune time, after the deal to run stocks dry cooked proper.
1772 2018-12-18 18:30:48 Yes it still highly overvalued but thats nothing new with cannabis stocks.
1773 2018-12-18 18:30:40 I think ending prduction of bump stocks with regulations is legal. Right? But not confiscation of those on the market
1774 2018-12-18 18:30:39 bump stocks does not mean disarming
1775 2018-12-18 18:30:37 Sexy but doesn’t work long term:

1778 2018-12-18 18:29:31 #2AShallNotBeInfringed #2A lovers - look what Trump admin just did: Justice Dept issued final rule today - bans bump stocks, DOJ official tells Fox there are 10s of thousands in US. "People who posses them will be required to destroy them or turn them in to ATF [within] 90 days.”

1780 2018-12-18 18:28:48 Class 3 license is required, which any law abiding citizen with a clean record can obtain (i.e. me) so no, they're not illegal. I have no issues with banning bump stocks. Semi-auto rifles arent built to run like a full-auto and will melt down. Theyre also incredibly inaccurate.
1781 2018-12-18 18:28:43 Trump bans bump stocks so the Democratic party will likely endorse the use of bump stocks, any day now. Just waiting!

1786 2018-12-18 18:28:18 Our snowmobile should not use fuels containing ethanol, according to Ski-doo. So most snowmachiners buy premium and @AlpineCreekLdg only stocks premium. (It's very expensive to get large fuel storage tanks set up and filled when you are 64 miles off maintained road).
1787 2018-12-18 18:28:04 I wasn't far off, enough to see a 25% gain followed by death, never listen to a friend who says tether is a scam, media FUD to make you loose and not knowing btc pulls the alts down, two basic things can save you and learnt in the first month. Glad I didn't invest in stocks 
1788 2018-12-18 18:27:53 the DoJ did was take the term "action" and redefine it. Even with bump stocks, you still technical pull the trigger each time, it's just the sliding stock presses the trigger against your finger so you don't have to move it, but as far as Congress was concerned, still a (2/3)
1789 2018-12-18 18:27:44 If I recall correctly, Value Line used to take the consensus forecasts for individual stocks and then add or subtract the standard deviation of return that analysts were right/wrong by in the past to generate their forecasts. 

Not sure how GMO does it.
1790 2018-12-18 18:27:40 Trump announced to ban bump stocks and the #NRA cucks are mighty silent. As silent as they were during the 3D printed weapons rulings. It's almost like they don't give a shit about anyone but the manufacturers.

1803 2018-12-18 18:25:41 You need to speak up about bump stocks NOW, or else how am I supposed to take the NRA seriously? 

Really, NRA members are COMPLETE pushovers. Losers!
1804 2018-12-18 18:25:05 Lmfao you need reading comprehension.  I said I called the top at .024 but yes it hit .027. If you can call stocks give or take a few ticks like me then you would make millions too but you cant lmfao. 
1805 2018-12-18 18:25:02 Then the government will yell emergency emergency… Because the banks will be failing… And he will permit them to do a Bail-in… Which means convert your RRSP’s and savings to worthless bank stocks… Taking your money… Well you can see the rest!
1806 2018-12-18 18:25:02 Wait until the stocks tank...it’s coming
1807 2018-12-18 18:24:59 President Trump,
Gun owners are not happy with you banning bump stocks. I don’t own one, nor an AR15 but fear this might be just the beginning. We are a major part of the population that is responsible for you winning the election. Reconsider, please!
1808 2018-12-18 18:24:47 You're not disappearing like Saturn's rings thanks to Trump banning bump stocks.
1809 2018-12-18 18:24:35 Obama didn’t even ban bump stocks? OOF
1810 2018-12-18 18:24:35 Have any of those stocks, joe?   Mmmm
1811 2018-12-18 18:23:56 XRP is NOT a stock

1812 2018-12-18 18:23:46 Bump stocks are not a guaranteed right.  And if you miss them that much, make one. Skilled shooters don’t need them anyway.
1813 2018-12-18 18:23:45 Do people use bump stocks for self defense?
1814 2018-12-18 18:23:02 de stocks et 10 .000 personnes qui doivent attendre la prochaine livraison . Aujourd'hui c'est quand même un peu differents , vu que les ventes digitales et streaming sont prisent en compte . Mais pour le format physique c'est ça
1815 2018-12-18 18:22:58 stocks are just gambling but the boring gambling where you do get to see the horses go fast
1816 2018-12-18 18:22:41 Well here's one thing Gundlach is wrong about. The move in $crypto is nothing like the move in tech stocks prior to '00 or the housing bubble prior to '08. He claims we have all the pre-conditions for a bear market. We did not, and do not. ERP, Yield Curve, and A/D line. $SPX
1817 2018-12-18 18:22:37 Banning bump stocks, I would like to say the gesture will be felt but feel the only reason behind it is that maybe the sales are down
1818 2018-12-18 18:22:19 Making things illegal can stop the production, no peoduction less violence eith regards to bump stocks
1819 2018-12-18 18:22:09 I'm learning to try and stop searching for bottoms, a lot more success with trending stocks lately.
1820 2018-12-18 18:21:54 You should inform President Trump gun owners are not happy with him banning bump stocks. I don’t own one, nor an AR15 but fear this might be just the beginning. We are a major part of the population that is responsible for him winning the election. Ask him to reconsider, please!
1821 2018-12-18 18:21:44 A ban on bump stocks, while it may seem to be a good idea won’t achieve anything. Guns can still be bumped without that accessory and a ban is more than likely unconstitutional.
1822 2018-12-18 18:21:35 Under a new federal rule, those who possess the devices, commonly known as bump stocks, will get 90 days to turn them in from the date that the final rule is published in the federal register, which is likely Friday, officials said
1823 2018-12-18 18:21:20 I will commend the US government for the ban of bump stocks. That is a good thing y'all have done.
1824 2018-12-18 18:21:15 You don’t use bump stocks with a handgun. It’s important to understand the basics.
1825 2018-12-18 18:21:04 - Trump blinks over shutdown.
- Trump Foundation slush fund gone but still under investigation.
- Flynn entrapment talking point burned to cinders.
- Trump sells out his gun nut base and bans bump stocks.

Pretty good morning, folks.
1826 2018-12-18 18:20:56 Get Rid of Bump Stocks 
1827 2018-12-18 18:20:55 Analyst upgrades left and right.  Trying to prop their stocks so the charts  can survive the market turmoil.  Hope they all get coal in their stockings.  Misleading headlines everywhere.
1828 2018-12-18 18:20:42 Finally, some good news on bump stocks!
1829 2018-12-18 18:20:28 Companies are buying back stocks and yet their stock prices are falling.  The tax cut is a complete failure.
1830 2018-12-18 18:20:18 Wall Street has been too busy listening to the new Van Morrison album to buy stocks, probably
1831 2018-12-18 18:19:49 total capitulation in oil - 40s then 30s - avoiding all oil stocks - peeps still think we are in 80 buck territory - we're not!!
1832 2018-12-18 18:19:48 #Stocks can't soar faster than wages can sustainably because people can't spend their health insurance card investing in stocks.
What's hard to understand?
1833 2018-12-18 18:19:44 The BATF JUST RULED BUMP STOCKS AS MACHINE GUNS. NEXT RUBBER BANDS WILL BE BANED !
1834 2018-12-18 18:19:24 Society should come together to dolve the problems,bump stocks can make no good but harm
1835 2018-12-18 18:19:19 Trump Administration is banning bump stocks I say good because I can't hit shit with it on any way lol it's just fun at times but if I'm really trying to hit the target I'd rather not have the bump stock on my AK. #MAGA #BumpStocks #dontbothermeonebit
1836 2018-12-18 18:19:15 You may be right. I just look at the numbers and the chart. I'm not in the business of making moral judgement... I'm in the business of finding stocks that perform. I hope these "scumbags" know how to run a company. 
1837 2018-12-18 18:19:12 So Trump is trying to redirect today's conversation 
from 
Flynn, treason and self-dealing Trump Foundation 
to
banning bump stocks and Space Command.
1838 2018-12-18 18:19:04 Trump thinks banning bump stocks is gun control. I guarantee you, he checked with the NRA prior to doing it!
1839 2018-12-18 18:19:01 Everyone except rural Trump supporters. Do they even know about stocks? They actually live on Mars!
1840 2018-12-18 18:18:59 They need to be able to do 1/10's instead of 1/4 being the smallest granularity. This impact on the market is ridiculous. Not that long ago, we used to trade stocks in 1/8's and 1/16's, then common sense prevailed and we can now do pennies. Time to do that with the Fed rate.
1841 2018-12-18 18:18:53 Maybe Trump supporers want us to be like Putin’s Russia. Individuals can’t get bump stocks there. Or AR-15s to use then on. Or any guns at all.
1842 2018-12-18 18:18:36 $SPX #stocks $FDX and $MU set to report #earnings Tuesday after market close; other names reporting after the bell include #midcap #stock $JBL and #smallcap #stocks $ABM $AIR and $SCS #trading
1843 2018-12-18 18:18:35 Honestly,  it truly pains me to say this, but I really believe it must be said.

Let's give @realDonaldTrump a shout out for doing the right thing, & banning Bump Stocks. It's not a solve all but at least it's a start that has been long needed. Thank you for doing this President
1844 2018-12-18 18:18:33 Aphria $APHA going parabolic the last 30 mins, up over 12%

1845 2018-12-18 18:18:32 I think @GioiasDeli often stocks it.
1846 2018-12-18 18:18:28 @Sqwii i had to take a break from stocks, two weeks ago - so i haven’t looked at them before today, and they all seem to have dropped.. whats happening on the stock market and what do you think will happen near term? I have:

1847 2018-12-18 18:18:25 Having to Xmas food shopping with papa L just too make sure he stocks up on pink gin 
1848 2018-12-18 18:18:12 While a agree bump stocks are a stretch you can gtfo with the rest of your statement. 

Criminals and the government have high cap mags and for that reason so do i.
1849 2018-12-18 18:18:10 Returned from errands to FOUR bits of amazing news: Flynn beatdown in open court, bump stocks banned, Trump Foundation shuttering under court supervision, and Trump caving on wall demands to avoid shutdown. (And the sun making a rare appearance in W. Mich!) And it's only Tuesday!
1850 2018-12-18 18:18:05 What we learned today. The Fed should 'feel the market' according to President. Former Fed Chair, Greenspan, says investors should 'run for cover' after rebound in stocks. The simulation is getting tired. Needs new writers.
1851 2018-12-18 18:17:56 Yeah, we both won a game and then called it quits.  It was essentially just us hitting each other for stocks at a time lol!
1852 2018-12-18 18:17:46 Full Auto weapons aren't illegal though. Bump stocks work the same way as a finger through the trigger guard and around your belt loop. So good job on doing....nothing basically.
1853 2018-12-18 18:17:45 bye bye bump stocks. 
1854 2018-12-18 18:17:44 Really been looking forward to see the context of the illustrations you have teased us with recently, and it looks really promising ^^

Hopefully stocks will last..
1855 2018-12-18 18:17:40 I guess what I’m saying is, restricting bump stocks for guns is so commonsensical even @realDonaldTrump gets it.
1856 2018-12-18 18:17:33 So true. Bump stocks ruin your rifle anyway
1857 2018-12-18 18:17:31 When actual self-admitted, white power nazis think bump stocks should remain legal- well, enough said.
1858 2018-12-18 18:17:00 Like I get why we did 2 stocks in Smash 4 since the game was slower and favored more defensive players but whenever I get matched up with people in quick play that only have two stocks, I just die a little inside.
1859 2018-12-18 18:16:50 Bump stocks completely banned? Wonder how the gun “enthusiasts” are gonna act?
1860 2018-12-18 18:16:34 Only if stocks go up in response otherwise he will probly be quiet and just do one tweet blaming it on Democrats, which I actually kinda think it is, all the volatility started as mid term elections heated up and post election is when technical indicators really lit up bearish.
1861 2018-12-18 18:16:31 Bump stocks are just simple plastic molds, how does this stop a motivated mass killer? A belt can give you the exact same result. Meaningless legislation.
1862 2018-12-18 18:16:20 Political Tuesday: I am amazed to say it, being a bleeding heart liberal snowflake, but I saw news from the current administration today I approved of. The Trump Administration had banned bump stocks. I support this as I only see the item as a means around automatic weapon ban.
1863 2018-12-18 18:16:19 And making bump stocks illegal. A major issue with the NRAers.
1864 2018-12-18 18:16:07 
1865 2018-12-18 18:15:44 Yes, that the announcement is timed is no surprise. The ban of Bump Stocks is a good thing and long (decades) overdue. There are about 6 other legislative actions that can reduce gun violence without compromising 2nd amendment; the only impediment is weak "slippery slope" arg.
1866 2018-12-18 18:15:43 Bump stocks are a simple plastic mold. I’m sure motivated mass killers will really have a rough time making their own  Besides, the same result can be done with a belt
1867 2018-12-18 18:15:40 They also didn’t have school shootings killing children using bump-stocks that are easily accessible. Most would have to reload. Use your logic
1868 2018-12-18 18:15:29 Not only does the bump stocks need to be banned and the background checks to be more thorough but we also need more law enforcement and we need more security in our schools...! More police stations and we need metal detectors at our schools! What are we waiting for?
1869 2018-12-18 18:15:20 - Trump caves on border wall funding.
- Trump dissolves scam "charity" foundation
- Trump caves to gun control activists on bump stocks
- Judge set to imprison Flynn for treason

It's a TERRIBLE day to be a cultist.

And it's only 1:15pm.
1870 2018-12-18 18:15:09 These people think making bump stocks illegal is gonna do something.... you can make one with a 3D printer...
1871 2018-12-18 18:15:02 I think I’ll stop for the day. We just got some really good news. Bump stocks are now prohibited. Thank you Mr. Trump this one is appreciated. #Parkland #BumpStocks
1872 2018-12-18 18:14:57 Trump bans Bump Stocks: I'm not impressed. IF he's so worried about I'll intent of an altered mind shooting the place up why didn't he enact a Fed Backround Check. That would stop a hell of alot more ill folks at the gate. No! let them in, holler, you, with the gun, you insane?
1873 2018-12-18 18:14:56 Interesting how a ban on bump stocks elicits an NRA non-response which creates a false equivalency with a non-existent AR ban and all the gun toting tiny dicked sheep who are too afraid to use a good old fashioned bolt, lever action, or single shot, like a real man, start crying.
1874 2018-12-18 18:14:52 Trump banning bump stocks are going to hinder his bid for 2020.  He his hitting his 2nd amendment voters in the eye.  They will remember this.
1875 2018-12-18 18:14:40 LMAO...There are thousands of bumps stocks in circulation and more than half will never be turned in... Just lip service to the lib tards
1876 2018-12-18 18:14:26 With the ban on bump stocks underway, expect Kent state gun girl to pose completely naked with an AR up her butt
1877 2018-12-18 18:14:20 The @coinbase news is a bigger deal for Wall Street than it is for #crypto. So much money is wasted on trading fees when you sell $AAPL to buy $NFLX, or sell CHTR bonds to buy CZR bonds. All stocks/bonds will be digitized soon - direct trading pairs for stocks/bonds will follow.
1878 2018-12-18 18:14:11 If people can't compromise and support restrictions restrictions on high-capacity magazines and bump stocks then realistic gun safety regulation may be impossible.
1879 2018-12-18 18:14:08 It's time for me to give an honest Thank you to @realDonaldTrump . Today you did the right thing by banning Bump Stocks. It's not a solve all but at least a start. A start that has been seriously needed. Maybe you can go farther and add mental illness to the ban. Thank you again.
1880 2018-12-18 18:13:52 Trump admin banned bump stocks. Won’t make CNN news but was a bipartisan and common sense move. Well done.
1881 2018-12-18 18:13:44 Removing bump-stocks in no way infringes on the 2nd Amendment.
1882 2018-12-18 18:13:33 Trump administration bans bump stocks

No other administration has done more than the current @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Thank you!
1883 2018-12-18 18:13:30 Again; what is the purpose and need for bump stocks? How many human lives justify better laws?
1884 2018-12-18 18:13:03 What app you use for trading or buying stocks my boy?
1885 2018-12-18 18:12:53 How much money will I lose if the stocks go down?  I’m not a Financial Planner but I’m thinking I only lose if I sell lower than I bought, so why sell if the history shows things that go up go down but go up again?
1886 2018-12-18 18:12:46 Trump administration bans bump stocks
1887 2018-12-18 18:12:36 Trump administration bans bump stocks

No other administration has done more after a school shooting. Thank you @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump
1888 2018-12-18 18:12:27 They just should hold on the stocks for long term , can't see them losing.
1889 2018-12-18 18:12:13 I despise Trump and think he's a total fraud.

But bump stocks were officially banned today and I'm thankful for that.
We have much, much further to go on our gun laws, but I was happy to see this.
1890 2018-12-18 18:12:08 Hillary would have never allowed a ban on bump stocks! Trump hoodwinked all of you and now taking away your guns!
1891 2018-12-18 18:11:56 So they are banning bump stocks.... The nutters are gonna flip...
1892 2018-12-18 18:11:56 Something tells me they were waiting for manufacturers to create ‘pump stocks’ which are *totally* different, you see, because they DO the same thing but it starts with a P
1893 2018-12-18 18:11:48 Like Chicago. Like California. How many “mass shootings” were committed in gun-free zones? How many of these mass shooters were on prescription drugs? Why don’t you answer these questions first? Bump stocks, please! The problem is a heart issue. Bad people are gonna do bad things
1894 2018-12-18 18:11:44 remember this is Xmas week so many people took off on vacation. volume will be significantly lower. So stocks are easier to be manipulated, less liquidity... means even greater discipline and focus required.  good luck
1895 2018-12-18 18:11:06 Considering how they Define bump stocks nothing is going to be illegal to own now so this really new problem here and no reason to blame anybody
1896 2018-12-18 18:11:03 for the record bump stocks are ridiculous and serve no practical function, and a ban was wayyy overdue. im just concerned about the means by which theyre implementing the ban because that could muddy the waters on what is and isnt legally considered a machine gun
1897 2018-12-18 18:10:58 Trump administration bans bump stocks!!
1898 2018-12-18 18:10:58 Stocks are up around 1% Tuesday after they plunged almost 4% over the previous two days. Industrials, tech and sellers of consumer non-essentials are climbing. US crude oil is down another 5% on concerns supplies continue to climb.
1899 2018-12-18 18:10:27 I’m just waiting for @federalreserve it’s two-day policy meeting today. Meanwhile, U.S stocks bounced higher and rising anxieties about the health of global growth 
1900 2018-12-18 18:10:26 I would suggest reading the linked article (& links within said article). If NR is willing to come out against this, even though they recommend banning bump stocks thru legislation, then it’s because the way it’s being done is clearly illegal & will be struck down by the courts
1901 2018-12-18 18:10:20 4 year degree- 20 years. Stocks, bonds, forex, investments- a few months. You choose
1902 2018-12-18 18:10:07 You should be happy now Shitty @CNN, bump stocks are banned so what now? Are you going to bitch about not having shit to bitch about? 
#CluelessNewsNetwork
1903 2018-12-18 18:10:01 Hi! Do you have any advice on what we can do before the recession? We, Democrats did not vote for that orange Cheeto yet we will still be affected. I’m really scared. Is it still wise to buy stocks or hold off? Is it smart to put my house on the market or hold off?
1904 2018-12-18 18:09:39 I’m just waiting for @federalreserve it’s two-day policy meeting today. Meanwhile, U.S stocks bounced higher and rising anxieties about the health of global growth 
1905 2018-12-18 18:09:24 So since people are saying they refuse to turn in the dumb bump stocks, does this mean we also get to disobey other laws now too?????? Like for fucks sake 
1906 2018-12-18 18:09:19 Shhh stop telling all my secrets ! I have a lot of money invested in the ladder stocks
1907 2018-12-18 18:08:49 I’m just waiting for @federalreserve it’s two-day policy meeting today. Meanwhile, U.S stocks bounced higher and rising anxieties about the health of global growth 
1908 2018-12-18 18:08:45 You should have thought about that prior to putting them in that position. You have NO credibility. Good job on the bump stocks. You deserve kudos for that.
1909 2018-12-18 18:08:41 I'm certainly not against banning bump stocks, but we also need to look at binary triggers.
1910 2018-12-18 18:08:11 For the record the Obama administration made bump stocks legal. Another BO mistake that Trump has to fix.
1911 2018-12-18 18:08:06 No one needs bump stocks !
1912 2018-12-18 18:07:51 You have a choice with stocks but not in countries. Employees can’t choose their CEOs

Also, how are you with the DoJ ruling on Bump Stocks coming out today?
1916 2018-12-18 18:06:38 Can't wait to see all the outrage from the ammosexuals now that bump stocks are federally illegal.

1920 2018-12-18 18:06:07 Bump stocks?
1921 2018-12-18 18:05:48 bump stocks

Pls you guys should step up your Ideas
1923 2018-12-18 18:05:42 I blasted him ....hahaha.......something along the lines "stay in your own sandbox, which is stocks, .you suck at crypto and you going to get ppl hurt AF"  ....he blocked me. Mission was accomplished.
1924 2018-12-18 18:05:30 Mr President @realDonaldTrump right now is not the time (or any for that matter) to turn supporters away. You banned bump stocks & you think all your supporters won't be pissed? What happened to being a #2Arights supporter? #2AShallNotBeInfringed @NRA are you gonna do anything!!
1925 2018-12-18 18:05:12 Okay folks, I'm starting to dabble in investing. Got a couple stocks now, and looking for your fave people/orgs here to follow for investing news.

1930 2018-12-18 18:04:21 Good to hear, you're probably right and hopefully we'll just be donating the stocks or using them up slowly in the end. Just worried how many people haven't saved anything, and some even telling others not to.
1931 2018-12-18 18:04:12 How? How will banning bump stocks do anything?
1932 2018-12-18 18:03:50 I’m adding $East.v .16 cents. Added $Btr.v $2.87-2.88 also. This is tax loss selling and nothing fundamental. Both stocks should bounce back in a big way going into early 2019

1936 2018-12-18 18:02:59 You forget, deliberately, after tariffs were implemented, stocks shot up to record highs still.  The pull back is the result of an expectation of slower growth.  Not because of tariffs.

1940 2018-12-18 18:02:22 Anyone else notice the double top in the #dowjones with a break below support at 24,500? US Equity market look vulnerable to a BIG retraction... #stocks #stockmarket
1941 2018-12-18 18:02:04 Prior to Vegas, stocks like the slidefires were never used in any "mass murders" which the term is just multiple homicides.  The problem is that it's impossible to regulate bump firing as your finger is literally a bump fire device.
1942 2018-12-18 18:02:03 Today would be a perfect day to unload on stocks. Let others holding the bag. $ES_F
1943 2018-12-18 18:01:36 That said, the hope for stocks is now the only one that matters...the Fed. Watch #Powell raise rates tomorrow BUT officially proclaim they are now ON HOLD with no further rate hikes in 2019 pending further data. I expect hated stock market to rally 3-5% by Friday's close. #MTP
1944 2018-12-18 18:01:34 Idiots. RT @kaijubushi: “We have no idea why a guy killed 60 people in Vegas, but we’re pretty sure if we ban bump stocks it’ll never happen again.”
1945 2018-12-18 18:01:27 Trump took a step in the right direction today as bump stocks will now be illegal. He’s not perfect, but he’s starting to realize what needs to be done.

1947 2018-12-18 18:01:22 Don't you buy stocks at the support? Or do you wait until buy signals are confirmed?
1948 2018-12-18 18:01:06 The country has 330 million people.  Of course they will.  But we can make it less.  We’re at something like a 60 year low homicide rate, but we can still go lower.  But we’re more interested in dicking around with “common sense”, assault weapons bans, bump stocks, and so on.
1949 2018-12-18 18:00:58 this has nothing to do with bump stocks

1955 2018-12-18 17:59:23 But have you bot stocks?
1956 2018-12-18 17:58:43 Disagree 100%. Trump's tax cuts for corporations, cut business regulations & massive corp repatriation of overseas cash (record stock buybacks) was a huge short term 'sugar high' for US stocks. Short term boost is over, as is Trump's 'honeymoon'. Smart $$ now realize he's toxic.
1957 2018-12-18 17:58:41 Hell of a day for #maga chuds:
1. Flynn affirms his guilty plea. 2. Trump Foundation dissolved amid growing evidence of illegal self-dealing; Trump and children barred from serving on the board of any NY charity. 3. Bump stocks banned. 4. LOLOLOLOLOLOL
1958 2018-12-18 17:58:05 I don't own bump-stocks because they're stupid, but I wish I did so that I could non-comply.
1959 2018-12-18 17:57:55 FWIW, the entire effort to ban bump stocks is legislative virtue-signaling. Vegas was, to my knowledge, the only instance of one ever being used in a crime. They can easily be 3D printed. They’re unpopular, uncomfortable, and generally just a gimmick. Not exactly a boogieman.
1960 2018-12-18 17:57:54 Trump bans bump stocks and militarizes space in the same day. His core supporters (Russians and NRA members) are going to be very cross with him.
1961 2018-12-18 17:57:44 Bump stocks have finally been banned.  #onesmallstep
1962 2018-12-18 17:57:41 @realDonaldTrump  congrats on banning bump stocks!  It's nice to see a positive thing in between all the chaos you have created.... sincerely though, good job on that one. 
1963 2018-12-18 17:57:32 Why worried about stocks we have @realDonaldTrump pumping the market, just buy the dip enjoy the ride $SPY
1964 2018-12-18 17:57:19 Isn’t it ironic that it is Trump who is taking away bump stocks from gun owners and not Obama or Hillary 
1965 2018-12-18 17:57:11 Saving as in cash, stocks, bonds or does it factor in home equity?

1967 2018-12-18 17:56:49 You agree with bump stocks? I don’t personally car but they give capability for these shootings

1971 2018-12-18 17:56:13 Never mind this is infringement, Ex post facto laws are also unconstitutional. 

I’m deeply disturbed by @POTUS decision. NE1 who knows anything about bump stocks knows

-You can duplicate same effect with a belt loop

-They making accuracy absolutely atrocious

- not full auto
1972 2018-12-18 17:56:07 Bump stocks should be illegal!!! That's actually really good
1973 2018-12-18 17:55:55 Incremental purchasing. Dollar cost averaging is painful as a means of defense, yet useful as a way to build a position. Personally, I buy stocks on down days and sell stocks on up days. Tomorrow will be a different kind of day though.
1974 2018-12-18 17:55:43 I hate Trump with the heat of a thousand suns. I am still pleased he banned bump stocks.
1975 2018-12-18 17:55:42 Trump's day so far: 

#Flynnsentencing - #generalflynn admits guilt, wasn't tricked #lockhimup
Bump stocks banned 
No #governmentshutdown for taxpayer-funding of the #borderwall
#TrumpFoundation SHUT DOWN for its "shocking pattern of illegality"

#maga #kag #qanon
1976 2018-12-18 17:55:38 I don't think that's what is being proposed. My understanding is they would ban the future manufacture and sale of bump stocks, but I do not believe that legally purchased items would be taken away from people.
1977 2018-12-18 17:55:17 mais je sais plus où les mettre mes mugs, je suis à deux doigts d'embaucher quelqu'un pour gérer mes stocks, ça me va tout autant si je gagne pas ahaha
1978 2018-12-18 17:55:14 Nice Music... Are you celebrating the banning of the Bump Stocks by your 2nd amendment president?
1979 2018-12-18 17:55:01 I’ll have a post re: @POTUS banning bump stocks up within an hour on @FreedomFirstB. #2A #MAGA #tcot #tlot
1980 2018-12-18 17:54:16 FDM would never work, he said you couldn’t clean the support material out of most models. RE Bump stocks: He said the bump stocks the companies could make professionally would cost a fortune. (Note: he says he doesn’t know any that would make or sell them at all)
1981 2018-12-18 17:54:02 You do realize how long bump stocks have been out right?
1982 2018-12-18 17:53:39 The conspiracy theorist in me thinks the Trump Admin. only banned bump stocks in a hail Mary effort to give his approval rating a positive bump for the first time in a long long while.. how many private citizens ever even heard about bump stocks before Vegas?

..Thoughts?
1983 2018-12-18 17:53:33 Trump bans bump stocks 
1984 2018-12-18 17:53:22 FAANG stocks doing all the heavy lifting so far.
1985 2018-12-18 17:53:07 Bump stocks are being banned, the trump foundation is being dissolved and Michael Flynn is going to be sentenced wow what a beautiful Tuesday 
1986 2018-12-18 17:53:00 looks like Algorithms programmed to buy stocks hard into the close.
1987 2018-12-18 17:52:32 A professor told me don’t get into stocks/trading. I should go back n show him my account now lol
1988 2018-12-18 17:52:23 Well, bump stocks are not always used by the person who bought them.
1989 2018-12-18 17:52:19 #Trump  bans bump stocks.
Wall funding off table.

Reward your enemies, screw your friends.
1990 2018-12-18 17:52:18 Thank you @realDonaldTrump for ending Obama's ruling to approve bump stocks. Finally a president with a brain.
1991 2018-12-18 17:52:17 The tide seems to have shifted somewhat today

1.  Trump Foundation
2.  Flynn sentencing
3. Bump stocks
4. Wall

1992 2018-12-18 17:52:08 Stocks hold onto gains at midday
1993 2018-12-18 17:52:07 I can't decide if the Trump Administration banning bump stocks is genuine, or an attempt to distract from #MichaelFlynn and the #TrumpFoundation
1994 2018-12-18 17:52:02 Really? The army is briefed to be deployed, the NHS unsure about drug supply, our hauliers won’t be able  operate as before, our car manufacturing will go,  food stocks being built. We are heading off a cliff edge and you’re moaning about a few euros.
1995 2018-12-18 17:51:58 Why couldn’t they just ban bump stocks?? Why did the need to be redefined?
1996 2018-12-18 17:51:50 Years ago I was pregnant, working for a stocks & shares firm with only 4 women in it. I was monitoring my manager's emails. I had emailed the HR person about the status of my maternity package. She emailed my manager in a flap saying "What should I say????!!!!!". I saw it. Awks.
1997 2018-12-18 17:51:34 It’s not that I can’t play other stages, but I know for a fact there is more than one person that wants to play 3 stocks FD and it’s just a game of chance
1998 2018-12-18 17:51:32 I agree the markets are crazy right now and the fed reserve isn’t helping with QE anymore and raising rates. Of course this leads to buying options to get stocks cheap if you can sit on them for the market to recover. Overall employment is great and wages are rising.
1999 2018-12-18 17:51:31 Further proof that Trump is a big govt commie. Bump stocks do not work, and they weren't used in any shooting despite what they try to tell you. Anyone with a brain can listen and tell you by sound that the rate of fire in the recordings was actual automatics.

2012 2018-12-18 17:49:14 Would bump stocks exist if there was no full auto ban?
Its a circumvention of the law,
Gun owners are not going to die on this hill.
2013 2018-12-18 17:49:04 Gosh.
Only took GOP a year to figure out bump stocks are evil.
@GOP
2014 2018-12-18 17:48:56 Yeah I think it was to do with etfs just grouping stocks together + arbitrage between individual stocks and etfs during sell offs
2015 2018-12-18 17:48:33 @realDonaldTrump "Trump administration moves to ban bump stocks" "Wall funding off table".  Who do you think elected you?
2016 2018-12-18 17:48:14 Ummm...that's is technically and literally incorrect. I care less that they want to outlaw bump stocks, and more that they are stating a pure untruth in the law in order to do it. Bump stock does not change one bullet fired per pull of the trigger. <more>
2017 2018-12-18 17:48:14 I think you might’ve mistaken my meaning. I feel that it’s likely the NRA will condemn the banning of bump stocks...while remaining silent on the much more critical issue of mass shootings.
2018 2018-12-18 17:47:41 Sorry Mr. ATF, I was taking all my bump stocks on a boating trip when they fell overboard.
2019 2018-12-18 17:47:12 ATF leadership is Federally appointed.

That Trump *also* wants to ban bump stocks is immaterial.

ATF/DOJ cannot change US Code.
2020 2018-12-18 17:47:02 Stocks going to have to tantrum a little harder if they don't want that hike tomorrow.
2021 2018-12-18 17:46:33 uh oh all bump stocks have to be destroyed by March 
2022 2018-12-18 17:46:28 This is clearly trumps first step in becoming a dictator. Not to mention trump is a racist by banning bump stocks.
2023 2018-12-18 17:46:25 Either the VIX gets cheap, or Stocks get cheap... What happens first?
2024 2018-12-18 17:46:15 Selling high end lots now to eat the losses and lower my average on 3 stocks. Between trump crap, tariffs, brexit, slower global growth, its a volatile nightmare in the markets.
Sorry Romy, just venting a bit.

2026 2018-12-18 17:46:00 My SIL was asking about opening an acct. I said maybe index funds - I have a high tolerance for losing money lol + I enjoy buying/following studying stocks so I buy them - I told him if a stock going down 3-5 pts makes you sell go index 1/
2027 2018-12-18 17:45:52 Yea bump stocks can go. Along with anything that increases fire power. And 50+ magazines are already illegal which helps. My shotguns and concealed carry on the other hand I’ll fight for lol
2028 2018-12-18 17:45:25 “Many are off duty police officers”
Okay, so then I REALLY don’t want them having bump stocks lol
2029 2018-12-18 17:45:22 @salihirmu doesn’t make sense though it follows other weed stocks down but not up
2030 2018-12-18 17:45:21 You can have the same success by using your belt loop!! But what I’m saying is these anti gun obama lovers don’t know he made bump stocks available not once but twice!!
2031 2018-12-18 17:45:14 IIRC, it's always been the @NRA's position that BATFE needs to review its Obama-era ruling on bump stocks. If you don't like the way things turned out, elect a Congress that will change the law. If you sat on your hands last month, then don't bitch about the Congress you got.

2033 2018-12-18 17:45:05 A smart congress would do bump stocks while removing silencers from schedule 1, note it's a compromise.
We don't have a smart Congess
2034 2018-12-18 17:45:03 And that is the reason that #Individual1 is promoting a #shoutdown ? Look at the stocks and the level of trust, I meant zero trust in this individual

2036 2018-12-18 17:45:00 the is the best day ever, the hits just keep coming

Flynn, Trump's charity, bump stocks.... it's all too much their heads must be exploding
2037 2018-12-18 17:44:52 Except for the fact that he said they would ban bump stocks months ago. To wait for a time to use it as a political  shiny object put folks in danger. If someone had used a bump stock in the mean time to slaughter folks, Trump would have blamed the delay on democrats.
2038 2018-12-18 17:44:26 The sales weren't illegal, and bump stocks haven't been illegal so nothing was tracked. Future sales will be (maybe) but that does nothing about the units already out there.
2039 2018-12-18 17:44:25 Except for those who own bump stocks now.... way to go NRA, ya dropped the ball... hell,ya passed it to anti gunners actually nvm, And you backed the support for it. Who are you again?
2040 2018-12-18 17:44:19 Should bump stocks be banned by federal law?
A) Yes
B) No, each state can set the law
C) No, they should be legal
#BumpStocks #GunControl #gunsense #Guns #JusticeDept @NPR @1a @NRA
2041 2018-12-18 17:44:01 Bloomberg: “U.S. bans bump stocks and gives owners 90 days to give them up.” In 8 years under REAL President Obama, not a single gun or accessories were taken away from a single American citizen. Did you clear this through the NRA?
2042 2018-12-18 17:44:01 Options trading is higher risk with a higher reward. Common stocks are less risky if you do the proper research on the companies you plan to invest with. Be careful investing now because we are in a bear market. Also square seems overvalued here
2043 2018-12-18 17:43:57 @JasonButtrill Can you discuss the recent story from the AP regarding the Administration moving to ban bump-stocks and making them illegal to own by late March?
2044 2018-12-18 17:43:48 Well, see... I've learned from the NRA. First they come for your bump stocks then they come for your guns.
2045 2018-12-18 17:43:43 apple stocks rise by 35%.
2046 2018-12-18 17:43:42 @realDonaldTrump Hey man, way to go on the bump stocks. It's a step in the right direction. #waytogobud
2047 2018-12-18 17:43:33 I don't think anyone who plays the markets is stupid enough to believe anything you say about stocks.  You've wiped out 2018 gains thanks to your trade war, you said you had a deal with China when you didn't and your NAFTA agreement is almost exactly the same as the old one.
2048 2018-12-18 17:43:30 I don't support bump stocks, but you're right. If there's no compensation for turning them in I'd consider  it an infringement of rights.
2049 2018-12-18 17:43:05 analysts cannot really predict the way stocks react to changing oil prices.
2050 2018-12-18 17:43:03 If you give them your bump stocks then they will have all of the bump stocks. This is the exact same thing that happened in Nazi Germany when Hitler made everyone turn in their guns. And we know #LasVegasShooting was a False Flag incident too.
2051 2018-12-18 17:42:57 @realDonaldTrump You’re losing my support a little each day. You allow the communists to continue to dictate the agenda. Our “justice” agencies are compromised and you are worried about bump-stocks. Just quit now and let the US burn down.
2052 2018-12-18 17:42:44 Oh, it's not a ban on bump stocks, supported by the NRA? Please enlighten me, because now I'm very confused.

2065 2018-12-18 17:40:10 The Trump administration is moving to officially ban bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms.
2066 2018-12-18 17:40:00 Frankly I am not sure the DOJ should be able to ban anything if bump stocks should be banned I believe the Congress should have to vote on it
2067 2018-12-18 17:39:23 you do realize bump stocks are a red herring, right?...  gun owners probably should create more such toys to "give up", affecting no real change.
2068 2018-12-18 17:39:23 Bump Stocks are stupid range gimmicks but stupid range gimmicks are protected under the 2nd amendment.
2069 2018-12-18 17:39:12 Why would the Trump administration go after bump stocks?  Hope this is not true.

2073 2018-12-18 17:38:49 JUST IN: Justice Department Bans Bump Stocks, Devices Used In Deadly Las Vegas Shooting.
2074 2018-12-18 17:38:47 I'd have gladly traded this regulation for removing suppressors from NFA. Bump stocks are clearly a work-around to get 'automatic fire.' Spirit of the law/letter of the law thing. But, this regulation doesn't say they can be kept with a tax stamp like automatics, which is weird.
2075 2018-12-18 17:38:24 "Conversion kits" as you put it break the actual law. Bump stocks do not.  The laws are very specifically written.  Be interesting to see how far challenges against this go. And a note.  I hate bump stocks. Never had one.  Never even used one.  But I don't agree with this at all.
2076 2018-12-18 17:38:22 BREAKING: Trump will legalize bump stocks again if they are renamed “Trump stocks”
2077 2018-12-18 17:38:22 ....and this has what to do with bump stocks? This isn't a ban on AR-15s.

C'mon guys, go attack more ER doctors, since having your ass handed to you seems to be your new past time.

How's Butina by the way?
2078 2018-12-18 17:38:07 You know nothing about the right because everything you think you know comes from the left.  I am an advid gun rights person and I know NO ONE in gun circles that is upset by bump stocks being banned.  Simply put...  You don't know what you're talking about.
2079 2018-12-18 17:38:03 Bump stocks turn semiautomatic weapons into autos
2080 2018-12-18 17:38:01 So, Obama never came for our guns but Trump is coming for our bump stocks? This is an obvious feint. Sounds like Putin's mannequin wants to distance himself from NRAgate but will never follow through and incur the virulent spleen of the gun nut base.
2081 2018-12-18 17:37:56 Trump administration just banned bump stocks for guns, a move I wholly support. Holy shit! Doesn’t outweigh the festering pile of shit he’s done and is doing, but I do appreciate it.
2082 2018-12-18 17:37:42 I started investing in stocks in 2013 I think. Have been avoiding options so far, even if I understand the concept. But, if he wishes so, allocating small part of funds to get experience with options may not be bad idea.

2084 2018-12-18 17:37:22 @HalftimeReport @ScottWapnerCNBC #askhalftime Did I miss the memo where the world held hands and sang kumbaya? The defense stocks have taken a nose dive with no end in site. Is there a bottom for them, specifically Raytheon?
2085 2018-12-18 17:37:16 #BREAKING on @OANN: The Trump administration moves to officially ban bump stocks—which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms—making them illegal to possess beginning in late March. #OANN

2087 2018-12-18 17:37:07 Georgie Porgie who has his thumb in too many pies! He needs to be stored in the public square in stocks!
2088 2018-12-18 17:37:04 he benefits from family trusts, and thus has incentives to keep those stocks going high

when Rick Scott passed a drug-test-for-welfare law, he still had a conflict of interest even though he didn't personally hold any interests in drug test companies (he gave them to his wife)
2089 2018-12-18 17:36:51 I’d like to at least know what happened in Las Vegas before they ban the bump stocks. That shooting was the impetus behind this law.
2090 2018-12-18 17:36:30 If I didn’t have student loans, I would be putting a lot more money into weed stocks. Writing this now to look back on in 5 years and cry at the financial opportunity that I missed because I’m just a poor boy from a poor family.
2091 2018-12-18 17:36:27 The administration is also banning bump-stocks
2092 2018-12-18 17:36:05 Oh,  introduced by Democrats?
No Republican co-sponsors?
Are you surprised?  I'm not
-
"Two Senate Democrats introduced a bill on Wednesday to prevent members of Congress from trading stocks in industries tied to their legislative work."

2093 2018-12-18 17:36:03 The gravity Flynn (pleading guilty), and Trump Foundation (dissolving) the spin-deflection-machine is pushing out a Christmas Card, Space Force & now the expected ban on Bump Stocks. I can only imagine what deflection will happen @ the WH press briefing schd 1:30pm ET. Any bets?
2094 2018-12-18 17:35:55 The courts. The ATF makes these determinations based on the statutes defining what a machine gun is, and bump stocks don’t fit the definition. They reviewed these a few years back, and ruled that they were not machine guns based on the law. The law must be changed to do this.

2097 2018-12-18 17:35:42 This administration finally did something I can get on board with, banning bump stocks....Lets see what else will happen now that it's been proven Russia has played a big part in the NRA decision making process.  #CommonSenseGunReform
2098 2018-12-18 17:35:39 I cannot discuss individual stocks for compliance reasons. Check out our website for top 10 or follow my BNN shows.
2099 2018-12-18 17:35:36 Bump stocks? Really? You do realize the same thing can be done with idams from around the house don't  you?
What a dog and pony show of meaninglessness leftist donkey waist.
How about you deal with KSA and stop the fake moves like this.
2100 2018-12-18 17:35:35 Gold prices going up during festival seasons is especially bad for Jewelers.
People buy more jewelry during festival seasons than any other time and this is exactly when stocks are falling and gold price is going up - somebody is trying to make some profit or loss by false means
2101 2018-12-18 17:35:08 First it’s bump stocks, next it’s your actual guns....
2102 2018-12-18 17:34:57 @POTUSI Thought you were for the 2nd Amendment. The right to keep and bear arms SHALL NOT BE INFRINGD. Banning bump stocks infringes on the 2nd Amendment. It ok for police officers to have automatic M-16s but not citizens. If you sign this ban, we will know that you are a liar.
2103 2018-12-18 17:34:56 NOT a good day for trump! He has to dissolve his foundation (where his kids steal money) there will be NO government shutdown over the wall AND his admin. banned bump stocks. Thanks a lot, Obama!
2104 2018-12-18 17:34:39 But if I can’t have bump stocks how will I get to dress like a wannabe soldier and shoot hundreds of rounds per minute down range in my “come and take them” T-shirt??
2105 2018-12-18 17:34:31 Wasn’t Obama the guy who made bump stocks available??
2106 2018-12-18 17:34:27 I keep reading no asset class spared in 2018. Stocks, bonds, crypto, commodities, etc lost money. I’m confident not true for VC in 2018. # of VC backed startups founded each year that get to $1B in enterprise value not correlated to public markets. Has been that way for decades.
2107 2018-12-18 17:34:15 Sure there are better ways to solve economic efficiency and social equity, jobs, safety, etc. But even cutting the catch limit and having a race for fish would still result in fish stocks rebuilding because fish sustainability is ultimately all about how many fish die.

2110 2018-12-18 17:33:43 If you cannot see what's happening, then you are absolutely a fool. There is no hype, pure fact. Bump stocks are the (no pun intended) first shot in the war on guns. Next up will be any "rate increasing devices", with little or no definition. Then semiautomatics. Wait and see.
2111 2018-12-18 17:33:38 Bump fire stocks are gunstocks that are specially designed to make bumpfiring easier, which allows semi-automatic firearms to somewhat mimic the firing speed of fully automatic weapons. Bump fire stocks can be placed on a few common weapon platforms such as the AR or AK families.
2112 2018-12-18 17:33:36 POTUS just banned bump stocks. This means HE'S COMING FOR YOUR GUNS!!! Oh wait, he's not the black president? never mind then. carry on

2115 2018-12-18 17:32:57 Well, there is at least one good thing out of Trump admin: the banning of bump stocks. Now we just need to ban treasonous leaders
2116 2018-12-18 17:32:33 Dude, please educate yourself before tweeting.  Bump stocks are an accsecssery. They can be detached. You do not turn in your guns with the bump stock.

2121 2018-12-18 17:32:02 So trump is banning bump stocks which means everyone who has one is now a criminal. Super smart.
2122 2018-12-18 17:31:24 A couple of hours being pelted with rotten eggs in the public stocks would be a fitting punishment for the Trump families cynical abuse of charity

2129 2018-12-18 17:30:55 Trump is banning bump stocks.

2131 2018-12-18 17:30:10 I disagree. It is important to have leverage in the #Chinese #economy . We know that #American businesses will be leveraged by #Trump as a market for other countries'. But, if American #businesses are leveraged in the #Chinese #markets at the end of this trade war, stocks can go
2132 2018-12-18 17:30:08 Good good. I can buy more Stocks with same amount

2134 2018-12-18 17:30:01 Trump banned bump stocks. @FoxNews has a small article on the matter. The comments are hilarious. The "Law and Order" conservatives who frequent the website are all taking about their plans to not actually comply with the law and "destroy" their bump stocks. #HypocrisyAtItsFinest

2138 2018-12-18 17:29:34 I still think the Trump Administration needs to go but the move to ban bump stocks is a great one, albeit common sense, that will make America safer!
2139 2018-12-18 17:29:28 Remember that time it was proven with evidence that bump stocks were used in a mass shooting? 
Yeah, me neither...
2140 2018-12-18 17:29:17 And yet he jammed the only one he used. There’s a whole lot more to Stephen Paddock story than bump stocks and none of it is being told.
2141 2018-12-18 17:29:16 The 2017’s I’ve had were a notch above the 2015-2016’s I’ve had. Darker too. I think they’re pulling older stocks now.
2142 2018-12-18 17:29:13 Trump is going to ban bump stocks and not go for Wall funding? He is letting us all down

2143 2018-12-18 17:29:08 The Trump administration is moving to officially ban bump stocks but Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer just came-out as Pro-Bump Stock and will fight Trump against this Bill.
2144 2018-12-18 17:28:58 Because of this new ban it will embolden activist in the newly democrat controlled congress to think since the president banned bumb stocks theyw ill think that is now a new bipartisian effort to combat school violence @Slaughtertrades. Gun control will only happen...

2148 2018-12-18 17:28:30 The Trump administration moved Tuesday to officially ban bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms, and has made them illegal to possess beginning in late March.
2149 2018-12-18 17:28:30 Am I wrong in thinking that Trump banned bump stocks and dissolved Trump Org today to distract from Flynn's sentencing?
2150 2018-12-18 17:28:23 Hate to tell y'all this, but bump stocks don't change a damn thing about shootings. What a stupid ban by stupid people.

2159 2018-12-18 17:27:05 Not sure why you sent this to me but our is economy is doing great, and yes it's because of Trump. I don't deal with stocks so I'm not going to comment on it.
2160 2018-12-18 17:26:55 You can technically do the same thing these bump stocks do with your finger literally but what do I know. Lol
2161 2018-12-18 17:26:54 They lost bump stocks so they need to come up with something else their base likes.
2162 2018-12-18 17:26:46 I don't believe that if the government wishes for the production of bump stocks to stop I can accept that I don't however think you should be forced to give it up if you already have one
2163 2018-12-18 17:26:23 Good. Ban bump stocks. Do AR-15s next. Nobody needs this firepower.
2164 2018-12-18 17:26:22 @LeRaph_TV y a moyen que tu détournes des stocks  ? 
2165 2018-12-18 17:25:52 I have to say though that I am impressed and glad that the DOJ announced that bump stocks have been reclassified as machine guns and will be banned in the US.
2166 2018-12-18 17:25:43 Only "others" saying it wont change anything look like gun toting republicans to me who are pissed that they cant own bump stocks now
2167 2018-12-18 17:25:06 Banning bump stocks is just dumb and a political stunt that does nothing.  Mostly because bump stops are stupid and an asinine accessory. No sensible person puts a bump stock on and armalite rifle.

2169 2018-12-18 17:24:50 bump stocks are really bad but likely the real story why trump admin is banning them is they couldn't extort tons of cash from the companies who manufacture them.

2173 2018-12-18 17:24:10 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trump administration moves to officially ban bump stocks that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly.
2174 2018-12-18 17:24:06 So trump bans bump stocks and folks have 90 days to turn in theirs? Yeah I'm going to go out on a limb and say there will be massive non compliance. This is a betrayal of the electorate but folks shouldn't be surprised at this point
2175 2018-12-18 17:23:37 I don't think this is the right read. This is a sacrificial lamb and a distraction. Bump stocks are more stupid than dangerous, and few will care that they're gone. It's a concession that will be pointed to later, and I imagine the NRA backed this. Wouldn't be the first time.
2176 2018-12-18 17:23:25 Really? Bump Stocks compelled the shooter to kill others?
 Do you not know that a bump stock can be made out of pieces of plastic?

2182 2018-12-18 17:22:47 What Trump does.... he lies.... he snorts drugs... he is an admitted sexual predator. Farmers &businesses hv to be bailed out by taxpayers. Stocks are tanking. 401Ks tanking. World leaders laugh at him. He shows confusion a lot.

2186 2018-12-18 17:22:13 Getting real sick of Trump waffling on his promises. Backing down on the wall now banning bump stocks is going to cost him
2187 2018-12-18 17:21:59 So, the government is taking their gun (stocks) away!!!  I thought Obama was going to do that?
2188 2018-12-18 17:21:49 I'm going to find videos of people using Nunchucks in place of bump stocks.
2189 2018-12-18 17:21:44 How long before the pseudo resistance comes out in favor of bump stocks?
2190 2018-12-18 17:21:32 If bump stocks had been illegal then Stephen Paddock would not have been able to kill 58 innocent Americans.  Period. #gunsense laws work. And the majority of Americans want them
2191 2018-12-18 17:21:32 of course, a tool can be used a long time after it's made... wonder if there are any records of how fast they used up their harpoon stocks?

2193 2018-12-18 17:21:01 Inflation *always* follows to where the printed money lands.  
Massive inflation here indicates where the QE money mostly went:
- Art
- Vintage cars
- Top end real estate
- Gulfstream V's and VI's
- Rare gemstones
- Stocks & Bonds
Never mistake the CPI for "inflation."
2194 2018-12-18 17:20:56 Hey @ChrisCuomo, the unspoken point to this is that semi-automatic military style rifles can be fired freehand, at fire rates as fast or faster than a bump stock produces. 
Therefore, what's the point in banning bump stocks other than the illusion of taking action?
2195 2018-12-18 17:20:50 You’re mad they’re focusing on bump stocks yet cannot address them directly. Are you defending them as something that ought to be protected as legal? Let us hear it.
2196 2018-12-18 17:20:41 What's more likely? 

Trump banning bump stocks to play 5d chess and save something else? (Hpa is never getting passed yall. Accept it. Go buy a suppressor now)

Or

Trump banning bump stocks in an effort to win some favor with Democrats and anti gunners when reelection hits?
2197 2018-12-18 17:20:10 @Stephanie_Link I just watched you ( as I do everyday) on CNBC Fast Money..Excellently articulated you are 1000% correct on how we should be purchasing stocks. Your way is so right...thank you I am a huge fan take care
2198 2018-12-18 17:19:31 If bumpstocks are now 'machineguns' (lol) why cant owners just get an NFA tax stamp and register it as a legal machinegun?
I'm seeing claims that the stocks will have to be surrendered to the ATF.
2199 2018-12-18 17:19:11 Kudos to the Trump administration for banning bump stocks. This decision begs the Q: if a weapon is modeled after a weapon of war, is easily customizable into a fully automatic weapon, and has been used in multiple mass shootings, should it easily available to all?

2203 2018-12-18 17:18:43 I knew Trump was never a the biggest gun guy. All these stand around fud motherfuckers are okay with bump stocks because they believe he's playing 5d chess or some shit with anti gunners. No, he's saving his ass.
2204 2018-12-18 17:18:39 Some good news from the White House! Bump stocks to finally be banned! How many had to die before this was actually done? Trump still hasn't tweeted about this one piece of positive news because he's still too busy crying in public about being investigated!
2205 2018-12-18 17:18:39 Mau slogan awesomewoon, ada stocks sale juga ga dia?
2206 2018-12-18 17:18:19 I would sell my stocks on the Flynn out come in case Dumb as market commentators use it as an excuse
2207 2018-12-18 17:18:16 It doesn't do anything, you can 3D print it easily..this is a fake solution and don;t tell me at least it's something, they just lowered the bar so much that we celebrate banning bump stocks, the bullets should be banned
2208 2018-12-18 17:18:05 I'll believe it when I see it. I just have a hard time believing they'll turn in their bumb stocks.
2209 2018-12-18 17:18:04 Your boy just moved to ban bump-stocks.  How can he do that?   

Because it’s what the people want.  

RIP, bumpstock arguments
2210 2018-12-18 17:17:59 Time for tradable bounce up - @CNBC tells us about disastrous losses on stocks 
2211 2018-12-18 17:17:57 Mhm. I spread my stocks though. USA. CND. Global - pharma + other specific businesses. 

Why? CND banks dont crash. Pharma wont die. USA will have time to bounce back.
2212 2018-12-18 17:17:51 Trump Foundation dissolves. White House no longer demanding wall funding. Administration bans bump stocks and your president orders creation of US Space Command? All today. Hmmmmmm. #StayWoke
2213 2018-12-18 17:17:42 BREAKING NEWS.... TRUMPS BANS BUMP STOCKS.... THIS  MAKES SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS MACHINE GUNS.
2214 2018-12-18 17:17:42 trump making bump stocks illegal has been the only piece of respectable legislation he has passed or wants to pass
2215 2018-12-18 17:17:36 @MACD50 5g will help all optical stocks-
2216 2018-12-18 17:17:26 #TuesdayThoughts Thanks to President Trump bump stocks are now illegal today
2217 2018-12-18 17:17:24 hi i’d just like to inform you all that bump stocks have been banned by our federal government and today is a good day. that is all. happy holidays.

2219 2018-12-18 17:17:09 Stocks up not much changed.  I'm reminded of my early studies when I took bar chart graphs and put them on the floor and stood back from them. That's a great way to lessen focus on all these gyrations that go nowhere and see the large trends. TREND STILL DOWN. Enjoy the ride

2221 2018-12-18 17:16:39 @WheelerLydia Your article regarding the bump stock ban contains a factual inaccuracy regarding their function Please revise the assertion that bump stocks "...fire multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger..."
2222 2018-12-18 17:16:12 Stocks are set to have their worst December since the Great Depression.  Corporate stock buybacks, which allow corporate executives to make MILLIONS and avoid taxes thanks to your new permanent tax laws, are skyrocketing at the expense of the lower and middle class.
2223 2018-12-18 17:16:11 What day you @realDonaldTrump to all your constituents that you made felons, with the ban on bump stocks?
2224 2018-12-18 17:16:10 Still waiting to hear what he thinks about the bump stocks.

2228 2018-12-18 17:15:42 Obama March 3, 2009:
"What you're now seeing is profit-and-earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you've got a long-term perspective on it."
2229 2018-12-18 17:15:42 I always thought that when you were in a Bull market stocks and securities were at a high.  If it is a Bear Market stocks snd securities are low.  So the best bet is buy low sell high.  Right now the market is very volatile because of the political climate so I am sitting tight.
2230 2018-12-18 17:15:33 what makes you think that correlation between those stocks will be different for $aapl, i agree being bearish generally for mainstream stocks but i think same goes for apple tbh
2231 2018-12-18 17:15:20 Because it was impossible to hunt large game before bump stocks, which is why white men were able to hunt bison into extinction... right?
2232 2018-12-18 17:15:15 $HMY gold stocks are really heating up the last few days.
2233 2018-12-18 17:15:15 The Trump administration has officially banned bump stocks, it might just be the first good thing they have done.

But there is still much more to do.
2234 2018-12-18 17:15:14 U.S. stocks pared an advance as a rout in crude dragged down oil producers, limiting the recovery after yesterday’s drop to a 14-month low - Bloomberg
2235 2018-12-18 17:15:14 All I’m saying is obama didn’t ban bump stocks 
2236 2018-12-18 17:15:13 I've shed everything extra from the house in case I have to move. I've just checked the food stocks to make sure everthing is within useby. Bring it on then I'll roll with it.
2237 2018-12-18 17:14:54 Martha Stewart served 5 months in prison for lying about an insider tip that led her to dumping 42K of stocks.

Flynn is trying to avoid prison after using his insider knowledge to destroy America’s democracy. He conspired with RU to manipulate our election process

2238 2018-12-18 17:14:45 Starting an electrical fire trying to make bump stocks on my $130 thinkgeek 3d printer
2239 2018-12-18 17:14:31 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2240 2018-12-18 17:14:28 Right, the stocks dip it’s Trumps..the stocks climb its Obama’s...which is it?? Can’t have it both ways.
2241 2018-12-18 17:14:27 Banning bump stocks was a clear (and good) choice. But this can't be the end -- we should make this the start of passing true, common-sense gun safety laws to make our communities safer.
2242 2018-12-18 17:14:24 Lol bump stocks made to be illegal 
2243 2018-12-18 17:14:21 The Trump admin has banned bump stocks, as of today. These devices allow semi-automatic weapons to fire more rapidly, one step in the right direction.
But my question is, why were these ever legal for public usage in the first place??
2244 2018-12-18 17:14:01 "There is nothing like price to change sentiment."
Happens every time.
In our market of confident talking heads and changing market structure (ETFs, quants) - "buyers live higher and sellers like lower."
Buying stocks based on intrinsic value/security analysis 
@cnbcfastmoney
2245 2018-12-18 17:13:49 It's barely noon in DC and already:
—Trump has backtracked and agreed to ban bump-stocks
—the Trump Foundation is dissolving (but will still be investigated by the New York AG's office)
—the right-wing propaganda that surrounded Flynn was utterly dismantled by a federal judge
2246 2018-12-18 17:13:45 It was all such obvious theater. Now in 2020 he can run on prison reform and banning bump stocks. Biggest 2nd amendment president ever!
2247 2018-12-18 17:13:42 I have said this since they passed, seems to be every trump supporters defense and of course blaming Hilary or Obama. I decided to let them brag about the great economy and funny now they can barely look me in the eye now that the stocks are tanking. I will be floating in April
2248 2018-12-18 17:13:03 I mean in all seriousness, do you honestly believe that they are going to stop at bump stocks or "assault weapons"? You truly think this is about commonsense and not the death of the 2A by a thousand cuts? They won't stop here. It will keep going until nothing remains.
2249 2018-12-18 17:13:02 Tech stocks lead the charge for Wall Street's gains today.
2250 2018-12-18 17:12:56 Stocks give up 1/2 their gains. Mortgage Bonds at session highs.
2251 2018-12-18 17:12:56 Maybe 30% will actually comply. Black market will thrive. More could have been done. More Kuerigs were destroyed then bump stocks will ever be.
2252 2018-12-18 17:12:48 His supporters will think “Bump Stocks” have to do with the stock market and will ignore it.
2253 2018-12-18 17:12:45 Bought $BCC a little before the 20 & 50 ema crossed over on the 15 min. So far so good. I feel like lumber, and gold stocks could start a bull run soon.
2254 2018-12-18 17:12:44 Im sad. I'm canadian. I got USA stocks. I haven't looked in months since Trump started a trade war.
2255 2018-12-18 17:12:18 Stocks open higher. Dow +200 points.

2257 2018-12-18 17:12:12 Stock market on pace for worst December since Great Depression...

 GREENSPAN: RUN FOR COVER! 

 Foreigners Dump Treasuries, Liquidate Stocks...
2258 2018-12-18 17:12:06 As a general rule, I am not cool with judges popping a gasket because he thinks prosecutors undercharged. Looking a side-eyed at some civil libertarians I know who are hoping Judge Sullivan brings back the stocks and public flogging.
2259 2018-12-18 17:12:00 How many bump stocks were  actually sold...not that many I bet.  I never heard of them until Las Vegas
2260 2018-12-18 17:11:36 buh-bye bump stocks
2261 2018-12-18 17:11:31 Everyone that owns bump stocks is totally going to destroy them.
2262 2018-12-18 17:11:27 If low profile (small church) then I would just continue my side hustles I.e. real estate and stocks. And if I generate wealth from that I don’t see the problem. You don’t have to be poor to be a pastor.
2263 2018-12-18 17:11:26 I also want a public listing of all stocks they hold and that cross-referenced with any bills they introduce and/or support.
2264 2018-12-18 17:11:23 Trump Foundation dissolving.
Michael Flynn facing possible prison.
Bump stocks banned.

Can't wait to hear from @PressSec today about how the White House is really *clenched fist* OWNING THE LIBS!

2266 2018-12-18 17:11:22 You really have to love the news about bump stocks and US Space Command. Very subtle attempt at distraction.
2267 2018-12-18 17:11:06 Don't play with 2 stocks or any timer less than 6 please. That creates such a stressful environment that forces rash decisions.
2268 2018-12-18 17:11:02 And the fees to buy stocks!!!!!!!!!!!! EXCESSIVE
2269 2018-12-18 17:10:54 And give billions to rich corporations who would fail to use it for trickle down, but buy back their stocks instead. Your career has been a waste of time.
2270 2018-12-18 17:10:50 Agreed. investing in IRA, stocks, and real estate make your money work.
2271 2018-12-18 17:10:44 The top five most active stocks at noon today are $GE, $AMD. $BAC, $ORCL, and $F.
2272 2018-12-18 17:10:32 Just a reminder that Martha Stewart served 5 months in prison followed by house arrest because she lied about selling 42K of stocks following insider tip.

Michael Flynn worked with an adversarial Russia to manipulate America’s democracy.  He’s a traitor.

2273 2018-12-18 17:10:00 trump banned bump stocks and i’m honestly surprised he did a good thing but i’m here for it

2275 2018-12-18 17:09:43 Lol good one. Now let's see what other stocks you are in 
2276 2018-12-18 17:09:43 Which company produces the most bump stocks?
2277 2018-12-18 17:09:35 There will be no revolution or Flashpoint on Gun Control. All the cope on Bump stocks prove this. 

"Stupid accessory anyway" will turn into "Who needs more than 10 rounds?" and then "Nobody really needs an AR15" and so on until they drill down and have them all. change my mind.
2278 2018-12-18 17:09:25 Second one … stocks fluctuate, that’s what they do
2279 2018-12-18 17:09:07 Trump banning bump gun stocks is the best thing he’s done in office. We’re almost three years into his term.
2280 2018-12-18 17:08:45 If it will go higher.. why would it have to go lower to find a bottom?
Fundamentals for (US) stocks are good and FED shouldn't behave stupidly.. So I see no reason why stocks should still get cheaper when we know future looks bright...
2281 2018-12-18 17:08:39 This was an accident, right?  They meant to, like, discount bump stocks?  Or give them away when you buy your gun?
2282 2018-12-18 17:08:16 Many people have bump stocks and don't misusethem I am not sure hundreds of people should have to give them up because of one person
2283 2018-12-18 17:08:10 Yep. Same here. It's freaking annoying. Also, WILL YOU PEOPLE GET AWAY FROM 2 STOCKS!! DAMN! FFS! ULTIMATE'S DAMAGE BUFF AND SPEED REQUIRES MORE TIME TO ENJOY A FRIGGIN MATCH! LEAVE THAT SHIT IN SMASH 4.  
I'm just saying. 
2284 2018-12-18 17:08:01 What does that even mean?  Oops we shouldn’t have leaked this?
2285 2018-12-18 17:07:49 j’avais trouvé le cadeau d’Amy : plus sa taille disponible

j’avais trouvé le cadeau de Claire : rupture de stocks 
J’AI DE LA CHANCE QUAND ?
2286 2018-12-18 17:07:47 If they end up compensating the people who turn in their bump stocks that would satisfy the 5th Amendment
2287 2018-12-18 17:07:42 He was elaborating that there is more than one accessory(even though bump stocks being banned does nothing as their are alternatives using basic household items)
2288 2018-12-18 17:07:30 Kid you have no clue. Everyone knows I have enough money to buy or bury stocks 
2289 2018-12-18 17:07:30 US stocks surge upon federal Judge telling Michael Flynn he sold his country out.
2290 2018-12-18 17:07:25 The Trump administration banned bump stocks? I’m actually pleasantly surprised.
2291 2018-12-18 17:07:24 There's no real reason to. In the overall gun violence issue in America, bump stocks are not a contributing factor. Congress, while they're not really doing much of anything, they shouldn't be dealing in feel good legislation that has zero impact.
2292 2018-12-18 17:07:21 Allyson 2 times then sell off all my stocks for more
2293 2018-12-18 17:07:13 i'm not sure how i feel about stocks, they've been throttled
2294 2018-12-18 17:06:52 Buy me stocks and shoes for xmas
2295 2018-12-18 17:06:50 Bump stocks
2296 2018-12-18 17:06:49 The printed guns are total crap, and dangerous to the user. I don’t think the bump stocks would be any better.
2297 2018-12-18 17:06:45 Possibly the only positive of the Trump administration is them banning Bump Stocks. Other than that...TRASH! LITERAL GARBAGE. Thank you 1st amendment for allowing me to say that and not have SS at my door.  Good day!
2298 2018-12-18 17:06:43 No just bump stocks he’s not gonna ban guns, I promise you.
2299 2018-12-18 17:06:41 Bump stocks have zero to do with that tweet.
2300 2018-12-18 17:06:34 Trump administration moves to ban bump stocks...
2301 2018-12-18 17:06:18 @HalftimeReport So what is Gundlach's track record on calling stocks on CNBC? You sound proud that you had a Bond "king" on yesterday to scare the stock market. That's not your role. #CNBC
2302 2018-12-18 17:06:17 Attn militias! #45 is coming for your Bump Stocks like Obama didn’t!#TuesdayThoughts #bumpStock boogies
2303 2018-12-18 17:06:02 Where in the Wealth of Nations, does Adam Smith talk about bailouts like TARP? Or how about Quantitative Easing (QE). Bernanke was trying to create the wealth effect and boy did he. While the recovery was the weakest since the end of WW2, stocks tripled.
2304 2018-12-18 17:05:56 And remember when the stocks were up and the mainstream media, the left, did not want to talk about it.  Matter fact most of them didn't. Why don't you continue that. Fair and balanced.
2305 2018-12-18 17:05:53 Good news for potential/future innocent victims of shootings involving bump stocks.
Why would any civilian need to own anything like that?
2306 2018-12-18 17:05:49 Stocks on track for worst December since the Great Depression
2307 2018-12-18 17:05:43 Remember Bill Gross (former bond King) in spring 2009 saying stocks stunk so bad you could smell them? That sub 5% returns in stocks were the new normal?  Gundlach is the new Bill Gross. And CNBC NEVER misses a chance to yell fire in a crowded theater. You don’t add value.
2308 2018-12-18 17:05:24 by the same people who said in late September that stocks were set to break out and SP was hitting 3000-3100.
2309 2018-12-18 17:05:23 What is there to argue about? Hes banning bump stocks and you're acting as if hes asking every gun owner in America to turn in all their guns. Theres nothing to discuss besides people like you being upset lmao
2310 2018-12-18 17:05:16 I do not believe the federal government should be able to seize bump stocks from the American people.
2311 2018-12-18 17:05:03 Good quote from Alan Grayson who said that in Congress years ago, with an easel. Shame he was too right by being Left for those Demorepubs. Scared the stocks outta 'em. #Medicareforallornothing
2312 2018-12-18 17:04:57 Liberals then: “Why are bump stocks legal they should be banned!”

Liberals now: “Oh it won’t change a thing it’s a useless ban”
2313 2018-12-18 17:04:52 Bump stocks are not guns. He’s not taking guns away I promise you that.
2314 2018-12-18 17:04:44 LOL
Bump stocks take just as much practice and are a useless item when it comes to controlled firing of a weapon.

I had rather face an idiot using a bump stock than one without
2315 2018-12-18 17:04:14 If you play 3 minutes and 3 stocks online we all know what you are doing you coward
2316 2018-12-18 17:04:13 trump is tossing out all kinds of shiny objects (press briefing, bump stocks ban etc) in order to distract from the fact that Flynn flipped on him, committed crimes against the United States of America and is being sentenced today...doesn't seem to be working though...finally 
2317 2018-12-18 17:04:08 @realDonaldTrump why no tweet about your administrations decision to ban bump stocks?  You actually did something good!  You are actually making America safer! Take credit! #thankyou #CommonSenseGunLaws
2318 2018-12-18 17:04:06 Yeah…no one is surrendering their bump stocks. Especially not the batshit crazy people who need to.

2320 2018-12-18 17:03:53 According to the FBI uniform crime report. More people were killed by hammers than rifles with bump stocks in 2017. But this will make the people feel safer lol.
2321 2018-12-18 17:03:43 The Trump administration will shortly ban bump stocks. In other news, Democrat strategists were up late last night determining how to diss him for it.

2324 2018-12-18 17:03:36 trump's administration really ban bumped stocks. wow. 
thank you so much.  i hope this isnt a secret agenda or this brings anything terrible. thank you @POTUS
2325 2018-12-18 17:03:27 Trump Admin banning bump stocks.  Is this the first thing they have ever done that is right?  And will his cult accept it??
2326 2018-12-18 17:03:11 This is why I like Twitter. 
Not about the stocks so much ….. but the camaraderie  of people I’ve never met … but have known for almost 15 years.    and then one of my friends relates to one of my followers.  It’s cool.  
Joe + Dan  . Thanks.
2327 2018-12-18 17:02:48 If Russia’s economy ever entered a position where it could mount a global offensive against the US and destroy it’s Military, I highly doubt your over weight ass is going to hold them off with a couple bump-stocks and extended mags.
2328 2018-12-18 17:02:35 how did the bond king make money? if he didnt make it in stocks, why do we care what his opinion is on stocks?
2329 2018-12-18 17:02:31 Pretty happy that @realDonaldTrump is officially banning bump stocks.
2330 2018-12-18 17:02:18 Couldn't agree more, investors time is coming when the market is down and stocks are cheap.
2331 2018-12-18 17:02:17 I thought that bump stocks were banned a little while ago....but that it didn't happen for some reason. Can someone who knows pls elaborate? I'm wondering if this ban will actually produce results?
2332 2018-12-18 17:02:16 LRT Trump banned bump stocks? I'm just...thats really good but what the fuck
2333 2018-12-18 17:02:09 Wow. Something positive for a change. Meanwhile, other stocks are being bumped down.
2334 2018-12-18 17:01:59 Bump stocks aren’t guns. Do you know how many people actually own bump stocks? Myself or anyone else i know has never even thought about purchasing one
2335 2018-12-18 17:01:48 @NPR problem is those standn out in #3DPrinting who makes 3DPrintable bump stocks& @StateDept @NRA do ya realize ya would literally need to search everysever to check for how many people have it&then shut it down, without that its unknown how many #bumpStocks are out they’re
2336 2018-12-18 17:01:46 And hopefully the American Association of People with Disabilities will sue... seeing as some people with disabilities need the bump stocks to shoot their guns...
2337 2018-12-18 17:01:44 Yeah but electric lights are made from bump stocks. They're unusable
2338 2018-12-18 17:01:14 As of December 14th, 2018 is the only year since 1970 in which every single one of the six major asset classes (US stocks, international stocks, treasury bonds, corporate bonds, high yield (junk) bonds, and commodity futures) has had a negative return. Weird!
2339 2018-12-18 17:01:13 @FoxNews why no story on Trump banning bump stocks?  Literally no mention at all on your website as of posting this, yet every other major news source is running the story.  Trying to keep your followers in the dark for some reason?  What gives?
2340 2018-12-18 17:00:53 They know exactly how bump stocks work. A few years ago they explicitly said they weren't machine guns. The problem with the ATF is not ignorance. It's malevolence. If you own a bump stock, hide your wife, children, and pets. They're all targets now.
2341 2018-12-18 17:00:49 But they don’t need bump stocks. The rifle will stay legal

2345 2018-12-18 17:00:34 Trump coming for your guns y’all  #trump bans bump stocks
2346 2018-12-18 17:00:30 I don’t like bump stocks but banning them do nothing. You can use a belt loop on your pants to do the same thing. Are they going to ban belt loops also?
2347 2018-12-18 17:00:23 I am comfortable applauding #Trump and his administration for banning bump stocks. 

it's a little late, but better than never.
2348 2018-12-18 17:00:18 “Obama is cummin fur muh gunz!”   Meanwhile Trump bans bump stocks. Same dude “Trump 2020!”
2349 2018-12-18 17:00:06 Patti bump stocks are not machine guns. It’s pretty clear this is a political move and will backfire. How can the justice department just decide to ban these after the ATF ruled twice they are not machine guns or are you sayin you know more than gun experts at the ATF
2350 2018-12-18 17:00:05 The guy said something that had no correlation with reality. It's actually if you were with Elon since Tesla started, you surely have SpaceX stocks also. Especially if you were an early employee of it.
2351 2018-12-18 16:59:57 Wow! What a shake up.   I might sell my stocks in WWE now.  (Titanic is near)
2352 2018-12-18 16:59:54 ENERGY STOCKS CRASHING AND BURNING...
2353 2018-12-18 16:59:45 Tens of thousands of bump stocks in the US. Huh. So why isn’t there more carnage?
2354 2018-12-18 16:59:21 You can do many things with practice. Bump stocks mean you don’t have to.

How is “stopping making this easier” a hard concept for you to grasp.
2355 2018-12-18 16:59:17 Market and $VXX are up at the same time. With this steep backwardation on the $VIX curve, my money is on higher vix, lower stocks.
2356 2018-12-18 16:59:16 I’d love to see meaningful gun legislation, but banning bump stocks isn’t it.  It’s a feel-good law, with no chance of lowering gun violence in the US. How about banning bump stocks AND mental health check AND smaller clip size.
2357 2018-12-18 16:59:13 Our MP was a hard Brexiter, but it appears even she has changed her mind. Put Cameron in the stocks, I say.
2358 2018-12-18 16:58:54 Trump Foundation dissolving. Trump DOJ banning bump stocks. Sounds like "someone" remembered Christmas is in a week & has a whole lotta naughty to make up for. Little tip: end the state-sanction child abuse at the border & you just might make #Santasnicelist
2359 2018-12-18 16:58:13 And now for us to ban all of the alternatives to bump stocks. Like rubberbands, paper clips, cardboard, trained trigger fingers.... Did this even do anything?
2360 2018-12-18 16:58:08 Canadian energy stocks: bottomless. Looks like oil's en route to $46.
2361 2018-12-18 16:57:49 Even if you bought the same stocks back, you will view them differently, with a clear head.
2362 2018-12-18 16:57:49 #Wildebeest_Milk. "Tastes like chicken. Try some, at Hakuna Matata's. Free Simba Shake with your Pumba Buns ...while stocks and shares last ...terms and conditions may apply ...see obfuscated annex for details" Must we quarrel about such things?
2363 2018-12-18 16:57:44 Trump bans bump stocks.  The attack on the constitution of both the first and second amendment continues.
2364 2018-12-18 16:57:34 The NASD OTC Market closed today Tuesday, 18 December on a positive note, as NASD USI and Market Capitalisation appreciated by 1.39% to close at 714.70 points and ₦496.73 billion respectively.

2365 2018-12-18 16:57:32 Where are all the liberals and anti- gun groups hiding, when they should be praising the President today and his decision to ban all bump stocks. This is a President of action, when he says he is going to do something, he finds a way to get it done.
2366 2018-12-18 16:57:12 They should be banning the guns themselves, not just the stocks
2367 2018-12-18 16:56:57 So what about bump-stocks... Are you filing a lawsuit yet?
2368 2018-12-18 16:56:55 WASHINGTON (AP) — Trump administration moves to officially ban bump stocks that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly.
2369 2018-12-18 16:56:45 I do think stocks can come down a lot but the bond market goes through these "end of the world episodes" every couple years.

2016 was a shocking example. I remember looking through the US Treasury auctions and saw the yields people were buying. Total malfeasance.
2370 2018-12-18 16:56:31 All of my stocks beg to differ....
2371 2018-12-18 16:56:08 I greatly injured, no farther than for the stocks were all the oldest, and if you long to be very smart young man of course
2372 2018-12-18 16:56:02 Wait, I thought Trump was in the pocket of the NRA?
The NRA has lobbied hard against banning bump stocks...

I don't care, leaning more towards eliminating them than not.
No need for Bump Stocks in hunting - recreation only.
It's an accessory, not a weapon, so it is legal to ban.
2373 2018-12-18 16:55:58 Seeing a lot of bio stocks BIIB, the CRSPR sector, SGMO, getting hit, too. Meh. Volatility. Trying to stay disciplined and not add AMRN calls. Tempting. Lol.
2374 2018-12-18 16:55:42 I would love for my iPhone to have a pool report feature for breaking news. I hate getting 10 push alerts about bump stocks (after reading on twitter) and then 10 push alerts about Flynn (also after reading on twitter). Just one alert would be 
2375 2018-12-18 16:55:35 Didn’t ATF conclude some years ago that the necessary/relevant federal law could not be used to ban bump-stocks because such devices did not involve the actual workings of such an equipped firearm?

What changed?
2376 2018-12-18 16:55:30 Wonder how much of the recent negative volatility in S&P averages is due to the #FAANG stocks? Seems like when they started taking on some water, the whole market started floundering,
2377 2018-12-18 16:55:29 Strictly for work purposes. Closing stocks now would allow traders to focus on Christmas shopping. One of many, many benefits.
2378 2018-12-18 16:55:23 There are 157 stocks in the S&P 500 that yield over 3%. Of those, 67 yield more than 4%.
2379 2018-12-18 16:55:15 Sean you want bump stocks available to the public?
2380 2018-12-18 16:54:59 I don't agree with the new rule banning bump stocks there is no proof that banning bumpstocks or banning any type of guns will somehow reduce gun violence.
2381 2018-12-18 16:54:21 The City of Denver banned Bump Stocks a few years ago. Exactly ZERO have been confiscated or turned in.  This is a political ploy with no real benefit.
2382 2018-12-18 16:54:19 @AOTtrades are there stocks that you have on your watchlist all year long?
2383 2018-12-18 16:54:01 Via @scotiabank : U.S. Stocks Rise After Sharp Selloff on Wall Street; Dow industrials recover, but is still down more than 6.5% in December and on track for its worst month since May of 2010

2385 2018-12-18 16:53:33 As trump band bump stocks
2386 2018-12-18 16:53:30 Huge mistake! And I’m not even a fan of bump stocks!
2387 2018-12-18 16:52:47 Wouldn’t this violate the ADA, since bump firing stocks were developed so that disabled individuals could use firearms?
2388 2018-12-18 16:52:39 TX rule on the ACA caused health care stocks to tumble.

2392 2018-12-18 16:52:02 LOL @ATFHQ, you know that's not how bump stocks work. Why you gotta be lyin?
2393 2018-12-18 16:51:48 Banning bump stocks is basically just a symbolic thing to do - it isn't going to stop these shootings. This is almost the definition of too little too late.
2394 2018-12-18 16:51:46 thanks, appreciate it! trying to get better everyday, this is a steep learning process especially when you have some bad habits (aka low float stocks) from before ..haha
2395 2018-12-18 16:51:23 Bonus: as a distraction, the admin claims to be working to ban bump stocks...a year or two too late.
2396 2018-12-18 16:51:11 Serious gun owner here and non-fan of bump stocks. My concerns are threefold:

1) This is an infringement and contra 2A
2) Can this ban in any way be stretched to ban anything other than BS? (cause you know someone will try)
3) What do we get in return?
2397 2018-12-18 16:50:47 trump!!! banned!!! bump stocks!!!
2398 2018-12-18 16:50:37 yea I've definitely lost stocks because of controls in this game
2399 2018-12-18 16:50:33 Next on the market...Springy shoulder pads that allow the same functionality as bump stocks, but they are clothing...just the next product to keep the gun grabbers busy ;)
2400 2018-12-18 16:50:26 It IS great that bump stocks have been banned, but I still want to see a guillotine
2401 2018-12-18 16:50:23 The bump stocks that are already in our possession; will they be “grandfathered”in ,or will they be confiscated?
2402 2018-12-18 16:50:23 Unlike the rest of Washington, Trump is able to independently accept or decline support without financial concerns.  If he wants to make bump stocks illegal, than he will, regardless of NRA Support (for example).  His #AmericaFirst agenda is real, refreshing and effective.
2403 2018-12-18 16:50:15 Trump caves on "boarder" wall/govt shutdown, forced to close his foundation and give $ to legit charities, and Congress bans bump stocks #NRARussia; meanwhile, Flynn being sentenced after pleading guilty.

2404 2018-12-18 16:50:07 @realDonaldTrump Thank you for banning bump stocks
2405 2018-12-18 16:49:57 Trump Foundation is dissolving because it’s a slush fund AND bump stocks have been banned?  Well, hello Tuesday!

2407 2018-12-18 16:49:56 Trump administration moves to ban bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic gun to fire like automatic weapons. Ban to go into effect by next March.
2408 2018-12-18 16:49:54 The private education stocks are great lead indicators. AdVTech’s upmarket Crawford brand & it’s elite schools has seen droves of kids yanked from schools / main reason EMIGRATION of entrepreneurs, skills & defacto tax base - your housing story adds to the pot.
2409 2018-12-18 16:49:47 Didn't u see what I said about $ORCL $44 TO $48. Not much to move. Same at $TGT target is dead stocks. They play options only. Target dead next year couldn't even back to $78. So good to sale Call Option. I did and Shorted.
2410 2018-12-18 16:49:22 Interesting... i can't wait to see how his base reconciles this. With this said, even the NRA said to do this. It's almost like banning bump stocks was just to pacify the Democrats, but don't bother gin enthusiasts at all.
2411 2018-12-18 16:49:10 The market cannot rally because ...tax selling. 69% of stocks are down for the year and the average down is -29.55%. Traditional managers, hedge funds and financial advisors are unloading their mistakes. Every rally is now in sell mode why can't the #pundits understand this...
2412 2018-12-18 16:49:06 Bought 3 shares of apple this morning! First big investment! Climb baby climb! #Stocks #Wallstreet #Apple
2413 2018-12-18 16:48:59 Lmao, this. If I was American, I would buy one just to thumb my nose at gun grabbers. But bump stocks are shitty and lame mallninja garbage. So I wouldn't want to actually INSTALL it on anything.
2414 2018-12-18 16:48:58 This, the foundation, and bump stocks...all at once. Go figure. 
2415 2018-12-18 16:48:55 Doesn't really answer my question though. Why is the GOP at a point where simply banning bump stocks is not politically feasible for them?
2416 2018-12-18 16:48:50 To be fair, I think bump stocks are fucking stupid, but that's not really the point. This sets a dangerous precedent.
2417 2018-12-18 16:48:49 guess just like everyone overpaid for stocks
2418 2018-12-18 16:48:18 ещё б запретить россиянам пользоваться приложением stocks в айфонах

2423 2018-12-18 16:47:33 Closed the Trump Fdn. All-in on Space Command. Flynn is guilty. Bump stocks being banned. It isn’t even noon on Tuesday. 
2424 2018-12-18 16:47:28 First they came for the bump stocks..
2425 2018-12-18 16:47:10 You can't predict the future for price discovery on the upside but you can place technical targets on the downside based on previous tops/bottoms etc. You think BTC is going full bull 2019 while stocks will go into a recession? Lmao then
2426 2018-12-18 16:47:06 I wish I still lived in Olde Richmond only because I am craving Stocks pound cake 
2427 2018-12-18 16:46:58 Tracking the numbers of bump stocks turned in to police agencies. New Jersey has reported 0% compliance with their recent magazine limit law. NY state found 96% non-compliance after their "assault weapon" ban passed.
2428 2018-12-18 16:46:57 No Constitutional "RIGHT" to "keep and bear" bump stocks. Totally separate issue from unConstitutional laws "infringing" on 2 Amendment gun rights.
2429 2018-12-18 16:46:55 Rename them “Trump Stocks” they go on sale next week.
2430 2018-12-18 16:46:42 I will give him credit where it is due. They finally banned bump stocks.
2431 2018-12-18 16:46:39 There is no need for bump stocks for anyone.
2432 2018-12-18 16:46:29 @PeachyINTELLECT I'll be ready for class in 2019. I need to get my trade and stocks in order.
2433 2018-12-18 16:46:29 Trump Foundation shutting down for fraud, visiting Arlington Cemetery for a few minutes in the rain, and now banning bump stocks. Pretty clear he's scrambling for approval from anyone he can get it out of.

2438 2018-12-18 16:45:51 Too much going on: bump stocks ban, reconsidering unfair school punishment rules, Flynn sentencing, govt shutdown ...
2439 2018-12-18 16:45:34 #Trump admin bans bump stocks? Oh hell now all the #2ndAmendment nuts call for his impeachment. 
2440 2018-12-18 16:45:33 Apparently the Trump administration banned bump stocks.

As much as it's almost respectable that he wouldn't do the base-friendly thing on this one, I can't help but think that he's just increasingly nervous about being overthrown by an armed populace.
2441 2018-12-18 16:45:17 Oh no  Is sportscene the only store that stocks it now?
2442 2018-12-18 16:45:15 Banning bump stocks is a win in the gun control debate.
2443 2018-12-18 16:45:15 vix or stocks ?
2444 2018-12-18 16:45:12 #stocks and #crude massively diverging today. Is one of the two lying? : #OOTT
2445 2018-12-18 16:45:11 Big news emerging from US – finally some meaningful gun reform coming. 

Trump admin is moving to ban bump stocks (which effectively turn regular guns into automatic weapons). Will be illegal to possess one by late March.
2446 2018-12-18 16:44:46 Can't wait to see if/when NRA pushes back, unless it's a coordinated effort with manufacturers to sell a shit ton of contraband bump stocks, which will become even more valuable after the ban.  Hard to tell with this administration.
2447 2018-12-18 16:44:34 I have dramatically reduced my long positions, and added shorts. There are stocks that will drop, regardless of economy. I don’t know when the trade dispute will be resolved, hopefully by Mar 2. I’m not willing to put on any major spec longs given the current poisonous environmen
2448 2018-12-18 16:44:33 Stocks having worst December in 87 years
Only on paper though we have a great economy right now there is some correction but that’s about it no one is losing their jobs people are making more income this is a great economy right now thank you Mr. President!
2449 2018-12-18 16:44:32 Corporations that got huge tax cuts are now done buying back their stocks ( instead of investing in production or employees)  The buy backs are what inflated or raised the stock market. Fake economics gain.
2450 2018-12-18 16:44:19 We should end 2018 right now, while stocks are higher for the day.
2451 2018-12-18 16:43:21 JUDGE: Mr. Flynn, how do you plead?

TRUMP: Here's my Christmas photo!

FLYNN: I plead guilty, your honor.

TRUMP: I'm banning bump stocks!

JUDGE: Are you sure of your plea?

TRUMP: We're averting the shutdown!
2452 2018-12-18 16:43:14 Sentiment sucks! Nobody wants to hold risky stocks in this market.
2453 2018-12-18 16:43:11 Why the fuck would you care?

You met any of the schmucks?  Let them eat stocks.
2454 2018-12-18 16:43:06 Trump is coming for your bump stocks.
2455 2018-12-18 16:43:01 Moves to ban is different than actually banning bump stocks.
2456 2018-12-18 16:42:56 More like cuck stocks
2457 2018-12-18 16:42:46 & Man U stocks start goin up as Mourinho leaves 
2458 2018-12-18 16:42:39 I thought stocks of Unadkat will plummet after last year's salary/performance disparity.But proved wrong...
2459 2018-12-18 16:42:11 And it's only Tuesday RT @markos: What a day for the traitor in the White House! Caves to Pelosi and the Dems after televised “negotiating” session backfires hilariously, takes bump stocks away from his base, pissing off core supporters, and his criminal “charity” gets shut down.
2460 2018-12-18 16:42:05 Stocks are Up this morning after yesterday's big selloff.  MBS are also up (+16bps), as Interest Rates improve.  Yields have slipped to 2.83%.  Stay tuned for Today's Market Report with more Market Info.
2461 2018-12-18 16:42:05 The order is not Constitutional, doesn't pass Heller or other rulings. That said, nobody cares because bump stocks are a useless gimmick. Sales were minor and have plummeted over the past few years.
2462 2018-12-18 16:41:57 Can anyone in the #MSM live tweet Trump's reaction to the 3 smacks he's had in the last few hrs? Did he overturn a desk or just throw the remote? 
1. Bump stocks. Bye bye
2. Trump Foundation. Bye bye
3. Flynn knew. Bye bye.
2463 2018-12-18 16:41:56 Stocks up today
2464 2018-12-18 16:41:54 Stocks tanking. All your fault.
2465 2018-12-18 16:41:48 Bump stocks will be illegal March 2019, just over a year of the Vegas shooting.
2466 2018-12-18 16:41:31 I see, do you play large priced stocks? Cause then 9 shares might make sense, say NFLX/TSLA?
2467 2018-12-18 16:41:19 Too many warm and fuzzy actions by the WH-ban bump stocks, dissolve Trump Foundation- cancelling govt shutdown???? A done deal! Is T getting religion? Or is he shit*ing in his pants?
2468 2018-12-18 16:41:04 Bump stocks were banned? In which chamber?!
2469 2018-12-18 16:40:54 Any moment crude oil will be below $47
Saudi's must be worried and investors in oil stocks.
2470 2018-12-18 16:40:54 Although it doesn’t hurt, banning bump stocks is just window dressing. The same thing a bump stock does can be accomplished by heavy duty rubber bands. It can also be done without ANY tools at all by anyone wearing pants. Look up “bump firing”. It’s the gun, not the accessories.
2471 2018-12-18 16:40:49 $GLD may be flat but   gold stocks in gear …..   without the metal … $AEM $KL  NEM  $GG $ABX
2472 2018-12-18 16:40:43 It's a violation of Heller but nobody really cares as bump stocks are a stupid waste of ammo. They provide no benefit to the shooter.
2473 2018-12-18 16:40:43 Banning bump stocks is a NOTHING. A zero. I'm a liberal gramma - I know how to bump fire a semi auto using the beltloop on my jeans. Don't ask me why - I think it's stupid too, but I have country raised kids so I know things.
2474 2018-12-18 16:40:41 So far today:
1) Trump org dissolved 
2) Flynn sentencing where he took full responsibility for actions
3) Trump caves to public pressure and bans bump stocks
4) Trump caves on wall

I haven't even finished my coffee

2475 2018-12-18 16:40:31 A lot of gun mods are banned people don't need bump stocks I agree with this plan 100%
2476 2018-12-18 16:40:22 Countdown to liberals saying banning bump stocks in unconstitutional.... 3...2...1...
2477 2018-12-18 16:39:55 I take it the @realDonaldTrump folks think banning bump stocks will push #MikeFlynnDayOfReckoning to secondary news status, huh? Uh, no.
2478 2018-12-18 16:39:52 You aren’t a 2nd amendment supporter if you approve of the National Firearms Act of 1934, and this insane forced ruling that bump stocks be considered machine guns, when they obviously are not. Educate yourself.
2479 2018-12-18 16:39:43 While this is a very good thing, remember that the NRA says bump stocks are useless anyway. He gets to take credit for doing something and still not anger the NRA.
2480 2018-12-18 16:39:34 Here’s what’s gonna happen. Piers is gonna ignore Trump’s criminal foundation being dissolved, praise him for banning bump stocks over a year after the Vegas massacre.
2481 2018-12-18 16:39:27 Why has the world become obsessed with pandering to “the Market”. We used to have ads on tv warning that gambling on stocks could lead to losses...they disappeared with Thatcher. Market is the root cause of all societal problems, needs to be put back in its place.
2482 2018-12-18 16:39:15 Classifying bump stocks as illegal a good and overdue move by dept of justice #sensiblegunreforms #makeamericasafer
2483 2018-12-18 16:39:13 Americans' right to use bump stocks to defend themselves from big govt tyranny is infringed by gun-grabbing socialist... [checks notes]... Donald Trump
2484 2018-12-18 16:39:11 That's because they make money when people buy stocks.  Kind of like a realtor.  they don't make money if there is no market.  That why the use their prescripted response "It's never been a better time to buy a home with rates this low".
2485 2018-12-18 16:39:08 Stocks going up up up nice 
2486 2018-12-18 16:38:55 KAP Kazatomprom closed up another high today in London up 1.95% to $14.12.  IPO was at $11.60...what a strange market with virtually all other #Uranium stocks under pressure, roll on s232 news.
2487 2018-12-18 16:38:50 Nice list of undervalued stocks!
2488 2018-12-18 16:38:43 Simply put the order does not pass Constitutional rights. That said I doubt it is challenged as bump stocks are a gimmick. 

“If Heller tells us anything, it
is that [weapons] cannot be categorically prohibited just because they are dangerous,"
2489 2018-12-18 16:38:41 Oh NO! Wealthy people trading stocks are having a bad month? When does the GoFundMe start?

The Stock Market isn't "The Economy".
2490 2018-12-18 16:38:28 US Stocks are at their worst since the Great Depression

#FuckTrump
2491 2018-12-18 16:38:19 The people who ran as #lieberals in the last election need to be punished by their constituents. Tar, feathers, whipping stocks, I could go on, but these methods are not unreasonable, in my opinion. After all, in Al-Turdhole's world, opponents would be beheaded, burned alive, etc
2492 2018-12-18 16:38:07 Between Christmas shopping and vacation planning, looks like I should took them TMO stocks out because my acct looking scarce 
2493 2018-12-18 16:38:06 But but but only outlaws will have bump stocks now.
2494 2018-12-18 16:38:03 I’m all for guns so you’re coming at the wrong guy  I’m no libtard. But I do not think Bump Stocks should be legal.
2495 2018-12-18 16:37:56 Sirji when politics gets involved with stocks don’t try to predict the markets. Crude down nifty up. Crude down thanks to trump I guess many didn’t see this coming. It has changed dynamics and similarly Modi Sahab keeping markets up here.

2512 2018-12-18 16:36:17 the trump foundation is being dissolved and dispersed to charities 
a mother is being allowed to travel to the U.S. to see her dying child
bump stocks were just banned 

um, what?
2513 2018-12-18 16:36:12 JUDGE: Mr. Flynn, how do you plead?

TRUMP: Here's my Christmas photo!

FLYNN: I plead guilty, your honor.

TRUMP: I'm banning bump stocks!

JUDGE: Are you sure of your plea?

TRUMP: We're averting the shutdown!
2514 2018-12-18 16:35:43 Children from Class 2 and Class 3 were out and about at Stocks Hall Care Home in Mawdesley today.  The children were singing a selection of Christmas songs for the residents and staff who thoroughly enjoyed the children's performance.

2516 2018-12-18 16:35:32 If you have to get long something in this bear market, be selective. Should buy only stocks with great fundamentals and should only buy great American companies! $BA, $AAPL, $DIS and not $BABA and $JD...
2517 2018-12-18 16:35:18 Easy....stocks and let's share
2518 2018-12-18 16:35:11 If guns kill people and people don't kill people how is this going to be possible because bump stocks aren't going to turn themselves in?
2519 2018-12-18 16:35:05 Bumpfire stocks are a joke, but changing the legal definition of a machine gun and thus changing the current firearm laws is not. This is the wrong way to go about this and will be challenged in court.
2520 2018-12-18 16:34:35 Harald you are incorrect,  people are selling now for tax losses , January effect anomaly happens every year. Relief rally in January! Stocks are not trading at proper fundamental levels because of the excessive selling pressure of negative YTD price action
2521 2018-12-18 16:34:19 @robertmarawa what? MAN UNITED stocks UP!
2522 2018-12-18 16:33:50 If bump stocks are machine guns that means that bump firing an ar15, for example, should also be illegal. Wording on this type of thing is pretty big.
2523 2018-12-18 16:33:46 Now watch @chuckschumer and @NancyPelosi with their minions defend bump stocks as an American freedom.
2524 2018-12-18 16:33:30 What a day for the traitor in the White House! Caves to Pelosi and the Dems after televised “negotiating” session backfires hilariously, takes bump stocks away from his base, pissing off core supporters, and his criminal “charity” gets shut down.
2525 2018-12-18 16:33:26 Thank you sir! I will buy that book
2526 2018-12-18 16:33:18 Obama never banned bump stocks. Trump is working on banning them. So much for republicans and their #2A brouhaha.
2527 2018-12-18 16:33:16 Is it an antiquated way of thinking about bear markets now though? Just raising the question. One could argue that the bear market started with the FANG stocks that quite literally, almost every fund owned some or all of these stocks.
2528 2018-12-18 16:33:13 11800 - 12500 range
Reliance, ongc, tisco, Jindal Vijay Nagar LIC housing, and chemical stocks can do well
2529 2018-12-18 16:33:08 I have so many stocks I've been in love with than seem not to reciprocate.
2530 2018-12-18 16:32:29 Trump administration moves to officially ban bump stocks that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly. (AP)
2531 2018-12-18 16:32:21 Quick!!!!! @realDonaldTrump Do something to distract from your foundation being dissolved!!! BAN THE BUMP STOCKS!!!!!
2532 2018-12-18 16:32:15 Trump admin moving to ban bump stocks. Still having the protection of the second amendment but will aid in preventing mass shootings
2533 2018-12-18 16:32:12 Trump banning bump stocks is a big mistake that's going to bite him in the ass. Hands off my rifle.
2534 2018-12-18 16:32:09 There is no sense in arguing. My hope is that everyone makes money,  including stocking. I just know that there are endless stocks in Canada,  and that if you spend your precious time bashing one, theres got to be a good reason. No one is just trying to help.
2535 2018-12-18 16:32:05 Big tobacco stocks about to rejoice.
2536 2018-12-18 16:31:39 Dow up, bump stocks going away, wall funds seem unlikely, what a day for push alerts!
2537 2018-12-18 16:31:20 I’ve been saying this for the last 2 to 3 months. The stock market has been HORRIBLE and #45 refuses to say one word about the tumbling stocks.
2538 2018-12-18 16:30:57 Loved “@cnnbrk: The Trump administration is officially banning gun "bump stocks," senior officials tell CNN. People will get 90 days to t...
2539 2018-12-18 16:30:38 Yeah they're use to the smash 4 mindset when they should realize 2 stocks finishes literally in like 2 minutes probably less.
2540 2018-12-18 16:30:27 Considering that bump stocks aren't "machine guns" I am also surprised at this.
2541 2018-12-18 16:30:25 Make we talk bout the safe and the trust fund and the stocks and bonds tho
2542 2018-12-18 16:30:24 The fact that I am a tech bug, fanatic since birth (son of engineer and pharmacist and physicist myself; build many tech stuffs) didn't stop me selling tech stocks in late 90s and gold in early 80s.
2543 2018-12-18 16:30:21 Thank you to all who submitted a comment calling on the banning of bump stocks. 

Now Congress should solidify the rule by passing a law banning bump stocks.
2544 2018-12-18 16:30:20 Spent the morning scanning in three rolls of #35mmfilm - two of #FP4+ and one of #Tmax (shot at 1600). Very mixed bag of results, Tmax loses a lot more detail than #HP5= at the same speed but is so much easier to scan.

Think I'll be sticking with Ilford stocks for the time being
2545 2018-12-18 16:30:19 MGEX deliverable stocks of spring #wheat in Duluth down another 2 mil bu this week, makes for a decline of 5 mil bu in last 3 weeks. That is 4-5x larger decline than is typical seasonally.
2546 2018-12-18 16:30:17 Imagine twisting someone's words to change the meaning of her statement. The point is the ethics rules focus on small items, while ignoring the elephants in the room. No member of Congress should have direct control of stocks. All investments should be managed.
2547 2018-12-18 16:30:04 Actually:
People who shoot and are pro 2A (not criminals, but legal gun owners), don’t like bump stocks. They’re junk.  They just waste bullets.
2548 2018-12-18 16:30:04 Gold gains on slide in dollar, stocks; focus on Fed 8/gold-markets-us-federal-reserve-china-in-focus.html?forYou=true
2549 2018-12-18 16:29:54 Finally.  Now when the criminals are shooting people with bump stocks we can yell at them and advise them that bump stocks are illegal and they are breaking the law.
2550 2018-12-18 16:29:31 In the last hour-ish: 
-Trump backing down from the Border Wall
-Trump closing Trump Foundation
-Trump admin banning bump stocks

2552 2018-12-18 16:29:03 Bump stocks are a novelty gimmick for people who don’t know how to trigger bump properly now go cry in your mommy’s basement.
2553 2018-12-18 16:28:46 Bump stocks dont kill Americans en masse. Semi automatic assault rifles do.
2554 2018-12-18 16:28:42 I’m very pro 2A,
But bump stocks are absolute junk. Anyone who actually shoots guns doesn’t use them. They kill accuracy and are useless. This was a fight over something no one wanted anyway.
2555 2018-12-18 16:28:41 Stocks hit a new low for 2018
This is shaping up to be Wall Street’s worst year since the financial crisis a decade ago, with the S&P 500 down 4.8 percent since January.

#TrumpEconomy
2556 2018-12-18 16:28:41 I second this. I shoot for sport but never saw the need for bump stocks. Unfortunately, as with all laws, only law abiding citizens are impacted by this.
2557 2018-12-18 16:28:40 @DonaldJTrumpJr #GunControl Banning bump stocks will hurt Pres. Trump's base... they are just gimmicks and are an infringement. No compromise on gun control, ever.
2558 2018-12-18 16:28:32 You can build your own bump stocks!
2559 2018-12-18 16:28:25 “Outweighs the needs of special interests.” What a preposterous statement. Majority of tax cuts went to wealthy & corporations, aka “the special interests”. The avg American saved $1600. Corps/rich saved MILLIONS. Oh & the deficit, stocks , eco. slowing. No wonder U jumped ship
2560 2018-12-18 16:28:19 RT @CNN: The Trump administration is officially banning bump stocks. Under a new federal rule, those who possess the devices will get 90 days to turn them in from the date that the final rule is published in the federal register.

Good luck with that!
2561 2018-12-18 16:28:16 bump stocks ... are not commonly used in crime
2562 2018-12-18 16:28:08 First the bump stocks, then the guns, then it's gender transfers and abortions for everybody!
2563 2018-12-18 16:28:05 Parliament is not allowed to discuss or vote, while the country is being shaken down by streetcorner appliance mobsters. Has anyone looked to see if any of the Tories own fridge stocks?
2564 2018-12-18 16:28:05 Can all ways trust the editorals to give relible tips on stocks. Commen sense gets you a lot farther then meaningless numbers!
2565 2018-12-18 16:28:04 They are closing the gap.  10 yr note now at 2.825%. If we close down today at a new 52wk low that will be amazingly bearish. #Trading #stocks #Futures $TLT $ZN $TNX $ZB $TYX $NQ $NQ_F $ES $ES_F

2567 2018-12-18 16:27:57 @NRA  Hahahahaha! Do you wish you could have all that money back that the Kremlin gave you to elect @realDonaldTrump ?    You can't use bump stocks to defend yourself at 400 rounds per minute anymore.  90 days to turn them in, or else you are a criminal.   You've been infringed!

2571 2018-12-18 16:27:44 And it does not affect me nor millions of other gun owners who see bump stocks as a toy which reduces accuracy and control.
2572 2018-12-18 16:27:20 If that were true, why do people buy bump stocks?  Marketing?
2573 2018-12-18 16:27:18 But I only want to buy stocks when there going up

2576 2018-12-18 16:26:47 So are Chuck & Nancy now going to become fans of bump stocks?
2577 2018-12-18 16:26:45 Rump banning Bump Stocks is not something I expected to read this morning
2578 2018-12-18 16:26:44 Why is SpaceX stocks private 
2579 2018-12-18 16:26:44 Stocks look likely to repeat 2008 and all Cryptos are on mega sale
2580 2018-12-18 16:26:29 Also, lots of us newly retired need to keep a certain part of our retirement accounts in stocks for the (still) long haul. Over the years, I expect corrections, but this drop is mostly trump-inflicted. At a time when we are not adding to our accounts, but withdrawing, it hurts.
2581 2018-12-18 16:26:21 The consequences started the minute he took office.
People have literally died. 
We knew the stocks would eventually tank thanks to GOP garbage.

We have no leaders.
2582 2018-12-18 16:26:10 Are bump stocks registered?

2584 2018-12-18 16:25:59 I own over 50 firearms. Zero bump stocks. Ignorance is bliss
2585 2018-12-18 16:25:56 @realDonaldTrump #GunControl Banning Bump stocks will hurt you base... they are a gimmick and nothing more. No compromise on guns ever, it is more infringement and nothing more
2586 2018-12-18 16:25:42 Yes John!!! Can smell the fear in the venture exchange for sure, area of strong value here! Rotation will start in 2019 out of high growth bullshit stocks to value ..... That will be the theme of 2019
2587 2018-12-18 16:25:40 But does understand how to set up the vote.   You’re a bunch of laughing stocks
2588 2018-12-18 16:25:38 The Trump administration is moving to officially ban bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms.
2589 2018-12-18 16:25:37 Money beginning to move into bonds and gold in the last few minutes and out of stocks.
2590 2018-12-18 16:25:35 But then only the criminals will have bump stocks? How will I defend my family. 
Breakfast convo at the @DLoesch house!
2591 2018-12-18 16:25:33 right, it's a weird concept, not about bump stocks themselves. bump stock bans have ... weird interpretations based on how they're written (see MD)
2592 2018-12-18 16:25:33 Trump moves to ban bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms. 

Whatever said and done, this is something we can ALL get behind! We need to applaud the move.
2593 2018-12-18 16:25:21 Bump Stocks are getting banned. Well done DJT
2594 2018-12-18 16:25:12 If nothing else comes from this administration we can say we got a ban on bump stocks. 90 days to turn yours in, yo!! #GunControl #finally
2595 2018-12-18 16:24:50 $1.5 trillion is on par with annual Federal debt growth during the Obama years. It's not Trump's (only barely different) fiscal policy that's crashing stocks. It's the Fed raising rates. It kept them low, and printed money, during all 8 Obama years. That's why stocks always rose.
2596 2018-12-18 16:24:41 Pending Goverment Shutdown , 7 current criminal investigations, Tariffs slowing growth ..... Oh wait , let’s ban bump stocks
2597 2018-12-18 16:24:34 I'm sure he thinks that "bump stocks" are shares in an exotic dancer corporation.
2598 2018-12-18 16:23:53 BNF is volatile as it is lop sided index with HDFC Bank having more than 35% weightage. Nifty is bit different though. Will not be easy to manipulate index of 50 stocks.
2599 2018-12-18 16:23:47 Glad they are banning bump stocks...finally something good from this admin. Doesn't change his status from an orange turd though.
2600 2018-12-18 16:23:38 Global slowdown / there isn't one. It's always correlated with stocks for some stupid reason. Always a deal when it happens.
2601 2018-12-18 16:23:36 I don’t think most people care too much about bump stocks. 

I’ve fired one before, it’s a cool little novelty but completely stupid/inaccurate at the end of the day
2602 2018-12-18 16:23:35 Woke up to see trump foundation agreeing to dissolve, Flynn to be sentenced soon, Trump backing down on the wall and bump stocks possibly being banned 

#SoMuchWinning
2603 2018-12-18 16:23:06 imagine thinking banning bump stocks will lower the gun crime rate lolol
2604 2018-12-18 16:22:58 Not necessary. Most nations maintain enough FOL stocks to tide over emergencies like this. Surely China also does.

But contd blockade can cause anxieties. Hence the CPEC
2605 2018-12-18 16:22:51 Media suddenly supports bump.stocks
2606 2018-12-18 16:22:40 It's already a big day between Stone, Flynn, and the Trump Foundation. 

Don't let bump stocks and wall funding clutter as they designed it to.
2607 2018-12-18 16:22:24 I just read he’s backing down on the wall, banning bump stocks and dissolving his foundation. Feeling a little pressure maybe?
2608 2018-12-18 16:22:22 @realDonaldTrump 
Please do NOT ban Bump stocks for rifles.
This is a strategy by the enemy to strangle us law abiding Americans.
It's not a need thing
It is a want thing
In America if you can afford it and want it, it's not going to hurt you or others so be it. Dont ban Bumps!
2609 2018-12-18 16:22:05 Lol you always could but it sends you so far and you start to fall that most characters can't recover it.... I mean don't mash, just give me my free stocks

Ban on bump stocks
2614 2018-12-18 16:20:37 mstradingcoach, thanks for following me! DM me for collaboration or discussion on technology,  stocks or options.
2615 2018-12-18 16:20:35 Like anything out of the Trump Administration, what is REALLY going on? I just can’t trust what they say on its face.

If completely true, they are banning bump stocks, then I say thank you.
2616 2018-12-18 16:20:27 RIP bump-stocks

2620 2018-12-18 16:19:56 Well, since bump stocks can be 3-D printed, and no one is going to voluntarily turn over anything, this is just a ruse. Call me when the FBI starts raiding gun ranges to collect them.
2621 2018-12-18 16:19:27 Pursuing politics has always been easier for a person of means. Who can afford to take time off to campaign? As such it makes sense that a person in politics will have stocks. This is a sticky wicket-gov can’t demand someone sell their stocks to take a job.
2622 2018-12-18 16:19:08 BREAKING: The Trump administration moves to ban gun bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms.  - @AP

2624 2018-12-18 16:18:49 (AP) Trump administration moves officially to ban bump stocks, which let semi-automatic weapons fire rapidly.
2625 2018-12-18 16:18:49 Lol, meanwhile in real news today:
- Trump Foundation shut down by DoJ
- Bump stocks banned
2626 2018-12-18 16:18:33 But Walter he's also banning bump stocks? Didn't the Bible say those are a human right! Wow!!
2627 2018-12-18 16:18:29 His base won't leave him. Most don't own bump stocks, anyway. They can still get almost every type of firearm they want.
2628 2018-12-18 16:18:23 #Trump Trump resignation ahead? With walls closing in and kids apparently in imminent jeopardy of indictment, case for resignation increasingly compelling for Trump, we think.   This possibility/prospect NOT PRICED into either equity or bond market.

2633 2018-12-18 16:17:56 Ahh .. so you got nothing, Obama messed with the healthcare and Trump has had ample time to come up w/ a replacement  but he hasnt done it , As far as the drops of the stocks and the rise in interest rates .. he owns both .
2634 2018-12-18 16:17:53 See that long line over there? No? Hmmmm, well, if there were a line there it would be the line of criminals handing in their banned bump stocks. Remember, Mr. Respecter of the #2A , the long term goal is confiscation.
>10 round mags banned in NJ. Common sense gun laws, right?
2635 2018-12-18 16:17:33 Headline berita semuanya tentang Manchester United & Jose Mourinho.

Good job, Woodward. Your move makes Manchester United becomes headline and raise stocks value. Darn. 

That’s what football all about recently, BUSINESS. 
2636 2018-12-18 16:17:14 Bold move by #ManchesterUnited at least $MANU stocks are on the rise. Hoping a great manager arrives at Old Trafford!
2637 2018-12-18 16:17:14 Koolaid? How about reality. If your paycheck is down, that’s on you pal. NK is better. Isis better. Facts. Not debatable. Stocks up and down, but still way up over 2016. Actually now is a great time to invest. Will explode when China negotiations done.
2638 2018-12-18 16:17:13 Only the 1% Trump supporters care about the stock market.

The trailer park Trumpers don’t have jackshit (or shit for brains).

I have stocks, but I’m willing to let them fall 20% if it rids us of Trump.  

Good buying opportunity and stocks will come back after he’s gone.
2639 2018-12-18 16:17:12 PMs buying stocks and puts at the same time?

2642 2018-12-18 16:16:20 Les bump stocks qui permettaient de transformer des fusils semi-automatiques en fusils automatiques officiellement interdits par l’administration Trump. C’est ce système qu’avait utilisé le tueur de Las Vegas (oct 2017).Petite victoire pour défenseurs d’un + grand contrôle armes.
2643 2018-12-18 16:15:43 There is nothing "sensible" about classifying bump stocks as NFA items. Nothing legal either as they don't meet statutory definition of full auto.
2644 2018-12-18 16:15:28 Nice thread!

does this step include investing in low carbon impact stocks/funds? That is another bigimpacto.

LOLOLOLOLOOLO
2646 2018-12-18 16:15:17 The Trump administration is today moving to ban bump stocks. Of course you won’t hear that on CNN or NBC. With everything going on the the trump admin is still working to make us safer, with zero credit from the hypocritical left!
2647 2018-12-18 16:15:09 WOW.

1. Banning bump stocks (federal rule)
2. Trump Foundation agrees to dissolve under court supervision
3. No shutdown over wall funding
4. Flynn is now in a federal courtroom for his sentencing hearing

It's not even noon!
2648 2018-12-18 16:14:58 Stock market is still up 17% in just two short years that Trump has been in office. And THAT’s with a trade war going on.....that we’ll win. American companies, balance sheets, unemployment rates, deregulation, lower taxes, are all awesome. Great time to BUY stocks!
2649 2018-12-18 16:14:53 It seems you have purchased all the stocks in index :) . Don't worry I will get back to you soon.
2650 2018-12-18 16:14:49 All you had to do was buy and hold some diverse stocks. Like, that should be the vampire system. The ultimate mutual fund.

2652 2018-12-18 16:14:40 So whats the stretch..arent the companies buying back their stock and arent the stocks fallen
2653 2018-12-18 16:14:40 Waiting for the @NRA and their more rabid minions to get all fiery over 45’s proposal to ban bump stocks... cause you’know, hunters need them....
2654 2018-12-18 16:14:29 Is there a penalty for NOT destroying/turning in bump stocks? 'Cause that would make the ban actually effective. If we have any idea in the first place who purchases and owns bump stocks, that is.

2659 2018-12-18 16:13:40 Stocks are oversold at this level, and since it deals in buyers and sellers, the fact that everything is sold and we are at about where it ended last year means the real starting average is much higher once the gains are recovered by normal buying.
2660 2018-12-18 16:13:37 Lol

On the same day:

1. Trump admin bans bump stocks
2. Backs down over shutdown

Emotion over facts again. While it was a contributor in las vegas, bump stocks are NOT the only (or even the first) way to do that technique, it'll make us 'feel good' but will actually not do what they think.

Don't get me wrong, banning bump stocks is a good thing. But... distraction is the 'go to' in this administration.

2685 2018-12-18 16:09:43 And that, my gun fetishist friends, is how laws work. No one from the Deep State will be coming to your door to take your bump stocks; you have 90 days to get rid of them or you're in violation of the law.

It's not even Friday yet.
2691 2018-12-18 16:09:22 To draw the base's attention away from Trump's illegal activity, they've announced they'll take bump stocks away immediately. Turn in your guns, #MAGA.

2698 2018-12-18 16:08:35 I'd like to see stocks reimplemented as punishment for the Flynns (both of whom are the lowest form of scum) - no jailtime, just 10 days of being locked up, bare-ass naked in front of the Washington monument by their wire-thin wrists and necks, to be degraded on a 24-hour basis.
2699 2018-12-18 16:08:28 The Trump administration just banned bump stocks and will also require gun owners that have them to turn them in! Bump stocks where used in the Las Vegas shooting. Credit where it’s due.  #GunControl #CommonSense

2717 2018-12-18 16:06:34 Well the thing is that this reclassification of bump stocks relies on a reinterpretation of the existing definition of what is "semi-automatic," which is itself defined by statute. Even the ATF wasn't actually sure if they could do this outside Congress.

2720 2018-12-18 16:05:37 How likely will the manufacturers change one small element of the design to avoid the definition of “bump stocks” and remarket under a different name? We should understand the administrations definition of what constitutes a bump stock
2721 2018-12-18 16:05:26 @realDonaldTrump you should save this tweet. You have never before, and probably will never again see this on my feed. 
Thank you, Donald Trump. 
Thank you for your action in banning bump-stocks. This move by your administration will save lives across our nation. Where were we..?

2725 2018-12-18 16:04:50 Getting stock direction right (regularly) is next to impossible. Consequently, day trading stocks, or trading outright futures has horrible "odds" of success. Similarly trading options directionally is difficult, often death by a thousand cuts.....

2733 2018-12-18 16:03:02 Bump stocks sounds to me like trying to distract from Flynn today.  The Wall was done because he can’t go to Mar-A-Lago for 18 days if he shuts down the govt.
2734 2018-12-18 16:02:55 Who would have thought?

Trump administration bans bump stocks

Illegal to make or sell

If you have these, limited time to turn in

Probably a distraction ploy, but still good news

2736 2018-12-18 16:02:52 It will really be a double whammy on the middle and upper middle class when they do their taxes in six weeks and find out the tax cut for them just meant that the IRS took too little during the year and now they owe. They will have to liquidate stocks and lose more.
2737 2018-12-18 16:02:29 @RWPUSA has some great observations on this. A few discussions with him could be a big help. 

I couldn't trade stocks working at a bank for SEC fears, but Congress can.
2738 2018-12-18 16:02:22 Credit where credit's due. Good on the Trump Administration for Banning bump stocks. Took them forever. But at least it got done...

Also reserve the right to continue to call them soulless assholes once they undo this, which they prob will do.
2739 2018-12-18 16:02:14 BREAKING - the justice department has amended ATF regulations to clarify that bump stocks are “machine guns” and thus are illegal; people who possess them have 90 days to turn them in from date rule is published as final in federal register, which is sometime this week
2740 2018-12-18 16:02:03 merci pour les réfs !!! jvais aller refaire mes stocks
2741 2018-12-18 16:02:00 JUST IN: Trump admin banning bump stocks. 
Weird, I thought the dems and Obama were supposed to be the ones taking away our guns/gun rights
2742 2018-12-18 16:01:58 So awesome. And here big corporations are taking away bonuses and stocks.
2743 2018-12-18 16:01:50 Maybe the banning of bump stocks is part of a trade-off to get more money for the border wall and therefore keep the government from shutting down?
2744 2018-12-18 16:01:31 Bump stocks have been banned
2745 2018-12-18 16:01:26 @PoppyHarlowCNN do you realize your an asshole   He bans bump stocks and instead of giving credit you find fault.  Just a compete ass!!!!
2746 2018-12-18 16:01:25 TRUMP ADMIN BANNING BUMP STOCKS !!! 90 day turn on previously sold
2747 2018-12-18 16:01:24 #BREAKING - The Trump Administration has BANNED Bump Stocks! All must be turned in within 90 days of the rule going into affect!
2748 2018-12-18 16:01:13 Trump just banned Bump stocks, must be trying to distract us.
2749 2018-12-18 16:01:09 Nothing hitting the scanners. #Stocks #investing
2750 2018-12-18 16:01:06 @realDonaldTrump good job on actually doing something that the @NRA does not like. Give credit when credit is due. Banning Bump Stocks is a good thing.
2751 2018-12-18 16:00:59 They FINALLY banned bump stocks... sheesh.

They didn't just ban the sales of them, but they're giving bump stock owners a window to turn them in.
2752 2018-12-18 16:00:48 BUMP STOCKS BANNED! 
2753 2018-12-18 16:00:44 @realDonaldTrump just banned (finally!!) Bump Stocks. Poor @DLoesch's panties are most definitely in a bunch. I LOVE IT!!
2754 2018-12-18 16:00:43 Last 30 minutes: Trump admin bans bump stocks, Martha McSally appointed to Senate, Trump Foundation to dissolve. Still TK: Flynn sentencing
2755 2018-12-18 16:00:40 It's 11AM and the Trump admin just released a bunch of announcements meant to dwarf the Flynn sentencing:
- Back down on budget
- Ban bump stocks
- End Trump's Foundation
2756 2018-12-18 16:00:39 At least one good thing comes from this awful administration. Bump stocks are being banned and owners must turn them in. #TuesdayThoughts
2757 2018-12-18 16:00:39 So ... they're building the border wall out of bump stocks, then. Good plan.
2758 2018-12-18 16:00:28 Stocks in the town square. I’ve been dreaming of smashing something in his unsightly face
2759 2018-12-18 16:00:26 Driven by corporate greed. GREED hurts all people around the world. Time for the market to correct itself. Over valued stocks , over valued oil , gas.and over paid corporate CEO's.

2761 2018-12-18 16:00:24 White House news today is interesting.  Bump stocks, no wall, and press briefing.

This is what Blue Wave winning looks like.
2762 2018-12-18 16:00:22 #BREAKING: Trump administration bans bump stocks in guns and will require gun-owners that have them to turn them in. Bump stocks where used in horrific Nevada concert shooting
2763 2018-12-18 15:59:53 Trump bans bump stocks! They want you defenseless
2764 2018-12-18 15:59:51 Tell the banks. Your office does have control of the Treasury. When stocks tank and the economy slows, it’s the response of bankers that sends the nation into recession.
2765 2018-12-18 15:59:44 BTW, thats really good info you shared. There are a number of stocks in that bucket that have been overly punished. Its just digging thru & figuring out the ones are potential good investments & not value traps. FWIW, I lean to the good side w/ SCHW, which is why I had that chart

2767 2018-12-18 15:59:38 While I trust your competence as a journalist and am very pleased to hear about this positive action—if anything ever sounded like #FakeNews, I’d have to say the Trump Admin banning bump stocks is it. 

Glad it’s not!

2770 2018-12-18 15:58:50 Oh I'm just sure all those rabid 2A folks will meekly turn in their bump stocks.

2774 2018-12-18 15:57:38 I am going to do a thread on the economy touching on informal economy. I had not visited the area called "tuckshops" in a while, I was shocked, the area is buisy, many people there trading. Lorries delivering stocks, small trucks and cars, carts carrying away commodities......
2775 2018-12-18 15:57:24 In the past, like, 5 mins:

2867 2018-12-18 15:29:53 While we note the upward move (bounce?) in stocks, the continued bid for Treasuries $TLT, Gold $GLD, and Yen $FXY (places to hide) don't exactly give us a bullish warm and fuzzy feeling (aka evidence for the bullish case)

2870 2018-12-18 15:29:07 Hedge funds buying the same stocks is awesome until there are fewer buyers for the same basket of funds. In doing this, they've inflated prices, created real wealth for some, and paper wealth for most. Maybe the market is correcting but maybe we'll be standing in bread lines. 
2871 2018-12-18 15:28:56 Government fiscal policy will have an impact on stocks and business.
2872 2018-12-18 15:28:40 Technology stocks have plunged in recent months and maybe for good reason.
Goldman Sachs told its clients the firm’s latest survey of 100 corporate technology buyers revealed spending plans have deteriorated to the worst level in four years.
2873 2018-12-18 15:27:50 wonder what he thought about stocks at 3 sigma at the highs
2874 2018-12-18 15:27:38 Really? Because I remember the last time the stocks started crashing under Bush Americans started losing 700,000 jobs a week. It’s hardly no big deal.
2875 2018-12-18 15:27:18 Today’s headline:  Stocks Having Worst December Since Great Depression. @realDonaldTrump how’s all that winning going?  Are you tired of all that winning yet?  #MAGA
2876 2018-12-18 15:26:38 @HallieJackson Don’t worry about stocks having the worst Dec. since 1931. This is just Trump’s idea of the good old days.
2877 2018-12-18 15:26:37 I have a suspicion they will pause and stocks will rally big but who knows.
2878 2018-12-18 15:26:36 @bmstores why advertise something as being in stock yet so far I am yet to find a store that stocks it. Disgusted that nobody can be bothered to reply to my previous messages. #lumierecandlestik.
2879 2018-12-18 15:26:34 Sir What is easy for trading
Nifty or Bank Nifty Or Stocks
2880 2018-12-18 15:26:04 Scary that THIS December is on track to be the worst for stocks since (gulp) 1931. The Great Depression is no longer a black & white movie, it's alive in Technicolor right before our eyes. Hold on tight, it's gonna feel like the end of Thelma and Louise. 
2881 2018-12-18 15:25:56 WTIC Charts looking weak. Can it go toward USD 40/35 ? Chance is there , but only after some upsides/ranging over next few weeks to catch further retail into making "value buys " in Oil stocks.
CRB Index should hold 183 and should not crack below,if it does that WTIC in trouble
2882 2018-12-18 15:25:42 So some in the #2A community shrugged off the bump stocks... are you going to shrug off magazines too? 

It’s time to redraw the line.

2884 2018-12-18 15:25:17 As of yesterday, 18% of stocks on the NYSE were < 200-DMA.  Lowest since the beginning of 2016, which was at 16.
2885 2018-12-18 15:25:13 No need to be afraid, using the fear is what the big picture leader does, to catch massive gains in the key stocks.
2886 2018-12-18 15:25:01 A good year to buy stocks. Bad year to cash out.

2889 2018-12-18 15:24:41 I don't know much about stocks. The market causing me problems is the grocery market. Paying 20 cents to a dollar more on necessities weekly. On my budget bringing less home.

2894 2018-12-18 15:23:22 Surprised?  Both $CURA & $ACGR took the money and left the institutional shareholder base (suckers that got $11.45 shares in $CURA & $25 shares in $ACGR) out to dry.  @CanaccorGenuity just put out $13 & $35 price targets & stocks are going in wrong direction.  @AcreageCannabis
2895 2018-12-18 15:23:19 Owners of bump stocks have 90 days to destroy/turn them in to the ATF.  Owners also can contact local law enforcement offices to see if they would be willing to accept the devices.

Why?

Bump stocks aren't alcohol, tobacco, firearms OR explosive.

#NRA #TheRealDonaldTrump #MAGA

2897 2018-12-18 15:23:08 Is it starting to sink in yet that we are leaving & there is nothing you could have done to stop other than agree a mutually beneficial leaving plan?

You instead used #BREXIT as the ‘village stocks’ to warn off others and punish the UK.

So far you appear to have failed at both.
2898 2018-12-18 15:23:08 Mostly down to how much better off we'll be without him in the long run tho, stocks suffered massively with the shit season plus the whole market being in the toilet, it's down from 27
2899 2018-12-18 15:22:48 Hi, funny enough but it is true .A TV program called "millionaire trader" on BBC2 showed that best performers during the worst part of financial crisis were in alcohol stocks and tobacco
2900 2018-12-18 15:22:46 word is that if you get a follow by @LILBTHEBASEDGOD in 2018, your stocks will go up!
2901 2018-12-18 15:21:49 How many times did you go on and on about how great you are when stocks were high!???  If was on you then, it’s on you now! 
2902 2018-12-18 15:21:29 I woke up, realized I was late for work (it's the job where I don't have a set schedule I just wanted to be there oh idk AN HOUR AGO) and decided to cuddle my dog as I contemplated selling my stocks which I still need to do

2904 2018-12-18 15:21:22 He didn't pay for the 1st wedding. He lied about it saying he sold his Facebook stocks to pay for it. The wedding was in 2011 and Facebook went public on 2012.
The man is a compulsive liar. I really don't believe anything he says at this stage.
2905 2018-12-18 15:20:40 I love stocks. What we buying?
2906 2018-12-18 15:20:35 This is trump’s deplorable, racist, Nationalist being praised by Pence for making America “white again”! Trump’s America is crumbling like an earthquake, and we’re all losing healthcare, stocks, interest rate, pollution, etc., and our standing in the world is diminishing daily!!
2907 2018-12-18 15:20:31 .@realDonaldTrump How is it that when the stock markets are up, you take complete credit. But, when stocks go down it is not your fault. This has been the worst December since the recession. You are the worst in the W.H. EVER!
2908 2018-12-18 15:20:18 You Are The biggest indicator for $WKHS stock trend, whenever you entered a mention, your stocks decreased .
2909 2018-12-18 15:20:07 Played like absolute trash today, even in the ones that I've won it doesn't feel convincing. Got bodied hard by King K Rool. lazy recoveries that led to losing stocks early, becoming too reliant on HAs for damage, too predictable with rolls. 
I gotta be better.

2913 2018-12-18 15:19:00 Need to make mid evil stocks. 

 I plan on using them on the next weather person to utter polar vortex
2914 2018-12-18 15:18:43 Not a big fan of commodities. If we head toward a recession like the inverted yield indicated demand for oil could weaken. Still like looking for stocks with big shorts on them
2915 2018-12-18 15:18:07 The stock market is up YTD... and the graphic is a 3 DAY chart anyone who has ever looked at stocks before knows to look at a larger sample than 3 days 
2916 2018-12-18 15:17:44 U.S. stocks climbed Tuesday morning, putting at least a temporary halt to the steep market losses that circled the globe in prior days. Asian markets sank sharply earlier in the day, but European markets were mixed.
2917 2018-12-18 15:17:08 This man should have a very old fashioned punishment for the nonsense he’s been pedalling ! Stocks maybe ?
2918 2018-12-18 15:17:06 It probably means you got your stocks and equity taken away to cover your "raise"

2921 2018-12-18 15:16:51 As a general rule, when people you know who have nothing to do with stocks & trading start providing unsolicited advice, start thinking the top might be in soon
2922 2018-12-18 15:16:26 This is going to cost Trump a lot of voters.
Can't we at least trade bump stocks for suppressors?
2923 2018-12-18 15:16:19 ça laisse tomber les pennys stocks ? :O
2924 2018-12-18 15:16:05 Also if you know anything about stocks you’d know $15,000 for one bitcoin is over priced and the currency can be easily manipulated but it’s kinda like the dot com bubble or the real estate bubble even after It burst you can still come up on top
2925 2018-12-18 15:16:01 What’s interesting is that we’re seeing the ripple effects of investors grouping tech stocks into one basket which makes zero sense - why should the price of IBM a B2B cloud computing/infrastructure provider correlate with Etsy or Facebook
2926 2018-12-18 15:15:21 Another day, another president tweet hurting more stocks. Get off Twitter if you hate it so much! Good thing you had Russia in your corner helping you out.

2933 2018-12-18 15:14:41 @Bearishlong @Eldoctoro to say zero is an overstatement it will effect some but people thinking all pot stocks will go up 300 is incorrect

2960 2018-12-18 15:06:41 #stocks The intense pressure on the FED not to follow through on its longstanding promise to hike rates this month is only partly the search for a fall guy.  There is a fatal contradiction between treating a symptom and thinking it is a cure.  A cure is a cure, and it can hurt.
2961 2018-12-18 15:05:49 People:do not freak out about the stock market. Unless you’re selling naked puts or your over leveraged, this is a blip on the radar. If anything, buy stocks that are now on sale! #StockMarket #staycalm

2969 2018-12-18 15:03:37 You can end that by simply telling everyone about the " good stocks " that MAY be coming out from favorable legislation.

2971 2018-12-18 15:03:17 I can’t speak for these investors but there are a few reasons to be long. (1) belief that technology will change the economic picture (2) potential consolidation by the majors (3) the idea that these stocks trade in line with oil prices, so being long is a bet on rising prices.

2976 2018-12-18 15:02:11 Then your learn about ETF’s. Which I recommend. It’s a group of stocks in a particular field. Like Social Media  covers Twitter, FB, Snap. As a whole instead of individually. Meaning less risk.
2977 2018-12-18 15:02:03 I wish I had the time to quick trade stocks
2978 2018-12-18 15:02:02 not good or bad really. just saying that for the first time in 10 years, there is a very small negative correlation. i'm somewhat making fun of the idea that when stocks go down, commodities go up. its never that simple.

2993 2018-12-18 14:58:50 Let me add here .. I never trust Futures charts. Go by Spot/Cash Charts for any decision purely becoz at times low volume in stocks n whipsaws in futures but the same doesn't happen easily in cash/spot

2996 2018-12-18 14:58:25 Have some thoughts brewing about ovepriced stocks and the risk of buying-in at high premiums. In transit, soon talk.
2997 2018-12-18 14:57:59 Thanks for exploding the deficit and helping corporations buy back stocks. #betteroffnow

3000 2018-12-18 14:56:51 If you are not into stocks or investing as a wholeplease don’t refer me or try to debate me cuz I will not hesitate to embarrass you. It’s one of my biggest pet peeves
3001 2018-12-18 14:56:42 För svårt att tajma marknaden. Lika bra att vara all-in så länge man är på ”the buy side of life” som @Investeraren  brukar säga  som sagt 100 % stocks och månadsspar!
3002 2018-12-18 14:56:13 Could be true. You would think all the warnings about stocks are indicating a huge recession. Certainly the quantity of money printing since 2000 has to lead us to a terrible situation.
3003 2018-12-18 14:55:29 Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are on pace for their worst December performance since 1931, when stocks were battered during the Great Depression. The Dow and S&P 500 are down 7.8 percent and 7.6 percent this month, respectively.

3005 2018-12-18 14:55:00 Nice little rally from SPY but you can see it in big board stocks, cautious climbs as you know everyone has there finger on the sell button just ready to panic ABORT the second this turns downward.  Which I suspect happens around 260 SPY
3006 2018-12-18 14:54:39 One way to comprehend ETFs is to treat them as mutual funds but trade them like stocks.

3008 2018-12-18 14:54:21 Stocks are forward indicators. Investors are betting things get worse, under Democrat controlled House. Same thing happened in 2008; Democrat win led to market sell-off, and near depression.

3010 2018-12-18 14:53:46 The Great Depression talk this morning is nice and all, but the big test will be 250s $SPY. Either we bounce there, hold and test highs or we start going into scary hours #stocks
3011 2018-12-18 14:53:43 I think:

1) Fed tightens tomorrow
2) Gives some comfort that hikes will slow (e.g. dots from 3 to 2 hikes)
3) Does not address QT

Overall, gut says this MIGHT be enough for a very short-term equity rally (1-3d).  I'd still bet we go lower in stocks.

3016 2018-12-18 14:52:32 The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks officially fell into a bear market on Monday, dropping more than 20% from its Aug. 31 peak. The slump ended a bull run stretching back to April 2016.
3017 2018-12-18 14:52:12 We are seeing it in the stock market now. The ONLY thing I’m ok with right now is that I’m still young enough to have a 1/4 century left in my 401k before retirement, so as long as it bounces back eventually, all my current $ for the next several years will buy stocks cheaper.
3018 2018-12-18 14:52:10 About 880 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange posted 52-week lows on Monday, the highest total since Jan. 20, 2016, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Roughly 740 stocks on the Nasdaq notched 52-week lows, also the biggest figure in nearly three years.

3028 2018-12-18 14:50:34 DRIP vs no Drip. My philosophy is simple. Do you want more of that stock? Is it at a price you would want to buy  shares? Or do you want some cash? (To either invest elsewhere or sit on in case the stock market corrects) #dividend #stocks

3083 2018-12-18 14:34:21 Not an economic analyst, but correct me if I am wrong. The tax cuts were essentially the nation's wealth. Corps invested those tax cuts in the stock market with buybacks. Now that the  stocks are worth less that before the buybacks, that wealth is gone. Yet the deficit remains.

3114 2018-12-18 14:25:12 And I think you're right. I can't account for the V dip. I sold out of V stocks in October. Looking to buy back into WUV here soon though
3115 2018-12-18 14:24:42 I legit quit s4 for a year after she came out.  People with literally no smash skill, background or fundamentals could learn her bread and butter BS and shred stocks.

3118 2018-12-18 14:24:14 AOC: This blows my mind: House Ethics Rules prevent me from receiving a $100 gift card, or crashing at a place as I wait for rent $, but somehow allow members w/ investment portfolios to write laws that will personally enrich them $1000s in their own stocks; potentially millions.
3119 2018-12-18 14:24:01 I am buying stocks right now. Others sell, I buy. As long as Capitalism survives life for those who love it and hate it will be good.
3120 2018-12-18 14:23:42 Hard to believe Suntrust from $18 to $12 is reason when stock less than half the target; when funds liquidate, stocks suffer disproportionately seems more likely. $ADAP
3121 2018-12-18 14:23:36 Haven't looked at the data but ruling ACA as unconsitutional should of caused an up turn in Big pharma stocks but your definetly right about China and the fed. If everyone was smart everyone would of had IRON HANDS.

3127 2018-12-18 14:22:40 By "do something" you mean write an encouraging note suggesting people picture their future selves having held stocks through the ups and downs and living the dream. Of course, the note writing process itself is also cathartic for you personally. Win-win! Unless it's 1929 2.0.

3132 2018-12-18 14:19:10 Stocks on track for worst December since the Great Depression (1931!). But I thought the tax cuts were going to pay for themselves, & companies would pay their employees. Not massive layoffs (VZ) or stock buybacks (JNJ).  #TaxScam #WeNeedGreenNewDeal
3133 2018-12-18 14:19:04 It's called MMs and a cesspit of corruption, around 5 or 6 years back it was not like this, can't wait to get out of AIM only 2 stocks left and then I am out.

3135 2018-12-18 14:18:48 I don’t see the issue with this. However I will invest heavily in bubble wrap stocks as it’s apparent a lot of adults still need to be wrapped in it to survive

3149 2018-12-18 14:12:03 Sure, that’s a fair statement. But stocks (or a particular company) performed X% over the last Y years so they will perform X% over the next Z years is totally false

- Mexico didn't pay for the wall.

- Out of control tariff war.

- Exploding deficits.

- We are aligned with Russia/Saudi on climate issues.

- GM plants closing/stocks sputtering.

- North Korea threat remains.

- And you pay tRump for his green fees.
3153 2018-12-18 14:09:08 When I worked at the Fed Res Bank of NY, we were prohibited from owning bank stocks. We were also prohibited from trading interest rate instruments around the time monetary policy discussions were going on. Seems reasonable to prohibit Congress from individual stock ownership.
3154 2018-12-18 14:08:25 Stocks plunge another 507 points.

3161 2018-12-18 14:05:32 The economy was already in freefall as Obama inherited the recession from Bush. But under Obama, the recession ended, was vastly improved by time Trump took office. Under Obama. Stocks rose from under 7,000 to almost 20,000. Unemployment from 10% to 4.7%.

3164 2018-12-18 14:05:12 Don’t short in the hole.
Don’t forget that the market goes up and down not up or down.
Use the snapback rallies to trim if you think that we are going lower.

3166 2018-12-18 14:04:30 Morning Market Update: stocks look to rebound after steep selloff.
3167 2018-12-18 14:03:59 Was there last week . stocks were depleted. But worth a shot
3168 2018-12-18 14:03:53 Raoul, we agree on bonds but disagree on stocks. I see GOOGL at least 50% higher from here in coming months. Sentiment at bearish extremes & equity market setting up for a parabolic melt-up. S&P to 3500, maybe higher. Fed's about to blink.
3169 2018-12-18 14:03:53 I'd tend to agree with u CryptoQF, but his argument is almost so basic it holds water. i.e Stocks outperform bonds over any 15yr period, etc.
3170 2018-12-18 14:03:07 But for Uranium late Q4 is normally a slow season for U since utility budgets are spent.  Q1 normally brings new life to the sector.  This yr we held up pretty well.  Last yr we had 11/8 news on cuts that prompt the stocks up but U prices were low.

thank you very much professional portfolio managers, "smart" ones too

3175 2018-12-18 14:00:47 many people invest money in things that are sin, like marijuana stocks and immoral activity stocks. the Bible says the love of money is the root of all evil. this is why landlords overcharge people. God hates those who oppress the poor. its wrong to get money by screwing others
3176 2018-12-18 14:00:30 For those of you who have invested in the Stock Market:  DO NOT SELL!  History shows us that the market always rebounds.  Hold onto your stocks and buy more if you can.  It will come back as soon as Trump resigns.
3177 2018-12-18 13:59:35 And given the comments about spares, readiness and munitions stocks there actually might be some important stuff going on here.
3178 2018-12-18 13:59:32 Completely dismissing it silly.  Did it change the course of monetary policy? Was the fed more aggressive with rate hikes? The tax plan raised taxes on the North east and California, the two largest contributors to US GDP.  Is that headwind being priced into stocks now?
3179 2018-12-18 13:59:27 They have professionals who will do whatever is needed to protect the people from you and your incompetent policy. The reason US economy is slowing and stocks are down is you

3189 2018-12-18 13:55:19 Hey @realDonaldTrump  has all your stocks doing in the market today?
3190 2018-12-18 13:55:02 This is the kind of lazy reporting that led to the bubble (which is currently collapsing) in weed stocks. This deal is window dressing. Like Novartis needs a pump and dump like Tilray to develop weed.
3191 2018-12-18 13:55:01 You are kidding, right? Rick Wilson book quotes a lobbyist saying he and his colleagues wore parts of that law so their corporate clients could buy back their stocks.
3192 2018-12-18 13:54:54 @realDonaldTrump, OH, @Twitter so "biased toward the Dems" that you dominated the top of my feed. Every damn day with your whining about this and that.

3196 2018-12-18 13:53:03 I believe this is great first mover positioning for when resource stocks pick up
3197 2018-12-18 13:52:50 With that ability to tell the future, your stocks should be doing well.
3198 2018-12-18 13:52:39 It's only "rare" because the US never had a president who tried to manipulate stocks in order to keep their own personal holdings up. He obviously never invested in tech sector and is taking his revenge while watching his retail holdings plummet. I'll bet he had a lot of GE too.

3205 2018-12-18 13:48:24 I didn't like Trump better when stocks were up, & I don't dislike him more now that stocks are down.  What concerns me is not the market but that Trump and Congress did is what W Bush and his Congress did...slashed taxes and didn't cut spending.  Long term that was bad.

3211 2018-12-18 13:46:34 Tip of the Day - when a Stock Market is volatile its an investor tell. It allows you to see the stocks you never heard about rise. I look to see “the Why” of movement. Keep this thought, “Every Stock movement has a story and reason.”- Dr_Stocks Think outside the normal day.

3217 2018-12-18 13:45:45 But doesn't happen. Trickle down economics is a lie. If the companies but the money into the pockets of the workers, that would be one thing, but when they buy back stocks and pay our bonuses to CEOs, which is what happens in reality, we are no better off.

3237 2018-12-18 13:36:15 @realDonaldTrump Why do u need $5B for the wall when Mexico is paying for the construction?  Also.... no tweets how your tariffs & trade wars have caused the major decline in stocks?
3238 2018-12-18 13:35:40 I hope for your sakes your stocks are doing great, don’t wish any ill will on you, but you don’t hear trump talking about stocks anymore and interest rates are going up again , we will see how the markets react , hopefully not like they did for the past year, Merry Christmas 
3239 2018-12-18 13:35:22 Wow is this a deliberately obtuse response?  Obviously she’s saying that lawmakers should not be able to purchase stocks and enrich themselves based on inside information/knowledge they have because of their positions while enforcing other ridiculously hypocritical ethics “rules”
3240 2018-12-18 13:35:15 @CityPGH 2/   other tragedies. I, too, believe we need laws banning assault weapons, bump stocks, and armor-piercing ammunition. And it would give me comfort to have an ERPO process in place so that families and law enforcement can temporarily seize firearms from individuals...

3246 2018-12-18 13:32:32 No thanks! I will stick with 0001 stocks like my name says! When you invest in stocks that are already in pennies and it goes down into the 00's the leverage works against you bad! With 0001 stocks, there is nowhere else to go but UP! Also every tick up is a fold on your money!

3249 2018-12-18 13:32:14 Building permits were down 30% YoY in November, 2006, kept plunging in 2007, and stocks made a new all-time high in Oct 2007. Just shows how different sentiment is this decade.

3258 2018-12-18 13:29:43 Best case scenario for stocks imo is for the Fed to raise rates Wednesday but announce a slowing of the Balance Sheet reduction. Market would rally hard on this news.

3261 2018-12-18 13:29:02 Wait, wait. 
I am so old that I thought when stocks were "up", bond yields are "down" and vice versa. 
Well, like Mark Twain, perhaps I am only remembering the things that never happened...
3262 2018-12-18 13:28:49 @federalreserve Auto stocks are down 30%, they’re not 10% or 11%, building stocks are down 35%, banks...are down 25%...the Russell is down 20%, retail equities are down over 20%  WHAT R U Watching ? ? ?
3263 2018-12-18 13:28:15 Zero political commentary here. My thoughts on stocks get enough people worked up already!

3265 2018-12-18 13:24:16 Conditions for small cap investing :1)improved liquidity 2)benign cost of capital 3)scope of operating leverage 4) stocks are classified as value stock and not growth stocks 5) lower commodity prices 6) improvement in capex cycle... risk reward is quiet favorable
3266 2018-12-18 13:24:13 $MYLI chart wise looks very good! Other than that, how do you think stocks run? There is always a front loader on every penny stock. If you disagree, can’t help you there. Look at all the recent runners, and here’s one $MDIN. Study it, and let me know what you think.
3267 2018-12-18 13:24:01 MSM spins narratives that relate the money/asset aspect of Bitcoin to the financial history money/stocks understandable to them and their "experts".  They couldn't do this when browsers/servers/web emerged.

3270 2018-12-18 13:21:56 UBS 1/2: current sell-off in risk assets, including global equities, is overdone. S&P 500 is on track to deliver 23% EPS growth this year while US stocks are now down nearly 5% on the year. So equity valuations have fallen to levels not seen since early16.But a rebound in markets
3271 2018-12-18 13:21:50 Josh, please explain your no stance here. I don’t agree with the statement in the sense that Dems taking the House is displacing the current market, but do agree in the sense the that Maxine Waters & Nanci Pelosi are bad for business & thusly bad for stocks.
3272 2018-12-18 13:21:42 .@WOOLWORTHS_SA you need to know that the delivery of an online wine order I received today is the most shambolic I have ever received.

3277 2018-12-18 13:19:58 It's just the globalists manipulating the markets, now they're shorting their stocks while selling them! Wake up FED!
3278 2018-12-18 13:18:58 I think QE/QT had/have about as much influence on stocks as they had/have on the Chicago Blackhawks.
3279 2018-12-18 13:18:55 @TripleDTrader Yes all Dow stocks were down yesterday.
3280 2018-12-18 13:18:45 Don't play the penny stocks.
3281 2018-12-18 13:18:19 If people want to liquidate, I’m not going to stand in their way 

Given solid but weakening eco data, tightening monetary policy & avg valuations we need a firm technical bottom to abate fear. While I still think stocks go higher in 2019, seems like we need to go lower first.
3282 2018-12-18 13:18:08 i heard a commercial on the radio trying to get people to buy their service to buy pot stock, similar to crypto 2017, gold 2012-current. RIP pot stocks, tell tale sign it's over, there will be winners over time but that's a big signal, crypto commercials started around 10k btc

3286 2018-12-18 13:17:14 Banking, NBFC, Metal, Auto, Cement, OMCs and Aviation stocks gained.
3287 2018-12-18 13:17:03 Tech stocks declined on account of fall in USDINR. TCS, Tech Mahindra, Infosys and Wipro declined 1-2%.
3288 2018-12-18 13:16:46 It can’t come soon enough. I’ve had it with this crap President and his enablers. I’m paying more in taxes, I have to worry about healthcare, my stocks are down, and I’m so tired of the gaslighting. I want my government back. Enough.
3289 2018-12-18 13:16:43 Yes and of the fed hikes rates it means the economy doesn't suck so that's good for stocks too
3290 2018-12-18 13:16:37 agree. I also love how most think that the FED not hiking will be good for stocks. Maybe on the day! But it's a sign in itself
3291 2018-12-18 13:16:27 Banking stocks surged as fall in 10-Year G-Sec Yield.
3292 2018-12-18 13:16:06 i cant believe he told the fed to grab the stocks market by the pussy
3293 2018-12-18 13:16:05 are there any stocks left po? huhuuhu
3294 2018-12-18 13:16:00 Well. I am comfortable with my rules. That like as there's 3 stocks and 8 minutes with "legal" stages including Delfino Plaza and Spear Pillar. By the way, Spear Pillar is my favorite stage.

Also, I am fine with battlefield form stages is just plain good.

3296 2018-12-18 13:15:46 Love this take:

if Fed hikes: U.S. institutions still strong, growth outlook intact, buy stocks

if Fed pauses: Fed not going to hike until something breaks, flexible, not dogmatic, buy stocks

3300 2018-12-18 13:15:17 On vous demande juste de communiquer sur les problèmes que vous rencontrez et pas de faire du cas par cas avec chacun qui vous envoi son id. Dites nous ce qu’il en est du problème de la fibre sur la delta, quels sont les stocks, etc....

3302 2018-12-18 13:15:03 Buying in pharma, metal and capital goods stocks offset losses in  information technology and FMCG stocks.  Sensex and Nifty ended 0.21%  and 0.19% higher respectively.
3303 2018-12-18 13:14:48 The full ruleset will be released at a later date, as we are still testing and considering different rules and stages. What we can say for now is that it will be 3 stocks with best of 3 in pools and best of 5 in bracket.
3304 2018-12-18 13:14:39 I am not an economist, but I believe the driver for economic growth and enabler is the ability to trade stocks. There was once talk of an east Africa stock exchange. What ever happened to that thinking? Any plans for an Ethiopian share trading platform?
3305 2018-12-18 13:14:29 Si, pero aún faltaba poder actualizar stocks. Por eso no lo dije. Podía pasar que comorárais algo que no había xd
3306 2018-12-18 13:14:26 The gymnastics Trump supporters can perform (Fed shouldn't hike, but economy is doing great, we'll win the trade war and investors should grow up and buy stocks) is just pathetic.
3307 2018-12-18 13:13:54 I wish you would read it before you make anymore mistakes. The market had a major crash yesterday in all of the health related stocks thanks to Fridays ruling against the ACA. #ThanksTrump

3310 2018-12-18 13:12:31 @steveliesman Auto stocks are down 30%, they’re not 10% or 11%, building stocks are down 35%, banks...are down 25%...the Russell is down 20%, retail equities are down over 20%. Markets r FORWARD looking, right Steve ?
3311 2018-12-18 13:12:16 As rates increase money is moved from the stock market into other assets and vice versa... Why? Because a company might see slower growth, higher debt expenses or lower revenue. people sell stocks to avoid a larger loss. This is why the market is down.
3312 2018-12-18 13:12:03 @JoeSquawk Auto stocks are down 30%, they’re not 10% or 11%, building stocks are down 35%, banks...are down 25%...the Russell is down 20%, retail equities are down over 20%.  Markets r FORWARD looking, so say the pros, right?
3313 2018-12-18 13:11:52 Given that @Naspers is the biggest daily traded volume of @JSE_Group and that @A2X_Markets has faster & cheaper transactional costs...I wonder how much Naspers #NPN trade will eventually migrate from the JSE o A2X and (now) if any other major ALSI-40 stocks will follow?

3322 2018-12-18 13:06:41 It appears stocks are rallying cause oil continues to crater, as the market wants to find hope in a Fed pause.   Eurodollar futures are higher this morning, despite an equity rebound., support this notion.  Can the Fed cite oil, and not Trump, for a pause?

3328 2018-12-18 13:04:51 Real Estate unit sales will be down in 2019 so will mortgage origination volumes and RE values will fall based on location. Financial stocks effected but not devastated. The 2008 USA crisis was a mortgage underwriting disaster and those practices never happened here.
3329 2018-12-18 13:04:37 Even the greatest managers had a turbulent initial few season before they got their footing . Maybe it's the way the beautiful game has changed, maybe it's the way merch sales and sponsorship define the victories or stocks plummeting after every loss 2/2
3330 2018-12-18 13:04:05 One more then a pause, and they may even be finished for this cycle. This period is similar to 94-95. Stocks likely to be up big in 2019.

But if stocks are on sale, I'm buying.
3339 2018-12-18 13:02:21 I couldn’t accept gifts working in Corporate America either. That’s not a bad policy. Divestment from individual stocks should be required for government officials who influence policy or legislation.

3355 2018-12-18 12:57:09 IMO, its a buying opportunity if you have a L-T investment horizon. Picking individual stocks right now will be rough. Less sexy, but a good index fund is a smart way to go (S&P 500,  etc.) Keep buying on the way down. when the mkt turns you'll be happy. And as always, diversify.
3356 2018-12-18 12:57:07 But unlike stocks, Bitcoin will recover faster than you think.
3357 2018-12-18 12:56:24 I'm glad that stocks are suffering. These rich fuckers deserve to squirm. I hope that the Dow tanks even further today! 
3358 2018-12-18 12:56:06 NPC's think stocks have no value unless you own them. God, son take an economics course. Stock value=employment.  Ignorance is a choice. Don't be ignorant fool.
3359 2018-12-18 12:54:13 China holding strong against Trump's Demands
FED to hike when many are saying it's a mistake
Government Shutdown coming
Housing Sales falling hard
Car Sales crashing down
Worldwide Slowdown

Not a single good news reason why stocks should rebound
3360 2018-12-18 12:53:57 It’s Trump’s stupid tariffs/trade war combined with the ruling on the ACA case a few weeks ago. Healthcare stocks are crashing as investors realize no one will be able to afford healthcare because they won’t have insurance.
3361 2018-12-18 12:53:55 Well this is weird... The only two individual stocks I own are $TSLA and $GE 

Luckily my 3 shares of $GE are not a significant portion of my portfolio.

3364 2018-12-18 12:53:23 And you need to sell stocks to meet redemptions.  Much more coming in days and weeks ahead, as people get their statements.  $SPY , $IWM , $QQQ
3365 2018-12-18 12:52:55 This is how they make their money-lending stocks to short. They certainly don’t make any with their    3 bps ETFs. Sad time in financial engineering. ETFs are becoming the hypodermic needle of market disease. Sell without bias. Buy without bias. @ReformedBroker

3368 2018-12-18 12:52:44 In a 5 minute timed game I wouldn’t mind because a timed game is never a loss despite getting killed 3 times by assist trophies or a lucky final smash. If stocks are the way you’re going, it’s infinitely better to just do raw item and final smashless smash.

Some cefs, ETFs, ETNs lost double and triple the $SPY as many are designed for ultra 2x and 3x. Overall blended perf of two ports + cash was -2.25%. Ok for 10% yield.

3374 2018-12-18 12:51:51 Hi again (100th message), wondering when you were going to reimburse me the money you owe due to holding my account hostage and not allowing me to close positions I requested to close on stocks and options I own as they tanked. #illegal @FINRA @SEC_Enforcement @RobinhoodApp
3375 2018-12-18 12:51:27 Yup! The album check is only for item 1. All LOVEs are welcome to come pick up 2 and 3 while stocks last. 
3376 2018-12-18 12:50:40 “Stocks on pace for their worst December since 1931.  Homelessness increasing.  Nearly 40,000 gun deaths.  Average life expectancy declining.  Record trade deficit with China.  Hate crimes rising.  CO2 emissions at highest level ever.  Suicides up.”

@realDonaldTrump
@Morning_Joe
3377 2018-12-18 12:50:10 Yes and it’s based on the company’s performance. Investing your money in a company that you don’t believe will succeed is not how you invest stocks. I’m a full supporter of crypto but it all depends on the coins performance + speculation. Just like the regular stock market.
3378 2018-12-18 12:50:03 Conversations with my parents consist of what stocks we are buying, where did time go?
3379 2018-12-18 12:49:52 I've started blocking every single sponsored tweet on my dash.
It started with normal ads like Apple, Ford, etc.
Soon it was stuff like Heroforge, Steam sales, Wish art tools.
Then... A lot of stocks and brokerage stuff
Then bitcoin and virus protection?
And now just. Spanish.

Maybe the problem was the low rates all along?
3381 2018-12-18 12:48:59 Government is thinking of waiving STT and STCG for those trading in agriculture and rural focused stocks.
3382 2018-12-18 12:47:17 For the last few years the vast majority was bullish and stocks rose persistently. It wouldn’t surprise me to see pervasive bearishness and a protracted decline.

3385 2018-12-18 12:46:24 If you think about it. $BTC is actually easier to buy for the average person than stocks.

3400 2018-12-18 12:38:13 Just so ya'll know, that dip in Verizon's stocks has nothing to do with the #tumblrpurge #tumblrlogout #tumblrprotest The stock market has just been fucked recently, its not just Verizon, and its been happening steadily for a while now.
3401 2018-12-18 12:37:59 We have to win with honesty, not being better at smoke and mirrors than the GOP.

In 2010, we failed to highlight the significance of ACA.

And lost.  

In 2020, healthcare will be the single most important thing for many Americans. 

So, should we market stocks or the ACA?

3430 2018-12-18 12:24:39 Then why not have a robot at the Fed: when stocks are down y/y, cut. When stocks are up hike one per quarter. The annoying thing is that cutting is in no way a guarantee to pump assets back up.

3435 2018-12-18 12:24:09 Low interest rates allow too much leverage to buy stocks on margin. No 12% usury cap has middle class up to their eyeballs in debt and can no longer afford to buy more goods. Also need to put hidden unemployed (16% to 22%) back to work, with tax credits tied to hiring.

3459 2018-12-18 12:11:56 I thought stocks were supposed to fall because of this news? I guess technical analysis is trumping fundamentals today.
3460 2018-12-18 12:11:40 My Thoughts on when to buy shares :
1) When the fake equity experts on twitter stop tweeting
2) Your uncle who made money in 2017 starts saying "share bazaar satta hain"
3) Old people feel FD are a better option 
4) You read about stocks markets tanking on the first page of news.

3462 2018-12-18 12:11:34 Trump appointed him. And in case you don't know, stocks fluctuate and a loss is only realized if you sell. They might go back up. Seriously, never ever react to what @LouDobbs says

3476 2018-12-18 12:09:24 Don't rush to buy. The transfer to strong hands is not over and will occur when stocks consolidate after drawdown.
3477 2018-12-18 12:09:23 Only way to support this thesis is by checking Qtrly shareholding across stocks. Where # of shareholders holding less than 2lacs of pd up cap (i.e. RETAIL) has gone up, they havn't exited. They have been chipkaoed maal. Most r still trapped by avging down. Dat's d sad reality.

3481 2018-12-18 12:08:44 U.S. stocks plummeted on Monday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average  sank more than 500 points, putting the index deeper in negative  territory for 2018. Investors don't trust the incoming Democrat majority House. Dems took the House and the Market plummets.
3482 2018-12-18 12:08:30 @realDonaldTrump hey so what do you have to say about the stocks being down to the lowest since 1931
3483 2018-12-18 12:08:21 Where do you find list of stocks which are 25-30% off 52week high. I can only find 52week high stocks, but not for those which are little off it.

3488 2018-12-18 12:06:05 Both negative? As rates have risen? So much for the "financial repression" theory? At least stocks and property had their day in the Sun?
3489 2018-12-18 12:05:51 The cabal has the ability to sell off HUGE amounts of stocks at one time to cause a crash on Wall Street. Couple that with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, creates an artificial recession... to ruin POTUS' great economy. ALL TO OUST TRUMP.
3490 2018-12-18 12:05:07 Keep telling yourself that it wasn't about tax breaks for wealthy donors and corporations. Most companies are buying back their stocks. You have massively increased the deficit. So long.

Je n'ai pas d'informations sur nos stocks et quand ils seront refaits. Je suis désolé pour le désagrément.
Généralement, ils sont refaits en début de semaine.

Je vous souhaite une agréable journée.

Bien cordialement,
Romain,
Votre Conseiller Philips.
3586 2018-12-18 11:07:44 L&T, ICICI Bank among top largecap bets for 2019 by Credit Suisse
                    Credit Suisse prefers investment-related stocks  (due to likely continuity in public capex growth) over  consumption-focussed stocks for India in 2019.
3587 2018-12-18 11:07:41 Okay. May stocks na din ako 
3588 2018-12-18 11:06:55 Unless something miraculous happens with the Federal reserve today I would personally be out completely of the stocks and bonds by 4pm unless you don't mind risking your investments getting wiped out by 30%
3589 2018-12-18 11:06:54 AVL, KRR,AUZ ,AVZ and all the Cobalt stocks basically took most of the Aussie retail to the cleaners in 2018. Very few might have booked profits and protected themselves in this carnage.

3594 2018-12-18 11:03:49 Obamacare was was a weakened program,but it was needed and 500 points downside in stock market was due to concern in med stocks and related issues.  There needs to be a national medical program. I see nothing from your administration, to take care of our needy citizens.
3595 2018-12-18 11:02:20 Here i was thinking id buy 1 case but then checked out 3 cases  hopefully they have stocks available for my model.
3596 2018-12-18 11:02:01 It doesn't matter what the house thinks, because the EU is the one who cuts off the pipe. But even if that wasn't true, the house of commons already passed No Deal into law, with the Withdrawal Act of 2017.

And the rich are going to get much, much richer by shorting £ and stocks
3597 2018-12-18 11:01:20 Jim you are THE tutor to so many of us.   Can you explain a bit how the lack of liquidity and the pressure ETF play on common stocks?  If not here on a future show.

I'm sorry that you feel this way , however our offer was whilst stocks last, 

and we are now unfortunately out of stock. We run a range of promotional offers 

throughout the year and encourage customers to always keep their eyes peeled.

3601 2018-12-18 10:59:10 How many times have United fans mocked previous Liverpool managers who have tried & failed? Whenever Liverpool fans talk about 'the old days' we become laughing stocks. Screw a fun United, everyone's laughing at their demise.
3602 2018-12-18 10:59:05 For buying stocks. Yes.

3606 2018-12-18 10:56:33 Another way to destroy President Trump is for The Billionaires to sell off stocks, move the money overseas and let the 401K accounts lose all they have made in 2016-2018. I don’t know this for sure but I know people like the Koch Brothers are so jealous of the President.
3607 2018-12-18 10:56:08 @realDonaldTrump Well, Mr. President, U.S. stocks are on track to have the WORST December since THE GREAT DEPRESSION! Going to take a victory lap?
3608 2018-12-18 10:55:36 Yeah these kinds of Stocks just get obliterated when the Buying Pressure dries up. Liquidity risk off the scale on this kind of thing.
3609 2018-12-18 10:55:30 Solo cuatro acciones de la #BVC están en verde en 2018: Ecopetrol +30.09%, Bancolombia +4.47%, PF Bancolombia +5.28% y PF Davivienda +5.34%. Y en lo corrido del año el índice #COLCAP acumula una desvalorización de -11.76% #stocks
3610 2018-12-18 10:55:03 Kind of an odd statistic, when you think of it.  One would think that the value of stocks would go up with fewer taxes.  Makes you wonder whether investing is tied to strictly facts, or emotion.  Basing investments on emotion alone isn't good.  You might as well go play bingo.:-)
3611 2018-12-18 10:55:02 But what does his voting record say? Is there any analysis that his votes are swayed by owning these stocks? If not this click bait.

3625 2018-12-18 10:43:44 Not to mention the utter decimation of west coast sea trout stocks also marine ecosystems destroyed by trawling for sand eels to produce high protein food for farmed salmon. More akin to indiscriminate open cast mining than true farming.

3632 2018-12-18 10:35:53 I never peel baby carrots, but a standard carrot I find the peel to be bitter, so I even peel those for stocks and soups. Potatoes I only peel for aesthetics. I never peel for things like au gratin, hand cut fries, etc. but for a nice pommes purée, I always peel

3642 2018-12-18 10:28:53 Hm aber die BaFin hat doch Risikoklassen vorgegeben, in die man Kunden einteilt.

3718 2018-12-18 09:37:59 In a period during which even strong stocks like Amazon are falling by over 20 percent on a quarterly basis, the future of the global stock and financial market remains unpredictable.
3719 2018-12-18 09:37:47 Who here believes QE 4 will work? Every CB measure since 09 produced 1) subpar growth, 2) exploded debts & 3) ramped stocks. QE 4 produces more  of 1 & 2 but no guarantee of 3. To risky. To dangerous. To damn stupid to repeat but this is our CB so who knows.

3756 2018-12-18 09:16:48 Good post. Your other recent posts (the Christmas ideas) seem to ignore these obvious “huge discount to NAV” stocks and rather go for more not-so-obvious cases. Are these simple ideas (that on the face of it seem like the definition of “value”) not better than say a Raddison?

3779 2018-12-18 08:57:17 If the EU block fish from being sold into their markets, so be it. We'll eat it ourselves and allow fish stocks to recover.
Surely a regime that instructs fishermen to throw dead fish back into the sea is, to say the least, short sighted and foolish.

Quite comparable to the period we had in January.

3914 2018-12-18 07:15:43 This is why I don't like buying CALLS/PUTS outright in this environment. IV is way high. I think spreads are better if your account supports the short legs. Selling cash backed PUTs in stocks you want to own is good right now to capture that premium.
3915 2018-12-18 07:15:27 That depends on what you’ve invested in. My stocks are doing marvelously over the last 12 months.

3956 2018-12-18 06:44:19 Asian stocks fell on Tuesday, tracking losses on Wall Street as traders braced for an interest rate hike by Federal Reserve.
3957 2018-12-18 06:44:17 When a true bear market arrives headlines are typically like “stocks just made a 7-year low” not like right now “we are at the levels of at the end of 2017”.
3958 2018-12-18 06:44:06 Asian stocks fell on Tuesday, tracking losses on Wall Street as traders braced for an interest rate hike by Federal Reserve.

$AGG: -0.83%
$SPY: -2.67%
3961 2018-12-18 06:41:30 Financials are short-term badly over-sold while utilities are making a cyclical bubble top, just as they did in December 2000 and December 2007. Long-only managers pile into them in early bear markets when the writing is on the wall that cyclicals and momentum stocks are toast.
3962 2018-12-18 06:41:19 or use SAP or r3 Corda  whatever. It is a perfect match so it is a matter of time (regulation?). AMZN don't miss their chances to grow - for me it is very suspicious that they are not talking about it already to build some interest while stocks are going down 
3963 2018-12-18 06:40:18 4 buy rated stocks from Power Transmission & Equipment....
3964 2018-12-18 06:39:59 In fact members of Congress were insider trading, which is illegal for the rest of us. The Stock Act signed by President Obama in 2012, stopped Congressmen from trading stocks on information the general public didn’t have.But that didn’t stop some. Are they in jail.
3965 2018-12-18 06:39:54 3 stocks open a bigger window for someone to change things around. Once you lose a stock in a 2 stock match you have to take out both of your opponents stocks
3966 2018-12-18 06:38:35 Super stocks are being born.
3967 2018-12-18 06:37:32 I'm always here for three stocks. Or is there a better way?
3968 2018-12-18 06:36:28 In a bear market you can find a set of the most worthless penny stocks that trade on high vol. .13 cents to .33 cents is the scan. On high vol days a sell off in major markets occurs after. Takes a couple days.
3969 2018-12-18 06:36:10 You know it’s gonna be a good party when my dad tests out and prepares the speakers for karaoke and stocks up the bar 
3970 2018-12-18 06:35:55 just a quick question bro. Can u leverage trade indian stocks? in forex we can leverage upto 1000x our capital
3971 2018-12-18 06:34:49 Fastest way to be a millionaire, run for Congress, they buy stocks in the laws they about to make #insidetrade at least some of us knew that already
3972 2018-12-18 06:33:49 Stocks are in the toilet and you are bailing out farmers after killing their business. So much winning......
3973 2018-12-18 06:33:12 Guten Morgen, leider bringt Santa Claus heuer keine Geschenke für die Anleger: #WallStreet hat einen der schwächsten Dezember aller Zeiten, Dow und S&P haben jeweils rund 7,5% verloren .... #stocks, #investing
3974 2018-12-18 06:32:59 So far been long a couple stocks that have barely been grazed. On Tuesday I am going more aggressive long some other names and going to take on some index options as well. Hoping for any level around Monday close level to initiate longs. $SPY
3975 2018-12-18 06:30:04 You know you old when you constantly checking your stocks
3976 2018-12-18 06:29:16 Stocks are tanking, genius
3977 2018-12-18 06:28:29 Well Trump violated the 2A by banning bump stocks, so it looks like we're getting screwed by both sides.
3978 2018-12-18 06:27:20 Stocks and bitcoin plummeting.
3979 2018-12-18 06:26:54 Trump is too busy banning bump stocks for the entire nation because ONE GUY used one in a crime.
3980 2018-12-18 06:25:13 Also this comment “we do not condone gambling in any way shape of form.”  Feel free to give back any money you have invested in real estate, stocks, bitcoin, currency markets, etc then.  Love when people ignorantly self indict themselves trying to pass judgment on others.
3981 2018-12-18 06:23:58 Tell me ur stocks pls , I will look after that
3982 2018-12-18 06:22:56 Live PD is what I’m watching when I’m not watching stocks.
3983 2018-12-18 06:22:21 So I played maister the gnw from Mexico on WiFi and we had such ridiculous games. Non stop 2 stocks back to back for like 9 games. He even complimented my ridley
3984 2018-12-18 06:22:19 They teach time value of money concepts in common core but they don’t offer a finance class. That’s where you learn about stocks and shit! Yes offer that too in high school!
3985 2018-12-18 06:20:56 Domestic MF inflows into equities are proving to be only game in town. Most participants believe that till such times that SIPs/equity inflows continue stocks wouldn't fall. How many times in history these 'foolproof', 'this time its different' logic ended badly? Almost always!
3986 2018-12-18 06:20:53 @realDonaldTrump : Yea that sucks but I can't do anything about antifa, I'm too busy banning the bump stocks of people who have never committed a crime with them.
3987 2018-12-18 06:20:52 Tariffs mostly.  Most companies guiding lower (pushing stocks lower) because of increased raw costs.  Many are pushing that onto consumers but with wages stagnant, that wont last long.  Home & auto sales down.  Cost to build way up, again mainly due to tariffs.  Farmers suffering
3988 2018-12-18 06:20:29 Bucking the trend: 20 stocks gave stellar returns even as mid, smallcaps disappointed
3989 2018-12-18 06:19:31 Kanang mao pay pag abot sa stocks nya hurot lang dayon ... Wa mn lang ko ka picture ... 
3990 2018-12-18 06:18:15 Nah, too busy banning his supporters' bumo stocks. Smashing 7 people in their skull with a bike lock is totally cool though, oh and vote for me again please.

4000 2018-12-18 06:11:32 Would disagree bit : Many of the underlying PSU stocks are trading cheap only due to supply overhang or fear of more supply ?
Look at ITC trading at discount to other FMCG, it is part of Bharat 22 ETF? 
Classical case of stocks underpriced due to reasons unrelated to performance?
4001 2018-12-18 06:11:01 ( only there stocks are going up cause of the plans Verizon has to sell it as ad space )
4002 2018-12-18 06:10:59 Going to counter the bulls. With the run up since the inception of stocks if you front run what is there to be optimistic about when productivity and lifespan has been in decline.

4005 2018-12-18 06:09:56 Mike, the town council will take up banning assault weapons, extended magazines and bump stocks.
State law says municipal Governments can't make their own gun control laws. Please Google B4 u post. Not unconstitutional. If u we're mayor, responsible 4 citizens, makes sense to ASK
4006 2018-12-18 06:09:10 Sir one small help required... Since YOU are an Expert Options trader so please share in which stocks we may trade Options without the fear of less liquidity.
4007 2018-12-18 06:07:46 Buy Capital first at 565. We can expect price can touch to the level of 600-620 soon. #stocks #trading #investing
4008 2018-12-18 06:06:30 The stock market continues to crash because of you.  The tax break you gave to the filthy rich has backfired. All they did with that money was buy back their own stocks.   You are destroying this country in every possible way.   Please resign.
4009 2018-12-18 06:04:38 The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks plunged into a bear market Monday,reflecting a 20% decline since hitting a record high in late August.
Marks the first bear market for the index since the downturn that spanned June 2015 to February 2016.

4011 2018-12-18 06:02:05 A perfect example of Joan Robinson’s line about economics being the science of confusing stocks and flows.
4012 2018-12-18 06:01:52 During the eight Obama years GDP was 2.0% or less, usually less. Thats anemic growth, sickly. It was awful. Apparently you haven't seen a good economy. You will next year. Europeans are dumping our stocks but the Free Market will roll on. We don't need them. Watch for 5.0% GDP.
4013 2018-12-18 06:01:44 Economy stronger? The stocks for the year are at a total loss for the entire year and plus some. All the money I’ve made this year in my stocks are gone and plus some. It’s benefiting ppl at the top. Dumbass
4014 2018-12-18 06:01:12 The legacy Obama left was that the country didn’t rank. The stock mkt which was healthy when Obama left has been stuttering all year. Trump says it’s his now. But you know WGAF when we don’t have stocks. But TrumpDontCare about what you make how sick you are or how dirty  is.
4015 2018-12-18 06:00:54 Out of all the stocks I follow, only GE and Bank of America finished in the green today. Completely awful 
4016 2018-12-18 06:00:27 It's Obama's fault the stocks are falling!

4019 2018-12-18 05:58:52 His talks of raising interest rates really mucked up my REITs and common utility stocks 
4020 2018-12-18 05:58:42 I would buy 1000 shares in weed stocks valued at 25550 and with the rest i would pay of a 28k debt and theni would buy another 675 shares in weed stocks valued at 21968 and then pay for college and the last thing i would do is give back to my friends and family
4021 2018-12-18 05:58:29 Semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, large capacity magazines, and any one who stock piles weapons are the real problems.

4024 2018-12-18 05:57:49 @realDonaldTrump now that multiple #antifa terrorists are facing felony hate crime charges for beating minorities while hurling racial slurs... why won't you officially label them a terror org? Too busy banning the bump stocks of law abiding people I guess...

4027 2018-12-18 05:57:08 1/ Tough day for all stocks today but TSLA broke tight pendant formation very hard to the downside.  Very bearish chart pattern.  I think the Q3 numbers were juiced, that it might have been peak $TSLA.

4029 2018-12-18 05:55:52 Every time he mentions anything that involves any market : stocks,commodities, even an individual corporation - that moves the market. And if he tells a friend what he’s going to say, 5 minutes (or 15 seconds) before he says it - that person can make a fortune off the info.

4032 2018-12-18 05:55:03 What are we waking up to? Major US equity indices all closed lower yesterday as markets expect another hike from the Fed this week. Nasdaq, Dow Jones and the S&P 500 all lost over 2% yesterday and the sell-off in stocks continued this morning in the Asian markets.
4033 2018-12-18 05:54:56 Looks like some pretty strong attempts at buying out a bottom in a lot of altcoins is happening. I wonder..
Likely, for unleveraged folks, the "penny stocks of crypto" will make the most sense as a few changes of cents will mean 20-30% jumps already.
4034 2018-12-18 05:54:29 Stocks hit their lows of the day on disappointment that Chinese President Xi Jinping omitted any mention of new reforms or stimulus measures to prop up the economy in a keynote speech hailing his country’s opening up to the world.

4037 2018-12-18 05:53:50 The most difficult aspect of trading volatile, cyclical stocks is following the correct cycle, and getting in and out before the trend reverses. The Aroon indicators measure periods since the value recorded a peak or valley to reveal the beginning of new trends. #BTC #Aroon

4049 2018-12-18 05:49:00 @BarackObama  1st down year for the Dow since 2008, back when Bush was president. Stocks increased in value every year doing the Obama years. President Obama's tax & budget policies ended in January of this year
Since then stocks have gone down & the budget deficit has gone up.

4070 2018-12-18 05:39:09 Just when my stocks were looking good I'm currently losing  2.3 percent of what I have invested so far. I'm kinda hurt, maybe it's just cause of the holiday let me ride it out just a few more weeks.
4071 2018-12-18 05:36:54 Probably more in line with other assets, homes, college tuition, stocks. Anything really post the gold window. Not sure what that # is. 4-5K maybe.
4072 2018-12-18 05:36:50 invest in stocks
4073 2018-12-18 05:36:18 Whatever stocks i have selected and invested are based on some principles and strategy.

However currently that's not working but it does not mean that I should try to adopt new one,

These strategies have worked in past and will work in future also.

4075 2018-12-18 05:35:13 Had a long talk with a dairy farmer friend of mine this weekend.  Not a single dairy farmer in this country is even close to breaking even.  They work 365 days a year and lose money.  Maybe he should do something more productive like trade stocks.

4078 2018-12-18 05:34:41 Why are people still doing two stocks? That shit is OVER.

4081 2018-12-18 05:34:25 Lol I was just joking. The stocks of course is down. But you can go long the egg commodity (if there is one)
4082 2018-12-18 05:30:48 Because that's insane and unsupported by any reasonable analysis. Stocks have had a bad year long before Dems took the house
4083 2018-12-18 05:30:00 Can't wait for it. I've sold 80% of my portfolio in November. Sitting on the cash. Hope it happens soon.

4084 2018-12-18 05:28:19 Honestly this market is great it’s fascinating to see all these twtr pros “hedges” at 2900 plus keeping their long at break even. Especially some stocks downs 30-40%  and they are option players lol
4085 2018-12-18 05:27:41 How holding company generates  cash flow:
1. Profitability shares 
2. Dividends
3. Service revenue to owned companies
4. Buying and selling assets like stocks
4086 2018-12-18 05:27:19 Will you trade stocks? Do you trade stocks?
4087 2018-12-18 05:26:24 I mean it’s just like the stock market. You never sell stocks when they are low, you buy them and wait until they go back up and then profit. I’ve been card collecting but buying a lot of cards to flip in a week or two. The card values will recover.
4088 2018-12-18 05:25:44 Prefer to wait until after a big stock market crash and panic liquidation / run into the USD. Like 2008--gold tanked 30% when stocks tanked, then they respond with more QE. Too early, IMHO. Currently not cheap yet on a purchasing power valuation basis. I like equity shorts/puts.
4089 2018-12-18 05:25:01 How many crimes have been committed with bump stocks? Perhaps we should just make murder illegal. Put some more drug free zone signs...
4090 2018-12-18 05:24:42 It’s official, stock market investments are now less than what they were 12/31/2017. 

Let’s talk about how to get off the craziness of stocks and secure a strong investment in real estate

#RealEstateInvesting #AeirgedCapital
4091 2018-12-18 05:24:16 Possible but chances are less as he has not squared off his position in any of the these stocks.
High possibility could be withdrawal of funds from few of his investors.
4092 2018-12-18 05:23:45 Also, employees are allowed to own stocks/bonds from a company they work at. Then they can get the benifits if hourly wage with job security as well as the profits of the company... of the company is corporate. You assume workers can’t obtain profits... but that’s not true.
4093 2018-12-18 05:23:30 RT TheBullBull "Ashoka Buildcon promoter on TV

I am wary of stocks whose promoters get interviewed on TV. There will be a few exceptions, of course."
4094 2018-12-18 05:23:13 "Gartman said to buy stocks."
4095 2018-12-18 05:22:58 It is much easier for Luigi to get a grab and there are less stocks so a guaranteed 0-death makes a bigger difference
4096 2018-12-18 05:22:24 Of course all that is correct. It’s the continuation of Obama’s time. You like facts. Obama brought unemployment from 10% to 4.6%. Stocks from 8000 to 19000. No trade wars. No need to increase anything from Fed. Trump is not good for USA  ask a farmer
4097 2018-12-18 05:22:14 Why are these big gaming companies trying to play us gamers? Glad their stocks are tanking. Let’s see who gets played when nobody wants to buy y’alls regurgitated content.
4098 2018-12-18 05:21:58 Legislators should not be allowed to trade stocks or commodities for the duration of their terms.
4099 2018-12-18 05:21:55 Members of Congress always were "allowed" insider trader as part of a "gray area." They are privy to all kinds of company secrets and then would go buy or sell the stocks. And they think that's ok.

4101 2018-12-18 05:19:05 @NancyCNBC @_HadleyGamble Goodmorning i think this bear market is negative not just by current negative news , but the way it acts as if the market is waiting for more bad news to come! so just one small bad news is enough to push stocks more down!
4102 2018-12-18 05:19:04 The #Federal Reserve and the #Media, at least for today, will drive the #Market. People are jittery everywhere. There is a shift happening. People have a boycott mindset after last year. The only thing it's Balanced right now between the left and the right. #Stocks

4105 2018-12-18 05:16:05 17.12.18: Internal and external pressures increase ICE fell sharply. On , the Dec. 17 cotton market remained bearishly inside and outside.The rise of the US dollar,the fall in US stocks and oil prices,and the slow progress of trade negotiations made traders unintentionally long

4120 2018-12-18 05:06:21 I'm a little curious of your trade abilities if your stocks are down from where they were on Jan. 20 2017. Just sayin...
4121 2018-12-18 05:06:18 1. Stocks worst December start since the Great Depression;
2. 12% decline in housing sales;
3. Inflation increased throughout 2018;
4. Credit card and student loan debts at record highs;
5. Trump started a trade war without a clear end goal.

It's not a Victory it's a Recession

4124 2018-12-18 05:04:31 My question is what does Obama have in this? What's his pay off? Does he own stocks or something in all of this somehow?
4125 2018-12-18 05:03:24 Looks to me like the S&P’s div yield is about the same level as it was in early 2010—which was a pretty good time to be buying stocks. And I think the 10yr Treasury was notably higher then, too..
4126 2018-12-18 05:03:04 Did the investors cause the stocks to fall prior to the Corporate buy-back?
4127 2018-12-18 05:02:48 Yup. Bitcoin became the example set for all crypto and it wasn’t a good one. That’s why I didn’t invest in it. Procter and Gamble stocks are looking good though. I mean not as much as they did 6 years ago back when their shares were $11 with a low investor volume.
4128 2018-12-18 05:01:01  Speculative positions created in INFY are offloaded...Remember last week, Stock Future was increasing & infy was one of the most active stocks that was increasing (Speculative Buying)..Other such stocks will follow the suit

He is helping #BeautifulCoal make a comeback

Bad weather also for #US and #China retail.

4134 2018-12-18 04:57:56 I only started buying individual stocks back in October. I figured that downturn was a good time to get in. It went further down, so I bought more of several of my stocks. I keep adding, and it keeps dropping. I feel like it's going to get worse, but will eventually get better.
4135 2018-12-18 04:56:54 I'll second that: even during the 2007 crash, the dividends from all of the dividend aristocrat stocks kept climbing upward.  Bear markets are the best time to buy sound dividend paying companies.

no one ever thinks to temporarily join up to take out the guy with all of his stocks left, instead they go for everyone else and then lose because that one guy had a huge stock and life advantage

4164 2018-12-18 04:41:13 It's looking like it's about to drop. It's hitting the support line it's been at all year and doesn't look like there's much confidence to bounce back up. If you own stocks, just keep an eye out. It could be a slow decline or it could be massive. Be ready.

4173 2018-12-18 04:31:47 That’s a huuuuge advantage for them. I just think that it’ll discredit their trustworthiness being involved with stocks to the public. What’re your thoughts?
4174 2018-12-18 04:31:45 On a long enough time frame ALL stocks go to zero. There are NO original DOW stocks. That's why they call them "stocks & bonds"

4189 2018-12-18 04:24:17 Yep right before a World War. Been on this earth to see many wars. Wars bring the stocks up.
4190 2018-12-18 04:23:50 My view is higher treasuries and higher stocks with significantly volatility.
4191 2018-12-18 04:23:05 These types of market crashes have happened multiple times throughout the last few years. The probsbility that this time is different and stocks don't regain ATH for a long time is much higher than any other time in the last decade.

AO-C says: “...somehow allow members w/ investment portfolios to write laws that will personally enrich them $1000s in their own stocks; potentially millions.”

Its interesting how she cleverly uses the passive word “members”.  Many of those members are in fact Democrats.

4194 2018-12-18 04:21:46 c. Because there is less foreign buying and more US selling, yields will need to rise in order to get US investors to buy more UST.  This will drive up yields, causing 3.
d. Higher yields will attract money from stocks and will cause stocks to be discounted harder, causing 1.
4195 2018-12-18 04:19:49 No, not so much. In 2017, he was bearish on stocks. That didn’t turn out 2 well either. When U R consistently bullish, a bull market always makes you look like a genius. I’ve never seen this guy say he was wrong. Rather, he has said that the market is wrong. And that’s just dumb.

4209 2018-12-18 04:12:59 I bought US steel at around $22 after a huge dip in April of 2017, which was around the first time I started buying stocks.  It dropped to 19$ or so and I decided that was too much and sold.  About 6 months ago and it had doubled.  Last couple days it has fallen to $19 again.
4210 2018-12-18 04:12:52 2018 has been the worst year for stocks since the Great Depression.  Come back to planet earth!  You r a disaster as a president and you’ve eroded our standing in the world.  Please resign and take Pence with you!
4211 2018-12-18 04:11:40 Sooo divest in all stocks you have a conflict in? Or sign over control to a 3rd party money management intermediary for the duration of your term?
4212 2018-12-18 04:11:40 The last bond guy to do that was Bill Gross who said in spring 2009 (the bottom) that stocks stunk so bad you can smell them.  Maybe Gundlach will carry the same contrarian magic.

4214 2018-12-18 04:09:13 Stock market is tanking because of the fake news media and waiting on the big Russian collusion. The Democrats and all these Russian fake news is what's contributing to the market drop. Initially stocks were going up even with the first Tariffs..

4219 2018-12-18 04:07:02 Saudi & Canadian oil export cuts to U.S. will be bullish for #oil & oil #stocks over intermediate term. That will give markets confidence.

4250 2018-12-18 03:51:55 This is not a buying oppurtunity for stocks. Do you have any idea why the market is down? The Fed raising interest rates too quickly; The demise of the FANG stocks, and  China and US trade wars. China also reported bad economic numbers. Also US predicted to go into recession.

4275 2018-12-18 03:41:28 $nbev No MBA here. Don't need one to figure out the market mis-prices stocks from time to time & that NBEV is below its industry peers.

4307 2018-12-18 03:24:57 In the first chapter of #principles, he says that he leant not to make big predictions. Either he didn’t or principles are only for preaching. There is a more sinister explanation- stuff people with stocks they want to sell.
4308 2018-12-18 03:24:51 That would mean that it would have to go to $4 or $40 respectively from its current position of $0.40! When in the history of penny stocks have you ever seen a move like that? So I don't see it happening!
4309 2018-12-18 03:23:04 Cant blame Trump stocks went down when the Democrats won the senate. #maga

4313 2018-12-18 03:22:14 Buy stocks early.
4314 2018-12-18 03:22:09 Maybe but think stocks will rally massively if the Fed doesn’t hike. It could be a hawkish hold as #Powell keeps door open to hike if financial conditions improve

4319 2018-12-18 03:19:53 ... and that would throw everyone one off who was leaning on that watchlist. Like it would completely trash their put option contracts if they choose not to raise them. If they do raise them, business as usually with stocks dropping. I’ll drop a short term list then.

4321 2018-12-18 03:17:52 @realDonaldTrump The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are on pace for their worst December performance since 1931, when stocks were battered during the Great Depression. The Dow and S&P 500 are down 7.8 percent and 7.6 percent this month, respectively.

Great job BOZO
4322 2018-12-18 03:17:32 And nearly all of the commentary amounts to: “I believe that stocks will go up eventually but may go down in the short run.”

4327 2018-12-18 03:15:29 A nice touch, the falling ash of the burned bonds and stocks. Despite the absence of snow, I'm with you: it's a Christmas movie!
4328 2018-12-18 03:15:07 Only the people at home who's companies and stocks let them profit off of those wars. But the men and women we send to war, and the men and women they fight against, and all of their families - don't get rich, and don't win.

4335 2018-12-18 03:13:13 I look for stocks which will not turn back and SL is just a formaility. I do not like a trade which is based on premise that if wrong. "... SL to hai na ?... "

4338 2018-12-18 03:11:45 US Fed policy is ahead of us so, all strategies go with lower capital allocation. Why to be aggressive? Better to be conservative!

500 point+ rally so that also demands strategy with lower allocation

4400 2018-12-18 02:35:52 The news channels will leave no stone unturned to make u believe that global growth has slowed down and we are in a bear market.

However great portfolios are made in a bear market when stocks are available cheap....so that one can make a lot of money in the next bull run!

4402 2018-12-18 02:35:13 I think it’s insane to NOT allow lawmakers to own stock but there’s no reason they couldn’t be allowed to not buy stock while they are in office. 
If you have stocks when you take office you shouldn’t have to liquidate but I understand not letting them buy while in office

4423 2018-12-18 02:29:36 But…on the flip side, never underestimate, the other man’s greed! Time to buy some more stocks while they’re cheap!
4424 2018-12-18 02:29:35 The single most stock market mover as of end of business day today was the prospects of another hike in the Fed's fund rate. The higher the risk free rate, the worse for stocks. People will flood cash Investments in the place of risky assets. NOTHING TO DO WITH @realDonaldTrump
4425 2018-12-18 02:29:08 Who is authoring these tweets doesn’t understand #cryptocurrency or #bitcoin - It was a bubble due to reasons unlike any other market to date including real estate and stocks. These tweets ignore huge market regulations in Asia that used crypto at 5x the use seen in US.
4426 2018-12-18 02:28:27 And by the way my 401k is up big since November 2016 my properties are doing good if you don't know how to handle your assets with the proper risk protection then you're a newbie? What stocks do you own time for the crickets

4429 2018-12-18 02:24:54 You have no perspective.  I think the overwhelming majority of Americans now see that there is NO winning with you, only LOSING.  Resign and let this nation get back on the course to greatness, where it was going with @BarackObama You are dragging us down! Stocks, health care GO!

4435 2018-12-18 02:21:31 So it is possible, likely even that growth continues.

Crisis in 2019 seems to be cyclical, structural, political, social still.

Stocks ? Fundaments will matter at some point, how low is that ?
4436 2018-12-18 02:21:11 Having a quiet night after typical busy Monday, pleased Bitcoin is above 3500 USD, but will it hold? Wondering what stocks will do in final days of 2018?
4437 2018-12-18 02:20:25 I see clear skys on the horizon. I hope my stocks rise. Lol.
4438 2018-12-18 02:20:07 Some players rumored to be declaring don’t have the highest of draft stocks either but are declaring. Look at Trent Thompson who declared and needed one more year and sadly didn’t get picked up. Ask them if it was all business in their decision.
4439 2018-12-18 02:19:51 @RobInTheBlack Although we are in FTC in many high market cap stocks - possibly reaching exhaustion, would it be better to wait for full reversals or buy puts in VXX?
4440 2018-12-18 02:19:49 C'mon. Fess up. Do you have stocks in this thing? Because outside of Ken Hamm & AiG, nobody promotes it more than you do.
4441 2018-12-18 02:19:10 When is my cannabis stocks going to turn around.. smfh thank god for blue chips 
4442 2018-12-18 02:19:09 First, I don’t care where the embassy goes. Second, the Moab wasn’t a bad thing, third, the ban on bump stocks hasn’t even happened. 

Aside from what was stated above, military at the border, asylum ban, tariffs, Supreme Court, withdrawal from TPP, And much more.
4443 2018-12-18 02:19:03 I don’t think so.  The low stock market numbers , attracts new investors who feel they can invest in certain stocks, that were previously out of reach
4444 2018-12-18 02:18:54 Asian stocks open lower on Tuesday following an overnight sell-off on Wall Street
4445 2018-12-18 02:18:31 And stocks in USA are plummeting due to tarrifs and tax hikes. Prices of many products will go up. Many items we buy daily. Sad
4446 2018-12-18 02:17:48 Honestly. lol I’ve considered checking stocks on my phone.
4447 2018-12-18 02:17:42 Bailouts for farmers and tax breaks for corporations to buy back their stocks.
You’re a genius/s
4448 2018-12-18 02:16:02 Except the democrats haven't done anything yet because they haven't started yet. And stocks have been dropping down since before the election.
4449 2018-12-18 02:15:23 A sell-off in U.S. stocks that sent the S&P 500 Index to its lowest close in 14 months spread to Asia, suggesting investor worries about the outlook for growth that are at odds with the projected Federal Reserve interest-rate hike on Wednesday.
4450 2018-12-18 02:15:10 The following have no stocks that meet the criteria today:

4451 2018-12-18 02:15:01 What I lost in stocks this month and my 401k got a nigga sick
4452 2018-12-18 02:14:38 Why look at index! 
I shud be invested in low pe stocks and should care about my portfolio! 

If pe is high ,it would be high because the companies have quality!
4453 2018-12-18 02:14:34 Hang in there , it may bounce tomorrow..if you didn’t sell you didn’t lose , but watching trump screw up is painful, I have been doing stocks 35 yrs and get discouraged at times..
4454 2018-12-18 02:14:23 Buy.  It has to go back up eventually - that's what stocks do.
4455 2018-12-18 02:14:18 there was a moderate bubble that is being corrected.  Most value stocks are within 10% of their proper price
4456 2018-12-18 02:14:15 And the Dow Transports should be rallying hard, transporting goods all over the nation for Christmas. Yet those stocks are tanking hard. Love your analysis.
4457 2018-12-18 02:13:57 The #StockMarket sat on a precipice at start of the day. #Healthcare stocks have performed well recently. Because the #ACA lost a court battle, and #Insurance stocks dropped today, the market fell hard. #Republicans hate for good health just pushed #stocks below critical levels.
4458 2018-12-18 02:10:51 Is it the time yet to sell the house and buy stocks ? Let me know #Down
4459 2018-12-18 02:10:07 The problem with Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) is that it behaves more like a stock market than actual currency... granted, I'm of the opinion that people should (in theory) be able to use stocks of some kind as money, but the value fluctuates like fuck-only-knows-what.
4460 2018-12-18 02:09:55 Still can't get over that I rope topped, subbed in stocks, and crossed dressed all on Saturday night HALF of it with my plug in
4461 2018-12-18 02:08:32 If dont want to pick stocks, at least look at emerging mkt etfs or even broad us etfs, but average people should be buying something
4462 2018-12-18 02:08:27 I got first production. Thinking dual motor AWD but performance is just too much but I can sell some stocks for it. New tax credit so that’s $15k all together and the cars depreciated only $6-8k with 12k miles
4463 2018-12-18 02:07:27 Stocks to watch:
NMDC: cuts prices of lumps, fines second time this month
Co sues Karnataka over revenue share from Donimalai mine iron ore

Graphite India:

4466 2018-12-18 02:05:04 Nightly Watchlist 12/18:
$MRIN has entered into a three-year revenue sharing agreement with Google. Low volume AHs, watch for possible play.

4470 2018-12-18 02:04:43 Alex-from-the-block is just upset because she doesn’t have enough money to buy stocks.
4471 2018-12-18 02:04:07 I met someone using 2 stocks 3 minutes lol, wtf
what is the general consensus on what people use? i have it set to 3 stocks 7 minutes
4472 2018-12-18 02:03:22 That place is ass backwards. Lobbying by for-profit industry should be illegal. 
Laws that allow Congress to buy/sell stocks that they can influence via legislation is corruption.
4473 2018-12-18 02:02:33 Please stop!!!!  Geez man.  Stocks trade after hours till 8 so there was actual buying of equities unlike overnight moves.  You are scaring the crap out of folks. Just like you falsely represent a fed rhat has always said they were data dependent.
4474 2018-12-18 02:02:16 Moving to companies owning more of their own stocks...a sort of privatization.
4475 2018-12-18 02:01:45 whoops, cause I dont think doing stocks full time = posting 24/7 on twitter and ihub lol .. but whats the point of arguing with a troll, you literally just feed off of it 
4476 2018-12-18 02:01:39 It is a great sentiment indicator. Everyone on today was freaking out about a bear market in stocks. I just laugh and add more long.
4477 2018-12-18 02:01:28 J.Powell moves r very dangerous to health of US markets.  Interest rates going up fast & unloading of Fed balance Sheet adversely affect stocks/Bond Mkt creating huge volatility & promoting R. what is the rush?? hay caramba muy loco Powell is putting at risk @potus economic boom
4478 2018-12-18 01:59:44 You knew stocks were a risk when you bought them. Rule of stock investing. Never buy in stock more than you can afford to lose.
4479 2018-12-18 01:58:03 Oh, I learned. The hard way. Dude side-b'd all 3 of my stocks in the most devastating 3-0 of my life. 
4480 2018-12-18 01:57:30 Stocks crash and cryptocurrencies rise. The beginning of the end or the start of something else? #Crypto
4481 2018-12-18 01:56:48 He’s into bonds. Completely different animal and to him interest rates and fed matter more than it does to stocks.
4482 2018-12-18 01:56:45 All of my stocks were holding up so well until today and then they got the living shit kicked out of them. It makes me want to beat the hell out of someone and cry at the same time. I decided to pet my cat instead.
4483 2018-12-18 01:55:51 Stocks are down in 2018. Under Obama in 8 years up about 300 percent.  Under you we will have 201-k’s
4484 2018-12-18 01:55:17 Which stocks do I have in mind?
4485 2018-12-18 01:54:39 Stocks look pretty bad right now. S&P500 down for the year at this point. Still not a bear market and it will be over by the end of February 2019 so position accordingly. 

<still up 53% for the year
4486 2018-12-18 01:54:12 It’s not like he is going to be buying stocks in his bond fund.
4487 2018-12-18 01:53:48 How about them stocks?!
4488 2018-12-18 01:53:38 Easy-the higher interest rates go the worse stocks perform.eventually people will need to find an asset that goes upward and makes money.the world is in a financial death spiral-same as 10 years ago but magnitudes worse.
4489 2018-12-18 01:53:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Fed rate hikes are extremely rare when stocks are this beat up
4490 2018-12-18 01:51:28 Stocks are falling worldwide. Should we be afraid??? Yep. As long as idiot savant is in the White House sitting behind the Oval Office desk, we should be very afraid of another recession which we are in right now, then a nasty economic depression.
4491 2018-12-18 01:50:05 I continue to see more and more evidence (GE for example) as to why I shouldn’t own individual stocks - but I can’t help it - I love it. But i have no clue what will lead us higher, and that’s terrifying.
4492 2018-12-18 01:50:05 @realDonaldTrump Stocks tanking, 17 investigations closing in, folks fleeing the ship, Mexico refusing to pay for the wall, Congress rebuking your subservience to MBS, N. Korea threatening to stop talks, US losing war in Afghanistan, US isolated..
4493 2018-12-18 01:50:02 Stocks are my life kid. 
4494 2018-12-18 01:49:54 It's down because of uncertainty, and probably correctung itself. Stocks have been overvalued for a while now.
4495 2018-12-18 01:49:44 I’ll buy it once Myers Tire Supply stocks it.
4496 2018-12-18 01:48:59 DJ Jeffries was awesome tonight. 38 points and 5-9 from 3 w/ good stocks. There's questions about DJ's ability to make others better and his mentality, but if he continues to shoot like this and actually tries on defense, he could be one and done. Already advanced offensively.
4497 2018-12-18 01:48:39 @SenJeffMerkley  wants to ban Congress members from owning stocks in order to stop insider trading. This sounds like a good start.
4498 2018-12-18 01:48:38 Been reading a lot of books and yours is next. New to investing with stocks. Started back in August and it’s been down hill since. Trying to be optimistic but man it’s difficult.  This is not fun. 
4499 2018-12-18 01:47:51 A nice juicy tomato.
Fun fact: In history, being put in the stocks could be a brutal death penalty. Imagine having people throw whatever they wanted at your face. For hours. 
Still...
4500 2018-12-18 01:47:35 .@CityPGH Thank you, Mayor Peduto, for your actions against #gunviolence. I, too, believe we need laws banning assault weapons, bump stocks, and armor-piercing ammunition. I believe your courage will serve as an example to others and start a wave.
4501 2018-12-18 01:46:30 Very unlikely. The only way I see 2 stocks being good is if we did sets of 5 or something
4502 2018-12-18 01:45:38 Agree. I would love to see it. He deserves it. Two sitting members of Congress were indicted on felony charges this year. No perp walk. The rules are different for people in power. They really should be put in stocks in the town square for their constituent to throw produce at.

4504 2018-12-18 01:43:40 How is the economy stronger when you have to pay farmers for their loss because you are too stupid to see the consequences of your actions. You are the cause of this problem. BTW speaking of trade, stocks are falling world wide.

We remember 2008
4507 2018-12-18 01:41:44 #Nifty May close positively again on strength of Auto, Metal and Pharma Stocks. 
4508 2018-12-18 01:40:32 Hum can we get an investigation on if they have ownerships or stocks in privately owned prisons? Usually some sort of financial or political disadvantage to our politicians is why the vote no on something like that
4509 2018-12-18 01:40:22 It’s very cheap in qld rations already and interestingly is cheap into central nsw rations, Gil to Moree stocks works at 50/my under wheat into Griffith market. Maybe wheat isn’t too expensive either and actually sorghum is too cheap 
4510 2018-12-18 01:40:10 Fox news saying December on track to be the worst for stocks since the great depression... And the 'competent' Fed Reserve, 'still' considering raising rates- WITH, economic data, that ONLY supports 'lowering', between the two choices.   MEMORIES OF JEFF SESSIONS!
4511 2018-12-18 01:40:05 @realDonaldTrump @gop @SenMajLdr Yo guys and gals. Have you noticed stocks are tanking? Have you noticed stocks under Obama were up like 46%? That under Donnie boy 16%? Your big money corporations and fat cats ain't very happy with ya'all I'll bet.
4512 2018-12-18 01:39:43 Did you ever come across any of these stocks???
4513 2018-12-18 01:39:11 Truth and Carmella doing HQ stuff and push stocks over $100.

4518 2018-12-18 01:35:36 You seem to forget when interest rates go up people pull out of stocks and place money in interest bearing bonds, safer that way.

Obama inflated the stock market with a fake recovery with over $3 trillion dollars everyone seems to have forgotten let alone 0% interest.

4527 2018-12-18 01:31:48 Because if we want it we should be able to have it. It’s a right. And if not for unconstitutional laws, we wouldn’t need bump stocks anyway as we could have select fires. Which btw, are no more deadly than any other firearm. Fudds are not pro 2A!

4528 2018-12-18 01:31:44 Fred it’s coming. I can feel it.  There is a very good case to be made that gold miners will be best performing group of stocks globally in 2019. Never a guarantee.  But set up is best I’ve ever studied.
4529 2018-12-18 01:31:22 $SMRT in a weird area here like all the other stocks due for the reversal but the market just not ready for it to happen
4530 2018-12-18 01:31:19 Ever notice how economic outlook quickly rose when Trump took office? They saw hope of the end of the failure of Obamanomics. Consumer confidence rose, stocks skyrocketing and Obama's "1% grow norm" was immediately debunked.
4531 2018-12-18 01:31:14 I won’t understand how some people play online with 3 stocks and 3 minutes it’s too little time
4532 2018-12-18 01:30:40 Yeah, and sears closing. OSH is Modesto just closed. Home Depot shut down 100 stores and Lowe’s did as well. Stocks have been all over the place. Yeah, recession is coming
4533 2018-12-18 01:30:40 We’re you expecting this bad tax loss season as 10-15 and 20 years low have been achieved . What is the root cause and significance of this gaz  stocks implosion and massacre ?

4539 2018-12-18 01:27:31 Had a guy at work explain to me how trickle down economics helps people. He also told me he thinks people moving money to "safe stocks" right now is dumb when they could be buying riskier stocks cheaper... Trickle down your economics my conservative friend. Trickle them down 
4540 2018-12-18 01:27:04 I checked my stocks Fri. I invested $4500 in 2008 when stock market crashed. This summer they were almost $10,000. Fri they were $7300. SOO much winning!!!! Woohoo! Maga!  There goes that stock market argument for trumpers.....

4543 2018-12-18 01:25:39 Trump derangement syndrome. And the guy who was bearish on stocks emphatically because Clinton was getting impeached was prior example. People are pessimistically  deranged a bit was my take away.

4546 2018-12-18 01:24:33 Look at the bright side: you're probably a net buyer of stocks now, right? Your 401(k) or 403(b) contribution is buying you more shares. It's like a giant sale. You have a few decades to worry about prices going up.

4558 2018-12-18 01:18:14 #trade Global stocks slide as global growth worries deepen

Asian share markets stumbled on Tuesday as heightened concerns about a slowing global economy sent Wall Street stocks skidding to their lowest levels in more than a year. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares…
4559 2018-12-18 01:17:14 Now that all the Corporation tax cuts bought back their stocks the market is correcting the stock values are less than what they paid. Genius.
4560 2018-12-18 01:17:11 listening now
4561 2018-12-18 01:17:06 Stocks always go up in the long term. 

My long term is not the same as my 21 year-old kid’s long term.
4562 2018-12-18 01:16:56 You’re that dumb. THERE ARE NO LOSSES unless the stocks were purchased at exactly the peak this year & sold now, which is a tiny % of stock transactions. All other stock sales will almost certainly have a gain of some sort, possibly very large, attached to them from last 10 years

4574 2018-12-18 01:12:06 Optimism and courage is always part of investing.  The best times for purchasing stocks is when red ink flows in the streets.  It's always been that way. That's why it's so hard to be a successful investor. Every human instinct screams no, don't.
4575 2018-12-18 01:11:11 I bet I get banned from Facebook. But who cares. Their stocks are in the shitter!!!!

4580 2018-12-18 01:08:08 Sorry, but economy is not doing too well. Stocks are in correction, U.S. debt is higher, deficit more than doubled since you took office. It was 430 billion & White House says is expected to hit one ZILLION. Experts say recession coming. Check the facts!
4581 2018-12-18 01:06:53 The best positive indicator for stocks is how negative everyone is. Including me....

4586 2018-12-18 01:03:21 We'll see if the Nasdaq breaks down through support tomorrow otherwise I suspect stocks will come back a bit before the end of the month (before coming back down again)
4587 2018-12-18 01:03:16 I wish we still used stocks in the town square.
4588 2018-12-18 01:02:17 It's my understanding bump stocks are a novelty and not something one would use for accuracy.
There are a ton of unexplained occurrences and conspiracy theories about that mass shooting.
We probably will never know what actually transpired and how it was executed.

4591 2018-12-18 00:59:31 Germany economy is in crisis, they say. In the US, stocks tanked again Monday as fears of the Fed's plans to raise interest rates continue to drive the market down. But healthy economy wouldn't drop 500 points in a day for a simple 1/4% rate hike. Welcome to the next recession?
4592 2018-12-18 00:59:02 Seems like a big crash is coming in stocks with all the debts.

4596 2018-12-18 00:55:16 Excuse me but u didn’t promise to create a “Trade War” when u were elected. You said u knew the smartest & best people including YOU, the master at deal making. Instead we are bailing out farmers because u were unwilling to listen to the experts on trade. Stocks are in the dump!
4597 2018-12-18 00:54:53 First time in my years of trading that I wish I had studied and became  expert in finding good stocks to short   When will the blood stop flowing?
4598 2018-12-18 00:54:13 Hey do you have stocks with Twitter?
4599 2018-12-18 00:53:13 Re investments there are alternatives to buying things like stocks n hoping they go up in price. Think of a rental house if the rental income is good then you just keep it n ignore what you could sell it for. If you buy things for income then all you care about is that.
4600 2018-12-18 00:52:43 Stocks 101
4601 2018-12-18 00:52:32 Speaking of dumps, our economy is becoming a dumpster fire. Stocks are down 7.6% for December, and 5% overall since the famed -- or infamous -- tax cuts. Every time Spanky tweets about the trade war, I have to work another year for my retirement.
4602 2018-12-18 00:51:32  stocks at all time low
4603 2018-12-18 00:50:48 I gotta marry an economics professor to make up for the fact that i barely know what stocks are
4604 2018-12-18 00:50:34 The reason why the stocks are going down daily is b/c the Dems keep screaming their going to impeach Trump when they take over the house.

Fake News MSM-Stop trying sell us it’s Trumps tariffs on China causing it garbage. 

Their rhetoric is crashing the markets & nothing else.
4605 2018-12-18 00:50:05 Ah shit. I didn’t know it was a limited time thing. :(
4606 2018-12-18 00:50:03 This is exactly why when we play, even though I die and you have two stocks left alone, I feel you got the whole game covered, so I just chill
4607 2018-12-18 00:50:02 Would be a grave mistake to buy growth stocks now

4615 2018-12-18 00:45:02 This will really mobilize the millions of non-voters who don’t have enough money to own stocks.
4616 2018-12-18 00:44:42 Did James Cramer suggest selling stock when $es was >2900; answer; no; Cramer like trhe Fed KNOWS NOTHING; he's the Pied Piper of stocks and has buried his listeners!

4622 2018-12-18 00:43:25 All lobbying is illegal. All lobbying is bribery from organizations to our representatives for future favors. You can't get more illegal than that. Except when those representatives purchase stock in those organizations, just prior to the favors, which cause those stocks to rise.

4626 2018-12-18 00:42:30 FED meeting doesn't change anything. They will raise rates because if not yield will tumble and all money will go from stocks to bonds and that will crash the market. This meeting will not change anything about above pattern IMHO.

4631 2018-12-18 00:39:46 US Stocks:  After today, the Russell 2000 (RUT) has officially entered bear market territory.   Thank you, Donald Trump.   Thank you, Wilbur Ross.  Thank you, Peter Navarro.   Thank you, John Bolton.    Thank you, Larry Kudlow.  Make America White Again!
4632 2018-12-18 00:39:16 Small-cap stocks enter bear market, with Russell 2000 benchmark down 20% from highs.
4633 2018-12-18 00:39:06 Stocks will rally tomorrow with J&J leading the pack. They will gap up on Wednesday. Around lunchtime, right before the Fed raises rates, stocks will start selling off hard to 52-week lows. 

But the rate hike should be priced in?
Thanks for the liquidity
4634 2018-12-18 00:38:44 One tip if you ever want to get into stocks... if you ever have a day where you're up 3-5 dollars in the fist hour of the market being open..... DON'T SELL YOUR STOCK when it starts going down. Don't think I'll ever forgive myself for that. lol
4635 2018-12-18 00:38:20 You know what the headlines of #FakeNews CNN & WaPo would be if President Donald Trump was responsible for finding a cure for cancer?:  "Big Pharma stocks crashing and thousands of healthcare & hospice workers and researchers thrown out of work because of Trump!!"
4636 2018-12-18 00:36:49 I’m retired. I’m in stocks and bonds. And I’m pissed. Most of the loss is trade war and instability.  Most of the loss is bc Trump doesn’t know what he’s doing.
4637 2018-12-18 00:36:43 To all you multi-millionaire Republican people who voted for Donald Trump. You're in the midst of a country meltdown. He's out to destroy every major corporation in America take a look at your stocks. That's what you get for voting Trump into office no experience.

4644 2018-12-18 00:34:19 Best decision I made all year was to sell off my stocks once the trade war was announced.

I feel like I'm preforming arbitrage against conservative self-delusion in the financial community.
4645 2018-12-18 00:34:07 With all due respect Mr. Governor, while the Red Flag legislation may help, banning bump stocks and increasing the grace period between purchase and delivery of a gun won’t.

4651 2018-12-18 00:30:36 I am not sure this makes sense. How is «things are getting are worse, but we are hiking today anyway for some reason » a great message? Having said that stocks don’t need any specific reason to bounce.

Dropping ownership level to 5% min changes 1 mo to -6.6% but 3 mo unchanged. Wld have thought 1 mo figure wld be worse.
4680 2018-12-18 00:20:45 You want to sale me some stocks?  give us a favor and don’t be a sales representative anywhere 
4681 2018-12-18 00:20:21 My 401K has 7 fund options and can’t hold individual stocks. What are my options then?
4682 2018-12-18 00:20:20 First we get Navarro then a bond guy killing the market telling us about stocks. How does he earn such airtime? Something doesn’t feel right.
4683 2018-12-18 00:19:44 Please please please KEEP SPENDING TRILLIONS TRUMP YOU'RE GOOD AT IT !  LET ME CHECK MY STOCKS GOP  GDP ?  HOW MUCH ARE YOU GOING TO DONATE 5,000,000,000,euros billion for a bridge in Europe? OR Germany
4684 2018-12-18 00:19:25 Looks like a fast road to Medicare for all to me. Mitch M. screwed up ACA to benefit his pals at Humana in Louisville. Today Health care stocks plunged along with every index because they wont be raking it in any longer thanks to Mitch and GOP sabotaged ACA. The 'BE Best' thing!!
4685 2018-12-18 00:18:54 Agreed. There is every chance the DOW and SPX can still tank from here and will take all U stocks with it regardless of spot price. Will be preserving capital until LT contracts actually start getting signed and we get confirmation of turn
4686 2018-12-18 00:18:53 So it's like buying stocks.
4687 2018-12-18 00:18:49 @AP @Reuters @WSJ FAT CAT DEMs and Anti-Christian JEWS raiding Stocks & Equities in effort to degrade Trump's vibrant economy before most revered holiday for Christians worldwide! Deliberate intent to rupture 401-K plans of people who voted for Trump! LET THE JEWS FUND ISRAEL!

4690 2018-12-18 00:17:44 When the overvalued stocks were hitting high figures, you weren’t crying.  Why not?  Because you borrowed funds to shop the stocks, instead of allowing the companies to generate realistic fundamentals.  Now, rates go high and you have to pay for your mistake.

4692 2018-12-18 00:16:57 Yes stronger, pay no attention to the stocks behind that curtain.
4693 2018-12-18 00:16:29 So when I see ppl saying ppl are going over the top it’s really just like stocks, it’s a correction for things being so screwed up for so long and if you are on the other side of the wrongs done, rather you white on the other side of racism or menthe other side of woman bashing
4694 2018-12-18 00:16:04 Everyone complaining about the market obviously don’t pay attention to gold stocks... fine by me
4695 2018-12-18 00:15:39 Rate hikes should not have anything to do with stocks.  Of stocks fundamentals are inflated and now companies realize their mistake, the guinea pig is now the Fed.  Let’s be serious!!!
4696 2018-12-18 00:15:31 I’m pretty sure I couldn’t have passed it without formal instruction (If even then), I have a disability in math. Lol My only two real careers however were in numbers. Bankruptcy n stocks .
4697 2018-12-18 00:15:25 Been trading $AMZN, $SPY, $TVIX, $JNUG and $NUGT as well as stocks from my watchlist
4698 2018-12-18 00:15:17 Man I took a hit in my stocks today 
4699 2018-12-18 00:14:57 I bet their stocks fell and couldn't afford to buy from them anymore. Haven't we learned anything by now? Those companies only care about money. When they have the money they don't spend it. Why? To keep the good tech, medicine, energy, and so on from the complacent.
4700 2018-12-18 00:14:42 Dow dives 500 points as stocks close near 2018 lows
nice work donald
4701 2018-12-18 00:14:23 #GoldenIdiot Donald Trump will be visiting the markets to throw Band-aids to the traders. Donny will do for stocks what he did for Puerto Rico.
4702 2018-12-18 00:13:51 He knows the Terriffs cause stock markets to crash.  He sold his stocks at a high market value. This is his only purpose for Presidency. Profit. He will resign and re-purchase stocks, cheap, make billions. Catch him, if you can.
4703 2018-12-18 00:13:48 No one likes their stocks dropping as I don’t. I’ve been here let’s see, 7,8,9,plus the minnie corrections 12,15? I never and I said never sold stocks that fell. They all recovered and rose more. Corrections Correct The big players are still in buying. Go look at the numbers.
4704 2018-12-18 00:12:40 Technically G/S/B are wealth...but Elite don't want it that way...that is why its just an insurance. Everything else (stocks, Bonds) are temporary wealth. I am not smart but some smart people can trade it successfully.

4706 2018-12-18 00:10:44 Obama care found unconstitutional so people don't have to by insurance so these money changers sold off insurance stocks plus the Fed chairman hell bent on raising interest rates.  #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump It will all wash out
4707 2018-12-18 00:10:29 Seriously, should not be so heavily invested in stocks if you’re approaching retirement....  portfolios should become more conservative the closer to retirement you are...
4708 2018-12-18 00:09:42 Post close update after updating my charts. Now stocks have clearly taken out the previous levels of resistance and closed a lot lower. Still very cautious with TREND DOWN, FULL HEDGES ON. Be careful out there and enjoy the ride!
4709 2018-12-18 00:09:39 And stocks are on sale NOW!
4710 2018-12-18 00:09:35 My sperm donor bout to talk me to death about these damn stocks yo. I'm outta super focus mode...onto to  personal fun mode. His mia ass gotta chill
4711 2018-12-18 00:09:20 Some good weed stocks on sale hmmm...
4712 2018-12-18 00:09:17 He sold his stocks when they were topped out, under Obama.  I guarantee, when they fall rock bottom, he will resign and buy as much stock as he has cash flow.
4713 2018-12-18 00:09:14 how's the tumblr boycott goin fellas? droppin some stocks? firin some ceos?
4714 2018-12-18 00:08:26 Direct correlation. And they also said they would sell stocks,  even at a loss,  to tank the market to make Trump look bad. Because for them,  hating Trump overrides all concerns. National security,  the economy,  their own paychecks.
4715 2018-12-18 00:08:20 Charles, would it be possible to think that the tremendous drop in the stock market is caused by the left billionaires who have sold their stocks to cause this fall?
4716 2018-12-18 00:05:44 Ik alot of people that do check the rules tho, but I get wym. Even so people are still going in the rules and presetting every set up. They turn hazards off, they turn time on, they turn stocks to 3, and team attack. So what's the problem with turning pause off.
4717 2018-12-18 00:05:19 Yes, he’s doing a great job. Stocks are down, healthcare was never fixed, @realDonaldTrump lies to Americans daily (17 active investigations), & our strongest allies don’t trust us. Hope that Kool-Aid tastes good, because if China makes it, you’ll be paying double soon.
4718 2018-12-18 00:04:40 You know he is bearish on stocks as well. Why don't you offer to bet that btc won't make an all time high in the next ten years. I'm sure you would get many more takers.
4719 2018-12-18 00:03:30 Has anyone checked to see what stocks Trump is buying and selling and timing?

Suspect ultimate insider trading
4720 2018-12-18 00:02:01 Mostly yeah. Stocks. It’s funny how no matter what “charts” say they continue to surprised both ways. Really hope this ain’t beginning of bear market. We need fed rescue
4721 2018-12-18 00:01:50 Just remember, YOU STARTED THE TRADE WAR. Guess they're not so easy to win after all, huh? Hint: No One has Ever won a trade war!  Oh, and if the economy is so great why are so many business laying off employees &/or closing?  Why have the stocks had record setting drops?  Liar.
4722 2018-12-18 00:01:03 ? The correction happens because 1. Trade war
2. Interest rates
3. Overpriced stocks (and the tech stocks were overpriced)
4723 2018-12-18 00:00:59 *ahem* let us not forget the gold stocks. Plot gold stocks vs gold. We are looking at a wicked cheap asset class (below the historical bottom made in 2000). The mean reversion will be spectacular.
