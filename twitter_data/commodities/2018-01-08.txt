53 2018-01-08 21:23:42 Taking big step. Starting  FAGC consulting for commodities.
54 2018-01-08 21:17:55 Yep, I think I'm done with equity indexes, as they've lost their mind. Moving to commodities with real prices based on supply and demand, which can't be perpetually faked.
55 2018-01-08 21:16:06 Commodities..how the sentiment changes after major move price runs. Maybe we get a sell off which would be nice. Esp in copper.

58 2018-01-08 21:08:57 If they can't care for them properly they shouldn't keep animals. Animals are sentient creatures, they are not inanimate commodities. The AWA 2006 puts a duty of care on domestic animal and pets

60 2018-01-08 20:40:44 In addition to being consumers, Neoliberalism grants citizens the significant honor of also being commodities.

62 2018-01-08 20:32:13 I think it was gutted in late 1980s legislation and then gutted again in 1994 Crime Bill. It was dumbest thing ever - unless of course prisoners are commodities that you never want to leave or be employable... (assuming it wasn’t a rhetorical Q!)

64 2018-01-08 20:16:02 Commodities, raw materials, and natural resources will do well, obviously, if the world economy improves—growth will spur a need for them—and they will do well if the economy does not improve, because the government, though it should not, will print more money. #investing

66 2018-01-08 20:02:40 We still have the cabin in the woods, which needs major upgrades/adjustments this year. But I prefer the modern commodities, I rent in the city (pop 10,000) about 45 minutes away.
67 2018-01-08 19:58:03 Totally agree, I hate Goffs Feb sale for this reason (not only that company, but I'm always struck by it at that sale). At some point people need to accept they are animals not commodities, and if they have an early cover they cannot sell at an early sale.
68 2018-01-08 19:47:19 The reason bonds refuse to break is the market  is expecting a bout of weakness with commodities per se such as being seen with cattle since last week.
If long anything be careful.

75 2018-01-08 19:12:34 But relatively little wealth was actually transferred. For that matter, it isn't capitalism because the capital isn't being used to generate any consumable value. Commodities are capital. Equities are capital. Land is capital. Unspendable currency is not.

96 2018-01-08 17:45:01 Bonds are indeed the biggest bubble.  However, ridiculously low bond rates are the foundation for the extreme pricing in ALL other assets including stocks, art, real estate, cryptos, commodities, etc.  If bond market cracks, all others will eventually follow.

98 2018-01-08 17:36:35 The rise in prices will come like an attack on all sides.. from electric bills, transport fees, costs of commodities & services. Now what bullshit are the economic experts trying to make us believe that impact on prices are minimal? How's your math?
99 2018-01-08 17:31:43 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth.. 
100 2018-01-08 17:26:57 The thing about prices of commodities is that we haven’t taken into account the combined impact of a weakening peso and new taxes.
101 2018-01-08 17:23:10 it's simple really. the democrats listen 2 their donors, their donors don't understand human beings b/c they see us as products/commodities. so... collectively, they have no clue as 2 what a average citizen is concerned about. and anything that doesn't make money 4 the rich=bad

103 2018-01-08 17:20:02 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
104 2018-01-08 17:12:47 I recall another period in history where people were treated as commodities. Their lives and futures were also subject to the price tags placed upon them.
105 2018-01-08 17:11:47 Cde , no one has power to control prices except the increase in supply of commodities and expansion of production... Ceteris paribus
106 2018-01-08 17:09:33 Maybe you should come over to Nigeria and taste what it is like to queue up for hours just to buy a  litre of fuel for 250 naira or put up with the encreasing price of commodities daily or better still,  visit some of the communities affected by the Fulani herdsmen crisis.
107 2018-01-08 17:08:38 I laugh when a GM says players aren't commodities, um draft picks and players are the only thing GMs have to trade with, teams cannot sell players for money. Each year it becomes more insane.  I can't help think GM egos also come into play, just my cynical nature

127 2018-01-08 16:09:12 Unemployment rate at lowest since 2000

Minimal rise in wages 

Commodities on an upswing

Markets rallying to all time highs

Crypto investments pouring capital into consumers’ pockets 

Fed to raise rates 3 times in 2018 

Is the economy overheating? What will cool it off?
128 2018-01-08 16:08:15 Advertisements for more apps aren't what teachers need to give more timely feedback and to be better teachers. I hate how it always comes down to $ --Ss aren't commodities.
129 2018-01-08 16:07:52 Aku rasa lotsa things already gone since d 90's, but ppl didnt noticed it.

Not all things that gone r actually 'gone.' It cld b things that we no longer enjoy bc d quality has worsen or paying way above prices. Or, we all hv bcome commodities with diminishin values.
130 2018-01-08 15:59:45 Yes, Andrew, he doesn't seem quite to get that to be the son of a stockbroker who goes to Dulwich College and becomes a commodities trader in the City--however much he hams it up as the cheery lad with a pint at the bar--is hardly slumming it with the hoi-polloi.
131 2018-01-08 15:59:05 and this has not yet taken into account tax they will indirectly pay through increase in taxes in commodities.

146 2018-01-08 15:09:52 Well... good thing people aren’t beholden to your standard of exceptions. Please, LISTEN: your position strips autonomy. Law or not. You are treating us as mere commodities. It’s a problem. You can care for those in need w/ out your false dilemma. Listen to feedback.
147 2018-01-08 15:08:32 Somebody told me that precisely the goal of tax reform is you having the freedom to choose on to or not to spend on commodities affected by it. So since infant formula has sugar, do we say, "I choose to waive my child's right to grow?"
148 2018-01-08 15:06:37 Honest question..  how can raising min wage be all that good for the min wage workers as they say. Most of the everyday commodities we buy are from min wage workers.. meaning those places will have to raise prices to lay workers. Groceries are more expensive..  everything..  1/2
149 2018-01-08 15:06:16 Me, in the middle of sex: *thinking about the overall impact of using human bodies as commodities to satisfy sexual urges*
150 2018-01-08 15:05:48 ANY premise that fosters an ideology of disparaging reproductive autonomy for the betterment of society makes human beings nothing more than commodities. It is a premise that ignores autonomy. It is a premise that presents false dilemma. It’s harmful.
151 2018-01-08 15:04:09 When we come across persons in our lives who possess qualities of fidelity & reliability. No matter what the world sees in you thru ur acts, looks or when u ate in ur had guest moment they will stand by u at any time or situation. They are rare commodities
152 2018-01-08 15:01:45 Yes. Good point, but I was recommending petrochemicals. #Algeria is exporting base commodities, which limits SH's revenue.
153 2018-01-08 15:01:27 Rare commodities are worth more than good
154 2018-01-08 15:00:27 Craig, that simply isn't true. It is widely accepted that Africa has undergone millennia of wealth exploitation from Human Resources (slaves) through to Commodities and Luxuries. Africa is poor because it had its riches removed.
155 2018-01-08 14:56:18 Again: just because you are not advocating for a law doesn’t mean your position is not highly problematic. It feeds same ideology that the laws derive from. We are not commodities. Full stop. It’s not selfish to exercise reproductive autonomy.
156 2018-01-08 14:52:00 Unfortunately, @NatResources refuses to defend our public lands except as oil and gas commodities. Never has an administration attacked our public lands like this. It's a disgrace. Cheers to @patagonia for standing up for all of us!

165 2018-01-08 14:00:48 Hedge funds and speculators remained positive on commodities over the new year, increasing bullish bets in metals and oil.

168 2018-01-08 13:36:05 Those who are against the TRAIN law sucks at math. I mean, c'mon, you're comparing a hefty take home pay against 1% increase in basic commodities. That's downright absurd.
169 2018-01-08 13:34:03 Crash is scheduled undoubtedly... But in crypto commodities, not in Equities...in stock mkts it'll only be healthy corrections
170 2018-01-08 13:30:26 since these $BTC ETFs are NOT backed by any hard commodities at all ...

171 2018-01-08 13:28:29 Will try to post some more charts tonight/this afternoon. Do some ETFs and dig more into inflation themes. Selling hard commodities and buying soft commodities is becoming a very strong theme...

185 2018-01-08 11:44:30 Problem remains, crude is still denominated in dollars. The Petro will inadvertently be linked to the greenback. The world needs a new basis upon which to price commodities, currencies (& even cryptos themselves).

244 2018-01-08 05:30:41 I don't know why anyone pays this guy any mind. Everything that comes out of his mouth on cnbc in regards to commodities is generally wrong.
245 2018-01-08 05:18:40 Bear Paw Development's Paul Tuss on 2018:  
"We want to redouble our efforts to make sure anyone who is out there, who is an agriculture entrepreneur, who has an idea about adding value to their commodities, is given the opportunity to do so."
246 2018-01-08 05:13:55 Our wounds for electrol injustice as Kenyans is still bleeding and with hiking prices on commodities we are far from moving on!!!! #AMLiveNTV

2. Hillary & her friends the McDougals put a Savings & Loan out of business
3. Hillary STOLE $$$ from the W.H travel off.
4. Hillary engaged in Mafia Thug Tactics to silence victims of Bill
5. There's more
249 2018-01-08 04:55:14 With the Power bill of Khs8.1m to be tapped from the innocent consumers n the unga price doubled ,lavy on more commodities to be implemented we should brase ourselves for a tough economical time that we plunged ourselves to by electing thieves in tribal tides.
250 2018-01-08 04:50:50 it’s incredibly reductive to him as a person and artist and it’s so fucking disrespectful like i really want to cry and fight he meant so much to me and i hate how his tragedy is being manipulated into fucjing rt commodities
251 2018-01-08 04:45:23 Prices of several commodities in Zim have gone up but the main challenge is that the salaries of several workers have not also been topped up to go hand in hand with the price hike.Torarama sei muZim
252 2018-01-08 04:35:32 Farmers have written to government to consider lifting a ban on the importation of potatoes and onions this year as the commodities are slowly running out on the market.
253 2018-01-08 04:34:14 Learning more and more that humor is going to be one of those commodities that is going to be hard to come by in these next few years, but hard to enjoy.
254 2018-01-08 04:31:27 Risk/Reward the Mexican Peso is actually a good value here historically at about 20 $MXN to 1 $USD... I think that pair will tighten going forward as U.S. Dollar weakens and #commodities recover.
255 2018-01-08 04:31:03 The increase in basic commodities are really manageable by the rich....not by the masses...
256 2018-01-08 04:27:09 What I find is that Conservatives seem to have little appreciation for the sweep of history. They seem unaware that other commodities in the past boomed and then waned with invention and technological change.
257 2018-01-08 04:19:00 commodities and empathies clashing digitally below deep Einsteins,
 #poetry #science
258 2018-01-08 04:16:42 I wonder if it's a symptom of *growing* commodities/securities that they would exhibit high volatility? My guess is: yes.
259 2018-01-08 04:11:09 They will. They’ve just started. Journalists alive or dead are cheap commodities for them. Didn’t you see how 2 absconders accused in murder of sanatanu in tripura went to bjp office and joined the party. बोलोगे नही तो बुरा हाल होगा

 #poetry #fintech
261 2018-01-08 03:34:49 #TaxBill will be very supportive of #commodities and #cryptocurrencies as companies will look towards #blockchain tech to control inflationary pressures.  Bullish on $POWR $ARN utility coins as well as the commodity complex $GC $HG $CL.
262 2018-01-08 03:33:09 If black money didnt bring,prices of essential  commodities  didnt brought down to cross 2019 will be a walk through thorns and for congress an easy walk through flower laid road.Oratory skill will not help.
263 2018-01-08 03:21:17 Shameless commodities..that's the status of women in Islam.
264 2018-01-08 03:18:14 the infrastructure is for African food and commodities out and Chinese manufactures coming in. Sound familiar?
265 2018-01-08 03:15:03 Geography and local resources dictate the price of commodities. Gas is expensive in Norway because there is no oil in Norway, and it's difficult to import due to its geography.
266 2018-01-08 02:44:12 Hans Goetti: Weaker Dollar To Support Commodities In Emerging Markets
267 2018-01-08 02:44:08 The farmers around me wanted the TPP, planning to sell to Pacific nations. Gone now. Plus, Mexico switched to South American sources for agricultural commodities they used to buy from us, because they were angry about the wall. How does that help farmers?
268 2018-01-08 02:33:11 Per Ricardo:Commodities derive their value from 2 sources, from their scarcity & from the quantity of labor...Only the latter is of interest
269 2018-01-08 02:05:06 3206: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
270 2018-01-08 01:47:53 Palm oil has remained as one of commodities that came under the spotlight in 2017. Indonesia’s top dollar earner, bringing in Rp239 trillion into the treasury in 2019, palm oil has always been a subject of controversy. Here are the five top most popular Palm Oil issues in 2017.
271 2018-01-08 01:44:33 Niche businesses like this can survive price increases because of a loyal following willing to pay more for the same product. When dealing in commodities like a basic coffee and donuts, margins are king and a 32% increase in wage costs demands a more complex solution.
272 2018-01-08 01:38:19 Yeah, looks like commodities + gold will lift off this year.
273 2018-01-08 01:38:12 Oh yeah absolutely. They'll see the main eventers, but more importantly they will find unproven commodities underneath that they love and want to see grow. And by WK13 or WK14, you're adding perhaps another thousand or two Western fly-in fans for Dome shows.
274 2018-01-08 01:21:16 @702Aubrey but Ta Aubza I think our also sisters have the influence in the determining the value of lobola. They tell you (boyfriend) straight hore 'jima papa I don't worth that little' whenever this discussion comes up. So they don't mind at all to be used as commodities.
275 2018-01-08 01:19:47 You don’t need to be an economist to know that increasing prices of fuel is anti-poor & inflationary. So even if you untaxed the low income earners, prices of commodities will go up because of fuel tax. You don’t need to listen to Bam, you just need a little bit of common sense.
276 2018-01-08 01:19:13 There are many who receive monthly welfare checks who also get food stamps plus commodities (groceries) from the government YET young enough to work but spend their check on alcohol living with parent-how is this right?
Enabling is wrong especially when minds are stable to work
277 2018-01-08 01:10:17 #CCP exaggerate efficacy of sending goods by train. From #SupplyChain perspective, it is twice the cost of shipping & more intermodal.  Not good for commodities or innovative products. However can be used on idiots as a Trojan horse. 
278 2018-01-08 00:59:34 Bitcoin has NO INTRINSIC value and is NOT BACKED by commodities or trading. It's a "naked" investment with high risk that demand may collapse at any time without notice. Are you a good market timer?

284 2018-01-08 00:32:57 lrt: he's such an obnoxious piece of shit treating people of another culture as a sideshow spectacle or commodities. Fuck him, I hope he chokes.
285 2018-01-08 00:28:59 Following @JasonChurch has been a real eye opener in terms of tje challenges of shipping commodities on the Great Lakes, especially the last few weeks  Makes me appreciate the whole infrastructure system.
286 2018-01-08 00:27:07 In commodities, the stronger dollar is showing pressure with base metals down, save for Palladium, which remains on a tear. Silver at session lows thus far.
287 2018-01-08 00:15:56 My point is, if ripple went up 100x again, its market cap would be more than all of the dollars in circulation. There's no way that wouldn't crash. It might be a decent small gains investment, but then why would I not just trade commodities and the s&p500, which are stable?
288 2018-01-08 00:13:36 Wearing black in an industry that, as a practice & norm, objectifies women, sees women’s bodies & perceived sex appeal as bigger commodities than their talent, intelligence, professionalism, dignity. I realize #TIMESUP is a campaign but it’s feeling like a fad vs a movement.
289 2018-01-08 00:11:44 Colombia dará un gran salto en materia de innovación el día que deje de depender de los llamados commodities y empiece a hacer tránsito a la tecnología, energías limpias y el respeto por los derechos generacionales y ambientales.
