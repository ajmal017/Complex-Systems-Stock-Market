4 2019-01-30 23:58:16 It was a fun market to play today!  China stocks were pure  if you played it right.
5 2019-01-30 23:57:29 This is a non-issue, as it is a specific term in economics. It's been proven. It was tried. They gave it a chance with reagan. It didnt work. Think of it like this: you can invest in company stocks, it grows the economy. But if nobody buys the product, its still going to fail.
6 2019-01-30 23:57:18 Understand that most of their billions are tied up in stocks and bonds. It’s not like walking around money.
7 2019-01-30 23:57:14 If a hedge fund provided physical security, rule of law, and a safety net, 2% would be a good deal. For monkeys throwing darts at stocks, not a good deal.
8 2019-01-30 23:57:01 It does, I simplify them. They are not at all complicated. Everything you know about trading stocks will help you trade options and everything you learn about trading options will make you a better stock trader

They have a Chinese supplier that has guaranteed prices until 2021. 
Why are Jag so bloody clueless?

13 2019-01-30 23:55:04 No I don't ask to shift the money from skilled employees to law skilled. I'm asking to take it from shareholders. Employers have sometimes so much money but they prefer to buy their own stocks back instead of investing in their employees. Even high skilled employees need raises
14 2019-01-30 23:54:23 Elon Musk should smoke weed again so I can buy Tesla stocks
15 2019-01-30 23:54:07 Forgot the exact first stocks I was trading in college, but Sirius radio was my first expensive lesson. 2k to a college kid is a boat load, especially since this was 20 years ago.
16 2019-01-30 23:52:58 Jail is too light of a sentence for these people! Firing Squad with Bump Stocks with lots of silicone lubricant & hollow points 300 Win Mags

18 2019-01-30 23:51:36 Please do not tie yourself to 30 stocks.  It is like you are wearing a sign.  This whole thing can crumble at any moment.
19 2019-01-30 23:51:21 People who bet against company stocks always use Enron to justify their behavior. Most are comparing apples to oranges. What about the Enron case? Did lawyers win any argument in that case?
