40 2018-01-11 23:57:16 I hate the feeling that I stink or something when i'm clean. My hair needs coconut oil so badly.
41 2018-01-11 23:57:11 What is amazing & brings me to an emotion just beyond frustration i almost loop into apathy, is people okaying an oil pipeline. A spill is a matter of when not how. It's proven unsafe, disastrous, yet everyday people who support are putting blind faith in literally *nothing*.
42 2018-01-11 23:56:52 I'd love to see Chia try to be a little creative. Find a way to sign Patty for a deal and find a willing dance partner for a Lucic trade. Then I'd consider moving either Larsson, Benning, or Klefbom for a PP specialist on D - I'd say Reggie, but I don't think you'd find a taker.
43 2018-01-11 23:56:43 Yes, nobody in this state wants a drill rig polluting our coast. WA State had to fight really hard to keep coal trains out of this state as China was trying to put a coal terminal in WA state for 15-20 years. They finally gave up. Nobody wants more oil, coal or nuclear here!
44 2018-01-11 23:56:43 Why must all oil changes = 30 minutes of everything wrong on your vehicle. If only you could put new tires on your wedding registry....
45 2018-01-11 23:56:38 Regardless of what we individually think oil still drives the economy.
46 2018-01-11 23:56:38  Good one!
47 2018-01-11 23:56:28 Oil supply getting much tighter. Expect $70 wti soon enough. No geopolitical premium currently reflected in wti price. This curve is exactly what opec wants. They sell at spot. USA shale hedges.  More expensive to hedge on a steep backwardated curve.

69 2018-01-11 23:54:09 The dipped delight! It is cucumbers dipped and covered in French onion dip and then if you’re feeling like adding some oil you can deep fry it and the secret ingredient would be that it’s covered in sugar to add a sweetness

135 2018-01-11 23:46:54 Crumbs will pay my oil bill for heat for two months
136 2018-01-11 23:46:49 Who gave you that job sweetie? ??But it still doesn't proup anything until you show what is she saying..... very disappointing @TheHellyShah. So Give oil your own machine 
137 2018-01-11 23:46:39 American companies have no problems exploiting Haitian workers buts its a #Shithole right ?

All those natural resources that American Tech and Big Oil extract from various African countries but its a #Shithole right ?

@realDonaldTrump only shithole is your mouth
138 2018-01-11 23:46:38 But Oil! Oil! Oil!
139 2018-01-11 23:46:38 Norwegians ask why would we want to move to a shithole country like the US? We have free healthcare, childcare, and lots of paid vacation b/c we nationalized the profits of the oil companies. You have Trump and the GOP in power. Enough said.
140 2018-01-11 23:46:25 From what I read about what some oil companies knew about climate change and how long they knew it, the dis-information campaign was ambitious too.
141 2018-01-11 23:46:23 Damn I burnt my thumb trying to take off the oil cap
142 2018-01-11 23:46:16 Could it be ----- on western Canadian  " OIL "  to pay 11.9 BILLION DOLLARS  ( welfare cheques Quebec ).   BC  $ 0.00.   ALTA  $ 0.00   SASK  $ 0.00. ------ maybe time    MAKE WESTERN CANADA a REPUBLIC
143 2018-01-11 23:46:15 Precisely BECAUSE their countries are shitholes is why people flee them. My Cuban and Irish ancestors can attest to that...
144 2018-01-11 23:46:06 hi!
TY
will try oregano oil
willing 2 try anything
need. to. rest.
145 2018-01-11 23:46:01 @RayCronise @pennjillette quick question if you don’t mind. When coming off the potato diet should one slowly introduce vegetables back into the reg eating regiment or could one as long as they are eating nutrient plant based jump into immediate NO salt,oil, sugar meals? Thanks!
146 2018-01-11 23:45:56 Well I only burned myself 3 times while cooking butternut squash in olive oil tonight so that's a win
147 2018-01-11 23:45:38 Lemme get you a bottle of olive oil
148 2018-01-11 23:45:31 snake oil
149 2018-01-11 23:45:28 Oil these bad boys up, you got a show
150 2018-01-11 23:45:27 Obviously the oil companies must have paid them each $20 or so to publish garbage. /s
151 2018-01-11 23:45:20 But Moses hands were delivered unto the colour of a sweet savour unto the hand of the pit, and sold a girl for wine, or oil, or the images.

154 2018-01-11 23:45:08 And an oil pension
155 2018-01-11 23:44:25 なんでふゆはさむいの？
156 2018-01-11 23:44:21 What kinda oil do y’all fry your plantain in?
157 2018-01-11 23:44:18 The pro-business/oil/mining mantra (indeed, dogma) is de-regulation.  Ignore the environment, public health, pollution and climate change.  Pretend all of these real problems are myths. Let the future generations pay for these mistakes--just as we now pay for hurricanes.
158 2018-01-11 23:44:15 It's not oil, but we don't need anymore projects that create the equivalent of 15 coal plants!! #StopJordanCove #NoPCPL #NoLNG #EnvironmentalHealth #GreenFuture @OregonGovBrown @repblumenauer @RonWyden @repgregwalden SAY NO!!! No no no!
159 2018-01-11 23:44:02 Castor oil is the real mvp my eyebrows haven't looked this good in years
160 2018-01-11 23:44:02 My mom really just rubbed some oil on my ankle thinking it's gonna keep me from getting the flu 
161 2018-01-11 23:44:00 Per Keith Schneider, LA Times - words could not be more true: During Trump's 1st yr. - he has guided nation's energy course directly into headwinds of market instability, civic opposition, unstable finance & environmental risk in order to fortify domestic coal & oil industries.
162 2018-01-11 23:43:19 Just put coconut oil in my hair. Feels friggen magical 
163 2018-01-11 23:43:16 With a $1M set aside from their oil  Trust Fund for each man, woman and child + health care. Plus really good cross country skiers and and and Bjornar Haakensmoen!
164 2018-01-11 23:43:04 He won't remember you tweeted this in 2019
165 2018-01-11 23:43:02 Retweeted Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris):

An estimated 3M gallons of crude oil created a massive oil slick on our beautiful shore during the Santa Barbara oil spill. We said we’d never allow this to happen again, yet the Trump Administration wants to expand offshore drilling…
166 2018-01-11 23:42:56 Coconut oil & eucalyptus oil baby.
167 2018-01-11 23:42:50 YAS. I didn't see this article, but I read something last night about it and got excited/hopeful.

did order some CBD oil btw, both vape and non
168 2018-01-11 23:42:42 But funny they still have Off Shore oil rigs ... off-courset hey diversify , we all should think about it .. evolution ..not climate change . And yet they are worried about Climate change the Norwegians, why not shut down the oil rigs?
169 2018-01-11 23:42:37 I’m going to be polite. The reason they leave is because they can’t advance in their county because countries like the United States loot and plunder their industries while the state dept lobbies for American complies to rob then of their natural resources. Ex. Nigerian oil.
170 2018-01-11 23:42:35 I’d say somewhere in between? I never noticed either way because I already have oily skin. That’s a question for someone who doesn’t look like an oil slick 
171 2018-01-11 23:42:35 @jimcramer not only is higher oil not hurting airline stocks, it is not having nearly the effect it should be on energy stocks. It seems crazy that oil can make this run and yet the sector barely moves... people will come around eventually
172 2018-01-11 23:42:19 I am a journalist in Iran 
And suggested to my people to use #save_iranians_in_china 
Can see this now

175 2018-01-11 23:42:14 I biasa guna argan oil je. Beli kat salon capellobynina
176 2018-01-11 23:42:13 Carl, Norway has universal healthcare, amazing infrastructure and a wealth fund that invests oil revenues for citizens - trust me - Norwegians won't be going to the US.
177 2018-01-11 23:42:00 Oooo do you apply the pixi face oil before foundation or what?! Does it work well?
178 2018-01-11 23:41:57 Peak Oil: if you think you can solve the depletion of Crude Oil with lithium ion batteries, than you need a lot of Lithium
179 2018-01-11 23:41:57 Ooh That sounds terribletry some tea tree oil on that inshallah that works and it goes away quicker 
180 2018-01-11 23:41:56 In Norway they still kill whales, 90% are pregnant. They feed fur farm animals the meat. They have just started an execution of the endangered wolf population killing 75% to leave just 12. They are now drilling for oil in the Arctic. They are in the top 3 largest krill harvesters
181 2018-01-11 23:41:51 Had a walk along Aberdeen Bay today with my pup. Counted 16 off shore supply vessels waiting to enter Aberdeen Harbour. Brent Crude is at $70 a barrel oil companies are making profit at $12 a barrel. Scotland makes no profit at any level a barrel. Scotland time to wise up!
182 2018-01-11 23:41:44 5 M
183 2018-01-11 23:41:28 Norway has universal health care, comprehensive social security, the world’s 4th highest per capita GDP,  the largest reserves of oil outside of the Middle East, and ranks 1st on the World Happiness Index. Ain’t none of them wanting to come here.
184 2018-01-11 23:41:12 So @johannhari101 continues his journey from plagiarist to snake oil salesman. His book is dangerous, do not give him or it any credence whatsoever.
185 2018-01-11 23:41:00 Norway doesn’t subsidize oil companies.
186 2018-01-11 23:40:44 They believe in protecting environment while you sold out to big oil
187 2018-01-11 23:40:37 Feel better! 2 Cloves of raw garlic on bread with olive oil a couple of times a day will help.
188 2018-01-11 23:40:15 @nytopinion Mar-a-Lago is right on the ocean! He’s not fooling Floridians by taking Florida off the table. It’s not in his interests to have an oil spill here. He is not fooling us!
189 2018-01-11 23:40:11 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
190 2018-01-11 23:40:08 God wants to put fire in your heart in the secret place, go there! He wants to put peace and joy in you soul, go there! He wants to anoint you with oil, go there! Go and be ravished by His presence in the secret place.
191 2018-01-11 23:39:58 Today's latest trend: huffing gasoline to own the libs. Become dependent on it to keep the oil industry going, that'll show em
192 2018-01-11 23:39:39 Our HIGHEST unemployment-rate right now are 4 % (january) Usually its between 3 - 4 %. But a bit higher due to low price on oil in 2014/2015
193 2018-01-11 23:39:37 凍える
194 2018-01-11 23:39:36 Pre-web, Nigerian prince spam only happened to people in the oil industry. (Mail! On paper! Wif stamps!) Anyway, when a friend's startup got their first one he hung it on the wall right next to the business license, 'cos it showed he was a Real Oilman.
195 2018-01-11 23:39:21 Oil Yes. $GLD depends on JPY. Closer to the top than the bottom. Added $GLD Puts today.
196 2018-01-11 23:39:20 I tried my first oil painting and it was shockingly not horrible!
197 2018-01-11 23:39:19 顔洗ったりしてると手が激寒なんですよね
198 2018-01-11 23:39:18 norway sucks. Its literally covered in ice and spends half the year in darkness. the government pays every citizen with oil money to keep them happy. now they're all a bunch of fat ass cultural studies majors with no skills. fuck that place.
199 2018-01-11 23:39:12 In typical Oilers fashion, trying to trade Slepyshev when he's barely played will get them essentially nothing. Some seem to think Maroon can fetch a 2nd & B level prospect but unless there are a few suitors lined up, a 2nd would be a helluva return.
200 2018-01-11 23:38:30 Joder, aún lo comentaba hoy en la escuela de cocina. "Canola oil" en cualquier receta americana, hasta de alta cocina sin ningún sobresalto.
201 2018-01-11 23:38:29 In 1997 oil prices crashed to record lows, fueling a surge in stock prices through 2000.
202 2018-01-11 23:38:25 Listening to MSNBC on the radio, mention was made that Trump didn't want to see Oil rigs from Mar -a -lago.. Now you know why Florida was forgiven for oil rigging. Wouldn't want to spoil Trump's view.
203 2018-01-11 23:38:23 It’s not steroids.  These are injections of oil into their muscles.  It’s a fad among middle eastern men, Brazilian as well.  You don’t find many in NA doing this, but there are examples
204 2018-01-11 23:38:23 We were having so much fun. I even went as far as calling The President an ass. America was built on fantasy religions, snake oil salesmen, circuses and Disney.. reality show performers and actors become President and now everyone loves Oprah! We must be entertained!
205 2018-01-11 23:38:22 Hi @realDonaldTrump Shithole-creator in chief. 
US regime-changing foreign policy - over 50 changes so far - creates "shit-holes" out of functioning, autonomous nations just to feed US "strategic interests"; your economy's oil dependency and your arms manufacturers' profits.
206 2018-01-11 23:38:19 Thanks oil 5p-

Tea Tree it. 
Massage oil too slick?
TEA. TREE. IT.
212 2018-01-11 23:37:07 So close to “getting it”!!!
“So those folks from war-torn countries, ravaged by a despot trying to fill the vacuum left from when we half-arsedly toppled the last one just to get a bit of oil & now their kids live under daily threat of being killed. Why do we let them in?” #fail
213 2018-01-11 23:36:52 Midnight oil ist seltsam.
214 2018-01-11 23:36:50 What about mouth sucklin’ oil?
215 2018-01-11 23:36:41 Norway has oil.
216 2018-01-11 23:36:41 I am not sure I agree with that part, but Israel surely joined the criminal club in 1967. But KSA is the one who is making sure oil is sold in US-dollars. I am sure they have a lot of influence, but did they control Dick Cheney's mind?
217 2018-01-11 23:36:37 We absolutly do NOT need oil on our beaches. WTF is wrong with these people???
218 2018-01-11 23:36:34 So agree - join a class > I'm a prof artist & I teach #Oil #painting in W5 #Tuesdays > full for this term but enroll (online) now for the #Summer term at the #EAL website
219 2018-01-11 23:36:25 Sorry about ur ear tho. .  Maybe warm sweet oil then cotton ball. 
220 2018-01-11 23:36:23 Next time, oil up a little before you use the syrup-base. It will save your skin, and time when you clean up. Cuz that shit hurts!
221 2018-01-11 23:36:20 We can.
Also Lit can be made into an oil paint...
222 2018-01-11 23:36:16 I really been eating clean asf like no butter is in my house only coconut oil and 100% virgin olive oil and my food slaps
223 2018-01-11 23:36:15 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
224 2018-01-11 23:36:06 I would have though you preferred motor oil and radiator fluid.
225 2018-01-11 23:35:51 After MONTHS of putting it off, I’m finally adulting and getting my oil changed today 
226 2018-01-11 23:35:50 Thanks to increasing oil prices all those tax credits will be flowing right  into BIG OIL!! Middle Class will be crapped on again.
227 2018-01-11 23:35:49 Definitely worth it customers over the moon , took 40 minutes plus prep all four coats, got to learn to manage your time better I think!!!! Better than breathing in that oil based shite all day me thinks, chuck you’re trade20 in the bin, w/b the way forward 
228 2018-01-11 23:35:41 You get Budweiser in Canada?

230 2018-01-11 23:35:41 Apple-Enthusiasts rejoice! The new iPhone will be resistant against Burger King fryer oil!
231 2018-01-11 23:35:41 So why do we need oil from ANWAR again?  Sell-out.
232 2018-01-11 23:35:37 In the context of  Russia it is usually set me super rich oil/gas/banking person closely connected to the Russian/Putin regime.
233 2018-01-11 23:35:32 In what way? Yes, there's an oil rig, it's still there, check.
234 2018-01-11 23:35:03 I'm fine with either but would rather he play with McDavid
235 2018-01-11 23:34:58 People sleep on oil diffusers honestly they’re amazing
236 2018-01-11 23:34:56 I love these broad brush statements.. Most 'African Nations'  are less fortunate because of repressive Colonial White people, be it English, French or in later years American (certainly in the case if they had oil)
237 2018-01-11 23:34:50 If you were hoping to buy some crude oil, it will now set you back $70 a barrel, highest for three years.
238 2018-01-11 23:34:47 I’m making castor oil from scratch, coconut oil from scratch, bout to grow aloe Vera ... PLEASE KNOW WE ARE ON THE COME UP 2018

243 2018-01-11 23:34:20 realllllllyyy need an oil change & inspection sticker but i work a double tomorrow 
244 2018-01-11 23:34:18 In the early 1900s, Cordova was a port for copper ore and now it's main economy is commercial fishing. To our north, Valdez is a port for the oil pipeline.
245 2018-01-11 23:34:16 You should evolve and become one with your hand.  Get a fucking sock and baby oil!
246 2018-01-11 23:34:08 I'm looking at battered oil weighted w/ strong yoy growth only. Haven't followed your list but do know $Pxt held up best on Tsx last year.
247 2018-01-11 23:34:04 wooo wee about to go pickup a rare early 2000s Ness oil pressure gauge
248 2018-01-11 23:33:40 Good questions and good points Rob @Oil_Drop - what are your opinions on what they should do next? If Patty goes, what are we looking for in return? Knowing Slepy is on the block, do you think there are some dance partners?
249 2018-01-11 23:33:39 Now you need to see Robert Chafe's, "Oil and Water"! Another incredible story. Look it up, Lin!
250 2018-01-11 23:33:36 Norway was considered a shithole backwards red neck country until they found oil...
251 2018-01-11 23:33:30 So is the delay for #NROL47 being caused by the seventh fetzer valve? Prepare it with some 3-in-1 oil and some gauze pads, and they're going to need about ten quarts of antifreeze. #fletch
252 2018-01-11 23:33:26 I just realized that everything I use on my body is coconut oil based.. I think I might have a problem lol
253 2018-01-11 23:33:17 My wife is willing to try CBD oil for herself! Does anyone have a suggestions and or sample she can try to see how it hits her?
254 2018-01-11 23:33:13 No im just talking about they have oil and they still explore they´re reserves , funny , the prime minister only talked about renewable energies..why?
255 2018-01-11 23:33:00 Turkey and American cheese toasted on a white sub with lettuce, tomato, red onions, mustard, mayo, oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. I’m a kid lol
256 2018-01-11 23:32:59 45 said that countries with black people are shithole countries and that we should be taking in people from Norway. You obviously haven't been to Anchorage lately, as you would know diversity is a huge part of Alaska's success. You shook hands with a white supremacist for oil $$$
257 2018-01-11 23:32:58 That whole crowd were a blight - a 40 year blight at that - no real plan because, heck, we’ve got a big fat pay cheq from oil - yay!
258 2018-01-11 23:32:58 We brush it with a little olive oil and it gets nice and crisp
259 2018-01-11 23:32:51 Im just tired and numb of the daily embarrassment this mentality unstable racist who snake oil salesman’ed his way into office continuing to show zero compassion, ruin this country, and if u voted for Trump because u hated Hillary or having a woman as president then shame on you
260 2018-01-11 23:32:51 #save_iranians_in_china 
No news, good or bad, yet. Worried parents, spouses and children, await at the tragic explosion of the Iranian oil tanker in Chinese waters.
261 2018-01-11 23:32:35 Tell Sessions to stay out of state laws regarding marijuana, he's violating the 10th amendment of state rights. Marijuana is good for medicine, clothes, oil and gas; which means better economy. By the way, people in Norway don't like you.
262 2018-01-11 23:32:29 COT is for ST use only, not LT trends. Oil got hammered in Oct 2000 – Nov 2001 due to the dotcom bust and subsequent short recession. Then again Jul 2008 – Feb 2009 during the GFC. And Jun 2014 – Feb 2016 when global economy slowed and $ soared. Crisis coming in 2018 imho, oil 
263 2018-01-11 23:32:25 Norway is very capitalist, and filthy rich from oil. But with a solid welfare state as well.
264 2018-01-11 23:32:22 I only want artwork from countries like France. Who would want artwork from holes like Australia or New Zealand. They have no concept of oil painting
265 2018-01-11 23:32:18 Well we didn’t after 9/11 and we didn’t after the financial sector crashed and we didn’t after oil shot to $147/bbl so I think it’s a pretty safe bet
266 2018-01-11 23:32:10 Where's that? I went somewhere far af in NC. I think that's the place. With a temp service. Mfs made us climb in oil pipes without a uniform. 
267 2018-01-11 23:32:05 Oh... coconut oil moisturizer, sorry, it's actually kinda dull :(
268 2018-01-11 23:32:05 My car gone get a wash when i go get an oil change .
269 2018-01-11 23:32:02 @CNN Pipe down. Real people are talking about the real world. 
Not land of Unicorns and rainbows.
270 2018-01-11 23:31:48 Have you tried cbd oil?
271 2018-01-11 23:31:44 Nothing beats fresh oil in the fryer.
272 2018-01-11 23:31:18 Encourage yourself , i need the oil , i told the storm
273 2018-01-11 23:31:03 Self-serving, knee-jerk responses - that was Conservative ‘planning.’ Their only real plan was to mindless plod along spending like drunken fools. Where’s Alberta’s oil revenues from those heady days? And then look to where Norway’s money was invested/saved.
274 2018-01-11 23:31:03 Indeed- we had the 1 L excess oil solution others suggested when I was in grad school. Worked fine if you were paying attention. Good luck finding a solution!
275 2018-01-11 23:31:01 @cltomlinson When all the regulation laws , rules and liability are settled about driverless vehicles and catch on and in service driverless vehicle carmakers and the suppliers stock will be the new Hot Stock over oil Stock.
276 2018-01-11 23:30:55 We would have had ~ 20 mL oil, with capacity in the upper section to contain that. We replaced our mercury manometers with pressure gauges long ago.
277 2018-01-11 23:30:46 Stir together 1/3 cup cake with 9 tsps carrots. Mix into  Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve warm.
278 2018-01-11 23:30:45 Will Trump be open for making a deal with these countries? They might have oil, minerals - and his sons like hunting big game there...

280 2018-01-11 23:30:38 use coconut oil and let that just sit in your mouth for 10 minutes then spit it out i swear it works wonders
281 2018-01-11 23:30:33 I expect "we should invade and take their oil" will show up at some point.
282 2018-01-11 23:30:32 I’ve taken economics classes. What you just spouted is laughable.

The real bottom line is that anyone who’s cool with tax dollars subsidizing huge agribusiness or the oil industry but thinks we can’t spare tiny fractions of those sums for human beings is just a Grade A d*ck.
283 2018-01-11 23:30:22 Drop some #oil in my joint and make a song ...


284 2018-01-11 23:29:53 Corporate tax cuts not small business. I'm speaking of multi million & billion dollar companies. Banks, Oil & Gas, Pharmaceutical, Real Estate Developers. No matter how you view it the small person will be stuck paying the tab

286 2018-01-11 23:29:25 We:re making powerful enemies for NY .. for temporary gains. Today it all sounds good as a headline but years from now this city may pay dearly for these temporary gains. We will need oil and gas for as long as we have a city... what we do today may cost us tomorrow.
287 2018-01-11 23:29:22 fumin at maccies for lying about their oil and having tallow in their chips
288 2018-01-11 23:29:00 Hope big oil sues his sorry but back. Oh who’s paying lawyer fees???
289 2018-01-11 23:28:51 Yeah I just put herbs in, cover with oil, and sit it for a bit. If it goes longer than 3 days you have to be a bit gentler with it so the oil doesn't go stale. But it gives it a good kick. Same goes for infused spirits, if you drink ;-) 3 days is about good.
290 2018-01-11 23:28:49 This is how, in MX, we lost our national telephone company, sold to Slim for cheap, it's how we lost our mines,our wood, salt,beaches, right now loosing oil and public education. This is why I am worried, I have been seeing this shit going on since I was child,there now here too.
291 2018-01-11 23:28:44 Do believe it's because the #WhiteHouseInterloper doesn't want his pristine beach front Florida properties tarnished by the next likely oil spill disaster now that the #EnvironmentalPillagingAgency repealed all those unnecessary rules
292 2018-01-11 23:28:39 Or windmills if oil is of insufficient quantity.
293 2018-01-11 23:28:39 @iRacing I never thought this day would come but it did you’ve officially simulated driving in oil with one trash tire model and you can’t say it’s realistic because you don’t spin out going 20 mph on a pace lap good job guys.
294 2018-01-11 23:28:31 make sure its legit cbd.  lots of fake oil on the market.

My hair is natural and I know how this feels
297 2018-01-11 23:27:54 But there's isn't Russian oil money so it's alright... or something along those lines. Anyway European Cup > positive net spend and anyone who argues otherwise is nonce
298 2018-01-11 23:27:42 In two words? FIRE #CHIARELLI!
299 2018-01-11 23:27:32 I actually try to cook everything with olive oil. Extra virgin. Butter makes good toasts but everything gets heavier in my stomach

303 2018-01-11 23:26:51 You mean the kind of disaster that could happen from an oil spill?
304 2018-01-11 23:26:47 Yep heard those words today. New talking points for mouth breathers.
305 2018-01-11 23:26:42 Norway is not a typical country. Their oil reserves make them hugely rich. Their sovereign wealth fund, which derives from oil revenue, is worth $200k per capital. Try UK, or Italy, for more meaningful analogy.
306 2018-01-11 23:26:24 A few times over. I don’t know if he’s married now. I’m just imagining if one was. Like what would you say lol.

308 2018-01-11 23:25:55 Tonight's irritating mystery - how exactly do you prepare oil of tartar for alchemical use?
309 2018-01-11 23:25:52 These arms are oil 
310 2018-01-11 23:25:39 Maybe they could name it oil spill.
311 2018-01-11 23:25:33 I love you baby coco, looks are only superficial, all you need to do right now is get through this, and then your eyebrows and hair will start to grow. Keep in mind castor oil is very good for growing hair ((but can be super drying on sensitive skin)) ily bby, you are beautiful.
312 2018-01-11 23:25:23 Nah, it literally has a litre reservoir on top, so if you were backfilling something huge, it would just suck the oil up into the reservoir, and then it would get pushed back down. That said, the bead check valves are probably cheaper than a litre of oil and work well.
313 2018-01-11 23:25:07 oh yeah I’m gone ... you can’t be always staining my shirt with oil 
314 2018-01-11 23:24:59 bitchhhhhhh miceller water, coconut oil, witch hazel, and vitamin e serum 
315 2018-01-11 23:24:58 Level 2 is an essential oil diffuser be warned
316 2018-01-11 23:24:36 I can remember a couple of years ago when choosing my fresh fruit and veg in either Tesco or Sainsbury’s I got funny looks and asked could I use the bags provided to put my wares in....... never had and never will 
All this plastic is only lining the pockets of oil barons
317 2018-01-11 23:24:32 @jimcramer airlines $DAL $UAL $AMR are up because nobody believes this Aramco-engineered spike in oil prices which will surely tank after the IPO.  MANIPULATION.
318 2018-01-11 23:24:25 Attention, idiot! We are 5+ million, nearly homogeneous, with a shit-ton of oil. Spend waaay less on defense because we're not the world power.. We're also very rich on hydro power and fish..We also don't have 19 intelligence agencies investigating fake Russia fairytales...
319 2018-01-11 23:24:16 Coconut oil is the shit
320 2018-01-11 23:24:13 how can i eat good when they have bread and oil at work 
321 2018-01-11 23:24:08 Attaboy, never stop learning. How long did you infuse your oil? I usually sit mine for 3 or more days.
322 2018-01-11 23:24:07 Just a matter of time till you’re standing in the unemployment line looking for a handout. Oil is a dying industry
323 2018-01-11 23:24:00 I found out its cuz i have synthetic oil smh
324 2018-01-11 23:23:45 They don’t think the oil, diamonds, and all the other precious minerals they steal from Africa is shit.
325 2018-01-11 23:23:41 As another local WA voice, we support @PattyMurray’s stem end and sentiment. We will fight all the way to keep our shores as clean as possible and oil FREE
326 2018-01-11 23:23:29 Maybe Trump thinks there's such a thing as clean coal and clean oil because he's laundering money through an Oil company? #TYTLive

330 2018-01-11 23:23:13 I sincerely hate the smell of motor oil
331 2018-01-11 23:23:12 The West didn't think Africa was full of "Sh**hole countries" when they were busy carving up and raping the continent of its PEOPLE, oil, diamonds, cocoa, ivory, and so many other precious natural resources. #Africa #Haiti #BlackPride
332 2018-01-11 23:23:05 Please talk to SC Gov to let SC voters decide to explore our coast for natural gas/oil and have a debate of how to go forward once all the facts are in instead of shutting it down without us having a say.....Thank you
333 2018-01-11 23:22:47 My dog was super proud for having barked enough at the oil delivery guy that he drove away after filling the tank. (AKA she had no impact.)
334 2018-01-11 23:22:37 Irony was Trump didn't even want you to buy the snake oil, it was all supposed to be a scam to promote his otter cream. #TYTLive

336 2018-01-11 23:22:15 Oil is over $64 a barrel.  Guess what?  all that extra money will go up in gas to get to work.  #dumb as a rock #GOP = #losers #MAGA
337 2018-01-11 23:22:13 That's because our Josh has so much talent. From being a talented streamer to being talented at the games he's passionate about. Continue that passion "Oil Tot"!
338 2018-01-11 23:21:59 If Jose was as defeatist as some Utd fans on here we would be fucked! Luckily he isn't and he will find a way to compete with the oil merchants ! If sanchez signs for shitty we move on ! Any player or "fan" who doesn't respect our history can do one !
339 2018-01-11 23:21:58 Klein was directly responsible for our orphan wells and abandoned resource sites. He relaxed rules and made creditors the first priority with failed oil companies. Environmental issues came last. After money was gone.
340 2018-01-11 23:21:50 but...gold coated baby formula turbo ion charged by lithium batteries is what the chinese babys need! NOT OIL
341 2018-01-11 23:20:59 Automation is just a personal example of what I see as the greatest reason that capitalism will inevitably be replaced. Another example could be the need for action against climate change being largely blocked by the oil and gas industry, specifically for profit's sake.

375 2018-01-11 23:17:05 I really like the Embryolisse Lait-Creme Concentre! It also doubles as a primer and makeup remover. On really dry days, I'll add 2-3 drops of argan oil too :)

378 2018-01-11 23:16:55 My hair so soft since I washed it. That coconut oil conditioner did its job.
379 2018-01-11 23:16:50 Sooooo....why would they immigrate to USA then? Why don't the educated citizens stay there to better their country?  Perhaps because its a 3rd world nation, despite huge oil reserves?  I believe the colloquial term for that is....shithole.
380 2018-01-11 23:16:46 That’s how I feel every time I wash my hair. Also these edges!! I’m trying to save them as much as I can. Black Jamaican Castor Oil and I arw great friends.

390 2018-01-11 23:15:41 Also, the oil industry
391 2018-01-11 23:15:35 No one gilded their pockets better than the PCs - Klein sold off public assets to pay off PC debt when oil had a GOOD name. They laughed all the way to the bank; their buddies scooped up the power grid; in effect, we’re STILL paying the PCs via our household’s electricity bills.
392 2018-01-11 23:15:28 Hopefully the NYC lawsuit against the oil companies is successful and other multinational giants think twice before fucking us all over for profit.  Looking at you big pharma, there's a lot of cost associated with rampant opiate addiction #tytlive

423 2018-01-11 23:12:27 Someone please tell this idiot POTUS that all of the most values resources come from Africa., like diamonds, gold, oil and many more, not to mention that is where humankind began.
424 2018-01-11 23:12:19 Looks to me like Norway is coming down off that oil bubble
425 2018-01-11 23:11:59 Because of the fur trade actually. It was the “oil industry” equivalent of the time. Have you seen Frontier? Messed up stuff. 
426 2018-01-11 23:11:52 Blaming oil companies for global warming while everycunt continues to consume, pollute and use oil everyday. These companies are being made a scapegoat of.
427 2018-01-11 23:11:16 "Can" of chew? Chew comes in pouches; snuff comes in cans!

Seriously, though, buying Skoal off-base when I was in New York was setting myself up for sticker shock, and that was over a decade ago. Even the northern US trips me out.

430 2018-01-11 23:10:59 I paid $36 for a car wash today and got an oil change. If that's not adulting, I don't know what is. K could've had all the nugs with that money

432 2018-01-11 23:10:50 "To ensure the safety of everyone". Right.
RCMP have always been in thrall to their oil-and-gas masters, prowling parking lots and recording licence-plate numbers of Albertans who dared attend public anti-fracking lectures, later pulling them over for taillight infractions, etc.
433 2018-01-11 23:10:44 今日の2限目権利擁護だった…
434 2018-01-11 23:10:41 #tytlive I mean, I like the idea of trying to hold oil companies and others to account for climate change but I have zero faith in our broken political and justice system these companies will be even slightly held to account for what they've done.
435 2018-01-11 23:10:34 If oil subsidies were done away with Tesla would take over the auto industry faster than they already are
436 2018-01-11 23:10:32 All oil, gasoline, and natural gas should be diverted away from NYC. All powerlines to the city should be cut. That way DiBozo cam show everyone how green NYC is.

438 2018-01-11 23:10:21 11%? That's being extremely kind to the Oil Companies. I'd be inclined to blame them for 65% #TYTLIve

443 2018-01-11 23:09:53 Finally getting an oil change for my baby 
444 2018-01-11 23:09:52 Interesting. I guess I've just got used to have a bit more overpressure. Some kind of non-return valve is critical, though because a litre of oil in your vac line… yikes.
445 2018-01-11 23:09:49 Chilli oil is a great thing but I feel like I need a designated spoon for it because it stains everything to holy hell and is impossible to clean
446 2018-01-11 23:09:48 Cause big oil will do anything to smear Musk and Tesla. Latest angle: the metoo movement.
447 2018-01-11 23:09:46 bio oil, girl!!!!! it’s in a white outside box but the stuff itself is in a tall, skinny, orangish bottle. you can get it at Walmart!!! everyone in my family has used it and it makes your skin so soft too, so that’s a plus :)
448 2018-01-11 23:09:40 @chuckwoolery @realDonaldTrump @MarkSimoneNY @AnnCoulter @LouDobbs @larryelder @RealJamesWoods @IngrahamAngle Mayor De Blasio  filed law suit against major oil companies for polluting NYC. Easy cure is for the oil companies to stop shipping oil into city. That will help economy.

469 2018-01-11 23:06:01 We don’t want off shore oil. We don’t want dependency on oil but towards alternative energies. 
Also Trump needs to stop influencing the investigation by speaking about it.Any other president had spoken same  way they would had been impeached n tossed out. 
He must testify Muller

479 2018-01-11 23:05:01 The irony of all this shithole stuff is that Norway's affluence is very recent - they only found mass offshore oil deposits in the early 1960s.

493 2018-01-11 23:03:27 A billionaire asked to write about inspiration....how inspirational are those BIG OIL contracts you're apart of in Syria Golan? When was the last time you were 'inspired' by the Israeli apartheid?
494 2018-01-11 23:03:18 My question is:

Why is all the environmentalist rage directed at domestic oil production, but never at imports? Every BBL not produced here is imported.

499 2018-01-11 23:02:45 HYSY981 isn’t a Vietnamese oil rig, it’s Chinese CNOOC’s. I’ve kept track of developments in the run-up to the standoff, and the Chinese move came after BJ complained about the OVL-PetroVietnam deals. It’s therefore not hard to see what led to the standoff.

531 2018-01-11 22:59:01 To put it simply, I am all for green energy. That said, if it is not balanced with the defluctuation of the oil and coal economic blocks....we will see mass economic instability and perhaps even collapse.
532 2018-01-11 22:58:57 The guy at the car shop talking to my mom while she is getting her oil changed is complaining about refugees and saying if they feel like they’re oppressed to pick up a gun and do something about it.. my mom is currently digging her phone in to my side so I won’t say anything

536 2018-01-11 22:58:22 If you have never traveled to some of these countries it is hard to understand what shitholes they are. Socialism is a disease that turns oil rich countries into shitholes while keeping the general population uneducated and poor.

539 2018-01-11 22:58:17 the word is that Big Oil will use some of their tax cut billions to gear up for some acquisitions this year in the energy patch...most of the deals will probably be in the $20 to $50 billion dlr. variety..cheaper to buy proven reserves than to drill for it..#OIL
540 2018-01-11 22:58:13 Trump and cronies WANT THAT OIL!! By what right does US remain in Syria? Did Assad request this "forced occupation"? They can't chase Assad out. They can't outright KILL him. So, they'll just camp-out, UNINVITED, in a SOVEREIGN nation! George Soros is getting what he wants.

556 2018-01-11 22:55:42 That's the bergamot oil and sicilian lemon oil working it's wonderful magic.  Thanks for sharing the Lush love! 
557 2018-01-11 22:55:34 I used to use tea trea oil religiously I don't know why I stopped 
558 2018-01-11 22:55:29 Residents would agree. That's why they flee.
559 2018-01-11 22:55:25 and heating oil is the only thing keeping some of his residents alive
560 2018-01-11 22:55:24 Charles omits that yield figures never include inputs. Putting aside considerable ecological cost true yield is simple - output minus input. Critical inputs are fast-diminishing phosphate & nitrogen fixed by equivalent energy (oil, coal, hydro) - competing with other demands...

563 2018-01-11 22:54:43 Thank you Mari - I love drawing with oil pastels :)
564 2018-01-11 22:54:30 There is enough oil inland. And it is cheaper to get it out and move it than from offshore prospects.
565 2018-01-11 22:54:28 Goto Names that are well known would be my first choice in the early oil bull rush. $Cpg and $Bte are two great choices with lots of upside

567 2018-01-11 22:54:15 I've just had my go-to snack of raw naked chocolate digestives washed down with a fresh warm snake oil infusion topped with micro BS seeds... yum
568 2018-01-11 22:54:11 no alarms went off on the day of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion because they'd been disabled to spare workers from being woken up by false alarms.
569 2018-01-11 22:54:10 Why do we need off-shore oil pipelines? With Keystone pipeline open & Alaskan North Slope producing in the near future, we should have enough oil to last a 100 years. Wind energy & natural gas will complete the picture. Vote against greedy oil companies & off-shore oil.

No mention of this was ever mentioned by any Congressman or Republican member while in the voting process
577 2018-01-11 22:53:08 Ahhhhhhhh....you mean because bush and obama saved us after the big crash and the american people saved themselve,s by working 70 hours a week and getting a second job.   Trump is a snake oil salesman and history will show him for what he is...a buffoon.
578 2018-01-11 22:52:57 idk bout that but try coconut oil instead of cream.
579 2018-01-11 22:52:53 There’s not a hope in hell of WM giving up oil revenue while Scotland is part of UK. Why do you think they don’t want Scotland to leave? It’s not because of our charming wit!
580 2018-01-11 22:52:44 While Obama was in office I received a raise and a bonus annually, since Trump was elected, not a raise, nor a bonus. I'm in Oil and Gas.  Now tell me again about all this $$$ coming my way.

590 2018-01-11 22:51:28 Lmao I pulled up to eat somewhere bc thanks to my oil change taking forever, I had to go somewhere quick. Realized I pulled up to the place that had a huge kitchen fire and won’t be open for a few more weeks
591 2018-01-11 22:51:27 NB The limit for IOPC Funds payout is USD $1.5 billion, which would cover a fraction of the cost of the #ExxonValdez oil spill cleanup in Alaska. Canadian taxpayers would be on the hook for anything over and above this amount.

597 2018-01-11 22:51:10 Are you saying oil production in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria or Iran causes less harm to the Earth than oil production in US?

Or do you just prefer to take jobs from American workers to enrich foreign dictators?
598 2018-01-11 22:51:06 How many of those shithole countries did  those diamonds his wives and daughters wear come from.  How about the oil and gold they steal from them as well. A flat out racist.
599 2018-01-11 22:51:01 Oil wrestling?
600 2018-01-11 22:50:43 You basically warm it up on your fingers and then tap it into your skin. It’s described as a liquid blotting paper   So you can even put it on during the day to get rid of oil
601 2018-01-11 22:50:40 I remember what happened with Deepwater Horizon and BP back in 2010, and the massive oil spill that resulted from it. That should have been the end off shore drilling completely.
602 2018-01-11 22:50:37 I recall nearly every broker forecasting a sub $40 oil price heading into 2018... think I'd stick to throwing darts  
603 2018-01-11 22:50:17 A haircut+hot oil was well needed

628 2018-01-11 22:48:08 Oil drilling! Maybe add pix of oil drilling on the beach. Unsure of his plans for same, who cares they play dirty!
629 2018-01-11 22:47:45 If the oil rigs used windmills to draw the oil up he’d be all in for them. The windmill advocates misjudged how to deal with the accidental bird deaths they cause, they would have been a plus for this sorry bunch.
630 2018-01-11 22:47:41 im feelin hella spicee right now bc this oil change has taken 3 fucking hours so if you wanna try me let's go

642 2018-01-11 22:46:26 That is true my friend, that is true. And they also have oil don't they?
643 2018-01-11 22:46:10 No oil drilling off of the coast of California or anywhere please! Even the oil industry is transitioning to renewable energy away from fossil fuels. The oil industry know the future & know what affects their bottom-line. The Trump administration doesn’t see the future well.
644 2018-01-11 22:45:42 It is not clear from my Tweet, the sin of omission, that I was not not advocating refusing medical help. I fully expected to be having Chemo in the early new year.

649 2018-01-11 22:45:30 Have to agree: he could at least chop 50% of the car lanes out of New York (with near zero difference to 95% of people). Not much point encouraging everyone consume oil, then blame the producer.

682 2018-01-11 22:41:17 So I was walking through Walmart with a bottle of soap, teriyaki sauce, and olive oil. A man that passed by me says “That stuff will get ya buzzed... ” 

I’m not sure which bottle looked like alcohol but I’m interested how my teriyaki chicken and next shower might make me feel.
683 2018-01-11 22:41:05 I say this without a sneer: must be pretty sweet to have the entire country in early retirement from the oil trust.

696 2018-01-11 22:40:09 My bad day turned around real quick, my car is fine and I just have to get oil changes sooner than normal, the dealership rotated my tires for free, my mom filled up my gas tank, and amazon is refunding me for something but not making me send the item back 
697 2018-01-11 22:40:01 Good weasel, but you categorically stated that if the Scottish Government is squandering oil revenues, don’t support them. Clearly you don’t have a clue what you’re talking about.
698 2018-01-11 22:39:46 you know what i did suck it linda. i sucked all the coconut oil out of your husband last night
699 2018-01-11 22:39:42 It's PB but also other stuff?? This came from a tofu recipe and we have used it on a ton of stuff since then, it's very flavorful! 

1-2 tbsp toasted sesame oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup pure maple syrup
2 tsp chili garlic sauce
1/4 cup creamy or crunchy peanut butter
700 2018-01-11 22:39:19 Florida has been soaked with oil from Louisiana drilling. Any off shore drilling can destroy coastlines
701 2018-01-11 22:39:14 needs coconut oil
702 2018-01-11 22:39:05 It takes proof. Are you saying that you and Saviano know who killed her? Why do not you talk about oil trafficking? Why do not you talk about German interests to destroy Malta? Saviano made a mixed salad
703 2018-01-11 22:39:01 @EVHowardLurie @wileyjames made it to north station unscathed. No snake oil needed.
704 2018-01-11 22:38:55 I’m oil pulling and I’m only 4 minutes in and my mouth is exhausted
705 2018-01-11 22:38:55 Just once. I posted a series of oil paintings featuring each Master, including Alex Macqueen from Big Finish. A rando noted that AMQ wasn’t canon and should not be included. We argued briefly about “canon.” Ended with insulting my art and blocking me, giving him the last word.
706 2018-01-11 22:38:53 This is the first time I saw a reasonable tweet,This is the real facts,if you can make a petition against shell oil company for the death of millions death...the whole world we know biafra existed,your problem shall be over.
707 2018-01-11 22:38:46 I had a cousin who was 19 & died in iraq. So 19 is old enough to die for oil (your country) but it's not old enough to consent to sex? What kind of society feels this way? I think we make too big a deal out of sex.
708 2018-01-11 22:38:44 Really happy to see the @SimpleSkincare cleansing oil on this list

710 2018-01-11 22:38:29 No, olive oil, coconut oil, and avocado oil are all great. Olives are technically fruits
711 2018-01-11 22:38:10 Tomatoes, mozz, fresh garlic and olive oil is legit my drug of choice.
712 2018-01-11 22:38:00 Hmmm wonder why they're 'shithole' countries? Is it because America ruined half of them mainly for oil and gas and other extracurricular activities? Boi don't get me started.

718 2018-01-11 22:37:12 To be honest I am not even sure how I feel about Midnight Oil winning a run. But I am sure there are punters older than me (and more in tune with these bands/times) than me that would say they prob were an alternative when started ;) Certainly rock.

722 2018-01-11 22:36:49 A few years back a FB twit posed "Oh, you libtards gonna boycott Chick Fil'A now? You ALSO gonna boycott GASOLINE, since TERRORISTS make money from oil?" 

I gently broke to them the literal thousands of dining alternatives to Chick Fil'A. Also: bicycles, buses and carpooling.
723 2018-01-11 22:36:49 There's so far offshore you can't see him anyway and they have become very very good at what they do what happened in the Gulf was a fluke tons of oil comes up naturally in the ocean dissolves it all day everyday stop being so ignorant. We need the money.

734 2018-01-11 22:35:44 Why do these look like oil paintings?
735 2018-01-11 22:35:44 Try googling "cubic mile of oil". You get a Wikipedia article, a link to that book, a YouTube video from 2015, and then some articles from 2010. Would not exactly call that a "common frame of reference"
736 2018-01-11 22:35:32 whats funny is IF he really wants to show his city is super green...stop using anything that runs on gasoline,and uses oil. then we might believe this isnt anything but grand standing to get political points.
737 2018-01-11 22:35:26 My first art teacher was from France, and in 1962, I asked how to mish flesh colors in oil paint, he replied,"That's easy, we are all various shades of Brown." People are so self-conscious of their own race, they shy from others.

836 2018-01-11 22:24:58 I call bullshit on this meme. It is obvious that 911 was used as a pretext to lie, steal and plunder the Iraqi government for their oil. #FalseFlagOperation #falseWarOnTerrorism
837 2018-01-11 22:24:57 Omg. I get bad ones too! Get lavender essential oil... Doterra makes a good one. It helps a lot!
838 2018-01-11 22:24:40 Read my tweet very well to comprehend the message
839 2018-01-11 22:24:35 Explain to me again how your post-reorg energy equities are driven by your restructuring skills and not just a play on oil/gas prices?

After that, can you compare Puerto Rico to subprime again?
840 2018-01-11 22:24:28 well done is a must. from worst fry to best just by soaking a couple extra minutes in oil
841 2018-01-11 22:24:26 Bio oil !
842 2018-01-11 22:24:23 Mimi, your elitism is showing. $1,000 of “crumbs” fills an oil tank twice; is a car payment with leftover to fill the tank; a lot of groceries, etc.
843 2018-01-11 22:24:23 yup. racism, dirty deals and oil & gas = Trumpism
844 2018-01-11 22:24:17 @chtrader, decime que no te stopeó el oil y todavía estas short...

847 2018-01-11 22:23:41 7 of the 47 areas where oil drilling is/would be allowed are in the Pacific. This is not a threat to CA.

849 2018-01-11 22:23:33 Explain to me how wind turbines can cause an ecological disaster equal to oil drilling offshore and I’m with you.(that’s not true, but humor me)

853 2018-01-11 22:23:01 What Emeka has said is highly out of place and indeed childish. No human deserves to die due to this act. It is most uncharitable for you to say even the small children brought this on themselves. This is why the PMB is disappointing me to a difficult  degree
854 2018-01-11 22:22:59 #Trican is already buying back shares. With oil higher they can increase service charges which will be even better. I wouldn't let it go yet

861 2018-01-11 22:22:28 The wind stopped blowing, Crude Oil closed at $63.80 per barrel today, and a West Texas LEGEND says goodbye...   Guess You can't win them all.  Good Luck Mickey Owens!
862 2018-01-11 22:22:24 Paid mercenaries of the oil company . Companies, are not people , as this clearly showed, once again.
863 2018-01-11 22:22:24 Creativity is the new crude oil.
864 2018-01-11 22:22:05 Sometimes I attempt to ‘pamper’ myself. And by that I mean I have just accidentally smothered so much castor oil on my eyelashes I look like I have conjunctivitis. It’s just constant glamour in this house.
865 2018-01-11 22:21:40 Come to Indonesia to see indonesian essential oil distillation : patchouli, citronella vetiver, etc
866 2018-01-11 22:21:37 Went in Target to get my baby some socks and a toothbrush. I got a roku, body oil, some tea....
867 2018-01-11 22:21:34 However, you talk shit and act like a child; you get treated like one. I have no sympathy for anyone who is 18 and acts like a complete cunt, and acts the victim when it gets challenged. You start the fire, you take the oil and the burns that come with it.
868 2018-01-11 22:21:30 I can’t fucking stand the smell of hot cooking oil .
869 2018-01-11 22:21:16 BTW, bring the oil with you.
870 2018-01-11 22:21:11 oh Sam -- it's not crazy to exclude Florida, therefore Mar-a-Lago, from oil drilling.  It's the act of a stable business genius 
871 2018-01-11 22:21:11 oil changed & air filter replaced  you’re welcome, lil ungrateful car  lolol

873 2018-01-11 22:20:54 That one's best ignored, I think. 

If anyone reading this is confused: ScotGov has zero control of oil revenues, and no way to get control. They go south, like most of our taxes, and we get pocket money back.
874 2018-01-11 22:20:37 "The scent of wine, oh how much more agreeable, laughing, praying, celestial and delicious it is than that of oil!"

875 2018-01-11 22:20:35 Balsamic dressings usually are dairy free, or I use oil and vinegar on my salads. Deli meats are preserved in milk so I usually use leftover chicken breasts or something from a dinner if I'm having a sandwich.
876 2018-01-11 22:20:33 Lots of oil money too, gotta pay for that socialist paradise somehow.
877 2018-01-11 22:20:30 Oil = corruption
878 2018-01-11 22:20:25 I try to trim my hair (1/2 an inch or so) as often as I can, and argan oil helps!!
879 2018-01-11 22:20:14 Snake Oil.  Con.  Not the whole picture.  Bye Social Security.  Bye Medicare.  Bye Medicaid.  I think North Texans value those things....

882 2018-01-11 22:19:38 He didn't sell the US out for $$, or a Trump Tower...Donnie wanted oil from Russia; because T thinks our biggest national security risk is oil for future operations. That's why Rex was brought in as Sec of State-he already knew Putin. 2/2
883 2018-01-11 22:19:30 Apple cider vinegar and coconut oil are heaven sent!

886 2018-01-11 22:19:22 all I'm saying is Alberta is not BC's only source. so threatening an embargo is silly.

oil is in decline anyway. within 10 years investment will dry up and #bigoil including #kindermorgan will be sliding into bankruptcy...
887 2018-01-11 22:19:20 coconut oil packets! like a half ounce each so you stay moisturized but it doesn't get all over your bag.
888 2018-01-11 22:19:19 And Big Bird wants to spends millions in legal fees chasing man made pollution against the oil co’s so he can have a plank for a 2020 run

892 2018-01-11 22:18:53 Both! Oil pastel for the bulbs, chalk for the halos 
893 2018-01-11 22:18:29 In my hometown they have “oil islands” off the coast which are artificial islands designed to hide the drilling rigs with landscaping.
894 2018-01-11 22:18:22 Niggas ain’t respecting me out here baby oil
895 2018-01-11 22:18:07 A lot of the chemical engineers I see on LinkedIn working in oil companies seem to be CU graduates. Where the Abuad graduates at?
896 2018-01-11 22:18:04 Coconut oil in my hair brings my Ashkenazi curls back like a glorious Jewish waterfall.
897 2018-01-11 22:17:31 Racing season is in coming soon, make sure you have your racing oil ordered and your team is ready. Happy Racing for 2018
898 2018-01-11 22:17:30 It explains why Donnie pivoted to exploring oil off the US coasts---because Donnie didn't deliver on reducing sanctions against Russia as he had implied---Putin probably cut off the oil likely promised in their bargain--so Donnie went elsewhere. 1/2
899 2018-01-11 22:17:12 At the Trenton Engine, we installed the fuel pump while it was still, oil pan up. That was my job for awhile in 1969. I also installed oil pumps for awhile, but my longest job was installing the oil pick up tubes, did that job into the 1970 model year. All in the same area.
900 2018-01-11 22:16:58 If the car developed a petrol/oil leak the police would have to deal with it as it would be deemed to be in a dangerous condition..
901 2018-01-11 22:16:54 I love how you are superior at baking but frying is a mystery. It's almost like you can only make food you identify with. Like, we get ambient heat we live in California. Bt we've never been put into a vat of hot oil.
902 2018-01-11 22:16:50 Until their oil runs out!
903 2018-01-11 22:16:37 they tore out your soul and shoved oil paint into the space left behind...  rest in pieces
904 2018-01-11 22:16:32 These are cool! Chalk or oil pastel?

907 2018-01-11 22:16:12 Match. Pike. Oil. Dry. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Oil Nation attacked
908 2018-01-11 22:15:47 Hollywood is as corrupt as the Oil Industry. Both need to be destroyed completely for real positive change to occur.

913 2018-01-11 22:15:24 Hope it's true. Figure it's good for a 5-7% jump in Trump's approval rating if this really gets going.
914 2018-01-11 22:15:24 Had to get an oil change, didnt have time to clean out my car. Sorry to the people who work at toyota

917 2018-01-11 22:15:11 the art community sure is weird. I've asked my teachers what they'd price my oil paintings. Around 5000kr for one. Like????? what???????? that's a lot!! and with digital art it's like... eh, maybe 50 dollars if I'm lucky.
918 2018-01-11 22:15:10 All those many kinds of oil. Still one of the best fries ever though!

920 2018-01-11 22:15:01 A dime-sized amount of olive oil is great to use on wet, curly hair. It will help prevent frizz when your locks dry. #hairtip #beautytip
921 2018-01-11 22:14:52 no prob if Sullivan missed Exxon Valdez he can go to Prince William Sound now and still find oil

924 2018-01-11 22:14:18 Superb-New York is a progressive city & knows what to do.  The fight for Climate change must continue to save our planet.  Bravo Rep. Maloney and Mayor Bill de blasio for caring for the future and suing the oil companies.  Pamela & Walter
925 2018-01-11 22:14:11 @realDonaldTrump ....so now we know that the dog and pony show about bi-partisan Donnie boy was the snake oil salesman doing what comes naturally, lying and self promoting.    POND SCUM.   RUSSIA, UNFIT
926 2018-01-11 22:13:43 Government who have cut renewable payments, forced fracking on councils, given more money to the oil industry are worrying about plastic. Unbelievable
927 2018-01-11 22:13:33 but hurry - to get CHART-MASTER free!! All you need is a time machine, to place your order between Sep 1st and Dec 15, 1989! If you miss(ed) that window: the 1-800 number now offers free road side assistant and 3 oil changes annually!
928 2018-01-11 22:13:31 …  in order to open up what amounts to billions of acres of coastal waters for oil drilling (Florida, home to @realDonaldTrump precious Mar-a-Lago resort, being the only exempted state) in direct violation of & disregard for the bipartisan outrage it has inspired. #ClimateAction
929 2018-01-11 22:13:30 New fields coming on line all the time ! The only problem being is most are deep water and more expensive to retrieve the oil  I have 13 years left and would like to think I will still be involved then 
Westminster needs to lie and will as they are self opinionated

932 2018-01-11 22:13:24 Oh definitely! I just think coconut oil and honey would be good all year round! A preventative!!

943 2018-01-11 22:12:44 There 4 years ago,and it's no expert,the same "Newspaper" that told us we weren't getting a oil crash and to invest in it.
Your proving your living in a fantasy world where the facts of then don't match now.

949 2018-01-11 22:12:13 Also, why would citizens of an oil rich country where healthcare is a right, not a privilege, want to move to the USA? I guess it depends on your definition of shithole.
950 2018-01-11 22:12:03 Fair question! Presumably I'd end up overweight in oil, commodities and FANGS. Mainly though it wouldn't be much fun! Do agree that Buffett probably has it right on trackers.

960 2018-01-11 22:11:03 So will the Tories stop taking money from oil CEOs and stop fracking instead increasing subsidy rather than cutting it to green energy?

979 2018-01-11 22:09:10 Not quite sure how this is relevant but, if you're going for the "media are picking on us angle", then I suppose you wouldn't know much about that having only been relevant since the oil money started rolling in. Paul Dickov and Nicky Weaver never really generated headlines.
980 2018-01-11 22:08:56 Cannabis oil may or may not cure cancer, but the best medical treatment available will only delay my demise. Cannabis oil will not harm me in any way, and may be beneficial and may, possibly, cure it. It is, therefore, reasonable to continue using it. 2

982 2018-01-11 22:08:18 Westminster and the media keep telling us oil is now worthless and it's running out. 
Do you believe THEM?

991 2018-01-11 22:07:36 not really.

just don't want the pipeline or oil sands expanded...
992 2018-01-11 22:07:30 Stolen!  Surely  they came to us cap in hand 300 years ago and signed away their rights for the royal shilling.  Oil was first extracted in the 1850s so we were subsidising their profligacy for 150 years before oil was discovered.

Thank you both for this joy.
995 2018-01-11 22:07:21 @AM730Traffic OIL SLICK on Lougheed Hwy westbound in the merge zone just after the Cape Horn loop construction area. Go slow through there!
996 2018-01-11 22:07:21 That’s exactly why Florida gets a pass. Oil rigs within the line of sight for Mar-a-Lago would devalue property values, but everywhere else is perfectly fine as long as Trumps golf club isn’t affected.

998 2018-01-11 22:07:00 All you do is boil green tomatoes, onions, jalapeños, Serrano Chile’s . Then drain it afterwards and blend it until it’s thick and with no chucks Then fry it a little in oil and seasonings. Then it’s lit lmao.
999 2018-01-11 22:06:57 I'm not on my own then? Talking of Aqua. I've used black Aqua undercoat and applied black oil gloss and found over time (maybe a year) the gloss turned flat like eggshell. Don't know what was happening there!
1000 2018-01-11 22:06:52 Ah, they are extreme examples. America in the 1950s before Globalists exported the factories. Germany is essentially self-sufficient. It only ruins other countries with Deutsch-Globalism but keeps everything in-house. We don’t even benefit from our oil or gas (and there’s loads!)
1001 2018-01-11 22:06:51 I know right!! Really the richy white oil folks here spent 47 years with the same conservative govt. & then Calgary had the audacity to elect Nenshi AGAIN! They are freaking out they may not control everything. Like toddlers they lash out.  I hope Edmonton Would do better??
1002 2018-01-11 22:06:43  fuckkk. Well I did a oil change and so far no check engine light or oil light so I’m pray that maybe changing the oil fixed my issue
1003 2018-01-11 22:06:33 I despise Trump, didn’t vote for him. Never wanted him. It’s a real tell tail sign when one can’t even win their own state, or even obtain a loan from Banks in their home state. The wiser of us all knew he was nothing more than a con artist, a snake  oil salesman.

1011 2018-01-11 22:05:43 Makes one wonder if Big Solar and Big Wind will actuall be any better than Big Coal or Big Oil.
1012 2018-01-11 22:05:27 This is insulting, Senator. You’ve voted to allow:
-expanded offshore oil drilling 
-drilling in ANWR
-zero compensation $ by oil companies for oil spill cleanup

It is obvious that you don’t give a damn about our fisheries and waters.

1014 2018-01-11 22:05:09 I got my oil changed today and it went so smoothly
1015 2018-01-11 22:05:04 There is a trade in there somewhere, the front end can’t significantly outperform the back end forever, especially as the tighter supply situation is partly engineered. Any sustainability in the oil rally should eventually drag up the deferred months.

1018 2018-01-11 22:04:44 Thanks George. I am aware that much of the evidence circulating about Cannabis oil curing cancer is 'anecdotal'. There is another important factor involved. The perfectly reasonable desire to do something pro-active in the face of something that is going to kill me anyway. 1

Been offered the flu jab and jabs for my disease (ankylosing spondylitis), refused it even though my pain is unreal at times. CBD oil works best for me.
1116 2018-01-11 21:51:52 The US Dollar is a utility token required to purchase Saudi oil. This creates demand that props it up artificially. It has no cap. Mining occurs unchecked in vast quantities. Management team provides zero transparency or audits. If this were crypto, it would be a poor coin.
1117 2018-01-11 21:51:51 I agree. Like Saddam Hussein whom he increasingly resembles (complete with two sons!), he's going to burn the oil fields behind him if he's forced out.
1118 2018-01-11 21:51:45 ESPN and hockey = oil and water
1119 2018-01-11 21:51:41 Just don't forget about oil changes 
1120 2018-01-11 21:51:38 Shame they ain't a bank or an oil company or the government would have bailed them out
1121 2018-01-11 21:51:36 Laundry done, e’s room is clean, my room is cleaned and reorganized (moved some stuff around), ran to stores, got my oil change, and dinner is done. This momma is winning today. 
1122 2018-01-11 21:51:31 Conscious decisions, you mean stumbling upon great oil wealth?
1123 2018-01-11 21:51:26 My scalp only likes the brown macadamia oil ones just for the record, but I did take those ones to Italy and they were okay on my scalp. Hope you love them as much as I do! Xx
1124 2018-01-11 21:51:18 I had to get the oil changed on my car today, what is the "shit hole" comment?
1125 2018-01-11 21:51:16 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
1126 2018-01-11 21:51:10 @nytimes NYC declaring war on the oil industry is a VERY BIG DEAL.  Shame on you for not putting it on the front page.
1127 2018-01-11 21:51:08 Automobile, Tire and Oil companies - end of story.
1128 2018-01-11 21:51:03 Lool edge controls don’t last on 4c hairs but you can try the ORS olive oil edge control & moco de gorila gel together . Edges would lay for like 2 days!! Or just go with the eco styler gel. And don’t forget to tie your scarf round it sis!
1129 2018-01-11 21:50:48 Being hard core judged for doing homework where I get my car’s oil change.
1130 2018-01-11 21:50:47 I like trivia - #TodayInHistory 1. Oil strike in #Beaumont #Texas starts the US oil & gas industry. 2. US #SurgeonGeneral releases the 1st report saying #smoking is harmful and we still smoke (yes, I did too, for a short while).
1131 2018-01-11 21:50:41 GTFO lmao. Alternator went bad from the oil leak I had last year. It was full of oil, in surprised it lasted this long lol
1132 2018-01-11 21:50:36 Nigga I drop games on the regular. Coco butter and baby oil makes my hand to smooth. Shit be falling through
1133 2018-01-11 21:50:23 & gone short on oil crude @ 6,950
All based mainly on your posts & @GlobalProTrader 's notes along with a bit of chart reading & common sense but thank you both!
1134 2018-01-11 21:50:13 I don’t like that analogy.  Either you paint a house or you don’t.  I don’t have 31 other painters trying to sabotage my paint job. It’s hockey. + I think mcllellan is a huge reason the team exceeded last years expectations and got the oilers in the playoffs in just 97s 2nd yr
1135 2018-01-11 21:50:11 Wait until they find out that there’s very little actual chocolate in Junior Mints...pretty much a mixture of sugar and peppermint oil. 

Who is it that has time to file this kind of lawsuit anyway? I must be doing something wrong with my life.

1138 2018-01-11 21:50:02 my colleague works on oil/gas reservoir modeling, so it'll be used for running those codes
1139 2018-01-11 21:49:55 Lots of Sams Clubs are closing. What shall we do without 5 gallon laundry detergent, a gallon jug of fake olive oil and 178 rolls of toilet paper? The shame of it all. #SamsClub
1140 2018-01-11 21:49:54 I really hate getting my oil changed. It takes to long.
1141 2018-01-11 21:49:50 It was originally recommended to me to put the oil directly under my tongue and hold there for a minute. I only made that horrible mistake once. Now, I drop it into a shot of water, and toss it back like tequila!
1142 2018-01-11 21:49:42 HRC tried to tell them but they wouldn’t listen. The con came in with snake oil and everybody thought He’s a billionaire (liar) and he knows how to make $. He has a history of bankruptcies!!
1143 2018-01-11 21:49:38 Oil is taxed by metered barrels produced - the government doesnt get $70 per barrel that is the oil companies - the tax revenues are negotiated with the individual companies - Hence Norway making 18Bn in the same year UK only allegedly made 50million
1144 2018-01-11 21:49:25 Can states cut it out with the NIMBY approach?  We should be phasing out oil drilling EVERYWHERE! Climate change and spills are harmful wherever they occur. @EnvAm
1145 2018-01-11 21:49:22 oil chart soon to be gold chart.
1146 2018-01-11 21:49:14 I hope he said it
1147 2018-01-11 21:49:09 I suppose so. I do hope you didn't give in to Snickers, Starburst and Oil of Olay so easily.
1148 2018-01-11 21:49:07 Part 2  Every major consumer was a buyer in the last US export sales report. This illustrates that the stocks estimated by the USDA on 8/1 were either phantom or min. pipeline stock levels. Polyester is also rallying , oil has doubled in price, pollution controls

1151 2018-01-11 21:48:56 @stevenmnuchin1 #TaxReform. Creating a new W4 so refunds stay in place! Yu are preying on folks' ignorance like  a TRUE snake oil salesman!!
1152 2018-01-11 21:48:20 Don't you dare tell me what to do. You do not pay my bills. BTW and just to rub it in: I bought Tesla shares when they were $39 and sold them when they were $239. I don't need to work anymore, paid all my debts and have the whole day to tell you oil corporate slaves what to do.
1153 2018-01-11 21:48:15 This is not all.Most appointments in other sectors including the oil and gas are now reserved for certain people,whilst even those from the oil producing states are not allowed employment or appointments in this sector. All contracts in the oil sector is also given to them
1154 2018-01-11 21:48:06 
1155 2018-01-11 21:47:58 Is baby oil made of babies, Ben?
1156 2018-01-11 21:47:55 Our past 20+ year policy toward NOKO has been 'supervised neglect'. Time to cut off oil and goods to NOKO.
1157 2018-01-11 21:47:52 They way you cook things can change how something tastes. For instance, boiled Brussels Sprouts vs pan roasting/saute with olive oil, salt, garlic, onion - be sure to quarter them - caramelizing them is good. For me, beets were rejected by my tastebuds as kid, even beet greens.
1158 2018-01-11 21:47:51 And by the way, I am not in favor of any of it, just pointing it out.  Leftists seem a bit defensive these days...  I find cronyism despicable and both sides play it.  Dems do green and hedge funds and Repubs do defense and oil...

1160 2018-01-11 21:47:51 From Miami Beach; grew up on beaches w/ ocean horizon of ships & recreat’l boats. Landscape of oil rigs & derricks? Not so scenic. All states should retain right to decide. Fed’l govt. can offer incentives to encourage oil independence
1161 2018-01-11 21:47:41 Wish I knew where my CBD oil went.
1162 2018-01-11 21:47:31 Rosehip oil is sooo good 
1163 2018-01-11 21:47:29 Oil prices
1164 2018-01-11 21:47:02 Baffles me too. Heard Brexiters say 'we'll just have to eat British grown vegs'. They may buy sprouts and parsnips at Xmas but don't eat them. They live off subtle rearrangements of wheat, soy, sunflower oil and sugar. You seen many wheat fields in the UK? #FBPE
1165 2018-01-11 21:46:59 Yea I’m at dealership getting my oil change and the newer version of my whip for 10 to 20 dollars more a month is intriguing 
1166 2018-01-11 21:46:50 If I was vegan I wouldn’t like it, but I guess it would depend on what kind of oil was used.
1167 2018-01-11 21:46:40 anyone take safflower oil pills?
1168 2018-01-11 21:46:32 There's a lady at the hotel that has fresh flowers and an oil defusser in her room and that is the level of extra I aspire to be
1169 2018-01-11 21:46:31 Trump: We will provide a ladder of opportunity...a rope ladder...dangling 20 feet off the ground...soaked in baby oil...that leads to the other side of the Mexican wall.
1170 2018-01-11 21:46:31 Brent crude has risen to a three-year high of $70 a barrel on fears that President Donald Trump will hit Iran with fresh sanctions as soon as this week, constraining oil supply just as global demand gathers strength.
1171 2018-01-11 21:46:23 They're trying to boost oil prices
1172 2018-01-11 21:46:13 And I apply coconut oil cause my face feels tight and sore and peals but nothing seems to help bring it back to normal
1173 2018-01-11 21:46:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, or these voices to be heard.
1174 2018-01-11 21:45:56 Is the baby oil wrestling the same time as the food b/c Im just hungry
1175 2018-01-11 21:45:34 Lavender oil us good for relaxing the body and mind. Put a few drops on your pillow = zzzz
1176 2018-01-11 21:45:12 You too, Billy. I can relate to dental pain/issues. Another 1 of my way too many issues to list. Sadly, I don't have dental insurance. I'm "Vet Poor". Had to choose between heating oil for house or flea treatment. I chose heating oil.
1177 2018-01-11 21:45:06 I’ve been using rosehip oil lately to moisturize my lips and it tastes awful lol but I’m sure a quick google search would find a ton of easy options
1178 2018-01-11 21:45:03 Are you forgetting soggy pumpkin soaked in oil too?
1179 2018-01-11 21:44:13 Also recall that Amazon is only a platform. Most of what they sell isn't sold by Amazon, but instead a 3rd party via Amazon's infrastructure. This isn't as simple as Standard Oil or Rockefeller Steel, too much has changed in 100 years.
1180 2018-01-11 21:44:09 Correct! These guys are are straight-up gangsters, thieves, and wish-a-be thugs. They have feathered their nest with mass judicial appointments to cover their getaway. Their oil, and banking buddies are payed-off. They've been in the vault just long enough, time to run.#300Days
1181 2018-01-11 21:43:58 Wanna take a getaway wit someone special. I’m talkin spa style jacuzzi tub fluffy robe oil rub down feed eachother strawberries and have astronomical sex typa getaway
1182 2018-01-11 21:43:56 Ha! Perfect! But doubt he actually uses the snake oil bs he pushes, being an alien god and all.
1183 2018-01-11 21:43:56 They are doing an oil change to no charge lol
1184 2018-01-11 21:43:48 Jergens or coconut oil
1185 2018-01-11 21:43:30 I think the fear for Oil is that Max will bolt UFA after next year. Otherwise yes, it would make sense.
1186 2018-01-11 21:43:28 Yes, though we might also wish for some revolutionary new energy source that makes oil too cheap to be able to fund both luxuries and fuckwittery.
1187 2018-01-11 21:43:22 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
1188 2018-01-11 21:43:15 As a progressive socialist Bill you're not very Progressive. Think of the high wage paying jobs that you're not bringing into the state of Florida by working against drilling. Oil wells have extremely good safety records as you're aware.

1191 2018-01-11 21:42:47 Do people really buy tuna in oil?
1192 2018-01-11 21:42:41 Aussie energy shares could lift higher today off the back of Wall Street advances after oil reached a three-year high #DailyMarketUpdate #ausbiz

This is a great event to meet some of the Oil Kings, get some autographs and go for a skate with your family and some special guests! All are welcome as this is an open event with no charge!
1194 2018-01-11 21:42:22 They are absurdly agitating for a grazing reserve because they saw how possible it was to claim ownership of oil wells in Niger delta. And what have they gifted Niger delta? Oil spills and oil cleanup! For grazing reserve they will gift you Islamisation, rape and genocide. #Exit
1195 2018-01-11 21:42:19 Good afternoon here at A to Z we want everyone to know that we have great offers and deals that will blow your mind! For ex. 3 years free oil change and 3 years free labor on all vehicles! were open Monday-Friday 9am-7pm and Saturdays 9am-5pm! contact us at 561-429-3450

1197 2018-01-11 21:41:53 black castor oil, rosemary oil, olive oil, basically just drown it in oils and pray lmao
1198 2018-01-11 21:41:22 Hate coming to get oil changes alone  idk wtf they be talking about tryna make me replace EVERYTHING. Leave spending $100 when all i wanted was new oil
1199 2018-01-11 21:41:11 IMO- The deal T made w/Kremlim was two-fold: T wanted dirt on his opponent plus that US buy Rus. oil in the future, IF T WINS--> in exchange for T's admin reducing costly sanctions, not aiding Ukraine, & hands off w/Syria problem. Once links exposed-T pivoted 4 oil off US coasts.
1200 2018-01-11 21:40:49 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
1201 2018-01-11 21:40:46 Psa 23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies; thou anointest my head with oil, my cup overflows.

1203 2018-01-11 21:40:34 Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, ‘A kilogram of wheat for a day’s wages,[a] and three kilograms of barley for a day’s wages,[b] and do not damage the oil and the wine!’
1204 2018-01-11 21:40:33 Nothing like seeing the twinkling lights of oil rigs dotting the horizon of an otherwise beautiful surf-side twilight.
1205 2018-01-11 21:40:30 Coconut oil chapstick is a saving grace! I was the same and now I will never use a chapstick that isn’t coconut oil based!

1209 2018-01-11 21:40:17 The Jersey Shore is serene and beautiful. The Shore is a vital part of New Jersey and essential for tourism dollars. Oil drilling will lead to spills which will devastate the Jersey Shore! No offshore drilling, not now, not ever! Come on @GovChristie!

1213 2018-01-11 21:40:03 #PaulaWhite is a snake oil saleswoman. She is cut from the same fake cloth as Benny Hinn & the rest of TBN. God never asked for money. What’s he gonna do with cash?! He also called on folks to privately tithe and not do it to be showy or proclaim our own holiness. She’s a scammer
1214 2018-01-11 21:40:02 It's just a brain in some oil that's the pill, diy coming soon stay tuned
1215 2018-01-11 21:39:50 Went to get my oil changed and he tells me I need new breaks 
1216 2018-01-11 21:39:48 Are you trying to indicate this may be a snake oil pedaller?? 
1217 2018-01-11 21:39:23 Oh voor haar. Ja klopt. Ik heb nu een nog betere tip: castor oil.
1218 2018-01-11 21:39:09 Okay  just keep moisturising, it’s supposed to reduce the oil
1219 2018-01-11 21:39:06 @Tully @EllisMate @JasonEllisShow Don't judge all of us Albertans based on oilfield tools like that caller. He doesn't understand the PM doesn't control the price of oil. Not all of us are haters. #LovingTheSinging
1220 2018-01-11 21:38:56 Took a bath with coconut oil in my hair long story sort my hair got wet in the water and now my whole body feels like the inside of a lubed up condom.

Forced to watch nba
1222 2018-01-11 21:38:34 Valve oil? Never heard of her. I only use the finest of brass lotion
1223 2018-01-11 21:38:31 Why are we about to drill for oil off our coasts just so we can sell it to other countries? This make absolutely no sense. Oh, wait. These are Republicans trying to do this. That explains everything.

Today it's reported on BusinessNewsNetwork that US about to IMPORT NatGas from Russia.

#Iran claims it's not after nuke bomb! New tough sanctions on the regime (oil & everything else) for its human rights violations would work best by cutting funds  to #IRGC that helps people overthrow the regime!

1227 2018-01-11 21:37:46 Yea kinyi hijra ne
1228 2018-01-11 21:37:43 Then we should all sue NYC. With their large population, as well as extensive fleet of city vehicles using oil and fuel, they've helped contribute to global warming. So nyah!!
1229 2018-01-11 21:37:38 I'm  sorry for her loosing her job but unfortunately blue collar jobs are becoming a thing of the past.  Bottom line however is that too many bought the snake oil from the con man believing it would make their world better.  He lied. They listened. These arête consequences.
1230 2018-01-11 21:37:28 @htrinkunas would international sanctions & foreign support for the opposition in order to “liberalise” #Venezuela’s #oil, sorry people, play any part in the “hyperinflation” the country is suffering under? >>>
1231 2018-01-11 21:37:25 Damn ma. Let me give you an oil change.
1232 2018-01-11 21:37:23 Forget you! We need the oil!
1233 2018-01-11 21:37:22 Bicycle commuter tax benefit killed in tax bill. This will pay 5 million of the tax breaks for super rich. But tax benefit for cars stayed Good thing there is no climate change and it is ok to destroy shores and parks drilling for oil. #taxcuts #climatechange #bikenyc Charlie

1237 2018-01-11 21:37:05 If painting houses was your career, and I hired (and paid) you to paint my house, and you didn't paint the house, it would be a failure. Now, if multiple people hired (and paid) you to paint houses, and you didn't paint any houses, you would have a terrible house-painting career.
1238 2018-01-11 21:36:58 lol it was a large skinless breast, my oil wasn't deep enough so it ended up looking like a pancake on the flat sides.
1239 2018-01-11 21:36:52 Do you understand the dangers of global warming?Who has done the most physically to address this?  Al Gore has raised the alarm. What are you doing to reduce it?  Where do you get your information ?  Big oil and Russia,a big oil producer have sown a lot of anti Musk propaganda
1240 2018-01-11 21:36:38 What is your plan for us to become energy independent? Americans are tired of sending money to the Middle East to fund terrorism through oil. Renewable energy will not be ready to replace fossil fuels for at least 50 years.
1241 2018-01-11 21:36:34 But by all means they will need oil
1242 2018-01-11 21:36:31 Candles, oil burners, petals on the water and a glass of Chardonnay?
1243 2018-01-11 21:36:27 In the Navy the southern way I say oil got more crap than any other word.
1244 2018-01-11 21:36:24 HOW COME WHEN A REPUBLICAN IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE THE PRICE OF OIL GOES THROUGH THE ROOF, YET WHEN A DEMOCRAT IS IN IT FALLS SHARPLY? NO SHORTAGE OF PROPANE EITHER. MARKET MANIPULATION! FUEL OIL HAS RISEN OVER 60 CENTS A GALLON IN THE LAST 2 WEEKS.
1245 2018-01-11 21:35:36 Mnuchin ran interference by presenting the good news but not the bad regarding store closing.  How can anyone trust these snake oil salesmen in the white house.
1246 2018-01-11 21:35:32 The Sharks hired McLellan to win the Stanley Cup. He failed. I'm assuming the Oilers hired McLellan to make the playoffs in the final year of McDavid's ELC. He failed.
1247 2018-01-11 21:35:30 People should be educated to modern drilling methods. Lee zeldin should stop acting like a Democrat. The future is oil not giving our money to the Arabs

1300 2018-01-11 21:30:12 100% agree with Joanna! You can also use Tea Tree essential oil, the only difference with the Body Shop's product is that it's just the oil and probably costs less.

1325 2018-01-11 21:27:01 I’ve used with success. Oil purity should be 1st consideration, production standards through 3rd party testing. All oils I use are diluted w/ fractionated coconut oils or massage lotion. I check for allergies. Plenty of reputable companies sell oils. Do your research.

1330 2018-01-11 21:26:43 Blog - Why did the U.K.generate less revenue for the state thanNorway fromNorthSea O&G?
1) the timing of U.K and Norway's production relative to global Oil&Gas prices, 
2) lower average U.K. tax receipts from petroleum production 
3)Norwegian state's direct investment in industry

Following the recent  Oil Price reports, Venuezela happens to be the cheapest country of petrol with a price of $0.01 (N3.6). That's pump price.  Refinery bulk price would be less...1/3

1389 2018-01-11 21:18:52 Snake Oil AF 
1390 2018-01-11 21:18:43 Canola oil. You definitely do her.
1391 2018-01-11 21:18:38 Let's all hope there aren't any oil reserves discovered there any time this term.
1392 2018-01-11 21:18:36 glib glob gloob i need a tube of  white oil paint, but not some strong chemicals or else i might faint, but not an acrylic because that's what it ain't.
1393 2018-01-11 21:18:33 Every nigga in the hood sell fragrance oil
1394 2018-01-11 21:18:31 :(( at least put lots of coconut oil in ur hair before and let it sit for an hour so it doesnt hella damage it
1395 2018-01-11 21:18:20 Incase the oil falls off
1396 2018-01-11 21:18:09 Bet that made a giant cloud of citrus oil biting into it like that.
1397 2018-01-11 21:18:09 Was in Russia June/July/October 2016 Lobbing & Speaking How tRUmp, IF ELECTED would LIFT U.S. Sanctions so EXXON could Fulfill Contract w/Putin-Russia-GAZPROM to Be able to drill for oil in RUSSIA. A contract Rex Tillerson, Then-CEO EXXON, NOW-SecOfState under trump
1398 2018-01-11 21:17:59 Not only that. Hundreds of whales are dying or have died due to the drilling in the arctic already. Horrible! Beyond my ability to describe my anguish at how those sonic oil finder killed whales! No need for more oil. It’s MONEY. It’s evil.
1399 2018-01-11 21:17:58 @realDonaldTrump #OilPrice You mentioned before you ran for President that oil should be around $20.00 per barrel. It’s over $60.00. We have oil every where. Put the brakes on this rise in oil prices.
1400 2018-01-11 21:17:54 We can initiate durable story-telling or harmonize policy makers that diversify transnational oil reserves. #OceanOptimism
1401 2018-01-11 21:17:54 THE KELLY CLARKSON COVER OF ITS QUIET UPTOWN IS PLAYING WHILE I GET MY OIL CHANGED
1402 2018-01-11 21:17:50 And if 70 is new normal for oil? Offshore drilling rig market will not rebalance? Or too much oversupply there?
1403 2018-01-11 21:17:32 I use the oil in the morning, before i put on my moisturizer (which is also bobbi brown). My skin has been hella dry from the weather though so I've been using a night oil recently from origins (a brand i've never tried before)
1404 2018-01-11 21:17:29 Ima try this lavender oil and take a hot ass bath
1405 2018-01-11 21:17:17 fat folks having sex in a kiddy pool full of baby oil would be pretty loud too imagine

1407 2018-01-11 21:17:11 How do you feel about cross contamination (vegan food being cooked on the same fryer or same oil as meats)
1408 2018-01-11 21:17:10 I've had a similar notion when I was waiting for an oil change and saw an television advertisement for teeth-whitening, "Get the bright teeth and while smile that you deserve!" and I thought, *Who the fuck actually deserves that? How does one earn such a thing?*
1409 2018-01-11 21:17:05 I hope it helps you quit smoking. You won't get high from CBD oil. However, it's the physical motions of smoking that are also addictive. I quit smoking with Chantix over two years ago. Still mimic smoking in my sleep. Says my roomie.
1410 2018-01-11 21:17:01 @TeamCavuto if oil prices go up, and wipe out tax raises, trump is toast !!!
1411 2018-01-11 21:16:57 i found one apartment listing i can afford in chicago and of course the pictures of the house are just oil paintings the tenant made...of the house...

1416 2018-01-11 21:16:26 Is this the oil for January? I've been wanting to try it! How much of a vanilla-like smell does it have?
1417 2018-01-11 21:16:23 They speak a different language when you go to get your oil changed
1418 2018-01-11 21:16:16 Your sisters know what ah gwan. Off-brand coconut oil is disrespectful to oneself.
1419 2018-01-11 21:16:05 Adulthood in your early 20’s is fuckin weird, man. Your life just becomes paying bills and getting excited about stupid shit like oil diffusers & accent rugs while still finding time to black out
1420 2018-01-11 21:15:56 yeah i dont think this move in oil does much for dayrates, offshore rigs more a supply and demand issue vs oil price.  cold/warm stacked rigs mean that will take awhile to work out.

1424 2018-01-11 21:15:32 Why does Trump insist upon trying to go back to the stone age by approving offshore drilling, haven't oil companies done enough damage?
1425 2018-01-11 21:15:32 you can’t expect coconut oil to solve all your problems
1426 2018-01-11 21:15:25 Inordinately proud of the pasta I threw together, but if you're as kinda bourgeois as me and have these to hand, do it:

A grated courgette, loads of minced garlic, some rosemary + chilli gently fried in olive oil, mixed in with pasta + lotsa cheese, toasted hazelnuts on top.
1427 2018-01-11 21:15:13 Thinking about tactical oil shorting via puts buying. What you think - which month better to use? Some spring?
1428 2018-01-11 21:15:07 She'll get a job lobbying for the oil industry.
1429 2018-01-11 21:15:05 Tem como isso? Comprei um oil que é pra ser sem sabor, na caixinha diz light, mas ba, tinha que ser um 99% nicotina senão não adianta

1432 2018-01-11 21:14:46 i don’t believe a word of this Sanchez stuff, looks like a story cooked up by Citys PR people to try and make them look good, did the same with Otamendi, create fake interest to try and claim some bragging rights. No amount of oil money will ever shake their inferiority complex
1433 2018-01-11 21:14:42 I only keep a small $APA long still don't understand why it's not trading in the 60s greatest oil asset in the $XLE
1434 2018-01-11 21:14:42 Now time to sit for almost 3 hours to get my oil changed 
1435 2018-01-11 21:14:41 Went to get an oil change..I don’t need an oil change
1436 2018-01-11 21:14:28 I only spent $1.08 on an oil change and got a free cookie
1437 2018-01-11 21:14:18 Going to start marketing very expensive DNA-cleansing snake oil to them 
1438 2018-01-11 21:14:12 Is your oil money not enough for you ffs
1439 2018-01-11 21:14:11 Ya apparently they cook it in the same oil as the meats? Which I’ve never really cared too much about before, but I feel like I should that sounds gross?
1440 2018-01-11 21:14:06 I’ve been using Elemis moisturiser, cleansing balm and toner! It’s loooovely, keeps your skin hydrated and balances the oil 
1441 2018-01-11 21:14:02 Should we put Keto Coffee on our menu?

1442 2018-01-11 21:13:57 an "Oil Painting" 
1443 2018-01-11 21:13:34 Is this your idea of a lay-away plan to pay for the inevitable oil spills when you allow the drilling in our coastal waters? Except near Mar-A-Lago of course.
1444 2018-01-11 21:13:32 You may have a $90,000 sports car but you just got passed by a '99 Nissan Altima that needs new spark plugs and an oil change
1445 2018-01-11 21:13:26 He didn't run because a wealthier candidate, who is also a farmer from the populated east, is running against Heidi. State Sen Tom Campbell is already running ads. In ND you have to balance the farmers with the oil guys. I think the farmers will stay with Heidi. It will be close.

1450 2018-01-11 21:12:53 Apply any HA water based products before oils, because it can't penetrate through oil, but I normally would do HA, moisturizer, then oil & its great.
1451 2018-01-11 21:12:47 4)Europeans that we weren't paying around $6.00/gal? It was the same one who tried to block opening oil reserves,  new exploration, another pipeline, & fracking.  In fact, it is only because of the libs failed attempts to stop fracking that gas isn't still above $4. On that note,

@OGCarterMillz
1453 2018-01-11 21:12:38 Sure. Business cycle already quite extended + oil starting to show dark power again :)  ( almost every recession was accompanied with oil spike) - if some geodisruption lately this year and Brent > 80... Uh oh

But  now we have very strong global economy upswing
1454 2018-01-11 21:12:33 It was tongue-in-cheek, however he does hate California since he really wants to screw Californians with oil drilling and fucked up tax schemes. He would try to keep Hollywood tho.
1455 2018-01-11 21:12:29 Get ready for a fast crash in $USO $UWT $XLE $ERX $GUSH
$USD $DXY will bounce and oil related are so overbought with weak fundamental
1456 2018-01-11 21:12:24 Makes total sense. Lets flood the market with oil to get it incredibly cheap to fight against the cost of solar and natural gas...

1462 2018-01-11 21:11:40 Maybe just me but $DO at $20 is pretty dumb fundamentally, oil and energy sentiment notwithstanding.
1463 2018-01-11 21:11:37 @CNNPolitics Why are you not talking about the burning oil ship dumping oil right now?  This is directly related to trump forcing coastal Democrat states to allow oil drilling? @DeadlineWH @TheBeatWithAri @RepAdamSchiff @maddow
1464 2018-01-11 21:11:33 But I realized recently that subbing Olive oil for butter would make a lot of my dishes vegan. Blue runners are vegan, ya know. Lol

You just called me stupid a minute ago- just for being born straight white and male. You want me to identify as female or a jar of jam or North Sea oil rig instead?
1471 2018-01-11 21:10:58 yes norway do fish krill Japan china and norway are the worst offenders .  The wolves are native, there is no wall between countries and the wolves do not know the difference. To leave 12 is simply unjustifiable. As for oil. To open op even more areas of the arctic ????
1472 2018-01-11 21:10:52 Every time I get my oil changed at @Sears I regret my decision cause it takes SO GD LONG.
1473 2018-01-11 21:10:49 Scotland has around 8% of the UK population and over 30% of the UK land mass. Apart from oil we have renewables, a big agri/food sector, a vibrant tech sector, a good education system, a robust global brand, big tourist business and room to grow. What is it you think we lack?
1474 2018-01-11 21:10:31 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
1475 2018-01-11 21:10:30 Or OR resolve the Departments of Education, Energy, stop all foreign $$ to countries that despise America and the EPA. open drilling and increase the National Oil Reserve from current levels to 10x until we get energy independence from Middle East Nations

1480 2018-01-11 21:10:10 according to Tom McClellan, the SPX follows the oil futures chart with a 10year lag and has for decades. So look at oil 10years ago for clues to what's next
1481 2018-01-11 21:09:55 Russia needs war to increase oil price
1482 2018-01-11 21:09:51 Oklahoma is terminally inflicted by the stranglehold of oil & gas interests.
They are teetering at the point of no return and I don't hold much hope for the near future.

1484 2018-01-11 21:09:46 You must be very healthy! I just had tofu browned in a little sesame oil, with kale, red cabbage, carrots, soy sauce, ginger and garlic. It was delicious and healthy—and no animals suffered.
1485 2018-01-11 21:09:45 I love peppermint and lavender! They're kind of expensive to get the legit oils that are 100% oil so I haven't bought that many yet
1486 2018-01-11 21:09:44 my sisters came to my apartment and saw some off brand coconut oil..you woulda thought they found a crackpipe with how disgusted they were
1487 2018-01-11 21:09:35 Prices of oil rise to $70 per barrel

1492 2018-01-11 21:09:30 Wonderful presentations Naomi. That last press question at 1h 20m... will NYC choose to moderate its demands so that the oil companies remain solvent enough to pay? It's a perspective on the magnitude of climate damage which all our politicians the world over must heed.

1500 2018-01-11 21:08:37 Batteries, booming renewables, DR, EE plus determined elected officials and communities in about 20 states tired of being attacked and disrespected by oil and gas do pose a growing problem for oil  and gas. Problem just starting.

1516 2018-01-11 21:06:10 Prices have come down since then. There is a reason has an oil companies use renewables and it isn’t for the environment. Unsubsidized renewable projects are undercutting thermal plants, leading to steam turbine layoff at GE

1529 2018-01-11 21:04:17 I'm glad FL is off but how about not drilling off other states either? It's obvious the locals do NOT want drilling for oil on their beautiful shores so you should respect their wishes.
1530 2018-01-11 21:04:11 The oil corporations advocate a very low fee. I advocate a high one. Big difference. 

Respectfully, you're just plain wrong that making fossil fuel expensive wouldn't be a pressure for shifting away. Pigouvian taxes do work - even in the real world.
1531 2018-01-11 21:04:05 Gas/Oil prices going up, lots of people suffer under the increases.
Thanks a bunch, @realDonaldTrump #SarcasmFontNeeded
1532 2018-01-11 21:03:59 We can’t park in front of our own house (granted we are renting and my grandma owns the house) and someone complained there were oil stains ON OUR OWN PARKING PAD so we have to park in our garage, always, without exception 
1533 2018-01-11 21:03:58 doesn't matter what bullsh*t they're peddling-trump can't afford to see his property values go down when the oil rigs go up. so many texas sh*tburd touristy trap towns crawling with industrial parks- thick smoke choking the nature & wildlife "preserves" sponsored by DOW CHEMICAL.
1534 2018-01-11 21:03:53 So, this is why there are "households that can get out a pan, add the oil and cauliflower, flip, serve and eat but couldn't cut a cauliflower to start." 
Because we have to choose. Products such as pre-cut veggies are a tremendous aid.
1535 2018-01-11 21:03:51 I honestly think no pipeline through Quebec should have the consequence of no equalization payment. Quebec and Maritimes and U.S. importing Saudi oil is treason if you ask me.
1536 2018-01-11 21:03:46 Keep telling yourself that.. keep hustle na una oil work be that
1537 2018-01-11 21:03:42 More like apathetic toward our Rule of Law. It is rather obvious, sadly, to so many. "Illegal" can never mean "legal!" No more than water and oil. Love of God, Country, & Corps. Semper Fidelis
1538 2018-01-11 21:03:34 And lastly you can’t have better health drilling more holes in the ground and the air or water being polluted with oil leaks or poisonous gases just because you want to make money from it that’s not helping the health of anybody
1539 2018-01-11 21:03:18 A week after a brutal snowstorm froze New York City, Mayor De Blasio delivered a one-two punch Wednesday in the name of climate change, announcing he will seek billions in damages from five major oil-and-gas companies while moving to divest from fossil fuels.
1540 2018-01-11 21:03:09 Brett are you going to start drinking before you eat just like at every oil board meeting.

1542 2018-01-11 21:02:53 Great question, Alex. I have synthetic oil that only needs to be changed every 10k miles...but no one can reset the system so the icon pops up after 3k miles. Yes, it is incredibly annoying...
1543 2018-01-11 21:02:53 What if the oil that jumps at you while you cook is just as sensitive to the heat as you are and it’s just wanting help

1547 2018-01-11 21:02:43 And the oil company gets? Dreadful graphic.
1548 2018-01-11 21:02:39 Look for much higher gas prices after November. Kochs and Putin cut oil production last month. Their usual strategy is to double down after a defeat. NYC  is suing them and 4 other oil companies.

1551 2018-01-11 21:02:20 ohhhhhh i see i guess this comes from oil spillages as well thank you for explaining you didn’t have to but i appreciate that you did! i learnt something new today!
1552 2018-01-11 21:02:19 Sometimes I feel like we're all being setup by PutinTrump and Un, their in this together, Russia wanted to be the negotiator to earn Goodwill, so USA would bring out the olive branch.Russia and Trumps Team (whose in the Trump Team?) trying to setup military meeting, olive oil.
1553 2018-01-11 21:02:11 Good
1554 2018-01-11 21:01:55 i asked this girl with really good skin what she uses on her face and she told me to use coconut oil do i take her advice
1555 2018-01-11 21:01:48 おはようございます
1556 2018-01-11 21:01:47 Snake oil to debunk ? Good news, I need new toys, old broke too quickly 
1557 2018-01-11 21:01:40 I'm on disability. I JUST now got medicaid assistance for the first time in over 10 years.

1559 2018-01-11 21:01:31 That said, if indeed it proves rather easy to convert the yuan received into gold (remains uncertain as of yet), I suspect it will cause the gold/oil ratio to spike dramatically, and thereby inflict a mortal blow to the petrodollar system.

1563 2018-01-11 21:01:16 Does Vlad think we forgot about their oil exchange with NK out at sea?

1566 2018-01-11 21:00:56 Awesome, thanks! I’ll do some research on these. do you only use the oil at night or as part of your daily routine?
1567 2018-01-11 21:00:55 I'm OK thanks, I don't have any snakes to oil

1569 2018-01-11 21:00:49 I use @deciem's rapeseed oil for overnight. Works same as a night cream , but oil! (I think im seeling it wrong!). In any case.... its the best!!!! #myface

1571 2018-01-11 21:00:40 i know you sometimes have oily skin, so get urban decay’s de-slick!! i have it and it’ll keep your face completely matte and no oil all day
1572 2018-01-11 21:00:31 You support #Fracking and tax cuts for oil companys! You also ignore dangerous air quality all over the UK! You’re ignoring climate change in the pursuit of power and greed!
1573 2018-01-11 21:00:27 There is no legal basis for the lawsuit. On what legal grounds are oil companies liable? These companies legally explored and produced oil and gas and sold it to the marketplace. If the products were so damaging, no one would have bought them. That didn’t happen.
1574 2018-01-11 21:00:24 That's exactly the point of regulations! I've never seen an oil or pesticide company volunteer to truly self regulate when it comes to standards protecting our drinking water or the air we breath. Then again, would we trust them if they did... I think not!
1575 2018-01-11 21:00:18 You can add a little olive oil if the avocado isn't quite as ripe as you'd like. But it's MEANT for using up overripe ingredients anyway.
1576 2018-01-11 21:00:15 If you feel a smell of hot oil, it could mean that oil is leaking onto the exhaust system. To verify the leak, look for oil on the pavement or smoke coming from the engine area. 
*Always be cautious, turn off the engine before checking a leak.

1578 2018-01-11 21:00:14 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1579 2018-01-11 21:00:09 Me and my flatmate have £40 on the electric and in celebration have put both oil heaters on and cackled and chortled like posh people for the last 5 minutes - how to live like the rich when you’re actually just 2 broke bitches.

1585 2018-01-11 20:59:52 Captain Planet? Were your folks oil barons?
1586 2018-01-11 20:59:48 Why haven’t you gotten your oil changed yet???
1587 2018-01-11 20:59:45 how does one keep it from getting covered in oil and cooking gunk? also does it fog? (i have many questions lol)
1588 2018-01-11 20:59:41 The only bonus to this time of year is being to keep some in my car and not having to worry about it melting. I had this stuff in a tube once during the summer. I squeezed it and it not only squirted hot oil on my face it then cooled and practically fused my mouth shut
1589 2018-01-11 20:59:27 They wouldn't but Bob isn't the first to suggest he deserves it...unfortunate for the kid.
1590 2018-01-11 20:59:15 @CNBCClosingBell @JackieDeAngelis Success breed success. The higher #brent/#wti goes, the more likely #oil producers, including #shale, are going to be more discipline in managing supply, at least until new major projects comes on stream
1591 2018-01-11 20:59:04 I’ve never used a night oil, what is it?? #myface
1592 2018-01-11 20:59:03 I've loved the LA Farmers Markets for so many reasons but especially with how happy and actually healthy most of the people are.
It's like a party where we sell health and happiness
And (Nuvo) Olive Oil has a ton to do with my health
1593 2018-01-11 20:59:02 There was that time in the House of Commons when Hedy Fry warned that there were crosses burning in her riding (but that could have been her quoting a Midnight Oil song)
1594 2018-01-11 20:59:02 Well, he's right. Florida has more old people than any other state. He should've gone with that...old people hate oil rigs!
1595 2018-01-11 20:59:01 Perhaps watercolour is more art than acrylics or oil, because the opportunity to correct errors is very limited as the colours are transparent... The sun, wind and temperature influences water-pigment-paper!! Everything flows, painting with watercolors! (Adriana Buggino)
1596 2018-01-11 20:58:46 Tasty though.  Bit of olive oil helps with stickiness for me.

1598 2018-01-11 20:58:12 I agree, we can’t base independence on oil wealth. It’s become integral to Scotland’s wealth as we have a poor business start-up rate, high inequality and so on. But now we’re back at my original point: no oil, England cuts our spending. And there goes this argument for the Union
1599 2018-01-11 20:58:12 Burlingame just got a huge drop! Flower, Pre-rolls, oil, tinctures, and RSO! Come in and check it all out!
1600 2018-01-11 20:58:09 A reversal is near. As with equities its not so important where the final top tick is. What's important to recognize is that the other side of these momentum driven parabolics will be equally steep and perhaps steeper. Not 2008 when oil went from $50 in 2007 to $147 in June 2008.
1601 2018-01-11 20:58:08 My bro changed my oil last night and asked me for $$$ & I thought wow what a ripped off and so I sent him money and went to my room. He then texted me that I sent him too much and he was only joking. Boy, I thought I’ll go broke this week hahahaha
1602 2018-01-11 20:58:01 We've been doing this since New York...we're useless really...where do you get it from?the oil?
1603 2018-01-11 20:57:56 There's a lot of debate around oil, but I think it's time we all recognize that caramel is our greatest natural resource.
1604 2018-01-11 20:57:53 This was unfortunate, but @senorrinhatch single-handedly created the market for such snake oil. Oprah is not perfect, but looks pretty good to me.
1605 2018-01-11 20:57:52 My joints are so stiff right now, I feel like the Tin Man in need of an oil can.
1606 2018-01-11 20:57:49 Getting an oil change so I'm waiting and the music playing is that stupid ass Taylor swift song!

1659 2018-01-11 20:52:15 Low oil prices, defence spending at its lowest as % of GDP, most states being ruled by the same party that rules the centre (health being a state subject)- Indian health sector has(has) many things going for it. For UHC, tinkering won't do.I have great hopes for the election year
1660 2018-01-11 20:51:57 It's a 300 year plus relationship oil has generated positive tax revenues for 30-40. Swings and roundabouts, shows stupidity of basing independence on oil. It was never a bonus, it was always integral to Scotland's spending levels.
1661 2018-01-11 20:51:54 I generally find aqua fine with 1 undercoat 1 gloss. It's the brush damage that annoys me. If your doing a staircase with lots of doors etc then 3 coats isn't cost effective and more work. Unless you price for it. Which I dont! My mind is still set in oil 1 coat of each job done
1662 2018-01-11 20:51:44 I was thinking about this last night.  If oil/gas industry went tits up like coal in WV, OK would be in same boat.  "Leaders" are finally waking up to economic diversification. But should have been working on this when times were flush.  Ok needs to work on it now.
1663 2018-01-11 20:51:35 #HYR getting rather excited with the chart setup on here @NicTrades called it spot on here with support @ 3p and 4.6 and 6.7p next pivot levels. add in rising oil price,increased volume,license deals, best quarter ever this done will light up the portfolio over the coming weeks
1664 2018-01-11 20:51:31 Coal’s time is up and oil’s days are limited. These industries are killing the earth. DJT’s administration is now prepared to destroy our coastlines and beaches with offshore drilling. Destruction due to political greed and fossil fuel industry lobbyists.
1665 2018-01-11 20:51:28 I just spent so much time researching bc it was brought to my attention that my oil diffuser could be toxic to my cat but I’ve concluded that diffusing them is ok but directly applying the oils to the cats skin or anything like that is toxic so I’m in the clear thank goodness
1666 2018-01-11 20:51:22 Sweet oil helps
1667 2018-01-11 20:51:20 Summer so me & @evanthetwerkgod can oil some buns word to LL Cool J Paradise video 
1668 2018-01-11 20:51:19 Why the obsession with oil, a 20th century commodity? Renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels.
1669 2018-01-11 20:51:16 Put clarity oil in my diffuser for my nap. Last time I used it Hannah and I both had a dream we were tripping on acid. Pray for me during my nap.

1675 2018-01-11 20:50:46 On a day when it’s -33 and -40 with the windchill I am so thankful for the oil and gas sector. Without the energy sector, millions of Canadians and those in the northern states would freeze to death.
1676 2018-01-11 20:50:43 He is older. He wants to regress the US back to the day& time he was on top b4  w no env, labor protection regulations. He wants to bring back Nuclear energy. No Way. He wants to pollute our Oceans& Coast with Oil Drilling w his Saudi, Russia &China partners for their profit.
1677 2018-01-11 20:50:41 AIG received an 85 Billion Dollar Bailout from the Bush Admin, followed by 700 Billion Dollar Bank Bailout, On September 29, 2008 the Stockmarket collapses with record 1 day loss, Worldwide Markets begin crashing, Oil dropped to 95$ a Barrel and Gold skyrocketed to 900 oz (2)
1678 2018-01-11 20:50:40 Hydromatic propellers were advance over counterweight, controllable pitch propellers. Oil pressure application to both sides of actuating piston gave increased capacity & capability of feathering/unfeathering by single control knob. Reverse pitch permitted shorter landing roll.
1679 2018-01-11 20:50:33 Until you find oil....
1680 2018-01-11 20:50:22 It's Thursday. Drink some water. Don't drink oil.
1681 2018-01-11 20:50:21 1/2  By "The Big One" I'm not talking about the inevitable oil spill. I mean when people finally realize that his #GOPTaxScam was only truly meant to help the rich (himself, Koch, Adelson)  get richer and keep the rest of us down.
1682 2018-01-11 20:50:15 Let's hope. According to my novice technique, WTI oil will retrace a bit, then either collapse, or take off to the moon (think 75-80). If it collapses, expect it to collapse quickly. Since this took long, the lower 50s would be the goal. But let's just follow Jimbo's arrows :)
1683 2018-01-11 20:50:14 'Do you understand subsets' 
Yes, data on snake oil is a subset of scientific data. There's also another subset of data emanating from Nigeria, the data that leads to questions of why some people there don't know how to release the caps lock.
1684 2018-01-11 20:50:00 @Valvoline fucked up my oil change and didn’t put oil in my car. I emailed them to complain and they have not responded. Don’t go to Valvoline for oil changes they are unprofessional Andy ave terrible customer service!
1685 2018-01-11 20:49:55 “NYC mayor demands oil companies to fire thousands of employees and wants all the mystical magic not oil power from neighboring states.”
1686 2018-01-11 20:49:38 Every Governor needs to replace the state & signature to their own and say Not in our state either! We don't need OIL! We need a POTUS!
1687 2018-01-11 20:49:23 I can’t wait to be oil down & in some water this summer
1688 2018-01-11 20:49:13 What's that other place that's had oil and shit going into their water for years now?
1689 2018-01-11 20:49:12 My room smells like eucalyptus oil and I'm in love
1690 2018-01-11 20:49:11 Palm oil isn't even good for you. It's a shame. Need to figure out ways to get more $$ to people without destroying habitats. Seems like easy $$ talks.
1691 2018-01-11 20:49:05 Why can’t Congress do the same? The whole world understands the devastating effects of off drilling in the ocean. It’s not we haven’t seen it in the US...Deepwater Horizon, Abkutan, 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill. And there’s Exxon Valdez. The ocean hasn’t recovered.
1692 2018-01-11 20:49:00 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
1693 2018-01-11 20:48:39 @foundmyfitness currently taking 3x500 mg krill oil at lunch time daily. Any difference between this and splitting the dose evenly over the course of the day and taking one 500 mg morning lunch dinner?
1694 2018-01-11 20:48:34 150$ oil problem solved in a year, don’t worry beee happy
1695 2018-01-11 20:48:33 OMG I had peppermint oil all overy.hands and now it is on my arms and face and lips........brrrrrr
1696 2018-01-11 20:48:02 I’m happy to see Brent hit 70, it probably won’t hit it again for a loooong time
1697 2018-01-11 20:47:57 An idea for you, @bevel: let subscribers customize the ratio of products in their shipments. I go thru shaving cream way faster than I do oil or balm. #WDYT? /cc:@tristanwalker
1698 2018-01-11 20:47:53 We've switched oil lamps for LEDs, and that's it.
1699 2018-01-11 20:47:49 What's your point. Scotland spends it's oil wealth, Norway also has 3x the oil reserves of the UK.
1700 2018-01-11 20:47:49 Surging oil, surging EUR, surging asset prices. When's the last time I saw this? '07
1701 2018-01-11 20:47:34 shea butter and coconut oil are both natural glycerins and not synthetic and I think that’s the reason it may not dry out skin as bad as chapsticks with glycerin but that’s me just connecting the dots. 
1702 2018-01-11 20:47:29 Why am i excited to get a oil change lol
1703 2018-01-11 20:47:27 I don't want her for president. She traffics in mediocrity, quack science and snake oil, respectability politics. But it's not right that she's getting attacked just because people said she should run

1707 2018-01-11 20:46:58 I know that for an oil painting its nicer to get a ref pic in coulours bc I can practice my colours BUT most of my fav pics of the Donut Gleesome are B&W so uuuh
1708 2018-01-11 20:46:48 never understood why directions for oil absorbing sheets say "...turn over and use the other side.." BIHH THAT THANG IS SEE THROUGH
1709 2018-01-11 20:46:32 psa: if any of y’all live in or near chicago, my mom just found out from a garrett’s popcorn employee that their “butter” popcorn is actually made with coconut oil and is vegan 
1710 2018-01-11 20:46:28 People who cook with excessive amount of oil just upset my soul
1711 2018-01-11 20:46:23 I have just been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver, but I do not drink. I read CBD oil with equal ratio of THC 1:1 has cured/reversed cirrhosis in mice in studies in UK. I also have chronic pain & take pain meds which do not help. Anyone take cbc for liver? @charlotteshemp
1712 2018-01-11 20:46:19 Marlin or monkfish fishing? Nahh. Mermaids or manatee? Nope, that's not it either. Miami Beach oil slicks? NO.! Mar-a-Lago? Bingo!
1713 2018-01-11 20:46:12 Use a conditioning oil in between having lashes applied ie coconut oil or organic castor oil. Your lashes will love you for it xx
1714 2018-01-11 20:46:09 Oil of oregano is fucking AWFUL
1715 2018-01-11 20:46:02 Well, I was gonna wait in the auto center while I’m getting an oil change, but everyone else had the same idea, and I’d rather not deal with people I don’t know 
1716 2018-01-11 20:45:51 Tax treatment is most certainly is not the same across hard minerals vs. oil and gas. The fact that you think it is shows that you don't know anything about the tax code. IDCs are only for oil & gas (and more recently in a limited sense for geothermal drilling).
1717 2018-01-11 20:45:51 No. I won't hurt them. Holy oil is like devils trap but for angels
1718 2018-01-11 20:45:38 I’ve been having a full blown anxiety attack, shaking & everything got 20 minutes and the only thing helping is my cbd oil
1719 2018-01-11 20:45:37 They ALL should get exemptions. We don’t need the oil and we don’t need the risk.
1720 2018-01-11 20:45:33 #sqz all time high breakout supported with volume and the fact that oil has motored after London close suggests that we will see £1 fall very shortly. Even at £1.50 i think it fair to say it is still good value. Easy 100% from here into Q2 #rideyourwinners
1721 2018-01-11 20:45:23 The #USA attack #Iraq and Libya because they were selling their own oil in the Euro and Dinar. Forcing countries to use your dollar or die is criminal and it must be stopped.

1723 2018-01-11 20:45:22 I haven’t found any lip balms or chapsticks that don’t have one or the other and I have naturally dry skin as well as an allergy so I stick to using coconut oil, shea butter or vaseline because I know it doesn’t contain anything bad for my skin.
1724 2018-01-11 20:45:09 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1725 2018-01-11 20:45:07 
You sure it's not roast yam and oil stuffing inside?
1726 2018-01-11 20:45:00 NO EXCUSE....but, just to clarify since I’m Norwegian. Whales feed only on krill...krill is extremely tiny and are not harvested by Norwegians ie we don’t strip the ocean of krill. The wolves are not native, it’s Swedish migrated breed. And we are large oil producers
1727 2018-01-11 20:44:56 Happily for the planet @realDonaldTrump is surrounded by equally incompetent bastards like this idiot @SecretaryZinke who just shot down their own criminal plan to destroy America's oceans with oil drilling. Great fun to watch!

1731 2018-01-11 20:44:31 Hi quick question, can I use say a hyaluronic acid based serum with an oil like rose hip. You know in science oils and water don't mix and because HA serums are humectants could the moisture be blocked from the oil? P.S. I love you 
1732 2018-01-11 20:44:31 This smarmy oil stain doesn’t speak for most of the country - never mind the abject lie that Trump has had a ton of “financial disclosure”. They’re all crooks and liars. Every. Single. One.
1733 2018-01-11 20:44:29 I’m getting my oil changed and this kid in the waiting room is crying so hard he’s gagging....hush little heathen the 70’s on 7 satellite radio station is playing
1734 2018-01-11 20:44:24 Elections in a year, oil at 70. who can imagine what song they are jamming in Abuja right now.
1735 2018-01-11 20:44:13 Oh yes.  Some golden years but hard times too!  (Did you see the BBC documentary about Shane Williams after his retirement?  Fascinating - he went to work for his father in law delivering domestic fuel oil. He was so admirably humble it was quite moving).
1736 2018-01-11 20:44:06 Yes. Saddam tried to sell oil for Euros. Gaddafi wanted to back a pan-African currency with his gold & sell oil. But will we attack China & Russia? Gold-backed ruble,gold-backed yuan or USD backed by debt.
1737 2018-01-11 20:43:59 It’s not all bad… I got the tablets in the cats chicken slices and I’m having coconut oil or honey when I cough and it’s yummy!
1738 2018-01-11 20:43:40 It's called automatic stabilisers, it's a benefit of being part of a political and fiscal union. No questions asked the UK steps in to help regions with issues eg oil price crash. Notice the difference with the Euro when Greece got into trouble?
1739 2018-01-11 20:43:39 @PizzaExpress Loved the happy waitress at Newark tonight! No offering of alternative menu, no asking if everything ok with meals, no asking if would like oil, pepper,parmesan with main! No asking if wanted desert/drinks after! Table 33 @7pm 
1740 2018-01-11 20:43:38 Today, I joined my colleagues in a letter to @SecretaryZinke regarding his latest decision to shield Florida, but not Delaware & other coastal states, from oil & gas drilling along our coastlines.
1741 2018-01-11 20:43:37 I use olive oil now. Trying to stay healthy
1742 2018-01-11 20:43:35 Thanks, so Scotland has more oil to extract and the price will keep rising. So we’ll contribute to the Union and no longer be subsidised, presumably.

On that case, why keep the union? I’m a Scotnat, I don’t Westminster or Brexit. We won’t be any worse off ... 
1743 2018-01-11 20:43:34 Ah so its just a face wash ? And how many times aday do you use it . And is an oil cleanse to remove makeup a similar process? Sorry I'm firing away im just really bored of my routine but my oily + sensitive skin + dry ( eczema) skin combo keeps me playing it safe
1744 2018-01-11 20:43:20 A-dreams are the movies that live  in your head,
Every night even you sleep in your bed.
A-You can dream about riding a horse 
Or you can have a dream about drowning in oil.
Can I just drown in general?
1745 2018-01-11 20:43:11 That's why no oil drilling off Florida Coast? trump and the wealthy Russians giving birth at trump properties don't want to look at oil rigs in the ocean?
1746 2018-01-11 20:43:10 Shit mine too, thats why i been keeping it oiled and braided, im gon send a picture of this good ass oil that will have your shit flowing rs
1747 2018-01-11 20:43:05 However, unlike some colonizers, they went the extra mile by giving back absolutely nothing to those populations. Had oil been discovered under their rule and become significant as it is today, I doubt that would have changed anything.
1748 2018-01-11 20:43:04 That’s not ‘splitting hairs’ so much as it’s simply not reflected in how they vote, ie express their actual values in a way that matters. They vote for Trump, Paul Ryan & Mitch McConnell, and gigantic giveaways to banks & oil & gas.
1749 2018-01-11 20:43:01 They, meaning facebook, google,twitter have a get of of jail free card from deep state. THeir platforms are compromised from day 1. If its service is free, it is not.

Giving it a shot! Love to hear your experience.
1752 2018-01-11 20:42:41 HBO's #Succession reminds me of when Bobby and J.R. fought over Ewing Oil when Jock died, except a whole lot more f-bombs and of course, a lot more serious. Looks very well done.
1753 2018-01-11 20:42:38 You can really tell the difference once u get a oil change
1754 2018-01-11 20:42:36 You're gonna need to do better than that since your #GOPTaxScam repealed the requirement that oil companies contribute to a Oil Disaster Relief fund to cover the cost of another Deep Water Horizon. WHEN it happens again, someone will need to pay for it. Mexico?
1755 2018-01-11 20:42:32 Jeff Belskus on @FoxSports975 - "Lucas Oil Stadium is a great facility but a deal with them for @IndyEleven to play in there wouldn't be a long term solution"
1756 2018-01-11 20:42:31 oil into the 70s and no sign of a pullback just yet...exposure to oil is pivotal in 2018. I can think of no better ones than #SQZ #SDX #HYR all fully funded and due a big move this quarter.

1760 2018-01-11 20:42:18 Following the arrival of oil cocoa farming in Nigeria dwindled as people, and the government, became more interested in oil. As a result, the country’s finances were focused in that direction. #Cocoa

1763 2018-01-11 20:42:13 I'm sorry they're going through hard times but what the fuck did they expect when they voted for this traitorous con artist? It's not like he wasn't facing a class action suit by students from his "university" during the election. Sadly, snake oil is a bitter thing to swallow

1766 2018-01-11 20:42:03 To remove residual oil from the catalyst, they blow steam through the catalyst which strips it all off ready for the catalyst to go through the regenerator.

1768 2018-01-11 20:41:55 He sells snake oil!
1769 2018-01-11 20:41:50 The real question is: who would I be without my essential oil diffuser?
1770 2018-01-11 20:41:42 I had peppermint oil on my finger and then proceeded to remove a contact lense, great, just great.

3, $vix in positive, up 1$ since the low while ignoring a strong bullish market,

1775 2018-01-11 20:41:11 Based on price increases never being rolled back after they raised prices because of higher shipping costs.  If that happens again any tax cut you might receive will be handed right back to the Deep State Globalists running the BIG OIL.  #MAGA that

1776 2018-01-11 20:41:00 We see natural gas stocks as very cheap and oil stocks as relatively expensive. We recommend selling the oily names and buying the cheap natural gas stocks.
1777 2018-01-11 20:40:57 Does that include some form of punishment for the Russians who sold NK oil recently? Or is that ok because trump is buddies with Putin?
1778 2018-01-11 20:40:55 It's all about the oil
1779 2018-01-11 20:40:51 and do a hot oil treatment lmfaoooo
1780 2018-01-11 20:40:49 Agreed. Just this: "But earlier...[he said] I am for massive oil and gas and everything else, and a lot of energy," he said. "Hillary, my opponent, was for windmills, and she was for other types of energy that don't have the same capacities at this moment certainly.' "

1791 2018-01-11 20:39:43 The governors and civil servants will now have more funds to play around with while the masses may now have to pay more for imported fuel.
Government does not inform us when the prices of motor oil and lubricants go up.
1792 2018-01-11 20:39:40 Coconut oil prob right??
1793 2018-01-11 20:39:36 Honestly, they’re lapping it up. Usual shit...end London rule now, where’s our oil fund, Norway has one blah blah blah 
1794 2018-01-11 20:39:27 LOL AT THE MAN WHO TOLD ME MY CAR WAS BROKE... all I needed was a new oil filter... I went in for a oil change

A ban is long overdue!
1801 2018-01-11 20:39:05 May the Oil dry up in Nigeria... So people can use their heads,  creative ingenuity instead of relying on a rent seeking model to run a corrupt economy...!! 

India makes more money from ICT alone in one year than NIGERIA "earns" from oil!
1802 2018-01-11 20:39:04 I think that's a statement that both leavers and remainers both ring with my friend. I have no issue with eurosceptics, just snake oil salesman like farage who isn't interested in anyone but himself
1803 2018-01-11 20:39:04 I see argan oil in the Infusium23. What does the Bio Care Labs Body Butter smell like? 
1804 2018-01-11 20:38:55 Constantly drying out my face my skin doesn’t have to work overtime with the oil production so lately my skin’s just been looking supple and fresh - it’s too lit! I’ve been using the Toleriane range from La Roche Posay
1805 2018-01-11 20:38:54 I’m surprised that the Dems would agree to cover oil spill damage that will be caused by the ANWR amendment you blackmailed @SenMajLdr with for your #taxscam vote.
1806 2018-01-11 20:38:47 When an oil change turns into a 170$ bill smh
1807 2018-01-11 20:38:45 Why the #Oil are 28th: Obviously there’s a lot of blame to be passed around, but no matter which player(s) you blame, be sure to include the Edmonton media for pointing out their shortcomings & hurting their feelings. #Oilers #SuckItUpButtercup
1808 2018-01-11 20:38:44 Hi that’s correct, while the oil price is low Scotland’s a net receiver of UK funds. However if the oil never recovers it becomes a permanent subsidy. Why should England pay for our higher spending just to keep us from leaving? They’ll cut it. Unless I’m being mental. Cheers
1809 2018-01-11 20:38:32 Obama only added jobs cause of planet parenthood and oil field Trump actuall builds business to grow for more work
1810 2018-01-11 20:38:32 Done!
1811 2018-01-11 20:38:22 Finally caught a short on #OIL ... what a run it had $USO , $UWT , $DWT
1812 2018-01-11 20:38:20 We actually do print money. Nations buy treasuries so they have access 2 USD 2 buy oil. That's how we borrow money. We've printed a lot-that's what quantitative easing is. If petro yuan takes off,won't be near as much demand for USD.
1813 2018-01-11 20:38:06 My step father got me and my sister unprepared  I’ve never in my 31 years had to get a oil change  she just started pumping her own gas like 5 years ago 
1814 2018-01-11 20:38:04 Well some people are just too stupid to get it. Like the cost miners thinking mines were going to be opened back up. They shut them down to drive cost up. I seen this first hand in the box business. Yup management bragged about it too each other. Oil refineries did too.
1815 2018-01-11 20:38:00 Funniest thing ever asked a taxi driver was he free at the garage and he said ya hop in, inside the car then he goes "do ya mind if I ring an escort" hahaha spent the whole journey then talking to me about baby oil and fingering asses
1816 2018-01-11 20:37:58 Everyone knows u gotta coconut oil the baby for some reason.
1817 2018-01-11 20:37:54 Shampoo can be a little aggressive, if you use shampoo I'd only use it no more than 2x/wk.  Good rinsing otherwise is fine.  Beard oil would be especially key on the days you wash it, but most would use beard oil every day to keep skin/hair healthy as it grows.

1819 2018-01-11 20:37:28 Miss Lube Rack 1955? Needs her tires inflated first, oil checekd and wash the winders and grease all the ZERT fittings.
1820 2018-01-11 20:37:23 It will be worse because of "permanent" corporate tax cuts and wrecking our influence in the global markets. Trump is favoring bug oil to apoease Putin. I can guarantee there are back door deals. Tillerson dying to get back in the ExxonMobil game.. Putin or no Putin.
1821 2018-01-11 20:37:17 This is so stupid, he isnt touching because they are on a shooting range, he MAYBE had oíl in HIS hands. IDIOTA.
1822 2018-01-11 20:37:08 If Tehran & Iran don't cease oil contracts in middle East then I'll never be able start hybrids market to make flying vehicles which is why U.S.A invaded to find oil not just Saddam & those supremists were running from paying reparations to segregated south & trying cover it up
1823 2018-01-11 20:37:07 You have one of the largest reserves selling oil on the market at 55+ a barrel it costs you less than a couple of bucks a barrel to produce it and you can't pay your bills? Next time elect an accountant.
1824 2018-01-11 20:37:07 . @realDonaldTrump   These monopolies are MUCH MORE influential, much more dangerous than standard Oil ever was. Google, You tube, Twitter, Facebook Must be BUSTED UP.

1827 2018-01-11 20:36:48 I have like an entire liter thing of olive oil
Do I just take it with me while I cook
Do I take a little of it in a bottle cap or something 
I just want to make gyoza
1828 2018-01-11 20:36:46 Since you have been telling us about these amazing products I think my best fit would be sheabutter & Almond oil 
1829 2018-01-11 20:36:39 This smarmy, snarky snake oil salesman would last about three minutes in any bar he walked into.

1833 2018-01-11 20:36:12 What Pelosi, a 1%er, calls crumbs is a much needed car repair, another tank of oil in this bitterly cold winter.  Crumbs??? That's an insult to the average American worker.
1834 2018-01-11 20:36:09 @realDonaldTrump The plan to allow Oil Drilling  in our coastal  Waters is wrong.   The waters are something America loves and we have not forgotten Deep Water Horizon mess..@thehill @TheLeadCNN
1835 2018-01-11 20:35:50 As I said, with depressed prices oilsands oil will be most at risk. Whatever causes low prices, Alberta will be affected most. That's the reality that the local industry must face.
1836 2018-01-11 20:35:49 Freeze ...How much have you made from your cry against tithe  ???? You can say whatever you like. People that have seen the benefits of tithe will never stop because of your dropping like oil . Change your game ....
1837 2018-01-11 20:35:45 We are the only country not to receive revenue from oil produced on our territory....please explain as this doesn’t make sense to me This Government has done more to close tax loopholes but if there is more to gain  I think Jezza has already spent any money from that source
1838 2018-01-11 20:35:44 Nope! I bought two oil diffusers the other day
1839 2018-01-11 20:35:36 I need a heavier moisturizer cause this ain’t cutting it. I was mixing vitamin E oil in it, but I’m bout to switch to my avocado oil cause it’s more moisturizing.
1840 2018-01-11 20:35:32 Planned to change my oil when I got home from work and now it’s starting to rain. There goes that plan.
1841 2018-01-11 20:35:19 Eliminating new “eyesores” significantly reduces the potential for another catastrophic oil spill which would be devastating to tourism. We’ll take that tourism exemption too.
1842 2018-01-11 20:35:17 It’s morbidly humorous that rich New Englanders blocked a project which would allow windmills to be installed off the coast bc they would be unsightly and Trump in a fell swoop allowed oil rigs to be placed there
1843 2018-01-11 20:35:17 Holy oil. Just in case. It would only stop them for a while
1844 2018-01-11 20:34:59 Coconit oil is literally a godsend
1845 2018-01-11 20:34:59 Try putting a bad tasting oil or lip balm on them, I used to but the skin around my nails and put hand sanitizer on all the time to stop so if it tastes gross you won’t wanna bit

1848 2018-01-11 20:34:35 If you want some more stats about this:

A barrel of Oil is roughly 42 gallons.
On average, about 30 gallons of that is turned into petrol and diesel, that will vary on demand.

In litres, that's about 136 litres of automotive fuel.
Extraction cost a barrel ~ $15 and dropping.
1849 2018-01-11 20:34:34 U will certainly need help when oil rigs spill oil on your shores! And U helped to eliminate the OIL FLUSH FUND that cleans up oil spills!
1850 2018-01-11 20:34:32 Bout F’n time....seriously! @realDonaldTrump selling #MAGA products like he works in a carnival....just goes with his snake oil gig in the WH #TrumpDisgustingPig #TrumpConspired #TrumpRussia #TrumpCrimeFamily #TrumpDumbAss #TrumpLies

1858 2018-01-11 20:33:43 Getting an oil changed turned into getting my serpentine belt replaced because why wouldn’t it 
1859 2018-01-11 20:33:38 i don't necessarily disagree with you, i just think its an easy 'poster' to pick a hole in. you just need to look at Norway to see how different it could have been...but we weren't in charge of our indigenous assets when the oil started to flow (and still aren't) 
1860 2018-01-11 20:33:36 Anyone on my oil team:
If you are interested in attending oil rally on Saturday... Message me!
1861 2018-01-11 20:33:28 Up? You mean halfway back to where they need to be, hopefully...Counting on oil being up for the next decade is a fools errand we have had front row seats of for 15 ys  + a $15B FIASCO. Oil may tank below 30 before the yr is out David. The energy world is changing quickly.#nlpoli
1862 2018-01-11 20:33:20 China was providing oil to NK as was Russia. US now a weakened force politically, so it's up to political chess players to keep Kim on side, rather than provoke him. As Putin indicated, Kim has weapons that can go anywhere on the globe.
1863 2018-01-11 20:33:18 Wow!! This #organic #passionfruit oil smells JUST like the fruit ! Just used some straight on my #naturalhair and I’m ! Can’t wait until the new line of products based on #maracuja come out later. #itibabeauty #skincare #haircare
1864 2018-01-11 20:33:07 Thats false. Do some reserach on Norwegian oil service companies. The oil prize drop has made us Very efficient. We can handle a lower oil prize than you guys, to be break Even in our oil fields

1866 2018-01-11 20:33:06 Democrats punching hard to keep recession at bay. Economy depends on how fast 45 is removed. DOW high numbers are effectively meaningless. Watch Brent ICE oil numbers.

1870 2018-01-11 20:32:25 There's probably some oil in there somewhere. Time to drill.
1871 2018-01-11 20:32:22 I'm thinking maybe next year of doing a signature oil for the clinic, if my budget allows,  that I can use on clients and sell. Truthfully, I have a terrible sense of smell, but I assume my clients don't!

1880 2018-01-11 20:31:46 Try castor oil, hair oil, yet evaded justice.
1881 2018-01-11 20:31:42 Baby ill never go that long without getting my oil changed again. Smh
1882 2018-01-11 20:31:35 Is the oil price up because of you?
1883 2018-01-11 20:31:35 My hands always dry from washing, hands in the water a lot. Consistent on vit D (doc says low), sometimes fish oil (I think it helps my vision). Exercise is always a winner, you have to do some+ of that. No penicillin for me, allergic to it. Just try 2 avoid getting sick, injured

1885 2018-01-11 20:31:29 So my question is now that oil is $70 and fx reserves is $40b... is the Naira not undervalued at N360/$. We had an 80% devaluation from 199 to 360.

1890 2018-01-11 20:31:03 You know those wealthy aristocrats that belong to Mar-a-Lago do not want to see any dirty oil rigs while they’re enjoying that marvelous, wonderful, the best ever chocolate cake they serve there.
1891 2018-01-11 20:31:01 Isn’t this a bit absurd? You support policies that are destroying the environment and contributing to Climate Change carnage and then you want the tax payers to pick the bill while Big Oil profits? Why not tax Fossil Fuel and let them pay for the destruction they are causing?
1892 2018-01-11 20:31:00 Just boycott the evil oil/gas Companies! Turn off your meters and put in your solar system, and cancel your electric accounts! 
 Really show them you  are serious for Change! Power to the people
1893 2018-01-11 20:30:59 ahahahah dude the oil price just rallied for the last 2 years :)
1894 2018-01-11 20:30:45 The debate is just whether oil spills will cost some rich donors more than drilling will benefit other rich donors. Public interest and health and the environment don’t even bear consideration. Certainly not for FL Gov Rick “I won’t say the words ‘climate change’ “ Scott.
1895 2018-01-11 20:30:45 Coconut oil
1896 2018-01-11 20:30:44 Opening the Bakken back up hurt the oil side. 

Will be interesting to see how it shakes out
1897 2018-01-11 20:30:41 And the way the price of a barrel oil is skyrocketing that increase in take home pay will go right into the gas tank. Its a no win for WE THE PEOPLE.
1898 2018-01-11 20:30:25 Is the CBD oil helping you?
1899 2018-01-11 20:30:02 Everyone’s coconut oil in Cape Town has melted. This heat is unbearable.
1900 2018-01-11 20:29:55 Hey New Yorkers, do you think if comrade Bill de Blasio is successful in suing five major oil companies for billions of dollars for causing "global warming" that you might see gasoline and heating oil/natural gas prices shoot up?

(Asking for a friend who drives & heats his home)
1901 2018-01-11 20:29:52 Wealth will vanish as an issue as automation reduces manufacturing costs to near zero. There will still be the very wealthy, but stuff will be so cheap it will be basically free. Think of shareware that builds a car out of a vat of oil and some metal.
1902 2018-01-11 20:29:49 You really are a POS

Yeah, lets keep funding ISIS with Saudi oil, and then Tax Washington State residents for using blood money oil. Why not be self dependent america that does not support oil from people who throws gays off of buildings and beat their wives in the street,
1903 2018-01-11 20:29:38 the episode of Parks and Rec where they go to Lucas Oil Stadium is the best episode. don’t fight me on this.

1905 2018-01-11 20:29:33 Or used cooking oil. 
1906 2018-01-11 20:29:19 why is the political guy talking oil?
1907 2018-01-11 20:29:18 That feeling when you get an oil change and the check engine light goes off 
1908 2018-01-11 20:29:17 I suspect we'll be seeing a second big arrow down soon. Oil already defied the first big arrow down. I doubt it'll escape a second one.
1909 2018-01-11 20:29:10 The amount of vitamin C serum and almond oil that I have put on my face..I better not ever age.
1910 2018-01-11 20:28:37 I owe it all to my pit crew. They actually taught me a pretty cool trick. You know how motor oil is viscous and slow moving? Well, next time you change your oil don't replace it with more slow oil. Replace it with gasoline, it makes your engine run turbo fast a lot smoother.
1911 2018-01-11 20:28:33 no salt or oil and raw but surprisingly sweet and super rich peanut flavor......they are insanely good.
1912 2018-01-11 20:28:28 It's still dropping some what after pit close. Maybe the algos got triggered in the reverse direction once Brent hit 70. At least I hope so.
1913 2018-01-11 20:28:14 Misfits, INXS, Midnight Oil. That’ll do.
1914 2018-01-11 20:28:11 Take from one end and then the other end until you only have the middle left.
1915 2018-01-11 20:28:08 Thats what i was fuckin thinkin ! I get my oil changed somewhere else tf
1916 2018-01-11 20:28:05 I use the confit method most times, I just modify it - Slow deep frying in seasoned oil.

It has to be frozen though.
1917 2018-01-11 20:28:04 Yeah, I stick to the exfoliating rule and have a variety of masks I use a couple times a week. I’ve actually been looking for an night time oil but haven’t figured out what to try yet! What do you use?
1918 2018-01-11 20:27:57 North Sea oil at the time not got that income now
1919 2018-01-11 20:27:50 Steven - when do you think State legislatures, Congress will fine oil companies, coal companies trillions of dollars dealing with Medicaid, Medicare?  Pollution increases health care costs children with asthma, people with heart/lung, etc
1920 2018-01-11 20:27:45 But from whom does 711 but their gas? Looking for an oil company not in bed with tRump is hopeless
1921 2018-01-11 20:27:36 It makes my face glow lol I also use argan oil, I never thought I’d stumble across using oils for that but it’s so great 
1922 2018-01-11 20:27:28 Todays close was encouraging
1923 2018-01-11 20:27:24 Standard Oil, can be boycotted too
1924 2018-01-11 20:27:18 We can't have globs of oil washing up on the shores of Mar-A-Lago now can we?
1925 2018-01-11 20:27:10 From the fetchers of Cod Liver Oil
1926 2018-01-11 20:27:05 Went with Jesses sister to get Jesses brothers trucks oil changed. He had an appointment at 1:30 and it’s now 3:30 and it’s still not done. How?????
1927 2018-01-11 20:27:04 We haven't set that oil tracker on fire and we're not killing the crew but it doesn't mean that we should let them die. We are morally obliged to save them.

1928 2018-01-11 20:26:58 When yuh see we coming down is ole oil and a duttyyyy buckett 
1929 2018-01-11 20:26:52 Perhaps the smart thing to do but the NatGas candle going into the close is a screamer imho. A nice long candle closing at the high. Could blow thru resistance tomorrow. Sitting tight. Already swimming in oil shorts.

1931 2018-01-11 20:26:45 Must disappoint - the 'poster' isn't mine, hence neither is the research behind it. But it doesn't matter. The oil is stolen, for deacdes squandered on 'taming' legal unions, (sod the Tolpuddle martyrs) paying unemployment benefit to millions, and funding wars in Middle-East.
1932 2018-01-11 20:26:44 rubbing oil all over myself is cute and all but i’d rather you do it.
1933 2018-01-11 20:26:42 hmm im not familiar with this product. If you have dry skin, I'd only exfoliate 2x a week with a high quality exfoliate. i'd also recommend using an oil on your face on night - i started using this amazing night cream 2x a week and it makes a huge difference
1934 2018-01-11 20:26:25 oh oh i know this one
he wasn't rusted, he just had gunk in his joints due to lack of proper maintenance. That's why all it took was some oil to solve the problem

Graves Blasts Interior’s “Double Standard” on OCS Energy Production, which excludes oil exploration in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
1936 2018-01-11 20:26:14 Y’all ever tried shaving with coconut oil  try it , skin be so soft 
1937 2018-01-11 20:26:11 to anyone interested in feeding my essential oil addiction, I am now taking donations!
1938 2018-01-11 20:26:02 Dude Coconut oil just changed the game, why didn't I try this sooner 
1939 2018-01-11 20:25:58 Y’all who love natural oil defusers hope you know that certain oils are really harmful towards certian animals like if a dog or cat shouldn’t eat the plant obviously putting the oils into the air are very poisonous/ dangerous!! Look into it before you fill your house with it!!
1940 2018-01-11 20:25:46 LOLOLOL  Carbage & processed toxic oil spill contamination which may be one of the root causes of IR.
1941 2018-01-11 20:25:45 I’m the only bitch in the world where witch hazel and tea tree oil doesn’t completely clear my skin.
1942 2018-01-11 20:25:23 I already take a lot of these. Fish Oil, too, helps w/ imflammation. And I've been taking Boswellia/TurmericCurcumin together for better effects. Boswellia is great for inflammation/arthritis. 
1943 2018-01-11 20:25:22 Google it. Just be aware that CBD oil may somehow be in a conservative algorithm category, so no telling what will return with the query.
1944 2018-01-11 20:25:20 I haven’t tried that one yet! You like it?? I use argan oil, camellia seed oil and some vitamin C oil and I LOVE!
1945 2018-01-11 20:25:14 I agree however doing that you completely ignore that we are in unprecedented times. What other stage in history have 3 quite average teams in their leagues been propelled to the upper echelons over night by Far East/Russian oil
1946 2018-01-11 20:25:12 We have the Bretton Woods agreement & creation of petro $. We are now faced with threat of gold-back yuan 4 oil contracts. Shanghai energy exchange opens Jan. 18. Can be sovereign but doesn't mean value of $ will hold. We've been living off the printing press
1947 2018-01-11 20:25:11 In FCCU you use two fluidised beds. One is fed with air and one is fed with steam. One bed cleans coke off the catalyst and the other performs the cracking action of the oil.
1948 2018-01-11 20:25:11 i have this cake mix at my house tha tis gonna expire. 

Tonight, I'm baking cakes. 

If I have enough butter and oil....
1949 2018-01-11 20:25:02 Don’t go there if you’re allergic to nuts. They fry the chips in nut oil apparently.
1950 2018-01-11 20:24:54 Same as the theories that cannabis oil can kill cancer cells and alleviate pain, they can't make money on what we can grow or forage for ourselves, the rich stay healthy, the sick stay poor
1951 2018-01-11 20:24:50 I got the olive oil wash and it smells amazing! #SuaveBeliever
1952 2018-01-11 20:24:50 Steven - do something useful.  Discuss welfare to Corporate Welfare Queens - trillions of dollars a year more than is spent on military, Social Security each year.  Corporate Welfare queens - banks, oil, coal, cable, prescription drugs, etc.  IMF Externalities on net
1953 2018-01-11 20:24:42 The lifting of the ban on selling domestic oil was also lifted in 2016 which makes all this off shore drilling financially beneficial.
1954 2018-01-11 20:24:23 I LOOOOVE grapefruit oil in my water too!! Yum! 
1955 2018-01-11 20:24:20 They are very good in eggs. I simmer Bell peppers and onions in olive oil then add ham and shredded colby jack and scramble it up with eggs. Perfect breakfast.
1956 2018-01-11 20:24:19 I blended Shea Butter and Coconut oil into a beautiful cake batter consistency and I’m so obsessed, I rub that all over me and walk around like a Goddess all day 
1957 2018-01-11 20:24:17 I live in TEXAS....we are begging you sir, PLEASE HELP US!  Our jobs have been taken by the Hispanic population.  I am a Mgr of Oil & Gas Co, all of our contractors us Mexican's.  Those were at one time a good job for American men!
1958 2018-01-11 20:24:14 Just saying that your tweet suggests that "share" goes to England solely and not to central government. In other words that Wales and N. Ireland aren't benefiting from NS Oil. I'm not questioning the sentiment behind it.

1960 2018-01-11 20:24:07 may 2018 be the year that people realize coconut oil is not good for your skin and companies stop putting it in everything
1961 2018-01-11 20:23:56 一時間ごとに起きてる…(´△｀)
1962 2018-01-11 20:23:56 The problem is not oil. Plenty to go round. It's how it's traded and the corruption around it.
1963 2018-01-11 20:23:52 I need sum oil for my chest congestion
1964 2018-01-11 20:23:30 I don't feel like I should have to tell the dealer that my @ChevyElectric Bolt doesn't need an oil change. #ElectricVehicle #ChevyBolt
1965 2018-01-11 20:23:30 i'm not sure this can be accurate. part of the $68 is the extraction cost. Part is profit which goes to the owner - i.e the oil company consortium and part of it will be paid to HMRC in PRT. do your %'s reference the total tax take on each barrel?
1966 2018-01-11 20:23:23 The Boredom of waiting while my car is getting a oil change kills me every time.
1967 2018-01-11 20:23:14 What would a flipdog have on top? Adobo oil? 
1968 2018-01-11 20:23:10 Coconut oil may reduce risk of heart disease, finds new study
1969 2018-01-11 20:23:05 No offense,  Sir but it looks like synthetic hair deep fried in oil and some fake nails sprinkled on it.
1970 2018-01-11 20:22:59 This would be a great oil painting! BTW, you nail with with your characters on Black Mirror.
1971 2018-01-11 20:22:56 How much are oil changes? Cause my dealership just told me $70 
1972 2018-01-11 20:22:55 Full tank of oil; yassssss! #paydayvibes 
1973 2018-01-11 20:22:51 When u use veg oil to fry it n use red oil to eat it, walahi it's d best
1974 2018-01-11 20:22:40 You mean say, fisheries disasters caused by off shored oil accidents? Yeah ...
1975 2018-01-11 20:22:40 Local democracy, animal rights and the environment. Now I know why he loves Venezuela. A repressive oil producer whose animal welfare is described as extremely poor by VACI.
1976 2018-01-11 20:22:37 I know we disagree on policy, but these are facts. Oil reached over $150 under Henry. From 2006 to 2014, the price stayed mostly over $80. The feds pumped out big stimulus in 2009-10. The effect was to spike state spending, and to guarantee hard times on the other side.
1977 2018-01-11 20:22:34 @NYCMayor Have you banned all methods of fossil fuel use- all means of motorized transportation, plastics, insect repellant, flower pots, etc? You want Big Oil to pay, yet you continue to use their products daily.
1978 2018-01-11 20:22:24 So fucking cold the Coco oil in my beard frozen stiff
1979 2018-01-11 20:22:24 That's a lie!  Trump owns property in Florida. He did it for his own guarantees against another oil disaster!  LIAR!!
1980 2018-01-11 20:22:16 Except literally a body hates asthma, lung disease and cancer. And modern civilized society hates oil spills and a dependency on foreign oil. So I think your analogy doesn't really hold...
1981 2018-01-11 20:21:48 Remind everyone where you stood on Arctic drilling when Obama approved it and the Shell Oil Co had a drilling rig parked in Puget Sound for months until the Native Americans managed to get Shell to back off.

1984 2018-01-11 20:21:39 You can try Hair wonder cream or oil
1985 2018-01-11 20:21:36 Would you concede there are huge tax breaks designed to benefit the oil industry?
1986 2018-01-11 20:21:31 What about those vitamins? vitamin C is usually what I take with fish oil lol
1987 2018-01-11 20:21:17 I’m cooking for my little brother and the oil is fucking jumping onto my body and this little ass fag decides to ask” is the food ready , you’re slow as hell”  smh

 sometimes it be your own niggas I swear
1988 2018-01-11 20:21:17 the feel when your local car place decides the best course of action in changing your oil and fixing your oil pan is to 1) not tell you it's hanging on by a single screw and 2) to patch it with fucking SILICONE
1989 2018-01-11 20:21:11 Lol 300k bbl per day were moved out from the category crude oil and are classified as Natural Gas Plant Liquids. Crude oil production will be staying lower.
1990 2018-01-11 20:21:10 Lol brah, it was like it had a spoon of castor oil.
1991 2018-01-11 20:21:07 We know you are against #USA1st and rather have the US buy oil from ppl who support terrorism.
What you don't know... you are a member of the losing party... @TheDemocrats
1992 2018-01-11 20:21:07 American are counting on this Administration to make America #energyindependent not higher oil prices. @SecretaryPerry @SecretaryZinke @EPAScottPruitt @realDonaldTrump @VP @PressSec
1993 2018-01-11 20:21:02 Oil companies are going to rain on your parade stop the bleeding please.
1994 2018-01-11 20:21:00 You have to “massage” it with coarse salt. Really. A little olive oil + lemon juice and you’d like it despite yourmisgivings.
1995 2018-01-11 20:21:00 I remember the argument that their ideal is based off of human fat ratios, but the seed oil recommendations seems at odds with it. It’s cheaper & people tend to use in cooking a lot (vs olive oil, used more for cold seasoning)

Seed oils are also unecesary to mimick human fat %
1996 2018-01-11 20:20:57 Today The USA's capacity to crack oil in this method is 6 million Barrels a day.... just 35% of the required amount per day in the US.
1997 2018-01-11 20:20:44 Kindly use the Kpone route to Kpone barrier or  the Michelle camp  Saki route when going in or  out of comm. 25, Dawhenya or Prampram. There's an oil spill from an overturned fuel tanker  that has caused a lot of traffic and also poses a lot of danger.
1998 2018-01-11 20:20:42 no plan whatsoever by the government to diversify the economy 

they can't think beyond crude oil price
1999 2018-01-11 20:20:40 @markhumphrys hey Mark, what is the best argument you have against people claiming the iraq war was "for oil"? I've seen some people bringing it up lately. Include links from your site.
2000 2018-01-11 20:20:35 It’ll probably get crunchy bc of the protein in it. Coconut oil also congeals when cooled. Would not advise
2001 2018-01-11 20:20:27 Today has been a productive day  spoiled my car:filled my gas tank, oil changed & a detailed wash. Took babe out to lunch, bought myself & nayelee a lil something

2003 2018-01-11 20:20:18 I would contribute to a fund to anchor an oil tanker off Mar-a-Lago.

2008 2018-01-11 20:20:02 I'm just now using the oil diffuser robbie's mom got me for Christmas. Isn't that ironic? Don't you think?
2009 2018-01-11 20:20:01 OR - & just go with me on this for a sec - one of us is an undercover operative financed by Middle Eastern royalty/Big Oil.
2010 2018-01-11 20:20:00 No only bc coconut oil is solid at room temp which means it’s gon be solid at room temp in your baby locs. I’d use almond or olive oil. Literally anything else and only a lil of it. This only advice for ppl who don’t want super neat looking baby locs tho... couldn’t be me tho 
2011 2018-01-11 20:19:56 He was big, like Notorious B.I.G big. Black as oil and his teeth were yellow. I was minding my own business when he whistled at me. He was telling me to smile like there was something wrong me. I just wanted to buy groceries in peace.

2016 2018-01-11 20:19:40 Far out in gfc when oil was 100 bucks a barrel the price of gas here was not much higher than it is now . When it was thirty bucks a barrel it wasn't much lower than what we pay now .@JudithCollinsMP and bs reports did nothing
2017 2018-01-11 20:19:24 1. No it doesn't.
2. American citizens don't want you to 
3. Oil is a has been fuel source. Renewable is cheaper, better
4. If you want to invest in energy's future, try solar and wind

There. Fixed your ad for you. You're welcome.
2018 2018-01-11 20:19:21 @ErikaLipton, oil money wants to destroy American democracy.  These scandals are manufactured by Fox and Breitbart.  Murdoch and the Koch brothers are making billions at the expense of American citizens and they've scrambled the truth every way they can.

2023 2018-01-11 20:18:26 @realDonaldTrump Great job getting the awesome Tax Bill. Looks like our tax savings are going to oil companies. I thought we were going to be free of a foreign oil pricing structure with our energy independence. Oil companies are going to profit more economy less across the board
2024 2018-01-11 20:18:18 Is it just me or does everyone see how run down and beleaguered the Dimms look on and off camera.  They are grasping at things with oil slick hands.  Like this post and follow me at @wealthslowly

2039 2018-01-11 20:17:00 Timely legislation to accompany the recently approved allowances for bicoastal offshore oil drilling.  The chances of a fisheries disaster have increased dramatically, especially when added to rising  ocean temperatures.
2040 2018-01-11 20:16:53 They've cut their costs by cutting labour and improving extraction technology I would think. That'll be why the oil companies are raking it in and oil workers are not getting back to a job.
2041 2018-01-11 20:16:51 Don't worry - the Chinese will continue to pump oil out of the fields in those international waters. Can't have "unsightly" rigs that you MIGHT be able to see with top of the line binocs

Although many segments of the economy are market driven, other sectors are not, such as health care, oil & natural resource extraction.
2059 2018-01-11 20:15:43 I have combination skin so e/o day. I lather it up & use only cold water to wash it off. I let my face airdry then apply organic coconut oil.
2060 2018-01-11 20:15:42 It’s called 21 day Daniel fast it’s for church basically I don’t eat meat . Its strictly home grown fruits and veggies . Like one meal I eat is potatoes veggies and soy chorizo. I can only use pure pepper and sea salt as seasoning and olive oil to cook . I’m dying 
2061 2018-01-11 20:15:28 Even yesterday no major queue, bought at Forte oil opposite Transcorp Hilton, was shocked when I wanted to top my fuel at same place this evening

2064 2018-01-11 20:15:22 Oil change scheduled for today -- an hour sitting in a quiet waiting room with plushy chairs where they offer me free lattes, granola bars, and Wi-Fi, where no one can find me. I really shouldn't love my car mechanic this much. It's indecent.
2065 2018-01-11 20:15:17 My dumbass is so high I thought I was losing my eyesight in one eye but the lens of my glasses was just blurry bc of coconut oil
2066 2018-01-11 20:15:05 FFS AGAIN,I take it you know of the atlantic ridge and Claire oil fields coming online?
It just astounds me that you can`t grasp how wealthy Scotland is?,you think England pays for us,ask yourself would you keep a lodger who didn't pay you anything?
As you said "why should they"

2070 2018-01-11 20:14:55 tRump criticizes HRC over ‘her love of windmills’. Perhaps he should consider those instead of oil drilling along the cost for energy generation.
EVERYWHERE.
2071 2018-01-11 20:14:54 Idk if I'm just getting my oil changed, Founder's Day is approaching and I'm wearing my letters.
2072 2018-01-11 20:14:50 Avocado oil is good for your skin. And avocados are pretty tasty too. Good choice @SuaveBeauty #SuaveBeliever
2073 2018-01-11 20:14:49 It must be required that all Super Giant oil fields not yet producing in Utah and Nevada are put into full production prior to opening of #ANWAR or lifting ban on offshore outside of gulf. Too much petroleum ready to be produced in continental US.
2074 2018-01-11 20:14:45 Governor wey get oil for head...I love this man...the man no dey carry last
2075 2018-01-11 20:14:37 I always feel like such a big girl coming to change the oil and all that truck shit lol 
2076 2018-01-11 20:14:33 Oil is rallying faster than the euro - so oil is more inflationary for Europe than for the US

2078 2018-01-11 20:14:25 I want to be a friend of Court in New York when they sue the living shit out of those oil companies that are polluting the world. Lol
2079 2018-01-11 20:14:17 More money needed for R&D, policy makers to make relevant decisions/implement legislation and a will from a lot more oil Co's to assume more responsibility on this matter. However, they're making billions so...
2080 2018-01-11 20:14:04 i got so many new art supplies including oil paints and i’m super excited to experiment :)

2094 2018-01-11 20:12:42 Can’t allow the beaches in Florida to be ruined incase of an oil spill. Everywhere else, they’re good to go.
2095 2018-01-11 20:12:37 You misunderstand. It’s a “Hey nice environment ya got there. Hate to see anything happen to it. Oops, sorry bout that oil spill. You shoulda MAGA’d.” thing.
2096 2018-01-11 20:12:34 The National Assembly declared on Tuesday that the Petro is illegal based on a prohibition by the constitution to use oil reserves as backup
2097 2018-01-11 20:12:23 I've been pointing this fallacy for ages.  "Foreign oil is pulling out of Alberta because of Notley!"  "But for each company outgoing, isn't someone else investing in the province by spending billions to buy those assets?"  "Quiet, dipper!"

2100 2018-01-11 20:11:58 Sorry, but there is one oil financed scientist who says he isn't an asshole, so i guess you are wrong, eh?
2101 2018-01-11 20:11:54 Come and have a look at the total shysters representing your precious Scottish Labour & I’ll show you a disgraced but still shameless lot of greedy, selfish crooks, intent on keeping their noses in the wealthy oil trough while people are begging in the streets.
2102 2018-01-11 20:11:52 @PressSec when asked about the situation regarding allowing Florida to be exempt from oil drilling, completely avoided answering the actual question. The person who asked should have responded, "I'm sorry that you didn't understand my question, but you didn't answer it."

2104 2018-01-11 20:11:41 Smashed an entire pizza drenched in olive oil and hot sauce after leg day for these gains
2105 2018-01-11 20:11:37 Oil will move someway so as you fight pipelines remember this can be the result
2106 2018-01-11 20:11:33 Yeap! Applesauce! Yeah they look pretty simple! Potatoes, onion, flour, egg & oil. You make them kinda like hash browns. I would still go with ketchup or syrup tho. Even the sour cream. Just not sure about the applesauce.

2111 2018-01-11 20:11:11 I completely agree with you sir.  Sessions HAS TO GO.  Mr.  President,  you WILL lose a lot of support if you allow Sessions to continue this path.  His priorities are completely wrong.  My son has epilepsy and cannabis oil helps with his seizures.  PLEASE FIRE SESSIONS!

Iono how true it is
But I'm shook...
I can't be surprise dou...I mean a country that refine its oil abroad then ship back
Smh
2116 2018-01-11 20:10:59 Interesting how Fla gets exemptions from off shore drilling..could the real reason perhaps be that Goc scott and Capt Twitty-it don’t want to see oil rigs off the shore near his crappy golf courses?!

2130 2018-01-11 20:10:03 Why should drilling only be off Texas, LA, MS and Alabama? An oil spill is a dreaded event anywhere but increase safety not access to true energy independence. The technology for renewables isn’t there yet.

2153 2018-01-11 20:07:32 I don't see any mention made of simple Scots exports like fish, cheese, beef, lamb, whiskey, gin all being in included as exports to England where they are then exported internationally. No mention in GERS? Is oil&processed fuel exports to UK in GERS?
2154 2018-01-11 20:07:25 Let’s begin by talking about the @SuaveBeauty Avocado and Olive Oil Body Wash and how its enriched with 100% natural Avocado and Olive Oil extracts that are known for being rich and conditioning for your skin! #SuaveBeliever
2155 2018-01-11 20:07:24 Utter tosh average wage in the UK his higher than Scotland,so your point is your being supported by the UK,your a idiot more so since oil prices tanked.

Still off topic,in or out of the UK your out of the EU.

2161 2018-01-11 20:06:54 Worth mentioning that Norway kept ownership of most of its oil & then taxed drillers to the max. Profits were held as reserves for public needs & retirement funds. US auctions off its resources and the super-profits go to Big Corps & Wall Street.

2164 2018-01-11 20:06:45 I did that but I also needed an oil change so I saved myself from that chunk of change
2165 2018-01-11 20:06:12 Absolutely NO talk about rule of law or ANYTHING going forward to prevent it again. 
Says DACA/Dems attitude is law doesn't matter
2166 2018-01-11 20:06:12 I'll complain and put off spending $50 on an oil change but will go drop $60 on weed like it's nothing. How NOT to adult. 
2167 2018-01-11 20:06:02 PSA: Not every container with a lid will successfully contain olive oil.

2169 2018-01-11 20:05:56 Waiting for my car’s oil to be changed and being entertained by @Unrefined_Ty’s compliment-giving twitter storm. 
2170 2018-01-11 20:05:48 maybe there is more oil in V and M?
2171 2018-01-11 20:05:33 I also argue popcorn with olive oil is basically a salad since corn is fibrous so maybe my logic might be a little too Reaganesque (though ketchup is def not a veggie or a fruit)
2172 2018-01-11 20:05:13 Oil and it's byproducts are in everything - make up, fleece, cell phones, etc. Like to see them give it all up and see how long they last!
2173 2018-01-11 20:05:12 Coconut oil?
2174 2018-01-11 20:05:10 @jkenney, I just got a price hike alert of $0.10/litre. Are you going to go shoot a video of you filling up your truck and protest the oil companies?
2175 2018-01-11 20:05:09 They are not starving!!  You just want yo cater to cattlemen & oil industry  that want to steal public lands.
2176 2018-01-11 20:04:59 Amazingly, you can still get Macassar oil. (Maybe that's really again rather than still.)
2177 2018-01-11 20:04:55 If it does you’ve got something other than CBD oil.
2178 2018-01-11 20:04:55 I’ve literally just washed and dried and my hair to then get lip oil in it fml
2179 2018-01-11 20:04:50 I try a new oil every time too.
2180 2018-01-11 20:04:47 How are you feeling about the off shore drilling? Or the elimination of the tax on oil companies to clean up spills (in that tax package you so glowingly endorsed).
2181 2018-01-11 20:04:45 Fun fact: Nearly half of the world’s active drilling rigs are in the U.S. and more than half of the nation’s #oil rigs are concentrated in West Texas’ #Permian Basin #OOTT #energy #Texas
2182 2018-01-11 20:04:32 When are you going to help Flint Mich. Their water is still poison. Also oil drill in Dakotas have failed. Your pipeline spill there huge
2183 2018-01-11 20:04:13 It'll be quite a while before countries/govts will reduce reliance on oil. It's energy dense, fairly easy to extract and no viable alternative - at the moment - despite positive progression on the renewable energy front

2187 2018-01-11 20:03:26 However, XLE you are more right than you are wrong :) It corrected similar to oil until Sept 2010 and then the pullbacks were practically impossible to trade until March 2011.
2188 2018-01-11 20:03:25 That moment when a Tory or kipper says Corbyn loves Iran and Venezuela but it's ok if we do business with Saudi Arabia because of oil. Because Iran and Venezuela doesn't have oil right? #Education is your friend

2200 2018-01-11 20:02:02 There needs to be something that promotes a whole food, plant based, no oil lifestyle.  There should be compliant foods in the cafe, displays on how big ag is polluting rivers, oceans & streams thru fertilizer & manure runoff, water reqmnts for animal feed & an organic garden.
2201 2018-01-11 20:01:59 Apologies in advance for the vape tweet, but I'm about to try CBD oil for the first time and I'm actually nervous. This shit isn't gonna get me high is it?

2213 2018-01-11 20:01:23 Pardon the pun, but we need a sea change. Fossil fuels belong in the ground. Western economies like the UK and US still depend far too heavily on oil production. Plastic comes from oil too, so let's reduce our dependence on the stuff.
2214 2018-01-11 20:01:19 We all know deep inside it’s US. It’s OUR addiction to driving everywhere. And that is not de Blasio’s fault. Hell, here in Los Angeles we can’t stop drilling for oil right next door to schools. But it’s up to our leaders to move us forward as a people. That is his failing.

2233 2018-01-11 19:59:41 Oh so many options.
Ditch Trident for a start.
Regain ALL our oil and gas revenues (yes that’s right - oil and gas again).
Expand our expertise in renewables.
Export electricity at a high price to our energy strapped neighbours south of the border.
I think we’ll be fine 
2234 2018-01-11 19:59:41 it's a different taste, the butter (any kind of fat or oil really) is just so the rice doesn't stick together you ideally shouldn't even notice it

2248 2018-01-11 19:57:18 With the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), big data & cloud deployment, IT and OT are now intertwined. You'll hear challenges Oil & Gas companies face when trying to manage data effectively, how to facilitate better cross company collaboration and break down these
2249 2018-01-11 19:57:06 I find it EXTREMELY CONFOUNDING, at best, that the struggling wage workers & rural citizens of this country can STILL put their faith in @realDonaldTrump, a self proclaimed “proponent for Big Oil & Gas” & a man who has perpetuated his fortune by screwing over the “little man.”

2252 2018-01-11 19:56:55 Loads of new oil coming on the market from Iraq, Iran, US fracking. Most of our oil comes from the US, goes to the US, which isn't OPEC. Doubt OPEC could have much effect against massive US fracking production. Why do you always need someone to blame for every problem?

2259 2018-01-11 19:55:57 Nope. Exxon will not willingly stop drilling for oil. Ever. This isn't about making Exxon change. This is about making it harder for them to drill, to make money off drilling and to reduce the political influence of an industry hellbent on climate destruction. 1/

2305 2018-01-11 19:50:40 I’ve noticed that there are no oil companies left in the world. Except for in the US, Middle East, and Europe. But that’s it. Our woes certainly can’t be due to failed economic policy from our two govts.

2312 2018-01-11 19:49:53 I forgot that I've only had my car for like 4 months, so neither me or my dad have changed the oil in it before. He can't find the filter and I'm inside crippled and can't help him 
2313 2018-01-11 19:49:43 Try Benefit! I have extremely oily skin and I have definitely noticed a difference since I started using it! Sometimes it's not the foundation it's the prep you do beforehand  I also highly recommend Liz Earle's gentle exfoliator for reducing oil  xxx
2314 2018-01-11 19:49:38 Every Governor should insert their state & name to this letter. No state is better than the other! No state wants oil rigs or pipelines.

2321 2018-01-11 19:48:57 @DaveHcontrarian WTI oil continuing to creep up, now $64. Any changes to your view that top is right around here? I tend to agree with your call though wonder whether this typical late-cycle commodities blow-off might extend more due to hot money chasing it (like early 2008).
2322 2018-01-11 19:48:54 Seriously? You don't commute or travel? You grow all your food in your backyard? Wasn't your computer / smart phone made in China with coal energy and transported half way around the world with oil.
What about electricity?

2324 2018-01-11 19:48:50 Fuel Oil: ICE plans to transfer trading in hundreds of energy futures contracts from London to the US, as customers seek to escape Mifid II. By Feb 19, 245 futures and options contracts on NAm oil and gas will be removed from ICE Futures Europe.
2325 2018-01-11 19:48:41 These things contribute, but no one causes more destruction than Big Oil, now unregulated by an ignorant administration. There’s a spill bigger than Exxon V about to blow up in the S China Sea. Lack of regs will cause a horrible disaster that affects our environment as a whole.

2456 2018-01-11 19:35:59 Sure, cause that has nothing to do with the fact our oil is more difficult and costly to get from the oilsands vs their easily accessible, cheap drilling oil. Or that they have built in infrastructure for refining. Sure.

2465 2018-01-11 19:34:48 When will State Legislatures, Congress fine oil, coal companies trillions of dollars for increasing Medicaid, Medicare costs?  Air pollution increases health care costs children with asthma, people with heart, lung?
2466 2018-01-11 19:34:39 Try the aztec healing clay on those parts of your body but consistently. And after you’re done apply shea butter and vitamin e oil.
2467 2018-01-11 19:34:39 Yeah, who needs oil!
2468 2018-01-11 19:34:33 Blue Sky mine - midnight oil
2469 2018-01-11 19:34:24 It’s Vallejo Gunmetal, shaded Nuln Oil twice, Typhus Corrosion, Ryza Rust and then sponged Vallejo Metal to get the metallic look back :)
2470 2018-01-11 19:34:23 If it were true what has Russia received? We are pumping oil hurting overall world market price Russias #1 export. We're reducing regulations so we can pump more in future-We plan on rebuilding our military-They cant afford to keep up-But last admin sold 20% of our uranium.
2471 2018-01-11 19:34:21 a good day to finally get my oil changed & deep clean my car & house. 
2472 2018-01-11 19:34:15 I think Mr. Craig missed at least 1 (one) major oil price recession. Not 100% sure, just kinda have that feeling. #ableg
2473 2018-01-11 19:34:11 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump watching Fox news one segment was to expect higher oil rates because of Iran sanctions!!???  And now Mnuchin is telling us we are going to be getting more money in our paycheck.  They will cancel each other out!  Gaaaaaaa
2474 2018-01-11 19:34:09 We are going to need it as fast as gas prices are rising! Oil over 70 dollars a barrel and heading toward 100 dollars a barrel! Heating oil prices are up almost 40% over last year. We never get ahead!
2475 2018-01-11 19:34:01 Yeah I can't believe crude oil is above 60 now
2476 2018-01-11 19:33:56 Well oil took a little dive there..

2479 2018-01-11 19:33:31 I feel this so hard  swear I'm on jar 2 of coconut oil already
2480 2018-01-11 19:33:24 Oil might start it all

2483 2018-01-11 19:32:55 @platinum_oil thanks for following
2484 2018-01-11 19:32:50 Oil, Wipe It Up Before the Cardinal of T
Rudolf Schwarzkogler, Ludwig Kirchner
Jute, Lurex, linen, plastic-polymer paint on canvas
2485 2018-01-11 19:32:47 If not more! Look at all the oil that was confiscated, offshore Crimea and Sea of Azov!
2486 2018-01-11 19:32:43 Some experts claim existence of more sink holes and earthquake/tremor activity in areas where oil drilling is permitted. Trump truly does not keep abreast of important conservation information and impact results. No more oil drilling needed near our shores. He doesn't care.
2487 2018-01-11 19:32:30 Well oil tycoons are going to suffer because sales are going to fall for 2018.
2488 2018-01-11 19:32:28 It'll be just the pink and blue hues in the puffy clouds like some sort of oil painting
2489 2018-01-11 19:32:25 Never was a real democracy so like most of these oil states is run by criminals who grab power with some mil. support. European colonials should have held on to these states. But no the world moves on.
2490 2018-01-11 19:32:22 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
2491 2018-01-11 19:32:17 No where should be drilled. Solar and wind have both been cheaper than oil for a while now.
2492 2018-01-11 19:32:12 PSA to all essential oil users: please make sure that the oils you’re using/diffusing are nontoxic to your pets, especially cats!! their skin is more delicate than ours and they absorb oils faster than they can metabolize out of their system!!

2495 2018-01-11 19:31:55 She's a serial liar. If you paid her enough she'd say motor oil tastes like chocolate.
2496 2018-01-11 19:31:51 Hiya can you please explain why these sausages have palm oil in them and your rosemary ones do not? They are so similar. Why can you not cut it out? Also is the palm oil sustainable? It does not state that it is.
2497 2018-01-11 19:31:44 All I’m sayin is... I better not have ANY wrinkles when I’m old with all this damn oil on my face 
2498 2018-01-11 19:31:31 @realDonaldTrump We get tax cuts and then you guys drive oil prices up...WE CANT CATCH A BREAK..GOD I HATE GOVERNMENT
2499 2018-01-11 19:31:22 I rarely use face makeup and my face still acts up and breaks out. Sometimes it’s not about whether you “cake your face” or not. It’s just how your skin reacts. It’s natural. Some people produce more oil than others which causes acne.

2502 2018-01-11 19:31:07 Alaskans own 59,200 shares of FALCON ENERGY GROUP LTD, worth $5,381. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in SINGAPORE.
2503 2018-01-11 19:30:56 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump   it used to be you could not speculate on OIL , if this factor was taken away we can keep prices down we don’t need high oil prices
2504 2018-01-11 19:30:53 Looks good. Better alignment with the Financial Provisioning Regulations. But the tax penalties are still confined to only the mining/oil&gas sector...
2505 2018-01-11 19:30:53 I can hardly wait for my larger paycheck and lower electric bill...or will all the savings be taken away by big Oil and big Pharma...
2506 2018-01-11 19:30:41 Where do I say I want them discarded? I think it's beautiful having a terrorist sponsoring oil state taking over football & treating it as a personal play thing! PSG not same ambition??. 2 world record transfer fees 6 mths ago & they no ambition
2507 2018-01-11 19:30:41 Don't let big oil take the th r tax rebates@realDonaldTrump
2508 2018-01-11 19:30:37 @realDonaldTrump if oil prices wipe out pay increases you are doomed !!!!!!!
2509 2018-01-11 19:30:30 #C4News "Why 25 years?" Because that's how long it will take to placate and pay off the oil lobby, who will lose plastic sales alongside losing petrol/diesel sales.
2510 2018-01-11 19:30:23 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.

2512 2018-01-11 19:30:07 Wow look at oil now!
2513 2018-01-11 19:30:01 The wording here is a little odd.  There are bargains in the natural gas & oil stocks but they are trading at lofty valuations?  Puzzled.  Would you mind rewording and reposting?  Would be helpful.
2514 2018-01-11 19:29:53 A table spoon and a half of the oil they drink orange juice to wash it down . Castor oil taste terrible though
2515 2018-01-11 19:29:53 X: Recommendations on strategy books?
Me: I get asked this a lot. Outside the military world, the last good book on business strategy was Sun Tzu, Art of War. Since then, most lack any context and can be described as little more than outcome bias or magic thinking or snake oil.
2516 2018-01-11 19:29:40 An oil and gas deal went south for him, that was the beginning...
The prayer is that he gets his rehabilitated and fast too
2517 2018-01-11 19:29:28 How does offshore oil drilling adversely affect tourism?
2518 2018-01-11 19:29:22 When was the last time we put the news on and the headline was 'We didn't have the money to bomb a country'? WE HAD A CRISIS because Britain wanted to nick a country's oil but we had ran out of money? WHEN?
2519 2018-01-11 19:29:20 Are you supposed to tip the service guy who changes the oil?
2520 2018-01-11 19:29:19 do they miss the irony that plastic is largely a crude oil bi-product?
2521 2018-01-11 19:29:15 Oil changed , car washed thank God 
2522 2018-01-11 19:29:12 @realDonaldTrump High oil prices benefit Venezuela, Iran, Russia to fund terrorism around the world & suppress dissent within.
2523 2018-01-11 19:29:05 Thank you for standing up for NC coast!! Frightening to think of drilling consequences after tax bill took away 9cent tax per barrel that oil companies paid for emergency oil clean-up fund!! #NoCoastalDrilling
2524 2018-01-11 19:29:00 Hounds need more fat in their diet comapred to orher dogs due to their natural low body fat. Adding a tablespoon or two of salmon oil or goose fat to each meal helps a lot! Look for salmon oil for horses, quite cheap and goes a long way
2525 2018-01-11 19:28:52 If you have a D by your name, you're probably going to get more oil rigs than your coast can handle.  The GOP is vindictive
2526 2018-01-11 19:28:52 Thanks President Trump
Wall Street hits record as oil, industrial stocks gain Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was up 119.54 points, or 0.47  percent, at 25,488.67 and the S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 10.06  points, or 0.37 percent, at 2,758.29.
2527 2018-01-11 19:28:39 Multi-state slow travel is very easy, I do it all the time with train or car (increasingly easy with EVs, I also travel on veggie oil, but don't recommend it as it's an intense hobby). Train system sucks right now but huge potential for rapid improvement. Get creative!
2528 2018-01-11 19:28:31 Dayum!!!
@POTUS gives us #TaxCuts and now gas price gouging is taking it away.
I'll be very happy when we start drilling off our own shores and the gas companies will no longer be able to hold us hostage with excuses of not having enough oil.
#LowerGasPricesNow
2529 2018-01-11 19:28:20 The Market Close - Oil briefly hits $70 a barrel for first time in three years

2534 2018-01-11 19:27:58 oil is falling as we speak
2535 2018-01-11 19:27:57 Even the best swords need a good oil to perform at the highest level! Beards deserve a good oil too! #oilthatbeard
2536 2018-01-11 19:27:51 Which specifically?

The mask is at clicks.
Coconut oil at dischem.
2537 2018-01-11 19:27:49 There is a girl in my class who just used some essential oil and SIS I AM NOW THRIVING WOW!!! What is this witchcraft.
2538 2018-01-11 19:27:44 Haven’t spent money on my car unless it was necessary like an oil change the whole time Ive had it 
2539 2018-01-11 19:27:42 Retiring, afraid of the wave...why don't U not be evil instead? Milleniels want clean oceans, not oil rigs across both coast,  FAIR tax plan
2540 2018-01-11 19:27:37 look at oil... she was on a LEDGE consolidating also! $CL
2541 2018-01-11 19:27:33 I have 3 1.2 MW generators for sale   They are old Fairbanks Morse gen sets. Natural gas/ fuel oil or combination. Had been last used for standby power. Let me know if there is any interest.
2542 2018-01-11 19:27:32 IM online!! High tip today gets cookies! lets get to this oil show countdown!!
2543 2018-01-11 19:27:31 I just pledged $20/month for @dearestscooter #podcast. It is perhaps the only podcast or service for that matter that genuinely helps me solve a big problem and helps me lead a healthier, happier life without preaching/selling snake oil/"tips and tricks"
2544 2018-01-11 19:27:30 Vern Buchanan a water and oil separator Plus a respirator would have prevented a lifetime of suffering for me & a few other gentleman that worked for you yet your greed kept that from happing and it still keeps you from doing the right thing the toxic landfill is still there.
2545 2018-01-11 19:27:29 A5 I would rub oil on my baby and just give massages on tummy, sometimes changing the formula helped  #MembersMarkMoments

2547 2018-01-11 19:27:15 smuggle coconut oil and send it to me no one has to knwo 
2548 2018-01-11 19:27:14 Erm, the Scottish govt doesn't have "control" of North Sea Oil revenue. It all goes to London and we've all seen how they managed to squander it over a period of 40 years.
2549 2018-01-11 19:27:13 Oil price hike is strictly only for Russian Election. No one else are allowed to profit from it.
2550 2018-01-11 19:27:07 OUR PRESIDENT THE HERDSMAN!
His post-retirement after PTF assignment: 
No book was written
No major speech was given on anything
No vision was ever expounded 
No tangible investments 
Nothing on education
Nothing on health
Nothing on the oil sector 
Nothing on youth development

2555 2018-01-11 19:26:27 What coconut oil u using sis ?
2556 2018-01-11 19:26:26 Also, fyi, coconut oil is one the worst foods health-wise. You're better off using bacon fat than coconut oil in your cooking.
2557 2018-01-11 19:26:21 If you work in the oil and gas industry, stainless steel #nameplates are the perfect choice to withstand the harsh environment.
2558 2018-01-11 19:26:07 weeeeeee .. just heard oil prices at a 3 year high. dollars to donuts, that extra will be added to our petrol prices very quickly. Can't remember when Auckland get hits by the 10c levy (11.5c)
2559 2018-01-11 19:25:54 I never really liked Triscuits until I tried the Cracked Pepper and Olive Oil. Now they're my favorite.
2560 2018-01-11 19:25:54 Pacing clinics are equivalent to any other snake oil remedy available. The true patients wouldnt be able to show up anyway!

2566 2018-01-11 19:25:36 I have a cleaning face brush i got I.T for like 15 dollars at Walmart. I use I.T every other day at the end of the day. I would also only use your oil every few or every other day. I only use tea tree when my face is really dry.
2567 2018-01-11 19:25:30 Which power are you talking about is it 5 hrs a day.  Increase in foreign reserve can only be credited to increase in price of crude oil.  You might not have option but we have options.  Again Buhari is a FAILURE.

2571 2018-01-11 19:24:27 More info please on the divestment of oil and gas from the portfolios of NY State Retirement system.  Also, presuming it will be invested in wind and solar, recommendations???
2572 2018-01-11 19:24:24 @realDonaldTrump Oil prices are skyrocketing & will impact economy. Why did Zenke surrender to Florida & withdraw offshore drilling in Florida ?. Now all other states are demanding same. We need cheap abundant oil.
2573 2018-01-11 19:24:21 We need Ottawa to stand up for our oil and gas industry. Stop buying from foreign countries when you let your own people suffer.
2574 2018-01-11 19:24:18 Good question.  @GovernorKayIvey aren’t we on the list?  Mobile Bay is still suffering from the last oil spill (which also damaged Orange Beach and Gulf Shores).
2575 2018-01-11 19:24:06 There is only one substance shown to have efficacy in supplement form. Many foods have been shown to have benefits but only fish oil has efficacy in pill form.

2579 2018-01-11 19:23:42 @greenpeaceusa R u planning to call on kayactivists now tht @realDonaldTrump wants to re-open our oceans for oil drilling?
2580 2018-01-11 19:23:39 Agree. If/when oil pulls back there will be better pitches to swing at. Couldn't get myself to purchase oil related equities $20 ago because the charts didn't show outperformance on it's price relative to spy. I don't make predictions.
2581 2018-01-11 19:23:37 @SheaMoisture the glass bottles are pitifully small. I can get a huge bottle of mango Jamaican and lime castor oil in a ton of flavors for $6.99 @ sally beauty vs.  the tiny bottle you sell for $9.99. Come on now. These little sample size oils and serums you sell are inadequate.
2582 2018-01-11 19:23:34 I do not know which to prefer: $TBT or straight $OIL...
2583 2018-01-11 19:23:30 $70 a barrel of oil....what a great time to get 1000s out of the ground each day. Come on #UKOG! Let’s see the money. Can’t say we haven’t been patient now.

2586 2018-01-11 19:23:28 Divest away, but invest more in renewables - cost and convenience will hammer oil
2587 2018-01-11 19:23:27 3/ Think 2018 might be year of commodity comeback.  $GLD $SLV Natgas and $oil all inflating, thus finally causing inflation in consumer products.  Thus, gold.
2588 2018-01-11 19:23:27 the answer is the money, The other side of this war are the kochs and the mercers who control the money, if you attack the oil, you attack them. When you attack their bank balance. be warned
2589 2018-01-11 19:23:26 I’ve been using African Shea Butter and Tea Tree Oil but I think it’s clogging up my pores
2590 2018-01-11 19:23:26 The nuclear crisis was wrought by your hero and demigod, Obama by allowing an oil rich nation to pursue "nuclear energy" and thinking the public was too dumb to see the betrayal to our nation's security.
2591 2018-01-11 19:23:24 That wall will become Americas greatest tourist attraction. Bigger than the now smaller national monuments and parks.  Your so smart. Good thinking. Will it have viewing platforms and places where good Americans can tip hot oil onto the masses on the the Mexican side.
2592 2018-01-11 19:23:10 When are state legislatures, Congress going to fine oil, coal companies trillions of dollars for increasing Medicaid, Medicare costs?  Air pollution increases health care costs children with asthma, people with heart/lung problems, etc

2603 2018-01-11 19:22:21 That's a terrible burden on Scotland thank goodness we have the UK Broad shoulders to look after it for us "ohh I really meant squander Scotland's resources that could have created an oil fund of £1tn like Norway rather than a £1.9tn debt & rising in UK #WhereHasScotlandsCashGone
2604 2018-01-11 19:22:18 A friend was admitted in hospital for depression. Oil deal with Nigerians went wrong. Vessel only arrived in SA with water only! Everything seems legit

2607 2018-01-11 19:22:04 You know the US is an oil exporter now? Also the only country in the world that has a major party that denies climate science. Glass houses and whatnot
2608 2018-01-11 19:21:32 Getting oysters on the side of the street... I miss this living in NY... trying to ignore olive oil sellers blatantly bragging about violating customs XD
2609 2018-01-11 19:21:30 #C4News When was the last time we put the news on and the headline was 'We didn't have the money to bomb a country'? WE HAD A CRISIS because Britain wanted to nick a country's oil but we had ran out of money? WHEN?
2610 2018-01-11 19:21:23 OK, spell this out for me. A relatively small number of highly-influential investors divest from fossil fuel stocks. Then what? How does the world improve as a result? Does ExxonMobil stop drilling for oil, just to get those investors back?

2613 2018-01-11 19:20:53 Skin's breaking out because it's too oily. Using some tea tree oil and facewash to counter it.
2614 2018-01-11 19:20:51 Oil drills everywhere except when it spoils the view in front of Trump’s Florida golf course? OMFG
2615 2018-01-11 19:20:42 Kshitij, @shashiasha & I agree most of the times on the economic issues and how Modi Govt has bungled on that front but on Oil pricing, I have a different take..
2616 2018-01-11 19:20:41 $FCX at oil crisis lows had 20B in debt. CEO said going to cut debt in half. Guess what - debt is 10B and apparently going lower. 
Talk of dividend coming back. 
@Carl_C_Icahn killing it again.. did he buy single digits?

2619 2018-01-11 19:20:17 I got my oil changed in my truck plus got my room clean. Now time to clean the studio, then do my homework.
2620 2018-01-11 19:20:13 Phinney's fat recommendations for keto are based on mimicking the composition of depot fat; that's 2:1 MUFA/SFA ratio and (conservatively) around 9% PUFA, though he more specifically recommended butter-olive oil blend that gives 5% PUFA
2621 2018-01-11 19:20:12 For this I cut potatoes in wedges add a bit of turmeric,salt and pepper,chickpeas with paprika and drizzled with a bit of olive oil and roasted in the oven, the asparagus are just grilled and the spinach are sautéed with olive oil and garlic and then add the beanshope it helps
2622 2018-01-11 19:20:11 I have 3 1.2 MW generators for sale   They are old Fairbanks Morse gen sets. Natural gas/ fuel oil or combination. Had been last used for standby power. Let me know if there is any interest.
2623 2018-01-11 19:20:09 We, the citizens of the US, are not tin soldiers or pawns to be played on a board.  Ask the citizens before you set up various oil drills, prison reforms, etc.  Which means, private sector needs to take a step back and allow the states to legislate what is needed in their states.
2624 2018-01-11 19:20:05 Many don't even call for 2 cloves. " 1) Crush clove and sautee in olive oil.  2) Discard remainder.  3) Remove crushed clove from olive oil and discard that too.  4) Discard olive oil and rinse pan.  "That's all the garlic you need."
2625 2018-01-11 19:19:59 We should all see therapists as frequent as changing motor oil. It's good to readjust your mind and emotions every now and then

2628 2018-01-11 19:19:27 I dropped my car off SIX HOURS ago to get an oil change, and it’s still not done. I think they stole my car.
2629 2018-01-11 19:19:21 When you go to a new oil change spot they try to get you on everything 
2630 2018-01-11 19:19:19 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
2631 2018-01-11 19:19:12 Oil just hit $70/barrel. Expect an explosion in #shale drilling (at $70 almost every shale play in the US is economically viable).

2635 2018-01-11 19:18:51 So that means I can’t rub her down in oil though ?
2636 2018-01-11 19:18:42 would you like to intern in the world's leading internationally traded Oil and Gas Company, are you proficient in your Can-Do spirit, are you willing to learn with intent.... (1/2)
2637 2018-01-11 19:18:31 Good 
2638 2018-01-11 19:18:20 "Ollie you are really too sweet." She says softly looking at him. "I'll make sure Clark has a complete - oil overhaul or something when everything is done."
2639 2018-01-11 19:18:12 The power of social media! @PetroHome got us a technician and oil today. Two days of no heat. I expect this won’t happen again.
2640 2018-01-11 19:18:01 Tennesseean here! Our Governor is rich...PILOT OIL RICH. I wonder what he has to say about this? 
2641 2018-01-11 19:17:58 Haha all the money is in denying it (coal and oil billionaires). Kinda like the cancer from cigarettes thing... scientists tell us the truth then huge lobby groups deny it. You’re falling for the rich companies bullshit lie so they can make money.
2642 2018-01-11 19:17:57 May I suggest olive oil.
2643 2018-01-11 19:17:55 Just go to Wendy’s first, cause oil changes take forever lol prioritize
2644 2018-01-11 19:17:55 Seismic testing was part of the package along with oil and gas drilling. Has Florida been exempted from seismic testing?
2645 2018-01-11 19:17:53 It depends on my skin that day. I either use actual tea tree oil or clean and clear morning burst.

2648 2018-01-11 19:17:03 England's biggest export to Nigeria is refined petrol and diesel,much of it is originally from Nigerian crude oil.
2649 2018-01-11 19:16:49 I can’t rub my shorty down in oil ?
2650 2018-01-11 19:16:48 Boycot Pilot oil from now on. All over 77/ I-81 corridor.

2652 2018-01-11 19:16:43 USA needs more capital formation.  Estate taxes decrease capital formation, punish people for working hard.  USA needs to reduce trillions in welfare to corporate welfare queens - banks, oil, coal, cable, prescription drugs, etc.  IMF Externalities on net
2653 2018-01-11 19:16:28 Because I tend to be skeptical when ever I hear of miracle cancer treatments that somehow have not made their way into regular usage despite their clear merit. 9/10 it's snake oil.
2654 2018-01-11 19:16:27 Oil level sight banjos, grease nipples, fork bush grub screws, Jawa rocker cover nuts, etc
2655 2018-01-11 19:16:26 Okay, do a hot oil treatment after washing your hair and leave it in. It nourishes your roots and helps hair grow. Do it with a mixture of oils (coconut, olive, castor, rosemary) for best results
2656 2018-01-11 19:16:12 Energy independence for the USA - aka: not being dependent on enemies for our energy - is far more important than eliminating every minuscule risk of an off-shore oil spill (which rarely happens and is easily cleaned up when it does).  Dems keep promoting fear through lies.
2657 2018-01-11 19:15:51 For some reasons all of a sudden we have more than 3-5 sectors fighting for one thing or another at a time,if it’s not teachers,it’s oil marketers,it’s Fulani herdsmen,it’s ASUU,it’s doctors,it’s pensioners...no fucking peace of mind.
2658 2018-01-11 19:15:46 Also an uptrend in oil price since June 2017.

2664 2018-01-11 19:15:18 It's sad that Everything we are experiencing today, was written about thousands of years ago. GOD WARNED US THAT THE FINAL WARS WILL BE.  ALL ABOUT THE OIL AND ARMS SUPPLIES.

2666 2018-01-11 19:15:09 Oriana Fallaci, in her book 'The Force of Reason', described how in the mid 1960's, Gaddafi & Boumediene sold the idea to Europe of a sure oil supply,and in return, Europe would accept Arab 'workers'. The rest is history

2671 2018-01-11 19:14:19 HUMOUR:
One of the first things you learn about taking care of a car in Nigeria is the importance of quickly rubbing brake oil on a body scratch.
2672 2018-01-11 19:14:05 Tablespoon of oil, heat, tablespoon of Thai curry paste, heat. Add chicken, 5minutes. A can of coconut milk- let thicken. Add sugarsnaps and baby corn. 3 minutes. Dinner in 15. (Use microwave rice- ain’t nobody got time to do that properly!)
2673 2018-01-11 19:13:59 Deadlines are important.. It ensures that the work will be done by hook or crook in that stipulated time. Whether you burn the midnight oil or you time it right.. That's your call! But do set up a deadline.. It always helps! #storyofmylife
2674 2018-01-11 19:13:56 US doesn't buy your oil o. Same way they stopped is the same way demand will fall when fuel powered cars are phased out. Then what happens? Dollar shortages, panic, recession, blah blah blah
My point: let us stop the rejoicing and get to work.
2675 2018-01-11 19:13:54 I'm sure there are people out there who hate water colors, but out of all the kinds of paints I've used, water colors have given me the best results. And you can use them with almost any other media! (Colored pencils, markers, oil pastels, other paints, etc.)
2676 2018-01-11 19:13:50 I deleted my reply because I realized literally any organic material could turn into oil over millions of years, not just dinos....still not sure if thats true, but it sounds smarter than my last reply so throw me a.....bone *laugh track*
2677 2018-01-11 19:13:48 WHAT? You mean their theories of "melting ice" raises sea levels, @algore's "Trading my voodoo science for your $'s will stop climate from changing, and replacing offshore oil production with solar panels and wind turbines will help gummer snails flourish were all wrong?
2678 2018-01-11 19:13:46 let's set up oil rig platforms off Trump's properties and then we'll talk about the rest of the coastline
2679 2018-01-11 19:13:40 Feel better! I been dodging that so far this year. It hangs on for a couple months & is so exhausting.  If you can, get some Peppermint oil, Eucalyptus oil & Spearmint oil online, add to pot of hot boiling h2o, tent your head w towel over pot, breath steam. Also good to sip on.
2680 2018-01-11 19:13:36 Well is anyone noticing that oil is at 63 dollars a barrel or does anyone care thats the things that continues to go up is cost of fuel HELLO MR PRESIDENT are you paying attention

2685 2018-01-11 19:13:19 Check if your sump has a dent in it.  If it has a bit of oil can leak out the sump gasket. Its a tray right at the bottom of the engine and you will have to slide under the car for a good look.  Google it.  Sump cover.
2686 2018-01-11 19:13:10 Check your Engine oil this morning.

2699 2018-01-11 19:12:14 Can say the same about WRC when that has been spec fuel for years (I used to supply it) branding was mainly lubes based or around "relationships" between manufacture and oil major
2700 2018-01-11 19:12:07 @GordonRamsay Can I use a meat thermometer to measure oil temperature when frying? Thanks for your expertise! 
2701 2018-01-11 19:12:07 I want oil to make sense, lol. I'm seeing the Brent 70 loons out and about. I can't wait until their party crashes. No shortage of oil in the world, yet it keeps getting bid up. PR tactics work wonders unfortunately :)
2702 2018-01-11 19:12:02 "If we give these oil companies these tax credits, the pipeline will fill back up and they will provide a massive amount of new jobs..."

Around 5000 job losses.

Pretty significant implications #akleg 
Enough is enough. Do your job.

2707 2018-01-11 19:11:46 What’s a good foundation that’s oil free, hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and all of that good stuff that lasts for most of the day and doesn’t separate and shit
2708 2018-01-11 19:11:37 Good list but Provorov has been far better than Gostisbehere and one could argue Carlson has been the biggest snub of all. He's been a horse for the Caps.

2724 2018-01-11 19:10:06 Yup. Been there done that (took the kids to Oil Kings game b/c what's the diff to them)
2725 2018-01-11 19:10:01 OIL DIFF: 5.53 -> 5.64
2726 2018-01-11 19:09:56 Notable in #markets today is what is/isn't happening. 
On the former: records for #stocks , higher #oil & stronger Euro.
On the latter: failure of US government bond yields to move higher after yesterday's scare.(10-year is 2 basis points lower at 2.53%,where it was two days ago)
2727 2018-01-11 19:09:50 NO SHIT!! Guess Orange Man doesn’t want to look at those Oil rigs from his “Club House”.
2728 2018-01-11 19:09:33 I’ve been reading about oil pulling but can you share more about your experience?
2729 2018-01-11 19:09:14 i want to drown myself in rose water, tea tree oil, and sea salt spray
2730 2018-01-11 19:09:01 Coconut oil does wonders
2731 2018-01-11 19:08:54 ...partly because Alberta oil sands producers want to sell crude oil into Asian markets that are in the process of implementing carbon pricing (cf. China). Driving down the carbon-intensity of AB heavy crude makes AB producers more competitive in those markets.
2732 2018-01-11 19:08:45 Oil rigs in the future. How about solar panels?

2737 2018-01-11 19:08:13 oil is bullish again ...sdrl?
2738 2018-01-11 19:08:08 Did you spill motor oil in my closet? DAMNIT.
2739 2018-01-11 19:08:03 That's what I do! Any kind of oil, really.
2740 2018-01-11 19:08:02 Trump plan for offshore drilling will destroy NC revenue of 3 billion that NC makes off tourism. Florida is exempt? Glad to see northern Republican Governors against Trump administration to destroy our coasts for big oil.
2741 2018-01-11 19:07:57 Saudi has a huge trade surplus from it's oil. Get back to me on that one when its run out.  I agree that deregulation was the massive driving force behind the crash, but that was all started by Thatcher,blair continued it (along with privatisation) hence he is known as a red tory
2742 2018-01-11 19:07:48 Maybe they don’t use oil in beach states...so they don’t want drillling
2743 2018-01-11 19:07:37 So, couple of YEARS ago Sechin gave interview to FT stating this; Agreement has since expanded to RU-Saudi-China & Exxon
Control of global oil market
Rosneft-Exxon on all 7 continents

2744 2018-01-11 19:07:34 @tradeaholic Without your confidence in oil I wouldnt be were I am now!!! Seriously, up almost 100% since mid december. Thanks. Keep up the good and inspiring work. We have to work on that "30" project. If I find some time the next few weeks I will look into it in more detail.
2745 2018-01-11 19:07:27 You're measuring oil in cubic miles?!?
2746 2018-01-11 19:07:26 So a little boost of confidence I go to hank graff to get my oil change and the dudes working on my car keep talking about how clean and nice my car is 
2747 2018-01-11 19:07:16 Toenails suck. They're literally the human body's oil change. Routine maintenance. Plus, you can stub 'em!
2748 2018-01-11 19:07:14 i wash my hair with kukui nut oil shampoo
2749 2018-01-11 19:07:13 #M25 anti-clockwise between J6 and J5. Traffic has been released. We've been unable to clear the outside lane so the vehicles are remaining there for now. There's also a large oil spillage in the road to clear. Lane 4 (of 4) closed.
2750 2018-01-11 19:07:09 My edges did not survive them lemonade braids over the summer. My beautician cussed me out so bad. Went coconut, jamaican castor and Taliah oil crazy. We back now, ya bish

2752 2018-01-11 19:07:01 “Our real oil is cocoa,” said Silva, owner of the chocolatier Kirikire that in 2014 won an award from the prestigious Salon du Chocolat fair in Paris. “In Europe, they’re snatching up these bars.”
2753 2018-01-11 19:06:57 Thanks Yan for booking a Oil And Filter Change with #Fiix for your Mercedes-Benz!  #Richmond Hill #Toronto #Tech
2754 2018-01-11 19:06:56 Less genocide more, leave the Native American population alone, let the Parks Departments/Tribe manage the land. Everyone else from oil workers, ranchers, and diamond miners...fuck em.
2755 2018-01-11 19:06:46 Arsene will be pleased if they do go a season unbeaten.  Doesn’t count as it’s oil money!
2756 2018-01-11 19:06:45 My hair only likes water and oil 
2757 2018-01-11 19:06:38 And maybe the oil drillers in your state will vote u the fck out of office too !!
2758 2018-01-11 19:06:35 This lavender oil in my necklace has  got me feeling wooooosah
2759 2018-01-11 19:06:32 @Josh_Ward  I'm with you. Argon Oil makes your hair feel great, and no more dandruff
2760 2018-01-11 19:06:27 Those Appalachian residents who thought Trump was going to help you, I feel sorry for you incredible suckers. HE JUST WANTED YOUR VOTE. You will end up without health care and NO VISION FOR THE FUTURE. Oh, and he will accelerate coal's decline through more oil production.
2761 2018-01-11 19:06:19 Hate the wait when I get a oil change...
2762 2018-01-11 19:06:08 There is a substance which I believe is based on orange oil, called "sticky stuff remover" - honestly - that seems pretty good.
2763 2018-01-11 19:06:08 Wait until oil starts trading in Yuan?
2764 2018-01-11 19:05:58 More like it's an open field with oil derricks on one side and the other is semi urban if you look at maps SDF secured the desert and then secured the river villages.
2765 2018-01-11 19:05:50 City crowned champions "doesn't count its oil money"
2766 2018-01-11 19:05:48 Colleague just said he had legacy pension fund from prev employment that was heading rapidly down in value. Guess what fund was largely invested in...oil & gas. Might wanna check what future your #pension is investing in  #Divest
2767 2018-01-11 19:05:43 The only solution....body oil and nudity. Then we can truly mimic the sardines they make of us.

2769 2018-01-11 19:05:29 @ProfOsinbajo @MBuhari The oil companies in Nigeria want to increase their share of the oil they drill and the telecommunication companies want to increase the cost of services.
2770 2018-01-11 19:05:07 Tea tree oil! Clean it like you just got it done again too about 3-5 times a day
2771 2018-01-11 19:05:01 IF YOU HAVE YOUR ANOINTING OIL THERE, DROP SOME IN YOUR PALMS & RUB THEM TOGETHER AND PRAY THIS.WITCHCRAFT CHAIN IN MY HANDS BREAK
2772 2018-01-11 19:05:00 I bet when they smashed you in the derby they were all gutted about the oil based money.
2773 2018-01-11 19:04:50 Well oil be buggered
2774 2018-01-11 19:04:46 อหหหหหห เพื่อนโทรมาหากูหลับนี่กูเป็นคนเดียวไม่รู้สึกถึงแผ่นดินไหวหลับตาย
2775 2018-01-11 19:04:44 Bet all the city fans are gutted about the fact it’s oil-based money.  As they’re sat there watching attacking, ruthless football, it will be crushing them that it’s ‘oil money’....

2778 2018-01-11 19:04:29 Interesting so Trump can stop an oil company drilling in Florida cause it might affect his beachside property but he won't prevent drilling in #arctic.  Wow he really is protecting his financial investment.
2779 2018-01-11 19:04:28 What drives oil price today is demand and supply, oil price will remain sweet due to demand from India,china, US & developing world, the EU is making progress in e-c but what's their total consumption compared to them
2780 2018-01-11 19:04:26 @Albitamix any views on oil?
2781 2018-01-11 19:04:22 Mason Zeigler has announced he will be on the Lucas Oil Tour this year.
2782 2018-01-11 19:04:13 ‘Aberdeen about to lose thousands of jobs’ hang on ‘oil price at highest level for years’.
2783 2018-01-11 19:04:01 @Thom_Hartmann The US threat to Iran and, therefore, China's oil has been answered by China's threat to dump US bonds.  It's asymmetrical warfare.

2785 2018-01-11 19:03:49 Democrat @JayInslee mulling ways to capture Trump administration’s attention so they’ll treat his state like Florida and rule out oil and gas drilling off the coast: Maybe we need to buy Trump a golf course in Washington state, he jokes.

2788 2018-01-11 19:03:29 Listen my day went from let me wake up and get a oil change to fuck everybody in .2 secs
2789 2018-01-11 19:03:26 It wasn't an apple in The Garden of Eden; it was oil! Joking aside, how many international crimes have been committed/wars started because of oil?
2790 2018-01-11 19:03:22 The price of gas is set by oil/gasoline retailers by a bid system. Similar to an ongoing auction sale. Govt has nothing to do with it and would benefit greatly if they could lower it. Govts are among the biggest fuel buyers.

2794 2018-01-11 19:03:04 Oil threw a lot of people off.....baffled by the squeeze
2795 2018-01-11 19:03:02 Please what kind of oil.... pls my pores beg u
2796 2018-01-11 19:03:01 "Over the long term the oil price will tend to the cost of a replacement barrel ... about $70."
Guess who said that in 2014?
Alex Salmond.
2797 2018-01-11 19:02:49 @GovInslee I'm sure you know exactly how devastating offshore drilling would be here in Washington state and up an Alaska. You need to join with other Governors along the Pacific Ocean and Ensure that this plan to create more profits for big oil does not go through....
2798 2018-01-11 19:02:47 Yo I’m not laughing  I have a quarter section to shovel by hand now ! I think it’s the oil in the snowblower ?

2804 2018-01-11 19:02:23 The general public about to eat up Canola Oil's fakeass sob story huh? That's sad. Time will reveal all one day
2805 2018-01-11 19:02:23 Twitter analysts are not that educated beyond paper...
Crude oil has other stuff beyond PMS...
More so, even if the developed nations stop using it for their cars, it won't translate to the entire world doing same, not in 10 years time..
2806 2018-01-11 19:02:07 Haircut, lunch, oil change, 4 hour drive. Busy day tomorrow.
2807 2018-01-11 19:02:06 Doctors refer to this as the Google Effect (as in “ I googled this and my search says coconut oil cures cancer”).  Previously known as the Aunt Agnes Effect (as in “My Aunt Agnes says Bactine cures polio”)
2808 2018-01-11 19:02:06 stop asking consumers to ‘go green’, recycle, etc to "save the planet" & start telling the agricultural/oil industry and multi-billion corporations to cut out 99% of the shit they’re pulling every single hour of every single day
2809 2018-01-11 19:02:05 More than any pipeline oil project.... 
2810 2018-01-11 19:02:01 Coal mines aren’t picking up in Wyoming either. What happened to that promise. Oil field work isn’t great either . Very few jobs of any kind here.
2811 2018-01-11 19:02:00 You're comparing farming to oil drilling as far as environmental risk? Come on.

2815 2018-01-11 19:01:34 My favorite seasonal bath oil from my job is Polyamorous and like currently Breaking Benjamin's Polyamorous played AND THAT IS MY JAM

SO ON SUNDAY WHEN I USE THE BATH OIL, BITCH IS GONNA JAM TO POLYAMOROUS TAMBIEN
2816 2018-01-11 19:01:21 That is to say that you (1) oppose American energy independence and (2) believe we should continue to purchase oil at inflated OPEC-monopoly prices?  How do you reconcile this with our national security needs?
2817 2018-01-11 19:01:14 We don’t need no stinkin oil rigs in front  of mara friggin lago

2819 2018-01-11 19:01:09 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
2820 2018-01-11 19:01:08 Or just olive oil. I mean, that's present on most buffet spreads, right? RIGHT? And it has less bits in it!
2821 2018-01-11 19:00:56 Maintaining resources for future generations means we shouldn’t use them now but it’s ok in future as long as you use social conscience. Meanwhile import all the Arab oil you can.
2822 2018-01-11 19:00:51 kam was mad at me for having not gotten an oil change in 10k miles (i know) so he literally gave me the money to go get it done hahah i luv him
2823 2018-01-11 19:00:50 Di kase honey hinihingi nya nun. Alaska condensada na pang hot oil! HAHAHA
2824 2018-01-11 19:00:48 I guess. XD I told my sister I'd change her oil but I'm too lazy to go switch out our cars to do it. XD
2825 2018-01-11 19:00:47 The good old boy thing, did the snake oil salesman Trump approve of this
2826 2018-01-11 19:00:44 @jiffylube Employees at Store #2974 have been harassing my wife since she got there. She wanted to leave when they started loudly discussing the ‘good baby-making weather’ but they had already started changing the oil. Loud and innapropriate conversation the whole time. 
2827 2018-01-11 19:00:39 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!

2829 2018-01-11 19:00:31 Right now in Mexico, remittances are more than the state owned oil company PEMEX.  If we wanted to cripple Mexico into doing what we want  we could tax remittances at 90%.. but we're not. 
Which begs the question.. is any of this border talk real ?
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump
2830 2018-01-11 19:00:31 ...and howwwww does one square the argument that everyday people and local governments would be making the same decisions in the absence of the big mean oil companies and their influence?
2831 2018-01-11 19:00:24 Sure, I understand that.  Higher oil prices should also help out the provinces finances, atleast in the short term, which is what I care about more than what politicians it helps.
2832 2018-01-11 19:00:23 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
2833 2018-01-11 19:00:13 €1.40.9 per liter of normal 95 petrol.... Crazy... Isn't it meant to be coming down as you know peak oil is no longer an issue. And seriously Ireland why can't we get 98 Octane ffs #Motoring

2835 2018-01-11 19:00:12 The countries with the biggest Essential Oil industry are Germany and France followed by the UK and then US. Europe is the leader!
2836 2018-01-11 19:00:06 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
2837 2018-01-11 19:00:01 Hate to say it but I reckon Silverstone might be in for the chop after 2019. I know they want a new sea after activating the real clause on their old agreement but another oil rich country will probably stump up the cash
2838 2018-01-11 18:59:48 I wouldn't hold my breath with oil closing at its highest since 2014 !
2839 2018-01-11 18:59:43 @SecretaryZinke : The California coast is the perfect place for offshore oil & gas leasing.  What could possibly go wrong?
2840 2018-01-11 18:59:38 Lol. There's short term & long term. 
Long term: 
Shale
Rise of renewable energy solutions 4 everything
Electric cars. In a few years they'll stop making fuel powered vehicles. 

But no, we should bury our heads in the sands and rejoice a short-term meagre rise in oil prices 
2841 2018-01-11 18:59:34 @ALLMAX What is ALLMAX's position on adding A) hydrogenated coconut oil & B) Sucralose to the Quick Mass formula. My gut says these are both crappy ingredients.
2842 2018-01-11 18:59:27 Trump is nothing more than a thug exploiting cultures - drilling for oil off the coast of CA all for his pockets- he has got to be removed NOW!! NOW! Isn't he violating environmental regulations and civil liberties in the constitution- get the law books out!!
2843 2018-01-11 18:59:24 Yeah that’s what I’ve researched. That’s what’s so difficult for me, I don’t want to eat avocados and coconut oil all day.
2844 2018-01-11 18:59:22 Just use your Olaplex religiously and you should be fine. I also recommend you the Shu Uemura hair oil. Olaplex will only protect but won’t make it soft.
2845 2018-01-11 18:59:18 Interesting. I was under impression “the powers that be” had a vested interest in driving up prices prior to IPO to aid in valuation (again, giving deserved credence to geopolitical factors in oil), but didn’t think capital expense transfers would play a role in oil price drops
2846 2018-01-11 18:59:16 And factor in the oil boom. My sympathies.. maybe you should move 80 miles north, it's not any colder ;)
2847 2018-01-11 18:59:10 De acuerdo. El sector energético está en un momento fuertemente disruptivo como nunca antes en la historia moderna, por lo que motivar conclusiones con solo un gráfico como este (OIL/GDP per cápita) no es conveniente ni siquiera para promotores de la economía extractiva

2849 2018-01-11 18:58:40 News media are owned by corporations, many of whom are invested in big oil. Also, NON-deniers need to pressure our news orgs to cover #climatechange related issues!
2850 2018-01-11 18:58:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
2851 2018-01-11 18:58:33 Random: One of the first things you learn about taking care of a car in Nigeria is the importance of quickly rubbing engine oil on a body scratch.
2852 2018-01-11 18:58:23 What's the best brand of coconut oil for natural hair?
2853 2018-01-11 18:58:16 We know how. You screwed our state w double taxation. You borrowed 2Trillion $$ to giveaway to the richest citizens & multinational corps leaving us to pay debt. Big extras to your oil donors. GOP FAIL
2854 2018-01-11 18:58:12 The need to fix the 5T oil paint effect I get on most of my photos with a person as subject. See it for self... Take a pic of someone with your 5T and zoom in a bit.
2855 2018-01-11 18:58:02 Yes, but it isn't without its benefits. It seems to me that nothing has advanced the idea of individual autonomy quite like the automobile.

Now if we could just shake off the political power and influence of the oil industry, we could fix the carbon monoxide problem.

2857 2018-01-11 18:57:41 Any palm oil found? I love Lytham and st Anne's, but the palm oil scare has put me off a bit
2858 2018-01-11 18:57:37 Ion see how let these niggas drive ya car wen he can’t pay for yo oil change new tires break change etc
2859 2018-01-11 18:57:32 Not sure what point you're trying to make...
But it SAA fought tooth and nail for T2 and which isn't anywhere nears as significant as Omar oilfields, where as SDF was handed the largest oil supply in Syria over a couple day with no resistance.
2860 2018-01-11 18:57:26 In other words, “keep it up”.
That is primary reason Iraq, Syria, & Libya were destroyed, to take their oil offline, reduce supply, and keep prices high.
Before 1979, Abadan was highest capacity refinery & exporter of processed oil products.
2861 2018-01-11 18:57:21 You would think, since trump is always competing with other countries he'd be trying to rectify that situation but fast. Big oil/gas companies must have paid him A LOT of money to risk being second or third in line to ignore climate change this way!
2862 2018-01-11 18:57:18 Jamaican black castor oil will fix that problem  jk jk thanks, Nique 
2863 2018-01-11 18:57:18 I'm guessing the coconut oil didn't help..
2864 2018-01-11 18:57:12 dropped $30 on a tiny bottle of oregano oil because i’m an Adult (who is Very sick)
2865 2018-01-11 18:57:07 So trump&rex are doing oil deals with putin ? NOW THAT'S AGAINST THE SANCTIONS BILL  SO THE PUSSY GOP IS NOT DOING ITS JOB! WE ARE IN SOME REAL SHIT AMERICA.
2866 2018-01-11 18:57:05 All oils will go bad. Some faster than others. Olive oil, maybe 6 months after you open it?

Afaik it won't make you violently sick, it'll just taste awful.
2867 2018-01-11 18:57:00 Christ is the oil of joy! How Christian you are is measured by your joy of the Lord Jesus!
2868 2018-01-11 18:56:50 It will take a change across all industries. We’re doing our bit in two of the worst industries for diversity, oil and gas and mining.
2869 2018-01-11 18:56:48 Yes, so are we stopping all fracking and oil pipelines in CO and the country because that is the BIGGEST threat to our drinking water.
2870 2018-01-11 18:56:43 But coconut oil theater popcorn!
2871 2018-01-11 18:56:43 You, a fool: Puts oil in pan to grease it
Me, a genius: Cooks bacon first so the fat greases the pan
2872 2018-01-11 18:56:40 You must be mad because I don't use ground nut oil on my hair lol
2873 2018-01-11 18:56:29 I suspect that it has a lot to do with Mar-A-Lago being on the coast.

"No oil on my beach."

2875 2018-01-11 18:56:20 Calling anything "Italian" when it contains soybean oil is just a damn lie.

2877 2018-01-11 18:56:07 We just got some new *Ganja Gold Honey Oil 750mg THC*
2878 2018-01-11 18:56:07 Sharks were a good team on paper, but never a great team. Good part of their reg season success WAS Todd.  Until it went stale. Good part of Oil making the conf finals (counting goals right) last year was Todd.  He has his flaws, don't get me wrong.  But track record is good.
2879 2018-01-11 18:55:59 @Europaoilandgas not having much luck #Wressle refusal means loss of £4million per anum from share of oil , investors like rats leaving the #Titanic #UKOG made another bad decision with 40% of this non starter #ponzi scheme #wesaidno #DontDrillLeithHill
2880 2018-01-11 18:55:58 olive oil in the water, damn, i didn't know that one. that's a good tip!
2881 2018-01-11 18:55:56 Coconut oil!
2882 2018-01-11 18:55:37 That’s all it is. Chicken boiled in broth, ketchup, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and hoisin sauce. Fuckin gross.
2883 2018-01-11 18:55:35 I didn’t actually take it  i asked him if i could buy dog food while him and Lisandro change his moms oil
2884 2018-01-11 18:55:31 Yeah, right? I always thought the same. What a waste of precious olive oil!
2885 2018-01-11 18:55:30 It’s never just an oil change it’s an oil change and telling you the 50 other things that’s wrong with your car
2886 2018-01-11 18:55:28 nothing to be proud of McConnell. How much money have you taken from big oil? All this deregulation is bad for the environment and puts America behind other countries who are creating jobs in renewable energy. Loser policy that goes backwards not forward
2887 2018-01-11 18:55:27 @realDonaldTrump  Good old Trump doesn't want to drill for oil off the coast of Florida.....I really think his issue has more to do with Marlargo then any other reason. The liar-in-chief is more interested in his view and beach property then environmental protection.
2888 2018-01-11 18:55:24 Well, #MarALargo is in FL.  Guessing he didn’t want oil washing up on their beach?
2889 2018-01-11 18:55:18 Any rich oil prince that wants to buy me an HTC Vive?
2890 2018-01-11 18:55:09 I make mash with lots of olive oil. For that buttery colour just add 1 carrot per pan of potatoes. Bit of salt and pepper and you’re done.
2891 2018-01-11 18:55:07 I didn't know about the Olive oil.  I once got a mean recipe for sliders on a gaming forum.
2892 2018-01-11 18:54:58 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
2893 2018-01-11 18:54:57 Coconut oil gets our vote we used it on Henry's skin but also a teaspoon in his golden milk. His coat always looked good but then I'm biased 
2894 2018-01-11 18:54:56 Baba, I've added more water and palm oil to it o. Na to chop am like that. 
This wasn't how I planned my dinner *sobs* 
2895 2018-01-11 18:54:53 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
2896 2018-01-11 18:54:51 WELL, What's HOLDING US UP?
NOW WE HAVE dblasio NYC minion 
TRYING TO SUE ALL OIL Companys
GETTING READY TO WASTE MORE MONEY AND RUIN THE MANY POSSIBLITIES AND BENEFITS THAT THESE BIG CORP DO FOR ALL OF US,,WITHOUT THEM WE WOULD STILL BE BACK IN THE DARK AGES
AND
2897 2018-01-11 18:54:38 As I’m waiting for my car to get it’s oil changed, this dude looks at me and randomly goes “you’re Asian! What kind?”  how shocked was i
2898 2018-01-11 18:54:33 tonight for dinner im literally just drinking a bottle of truffle infused olive oil
2899 2018-01-11 18:54:30 How will you run your vehicles or heat your homes when you no longer have gasoline or oil?  These companies should leave your city, never to return. I imagine the people who have money will leave New York in droves and you will be left with a city of those too poor to leave.
2900 2018-01-11 18:54:09 let's keep drilling for that oil and gas
2901 2018-01-11 18:53:57 Just dipped my nuts in lavender oil and drank a liter of Pineapple Juice. Hope you had a small lunch.
2902 2018-01-11 18:53:52 Oil in water is useless as it rises to the top
2903 2018-01-11 18:53:49 Absolutely! He doesn’t want an oil spill ruining the environment around his palace. He doesn’t care what the rest of us go through.
2904 2018-01-11 18:53:29 Makes sense Florida is exempt from the oil rig offshore bill from other coastal states being more acreage of hurricanes in Gulf
2905 2018-01-11 18:53:19 Interesting. My pet theory is, I don't have much to do, as Brexit rumbles on it damages UK and Europe. Oil might like this. As might Russia.
2906 2018-01-11 18:53:07 Moloch the steel oil! Moloch the crossbone blood! Moloch the crushing circuitry!
2907 2018-01-11 18:53:05 After 3 years it’s time to re-enter #MXO oil prices bullish and moving back towards $70. I recall this poor share have difficult times back when oil was tanking in Q1 2015!
2908 2018-01-11 18:52:48 FL will still be under water in a few years, no matter where the oil is drilled from #GOPidiots
2909 2018-01-11 18:52:45 I'm a grown ass woman but I still fucken hate going to get my oil changed by myself
2910 2018-01-11 18:52:39 Sólo gas oil
2911 2018-01-11 18:52:35 Pipelines are being held up by groups funded by Soros, US-based environmental activists, and Arab oil sheikhs.
2912 2018-01-11 18:52:32 so I was seasoning my cast iron skillet and I removed the foil with the oil and the oil tucking puddled on my thumb and ow ow owwww
2913 2018-01-11 18:52:23 He doesn't do it in that way u think,I watch closely... But the bone of contention is he's trying to maintain neutrality and sometimes with the wailers.
2914 2018-01-11 18:52:17 it's called "u been was supposed to shoot me some lavender oil but u curved me"  lemme know when u find  it
2915 2018-01-11 18:52:16 @samstein I mean he can’t have oil messing up MarALago views
2916 2018-01-11 18:52:16 i have a coupon for my oil changed and they said next time it’ll be the same price even without the coupon i love being cute
2917 2018-01-11 18:52:13 Everything in balance…and I don’t think coconut oil would taste very nice on pasta! A bit sweet?
2918 2018-01-11 18:52:09 Yeah lol AT LEAST! I mean especially if we dating and years go by. Go ahead and help with that car payment and that oil change. Tires ain't cheap either lol
2919 2018-01-11 18:51:58 Oil change taking a long time  and if my phone die while I'm running I'm gonna be mad
2920 2018-01-11 18:51:42 @inkabinkabonk  ...are free of any pipelines except oil and gas!
2921 2018-01-11 18:51:36 E- Oil analyst...
2922 2018-01-11 18:51:33 Dreading my 30k maintenance. I can get an awesome camera for $500 just for a freakin maintenance and oil change
2923 2018-01-11 18:51:29 Curious.  Do these same 49% then also admit that the policies Trump he achieved thus far in reversing many of Obama's economic policies, regulations, coal and oil production, tax cuts, etc. are then helping Obama's economic policies?
2924 2018-01-11 18:51:26 If you really wanna be down, take care of the oil change, get the car cleaned up. But that’s a bit much
2925 2018-01-11 18:51:26 He was such a nice guy to me when I used to change the oil on his SUV. Sad sad story! At least we know where he is now!
2926 2018-01-11 18:51:19 Corned beef with muenster and onions, capers, and jalapeños, with hot mustard and oil and vinegar on toasted naan.
2927 2018-01-11 18:51:11 new found love for vitamin e oil
2928 2018-01-11 18:51:09 Put 4 table spoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
2929 2018-01-11 18:51:08 We earn our money the right way. We arnt an oil based team.
2930 2018-01-11 18:51:07 Use spirit or beard oil
2931 2018-01-11 18:51:05 That moment when you realize that you can’t change your oil like you had planned because you have the stinking flu. DAMN YOU FLU VIRUS!!!
2932 2018-01-11 18:50:39 The Trump administration just announced plans to vastly expand offshore oil and gas drilling, including in previously protected areas in the Arctic, the Atlantic and waters off the West Coast. More drilling means more horrific oil spills and lethal risks to wildlife. Bastard
2933 2018-01-11 18:50:26 Oil reaches $70 a barrel for the first time in three years
2934 2018-01-11 18:50:26 I once drunk a bit from bottle eith motor oil, and what ?
2935 2018-01-11 18:50:19 Wow! Mafuta imepita $70. Low oil price regime is over.
2936 2018-01-11 18:49:34 Trump meeting later today on #IranDeal but now hearing it is possible an #oil waiver decision may get pushed to early next week. Congress needs more time to show momentum for legislative fix. #OOTT @Hedgeye
2937 2018-01-11 18:49:33 No doubt the SS are distraught at the prospect of justifying a larger budget but I still maintain securing a game of Candy Crush would demand less resource
As for Iran, I'm confident you're aware that was Iranian oil money frozen by years of sanctions & a multinational effort
2938 2018-01-11 18:49:32 The price of oil in $USD is becoming increasingly irrelevant; the real question is how much does it cost in yuan?
2939 2018-01-11 18:49:27 Airlines = labor and oil. Everything else is marginal. Two headwinds not lightening up.
2940 2018-01-11 18:49:24 Instead of suing oil companies for global warming, why not invest in sustainable energy? It’s not their fault everyone is driving around in SUVs and taking planes to Cancun vacations #smh
2941 2018-01-11 18:49:20 LMAO - how American, it’s ALWAYS some-damn-body else’s fault. Simple minded ‘Muricans won’t give up any comforts but it’s some how big oil’s fault..........the height of stupid
2942 2018-01-11 18:49:08 Hey there, here are the ingredients - it has safflower oil and sesame seeds: Butternut Squash Shiitake Miso Salad (Fresh Garlic, Kosher Salt, Mirin, Rice Wine Vinegar, Miso, Safflower Oil, Black Sesame Seeds, Ginger Root, Butternut Squash, Green Onions, Fresh Shiitake Mushrooms)
2943 2018-01-11 18:49:05 I use coconut oil too! Or I heat it up with my hair dryer or on the radiator  x
2944 2018-01-11 18:49:00 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
2945 2018-01-11 18:48:57 Exactly. Difference between a roux and a white sauce is butter and milk. Roux's are oil based.
2946 2018-01-11 18:48:56 Cleaned my room, folded AND put away my laundry and booked an appointment for an oil change. I’m killing it today
2947 2018-01-11 18:48:53 He's definitely no oil painting .ugly mugly
2948 2018-01-11 18:48:52 Nah you have to go with the Rosemary and Olive Oil
2949 2018-01-11 18:48:51 Ingredient numero uno usually is soybean oil.  Straight garbage.
2950 2018-01-11 18:48:42 Cities that are suing the big oil companies for their greenhouse gas contributions should remove all gas stations immediately
2951 2018-01-11 18:48:42 behold, your gods: big oil and comptroller Scott Stringer!
2952 2018-01-11 18:48:35 I use tea tree oil for my nose piercing. Works really well.
2953 2018-01-11 18:48:18 Maybe coconut oil.
2954 2018-01-11 18:48:05 Oil topped $70 a barrel in London for the first time in three years as production cuts by OPEC and rising demand whittle away a global surplus. Shades of the future ?
2955 2018-01-11 18:47:57 Zungu n Ngwenya's is like water n oil they don't mix
2956 2018-01-11 18:47:54 Bye #tullowoil undervalued exceeding expectations. A lot of oil in west and east Africa
2957 2018-01-11 18:47:36 Future of oil??? @PerformancePOil

2959 2018-01-11 18:47:25 my skin is sooooo soft bc of the oil I got 
2960 2018-01-11 18:47:24 Besides dumping poisonous PCBs on people as a cheap and "safe" alternative to mineral oil? Not sure.
2961 2018-01-11 18:47:23 Agron oil works absolute wonders on my hair man
2962 2018-01-11 18:47:17 The benefit is you can remove and spray or oil.
2963 2018-01-11 18:46:52 I’m trying to give my cousin a free oil change and no one will answer there phones
2964 2018-01-11 18:46:50 Well Integrity Engineer (1-6 yrs) Hyderabad/Chennai/Tamilnadu/Tiruchirappalli/Kozhikode (Energy/Power/Oil and Gas/Infrastructure)...
2965 2018-01-11 18:46:45 I’ve heard that lavender essential oil helps with mosquito bites. You have to dilute it in a carrier oil & then apply it
2966 2018-01-11 18:46:44 If one of your resolutions was to eat healthier, how about switching to our rapeseed oil? As well as tasting great (we specially select our varieties of rapeseed for their flavour & rich colour) #eathealthy #rapeseedoil
2967 2018-01-11 18:46:42 #NPR just stop it! The oil companies knowingly drilled oil instead of going to renewable resources when they knowingly had research that said they were destroying the planet. It is exactly like the tobacco companies, stop being disingenuous.
2968 2018-01-11 18:46:39 Coconut oil>>>>>
2969 2018-01-11 18:46:36 you gotta make sure the oil is proper hot before you fry them, also they are still quite oily but i just pan fried them in sesame oil + honey + salt
2970 2018-01-11 18:46:29 Prices have been increasing since 2015/6. How much extra money has Scotland received as a result of these inreased oil prices?
2971 2018-01-11 18:46:16 They know they have no good justification, so just ignore... You guys need to ask why?? @RyanZinke is obviously a Patsy of oil & gas, just another bought and paid for politician
2972 2018-01-11 18:46:16 I mean, he’s basically saying Putin, you can keep the pipeline, I don’t care. We’re going to be exporters of oil, but first we need stability.
2973 2018-01-11 18:46:14 oil is dangerous
eggplant is hard to conserve
today's cooking took a turn to hell
2974 2018-01-11 18:46:13 They actually get a lot for their taxes, using the biggest “group rate” the country could possible muster (aka “Everyone!”), where USA taxes are also high, but we get very little except fighter jets and oil wars.

2978 2018-01-11 18:45:40 Oil change done
2979 2018-01-11 18:45:38 Fox and Breitbart are propaganda arms of government by and for big oil money.   The illegal votes are a Bretbart myth and Trump is a great con artist.
2980 2018-01-11 18:45:33 Oil Bears getting killed Can't believe they are still bearish after that nasty bear market
2981 2018-01-11 18:45:31 Acne & oily! Got that Italian oil, but do get dry every so often.
2982 2018-01-11 18:45:31 Transcendental Meditation can help someone access their minds true potential and work through ANYTHING!!! our minds are the MOST POWERFUL thing in the UNIVERSE !!! also fish oil, vitamin e, foods with omega3fattyacids, exercise, and journaling and shit like that v helpful

2984 2018-01-11 18:45:18 #ENERGY #OIL Wow, the mother of all oil production in the US will occur starting this early spring..
2985 2018-01-11 18:45:11 More big giveaways to Big Oil, Big Gas, Big Coal, Big Mining and wealthy special interests.  Erased from the books teacher training, coal mining runoff,  bear hunting in Alaska , roll back a methane emissions, protecting the privacy of broadband customers. Wrong for #Kentucky SAD
2986 2018-01-11 18:45:08 I have a very large pot suitable for hot tar or boiling oil, or a seafood gumbo.
2987 2018-01-11 18:45:07 Can’t wait to go home and oil my scalp  
2988 2018-01-11 18:44:55 @NYCMayor Maybe the oil companies should refuse to sell you gas for your SUV?
2989 2018-01-11 18:44:52 It would have been if the UK hadn't miserly squandered and mismanaged this most valuable asset over the last 40 years. 
We have more oil than Norway, yet they created an oil fund back then, which has grown so much that if now distributed, would make every Norwegian a millionaire!
2990 2018-01-11 18:44:42 What did you do to them? My aubergines always end up as gross oil sponges.
2991 2018-01-11 18:44:26 El gas oil no está subvencionado? Los "préstamos" no son preferenciales a largo plazo y con intereses muy bajos? Me parece q si.
2992 2018-01-11 18:44:15 Yo NPR don't be stupid. Why aren't you suing all these other people? Because the oil companies knew it was a problem they have research we've seen the research and they buried the research not giving a damn that they were going to destroy the planet!
2993 2018-01-11 18:44:11 I'll just explain to Rebekah that we're doing without oil for a while and will be mostly eating sardines, she'll completely understand
2994 2018-01-11 18:44:10 (think I've been to maybe 5 Oil Kings games ever)
2995 2018-01-11 18:44:00 Alaskan representatives believe the only important industry in Alaska is the oil industry, even though we have numerous other industries that could use incentives.

It's sad being a liberal in such a red state.
2996 2018-01-11 18:43:49 @Davidrainbolt you want to  tax wind, oil and gas, and Ag Property? So now farmers and ranches will get to pay more property tax, wind tax and oil tax.  Good thing @davidrainbolt wants to raise taxes on all working Oklahomans while his #banking industry adds none #okwind #okleg
2997 2018-01-11 18:43:48 @Revkin what if the cigarette companies lied or actively suppressed crucial information about the effects of smoking? What if the oil companies lied or actively suppressed crucial information about the effects of fossil fuel consumption? Would that change anything for you?
2998 2018-01-11 18:43:43 David Mundell doesn't represent the interests of Scotland in the UK cabinet, he's the snake oil salesman for the UK in Scotland
2999 2018-01-11 18:43:33 @cloverfoodlab - does the squash / shiitake salad have sesame OIL, as well as sesame seeds?
3000 2018-01-11 18:43:23 Please let this tea tree oil be the answer to my clear skin prayers!!! The smell makes me want to throw up but I’m hopeful!!
3001 2018-01-11 18:43:20 Another Campaign PROMISE was @POTUS Was gonna Take care of Veterans! Ant done nothing to help this vet yet? Hell I just want my Oil Industry Job back That #Obama stole with #BadIranDeal #PullingOutOfIraq I wish #Obama’s Father would of pulled out his mother! @JoeDanMedia
3002 2018-01-11 18:43:11 You do know the oil pipe you are trying to shove down our throats is Canadian? BTW there's NO CLEANEST OIL. @Tesla is clean. There's no oil industry that is clean.
3003 2018-01-11 18:43:07 TBH you probably just need an oil change! That’s what mine was.
3004 2018-01-11 18:43:03 Moisturize your face at night with coconut oil before you sleep so you can repair your dead skin pigments while your body cools..
3005 2018-01-11 18:42:57 @realDonaldTrump
@mike_pence 
Let’s NOT be fooled by NOKO’s willingness to “come to the table” to talk peace! Let’s remember Japan was in discussions w/America re buying USA Oil while secretly plotting their attack on Pearl Harbor! Kim Jung Fatso isn’t exactly a pillar of Trust!
3006 2018-01-11 18:42:55 My husband and son-in-law work in oil&gas. Hubby has had women engineers in his well control classes, and women are not unheard of on my SiL’s ship, either. They are out there. 
3007 2018-01-11 18:42:49 Mar-A-Lago guests don't want to be able to see oil rigs when they take their yachts out.
3008 2018-01-11 18:42:44 Just found out the reason no one changes their own oil is because the shit is expensive. 
3009 2018-01-11 18:42:42 $70/Barrel for oil. Supply & demand at its finest. Two oil tankers “collide” in the middle of the ocean & oil skyrockets! #EconomicsAtItsFinest
3010 2018-01-11 18:42:39 Makeup: mattifying setting spray or powder and I'm always wondering why I'm a oil slick by lunchtime

3012 2018-01-11 18:42:05 what about the massive windfarm, that we paid 400mill for....? oh yeah, thats right its owned by a saudi oil firm based in texas, that sells 100% of the electricity produced to the usa, and employs no one locally.....siteC will be another scam, paid for with taxes, VOTE THEM OUT
3013 2018-01-11 18:42:00 I haven’t tried the hair oil at all! I must try it at some point!
3014 2018-01-11 18:41:53 Liquor? That's an essential oil, right?
3015 2018-01-11 18:41:53 I HATE medication. I barley take the ones I have and the mf gave me 100 like wtf? I only take it if nothing else helps me. The essential oils really help a lot. Lavender is my favorite. You should look into an Oil Diffuser too?
3016 2018-01-11 18:41:51  that's hilarious, why should Trump do that, I'm a Californian and I want the drilling. The tree huggers never tell you that the natural seepage that occurs when you're not alleviating the pressure on oil Reserves via Drilling exceeds the amount of oil from oil spills.
3017 2018-01-11 18:41:49 coconut oil is the answer to everything
3018 2018-01-11 18:41:46 Economic growth prior to the widespread use of crude oil was virtually 0.
3019 2018-01-11 18:41:45 Drink water, use Castro oil and stay in my lane.
3020 2018-01-11 18:41:41 Good Q. Not directly related IMO. However, $100B IPO will take $100B of investor capital away from oil investment elsewhere. That’s a lot.
3021 2018-01-11 18:41:21 Yep just have to  I now want my oil shares to rise painful seeing oil rise and the lag.

3024 2018-01-11 18:40:55 I keep forgetting to get more black castor oil & bobbie pins from the beauty supply 
3025 2018-01-11 18:40:43 To tell the truth , I didn’t do a proper follow up on their story, Judging from this post Khanyi has regrets.

Trumps have admitted taking Russian money for years.
Trump co bought oil co shares that can't get oil out of Chrimea because sanctions.
Trump tells Russians that sanctions will go away.
Russians fk with 'murica election,
Trump doesn't sign sanctions.
looks guilty.....
3037 2018-01-11 18:39:53 Up 2% in oil and 1% on NAS100 letting it run. #profitableweek #trading #forex
3038 2018-01-11 18:39:51 It'll be ironic if making a special offshore oil drilling exemption for Florida ends up being a bigger political mistake than including the state in the plan in the first place.
3039 2018-01-11 18:39:38 Few months back some analysts here questioned why Nigeria was still investing in finding more crude, their argument, Oil was no longer relevant.

Today oil price is $70bp
May touch $80bp mid 2018
3040 2018-01-11 18:39:31 this is stupid. 3/4 of oil production is conducted by Government owned enterprises.

3042 2018-01-11 18:39:20 For my dads Mclaren the first annual service was around $2000 and an oil change by itself is around $500+ depending on where you go
3043 2018-01-11 18:39:19 At the heart of it is Oil & Gas corporations having their way. Mentioning over development. The NDP didn't get rid of the tax breaks for oil & gas.. Thus continuous expansion.. It's not one party
3044 2018-01-11 18:39:18 There isn’t an oil production shortage, so again, explain to my why this is necessary? We have an enormous surplus. Not all states want to be Texas and frankly, it’s a violation of our states rights.

3048 2018-01-11 18:38:24 It means they need some ground to stand on for future hostilities and an oil grab.
3049 2018-01-11 18:38:23 I am a coastal Floridian and while this deal is dirty as hell, I am glad it's not happening but I would like to park one of those oil rigs right in front of Mar-a-lago. I mean since he thinks wind turbines are such an eyesore!

3053 2018-01-11 18:37:57 they wouldn't be "dangerous" if humans didn't sell the forest land to the palm oil industry driving elephants and other animals into the paths of humans. When humans and elephants compete for the same food, that's when they're "dangerous".

3055 2018-01-11 18:37:45 Never trust a Nigel: he's scheming. He's probably got a plan to flood the EU with snake oil or summat.
3056 2018-01-11 18:37:25 It actually has a surprisingly short shelf life, but as long as it doesn't make you gag it should be okay to cook with. 

But I've given up on olive oil, it's hard to get stuff that isn't rancid right from the store.

Grape seed oil is what I get now.

3058 2018-01-11 18:37:06 Good Q when oil drilling is major cause of LA's coast disappearing.
3059 2018-01-11 18:37:00 Sad that! We have to wait for farmers markets in the spring. Then the bakers come out and the beekeepers and the fellow with the good Greek olive oil. On a happier note our egg source has producing hens again.
3060 2018-01-11 18:36:55 Wow... heartbreaking news of Oruma's relapse. Saw him early last year he looked just fine, told me the worst was behind him. So sad!! The number of folks taken in by this Oil Scam ehn... from Generals to Top Pastors to Civil Servants to Ex-Govs...
3061 2018-01-11 18:36:54 If you see what he just did about opening up all of our coasts to oil drilling it is confirmation of where his allegiances are. I'm just wondering what you think. I'd like to know.
3062 2018-01-11 18:36:52 Ha! If you keep some tahini, garlic, oil and lemon on hand you can whip up a quick hummus whenever you want with those chickpeas!
3063 2018-01-11 18:36:50 Diamonds tween my knees, oil wells in thighs, does my sassiness upset you? Oh, you mad cause I survived?
3064 2018-01-11 18:36:50 Are you bored?

Do you own a wax/oil burner?

Melt down 2 of the cubes, then pour the melted oil into a sink of cold water. It looks like something straight out of one of those "most satisfying videos ever" compilations on YouTube.

Just, uhm, don't let it go down the drain.
3065 2018-01-11 18:36:44 HQ of Standard Oil (then Exxon) for many years, still the HQ of Hess, an important fraction of Wall Street underwriting and stock trading is oil & gas related, etc, etc
3066 2018-01-11 18:36:43 Feits you ever done a coconut oil mask for your hair? Shampoo after that and you’re good for the week.
3067 2018-01-11 18:36:40 A even bigger sin in my opinion is bearish Oil ....just getting one sector right would have helped the dismal performance
3068 2018-01-11 18:36:32 Does this not compete directly with that Infinity SUV? The ugly one loved by oil industry captains?
3069 2018-01-11 18:36:30 The cost of a barrel of oil has topped $70 for the first time in just over three years.

3079 2018-01-11 18:35:16 NatGas is a great hedge if Oil keeps going up. Got a lot more upside too.
3080 2018-01-11 18:35:14 cant predict the future. looks like some demand is there for oil, market isnt stupid to get past 60.
3081 2018-01-11 18:35:14 another hole in your theory: if Stalin was doing everything in his power to secure the new Polish territory against Nazi advance, what in the fresh hell was he doing trying to take the Karelian oil fields from Finnland?

3086 2018-01-11 18:34:29 And it's not just the money. It's a pride thing. All our food: pizza, calzone, buffalo moozarell', olive oil. These fucks had nothin'. They ate pootsie before we gave them the gift of our cuisine. But this, this is the worst. This expresso shit.

3093 2018-01-11 18:34:08 Vietnam invites India to invest in oil & natural gas sector in the South China Sea.  We are in right direction.  India should make strong relations with Nations in the Asia Pacific region. And also include Taiwan in its deep-relationship Policy.

3102 2018-01-11 18:33:02 Oh we call them zucchini here, they're good baked in a little olive oil but you've got to get rid of all the liquid in them. I sometimes bake them with some mince and onions in the middle like we used to do with marrow when I was growing up
3103 2018-01-11 18:33:01 Check your manual to see when you should get an oil change! My car is whenever my oil percentages reaches 15% or I can do 5,000 miles.
3104 2018-01-11 18:33:01 You should change your name to @WrongScotland - Westminster controls oil revenues, *not* Holyrood.

3113 2018-01-11 18:32:29 It’s a sad day when your pen has no more oil

3120 2018-01-11 18:32:00 Oh do you! I used to add coconut oil but it was fine without for aaaaaaages
3121 2018-01-11 18:31:45 And oil/gas is decayed plant/animal matter, so I guess that is biomass too.
3122 2018-01-11 18:31:40 If you were surprised by the uprisal of fake news since 2016 guess what, he's a bloody pioneer and his reputation is just that. Fake news.
The human kind needs to get rid of people like him who work just for the interest of a decaying industry. The oil industry.

3126 2018-01-11 18:31:26 Ooooo yeah! I used to add coconut oil I have no clue why I stopped!
3127 2018-01-11 18:31:22 How would it ruin S.C.? And how if we have the largest oil resource in the world, that has barley been tapped into, make it a “lessening finite resource”? It replenishes it’s self over time. Your media talking points hold no water. Just as “the polar ice caps will be gone by2015”
3128 2018-01-11 18:31:02 Moringa oil, smells like play doh? Y/n pls respond

3131 2018-01-11 18:30:43 There are few retailers one can buy there. The rest of the bunch - banks, oil cos - it’s just a bet in the oil price. Sberbank’s correlation with the oil price is very high.
3132 2018-01-11 18:30:42 This is a political stunt for Rick Scott's senate run. Plain & simple. No one in this administration gives a crap about the environment. The only reason they would b upset with an oil spill is the wasted $$.
3133 2018-01-11 18:30:40 I’d be so into that. I also think the Oilers should bring back the Oil Derrick guy on their shoulders.

3147 2018-01-11 18:29:39 @Kwik_Fit You have a mot + service. They don’t fit the oil filter correctly so it leaks oil, change a tyre and damage the alloy, scratch the front bumper. Return and the staff are rude. Report to head office, told the area manager will call you. Then NOTHING!!

3160 2018-01-11 18:28:19 I remember they mocked the SNP for suggesting that oil could be worth as much as £800,000,000.
3161 2018-01-11 18:27:48 I understand. I would like people to understand why cannabis is illegal & Schedule I which worked to eliminate any discussion regarding the benefits of hemp.There has to be a reason R.Nixon ignored the Shafer Commission. IMHO, eliminating competition for oil was a reason.
3162 2018-01-11 18:27:46 Ha ha ha haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa you mean like the judge nominee who filed at most 2 documents? Or the epa oil tycoon pruitt? Or even better how about the debt collecting  evolution denying creationism supporting  bitch @BetsyDeVosED? You mean those people

3171 2018-01-11 18:26:38 As the Secretary fully understands, former Governor Bush pushed for more wind energy development in Texas because it was a jobs issue, not because he was green. Again, wind, not oil or coal, but wind! Solar might work the same way. Try it. You'll like it.

3192 2018-01-11 18:23:43 This is an extremely ignorant hot take. Without the cattle industry/cowboy culture and ensuing oil booms (which resulted from oil being found on cattle ranches) Texas wouldn’t be what it is today.

3194 2018-01-11 18:23:42 The Guillem gossip is that £20 does not buy much for your money these days. Pep may have to persuade the Sheiks that parting with 15 litres of petrol money is not spilling oil on troubled Balague maths.
3195 2018-01-11 18:23:36 What about Carrier? After your highly publicized so called deal to keep/bring jobs thousands moved to Mexico and more cuts just announced! Your “show” was a SHAM, just like your presidency! Snake oil salesman!!!

3231 2018-01-11 18:20:00 Thanks.  Yes, when my father was an "able seaman" in the Merchant Marine during WW-2, he was a bigger target as a civilian (crossing the Pacific on oil tankers) than he was while he was in the Army.  (He boxed before and after the war.)  In his 30s, he looked like Paul Newman.

3273 2018-01-11 18:14:27 Oh yeah! I took a couple trips out there for samples and to try to make deals with the Blackfoot nation when I was in oil. We were working on some conventional oil plays, but the shale gas people got there first.

3276 2018-01-11 18:14:21 did they expand on that ie where the leaks were, as many cars do develop both overtime usually you can tell if ya gasket has gone by checking the oil to see if water is actually in it - was car getting a service or looked at for a specific fault  ? cud ask them 2 Xplain

3281 2018-01-11 18:13:38 That won't cap production of oil from shale plays but it may further limit refiners ability to use it. That has never mattered to producers in the past. They must have production growth to maintain valuation multiples on stock prices. If investors don't care, why should they?

3293 2018-01-11 18:12:48 You've all heard the news about Trump NOT wanting an oil rig off the coast of Florida to inhibit the pristine view of resort goers. Fight back on your coastline! That is a one-man band move of maniacal behavior. (edited)
3294 2018-01-11 18:12:28 MAC's studio fix fluid foundation & oil control lotion literally saved my makeup game
3295 2018-01-11 18:12:20 And how about making the oil companies release the advanced clean energy technology they buy and shelf every time someone invents it
3296 2018-01-11 18:12:19 Just put chilli oil on my pizza, not realising it already had chillies on it
3297 2018-01-11 18:12:08 Ive been using cleansing oil instead of face wash for my very dry skin and its one of the best decisions Ive made. Also exfoliating really well then taking a bath and putting scented body oil in it is 
3298 2018-01-11 18:12:07 Ah, its cuticle oil... I don't even know what that is but its cuticle oil
3299 2018-01-11 18:11:54 Well if oil is $70 a bbl today we good man 
#sigh
3300 2018-01-11 18:11:32 @blenderhd My Indy Eleven are USL bound buddy. They are talking about playing some games at Lucas Oil. I may have to hit 65 S and come see them play L'ville. Fun times.
3301 2018-01-11 18:11:16 It’s my first day off from the gym of 2018 and I’m spending it having breakfast alone while getting an oil change. It feels so liberating.
3302 2018-01-11 18:11:14 Collecting the sound of silence with changing an oil filter, foolishly
3303 2018-01-11 18:11:14 torque olive oil tempers my bib saddled
3304 2018-01-11 18:11:01 We're only $0.50 away from $70 per barrel on Brent Crude oil.... Can we dare to dream of $80 ?
3305 2018-01-11 18:10:56 Oh shit I did see this! I am loving it, the girl is just brilliant. “It’s OK to take from The Man.” “Who is The Man?” “The Man? The Man! The man with all of the oil” is a standout line so far for me.
3306 2018-01-11 18:10:50 Time to turn NY/NJ/CT waste cooking oil into Renewable Diesel? 
3307 2018-01-11 18:10:43 Im sorry but you don't realize In fact, demand for oil will increase and will not be replaced by any new energy for future energy demand 
3308 2018-01-11 18:10:30 Do you realise a weak pound means that the country's wealth is exactly 1/3 of what it used to be 10 yrs ago, that no one wants to invest in a country where your assets depreciate due to its sinking currency and that imports are exactly 1/3 more expensive inc oil. What a dickhead.

3313 2018-01-11 18:10:09 Maybe America will wake up but we will be swimming in oil spills and drinking clean coal water.
3314 2018-01-11 18:10:08 I ve a suggestion if ur lips are getting chapped, apply almond oil or mustard oil in ur navel. Its a unbeatable remedy for chapped lips.
3315 2018-01-11 18:10:08 Can't wear it because you've gone down the Castor Seed Oil route in your ingredients. The list of lipsticks I can use is decreasing daily.

3319 2018-01-11 18:09:51 .......or baby oil
3320 2018-01-11 18:09:46 I’m ready for water parks, the beach, tanning oil, and just being in summer
3321 2018-01-11 18:09:39 I’m getting my oil changed in my car over my lunch break.. this is peak adulthood 
3322 2018-01-11 18:09:33 2. Spoon the oil into a heavy-based wide saucepan and put on medium heat. When warm, add the chopped vegetables from the processor and cook for 5-10 minutes, until soft but not coloured.
3323 2018-01-11 18:09:31 I finally bought more coconut oil n I’m instantly happy
3324 2018-01-11 18:09:23 Peppermint oil is a better deterrent I hear...
3325 2018-01-11 18:09:15 Big oil,
3326 2018-01-11 18:09:12 With coconut flakes, coconut cream, and coconut oil alone, one could live a decent life.
3327 2018-01-11 18:08:53 US Dollar Index too skewed $EUR (57.6%) *it’s poor “measurement of USD”. Misses impact of the $AUD $NZD & many other #FX. I prefer USD denominated #commodities, like #Gold $GC_F or #Oil $CL_F. USD going to go lower but won’t hurt U.S. Stocks, think #Yen vs. #Nikkei for reference.

3332 2018-01-11 18:08:07 Brent crude @$70
OPEC's cut has taken out a volume of supply equivalent to Nigeria's output. Imagine a world of oil without Nigeria producing!

spray your heart with the oil of olive and tell the eternal giver i love you...
3335 2018-01-11 18:07:51 Has anyone ever used essential oil diffuser for headaches/insomnia? pls give your reviews.
3336 2018-01-11 18:07:50 Watched the presser with the leader of Norway with Trump.  He said he likes "massive" oil and gas and didn't care for what his predecessor thought about renewable energy at all.  In the next breath looks over to her and said I love your hydro power, we should do more of that here
3337 2018-01-11 18:07:47 Wow you really pissed off a lot of states trying to pull that oil drilling scheme huh? Could be much worse, could be Scott Pruitt considering lifting age requirements to handle hazardous chemicals.
3338 2018-01-11 18:07:34 those were the years we had high oil AND gas prices. We are already in a revenue shortfall position and all the UCP can do is give rich people a tax break?? Give your head a shake. #ableg

NYC mayor suing oil companies for global warming. It'll fail, but gives me an idea.

We could sue the circumcision industry every time a man molests a child or rapes. Instead of a lie detector test they should see if he's circumcised.

3341 2018-01-11 18:07:25 As I said, both Republicans and Democrats are complicit in their drive to seize control of the land/water/gas/oil and minerals. Really. That's what it's all about. And the Democrats do not need rural votes, for they've got the urban pretty well secured.
3342 2018-01-11 18:07:24 Baby is cold outside.  #freezing oil change 325i
3343 2018-01-11 18:07:24 Ask my wife, when I'm not starving myself, I only get the coconut or toasted coconut donut at Dunkin. I make snacks with coconut oil and coconut flakes, processing them with walnuts.
3344 2018-01-11 18:07:22 When you go in for a new battery and oil change and end up needing new brakes and tires as well 
3345 2018-01-11 18:07:22 The hardest thing about being a college student with a job is finding time to get a damn oil change 
3346 2018-01-11 18:07:14 @realDonaldTrump is afraid to be interviewed by Mueller & his team of prosecutorial experts, and rightly so, Donny Dementia will be easily trapped into lying by his own narcissism while his legal team of snake oil barkers will be unable to prevent the perjury
#badchicken stinks
3347 2018-01-11 18:07:11 Dill, sea salt, and olive oil Triscuts for the win.
3348 2018-01-11 18:07:07 In the point in the reading were they compared Data to Oil I found to be a very interesting comparison. In the modern media age our online presence and all of  our data is being sold as a commodity more & more.       #XUCOMM221
3349 2018-01-11 18:07:04 Fuck the winter.I moisturize every day and my skin still feels like Godzilla. I just want to cover my whole body in coconut oil, roll myself up in Saran Wrap, and marinate for 12 hours.

3352 2018-01-11 18:06:46 So I’m at Valvoline trying to get an oil change and idk why it’s taking them so long! So much for getting things done on my lunch break
3353 2018-01-11 18:06:41 I’m still tryna find that miracle potion lol.. Muthafuckas gassed me with the Black castor oil smh
3354 2018-01-11 18:06:32 Someone needs to invent a top coat to put on after lipstick so it doesn’t transfer, water proof/ oil proof.
3355 2018-01-11 18:06:27 “I am for massive oil and gas and everything else and a lot of energy. I am for the strongest military that the United States ever had. My opponent was not for a strong military and my opponent was for windmills” - a fucking 2nd grader's energy and defense policy

3359 2018-01-11 18:05:41 Oil hit $64 today  #Merica 
3360 2018-01-11 18:05:37 No, lots of tiny cars and retro motorcycles everywhere. I'm told the government, having discovered a big oil deposit in the last few years, is selling it to other SA countries at a loss (for market share), and bilking their citizens. Petrol costs 3x-4x what it does in CA.
3361 2018-01-11 18:05:35 Every recipe I like starts with "Pan: on. Tablespoon* olive oil: in"

3365 2018-01-11 18:05:09 The oceans & land belong to the PEOPLE! Not to these rich greedy old bastards & oil companies  trying to make more money & fill their pockets, when disasters happen they don’t want to take the blame & damage the environment, kill ocean & coastal land !

3367 2018-01-11 18:04:48 It’s common knowledge that NYC has absolutely no need for, or benefits from, any products of oil companies

3369 2018-01-11 18:04:19 Senators like Tim Kaine, who voted against the Dreamers, certainly will.  Too many pipeline owners & big Pharma, Big Oil recipients in the @DNC @TheDemocrats 
They need to be primaried.
3370 2018-01-11 18:03:59 Bring a little bottle in my pocket and come out from under the brand new Jeep with oil on my hands

 install coils

Gonna be a productive weekend
3376 2018-01-11 18:03:33 This at the same time, Trump's banning oil drilling opposite Mar A Lago, while permitting it all along the rest of the coast?
3377 2018-01-11 18:03:26 "I hear"
"Some people say"
"I read an article"

Translation:  I'm an idiot who gets my "facts" from morons or paid shills for all-natural snake oil.

Ugh.  *hugs*

3379 2018-01-11 18:03:20 #IxoraBBSkinCareTips When you have dry skin, layering your skin from water based to oil based seals the moisture in for longer periods.
3380 2018-01-11 18:03:11 For decades Nigeria has been exporting oil but could not produce it for local consumption
3381 2018-01-11 18:03:05 Oil prices were a big upside during the Chavez years. You could accuse the government of mismanagement in how it responded to the decline in oil prices, but you could also consider that Venezuela's starting position was very weak to begin with.
3382 2018-01-11 18:02:49 @DKingBH In all seriousness, if you ran Blue Jays, would you offer Donaldson a 5-yr deal for $30M per, which included 2018? And if you were him, do you take it?
3383 2018-01-11 18:02:46 When I hear that someone doesn't like me because of the essential oil company I use, all I can think is "gosh, there are way better reasons to not like me. Pick a better one!"
3384 2018-01-11 18:02:34 Oil companies should suspend oil sales to NY, just saying.
3385 2018-01-11 18:02:34 Or olive oil
3386 2018-01-11 18:02:33 yes,olive oil poured there made the spot even more slippery, cars falling like never before
3387 2018-01-11 18:02:22 You meant Shale ? Yes , We are receiving regular shipments of Shale Oil from the Amrikis and at bulk negotiated rates.

3398 2018-01-11 18:01:34 @realDonaldTrump did not kept his promises to average people like Carrier bring back jobs instead Carrier lost 127 or be good to DACA instead their lives hangs on stupid wall..but he kept promise on tax cut to billioners, destroy enviro for oil companies @nytimes @foxandfriends
3399 2018-01-11 18:01:29 Went in for a oil change and realized they the ecr was leaking. Air freight the parts in and as of 1 today they don’t know where they are.

3401 2018-01-11 18:01:25 There isn’t much sympathy for oil and gas in light of our shameful Teacher salaries.
3402 2018-01-11 18:01:23 They don’t care! But try to put an oil well anywhere near his resort.. now he cares. He cares deeply. (Even though he’s for drilling elsewhere).. Trump is a real piece of work.

3413 2018-01-11 18:00:10 So let's say $x-(a+b+c.....+subsidy+y+z) is the amount that goes from NNPC to fgn account.

Where a, b, c, etc are NNPCs internal expenditure, oil theft, maintainance of oil facilities etc.
3414 2018-01-11 18:00:08 fresh tomatoes are useless garbage tomatoes are healthier when cooked with oil than raw  look it up
3415 2018-01-11 18:00:06 Every time the Dems do something positive (stance against big oil in NYC), or the Feinstein release then they go and support increasing surveillance. I’d bang my head against the wall but it already has so many lumps!
3416 2018-01-11 17:59:57 try to always take your dad or carson if he’s home  everywhere I’ve went by myself they tell me that my car is messed up and it needs hundreds more than just an oil change because they manipulate girls because we “don’t know” 
3417 2018-01-11 17:59:53 Yes. For sure. And dissipated any oil between then and the 17th when search efforts increased.

3420 2018-01-11 17:59:40 Ah, I see. I was just comparing with my old DFV pistons which had precious little skirt below the oil ring, just enough to hold the gudgeon pin. The crown was flat, so all explained  another thing I've learned today.

3424 2018-01-11 17:59:08 lavender is the best essential oil to fall asleep to don’t @ me
3425 2018-01-11 17:58:59 NNPC forced the marketers out as their way of stopping payment subsidies. Now NNPC being a regulator shouldn’t even be selling. This is why we have scarcity. Also helps NNPC not to be transparent about how much is being earned from oil sale
3426 2018-01-11 17:58:56  ราคาตอนนี้อยู่ที่เท่าไหร่คะ
3427 2018-01-11 17:58:53 @realDonaldTrump  what do you expect, we have been lied to from day one, #Columbus #gaza #oil #gold #wars its all a lie, the usa is big lie trump is just part of the usa 15, nwo takeover, the only way out is #revolution
3428 2018-01-11 17:58:40 How are we supposed to believe that after the keystone pipeline has already had a major leak in its short existence. Not to mention a bunch of offshore oil disasters. The gulf coast is still recovering. Is there any specific reason things would be different in the future?
3429 2018-01-11 17:58:33 Johnsons And you can oil them with coconut oil
3430 2018-01-11 17:58:32 Count me among your conservative constituents who feel this was an awful decision.  We need to drill and develop oil and gas reserves and continue towards energy independence.  Why should Florida be exempt
3431 2018-01-11 17:58:28 All I had this morning was some black coffee. I’m coming around to the taste of motor oil. But I know one thing. When I touch down in Texas. WE FEAST!!!!

3434 2018-01-11 17:58:25 ใช้ของ oriental princess อ่ะ ขาดส้ม มีโทนเนอ, power c, boosting serum ทา hip oil หลังโทนเนอ ทาจากเนื้อบางสุดไปเนื้อเข้มสุด ไปดูในเนตมา 55
3435 2018-01-11 17:58:24 Well I guess it’s time for us to shutoff the oil. We are the largest provider of oil to the USA. We can keep it ourselves or sell it elsewhere. We tried...
3436 2018-01-11 17:58:15 He's scared.

Even with his 212 IQ he knows he & his snake oil salesmen lawyers are no match for Mueller & his prosecutorial team of experts.
Trump is a liar & will be easily trapped by his own narcissism.
It's not some horrible trickery by liberal monsters to trap him.

He lies.
3437 2018-01-11 17:58:15 Oil reaches $70 a barrel for first time in three years.

3441 2018-01-11 17:58:01 And the styles of dresses on my Pinterest page and the actual dresses I like are like oil and water. Never would have thought.
3442 2018-01-11 17:58:00 yep, so you have lime oil at a rate much more expensive than a) lime oil at a store b) an actual fucking lime
3443 2018-01-11 17:57:53 Omds wallahi I knew you'd say that. I swear down I've never come across an odd opinion that you don't uphold...Aseeda with olive oil, bamya  you flippin scare me bro
3444 2018-01-11 17:57:52 Though it's flat-out wrong, it kind of thrills me that we've reached a point where anyone thinks attacking big oil is "easy & obvious". Without divestment underscoring the rational (and municipal!) nature of an immediate renewables revolution, few would think it either one.
3445 2018-01-11 17:57:48 放送時間以外は文句ないようん
3446 2018-01-11 17:57:38 I disagree with u on that Andy. The oil co knew their products wld drive global warming frm their own scientists from the 50s 60s and they the opted aggressively to pursue profit at the cost of catastrophe.

Guilty.

3450 2018-01-11 17:57:20 Russia doesn't like the US to have a stronger Military. Done by Trump
Russia doesn't like the US to have it's own strong Energy supplies (gas and oil) and jobs. Done by @realDonaldTrump 
Putin probably preferred a lying, corrupt Hillary.
3451 2018-01-11 17:57:19 I feel like a lot of the Trump presidency has stood on "repeal things at the federal level (healthcare being the big one, but I think there's been others in terms of Bank/oil oversight, EPA regulations) and leave it to the states to regulate."
3452 2018-01-11 17:57:18 1) Chavismo was a political and economic sham; obvious to any Western educated adult who examined its millenarian claims against its actual “achievements” (which were dismal compared even to states with no oil wealth). Yet it attracted intellectuals like moths to a flame. Why?
3453 2018-01-11 17:57:15 Suddenly, Nifty will fall 100 points and all news channels will attribute this (big) fall to rising oil prices. 
3454 2018-01-11 17:57:10 うむ
3455 2018-01-11 17:57:04 Hope they change the oil pump as it's the weak link on the GT3 McLaren.
3456 2018-01-11 17:57:00 At $69.79 oil price highest for last three years. #Brent
3457 2018-01-11 17:56:59 When you can tell when they've changed the oil in their fryers, that's worse.  Grateful for small mercies :)
3458 2018-01-11 17:56:48 Totally agree. And the Argan oil healed my face recently. Love this stuff and the positive vibes Josie puts into the world 
3459 2018-01-11 17:56:46 WV put a ton of eggs in that basket but with oil low they haven’t been producing much, was supposed to be a plant near my hometown but ???
3460 2018-01-11 17:56:41 This is the guy that says he's excited for offshore oil drilling off the shores of Louisiana, so that they can fix the problems to their coasts caused by the last oil spill.
3461 2018-01-11 17:56:39 Thatcher and North Sea oil
3462 2018-01-11 17:56:36 any commentary on oil mania? sir :) :)
3463 2018-01-11 17:56:24 Well oil be forked
3464 2018-01-11 17:56:10 One of the reasons there are unions. Had she slashed pay it would have had a dramatic effect on consumer demand, causing more lost jobs, more bankruptcies, a faster downward spiral. At what point does the oil sector accept some responsibility for the cycles in their industry?
3465 2018-01-11 17:56:04 When you have nothing against Modi enquire about his mobile phone bill, clothes. Is there any limit to low level of politics? Next what, who pays for @narendramodi 's hair oil and comb?
3466 2018-01-11 17:56:02 Does ANYONE remember that we have a West Coast? All I hear is "What about Maryland, Virginia, etc". What about Washington State? We have vulnerable Orca whale pods, Humpbacks that migrate off our shores, fishing and crabbing industries. Trump can shove his oil rigs up his cofveve
3467 2018-01-11 17:55:54 with #oil above 70, guess what'll happen with #inflation worldwide #justsaying
3468 2018-01-11 17:55:50 just took my fish oil pill w a glass of white wine. health and elegance in 2018
3469 2018-01-11 17:55:46 Came at the right time to get my oil changed. They giving dollars off everything.
3470 2018-01-11 17:55:45 People pray for cake, so God gives them batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, but then they get frustrated & leave the kitchen. Sometimes it’s all right in front of us, but we give up. Make. Your. Cake.
3471 2018-01-11 17:55:42 @msnbc Between RUSSIA "hacking" our past election and VIRTU PARTNERS of BELGRADE YUGOSLAVIA "hacking" the CCM that affects everything considered commodities like GAS/HEATING OIL "we the people" can't get a break.

3479 2018-01-11 17:55:03 I think @climatebabes better TOS little more research to the point they are trying make here. You are absolutely correct @Breeze_CA. Without fossil fuels none of this is possible including Twitter as our devices are made with a by product of OIL!
3480 2018-01-11 17:54:47 Needing some motivation to leave my house today. Is there an essential oil for that?
3481 2018-01-11 17:54:41 After USS Thresher imploded there was only a small oil slick on the surface. There was a support ship at the surface when it happened and that’s all they ever saw.
3482 2018-01-11 17:54:36 get an oil change or nap on my lunch 
3483 2018-01-11 17:54:19 Is this about the MDL oil&gas storage facility?
3484 2018-01-11 17:54:06 It's big oil that ultimately will kill us all, and Trump with his drill-baby-drill policies is an accomplice.
3485 2018-01-11 17:54:04 Extraction – we us an advanced distillation process that provides pharmaceutical purity in our oil production for our white labeling and vape cartridge divisions, as well as for our hallmark product CannaStrips™.
3486 2018-01-11 17:53:59 Wait till they tokenize airplanes and bulldozers.  CVX trading like oil is $110 too.
3487 2018-01-11 17:53:55 Just curious as to who has stock in “shell companies” that perhaps are tied to Russian oil..and perhaps if that’s another reason why DC so eager to dissolve sanctions against Russia! Similarly,some have stock in DAPL,thus the push to get done..
3488 2018-01-11 17:53:52 If you really want to honor & respect @edbegleyjr Los Angeles must step up & end urban oil drilling, divest, & sue the oil companies like NYC is doing -instead of offering us photo ops and plaques. #ClimateEmergency #ShutItAllDown
3489 2018-01-11 17:53:42 @CFLosLibertador  desde curva 13 a curva 18 micro perdiendo gas oil. Todo la mano que sube está sucia

3495 2018-01-11 17:53:01 Meanwhile, the oil and gas employers in that area have to ship people in to work because the locals are still waiting for the mines to reopen.

3497 2018-01-11 17:52:14 Got my oil changed, Paid all my bills, credit score went up 120 points  and I get payed tomorrow... I think this calls for a celebratory nap 
3498 2018-01-11 17:52:09 Vegan rant: Telling vegans that they should worry about fast fashion, palm oil, farmers who are paid unfair wages etc. is redundant. Usually
3499 2018-01-11 17:51:34 Raising your hucksterism level, I see. Try peddling that snake oil to someone else. The new full time wage of $17k a year is not a living wage and Walmart’s “benefits” can cost employees up to 70% of that wage. How do they eat or pay rent?

3501 2018-01-11 17:51:15 Oil rich countries set to make billions while Canada will loose billions all because of green fanatics misguided perceptions about our oil
3502 2018-01-11 17:51:13 Realist shit I ever read: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
3503 2018-01-11 17:51:12 They can't really defend an oil field and the fighters to the south were focused on the defense of abukamal. Although this claim is also BS.
3504 2018-01-11 17:51:09 I just bought soke Jamaican castor oil and i sweardagawd if i get my beard right it’s over for yall
3505 2018-01-11 17:50:50 Have you found the source of that voice, that is akin to how a drop of lukewarm oil traverses in ur ear; warming you up from within, tingling gently while shutting all the other senses for a while? 

Have you? No? Find one.

3507 2018-01-11 17:50:34 We have had better solutions with green energy for decades. Get your nose online and research! End of oil is a great thing!

3509 2018-01-11 17:50:22 Greek salad with extra tomatoes, red wine vinegar + light oil is how this waist is going to get right 
3510 2018-01-11 17:50:19 The only reason that oil is not going to be drilled in Florida which by the way is my state is because Rick Scott crawled up Donald Trump's ass and died there. Donald Trump also owns a home on the East Coast. That's why Florida escaped.
3511 2018-01-11 17:50:11 Just spilled my £25 balsamic oil ON THE FUCKING FLOOR KILL ME NOW 
3512 2018-01-11 17:50:08 @kat23 also SNP is oil as well getting close to sell target.
3513 2018-01-11 17:50:08 Coffee grounds , honey, and coconut oil boo
3514 2018-01-11 17:50:01 Demand for oil will continue to be high for a some time, but demand for oilsands oil will be weak and will always be among the last purchased. Alberta's oil patch has got to thinking that the boom of the past few years was normal, rather than the exception.
3515 2018-01-11 17:49:53 my tupperware failed me and so now i'm condemned to leave traces of garlic oil everywhere i go
3516 2018-01-11 17:49:53 Never heardof this oil!!
3517 2018-01-11 17:49:41 Not even close to the stated purpose, just a side benefit of low oil prices

3519 2018-01-11 17:49:37 I scream with glee when my breaded fish hits heated vegetable oil to fry up.
3520 2018-01-11 17:49:19 They should turn off the lights to save energy. We can protest the oil and gas companies by having a motorcade.
3521 2018-01-11 17:49:11 We need a couple of gallons of Holy Annointing oil over all the doors of LU.
3522 2018-01-11 17:49:03 I've been saying it for a long time. And what about the massive subsidises that oil companies receive every year?
3523 2018-01-11 17:49:02 Do ever just crave vegetables? Like throw them in a pan with a bit of oil and maybe some chicken?? I just...I want good healthy food lately.

3531 2018-01-11 17:47:57 I like to make fat bombs with coconut oil, almond butter, butter, and 85% cacao.

I put those in my coffee. 
3532 2018-01-11 17:47:41 Even hotter take: anyone lauding her at all sticks in my craw. She’s a vapid agony aunt who’s made a career largely by selling bullshit & dangerous pseudoscience. She’s a snake oil salesman who oughted to be vilified.
3533 2018-01-11 17:47:34 Likely the best thing for his season. If he has a good showing in Australia it helps moving forward & if he doesn't, he'll know exactly where he sits.

3536 2018-01-11 17:47:12 Oregons coast and Washington coast are as important as Florida. There are pristine beaches and salmon and crab clams on the beaches people harvest for food. We dont need no damn oil rigs in our ocean.
3537 2018-01-11 17:47:10 if you ever want to scare me, just pour oil into a pan and turn the stove on high

3542 2018-01-11 17:47:00 What's the tax percentage levied on oil?
3543 2018-01-11 17:47:00 I try not to buy anything with palm oil in it, but it’s very difficult

3545 2018-01-11 17:46:43 Three  things, when you add the marinated chicken you should fry for at least 5-10 minutes till caramelisation develops on meat. Oil means mustard oil - nothing else will do. 3 when I say add water - I mean BOILING water. Chilli-turmeric paste is 4:1 chilli to turmeric mixed with
3546 2018-01-11 17:46:41 So Trump wants to open off shore oil drilling on along all U.S. coastlines except Florida. Hmmmm why Florida of all states. Oh I know Mar-A-Lago is in Florida silly me.
3547 2018-01-11 17:46:40 Allow the bio oil tweet
3548 2018-01-11 17:46:39 With respect to what your saying. You need to know one thing, the US governments of past and present is obsessed with power and domination, where there’s oil/opportunity it will do whatever it can to exploit to control, if not able to exploit then it will create unrest.
3549 2018-01-11 17:46:38 Is the snake oil the beating of ISIS or the surging economy or the low black unemployment rate or the new flexibility by North Korea. Which one of those things offends you?
3550 2018-01-11 17:46:35 I’ve been putting coconut oil on my eyelashes everyday and they’re getting longer 
3551 2018-01-11 17:46:12 this tweet should bang like my bio oil one 
3552 2018-01-11 17:45:59 No, I want clean drinking water, don't you? I don't want nerve gas sprayed on my vegetables, do you? I don't want elephant tusk brought into the US, do you? I want protection for whales & sea turtles, do you? Regulations for oil & gas royalties ......
3553 2018-01-11 17:45:56 You gotta start double cleansing with cleansing oils. Castor oil works great
3554 2018-01-11 17:45:55 3/ Finally, without an independent vetting of efficacy, how do we avoid snake oil? Docs, patients and "the market" won't get it right, because companies will make unverified claims...

3556 2018-01-11 17:45:48 Maybe I'll try the tarte oil. Last week, I had asked an Ulta person about it and she thought it would be too heavy, so I bought a Jouer oil instead. Darn.
3557 2018-01-11 17:45:33 Love #insidepolitics. Don't forget, Mar-a-Lago doesn't want a view with oil rigs. #TakeAmericaBackAgain
3558 2018-01-11 17:45:31 Dems didn't kill jobs, the simple fact that The Free Market™ saw that living off the power grid (solar) AND the lower cost of oil and fracking is what killed coal mining.

Welfare is coal miners expecting the government to take care of their black lung problems. Get another job.
3559 2018-01-11 17:45:26 We experienced global economic growth in 2017. Here are some of the reasons why, according to Dr. Marci Rossell: Europe saw growth due to Brexit, the price of oil has stabilized for producing & consuming countries and the influx of refugees contributing to European job force

3565 2018-01-11 17:44:58 This is method 1. Method 2. Marinate chicken as above. Heat oil add jeera. When splutters add chopped Desi tomato. Cook till mushed. Then add the chilli-haldipaste. Fry. The. Add chicken, fry. The add water & cooked potato & cook till done. Before serving add dollop of good ghee
3566 2018-01-11 17:44:58 @realDonaldTrump please DO NOT approve the letter from Governor Henry McMaster of SC to stop off-shore exploration for drilling. WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR OPTIONS and eventually become self sufficient as a nation w oil!!!!
3567 2018-01-11 17:44:57 Discount Iran’s behavior? What’s Iran done? If anything Iran has been getting bullied by the west solely because it won’t allow the West (mainly America) to dictate or control its oil/gas production. It’s faced decades of sanctions which has led to their financial struggles today
3568 2018-01-11 17:44:54 Extremely rash to follow a shoddy snake oil salesman like Farage.

3571 2018-01-11 17:44:45 I wonder how Trump would feel if we put an oil Derrick off the coast of Mar-a-Lago.
3572 2018-01-11 17:44:41 I really can't think of a better place to find yourself in to wash oil off yourself.
3573 2018-01-11 17:44:35 holy oil tbh
3574 2018-01-11 17:44:32 What happens when the judge rules that NYC does not have to use big oil's products? Or if big oil files an injunction against NYC to cease and desist from using their products as a measure to cut liability?
3575 2018-01-11 17:44:25 Oddly still better than the candidate who got points for saying he was against the Iraq war (even though he wasn’t until 2006, when most people also had turned against it) until he revealed the problem was that we didn’t steal their oil.
3576 2018-01-11 17:44:24 Good luck with that. Big oil will not allow these flood gates to open.
3577 2018-01-11 17:44:13 That's tragic! The world has... more oil and gas?? Oh, never mind...

3581 2018-01-11 17:43:52 Because when the oil money pisses off, City will be left with a wage bill they can’t afford and an empty stadium full of uneaten pies.
3582 2018-01-11 17:43:47 That's a fair comment, I'll agree. But you have to admit that there's bigger economic decisions that was based on than simply AB mini budget. 
Global oil prices clearly have more impact than you're allowing.

3584 2018-01-11 17:43:37 Wasn't the PC's. It was the CPC. Yet you are objecting to OPEC failing to use their monopoly to keep oil prices high. OPEC tried to keep prices high, undermined in the 70's by North Sea Oil, in the 10's by fracking technology.

3590 2018-01-11 17:43:09 Just a thought for those who use the label "dirty oil" in reference to synthetic crude produced from Canada's oil sands. 
There is no such thing as "clean oil". 1/2
3591 2018-01-11 17:43:05 Gold i still think the short game is on. Not broken through high enough levels like oil has

3616 2018-01-11 17:40:51 Oil prices now approaching $65/barrel.  Traded as low as $26/barrel in early 2016.  If gains continue, very strong possibility 2018 income tax savings for middle income consumers will get wiped out by higher fuel prices.

3624 2018-01-11 17:40:09 But higher interest rates could have varying effects on oil E&P, depending on the type/play... As for shale, I am more skeptical than most; I think we're at saturation in some plays and will see more lateral interference, discouraging investment.
3625 2018-01-11 17:39:55 In NJ his property wouldn't be affected by an oil spill - it's too far inland.  Don't know about CA...
3626 2018-01-11 17:39:50 The oil that makes it spreadable is lighter than the other stuff, so over time rises, leaving the remaining stuff - unspreadable - at the bottom 
3627 2018-01-11 17:39:50 น่ากอดจังเลย
3628 2018-01-11 17:39:34 Then why didn't oil go up in 2014?

3631 2018-01-11 17:39:14 @crewatlanta @CoreNetATL economic forecast: 2017 oil prices settled to a level the whole world can live with - $50/Barrel range.

3636 2018-01-11 17:38:31 I’ve lived around the Gulf. No it’s not “fine”, people have died and local businesses lost billions because the national lobbying power of foreign oil companies. The Georgia Coast is extremely preserved and needs its wetlands to protect from hurricanes. We don’t want the Gulf.
3637 2018-01-11 17:38:24 yeah i was trying to find a pen and a oil connect

3639 2018-01-11 17:38:10 The UK has gone really crazy right-wing, but she's no huge climate protagonist. oil plays a big role in Norway's economy and we have climate change deniers in government. We're not too far ahead, alas.
3640 2018-01-11 17:38:02 fucktard they aren't wind mills. T Boone Pickens replaced a lot of his 'oil pumpin machines' with 'wind mills'.
3641 2018-01-11 17:38:01 NYC needs to chill out!!!  They want to increase taxes on the rich, sue oil companies after consuming excessive oil to heat their buildings.  We don't want to be known as the Rotten Apple again or the next Detroit #NYC #deBlasio
3642 2018-01-11 17:37:57 For once I agree. So stop subsidizing big oil and gas, pharmaceuticals and big banks!

3646 2018-01-11 17:37:26 Correct, and he has proven it over and over again (State Pension for useless family members, huge estate tax cut, oil deals, 100 days golfing etc.). But what worries me most is that the GOP is completely blind and approves all that crap. Either they are in it or not smart enough.
3647 2018-01-11 17:37:17 This administration and the GOP historically has a terrible record supporting vets with anything but lip-service.  You know who they support REALLY well?  Oil companies and banks.  Those guys never sleep in the cold.
3648 2018-01-11 17:37:16 yes but they have the underlying commodity to deliver if necessary.  I'm not saying oil can't go higher.  I'm just saying that extreme positioning like this tends to end worse for the specs than for the commercials.
3649 2018-01-11 17:37:13 Interesting! The Arctic kelp bed I work on has no urchins (weird) and is located next to the largest oil field in North America. Looking forward to reading the paper!
3650 2018-01-11 17:37:12 Basically a counter-narrative to the one that says equities have made such a run because interest rates have been so low that it drove more speculative capital into equities (and out of the oil patch).
3651 2018-01-11 17:36:56 Kulang nalang bag na may dalang efficassent oil, certified tita na hahaha
3652 2018-01-11 17:36:53 It does need to be studied and taken seriously. CBD oil is pretty available OTC when made from hemp, it has the tiniest trace of THC. But my understanding is that the CBD/THC combo is demonstrably effective. I'm waiting for my MMC in Illinois it takes 3-4 months after application
3653 2018-01-11 17:36:33 Oil reached 70$ a barrel ...the highest in 3 years

3660 2018-01-11 17:36:16 I'm not knowledgeable in matters crude exploration, but won't the Total crude oil exploration in L. Albert affect the ecosystem?

3706 2018-01-11 17:32:19 One question: not sure if I totally get your interest rate point (wouldn't more money in oil patch be bearish?). 

Higher interest rates would mean higher breakevens (all else equal), but not making the connection with your rotation point away from equities.

3714 2018-01-11 17:31:23 Lol yeah. Keep at it with the oil changes.
3715 2018-01-11 17:31:17 Where is my peppermint oil?

3720 2018-01-11 17:30:57 I can say this, both sides are wrong, Hillary wants more wars in the middle east for corporate oil. Trump wants to attack North Korea so he can compare tiny penises with its leader. This shit has got to stop, come together and protect America from Corporate domination/annihilate
3721 2018-01-11 17:30:53 Trump doesn't give a damn aout the people of Iran . He and the US wants their oil !
3722 2018-01-11 17:30:52 Hold up, gas bulls: "A $3 natgas price on the back of the most bullish storage number ever is hardly a positive signal," Bernstein's narket watcher Alex Leung says. Worse, $60-plus oil encourages Permian oil drilling which makes for more... associated natural gas, Leung says.
3723 2018-01-11 17:30:51 finna go back to sleep til like 2 them go get this oil change
3724 2018-01-11 17:30:48 So it's ok to dump barges of waste offshore but it's not ok to drill for oil, put people to work and improve the country's energy infrastructure?
3725 2018-01-11 17:30:44 Oooo! Dat Fosters Oil Can!
3726 2018-01-11 17:30:41 Mar-A-Lago.

3728 2018-01-11 17:30:29 Yeah thats right. He's the guy that gets paid to be a homer. I respect that.  Lucky bastard! 
3729 2018-01-11 17:30:26 I’m getting my oil changed and the mechanics keep trying to get me to let them “fix” stuff and buy extra things and I’m getting overwhelmed.. where is carson when I need him
3730 2018-01-11 17:30:20 I’ve been using the 2% salicylic acid, 100% cold-pressed Virgin Marula oil and the 100% organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil for 3 days from The ordinary @deciem and it has already transformed my skin. I am in love with this brand!

3732 2018-01-11 17:30:00 Same reason the Canadians colluded with our elections: Running a Canadian oil pipe through Standing Rock is ok.
3733 2018-01-11 17:29:58 Seems like "are the major oils co's' heavily levered to the price of oil?" might be a good oil analyst question @HalftimeReport.?  I think Josh on the whole is wrong
3734 2018-01-11 17:29:52 OPEC finally learnt , what to feed to Oil algos, Pity common gas consumers .
3735 2018-01-11 17:29:39 I am going with... paying them off with heroin-laced pesos, & Saudi oil covered money. 
People have been too ignorant for too long!!

3737 2018-01-11 17:29:33 Tell you what. We'll produce all our own oil; you produce all your own food. CA produces a disproportionate amount of the country's food, and a great deal of our fuel consumption goes towards that. And it's lot libs VS cons. We're all in this together.
3738 2018-01-11 17:29:11 2017 Mex imported from US 18,624 million USD, but exported 24,070. Biggest deficit for the US in all the history of commerce between our two countries.

3739 2018-01-11 17:29:09 Guys on TV all about oil.  Where were they a month ago?  $USO #Chasing
3740 2018-01-11 17:28:56 I think the Oilers do have a blogger. Chris Wescott?
3741 2018-01-11 17:28:49 Do you support fracked LNG in Tacoma ?
Are you buying-in  to PSE’s rhetoric that LNG (fracked)is a cleaner solution to bunker oil?
3742 2018-01-11 17:28:17 They are selling 2 years in a row, oil is up 2 years in a row, not sure they so Smart
3743 2018-01-11 17:27:56 I’m really ready to release the Essential Oil Safety blog this weekend. There are a lot of horrible brands out there who are selling you toxic oils. Also, pure oils are still dangerous to humans and PETS if you are not using them properly.
3744 2018-01-11 17:27:55 Yes please do so. Ppl think will oil drilling will bring in money; however cleaning up spills and leaks will be costly and most of all negatively affect the environment.
3745 2018-01-11 17:27:46 Preacher man why do you indulge in with strange women? You cannot mix oil with water, this will eventually cause you much grief.
3746 2018-01-11 17:27:45 Just a wee bit of olive oil to stop the pasta from sticking
3747 2018-01-11 17:27:38 Guzzling down a bottle of olive oil will most certainly leave you feeling full, fatter and there's a chance you might poop yourself or puke. Not good!

When consumed as prescribed, though, olive oil is actually good. "There are a number of cardiometabolic health benefits .
3748 2018-01-11 17:27:38 I love robotic oil poffins~!
3749 2018-01-11 17:27:32 Do you support fracked LNG in Tacoma ?
Are you buying-in  to PSE’s rhetoric that LNG (fracked)is a cleaner solution to bunker oil?
3750 2018-01-11 17:27:31 BIG O IS A BULL SHIT SNAKE OIL SALESMAN  AND HAS MADE HER FORTUNE ON STUPID WHITE PEOPLE, SHE HAS RUNS A RELIGIOUS "CULT" ALSO
3751 2018-01-11 17:27:30 Instead of focusing on regulating, we just need the proper incentive for cooperation. People underestimate inversion. For example, instead of fighting oil rigs, we need to focus on creating cheap solar energy market with efficient distribution.
3752 2018-01-11 17:27:21 @CarisaMarie11 So I see you stole my patented oil rubbed bronze side table idea, huh??? 
3753 2018-01-11 17:27:21 Who wants to buy me a new tire and pay for my oil change 
3754 2018-01-11 17:27:09 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
3755 2018-01-11 17:26:55 What olive oil you using for cooking lol. Yer some lassie 
3756 2018-01-11 17:26:41 Was in full agreement with you 
3757 2018-01-11 17:26:35 I fell asleep with Tea Tree Oil face wash on and my my face is red AF
3758 2018-01-11 17:26:35 He is the one that doesn’t want to support bills because they are not mean enough and now is complaining about the lack of sympathy towards him? I wish him well but I’m way more concerned about healthcare,Daca,the oil drill that they want to do in The USA and our dictator wannabe
3759 2018-01-11 17:26:33 Did you make some eccentric bet over Martinis with a wealthy, but resolutely reclusive person of means, over the price of oil?
3760 2018-01-11 17:26:28 I just had to go to autozone to get someone to unscrew my oil cap  it’s only in these moments where I need a guy in my life 
3761 2018-01-11 17:26:27 We'll see. US cracked oil was the biggest game changer and I don't see the drills stopping.
3762 2018-01-11 17:26:23 We understand your concerns - rest assured that we only use RSPO certified sustainable oil in our snacks, though!
3763 2018-01-11 17:26:20 Simple economics. What's more valuable to Florida? Oil or Tourism?

3765 2018-01-11 17:26:08 Slosson Hemp is the best CBD oil brand ever. Moderately priced and they have every type of edibles you could ever want. Plus it’s a small, family owned business.
3766 2018-01-11 17:26:07 Anyway I think @CashErrthing was asking me where to buy the alt coins.. I used cryptonator.. I used the bitcoin to the value of $500 from my wallet to purchase that..
3767 2018-01-11 17:25:59 Thats my point. He's pretty good at being impartial.  Stauffer is an employee of the Oilers though. In other markets there are guys like him that only say what the team wants them to say
3768 2018-01-11 17:25:56 Sweeet, blending with strawberries with butter and coconut oil with the coffee really  taste so good -v-
3769 2018-01-11 17:25:53 nor for me
3770 2018-01-11 17:25:45 We're open and have a huge stock of amazing products! Some new and some restock of your favorites! Hood Oil now $25 as well!
3771 2018-01-11 17:25:32 One day I’ll learn how to drizzle. In the meantime I’m pouring litres of oil over stuff because I’m a slavish adherent to recipes and the backs of pizza boxes. #FML
3772 2018-01-11 17:25:31 @kaptainsunshine Building business with you will be my pleasure. Sharing ideas @RoyaldiamondLtd oil % gas• marketing • transpotertation etc
3773 2018-01-11 17:25:28 I can tell you that isn't the case from my neck of the woods and pretty sure the same holds true for the other two mentioned.
3774 2018-01-11 17:25:21 Ok America, it's NIMBY time! (That's what Trump did in FLA so his precious wkly golf game wouldn't be sullied by oil damage)
3775 2018-01-11 17:25:08 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
3776 2018-01-11 17:25:08 What is happening right now regarding the Sanchi oil tanker in the East China Sea and more importantly how will it impact people & wildlife in #Okinawa and other islands in the region? @SubhankarBan @FoEJapan_en @akahata_PR @JapanFocus @okinawatimes @ryukyushimpo

3779 2018-01-11 17:24:57 If oil is hitting $70 a barrel you bet, with the garbage in the ME our oil field Patriots will do what they can to help America's independence from depending on deadbeat oil exploitation stewards.
3780 2018-01-11 17:24:55 U.S. markets rally intraday on positive economic data and gains in commodities, with Brent crude oil reaching a 3-year high above $70. #lwlive
3781 2018-01-11 17:24:51 Oil is creeping higher on Trump's NeoCon collapse, because then MbS go bye-bye/civil war in KSA.
3782 2018-01-11 17:24:49 Warm olive oil helps me..
3783 2018-01-11 17:24:46 Only used the Crown fastflow range, which looks and feels like an oil.. i'm trying to drop all oil for interior work because it just stinks to much.. i can't tolerate it anymore.  Not had the chance to try others yet.
3784 2018-01-11 17:24:23 No reason for it, except @realDonaldTrump ‘s buddies making money. Oil is plentiful.
3785 2018-01-11 17:24:21 I think this decision is as much political as financial. I think CBs are buying oil futures now to attempt to get their inflation targets.
3786 2018-01-11 17:24:17 Try Tea Tree oil.
3787 2018-01-11 17:24:15 @Gormogons 
GP: I see NYC is divesting from oil company stocks. I'm assuming it's a pension fund Deblasio is talking about? Isn't there a fiduciary duty to seek best returns?
3788 2018-01-11 17:24:08 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
3789 2018-01-11 17:24:07 Believe me I’m a doctor last night had lowered cholesterol with coconut oil. Wouldn’t taste right on toast though!
3790 2018-01-11 17:24:04 Real game changer would be oil cartridges in the shape of juul pods. #JustWhatIBeThinking
3791 2018-01-11 17:24:01 Hi Kerri, our yoghurt coated bars are the only bars that do contain a small amount of Palm Kernel Oil. We do also ensure that the Palm Oil we use is derived from an certified source and the suppliers we use are all members of the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil.
3792 2018-01-11 17:23:59 FCX has little correlation with oil. Copper rose in Dec - and $FCX exploded higher - but copper topped out Dec 28 and has been grinding lower since.  Clear $FCX resistance at $20, should test $17.50
3793 2018-01-11 17:23:51 No! You scored some of that? I'm jealous! I did grab a pour of that new stout out of the Quaker State, stuff poured like pure motor oil--so dark and incredibly viscous.
3794 2018-01-11 17:23:45 Never understood the Stauffer towing the company angle line. Obviously, there are things he is not at liberty to talk about openly but Bob says more than most who are actually paid by teams...no matter the sport.
3795 2018-01-11 17:23:44 NYC sues oil companies citing global warming. In Canada we enable oil companies by allowing new pipelines. @ec_minister @JustinTrudeau
3796 2018-01-11 17:23:44 Free Market.  Don't want Americans to buy your oil?  Stop selling it.

3799 2018-01-11 17:23:27 Ooh now I actually found this stock couple days before sandro plan and got in early and made money but then gave all those profits back in WMT - but I like CVX for the year as OIL is higher - profits have to be higher
3800 2018-01-11 17:23:13 Buddy you gotta get the frozen Sun Ramen kits. Tantanmen with some chili oil, chopped peanuts and cilantro, that shit is gold.
3801 2018-01-11 17:23:12 夢ボスゴドラ（いらない)
3802 2018-01-11 17:23:09 How can you start legal action against oil companies while still consuming so much in your city? When NYC or any other liberal mayor no longer consumes oil products then you may have a reason to take legal action.
3803 2018-01-11 17:22:55 Wait...this schmuck wants to give private corps or other countries the rights to US oil and, in doing so, expose 6he US coastlines to danger with no recourse if something goes wrong? Did I misunderstand?
3804 2018-01-11 17:22:46 Let just put a stop to the idea that we even need offshore drilling. We are fast moving to alternate sources. We have plenty of natural gas and current fracking sources. More oil than we need. But sun is abundant. Battery power works.
3805 2018-01-11 17:22:46 My friend showed her drawing to my Spanish teacher and my Spanish teacher made the most disgusted face before answering, "What is that?" 
3806 2018-01-11 17:22:40 The world's noisiest canola oil sent into space
3807 2018-01-11 17:22:38 Thanks to my mom for that great oil rub massage at my shoulder n lower back.
3808 2018-01-11 17:22:35 But are any of those propaganda subsidized by the Oilers? That's what i meant. :)
3809 2018-01-11 17:22:31 I just need my body rubbed down with oil when I get off 
3810 2018-01-11 17:22:22 Enjoy this warm day at WATERWORKS with a WASH & DETAIL!  Check your mileage too.  It's probably time for an OIL CHANGE.  Maintain your vehicle!

3814 2018-01-11 17:22:01 Someone told me that #essentialoils could cure my #diabetes. I have type one diabetes. There is no cure. I am 100% forever and ever amen dependent upon insulin. No amount of oil is going to cure my disease. You don’t know what you’re talking about and you’re pissing me off.
3815 2018-01-11 17:21:59 I'll let you know how it goes. 1 thing many ppl said is to not wear it with a silicone based primer because water foundation. I also didn't apply face oil today. Coverage is decent, applies better 4 me with dry beauty blender
3816 2018-01-11 17:21:56 Don't want that dirty old oil from my state going in any Florida vehicles...!
3817 2018-01-11 17:21:50 *drawing the earth in Spanish class*

3818 2018-01-11 17:21:43 Life can stop playing me now.

*Dabs coconut oil on it*
3819 2018-01-11 17:21:41 Why in the world would the oil companies Subject themselves to further lawsuits by operating in NY. It's what Healthcare providers, P&C Insurers, etc. have done so why not big oil?
3820 2018-01-11 17:21:29 How big does a canola get? Is its oil easier to extract than other healthy oils?
3821 2018-01-11 17:21:27 @thebiodcompany Do you use palm oil or derivatives? I can't see anything about palm oil on your website. Many Thanks!
3822 2018-01-11 17:21:22 i love how my hair looks and feels after i do a hot oil treatment 
3823 2018-01-11 17:21:08 Oilersnation pays its writers, thehockeywriters offers compensation too. I think hockeybuzz pays out too. 

But those are simply a handful off the top of my head.
3824 2018-01-11 17:21:08 i use coconut oil thanks
3825 2018-01-11 17:21:06 Taking your makeup off is not just using a Neutrogena wipe. You still have to cleanse, tone, and moisturize right after. That is taking off your makeup! Don't take off the makeup and leave the oil/dirt.
3826 2018-01-11 17:21:04 Will be on @KSCOAM1080 at 6:45 AM on Monday, 1/15, to discuss offshore oil and marine sanctuaries.
3827 2018-01-11 17:20:49 Applaud him on that. That's some good work. But has he done anything for the palm oil or cocoa farmer? If he has, please enlighten me. If not, any plans?
3828 2018-01-11 17:20:48 he seems to enjoying it...anyway as a gift during the holidays i had got him $500 worth of Byte coins..I think the price was around 0.005 when I bought it ..looks like it is at 0,01 today.. he seems to be thrilled:)
3829 2018-01-11 17:20:44 Also, try rose hip oil and exfoliating
3830 2018-01-11 17:20:33 The rise in oil price is the only explanation I have for the incredible rally on NSE this year!
3831 2018-01-11 17:20:14 MCT is for energy (and explosive diarrhea). You can get many of the same benefits w/o the  with coconut oil. Google it. Or try powdered MCT oil if you need the energy it provides. I hear Perfect Keto makes a good one

3833 2018-01-11 17:20:06 Prevost was traded to the Oil Barons?!
3834 2018-01-11 17:19:52 Is that oil or water coming from the car?
3835 2018-01-11 17:19:51 Crimea....oil...Exxon..and lots of Russian money
3836 2018-01-11 17:19:49 .@Reuters Russia exports oil, gas & weapons. In mid-2014, 25% of her economy & 50% of her government revenues came from oil/gas.
3837 2018-01-11 17:19:46 これはっ…………元後輩のふじたさんか？？線が似てる気がするっ！
3838 2018-01-11 17:19:42 Because Gov. Scott is running for Senate against a Dem who is against oil drilling so he will say he is against oil drilling until elected to Senate then surprise, Sen. Scott  will be totally for oil drilling off the coast.  Don't be fooled.
3839 2018-01-11 17:19:30 What bothers me about this paper is how it blames oil prices.
The price of a barrel is lower than it was ten years ago, sure, but it's in fact higher today (adjusted for inflation) than it was for 20 years beginning in the mid 80's, when the industry was supposedly booming
3840 2018-01-11 17:19:27 はえ～
3841 2018-01-11 17:19:26 Oil flying, I’m holding long on #SAVP #ELA #SDX #HUR. Small trades in #CHAR and #PMG.  Largest holding #UOG - big things about to happen here.
3842 2018-01-11 17:19:22 That lil oil that be on girls face i like that over makeup ... girls be light skin from the chin up den darker than 11:42 after the makeup come off I’m str8

3844 2018-01-11 17:19:09 We are one of the cleanest countries in the world without clean energy. Now I'm an all of the above for energy. Used to fish by oil rigs. There is no pollution.
3845 2018-01-11 17:19:04 Just sell your groundnut oil and go
3846 2018-01-11 17:18:48 No offshore oil drilling off of the coast of Connecticut!#USA
3847 2018-01-11 17:18:40 When i get an oil change and i hear the guy drive it and burn the shit out of my clutch
3848 2018-01-11 17:18:38 Just got my oil changed in less than 15 min.. it’s gonna be a great day.
3849 2018-01-11 17:18:34 Right you are and again in the early 1990s. But big oil was able to kill them both times. Only Musk’s own money and believers kept it alive against big oil and big auto. Look at all the negative comments about share price etc. He is still under attack.
3850 2018-01-11 17:18:26 マジやんけ……
3851 2018-01-11 17:18:24 You do know Canada has the cleanest oil in the world right? Look in your own backyard.
3852 2018-01-11 17:18:22 It wasn't until u were all lubed up with oil that I realized (and everyone else) that u stay really fit! Challenge comeback or bust @EmFitMTV
3853 2018-01-11 17:18:12 I'd like to know, is there a way to get paid to write good shit about the #Oilers? If there is, sign me up. :) The closest to that job would be Stauffer, but he's pretty good at not always towing the company line. I like Stauffer.

3855 2018-01-11 17:17:59 Love risk ignoring energy prices, not good for Walmart or $AMZN customers when oil goes from 50 to 70
3856 2018-01-11 17:17:58 Oil prices, which rose on Wednesday after the U.S. reported a 4.9 mmbbl decline in crude inventories, could reach $80 a barrel due to some geopolitical risks that have not abated, such as tension in the Middle East, Donald Trump and the potential for global oil supply disruptions

Oil and gas revenues generated from FN “territory” yet so many don’t have safe drinking water.  So, yeah we are perpetuating.  And important to hold the govt of the day to account.

3884 2018-01-11 17:14:59 It's unlikely Kenyan fuel prices will go below KES 100/- (super) for a while as oil prices hit $70 per barrel for the first time since 2014.
3885 2018-01-11 17:14:55 I'm also interested in the advantages of cooking with coconut oil, especially the popular version with the taste of coconut removed. It has a higher smoking point, which, has advantages in cooking. Also heat and toxicity, some oils are supposed to become toxic when heated.

3888 2018-01-11 17:14:30 "Environmental position" for decades is "no offshore drilling"; we are still linked to a pipeline of engineering jobs for the rigs, and the lack of the US to achieve "energy independence" from big oil. Go solar, wind, and hydroelectric energy! Julie Ann Racino, ASPA, 2018

3993 2018-01-11 17:05:21 Lol, it depends what you're after. Russell is the perfect example. He was a good signing last yr but not worth a 4-yr extension. Hainsey was signed two years & been pretty good for half a season so far. Far less risk. Not all situations are the same.

4012 2018-01-11 17:04:02 Aren’t oil rigs generally far enough off shore you can’t see them from the beach?
4013 2018-01-11 17:03:54 There is most likely a ton of shorts coming into oil/crude plays. That could be the fuel to rocket it into 80-90 range. Would be a fantastic bear trap imo. Just a thought
4014 2018-01-11 17:03:53 thanks love!!!! I did get the fresh brand rose deep hydration face cream! and i got the sunday riley’s UFO ultra clarifying face oil, and a serum spray, and a toner and facial cleanser i’m excited for!!! i’ll post a pic when i get it (hopefully soon since i’m in Germany lol)
4015 2018-01-11 17:03:50 I grew up by the Gulf of Mexico. It’s beautiful, and has thousands of oil rigs. Nobody there complains about them. You don’t bite the hand that feeds you.
4016 2018-01-11 17:03:46 Sure, he also had a hand getting out of LA too. The way I see it with him is that he's at the VERY end of his career and he's playing for a contract every year. You'd hope he isn't the same guy that would take a comment like that public again at this point though.

4025 2018-01-11 17:03:10 Russia could built new oil benchmark, but due to misorganization and laziness is far from setting it up. In fact, ESPO futures (not deliverable) are traded on ICE. Urals is only name, zero liquidity
4026 2018-01-11 17:03:05 India's IOC buys U.S. Light Louisiana Sweet oil via tender: NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's top refiner Indian Oil Corp has bought 2 million barrels of U.S. Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) crude via a tender for April delivery, its head of finance A. K. Sharma said on Thursday.
4027 2018-01-11 17:02:57 WTI oil +$0.30 at $63.87/barrel buoyed by a surprise decline in U.S. production and lower U.S. inventories. Exxon and Chevron shares rise.

When the rubber hits the road, we will see how many of you use black salve, apricot pits and cannabis oil for your child's cancer.
4035 2018-01-11 17:02:12 I use a face oil from the body shop that works quite well for me. Have you ever tried an actual oil or ‚just‘ oily creams? The water in cream can evaporate or freeze and that’s not super good for your skin, especially in those cold months.
4036 2018-01-11 17:02:02 You've all heard the news about Trump now wanting an oil rig off the coast of Florida to inhibit the pristine view of resort goers. Fight back on your coastline! That is a one-man band move of maniacal behavior.

When thinking about Nigeria & out dependence on oil remember this

4046 2018-01-11 17:01:36 Let me go for this oil change
4047 2018-01-11 17:01:14 ALERT. Several years ago I walked on the beach near Santa Barbara wearing my Crocs. When I got back to my car & took off my Crocs, I saw they had absorbed large amounts of oil from off shore drilling rigs. We must NEVER allow this to happen again. NEVER NEVER
4048 2018-01-11 17:01:09 Get peppermint oil! I used to get headaches all the time, but it works!
4049 2018-01-11 17:01:00 Just want to put this out there. Long term we are on the start of a primary cycle bull run. We will see oil at $120 again within next 2-3 years #oil
4050 2018-01-11 17:00:59 Cube mate brought in an essential oil diffuser. Put in the peppermint smelling one. Now our cube smells like rumpleminze.
4051 2018-01-11 17:00:57 I have bad Asthma too, and it sucks to be like this. Try drinking hot/warm water w/ honey. If you have Eucalyptus oil, put it in a towel and breathe it in. Last resort I take a hot shower because steam helps my bad congestion.
4052 2018-01-11 17:00:53 Yep, we are all busy producing your food, oil, and paying California taxes...

4055 2018-01-11 17:00:37 The Koch's money came from their Daddy selling Stalin oil equipment and developing Russian oil.
4056 2018-01-11 17:00:33 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.

4058 2018-01-11 17:00:25 I started using tea tree oil on my skIn a couple weeks ago and I don’t remember the last time it looked this good
4059 2018-01-11 17:00:12 Get it through your head the economy is great because of President Obama. Not because of you. And nothing in the world you can do can change that. in 4 years will have a recession oil spills polluted water that will be your legacy
4060 2018-01-11 17:00:12 Yeah girl it is. I used to use boscia but since the MK idk what it did girl like the blackheads, excess oil, smooth. I quite recommend it. Or if you’ll like to try it before buying it lmk
4061 2018-01-11 17:00:08 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.
4062 2018-01-11 16:59:58 Of course the day after my dad leaves town my car turns to shit, my oil runs out and my battery is ruined ... happy flipping snow day to me
4063 2018-01-11 16:59:33 Obama had as little to do with pruvate business as he does with the oil price. Again, you knowledge is lacking while trying to call out others who actually know more. His policies made business hold their money. Try looking at home, car sales. Even investing. You may be surprised
4064 2018-01-11 16:59:32 You don’t just jump into bed with Terry Tibbs, you take Terry Tibbs out to lunch, you wine and dine him, you give him an oil massage then he gives you 1950 if you’re lucky!

I am a bit distressed about all the gross fracking taking place in West Texas & allowing thousands of ugly wind turbines. Yuk.

4076 2018-01-11 16:58:38 so let me get this straight - dollar is in the toilet - oil is surging - wmt is raising wages and the locusts at the fed still see no inflation whatsoever .. they really have sht on their face
4077 2018-01-11 16:58:34 Dollar is most transparent and it is reserve currency. China experience in building oil benchmark counts only as as MOCHA Mean of Huangpu assessment for fuel oil. As to my understanding, oil futures benchmark can be created by supplier, not receiver.

4083 2018-01-11 16:57:59 It takes up the entire 5 acre building!! Not reliable, not realistic!! Oil will create energy independence from the rest of the world and will enrich our country with jobs and with technology, it is much safer than in years past! Get over it! Drill baby drill!

4085 2018-01-11 16:57:50 Thank God that when NYC is submerged in the future these ignorant tweets will serve as a historic reminder as to why. Coastal cities are greatly threatened by global warming. Big oil knew about affect on the Earth’s climate in 80s and did nothing. They deserve to be sued.
4086 2018-01-11 16:57:49 Technology changes played a major role in opening up new basins, geographies in past 100 yrs. Q you have to ask? How would oil prices have behaved past 50yrs without Opec cartel? More, or less volatile? #oott
4087 2018-01-11 16:57:35 My analysis shows only one spot where drilling for oil right next to beach would be acceptable to the majority of Americans - right next to Mar-a-Lago.

4118 2018-01-11 16:54:14 Can you imagine what a $1 trillion infrastructure bill will do to the price of oil? Hell, gas jumped $0.15 overnight two nights ago!
4119 2018-01-11 16:54:13 Oil companies vary production to manipulate gasoline and diesel prices. As a result, consumers must budget more funds for transportation and allocate less money for other needs...

4121 2018-01-11 16:54:05 So all of the Governors both DEM & GOP are pissed off that ONLY Florida has the offshore drilling exemption. 

45th is protecting Mar Lago at all cost, but to hell with the other states. Hmmmmm. We can look to N.Dakota on 45ths oil policy record. This EXEMPTION is fishy!!!

4125 2018-01-11 16:53:59 This really stinks.  First, Florida is exempted from offshore oil drilling (Mar-a-lago) and now Trump interviewed candidate for Manhattan US Atty.  The way the Trump and his family personally benefit from the office of POTUS is sickening.
4126 2018-01-11 16:53:49 Alot of what's happened is turning oil glut into now a product glut (notice gasoline stocks are right back at last year's levels).  If cold subsides just a little, distillate going same way.  Market will never see it this way though :(
4127 2018-01-11 16:53:43 As were the players you listed. I'm confused. Are you suggesting the Leafs are enjoying the season they are b/c of the players you listed? If so, it's just not true. The younger players on that team make it go not the vets & as a collective, are better than what Oilers have.
4128 2018-01-11 16:53:42 You certainly won't hear it in england because apparantly you don't exist, despite 'us' lying about oil revenues...how's you Marion? Hope all well xx
4129 2018-01-11 16:53:30 Brent up to $70. Does this mean that the oil market is?

4133 2018-01-11 16:53:26 glossier just sent me an email about their new oil wash (which obvi, i want) and it looks like a lube ad.
4134 2018-01-11 16:53:20 the price  increase of the oil worries me something - bad memories of 2008, at  that time real estate bubble in combination with high oil prices, today  - 10 years later - possible #crypto bubble and high oil prices + high  stock prices can again lead to a crisis
4135 2018-01-11 16:53:16 The link is well established. The world will continue to shift and the demand for oil will drop, especially for the oil types with the highest carbon content. That's reality that Alberta and people in the oil patch have to face.
4136 2018-01-11 16:53:15 European stock indices close with mixed results 10 year bond yields higher.  Gold up. Oil continues run higher.  EUR is the strongest.  USD the weakest. 
The European stock markets are closed and the results are mixed:

4138 2018-01-11 16:53:07 so mayor fruit cake. Whats the cost to the taxpayer for pulling over $5$ billion out of oil stocks?
4139 2018-01-11 16:53:00 Buying oil and gas from Russia is financing #PutinAtWar -> paying for the death and destruction of Russia's army invading Europe in Ukraine.
4140 2018-01-11 16:52:54 Why doesn't he ban the use of oil in NYC? That would solve all of their problems.

4148 2018-01-11 16:52:15 In the oil industry we have a saying “ you have your head up your rear end “
4149 2018-01-11 16:51:55 for 80-90%. In earnest now only 2 people are relevant upon the subject of oil supply: Putin and the Crown Prince of SA.
4150 2018-01-11 16:51:49 Multiple attempts by us at NYC to examine frequent #refrigeration coil cleaning for #energyefficiency with no effect. Shows toleration of unneeded GHG emissions on their part. Suing oil companies is not the way to go.

4154 2018-01-11 16:51:27 WTI crude oil futures are up by 10%+ over the last month & by more than 23% YoY topping mid 2015 levels. Oil price shock on the way so keep an eye on inflation numbers this week. PPI Food was +2.1% Y/Y in December, down 130 basis points from November #AmazonEffectOnFood

4159 2018-01-11 16:50:30 The oil companies should stop selling gas and oil to NYC.

4173 2018-01-11 16:49:24 German 5-year govie yields creeping closer to 0 %, oil hovering near $70 and US retail workers getting wage increases - is this the beginning of the great transition from new normal to slightly more old-fashioned normal?
4174 2018-01-11 16:49:15 Please compare with increase in global crude oil prices... Pump prices of motor fuels are not market driven. Of course, Price rise was kept in check with the run up to Gujarat Assembly Polls which was a political move

4180 2018-01-11 16:48:57 The New Oil World Order, Thursday's edition: In November, France imported more crude oil from the US than from Iran, Libya, Nigeria or the North Sea. The US was the 5th largest source of crude oil imports for France in November.
4181 2018-01-11 16:48:42 The more expensive oil gets, the cheaper renewable energy in comparison. Some even argue that fossil should be extremely expensive.

4183 2018-01-11 16:48:35 What a moron. Oil, coal and NG companies are not the problem, its the consumer. If NYC consumed less these companies would produce more.

The players are the ones that have to play, it's up to them to get results.
4187 2018-01-11 16:48:16 @realDonaldTrump. President Trump, you know we are slaves of Private Federal Reserve. The dollar will collapsed soon. The ranbimbi, will buy Oil from Saudi Arabia. No more dollar as world reserved. You know and I know.

4195 2018-01-11 16:46:49 I should've been more specific, it's not the quantity (even though it is a bit) but also getting the right guys. 

Cammalleri is the oldest player on the roster and I believe one of those right guys. 

The other players you listed are barely 30 if that.
4196 2018-01-11 16:46:47 So, what are you doing to protect Texas’ economy against Trump’s plans to cancel NAFTA? Allowing oil drilling coastal waters? Stop tax $ spent on a ludicrous wall-instead add personnel at actual crossings? Isn’t Hurricane relief a better use of tax $? ? ? ?
4197 2018-01-11 16:46:26 This could be NLs saviour! Smart idea would be to get 8 Frigates and use the rest $$ for logistics. Ships will be crewed by people who live in rural areas (bring $$ to rural), and we would be like pirates, pillaging fishing, cargo, and oil fleets outside 200 mile!

4200 2018-01-11 16:46:12 Took my wife's infiniti FX35 to Infini at Bayside Queens, after charging 1600 for fixing the car. Less than 2 weeks, the car shuts down when you put it in drive. Horrible service @baysideinfiniti now they claim the car had multiple oil leaks.
4201 2018-01-11 16:46:09 I think @Oil_Drop @oil_drop is on to something, we should expect more from the vets we have. However Maroon/Auvitu/Kassian/Talbot/Letestu are all examples of guys that need more personal success time as NHLers before I'd believe in their leadership potential as vets.
4202 2018-01-11 16:46:08 First, Patrick!!!!!!!!!  Second, MCT oil tends to upset my stomach. Tried and tried with it, but I just can't do it.

4204 2018-01-11 16:46:03 Playing car doctor today. I have an oil leak from somewhere other than the pan. I love messing with this car.
4205 2018-01-11 16:46:00 My coconut oil is melted so that means we’re about to have a beautiful day on our hands 
4206 2018-01-11 16:45:44 I would like to see an alternative to oil in the future but would honestly rather keep off shore drilling if it meant net neutrality would come back.
4207 2018-01-11 16:45:33 Sorry for them losing their jobs.  Sorry they trusted Trump & Pence’s bold faced lies. But they fell for what many of us felt is & was not a sustainable promise by our snake oil salesman POTUS & VP.  They should not wait for the lies of the SOTU speech to decide he was a bad vote
4208 2018-01-11 16:45:29 Kansas Aviation's PW100 & PW150 accessory capabilities include fuel to oil heaters and coolers, fuel pumps and flow dividers.
4209 2018-01-11 16:45:29 I guess corporations aren't as altruistic as the #GOP makes them out to be. Perhaps just a little regulation on water quality, oil drilling, coal mining, minimum wage, consumer rights, banking, worker rights/safety, aviation, etc., isn't such a horrible thing?
4210 2018-01-11 16:45:26 All of you Congressmen and women, better wake up and see what the big picture is here.... OIL STATE coming... pretty soon he will change the laws to install himself PERMANATELY... How is the Security going for the EVS?

4219 2018-01-11 16:44:32 @KenPaxtonTX singling out utilities as the ONLY corporations not allowed to benefit from the #TaxCut is the definition of large government over-regulation.  Will you demand grocers use tax windfall reduce food prices?  Oil companies to reduce gas prices? Why stop at utilities?
4220 2018-01-11 16:44:30 ?: Why do broke ppl brag about quitting a job like they sitting on barrels of oil ???
4221 2018-01-11 16:44:27 "U.S. energy policy should encourage investment in oil and gas, not because they already meet most of our energy needs but because they're affordable and reliable and essential for stability in the century ahead."
4222 2018-01-11 16:44:18 First Trump pulled out of the Paris Accord, then commandeered thousands of acres of National Parks for exploration for minerals and oil, now he wants to allow offshore drilling on the East Coast.

4227 2018-01-11 16:43:53 Nice. On causation, I'd note that the system cost of coal/nuke plant outages isn't treated the same way as the purported system cost of variable renewables. E.g., is anyone proposing to add the cost of running oil in a dual-fuel NE ISO generator to the cost of running Pilgrim?

4252 2018-01-11 16:41:58 GS:  investment bank believes the cartel does not want the central banks to start responding to inflationary pressure from oil prices above $70 a barrel. Further, it also fears the US shale investments may rise if prices hold above $70 levels.

4313 2018-01-11 16:35:17 That "wealth" of oil has been around for decades and has helped no one other than the oil companies that own it and the politicians they have bought with it. It is finite and killing our planet.

4406 2018-01-11 16:26:40 Your rational to take FL out of consideration stinks of corruption.  Many are arguing, and you know it is true, that all of the US coastlines are way too beautiful and valuable to subject them to the ugly/dangerous short term greed of the oil and gas industry #listentothepeople

4409 2018-01-11 16:26:35 Better connect hoses to all the equipment trying to clean up oil spills and pump it onto Trump's Mar A Lago (Boloto) property.
4410 2018-01-11 16:26:23 The "excellent things" are a result of the gross Tory mismanagement and negligence of our oil windfall + them locking us into MF. Not defending the Liberals here as much as I am laying blame where it should be appropriately placed. They - and we - were left with a bloody mess.

Oprah is a great business woman but she also gave Jenny McCarthy(believes vaccines cause autism),Dr Oz(pushes snake oil) a platform.

4416 2018-01-11 16:26:10 The jobs in oil are rapidly growing and pay very handsomely. So we'll even Walmart has to pay $17 an hour in places like ND. Trump just approved oil rigs in the Gulf lots of industry surrounding that will have many jobs.
4417 2018-01-11 16:26:10 Scott just lost my vote for Senator.  He apparenly only wants low paying tourist jobs - not high paying oil service jobs.

4420 2018-01-11 16:25:42 I think the lawsuit movement is more fraught. You can't just sue oil companies and pretend that demand for oil, including by people like you who shun convenient alternatives to lower your footprint, is not an issue

4430 2018-01-11 16:24:42 There is probably enough oil from New Jersey hair products  and Chris  Christie floating in the Delaware River that Pennsylvania could just setup a skimmer and be energy independent.
4431 2018-01-11 16:24:34 nope, but oil exports add a new reason for countries to hold dollar reserves- the same as the original petro dollar - to buy oil- but from the United States

4453 2018-01-11 16:22:56 OK. Most projects remain cancelled at $63/bbl oil. Although the reunification of the right which foretells a return to a non socialist government with an appreciation of capital risk will have many international firms considering investment once again.

4458 2018-01-11 16:22:33 HOW CAN WE GET RID OF CLIMATE CHANGE?

The first challenge is eliminating the burning of coal, oil and, natural gas.The easiest way to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions is simply to buy less stuff and to stop cutting down trees Every year, 33 million acres of trees are cut...
4459 2018-01-11 16:22:32 Oil and gas producers should cease doing business in NYC and see how that works out for Warren and his Delusional Progressive Fantasies™

4469 2018-01-11 16:21:29 It’s most definitely because he does not want to see oil rigs off his Mara lago coast. That would be detrimental to his income.

4471 2018-01-11 16:21:06 News flash for liberal idiots. Russia has an oil price dependent economy.
When the US increases oil exploration and drilling, the price of oil goes down.
Trump has acted to increase exploration and drilling. This is not what a preferred Russia candidate would do. They wanted HRC.

4475 2018-01-11 16:20:51 Extortion also. Fraud in their bond sales. "These California cities attempting to make money off oil companies appear to be using the Jesse Jackson/Al Sharpton Shakedown and Extortion approach in which the truth does not matter."
4476 2018-01-11 16:20:35 Certainly got fuel coming through, so presumably not.... not sure what’s changed. Also had major oil leak from filter housing. Have refitted adapter with liquid gasket, and waiting to go off.
4477 2018-01-11 16:20:33 The oil divestment movement is more about virtue signaling than action signaling. "We are forced to drive to Manhattan/San Francisco because oil companies are evil."Exaggerating a bit but there's some truth to this

4479 2018-01-11 16:20:14 Usually I kindly disagree but on this point we are 100% in agreement.  I've seen the oil companies sell older rigs to new investors or leave shadow crew to operate the dry Wells because it's cheaper than removing the rig.  It's the common practice.  Happening in cook inlet Alaska

4485 2018-01-11 16:19:48 Sadly, this is barely a NIMBY issue as much as it about common sense. Why are we talking about oil extraction when we know we could be moving to cleaner forms of energy.  Any energy extraction plans off the Oregon coast should be focused on wave and wind power generation.
4486 2018-01-11 16:19:44 BOI check engine light, an oil leak on the main oil filter housing, and the sensor wasn’t working for my oil. Apparently it’s a common jeep problem & the dealership had them readily in stock

4528 2018-01-11 16:16:38 Army recruitment commercials capitalize on lack of financial security, hyper nationalism, and “free” college education to trap at-risk and unstable people in tours where they either die for oil or are abandoned by the VA when and if they come back.
4529 2018-01-11 16:16:38 No one can reduce Taxes on petrol and diesel as collecting the Tax is very easy volume and quantum is very high , there are no leakages as the Oil Companies are direct control of government they have robust IT systems and pay Tax religiously

4537 2018-01-11 16:16:02 Another successful placement for the team with the appointment of Sales Director for a leading UK fabricator of process equipment for the upstream Oil & Gas industry.
4538 2018-01-11 16:16:01 This kind of PR will scare people and kill investment into bicoin. Medicine man selling snake oil.
4539 2018-01-11 16:16:01 That car looks like it leaks oil and has a tire that goes flat when it sits to long.
4540 2018-01-11 16:15:56 Oil companies just do what’s in their best interest, like all of us. Oil companies comply with regulations, the rest is maximizing profits. Regulations need to cover safe, environmentally responsible production methods, that’s it. The rest is on the consumer.
4541 2018-01-11 16:15:55 ever had a near death experience when you're stuck between letting your house burn down or close the gas valve while the cooker is on fire!!? like hot cooking oil + LPG ball of 

I thank God I'm alive today because He gave me the courage to close that valve.  #Grateful

4544 2018-01-11 16:15:31 The only one that would be very happy to see Trump end the deal and impose sanctions is Putin. Ending the deal changes Iran's position in a way that it would hurt it economically which will keep them from being able to have competitive prices on their oil, which is good for Putin
4545 2018-01-11 16:15:20 お、おう
4546 2018-01-11 16:15:17 #Petrol and #Diesel rates are raising every day now on above rs.-60 meanwhile the #CrudeOil is still on $65 currently.

This is the @BJP4India who protest against @INCIndia when petrol rate is about rs.- 52 and crude oil is $115, @narendramodi ji tell to the Indians about this.
4547 2018-01-11 16:15:17 spent my whole life trying to mattify and use oil control products and now I’m embracing the power of hydration!!!!!
4548 2018-01-11 16:15:08 @Varneyco  perhaps we should give deblasio   
Just what he's asking for. Stop the shipment of ALL oil/gas products to NY
4549 2018-01-11 16:14:46 Theres many habitable planets, aliens have no reason to risk their society, why go to the one thats technologically stuck on oil greed and is obsessed with bombs and revenge
4550 2018-01-11 16:14:43 People that cook with Olive Oil perplex me.
4551 2018-01-11 16:14:42 Sir i am providing bore well drilling service . What is the service code and tax rate.? Can i claim ITC of oil and other   items purchased , which are used in drilling
4552 2018-01-11 16:14:28 NYC mayor sueing oil companies for causing global warming. Is this what the people of NYC elected him to do? 3guesses n first 2 don't count. 
4553 2018-01-11 16:14:27 Dinesh, for a while I couldn't decide if you were an idiot or a snake oil salesmen, but your statements the past few months have proven that these conditions are not mutually exclusive
4554 2018-01-11 16:14:21 $ROK-Strong move tday w/ indstrls higher. Barely any analysts rate stock BUY (17 H, 2 S, 2 BYS); beneficiary of tax reform+capex spend, oil/commdity recovery. $EMR would have paid $230+ in friendly deal. Put buyers today in the FEB '18 line. Maybe sell to someone else?
4555 2018-01-11 16:14:17 Look at the map. #45 has drilling Everything. Oil spill all Over. WHY is he distroying our environment? WHY Money that's not his?
4556 2018-01-11 16:14:16 Petya, that is rubbish. Nuclear was developed to get France off oil, which it never got (it uses more than ever). Nuclear costs are now so high, and efficiency and renewables so low that nuclear has no place any longer. And nuclear is *not* clean. Baseload is a term of the past.
4557 2018-01-11 16:14:15 When you're getting sick, you should take oil of oregano

4560 2018-01-11 16:13:48 Do you get your toes done in gel? Here where I’m from you can get gel nails, and a pedi with hot stones, oil and scrub etc for 40 bucks and they massage your shoulders too lol. I’m from NJ. I haven’t got my nails done in a while. My nails grow really long but I rip them off. Lol
4561 2018-01-11 16:13:43 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump “How about that off our coast oil drilling?”

4566 2018-01-11 16:13:32 True that skilled jobs are disappearing in the oil patch. But increasing in other sectors. BC also has a big shortage of skilled workers. I'm sorry you think I'm callous. I'm not sure what you think the NDP could do in two years, aside from welfare for multinational oil companies
4567 2018-01-11 16:13:24 Love going to get my oil changed early and gettin the feeling that the guys here aren't quite ready to work. Here comes the 'You need a filter' routine. Yes, I realize my filter doesn't look as clean as a brand new one.
4568 2018-01-11 16:13:19 In terms of pockets; oil and gas's are far deeper than coal's. 
As for wind, Trump will forever hate wind power because of his Scotland golf course debacle.

4576 2018-01-11 16:12:45 Little open source information is available about OVL's investments in the Vietnamese offshore oil rig HYSY981. Speculation is that it has generated less than expected economic value and that India continues to pursue it for geostrategic motives. Not sure how much this is true.

4589 2018-01-11 16:11:34 So @NYC is suing the big 5 oil companies for their roll in climate change citing "public nuisance"?

4590 2018-01-11 16:11:28 Other currencies, metals, commodities (remember oil and grains in 2007?) If you remember, Trump actually said he will be doing this. He thinks this is the way to boost economy. He doesn't get currency plays are zero-sum minus opportunity cost and friction.

4596 2018-01-11 16:11:12 Oil just changed the level of development. Arabia under Ottoman rule saw no development or any prospect of it with exception of Makkah and Madinah. They saw it as a backwater unworthy of their resources. Any indigenous rule, whether Saudi or other, would not have the same view.
4597 2018-01-11 16:11:11 older carbureted engines needed to warmup a bit. Fuel injection burns rich to begin with & theory is gasoline gets in around piston rings & breaks down oil. I am a mechanic

4617 2018-01-11 16:09:30 Why don’t want Mara largo affected? Offshore drilling is a disaster and you and everyone else knows it. We have an over abundance of oil so why why
4618 2018-01-11 16:09:25 Shhhhh!!!! Nobody move... *whispers* Look at oil. #IsOilBack #MyColumn
4619 2018-01-11 16:09:14 Oil need to commit to Puljujarvi, and they need to do it now. He's performing well on the McDavid line and is less dynamic on any other line. So, when the coach moves Draisaitl to McDavid line, JP isn't dynamic. There's no playoff race, imo JP should be on McDavid's line

4623 2018-01-11 16:08:20 @SRuhle @AliVelshi Yesterday: The President said that we have oil, and Hillary wanted windmills (mockingly). Within seconds of saying that, he mentioned that Norway has water-power, and how much he liked that, and - literally - "We should look into that." It was gobsmacking.

4626 2018-01-11 16:08:11 “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the butter, flour, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, but they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” 

Let that sink in. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it?
4627 2018-01-11 16:08:07 Trump exempts Florida from coastal oil drilling because he's a buddy with the GOP gov. California? Forget it you didn't vote for me! Drill Baby Drill! The fed government is now a fiefdom that Trump and his lieutenants rule according to their whim- and desire to punish critics.
4628 2018-01-11 16:08:06 i love how good my girl runs after she gets her oil changed and she’s on a full tank of gas, like driving a whole new car 
4629 2018-01-11 16:07:43 All right. Fair enough. I guess it's up for debate whether or not pumping our earth full of chemicals is a good thing for our water supplies. As for earthquakes, some of them aren't minor, people have experienced extensive damage, and the oil companies are off the hook for that.
4630 2018-01-11 16:07:36 I took profit at 48 didnt want leave it
4631 2018-01-11 16:07:36 #PoliticalTrick Cover a lie with a legitimate reason which is not yours. Example: Florida has unique beaches, so it should be exempt from off-shore oil drilling (when their huge delegate count is the real reason, & as if other coastal states are equal but LESS equal than Florida)
4632 2018-01-11 16:07:25 Infinite the type of idols who talk about bitcoins and oil prices 
4633 2018-01-11 16:07:25 Well yes. But demand for oil hasn't kept up with supply. That's why prices are low. GDP isn't the only measure of prosperity. If we increase oil based GDP prosperity and don't count the externalities from climate change we haven't gained anything.
4634 2018-01-11 16:07:25 Lmao like I'm knocking all the way out after I get my back blown out. You'd think I just got off a 12hr shift  on an oil rig the way I be sleep

4639 2018-01-11 16:06:37 We spent more on disaster relief in 2017 than ever before. To make up, Trump eliminated the fund to clean up after oil spills. Oh, and eliminated 2 major safety regs for offshore drilling so #DeepwaterHorizon isn't repeated.

Can you say "cause & effect"?

4650 2018-01-11 16:05:05 This is the reality in Central African Republic:

*The country is rich in diamonds, gold & oil. But it’s one of the poorest in the world.
*1 in 2 people need humanitarian aid.
*Less than 1 in 4 schools are functioning.
*Only 30% of the population has access to clean water.
4651 2018-01-11 16:04:56 Not to mention fault lines! Can u imagine if they hit an unknown one while drilling? Not only potential for underwater earthquake but tsunami AND oil spill!
4652 2018-01-11 16:04:50 Why do old farts do everything in the morning  waiting for a 2 hour oil change

4654 2018-01-11 16:04:35 The campaign of misinformation has been in high gear for the past 2 years. The Emperor is preparing for his grand coronation.

4655 2018-01-11 16:04:34 Trump will protect Florida beaches from oil because it is a Red State. CA not so much! “California is also ‘unique’ & our ‘coasts are heavily reliant on  tourism as an economic driver,’ ” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra tweeted. Trump to CA F--k your beaches liberals!

4665 2018-01-11 16:03:50 Hi, I'd like to order beard oil @PlushLuxury
4666 2018-01-11 16:03:44 Ahí tengo una gran duda histórica ¿Qué tanto pesa el gas oil en la producción ganadera? Es permanente el reclamo de algunos productores que solo tienen un flete y no hacen ni una pradera
4667 2018-01-11 16:03:34 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
4668 2018-01-11 16:03:32 Hey there @TSNBobMcKenzie - Any possible scenario where Pacioretty and RNH are swapped? I would guess MTL send a little extra, but the Oil are deep at center, and Habs are deep at wing - What say you?
4669 2018-01-11 16:03:29 Saudi Arabia has shortlisted New York, London and Hong Kong - singly or in a combination of two or even all three - for the international portion of the listing of national oil company Aramco, two sources with knowledge of the discussions said.
4670 2018-01-11 16:03:26 My car is taking a real shit on me. My headlight is out, leaking oil bad, leaking coolant, heater doesn’t work, I’m on my spare tire, my exhaust is hanging off and who knows what else lol
4671 2018-01-11 16:03:16 Otra vez volvemos, que uno vea que estan pagando lotes caros no significa que necesariamente vaya a salir a vender, y después sostener que $pgr sigue el oil es un gran chiste. El oil en maximos desde hace años y la garompa esta -40% desde máximos del año pasado.
4672 2018-01-11 16:03:13 Good point. Big Mac too probably. Or Oil. But they are consumable. I was thinking of non-consumable products.

4674 2018-01-11 16:02:50 even though i come from a big marathon oil fam, the tesla’s are sick. don’t tell my aunt i said that.
4675 2018-01-11 16:02:48 Coconut oil is the only thing that works for me in the winter!
4676 2018-01-11 16:02:37 Yes, I've actually been and seen them do it. They remove all the elements they can like tyres and oil. It's the metal that gets left and crushed for scrap metal.
4677 2018-01-11 16:02:34 I wonder if Royal Dutch Shell & BP will be paying Tax on metered barrels of oil this year?
4678 2018-01-11 16:02:33 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
4679 2018-01-11 16:02:14 It's the classic 'market agent with no agency' mindset. The oil company just goes 'don't look at me, it's the market that demands it', as if they're compelled by a force of nature to actively produce products they know to be damaging
4680 2018-01-11 16:02:14 There’s no reason to give it to oil companies cause there’s no oil there.

4683 2018-01-11 16:02:08 “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you all you have to do is put in some effort.
4684 2018-01-11 16:01:52 Although oil is known as “black gold,” it can also be green, brown, or red.

4685 2018-01-11 16:01:48 Ask your self how your guns and hunting gear is made?
Oh right Oil....like everything else in the world.
Wake up people. Oil requirements are for ever!!!
And don’t forget about the amount of Canadian jobs that are due to oil production. Never mind the jobs that support the mines.
4686 2018-01-11 16:01:43 Wow . I need to get my closure fixed . I mean damn . Maybe I should chill with the wild growth oil lol
4687 2018-01-11 16:01:34 I remember reading an interview with Thom Yorke where he expounded on the Peak Oil thesis and now I want to find it for a laugh

4690 2018-01-11 16:01:14 The medicinal benefits far out way any recereational use. The CBD oil in the marijuana plant is what is used as relief from chemo. And seizures for epilepsy.  That’s what the “big” deal is about legalizing it. It truly is medicine 
4691 2018-01-11 16:01:08 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
4692 2018-01-11 16:01:07 Also would have liked to have seen FH people in the coconut oil group in this experiment.
4693 2018-01-11 16:01:06 It wasnt enough, pour the hot oil on her face
4694 2018-01-11 16:00:59 It's hypocritical, but it's not wrong. The oil companies are providing the gas for that SUV, and for decades have lied about the impact of their products and impeded progress to transition away from them
4695 2018-01-11 16:00:54 With oil and copper going up, I’m surprised FCX has not approached mid $20’s.

4697 2018-01-11 16:00:48 Given that the development of Saudi Arabia was predicated on the discovery of oil, which occurred after the expulsion of the Ottomans, not sure there’s much of a causal chain
4698 2018-01-11 16:00:34 Infact, since your tweet, international price of crude oil has increased by 3/4th of a dollar.
4699 2018-01-11 16:00:18 Вот смотри: в плане порассуждать, подискутировать, обсудить интересную тему - ты молодец. А вот в плане сообразительности или бытовых вещей - нулячая.

4700 2018-01-11 16:00:09 Tribe violence has been on+off 4yrs. Even affecting IOCs. Situation may improve, Baghdad won't allow 2 fester as oil $ rise.2) Tuz local violence also nt new+v serious in past. Difference now, engagement is back.3) Public sector reform=existential challenge KRI+Baghdad must share
4701 2018-01-11 16:00:04 I'm pretty sure by the time the 43-year-old white men all become parents, coconut oil will be a big staple in the black household.

4705 2018-01-11 15:59:56 Thank you. I have FH so I am interested in inflammation in particular and tg levels. Does Coconut oil not result in less inflammation - hence the increase in HDL in this experiment by as substantial amount and a small decrease in LDL not suggest this is the case? Layperson asking
4706 2018-01-11 15:59:43 Update: at least two vehicles involved one was a small car and the other a tanker. Injuries unknown. Road still blocked in both directions as a crew cleaned up oil on the ground. A full report at noon @wjxt4

4711 2018-01-11 15:59:10 Price of crude oil has increased by several dollars in that period. Is currently at highest level since 2015
4712 2018-01-11 15:59:09 Putting oil rigs off the coast would have the potential to be an environmental and economic disaster for this state, and I can't believe that anyone in NC would be in favor of it.

4716 2018-01-11 15:58:45 Funny isn’t it. Unlike the things they pretend about, on things they actually care about (e.g., extra-cruel deportation, breaking up non-white families, tax breaks for real estate partnerships, protecting Mar-a-lago from oil rigs) they seem to be relatively good at execution.

4720 2018-01-11 15:58:23 Olives can not produce pure oil until they are stomped pressed , and squeezed!
Don't fight the process!
4721 2018-01-11 15:58:18 Random thought......Of #Natgas, #Crudeoil and #Electricity, Oil is the only one you can really put in a truck or rail car and get it to where it needs to go in a pinch....
4722 2018-01-11 15:58:08 Yea it is. But it’s like that cause they don’t tap into pools of oil like back home. It’s shale oil up here
4723 2018-01-11 15:58:08 Then it boggles my mind that you think putting oil rigs off the outer banks is a good idea. There are so many solar farms within 10 miles of me that i can't even name them all, and most of them are so hidden you'd never know they were there if you were just riding by.

4726 2018-01-11 15:57:06 Won't happen because the oil companies (who have hidden and worked against the acceptance of the scientific results and tied it so closely to politics) would be guilty of crimes against the planet and humanity. They have lead us down this road to ruin and now we all have to pay.

4755 2018-01-11 15:52:44 Oil price was the highest it had been in years, during the GEJ era, well over $100 per barrel. What was done with the money then? Where are the savings? When GEJ and cohorts were stuffing money left and right, that was how they steered us rightly?

4777 2018-01-11 15:49:44 Fair market value for a barrel of oil is 12 - 19 USD at most. It will find its fair market value eventually. It might take a decade.... or even two. But it will find it.

4786 2018-01-11 15:48:58 The house got cold enough because my landlords didn't order oil before we left for break. Not sure how the mouse got inside and I really don't know why I'm the only one who finds an issue with keeping the keurig
4787 2018-01-11 15:48:57 Gotta be an adult and get an oil change today 
4788 2018-01-11 15:48:47 Oil production ALSO only works in very specific areas and causes damage to local environments, destroys economies based on making a living utilizing coastlines and ocean, and provides long-term damage that only becomes apparent with time.

4797 2018-01-11 15:47:58 @realDonaldTrump PRESIDENTEN PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANYMORE OIL FROM THE COMMUNIST MADURO!
4798 2018-01-11 15:47:53 Ahora sí me animo a empezar a shortear #petróleo #WTI #Oil
4799 2018-01-11 15:47:47 Pretty soon they’ll be drinking royal purple motor oil cause it makes them “Royal”
4800 2018-01-11 15:47:45 I'll put it on record - I don't know if Bitcoin will be a bad ending - but I know oil will be. I'd bet my life. $BTC $WTI $USOIL
4801 2018-01-11 15:47:40 @AlleenBrown just heard your report on NPR regarding Dakota pipe spills.  Wish you had some data on spills from "traditional" oil transportation and its environmental impacts for comparison @NPR @wgbh @TheTakeaway
4802 2018-01-11 15:47:36 Love Orson but his Rochester way overwhelmed Fontaine's mousy Jane - he was like Lord Byron stepped down from a 19th century oil painting. The 2011 version was much more centered on a strong, indomitable Jane, as was the book. But the 1943 version is great classic Hollywood.
4803 2018-01-11 15:46:58 現地大丈夫でっす
4804 2018-01-11 15:46:58 Wait, is big oil not a problem?
4805 2018-01-11 15:46:56 The oil rally continues as WTI hits the highest since December 2014
4806 2018-01-11 15:46:55 El clima tampoco  ayuda...  Este año dos grandes pulseadas, el IPO de Aramco y la licitación petrolera más grande de EEUU en golfo de México... Mientras tanto up el oil..   A veces pienso no lo harán para vender acciones y licitación a mejor precio???
4807 2018-01-11 15:46:45 WTI oil +$0.30 at $63.87/barrel buoyed by a surprise decline in U.S. production and lower U.S. inventories. Exxon and Chevron shares rise.
4808 2018-01-11 15:46:44 All you care about is getting the wall for your image and what is left of your reputation- it is a sham and why aren’t the Mexicans paying for it like you “promised” you are merely a snake oil BS’ing salesman - that is what you’ve always been - where r your taxes
4809 2018-01-11 15:46:41 I used a lot of lemon oil during my pregnancy. There's one by burts bees I really loved. The scent really help my morning sickness
4810 2018-01-11 15:46:30 Hypocrite NYC burns oil for heat and cars/ 1 of largest oil consumers sueing oil co for global warming. Ridiculous

4812 2018-01-11 15:46:27 I drink a #keto coffee or tea each morning, but I use oils... curious why use powders versus oils? Just easier, less messy? Or is there a nutritional reason why powder over oil?
4813 2018-01-11 15:46:19 i stayed home from school today because my hair looks oily from a hot oil hair treatment i did & i guess washing my hair 2 times after it WASN'T ENOUGH
4814 2018-01-11 15:46:17 What did he do, when his mates were wringing the country of her resources? What did he do when we were failing to refine our oil within our shores? Is it the fault of a person who was born in 1997?
4815 2018-01-11 15:46:07 got to get my oil change today as bad as I dont want to pay for it 
4816 2018-01-11 15:45:50 Hoo boy, de Blasio is suing 5 major oil companies over global warming. Meanwhile there's piles of garbage everywhere cuz he can't figure out how to haul it away. Way to go voters! Keep electing Democrats!
4817 2018-01-11 15:45:44 Apparently everything is wet so they can't figure out what's water and what's oil 
The guy got like three opinions about it

4819 2018-01-11 15:45:36 Jemila, it's so sad that Ghana don't see the need to invest in TOURISM, because I think is the new oil/cocoa now ; look at Dubai I don't need to talk again
4820 2018-01-11 15:45:25 I would like to be completely vegan someday. I avoid dairy products, eggs and honey. But sometimes when I eat outside I eat cheese if there isn't an alternative and also, there are some things that we don't even know aren't vegan like palm oil.
4821 2018-01-11 15:45:23 they are... they're obsessed with squeezing out every last drop of oil and building more highways n stuff, so i was surprised she'd even mention the climate at all. granted i'm not super knowledgeable on politics...
4822 2018-01-11 15:45:17 หวังเหมือนเดิมว่าที่นู่นอากาศจะไม่ใจร้ายเท่าไหร่
4823 2018-01-11 15:45:14 Hot oil hand treatment. Get done cheap nitrile gloves (in case of latex sensitivity) and any oil like coconut, avocado, grapeseed or jojoba. Portable tub/big bowl of hot water. Slather on oil. Put on gloves. Soak gloved hands in hot water.
4824 2018-01-11 15:45:11 ค่ะ ตอนนี้ปากกาเหลือเป็นรูปอลิสแท่งเดียวค่ะ ไม่ทราบว่าสนใจไหมคะ
4825 2018-01-11 15:45:10 Yes, it is nominal oil prices.
4826 2018-01-11 15:45:07 The Iranian people do not see oil revenues, so the Iranian government should be boycotted due to non-observance of human rights. Iran's minimum oil resources will not be used to help terrorists.#IranProtests
4827 2018-01-11 15:45:06 No me parece que a $pgr la traccione el oil, esta muy manijeada, engrampo a muchos, no soy comprador de lotes con esa IV ni mamado
4828 2018-01-11 15:44:57 Watch out Norway! You have oil and ya know how Trump wants to steal all that from everywhere so we can keep driving giant SUVs.
4829 2018-01-11 15:44:34 Over time, I'll still form oil
Will just take my sweet time

4830 2018-01-11 15:44:29 The #soybean oil market is waiting patiently for tomorrow’s WASDE report.  The expectation is for greater soybean stockpiles in the US, but biodiesel demand for soybean oil will continue to constrain the fat balance sheet.
4831 2018-01-11 15:44:28 Do you use solid or liquid coconut oil for this?

4835 2018-01-11 15:44:17 Facial oil (ITS GOOD FOR OILY SKIN TOO!!!!) julep rosehip seed reparative facial oil!! Just a couple drops and it helps with redness and imperfections overnight! That shit is MAGIC!!! 
4836 2018-01-11 15:44:08 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
4837 2018-01-11 15:44:04 Dan that oil down GT 
4838 2018-01-11 15:43:59 Yes. The country transformed from a third to developed country as it expanded westwards. Coal in the Appalachia, gold in California, oil in Texas, silver in Mid-West.
4839 2018-01-11 15:43:57 my mom and i almost burned the house down together because i left a candle burning overnight and she poured water on the oil fire this morning,,, what a bonding experience!

4841 2018-01-11 15:43:55 Omg I got my oil, thank god, my anxiety has been so bad
4842 2018-01-11 15:43:48 Matt, could you please ask your wife how Trump/Zinke can justify the reversal on oil drilling in Florida but not other States. Looks purely political, and grossly so, to me. How is that draining the swamp?
4843 2018-01-11 15:43:30 I put cedar wood essential oil on it because it helps with inflammation and it worked so well. My lower back literally has a small part that’s swollen :(
4844 2018-01-11 15:43:23 Trump should invite Clinton’s/Franken’s/Weinstein’s victims to attend & wear fluorescent pink.
4845 2018-01-11 15:43:14 Check your Engine oil today.
4846 2018-01-11 15:43:13 Spot on, Adam.  That is why some people have been worrying about the long term investment in the industry.   I am writing a column that will appear in press soon: what if major oil producers believe in the extreme bullish cases of shale and EVs?
4847 2018-01-11 15:43:11 Denny Hamlin changed your oil

4850 2018-01-11 15:42:58 @spokanetom 
Liked you tweet on green cards and 
Any of his hotels. 
And BTW did you hear there won't be any drilling  for oil off the coast 
In The state of Florida,  someone might want to tell the douche bag
A oil spill  can move up and down a coast line
4851 2018-01-11 15:42:54 I had to go to 3 different Walmart’s to find some damn castor oil but I was not giving up on my mission
4852 2018-01-11 15:42:48 But the typical politicians like Clinton should rather leave you as is. Clinton Fundation lives subsidies of the oil as many of the others. Stop in the pollution.
4853 2018-01-11 15:42:35 Manufacturers prescribe maintenance plans (oil, fluids, belts, tires, etc), governments legislate inspections. There's a social mechanism in place for cars and other physical assets.
4854 2018-01-11 15:42:29 What about the oil going all over the place from no lid on the bottle!?
4855 2018-01-11 15:42:28 A 3:2 ratio of rosemary oil to eucalyptus oil creates a refreshing scent. The aroma of eucalyptus is pretty strong, so it works best with a low or mid-range note to balance it.
4856 2018-01-11 15:42:20 Ran thru a full tank in two days Lls oil change finna kno me lik rn
4857 2018-01-11 15:42:15 @cspanwj  Hold ON?!  Public Utilities.. Like your Electric Company, Gas Company, Oil Company & some Water Companies..

Going from 35% Tax to 21% Tax?  SOME Public Utilities pledging LOWER PRICES!

NOW THIS is something I WANT to HEAR ABOUT?  Wow!!!
4858 2018-01-11 15:42:08 i do not wanna pay for this oil change.

4860 2018-01-11 15:41:48 dab of olive oil or the orange oil sticky remover for really stubborn labels
4861 2018-01-11 15:41:47 im outta conditioner but i havemt washed my hair in seven days and tomorrow is the class with the Cute One in it so...... . .. just apply too much camelia oil and hope for the best
4862 2018-01-11 15:41:45 Shut up olive oil
4863 2018-01-11 15:41:44 They should be happy the had oil to heat their homes during this last cold spell. Better yet, bet they also enjoyed that warm sweater they wore, which by chance, was made with petroleum.
4864 2018-01-11 15:41:38 I just use plain coconut oil each evening.
4865 2018-01-11 15:41:20 US oil consumption will probably be over 20M bpd by end of 2019 so the US will still be a massive net consumer rather than a producer of oil.
4866 2018-01-11 15:41:17 Let me borrow your car to go to Miami and you get mineI don’t wanna drive mine bc it has a slow oil leak but the man said it should be ok! SUS YOU JUST TRIED IT
4867 2018-01-11 15:41:13 Ok, I'm guessing the coconut oil emmulsifies/saturates the grounds.
I make homemade scrubs and body butters, so I think I'll give this a try.
4868 2018-01-11 15:41:11 เราลองแล้วนะคะ กันน้ำดีในระดับนึง ล้างออกด้วย micellar water ที่ไม่ใช่ oil ออกได้ค่อนข้างดีค่ะ
4869 2018-01-11 15:41:04 Hello @TestKitchen,
In your post about Mediterranean food, you stated that olive oil was a key ingredient. What are a few examples of dishes that uses olive oil in a creative way? Thank you in advance.
4870 2018-01-11 15:41:02 $IFR.V  Up 20% today.  They just got permission from the Mexico government to start oil drilling.  #Mexicooil is the next #Bakken. #Oil
4871 2018-01-11 15:40:59 CBD oil has been shown to get people off the addiction to opioids. This should be part of the conversation. Relieves pain. No side effects.
4872 2018-01-11 15:40:43 If de Blasio were really serious about taking down evil oil companies and "protecting the planet" he would restrict the usage of electricity in NYC.  Mandate a reduced number of hours per day all users could tap into the City's power grid.  If he was serious he would do it.
4873 2018-01-11 15:40:43 Fed up of eating oil free. Its time to lubricate taste buds
4874 2018-01-11 15:40:35 I disagree with her free car giveaway as someone concerned about global oil usage 
4875 2018-01-11 15:40:34 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
4876 2018-01-11 15:40:33 What a silly line of questioning. How about stop living in the past and deal with today's issues. You are as bad as a snake oil salesman pushing this stuff...
4877 2018-01-11 15:40:31 "It costs something like $30 to extract a barrel of crude oil in Nigeria. So when oil was trading at $110 Nigeria had a margin of around $80 to play with. But when oil drops to $45 as it has now, that $80 margin turns to $15."
4878 2018-01-11 15:40:31 Oil just upticked to $64.37. The rebound continues! #Permian #Shale #Miracle

4883 2018-01-11 15:39:50 My dad insisted that I HAD to go check my oil tank right this second since there's a "huge snowstorm" coming tomorrow. So I go outside & put a yard stick in it & as I'm lifting it out, I dropped the fucking stick into the tank 
4884 2018-01-11 15:39:49 How do u feel about polluting oceans for oil money? Children dying as CHIP is ignored? Russia interfering in our election? Is money worth being a traitor?
4885 2018-01-11 15:39:40 Do you grease up the pan with butter or oil?
4886 2018-01-11 15:39:10 ...... i feel a little called out because it does rn........ chika gave me the rose oil!!!!!!!
4887 2018-01-11 15:39:07 Is it painted green now or are you using some alternative energy source to light it? Hope it's not coal or oil.
4888 2018-01-11 15:39:06 Hendon is amazing. Do you think the big bombers had a major impact? I think Beevor says the terror bombing didn’t but targeting oil production did
4889 2018-01-11 15:39:05 Jojoba oil is my favorite oil outta all the oils.
4890 2018-01-11 15:39:04 A rally in oil took Brent crude closer towards $70 a barrel on Thursday
4891 2018-01-11 15:39:00 What link exactly? I earn nothing from outing frauds and snake oil salesmen. Is this the best you can do?
4892 2018-01-11 15:38:59 Continually amazed at the idiocrasy of NYCity who yesterday Sued major oil companies over Climate Change! What a waste of taxpayers dollars.  No wonder 76% of NYC residents think they are tax unfairly & wasted with so many other city needs
4893 2018-01-11 15:38:53 I'm not sure I want to know how you are expert in beard oil..
4894 2018-01-11 15:38:53 I know there's a lot of bad stuff in the world because of the internet, but I still think it's the best. One day I decided I wanted to learn everything about the 2010 BP oil spill and it took me like an hour.

4896 2018-01-11 15:38:48 Those keystone cops need to be boiled in oil and left out to fester in the sun for shooting and killing an unarmed man suffering with schizophrenia.

4899 2018-01-11 15:37:50 Realist shit I ever read: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
4900 2018-01-11 15:37:41 They've bought into the saturated fats are bad myth from what I can tell. They're pushing fish, olive oil, avocados, & canola oil.
4901 2018-01-11 15:37:37 My thought on seeing 'de Blasio' behind this move was that he just massively increased campaign donations to his enemies.  He was already an embattled progressive 'crusader' with very powerful enemies in NY, now he's provoked the multinational Oil Interests Dragon - yikes!
4902 2018-01-11 15:37:29 Do oil treatments and stop putting heat to your hair sometimes drops wont do it
4903 2018-01-11 15:37:25 also relates to that WV china investment story @davesjolly shared. i wonder if anybody's compiled the aggregate financials of US oil producers; The companies I followed were total basket cases but I have no idea about the industry as a whole; how much debt is attached per barrel.

4911 2018-01-11 15:36:30 Part of it is lower gas prices. Part of it is the push by auto industry. And many ppl want trucks which aren't electric.
This Big Oil suit may start to change that.

4924 2018-01-11 15:35:27 We wanted an oil fund but, apparently, it wasn't necessary.
4925 2018-01-11 15:35:21 New York City joins other cities and suing the top five oil companies for creating climate change geez I thought it was all of us humans that did it using the oil products
4926 2018-01-11 15:35:19 Two elderly women protest against big oil in Canada and the police go after them with an axe.
4927 2018-01-11 15:35:19 Problem is, until a politician can make BIG BUCKS off of alt-energy/fuel, they are gonna stick with their big oil buddies, right?
4928 2018-01-11 15:35:11 20818 brings higher rates which ends home refi's - the prior piggy bank for consumer spending. Higher rates will hit CC/loan repayments $ spending is further impacted by higher inflation/oil. Some benefit from tax cut for some. Debt/delinquncies are high & climbing. Bid it up.

Florida and California will oppose this threat

by standing in solidarity to protect their rights

big oil, big heads will have to look elsewhere
4933 2018-01-11 15:34:56 The fact is when you see all those bloody flags @TurnbullMalcolm has around him when standing Union Jack stands out. It comes back to this man like fish in oil not pretty sight gasping for air he flips around then nothing well in case fish dead so all you do is throw it out fact
4934 2018-01-11 15:34:48 Which sounds ridiculous because OIL, but holy balls.
4935 2018-01-11 15:34:36 YES. I recently discovered washing with castor oil and jojoba oil, and it's changed my life.

4938 2018-01-11 15:34:18 sir oil making any view where resistance is?
4939 2018-01-11 15:34:17 A panda’s fur is coated with oil, which keeps the animal waterproof.
4940 2018-01-11 15:34:16 So here's a question. If higher oil is inflationary enough for the fed to raise rates by more than the dot plot  (3/4 25bp hikes prices this year), that's 1) surely going to screw Turkey both ways on its c/a deficit and FDI flows.

4946 2018-01-11 15:33:37 Nobody in Europe cooks with vegetable oil.
4947 2018-01-11 15:33:30 A soothing facial mask, sultry red, with berries, tea tree oil, and exfoliating fig seeds. It comes as a smooth gel.
4948 2018-01-11 15:33:30 we all know when Orange Hairpiece abolishes a crucial regulation, a sane person dies a slow emotional death
4949 2018-01-11 15:33:30 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4950 2018-01-11 15:33:30 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
4951 2018-01-11 15:33:22 Rumor they've been melting arctic purposely for years to get at oil reserves under ice cap
4952 2018-01-11 15:33:05 de Blasio, if you were really serious about taking down evil oil companies and "protecting the planet" you would restrict the usage of electricity in NYC.  Mandate a reduced number of hours per day all users could tap into the City's power grid.  Do it if you really love NYC.
4953 2018-01-11 15:32:56 Not only does @jiffylube have great service but the guy who's doing my oil change is super cute. 
4954 2018-01-11 15:32:56 + Interesting Q: Why is #Turkey mediating?

Could it be loss of income & leverage? #Oil exports through #Ceyhan down about 250k bbl/d after 16/10 cutting transit fees by 1/2, + #Iraq-#Iran oil swap deal takes 60k bbl/d from future exports.  Both = loss of income + leverage

4955 2018-01-11 15:32:54 ขอให้คืนนี้ผ่านไปด้วยดี
4956 2018-01-11 15:32:31 thanks, bryan. to be honest, i've heard all this before. moving away from palm oil doesn't mean creating a monoculture. there are many alternatives. furthermore, the RSPO is a complete sham.
4957 2018-01-11 15:32:28 Why?  They are clear as day about climate change & always have been.  Oil companies never denied that the polar ice caps & glaciers melt when the temperature increases above the freezing point of H2O & contaminants, which is the language defining the composition.  They informed.

4961 2018-01-11 15:32:14 What about first drinking olive oil first ?
4962 2018-01-11 15:32:11 You are one of the most despised people on the planet. People fell for your snake oil pitch.  Now they're finding out what you're really all about. So is Mueller's team. Soon everybody will be breathing a sigh of relief, when you are out of the Oval Office!
4963 2018-01-11 15:32:00 Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency. Oil is not...
4964 2018-01-11 15:31:59 How can you sue an industry whose products you voluntarily use? Oil in itself doesn't affect our climate it's the products that burn it, so why isn't the auto industry for example included.
4965 2018-01-11 15:31:53 I think @realDonaldTrump owns property in CA...?  Use that as leverage....no oil spills mucking up the Don’s landscape.  Worked for Florida.
4966 2018-01-11 15:31:51 @PilotFlyingJ just lost my household's business forever.

Remember #ExxonValdez oil spill? Haven't bought their products since then.
4967 2018-01-11 15:31:45 because he doesn't have a Golf resort there! Start putting oil rigs lined up on the coast in front of his resorts in Florida or Ireland...pathetic hypocrisy that he gets away with...STAND UP AND CALL HIM OUT ON IT!!!  DISGRACEFUL!!!
4968 2018-01-11 15:31:39 For a non-toxic kitchen cleaner, fill a flip-top shaker container half full of baking soda and add 15-20 drops of a pure essential oil,
4969 2018-01-11 15:31:19 Feline Pine gives off a faint odor that can only be smelled within 5 inches of the litter box. The cats do not hang around in the pine pellets for more than a minute. This is not a heavy, scented oil being dispersed in the air. The urine smell is stronger than the pine smell.
4970 2018-01-11 15:31:15 Thanks for this. I'm always looking for new ideas on how to oil the ideas gears. My experience is that great ideas come with #unconventional people looking at the problem. Wondering whether hiring random people to participate in ideation sessions is a crazy idea? A business idea?

4973 2018-01-11 15:31:05 a big shift from coconut oil to coconut milk.
4974 2018-01-11 15:30:58 It's 2:30am. I'm camping, a bit of a personal character building exercise! I decided, since there's LOTS of rain coming I'd put a tarp over the tent! OMG it's so noisy in the wind! Sleep is impossible! A noisy tarp! Who'd have seen that coming? I wonder if one can buy tarp oil.
4975 2018-01-11 15:30:57 The US policy should be to stop pushing a foreign policy that invokes foreign reactions from extremists, end oil dependence, and stop funding groups who hate our enemies abroad... this nothing but a failed attempt to control global economics! STOP! #MAGA
4976 2018-01-11 15:30:41 To have JIT according to parent is their right but if they have some reservations they shd give solid reasons. It is not good attempt to try to extinguish fire of murdering Zainab by putting oil of reservations at JIT. Grow up @javeednusrat @BolBolPakistan_ @gulmeenay

4978 2018-01-11 15:30:20 Those oil rigs are gonna look really pretty just off the coast of the Outer Banks. Your voters are gonna love that you sold out to a Russian conspirator and all they got was black sludge beaches.

4985 2018-01-11 15:29:56 I was really good at my job in the oil drilling business and I thought I was a expert, but now I know I wasn’t, I just worked too hard.
4986 2018-01-11 15:29:53 ok euro trade recovering nicely wont add tho as missed. Yen trade still suffering but let it work its magic. oil and equities will help me here
4987 2018-01-11 15:29:51 Germany COULD hit its goals if they went back to nuclear big time. As it stands, the German economy will be mostly fueled by oil and coal. #NoChance
4988 2018-01-11 15:29:46 GET RID OF THE NDP , SCRAP THE CLIMATE TAX, CUT OFF THE OIL TO THE EAST AND GO AND GET A BETTER DEAL WITH THE STATES ! TALK TO BC AND GET AN AGREEMENT WITH THEM TALK TO THE WESTERN PROVINCES ABOUT SEPERATION ! WOULD NOT PAY ANY MORE MONEY TO THE EAST ! NO PIPE LINE NO MONEY !
4989 2018-01-11 15:29:40 My thoughts exactly. Try again, Gary. Don’t forget to slather some coconut oil on your torso!
4990 2018-01-11 15:29:35 Ever put too much much oil in your diffuser and can’t breathe?
4991 2018-01-11 15:29:30 We all know the technology exists to propel our vehicles without gas.  Will you be addressing this?  Should we not be on the cutting edge in developing them for mass use?  I know, but the oil companies and their investments.. nothing lasts forever.  MAGA
4992 2018-01-11 15:29:15 Discounted oil changes
4993 2018-01-11 15:29:01 Then oil companies need to add a 3.00 a gallon surcharge to New York to pay to defend themselves from the local politicians and let New Yorkers know surcharge will go away when they vote politicians out. Liberal problem solved.  New York turns red overnight.
4994 2018-01-11 15:28:59 Really helps give you perspective. Also, there are many more people from different socioeconomic backgrounds. I know both the children of oil sheikhs and people who can barely afford to attend college at all. It’s amazing how much different backgrounds influence who people are.
4995 2018-01-11 15:28:59 Very cautious recent spike up crude oil..

4999 2018-01-11 15:28:46 yes - that is the beginning and end of any justification for money from oil companies to address climate change. right.

Only to find that since it's raining 

They can't figure out where the oil is leaking from 

so ill have to bring it back
5002 2018-01-11 15:28:34 Coconut oil, coffee grounds, turbinado sugar or kosher salt, additional oils like grapeseed and avocado and some vanilla extract for fragrance. Great body scrub!
5003 2018-01-11 15:28:28 Church like? Nah, the brick and mortar was replaced with oil and sackcloth ages ago. An awesome transformation, wouldn't you agree
5004 2018-01-11 15:28:17 Yep. They’re just doing it in North Korea and sharing missile technology and oil as well. Well done Obama.
5005 2018-01-11 15:28:17 Are they hand crafting this oil or what?
5006 2018-01-11 15:27:59 US equities hitting yet more record highs. USD/JPY < 112; WTI oil > $64 (multi-year highs). BTC/USD > $14,000.
5007 2018-01-11 15:27:58 Also in this experiment coconut oil raised LDL by 14%  but only decreased LDL by 0.9 mm/LL. What did the academics have to say about those ratios @DrMichaelMosley ? As some one with FH who takes statins - this is of great interest to me. Thanks.

5037 2018-01-11 15:25:41 Those who divested coal companies 10 years ago made a great financial decision. Plus your industry just spits at those of us who want oil and gas to cut carbon. You fight key policy actions. Your decision. Our decision is to use less.
5038 2018-01-11 15:25:41 You would be better off putting butter, cream, and coconut oil in it. Bulletproof coffee is an excellent breakfast.

5043 2018-01-11 15:25:10 i hate getting my oil changed
5044 2018-01-11 15:25:10 Russia helped Trump become President just so they would be weaker against Ukraine. And Russia really wanted US to possibly take some of their gas / oil deals. I thought Russia was smarter. Did they disrupt our democracy? Yes -Look at Mueller's bogus investigation of collusion.

5055 2018-01-11 15:24:19 The “I don’t drink wine” men are infuriating. Guzzling liquor and pissing motor oil cause you don’t want to expand your palate and identify the different notes in some good wine.

Brexshit is nothing more than a racist, xenophobic, right-wing, isolationist vanity project run by crooks (fraudsters and tax-dodgers) and liars. Brexshiters are basically no better than snake oil sellers!
5062 2018-01-11 15:23:26 How can New York run without Oil?
5063 2018-01-11 15:23:23 I engage with sensible people but you are just weird. Anyway good luck convincing anyone ScotGov gets oil revenue from North Sea.
5064 2018-01-11 15:23:11 So we spend tax payer money  to give to public attorneys to sue high priced, best in the world attorneys, over climate change. The oil companies counter sue the taxpayers for Atty fees. The Mayor can say he tried. Next time give the money back to the taxpayers or hire more cops

5067 2018-01-11 15:23:06 @BilldeBlasio will you support the regulation of the home heating oil industry that steals $ from City taxpayers and your constituents individually?  It’s widely known that delivery companies short customers over and over.  Why no action after last years criminal investigations?
5068 2018-01-11 15:22:50 You’re picking names now that accurately describes Jason Kenney, right? Swarmy faced snake oil salesmen and liar fit him like a glove, too!
5069 2018-01-11 15:22:28 So the gov is looking into why people had to wait for oil delivery during coldest week. 24 hour deliveries for 8 days. How about homeowners watch the weather and not wait until they’re out

5078 2018-01-11 15:21:11 Newfoundland could always follow New York’s suit, and sue the hand that fed it; the big oil companies. Alleging their involvment in global warming.
5079 2018-01-11 15:21:09 One of the weird things I try not to be too paranoid about is the idea of things not being what they really are when you buy them. Like yeah, I'm paying $7 for a bottle of "olive oil" but it's really the stuff in the $3 canola oil jug.
5080 2018-01-11 15:20:31 for acne, one suggestion I have is to end your showers with a bit of cold water. my friends also say running ice against their acne a few times a day helps. these things help get rid of excess oil so your skin isn't prone to spreading the acne.

5099 2018-01-11 15:19:10 OK so if you go on Amazon, there's a ton of Oil of Oregano. If you have a local homeopathic store, I'd go there first. They can help ensure you get a pure, high-grade oil. You want to make sure of that before you ingest it.  We take 4 drops down our throat each day.
5100 2018-01-11 15:19:09 Kenney would make the problems caused by oil price collapse and 44 years of PC mismanagement and neglect 1000 X worse with his job killing cuts and austerity. He has no plans to help ordinary citizens of AB.

5106 2018-01-11 15:18:36 1-2 I think it is more than economics:  remember the truckers who blocked traffic in several European cities, roads and highways in 2000 because of higher oil prices? 
How will the Russians, Chinese, and Iranians view that?
5107 2018-01-11 15:18:32 Factory work got me through uni. Partly for the money, but largely to make me not want to do it for the rest of my life. FTR, most all fuel/oil/air filters for cars are the same. 
5108 2018-01-11 15:18:07 Had to go to the website of the U.S. Embassy in Ireland to look something up for work. They were advertising a quiz about U.S. National Parks, with nothing about oil and gas exploration.  Someone should tell Ryan Zinke about this oversight!
5109 2018-01-11 15:17:52 It's all about inventories! US shale is producing 50%of oil with API gravity higher than 45 and of inconsistent quality! The market knows that a supply shock is coming... and raise prices accordingly!
5110 2018-01-11 15:17:51 I mean. Come on. Stop fracking and grow weed?! Oh, I'm sure the oil industry would *totes* totally be on board with that.

5112 2018-01-11 15:17:44 He's only using this as a homey folksy prose to lure you into submission so that he can take more money from poor people, promising prosperity, and still not pay taxes. Because Jesus I think. He's a snake oil salesman with less class.

5121 2018-01-11 15:16:54 Not really any attraction to it. Just other options are bad. Current set up has been mediocre at best. Portable toilets, temporary seating. Lucas oil will have better amenities but it’ll be 10k people in a venue for 60k.
5122 2018-01-11 15:16:47 This is a great thing. The oil industry has tried to also silence workers from talking about a fair & safe working environment. Thanks to free speech & social media silence no more.

5125 2018-01-11 15:16:29 I use a oil bubbler with a bead check valve. Doesn't give great pressure, but adequate for our need. To second what @Synthon61 said, I have seen some chemists use oil bubblers with no check valves, but close to 1L of oil, and a 1L reservoir up top. Sucks if it gets contaminated.

5186 2018-01-11 15:10:48 Mainly, it is to stop any oil from washing ashore at Mar-A-Largo, which would decrease real estate prices significantly.
5187 2018-01-11 15:10:44 No doubt the oil lobby is powerful, but it is legal.  It’s a waste of time to try to get them to change their practices if they are legal.  Reform of campaign funding is the only answer.  We should be blaming greedy legislators.

5209 2018-01-11 15:08:31 1) Since 2016, Oil price has always risen above our budget bench mark price yet our excess crude account keeps going down everyday. As at today, the price of crude oil per barrel is 22 dollars above the budget benchmark price. @OlaFabiyi2 @omonlakiki @PDPYouthLeader
5210 2018-01-11 15:08:26 LMAO! Can't believe that you are peddling this snake oil. This coming from a senator whose State violated the Constitution with its illegal gerrymandering of the voting system. Very disappointing, Senator. VERY disappointing. For shame.

5212 2018-01-11 15:08:16 My mind was educated by Jesuits who believe in action.  Just as Jesus threw out the money changers & took on the evil of Rome, so must we too garner our faith in an act of bravery & fight!  Trump is compromised, possibly being blackmailed while Oil and Russia takes over.

5235 2018-01-11 15:05:46 Not 100% true.  There are oil platforms off the SoCal coast that can be see from the shore.  Not sure they are still operational, but they are eyesores!
5236 2018-01-11 15:05:32 OIL/Gold companies... there is a BIG difference between exploration companies. One may just have land claims, one have drilled core samples, then there is actual mining, and then there is producing. Find the PRODUCERS! Many cryptos are at the CLAIMS stage

5242 2018-01-11 15:05:00 Imho we are too focused on current green energy. We need to continue useing oil for 20 30 years with capture tech and a huge push for more efficient generators and semi conductors. More focus on types like piezoelectric, even jet stream kites. Or deep sea stream currents.
5243 2018-01-11 15:04:51 #RickScott #NoOffshoreDrilling only for other states. Screw you. You are admitting that it is dangerous, unnecessary and for profit, as long as it's not in his backyard.

5258 2018-01-11 15:03:28 Edo state just signed a contract for a 5500bpd modular refinery. If every oil producing state sets up such a project not only will they guarantee jobs at all levels for their citizens they would be helping tackle the incessant fuel crisis.

5266 2018-01-11 15:02:55 All the beaches in the US are drive tourism you idiot.  And oil is not the way of the future.  This Californian does not want offshore oil back. I don't want to go to the beach and see the rigs in the ocean.  I don't want to have to worry about oil spills off my beaches.
5267 2018-01-11 15:02:54 Been 3 decades since oil drilling in the Pacific, but frumpy has opened every ocean surrounding U.S. and Alaska to offshore drilling AND relaxed the laws imposed after bp's record spill in the gulf. So now it's wide open drilling and NO LAWS! Why antiquated energy frumpy? IDIOT!

5341 2018-01-11 14:55:36 You can read and write as many reports as you want. People are being put in the poor house in Ontario and NL over green projects. The ones that are feasible (nuclear) no one wants to do in Canada.  Oil sands won’t stop, too many people tied to it.
5342 2018-01-11 14:55:36 @POTUS @realdonaldtrump your against oil drilling....around Florida? Are you afraid of oil drilling off the cost of your golf palace, Mara Fucko?? #ImpeachTheMotherFuckerAlready #traitor #Treason #MoneyLaundering #25thAmendmentNow #Impeach45
5343 2018-01-11 14:55:31 I am an olive oil specialist. Your article is entertaining. Contains no information whatsoever. Do you really even know what would happen if you chugged an entire bottle of olive oil? Because I do. Kudos on getting paid for writing the article though.
5344 2018-01-11 14:55:16 I added a quarter cup of avocado oil to my bath last night. Soothing relief from dry, itchy skin.
5345 2018-01-11 14:55:09 Paying Outlets to lie through their teeth still won't bring up your approval rating Comcast. Here's hoping you get investigated and broken up like Standard Oil did.

5348 2018-01-11 14:55:03 Oil at $70 a barrel & lowest exchange rate = mega profits for oil companies whose corp tax goes straight to WM & isn’t clearly visible in GERS, meanwhile UK Gov gives oil away for 0% PRT which would be visible in GERS!  Same oil traded at London Commodities Exchange more £ for WM
5349 2018-01-11 14:55:00 @boxmining Thanks for your YouTube chan discussing crypto industry. While hype is going to contribute for the next crypto “crash”, ALL major industries have experienced crashes. Oil market, railroads, airlines, and yes dotcom. Crypto will be an industry thus face same evolution.

5354 2018-01-11 14:54:29 Cocoyam and palm oil is underrated.
5355 2018-01-11 14:54:25 If you want to stop offshore oil spilling (I mean drilling) just build a Trump golf course in your state then he won't take any chance like he's doing in Florida  #ThursdayThoughts

5358 2018-01-11 14:54:02 Ban Palm oil. Rain forests are destroyed to produce it, the Oran Otang is declining in numbers because of it! It can cause weight gain, raise cholestral, cause Kidney & liver problems. It's in Bread, cakes, biscuits, pies, chocolate, fruit & nut mix.

5362 2018-01-11 14:53:52 The standard technique of subsidising corporates and shareholders is displayed perfectly with North Sea Oil. The tax take is shifted onto the consumer , in the manner of FUEL DUTY then VAT added on top , resulting in 65% taxation paid by them instead.

Trickle down doesnt work.

5385 2018-01-11 14:51:28 So if the New York State coastline ISNT deemed important to tourism it’s okay to destroy its beaches, water and wildlife? Or is it because it’s a blue state? Oil is dead. So should be your idiotic plan.

5399 2018-01-11 14:49:37 You do know that oil bubbles out of the sea floor off the coast due to high reservoir pressures and doesn't come from the rigs correct?  Or are you just believing the democrat environmentalist tripe because it sounds good and the kool-aid tastes good...

5401 2018-01-11 14:49:32 In reality, you are talking separate issues.
I pointed out there is an overabundance of fossil fuel dependent vehicles and how economically it's virtually a vicious circle.

5427 2018-01-11 14:47:31 Our loss of oil revenue is largely through mismanagement and too generous tax breaks more than price volatility.

5477 2018-01-11 14:43:22 @RepRohrabacher I am shocked at Trump’s decision to open US coastal waters to offshore drilling & ask Rep. Rohrabacher to support H.R. 2272 COAST Anti-Drilling Act to protect our fragile coast. Oil spills are inevitable and lead to grave economic & environmental consequences.
5478 2018-01-11 14:43:21 I’m cool with the ingredients. I just don’t understand why the tortilla is almost transparent from being soaked in oil.
5479 2018-01-11 14:43:16 ウッドストラップ!ウッドストラップ！
5480 2018-01-11 14:43:14 Actually Saudis with all their oil and sun are building nukes, and Chinese too, so even here it doesn't add up.

5482 2018-01-11 14:42:51 I’m allowing Florida to have an exemption to off-shore drilling. Unlike other states (like North and South Carlina), Florida has NICE beaches. Also, my very EXPENSIVE Mar-a-Lago home is in Florida, & it would be SO DUMB to allow oil spills in my own backyard. #ThursdayThoughts
5483 2018-01-11 14:42:47 Ps, this  is not about the cleanliness of my loan car. It’s about you not doing the important 1200 Mile oil change!
5484 2018-01-11 14:42:43 More wars for oil!  Can’t wait!

5487 2018-01-11 14:42:18 More wars for oil!  Can’t wait!
5488 2018-01-11 14:42:15 It's an ad on a diner placement that also says "LOCALLY OWNED" and "OIL CHANGES $24.99"
5489 2018-01-11 14:42:15 No no... gasoline is a spirit. Oil is dinosaur beer.

It's all about the distilling process.
5490 2018-01-11 14:42:13 แล้วไงต่อล่ะบอกที
5491 2018-01-11 14:42:06 Dont you know that the ocean cleans itself from oil spills. Its a natural process. Just ask Rush Limbaugh
5492 2018-01-11 14:41:59 Sellers strong at 10
5493 2018-01-11 14:41:58 How did New Yorkers vote to keep the wacko @NYCMayor in office? Moron threatening to sue oil companies for climate change. He goes to the gym w/ a procession of SUVs, overregulates electric bikes so ppl have to drive, gives parking placards out like candy. #hypocrite
5494 2018-01-11 14:41:56 Ok, we will turn off all gas and oil to NYC. Be careful what you ask for.
5495 2018-01-11 14:41:53 Saudi Arabia wants the price of oil up for their deficit-saving IPO of Saudi Aramco ... you are fighting the sheiks of the desert sands
5496 2018-01-11 14:41:46 I see the little prick Ralston Hymen is this morning blatantly lying about China slowing purchases of US Treasuries, he’s campaigning hard for the PNP. He’s also trying to scare about cost of oil, which is rising before it will fall back as US Shale kicks in to fill the gap.

5500 2018-01-11 14:41:05 I recently discovered Biotherm Total renew Oil Cleanser and love it. Another one I discovered is Fresh Soy Cleanser from Sephora. Not foaming but removed even my eye makeup easily and not dry after,
5501 2018-01-11 14:41:05 Well I know what I am doing as soon as my truck is done getting an oil change.
5502 2018-01-11 14:41:04 明日朝一学校からのバイトとかほんましんどいな
5503 2018-01-11 14:40:57 No, no lol oil cleansing my face!
5504 2018-01-11 14:40:45 OIL DIFF: 5.43 -> 5.55
5505 2018-01-11 14:40:42 The oil companies will not settle as they know this is strictly a money grabbing scheme by the left.  Typical abuse.  Btw, the oil companies can litigate forever on their dime.  Just think howuch taxpayer money is being wasted!!
5506 2018-01-11 14:40:36 Really?? Oil cleansing as in swishing in your mouth? Lol What else do you use it for?
5507 2018-01-11 14:40:34 $CEI well I’ve been holding at .1988 average and I’m getting annoyed. Oil and gas is doing well. What up... still
5508 2018-01-11 14:40:28 Idk if I’m sleeping tonight. Huge day tmrw. I suddenly miss our dining table where I would study late and burn the midnight oil. And Nescafé Creamy White. And sometimes drinking that w/ my insomniac mum who just wanted to keep me company.
5509 2018-01-11 14:40:17 Only 4% of respondents (I was one) to Reuters survey on oil prices expect a return to $100 by 2020. Reminds me of when hardly anyone expected a sustained drop below $100.
5510 2018-01-11 14:40:16 Hahahaha!!!! he gaped it really good.
5511 2018-01-11 14:40:15 Thank you castor oil for making my eyebrows fuller

5514 2018-01-11 14:40:06 If you weren't so ignorant and in the pockets of oil companies then you'd be growing hemp to use for packaging and ditch plastic all together. 
Hemp oil for fuel, left over fibres for fabric, paper, card etc and the waste goes for animal feed.
Pathetic attempt.
5515 2018-01-11 14:39:54 This morning's US #markets open is quite different from yesterday in that #stocks are #higher and yields on government #bonds are largely unchanged. 

Meanwhile, oil continues its move up as prices gain another 0.6%.

#markets #economy #commodities
5516 2018-01-11 14:39:40 institutions of white supremacy: oil magnates, mining corporation, museums, universities, hospitals, countries owe us. What's your 40 acres & a mule today?

5518 2018-01-11 14:39:34 Just because I'm doing this program doesn't mean I've signed up for your essential oil, enzyme, whatever nonsense 
5519 2018-01-11 14:39:28 In honor of the Grand Canyon's anniversary today, 45 is ordering it filled in, paved over, and a morally/financially bankrupt casino built, with an oil well rig in it's lobby.
5520 2018-01-11 14:39:24 Fish oil increases muscle function and quality, especially after resistance training.  Do you take fish oil supplements? I took mine with my breakfast! #fitspo #fitfam #fishoil #thursdaythoughts
5521 2018-01-11 14:39:16 i mean, it’s fine to also use butter or oil for everything. spray is an easy way to quickly and evenly grease your pans.
5522 2018-01-11 14:39:14 We r in the CU and trade/business built around it. Norway hasn’t had those interdependencies relying on oil and fish. Nissan,Ford,Honda,Siemens,Aerospace,Airbus model based on free movement.This will have to be redefined or companies will probably move. Tariffs r less worrying
5523 2018-01-11 14:39:13 Reminds me. Gasoline is a soup. And oil is Dinosaur soup.
5524 2018-01-11 14:39:02 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
5525 2018-01-11 14:39:01 Oil tanker with over a million barrels burning and leaking into the ocean, dead innocent people in Lac Megantic, cancer causing agent, the list is very long!

5531 2018-01-11 14:38:52 This move in oil...
5532 2018-01-11 14:38:40 Think about what you're doing with your life— selling your days doing oil company or hedge fund PR

30 years from now, on your deathbed, will you feel proud of it?
5533 2018-01-11 14:38:35 Ive only seen the WLC rules on screen during the broadcast but didnt include handwrapping. Traditionally (outside of WLC) a boxer CAN wrap their hands if they like. No hard objects or oil can be applied then. Just patti (bandage and tape) as thin or thick as you like.
5534 2018-01-11 14:38:33 Thinking of starting my own car minor maintenance service.
I'll change your break pads & rotors, change your oil, change a tire, etc. For the price of parts plus a Little Caesars pizza.
Plus I'll teach you how to do it all.
5535 2018-01-11 14:38:27 Separately: Goldman Sachs in a note today summarizes their energy conference, saying most oil companies "emphasized the importance of discipline," saying cash flows from higher prices should be used to "enhance company value rather than" spending more cash. #OOTT

5538 2018-01-11 14:38:07 All I’m saying is you bang on about Manchester United being the biggest club in the world surely you couldn’t attract a bigger and better striker than Hernandez. Dropping your standards a bit low in my eyes just buzzing for big oil to get back
5539 2018-01-11 14:38:06 Predictions for 2018:
Dow: 25,350
S&P: 2750
10-year treasury: 2.41%
Bitcoin: $800
Oil: $55
Can't wait to be totally wrong!

5541 2018-01-11 14:37:50 Norway is a rich country due to North Sea oil, but electricity is not "near free".

Norway's domestic electricity prices are not that different to UK's.
5542 2018-01-11 14:37:50 @AshWebsterFBN @Varneyco @LizMacDonaldFOX Re: De @BilldeBlasio  - not to mention if he goes and sues the oil companies for this nonsense, doesn't this effect those that own shares in the companies? (thinking 401ks, IRAs, etc)

5545 2018-01-11 14:37:31 Several people have come intonthe store this week asking for cannabis oil and cigarette papers.
And like, did some laws change here while i wasn't looking?
5546 2018-01-11 14:37:28 Dependiente del Estado son las tarifas y el precio del combustible.Las tarifas publicas no pesan mucho, lo q si es el combustible y AHI para mi es donde esta la queja mas genuina, en el precio del gas oil, pero hay q recordar q el pais es uno solo,hay q tener cuentas equilibradas

5548 2018-01-11 14:37:23 Such a shame BigPharma medicine dominates this country. Holistic medicine has so many non-toxic cures. High grade tea tree oil destroys strep bacteria.
5549 2018-01-11 14:37:16 Floridians remember how devastating oil spills are to our beaches. This move is likely meant to give oil-friendly Rick Scott political cover, given the strong environmental sentiment of Florida voters.

5557 2018-01-11 14:36:34 Few lines on oil will be of great help to me
5558 2018-01-11 14:36:25 With a 100’ wide solar panel array strip on our side of the wall we could end foreign oil imports and pay for the wall, and sell energy to Mexico so that they would actually pay for the wall. If you sell power cheaper than anyone else your customer base will be limitless #wall
5559 2018-01-11 14:36:24 - the lingering smell of the anise oil from the spice cookies I baked last weekend that greets me every time I enter my apartment after work

5561 2018-01-11 14:36:04 You can still buy your milk and olive oil like this at the wonderful Goods Shed farmers' market in #Canterbury. Wish others would follow.

5564 2018-01-11 14:35:50 It's Thursday. Drink some water. Don't drink oil.
5565 2018-01-11 14:35:44 Motorists should brace themselves for a petrol hike next month as oil prices continue to rise. #votfmnews

5569 2018-01-11 14:35:09 What he is saying is pouring boiling oil in the mouth and ears of Shudra and cutting of their tounge for even giving an advice to Brahmin is matter of relative morality and not absolute cruelty.
Anyone defending manusmriti is no better then Manu as portrayed in that book.

5576 2018-01-11 14:34:13 The other day I went to a vitamin store and a clerk I couldn’t see asked what I was looking for I asked for “jo-joba” oil and she sprang up next to me out of nowhere horror movie style and shouted
“ITS PRONOUNCED HO-HOBA”
I ran.
5577 2018-01-11 14:34:10 You're wrong on this. We need offshore drilling. Texas has offshore drilling and great fishing and great beaches. Stop acting like a Democrat. We have to have our own oil not Arab oil!!!
5578 2018-01-11 14:34:04 If you don’t oil your locs with castor oil wyd?
5579 2018-01-11 14:34:03 For soft silky hair, massage strands with coconut oil 2-3 times a week!

5582 2018-01-11 14:33:58 Our Hempworx CBD Oil products are flying off the shelves!!! Who's ready to feel better???
5583 2018-01-11 14:33:53 Thank you Richard for this update...please keep them coming...esp oil and gold
5584 2018-01-11 14:33:53 As the polls close like a casket on truth devoured. A silent play in the shadow of power. A spectacle monopolized. The camera's eyes on choice disguised. Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil? Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil? /Rage
5585 2018-01-11 14:33:42 I love my vegetable oil milling lecturer, the only lecturer made our life so easy. May god bless her 
5586 2018-01-11 14:33:40 .@randrewwhite says there can be safe fracking, and this is important for Texas, which has an economy dependent on oil and gas. Still, he said, this is a local control issue as well. #ttevents
5587 2018-01-11 14:33:27 But I'm sure you feel that a bunch of oil rigs off the Outer Banks will be a beautiful sight right?
5588 2018-01-11 14:33:26 Hey, this snake oil doesn't work after all?!?!
5589 2018-01-11 14:33:24 @realDonaldTrump Lance this. Oil and tell us the TRUTH about OBAMA Intel agencies abuses. Then maybe we can move forward. @RandPaul @Jim_Jordan @DevinNunes @ChuckGrassley @NewHopeReece

5592 2018-01-11 14:32:10 Ohhh... Gas and oil truck... No idea what the purpose is but I'm sure it's taking the place of something probably important.  Lol
5593 2018-01-11 14:32:07 .@funder: 

Are you paying enough attention to the Mercers and Kochs and their common overlap (Oil), who’ve propped up #Trump? No.

Are you advocating working in concert with the other nations where the funders stoke nationalism to keep oil safe? No.
5594 2018-01-11 14:32:06 Need a great reason to get off oil, look at the oil tanker with over a million barrels of oil in it, burning and leaking creating another disaster! Oil is the past, not the future!
5595 2018-01-11 14:31:59 Hilarious you and that phrase "get smart" is like water and oil... They don't mix at all
5596 2018-01-11 14:31:41 Think ima take my shorty to chuck e cheese tomorrow after this oil change. Mommy daughter time all weekend 
5597 2018-01-11 14:31:28 If it was true Scottish oil selling at more than since ‘15 I’d have heard it on @BBCScotlandNews near the top & on subsequent bulletins. That’s not the case so this cannot b true.
5598 2018-01-11 14:31:26 Anybody can dominate the world if you have a shit load of oil money pumping in through the doors everyday mate. No matter how high you fly, Utd will be Utd and that can't be changed. Noisy.

5600 2018-01-11 14:31:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, or American citizens.
5601 2018-01-11 14:31:07 Big Oil has pushed, and lobbied $billiins, an agenda to stifle, and end, innovation and clean energy...and supported environmentally hazardous extraction processes, etc. Also, huge environmental disasters have occurred. Many articles/studies/movies about all of this.
5602 2018-01-11 14:31:01 Oil spills do make it to other states shores, contaminated fish do swim to other states oceans,  and $$$ to clean up for all taxpayers. With red tide and the Okeechobee debacle, Florida doesn't need any other man-made disasters, that's for sure. I'd still worry, if I were you.

$10/bbl rise increases India's,CAD by US$8bn (0.3% of GDP) & the fuel oil subsidy by about US$2bn (0.08% of GDP) as per PPAC
10% rise to increase CP by ~25bp, a 30bp dent in GDP growth,if full cost is passed on!

5606 2018-01-11 14:30:47 Apparently, night shift didn’t filter the fry oil, which made one fryer throw and error (bc they do that if you don’t clean them), and it appears they couldn’t reset it, so they drained the oil (idk why?) and LET IT COOL IN THE FILTER OVERNIGHT. I HAVE TO CLEAN THIS OUT NOW. :D
5607 2018-01-11 14:30:46 im in at 93 too just wish i wasnt greedy waiting for that 75, thought it was going to bust down then shoot up
5608 2018-01-11 14:30:42 Our biggest industries in Scotland are: banking, finance services, construction, education, entertainment, biotechnology, transport equipment, oil & gas, renewable energy, whisky and tourism. How can you say we can't be independent if we have all these industries which create job
5609 2018-01-11 14:30:31 Get an oil diffuser. I put eucalyptus oil in mine at night & my nose thanks me
5610 2018-01-11 14:30:28 Only 5 percent of @Reuters respondents think #oil prices will average more than $75 in 2018 or more than $85 in 2019.

5612 2018-01-11 14:30:01 I seriously doubt if you are "stupid", sir.   The thing to look for is their hedged oil to be extracted % for 2018 and compare to Anadarko's (which is -0-%) in a currently rising market.
5613 2018-01-11 14:29:59 She got lost and ran out of gas. It happens. When I went to get her and fill up her tank/add oil, she started crying. I took her home to make her some soup and a sandwich. She threatened to kidnap my cat multiple times (he IS a handsome kitty, but still). cont.-

5616 2018-01-11 14:29:27 @realDonaldTrump just a suggestion, apply a tax /fee to the oil companies allowed to drill off shore and subsidize  health care and VA
5617 2018-01-11 14:29:26 I guess I’ll get a oil change while I’m out 
5618 2018-01-11 14:29:18 lmaoo why do i constant look like an oil spill
5619 2018-01-11 14:29:06 Someone to take my car in for oil change. Someone to get my water when I leave it in the kitchen and it's dark and scary. Cuddles. Someone to cook for so I don't eat a meal for 4 alone. Workout partner. Someone to tell me I'm pretty when I'm sad. Someone to tell when I'm happy.
5620 2018-01-11 14:28:44 Article is misleading b/c
1) unemployment has been on the decline since after the recession in 08 back when TRUMP didn't believe the same bureau of stats
2) Deregulation to drill for oil with the exception that none of the coastal states want it and FL is unfairly exempt

5625 2018-01-11 14:28:19 @NYCMayorsOffice will sue big oil for climate change. When @BilldeBlasio give up big SUVs for travel? Commrade deBlasio???
5626 2018-01-11 14:28:17 Ya think! Obviously he doesn't want offshore drilling which is a bad idea by the way, spoiling his view at his tacky Maro-Largo. Oil is the Past! Renewables and Sustainable Energies are the Future.
5627 2018-01-11 14:28:14 Maybe he has engine oil in the bag and is topping it up?
5628 2018-01-11 14:28:14 @SenatorTimScott @LindseyGrahamSC  Great job allowing oil drilling of the coasts of sc— now you’ve helped ruin the coasts and businesses will suffer from the lack of tourism!

5631 2018-01-11 14:27:59 @FordServiceCA I am trying to contact FORD to change oil. No luck. I wrote to them using their website, tried to communicate with them on the phone, amy answered my call she was SO RUDE. Ford dealers do not have to provide services to Ford owners she says. OK. no problem.

5646 2018-01-11 14:26:44 Realist shit I ever read: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ? 
5647 2018-01-11 14:26:38 Can confirm your observation.  My Texas daughter and her family work at oil camp in Indonesia and she reports that employees there from various parts of the British Empire are visibly aghast when a microwave is used to heat water for tea.

5657 2018-01-11 14:25:28 @foxandfriends Bertalino is an idiot. Under Obama ecomonic recovery was anemic at best and he stifled an economy based on fossil fuels so much it choked investments. Our country runs on oil and coal. Everything else is a derivative such as the delivery of goods to consumers!

5666 2018-01-11 14:24:33 I used to think that but the more I look, the more I like Russia. They really did do lots of good economic reform. 13% flat income tax. 20% corp. Lowest debt in G20. 6th most FX reserves in the world (after sanctions, Syria & oil crash)
5667 2018-01-11 14:24:32 The oil industry by far has caused the most damage. Not only from the consumption of oil but by also stopping people from creating better solutions. It is a beginning of a movement that needs to start.

5690 2018-01-11 14:21:15 Ever notice that when the Post Fairness Act "news" applauds new jobs created- or purported to lament recent job losses- most often it is in the Oil&Gas industry? 

Amazing how a "deregulated" Free Press appears as "rigged" as the "fourth branch" of Government Trump has described.
5691 2018-01-11 14:21:09 Pop a bit of coconut oil in there.  it might not 'hydrate' you, per se, but it's a good way to add extra good things :)
5692 2018-01-11 14:21:02 You said we are dependent on countries that hate us. I pointed out that most of our imports come from Canada (and Latin America), who don’t “hate” us by any stretch. We get relatively little of our oil from Saudi Arabia.
5693 2018-01-11 14:20:53 There's no "Kirkuk-Ceyhan" pipeline operating anymore, as Iraqi government does not export Kirkuk oil through the KRG-built pipeline.

5720 2018-01-11 14:17:39 2018 may be difficult for consumers. Higher rates means no more home refi's to boost consumer spend. Same off higher inflation/oil/CC payments/loans.

5757 2018-01-11 14:11:53 do you mix the oil with anything or just use straight oil?

5. Spending in rural, housing and MSME- for creating jobs.

5897 2018-01-11 13:56:33 International prices of crude oil continue to remain elevated, around US$ 65 per barrel, which is the biggest risk to our balance of payments. Quick fixes may provide temporary relief but cannot resolve the underlying structural problems #lka

5907 2018-01-11 13:55:29 That's true. The maritimes are another neglected region of the country. What is not true is is oil and gas just fund Alberta. It is and will be for the foreseeable future an important component of trade you know currency coming in. Maybe we shouldn't be building vehicles either

6007 2018-01-11 13:44:24 Don't see why they would, plastic is made from oil with other additives. Don't see why the don't reverse the process, get the oil (actually diesel) back and sell it back to the refinery. The remaining stuff after reclaiming the oil is clumps of carbon/dirt

6010 2018-01-11 13:43:59 But doesn’t each coastal state have a say in whether or not they will allow off shore drilling? Not even sure why it’s needed when USA is second in world in oil production behind Saudi Arabia

6048 2018-01-11 13:39:47 My throat is so scratchy and my stomach is upset. I should probablyyyyyyy take my cbd oil daily like I'm supposed to
6049 2018-01-11 13:39:36 That place is a gift from god. We need a date to the farmers market for kombucha and CBD oil and thento upper crust for pie!
6050 2018-01-11 13:39:32 I make soap and lotion from scratch with natural essentials like coconut oil, shea butter, lavender, etc.
6051 2018-01-11 13:39:11 Happens even to exp'd sailors when fatigued/distracted, i.e. Admiralty case of Gulf of MX oil platform svc vessel. Vessel had 4 crew - 2 on / 2 off - it was xmas, 1st mate lonely, went topside to wheelhouse & left hatch open. W/strong following seas, vessel was lost in < 1 hr.
6052 2018-01-11 13:39:04 Pharmaceutical company ownership of lawmakers,is the beginning of the opioid epidemic. Mary Jane has a bad wrap, so the local cops can own the teenagers. Who allows Cartel to supply the US ? Taxing local growers is more profitable,than oil.
6053 2018-01-11 13:38:40 Please be aware to share accurate information, Boston Mass General Cardiac rehab clinic advised me after Open Heart surgery NEVER ingest Coconut oil due to the trans fats content. People should use Veg or rapeseed oil to cook with for health reasons!

6058 2018-01-11 13:38:02 Why do you think we buddy up to Saudi Arabia and overlook all of their human right transgressions? They heavily influence OPEC to keep oil prices artificially low which affects Venezuela oil. If we paid the true market price, many of this countries would be doing better

6064 2018-01-11 13:37:10 I have been wondering about quite a few wealthy GOP donors who have financial interests in oil and gas industry—pipelines, refineries, etc. Oil, Arctic drilling, tar sand refineries, fracking, Zinke’s opening up US coastlines—while we have a glut of oil and gas right now.

6068 2018-01-11 13:36:44 You can't be that stupid.  You don't drill there for the same reason you don't drill in Kansas there's no oil down there.  What did you think, just because you you drill a hole 5 miles down you always get oil?? 
6069 2018-01-11 13:36:17 I can't speak greek, how would they take to an American asking very loudly why everything has lamb in it and complaining about olive oil
6070 2018-01-11 13:36:09 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
6071 2018-01-11 13:36:07 Go EV and never look back, who cares about the price of oil?  Watch how they tax EV drivers for lack of Gas Tax revenue, in WV they quadrupled the registration fee.
6072 2018-01-11 13:35:56 PETGAS will reduce time and costs for oil producers to determine whether such gas fields are economically viable. At the end of 2017 we were pleased to welcome @nexenenergy to the project team, joining EBN and @PDO_OM #JIP #technology #project
6073 2018-01-11 13:35:54 higher rates in 2018 will leave many consumers w/ less money to spend. Home refs will cease. CC bills are higher. Inflation/COL/Oil higher. Consumers already drowning in debt. Some help on tax relief. Does it net out or drown them out?

6075 2018-01-11 13:35:43 But majority of bald spots are reversible, except of they're genetic. You'd think to start doing scalp massages with growth stimulating agents e.g. Castor oil, rosemary oil etc. But the best thing to do is leave your hair alone, especially the bald spot for about a month and see
6076 2018-01-11 13:35:42 Honestly, what makes the most long term sense is give the same kind of incentives and tax breaks that oil companies get to SUV manufactures to come up with extraordinarily energy efficient and reliable SUVs.

6083 2018-01-11 13:35:19 US crude oil inventory declined by 4.9 million barrels in the week ended  Jan 05. Moreover, gasoline stockpiles rose 4.1 million barrels for the  week, while distillate stockpiles added 4.3 million barrels.
6084 2018-01-11 13:35:18 そんなこと言ってくる教師おるか？
6085 2018-01-11 13:35:11 OPEC led production cut has already worked well for tightening oil  market, though part of its impact has hindered by soaring U.S.  production that has gained about 16% in last 1-Year.

6087 2018-01-11 13:35:05 According to my research,choii.  Haha.Leaving a clay mask overnight is not good for your skin. The effect may not be direct but over time your skin can become drier since the clay mask strip all of the good oil for your skin. It's better to use a sheet mask for an overnight use.
6088 2018-01-11 13:35:02 So oil companies are to blame for climate change and poverty? Talking separate issues. Let me rephrase, how many applauding drink water out of a plastic bottle?
6089 2018-01-11 13:34:31 I am feeling very sad for the people in California this morning. Fires in 2017, mudslides now. Praying for those missing. At the other coast, we are experiencing fog! 70's -80's today and a lot of talk going on about the exempt oil drilling for the state of Florida Waa..whiners
6090 2018-01-11 13:34:25 Government can help a little but only on an island with low import/export it can shape it and then... there comes a natural disaster.

6097 2018-01-11 13:33:51 Try argan oil or castor oil. Castor oil is better but it’s a lot thicker and will leave you kind of sticky until it all sinks in but it’s worth it.

6100 2018-01-11 13:33:14 Problem is that EIA counts field conde as part of their oil calcs. Conde isnt oil and doesnt get the same pricing. Most recent growth is from “oil” with API above 45.
6101 2018-01-11 13:33:13 Problem is news is about events and environmental issues are mostly gradual, with a few exceptions such as oil spills.

6145 2018-01-11 13:28:39 All about inflation expectations and oil price is my feel. If you look back at 4Q14 when rates and usdjpy really synched up it feels like a very similar economic period to now. The only difference was which way oil prices were going...very simplistically:-)
6146 2018-01-11 13:28:29 De Blasio is chief Green Grafter -- he takes from profitable oil  companies and gives to his bodies in NY Corrupt Green Industries.

this market at this peak is not for longterm investors, ONLY for traders.

just remember when everyone was calling for $oil, 10-20 after it already went from triple digits to below 30, is a same scenario just doing the opposite.
its a rigged market!!!

6159 2018-01-11 13:26:58 Why do we need to violate any states rights and wishes to allow offshore drilling? We are not in an energy crisis, oil prices are low, and renewable energy are becoming better and more affordable.
6160 2018-01-11 13:26:52 While it burns more fuel than all of Africa combined.  Wake up New York,  oil companies don't consume oil, people do.
6161 2018-01-11 13:26:51 Oils have a basic chemistry, they separate. Using an oil based cleaner will help moisturizer your face while removing the bad oils already deposited from your pores.
6162 2018-01-11 13:26:39 It's honestly a struggle I'll never overcome, no amount of castor oil can make them as thick as I would like them. And I don't even want em that thick  I just want normal.
6163 2018-01-11 13:26:20 Total SA sold AB assets due to uncertain NDP political climate. Total SA immediately, June 2017 invested $4.3B into more politically certain IRAN. Please don’t let Socialist apologists tell you Notley is a victim of low oil prices.

6168 2018-01-11 13:25:40 As the world moves away from oil, plastics will become more expensive (currently a by-product).  May jumping on a bandwagon, to claim credit.

6170 2018-01-11 13:25:07 Personally i would wash his face with hot oil.
6171 2018-01-11 13:24:47 ACV can help with so many things, I can’t even get into it. But as far as the oily skin you want an OIL-BASED cleaner. Even if the oil production has stopped you want to make sure your face isn’t thrown out of wack.

#1 China installing charging infrastructure faster. #Shenzhen alone spent USD 100M vs #Germany USD 200M;

#2 China #EV car sharing (#Didi), #trucks & #buses;

#3 China Policy 2 capture auto manufacturing & reduce oil reliance.

6244 2018-01-11 13:15:34 I saw that on the Iran deal. He’s still going after the regime, not sending them cash and putting their allies in the Administration, so that’s a plus. 
100 days? Irrelevant. By year’s end, the Obama mandate was gone too, and ISIS smashed, and oil exploration approved also.

6254 2018-01-11 13:14:46 I'm not talking about Obama. Trump hasn't helped, in fact the forces that he is backing in Syria let a bunch of ISIS out of Raqqa who then escaped to Turkey and other who went to fight in Abu Kamal. Just so they could go and take oil fields before SAA could lib. their own lands

6303 2018-01-11 13:08:30 Maybe the oil companies  should stop supplying New York State. Let’s see how long they can last without oil and gas. This is a ridiculous lawsuit.
6304 2018-01-11 13:08:21 It seems like there's been a fairly obvious answer staring us straight in the face for decades: Just transition to 100% renewable energy for everyone. No new coal, oil or gas projects anywhere.

6319 2018-01-11 13:05:47 People kept telling me to put coconut oil on my baby’s head 
6320 2018-01-11 13:05:46 You are very correct. 
Must people think because we export crude oil and the way our govt squander the money made people feel Nigeria is a rich country. 
Just compare our budget with other countries with far less population and you'd be ashamed of how poor we really are.
6321 2018-01-11 13:05:44 Who is going to have to bail them out.
Like the last time SNP asking London to bail them out when the oil prices collapsed
6322 2018-01-11 13:05:44 EU NEEDS TO INVADE @IraqiGovt AND ARREST @HaiderAlAbadi FOR CURROPTION AND THOSE WHO ARE INVOLVED W/HIM. TAKE THE OIL AND GIVE THEPPL THEIR SHARE OF THE LAND WEALTH, PLACE A NEW GOV IN PLACE AND STOP HELPING THESE CORRUPTED POLITICIANS FILL THEIR POCKETS!!!!!!

6328 2018-01-11 13:05:23 I guess there wasn't any oil under the land.

6333 2018-01-11 13:04:53 Probably a combination of cars, power plants, but also ropy state of the region's oil refineries, churning out poor quality fuel. Refineries are upgrading, but Kyrgyzstan's new Junda refinery, on stream in 2014, has struggled to source crude oil due to trade issues, I was told.

6338 2018-01-11 13:03:35 At the shop getting oil changed, they have "Stairway to Heaven" playing in the background and now all im thinking about is "why did they always use this as the last song for 6-8th grade school dances?"

Love the French Girl skincare essential oil fragrances! Rose is my fave!

6343 2018-01-11 13:03:23 What is the big deal? All the other states down here already have Oil Rigs. You need to ask the governor and Senator Rubio your question.
6344 2018-01-11 13:03:08 Just transition to 100% renewable energy for everyone. No new coal, oil or gas projects anywhere.
6345 2018-01-11 13:02:44 Agreed! I went to get my tonsillectomy consultation and then they found my nodule and I told him about all of my other symptoms. I’ve done vitamin e oil but haven’t tried the pill yet. Thank you

6349 2018-01-11 13:02:32 omg me too!! I made some last night for the first time in years! i put it on a pan in the oven. but you can fry it in the pan to make it krispy! you don’t need oil bc of the fat in the bacon (save the grease!)

6354 2018-01-11 13:01:12 NYC is suing big oil over #climatechange. Every city should join this suit. We have to get #OFFFossilFuels and on renewable energy. #ThursdayThoughts
6355 2018-01-11 13:01:07 Could you please offer a mix and match list of lobbyist jobs available to them. Perhaps offer a prize to the person who best guesses who goes to which lobbying firm/pharmaceutical company/agribusiness/oil company.
6356 2018-01-11 13:00:51 @Bamabroker @silkdynastystx  Note: EURUSD up 70 pips. Gold barely up 2$. Oil touched 64$. NY traders will Wack it all down.
6357 2018-01-11 13:00:48 This sounds like a song from Spinal Tap.
6358 2018-01-11 13:00:46 We also LOVE how SNP voters think that we believe Oil Revenue is NOT controlled in Westminster:

Nah, we just believe they don’t want it back to build a divide between the people of the UK

How could you put faith in a party for independence when it can’t even get back it’s oil

6377 2018-01-11 12:58:23 Maybe the oil and gas companies should turn off the tap and see how it goes?

6379 2018-01-11 12:58:20 Never seen so many high quality bottoming patterns across entire hard commodity stock space.  Base metals have lead for sure, but now good bottoms in uranium, oil, and even gold/silver.  Early days get long & sit imo.
6380 2018-01-11 12:58:20 The fixing of every day petroleum price by the oil companies based on intl oil price is a fraud played on people. Very few notice it, just slow (petro) poisoning.

6391 2018-01-11 12:56:43 I’m a Christian and I totally agree with giving offering to help further ministries. But the fact that this lady says you should specifically send money to HER rather than your local church or charity, is the definition of a snake oil salesman. What a joke.
6392 2018-01-11 12:56:40 I worked at a small store as well and we would absolutely sell single sticks of butter for $1.99 (but the base of this butter wasn't dairy, it was an oil blend so it didn't have to be refrigerated) but yeah people buy it to use on popcorn because it's perfect for that 
6393 2018-01-11 12:56:32 A deep fat fryer is cheating, should be a pot of boiling oil on an open fire.

6396 2018-01-11 12:56:17 Careful, Global warming is a term used by the same type of people who call oil sands “tar sands” 

As I’ve stated before.. no one debating Climate Change.. it’s who’s making a profit over hyperbole. 

Remember when pop-science use to talk about sun phases and planet cooling?
6397 2018-01-11 12:56:14 Mmm where does plastic come from, that would be oil. Can it be turned back into oil. Er yes it can. 1kg= 1 ltr of oil, general rule of thumb. Well what are you waiting for....

6399 2018-01-11 12:56:10 Tip for the bakers on the tl.

If your chocolate cake isn't moist enough, DO NOT ADD OIL. Just pour some liquid cream or milk in and glaze. Not too much though, cause you don't want it to get soggy.
6400 2018-01-11 12:56:09 Wasn’t there something about US oil production dropping last week?

6429 2018-01-11 12:50:57 To those who aren’t quite up on facts.(usually braindead Leftists). If there was NO Oil Sands development the watersheds would still be polluted by the “Tar Sands”. Leaking to the surface for millennia this area has always been polluted.
6430 2018-01-11 12:50:56 Trumps Sec of Interior Ryan Zinke is a former NAVY Seal. He is running the Interior department like a military commander where his primary mission is to cover America’s heartlands and coastlines with oil and gas

6432 2018-01-11 12:50:49 I love reading the feeds of "Day Traders" that claim to have been calling $60+ oil when it was in the mid to high forties. COU**bullshit**GH
6433 2018-01-11 12:50:42 $usd is down that's why $oil is up
6434 2018-01-11 12:50:21 There’s not much data to support that claim. But I have seen first hand the scores of dead and dying wildlife who are victims of an oil spill for years after the accident. Human communities suffer as well as thoroughly documented after the Exxon Valdez and now Deepwatrr Horizon.

6452 2018-01-11 12:47:29 Read the article. This was GE's  attempt to preserve their company. Sector of lost job is from wind power. Trump is powered by coal and oil. #TaxCutandJobsAct

6458 2018-01-11 12:46:54 Was able in #FinanceBill Committee today to again raise the issue of the phantom oil and gas ambassador promised by David Cameron two years ago this month but yet to materialise. 
The Minister committed to investigating and getting back to me.
6459 2018-01-11 12:46:26 My whole next paycheck is going to a new mirror, new tires, an oil change, and now new brake lights. Love adulting.

6462 2018-01-11 12:46:02 UPDATE: Tullow farmdown of 21.5% of their 33.3% stake in four oil wells will be worth $210mn in cash and $700mn in deferred payment. Deal expected to be wound up by July this year. 

CNOOC and Total are the buyers

6466 2018-01-11 12:45:53 Jean it diffuses essential oils in the air. You put water & a few drops of oil in it. It’s like a humidifier with a scent! 
6467 2018-01-11 12:45:48 Plastic derived from oil is a money maker for fossil fuel producers like Ineos. They have a vested interest in maintaining their ‘market share’ in those products. The struggle to move to biodegradable and sustainable ‘plastics’ as well as to renewables is hampered by their lobby.

6477 2018-01-11 12:45:22 At some point oil stocks are going to react to the ever increasing price of oil.  Most have been red everyday this week.

6488 2018-01-11 12:43:41 I have VBI.  After a stroke i was left with my right hand that shakes terribly. People looks at me strangely as if I am a alcoholic or a druggie.  Marijuana oil takes it away and I feel myself again. I have heard of a guy healed of cancer after doctors gave him 3 months.
6489 2018-01-11 12:43:40 My train rn needs oil, every time the carriage moves it starts sounding like a wailing child and it’s mildly terrifying…

6502 2018-01-11 12:41:55 Did he get a lifetime supply of oil for the Iranians?
6503 2018-01-11 12:41:52 Well, perhaps all countries with huge net revenues from the export of oil that can afford to be self righteous could adopt such incentives
6504 2018-01-11 12:41:45 I need to let it grow long enough so it doesn't look so scraggly. I could also use products like beard oil to help with that.

6511 2018-01-11 12:41:17 Bunker fuels are burned in ships only. There are a small handful of plants that may burn low sulfur #6 fuel oil, but that is rare. Your original comment was that the majority of US oil is used to create electricity. Patently false. Go do some research at the EIA website.

6536 2018-01-11 12:37:54 i don’t care abt politicals I don’t care who stops it! I’m against drilling off Florida coast. there’s plenty of oil, there are so many barges w/barrels lined up they can’t even dock, we don’t need drilling off West coast of Florida or any other of our shores for that matter
6537 2018-01-11 12:37:42 pake face oil

6557 2018-01-11 12:35:05 This is great!! No need to buy overseas. Plenty of oil right here. Alot cheaper prices and alot more jobs.

6575 2018-01-11 12:33:07 For what we need, oil bubblers work fine when combined with sufficient taps along the manifold and a steady hand on the taps. Wouldn't cope with significant suckback, but as you know, sprung valves don't work either. It'll be interesting to see what others do.
6576 2018-01-11 12:33:02 Of course! I'll get the proportions from my pops, but it's grain alcohol (everclear), simple syrup, and anise oil for flavoring.

6738 2018-01-11 12:06:01 Pretty much all good news from clinic today, at last.

Right eye looks superb, can have the oil out whenever I'm ready to have surgery done. Pressure 24, over normal but not dangerous, can stop the bloody diamox at last.

Have a cataract developing, but no need to treat it yet.
6739 2018-01-11 12:05:58 Oil price (Brent on ICE) is within striking distance of $70. Trump proves economy is politics, not economics. Inflation is coming. We'll see the Global Inflation, as we saw the Global Recession a decade ago. US economy should run fast to get ahead of inflation. No time to let up.
6740 2018-01-11 12:05:56 i wonder if waiters ever think im strange for patting the dressing or oil in my salads with tissue. 
6741 2018-01-11 12:05:42 Drill baby drill but don't drain all of the oil wells completely dry. The world will probably always or for at least the foreseeable future need a small amount of petroleum products to keep the world's vehicles & other machinery & equipment running.

6806 2018-01-11 11:54:49 It all seems too little, too late. If we'd been investing in green fuels etc. at the same levels of programmes like trident, we'd be much closer by now.

6871 2018-01-11 11:43:27 Agreed a cafetière can be a bit too full on (in a dirty way) as the filter is quite coarse. The steel filters for the aero press are finer and get you some where in between. Of course it depends what your preferences are. I like a clean cup but sometimes I want a bit of oil! 
6872 2018-01-11 11:43:15 If only we had more to fight the oil companies and save our children and grandchildren!   NY just filed a lawsuit to sue all the large oil companies for the damage they are doing to the world #climatechange.  Hopefully more states will save our country.

6937 2018-01-11 11:33:06 #joysms No nation has developed by exporting oil or gold. The Arabian countries are NOT DEVELOPED Nations. South Africa is developing because the gold/diamonds were used to develop a strong manufacturing & agricultural base

6943 2018-01-11 11:32:32 It looks like the oil market is taking a page from the $SPY bumpers. pop, hold  and repeat. $USO . No one questions this as manipulated. I love the argument that this is a free market. And it's so big that no one can manipulate it.
6944 2018-01-11 11:32:22 If @realDonaldTrump really wants to help the economy, then creating millions of  high paying oil & gas jobs is the answer. Not 155 Coal jobs.

6954 2018-01-11 11:31:05 Rising energy costs have more to do with rising oil price and the perils of burning a finite resource - plus we have a shocking housing stock in the UK compared to other northern European nations, with very poor insulation.

7000 2018-01-11 11:22:42 There is no cultural differences, it's consumers buying in Euros which has helped your nation and in a military alliance with 21 European Union nations. The desire for a United States of Europe is very much a minority opinion within EU.

7023 2018-01-11 11:18:19 Afghanistan -> Al Qaeda.
Iraq -> IS.
Libya/Syria -> ISIS.
Significantly causal.
Then we have the West's habit of overthrowing moderate governments in the Middle East in favour of extremists who are pliant in their oil policies.

7024 2018-01-11 11:18:16 Yes - read the piece
7025 2018-01-11 11:18:10 For me, literally just oil and salt and see if it needs any acid. Doll or fennel fronds good too but not essential!

7027 2018-01-11 11:18:04 come on data as oil is great analogy - it leaks, needs cleaning up, causes damage and you get fined :)

7031 2018-01-11 11:17:31 I own a Scion TC built in either Texas or Canada.  They fucked up when putting it together and put the rings in wrong.  It's been eating oil since day 1.  We just purchased a Subaru Forester.  100% build in Japan.  I am so happy with it.  Japan never stopped being GREAT!!
7032 2018-01-11 11:17:16 Bar Juve you have to play for a club with blood money from dirty oil deals/Russian mafias to make the team of the year
7033 2018-01-11 11:17:11 Personally I think it’s so stupid. It may be good for generating headlines and demonising fossil fuels (propaganda) but people don’t burn fossil fuels because oil companies might have ‘lied’ about climate science, they (and the city) burn them because they’re incredibly useful.
7034 2018-01-11 11:16:53 That's a logical thing to do, but JZ and logic.......oil and water
7035 2018-01-11 11:16:32 An essential oil is the “essence” of a flower, leaf or root, extracted very delicately to a plant-based oil or steam distillation. They have history of use spanning over 5000 years, dating back to pre-Egyptian civilisations for their aromatic qualities & powerful health benefits.
7036 2018-01-11 11:16:16 Good grief, what are drilling rigs? Things of beauty? The oil and gas industry tries everything to drive people away from clean energy
7037 2018-01-11 11:15:48 Absolutely.  We are building up to at least a taper tantrum (now called rate rage?), key is whether CBs press on with cold turkey a la late 07 or relent a la Sep 13. Probably the latter

Anyway, there are so many more bricks in the wall of fear now, eg. oil

7168 2018-01-11 10:55:24 @realDonaldTrump Higher oil due to Venezuela or any other nation isn't going to fly for the economy.  It will crash the economy.  That's not good.
7169 2018-01-11 10:54:43 This is misleading people. Plastic is being made daily. It is a by product of refining oil & not connsumable by the Planet. The only way to stop it is to stop refining oil. Be honest about being #plasticfree
7170 2018-01-11 10:54:38 I lived by the Body Shop, you can get their stuff at TJ maxx for $10. The Vitamin E one is good for dry skin and the tea tree oil one is good for blemishes

7181 2018-01-11 10:52:37 I like this one - it's interesting that the oil rich arab states have an obesity problem, but not surprising.

7223 2018-01-11 10:45:04 seen the price of oil recently?  Freeing developing nations from the tyranny of oil, when they have massive renewable resources themselves doesn't strike me as energy colonialism - but clearly you enjoy choking on smog and PM10 particles?

7263 2018-01-11 10:38:15 Surely factoring in the oil price in any future Indyref debate is just careless. It’s far too volatile, on the way out and the optics aren’t great if we are to paint ourselves as a green economy. Decommissioning the apparatus is more of a burden.

7589 2018-01-11 09:42:20 I’m much more interested in hearing how you are going to push back against Trump’s plan to allow oil drilling in NC coastal waters. I’m interested in what you’re doing for NC. i don’t care about your Instagram photos.

7599 2018-01-11 09:41:07 The day started with me knocking over one of those oily room scents  which resulted in about ~500ml of oil on my floor, my clothes and several bags. I'm trying to look at the positive things: I now smell like Christmas

7605 2018-01-11 09:40:47 Something that's been bothering me a lot is how trump is grouping nuclear energy with dirty energy industries (coal/oil/ect). Trump says he's in favor of nuclear yet he is absolutely destroying the rep by doing this.

7616 2018-01-11 09:37:32 Make oil much more expensive, and there will be less waste. It is ludicrous to pump oil out of the ground to make a single use plastic cup.
7617 2018-01-11 09:37:19 Vzla had issues before the oil price drop and the reliance on oil is because they did not diversify the economy + made it more reliant on imports, notably food. The regime did that. I notice you sidestep Morales' push against term limits.

Then look at #RPT with similar valuation/jurisdiction with $30m cash, 2,800boepd, no debt and also upcoming drills
7626 2018-01-11 09:34:24 I love this. High time the world puts big oil out of business and leaves the remaining fossil fuels safely underground.

7735 2018-01-11 09:17:00 They were always called oligarchs in Britain until recently. The media like to call them oil magnates, billionaires and critics of Putin now.

How they became so rich is totally ignored.
7736 2018-01-11 09:16:32 Norway is only 15th largest producer of oil in world.  Largest are Russia, Saudi Arabia and USA, all of which fit the "petrostate" label far better in that wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few.  Norway has spent its oil money on physical and social infrastructure.

7773 2018-01-11 09:08:46 I completely agree that we should ethically use our resources. However very credible climate science suggests burning fossil fules (and providing it) is completely unethical. Sure the world runs on oil. Buy what if in the future the world ran on Canadian batteries?

7829 2018-01-11 08:55:21 Well, the federal tax money that the oil companies will pay when they start to drill off the California coast should offset this right?  Especially since the east coast states won’t have any drilling off their shores.

7832 2018-01-11 08:53:48 So from my understanding the pricing of fuel jumped from about N87 to N145 to enable the government to refurbish the oil refineries we have in this country. We still don’t have one oil refinery.

7928 2018-01-11 08:35:14 I too am trying to be respectful, however oil is simply not necessary for economic growth. Alternative energy and transportation allows Canada to become self reliant. And a self reliance on renewable resources. Look at Saudi Arabia, they are spending billions on diversification.

8017 2018-01-11 08:20:44 That’s more reason to leave oil behind. I’m basing my predictions on social trends. The simple fact that there’s a rising international stigma with using fossil fuels and further stigma on those who refuse to see problems with sticking to dirty energy.

Btw, also the 1000s of tons of natural oil seepage into the ocean off Santa Barbara, California leaked for 100s of 1000s of years...??? Just a reality check...

8164 2018-01-11 07:53:37 It could have been the hub of the north sea oil industry. It was meant to be.
8165 2018-01-11 07:53:33 No it does'nt, And you should know better. Scotland is leading the way in renewables & has other sectors that we don't have control over as they are pillaged by the  Westminster establishment. It just so happens that oil is the biggest & most lucrative of them all.
8166 2018-01-11 07:53:29 Correct, the other similarly situated states must also be taken off the oil drilling table, in order for real  positive enviromental and ecological reinvesting here.

8285 2018-01-11 07:31:44 Palm oil market is global. The food industry continues to be the world's biggest consumer of palm oil representing over 71% of the global usage, biofuel industry some 16% and chemical industry over 11% (source: USDA).
8286 2018-01-11 07:30:46 Could it be true Mrs May that the extra £2bn you spoke about at PMQ's for Scotland was considerable less than the extra revenue you've gained by the oil prices going up. Scotland's oil .. don't you forget it ya tory git.
8287 2018-01-11 07:30:23 There's no option to RT this Tweet ##Pepsi is downright horrible beside paying off people to say sugar is fine which it causes Cancer plus cutting down the RAINFOREST for palm oil is So stupid I would never buy their products & I encourage you to Boycott
8288 2018-01-11 07:30:19 @GayPimp ask @Mothercouture if the store she works sells those oil vape cartridges? Need like two
8289 2018-01-11 07:29:39 Daily Flow @ContraAquam  Markets took a breath, with pullbacks on all major indicies.  Crude Oil inventory dropped  by 5M Barrels, yet the energy sector overall dropped by .15%.  @united jumped 6.72% on great December numbers.  @Kodak jumped >50%  as it dabbles in blockchain
8290 2018-01-11 07:29:05 Tories sussed out years ago in Scotland killing Scots steel ,coal ,ship building etc.. To cap it off draining off oil revenue to keep London quality street gang in their finery all enabled by the likes of miles Briggs
8291 2018-01-11 07:29:05 Your brother would not have been there in the first place if not for the Bush family ties to the oil industry, and Saddam's attempt of nationalizing the oil industry. Sorry for your loss, but the structures @GeorgeWBush__ complied w/ let him be killed.
8292 2018-01-11 07:28:53 Just finished watching lol
8293 2018-01-11 07:28:48 I just learned about all the benefits of Grapeseed oil and now I am rubbing it all over my body. A little hesitant to try it on my face but 
8294 2018-01-11 07:28:28 I think@of him more and more as a carnival con man. Carni Don the Con. He is always selling something that is just snake oil, always going on about things that are total lies. Always in your face saying the most outrageous BS
8295 2018-01-11 07:28:26 Reports of oil spill, Mt Keira Rd x Harry Graham Dr. RFS responding to scene. Use Caution if you are in the area.
8296 2018-01-11 07:27:53 I kept waiting for someone to do that. That is exactly what I would’ve done as soon as that POS got on my hood.
8297 2018-01-11 07:27:33 @drjkahn is a showman and snake oil salesman, COI with plant based.
8298 2018-01-11 07:26:29 @NTAGMN Why did NTAGMN suddenly change their topic from prospects of extractive sector to oil; developing downstream infrastructure & refineries they were not prepared for?
8299 2018-01-11 07:26:23 @Tesco But is all the packaging responsibly sourced and can it be recycled? And what about the ingredients, does it have ingredients in which effect animals e.g. palm oil?
8300 2018-01-11 07:26:20 Do NOT allow these filthy oil companies to drill anywhere, let alone CA coastline, are we all crazy? What year are we in..
8301 2018-01-11 07:26:17 @sandeepashar Sir, India's largest state owned oil marketing company is not employing any norms for posting competent Quality Control personnel at sensitive locations, even as oil adulteration mafia remains a multi crore rupee business
8302 2018-01-11 07:25:49 I still have the same bottle with about a cm of oil in that I did 3 years ago when I started my diet. I really must chuck it out. Frylight is the way forward 
8303 2018-01-11 07:25:48 Is it gonna be called 50 States Schuffle But does not included Puerto Rico or other territories unless they have oil or uranium
8304 2018-01-11 07:25:46 Hmm, not in Trump's gorgeous backyard view obviously. This however is suspiciously like the late Sen. Ted Kennedy & all of Kennedy clan but Joe K. III, viciously fighting the "Cape Wind" power proposal, which would've supplied 75% of that area's power, replacing oil/nat. gas!
8305 2018-01-11 07:25:38 And did you manage to ensure that @realDonaldTrump won’t have to worry about oil rigs impeding the view of the white and wealthy at Mar-a-Lago so that @POTUS can continue to make illegal $$$ there? Oh, and how is that @GOP cronyism working for everyone?
8306 2018-01-11 07:24:56 I love this Angela  it’s like an oil painting...very pretty

8308 2018-01-11 07:24:20 See, Nigeria is greatly blessed. What we have had in the last 3 decades is leadership deficiency. Can u imagine Kogi State alone has about 42 resources u can extract? Imagine if all of these potentials are fully explored in the many states of the Federation,why d fight over oil?
8309 2018-01-11 07:24:17 Have to wonder. Are you kompromat? Did you invest in Rosneft and Putin’s moves to control the world’s oil?
8310 2018-01-11 07:23:44 If that so just massage your body. Use essential oil if u have one. Did eating medicine for period pain will result in that

8313 2018-01-11 07:23:20 My point is that any of these actions will have equal and opposite reactions. Charge Mex more for oil & they charge us more for oil. Or invest in Pemex to reduce need for US oil. Border taxes go both ways, etc. Can’t be isolationist and demand things from other govs.  No leverage
8314 2018-01-11 07:22:35 just heard u saying you are for oil gas Big time. sigh we were on our way to becoming less dependent on them. fracking is causing more earthquakes, and our renewable energy programs are being thrown by wayside. i say put an oil platform out by winter white house.see how u like it
8315 2018-01-11 07:21:51 Oga owfar, we are not dummies. No oil gas supply is bad. You people just want to improve the demand of fuel since some of us have settled for Nepa light.

“@realDonaldTrump & I really want to grease the palms of our oily corporate comrades but Mar-a-Lago is off limits because oil rigs might impede @POTUS making illegal $ off his golf course plus we want to make sure @FLGovScott wins the senate cuz @GOP cronyism.”
8329 2018-01-11 07:20:19 I love chickens too.. :) black pepper and paprika sprinkled, glazed with olive oil, and chopped onions at its base. Couscous is awesome.. together with some of those nice mushroom sauce.

8337 2018-01-11 07:17:42 I salute the decision to allow people to import cooking oil, meat, soap, milk etc. Our retailers will be affected. They have always taken us for a ride.

Which, like, is an issue since I didn't consume pizza 
8341 2018-01-11 07:17:02 Bernie woke up the electorate. Look around. 

Hillary bored people and wants more war for oil. 

Dem policy is garbage. Just more corporate money backing the oligarchy.
8342 2018-01-11 07:16:56 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
8343 2018-01-11 07:16:47 Fed, prov excise taxes are fixed, so matters not if oil is $10 or $100, tax is the same.  Add local excise fixed $/l, add % HST,GST, CT....
8344 2018-01-11 07:16:45 I thought it was very interesting too - and the doctors were even surprised that something with high saturated fat could actually lower bad cholesterol and up the good stuff!! Coconut oil all the way!

8351 2018-01-11 07:15:45 The so called Indian oil baron is just a local Satrap of deep state @RoyalFamily, just like East India Company or Standard Oil's Rockefeller in USA and during WW2. Same people's @RockefellerFdn is setting up @ID2020 global ids to profit from murder and mayhem in WW3.

We realise it was just a pay cheque @vancole9 
8362 2018-01-11 07:12:50 We expect the JSE to open marginally lower (-0.3%) today, on account of the advance in Asian spot equity markets is showing signs of running out of steam.  We expect rising crude prices to continue to support the share prices of energy shares as US crude oil stockpiles fall.

8369 2018-01-11 07:11:38 Your job is to remove Zinke! He took tax payer $ for private jets, he has taken oil co kick backs, what kickbacks did he take to remove Florida? @SenFeinstein
8370 2018-01-11 07:11:36 And Trump complains about Latina women coming to USA to have their anchor babies and then he bitches about chain migration! He even got Zinke to exempt Florida coast from oil wells do he’d have unobstructed views; guess he’ll exempt Russian babies from chain migration policy too?

8396 2018-01-11 07:09:05 hi hello. don’t wash or wet your hair everyday so it’s oils balance, if you wash it every other day it works. also if you use a good and oily moisturizer, it will counteract your oily skin. your skin will start to not make as much oil if you are moisturized!!! <3

8408 2018-01-11 07:06:29 The importance of this extractive industry can never be overemphasized. Unfortunately we pay attention to oil only and neglect the potentials of the others like coal , zinc etc. If we'll tapped, the contributions to the national growth and employments are steadily guaranteed.
8409 2018-01-11 07:06:23 Olive oil worked for me.Wet your hair, apply a bit of olive oil all over the hair then wash your Afro like you normally would.
8410 2018-01-11 07:06:11 We can live without coconut oil - why try and make life more complicated than it already is?
8411 2018-01-11 07:05:45 it's the new oil to the extent that every leak fucks things up for other people

8546 2018-01-11 06:40:00 It really is not very progressive or even-handed to characterize all oil and gas drilling as “harmful.” Most, if not all, Washingtonians, rely on oil and gas to heat their homes, go to work, get to food and clothing, and more. We should do our fair share to produce them.

8564 2018-01-11 06:36:32 What, we don’t want to promote clean energy?  Wind and solar?  As usual, Trump wants to go backward.  Drill for more oil off our pristine coastal waters.  Support the coal industry for Christ’s sake.  This fool can be counted on every time to do the wrong thing, no exceptions!

8569 2018-01-11 06:35:07 That they are up to sue the oil companies it's maybe big news but the fact they are divest from fossil companies. It's even late. A lot of key investors have taken off their money for long.

8572 2018-01-11 06:34:21 I'm laughing too because they completely twisted my tweet. I didn't compare mayonnaise to the n word idk where that even came from lol i said hypothetically if a white person called a group of black ppl an oil spill ppl would jump down their throat
8573 2018-01-11 06:33:54 He’s trying to revive old industries instead of pushing clean and renewables. When we have another Deepwater Horizon oil spill, or further pollute the air with black coal smoke, we’ll have him to thank for it. Money over everything I guess.

8612 2018-01-11 06:28:18 Losses are a lot more than that.  The efficiency of thermal power ranges from around 31% for oil to around 43% for natural gas.  Line and transformer losses may be around 10%.  And now that I've got the bit between my teeth I'm not going to be able to let it go!

8712 2018-01-11 06:11:42 California needs revenue from oil to pay welfare cost for welfare using immigrants. Only a STUPID person cuts off a revenue stream. Speaking of "cut off" Gov  Brown wants the next governor to optionally reduce pension payments. I guess to buy more immigrant votes. Dems do that.

8742 2018-01-11 06:06:46 Yeah right ! When and how much did individual taxes go up? You’re making shit up again. And I guess you must of been asleep when 26,000 jobs showed up, and the unemployment rate dropped, and investment is blooming in the oil patch. Maybe you’re thinking about Saskatchewan?

8744 2018-01-11 06:06:42 It's amazing how much of modern science involves so much snake oil and bullshit with mathematical woo. It's probably a reflection of the times.
8745 2018-01-11 06:06:40 If you look up oils in bulk, you can get a pound of any oil for like 5$ and for $17 you can get like a 7 pound tub of the shit lol

8801 2018-01-11 05:57:47 In 1969 there was no such thing as a blowout preventer to pinch off the well in case of a rupture.  The oil is under MUCH less pressure than that in, for example. Deepwater Horizon.  This would be very low risk production.

8806 2018-01-11 05:57:29 You mean expensive? And Norway is ridiculously pricey, but the sudden oil riches are to blame. Its funny because Sweden and Denmark used to bully Norway so much, but now Swedes are the ones peeling bananas in Norway for $20/hr.

8813 2018-01-11 05:56:12 I usually boil mine (it’s easy + fast) for 30 min. Then I set aside and let them cool just a bit. Pour a mixture of olive oil, garlic, salt + pepper on the artichoke. Summer time, I usually boil for 15 min then move to the grill and pour the same mixture on top.
8814 2018-01-11 05:55:39 And it’s like oil in your mouth. I have never hated a drink this much
8815 2018-01-11 05:55:37 Shhhh... If oil companies know that, they'll have everyone there killed.
8816 2018-01-11 05:55:30 If you look at the amount of oil that was dumped weekly in the Pacific due to ship and tanker sinkings in WW2 we are talking about a small amount of oil.  Production operations are MUCH better than they were 50 years ago. This is shallow oil in shallow water, very low risk.

8848 2018-01-11 05:52:06 Contrary to popular belief people with oily skin should use oils on their face, adding oil to your face tells it to stop producing its own in excess. The thing is knowing which oils to use
8849 2018-01-11 05:52:05 And the environment is adapted to the oil that is seeping naturally. Leaked oil overwhelms a system. Check out the NOAA site on oil seeping and leaking. They track the oil that is seeping.

8875 2018-01-11 05:48:37 @SecretaryZinke , seems clear.  Florida is where Trump vacations, nearly every week, where he funnels millions of our tax dollars.  So of course he doesn't want offshore drilling and oil spills spoiling his favorite resort.  More than a little tainted don't you think?

I'm confused...what's his real position? Does anyone know? Does he even have a position, or did he just "say stuff," simply to get elected?

8906 2018-01-11 05:45:04 This is important. If Puerto Rico is an example of the Trump admin's response to a disaster, then expect a impotent response if there is an oil spill off the coast of California or any states now in the crosshairs of the fat cats.

8949 2018-01-11 05:38:19 What happens when crude drops to $20 dollar per barrel. Are we using luck and guess work to run the economy. Has it occurred to someone in power that by 2025 which is just around the corner no country will buy oil crude again cos the world will be using  clean energy then.

8957 2018-01-11 05:37:05 May as well put up a few more oil platforms - at least they benefit us more than the slum-by-the-sea cities in California
8958 2018-01-11 05:36:48 We must respect nature in the long run it is for our own good. Stop with the oil look for renewable sources. Ones that are pollution free and better for all of us.

8973 2018-01-11 05:35:13 Oil prices continue to climb, presently $63 per barrel. Where are the critics of the oil edge, oil could cost Jamaica up to $1.5B annually, is this sustainable?  @AndrewHolnessJM @AudleyShaw @HillAubyn

8975 2018-01-11 05:34:38 But he’s taking medical care away from many Americans by making it unaffordable. He’s taking away clean air and water by allowing less regs on big polluters and supporting dirty coal and oil, and allowing mass drilling offshore. He takes more away from people than he helps.

8987 2018-01-11 05:32:50 I started using the moisturizer by Kheils about a month ago and i love it!!! I also mixed some tea tree oil into it but that’s bc i have adult acne :/ but either way it’s good!! Kind of pricey but worth it!
8988 2018-01-11 05:32:03 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Lee
8989 2018-01-11 05:31:48 Or take essential oils like Lemon and Peppermint combined with oil and rub it on the spine. That helps too and is way less toxic than your suggestion.
8990 2018-01-11 05:31:38 anybody know why cloves oil straight up smells like Arby’s sauce #sketch
8991 2018-01-11 05:31:37 I wonder if MY senator could sue the E-co Dept/Oil Co. for illegal trespass on a state wildlife sanctuary. In concordance with the PEOPLE. Like Mayor De Blasio
8992 2018-01-11 05:31:28 Profit is what is left over after people are paid to retrieve the oil and gas from the ground, refine it, and deliver it to homes and high rises to keep people warm in cold NY winters. NYC taxes it all, and now they want to bite the hand that warms and feeds them.
#insanity
8993 2018-01-11 05:31:27 what it do, fam?

who else on the midnight oil shift, with me?
8994 2018-01-11 05:31:20 Like a macho manly man, blue collar hard worker type. Last time I heard it, my friend used it to talk about someone who was working on oil rigs and thoughts really highly of themselves.
8995 2018-01-11 05:31:08 No oil rigs off the coast of Mar-a-lago.  Wow self-serving SOB's.  Trump Turd is at it again!
8996 2018-01-11 05:31:02 It can't get any more misguided that NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio suing 5 oil companies for their part in climate change. Clearly the Mayor doesn't realize that 80% of emissions are transportation related - planes, trains, and automobiles.
8997 2018-01-11 05:30:49 "I'M GETTING THE OIL-"
8998 2018-01-11 05:30:40 Olive oil with a kick!
8999 2018-01-11 05:30:32 I live for those Frank Thomas commercials. Mostly because I know not long from now Eric Hosmer will be on TV selling our generation testosterone-boosting snake oil.
9000 2018-01-11 05:30:29 Opening up coastal states for off shore drilling:
Catastrophic 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill demonstrated, 40 mi off LA coast, oil found on 1,313 mi of coastline in LA, Al, MS, Fl & TX; cleanup crews collected 106,000 tons of oily material from Gulf Coast.
9001 2018-01-11 05:30:21 Friday = new tires and oil change
9002 2018-01-11 05:30:16 CBD oil is said to be beneficial for all sorts of things.  What have you used CBD  for?
9003 2018-01-11 05:30:15 it really annoys me that my oil diffuser says it shuts off after an hour but it actually doesn’t turn off at all unless there’s no water in it 
9004 2018-01-11 05:30:11 Or oil
9005 2018-01-11 05:29:55 Exxon and the Oil industry have known the truth about climate change for nearly all my adult life.  This propaganda shouldnt be on twitter.
9006 2018-01-11 05:29:43 The short on "why oil companies:" They and their stakeholders donate to Republicans.
9007 2018-01-11 05:29:19 That's the way to fight back against oil rigs off the coast of Washington!
9008 2018-01-11 05:28:59 Hempseed oil

9010 2018-01-11 05:28:55 Missed the biggest subsidy of all. Do drivers pay for foreign wars to protect oil supplies? Like the trillion dollar adventure in Iraq? No, they don’t.
9011 2018-01-11 05:28:52 Did you check the oil and water before using it?
9012 2018-01-11 05:28:48 Get you a mans who malashs your hair with coconut oil
9013 2018-01-11 05:28:46 I think you have an oil leak. (Vegeta)
9014 2018-01-11 05:28:42 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
9015 2018-01-11 05:28:38 Wait... beds can be used, for fucking???

Why was I not told this? I almost always used the floor cuz there was more room!

Besides, if you use a bed... aren’t you worried the plastic sheeting won’t protect the mattress from the mazolla oil?!?!
9016 2018-01-11 05:28:35 何のoilかが気になる
9017 2018-01-11 05:28:19 Castor oil
9018 2018-01-11 05:28:13 And what is that culpability? Are we going to sue every contractor who was hired to build homes in the Louisiana floodplain? And what about the massive national carbon footprint reduction caused by the shale revolution? Why oil companies and not utilities?
9019 2018-01-11 05:28:07 Hopefully they put in the Original ingredients.
Nestle =Shit! Cheap Arse Palm oil..high fructose sugar...and other ingredients. Nestle will get massively sued in the future.
9020 2018-01-11 05:28:04 Right.  That was the oil in oil lamps.  No more whaling for oil now
9021 2018-01-11 05:27:50 Yeah good luck with that. Perhaps the fossil fuel giants will refuse to supply oil products to NYC in retaliation. Now that would be interesting in the middle of winter, or summer for that matter.
9022 2018-01-11 05:27:42 It didn't happen to me before, this is how I use it:
Take a big cherry size for all over my face and massage it until it melt into fairly liquidly and oil texture (until I see the makeup has melted, on full coverage days I repeat twice). I used the warm wet towel (tbc)
9023 2018-01-11 05:27:31 Is it not remarkable? Simple oil of cloves, and how amazing the results
9024 2018-01-11 05:27:25 Thank you! I don't want to see our state ruined by this offshore oil drilling in North Carolina. This is a travesty and totally unnecessary. #TheResistance

9027 2018-01-11 05:26:53 You’re not happy here, my son. Move away and free yourself. Go live among the oil rigs.
9028 2018-01-11 05:26:36 Not sure what 2 do about Iran, boo. Oil is everything there & oil is done. We'll never go above $4/gal in gas in the US ever again (said that 2 yrs ago).  Maybe Iran can figure a way 2 capture & export directed energy since DE solar farms here in the US seem 2 cause draughts. Hmm
9029 2018-01-11 05:26:22 One cannot expect electric vehicle growth without the needed electrical infrastructure. As both industries flourish our dependence on internal combustion engines will wane along with our use of crude oil. So, in fact it's quite relevant.

9032 2018-01-11 05:25:29 Is the lawsuit going to force a change in practices of major oil corporations, or will they just be handing over money, like the fines they get on an annual basis? Is this real-politick, or is it to create change?

9035 2018-01-11 05:25:11 Also according to the graph you posted, Texas uses almost as much oil despite the fact they have 13 million fewer people. That means per capita they use more. Evidence of California’s efforts to use less fuel.

9042 2018-01-11 05:23:14 On this day in history:
 1863- London Underground's Metropolitan Railway opens
 1870- William and John D. Rockefeller found the Standard Oil Company of Ohio
 1917- Death of William "Buffalo Bill" Cody
 1946- The League of Nations dissolves and becomes the United Nations
9043 2018-01-11 05:23:01 I specifically stated environmental burden in the pervious tweet.  Never economic burden.  That's what this thread is about, correct? Oil rigs are not permanent structures. They can me moved and dismantled. But the REALITY is we won't all be driving electric cars by 2025.
9044 2018-01-11 05:22:59 何時からなら大丈夫？

9046 2018-01-11 05:22:43 Oils help clear up, I love me some argan oil for my face and coconut oil for my body. I also make a scrub with brown sugar and coconut oil.
9047 2018-01-11 05:22:30 Wow! No way to go more public? They've been pulling this crap forever. Governments don't want us trading goods or information privately, that's why mail is a government monopoly. See Lysander Spooner's American Mail Company or see how Standard Oil stole patents and used them.

9053 2018-01-11 05:20:56 What is oil pulling & how do u do it 
9054 2018-01-11 05:20:33 For sure. It sticks arnd on clothes until washing. I have been looking at outdoor stoves to use when spice oil and heat together.  Great cooking as always, inspires.
9055 2018-01-11 05:20:27 Besides the fact that my husband and I own a business that depends on Oregon Coast Tourism, if anyone enjoys seafood from the Pacific Northwest or Alaska you might want to rethink if it’s a good idea to risk eliminating the seafood industry here so big oil can make more money.
9056 2018-01-11 05:20:25 Thick layers of oil covering Laguna, Seal, Huntington beaches doesn't sound great, but whatever you're into.
9057 2018-01-11 05:20:21 Oregon Washington and California all have ecological need for protection. As well whales through the PNW would be an issue with your plan. That is their world. We have economic dependence on the waters and coast. Imagine surfing by the California coast oil well.
9058 2018-01-11 05:20:15 I heard that if you use hemp oil as a moisturizer it helps reduce acne and take away scars so i been using it for a week anD IT ACTUALLY WORKS im shaking

9060 2018-01-11 05:20:05 @billburr truffle oil POV is spot on. It overpowers everything and it’s what i imagine cologne tastes like
9061 2018-01-11 05:20:01 Please can you mention specifically what "decision" you are talking about. Price of oil increased in international market, more money came, we exit recession, and suffer worse fuel scarcity, with its corresponding high inflation. Hope you are getting your mathematics correct so.
9062 2018-01-11 05:19:54 @BPCLLPG Govt of India abolish the transaction charges on debit card purchase upto Rs 2000 but BPCL is charging Rs 6.58 for online payment through Debit Card. Connection no 57378286. Govt of India demotivating cashless transaction. Oil PSUs are disobeying the PM vision.

9064 2018-01-11 05:19:31 Right now, it's only been detected in the fire hydrants, so there's no risk to residents provided they follow the no use order. But given that hydrocarbons are essentially trace amounts of oil, one can assume it's not safe to ingest.
9065 2018-01-11 05:19:29 So the definition at the end allows for oil to be poured in the a container of water and then they make each other wet?
9066 2018-01-11 05:19:29 How many homeless people trying to live in USA? Who care about them? I think no one. Everyone says something about Turkey right? Look we have 4 Million Refugee and we spent 12 Billion dollar... We don't have oil well or natural gas... When will you wake up guys? #Homeless

9070 2018-01-11 05:19:08 First, those two states make a shit ton of money off that oil. Calling it a “burden” is debatable. Second, let’s stop being archaic. Let’s use the technology we have to begin moving away from fossil fuels bc it has to start somewhere&it doesn’t start by making it easier to drill
9071 2018-01-11 05:18:57 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.

9076 2018-01-11 05:17:49 Study your history this is a direct result of USA interference in Iran in the 50s for oil. There wouldn't be a need to protest as they had a free society before we stepped in for greed and changed leaders

9097 2018-01-11 05:14:17 Most of that is not even remotely true. Are you conflating solar with oil? Batteries? It's incredibly difficult to have a conversation w/ you since you are hellbent on being  perceived as "right" instead of engaging in intellectual discourse. It makes me think very little of you.

9128 2018-01-11 05:09:39 Exactly. Let’s not take more giant risks to more places. The oil rigs there have proven dangerous. Building more is just anti logic.why make it easier to build destructive things?

9155 2018-01-11 05:04:19 Oregon's future is reflected by our governor Kate Brown, with all new homes pre wired for solar energy, and energy alternatives priced lower than oil, off shore oil only feeds corporate greed that can't compete without ignoring the cost of health care.

9169 2018-01-11 05:02:45 Most people don't like going to beaches and looking at oil rigs. Just look on sites like Trip Advisor. People do complain about it. They will likely opt for a beach with no oil rig view and go somewhere else. You may think it's "stupid", but that doesn't make it any less true.
9170 2018-01-11 05:02:32 Why don’t you be the shining example and stop using automobiles and airplanes. You might as well stop eating and wearing clothes because “big oil” plays their part in getting those things to you.... friggin dumb ass

9209 2018-01-11 04:57:41 That cut of safety & of taxes to fund clean up and loss could lead to skyrocketing fuel prices. @POTUS screwed the pooch here. Now, millions of gallons of oil have been burning for 4 days.

Isn't that like paying someone to murder a person, then taking the money back and charging them with murder?

9241 2018-01-11 04:52:39 We have to keep some macro factors in mind which are turning against the markets. 10 yr@7.44% and crude oil hitting new highs. While the markets may continue to go up it is better to hedge your long term portfolio at least to the extent of 65%.

9273 2018-01-11 04:48:13 Oh, and BTW: #NYC is #divesting its fossil fuel holdings in its pension fund. And suing oil companies for causing climate change. #justanotherbigday @NEWGPGH @Allegheny_Co @_demarcop6 @PGHLocalNews
9274 2018-01-11 04:47:39 If he handles this lawsuit as capably as he handled the groundhog he murdered, Big Oil has nothing to worry about.

9289 2018-01-11 04:45:35 Rosehip oil changed my life... I'd like to make this declaration to the masses
9290 2018-01-11 04:45:31 Before fossil fuels, people ran cities off whale oil and firewood. @Greenpeace wants to return to those days.
9291 2018-01-11 04:45:27 I put some argon oil in my beard and it feels fuckin amazing.
9292 2018-01-11 04:45:27 Tea tree oil works, and using stainless steel helps
9293 2018-01-11 04:45:15 So did oil leak out of the bullet hole in the ceiling just like the intro on the show?
9294 2018-01-11 04:45:11 You say your legs hurt you need a massage turn it over I got some oil I could rub on your thighs bust it open I love the way that you hide, turn over hide from the side Look me right up in my eyes
9295 2018-01-11 04:45:08 I spilled coconut oil all over my laptop, I guess it will have beautiful smooth skin now
9296 2018-01-11 04:44:51 Divesting is stupid. Give up your plastic and your vehicles and your electronics and then I’ll be impressed that you’re actually divesting yourself from oil.

9298 2018-01-11 04:44:34 Especially since the states of OR, WA & nothern CA all reside in one of the most dangerous subduction zones in the world.  No amount of man made offshore oil drilling is safe in subduction zones, including our Cascadia Subduction Zone, which is overdue for the ‘Big One’.

9308 2018-01-11 04:43:34 Oil is a world market.  Plenty to go around
9309 2018-01-11 04:43:32 Because Michael Moore promised to drill for oil right next to his precious Mar-a-Lago.

9328 2018-01-11 04:41:39 Different submersibles that oil companies use (which is basically everything you can think of) have a feature like that, but it's more like radio or even sat signals. I think getting lost doesn't usually happen.

9336 2018-01-11 04:41:18 To turn the water off. This caused a pipe to freeze and had to call a plumber. Oil company did not show until Tuesday at 11 and that was after another pipe burst. Need plumber again. Very angry with oil company.
9337 2018-01-11 04:41:01 Yep. And the fryer oil that is used in most fast food places is the worst. Reused excessively, too.
9338 2018-01-11 04:40:58 Boycott BP Russia has controlling shares in that company and they make a lot of money and it’s their oil we need a national campaign to boycott BP

9340 2018-01-11 04:40:31 Simple oil of cloves...

9347 2018-01-11 04:39:59 I lived with pseudomonas for one year-after quad bypass. I cured it by eating fresh crushed garlic cloves 12 day! Topical and internal applications of “WILD” Oregano oil. Surgeons exposed my sternum (removed everything) and there was no infection in the tissue. Google them!

9349 2018-01-11 04:39:38 Great. But if you helicopters to oil rigs your money is still rooted there. Like Al Michaels isn’t employed by the nfl but he still has a pretty solid interest financially.
9350 2018-01-11 04:39:35 It’s like a tornado bag but instead of 3 days of water - margaritas, swimsuit, flip flops, & oil

9353 2018-01-11 04:39:18 This oil is so fucking heavy wow
9354 2018-01-11 04:39:15 We have had nothing but problems since the beginning of the year. This past weekend we had our oil company here on Saturday the 6th in the late evening. At 2:00 am the furnace went out again and we called them back. We then had water leaking out of our furnace and we were advised

9357 2018-01-11 04:39:02 Mechanically separated from flower, solvent free, hardest part is educating the parents on how to do it and how and why to do multi month batches that can be tested at minimal cost compared to LP produced oil.
9358 2018-01-11 04:38:57 Ooooohohh the key to keeping your hair soft is to add in a little oil after u have washed ur hair (and dried it) then even days later it’ll be soft~

9362 2018-01-11 04:38:31 Are we still importing expensive oil? Prices high,

9365 2018-01-11 04:38:18 Easy, Twitter folk. Let’s work all this out...with baby oil...on the plastic sheets.
9366 2018-01-11 04:38:12 What do you do with tea tree oil?
9367 2018-01-11 04:38:04 @realDonaldTrump . Open up more oil drilling. Build refineries. Drill off the Debt. Use our oil to get us out of the Red.
9368 2018-01-11 04:37:45 Is troubling after so many years when hardly any ever left voluntarily. Is a good question. Why?
9369 2018-01-11 04:37:44 あ普通にDLできたわ
9370 2018-01-11 04:37:38 Sure, Trump doesn’t want an oil spell near Mar-a-Lago. Destroy our country and environment for big company profits.
9371 2018-01-11 04:37:29 this is such a blatant abuse of power right in front of ALL AMERICANS to SEE! does TRUMP not know that he is the SWAMP KING!!! dishonest mafia-like power, only florida +  Mara Lago have no oil rigs!!! 
9372 2018-01-11 04:37:21 Easiest way to save them money : 20%CBD <1% THC strains @ $9/g = 200mg of CBD. Parents press it into rosin, dilute with carrier oil, send to lab for exact dosage test. With testing and multi month supply of oil $40 vs $90/800mg. 100% ACMPR compliant. 1/2
9373 2018-01-11 04:37:19 I bought a big ass bottle of jojoba oil & I highly recommend buying some and soaking yourself head to toe in it.
9374 2018-01-11 04:37:16 Has anyone ever sued an oil company over a spill?
9375 2018-01-11 04:37:15 Yeah I’m aware LA is Louisiana. However this policy would be all coasts except Florida. That’s why we’re concerned. You said oil rigs can’t be seen. Well they can lots of places.

9378 2018-01-11 04:36:21 The rapid rise of oil prices isn't just OPEC. It's a sign of inflation--an early sign, but still a sign.

9382 2018-01-11 04:36:06 They are tying the hands of the EPA.  So they are strong on ruining the environment. If he really cared he would stay in the Paris climate agreement and would not be opening up offshore oil drilling.
9383 2018-01-11 04:35:53 Leave a boat in the water for 30 years with fuel & oil in its tanks, apparently abandoned..Literally rusting, and falling apart until it starts sinking..What a way to treat our water ways..Who gets to pay for this?? Taxpayers??

9385 2018-01-11 04:35:34 My parents got me an essential oil for my birthday, and let me tell you...this thing is the best thing since sliced bread
9386 2018-01-11 04:35:30 I tried looking it up last night and got mixed reviews for dogs/cats! I diffuse every night at bedtime on a 4 hour timer, and it’s never harmed the cat or my dog. I think you’d have to use pretty high doses, or they’d need actual contact/ingestion of the oil to cause much harm.

9393 2018-01-11 04:34:24 Preeeeeaaaaaccchhhh!!! Sis it's cool tho I'm still using my coconut oil & sleeping good. So, who mad? 
9394 2018-01-11 04:34:20 There’s oil right under the LA Farmers Market!!! Can we go get it???
9395 2018-01-11 04:34:16 Good luck with that. It’d be more prudent to exhaust appeals and preludes than to rattle sabres with big oil. Just ask the 100k pissed expats who leave every year.
9396 2018-01-11 04:34:04 idk man i can have peanut oil it’s worth a shot
9397 2018-01-11 04:33:52 The oil is in the seed
9398 2018-01-11 04:33:47 I guess if you ignore the literally billions of dollars of capital that has fled for more competitive jurisdictions. That money will find oil & gas development outside of Alberta and likely more CO2 than if produces here. But it’s all good because we get free lightbulbs!
9399 2018-01-11 04:33:47 I'll try coconut oil 
9400 2018-01-11 04:33:43 Trump, you are mad if you think Americans are going to put up with your oil plan. Good fucking luck.
9401 2018-01-11 04:33:29 My dick has been soaking in olive oil since I was 5 years old
9402 2018-01-11 04:33:17 The oil companies just pull it out of the ground. NYC city government uses it and turns it into pollution.
9403 2018-01-11 04:33:13 Thank you Scott, I saw later it was oil, I just took up painting and am using Acrylics, right now my work is looking like something I'd do in grade 4 or 5, but i will stay with it. I've seen 2 of yours now and am impressed.

9429 2018-01-11 04:30:36 maybe not starting two wars in the Middle East would moderate oil prices? just spitballing here.
9430 2018-01-11 04:30:33 With the amount of school closures and imminent warnings on Twitter tonight, if Billy Bob Thornton isn’t on the news tomorrow morning with a bunch of oil drillers behind him, telling us we are sending them to stop an incoming asteroid, I’m going to be pretty damn disappointed
9431 2018-01-11 04:30:24 yeah same as erin it wasn't bad at all it hurt less than my daith and i cleaned my a lot when i first got it and it's fine now and the guy who pierced mine said to put tea tree oil on it if it gets a pump

9437 2018-01-11 04:29:17 Thank you. Was just curious because I know it ran bk in December but also took note of oil recently rising. Maybe another run coming! $$$
9438 2018-01-11 04:29:16 Governor:  What if we take the gas that goes to Oregon and allocate it to states that have oil drilling to lower their gas prices.  Seems fair.  If Oregon is not part of our energy solution, why should you get energy from other states.  Oh and that applies to electricity too. JM

it was hell on my already high anxiety levels

Bright side though they have a new Bath Oil called Polyamory and you know ya girl got it.
9447 2018-01-11 04:28:20 Flash point of olive oil is lower than peanut/canola oils-I use a lot of olive oil in lower heat sauté and vegetable oil for higher heat. Also, safest to discard the oil immediately after 1 use, don't reuse as some do. See Udo Erasmus' book 'Fats and Oils' for more info.
9448 2018-01-11 04:27:51 Yes I do..my friend sells young living and I buy them from her.

9450 2018-01-11 04:27:32 Cruz is doing what the oil companies want.   Beto it for Texans.  Taking no money from the out of state Koch bros or rich Mercer’s who owe back taxes.  Keep on rolling.  Impressive

9453 2018-01-11 04:27:20 BOOM, cut them off., quit buying from Middle East.  We have all the oil we need here between Texas and Louisiana.  We just need to get the RINOS to cut us loose.

9462 2018-01-11 04:25:57 The citrus oil in oranges is inflammable and the same is not true in oranges. Also, the flesh of both fruits are different colours, texture, and structure. Despite the fact they are both fruit native to South Asia, there is little resemblance. (All fruit has seeds Roxy)

9476 2018-01-11 04:24:08 I know how to change the oil , I know how to mix the gas. But I can't crash 
9477 2018-01-11 04:23:50 Any oil &gas production can concentrate natural radioactive material (NORM). There are strict state & federal regulations concerning handling & disposal. The case you refer to was a criminal violation, not legal oil development.
9478 2018-01-11 04:23:33 Maybe Big Oil will tell NYC, "No fossil fuels for you!"
9479 2018-01-11 04:23:28 Oh nice! I’ve got the Ellia Fight It oil (and I loooooove it!) and get lavender oil at Whole Foods since it’s...actually reasonably priced for its size in my area!

9481 2018-01-11 04:22:59 So if there is a wall to Mexico, what about Canada? What about the Atlantic coast, Pacific coast & Gulf of Mexico? Illegals might be able to get in from transports on all those oil platforms that are on the way. How can you protect against domestic terrorists?

9492 2018-01-11 04:21:05 Autominated machines are replacing people already.  This will just speed it up.  NDP are against oil. They will be out soon.
9493 2018-01-11 04:21:01 yeah it isn't like the oils sands where there is all this oil in the ground leaking into the water and rivers and evaporating into the air.  thankfully there are people cleaning it up and trying to make Alberta cleaner.
9494 2018-01-11 04:20:58 I read that the tax bill deleted a five cents per barrel tax on domestic oil that went towards cleanup costs.

9523 2018-01-11 04:15:53 No they are not "inevitable" but in any case, do you have any idea how much oil seeps naturally into the ocean off California?  10,000 gallons PER DAY off Coal Oil Point near Santa Barbara.
9524 2018-01-11 04:15:46 Average American children are their future service providers.

9530 2018-01-11 04:14:57 ... significantly increases the likelihood of oil spills in the ocean, correct? So where's the logic in this? We'll pollute the oceans for the sake of saving money and making more money?
9531 2018-01-11 04:14:34 Oil prices rising is sign of OPEC policies . . . They still want to kill US fracking and keep some markets, they keep production up

9536 2018-01-11 04:13:43 Let’s see if I got this: Obama gave the Iranians some money and let them build nukes. He’s the hero of the gas pumps. Trump pulls the plug and holds them accountable. Iranians riot. Speculators go nuts. Buy oil. Plus an electric car.
9537 2018-01-11 04:13:42 Which oil industries are fools enough to put money on Trump’s offshore drilling knowing this could be forbidden again in 2018 or 2020 with Democrats winning the elections

There's a tanker carrying 100M gallons of oil in the China sea on verge of explosion, deepwater horizon disaster, and they just cut the tax money that paid for cleanup efforts. And lifting safeguards on offshore oil drilling...

9545 2018-01-11 04:12:37 You seem to have cleverly avoided talking about the huge dues to OMCs which were left pending by UPA. Are you aware of the Oil Bonds which were not even part of the Union Budget.
9546 2018-01-11 04:12:24 I think we’re going to see many species pushed to the brink of extinction over the next decade or two.  There will come a day when humans are fighting over clean water instead of money & oil, probably in our lifetime.

9552 2018-01-11 04:11:45 When roasting chillies, or sauteeing them in oil, ensure that you snip the end beforehand. Chillies without any escape for the expanding air inside it, will explode forcefully. You don't want to be there.

9556 2018-01-11 04:11:13 I made homemade meatballs and homemade pasta sauce today.
Boiled some gnocchi and then pan fried them in truffle oil to make them solid on the outside, but pillowy inside.  
Mixed the two and it instantly validated the 5hrs I’d spent in the kitchen today.
9557 2018-01-11 04:11:08 Done! #MAGA
9558 2018-01-11 04:11:07 I get that on an economic level it "looks good" but can you justify this... (I have several things but I'll start with this) in this tax bill not only were safeguards lifted on offshore oil drilling, but the 9 cent tax/ barrel that generated $500M/year, and all that money went...
9559 2018-01-11 04:10:59 Thanks! I think a lot of those people commenting are likely oil and gas workers that are proud of producing energy resources that help keep folks warm and the lights on in big cities like NYC!
9560 2018-01-11 04:10:48 I legit just put coconut oil on my whole body
9561 2018-01-11 04:10:45 There goes the fishing industry, swimming, diving , seafood restaurant it won't be long until they also have an oil spill..
9562 2018-01-11 04:10:40 #@ Rachel Maddow  Rachel know what I was just thinking remember Putin and Tillerson was going to have that big oil drilling deal billions and billions of dollars well now all of a sudden Trump says you can drill anywhere guess they're going to get it you can't make this stuff up

9566 2018-01-11 04:10:24 Close to home (western WV) for me too. Even more frustrating because it seems impossible to get those from outside Appalachia to understand. I’m from a line of farmers, but many distant cousins worked in oil or natural gas

Perhaps this had something to do with the economics of the project based on global oil prices, and not the AB provincial budget.

9580 2018-01-11 04:08:50 If Florida gets the only protection from the oil drilling things will get ugly on Florida’s coast I would imagine. Fight for all coast not just your own.
9581 2018-01-11 04:08:48 This is true! So renewable wind energy off the coast should be banned, but oil drilling is OK.

9589 2018-01-11 04:07:47 Just because oil is still rising doesn’t mean it’s going to keep rising or even rise as fast ever again. We would be dumping millions of dollars into a industry that’s either going to run out or lose market value. That money has to be spent on diversification.

9611 2018-01-11 04:04:33 “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink in. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
9612 2018-01-11 04:03:44 What's your plan for when petrol dries up, even beyond the accelerating oil wars?  Honestly asking.  Do you think oil will last forever?  When would you propose we begin seriously investing in renewable energy?
9613 2018-01-11 04:03:39 Short of harsher sanctions than the former ones, the impact of any sanctions on the Iranian oil exports is limited anyway.  In my outlook, Iran is a non-event on both fronts: the nuclear deal and demonstrations.  lifting the sanctions made oil exports "legal"!

9627 2018-01-11 04:02:44 They haven't forgotten, that's why they changes the tax so their friends in the oil and gas industry won't have to pay for cleanup.
9628 2018-01-11 04:02:28 Secretary Zinke, Florida's coast is not unique; the entire U.S. coast is unique and deserves protection. Please remove all our coastline from the offshore drilling plan. You work for all U.S. citizens, not just the oil companies.
9629 2018-01-11 04:02:28 Well leases are not part of oil sands projects.  Let’s not mix the topics up, the governments at federal and provincial levels have buggered the abandon well program.  Not ensuring adequate remediation dollars were paid upfront.

9631 2018-01-11 04:02:02 Gee. Should we wonder why? Could it be that Trump doesn't want any oil spill ruining his Maralago business? Of course it is!
9632 2018-01-11 04:01:59 In my opinion it’s going up not in a couple day but in a few days that could be even couple of weeks. It vent from 0.02 to 0.069 in a few days in December.
Oil is going up recently and this stock has a low float. Still just my opinion. Don’t take a position bc of me GL
9633 2018-01-11 04:01:42 Maybe he could stop up the oil with his hair?

he was re-elected.  unbelievable.
9635 2018-01-11 04:01:30 The water is relatively shallow there and the oil itself is also very shallow.  Pretty low risk drilling by modern standards.
9636 2018-01-11 04:01:14 We DO NOT want trumps oil drilling nonsense ANYWHERE near Oregon! Vote BLUE 2018.....

9647 2018-01-11 04:00:16 Maybe that IS the problem. They think being arbitrary and capricious is standard for government (rather than legal standard for agency abuse). (Also, "Chevron deference" does not refer to sucking up to Big Oil)
9648 2018-01-11 04:00:14 And take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and sanctify it and all its furnishings, and it... Exodus 40:9

9656 2018-01-11 03:59:49 That’s true and a good spot. Definitely check the exhaust pipe for signs of heavy oil use. I’d drive both and see which one feels right to you; ultimately it’s what you are happy driving. They are both priced right.

Lies like oil is more important than nature preserves.
Lies like money "trumps" ethics.

9694 2018-01-11 03:54:47 U can try taking shots of my oregano oil if u would like??? Didn't work for me but I paid $25 for it so I'm willing to share
9695 2018-01-11 03:54:37 Kate, Don't say it doesn't reflect all Oregonians as if oil drilling would bring clean oil with good $ to fund police and education I say why not. I have been a Oregonian for over 70 years.
9696 2018-01-11 03:54:36 it’s not an oil painting but in this economy? It’s not realistic
9697 2018-01-11 03:54:31 - I am soooo in need of a good ol bubble bath , wine , music to be rubbed down in oil and a full body massage . . I deserve it damnit ! 
9698 2018-01-11 03:54:02 Yana the oil only works on the person u want 
so like u wear it and it only attracts the person u want it to attracts
9699 2018-01-11 03:54:02 Lavender essential oil is my new found love
9700 2018-01-11 03:53:48 Can they pull back on oil as well?
9701 2018-01-11 03:53:36 that's an interesting thought - that sanctions are priced into oil right now. possible. 
9702 2018-01-11 03:53:30 Sometimes I can be critical without proposing an alternative solution. In regard to my previous tweet: Strong ind & corp incentives for significant reduction of oil consumption is a far better thing to put effort into. Problem is it doesn't make anyone filthy rich. #MAGAnomics
9703 2018-01-11 03:53:21 WHY DID YOU GET THE WEED OIL
9704 2018-01-11 03:53:13 Yeah agreed ! I think they be cooking with bad oil Bc one time I had it super fresh and it didn’t do that

9709 2018-01-11 03:52:36 You would think a country that has a healthy tradition of car building and dependent on foreign oil would be at the forefront of electric cars. Go figure.
9710 2018-01-11 03:52:21 I just want my feet rubbed with some almond oil ...
9711 2018-01-11 03:52:09 Oil is his element..
Oily Orange Bastard
9712 2018-01-11 03:52:04 Doesn’t apply to Russians. Just like oil drilling doesn’t apply to Florida where he owns properties.
9713 2018-01-11 03:51:59 Girl my original tweet was a mess lol. I meant the oil from ranch dressing and it didn’t come out that way
9714 2018-01-11 03:51:50 It's green for money ... the money the nuclear, oil and coal industry is making from selling electricity to light New York City! Oh, and to fuel your jet! Oh, and it represents the fact that all the NYC millionaires can no longer write off the high NY state taxes #idiot
9715 2018-01-11 03:51:49 That's when I normally have been doing it but I want to see if leaving it in overnight will help the oil. Worth a try I guess.
9716 2018-01-11 03:51:39 I remember hearing the largest oil reserve ever found is in the Dakotas and Montana. Why not drill there?
9717 2018-01-11 03:51:38 Filed a National Interest Waiver (NIW) #immigration case for a Mechanical Engineer working in the Oil & Gas Industry in Pennsylvania.

9721 2018-01-11 03:50:44 it has an oil added to it to prevent it from melting in the constant heat. every single U.K. backpacker in Australia gets care packages sent with English Cadbury because they can’t stand the taste of Australian chocolate

9726 2018-01-11 03:50:14 Sadly that's what happened. Theres actually a shortage of oil. Only a Socialist Government can cause an oil shortage in an oil rich country.

9728 2018-01-11 03:49:57 This good policy for Florida also needs to be extended to other coastal states that are strongly opposing coastal oil drilling. 
No drilling on the West Coast
9729 2018-01-11 03:49:55 Pro tip: For every expense, see if there's a gift card on Amazon. Flights? Southwest cards! Gas? Irving oil! Rooms? Hotels dot com! Groceries? Whole Foods! The possibilities are endless.
9730 2018-01-11 03:49:45 didn’t he also lift restrictions so oil companies are not financially responsible for cleanup

9741 2018-01-11 03:48:02 Let me mansplain this one to you, Donny Boy. If Florida gets an exemption from coastal drilling, then every state with a beach gets one cause oil rigs and tar patches on the beach drive ALL tourism away!
9742 2018-01-11 03:48:00 Why not preheat oil? Just safety reason.  Feel things soak up the oil more when it's not hot first?
9743 2018-01-11 03:47:49 Did you save enough room for oil drilling rights?

9783 2018-01-11 03:42:57 Our landfills and oceans would not be as polluted with plastic if we had invested in hemp instead of oil. Hemp plastic is 100% biodegradable. Plastic made from oil is not. The oil industry profited from eliminating their environmentally friendly competition via a drug war?

9808 2018-01-11 03:38:40 You can definitely get a lot of miles out of that engine with lots of care. Full synthetic oil, replace all your belts and hoses, and always give it lots of time to warm up. Seems like common sense, but really makes a difference with a Jeep.

9838 2018-01-11 03:35:26 Hey crybaby Gov Scott. Dont worry about drilling for oil.  Texas is proud and strong enough to handle it. It just goes to prove that you and your cronies are not Americans first...you're Floridians first. I'm calling for an added tax to all coast states that don't drill!

9842 2018-01-11 03:34:51 Yep, this was an evil plot devised 100+ years ago by the evil oil executives that has finally been uncovered by De Blasio. Brilliant.

9844 2018-01-11 03:34:42 I live in Texas. I feel any state that gets a waiver from drilling should pay a steep tax or fee. Why should we run the risk of oil spills and they don’t?  I don’t get this decision #realDonaldTrump
9845 2018-01-11 03:34:41 I could use some oil on the cool..
9846 2018-01-11 03:34:36 Just had this conversation with a friend today. He uses edible linseed oil but I’m on a budget so it’s mineral oil for me
9847 2018-01-11 03:34:11 Home owner pro tip: if you smell a peculiar burning smell, and nothing is visibly on fire, something is expiring in your furnace. Peculiar smell can run the range of plastic, oil, dust, and the hint of burning money. 
9848 2018-01-11 03:34:04 Coconut oil or baby oil. And don’t scratch! It’ll tear the skin it’ll make it easier to get stretch marks

9862 2018-01-11 03:32:49 @realDonaldTrump Not sure whether to refer to this person as King Donald or the reincarnation of the Teflon Don. Clearly the best snake oil salesman/liar in the history of the U.S. Master of deflection and proof that money does not make someone intelligent or worthy of respect.
9863 2018-01-11 03:32:48 I can't wait to relax tomorrow with some bubble bath and bath oil and candles and music.
9864 2018-01-11 03:32:44 I’ve heard Argan oil helps with split ends. And split ends can essentially “travel” up hair, so regular trims and/or split end treatments are a good idea.

9870 2018-01-11 03:31:35 Not sure what you’re worried about, Ted. We visit our daughter in Santa Cruz twice a year and think Monterey Bay, and the drive up through Big Sur along Highway 1 would look great with oil platforms. They could create a great new whale habitat! Please consider the big picture.

9879 2018-01-11 03:31:09 hell yeah
theyd probably have a hard time running with all that body oil tho
9880 2018-01-11 03:30:53 Except they will have to prove how the oil companies made the climate change. If they can get this into the 9th circuit they can use evidence from a 7th Science project. That should be plenty for the judicial activists from the 9th. #9thCircuit

9889 2018-01-11 03:29:58 That is complete BS - Why is Florida unique except for @realDonaldTrump has a resort on the Florida coast? - Every coastal state relies on the coast for tourism & NONE of them want Oil rigs fouling their beautiful beaches with oil, this is just political hypocrisy in the extreme.
9890 2018-01-11 03:29:50 I believe you can burn diesel instead of furnace oil to run a furnace, so I'm guessing that's where it went in this cold weather. Where they got a 200 gallon tank on a vehicle is another question.
9891 2018-01-11 03:29:50 Yeah. Use witch hazel two times. Before you wash your face because it gets rid of any dirt and oil that the cleanser might not be able to pick up then use it after u wash it to make your PH balanced. U jus put some which hazel on a cotton ball or pad and wipe it on your face.

9963 2018-01-11 03:19:46 Yeah, gas prices went up sharply during the Bush administration, in part because of the collapse of the Iraqi oil industry. In contrast, the American oil industry had banner years during the Obama administration.
9964 2018-01-11 03:19:45 Argh. This isn't that eats oil spills
9965 2018-01-11 03:19:45 Outstanding!  New York City is taking on the oil industry on two fronts, announcing a lawsuit Wednesday that blames the top five oil companies for contributing to global warming and saying the city will sell off billions in fossil fuel investments from the city’s pension funds.

9984 2018-01-11 03:17:13 I literally cannot sleep anymore if I don’t have lavender oil in my aromatherapy

9986 2018-01-11 03:16:10 So destroying our natural resources on land with fracking is ok, but offshore oil drilling is not . Seems to me offshore drilling is the lesser of the two evils.

9993 2018-01-11 03:15:36 i recommend putting castor oil or any other oil on your lashes as part of your nighttime routine ( ◡‿◡ ) and during the day if possible !!
9994 2018-01-11 03:15:32 Got some delicious Persian tea like they used to make at the restaurant where I worked. So fucking good.

9995 2018-01-11 03:15:27 *drowns existence in lavender oil*
9996 2018-01-11 03:15:10 it sounds counter-intuitive, but moisturizing helps with oil. sometimes, skin is oily cos it's actually dry, so it over-produces sebum to compensate. i recommend cosrx's hyaluronic acid moisturizer! it's VERY affordable and good for all skin types. very soothing.
9997 2018-01-11 03:15:00 They can drill all they want off of Calif coast. Their problem is Calif. Will not allow this oil to cross our dry land.

10000 2018-01-11 03:14:48 เช่น พยานในที่เกิดเหตุ เข้าแจ้งตำรวจหลังรู้ข่าว หรือไปแจ้งก่อนหน้าว่า เจอคนนี้ รูปร่างแบบนี้ น่าสงสัย ตำรวจก็จะเสก็ตภาพหา ได้ตัวผู้ต้องสงสัย แล้วถึงจะพาเขาไปตรวจลายนิ้วมือ ถ้าตรงก็ถือเป็นผู้กระทำผิด หากไม่มีใครแจ้งผู้ต้องสงสัย หาตัวไม่ได้ ก็หารอยนิ้วมือไม่ได้ค่ะ
