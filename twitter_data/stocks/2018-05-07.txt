3 2018-05-07 23:56:10 How do stocks work and why was I not taught about them in school
4 2018-05-07 23:55:33 Warren Buffett believes investors should buy stocks within their "circle of competence" and at attractive values to succeed in the stock market.

17 2018-05-07 23:36:37 Definitely beware of large fractions of your income going into stocks/options. Make sure that whatever the actually-liquid part of your offer is can cover your basic living expenses because there's a non-trivial probability that anything not liquid could be worth dirt

39 2018-05-07 23:35:27 The problem with Buffet and Gates is they don’t understand crypto currency.  The math decides the value of the token or coin based on usage.  As the years pass and the usage grows, crypto creates wealth for investors.  This threatens stocks and fiat.

61 2018-05-07 23:20:35 Hard not to like those picks. Think most those stocks should be going higher shortly.

65 2018-05-07 23:15:07 I think WTI has a cieling at 75.  That part of the monthly chart looks tricky.  Demand should drop next year and supply is plentiful.  If it gets to 75, in going 100% bond in the 401k and will be buying divvy stocks against index puts
66 2018-05-07 23:13:00 Buffet and Munger are much bigger names. What I hate instead is that the media notice that the ones you cited are biased sources since they also invested, yet the fail to notice that Buffet is on the other side of the bet (he famously love bank stocks)

83 2018-05-07 22:52:03 So, stocks are 'a process' wherein the conductors are enforced by the state. Ethereum also appears to be 'a process' to you. But With Bitcoin, to you, it's 'a community'. Do you believe bitcoin changes over time? do you believe there are conductors? What binary do you use?

He lied about raising the age because he’s scared of the NRA, something he accused others of being.
It’s time to recognize the conman for what he is.
90 2018-05-07 22:46:52 @realDonaldTrump turns his back on commitments to Parkland students, doesn’t: raise age limits on gun purchases, eliminate bump stocks, eliminate AR’s, eliminate gun show loopholes; plus, withdraws money from CHIPS, and is a serial bully.  “Be Best” should start at White House
91 2018-05-07 22:45:17 If it were that simple, you'd invest in stocks. Why Bitcoin, and not ethereum?

119 2018-05-07 22:20:30 I am glad that he changed his mind on the age and bump stocks issues. If you are 18 and are "licensed to kill" in military service, there is no reason that it should be illegal to go plinking on the gun range, or drink beer.

141 2018-05-07 21:53:13 Oh no. It couldn't be. This is worse than murderer! How can anyone treat a king's messenger with respect the size of a pinch of sand, and put him in these stocks!

142 2018-05-07 21:52:48 I doubt that the only analysis that Ms. Bloom did was to buy whatever stocks the lawyers bought. I imagine that she also did her own analysis as well.
143 2018-05-07 21:52:41 Danny, you have to trade these stocks. Keep banking profit. Imm has great movements.
144 2018-05-07 21:52:29 The market as a whole may be overvalued. However, there are plenty of stocks trading well below their historical P/E.
145 2018-05-07 21:52:05 People really gotta stop caring about what Warren Buffett says about crypto. No disrespect to the GOAT, but he's already admitted he does not like to own stocks in companies whose business he does not understand.
146 2018-05-07 21:51:45 The same control rule was installed by Harper, in the federal management structure. Employees who didn't obey, like world renowned experts, were fired or retired. Years of research data - climate, oceans, fish stocks - were also destroyed. No data + no expert = no opposition.

148 2018-05-07 21:47:37 Wrong, I’m on the left and own a gun- a 380 Sig Sauer that I keep for protection. How about this-ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Make background checks mandatory, no loopholes. Did I say take all guns away, no! That is what the right jumps to when you offer solutions

157 2018-05-07 21:39:53 I'm afraid that it is never quite that simple. After seeing 5 or 6 cycles, it is much easier intellectually to buy stocks when they are "cheap" than it is in practice due to levels of fear at those times.
158 2018-05-07 21:38:10 But the company is making so MUCH MONEY now. Literally they have made more money than the attitude era with decisions like this, not even incuding that their stocks are the highest theyve ever been. More Carmella, more double dick kick finishes, more Roman, equals more MONEY.

161 2018-05-07 21:35:48 I said if it didn't have the license. Never said anything about the stock price. People were saying it was a scam since 3 cents then it went to 80 cents in a very hot market. Learn how stocks work mate otherwise you'll keep tweeting your feelings that no one cares about.

Bump stocks and assault weapons caused and then magnified the carnage at Las Vegas.

No mental health issue there. Just plain guns and accessories that need to go.

258 2018-05-07 20:36:11 A nice day, but stocks were well off their highs. The Dow closed up 95 off its early advance of 217. Oil was king today touching above $70 a bbl and both elevated and frightened the market. Oil stocks rallied then faded the rest rather neutral. Breadth both about 1.8 to 1.
259 2018-05-07 20:35:47 Women I’ve dated always ask my to teach them about stocks. They don’t really be bout it; they just think it’s cool that I know about it. My next girl gotta be about that shit

262 2018-05-07 20:34:05 "I believe in the Constitution as written."  

You mean the part of the 2nd Amendment that clearly states that civilians can own assault-type rifles with bump stocks & 30-round magazines?
263 2018-05-07 20:33:53 Junior lithium and cobalt stocks can't get up off the mat yet in Q1 18, automakers in US sold more than 54,000 EVs, up 32% YoY.  Europe and Asia usually higher than US but don't have those stats this moment.
264 2018-05-07 20:33:09 I wish we could put them in stocks. Any act of public shaming, really, though these leeches are immune to shame.

276 2018-05-07 20:20:46 If alt-coin is defined as alternative money, bitcoin used to fit this description (and arguably still does). If alt-coin is defined as a crypto alternative to bitcoin it's a self definition. Last, 'trading' anything (crypto, forex, stocks, baseball cards etc) is a gamble.

286 2018-05-07 20:12:07 World stocks higher: Europe +.6%; US +.4%. Friday's good labor news carried over &. combined with rising oil prices gave market a  lift. However, carried too far could spike inflation & spook market. High volatility & sideways market in short-term. Better after election.
287 2018-05-07 20:11:06 U.S. stocks end higher, but trim gains as energy rally fades
288 2018-05-07 20:10:48 AFTERNOON MARKET WATCH: US stocks close solidly higher. Dow advances 95 points. Energy stocks and oil prices pare their gains after President Trump tweets that Iran nuclear decision will be announced on Tuesday. ~ M

292 2018-05-07 20:09:41 They both gamble. One on cards, one on stocks. How's that "…easy question. NEXT" attitude working out for ya?
293 2018-05-07 20:09:29 Still, I have to ask the question about deeming the value of US stocks if they leave the country and declare bonafide residency somewhere else. That would eliminate the need for any wait to receive the status. They should benchmark other countries.
294 2018-05-07 20:09:06 Stocks gain but end off highs as Trump says will announce Iran decision Tues.  Dow +94, +0.4% to 24,356. Nasdaq +0.8%, S&P +0.3%. 

Oil acts as if Trump will hit Iranian crude exports: US oil +0.1% to $69.80 after trading as high as $70.84, three-yr high.

303 2018-05-07 20:04:41 Sorry, I just read below where you said it was only US stocks. I could see where this could lead to double tax in countries that tax residence on global income. The treasury will need to adjust the tax treaties.

316 2018-05-07 19:55:13 Bailing on tech stocks!!
317 2018-05-07 19:54:40 A tactic that has done me well in traditional stocks since 2008 is dollar cost averaging. Not a single #memeTriangle in sight.

319 2018-05-07 19:52:59 sharp selling in uranium-leveraged stocks this afternoon. Someone's decided it's time to get out.
320 2018-05-07 19:52:42 Like all of your initiatives had an immediate impact… Although I have seen an immediate impact on my 401(k)! I’m sure your retirement package has done well too as well as the many stocks you probably own Sen Schmucker
321 2018-05-07 19:51:29 Man Gucci gotta give @lilpump a contract yo. His shitty ass song got their stocks thru the roof
322 2018-05-07 19:50:33 Stocks continue to hold gains though off best levels. Mortgage Bonds flat in listless trading. 10-yr barely moves at 2.95%.
323 2018-05-07 19:49:23 So do I but probably not constitutional. I’ll take stronger background  and red flag laws, ban assault weapons and bump stocks, restrict magazine size, raise age limits some certification of knowledge and child safety requirements (similar to how we regulate vehicles)
324 2018-05-07 19:49:19 Stocks will probably still go up though

326 2018-05-07 19:48:24 Id like to hope so, but Buffett doesnt do well with tech stocks and Gates aggressively acquired his competitors instead of inventing new technology in house, so despite their successes, I am not sure if their skill sets and strategies would permit them to be successful in ur hypo
327 2018-05-07 19:47:26 Time to short #stocks with US on Collison course with #Iran.  There is a real chance for war unfortunately #Nasdaq

335 2018-05-07 19:44:34 I am assuming the 90% that you are referring to here are the around 90% of businesses that either didn't do a damn thing or bought back stocks after the #taxscambill was passed?

Even @marcorubio came out and spoke the truth. The #TaxScam is not working as intended. #MN02
336 2018-05-07 19:44:30 "These physical assets tend to shine during the later stages of economic recoveries, as demand builds and overwhelms supply. Raw materials do much better than stocks during such periods, Goldman Sachs asserts."
337 2018-05-07 19:44:25 While Buffet & Munger blab on about the wonders of stocks, they fail to mention that buying & trading stocks is regulated by Gvt & controlled by NWO entities, while buying & selling tangible commodities such as Au & Ag do not need government approval or regulatory intervention.
338 2018-05-07 19:43:42 I'm feeling your pain fella, sorry for your loss. Makes a good point to bring back the stocks and let people chuck shit and piss at the thieving cunts for a month or two. #bikethievingscum

To which I reply “have you ever bought stocks?”
342 2018-05-07 19:40:50 There are many other Billionaires who disagree with him on this subject. Just because he is great at picking stocks it doesn't mean he knows all markets. He's just not getting Crypto . That's it.
343 2018-05-07 19:40:22 @timothysykes even though I don’t have any day trades left, I love watching these stocks spike 50 to 100% or more. It really makes me wanna study more lol

The Dow is up 170 pts.  Chevron, Exxon, Apple all trading higher.
347 2018-05-07 19:35:53 I've seen some farmers placing that in their stocks and it's working out for them,because those who steals them get arrested. I guess if it's done on animals it can be done on humans. But I believe their measures that can be put in place to prevent this issues besides tracker.

351 2018-05-07 19:34:16 I hope 2 years from now I’m in a position to invest. Whether it be stocks or a business, something.
352 2018-05-07 19:34:16 Or the stocks. x
353 2018-05-07 19:32:15 CNBC has been slobbing Buffett's knob all day about $AAPL. I like Buffett's investing approach and own a lot of stocks that he owns, but $AAPL is 1-2 product cycles away from decline. He won't make money LT on $AAPL, you heard it here first. At least he didn't invest in $TSLA.
354 2018-05-07 19:31:54 Oil Stocks selling off on announcement that President @realDonaldTrump will announce his decision on Iran tomorrow afternoon...
355 2018-05-07 19:31:40 I'm looking Mark, i always encourage anyone if they have or see stocks of interest to share, usually they send them to me after its up quite a bit or they frontloaded the hound out of it, lol, but still a trade is a trade, you must tread the otc softly.
356 2018-05-07 19:31:29 Essa história de apps universais me deu uma esperança de ver mais apps do iPhone no iPad e no Mac (tipo Weather e Stocks). Passou da hora de ter Calculadora no iPad.
357 2018-05-07 19:31:07 Okkkkkk...opinions are like belly buttons, everybody has one and...for every bull there is a bear. Global stocks are in decline amidst growing demand. So, this week's bearish slant is just another ripple along the way. We already know it. Futures are the future
358 2018-05-07 19:31:02 Nope, I’ve heard nothing. No doubt we’ll put something together as soon as we hear.

367 2018-05-07 19:26:26 I thought Munger lives in California!  In my view, the Buffett system of franchises and moats would of found Google.  I just don’t think they were looking for tech stocks:  they assumed the franchises wouldn’t be sustained.  A number of tech franchises have endured.
368 2018-05-07 19:26:18 I would buy Amazon over Microsoft stocks also. @BillGates
369 2018-05-07 19:26:16 A #TTFI qualified non-resident invests in local/foreign stocks, capital gains on sales of foreign stock are considered as foreign-source income, not subject to US taxation/tax returns. Yes to your 2nd question. Also see my answer to @Tonyrinthailand 6 hrs ago.

375 2018-05-07 19:23:22 The story I heard on the radio is her supervisor/boss would have her buy stocks for him, she in turn would make a little buy of same stock for herself. Over time it adds up.

378 2018-05-07 19:21:53 That’s not what we’ve seen. When tax rates drop large companies buy back stocks increasing the share price thus allowing for more compensation for shareholders and management.
379 2018-05-07 19:21:42 @AOTtrades I hate when it takes a nose dive around 3pm...stocks start to turn down
380 2018-05-07 19:21:22 I trade stocks that are spiking down faster. Most people will trade the spike up but I do the opposite. Honestly, You need to find your own stocks. Focus, have daily charts/weekly charts/monthly charts.. find support resistance is key and take your own trades.

385 2018-05-07 19:19:24 The anti gun crowd is extremely uninformed. They are constantly repeating completely debunked talking points, they want to ban things like telescoping stocks, like being able to adjust the rifle to the correct LOP without using a but pad makes it deadlier. That is uninformed.
386 2018-05-07 19:19:19 Watch the oil stocks , oil prices and who's benefitting from this new fiasco
387 2018-05-07 19:18:39 Anytime they drag out Buffet to tout stocks, you have to question the value of the market, we were correcting nicely and naturally. I smell a distribution choppy top.
388 2018-05-07 19:18:29 1000s of stocks have $multi-billion market caps and are loaded with debt. Just because you "produce" something doesnt mean your worth anything. Things can have value without producing anything. Ever hear of a diamond @BillGates ?

390 2018-05-07 19:18:08 A great role for @luisjgomez would be him playing a janitor who answers a question that Axelrod asks his team that they can’t answer. Then he somehow knows a ton about stocks and gets hired to trade only to get fired for attacking someone for eating his lunch.
391 2018-05-07 19:17:25 Oil stocks have erased all the gains (since this morning) after Trump’s Iran tweet
392 2018-05-07 19:16:56 @WarrenBuffett hinted that he is keeping an eye on $AMZN an $GOOGL. Both of these 2 stocks are great long term stocks to hold. Better than $AAPL imo.

397 2018-05-07 19:12:52 Position sizing refers to the size of each trade. If you trade futures this could mean the number of contracts. Stocks, mutual funds, and exchange traded funds that could mean the percentage of available equity used for each position. This is how QiT allocates position size.

400 2018-05-07 19:11:44 Buying or selling stocks or commodities based upon what you believe @realdonaldtrump will say or actually says is a fool's game.

He will make a statement with so many holes that he can walk through it in both directions and exercise deniability or feign victory.
401 2018-05-07 19:11:41 You will have to purchase the report to get the individual stock names. They’re undervalued growth stocks that big competitors and peers within their sectors could easily finance their acquisitions.

405 2018-05-07 19:10:47 There is no reason to end the deal unless you are either 1) trying to distract us, 2) want to start a war, or 3) you have stocks in oil. Since you took office the price of oil has gone up about $30 per barrel and fuel has gone up over  $1 per gallon. The people suffer cuz of you!

421 2018-05-07 19:04:29 I know you don't need bump stocks to bump a fire weapon. But they make a semi automatic rifle simulate the rapid firing of a full automatic weapon. And (in my opinion) no one needs something, that can kill so many in a minute.

445 2018-05-07 18:54:13 Indeed, in the current bump stock regulation docket the ATF already admits rubber bands and belt loops are viable alternatives to bump stocks, so the next logical step is to ban anything capable of bump firing (i.e. all semi-autos) by using constructive intent to prosecute.

463 2018-05-07 18:42:29 I couldn’t care less about bump stocks.  They enable a shooter to fire faster than the optimum rate of fire for an AR, leading to malfunctions and even damage to the gun.  They don’t enable faster target acquisition but delay it.

510 2018-05-07 18:12:29 I'll use an analogy.  The same reason gun people don't want bump stocks banned.  It opens the door for future bans.  Truth is, most gun owners don't want, have one or need bumps stocks.  I worked in a gun store 4 years.  Saw 2 and no one ever ordered one. Make sense?

524 2018-05-07 18:03:48 Fair enough. Though a lot of investments don't have any carrying costs (like stocks), right? Just seems like comparing property tax rates across cities/provinces isn't as straightforward as, say, income tax rates, given the wide variance in avg property values.
525 2018-05-07 18:02:50 What confounds me is the libs would gladly give up their recent tax advantages, the increases in their stocks and 401K's and those of them who actually got a job because of POTUS's economic policies... just to get rid of him by any means! Or, have they not figured it out yet?

559 2018-05-07 17:50:36 Okay, I use my card for a purchase... if I’d used cash I’d get change back right? Well the idea is that the “change” goes into investing. Example: I pay 1.50 for an item.. acorns matches .50 and invests it for you to go into stocks/bonds.

777 2018-05-07 15:59:16 Due to lot of hidden NPAs and mindless loan waiver schemes, Buying PSU Bank stocks is like jumping off the plane without a parachute.

778 2018-05-07 15:59:03 I would choose investing in cryptocurrency over investing in the stock market any day, not enough profit in stocks anymore.
779 2018-05-07 15:58:47 We've reached the point where tech should selloff 15% but everyone knows select stocks will appreciate 50% in 2-3 years.
780 2018-05-07 15:58:43 Sreenidhi bhai full concentration on SME segment. Any stocks worth accumulation at current price? Both SME and main board?
781 2018-05-07 15:56:58 The difference between the bid and ask for dummies... if the stocks moving put on ask you will get more $$$.  If the stock is stagnant you may have to sell into the bid. $tcel is on fire why would you sell into the bid... smh 19s gonna be up soon
782 2018-05-07 15:56:15 I also dont believe that most stocks are a store of value more than an investment, where you risk losing parts of your capital to make money. 

I'd say things like gold and silver are more of a store of value due to their long existence and its intrinsic value.
783 2018-05-07 15:56:15 When the private sector makes their money off of OUR military going to war so their stocks go up after they sell more weapons, they can fix OUR pipes.  That’s the least they can do.
784 2018-05-07 15:54:25 When the private sector makes their money by influencing our politicians  to have wars so their stocks go up, they have a responsibility then to help the people because they make all of their money off of OUR military going to war.  Fix the Flint Pipes, you fucking billionaires!
785 2018-05-07 15:52:27 Stocks up and $VIX up. Hmm.

787 2018-05-07 15:51:41 yes, wait until mundra issue is resolved .. stocks like tata power are to be accumulated very slowly for ultra long term if at all .. can ignore in most cases ..

789 2018-05-07 15:49:53 They publish stupid report of 18% tax on Insurance products and insurance stocks tanked. But nothing happened. Kotak views are stupid
790 2018-05-07 15:49:11 Wall Street analysts loving the big number of energy stocks on the 52-week high list, but consumers won't if trend continues. Commodity cost spikes gonna get passed on to consumers for sure in many ways.
791 2018-05-07 15:47:57 Have you seen the moviepass twitter account? Ever since they changed the terms (no repeats) it’s been snarky comments, rude reply’s, and moronic posts from the official account all day long. I’m sure that’ll help improve stocks #baitandswitch

793 2018-05-07 15:45:36 Agree 100% on the tone and the growth hormones, there are no differences between conventional and organic on that one. Also factually incorrect, organic cows CAN be treated with antibiotics - welfare always comes first - quite rightly. Dreadful piece of writing.

798 2018-05-07 15:41:41 We need to ban AR-15 & bump stocks
We need to pass universal background checks & close the gun show loophole
We need to make sure those with a history of violent crimes cannot get guns
This is about keeping children safe in schools, keep people safe on the streets and communities

806 2018-05-07 15:35:11 I know @DLoesch and gang want you to think the goal is to repeal the 2nd. It's not, we just want normal people who own guns to agree that crazy people, wife beaters, terrorists, etc shouldn't buy guns. Background checks, no high capacity magazines, no bump stocks.
That's not hard
807 2018-05-07 15:33:50 Wall Street tries to blur the lines between what crypto is, and what stocks are so they can claim to be experts on crypto.

Crypto fuels it by getting excited when they tease the media with involvement. 

We’re different, don’t let them fool you.
808 2018-05-07 15:33:01 Hey Schmucky - anyone with a 401K benefits from share repurchases. Anyone with a pension fund that invests in stocks benefits from share repurchases, the economy overall benefits as excess capital is re-allocated. You're a financial illiterate.

844 2018-05-07 15:14:49 Since its introduction as a civilian weapon especially following the end of the #AssaultWeaponsBan, the AR-15 has been modified and after-market options increase its lethality while still technically being legal under the guise of being "semi-automatic".

873 2018-05-07 14:58:00 The people claiming “crypto has more scams” than traditional markets have never traded OTC/penny stocks. And the worst part is, the people participating in these stocks believe they’re playing in a regulated space. 

Regulation keeps people and markets dumb over time.

876 2018-05-07 14:57:17 Why do most hold onto bad #crypto or #stocks picks too long?

Not because they believe they’ll go back up.
Not because they can’t handle the loss.
But because they’re afraid to watch it rise after they sold.

Cut your attachments as quickly as your losses.
You’ll be just fine.

880 2018-05-07 14:56:39 But “assault rifles” are already illegal and bump stocks don’t account for any crimes other than that jackwagon in Vegas. It’s simply a gimmicky piece of plastic. One can do the same action with a belt loop and finger. Its a feel good political target and nothing more.
881 2018-05-07 14:56:36 Most recent terror attacks in this country: Vegas, Parkland, Waffle House, Texas Church; mostly carried out by white men with assault weapons. Think of that, in these very dangerous times...not even a ban on bump stocks.

907 2018-05-07 14:44:01 I've seen this phenomenon in the oil and gas space in the past as well where early in the cycle you see a handful of large cap stocks that are well know take off first, and then the smaller cap, higher leveraged names follow.

925 2018-05-07 14:33:26 The point here is there are options strategies out there that will lead to certain gains as long as the stocks moves up or down.  When $AAPL goes overbought/oversold, it moves up or down with a near certainty.  You almost never get sideways trading in overbought/oversold cond.

931 2018-05-07 14:29:01 SalSac is a loop hole that avoids NI. That's why it's used. So, rather than charging NI on pension imcome, the logical first step (if any) is to remove SalSac to emoyee benefits that qualify. 

NOT do a tax grab on funds, large proportions of which have already had NI charged.

1100 2018-05-07 13:18:42 One thing I don't see is "unfettered optimism" (love that word). Perhaps it is because bulls don't see a catalyst for a prolonged run in stocks or perhaps it is because those who had that optimism are a bit gun shy from being slapped around in 2018. $SPX $NDX $IWM

1148 2018-05-07 12:49:15 I never really understood how an etf crisis wd be distinguished from a general crisis / bear mkt in stocks
1149 2018-05-07 12:48:51 U.S. stocks finished the week on a high note as a strong Apple rally outweighed concerns over China, Iran and a weaker-than-expected jobs report.
1150 2018-05-07 12:47:44 Keying on Warren Buffett talking about wanting to buy more Apple and hoping it pulls back much more than it has. Newer investors won't understand the thought process, but they will panic and sell Mr. Buffett their shares when that happens. #apple #WarrenBuffett #stocks

1154 2018-05-07 12:45:58 Well said Brian,a lot of folk been spoon fed stories on how the EU and the CFP saved the fish stocks,we know the real truth and that why we want out of the CFP and its only the Tories that have that mindset

1162 2018-05-07 12:42:27 It doesn’t even say that they were a corporate firm, let alone that the stocks they were purchasing were from their clients, let alone that they used insider information gleaned from their clients. You’ve made more than a couple logical leaps here.
1163 2018-05-07 12:42:23 Fascinating. Educate me on what lies about the NRA I am believing? Is it their compulsive need to reject any gun control policy not matter how reasonable it is like background checks, waiting periods and the banning of bump stocks?
1164 2018-05-07 12:42:11 No, I’m being serious, I mean seek some education into trading Forex or stocks...
1165 2018-05-07 12:42:10 Why do you think bump stocks are a good idea for anyone to have access to?
1166 2018-05-07 12:41:54 If thousands or millions of people pull their money out of bank stocks and invest the money in Bitcoin, what will happen to Buffett's share in those stocks? This is why Bitcoin is bad. It threatens the banks which Buffett owns large stocks in.
1167 2018-05-07 12:40:20 Remember when cable news ran fluff stories during the day and reported on stocks, random news and topics of the day? It's almost like remember life pre 9/11. Now it's remember life pre Trump. #cnn #MSNBC #rememberwhen #simplertimes #pretrump
1168 2018-05-07 12:40:07 I think one of the greatest revelations in investing at my advanced age was to use a probabilistic mathematical model that says to buy stocks when the market price is heavily discounted to their intrinsic value. This counters my investor irrationality.
1169 2018-05-07 12:39:37 He also isn't a fan of cyclicals like the semis. They go from value stocks to traps and aren't great long term holds which is his strategy.
1170 2018-05-07 12:39:25 He did nothing about school shootings he signed off on bump stocks being legal. He ruined healthcare in this nation. But yeah tan suit whatever libs

1173 2018-05-07 12:38:15 What happened to taking people's guns away and asking questions later? What happened to you saying you were going to ban bump stocks? You are the NRAs slave. They own you.
1174 2018-05-07 12:38:02 I think gop congress should take responsibility for their oversight failure of 45. It time to make them answer tough questions & find out how they occupy their time when hiding from constituents. What stocks do they have & when was their last ethics check in?
1175 2018-05-07 12:36:43 Opening guest on @FoxBusiness with @Varneyco at 9am ET today! Tune in to hear about stocks and trade moving markets.
1176 2018-05-07 12:35:43 Exactly, they are in charge of fishing the seas out, it is politicians who are in charge of managing the fish stocks, hence the CFP.
1177 2018-05-07 12:35:42 certain stock sectors at that. he admittedly missed on Google and Amazon and is generally weak in the tech sector. beyond stocks, his reactionary stance on the emerging crypto space is slowly being proven to be wrong.
1178 2018-05-07 12:34:35 Breaking news: Warren Buffett likes stocks for the long term.
1179 2018-05-07 12:33:19 The fisherman are not in charge of managing the fishing stocks.
1180 2018-05-07 12:32:15 It’s a waste of time debating gun control. Until there is an anti NRA lobby group with huge cash reserves nothing will change. 
It’s all about money. Arguing about your rights and school safety and bump stocks is a waste of time 
You are being played for fools
1181 2018-05-07 12:32:14 But not on salary sacrificed conts. Do we need NI on employer conts as well as on pay?

1184 2018-05-07 12:29:55 I agree on that, the market is so volatile despite it being a 9 year bull market, a full correction is due soon. I pulled most of my stocks except for tech sector because it's over performed despite corrections
1185 2018-05-07 12:29:25 *but
1186 2018-05-07 12:29:12 NI has already been charged where personal contributions have been made. Most employees pay in this way. 

Care system needs sorting bit taking NI twice isn't fair.
1187 2018-05-07 12:27:56 But those who didn't pay be salary sacrifice did, and would therefore pay NI twice.... Which would be the majority of employees
1188 2018-05-07 12:26:37 I’m trying to get back into stocks, but for now just crypto.
1189 2018-05-07 12:26:10 Do you own regular stocks and bonds or solely crypto currency?

1193 2018-05-07 12:24:39 It is also important to distinguish between actual rice stocks and NFA stocks. 

The NFA only imports when local supplies are insufficient to satisfy local demand and the recommended buffer stock - as defined by the NFA council.
1194 2018-05-07 12:24:37 I sympathise and I think the stocks on Wall Street might be a good idea. Can't agree to capital punishment, however. The rest of us hopefully won't need to stoop to the level of these disgusting murderers.

1210 2018-05-07 12:15:56 If CEOs get compensated the same per-employee while executing huge mergers and acquisitions, they're going to get enormous pay at high ratio. Like $100 for each of 8,000 is under $1M, but $50 for each of 50,000 employees is $2.5M. Stocks don't count; they're just fake inflation.

1228 2018-05-07 12:04:32 Oh but during his term, NFA rice stocks didn't get depleted, inflation reached historically low levels, and business confidence was at an all-time high. Aquino could've done better of course, but he got a good hold of the fundamentals at least.
1229 2018-05-07 12:04:28 Primarily because stocks are held & traded no longer by little fish but by billionaire fat cats. Goliath traders using Goliath brokers!

1230 2018-05-07 12:03:35 To investors in $GILD & $CELG:

I'm not a big fan of buybacks in the biopharma industry as a means for returning capital, but it's hard to blame management when their stocks are this cheap.

1236 2018-05-07 12:00:54 because there’s only one thing he previously didn’t see value in: technology. it changes so fast (100% upgrade every two years on average) he thought in the long term its hard to stay on top, therefor those stocks will be more volatile than others.

1239 2018-05-07 11:59:20 The most surprising part of the story is that the accused didn’t lock himself into the stocks.

1247 2018-05-07 11:54:17 The NRA supporters tend to get shrill.

1254 2018-05-07 11:48:23 The wages will only rise if the IRS implements the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which requires employers to invest in their employees and create jobs. This hasn’t happened yet.

1639 2018-05-07 04:30:01 I dont think you have the full context. The employees clearly knew it was a mistake (SS was supposed to distribute 2.3m USD of company stocks as part of employee compensation not 110b USD worth) and they didn't report the irregularities but instead decided to trade on it.
1640 2018-05-07 04:29:37 its going to make our lives hell.  maybe the trade will continue only in Index futures and not in stocks. As there would be a wide gap in cash and F&O in the next trading session. But, the Exchanges have to make their framework

This is nothing more than an incremental gun ban based on a single event.

1650 2018-05-07 04:19:40 Below 10720, Nifty looks sell for 10640. 

Around 10620-640, Nifty looks buy for 10680-700. 

Break on either side, creates new move.

1674 2018-05-07 03:57:09 You have to get a more relevant, intelligent argument. Do you really think asking people if they want their kids to be killed is an effective approach? It has nothing to do with BACKGROUND CHECKS AND BANNING BUMPS STOCKS AND SILENCERS.

1681 2018-05-07 03:47:22 Call is for ban on semi-automatic weapons, real background checks, ban bump stocks. <Fact...  NRA is claiming they are coming for your guns. This is fake news. They use it to collect money and get people motivated. SAD.
1682 2018-05-07 03:47:13 Good everyone realized that MF is better than FD. I pray they more quickly realize that directly buying stocks is lot more better than MF.

1683 2018-05-07 03:46:33 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U.

1745 2018-05-07 02:52:05 My regs? Universal background checks, including private sales. Ban bump stocks. Heightened training on weapons that kill highly efficiently. Perhaps, someone like the requirements on pre1986 fully autos, where a police officer had to sign off.

1826 2018-05-07 01:51:54 There has been no stimulation yet,  and I can assure you there probably won’t be. Companies are buying back their stocks, not sharing their windfall. Companies are not raising salaries, nor is min8mum wage going up. Prices are increasing

1895 2018-05-07 00:21:08 I'm tired of the propaganda. No sane person preaches "gun confiscation" it's about banning bump stocks which is unnecessary to have. Banning assault rifles which was banned from 1994-2005 until congress was bribed to repeal. This isn't about taking guns from good citizens
1896 2018-05-07 00:20:44 Your where probably too drunk to realise the duty free is free from thai duties for thais or burmese. All the goods have come transit through thailand. And those guard post are not the Tatmadaw. And there is no one in stocks.

Always twist what these guys says and you will get their real intentions. They are pretty consistent liars. Buy Bitcoin now and sell them the moment he says I was wrong you should buy btc.

1902 2018-05-07 00:14:30 Considering all the buybacks that billionaires & corporations did with their HUGE tax cuts,you'd think it would be much higher.Also,half the country doesn't invest in stocks,so it's not even a good indicator of how Americans are doing. It's a measure of how 30 companies are doing

1904 2018-05-07 00:11:28 Agreed.  

2x in my life I received legit 6-figure lump sums.  

I ended up putting a massive down payment on a new house and invested the rest in stocks.  Still drove a toyota SUV the whole time.  
1905 2018-05-07 00:11:12 I'm okay with that since bump stocks are designed for inaccurate fire which isn't particularly useful against corrupt government agents.

1909 2018-05-07 00:07:44 Bump stocks are unneeded and exceedingly dangerous. Not opposed to them going bye bye at all.
1910 2018-05-07 00:06:45 Ofcourse they want you to buy and fomo into their stocks with your hard earned money which they have accumulated with printed money and will be more than happy to sell you to buy your sweat and blood. It is your money and be wise. Do not listen to ANYONE.

1915 2018-05-07 00:02:17 Man, seriously, why not using the marth-killer? You missed a lot of edgeguards that could be easy stocks by using it.
1916 2018-05-07 00:00:29 Penny stocks can move really quickly and be easily manipulated 

The easiest thing for a MM to do, is trip the Bid and take out everyone's stop-losses driving the stock down where they can pick shares to cover or hold for long position

Don't use stop losses
1917 2018-05-07 00:00:26 fuck trading style, this is how penny stocks pump work; it's like you debating me whether or not it gets dark at night or if the sun comes up int eh morning, but you boneheads are too dumb to see it...lose big then you'll learn and have a better attitude with me, apology accepted
