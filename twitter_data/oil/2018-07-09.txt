2 2018-07-09 23:59:24 There is no compelling national security reason to incentivize oil companies to keep inventory in the ground rather than pump it. Our reserves are plentiful. We are a net exporter. This is a $6B gift to the oil company.

38 2018-07-09 23:56:38 maybe you need an oil change or you blew a fuse or two and they need to be replaced. Just take you apart and replace the broken bits, but im already in line for it
39 2018-07-09 23:56:20 breakfast: fried eggs w a pound of hot sauce, lunch/dinner:stir fried tofu w kimchi (lots of chili oil)
40 2018-07-09 23:56:15 You simply don’t get the tax code. Oil companies spend millions of their OWN money and then deduct some in taxes. That is not a subsidy of any sort. It’s what all businesses do. As to national security you think planes run on solar and wind ?? You are totally clueless
41 2018-07-09 23:56:13 Bathrooms in really nice restaurants are torture!  Elaborate Soap, diffusers, potpourri, etc etc.  and I’m always surprised that SunLife has strong oil diffusers at register.
42 2018-07-09 23:56:00 No thats the fact that like 95% of their economy was based on said oil.  As if we arent much more diverse.   Try looking at demsoc countries like Denmark or Finland for better examples.

47 2018-07-09 23:55:18 No oil company considers Afghanistan as an oil or gas deposit.

Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world - it can't even fund its army. 

The US is still there because Military contractors are raking in billions. They forced Trump to stay as they did Obama.
48 2018-07-09 23:55:14 She nodded and hugged him.
49 2018-07-09 23:54:52 I can ask my sister if you are serious? You want oil on canvas or some other media?

52 2018-07-09 23:54:14 Probably Rapeseed which is what Canola oil is made from. A deadly plant but beautiful!
53 2018-07-09 23:54:04 If they pay less than other businesses, they benefit unfairly at taxpayers' expense.

There are compelling national security reasons to incentivize emerging technologies, so no, you don't get to "whatabout" on solar or EV.

There is no compelling reason to subsidize oil. None.
54 2018-07-09 23:54:04 Man so much Im doin a hot oil treatment rn lol
55 2018-07-09 23:54:02 They better enjoy it while they can.  The world has been sucking the Arab's oil test for over a century ... last one with the oil wind and we've only begun to tap our resources.  I wonder how the sand market is . . .
56 2018-07-09 23:53:56 #Meniscus. Key in the shape of this Knee structure is it’s Shape.#KLAPPERVISION it looks like a rubber washer or gasket for your car’s oil pain. It helps keep the fluid inside the joint.This fluid allows for Bones to Glide WITHOUT Friction!

63 2018-07-09 23:52:37 Venezuela's 20th century capitalist oil boom, strangled by corruption and ended in disaster and all those  slums around Caracas etc. 21st century socialist attempt to fix it also sunk by corruption. Where the hell do they go now? Pass the beer is right!
64 2018-07-09 23:52:36 But then, @POTUS has sold weapons to Ukraine, complained that Germany buys oil & gas from Russia, and has kept up sanctions. @statedeptspox @ChiefPentSpox @PressSec

70 2018-07-09 23:51:40 I am prepared to eat roaches, when America falls all the way down ... I've been waiting for it to happen, I've been wanting for it to happen, and; I am willing to suffer the consequences of it happening. 
People eat roaches in Asia (ironically) ... they fry them in vegetable oil.

72 2018-07-09 23:51:37 People are talking about oil at $150-250 if #iran blocks the #straitofhormuz. Maybe that will move everyone over to clean energy despite the dumb tariffs we slapped on solar panels and the like
73 2018-07-09 23:51:35 "I wanted to help him because he seemed worried."
74 2018-07-09 23:51:20 In other news, the National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative has rebranded as the Carbon Capture Coalition. It's latest member .org is The Nature Conservancy. With half a dozen labor groups on board you guys should be hella-concerned. #keepitintheground #shutitdown #45Q #EOR

80 2018-07-09 23:50:46 Let’s hope big oil remembers next presidential election who to donate to....
81 2018-07-09 23:50:25 The oil company gets no money from the govt. They simply get to deduct expenses. It’s solar companies and the scam called Tesla that are leeches off the Govt. Attack them and you have a point
82 2018-07-09 23:50:24 昨日の千羽鶴のお話、「ひどい」「こんなことしたらダメ」などのリプが届いてますが、その気持ちが大事だと思う。あとはそれを言える勇気と「被害者の口の中に黒い折り鶴が入れられてる連続殺人事件発生案件」などの想像力。
83 2018-07-09 23:50:14 This group that traveled secretly to Russia on 4th of July to INSULT AMERICA'S INDEPENDENCE DAY went there to get campaign money in exchange for giving Russia access to oil pipeline,military bases and vote tampering. U sold Americans out for money.On 4th of July! Vote Them Out!

86 2018-07-09 23:49:38 @cenkuygur  What would Jesus do? Well, he'd be fucked, his illiterate mother being discouraged by the state to breastfeed, trying to feed him with some snake oil seller formula mixed with contaminated water... He wouldn't have made it to that mountain... #tytlive
87 2018-07-09 23:49:24 palm kernel oil very good and cheap
88 2018-07-09 23:49:23 I wonder, when Davis penned, "Thou anointest my head with oil" (Psalm 23:5) was he remembering the anointings of Samuel, Judah, and Israel or when God used Nathan to cut him in his sinful pride over his Adultery & Murder?

(1 Samuel 16:3; 2 Samuel 2:4 & 5:3 or 12:7?)
89 2018-07-09 23:49:16 Lucas Oil Stadium tour today was pretty cool. Needed to get my mind off things for a little.

97 2018-07-09 23:48:21 Yeah Mia get ya hand down in that oil queen.
98 2018-07-09 23:48:19 I am here all day for the Subway sandwich artist that blew the vegan’s mind when he told her mayonnaise has eggs in it.

102 2018-07-09 23:47:46 We are looking forward to them getting their license. It’s lonely being the only one in Canada licensed solely for cannabis oil production  . There is great potential for collaboration and partnership with up and coming extractors. #welcometotheparty
103 2018-07-09 23:47:43 Try vitamin D oil and or Bio Oil.
Ambre solar aftersun with Alo Vera is a good moisturiser
104 2018-07-09 23:47:31 You might not know this, oil companies are winding down operations in some areas in the Niger Delta.

106 2018-07-09 23:47:29 that's a ton of shit no way I could have gone through all of that in 5 days. I got 2 grams a chocolate bar a thing of gummies and one drink and couldn't finish that. Plus @KateAllDay was an angelface as is natural to her and gifted me some oil cartridges
107 2018-07-09 23:47:26 What is it going to be then?  bc it looks like teens and many women are about to go back to the old coat hanger, castor oil, and god knows what else methods!
108 2018-07-09 23:47:17 How to plunder oil from countries: force them to rack up huge debt, relentlessly sell bonds, cut oil investment funds, spike the oil prices, force them to capitulate oil assets as payment. If all else fails, raid them.
109 2018-07-09 23:46:49 DeirEzzor: ISIS captured several oil wells east of al-Herigy town in the northern countryside after an attack on SDF militia locations in the area

112 2018-07-09 23:46:43 Retire
113 2018-07-09 23:46:10 Because it raises the price of the rest of the oil
114 2018-07-09 23:46:01 I just want to be slathered in CBD oil.
115 2018-07-09 23:45:36 Not this Libertarian. The CIA overthrew the elected government of Iran in 1953 for oil. The U.S. installed the Shah for oil. The Iranian people ousted the Shah so the U.S, backed Saddam to fight Iran for oil. I can’t imagine why Iranians hate  the US or it’s Mideast proxy Israel.

127 2018-07-09 23:44:13 No the one word you are looking for is     GREED. Big oil wants to make money and they do not care if they pay less then market value per barrel they will charge their prices on market price per barrel.
128 2018-07-09 23:44:08 31 oil filters changed today

195 2018-07-09 23:34:34 Ah, now starts the ad hominem.

Oil depletion allowance is about a recognized asset already "in inventory". This is not about exploration, it's about paying the oil company to keep it in the ground instead of pumping it into barrels. It's a clear giveaway.

240 2018-07-09 23:26:45 You did not read up on oil depletion allowance, did you? Or the fact that the write-off can exceed the value of the asset? This is spending through the tax code, favoring one business over another. Failing a compelling national security reason, this is corporate welfare.

432 2018-07-09 22:59:30 Did you know that you can reuse our small essential oil bottles? I love to use them as cane toppers in the garden!

436 2018-07-09 22:58:47 Point is could undo much of the price rise if US rejoined JCPOA and lifted sanctions against Iran. Then 2 million b/d of Iranian oil exports would no longer be at risk

440 2018-07-09 22:58:13 Oh please...
441 2018-07-09 22:58:12 And as Liberals don’t know their history they assume spreading “others” wealth around will level the economic playing field. If so then why is America THE most prosperous country ever? Likewise shouldn’t Venezuela the greatest socialist experiment ever, flush with oil, be heaven?
442 2018-07-09 22:58:07 I also completely understand that my AB NDP had no choice but to go all in for oil... The Stelmach Lesson was not lost on them.
443 2018-07-09 22:58:07 It’s officially coconut oil is liquid and not solid season
444 2018-07-09 22:57:53 Scott = Oil.  Andrew = coal OMG!
445 2018-07-09 22:57:46 ‘ I need to get some more oils for my hair. I’ll stick to my olive oil, jojoba, and sweet almond oil

447 2018-07-09 22:57:30 also, AB is not going to have soft landing when oil demand falls over the next 10-15yrs... will be a harder landing if we keep expanding oil economy. I'm a life-long Albertan, and remember the '81 crash.
448 2018-07-09 22:57:29 watching #TotalBellas yelling at the screen “BRIE I WILL PAINT YOU ANYTHING FOR FREE” hello call me i am great with oil paint @BellaTwins
449 2018-07-09 22:57:05 I am always thankful, I am also weak in oil painting.
450 2018-07-09 22:56:52 On a personal note, if 7/20 was @GasCitySpeedway, I’d be there...took that day off for reason back in December. Now im just going to change the oil in my truck and pack my cooler for Saturday since that date went to an undeserving dust bowl that nobody wanted 
451 2018-07-09 22:56:51 & that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil

454 2018-07-09 22:56:22 We in Canada are under the impression that America’s Fake fight with @JustinTrudeau may be the opening salvo in Drumpf’s drive to take Alberta. A) They already speak Texan; B) most of them want to be ‘Murican; C) they have all the oil. If they were located on a natural seaport….
455 2018-07-09 22:56:17 if you don’t have no stretch marks use cocoa butter, if you starting to get some use bio oil
456 2018-07-09 22:56:11 That’s London’s biggest diesel polluter going. Burns 700 litres per hour of 3.5% sulphur heavy fuel oil whilst moored! That’s 42000 litres of HFO being converted into toxic emissions.

459 2018-07-09 22:55:38 They're always too far. XD

Good thing is, once you've found a large ~1M copper patch, you'll be set for most of the run as you hit the copper demand ceiling pretty fast. It's the iron that keeps on demanding to be used. Then, it's oil. Then it's time to rework your entire base.
460 2018-07-09 22:55:30 Was late to my appt for PT so I didn’t get seen and right now I went to go get my car an oil change and the place was closed when it says they close at 6 
461 2018-07-09 22:55:04 It’s not her but I don’t believe we know what socialism could do because it’s always interfered with by the likes of the CIA, etc. Venezuela was doing okay years ago when they were selling their oil to the US (that’s my understanding). Then Bush quashed that.  I could be wrong.
462 2018-07-09 22:55:01 @PremiumTimesng want’s us to discuss NYSC certificate  rather than the weighty issues of remittances of oil revenue to the federation account! Stop giving that mushroom media outfit relevance. Let them report the matter to CCB to do d relevant investigations & we await d outcome.
463 2018-07-09 22:54:52 Tomorrow, is 7/10 and its oil day, get 25% off all oil and oil accessories!!!
464 2018-07-09 22:54:45 Please if you're able, give yourself a wonderful treat. Buy some good bread and slice it to make toast. Get some curated ham. A good tomato. Slice the tomato a bit thin. Put that ham on the toast, then the tomato on top, then drizzle a bit of olive oil on top of it all.
465 2018-07-09 22:54:40 You can get Duck Oil in 4ltr cans but like you not with WD40
466 2018-07-09 22:54:39 Not much!  Salad for lunch tomorrow. Some frozen vegetables. I'm probably going to make tuna or chickpea salad with olive oil.

471 2018-07-09 22:53:44 How in the world will he blame anyone if this trade war morphs into China crude import tariffs and China sticks with Iran oil. So far the latter looking solid and the week is young.
472 2018-07-09 22:53:20 Trump “the snake oil salesman deceiving ignorant votes” reality;  the Marshall Plan and NATO, the best investment and boost (tax subsidize) to industry and job, in the United States ever!!

474 2018-07-09 22:53:01 I’m sorry love! Listen to some guided meditation and lay down, with headphones on and just really listen to it. That always helps me, also weed! Weed helps me so much, if you don’t like that you should look up the benefits of CBD oil, that helps to if you don’t like the high !
475 2018-07-09 22:53:00 Your mind is too busy and active so it doesn’t want to sleep. Have you tried using lavender oil? It worked wonders for me when my minds too busy and won’t let me sleep. A little bit dabbed behind the ears .... and an off to lala land 
476 2018-07-09 22:52:58 I’m getting my oil changed at Honda and im scared they’re gonna try and scam my gay ass into paying for something else that’s mysteriously “broken”
477 2018-07-09 22:52:32 I found that wrapping my car key in foil is the best way to cook it.  keeps the olive oil in and keeps the key tasting moist and delicious.

480 2018-07-09 22:52:27 Also the food problem is VASTLY exacerbated by the state controlling food production - it basically doesn't produce anything anymore.

So yes socialism is for the most part the source of their woes.

Saudi Arabia isn't having food riots, after all, and they are an oil nation too.

484 2018-07-09 22:51:33 The US has huge oil reserves. You also have shitty politicians who let the oil companies pilfer the resources without paying back into the shared coffers. Norway taxes oil profits heavily because they profit from OUR shared resources.
485 2018-07-09 22:51:28 おはようございます(^^)/
486 2018-07-09 22:51:28 I took the bus across Western Canada a bunch of times when I was too broke to pay for the train or fly, too young (and too broke) to rent a car. With me were workers heading to the oil sands, mourners heading to funerals, and so so many vulnerable young people.
487 2018-07-09 22:51:27 I wanna try oil pulling. I've heard positive things about it.
488 2018-07-09 22:51:03 Y’all I feel so bad for coming to get my oil changed 30 mins before they close omg......
489 2018-07-09 22:51:03 It feels like the market has already muted him. The setback in Libya is immense and we have zero clue of when the oil crescent region in the east will be back in business given all of the setbacks on account of conflict.
490 2018-07-09 22:50:59 he looks like a dirty trucker who gets motor oil in his mouth and just says oh well
491 2018-07-09 22:50:53 Airlines’ profit margins facing pressure from rising fuel costs. Only so much can be passed on to consumers and many airlines decreased hedging programs during the oil price collapse.
492 2018-07-09 22:50:48 Look at oil and gas FDI data - way down now compared to 14-15.  And yes, Kearl and FH were big.
493 2018-07-09 22:50:47 It wasn't the fall of the price of oil that caused Venezuela's core problem (though it isn't helping). The problem comes from State ownership of the oil fields and equipment, which has largely become worthless, with much of it not working anymore.
494 2018-07-09 22:50:46 I'm more programmer and can do 3d and Photoshop but I can't oil paint, draw photorealistic, create even basic graphics that pop,  don't get me started on writing, who ever wrote this never actually tried to do any of those and assess then critically
495 2018-07-09 22:50:30 Ever craved sweets so bad you just like sit in your pantry smelling coconut oil

500 2018-07-09 22:50:01 Okay so I was taking hair infinity pills, that got my hair growing and I use wild hair growth oil and coconut oil (let it sit for awhile) and when I style my hair I use shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie (best shit ever)lol I want to try etae products tho
501 2018-07-09 22:49:58 Rich man's 3 in 1. Still oil (silicon).
502 2018-07-09 22:49:56 I went in for an oil change right after this hike we did today because I’m so desperate to be able to sleep in tomorrow lol
503 2018-07-09 22:49:49 No, we don't need MORE pipelines at a time when the world needs to be transitioning away from oil. Government should be leading the way, not promoting last-century technology.
504 2018-07-09 22:49:43 Oh yeah, gotta splurge and mix it with oil.  Really brings out that Nitra-Gard taste!

While Steve #Nison was the 1st westerner to translate #Japanese #Candlestick system to English and has had a great contribution to the trading community, he didn't go further to explore the hidden natures of candles in general and the Doji in particular.
506 2018-07-09 22:49:33 yeah, well and what do we do about it?

you can't proclaim the end of oil for 2027 without any plan to put it into practise, sorry.
507 2018-07-09 22:49:29 The Canadian government should just buy Greyhound.

That's a pipe dream, I know. Trudeau would rather pay public funds to transport crude oil than people.
508 2018-07-09 22:49:21 He bottomed out & sump plug came off spraying oil on his rear tyre... I don’t agree with your statement that he shouldn’t have been racing. He hung up his leathers when he wasn’t in a good place to race, he clearly was enjoying this race considering he was pushing so hard
509 2018-07-09 22:49:08 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
510 2018-07-09 22:49:08 Oh interesting! Like geothermal heat pumps? New York is trying to get more of them installed as an alternative to fossil-fired heating (oil furnace, gas, etc.).

514 2018-07-09 22:48:45 Aye really! Tell me of one other natural resource that 60% of it has to be given away free of charge to the #EU so we can then trade with #EU? Whisky??? Oil?? Or maybe gas?? No u can’t but yet u think that’s ok with fish!!! Shame on u!!

519 2018-07-09 22:47:59 If you're going to blame her for the consequences of decrease in oil price, gotta credit her for benefits of increase. Can't have it both ways unless you want to appear ignorant, which I'm sure you aren't.
520 2018-07-09 22:47:31 Have you tried CBD oil?
521 2018-07-09 22:47:21 ......I just have to top up on my snake oil supplies first.
522 2018-07-09 22:47:08 Hey @realDonaldTrump ! what do you think of this increase in the price of oil? is this a good thing for the US economy?

524 2018-07-09 22:46:32 It’s kinda like a powder you spray in your hair to absorb the oil.
525 2018-07-09 22:46:25 Nice oil install we completed recently in a large farmhouse outside Cirencester.  If you live off the gas grid we can help with all your servicing, repair and install needs.
526 2018-07-09 22:46:19 You’ve never set aside politics and certainly not on this issue. The majority of Utahns want Bears Ears and Escalante NM but you only listen to oil execs and people with money.
527 2018-07-09 22:46:17 They are.  Russian oil output efficiency is improving.  Imagine if sanctions are lifted?
528 2018-07-09 22:46:07 Oil producing nation uses oil revenues to fund welfare programs. The oil producing infrastructure - along with most of the economy - is still privately owned. When oil prices fall, Nation decided to sell its debt to bond holders, slash food imports, and to honor all debts. 1/2

557 2018-07-09 22:39:48 My wife has that problem too. 

Steak is easy.
Whole Roasted Chicken.
Slow Cooked / Braised Shortribs.

Anything slow-cooked is dummy proof, you REALLY have to try to cock that up.

For veggies- Salt, Pepper, Olive Oil and a 400deg oven until tender.

568 2018-07-09 22:37:51 Oh and my mom gave me lavender oil to calm me down (bc the smell) in the hope of sleep improvement. But that shit makes my eyes tear up
569 2018-07-09 22:37:49 I use the clean and clear spot treatment, a charcoal face wash (idc I get a different one every time), then I use vitamin e oil and these weird serums my mom got me lmao also black soap in the morning and mb lilac spray at night before bed
570 2018-07-09 22:37:48 Is the Arizona still leaking oil? I have pics of the oil slick from 86  that sun will give your a burn like no other  Niko on the lily white arms !
571 2018-07-09 22:37:47 I got an essential oil diffuser and let’s just say my life has changed for the better.
572 2018-07-09 22:37:30 Instead of burning the midnight oil, I am trying to figure out if it’s saturated or unsaturated.
573 2018-07-09 22:37:28 The ideal coconut oil jar should have a tap at the bottom for when it gets warm outside
574 2018-07-09 22:37:08 Don’t know but you seem like an ordinary joe public who knows awful lot about F1 which is quite hilarious as you can’t balance normal rational. Still no reply about Singapore I see. But I won’t hold my breath as obviously that was Mercs fault about the oil.

585 2018-07-09 22:35:52 For natural hair:
1/2 Sliced Avocado
1/4 Cup Mayonnaise
2 Tbsp Coconut Oil
1 Tbsp Honey
whisk ingredients together until well-blended. Apply the mask throughout damp hair. let the mask sit for 30 min. Wash out  with shampoo and conditioner. For best results apply once every week.
586 2018-07-09 22:35:34 I disagree with a flooding of the market with cannabis. A year later when edibles and beverages are legal, the problem will disappear. Does anyone realize how much cannabis is required to make oil and concentrate. With exports and imports non issue for me.

589 2018-07-09 22:35:24 Interesting.  I had not thought about the oil crisis effect.  Would have to look at how much of increased productivity went to pay for higher energy costs.

You may have a good point.
590 2018-07-09 22:35:21 Being an adult is getting your oil changed and eating an entire pizza and feeling it
591 2018-07-09 22:35:11 Aye Boy You Needa Slow Down On That Oil Boy
592 2018-07-09 22:34:59 It’s really hard to believe in 2018 the oil cartel is still jerking our chain. It’s been almost a century of violence, death, pollution, wars. Have you noticed every time we make progress away from oil another weird election happens and bingo - Big Oil in the driver’s seat.
593 2018-07-09 22:34:50 Opening a brunch spot and the eggs Benedict gone be called Trap Money Benny and have a drizzle of truffle oil.
594 2018-07-09 22:34:34 I really iffy with feet, always have baby oil or Sumn with me cause i don't wah none my friends round me with dry foot
595 2018-07-09 22:34:24 The activity ties to my father's shop with a McCain, Espy, Lott, Yass, Taleb, Jim Cramer, AEI, Michael Marcus, Niederhoffer, and Doyne Famer reference. Mostly pit traders with oil and gas references which also tied to the Delta.
596 2018-07-09 22:34:12 HAVE YOU EVER REHEATED A PIECE OF PEPPERONI STONERS PIZZA?!?! Because if you don't pat that shit you may quite literally DROWN in oil.
597 2018-07-09 22:34:08 tell them Big bros
598 2018-07-09 22:33:49 The politics are complex and many people still do not understand the significance of the oil find and its consequences.
599 2018-07-09 22:33:40 Or the ladies to put the moves on who need oil!!
600 2018-07-09 22:33:32 Too much essential oil tonight hm
601 2018-07-09 22:33:00 I wanted blonde hair and my friend told me to put lemon juice in it and sit in the sun. My Mom is anti-domestic so we didn't have lemon juice (what's that?). I found Hawe's lemon oil for furniture and poured a bottle of that on my head. Mistake. Even Breck didn't work.
602 2018-07-09 22:32:56 Hummus + df crackers/bread or veggies (love it w/snack pack olives), plain potato chips, granola, bread + olive oil, nuts (almonds), guac — I have a lot of vg party-related snacks. @frommybowl has a great 7 layer dip + buffalo “chicken” dip!
603 2018-07-09 22:32:53 Although UBC is happy with James, the one I'm really paying attention to is Colton Kehler. Just scored 32 goals for the Edmonton Oil Kings and appears to be getting close to a done deal with UBC.
604 2018-07-09 22:32:46 Greyhound isn't an oil company though :-)  They are the ones having to pay for the excessively marked up fuel costs.
605 2018-07-09 22:32:42 For curly hair:
1 Egg
2 Tbsp Mayonnaise
1 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 Tbsp Honey
whisk ingredients together until well-blended. Apply the mask throughout damp hair. let the mask sit for 30 minutes. Wash out the mask with shampoo and conditioner. For best results, apply the mask once weekly
606 2018-07-09 22:32:19 Rocking the plants for dinner: carrot-golden beet slaw with pecans, almonds, prunes (& a heaping tablespoon of mayo); potato-green bean salad with scallions, capers, & pickled peppers dressed in olive oil, red wine vinegar & mustard; some cucumber spears on the side.
607 2018-07-09 22:32:19 I’m gonna have to blag the strawberry dressing, I’m thinking stew them, and add to oil and vinegar with a little grain mustard and sugar - what you recon would you do similar? Never made one before but it lifted whole thing. Xx
608 2018-07-09 22:32:08 Get it? Because oil makes things slick but it can also mean that he is "sick" in the best way possible
609 2018-07-09 22:32:03 $WTI $USOIL The president of #OPEC on Monday defended the oil producer group against U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent demands for higher oil output, saying OPEC does not shoulder the blame.
610 2018-07-09 22:31:56 Fun fact fish oil is actually NOT really that good for you
611 2018-07-09 22:31:12 For damaged hair:

612 2018-07-09 22:31:08 I’m expecting a bottle of your homegrown olive oil for Christmas now
613 2018-07-09 22:31:05 The government of Bahamas has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Scott Wolf in a jute wig.
614 2018-07-09 22:30:37 33:9 And it was so, that all the men of Nineve shall rise out of heaven and earth, and it was taken with a perfect heart, and the hands of the LORD; and six hundred small cattle and for oil, and honey, to kill him.
615 2018-07-09 22:30:36 Also had a really nice birthday lunch with my nanny and papa. Changed my oil and tires with my papa and listened to his insane stories of his younger self. Now about to leave to go to a dinner being thrown for me!

618 2018-07-09 22:30:24 Reason for this warning is Saudi knows the truth about state of their oil industry The reason the @Saudi_Aramco IPO was killed is the same reason why the Federal Reserve will never be audited.

622 2018-07-09 22:29:43 Typical socialist, blaming everything else on what Socialism caused. Democracy didn’t fail them, Socialist leaders did... Ask them how the food and water is in Venezuela now after the socialists took over their oil. Socialism = Bad.
623 2018-07-09 22:29:40 Does anyone actually know the difference between an engine and a motor? If it’s a Diesel/ gas engine, it wouldn’t need motor oil... it would need engine oil. Internal combustion engine. Electric motor.
624 2018-07-09 22:29:35 You can watch me get my oil changed for $100 and get a haircut for $20 and then we can see what happens with the rest
625 2018-07-09 22:29:30 Also is that Mussolini flavoured olive oil???
626 2018-07-09 22:29:19 The failing Jedi Times Fake News story today about droid feeding must be called out. The Empire strongly supports droid feeding but we don’t believe droids should be denied access to oil. Many droids need this option because of humidity and poverty.

636 2018-07-09 22:27:47 Palm oil? Forget it.
637 2018-07-09 22:27:42 The best Omega-3 is parent 18 Carbon Chain ALA from plants. Alpha Lipoic Acid! Not fish oil. Fish oil capsules oxidize (spoil/rancid) very fast and can actually place you at a higher risk for Strokes and Heart Attacks!

640 2018-07-09 22:27:33 The oceans are finite. The legacy of ocean human activity is exploitation through over-fishing, increasing traffic (noise/ship-strike), oil/gas/mineral extraction, pollution, etc causing accelerating extinction rates, and collapsed/fragile ecosystems.

646 2018-07-09 22:25:55 @realDonaldTrump 1.5 trillion gallons is the total yearly world usage of oil worldwide. 1.1 trillion gallons is a cubic mile. Compared to all the forest fires now burning, oil is a minor pollutant.
647 2018-07-09 22:25:48 Scheduled my oil change at the end of the day so I don’t feel like I’m waiting forever
648 2018-07-09 22:25:36 You need to use thc also in healing. I vape high thc oil. Cured my crowns, ibs, type II diabetes and my ptsd with anxiety. People don't need to be afraid of thc.

Cant even produce enough oil to cover internal demand. Cant produce food. Cant provide water or power services.
All those companies have been run by the goverment for YEARS.

654 2018-07-09 22:24:37 Why would you build a coal plant in the desert with nearby abundant natural gas and oil? They're probably have to build massive buildings or tanks to house the coal!
655 2018-07-09 22:24:29 put some peppermint oil on her and it should keep them away 
656 2018-07-09 22:24:20 I say if you have legit complaints you have info to back up, be the wheel that get's the oil. If there's some stuff going down, that's what wrongful termination and unsafe/hostile working environment suits are for. Longer you stay silent hoping for better, longer it goes on.

658 2018-07-09 22:24:07 Hope it works for ya. Might try a higher mg than you used previously since it didn’t help. I agree with others that you might need the THC for pain relief though. I give my grandpa who has Parkinson’s disease 2500mg CBD oil and it has really helped him.
659 2018-07-09 22:24:00 They are protecting oil fields for 100 years and making you guys rich ... earning peanuts and then dying
660 2018-07-09 22:23:39 Reality is that no change will come as long as big oil makes profits. People are lazy, innovation only happens when there is necessity or money to be made so let’s force the situation. Write your MP and demand action. Two decades of “cant change overnight is too long”

673 2018-07-09 22:21:17 Who says that doesn’t happen now? In fact that is exactly how your representatives decide their votes. The donors - NRA, Big Pharma, Oil Companies, Wall Street all stand there handing big cheques to your congressmen and tell them how to vote. It literally happens all the time!
674 2018-07-09 22:21:16 Right now I'm deciding if I want to be the squeaky wheel that gets the oil. Or gets replaced. 
675 2018-07-09 22:21:03 Oil, mustard seeds, hing, chopped green chillies, water, a tbsp of sugar, salt, citric acid.
About 150ml syrup for each batch of 250g gram flour.
676 2018-07-09 22:21:00 Hot tip: don't leave fish oil capsules in your hot car unless you're into rancid fish smells 
677 2018-07-09 22:20:56 Women should know how to change tires and check their oil; men should know how to cook and do laundry. What world y’all living in.
678 2018-07-09 22:20:41 You have to ask yourself why they would go public? Is it because they know the oil is running out and this is their way to cash out before that happens?
679 2018-07-09 22:20:41 A lady came in today and ordered a small personal pizza with no cheese, olive oil, and artichoke hearts. I’m gonna think about that forever.
680 2018-07-09 22:20:24 I do remember that now that you say that. Mark told me, but, when I saw you tweeting out information I laughed. I was wondering if you were on Plexus or Herbalife, or Essential Oil’s.  LOL

700 2018-07-09 22:17:32 Laneige Water Sleeping Mask. I add retinol and C as my serums and whatever eye cream feels good. I would not go for coconut oil as it breaks a lot of people out and if you check out that subreddit that other cleanser someone mentioned is often not recommended. (2/2)
701 2018-07-09 22:17:27 Oil based sun tan lotions are not allowed in pool.
702 2018-07-09 22:17:24 I cut sugar from coffee by replacing it with butter. It works. A huge glob of butter and some coconut oil to boot. It's the fuel of the gods.

707 2018-07-09 22:16:58 See, what you're essentially saying is that it's OK to have a moral compulsion not to serve gay people, but it's not OK to have a moral compulsion not to serve liars. The issue is, not everyone thinks being gay is a sin, but lying is a sin universally. Who's right?

714 2018-07-09 22:15:56 Just like we enforce legislation on big oil and chemical spills into the ecosystem; there's a clear path that leads back to the manufacture.

724 2018-07-09 22:14:53 Venezuela's economy was built on oil exports which dropped in value 50% in 3 years going from 110 dollars to 51 dollars this accounts for why the country is struggling financially also Venezia is a capitalist country the private sector owns over half of the labor
725 2018-07-09 22:14:50 why is it that as an adult I can't colour anymore? maybe I just really fucking like filling in pre drawn prints with oil pastels Linda let me fucking sit with my fucking doraemon couring books leave me alone

727 2018-07-09 22:14:48 Obama was perfectly satisfied with a mediocre economy.  He tried to take credit for the oil shale boom and had nothing to do with it.  To the contrary, if anything the boom occurred despite of him and his regulations and other efforts.  He even wanted to raise taxes on oil.
728 2018-07-09 22:14:47 What are you looking to adjust? I recommend two step cleansing and it’s helped me so much up here. The Face Shop Light Cleansing Oil and Kate Somerville ExfoliKate wash. Caudalíe moisturizing essence, toner, and night oil is great. It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream. (1/2)
729 2018-07-09 22:14:33 but also in 6th grade my mom brought home an appetite suppressant spray that was basically just alcohol & grapefruit oil. You were supposed to spray it on your tongue when you were hungry. All it did was give me an appreciation for bitter citrusy cocktails.

737 2018-07-09 22:12:32 Libya, Venezuela, Nigeria, Syncrude, Kazakhstan = considerably more supply outage than even full ~1Mbd eventual impact from Iran. Iran is big, but NOT the whole reason for rise in oil IMHO.

757 2018-07-09 22:10:01 I haven’t tried the krill oil. But I agree. I might have tried to do too much too soon. Thanks for the advice.

760 2018-07-09 22:08:46 Carter was elected in 1976. The 1973 gas crisis was OPEC weaponizing oil in response to US support for Israel in the Yom Kippur war during the Ford Administration. The second crisis was in 1979 following the Iranian Revolution.

768 2018-07-09 22:08:23 Tribal cries are valid. Somalis and NASA followers are also paying for the SGR debt boss. Turkanas justifiably blocked armoured personnel carriers escorting THEIR OIL. Why should SGR jobs only be for Jubilee sycophants' kids?
769 2018-07-09 22:08:11 Addi's little sore on her back is continuing to heal. We get to treat it with the CBD Oil when she's over here at her dad's so it's taking longer than it would if there wasn't a laps.
770 2018-07-09 22:07:54 Spider bite update...all is great.  

Attacked this medically (antibiotics), organically (oregano and silver gel), and spiritually.  I think the latter (special anointing oil) is what had brought almost 100% healing in such a short time.

775 2018-07-09 22:07:23 It happens because of having an oily skin and sweating a lot.

783 2018-07-09 22:05:49 The world cannot consume all of its oil, gas, and coal reserves without catastrophic climate consequences. To limit the increase in global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius more than two-thirds of known reserves, must remain in the ground.

806 2018-07-09 22:02:52 100,000 Ltrs of oil & water from a pipeline is very small compared to a semi trailer truck which carries that much alone or a train wreck carrying millions of Ltrs pure oil. Perhaps CBC could make some comparisons to put it in prospective. How much does 1 train tanker car carry?

For example it was .5c higher 1000yrs ago, 1c higher 2000 yrs ago and 3c higher 3300 yrs ago. 800 to 1200 yrs ago the Anasazi Indians thrived in a wetter warmer USA SW desert building a civ of 100sk
811 2018-07-09 22:01:54 That damn oil change cut into my sleep schedule
812 2018-07-09 22:01:54 Bette, and when it is colder are you looking out for glaciers? Alaska has oil so way before mansions it was warmer up there. :-)
813 2018-07-09 22:01:54 Magnolia  damn let’s get some cooking oil on ya girl
814 2018-07-09 22:01:53 Yes but get RAW African black soap. Not black soap that’s actually black in color. Like shea moisture. And make sure you keep your face lotions, or whatever you use (I use coconut oil) because the soap does dry your face out fast
815 2018-07-09 22:01:49 Cinnamon essential oils are very strong and can really hurt you if you have sensitive skin and/or an allergy. Cinnamon is such a warm/strong oil it can even irritate nonsensitive skin. Please do a patch test first and use the bare minimum to achieve scent

-MOISTURIZE SO WELL YOUR SKIN STOPS OVERPRODUCING OIL.
-DRINK WATER WHEN YOU WAKE UP AND AGAIN BEFORE BED.
-CHARCOAL BAD.
-SOME PORES HAVE SEBUM IN THEM THAT WON’T GO AWAY. LEAVE IT, IT’S SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.

824 2018-07-09 22:00:42 I ordered a waterproof case for my action cam. The amount of oil I got on myself today really made me realise I'm going to need to protect the camera.
825 2018-07-09 22:00:36 Carbon tax? A good portion of oil companies would barely pay any taxes if they didn’t pay a carbon tax.  

More like a lack of diversification of employment. The AB government squandered massive windfalls they should have made.
826 2018-07-09 22:00:34 So you meet with a mayor but won't hold a town hall.  I guess you don't need to talk to constituents because you get enough money from the pharmaceutical companies, the NRA, and oil and gas concerns.  Let's face it, they are who you represent in Congress.

834 2018-07-09 21:59:51 Finland's chance to invade us for our oil. And reindeer fodder.
835 2018-07-09 21:59:51 I went to CVS to buy tanning oil and to get money out of my card. Idk where but I left the fucking bottle somewhere and im at the beach crying lmao.
836 2018-07-09 21:59:29 The chris pratt voice actor in the hurassic world game sounds like a guy im white suit trying to buy the rights to my cool hang out spot to mine the oil
837 2018-07-09 21:59:23 The gop will never stop doing what big oil big coal or whatever any super rich persons wants.cause there such greed heads.
838 2018-07-09 21:59:21 When PV and wind (and power 2 gas) outcompete the cost of fossil fuels this problem will adjust itself. Oil is as dead as diesel in a couple of decades.
839 2018-07-09 21:59:06 i’m getting a oil change and I have like 2 free ones cus the dealer or whatever and the guy was about to charge and I had to tell him I had prepaid ones and he says “ok you wanna do that instead?” OBVIO why would I pay when they’re pre paid already...!
840 2018-07-09 21:59:02 Testing DIY hair masks! Like pinterest ones where you mix like an egg and coconut oil together and it's supposed to be really good for your hair
841 2018-07-09 21:59:01 @MishkaForbes I just had a scrumptious salad- tomato, peach, shallot, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, basil,salt n pepper. Yum 
842 2018-07-09 21:58:54 Where’s Men at Work, and Midnight Oil? Oh, I thought you said “Aussie”..
843 2018-07-09 21:58:48 OH! almost forgot... One of the best builds we did used Hayden transmission and oil coolers with mandrel bent copper tubing that was intentionally external to the case. This was when Koolance first started and Danger Den was all the rage. LOL. I'm so old and still love it.
844 2018-07-09 21:58:46 Tengo ganas de salir y olvidarme de todo
845 2018-07-09 21:58:28 Oil change, full tank & a wash feels like I’m driving a brand new pick up truck!
846 2018-07-09 21:58:24 So many people have used him and he’s used them to get rich. He’s a carnival barker snake oil salesmen. There are always some people willing to buy the snake oil, otherwise scammers like him could never succeed.
847 2018-07-09 21:57:59 Then let us go. Please. Why does Westminster want to hang onto us? Why? Dump us now. We’re such a hindrance. 
#oil #gas #drinksindustry #AAA+ Standard + Poors top rating. The Tories own ONS said “per capita Treasury contribution perScot 26,500. PerAnglo 24,500” please let us go!
848 2018-07-09 21:57:41 Hm. It's like taking a marker away from a toddler cos they were scribbling on the walls and instead giving them oil paints.
849 2018-07-09 21:57:38 *oil rigs on fire off the coast of Scotland
850 2018-07-09 21:57:24 The trajectory of energy production leads to more energy from less material. From solar to wind to wood to coal to gas to oil to uranium. Check the facts. And nuclear is the only source to take all responsibility for all its environmental impacts and waste. Period. No argument.
851 2018-07-09 21:57:20 I know I shout like I don’t know much, but I do, give me 20 honest workers and we can damage PPP that how bad and weak they are.
852 2018-07-09 21:57:18 Overpriced by at least 20 million. But when you have oil money to burn, I guess it does not matter.
853 2018-07-09 21:56:57 And I just put the chicken into the skillet that was lightly greased with som oil so now I'm going to season it with some a south Corellian spice blend... *Doesn't notice that his husband has came in and can see him yet* So now I just give it a stir....
854 2018-07-09 21:56:56 Until he mutates???!!!!? @Soerings what else are you drinking these days besides fish oil?
855 2018-07-09 21:56:51 We need to address the bad because if we don’t then we’re ignorant to the problem. You’re the equivalent of a sailor letting his tanker leak oil into the sea and saying “well my computer says there’s no problem all that oil in the sea must be from someone else”
856 2018-07-09 21:56:45 These olive oil and rosemary or cracked black pepper Triscuuts are great!!
857 2018-07-09 21:56:38 My mania was so high for 2 days straight that I was able to shake out an entire year's worth of marketing plan for my therapy oil business.

Now it took one glance at an FB profile... It all came crashing down like avalanche.

859 2018-07-09 21:55:50 not allowed to be happy singing and dancing, it is a crime according to the regime, how stupid is that? but stealing Iranian assets and oil by the regime to spend in the proxy war in the middle east is perfectly ok.
860 2018-07-09 21:55:49 First dose of CBD oil and I already notice a difference. My head pain has drastically reduced and my anxiety is little to none. This stuff is a miracle, I can't wait to see how it continues to work in the long run.

He had nine years in office to build one pipe line to the coast and failed miserably. Unlike Harper, Trudeau will build a pipeline freeing landlocked Alberta oil
864 2018-07-09 21:55:36 well i mean everyone was busy so my manager was like ‘rebeccaaaaa.......’ also have you ever tried cleaning up a jar of olives in oil? 10/10 would NOT recommend

872 2018-07-09 21:54:38 The corporate state is infatuated with no taxes and no social programs and no infrastructure if they don't profit. Environment won't be saved because between gas and plastic big oil is happy they run the government. You're being swindled by mediocrity and profit...

893 2018-07-09 21:51:42 I see everyone complaining bout the heat, maybe if you people wasn’t applying all these body lotions and creams you wouldn’t be frying under the sun. What happens when you put cooking oil on fire ? It fries. Don’t blame the sun, blame yourself. No excuse for this outfit.
894 2018-07-09 21:51:36 Kenny wallace plz....
895 2018-07-09 21:50:52 Dude I need an oil change every two months bc of how much I drive
896 2018-07-09 21:50:31 bit like oil prices, that's why europe pays 3x the US for gas price so you can have expensive drug prices
897 2018-07-09 21:50:28 Everything start with practice! I remember my friend said acrylic paint is difficult hmm mybe they were not used to paint with it bcs it was their first time to try

917 2018-07-09 21:46:29 @tylertreadway10  Read your article (Treasure Coast July 5th) on toxic algae; did anyone consult with Kevin Costner or attorney John Houghtaling, on machines he has to clean-up spilled crude oil? Perhaps they can be “tweaked” to suck-up algae?

924 2018-07-09 21:45:30 @timseymour  just remind @DavidSeaburg  of his "no touch" on oil stocks when he talks down Twitter.
925 2018-07-09 21:45:23 It is not a fact, northerners are every where in the east, even in villages, if they are treated badly or not allowed to buy a parcel of land then how come they are still trooping in large numbers?

929 2018-07-09 21:44:35 the only time i’ll accept it is when it’s mixed with some fine olive oil and i’m dipping crusty bread into it. that’s it. 
930 2018-07-09 21:44:35 Ok, this i gonna sound weird, but it's easy and nutritious:
1. Salad mix
2. Can of tuna
3. Chili garlic in oil
4. Snack nuts (sweet and salty are best)
5. Mix all of the above in which ever ratio you want
6. Eat

Cheap, quick to shop, easy to make, tastes amazing.
931 2018-07-09 21:44:34 good news:

bad news:
now i have no one else to blame. 
932 2018-07-09 21:44:28 I got an oil change for the first time in over a year are y’all proud of me
933 2018-07-09 21:44:27 Having thick hair is a blessing and curse at the same time. This shit will SWALLOW some oil in 3 seconds
934 2018-07-09 21:44:20 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
935 2018-07-09 21:44:17 Deet (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide, also called DEET (/diːt/) or diethyltoluamide, is the most common active ingredient in insect repellents. It is a slightly yellow oil intended to be applied to the skin or to clothing and provides protection against mosquitoes) is your friend =)
936 2018-07-09 21:44:15 Plus, they point to the economic benefits and jobs of 'clean' technology, possibly, but it's speculation. The coal and oil sands jobs are real excellent paying jobs they're getting rid of.
937 2018-07-09 21:44:05 Try the Mediterranean diet. Olive oil; oily fish, full of omega 3, which is really good for brain
Whole grains and lots of fruits and vegetables
938 2018-07-09 21:44:01 No...you didnt. Because it is simply not true. The actual amount was around $60B.....and it was'nt as if the U.S. paid them money directly. We lifted sanctions on Iran, freeing up money that was actually owed to them from other countries, for oil. It was THEIR money.
939 2018-07-09 21:43:59 Where can I get a oil change
940 2018-07-09 21:43:50 But u claimed militants don't kill innocent pple and they are fighting for their resources? They do, and oil is not produced by them, many wells r miles in the sea. 
Now my biased self thinks u may not get a grant from FG since they will be advised by bankers too.
941 2018-07-09 21:43:47 It’s actually super good cut up small in salads with quinoa and oil based dressings. Basically put enough flavor on it and it’s worth the vitamin intake.

2. Read Debra Tannen’s  “That’s Not What I Meant”  you will wonder how we procreate as a species. Best fix I can offer.

971 2018-07-09 21:40:01 Let me see. He doesn’t get paid off by oil companies, attempt to dismantle what he’s head of, falsify calenders...but instead he disagrees with you.
972 2018-07-09 21:39:46 Wrong!
All that counts is Climate Change!
The middle class and those wanting to join it, demanded we tax them for carbon! For ten years Harper let this happen, and did NOTHING!
That's why Canadians elected us, the demanded carbon taxing, high gas and oil prices, and hydro rates!
973 2018-07-09 21:39:46 I'm not doing any side work anymore, and contracted to a company... it's slow industry wide. Oil companies are using the cheaper companies that pay nothing to drivers, might actually have to do something else and worried, this is all I know.
974 2018-07-09 21:39:45 I’ll give you one just buy the oil

980 2018-07-09 21:39:00 -Eyebrows-
• Coconut Oil: Apply on eyebrows every night and after 1-2 months, you will see a change!
• Onions: extract the juice and apply to eyebrows every night and after several weeks you will see a change. 
• Olive oil: same as lashes except with your eyebrows!
981 2018-07-09 21:38:59 1 year since I changed my motor oil in C-2500 HD.
I saved the environment 18 quarts of conventional oil. Using synthetics  saves environment on the front side too. I have used Amsoil since 1976, when I was handed down the Dodge Colt wagon. I also got my Independent dealership too
982 2018-07-09 21:38:56 No lady it was socialism. Largest oil reserves in the world and they are eating from trashcans and any animals slow enough to get caught.
983 2018-07-09 21:38:27 No sir he isn't a goner. u knw ur PDP failed2save when there was global oil boom selling averagely at 120dos/barrel. They squandered and looted d treasury. Here comes PMB at a time crude fell to below 30dos/barrel. Had d former govt saved, we would av been better. PMB till 2023

985 2018-07-09 21:38:08 I once got caught in torrential rain during the school run after just having a spray tan done and I was a streaky mess! I smothered myself in baby oil and waited 30 mins trying not to slip over! Then exfoliated in a warm shower and it done the trick, I was streak-free! :D #WIN

994 2018-07-09 21:37:28 Because the oil goes to eyes and that burns

999 2018-07-09 21:36:09 -Lashes- 
• Castor oil: apply it every day before bed and wash face when you get up. 
(Takes 2-3 months)
• Eyelid massage: Massage your eyelids with vasoline for 5-7 minutes.
(Takes a few months)
• Aloe Vera: Apply on lashes like mascara before bed.
(Takes several months)
1000 2018-07-09 21:36:09 Are you giving up coffee like me? Are you feeling more tired than usual?

Spread a tablespoon of coconut oil on toast, eat it straight from the spoon, or mix it into a smoothie.

Coconut oil is essentially converted straight to energy and doesn't give you a crash like caffeine.

If the fuel saved is coal, then there is an environmental but no economic benefit.
If the fuel is nuclear there is no benefit at all.

1093 2018-07-09 21:23:04 At no point did I write "no more incentives are needed", I wrote "need for incentives will disappear". We don't need oil subsidies anymore, as that need disappeared decades ago. Yet we still have them.

1107 2018-07-09 21:20:11 RC is the #OilOfTheMonth this month! RC is great for support! Apply after a workout, when you’re feeling under the weather or to clear sinuses! This oil has a fresh, woodsy aroma and is great any time of year!  @ Royek Family Chiropractic
1108 2018-07-09 21:20:11 Yar they have us lock stock.. what do u expect ? If I need salary raises for my people I need him? How do I function without sucking up?
1109 2018-07-09 21:20:10 @hickforco have you seen our health and safety map of oil & gas drilling in #Colorado?
1110 2018-07-09 21:20:09 Mi ganging and banging some angwa mu (oil rice) so when I'm done... 
1111 2018-07-09 21:19:58 More like oil kida it’s for oil let the media tell it like it is. No wonder there’s so much fake news going on.
1112 2018-07-09 21:19:47 Unfortunately, Mahrez is just after the oil 
1113 2018-07-09 21:19:25 As I know. We need answers now! Oil is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
1114 2018-07-09 21:19:17 I also recommending stir fry in peanut oil. That stuff is amazing. I'm going to DM you a recipe I adore that makes a delicious peanut butter thai thing with lots of brocoli
1115 2018-07-09 21:19:10 Sorry, your Viagra price went up. We all have been suffering and you and the @GOP did nothing to be able to negotiate drug prices. Not to mention @AlexAzar coming from big Pharma. You set this up when you nominated him. Like Coal for EPA, Oil for the Interior it goes on.
1116 2018-07-09 21:19:08 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
1117 2018-07-09 21:19:00 For me personally? The point has little to do with irrational rage about the EU mandating the size of olive oil containers, and everything to do with having control over who is coming into our country. We need a strong government to call their bluff. Trade will continue.
1118 2018-07-09 21:19:00 Any plastics engineer can tell you what happened to the trash plastic on ocean surface. It costs $ to make UV resistant plastic so trash plastic is not UV resistant. Consequently it is turned into dust by UV and oxidized to nothing.

I.e. it's another way of burning oil into CO2.
1119 2018-07-09 21:18:59 2 pigs liver deep fried, 4 sausages fried in virgin oil, 6 slices of fried maple cured bacon, 5 French toast and a gallon of beer, Jamie. Sounds delicious to me!
1120 2018-07-09 21:18:56 j use water and salt mine has never gotten infected. also piercers recommend only salt and water or tea tree oil
1121 2018-07-09 21:18:51 stuff is some other kind of potent looking oil/liquid thing and a girl is wary

1123 2018-07-09 21:18:49 I went in for massage this morn. I have oil all in my hair!!!! Oh, what a mess!!!! My hair just past bra hook, so it's NOT pretty!!!!! 
1124 2018-07-09 21:18:47 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
1125 2018-07-09 21:18:46 has anyone ever used tea tree oil on their piercings? because it’s strong asf and giving me a headache
1126 2018-07-09 21:18:41 It’s the powdered cheese in the envelope from a box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in a can. Big deal. If you’ve made KMC with margarine you have basically made it with oil.
1127 2018-07-09 21:18:36 Not sure putting warm up oil on my bump was a good idea in this weather  #ranoutofbiooil
1128 2018-07-09 21:18:22 Portland Oregon or Maine?
1129 2018-07-09 21:18:20 I am equally suspicious of the snake oil merchants. They do the pharmacy profession no favours.

1135 2018-07-09 21:17:16 “If God is with Quevedo who is against him? “ keep praying: not only the production will reach 10mmbpd, also the oil price will remain the same.
1136 2018-07-09 21:17:07 With less oil revenue, there will be less money to pay salaries for State workers, the vast majority of Libyans. The Cronies & Militias will always get their money first as they control the country and the scraps & crumbs will trickle down to the rest. #Libya
1137 2018-07-09 21:16:53 He's responsible b/c he helped sell the war to the gullible American people. He was on tv selling the war back then. I remember it very well. He knew Chalabi and Cheney wanted to go into Iraq for oil but Frum didn't say shit. Frum admitted this himself.
1138 2018-07-09 21:16:34 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

1142 2018-07-09 21:16:21 I'm reading this recipe for this tenderloin I'm about to make, and one for the directions says "Heat oil on medium high until it is rippling and hot" and idk why I'm laughing
1143 2018-07-09 21:16:16 That’s why I would do whatever it takes to keep selling oil to the world instead been stubborn and say I won’t do what the U.S. ask. Sadly the have control over many things today. @HassanRouhani should meditate more his steps.
1144 2018-07-09 21:16:15 The Republicans what to get ride of Russian sanctions so the can make money off Russian oil!
1145 2018-07-09 21:16:10 Try castor oil, hair oil, however left to bleed to death in his home.

1148 2018-07-09 21:15:57 Yes you do!! With mozzarella, buffalo tomatoes, basil, olive oil and garlic!!
1149 2018-07-09 21:15:46 I had to go to three different places in order to get an oil change today 
1150 2018-07-09 21:15:43 Oil. They are going to discuss how to get it. Then trump gets to put up hotels and other real estate. Oil and real estate.  Makes the world move.
1151 2018-07-09 21:15:42 Oil prices gained on Monday, with U.S. crude ending a choppy  session higher on expectations for a Canadian production outage lasting  until September, while global benchmark Brent gained on looming  sanctions on Iran and falling output in Libya.
1152 2018-07-09 21:15:33 Had to put avocado oil on my belt buckle today.
1153 2018-07-09 21:15:16 “It’s the squeaky wheel that gets the oil”. If it squeaks too damn much though it’s gettin fuckin replaced

1155 2018-07-09 21:15:01 Well canada has the worlds largest oil reserves, and the US has the highest defense spending so I'm going to go ahead and say that the combo of the two prob would be a fight. Also, what has trump done that ACTUALLY weakened NATO? Money laundering doesn't lower combat efficiency.
1156 2018-07-09 21:14:58 The coconut oil grow hair 
1157 2018-07-09 21:14:42 Usually use the baby oil but I fucked up yesterday and used some tanning oil from Hawaiian tropics and fell asleep
1158 2018-07-09 21:14:27 nope! never have. We have a fan heater in the main room and an oil heater in the hall and use lots of blankets and hot water bottles in the bedrooms. It mostly works except for a couple of really cold snaps.
1159 2018-07-09 21:14:25 I do have an oil for both of those!
1160 2018-07-09 21:14:23 me too ... ours is at the bedroom end of the house.  My office is set up in the living room and I'm currently sitting on the oil heater

1176 2018-07-09 21:13:03 Not poisoning our drinking water, not poisoning our air, not allowing deadly amounts of methane and oil to continuously spew out for half assed construction practices to earn a quick buck is not an over reaction your lies and deceit are more dangerous than you will ever admit
1177 2018-07-09 21:12:56 Thanks for the warning.
1178 2018-07-09 21:12:15 Got my hair done today and the hairdresser put so much oil because dryness  and now it looks so greasy like it hasn’t been washed  #fab

1185 2018-07-09 21:10:39 I had to pay extra for olive oil at a Greek restaurant last week, due to European Union rules (*actually true)
1186 2018-07-09 21:10:20 Today, while I was away from the house, my partner in life made me some beard oil and worked on the wine boxes we are refashioning into bookshelves for my new studio.

Not sure how that sounds to everyone else but those two facts sure as hell lifted my spirits.
1187 2018-07-09 21:10:08 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
1188 2018-07-09 21:09:59 Hmm. Foolish crooks say, do and justify their dirty deeds. But not this ole piece of oil field trash.
1189 2018-07-09 21:09:53 I've been trying to eat less dairy too! I'm also taking the vitamin Evening Primrose Oil, and that's seemed to help over the weekend. Fingers crossed those products work for you!
1190 2018-07-09 21:09:52 I am down to play snake oil if you need people to play snake oil

1194 2018-07-09 21:09:37 I need a new beard grooming kit for black men (nappy beards). 
I'm leaving my current routine behind. In particular, I'm very interested in new:
- conditioner
- beard oil

Ultimately I think I've reached max length, & want to focus on softness. Suggestions?
1195 2018-07-09 21:09:34 Capcom did it too without understanding, until it was explained to them. Oil Man was pitch black with red lips in the JP version of MegaMan: Powered Up, but got fixed into being blue with yellow lips.
1196 2018-07-09 21:09:28 It got to the point where I was just using soap and water LMAOOOO and then putting bio oil on after. Bc I can’t anymore.
1197 2018-07-09 21:09:19 sounds like someone got their knuckles rapped in promoting snake oil and other useless products.
1198 2018-07-09 21:09:18 Especially since Germany, a NATO country, which we defend supposedly against Russia. Germany who voted to put Russia out of G8, has made a back door deal with Russia for oil and gas. This needs to be brought to the attention of the public. Same with their Iran deals.
1199 2018-07-09 21:09:13 #bradweis Am I doing this right? I drank a bunch of CBD oil, and now I'm farting patchouli.
1200 2018-07-09 21:09:06 Why do they keep talking of 'extracting' the boys in the #ThailandCaveRescue as though they are oil?
1201 2018-07-09 21:08:50 We don't put oil on birds or sea life in order to film for advertising. We use already-captured footage of oiled wildlife that our partners, The Marine Mammal Center and International Bird Rescue, capture when saving an animal from an oil spill.
1202 2018-07-09 21:08:48 A Democrat? You mean the people secretly upholding the worldwide conspiracy of terrorism, anti-Semitism, shady banks, suspicious murders, and Saudi Arabian oil?
1203 2018-07-09 21:08:33 Nato member, Iran ally, negotiating accession to EU, black mailing the Europeans over refugee immigration, importing black market ISIS oil, military firepower......never ceases to amaze

1213 2018-07-09 21:07:38 I just want to be wealthy enough that my coconut oil is solid in the summer and liquid in the winter.
1214 2018-07-09 21:07:37 I finally ate food & was able to keep it down!!! Time to stock up on probiotics, enzymes, glutamine, fish oil... alllll the good stuff.

1216 2018-07-09 21:07:09 I am been trying to make a point to stretch as much as I can especially before work. It takes my back about two hours to get fully functional in the AM. Pep oil, yesss. I think another issue is bc I’m outside all day I have zero appetite. But I do drink a lot of fluids.
1217 2018-07-09 21:06:54 The drug companies the large telecommunication companies Big Oil and transportation companies wield more power in the world than most countries...it would seem.
1218 2018-07-09 21:06:53 Wash it as little as possible, co wash if u can, add oil/split end cream to ends and try to only use heat on hair closer to the root. Good luckkkk
1219 2018-07-09 21:06:38 My grandfather passed away today. He was the son of a Norwegian immigrant who founded his own oil/gas station business and took me to Billings Mustangs games in his Cadillac. Thanks for everything, Grandpa.

1224 2018-07-09 21:06:14 Lane had some oil but burnt up in spots, some carry down in back end and the heads were gone. Lot of higher perf balls hooked early and quit
1225 2018-07-09 21:06:11 Who supports cable or tv news?  Those that buy ads on their airtime like big oil, pharma, financial services ie. Walls Street, military, etc.  The same folks who brought us Iraq and Afghanistan and to a large degree trump.
1226 2018-07-09 21:05:41 Tell crawford to change the oil in his hair.
1227 2018-07-09 21:05:38 I had an iced coffee with CBD oil today & I keep asking myself, ARE YOU RELAXED?! HOW ABOUT NOW?! So I don’t know if it’s working.
1228 2018-07-09 21:05:37 For oil money city its great business but for anyone on a budget it is overpriced
1229 2018-07-09 21:05:32 Wish I had back every penny I spent on oil and fuel for my truck... I could buy 10 more race trucks just like it...
1230 2018-07-09 21:05:30 The environment.  Most young people care deeply about the environment.  Do some background on efforts to allow mining for uranium in the Grand Canyon, clear cutting timber in national forests.  Lifting rules against polluting streams.  Deepwater oil rigs off southeast coast.
1231 2018-07-09 21:05:21 The sh_t that you can hear in a company mans trailer of an oil operator is just something else... a reason I love what I do. And no, it cannot be said - typed - here or any other social media page. The ole preacher man come across and be . 
#oilfieldtalk
1232 2018-07-09 21:05:18 #UKOG Depending on the depth of drilling required and the type of drilling method used, a standard oil well can commonly advance from drilling to the beginning of production for an oil company within one to three months.
1233 2018-07-09 21:05:15 Another piece of evidence that oil is running out.
1234 2018-07-09 21:05:01 Very valid question and it needs to be debated that why Petrol and diesel are cheaper in countries like Bangladesh & Nepal? Why the local and central government taxation policies on oil are so high? What if these taxations are brought down by Rs. 10? Let's make it transparent.
1235 2018-07-09 21:04:54 Please explain? The current state isn't a surprise. The Government kicked out foreign oil companies so the industry was less efficient and oil production fell off a cliff. The gov decided beef prices were too high, they put a ceiling on prices so ranchers stopped producing beef..
1236 2018-07-09 21:04:46 Dude I got an oil change and my oil leaked, they stripped the pan and drain plug. I was tight.
1237 2018-07-09 21:04:37 Trying to be a good child by making potato chips and fish. Now I have hot oil all over my hand and I can't even eat the rubbish that caused this wahala. But they are eating and saying sorry oooo. 
1238 2018-07-09 21:04:35 Nah that’s waaayyyy to much. Too much oil for my skin. I have cream for it though.
1239 2018-07-09 21:04:25 Stupidity and cod liver oil

1241 2018-07-09 21:04:12 I put coconut oil on my feet before today and I been sliding out of my sandals all fucking day lmao
1242 2018-07-09 21:04:09 lol only mortals change their oil
1243 2018-07-09 21:04:05 Oil, Gas, renewable energy, water...
Independence first, then deal with the nobility / political elite /  power brokers.
Then the land owners, one step at a time.
But irrespective of anything else independence first, then we as a nation decide what we want.
1244 2018-07-09 21:03:57 My head says "get a haircut" but my heart says "just slather on a load of coconut oil and pretend there's nothing wrong" and I already know which one I'm gonna listen to
1245 2018-07-09 21:03:45 Even if the oil is $1 to a barrel it means a lot adding to our GDP,the problem of the colonialists is trying to castigate the resources of Africa they stole from us just to scare investors and monopolise the opportunity thru neocolonialism.Tell how u can rule out important of oil
1246 2018-07-09 21:03:43 Sheet pan, drizzle lightly with olive oil/salt, 350o F. 15minutes - best crunchy chips you ever had. No comparison to store bought

1249 2018-07-09 21:03:32 Well let’s rethink this. Selling oil overseas provides oil companies with profits that can be reinvested into the oil patch here and this ensures these buses will have a reliable source of fuel.
1250 2018-07-09 21:03:30 Me: I need an oil change Wednesday please
Goodyear Larry: can’t do Wednesday, can do Thursday
Me: okay that works. Last name, McClellan
Larry: oh is this Emily’s daughter? I can do Wednesday for you. 
VIP memba for oil changes go mom go Stuart
1251 2018-07-09 21:03:29 when you get yo oil changed n that shit drive so smooth afterwards >
1252 2018-07-09 21:03:28 New Labour remnants trying to support Tories appear to all be staunch members of Conservative Friends of Israel. Is this move to support Israel over UK? Is it an attempt to retain status quo of acceptance of Israel’s acquisition by force of Gaza & Syria’s oil on Golan Heights?
1253 2018-07-09 21:03:09 no double disk just yet but if you liked oil overload then you will love this.

1262 2018-07-09 21:02:07 Brace yourselves, gas is about to go up again (oil prices went up in the stock market) smh
1263 2018-07-09 21:02:03 Here's something to know. Canada spends $15 billion a year to import 759,000 barrels of oil a day from corrupt countries. Then we export our good (or "better") oil to the US at a discount that would generate an additional $15.6 billion a year if it was sold at world pricing.
1264 2018-07-09 21:01:59 Sometimes #Iqaluit feels like a big place then you have a day like today where three separate people have told me that the Coast Guard Captain and the Oil Tanker Captain don’t get along.
1265 2018-07-09 21:01:53 Over 6,000 consumer products made from oil and gas. Just because we quit burning it as fuel doesn't mean we quit using it
1266 2018-07-09 21:01:49 nsndndnfn i finished it already  i think it came out really really well though!!!! i fried up bacon in olive oil and cooked the greens in that for like 10 mins ish. then 2 fried eggs. keto breakfast 
1267 2018-07-09 21:01:49 I couldn’t even remember the names if I tried  but an assortment of bath bomb/bubble/oil goodies. So excited to use them

1276 2018-07-09 21:00:42 Sweden thrives from being the weapon selling superpower, Norway trades oil responsibly (unlike Venezuela), Germany makes the most of being in the center of biggest trade union of all the history. All democratic countries (with small deviations) that thrive under capitalism.

1280 2018-07-09 21:00:20 Me two weeks ago to a coworker: “Yeah I’ve really been trying to protect and take care of my skin lately, now that I’m getting older and all ”
Me now: *laying in the sun by the pool, applying tanning oil every 15 minutes*
1281 2018-07-09 21:00:14 I like that combination too. And i use butter ghee instead of regular oil lol. Makes so much difference! I dont understand why butter ghee is not more popular here XD
1282 2018-07-09 21:00:14 I'm still not "successful" financially as an artist, takes a lot more work than just applying for a job sometimes. I still love what I do and if I have to burn the midnight oil making my dream happen while juggling a day job I happily do that :)
1283 2018-07-09 21:00:06 July 09, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1284 2018-07-09 21:00:04 I'd invent one without palm oil in it so countless animals didn't have to face extinction, Indonesian families didn't have to be put out of their homes and we might be able to reduce some of the effects of climate change by saving what remains of the Indonesian rainforest
1285 2018-07-09 21:00:03 Yup! I throw it all together and blend for a few seconds. Also, lately - two tablespoons of coconut oil instead of one, pre-24 hour fast, keeps me fueled up. Lol, coconut oil is straight gassssss.

1287 2018-07-09 21:00:00 Make your own marinade with olive oil, lemon, fresh garlic, oregano, and salt and pepper. Let your lamb marinate for 8+ hours in the fridge before grilling. Yum!
1288 2018-07-09 20:59:43 There are no special tax breaks for oil. They simply write off business expenses just like any business can and does per our tax code. Health care is a service and absent the govt is of course subject to market forces. There are consumers and providers and hence a market
1289 2018-07-09 20:59:41 Norway government controlled by big oil companies and holds big short position. Hehe
1290 2018-07-09 20:59:35 I love it tossed with olive oil and carrots roasted hot. Also very good on bagels/cream cheese. And salmon. It’s super versatile.

1294 2018-07-09 20:58:49 Rookie sandwich-making mistake: hearing “only” instead of “hold”.  As in “Hold the mustard, hot peppers and oil, please.”  

Customized to be my worst sandwich ever.
1295 2018-07-09 20:58:31 okay I'm happy you feel blessed, but that's also really fucked up that they have puppies changing oil. #PETA4LYFE
1296 2018-07-09 20:58:22 Have you tried lavender oil? Stops the itching and ok to apply neat. A few Citronella oil drops in water makes a good preventative anti bug body spray too, worked on holiday and now I use it when gardening!#GardensHour
1297 2018-07-09 20:58:17 Why do all men stomp everywhere and always smell like oil

1299 2018-07-09 20:57:52 Idk if my concealer was messed up, it was separated (pigment and oil) when I got it and it creases on my eyelids like a MUG!
1300 2018-07-09 20:57:51 Well shucks, I guess it's not Carl Edwards then 
1301 2018-07-09 20:57:42 There is no chance of $1 beer nd little to no chance big oil will not gouge people at the pumps. Buffoons seem to be the norm in Canadas conservative movement, both the elected & those who elected them.

1305 2018-07-09 20:56:45 Go right ahead, stand in line with the oil companies and other anti-EVers, and tell the California legislature and @AirResources that no more incentives are needed. Are you part of an oil industry group?

Oh yeah, they'll pay for a visa, fly me down there, help me get settled, that's all real nice.

But your country is a totalitarian shithole for wealthy corrupt oil lords to chill where you can't drink so I will pass
1332 2018-07-09 20:52:52 Yeah, the coconut oil is a strong taste to start with hence why I have to take that extra step to throw it in the blender. It's way smoother out compared to just stirring.
1333 2018-07-09 20:52:32 I’ve been told twice within 12 months at work that I’ll start getting some bigger jobs to do. To this day with the exception of one job I’ve done nothing but basic oil changes. Pretty much over it

1342 2018-07-09 20:51:03 "And if your retirement fund has a significant position in Big Oil, get out of it." - that's a very good point.
1343 2018-07-09 20:51:00 This olive oil had very mixed reviews so I guess it’s from cold press
1344 2018-07-09 20:50:53 Apparently, food and drink have grown bigger than oil and gas (and much of the latter is services now).
1345 2018-07-09 20:50:52 @carlruiz now I’m worried that my olive oil isn’t real. I cook for my family with it constantly. How do you know?

The ingredients aren’t listed. It just says made from olives grown in Italy.

1351 2018-07-09 20:49:55 The coconut oil is a bit weird mostly because it just sits there but the butter mixes nicely, good texture and a tasty hint of salt. Probably do more of that in the future!

It would be like saying either "Amazon is going to 1000" or "Amazon is going to 4000".

1365 2018-07-09 20:48:04 Why does CBD oil taste like mouldy feet mixed with herbs though
1366 2018-07-09 20:47:47 Wellicht omdat LPG op Europese schaal een niche was en 'big oil' niet bereid dat in grote hoeveelheden te leveren voor een relatief kleine markt?
1367 2018-07-09 20:47:37 Atheism isn’t a system of belief, so your statement is about as meaningful as saying that Christianity doesn’t do oil changes. However, while religions do claim to provide a foundation for ethics, that foundation isn’t ethics but authoritarianism.

1384 2018-07-09 20:45:43 oil is here, we should get from somewhere that tries to extract/process/transport safely and with as little eco damage as possible,  we are in the middle of a transition btwn energy srcs and next one isn't completely defined, look up other transitions usually 50 yrs
1385 2018-07-09 20:45:41 They take our oil money, get drunk on it then smash up an IKEA store in Russia...
1386 2018-07-09 20:45:37 Why did I go to get my oil changed when I knew darn well I left my headphones at home?

1389 2018-07-09 20:45:08 A bot must be honest.
A bot must study the market.
A bot must know that oil is found in sedimentary rock formations.
1390 2018-07-09 20:45:06 We can start by me rubbing you down with some coconut oil as you lay out in the sun 
1391 2018-07-09 20:44:50 My dad must have a girlfriend. What straight man knows about putting Vitamin E oil in their hair without a woman telling him?

1407 2018-07-09 20:43:19 This evening seen and heard @ChrisGPackham give an excellent challenging evening at Winchester Festival. I paraphrase, but Every purchase we make has consequences for the environment. Palm oil in many goods. Check ingredient lists and reject any with palm oil. That's my action.

1414 2018-07-09 20:41:44 Medicinal patient here. I wish that we could purchase from a dispensary across state lines (fuking feds) I'd like to try a few strains that they dont grow in AZ.  CBD oil & CW CBD flower do work, but you cant buy the cheapest stuff out there, I buy from a dispensary its gtg.
1415 2018-07-09 20:41:42 This is the color your medicine cannabis oil should be. Not see through.

1422 2018-07-09 20:40:30 There are nations without people! Whether you control oil or food, you are doing the same- control nations.
1423 2018-07-09 20:40:27 Seriously!  Obummer did a great job! Of splitting the country, bringing back racism, ruining the economy, oil and gas industry.
1424 2018-07-09 20:40:25 I wish some brands wouldn’t use palm oil which stops me from purchasing their vegan sausage rolls
1425 2018-07-09 20:40:19 Current tasks at hand are getting an oil change followed by 4ish grams of weed for my bf and I when we're all met up and stuff. Also gonna have to really not drive anywhere cause 1/16th of a tank of gas is kinda really bad.

1428 2018-07-09 20:40:01 TV has alwys reflected social perception of its time. 90's onwards Muslims were shown in bad light. Denied participation in economic growth in India, Muslims were forced into illegal activities (smuggling etc) for survival Discovery of oil in Gulf (& jobs) helped break this trend

1441 2018-07-09 20:37:34 They DID go somewhere else. And Sanders didn't "just leave" she posted about the event on Social Media, creating a circus.

The bottom line is still the same - if you can refuse service to people for "deeply-held moral reasons," then you can refuse service to anyone.

1451 2018-07-09 20:36:30 Im Lebanese. I am from a region that has been fucked and destroyed by American interventionism.

1452 2018-07-09 20:36:29 What about oil bloting pads?
1453 2018-07-09 20:36:28 Since when did an oil change hit $95?

1459 2018-07-09 20:35:47 Why do you continue to behave as though you are a diplomat for this country Tiffany? You are nothing more than a snake oil salesman looking for attention while taking advantage of those less fortunate. And it is beyond obvious that you have NO shame.
1460 2018-07-09 20:35:46 This is something both sides can agree on but the problem has always been corrupt actors, like the guy you picked to lead DHHS who raised drug prices. Big pharma pays too much to allow their profits to be cut, like the infant formula guys, oil guys, etc. Profit over everything.

I'd cut programs you probably wouldn't think twice about (tax breaks for oil exploration) because I don't believe in subsidizing private enterprise.

1531 2018-07-09 20:27:22 As a nation, we certainly have our fair share of spivs. divs, con men, snake oil salesmen, charlatans, cads and mountebanks.
1532 2018-07-09 20:27:17 I prefer my hummus with no tahini, and with lots and lots of garlic... And when I get really fancy, I'll peel the chickpeas before blending them... Doesn't hurt to have some proper olive oil, zhug or harif to mix in...
1533 2018-07-09 20:27:14 I asked about concerns of foreign players on Cdn market access/regulatory environment, says canada has gotten better. UAE has been investing here long before the oil downturn and didn't see a reason to leave when others did.
1534 2018-07-09 20:27:13 He did make huge contributions. Oil collapsed and so did Venezuela's economy.  

I'm not saying he was great...  far from it.  He was BETTER than other presidents though.
1535 2018-07-09 20:27:03 I just spent $32 on shampoo, conditioner, and argon oil and STILL need some leave in and moisturizer.
1536 2018-07-09 20:27:00 I got a new brow dip by @KATVONDbeauty and I opened it and it was hard ): I tried putting coconut oil to soften it and it works somewhat
1537 2018-07-09 20:26:46 My boyfriend said Grace looks like The Stig of The Dump which is I suppose accurate, but very cruel. My boyfriend is worse than an oil spill. #loveisland #grace
1538 2018-07-09 20:26:33 Russia may be a RIVAL but hasn't ever been our enemy 
EVER 
and the only thing Russia threatens is oil companies profits
1539 2018-07-09 20:26:33 誰の影響やねん
1540 2018-07-09 20:26:32 Chei you are not to be trusted  but then, coconut oil is part of the ingredients so the taste would actually change.
1541 2018-07-09 20:26:29 But  when there is a little crises who are the soft targets ? Do your calculations.
1542 2018-07-09 20:26:26 You should have doused yourself in it and demanded to get on the plane. I'M BRINGING THIS OIL BACK WITH ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER RAGAZZI
1543 2018-07-09 20:26:24 @p_evans respectfully disagree with the Loonie/trade war issues. While trade is a short term hurdle, the Loonie is lagging oil here, and there will be a catch up trade. Once cash starts being invested in Canada again, esp. in energy, the Loonie should catch up. One man's thoughts
1544 2018-07-09 20:26:05 I didn’t make wild garlic pesto this year !! Will regret missing out on the beautiful  flavours!  To make it: a bunch of wild garlic, lemon juice, bag walnuts,  and olive oil. Grate Parmesan cheese and stir through with salt and pepper to taste. Just chuck it all in the blender.
1545 2018-07-09 20:25:42 The people who change my oil literally know me because of my dog and anytime I don’t have my dog with me when I come in... they get super sad lol
1546 2018-07-09 20:25:42 Is it Bilal Erdogan? The son-in-law who bought oil from #Daesh? 

Selling the oil to #European & international markets.
1547 2018-07-09 20:25:38 Like the TEVA alot right here with Jan calls....RIG breakout finally with Oil ?  ...new base between 14.50-16 next ?
1548 2018-07-09 20:25:36 Coconut oil
1549 2018-07-09 20:25:24 I only came for the oil change. I been here way too long
1550 2018-07-09 20:25:23 So your logic is: To clean up the environment we have to pollute it. 

To save people, we have to kill them.
To tell the truth, we have to lie.

None of the profits from oil are being invested in green energy solutions.
1551 2018-07-09 20:25:18 You are an idiot. The US Treasury is not the only institution holding assets. There are banks, both private and government, which were holding Iranian assets all over the world. The primary basis for these assets were oil sales. They were originally seized in 1979 by UN action.
1552 2018-07-09 20:25:18 Listen Obama had a lot to do with that ,all the Kurdish oil was stopped even when it was in the Caribbean  ,all the ISIS oil was ignored
1553 2018-07-09 20:25:09 Oil industry is failing on its own under Chavista rule . US is one of the few countries paying cash and keeping #PDVSA afloat
1554 2018-07-09 20:25:06 Think I may be getting a conscience bc I saw a guy drop his dry cleaning in an oil patch and I couldn’t immediately jump to his assistance but I did feel bad about it.
1555 2018-07-09 20:25:00 ...Or I got it, now! You hate Trump for developing oil and gas in the US? Hiring thousands of people with high paying jobs so they can better provide for their families!!! Maybe it’s that he doesn’t take a salary from the US Treasury with the exception of 1$/year that the law...

1560 2018-07-09 20:24:35 Still 5 months left. Lets go #Iran. Increase the harassments. Throw them some half full bottle of oil and let it float to them 
1561 2018-07-09 20:24:32 #FF have forever been spineless whores to whatever current populist opinion prevails. When that fad disappears like a fart in the wind, they latch on to the next biggest bubble just before it bursts

They have no intelligence, integrity or vision. They are snak oil sales men
1562 2018-07-09 20:24:31 Of global integration are not distributed enough, which leads to a feeling of having been slighted.
THIS imho is what drove people to Trump.
.
Too bad he is a snake oil salesman.
1563 2018-07-09 20:24:25 Why didn’t they show her doing it?
1564 2018-07-09 20:24:02 Another Illinois resident here. I told everyone electing a billionaire was a bad idea. He also floated the idea of allowing oil companies in to state parks.
1565 2018-07-09 20:23:55 What does he mean by "Asian" food? He lived in Dubai growing up. They didn't eat any local food? Or they abstained from chinese because the Japanese attacked PEarl Harbor? His dad was an oil executive, and educated enough to know this. I doubt it ever happened.
1566 2018-07-09 20:23:51 All the time
1567 2018-07-09 20:23:43 @damnyankeebeard the Barbershop beard oil is amazing!! #beardedmen this is liquid gold and I highly recommend this product to anyone that has a beard!!!
1568 2018-07-09 20:23:40 Can I play Trump? I already smell like tanning oil and fetid sulfur.
1569 2018-07-09 20:23:39 The UAE has $30B+ of investment in Canada. Al Mazourei says they've been here through the oil highs and lows and plan to stick around... and now plan to increase investment.
1570 2018-07-09 20:23:28 For £20 you need a ‘smear’ on the plate and the pea shoot should be crispy from being dipped in hot 1st pressing EV rape oil ...grown in the shade of an ancient tree. I’m in the wrong job
1571 2018-07-09 20:23:18 Well done @chesterzoo for standing by their principles.
@Nestle WHY? You must be mad not to join in sustainability of palm oil to protect endangered species like the #orangutan. This makes me so sad what a bad company. I love a KitKat etc but I won't buy any more. #boycottNestle
1572 2018-07-09 20:23:16 ほんま門相手つらみある
1573 2018-07-09 20:23:15 Oil’s asset value is so high that we shouldn’t be wasting it for personal/domestic transportation

The industrial possibilities continue to grow
1574 2018-07-09 20:23:13 Ask Trump why. He’s ordered Americans to start producing oil again. Disingenuous to suggest it has anything to do with Notley. But you already knew that.
1575 2018-07-09 20:23:11 Same as he does when he goes after OPEC and oil prices. Just posturing to say he tried but really probably has stock in these corporations.
1576 2018-07-09 20:22:57 Thats because of Saudi Arabia’s money and oil! They got the power but they do not have soul!
1577 2018-07-09 20:22:31 Andrew Wilson said oil was baked into 2014 (and should not have been) this time the report would be more realistic..and being that, it's doomy & gloomy...

I didn't write it, take it up with them if you don't like it..but you can't deny it
1578 2018-07-09 20:22:24 Not to worry, you will be leaving as well & seem that your date of departure is June 2019. Getting close everyday. You will have time to plan to leave with more olive oil, carpets...  Will @AfricaSweMFA @SweMFA become clever & send a clever, real Swedish ambassador?
1579 2018-07-09 20:22:21 i had the same problem with my daith piercing. i usually just cleaned it with saline solution on a cotton swab and then i started using tea tree oil and it went away! just make sure you dilute the oil with water! i didnt but i heard you’re supposed to hahaha
1580 2018-07-09 20:22:20 Like how did I let jiffy lube talk me into a $100 oil change. Like now I gotta get gas too.
1581 2018-07-09 20:22:17 what kind of oil? Your profile beard  is a recommendation.
1582 2018-07-09 20:22:15 We are so sick and tired of hearing and seeing your LIES.  @realDonaldTrump you are a TREASONOUS PUTIN PUPPET. Nothing more than a CORRUPT SNAKE OIL SALESMAN. BENEDICT Donald. Shut up and RESIGN already. No true AMERICAN wants you as potus  RESIGN now!

1584 2018-07-09 20:21:51 If I get bitten I react badly. I use Avon Skin-so-soft oil spray. It works a treat and doesn’t have any nasties in it.

1586 2018-07-09 20:21:35 Our harbor master looked at it and we believe it's an old cable that runs to the oil bollards. We're trying to determine who is responsible for it and what can be done about it.

1590 2018-07-09 20:21:00 ultimately you gotta reduce your stress somehow though.. for the long run cause it'll affect other parts of your life and health too. always mix peppermint in another oil..it's too strong on it's own to put on your skin. and a little goes a long way
1591 2018-07-09 20:21:00 Golly gee Gomer,,Would the price of oil on the world markets be responsible
1592 2018-07-09 20:20:56 Salt crystals dried on tight lips
Musty recollections
As the fingers of the red mountain pry, a blurry new spirit
The  rise of colour coats our skin, a new oil of slide
Dissolving all salt
We stretch into time
Back and forth
Unill we forget who we are
And even
Where

1593 2018-07-09 20:20:52 They use a reusable source of palm oil for nutella. You can eat it lol
1594 2018-07-09 20:20:38 an old singer is all mechanical, so cleanse and oil should do wonders, and is should bebasic in it's build, so if you need to take it apart, descibe and draw each part you tak out, and it will be as good as new :D
1595 2018-07-09 20:20:37 I highly suggest adding frankincense to your essential oil kit!!! Google the benefits. Whether ingested or applied topically,  I put it in my face cream last night and holyyyyy. This is a game changer. 

***Make sure it’s 100% pure***

1598 2018-07-09 20:20:19 Mr. Malcolm is it on the ground of Kano's population. Just like your Bayelsa State earns 13% of the oil money on the ground that it produces oil, despite being the least populated compared to Northern States.
1599 2018-07-09 20:20:17 Coconut oil!!!
1600 2018-07-09 20:20:16 You could of posted this before @GatewayMSP weekend so we could of texted you since your number is on there. Lol jj
1601 2018-07-09 20:20:14 My Neutrogena body oil + highlighter combo could never.
1602 2018-07-09 20:20:10 Our concern is to stay on top of the changes occurring in the #oil and #gas industry.
1603 2018-07-09 20:19:56 You aren’t driving it?! 
1604 2018-07-09 20:19:53 The sally blonde ale from Alosta smells like your forehead after you lay down your baby hairs with coconut oil 
1605 2018-07-09 20:19:51 No even that would'nt be simple. Our nuclear sub facilities are in Scotland (Faslane) and 14 RAF bases in NI. 82% of all UK oil comes from Scotland!  We dont stand to gain anything at all from breaking up the union. Just too much to lose.
1606 2018-07-09 20:19:41 My body hurts so bad I took 10mg of thc & cbd + smoking mad blunts 

I also have medicated massage oil, I’m bout to be in a coma
1607 2018-07-09 20:19:41 Okay I did it I’m getting an oil change. And I’m registering car. Look at me fucking go! Also they didn’t yell at me and there are more women working here then men. Fuck yeah women!
1608 2018-07-09 20:19:33 Are you saying that your imaginary friend chose a misogynistic, con artist, flim-flam, snake oil salesman to be his "trumpet". You do realize that Sir Misogyny the Orange only has money becuase he managed to con some major banks and mobs into loaning him money, right?
1609 2018-07-09 20:19:24 Indeed. It’s a totally different and delicious definition of dirty, isn’t it? Thus the work gloves, proper scrubbing and ALWAYS clean, properly clips nails. Hmmm ... I suddenly sensed a whiff of body oil.
1610 2018-07-09 20:19:07 Peppermint oil... I'll try that.

1614 2018-07-09 20:18:34 Oil looks set for a rally into the high 70s.
1615 2018-07-09 20:18:33 Today's activities include me trying to even out my tan by laying out with sunscreen on my arms, tanning oil on my legs, and nothing on my stomach
1616 2018-07-09 20:18:26 The scent of coconut oil sends so much positive energy through me...I just wanna bathe in it!
1617 2018-07-09 20:18:26 I’d love to turn off the oil. Reality is our governments have spent far into the future & need a way to pay for it. Think the Libs bought that pipeline because they love AB? Not a chance. The golden oil goose is needed to green our economy & pay for all the “stuff” Cdns demand.
1618 2018-07-09 20:18:25 I wasn’t kidding about the rats thing or the motor oil
1619 2018-07-09 20:18:20 بتستخدم tan oilوsunblock?

1621 2018-07-09 20:17:58 I’d say the Saudi‘s will add some oil to save face with Trump But not enough to stop rising oil prices. What they and the rest of the Middle East want is $80 oil.  The Iran, Libya and Venezuela situation is a great opportunity for them.m to get $80+ oil. 
1622 2018-07-09 20:17:42 I’m beginning to wonder if the Trump Train is really a twitter account run by DJ Trump himself, or is run by one of his lackeys.  After all, he is a snake oil salesman and his “gullibles” fall for the carnival act.  Wouldn’t put anything past him.
1623 2018-07-09 20:17:31 These Oil colognes di nkga on your skin even after you bath  and the scent is starting to annoy me
1624 2018-07-09 20:17:19 Saddest moment of my life so far is still when I excitedly brought home a bottle of cod liver oil to treat my hair and lashes.. only to realise that castor oil is in fact the oil I should have purchased. #gutted #lifeofjulie

1627 2018-07-09 20:17:05 does anyone know how to use bio oil??? do you just pour a bit on your hand and rub it on your face? completely clueless, idk wtf to do with this shit, it's bare oily

1633 2018-07-09 20:16:36 Yes but twinning is to Canada’s benefit.We are decades away from new sources. We sell cheap to the US so they make money.Shouldn’t we sell directly to other markets? Better than buying oil from countries that have very low humanitarian and environmental standards don’t you think?
1634 2018-07-09 20:16:24 The environmentalist can go to hell.

“If there were a blueprint of how to approach any kind of major industrial project, especially in oil and gas, LNG Canada is one to learn from," says the Haisla Nation’s Smith.
1635 2018-07-09 20:16:22 girl no, i saw a post of a chick with a long weave that started by her ears.. the only stress is the stress she giving her scalp. but yes stress can cause hair loss, and the rest is good, but also maybe head massages and mix a bit of peppermint oil in with your hair oil
1636 2018-07-09 20:16:22 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
1637 2018-07-09 20:16:01 We've heard a similar investment thesis from many players, revitalising legacy production via low-cost dvt. Definitely has potential, but these types have a very fine balancing act to walk: vulnerabilility to oil price change, management of P&A obligations, etc.
1638 2018-07-09 20:15:59 I bake bread a few times a week and always make giant croutons for salad with the stale leftovers. Drizzle with Olive oil and rosemary and roast with as much garlic as we fancy (often a full bulb!) makes salads a bit more excited by and our kids love them
1639 2018-07-09 20:15:58 You nigga poppin like hot oil
1640 2018-07-09 20:15:56 Venezuela is in crisis for MANY reasons. Maybe it’s relying solely on oil and not creating other reliable industries, maybe it’s populism, or the rampant corruption, hyperinflation, or just overspending in the boon years... or all of the above. But it’s stupid to blame socialism
1641 2018-07-09 20:15:55 #DontForgetProper ty that you got when you were a child and saved cereal box tops for and sent those tops in to the cereal company. That one square inch of Alaska wilderness could be worth thousands, if not millions, if oil or gold was discovered on it.

I think I know which scene he wanted to talk about.  It involves oil and fire... 
1645 2018-07-09 20:14:59 Never changing the oil in my car to own the libs
1646 2018-07-09 20:14:59 Forgot about the oil boom's impact. Well, then maybe a house/ranch a couple hundred miles in any direction.
1647 2018-07-09 20:14:54 The difference is declining services for who a person was born as vs for something someone chose to represent about themselves. One you're born as, the other is a choice.
1648 2018-07-09 20:14:52 Lastly ..pipeline 80% of our oil to tidewater for export and tax the pipeline use and resource. Use proceeds to become world leader in renewable energy use and export technologies. Fifth .. Stop all imported oil or products derived from oil from coming into Canada.

1651 2018-07-09 20:13:57 Talk to me when you get into oil pulling.
1652 2018-07-09 20:13:57 Man! I put on oil and felt like a damn chicken wing!

1656 2018-07-09 20:13:46 @Toyota so I got get an oil change. Check out, leave, almost get home, car nearly blows up. You forgot to put oil in my car.
1657 2018-07-09 20:13:43 Went in for an oil change and they came out saying i need a new car
1658 2018-07-09 20:13:36 You did not use canola oil
1659 2018-07-09 20:13:34 Its @AlexBowman88
1660 2018-07-09 20:13:32 also the cheap!!! af!!! veggies!!!! 1500 mg CBD oil!!! that hoe publix could never
1661 2018-07-09 20:13:32 I wish Norwegian politicians had the same guts as the Swedes when it comes to climate issues. They talk a lot, but no action. Unless its about oil and gas.
1662 2018-07-09 20:13:32 @RdtNamu I also think its inequality for an oil rich state like bayelsa that provides for over 40% of nigerians crude should not be properly represent at the HoR while a state like Kano who more or less ands little or nothing to the economy is given 24 reps.. On what Grounds?

1664 2018-07-09 20:12:52 Make sure they use synthetic oil, that runs cleaner and does not need to be changed as often!
1665 2018-07-09 20:12:50 I’ve never even touched a juul in real life, highkey prefer my oil pen
1666 2018-07-09 20:12:49 Oil...boil.....and turmoil......
1667 2018-07-09 20:12:41 Brett looking like he gets paid 200 bucks per hour rn. He unties Kaitlyn's bikini to drip oil down her back to passage her. #bb20
1668 2018-07-09 20:12:41 Sorry buddy, but this is wrong. Trump is making the deficit worse, his tariffs are about to hurt more families than they help, and he wants oil to be $30/bbl. There goes our jobs. Trump is an idiot that doesn’t know a thing about business or politics.
1669 2018-07-09 20:12:37 Whoa! Yes. Also you could try infusing everything with basil. Olive oil, vinegar, water, ice cream, your dreams. Yes that's right, EVERYTHING.
1670 2018-07-09 20:12:34 How dare ya insult my fiance >:(
1671 2018-07-09 20:12:32 I did but I started using different oils and I realized coconut oil ain’t all that. At least for me.

1674 2018-07-09 20:12:09 Is @SecretaryZinke truly talking ducks, or is he preparing us for the worst by spinning a morality tale about a political enforcer who sold America's national treasures to foreigners & Big Oil before bailing? If so, which national treasure is left? Do we still have #Yellowstone?
1675 2018-07-09 20:11:53 You mean it ain't you?

1681 2018-07-09 20:11:21 WPP's focus is to convert existing polluting power plants that operate on Coal, Natural Gas, Oil, and Gasoline to run as clean and environmentally friendly as possible. #WPP ENERGY #ico
1682 2018-07-09 20:11:20 Thanks Lilly!! The new paints are so weird; just the same as 'normal' oil paints, but cleaning stuff in water instead of white spirit is brilliant! x 
1683 2018-07-09 20:11:19 Or he simply said those things to placate everyone 
My bet is the meeting was very friendly bc there's a Ton of money to be made from exporting Russian oil. It's no coincidence that everyone of those senators have oil interests along with the states they live in.
1684 2018-07-09 20:11:06 big oil pays really well
1685 2018-07-09 20:11:06 Omo This thing happen to me January 1st 2015 Thank God say I get GirlFriend  Way They Use Palm Oil Rub am

1688 2018-07-09 20:10:52 An oil billionaire
1689 2018-07-09 20:10:52 Weren't the Erdogans importing black mkt oil from ISIS (at a discount) and re-selling it to who knows. Turkey is a NATO member and threatening to blackmail the EU over refugee immigration.......everything is possible?
1690 2018-07-09 20:10:49 Start using evening primrose oil!! I swear by it! I was 4 cm before I even started active labor.
1691 2018-07-09 20:10:44 I also mixed olive oil & “doo grow” conditioner !
1692 2018-07-09 20:10:39 if data is the new oil then enjoy having a derrick installed in your brain
1693 2018-07-09 20:10:36 i just cant get enough of the oil
1694 2018-07-09 20:10:33 Sorry sir, i only visit the oil tank with dames
1695 2018-07-09 20:10:31 It annoys me SO MUCH that i go through great lengths to take such good care of my car and yet every single time i pick it up from getting an oil change or something there are new stains EVERYWHERE. Like come on!?
1696 2018-07-09 20:10:26 シエル君撫でたら睨まれちったよ(；｀ω´)
1697 2018-07-09 20:10:10 Unfortunately soybean oil is an allergen... but just not for a large portion of the population. I can show you a bloody baby poop diaper pic to prove it ( but I would never do that to anyone!!) I was just complaining that I have to forgo. Lol. I didn’t expect someone to reply

You’re a snake oil pedlar to the masses fed on Fake News from from Offshore Bankers Puppets.  So thank you for destroying the worst political party in history Well Done!

1701 2018-07-09 20:09:44 Ever have a day where you just don’t put on lotion or oil when you get out the shower? Yeah, that’s me today.
1702 2018-07-09 20:09:39 Cos she use coconut oil wai
1703 2018-07-09 20:09:31 Got paid more for cat sitting than I anticipated. That pays for the oil change yesterday plus gas and a little extra. Helllllll yeahhhhhh.
1704 2018-07-09 20:09:31 these auto techs overfilled my oil by THREE QUARTS and i’m lucky i didn’t die today
1705 2018-07-09 20:08:54 tech startups are just fancy oil companies dressed up in software
1706 2018-07-09 20:08:48 I just applied baby oil to slide in your DM
1707 2018-07-09 20:08:48 ですねえ……
1708 2018-07-09 20:08:45 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
1709 2018-07-09 20:08:36 @chrislhayes He sure enjoys speaking with Russians! Lindsey Graham and Alan Dershowitz with a Putin-linked billionaire who made his fortune off Russian oil. He gave Graham’s super PAC $800,000. He also gave McConnell $2.5M, Rubio $1.5M, Scott Walker $1.1M. What did Alan get?
1710 2018-07-09 20:08:17 

If Frytol no good use Sunflower oil
1711 2018-07-09 20:08:16 Oh, you gotta toast the bread really good first, and then you just slice the avocado and put olive oil on top so like, it’s not soggy? Unless you let it sit for a while
1712 2018-07-09 20:08:14 Just a warning about Tea Tree oil. If you are allergic to it as I am, even a tiny spot of it causes serious and persistent dermatitis just as bad as poison ivy. So be extremely careful with even tiny amounts of tea tree oil in your naughty bits.
1713 2018-07-09 20:07:44 Right above the highlighted area.
1714 2018-07-09 20:07:38 You need more coconut oil rubdowns.
1715 2018-07-09 20:07:35 Does @Tesla car use the oil? @elonmusk
1716 2018-07-09 20:06:42 Oh, and I took a second look, they use soybeans for all their chicken, but that’s ok! It’s a good cheap oil! And only a small portion of the population has an allergy and hopefully we will only have it for a few more months! #breastfeeding Then hopefully Chick-fil-a time!
1717 2018-07-09 20:06:37 Cut them into thick slices, bbq them with some olive oil, sprinkle some parmesan cheese over it and garnish with a touch of salt
1718 2018-07-09 20:06:27 Oil,sesame,onions,salt, chilli powder, veggie for the day. Saute them!
Add water and let it cook.

Tada. Done!
1719 2018-07-09 20:06:20 The paid for house/ranch sounds good but Midland is crazy expensive, believe it or not they make Kirby Vacuums there and they can’t find labor, the plant was put in before the oil boom. It’s owned by Warren Buffett also.
1720 2018-07-09 20:06:14 But there is ALWAYS decaf!! I gave up caffeine years ago, and so happy I did. It isn't always easy but a nice bit of peppermint, tea, essential oil gives you that rush, but no side effects

1722 2018-07-09 20:05:57 15. Try waging war with very sick soldiers.  Try waging war with very sick makers of weapons. Pollution from coal and oil increase health care costs by trillions of dollars over time and harms national security, homeland security. IMF Externalities Prices Do Not Capture All Costs
1723 2018-07-09 20:05:54 #oott Looks  like everyone is long on crude now. Well at this situation, sky is the limit for crude oil price.
1724 2018-07-09 20:05:35 What tannning lotion or oil do you use?
1725 2018-07-09 20:05:30 ugh i have to go get my oil changed and inspection done i don’t want to sit at the car dealership for an hour 
1726 2018-07-09 20:05:13 My hair just doesn’t absorb coconut oil and it makes my hair look more greasy than moisturized.
1727 2018-07-09 20:04:54 Waiting on Crain to change my oil & my phone is almost dead

1731 2018-07-09 20:04:21 Argan oil ftw!
1732 2018-07-09 20:04:01 Hit & Oil.
1733 2018-07-09 20:03:56 No. Seriously. I’m all outraged becauss there’s this hint of some olive oil and salt — which is NOWHERE in the name of the dish - and it has diluted the bare mound of cut up tomatoes in front of me
1734 2018-07-09 20:03:55 all you shea butter lovers I just finished my big ass tub of coconut oil  and wanna try shea butter; what’s a good one to try out?
1735 2018-07-09 20:03:42 And in the oil biz, you want to git while the gittin's good. Because oil might go back to $30/bbl before you know it and nobody's doing much with oil suddenly.
1736 2018-07-09 20:03:42 “There are things outside of our hand, the geopolitics as well as how much production is coming from the shale oil and Canadian sands.’’

1737 2018-07-09 20:03:30 PROBS should’ve worn sunscreen yesterday instead of coconut oil 
1738 2018-07-09 20:03:26 Precisely. And historically, oil companies have spent hundreds of millions to limit their liability, particularly the loss of jobs and industry following a spill, let alone the environmental damage to an already fragile ecosystem.
1739 2018-07-09 20:03:03 don't mind this wicked people who think we are fools we don't know what was happening at that time when oil was being sold at $100to$130 and yet nothing was added to the foreign reserved that was having $68 billions when he took over the leadership of this country.
1740 2018-07-09 20:03:01 WHY have I never thought of having marinades ready to go... Any rules for what keeps longer? I imagine a lemon and oil based marinade would stay good in the fridge much longer than say your carne asada marinade.
1741 2018-07-09 20:02:50 Some natural oil of some sort like lavender or something?
1742 2018-07-09 20:02:49 Lagay lang ng lagay sa castor oil sa pilik mata. Then, tsaka na mag pa lash perm hahahaha
1743 2018-07-09 20:02:38 CBD oil might help with the twitching. Cannabis has made life a lot easier. Mind you>
1744 2018-07-09 20:02:08 Use Tressemè products too and oil it with Afri true serum available at Clicks
1745 2018-07-09 20:02:05 To further demonstrate my point that the armed forces are the muscle for the US oil interests. It shows what our country is most invested in.
We've been in the longest peace time (relatively speaking) that the country has ever seen, yet we need to make it great again?
1746 2018-07-09 20:01:44 It's terrible that within our own country we have groups like Protect the Harvest, whose founder is Big Oil tycoon Forrest Lucas, trying to bring back man's right to kill any animal it pleases. He  Was actually in the running for Secretary of the Interior. These guys are bullies!
1747 2018-07-09 20:01:41 I think we're about the same age... Baby oil and iodine was another popular tanning product I remember the older girls using to tan with.

1750 2018-07-09 20:01:16 I have to do a load of research. Half the time I end up either buying OEM (usually old stock) or some kind of sports upgrade part just so I have some kind of guarantee it'll be good. About 80% of my cars have K&N racing oil filters as I know they aren't full of Chinese newspaper.
1751 2018-07-09 20:01:04 Does that mean I don't have to put my used motor oil down the storm drain anymore? It's a pain in the ass.
1752 2018-07-09 20:01:02 Yep, another expansion...Alaska next.  All that oil baby
1753 2018-07-09 20:00:53 snake oil sales better elsewhere?
1754 2018-07-09 20:00:52 I take care of my hair it's called oil lol
1755 2018-07-09 20:00:49 Habibi ting bring me some oil
1756 2018-07-09 20:00:37 I really need to get an oil change but it’s been long over due I don’t want them to yell at me.

And You have car wax.
There’s Carbuba in Swedish Fish.
1759 2018-07-09 20:00:07 B-b-but flaxseed oil!
1760 2018-07-09 20:00:05 Maybe not at all, but at least I’m trying to not use plastics. We need more alternatives instead only oil. But as I said, just a matter of time, maybe you will be right or maybe not.
1761 2018-07-09 19:59:39 You know you’re real bros when you rub the tanning oil in @Saiyan_god17
1762 2018-07-09 19:59:20 Mustang Oil has seen and appreciates your support!
1763 2018-07-09 19:59:18 they got roasted garlic and orange zest flavored olive oil, i’m never using bertolli again
1764 2018-07-09 19:59:12 They sold it to Crown Oil pension funds and leased it back on a 15 year lease with 5 year reviews. They can only terminate the tenancy once full planning has been granted, not just applied for. The current management are just running the track into the ground unfortunately
1765 2018-07-09 19:59:02 Give and Take Business an Open Secret between BJP and Reliance. Mukeshji is the Richest Man of India and one of the Top in the World, yet BJP Govt granting 1000Cr Public Money. What a pity of Modi Raj, Our Oil Prices going Up and Farmers Committing Suicides, Rupee deteriorating
1766 2018-07-09 19:58:39 Over an hour and counting of waiting on this oil change.. 
1767 2018-07-09 19:58:38 Yeah, I use gas camping stoves with a  griddle, charcoal oil drum and an area that may become an outside oven to warm foods up, like a pizza oven
1768 2018-07-09 19:58:34 Soo I have a badly blocked oil gland under my eyelid.. have to heat up a gel eye mask and have special eye drops.. Here’s hoping they both help to clear it up! 
1769 2018-07-09 19:58:30 I love being pretty, I get discounts, free food, free oil changes  I just want to thank my looks for helping me save money. 
1770 2018-07-09 19:58:23 Best was Benson Street 20 odd years ago, a garage and I walked in and seen a fella at the back - “want the Mail left here mate?” and he ignored me. Cheeky cunt I thought and walked up. It was a life size cut out of Schumacher advertising oil 
1771 2018-07-09 19:58:16 Delivery is good.  Oil i want.  Delivery is best
1772 2018-07-09 19:57:58 I wouldn’t use cotton, the oil on the hide might eat it up. Nylon like beading thread would be fine, but sinew or artificial sinew is the best tbh
1773 2018-07-09 19:57:52 Have they found oil in your garden?
1774 2018-07-09 19:57:51 Do you think frank would have any interest in a Kmart oil can ?
1775 2018-07-09 19:57:43 ..we live in interesting times..now China has agreed to terminate imports of US oil in favour of Iranian crude..the enemy of my enemy etc
1776 2018-07-09 19:57:41 NEW CLAN  OF BARKA'MELCHIZEDEKRIEST IS TO BE FORMULATED ALSO BY QUEEN(S) OF MELCHHZEKRIEST,(VIRGINS WITH OIL)- (F.M.I.G.O.D.D.W.G.K.O.R.D.P)
1777 2018-07-09 19:57:37 When I think of Australia I think of Mad Max movies, opera houses, Midnight Oil, the brief career of Yahoo Serious but never licorice
1778 2018-07-09 19:57:32 If anything it would be more of an argument for Iranian or Saudi Arabian Oil tycoons.
1779 2018-07-09 19:57:29 Can't are the left top corner ptherwose@I wouldn't ask
1780 2018-07-09 19:57:23 Oil is going way up and big don can fuckin suck on that
1781 2018-07-09 19:57:12 Oil is one of the most refined foods on the planet.  Increased fat consumption is why type 2 diabetes, cardiac disease, hypertension...are epidemics.  #wholefood #plantbased #lowfat
1782 2018-07-09 19:57:10 you know when spongebob and patrick were at the fry cook olympics and they spill oil onto the crowd(fish) and it turns them all into fish sticks. i want those
1783 2018-07-09 19:57:05 Naturally Trump is going to call it a hoax cuz he is not going to mess around with oil companies those are his name companies that he loves he's in the back pockets of all the big business there's no way he's going to help us we're all going to die because of him
1784 2018-07-09 19:56:58 $125 for an oil change. 
1785 2018-07-09 19:56:42 And people say the right wing has the conspiracy theorists, so this is ALL a big oil scheme? That's what you are saying. I'm gonna go ahead and say prob not. They are 8th in world reserves.....
1786 2018-07-09 19:56:36 Er, the picture immediately above my reply, taken from the commitment of traders report published today
1787 2018-07-09 19:56:10 I felt like putting a bullet between the 
eyes of every panda that wouldn't screw to save its species.

I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother all the French beaches I'd never see.

I wanted to breathe smoke.
1788 2018-07-09 19:56:03 Carvalho is a donkey, good passer but turns like an oil tanker, the WC proved that unfortunately.
1789 2018-07-09 19:55:49 Awesome. Thanks for taking a stand against the oil industry and pollution.
1790 2018-07-09 19:55:45 APPLY OILS OVERNIGHT
- castor, coconut and olive oil are common for lash growth and can strenghten them
- leave it on overnight and wash off in the morning
- you can also use vaseline
1791 2018-07-09 19:55:45 fam i came home to five new spots on my face today and as soon as i took my makeup off, i put tea tree oil on em and then a generous amount of aloe vera and THEY’RE GONE, BOOM, SPOTS WHO???? BYE SWEETIE!!! idk her!!!

1793 2018-07-09 19:55:27 Unlike Jr., Erdogan's son(s) have made a lot of moolah smuggling oil all over the place, i.e., real high finance. Jr. , not sure he can even run one of the hotels.
1794 2018-07-09 19:55:26 Just like the Saudi's are going to raise oil production and North Korea is going to denuclearize.
1795 2018-07-09 19:55:26 I am not that interested. You ramble all over the place. North sea oil? How is that related to being worse off after Brexit. Oil field nearly exhausted. The NHS story is project fear and not fact. Any government proposing this is onto a loser.
1796 2018-07-09 19:55:25 @Varneyco I bought Petroteq Energy when you interviewed the CEO on your show. I was impressed on his grasp of the technology and that oil might go up. Bought in at .78 and it's now .949 at close today. Would love a revisit with him given the latest news. Thanks Stu!
1797 2018-07-09 19:55:22 Source?
1798 2018-07-09 19:55:21 Compostable concerns me if they have plastic in them, as then you introduce micro plastic into environment. It really need to be from a plant material rather than oil based #EthicalHour ie not plastic
1799 2018-07-09 19:55:08 We do not like people who split up babies from parent or guardians, we do not like dirty water, pollution, contamination of food, drilling of our forests, spilled oil off our shores, lung cancer from the coal mines, nuclear war, being alienated from our allies.  Nope, don’t like!
1800 2018-07-09 19:55:02 Reading 100, 150$p/b and 300$p/b and I wonder, what would I do if I were CEO from a company which needs oil to work? Probably I would try to change to other energy source. Trying to scare the market today to fill your pockets will empty your pockets tomorrow. #OOTT #cleanenergy
1801 2018-07-09 19:54:50 Folks need to know the consequences of oil price shocks. Well that coupled with a weak local currency. Poor Cyril for getting all the smoke.

1803 2018-07-09 19:54:33 My wife got me some type of oil, rubbed that on each morning and it actually feels better.
1804 2018-07-09 19:54:21 One I am aware of right now is evening primrose oil!
1805 2018-07-09 19:54:07 A weak NATO is the key.  Makes it so much easier for Russia to invade Baltic countries & control those ice free shipping ports.  Easier to invade Ukraine (not Chechnya!) & get Russian oil to Europe.  Expanding Westward has always been the goal. #NATO
1806 2018-07-09 19:53:48 @jonlovett awesome statement on truffle oil!!! Can always count on you to speak the truth!
1807 2018-07-09 19:53:37 oh nice, that does look good. unrelated to the last two, im currently reading upton sinclair's "oil!" and so far it's a good one
1808 2018-07-09 19:53:30 Obviously, the only energy investments that can produce returns over the next few decades are be renewables. Oil assets will have be stranded to avoid a climate disaster that would destroy the global economy and bring all your returns to dust anyway, Because #ThisIsZeroHour
1809 2018-07-09 19:53:11 I want to give the chefs/caterers Okomu Banga Red oil on twitter.
So they can use to cook and publicise it for me.
1810 2018-07-09 19:53:09 i took a deep look into my closet and after hearing an astrology video go off on how aries moon people dress androgynous, i really do most of the time
1811 2018-07-09 19:53:05 Olive oil is good for you, according to the Greeks.
1812 2018-07-09 19:53:03 Grrr, went to a Chinese restaurant where the menu is marked gluten free. They then told me it was gluten free but they cooked everything in the same oil at the same time as non-gf food. I said but I have coeliac, they said what’s that? Unsurprisingly I ate somewhere else!
1813 2018-07-09 19:53:02 I love living in a weed friendly house, my mom told me she got CBD for her back pain and I told her thats what i’ve been trying to get for my migraines and she said that next time she gets paid she’d go and buy me CBD oil + pipe + CBD weed

1815 2018-07-09 19:52:38 The "sexual revolution" and abortion on demand made women disposable. They weren't sold worthless snake oil, they were sold poison.
1816 2018-07-09 19:52:36 i’d normally be v salty about having to wait an hour and a half for an oil change but this place has a/c so 
1817 2018-07-09 19:52:30 Cut the lawn, change the oil, satisfy their wives...ya know, the jobs immigrants take
1818 2018-07-09 19:52:16  The oil hasn't poured...because you haven't showed up. Heaven has given you the crown, it can't be given to anyone else even in your absence!
1819 2018-07-09 19:52:13 Why didn't the FBI, under Obama , investigate Bush? Why didn't the FBI under Trump investigate Obama?
Trump is, step by step, is carrying out Putin's plan. He wants to ensure the world remains on an oil economy since that is his main commodity.
1820 2018-07-09 19:52:07 For evening, to sleep, would draw a cool bath w/essential oil (& Epsom salts if joints/muscles need soothing). During the day, tho exasperating (& embarrassing) when I broke  into a sweat  talking to someone, became a useful emotional barometer: who/what are stressors.
1821 2018-07-09 19:52:06 The problem with implementing anything socialist in a third world country today is that there is no incentive for the government while in a first world country it’s a crime to be using gafts and kickbacks. There was nothing else going for Venezuela’s economy but oil,

1823 2018-07-09 19:52:05 Did he really? Boris must be on the take then. But by whom? Mullahs? or Oil Lobby?
1824 2018-07-09 19:52:04 We are always fighting the wrong battles. Ships legally and illegally dump 7 x Exxon Valdez super tankers worth of oil into our oceans every year via bilge water discharge.  I have tech that eliminates it completely but can't sell bc companies can legally dump.
1825 2018-07-09 19:52:03 Find*
1826 2018-07-09 19:51:55 Hahaha fine me Tecia's. Right now.
1827 2018-07-09 19:51:37 did u season ur chicken before it went in the pan? did u use any spices in the oil? also u should deglaze with a cooking wine just a tiny bit it's so good in stir fry
1828 2018-07-09 19:51:05 If you're referring to me, you clearly don't know what a bootlicker is. 
Going after big oil before providing an alternative is a death sentence for millions of poor people across the world. First world privilege blinds people to that reality.
1829 2018-07-09 19:50:55 my biggest issue was skipping cleansing oil and sunscreen...like omg mattie how can u let your skin suffer like this you FOOL...ill make a review thread l8r, my korean friends reccd me a LOT of products to start looking so ill send what ive bought so far!!
1830 2018-07-09 19:50:51 $BTE going to rocket after merger and is oil keeps on rising.
1831 2018-07-09 19:50:33 Current US #oil policy vis-vis #Iran is the #Trump Administration’s version of President Carter’s helicopters in the desert fiasco of 1980.

1835 2018-07-09 19:50:10 That's why I make my own lunch  that's just creepy right there.. So much oil WTF!! 
1836 2018-07-09 19:50:08 If your hairline starts halfway down the back of your head, maybe give the braids and weaves/tight styles a rest. Get some castor and rosemary oil on your scalp and start trying to wake up the follicles that have retreated.
1837 2018-07-09 19:49:54 Uh, all the shit he's put on the books ain't some xenophobic Nazi shit?
Also Saudi Arabia is where all the terrorists who have actually done shit have come from but that country's not on the list bc they got all the oil and the money. We banned Syria while we're killing them all.
1838 2018-07-09 19:49:52 socialism implemented faithfully is what ruined it. As for the oil, it was because it was pretty much the only thing they had going, it was the only big enough industry to steal money from for them to carry out their noble endeavors. But that's what I think modern socialist
1839 2018-07-09 19:49:48 ConocoPhillips is seeking to intercept potential proceeds from a lawsuit filed by a PDVSA trust in the U.S. against oil traders, as the legal battle to fulfill a $2.04b arbitration award against the Venezuelan oil company escalates.

1840 2018-07-09 19:49:33 Ask him what happens to the Aberdeen economy if supply chain to the oil and gas service sector is disrupted by being out of customs union
1841 2018-07-09 19:49:30 Don't forget he also opted out of it for himself..
1842 2018-07-09 19:49:12 I be thinking so too but my nigga loves it and coconut oil 
1843 2018-07-09 19:49:08 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
1844 2018-07-09 19:48:59 So where do I buy CBD oil?
1845 2018-07-09 19:48:57 I should never be allowed to wear white pants out in public...tea, salsa, lipgloss and what appears to be motor oil all before noon 
1846 2018-07-09 19:48:53 TRUMP REEKS OF FEAR?
You are fooled by Trump's natural aroma. Even from this vast distance, we clearly smell his AgeLESS toupee adhesive; stale Hai Karate; Axe DirtySexyMoney Body Spray; Touch of Eros Tropical Mango Tanning Oil; and a mix of beef, cheese, & grease.
1847 2018-07-09 19:48:51 Stop buying it at all..
No health benefits..
Coconut Oil is the best..
1848 2018-07-09 19:48:51 Why oil changes take so long 
1849 2018-07-09 19:48:51 Has Gartman said lately that oil will never get below $50 again in our lifetime?....no top until that occurs?
1850 2018-07-09 19:48:42 Was Getting an oil change
1851 2018-07-09 19:48:37 4 jars of oil
1852 2018-07-09 19:48:33 Living proof that MSM papers and TV propaganda really does work.and much more valuable than oil plans are underway to steal our water once they've sucked Wales dry
1853 2018-07-09 19:48:28 I read: an alternative to dollar oil.

Soros funded a few demonstrations that triggered an uprising and now post Arab Spring, Libya openly trades slaves. But that's OK because they're not challenging status quo and any outrage is toothless.
1854 2018-07-09 19:48:27 You can buy jars of roasted pepper in oil from most supermarkets. Saves the messing about..... #toptips

1864 2018-07-09 19:47:35 Having seen twitter insert of a woman in Iran arrested for dancing in on social media, what interests me here is Arabs having gotten filthy rich off of oil and the technology to well it, built Dubai cities off same western technology, then scold, terrorize the west for its ways.
1865 2018-07-09 19:47:33 Have they done an oil & filter change on a 4x4? If not,I’m not bothered.
1866 2018-07-09 19:47:31 You know you’re bffs when even the oil guy references @ashlynn_waldrip as my “partner in crime” cause we go get our oil changed together & she didn’t come with me this time
1867 2018-07-09 19:47:29 They distributed our national wealth to themselves. From oil wells, imports, subsidy, pilotage, contracts, etc all in the name of private investments. Most of them avoided tax, or pay less than what they should be paying. Now the Sherrif said no. ........
1868 2018-07-09 19:47:28 What job approval are they talking about? He isn't doing his job at all, except if they call his fleecing of america his job, in that regard he is excellent like the snake oil salesman he is.
1869 2018-07-09 19:47:25 Me too. Plain yam and oil sauce

1881 2018-07-09 19:46:37 Then you are good to go...BTW if you mix a cupof water,3 Tbsp melted coconut oil and what you are mixing up in a gallon ziplock bag filled with as many Bounty paper napkins as you can shove into it you have instant bug repellent wipes just let the water seeped through all of it

1889 2018-07-09 19:45:50 LONGEST. OIL CHANGE. EVER. Lol jk.  But yea, I agree with ya, that's why fast food is saltier than a motherfucker.
1890 2018-07-09 19:45:47 Fries may be understandable. Yet there are air friers o which use minimal oil & keep u healthy. But ice Cream? KILODE? We are free men o, not slaves. Pls reject any ‘expert’ claims that hurt ur conscience o. Ice cream is a gift from God.

1908 2018-07-09 19:44:04 The ‘militia’ in Leb that hosts Syrian refugees. Or the barbarians in KSA who spend oil money on buying little Syrian girls from those very same camps for paedophilic fantasies? Is a tough one...
1909 2018-07-09 19:43:53 Read about a guy making 78k/month in the oil patch! People were chiming in about taxes, I was thinking there is tax strategy’s but few this guy can take advantage off if the money rolling in this quick! Just interested subject. He is in oil equipment sales in Midland/Odessa.
1910 2018-07-09 19:43:44 Wait until NATO and Putin in Helsinki. He is pulling Russia out of the fire by oil prices rising so much. And, don't forget who picked up the China Soy Bean order when he blew his best supporters out of the water with tariffs. Will it ever end? He has given Syria to RU. EZK:38

1927 2018-07-09 19:41:07 Nossa, mas acho que meu caso nem é pra oil free, pelo contrário, meu rosto tá tão seco que tá até trincando rs. Vou procurar um Nívea tradicional mesmo 
1928 2018-07-09 19:41:04 I have this extreme desire to go home and paint solid geometric forms from life with oil paint to practice my brush expressions rather than relying on color to do the heavy lifting.
1929 2018-07-09 19:41:00 The main dietary cause of high blood cholesterol is too much saturated fat. Meats, whole-fat dairy products, and other animal-derived foods can be loaded with it. You should also keep an eye on intake of palm and coconut oil.
1930 2018-07-09 19:40:57 can’t get a oil change until tomorrow 
1931 2018-07-09 19:40:47 I’m buying zinc and fish oil in bulk on amazon as we speak

1934 2018-07-09 19:40:28 I would also like to buy a stock in the pipeline to slow down the sale of Canadian oil supply, I repeat Canadian.

1939 2018-07-09 19:40:00 That’s my issue with my generation of men you want a woman with a fat but cute face want her to be able to cook etc and you can’t even tell me what type of oil is in YOUR own car..
1940 2018-07-09 19:39:57 Listening to white people talk about the benefits if coconut oil. 

Lol you're late
1941 2018-07-09 19:39:57 You go to firestone just to get your oil change and they hit you with “ oh and btw all four of your tires need to be changed “ im good luv, enjoy 
1942 2018-07-09 19:39:50 So we have to refine more heavy crude to blend with our poor octane shale derived gasoline to get a decent octane. Good for heavier oil producers. Bad for shale.
1943 2018-07-09 19:39:44 Rewarded myself with KitKat for getting my oil changed. 
1944 2018-07-09 19:39:42 My coconut oil is a puddle in a jar, I haven’t worn a jumper in weeks and I’ve had to get a bank loan for supplies of suncream. Someone just turn it off already.

1947 2018-07-09 19:39:25 My bf bought this awesome toner with tea tree oil and every time I use it I think of @lskelt and how she used it to cure me in India 
1948 2018-07-09 19:39:18 This is not good, they will have harder time to unload long positions. Very bad ratio :p
1949 2018-07-09 19:39:17 Basically a concoction of sugar, refined starch and oil. Very wholesome. Your incretins will love it.
1950 2018-07-09 19:39:09 ej zaczęłam używać bio oil może coś to da
1951 2018-07-09 19:39:06 Yho... The Traditional healer these people go to, must be highly qualified... With a lot of PhDs, phela no one dies in this telenovela... They'll tell us that the maid fed Brutus Castor Oil...

1953 2018-07-09 19:39:00 What's with this "environmental thugs" shit? I do more BC media defending Alberta, oil sands, pipelines than CAPP, CEPA, EPAC put together...all gratis, of course. CKNW producer to me: "What's a CAPP?" How much time, $$ do you spend defending Alberta outside Alberta?
1954 2018-07-09 19:38:42 My whole desk stinks of teatree oil. I blame @zizzyphus.  

(But I haven't had another skeeter bite in 3 hours. Before trying the TTO, I had a dozen.)
1955 2018-07-09 19:38:37 The kind of inflation that can happen during a recession is the kind that comes from rising costs, (like a rising price of oil for instance) and it can't be fixed by raising interest rates (the only solution is to get more oil).
1956 2018-07-09 19:38:33 Grand Oil. #Productreviews
1957 2018-07-09 19:38:23 oil
1958 2018-07-09 19:38:17 Nobody has ever needed an oil change every 3000 miles. It's just a marketing scam to get the world to buy more motor oil.
1959 2018-07-09 19:38:12 I so want to be your neighbor and best friend. Thanks for all you do. You inspire me daily to keep it right...my life depends on it. Bypassed a triple bypass 4 years ago by going vegan plant based...no oil...10% fat...following Dr E’s protocol and your inspiring recipes.
1960 2018-07-09 19:38:06 got my car keys and some chapstik and an oil sheet and some cologne and some tylenol for later and some evian mist and my phone and my portable battery and 3 pairs of sunglasses and emergency glitter and a visor and some hot sauce and someone elses keys they threw at me and
1961 2018-07-09 19:38:06 Need to get this oil changed this week 
1962 2018-07-09 19:38:02 dude's a snake oil salesman that's wrapped people in some good ideas and prospects of a grand, interstellar adventure
1963 2018-07-09 19:37:51 Worth the try! Sourdough bread, Olive oil, medium low heat until cheese melts then you can ramp it up to medium high for about 30 seconds each side to get the bread crispy at the very end.
1964 2018-07-09 19:37:49 I didn’t say that at all, I’m just saying socialism implemented in that country failed, I’m just admitting I don’t know the full extent because I’m aware of the oil policy playing a role in crippling their economy
1965 2018-07-09 19:37:34 To usando um excelente da Nivea! É daqueles tradicionais, mas oil free (tampinha verde), combo com a manteiga de cacau <3 tá salvando! Vc acha os dois na farmácia mesmo :)
1966 2018-07-09 19:37:02 that's why u have explosions at Plants in GOP states and Oil trains derailing...just ask Steve King...

1968 2018-07-09 19:36:51 Hahaha I know someone who has got oil and his army
1969 2018-07-09 19:36:50 Crude oil prices settled higher Monday, but were under pressure as Canada's Syncrude operations are set to resume activity sooner than expected, while signs of rising U.S. output added to concerns
#Crude #CrudeOil #OPEC #Brent #Oil #oilandgas #Comex #Commodities #Canada #USA
1970 2018-07-09 19:36:46 I agree there. That doesn't reduce my support of Canada making money off of our oil to help fund the transition to a post oil world.
1971 2018-07-09 19:36:45 Y’all don’t even wanna know how much i just paid for an oil change lmao
1972 2018-07-09 19:36:38  with a side of extra virgin olive oil
1973 2018-07-09 19:36:37 Grand Oil = GPSO. it doesn't congeal even inside freezer
1974 2018-07-09 19:36:23 Good point. I’ve been bare-legged on holiday, but not walking much, so have been ok. When I have been walking a lot, it’s been a tiny amount of high-quality shaving oil for me to stop chafing. Works like body glide.
1975 2018-07-09 19:36:22 (And I mean the fancy kind packed in olive oil that costs ten bucks a can)
1976 2018-07-09 19:36:12 I love to feel incredibly skinny via dabbing the oil off my pizza with a napkin
1977 2018-07-09 19:36:12 Hahahahaha it’s not even addictive. Honestly as a chronic pain sufferer I honestly feel more comfortable using weed oil than some painkiller that contains God knows what. But you know I’m Dutch we are quite open to soft drugs here XD
1978 2018-07-09 19:35:50 Pretty much driven by the left. Under Obama things got worse and leftists just keep fanning the flames. Popular now for even some white ppl to hate white ppl. Antifa mostly self loathing white anarchists
1979 2018-07-09 19:35:41 Turkana have refused to smell the oil.
1980 2018-07-09 19:35:11 Stopping TMX is not reducing the worlds consumption of oil. It is merely ensuring countries with considerably more HR abuses than Canada can continue to profit while we don't make money off of our oil.  I support requiring govt to put all rev directly from oil towards renewables.
1981 2018-07-09 19:35:10 Spanish tortilla! Onions and potatoes slow cooked in olive oil before pouring egg on it uuuuuunfff
1982 2018-07-09 19:35:04 Doing my, apparently, every 5 years @ShadowTodd content marathon, and I only can say that the jokes about the Midnight Oil singer political career hasn't aged well. At all...

While his joke about not leaving the house have me in stitches for an hour
1983 2018-07-09 19:34:58 잠시만용 금방 들갈께욤
1984 2018-07-09 19:34:57 Somebody told you of best economic team between 2010-2015, the same period FX was depleted from $42B down to $28B. The same time oil sold for $100/barrel of 2.2M barrel daily yet a dime was not added to FX. The same time JAMB remitted less than N20M in 5yrs. Best economic FRAUDS?
1985 2018-07-09 19:34:51 The symbolism is amazing. The chair of Rosneft, the Russian state owned oil company, who happens to be the ex-chancellor of Germany, attends the Turkish president's inauguration as the formal representative of the German federal government. @bkalnoky
1986 2018-07-09 19:34:44 Oregano and olive oil lays? Yes please!
1987 2018-07-09 19:34:38 Definitely an oil drum situation.
1988 2018-07-09 19:34:33 CanaGel Hemp Oil Gel Melts 
1989 2018-07-09 19:34:32 A thing I learned once I started really paying attention to Texas politics: "small government" only means "small" in the sense that the status quo is vigorously maintained in favor of businesses (in Texas' case, oil) and "traditional" (white supremacist) values.
1990 2018-07-09 19:34:24 That freaking sucks because I keep hearing tea tree oil really helps with sebum.
1991 2018-07-09 19:34:23 @Chandrathan getting the pre concert oil change, an annual ritual.
1992 2018-07-09 19:34:02 Im getting my oil change and this guy comes in after me they ask my mans what type of oil he uses and he responds I don’t know.... 
1993 2018-07-09 19:33:44 Fry an egg in sesame seed oil and you'll have the choice of any 9/10 in your local area
1994 2018-07-09 19:33:34 A group of MIT materials scientists created LiquiGlide, a surface that allows anything to roll off of it like oil on a frying pan.
1995 2018-07-09 19:33:27 How long were you taking it for and what kind/Dose? Full Spectrum Hemp CBD Oil is better for inflammation than CBD Isolate! I hope you find relief in some form! 
1996 2018-07-09 19:33:25 The #KremlinCaucus were a specific, hand-picked bunch of Quislings. All from oil & gas states; all backers of home state pipeline projects that RU bots have been attacking, for some strange reason.
1997 2018-07-09 19:33:16 double bonus.

I do that with coconut oil. then my bed smell of coconuts all night ;)
1998 2018-07-09 19:32:57 Oil Price again spiralling upwards ! Domestically , petrol prices hiked for Fifth consecutive day. I feel that Oil is going to be a big pain for Modi Government ! And unfortunately in the election year.

Trump is only worsening things with Iran Sanctions ! Bhagawan bachaye hume
1999 2018-07-09 19:32:50 I put on coconut oil on my eyelashes every morning/evening. They look great now and it is worth getting the oil in my eyes every time.
2000 2018-07-09 19:32:50 Saudi Arabia is head of UN's Human Rights Council. Good luck with that.

Blame the UN, they're bought with oil money.
2001 2018-07-09 19:32:49 they in there trying to deep condition and do a hot oil treatment like gone somewhere
2002 2018-07-09 19:32:43 An aside - in an attempt to maintain this six pack, I've added MCT oil to the intermittent fasting/keto fold. Just took my first MCT oil shit:

Omfg. I'd call it a very fun, but stomach gurgling, watery, acidic shit. I took 1 tbsp, I'll take 2 tomorrow.

2007 2018-07-09 19:31:50 OK thank you. And yes body shop's tea tree oil is wonderful. I haven't tried anything else from this range yet
2008 2018-07-09 19:31:38 I would love to see a flyer from primary season with him advocating elimination of energy regulations on coal & oil.
2009 2018-07-09 19:31:28 Warm summer afternoon in New York State.  Data from @NewYorkISO shows electric grid powered at 2:20 p.m. EDT by 53% natural gas/oil, 25% nuclear, 18.5% hydro, 2% wind, and 1.3% "other" renewables.
2010 2018-07-09 19:31:23 I know fuel levy combined with RAF is R5.30, and we both know the levies increased but to compare 2008 and now without factoring in all factors is wrong and that's what I was trying to point out. Exchange rate, levies & taxes, and price of crude oil are all factors here.
2011 2018-07-09 19:31:13 Oh it was a dream. I dreamt I had cannabis oil.
2012 2018-07-09 19:30:49 I hate how people from the south pronounce “oil”
2013 2018-07-09 19:30:45 Getting oil changed/tire rotation. This place has Springer on TV. Serious question, does Jerry Springer still put out new episodes?
2014 2018-07-09 19:30:40 10 lbs, but I'm not doing it for weight loss. I actually gained weight when I was cooking everything in olive oil and adding 2 tablespoons of coconut oil to my coffee. Weightlifting and mountain biking are unbelievable now, with all the extra energy.

2019 2018-07-09 19:30:29 Information thru from @Greenpeace that PJ Cussons and brands incl Carex are knowingly still using Palm Oil to the endangerment of many species.

Will @Tesco @sainsburys @BootsUK @asda @Morrisons stop stocking their products into they stop destroying the planet 

Or condone them?

2023 2018-07-09 19:30:02 The service yesterday was "SUPER-SUPER" - Guest Minister - Pastor Peter Yakubu. #6thSuperSunday #OilOfGladness 
The last of the 7 Super Sunday Services is this Sunday 15th July. Come, and share in the oil if gladness.
2024 2018-07-09 19:29:57 Sickening to see Gove at the back of Commons winking in agreement at TM’s statement, this snake oil salesman was a supposed leading Brexiteer, he’s a false prophet of the worse kind.
2025 2018-07-09 19:29:50 Mate I'm covered in olive oil and am weeping you're good
2026 2018-07-09 19:29:32 Eating less meat, investing in slightly better funds than oil! It's not that hard, I hate that this straw thing is happening. Why can't everyone ban balloons or plastic glitter or microbeads?
2027 2018-07-09 19:29:32 Ya - it’s interesting - State of NJ claims full service petrol pumps (I believe same for State of Oregon) saves jobs / keeps jobs local That’s stated reason Technically, you’re not supposed to exit your car at all at pump It’s FULL service - they check wiper fluid, oil, etc
2028 2018-07-09 19:29:31 Don't even get me started on what that damned hippie natural gas and electricity did to the good old fashioned whale oil lamps industry.
2029 2018-07-09 19:29:29 What the hell are you talking about ? oil production is not the main economy of any of the listed countries . it is a part of it , and taxed like other industries , venezuela is a different story with +50% of their gdp from oil production.
2030 2018-07-09 19:29:27 The Peel of banana  contains physical traces of a kind of oil
2031 2018-07-09 19:29:17 Best chips/fries in town! 

Hash Browns are nice but not nice to the oil as they leave a lot of Potato residue behind.

Beautiful Eyelashes 
Tons of compliments 
No more mascara

They’re costly 
Some places say not to use oil based make up 
Don’t always work if you wear glasses 
Break down your natural eyelashes
2033 2018-07-09 19:29:14 Well if that isn’t just...inconvenient! Have you ever used Clary Sage essential oil? I started using it about 2 months ago and I’m noticing slight changes already!
2034 2018-07-09 19:29:05 Ryanair has banned olive oil in checked baggage. Who knew? Not me who's just had to gift five litres made at D'Annunzio's house to the airport barman, while weeping
2035 2018-07-09 19:29:04 You mean he switches from ISIS ministry of energy after all those oil sales.

2042 2018-07-09 19:28:02 So hyped that the banks can go back to ripping us off and the coal, oil, and chemical companies can go back to poisoning our land, water, and air.
2043 2018-07-09 19:28:01 You can also replace the citronella with lemongrass oil
2044 2018-07-09 19:27:58 Didn't @EamonRyan sign a lot of those licences for offshore oil and gas drilling when he was in Government?
2045 2018-07-09 19:27:58 Brexit is a confidence trick sold by snake oil merchants.

Stop it now.

2047 2018-07-09 19:27:38 Actually Citronelle is quite easy to make up it's just orange and lemon oil
2048 2018-07-09 19:27:34 The three columns I wrote were about the conversations between 5 oil sands CEOs and 5 ENGO exec directors that Berman co-chaired. She was there, her take on those meetings is important, just like Collyers'. Also, the CEOs asked for her to be there. Complain to them, already.

2052 2018-07-09 19:26:29 Especially as the different elements of portfolio come into play. Already so much inherent value here which IMO is not factored into the market cap. For example, one of the founding fathers of Tullow Oil (Graham Martin) as Chairman - a driving force behind Tullow’s success

2055 2018-07-09 19:26:23 @bulletproofexec I have tried CBD oil within an hour of coffee several times. Noticed dry skin with CBD alone but AWFUL when taking within 18 hours of coffee. Reminded me of your experience. Like this with multiple brands of CBD.

2070 2018-07-09 19:24:52 On a valuation basis of oil and refined products today, your spot WTI is valued 1% less than the price of your spot HO, RBOB and Brent flavors. So that means there is a 1% directional move coming prettay, prettay, prettay soon and I hope you're all on the right side if it #OOTT

2073 2018-07-09 19:24:38 YES... Kick Scotland out of the UK.
And let Scotland keep the VAT,  petrol &  diesel tax, tobacco, alcohol and gambling tax,  revenue from North Sea oil and gas, the tax on business profits..... which all currently goes to London. I'll go with that.

2074 2018-07-09 19:24:35 How about a ban  on Big Oil money interference in politics globally starting now.
2075 2018-07-09 19:24:31 My parents had the same issue. They bought their house for $40k when I was 17. Then the oil boom happened and by the time I was 25 their house was worth $300k
2076 2018-07-09 19:24:22 So not only did @midas fix a plastic part that came loose on my car’s undercarriage for free when I got my oil change, they also didn’t try to tell me I needed $800 of work that I ACTUALLY didn’t (unlike a competitor...). Guess I know where I’m getting future oil changes from!

2084 2018-07-09 19:23:38 All depends on any pending danger. Smoke from a car = oil which is bad for every one and won't go away.  When DJ spun the remaining cars had 2.5 miles until there was any danger.  He didn't hit any thing so there was no debris.

2) exfoliant. get a charcoal scrub. holds 1000x it’s weight in oil 
3) toner/ astringent. with oily skin i’d go with an astringent like witch hazel 
4) MOISTURIZE!!!!!!

“Krueger complained to Durant that he and his companies “have been the subject of a deceitful press campaign continually attack our securities.” Ivar became increasingly paranoid about short-sellers, he personally bought large volumes of his companies’ securities”
2091 2018-07-09 19:23:21 That's Big Oil's decision to make. Not Terrible Teresa. Remember what happened to JFK?
2092 2018-07-09 19:23:18 I find combining valerian, passion flower and hops capsules with a couple of drops of CBD oil seems to be working x

2095 2018-07-09 19:23:04 I know, ugh. I think they can impeach him, maybe refuse to seat him, I don’t really know. But I guess a a conduit must remain in place for the ongoing oil and gas corruption. Pruitt would be a good conductor.
2096 2018-07-09 19:22:57 Quinn got a package delivered to our house that looks like it’s been chewed on by rats and it’s covered in motor oil. Needless to say, but we got an old fashioned bomb on our hands boys.

2098 2018-07-09 19:22:55 Hearing @RizzShow talking about The Melting Pot makes me wonder what he thinks about Korean BBQ.  Not as much oil cooking, but plenty of splatter too.
2099 2018-07-09 19:22:51 The initial tweet I quoted is drawing a comparison between 2008 price of oil of above $100 per barrel to current of around $80 per barrel and questioning why we paying more now without taking into account the exchange rate at the exchange rate then.

2105 2018-07-09 19:21:28 If everybody wants to buy oil even with the taxes I think it will be really expensive... but what if nobody wants to buy it??? No demand means low prices?? Who has to make the first move?

2173 2018-07-09 19:14:46 which brand and % wise, as i myself also had that issue but found it was due to a low quality, plus at the time it was only 3%. we only use encoda now, and use either 15 or 20% paste or oil drops, but they do have a bunch of other products, even vape, give them a shout
2174 2018-07-09 19:14:40 Kuwait, was poor and turned into rich due to oil. Personally, I believe a proper education is a good start.

2197 2018-07-09 19:11:50 The charge against Mr Salmond was not price..but volatility.

The risk level was beyond catastrophic basing budget assumptions upon oil.

Salmond based his entire case upon oil.

SGC have dissed him & predict doom

Aka inescapable truth

2199 2018-07-09 19:11:48 Both songs and albums are good, but a song is a sketch, and the album is the full watercolour. Or oil. Or whatever, art analogies aren't my thing.  It's coherent in a way releasing 14 songs separately, even if they're intended to form an album at the end, won't be. I don't think.

2212 2018-07-09 19:10:35 But there's also other players. Netanyahu didn't like the deal too, insisting Iran was hiding something. Iran denies this.

So if US sanctions Iran's oil, other buyers will have to look for another supplier which would then drain their supply. Like Saudi & Libya (the lowest).

2222 2018-07-09 19:09:39 “Roll Out the Barrels!”: US Crude oil production has hit an all-time high, lowering prices about $9/barrel less than competitors. Asian refiners import less oil from the Middle East & Russia and more from the US. Last month about half of all US crude export went to Asia.
2223 2018-07-09 19:09:31 I never said they cook with it. They don’t cook in soybean oil. But they do have it as an ingredient in just about everything. Please look at their ingredient list. I believe they use it in their chicken marinade, all the sauces, the bread... etc... correct me if I’m wrong

Would you please tell me if the dishes marked as vegan on your menu are cooked using the same oil as non-vegan dishes, or if they're cooked, for example, using the same utensils & pans without being washed beforehand.

2265 2018-07-09 19:05:06 The markit pmi series are fairly young. Even so there's definitely something bigger than the data (by markit) driving these economies. Eg take Nigeria - PMI has been solidly above 50+ since the start of 2017 yet there's been hardly any GDP growth hppning outside the oil sector.

Guaranteed to change your life. 
Frying chicken wings is a whole new experience. Idc when I season the chicken, it always tastes like it's been marinating for forever!
And it's "healthier" because you use little to no oil. 
I'm still fat, tho. So.
2284 2018-07-09 19:03:25 I personally still prime and powder my lids because I have super oily skin. If your using a stick liner those are oil based so it might be inevitable, switching to a gel or liquid liner might help as well.
2285 2018-07-09 19:03:20 I was taking a nap and I wake up because I hear this loud popping so I go into the kitchen and the floor is coated in oil and the stove is covered in oil.

2334 2018-07-09 18:58:18 Lol wtf there are people named Fish Oil?
2335 2018-07-09 18:58:18 Yeah I also did it myself after researching the difference between oil and washer fluid

2351 2018-07-09 18:56:51 @NutellaUSA Hey, just wondering when you're going to stop using palm oil. I enjoy Nutella very much but I can no longer do so in good conscience, knowing how palm oil is obtained. I look forward to enjoying Nutella again!

2354 2018-07-09 18:56:27 Wells produce a mix of frac fluid, microscopic fragments of shale, formation water, oil, natural gas liquids. @BInapples @WoodwarddianneJ
2355 2018-07-09 18:56:25 See, a pre-heated tin and hot oil make all the difference .

2357 2018-07-09 18:56:23 oily skin is a blessing 
naturally oil produces in the skin and its good for the skin 
no artificial and chemically produced lotions and creams are needed for this type of skin

2359 2018-07-09 18:56:10 Every time I come to get a oil change they telling me some unrelated info about my car, idc that my head gasket is missing and I won't make it down the road just change my damn oil
2360 2018-07-09 18:55:46 Omg the place I get my oil change at has a PS4 setup to play while waiting on your car to get serviced. I’m so tempted to play it.

2366 2018-07-09 18:54:45 @RachelNotley drop this insane idea that future children should be paying off a debt to make a few oil companies money and destroy the planet in the process such that these same children will not enjoy the quality of life you seem to think can be propped up by buying a pipeline
2367 2018-07-09 18:54:45 Not out east. I’ve gotten into some tense arguments with people who swear by it. Like, why would you want to not only taste the burned oil in your donut, but also taste that the oil likely hasn’t been changed in days?
2368 2018-07-09 18:54:38 Awwww definitely Adrian should be back on LSE
2369 2018-07-09 18:54:32 I saw the footage of the vintage bus, and my useless brain decided that the squeaky brakes needed some oil...
2370 2018-07-09 18:54:13 I've been making a salad with cucumber, carrot, chopped mint and coriander, chopped/crushed nuts, then a dressing of soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, lime juice and chilli flakes. Then add quorn / tofu, veg to give texture and soak up flavour. It's so refreshing and tasty.
2371 2018-07-09 18:53:47 Yay! Glad to hear, I sub the BBQ sauce for olive oil and it's nice to know my wife can enjoy the Pangoa bowl if she holds the cheese. So delicious. Thank you!!
2372 2018-07-09 18:53:32 double cleanser itu dengan dua jenis bahan pembersih yaitu oil dan water. jadi dua step oil cleanser-water cleanser-baru fw dilanjut skincare lain.

o iya milk cleanser tidak termasuk oil ya. jadi walau kamu makenya milk cleanser-water cleanser, tidak bisa disebut double cleanser

2376 2018-07-09 18:52:30 I’ve never heard a fella scream sooo much apart from the time I put a few large bottles of Albas oil into his bath! He was so worried about being sterile as it burnt his bits!
2377 2018-07-09 18:52:19 Bruh having a newer car is so expensive  I came in for a oil change and this man said $80 like ummm I know it’s synthetic but damn!!
2378 2018-07-09 18:52:08 new foundation trick: i mix my foundations bcs my of my skin tone...and i add in a few drops of Tarte Maracuja Oil 

oh yeah, primer is important
2379 2018-07-09 18:51:46 I think it’s crazy. I could make 10 pills last a year now because I use kratom but my docs won’t give me those because I told him I use CBD oil. He used to give me 70 pills a month! Now I can’t have even 10 for a year because I’m using a plant
2380 2018-07-09 18:51:41 Did they ask when you'll release the 1000s of children from Trump cages? If you'll protect women's right to control their own bodies? How much you got from big oil to drill on public lands?
2381 2018-07-09 18:51:37 Have you guys ever used CBD oil? I feel like theirs is so expensive and it’s always like a commercial with them. I get it, but I wonder if it’s all hype. I’ve only used Blue Moon because I got it on a killer deal.
2382 2018-07-09 18:51:29 Putin helped elect Trump because Trump promised to unleash America's energy sector so Russia would have more competition for it's major export product - oil.  He didn't want Hillary and her climate change religion keeping American oil in the ground. Got it?
2383 2018-07-09 18:51:28 TRAFFIC ALERT: SH1 West Northbound at County Road 1580, 3 miles south of Ada is closed due to an accident involving a rolled over oil rig truck
2384 2018-07-09 18:51:26 He slick talks you into a "snake oil" purchase. Umma gets angry at you, finds and confronts "Ken", gets slick talked, and comes back to the store with more "snake oil"

2387 2018-07-09 18:50:53 My skin is really soft because I use baby oil to take off my makeup and somehow it doesn't give me pimples
2388 2018-07-09 18:50:49 Never gonna forget the time in home bargains I got to the check out buying drinks and some baby oil an the cashier asked me when my due date is and when I told her I wasn’t pregnant she hesitated and under her breath said “oh”. Wanted the ground to swallow me up, happy Monday x
2389 2018-07-09 18:50:30 That oil change wait feel like you waiting for 1 person to finish reading taks test lol
2390 2018-07-09 18:50:26 Indeed, as the forced depression of the Greek economy showed the Euro useless, the removal of Iranian oil from DEU and FRA showed the EU obselete.

Both are a bloody waste of American time and treasure.

The nation-state again will flourish.
2391 2018-07-09 18:50:09 Not that I am justifying anything, but at least oil makes sense from a global hegemony perspective. Oil has won and lost world wars. But fruit?!? Like “oh we don’t like the possibility of unionization, let’s change that.” Wild. Making us great again, no doubt.
2392 2018-07-09 18:50:08 I am about to bathe in tea tree oil just to stop itching holy shit
2393 2018-07-09 18:50:05 Seems to me, given his tweets aimed at #OPEC, that Trump will try to do everything in his power to bring down gas prices and therefore, oil prices, to help in the elections, as I have heard.

Plus, Russia has been itching to exit the OPEC+ production cut deal for a while now...
2394 2018-07-09 18:49:43 Yall should oil up and film it

2397 2018-07-09 18:49:06 Highly recommend getting your oil changed at the new Valvoline right near the Swansea mall. You don’t even have to get out of the car they do the oil change below you. Was barely even 15 minutes!!!
2398 2018-07-09 18:49:03 No like my hair doesn’t get greasy any more! I really think the extensions just suck all the oil outta my actual hair lol I wash it after the lake on Sunday then don’t have to wash it again until we go back to the lake! I love it 
2399 2018-07-09 18:49:02 Neosporin and tea tree oil! Resist the itch, and feel better!
2400 2018-07-09 18:48:41 These oil cartridges is way better than smoking actual weed.
2401 2018-07-09 18:48:37 At the same time all those Midwest factories reopen, rehire, and begin producing, after being “tombstones across America”.  You’re so full of crap. You’re every snake oil salesman ever.
2402 2018-07-09 18:48:20 Having big thighs is cool but when summer is here it’s hell. 

Use coconut oil to avoid thigh burn
2403 2018-07-09 18:48:03 I think I'm going to stop eating lamb altogether... I just dry grilled some lamb for dinner and I extracted no less than 3 tablespoons of oil from it.

Yeses.
2404 2018-07-09 18:48:00 my coconut oil melting and then half of it spilling in my suitcase was pure pain
2405 2018-07-09 18:47:54 Accelerated depreciation and oil
2406 2018-07-09 18:47:41 When you’re making rice skip the butter and oil there’s so many other ways to season rice
2407 2018-07-09 18:47:39 This is embarrassing and hilarious all in one
2408 2018-07-09 18:47:22 Yes. The question is why isn’t the whole country?

He tells you the impossible before it happens.

2011  Trump will be President 

The economy will explode 

Oil here 

Isis gone 

Energy 

Cabal in prison 

SCOTUS 5 total replacements

Etc, etc.

Why won’t people listen?
2409 2018-07-09 18:47:10 If I'm getting my oil changed and they keep calling me hun or sweetie, I assume I'm being charged more and I'm mad
2410 2018-07-09 18:47:09 This days the way girls like cars ehhhyou will think they were brestfed with Engine oil.
2411 2018-07-09 18:47:03 I did not and never will approve of the Bush invasion of Iraq w/ no proof of 911.  Daddy Bush is evil.  Libya should not have been invaded.  He had already complied to UN, but the idea that he was going to do gold backed currency to trade oil w/ Russia caused invasion.
2412 2018-07-09 18:46:46 I take capsules with fish oil. They are good quality and you don't feel any taste. Nutrilite is the company that produces it. Their supplements are also used by AC Milan and the Chinese Olympic sportsmen. If you need more information then I will happily provide it.
2413 2018-07-09 18:46:40 1. Break an egg and whisk it in a bowl.
2. Pour two spoons of olive oil in a small container.
3. Warm up the oil for 10 seconds.
4. Mix them together then put it in your hair.
5. Put a plastic or shower cap for and hour or two. 
6. Rinse it off and wash your hair as usual.
2414 2018-07-09 18:46:36 started using this argan oil hair mask and let me tell you it changed my LIFE
2415 2018-07-09 18:46:26 Just cooked some v similar ones thin sliced and pan fried with garlic in olive oil. First of the season done that way. yum.

2419 2018-07-09 18:45:49 I’ve been using CBD oil for the past week and I’m honestly shocked. 

CBD oil has helped me control my insomnia and my anxiety. I’ve been falling asleep earlier and noticed I’ve been worrying less about small things.

I know it’s only been a week, but I #SupportCBD
2420 2018-07-09 18:45:39 just wait til I tell my mom about this olive oil scam
2421 2018-07-09 18:45:37 Who wants to go into combat fighting an alleged enemy for Oil; or, to prop up some Dictator or Madman?  We aren't fighting to win; but, to keep the supply pipe-lines open for the Military Industrial Complex so they can continue gouging Taxpayers for grossly overpriced equipment.
2422 2018-07-09 18:45:36 Sorry doesnt fix broken hair bonds that couldve been avoided with a lil help of oil
2423 2018-07-09 18:45:33 My gramma just ended our phone call with “stay out of the sun” this is coming from the same lady who rubs me down with olive oil when i lay out and tan

2438 2018-07-09 18:43:39 I don't support Kremlin but they are better off standing against USA's quest for a unipolar world, where they set up military bases everywhere and arm terrorists for regime changes wherever there is oil. Look at what they did to Libya?

2443 2018-07-09 18:43:00 Zinc, magnesium, boron, & fish oil are all pretty solid. Wouldn’t be surprised if Uridine Monophosphate has a significant effect too. Tried those?
2444 2018-07-09 18:42:58 For nuclear plants and oil. Still will not satisfy the vicious and voracious, fragile egos of the world's most heinous narcissists.

2447 2018-07-09 18:42:36 70% of olive oil sold in the U.S. stores is fake, as  they have been cut with cheaper, inferior oils like canola and sunflower  oil! This is similar to the 2008 practice in Italy.

2472 2018-07-09 18:39:32 Would they do that if this was "a tight market" like Amrita Sen keeps pushing? No, they wouldn't. She is a fraud, and the clues keep coming on just how much this oil market isn't tight.

2476 2018-07-09 18:38:32 Yeah that tweet didn't age Well!

Was in Venezuela prior to his election as he nationalized the oil fields.

There was great hope for his agenda.

True house of cards in the end.

2477 2018-07-09 18:38:23 CBD oil will help with your anxiety.. please believe me when I say so!
2478 2018-07-09 18:38:03 Sometimes it's too heavy, but after my brother's stroke when we were all learning to cook more healthy, olive oil was a lifesaver. it imparts a little bit of salty flavor!
2479 2018-07-09 18:38:03 cop the mario badescu drying oil, that shits magic imo
2480 2018-07-09 18:37:44 few drops peppermint essential oil rubbed on whatever body part hurts, regular stretching before bed, upping water and sodium intake to reduce muscle cramping, alternating hot/cold packs all SAVED MY LIFE !!! i have chronic hip/back pain and this all helped me LOTS!
2481 2018-07-09 18:37:38 "Wow... rude... then again i'm dating junko... so of course people hate me"
2482 2018-07-09 18:37:37 lemon grass oil every morning
2483 2018-07-09 18:37:24 ''So.. like.. how have you been?''
2484 2018-07-09 18:37:16 I had to drive my dad's truck to highland to get the oil changed for him and while I was driving there I was like 5 minutes into listening to country music when I screamed and realized what was happening. Confirmed loud trucks induce enjoyment of country music.
2485 2018-07-09 18:37:14 Must be an oil & gas guy
2486 2018-07-09 18:37:09 @jonlovett OMG, fuck truffle oil. I love u jon lovett

2488 2018-07-09 18:36:56 @eNCA Fuel: The then Minister of transport, Tina Joemat-Petersen, sold the country's reserve stocks of oil valued at just over R7billion, for R5billion. That's a loss of R2billion which is then recovered from South African motorists in the fuel price!
2489 2018-07-09 18:36:54 I’m so blessed that my man knows how to change oil, tires, and a battery. God knows the amount of idiots I’ve met that can’t do 1/3 of those things.
2490 2018-07-09 18:36:45 @realDonaldTrump Please get us out of Syria and Afghanistan ! The Rothschilds are just getting rich. We have all the oil we need, right here. Why are we fighting FOR ISIS? They're playing you !
2491 2018-07-09 18:36:15 good thing with eco olive oil: eco
bad thing with eco olive oil: tastes like piss mixed with oil
2492 2018-07-09 18:36:10 This man should have to pay a big find, go to jail and take long hours of class about oil pollution laws.
2493 2018-07-09 18:36:04 Bitch I work in Odessa on the oil fields
2494 2018-07-09 18:35:50 yeah, with oil and vinegar? Totally normal craving.
2495 2018-07-09 18:35:50 Pro tip: Even in Texas, they're smart enough not to produce oil that they can't get to market.  

Production capacity is greater than transportation capacity.  They won't actually produce the black line.

Verdict: Bad chart
2496 2018-07-09 18:35:49 What’s better than sand and oil money
2497 2018-07-09 18:35:43 Why not? Grill it with some olive oil and fresh garlic and it's bomb.

2502 2018-07-09 18:35:20 Lovely. If the baingan is super good quality i just add raw chopped onions, green chillies, coriander and dash of raw mustard oil.
Common in bengal and bihar.

2504 2018-07-09 18:35:10 Okay I wont, use coconut oil?

2507 2018-07-09 18:34:53 @Valvoline is the best thing to have happened to oil changes 
2508 2018-07-09 18:34:52 Take heart bro,may God give you the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss.
2509 2018-07-09 18:34:44 I hear ya! That's why I love our Everyday Herbal drops because it's cheaper then our pure CBD oil. And plus the essential oil Copaiba helps enhance the effects of the CBD oil.
2510 2018-07-09 18:34:38 Oh I thought we were just talking about olives themselves, I love olive oil
2511 2018-07-09 18:34:38 Car jack check , transmission oil check , brake cleaner check , ok ok let’s get to it .
2512 2018-07-09 18:34:28 Jack put olive oil in his vape Cus it ‘looked the same’ and got the shits for 3 days
2513 2018-07-09 18:34:16 I love CBD oil bruh I’m so chill
2514 2018-07-09 18:34:11 #Brexit is a dishonest empty slogan driven ideology, pure snake oil.
2515 2018-07-09 18:34:11 oil bunkering at its peak
2516 2018-07-09 18:34:10 If you don't change your oil at Jiffy Lube, you're living in the past.
2517 2018-07-09 18:34:05 Perfectly put. DeMo hit SMBs hard, many permanently shutting down with thousands of jobs lost. Also increase in RIL is somewhat linked to rise in oil prices, thereby inflating the RIL bottom line.
2518 2018-07-09 18:34:00 It’s still a little behind oil. See also: Operation Ajax.
2519 2018-07-09 18:33:58 Looking through my pictures I saw an oil painting I did. I deeply regret giving one of my best paintings to a person I don’t even have good ties with now, like damn it was a big canvas and I put 4 days of work into it. Lowkey wish I I could have it back.
2520 2018-07-09 18:33:54 Done. Take it to him since you ears are alive
2521 2018-07-09 18:33:52 Olive oil is ok, in moderation. And it's pretty low sodium!
2522 2018-07-09 18:33:44 Use Bio oil girl 
2523 2018-07-09 18:33:42 ''What thing?''
2524 2018-07-09 18:33:30 @FatKidDeals any essential oil deals?
2525 2018-07-09 18:33:20 I often wonder what happens if 9/11 happens on Gore's watch. Presumably Afghanistan invasion happens, Iraq doesn't, and Gore makes "reducing foreign oil dependency" his patriotic appeal for environmentalism.
2526 2018-07-09 18:33:15 So if  we can expect the same results on drugs that POTUS produced on Oil Price, NKorea, Draining the swamp, Immigration, and most everything else he comments on, I would go Very Long a basket of notorious pharma gougers

2528 2018-07-09 18:32:54 The Nigerian Government clearly can’t run an oil company(NNPC) profitably how much more an airline where profit margins are ridiculously low.
2529 2018-07-09 18:32:46 "I only came here to give you advice really"
2530 2018-07-09 18:32:32 Many states choose industry money over protecting the environment. That's why NIXON created the EPA in the first place. So #stfu and let the EPA protect our air, water and wildlife. Lord knows Big Oil won't do it.
2531 2018-07-09 18:32:30 ''Souda? What are you doing?''

She doesn't kiss back.
2532 2018-07-09 18:32:30 I sure do! As a mom, I was suffering from anxiety, depression and sleep deprivation. But CBD oil has changed all that! Now I'm a better mom to my boys. Also, it helps alot with my cramps when I'm PMSing.
2533 2018-07-09 18:32:18 Oil, vinegar, and oregano on subs is a lost art
2534 2018-07-09 18:32:08 I bet you were dwarfed! Do they grow them to crop them for sunflower oil?
2535 2018-07-09 18:31:35 #ROG #Economy In June, the National Welfare Fund received a 900-billion-ruble boost (14 billion USD) from oil income saved last year, i.e. budget revenues from higher-than-anticipated oil & gas tax revenues.

2538 2018-07-09 18:30:45 a pattern I often notice is how when someone calls another by something (often in aggress) the something often describes the caller moreso than the called
2539 2018-07-09 18:30:43 When you’re waiting for a call back about your oil change and you call them almost 2 hours later and they say, “oh yeah, you’re finished.” Looooove it!

2543 2018-07-09 18:30:10 Its ridiculous here in Oak Grove. Any advice? We've sprayed Neem Oil and have 2 traps out. The bags fill up daily and it doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon.
2544 2018-07-09 18:30:08 AMZN, XLE (even with oil red), and the banks. It’s the trifecta you want to see if you’re bullish.
2545 2018-07-09 18:30:07 @TricepBrah @jadakissi Cmon Pasta. Bio said greedy scientists made all that bullshit up so they can continue to make hundreds to thousands of dollars. In the meantime billion dollar oil companies have our best interests at heart. @BioHazardSperm
2546 2018-07-09 18:30:00 It doesn't work as well on curly hair because it tends to be dry. Coconut oil helps.

2552 2018-07-09 18:28:39 Wait, does that mean my car insurance shouldn't pay for oil changes and new wiper blades?

2554 2018-07-09 18:28:20 Or time to begin paying for our services instead of hoping oil from ground (depleting capital) does it. (Lowest Canada income tax & no sales tax). #ableg #cdnpoli we don’t have to “gut” our schools, hospitals & roads. #AlbertaAdvantageWasLikePerpetualMotion #Unsustainable
2555 2018-07-09 18:28:20 Gut instinct on complex geopolitical and shadowy back-room GOP / oil lobbyist inputs on the future price of oil - from American truckers. Yeah, forward me those results!  I’ll start trading in oil futures. Can’t lose...
2556 2018-07-09 18:28:14 I'd rather see wingmills and solar panels everywhere than oil pumping or nuke plants

2558 2018-07-09 18:27:14 I don't know of any oil & gas companies that have a single person capable of fixing a piece in a vast pipeline system that is live-or-die for the organization
2559 2018-07-09 18:27:04 .....only cause it's not fun aching in them places every time you get up off the chair. Or floor. Or bed. No fun.
So yes please to the oil and the fingers. Especially the fingers.

2561 2018-07-09 18:26:33 4 tires and some Marvels Mystery Oil and we are back in business!

2566 2018-07-09 18:25:38 what olive oil should i be using?
2567 2018-07-09 18:25:35 Hahaa, don't take much convincing do you? Fair enough, little one.
And maybe some lavender oil to go with it.
2568 2018-07-09 18:25:30 The US currently imports 10.1 million barrels of oil per day - $640 million that leaves the US Economy on a daily basis - $238 billion untaxed oil dollars go to Canada, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries rather that stay in the US. #invest #investing #oil #finance #energy

2586 2018-07-09 18:23:40 After this oil change, straight to the gym
2587 2018-07-09 18:23:39 nah it's the sector. Shale oil and shale gas. Fracking. That sort of shit. Companies that are doing that shit all around the country/world. I bought like 4 earlier.

2590 2018-07-09 18:23:11 I like a lamb and Guinness stew or lamb and noodles which I grew up with. Of course rack of lamb crusted with breadcrumbs, garlic, parsley, olive oil and mustard is pretty good too. That was a tough battle.

2595 2018-07-09 18:22:16 my moms the realist for getting my oil changed, fixing my brakes and filling my tank 
2596 2018-07-09 18:22:11 Cause it would be unsafe for the chefs cooking with fire, hot oil, etc.
2597 2018-07-09 18:21:34 I wish Honda had lounging chairs so I could take a nap while I wait for this oil change.

2605 2018-07-09 18:20:54 I think I fucked up by not buying infused oil & vinegar. Lol  I bought some flavored seasonings, but I may need to add some more to get the flavor more forward.
2606 2018-07-09 18:20:50 We're working on it. Slowly.

Our oil vampires shut down their disposal wells, so I only get an earthquake occasionally now instead of multiple times a week.

2613 2018-07-09 18:19:42 But Oyinkan, that's a full bowl of palm oil stew. Did they carry the bowl horizontally inside a box? Or good old cool bag?
2614 2018-07-09 18:19:35 Oh dear, I knew the 70s in the UK weren’t easy but I had no idea that power cuts were a regular occurrence. I remember my parents telling me about car-free Sundays in Germany during the oil crisis, but having no electricity sounds much worse.

2618 2018-07-09 18:18:56 Response? You only respond to what you know is happening. We’re still trying to discover oil in Chad.

2622 2018-07-09 18:18:31 Fun fact: Eyebrows are for wicking sweat and oil away from your eyes 

Not-fun fact: If you sweat enough it doesn't effing work and your eyes become filled with dat sweet sweet saltwater
2623 2018-07-09 18:18:10 So true. unfortunately it's all about the money. That's why hemp & cannabis were made illegal in the first place, too many people invested in forest, cotton & oil industries didn't want to lose money to hemp. Since then other industries have jumped on board.
2624 2018-07-09 18:17:43 Oh yeah i did have a lot of fun doing it bex i did write it in a manner that it was sort of torturous by the way I beat you too it with the drink lol I was sponsoring a car oil company called Duckhams
2625 2018-07-09 18:17:41 Anyone else just nod and say okay when they show you your oil while getting it changed cause u don’t know what the HELL you’re looking at cause same
2626 2018-07-09 18:17:37 I better be sucking my double shot from an illustration of baby jesus pouring out a bottle of Frankincense oil this christmas.
2627 2018-07-09 18:17:24 Yes, it also prevents the bumps from happening, there is actually a mix with the lemon juice and apple cider vinegar already together I just added it to my tea tree oil witch hazel
2628 2018-07-09 18:17:18 Poach some chopped garlic in the unused oil from a jar of sun-dried tomatoes and then mix it all through mashed potatoes @TwopTwips
2629 2018-07-09 18:17:01 A group of MIT materials scientists created LiquiGlide, a surface that allows anything to roll off of it like oil on a frying pan.
2630 2018-07-09 18:16:52 BEWARE: Motorists are advised to be cautious when driving past The Glen Shopping Centre. According to a resident, there was an oil spill earlier. Drive with caution!
2631 2018-07-09 18:16:52 Bush..oil..War..guns..absolutely...
You don’t go into a country..rip it off and walk. Two cultures collide. They resented us...  what all countries have done..invade..for spices..gold..diamonds..
It has consequences.

2635 2018-07-09 18:16:25 Devil May Fry. 
Satan fancies a nice greasy fry-up, but hasn't yet checked the cupboard for cooking oil. Will he or will he not be able to fry? Only you decide!
2636 2018-07-09 18:16:12 Thinks to self "I'm gunna use some avocado oil as moisturizer today. My skin will be beautiful and glowing."

*gets in friends car* "murph what are you cooking?? You smell like french fries."
2637 2018-07-09 18:16:05 Pro tip: make your eggs and chorizo vegan by cooking it in vegetable oil

2639 2018-07-09 18:15:50 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
2640 2018-07-09 18:15:35 I took my car into the shop to find out I needed a oil change...170 down the drain.
2641 2018-07-09 18:15:20 I will pour you anointing oil.

2646 2018-07-09 18:14:53 surprising how many use palm oil !
2647 2018-07-09 18:14:48 Uh oh. Possibly something cooked in peanut oil?
2648 2018-07-09 18:14:28 Genie oil .
2649 2018-07-09 18:14:20 No. They are separate markets, like, say oil and stocks. Stock in an oil company existing does not change this.

This partly explains why the hubbub about "security tokens" is off the mark. Upgrading the system will only benefit the main industry players, not the masses.
2650 2018-07-09 18:14:19 Religion is all around us. Backward, medieval male dominated cults. If the true will was there to change things, we stopped all the placating,funding, tolerance and respect of 'culture', think what we could achieve. Have to find an alternative to oil first!

2653 2018-07-09 18:13:54 Why do people care about Venezuela? We have gold. We have oil... What could they possibly want?
2654 2018-07-09 18:13:52 More copy-pasta #GOPTaxScam lies published by #YellowRag @Troydailynews. You can keep trying to sell this snake oil, but no one is buying.
2655 2018-07-09 18:13:46 when yall run out of oil yall can just use my face theres enough to last two years at the very least
2656 2018-07-09 18:13:41 Honest question: Do you support immunization for children? I automatically feel like tossing oil enthusiasts opinions aside because of the anti-vax movement. Just curious if your children have been vaccinated. It’s quite the platform you have on Bravo.

2659 2018-07-09 18:12:49 @DominicRaab are you another #scottpruitt ? Paid for by oil companies? or do you understand what human caused climate change is about.
2660 2018-07-09 18:12:38 I just blew on the cartridge and checked the oil and reset the router. That seemed to fix it.

2665 2018-07-09 18:12:20 That’s an amazing idea, I wish I had thought of that. My landlady has freely admitted she has no money, so I’ve spent a lot of money on doing up the house (even though it’s rented). When I learnt it needed a new heating system (its oil) that’s what pushed me to buy my own!
2666 2018-07-09 18:12:06 The guy changing my oil told me to “have a great rest of your Saturday” lol will do.
2667 2018-07-09 18:12:05 Go ahead and mock me. But you can't refute the claim because it's a fact. Bill was a recipient of an incredible boom. 43 recipient of the bust.

2669 2018-07-09 18:11:37 Is it possible there's more to measuring Alberta's success than by oil? I like to think there's more than that that makes our Province successful.
2670 2018-07-09 18:11:34 I know my car needed that oil change but damn did it hurt my wallet 
2671 2018-07-09 18:11:31 Elevator stranger: Whats that delicious smell?

2679 2018-07-09 18:09:56 Ha ha!  A load of lads from my way work on the oil rigs off Scotland.  They put this on the jucky  in a boozer in Aberdeen.  Guy behind the bar presses the reject button, it's alright though, coz they've selected it 58 times.  
2680 2018-07-09 18:09:49 If only had that power with oil lol
2681 2018-07-09 18:09:46 Interesting read…. The conclusion “Cannabis oil ‘down there’, Tishler said, might improve blood flow and sensitivity, “but most sexuality happens above the neck…”
2682 2018-07-09 18:09:46 Midnight Oil, definitely.
2683 2018-07-09 18:09:44 You ever see the movie ffolkes? Roger Moore plays a cranky old cat enthusiast and commando trainer sent to defuse a terrorist takeover of an oil rig on behalf of an insurance company.
2684 2018-07-09 18:09:36 I came to the dealership just to get an oil change and now I’m here about to trade my car in 
2685 2018-07-09 18:09:30 Hi Brandy! Thank you for taking the time to let us know about the out of the out of stock status of the olive oil mayo and Dr. Pepper as well as the frozen French fries. We will send these comments to the store leadership. Thank you and have a great day!

2687 2018-07-09 18:09:04 Sadly I didn’t beat all the moms to Jiffy lube for an oil change this morning. 
Feels like I ‘m trapped in a small hot hell room with smelly feet, two annoying Netflix movies on blast (that no one is paying attention to), screaming kids and uncaring moms on their phones.

2693 2018-07-09 18:08:25 Weird that one minute at birth, it's not a baby and the next min it is. For Christians a question, at what moment is the Soul " installed?" Seriously, can anyone answer that?
2694 2018-07-09 18:08:19 Snowflake workout!
2695 2018-07-09 18:08:00 If lollipop lamb chops marinated in olive oil, garlic and rosemary, then grilled until medium rare does not do it for you, there is no hope. Eat beef.
2696 2018-07-09 18:07:44 It's a good thing that in Canada we don't have that going on. After all we do have the highest environmental standards in the world when it comes to the oil and gas industry.

2698 2018-07-09 18:07:29 To grow my brows and lashes I use a mixture of coconut oil, vitamin e, castor oil, and sweet oil. I swear this worked this isn't for you to check my page out but to see if for yourself; if you go back on my Instagram you will see my brows/ lashes before and now same name.

2704 2018-07-09 18:06:25 Do you believe gas prices are more impacted by cap and trade than by OPEC? High oil prices are worldwide, and are not caused by Doug Ford.

Did Doug Ford promise sub-$1 beer? No wonder he won!

2733 2018-07-09 18:01:16 Instead of war. Countries should settle disputes through sports. Like if your team wins the World Cup well stop coming here and stealing your oil

2747 2018-07-09 17:59:52 Yes; you pay for the slaughter of innocent people. And you don't think that we should have the ability to decide voluntarily to contribute. As for oil, who do you think owns the oil companies?
2748 2018-07-09 17:59:52 Will taxpayers then own up too all oil spills $$$$$
2749 2018-07-09 17:59:50 Anyone have any recommendations for moisturizing braids? This oil ain’t cutting it.
2750 2018-07-09 17:59:44 I felt it did yeah. I bought lilash for my lashes but once or twice a week I brushed it through my brows as well, maybe that did the trick I have no clue if it was that or the castor oil or both tbh, but before that, they didn't grow at all 
2751 2018-07-09 17:59:34 A Socialist plot to keep the oil flowing at a good price. What an ideological quandary for Alberta conservatives, what intellectual convulsions will be required!
2752 2018-07-09 17:59:31 They have the later, and they have oil which the world still runs on, and we don't have.
2753 2018-07-09 17:59:30 The question is how much oil do I wanna bring home from CO
2754 2018-07-09 17:59:29 i have to go get an oil change but i don’t wanna get out of bed and deal with the world
2755 2018-07-09 17:59:29 Im thankful i actually love sardines. Finding them in spring water only is a bit of a hassle though. My costco still only has them in soybean oil. Yuck!!

This week our local store has spring water ones  for . 99 cents a can. So i bought 20!

And I see more noise in my picture at low light on OnePlus 6 pls make an update @getpeid and @oneplus .@OnePlus_IN
2768 2018-07-09 17:58:07 There's a big leap from saying, "Let's make a new thing, an interstate highway." and "let's nationalize the oil industry."

2770 2018-07-09 17:57:59 I retired from Commercial fishing in 2012. Started in 1977. Did you know the high tide marks on the pilings and seawall are in the same exact spot's?  One spot I found in 1986 is 93ft deep. Same spot, 25 years later.... its still 93 feet deep + BP's oil
2771 2018-07-09 17:57:54 Probably not gonna go back to jiffy lube for an oil change but hey they vacuumed the floors of my car and cleaned all my windows.
2772 2018-07-09 17:57:35 Story of my life. I got my oil changed last weeks and they told me I need new break and tires ASAP. Yesss let me whip out the $1200 you quoted me that I do not have sitting around

2776 2018-07-09 17:57:13 Man, that's still better than me so I wouldn't call yourself bad.
I have to have save states, its just even more impossible otherwise. However one night I was able to play Sonic 2 up to Oil Ocean (I feel you) on the Genesis but died immediately. I will never forget that day...

2779 2018-07-09 17:56:54 Today has been a nice, but busy with Michael.  Had breakfast with my bff Thera, got oil changed, tires taken care of, gas and now to potentially see another friend today before heading back to hang with my mom.
2780 2018-07-09 17:56:46 To early to hit the oil?
2781 2018-07-09 17:56:40 Vaseline is bad for you though use castor oil..
2782 2018-07-09 17:56:40 I know people with old ass cars still taking them to dealers. So they end up paying more for some crappy oil
2783 2018-07-09 17:56:24 Wow it really does feel great to have a washed car and a full tank of gas. No time for oil change :(, but that must be done on Wednesday!
2784 2018-07-09 17:56:16 The UAE used its oil wealth to become one of the richest countries in the world. With vast oil reserves - how did Nigeria, Angola & Venezuela, fall behind ?!

2790 2018-07-09 17:55:33 I will be like oh yeah yeah that's why I'm so lonely and oil smell to it and it's seeped into the washer and dryer.
2791 2018-07-09 17:55:20 Pretty sure I have used it as a rub for lamb leg.  You could always mix a little with some olive oil and dip bread in it too.

2795 2018-07-09 17:54:59 No
2796 2018-07-09 17:54:43 There is some oil offshore, actually.
2797 2018-07-09 17:54:42 In defense: I prefer earphones at the dentist. Calms me. Makes sense it could calm a child. I get claustrophobic, so I’d definitely want whatever they could easily give me. CBD oil, too
2798 2018-07-09 17:54:40 If you ever able to slap some sesame oil on your panda, it changes lives.
2799 2018-07-09 17:54:40 Strange that if you commit an offence you are entitled to legal advice I. E PUBLIC DEFENDER but if you are recklessly injured by radiation by an oil company legal aid is refused... DISGUSTING

2805 2018-07-09 17:53:53 @rushlimbaugh -El Rushbo-u ever wonder why Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Insurance and many other valuable segments of our economy r vilified by MSM while Big Education w dangerous idiots like @CornelWest are given lofty praise? It’s full of lefties & cost far outpaces inflation
2806 2018-07-09 17:53:38 Higher oil prices, I guess in your bubble the gas prices don't go up around Holidays, or just in time for Vacations! They have done that my entire life! Pfizer, blame that on the pre-existing swamp and their Lobbyist! Trump will deal with the issue as "The Resistance" allows!
2807 2018-07-09 17:53:35 The sweet part is Secretary Zinke will make a fortune as a lobbyist when he's done selling us all out to the oil, gas and mineral exploration and extraction industries.
2808 2018-07-09 17:53:27 finally getting my oil change
2809 2018-07-09 17:53:23 Why we should have #articleVconvention 
Term limits and special carveouts could be addressed.  The power brokers will never limit themselves
2810 2018-07-09 17:53:17 I listened to a meathead podcast a couple of weeks ago and he talked about making kfc style chicken in the Dutch oven (filled with oil) then finishing it indirect with the lid closed. This got me really wanting one
2811 2018-07-09 17:52:58 I always hate getting my oil changed. They always upsell me on blinker fluid and I buy it every gd time.
2812 2018-07-09 17:52:55 Went to get an oil change and the guy BROKE THE INSIDE DOOR HANDLE OFF... and proceeded to blame me

2816 2018-07-09 17:52:42 If only you all didn’t use soybean oil in everything! My daughter is allergic to soy so I can’t have your food anymore. Soy is actually quite a common allergy ( because the protein is so close to dairy). You should consider replacing it with another oil... just saying....
2817 2018-07-09 17:52:38 As long as everyone is sponsored by gas and oil (which we continue to subsidize), and car companies which use them, nothing's gonna change in the media. It's up to us. These stories were all sort of post climate change stories - the info is baked in but you have to know that.
2818 2018-07-09 17:52:29 The only classic games I've ever gotten far in without save states are 2 and Mania. Both times got stuck at Oil Ocean. (Curses Oil Ocean!! Curses!!!!)

Made it to Panic Puppet in Sonic 3D Blast with save states, and beat Sonic Pocket Adventure with save states, but I'm pretty bad

2822 2018-07-09 17:51:55 Maybe you missed the start of the issue. David Attenborough did a documentary Blue Planet 2 and now everyone's worried about plastic in the oceans. It's this, not CO2 or oil use, that's motivating the shift from disposable plastics. Airliners don't drop plastic in the sea.

2831 2018-07-09 17:50:23 What they really mean is its unpatriotic to question government.  The amount they tax/ spend, regulations, laws, and general control. 
Those telling you how it should be would never think of living under the same rules. That's for the masses of collective.

2833 2018-07-09 17:50:15 @sterlingvermin concerning the Haymaker ability. Does this apply to ALL dice rolled, or does it apply to weapon damage? I started thinking how good a bloodhound hexblade would be, and realized you can green flame blade a lot of things. Like oil flasks that can ignite and add dice
2834 2018-07-09 17:50:14 Those are just the paste ingredients, Thai curry's pretty easy though you just heat some paste and oil then cook the meat you want in it add the vegetables and then some coconut milk and summer for a little bit and you're done.
2835 2018-07-09 17:50:01 New development: someone thought I look OLDER than I am. I had to get an oil change so I took the girls I nanny with me and the man asked me “how old are your kids?”. They’re 9 and 12 and he thought I looked old enough to be their mother. I am feeling GREAT.
2836 2018-07-09 17:49:59 if your comfortable using cannabis products CBD oil works really well, they also sell CBD bath salts that you can soak in!

We may have higher gas inv due to high vol of low octane fuels produced by shale oil and not being used in newer autos...?

2843 2018-07-09 17:49:07 Last night I used veg peeler to cut a couple into thin ribbons, put garlic in oil and with lemon zest onto griddle pan and cooked them, added seasoning, chilli flakes and lemon/basil dressing. Eat them warm, not hot. Delicious.
2844 2018-07-09 17:49:01 and independence for Scotland and all the oil money that has been wasted , refunded in full . Got my vote .

2868 2018-07-09 17:46:27 Possible that some cooking oil spattered on the walls near the stove. I'd recommend wiping the walls anywhere near the cooking surface.

2872 2018-07-09 17:45:47 I am not talking about your Alternatives for Energie. Your Oil is your purchasing power. It is the reason why the US does not invade you in the first place. When the Oil goes, so does your wealth and every expensive thing you bought away. I can’t imagine you (1/2)
2873 2018-07-09 17:45:39 The fracturing fluids are pumped inside a "work string" which is concentric with "casing". The casing is perforated to allow the fluids to fracture the oil/gas bearing rock.

2887 2018-07-09 17:43:47 They have access to info. Quite a few former senior coal industry men now climate warriors taking it to coal, oil & gas, like @TimBuckleyIEEFA (I think Tim) & Ian Dunlop. Ex-FF people risk analysis folks tell me behind closed doors FF execs know risk in spite of public language.
2888 2018-07-09 17:43:37 "...him."?  C'mon guys.
2889 2018-07-09 17:43:26 I lease a pathfinder 2016 and in the contract they offer a free oil change during the Lease and we just find out only the first oil change was free and that service department has nothing to do with contracts already made.
2890 2018-07-09 17:43:24 そんな誤魔化しいいんで早く謝ってください。口から出任せほざいてるんだから
2891 2018-07-09 17:43:10 We showed up on a motorcycle and left with 4 loafs of garlic bread in our backpack. The oil soaked through and drenched the bag 
2892 2018-07-09 17:43:09 Anyone who spends $25 with me through @younglivingeo will get a $10 or less oil of their choice free ! Let me know by tomorrow !
2893 2018-07-09 17:43:04 Took my car to get an oil change this morning, did three loads of laundry, cleaned up around the house, grocery shopped & got some paperwork done  so adult
2894 2018-07-09 17:42:32 いいよ。逃げても(*´艸`*)もう見てて可哀想だよ。惨めな奴いじめる気無いんで
2895 2018-07-09 17:42:29 Well if the lands of the free stop the making war on nations with oil and good growing seasons. There would be no migrations. What did the people in power thinking would happen when they destroy others homes.
2896 2018-07-09 17:42:29 Totally recommend CBD oil if you have Severe anxiety  SAY NO TO OPIODS and BENZODIAZEPINES
2897 2018-07-09 17:42:29 Tab se ab tak koi b tradenahi kiya hai , soyabean ki sowing badh rahi hai aur is liye crude palm oil ka import b kam hoga aur overall demand b kam hogi aisa lag raha hai , lekin abhi koi imotional trade nahi chart me cocud me 1700 k aas paas dikhane wala pattern dekh raha hu is
2898 2018-07-09 17:42:25 you may bake in 400 F oven on paper or mat sprayed with olive oil. drop patties out of form onto surface and spray lightly again. 20-25min. turn gently once in between for even cooking
2899 2018-07-09 17:42:09 Am not an economist or oil industry expert, but would suggest there is a clear need to lift the veil on what is a very opaque environment. Something isn’t right.
2900 2018-07-09 17:42:07 Coconut oil is a turnoff.
2901 2018-07-09 17:41:58 Oil ultime
2902 2018-07-09 17:41:56 Maybe you dont remember tech bubble. The graph correlates with rise of the unicorns and subsequent crash. By the way, Clinton carried 5 trillion in debt forward. Surplus thing is a myth. No surplus till debt free.
2903 2018-07-09 17:41:50 boy dem 2 na like fuel and engine oil...u need dem for motor for waka lol

2906 2018-07-09 17:41:32 OMG girl! Get some antibiotic ointment on there asap to help the healing process! Once it's closed and healing, ROSE HIP OIL to help the new skin/ early scarring!
2907 2018-07-09 17:41:29 ive started using the cetaphil oil control moisturizer, it has spf 30 and it kind of smells like sunscreen but it doesn't leave a whitecast on me bcus my skin abosrbs it rather than it just sitting there
2908 2018-07-09 17:41:22 Can't stand May but Cameron was an oil slick. His appalling judgement got us in this #BrexitChaos
2909 2018-07-09 17:41:12 @Omojuwa actually your assessments is what is false. Nigeria is an oil rich country, but Qatar and Kuwait has a a higher production limits, coupled with less population, so it figures that they would have a much higher per revenue..
2910 2018-07-09 17:41:12 Did you drive to a place to change the oil? The oil is probably too hot atm.
2911 2018-07-09 17:40:55 What was the value of the rand vs $ for which a barrel of oil is based?
2912 2018-07-09 17:40:54 Oil companies will buy at a discount price once its built imo. AB Gov may purchase it too.
2913 2018-07-09 17:40:47 Happy birthday ahoy Bishop  Eyo.
Many more years and more oil to your hustle....

2917 2018-07-09 17:40:06 she brings whole gallons of oil and greek olives our grandmas are untouched
2918 2018-07-09 17:40:05 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
2919 2018-07-09 17:39:50 Maybe she'll earn the accolade by launching an in depth, multi-part investigation of Google's ad monopoly and data collection practices that will put Tarbell's takedown of Standard Oil to shame. That would certainly take courage.
2920 2018-07-09 17:39:49 Try smoothies in the morning. Kombucha also works wonders. Supplements like zinc, fish oil and Echinacea. Smaller neals throughout the day and also try eating on smaller plates.
2921 2018-07-09 17:39:46 Common BMW Problems. Oil leaks occur more frequently on vehicles with over 60,000 miles. A common cause of BMW oil leaks are the valve cover gaskets The oil pan gasket is also a likely cause of a BMW oil leak, & will require removal of the front suspension in order to be replaced
2922 2018-07-09 17:39:38 Buying an essential oil diffuser was such a smart decision because my house smells amazing but the sound it makes when it mists literally sounds like my dog licking his ass
2923 2018-07-09 17:39:32 My car nags me about low wiper fluid like it’s more important than gas or oil.
2924 2018-07-09 17:39:20 Aye, and there's more oil left in Scottish waters than has been taken already!
2925 2018-07-09 17:39:17 Cod Liver Oil.
2926 2018-07-09 17:39:16 Be in the 1st twenty to sign up and I personally will hand out free haircuts, dental fillings, and oil changes !! Trust me, i'm an expert in all fields - no silly testing ot licenses needed !! Soon adding bypass surgery! #nvleg

2928 2018-07-09 17:38:43 @ILLUMINATIAM  Because you do not want to accept me In the Illuminati elite because I am pulling you and to hire me and I do not want to oil you I threw a person like you see you I want to be a free I want to sign a contract with you if you want asshole 
2929 2018-07-09 17:38:36 I can't go into cirillas anymore when I'm trying to save money. Walk in for heel straps and walk out w new boots, 3 new outfits, "aphrodisiac oil," mints shaped like dicks and a gem covered g string I don't need
2930 2018-07-09 17:38:31 Anyone who doesn’t use coconut oil is missing out.
2931 2018-07-09 17:38:15 Watched a woman at Subway ask for honey mustard, ranch, southwest sauce, oil, and mayo on a sub. I’m speechless.
2932 2018-07-09 17:37:53 I've been just followed. By a politician from Texas, USA. Now, is this a sign I am going to discover oil?
2933 2018-07-09 17:37:49 No. The debt we have now is from both sides buying votes, appeasing followers because it's not their money. Just like these talking heads that would lobby for carveouts if the thing they advocate for ever happened
2934 2018-07-09 17:37:41 I just put tanning oil on and lay naked by the pool lol
2935 2018-07-09 17:37:39 Is this a sick joke? 
Nicola has congratulated the English Team. I would aso have expected a Lord to know that Scotland pays tax and N.I Westminster benefits from the revenue from Whisky, Oil and other  Scottish goods too many to mention . England do not pay Nicloa's  wages .
2936 2018-07-09 17:37:30 always do your company research before applying kids because this girl almost applied to a research position on climate with a group funded almost entirely by oil/gas/car companies!!!!
2937 2018-07-09 17:37:27 your production is the result of the extreme degree to which Canada subsidizes the Alberta oil patch. Canada’s corporate socialism is great for keeping unsustainable sunset industries afloat. take the tarsands as a prime example
2938 2018-07-09 17:37:27 How will 12 trains operate on a one way railway line?  That's why we are selling crude oil,  very useless heads as leaders.
2939 2018-07-09 17:37:24 Germany made a gas deal, oil and gas from Russia, where they pay billions of dollars to Russia.
2940 2018-07-09 17:37:04 More often than not they get roasted in rapeseed oil, but tomorrow I plan to try a fritter recipe given to us by @Amy_Claridge , looking forward to getting me pinny on! #allotment #Lincolnshire
2941 2018-07-09 17:36:37 Il est vrai que les islamistes qui revent de faire sauter une piscine sont assez rare au Japon.
2942 2018-07-09 17:36:27 i need to take my car to get an oil change but that sounds intimidating and very expensive

2946 2018-07-09 17:35:25 Food for thought..... it IS their norm..... and only illegal in Western culture.... here lies the entire issue (problem)..... Islamic thought process makes this right.... Westerners are appalled..... oil and water DO NOT mix.... just a thought, that’s all 
2947 2018-07-09 17:35:21 U don show?
2948 2018-07-09 17:35:10 Now for liam fox. Why is Dominic Raab taking over when, as a leaver he has witnessed DD resign because leave has been betrayed? That Gove is a snake oil salesman too. He may as well stay with the sinking ship
2949 2018-07-09 17:35:02 What ever happened to the discovery of huge reserves of #freshwater in #Turkana that could supply the entire nation for 70 years...or is oil what we need the more?
2950 2018-07-09 17:34:24 When a truck leaks 3 gallon of oil a day for 2 months and you tear into it!
2951 2018-07-09 17:34:21 Ugh I only want to live in climates where my coconut oil is solid
2952 2018-07-09 17:34:13 Tea tree oil smells so good. I’m addicted to that shit 
2953 2018-07-09 17:34:11 You spend most of your day around knives and boiling oil and you fall prey to a french press?
2954 2018-07-09 17:34:03 About as accurate, truthful as Harry Reid claiming fed taxes are voluntary. 
2955 2018-07-09 17:33:54 Get a Sneak Peak at our 7/10 deals. Tomorrow all keif, cartridges and concentrates are 20% off and receive a free oil slick with purchase!
2956 2018-07-09 17:33:52 I'm pretty sure that the Conservatives would have a problem with the pipeline if they were in gov federally. Until the oil industry is responsive to citizens this dissent will continue in my opinion. @OilGasCanada Plenty of citizens in AB with concerns but no one is listening.
2957 2018-07-09 17:33:49 Y’all, TV is the worst. (I am getting our tire fixed and an oil change and just super hoping that 4yo isn’t paying attention.)
2958 2018-07-09 17:33:30 I want that oil money
2959 2018-07-09 17:32:56 You know it’s hot when your jar of coconut oil melts completely.
2960 2018-07-09 17:32:53 Anything GMO, beef by-products, pasteurized yoghurt, canola oil, tilefish, margarine...
2961 2018-07-09 17:32:46 Point it out to me? It seems as though you're hinting at the idea that our production somehow causes all of you on the West Coast to use oil. In fact, it is the other way around. You are responsible for how much we produce. Stop using, we have no reason to make it!
2962 2018-07-09 17:32:41 yes chávez nationalised some industries which he saw as key but these make only a modest share of the econoy, interestingly enough it was not chávez who nationalised the oil sector that was done under the previous president Lopez
2963 2018-07-09 17:32:26 The debt resulted from massive debt acquired under “Supplyside Theory”.
2964 2018-07-09 17:32:19 She's a comedian not a politician
2965 2018-07-09 17:32:11 Why short oil Manu???

2969 2018-07-09 17:31:42 Equal parts Frankinsence & Myrrh with 1/3 of that ( or somewhat less) of red cedar 
In incense form or essential oil form
While reading or mediating 
The combination of the 3 inhances the front lobe of  brain that houses short term & long term memory. Increasing them both by 30%.
2970 2018-07-09 17:31:36 fucking bad oil leak
2971 2018-07-09 17:31:34 Harry Reid said it was voluntary.
2972 2018-07-09 17:31:34 maaf ya kalau gak membantu. tapi kalau kakak emang gak ngerti skincare, aku saranin pake:

milk cleanser/micellar water, face wash, toner, face oil, dan moisturizer. untuk pagi2 sebelom keluar pakai sunscreen dulu.
2973 2018-07-09 17:31:18 These media outlets put out fake stories all the time! Recently they did a whole bash on coconut oil! They want people unhealthy, they want people poor and dependent upon the tax payer dollars.

2976 2018-07-09 17:31:02 The only good thing that came out of this heatwave last weekend is that I can now easily get to the coconut oil that was in the bottom of the container.  It was looking like a struggle, but God.
2977 2018-07-09 17:30:58 thanks girlie, hemp oil drops came to the rescue 
2978 2018-07-09 17:30:49 OIL IS MORE OR LESS.
2979 2018-07-09 17:30:46 Blend 11 lbs banana with 2 1/2 pints chard. Mix in Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve
2980 2018-07-09 17:30:38 Some flaming hot oil splashed into my eye and i was partially blind for like 10 minutes, how was your day?

2984 2018-07-09 17:30:24 Gotta be careful with castor oil cause it’ll just makes you use he bathroom and not have her come  only thing to do is sex most of that shit doesn’t work anyway
2985 2018-07-09 17:30:18 I quit buying Exxon when the Valdez dumped oil in Alaska. That company sucks.
2986 2018-07-09 17:30:07 14 years of socialist government, Venezuela – the country with the world’s largest oil reserves – is currently importing gasoline. This fact highlights Venezuela’s painful descent into chaos, as the economy crumbles and the nation’s social fabric unravels. They don't!!!!!
2987 2018-07-09 17:30:06 Cristyan pretty much only uses his oil pen to smoke now, but I literally cannot get with the idea of not having a joint or bowl. 
2988 2018-07-09 17:29:51 Even Keynes recognized fiscal responsibility. That which is borrowed must be paid. He didn't advocate for borrowing on massive debt. Stimulative spending in time of crisis diff than relying on it perpetually
2989 2018-07-09 17:29:47 Why r we making roads n rail n selling oil n minerals to foreigners, when we can make same for use by our people, n use the resources to supply our people? Why African focus is outward first, instead of inward first?
2990 2018-07-09 17:29:38 今見てもカッコいいというか、古臭さを感じさせないのが凄いと思います
2991 2018-07-09 17:29:35 For fun you should do a back story on the hiring of janitorial staff.   “From time to time you’ll see lots of blood on the walls. No rush cleaning that. And those rusty oil drums?  Yeah just leave them anywhere. “
2992 2018-07-09 17:29:35 Agree. It is humiliating.
Palm Oil is very cheap as compared to mustard & other edible oil, so it is mixed in these to earn huge profits.
Sir, but why India consistently fails to reign in even tiny Countries around us? Do we need to exert some hard power?
2993 2018-07-09 17:29:30 The government painted s pretty picture after wards. Treaties were made. Mostly all broken. Still going on today. Trying to get rid of all treaties. They put natives on worthless land. Now there's oil, resource on the worthless land. Pruitt gave approval for oil Co. Greed!!
2994 2018-07-09 17:29:14 At independence, oil constituted a huge percentage of the government’s revenue; South Sudan is the most oil-dependent country in the world, with oil accounting for almost the totality of exports, and around 60% of its gross domestic product (GDP)

2996 2018-07-09 17:28:58 It's not 'normally' that bad, but around the lochs and Isles, humidity and still water... They don't like the wind or strong Sun, bog myrtle oil is great as Nordic Summer, smoked pine sap, makes you stink gloriously of woodsmoke (I get jealous looks on the tube) 
2997 2018-07-09 17:28:46 Yo  change they damn oil
2998 2018-07-09 17:28:41 Feelings and justice go together like oil and water.

We need logic back in control of this nation.
We need results to matter. Not "feel good" motivations that garner nothing but disaster.

It's time to build a new treehouse, and make the emotional thinkers stay away.
2999 2018-07-09 17:28:40 pake virgin coconut oil ga? katanya bisa aja tanpa itu tp ga maksimal dan lemes. yg aku rasa di hari ke 7 itu sih. mau start mikir lagi hahaha

3001 2018-07-09 17:27:58 I had that same issue last year! The front right blew twice within the span of an oil change cycle. It was an absolute aggravation and a huge inconvenience.
3002 2018-07-09 17:27:40 some girls bottoms cane pretty low while putting on tanning oil at the beach, sam and I having this view... sam looks at me and goes “I’m fucking eating” with such disgust on her face

3004 2018-07-09 17:27:19 I think we usually use sesame oil. If you don't have that I'd probably use the coconut oil. 
3005 2018-07-09 17:27:18 Start the day with @DrGundry ‘s chocolate pudding:  leafy greens, Heart Defense, Vital Reds, Primal Greens, Marine Collagen, mint, rosemary, one avocado (for thickening), lemon juice, H2O, ice.  Blend, pour & stir in your choice of olive oil, perilla oil, MCT oil, etc.  Enjoy!

3022 2018-07-09 17:25:54 This design has been around for a long time and I have seen organizations and companies testing them for years. The reason there may be a hold up is interference from oil companies and cartels.
3023 2018-07-09 17:25:54 8. Spray/ put some nice scented oils such as lavender oil on your pillow and around the house . This will help you get a good nights sleep and help you to relax .
3024 2018-07-09 17:25:51 Either way, a unilateral threat against Iran is not the way to bring about change esp when the alternative is to import more Saudi oil (ie far bigger terror sponsors than Iran).

3029 2018-07-09 17:25:18 I am looking forward to the many different types of analysis on this calendar, thanks. One wonders if any notes, audiotapes, or records of any other kinds, were taken at the meets with oil and gas reps.

@HlomlaDandala Our "real" petrol price is about R 7.60; the reest goes to levies etc. So, it is the Government that takes most of the money, not neccessarily oil and ollar/rand exchange.

3038 2018-07-09 17:23:44 And I read that to be pure speculation, since I don't have access to $ site.   And the SPR is no longer needed.  Oil industry complained couple years ago when they were releasing SPR with oil in 40's,  and rightfully so.   It was done then just for govt revenue.

3042 2018-07-09 17:23:29 A slight clarification: I never embraced malthusian ideas as a result of the exposure to peak oil/deep ecology stuff. I knew they were wrong, but couldnt find good, thorough critiques of it so I had to kind of stumble along in refuting them.

3052 2018-07-09 17:22:16 Ive has the soft tofu fried up in olive oil with some bell peppers, water chestnuts and snap peas. Oh my god it was SO good. The tofu was crunchy on the outside, buttery & silky on the inside, plus it was doused in some spicy sauce. Was seriously so good
3053 2018-07-09 17:22:15 Bref, j'ai l'impression que vos a priori vous empêchent d'imaginer un autre avenir que la pure continuation de notre présent. Lorsque le peak oil et les +2 degrés auront fait leurs effets, nous devrons bien accepter de changer. L'AEC anticipe la catastrophe. Macron la précipite.

3089 2018-07-09 17:18:02 But they employ armies of accountants, tax lawyers to find every deduction possible, same as you. None just cut an extra check to treasury. It's all meaningless rhetoric to promote political agendas. Most know it

3096 2018-07-09 17:16:41 If you get acne or pimples put tea tree oil on it (can be bought from any pharmacy area). After washing your face and putting on moisturizer use the tea tree oil as a spot treatment, it's antibacterial and will sort of shrink it down overnight. And it smells good too
3097 2018-07-09 17:16:28 Why don't you talk shit about oil as well while you are at it?  Oil prices are too high blah blah.  Saudi and Russia should be ashamed blah blah.  Do it!!  tweet it
3098 2018-07-09 17:16:27 So oil prices went down. Not predicated by anyone. Oil prices are back up again. You didn't notice? Or you are just blanking it out?
3099 2018-07-09 17:16:26 People also ask

Where are the tar sands?
What is the difference between tar sands and oil shale?

3158 2018-07-09 17:08:07 IEA uses past demand trends to model future demand. This study uses technology diffusion modeling, arguably a better approach. I do think their marginal cost analysis doesn’t capture oilsands correctly, but even half this would be a disaster for  oil.
3159 2018-07-09 17:07:59 Haha bros... Palm oil business kuma?  
3160 2018-07-09 17:07:57 & so they should. proud unionist Scots must be dismayed at behaviour of London centric HP. They could be as conservative or as socialist as they want n independent Scotland. A country rebuilding frm oil dependency dot need London its needs Brussels! The union is scotlands anchor
3161 2018-07-09 17:07:57 Much needed oil change b4 I start Lyfting.. – bij Jiffy Lube
3162 2018-07-09 17:07:52 One time my dad refused to get into an Uber that was a Prius because “they’re the reason the oil industry is in trouble” 
3163 2018-07-09 17:07:51 As a licensed professional, I will say yes... Abrasives such as baking soda work. However, it will also slowly strip your color if it's not virgin hair. Secondly, it is extremely important to condition the hair. Coconut oil only coats it, it does not close the cuticle layer.
3164 2018-07-09 17:07:20 What are the advantages?
3165 2018-07-09 17:07:01 she is a pure drop of water in an oil ridden sea
3166 2018-07-09 17:06:55 #PSG already ready to offer @FCBarcelona $270m for Coutinho?  If true, I think we should sell the whole squad along with the stadium, the city and the fans to them. Looks like they can’t exist without #Barça. Oil won’t buy you Champions League, losers.
3167 2018-07-09 17:06:53 Then how come your puppet Mohammad lived 1400yrs ago without oil ?
3168 2018-07-09 17:06:48 I honestly don’t understand how it takes so long for an oil change..
3169 2018-07-09 17:06:43 if this is greasy then I'm a fucking oil slicc don't tell trumpo he be sending the marines after me 
3170 2018-07-09 17:06:33 At least the rich can spearhead something worthwhile, instead of putting their $$ into oil and gas
3171 2018-07-09 17:06:28 Drizzled with right amount of olive oil and with a glass of chilled cava it tastes heavenly 
3172 2018-07-09 17:06:14 A sharp increase in social media posts about people in Iran being jailed or beaten whom we know nothing about. Why? 
Because America wants its oil. 
3173 2018-07-09 17:06:10 Got my cars oil changed , cleaned out my makeup case & my fridge is full . I feel so responsible 
3174 2018-07-09 17:06:06 1940s - Five Sisters bing is established in Addiewell - the waste from the oil shale process used to meet demand for oil during the war.
3175 2018-07-09 17:05:51 Why stop here, you should also indicate he will roll back O2 from air, oil from Mc fries, tattoos from sagging skin and snow from the rockies.
3176 2018-07-09 17:05:25 With all the gas & oil exploration going on, the sawmills are packed & most are paying record low prices if they're buying at all. Supply & demand. Very bad time to be in the timber business.
Here is an idea to create money for WV.... pay ur taxes @WVGovernor
3177 2018-07-09 17:05:23 I wish Oil City was around
3178 2018-07-09 17:05:23 Why oil short?
3179 2018-07-09 17:05:19 Who can change my oil like literally this isn’t a euphemism
3180 2018-07-09 17:04:39 They protect US oil interests. I get that. It’s just a bad situation all around. What did those founders say about entangling alliances?  Stay out of them!  US warships shouldn’t “protect” big corporations’ business interests. Waste of tax payer $$. But the Corp empire for ya.
3181 2018-07-09 17:04:30 Yeah the trash ol #lyingmike spews out his mouth constantly. Or his twitter feed he loves to use. Probably on his phone or computer all brought to you by oil

3183 2018-07-09 17:04:18 Pretty sure Acosta is a citizen. You mean you’ll “exile” him. Sounds cooler anyway.
3184 2018-07-09 17:04:17 My revision would be to nuke Acosta while he’s in Portland and send Lenny to Gitmo
3185 2018-07-09 17:04:09 Did you know that the camera cases need to be filled with oil, not air, so they don't implode? Really squishy down there.
3186 2018-07-09 17:04:09 Tea tree oil helps, numbs the mouth. It tastes foul, though, so some children wouldn't tolerate it at all.
3187 2018-07-09 17:04:07 The only reason Palm oil is used is because it's cheap and I mean really cheap compared to other edible oils.
3188 2018-07-09 17:04:01 Then again, forget the hat, use baby oil instead
3189 2018-07-09 17:03:44 Anyone else notice your smile not quite as bright due to all the coffee? Orange essential oil has been an amazing natural solution for me! #essentialoils #teethwhitening #naturalhealth
3190 2018-07-09 17:03:38 Coconut oil when heated to skin temperature has a slick consistency that can act as an all natural moisturizing lubricant.

3197 2018-07-09 17:02:54 I’m looking at a blueberry muffin recipe. Person replaced all the sugar with honey, flour with oat flour, oil with apple sauce and then gave it a 1-Star rating. 
3198 2018-07-09 17:02:51 was cooking bacon and as i was flipping them over a bunch of oil jumped on my legs... happy monday! 
3199 2018-07-09 17:02:50 Coconut oil soothes butt pain obviously
3200 2018-07-09 17:02:48 Im at firestone getting my oil changed and a mechanic comes in and 

Him: are you in the neon?

Me: yes

Him: why do you have a pickle with a face on the back of your car?!

Me and the clerk: ThAtS PiCKLe RiCk!!!! 

Him: oh from rick and morty?? Ive only seen like 3 episodes
3201 2018-07-09 17:02:36 BIO OIL IS LIFE
3202 2018-07-09 17:02:30 My dads obviously into the essential oils because he just forced me to put some stress relief and energy oil on my wrist then puts it on my head.
3203 2018-07-09 17:02:28 Connors been thinking of working on an oil rig and it makes me sick to my stomach knowing I won’t see him for 2 weeks at a time. And that he’ll be doing such dangerous work But so blessed he’s wanting to work hard and make a living for us 
3204 2018-07-09 17:02:26 ありがとうこざいます。
3205 2018-07-09 17:02:24 With less swim wear and baby oil. For the time being...
3206 2018-07-09 17:02:23 Really ru fucking kidding me? There is no world without oil. Ur just 15% of the world population. Ur livng in the world of christians and muslims.
3207 2018-07-09 17:02:20 Regardless of the “sciency” sound of the ingredients, that seems like a long list for something that can be made with flour, water, sugar, fat (I’d use butter, but I’m not vegan) yeast, salt and frying oil.

I know what some of those are and absolutely do not use them

3211 2018-07-09 17:01:27 Hi Yop ..
Im an Australian too .

Yes , and am setting up to walk the 'Way '
Same route as you and James are waking .
Great to see you doing so well , I'm the one who suggested coconut oil for your hair long ago when you were in ?
oh some eastern county .
Looking good 
3212 2018-07-09 17:01:23 First For Honor. Now, coconut oil. 

You really need to start consulting.
3213 2018-07-09 17:01:17 If anyone can, Trump can. Remember that 1) Putin must have high oil prices, and 2) a MidEast war increases armament sales, Russia’s other big hard currency earner. Could it be that Russia will for now get to keep winnings to date but Iran’s will be sacrificed? Oil will go higher.
3214 2018-07-09 17:01:12 The incentive to replace fleet vehicles is the much lower fuel and maintenance costs. Incentive for infrastructure is already heating up with oil companies getting into the charging market, and they will eventually compete directly with utilities.
3215 2018-07-09 17:01:11 Unemployment and Inflation were correlated in the 1970s because they were driven by a supply shock: a huge jump in the price of oil.

3219 2018-07-09 17:00:58 No thx to you.  Don’t forget to thank the rising price of oil, you know the resriuce you hate and the industry you punish?

3226 2018-07-09 17:00:24 Hi Rachel, we work with environmental NGOs who aren’t in favour of a boycott on palm oil. Instead, long term sustainability will only be achieved by working together. When it comes to cost, we actually pay a premium for sustainable palm oil.
3227 2018-07-09 17:00:22 Especially the rez. Oil money divided us .Now we have the "Haves" and "Have-nots".Band offices keeps us divided!Who you know now.
3228 2018-07-09 17:00:21 Yeah that's where I first got into him as well. What's crazy is his background. The dude worked in the oil fields in Northern Alberta (not 5 hours north of where I'm sitting now) and now he's a intellectual juggernaut.
3229 2018-07-09 17:00:03 Food for thought:

3232 2018-07-09 16:59:38 Never bringing my car for an oil change again. They always take forever  need to quit being lazy and do it myself.
3233 2018-07-09 16:59:31 alright so i use the biotin and collagen shampoo and conditioner from ogx and i use the jamaican black castor oil from shea moisture. honestly just wanted to get rid of the castor oil shampoo and conditioner so i combined them and now my hair is in peak condition
3234 2018-07-09 16:59:17 So only Republicans are connected to Big Oil?? I guess Democrats are only tied to puppies and baby seals, ya know all the nice cute stuff.
3235 2018-07-09 16:59:11 ohhh i want this very bad. a transformer cooling oil analyst, a steeplejack, a snake milker, and a chicken sexer go on a journey to kill god
3236 2018-07-09 16:59:00 I believe that was due to the type of oil used when new. If they'd gone for a different oil spec and had the first change at a sensible interval rather than 20k miles, they'd have bedded in correctly.
3237 2018-07-09 16:58:47 @realDonaldTrump China is the dirtiest country in the world, we welcome tariffs against China, I want to send a clear message to China. Only until November. Since November 4, if you buy a barrel of oil, then you will see what terrible sanctions will be imposed on you.
3238 2018-07-09 16:58:44 Who said oil & gas not taxed? The question is, “What tax breaks and subsidies do they receive?” that others do not receive?
3239 2018-07-09 16:58:42 In Russia, Latin American country's and some parts of oceans have oil deposits we can get from them.
Moreover oil resources in your holy LAnd will be empty in future.
And you should realise that without oil everyone can live but can you live without food and water? That's ur IQ
3240 2018-07-09 16:58:35 Isis is welcome amongst the UK and the US. They fund them abroad and let them back in when they've been doing the wests bidding. Even Turkey was buying ISIS oil

3244 2018-07-09 16:57:48 You hate the EU but still want a 'special' deal with them after your country leaves, why? 
Scared of leaving with a hard Brexit?

Scotland has a £5Bn+ trade surplus without her oil and gas. Tories have created £1Tr+ UK debt.

You live in England so why care what Scotland does?

3249 2018-07-09 16:56:54 IP is not going to factor into tonight’s decision on new SCOTUS justice but if we get another critic of Chevron deference then it will surely encourage another constitutional challenge to the PTAB a la Oil States. A new justice could give the Gorsuch/Roberts axis a 3rd vote
3250 2018-07-09 16:56:50 Anyone noticed recently that the oil prices were hiked just as the oil from turkana started being transported, what an irony. What pains me and some other guys i've been talking to is that the oil was discovered about 7yrs ago yet GoK plans to export it.@Kalasinga_ @OwuorMichael
3251 2018-07-09 16:56:50 @AlexCobb_ remember XRP is a good bridge for remittances in low volume corridors but XRP is better over the ILP for all assets.. BTC for fiat , oil for fiat , corn for euro etc.. Xraipd is a tool for the bigger plan. #allpayments for x broader or cross asset. #IOV via #ILP

3257 2018-07-09 16:56:12 - For longer lashes apply coconut oil or vaseline on them every night

- Use almond oil as moisturizer for a natural glow (not too much or it will clog your pores)
3258 2018-07-09 16:56:02 Nothing surprises me anymore. The fact that a lifetime politician snake oil salesman like you represents me (not really) in the Senate, for example. You and Gillibrand embarrass me as a New Yorker.

If you want thick brows apply castor  oil on them every night.

- Take care of your skin
Wash your face 2 times a day and drink water (I know you're tired of hearing that but it does help)
3271 2018-07-09 16:54:34 No but really. Works so much better than coconut oil.

納豆は語呂合わせ、オイルは英語で「OIL」これを回転させると「710」に見えるからよ。

「ボク、ナットウマンです」とか「そう、私こそがオイルマン」とか居ないのかしら。
そうすれば楽なんだけど。
3296 2018-07-09 16:52:11 Do you realize the oil industry pumps xylene, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and all sorts of chemicals which don't make a fracture? What exactly is the big deal if the rock is fractured? The industry has been fracturing rocks on purpose over 60 years.

Yes, there r other countries exporting palm oil, just switch buyer. Either our commerce/defense/EAM/ministers work in compartments r the bureaucrats in respective ministries don't put up any actionable agenda before PM, cabinet r concerned ministers.

3311 2018-07-09 16:50:25 The cost of oil extraction is massive and spills cost billions of dollars. Not worth it

3333 2018-07-09 16:48:09 that is what you wrote, they (wnba) aren't putting out an entertaining product. The product they're "putting out" Is the game of basketball, genius. So that's exactly what you wrote. What do they have to do in your mind? Play in bikinis' oil & mud to entertain the likes of you?
3334 2018-07-09 16:48:01 I was this shiny last weekend shooting an outdoor wedding, and my skin felt like I had put baby oil on. That's a natural glow I bet!

3348 2018-07-09 16:46:26 @Applebees how could you possibly justify frying potatoes in the same oil as dead animals to a vegetarian? No other chain does this to their customers.  You expose customers to bacteria from dead animal flesh putting beef, chicken/fish in the same oil as your potatotes. STOP IT!
3349 2018-07-09 16:46:01 But Nahh man my cousin can’t either. He literally gets burned when holy water or oil touches him and it like burns him burns him and leaves marks on him and everything

Like castor oil, trade tariffs taste bad in the beginning, but it cleans out the bad stuff quickly! If you're tasting castor oil now, well?
3354 2018-07-09 16:45:49 I just need some tires lord, i just wanna get a oil change lord, i also need some gas lord cause my gas light is on looking at me look at it lord...but lord why must it be so hot ???
3355 2018-07-09 16:45:36 Damn, thought I got out of the managers retreat this year but I guess not. At least it's in Oregon this year so I'm bringing an oil pen. Not that I didn't when it was in Georgia but now I'm not gonna hide it.
3356 2018-07-09 16:45:35 Why grow another acre of soy or rapeseed for oil, when we can use the tallow from the cows already being slaughtered? We abandoned tallow for cooking for mistaken reasons. @McDonalds became famous for its French fries, not its burgers. & those fries were cooked in #tallow. /x

3360 2018-07-09 16:45:31 Murphy didn’t end the tax mandate and increase the oil prices. If you make more than 5 million or more a year you will see an increase in your taxes because of Murphy.

3366 2018-07-09 16:44:40 Apparently it’s been identified as a oil beetle 
3367 2018-07-09 16:44:33 Science is not always 100% correct, that is why we make correction. That is why gravity is still a theory. Saying "because science couldn't predict how much oil was in the ground means we should continue to use oil" is a ludicrous idea. We have better models now, than we did then

3373 2018-07-09 16:43:52 Well, they've been selling SPR oil for a couple years now, that's not a big deal.   And frankly, I've not heard much about the threat.   I don't think producers want to see higher oil prices, as counter intuitive as that may be.   Higher prices = crash on the other side.

3384 2018-07-09 16:41:58 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
3385 2018-07-09 16:41:56 A girl went in for a an oil change and now I’m spending way too much money 
3386 2018-07-09 16:41:53 I don't expect there'll be a non-Republican president, but my point was if there were it will now be difficult for conservatives & oil industry to oppose on free-market principles a release of SPR, threats to OPEC states, or other actions designed to lower oil prices post-#Trump.

3389 2018-07-09 16:41:30 Yes @Digbylj we pay for it with the revenues & taxes we generate from their oil! Ungrateful so-and-so!
3390 2018-07-09 16:41:02 Yes, and spreading it thin while hot, is quite a task, even with oil smeared hands! The rolling bit is the most enjoyable. My mother used to love the home made ones so while she was with us, I used to make them for her. Stopped after she passed away 3 years ago.

3406 2018-07-09 16:39:19 I'm not sure what you're talking about. Venezuela is more like state capitalism than socialism, but even then they've achieved a lot. If they didn't have to worry about US intervention they'd be doing much better. Their big problem is only one thing: their economy is based on oil

3408 2018-07-09 16:39:15 @FIATUSA My #Abarth is eating 2 quarts of oil every 800 miles. I was told by the deal that there was no leak. Something is very wrong with my car.
3409 2018-07-09 16:39:07 A BMW engineer once told me - ‘modern engines don’t need running in, just warm the oil and absolutely nail it from new ! Any INFORMED opinion on that one ? #stayawayfromforums #canofworms

3411 2018-07-09 16:38:30 Hitler was expanding the markets and the power of German capitalism by incorporating ethnic Germans --and others too, plus industries and raw materials too.(eg oil). Racialism was a convenient disguise for that.

3423 2018-07-09 16:37:07 I get that. Although "primary" lighting source was smelly/smoky compared to beeswax & whale oil, which rich people used. Nobody's bringing back suet pudding either, which I made for my dad every year when he was alive and the rancher I bought from had never heard of it.

3432 2018-07-09 16:35:30 The enduring accomplishment of tight oil/shale gas propaganda is that people actually believe that production volume is a measure of economic success. It doesn't matter how much Tier 1 vs 2 produces (whatever those terms mean anyway). What matters is, Does anyone make money?

3451 2018-07-09 16:34:02 No, I'm not saying a president's concern about gasoline price is bad or good. I'm saying that in past overt threats to OPEC (esp tied to defense) or threats to release SPR or other policies to lower nearby oil prices would've been questioned as be govt interference in markets.
3452 2018-07-09 16:34:01 in that oil, it isn't vegetarian any more. Restaurants should make that clear. Only 40% of a cow makes it to the plate. If you're going to be eating hamburgers and steaks anyway, you should be cooking with tallow (which is 12% of a cow). /x
3453 2018-07-09 16:33:36 Crucial if we are to help retain experienced staff - why should you have to apply for a new role to get a pay rise- oil companies have the same people working for 20 yrs in the same role - tacit knowledge balanced with expertise @alisonleary1

Regular maintenance such as tune-ups, oil changes, battery checks, and tire rotations go a long way toward preventing breakdowns. If your vehicle has been serviced according to the manufacturer's recommendations, it should be in good condition to travel.

3565 2018-07-09 16:21:32 Very much so. Many states in Malaysia as well. They run the states mostly as business. Anything they make is for the state. The entire KFC franchise in Malaysia is owned by one of the states. Same for some palm oil plantations. So a state can own a business in another diff state
3566 2018-07-09 16:21:27 Up early to get this oil change
3567 2018-07-09 16:21:22 Are you the deramper Ilon LSE Solo bn ? Go away. SS will send out tankers when he is ready . Or he will store it for a while . Now oil being the price it is I'm guessing not long for tankers rolling..
3568 2018-07-09 16:21:15 i think you are confused.  Abdi Iley was fired this week under Abiy Ahmed.  he has a militia, a lot of weapons, lots of time due to unemployment, and now a grudge.   Oil production in Ogaden may now be a target. (as we have seen it was attacked in 2007)

3575 2018-07-09 16:20:23 I use the daily cleanser twice a day, (the oil cleanser to remove heavy makeup), the toner, then the hyaluronic serum, day or night creme. Lactic serum once a week. Pumpkin masque once a week.
3576 2018-07-09 16:20:19 The oil is basically the only thing that helps with the disorder I have. And sorry but if you have to choose between morphine or weed oil, weed oil is a lot better for you
3577 2018-07-09 16:20:11 No matter how many people try to copy you, do what you do, "brand" like you etc. It won't work for them because they dont have the same oil! If you ain't got no oil you ain't goin no where! #theAnointing makes the difference

3585 2018-07-09 16:19:38 I wish someone would hurry up and do a study with CBD oil and the brain. As well as CBD oil with cancers... Or maybe we should wait until farmers have full crops planted first so the red tape wont be plastered.. 
3586 2018-07-09 16:19:36 Stop making wars about oil
3587 2018-07-09 16:19:34 I’m not saying you’re unattractive, I’m just saying you need your oil changed

3590 2018-07-09 16:19:27 Mama was dying—Alzheimer’s & Parkinson’s. Hospice minister read last rights & anointed the oil. One, 2, 4, 6 days on the precipice. On the 7th night we put her church keys (she was caretaker) in her hand & opened the front door. Her spirit literally went through us as she left.

3592 2018-07-09 16:19:12 Is there a such thing as too much moisture? Between spritzing rose water toner, and adding an oil drop to my moisturizer I’m trying to see if I’m hurting rather than hurting.
3593 2018-07-09 16:19:11 ? Its not like you chew the oil is it?

3597 2018-07-09 16:18:57 yeah!! like there’s an oil they make for kids with cp and whatnot but also it helps with anxiety and is a healthier alternative than cigarettes for people with asthma
3598 2018-07-09 16:18:56 あと本のoilペンでそのままガシガシ塗っちゃうとベタッとした見た目が悪く見えるからもうちょっと筆圧低めにしてレイヤー効果で影を乗算とかライティングをオーバーレイで塗ると画面の綺麗さが上がる

3601 2018-07-09 16:18:37 Because Muslim countries are flourishing on oil reserves soon they will expire.. The so called powerful Muslim countries have realised and diversifying form extremism to realism take example of uae..they are utilising begger countries like Pakistan

3607 2018-07-09 16:18:06 @thankyourbody hi!!  Do you know if algae oil is healthy for you?  Would love to know where it falls on your list of oils to avoid!
3608 2018-07-09 16:18:03 Nah it’s oil
3609 2018-07-09 16:18:02 I wish when I went to get my oil changed I knew wtf I was doing

3611 2018-07-09 16:17:40 "เอาๆ" พยักหน้าหงึกหงัก ชะเง้อคอมองจุดขายป็อปคอร์นที่อยู่ข้างๆ พอดี "เอาหวานกับชีสรวมกัน มึงช่วยกินด้วยนะ.."

ไม่ทันได้ฟังคำตอบก็หันไปสั่งเสียเรียบร้อย รู้ตัวอีกทีก็ได้ป๊อปคอร์นและน้ำโค้กมาอยู่ในมือ

3614 2018-07-09 16:17:30 It has reached about R11 when the oil price peaked
3615 2018-07-09 16:17:29 To me it seems burning sage to clear your aura and personal space is the same thing as when people use anointing oil to pray for protection over their homes.
3616 2018-07-09 16:17:23 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

3618 2018-07-09 16:17:16 Positive changes in social belief & practise was result of what Cathy did. I watched TV knowing the world was watching and analysing meaning. A special moment for the 1st peoples which was sweetened a little by Midnight Oil at the closing ceremony. Happy NAIDOC week Wayne B

3626 2018-07-09 16:16:31 You also saved over the years on not needing oil changes & other things, but spending yes these are expensive vehicles to buy and to maintain, as like all premium vehicles, replacing & repairing items that fail cost a lot. I use my electric bicycle to save money on my commute!
3627 2018-07-09 16:16:30 If you are upset about people getting "free" health care, but not billions in subsidies being poured into profitable oil companies, you're a bad person and can fuck right off
3628 2018-07-09 16:16:22 Pedih teruk pakai aiken punye tea tree oil ni..
3629 2018-07-09 16:16:21 So you support raising taxes to cover the oil crash shortfall in revenue? Or do you believe the past government was spending too much on services?
3630 2018-07-09 16:16:20 Lies, Fox talking points. @RockyMtnInst and others have analyzed the full lifecycle, including materials and disposal. Far, far more efficient than oil, gas, or anything else. Been mentioned plenty.

3638 2018-07-09 16:15:20 Plant oil as fuel may seem insignificant but in time become just as important as kerosene & coal-tar-products of today Rudolf Diesel
3639 2018-07-09 16:15:18 Look forward to it. But I want the first oil tanker pic  so it's still friendly composition!!  So youde  better be on you're toes !!
3640 2018-07-09 16:15:07 My daughter Gwen uses cannabis oil primarily for epilepsy. That said, she is also autistic and with proper therapy and CBD we have seen great improvement in her.
3641 2018-07-09 16:15:06 I used st ives facial scrub with aveno cream for a while to help my face out and teatree oil to heal the outbreaks. Then the aveno in the morning and olay cc cream on top and that has been keeping me good

3648 2018-07-09 16:14:09 Oil Prices rose on as increased global demand and U.S. efforts to shut out Iranian output through the use of sanctions outweighed drilling data suggesting that U.S. shale production would climb

3650 2018-07-09 16:13:54 Paula Volsky always wrote a lot about food in her books (Illusion/The Grand Ellipse among others - sadly often out of print!)  Off the top of my head I seem to remember a lot of "pickled lorbers" and "chili oil eels" or similar.

3659 2018-07-09 16:13:01 I’m gonna be productive today, oil change, clean house and maybe start on the backyard
3660 2018-07-09 16:12:58 This is just one example.  But I would like to know why Obama allowed US oil rights in NE Utah go to Enefit.  They claim how they slowed or stopped drilling in the US but all the while giving our own oil away to an Estonian company????  That's just 1 example.

3666 2018-07-09 16:12:34 Who wanna lay out in the sun drenched in oil with a cold tea and perhaps a blunt?? Just me??? Ok
3667 2018-07-09 16:12:34 2-Also it would strongly affect the oil market and increase the price of oil which never was a good development for Europe or USA.3- it might convince Iran to do what ever it can with It’s proxies in order to Undermine U.S.
3668 2018-07-09 16:12:14 guess ima just go get my oil changed myself

3682 2018-07-09 16:10:24 I used to get chronic sinus infections & would be on different antibiotics. Once I switched to drops of oil of oregano I almost never get them now.I take it at the first hint.
It tastes awful,but you get used to it,I know other people who have gone this route with great success.
3683 2018-07-09 16:10:08 Donnie and his family are in like Flynn with the Saudi’s, and Qatar... But then again after 9/11 bush invaded Iraq, which also didn’t have anything to do with  9/11, but had oil...

3702 2018-07-09 16:07:56 China will receive crude oil at a discount as the regime is desperate to sell to anyone, in exchange they'll give the regime cheaply made goods at a high price which results in factory closures. With/without sanctions, Iranians are the main losers under this regime.

3835 2018-07-09 15:56:36 @renault_uk what is the service schedule for a 2017 megane. Registered 31/3/2017. Oil change at 6000mls. Now 16000 mls with no further service.. Is warranty invalid?
3836 2018-07-09 15:56:31 Do the windmills use any kind of oil based products at all?

3840 2018-07-09 15:56:13 Ive never had too much of an issue with bugs so im not the most well versed in dealing with them but ive heard that a garlic oil spray works pretty well. Its just 3 or 4 minced cloves of garlic which you let sit in 2 tsp of mineral oil over night before straining out the garlic/1
3841 2018-07-09 15:56:11 if i wasn’t being such an indecisive person, putting on facemask would have been ideal. I MEAN HOW CAN I CHOOSE BETWEEN BRIGHTENING, REFRESHING, ENERGISING, RADIANT, ANTIOXIDANTS, OIL CONTROL AND PORE TIGHTENING
3842 2018-07-09 15:56:06 I really hate to go get an oil change like, they always come tell me what I already know and STILL not about to pay for...
3843 2018-07-09 15:55:46 Renewable energy is everywhere though, damns wind farms solar arrays but until we have a globally sustainable self sufficient system it’s hard to get rid of things like oil, it’s hard to power a car with wind energy or water energy, not to mention solar and do it effectively

3846 2018-07-09 15:55:30 The sad part is that it is being done openly, right in front of us all.

Its daylight robbery I tell you. If this is the way to go to solve poverty or ameliorate its effects on Nigeria why don't we just share crude oil proceeds to everyone?

The idea is utterly foolish!!

3893 2018-07-09 15:51:13 We gotcha Mr. Dollar. All woes are attributable to Obama. You didn't address how you feel about Republican, pro-oil industry, anti climate science Trump's market interference, demanding OPEC pump more oil. That was what my tweet was about. I wasn't defending Obama. He's gone.
3894 2018-07-09 15:51:02 Retweeted Anthony Fenton (@anthonyfenton):

By record-setting, that's the single-highest month of exports to Saudi Arabia in the available 21 years of @StatCan_eng data. It was even a rare month when exports exceeded imports (of Saudi oil).
3895 2018-07-09 15:51:02 Yes. I can't agree less because if you divide 2million barrel of crude oil value by 160million Nigerians. U get chicken change of money which is less than $300/person/annum. Knowing that exploration companies get 40% of the income also
3896 2018-07-09 15:50:55 What they all said! Butter, ghee, tallow, lard, bacon grease, rendered duck fat, olive oil, and avocado oil.. I'll just add when using lard, bacon grease, and duck fat - source matters because if they're fed a diet high in Omega 6 PUFAs it'll bioaccumulate into their fat
3897 2018-07-09 15:50:54 That meme of mentioning oil and then US soldiers everywhere except instead of ‘oil’ it’s ‘breastfeeding’.
3898 2018-07-09 15:50:50 Ah. Heating oil is not something we have here. Are new homes in your area still built to be heated this way?
3899 2018-07-09 15:50:44 Well yes they have. The oil was for the people. Now it is for the narco regime to buy shoes from Valentino for 700 dolars.

3918 2018-07-09 15:48:49 Pretty easy for Trump to come up with subsidies, they don't come out of his pocket, but ours, the taxpayers. Why we subsidize the ciggy industry that is blamed for lung cancer is beyond me. Oil companies that report record profits as well.
3919 2018-07-09 15:48:36 Up until recently, homogenous populations. Norway floating on a sea of black oil. Denmark consciously accepting lower standard of living. US paying Western world’s defense costs. Sweden currently going to Hell in a hand basket.

3928 2018-07-09 15:47:49 part of it is about drying out the surface of the meat, so that the oil can be more effective; it also helps when you cook meat from room temperature (rather than straight out of the fridge) so that it can cook as fast as possible…
3929 2018-07-09 15:47:45 I have pretty good idea . Such as Venezuelan oil. In middle east we know that ; US will do everything to get oil. So I thought this is same thing.

3933 2018-07-09 15:47:15 In 2008, when the the price of oil per barrel was $140, the price of petrol per liter was about R10,40. Today the price of oil per barrel is just under $80 and we’re paying R16 per liter.

If these allies are that afraid of Russia why are they buying more from them to a point of energy dependency?

3969 2018-07-09 15:44:18 Trump has increased US oil production bombed Syria sold weapons to the Ukraine and Poland so he’s giving countries the power to defend themselves.  And if the EU was so worried about Russia wouldn’t they be funding NATO.
3970 2018-07-09 15:44:16 What environmental standards have they applied would like to know.  They have not met any of their climate goals. All they’ve done is made themselves dependent on Russian oil.  Putin’s economy is broke.  It’s china who are wanting to overtake the world
3971 2018-07-09 15:44:13 Game changer for US oil $PQEFF could be a $10 stock within six months on that news.
3972 2018-07-09 15:44:06 haven’t cried in months so I had a nice break down of happy/sad/stress crying at the mechanic today while getting my oil changed :))))

3974 2018-07-09 15:44:02 Agree.  He really screwed Putin on oil prices.  It was brilliant.  Russia had calculated it's budget on 100 a barrel.  It went down to 40.  Putin was not a happy camper.
3975 2018-07-09 15:43:59 @NestleWatersNA How about capturing some of the 6 billion gallons of meltwater from Antarctica in repurposed oil tankers and transporting to anywhere in the world that fresh water is needed? #idea #fresh #Antarctica #WaterCrisis
3976 2018-07-09 15:43:56 Many of his supporters think that he knows what he is doing.  They’ve been scammed by the king of scammers.  Trump is the most successful snake oil salesman ever.
3977 2018-07-09 15:43:52 These girls I work with don’t know how to check the oil in their car..... AND they didn’t know their spare tire was under your trunk... I hate everyone 
3978 2018-07-09 15:43:38 I got all these guy friends but can’t nobody change my oil  USELESS

3981 2018-07-09 15:43:20 In 2008, when the the price of oil per barrel was $140, the price of petrol per liter was about R10,40. Today the price of oil per barrel is just under $80 and we’re paying R16 per liter. 
3982 2018-07-09 15:43:09 Yeah, and stuff haha. You forgot to mention cheese and olive oil
3983 2018-07-09 15:43:05 I wish I could say cost is why I won't do this...

but realistically I don't trust that any reasonable human would put enough of the disgusting fake butter oil on it to really recreate my perfect movie popcorn experience.

3985 2018-07-09 15:42:54 Trumpism is like an oil spill. Use whatever will work.
3986 2018-07-09 15:42:53 Yea, we found more. But oil is still finite resource, and fracking isn't exactly the safest method of extraction. Not to mention the continued use of oil is destroying our planet.

3988 2018-07-09 15:42:51 Gonna guess the last time crude oil prices hit near 2 yrs. high with commodities esp. AG @ 2 yr lows was the 70's maybe?.  Wonder with rising cost w/much lower price on the farms, will famine spread beyound it's current borders?
3989 2018-07-09 15:42:49 I mix orange and peppermint oil with a little water and spray it all over. Works! Plus everyone thinks you smell refreshing. 
3990 2018-07-09 15:42:33 What you are saying is very true. What happens when the job market changes? When the oil is gone? We need thinkers. There have been other people commenting on useless degrees and high debt. This is a problem but not one that validates the elimination of Arts programs.
3991 2018-07-09 15:42:30 I'm going to get me some of that black seed oil today. If you have a Vitamin Shoppe it's there. I didn't realize that it had so many peer-reviewed studies: 600+.

3996 2018-07-09 15:42:10 Your hostility to #Obama has been noted; but facts are Obama signed the bill lifting the ban on US crude oil exports, which I'm sure even industry experts hostile to Obama, Democrats would admit has resulted in new oil being brought to market. But, yes, your hostility is noted.
3997 2018-07-09 15:42:09 Si claro en la Oil re quebrado ajajajajaj
3998 2018-07-09 15:41:44 I was legit looking for any traces of oil on the floor
3999 2018-07-09 15:41:41 I imagine if you warm the oil a bit, but not too much to start degrading the capsaicinoids, the solubility would increase. Some vegetable oils also might be better than others.

4038 2018-07-09 15:38:05 Sounds like you better huddle with Senator Sanders and share the 40 years of corruption data with him so he can conduct Congressional hearings!  And when you’re talking with him, ask why he has taken $116k in campaign donations from oil/gas. And HRC - $1.46mm; BHO - $1.97mm.

4043 2018-07-09 15:37:24 You mean the 'block grant'? Where Scotland receives a partial refund of taxes raised in Scotland and paid directly into UK treasury? (Not incl Oil/gas).

One big problem with your EU theory is that other non EU countries will want those same concessions, so No, they won't.

4045 2018-07-09 15:37:22 I have super sensitive skin that can also be super shiny, so I love CeraVe's foaming facial cleanser and Cetaphil's oil control moisturizer during the day. And at night I cannot live without my Origins High-Potency Night-a-Mins cream. It's expensive but works like a DREAM.

4080 2018-07-09 15:33:23 I think I'm proud to say that the cost of new brakes, spark plugs, oil change, etc. were just slightly more expensive than what I have left to pay down on the car itself...it will continue to be the most valuable and most expensive thing I own at age 28.
4081 2018-07-09 15:33:13 It’s my one day off, all I have to do is get an oil change and gas... and I don’t even feel like doing that.

4101 2018-07-09 15:30:37 and the strength of the US market (which determined the growth of Crude Oil from the beginning of July) is weakened. It is too early to talk about the consequences of this weakening - we will observe a day or two.
4102 2018-07-09 15:30:34 Give me a break! This is about money, oil, and maybe even Trump tower Russia!
4103 2018-07-09 15:30:30 Then you are a fanatic. Vivian's opinion is not influenced by "oil and gas". But like any sane person she is aware how important they are to our lives, unlike idiots who deny this.
4104 2018-07-09 15:30:30 I’m still a little salty that I’ve only been given a total of 7 droplets of oil for my popcorn over my last two trips to movies ten. 

They keep it up and I’ll be starting a popcorn oil black market from within the men’s restroom.

4111 2018-07-09 15:30:06 I say, "Ban all oil from countries that oppress women in any way. Rid the world of @OPEC - they're an antiquated regime whose time has gone". Ban oil from countries that have no or very little environmental and safety standards.

4134 2018-07-09 15:27:37 No doubt in my mind at all about that Lil Boo.  Trump is determined to one day change the name of this country to, "The Corporate States of America."  And when Corporations control the oil industry, the food supply, they become the POWER that controls us all.
4135 2018-07-09 15:27:28 Large % of MTN's clients are in Nigeria. Oil is Nigeria's largest export & central to the health of their economy. Higher oil price = improved Nigerian economy = higher personal disposable income.

4169 2018-07-09 15:24:21 Another ingredient to look out for:  

POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL:   dissolves oil and is commonly used in oven cleaners! Trust us, you don’t want this on your hair or skin. It strips away moisture and nutrients and is also a possible carcinogen.

4175 2018-07-09 15:23:36 What a shock. Current coal and oil lobbyist decides to eviscerate environment from inside the @EPA to bring profits for oil/gas/chemical/coal companies. Is this really news?

 It the fleet of hybrids are increasing.

And then we should consider that diesels can actually run 100% carbon neutral even using Waste products like used cooking oil.
A mix of different carbon neutral fuels would be the best way forward.

4197 2018-07-09 15:21:35 @KenDilanianNBC Ken time to investigate Anthony  Scaramucci coming back to Skybridge Capital. Probably using Trumps new Russian easing to invest in oligarchs and oil. Knowledge he gained in whitehouse strategy.

4208 2018-07-09 15:20:16 Also Norway generated £17 billion more oil and gas-related revenues that the UK last year- Same amount of oil, same global price.  Half of that would be a start
4209 2018-07-09 15:20:05 You retard, even if parts of the electricity comes from coal its still better then get your energy a 100% from oil. Which causes environmental desasters on a regular basis. Plus it's localy free of emission. The air you breathe in the city... Its not that difficult

4234 2018-07-09 15:16:29 Try chia seeds. Or best option Krill oil. It's pricier. Not all fish oil comes up again. You have to try different brands. Vitacost is a good site. #cryptobrain
4235 2018-07-09 15:16:29 Bin laden was only a threat because Reagan funded him to fight the soviets in the Middle East so we could hold control of oil. WW2 was a defensive war. Japan attacked us and was allied with Germany. I have no qualms with those claims.

4237 2018-07-09 15:16:25 I'll do what I can including my willingness to pay higher utility prices in the short and support green companies but no I'm not willing to go sleep in the woods. It doesn't need to be that extreme. Just stop supporting oil and gas power plants.

4275 2018-07-09 15:12:55 It is less a question of production and more of price. Soy oil is cheap. Palm and cotton seed are cheaper. Groundnut oil and mustard are comparatively more expensive, but have their own issues. Rice bran too. We already import vast quantities of soy oil.

4364 2018-07-09 15:04:24 @senorrinhatch conspired with Scott Pruitt to sell off our protected lands for oil and mineral leases.  The proof was in Pruitt emails that required a court order to be made public.  Hatch sold us out! He lacks moral decency.
4365 2018-07-09 15:04:16 Syncrude news smacked oil this morning, and Canadian energy with it. But bears couldn't hold their gains. There seems to be some rather hefty support for these stocks right now. Could be my imagination.

The money wasn't illegally obtained unless you feel selling oil is a crime.
Iran is not an illegal entity or in contravention of international law  - you're thinking of Israel.
What a bunch of slack jawed yokels THINK about Iran doesn't make it true.

4414 2018-07-09 14:59:34 Saudi Aramco was always a scam. The Saudis were trying to extract far more value than the oil they possess is worth. Even cut production to try and raise the price of oil to make it palatable. Nobody is foolish enough to buy a dying fossil fuel industry.

4426 2018-07-09 14:58:16 How would you do it for olive oil or is that too hard to do? Because I would probably use the oil more than the actual olives.
4427 2018-07-09 14:58:06 The President, including Trump have very little control over the prices of oil!  However, having said that, most of Obama’s last year as president showed gas prices lower than the prices now!  It is very difficult to gauge Iran after what Trump did!

4496 2018-07-09 14:50:10 Lmao B.o. = baby oil, you didn’t specify 
4497 2018-07-09 14:50:10 Girl and it’s so much in that tube. More than expected. You should check out the ordinary’s squalane oil and missha’s the first treatment essence.
4498 2018-07-09 14:50:04 baby oil
4499 2018-07-09 14:50:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
4500 2018-07-09 14:49:59 If it wasn't for the oil industry, tourism wouldn't even be an industry.
4501 2018-07-09 14:49:52 Lol I’ll try this rn if I knew what oil you talking about , I’ll ask around
4502 2018-07-09 14:49:48 Offsetting airmiles doesn't cut it. You are giving money to airlines, keeping airtravel profitable. Your money is going to those evil oil companies that everyone likes to blame, but we love their products, enabling us to lead comfortable, profitable western lifestyles.
4503 2018-07-09 14:49:44 This has no effect on pump prices. Syncrude is an upgrader, not a finishing refinery like those in Fort Saskatchewan. There is lots of upgraded oil to feed those refineries in Fort Sask. Prices going up is just sheer greed from the owners of those gas stations.
4504 2018-07-09 14:49:34 If this fails we will need a new system entirely, after another GE if it fails we've had enough, had enough of terrorists being created by scumbags and our family being put at risk so they can get rich off oil and weapons and we'll make it known as well, very known
4505 2018-07-09 14:49:33 right, used ad break to grab some of my own salt cured olives, that have been soaking in my freshly pressed olive oil with my chillis and thyme.  red wine too #couchpeloton #Sbstdf #toursnacks
4506 2018-07-09 14:49:23 the best way: fry it in olive oil for literally just 2 minutes, then add some salt, pepper and lime juice.

4510 2018-07-09 14:49:08 That big oil spill in the gulf did not hurt that fishing industry, the complete over reaction and MSM did. We were there. We watched MSM search for oily birds to film (and fight over the few). Sea turtle eggs were destroyed by so called environmentalists moving them.
4511 2018-07-09 14:48:48 Use avocado oil also,taste better than olive oil,do you measure you keto count with keto sticks

4516 2018-07-09 14:48:10 Fair competition is awesome, competing with offshore sweatshop countries like China is not fair competition. We need fair trade with Canada, US, EU. That means not stopping AB from selling their oil.

4602 2018-07-09 14:39:25 If they invest billions in say, new off shore drilling, and the public's demand for oil drops even a few %, then they can't operate these platforms at a profit, thus they become "stranded assets". Investing in coal or nuclear has the same danger.

4619 2018-07-09 14:37:23 honestly, it should work because pretty much everyone in my country uses coconut oil on their hair/scalp but definitely be wary of any allergies as such i guess?? it helps me a lot in terms of a healthier scalp tho!!
4620 2018-07-09 14:37:10 It's the start of the week and a great time to come in and get your footwear oiled. Remember, if you bought from us in the past we oil it for free! We'll also replace your laces while we're at it if needed!
4621 2018-07-09 14:37:07 We have similar hair. Just apply oil when wet, scrunch, and air dry. Lots of layers will help keep it from looking boxy or triangular.
4622 2018-07-09 14:37:06 if China doesn't buy from the US, it will buy from somewhere else who won't have oil for its other customers...

the "Others" who will be forced to buy from the US. 
 In the short term, you get price fluctuations, but the USA eventually wins 2nd customer anyways.

4654 2018-07-09 14:32:32 I’d fiscally tax oil produced properly. Like you know, actually tax it. That might help. 
I’d cut VAT as we would actually raise more by doing it seeing as we only get an estimated share. 
I’d slightly cut CT. See above. 
Once we get our real income I’m pretty sure we’d be ok.
4655 2018-07-09 14:32:26 It’s disgusting. The contempt I have for them could float an oil tanker.

4694 2018-07-09 14:28:16 Err maybe I'm lacking skills... but I find it hard to play with. But I think with sufficient skills you can make really nice painting with it :D

imo acrylic is easier to use than oil painting. Oil consume a lot of time but have texture which I really like.
4695 2018-07-09 14:28:09 Yep. And they're not doing it for the American people, because the only people that benefits from any of it are the big corporations - big oil, big pharma, military industrials, big banks, etc.

4702 2018-07-09 14:27:14 It’s ulli and coconut oil and the way we cut and cook vegetables. The poriyal tastes different because the vegetables are cooked in water first. For thoran, we rarely add more than a few drops of water (for eg). I could go on :)

4923 2018-07-09 13:59:53 One must give Fraud-Boy credit for getting max use out of the G650ER before the repo men take it away! Actresses in Australia, Turkish dictators, NYC costume parties, family trips to Israel & Ireland, pool toys to Thailand, photo ops in China- damning "big oil" the whole time,lol
4924 2018-07-09 13:59:46 What do those vehicles run ? Petrol or diesel ??
In case u did not realise, India imports more than 75% of its fuel requirements..Often the mercy of the oil producing countries that manipulate the price through supply constraints..in the process our currency rupee weakens !
4925 2018-07-09 13:59:45 what happens when we run out of oil and the soil goes dry and we can’t turn the lights on?
4926 2018-07-09 13:59:41 Almost every day I make a shake with spinach, chia seeds, soy milk, banana, ice, and basic peanut butter (as in toasted peanuts and palm oil). It’s so delicious. I also take daily vitamins + lysine and Emergen-C every night. I’ve pretty much avoided getting sick since doing this.

4934 2018-07-09 13:58:37 1) Let's talk about the obvious.

Trump expelled Russian diplomats
Trump applied more sanctions than Obama
Bombed Putin's ally
Broke a bad deal with another Putin ally
Sold weapons to Putin's enemy
Killed Russian oil exports

What kind of deal is this? One sided? Where's proof?

4946 2018-07-09 13:57:50 U know what the US also did? Using the CIA to putsh a democraticly elected leader out of government, that wanted to use the oil of the country to help its people, and put a Islamic dictator in his stead, that promised to sell oil cheap to the US, starting all this mess. BAD!

4950 2018-07-09 13:57:13 Solar works as a fuel saving technology when paired with fossil fuels, which has nothing to do with competition. It only makes sense when fuel is costly oil or natural gas.
Until there is a Global Electricity Grid, or cheap storage, solar is not enough for a zero-carbon system.
4951 2018-07-09 13:56:59 Selling an oil under production price is a clear indication that this isn’t actually pure essential oil....also the fact that their test results show this is adulterated......

4955 2018-07-09 13:56:24 Remember that the price of oil is speculative...the President knows this and he is slowly taking the teeth out of the Iranian regime’s necrotic bite.

4959 2018-07-09 13:55:58 Ok I am not going to argue. But what I am trying to get across is that the composition of olive oil and avocado oil is very similar (that is fact not conclusion). If one is healthy the other is as well. Personally I use both but for different things. And never on fish

4994 2018-07-09 13:50:33 Trump quit Iran Deal and put sanctions on Iran oil. Leading to price increases despite Trump’s calls to Saudi Arabia to increase production. Russia’s getting rich on Trump’s Iran problem as they sell more oil at higher prices! Did Putin tell Trump to walk away from the Iran Deal?

5037 2018-07-09 13:45:53 Nor are we responsible enough to use fossil fuels. Although an oil spill in and of itself is awful, one in the Arctic would be catastrophic for humankind. We also need to consider afforestation looking at our options.

You let the ashes and train and fuel and oil stay at the bottom of the cliff, so it can pollute the river( drinking water)

That is their logic
5045 2018-07-09 13:44:42 Ok. Since he's not here, let me try a shot at this with my crappy and not always reliable charting technique. This is what I see and think MAY happen. Of course, only the elephant has the TRUTH. Only he can lead us to glory. But let me share what I got just for now.

5053 2018-07-09 13:43:16 The great part about the USA is that if you want socialism, you have the freedom to go be a part of it...wherever it may be. It and the USA are like oil & water. Although, sadly, we already have too much of it here.
5054 2018-07-09 13:43:15 So a lawn, that basically doesn't need anything but water, and produces nothing except grass clippings that are biodegradable and some CO2 from the lawnmower (burning biofuel), is somehow worse than plastic straws that are entirely made from oil and never, ever, break down?
5055 2018-07-09 13:43:10 I hated my ex dude who wore "Golden Sand" oil, that shit smelt soooooo good and he looked sooo good that it made me hate the damn scent cause he looked and smelt that DAMN good. lol well he's long gone and now I'm wearing the shit

Thirty five centavos naman ang itataas sa presyo kada litro ng kanilang diesel.

GenX’ers & Millennials see Scott Pruitt as corrupt and hope he never gets back in the game of destroying Oklahoma’s environment. We’re not all oil-n-gas ppl.

5085 2018-07-09 13:38:11 Called @BillPageHonda to ask what went into a B1 service for a 2017 CR-V: oil and filter change, tire rotation, and “fuel additives for the oil”. Bargain price of $165. Without the “additives” it’d be $65. What exactly are these $100 “fuel additives for the oil”?

5099 2018-07-09 13:36:27 Heard somewhere that oil production has stopped there. Not sure about the details, but maybe this will help a solution
5100 2018-07-09 13:36:27 While my parents are debating over what oil to buy, I’ve chosen my groceries na. 
5101 2018-07-09 13:36:14 I selalu letak virgin coconut oil dkt rambut and scalp. 2 kali seminggu. Okay ke ?

5103 2018-07-09 13:35:46 30-min upper body done, plus 20-min extra cardio. Wooooo! Feels so good.
5104 2018-07-09 13:35:42 The problem is that analysts and the MSM DO believe that dookie. The shale oil phenomena has been the most successful example of deception I have ever witnessed in my over 50 years in the oil and natural gas business. America will someday be shocked, stunned, at the real deal.
5105 2018-07-09 13:35:31 That feeling of self loathing when you're pumping gas and you realize you are just pawn of capitalism and blood oil #MondayMotivation

5107 2018-07-09 13:35:06 @ImanAbdulRahim salam kak iman, nak tanya does mineral oil harms to skin? Saya bru beli senka perfect watery oil and senka tu contains mineral oil?
5108 2018-07-09 13:34:49 Whatever Captain Phony. You were the one who continues to get off topic. Accused me of prejudice. 
The real argument is that Russia since Peter the Great wanted access to Mediterranean. Iran want's part of Syrian oil production, Turkey benefits w/ weekend Syria as a power play.
5109 2018-07-09 13:34:38 Never cared for Dr Phil, to me seems like a snake oil salesman!!!
5110 2018-07-09 13:34:38 Now the oil price is back up, probably yes
5111 2018-07-09 13:34:36 You are so right.... what they were eating before was white bread & pasta, loaded with seed oil and cheese, french fries, fatty ,meat, and almost no veg.  Then go low carb: eat lean meat, cheese, VEG bcuz no other options, lose weight = blame the carbs. 
5112 2018-07-09 13:34:31 Oh no my pen cartridge cracked & all the oil leaked out

5115 2018-07-09 13:34:06 Thats not true. My dogs have never eaten pet food. I blend roo mince with vegetables and olive oil. Dogs are comforting.
5116 2018-07-09 13:34:03 I bought some cheap shampoo and conditioner from Boots for 75p a bottle. I can confirm it was that price for a reason, as my hair never got passed looking like it was drenched in Olive Oil all day.
5117 2018-07-09 13:33:58 Never cared for Dr Phil, to me seems like a snake oil salesman!!!
5118 2018-07-09 13:33:57 You had a reputation so bad you were almost unable to save your image after the oil spills. You've spent years now championing science, technology, renewable & clean energy so why do you sponsor the climate change deniers' megaphone? Time to cut ties w/ @FoxNews now, hypocrites.
5119 2018-07-09 13:33:52 Same age, same problem. Tempted to go the cbd oil way myself.
5120 2018-07-09 13:33:52 On Saturday December 8th, 2018, I am calling you to cook Chapo's in Nairobi.

Get a roller pin, save for a packet of Unga&some cooking oil.

On the same day, we will do a major BLOOD Donation Drive.

5130 2018-07-09 13:32:43 Hi Jeepi, we're working hard to ensure that our online shop is stocked with the medicine our clients need and we'll let our team know you'd like to see more CBD oil in stock.
5131 2018-07-09 13:32:36 If you Google Cannabis Oil Extract Bottles from 1850 you'll get 9pgs of them. Israel is so far ahead of Canada in research it's embarrassing. Cannabis cures and helps over 700 medical conditions and diseases such as Cancer, Seizures, Alzheimers, Chronic pain without the Addiction
5132 2018-07-09 13:32:34 One of our biggest problems is saying 'Nigeria is rich' based on the premise of having crude oil.
5133 2018-07-09 13:32:14 Get a cloth, put 10 to 20 drops of peppermint oil on it and put it on the floor of your shower. Feel better!
5134 2018-07-09 13:32:12 When you get the oil changed in your car do you prefer it just drained or drained and the new oil put in?
5135 2018-07-09 13:32:08 Iced bath or deep massage with olive oil
5136 2018-07-09 13:31:48 Why does that matter? Crude oil is controlled by the oil producing countries mainly from the Middle East. Its their oil and they control its output. Every country around the world pays the same price. Again, looking to blame others rather than yourselves.

5142 2018-07-09 13:31:13 Would also point out that the reduction of fossil fuel use will reduce the need for petrol/diesel and that alone gives an enormous drop in electricity use at refineries (about 5bn kWh, or 18bn EV miles). To refine oil to 1gl petrol uses enough electricity to move an EV 25 miles.

5160 2018-07-09 13:28:55 This is speculation, but we know what a capitalist American government does. Homeless veterens, children in poverty, medical bankruptcy, crippling student loan debt, increasing suicide rates, opioid addiction, tainted water, oil spills, corporate welfare... It goes on...
5161 2018-07-09 13:28:52 FYI : Gautam adani is the highest importer of palm oil among indiaans importer.
5162 2018-07-09 13:28:39 Apex court orders analysis of oil import mechanism https://Govt MUST get out oil business and NOT fix prices. Let private sector handle like in any other country in the world. Big racketeering is going on.

5179 2018-07-09 13:26:25 As you obviously have money, why not buy a Model 3! Many cars eventually have issues with power windows. Tesla has come a long way since you bought one of first Model 3! You will be disappointed with all the stupid knobs & buttons on gas burners & pointless reving, oil changes.
5180 2018-07-09 13:26:25 #oott any government that agrees to trump to stop importing Iranian oil and causing price to spike 30-40% is sort of crime against its people. It’s like stealing their hard earned money.
5181 2018-07-09 13:26:12 What does number 5 mean exactly? Midnight oil?
5182 2018-07-09 13:26:05 Love going for oil changes and there’s no wait plus getting a discount because I use to work at Canadian Tire
5183 2018-07-09 13:25:59 Middle east doesn't gives much to itself. See condition of Yemen, Syria, Jordan. Apart from Oil rich gulf countries those in Middle east and North Africa are poor countries.

5185 2018-07-09 13:25:45 So you think nothing ever breaks on off shore oil rigs.  Never a time that something needs attention below the water line.  The shallow thinking o0f liberals is mind boggling. @DanBongino is a expert compared to you?
5186 2018-07-09 13:25:37 The "Nigeria is the giant of Africa" ship sailed since 1977, the moment  yall's government decided to use the excess money made from the oil boom to throw a festival instead of investing in literally any other tangible thing.

We've never done anything "giant" worthy ever.
5187 2018-07-09 13:25:32 How do you think Trudeau lost the oil sector? Most job losses in that sector happened due to oil price drops before he was elected. No auto factories have left under Trudeau. Low dollar is great for Canadian exports.
5188 2018-07-09 13:25:02 Yep! To build support to lift sanctions! Then, they can go after Venezuelan oil.

1. The Body Shop CC Cream glow moisturiser - it gives me an amazing glow but doesn't leave my skin oily.

2. Tea Tree oil from THE Body Shop - helps rejuvenate my skin and helps minimize my blackheads.

Just unloaded my 2011 328xi for $9000 and had to put $800 days before and car had multiple oil leaks which are common - had 74000 miles.

5223 2018-07-09 13:20:02 I have done so, believe me. I even e-mailed a friend whose family is still very traditionally Italian. Seems to be a problem in the area where I live. People here actually think that’s how olive oil is supposed to taste, bitter.

5232 2018-07-09 13:19:14 In early 70’s Oil was priced in the $3 range and nobody paid much attention    Since then our oil producing provinces have been greatly enriched not by decisions taken here  but instead in the Middle East   This is seldom mentioned

5234 2018-07-09 13:19:02 You may get "some" EPA from plant-sources (ALA), but no DHA. The only chance you have is algae oil. Make sure it's from non-toxic waters.
5235 2018-07-09 13:18:57 Because was too stupid to see that Iran borders the Strait of Hormuz and all they have to do is sink a few ships there to block it. All the Mideast oil will be cut off.
5236 2018-07-09 13:18:54 Mike, I agree. I feel good when I drill a relatively simple vertical well w/ no frack of similar MD for only $4mm!

Just wanted you to see extent of the deception. If you believe the chart, everyone can drill EF wells for $4 mm. We must be the dumbest guys left in the oil patch.

hummus: chickpea+tahini+garlic+lemon+oil or thereabouts
[pulse] hummus: same recipe, subbing the pulse for some/all of the chickpeas
[non-pulse] hummus: same recipe, with the non-pulse added for flavor
Anything else is kinda a culinary play-on-words

5243 2018-07-09 13:17:34 e.l.f. products tested so far: oil free foundation (i can't find a proper name on the bottle?), mineral infused face primer, intense ink eyeliner, and the summer breeze palette. I love it all. Especially the foundation and the eyeliner.

    Upstream companies to benefit from higher crude prices.

    Oil marketing companies will be impacted by weaker gross refining margins and rupee.

5251 2018-07-09 13:16:29 Maybe they should stop lying to the American people.  Maybe they should put country ahead of party.  Maybe the American people refuse to accept the snake oil salesman and his cadre.  They stepped into this den of thieves...
5252 2018-07-09 13:16:29 @narendramodi As the world's biggest buyer of palm oil, India can seriously hurt Malaysian exports by raising tariffs in reprisal for @chedetofficial coddling of fugitive #ZakirNaik, charged with aiding terror attacks.

@BJP4India @ZeeNews @republic
5253 2018-07-09 13:16:23 .@CornerstoneOil: $Oil demand much stronger than supply & prices could rise $50/bbl before demand destruction occurs.  If even in the right ballpark economists’ #inflation estimates are too low.

5257 2018-07-09 13:16:03 Something to be proud of as we shutter oil, gas, timber, steel, aluminum and auto manufacturers? Socialist utopias never survive. The "fun" lasts until the money runs out. Then mass killings start in the ensuing chaos. See Venezuela & other former communist countries.

5264 2018-07-09 13:14:45 They'll talk about oil & gas. Exxon at one point held development leases worth 500 billion for the Russian part of Arctic.

 However, OIL and ONGC are expected to report sequential   increase in EBITDA driven by; (1) higher gas prices, (2) a weaker rupee   and (3) lower operating costs, which will be partially offset by lower   net crude realisation.

Just like the Whale oil industry of the 19th century. It ruled for 300 yrs. In less than 50, it was over. Not because of saving whales. Fossil fuel was cheaper. Next comes renewable energy.. because it's going 2 be cheaper.

5392 2018-07-09 13:00:18 Why should the military have guns? So they can pilliage for oil and overthrow leaders not as friendly to US interests? Also if you want to see cops disarmed start with that don't advocate using a militarized state to disarm the populace in a racialized fashion.

5451 2018-07-09 12:52:44 Want to have nice tanned skin, but instead you look like a Prune?

Apply copious amounts of #Hemp seed oil to your skin, but DO NOT rub in. Just allow #nature to go to work. I have no idea how, but #Hemp seed oil really brings out your tan!

5457 2018-07-09 12:52:16 So Trump will use consumers to pay for his expensive tax cuts to the wealthy. When you say consumer it's less personal. Like no blaming oil prices on OPEC.
5458 2018-07-09 12:52:10 I'm against Saudia Arabia 100% but because of big business and oil our governments won't do a thing .

5460 2018-07-09 12:52:03 Obama helped get Russia get kicked out of G8, he applied many sanctions, asked the Saudis to increase oil production to hurt Russian economy.

Putin’s anger at Hillary stems from those decisions..

5475 2018-07-09 12:50:13 Ever wonder how much shale (tight) oil is produced in the United States?
The U.S. EIA estimates that in 2017, about 4.67 mil barrels/day of crude oil were produced directly from tight oil resources in the US - 50% of total U.S. crude oil production in 2017. #northamericanshale
5476 2018-07-09 12:50:11 A house! That’s a long term investment, which can be sold, refinanced, rented etc. I already own a car and it’s so much work to maintain. From oil changes to battery, to transmission etc.

5484 2018-07-09 12:49:41 Big news globally that could lead to softening of Oil prices, is Saudi Arabia's Aramco,that produces 10% of world's Oil,seeing its $100bn IPO postponed to 2019,as global investors not willing to give #Aramco a valuation of more than $1trillion,while Aramco wants $2trln valuation!

5510 2018-07-09 12:45:47 #Libya #Libyaoil Some confusion over Libya oil production numbers. NOC says exports down 850,000 b/d after oil ports crisis + production now 527,000. However, production prior to oil ports events was max 1m. Possibly Libya producing for storage but not exporting?

5583 2018-07-09 12:38:39 ouch why you make it sounds so painful. Tak tau pulak akan gatal kalau nak keluar stretch mark. Cepatttt sapu oil before it get more worst

5710 2018-07-09 12:21:40 They're talking about the big CEO's of companies. Oil companies, coal mines, ect. And it's true. They have so much power over the rest of the world because they control the things we depend on. And it's only the top teeny tiny fraction, ignoring the plight of the earth for cash.

5742 2018-07-09 12:16:45 I think this reasoning is valid..US is doing double speak..While it wants shale gas fetch good price, it also needs to Make Us hydro carbon producers to benefit from higher oil prices within reasonable limits
5743 2018-07-09 12:16:43 Our "real" petrol price is about R 7.60; the reest goes to levies etc. So, it is the Government that takes most of the money, not neccessarily oil and ollar/rand exchange.
5744 2018-07-09 12:16:43 Well, I only got 2.5hrs of sleep. @TrackerBarrel maybe got an hour or so more.

5763 2018-07-09 12:13:49 3. Oil prices collapsed in 2009 to less than $30 per barrel due to global economic crisis and so HI's 2009 power price fell 8 cents/kWh from 2008. 2009 is a low priced year for that reason.

5816 2018-07-09 12:05:47 2. Hawaii's electricity prices have been tightly correlated to oil prices. HI in 2017 got about 27% of its power from renewables, with about two-thirds of that coming from PV & Wind, as it is diversifying and cleaning its power supply.

Soon, the FSA realised ISIS is their enemy & fought it ever after. ISIS was kicked out of Aleppo. ISIS sold oil to Assad & enjoyed safe passage through regime's lines.

5871 2018-07-09 11:58:30 Couldn't agree more! I'm from Norway myself. Our country with a strong economy due to high income from oil and gas will spend only 1.56% of GDP on defence budget this year. It's projected to drop to 1.5% for 2020.
5872 2018-07-09 11:58:25 The drop in oil production in #Libya could be a blessing in disguise. Libyan oil money, has in many ways, proliferated Libya's political/social/economic crisis. Oil money has enriched cronies, and oppressed the civilian. WE MUST RISE ABOVE OIL TO REINVENT OUR ECONOMY.

6144 2018-07-09 11:13:21 A big issue is dependency on RU oil for winter, cheaper to spend money on a pipeline (Iran/Azerbaijan/Turkey, etc). There needs to be collective will to do this as well as negate visas & assets ($100M flats in London, villas in France). 2% of GDP won’t deter asymmetric RU ops.

6256 2018-07-09 10:55:16 Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt & pepper, add fresh garlic & rosemary - wrap in foil and on the grill for 40-60 minutes. 
6257 2018-07-09 10:55:15 Conversion to EPA/DHA is pitiful. I would strongly recommend staying on fish oil. 

Try Fermented cod liver oil. Gets you a nice EPA/DHA ratio plus you're getting some vit K2.

6260 2018-07-09 10:55:02 @RachelNotley Oil at 75.00 US. 90 CDN. Loonie at 76 cents. When TMX Line 3 and KXL all come online the naysayers will be hiding in their shelters. The sky is not falling. Albertas recovery is continuing. Continuing to invest into Albertans is a wise option.

6271 2018-07-09 10:53:24 Hi @thereal_honey_ you advertised a range of oil perfumes on your timeline some time ago.are they still available?
6272 2018-07-09 10:53:23 Pro-tip, start applying coconut oil to your armpits to kill bacteria. It helps to reduce the smell dramatically. I’ll even use coconut oil without deodorant in winter because it’s so effective

6287 2018-07-09 10:50:35 When I was younger my Mother would annoint my forehead with oil and recite a prayer of protection. It was something that was passed down from generations.

6298 2018-07-09 10:48:36 The economics of the two are very different though. All we are doing with oil is renting land. How has NNPC fared with paying its cash call obligations for JVs?

6324 2018-07-09 10:43:48 It's simple. The "developed" countries have for centuries acted so that they keep up or increase their mass consumption, causing conflicts, wars and exploitation all over the world. They wanted cheap oil but they bought it with the death and misery of billions.

6328 2018-07-09 10:42:22 I appreciate this. I still wan't to say that crude oil alone didn't plunge us into recession. Our economy was put on hold for sic(6) good months. do you know what that means? Assuming we make 100,000,000 naira daily from one sea port, how much did we loose in 180 days plus?
6329 2018-07-09 10:42:22 More than 60 percent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free,” 
No word like majority here
6330 2018-07-09 10:42:18 Wow Aramco's expected oil production cost is an amazing $1 with Russia at $10 and North Sea Oil at $25 - $30. You really can rub your foot on the ground in Saudi and expect Oil to pop out!!!

6353 2018-07-09 10:38:37 Let's break it down:
 
More than 60 percent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country (meaning those who refused education out of the demographic in their 30s and not all those in their 30s)
6354 2018-07-09 10:38:34 What are the real choices for polymer processors today - the use of oil based olefin and styrenic materials for conversion into finished products has been the norm. However, there is now an eco-friendly option that should be considered in corn based bio-compostable granules.
6355 2018-07-09 10:38:31 HAHAHAHAHA EFFICASCENT OIL
6356 2018-07-09 10:38:17 I cut as much sugar out of my diet as possible a few months ago. Saw too many anti-sugar docs to justify sugar. I increased good fats like plenty of olive oil and avocado and lost weight.
6357 2018-07-09 10:38:02 Not too terrible thankfully. A little bit odd but I added some cinnamon over the top. And then two spoons of flax seed oil . After that nothing else really mattered

6401 2018-07-09 10:28:38 Oh so this is where it differs, they’re either scraps or bits, it’s bits of the batter that’s fallen away into the oil so it’s just deep fried batter basically and ITS HEAVEN

6403 2018-07-09 10:28:17 The irony is that total and immediate divestment from oil and gas would have been the strategy for delay. It would have taken the pressure off the businesses we need to engage with and who are beginning to respond  to our engagement. @tp_initiative

6408 2018-07-09 10:27:12 Crude Palm Oil Weekly Report – July 7th, 2018

Malaysia’s palm oil futures erased last week’s gains and fell for the third straight session due to concerns over the US-China trade war, lacklustre export data as well as tracking weakness in related oil.

6457 2018-07-09 10:19:53 Just saying but even as a South East Asian, people make a lot of smell jokes about us just because we're on the tan side.

We smell like curry, like oil, or we just simply "smell"

6459 2018-07-09 10:19:34 I think that's a good price for a sorted one.    At around 40-50k apparently the rear crank oil seal can start to seep so the clutch needs to come off and replace the seal.  My RT has that problem at the moment (56k) thinking about doing it myself...

6481 2018-07-09 10:16:07 There is no oil used in preparing or cooking the chicken and the charcoal grill burns off most of the fat from the chicken itself.

6506 2018-07-09 10:12:44 Hi excellent article. I exchanged messages with a shale oil price analyst who is convinced all is fine. Yet company debt profiles into the 2020's are frightening. They cannot meet repayment obligations unless billions of barrels of cheaply extractable oil mysteriously appear
6507 2018-07-09 10:12:26 My preference would be to have the warheads removed before the official independence date, and charge a hefty rent for a fixed (short) lease on the submarine base. And start surveying the firth of Clyde for oil (as a currency asset to leave in place).

6746 2018-07-09 09:23:46 @PMOIndia However in the event of crude prices of the world drastically reduced then certainly petrol prices should be reduced in the same ratio to that of crude oil

6848 2018-07-09 09:04:59 They've made plans for those 'powers' coming back from Brussels, to further exploit Scotland & Wales - to guarantee water & electricity supply, that oil stays a uk asset, and fishing (65% Scottish fleet & catch) is a trade-bargaining chip. And they don't want EU nationals voting.

6908 2018-07-09 08:53:35 The world is complex. You now complain about high oil price and that some countries must boost their production to bring it down. In 2015 oil price sharply dropped one of the different reasons was the closing of the Iran deal so production could better match the demand.

7120 2018-07-09 08:11:34 The ‘..keep your enemies even closer’ strategy might have appeared Machiavellian in July 2016, that in July 2018, 2 out of 3 back-stabbing snake oil salesmen are still in a job not involving a mop & bucket is proving catastrophic, much like their fantasy #Brexit project.

7123 2018-07-09 08:11:08 Can I suggest? Before you drybrush the base use "Nuln Oil" or "Seraphim Sepia" (not the glossy kind) on the rocks it'll find its way into all the nooks and crannies and add extra depth.

7210 2018-07-09 07:53:44 It misses the point. Stones are a finite resource too but we won’t be running out. Hydrocarbons are relatively abundant rather than scarce, given supply, demand & in particular the latter being transformed by transition. Supply will likely meet demand for the duration of oil era.

7472 2018-07-09 06:50:07 Even in countries that openly support renewables, fossil fuels are still where all the money is at. The number of people getting rich off renewables vs fossil fuels is minuscule.

7697 2018-07-09 06:04:51 Everyone chums up with the Saudi Royal family due to their possession of the Oil and gas deposits. I haven't seen many governmental figures oppose them, i think it would be a poor economic decision.

It isnt surprising they hate the single largest driver of wealth for the middle class.   
And it follows to reason they prefer tyrant oil as it enriches small gangs.

7719 2018-07-09 06:00:17 Boneless pork chops, half a cup of panko breading, and 2 tablespoons of rub.

Put rub and panko in a flat bowl, mix. Put chops in the bowl, push down firmly,  flip, push down firmly. On med hi heat put a tablespoon of oil or just eyeball it, and cook chop 4 min each side.
7720 2018-07-09 06:00:14 Peanut butter should only have one ingredient: ground up peanuts. That's it. It practically preserves itself because of the low water content and the oil.

7752 2018-07-09 05:55:09 I make rolled oats with whole chia, flaxseed, and some other stuff. There's a lot of dietary fiber you miss out on (in exchange for more concentration of omegas) with oil

7853 2018-07-09 05:31:23 The BJP-led NDA government has failed to control the prices of petroleum products as well. The country is reeling under highest ever petrol and diesel prices inspite of the all time lowest crude oil.

7917 2018-07-09 05:18:59 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa, I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating Fat cakes instead of rubbing the oil on his hands/head. 
7918 2018-07-09 05:18:48 Oh no! Something you ate? Take some Benadryl before you go to bed. Coconut oil on the hives doesn’t hurt either.

7924 2018-07-09 05:17:08 I buy empty capsules off Amazon for the fish oil etc...  Makes it easier to swallow without taste.
7925 2018-07-09 05:16:54 Oh I already know. Religion has you brainwashed and you think America is the “greatest country on earth”. Maybe if you realized the facts are different than your fairy tale bible, you wouldn’t think that way. So start listening to scientific experts and not big oil and religion.

7954 2018-07-09 05:10:22 The issue is that NDs don't see poor patients. They sell high dollar snake oil. I'm not saying that MDs are always the answer, but ignoring science or outright lying about it isn't right either.

7960 2018-07-09 05:09:03 The BJP-led NDA government has failed to control the prices of petroleum products as well. The country is reeling under highest ever petrol and diesel prices inspite of the all time lowest crude oil.

7978 2018-07-09 05:06:23 This pizzeria is claiming their story began “a thousand years ago in Italy when sun warmed tomatoes, basil and olive oil found their way onto flatbread” which is bullshit because tomatoes were never grown in Italy until the 1500s when they weee discovered in the New World

7999 2018-07-09 05:01:38 Flip side of that argument is that the NDs are snake oil salesmen who know that their treatments don't work or don't know enough about the problem to treat it correctly. Neither of those are good arguments.

8057 2018-07-09 04:49:53 Hello. I'm sorry about your diagnosis.  I know you don't know me but I've suffered from fibromyalgia and it was the worse pain I've ever felt. That being said, I started taking my magnesium and fish oil supplements and it really helped. Just thought I'd share. I hope that's ok.
8058 2018-07-09 04:49:42 If we know this, don't let it. When she runs her yap, run ours louder about the things they don't want us too. And ignore it. Soon fix that problem. Powers ours. They need us small people, whose going to build houses and dig oil otherwise, them? I think not.

With a heavy sigh, he slams himself down onto the couch, grabbing out his pack of cigarettes.
8070 2018-07-09 04:47:52 Yes g my shit was smooth but the wave cap helps keep it down. Also brushing while you shower and wash your hair keeps it from curling all the way back up. And you wanna oil and cover your hair while it’s slightly damp. Not too wet not too dry.

8103 2018-07-09 04:43:44 Nah flax is very inefficient for ALA conv. - its main benefit is the fiber content.

Look up Krill oil - its better absorbed, you wont get fish burps, though its still new so dosage is sketchy, no one has a clear answer as to how much you need.

8135 2018-07-09 04:38:40 Oil prices were not only a factor. The main reason was wrong trade n foreign policy by the govts then.Indian export heavily relied on Soviet Union which was badly hit after its disintegration.The govts did not improve trade n political relations wid d west.

In UPA time Center was taking RS.9 tax per liter but current Govt is taking Rs.21 tax per liter.

Avocado
Eggs
Olive oil
Fresh garlic 
Wild growth 
Mix a little amount and put it in your hair and leave it for about an hour do this every 2 weeks for 2-3 months and you will see a big difference.

8347 2018-07-09 04:08:46 what is CBD oil ??
8348 2018-07-09 04:08:45 I enjoy working on my son's car. We get to spend a few hours wrenching, talking and he learns a few things too. We also changed the oil.

8352 2018-07-09 04:08:20 Bullish on privacy but I think governments will wage war against them. I like alternative energy but big oil companies will fight them too. Probably interoperability since it doesn't threaten to replace anyone
8353 2018-07-09 04:08:19 ん？貴方初対面の相手にもタメ語なんですね？常識を持ち合わせてないんですね。あと自分糞ガキじゃないんで((´°ω°*))ヶﾗヶﾗ自分が貴方にガキって言ったの精神年齢ですよ

8355 2018-07-09 04:07:51 How? He bombs their ally and only foothold in the middle east. He signs the bill prohibiting himself from interfering with sanctions against Russia. With our new energy sector growth he's cutting Russia's cost per barrel on oil. He's lambasted Russian aggression. Oh! CNN told you
8356 2018-07-09 04:07:49 The girls faces when they found out they were going to an oil distillery was hilarious.  Blank stares #rhop

8362 2018-07-09 04:07:09 If you ever wanted to know what losing 100 dollars feels like, just use your clumsy, disabled, spasm-y arms to knock a bottle of CBD oil onto the floor and have the bottle shatter. Cool.
8363 2018-07-09 04:07:07 But to your other point - yes, Clinton ran a botched campaign. It is her fault she lost, along with the unfortunate reality that over 40% of the country were duped by Trump's snake oil. But that's life.
8364 2018-07-09 04:06:57 Also, the richest scientists, by far, are geologists who go to work for the oil industry.
8365 2018-07-09 04:06:55 Drunk on your leftists koolade while avoiding the plethora of available data.  You and Bernie can fight big oil together until the cows come home. Good luck.

8367 2018-07-09 04:06:48 Trump talking about putting oil sanctions on Iran, if he does that, expect gas prices in North America to spike up significantly.... one bad decision after another...

8371 2018-07-09 04:06:06 Pres. Trump called for (OPEC to stop manipulating oil prices and urged Saudi Arabia to pump more if it wanted Washington to continue protecting it against its top rival Iran. #Iran #Saudi #OPEC
8372 2018-07-09 04:05:49 Olive oil has a smokjng point of just over 400 degrees. You can/should fry chicken, for example at 350 degrees.
8373 2018-07-09 04:05:45 Yum! Usually before I grill my steaks I'll coat them in a oil, just a little bit to help the seasoning stick to it, and it definitely helps the steak not stick to the grill.
8374 2018-07-09 04:05:35 Record low unemploy, record tax breaks w/gov coffers overflowing $$, record number of jobs being created, cutting job killing regulations, net oil exporter, record # of ppl now employed. Record # of women & minorities n his cabinet & White House staff. Wheres the beef?

8376 2018-07-09 04:05:21 High oil prices coupled with high demand for petroleum can raise CPI. The market does have some great tools to increase the supply & put downward pressure on oil prices at least in the medium term

Sarraj and Salame reiterate that the NOC in Tripoli is the sole legitimate entity to manage Libya`s oil #Libya
8400 2018-07-09 04:01:50 This is wrong and should be condemned by all individuals across the globe. The sad part though is that warhawks in the west and Middle East are using this case and others to push for regime change, ergo supply of weapons to dissidents and eventually controlling oil smh.
8401 2018-07-09 04:01:46 It is a shame that you withdraw from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. You are promoting the kill of our jungle and diversity. SHAME @Nestle
8402 2018-07-09 04:01:46 and recently telling other nations we wont do any trade unless they totally embargo Irans oil. drive the prices and market up. Trump even is willing to start a war with China over it-they import the most iranian oil.

8420 2018-07-09 03:59:46 Bro, oil and vinegar are necessary.

Layton Lee got the win, allowing 4 hits over three innings with 5 Ks. The Wombats got 8 hits. William Dunn and Caskey had two.
8426 2018-07-09 03:58:45 Especially when, correct me if I'm wrong, being ethical towards animals with commercial products can be a bottomless pit. Eggshells used in wine production, but not ingredient. "Sustainable" palm oil. Unethical human rights for garment producers. The businesses hide ethics.

8506 2018-07-09 03:43:18 Look at CapEx ex-Energy as the vast majority of CapEx growth is due to spike in oil prices vs. broad sector CapEx spending growth. Buybacks look to be up 40+% vs. last year, which leads to de minimis wage gains for workers and the reason why Americans don't like the Tax Cut @cnbc

Companies pumping far more oil with fewer rigs. Efficiency helps? 

Methane & other air regulations in place before production boom.

CO = 1/10 of TX production. Doesn’t mean we’re not contributing to global pollution, but on much smaller scale—with tougher regs.

8572 2018-07-09 03:34:57 The increase in gas prices. That's a result of a bill that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell got Obama to sign allowing the export of American oil. The funny thing was. Rush Limbaugh commented on it, back when it passed. Said it would probably cause a increase in gas prices.
8573 2018-07-09 03:34:50 Nothing is ever enough when dealing with progressives. Compromise is seen as a weakness to be exploited. We are already there. Boycotts, blacklisting, harrassment, violence threats and shutting down speech. Just a matter of how much farther will it go.

8635 2018-07-09 03:25:19 Ralph sold off many Alta assets to help pay off PC debt; the assets that generated millions of dollars in fees thinking that oil was going to be king forever. He sold those assets to his PC cronies @ firesale prices & called it free enterprise. Ka-ching$$$ You’re such an idiot.
8636 2018-07-09 03:25:17 I do put oil and vinegar on my sandwiches down here in the southeast.

8641 2018-07-09 03:24:42 I at least put baby oil on there instead of baby powder! I'm not COMPLETELY disrespectful. <_<
8642 2018-07-09 03:24:33 @RBReich All relate to #4 —-profits increase for big oil if u deny #1, many profit from a military complex, if they don’t pay their fair share of taxes #3 increases, #5 and # 7 are used to keep them in power and accomplish #6 for continued policies that enable  power & profits

8647 2018-07-09 03:24:02 So they both had the same idea, only Trump wanted to also take their oil. Isn't that worse? And is your defense of Trump merely that he was busy bankrupting casinos while Hillary was actually in power, so it makes it okay that they both publicly stated they wanted to do it?

8654 2018-07-09 03:23:35 Venezuela didn't fall because of socialism exactly.
Socialism was actually working for them until their main export (95%) oil price plummeted and they began to pull away from social programs, and their ridiculous levels of govt corruption
8655 2018-07-09 03:23:18 Until their water is so polluted from fracking that they can't drink it. Otherwise they don't care because the prevailing winds usually deposit the pollution to the east of OK. An issue the US EPA chief SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONCERNED WITH! But he was only interested in oil & Gas $$!
8656 2018-07-09 03:23:10 Yes Jamaican oil
8657 2018-07-09 03:23:06 1) My take is that the Rothchilds and the Pope are the cult leaders with the Roths controlling banks and financial institutions and controls gov'ts world wide.  The gov'ts in turn control the people.  Saudi Arabia has control over oil/tech and involved with children/trafficking.
8658 2018-07-09 03:23:01 Oh, no. Saturated fats are associated with more insulin resistance, not less. Data are relatively consistent here. Olive oil, yes, not others
And, of course that's difficult. Seed oils are shelf stable, require less energy to produce, and are liquid at room temps.

You're an oilfield guy. 
The #TMX is getting built.
Oil is recovering.
The carbon levy protects Albertans & industry by giving industry what they asked for & keeping $'s in Alberta for investing here

What do you want to see done differently?

8669 2018-07-09 03:21:38 oil paintings aren't a genre. 99% of modern art is shitty so yeah you'd be justified saying fuck modern art, good comparison actually.

8672 2018-07-09 03:21:21 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
8673 2018-07-09 03:20:46 Glycerin is good for attracting moisture from the air (so use when humid). Castor oil is great for strengthening hair. I use an infusion of oils (rose, steel cut oats), sweet almond oil) and Jamaican black castor oil in my hair regularly.
8674 2018-07-09 03:20:39 Nahhhhh bro. Oil and vinegar is all I get on my subs. I’ve done that in Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, North Dakota...
8675 2018-07-09 03:20:31 On the other hand, most voters of both parties have learned that voting for an inexperienced, shallow resume, policy detail-free snake oil salesman can be a catastrophe.
8676 2018-07-09 03:20:25 I have so much anxiety for tomorrow. Might take a sea salt bath with vinegar, rosemary oil and agua de florida to calm me down.
8677 2018-07-09 03:20:13 The fact is; Precipitated by the Gulf War, India’s oil import bill swelled, exports slumped, credit dried up, and investors took their money out. Large fiscal deficits, over time, had a spillover effect on the trade deficit culminating in an external payments crisis.
8678 2018-07-09 03:20:06 I smoked my oil cartridge @ Wrigley today. NOT for me. But for the culture  we did it you guys
8679 2018-07-09 03:19:54 We live in a world where undead zombie MMA morticians can shoot lightning from their hands, and Voodoo dudes can make people bleed oil and puke on command by stealing an arm band, but some people draw the line at intergender wrestling? WUT.

8681 2018-07-09 03:19:33 Went to put my keys in the basket by my bed. I literally have 3 bottles of anointing oil in there. I keep bringing them home on Sundays after church. Just stick them in my pocket and forget about them. #pentecostalproblems

8683 2018-07-09 03:19:25 Oil prices are likely to be weighed down by the trade conflict as investors are concerned about the impact of the tariffs and counter tariffs on global economic growth.  #oott

8685 2018-07-09 03:19:16 Is oil and vinegar on a sub just a north eastern thing? Because I just asked these people in this sandwich shop and they acted like they didn’t know what I was talking about.
8686 2018-07-09 03:19:07 This is sheer blasphemy Mr. Jain. Referring to a Saint as Mother...You will spend your afterlife in vats of boiling oil. 
8687 2018-07-09 03:19:03 Beware of an oil tycoon founded/funded group called Protect the Harvest. They love killing #AmericanWildHorses, sport hunting, factory farming,& allowing GMOs. They support whatever makes the govt & their founder $$. They don't believe animals have rights, but are fair game.
8688 2018-07-09 03:18:48 What do you guys use to dry out your pimples? Tea tree oil isn’t working for me (could be the brand?)
8689 2018-07-09 03:18:39 Just take black seed oil, don’t take it at night before u go to sleep. Dreams be vivid as a bitch and WILD
8690 2018-07-09 03:18:36 I feel that any new money spent on tar sands is foolhardy. What is the cost of one? 1B$... more? Think how much return could be generated from next energy technologies with no risk to a 14$B/yr coastal economies real (not future) jobs. Time for oil companies to evolve.

8697 2018-07-09 03:17:18 Oh! My goodness, that's a great idea.  I've been using eucalyptus oil, a delightful scent, but it lingers far too long on the book
8698 2018-07-09 03:17:13 @realDonaldTrump called for invading Libya and taking their oil. He did it on video. How is that position not worse than Hillary's? Help me understand why it's different when Trump called for the same thing?

8707 2018-07-09 03:16:05 Oil prices inched up in early Asian trading on Monday, with many investors focused on any fallout from the U.S. imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods at the end of last week, slapping tariffs on $34 billion worth of each others’ goods.  #oott

8709 2018-07-09 03:15:52 Increasing oil prices might have had something to do with that growth. That and companies needing to rebuild reserves thru drilling. Main thing though, the economy was so gutted, it could only grow. #NotleyCountdown
8710 2018-07-09 03:15:51 It’s a joke. Because #Cult45 doesn’t read. See?

A woman called a public figure - who’s ideas have led to baby jailing - “trash.” I would have used “troglodyte elitist snake oil salesman.”

If one acts the way they do, yet cannot handle free speech... They. Should. Stay. Home.

8759 2018-07-09 03:08:52 What about the Haitians stranded in their own country? Americans are not the most important people in the world. People without a voice need advocates. Haiti has oil under its soil. There is a bigger problem and greater solution than burning tires.

8781 2018-07-09 03:04:01 “Ur miles may vary”. I’m in my early 30s so masking everyday provides extra benefits to my skin on top of the skincare routine.

8825 2018-07-09 02:59:14 Good news, I can get Jack to eat if I just put sardines packed in oil on top of his food and mash it up with a fork and then bring it to him personally under my bed

8847 2018-07-09 02:56:32 Just so everyone knows, Saudi Arabia is so salt at Qatar that they are digging a big ass canal to make Qatar an island. 

God I wish I had oil money to do crazy shit

8849 2018-07-09 02:56:28 Olive oil from Italy is controlled by the mafia.  You don't get what you think.  The SLO olive oil is terrific, as advertised and should be your choice now.  Love it!

8855 2018-07-09 02:55:35 We have oil and gas, and should be using it for our people instead of buying from them.
8856 2018-07-09 02:55:30 processed or has added sugar and all that processed grain oil garbage.  It really changes our world view. There's this meme that we now only shop there outer portion of the markets now where the veggies and meat counters are located. Everything in the center tends to drive IR.
8857 2018-07-09 02:55:28 เคยใช้ละ ไม่รู้สึกว่าสะอาดขนาดนั้น ราคา+ปริมาณ ซื้อ cleansing น้ำหรือพวก cleansing oil,milk ใช้ได้นานกว่าเยอะ สรุปสำหรับเราคือ ไม่คุ้มค่ะกับราคาสำหรับคนแต่งหน้าแทบทุกวันแต่อ่อนโยนจริงแบรนด์นี้คนแพ้ง่ายสมควรใช้
8858 2018-07-09 02:55:23 Olive oil has a low smoke/burning point so it isn't good for deep frying... I took that too serious.
8859 2018-07-09 02:55:15 It's a tough environment in the oil and gas industry, but Holland's stainless steel #nameplates are manufactured to last.

8878 2018-07-09 02:50:28 Or money laundering for Russians and whatever other reasons he has for putting Putin's interests first. His pulling the US out of the Iran Nuclear Deal drives oil prices up for Putin. Trade war has China buying soybeans from Russia.

8888 2018-07-09 02:48:52 PS To anyone who happens to read this4 the TRAIN law is not the sole reason for the fluctuating oil prices. Multiple factors stated in the article made by the DOE as cited above are considered.

So don't expect drop in advtg. Clutter. It will only reduce when other sports become a serious threat to cricket viewing

8923 2018-07-09 02:45:02 No, bc separating families for a misdemeanor offense is evil & is why Bush & Obama wisely didn't enforce it. A wall won't do anything as most illegals aren't gang members but those who overstayed their visas. is obviously lying. Coal &amp; oil companies deserve nothing
8924 2018-07-09 02:45:01 Iran oil exports in 2017 was 2.1 million barrels daily. U want to reduce it to 0 by Nov. It will cause misery to poor and middle class in US and world already suffering by high oil prices. Please take steps or Republican candidates will pay a steep price in Nov.

8927 2018-07-09 02:44:55 My question was originally, has the pathetic government passed legislation/law requiring any of these oil producers too clean up after production by a certain time after production ends? Could you imagine Suncor/Syncrude walking away from the Orphan Tar Sands 
8928 2018-07-09 02:44:53 Oil prices rise because they can jerk it up and down and know right now the world needs it....someday maybe hydrogen or something else will be more plentiful and cheaper....
8929 2018-07-09 02:44:52 yes it does, cause your scalp still has pores so when those pores are dirty and clogged your hair won’t grow as much. so using oils like grape seed oil helps with thickness and curl pattern, and almond oil is my favorite cause it smells good and it’s light!

8931 2018-07-09 02:43:40 How synthetic milk is produced?  

Vegetable refined oil (any brand) whose butyrorefractometer reading is less than 42 is taken in a wide mouthed container along with a suitable emulsifier and thoroughly mixed so that the entire content is made in to a thick white paste.

8933 2018-07-09 02:43:27 GLOWING SKIN: 
Just put some olive oil on a cotton pad and gently massage the oil onto your face to get rid of the makeup and dirt:
DON’T:Forget that exfoliation is indispensable. At least once or twice a week, exfoliate your skin to remove the layers of dead skin, sure to leave

8937 2018-07-09 02:42:40 Why would you expect to be able to know that while it still *is* now?

If you mean there aren't as many famous oil paintings being produced, that's true, but animal drawings on cave walls have also fallen out of fashion.
8938 2018-07-09 02:42:38 Canada is easy target. Lots of people more concerned with legalized pot than researching world affairs.  If Suzuki and trudeau say Canada's oil is dirty then they are happy to ride the bus  (diesel) or hitch hike (gas or diesel) around and spread the message.
8939 2018-07-09 02:42:38 Let Cool and invert on a plate.  Can do the same with tomatoes.  Olive oil for butter, rosemary for sugar, maybe a garlic clove or two.

8942 2018-07-09 02:41:55 Radical thought. It is an oil companies job to sell as much oil as possible.  It is an Americans job to buy as little oil as possible. Stop blaming oil companies for the failures of Americans.

8947 2018-07-09 02:41:13 Falsities of belief come from not having the union of faith and charity in heart, like the virgins that had a lamp but no oil and couldn't enter the wedding (heaven). Lack of union the cause of all falsities in doctrine; union of external & internal in soul determines salvation.
8948 2018-07-09 02:41:06 I use Jamaican Black Castor oil to seal in the moisture. L,C,O and when take them down i use the same oil on the tips of my fingers. That’s me twisting overnight to make sure it’s “dry.”

8963 2018-07-09 02:39:08 we need to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, but rather than embrace “drill here drill now” and “drill baby drill” @realDonaldTrump is begging Saudi Arabia to increase oil production and he makes no mention of the fact that we need to build more refineries
8964 2018-07-09 02:39:04 What policies are you referring to? The trade wars where farmers are suffering? The deregulation of clean air, water, food?

8975 2018-07-09 02:37:41 Homeopathic medicine is snake oil. Better yet it is worse than snake oil, at least in those days (which was a Wednesday if your wondering) people didnt have the science to refute it.

- Make a face mask and scrub (mask: 1 egg + 1/3 cup of honey; scrub: 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup olive oil, 1 tbs honey)

9032 2018-07-09 02:31:27 Russian propaganda is also amplifying fears in the Western media about fracking and nuclear as well as pushing climate denial trying to keep oil prices high to keep their economy afloat. That Moscow sees fracking as their greatest threat so they are in a defensive war w us.

9056 2018-07-09 02:28:45 What is the reason for price fluctuations of oil and gas? Those are also energy resources like uranium.

9194 2018-07-09 02:08:28 You have to be kidding me. This is full on normalization of a murderous foreign enemy to get sanctions lowered.The Russians ILLEGALLY annexed theCrimea&want to steal its oil! You are complicit in Donald Trump’s treachery with Vladimir Putin and on the 4th of July no less#traitor
9195 2018-07-09 02:08:21 Potable water is the new Oil
9196 2018-07-09 02:08:21 WTF? The one’s benefiting VASTLY more than ANY scientist are earth-fucking oil corps for one thing, and they sure as hell aren’t going to be paying for cleaning the legacy pollution they leave behind under the guise of “jobs creation”.
9197 2018-07-09 02:08:05 The most prominent effect of IRI following through on this idle threat would be to prevent IRI from selling oil to PRC, its sole remaining major customer, thereby ending all revenue to IRI, and preventing IRI from achieving client state status....

9201 2018-07-09 02:07:49 Struggled through a few batches at first too—Chondi dropped a great hint earlier—don’t over crowd the frying apparatus & cut parts into similar sizes. 

I’d add, let the chicken come up to room temperature, going straight from fridge to dredge to fryer, drops your oil temp a ton.

9206 2018-07-09 02:07:33 Buruf tu apa?? Buruf oil ka
9207 2018-07-09 02:07:32 The pilots I know assure me oil leaks are a good thing. If it’s not leaking oil, it’s dry!
9208 2018-07-09 02:07:30 With a really fruity/peppery olive oil and some fresh lemon.
9209 2018-07-09 02:07:27 I used a new face wash that smells like grapes, and coconut oil for moisturizer. So my face smells like a fruit smoothie. Not complaining tho.

pushes back KG gas production target date to end 2019; oil delayed by a year
the first gas was targeted for June 2019 and first oil was to flow by March 2020
But now, first gas is expected by December 2019 and oil by March 2021

9214 2018-07-09 02:06:23 I don't oppose solar energy
What I do oppose is people people being supporting human rights abuses. Buying middle east oil does this.
How is Saudi Arabia getting the money to fund their solar energy farms and storage? Canada can use oil dollars to pay for transition to renewables
9215 2018-07-09 02:06:05 こんにちは。お返事ありがとうございます。はい、2LとLの2枚の譲渡でお願いしたいです。
9216 2018-07-09 02:05:50 I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love, but all I needed was some coconut oil~
9217 2018-07-09 02:05:45 It goes to weapons and shit like planes that sit in the desert. Also right into oil companies pockets

9220 2018-07-09 02:05:21 That's exactly what I will do, should I cook it in coconut oil or a little steamed water? #keto
9221 2018-07-09 02:05:18 Since the US doesn't use Iranian oil and doesn't need ME oil, it makes little sense for IRI to start a war by actually following through with its 514th threat to block the Strait of Hormuz....
9222 2018-07-09 02:05:10 #Monday Cues:
- Asia holding up despite continued trade rhetoric (Trump threatening with Tariffs worth $500 mn)
- Oil rangebound
- Dollar down (DXY below 94 this morning)
- Flows into #mutualfunds taper off in June (Down 32% mom @ Rs 8237 cr; flat yoy)
This last point worries me
9223 2018-07-09 02:04:56 I got 20 mosquito bites in a matter of 5 minutes earlier. Came right in the house and covered myself in melaluca oil. All of the bumps are now gone except for 3. #MELALEUCAMAGIC
9224 2018-07-09 02:04:50 Oh yeah! I more or less used that recipe, but I went with penne and the reserved oil from some calabrian peppers for heat. @BingingWBabish
9225 2018-07-09 02:04:37 Most kids get summer jobs before college to learn value of a dollar, you are nothing mire than a snake oil salesman, a carnival act.
9226 2018-07-09 02:04:24 Putin & trump want the Artic. The oil; NW passage; the minerals & the fresh water of Canada’s Gt Lakes. Who will stop them & how?

9229 2018-07-09 02:03:29 Please explain why you single out oil tankers? There are far more ship movements of other goods and people, surely all vessels should be your target?
9230 2018-07-09 02:03:28 Jacinda & Winnie will soon have their parliamentary  electric bikes to cruise on so no more oil be needed 
9231 2018-07-09 02:03:09 Maybe someone your liberal pro Chice democratic self you “used to be” would choose. You phony snake oil salesman working the white man fascist ladder.

9240 2018-07-09 02:02:06 The 4 major shale fields are the cheapest sources of US oil right now.  After those are done, another 40 shale plays can be drilled. And we still have plenty of offshore plays after that.
9241 2018-07-09 02:02:05 I stay in awe at some of these snake oil salesmen. Be out here truly juuging & finessing.

9246 2018-07-09 02:01:28 Venezuela sinked cause there entire burden and dependence was on oil and petroleum export. And that sector crumbled terrible after 2013 which exposed their faulty policies.

9268 2018-07-09 01:57:42 Wrong timing if I may say. At a time when the world is shifting from the use of oil to renewable energy. He'll make his money though and I think the monopoly will then push us to provide an alternative

9281 2018-07-09 01:56:18 We've had news stories about families having to travel to Colorado to get the oil for their infants and lately there's been a big push due to influx of ppl moving here for jobs from states where it was legal. But we're still very much under red control. Crossing fingers for Nov.
9282 2018-07-09 01:56:14 How much do you know about the conflict in the Middle East? Every one loves to talk about oil, and ulterior motivations may be real, however the real mission has always been to remove the threat and operation of terror groups.

9294 2018-07-09 01:53:56 Would it be unreasonable to look at the exports that these pipeline delays are causing as offsetting oil from the middle east? 
Proportionally calculate how many people killed in middle eastern conflict by barrels oil. Multiply by the offset TMX will allow =lives saved

9296 2018-07-09 01:53:03 Mr. @MarioAndretti , my prayers and condolences go out to you and your family on your loss. Too bad your wife couldn't have made it to our Meet and Greet with Colvin Oil in Grants Pass last year, I would have loved to have met her. Sincerely, @DanielEndres8 (Daniel Endres)
9297 2018-07-09 01:53:00 Iraq was attacked because Saddam had indicated he would sell oil in eurose. America depends on the oil dollar which maintains its military machine. At the formation of OPEC america gave assurance to OPEC member states of its protection as long as oil was sold for dollars.
9298 2018-07-09 01:52:58 Luluran pake kopi, trus tiap abis mandi pakein minyak zaitun. Evo oil ya.. harus sabar, tp ampuh kok.
9299 2018-07-09 01:52:43 Exactly, another reason Putin wanted the sanctions. Raises price of rofsnet oil. Then, abolish EU and NATO. And then invade south America, finally, world domination. Fin.
9300 2018-07-09 01:52:19 I disagree, Scotland's went into a massive deficit since the SNP took over, Granted party to the oil crises but by far they have burdened the economy to a dismal state

9305 2018-07-09 01:51:18 Not true! You get to choose your attitude! Every day! Every meal! 
If I can change the oil in my lawnmower, you can learn to cook from YouTube! Lots of easy ideas!
9306 2018-07-09 01:51:06 I'm not 100% sure, but I do know that it's oil based like margarine is.
9307 2018-07-09 01:50:56 Fuck that dude he seriously almost made my family homeless. He stopped paying companies that drilled for oil and didn't find anything. Which left my father w/o a job. For a young man with little education and a new family that screwed us bad.
9308 2018-07-09 01:50:47 Visitors were told that Canola is grown for the seeds which produce a heart healthy oil. No endorsement of eating canola leaves was made

9317 2018-07-09 01:49:28 Yes!  This keeps the salad from getting soggy....and I put balsamic vinegar, olive oil and spices in the bottom.  Perfect lunch!

9326 2018-07-09 01:48:01 The taste was good but, temperature control of the oil, and using the right skillet are learned lessons going forward. A few pieces were crispy delicious on the outside and rare in the inside. Will try again!

Emergency crews are attending Citylink for incident eastbound from Montague St to Burnley St off-ramp which appears to be an oil/diesel spill. Take care around Burnley/tunnel as it will take some time to clean up & diesel is extremely slippery and difficult to see.

9352 2018-07-09 01:43:39 No offence but the explanation is very broad and not specific to oil shipment. Numbers are also worldwide, including countries with less to no safety standards.

9359 2018-07-09 01:42:16 I thought this was all about the oil to Europe dance still.  Russia was meant to join the "NWO" to quarantine and push China to the same.  They backed out and now oil is their lifeline to keep their Econ afloat.

9459 2018-07-09 01:22:41 I've done it, brush some olive oil on cut edge of a split romaine, sizzle it on a griddle with sea salt and then QUICKLY shave on some parmesan and frozen balsamic vinegar scrapings. But it's good for like 90 seconds, a wilted mess afterwards
9460 2018-07-09 01:22:24 They will need it because oil reserves are wildly inflated. Close to 85% of Saudi oil comes from 6 fields that are 50 years old +. Almost zero exploration success 40 years. New fields actually fields discovered 50 years ago that didn't make cut. Saudi like Fed in transparency con

9477 2018-07-09 01:20:36 PoseFX makes me miss my uncle. I dunno if this was his scene (maybe his partner's) but this music.... 

This music is on the cassettes I used to high-speed dub when he was washing the motor oil off his hands in the kitchen sink.

9479 2018-07-09 01:20:21 Is China not also the worlds largest consumer of oil? Does the majority of their oil not come from countries with worse human rights records than them? Please explain why it is ok to support human cruelty by opposing Canadian oil. #supporttmx #opposeisis

9482 2018-07-09 01:19:39 It has nothing to do with you. Also, Tehran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz and cut off oil  trade through the Persian gulf entirely, in the event that the US  attempts to disrupt Iranian oil exports.
9483 2018-07-09 01:19:23 Any energy source that is not renewable will be fully depleted. Those that add greenhouse gases will inhibit sustainable energy such as solar from being used.

9486 2018-07-09 01:18:57 My Lebanese friends make fun of me because I do weird things like eating nuts and olive oil on top of lebnah. But I have never once ever thought that eating chocolate with hummus would be good. Just saying.
9487 2018-07-09 01:18:49 Did they run out of oil money?

9493 2018-07-09 01:17:52 The CBD oil stops her from shaking so violently, but by no means is it a cure for her fear.
9494 2018-07-09 01:17:51 I discovered that 50% eggs, 50% cheese, mixed together, fried with just a little oil on one side on low heat for about 3 minutes, then flipped and cooked for two more, is pretty darn nice.

9500 2018-07-09 01:16:32 I felt like this time was even worse than normal tho

Me: Uses like 10 cotton pads worth of baby oil on my eyes
Also me when I splash my face with water to get the exfoliating wash off my face: STILL gets very noticeable streaks of black as soon as the water is wiped off
9501 2018-07-09 01:16:27 EAT MORE: 
- probiotics (kombucha, sauerkraut and pickles) 
- omega 3, fatty acids (salmon and walnuts)
- antioxidants (dark greens and berries) 
- zinc (cashews and almonds) 
EAT LESS:
- coconut oil
- whey protein 
- dairy 
- high glycemic foods

2) Cook up beef with onion and garlic. When browned, add salt and taco seasoning. While that is cooking, add black beans, corn, cherry tomatoes
9503 2018-07-09 01:16:09 Tea tree oil is very drying and my irritate it. Just saline 2-3 times a day is ideal. Make sure it’s dry and that no threads of cotton got stuck to the piercing and it should heal fine
9504 2018-07-09 01:16:07 Fuel prices and their negative consequences would be witnessed around the world leaving the oil exporting nations in the current year. Media men can have a field day (year)
9505 2018-07-09 01:16:07 When they gave that trillion and a half to them it was much more about keeping it away from us
Oil prices soar when you take  oil out of the market and when trillions are handed to the wealthy it's just to make it so Democrats will have nothing to clean up after this catastrophe

9508 2018-07-09 01:15:39 I know  stupid ass me was being all nice. He asked me if he’d call the waxing salon, I told him no, he asked if I knew of a salon where they wax & massage with coco oil, then asked if I use coco oil, my dumbass said yes and that did the trick
9509 2018-07-09 01:15:38 How do you usually serve your kale salad?  I find when I eat kale I kill it with berries, nuts and oil and vinegar, whereas regular salad I just eat plain and enjoy the taste of the salad and all vegetables I chuck in there.

9528 2018-07-09 01:12:47 good point, and they are really busy dropping regulations every day so we may find that its no longer against any regulations to sell natural resources like oil/gas etc to Russia, especially if they get the sanctions dropped.

(The part where Han is constantly on the verge of poverty is a little too real, but.)

Defund corporate subsidies!
9550 2018-07-09 01:09:50 Agreed. During my husband’s career as an engineer in the oil business we lived all over the world. That proclamation is scary..it is slow and steady the creep of darkness. You are correct

9554 2018-07-09 01:09:18 Because olive oil was used for ear aches it was sold by chemist in the 1950's in countries that did not produce it.

I passed on the local olive oil, though. No regrets.

9576 2018-07-09 01:05:07 I used to think “powder my nose” was a euphemism but now that I wear foundation a lot of the time I’ve realized that I do actually have to regularly go to the bathroom and apply translucent powder to my oil slick of a nose so that the center of my face doesn’t just melt off

9583 2018-07-09 01:04:27 In the end, CBD oil didn’t do anything to take away my chronic pain. I don’t know what to do to take care of myself and make myself feel more comfortable. Life is such a bitch.

9593 2018-07-09 01:03:13 They tax O&G at 60%. And most oil is state owned. They have a trillion in the bank.
Are you this ignorant about everything?
9594 2018-07-09 01:03:13 Fun fact: I make my own mayo. I save my bacon grease, add an egg, a squeeze of lemon, and a splash of avocado oil....  With a stick blender is literally takes SECONDS to whip up the BEST condiment known to man: baconaise
9595 2018-07-09 01:03:10 ありがとうございます
9596 2018-07-09 01:03:07 Ambi sis , changed my life !!! ( and tea tree oil )?

9598 2018-07-09 01:02:31 Oil is not decomposed dinosaurs; it's decomposed ocean micro-organisms. We should be able to re-create it from sea water and atmospheric carbon dioxide. ;-)
9599 2018-07-09 01:02:30 So you’re...not gonna go my way?

9608 2018-07-09 01:02:03 It’s incredibly lazy IMO to blame the US for everything wrong with Venezuela. Murder rate, lack of food etc down to gvt only
Chavez was so ideologically driven that he pursued his socialist agenda at the expense of diversifying the economy away from oil

Maduro’s just a lunatic
9609 2018-07-09 01:02:02 Zang. Tbh I’ve never tried making fried chicken. 

MTV true life: I’m afraid of sizzling oil.
9610 2018-07-09 01:02:00 If your skin is dry as well as acne-prone, try an oatmeal mask. The starch in oatmeal absorbs excess oil while also soothing sensitive skin.

9612 2018-07-09 01:01:31 SAME.... like why?!? What happened to my baby oil days?!
9613 2018-07-09 01:01:15 i'm about to make my car run on vegetable oil 
9614 2018-07-09 01:01:05 Listen they use a tiny little candle for the stove and oven on these videos I really just need to know how that gets hot enough to BAKE a cake or heat up some oil. I wonder that every time I watch these
9615 2018-07-09 01:01:01 I remember them selling expired baby formula to underdeveloped countries.
I thought Mars was the last holdout.
They are probably full of palm oil anyway. Sigh.
9616 2018-07-09 01:00:48 It has always been about the sanctions...as long as they are in place, no Dump tower and more importantly, Exxon Mobile and their billions dollar leases for Russian gas and oil. Why do you think we had Tillerson? Who failed ….but the Dumpster continues to pay homage to Putin.
9617 2018-07-09 01:00:47 @mikexingchen love your stuff man! Im trying everything you show Japanese wise! Also do you have a store where i can buy your hot oil and shirts and stuff? I want special chop sticks if you sell those aswell!

9622 2018-07-09 01:00:18 Yes this will bring the USA to their knees, eastern CDN’s stop buying Heinz ketchup but continue to buy billions of $ of oil, gas from the USA. You want to hurt them, buy oil from your own country.
9623 2018-07-09 01:00:11 Imagine if Israel had discovered all that oil.

9627 2018-07-09 00:59:41 Very clever. Call it to mind and then define “others.” FO, you and your call-girl clients. I’d never vote for you. Snake oil.

9634 2018-07-09 00:59:08 If the Cabinet heavyweights don’t act in the morning but simply pour oil on troubled waters, the massive opportunity that Davis has proffered will be blown away and we’ll return to the abysmally failing EU dialogue, which was like watching pigeons feed.

9639 2018-07-09 00:57:58 Good thing that Donny demanding nobody import any Iranian oil won’t make the supply situation worse

9642 2018-07-09 00:57:46 I was gonna say this but I didn’t want to sound cliche. I can out olive oil on anything.

9647 2018-07-09 00:57:05 Why does no one intervene in this bloodshed?? Because there is no oil in Nicaragua like Iraq and Siria? Maybe Is because of the Russian satellite station in Managua..
9648 2018-07-09 00:56:58 Reminds me of Max Max, Road Warrior where the ppl trapped inside the refinery are arguing about whether or not to take Humongus' offer of 'safe passage' out of the wasteland if they just walk away from their gas/oil.
9649 2018-07-09 00:56:58 #IranUpdate,After allowing Israel to target IRGC bases in Syria,Russia has also decided to side with Saudi Arabia in terms of pumping more oil into the market.Iranian newspapers call this move “an anti Iranian alliance”.
Iran is shocked&some newspapers described it as “betrayal.”
9650 2018-07-09 00:56:57 What! don’t ever say an unkind word about my favorite Jewish African American artist.
9651 2018-07-09 00:56:46 Try putting some baby oil on them - it will help avoid irritation issues...
9652 2018-07-09 00:56:39 It would be a lot better for you if they didn’t strip the peanut oil and replace it with canola oil and sugar.  I once read a study that said women who ate peanut butter had larger breasts .. duh at 585 cal. Per 100g they also had bigger butts.
9653 2018-07-09 00:56:33 Emtee was empty inside because he mixed nyaope,oil and boiling water
9654 2018-07-09 00:56:07 You oversimplify a complex subject. My first cousin went to SA in 1968 with ARAMCO. At that time offshore and arctic drilling were unfeasible. We became addicted to cheap oil, building gas guzzlers for cars. Now Trump supporters oppose the only reasonable alternative: renewable!
9655 2018-07-09 00:55:38 おつかれさま〜。おやすみなさいませ！
9656 2018-07-09 00:55:34 @unspokenwordsx1 when you friend those biscuits like we talked about before, after you flattened them did they still puff back up in the oil?
9657 2018-07-09 00:55:16 I’ve literally done my brakes, my battery and I need an oil change all in ONE week 
9658 2018-07-09 00:55:16 The USA now goes in full swing to stop Countries like India, China and Turkey to get oil from Iran. This will lead to lot of events and of course it will have a hidden agenda of privatization of PSU oil & refinery companies.
9659 2018-07-09 00:55:16 That’s when you put oil on something to prevent friction!
9660 2018-07-09 00:55:14 our entire apartment smells like burnt oil thanks to whatever the neighbors are cooking

9664 2018-07-09 00:54:50 Reminds me a lot like bitcoin. The small group of early pioneers did all the great stuff. The Johnny-Come-Lately preachers are mostly snake oil salesmen. Especially with the SAFe and LeSS smoke and mirrors.
9665 2018-07-09 00:54:39 Get a romaine lettuce, toss it in olive oil with some minced garlic salt and pepper throw it on the grill till it’s a little blackened, take it off put the dressing and some fresh shredded parm. It will change your life

9668 2018-07-09 00:54:09 In some peanut butter the natural oil is replaced with palm oil. 
That's not good. Not good for orangutans or Indonesia, or for the planet. 
But the real stuff is GOOOOD !

9671 2018-07-09 00:54:04 Any clay mask with apple cider vinegar. Use a toner or astringent to get the dirt from deep in your pores. And use oils and serums at night. I use jojoba oil and a vitamin c serum

Remember 
The price of oil will  over $200 when you decide to take a stupid action in the golf area
9680 2018-07-09 00:52:46 I don't Know why there are so fearful about the Iran oil, there are more Electric cars now and are growing, so the combustion cars are starting to finish
9681 2018-07-09 00:52:42 Really need to get my oil changed
9682 2018-07-09 00:52:36 Get some natural beard oil. Can't stress this enough. Softens it beyond belief.
9683 2018-07-09 00:52:28 Source?  Not that there weren't, but evidence that it was nearly as bad as afterwards?

Further, if communism is so great, why didn't it fix it?

And lastly, why are those hunger problems now in Venezuela - an oil rich country that didn't have them before?

9688 2018-07-09 00:51:46 It doesn’t say that either. It doesn’t say anything about oil like you claimed, and it doesn’t say that solar and coal are equal in terms of emissions.

9725 2018-07-09 00:47:02 Idk how you're cooking it but cooking with butter and chicken broth will guarantee a moist and cooked, then sear the chicken in a separate ban with a lil oil or smthn until a caramel tone. Also if it's lemon garlic, season before during and after. Squeeze the lemon in broth*

9740 2018-07-09 00:44:10 I’m so excited to go back home to my coconut oil and shea butter 
9741 2018-07-09 00:44:06 Mathew, oil flows freely to market unmolested everywhere but BC, including in tankers from Alaska through the Salish Sea into the state of Washington.  I think we are capable of moving oil just as safely if not more so than anyone else in the world.
9742 2018-07-09 00:43:49 Today i learned how to change my cars oil. Safe to call me a mechanic now.
9743 2018-07-09 00:43:45 actually get Kenny Kravitz to play music for the people in GITMO, this would get us what info we need from them. :D
9744 2018-07-09 00:43:39 That olive oil looks spicy
9745 2018-07-09 00:43:30 What's the best essential oil diffuser I can buy? Not too expensive though. I need some oils in my life after this surgery on the 19th #ineedhealing lol

9748 2018-07-09 00:43:05 My baby 1st solid food.. bubur nasi kosong + evoo (extra virgin olive oil) 
9749 2018-07-09 00:43:04 If accounting doesn’t work out I want my next job to be the person who gets to clean ducks and otters affected by oil spills. #becky #dawndish
9750 2018-07-09 00:42:39 Story time: so my mom wants Mango(my dog) to have health skin so she held him down and rubbed olive oil all over him. This dog goes on the new carpet and starts rolling and rubbing the oil off all over her carpet lmaaooo. This dog never lost in his life I swear
9751 2018-07-09 00:42:31 In Venezuela, their change in policy in oil crippled their economy as well as corruption and undermining capitalism, this doesn’t equate to socialism but Venezuela’s shitty government that gives no shits for its people
9752 2018-07-09 00:42:18 I love oil pulling! It’s the shit!
9753 2018-07-09 00:42:10 I got sick of the #data as #oil meta phors, not comfortable with the #data as capital metaphor, don't buy the #data as labor metaphor but agree with the solutions!  Kudos Weyl Lanier etc...
9754 2018-07-09 00:41:54 You used this data & similar to claim wind and solar ALWAYS raise electricity rates. First as US Chamber points out HI's electricity rates are down 7 cents per kWh since 2014. Chamber says "cost effective renewables" and oil price declines are why. Starting/Ending points matter
9755 2018-07-09 00:41:28 I was always of the impression that gasoline prices were based on oil prices.
9756 2018-07-09 00:40:50 My goal is to make this house chemical free one essential oil at a time.
9757 2018-07-09 00:40:37 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
9758 2018-07-09 00:40:37 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9760 2018-07-09 00:40:23 My coworker said I probably lied about being 20 on my car replaced and an oil change just in time to get some thai food soon.

9763 2018-07-09 00:40:05 People don't like to admit they have been duped, and so they double down on the beliefs to justify it to themselves. It's the sort of thing which has kept carnies, snake oil salesmen, magicians and politicians in business for a long time.

9765 2018-07-09 00:39:44 Hi, I'm kickstarting a crude oil startup, we're seeking $20 billion to do some basic colonisation with a stretch goal of exploratory drilling in Alaska
9766 2018-07-09 00:39:43 if she only use coconut oil SHE A FLIRT
9767 2018-07-09 00:39:41 Well, we buy oil from Saudi Arabia and it’s a fairly easy connection between the Saudi’s and a number of terrorist groups.
9768 2018-07-09 00:39:34 Thanks for making today's Shitty Cooking LIVE such a fun experience. Unreal support and we only ruined 75% of the food. 

Time to clean up the broken plates, lettuce blender, and spilled oil...
9769 2018-07-09 00:39:31 Would come down to Trump. Would he let Merkel get away with it? Doubtful on level of personal psychology and bargaining meta-strategy for any future issues.
Just like I think Haley's opinion on Chabahar and Iranian oil for India is just her opinion. (But that's only my opinion.)
9770 2018-07-09 00:39:29 I added more oil and placed a plate over the pot instead of a lid. My grandma would do that.
9771 2018-07-09 00:39:14 It amazes me that he thinks that Gangbangers have filled out ATF form 4473's, and that digitizing them would help.

9775 2018-07-09 00:38:41 I need a hair mask but I'm allergic to cocoa butter and coconut oil. Basically, if it came from the coconut, i cant have it. Does anyone have any recommendations?
9776 2018-07-09 00:38:22 You correctly say the oil sands tailing ponds cover 77 sq km but show a map of Alberta with a large swath of brown. I call BS. Calgary’s footprint alone is 826 sq km and it’s just a wee dot on the map. @PipelineAction @CanadaAction nice try Mike. @crazycdn123
9777 2018-07-09 00:38:16 Its been so hot in Los Angeles that the streets of SilverLake are covered in beard oil that's dripped off our Hipsters.
9778 2018-07-09 00:38:09 everyday im either drenched in coconut oil or shea butter or both 
9779 2018-07-09 00:37:49 Tea Tree oil is acc wonderful but I’m just too impatient
9780 2018-07-09 00:37:49 Oh no I don’t want to go to the beach, I want to go to an oil factory. #RHOP

9782 2018-07-09 00:37:38 so you want to fry some cookies? go ahead try it with oil hahahahahahahahahahah
9783 2018-07-09 00:37:21 Britain doesn't care like the French in their former colonies, unless the oil price goes up to 100$ per barrel. Also Britain handed over to the Muslims at the time of independence.
9784 2018-07-09 00:36:54 Oh yes.. virgin coconut oil 
9785 2018-07-09 00:36:43 Nothing worse than driving home from the cottage while the race is taping..staying off anything near highlights cuz you know the race is over.But to get home and watch that Arrow  Awesome!Great job team !And that pass for the lead..sweet!Congrats!Bring on @hondaindy
9786 2018-07-09 00:36:34 Billions is also pretty ignorant there, bro. Same thing with "main source of cheap energy". Coal is in decline because gas is cheaper, way cheaper, bro. While he's rubbing coal's dick, he's taking it up the ass from the oil industry. If you're going to whore, know who is on top.
9787 2018-07-09 00:36:30 "dying industry"? Oil consumption around the world is increasing more each year...if that's the industry you're talking about.
9788 2018-07-09 00:36:24 i put coconut oil in my hair bc it’s supposed to help with softness?? but anyways it looks as oily as kevin’s hair
9789 2018-07-09 00:36:16 Some celebs draw funny faces or mustaches on themselves or make it mandatory to personalize autographs to make them less appealing for resale. Though apparently there's some kind of oil the sellers use to remove names! It is crazy.
9790 2018-07-09 00:36:13 I love to put bio oil all over my face 
9791 2018-07-09 00:36:09 What trade?

If it's gold.silver. coal or oil.. 
.What's the debt from

9792 2018-07-09 00:36:09 I yelled/said hi to an old high school mate but he looked so fuckng terrified im dead I hope i didnt scare him tok badly
9793 2018-07-09 00:36:07 Why are we paying more for a liter of gas today than when the price for a barrel of oil was double today's price??

9803 2018-07-09 00:34:18 I'm afraid, if and when oil companies get pushed out by alternative energy, the economy will tank due to over investment in energy stocks. Many investment and retirement portfolios are heavily invested.
9804 2018-07-09 00:34:12 Eggs, mayo & olive oil deep condition  should I do it tonight or in two weeks when I get a sew in ?
9805 2018-07-09 00:33:55 If ada irritation, maybe your skin is sensitive or the product itself tak sesuai. Try cari product for sensitive skin. And for tiny bumps buat double cleanse. For oil based yang xde mineral oil, you can try simple or hadalabo cleansing oil. I hope I answer your question.

9809 2018-07-09 00:33:10 How is that oil price looking since you cut off the Iran supply?  How many American jobs lost?  How many american families reducing their ability to buy things besides gas?  Iran restarting a nuclear program ?    Millions of Americans are now suffering because of your actions !

9815 2018-07-09 00:32:38 I sort of made it up. 
Chop 1 yellow onion and 4 cloves of garlic, sautée that in olive oil, add 16
oz chicken broth, meat from 1 roast chicken, cook that on med. for a 1/2 hr.  6 stalks of celery and 6 carrots and 1 bag Tuscan kale. Salt, pepper, red pepper flakes.

Light the charcoal and keep it in the middle of the grill.

Preheat a cast iron skillet over the coals.

Once preheated put oil in and get to temp

Add popcorn and salt.

9832 2018-07-09 00:30:01 Don't forget endless wars. At least they stopped mumbling about democracy and admitted that it's about "US having a voice in the region" (Koreas) and protecting Syrian oil fields from Syrian government

9837 2018-07-09 00:29:13 Best thing about the heat is that my coconut oil has been in a  permanently liquid state for for three weeks now.

9843 2018-07-09 00:27:58 This is something I just cannot understand. People are constantly saying scientists have a financial conflict of interest when it comes to climate science (with no evidence). Yet they ignore the undeniable evidence of the COI from big oil companies going against climate science.
9844 2018-07-09 00:27:48 That's very true. Oil is used for so much more than just energy and transport though.

9862 2018-07-09 00:25:01 Hello :)
Dua-dua tu boleh jadi kemungkinan. Kalau nak lebih bersih, cuba guna cleansing oil with microfiber towel (tutorial boleh tengok di ig @iffahs_ ). Kalau nothing really changes, kemungkinan tidak sesuai ataupun mungkin perlu extra step eg: exfoliation, hydration

9873 2018-07-09 00:23:50 Oh, okay. Or it might’ve been that they started hyping that benefit up because they wanted to lure more people to the state to boost productivity and stuff. Like how Florida & Texas hyped up “no state taxes.” But yeah, I know it came about because of the oil thing you mentioned.
9874 2018-07-09 00:23:47 Because we are all stinking hot and need something simple for dinner.

Combine 3 cubed tomatoes and a can of black olives in a bowl.  Sprinkle with garlic salt, basil, and oregano to taste.  Hit it with a bit of olive oil and either balsamic vinegar or lemon juice. 1/2

9878 2018-07-09 00:23:40 THIS is the content I appreciate. Also, I have oily/sensitive skin and salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide spot treatments are way too harsh on my skin, so I use tea tree oil to help dry up spots and i really like it if you’re ever looking for a natural spot treatment!
9879 2018-07-09 00:23:37 Read my blog post on coconut oil bowls. Full info is in my book. Namaste.
9880 2018-07-09 00:23:34 I have bad arthritis in my lower back but with CBD Oil once daily I can function normally. Something no prescriptions have been able to do,not to mention the side effects. No side effects from CBD  Oil.
9881 2018-07-09 00:23:33 Stuart, can you recommend any reliable articles about canola oil?  Got in a discussion with a friend who is convinced canola is a danger to health, and there sure appears to be a multitude of websites circulating that claim.
9882 2018-07-09 00:23:26 I tried all of them - Castor oil, argon oil, and am now using the tea tree oil shampoo and conditioner.  I like the Argon oil one the best, but the Tea Tree oil shampoo helps with my itchy scalp.
9883 2018-07-09 00:23:24 Dear coconut oil during traveling in the summer: you ruin everything and I hate you but also I love you please never leave me and take this makeup off my face for a low price cost
9884 2018-07-09 00:22:56 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
9885 2018-07-09 00:22:53 Sure. Curbs on H1B visas, sanctions under CAATSA for weapons procurement, case in WTO against minimum support prices in agriculture, tariffs against Indian commodities, restrictions on oil from Iran, and lately, sermons on the need to relook relations with Iran and Russia...
9886 2018-07-09 00:22:18 I think it's definitely helping. I've been putting it on a cold wet rag, letting it dry and then using aloe. I read somewhere that you can use coconut oil instead of aloe too
9887 2018-07-09 00:22:17 Without oil, there's no Coast Guard, so I wouldn't cut either one. Now ask me what I would cut and I'd start with @PPFA @PBS @NIH etc....
9888 2018-07-09 00:22:08  CBD oil works wonders
9889 2018-07-09 00:22:04 Pour into the oil until golden.
9890 2018-07-09 00:22:01 “Cook right minutes on each side.”
Oh I’m sorry I thought you said cook one side accidentally for fifteen minutes, frantically flip it over, and accidentally drip boiling oil onto your toe.
Folks, I *might* be bad at cooking.
9891 2018-07-09 00:21:32 The smell of coconut oil is overwhelmingly pleasant.

9893 2018-07-09 00:21:15 ExxonMobil is the most profitable corporation in the history of the world. You are knocking CLIMATE SCIENCE as some kind of profit machine? That’s why all of those oil execs are fleeing to academia, right? Ridiculous shit!!

9895 2018-07-09 00:21:07 The ones that are family I kind of have to deal with them....the ones that are friends....I keep around to troll when it all goes in the shitter...which is soon....and there’s been a ton of warnings he’s leaking oil....they’re even starting to question him....but not all of them
9896 2018-07-09 00:20:56 Airports. Architectural monoculture par excellence. And yet each one is sprinkled with the maddening essential oil of its city. Few places distill NYC better than Kennedy, CDG que Paris, yvr than Vancouver etc -- in every case, it's always oh jeeze get me outta here.
9897 2018-07-09 00:20:55 How it really works as simple OPEC sets the price of a barrel of oil and all the members of OPEC sell it for that amount the higher the price the higher the price of gas. Vote Trump can get his buddies in Saudi Arabia to sell its oil cheaper
9898 2018-07-09 00:20:55 Everyone shits on Naturopaths. I don’t get it. Yeah, some of them are snake oil salesmen. But certainly not all of them! Many are caring health practitioners that are helping people through difficult health issues. I adore  my Naturopaths. It’s about using discernment.
9899 2018-07-09 00:20:52 glutino rosemary and olive oil are great if u need ideas of what kind to get!

9906 2018-07-09 00:20:25 Whatever it is the Chinese call Shen energy is also delightful. Both the movements that seem to bring it on, as well as the substances that nourish it... such as the triterpenes from good Ling Zhi (Reishi) mushroom caps and spores.

Reishi spore oil was really next level.
9907 2018-07-09 00:20:22 Rosemary oil! Dilute with Olive oil or coconut. I use a 1:1 ratio for active sinus infections and rub directly around the nose #rhop #notforlazymoms
9908 2018-07-09 00:20:13 小学生の時、担任の先生が入院してクラスで千羽鶴を折ろうってことになった時、クラスの嫌われ者だった私には黒い折り紙が50枚ほど配られ、手先が不器用なりに一生懸命折ったのに「黒は縁起が悪いから」ってごみ箱に捨てられた時、子供なりに「善意って自己満足なんだな」って悟ったんだ。

9911 2018-07-09 00:20:00 America now feels the right to let the poor die, children taken away from their families, all based on money and skin color and you think oil? Thats also part of it. America is now a shameful legacy for humanity. Fuck oil and money. We are people.
9912 2018-07-09 00:19:50 Probably oil, but I prefer to say i’s a water rainbow
9913 2018-07-09 00:19:49 unbelievable. we can be bought by anyone. I knew about NRA and oil industry buying politiicans, I just never knew that infant formula could also buy our administration.

9921 2018-07-09 00:18:52 Thank you Ward. I appreciate your faith in me. I just have to figure out how much of my sensitive flesh I’m willing to give up to hot searing cooking oil for tasty Japanese style fried chicken.
9922 2018-07-09 00:18:48 usually i get balsamic vinegar and olive oil as dressing and its good with everything
9923 2018-07-09 00:18:41 You know how dangerous lithium mines are to the environment? Compare an oil well or a coal mine to a lithium mine that uses the lithium for electric cars and other "environmentally safe" things, and you'll have a heart attack.

9940 2018-07-09 00:15:26 Dermot I have SPMS and often have chronic nerve pain, but like you I refuse to take pain killers (too many of them bring a multitude of dubious side effects). 
I take CBD oil to help ease the pain when it’s at its worst, it’s very effective, also helps to ease spasticity.

9945 2018-07-09 00:13:54 When Trump tweets, it’s proven to be a lie.He lies directly to your face.He didn’t get the Saudis to create more oil, there’s no deal with NK, he knew about Stormy Daniels payment, his inaug crowd wasn’t the biggest ever.I take offense to the “president” lying to the people.

9947 2018-07-09 00:13:53 Their father built the first oil refinery in the Soviet Union. Kochs and Russia are like peanut butter and jelly.
9948 2018-07-09 00:13:21 Seth, dude....drilling for our own oil makes oil cheaper to sell to our allies, which also causes the ability of Russia to sell their oil more difficult.  Russians hate that and puts them against our president.  They would love to have Hillary the pawn in office.

9954 2018-07-09 00:11:57 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.

9958 2018-07-09 00:11:19 So true! I just embraced that essence serum life and my oil slick of a face is now just a little cookin oil - that’s about all I can hope for in this swampy southeast summer.
9959 2018-07-09 00:11:12 Dude. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a crushing defeat. So brutal.
9960 2018-07-09 00:10:48 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
9961 2018-07-09 00:10:41 Think they put a gun in out hand when we are born here in WV. And use gun oil on us instead of baby oil!

9968 2018-07-09 00:09:51 The United States were leading producers of oil I believe for the last two years. Why do we need oil again from anywhere else? What happened to the Keystone Pipeline being so essential for the US to become oil independent?

9972 2018-07-09 00:08:56 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
9973 2018-07-09 00:08:47 Make sure you don’t put them directly on the skin without a carrier oil like Monique just did. They need to be diluted 
9974 2018-07-09 00:08:39 Industrials of the market & most of the rest is held up by the Oil scam collaboration as the U.S. framer get ready to bend over part each cheek in greased & get misused for poor trade tariff business America created  !?!
9975 2018-07-09 00:08:34 Do you drive to work? Gas prices up! Had my oil changed yesterday and paid $16 more than I did 3 months ago. Prices on many grocery items up. Going to get worse with tarrifs. Project car prices to go up approximately $2,000-$5,000 per car. Building materials going up.
9976 2018-07-09 00:08:24 Haven't listened yet but is his opinion that truffle oil is the worst and should be banned? Because that's the only truffle oil opinion I can support.

9978 2018-07-09 00:08:10 My mother-in-law gave me a bottle of Strawberry Lemonade Vodka on Friday and let me tell you how much it has changed my life: my crops are flourishing,  we have found so much gold in the mines, and we struck oil this morning. I am living a blessed life. Goodbye twitter.

9983 2018-07-09 00:07:36 Aw man! My fav way to eat kale is in a super lemony and raw garlic dressing. Let the garlic sit in the lemon juice and olive oil for as long as you can stand. Then, toss and let it sit to break the kale down a bit, sprinkle on an avalanche of Parm, add toasted pine nuts.

9985 2018-07-09 00:07:27 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
9986 2018-07-09 00:07:14 I think cars are listening to our thoughts too. I was thinking about checking how much longer I have until an oil change is due, immediately the "check oil" light pops up at 6871 miles. #bigbrother
9987 2018-07-09 00:07:07 Remember that when your water is poisoned by a corporation dumping toxins, the air is filled with fumes, you lose your worker benefits, schools are defunded,  national parks are sold off to oil companies, prices for cars, food, building supplies, etc., rise die to trump tariffs.
9988 2018-07-09 00:06:51 Day 8 of the #Whole30. Lots of fruit,  olive oil, taters, and cheap, pan-seared steak. What I refer to as "old sailor meat".

9990 2018-07-09 00:06:27 UR wrong as usual.  He's killed Russians in Syria, authorized drilling for oil in Alaska so it would be cheaper for our allies that Russian oil and other things against what they want.  Obama sold them nuclear material.  They hate Trump.  They just want you to help hate Trump.

9992 2018-07-09 00:06:18 You must have or know someone who has an invested iterest in oil companies. I’d like to check out you and your entire support network for oil investments. It must be the root of your cause.

9995 2018-07-09 00:05:48 The problem here lies in the district that elected Nunez. Highly conservative with strong ties to oil. That equates to a good chance even the smarmiest Of smarmy will be re-elected.
9996 2018-07-09 00:05:36 If there’s oil under it, count on it defintely happening.

9999 2018-07-09 00:05:09 No it was Obama who shut down drilling and pipelines making us more dependent on foreign oil. Capitalism saved us by coming up with fracking and Obama tried to shut that down too
