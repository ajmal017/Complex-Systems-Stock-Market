I can answer specific questions, walk you through the platform, point out some videos, etc. Let's make this an awesome week!
1 2018-11-12 23:59:15 I'm focusing on rifles specifically because of their higher muzzle velocity, larger capacity & accessories like bump stocks. Daily I run into people, hell even on this thread that are so quick to anger, have such a low amount of self control, that these shooting are inevitable
2 2018-11-12 23:58:59 Tech stocks tumble. Not "thu stock market".
3 2018-11-12 23:58:34 When the jobless rate is down, then the fluctuation of  stock market is not a thing to be worried.
First, stock market down is a helpful thing to keep down inflation!
Second, most stock holders are not poor, they can live well without selling stocks!
4 2018-11-12 23:57:38 Old news stocks plummet, mens leg hair, they dont cut it
5 2018-11-12 23:57:34 Corrections are never that easy to get through.. Hang in there while it works through the system. Still risk off sellers in the market. We need some clarity on trade and the Fed for the market to move higher... #stocks
6 2018-11-12 23:56:43 I'm not paid by anyone to advocate for #vaccines much less pharma and I don't own their stocks.  You've yet to establish that EtHg in vaccine thimerosal is "toxic" and have ignored the science/data that demonstrates you are wrong in favor of a porky pig case report.

9 2018-11-12 23:55:15 She is gonna trip and cough her way to the top. Just like our economy is about to do except it's going the other way with Dems in charge.  Stocks down 600 pts. and this is day one. Lookout lower and lower middle class Americans.  We are screwed....
10 2018-11-12 23:54:51 @LGUSAMobile SHAME ON YOU for using zombies in your commercials. They're ugly, falling apart and NOT fun or funny. Is that really how you want to depict your products: Ugly, falling apart, not fun? Fire the person who thought up these commercials. #Dow #stocks

13 2018-11-12 23:52:50 Then the 4th down "Alex" in which h he threw to the stocks and could certainly argue if not bobbled was a first down but ultimately comes up as short of chains no? Everything in stats are hollow when just looking at numbers and not actual game film and eyes/ critical thinking

36 2018-11-12 23:49:58 I’ve made 10 cents in my stocks so far, I feel like a pimp now. LMAO. Wtf is wrong w me??
37 2018-11-12 23:49:17 Quality stocks are out there so too early to discourage new investment in dips. Do analysis on stocks and then buy at dip. Longterm time frame is best for stock market investing. I started in ‘87 when the market crashed—everyone thought I was nuts but the quality stocks pay off!
38 2018-11-12 23:49:02 I don't trade stocks yet, However I do follow @traderstewie for his chart analysis. Guess I will have to check out @HulkCapital as well. Nice trade
39 2018-11-12 23:48:06 Stocks rebounded in the middle of the year but have swooned again because investors are worried about rising rates -— and a mountain of debt caused by the tax cut bill that higher rates will make more expensive to pay off.
40 2018-11-12 23:47:18 Bago pa ako maubusan titikman ko na po  Sa mga magpapareserve pm is the key  
Limited Stocks only

Buy 2 for 280, 
Buy 3 for 390 
Buy 1 Box for only 720 
41 2018-11-12 23:47:06 Ya but u put economy in jeapordy stocks are probably gonna finish minus for the year they be already been in minus side a couple times everything from milk to toilet paper costs more because of you plus made America unsafe again where Supreme Court guy won’t walk the steps
42 2018-11-12 23:46:57 America could make much more money by sticking Trump in some stocks, and charging people to throw rotten vegatables at him. I'd pay for that pleasure!
43 2018-11-12 23:46:41 From the view of a small business that imports from EU. Been having massive issues getting enough stock through, UK companies not holding large stocks due to fluctuations in the £. This has been going on since referendum!!!!! Get us out, No Deal, do it now before anymore chaos!
44 2018-11-12 23:45:52 Barnes is behind Carmelo on the Player Rater and watching him it reminds me of when he came back a bit slow from injuries with the Warriors (15/16 I think?), but his role/usage is still better than Grant's. JG mostly a "stocks" (stl+blk) dude. Option 2 for me.
45 2018-11-12 23:45:51 That's why stocks sold off. Stock market doesn't like a strong dollar these days.
46 2018-11-12 23:45:46 Michael Milken gave an interview a few weeks ago and he said that there's a lot more "blue chip" stocks out there w similar problems to GE that will be getting a lot worse over the next 5-10 years
47 2018-11-12 23:45:20 Lost a heck of a lot of money in stocks too.
48 2018-11-12 23:44:13 Well we could use the ancient stocks system, throw him in and tour the country 

Sunshine or rain
49 2018-11-12 23:44:11 SOCIAL SOLIDARITY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
50 2018-11-12 23:44:04 Interesting!
In the #crypto space with so many options of #cryptocurrencies to invest in or get involved with.#hashpower and overall network security is an important factor for the coin's value. Like how earnings are important for the value of stocks.
51 2018-11-12 23:43:29 Abigail - This was a GREAT call from a couple of days ago. #spy #trading #stocks
52 2018-11-12 23:43:06 According to Trump, stocks tanked because the market just discovered that the Dems flipped the house six days ago.
53 2018-11-12 23:43:03 3 stocks

54 2018-11-12 23:42:41 I wonder how many billions holders of the stocks in the companies named gained or lost in response to your tweet. Curious what caused this tweet, who did you speak with and investment decisions made after. Should the President be picking winners and loosers. dangerous & careless.
55 2018-11-12 23:41:09 Donny logic.  when stocks are up, it’s only because of Donny.  When stocks are down, blame everyone else.   #shutupdonny @realDonaldTrump
56 2018-11-12 23:41:08 And to clarify about stocks, I am not in agreement with how they ended up the way they are. Deregulation to the point of poisoning environment or encouraging corruption with lack of oversight is not ok with me.
57 2018-11-12 23:40:28 What, some of your stocks drop?
58 2018-11-12 23:40:20 Talk about #FakeNews the stocks are bad because of the tech and oil markets.  Ask an economist before you fear monger. You will end up causing violence towards us Dems and then you will laugh.  You are the worst president ever.
59 2018-11-12 23:38:55 Today with S&P dn 2% my portfolio entirely in ETFs 65% in Reits 35% in. Global stocks dn only 0.73%. Every quarter I earn $5,000 in dividends mostly from Reits.
60 2018-11-12 23:38:21 It’s no wonder so many businesses you were involved with had to declare bankruptcy, you don’t understand the first thing about the stock market. Today’s sell off was due to trouble with the FANG stocks, primarily Apple. BTW some of its troubles relate to your trade war.
61 2018-11-12 23:37:35 My stocks are up that’s about all. Not surprising but not confident it’s sustainable. And not fair to the millions who don’t have a 401K. Jury is out until tax time about savings there since I’ll no longer have state/ local tax deductions. Plus with tariffs, things cost more too.
62 2018-11-12 23:36:42 @jimcramer cloud stocks my ass
63 2018-11-12 23:36:27 Well, it's a little like how most brokers pick stocks: she loves me, she loves me not, she loves me..., then pick!
64 2018-11-12 23:36:00 Our stocks are erratic as well, but that's probably pretty well covered.
65 2018-11-12 23:35:46 If Cramer is really worth $100 million (or whatever) then 80% stocks is okay for himself, since he could live off just the interest on the other 20 million, but the guy in his 50's from the audience probably doesn't have that kind of luxury.
66 2018-11-12 23:35:32 didnt he also say there would be a ban on "bump stocks"
67 2018-11-12 23:35:20 3 stocks

69 2018-11-12 23:34:57 because an average person with an average salary shouldn't have to invest in stocks & bonds in order to preserve their wealth if their salary is paid in sound money...
70 2018-11-12 23:32:37 Girlfriend trying to convince me that investing in "toe sock stocks" is not a good choice, no matter how awesome it sounds.
71 2018-11-12 23:32:35 #A1News at 6:30pm ET
CBS: Whitaker (CA fires A2)

ABC: CA fires, human interest angle
CNN: stocks falling
Y!: Lee obit
NYT: Khashoggi
WaPo: Trump tweets re: FL (Stan Lee obit A2)
72 2018-11-12 23:32:25 an average person’s NEED to save by investing in stocks and bonds is REDUCED in a world where actual hard sound money exists
73 2018-11-12 23:32:05 Stocks soared up more than 500 points the day after Dems won back the House.

If Trump's claims were true, they would have crashed then, not a week later.
74 2018-11-12 23:31:56 BOI I SHOULD'VE JUST DONATED 85% OF MY EARNINGS DANG IT

WALA NA KONG CAPITAL 

I MEAN

ANG LIIT TO START STOCKS AND CRYPTO AGAIN POOOTAAAAAAAA
75 2018-11-12 23:31:28 That is if we're talking tezzla
Stocks in general...yeah probably lower I guess
76 2018-11-12 23:31:20 This is only an opinion, but if it were me, I would put it all into dividend yielding stocks.
77 2018-11-12 23:30:58 Don't worry. The stocks will go up when the FBI arrest you and your criminal organization for fraud, treason, accessory to crime, etc...
78 2018-11-12 23:30:15 I'm pro-gun, but I'm not pro-stupid.

There are very easy steps that could be taken to prevent incidents.

1. Raise buying age to 21
2. Background checks (have to be thoroughly vetted by a panel)
3. Bump stocks allowed only for armed services
79 2018-11-12 23:29:24 To our Esteemed Customers:
Sorry to let you know we are running out of stocks til 17th  November 2018, Please Bear with us.
80 2018-11-12 23:28:31 @NancyPelosi Hello, ma'am. It's a pleasure to meet you. I am Mr. Nick. I have a couple of big favor to ask of you; First off please don't tell anyone about me. Second, I really need the Democrats to hold off on any talk about action towards Trump. At least until stocks are better
81 2018-11-12 23:27:53 When stocks are up: "The stock market is the economy"

When stocks are down: "It's just a minor blip. Nothing to see here"
82 2018-11-12 23:26:50 Bought a few different stocks and I can’t wait to be a billionaire
83 2018-11-12 23:26:28 Aaaaa good shit, let's hope Nintendo actually stocks them and makes a good supply of them tho lmfao
84 2018-11-12 23:25:42 Whatever you’re being supplied with tonight, could the Swedish engineer ensure that stocks never run low ?
85 2018-11-12 23:25:29 Saving is great. But people who focus strictly on the value of the currency, and refuse to take into account things like interest from savings accounts, bonds, or stocks are essentially asking for a free lunch: wealth preservation with zero risks.
86 2018-11-12 23:25:09 Heard on the radio that their stocks dropped today.
87 2018-11-12 23:25:00 Yay! Screwing Zuck Face - Facebook shares close at lowest price since April 2017 as tech stocks plunge.
88 2018-11-12 23:24:55 Plunge was last night's word, risk was dumped on most fronts. 
#US30 -565
#AUDUSD -46
#EURJPY -122
#Gold extended lower dropping $9.50 and #Oil gave up a healthy lead to finish 100+ cents lower. taking it to 11 consecutive losses in a row.  
#trading #forex #stocks.
89 2018-11-12 23:24:54 Cameron and Osborne should be ashamed of themselves but they will be OK no matter what happens. They should be put in the stocks in Parliament Square and pelted with rotten EU tomatoes#be ashamed
90 2018-11-12 23:24:41 Biotech investors learn the hard way when they see the stock price drop below cash...it happens all the time.  Stocks are forward looking.  Occam’s razor:  what’s more likely? $SGMO runs out of cash or they cure a disease at the genetic level?
91 2018-11-12 23:24:24 Yes, I'm sure he will be telling everyone to go back to 100% stocks at higher prices.
92 2018-11-12 23:22:17 Cramer is 80% stocks 20% cash, and advising someone in his 50s, in the audience, to go from 100% stocks to maybe 90% stocks, 10% cash.   :)
93 2018-11-12 23:22:12 The experts already know the real reasons-diminishing stocks in the tech market and the tariffs against China (which YOU enacted)-you're just doing your usual 'blame the other guy-i.e. the Democrats' thing again-You screwed up-admit it
94 2018-11-12 23:22:11 i guess they want to clear stocks....lelz
95 2018-11-12 23:21:38 Yea, their finance page, it used to be really useful. Picture this, you could enter stocks & purchase prices and it would track it for you. Was easy to use, view & navigate or add stocks to. Now its just a regular ol' ho-hum page.
96 2018-11-12 23:21:31 Stocks and bank interest would still have a real return.
97 2018-11-12 23:21:23 Dude, idk if you knew this already, but I just found out SS allows you to choose the same character for all stocks if you want. I'd still personally advocate for players NOT to be able to do this, but if they could, does that change your opinion on the format?

99 2018-11-12 23:20:02 Maybe stocks are collapsing world wide today because the tRUmp WH is filled with insider traders who are exercising their options. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I'll bet a record amount of money was funneled into offshore accounts today.

101 2018-11-12 23:18:45 Because the saver, who wishes to preserve their purchasing power over time, is essentially engaging in time travel. So you have to pay for that one way or another, with volatility risk (stocks), counterparty risk (banks) or property risk (land, hard assets and so forth)
102 2018-11-12 23:18:24 Stocks got knocked down off of a strong dollar and Italian banks today..the market behaved like a monolithic object....does not reflect ISM data whatsoever.

#stocks. #daytrading #stockcharts
105 2018-11-12 23:16:13 Hold up...Squad Strike allows you to choose one character for all stocks? Okay, seriously, this SHOULD be the format. It's still gonna look like singles 90% of the time, but letting solo mains stay solo while still letting in 3-character lineups just seems objectively right.
106 2018-11-12 23:15:38 You lost a couple of bucks and stocks are down . Stop treating your people like slaves  Darth  Bezos . The dark side is consuming you . You are traveling a path that the world will not follow
107 2018-11-12 23:15:18 One of my friends is making money from bed in stocks and another is going to the Latin Grammys. In conclusion my friends are cool af.
108 2018-11-12 23:13:46 apple stocks rise by 35%.
109 2018-11-12 23:13:42 You seen that on the 6050 podcast or something? He really is the goat though I knew he messed with stocks but damn
110 2018-11-12 23:13:37 Looks good, just a couple issues:

1. I agree with most others in that 8 minutes is more appropriate for 3 stocks.
2. Not happy with stage selection. Neutral stages are the same as many other Smash games and all the new and interesting ones are e
not there or counterpicks.
111 2018-11-12 23:12:45 I track a bunch of useless metrics...but right now there are 42 $NDX stocks OverBought (StoRSI) to 3 oversold...and 11 - 1 same situation on $FFTY stocks...as in this turn down may have a long way to go.  May mean nothing...may be scary! $QQQ $SPY $IWM
112 2018-11-12 23:12:42 Isn’t it strange that when the US Stock Markets are doing so well, @realDonaldTrump says he has made it happen.

Now the Stocks are in free fall, he’s now blaming the Dems!

Doesn’t he know that HE is the one who is causing all the friction throughout the world?

#LoserPresident
113 2018-11-12 23:11:08 Yes, please! Affordable healthcare,education and a forensic audit of POTUS Trump's tax returns; plus, how would you legislate making all future candidates provide their tax returns, stocks or business interest whether newly acquired or long term ventures! TY..
114 2018-11-12 23:10:45 I am wondering with Trump and Fox that he has some investment for the Fox stocks.... that has been on his mind all day....
115 2018-11-12 23:10:25 Tune in 6-8pm ET on @BloombergTV for #DaybreakAsia  I’ll be bringing you the First Word news #markets #financialnews #tvnews #sydney #hongkong #newyork #stocks #brexit #opec
116 2018-11-12 23:08:52 Dear tech stocks: I can’t afford for you to keep slipping, clean up your act. Get with the program! Signed a very concerned individual.
117 2018-11-12 23:08:40 Everyone wants the higher returns from stocks without any volatility, but that's like asking for dessert without the calories.
118 2018-11-12 23:08:00 #Uranium stocks getting smashed all across the board. Remember to look at the big picture and be patient : it's never a get rich quick scheme.
119 2018-11-12 23:07:57 Not in mass shootings in schools and bars they are not sunshine.  Your talking about gang shootings etc etc.  Different stats, nice try though!  Once again rifles, versus semi-automatic and fully automatic win bump stocks that an 18 year old can buy? No reasons.  Just more babble
120 2018-11-12 23:07:20 The game being that slow is a non-factor imo. The idea behind it would be that with 3 stocks and a 6 minute timer, people are more likely to not close out stocks at the same rate, and will be more likely to try to camp out what's left on the smaller clock, as opposed to playing
121 2018-11-12 23:06:27 You should watch his video. His last point makes sense. If news outlets report BF5 being sexist or nazi loving or whatever, EA would lose much more money in stocks than the loss in preorders.
122 2018-11-12 23:06:17 #CampFire #WoosleyFire not caused by #ClimateChange. Drought. @Govjerrybrown #Democrats water policies, neglect. Overbuilding. #Firefighters are heroes. Watch $ALL $BRK.A $Y stocks.
123 2018-11-12 23:06:06 Only have 1 question #JIMCRAMER as follows...Do CEO"s keep their Overpayed Salaries when that Companies specific Stocks plummet???
124 2018-11-12 23:06:05 Berry, thanks for calling in we will have a tee shirt coming your way. Always keep 20% of your portfolio in foreign stocks but I will definitely recommend buying gold. Especially from the 3 a.m. gold coin infomercials. There is a reason only those people awake get access.
125 2018-11-12 23:05:42 I love it dickhead in chief!  Saw he blamed market drop on Dems. Friday it was oil&today it was tech stocks. Truthful news said it was the global economy slowing down. tRump spreads fear abt Muslim&MS13&putting military @ southern border all b4 midterms. Liar to the nth degree!
126 2018-11-12 23:05:19 When you are waiting for your stocks to vest
127 2018-11-12 23:03:38 @jimcramer  top 4 stocks to buy right now for a portfolio? Just looking for some good advice.

 Thank you Jim in advance
128 2018-11-12 23:03:26 It was a good day to buy some stocks if you had some extra cash laying around

130 2018-11-12 23:01:27 One has to ask why industrials are tanking while ISM is high and what happens to these stocks when ISM mean reverts.
131 2018-11-12 23:00:48 One thing crypto has taught me is to deal with losses a lot better. Stocks supposedly have been “horrible” of late, but this is NOTHING compared to  crypto.
132 2018-11-12 23:00:47 @AT09_Trader Hey bud I trade with Cobra DAS and they have a lot of stocks restricted for shorting  is Speed Trader better for locates ?  I emailed them 2x since I joined MIC and then haven’t responded to me at all
133 2018-11-12 23:00:32 U pathetic little TROLL! Stocks are responding to it the fact you're the worst leader this Country has ever seen! We see it! The World sees it! The only reason you're not behind bars is because u conspired with Putin to sell the Whitehouse in exchange for the Presidency! COWARD!
134 2018-11-12 22:59:40 IMO, stocks are crashing in response to trumps inadequate response to CA wildfires, troops doing nothing at the border, & horrible behavior in France. Not to mention batting his eyelashes & smiling like a bride at Putin. Not very good optics, anywhere.
135 2018-11-12 22:56:34 In a transitional period, am happy for them to pay British taxes on British fish landed in French ports. If they then want to pay tariffs whilst our fleet is reconstructed, that is negotiable, after all we have the same rights to Luxembourg fish stocks.
136 2018-11-12 22:56:17 Hate to break it to you, stocks have been dropping for months. But this was bound to happen sooner or later. The economy is cyclical. We have minor recessions every 7 or 8 years. Nothing new.
137 2018-11-12 22:54:31 Hey Matt! Long time listener, first time caller. Looking to re-invest some of the my suffering international stocks (tariffs amirite?) How do you feel about commodity stocks? Water primarily.
138 2018-11-12 22:53:09 $SPX -2%
$LITE -30% has orders cut,
$AAPL -5% the likely culprit,
so tech & growth stocks in retreat.
Oil up on Saudi prod cut talk,
but POTUS sends oil lower on tweet.
Auto tariff news sends mkt to lows.
Best: US$, REITs, Utes, Bonds
Worst: Tech, Nasdaq, Industrials
139 2018-11-12 22:53:04 Congrats sir .. your knowledge is wonderful..most thing we learn from where to sell the stocks .. we can buy any level but sell is most important.. i am follow u from two years .. i am living in saudi arabia .. oncs again congrats and best of luck also
140 2018-11-12 22:51:58 More f'idiocy and lies.
When the economy ramped up too quickly, the value of the dollar also increased. That SOUNDS like a good thing, but we got hit with the bill for that today. It made people less-motivated to buy stocks, as a direct. result.
141 2018-11-12 22:51:47 I don’t trust ETFs. Too much unexplained volatility relative to the underlying securities. Just look at what happened during the last #FlashCrash. Stick with mutual funds and individual stocks.
142 2018-11-12 22:50:25 Lol, your Supporters are gullible enough to believe this!!! 

If only they really know how stocks work!
143 2018-11-12 22:49:36 Remove debt,  invest in a sep IRA might work. Invest in Vanguard VTSAX and down the line pull the gains. Move to a city where public transportation can make a car not necessary.  Invest in dividend stocks and get to a point where you can live off the interest.
144 2018-11-12 22:49:29 Some stocks can resist that. #F1 has only got guaranteed revenue for 2 years so $FWONK cannot. Liberty has finally admitted that there's a perception of uncertainty which is what I have been saying for 2 years
145 2018-11-12 22:49:13 Actually, the market is lower over concern that high tech stocks have run their course, but that’s probably too complicated for you to understand
146 2018-11-12 22:48:40 I haven't seen any benefit. My son says his stocks are up (for now), my neighbor says his business profits are down 2 mths in row as his suppliers have increased prices due to tariffs. Family members still in coal mining are facing layoffs. No tears, they are manly men.
147 2018-11-12 22:47:55 but they must have uk stocks other wise they wouldn’t have a separate uk website? and the brush set is $149 and it’s £152 so even that is more expensive let alone the difference in dollars and pounds
148 2018-11-12 22:47:27 Stocks are down because of your trade Wars and policy uncertainties stop blaming the other party !! 
149 2018-11-12 22:47:23 I lost $10K if my retirement funds last month and my portfolio is only half stocks.  Alot of 401Ks are taking a beating as of late.
150 2018-11-12 22:47:11 You don’t buy stocks on guesses, like “I’m guessing they will turn it around”.  $GE.  You’ll get squashed. @CNBCFastMoney @grassosteve
151 2018-11-12 22:46:33 @tim_cook Stocks dropping - remember Western Auto, Montgomery Ward, Woolworth?  Nothing last for every Tim.  Make your money and retire - the country isn't going in the wrong direction APPLE IS.
152 2018-11-12 22:46:29 Wow. Stocks have really just been plummeting for the last 4 months
153 2018-11-12 22:46:26 Today I bought my first stocks, is this what it feels like to be an adult?
154 2018-11-12 22:46:21 @ByronBernstein hey reckful i was just wandering now that blizzard stocks are in the ground. Do you think it would be a good time to buy it? and then sell it when classic is about to come out and all of that?
155 2018-11-12 22:46:10 What have I said that would "punish" law-abiding gun owners bsides 0 bump stocks & MAYBE mag limits (tho you don't lose your gun, so that's not a 100% argument). Do you really see a tightened initial background check to ensure some1 who shouldn't get a gun doesn't as punishment?
156 2018-11-12 22:45:55 There you go blaming the Democrats again. Maybe stocks fell becuz of the way you used tax payer dollars to fly to Paris only to turn your back on honoring Americans who fought and lost their lives for this country

159 2018-11-12 22:44:10 Pres. Trump has said he will get back to negotiating table with China regarding tariffs, his job number are thru the roof... 

But the Dow plunged again today, over 600 pts, massive-sell off. 
Bellwether stocks, Apple down 5.04%; Amazon down 4.41%.
Google, Facebook. Netflix down.
160 2018-11-12 22:43:38 apple stocks rise by 20%.
161 2018-11-12 22:41:02 #NASDAQ out performance gone, back to parity with broader market, although some stocks like #AMZN still up almost 40% year to date.

Get out of the faang stocks asap. PSA to the retail investor, us small guys.
163 2018-11-12 22:40:01 Gonna be pushing for 7/8 minute timer in my local scene. Would much rather prefer it over 6 since we're running 3 stocks.
164 2018-11-12 22:39:38 @savestacks another example is Tilray I skipped it on purpose it was literally the only one I didnt buy and see what happened 300!! Im worried if “I” keep holding stocks will keep going down.
165 2018-11-12 22:38:54 Imho buying here is an absolute no brainer.  When money flows back in(it will soon) the best stocks will move first. DML is handcuffed until the financing closes anyways, so theres never been a better time to accumulate. #BackTheTruckUp
166 2018-11-12 22:38:49 The only thing effecting tech stocks today is Apple! F u trump!
167 2018-11-12 22:38:09 Beauty of this market is some tech names have nearly tanked 50% from peak. Forget whether or not a recession happens, some names are no braines of a buy. #stocks #investing #trading
168 2018-11-12 22:37:48 @savestacks I also bought Dollarama, Alimentation Couch Tard at their peeks. I look at stocks and see they do great. But when I buy and my eyeball watches them it just becomes a disaster

170 2018-11-12 22:36:40 @savestacks is buying stocks related to quantum physics because when I buy a stock and my eye ball watches it (just like quantum mechanics) the results change and become different. I looked at tweed aug 2015 skipped it. Bought it Jan 2018 and its been shit...
171 2018-11-12 22:35:37 I pulled 75% of my 401k out of stocks because I know the POTUS is a idiot and will destroy the economy. Now I'm the idiot because I should have pulled 100%. So should have Donald Trump's father.
172 2018-11-12 22:35:19 Stocks are dropping and I really want to sell. Scared I could get a better deal... A constant teeter totter!
173 2018-11-12 22:34:47 No. That is your awful economic policies like the the #TaxScam & you’re trade war with China. So you’re not only screwing the middle class but your rich friends too since 80% of stocks are owned by the top 10% of earners.
174 2018-11-12 22:34:00 At 1st my stocks were doing great. Lately, just about back to where I was.
175 2018-11-12 22:33:44 @Rampart1 fidelity only let's u put a $2 limit sell on stocks under a dollar otherwise I would lock all my shares to $100 lol
176 2018-11-12 22:30:53 So when the stocks are up and employment is way up it's because of Obama....  the next day the stocks fall, and economy takes a dip.. it's Trumps fault?? 
177 2018-11-12 22:30:47 @Barton_options stuck his neck out with some great stuff on seasonality being super negative for stocks, despite prevailing consensus
178 2018-11-12 22:29:09 Ahh ok, that's pretty smart. Then just leaving the other stocks blurred and the whole header sharp.
179 2018-11-12 22:28:57 That chart doesn’t include coal stocks.
180 2018-11-12 22:28:41 Market II: Breadth goes ice cold in U.S. #stocks, a negative sign after last week's rally signaled a potential bullish shift. On the #Nasdaq, losers smashed winners by a nearly 4-1 ratio. On #NYSE, it was less than 3 to 1. In a strong uptrend, the opposite should occur #trading
181 2018-11-12 22:28:30 We continue to expect stocks to rally into year-end, putting the S&P 500 in our year-end target range
of 2900–3000. @LPLResearch is dead wrong  Tony Dwyer too!
182 2018-11-12 22:28:11 I am Canadian. He bumped my stocks. Nothing really drastic as the whole world was recovering already, but it is there.
183 2018-11-12 22:27:28 The Dems not worshipping you doesn’t do much for stocks. If it does, then you could be blamed for things like that when obama was president
184 2018-11-12 22:26:32 @TheJuanWilliams impeach the president for what? The best economy in years?stocks going up as soon as he became president? Putting the embassy in Jerusalem?giving our military more money and more funds? Unemployment at a 17-year low? 
185 2018-11-12 22:26:26 “Stocks close sharply lower as Dow tumbles 600 points in wake of oil-market woes.”
186 2018-11-12 22:25:05 Trump termed the "prospect of presidential harassment," there is not much evidence the stock market will bat an eye if Democratic leaders in the House begin investigations into the Trump administration. Stocks rose before, during and after President Bill Clinton's impeachment.
187 2018-11-12 22:24:55 "And the meek shall inherit the earth" Matthew 5:5...

How, exactly, do Jesus' teachings endorse AR-15s and bump-stocks for civilians (PRIMARILY #Christians)?

#GunSenseNow
188 2018-11-12 22:24:44 Stocks have been volatile for months so this is not a Democrat problem. The Great Recession started when banks started collapsing in 2007 from deregulation which, if you are unaware, is before Obama took office. Major recessions can be traced to repub policy during repub control.

203 2018-11-12 22:16:30 Smash 4 matches can last about 3-4 mins with 2 stocks and not excessive camping.

205 2018-11-12 22:16:00 I know. I understand that 3 stocks will be tested due to popularity. But also vice versa I believe people are overestimating the speed of the pace before the game comes out. I really do think if it's not much faster than Smash 4 that people will get burned out farther in bracket.
206 2018-11-12 22:15:55 There is so much angst about the market drop. But why and from whom? It’s from momentum chasers caught in crowded trades. SP still up for the year.

209 2018-11-12 22:14:42 @realDonaldTrump  $5 trillion was wiped from stocks and bonds in October, the S&P 500 fell 7%, the Nasdaq sank 9%, and all gains for the Dow in 2018 were wiped out.  You spent plenty of time taking credit for the rise. Why aren't you talking about the markets now??
210 2018-11-12 22:14:21 right and if for some reason it was true sudden death as in both players had equal stocks and percent MAYBE I could rock with that. But no other game works like that. If I time you out and have a life lead I win. very simple.

240 2018-11-12 21:59:34 There are plenty of stocks that cost pennies. And the professor's link says that the boss "sold" the shares to the workers. So it was capitalism. And worker ownership of the Means of Production is fully compatible with capitalism.
241 2018-11-12 21:59:20 Dems tell the truth. Your the liar and stocks are reacting to your despicable performance and your total disrespect to our fallen this weekend. You are so so hated.

243 2018-11-12 21:57:19 No.
#Stocks were dragged down by the inevitable bursting of a bubble going same pattern housing bubble went - soaring prices while incomes near-flat and high percentage of incomes of current workers nil.

245 2018-11-12 21:55:36 No, it's the Tech Stocks sector. Until you align your thinking with reality, we're in trouble.
246 2018-11-12 21:55:33 Wall Street's major indexes declined overnight, with the S&P500 weighed down by tech & financial stocks as shares of Apple and Goldman Sachs came under pressure. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 65 points lower at 5,866.

248 2018-11-12 21:54:54 The US Dollar Is Extremely Strong Because Of Good Economic Policy.

250 2018-11-12 21:54:38 Stocks continue to tumble today. The 'Trump surge' has been all but eliminated and now the Obama gains are threatened.
Happens every time under Republicans. Both W and now Trump saw Clinton and Obama market gains diminished. 
Coincidence? Or perhaps just bad policy choices..

255 2018-11-12 21:51:32 Sort of like playing the lotto....it can build up to hundreds of millions, some win, and the rest lose. A friend was lamenting weeks ago that she's going to be homeless if stocks continue to fall. She must be frantic now.....sigh.
256 2018-11-12 21:51:12 $NKTR, $NRG, $CAG, $PRGO, and $FE were the top five stocks that closed higher today.

Saudi's are raising price per barrel to punish the West.Trump punishing 7 nations on Iranian oil to go into recession to buy US. We can't supply it
264 2018-11-12 21:47:27 That is on you & the other possible poor losers who are making a big deal about honest recounts of votes. Talk about whining! The stocks have been on roller coaster for months now! Quit blaming Dems &take some responsibility & show some compassion. Btw where is VA housing $$?
265 2018-11-12 21:46:40 Trumpism, more broadly this sweep today’s far right nationalism, is a global problem. You’re totally justified. Also we should all look into pooled investment in some sort of booze stocks. They may be the only companies to make it out alive.
266 2018-11-12 21:46:38 Finally I can start investing in buying and trading stocks. The dream can finally commence.

276 2018-11-12 21:43:03 The 69 new highs in the market today -- while the Dow blew up -- are some of your favorite dividend stocks:

1. Verizon
2. McDonald's
3. Hormel
4.Kohl's
5. Aetna
6. Procter & Gamble
7. Coca-Cola
8. Clorox
277 2018-11-12 21:42:23 8 minutes is a TOs nightmare. But with the speed of the game 8 minutes seems really long. Even for 3 stocks.
278 2018-11-12 21:42:19 $VRUS - Patience is key in OTC. I would rather find undervalued stocks and sit on them for months, than chase and end up making peanuts money. Accumulation is the name of the game here. We will get news and lots of it!

292 2018-11-12 21:38:04 @rachitpjain I have been following your tweets for a while. Recently watched your videos on YouTube. Explanation was simple and clear on how you analyse the stocks. Appreciate your time and effort!

298 2018-11-12 21:34:05 Today's Market = Monday Slump

Holiday trading left markets in a smooth downward trend today. Bigger daily swings seems to be the new normal, as a relatively boring news day paired a significant selloff in major tech stocks.

326 2018-11-12 21:23:32 Trump has done nothing. My stocks are better, but they have been increasing pretty steadily for several years now. As far as I can tell, the only thing he has done is NOT screwing that progress up. Adding $1,900,000,000,000 to the debt for the top 1% certainly didn't help.

Strong free cash flow to lower high debt levels. Expect share price to appreciate as debt lowers over time. Need to manage WarnerMedia well

363 2018-11-12 21:13:59 actually.....if Navarro prevails and Trump tariffs China 25% in Jan.....and happy Powell keeps motoring ahead with rate hikes......be the end of Trump market and easily  full recession in 2019 with stocks down 35% or more.....

368 2018-11-12 21:12:40 Agreed. But translate that to English. ETFs outperform by NOT BUYING OR SELLING THINGS. No customer accts, limited taxes, commissions. But what are they, then? They are nonredeemable substitutes derived from stocks and priced by arbitrage. Why would we stuff our mkt with these?
369 2018-11-12 21:11:57 tough to raise cash though when you've been using to buy all the dips over October and early November. None left unless stocks get sold now for lower prices than they were bought at in October ...

378 2018-11-12 21:08:54 Stocks are down 2%...
379 2018-11-12 21:08:51 WH statement #BreakingNews 

It’s raining. Stocks can’t perform in the rain. No contingency. No mitigation.
380 2018-11-12 21:08:50 @realDonaldTrump A radical collapse in stocks will engorge the DEMS, who plan it and execute it.  You should have looked into 1:02 cv 01242 GBL ED VA and 06 CIV 170 SD NY SAS, you could have learned how rigged the market is.  They own Judges.  They hire Serial Killers. USSA....
381 2018-11-12 21:08:31 Stocks down -600 points!!
382 2018-11-12 21:08:00 No; #stocks just can't sustainably keep soaring when the visible economy looks like one nil-wage workplace after another.
Who could buy stock in such an economy?  Certainly not those working in it.
383 2018-11-12 21:07:55 Estoy agotando stocks. Durísimo todo.
384 2018-11-12 21:07:35 Why would the uncovering of your shenanigans impact stocks? Get real. This is not what is going on.
385 2018-11-12 21:07:26 @ATMcharts ...now all they have to do is listen to the far far left socialists in the party and raise taxes=great for stocks
386 2018-11-12 21:07:18 World stocks ex Asia trounced: US -2.3%; Europe -1%. Fear permeated the US market as investors worried Tech stock trouble would migrate to the whole market.  Market now below bottom of my 2018 target-range of 2780. I believe will recover but volatility will continue to be severe.

388 2018-11-12 21:06:47 In smash 4 dont we play with generally more than enough time already? Timer set to 6 mins but 2 stocks usually only needs maybe 4 mins except for with certain characters/deliberately campy play-styles
389 2018-11-12 21:06:45 @realDonaldTrump Stop blaming Democrats for stocks you pig its your trade wars learn how to be a globalist your other pig friends have all the money in their pockets you give a huge tax cut you got the dog kicked out of you in mid terms and im happy
390 2018-11-12 21:06:44 Ummmmm.....no.
This is why:
"Stocks dropped in afternoon trading Monday, pulled down by a broad sell-off in tech companies & Saudi Arabia's planned cuts in oil production which revived concerns of a global slowdown."
If anything, the investigations by the Dems will make it go up!
391 2018-11-12 21:06:39 Help my parents with their retirement, go to my dream college, and invest a large amount of it into stocks.
392 2018-11-12 21:06:33 Their stocks are plunging as a consequence of this. Very convincing...
393 2018-11-12 21:05:47 Not very likely it will have an impact-like Congress banning gun stocks
394 2018-11-12 21:05:46 Had to laugh..... ABC posted on Facebook stocks are down  600.... Trump supporters are so ignorant they are blaming Dems that got elected...  They are not even in office yet  some pissed off trump supporters are losing instead of winning  Bunch of fools
395 2018-11-12 21:05:35 #handicapping #sportsbook
Some handicappers say you have to wager same amount on every game. Do you double down on 11 facing a 6 in Blackjack? The player's biggest advantage in wagering - sports, poker, stocks - is deciding when/how to bet; when odds favor you more, invest more!
396 2018-11-12 21:04:37 DOW closes down 600 points, on fears Tech sector has seen the highs.
Selling in all FANG stocks, lead by Apple, down almost 10 points.
397 2018-11-12 21:04:33 Hehehe. #btc & #stocks, one must be a trickster.
398 2018-11-12 21:04:17 I think the underlying issue dealing with the stock market’s decline is that the rise was artificial in the first place . The tax cuts that went mostly to the wealthy were used mostly to buy back stocks  by wealthy owners , CEO’s , & insiders . That maneuver has run its course .
399 2018-11-12 21:04:06 Most members of congress invest on wall st in AT&T stocks and att owns DTV now 2. Like I said nope no props to them at all
400 2018-11-12 21:04:00 ummmm you mean 5 to 6 stocks drove the markets up 50%. look I agree some things are WAY over valued but that does NOT mean most arent. machines and ETF's have distorted this market. lets not fight over this.
401 2018-11-12 21:03:53 Stocks taking another beating today. Thanks Trump!
402 2018-11-12 21:03:50 The only way to win is to plan and adapt to what the market is saying, strong USD means US economy is strongest. US companies and stocks is only game in town. Don’t guess and assume like a stock clown. Listen to the market like the big picture leader!
403 2018-11-12 21:03:36 Experts says it's tech stocks and pending recession.

I think I'll take their word over a magamaniac.
404 2018-11-12 21:03:32 @CLASH_Chia was right since brawl!!

But yeah fine. Now I wait for people to see 2 stocks has always been the truth.
405 2018-11-12 21:02:52 Such sad news today.   Stocks are down, Fires burned lots of buildings, You were in a wreck and Stan Lee died.  
406 2018-11-12 21:02:41 I have several question.

Why pick characters first ? Even when stage selection comes first ?
6 minutes is way to small for 3 stocks. We had 8 minutes/4 stocks and 8 minutes/2 Stock, Ultimate is only slighty faster and we add a stock, we should stay at 8 minutes, or at least 7
407 2018-11-12 21:02:31 NO...remember, when the GREAT news about the DEMS winning the house came down...the next day...stocks had a HUGE rise...this is because YOU keep calling fraud, which is a LIE, YOU act like a CHILD, YOU LIE, YOU EMBARASS the nation, YOU are NOT a leader...THAT IS THE ISSUE!
408 2018-11-12 21:01:46 Suggests UK stocks better value?

412 2018-11-12 21:00:38 What Trump termed the "prospect of presidential harassment," there is   no evidence the stock market will bat an eye if Democratic leaders in  the House begin investigations into the Trump administration.
Stocks  rose before, during & after President Bill  Clinton's impeachment.
413 2018-11-12 21:00:13 I've seen it at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, other places. Its an issue of what the store stocks and also where you are, as its made in California.
414 2018-11-12 21:00:11 My stocks feel better at this news. GRIFTER n THIEF needs oversight.
415 2018-11-12 21:00:11 That’s a point I just made to my colleagues. Midstream constraints and still-to-come regulation, yes. Oil prices lower, yes. But didn’t expect CO stocks to be lower a week after the NO victory than they were the day before an expected close vote. Why?

420 2018-11-12 20:58:55 This will shoot up.  I hope hope he doesn't increase outstanding shares or authorized.  Let it run and grow.
421 2018-11-12 20:58:54 No, friends, the fact that a Democratic House may be pursuing investigations of the Trump administration is not the reason the #stockmarket is down today. And when the market goes up, beware of you-know-who taking credit for it. #stocks #investing #money
422 2018-11-12 20:58:41 Actually, it is the prospect of higher interest rates that is driving stocks down. Which in turn is caused by fears of inflation. Which in turn is caused by the fact that the producer price index (PPI) is going up up up. Which in trun is caused by YOUR TRADE WAR, Donald.
423 2018-11-12 20:58:29 Quit spending, start investing... No not in stocks.
424 2018-11-12 20:58:19 I installed Robinhood so I can try this buying/selling stocks thing and my very first stock purchase was in a cannabis company.

Why do we need 3 stocks? I'm not convinced Ult is faster than Smash 4.

Even if it is, is it fast enough for 3 stocks all of a sudden?
441 2018-11-12 20:54:45 Wait till panic selling kicks in, u will witness all indices plunging....many etfs own same stocks...bottle necking should occur that can cause prices to really plummet....

449 2018-11-12 20:52:22 RM news will trump chart. RSI is a good indicator, but can't get tunneled vision and rely on a single indicator. Many stocks have ran for days/weeks with a 80+ RSI. GLTU.
450 2018-11-12 20:52:21 I honestly would prefer 2 stocks 6 minutes.

I'm not convinced the game is faster than Smash 4 yet. At least not fast enough for 3 stocks.

474 2018-11-12 20:43:46 Why 3 stocks 6 mins? We've gotten timeouts in Smash 4 with 2 stocks and Ultimate's pace isn't much faster. 7 or 8 mins pls!

Also DSR should not be used nowadays. Only works for Melee because they don't have stages or bans.

We got tons more stages now & can go with 2 stage bans.
475 2018-11-12 20:43:37 Interest rate rise plus coming Trump trade war with China is causing major RISK OFF sentiment.  January Trump ups level of tariffs with China.  With a strong dollar why stay in stocks? Everyone is running to safety, US, JPY, and Swiss bonds. Until this blows over.
476 2018-11-12 20:43:29 IMO it should be 3 minutes per stock(2 stocks 6 minutes) so ideally for me it should be 3 stock 9 minutes but I'm willing to compromise and be 3 stocks 8 minutes
477 2018-11-12 20:43:14 Pullbacks and consolidation are all part of long term healthy moves, as you know I'm sure. Everyone wants their stocks to go straight up and never look back but that's not how it works. $TREP looks a lot healthier and sustainable now that it's reset a great deal.
478 2018-11-12 20:42:43 Why wouldn't they. Isn't it part of your deal, when they buy all those weapons from you? Not to mention that is it US refineries that are the real cause of oil prices skyrocketing, and influencing stocks.

486 2018-11-12 20:40:17 The company that manufactures a lot of condoms is one of the stocks up today. Hmmm must be a case about abortion getting close to being considered by the Supreme Court.
487 2018-11-12 20:39:50 WHY did financial stocks blow up today-I can tell u I predicted this disruption confidently waaay back because of the large astrological pattern.

492 2018-11-12 20:38:02 @boringisgood Ramp has never lost money in stocks that went up after he bought them.
493 2018-11-12 20:37:25 This ruleset is fucking BAD. 3 stocks 7 minutes is definitely what we should be doing. WHY IS LYLAT A STARTER? Dude wtf.
494 2018-11-12 20:37:21 I've always wanted to get into stocks.. I've done simulations and what not with them and it's fun when you're making bank
495 2018-11-12 20:37:11 As an economist you are a f-cking idiot, hopefully this isn’t your primary job!   First the Chinese have had extreme tariffs on our goods for decades yielding 800 billion in trade deficits.  Hence China became a supplier not a trade partner.  Increased interest = Lower Stocks
496 2018-11-12 20:37:07 Then the Fed should stop propping stocks

500 2018-11-12 20:36:26 seriously, stocks have been taking a hit since september, because of your stupid trade war and fed's rising interests.
501 2018-11-12 20:36:13 I get concerned about what you tell your friends before you say this stuff so they will know which stocks to short and which to buy beforehand

504 2018-11-12 20:35:30 Personally I’m down for test some obscure stages in the beginning to what sticks but we should probably start with 3 stocks 8 mins instead of 6 mins.

508 2018-11-12 20:34:18 The market is a show of Trump’s Criminal Corruption coming our way in the new year. Finally Honest Investigations & accountabilities for Trump & the Republicans who refused to even investigate themselves. The market is actually reacting to overpriced Tech Stocks like Apple.
509 2018-11-12 20:33:54 Always watch Buffet aka Midas.
If he's selling off stocks you have to wonder why.
He's selling off stocks.
510 2018-11-12 20:33:21 My homie gets prison calls everyday.

Since I’ve put him on to Financial Literacy and Wealth Building, he STRESSES to them about it.

“Fuck sports and ALL other shit, bro. Just workout and learn about INVESTING.”

We got inmates buying Stocks & Crypto, b. 

This is MAJOR to me.
511 2018-11-12 20:32:43 Not as a starter. It doesn't promote planking, has a unique shape that can change matchups, has a unique platform setup, and without tilting the biggest issue is gone.

At least imo. It's not my favorite stage, but it can help and hurt and it won't randomly take stocks. Good cp.

513 2018-11-12 20:32:14 Tech stocks are falling ...  Apple leads the way down . Do you know anything about anything? 
514 2018-11-12 20:31:13 What % of people actually use fiat currency as a long term SoV?

My sense is that people don't care about the "omg the dollar is inflating at 2% per year. In 100 years our fortunes will be wiped out" argument because they mostly store wealth in stocks/bonds/real estate.
515 2018-11-12 20:30:47 I hope he was better at military tactics, it will take 30 to 50 years to build the infrastructure and the plant. by the time we build it the stocks of uranium will be nearly gone, the cost of the power prohibitive. How many plants does Jim plan to build?

517 2018-11-12 20:29:52 same could be said for Melee but it discourages timeouts if it was 4 stocks and 6 minutes
518 2018-11-12 20:29:16 Not a hater of bleeding crypto but BC's gap theory is to be known 25+ years ago as windows.
The theory of windows in stocks used to be a thing in the 80's but are simply just low liquidity mixed with book volume

In other words,
Gaps have no relevance

522 2018-11-12 20:27:42 the Vegas Smash Ultimate TOs & I are still in discussion for what we'll use in our locals here but one thing we are mostly agreed on is 3 stocks & 8 minutes to avoid timeouts.

526 2018-11-12 20:25:41 Anecdotal... chip stocks may be down BUT ... I made a visit to a large store / Micro Center to buy a couple of small parts for my PC this weekend. Parking lot was full / spilling over ... store was jammed. The PC is far from dead.
527 2018-11-12 20:25:00 How will extreme Brexiteers benefit in a post Brexit, deregulated, low tax nation? They want to crash the economy so that they can deploy their capital that is waiting on the sidelines to buy up everything cheap. Stocks, infrastructure, property and of course the pound.

532 2018-11-12 20:23:09 These Wall St pumpers never stop! Trying to keep getting retail investors to buy such grossly overvalued & slowing momentum stocks like $NFLX, so smart money can unload.
533 2018-11-12 20:22:20 Fundamental research doesnt matter when stocks like $ROKU $BZUN fall 50%  in few wks. $TTD next

Prioritize price research. Prioritize your brokerage account growth metrics over company growth metrics

Companys can grow 1000% as long as stock/your acc value go down its irrelevant
534 2018-11-12 20:22:08 I did buy some $BLCM today (trades to be reported next) but I probably wouldn't bet the farm on it. Stocks that decline "irrationally" to this degree often end up having their pipelines blow up "unexpectedly".
535 2018-11-12 20:21:30 Seems U stocks in general are 1 step forward and 1 step backwards these days. Extremely volatile with big fluctuations. 8% up one day, 9% down the next. Meanwhile the U spot price is very stable and steadily increasing towards 30USD.

546 2018-11-12 20:18:26 @jimcramer At the start the 2000-2002 bear market, utilities/staples and other #SafeMoney stocks powered higher even as overvalued, overowned #tech tanked. In 2000: $XLU +22.1%, $XLP +25.3%, $XLK -41.9%. Maybe history is "rhyming" b/c a new bear is starting?

611 2018-11-12 19:45:40 I would run from anything position CNBC is promoting.  Having said that, sometimes that can have a positive impact or stocks just don’t care. I bought FSLR when it was removed from the nasdaq 1.5 years ago.  Tripled my money. Replace by AMD which sank.
612 2018-11-12 19:45:21 I dig the polished bits on the glock. I've never been much of an AR kind of guy, but I can see it being a fun plinker. I'm a real big fan of magpul stuff, so I tend to put their stocks on a lot of my guns.

616 2018-11-12 19:44:03 how Trump brings down stocks with a tweet, and nobody seems to think there's anything wrong with that....
617 2018-11-12 19:43:43 Let's see:
1. Trump announces tariffs for goods.
2. Manufacturers reduce orders as the cost of goods just increased.
3. Companies begin to slow hiring.
4. Stocks more volatile.
5. Dow is essentially the same now as it was in Jan 2018 (no gain and more days less than 26,000).
618 2018-11-12 19:43:08 Trump is obsessed with imposing tariffs on foreign cars, including Europe.
Stocks have moved up too much.
They haven’t priced in tariffs on all foreign cars.

622 2018-11-12 19:40:50 This is great information presented in a great way.
If I may, it is accurate to say.
When stocks fell 10%:
The overall correction magnitude was greater than 10% 100% of the time.
42.7% of the time the overall correction magnitude was between 20 - 50%

628 2018-11-12 19:38:01 Thanks for posting this Dave. 
I used to run a similar study every so often, though I used a running average of the daily national average cash price. 
Now comes the question:
1) Is the ending stocks-to-use GUESS to low?
or
2) Is average cash price too high?
629 2018-11-12 19:37:52 My stocks took a big hit today on mostly my smaller penny stocks. It has been pretty hard for me lately to judge the market's patterns.

660 2018-11-12 19:19:09 How come you didn't notice the drop in the markets when Trump started the trade war? Notice the bump in the markets when the corporations were buying back stocks after their tax gift? Oversight is essential, and awareness of the POTUS self interest comes from studying his actions
661 2018-11-12 19:18:30 stocks down is bad for crypto
662 2018-11-12 19:17:30 I think you know this, but one is a stock the other is a currency, buying stocks can be an investment, buying bitcoin is purely speculation, not saying it's a bad idea but the "The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name."

664 2018-11-12 19:16:18 Liar—it's not about the investigations in your future, it's related to the tech sector's performance.

672 2018-11-12 19:12:43 This also skews budget and economic analysis of government procurement abroad. Here, in France, buying drugs made in China has undeniably allowed some public budget savings, but on the other side of stocks of drugs much higher, and increasing amounts.

729 2018-11-12 18:47:20 A money correspondent from Wall St just said the reason for the big drop is the drop in Apple stocks- they are down 5%, which is affecting the market in a very negative way.

736 2018-11-12 18:44:46 The stock market only went up and stayed up for so long because the companies you gave tax cuts to went and bought their own stocks and propped up the prices instead of investing in new equipment or higher wages.

737 2018-11-12 18:43:50 @realDonaldTrump bro what’s happening to my stocks man. That was basically all I trusted you with.
738 2018-11-12 18:43:04 Stock market doesn't give a RAT'S ASS about whether you get investigated. Stock market reacts to economy and where they think it's headed. The stocks collapsed several times before election. You know this. It's just another excuse you made up to blame dems.
739 2018-11-12 18:42:31 Doesn’t Mr. Munger say no to buying automotive stocks?
740 2018-11-12 18:42:28 I miss trading stocks
741 2018-11-12 18:42:05 What Trump termed the "prospect of presidential harassment,"  there is  no evidence the stock market will bat an eye if Democratic leaders in  the House begin investigations into the Trump administration. Stocks  rose before, during & after President Bill  Clinton's impeachment.
742 2018-11-12 18:42:03 Oh yeah the stocks are really in tune with your emotional needs. Because everything apparently revolves around how Trump feels, lol.
743 2018-11-12 18:41:59 Haha yeah right. Your a terrible president, that is why stocks are so volatile.
744 2018-11-12 18:41:59 Smart investors will be buying blue chip stocks at bargain low prices. So many value shares around right now.
745 2018-11-12 18:40:55 Oh i know.... because you lost your investment in stocks just now right?

750 2018-11-12 18:39:44 “But muh 401k gains!” is the only reason any non-klan member still supports Trump. If stocks finish the year at 0%, he’ll have nothing going for him anywhere.

756 2018-11-12 18:37:48 Facebook was down for about 20 minutes. Did everyone survive without their steady supply of dopamine? 

By day's end stocks will be up 10,000% because that was the most productive 20 minutes anyone remembers prior to 2004.
757 2018-11-12 18:37:37 Yes. W/O stripping citizens the right to own guns, critique the laws according to who’s buying which guns. Besides law enforcement/military personnel no sale of AR-15s or bump stocks. For ammunition, monitor the sale & usage per person as is done with pseudoephedrine products.

785 2018-11-12 18:32:45 Stocks.  Personally I think it's wrong for financial advisors to push  you to hold stocks in your 401k & IRA when there are signs of an  upcoming crash.  If you know pros and cons  you can decide.
786 2018-11-12 18:32:11 First priority is to get yourself over to @Sark_Island & visit @caraghchocs @SarkHotel for a few days & enjoy the homebrew at Stocks!

($10 they say they don’t need us as much cause look how much inventory they now have!). It’s the what don’t I see that matter
793 2018-11-12 18:30:43 Stocks will be down over 1,000 tomorrow. Haha. I'm told gold will drop to $1,190 so what will I be doing? No guesses needed.

796 2018-11-12 18:29:28 I don’t believe a recession is in the cards but this is certainly a painful correction especially on growth stocks which previously were the top performers. If you think this can get a lot worse then one massive short has to be $TSLA.
797 2018-11-12 18:29:21 Watching Stocks the last month has hurt. A lot. 
798 2018-11-12 18:29:18 Thanks @realDonaldTrump ! If youre claiming credit for stocks on its way up, you will also share in blame when theyre down.
799 2018-11-12 18:29:08 Look for gaps on the downside.  I'm seeing stocks fill gaps that I didn't think would fill.  $AMZN closed gap OCT 30. Possible retest.  $AAPL 190-193.  $BHC...scan, screen, and short.  LOTS MORE
800 2018-11-12 18:28:59 Here it comes... blaming someone else for his failures.  This from same guy who lost money in the money making CASINO BUSINESS.  Trump had one year of stocks rising and 1 year of dismal earnings.  Not the Dems fault.

802 2018-11-12 18:27:49 The highest loss comes from stocks which have grown faster than the company.
803 2018-11-12 18:26:33 I said this before and I'm going to say this again.  The pot stocks are going to drop by a LOT from right here.   You can pick the symbols, they are going to be liquidated.
804 2018-11-12 18:26:25 Something tells me his stocks aren't performing.

869 2018-11-12 18:08:13 Yea but my stocks struggling lol
870 2018-11-12 18:07:59 Obama did everything he could to choke off the private sector. The market rose because the Federal Reserve annihilated seniors/ savers by lowering interest rates to 0%, and increasing their balance sheet to 4.5 trillion dollars. In essence forcing investors to  buy stocks
871 2018-11-12 18:07:43 How about it been over inflated, because of the 1 % bought back company stocks.
872 2018-11-12 18:06:41 Can I buy stocks?
873 2018-11-12 18:06:26 Maybe, I think that stocks are just running low to be honest.

875 2018-11-12 18:05:57 .@realDonaldTrump Lying conman! The stocks are lower because tech stocks are having a bad time. It has NOTHING to do with the Democrats. Stop lying every time you tweet. Hate is not something we need more of in the United States. U have become the great divider, not good.

881 2018-11-12 18:02:43 .@realDonaldTrump Base, the stocks are going down because of tech stocks. It has nothing to do with democrats. drumpf is wanting you to hate more than you have been. He wants to split the United States. Please realize what he is trying to do. Did you hate this much before him?
882 2018-11-12 18:02:41 I was first bio fund manager of Korea. I started to buy US bio stocks cause they were relatively undervalued.  However their volatility is outrageous.  My strategy is start to add one with greater than 80% losses.

885 2018-11-12 18:02:10 How does the President spend Veterans Day?  Is it spent honoring Veterans, or is it spent on Twitter, tweeting? Of course, the latter. Do our military care about the stocks? NO!They care about spending time with their families. You have them on the border, for a fake invasion!

898 2018-11-12 17:57:51 Problem is high promoter shareholdings in most companies but rbi mandates lower shareholding in financials .. .. as an investor would you like 40% in one sector ? That may well happen in few years in nifty... top 10 stocks are 56% of index.. i dont know a solution !Only questions
899 2018-11-12 17:57:28 I will not vote for Rahul Gandhi and Congress even then becoz UPA oversaw the siphoning of $500b to tax havens and laundered via benami PN. This set back  India for decades.

904 2018-11-12 17:56:46 I read something a while back that fast food stocks and other "comfort" stocks perform well in poor markets. As stocks go down and the economy suffers generally people have less money to spend and these stocks do well because people eat more fast food during stressful times.
905 2018-11-12 17:55:43 $CRQE this is why it’s hard to quit on OTC stocks. Was down on this for a while thru fake twitter accounts and flirting with no-bids.... sold for a gain today.
906 2018-11-12 17:55:06 With how the stock market is hammering tech stocks today, it's a REALLY bad day for a publicly traded social network to crash
907 2018-11-12 17:54:50 Big old head of DJT’s covering that large brain is smarting. Insulting Macron didn’t give him enough Putin time alone in City of Bro’mance (not that there’s anything wrong with that) Mel’s Contract says it’s fine if DJT still dates.

911 2018-11-12 17:52:49 I call my reps often to ask that they support the gun safety legislation that polls show the majority of Americans support, like universal background checks and bans on bump stocks and assault rifles. I also donate to @Everytown and this year I'll be adding @AMarch4OurLives.
912 2018-11-12 17:52:49 This is a BIG lie. It's tech stocks doing it today.  Your indictments are coming.

914 2018-11-12 17:51:55 Curious as to why Kalos (bigger PS2) is legal, but not YI:B (bigger SV).  A bit worried about only 6 minutes for 3 stocks, but we'll see.
915 2018-11-12 17:51:39 Pikachu should be voiced by a kid or something that nigga sounds like he’s 40 and trades stocks for a living
916 2018-11-12 17:51:24 I hope people understand that XRP is the blockchain for the established finance system. They can keep doing what they do by employing DLT. Investing in XRP while hodling BTC, is like investing in Shell while hodling Tesla stocks.
917 2018-11-12 17:51:18 Sugar stocks are too volatile right now to invest
918 2018-11-12 17:50:20 The market has to prove that it can hold in and build a base at higher levels, not seeing that yet.

Interesting to see precious metals down, yen flat, and bonds up only a bit with stocks down this much.

923 2018-11-12 17:48:23 Hi - they are indicators of bear markets - two of them indicate recession. Here are the 8:
HY spreads >125 bps, stocks/bonds correl. flips, cyclical EPS less than defensive, margin forecasts peak, sentiment at extreme, breadth deteriorates, YC inverts, UR rises
924 2018-11-12 17:47:45 Currently the mkt can't change the outstanding stock of fixed-price instruments ("cash," checking/MM deposit balances) as it can w/ stocks & bonds, bidding prices up and down. (Or: can only v slowly via comm bank net lending/borrowing.)

With your proposal, it could!
925 2018-11-12 17:47:36 @andy64 It takes a while but you'll learn - never believe in your stocks only your stops.
926 2018-11-12 17:46:27 Stocks  down in .07’s now cheers!
927 2018-11-12 17:46:08 sigh.... of course this country couldn’t care less if the theatre and film industries here no longer have regular access to incandescent bulbs. I understand that it is impractical for everyday use but withholding all stocks of it from the people who actually need them 
928 2018-11-12 17:45:55 Put it to ya this way: If the #Redskins were currently trading on Wall Street, I wouldn’t sell any stocks, but don’t think I’d buy any either. #HTTR

933 2018-11-12 17:44:33 The system of Checks and Balances is not a tool to harass you.  Yet, you lie once again.  The Stock Market is/alway volatile and corporations have borrowed too much money to buy back their stocks after the tax scam bill.
934 2018-11-12 17:44:28 Housing bubble only in CA currently. Not like 2007-2008, which happened everywhere

Credit bubble is under control, and the Banking is relatively healthy.

No imminent crises on the horizon.

Another NDX 5-10% correction & valuation reset for high P/E stocks, we'll be fine. IMHO

936 2018-11-12 17:43:42 There you go. Pass the blame whenever convenient. Stocks up? All about you. Stocks down? It’s the Democrats fault. You are a joke.
937 2018-11-12 17:43:34 Surveillance is a joke for Sebi 1st thing how can you allow stocks like Infibeam to trade in F&O have you ever heard anyone buying anything from Infibeam Sebi has let many low volume stocks to trade in F&O to manipulate and make big easy money
938 2018-11-12 17:43:13 Yes...when everyone "knows" there is a FTD, and everyone "knows" it is the seasonally most favorable time for stocks...it's usually a good time to take the other side of the trade. My #1 trading rule is to never buy anything when its price is below a declining 50 day MA...period.
939 2018-11-12 17:42:10 Ayboo ngempela... When the stocks were below 50%, what did we do? This newly found supplier, where was he when we were at 45% stock level?
These are people's lives that we are talking about 
940 2018-11-12 17:40:41 Crypto is too slow and the big ones are way too expensive. I might get some stocks to keep long term, like marijuana ones.

945 2018-11-12 17:38:50 I’ve just mostly been doing short term penny stocks bc they’re volatile but are more profitable if they go up and less damaging if they go down. I just started trading options as well.

966 2018-11-12 17:32:11 Those stocks trade completely different. Both have your good side, but there's no similarity.
967 2018-11-12 17:32:02 No such thing trump.  It's more like trumps Nationalist party won't help the world economy let alone expect increase in stocks.
968 2018-11-12 17:31:49 Yes. It doesn't matter if it's 1%, 1.1% or 0.9%. If you limit it in that range it will be ok. I would consider limiting the position size, too. If you risk 1% and have a 35% position, it will be too large. Especially if you are trading volatile stocks.
969 2018-11-12 17:31:37 If you see the massive selling off the stocks you know immediately that the big holders are playing games the Americans must quickly buy it so the riches can't buy backs in the lowest prices, if they are buying back the prices will be higher so they loosing

978 2018-11-12 17:29:52 $AAPL - I was thinking about Buy the Dip.. but - on Daily it look like H&S pattern (one shoulder not clean) -- if that's the case -- 197 is the neck line and around 170 is the target, i.e. for now- I will stay away from AAPL for "buy the dip".. #aapl #spx #trading #stocks #market
979 2018-11-12 17:29:48 He thinks stocks are the majority of the population’s concern. The majority have no stock because they are teetering on poverty. When it’s doing good it’s him,doing bad it’s democrats. Trump is a liar .

989 2018-11-12 17:26:19 Yes you are correct, the difference between our two points is that I see games in a set as something that should be valued why you do not, and that's a fair disagreement.

996 2018-11-12 17:23:06 The rules @skisonic and I were using for "All-Brawl" back in the day were.

1st stage is random, selected before character selection.
Loser can counterpick stage or character, never both.
2 stocks, 3 minutes, 3 out of 5.

Played fast and fun!
997 2018-11-12 17:22:49 For those working in bigger corporations, have you taken advantage of your company’s stocks and shares scheme yet?

999 2018-11-12 17:22:11 Yes, and peninsular denuclearization implies that the ROK would be subject to the same inspections regime (in particular, inspections and international control of fissile material stocks) as would the DPRK.  None of the parties is yet talking about these conditions.

1011 2018-11-12 17:17:04 Investigation of your extramarital affairs is affecting the stocks market?  I doubt it.  Deficit spending and tariffs are much more likely the cause.
1012 2018-11-12 17:16:54 Obviously the stocks you own aren’t in Twitter! Because you created your Twitter account about 5-minutes ago Comrade, lol.
1013 2018-11-12 17:16:30 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your carpal tunnel syndrome
1014 2018-11-12 17:16:26 YES! I'm constantly saying to people who ask me about stocks that (based on the factors you listed) "the right answer for one investor is very often the wrong answer for another investor" ... but it rarely seems to get through.

1019 2018-11-12 17:15:41 Trump's a con man. He's not winning. He's never been winning. He propagandizes winning, using a base of thoughtless people who simply trust him. Meanwhile, he's ripping the country to shreds. A drop in oil prices is dragging stocks. Trump knows that. He's not that stupid
1020 2018-11-12 17:14:50 Stocks, especially tech stocks are in a freefall, but the dollar is gaining after trade war with China escalates? Hmmm...
1021 2018-11-12 17:14:17 CNBC TV traders WERE ALL RECOMMENDING oil stocks in the face of @realDonaldTrump & @TeamTrump talk of energy independence, net exporter & Saudi assistance. THAT WAS A BAD trade. Fed will NOT overhike.  Continue to avoid overpriced high-flyers. BUY/ADD DEEP-VALUE BARGAINS.

1037 2018-11-12 17:10:40 Sorry people, Trump is absolutely right. The way he campaigned and the absence of ridiculous "blue wave" didn't allow anything to be "baked in". This election was a toss up. Oil stocks were a factor. We are hitting economy numbers out of the park.

1040 2018-11-12 17:08:58 Frankly, Trump would blame the Democrats for the stock market falling even if they weren't in power. And I'll bet he'll take credit for stocks rising even if they crash.
1041 2018-11-12 17:08:29 Great blog post as always! Just wanted to let you know that there is a typo  "invest in US stocks, covering the period 2981-2015. The study" or the researchers have time traveled!
1042 2018-11-12 17:08:22 im shutdown the CNBC fastmoney show now, why?

1045 2018-11-12 17:06:47 Check out CA utility stocks. They are crashing. CA has a lot bigger problems to deal with then EV subsidies. These fires are a disaster
1046 2018-11-12 17:06:42 Oh, people still trade stocks. I'm not completely sure they still trade MLPs though 
1047 2018-11-12 17:06:10 That's the stupidest assertion ever (although it's hard to choose from among tRump's idiotic statements). Is this the logic: Oh, no, someone is about to insult DJT; I'd better sell my stocks ??
1048 2018-11-12 17:06:05 Also, a note on the "analysis on other stocks:" The deep level of analysis I do on TSLA is unusual; it's a one-off. The Portfolio tier will be more along the lines of "a mile wide and an inch deep," but I will carefully design that inch. It will be an entirely different approach.

1053 2018-11-12 17:05:08 We’ve had a long bull market. Long-term interests are starting to rise, but I don’t know that they are to the point that people will start moving money from stocks to bonds.
1054 2018-11-12 17:04:58 The 'Permanent Portfolio' suggests allocating 25% each to the following asset classes: stocks $spy, long-term debt $tlt, physical gold, and cash $usd.

1059 2018-11-12 17:04:04 Another rough day for stocks. I think my biggest take from the past two months is how surprisingly low volatility was for such a long run.

I think I’ll have $1000 to invest on Friday.
1063 2018-11-12 17:02:19 No it’s your inadequate understanding of how anything works, your tariffs. The stocks FELL before the midterms. Any gain was wiped out.
1064 2018-11-12 17:01:59 The stock market was already declining, the buy back stocks the rich bought thanks to his tax breaks are done with. They’ve been decking for at least 3 straight weeks. But ya gotta blame somebody, right? Fuck capitalism, let the market die.
1065 2018-11-12 17:01:51 54% of all Americans have stocks of some kind, 32% of those are 401K's so technically yes, most Americans have money in the stock market, whether they realize it or not.
1066 2018-11-12 17:01:43 Stocks fall 1.4% because $AAPL might sell less iPhones, Goldman is caught up in a 1MDB mess, and $GE is still falling apart.  Thanks for playing

1076 2018-11-12 17:00:07 It's also a drag on the economy. You give more money to low-paid workers, they spend it, which stimulates the economy. Give it to multi-millionaire CEOs, they're just going to buy existing stocks, which does not.

1080 2018-11-12 16:59:08 US stocks traded sharply lower on Monday, with the Dow slumping over 450 points, or more than 1.7 percent.
1081 2018-11-12 16:58:51 Can you try it in a few more stocks.
1082 2018-11-12 16:57:16 maybe. but GFC, PIIGS, Taper aftermath, Fragile 5 all saw USTs bid. likely that USTs get bid again bc liquidity premium and the ability to rally (will be no prohib hedging costs either)

for retail (not an institution), gold and gold stocks should explode as real yields collapse!

1087 2018-11-12 16:55:38 @royalwinsmid how are the stocks looking today
1088 2018-11-12 16:55:33 So how is the game and are there any mtx's in there because if so things don't look good for dice and EA considering EA's stocks dropped by more than 40 percent.

1093 2018-11-12 16:54:11 And it wasn’t in bear market territory when it closed at 1507 two weeks ago?  Headline should be RE-enters or better yet, skip it altogether and just realize stocks are normally volatile and can go up as well as down.

1097 2018-11-12 16:53:18 More BS! YOU ARE the cause of a major portion of stock market volatility: stock buy backs, disguised as YOUR fake tax cut have gone away, margin buying of stocks is at levels near 2007, so more sell offs are ahead,AND,your FAKE trade negotiations with China (tariffs) hurt growth

1099 2018-11-12 16:52:36 Stocks suck worse and a lot of long term stock market guys are coming over to crypto. All the big companies, banks, etc are all trying to use the tech. Sounds just like the internet mid 90’s good luck with the boring breaking down cycle you are in.
1100 2018-11-12 16:52:24 The media is causing the damage to the stock market. They are destroying you today. So everybody in the country should see MSNBC CNN and New York Times Washington Post is why their stocks are losing money today Terian It is the media licking their chops!

1106 2018-11-12 16:51:19 The reason I agree with Dave's take on single stocks is because these are always very volatile. Many people who buy single stocks do so in day-trading fashion, and short-term investments do not work as a permanent investment strategy.

1112 2018-11-12 16:49:45 It's far from good but up until now they've not given a f*ck and when they finally do, their stocks drops, essentially telling them that this wasnt' a good move. Just hoping they will keep at it and improve :).
1113 2018-11-12 16:49:22 NEW YORK ( 11-12-2008) -- Stocks fell Wednesday for the third session in a row, with the Dow tumbling over 400 points, as investors bet that a long and deep recession is on the horizon.The Dow Jones industrial average (INDU) lost 411 points, or about 4.7%, to 8,282.66

1117 2018-11-12 16:46:43 big headaches for the investor class (and I am guessing they understand that the stock market rises and falls all the time). about half of the US population don't own stocks. maybe you should focus on them.

1140 2018-11-12 16:41:32 Michael, any way to compare this action to 2000?  This seems like a replay in terms of the Utilities, Staples, REITS, etc. sold off prior to the Tech crash and once the Tech crash started, these stocks really held up. Not calling a tech crash, but it seems the action is similar.

1143 2018-11-12 16:39:27 Today the stocks markets are big selling off by the rich people to embarrassing the President Trump and is a good time for the Americans to buy it, because the oil is low and President is cutting taxes the people will have more money to spend.

1152 2018-11-12 16:35:59 the patent on the 'active' ingredient in both just ran out making them free market... so ya the stocks really are 'going down' *wink* XD
1153 2018-11-12 16:35:15 Really it's because of the false value surge stocks experienced after record buybacks. This is just mms pulling the rug out.
1154 2018-11-12 16:34:33 Stocks are tanking.
1155 2018-11-12 16:34:30 Good. Hope your stocks tank.

1176 2018-11-12 16:28:53 @Roadwait threw in bunch of words that are disjointed. Stocks went up substantially due to trump’s policies. it is in stalemate due to threats by federal reserve to raise interest rates & uncertainty from election. Rates are up because of strong economy. No significant inflation.

Nice reminder.
1202 2018-11-12 16:22:13 Definitely something with these Reverse split stocks and Naked Shorts, I've seen quite a few that spike usually just shy of a year from the Reverse date.  Like that's as long as the clearing firms can hold off on delivery.

1212 2018-11-12 16:19:55 That's funny because as soon as the Dems took back the house, market confidence have improved, thus showing improvement in stocks. You must really hate facts.

Insofar as the growth slope reflects incr population (~2%), efficiencies ( ~2%), and inflation (~2%), anything above the sum (~6%) is speculation.

Maybe a 25% correction?
1222 2018-11-12 16:18:21 “Assault style weapons” is 1000x too vague to ever get passed because people on the left and the right have completely different opinions on the definition. High capacity magazines are already illegal in most states. The ban on bump stocks will pass. 1/
1223 2018-11-12 16:17:43 When will I buy stocks? Well, when the US Government finally bans criminal #StockBuybacks and the market drops about 10,000 points, I'll start buying companies that value their employees and the future of the company!
1224 2018-11-12 16:17:37 Hypotherically no one that believes in stocks like TWLO for example will have any money left to buy when/if it hits 10  because they will be fully invested much higher bc they  are wrapped in fundamental hype
1225 2018-11-12 16:17:32 None of the corn or soybeans in that contry and wheat for that matter will never come out on to the market but they say it will and I think if my numbers are correct they have 159 million metric tons of corn on ending stocks that will use

1239 2018-11-12 16:13:10 I've always felt that it was a mistake to tie the presidency so closely to an over-extended bull stock market.  Sooner or later the massive correction will come.  And the administration that takes credit for soaring stocks will be punished by the voters when it collapses.

1304 2018-11-12 15:53:41 The difference between last season's Barça & this one makes me think of Bonds vs Stocks investing.

Bonds : not sexy, lower risk, you get a guaranteed interest, but it's a very low return.

Stocks : fun, risky, you may gain 100%, you may lose 100%, it's a roller-coaster.
1305 2018-11-12 15:53:09 Stocks are falling because of the failed economic policies of the @GOP and the @realDonaldTrump admin.

1769 2018-11-12 11:27:27 That too but I mean they said the game didn't sell enough copies. And they're planning to add more microtransactions to compensate.

A lot of the gloom over their stocks is basically bad timing with the tax cut shit backfiring and tanking the stock market though.
1770 2018-11-12 11:26:38 I don't even know where to get stocks and flogging seems like a lot of work. I moreso meant if they get to say 8 or 9 wins I get that staff changes are unlikely, but I hope they still put better oversight on the OC's staff hiring. Alexander and Kellen Moore have been bad.

1811 2018-11-12 10:35:35 20. Expect market volatility, but avoid portfolio volatility. Be prepared financially (cash reserves) and psychologically to buy more of the quality stocks in your portfolio when stock prices take a hit. Be prepared to sell your more expensive valuations when markets are frothy.

1814 2018-11-12 10:33:58 17. Avoid over diversification. Don’t own too many small positions or so many stocks that you become an index fund. This assures average performance and keeps you from owning only the very best opportunities. #finance

1848 2018-11-12 09:51:03 While that’s certainly true, the report suggests “it is more efficient to strategically avoid the many underperforming stocks”, rather than trying to identify the top performing stocks, so yes research is very important but it’s focus on avoiding the downside that really pays off

Don't hear many commentators on near term foreign outlook though.

2055 2018-11-12 05:47:36 Ok so in my opinion, when you only focus on the number of stocks near 52 week high or making a new 52week high & you see this number increasing, that's a bull market already. I don't watch Nifty for that. Hence, I did not feel the need to mention that separately.

2073 2018-11-12 05:29:37 1. How do you decide a proper portion size for each trade?  If your account have $100,000, what would be a proper portion size for $SPY?  What about $SPXL(3 x etf)
2. When you do swing trades(not a buy and hold trade),do you still diversify your trades? Gold, bonds and stocks,etc

2110 2018-11-12 04:45:07 It makes more sense than wasting a lot of money sending the nitwit to prison. A few humiliating weeks in the stocks followed by a few hundred hours community service (I’ll gladly supervise-armed with a bull whip) will amply demonstrate his folly and help him mend his ways.

2134 2018-11-12 04:10:27 Yes they do. They put their investment into these businesses and invested into others to further make more money. I’m sure you would do the same if you had a successful product and were willing to invest into other stocks knowing they could collapse tomorrow.
2135 2018-11-12 04:09:00 Nerlens been lowkey balling in OKC. 2.5 stocks/game in just under 14 mpg is insane. His equally ridiculous 2.9 fouls/game (7.5 per 36) pretty much relegates him to backup, but man what a productive backup. If he keeps this up, someone’s giving him a multi-year deal next summer.

2139 2018-11-12 04:06:08 But making it easier to get a near-military grade weapon than a driver’s license is ludicrous. Background checks, fingerprinting, waiting periods, banning assault rifles and bump stocks...  sensible regulation is not contrary to the 2nd Amendment.
2140 2018-11-12 04:06:05 Ain’t arguing that at all. See my second tweet. Just disliked bringing stocks in to say: oh don’t worry about inflation. Not really meant as support for crypto tho. 
2141 2018-11-12 04:04:14 I can see why you would speculate that.. However, I believe that a correction to the market will happen (perfectly normal) and there will be individual stocks that will tank once arrests start being made but he has work his way up before & he would not risk it w/world watching..
2142 2018-11-12 04:02:58 He won't overvalue anything he buys good stocks when they are undervalued and he won't hurry to invest and take a risk .his policy is wait many things take time to develop .even if we have any amount of money a baby can only be delivered in 10 months only

2149 2018-11-12 03:57:28 I'm not long or short biased on any stocks that I'm watching. I change my mind on direction all the time, and if I don't like the price action I don't trade it.
2150 2018-11-12 03:56:48 You out here buying tickets like they're stocks 

Shorting that market
2151 2018-11-12 03:55:21 Chinese households have very high savings and there just isn't enough investment opportunities onshore. Cash loses to inflation and stocks are too volatile. So is corporate credit. That is why most store their savings in homes. It is an inflation hedge and inheritance
2152 2018-11-12 03:54:56 100 million dollars or some shares in Starbucks stocks and you got yourself a deal 
2153 2018-11-12 03:54:51 It is obvious what happens is written in the indictment, and what has not been made Public yet, which by the way is the reason why I bought stocks in Immodium
2154 2018-11-12 03:53:23 I'm sure they've bought stocks and profited during war, it's all part of trickle down economics.
2155 2018-11-12 03:53:08 Oh the dude that told people to buy the top of stocks and not buy the dip of Crypto in September. 
Does he still believe in his target of 1k per BTC?
2156 2018-11-12 03:52:25 Yay definitely should negate inflation (if not perfectly or guaranteed.) My real point was basically: cash is a core financial need and investing (crypto, stocks) is not and most people need to deal with the core need first.
2157 2018-11-12 03:52:01 Defensive motor can be different than a motor in general. Definitely a hyperbolic comp but would you say that Dwight Howard has a motor/IQ/technique because of his rebounds and stocks? I think Shittu is good in passing lanes but that goes to Cam’s N&S over lateral aginiltt point
2158 2018-11-12 03:51:39 Compare the options each provider offers for placing buy and sell orders. Can you place limit and market orders? Are stop loss orders available to help you minimise investment losses? #OnlineTrading #InvestSmart #Stocks
2159 2018-11-12 03:51:20 I wanna be 18, to buy stocks lol
2160 2018-11-12 03:49:39 Bottom line, this wasn't an average day trader that got hit by unexpected routing fees, this was most probably a computer trading HFT and abusing the Tradenet system, causing them to raise the spreads on low float stocks with 3c.
2161 2018-11-12 03:49:14 Up 50% from the $800 peak in early 80’s. 

Dow bought at high of 2740 in 87 - up 8 fold plus 30 years of dividends. 

I’ll stick with stocks for long term.

2164 2018-11-12 03:48:26 He gets a ton of rebounds and stocks so he cannot be missing ALL of the motor/IQ/technique. He has to have something.

Naz Reid I don't have high hopes for. Suspect he will be too chuckerish on offense, although he becomes interesting if his shooting is real and he limits TOVs
2165 2018-11-12 03:48:04 Make sure you can easily contact the share trading platform provider if you ever have a question about your account or a problem with a trade.

2188 2018-11-12 03:29:22 You should also be aware that brokerage fees vary across international stock exchanges, so the fee for buying shares on the TSX may differ from the brokerage charged when you buy shares through the New York Stock Exchange, for example. #InvestSmart #OnlineTrading #Stocks

2190 2018-11-12 03:28:27 If you want to ‘consistently’ ride 10-50% moves in a very ‘short’ period of time, focus only on stocks closer to their 52week high point. DISCARD everything else.

2193 2018-11-12 03:28:11 I have only ever traded penny stocks in my tfsa since its inception! 
I have paid taxes once from my tfsa and that was due to profits incurred from over contribution on my part.
2194 2018-11-12 03:27:51 If it weren't for my desire to watch multiple time frames at once, none of this is necessary.  Usually monitoring 1min 5min 15min hourly & daily on at least two stocks.

2196 2018-11-12 03:26:14 From time to time, some online stock trading providers will offer special deals to help you save on brokerage fees or possibly avoid them altogether. #OnlineTrading #InvestSmart #Stocks #tradegoose

2200 2018-11-12 03:23:39 It’s important to consider your trading habits when comparing brokers, as this can have a huge impact on the cost of each transaction. You’ll need to take into account not only how often you trade but also the size of the trades you place.  #OnlineTrading #InvestSmart #Stocks
2201 2018-11-12 03:23:13 To be honest majority of hedge funds don't even touch stocks this small. In event that they do take a million to it, they alone can drop the stock. Doesn't take much. Low float.

2233 2018-11-12 02:57:02 I hear ya, 
Makes sense.
I do however use volume in my scans. Stocks that are trading 2 or 3x normal volume usually creat a great environment for a day trade.
2234 2018-11-12 02:56:06 It’s still ripe. Great time to buy. There’s a handful of large catalyst factors that have yet to happen. $KGKG
2235 2018-11-12 02:55:52 I wouldn't expect strong negative correlation in the short term. It's a fairly concentrated portfolio with a significant number of smaller stocks - and correspondingly significant share price volatility. Over longer periods, though, returns have shown relatively low correlation

2240 2018-11-12 02:52:51 This was a tough week for the grains.  Surprisingly it was not USDA’s report that pressured, it was expectations for harvest activity, a stronger US dollar, and declining demand.  Let’s not forgot the market’s concerns from China’s new Crop Production and stocks estimates

I’m at $19,654. I have only 22 stocks. I think you might be impressed of a return of +1,140.43%, keep in mind not normal
2254 2018-11-12 02:42:17 European shares fell as mining and oil stocks sold off and weak earnings results weighed on sentiment. German steel giant Thyssenkrupp plunged 9.2% to its lowest levels since July 2016 after cutting its profit outlook for the second time this year
2255 2018-11-12 02:41:46 Tech stocks fell amid renewed concerns about the earnings outlook for the sector – @Facebook and @Microsoft slumped 2.0%, @Apple sank 1.9%, @Google-owner Alphabet slid 1.6% and @Twitter lost 0.3%, while online retailers @Netflix dived 4.6% and @Amazon dropped 2.4%.
2256 2018-11-12 02:41:30 10-15% drop within the next 45 days. I don't think it will be back at highs absent "funding secured 2.0". Too much priced in. From this point, the headwind gets progressively worse for all stocks, TSLA is among the most sensible to fin conditions. The tide is turning for tech...
2257 2018-11-12 02:41:26 Energy stocks saw particular weakness following the recent fall in crude oil prices as @Schlumberger dropped 2.3%, @Halliburton slipped 1.1% and @ConocoPhillips lost 0.3%, although @Chevron gained 0.1% and @Occidental jumped 1.3%.
2258 2018-11-12 02:41:12 US stocks fell on Friday after a sell-off in oil, a worse-than-expected reading on producer prices and uneasiness about the housing market resurrected fears of an uncertain path for the economy

2271 2018-11-12 02:31:49 I am leaning towards that line of thinking too. Many Large Cap stocks already have a death cross or about to, SPX is lagging only because it holds tons of defensive stocks like utilities and healthcare. Sooner or later it will catch up with the general Bearish trend IMO.

2301 2018-11-12 01:48:00 Bump stocks are a gimmick....yes they can increase rate of fire..but not accuracy...banning them does nothing it was a "easy" "compromise"...I can easily out shoot any idiot with a bump stock and be more accurate with with 10 round than he/she can be with 30
2302 2018-11-12 01:47:58 it’s simple. the money printing increased the price of assets (by design), and the inflation was in stocks, bonds and real estate.  Rich people hoarded the gains, while poor people didn’t get any boost to  encourage increase of consumption, so consumer prices remained flat
2303 2018-11-12 01:45:12 What kind of arms are protected by the second amendment, granted bump stocks didn't exist when it was written?

2347 2018-11-12 00:58:19 Online dating is like scanning for stocks.  Narrow down the list of potential candidate to find the ones best suited to your objectives.
2348 2018-11-12 00:58:10 TBH i think they're hated more now. Back then the emotion was resignation, today there's seething resentment about many (so-called) leader stocks that ignored the lessons they should have learned & went str8 back to the old ways when the FY16 rebound came. Hated is the mot juste.
2349 2018-11-12 00:52:54 @M1_Finance I'm working on my Christmas list and would love to give fractional stocks to my family and friends.  Do you offer any way to GIFT through ME?  Gift card?  eCards?  Etc.?
2350 2018-11-12 00:52:41 You and your Orange Menace were treated like pariahs. You are both global laughing stocks .
2351 2018-11-12 00:52:20 It'll be like bump stocks, what, maybe a dozen turned in since they've been banned?
2352 2018-11-12 00:49:10 I should have gotten into stocks YEARS ago. You could spend legit, $50, do your research and let your money do work.
2353 2018-11-12 00:48:50 So... apparently there is only 1 brand of shoes in existence that is big enough for my feet in retail stores across Australia... (Big as in wide enough). and out of all the stores that stocks them. only 1 actually has them in stock. and they just happen to be close to uni... wut!

2355 2018-11-12 00:47:33 Hi, my American friend is finding it difficult to find a planner in his local Staples. Can you please tell me which Staples near zip code 20164 stocks it?
2356 2018-11-12 00:44:55 Not that I thibk XRP will hit that high, but market cap isn't really a reason for it not to. Crypto market caps don't measure real metrics like assets or profit potential like they do with stocks. They're more like derivatives, whose market is over $500 Trillion currently.
2357 2018-11-12 00:44:12 Don’t flatter yourself, had completely forgotten all about you and your take on $PM. I have no issue with differing views on stocks, not grounds for animosity IMO, though I realize idiots resort to it gladly. Explains the conspiracy peddling, which earns you my absolute contempt.
2358 2018-11-12 00:43:09 These are stocks they bought with money created out of thin air?  I think they still came out ok.  Make them buy in gold and then they'd really feel the loss.  #crazystupidfiatworld
2359 2018-11-12 00:42:59 In general stocks rise with economic growth.  So making a bullish call 20 years out isn't exactly ballsy. It just looks like another example of the justification the "buy and hold" crowd use to keep retail in the market. I like to time markets and I'm not bullish here.
2360 2018-11-12 00:39:39 Obviously the complete solution is much larger than just bump stocks but it's a start. There have been cases where gun manufacturers intentionally make rifles that can be easily modified to be semi or full autos.
2361 2018-11-12 00:37:14 Yours is temporary. His isn't. Most of America do not own stocks or have a 401k.
2362 2018-11-12 00:36:24 What does that have to do with my point that banning bump stocks and cracking down on said ban will help prevent mass shootings? Do you think that isn't true?
2363 2018-11-12 00:34:19 we ain't ready for optimal melee yet

2364 2018-11-12 00:31:11 1980 is a tough comparison. The Soviets had just invaded Afghanistan and gold surged. But I have a couple of observations. 1) US stocks are currently very overvalued 2) Since 1980 we've developed a whole range of alternatives to gold as a hedge to political tension/inflation.
2365 2018-11-12 00:28:55 Over the weekend I tried to scan some stocks that I think good to enter. I saw $SSI and it's very interesting since I spotted a 200 SMA and 50 SMA crossover that is about to happen. A very strong signal for my TA to enter.  #traderlifeph #dailygrind #pse #psei
2366 2018-11-12 00:28:44 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $BG, $BGFV, $COHU, $VNOM, all may climb w/in 8, 15, 7, 13 days up to 2%, 4.6%, 8.5%, 8.4% respectively 
2367 2018-11-12 00:28:32 $21,000 today. This is my third best day this year with the top two coming from stocks.
2368 2018-11-12 00:25:11 Worst panic in dry bulk stocks could be over as BHP reportedly re starts after train accident. Hopefully recent weak rates starts scrapping and stops ordering for a potential nice buying opportunity late summer 2019.
2369 2018-11-12 00:23:49 Become a bond trader. They take every opportunity to gtfo. Bonds closed stocks open. 

Fun fact:

The stock market used to observe Veterans Day with a brief two-minute shutdown from 1954 to 2006, but that ended in 2007.
2370 2018-11-12 00:23:04 Crude Oil Prices Eye Weekend OPEC Meet, Asia Stocks May Boost JPY: Fed sent Asia, Europe and US stocks tumbling as USD rose. GBP fell on Brexit woes as UK’s Jo Johnson resigned. Crude oil prices look to weekend OPEC meeting as Asia stocks may fall.
2371 2018-11-12 00:23:03 @bikechain Yes Stocks open Bonds closed Vet day
2372 2018-11-12 00:21:58 You know the guy in the Bud Light who refuses the Bud Light and insists on better shit and then gets locked in the stocks? That guy are Texas Democrats. Hang in there. You’re right. Bud Light and Ted Cruz both suck.
2373 2018-11-12 00:21:11 I encourage ppl to take $200 to invest in stocks and forget about it! You pay for much more and forget about it... why not give yourself a chance at building wealth!
2374 2018-11-12 00:19:58 History only matters to me when comparing the macro data. I never simply look at what stocks did historically without also comparing the data backdrop. I don’t expect a Santa Claus rally as the data doesn’t support one as it does most other years.
2375 2018-11-12 00:19:21 Pure embarrassing. Clearly you crave the attention as there's no way any self-respecting Newcastle fan would let this see the light of day. You're willing to let the club be seen as laughing stocks for personal gain. Absolute stamp collectors, the both of you.
2376 2018-11-12 00:17:54 The actual truth is investors bid up growth stocks when growth in general is middling. P/E ratios and balance sheets be damned
2377 2018-11-12 00:16:34 Either one of those scenarios are not beneficial to stocks.
2378 2018-11-12 00:16:07 I am not saying business is not doing well.  I just believe the environment for stocks has now turned toxic. The fed has to continue to wind down that b/s.  If they stop, they are admitting that the economy is in danger.  If they don't stop, rates have to continue to go up...

2380 2018-11-12 00:14:10 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
2381 2018-11-12 00:13:36 apple stocks rise by 69%.
2382 2018-11-12 00:08:32 He knows you ain't learn how to trade stocks yet and he's trying to smack you into action 
2383 2018-11-12 00:04:05 Or see if the store people know (we have a store here called Reynolds Advanced Materials that basically just stocks smooth on) and then explain your project and they can help you find the right material. Smooth-on sells sample kits, too.
2384 2018-11-12 00:04:02 Happy Anniversary! Thank you so much for the information on diversifying.  I never had clear understanding of the importance of including stocks and bonds in your profolio.
2385 2018-11-12 00:03:28 Want to learn more about real estate and stocks I definitely need a side hustle
2386 2018-11-12 00:03:04 Could be a interesting week for Pot stocks with 2 of the biggest players reporting Earnings TLRY & CGC
2387 2018-11-12 00:02:31 So you need to find an art store that stocks them, and then see if that art store can do special orders. Shipping from smooth on directly is just cost prohibitive since it's chemicals. That said, if you can get it locally, you can then actually call the factory (in Penn)
