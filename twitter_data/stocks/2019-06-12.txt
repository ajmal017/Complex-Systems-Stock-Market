6 2019-06-12 23:57:44 i am frustrated that nintendo’s stocks dropped after the animal crossing delay announcement, because i worry that it will deter companies from doing the same in the future.

9 2019-06-12 23:56:49 @AmitShah dear mr minister ..sir I am sensing unscrupulous activity against public sector stocks at clsa . They are targeting our Indian oil companies .. Vikas Jain analyst writes reports totally false untrue and biased reports .. markets it globally and hammers India blue chips.
10 2019-06-12 23:56:45 Nope they don't while they can't see that you /family/Republicans make fortunes by constantly flipping stocks.

13 2019-06-12 23:54:21 Well what’s bigger 10% of million or 10% of a thousand, with loopholes some can pay less. So how about a flat tax of likes say 10% for everyone from people who work in stocks, corporations & individual people of all income levels with no loopholes for anyone.
14 2019-06-12 23:53:58 The new era. A stock broker closed my account with stocks in it.

Thanks TD Waterhouse.
15 2019-06-12 23:53:06 Which, I should side note, does have a lot to do with sexism. Take teachers for example. Typically seen as a “women’s” job. They don’t make shit compared to an accountant for some company or someone who sells and buys stocks. I’d argue teaching is a way tougher job no doubt
