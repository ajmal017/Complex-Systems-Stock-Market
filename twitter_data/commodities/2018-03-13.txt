Some Uk farms already more than capable of producing food without subsidy & without tariff protection. Why should UK consumers pay over the odds and lose environment?

14 2018-03-13 22:34:23 That also goes for seeking patents for commodities. A waste of time. We are focused on not letting secrets out about products we may not need in 5 years. We should focus on innovating our products, make them experiential and develop the brand.
15 2018-03-13 22:33:05 No. But agri-products like oil are commodities   The price is the same anywhere in the world after transportation and tax.

41 2018-03-13 22:19:27 What happened to the Philippine economy? Tax imposed on basic commodities is questionable and I strongly believe that it will not do any good to the Filipino people. TRAIN law is favorable only to the rich, while it is really a burden to the masses.

50 2018-03-13 21:08:09 The commodities are getting rejected, this may be already leading the market lower. Stocks may test the highs 1-2 times more this week as the breadth has been strong so far, but the seasonality is also turning down in the second half of March... $DBX $SPX
51 2018-03-13 21:05:05 GDP is indeed concentrated in ports, which TEND to be on coasts. True. But what is GDP based on? Commodities, timber, agriculture, mining, energy resources, & people power. She might as well say that milk comes from the store. That only reflects the end point of the transaction.
52 2018-03-13 20:58:08 I’ve owned it for years and never made any money. I do like commodities rn especially oil.
53 2018-03-13 20:36:59 Totally tragic, these poor horses. Bred so that their bone density is practicaly zero, coveted all the time they are winning, then binned when they don't and shot when a leg breaks. If they truly loved them why not fix the legs. They are just commodities to use and abuse.
54 2018-03-13 20:33:47 Really like this idea. However, I'm curious as to why they want to exclude potential security tokens and platforms? Makes sense in that they directed this to the CFTC, but I think not having both security tokens and commodities covered leavs potential for a fractured regime.
55 2018-03-13 20:21:32 I'll agree with you that this is an example of "intrinsic" value. :) In this and similar cases with silver they are functioning as commodities.

Money is a concept: it is a measurement of time, energy, and value all with a foundation of trust.

78 2018-03-13 18:17:10 I don't believe we need funding from donor countries. These r not donations as they come with strings attached. I believe we have valuable commodities which if properly managed can get us on a different level. Unfortunately our leaders are complicit in robbing us of our heritage.
79 2018-03-13 18:07:47 I've already been speaking to VC's from the City, and Traders from the commodities markets.

87 2018-03-13 17:41:16 From my understanding @sophwilkinson was pondering whether the devaluation of women through hate speech has an impact on producing vulnerable women susceptible to grooming as well as whether this type of rhetoric causes some men to view women as mere sexual commodities.

93 2018-03-13 17:11:02 Yes it’s unfortunate to say the least that the explicit policy of all Governments since 1997 has been to destroy at least 2% of the value of our currency every year. A fully convertible currency linked to basket of commodities would be better way to maintain value

125 2018-03-13 14:45:24 @ravi_mehata sir can I buy Godfrey for medium term. Agri commodities are on lower prices that may reduce input cost?
126 2018-03-13 14:44:39 All animals are somebody—someone with a life of their own. Behind those eyes is a story. In our culture, we have been encouraged to think of animals as things, as commodities. The great challenge lies in having a change of perception.
127 2018-03-13 14:43:43 One of my commodities sources tells me that steel industry hopeful that CFIUS development huge for steel industry in the sense that it signals Trump admin taking a more aggressive approach.
128 2018-03-13 14:39:36 Thank you for this. You’re not alone. Every year we complain about this & every year no one does a thing. We end up having to warn students & friends privately because when we bring this up so many get defensive. Heavy drinking culture plus idea of writers as commodities, ugh.
129 2018-03-13 14:33:48 When will your greed ever stop?

130 2018-03-13 14:32:58 so, to follow your logic people are interested in superheroes because people are interested in commodities? And what do you mean by commodities - fridge freezers? cars? sandwich toasters? underpants?
131 2018-03-13 14:29:26 my teach keeps saying " commodities " and all i can think about is "what they want from me. dollas lotta stock in me, it ain't nothin personal it's business and i'm a commodity "  @russdiemon
132 2018-03-13 14:28:48 Granted none of my books took three years to write, so maybe that's why I'm a bit more willing to treat them like expendable commodities :)

142 2018-03-13 13:18:09 Growing up on commodities, I couldn't agree more. Your body is less likely to fight illness, can compromise your immune system. You have to pay medical bills you can't afford.

Are Cryptos really Commodities? Maybe a mix of Currency, Equity, Hybrid Security, Bond, etc. Many pay a distribution, offer profit share, pay interest, & they are a means of exchange.

172 2018-03-13 11:26:13 My point re:IVF is that typically it's approached w/ idea that human life is disposable. I'll put my embryos in the freezer indefinitely, pick whether I want a girl or a boy, throw away anyone who has a genetic anomaly, etc. The philosophy of IVF is that children are commodities.
173 2018-03-13 11:24:29 TRAIN law is anti poor. imagine a worker with a minimum wage that feeds 2-3 children, the worker is a victim of unfair capitalism and the price of commodities went high. can the worker still sustain the basic needs of the family?
174 2018-03-13 11:23:22 If I may chip in - it's worth noting that vegan protests aren't against farmers; veganism rejects the notion of animals being seen as food and commodities, and this is what we campaign against.
175 2018-03-13 11:15:45 Falar é mais fácil do que fazer. Enquanto a receita crescia devido ao boom das commodities não fez nada para reformar o sistema tributário.
176 2018-03-13 11:15:41 Wow. I think this is another symptom of the fact that we commodify human beings. Just like with IVF and PP selling baby body parts, etc., this shows that culture views the most vulnerable humans as commodities for their personal benefit. Might makes right. So incredibly sad.
177 2018-03-13 11:07:40 It's partly just markets - Russia's Yamal LNG project in Siberia started up late last year. The UK needs gas, has relatively low supplies, and is paying prices comparable to Asia (with lower shipping times)

But with energy commodities you can never strip politics out completely
178 2018-03-13 11:05:11 Se para entrar estudo e analiso tanto, por que venderia? A empresa ou o negócio deixou de ser bom?
Tenho uma “bronca” com a tal “realização de lucros”. Isto é como tratar empresas como commodities. Compra, estoca e vende. Se “renda variável” é isto, então fluxo é o q importa.
179 2018-03-13 10:55:25 It's almost like property ownership and profit potential are better incentives to produce even basic commodities.

229 2018-03-13 05:38:52 One of the main problem our farmer faces is the MSP while we, end-users, face is  price hike of commodities. It's the middle man who's minting money. If this issue is addressed, nearly 75 to 80% of the problems will be sorted out. #KisanLongMorcha

2. Those looking for prices of various equities and commodities.

Guess which one would be having a better phone in future.

Also, it is a currency supported by commodities like oil.

239 2018-03-13 04:43:53 It's the unfortunate culture ... lack of self belief! We tend to look upto the "Foreign" things. Be it people, commodities or even values.

Reality shows this is false, since I can have legit reasons to hold my money and not spend it.

254 2018-03-13 03:07:59 After all, the supposed 'law' that Jean-Baptiste Say propagated, claims that money is only useful as a tool of exchange for commodities, which according to the Austrian School is obviously false, as cash-building and investing are ways to hold money without buying commodities.

264 2018-03-13 02:17:30 Oh I gotchu and I feel you. Yeah, I seems like our stories have  recently been turned into commodities for people to feel good for helping a minority case so I’m also tired of sharing them that way. I think our stories are for us to use as motivation.

266 2018-03-13 02:13:02 Lou ask these so called free trader politicians why they don't get upset when these hedge funds manipulate the commodities market to increase the prices which has added anywhere from 25 to 50 percent to the prices of goods

Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by opinions when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking.
277 2018-03-13 01:12:42 Si siguen vendiendo dólares para atrasar más el tipo de cambio no van a quedar productores en pie para el año que viene . Nueva Zelanda y Australia cuando tienen sequía o bajan precios de los commodities dejan que se devalúe su moneda. Acá hacen al revés . Delirio

280 2018-03-13 00:49:00 Es la típica jugada pre-campaña.
Los bancos hacen “vaquita” y los senadores alivian sus gastos de campaña. Secuestro express de cash.
Favero & Cia. ya hicieron lo mismo con el otro clásico de cada lustro: el amague de gravar más duro la exportación de commodities agrícolas.
281 2018-03-13 00:45:41 Also, pretending that things like health care and education aren't commodities doesn't actually make them non-commodities.  It just smothers the signals that commodity-filled markets use to mark success and failure, leading to inevitable failure.

285 2018-03-13 00:25:20 I'm just going to keep saying this until everyone knows it. #Amazon sells books at a loss. This is their original business model. They can do this because they make so much money on everything else. To them, books are not real commodities worth real money
286 2018-03-13 00:16:07 Yeah, Ben - it couldn't have anything to do with @realDonaldTrump holding as many as five rallies a day,  or appealing to (now former) democrats.

289 2018-03-13 00:06:53 You're making a fair argument. In the case aforementioned, the government is reacting to changes in commodities prices on the stock market. Many experts on the ground can attest that our output production costs in the mining sector is HIGH.
