1 2018-04-08 23:49:10 Commodities are similar to cash; fungible. Here is the proof
2 2018-04-08 23:42:43 It’s an interesting one. I just can’t see this bull dying anytime soon. Relative strength in stocks is just too much. As much as my bullish commodities call gets me in the opportunity cost capital feels, I must hedge with long equities...
3 2018-04-08 23:33:35 And isn’t it true that commodities and their ensuing contracts are negotiated now, hence farmers and users of products are screwed today?
4 2018-04-08 23:31:20 IMF wrote a white paper in 2011 under DSK discussing pricing "commodities like oil and gold in SDR's".  In a bit of bad luck, 3 mths later DSK was arrested in the US on assault charges and later ceased being head of IMF.
5 2018-04-08 23:16:42 Academics are cowards who allow the capitalists to turn their minds into commodities, churning out new commodities (students).
6 2018-04-08 23:10:48 President Trump is not the cause of the latest tension between China & America, he is trying to fix it! Chinese been taking advantage of US for decades, dumping commodities on world markets & stealing intellectual property from us. Other countries Japan & EU supporting America.
7 2018-04-08 23:09:53 What I see happening is the biggest bust since the Great Depression and is already in progress... All asset classes and commodities will be severely battered
8 2018-04-08 23:07:33 True. And this to me is an example of something I've talked about in the TL before where we engage African heritage, culture, and their products writ large as commodities to be horded or bought/sold. Acting like this a zero sum game as if we can't all eat and prosper.
9 2018-04-08 23:06:16 Ravena eu te entendo, mas seu pai não deve agradecer APENAS ao lula, e sim ao SUPERCICLO DAS COMMODITIES BRASILEIRAS, que alavancou a economia, nos tornando o 5º ou 7º país que mais lucrava no mundo ;)
10 2018-04-08 23:05:33 That needs to change... For UK & others.

Goods only trade deals are an anachronism.

Businesses involved solely in trading commodities are vulnerable to the slightest ...relative change in circumstances.

Nothing clever can be done if things don’t go your way.

This I know......

15 2018-04-08 22:15:29 I hate the stress of living paycheck to paycheck between me and my mom I hate that every time I complain about being poor someone wants to tell me how im supposed to live such and such way for my struggles to be valid that unless I keep myself from certain commodities being poor
16 2018-04-08 22:08:17 E sério, qualquer pessoa q entenda de economia sabe que os 'avanços sociais' no país foi pq Lula estava nadando em dinheiro de commodities (soja e minério de ferro), reconheceu a China como economia de mercado e criou vários desequilíbrios na economia q estouraram na mão da Dilma

18 2018-04-08 21:43:58 Your argument is based on the price of commodities in PH? Do you know that from Obalende to Tinubu is 50 bucks and from Tinubu to Orile is also 50 bucks? From Obalende to Tom Jones is 100 bucks and From Tom Jones to Mile 2 is also 100 bucks? Don't talk about recession.

38 2018-04-08 21:41:48 China’s rebalancing - from being an investment- and manufacturing-driven economy to a more  consumer- oriented one - has meant that its voracious appetite for commodities has subsided, leaving many African economies in a tailspin.
39 2018-04-08 21:34:36 You accuse everyone when elections come we accuse u? Tell PM Saab to reduce fuel prices and try to create jobs for youths only telling jumlaas don't full our stomach without reducing fuel prices other commodities prices will never reduce. Only politics since 4 years but work is 0

41 2018-04-08 21:25:29 I just don't see an analogy between Uber taxes and regulation and taxes on commodities, I'm afraid.
42 2018-04-08 21:15:59 "TIME" time is the single most precious commodities in the universe. Use your time wisely.
43 2018-04-08 21:09:57 It totally beyond ok to not know the things about which I'm ranting- it is never ever too late to learn!

It's when people go out of their way to perpetuate blatant lies about one of the most consumed commodities in the world because of a fake ego boost that I get enraged.
44 2018-04-08 21:05:39 17 milhões de toneladas da commodities produzidas só no nosso estado. Orgulho de saber que trabalho em um dos ramos que puxa pra frente a economia desse país. Parabéns a todos os produtores.
45 2018-04-08 20:57:56 My OH, works in sales, always asks why education expects all our sprinters to be Usain Bolts? His sales targets are contextualised, by outlet demography etc, so they are high but realistic. Not saying ch are commodities etc but if business can ‘control’ for variables....
46 2018-04-08 20:54:51 A fanfic da direita:  lula surfou nas commodities,queridos o país viveu,vive e vivera de commodities,NÓS alimentamos o PLANETA,como produtores recordistas d alimentos. Até Deus ajudou o país no período do governo dele,o que ele poderia fazer,n aceitar o boom econômico? se poupem.
47 2018-04-08 20:51:44 The #rising #PurchasingPower of the  #developing #world (#EmergingMarkets) means that over time they increasingly and more effectively #compete for #commodities with the #developed world.
48 2018-04-08 20:30:51 I like the take on commodities...I know folks that swear by hard asset ETFs,  I've been convinced too...but niu more than 5%. DBC I think...not the best returns...but oh well lol.
49 2018-04-08 20:21:05 And ofcourse there are platforms that brings together the farming community helping farmers in selling, buying and exchanging agriculture commodities and services locally and internationally without middlemen right from their location. #AgricClubMediaChat
50 2018-04-08 20:07:03 They  get  treated  like consumers and commodities by unrestrained capitalist ogres.
51 2018-04-08 19:52:52 Btw, they did it with ZERO mineral wealth, oil, commodities to export or tourism. Venezuala vs Singapore. Thats the difference between free market, and radical socialism. Evidence that Ernst is merely factually pointing out. Now, whats our exscuse again?
52 2018-04-08 19:52:27 Cows are very affectionate but the Dairy and Agriculture lobbyists don’t want you to think of them as sentient beings. Instead, Factory Farmers want you to see them as emotionless commodities, resources to be used up.  Same way China views its cats and dogs: use for food and fur.
53 2018-04-08 19:42:39 Well the modern incarnation of what we see today came largely out of the Wilson era with the advent of modern propaganda. Couple that with the MIC creation during WW2 and you've got the perfect storm where constituents are political commodities and little else.
54 2018-04-08 19:42:31 O post é ótimo, porque demonstra como as pessoas percebem eventuais melhorias em suas vidas, associando ao governo de plantão. Qualquer um com meio neurônio sabe que a melhoria na economia e no emprego foi fruto do aumento do preço das commodities, de que somos produtores.
55 2018-04-08 19:36:21 yup,  It take's a long time for the effect of tariffs to pass down on commodities . To impose tariffs are one thing, but they are not retro active.  Ana, I would retract your statement,  Being wrong is ok. admitting is a show of honesty.
56 2018-04-08 19:15:51 100%. The only valid critiques of sex work I've seen pertain broadly to capitalism, turning ourselves into commodities, "externalities of social value". The focus on sexwork specifically has everything to do with projected issues around sex and nothing about protecting people.
57 2018-04-08 19:12:30 Quite doubtful that the proposed Chinese tariffs would "rock" the economy or "hurt" US farmers.  These ag commodities are like oil traded on world markets.  Just like the US boycott of Iranian oil simply freed up more Iranian oil for Europe to purchase
58 2018-04-08 19:11:11 @smtraderCA I noticed you don’t follow gold. You mostly follow equities and stay away from commodities and forex?
59 2018-04-08 19:04:34 know how much no mater what it will cost you to save your own life.  Private HC sucks and America is a cruel country to treat humans as commodities.  Healthcare is a right and needed for all.  Single payer is the way to go.
60 2018-04-08 19:03:49 Oil and natural gas are internationally traded commodities - our markets are tied to the world. We’re also exporting some of our product which is great for the economy.
61 2018-04-08 19:02:30 Bill I think one key difference is these previous transitions are based on and limited by commodities - modern renewables have non commodity sources (sun, wind) which makes the comparison not quite apples to apples.
62 2018-04-08 19:00:20 #JobsScam

The CDC has been informed of a WhatsApp message that is doing the rounds relating to the recruitment of workers at one of the Coega SEZ investors - Dynamic Commodities. We would like to inform all our stakeholders that the message is a SCAM and should be disregarded.
63 2018-04-08 18:42:52 For starters...since when does one have to reside in a province to comment on their economy or politics? Makes you a hypocrite! Additionally, Saskatchewan isn’t doing that poorly for a province largely dependent on O&G in addition to other  commodities of course. Well diversified
64 2018-04-08 18:40:07 If America does pull out it gives Russians access to commodities it currently has no control over. 

Our allegiance to oil and Isreal keeps one foot always stuck
65 2018-04-08 18:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.

67 2018-04-08 18:29:26 China has a billion people they need our food, who are you kidding. Another reason for windfall profits when commodities jack up prices and blame POTUS. It’s greed and scare tactics. Soy causes cancer any way. Level the playing field and bring back the middle class. Liberal crap!
68 2018-04-08 18:26:32 People in denial for money who view the innocent as commodities. Shame on them and on those who allow this to happen legally.
69 2018-04-08 17:56:06 Is it because of "unfair trade practices?"Do the American industrialists/producers offer competitive prices to the common consumers in their own country?In fact, it appears it is the Chinese who offer lower prices n masses world over prefer Chinese made goods & commodities.
70 2018-04-08 17:51:42 Hey people, just a small reminder - creators are humans not commodities or cattle or property or whatever.  Please respect them and don’t swarm them or chase them or shout inappropriate things at them.  You’re better than that and they deserve better than that, too. #paxeast2018
71 2018-04-08 17:51:26 Well, whatever happens next, thanks for all the tips! I’ve been able to take what I’ve learnt and not only apply it to crypto but also stocks and commodities, you’ve had a huge positive influence here! 
72 2018-04-08 17:49:15 No! The cruelty has to be stopped! Killing them does not = conservation! Using lions as commodities perpetuates the cruelty and duping tourists into believing otherwise is just wrong on all levels!
73 2018-04-08 17:16:27 Since we solely exist to sell ourselves as commodities in the labor market.
74 2018-04-08 17:15:11 Black males that are single w good jobs and their own place have their pick of women. We are commodities in the community
75 2018-04-08 16:55:41 De lastro nos proporcionou as pedaladas fiscais.
Não se pode negar que a economia vinha crescendo mesmo antes de Lula, e ele tinha o dever de manter(conseguiu, mas era um plano falho).
Surfou na onda das commodities e quando a onda parou, a economia se encontrou neste estado.
76 2018-04-08 16:53:30 Não acreditar que o mercado internacional não pode alavancar um mercado nacional é inocência. A crise de 2008 afetou o mundo todo.
O plano econômico que foi adotado pelo governo do PT não era sustentável a longo termo, pois ele se lastrava na demanda por commodities.
O falto
77 2018-04-08 16:38:55 Because there are new monetary currencies, stocks, real estate and other gold-based commodities entering the global market place daily. This is a very proactive time financially for the average consumer and for communities that learn how to consolidate their spending power.
78 2018-04-08 16:38:13 Real common people (poor and lower middle classes) are bothered mainly about prices of essential commodities like Onion Potato Tomato Banana Rice and various dals. Please check out the prices and the changes of last 1 year.
79 2018-04-08 16:29:51 Dear CM, Country is running in emergency. Price of d commodities r gettin higher everyday. Banks r looted by BJP aides.

83 2018-04-08 15:47:48 The long truth is just finally getting some attention. 

 Facebook users are their product. 

 The people’s  lives, friends, memories and secrets are their commodities.
84 2018-04-08 15:47:42 Do you find ichhimoku to work better with cryptos over stocks and other commodities?
85 2018-04-08 15:46:57 Although in some cases, there's a large difference! I'm a software developer. I don't produce commodities, I produce intellectual property. What I create is sold over and over and over again to clients. I don't see a cent of that recurring revenue that came out of my work.
86 2018-04-08 15:42:27 South Asian men are such an insecure,  culture-less lot.  They thing that as men,  they are born superior and that women are commodities.  That to call a woman as Auntiji is funny. Happens when intelligence n confidence is lacking.  Get well soon,  Mr.  @axmebkhokhar
87 2018-04-08 15:41:52 segundo economistas da oxford p onu, mesmo com commodities em ascensão, a trajetória dos índices de desigualdade no brasil poderiam ter sido diferentes - de modo ruim -  se não fossem as políticas sociais adotadas pelo pt.
88 2018-04-08 15:41:39 On the 'social advances' in the country with Lula: Remember that he was swimming with commodities money (soy and iron ore), recognized China as a market economy and created several imbalances in the economy that burst into the hands of the Dilma.
89 2018-04-08 15:33:19 A política de expansão da renda do governo Lula não era sustentável a longo prazo (dependia do preço/demanda por commodities) e não conseguiram uma alternativa pra ela. Isso gerou o endividamento e as pedaladas no governo Dilma.
90 2018-04-08 15:17:53 Pricing of commodities is done in a daily basis-that affects products. Think of it like gasoline - the price constantly changes even though the gas in the tank at the station was manufactured under a lower price. Supply, demand, forecasting and pricing-how all businesses run
91 2018-04-08 15:07:09 You mean apart from physically looting diamonds, precious commodities, destabiling cultures, killing millions by spreading communal hatred? Yaa we learnt that.
92 2018-04-08 15:07:04 You are creating a tourniquet of agricultural laborers and at the same time you are stopping the flow of agricultural commodities exports.  That to me sounds like a depression in the making.   Tell me how this makes America great again?
93 2018-04-08 15:01:36 Rare commodities are worth more than good

95 2018-04-08 14:55:06 It hasn't translated into economic prosperity. Let's go for the big commodities to compliment
96 2018-04-08 14:32:12 Yes those lovely coalitions that gave us Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96, NAFTA, CTPA, crime bill of 96, Wellfare "reform ", Larry Summers, Arne Duncan, Alan Simpson, Victoria Nuland, Rahm Emanuel, and Tim Geithner.
97 2018-04-08 14:29:57 Profiteering is making prices rise. More Oil than US needs , limited imports & Commodities & Middle men are adding to base price. @EPAScottPruitt  Why is Diesel 90cents more than gasoline/gallon?? @MorningsMaria @Varneyco @TeamCavuto @realDonaldTrump @JrzyJoePiscopo @infowars
98 2018-04-08 14:23:51 US imports goods in exchange for printing dollars. Dollars used to buy commodities priced in dollars only.
99 2018-04-08 14:21:09 China bodes well for commodities!

Handan City in Hebei (annual steel capacity 113MT) has ordered production cut effective 1 April 18

25% cut in steel, coke & coal respectively
20% cut in power & cement
15% cut in ceramic & glass
100 2018-04-08 14:11:53 Apparently, Kudlow hasn't looked at commodities- live hog prices are the lowest in 15 years, bottom dropped out of the soybean market, and even oil prices are expected to take a hit. Idiot.
101 2018-04-08 14:10:43 Would wager the Trump family and friends are shorting stocks and commodities affected by these tariffs. DT appears be trying to drive the market down.

105 2018-04-08 13:48:44 Foi o que você disse. Que era culpa do Lula, quando na verdade não era de nenhum de nós 2. Construção civil e commodities são cofatores para o desenvolvimento a curto e médio prazo. À longo prazo, só investimento em educação e tecnologia, que foi o que os 2 fizeram.
106 2018-04-08 13:43:05 Kkkkkk, these things happen you know. Relevance & public sympathy are two of the most sought after commodities under the sun!
107 2018-04-08 13:41:49 Os investimento em ciência, tecnologia e educação de qualidade foi uma das conquistas dos governos do PT e que a longo prazo, substituiria a essencialidade das commodities. Sim, eles investiram em educação e tecnologia.

109 2018-04-08 13:33:43 Ele estava nadando de braçada em dinheiro de commodities (soja e minério de ferro), reconheceu a China como economia de mercado e criou vários desequilíbrios na economia q estouraram na mão da Dilma
110 2018-04-08 13:19:59 They’re just using it as an excuse to raise prices like we do in the food biz with commodities ... keep shopping around
111 2018-04-08 13:19:39 WHY THE TRADE WAR    NOW  ... AFTER ALL THESE DECADES  ?  #0

w h e n  Iran/Russia/China exchange commodities in non dollars  
 then they will have no need for US bond hedging -> this spells amageddon for USBonds and rates will explode .. no amount of QE could compensate.
112 2018-04-08 12:58:39 Well these atrocities have been going on for 60 years! So let's hope it's the beginning of the end to this heinous practice. I received a letter years ago from Gov saying they were phasing out live export$. It's politics playing with animals as commodities and greed!
113 2018-04-08 12:50:14 So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check
114 2018-04-08 12:44:57 Poor & common men is being looted by the government /&  traders in the name of GST hence it should be only in 3% slab on all commodities.
115 2018-04-08 12:38:09 it doesn't get any simpler than that. if the worker is selling their labour power at a loss to a group who own the means of production so that they can sell commodities at a profit, how could it be anything else but class division? it's baffling that people believe otherwise.
116 2018-04-08 12:33:18 Commodities stood steady with mix of safe-haven appetite and high value risk-aversion but getting the benefit of lack of comfort on equity assets! #Gold tied at inner ring of $1300/1315-1350/1365 and #Brent Crude at $65-70, upper half of revised hedge comfort zone $60-70
117 2018-04-08 12:20:04 Como teria sido o governo maravilhoso dele sem a farra das commodities e a China comprando meio mundo?
118 2018-04-08 12:03:31 Man, I’m so torn on sex work. Of course it should be legal, everyone deserves safety and rights, but also it feeds the hell out of the monster that tells us that women are sexual commodities that should look and act a certain way, also what about those who are forced into it?
119 2018-04-08 11:52:48 Renters are commodities to him - waiting in line ready to cross over 5th Ave, even if they have to step over his gun-shot victim to become his next fire death.
120 2018-04-08 11:46:20 Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange control over $1trillion worth of Africa’s resources in just five commodities –:
1.Oil
2. Gold 
3. Diamonds
4.Coal
5.Platinum
121 2018-04-08 11:41:55 Lager question us which African country would you trust to manage the trade in those commodities?
122 2018-04-08 11:37:25 Because Brent Crude and most commodities are denominated in USD in the global market. INR has depreciated by  18% against USD since 2013. Then the inflation of the raw commodity is additive to this.
123 2018-04-08 11:32:43 Yes I’m madrasa graduate i look at basic necessities of life have you given a thought about price rice in India about all basic commodities from 2014 to 2018?and the rise in unemployment?How much investment has actually come to India apart from MoU’s?What z the industrial growth?
124 2018-04-08 11:27:25 I think the NYT's writer makes some serious points. Asia's 'gentricide', they have far more old people than they do young. The fact that PP and the left treat fetuses as 'commodities'. This is eugenics by any other name.
125 2018-04-08 11:03:48 You had stated "the medical profession" is not a consumer product. Perhaps you meant to state "professionALS" instead of profession? Nevertheless, services are commodities. Hence many providers/hosptitals have rate-your-experiences cards for users to provide feedback.

127 2018-04-08 10:52:43 You need to rethink this you are hurting the people you wanted to help - Commodities, stock market.
128 2018-04-08 10:38:53 That is why I start it. I called the commodities bear bottom back in early 2016 and I have charted many overall roadmaps for the bull market that have started. I will be at my site charting this epic bull market all the way.
129 2018-04-08 10:12:02 Over the next 15-18 mths foresee Currency Wars that could  affect Commodities worldwide. The pot is just brewing!
130 2018-04-08 10:10:19 They’re brilliant at it. Almost $1.70 per kg MS above the “commodity value” even though they mainly sell commodities.... who’d have thunk it 
131 2018-04-08 10:03:13 So the Ultilities will hv to reflect charges so ppl can pay but tht is not going to happen.Will end up with wealthy can pay & pensions/low income will not be able to pay let alone use the commodities.
132 2018-04-08 10:00:56 Agree - just one quibble. While there may be some artisan cauliflower producers, I think most of the smaller producers are quite old fashioned, family businesses producing standard fare /commodities.
133 2018-04-08 09:41:35 Courage & Ahsan two different commodities
134 2018-04-08 09:37:03 The only 'trust' we can build is trust that 'beef' farmers, any farmer, only see animals as objects, commodities.
135 2018-04-08 09:14:18 Opinions are the cheapest commodities in the world.
136 2018-04-08 08:19:46 I’ll go check those good to know thanks.
What I meant is getting your salary paid into xlm, commodities to be listed in xlm and local shops, landlords, basically the whole world accepting xlm as a payment method. You have to create a desperate will and need to buy them somehow
137 2018-04-08 08:16:58 The small field starts the public commodities.
138 2018-04-08 08:16:14 When we procure health care products using methods designed to buy copy paper & commodities, we only end up adding extra risk to an already risky situation. Patients are the ones who suffer every day, for lack of an effective method that puts effectiveness before points & price.
139 2018-04-08 08:01:15 Scarce commodities are more desirable 
...just saying
140 2018-04-08 07:48:36 students bought many boxes of commodities and sold them back in China mainland, to make money as much as several hundreds of thousands of AUD a year by a single person, the highest, as far as I heard. ome kind of "legal " smuggling, I think
141 2018-04-08 07:46:29 How do u know who is being ‘punished’?? Many of us live in regional n rural Australia and STILL disagree with the treatment of animal commodities. ‘I love you. Now get on a ship of torture to yr death, 1 way or another’ u tho!

144 2018-04-08 07:10:10 You have the right to individual liberty. That means taking responsibility for your own choices and not expecting stuff from the state. Healthcare and clean water are not rights but commodities. Safe working conditions are, under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974
145 2018-04-08 07:05:03 3236: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
146 2018-04-08 07:02:05 Also the way billy clarke was ditched.  He said he knew nothing about it and got no call from the club.  Treated as commodities
147 2018-04-08 06:57:12 Stocko imports from Lesotho & Swaziland are a few of our most treasured commodities
148 2018-04-08 06:55:32 I'm from a small farm community in Illinois, population 13,000, who's main commodities are corn and soybeeans.  The main importer of American soybeans is China.  This is the same across IA, KS, NE. How do you keep voting to shoot your own self in the ass?  Blows my mind.

150 2018-04-08 06:45:24 How much are these commodities sold for in 1999 before the PDP came into power?

How much were they sold for when you left power in 2015?..
151 2018-04-08 06:34:20 It's a huge factor. Leads to no care, inadequate care, wrong care, abuse of process, turners users into commodities
152 2018-04-08 06:31:04 The high inflation rate would pose grave danger to the Philippine economy, thus affecting it. And I hope the Government will take firm action in quelling it. Kasi ang mas matatamaan ng mataas na inflation rate in terms of the prime commodities ay yung mga mahihirap.

Tá digamos q isso seja verdade 
1: o lula usou todo dinheiro das commodities pra inflar o populismo dele.
2: essa instabilidade econômica ferrou com milhares de pequenos empresários.
155 2018-04-08 05:51:15 Ainda tenho a opinião que ele não fez 5% do que poderia ter feito E ainda se vangloria disso. Foi o ÚNICO presidente com o apoio do povo, imprensa, empresariado, congresso, com as commodities em alta, e no sertão ainda não tem água potável após 16 anos.
156 2018-04-08 05:42:23 Greyhounds are mere commodities to these subhumans. They're nothing if they can't bring in the $$$. Despicable!
157 2018-04-08 05:27:56 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
158 2018-04-08 05:24:07 Fora que um título bem mais honesto seria trocar “era Lula” por “superciclo de commodities”
159 2018-04-08 05:06:07 Be sensible Mr Tharoor. Don't fall into the trap of @INCIndia social media cell on some fake news. The data you've compared is absolutely wrong. Many essential commodities are way cheaper now than during UPA 2. Petroleum, if comes under GST will be even lower. Check your facts.
160 2018-04-08 04:55:51 My wife is having a problem obtaining citizenship, Her net worth  or mine is not high compared to QIP immigrants. We feel like commodities.

162 2018-04-08 04:26:14 @hillmacmagill the real money isn’t in merchandise it’s in commodities and that’s what Trump is referring to e.g Natural Gas etc.
163 2018-04-08 04:18:45 Fortunately respect is one of those rare commodities that cannot be purchased with currency.
164 2018-04-08 04:08:04 Tá todo mundo feliz ou revoltado com a prisão do Lula, mas vem cá: e o Brasil? Vamos continuar só fornecendo commodities e sabotando nossa indústria? Vamos tirar o sistema carcerário da mão do crime organizado? Vamos crescer de forma sustentável ou continuar matando e poluindo?
165 2018-04-08 04:05:20 1-Os mais antigos argumentam q vida melhorou durante o governo Lula. Não compreendem q o boom das commodities ajudou muito nossa economia e outros países saíram-se melhores q o Brasil p/administração mais eficiente.

170 2018-04-08 03:30:23 Todos los países son afectados por los ciclos económicos internacionales, por las tasas de interés (sobre todo de la FED y Europa), por los precios de los commodities (unos porque son exportadores netos, otros porque son importadores netos).
171 2018-04-08 03:25:26 Thought: Quality of startup MVPs have increased due to code and infrastructure becoming commodities
172 2018-04-08 03:23:12 On April 5,  local time, US President Trump asked the U.S. Trade Representative  Office to study whether to impose additional tariffs on China’s 100  billion U.S. dollar export commodities.
173 2018-04-08 03:22:16 Si sacar a mucha gente de la pobreza es la causa de la persecución, vayan a buscar el precio de las commodities.
174 2018-04-08 03:16:39 Thank god. Lmao. I though lack of grilled commodities and alcohol may have killed you off.
175 2018-04-08 03:03:47 Gurizada falando que o Lula tirou 821468327 trilhões de brasileiros da pobreza
Assumindo que isso tenha sido realmente culpa dele (e não do BOOM das commodities)
Isso faz ele estar acima da lei?
176 2018-04-08 02:57:20 tbh ive moved to equities and commodities a way back
177 2018-04-08 02:43:20 Você tem razão, Bredda. Por isso mesmo recomendei #SUZB3 em R$10 no dia 8/11/2016. Mas isso surgiu de meses e meses de análise. E também #FESA4 a ~R$7. Me criei em pais onde o ciclo de commodities é vital para a economia e, de fato, me especializei  nisso no mestrado.
178 2018-04-08 02:36:18 Agricultural products are commodities. A market exists and the price will not decrease unless China reduces consumption.
179 2018-04-08 02:23:20 Lula foi o ÚNICO presidente com o apoio do povo, da mídia, do congresso, do exterior, além das commodities que estavam em alta, ele fez 5% do que poderia ter feito e ainda se vangloria disso como se fosse um messias. Brasileiro realmente aceita fácil.
180 2018-04-08 02:14:55 Certain Americans generally view them as expendable commodities.
181 2018-04-08 02:05:44 Dualde dejo al país creciendo al 8,8%,Néstor tomo el boom de los commodities y las tasas bajas. Yo personalmente pienso que Néstor fue mínimamente menos peor que Cristina. Pero si contamos que el 30% está desde 2008,que pasó con los 7 años al pedo?
182 2018-04-08 02:02:32 Suponha que em 2003 entrasse um grupo neo-liberal. Também teria surfado na onda dos commodities mas conduziria as políticas de forma a favorecer "multiplicadores de dinheiro" - empresas, indústrias, corporações, que exceto via esmolagem não repartiriam as vacas gordas com pobres
183 2018-04-08 01:58:51 If they adopted them for the income that comes with it, then they were commodities, not something you care to nourish to thrive, but to do the minimum of keeping alive
184 2018-04-08 01:56:21 cara ele nao sabe o que é commodities
185 2018-04-08 01:55:55 Depois disto todos países emergentes e com economia baseada em commodities apanharam (Rússia, Venezuela). E o Brasil teve queda brutal de arrecadação, o que reduziu as fontes de propina e gerou o desgaste com o centrão; tornando o governo petista descartável.
186 2018-04-08 01:53:20 Discordo de você. Não são problemas internos, o Brasil é um reflexo da economia global. Tivemos o auge das commodities no governo Lula e se viveu como se não houvesse amanhã. Veio a crise de 2008 e seguimos bem pelo consumo chinês, até a crise e início da queda das commodities.
187 2018-04-08 01:45:09 Discordo. O Brasil é o país que menos depende de commodities da América do Sul. Talvez o crescimento no mesmo ritmo não fosse mais possível mas a tragédia que vivemos tem raizes na crise geopolítica mundial que começou em 2011.
188 2018-04-08 01:26:37 Maior parte do comércio de exportação da Australia é commodity assim como o Brasil o problema n é esse e sim que o governo nadou da prosperidade gerada pelo aumento das commodities e pela baixa do dólar após a crise de 2008 e n fez nada para sustentar
189 2018-04-08 01:22:40 Additionally, China could begin to make numerous bi-lateral trade deals whereby they pay for imported strategic commodities using RMB, which could then be exchanged for western-sourced gold via exchanges in HK and Dubai, which would then also exert downward pressure on the USD.
190 2018-04-08 01:22:22 Most people fail to understand the import of TPP.  Most tariffs on agricultural commodities are cut by 70% or more.  Most critically, it provides for regulatory harmonization, which will save millions for US business.
191 2018-04-08 01:22:09 No mais: O problema era que, com gasto corrente sendo acrescido por trava na constituição, durante o boom das commodities tudo ficou bem. Mas quando o mercado caiu a receita despencou mas o gastou explodiu.
192 2018-04-08 01:20:20 Nada a ver com crise de 2008 ou ignorância. O ciclo das commodities se encerrou de qualquer maneira, o problema vem de o país ter escolhido ser uma economia de bens primários ao invés de se industrilizar como o Japão fez no pós guerra ou a Coreia fez no final do século passado.
193 2018-04-08 01:19:38 Or the Chinese could select another option: methodically decrease its UST holdings by lending them to resource-rich developing nations, who will use them as they may, but then repay China not in dollars or USTs, but in the form of commodities. In fact, they're already doing this.
194 2018-04-08 01:14:18 Por isso é tão fundamental discutir caminhos para um crescimento sustentado: sem ele, não há como manter políticas sociais. Não podemos e não precisamos ter um país tão grande à completa mercê dos preços de commodities.
195 2018-04-08 01:09:29 Rule #128: Secrets are commodities, sell them.
196 2018-04-08 01:07:42 São Paulo tem tanto dinheiro que não precisaria de boom de commodities para se desenvolver horrores
197 2018-04-08 01:05:39 O povo fala do boom das commodities mas foram eles q decidiram onde botar o $$$
198 2018-04-08 01:04:14 Nada vai apagar os avanços do governo Lula Leon, outros governantes que também "nadassem em dinheiro de commodities" não fariam o mesmo que ele, não investiriam no pobre, no povo.
199 2018-04-08 00:58:15 Maybe we need an Essential Commodities Act to authorize the US govt to buy, stockpile and sell essential commodities whenever events (eg foreign tariffs) threaten our producers and therefore our future supplies. Or maybe a well designed price support program through USDA.
200 2018-04-08 00:55:52 O pessoal acha que o lula tirou do próprio bolso para dar alguns uma televisão ou um celular; vcs são estúpidos os canalhas mesmo? O cara surfou nas commodities e se vangloria por alguns que conquistaram algo não por seus esforços mas por ajuda de governo
201 2018-04-08 00:53:55 The expansion of secure employment during that time was a world fact, specially due to the rise of China and the price of commodities like Iron ore and oil. Not because of Lula.
202 2018-04-08 00:31:26 Luke, any thoughts on metals besides gold, that hold industrial utility/value and is easy to stockpile? Say palladium, silver or copper? With this thesis, all commodities are undervalued no? So what can be stockpiled would theoretically be more bid now?
203 2018-04-08 00:27:20 Then $gold is ready to resume d entrees along with other commodities!
204 2018-04-08 00:10:59 Por supuesto, Macri no tiene los precios pasados de las Commodities para hacer las politicas populistas que pudieron hacer Lula y Cristina, pero eso no lo detiene mucho. Macri manotea ajustando al sector privado vía tarifas mientras mantiene presión impositiva y el Gasto politico
205 2018-04-08 00:08:57 Pienso que no, porque las 4G incentivan economías de escala agroindustriales y sustitución de usos agropecuarios de suelos por extracción de commodities. Sin sistemas alimentarios territoriales robustos las externalidades los ahogan y la financiación de las terciarias se diluye.
206 2018-04-08 00:06:41 O PIB foi muito bem obrigada,tivemos o boom da commodities,muito capital estrangeiro entrando,uma explosão do empresariado brasileiro.
Fora que a politicas de estado,enquanto governo federal fez até o impossível.

208 2018-04-07 23:42:41 my neo-marxist theory of ideology is that you adopt beliefs most congruent to the interests of your industrial organization

Poderia ter modernizado e muito o país, mas decidiu virar bandido. Hoje, vai para a prisão. Justo.

217 2018-04-07 21:55:13 SELL USD, BUY COMMODITIES, I.e. Stop accumulating dollar assets start accumulating real assets. I wouldn't call fx simple imo.
218 2018-04-07 21:52:12 Your fear of life without drugs leads you to fear a future without capitalist commodities.
219 2018-04-07 21:37:43 It's about time to go after commodities trading huge and bigly
220 2018-04-07 21:33:20 No es así en general ahora. Eso pasaba en la época de Moreno.
Pero es bueno refrescar el concepto de que el productor de commodities no exporta por si mismo
221 2018-04-07 21:31:43 Hmmm..commodities take a big hit when ag exports are threatened.
222 2018-04-07 21:29:56 I checked my 401k last week it's up 3k in one week, some just don't realize this slide is more connected to Facebook Alphabet and Amazon dropping...the stock is to dependent on technology and not enough on commodities 
223 2018-04-07 21:28:24 2 das commodities com o ibovespa; c) relação positiva do aumento da base monetária com o crescimento econômico e, portanto, com o ibovespa; 4) em crises, nossa balança comercial gera déficits elevados, o que sinaliza queda no ibovespa...em suma, existem inúmeras

233 2018-04-07 22:16:57 Couldve sworn or someome tweeted posted an interesting chart of basically mega-cycles of the SPX versus some kind of mix of commodities, emerging markets, etc. Now I can't find it. Any ideas?
234 2018-04-07 21:55:13 SELL USD, BUY COMMODITIES, I.e. Stop accumulating dollar assets start accumulating real assets. I wouldn't call fx simple imo.
235 2018-04-07 21:52:12 Your fear of life without drugs leads you to fear a future without capitalist commodities.
236 2018-04-07 21:37:43 It's about time to go after commodities trading huge and bigly
237 2018-04-07 21:33:20 No es así en general ahora. Eso pasaba en la época de Moreno.
Pero es bueno refrescar el concepto de que el productor de commodities no exporta por si mismo
238 2018-04-07 21:31:43 Hmmm..commodities take a big hit when ag exports are threatened.
239 2018-04-07 21:29:56 I checked my 401k last week it's up 3k in one week, some just don't realize this slide is more connected to Facebook Alphabet and Amazon dropping...the stock is to dependent on technology and not enough on commodities 
240 2018-04-07 21:28:24 2 das commodities com o ibovespa; c) relação positiva do aumento da base monetária com o crescimento econômico e, portanto, com o ibovespa; 4) em crises, nossa balança comercial gera déficits elevados, o que sinaliza queda no ibovespa...em suma, existem inúmeras
241 2018-04-07 21:27:19 Why does the peg need to rise? They could just let the price of commodities rise against USD and hence CNY. If they have large stockpiles and ownership of production, then the loss of value via currency is minimised.
242 2018-04-07 21:25:34 La renta la genera la tierra cuando se la cultiva, no los commodities. Espero que no estes estudiando economía, me da escalofríos esa ignorancia.

247 2018-04-07 21:12:37 bravo stefano. Best chart I´ve saw. It says very clearly long commodities short stocks. BUT in the long term. I think it will peak around 7-8 years from 2016 right?
248 2018-04-07 21:11:24 1/ In so far as a commodity is any item that is sold (that is a bagel made for personal consumption is not a commodity, but the same bagel made in a restaurant is) then in a pure communist society, no commodities would exist, as nothing is sold for money. See Kropotkin.
249 2018-04-07 20:54:20 That's only a portion of those who buy. Most buy as a currency or to support the technology. Also, this same argument could be said about most stocks or commodities.
250 2018-04-07 20:32:06 Isn’t this the extension of capitalism, the commodification of everyday life? Is radical left happy fighting for human rights for commodities? Is this new emanciparon?
251 2018-04-07 20:31:19 Dip of price of essential commodities at Big Bazaars of metropolis of India will no doubt a blessing in disguise for Aam Admi while marketing there.
@ProfSudhir
252 2018-04-07 20:25:42 You sir, have no idea.  25% tariff from on beans, corn, cotton and meats is devastating.  Go meet a farmer or commodities broker then let’s talk.
253 2018-04-07 20:23:49 Tangential comment: Ian McDonald's use of air, water, and bandwidth as the key commodities for life on the moon in his Luna series is a fab contemporary sci-fi demonstration of this concept. It shows the reader the things we may be taking for granted.
254 2018-04-07 20:19:34 Fez coisas boas, aproveitou para surfar em um ótimo momento das commodities no mercado (e, mesmo assim, o país cresceu menos do que outros países dependentes daquelas), mas isso não pode o isentar da roubalheira descarada.

258 2018-04-07 20:02:38 Not sure if you're agreeing or disagreeing with me. The definition of generalised commodity production is given in one of the first paragraphs. It isn't just the production of commodities - it's a term that presupposes private ownership of the MoP which didn't exist in the USSR.
259 2018-04-07 19:37:42 oh I can gladly fix it 

if I flouder whole commodities, sectors and industries
I think I can
260 2018-04-07 19:29:09 Need to remember there is a world market with limits on supply. If China buys elsewhere, US will fill that void/shortages. Since China needs commodities, the tariffs will increase costs in China, not US, thus making living in China more expensive. Won’t take long to level markets

263 2018-04-07 19:01:39 it’s almost like markets for human-based services are very different than those for manufactured commodities
264 2018-04-07 18:59:13 This tariff war with China, exposes the US farmers to NAFTA. If NAFTA goes commodities will sink.

266 2018-04-07 18:54:12 Economic models have evolved from (return on property/assets) farming==> return on commodities ==>return on capital ==> return on data. The model for Google/Facebook/Amazon/Netflix maybe even Spotify is to maximize the data they accumulate on users 1/
267 2018-04-07 18:39:23 The fact is China can buy the goods they’ve stated they’ll  place tariffs on, especially the agricultural commodities, from other very eager to fill the gap countries. Where are we going to get our cheap electronics from Donnie? #NoPlanDonScrewsUsAgain!

269 2018-04-07 18:37:22 Commodities, ajuste fiscal, taxa de juros em 26% em 2003, queda do dólar que permitiu que a expansão de crédito do Brasil não gerasse inflação.
Esses são os fatores do crescimento da economia até 2010 - mérito ZERO do Lula. E ZERO relação com "preocupação com os pobres"
270 2018-04-07 18:36:26 There is such a thing. Some coins comprise securities, and insider trading could trigger 10b-5 violations and possible SEC enforcement (and private suits); also under Rule 180.1 the CFTC can pursue insider trading in (crypto) derivatives and commodities in interstate commerce.
271 2018-04-07 18:36:07 There would be a serious price inflation of commodities followed by a substantial drop in the US standard of living to where it's supposed to be.

275 2018-04-07 18:13:35 Mr President you cannot shut off trade with China over night. So putting tariffs on these commodities would increase their prices in shops meaning less trade, less profits, less staff, less staff as consumers and the circle starts again. You do know that don't you?

#DonaldTrump
276 2018-04-07 18:13:32 Ele dá o tamanho que a América Latina merece. Na AL há anos só se faz negócios na base da propina e não se tem segurança jurídica alguma. Os chineses só aceitam esse risco pq nenhum país da região é idiota de perder a parceria do maior comprador de commodities do mundo.
277 2018-04-07 18:09:11 In many ways the 1800's were more advanced then we are today...or at the very least it wasn't as corrupt back in the 1800's. Not to mention that back then honor and integrity were commodities that people strived for
278 2018-04-07 18:08:59 Lula tuvo la suerte de gobernar después de FHC (que ordenó Brasil) y en un período de altos precios de commodities. Nada más. Regaló plata que no es de él y tiene gente sumamente ignorante que cree que eso es progreso, y lo adora. Sigue siendo un sindicalista ladrón y bruto.
279 2018-04-07 18:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
280 2018-04-07 18:06:49 What is unequal trade, and why is it bad? Supply and demand is what drives trade. Companies will go with the supplier that has the goods at the price they can make a profit on. On some commodities the US is competitive and some we’re not.
281 2018-04-07 17:57:16 Alguien tiene gráfico del gasto público brasileño, indexado, q no paró de subir con Lula y q cuando se cayeron los precios récord de las commodities sumió al país de cabeza en la peor recesión de toda su historia?

288 2018-04-07 17:15:29 Why devalue the CNY to sell more goods to western social democracies that require negative real rates to avoid collapsing when you can instead strengthen your own currency v. commodities to spur consumption & growth among your own under-levered incipient consumer class?
289 2018-04-07 17:13:06 Just 5 engineers? What about other Chinese selling commodities illegally? But, why this U-turn? Pak army always insisted that presence of 1 million Chinese in a nation 200 million Pakistanis should not be an issue!

Future oil is STUPID cheap v future USD's, so China's saying "You take the USD's, we'll take the phys oil."

295 2018-04-07 16:37:58 I am describing what the Chinese have been doing.  Americans assume the $80B/mth the Fed once printed was every bit as valuable as $80B as physical oil/copper/gold, etc.  China is simply saying, "OK, if that's true, here you take the paper & we'll take the physical commodities."
296 2018-04-07 16:35:21 En el gobierno de NK hubo superávit solo porque el contexto internacional con tasa americana colapsada y precio de commodities en récord históricos post crisis subprime lo favorecieron, no fue gestión.. que se hizo? Populismo insostenible a largo plazo.

301 2018-04-07 16:21:33 The Hunt Brothers didn't have nuclear weapons & weren't the biggest single trade creditor in the world.  I repeat, control enough physical commodities from that position & you can control the USD.
302 2018-04-07 16:21:16 Way I see it and learnt is that commodities are the stock market. Very few products if any on the market that don't need a commodity to be produced or transported. People tend to forget that. What's your view on intermarket analysis?
303 2018-04-07 16:21:08 No one's even concerned about Kevin's health. All the sarcasm, meanness, & negativity abounding in this account are affecting the players as well. They're merely commodities in this business but they're human beings too & have the right to be treated as such.
304 2018-04-07 16:16:25 i wonder if the regions outside large metro areas wouldn't suffer a lot more. the rural areas of US are far more economically dependent on the coasts than they want to admit.

urban areas depend on the rural areas for a lot fewer vital goods and those goods are commodities

CHINA HAS NO ECONOMY EXCEPT EXPORTS!
316 2018-04-07 15:15:03 The USD rsv status supported by USD's monopoly on oil and commodities is not a free market and China and Russia are changing that.  Monopolists hate when their monopolies are broken.  This will have implications for the US and world.

329 2018-04-07 13:57:10 Compared to europe the US exports relatively few manufactures to China -- if you net out chemicals and add them to classic commodities (ores, fuels, foods, wood pulp, etc), the US split (for goods) is close to 50/50.
330 2018-04-07 13:53:30 A MN perspective: he underestimates the uproar in rural areas over tariff toll on commodities - soybeans, pork. Ag trade orgs issued very strong statements this week. Business groups, too. Midwesterners understand global trade and they know this will hurt the region.
331 2018-04-07 13:51:30 That’s the difference between guaranteed jobs or negative income tax or punitive welfare vs a #UBI. The former treats people as labour commodities (like corn), the later aims to achieve income equality through wealth redistribution, separate income from labor, & increase mobility
332 2018-04-07 13:36:53 Interesting how no one has a problem commodifying NL culture and tradition for those sweet tourism dollars but as soon as the tradition bearers want a few more dollars to afford a few commodities themselves then they are greedy.

344 2018-04-07 12:36:54 This will work when the commodities being traded are digital/electronic.

352 2018-04-07 10:50:02 Again u not serious ! Do u know before demo our banks were about to crush under NPA bubble was about to burst. Hope u understand the dynamics of imported commodities. But other parameters r okey be GDP, inflation, jobs r getting back. But good things our taxes improved after GST
353 2018-04-07 10:47:00 lots of commodities left --

LNG/ crude oil
wood/ paper pulp
copper
plastics/ some basic chemicals

larger planes = helps airbus.  have to import them
chip making apparatus = sets back China's goal of making its own chips
and no intel chips = fewer exports, supply chains move

355 2018-04-07 10:30:47 Ensure that Petrol price should be at Rs.30 a ltr if you bring it under GST. 

For information, it is a mandatory price and bring down the cost 25% on all other commodities. BJP brought 50% up and the same to be brought down by him only.  Ensure Petrol Price "not more than Rs30"

370 2018-04-07 07:32:46 I do agree with your sentiment that the fighters should be renumerated. However, I wouldn't say the UFC is rich - the Fertittas are rich - the UFC has $4bn they need to make up and to do that they cut costs at the expense of the commodities that step inside the Octagon.
371 2018-04-07 07:00:04 USA export Dollar papers to aboard while China commodities are every where in the world,
372 2018-04-07 06:58:26 Trading in dollars is a lot different than trading with the USA.
Almost all oil is traded in dollars yet it doesn't come through the US it's just done in dollars because that's what the Commodities exchanges are denominated in. And we bribe countries to keep it that way!

374 2018-04-07 06:45:53 Well one of the way to measure a investment return is by compare that to inflation Precious Metals works as a hedge against inflation risk for a quiet long time (just like any other commodities).
375 2018-04-07 06:44:14 I think what is also interesting, along with looking at various different commodities, is how these same commodities differ. For example, my sense is there is am interesting difference and similarity between both mine and @mica_amy studies of gold mining.

377 2018-04-07 06:06:28 China bodes well for commodities!

25% cut in steel, coke & coal respectively
20% cut in power & cement
15% cut in ceramic & glass

378 2018-04-07 05:43:10 Even if  you don't want to share the money the way other countries does why don't at least make the essential commodities affordable for the interests of the people that actually owns the money but you choose enrich the rich more ! That's wickedness!
379 2018-04-07 05:36:37 Bearish for commodities specially metals!
380 2018-04-07 05:25:34 ... giving rise to a subjectivity built around the kind of randomly applied notion of socially agreed upon abstract value as the key to subsistence and thus an almost religious, mystified, non-literal understanding of commodities as the main ethos...
381 2018-04-07 05:24:34 That was 2/2 but p.s.: the exchange of commodities of socially agreed upon equal value then insanely you forcibly imposes a valuation on the concrete labor that produces them.  In extension, the sale of labor power (itself a commodity) as the means of subsistence for most....
382 2018-04-07 05:21:36 Shorting commodities is hundreds of years old, enough that it was a joke in pork bellies. China isn't the only, and we likely do the same. Information isn't an American-only game, and if we lose Amazon, Apple, Google, it's game over. (1/2, see next)

384 2018-04-07 05:12:24 Apart from this, a number of development and promotion councils, commissions, boards and corporations have been set up to advise and assist in the growth of specified commodities/industries.
385 2018-04-07 05:05:03 commodities are priced is to retrench workers. 
Draught can go away for good for wheat production to boom,
but it can never be stated with absolute certainty that price of bread can fall back to R6.50 as it was in 2006.Albany is simply faced with a higher wages bill today than
386 2018-04-07 04:46:49 I guess that depends what currency is your base.  For now, in dollar terms, I think yes.  Bc I think dollar and equities rise together.  I don’t think commodities (in $ terms) break out yet.  But in other currency terms they could break out now in nominal but not real terms.
387 2018-04-07 04:37:50 Statutory rationing in a number of essential commodities was introduced in large cities; rationing is being managed by the public distribution system (PDS).
388 2018-04-07 04:36:52 Wow I agree exactly. So equities go higher yes, but do you think they go up on a real basis? I would think gold, silver, commodities, real estate and natural resource stocks perform the best because they're small markets with best margin of safety.
389 2018-04-07 04:36:42 and fall. Prices of production inputs are flexible downward and upward. but comparatively speaking,wages are only flexible upward. The rate at which wages grow  affects how commodities are priced,if not kept in check,in the long run commodities could get more expensive.

391 2018-04-07 04:26:35 BottomLine is he has no understanding of the "trade war,tariffs,market exchange on commodities, debt ratio of cost of import nor export for goods simple as that" you can fake the Worlds economically is not a Reality Show
392 2018-04-07 04:26:29 If commodities collapse, equities will be ahead in risk-off environment! It’s not a great news for investors as they need to content with low reward fixed income! This is not good for the economy when @RBI has turned bullish on growth - inflation dynamics!
393 2018-04-07 04:25:31 ,workers get wage increases almost on a yearly basis. 
Labor costs usually are a largest component of  firms' total production costs.,
particularly manufacturing firms. Demand and supply, draught and adequate rain are among the factors that affect prices of commodities to rise
394 2018-04-07 04:23:21 Children are now commodities I guess.
395 2018-04-07 04:22:38 A very good start for the 2019 financial year - Cash ROE this first week of Apr-18 from FX and commodities already contributed as much as 55.35% of last month (Mar-18)!

403 2018-04-07 03:40:30 "While Trump may not fear a trade war, farmers and ranchers across the U.S. heartland are increasingly nervous that a prolonged trade dispute with Beijing would hurt their exports at a time when they are suffering through a long-term slump in commodities prices"
404 2018-04-07 03:33:09 The problem is not only with RBI but all regulators who rather than finding black sheeps ban everything in one go. This has happened many times in our mkts - commodities, FX and equites. That's why we have liquid NIFTY and INR mkt outside of India as well. @SEBI_India
405 2018-04-07 03:24:50 Really though, the term’s aren’t useful here, as short and long trading positions relate to contracts for supply of commodities and under AEMO for obvious reasons all the contracts are short.
406 2018-04-07 03:15:40 @DZMMTeleRadyo @alvinelchico Your guest from DTI is making a fool of Filipinos by saying that the skyrocketing of prices is not due to the TRAIN Law when, in fact, ALL prices of basic commodities, services & utilities went up as a result of the excise tax on fuel. #cogenitalliar
407 2018-04-07 03:14:37 The tax bill gave most of the 1.5 trillion dollars to corporations and top 1 percent! creating financial disparity, middle class, tariffs will prices on many commodities, and our deficit will cause reflex cuts to SS and Medicare! Trump is intentionally ruining economy!
408 2018-04-07 03:08:11 Amigo, aqui ninguém é desinformado. Boom de commodities. Enquanto isto, serviços cresciam e empregavam inúmeras pessoas sem grande qualificação. E a indústria definhava, inversamente ao incremen da dívida pública. O final você sabe. Todos sabemos.

413 2018-04-07 02:41:01 There are very few actual "brave" people in this world.  Craig Murray knows the risks of speaking out and yet for the right reasons he continues to do so.  He uses common sense, respect and truth.  Those are commodities that are in very short supply nowadays.
414 2018-04-07 02:40:46 So because US citizens don't want to see price increases on commodities made with the help of CRIMINAL illegal immigrants, we should ignore that they are breaking the law? Sorry, I don't think the ends justify the means here.

419 2018-04-07 02:06:14 Já virei e revirei do avesso uma qtde grande de material sobre o oil. Nunca fiz isso sobre o potássio. Não saberia opinar. O mínimo q eu sei é q fertilizantes acompanham aproximadamente oil/soft commodities. Mas isso é de orelhada, muito raso.
420 2018-04-07 02:06:09 China consumes close to 1/2 the world's soybeans (as with many commodities) but produces just 5-10 percent.  US and Brazil each supply about 1/3 of global demand, Argentina a distant 3rd place. So, no.
421 2018-04-07 02:05:44 There are four types of bulk commodities that China exports to the United States: textile raw materials and accessories, apparel products and accessories, footwear furniture and bags, and automatic data processing equipment and components; totaling approximately US$3.2 trillion.
422 2018-04-07 02:04:58 As long as the United States has stuck to these four types of commodities, not only has it solved the trade deficit, it has also caused China’s unemployment rate to rise – which has led to the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts to maintain stability.
423 2018-04-07 01:50:34 As Interest Rates Continue To Rise—Bond Prices & Commodities ( Gold, Oil, Corn Etc..) Will Decline, as Bond Yields, The Dollar & Stocks Continue Higher. Near Interest Rates of 5% & Higher—Only the Best Earnings, will Keep Stocks Moving Higher.

430 2018-04-07 01:29:18 I want it banned because there this is no way to ensure the welfare of these beautiful dogs. How can we expect industry participants to put the dogs' welfare first when they deny any wrongdoing? Greyhounds are not commodities, they are gentle dogs who deserve better.
431 2018-04-07 01:26:15 Holy $_&t!!! You are actually bragging that your policies are SO BAD that they are bringing down the ENTIRE GLOBAL COMMODITIES MARKET!!!!! You are worse then I thought you were 
432 2018-04-07 01:20:41 And what do you say to people who already losing jobs due to Trump's tweets? Prices of commodities have already responded to the tariff proposals. Steel and aluminum up enough to cause layoffs in manufacturing that use these products.

435 2018-04-07 01:10:54 Would argue the above with 3 points

- bond vol is meaningless because it is directly suppressed by CB balance sheet expansion 
- commodities are both diverse and their individual return characteristics are inherently unpredictable

451 2018-04-07 00:06:06 It makes no sense to impose tariffs when we depend on imported commodities.

456 2018-04-06 23:35:02 Mr. Trump before you can start imposing these stiff tariffs you need to set in place our metal industry in full swing to those commodities your going to set stiff tariffs on to China. It could set a domino effect of fall to our financial economy.

470 2018-04-06 23:48:41 We'll be watching our food prices go up while watching farm commodities rotting in the fields and storage facilities. Plus the Dow will keep dropping. Trump knows squat about economics or trade.
471 2018-04-06 23:46:28 No sacaron a nadie de la pobreza. Reparten dinero ajeno hasta que el dinero se acaba. Y los pobres vuelven a ser pobres. Son unos comisionistas de la repartija del boom de commodities. Si robó que vaya preso y punto.!!

473 2018-04-06 23:39:30 The average American may get a small tax break however prices for a lot of commodities will rise with the Tariffs, also the 1.5 trillion dollar raise he gave to corporations will go to share holders and stock dividends, and will   money for SS and Medicare and infrastructure!
474 2018-04-06 23:35:02 Mr. Trump before you can start imposing these stiff tariffs you need to set in place our metal industry in full swing to those commodities your going to set stiff tariffs on to China. It could set a domino effect of fall to our financial economy.

481 2018-04-06 23:15:23 It’s how they separate the speculation market from the “physical” market. In other words, it gives the banks and trading houses control over commodities prices while letting them profit and hold up the financial system which is their lifeblood. It’s a scam! #downwiththefed

489 2018-04-06 22:52:34 Switzerland has a free trade agreement with China. I never heard trump call for a FTA with China. Australia exports a lot of commodities to China.

499 2018-04-06 22:11:23 China is aggressively moving toward their goal of being the world's leading economic & military power. Thank you for taking them on; unfortunately for agriculture & commodities/futures, they are now being hurt by the Chinese tariffs. Can't the WTO change China's status?
500 2018-04-06 22:03:15 It’s the 6th today. The valuation delta is pretty extreme. These companies are commodities being valued like IP companies. If I was long CXO and short SM, HK, OAS I’ll slam my and other longs, to cover shorts. Like Viking did with PE.

505 2018-04-06 21:32:58 The private sector, unregulated, has immense influence, in this case "Prices of food commodities".

Mind you, the private sector takes "All" the risks, goes to the rural areas, pays for transportation from farmer to consumer without any form of assistance from the government
506 2018-04-06 21:29:42 stocks crashing is bad for everything because everything is more and more correlated to the stock market every year. Also, most commodities are correlated to the stock market. Commodities are: energies (correlated), ag (correlated), base and industrial metals (correlated), 1/2
507 2018-04-06 21:25:39 The improvements already started under FHC..  Lula did not put the windfall profits from commodities into Brazil's future. Rather PT put them into their own pockets.

513 2018-04-06 21:12:06 @SenJohnMcCain has been misinformed, farm produce are commodities with a global demand, the only way for china to hurt the farmbelt is to ban crops from all countries. If they buy soybeans from Brazil, Brazil's customers buy them from us. The price stays the same.
514 2018-04-06 21:10:26 Excelente artículo. También se debería ver la opción de implementar mercados de futuros y opciones sobre commodities como el arroz o el banano. Con eso los agricultores aseguran un precio para la época de cosecha y eliminan el riesgo.
515 2018-04-06 21:05:39 Why don't you recognize the inherent douchyness of the ask?  It's quite literally asking a woman to trade her body for something. Only someone who thinks of women as commodities instead of actual human beings  would ask that.

518 2018-04-06 21:03:53 Indeed. Very simple. Stymied economic growth, lowered business investment, lower employment, lower consumer confidence, brings down equities, commodities, and real estate. Perpetual decline. What’s not to love? But what do I know—I only hold an advanced degree in economics.

527 2018-04-06 20:24:55 Since China is the world’s largest trading economy and the largest buyer of commodities like oil products, China could use its influence to push its own currency, RMB, in global markets to reduce the dominance of the US dollar. That would be a heavy blow to Washington ZH

557 2018-04-06 18:43:49 Economic damage done by the "trade wars" is not due to the actual tariffs, it will be due to the uncertainty associated with long-term contracts.

591 2018-04-06 16:52:47 El milagro da los altos precios de los commodities. Así cualquiera.
592 2018-04-06 16:44:01 I don't understand the logic of comparing cost... If actually we need to see the development... We should have a look at multiple factors like income, happiness index, consumer satisfaction, etc.... By just comparing prices of few commodities is not decisive!
593 2018-04-06 16:42:43 It’s not. I have studied economics at an undergraduate and at a tertiary education level. 

I don’t need lectures from some idiot who read three Ron Paul books and thinks they know Econ. 

I fundamentally disagree w/ the notion elephants are commodities.
594 2018-04-06 16:42:18 I agree with this and it is completely necessary, but why don't these corporations hold themselves to higher standards toward the communities in which they operate? Where is their integrity? They want to be considered "people" but treat actual people as commodities.

597 2018-04-06 16:29:06 There are four types of bulk commodities that China exports to the United States: textile raw materials and accessories, apparel products and accessories, footwear furniture and bags, and automatic data processing equipment and components; totaling approximately US$3.2 trillion.
598 2018-04-06 16:28:36 As long as the United States has stuck to these four types of commodities, not only has it solved the trade deficit, it has also caused China’s unemployment rate to rise – which has led to the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts to maintain stability.
599 2018-04-06 16:27:16 So you are suggesting we begin farming elephants and lions, and selling them as if they are cows and pigs. 

In other words, they’re commodities instead of living creatures. 

That is unutterably stupid.

Mas não mais do que o que de países com governo centrista como Chile e Peru e outros países sul-americanos que também se aproveitaram do boom dos preços das commodities".

621 2018-04-06 15:33:55 Securities fraud, also known as stock fraud and investment fraud, is a deceptive practice in the stock or commodities markets that induces investors to make purchase or sale decisions on the basis of false information, frequently resulting in losses, in violation of securitieslaw

638 2018-04-06 14:54:10 Look at the commodity charts.. but seems I have to teach you using Google properly...   Oil peaked in 2014...  other commodities (Gold, Iron, Copper) even before that..  Dilma continued like nothing happened and interefered with CB that needed to tigthen too much in 2015..
639 2018-04-06 14:52:16 North America produces a tremendous amount of food for export, among a number of other commodities China can not produce on their own. Our excess production VS. the number of mouths to feed in China, presents a huge advantage at the table.

658 2018-04-06 13:36:33 Does George Soros follow a practice of ‘buying’ whatever it is he wants?  I’m asking:  does he think it’s his right to pay money for not only commodities, but people, places, concepts, and beliefs, as well?  If so, does this tell us anything about Governor Kate Brown?
659 2018-04-06 13:27:31 Yeah, the whole deflation v inflation battle has been so finely poised, it could flip either way I agree.

That’s why I’d rather call on historical analogies in ‘11 and ‘14. Both times expections were far, har higher (look at commodities)
660 2018-04-06 13:21:21 Int'l oil prices fell more sharply in recent days, after the first wave of US trade tariffs against China was announced. Prices have been more stable today (US$67-68/b), implying that (a) shock value is starting to recede, and (b) full trade war is unlikely, despite the rhetoric.
661 2018-04-06 13:19:01 He hasn’t cost them a damn penny, China nor the US has imposed any tariffs. If you knew your commodities, soybeans, you’d know that there is not a surplus in the world. China buys elsewhere, someone else has to buy from us. Many Midwest farmers are socialists themselves.
662 2018-04-06 13:14:30 Also, not sure progressive/new/etc ETFs best for young investors. Begin w/ broad base funds until strong core built. Then can look at niche markets. Also, niche tend to be found in broad funds anyway (eg, commodities, cyber) or quickly enter wider markets (eg FB).
663 2018-04-06 13:14:09 The Chinese & the rest of the world have caught on to Trump's charade.  If he starts a TRADE WAR, they will attack his base with precision.  Place tariffs on coal, fossil fuels, American-made autos, agricultural commodities, aircraft, auto parts, passenger cars, pharmaceuticals.
664 2018-04-06 13:13:29 Like any other animal, give them individual attention and they are as affectionate & different in personality as  dogs & cats. It’s convenient to see them as ‘commodities’ who don’t suffer the same fear & pain as Fido the dog at home, or humans forced into similar conditions
665 2018-04-06 13:00:41 The opportunity cost of decongesiting Male City without any form of decentralization involved.

This is kind of an indirect tax we have to pay to decongest, which will work only for a year or two.

691 2018-04-06 12:01:21 Aluminum prices,  like all commodities,  fluctuate based on demand. If the price of aluminum is down, it's because the demand for aluminum is down.  In other words, industry has slowed and their need for raw materials has dropped.

695 2018-04-06 11:47:10 You do know how commodities prices work don't you? Stock market drops, commodities follow.
696 2018-04-06 11:45:15 I'm with you on austerity being a con and a way of getting to the public sector and the poor! We can just make money though. It has to be balanced against assets/debts (fiat) or commodities (gold etc). The higher tax, Scandinavian system works, albeit with a smaller population.
697 2018-04-06 11:39:35 The tariffs aren't even in effect yet, you fucking moron. Again, you confuse the stock and commodities markets with real life. #ImpeachTrump
698 2018-04-06 11:39:07 Commonsense: @POTUS wants to close gap on $800B / yr trade deficit in GOODS, & $500B /yr in SERVICES, he MUST use import tariffs. KEY IS our import tariffs will target: a) 24/7 factories; & b) goods/commodities whereas to enable US merchants to sell more goods to US consumers

703 2018-04-06 11:30:04 The market-language and reasoning applied to race in higher education turns it and well as POC faculty, into commodities. We become an item claimed on some kind of "diversity" inventory and racism becomes an item on a to-do list, usually somewhere near the bottom.

When seeking capital to setup a business, don’t you guys factor in operational costs? Will revenue start immediately you begin? Is your market readily available? No marketing?

711 2018-04-06 10:43:43 Robert, the latter point is crucial, 'what you know'. We all have sectors that are  our specialities. For myself, since the 80's, that is commodities and selective manufacturing. You understand the core of media and entertainment tremendously and I appreciate your expertise.

787 2018-04-06 03:48:46 Today’s capitalist economy is still founded on the structure of European mercantilist empire in which the relations of feudalism were not ended for everyone but internalised in a new system of class oppression based on race, in which non whites were in vassalage, made commodities
788 2018-04-06 03:45:29 It didn't have wage labor. I mean you got paid a salary, but wage labor in the capitalist sense means labor is a commodity. Commodities are traded on a market, in the USSR labor was controlled by a central plan. This means that wages were based on contribution, not market value.

800 2018-04-06 02:35:25 Thinking of the way we have been sold. Equifax took our SocialSecurity IDs, & Facebook sold each of us to Russia.  Ordinary people have become commodities of the data hungry

802 2018-04-06 02:14:02 The good news for #Silver is that it's  acting like a currency not a commodity. As markets get pounded, #Copper and #CrudeOil do also, but silver has been following #Gold and acting as a hedge. Good news to those stacking. #HODL #Metals #commodities

805 2018-04-06 01:28:27 Hi Peter what trading platform would you recommend for trading commodities?
806 2018-04-06 01:22:26 Twitter is really not the best medium for it. But, in short, the production of commodities for exchange rather than for use, and the requirement for capital to purchase labor power to extract surplus value from it are inherent features of capitalism and inevitably exploitative.
807 2018-04-06 01:18:00 Eh...it's not completely a stretch right now:
1) Trump uses women as commodities. 
2) Putin collects kompromat, often using sex stuff as blackmail
3) treat women like trash; you can accidentally toss a linchpin.
4) the fact she is in jail could be part of a ploy to silence her
808 2018-04-06 01:12:08 Just cut off the foodstuffs and cotton and they will come around real quick. They have no place to replace those commodities.

811 2018-04-06 01:10:33 Crypto currency is one in 4 categories: crypto tokens (like a tokenized security), crypto collectibles and crypto commodities (utility tokens) being the others. Banks are indeed fine and the fact that they adopt blockchain for faster and cheaper transactions is great.
812 2018-04-06 01:07:37 In actuality no, but how about telling the truth how the African slave trade started. O, educatorsdon't want to tell that African tribes conquered other tribes and enslaved them then sold them for commodities....
813 2018-04-06 01:03:48 tenemos que pararle el carro a los que dicen que lula saco a nosecuantosmillones de personas de la pobreza cuando fueron los precios de las commodities
814 2018-04-06 00:59:19 #commodities declining, #China slowing, #Australia housing and banking ugly, risk sentiment weak, RBA holding historical low rate but $AUDUSD keeps bid lol
815 2018-04-06 00:53:12 Fuí proveedor (muy menor) de CNH. Lo que recibió de orden económico de Fernando Henrique Cardoso lo mantuvo gracias a los precios de los commodities. Imagino que  eso te dijeron en CNH, pero, fué un festival de corrupción que terminó mal, muy parecido a los Ks.

818 2018-04-06 00:35:57 O que te faz pensar que igualdade é algo bom?
Ele só fez populismo e surfou na onda das exportações de commodities. Nada disso invalida os crimes desse patife.
819 2018-04-06 00:24:53 então foi você o autor do furto de meus commodities?
820 2018-04-06 00:14:30 Yes, the previous conservative govt killed the manufacturing sector because they hated unions. They turned Canada into a 3rd world economy dependent on exporting RAW commodities.  Encouraged energy and drilling but didn't build a single meter of new pipeline to transport it. #CPC
821 2018-04-06 00:12:28 Everything is the scourge of China's crackdown on "soybeans."
China’s election has imposed a “precision strike” on the top three commodities (soybeans, automobiles, and aircraft) of the Republican Party’s mid-term elections.
822 2018-04-06 00:05:22 Not good for equities markets. Can be good for commodities.
