4 2018-05-24 23:55:07 Also Trump thinks stock market is the economy. Kind of bizarre way to look at the economy. Stocks in US industries affected by Korean peninsula lost a lot of value bc possible peace. So he's also thinking of war industry, I'm sure.

38 2018-05-24 23:38:25 I do not t believe for one sec this bullshit about Netflix. This is all staged propaganda and another example of the rich controlling the market. sign a deal with Dems then manipulate stocks so the commoner believes the country loves Obama LIES LIES LIES Continue the boycott
39 2018-05-24 23:38:08 Depends, I have held certain stocks for several years, but ultimately sold some or all, which have some been some of my best trades.

50 2018-05-24 23:30:06 Trump and the GOP told us their tax bill would help companies like Harley-Davidson hire more workers. So what’d the company do once it became law? Bought back $700M in stocks, fired 800 workers, & opened a plant...in Thailand. This is the #GOPTaxScam at work.

Wendls book "The NCAV approach to stock investing" has a pie chart. 72% of NCAV stocks have risen, 28% have declined a year later (1949-2009 data). Not sure about the magnitude to plug in.

Whenever President Twittler (@POTUS ) does ANYTHING, including something as absolutely fucking stupid as cancelling the NK summit, the stocks plummet! Just this morning at breakfast, it was down 200 points..

137 2018-05-24 22:14:25 No, but we aren’t limiting common sense gun laws to school shootings. Bump stocks and AR-15’s were purchased legally and killed many in the Las Vegas shooting. Multiple shot guns are designed for one thing, shooting a lot of people at once. Why does an individual want one?

158 2018-05-24 21:58:18 The “wealth” of Boomers is built on a mountain of debt (price-inflated assets with an exchange value far beyond their use value).  As they retire and are forced to luquidate these assets, Millennials will begin to buy stocks.  But the math doesn’t work yet.

163 2018-05-24 21:51:53 and in the meantime, quick wins through maybe democratising stock ownership. Cheaper, more seamless access to the market allowing workers to also be shareholders. Wages go down, they gain from uptick in stocks. Robinhood, Acorns and a lot of edcation/awareness.

#UpTheMeggies 
265 2018-05-24 20:51:04 Overall it was a fairly low-energy day for the #Bombers with too many non-participants to count.  Neither Streveler nor Ross did anything to boost their stocks (although I still think Streveler is slightly ahead in comp.). CB Marcus Sayles continues to impress. #Bombers #CFL
266 2018-05-24 20:46:33 I could also use the endless stocks of idws and 1911s i have as grunt
267 2018-05-24 20:46:17 #science tells us that there are three major types of climate change: anthropogenic, solocentric and arthropomorphic.  Climate change has both positive and negative effects, as do many things in Nature.  Higher CO2 levels necessarily promote vegetation growth (feed stocks).
268 2018-05-24 20:45:50 My #infrastructureweek initiatives are working good  (great). Many people tell me they are spending less time in traffic with all the new roads, bridges, and trains.  And the JOBS are boosting the economy. (Look at stocks.) Only downside is price of gas. Will fix NEXT!
269 2018-05-24 20:44:16 That’s because most of the senators have stocks in arms industry. Make laws that ensure all office bearers have to divest their assets in blind trusts and you will see a change.
270 2018-05-24 20:44:12 Also, very few vocal people in the gun reform debate are calling for repeal of the 2A. Rather, people want regs like red-flag laws, universal background checks, licensing and training in all states, limits to high-capacity magazines, banning bump stocks, etc.
271 2018-05-24 20:41:46 I see these crazy P&Ls, how many traders trade on margin??? #stocks #investing #traders #NYSE #Nasdaq #dowjones
272 2018-05-24 20:41:29 Rev. Synaptcalypse produced a beautiful purple hardcover edition of the PD. If Amazon stocks that version, it seems like that's the highest-quality.
273 2018-05-24 20:41:18 Positive day. Had some losses early on trading $tsla… complete irrational moves, but ended on the + side trading other stocks.
274 2018-05-24 20:40:51 The top five stocks that fell today were $BBY, $WHR, $ALB, $HRL, and $ABBV.
275 2018-05-24 20:40:20 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
276 2018-05-24 20:40:19 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $BAC, $MU, $AMD, and $HPE.
277 2018-05-24 20:39:59 @DSmithShow I bought NFLX stock last year @ $189/share. It’s now $349/share. I bought DIS last year @ $104 it’s now $102. Hoping Star Wars & sports gambling should help DIS stocks.
278 2018-05-24 20:39:49 The top five stocks that gained today were $NRG, $KSI, $LB. $FL, and $AEE.

282 2018-05-24 20:37:52 Hey, Bree! Do you also support raising the age to purchase guns to 21 and banning military-style semi-automatic assault rifles, bump stocks, and magazine capacities above 10 rounds? Not trying to trick you. I ask as a major gun-control advocate who lost a friend at UCC.
283 2018-05-24 20:37:04 Where auto stocks ended today after Trump threatened tariffs on imports:

288 2018-05-24 20:33:55 Jeannie. I asked a friend who markets IFlix over in Europe and he said there really isn’t any competitors here, that’s the prob. We need to start investing in conservative propaganda studios and tech companies - that’s the answer. Buy THEIR stocks
289 2018-05-24 20:33:37 Si se quedara en una bajada del 5% no pasaría nada , el problema es que terminaría en 52-53 y lleva cayendo toda la semana desde los 60$.
290 2018-05-24 20:33:17 Once upon a time, this was an easy call for Billy. But their stocks have been moving in the opposite direction for a few years. Carol might have it now
291 2018-05-24 20:32:03 El guideance también es mejor de lo que esperan los analistas , pero para el próximo trimestre esperan EPS de -0,20 y el mercado esperaba -0,13. El EPS actual y futuro es lo que decepciona . El resto supera

299 2018-05-24 20:25:32 That is conventional Wall Street thinking but actually it isn’t true at all that stocks showing relative strength on dips will rally hard once it ends. Back test it and you’ll see...
300 2018-05-24 20:25:20 Empezó bajando un 10% en el after , ha llegado a caer un 3%, ahora un 5%. Habrá que esperar a la conferencia con analistas que empieza en 5 minutos a ver si se da la vuelta . A ver que tal lo hace mañana y si se da la vuelta .

320 2018-05-24 20:08:49 Well, despite the catastrophic news that Warhammer Adventures are going to gut the warhammer lore and destroy everything that 30 years of development has stood for, my GW stocks are exponentially increasing in value by the day :^)
321 2018-05-24 20:08:48 U.S. stocks close lower, energy the day's biggest decliner
322 2018-05-24 20:07:59 World stocks lower: US -.2%; Europe -.5%. Korea summit collapse, renewed trade worries & rising political uncertainty preordained market weakness. Headline risk too high for short-term traders without illegal inside info on Trumps moves.
323 2018-05-24 20:07:55 Stocks close mostly lower after Trump cancels summit with North Korea's Dear Leader. "It might have been the best comedy TV of the year," lamented one trader.

Dow -75, -0.3% to 24,811

331 2018-05-24 20:04:31 I got out of most of my oil stocks last week. So far,  looks like a good decision. Looking to get back in on a couple of them after some settling out.

359 2018-05-24 19:45:54 I think we need to turn the stock market into loot crate. Every month, investors get a bundle of curated, themed stock certificates. That's the only way to buy stocks because they're all "exclusive".
360 2018-05-24 19:44:34 @CNBCClosingBell Is there any oversight on that pension? Borrowing at 4.5% to invest into stocks is risky and idiotic.
361 2018-05-24 19:43:43 Yes, should be able to own but the owner must register it and is responsible for any harm caused by the weapon. Restrict high cap mags. No more bump stocks.

403 2018-05-24 19:13:04 $MDXG  "how would you know that?" Most people in college are looking forward to a future that is long the marketplace. Short sellers do not promote employment or innovation in the marketplace. They seek to drive markets, stocks, and innovation to zero for a short time only.
404 2018-05-24 19:12:24 Which of your rights is on the line? Would expanding background checks, enacting a waiting period, red flag laws (through the courts), or banning bump stocks impact your rights? The 2nd isn't a free for all.

429 2018-05-24 19:00:34 Typically the market is good before it crashes...cutting taxes decreases the revenue of the Fed budget. Interest rates rise. Money moves from stocks to bonds. It happens every time. You either do not understand markets or you do not care. Both are despicable.

490 2018-05-24 18:22:02 often oil isn't a mitigating factor when considering household wealth, but rather the main driver of wealth inequality. Norway created a SWF and have broad public ownership of stocks. they could've made different decisions.

641 2018-05-24 16:56:21 Please do keep ignoring facts about stocks that don’t actually have anything to do with most people’s economical lives.  Including yours, I’m sure.
642 2018-05-24 16:56:04 There are months when a few stocks remain in your portfolio peacefully over months but a few may give you daily stress.

654 2018-05-24 16:49:59 I wonder if it was worth for their business passing along to brazilian consumers the hike on oil prices plus 13% less on stocks value instead of doing it smoothly and slowly...
655 2018-05-24 16:49:32 I can’t wait to get home from work and do my research on stocks!!
656 2018-05-24 16:48:45 Go Short....!! Oh wait stocks already corrected from 980 to 920... ur write @BrainandMoney !! Insiders every where .. so now we also know why ONGC and OIL india tanked
657 2018-05-24 16:47:38 I may be "mix orange juice with vanilla ice cream to make an orange creamsicle" dull, but at least I'm not "Buy stocks in Tesla to cheer up Elon Musk after getting Twitter dunked on"  dull
658 2018-05-24 16:47:12 IF YOU WANT TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE THEN BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS AND BUMP STOCKS AND ENACT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECK LAWS AND ALSO RAISE THE AGE TO BUY ANY GUNS!!
659 2018-05-24 16:46:53 Do you do UK update and re stocks?
660 2018-05-24 16:46:36 Lol yes... bit of a tangent but until I read Warran Buffet's biography I never knew stocks used to be, like, physical pieces of paper lol
661 2018-05-24 16:46:15 @jeneps Not an overreaction in the markets - just yet. Stocks fell , gold spiked and bitcoin bounced of LOD. Not overdone....yet.

666 2018-05-24 16:44:16 President Trump draws away from the campaign meeting with Kim, then all the sudden defense stocks go up. This should give you a clue that this is not about the welfare of people but about money. 
For the Love of Money is the root of all evil
667 2018-05-24 16:44:12 No, he is beating us all, we won’t vote, we bicker amongst ourselves - all the while he stocks the court with his flunkies, purges the FBI and Justice Department. After they win the midterms the arrests will start.
668 2018-05-24 16:43:51 That's fair. I was more thinking of physical labour-ish gigs. Even being the guy who stocks the shelves for 8 hours would be tougher than listening to music at a desk banging out code.
669 2018-05-24 16:43:48 I only know this because my husband is directly involved in that particular field since before the internet when BBS was how info moved on stocks.  Someone like Michael @MichaelAvenatti might be able to weigh in or pursue.
670 2018-05-24 16:43:31 I once actually asked ok if you don't have money give me stocks in the startup you want to work for free in lieu of the work you want me to do. Never heard back... funny thing the CEO was very well paid in the same startup with no budget :P

674 2018-05-24 16:42:39 Thats true hiwever broadly this is also a phase of mid & small cap correction which has affected many stocks including some quality ones
675 2018-05-24 16:42:38 Hi! We replenished most of our stocks again. Best to check again. Thank you! 
676 2018-05-24 16:42:10 Salisbury is @GOP atm, though no recent polling

@TheDemocrats want you to have less gun rights than you do
there is no legislation banning guns being entertained
there is legislation against Assault Rifles, magazine capacity, bump stocks, background checks & age limits
677 2018-05-24 16:41:50 I don’t like Bump Stocks, but they are a non-issue.  In all honesty as are all of the “liberal” bans on weapons or components.  Those that desire to kill (which is illegal) won’t comply with bans.  A motivated individual can improvise a weapon to kill mass groups within hours.
678 2018-05-24 16:41:47 "SAVE innocent lives!"?? Look in the mirror, liar!

YOU turned your back on the victims of mass shootings, and caved to the NRA!

Quit making empty promises. You didn't even ban bump stocks after all that big talk. NO ACTION!

Make Schools Safe Again!

684 2018-05-24 16:39:46 Economic flows (transactions stated in money units) occur over a stated period of time, e.g., quarterly. Stocks are stated in money units as of a particular date such as the beginning and end of the respective quarter. Stocks balance due to accounting definitions and customs.
685 2018-05-24 16:39:21 Depending upon their longer stay in the porftfolio stocks get aged and  tagged as per the three paramaters of Long Term Scalibility, Price Realization and Stable Growth Compounders.

689 2018-05-24 16:37:54 Stock options in any company, including $TSLA, are a really inefficient way to motivate employees. Most company stocks have 50%+ of price movement related to macro factors out of anyone's control. Better to focus on specific KPIs that the employee can control and do cash bonus!
690 2018-05-24 16:37:23 Why? You don’t but stocks?
691 2018-05-24 16:37:13 Abhishek, looking at the latest pick - Kaveri Seeds, have a feeling that Indian stocks are being bought on the basis of long term charts and not on the basis of fundamentals/valuations. Charts could explain Kaveri, KRBL, Sunteck, Kolte Patil.  Valuations may not.
692 2018-05-24 16:36:25 @WBrettWilson Is your book similar to Ray Dalio book Principles?  I thought it was amazing to see what he did to have so much success. I invest in stocks and read a lot of books on investing and changing mindsets. You were awesome on Dragon Den by the way :)
693 2018-05-24 16:35:38 Would have to be a ‘while stocks last’ clause though.
694 2018-05-24 16:35:23 I don't currently have a position. But it is one of the stocks I would buy back into aggressively if I became rich overnight. I'm not pleased with the delays and inconsistent transparency either. I think 25 cents is a fair price to hold at.
695 2018-05-24 16:34:59 Another successful day of stocks  easy money.
696 2018-05-24 16:34:54 $HIHI Loading wall people, seriously?  You can buy millions of shares but you dont want to pay 1 tick more for it?   Umm ok.  I am not a Bid Sitter when stocks are moving.  Rarely a bid sitter ever, really
697 2018-05-24 16:32:45 You'd think they'd want to stop making laughing stocks of themselves at some point...
698 2018-05-24 16:32:42 Remember..there are no great stocks; they are all bad...unless they go up in price.
699 2018-05-24 16:32:40 @jposhaughnessy write something on factors to decide buying the same stocks when they do well or fare poorly
700 2018-05-24 16:32:13 #NFI-T nothing to be too worried about from a valuation point of view.  increased #dividend by 15%. Great at making small acquisitions.  #stocks #investing
701 2018-05-24 16:31:57 Everytime #Trump tweets or opens his mouth there's a ripple affect- stocks tumbles, fuel prices go up etc etc For the love of god impeach the vile man that he is 
702 2018-05-24 16:29:53 It really doesn't matter. The stocks he owns are just sitting there. What would you do if you had them and the capability to grow them? Who deserves to own them more, and who deserves to own all of your stuff? And what percentage of your property have you given away today?
703 2018-05-24 16:28:47 Como veis $SEDG?? A mi me a saltado el stoploss
704 2018-05-24 16:28:20 Nothing to do with rising margins, profits, fewer stocks in which to invest, buybacks producing cash needing a home.
705 2018-05-24 16:26:46 Where and when can we see today trade stocks.
706 2018-05-24 16:26:44 Chopped a host of stocks today and IQE was a faller at the first
707 2018-05-24 16:26:33 I, for one, am glad. I own a ton of bank stocks and could care less if all the poor morons that voted for Trump get screwed while making me rich.

Jk. But not really
708 2018-05-24 16:24:25 I'm not focused on stock of the day ex $GE but rather which stocks I expect will likely be there next, while still under the radar. ex $SPOT
709 2018-05-24 16:22:56 2/2 let's talk about ways to stop a shooter.
1. Another shooter
(here's where it gets hypothetical)
2. Tear gas.
3. Tasers  for teachers. 
4. Drones with tranquilizers. 

There must be many more. Yes let's ban bump stocks and have background checks, but let's do something too.
710 2018-05-24 16:22:12 What I love about market down days, especially on days when the market dips a decent amount(like today) is looking for stocks that are showing "relative strength".... 
These are the stocks that'll rally hard once the market regains strength
711 2018-05-24 16:22:06 :( Majority of the money was made in stocks identifying moats and holding for the long term no? (Ignoring funds dealing with currencies, commodities and speculation profits)
712 2018-05-24 16:20:52 You won’t get it lmao.. People ask for others work and go to the person who didn’t make it. They don’t get that we don’t have access to the pngs, stocks, lighting and textures they used
713 2018-05-24 16:20:48 I have to say nothing disgusts me more about this crazy biz than when stocks rally on increased war possibilities..happens too often for that to be coincidental. Cold hard reality i guess.
714 2018-05-24 16:20:21 Depends on stocks.
715 2018-05-24 16:20:17 Don't just focus on "stocks-of-the-month" focus on solid long-term investments
716 2018-05-24 16:20:12 He also does not accept stocks as payment. The stocks he owns are just sitting there. If he sells them off, they'd probably be worth even less. He definitely wouldn't get 20 billion for them. They certainly don't impact what kind of home he can afford, unless he sells them.
717 2018-05-24 16:19:17 Don't play the penny stocks.
718 2018-05-24 16:17:06 Down another 0.7% myself and I’ve cleared the decks with a few stocks. Time for a new impetus.
719 2018-05-24 16:15:49 STOP KDKDKSK i have too many requests to my supplier right now and she's busy lately so please >< i'll try my best to open one, depends on budget, stocks, and schedule!
720 2018-05-24 16:15:39 How many years do we have? I need a call or text when it’s time to get out of stocks!
721 2018-05-24 16:15:29 Great day in the stocks 
722 2018-05-24 16:15:20 Yeah, that's essentially what I do too... I follow the same core basket of stocks w/ a few added or removed occasionally. Then I try to wait patiently (easier said than done) for really good R/R opportunities. 

Honestly, 2-3 excellent trades and my entire month is done.
723 2018-05-24 16:14:58  since already lot of stocks available- ur queue no. 108739930
724 2018-05-24 16:14:51 Well said. I used to chase trades but now I've realised this and proving very effective. The reason as my understanding is 90% of the time stocks are in a Shake out mood.  Recent trade is of Infosys for me.

730 2018-05-24 16:13:37 Actually companies have not been buying back their stocks as much as dems have said they would, most are investing in growing across the country. Also he tariffs got China to the negotiating table, and because of that they are buying $300+ billion more US goods to end the deficit
731 2018-05-24 16:13:34 JUST read that Donald Trump has been buying & selling stocks throughout his Presidency as he makes policies...isn't that the ultimate INSIDER TRADING? Isn't that against the law? are you watching his trade? When can we expect to see him arrested? Hoping it's soon !
732 2018-05-24 16:13:26 CN urban class wage growth is the biggest global event of the decade IMO. 400M peoples wages $8k to $24k + large gains in RE & stocks. Like someone dropped a new EU.The growth of this new CN consumer favorite may overshadow all else. E10 is stupid with Corn. Okay with cane.

734 2018-05-24 16:12:25 @SEC_News I've just read that POTUS has been buying & selling stocks as he makes policies as POTUS....is that not the epitome of insider trading? is that not a crime? are you watching his EVERY move? Will you be charging him? Hope it happens SOON !
735 2018-05-24 16:12:05 Lmaooo they would look at me crazy if I talked about stocks lol hi I'm omar and I'm richer than everyone here because of stock trading the end! Lol

738 2018-05-24 16:11:54 I got first dibs on your stocks if you get new wheels 
739 2018-05-24 16:11:22 I am not surprised one bit that the NK Summit was cancelled. More surprised by the reaction in markets. 10-year was not surprised this is where it traded last night and that is why stocks were a BTD tradable opportunity this morning.
740 2018-05-24 16:11:19 LOL Lagos don't play our stocks and the % of people trading profitably can be much higher with proper planning, just like you lose when you break my rules, imagine how well you'd do if you would do the opposite of what you usually do :)
741 2018-05-24 16:08:46 But what about diversification? What if I don’t want to be 100% in crypto but have higher returns than stocks?
742 2018-05-24 16:08:35 U.S. stocks tumbled on Thursday after President Donald Trump canceled a planned historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, heightening concerns over his latest protectionist move as trade tensions with China simmer.
743 2018-05-24 16:08:01 @asjwebley just seen your message on LSE about #GWMO never stops to amaze me how bad PR is on big company's. 
Regular photos of work being done, meet the team interviews, updated maps of where work is undertaken, photo of drill samples... i could go on but....

Think no one knew about FreshRealm until mentioned by analyst this morning…thought all they do is 

Likely why there is a 27% Short interest

748 2018-05-24 16:07:00 That might be a bit ambitious long term, but I've been able to do it for a few months now successfully.  I basically have a handful of stocks that I enjoy following and try to make trade as few times as needed to hit 5%
749 2018-05-24 16:06:31 I feel like every set of results I've seen from SA consumer stocks going back about 10 yrs has the phrase "Despite tough trading conditions/challenging consumer environment..etc." but performed well..now shit is really hitting the fan, that line won't save you. Boy who cried wolf
750 2018-05-24 16:05:53 Doesn’t this region have the chunk of carry-over stocks? Bad for farmers but not a concern for policy makers.
751 2018-05-24 16:04:43 Large trades are professional small trades are retail and QQQ is not a market - its three or so mania stocks
752 2018-05-24 16:04:28 i planned to open a shinee giveaway but my supplier doesn't have any stocks for any shinee merch. she's a shinee anti. joke
753 2018-05-24 16:04:09 Bitches come around when your stocks up
754 2018-05-24 16:03:54 Coming to Stocks, as many as 166 securities including Apollo Hospitals, Ambuja Cements, BHEL, CEAT and Century Textiles & Industries hit 52-week lows on NSE despite market sentiment remained positive.

756 2018-05-24 16:03:03 US consumption & therefore 2/3 of US GDP is dependent on stocks...which makes rates dependent on stocks, on a lag.
757 2018-05-24 16:02:55 Remember, betting against stocks based off short-term news headlines is not only detrimental to your sanity, it is detrimental to your wallet as well. Call me crazy, I just don't think NK news is going to affect how many iPhones $AAPL pushes out or how many hamburgers $MCD sells.
758 2018-05-24 16:02:21 Maybe bc ur up in Connecticut lol. The Harrison’s were overrated coming out of HS all bc of their size. Dakari is an outdated kind of player and Briscoe is a point guard who couldn’t shoot. No coach would have improved their draft stocks, especially the latter two. No coach
759 2018-05-24 16:02:00 @MarketFoolery @TMFChrisHill TheChinaHustle rattled me. You discuss $TCEHY & $BABA often. What gives you peace of mind when investing in these Chinese stocks? Is there more transparency or accountability than before? Can we be sure we aren’t being “hustled” yet again?
760 2018-05-24 16:01:57 Y’all wouldn’t even believe me if I told y’all how much I made trading stocks 
761 2018-05-24 16:01:51 I love how I can see a blurb of good or bad political news and at this point check my stocks with a relatively accurate idea of how they've shifted

Now, just imagine, if you had a lot of money and knew the news before it's released to the public.....

798 2018-05-24 15:45:22 The Chinese and our government are both destroying our environment. If we dont stand up now, it will be too late.

799 2018-05-24 15:45:04 I get that. Until a crypto becomes universally acceptable as means of payment, and until the point-of-sale transaction costs can rival straight fiat cash, cryptos are just speculative assets. Prone to ponzi-like scams like penny stocks.

828 2018-05-24 15:35:07 Bump stocks are stupid and can be banned for all I care. AR-15s are often used to deal with vermin, like hogs. The AR-15 isn't normally used for hunting large game, because of the .223 round it uses, but the AR-10 uses the larger .308 round, which is ideal for hunting.

Please get back to actual finance
instead of going wall-to-wall with

It is not even news, since we all
knew it would happen this way.
Try #stocks #bonds #finance and

992 2018-05-24 14:34:19 Yardeni is an economic strategist. He is looking to identify whether broad market indices can continue to rise, not pick value stocks. I think it makes sense for him to focus on NTM earnings.

1009 2018-05-24 14:28:52 Banning bump stocks is the most idiotic bit of virtue signaling to come from the gun control lobby. They’re a novelty. The Vegas shooter would’ve killed more people if he’d just used semi auto and aimed properly. Banning bump stocks won’t save one life.
1010 2018-05-24 14:28:05 Though banning bump stocks shows progress the sad truth is its ultimately ineffective. A rubberband and a piece of metal accomplish the same modification. Lawmakers need to come across the aisle and look more closely at what Republicans have suggested.

Fors outranges Maypul and combos well for early stocks. He has good tools in neutral to bait out a response and punish it.

Ori invalidates Lily, has similarly high neutral speed, and Sein edgeguards are also hard for Maypul. I could see it being closer to even though.

1056 2018-05-24 14:16:09 @realDonaldTrump @larry_kudlow NOT GOOD FOR MID-TERM VOTES! Need the Market to be UP! Stocks Slide as Trump Calls Off North Korea Summit: Markets Wrap
1057 2018-05-24 14:15:52 So we are back to January 2018 where there was no talk on North Korea meeting but this time we have no trade war with China. If that is not bullish for stocks, then I don't know.
1058 2018-05-24 14:15:50 I need more friends who buy stocks I need advice and recommendations
1059 2018-05-24 14:15:22 If you don't love your money, buy these stocks.

1064 2018-05-24 14:13:48 Walls coming, don’t care who pays I’ll donate. World peace coming along faster and better then expected, bump stocks Obama never should’ve allowed. And neither should any leader. I blame them all for bump stocks. Independent thinker here.
1065 2018-05-24 14:12:56 @hustlerose86 Hey Gail, what does the second amendment mean to you? If it means that everyone gets bump stocks and automatic weapons, let’s all arm and get it on!  May the best woman win
1066 2018-05-24 14:12:46 A real dilemma here:
Should I sell stocks because the NK summit is off, or buy them because the 10yr yield is below 3.00%?
1067 2018-05-24 14:12:41 aren't you legally prohibited from publicly commenting on stocks?
1068 2018-05-24 14:12:00 To be fair, three Dem candidates make six figures, and one is over 300k. None make as much in stocks, however. Is this important? No idea. But again, the "glass house" argument made elsewhere is valid, and certainly not spurious.
1069 2018-05-24 14:11:55 Hey Pittsburgh, is there an independent bookstore that stocks genre romance books? 'Cause I'd love to buy local and not chain. (@littsburgh? Do you know?)

1077 2018-05-24 14:09:51 U.S. stocks dropped sharply on the North Korea news. The U.S. dollar also weakened broadly, particularly against the Japanese yen.
1078 2018-05-24 14:09:40 It feels like Trump is MANIPULATING the stock market.
My stocks had started recovering from a big loss and now it's  down. This pattern has repeated a few times.
1079 2018-05-24 14:09:16 This mornings news got me thinking two ways. One stocks are on sale and two this dumbass great “negotiator” we have might have just ruined the best opportunity to end the Korean War out of pettiness

1084 2018-05-24 14:07:55 Yes, but Obama made it worse. Look at the numbers man. Look up the stocks, unemployment rates, numbers, charts, dude you'll find out alot if you do research for yourself. Stop listening to the news. The only thing the news is good for is weather and even then that can be wrong.
1085 2018-05-24 14:07:45 Even in his cancellation letter he talks of ‘massive and powerful’ nuclear stocks. This is a man who thought he was worth a nobel peace prize

1098 2018-05-24 14:04:37 @MarkSKrikorian I heard Vicente Fox at the NPC say that trade balance wasn’t important for the U.S. It was the enormous profits of corporations and Wall Street that mattered, saying 60% of American are owners of stocks, not as if proportions of that matters.

We are very sorry that if we do not have fresh stock of this item in the stocks we will not be able to cater this product requirement.
1194 2018-05-24 13:39:08 @RobWittman Why do you believe "in the process of being banned" and "we banned bump stocks" mean the same thing? Is my wanting an honest Representative too much to ask?

1196 2018-05-24 13:35:26 Devastating to read this, especially if one believes that Bush, Cheney et al are war criminals, no different from those tried in Nuremberg. Never mind a day in the stocks; Bush and all of them should be in prison. Tony Blair too. It's an ongoing horror that no action hs bn taken.

Quid de l'Article 5.1 ?
"Les Parties devraient [...] conserver et [...] renforcer les puits et réservoirs de GES" 

Conserver les puits de GES (ex.  ) signifierait augmenter les stocks de C indéfiniment (-> limite physique)

Quelle interprétation alors?
1202 2018-05-24 13:31:31 WHAT GOES UP  MOST DEFINITELY WILL COME DOWN WITH A BANG. BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR INVESTMENTS. BE CAUTIOUS AND USE SAVINGS ACCOUNT AS WELL. WHEN STOCKS START FALLING BIG TIME, AT LEAST YOU WILL HAVE SOMETHING
1203 2018-05-24 13:30:47 The market refers to your prediction of particular etfs' or stocks or both?
1204 2018-05-24 13:29:09 Avoid stocks / sectors where there is excessive optimism in earnings estimate and valuations

It can be double-age sword

Reversals can give long lasting setback
1205 2018-05-24 13:28:42 @ofwealth Micro-cap stocks are the minnows of the stock markets. People invest in them in the hope that they grow into whales, delivering outsized returns along the way ... KS #microcap #smallcap
1206 2018-05-24 13:28:29 Maybe they should look into stock market too. LOL That does not happen here. The wild swings are just on individual stocks.

1221 2018-05-24 13:24:02 Even though the broader market had been choppy,the leadership factors remain risk seeking. High bets stocks  (quintile 1) have outperformed low bets stocks (quintile 5) by close to 300bps. SALES GROWTH is a leading factor.
1222 2018-05-24 13:23:57 Lots of money has been made - no question.  Lots still to be made.  I think that the likelihood of this market becoming over supplied and wrecking a lot of these startups is high.  Hanging out in mining stocks has certainly not been a treat over the last several months
1223 2018-05-24 13:23:48 ERR ON THE SIDE OF (CAUTION): decide that if you're going to make the wrong decision, it will be in a certain direction; have a tendency toward a certain belief or action. When investing in stocks for the first time, it's good to err on the side of caution.
1224 2018-05-24 13:23:43 Did it say “buy now while stocks last” ? Like it’s so good they only made a small amount

1228 2018-05-24 13:19:35 so we should sit in mining stocks and not make money, you do this for money
1229 2018-05-24 13:18:41 @realDonaldTrump MrPresident, I have fully supported you in finances, voting and heart.  Very respectfully, I do not agree on Amazon.  I like it and would like stocks to soar.  Thank you, for listening.
1230 2018-05-24 13:18:28 Whoa, very interesting if they'd only have 1 month gap between the date announcement & the release, gotta wonder how they'll handle the pre-order stocks O.o

(Games in JP usually had release dates announced ~3 months before release)
1231 2018-05-24 13:18:25 She talks a good talk but when you look into those financial reports and her  support for PolyMet which is funded by dark money, you see a different picture. She should renounce PolyMet and sell those financial and pharma stocks and put the money in a trust or a mutual fund.

1233 2018-05-24 13:16:14 Yes, Chicago sensitive to Black Sea production. A Rus crop of 70 or less is not going to work on world balance sheet. USDA usually behind curve on world demand. Are China's stocks real? We may find out this winter.
1234 2018-05-24 13:15:58 Nope, earnings go up as a result of more productivety & output. Corps may well be buying back stocks, but the main reason they're market caps are high is US Corp output offshore. Un fact, maybe that's why they're buying back stocks.
1235 2018-05-24 13:15:53 Stocks still aren't open yet? lol

1264 2018-05-24 13:03:11 I'm actually not saying they're not buying back stocks as much as I'm saying I don't see why they would. I believe you if you saw it. Aren't they basically sharing w shareholders?

1278 2018-05-24 12:55:37 Trump shouldn't be in the country. He is destroying it. Companys given tax breaks are buying back stocks, not giving raises and closing facilities. The cut was meant to make the rich richer, period. Kneeling for the anthem is a right bestowed by the Constitution.

1285 2018-05-24 12:52:32 Agree. But there is no guarantee that good conditions will return anytime soon. That is the risk we take by getting set early. Base on recent years however, I would suggest slowly accumulating positions in quality spec stocks over the next 4-6 weeks.

WW1 saw a lot of attachments from scopes (small not larger), bipods, larger magazines, clips, stocks, and some would modify their weapons with cloth to cut down on light reflection, tape to increase their grip.

1313 2018-05-24 12:39:56 Trump has endorsed letting states decide how to regulate marijuana, and the democrats are introducing legislation to decriminalize marijuana. This is a major boost for the legal pot industry and has lifted cannabis stocks, making it a great time to start buying into it.

1332 2018-05-24 12:28:26 I agree, my holding isn't massive so with any gains I have to decide if it's worth selling and forfeiting missing the the big bucks in the hope it drops back... easy to make the call after the event #GWMO

1336 2018-05-24 12:25:30 My local Morrison's definitely stocks Private Eye. Didn't realise they didn't stock TNE - just assumed that it was so popular that there were none left by the time I'd got there.

1349 2018-05-24 12:18:46 Sorry Dale, did not mean to give impression that I'm an expert on ASX. Only watch the larger cap stocks in a cursory way. I like & own Wesfarmers for upcoming spin-out of Coles and longer term tech picture. But there may be better value to be had.
1350 2018-05-24 12:17:54 Thank you very much, Karin. Your insights are always greatly appreciated. Just wish I had used a trailing S/L for certain stocks( especially looking at MEI & APN today! ). Now I just have to sit and wait for capital recovery! Thanks again. Regards
1351 2018-05-24 12:17:43 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
1352 2018-05-24 12:15:51 Not to nention, 80% of people who don't own stocks - see no benefit from high market caps. What that does show is why we have such income & wealth disparity. Now, to say we have highest market caps bcz we have more high cap corps, eg, FANGs is likely why caps higher than others
1353 2018-05-24 12:15:07 Happened to me, check their website it should show what they have in stock at each store.  But if someone buys it and checks out before you get there it's tricky if stocks are low.

1360 2018-05-24 12:10:25 I don't take exception to your comment about stocks. You can look at outstanding shares and see that they are buying back stocks. It is possible too that they are also investing overseas but that wouldn't drive up stock price like buying back shares does
1361 2018-05-24 12:09:24 Sorry Teketsi, did not mean to give impression that I'm expert on Oz market. Only follow the larger cap stocks in cursory way and only own 2 Oz stocks as investments. Can't help with the above unfortunately.
1362 2018-05-24 12:08:30 Tech stocks obscured the doldrums of the rest of the sectors.

1410 2018-05-24 11:34:50 Probably for the best tho that they are as you really must understand the risks with options as depending on the strategy (more so L3 and higher I believe), losses can, in theory, be unlimited, unlike going long on stocks where you can only lose what you put in.

1431 2018-05-24 11:21:12 Hi Tesco, is there a way for me to check which stocks actually have the steak in stock before going in? I’ve tried Congleton and Burnage (twice) but although they stock it they had sold out. Would like to get some today but don’t want to waste time going round loads of stores!
1432 2018-05-24 11:20:16 Not true. He's also guilty of insider trading, BTW. he is still having his broker buying/selling stocks and he is manipulating the the stock market with tweets about tariffs. Now THAT is a FEDERAL FELONY. Ask Martha Stewart.

Kalau mutual fund, if stocks they invest perform, dapat dividen, price per unit increase. Same goes for stocks lah.

Bond macam tu juga ke? Meaning return dia dapat dari investment?

1452 2018-05-24 11:07:07 Here’s the bottom line: We have no idea if anyone in Trump’s circle (or Trump himself) is shorting the stocks of the industries he attacks. Foreign autos. Amazon. Steel. The idea that @NancyPelosi isn’t vowing to impeach is both irresponsible and demotivating to the Dem base.

Me: For the last time, owning 2 stocks in Disney does not, in fact, make you a capitalist
1604 2018-05-24 09:05:21 Bank? A bank should not be trading stocks.
Take deposits.
Make loans. (Bonds?)
Receive interest.
Pay interest on deposits.

Anything more risks crippling the bank for the depositors.

If you want to be a stock brokerage, thats a second, seperate firm.

1918 2018-05-24 04:21:07 European stocks fell on Wednesday, weighed by the return of geopolitical concerns after US president Donald Trump’s latest comments on North Korea and the China trade talks, and as a round of disappointing eurozone data sparked concerns that the economic recovery was fading
1919 2018-05-24 04:20:22 This is a lie.  Wages remain stagnant. Companies are not hiring, they're buying back stocks artificially raising the price.  On jobs, you have to take into consideration the quality of jobs, under employment and those that have given up on finding a job.
1920 2018-05-24 04:20:21 US stocks rose on Wednesday, after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s 2 May meeting confirmed that policy makers support a June rate increase and are maintaining a calm attitude about the inflation outlook.
1921 2018-05-24 04:20:16 What I do is really very simple....

I have simple rules that tell me to engage the market or not.

If engaged I have 4 different scans in @MarketSmith that build my weekly watchlist. Week to week the list doesn’t change a lot.  50-75 stocks.

I rarely deviate from this list.
1922 2018-05-24 04:19:29 I will definitely buy it back again soon and would probably never short $TSLA (unless very short-term if something really negative were to come out). I tend not to short stocks anyway, it can be profitable but too nerve-racking and dangerous to me.
1923 2018-05-24 04:19:17 Steep fall in the market.

1952 2018-05-24 03:52:34 We are gradually reaching a stage where the rupee is falling because the rupee is falling. FIIs have sold Rs 17,249 crore of bonds this month. They have also sold Rs 6,972 crore worth of stocks.

2039 2018-05-24 02:55:47 yea. its the most comfortable to me. a couple drips and then the prefferds get paid as cash(no drip discount) and then i let it accrue and then i rebuy some stuff. + the few growth stocks just to have.
2040 2018-05-24 02:55:41 “allows a weapon to fire at NEARLY the rate of a machine gun” attaching a bump stock does not make a weapon automatic. Also, if you knew anything about bump stocks, they are hard to control and make the weapon very inaccurate.
2041 2018-05-24 02:54:22 I for sure want bump stocks banned. The average person doesn't need an automatic weapon.

2053 2018-05-24 02:46:45 Best part of it all was he hadn't yet even paid for the stocks he bought for pennies, apparently the cart carrying his cash was on the way from Germany.

2064 2018-05-24 02:35:21 The church shooter had a history of domestic violence. Take guns from anybody with violent histories for one. Ban bump stocks like in Vegas. Limit number of guns per person.

2162 2018-05-24 01:10:54 Hey has anybody been approached about that software for stocks and crypto etc. etc. I heard and read about it when it came out but... Just wondered has anybody tried it? Looking for input? Thanks @BerserkerSid

2165 2018-05-24 01:08:59 USDA:...growth in global imports are expected to lead to a drawdown in global stocks by 23 percent. Argentina, India, China, and the United States are likely to remain the primary exporters, with export growth projected only for China. U.S. exports are projected to decline 8%...
2166 2018-05-24 01:08:47 Sub 200% return over a decade is pathetic considering one could have seen more than a 500% return investing in a large number of tech stocks... and that's adjusted for risk.
2167 2018-05-24 01:08:25 OMG IM SO GLAD i wonder if theyre still floating around vintage stocks...
2168 2018-05-24 01:07:05 maybe.  depends on how the law comes down on the executives of Theranos.  from my perspective, they made a lot of money from salaries and whatever deals they made with their stocks (yes u can sell non-public stocks if u find a willing buyer)

Below 10500, Nifty will see selling pressure towards 10350

Above 10570, Nifty could see relief rally towards 10680

Watch first 5 min. Any bounce will be sold

2177 2018-05-24 00:57:52 Money is being recovered by selling the stocks of concerned company.
2178 2018-05-24 00:55:41 Yes. Believing in Horoscope readings and Fortune Cookies so weeks or months later people can say "that's what this meant" is BS for the week. Dressing it up as "Patriotic" is worse. It makes you a sucker for being scammed.

2181 2018-05-24 00:55:01 Are chodo sir, ur physhe is to remain opposite from market sentiments, just to look different from others, when market was up u were bearish now market down u suddenly become bullish, do you have any logic behind 1000 points rally?
2182 2018-05-24 00:55:01 #Stocks,#Indexes Well there was an SPX bottom signal about SPX=2715 today, before the final upswing. Had we spotted it real time we would have discounted it, so poorly organized was it.  This is an FYI; it does not get charted.
2183 2018-05-24 00:53:38 Doing some more studying on investments, stocks, bonds .. one thing black families don’t teach their kids is how to invest their money into something that’ll be bigger in the end for them.. it’s not taught idc idc idc.. & that’s where the money at!
2184 2018-05-24 00:51:50 Loser speaking. Last we know that @realDonaldTrump rolled back all of the regulations that paralyzed the economy. Stocks kept going up since November 8th 2016.  Let them talk trash until we lock them all up.

2186 2018-05-24 00:50:37 One would expect to start to hear of the chorus, of "June weakness," dull summer trading," "the worst part of yr to own stocks." Statistically true but never mandated in a particular year. Can't trad off of the,. $SPX $NDX $IWM
2187 2018-05-24 00:50:21 Is there an appearance of favoring the banking industry *because* Sen. Smith is invested in banking stocks? Just owning the stocks should not be a problem, especially when she voted to keep regulations on big banks.
2188 2018-05-24 00:50:00 @TheStreetBully WB would and has advised against investing in penny stocks, so there's that too.
2189 2018-05-24 00:49:44 @FrankelJeremy  Walmart, Wayfair, all getting in on Amazon Monopoly- sell you stocks.

2195 2018-05-24 00:44:14 But the stocks, guys! You're forgetting about the stocks! 
2196 2018-05-24 00:42:22 Don't get greedy though. EVERY board has someone or many people who think that stock is worth $100 billion/share. Odds are against you. Can it run to $X/share? Sure - But likely it won't in most otc stocks.

As for AXXA, I would keep an eye on how it interacts with the 50 day MA!
2197 2018-05-24 00:41:03 I doubt it's stock price will go down, unless all tech stocks decline. US is only one of many Countries with Netflix. Its price has been a long, pretty much uninterrupted, steady climb, for some time now. But we'll see.
2198 2018-05-24 00:40:59 Because this was a post about people offering hugs and plugging his stocks.
Context my friend.
2199 2018-05-24 00:40:42 @cheangming Which stocks?  I like BABA, JD, VIPS, YY.  What are your favorites?
2200 2018-05-24 00:40:37 Just learned that the ballot initiatives in GA were on a party-by-party and county-by-county basis, so only democrats were asked about Medicaid expansion and banning bump stocks and, apparently, the results mean nothing.

I will fight Trump

I will ban all assault riffles
(can't legally do that)
I will ban silencers & bump stocks.
(Trump already banned B.S.)
I will fund PP

Me : when a Hindi movie gets boring..u get an item number. Right?

Friend : correct

Me : adag stocks are item numbers of the Indian market 
2204 2018-05-24 00:35:57 Another part of the problem is the availability of assault weapons and bump stocks. The AR-15 is meant to kill people. It is not a firearm meant for hunting game. It is designed to create the maximum amount of bodily damage if not death.
2205 2018-05-24 00:35:27 Did you say stocks 
2206 2018-05-24 00:35:17 سيد اياد هل (اعمار) الذي يمتلك 70% من اعمار للتطوير بسعر (5.20) وسهم اعمار للتطوير 5.40 اليس هذا بأم الخيال ؟!؟  فلا تستغرب ان هبط الى 1.30 .. مع اعمار والعبار كل شيء جايز

2210 2018-05-24 00:33:32 No! He is done addressing/engaging with him. Until we see the portfolio of investments/stocks/bonds he has from the supposed drug money he has been rapping about.. until then Pusha should stop using Drake’s name. It’s pure jealousy..

2215 2018-05-24 00:29:56 We need closure on #TransMountain (May 31 deadline) and NAFTA; a few more months until they start building #KeystoneXL.  All should help us.  Until then, I will stay long/add to my Canadian e/p's and catch as much downside as possible too. $70 isn't priced in yet to our stocks.

2221 2018-05-24 00:24:40 Dims don't even comprehend how rediculous this is. Stealing a POTUS slogan???? They r now laughing stocks & will self destruct.

2224 2018-05-24 00:21:52 Stocks go up and down due to what people THINK will happen. It wouldn't surprise me that people invested as soon as they saw the Obama deal. You watch... it'll fall in the future.

2228 2018-05-24 00:17:38 If the objective is to cause terror and kill indiscriminately, a spray of bullets works fine. Las Vegas and countless other mass killings in the past year proved that. Which is why bump stocks, extended mags and drums need to all be banned first. No real-world value to sportsmen.
2229 2018-05-24 00:12:54 God you're an idiot. Stocks are MUCH MORE VALUABLE. Especially with a company that just sent a f@#$ing car to space.

2234 2018-05-24 00:05:44 I’ve heard crypto is a Ponzi scheme so much in the last few months. People I work with basically think there’s no way to make any money investing.  As they sit there getting excited about their stocks going up 20 cents
2235 2018-05-24 00:04:47 Start investing in stocks
2236 2018-05-24 00:04:34 Common sense gun laws: universal background checks, high capacity magazine ban restored, bump stocks outlawed, accountability for gun owners where a crime is committed with their registered gun. We also have a lot of work to do in our society and to help identify potential risks.
2237 2018-05-24 00:03:14 No doubt there is right but bump stocks? High cap magazines ? 2A does not indicate and founding fathers did not know what they are
