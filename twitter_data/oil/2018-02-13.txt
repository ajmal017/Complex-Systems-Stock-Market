1 2018-02-13 23:59:36 YOOO if you live in Fort Worth and need a job (oil & gas company) plz DM me. No experience needed. Traveling is REQUIRED. Job requires equipment handling on our oil & gas rigs. Start date ASAP. 
2 2018-02-13 23:59:30 Aw okay how much is the oil change?
3 2018-02-13 23:59:20 Shiiiiiit wasn’t able to wake up till 5 o’clock this afternoon. That canna oil got me good.

5 2018-02-13 23:58:52 I love the benefits of coconut oil but hate smelling like it.

7 2018-02-13 23:58:44 You should look into palm oil
8 2018-02-13 23:58:44 No Annette. I worked first as a High School Science teacher, and then as a scientist. The sky IS falling. You're being brainwashed by big oil and  vested interests who make money from the status quo.

10 2018-02-13 23:58:17 Does he know that oil currently brings in pretty much no revenue? Probably not.
11 2018-02-13 23:58:15 Mountain Dew tastes best while reading about how the bromated vegetable oil will kill you. I'm not drinking it as a post workout protein shake!
12 2018-02-13 23:57:59 (I've also used the one @T1mco suggested. I really like that one but same thing, I make my own chili oil)
13 2018-02-13 23:57:12 I need to go get an oil change Friday 
14 2018-02-13 23:57:02 We were already borrowing to pay salaries. The oil prices decline added and got us sliding downwards. 
Thankfully things are really looking good now
15 2018-02-13 23:56:48 Hugo Chavez of Venezuela gave several hundred million dollars of fuel oil to New England poor. The CIA attacked him and destabilized his country.

37 2018-02-13 23:56:08 Local voices don’t seem to matter when it comes to gun control or marijuana laws. I agree with you about opposing oil drilling off the SC coast.  But your repetition of “federalism, it’s the principle” is tiresome - like your pretend concern for debt.
38 2018-02-13 23:56:02 WAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA wala ka sea water ko na mas magaan pa sa oil. HAHAHAHHA
39 2018-02-13 23:55:58 That's only because he's got a donors financial interest and donor obligations at heart. If there were no donations he (& ALP) would have walked away from mining  coal, oil & gas long ago!

45 2018-02-13 23:55:16 This businesses , like Big Oil, Big Ag (Trump & GOP donors),  shipping & transportation, and biz of all sizes rely on weather info to know when and where to do what's needed.  Those NWS salaries are nothing compared to millions & billions lost due to lack of weather info.
46 2018-02-13 23:55:13 Twitter the same place that said we was running out of oil in 4 days, argue over dinner dates, choice of education & debate over marriages/kids y’all don’t have. Stop listening to these dumbasses on this app.

53 2018-02-13 23:54:30 i mean if you burn away all of the oil that you're frying it in, hell yeah
54 2018-02-13 23:53:58 Please learn about 5 stages of grief... denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Your oil industry is dying a painful death. You're at anger/bargaining stages. Please get to 'acceptance' so we can get on with living and working to make our collective future livable.
55 2018-02-13 23:53:58 While that may not be a good answer at the moment, nations avoid a recession at all cost because the consequences of being in one are grievous. That's one reason nations have reserves anyway. Venezuela was already headed in that direction the oil price drop just made it faster

61 2018-02-13 23:53:01 Greens also don't get how interconnected everything is, it isn't about greedy oil barons, it's thousands of direct jobs and millions of indirect jobs that are created because of oil revenue. Not forgetting that you couldn't live in many areas of Canada without using fossil fuels.

76 2018-02-13 23:50:40 We both referred to oil pipelines; I sent you an MSM-outlet-sourced link on that. I also addressed decades of upfront evidence of US/UK using carrots, sticks & bombs to get foreign govts. suited to US corporate interests, + US clearly prefers what Israel & KSA prefer in ME govts.
77 2018-02-13 23:50:34 Maybe we should reduce subsidies for oil & gas producers

Or eliminate carried interest exemptions

81 2018-02-13 23:50:11 Hi thank you. I usually use inks and tea etc but I am changing to oil paints which works from dark to light instead of light to dark so I feel all confused!  this is just oil paints but I need some thinner brushes. Have fun

84 2018-02-13 23:49:49 Let’s not just talk about cash bribes, let’s talk about drilling and exporting of the oil only to sell it back to the people the oil was obtained from in the first place.

86 2018-02-13 23:49:36 Oil companies are notorious for keeping environmental incidents quiet - even ignited blowouts. This one is easy to trace. Oil & Marine Manuli is the Scottish Manufacturer, GPHOM 2009 is the standard to which they were manufactured - 2009 being the revision year. Ask the maker!
87 2018-02-13 23:49:25 Holy shiet!!!! That looks delish! What oil you use for seasoning?
88 2018-02-13 23:49:22 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

95 2018-02-13 23:48:29 import of oil & coal is part of the US backed UN sanctions against NK.

really, complaining that people are suffering but ignoring that it is directly from the actions of the US & UN is baffling.   You just parrot out the party line like a bunch of paid puppets, zero effort

97 2018-02-13 23:47:55 How removing Syria from the axis of resistance would be worse than having a strong Syria supporting it? Does that really need to be explained? For starters, they'd relinquish rights to the Golan Heights, in which Israel with Genie energy is wanting to drill and steal oil from.
98 2018-02-13 23:47:28 Had a friend, they use to get these huge tin buckets of peanut butter the kind with the oil, you had to stir it up first (by huge like a gallon) and yes the cheese.
99 2018-02-13 23:47:14 What I don't like about Greens running the show is that they've probably never built anything bigger than IKEA shelves and haven't a clue how long it would take to transition from fossil fuels or realize how many other non fuel products are made from oil.
100 2018-02-13 23:47:08 Dearest Andrew — Your constant talk of squirrel oil has left your father and I deeply troubled. Addiction stunts the development of many on the prairie, although peyote remains our main threat to intellectual skill. Many offer help...will you take it? We call this “intervention.”
101 2018-02-13 23:47:06 They had to return for an oil prince who forgot to get on?
102 2018-02-13 23:46:17 If you’re not vegan/vegetarian I usually do either a fried egg or a poached egg on top of ramen with soy sauce and sesame oil, and with 1/4-1/2 cup of baby spinach cooked and added into the ramen
103 2018-02-13 23:45:56 Just noticed they say - 'fuel curiosity, spark imagination' -with dog biscuits to make fossils? We used plaster and twigs+small rocks to make impressions + brown oil pastels to make it look 'old'. (after our video about fossils)
104 2018-02-13 23:45:54 Interesting take. I would have guessed he wanted seats in AB, since shutting down oil sands would cut 8% of emissions at a cost of 2% of GDP. Or maybe he just wants AB to not hate him even more.

108 2018-02-13 23:45:40 Am afraid City will win the lot this season. Oil money aside, they have been magnificent this season. Guardiola has without doubt raised the bar this season. It's up to United and Mourinho to catch up now. Even as a Utd I have to say they are my tip for the UCL.

110 2018-02-13 23:45:29 Wow, today I am learning the effect of aroma oil in ramen.
To begin with, I wondered if it was just the mushrooms but it's got both an slight nutty, garlicy smell and taste which is definitely from the garlic oil I made.
I have a whole new range of flavours to look into now!
111 2018-02-13 23:45:19 Thank you for spreading the word! With coconut oil, lavender and chamomile this 100% natural makeup remover is gentle yet effective.
112 2018-02-13 23:44:56 Okay I’m actually triggered bc @Apple music doesn’t have “oil and water” by cady groves! 
113 2018-02-13 23:44:48 Did you see Houston? The flooding? That was worse by the fact that they had no environmental controls.

Roadways get covered in oil, fuel, etc.. Where does the rainwater runoff go? Into a clean water stream? Through a neighborhood?

119 2018-02-13 23:43:47 Outrageously good! Are you using oil paints with brushes or crayons? I'm starting to draw this week with ink and pastel crayons and it's taking me some practice to get the hang of them.
120 2018-02-13 23:43:45 Well, that’s embarrassing. But now that the regulations on the oil industry have been lifted, maybe Louisiana can turn that around a little bit. 8 years of globalist policies put us at the top of that list. Let’s see if Trump’s policies work better for us.
121 2018-02-13 23:43:30 It’s not just dairy boo. Oil and coal consumption is the driving force. If China can implement a clean energy program, I don’t see why we can’t. Sweden is 100% clean energy.
122 2018-02-13 23:43:15 Suggestion for re-write "On Oct 11th they drove on roads built using OIL powered equipment with their white sedan built by using steel & minerals mined by OIL powered equip, transported by OIL powered equip to manufacturing facilities powered by fossil fuel generated energy" etc

128 2018-02-13 23:42:31 Also in 1978-79, the Iran Hostage crisis sent oil prices thru the roof.
129 2018-02-13 23:42:24 Sorry I'm a new follower. I blame Poloz the much for this situation.  There was no need to cut rates two years ago when oil tanked.  It wasn't going to bring jobs back, but it did fuel a bubble.
130 2018-02-13 23:42:13 LMAO I regret giving my dog coconut oil all the time. I use coconut oil as lube and he keeps bustin into the room n trying to smell us.
131 2018-02-13 23:41:48 Love how cost of oil dropped over $6 a barrel yet cost of gas in LA hasn’t moved.  Uh-huh

140 2018-02-13 23:39:47 I'm sure it has *something* to do with oil exports and production from and within Scotland, but it's not really very... specific to those, is it?
141 2018-02-13 23:39:30 いってらっしゃー！
142 2018-02-13 23:39:29 Today I learnt that when making pancakes your only suppose to add a tiny bit of oil (instead I filled up half the frying pan with oil and fried it) think next year I’ll buy the ready made ones 
143 2018-02-13 23:39:24 So your assertion that the federal government is harming the east coast offshore oil sector is silly
144 2018-02-13 23:39:20 But subsidies for oil remain of course. GW Bush was a saint compared to this man.
145 2018-02-13 23:39:19 あぁっ残念！牡蠣は美味しいのでございます(*´-`)
146 2018-02-13 23:39:16 It’s where Trump gets his money from. Laundering Russian oil money. Or chromium money. And our Secretary of State is a former oil CEO. It’s all about the oil.
147 2018-02-13 23:39:07 washed my car, got and oil change, and just finished grocery shopping. 
148 2018-02-13 23:39:03 A territory is like a side bitch. “You’re not good enough to be mine, l just use you... until you discover some oil or we need you for a military base in a word war.”
149 2018-02-13 23:38:59 Must be tough in New England since the subsidized oil for the poor deal with Venezuela went, literally, south.
150 2018-02-13 23:38:50 Don't forget the oil pipelines Donny. Your plan would make it easier for oil and gas companies to go around environmental regulations. Don't ever forget who @realDonaldTrump works for. Corporations. The #forgottenman continues to be forgotten.
151 2018-02-13 23:38:45 This is my go to oil after a nice shower.
152 2018-02-13 23:38:40 It's almost like we live in s utopia where 1 in 5 children don't go to bed hungry, a generation isnt plagued with student loan debt, and even insured people don't go broke paying medical bills. 

Cuz clearly we should be giving handouts to Wall St & Oil companies. #Budget2018

160 2018-02-13 23:37:50 That's a graph for crude oil *consumption*. You did read the title, didn't you? And it's for the UK, not Scotland.
161 2018-02-13 23:37:42 So when the Port of Vancouver was expanded, one could surmise that there was an increase in Container Ship traffic. Are Container ships better at steering around whales? I ask because we seem narrowly focused on Oil Tankers and not other ships.
162 2018-02-13 23:37:09 CBD oil is amazing too.

No,100% wrong. Half the country doesn't want that, they want coal and oil. We'd have the exact same government.

176 2018-02-13 23:35:08 I need to make you all understand something. Truffles & Truffle oil are not the same thing. Truffles are magnificent & there is absolutely no truffle oil involved in any part. Truffle oil is useless & an abuser of all food. Also, no truffles were harmed in this tweet...

183 2018-02-13 23:33:48 and did anyone ask where all the money is coming from? We have a resource based economy. No oil and gas no health care or education. No child care or affordable housing

211 2018-02-13 23:28:13 I'm more for leaving the oil in the ground. For years we were warned about the danger of petrochemical use, now our nightmares are becoming reality. We need to start producing alternatives. Biofuel and wind/solar are natural fits for the the prairie provinces.

223 2018-02-13 23:26:40 We are planning a pilot project to show that our formula can fully remediate the oil & Corexit residuals & also jumpstart restoration & natural rebalancing of the ecosystem.

228 2018-02-13 23:25:35 Venezuela was also an oil dependent economy. 

See,  some of our 'experts' want us to fully expose the oil industry to market forces. Prices of PMS will probably shoot up to N250-N500. Would people be able to afford that? NO. Who gets d blame for dat if adopted? The govt not them

255 2018-02-13 23:21:38 But, that’s the GOP mentality. It’s the “I got mine, so fuck you” mentality. The refusal to participate in a society, because *gasp* their tax dollars might go to helping those in need, and not killing brown people overseas for oil.

That Is the sad reality of america.

267 2018-02-13 23:20:29 Moon's plan involves shipping Russian gas and oil through a pipeline built through the North, which would provide jobs and leasing money to the impoverished DPRK.

323 2018-02-13 23:14:16 It might have been sperm oil as well which is. Slightly different i think? Its just whale oil except. From sperm whales. Its all weird gunky stuff either way

336 2018-02-13 23:12:56 Me @ Dr Oz in his Turkish Air commercial: Don’t fucking tell me what to do, snake oil salesman.
Nana: I don’t think he can hear you, sweetie, but you tell him anyway!
337 2018-02-13 23:12:53 Great!  We can get all those oil wells up and drilling a lot quicker off our beautiful beaches and build over our wet lands polluting them with toxic waste.
338 2018-02-13 23:12:48 But you can’t treat people this way. She’s clearly learned somewhere along the way that the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
339 2018-02-13 23:12:34 The "new" process will be no better. It's time for governments in Canada to stop favouring big oil companies over their own citizens. There will always be jobs, but the same cannot be said about our southern killer whales.
340 2018-02-13 23:12:23 Do you read the news Robin? US shale oil  production is likely to exceed Saudi Arabia. Or do you only read little England news?

343 2018-02-13 23:11:56 Question for anyone who’s used an oil diffuser - do they work or is it all a big sham?
344 2018-02-13 23:11:41 Well, Hillary Clinton stated it as being of benefit to Israel, as I mentioned. Another reason is the Saudi-US deal for running an oil pipeline through Syria. President Assad had rejected the Saudi proposal, and opted for a deal with Iran and Iraq instead.

351 2018-02-13 23:11:09 Well pay for the oil you stole. Tjat5 should put them right
352 2018-02-13 23:11:03 That's why we left them all that oil - plus all the bundles of cash that were spread around.
353 2018-02-13 23:11:03 That's why they are raising the entrance prices! Many people couldn't or wouldn't pay those prices. Less foot traffic would give oil and gas companies more freedom to operate.

442 2018-02-13 23:01:21 @PrepIsKing hi Michael, I'm after some advice about osmo. I have a client that wants external cladding with a lime wash effect. Is that possible with polyx white and followed by uv protection oil? Or would that not work externally? Thanks, Lee
443 2018-02-13 23:01:15 Wal-Mart. What if public partnership produced a product with more food at lower cost? It could work.
444 2018-02-13 23:01:00 Been there... and PROUD OF IT... when I imagine that I'm somehow denying subsidies to the OIL Industry & "project-development money" to the M/I Complex. ^..^
445 2018-02-13 23:01:00 A Haiku: 

I just cleansed my locs. 
Bitch, they smell like coconuts. 
Sealed with pure shea oil.
446 2018-02-13 23:00:55 Why isn’t the State of New Mexico regulating emissions from our oil industry !?!?!?
447 2018-02-13 23:00:26 OIL DIFF: 3.68 -> 3.76
448 2018-02-13 22:59:34 Trouble brewing after the big gas/oil find
449 2018-02-13 22:59:31 Boom in U.S. oil drilling might mean cheaper gas prices this year. - just heard on radio
450 2018-02-13 22:59:21 Such nonsense.  Oil demand projected to increase in foreseeable future. The problem is it will just come from elsewhere. What product on the planet is made without oil as key precursor....please name one....and how that product will be replaced in your post oil world....
451 2018-02-13 22:59:03 I use Tarte Maracuja Oil for my skin scalp and hair when I don’t forget. It’s amazing!
452 2018-02-13 22:59:00 Why is the inside of my car the absolute messiest right when I go and get an oil change 
453 2018-02-13 22:58:57 If you used the microwave that's your mistake. Try reheating it in a skillet with a little bit of oil or butter
454 2018-02-13 22:58:39 Snake oil salesman got his voters to choose   class and race over truly improving their economic circumstances. He knew his target market and he sold them. Hail VSG!
455 2018-02-13 22:58:34 How many times must it be repeated that the US simply returned money to Iran that was frozen in 1979? It was their money! Like the oil on Golan and Afrin is Syrian oil. But when the Rothschilds and satanists want what you have, then you are labeled a terrorist by their sycophants
456 2018-02-13 22:58:32 It is still above 2007 levels which is still very high. By the way, if we have a recession for 1 or 2 years, SPX earnings will tank big again. Earnings are very volatile - you saw what just one sector - oil - did to earnings in 2015.
457 2018-02-13 22:58:25 I remember when my mother used to give me castor oil when I was sick.The castor oil my mother gave me tasted horrible.

458 2018-02-13 22:58:19 In its #ThroneSpeech, BCNDP announce development of new climate plan in coming months, targeting fugitive emissions in oil and gas industry; carbon tax hike; new protections against oil spills that pose 'significant risk to our economy and environment' #bcpoli #ableg
459 2018-02-13 22:58:17 Why does oil and gas make a rainbow on the ground?
460 2018-02-13 22:58:16 Libs wanna keep the bad oil in the ground. They despise the west and try to sabotage any success in Alberta.
461 2018-02-13 22:58:10 Do you add oil or leave it dry?
462 2018-02-13 22:58:07 ALREADY getting yelled at and I just walked in the door. I grabbed the wrong thing to check my oil, my bad. now because my oil is low , my problemmm howwwww ???

464 2018-02-13 22:57:55 How about spend 12 million on our infrastructure and tell the US to pay for the damage they did in Iraq for no reason other than oil.  The stupidity of gov't.  this why we have high taxes ..  StupidKind People !!

467 2018-02-13 22:57:34 The marijuana debate continues with CBD oils gaining just as much attention. If you are vaping with CBD oil I have seen it test positive with the NIK presumptive test kit for marijuana. #cbdoil #police #attorney #lawyer #bikerwithabarcard
468 2018-02-13 22:57:27 this is our punishment for allowing the BP oil spill to happen

Looking at about $57 to keep support going for the up plan to $75.  Below $55 begins to kill it. For now $75 still the main campaign plan big pict.

477 2018-02-13 22:56:47 It works because of the oil. Dirty little secret: that's what props up the Scandinavian societies as well.

UBI is a good idea, but Alaska's model is not reproducible everywhere.
478 2018-02-13 22:56:45 Hey, @EsotericExposal how much tea tree oil do I have to butt-chug to get this @realDonaldTrump clown out of office. Need an answer in the next 10 minutes plz...

481 2018-02-13 22:56:41  go on - 100g flour, 2 eggs, 300ml milk, 1 tbsp oil, plus a little extra for frying - you know it makes sense (especially if you have Nutella in the house)

483 2018-02-13 22:56:31 They're pissed because I can buy a single rib standing rib roast for Christmas, on sale at Safeway for $12. It lasted 5 days.
Cali gives me cash, so it isn't apparent I'm using SNAP. In Washington I had a card. I'd get looks for buying meat, organics, olive oil.
484 2018-02-13 22:56:29 I wonder when shale oil pops 
485 2018-02-13 22:56:15 Thank goodness that the oil execs can still put wine on the table.
486 2018-02-13 22:56:07 You the beautiful girl /woman /minister /Jewish correctly said to declare your state as Jewish state after present day position in mid east where existence of once oil reach independent countries are in stake, Palestine  problem has been auto solved as per your new concept !!!
487 2018-02-13 22:55:56 Lanolin, Shea butter, and vitamin e oil. Greasy as you think but it works.
488 2018-02-13 22:55:48 So this restaurant think it’s ok to fully drown my haleem in oil. No. That is NOT ok. They should just take it off the menu completely tbh. Complete disaster 
489 2018-02-13 22:55:42 Minimum wages which isn't up to minimum when compared to other countries we claiming 'Giant' to are paying, we use Jesus beg Anobi before getting paid after 3 months late. Now they want state in dependency, with many of them depending on oil revenue & embezzling, Aren't dey mad?
490 2018-02-13 22:55:42 Idk who u are but this just popped up on my timeline and get some oil of oregano from a GNC or pharmacy and hold a full dropper under ya tongue and let it absorb. Do it for like 3 days straight and it kills bacteria and can stop a flu from flaring up! Xoxo
491 2018-02-13 22:55:40 Oil and filter changes are life bro!
492 2018-02-13 22:55:31 multivitamin and fish oil are good. But if you eat right you really don’t need either.
493 2018-02-13 22:55:29 おはようございます。そうなんですよ！もらうモノに差があって、それも同じ会社の人からだったりすると・・・ってなるとやっぱりめんどくさいですもんねー。頭痛いです(´；ω；`)ｳｩｩ
494 2018-02-13 22:55:23 What risk ?
What about Angola, is there no risk thee ?
How are thy able to do it with less foreign reserve ?
Or is Angola foreign reserve 2x our own ?
Why is there own oil output 2x our own ?
495 2018-02-13 22:55:02 Their goes the oil pan
496 2018-02-13 22:55:02 Industry insiders for oil painters incl. folks who eat their paints & chop off their ears. If the sperm on the portrait meets an egg, does the First Lady's portrait then bring the baby to term? I wouldn't walk past that painting in the gallery unprotected, if I were you or me!
497 2018-02-13 22:54:58 Make sure its well drained and pressed, roll it in cornflour and herbs, fry in a liiiiittle bit of oil  the only way I can eat it and even my omni boyfriend loves it!
498 2018-02-13 22:54:53 It is....it started lower....around $40 and is now over $60...the monthly production figures are available. ...

Just type in "UK oil production"

And click on a few links...

Can you manage it?
499 2018-02-13 22:54:47 Brominated Vegitable Oil is banned in Europe and China & has some icky side effects.... BUT THAT DOESN’T STOP AMERICANS FROM PUTTING IT IN MNT. DEW 

Look at the bottom ingredient on your can/ bottle next time & research it yourself.
500 2018-02-13 22:54:40 Oil changes are the worst.
501 2018-02-13 22:54:37  Has anyone ever asked "water" and "oil" why they never mixed? The #SmallDetails are adding up and connecting.
502 2018-02-13 22:54:22 I think y'all presume too much. US wants to protect oil interests in ME. That's been bedrock of our policy for decades. IS and Al Quaeda interfered on US. PKK may be designated terrorist but reality is US support autonomy for Kurds.
503 2018-02-13 22:54:21 Oh No!  Massaging with mineral oil has helped me with some smaller stains, I hope you find a solution!
504 2018-02-13 22:54:18 Why would I get a significant other when my friend’s husband will change the oil in my car for me? #realtalk
505 2018-02-13 22:54:06 Maybe next he'll take oil companies, farmers and banks off the dole.
506 2018-02-13 22:54:03 I never appreciate my eyesight untill I have coconut oil in my eyes

508 2018-02-13 22:53:42 Pilot program makes more available at lower cost. Fraud would then be focused on the credit card program. It could be an option.
509 2018-02-13 22:53:40 @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott   There was federal employee in Myrtle Beach today to talk OFF SHORE Drillong I did not see either of you. Just the ex governor Florida is exempt. You must stop this now! If we get oil on our beaches this economy will fail
510 2018-02-13 22:53:27 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
511 2018-02-13 22:53:24 Real talk all I want for Valentines Day is for my oil to get changed in my car
512 2018-02-13 22:53:23 my oil change took less than 20 minutes, they didn't charge me for guac at chipotle, and i just found a well written jaeyong assassins au god is real good today
513 2018-02-13 22:53:06 I need  oil change
514 2018-02-13 22:53:01 RIGHT! So Trident is moving south?..that be a start of what is best for Scotland. Then we will build a massive transport Hub/Dock  & start drilling on West coast for all the untouched Oil Thanks you!
515 2018-02-13 22:52:53 Not to mention we will have more renewables by the time the plant comes on line.This is strictly so those with $ in gas don’t go the way of other fossils like coal and oil because the plant has a 30yr life. It ensures we MUST keep gas around for at least 30yrs and their $ is safe
516 2018-02-13 22:52:51 Of course you know one is gonna slick one set with oil so it triggers off too early, the other will plug it up with kauri offcuts...
517 2018-02-13 22:52:38 Pagi : fw - kangen water - toner - face oil - soothing gel - sunscreen
Siang(kalo habis pergi aja) : mc - mw - soothing gel - sunscreen
Malem : sama kaya pagi tp ditambah serum sebelum face oil, acne gel setelah face oil, aplikasi soothing gel nya didouble (?) & ga pake sunscreen

519 2018-02-13 22:52:13 And every day is a perfect yield, and the price of oil doesn't change. It's all averaged out I'm sure.
520 2018-02-13 22:51:43 Won't the white one eventually yellow as almost all oil based products do?
521 2018-02-13 22:51:40 From the #ThroneSpeech: "Research is underway on ways to address fugitive emissions in the oil and gas sector, and slash burning."

We need the #carbontax on these emissions THIS YEAR, not after research. This is potentially a huge walk-back from the NDP. #bcpoli #climatechange
522 2018-02-13 22:51:33 Yeah Delta and (I think) AA still fly them. They’ll be gone next time oil prices start soaring again.

524 2018-02-13 22:51:10 It’s kinda been like that since Ancient Greece. That’s why they used to wrestle naked and covered in oil.
525 2018-02-13 22:51:00 Spending #ValentinesDay at home? Create a spa atmosphere, bring out some oil & give one another a back massage or foot rub
526 2018-02-13 22:50:56 Beard oil.
527 2018-02-13 22:50:52 Went to get an oil change on Sunday (hours say they’re open), but the service station was closed. Went to get an oil change today (hours say they’re open until 8), but the service station closed at 5. 

I’m pissed.

535 2018-02-13 22:50:08 Coconut oil is one of the healthiest food you can eat.
from over 3000 studies around the world it is 
one of the most powerful anti viral foods known
to humans. If you are worried about the flu, 
go ahead and get some Organic raw coconut oil
it can drop the viral load quickly.

541 2018-02-13 22:48:22 The oil spot price over the year and production figures are readily available for you to go and check....

Take off your socks of the numbers get too big
542 2018-02-13 22:48:21 Sitting on my phone for an hour is so boring and inconvenient when I’m waiting for something like an oil change. However, if my “To Do” list is crazy long I will sit on my phone for well over five hours NO PROBLEM.
543 2018-02-13 22:47:55 I have known Dave Hughes for many years & he is a 1st rate geologist, objective & has great knowledge about oil and gas. I trust him and his work.
544 2018-02-13 22:47:37 Hehe. I don't have sugar in my pantry & am out of lemons!  Used agave syrup on mine, with berries & coconut yoghurt, mint leaves. Pancakes made w egg, flour & oat milk; cooked w coconut oil. Yum 
545 2018-02-13 22:47:28 Keep up the good work DEMS. And KARLA. I knew the AMERICANS would finally see through TRUMP and his SLIGHT OF HAND. ALL SNAKES AND SNAKE OIL! You can Laugh out of the other side of your face TRUMP!
546 2018-02-13 22:47:27 That’s like overhauling the fuel injection system of a GTO but taking it out before changing the oil.
547 2018-02-13 22:47:12 Oil companies that turned around and took billions of investment dollars to other countries.  If what you say is true Energy East,the Petronas LNG and Kinder Morgan would be all underway. Instead over 50 billion of investment gone,gov revenue slush fund carbon tax instead
548 2018-02-13 22:47:08 Washed deep condition, then a tea tree oil treatment and twist it up . I wanna try some new methods . I just gotta make time to practice.
549 2018-02-13 22:47:06 Beats macadamia nut beard oil 
550 2018-02-13 22:47:04 And in a pinch I've used coconut oil when out of beard oil.
551 2018-02-13 22:47:00 i might actually finally get my hair cut tomorrow since my oil change/rotation and balance were so fucking cheap, ya girl bout to feel brand new
552 2018-02-13 22:46:50 Thursday price changes. Substantial price drops on the way: Heating/stove oil to drop by 5.3 cents a  litre. Diesel to drop by 5.6 cents a litre. Gasoline to drop by 5.1 cents a litre. Lower oil and score on higher inventories last week. U.S domestic also a factor. #gaspricesnl
553 2018-02-13 22:46:45 Deep conditioning and hot oil treatments once a week. It will work wonders.
554 2018-02-13 22:46:34 So these were not Russian oil companies.
555 2018-02-13 22:46:10 And he is right, nothing you provided gave the export (or revenue) figures for oil and gas. You've just plucked some numbers from your arse.
556 2018-02-13 22:45:54 Doing it in a shoestring compared to oil rich countries has something to do with it
557 2018-02-13 22:45:43 This is Chinas real chance to dominate the world automobile industry, lots of Government's are probably under pressure from big oil not to go the EV way, but we all know thats its inevitable and big oil's destructive path is no longer acceptable....
558 2018-02-13 22:45:29 should i buy this 42 dollar custom face oil?!
559 2018-02-13 22:45:21 Nudes are overrated. It's 2018. I want an oil paint delivered by messenger on horseback. Not a text.
Put some effort in for God sakes 
560 2018-02-13 22:45:11 So much salt in this comment section from Vancouverites with apparently no grasp on Albertan politics... our province needs to break the oil price differential to speed diversification and prepare us for a just energy transition. Notley's plan does that.
561 2018-02-13 22:45:06 After beginning to cook, I realized that I'd made the novice mistake of setting the pan heat way too high.  The oil was burning on contact.
562 2018-02-13 22:45:00 Buhari holding on to the oil portfolio is neither nor there. Kachiukwu is the man in charge and Buhari does not disturb him.
563 2018-02-13 22:44:41 I want to do a few oil paintings but DAMN the set up is expensive as hell. 
564 2018-02-13 22:44:33 I get more notifications from my car that it needs an oil change than I get texts in a day
565 2018-02-13 22:44:29 I got Jason and the Argan Oil. It is wonderful, i'm so happy i got it. Thank you for reminding me to get it,

571 2018-02-13 22:42:48 I’m so sad I can’t use my oil diffuser cuz I found out essential oils are toxic to cats 
572 2018-02-13 22:42:38 Hi!! unfortunately we do not have samples of the Dry Oil! The only thing we suggest is you could purchase/try and return if you're not happy! xo
573 2018-02-13 22:42:30 CCS will have negligible impact on oil. Frankly, so will EVs, b/c cheap oil will get diverted mostly into plastics, fertilizers. This is whack-a-mole oil that no one is really confronting.

575 2018-02-13 22:42:26 I'll gather detailed info for you on that as time permits; for starters, when does the US/UK ever NOT want a govt. in any country that defers to its judgments, accommodates its banking & oil cartels, and (especially here) has the approval of govts. in Israel and Saudi Arabia?

580 2018-02-13 22:42:04 I got so much shit to do tomorrow. I gotta get my hair done, get an oil change, redo chapter one of my conceptual paper, meet with professors and go to class.
581 2018-02-13 22:41:57 Good news: My Thieves oil came in the mail 
Bad news: My apartment has mice again
582 2018-02-13 22:41:48 It would be awesome to get a oil change without the hassles and upsales that come with getting an oil change.
583 2018-02-13 22:41:29 Agree  %. This snake oil salesman needs to go back to Oklahoma and ravage THEIR natural and monetary resources. He’s been bad news from the start. The only reason he’s still around is because he’s a sneaky SOB who knows how to fly under the radar.

635 2018-02-13 22:33:28 It was just a theme to rile up his gullible base.  They fell for it so the snake oil salesman dishes out more lies and bullshit along with Propaganda Arm FakeFox.  #GullibleBase #LiarinChief #TrumpCrimeFamily
636 2018-02-13 22:33:04 Remember back in 2017 when Trudeau said he would phase out the oil sands? That's what he is doing now. Yeah he says Trans Mountain will go through. I will only believe him if/when the project is finished.

650 2018-02-13 22:31:46 Good point. There's a lot of snake oil being sold. This weakens the entire ecosystem. At some point those problems mount up and become everyone's problem.

661 2018-02-13 22:30:42 Also, let's just say that you're right. Does that mean that when the oil price was $100/barrel, we'd have been make £33bn/year?

668 2018-02-13 22:30:11 I like it. I was getting an oil change and tires rotated at the dealership. Faux News was on in the waiting room so I grabbed the remote and changed it to MSNBC. Several people looked at me but didn't say a word. For me it was change the channel or throw something at the TV.

671 2018-02-13 22:29:33 Nothing perplexing about it. Don't believe it was anything more than a rogue attempt bt Wagner mercenaries to take the oil facility in order to profit from the 25% share of proceeds in the Evro Polis contract.

688 2018-02-13 22:27:37 Why when I go to get an oil change my air filter is always “bad” yo. 
689 2018-02-13 22:27:29 I prefer the essential oil. 3-5 drops under the tongue 2-3 times daily. Make sure it has at least 80% carvacrol. Bit of a blast at first, chase with water, but you get used to it and it’s a better delivery than capsules.

691 2018-02-13 22:27:13 If I went up to a boss and said "I'm doing nothing because it's going to happen anyway", I'd get fired. Tillerson is former oil executive. If that is how he ran Exxon, then we are all qualified to be CEO of Exxon. Even a 6 month old could do nothing.

698 2018-02-13 22:25:26 @RajKSinghIndia sir, as you know, SC banned pet coke and fuel oil which impacted SMEs badly. We can promote electricity for process operation which increases electricity consumption and investments and jobs and reduce air pollution. Pleased to speak to you

701 2018-02-13 22:25:15 Its great that @Sen_B_Richards refuses to work with big oil, but the unfortunate truth is that America is not ready.

721 2018-02-13 22:23:31 You forgot to throw in the 7 oil fields his old war criminal leader Tony Blair stole from Scotland . Fecking crooks the lot of you no shame and only working fir the British Establishment.  #GetToFeckCorbyn
722 2018-02-13 22:23:25 Alberta does oil better then anyone else in the world.  Environment, manpower, tech.  We can’t be beat.

724 2018-02-13 22:23:00 What is wrong with rewarding sucess monetarily? Risk reward equation works as current lift reasearch/ investment proves.
725 2018-02-13 22:22:58 disgusting ppl effectively creating worst swamp of all-he's a racist-he's opened up beautiful public lands to private gas/oil  interests-he attacks every value that IS  American-free press, freedom  of religion,diversity&continually violates  the Constitution he  swore to protect
726 2018-02-13 22:22:57 Energy is literally the ability to do work, and Trump's actions seem pointed at making the ability to do work a more expensive proposition.  Even Keystone XL pipeline is aimed at that: it's supposed to take tar sands oil out of the glutted north American market, increase price.
727 2018-02-13 22:22:55 I once went to a house party with Dewey Evans, Wade Boggs and Odibe McDowell where we witnessed a young Roger Clemens attempt to have sex with a giraffe Oil Can Boyd stole from a zoo. God should have killed all of us that night. This is Peter Gammons.
728 2018-02-13 22:22:53 Are we convinced bonds are in a bear market? Oil I think is a bull market. The price has doubled.
729 2018-02-13 22:22:53 @FreePressOKC This is not fake news. They need to be voted out of office. I would like to see the contributions from oil and gas. @ClaudiaSwisher @The___Whistle
730 2018-02-13 22:22:52 That seemed to almost rely on science, which I thought was outlawed as elitist by this Administration.  Too bad we don't know why the ice is melting or what could prevent those approaching floods.  Maybe burning more oil and coal could turn that water to steam and stop floods

732 2018-02-13 22:22:51 Well of course you are free to estimate what ever you like. The reality is ; your small enclave at North Syria is already gone. 

BTW, before you accuse of anyone supporting another marginal group , you have to quit being puppets of 'oil hunting 'imperialists anc ome clean.

736 2018-02-13 22:22:27 I just use Suave shampoo for my hair and body wash because it's cheap.  I'm naturally dubious of all the "snake oil" type products people are conned into purchasing.  I assume 95% are just overpriced soap or worse.

779 2018-02-13 22:17:34 @WSPAPrez Do you know if any US oil companies are planing to get into the Somalia for oil exploration, refineries or even gas-station chains. I am sick and tired of seeing companies from other countries benefit from it. When the US military personnel sacrifice and die for them.

782 2018-02-13 22:17:09 15 billion barrells is an understimated value for tight oil reserves in United States. That would mean that, at the current rate of 6.646 mmB/d, they have reserve for approximately 6.5 years. Please correct me if I am wrong. These numbers doesn't make sense for me.

794 2018-02-13 22:15:39 Why even have discussion on any scenario of oil rising? Right now WTI is doing what it must....fall. Now you #OOTTmoron s are going to feel the pain. Keep word salad-ing.

799 2018-02-13 22:15:09 So @audipenny I just read your @fodorstravel writeup of the Corn Palace while waiting to get my oil changed. I don’t say this lightly, but you might just be the greatest travel writer since Paul Theroux. I thought you should know. Ok have a good life.
800 2018-02-13 22:14:41 Yea I forgot what we were even talking about at this point lol. Twitter is good for that. It got me through the waiting room at the oil change place haha
801 2018-02-13 22:14:36 If I end up buried in an oil drum in the Warner Bros backlot it’s all your fault.
802 2018-02-13 22:14:30 People work in all kinds of industries. Film projectionists, print media,postal workers & many others lost jobs in obsolete industries.The fact that people work in the oil industry doesn't mean we should fight better alternatives that won't ruin the planet.
803 2018-02-13 22:14:28 Oil sands bitumen is one of the most expensive to extract and expensive to refine heavy, low-quality oils on the market.  Investors are running away for a reason and that reason is NOT lack of pipelines - it's economics 101.

Easier to shoot all the damned oil into space so we stop ruining everything by burning it down here.

Meanwhile, our aquifers are in crisis.

813 2018-02-13 22:13:12 Lost in the argument about drilling for oil off the SC coast: there's no oil deposits off our coast that are feasible to financially recover. Period.
All we have are natural gas hydrates-which are not commercially viable.

825 2018-02-13 22:11:39 Why is everyone looking for a rise? Oil is doing what it must naturally do right now.....fall. Those who try to delay it will fail. WTI Oil rose to the 60s on folly reasons. Now those fools will learn.

848 2018-02-13 22:08:24 What is going to happening to all the oil deposits in the future? If you hold shares in oil-producing companies, time to offload is near.
849 2018-02-13 22:08:22 All the rest can go?
850 2018-02-13 22:08:04 No, that’s the result of American sanctions against a sovereign nation that has a lot of oil. Venezuela has, according to the UN, a “Best Practise” model for its election integrity. These people want this govt by an overwhelming majority.

853 2018-02-13 22:07:58 Tell your legislator to tax oil to the top level of the law, 7%. The legislature has given reductions to every oil group like 1% for horizontal drilling. Tax the biggest welfare queen-oil companies to the max of current policy. Tax wind. This is not new law.
854 2018-02-13 22:07:49 You lie. You have yet to give me any info proving high levels of sediment in the Kalamazoo at the time of the oil spill.

Our rural residents provide the food that we eat, the cotton and energy products (ranging from wind to oil and gas and even solar farms) that we use, and of course are as important as those anywhere. We need to stand up for them instead of taking them for granted!
867 2018-02-13 22:06:30 On Tuesday, tribesmen from Balharith tribe in #Yemen oil-rich Shabwa province bombed an oil pipeline which used to transport crude from Shabwa to Marib province. FYI, all oil & gas projects in both provinces have been shut down since 2015. Long road to change mentality of tribes
868 2018-02-13 22:06:26 when the guys at the oil express place start testing my blinkers I freak out because it’s a lot to ask me to know my left from right
869 2018-02-13 22:06:25 HB 4260 (Gives oil companies the right to drill on mineral owners lands without consent) 
 
Sb270 (Will allow timber industry to cut down STATE PARK trees)  

These two bills in the WV legislation are set to demolish our wildlife and forests. It’s crazy that no one in WV cares..
870 2018-02-13 22:06:15 Gotta change the oil in the challe tomorrow. I don’t feel like getting dirty today.
871 2018-02-13 22:06:10 Does it come with oil leaks as standard or do you have to spec them?
872 2018-02-13 22:06:01 I wanna see some baby oil on that cake.
873 2018-02-13 22:05:59 Come in for oil change.

Tells me I have $500 worth of work to do on my car 
874 2018-02-13 22:05:57 Yeh but money and stuff and oil and pep and other stuff scored not the players , they were all on the bench and a ten pound note scored
875 2018-02-13 22:05:49 It's easier to change the oil and rotate treads that way.
876 2018-02-13 22:05:31 They watch CNN and believe every word they hear. They do not understand the war at hand and the temporary need to produce oil and compromise ecological concerns. They are fearful of losing abortion rights. Bought the Climate change narrative totally. Unable to process reality.sad
877 2018-02-13 22:05:28 It's not Alberta's oil, it's Canada's oil - we should all benefit. Should've been taxed a whole whack more by both levels of government and create real cash flow for us like Norway did.
878 2018-02-13 22:05:26 Absolutely.  I was being sarcastic.  RUS is making more from less, and wants to keep it going.  US might sell their oil for cheap, but OPEC+ will be ramping up prod when shale is declining, and the prices spike.
879 2018-02-13 22:05:03 swap to soy milk, dairy free butter and swap egg for oil and you have fab vegan friendly pancakes too! 
880 2018-02-13 22:04:55 You do know that 90% of english people wouldn’t miss anything but the oil, right? And further, that you don’t have the stones for taking it anyhow 
881 2018-02-13 22:04:53 Oil light has decided to flicker in car (just when braking hard). Currently 100 miles from home at class till 8:30 tonight. I really dont want to A) be stuck in Syracuse for the night or B) destroy my car trying to get home. Thanks for fucking with me universe.
882 2018-02-13 22:04:46 @brigitfilm also his marketing of coconut oil is nothing but manipulation of 'facts' for him to generate money. Coconut oil is horrific for you since it's full of sat fats, sure it's rich in MCTs but no richer in MCTs than other oils which are lower in sat fats.
883 2018-02-13 22:04:42 And marching now, the witch's midnight army

884 2018-02-13 22:04:42 My only recommendation to salvage this national dish is that the two components are at least fried in separate oil. At least then it won't all taste like a mushy compromise between seafood and starch.
885 2018-02-13 22:04:31 seriously fucking good goddamn an oil painting is worth a hundred bucks minimum by an untalented lobotomized person but whatever that’s only common knowledge you could google.
886 2018-02-13 22:04:15 Like "married to the streets," obviously!

But I would assume her spouse works in the oil and gas industry in a position where danger is moderate to high, which makes her defiantly proud.
887 2018-02-13 22:04:08 Increase in the money stock is by definition inflation. The price level then rises as a consequence. Concern about debt service is also an inflation concern. In 1999, oil was $12/bbl. There's been some money printing. #gold #oil #inflation
888 2018-02-13 22:03:54 Oil
889 2018-02-13 22:03:41 1) Cost has to drop at a faster pace than wind and (especially) solar, which is unlikely;
2) Russia has more interest in oil and natural gas than developing nuclear tech;
890 2018-02-13 22:03:37 The wholesale purchase of state and national politicians by Big Oil, Pharma, Koch Industries...

892 2018-02-13 22:03:31 Incremental improvement.  Always hard exiting a bearish sentiment.  
You look for glimmers.  
Today crude showed some life = +
Today the API #'s were relatively inline = +
Today the USD has weakened = +
IEA and OPEC OMR's out, oil still went up = +
Increased cash and Av SP's = +
893 2018-02-13 22:03:30 Yes , looking for weapons of mass destruction? Oil was the reason!
894 2018-02-13 22:03:29 i need some tea tree oil, anybody got some 
895 2018-02-13 22:03:26 No! Diet Mt Dew has vegetable oil in it. Seriously. It's like drinking Crisco.

902 2018-02-13 22:02:42 Okurrrr! My oil change was free!? What???
903 2018-02-13 22:02:38 Canada will also add to non-OPEC output in significant way in 2018 with ~400,000 b/d year-on-year additions expected.  Hebron, Fort  Hills, Horizon, growing western Canadian tight oil, and others all contributing to the rise.
904 2018-02-13 22:02:30 Last time I heard, around 70 nationwide. 
This is deadliest county in the country? 
Serious for sure, 70 deaths, maybe, in country  320 mil
905 2018-02-13 22:02:11 It’s really clear that the Oil need scoring depth on the roster. So I looked at goal and shooting percentage stats to look for somewhat realistic targets Edmonton could acquire:

- Gallagher
- Simmonds
- Hoffman 
- Grabner
- Byron
- Athanasiou
- Brett Connolly
- Vanek
906 2018-02-13 22:02:09 Yea your right was thinking it was like a Aussie mac kid seen at a truck show which had one on each side one was an oil breather/cooler
907 2018-02-13 22:01:57 Au contraire. In the real world markets rightly differentiate between grades or coal and oil that are high in natural impurities espy sulfur and those that are naturally low in impurities or have been processed to lower them. But of course in the eco world there is no such logic.
908 2018-02-13 22:01:34 #Alberta — Spill wine, not oil.
909 2018-02-13 22:01:24 I want onion rings. Can I use olive oil to fry them??? Cuz it’s the only oil I have.
910 2018-02-13 22:01:22 #KeepCanadaWorking.  If we're going to kill the Alberta oil industry then we should also end all equalization payments from Alberta to the rest of Canada immediately.  Since Ontario needs equalization payments, we need oil and hence pipelines.
911 2018-02-13 22:01:18 Ah, Norway.  Offshore drilling, underwater pipelines, tanker traffic, oil exports, money in the bank.....

920 2018-02-13 22:00:12 I’ve been playing Russian Roulette with the “low oil” light for weeks
921 2018-02-13 22:00:09 Wow where do you live that oil is that cheap?! Seriously, when I was getting by on $15/wk for food, I found oil was one of the more expensive items out there. Twice that at a minimum.
922 2018-02-13 22:00:08 February 13, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

924 2018-02-13 22:00:06 Soap is very good at adhering to oil and dirt and letting it be rinsed away.  Your skin needs oil!  A lot of face washes don't actually have conventional detergents/soaps, because your face is most sensitive to a loss of skin oil.
925 2018-02-13 22:00:05 Doesn't really jive with national numbers. Half of deaths in 1 county? Also not downplaying, but country has 320 million +
926 2018-02-13 21:59:44 Yeah, coconut oil is really not the move for your face.
927 2018-02-13 21:59:31 getting extreme satisfaction from the fact that i'm about to get my oil changed before the dude who tried to cut me in line. the first feel i've had all day!

929 2018-02-13 21:59:13 If/when mice return, buy Peppermint Essential Oil and (a) place cotton balls in strategic spots in rooms, or (b) mix w/Castile soap/water in glass spray bottle & spray liberally about the kitchen. The mint works. I know.

931 2018-02-13 21:59:07 @simonrim Thanks so much for the 'ultimate' pancake recipe. They were lovely and thin with crispy edges. Didn't even need to oil the pan. Hoped to keep some for stuffing tomorrow, but we ate them all!
932 2018-02-13 21:58:39 Hair smothered in coconut oil and it smells like baked goods, if that isn’t torture I dunno what is 
933 2018-02-13 21:58:27 @Shine_Danielle hello, your advice please, you suggested using sweet almond oil and castor oil to put on lashes to condition. On both bottles I bought advice is to keep away from eyes. I know Iput on with a wand, but just wanted to check ok to use. Many txs in advance
934 2018-02-13 21:58:26 Hmm, not sure I could eat something fried in Lard.  Mom cooked with lard most of my childhood,. But when she switched to Wesson Oil; I stopped having tummy aches.
935 2018-02-13 21:58:20 Don't forget all the offshore installations like wind farms, oil rigs, gas platforms, undersea pipes and cables that are vulnerable
936 2018-02-13 21:58:18 Fossil fuel has 30 years and it's over.
Convinced a few retired friends into electric cars. Win-win. No stopping for gas. No need for oil, anti-freeze changes. Now looking into solar power to offset rise in electric bill. They rent a gas car if going on extended trips..4 now.

938 2018-02-13 21:57:44 bih. I just washed my hair & put that hair oil I got from @TheNiaHope on.. why my scalp feel like it’s at the spa on a PTO day
939 2018-02-13 21:57:18 When boiling the pasta, i put a splash of Trader Joe's garlic olive oil in the water, after boiling, you could probably put a splash of it in the pasta while cooking it as well as the potatoes.. Trader Joe's also has a season salt called 21 Seasons that goes good on anything..
940 2018-02-13 21:57:17 LOL, that is hilarious coming from a sniveling conservative whiner. Also, @CPC_HQ, @jkenney, and #UCP calling environmentalists fascists just proves they cannot stand opposition to them putting oil money over people. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #StopKinderMoragn #NoPipelines

944 2018-02-13 21:56:34 Technology and long distance relationships are like water and oil 
945 2018-02-13 21:56:17 Let go down this road, lets say we start overturning legal elections based on personality. I thought many of the same things about Obama and Clinton, the only difference ts they were better at selling their brand of snake oil. Great con men are very charming, its how they win.
946 2018-02-13 21:56:00 I raised the severance tax in Ohio to 6.5% to hinder the use of our earth's resources like oil. Yes, Big oil may disagree and try to bribe, but I will never let my firm stance on protecting the environment change. #malcolmgov
947 2018-02-13 21:55:56 I get so angry at these globalists preferring oil from another country that I have to stop reading the crap till my anger subsides.
948 2018-02-13 21:55:52 They've got less salt & oil/fats involved which is I think why I feel better when I eat them? Fair warning tho some of the chips are VERY hard when you bite into them if they weren't cut thin enough.
949 2018-02-13 21:55:32 @NARSCosmetics can I ask if your *amazing* new longwear foundation is oil free? Thanks so much 
950 2018-02-13 21:55:23 Because we don’t access to tidewater like we should we are selling oil at half the WTI price which in turn loses the Canadian economy billions every year.  It’s more than just jobs.

956 2018-02-13 21:54:31 I cheat and use a pancake mix where I only add eggs oil and milk 
957 2018-02-13 21:54:29 I have. Their products are aces. Their coconut oil in particular is the best I've used, someone almost always steals it from me. Their website isn't that's great though, so you might have to look through all the pages to find what you want.
958 2018-02-13 21:54:25 If you focus more on plant fats like nuts, avocados, coconut oil and follow the diet in a way that keeps everything in check, then you would eliminate the risk. Sure, if you're filling up with animal fat and not eating foods to counteract the effects, yes, that's dangerous.
959 2018-02-13 21:54:24 For me personally when I was using it for my stretch marks it took roughly two-three weeks using the oil twice a day  but then it’s depending on yourself really!
960 2018-02-13 21:54:07 Their ability to do that comes from oil and gas income, similar to Norway.
961 2018-02-13 21:54:01 Agree. And today, while we talk about a security clearance (important, but...) Dreamers are being shipped off to a strange country and our land is being sold for oil companies (which will eventually also kill people).

966 2018-02-13 21:53:03 the opioid companies will pay for their crimes, and so too the oil and tobacco companies.
967 2018-02-13 21:52:54 A Warner presidency would involve cost effective and proven policies that would benefit the environment such as incorporating clean energy and to make us less dependent on oil. Yes that's right. Less dependent on oil. @DatStateFloRida #malcolmgov
968 2018-02-13 21:52:44 Realistically the tax hasn't been raised in decades. Fuel efficiency has reduced per vehicle consumption . A raise is in order.

970 2018-02-13 21:51:36 Yeah that shocked me about Houston when I lived there. Guess the oil and gas execs want more people driving than taking public transportation.
971 2018-02-13 21:51:31 Oh please tell me it was Donny( little punk ) Jr...please , please...oh wait, the lions wouldn't have eaten him, way too much oil in that hair of his( or should we call it mousse?)
972 2018-02-13 21:51:23 They relive their lives from (often) happy memories - filling the space left; pushing out logic & short term memory. Coconut oil has proven a great way to at least slow the tide, but ye have to get it in them (spoonful/day).
973 2018-02-13 21:51:16 I'm for a strong federal government over strong provincial governments. I don't think geography should dictate wealth of Canadians. There is still no excuse for Alberta not having the same cash that Norway has. And once oil $ dropped they wanted help #awkward

982 2018-02-13 21:49:50 I think I used the wrong oil. I used cooking oil, I usually use a little butter mixed in groundnut. Batter too thick. Couldn't be arsed really.

987 2018-02-13 21:49:27 Dropped $700 on new tires, an oil change, & getting the car inspected... the price made me cringe but I’m just so relieved!!! Adulting isn’t all that bad I guess now time to start saving for other things
988 2018-02-13 21:49:23 I guess oil didn't go to $80 after all
989 2018-02-13 21:49:22 Some people crave chocolate as a snack, others crave chips. I crave bread with olive oil/herb dipping sauce. #ImWeird

991 2018-02-13 21:48:54 The only way that Big Oil maintains astronomical profit margins is to cheat and bribe and falsify and lie. Politicians grow more rich by accepting bribes, known add lobbying money, and favors and influence. This is how unchecked democracy works. The true hurts politicians.

1013 2018-02-13 21:45:29 We are in the process of trying a few things. But starting one at a time just to see what’s effective. Right now we are starting by incorporating coconut oil.

1019 2018-02-13 21:44:26 What utopia is this. 10% unemployment is still 10%. Having power cuts because of the oil crisis & collapsing economy still happened. Threat of constant nuclear armageden was not fun. Bin strikes leaving piles of rubbish; gravedigger - backlog of burials.  You weren't there man.
1020 2018-02-13 21:44:21 Yes, the air pockets, but oil is your key. Change the oil type and distribution to see the changes. A dry pan gives you almost uniform brown. A good oiling with butter gives you a best mottled effect. A dry pan that’s just a little too hot too, burns bubble nodes like image 2.
1021 2018-02-13 21:44:21 anyone see know the differences between CBS oil and CBDplus oil soft gels?  have people tried them and had positive results?

1036 2018-02-13 21:42:14 They need money to rebuild Mosul. Money can come from these projects. Simplistic thinking. As usual, Basra's oil will foot the Mosul bill. Until another trend of insurgency emerges then Basra's oil has fund exterminating it. All while Basrawis live in slums.

1050 2018-02-13 21:40:54 Russia surpassed the war on terror, to the game of oil / gas and geopolitical war even if necessary to destroy the original components of the Syrian north.
Russia must recognize the fact that there are genuine and important Syrian forces that are allied to the United States
1051 2018-02-13 21:40:53 Honey, I don't know where you're shopping, but where I live you would only get those prices at 99c store or Dollar General. Maybe. At a regular grocery store, cake mix is closer to $3, oil at a minimum is $2 and eggs from $2.50 up.
1052 2018-02-13 21:40:46 That's what I mean. Alberta should have a surplus but Conservatives blew it buying into the fact they actually thought the oil companies wouldn't invest if they actually taxed them properly. Another win for big oil

1133 2018-02-13 21:33:19 I met a Australian geologist from the oil & gas industry last week. After the conversation got round to global warming he refused to speak to me any more. But even he didn't claim that coal would make a comeback.

1146 2018-02-13 21:32:10 This #BlueApronBox thing isn't new. In the 1960's my dad's church was a distro center for government commodities.

1180 2018-02-13 21:28:39 Gubmint peanut butter was the worst peanut butter imaginable - half a jar of oil, and half a jar of peanut particles. We would pour the oil out and eat the peanut butter. In retrospect, we should have saved the oil for cooking.

1191 2018-02-13 21:27:29 What owning an EV is like: 
Haha you still cause emissions cause you use electricity!

So your car doesn't emit anything, and only uses gas and oil that take no energy to harvest or refine? That's great! What kind of gas and oil is this?
1192 2018-02-13 21:27:29 I just ordered the Four Vices oil and mustache wax. I’m looking forward to using them. Thanks!

1197 2018-02-13 21:27:10 You want to get really enraged?  Watch the W Virginia woman call out reps for accepting oil money and getting hustled out. 
1198 2018-02-13 21:26:59 I disagree - It's cheap because it's grown in an area rife with corruption and poverty with little regulation or oversight. And it simply cannot be high-yield enough to justify the ecological devastation it causes - 90% of orangutan habit has already been cleared for palm oil.
1199 2018-02-13 21:26:55 
1200 2018-02-13 21:26:46 And the Nathan Stewart tug that sank spilled diesel not oil. 
Btw, diesel is much harder to clean up than diluted bitumen. Dilbit floats in saltwater. Diesel doesn't. 
So, that post has nothing to do with my statement either.

1216 2018-02-13 21:24:26 BMW: 4 tires will cost your right arm, oil change will be the portion of your soul not sold to the devil, spark plugs/oxygen sensors will most definitely be your first born and all descendants, and of course this would be cut in half were in not for labor charges.

1217 2018-02-13 21:24:24 Incentivizing the production of domestic oil and gas lowers the price and hurts the Russians more than sanctions Ms. Lane.

1221 2018-02-13 21:23:53 Why was a Russian tanker in Boston with a gas or oil shipment? Are sanctions meaningless?
1222 2018-02-13 21:23:33 Yeah I have worked minimum wage jobs. I also pay student loans I took to educate myself. Do what you need to do to support your family. Dropping fries in oil isn’t worth $15 an hour.  Sorry.
1223 2018-02-13 21:23:29 Last time I checked the pipeline strike in Burnaby was on land. So not an oil tanker. Was a guy in a excavator without a spotter. So this has nothing to do with my statement.
1224 2018-02-13 21:23:23 My dad paid for my oil change, best valentine ever 
1225 2018-02-13 21:23:13 And ginger tea and/or castor oil
1226 2018-02-13 21:23:03 Saudi Arabia is one of the worst actors in the region and want to destroy Shia Islam. They spread Wahhabism to stay in power. America backs the Saudis because they have the cheapest oil extraction costs. What they’re doing in Yemen is an atrocity.

1231 2018-02-13 21:22:43 @MissGeorgiakx try using a lotion that is more of a milk than oil or cream as these tend to block pores hence skin cannot breathe = prickly heat whereas a sun milk will not block the pores - good luck ambre Solair do a great sun milk xx

1235 2018-02-13 21:22:08 Masturbating umm...
I make enough that I haven't needed lube for that in a long while

But otherwise I almost always suggest the same things. J-lube for cheap toy play, oil when it's possible and you don't mind more cleanup, silicone for stuff with another person, etc
1236 2018-02-13 21:22:05 Where is the oil money to rip this brilliant spurs side apart? That’ll be the real beauty of football.

1238 2018-02-13 21:22:03 @karinbbc what an idiot Joe Miller - thinks downwards pressure on oil prices is a bad thing.
1239 2018-02-13 21:21:49 Erm , shall we say their prices weren’t very competitive . For retail , there is a lot more competition than there was a few years back with Harvest / Essar / Certas / Greenergy in the market - their fuels division earns from kero/oil now
1240 2018-02-13 21:21:42 Allen can have mine it might rain in from doors and do a litre of oil per 2 tanks of fuel but least it gets me to jobs haha

1244 2018-02-13 21:21:05 Example, oil companies will be nationalized in the interest of the “homeland.” U own oil stock? Disney? Who is going to Disneyland or take a cruise in the middle of WW III?

1246 2018-02-13 21:20:58 Trump has no other cards in the deck, and is driving a car that hasn't had an oil change in 9000 miles.  Without Bannon he is going to have to take on a Mitch McConnell guy, and I think the GOP is terrified of giving up a senator after Alabama.

1262 2018-02-13 21:19:12 Well, palm is partly cheap because it yields oil more per acre than other crops.
1263 2018-02-13 21:19:11 The joke is this, if history repeats itself... the oil barons, market investors and CEO’s that aren’t fighting for democracy against GOP will lose everything. Look at Germany after Hitler’s rise. Example, oil companies...
1264 2018-02-13 21:19:00 Yea. No more chips, cookies, ice cream and tiny overpriced fruit juice boxes that don't contain fruit juice.
1265 2018-02-13 21:18:59 Get ready for me to talk about #CBD oil I've been trying. 
I've had pretty awful anxiety for my whole life. I actually didn't realize it wasn't normal until about a year ago when some of my roommates told me that it isn't normal for a child to be in a state panic all the time.
1266 2018-02-13 21:18:54 You go girl! Though I'm in Arizona I wish you all the luck in the world to defeat big oil in WV!!
1267 2018-02-13 21:18:53 Gun Oil and KY are the only two I've ever used. (Astroglide doesn't exist to me anymore!!!) I don't use lube very much when masturbating, and I don't own any toys.....yet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1268 2018-02-13 21:18:47 OMG SO TRUE
1269 2018-02-13 21:18:22 My yoga teacher put herbal oil on my own and one other person's forehead when everyone had their eyes shut in shavasana and now I'm not sure if I'm been initiated into a yoga cult.
1270 2018-02-13 21:18:17 Sadly. I had an oil change done some time ago and the guy didn’t know how it worked.
1271 2018-02-13 21:18:14 oh wow, so refreshing! having a romaine, cucumber, and green onion salad that I dressed with lemon, olive oil, salt, pepper, and fresh dill. Sometimes just working with what you already have in the fridge pays off 
1272 2018-02-13 21:18:14 WHY is it so hard to set an apt for an oil change at Kia???? 
1273 2018-02-13 21:18:13 Celebrating #MahaShivaratri on #ValentinesDay by burning the midnight oil at work. Such is life.
1274 2018-02-13 21:18:13 Burning the midnight oil. Watching an episode of Suits after this will be a great treat 
1275 2018-02-13 21:18:04 I’m getting a oil change and it’s 3 mfs looking under my hood they better not be on no shit cause ain’t shit wrong with my car lmao
1276 2018-02-13 21:17:46 ME ONLY WANT FLOWERS THAT SMELL LIKE WHISKY, GUNPOWDER AND BACON. AGGGH. ME MAN. ME ONLY LIKE FLOWERS THAT ARE CHROMED AND OIL SOAKED.
1277 2018-02-13 21:17:28 Really???? Lol there is not one oil tanker on the government Web site. So ..Ummmm. .... Ya.  
4 trucks, a tug and a barge. So what you have posted is proof that you can't tell the difference between what is and isn't a oil tanker.
1278 2018-02-13 21:17:24 because im taking my makeup off with coconut oil?
1279 2018-02-13 21:17:21 Whats the difference between clean energyand oil?

Liberals believe clean energy is actually clean

#cleanenergy #educateliberals
1280 2018-02-13 21:17:15 I believe there was some feeling that the Iraq war was going to pay for itself via onlining oil and natural gas.  I believe people saw the price increase and the eventual market collapse as a betrayal.
1281 2018-02-13 21:17:15 That’s true, and it’s extremely hard to raise taxes on O&G. They have our R Representatives bought out. I’m down for a plan that raises O&G back to ORIGINAL 7% #GPT and the taxes on Oklahomans. A plan like that would work if Rs gave up the big oil money.
1282 2018-02-13 21:16:46 All I see is the pres cutting things for the common people, where are the cuts to money given to big business, tobacco, oil & gas, insurance companies, real estate, Wall Street, etc.  All we hear is more lies and deceit, all he care about is himself. SO SAD!
1283 2018-02-13 21:16:41 I avoid palm oil too. Hate that it's so common.

1287 2018-02-13 21:15:51 Gun Oil is so slick and thin and not sticky at all. Plus, it lasts a good while~
1288 2018-02-13 21:15:49 I just bought new rosehip oil for 11$ JUST YESTERDAY and half of it just fucking SPILLED ALL OVER MY DESK. I'm going to strangle the next thing that ruins my day I'm so done
1289 2018-02-13 21:15:47 Non-essential oils – diesel, petrol, crude oil. #ElectricVehicles for Galway. And a light rail system while we're at it.
1290 2018-02-13 21:15:44 #PancakeTuesday 
the first one is always a bit dodgy  
I use too much oil  
Flipping them is all in the wrist - I still messed up several times  
I’m full, fat & satisfied now 
1291 2018-02-13 21:15:40 I know! Trump has been killing Putin, as you note, in Syria & Ukraine. Also what happens in Iran. Look at the oil situation, we're now a net exporter. Putin's economy is heavily dependent on their oil revenue.
Oops, looks like Putin made a mistake putting Trump in office, lol
1292 2018-02-13 21:15:07 I've heard such good things about buckwheat - must try to cook with it again. I've heard such horrible stories about palm oil and the destruction caused. It doesn't seem to get much of a mention unless something comes up in the news cycle.
1293 2018-02-13 21:14:56 I can check for a clogged oil line. I don't have an area for repairs that require engine removal, though.
1294 2018-02-13 21:14:43 For any females trying to grow their eyebrows out, two words... castor oil 
1295 2018-02-13 21:14:38 I do pretty much the same, sometimes have the oil, sometimes add an extra yolk. Lemon and sugar for pancake day. American pancakes etc. for the rest of the year.
1296 2018-02-13 21:14:35 When your at the car lot getting your oil changed in your car. And you look out in the lot and theirs a jeep 
1297 2018-02-13 21:14:24 I’ve been waiting for an oil change for 3 hours..
1298 2018-02-13 21:14:20 You mean say GEJ wey get 3 times income from oil more than Buhari no fit revive the economy? The figure don't lie. Our  Foreign reserve is close to $41 Billion, whereas the thing dey go down under the hero. If anyone is being deceived, it is yourself.
1299 2018-02-13 21:14:13 I've heard good things about Gun Oil. Definitely give Pjur a shot. I'm not sure if you can get it in stores but Amazon sells it. I'd talk to Riley about that powdered stuff too.
1300 2018-02-13 21:14:12 Delia is wrong on butter. SF oil is best to get high temperature and crisp. I use all milk (no water) and less liquid than Delia says

1304 2018-02-13 21:13:49 @CNN @MSNBC Yes! Porter’s a bad guy but how about all the departments getting gutted by this admin?!!! We are losing the State Department! The EPA is allowing oil and gas to desttoy our parks!!!WTF?!!
1305 2018-02-13 21:13:48 When I was working in the oil fields ... most of the guys were in their 40's / 50's. They grew up in Jim Crow. So some of it was pure ignorance. Some of it pure racism. In the end ... I wrote a lot of it off as generational. But now I see young people spewing this bigoted BS...
1306 2018-02-13 21:13:48 yes Synthetic 5W-20 Common sense it takes the heat and detergent in the oil keeps the gun clean even under severe use Range master was 1 who sold me works like a champ even in my Tavor

1308 2018-02-13 21:13:32 Michelle Obama proposed this, there would be a waiting list.
1309 2018-02-13 21:13:30 I want to fry some chicken but I don't like that heavy oil smell that lingers afterwards.

1314 2018-02-13 21:13:07 I have an essential oil blend with lavender spray (1 for my face & 1 for my pillow/room) that's designed to help soothe you to sleep, also a magnesium oil to massage onto my skin which help relax muscles; a blackout curtaib & talk radio; herbal sleep blend teas occasionally too!
1315 2018-02-13 21:13:07 Selling a fixed asset to a foreign owner  represents min. risk and that could be confiscated just by ignoring it does not seem to be very serious concern.  On the other hand, using someone else's money to provide a service (who made that money by selling oil to the US)?

1317 2018-02-13 21:12:57 @BlueMtnState @alanritchson @THEEdarinbrooks @iamromanski @edmarinaro radio advertisement for free oil chang. No thanks!
1318 2018-02-13 21:12:51 Futures curve for oil and gas is in backwardation right now I believe, so no rolling cost. But since speculative positioning is at extreme levels right now for oil I would stay away from it
1319 2018-02-13 21:12:46 castor oil cleared my skin up so fast 
1320 2018-02-13 21:12:39 cause usually the GF foods that kinda taste okay have a lot of fat/sugar.  I also find a lot have palm oil, which I won't eat.
1321 2018-02-13 21:12:37 Silicone lubricant for fun times is great, but as you said not so good with toys. For those, oil is better if the product allows (BD is fine with it). My standby of j-lube works pretty well for a water-based lube if mixed well enough but I prefer premade for being spontaneous
1322 2018-02-13 21:12:29 Straight on the grill, seasoned first of course! It looks really charred but it’s only really the very edge of each leaf that’s blackened. It’s great with anchovy oil or butter, by the way.
1323 2018-02-13 21:12:20 You mean like the Standard Oil Building and Sears Tower? But then I sometimes slip and refer to the Congress Street Expressway, a/k/a the Eisenhower for those <60yoa.
1324 2018-02-13 21:11:54 Same! I've been using Gun Oil ever since an ex once bought it. Wanted to try new things, like KY and all that. I might just use this Astroglide in the shower to get rid of it.
1325 2018-02-13 21:11:53 Never had mine out (wish I had, they pushed my front ones together and gave me the Ken Dodd gnashers you see today), but when they were sore, the only thing that worked was clove oil. It tastes rank and it’ll make you gip but it just numbs everything.
1326 2018-02-13 21:11:49 My hair always looks good tough thanks to my stylist and my weekly appointments.  She applies my prescription oil every week,
1327 2018-02-13 21:11:48 You really hate taxes on oil don't you Jason?

1329 2018-02-13 21:11:30 Used a little drop of olbas oil last night to clear my sinuses and came into bedroom this evening and the room is humming of it. So strong that it's making my eyes water.

1332 2018-02-13 21:11:09 Ohio, but I lived in Houston , Texas (Tejas now) for many years during my Days working in the oil sector.
1333 2018-02-13 21:11:04 I used butter but it burned so I switched to sunflower oil
1334 2018-02-13 21:10:53 Engine oil to wank
1335 2018-02-13 21:10:49 Spritz with water or use water on hands if need to refresh curl. Occasional hair oil can help ends - sparingly or your pillows will hate you
1336 2018-02-13 21:10:31 "Salad" is derived from the Latin word "Sal" for salt.  This is because salads originated in the Greco-Roman era in which greens were served with an oil & salt dressing. People invented similar dishes. Salad evolved into any irregular mixture or Hodgepodge.  E.g. Word salad.
1337 2018-02-13 21:10:30 見回り行ってきまーす！
1338 2018-02-13 21:10:29 That's definitely legal I mean the suspect is helping you by giving you an oil change. Amazing brotha. Lmao.

1345 2018-02-13 21:09:45 tell ya another thing we got away from traditional gun lubrication  replaced them with 5W-20 synthetic oil WHAT a difference I had to train within a 250 round maximum engaging targets & after the drill the pistol was virtually clean
1346 2018-02-13 21:09:39 We REALLY need to look at Norway's subsidizing of their oil industry. They're never going to run out of oil money because of it, even long after the oil is dried up.
1347 2018-02-13 21:09:39 Shale oil piek zal niet lang duren
1348 2018-02-13 21:09:38 Maybe it's also the planets way of getting rid of us we suck up all the natural resources destroy everything in our path in the name of money. NASA landed a robot on an astroid don't tell me the Technology is not there to have a clean economy but then you would lose oil revenue
1349 2018-02-13 21:09:35 Every kid I see, I encourage them to look into plumbing, HVAC, welding, electrician, even chimney sweep. There's a ton of money out there, all it takes is a willingness to work and get certified. And NO student debt.
1350 2018-02-13 21:09:35 Rather, I repeat myself because you keep ignoring my point and .... sliding on. Do you think I'm going to let you do that? No, I'm not. Libertarians CANNOT be racists. Racists CANNOT be libertarians. One is oil, and the other water. One collectivist, the other individualist.
1351 2018-02-13 21:09:28 Dermatologist said I can't do much about my scalp problem.  That it's incurable & I can only manage it.  I guess I won't be getting my hair locked (maybe faux locks again) or wearing it natural every day.  I'll continue to flatiron it & apply my oil.  Still things I can do w/ it.
1352 2018-02-13 21:09:22 Time to add olive tress and oil to the list. They can do well in the county per the weather.

1354 2018-02-13 21:09:15 Ditto with my tech school
1355 2018-02-13 21:09:10 Is Butts really this stupid? Norway has a budget surplus and a trillion dollar cash fund. They also only has 5 million people and is the only country with a significant oil industry in the EU.
1356 2018-02-13 21:09:03 I'm down!
Or you can save some bucks, roast one for an hour (cut in half, flat side down, no oil/salt) and voila! 
Nothing satisfies like gourd season lol
1357 2018-02-13 21:09:03 I had a coworker at a Borders superstore who was so allergic to peanuts that we couldn't bring baked goods with anything associated peanuts (including oil). Those stores weren't small - it's not like she had to even be close to it.

1362 2018-02-13 21:07:57 How does a gym smell like concentrated olive oil
1363 2018-02-13 21:07:47 Suggest you enact a “contingency act” that taxes oil destined to BC consignees “in event BC restricts Trans Mtn capacity”.  Then, it’s all BC’s fault since the act only takes effect if they harm us -/ but otherwise does nothing.
1364 2018-02-13 21:07:46 Hi John. I have a car that uses fossil fuel and electricity. I ride my bike to work, towing one kid and shepherding another through traffic to school. I sometimes get oil on my hands when changing lubricant for the car engine. Doesn't change climate science evidence of warming :)

1368 2018-02-13 21:07:16 What sets Mason Co’s popcorn above all others is that it’s a little bit oily. Too many places popcorn is just dry and salty. Mason Co you get that flavor and that extra oil.

1376 2018-02-13 21:06:24 Some basic foods are made in the same areas as foods that use peanut oil, which people have allergies to. Some also have milk proteins used to prepare them. How do you extract those types of things?

1390 2018-02-13 21:03:39  Italian Cuisine - Traditionally it was possible to distinguish Italian cooking simply by the type of cooking fat used: butter was used in the north, pork fat in the center of the country, and olive oil in the south #CupcakeHour
1391 2018-02-13 21:03:39 Seeing lots of avid flu shot supporters still getting the flu. Seeing lots of avid natyralists/Essential Oil/elderberry/kambucha users getting the flu. My point? Well I don't really know. But I don't want the flu.
1392 2018-02-13 21:03:37 You could easily combine butter with a high smoke point grape seed oil.

1394 2018-02-13 21:03:22 Barriers exist in many Industries, it's what people do to get around those barriers. Imagine the barriers there are to the oil industry and the cost!? Take fracking for instance, what does it cost to bring the product to the surface? There are ways around most things

1399 2018-02-13 21:02:57 I never realized how much I use coconut oil every day
1400 2018-02-13 21:02:49 Of course the fact that @OwenJones84 quotes the elected Hugo Chavez who has been dead since 2013 seems a minor detail for you. Also the economic decline was deal to the decline of the oil price
1401 2018-02-13 21:02:40 So?  He didn't take it from Big Pharma or GE or Big Oil.  He is indebted to his family, just like all family members.
1402 2018-02-13 21:02:23 Like an oil change should take 10 min max

1410 2018-02-13 21:01:14 We have a winner for our Bundle of Joy contest! Come back Thursday to find out who. They've won a month of unlimited car washes, $50.00 to spend at the Depot Street Tavern, and a free oil change!

1412 2018-02-13 21:00:47 Thanks to @DiezelRaccoon for keeping an eye on my tire overnight. Seems to be fine though. I'll keep an eye on it through the week. Though I think my wheel alignment is a bit off. So have an appointment Friday to get my oil changed and look at the alignment.
1413 2018-02-13 21:00:40 How do you even properly photograph a finished oil painting with all this gloss shining back at no matter what angle you take a picture from ...

1417 2018-02-13 21:00:30 James Dines once said: "Don't think, look!". When you look at oil, what do you see? When you look at bonds, what do you see? I know what I see. I gave up trading my opinion and rather started to trade on what the market tells me.
1418 2018-02-13 21:00:30 WHAT?!? He is exporting Gas and Oil to Europe which is Russia's biggest market for their natural gas and oil exports are you drunk? This hurts Russia's economy!He is promoting solar not sabotaging. You're way to dumb to debate I need to block you now to get you to STFU
1419 2018-02-13 21:00:28 The Kochs' businesses include all kinds of services for the oil & gas industries. They have contracts with Russian oil industry companies.
1420 2018-02-13 21:00:23 Yeah, the permanent aggression against Venezuela promoted by the US has nothing to do with it! No, the US does not want to steal oil from Venezuela! No one can think that!

1423 2018-02-13 21:00:15 Why are they shipping overseas then? Who built the US refineries and why were they built in the US? Alberta should have made sure that if foreign oil was going to dig up the tar sands that refineries were built there. This should have been done years ago. Makes no sense.
1424 2018-02-13 21:00:14 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
1425 2018-02-13 21:00:11 Lmk if ya need some dinner spots if ya wanna be formal before the Oil change
1426 2018-02-13 21:00:09 The guys that changed my oil thought They’d play a cute game called “let’s not put all the screws back” so when i went over a speed bump the bottom of my car came half way off :))))))
1427 2018-02-13 21:00:08 Oil is fine as long as you're not using it again and again. Use coconut oil as it's great but get ready to smell like a Spanish holiday

1430 2018-02-13 20:59:59 The flames felt sorry for the oil and gifted them a couple games in return the oilers will cheer on the flames in the playoffs
1431 2018-02-13 20:59:55 I just wanna thank castor oil for making my brows look so good 
1432 2018-02-13 20:59:38 Is someone trying to get revenge or something cause every time I get an oil change they find nails in my tires so lemme know
1433 2018-02-13 20:59:38 1. Basically full, my skin sucks
2. Ikr? It’s super watery I appreciate the Argan oil but still
3. It doesn’t matter since I’ve already dropped about $50 on foundation before
4. I still don’t know, I’d say a little dry and acne-prone
1434 2018-02-13 20:59:34 I think so. Cuba used to get its oil from Venezuela.  When it collapsed, the Russians stepped in & started delivering it since last May. Putin won't put up w Trump forever.  May become another Cuban Missile Crisis. Hope those sanctions go thru.
1435 2018-02-13 20:59:19 However, I will say if u wear cologne, stop buying alcohol-based products! Go oil based! It’s more expensive but way better for your skin and the environment.
1436 2018-02-13 20:59:16 Before you dye it put coconut oil for like a day, do you want semi permanent or permanent, do you know how your hair takes dyes ?
1437 2018-02-13 20:59:11 Horton's was a unique case. They couldn't insure it in yr 1 & intended on doing so in yr 2 iirc. But he got hurt in yr 1.
1438 2018-02-13 20:59:09 “Relatable.” For many years, and even years to come, people would be quick to assume that she arrived in new, exotic places to take over a section of their land for extracting oil. But judgement ruled, honesty didn’t. “Still wanting to prove your point, I see?”

1442 2018-02-13 20:59:01 Just touched the top of Emmy’s head and started to freak out that she was sweating a ton but then I remembered I rubbed coconut oil all over her head like 15 minutes ago. 
1443 2018-02-13 20:58:53 As “Oil” is not a commodity. The oil price in capitalism has always been & will be fixed by the oil cartels  @CNBC @tdichristopher @IEA
1444 2018-02-13 20:58:49 Irony of course is that BC letting US coal through it's ports! Even more irony - Christy Clark (who just bashed Horgan on oil) was the one who said that's not ok!
1445 2018-02-13 20:58:36 Trump has refused to implement sanctions.  He's sabotaging Solar to make a greater mkt for gas and oil which helps Russia. He is alienating our allies which is what Russia wants.
1446 2018-02-13 20:58:21 Oil tank things? Under the cab? They're the fuel tanks.
1447 2018-02-13 20:58:21 #Exxon is so convinced that burning all the #oil in the world has no influence on the #climate that it feels confident in suing even the lawyers of the people who are suing it.
#Exxon does not believe in #science. Every #scientist who works there should resign or go on strike.
1448 2018-02-13 20:58:11 Nice! Where did you find this oil you speak of?
1449 2018-02-13 20:57:55 More troubling than his views, idiots everywhere, is that 13,000 ppl are like minded and find him insightful.

1452 2018-02-13 20:57:39 Can you please spend your $ on renewable energy, which would not only help the planet, but also defund oil oligarchs that are destabilizing our democracies?
1453 2018-02-13 20:57:31 They did this in California in the early until 1973. The box contained a big can of boneless chicken, huge hunk of velveeta style cheese, A pound of flour, 2# of pinto beans and can of cooking oil. The chicken was uneatable. The only thing to do with the rest was to make burritos
1454 2018-02-13 20:57:27 Are you vegan purely for weight loss purposes? I always thought it was worse than being vegetarian because so the recipes I've seen all use so much oil! I must be looking in the wrong places!

1457 2018-02-13 20:57:10 Your wineries DON’T. Like it or not, Oil is a necessity and wine is a luxury. Deal with it
1458 2018-02-13 20:57:03 Wouldn't it separate though like water and oil? Water and oil sounds more appetising
1459 2018-02-13 20:57:01 Literally going to have a mental breakdown over this hour long oil change.
1460 2018-02-13 20:56:35 Just took the worst shower ever... 
1. Tea tree oil shampoo in my eyes 
2. Water turned cold half way through 
3. I hit my funny bone on the door 
4. Has to walk to the laundry room ass naked to get a towel

1462 2018-02-13 20:56:28 Attempted the @rodialbeauty Dragons Blood lip mask... really?  Absolutely useless crap! Like painting 300 gallons of oil on your lips. Gross
1463 2018-02-13 20:56:28 There r many carbon credits lost in that transaction. Shipping costs will only go down when they use sail not oil! Time carbon tax put reality back in costs!
1464 2018-02-13 20:56:24 Aargh. Haven't synched my laptop (with pics) and my tablet yet! Look at FB Eats Roots and Leaves salads.
1465 2018-02-13 20:56:19 Lavender oil works for me too. I’ve just bought a diffuser for the kids bedroom. We are all sleeping so much better. No screens before bed - easier said than done though! #blurtchats
1466 2018-02-13 20:56:13 My secret = Sriracha, Olive oil, a little Dijon, pepper. Makes a nice dressing
1467 2018-02-13 20:56:05 Oh lol so they consider oil revenue temporary then Norway has a huge hole, I see. "Notveryusefuldata"
1468 2018-02-13 20:55:50 I have at least 1 cuticle oil and 1 nail cream. There's probably more. I'm gonna have to dump them all in my bag

#Unilever ended its purchase of palm oil due to allegations of complicity with deforestation and child labor.
At least they are seeking the moral high ground, unlike ...
1478 2018-02-13 20:54:31 PM Trudeau once said he wanted to "phase out" the oil sands - nothing has changed. The federal Liberals will never really stand up for Alberta's energy sector, and they won't stand with Alberta when we really need it. I'm disappointed, but not surprised.
1479 2018-02-13 20:54:05 Add one hundred grams of olive oil and allow to simmer.
1480 2018-02-13 20:54:04 At night you can apply coconut, olive, avocado, almond oil if you don’t have specific cuticle oil.
1481 2018-02-13 20:53:56 The midstreamers up on the Sam Houston Tollway (North Belt) are probably at the Jimmy right now.  The Jimmy used to be partly owned by several P&O Falco oil traders back in the late 80s. #OOTT
1482 2018-02-13 20:53:41 Another ridiculous attempt to rename an icon. But leave it to our schools to “teach” the new names which has happened at the elementary school level in Chicago. It is just wrong. Long live the Sears Tower, John Hancock and the Standard Oil buildings.
1483 2018-02-13 20:53:40 But imagine how much cardboard and packing would need to be made (jobs jobs!)..and how much less oil dependant we'd become with all those delivery trucks hah
1484 2018-02-13 20:53:32 You should have brought it home and cooked it instead of letting it waste. Lemon pepper, hair, and tons of oil. Ape Gang style.
1485 2018-02-13 20:53:17 Just read it in the answers.  Nice, that oil rocks.

1487 2018-02-13 20:53:00 You can order hemp oil and CBD oil from California. Even if your state won’t allow the sale of it, it can still be mailed to you legally.
1488 2018-02-13 20:52:53 How much compared to animal agriculture? I'll go look up coconut oil.
1489 2018-02-13 20:52:51 You asked what America could do about poverty. I answered. You haven’t addressed those specific things, instead you are off on a tangent about Norway’s oil revenue. Most countries provide universal healthcare and stronger social safety net and worker protections, not just Norway
1490 2018-02-13 20:52:38 Y'all been fighting over drums vs flats, fried in the same oil & seasoned exactly the same, cooked at the same time, for years; y'all ain't tired?

1493 2018-02-13 20:51:57 I always wear a grass skirt and oil up before taking my flag for a walk so I can understand how she was confused 
1494 2018-02-13 20:51:42 I hear you but I just don't see it from Ottawa's standpoint. That term is just something I can't see a team taking unless the Oilers eat almost half of Lucic's salary.
1495 2018-02-13 20:51:33 I got those plus: coconut oil, grape seed oil, ghee, and crisco.
1496 2018-02-13 20:51:15 I use a lumberjack oil which smells just like pines! Great fresh smell
1497 2018-02-13 20:50:59 Do the wineries get subsidies anything like what oil companies get? Yeah I didn’t think so.

1500 2018-02-13 20:50:41 I hate going to any car place,All I want is my oil change,I don’t need you to offer me anything else

1503 2018-02-13 20:50:26 I haven’t taken any fish oil pills in years but they help wit my joints . I forgot that them fuckers kick back up when working out
1504 2018-02-13 20:50:21 How is Trump building up our military good for Russia? How is Trump exporting natural gas and oil in record numbers to compete with Russia in Europe good for Russia? How is Trump extending sanctions on Russia good for Russia?
1505 2018-02-13 20:50:17 OMG

The 2018/19 season will be the first season where players born in 2000 are drafted and will/could play in the NHL.  

Remember Y2K?  Oil was at $30/Barrel The Devils won their first Stanley Cup. Pavel Bure Scored 58 goals.  Rick DiPietro was taken first overall.
1506 2018-02-13 20:50:15 Oh btw -- Not sure if I mentioned it, but my Mitsubishi Evo block(s) are now at the machine shop. I'm having them installing oil squirters inside the non-turbo block, just to be sure we have enough piston cooling.
1507 2018-02-13 20:50:08 $ZN move is comical, pr's keep getting pumped into streaming... they were drilling for oil and they encountered it a bit earlier... big deal, so they found what they were looking for.. nothing but a short squeeze.. just look at the 5 year chart.
see ya back at 2.6 near term
1508 2018-02-13 20:50:01 Why does @thebodycoach always use coconut oil, I hate coconut

I'm fat cos I don't like coconut otherwise I'd be eating and training like #JoeWicksTheBodyCoach instead of watching telly and eating pizza 
1509 2018-02-13 20:49:30 You have a depiction of wine for Yakima Valley but not an apothecary bottle of artisanal beard oil for Portland. What’s the deal?
1510 2018-02-13 20:49:26 Glad your enjoying the oil money lads
1511 2018-02-13 20:49:26 I hear there are big oil reserves Mar a Lago. Go there.
1512 2018-02-13 20:49:23 I hate coming to Snellville but free haircut and free oil changes undefeated 
1513 2018-02-13 20:49:22 Because it makes sense? Alberta should have been refining many years ago but then the oil companies would have a physical presence on Alberta soil & not just wells that they can discard & leave for the taxpayers to clean up. Out of sight out of mind.
1514 2018-02-13 20:49:13 Why would anyone want to live in a small oil producing country of only 5 million souls? 
1515 2018-02-13 20:49:05 The motivation of #warcriminals Bush, Obama and Trump isn't hard to instead: money/arms sales and oil. None of the countries or groups where we're murdering folk has attacked the United States nor do they pose a direct threat.
1516 2018-02-13 20:49:03 Congress Pidis: What have Modi's trips achieved ? Tho sunho India to become a regional oil storage trading hub, with UAE & Saudi to park crude oil in our storage facility as strategic storage,& to supply subcontinent customers #vision #newIndia #AccheDin @OfficeOfRG

1520 2018-02-13 20:48:44 The first paragraph is talking about cbd instead of the real culprit which is the fake cannabinoids. "An alarming number of military personnel were sent to the hospital in January after experiencing health problems potentially related to cannabidiol (CBD) oil."
1521 2018-02-13 20:48:33 Last time I got an oil change I bomded w the mechanic and he gave me a discount bc he had a daughter the same age
1522 2018-02-13 20:48:32 2 things   1. $ weakness has had nothing to do with equity weakness    $ marginally stronger since equities peaked.    2. real economy much less sensitive to market moves than people think.  see 2016 where despite everyone calling for recession on oil/spx, economy survived
1523 2018-02-13 20:48:23 This devil thinks his plan can work. Sub finish, i renew, fuel no dey i go buy, now oil needs to be changed 
1524 2018-02-13 20:48:14 Being in OK I can say he was hated here as Attorney General, too. He thinks of himself as the greatest and is smug and deceitful. His main concern was being friends with all the rich oil guys. He’s also hoping to be AG if Sessions goes.
1525 2018-02-13 20:47:57 Not necessarily. Sometimes condensed water from the air inside the valve cover can mix with the oil residue on the cap, making it look like head gasket failure. Are you having any other symptoms?
1526 2018-02-13 20:47:55 argan oil!
1527 2018-02-13 20:47:53 Not really,I don’t have any control over oil or wine. This is my opinion and it would make me happy if the pipeline expansion doesn’t go through.

1529 2018-02-13 20:47:50 And the nasty whale oil link. Not very PMish
1530 2018-02-13 20:47:50 ah how about oil and those impossible to deliver futures contracts its all a degree of fake just figure the rig and play it
1531 2018-02-13 20:47:49 Got some Teatree oil stuff for my faceit's over for these blackheads
1532 2018-02-13 20:47:45 Oklahoma Republicans have sold the futures of our children to the oil and gas industry for decades. It’s no wonder the state is last in the nation in every category where education makes a difference. #voteoutGOP
1533 2018-02-13 20:47:38  what is it? Oil?
1534 2018-02-13 20:47:24 Another ridiculous attempt to rename an icon. But leave it to our schools to “teach” the new names which has happened at the elementary school level in Chicago. It is just wrong. Long live the Sears Tower, John Hancock and the Standard Oil buildings.
1535 2018-02-13 20:47:21 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
1536 2018-02-13 20:47:20 SNAP sells processed junk food cheap enough for the poor to afford. The frozen veggies, produce and olive oil pictured are luxury items.
1537 2018-02-13 20:47:15 invest in an oil diffuser bc peppermint really helps
1538 2018-02-13 20:46:58 sitting in a hot bath with my Lush oil bomb, a joint, The Office and a big ass glass of ice water
don’t bother me i’m busy
1539 2018-02-13 20:46:54 Turks on the boarder of Cyprus and threatened Greece and Cyprus because they want oil and gas that is in Cyprus boarder. Turkey are just assholes. The whole world hates them
1540 2018-02-13 20:46:48 Where’s the trade sanctions against Quebec and Ontario when they said no to your Oil @RachelNotley you know this Oil should be going east instead of importing it from Saudi Arabia why don’t you stand up to Federal Government instead of making BC your scapegoat
1541 2018-02-13 20:46:09 Smith is not an unmovable asset
1542 2018-02-13 20:46:07 This whole the kurds control 40% of Syria’s energy is objectively untrue, and anyways the pumping stations for those oil fields is under government control, it’s not about the oil as much as it is about Syrian sovereignty imo
1543 2018-02-13 20:45:59 two words: cuticle. oil.
1544 2018-02-13 20:45:58 Yo, if he come back with it with oil stains on it, bet your mom asks for another copy, haha. Not that I think he’d be able to part with it to loan it to her either

1548 2018-02-13 20:45:36 Gwyneth doesn't have time for us little people.  She's too busy selling snake oil to other flaky rich people.
1549 2018-02-13 20:45:30 Nagsisisi ako sa kinainan namen Hahaha baka malugi kainan nila kase inubos ko sili sa chili oil nila 
1550 2018-02-13 20:45:26 Sir Krishna Godavari basin is the biggest oil&gas reservoir in the country .state lost in earlier discoveries .please see that state don’t loose out in new discoveries and that is his main interest in the state and make good were we lost earlier .
1551 2018-02-13 20:45:14 Fact  wait til the gas and oil slows be a ghost town
1552 2018-02-13 20:45:14 Amateurish painting. Looks like it's done by first year art student.
1553 2018-02-13 20:45:13 I’ll be on @OnTheMoneyCBC at 4:00PM EST to discuss oil market fundamentals, the latest IEA report, and what’s going on with the WCS discount.
1554 2018-02-13 20:45:13 Then why are you supporting environmental oil?
1555 2018-02-13 20:45:12 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1556 2018-02-13 20:45:10 This oil is making my fingernails look so ugly. 
1557 2018-02-13 20:44:54 yes, it has the earmarks of a giant photoshopped pic that then may have been rendered in oil (or NOT!)

Both these portraits are very peculiar, if not hideous.
1558 2018-02-13 20:44:51  I also add sriracha and/or chili oil to spice it up a bit more
1559 2018-02-13 20:44:48 Half of the salary increase is covered by the savings from taking back Smith.

So it's a savings of ~$1.2M x 2 before the incremental cost of $2.75M kicks in in year 3
1560 2018-02-13 20:44:26 When holding up "northern European socialist democrats" I never hear the reason they have money for wonderful social programs is north sea oil production. And very small populations. Wouldn't it be more honest to start the conversation - in oil rich Norway..........?
1561 2018-02-13 20:44:24 2006:  Dr Samsam Bakhtiari—It is extremely difficult to forecast precisely the price of oil in the future. I can see a range of $100 to $150 not very far into the future.
Senator JOYCE—That is $100 to $150 a barrel?
Dr Samsam Bakhtiari—Yes, this we are certainly going to get to

Blessings way too strong bruh, imma lose an arm or some shit to maintain equilibrium.
1564 2018-02-13 20:44:19 Flour, caster sugar (not too much as burns quicker), 1 egg, oil and milk. Cool pan. Perfect pancakes  every time
1565 2018-02-13 20:44:17 Sick of Bayern, the Spanish shithouses and the oil doped clubs.
1566 2018-02-13 20:44:16 Trying to dry my tears from yawning because I can't let it mix with the makeup, oil, dirt because that stings my eyes
1567 2018-02-13 20:44:15 $ZN- is "Encountered Oil" a new oil & gas term.  

Asking @FortWorth_SEC, did we just "Encounter a stock promotion?"
1568 2018-02-13 20:43:54 Indeed, specially when you have a good team
I took us less than half an hour to complete the Oil of empire operation today although we played all 3 maps 
1569 2018-02-13 20:43:53 Perhaps you don’t remember why we are in Iraq ?
Remember that nice Mr Hussain invaded Kuwait to steal there oil and wealth. 
Then nice Mr Hussain used  WMD against the Kurds.

It was a lost opportunit for Iraq to become a decent nation but this the mentality of the region
1570 2018-02-13 20:43:49 It is usually more cost efficient to move further towards the ultimate supplier. Cut out the middlemen (coal, oil, gas) as far as is practical.
1571 2018-02-13 20:43:45 Oil makes strange bedfellows
1572 2018-02-13 20:43:34 No oil
1573 2018-02-13 20:43:32 That report details how the Dept of Agriculture is combating fraud (because it's so obvious it exists), and how successful they are at reducing it.

Guess which dept administers SNAP? Dept of Agric.

Ask yourself: would you accept a no-pollution report written by oil companies?
1574 2018-02-13 20:43:32 That would be great if THE PEOPLE get the proceeds of the money from extraction from their own property, but no!  Developers and the oil industry take the profits for themselves and leave destroyed land for the people to clean up and live on.
1575 2018-02-13 20:43:31 if wti crude could not close & sustain above 64.80 in next 6-8 months than oil MKT 100% crash & will try to find new bottom below 22.56@
1576 2018-02-13 20:43:29 I've drank so much Lemsip and sniffed so much Olbas Oil I'm starting to bloody hallucinate
1577 2018-02-13 20:43:25 $ZN what a novel concept, an oil company found some oil?
1578 2018-02-13 20:43:13 The first one was perfect, so Dad got that one. That's the one I flipped. I forgot to put oil in the pan for the second one and I turned into brains. What you see is the third in the pan. The wonders of editing, eh?
1579 2018-02-13 20:43:07 I’m so sleepy but I’m getting my oil change and tires changed in a few minutes so I can’t go home and crawl into bed yet  
1580 2018-02-13 20:43:02 Essential oils is an exspensive happy. But man I love those diffuser recipes.  Always seem to need another oil though. 
1581 2018-02-13 20:42:58 Alberta could stop all transfer payments because they can't afford them. That should wake a few people up! Also, if you don't like pipelines, stop using anything made with oil or shipped/trucked/delivered using oil. Let everyone know how that goes.
1582 2018-02-13 20:42:48 Butttt my steel oil pan is on!!!! Yeeeeee, next is skid plate!
1583 2018-02-13 20:42:46 Peak Oil ? Sans certitude aucune.
1584 2018-02-13 20:42:35 Thats what I was thinking, needs the spoiler thing on the top, bullbars on the front and the oil tank things near the cab doors
1585 2018-02-13 20:42:32 $62 for an oil change? That's extremely expensive wtf.....lol
1586 2018-02-13 20:42:31 @renmommie 'We wanna drill for oil on Teddy Roosevelt's head....' #TheSimpsons
1587 2018-02-13 20:42:30 Not gonna lie I could really eat some bread and oil with balsamic right now
1588 2018-02-13 20:42:24 I don't know. Horton's wasn't, which is how TOR made the Clarkson trade work, but I'm not familiar with MacArthur's situation.
1589 2018-02-13 20:42:24 I got asked what I wanted for Valentine’s Day.... My Jeeps oil changed, detailed and lifted after tires are rotated..... the blank stare said it all when I ended with a beer/whiskey and a bacon burger.
1590 2018-02-13 20:42:24 Since the olive tree was more useful (olives, olive oil, shade from tree) she won. And he was mad.
1591 2018-02-13 20:42:22 Modesty and royalty are like water and oil
1592 2018-02-13 20:42:17 they made this for profit your countries . you need wars to rise but oil is not cheap so easiest way is to make wars . make countries need weapons and you have all weapons  they needed smh . oil now cheap . i have more to say but sure u  can't take this much
1593 2018-02-13 20:42:08 A7 coconut oil instead of veggie oil #TeamGoodFat
1594 2018-02-13 20:42:05 A mystery for many Americans is how their oil was deposited in Arab lands.
1595 2018-02-13 20:42:01 We have Local Brimstage Brewery Trappers Hat and Scarecrow both real ales. Beavertown Gamma Ray on draft we then have various cans & bottles inc Neck Oil, 8 Ball, Juicebox etc
1596 2018-02-13 20:41:43 a7,  I like baking with apple sauce instead of using oil #teamGoodFat
1597 2018-02-13 20:41:15 The realiry: Transitioning away from oil is not likely going to occur in your or my lifetime. Eventually yes, but not in the foreseeable future.
1598 2018-02-13 20:41:05 Banana pancakes for Shrove Tuesday (does it count as irony?) - banana, soy milk, flour, maple syrup, coconut oil  #veganhour
1599 2018-02-13 20:41:01 Sure but two yrs of paying a guy not to play is likely far more easy to take than 5 yrs at $6M per...not even a discussion.
1600 2018-02-13 20:40:51 i expect my hair to have grown at least 10 inches by the time i wash this castor oil out
1601 2018-02-13 20:40:41 A7 Reduce sugar and use honey for sweetening. Olive oil for cooking and baking instead of butter .  #TeamGoodFat
1602 2018-02-13 20:40:41 That’s always an awful process! Use some castor oil
1603 2018-02-13 20:40:32 Annual average  oil and condensate production will never reach 100 million bbl/day (high confidence). 

Ditto 90 million bbl/day (medium confidence). 

Peak crude oil and condensate will be reached prior to 2040 (high confidence). 

Dictated by market forces.
1604 2018-02-13 20:40:29 The only people that Trump is playing is you idiot MAGAtards who bought into the snake oil salesman pitch.  Congrats.

1607 2018-02-13 20:40:15 The US goal in Syria is perfectly clear - to keep control over the region that leads the world in the providing of oil and natural gas. ~ Petr Lvov
1608 2018-02-13 20:40:14 tbh you can use regular hair oil too and pay half of what you'd pay for "beard" oil while getting the same result
1609 2018-02-13 20:40:12 - u all still go by what eyes can comprehend u don't realize God his people r spirit beings some have got more spirit infilling if don't beleive so then how is it some of church foolish lost all oil and went to hell not heaven?
1610 2018-02-13 20:40:09 It will be helpful when we admit that this IS America.  Except for a brief time from the New Deal until Reagan, this country has never cared for the poor or the hungry.  Oil subsidies are necessary.  Food subsidies are indulgent.  And we call ourselves exceptional.  Hah!

1614 2018-02-13 20:39:51 @On_pphire any other solution would include Exxon leaving the oil and gas business.
1615 2018-02-13 20:39:48 Very good move. Surprise that hasn't been done till done by the present executive. How can we import palm oil, embarrassing?
1616 2018-02-13 20:39:37 A terrible pun: superficial => super fish oil. 
It's really bad, but I find such things hilarious. Please feel free to sigh...
1617 2018-02-13 20:39:31 Imma use a glove with baby oil
1618 2018-02-13 20:39:30 Yes! I want to cover myself in coconut oil, hug him like a koala and slide all the way down his body 
1619 2018-02-13 20:39:24 I have another bone to pick with Bath & Body Works. You all keep killing off my favorite fragrances but this one is being slowly murdered. You have eliminated Aromatherapy Energy Orange Ginger line by degrees over the years. First it was the bath salts & the concentrated oil...
1620 2018-02-13 20:39:23 Do you want the Marshal of the Supreme Court coming after you, buddy? Keep it up!

1622 2018-02-13 20:39:20 I've never used beard oil before, so I'll take your actual suggestion into account.
1623 2018-02-13 20:39:12 Yep ... exactly. I saw this crap in my youth working in the oil fields. They used the word ni&&er like I use the word fuck. And I like & use the word fuck a lot. And that's when they were sober.

1625 2018-02-13 20:39:08 @HF_Trader what made you choose to just focus entirely on oil insted, of just daytrading stocks, or nq? Im curious
1626 2018-02-13 20:38:57 I made vegan pancakes for my brother using literally just oil and flour and almond milk and?? They taste EXACTLY the same as ur average pancake???! Amazin
1627 2018-02-13 20:38:52 You were farmers until the oil money
1628 2018-02-13 20:38:40 Because in non capitalist countries everyone gets a free car?
1629 2018-02-13 20:38:38 I quite like the softer line tbh! Love this, reminds me of an oil slick (in a good way, the middle colours are dreeeameh)
1630 2018-02-13 20:38:08 'Hm. Maybe not sauce but we can try it with oil. Or...' He was already back on his feet and rummaging around in one of the drawers. Finally having found what he was looking for he sprinkled a pinch of crumbled walnuts over Loras and his food. 'Let's try this.'
1631 2018-02-13 20:38:07 the term is the thing I don't know if they go for, but it's a cost savings in real dollars for the next few years, which matters to their ownership.

What happen to all the money that was given to LOUISIANA by BP for Oil Spill.
1633 2018-02-13 20:38:03 Are you using just pure castor oil or is it mixed in a product?
1634 2018-02-13 20:37:36 No avocado oil?
1635 2018-02-13 20:37:34 Yes, will try it with oil paint next time. Acrylic wasn't the right choice 
1636 2018-02-13 20:37:32 its funny that an oil and gas compnay just now found oil.
1637 2018-02-13 20:37:19 100g plain flour, 300ml milk, 2 eggs, 1tbsp sunflower oil, pinch of salt. Whisk together and leave to stand 30 mins before cooking. Non-stick pan, quite hot. Bob’s your uncle.
1638 2018-02-13 20:37:17 Over 4 hours for an oil change and tire rotation??? @FirestoneAuto How is that acceptable???
1639 2018-02-13 20:37:17 @LizClaman It's absolutely HORRIFYING to hear you say Dennis Gartman is a credible market participant.  The guy is a snake oil salesman, constantly peddling his worthless newsletter. He's nothing but a momentum trader, and is constantly selling at the bottom, buying at the top.
1640 2018-02-13 20:37:11 The plan in Ottawa will be to sign their captain long-term and with that being the case, they can ill-afford to have that much term tied up in Lucic
1641 2018-02-13 20:36:56 i have recently begun using coconut oil and it does the job very well in addition to being v cheap
1642 2018-02-13 20:36:42 nope have paid attention to spreads when doing rice cash and carry that is it. never trust an oil led bean rally.
1643 2018-02-13 20:36:41 Venezuela actually helped poor outside there own country and gave them free oil!
1644 2018-02-13 20:36:31 Nope you missed the point.  Most of  the new wealth generation has come from Blue states.  Only red state contributions have been where they have have gas and oil..otherwise red states live on welfare generated by blue states.  DATA

•Grapes must be

•Diamonds form

•Olives are pressed to

•Seeds grow in

Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed, or in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation/transmutation!

1668 2018-02-13 20:34:14 Confusing crude oil term structure so despite the backwardation it is time to SHORT WTI at $59.29 and Brent at $62.59.
1669 2018-02-13 20:34:12 Scotland makes a fair amount of oil revenue but Norway is the big dog. Billions.
1670 2018-02-13 20:34:12 Yea with some rice but if you do it use better instead of that oil they used

1674 2018-02-13 20:33:56 Quite depressing to see in 2018 how few full promises your govt has delivered, how many watered-down, and how many completely scrapped.

You complain, and then cheerily dole out pancakes in an Enbridge uniform, while cutting regs and expediting oil & gas projects. It's sickening.
1675 2018-02-13 20:33:46 An oil money team vs a feeder team
1676 2018-02-13 20:33:41 I have a better one, and a lot cheaper: a tiny dab of coconut oil rubbed into your palms and onto your armpits. Lasts all day and no grease on your clothes. Advertise that.
1677 2018-02-13 20:33:41 I still feel like Kehlani smells like transmission oil.
1678 2018-02-13 20:33:37 @KellyRek Old 80s joke about 2 dogs that would meet at the border between #Morocco and #Algeria. #Algerian dog was rich (oil&gas) but couldn't bark (speak); the #Moroccan dog was poor but could bark his mind. They'd meet at the border so one can bark freely, the other could eat.
1679 2018-02-13 20:33:36 I took a sleep aid last night with melatonin in it and used lavender in my essential oil diffuser and slept for 14 hours straight. What the hell

1682 2018-02-13 20:32:49 Liked are retweeted! This video is AMAZING! Can’t wait to get out to Vegas and do some shopping at the first CBD oil retail chain! @JoeVargas @BuyLegaIMeds #CBDLivin 
1683 2018-02-13 20:32:46 Vitamin D3 / K2, Magnesium, Fish Oil are the foundation. At least to me.
1684 2018-02-13 20:32:32 I usually add some olive oil to it too

1687 2018-02-13 20:32:00 I just put peppermint oil on my sore back and WOW I’m living my best life shout out to Nicolle
1688 2018-02-13 20:31:58 Trump wants to let oil companies drill under mt st Helen's maybe could use the fool to plug the holes
1689 2018-02-13 20:31:57 The background was Giclee  (Ink jet) printed to canvas, actual oil brush strokes were applied to offer realism, and Obama was painted in.
1690 2018-02-13 20:31:36 Seeing fluff articles about best pancakes and I'm wondering how different pancake recipes can be. I've used the same recipe forever. 4oz (113g) flour, ½ pint milk, 1 egg, pinch salt, glug of oil. (Most importantly, rest the batter.) Is anyone's much different to this?
1691 2018-02-13 20:31:30  Naa but grab that baby oil or Vaseline
1692 2018-02-13 20:31:19 just a drop of cooking oil, not too much, hot frying pan, and a more consistent batter.Enjoy.

1700 2018-02-13 20:30:37 #greenwichhour you are making me laugh today! @monsheabutter not as good as putting it your skin. . But they do use it as an oil to cooking in Africa
1701 2018-02-13 20:30:27 Apply oil so you don’t look dry. Brush your hair, blend your makeup well. You have a fat face like mine? Do hair that falls on your face so it looks smaller in pictures.

1704 2018-02-13 20:30:11 I was supporting her. She has every right to tell about these people taking money from oil companies. Mostly GOP are taking cash from big oil companies. That is why we are going to be in trouble soon with dirty water, dirty air and no food. This admin is going 2get is all killed
1705 2018-02-13 20:29:59 They obviously want out.  Let's face it, producing oil is like goals in hockey, whoever produces the most, wins...right?
1706 2018-02-13 20:29:59 so i dipped both sides of the bread in egg and then panko bread crumbs, and then cooked it in like a quarter of an inch of oil in a pan.
1707 2018-02-13 20:29:53 Yeah idk that’s so weird ahaha cuz I’ve always left on for an hour. I’d try doing it with coconut oil next time or aloe cuz they’re soothing
1708 2018-02-13 20:29:49 Oil companies use something called "barrels of oil equivalents" to disguise the ongoing shift to gas @FabiusMaximus01 @theresphysics

1711 2018-02-13 20:29:33 Since when does it take an hour and a half to change oil?????????
1712 2018-02-13 20:29:01 Thanks! Little vinaigrette with red wine vinegar and olive oil! Do recommend :) Next purchase: balsamic lol
1713 2018-02-13 20:28:38 have you tried making it with olive oil? maybe that will work for you.
1714 2018-02-13 20:28:37 Oil change cost me 50...
1715 2018-02-13 20:28:35 The age of "Goods for IOU" globalism ended when the only way the west could make those IOU's "dollar-good" was via QE (see CB balance sheets.)  This is driving the age of "goods for goods" globalism (see US oil exports) - this age requires a MUCH weaker USD.

1718 2018-02-13 20:27:39 Here’s a tip, don’t spill olbas oil all over your tights.
1719 2018-02-13 20:27:37 oil on canvas: "ARCHITECTURE OF THE SKY III is located at the front of the neck" (Another Crap Art TM 1988)
1720 2018-02-13 20:27:32 Nice White bedroom or neutral colours. No caffeine and lavender oil- on the pillow, lavender leaf in your herbal tea. When anxiety is bad I have the rain app which is BEAUTIFUL to fall asleep to. #blurtchats
1721 2018-02-13 20:27:32 Like it or not the dependence on oil will have to stop. Why not do your job as a politician and boldly help provinces like Alberta transition away from oil while at the same time protecting the hard working men and women in the oil industry. You work only for the oil lobbyists.
1722 2018-02-13 20:27:29 Fundamentally Russian/Putin's systemic strength was & is function of oil prices. Oil is 40% of budget revenues, gas just 10%.
1723 2018-02-13 20:27:21 Oil Museum is something you can’t see elsewhere. If you have transportation, Utstein Kloster is nice. 
When will you be here? We should have coffee!
1724 2018-02-13 20:27:20 Instead of building walls, buy plots of desert land in neighboring countries to build Parabolic troughs on, which are far cheaper than solar cells. They heat oil which is then converted to electricity.
1725 2018-02-13 20:27:15 oil on masonite: "UNTITLED (SMALL PAINTING WITH I STICK) and milk ejection in nursing women" (Another Crap Art TM 1978)

1727 2018-02-13 20:26:36 @KristjanHebert zip tie keys to the dipstick to ensure the oil is checked. 
Improved my education today. Involvement in a board has made me wiser.

1729 2018-02-13 20:26:33 Since I don't have subordinates, tell your legislator to tax oil to the top level of the law, 7%. The legislature has given reductions to every oil group like 1% for horizontal drilling. Tax the biggest welfare queen-oil to the max of current policy. Tax wind. This is not new law
1730 2018-02-13 20:26:30 badly burnt my finger making pancakes now I’m stood here fingering an unused tub of coconut oil ffs this is why I don’t cook
1731 2018-02-13 20:26:26 I keep hearing about using castor oil on lashes & I’m very intrigued
1732 2018-02-13 20:26:15 asi se pasaran la vida creyendole los cuentos a maduro,mientras el recibe a los invasores en Miraflores,y les da oro y oil.
1733 2018-02-13 20:26:14 & Sweden etc. import our waste for their plants to give them energy - why are we not looking at the same to reduce our dependence on oil? Swedish system is run by private companies as well.
1734 2018-02-13 20:26:06 How does the Boston Dynamics robot respond if it leaks oil on my carpet and I proceed to grab it by its neck, shove its nose in the oil stain, and tell it what a bad death machine it is?
1735 2018-02-13 20:26:03 And your picture looks like an old leather boot. Are you also a genius too? As far as I see your mouth is bigger than your bank account.
1736 2018-02-13 20:25:58 and, funny thing, I just read an article on focus groups. It's because Betty Crocker wanted to sell more cake mix to guilty-for-not-cooking moms that you even need to add the egg and oil. Used to be in the mix. Even cheapah
1737 2018-02-13 20:25:31 Someone in here smells like African Pride and coconut oil...
1738 2018-02-13 20:25:30 vegetable oil

1740 2018-02-13 20:24:50 The article stated plainly the solar power employs more than coal and oil combined. That is not accurate.  I was pointing that out.
1741 2018-02-13 20:24:45 Wait .. like you dunked that bitch in oil???
1742 2018-02-13 20:24:39 I have to oil it everyday- it’s a pain in the ass

1745 2018-02-13 20:24:37 Shouldn’t forget the oil and gas industry (for good or bad) ramping up these past dozen years (even though most companies are located just outside of Allegheny county)
1746 2018-02-13 20:24:28 Get real:
Realize nuclear energy does not produce CO2. 
Close gas based power plants.
Close rubbish fueled power plants.
Close coal based power plants.
Close oil based power plants.
1747 2018-02-13 20:24:27 The massage oil after effect was an unexpected bonus. Clever.
1748 2018-02-13 20:24:26 Does condensate is oil or not?  because 21% of growth is condensate (200k bpd)

1750 2018-02-13 20:23:58 When will my oil change be done?? 
1751 2018-02-13 20:23:58 Oil & Gas can either come to the table and take the 5%, or the people of OK will send them the bill at 7% from the ballot. It’s really their choice.
1752 2018-02-13 20:23:56 A4. I love eggs scrambled in a bit of olive oil paired with avocado and whole grain toast. Keeps me full for hours! #teamGoodFat

1754 2018-02-13 20:23:50 Oh please.  You are fighting for short term big oil profits and the investments of big banks.  You know (or should know) oil will not be a fuel resource in another 10 to 20 years at best.  Oil is dying.
1755 2018-02-13 20:23:49 Since I don't have subordinates, tell your legislator to tax oil to the top level of the law, 7%.

1756 2018-02-13 20:23:39 Shea butter is great for skin and shea oil is great for dry scalp and hair - and your products are top quality! I see on your profile that you're also a "part time pizza maker"... what are shea products like as pizza ingredients? ;-) #GreenwichHour
1757 2018-02-13 20:23:15 What do you think they have in those great big tanks full of rocket fuel crude oil?
1758 2018-02-13 20:23:09 Natural gas has a slightly better outlook than crude oil & condensate. This is why majors now shift to gas @FabiusMaximus01 @theresphysics

1763 2018-02-13 20:22:33 i would watch Queer eye for the Gay Guy, where a thirty-something cis white gay moves from his condo into a queer co-op, cuts up his amex platinum card, replaces his kiehls with a jar of coconut oil, breaks up with his brunch friends, and gets THEIR first stick and poke

1776 2018-02-13 20:21:11 Put a little too much oil in my bike, neutral has vanished lmao

1778 2018-02-13 20:20:51 for straight oils any health food store like natural grocers, etc should have those and more with their essential oils. im not sure what drugstore selections are like w those tbh. for an oil cleanser they should have them at drugstores and beauty supply stores (dermalogica is A+)
1779 2018-02-13 20:20:44 Thank you, Elizabeth. Pardon my absence. I appreciate your reply and I agree with you. It's very sad to see all the bickering and anger going on between Canadians. In all of Alberta's oil history you would think they would be tops in refining their own resources.
1780 2018-02-13 20:20:34 ...or instead of a tax, how about eliminating the subsidies that exist for the oil companies that provide gas for those vehicles?
1781 2018-02-13 20:20:27 It is disgusting. I've worked all over Africa. Prostitutes frequent all hotels where Westerners gather. Some oil workers and other contractors are shameless in using them, development workers generally do not. Almost all development workers are brave, altruistic people.
1782 2018-02-13 20:20:19 Prinical and business go hand and hand. Business and bs is like oil and water. Don't mix.
1783 2018-02-13 20:20:14 ニンニクマシマシのマシ！
1784 2018-02-13 20:20:05 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
1785 2018-02-13 20:20:01 "the rest of the US doesn’t have those kinds of oil reserves, which makes the math of financing a similar policy at the federal level tough."  You misspelled 'impossible.'  How about Vox explains their plan to pay for our existing unfunded liabilities first?
1786 2018-02-13 20:19:49 When you put so much coconut oil on your face, your makeup slides right off.
1787 2018-02-13 20:19:35 tea tree oil really does help with scars , i’m just saying .
1788 2018-02-13 20:19:34 BWP didnt even go up much when oil was flying
they gonna do $700 million in FCF even with recontracting after they finish their growth projects

1789 2018-02-13 20:19:29 I seriously can’t wait for the day electric vehicles take over and all these oil companies go bankrupt.

1794 2018-02-13 20:19:12 Sardines makes sure it's in water or olive oil not soybean oil, replace fruits in syrup w/natural fruit juices or water, if you must eat from a box load it with veggies, replace can beans w/fresh beans. Again $90 only goes so far per month.
1795 2018-02-13 20:18:52 Civil servants and salaried people are not productive. Sacked airline, oil companies and Etisalat staff are not productive. Only you and politicians are productive. Sure, sycophancy is productive but only a privileged few trade on that.
1796 2018-02-13 20:18:33 My dad just paid for my oil change and took me to lunch while we waited  what a man, I love him to death
1797 2018-02-13 20:18:27 When you're frying something in a pan full of burning oil & you feel like having some water and you take the whole gallon of water & start pouring it in a oil-filled pan & only when the oil bursts into flames you realise you've crossed all limits of absent mindedness

1801 2018-02-13 20:18:08 Republicans prefer roads that pave themselves, dirty water from streams poisoned by de-regulated factories, beaches covered in oil, and schools that lack the ability to teach our children that lying is NOT perfectly acceptable.

1808 2018-02-13 20:17:06 White critics were lambasted for giving it less than 5 stars, so I'm not sure if white people are allowed to see it. If you don't think it's the best movie ever and/or doesnt win best pic it will be because of racism.

1812 2018-02-13 20:16:32 Really proud of the Dems in #okleg the past couple of days. There is a better deal that doesn't put the onus on making up a budget shortfall caused by cuts in taxes on Oil Corporations and the wealthy on the poorest Oklahomans & emerging industries that can diversify our economy.

1818 2018-02-13 20:15:39 come into merchant's for a simple oil change/tire rotation and he tells me my shocks are fucked. i mean i knew that but i've been avoiding the hell out of it
1819 2018-02-13 20:15:19 I literally can’t get an oil change without feeling incompetent
1820 2018-02-13 20:15:17 I conduct house visits and inspect their pantry's and refrigerators. I help them to make substitutions based on what they can afford. 

Instead of Tuna in soybean oil replace w/ tuna in water, replace high sodium vegw/low sodium and make sure the ingredients are water and veg
1821 2018-02-13 20:15:13 Breakfast, car wash, oil change, post office, jewelry repair, vitamin shoppe, Gym… I think that’s it

1826 2018-02-13 20:14:41 Various reasons I suspect. Some say it was part of globalist agenda to destablise region and flood Europe with migrants, thus destabilising Europe. Some say he wanted to push a gold currency for Africa and trade oil in gold rather than US dollars.
1827 2018-02-13 20:14:39 I have some and like it a lot too. I have oily skin and feel like it helps oil control too.
1828 2018-02-13 20:14:32 Oil fell 6.61% right after that big RIG block-sell there, between Feb6 and Feb9 closes, and RIG fell 8.2% between Feb6 and Feb8 closes - great timing by that huge block seller and put-buyer!

Today's blocks are buying oil and selling AAPL+IWM, be careful out there!
1829 2018-02-13 20:14:24 I've got a great recipe for pancakes; take eggs, flour, milk, oil, sugar & a lemon and chuck them in the bin and have an ice cream. (credit to Ally-at-work, only she said vodka ... probably funnier ... rum 'n' coke, maybe?)
1830 2018-02-13 20:14:15 Bio oil has been the best thing to happen to my skin 
1831 2018-02-13 20:14:09 U are so ridiculous! Calling Canada fake allies! Canada should just immeaditely stop all resources going to the states like water, hydro and oil. Also charge for 6.5 million dollars owed that for hydro that California never paid for. Plus interest!!
1832 2018-02-13 20:14:02 I’ve never done that. I always do coconut oil. Or coconut oil and fresh aloe

1841 2018-02-13 20:12:59 Since I don't have subordinates, tell your legislator to tax oil to the top level of the law, 7%. The legislature has given reductions to every oil group like 1% for horizontal drilling. Tax the biggest welfare queen-oil to the max of current policy. Tax wind. This is not new law

1847 2018-02-13 20:12:02 Oil production is a separate business from marketing and distribution.

1850 2018-02-13 20:11:28 These look more like giant 4 legged insects. A potential kafkaesque nightmare. Countries taken over by giant plastic insects operated by some evil enemy country wanting your oil, gas, land, pipeline ...

1855 2018-02-13 20:10:57 Discussing overpopulation right now is comparable to consideration of asking a newborn baby to chew gum. Real issues exists: polluted oceans, continued oil spills, corrupt leaders whom place money over people and planet, and an already high proportioned disenfranchised pop.
1856 2018-02-13 20:10:53 It’s all about big oil and big corporations lining his pockets

1858 2018-02-13 20:10:41 Remember when my mom thought that "CBDistillery" meant Columbus brewing company on my purchase history and got angry at me for buying cbd oil which she said I could buy cause she thought I spent 40 dollars on beer. I don't even like beer.

1866 2018-02-13 20:09:51 And I’m sure him taking away the healthcare of millions is super beneficial. And his cabinet filled with Goldman Sachs cronies and big oil bullies has everything to do with his desire to help people. 
1867 2018-02-13 20:09:41 Basel open their legs for the oil money hahaha
1868 2018-02-13 20:09:32 Gosh, that must be tough! Dog aggression is a problem. Do you use a muzzle? I had a rescue cattle dog who was dog aggressive for a while and muzzle really helped her to socialise safely. Is the oil working?

1878 2018-02-13 20:07:41 cetaphil is one of the best drugstore brands for sensitive/dry skin, def check their stuff out. their daytime moisturizer is rly popular. also try adding an oil cleanser to balance oil production or incorporate an oil like rosehip seed or jojoba (never coconut) w a night cream
1879 2018-02-13 20:07:38 I was thinking maybe we just drop you into a giant vat of boiling hot oil?
1880 2018-02-13 20:07:36 70$ for a damn oil change

1882 2018-02-13 20:07:25 @jamesmassola @adamgartrell @markgkenny 2006 Senate Inquiry oil supplies Hansard: Senator JOYCE—Who can afford oil at $200 a barrel? Who would be using it? Dr Samsam Bakhtiari—I think the Chinese are ready to pay anything for oil. I agree with you that it will be very difficult
1883 2018-02-13 20:07:03 I don't. It would hurt lots of people. I think Trump's idea would tax heating oil heavily and considering he isn't going to fund LIEAP.....ya not good
1884 2018-02-13 20:06:59 I know it's easy to buy into the oil and gas industries lies, that's what I have been raised and shoved down my throat since my entire life. Once you start to look into yourself their "theories" start to fall apart.
1885 2018-02-13 20:06:58 I agree Let's reach down & renew that innovative adaptive Canadian that built this country Not the one that relies on foreign oil & gas corporations Let's not shame ourselves by ignoring our Paris commitments-let's go sustainable energy We can do it and more people work that way

1892 2018-02-13 20:06:17 since you're already revising, have you looked at delta in labor income? My (weak) prior is that oil pays better than gas, but it's not based on much
1893 2018-02-13 20:06:12 No mention of the stone wall penalty.... Loooool oil money kept that hush quick
1894 2018-02-13 20:06:10 #fed #ecb #investment #inflation  Expect a print of 2.29 inflation rate in my morning, slightly higher than expected due to OIL, wage increases, and imported inflation.  TLT should drop to below $117.00

1911 2018-02-13 20:04:12 Propofol (the most common anesthetic to put people to sleep) is an emulsion of egg white and soybean oil. Mayonnaise is an emulsion of egg and oil. Propofol is sleep-inducing mayonnaise.
1912 2018-02-13 20:03:54 I had to use food stamps way back when my kids were tiny.  I remember the joyful giddy feeling  at being able to afford fresh fruits and vegetables instead of disgusto boxes of off-brand macaroni made cheap with oil instead of butter 
This move of grifter45* is deplorable.

1917 2018-02-13 20:03:17 Reason why I speak out against scammers and snake oil shit coins is they stain all of the good crypto projects out there..  Tron is nothing more then a plagiarized white paper with no real use case, product, or history #FACT
1918 2018-02-13 20:02:59 The bigger issue is that by 2040 the oil industry will be running on a single lung, oil production simply won't meet demand unless prices rise a lot lot lot. And poor nations won't be able to afford it. You should put on a third world hat.

1924 2018-02-13 20:02:09 I will never forget the day a nurse asked me if I was pregnant bc I put my farsali oil on my face
1925 2018-02-13 20:01:53 The thing tire me. i prepoo using hot oil treatment overnight, detangle, shampoo, dc and style. Then i do a scalp massage during d week
1926 2018-02-13 20:01:52 Because we have few other industries other than oil and government have come to rely on oil so much that they have failed to diversify our economy despite continually talking about it.

1950 2018-02-13 19:59:37 Putin and Russia and all their stupid bots will never come close to what South Korea is. They are dependent on oil. There is no innovation other than in bot making to divide people.
1951 2018-02-13 19:59:23 Or a gold-backed oil trade instead of the current petrodollar
1952 2018-02-13 19:59:23 These niggas been doin an oil change for 3hrs

1954 2018-02-13 19:59:15 The car you drive. Land had to be cleared to build a factory, Power plants, digging for oil, refineries, etc.
1955 2018-02-13 19:59:05 So you're saying transport by rail is safer than pipeline, or are you against oil all together?
1956 2018-02-13 19:59:03 Iron Olive Oil. Sounds pretty healthy
1957 2018-02-13 19:58:45 Now tell me how drilling more oil domestically than Russia due to reducing regulations on fracking helps.
1958 2018-02-13 19:58:40 Thank you 
1959 2018-02-13 19:58:36 “Are you suggesting I light you up to appreciate your true beauty? I hear oil and fire go nice together.” 

He was imitating the others tone now.
1960 2018-02-13 19:58:30 Thank you 
1961 2018-02-13 19:58:26 Sounds like you are talking about criminals with weapons and the three officers, I doubt, were shooting at each other.

What exactly is the point? And can you provide a detailed break down of the thirty people killed?

If not, it really is just a lot of bugle oil.

1966 2018-02-13 19:58:03 The administration.  They're selling pristine parkland out west for oil and coal.  They want to sell parts of DC.  No joke.

1969 2018-02-13 19:57:59 Are you having a laugh. EPA now stands for Earth Polluting Agency under @ScottPruittOK management  as you now operate  on behalf of big oil, coal and other polluters.
1970 2018-02-13 19:57:56 lmao just saw some1 share a post on fb of a picture of pure cbd oil and how “symptoms... disappeared fast” with said ‘symptoms’ including ADD/ADHD, autism, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, & strokes to name a few. i dont think ive ever seen anythin more genuinely stupid in my life
1971 2018-02-13 19:57:50 Really reassuring to know that trump is following the wishes of the citizens of the US, in regards to our National Par... Wait! What! WTF!  Pipelines! He’s selling our Parks for effin outdated oil? Pipelines! I can’t even...
1972 2018-02-13 19:57:44 What about producing H2 (or perhaps better,  NH3) in sun-rich areas and transport that to higher latitudes by (former oil) tankers? Surely not efficient, but maybe effective.
1973 2018-02-13 19:57:34 Your point also applies to this pipeline; which is it then?  Funny that we have a refinery in BC that doesn't get enough product. Someone please explain why BC doesn't just buy more Alberta Oil and stop buying from the US?  BC Opposition is to the tankers mostly. Win win?
1974 2018-02-13 19:57:24 WTF!  US is going to get into Another M.E.War!
It's all about Control, Oil & $$$$$$$
There is A Big War! coming....

1977 2018-02-13 19:56:54 Policy implemented. Can you even try to respond to that? Are you even capable? It requires independent and critical thought- (they don’t have a subscription for that in the post.)
How does Arming Ukraine, increase Oil drilling, Saudi deal& Syria force benefit Russia?
1978 2018-02-13 19:56:44 drink ur water and use ur coconut oil
1979 2018-02-13 19:56:44 .....as long as it runs on coal, and oil!!  We don't want that f'n solar crap!!!! Lies is all it is!!!

1986 2018-02-13 19:55:50 Indian energy businesses are buying into oil concessions abroad to supply energy for their 1B population.

1987 2018-02-13 19:55:38 Why can’t you respond to the exact questions I’m asking? I’m asking how arming Ukraine, deal with Saudi, force in Syria, and increase US oil drilling helps Russia? It’s all policy that hurts them. You keep citing articles of pure conjecture of “collusion”. I’m speaking to actual

2007 2018-02-13 19:53:01 More importantly, they have the brains of an oil painting, too.
2008 2018-02-13 19:52:52 Oy vey! Under Obama we drilled for more oil here in the US, Hillary is unapologetically pro-fracking as is Tim Kaine.
2009 2018-02-13 19:52:47 I tell what it is. Yr 1 freezing cold. Yr 2 just above freezing and after that you slowly become acclimatised. When you are burning heating oil at 100 Ltrs a week you will find it’s positively balmy in January. My wife is in a hat and scarf 
2010 2018-02-13 19:52:47 There’s only two thing my dad taught and  those are yo not look down when I walk and how to put oil in a car.

2016 2018-02-13 19:52:15 Update from the oil change waiting room. An old man audibly mumbled “fuck this”, walked over, grabbed a donut, and walked outside.
2017 2018-02-13 19:51:54 we have a great recipe for drop-scones (tiny pancakes) that is from an old be-ro recipe book. it's vegan too. i think it just involves flour, oil and sugar. maybe other stuff. my mum makes them since i can actually eat them :D

2019 2018-02-13 19:51:38 There are many diff things but its pretty simple once u find what works for you 
Ie I wash my hair with cold water (only) on Sunday evening and put coconut oil and let it rest all night with a towel and shampoo it off in the morning
2020 2018-02-13 19:51:33 Mine actually belongs to an old Persian oil baron who I sold my body to on the internet for this sweet preused edition of Dark Souls III.
2021 2018-02-13 19:51:14 Even if we accept for a moment the "evidence" you have provided , it is still quite a stretch to justify attempting to solve a humanitarian crises by creating a 10x bigger crises which coincidentally enriches military contractors and serves interest of big oil and finance...
2022 2018-02-13 19:51:10 But they’re fried! So doesn’t the oil decrease the #glycemicindex and make them more metabolically efficient?
2023 2018-02-13 19:51:06 better plan for who? oil barons
2024 2018-02-13 19:51:06 No, I’m saying it’s very complicated. The biggest influence presidents have to answer to is public approval, and securing oil and stopping Russia have been very in line with that.
2025 2018-02-13 19:51:02 Things I learned from queer eye: covocnut oil gets rid of funny smells on body, if you can press into an avocado a little bit then it's good
2026 2018-02-13 19:50:41 #ORIGINPCLIVE well i would probably post on media that i found a rich oil source and add fake pics so that world's powers (USA...) gank the place and fight the adventurers instead of us, u ask yourself wouldnt they attack you too? Probably not cuz what is outside is all simulated
2027 2018-02-13 19:50:40 In other words, under virtually any deep decarbonization scenario, it seems to me that the the price of oil will be determined by demand rather than supply.
2028 2018-02-13 19:50:40 Ages ago when you got actual stamps, you could go get a dozen eggs or so and get change back so you could go buy toilet paper or soap. But I am sure that was abused by people buying gas or cigarettes with the change.  Not that big tobacco and oil barons made sure you needed that.
2029 2018-02-13 19:50:11 Coconut oil mixed with tumeric to whiten teeth? Need to try it out. Sounds ridiculous though.
2030 2018-02-13 19:50:00 Better for your skin than coconut oil which can sometimes clog your pores
2031 2018-02-13 19:49:58 @LittleMix Perrie tell your mom @mothergoose2020 that you dont put oil on the pan for making crepes 
2032 2018-02-13 19:49:52 Yes, but it's basically super fancy mayo made with olive oil. I put it on everything now... but I miss spicy food some times

Syria ''covets'' its own land? U claim our rights to be there for the oil WE want.
2047 2018-02-13 19:48:33 Oil too hot. <<Top flip there, make a note.
2048 2018-02-13 19:48:29 My prediction for the long term price of oil is $30-$35/barrel.  
Calculation is based on the cost of gas remaining $3-$4/MMBTU.
If oil prices drop below cost of gas, oil displaces gas in power plants.
If oil prices go above $35/barrel, coal gasification replaces oil reforming.
2049 2018-02-13 19:48:22 Good luck having more free speech than the oil, insurance, pharmaceutical industries, etc, etc.

2088 2018-02-13 19:43:27 I don't believe it. Daesh, with their warped ideology, would not collaborate with secular Kurds. I can believe they might have collaborated, and sold oil to, other Sunni Muslims who would like to see the Caliphate restored, however.

2093 2018-02-13 19:42:53 Question: booze bottles in guest suite in Drew and Linda honeymoon home: was it real? Looked like water/vodka, olive oil/whisky, balsamic vinegar/port? Have been wondering since episode aired... 
2094 2018-02-13 19:42:52 Does Jamaican caster oil truly work?

2097 2018-02-13 19:42:28 It's only"Canada's" oil when oil companies want to "get it to market" It's always been"Alberta's" oil when it comes time to share royalties,guarantee cheaper gas prices,or discuss a National Energy Policy. It's corporate oil -Alberta gets little,Canada less- BC almost nothing.
2098 2018-02-13 19:42:02 So more people die.  More pollution from oil, coal more people die. Reduce safety food supply so more people die. Trump murdered people in Puerto Rico.

2099 2018-02-13 19:41:59 So is AC refrigerant. Not that it can be in your oil. Looks like antifreeze on a driveway if a line busts.
2100 2018-02-13 19:41:36 I never would’ve guessed that the secret to keeping my face from getting oily throughout the day would be to add oil to my already oily skin!

2102 2018-02-13 19:41:11 The protections of artistic license, thanks to Post Modernism in art critical theory, now extend the same Artistic License  protections to both an oil painting and a photo-montage. We cannot legally discriminate or treat unequal the two works of art.

2105 2018-02-13 19:40:46 That’s actually a bad bet! Already drying Wells needed big investment and India will get 3rd quality crude oil, more costs on refining hence costlier the  fuel!

2109 2018-02-13 19:40:29 this is why we are still pumpin oil the word unsustainable literally means that you cannot sustain it.
2110 2018-02-13 19:40:22 Lol there was no attack. BC was looking at its options. They have the right to protect their water/economy and request safety plans for such. Albertans are like Americans; threaten to take away oil or guns and they both react violently and without reason.

2122 2018-02-13 19:39:36 Although Native American privilege does exist. 

My roomate gets free healthcare for life for being Native American.
She also gets oil money every month because the reservation she belongs to has natural gas. And she gets a check every month just for existing. Like $700 a month.

2124 2018-02-13 19:39:18 Not only did my cars headlight just go out, but I need to get the oil changed, get it SMOGed, and get new registration all within the next month 
2125 2018-02-13 19:39:17 CBD/cannabis oil can help a lot. I have two dogs with severe anxiety that take it. Also taking the time to expose them to things to show them it’s ok. You treat it the same way as in people, tbh. It takes time.

2127 2018-02-13 19:39:05 More and more I think that's the last fake move to catch in a trap all BTFDers... The market is DEAD today. Oil hangs like a constant value, ShortVIXers are doing what they can to to crash volatility, but 10Y=2.85 is crashing the market in the background. Won't end well...
2128 2018-02-13 19:38:51 Danish oil is quality.

2144 2018-02-13 19:35:45 There’s a secret to avoiding this....
Rub the pan first of all with oil on some kitchen roll, making sure you coat everywhere. I guarantee this ensures pancake # 1 is as good as the rest.

2175 2018-02-13 19:32:37 Guess I'll make it official as of today. I officially don't believe the Oilers can make the playoffs. Needed at least 2-of-3 on that trip. Got swept, came home and let up 7. If the Oil go 21-3-3 in their last 27, they barely crack a 50% chance. #Fallin4Dahlin #StillLoyalTho

Debt is because of political decisions over many decades. I disagree with some of those decisions, but they were no doubt informed by accurate information provided by very smart people.

2212 2018-02-13 19:29:15 This tired argument again?

It's a false equivalence. Globally, we have enough fossil fuels to continue to drive and fly and still create oil based products (which can also be created using different polymers not made from fossil fuels), before we have better technology.

With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

2240 2018-02-13 19:25:28 Absolutely.  Garlic, rosemary and thyme in oil/butter.  High heat to sear and drizzle butter and oil over the meat after you turn the heat down.  Let rest about 4 min .

2247 2018-02-13 19:24:14 Gotta admit struggling with the premise so far. Earth running out of oil so limited power. They have a space station with artificial gravity so a decent time in the future...we would've made advancements in say solar power by then

2260 2018-02-13 19:23:02 It depends on where the oil is coming from. Where frankincense comes from the trees are wild and organic, but these places can't afford or even get a organic label in developing countries. This is when we have to go off of purity standards of a company.

2270 2018-02-13 19:21:55 Can't states like Washington deny oil rigs from entering ports such as Seattle?  Can't factors such as the Cascadia fault be considered to deny oil rigs from operating in the waters off of the Washington coast?  Couldn't the same be true for CA and OR?

2277 2018-02-13 19:21:19 It’s made of surimi (a paste made from fish) and starch, oil, sugar, etc. like fish balls u see at Asian supermarket. I just had no idea they use that to make “shrimps” too

2285 2018-02-13 19:20:31 Also, Russian has already made a $2 Billion oil deal with the Kurds in Iraq. And even Iran also told Turkey to stop their attack on the Kurds in Syria! Looks like Turkey is very much ALONE in this insistence that the YPG and the YPJ are bad!

2290 2018-02-13 19:19:30 Oil was not just a bonus. It was central to the economic case for independence. Now we have demand outstripping supply, people moving over to electric cars, use of plastics being reduced etc etc. The dream is a distant memory.  
2291 2018-02-13 19:19:23 Really need to schedule a oil change but i really dont want to spend $70

2295 2018-02-13 19:18:39 @gracehelbig puts a calming essential oil she found online on her dog’s paws and it seems to work really well!
2296 2018-02-13 19:18:34 1.05 Billion is spent on electric vehicle subsidies. Maybe instead we should eliminate the 20.5 billion dollar oil subsidies handed out annually.
2297 2018-02-13 19:18:28 My oil change in Cottonwood was fuckin $50. Here in Tucson it was $25. 
2298 2018-02-13 19:18:26 There's a refinery in Burnaby. It wasn't even receiving enough oil from Alberta before. And expanding the pipeline puts those jobs at risk.

This pipeline expansion only benefits mostly foreign companies, and whoever receives "donations" from them.
2299 2018-02-13 19:18:25 @Soluna129 Nice! How often do you go for oil change?
2300 2018-02-13 19:18:05 A bad (high) CPI will probably spook stocks and bonds, sending both down.  Keep in mind oil has dropped below $60/bbl.  Early surveys suggest those who received "Trump bonuses" from tax reduction are paying down debt rather than going on spending sprees.  That's not inflationary.

2307 2018-02-13 19:16:56 Tight oil production projection is too high unless price increases significantly, and even then probably too high in 2018 due to several constraints.  Demand projection is too low unless the global economy slows significantly.
2308 2018-02-13 19:16:55 perhaps! but I don't know how we get there from manuka honey and mafura oil (moral of the story: this is what i get for forgiving shea moisture)

"You're a chef, you say? Well if you use olive oil instead of butter, you're not a real chef!" - gatekeeping.

"You're a chef, you say? Why don't you show up for work when the restaurant gets busy?" - not gatekeeping.

2365 2018-02-13 19:10:17 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
2366 2018-02-13 19:10:13 #45 and the Republican Party have control of the ENTIRE government.

Flint, MI still has dirty water. There's an oil spill from the Dakota pipeline that has spoiled acres upon acres of land. The nation's infrastructure remains falling apart. Puerto Ricans, our fellow America…
2367 2018-02-13 19:10:11 Good day to all! Your favorite Mexican President is staying home today. I will be working with the oil industry officials to clear up the auctions.

2369 2018-02-13 19:09:49 Old Oil man telling trapping stories today! Love when he comes by!!
2370 2018-02-13 19:09:46 Coconut oil????
2371 2018-02-13 19:09:44 Actually if they tried to sell the oil I bet the U.S. would say sorry this is ours now.
2372 2018-02-13 19:09:44 If your statement is true, which I think it is, then why would POTUS put trade taxes in place to drive up the cost of solar energy?

A real POTUS... a Patriot, would not hurt the people he was elected to represent.

DT does not represent 99% of Americans. He's all about oil & $$
2373 2018-02-13 19:09:43 Yes nah. Light NUPENG and other oil sector strikes, they give warning strikes but the chaos and scarcity lasts past the call off date.
2374 2018-02-13 19:09:41 Nice 
2375 2018-02-13 19:09:32 The world financial system and currencies is measured in US petro dollars. Whoever controls energy controls the world. Nuclear, oil, gas and electricity are the main economic drivers. Due to climate change the future is in clean energy!
Batoka is a strategic investment.

2377 2018-02-13 19:09:08 about to go get my oil changed which means being extremely judged by all of the mechanics on how shitty my car is lmao
2378 2018-02-13 19:09:01 And big oil lobby. Plus cronyism.
2379 2018-02-13 19:09:00 And here I am, naked in my living room slathered in coconut oil, thinking I was on a path to redemption.
2380 2018-02-13 19:08:41 yeah rhats fine! it has a bit of tea tree oil in as well, which actually will probs help as well but just so ur aware
2381 2018-02-13 19:08:30 Sadly, we do.  Stopping it would be like trying to stop a rolling freight train with your good intentions and body.  Oil has an embedded economic momentum.  There is no stopping it, just reducing wanton growth.
2382 2018-02-13 19:08:15 160$ to flush my tranny tho ... really mozzerella I jus changed your oil ungrateful bitch 
2383 2018-02-13 19:08:12 Me too.
2384 2018-02-13 19:08:01 See WaPo article! Running in rural WV county hoping to get $1500 total for campaign agst oil co influence. Her campaign has gone viral & she has raised $20,000 since this hearing!  #ElectLissa
2385 2018-02-13 19:07:44 Nope, I would use flour, sugar, salt, oil, water and a mixture of the correct spices in the right proportions.
2386 2018-02-13 19:07:44 Oh my!!
2387 2018-02-13 19:07:40 Just had the nicest conversation about palm oil with an old man at Trader Joe’s. Have a great Tuesday everyone. #TheMiracleOfPalmOil

2394 2018-02-13 19:06:32 I’m glad I got it. If nothing else it’s a nice face massage, and I did feel like it helped to work my face oil in better. Plus it makes me feel fancy.

2397 2018-02-13 19:06:05 What does being a Democrat mean to you when you have Democrats like Joe Manchin voting for Trump's entire cabinet and sides with big oil and more war?
2398 2018-02-13 19:05:57 What's worse for the environment?

All of the oil and gas industry?

-or-

One SUV boi?
2399 2018-02-13 19:05:53 Is it not 1st May the new rules come in

And I doubt it will change anything as if done properly it runs cleaner than normal fuel

But I am curious about your "smell test", what equipment do they use for this?

Additionally years ago Germany grouped Rapeseed oil in with diesel
2400 2018-02-13 19:05:49 PREPA desperately wants the gas so it can avoid spending on repairs to  its oil power plants, even as the legislature and Energy Commission  express skepticism about swapping one fossil fuel dependency for  another.
2401 2018-02-13 19:05:26 How is it even LEGAL that politicians can get money from oil companies?!
2402 2018-02-13 19:05:24 my mom just told me that my brother and his friends tried vaping with an oil diffuser machine
2403 2018-02-13 19:05:13 Oh man, I love the optimism.  Normally we hear this from Oil fans after the draft.  This is rich though.  It’s a bad, one dimensional team.  If McDavid doesn’t light the world on fire, they suck.  He must be regretting re-upping for eight years.  
2404 2018-02-13 19:05:08 Your tweet lacks olive oil and lemon pepper.
2405 2018-02-13 19:05:05 JK counts on rallying the old graying conservative base that was enchanted w Ralphie bucks, the Martha & Henry narrative. The PCs werent brilliant deal-makers, quite the opposite. They were merely awash in oil cash. Any fool appears successful if $$ falls out of the sky (ground.)
2406 2018-02-13 19:05:05 when are you expecting oil tankers ?
2407 2018-02-13 19:04:53 PERFECT VALENTIMES GIFT:

2409 2018-02-13 19:04:48 Netanyahu & Gangster share the same troubles of corruption, apparent by their cohesiveness. Remember, Obama and Netanyahu were oil & water.
2410 2018-02-13 19:04:43 @Nigeria - instead of investing billions in searching for oil, how about vanilla? Do us all a favour, prices are too high.
2411 2018-02-13 19:04:40 Its a drag fest there by free to air Christianity. Not sure which annointing oil to get now
2412 2018-02-13 19:04:30 The difference is Juuls contain tobacco plant oil. Vape juice does not.

2415 2018-02-13 19:04:12 why flax seed oil for seasoning cast iron?
2416 2018-02-13 19:04:12 Mate you need rape seed, vegetable oil or sunflower but definitely NOT olive or sesame oil, olive oil is actually the worst, very bad when it reaches a high temperature

2423 2018-02-13 19:03:14 I love when I get to the oil change place and there is no one here and I get in quick AND then a line forms #blessed

2429 2018-02-13 19:02:29 You and other YouTubers inspire me. A year ago all I could do was oil change and spark plugs. Now I'm fixing my Subaru Forester that blew a turbo. Thank you for showing me that you don't have to go to a fancy school to learn this.
2430 2018-02-13 19:02:26 Saudi are getting poorer selling oil maybe they should start selling chickens @MbSofKSA
2431 2018-02-13 19:02:14 made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk, and were served for breakfast.
2432 2018-02-13 19:02:12 What even the fuck lol. Yea I usually go to Honda but Speedy oil was just down the street. They lowered my quote after talking to my dad on the phone 
2433 2018-02-13 19:02:08 I just meant the situation in general. That we're occupying an oil refinery in Syria with our military, among plenty of other territory I'm sure.
2434 2018-02-13 19:02:00 I wanna go see Call Me By Your Name tomorrow but it's only playing at the Bijou, which uses coconut oil for their popcorn. I'm highly allergic so Imma go in a poncho, plastic gloves, and a face mask to go see a sad movie alone at noon on Valentines Day

2444 2018-02-13 19:01:13 It's okay Gary, we won't be needing fancy European foods, the stuff sold in the 'delicatessens' of yore, when you could only get olive oil from Boots - for constipation. We'll be eating spuds & turnips (cattle food in France) & Brexiter Forman's EU-protected London Cure salmon
2445 2018-02-13 19:01:05 i was very specific. i said wendy's spicy chicken is better chic oil A's spicy chicken sandwich. and that ain't the point!

2470 2018-02-13 18:59:38 Have you had any luck with oil pulling by the way? curious about that
2471 2018-02-13 18:59:27 Wait til it heals and start putting tea tree oil on it. It minimizes the scar tissue. Keep it out of the sun for a bit and always carry Shea butter. It won’t make it go away completely but it’ll help
2472 2018-02-13 18:59:25 Exactly. Behavior not becoming of a 10 yr old. JT was no better on Kinder Morgan @ Nanaimo town hall. Threatening to pull maritime response and carbon reduction plans. In an age of climate uncertainty and next mass extinction we're letting big oil dictate national outcomes?
2473 2018-02-13 18:59:24 Nope! I coated them with like two table spoons of oil! May have been a bit too much but still better than deep fried!
2474 2018-02-13 18:59:24 Let’s take the petrol prices of chennai.Crude oil price in Jun 2014 - $110 ; Petrol price in Jun 2014 -Rs72; Crude oil price in Jan 2018 - $60 Petrol price in Jan 2018 - Rs75.Decline % of crude oil from 2014 to 2018 is 46% .Increase % of Petrol price from 2014 to 2018 is 4%.

2477 2018-02-13 18:59:10 & then of course there is 'Shut up or I'll publish your info' Paula. Her history tastes like castor oil and has similar effect.

2478 2018-02-13 18:59:09 It's fair to say he is Russia's man though despite the presence of western troops fighting ISIS. They aren't helping him attack the GNA or seize oil the way the Russians are.
2479 2018-02-13 18:59:06 @PressSec, Sanders is in it for the money. She must’ve been promised an ownership of the oil exploration of Trump/Putin. Sarah  Sanders has no shame. She’s fulfilling her greed. Avarice is Sarah Sanders little god.

2497 2018-02-13 18:56:30 To late they covered in oil and gas
2498 2018-02-13 18:56:29 oil changes are a scam fabricated by the auto repair industry you don't need them
2499 2018-02-13 18:56:16 Oh...sorry... You mean, the brown rolled up mashed groundnuts dipped in oil, pepper and salt?
2500 2018-02-13 18:55:56 Dirtbag! 
2501 2018-02-13 18:55:49 Jamelle you gotta get that olive oil imported from Greece!

2503 2018-02-13 18:55:43 You can get a whole onion dark black if you have it on the highest heat with 2 cups of vegetable oil in about 5 minutes
2504 2018-02-13 18:55:40 NK and SK "appear" to be making progress, but it's only for the Olympics.  Communism and Democracy are like oil and water.  They just don't mix, no matter how it appears.  Throwing our hard-earned money at NK didn't help one bit, so maybe we should throw something else, lol.
2505 2018-02-13 18:55:39 The oil dripping from my face right now can fry puff-puff 
2506 2018-02-13 18:55:38 ใช่เลยสงสารมาก บางทีก็ให้ชีวิตส่วนตัวเขาบ้าง ทำไมจะทำอะไรไม่คิดถึงเอ็นเลยนะพวกนี้
2507 2018-02-13 18:55:35 No coconut oil?
2508 2018-02-13 18:55:35 because oil money duh
2509 2018-02-13 18:55:32 I’m crying 
2510 2018-02-13 18:55:28 @scottishlabour do you want to tell the Pensioners of Scotland how much Ireland pays its pensioners and they don't have oil?
2511 2018-02-13 18:55:14 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado. Not all fats are dangerous
2512 2018-02-13 18:54:49 She's cute.
2513 2018-02-13 18:54:45 You never can get both a beautiful person with a beautiful attitude, that's like oil&water, it DONT mix!! — feeling thoughtful
2514 2018-02-13 18:54:44 Dave must’ve been burning the midnight oil the entire offseason to come up with that decision.

"Is current #US #Oil rebound off D1 low sustainable?"
This is a simple question but the decision-making is more complex than most people think.
2516 2018-02-13 18:54:07 Use engine oil
2517 2018-02-13 18:54:06 gettin my baby a oil change .
2518 2018-02-13 18:54:04 As your constituent, I want you to oppose Trump's latest deals w the #oil industry. Not only should the govt not be so involved in business, but it should be protecting the people's lands from greedy, reckless hands. Don't be the reason for the next big spill. @JohnKennedyLA
2519 2018-02-13 18:53:56 "Between the salt rocks and the oil diffuser you will be FLYING"
2520 2018-02-13 18:53:53 For Valentine’s Day this year, I’ll be getting an oil change. Thanks for asking.
2521 2018-02-13 18:53:50 #US is not interested in the #Kurds north of #Syria. It is the oil. If the oil were south of Syria, US will send all the Kurds to #Erdogan's slaughter house

2522 2018-02-13 18:53:45 Trying to find an oil free but oil controlling moisturiser is a bastard!! Some either don’t control the oil enough or some make my face drier than a nuns fanny I like cliniques dramatically diff gel but it’s not shine free!
2523 2018-02-13 18:53:41 am sure I read that right
2524 2018-02-13 18:53:36 I want to rub baby oil all over to see it shine
2525 2018-02-13 18:53:33 This is an accurate sum up. In terms of seniors issues a similar lack of interest. Yet for the oil industry they worked flat out. So what's the diff? The power thing. And the money thing. Folks on AISH, seniors, disabled Albertans have no voice, no cash, no power. Ignored. @HQCA
2526 2018-02-13 18:53:25 And an oil change 
2527 2018-02-13 18:53:24 I love you for doing this.  My daughter has a kitchen and a garage.  I know how to change oil & a flat tire bc my parents were not afraid to be unconventional.
2528 2018-02-13 18:53:16 my mental health feels so much more together when I have a fresh oil change in my car
2529 2018-02-13 18:53:16 Got to have some peanut oil for deep frying
2530 2018-02-13 18:53:02 CBD oil worked for my abused puppy!!!!
2531 2018-02-13 18:52:49 Zan Doyle uses too much body oil
Is this how it works
2532 2018-02-13 18:52:37 That's cool to hear, why the need for fish oil?
2533 2018-02-13 18:52:36 She poured the oil 
2534 2018-02-13 18:52:36 Hey! know how us norwegians got so good at cross country ski'ing? that's how we got to work! all the way to the oil platform's....
2535 2018-02-13 18:52:35 No peanut oil?
2536 2018-02-13 18:52:20 Man :( well yes get some peppermint oil!!
2537 2018-02-13 18:52:05 An oil drum in every pot.
2538 2018-02-13 18:52:04 When will his so called "base" wake up to the fact that he's just a snake oil salesman?
2539 2018-02-13 18:52:02 Again, you are spouting theory. Do you have any documents in to back your theory? It's rediculous because there is no way he would hide more oil production. He would broadcast it to cement his base and would not be blocked politically for more pipeline.
2540 2018-02-13 18:51:39 I like them. They are art, not just staid images in oil instead of print. Iconoclastic and iconic at the same time. Great stuff.
2541 2018-02-13 18:51:37 Commodity Supplemental Food Program use to be widespread. When I was a child, I remember the Cheese. The Cheese WE got was awesome. It was a block of real Cheese. I doubt the SNAP, Blue Apron style Cheese will be anything but Veggie Oil.
2542 2018-02-13 18:51:35 Someone threw a bottle of Omega 3 pills at me the other day. 
Luckily I escaped with minor super fish oil injuries.
2543 2018-02-13 18:51:29 Castor oil
2544 2018-02-13 18:51:27 I had an intellectual conversation that started with basic religion and ended with me saying “Meat and oil f****d us up!”
2545 2018-02-13 18:51:25 Best thing I have ever tried. Put oil directly on blemishes when they come up until gone. I have tried all the $$$stuff too. I order a tea tree oil cream called Keeva from Amazon for daily use. It's amazing.
2546 2018-02-13 18:51:14 I really don’t wanna pay for this oil change 
2547 2018-02-13 18:51:03 オッケーです！ここは安いのではなく高いのを…
2548 2018-02-13 18:50:58 @__Jbro if you don’t get yo “I put crisco oil in my head lookin”
2549 2018-02-13 18:50:56 LMAO ME TOO. this summer in NYC was a new level of hell because my oil spill face had additional oil spills on top of oil spills.
2550 2018-02-13 18:50:49 Great, you've now gone ahead and started the next trend. Forget fidget spinners- scratch & sniff is the new way to stay focused and learning. Hmm....what if we created essential oil ones like lavender... #OnToSomething 
2551 2018-02-13 18:50:46 My thoughts exactly. Much food will be wasted. Many now won't or can't use canned processed foods or "shelf milk". And not just peanut butter, ground peanuts & peanut oil is now used in so many things without anyone knowing.  Who reads labels?
2552 2018-02-13 18:50:35 too all my ladies struggling with dry skin from the cold , rosemary oil is the cure !!
2553 2018-02-13 18:50:29 CBD oil. @CWHemp  does a doggy version.
2554 2018-02-13 18:50:27 They are in denial now. They will try a few times more for 60..but eventually will give up.:)
2555 2018-02-13 18:50:27 Good move , only if the wailers would not say buhari want kill them with hunger again . Because have seen a video circulated last year about this same palm oil issue when Cotonou border was tightened.u can't satisfy human being though
2556 2018-02-13 18:50:18 I am also interested in discussion of massive oil spills for my party entertainment.
2557 2018-02-13 18:50:16 This African lady got me to buy some body oil. It smell so good 
2558 2018-02-13 18:50:03 Hour and a half for an oil change. 
2559 2018-02-13 18:49:57 looks like I’m going to find some peppermint oil. Two exams tmrw.. so I can’t sleep
2560 2018-02-13 18:49:54 $COMB is less than 25% energy, if you want to make a bet on commodities that isn't a proxy for oil. I'm newly long.
2561 2018-02-13 18:49:54 Siento que estoy desperdiciando años de mi vida por estar tirada en la cama pensando que tengo que hacer y nunca lo hago
2562 2018-02-13 18:49:52 Girl make your own with brown sugar &coconut /olive oil
2563 2018-02-13 18:49:49 The prius always starts acting funny 1000 miles before it's even due for an oil change then it gets the oil change and it's fine again.
Bitch over dramatic as hell lol
2564 2018-02-13 18:49:44 Oil trades at a price we have little control over. The rest is eminently replicable.
2565 2018-02-13 18:49:41 Always think Jimmy has acute cheeky smile. Its the boy who never grew up. I have a wee lad with that same grin. 
Maybe its just Oil in the blood??
2566 2018-02-13 18:49:36 In the south, if someone uses their turn signal it means (1) It's still on from their oil change (2) It's an emergency (3) They're high.
2567 2018-02-13 18:49:31 tell us ...are you gonna have more balls then are past premeirs to stand up to BC ?? next put qubec on the same shitlist . if i had my way o would limit and BC products . foriegn or domestic  across the alberta line !! if they wont let oir oil to pass ..then why not stop them . v
2568 2018-02-13 18:49:27 @valuationgman idk. all i know is that i trade my own thesis. i was skeptical of oil at the highs.
2569 2018-02-13 18:49:25 I am always hoping a meteor will hit us, I even have the place it should hit :) 
a nice desert Peninsula full of oil... :D
2570 2018-02-13 18:49:00 This pan is excellent. I've used it several times with great results. It is the slipperiest pan I've ever seen - nothing sticks to it, not even oil. #nonstick #cookware #excellent #slippery

2576 2018-02-13 18:48:23 If only those poor people's homes and infrastructure weren't bombed by another country under the false pretences of stockpiles of WMD's so they didn't have to sell their oil.

2579 2018-02-13 18:47:50 It's oor oil.
2580 2018-02-13 18:47:37 There are such things as busses and trains... oh thats right, forgot, cars are sacred, oil companies gods and the auto industry holy in the US... if aliens came to earth theyd think cars rule our world and ask who their leader was... :)
2581 2018-02-13 18:47:16 We did not send troops to Iraq to defend it...we sent them to overthrow their government and take over their oil fields. Perhaps Exxon Mobil should foot the bill to rebuild.
2582 2018-02-13 18:47:16 yay my rosehip oil came in the mail today!
2583 2018-02-13 18:47:10 I put oil in the water for obvious reasons. Never heard of adding salt and why would you want it to taste like the ocean. 
2584 2018-02-13 18:47:09 Peppermint oil and sleep. Literally take a pill to knock you out and sleep all day. Lol
2585 2018-02-13 18:47:08 Dogs are AMAZING aren’t they?! Thank you so much for sharing your favourites, Laura What’s your favourite essential oil? I have a ridiculously big collection! X

2587 2018-02-13 18:46:56 ...out of every $100 worth of oil torn from the Amazon, less than $3 goes to the people who need the money most, those who have been so adversely impacted by the dams, the drilling, and the pipelines...who are dying from lack of edible food and potable water. #ConfessionsofanEHM

2593 2018-02-13 18:46:10 now it says in the bible that jesus used fry light to oil up his pan on pancake tuesday now if that doesn't prove that christianity is a load of bollocks i dunno what will
2594 2018-02-13 18:46:03 Ireland pays its pensioners £227 per week minimum. It does all that without oil and it isn't skint.

2604 2018-02-13 18:44:18 But shale was resilient n didnt die at $26 oil so OPEC is stuck. Do play another rnd of tank mkt only to see shale never die again? Or do they let shale finish DUCs, increase prod at rapid rate for '18? My math says they do better with less ego n less prod at $60 then the reverse
2605 2018-02-13 18:44:11 New emissions test coming in April may well see an end to using cooking oil as fuel, smell and smoke immediate fail
2606 2018-02-13 18:44:10 I either want a candle wax warmer or essential oil diffuser
2607 2018-02-13 18:44:06 There is an oil rich area in Syria and Russia is extremely interested in this area and are testing our limits in this country. (See below tweet). With our Senators who are only interested in themselves and destroying Trump, my bet is on Russia.
2608 2018-02-13 18:44:04 Oil be back
2609 2018-02-13 18:44:02 The dumb dumbs are really trying hard right now. Remember yesterday how oil fell at the last moment after pit close? Wouldn't shock me to see such a fall after API and EIA. A 6+ million build perhaps for tomorrow?

2628 2018-02-13 18:42:08 That's so funny! When I first looked at this picture, I thought of those computer-generated pictures.
I also think he took a photo of Obama and just "airbrushed" oil paints over it and called it a painting. IMO
2629 2018-02-13 18:41:32 I get that. Most in my parish clean their brows before they leave church and I don’t see a problem with that. The liturgical action that wins it for me is that I make the same cross on their foreheads when they are baptized (but in oil). It’s a massive “Death... BUT!”

2633 2018-02-13 18:40:59 Actually if your pan is hot enough, and there’s only a small amount of onion in the pan so it doesn’t steam, and you don’t use too much oil, it can get golden brown. <3
2634 2018-02-13 18:40:52 And yet the plans keep getting made, and sold, and the snake oil salesmen are still pushing this nonexistent map at policymakers and school districts alike.

2647 2018-02-13 18:39:41 Advice to 1Ls out there wanting biglaw jobs: just sell out fully. Join business law society. Join the oil and gas journal. Join freaking Fed Soc. Sell out 100%. Why go halfway?

2650 2018-02-13 18:39:03 Ben Shapiro is this generation's William F. Buckley. The most articulate defender of conservative rhetoric available, but essentially nothing more than a snake oil salesman. 

Let them be a constant reminder: the ability to say something calmly is not equivalent to its truth.
2651 2018-02-13 18:38:59 @JerryMoran  Jerry we need about 5 plants to make Gasoline out of coal.  You can make gasoline out of coal for the same price of $30.00 oil.

2654 2018-02-13 18:38:51 No, just like normal pancakes but coconut oil instead of eggs and soya milk instead of dairy.

2658 2018-02-13 18:37:59 I also make a damn good pasta salad.
And it's vegan, for a while I didn't even realize it but I don't use any meat or animal products in it. Just pasta, olive oil, vinegar, seasoning, olives & artichoke hearts and it is SO GOOD. I actually make it so it's half veggies too
2659 2018-02-13 18:37:53 What of the annexation of Golan Heights for oil drilling? Israel is currently moving anti-air missile defense systems into Golan Heights. (Which is in Syria, an actual sovereign nation).
2660 2018-02-13 18:37:49 Who knew putting the essential oil lemon in your water from @doterra would really give you an energy boost... and it taste amazing! I'm impressed
2661 2018-02-13 18:37:39 booms are also used in oil spills so i like to set them up in my tub and submerge because if it's good for an oil spill, it's good for me.
2662 2018-02-13 18:37:38 Israel did 9-11. Never been a doubt in my mind about it!
They probably also did Oslo 22/7-2011 attack, after which Norway stopped supporting Palestine, and cancelled a contract with Russia, intended for Norway to develop The Shtockman off shore oil field.
2663 2018-02-13 18:37:26 Iraq Central Gov is full of corruption the sooner the we realize the better. sitting on seas of oil but can't pull itself up?

2668 2018-02-13 18:36:49 The kitchen was not a fire source, but another room. Also in this fire, a continuous explosion sound was confirmed and the fire reached the whole building in a short time. In each room, an oil fan heater was installed. (has power supply)

2674 2018-02-13 18:35:41 I always say, truth separates like oil and vinegar ... rising to the top to expose itself. No need to seek it as it will show up. This WS thinks they are exempt from such chemical reactions.

2679 2018-02-13 18:35:20 What lies were that?. You know Thatcher sold the Electric companies you know Thatcher closed down the mines sold the water boards, gave the oil profits to the rich in tax breaks etc Now you agree with more tory bollocks.

2681 2018-02-13 18:35:15 Hi.  She'd have to get on her web and ask for volunteers for a specific geographic area.  She can do that.  She needs a GoFundMe online like all the other politicians are doing. and keep good records.  Gas/oil people and koch bros will be all over her.
2682 2018-02-13 18:35:14 I use great northern, black or garbanzo. Spray a sheet pan with nonstick. Drain and dry a lil bit, throw them on the pan. Drizzle a little oil, spice em up (I use chili lime seasoning). Roast @ 400F for 20m, shake halfway through. They get crunchy, good for snack or topping!
2683 2018-02-13 18:35:14 If the snake oil that Comrade Bernie is peddling is "resonating" it's bc he doesn't tell them about the ultra-high taxes THEY too will pay. He brushes off their wait times. Wait until they are in pain for a procedure that is not necessarily "urgent." He is peddling a false utopia
2684 2018-02-13 18:35:07 #dow added to dow short position - inflation data tomorrow for january will not be good for markets - weaker dollar in January allied to significantly higher oil prices will mean hawkish outlook for rates - looks a nailed on short to me.
2685 2018-02-13 18:34:59 So wonder how long Ima be here for this oil change.
2686 2018-02-13 18:34:54 well it's actually the same companies...the oil companies own most of the refineries.  which just takes crude oil and makes it into what we use in about every type of mechanical fluid.

2699 2018-02-13 18:33:31 I use olive oil (because it's what we'll always have around) and a safety razor, but otherwise same. Sometimes alum block instead of cold water if I can be bothered.

2709 2018-02-13 18:30:22 As I’m putting oil in my hair, I remembered this old lady who needed coconut oil for her face (her friend suggested something that involved CO) and I let her know to patch test since it’s fairly comedogenic
2710 2018-02-13 18:30:20 My SS check went up $9 a mos this year, the exact amount my Medicare went up monthly, BUT that $9 increase triggered $168.00 a year less aid.

2715 2018-02-13 18:29:48 Things aren't as dire on the truck as I mentioned. Fact: I'm not a mechanic. Fact 2: Rust in the coolant looks like oil to me. Fact 3: More condensation in the oil than I'm used to looks like coolant to me.
2716 2018-02-13 18:29:45 A lot of ppl been bashing coconut oil for your skin, but honestly it makes my skin look lovely. What doesn’t work for some works well for others
2717 2018-02-13 18:29:35 Thats because to have to ship it across other provincial jurisdictions, hence its paid out. 47 ppl died in Lac Magantic. 47 families affected. Or are you sending oil by Cargo Plane?
2718 2018-02-13 18:29:31 i’ve been a mess all week I ruined a fenty highlighter spilled argan oil everywhere got drunk 5 times and burst out crying at least 4 times but i can’t be sure about that
2719 2018-02-13 18:29:24 Not as significantly as with the “assistance” of mankind, no. You really think that oil spills, more cars on the road, the hairsprays, commercial farming chemicals, massive deforestation, etc don’t affect the climate and Globe?
2720 2018-02-13 18:29:21 When your maintenance required light (oil change) is flashing & a low tire pressure light is on  I don’t have time for this.
2721 2018-02-13 18:29:19 Wow im awake, ready, already had lunch, and my oil changed before 12:30 this is a big deal.
2722 2018-02-13 18:29:09 Curious as to why Health & Human services secy had to step down for doing the same thing but Pruitt doesn’t? Maybe  bc Pruitt is on with the oil and gas guys AKA Russian interests?

2751 2018-02-13 18:25:07 my husky is wild and a pain in the butt sometimes around bedtime. I spray a pet safe lavender oil spray on his collar or his bed and that seems to calm him sometimes.
2752 2018-02-13 18:25:05 The temperature dropped overnight here. 

Things I have discovered in the freezing cold this morning: 

When you put coconut oil on your face, it freezes by the time you reach the barn. 

The cat is much friskier. 

I apparently only have one glove.

2757 2018-02-13 18:24:13 Despicable! The corruption will not end as long as we have lobbying.

2762 2018-02-13 18:23:55 Overlay the debt cycle with the generational cycle. And then overlay the technology cycles, oil > information. We are bottoming a slow growth secular cycle and entering a fast growth secular cycle.  After a 5 yr bottoming, rates will rise for 30.

2770 2018-02-13 18:22:51 what else do you stand for.  be VERY clear about it because your opponent likely will be a GOP jerkoff.  hopefully won't fight you viciously in a verbal way but if you get one of those you're going to have to be ready.  oil/gas will back opposition and go after you.
2771 2018-02-13 18:22:39 The oil is already being treated as a perscription for medicinal purposes.
2772 2018-02-13 18:22:36 The First Nation was ripped off by Enbridge.  Enbridge never made any payment to my first nation and stole our lands and treaty territory.

With your version land owner rights.  Did that give my people the right to execute oil executives 40 years ago over thievery?
2773 2018-02-13 18:22:36 But does the pun or the fish oil bother you most I wonder?
2774 2018-02-13 18:22:33 So last month I threw out my little frying pan that always, reliably made PERFECT pancakes because I decided it was knackered looking. And the new one is RUBBISH and the pancakes are sticking and I’ve splashed hot oil on my thumb and I’m hot and cross & #pancake day is RUINED.

2782 2018-02-13 18:21:52 Thank you!! The Target tip is appreciated. :) Before now, all I've had to learn how to do is add oil, coolant, air to my tires and surprisingly, change a tire! Haha

2794 2018-02-13 18:19:21 Personally I feel that this is Russia's aim. I think the Coalition attack on the Tribal Fighters and Isis Hunters a few days ago was the response of the DMC and US to a deal made between factions holding the oil fields there and Damascus.

2807 2018-02-13 18:17:34 We should have the taken the oil and used it to payoff the debt.  How about this the next foreign adventure we run part of the country until we recoup our costs and obtain a suitable profit.  Train the locals to take over so they continue to profit.
2808 2018-02-13 18:17:33 Did you know that Kinder Morgan has been shipping oil safely out of the Westridge Port since 1953? Not one tanker spill.
2809 2018-02-13 18:17:33 Hehe, yeah . Kids prefer them too, with suger on top. Or just with Nutella. They always ask, when is Aunt Conny coming with her Mom's old frying pan (b/c this old thing makes it at best , teflon ones are bad). And we use no oil, but neutral kinda vegetable fat b/c of taste.

2812 2018-02-13 18:17:14 The decline in oil prices is a somewhat separate (and more regionally focused) issue, whereas the general health and stability of the economy was far superior compared to the US and the U.K. Plus we already take most of Bernie's "radical" policies for granted etc.

2817 2018-02-13 18:16:48 yes! it has a matte finish so it will help reduce oil
2818 2018-02-13 18:16:46 I never buy anything with palm oil. People need to read the labels on the products that they buy. They do disguise the palm oil with different names such as stearic acid, glyceral stearate, sodium laurel stearate, vegetable oil and many other deceiving names.
2819 2018-02-13 18:16:34 Nah but my grandparents have a place out there and bring me back oil from their tree. This bottle is from a harvest out here though

2912 2018-02-13 18:06:35 Don't do it, brother!
Turn today around! 
There's so much today left!

Burn the midnight oil if you have to.
2913 2018-02-13 18:06:32 motor oil isnt for drinking
2914 2018-02-13 18:06:27 I think that dubious elements within #SDF (tribes with Islamist ties+US-funded #FSA groups") will try to create on behalf of #USA a new army to control #DeirEzzor oil fields.The YPG will join Syrian Govt and get for this large autonomy #within Syrian boarders.supervised by Russia
2915 2018-02-13 18:06:23 It's like 20 dollars for the oil to do an oil change and like 25 at most shops, it's worth the extra 5 lmao
2916 2018-02-13 18:05:55 They can't silence all of us. It's time to call out these people and let the public know where their true loyalties lie. I admire her very much for what she did. She stood up to these oil & gas-rich bastards and told the truth about them. We need more like her, not them
2917 2018-02-13 18:05:48 I went to get my oil changed in my car and they basically told me to throw the whole thing away and get a new one. Nice!!!!!
2918 2018-02-13 18:05:47 I won an oil painting of myself once from a popular sweet brand. It's fucking sick.
2919 2018-02-13 18:05:39 How y'all fry your chicken wings? Like do you bread it? What kinda oil?
2920 2018-02-13 18:05:32 In that case get back to your kombucha and your beard oil and your avocado toast and leave the conversation for the grown ups.
2921 2018-02-13 18:05:28 Maybe they just didn't want to hear how pitiful the sums of money are for which they sold their souls.

2923 2018-02-13 18:05:12 TRUMP: "We have ended war on American energy."

2935 2018-02-13 18:04:43 CBD oil is good for their anxiety, they sell them as little treats too ! I give them to my cat sometimes
2936 2018-02-13 18:04:42 Agreed, but dirt-cheap oil will be mighty tempting to some countries that aren't too committed to climate action.
2937 2018-02-13 18:04:27 Before my dog passed away, we used to give him CBD oil. They make it from hemp, and it alleviates all sorts of anxiety. He was a pom/chihuahua ANXIOUS, any vet remedy did not help. The only thing that worked for him and kept him at normal levels was CBD.

2940 2018-02-13 18:04:13 Well, if you still think Olive oil is only used for salads then you would know it can also fry and when not in oil form can be dipped into alcohol for a martini

2943 2018-02-13 18:03:41 syria is actually the most crude oil producing country in the whole of the levant, it's true that taking over the oil reserves would cripple them by crippling the economy but it's still a significant amount of crude oil
2944 2018-02-13 18:03:41 The US is stealing the oil.  Trump campaigned on "taking their oil" in Iraq, remember?  Russia develops the oil & revenues go to the Syrian govt.

2955 2018-02-13 18:02:32 the best way to make it is to sauté it with olive oil, salt, black pepper and put it in the oven
2956 2018-02-13 18:02:29 Agreed. This is one reason it’s important to look at what 45Q and subsequent CCUS learning curve cost reductions will do for EGR costs and resulting GHG intensity, rather than just focusing on EOR at today’s oil price.

2965 2018-02-13 18:01:57 They broke something underneath when they changed my oil. I’m guessing it let go yesterday and just pissed all the oil out.
2966 2018-02-13 18:01:56 Ah Yes, burning the midnight oil
2967 2018-02-13 18:01:53 I'm sure you fight this hard against foreign oil, chemicals, drugs etc etc coming into the country and risking the waters and our people. Not to mention your raw sewage being spewed into the ocean.

Also, married couples are obligated to abstain from sex. In short, we get off easy, Church of Rome.
2979 2018-02-13 18:00:49 So I think we should create networks between Earth protectors to build an alliance against big oil companies and climate change. What do you think??

2983 2018-02-13 18:00:24 No money ever exchanged hands, my first nation never received a dime from Enbridge.  No deal to renegotiate because we were never apart of it to begin with.

Your version of property rights, does that give people the right to execute oil exec's over thievery such as stolen land?
2984 2018-02-13 18:00:23 Huh, I see. Why is Canada insulated from the effects the financial crisis? I would've thought that the drop in oil prices would have a significant impact, at least in Alberta and other oil exporting areas of Canada.
2985 2018-02-13 18:00:17 Diamonds are made from coal.
Coal is made from oil.
Diesel is also made from oil.

For Valentines, rather than a $600 diamond necklace get your girl 200 gallons of diesel.

It’s basically the same thing and it’s actually a useful product.
2986 2018-02-13 18:00:15 Off the top of my head it is clove bud oil, eucalyptus oil, cinnamon bark oil, rosemary oil and lemon oil. I add 5 drops of oregano oil to mine. It's an anti microbial, anti fungus and anti bacterial.

2994 2018-02-13 17:58:34 Maybe explain that the money the UKParties give to Scotland has been cut by the UK CONServatives + UKLabour.

2998 2018-02-13 17:58:20 What will happen eventually is the price of oil will collapse due to electrification of transit.  Natural gas will become the dominant hydrocarbon because it requires least refining.  For countries without cheap gas, competition btwn. coal gasification and oil refining/reforming.

3011 2018-02-13 17:56:58 Every country on Earth has been “pillaged” by the US via the Breton Woods Agreement.

3026 2018-02-13 17:55:21 I agree, Aboud. It is the worst of both worlds for Syrian people: Assad dictatorship & American sanctions and blockade on trade, oil, & agriculture by promoting Kurdish nationalism. Hopefully good for Kurds if US stays for long haul. Some Syrians benefit.

3042 2018-02-13 17:54:08 the reality is that without their luck in oil and western companies drilling it for them or selling them tech/expertise, they'd be total backwater much worse than other Arab countries (their status before oil). And alternatives to oil are coming up

3050 2018-02-13 17:52:29 .@realDonaldTrump’s #TaxScam made Big Oil billions $ richer, while preserving $14 billion in fossil fuel taxpayer handouts. Now he’s aiming to grease the wheels for more Oil & Gas in his #InfrastructureScam. We say No Way!
3051 2018-02-13 17:52:24 Most of the refined products we consume come from AB through the existing TM pipeline. Also, up to 1/4 of the oil refined in WA comes from AB via TM.
3052 2018-02-13 17:52:12 I don't know why, our first pancake is always bad. Maybe because the pan has too much oil? I can't explain it.
3053 2018-02-13 17:52:10 The current price of Heating Oil is $2.199 per gallon.
3054 2018-02-13 17:51:58 Dont worry about us, our income from our  exportation of olive oil last  year is more than the income of Tourism industry. Best of luck to us with all the opportunity we have in my beautiful country. GOD Protect Tunisia

3057 2018-02-13 17:51:17 Transmutation:

•Grapes must be
crushed to make wine

•Diamonds form
under pressure

•Olives are pressed to
release oil

•Seeds grow in
darkness

Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed, or in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation/transmutation.

3092 2018-02-13 17:46:43 yes higher oil prices always good for OPEC, Russia and Venezuela.  Takes money from US consumers and puts it into oil producers pocket but then oil prices have fallen 12% in last 10 days...
3093 2018-02-13 17:46:26 The best way to rid us of anything is to start to understand human psychology. The origins of love and hate is a good place to begin... It's always good to own our own behaviours. We sell arms, enter countries for oil etc. Under pretence of care!!!

3110 2018-02-13 17:44:35 No, the EPA and Obama Policy of continuing to require New Reports as soon as they came out and he didn't like them. Trump stopped that nonsense and got it going. It didn't even go on their land and that's why they were really protesting. They wanted oil royalties. #MAGA!
3111 2018-02-13 17:44:29 Oh yah, agreed. I definitely do not support the continued push of dependence on oil. Nothing good has or will come out of this.

3191 2018-02-13 17:34:54 I really need to get my ears & throat checked out before i fly again . I always get the WORST pain . It’s like someone is stabbing my ear drums & pouring hot oil down my throat.

3193 2018-02-13 17:34:38 Oil is the elixir of life
3194 2018-02-13 17:34:36 Not sure what to do with all that leftover oil after cooking or frying? The Public Works Department collects used oil and will also provide a funnel to help transfer the cooking oil! For more info, call 972.564.7339.
3195 2018-02-13 17:34:31 Sally Hansen hard as nails. Also are you applying vit e oil to your cuticles?
3196 2018-02-13 17:34:25 I wish all the oil drys up,tuone again if US will be interested in Kenya.
3197 2018-02-13 17:34:18 I really hope that castor oil doesn’t leave your system 
3198 2018-02-13 17:34:17 L'Aie avverte: il boom dello shale oil ricorda quello che ha portato al crollo dei prezzi del barile nel 2014

3200 2018-02-13 17:33:44 @GunnelsWarren Can y'all do one of these with Canadian businessmen talking about how helpful their single-payer system is for business?  I had a conversation in 2006 with a Canadian "oil man".  I expected him to be for free-market healthcare.  Turns out he praised single-payer.
3201 2018-02-13 17:33:42 Yes after oil etc is extracted for human use
3202 2018-02-13 17:33:42 Oil? Military base?
3203 2018-02-13 17:33:32 Someone: “Oh wow, I love the wet hair look today.” 

Me: “Actually I put coconut oil in my hair last night and then woke up late this morning so I didn’t have time to wash it out of my hair...”

Also me: “My hair freezes every time I walk somewhere lower than 76 degrees.” 
3204 2018-02-13 17:33:28 Been at meineke for about a half hour now tryna get my oil changed and I haven’t even been helped yet 
3205 2018-02-13 17:33:22 He probably ruined his suit with a big oil stain on the left side
3206 2018-02-13 17:33:12 Anything for oil money. The whole presidency and everything surrounding it is about OIL MONEY.
3207 2018-02-13 17:33:04 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
3208 2018-02-13 17:32:53 Me too. It's my fave vegetable. Saute it with some olive oil and garlic and it's all you need
3209 2018-02-13 17:32:52 OPEC decided to cut oil production while Obama was still in office. This doesn't have anything to do with who's in the @WhiteHouse and much to do with supply/demand.
3210 2018-02-13 17:32:46 Can you admit that you can't solve this? Wine, oil pipelines, racism, land appropriation, cultural genocide, housing affordability, hydroelectric projects, homelessness, US military and economic incursions into foreign lands, theocratic authoritarians, and AI are #interconnected.
3211 2018-02-13 17:32:41 In the past the US Dollar was universal currency used by most nations to pay/purchase among each other. Especially oil, the US $ was the only currency accepted by oil producing nations. China now pushing yuan and it's accepted by many nations. Soon offer Chinese bonds to compete.
3212 2018-02-13 17:32:28 "The previous administration scorned domestic energy development and crafted the prior rule to deliberately stifle it." So says Rob Bishop, who received over 90% of his campaign contributions from outside of Utah, most from the oil and gas industry and agribusiness. Yeah. #lies
3213 2018-02-13 17:31:49 Bloodbath for some oil / gas E&Ps over the past few months. I sold out of all my holdings in the sector in '16 and '17, but plunging prices do intrigue me.
3214 2018-02-13 17:31:45 Aly Raisman is so pretty. 
3215 2018-02-13 17:31:42 Strange painting all the way around. It looks ghetto next to past Presidents portraits. I oil paint and no doubt could have done better.
3216 2018-02-13 17:31:25 Oil & Water Dont Mix 
3217 2018-02-13 17:31:25 I dont disagree. But point is final displacement is > 0 and < 1 barrel per barrel of EOR crude. What kind of oil displaced also matters a lot ur to different ghg intensities of different oils. This is an empirical question well worth study but neither of us seem to have answers
3218 2018-02-13 17:31:20 Lol it was just a suggestion. They taste way better than that oil thing.
3219 2018-02-13 17:31:10 Good luck! And don't hold back. Let LOOSE on your canvas. Commitment and emotion REALLY comes through in oil.
3220 2018-02-13 17:31:09 Throw some henna, rosemary oil and carrier oil of your choice in a bottle let it sit for a couple of days. Strain it and ya edges gon flourish 
3221 2018-02-13 17:31:02 How about the entire middle of the US that has had their water supply poisoned by fracking for oil? That is millions of American lives now either tainted or destroyed, just so the US could get more oil out of the ground  Our government is doing a bang up job.
3222 2018-02-13 17:30:55 I’m getting my oil changed over a thousand miles late... but it’s only been a week and a half since it was due...
3223 2018-02-13 17:30:40 I just ingested 3 drops of oregano oil as a precaution.
3224 2018-02-13 17:30:36 How about working on DECA. Tired of you and EMPEROR TRUMP and The  WHOLE $70  A MONTH I GOT. BIG OIL USED THEIR BREAK ON RAISING GAS PRICES. THANKS OK HMM PUPPET MAN OF TRUMP
3225 2018-02-13 17:30:31 If you *really* want, you can buy expensive body wash, butt firming creams, lotions. supposedly, separate products are needed due to skin variation (thickness, sun exposure, hair follicle density, oil production, makeup usage). Probs mostly just marketing tho
3226 2018-02-13 17:30:30 Shepherd’s Purse has to be the most disgusting oil I put near my mouth/nose.
3227 2018-02-13 17:30:28 He's confused. Trump is the viscous one. It comes with selling all that snake oil.
3228 2018-02-13 17:30:24 Since @SpeakerMcCall says there is no Plan B for the #stepup Plan, I'd like to propose our own Plan B, called the FedUp Plan, which is to vote out McCall and other Big Oil puppets. #FedUpPlan #okleg #OklaEd
3229 2018-02-13 17:29:42 Cannabis oil doesn't destroy cancer cells you fucking pot head cunts! It helps with inflammation. That's it. Stop using cancer for leverage
3230 2018-02-13 17:29:37 Thank you! I've actually been wanting to get into oil in the summer! :'D I'm glad to hear that it would compliment my art style.
3231 2018-02-13 17:29:37 Hand lotion is good enough for oil spills
3232 2018-02-13 17:29:35 Big ups pouring all that oil out like that  health is wealth and i need my bag @MozzyThaMotive
3233 2018-02-13 17:29:33 If there is a crisis in US nobody bothers but when there is hike in price of the crude oil in the NYSE whole world cries.Therefore, we should be more concerned about the stability of the US economy than our own economies .
3234 2018-02-13 17:29:33 I couldn't find that info. She owns a farm, is very concerned about oil and gas drilling, & running for office as a Dem. The article said she appeared on her own & was listing the donations Republican members had taken from the #OilAndGas #FossilFuels industry. Kudos to Ms Lucas!

3241 2018-02-13 17:28:42 I kinda agree with his agenda; he wants to stop America from bombing babies for oil, and from becoming a police state.
3242 2018-02-13 17:28:33 Heck, I like them smoked with olive oil and some sea salt on them. YUMMY!

3246 2018-02-13 17:28:12 Ok I just bought some of their products because I’ve been looking for stuff for sensitive combination/oily skin and their “oil free” moisturizer made me feel DISGUSTING. My cheeks are NEVER oily and it made them feel gross
3247 2018-02-13 17:28:05 Chilli  Oil if you want to really hot night 
3248 2018-02-13 17:28:04 Omgosh PF Chang got pepper oil . I would eat cilantro doused in that
3249 2018-02-13 17:28:03 Trump needs a few drops of oil in his coffee on a regular basis; something to open him up to greater depths of consciousness; not diet little kid poison soda.

3251 2018-02-13 17:27:55 of course..that is why the US intervened  in Rwanda to stop the ethnic cleansing of the Hutu tribe there..(ths US should have) there was nothing to be gained there..while in the middle east..oil has to flow smoothly:)
3252 2018-02-13 17:27:43 keeps me a bottle of baby oil in the cut 
3253 2018-02-13 17:27:43 The subject is property owner rights.  And what a property owner can do on their own lands.

For example, when Kinder Morgan pipeline annexes lands.  Your saying land owners have the right to execute oil executives and pipeline workers?  Because thievery is wrong.
3254 2018-02-13 17:27:39 Your style seems like oil would complement it quite a bit and give you more range and depth. You should give it a try if you get the chance

Very nice work btw. Keep it up!
3255 2018-02-13 17:27:26 It worked, but only if your goal was "suck all of the oil out of your skin so it's a dry, shriveled-up spot instead of a regular pimple"
3256 2018-02-13 17:27:22 What I do is heat the pan to v v hot - then roll a ball of tough kitchen roll if you don't have a butter brush and take some butter just to brush round the pan - - pancake should swim in oil

3258 2018-02-13 17:27:16 This is true for pretty much anyone. Ask any diet organization. It's a strongly held belief on chips vs lettuce, but it's not accurate. Try it out before you judge!!! 

Or add a little low nutrient cheap tasty oil to that lettuce, same calories but huge difference.
3259 2018-02-13 17:27:16 That is, does a barrel of oil from US EOR displace a barrel of Canadian tar sands? Venezuelan heavy crude? Saudi light? Makes big difference to final net CO2 calculus. So let's avoid sweeping generalizations. Could be net positive or negative. It depends.
3260 2018-02-13 17:27:14 Never use oil, but tbf I use Aunt Jemima mix.  that’s cheating but tastes amazing.
3261 2018-02-13 17:27:11 If Slayz is a tater, then I’m just the oil you fry the taters in

3263 2018-02-13 17:27:08 I seriously get so excited when my stuff comes from Amazon...even if it’s only my dogs fish oil pills 
3264 2018-02-13 17:26:57 “Reads like an attack”? Of course it is. The Luddites have control of both Houses and the president is an antediluvian charlatan selling snake oil. When are we going to wake up from the nightmare?
3265 2018-02-13 17:26:56 If people want to drain the swamp they can start with draining Big Oil out of Scott Pruitt’s ass. #EPA #Scott Pruitt
3266 2018-02-13 17:26:44 Less water usage, more olive oil... not a bad trade
3267 2018-02-13 17:26:42 Told her to keep her remarks "to the bill." But knowing about the donors of the voting members is pertinent to bill discussion- When those members are propped up by oil/gas industries, and bill is about reducing percentage of landowners required to agree to private co. drilling.
3268 2018-02-13 17:26:25 The short term climate impact of EOR is likely to be pretty marginal. But it's hard to generalize as it depends on both the geology of the specific oil field (eg barrels per ton of CO2) and what kind of oil is displaced on the margins of the global oil market...

3278 2018-02-13 17:24:30 Ngcono neBaby oil 
3279 2018-02-13 17:24:30 Oil prices predicted to go down again          yep stocks are down oil goes down look on the bright side
3280 2018-02-13 17:24:07 The implication that we have to choose between two kinds of oil spill disasters is a perfect example of a false dichotomy. Renewables are growing exponentially, individuals, pensions, whole countries are divesting from dirty energy, and we're putting pristine coast in danger why?
3281 2018-02-13 17:24:02 Man, the alberta NDP govt really wants this pipeline built into BC so the oil patch workers can afford their meth.
3282 2018-02-13 17:23:32 Oklahoma should raise taxes on the rich and on corporations, especially the oil and gas industry.
3283 2018-02-13 17:23:28 grateful ion gotta pay for my oil changes but lowkey irks me that they all call me princess

3285 2018-02-13 17:23:26 Same easing we still rely on oil!!!!
3286 2018-02-13 17:22:59 By "fight for AB" you mean fight for big oil corporations. You seem to equate the two.  Have you at all considered diversifying the economy instead just continually screaming "MORE OIL" from the rooftops?
3287 2018-02-13 17:22:52 You’ll need 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and cook, stirring constantly whisking.
3288 2018-02-13 17:22:50 Went in Walmart and CVS looking for Baby Oil and people keep telling me baby oil sales out fast for Valentine's day lol. I guess I got to go store hopping for Baby Oil.
3289 2018-02-13 17:22:43 Well great powers don't get involved in international conflicts for moral reasons. They do it for their own interests (which can be complicated, and can change at any moment). We must keep this in mind.
3290 2018-02-13 17:22:41 Lena, while riding home in the car with her newborn triplets: "Olie, do you remember that time we ran out of the K-Y and had to use Three-In-One oil?"
Olie: Ya, I remember.
Lena: "Well, I'm sure glad we didn't use that WD-40."

3292 2018-02-13 17:22:39 It's not a republican thing to do but we should rebuild the strategic oil reserve to hold 1 year of oil. Put ourselves on a solid footing.
3293 2018-02-13 17:22:37 I chopped the weed and fried it in olive oil, then mixed in a bar of milk chocolate. Cooked it good and set it out in the snow to cool. Just busted the caramelized O.G. Kuchocolate out of the pan, and stored it. I just licked the spoon and now I am completely fucked up again.

3299 2018-02-13 17:21:49 Why did the teacher raise bill not pass? They are the most important resource we have in this state. Not oil, not natural gas, not wind, it's only teachers. They dictate the future because our kids are our future.
3300 2018-02-13 17:21:49 I'm reading American Theocracy by Kevin Phillips right now - tracing oil, religion through US history
3301 2018-02-13 17:21:32 Thievery is thievery though.  If your property is being stolen by oil companies, people have the right to protect their properties and execute armed thugs no matter the uniform?

If pipeline workers contribute to destroying and thieving your lands, people can execute them right?
3302 2018-02-13 17:21:28  I love your buffalo chicken dip bby so I’m happy you’re ditching palm oil
3303 2018-02-13 17:21:26 Canada is the largest exporter of oil to the U.S. yet gas in Canada is 30% more than the U.S. Just one example of taxes for free rationed healthcare .

3306 2018-02-13 17:20:52 No other oil producing country , unlike Canada, would strangle its own energy industry to allow 700k barrels from Saudi, etc to be imported daily.

3327 2018-02-13 17:19:14 Pesky russians shouldnt have been there..... Oh wait.... The US is the country that is in Syria without authorization, fighting an enemy that we supply, over an oil dispute. (Go figure) @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump

3329 2018-02-13 17:19:10 but i dont have any olive oil
3330 2018-02-13 17:18:48 I love cold noodles with sesame oil but am not that fond of the combo hot so I will make it simply to be eaten as leftovers.
3331 2018-02-13 17:18:29 Getting my oil changed and in the waiting room listening to the sounds of Fox News... Taking it as an opportunity to learn about messaging techniques.
3332 2018-02-13 17:18:21 But Scott Pruitt could still travel first class and Trump can still fly to his Florida estate every weekend to golf and watch TV in his palace and the oil and gas barons, the Koch brothers, still have extra millions in tax relief to buy more politicians...welcome to Trumplandia.
3333 2018-02-13 17:18:20 Time to get my oil changed. 4,000 miles later 
3334 2018-02-13 17:18:15 look at this oil spill of a mess I’ve gotten myself into 
3335 2018-02-13 17:18:13 Just another case where Russia has stepped in on behalf of big oil.
3336 2018-02-13 17:18:13 Coconut oil.
3337 2018-02-13 17:17:59 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "How to paint realistic trees in three easy steps | Oil painting tutorial" à l'adresse
3338 2018-02-13 17:17:55 Is it all the people who moved there for the oil boom?
3339 2018-02-13 17:17:46 I do it a lot. Oil hard to get out. Dawn will work though has good surfactants
3340 2018-02-13 17:17:33 I want to earn more money............  And I want lots of holidays.....  
Unfortunately I am not rich.... 
And these two things exclude each other.....
Except if I were to become a fluid engineer on an oil rig in Norway....
3341 2018-02-13 17:17:26 Lmao “and why?” Got me  word I feel you tho, you know we adults anyways pretty much gotta keep the pre-rolls on deck like ciggs, that or the thc oil pens
3342 2018-02-13 17:17:25 I lived in Santa Barbara at the time of their oil spill, that is how so?
3343 2018-02-13 17:17:24 You can keep your opinion that the City of Vancouver should be responsible for oil spill response.  Since the Feds have said they are responsible for waterways and will provide a “world class response” to spills and therefore collect a majority of tax dollars, you are wrong.
3344 2018-02-13 17:17:06 Whatever may be oil scenario, world should move to electric vehicles for the sake of environment
3345 2018-02-13 17:16:46 started taking mct oil today hope it doesn't make me poop a bunch

3349 2018-02-13 17:16:19 Yes I meant to add that, because I actually use them to remove my make up...so saves me on my cleansing oil as well. They're so good!!
3350 2018-02-13 17:16:18 I need an oil change badly
3351 2018-02-13 17:16:01 อยากได้ 03 ค่าา หาซื้อลิปรุ่นนี้ไม่ได้เลย ไปทุกครั้งของก็หมดทุกครั้ง งื้ออออ ขอให้ได้ขอให้โดน
3352 2018-02-13 17:15:54 —on the day610topped upVLE sub £9 & cleared out the last of the overhang as it then popped 4%HUR-4% spoilt the day as oil price wobbles, I fought hard to keep the rest of cash hoard as SDI was giving me the glad , I intend to put it into a megcap high yielder ..soon
3353 2018-02-13 17:15:52 GST will replace VAT, excise duty on crude oil: Pradhan
3354 2018-02-13 17:15:50 It’s a very aggressive email....doing a great job of dismantling the ‘oil of goodwill’ without which the university system would fail. For the first time for ages I feel like rejoining UCU.
3355 2018-02-13 17:15:09 I love oil paint, but I don't have the patience .
3356 2018-02-13 17:15:03 Oh my god.  Probably like, a 10-foot-tall oil painting of my fursona dressed in a gorgeous ballgown, wielding a flaming sword, and riding Mechagodzilla. Solid gold frame.
3357 2018-02-13 17:14:21 But to your point Bush should have never gone to Iraq and Reagan and the Russians should never have got involved in a proxy war in Afghanistan...it is like colin powell said. once to bush before going into iraq... you break it..you own it
3358 2018-02-13 17:14:16 Have through Thanks for liking my tweet virgin olive oil
3359 2018-02-13 17:14:15 Three words. ‘BIG OIL COMPANIES’
3360 2018-02-13 17:14:09 Well, great job, it looks like oil on canvas!! ;-)
3361 2018-02-13 17:14:07 Funny how right wing nuts think calling people "arrogant" is a polite way of starting a "conversation". I thought Canadians were polite? Maybe the western ones lost their manners mingling with gun nuts and sniffing too much oil.
3362 2018-02-13 17:13:51 I love putting on coconut oil or baby oil until my clothes get a stain 
3363 2018-02-13 17:13:45 #Albertans are weird. We want cheap gas and expensive oil, and it's the government's fault that this is impossible. 
3364 2018-02-13 17:13:42 When u at work hitting your oil pen in the bathroom and u come out like Hi everyone 
3365 2018-02-13 17:13:35 All the best, you three, and tons of olive oil and sushi for Anna! :-)
3366 2018-02-13 17:13:32 I always liked them - with the ‘lady bonnet’ that let you fill the screen wash or water or oil only! Keeps the punters away from the engine.
3367 2018-02-13 17:13:29 Tea Tree oil just so strong.
3368 2018-02-13 17:13:23 The whole political landscape have been corrupted by energy money. Texas Oil money, on the one side, and (green) Nuclear energy, on the other. They even own the #MSM. @ASavageNation @RealAlexJones @Dobbs #UraniumOne

3416 2018-02-13 17:12:28 I bought CBD oil for my 89 year old mom because she can't even take ibuprofen without feeling woozy because her body doesn't process meds well. The CBD has helped her knee and back pain immensely.
3417 2018-02-13 17:12:16 If you get some olive oil then you've nearly got all of the ingredients required to make most of Jamie Oliver's recipes. #JamieOliver

3421 2018-02-13 17:12:00 Ayam not understanding sef, after all the Aso ebi protests and the stop witch hunting our sister, we go bomb all the oil pipelines etc... No plea bargaining be like Salty fart..
3422 2018-02-13 17:11:52 I have to go get my oil changed but I really just want to be in bed 
3423 2018-02-13 17:11:45 This is a quote from "The Grand Chessboard " Zbigniew Brzezinski

3425 2018-02-13 17:11:40 Thankfully they are miles apart in their intentions and deeds. Boris is a backstabbing, self serving, little turd who, like Farage plays the 'common man' whilst selling the common man snake oil. He would sell his soul for the keys to number 10.
3426 2018-02-13 17:11:38 Agree..but then there is the dilemma..I don't think Obama ever wanted to get involved in Syria..he held it off for a long time..but Assad was massacring sections of his population.and let ISIS gain roots...if the stronger powers do not get involved then you have Rwanda, Bosnia
3427 2018-02-13 17:11:27 I've no doubt that there are powerful actors,  at the highest levels of our US government, who desire the downfall of American Democracy.

They aim for untold oil wealth, global power & subjugation of racial, ethnic & religious minorities.
3428 2018-02-13 17:11:16 Can we authorized the entire US coastline for off shore oil drilling?
3429 2018-02-13 17:11:14 Nieto needs to cut off Chinese from buying stolen oil, iron ore and other materials from cartels.

3431 2018-02-13 17:11:06 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
3432 2018-02-13 17:11:06 the reason antifa looks hot and ageless is bc we all soak our bandanas in a clawfoot bathtub filled with jojoba oil the night before each protest
3433 2018-02-13 17:11:06 I don’t see Cataluña as an issue as they are basing objections on the constitution which prohibits secession. Our legal position is very different. What really worries me is oil- they will fight to keep it.
3434 2018-02-13 17:11:02 Try jojoba oil too, it's amazing!
3435 2018-02-13 17:10:52 Oi! A couple of drops of vegetable oil really help the batter to spread evenly and not stick. I wouldn't dream of leaving my oil out #pancakepurist
3436 2018-02-13 17:10:46 Maybe Labour should rethink their position on independence for our oil rich nation that has to send our money south while our children starve ...controlling our own country is the only way #indyref2 #StillYes
3437 2018-02-13 17:10:31 The men at the oil change place tried to talk me into paying for oil that's twice as expensive as the one I really needed...jokes on them, I'm not your average girl, I know my stuff...

(I called my dad***) #girlpower
3438 2018-02-13 17:10:29 All of the idiots go nuts on the slick roads. The oil rises to the surface and drivers decide to speed in rainy conditions.

3441 2018-02-13 17:10:06 140 for an oil change ?! Lmao I’m just gonna switch to a Honda lol
3442 2018-02-13 17:09:41 In futures trading my FOCUS is to get 6-18 points in ES, 0.40-$1.20 in Oil and  $6-$20 in Gold on 10-25 contracts as quickly as possible in either or both directions.They travel back and forth quickly 3-4 times a day. Therefore I do not worry about Targets.Difficult 2 dtrmin also
3443 2018-02-13 17:09:39 Oil prices are expected to jump? Maybe? Sorry not sorry

3447 2018-02-13 17:09:02 mkts tend to overestimate the delta of market movements on the real economy as well.  see 16 where everyone was calling for imminent recession based on falling oil & sp.  obvious but markets much more volatile than real economy which many forget
3448 2018-02-13 17:08:55 Government advisory board are oil executives who work for the oil companies.

Building a pipeline isn't a criminal act, but you made the point of protecting your property from armed thugs.  In this case, it would be the police protecting pipeline workers who are stealing lands.

3452 2018-02-13 17:08:28 You'll still find western military forces protecting the poppy fields in Afganistan etc. Can't let new oil wars impact on the good old fashioned opium industry.

3455 2018-02-13 17:08:06 Half a million new jobs in the last two years, soaring international reputation as a high-tech hub, exported more oil last year than ever. Yeah, we're sure suffering. I think your ideology is blinding you to reality, but do carry on.
3456 2018-02-13 17:08:02 .@davidleary thank for the question on @QBOShowLive last week.  Hot oil treatments keep it super soft.  #justsayin ;)
3457 2018-02-13 17:07:49 China dominates the following industries:
Solar panels
Wind turbines
EVs
Batteries for EVs
China does NOT dominate oil and natural gas production.
Greenpeace supports the first four but opposes the last two. Is this just a coincidence? 
3458 2018-02-13 17:07:48 Oh if you didn't read the whole thing, you missed the best part. There is this plausible scenario in which Iran annexes Basra while a Mossad-Pesh commando operation brings Kirkuk oil under Israeli control.
3459 2018-02-13 17:07:41 Ofada oil? How was this made? Forgive my ignorance, please. And what health benefits does this offer?
3460 2018-02-13 17:07:38 Where's helmet man with the oil share trade update!?   Maybe he's retired after past few days... Made too much 
3461 2018-02-13 17:07:24 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.

3466 2018-02-13 17:06:24 @MountainDew is Brominated Vegetable Oil completely necessary for the production of Mountain Dew? If not, can we remove it? If so, can you explain why?
3467 2018-02-13 17:06:16 30% is significant, especially if u take into account that it the most fertile/arable land, oil deposits, water resources and dams...and blocks most of the border with Turkey (future trade)
3468 2018-02-13 17:06:13 Let's look at your agenda: Sell as much oil as possible and not give a damn for communities forced to live near your leaking pipelines, not pay for environmental damages,  and denying climate change. Sums it up?
3469 2018-02-13 17:06:11 I saw a piece about this olive oil topic on 60 minutes last year I think. Very interesting.. thanks for posting!
3470 2018-02-13 17:06:11 $1Tr in dirty RUS oil money = $100M x *10,000*
That's enough $$ to turn statesmen to treason.
Their own fams will be protected from another great depression, so NO BIGGIE.
3471 2018-02-13 17:05:58 I tried to have a bath with one of those bath oil things from Lush and it was all going well until the hot tap decided to turn into the freezing cold tap. On the plus side, I have never been so glittery.
3472 2018-02-13 17:05:14 Haha, completely agree f@&£ the nay sayers, this will be monumental #oil #ukog #broadfordbridge #horsehill #oilbritania #fuckthenaysayers #upthecoggers

3475 2018-02-13 17:04:59 I love body oil it be having you smelling extra licious.
3476 2018-02-13 17:04:58 People think that "oversupply" is a mythical non existent thing. Having lived through a global oil oversupply (look at how much is burned everyday around the world) should be clear enough to understand. Apparently numbers which take all forecasts into account are now fake $FAT
3477 2018-02-13 17:04:50 Probably just racists - like the ones you don't like appearing in the MSM, and ISIS propagandists. What worries you - that it might include snake oil grifters and gobshites?
3478 2018-02-13 17:04:43 1x banana 1x egg 30g oats add blueberries if you want really good healthy pancakes! Cool in coconut oil  xx
3479 2018-02-13 17:04:42 Exactly, support whatever you want with the money you save in taxes next year.
3480 2018-02-13 17:04:23 I'm still stunned that transgender bathrooms were ever considered a matter of debate, tbh. The push for tranny kids has also been insane, about as much sense as drinking motor oil to become a car.
3481 2018-02-13 17:03:56 Yay! New oil = new car
3482 2018-02-13 17:03:51 I love the smell of coconut, and coconut oil is amazing, but I abhor coconut on food

3487 2018-02-13 17:03:12 no, people respond to Richard Spencer, too. I'm not sure what that proves. He can be large because he is good or he can be large because he is a charlatan selling snake oil. Both are possible,
3488 2018-02-13 17:03:03 i need some oil in itty bitty !! fr
3489 2018-02-13 17:02:59 its the petrodollar, bitch. oil backs the dollar.
3490 2018-02-13 17:02:51 hmm, personally i feel like tea tree oil/toner & rose water toner works wonders but the thing that improved my skin a whole lot was cetaphil cleanser. i rarely use acne creams, acne patch tu pun i wanted to try it out for the first time so i beli masa sale haritu 
3491 2018-02-13 17:02:41 All true. But I argue that if the US and Russia (more the US) were actually forced into leaving the middle east alone, the secular independent democratic forces in the region would see an easier time battling the religious despots and dictators.
3492 2018-02-13 17:02:33 omg pls don't use canola oil! its highly toxic !!!! use extra virgin olive oil instead !!!!!

3508 2018-02-13 17:00:56 Is the first pancake greasy because of lack of heat of the pan or a surplus of oil that is soaked up by that first one to the benefit of the less greedy mouthed recipients who wait a few seconds?  Enjoy yours in any case.

3523 2018-02-13 17:00:08 Let's talk US in MENA.

Iran had a democratically elected leader, Mohammad Mossadegh, we overthrew to install a brutal tyrant to keep cheap oil flowing. I wonder if installing a fanatical religion zealot has anything to do with lack of education?

Also the CIA trained Bin Laden

Sippin' A Alcoholic Beverage  
With a Bae rubbing oil on thy backside
3528 2018-02-13 16:59:46 One thing I think we’re mostly failing to imagine / model is how EGR/EOR will be change as the incentives change from “use only as much CO2 as needed to get oil/gas up cheaply” to “inject as much CO2 as I profitably can at $30/ton”. A CO2 price improves the carbon footprint.
3529 2018-02-13 16:59:46 My last batch on the stirrer, there was some residue left in one beaker. I had just gotten the 'cleaner' unit, so I added maybe 100ml avacado oil to C60 residue and ran the cleaner for 30 minutes, & it was all dissolved. Not a clue if ratio was right.
3530 2018-02-13 16:59:10 My new thing is asking what do you need? I’d rather have something I need as a birthday or Christmas gift for example I’d say an oil change which is $35 for me. It’s not expensive and it’s something off my to do list that I don’t have to worry about.
3531 2018-02-13 16:59:06 Exfoliate once a week with a gentle exfoliantor. I use the boscia exfoliating peel gel it’s kinda pricey but I gets of dead skin and promotes healing. The Aztec clay mask has been a god send for me too, my scars and discolouration have improved so much. The teetree oil toner
3532 2018-02-13 16:59:01 Pls help since u are expert in skincare I have extreme discolouration in my inner thighs because of rubbing I am thinking of using argan oil cos of its lightening properties what other acid can i add for rapid result
3533 2018-02-13 16:58:42 yeah, but it keeps interest rates low b/c petrodollar.  see also oil grab in ME.  US shale ramp + ME grabs are desperation moves imho.

3536 2018-02-13 16:57:49 Yep, and it does so because refrigeration prevents the separation of oil which the processed food eater fraction finds disturbing. I keep my PB outside of the fridge because I hate it when it's too hard. I rather stir it up from time to time.

3548 2018-02-13 16:55:34 Vinegar is great for cleaning a vast number of things and also makes a delicious dressing for your salad when mixed with olive oil and herbs. Yummy. I pay someone to clean my toilets and I'm pretty sure she uses Clorox or some other product designed for it.

3555 2018-02-13 16:54:17 The truth behind prohibition was to stop people from making their own fuel to run their cars and tractors. Big oil had to get a foothold on supplying fuel to the public. Always follow the money.

3568 2018-02-13 16:51:56 I voted for Trump, and I don’t regret it. I didn’t vote for continuous war in Afghan or $300 billion in arms to the Saudis, but I appreciate the end of TPP, the bucking of PC culture, and backing out of the Paris Climate agreement. I didn’t vote for WW3 over Israel and Syrian oil

3575 2018-02-13 16:51:10 I believe the 2003 invasion of Iraq was vital. If the Iraqi border was strong, isis wudve never taken mosul. Without mosul, they cudnt link up oil refinery. Without those, no revenue. And no battle can survive without revenue.

3578 2018-02-13 16:50:48 You’re a troll. Lol. And you are an echo-tool for a narrative. Again, policy. Tell me how arming Ukraine, increasing US Oil production, force in Syria, and deal w Saudi helps Russia. If you can’t do that- then get the fuck outa here

If in doubt, one should look at the oil spill incident, few years back in which BP was fined huge amount

3589 2018-02-13 16:48:50 Solar, biofuel, wind, nuclear, tidal. All are far cleaner than oil. No none are ready to come online today and take over fossil fuel but to say they won't in 32 years is completely insane. Kind of like arguing for the horse drawn carriage over the automobile 100 years ago.

3609 2018-02-13 16:46:55 It's short term, but steam helps a lot to clear things up! Just lay a towel over your head over a bowl of hot water (you can add peppermint essential oil to the water to help too) and sit there until you feel like your sinuses are clear
3610 2018-02-13 16:46:54 Bought some oil control face wash earlier 
They are lying bare drinking water
Yes it helps but you need a face wash and cream that control oily skin

3616 2018-02-13 16:46:35 Tools are purposeful by definition. I think we want all tools to create transformational learning, but what is transformational about changing the oil? (Using your metaphor ;) The oil still needs changed. It is ok to use tech to do day to day learning too :) #metc18
3617 2018-02-13 16:46:26 To the extent 45Q remains niche and just subsidizes what oil firms were already doing, it will be a failure, but a fairly cheap one, with limited downside. To the extent we actually pay out new credits, we will be showing we can buy carbon capture at somewhere around ~$50/ton.
3618 2018-02-13 16:46:22 Just read an article in the WSJ stating that ~ 10% of the population of Venezuela has fled, mainly to Colombia. Wow, an oil rich country, what could possibly be wrong? Socialism! Like a mirage, beautiful from a distance, followed by a major disappointment

3629 2018-02-13 16:44:26 @ryanjespersen It boggles my mind that there are so many people in Southern Alberta (where I grew up) who blindly support Stephan in everything he says & does and attack anyone who speaks ill of him, his wife & especially his snake oil "health supplement" company! Complete joke!
3630 2018-02-13 16:44:17 I just found out this entire 200y/o, 20-unit apartment building is oil heat (except my apartment, randomly). 

I feel so bad for my landlord.
3631 2018-02-13 16:44:16 Try using the round brush and also the oil paint brush! Those are my go tos, the tech pencil for my sketching!
To blend I just colour pick until its smooth as I want!
3632 2018-02-13 16:43:43 Oooo is coconut oil good in coffee  I think of trying it every morning when I make mine but I always think it might be weird. Do you add milk and sugar too?
3633 2018-02-13 16:43:36 Huh?  I thought you didn’t believe in climate change or oil production affects on the coast?   Man you sure flip around a lot.
3634 2018-02-13 16:43:26 I'm sorry but if you're seriously suggesting that all art should be limited to traditional oil paintings then my point about you not knowing the first thing about art still stands.

3637 2018-02-13 16:43:08 And, need I remind you, Muslim countries have the majority of the oil our economy is based on? Until we decide to change the way we live, (giving up our cars & sacrifice our cushioned way of life), the US is kinda forced to adapt to them. Not the other way around.
3638 2018-02-13 16:43:04 I think fmcg will do well this year, economy seems to have turned around and most of them should be coming out of their firm specific issues, barring any wild shocks (oil/election wahala) you should be fine.
3639 2018-02-13 16:42:59 @bmangold @putinisgod $chk has same debt load as similar companies that don’t produce near the amount of oil that chk does.
3640 2018-02-13 16:42:53 By 2050 the only place relying on oil for heat and transportation will be AB. It will be like going to cuba, locked in the past. Do some research dude. Places all over the world are committing to be fossil fuel free long before 2050
3641 2018-02-13 16:42:51 Getting yelled at because my oil is like tar. Thats what happens when you drive everywhere  i promise I'll be on top of my oil changes

3643 2018-02-13 16:42:37 do any of you know what kind of lotion/oil will help a very dry rough overly sensitive face? I try to use hypoallergenic products only because I get contact dermatitis very easily
3644 2018-02-13 16:42:33 It will strengthen if base rates go up (all things being equal) but what is important is GBP/USD pair (so much is priced in dollars, not just oil but also milk apparently) and likely that Fed will put up rates too
3645 2018-02-13 16:42:23 3 months of fuel scarcity in an oil producing nation. Shame.
3646 2018-02-13 16:42:19 Will be awesome when content providers will be reimbursed for their products since those massive bandwidth sucking sites will have to pay for usage. Hard to do just on ad revenue.

3648 2018-02-13 16:41:57 It’s not just “big oil” it’s all energy interests.
3649 2018-02-13 16:41:56 Yikes I need an oil change and it’s been like 2 weeks since the light came on  I need to get it together
3650 2018-02-13 16:41:49 I guest we should work on it, it might be way better than oil.

3655 2018-02-13 16:41:08 how do i do a oil change
3656 2018-02-13 16:41:07 Here it is. I’ll give you one more shot. How does arming Ukraine, loosening oil drilling & increasing US output, a deal w Saudi, and force in Syria help Russia?
3657 2018-02-13 16:40:51 woke me up to do oil changes at work today ... couldn’t wait till it got alittle warmer
3658 2018-02-13 16:40:46 When will the U.S.A. realize we must regulate (slow) shale drilling?  Until this happens, the price is going to yo-yo up and down and never break 80$/bbl.

3666 2018-02-13 16:39:37 We have no choice we've got to drive oil down. Putin is creating chaos in the wld because he wants 100+ oil. His revenue is 80% oil 20% vodka. When i board an airplane it's either boeing or airbus not russian or shopping for a car or elctronics i don't see any from russia.

3671 2018-02-13 16:39:05 I was unclear from where specifically you thought $$ should be shaved. 

Shaving $$ from refineries exporting oil & natural gas to fund fed infrastructure is in essence an industry specific tax, actually a penalty, on a specific segment of corporate America.
3672 2018-02-13 16:38:55 i'll try that! i used to like it back when i had a much harder saddle, but it hasn't done well with my softer tack. do you use a different conditioner or do you just go straight to oil if it's dry? this saddle is very dry, so i think it'll need a lot of conditioning and oiling.
3673 2018-02-13 16:38:45 $chk IMHO this stock is highly manipulated. It does not reflect the fundamentals of oil or gas futures. It should be a long term play. That is one way of managing manipulation. In the long ru,n I believe it may be worth, not for short term. Do not use this as trading advice.
3674 2018-02-13 16:38:44 I still think sterling is 10% over-valued, and when base rate goes up, it will probably strengthen. Sterling & interest rates kept too high for City casino banking (& admittedly partly Scottish oil) has hit manufacturing.

Why using force in Syria is a threat? Why deal w Saudi =threat?

3697 2018-02-13 16:36:16 I have a staunch Rep friend , who is on the Trump train big time . She would say , "don't touch my medicare , or S.S." and of course trusted Trump when he vowed he wouldn't.  Big mistake . Trust and Trump. Oil and water. Now we all are going to suffer . I told you so .

3704 2018-02-13 16:35:38 And even when we had a deal to provide them with energy (oil, sadly) we broke it.  Without the US constantly threatening them for so many decades, they'd be a far different country.
3705 2018-02-13 16:35:38 I know, right? I had it all planned to waste half a day getting the oil changed in the company vehicle. it took 15 min. I was back to work by 9:15. Total bs.

3708 2018-02-13 16:35:24 Me neither. They provide temp relief, no permanent solutions, and a lot of times make things worse. Also, if the same people who advocate herbal/essential oil healing and no vaccines push chiropractors, I’m skeptical.
3709 2018-02-13 16:35:20 I’m speaking to Policy- policy either impacts or doesn’t impact a country. Can you explain to me how increase American outputs of oil, arming Ukraine, using force in Syria, and dealing with Saudi in ANY WAY helps Russia? In fact, it probably would make Russia want Trump out

3712 2018-02-13 16:34:56 @ProbWithPalmOil  I know it's a bit late but could we not do a campaign to get people to give up palm oil for lent.  It would raise awareness and we could rally support from religious communities who observe lent #palmoil #stopusingpalmoil #lent2018
3713 2018-02-13 16:34:29 No peanut oil here.
3714 2018-02-13 16:34:28 I don;t think it can be painted with one broad brush..there are definitely vested interests in the US who exploit the sectarian rivaries there..but for the most part the middle east has a historical baggage..some very old... from the Shia-Suni conflict, the Israeli-Palestanian...

3716 2018-02-13 16:34:11 I agree that this year is an outlier, but I also agree that last year was an outlier too. This team is right in the middle of that, and that's the problem I think. I agree that PC has some good moves under his belt w/ Oil, but his big risks have cost him, and that's a problem

3728 2018-02-13 16:32:47 Me too. However there are a number of items in their bakery section that contain palm oil. I read labels. Anything with palm oil goes back on the shelf. Hard to understand how anyone could use palm oil in their products. If more people would speak up they would have to change.
3729 2018-02-13 16:32:46 How many syllables does the word “oil” have?
3730 2018-02-13 16:32:37 He had the story from the ex-CEO from Shell (big oil company) who was at that particular meeting and told it as if it was 'his'. So he could cover up the real source since Shell obviously had interest in Russia and couldn't leak that information.

3735 2018-02-13 16:32:02 NK is a distraction from our ops in Syria, where we control 80% of the oil fields and make sure product get delivered to Israeli refineries.
3736 2018-02-13 16:32:01 the problem is we don't have much foreign currency in reserve. as we buying foreign goods pay in dollars. and is coming off the budget, not the oil revenue there for the import costing us at least 20 to 30 percent more than of what it should do
3737 2018-02-13 16:31:58 I take Evening Primrose Oil regularly as I suffer with really bad breast tenderness too...sorry TMI!  Have tried increasing the dosage the week before to see if that makes any difference, but doesn't seem to have done. XxX

•Grapes must be
crushed to make wine

•Diamonds form
under pressure

•Olives are pressed to
release oil

•Seeds grow in
darkness

Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed, or in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation/transmutation.
3751 2018-02-13 16:30:55 Basically what your saying is that anyone who steals could be executed.  Let's use land, and kinder Morgan pipeline as an example.

Your saying that people have the right to execute oil executives because they can protect themselves against thievery of their lands?

3762 2018-02-13 16:29:21 butter is a lot less vicious than olive oil
3763 2018-02-13 16:29:19 @MapleHolistics  loved your Degrease shampoo...very gentle and remove all the extra oil. Thank you.
3764 2018-02-13 16:29:09 I think we should build HSR before we consider Hyperloop. I still feel like its advocates feel like snake oil salesmen. I’m not convinced it will end up cheaper or safer.

3772 2018-02-13 16:27:59 I raised two girls by myself. No. 1, teach them skills. Change a tire, their oil, fix a toilet show them how to work a tool.

3773 2018-02-13 16:27:30 #Commodity Weekly - A great week for traders is behind, the volatility finally arrived to the commodity markets and more sectors had nice moves during this period. The biggest movers were in the Energy sector were oil and distillates joined the falling natural gas...

3775 2018-02-13 16:27:19 So you admittedly still rely on it, but you're "done with oil since 2015"?

Grow up.

3780 2018-02-13 16:26:59 The US is responsible for the lack of progress in the middle east. The US (both directly and indirectly) empowers the religious loons to the point that there are now never ending cycles of conflict where no possible outcome is an independent secular middle east.

Oil reserves are the concern of the Energy Department.

3797 2018-02-13 16:25:25 Are you kidding ? Suffices it to remember the huge oil reserve in this country to make out US interference in this thing, a decades long pattern. US has a long record of pulling the strings of terrorism all across the globe.

3802 2018-02-13 16:25:11 NSE looking rough this week, basically just moving in lock step with oil right now.
3803 2018-02-13 16:25:07 Sales was like: you either do a test for a car he/she’d like or we don’t offer anything, the promise was free maint. Oil coupon, funny she was telling me:”you’re not eligble for oil change or coupon, you’re car is not due yet” ,
3804 2018-02-13 16:25:02 I'm thinking that is the top subject by Tillerson in the ME. Dump oil onto the mkt like never seen before. @LizClaman

3808 2018-02-13 16:24:30 I’ve been leaning more towards atheism over the last number of years, but I’ve also come to feel any person or organization that tells me they have a pipeline  to a god is a snake oil salesman. Too many religions discriminate or subjugate women for my liking, anyway.

3816 2018-02-13 16:23:43 Pullback in miners and oil /gas stocks today just part of the setup. Tomorrow I expect both to turn up.  Usually see 1-2 day rally off the low.  1 day pullback (today ) then follow through up begins next day (tomorrow )

3818 2018-02-13 16:23:33 oh boy.... it takes all kinds...most likely the guy is stuck in the 60's...he needs to know that honesty does not take oil prices up..it is deception from OPEC and the Saudis:)

(But fall of rial is not to bad for government as its oil income  is in US $ while its expenditure is in Iranian rial.)
3820 2018-02-13 16:23:16 Yes! I flew on Sunday and made sure to say, "Oil Temp and Pressure are in the green and good". Instead of just saying T's and P's are good. Thanks Jason for all the great education for us GA folk.

3822 2018-02-13 16:22:57 We need a 2 prong approach; flood the mkt with oil and drive prices down to sub $10 bbl to compliment mil action and push them out.
3823 2018-02-13 16:22:57 so now you understand why we invade countries yet we might not physically consume all the oil ourselves, but subjugate their economy to serve our own?
3824 2018-02-13 16:22:54 This is a very basic lesson in corporate responsibility, but, @JustinTrudeau, the message appears to have been completely lost on you, if you insist on forcing a Texan oil pipeline across Canadian soil. These corporations bear no responsibility for Canadian citizens.

3828 2018-02-13 16:22:27 Your thinking of a regional asset.  That is effected by locational oversupply and world undersupply.  Like oil.  Undervalued in opec nations and overvalued in US.  $btc is the exact opposite of that!!!!

3841 2018-02-13 16:21:12 @GoNCTD I think the current northbound coaster is leaking a lot of oil. The tracks between old town and sorrento valley are covered with fresh oil.
3842 2018-02-13 16:21:07 India's strategic petroleum reserves in Banglore are to be filled 50% by UAE & 50% by Iran, both of whom are competitors in the international oil market.

3853 2018-02-13 16:19:30 Maybe more people in BC should educate themselves on the pipeline issue. Not just believe everything internet... We require oil and gas to run everything in this Provence. Airports, hospitals, ferries! Everything takes oil, things will grind to a stop of AB turns off the tap.
3854 2018-02-13 16:19:16 Nice!! Is it an oil on canvas?
3855 2018-02-13 16:19:13 This whole Russia debacle shows Foreign Lobbying is a grave concern.

3857 2018-02-13 16:19:12 Except I think Trudeau wants this pipeline. In the big picture this oil is is for China and it will be used as leverage for Can-China free trade deal. On the political side if this is not resolved by the next Alberta election for Notley then say hello to Kenney!
3858 2018-02-13 16:19:11 Great 4th video K!  BTW, you have a perfect radio voice. Was the left-over residue undisoved C60? If so, could you add oil to the residue and run the cleaner to make more? 2nd question, what temp did you use? I used 170 degrees.
3859 2018-02-13 16:18:56 Hi Simon. While I am in favour of the windmill in this context, I would like reassurances you won't be using to it to undercut honest, working class oil companies by providing cheap wind power generated at the festival. Thanks.

3877 2018-02-13 16:17:06 We had dozens of pieces of machinery and probably 300+ people on my land this year alone doing pipeline and utility maintenance. There is 220k acres of oil patch up hill from here.  Genetics is the only hope because we are going to get CR.
3878 2018-02-13 16:17:05 All I know about Islam is in a political context and the fact is, Wahhabism (spelled it wrong the first time oops) is a Saudi-specific Islamic movement that gained popularity in the Cold War due to the oil industry propping up the Saudi monarchy.
3879 2018-02-13 16:16:54 Adani Wilmar Limited is set to replace the packaging of its edible oil with recyclable material. The one-litre pouches of the company’s edible oil are likely to hit the market with effect from the first quarter of 2018-19.

3882 2018-02-13 16:16:03 Their excuses are getting more ridiculous. There is a tweet I made earlier this morning where a guy responded back that oil is going back up because Saudi Arabia is muslim, and muslims are honest people. I shit you not. Go and read it. Incredible.
3883 2018-02-13 16:15:54 We did have a few bumps in the road in those decades like the wage & price freeze in the early 70s, the oil embargo and Carter's incompetent handling of the Iran hostage crisis in the later 70s. But the people were mostly united then. That made a big difference.

Now we worry if Russia or China bought them.

3911 2018-02-13 16:13:24 Dear Turkey Bacon,

Dont try to pop the lil bit of oil I'm cooking you with, Im about that life way before I met you
3912 2018-02-13 16:13:21 I completely agree. When oil drops below $60, our economy takes a serious hit. I have no problem w/wind & solar, if market driven, not subsidized by govt. We have a lot of regressive taxes, like Texas driver responsibility program. Texas isn't perfect but much better than most.
3913 2018-02-13 16:13:17 I have never tried to hide all the stolen oil under his pillow.

3916 2018-02-13 16:13:10 So, millions spent to force an Oil Pipeline down the Lakota's throught and collaborating with the domestic terrorist group @TigerSwan, is a good way to spend money?
3917 2018-02-13 16:13:08 If the states go along with it. That had as much chance as selling him swampland in louisiana. States will lobby,fed end will go up. Do a gasoline tax---becomes a use tax. 10 to 20 cents a gallon. More on imported oil.

3954 2018-02-13 16:10:01 The budget has assumed avg price of 57.5$ for crude imports. I think the experts are saying comfort zone is gone. So that is why crude oil becomes a key factor this year.

4010 2018-02-13 16:03:23 Just like man city's oil money called pep? Goes both Ways... You think pep is a city for the history? 
4011 2018-02-13 16:03:21 Not sure how that answers my tweet. Also, if Canada doesn't export any oil, is world demand going to decrease, and who is going to suffer?
4012 2018-02-13 16:03:09 Here in Oklahoma, our new state tree, as my husband noticed, is the oil derrick.  We have earthquakes multiple times a day from fracking. We now deal with evolving damage to roads, bridges, and homes! Fresh water diminishing. Republicans and big business are killing us.
4013 2018-02-13 16:03:05 @pepsi you indicated on 5/5/14 that you would remove brominated vegetable oil from your products, yet I still see it listed on my @MountainDew today! What gives?
4014 2018-02-13 16:03:04 Don't know WHY. I seared the pork then the onions, and I didn't even use any water, just chicken broth, and they've all been simmering together all freaking night with garlic, green onion, sesame oil, some chile paste, tons of salt, and it tastes literally like nothing. I'm cryin
4015 2018-02-13 16:03:02 Wife: You're shirtless? 

(husband nods)

Wife: And covered in oil?

You always say I never glisten!

Wife: Listen, you never listen

Oh ...
4016 2018-02-13 16:02:58 ...Taxpayers are footing the bill for each mess - including hundreds of oil & gas wells going offline, abandoned. It is already a big cost to the Prairie provinces. BC doesn't want another expensive short-term mess, taking a majority of negative impacts, and minority of revenue!
4017 2018-02-13 16:02:57 That's not an answer. I would love a cleaner energy as well but to not extract and sell the oil we have while the whole world still uses it would be detrimental to the whole country's economy. When the need decreases, so will the production.
4018 2018-02-13 16:02:53 More calories than lettuce sure, but chips are oil. Salad dressing can be oil too (& there are cheap oils).

Empty calories are easy & reassuring. But the choices presented aren't valid to the topic. The problem is lack of affording fruits & veggies - "not those vs chips."
4019 2018-02-13 16:02:49 We were on top when you were prostituting yourself begging for cheap russian oil money - which is the only relevant factor about you.

4037 2018-02-13 16:01:28 Just emailed all my students, paid my power bill, and arranged a date for getting my oil changed. #sticky #notes lmao
4038 2018-02-13 16:01:25 Right now oil is in backwardation. it means oil 1-2 years from now is cheaper.

In contango, later dated oil is more expensive
4039 2018-02-13 16:01:21 becuse the govt officer is not eligibel
4040 2018-02-13 16:01:15 That's only true if you assume it's displacing other oil production at high rates - but if you consider the effect an input subsidy has on adding (marginally less expensive) supply to the market, that's not something we can assume.
4041 2018-02-13 16:01:07 Dammit. I was going to make a vegan thing for a party today only to discover we are out of vegetable oil.

4147 2018-02-13 15:49:54 I joined a gym & it came with one of those "health check in" meetings. The lady told me about how she gets cravings for buscuits & gravy, but makes gluten-free tortillas & coconut oil + coconut flour "gravy" and I was so sad for her.

4158 2018-02-13 15:48:57 FYI - in 1999 our ship transported North Slope Oil to China in violation of US law. N.S. Oil is to be sold domestically only. During that time Bill Clinton arranged to transfer our submarine anti cavitation screw technology to the Chinese. It made our subs invisible to an enemy.

4161 2018-02-13 15:48:32 strategy of US now is simple, if you want Syria in pieces go ahead, we can finance terror cells until last Syrian dies, and we will still hold Syrian oil fields and prevent nation to recuperate..

4175 2018-02-13 15:47:13 No I use it as a moisturizer. So basically I use it after the toner. Either when my face is damp with the liquid or I add aloe Vera and then use a few drops of the oil.

4225 2018-02-13 15:41:43 Until about 2000, no one had even looked at the emissions profile of CO2-EOR, let alone most oil. Now that we’ve learnt more, we know it is has a lower GHG footprint than almost anything else (as long as the CO2 is captured).

4261 2018-02-13 15:38:24 CB buy bonds during QE in order to artificially decrease interest rates. Increased input cost like wages without an increase in productivity causes inflation pressure just like increased oil cost.  Increasing money supply can too, its on the other side of the equation

4418 2018-02-13 15:23:45 What's new? The oil industry has been working to bugger the planet – consciously – for at least 30 years.
4419 2018-02-13 15:23:30 Carter had an entire alt energy department including teams of best & brightest. Reagan told "we the people" #oil flowed freely; fired scientists & alt energy engineers. Most were quickly hired by Germany; now almost 75% alt energy.

4429 2018-02-13 15:21:57 I'd pay good money to watch @RealDonaldTrump change out the guts in his own toilet because the water keeps running. 

I'd even pay up to 3-4 bucks to watch @RealDonaldTrump change a tire and check his own oil.
4430 2018-02-13 15:21:57 Bullshit we do. 

1. It is not 'socialism' that is causing the problem in Venezuela but rampant corruption and falling oil prices. 

2. Liberals are not socialists. We want certain parts of the economy government run, but not all of it. We back free trade and capitalism.
4431 2018-02-13 15:21:55 Miniscule. EOR from CCS is a tiny drop in a massive global oil market.

4435 2018-02-13 15:21:31 TIL: Tea tree oil bukan dari daun/pohon teh (Camellia sinensis) yang biasanya jadi minuman

"The tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia), a native of Australia, is not related botanically to Camellia sinensis."

4442 2018-02-13 15:20:55 U.S. oil output was revised upward in October and November to record levels, making up for OPEC reductions and putting pressure on prices.

4444 2018-02-13 15:20:42 After working at the Mercedes dealer PT and seeing those horror stories...I’m good. It’s no way you come in for an oil change and leave paying $1200 
4445 2018-02-13 15:20:20 Which oil helps with scaring
4446 2018-02-13 15:20:15 How prohibitive when we're pumping oil to Eldoret and Kisumu. Desalinate and pump. It's lack of priority.

4448 2018-02-13 15:20:14 So as a lot of places eat pancakes today, and the Scandinavians have their semla, I asked the Polish guys what they have to kick start lent:

“Small fish in oil, and vodka”

“What about tomorrow?” I asked

“Also vodka. No fish.”
4449 2018-02-13 15:20:12 I am not against oil either, I just like all the facts and hate misleading headlines you sexy beast.
4450 2018-02-13 15:20:02 Nice vape oil would have done the trick as well
4451 2018-02-13 15:19:43 If they are going to do it geothermal is one of the cleanest and environmentally friendly. Coal and oil will be used for many years to come and require a new market to sustain growth. As their traditional customers turn to greener options. The way of the world unfortunately.
4452 2018-02-13 15:19:38 Perfectly describes Can. Liberal/leftist "NO pipeline"elites, especially trust-fund Trudeau. SO anxious to sell Can.oil 2 r only customer, U.S. at discount prices & buy it back refined at top $. Reduce us to fuel poverty so we 'bike' everywhere. But check out HIS carbon footprint
4453 2018-02-13 15:19:31 here let me fix this headline: Oil down over having been up quite a lot and lots of longs.really, shale is just a very tired excuse.

4460 2018-02-13 15:19:11 W gutted SS for an illegitimate war and never paid it back. Over a trillion dollars for a war those conmen said "oil" would pay for.
4461 2018-02-13 15:19:10 How about inventing a car that uses no fossil fuels? Big seller!! Sick of relying on Petrol, oil.
4462 2018-02-13 15:18:44 And by the way, I’m pro oil and gas, against free handouts with out some level of service and also pro weed. So I;m right in the middle of every argument. That’s what is truly wrong with our country. It’s only one side or the other. Never the middle ground.
4463 2018-02-13 15:18:39 GST on what?Food stuffs have no GST. I buy Wheat, rice, dal, ghee, spices, salt,oil every month. No GST is charged. It is all bunkum. Done just to demonise NDA government.
4464 2018-02-13 15:18:39 Not a great article. Democrats are not a hoax. Sexual abuse is not proven (although probably true to some degree), and global warming through human means that will destroy the plant is DEFINITELY a hoax. I’m not a republican and I despise oil companies and love the environment.
4465 2018-02-13 15:18:38 If you keep reopening scars that are trying to heal, just use bio oil. It works pretty well, gradually over time  #forgiveandforget

4468 2018-02-13 15:18:15 Well then. Thank God Trump has:
Armed Ukraine
Threatened their stake in the global Crude Oil Markets
Reached agreements w Saudi which forced Russia to work w Saudi for 1st time in 3 decades
And implemented Force in Syria.

Imagine how dangerous they’d be without that..
4469 2018-02-13 15:18:04 "When Rystad applies more conservative estimates of proven oil reserves, the United States falls to fourth place, behind Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Iran with just 29 billion barrels of proved reserves" —WHOOOO HOOOO! We're in FOURTH PLACE!

4474 2018-02-13 15:17:15 Totally depends on how my hands are dirty. If oil or oil based, then soap first or it won’t work. Otherwise water first, then soap (to loosen dirt particles before bringing in the big guns)
4475 2018-02-13 15:17:08 And no one seems to really care enough to get more involved in removing Maduro. The Americans only interest is the oil. Always has been about oil regarding Venezuela.
The UN is,as always, powerless and frankly,useless in these circumstances.
Maduro must be removed.

4480 2018-02-13 15:16:41 Price of oil drifts below $60/barrel today -- indication of growing U.S. influence on market equilibrium.  Among the losers today -- Russia & Saudi Arabia.#domesticproducers
4481 2018-02-13 15:16:40 The dismantling of the @EPA is a disgrace! @ScottPruittOK has got to go! He has no interest in protecting the environment. And where does he go on these lavish taxpayer dollar's trips? No one knows? Probably meeting with gas and oil interest groups.. Sad.

4499 2018-02-13 15:15:07 I feel like it’s been a minute since I’ve gotten an oil change. I should probably handle that lol
4500 2018-02-13 15:15:05 Where do you see the oil & gas industry in 5 years time?
4501 2018-02-13 15:14:49 #Petroleum companies allowed to set prices to avoid loss #Price of agricultural produce cannot be done so#Don't hav technology to remove oil spill from ocean but have technology to extract Methane..Things happen only when corporate is interested???
4502 2018-02-13 15:14:47 I often wonder what the cat gets up to during the day when I’m usually at work. Eating the coconut oil I use on my hair, is it?
4503 2018-02-13 15:14:18 Depends, S, what if they deliver you white flour that's rancid or full of weevils & Crisco oil & Velveeta cheese w Spam? What could you make with that? Your idea of "the basics" might not be the same as theirs.
4504 2018-02-13 15:14:12 Ew! Probably tastes like crude oil.
4505 2018-02-13 15:14:04 One of few oil stocks I would buy right now is GKP, I am giving you that tip for free.
4506 2018-02-13 15:13:43 12 Quint is out of service for what the Captain described as a "major oil leak". I assume mechanical division will be responding.
4507 2018-02-13 15:13:42 Granted, geothermal is one of the best sources of sustainable energy. Far better than ones such as coal or oil. But there is still an environmental & social impact. If Bitcoin or other PoW networks are to be ubiquitous in future economies, how is this energy demand going 2 scale?
4508 2018-02-13 15:13:42 Oil companies, mining  companies, my beautiful country is an example. This is sad.

4561 2018-02-13 15:07:30 I know it’s a different subject but it feels like a lot of the US try to push the blame when something bad happens. When the oil spill happened, it was very much ‘British Petroleum’ and not just ‘BP’ in the wrong. In spite of it not being British owned for years..

4600 2018-02-13 15:03:53 I detect we have differing takes on this..I'm over simplifying but there is something disgustingly wrong about a small, oil rich nation having people sleeping in the streets.

4699 2018-02-13 14:52:24 Indian healing clay is literally life. I use it once a week. 
I use rose water daily. the Mario Bedescu brand) sometimes Apple cider vinegar as well.
I use a face wash by noxema daily.
& African black soap daily. I finish with pure tea tree oil and raw Shea butter. 
4700 2018-02-13 14:52:24 @MikeBrownDWC  I threw some coconut oil in with my @DeathWishCoffee this morning. I’m going to go run through a few walls now...backwards! #ImUp #deathwishcoffee #jiujitsufuel
4701 2018-02-13 14:52:11 So if all but 2 products meet CA standards then that's "snake oil"?...oh wait it does meet CA standards. Oh wait there is no litigation ( if so cite your source). All this is based from some guy who hates #Trump (like yourself) over @Newsweek ...so now that that's done what else?
4702 2018-02-13 14:52:10 It's actually an oil drilling rig being threatened by the Turkish navy. The EU navy can't even keep African dinghys out of their waters.
4703 2018-02-13 14:52:07 I know the study, but I don't think a global model that doesn't include a massive input subsidy - ie. expanded 45Q - can provide near enough insight into the US case. 

How much further left does $35/t subsidy shift oil supply cost curve?

4707 2018-02-13 14:51:40 2) Most oil production comes with associated production (i.e. brackish water, methane).  Methane and other <C5 are un-economical and therefore countries usually allow producers to flare them (burn) openly into the atmosphere, because tying them into production doesn't make sense.
4708 2018-02-13 14:51:33 in all honesty> if blink 182 doesnt tour in the LAST WARPED TOUR, is it worth going? And THE DESCENDANTS and MCR ?

こんばんわー 
HELLO 
สวัสดีค่ะ 
4715 2018-02-13 14:50:34 oil prices are up, grew old, their military became less effective, and why is my maid telling me new information.
4716 2018-02-13 14:50:30 #DismissMeNoLonger For miraculous medical cures discovered by a non doctor see 1990s film Alonzo's Oil. A fantastic film! The true story about a 4 year old boy who already spoke four languages,  hit by a rare neurological disorder that kills in two years, and his heroic parents!!
4717 2018-02-13 14:50:26 And sponsors do give you money. An oil company as a sponsor

4720 2018-02-13 14:50:11 For me (and this is just my family), the near constant smell of weed is a big reason we will eventually leave (and the cold wx...bad for my back.) I am hyper sensitive to smell (that's why I like the wine business) so even the vaped oil bothers me.
4721 2018-02-13 14:50:11 Oil Patch Workers and men period!!
4722 2018-02-13 14:50:05 Did they actually get this done?!! WOO HOO from the Permian Basin oil field!! I do know Trump has already rescinded all but 7 of the 200 regs Obama put on the oil industry.
4723 2018-02-13 14:50:01 When GOD breaks the cycle and your “cup” begins to run over!  HE’S anointing my head with Oil and my cup shall soon OVERFLOW!
4724 2018-02-13 14:49:45 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
4725 2018-02-13 14:49:39 Fam. I am ALREADY sipping mint tea with some of the honey and I put in another order for more olive oil and more gummies. Rough morning. 
4726 2018-02-13 14:49:28 And this is different than what's been occurring for the past 3 years how? With oil prices half of what they peaked at why is it we are paying peak prices for gasoline. Things don't add up and the people of Canada are so divided we can't unite for a common cause #GasolinePrices

Kindly recommend someone...this business is helping over 50+ families and we want to see happy faces in our company. Our turnover is$1.5M..Kindly guide.
4729 2018-02-13 14:49:15 Today be prepared for uncertainty.  Have your lamps full of oil and ready to go. Trust in God, stand at the ready, so when God calls you to action you can respond. He will be using all of us to help his kingdom.

4731 2018-02-13 14:49:06 Again we don't need to know what specific vegan diet you follow,  Whether you are a raw vegan paleo fruitarian who only eats cooked foods after 5pm or a WFPB nut free, soy free, oil free. All we need to know is that you are vegan.  Only your chef needs to know your dietary prefs.
4732 2018-02-13 14:49:06 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
4733 2018-02-13 14:49:02 Use coconut oil. Swish about a tablespoon in your mouth for about 20 minutes the spit it out and brush your teeth. It naturally removes plaque and bacteria and whitens teeth without any damage or chemical.
4734 2018-02-13 14:49:01 Not because it’s expensive and complicated, because most of the GOP is bought and paid for with oil money. @SpeakerRyan received a $500,000 pay off from the Koch brothers for the #GOPTaxScam
4735 2018-02-13 14:49:00 Put oil to Oily Head has become the philosophy of administrative hierarchy  followed by politicians

4746 2018-02-13 14:47:47 @roysj Love your bias Mr. Johnson. How it hurt to admit Jeff Sessions was correct. A major problem in the education of Slavery is destroying monuments and trying to defame people because of their beliefs. It is popular but unfortunate. And BTW, Pot oil helps, not smoking it
4747 2018-02-13 14:47:28 Had to draw the line at junji itos “oil” short — family who’s house and bodies are covered in cooking oil, boy drinks jugs of vegetable oil and then gets acne with oil popping out and let me tell you I’m gagging while typing this
4748 2018-02-13 14:47:28 Because the USA is the only oil company that owns its own army paid for by its employees.

4754 2018-02-13 14:46:40 And FYI, I've always said what I want is the end of Trident, a written constitution with guarantees over health provision, an oil fund, and referendums required to sell of state assets. All of that could be provided by the UK or though federalism.

4775 2018-02-13 14:44:27 It's not an oil pipeline. It's natural gas.

4778 2018-02-13 14:44:15 @mlofgran MSMN the oil  exploration, development and production company, announces continued  progress in respect to its USA assets, which are all generating  increasing cash flow due to production improvements, lower costs and  higher oil prices.

4781 2018-02-13 14:44:01 And now I just put cooking oil in the sink instead of soap to wash dishes, what is wrong with me 
4782 2018-02-13 14:43:57 You guys need to relax. It's NATURAL GAS, not oil. This is environmentally friendly.
4783 2018-02-13 14:43:43 Cut off oil and gas to BC.  They will care and get ride of these politicians.
4784 2018-02-13 14:43:41 That is a commercial grade oil it should use a commercial grade cleaner. We make commercial grade cleaners please check with your local service center they will have more insight on which one will fit you best.

4815 2018-02-13 14:39:51 God didn't create earth for us not to use its resources. Nowhere where in the Bible does it say thou shalt not live off of the earth. Out of curiosity though, have you given up everything in your life that consumes or is made from oil??

4822 2018-02-13 14:38:32 Important to understand the effect of heavily subsidizing an input to oil production on overall cost of production, and thus potential to induce demand. The availability of marginally cheaper oil will induce some demand; the question is, how much?
4823 2018-02-13 14:38:23 Looks like that Alien oil shit from the X-Files.

4825 2018-02-13 14:38:21 yes Corporations are sneaky & can't be trusted. When oil prices went up they raised the prices & made smaller packaging, but when oil came down they never lowered the price! Complain to the CEOS. Are you a stock holder? if so, you like their tactics of layoffs, HB1s, & offshoring

4842 2018-02-13 14:36:07 The net emissions calculations about CO2-EOR incentivized by 45Q are very sensitive to assumption about "displacement" of other oil production; this is predicated on elasticities of both supply and demand.

4847 2018-02-13 14:35:44 Same news, really. #commodities lower (#oil prices falling fast), US dollar higher and the #stockmarket watching and waiting for direction.  A double digit gainer on the open is $UA #UnderArmour which knocked earnings over the fence and is up 11%. Soft open but no real momentum.

4849 2018-02-13 14:35:31 The most incredible (and sad) thing: #Venezuela is the country with the biggest oil reserves, more than any country in the Middle East and they don't have a civil war or a militar invasion. Their only catastrophe is the socialist government.

Crude has fallen from $67 to $ 58 again but petrol pumps didn’t reduce any price. Why so? They are simply looting people and showing their profit. Shall we live here or leave?

4867 2018-02-13 14:33:22 i agree, mostly. they have oil, state funded social infrastructure second to none, and a commitment to being decent to one another since that whole Quisling thing. but it probably helps that they are a small population and have shared fish-like appearance.

4886 2018-02-13 14:31:40 Encana is not a gas stock. It’s 50% gas, 50% oil. Most of their gas production is hedged for 2018 so therefore decrease in gas prices will have a minimal impact on their cashflow

4912 2018-02-13 14:28:31 The oil industry can claim 10,000 jobs without any proof, but we have to prove every little aspect of the obvious danger of the pipeline.  Then when we do that, they say "do you drive a car?".

4918 2018-02-13 14:27:11 Because humans like wars more and since there's no alien warlords on the moon we lost interest  or maybe if there's oil  but 
4919 2018-02-13 14:27:08 Today's Tip: Keep an eye on what you fry. Heat the oil slowly to the temperature you need for frying or sautéing. If you see wisps of smoke, that’s a warning sign that the oil’s too hot. Immediately turn off the burner and/or carefully remove the pan from the burner.
4920 2018-02-13 14:27:07 That is exactly what my point is. Democrats cannot run into oil industry cities and regulate the place and not provide other jobs and industries for those employees. It would destoy the lives of millions of Americans and they would hate us.
4921 2018-02-13 14:27:05 They’ve got to quit bundling everything else with the teachers raise.  If our legislators would bring forth a pay raise strictly for teachers and NOTHING else and raise taxes to pay for it I’m all in.  If we don’t start raising the oil tax we are stupid.

4975 2018-02-13 14:21:24 I'm going to slap the next person who asks if the humidifier on my desk is an essential oil diffuser. No, it's not. Because I'm a grown fucking adult who believes that the only thing you need to add to air is a reasonable bit of moisture.

4986 2018-02-13 14:19:56 Or castor plus sunflower oil lang? Can't remember what was the recipe for normal skin. You can use grapeseed as facial oil. Search for DIY recipes, you can add a few drops of essential oils.
4987 2018-02-13 14:19:47 They could be in a much better state now though but instead of diversifying their economy, they gambled all their money on oil and allowed oligarchs to take over the country.
4988 2018-02-13 14:19:42 Right, because they are different. And it would be perfectly ethical for nations to purposely weaken their neighbors and try to topple their gov’ts for their own gain. And Israel has a right to displace and destroy the Palestinians why? And the US deserves to take Syrian oil why?
4989 2018-02-13 14:19:35 Coffey was a good hire by the Oil, they’ve clearly turned things around since then. #OldBoysClub I wonder how many offers were made last night while the 80s crew were all there celebrating an Internet poll last night. #OilersBetter

4999 2018-02-13 14:17:58 That means by 2019, we will have settled the Israel Problem... Meaning we will see a pick up of violence in Israel & its Area. This pimple has come to a head...

5041 2018-02-13 14:12:37 I would like to see you drink the contaminated water the oil wil pollute. 100 gal.of oil will render about 10000 gal of water unfit for human consumption. That is a low estimate.

5062 2018-02-13 14:10:32 This is a strange country. November 2008: satellite we built for 40 billion disappears. September 2004: Ship laden with 30,000 barrels of oil disappears August 2017: Rats chase the President out of office February 2018: Snake swallows 36 million from JAMB.

5065 2018-02-13 14:09:47 It could be sinus pressure. Try an Advil Cold & Sinus, a bottle of Coke, and some peppermint oil behind your ears. Just the oil behind your ears. Not the Coke.

5093 2018-02-13 14:06:17 I say expropriate it from the oil company’s that this war was fought for. Oh, and take a few billion more to give the many vets who thought they were actually fighting for something other then oil.

5100 2018-02-13 14:05:35 Please. The weapons and fighters for ISIS came from Libya. Israel supports ISIS in Syria, regardless of cointelpro about Egypt and the Sinai.

5106 2018-02-13 14:05:16 Reasonable????!!!! Carlos Andres Perez was democratically-elected. He, a socialist himself, had to reform the economy as a result of the decline during the '80s due to oil prices. So, it you radical leftists, coups are acceptable as long as they are led by the far-left. Sick.

5108 2018-02-13 14:05:11 Some refined oils i am not keen on such as palm oil and even coconut oil  if I'm honest.  I like olive oil though and flax seed, hemp,  avocado are all good, cardiovascular friendly plantbased oils.

5119 2018-02-13 14:03:18 Its not quite the same.. coconut milk obviously isnt as dense as the oil in MCT’s, they didnt have unsalted butter but they did use Kerrigold butter. Also they dont blend it. Its still much healthier, and more beneficial than any brew with any other milk/creamer or sugar/flavors!

5124 2018-02-13 14:03:09 We have to remember, Trump told us he was going to destroy our monuments & parks before he was elected. His voters cheered. Still, many of these very states went overwhelmingly for Trump. VOTING MATTERS. They voted to destroy all for oil/coal. Those very voters are responsible.

5127 2018-02-13 14:03:02 So oil markets are seemingly surprised that U.S. E&P ramped up production given recent price increases?  Now OPEC raises its forecast for output.  #WTI price rolling over.  The mkt fundamental is U.S. production creates an effective ceiling on prices.

5153 2018-02-13 14:00:23 It's important to remember that states can increase clean energy and can stop importing LNG but they can't shut off gas pipelines or stop gas exports. It's also important to remember that using oil for a few weeks produces fewer emissions than decades of fracked gas. @jonchesto

5181 2018-02-13 13:57:22 Hello @Scottoiler team. Simple question: is it possible to mix both oils (red & blue) ? Or should I drain the remaining red oil before fill it again with blue one ? And if yes, how ? Thanks for the support
5182 2018-02-13 13:57:16 Ah yes...farming! Another commodity we are forced to sell a certain % of to the US whether we grow enough or not thanks to #NAFTA. So they steal our oil, gas, wheat and barley. Then turn around sell us the gasoline and processed ag products back.

5242 2018-02-13 13:50:10 You may have enough oil for A journey, but do you have enough oil for THIS journey?

5247 2018-02-13 13:49:50 Ahh, rations. I didn't realize we were living in a regime. It certainly seems to be heading that way. Soon, we'll be waiting for daily instructions from the NRA, The Koch Brothers and the oil companies.

5252 2018-02-13 13:49:03 The #oil price rally has swung into reverse amid surging US Shale production.
5253 2018-02-13 13:48:52 3% UK inflation number undoubtedly high, but plenty of encouraging signs in today's data (PPI as well) of downward trends. Consideration of February dropoff in oil prices and the strengthening of sterling supports view that inflationary squeeze should soon begin to ease.

5262 2018-02-13 13:48:04 oil helps. like those places in the mall that sell oil mixed w perfume, those are stronger. and if u put a little coconut oil or olive oil on the area before spraying the perfume on it it makes it last a little longer
5263 2018-02-13 13:47:55 when i saw the fire hydrant i was half expecting the "dog" to walk over an spray oil on it.

5266 2018-02-13 13:47:27 Did IEA realize that OECD was drawing when production was up 850K/day in US? PAA says no new piepline until 2019. How is the oil going to be transported from Permian and how is NG going to be handled?

5275 2018-02-13 13:46:39 It’s great! I do it every day. I’ve tried 3 different oils: seasme, olive and coconut but I always go back to the coconut oil. It whitens your teeth, takes away sensitivity. I’ve read that it can cure receding gums, cavities and even hangovers!
5276 2018-02-13 13:46:39 More interestingly Petrol price rise locally in south Northants by @BP_plc albeit £ up vs $ and oil price falling, still trying work the maths on this one.

5285 2018-02-13 13:46:03 @CarMax is amazing! I’m here to get an oil change and they said they would run it through the car wash when they were done. I couldn’t be any happier 
5286 2018-02-13 13:45:59 Payments? You might research how much was seized from Iran as well as the 2 Banks closed in US of Iran's. Then research why the US is only in countries that have OIL. Namely the 1953 Coup. The US backs it dollar not by GOLD as before. But the Petro-Dollar.
5287 2018-02-13 13:45:57 The ol snake oil salesman trick. Why are people so scared of others getting a fair shake in life...these people who voted for him find an idea like that absolutely revolting...thats why this guy got elected.

5291 2018-02-13 13:45:32 Just so I'm perfectly clear. Oil runs into the river because the river flows through oil sands. You can see it in the banks. It's not the oil sands infrastructure that's the problem. It's the actual sand. Which, truth be told, is being cleaned by the infrastructure.
5292 2018-02-13 13:45:32 Lampu ABS ni biasanya sama ada sensor dekat tayar atau ABS module. ABS module tu control macam mana sistem braking tu berfungsi. Dia computer plus oil pump yang kawal brake oil pressure/braking power
5293 2018-02-13 13:45:32 And... we already know that it was an oil grabbing exercise. Iraqi occupation has probably cost the USA more than oil revenues. 
5294 2018-02-13 13:45:28 She's mentioned halfway through, not in depth. I always found it odd that CitizenFour would get on a nom list, let alone win. Hell, oil and gas industry tried to keep Gasland from a nom. Security state didn't bother w/CitizenFour? #FishyToMe

5308 2018-02-13 13:43:43 It's been frightening. Very very happy that you're okay. I've been doing everything I can to try to ensure I stay well. I've been avoiding crowds. Washing my hands like crazy. Taking zinc. I keep a pot on the stove with water and thieves oil in it.
5309 2018-02-13 13:43:41 Repatriate the oil. If we want to be more wealthy as a nation, like "Norway" , then let it pay for our social programs as it does in their country. Natural Resources belong to the people.
5310 2018-02-13 13:43:41 What a load of crap.  The world will move beyond oil and it's up to Canada to adapt.  A lot of countries don't want our low quality dilbit.

5322 2018-02-13 13:41:54 How “soon” do you think oil will be removed from the economy? 20, 40 years? In the mean time, what is the safest way to ship oil? BC leaders and to some extent AB as well are playing politics. Let’s b realistic, pipelines make environmental and economic sense for Canada 
5323 2018-02-13 13:41:51 Accidentally poured boiling oil over my hand and my instinct was to lick it up. I am not good in a crisis.
5324 2018-02-13 13:41:48 In retrospect, every Republican Administration has had a scandal involving another country-- with Reagan, it was Iran-Contra scandal; with the bushes, the Saudis some kind of oil Shady oil deal going on, plus Halliburton, Dick Cheney Etc.

5329 2018-02-13 13:40:57 I was questioning your reasoning behind tariffs harming the importing party , not price of olive oil , however , if tariffs are imposed on countries outside the EU , then i have to assume that olive oil is cheaper outside the EU. Otherwise no need for tariffs
5330 2018-02-13 13:40:53 If the American Citizens own it- I want it sold for mineral rights and drilled for oil!  Great idea- glad we agree!
5331 2018-02-13 13:40:41 Amazed that market has yet to cotton in the potential here. Just take a look at the imminent production figures (no Expl. risk) vs the unjustified marcap of (£7mio) & compare this to other oil minions.

5387 2018-02-13 13:33:02 “#IEA : the main message remains unchanged from last month and it is very clear: in 2018, fast rising production in non-OPEC countries, led by the US, is likely to grow by more than demand.” Meanwhile compliance reached a record high of 137%....How sustainable is this? #OOTT #Oil

5415 2018-02-13 13:29:19 The EU accounts for 69% of the worldwide priduction of olive oil and is the world biggest exporter. So somehow it seems quite succesfull. You really think the price for oil would drop outside the EU?

5425 2018-02-13 13:27:12 OPEC/KSA takes the long view. U.S. tight oil is big on rates, low on reserves. Canada is big on both w/ higher prices to attract capital to grow production. Canada = threat to OPEC that U.S. rah-rah, hubris-dominated analysts should think about instead of imaginary war on shale.
5426 2018-02-13 13:27:09 LOL! Capitalism caused the problem & it is a Global problem which needs Global action! It has begun!  World demand for oil has peaked, & is reflected in its price!

- heat up a frying pan and put a bit of oil on the pan so they don't stick

5479 2018-02-13 13:21:33 You mean the USA keeps it low and under pressure. You can blame who you want for no pipelines, but the truth is NAFTA forces us to sell our oil & gas at deep discounts to the US. They then turn around and sell it abroad. We've been dupped.

5673 2018-02-13 13:02:19 I think Trudeau has been pretty clear that he thinks Alberta oil should stay in the ground. And, if that means no jobs, no investment and no tax revenues - he doesn't care.

Crude quality is also declining this year which the IEA ignores.  The reporting from IEA must improve or disband as it is lending to a moon shot oil price in 19.

When we have land full of nutrient.
We are blessed as a Country but our problem is DAT we don't want to venture into Agriculture.
6115 2018-02-13 11:56:51 Looking at Donald Trump's Nasty Budget you’d think the big economic problem is the rich are too poor and poor are too rich. Big oil should be the first to lose entitlements; not poor, starving or sick. Corporations and the 1% have over $4 trillion in stagnant cash. Tax the rich

Instead use olive oil in salads, dip bread in quality tasty olive oil, eat nuts and avocados, peanut butter/nut pastes, hummus, etc. There are other options besides getting your fat from frying/cooking with oil.

6133 2018-02-13 11:54:18 We could get there, but not until there is broad agreement that production for sake of growing GDP is not an end in itself. It would take a mindset change. And, it’s a lot more plausible for economies that are endowed with a rich natural resource base (e.g., Alaskan oil).

6240 2018-02-13 11:36:05 Previous administrations like oil revenues, but Iran is quite clearly oppressive. I have two friends who moved from Iran to the UK because they were finding life too hard there. No, they are very much a problem. Even more so now, moving forces into Syria.
6241 2018-02-13 11:35:56 I never use olive oil because I count calories and oil is a killer. Could be something similar.

6305 2018-02-13 11:26:26 A lot of this is also consumer confidence. Under Zuma, it's been waning and now seeing renewed confidence in SA. The hope is that it doesn't falter, SARB delivers some repo drops in short-term and ideally imported inflation drops on the back of lower oil prices in future

6381 2018-02-13 11:12:37 @kateford76 you have to try marakuja oil. I discovered it on tarte at £50 a bottle!! But, loved it then I found identical product on Amazon for £5. Totally organic no parabens no animal testing. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

6385 2018-02-13 11:11:59 You don't need chapsticks, melt a bead of beeswax with a teaspoon of olive oil, in a tiny pill box, that's just as good. Tea tree oil is great disinfectant. I don't need anything Unilever sells.

6392 2018-02-13 11:10:44 No oil in Africa? Really???
The difference Africa and ME is more complex. The USA is pulled in by mujahideen of the moment or any asking for help in exchange for professed ‘friendly’ status to us.

6402 2018-02-13 11:09:14 Yes, eucalyptus oil is great for washing and cleaning. And smells so good.
6403 2018-02-13 11:09:10 After a frustrating week laying on my side after op to help the oil in my eye hold the retina in place, I can now sit up and go out - it feels so good! Sight is blurred and distorted but it’s early days and better than nothing so I’m grateful and hopeful 
6404 2018-02-13 11:08:51 If we let the actions of a few to justify closing organisations, we would close almost all overseas work - military, oil rigs, all kinds of male-dominated activities where use of prostitutes happens. Not condoning what happened or how it was handled, but aid is still valuable.

I am not prepared to answer clarifying questions.
6406 2018-02-13 11:08:42 Because "Muslims never lie", US oil production isn't real? More lunacy. Not to sound like a Trump voting racist, but with all due respect to Muslims everywhere, "Muslims don't lie" isn't true. And it's even less true for the despot government of Saudi Arabia.

6413 2018-02-13 11:06:19 Depends how safe they can make it.  In the US it has gone a long way towards making them self sufficient in oil, not needing Saudi oil, but then again, the USA is much bigger than the UK + maybe they can extract shale where there are not as many homes?

6523 2018-02-13 10:45:19 Yes, peanut oil is what I’d choose. I use Paul Prudhome’s seasoning, but you can probably find a recipe to make your own. It has to be a food that cooks quickly. Tofu would work. Sliced potatoes that are par cooked would probably be good too.
6524 2018-02-13 10:45:16 Fyi: You can make a dope natural candle out of a properly peeled orange and some olive oil.
6525 2018-02-13 10:45:10 I usually have the ingredients handy, but having just moved from a flat with a gas cooker to one with a ceramic hob which seems to be about as controllable as an oil tanker, I'm not holding out much hope for the results this year ;-)

6533 2018-02-13 10:44:22 NNPC is probably the largest oil corporation in Africa, yet it does not have a functional oil refinery. What a shame. When was the last time NNPC and it's subsidiaries were audited? I can't remember any audited account was ever made public. I believe it's time NNPC is privatised.

6537 2018-02-13 10:43:23 Yes, but the American figures are absurd. That 1973 spike includes a quarterly growth of 5% (presumably oil related?); that'd be an annualised growth of about 21.5%!

I do think a four-consecutive-quarters is a fair stat for (one measure of) annual rate though.

6660 2018-02-13 10:24:14 @CNBCWEX I'm very old 60. When I was a young fellow I remember oil being $2 a barrel. If we think about it for a min its easy to understand what happened.

6671 2018-02-13 10:22:12 Where does Iran in 1953 come under any of those? It's obvious it was done purely for the purposes of taking oil. Since mossaedgh nationalised Iran's oil sector. The USA has over 1000 military bases in the world, claiming it's not an empire is laughable.

6729 2018-02-13 10:08:00 Not necessarily.   Just oil's place and status in the commodity arena with regards to cross commodity ratios will alter.  Gold is going up at some point a lot but I have my doubts about oil.  China wants cheap oil and eventually expensive gold imo.

6731 2018-02-13 10:07:28 People, you're overthinking it. In Chile we have been doing this for decades; there's no need for the fancy stuff. French bread toast, preferably. Some olive oil, a bit of salt, put the fork to work on the avocado, spread it on freshly toasted bread. That's it.

Oil output in January fell to its lowest level in nearly 30 years, excluding a brief oil strike in 2003, according to S&P Global Platts.
The staggering decline is also forcing state-owned PDVSA to turn to ally Russia for crude for its refineries.

7747 2018-02-13 06:34:22 That's smart. I missed the downside too. Was tangled up in oil for a while. Finally paid off. I took some $UGAZ this morning. Going to buy more under $51 if it goes there.

7749 2018-02-13 06:34:04 rebuke anyone who tells you to put coconut oil on your face. you don't need that energy in your life.
7750 2018-02-13 06:33:54 I totally went to tweet at you for not answering my text but then realized I was high af and help a whole conversation with you lololol this oil knock me on my fuckin dick
7751 2018-02-13 06:33:51 1. I was on hand for the 2015 English Bay (Vancouver) diesel oil spill which was a comparatively minor spill for 2 reasons:
a. It was diesel and not dilbit
b. The spill volume was like 1% of what could happen if a tanker carrying dilbit ruptures.
What did I witness in 2015?
7752 2018-02-13 06:33:45 A car can run 300,000 miles, but you need to make repairs  to get it there!

Where is your odometer now? And when was the last time you got your oil changed?
7753 2018-02-13 06:33:23 Lol we have only 62% one of the lower. And believe me when the oil price will cut you the Arabs nation will have a higher debt too
7754 2018-02-13 06:33:20 According to your logic does it even matter?  There’s no place safe from trump and his band of nitwits who would rather exploit the environment until there’s nothing left. 
Since you brought it up, how much/many oil products go into making an iPhone? Sources?
7755 2018-02-13 06:33:18 Typical, especially since he's NOT paying 4 it. They shld check rm service & mini-bar bills 2. Pruitt feels he's entitled 2 it, but if tax $$$ r paying 4 it, he'll b accountable. 

Bet he's hitting up d oil/energy ind. lobby 4 his expenses 2, while he pontificates 4 their agendas

7759 2018-02-13 06:32:14 The Australian fans belting out Midnight Oil's "Beds Are Burning" after their snowboarder's halfpipe run are my favourite. Well done. Banger of a song.
7760 2018-02-13 06:32:10 Well they have all that oil.
7761 2018-02-13 06:31:43 Mmmhm, allat natural vitamin E. Naomi Campbell swears by sweet almond oil keeping her lookin’ like baby butt, if it wasn’t for folks nut allergies I’d put it as a main plant oil in a body moisturizer. :/

7763 2018-02-13 06:31:36 Decent? NGRns? It's likened to water & oil, they simply don't mix!

It's just sad that the right things are never done yet we expect a miracle to happen from a larger perspective. #Pitiful
7764 2018-02-13 06:31:30 Great write-up about your community’s challenges with safe drinking water / threats from oil & fracking. ThankYou for fighting!
7765 2018-02-13 06:31:21 Kim wants what South Korea has it's bad. But when American come all the way to the middle east and took their oil is OK.  I kinda like this logic.
7766 2018-02-13 06:31:06 There is a serious proposal to ban Venezuelan oil exports to the US, which would be devastating but could give the regime a scapegoat & allow Putin to step in as a "savior."

There's also debate over bringing an ICC case against Maduro.

7770 2018-02-13 06:30:35 You know Barbie, a couple days ago I read where you pretty much called all oil workers masochist and rapists. Does that count for division? How about attacking people who don’t believe in abortion, is that division? Hypocrite alert!!

7801 2018-02-13 06:22:45 According to Daily Mail the fuel increase by ERB is as a result of RISE in INTERNATIONAL OIL PRICES and DEPRECIATION OF THE KWACHA AGAINST THE US DOLLAR.

When did int'l oil prices rise? 
When did the Kwacha depreciate? Clearly ERB/gov live in a different world.

7827 2018-02-13 06:18:17 Hello @KobiKihara I love your show. My skin care routine: I use Brown sugar and honey to exfoliate and bicarbonate of soda to cleanse. I steam then use coconut oil as my moisturiser. I go the natural way. Sitatoa tint @BetterLivingKE
7828 2018-02-13 06:17:42 Because no oil will be burned if Alberta can't ship it out? What nonsense. Just as much will be burned. And it will be shipped in, instead, to the serious detriment of provincial treasuries across Canada.
7829 2018-02-13 06:17:13 When successful, the company is permitted to use the money from produced oil to recover capital and operational expenditures, known as "cost oil". The remaining money is known as "profit oil", and is split between the government and the company. @ExtraBaraza let’s discuss this

7838 2018-02-13 06:15:53 I’ve really been liking Sous vide and then seared on the stovetop. My only problem is I can’t get the cast iron skillet hot enough without it smoking a ton with olive oil, is there a better oil to cook with?  I’ve seen flaxseed to use for seasoning, is it good for cooking too?

7866 2018-02-13 06:09:17 Can’t they build like 50’ wind breaks or put everything inside a building? They did it in Dubai. Maybe we should take the oil...
7867 2018-02-13 06:09:08 Sir, have a question - did India miss a strategic opportunity of securing energy resources by not buying stakes in major oil fields over the last 3 yrs when oil prices were low?
7868 2018-02-13 06:08:47 You mean me in the streets, buddy?

7882 2018-02-13 06:05:52 An Environmental Disaster is extremely unlikely for #DGOC as well - these things produce tiny amounts per day - maybe just a small bucket of Oil. Biggest risk of spill is probably if a Truck used to take away Oil - it might crash. Won't be a big Truck.
7883 2018-02-13 06:05:51 this is something few understand, we force them to pay for oil in US dollars, this is key, without this volume, our money system would collapse. 
this petro-dollar system is what keeps our monetary system from collapse, along with the massive loans for "rebuilding"

7884 2018-02-13 06:05:50 my wife makes the best saag paneer.  The secret is marinating the paneer in spices followed by frying/browning in oil/butter, then proceeding with a recipe as normal.
7885 2018-02-13 06:05:24 Even taking the most narrow view based on Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers - yeah, I know, there are lies, damn lies, and then statistics! - there are 2.1 million directly employed by oil, gas and coal companies and in direct support or supply of their products.
7886 2018-02-13 06:05:16 It's official: The latest plan to hike taxes on Oklahomans has failed! Budgetary reform & prioritization-NOT massive tax hikes-are the answers. #HB1033 would have stunted growth by hiking taxes on fuel,tobacco,& oil/natural gas producers. #okleg #okpol
7887 2018-02-13 06:05:16 So now your an expert in the economy now....what percentage of gdp is from real estate related services....more than what oil meant to alberta....look how that turned out eventually....relying on one sector is not prudent....ask anyone in finance that.
7888 2018-02-13 06:05:06 I already got the coconut oil and the Argan oil ones and I haven’t even finished those 
7889 2018-02-13 06:04:54 My homemade lemon and aloe Vera plant scrub really exfoliates the skin and breaks down oil but most of all gets rid of dark blemish marks !!!!
7890 2018-02-13 06:04:45 The Premier is right. And frankly, the original name for those lands was "the tar sands" for a reason. The Oil industry didn't put it there. They were there. Haven't you seen the pictures of the woolly mammoths getting stuck in the tar? Artists renderings, of course. #ableg

What happens when you put the #Flames next to the oilers? Currently nothing. The oilers are booking golf times. 

The oilers new jersey is the reason for this year's failures.

7943 2018-02-13 05:55:28 With all the businesses closing, and people moving out, it will make their jobs very easy just maintaining a ghost region, while rich people who don't live here continue to "donate" to them.

7945 2018-02-13 05:54:38 Just the idiotic idea for those of us in Florida who depend on NWS to warn us of hurricanes in as much of real time as possible.  Between that and oil drilling off our coast, time to be rid of anyone who concurs with him on those issues.
7946 2018-02-13 05:54:35 Maybe to keep us all focused on this instead of his ridiculous infrastructure plan. Or the selloff of public land. Or coastal oil drilling. Or privitizing public education.

8300 2018-02-13 04:56:47 Another disappointing loss for the Oil. Pretty much sums up the season.

me:- scotts emulsion, perfumes, oil control films, neutrogena cleansers, toothbrush

lil sis:- loads of adhesive plasters, bandages and hand lotions lol
8303 2018-02-13 04:56:14 The Oil need a stud for a goaltender otherwise no playoffs next year.
8304 2018-02-13 04:56:08 Sounds good. I forgot to mention the olive oil part. The bacon sounds like a nice touch. The problem in the U.S. is most of us think of the little gnarly chunk of green leather used by restaurants as a plate garnish when we think of kale.
8305 2018-02-13 04:56:07 Does that mean their families deserve to eat more than the oil workers? Cause they invested more? If investment dollars is your argument..care to look up what how much was invested on the original red tape KM had to traverse before BC decided to break the law?
8306 2018-02-13 04:55:49 Gracias 
8307 2018-02-13 04:55:46 negotiated with who, the oil barons
8308 2018-02-13 04:55:41 What's funny is that pipelines are infinitely safer and cleaner long-term, than the rail cars hauling oil through BC right now.
8309 2018-02-13 04:55:11 Love these. Hope you decide to do in oil!

8312 2018-02-13 04:54:32 Depends on what I need to pay attention to. Tonight I focused on my eyes so I used sweet almond oil + vitamin e oil on the rest of my face
8313 2018-02-13 04:54:26 We wouldn't of been in this bad of shape if oil & gas was taxed properly. We got there bc Okies vote against their best interests. Now dems are expected to vote for horrible legislation? It's all bs that could of been avoided.
8314 2018-02-13 04:54:26 Keep your brain young with a mediterranean #diet > fish, nuts, whole grains, fruits, olive oil, veggies, small amount of red #wine.
8315 2018-02-13 04:54:25 No it’s not the officiating.  I know Oil fans have a hard time believing this but it’s a league wide issue.  Let’s not act like this is some conspiracy against the bunch of losers from northern Alberta.
8316 2018-02-13 04:54:18 Not what the girls on YouTube use it for rotfl. I use that one n the castor oil one but its like to secure twists or slick my hair into a pony kinda things

8323 2018-02-13 04:52:57 I got long today, however not staying long if drops any at all. What worries me is the warm weather and it being the by product of 10 million BPD of oil.
8324 2018-02-13 04:52:45 Anyone in oil org actually want to call it out? Nothing more in season to play for so might as well call BS when you see it.
8325 2018-02-13 04:52:42 In Brazil they sauté it in olive oil with a bit of bacon. It shrinks a lot and is delicious. Serve it with black beans and any kind of meat.
8326 2018-02-13 04:52:37 You should always keep in mind when the last time you cried was. An oil change here and there is important
8327 2018-02-13 04:52:35 My new oil is making everything smell like blueberries and I love it 
8328 2018-02-13 04:52:33 and I know it may not be easily accessible to everyone depending on where you live, but vape pens with thc oil in it aren’t too hard to come by anymore!

8333 2018-02-13 04:51:40 Rebuilding isn't a waste of money, after all we are the ones who created this mess in the Middle East. Bush probably didn't waste his money after all considering he gained massive amounts of oil from Iraq and swimming in his greedy bank of gold. You are very full of hysteria.

8336 2018-02-13 04:51:01 I still don't know what you're asking. The article you posted isn't about oil being bought by BC. And the pipeline upgrade is to ship oil to the world market. It's not for domestic use.
8337 2018-02-13 04:51:00 Weekly face mask is bentonite clay, honey and ACV.

8340 2018-02-13 04:50:03 LOL, pathetic how the @CPC_HQ and #Alberta want to use the federal government to bully BC into submission. BC has the right to stand up against Tar sands, big oil, and pipelines. Canada lost under Harper regime. #CPCBullies #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #StopKinderMorgan
8341 2018-02-13 04:49:46 The Energy Regulation Board has revised upwards fuel pump prices due to the depreciation of the Kwacha and the increase in international oil prices.
8342 2018-02-13 04:49:39 About 40% of products on supermarket shelves have it, including some shampoos just wish companies here in Australia had to label a few do but palm oil here is often labelled as vegetable oil and the vote to make labeling mandatory keeps getting delayed

8362 2018-02-13 04:46:38 Stop meddling in BC’s affairs.  Oil is a dying industry and you should focus on tech sector jobs.

8375 2018-02-13 04:45:09 How does a guy that is so disliked, dishonest, and creepy actually get elected to a public office?  Even the oil/gas guys that sent him to D.C. are stunned that they tricked enough Texans to vote for this fool.

8504 2018-02-13 04:26:55 Refining heavy oil would require a massive investment in new infrastructure that we don't have, anywhere even in Canada. Why waste billions on vertical integration on an energy source that's in decline? Also, using race in your argument is insulting. Racism needs better dialogue.

8578 2018-02-13 04:16:25 Hey #okleg, find another revenue plan. Remove oil’s gross production tax break of 2% and tax the industry at the traditional 7%. Pass the cigarette tax. Give teachers that $5k raise. Then up GPT to 10% next year & give teachers another $5k raise. Choose education over oil.

1st/Last minute goals against, something the Oil have been guilty of too much this year

8588 2018-02-13 04:14:26 So, I got a nasty jar of @KraftBrand Mayo w/Olive Oil. It's all separated and clumpy and gross. I wrote to them about it and they sent me a coupon for $1.50 off a jar! I bought a nasty jar of their product and they offer HALF OFF?

3) toner ada BHA / AHA
8594 2018-02-13 04:13:39 More of these #electricalcars on the road means higher #Electrical prices. Instead of paying higher oil prices, consumers will be paying higher electrical fees at even a greater price for Mother Nature

8602 2018-02-13 04:12:38 @newvisionwire Reported in the Oil & Gas journal that 90% of the furniture companies in Uganda were small/medium. It added that the quality of their products was low.  The quality cannot be improved unless the bottlenecks of insufficient capital, skills and markets are removed.

8606 2018-02-13 04:12:00 What’s better to make your room smell good? Candles, diffuser with essential oil, air spray? I’ve tried all 3 and my room is clean but I want to walk in smelling deliciousness
8607 2018-02-13 04:12:00 It looks délicieux.  I Will try it. Just wonder what should i replace coconut oil with..
8608 2018-02-13 04:11:42 I've been using jojoba oil on my ears for two weeks already and I notice a big difference.

8611 2018-02-13 04:11:21 So I got two matching gold rings as a gift and managed to get one stuck on my ring finger...no amount of butter, soap or oil is taking this shit off, so I guess I’m engaged
8612 2018-02-13 04:11:19 Have you tried coconut oil? It’s all natural and vegan.
8613 2018-02-13 04:11:16 When I die, bury me in delicious old fryer oil .

8619 2018-02-13 04:10:43 I can't say I've ever measured these amounts but it's about 2 oil : 1 peanut butter : .5 honey and then sriracha to taste
roast on 375 for 15 minutes maybe? But check on them before that!

8623 2018-02-13 04:10:34 Tabbouleh is a Levantine vegetarian salad made of tomatoes, finely chopped parsley, mint, bulgur, and onion, and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt.

8627 2018-02-13 04:10:17 OK so quarter your brussels sprouts.
then in a mixing bowl you whisk together some neutral oil (canola, grapeseed or similar), peanut butter, honey, and sriracha.
8628 2018-02-13 04:10:11 Okay so me and emilie  were cooking and I put oil in the pan to heat up for chicken after 10 min she puts water in the pan to see if it was hot @em_stein1
8629 2018-02-13 04:09:58 Trump will borrow money from the Russian government to fund his infrastructure development plan. He will then say "Since we've been  borrowing money from China, why can't we borrow money from Russia?" Soon the US will owe Russian oil oligarchs billions of dollars in debt.
8630 2018-02-13 04:09:49 Ohh. I tot u were talkin' abt us, planning some sessions. My bad. There's a lil misunderstanding here im sorry. Btw efficascent oil isn't edible okay?

8632 2018-02-13 04:09:07 Waterbased (tick), Low odour (tick), Non-toxic (tick). Our waterbased turps is a safe, revolutionary water based alternative to mineral turps and can remove spills from hard surfaces and clean water and oil based paints from brushes, rollers and paint pads.
8633 2018-02-13 04:08:49 Depends on what you like to believe. I’m using it because it feels nice and helps work in the face oil I use and makes me feel fancy. People say it helps with lymphatic drainage, which I know nothing about.
8634 2018-02-13 04:08:23 Think I might start painting with watercolors more often. I was always kinda sloppy with oil based paints which can mess up the detailed drawings that I like to do, but watercolor gives more leeway.
8635 2018-02-13 04:08:18 Bacon oil burns
8636 2018-02-13 04:08:16 SoCal drivers, please give extra room to motorcyclists caught out in the rain. They can't corner very fast and road paint might as well be oil slick. Totally don't accelerate to cut them off or tailgate them on a freeway off ramp.

8647 2018-02-13 04:06:23 @newvisionwire We are grateful for the Oil & Gas Journal and hope that Ugandans are paying attention to the facts. Foreign firms should not only have 70% of their employees being Ugandan, but ensure they get decent pay. Employing people is not enough, if they are underpaid.

8649 2018-02-13 04:06:21 Is there anything better than driving around jamming in a fresh clean car with new oil and rotated tires? Don’t think so.
8650 2018-02-13 04:06:12 Oil Price for Barrel is falling 1/3 when compared to UPA, but Domestic Gas Cylinder price is Rs.300 to becoming Rs.100 It is Now Rs.754. Neta thinks People are not updated, Polarize, Speak well They get voted. This is the Problem of This Nation.

Which has absolutely nothing to do with fear... unless you're an oil co mogul.
8653 2018-02-13 04:05:48 Earlier:

Rick: I liked working on that car.
Randy: Really? Even with all the oil?
Rick: I like doing things with you because you guys believe in me.
Me: There's a lot to believe in. 
Rick: No one ever did before. A year ago I was thinking of killing myself.

8654 2018-02-13 04:05:45 The Nova seems to do a good job decarbing. I've only been using about 3 years, very new, so I don't have a lot to compare to. The contained smell is great. Easy to use. I use sunflower oil with the MB machine. Seems to make a decent oil. I measure into capsules & swallow.
8655 2018-02-13 04:05:28 Why bother cutting the potato up when you can eat it whole and take a shot of hot oil?
8656 2018-02-13 04:05:27 Your regime is massively expanding the deficit. Living large on other people’s money is your second greatest talent. You First is selling toxic snake oil and $40 gimme caps to Deplorables . #MAGA

8658 2018-02-13 04:05:05 0 powerplays for the Oil, but 1 penalty shot. Worth remembering.

8663 2018-02-13 04:04:32 you just cut the green energy bill? Forcing us to use more oil? How about solar and aquatic energy productions? Off grid
8664 2018-02-13 04:04:20 The Liberals at least aspire to deliver on both oil wealth and safe water.

Now, perhaps these two goals are unattainable at once. But that is what the Liberals wish to achieve. And it puts their value system miles ahead of Jason Kenney's.
8665 2018-02-13 04:04:09 The oil may not rise much from here and the BIG BULL RUN in equity Mkt is going to start from here on especially those oil importing nations...!!! @CNBCTV18Live @ZeeBusiness
8666 2018-02-13 04:03:33 Do you guys remember the oil spill in 2010
8667 2018-02-13 04:03:30 Really? From the way you vote, looks like big oil is Alaska’s most valuable resource.
8668 2018-02-13 04:03:27 This might sound dumb BUT hear me out, is there a tanning oil for brown girls  
8669 2018-02-13 04:03:15 Coconut oil really is a blessing 
8670 2018-02-13 04:03:02 They are already doing it, we watched a show on TV yesterday where they had made a tennis shoe out of CO2, they had fuel tech in the 1950's for emission of a drop of H20, but Oil companies buried the tech.
8671 2018-02-13 04:03:00 I’m screaming! Now I DO like grape seed oil.

8718 2018-02-13 03:56:35 How about we start really taxing the American corporations that take full advantage of our natural resources, such as oil, water and lumber. how about we Jack the price of the hydro that powers most of the eastern sea board? you see where I'm going with this drumpf? #canadafirst
8719 2018-02-13 03:56:32 Yes, he was charming. And he deported more people than any other pres. Bombings? In 2016 alone, over 20K bombs. The war didn't end. Gitmo didn't close. We continued to frack, drill for oil, & build pipelines. He sold weapons to countries who used them on civilians. Bad President.

8724 2018-02-13 03:56:07 You really just have to take extra good care of your hair. Oil it or use coconut oil etc. I’ve got really dark hair and got blue streaks in my hair, and had to bleach my hair to a solid blonde to get there. .3. It didn’t fuck up my hair

8729 2018-02-13 03:54:42 Pushing a sheeple agenda, oil interest = fighting for democracy,. You’re just another garbage American who voted for trump cause he wants to end war but now you’re pushing this pro army agenda

8731 2018-02-13 03:54:33 Is it not really advisable to transfer? I want to transfer my Komeyu oil to a dropper bottle but that's because I hate Komeyu's packaging. It's inconvenient to use.

8752 2018-02-13 03:51:10 Truth hurts don’t it? Amazing what trump and his pro business agenda can do to destroy the beauty of our national parks whether decreasing their size or running pipes through them. Next oil drilling in Alaska National reserve

8775 2018-02-13 03:48:32 This stuff is fire for anyone athletic. Great for aches, pains and stiffness. Plus it's simple ingredients are essential oil and honey based. Other than this I suggest to increasingly drink water and drive on.

8785 2018-02-13 03:47:12 So do I! And I’m going through so much I honestly can’t say if the CW oil is helping/would be helping if I were not going through all this. I keep taking it, though. It’s definitely not hurting anything, except maybe my bank account.
8786 2018-02-13 03:47:04 I need more coconut oil

8795 2018-02-13 03:46:20 Yes, it seems 2nd rate to blame BC small business for this bigger political squabble. Maybe the wineries supported her. Others will now be turned off of course. It's still about protecting an environment ( higher moral ground ) versus risky oil business. $ uber alles. 
8796 2018-02-13 03:46:14 Well, our Bigly-prez had to inevitably change that, because if he doesn't, he will get charged for producing as much methane gas as entire oil field combined, right from his tummy!

8856 2018-02-13 03:39:43 Hi Tracy, so glad for this. As a former Albertan whose 3rd and 4th (I think?) gen family’s still there, I am very aware of the legacy of and the hopes for big oil’s future in Canada. But I also believe that pitting one province against another is politics not problem solving

8864 2018-02-13 03:38:35 The green energy revolution? Our energy grid was mostly green already. Every single windmill and solar power installed in Ontario is producing surplus power that costs rate payers a fortune and is sold at a loss to the USA. Kinda like Canadian oil due to lack of export access.

8963 2018-02-13 03:25:45 Moisture in the pan and in the product is what causes this. Depending on what you’re frying you may not be able to stop this but you can also limit the splash by using a smaller pan. That way more oil doesn’t have the opportunity to pop

They had a wonderful dressing made with lemon juice, olive oil, mint, kosher salt, pepper, and garlic. There were more spices but it's a secret family recipe. Have you had this dressing or make similar?
9043 2018-02-13 03:15:35 I had a version made for @iRacing. It looks amazing on PC too!

9045 2018-02-13 03:15:22 Lets apply that argument to Keystone or Kinder Morgan pipelines.  Your saying people have the right to execute thieves trying to steal people's lands?  Such as oil executives from oil companies?  Because people worked hard to own the land, and they shouldn't just allow it?

9075 2018-02-13 03:10:12 As I say, I'm not denying US funding of these groups. (Tho not all for pipelines) Just the argument that it is motivated by protectionism and desire for cheap oil rather than demonization of oil sands as "world's dirtiest oil."
9076 2018-02-13 03:10:05 If you have a pan where you can sauté them and then roast in the oven that’s the peak. I would say just use some olive oil, garlic, salt/pepper and balsamic vinegar to start.

9091 2018-02-13 03:07:05 Well, the oil industry, for example, is a net contributor to the federal coffers. They are one of the most heavily-taxed industries. If you give back much more than you get, then I wouldn't really consider that reliant.

9100 2018-02-13 03:06:18 Unfortunately there are... perhaps some apple juice, yogurt, nut butter and oil will make that prune juice go down easier.
9101 2018-02-13 03:06:11 Cube some sweet potatoes, season them however you like, put some light olive oil, and then bake for a few minutes. Almost like a somewhat decently healthy french fry... almost, but not quite.

9108 2018-02-13 03:04:33 I would prefer to see Alberta refine their oil before sending it through a pipeline.  There is good reason not to trust Kinder Morgan.  Their response to the Kalamazoo River spill is one case in point.

9132 2018-02-13 03:01:29 Good habit to break. That crap is loaded with soy protein, soy flour, and soy oil. There is a reason many Asian cultures believe soy should be consumed only in fermented form and in small amounts.

9134 2018-02-13 03:01:15 It's a good thing the majority of BC understands the risk of a oil tanker spill is minimal. Thousands of people in BC that work in the oil and gas industry don't want to see their jobs and lively hoods taken away from them by the "no" to everything crowd.

9285 2018-02-13 02:40:09 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
9286 2018-02-13 02:40:09 they have oil.
9287 2018-02-13 02:40:04 Eco styling gel has a coconut oil line 
9288 2018-02-13 02:39:57 even robots need to have their oil changed
9289 2018-02-13 02:38:53 @jdunnington @EmilyVirginOK Price indexing gross production tax.  1% 30$ & below saved the oil industry. 4% at $60, 5% at 70$, 6% at 80$, 7% at $90, 8% at $100, 9% at $110, 10% at 120 and above. Also 3% at 50$, 2% at 40$.  Pegged every January 1 and July 1 to offer predictability
9290 2018-02-13 02:38:49 Here in Canada, we are dealing with TMP, a pipeline.  The oil will be mined, no matter what.  Do we burn oil getting it to market (rail), and risk major spills, or work hard to build a safer pipe, with robust oversight?  We need to work together, or iwinner take all, lose, lose.
9291 2018-02-13 02:38:25 I’m tired of y’all thinking African Black soap, coconut oil, just drinking water  and witch hazel is the cure to acne.
9292 2018-02-13 02:38:09 ดีแล้ววว โชคดีมากอ่ะ
9293 2018-02-13 02:37:59 I miss when my dreams were like studying dolphins in Australia or being the first volunteer to live on mars now I have shitty dreams like selling tax software to oil and gas companies and lowering my car insurance to under $1000 and reducing my cholesterol
9294 2018-02-13 02:37:56 BBからのチョコだけは捨てようかな
9295 2018-02-13 02:37:42 Love tigers! Great job on the oil painting! I'm a big fan of oil painting myself.
9296 2018-02-13 02:37:41 Used my oil paints and now my room is full of toxic fumes woot i might finally die!
9297 2018-02-13 02:37:38 ตอนแรกก็แบบจะได้คืนป่าวว้าาาา. ในที่สุดก็ได้งะ มาสไทยด้วยดีใจสุด
9298 2018-02-13 02:37:23 Two figures are approaching an oil well. One of them holds a lighted torch. What are they up to? Are they going to rekindle the blaze of our love? #wernerherzogvalentines
9299 2018-02-13 02:37:16 Tony just said he’d rather eat fish oil than a brownie and I’ve never related to anything less
9300 2018-02-13 02:37:13 Not a all there teased and not matted with conditioning oil Its about time she went natural instead of straighting her hair with a weve all the time
9301 2018-02-13 02:37:02 there's never been an alternative as cheap and ready as there is now. your point is moot.. who they gonna buy from?? all those Saudi oil fields that are transitioning to renewables. get with the times. I forgive you if you are just old. but it's getting to be a pretty weak excuse
9302 2018-02-13 02:37:00 I use egg and olive oil for hair growth
9303 2018-02-13 02:36:53 I don't even know how my cat knocked over my sesame oil bottle  but he did and now my homework smells like Chinese food
9304 2018-02-13 02:36:35 What is different in taking oil and gas company donations from taking donation from electric car makers and solar energy manufacturers and installers?
9305 2018-02-13 02:36:22 Delay aging by exercising regularly.
It not only helps to lose weight but also helps to promote strength and bulk and keeps one healthy. Oil massage and exercises are a pattern followed by most of the traditional Indian yoga trainers and malla yodhas (wrestlers).
9306 2018-02-13 02:36:12 Well I start my new job in Richmond tomorrow and I drove my truck to circle d and noticed I have oil all over my motor. Can my luck get any better I stg.
9307 2018-02-13 02:36:05 want to know my secret? put dijon, balsamic vinegar, diced pickles, chili oil in ur tuna salad

9309 2018-02-13 02:35:57 おっはこんにちはー
平昌オリンピック、日本選手にメダリスト誕生の嬉しいニュースがありましたねスピードスケート高木美帆選手、フリースタイルスキーモーグル原大智選手、スキージャンプノーマルヒル高梨沙羅選手おめでとうございますっ✧*｡٩(ˊωˋ*)و✧*｡今週も頑張りましょー
9310 2018-02-13 02:35:55 Things I have forgotten at home at separate points today: my wallet, my battery for my oil pen, my car keys, and a gift for my mom.
9311 2018-02-13 02:35:54 Always. Love your coconut oil. Hubby won’t eat popcorn at the theatre anymore
9312 2018-02-13 02:35:49 Clean air and water not being a priority. Taking away large parts of national parks and fisheries to mine, frack, drill for oil and coal. Taking away clean energy incentives and programs. None of this is going to make you rich. I guess people like you just want to see it all burn
9313 2018-02-13 02:35:47 No i have actual tomatoes not cans and i have cooking spray and other alternatives to oil
9314 2018-02-13 02:35:31 How many times are the oil going to go offside or ice it!?! This is sad to watch. Look about as organized as 5th graders. #Sadfan
9315 2018-02-13 02:35:22 Rosehip oil on my face for fucking life.
9316 2018-02-13 02:35:05 gari moshi ni sababu ilitumia steam engine iliondeshwa kwa nguvu ya makaa au kuni. unless tunakubali kwamba liwe jina tu kama tunavyoita gas/petrol station/vituo vya kuuza mafuta nishati zote #{SHELI} 

Sheli inetikana na jina la kampuni ya mafuta SHELL a dutch-british oil compan
9317 2018-02-13 02:35:04 They're not too bad if you have a decent piping bag. Just pipe them out straight into the hot oil.
9318 2018-02-13 02:35:03 Bet'cha they wouldn't drag a citizen out of the chamber if that person stated which legislators received support from nurses, teachers, firefighters. It's when their oil'igarch puppetmasters are mentioned that they know it looks BAD & deem it a personal "attack." Slimeballs!
9319 2018-02-13 02:35:01 If you don’t use a tomato can & use actual tomatoes.. and if you don’t fry the pan win oil maybe try pam it shouldn’t be too bad, just limit the sodium
9320 2018-02-13 02:34:59 nothing a lil coconut oil can’t fix
9321 2018-02-13 02:34:55 Yesss. Nutox itself is a good oil cleanser tapi kena buat extra steps laa for mata
9322 2018-02-13 02:34:51 Young living tea tree oil. Seriously! 
9323 2018-02-13 02:34:43 ....get revenge on one guy)

Iraq (had the oil)

Those are just the more recent ones!
9324 2018-02-13 02:34:42 He did enough damage putting a tariff on solar panels. We’re going to get alternative energy going good here in the USA no thanks to Republicans whose pockets are lined by big oil.

9326 2018-02-13 02:34:23 India becomes regional oil  storage and trading hub. Abu Dhabi will store oil in Indian storage facility. This will help Indian Oil sector. Salute our Hon’ble PM @narendramodi Ji for his strong commitment for nation development.
9327 2018-02-13 02:34:20 Oil to tidewater is necessary and inevitable. I trust Rachel and Justin to be more environmentally cautious than conservatives
9328 2018-02-13 02:34:13 Good question.  I'd start by assuming people who follow and invest in oil share many of your concerns, but take a different view, they would consider pragmatism.  It is ok to disagree, but work towards the same end, a cleaner planet. Too many trench wars.
9329 2018-02-13 02:34:09 — hurt?

The chicken was quickly breaded and fried, a little hastily as if hoping the scent and crackle of hot oil against breaded chicken might distract her from the conversation.
9330 2018-02-13 02:33:58 i want like a cream or spray or oil for extra sticking power. also i need it for tomorrow, bad planning on my part, but it's my glitterless bed and now i must lay in it
9331 2018-02-13 02:33:55 Yes and it had a thick layer of oil on the top which made me cringe. I made a lot of peanut butter cookies with it and the flour and sugar.
9332 2018-02-13 02:33:33 Takut akan clog pores. Cleansing oil tu mmg dah dirumus khas dgn emulsifier so boleh cuci bersih lps tu. Kalau guna pure oil, takut akan tinggalkan oily residue.
9333 2018-02-13 02:33:02 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt. #Tucson
9334 2018-02-13 02:32:55 I guess doing radio play by play for the @EdmontonOilers means  to have a conversation with your colour guy about the Oil Kings, spew meaningless stats about Michigan Hockey while play is underway and you can hear the crowd going, and the puck being passed around. 

I’m out.

9336 2018-02-13 02:32:47 Agreed. This is also why free trade agreements with Europe and Pacific Rim are so important. Also exposing pipeline & oil sands protestors who are funded by US competition trying to keep  oil out of US market or export terminals.
9337 2018-02-13 02:32:32 Ha, fuck that place!  Take your kids to a national park before our current administration sells them for oil & gas drilling.
9338 2018-02-13 02:32:20 "Why hasn’t the science been done to protect the environment while bitumen is shipped? After all, both the federal and Alberta governments have known for years that they wished to ship crude oil or bitumen from the West Coast."

I literally feel like tin man with no oil
9346 2018-02-13 02:31:04 pros of getting essential oils from a trustworthy company: no synthetic components that you don't know the details of, not supporting companies that advertise with unsafe usage recommendations

cons: rose oil is $70 for 1/8oz
9347 2018-02-13 02:31:00 You know Arie has an old oil stained shirt he wears to work on cars that's older than Bekah M. #TheBachelor

9350 2018-02-13 02:30:47 Lol wtf a oil change shop commented
9351 2018-02-13 02:30:42 And there is absolutely no accountability. When people eventually see through all the bs and realise all your wars have been about oil, drugs, weapons deals and the genocide falls on your countries shoulders, soldiers dying for nothing, then you're starting to make sense
9352 2018-02-13 02:30:40 Peanut oil, one must use peanut oil. 

Unless one is allergic, which this one is not.
9353 2018-02-13 02:30:38 Clay mask, rose oil, plenty of water and some workout ended with yoga.. Good rainy morning! 
9354 2018-02-13 02:30:28 Baby oil:(((
9355 2018-02-13 02:30:16 That 's a serious stuff. You need to take care of it. Lemon, Honey and olive oil.

9362 2018-02-13 02:29:32 I try not to eat tuna from the same place I buy motor oil.  #POstables
9363 2018-02-13 02:29:21 I don’t even know what to call the kind of oil treatment I put together just now. I used coconut oil, castor oil, peppermint oil (to make it smell nice), honey, and apple cider vinegar, and then I heated everything up (double-boiler style).
9364 2018-02-13 02:29:00 I’m all seriousness I’m waiting on the court cases. This is going to force a review on hemp sourced vs marijuana sourced CBD oil. Sadly I know many who sing the benefits of both types.
9365 2018-02-13 02:28:59 Ang seasalt solution, pwede ikaw lang din magmix. You can search it on google. Panlinis yan ng pierce. Ang tea tree oil, yan ang makapaalis ng bump (especially if keloid)
9366 2018-02-13 02:28:57 ゼロを最後まで見終わったらアンリミ最終回見直してきます！あのシーンの事かな？と思ったところはありますのでしっかり見らねばですね…。
9367 2018-02-13 02:28:52 fish oil, grape seed extract and a potent anti oxidant are great for hair health
9368 2018-02-13 02:28:52 Jump starting cars in obscenely cold weather. Haven’t driven my accord in months, since the weather got nasty. Half frozen oil doesn’t want to cooperate with a running engine. It was miserable. Plus side: I discovered that the car has a pan warmer, which is not plugged in.
9369 2018-02-13 02:28:26 While you impose your belief system and social norms on others, make sure to say democracy should not spread, and it’s only for oil,... lol
9370 2018-02-13 02:28:08 Hahaha. More like you’re the Parker TRAINED by Sophie. So like, stabbing people with forks and being all: what is social norms? Snake oil? Snake kisses? Kylo Ren reptile babies?
9371 2018-02-13 02:27:05 ยังดีที่ได้เงินคืน หนูนะเคยโดนเงินก็ไม่คืน หายยยยไปเลย
9372 2018-02-13 02:26:47 Yes harga minyak malaysia ikut global price tp bukan sbb kita takde refinery. And crude oil or petroleum is a same thing. Brunei boleh jual minyak murah sbb minyak diorang subsidized, tu je. GST part, kalau government fully supervise its actually better than SST.
9373 2018-02-13 02:26:45 Already showered w vitamin e oil on my face & in bed watching my fave’s yt videos yassss gnight  @DesiPerkins @lustrelux
9374 2018-02-13 02:26:40 Depende sa bump, maybe scar yan sya because gun gigamit mo. May bump scar ako cause gun gamit ko at first but it’s starting to get smaller. Buy ka seasalt solution like H2Ocean (the best, yan gamit ng piercing places dito) and then use 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil.
9375 2018-02-13 02:26:35 I get asked abt my skin regimen a lot which is flattering but I never know what to say. I do drink 45 glasses of water a day but I’m middle eastern so I’m made 35% of oil so ya idk
9376 2018-02-13 02:26:24 This peppermint oil in my diffuser is really helping me

9379 2018-02-13 02:25:52 Someone should ask how much “Ok Wind Power” actually stays in Oklahoma, while reaping the tax benefits they claim to be against (but only for oil companies).  Just a helpful hint; Don’t lie.  I already know the answer.  
9380 2018-02-13 02:25:49 Truck lost oil pressure today! Happy Monday everyone
9381 2018-02-13 02:25:13 I agree with your intent, but only can vegetables are not good for you. High is sodium and sometimes stripped of their nutritional value. Human body needs a variety of foods.
9382 2018-02-13 02:25:08 Of course not... Chicago has the Sears Tower ( not Willis), the Standard Oil Building (not AON), the Circle Interchange (not Jane Byrne), Comiskey Park (not Guaranteed Rate or US Cellular Field).  The Hancock will always be the Hancock.

My best roast: 

1 tablespoon of olive oil
3 1/2 pounds beef chuck
2 tablespoons salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
carrots (diced)
celery (diced)
onions (diced)
1/4 cup butter
dried rosemary
9384 2018-02-13 02:24:56 The only reason anyone wants to cut heating oil assistance is to help oil companies make more money and to help landlords kick more people out of homes. This will kill people. Everywhere.
9385 2018-02-13 02:24:53 Agreed, just go back to Blackstone for now and manage more oil sands portfolios or whatever it is that you do there. I'm not saying that one day you won't be a great leader but that day isn't going to be today or tomorrow. This has been a train wreck for you. I wish you well.
9386 2018-02-13 02:24:51 Rob Porter excuse list:

Broken arm = “too much fun tennis”
Coma =“sleepy from Netflix binge watch”
Gunshot wound = “Muslim sniper”
Car explosion when started = “Went more than 3,000 miles without oil change”
Dismembered body = “misunderstanding with Ninjas”
9387 2018-02-13 02:24:49 The industry had been saying that since 2005. If we pushed for renewable energy as much as we did oil we would be much better off as a species. Non-renewable energy sources are constantly destroying habitats. So I do not think changing batteries is our biggest problem...
9388 2018-02-13 02:24:35 You remember that time we took Iraq for its oil reserves and drained it dry? Yeah, me neither.
9389 2018-02-13 02:23:58 America is just basically a subsidiary of Big PHARMA, Raytheon, Big Oil, Monsanto and WallStreet Corruption

extremely thin coats of flaxseed oil, cured outside in my new grill, repeated many times

9394 2018-02-13 02:23:24 I wonder if one of my medicines... screw it, I wonder if my THC oil would help with my brain issues today? Ima go take some drops cause at least it can’t get worse.

9397 2018-02-13 02:22:50 the fish oil has helped the pup with her dry skin... but it has also made her fur smell like fish and it’s quite unpleasant to snuggle with

9399 2018-02-13 02:22:39 Where do they sell almond oil over here?
9400 2018-02-13 02:22:31 I’m kind of awed. Also flattered that people are willing to disregard my weird sports tweets and tolerate my somewhat immature taste in literature for the oil stuff

9405 2018-02-13 02:22:03 Screw them, USA use hypotheticals, to steal Syrian oil through the YPG. All know the tunnels built with American money, French concrete, and German Engineering. How they killed defenseless women and children and made them refugees. 10% of the pop. of Syria, yet 25% country. YPG.
9406 2018-02-13 02:22:01 Ever wondered what's olive pomance oil? It is actually the olive oil taken from the olive pulp after it is pressed for the first time. Usually this oil is extracted with the help of solvents, which is why it is not branded as “olive oil”.
9407 2018-02-13 02:21:55 Wish politicians inwould stand up 4 what really matters global warming. Paris accord & scientists say we have 2 change are way thinking.Pipelines oil extraction,not substantial 4 thisSuck holing 4 votes does nothing 4 long term solution.MoveGreen Industrial economy.
9408 2018-02-13 02:21:55 The egg and oil combination apparently makes the bread crunchier, and adds a little tanginess to complement the cheese. But my childhood demands I use butter. I do use mayo to grill the insiders of hamburger buns a little.
9409 2018-02-13 02:21:30 Canola oil is GMO, it actually comes from rape seed ... it’s garbage

9418 2018-02-13 02:19:35 Oh it was just @GovRaimondo squawking about how she’s “standing up to Trump” against off shore drilling in RI. As if there is any oil there to begin with. Just another photo-op for her and the DC gang. Literally 18 people there and 12 were probably staff.

9434 2018-02-13 02:17:25 More charging stations will provide us all with more options and reduce our dependence on oil. Seems like a good idea.

9557 2018-02-13 01:58:44 we can also pretend that rich people in oil who make billions from Americans by lobbying to diminish their mineral rights and spend millions lobbying for cheaper wages really care about Americans right, they privatize the gains and pollute our land socializing losses.

"No sir, just oil and latex," I replied.

9594 2018-02-13 01:53:30 If you pick at an acne scab here’s how to stop it from scarring...

1. Neosporin for 5-10 minutes. If there’s oils, wipe and reapply. Don’t let the oils sit on your skin. 
2. Rose oil, or anything rose. Rose softens the skin and prevents it.

You’re welcome!
9595 2018-02-13 01:53:26 Salt, pepper, olive oil spray, roasted about 15 min at 375, finish on low broil to give it a little crispness up top. Amazing! Garnish with steak and potatoes.

9613 2018-02-13 01:49:35 American oil companies left them high and dry because Venezuela nationalized their oil companies, stealing $billions in equipment, nullifying contacts, and keeping all profits to prop up their Socialist utopia. Were they supposed to stay there and pump their oil for charity?
9614 2018-02-13 01:49:32 They've come to realize they have a tiger by the tail with the arrest of that girl. I'll wager they're burning lots midnight oil trying to decide what to do now.

9616 2018-02-13 01:49:11 Because we took the first horse he threatened to dump, Diamonds And Oil, but he neglected to mention the gelding. He knew he was in very bad shape and thought we wouldn't find out.  He's safe but does not have a good prognosis.
9617 2018-02-13 01:49:09 Agreed...I get the exact same impression just  based on the technicals "difficult but not impossible" regarding an upside break.  I'd say the same applies to much of the commodity complex from here especially oil.

9629 2018-02-13 01:47:02 Let me change that to: Too dense to float in water.

Now I'm wondering what the density of oil is because there are other liquids that bones would float in
9630 2018-02-13 01:47:01 I guess you don't care about the water that you need to live.  You can't drink oil.
9631 2018-02-13 01:46:34 YESSSSS I was wondering which oil would help me!
9632 2018-02-13 01:46:29 You mean the oil leak a few days ago?
9633 2018-02-13 01:46:25 Only if it smells weird. Oil will tell you when it's bad (it smells and tastes off)

9640 2018-02-13 01:45:14 Most of the time I don't follow recipes.

9681 2018-02-13 01:39:52 .@RachelNotley oh dear. too many oil fumes have entered yr synapses 

ps the old MILF ain't gonna do much for you either
9682 2018-02-13 01:39:48 Not all light oil is equal. Middle East oil flares off gas. We capture it and heat homes and cook food with it. Who is cleaner?

Light oil is good when you can get it but also has its own transportation problems. Lac Magantic was light shale oil.

There is a market for bitumen.
9683 2018-02-13 01:39:42 well...no.  In 2005 Chavez donated a million bucks to disaster relief on the gulf coast and later sent millions of barrels of heating oil to the north east U.S. because people were freezing to death.  He did not hate the U.S., he hated the government....
9684 2018-02-13 01:39:37 Excuse me but why is a major business entity rooted in large employment opportunities and support of our communities a bad thing? Does the general public understand how oil and gas supports and builds all things infrastructure and family? #Not

9689 2018-02-13 01:38:58 In Argentina, at least, it doesn't. Ranch is ranch, but it's not really mainstream (most people at home uses oil and vinegar/lemon/balsamic vinegar). You find it on supermarkets, and some places like Subway. Caesar dressing is more well known and widespread.
9690 2018-02-13 01:38:50 I love the flax seed and castor oil one so much
9691 2018-02-13 01:38:39 May olive oil ako dito iprito na natin hahahaja

9694 2018-02-13 01:37:34 I had a whole in my motor once and it leaked oil so I just put more oil it forever and I also crack the top of the radiator and that shit ran forever. It was also a Jeep.
9695 2018-02-13 01:37:32 #mepolitics but many threw that to the wolves... for short term energy policy...for negative environmental protections...remember Sarah Palin's "drill baby drill" right before the gulf oil disaster under Obama's watch?... Obama the king of fracking...When will they ever learn?
9696 2018-02-13 01:37:32 @KinderMorgan should dig in their heals & fukk over @jjhorgan & @AJWVictoriaBC until we can break that coalition's back & suck the oil dry from any & all directions & keep all coal mines open@VassyKapelos @rachelnotley @Alberta411 @BC411_ @RealJREwing @kak089 @TeamBobbyEwing

9699 2018-02-13 01:37:14  RT @blackgirlgonekb: Also if you’re trying to do a massage at least use an oil that smells good.  Jojoba oil or sweet almond oil >
9700 2018-02-13 01:37:06 Quieting dissent to protect big oil/coal while they privately encourage and profit from corruption. Classic GOP. 

Typical of many in both parties in WV.
9701 2018-02-13 01:37:03 Trains still derail at a higher rate than pipelines leak. Trains end up in the river. Tanker cars are easily punctured in the process. The petroleum product "will never" ignite in a derailment? Never? Not even with environmental loons looking to always sabotage the oil industry?
9702 2018-02-13 01:36:50 Btw don’t leave the anti dandruff blue stuff on for too long maybe like 30 mins or less depending on skin sensitivity I burnt my face doing that also get the scar oil too to help with the acne scars also ps ps not saying you have to try these remedies just wanted to be positive

9704 2018-02-13 01:36:44 The only reason Rs supported this bill is Oil and Gas told them they would give 4%.  We need to return to 7% and Ts aren't alone in needing a raise.  Plus, this bill gave with one hand and took away with the other.  We have to do better for everyone.
9705 2018-02-13 01:36:42 We just got some new *Dragon Oil*

9707 2018-02-13 01:36:22 This article hit me to the core. I remember the days of using coconut oil and baking soda on my face and having the worst breakouts ever. So glad I’ve learned better. 
9708 2018-02-13 01:36:09 Apologizing in advance to the nice Instagram follower who had to see me at Winners with a ton of coconut oil on my face 
9709 2018-02-13 01:36:04 In the Republic of Texas we only travel via horseback and then via camel across the desert that covers most of the Republic. It gets slippery at times with all of our oil bubbling to the surface. Don’t tell the Katie!

9715 2018-02-13 01:35:09 Fair. But tell me you at least found the oil change coupon and insurance punch card.
9716 2018-02-13 01:34:51 Yeah, tea tree oil works for keloids. Apply it a few times a day. And I’d keep a ring in if you can. It shouldn’t close, but I wouldn’t risk it
9717 2018-02-13 01:34:47 If you haven't, fry some breaded chicken bites in oil and toss them in General Tso Sauce!! It goes great with a side of steamed broccoli & asain-styled fried rice ;w;
9718 2018-02-13 01:34:35 Only #CadetBoneSpurs and his minions refute empirical data about #climatechange , Not because he's stupid,  although he is. His cronies in #Oil and #Gas are driving the energy bus that will eventually alter our environment immeasurably.

9721 2018-02-13 01:33:55 Bandaged wolf. Try to keep it covered so it doesn’t get any oil or other work related debri inside of it.
9722 2018-02-13 01:33:47 And I guarantee she smells like patchouli oil.
9723 2018-02-13 01:33:46 I bought that new eco styling gel with the castor oil in , wonder how it works .. anyone tried it ?

9728 2018-02-13 01:32:56 Meh, debatable. I agree it wouldn’t be good for us in the short term but the fact is, they do need our oil. Under Trump probably more than ever.

It would be tough for the US to replace 40% of their oil imports overnight.

9732 2018-02-13 01:32:44 .@SecretaryZinke just put oil & gas lobbyists ahead of American taxpayers by proposing to gut the BLM’s methane rule, undermining taxpayers, Western communities, and the air we breathe #cutmethane
9733 2018-02-13 01:32:41 @jessicaisummers Some friend the Saudi's are, they push for higher oil prices when we saved their butts during the Iraq war.
9734 2018-02-13 01:32:38 I realize gas/oil is needed and yes we all use. But there is proven other cleaner ways to get energy. Why not put money into that while still getting oil as before?
9735 2018-02-13 01:32:27 Enough oil already, build more refineries inAlta. Think Canada first Keep us supplied , too many tankers on coast already.

9747 2018-02-13 01:30:31 i spray ACV n tree tea oil (mixed) after i wipe my makeup off. Then washed my face really good. Then serum then i mixed a drop of tree tea and rose ship oil.    And peel twice a month
9748 2018-02-13 01:30:30 two words little Anthony: slant drilling. Get with the times, get real and stop posing. Calif is the largest consumer of oil.

9756 2018-02-13 01:29:52 Oh you mean she’ll learn how to squander 40 years worth of oil royalties?
9757 2018-02-13 01:29:48 Oh totally ;)
In retrospect, I don't actually remember why I was having them cut up that faerie whale...I want to say oil?

Piracy became big time./7
9764 2018-02-13 01:29:22 You deserve all the accolades and much better treatment but also couldn’t be faulted for looking elsewhere. The oil industry clearly has too much influence on state politics but Oklahomans also need to vote wiser in November.

9782 2018-02-13 01:27:26 Oil cos. already do that every week. Biggest scam no one talks about. Prices slide up, down $0.50/gal. No explanation. We're just used to it
9783 2018-02-13 01:27:24 Oil pulling w coconut oil has helped with sinus and colds. Make mouth feel clean. Kills garlic smell (I think)
9784 2018-02-13 01:27:17 Is that water color, Acryllic? Is can't be awesome oil!
9785 2018-02-13 01:26:50 Nak guna lebih dari 2 kali pun boleh tp nanti akan strip kulit of its natural oils. So lps tu kena letak hydrating products, mgkn facial oil sikit, utk restore balik kulit.
9786 2018-02-13 01:26:45 He notices an oil leak and sighs at the fact that no one had reported it yet, doing so himself before promptly going to a different one.
9787 2018-02-13 01:26:43 i got emotional over types of cooking oil today
9788 2018-02-13 01:26:38 ي قلبي انتي
9789 2018-02-13 01:26:28 Then rethinking oil, gas, gold etc will be necessary!
9790 2018-02-13 01:26:14 I don't think I'm grown up enough for the oil in ears. It freaks me out.
9791 2018-02-13 01:26:14 My mom bought bath bombs that have essential oils in them and it sound like a good idea til you’re slippin’ around like a decapitated chicken in an oil factory.
9792 2018-02-13 01:26:09 @KyTonightKET - I completely support marijuana reform! I have Complex PTSD & marijuana is the only thing that helps me! I've tried many Psychiatric drugs that did not help at all! The CBD oil helps a little. Without marijuana my suicidal thoughts would win.
9793 2018-02-13 01:26:04 That is just the Oil and Gas sectors.
9794 2018-02-13 01:26:01 Trump is a New York/Hollywood CARPET BAGGER, who instead of helping the poor, old, handicapped, and working class is a ROBBER BARON, closing agencies, stealing tax dollars for the 3% richest, budgeting trillions for bullshit, and removing regs for oil, banks, chemical co's, etc
9795 2018-02-13 01:26:00 they don't need our oil. that would be a mistake.
9796 2018-02-13 01:25:58 When the mic went dead during the Star Spangled Banner and the whole crowd finished singing it!! glad Brittany is ok too
9797 2018-02-13 01:25:56 Or thank them for not passing a train wreck of a package that would have seen teachers used as a pawn for oil/gas industry and there desire not to pay their fair share. We need 7% and no regressive taxes which punish the poor and working class.
9798 2018-02-13 01:25:54 Tax cuts meant tucked in the Senate tax bill's hundreds of pages is a proposal to open up 1.5 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling.

AMERICANS...$crumbs, temporary. 

You're one of them: Party over People.
9799 2018-02-13 01:25:48 Aku suka betul bila sebelum tidur aku letak coconut oil kat rambut. The next morning bila basuh rambut mesti rambut rasa lembut.
9800 2018-02-13 01:25:42 mine's already almost there. i gotta put the leave in conditioner/argon oil and let that dry. Then I can straighten. lol I would cry too if mine took that long!

9802 2018-02-13 01:25:05 Wild growth oil was a great suggestion tho. The shit is the holy grail for hair growth
9803 2018-02-13 01:25:05 Tea tree oil got this strong ass smell man
9804 2018-02-13 01:24:58 if it's fully healed, you can take it out and it shouldn't close up, tea tree oil helps for keloiding but if you're hesitant you should go to your piercer and ask them for help since they usually do it for free
9805 2018-02-13 01:24:54 I use the neutrogena oil free moisturizer for combo skin!! It’s made a huge difference on my skin since I’ve started using it

9807 2018-02-13 01:24:44 Put eucalyptus and lemon essential oil in my diffuser and it’s actually clearing my sinuses 
9808 2018-02-13 01:24:31 Yes but it was swimming in delicious garlic sauce which I'm confident is just garlic and oil
9809 2018-02-13 01:24:24 Has #danecook been drinking motor oil? 

That fucker looks...oh...about 68 years old.
9810 2018-02-13 01:24:23 Other than cost, how about durability? Sneakerser I believe is water based while sharpie is oil based. I know sneakerser are prone to cracks after some wears.
9811 2018-02-13 01:24:17 Trump Admin doesn't need to have relatives in Moscow, I believe Trump, Tillerson and Putin are just waiting (for right time) to lift Sanctions in the Arctic and ExxonMobil & Trump & Putin will make zillions in oil exploration. Also I believe Putin has Very Bad stuff over DT head!
9812 2018-02-13 01:24:16 Gonna soak in this tub. Oil down. AND GO TO DAMN SLEEP.
9813 2018-02-13 01:24:15 It’s hard turning a male into a female via brush and oil
9814 2018-02-13 01:24:13 Jail the Oil Pimps who laid a hand on this female activist
9815 2018-02-13 01:23:58 Is that what we went for I thought we went for a oil filter?
9816 2018-02-13 01:23:53 Deal, you’ll probably definitely win though bc I’m about to break down and get an oil change sometime this week (or next month/year).
9817 2018-02-13 01:23:52 Reusing spent espresso grounds by mixing with coconut oil, sugar, scents, makes for a pretty awesome hand/body scrub. Tested out some on my hands. And PS. It makes a nice valentines gift too
9818 2018-02-13 01:23:42 Seems like you identify with the beheaded. Unbunch your panties and try not to get too frightened by the oil paint
.
9819 2018-02-13 01:23:35 They tried looking for oil in the 1980's. This is a Nothing Burger by Raimondo and the Four Flat Tires (stole that line from @bobbytherep). 

RI needs a molten salt nuclear power plant or more pipelines for natural gas.

9832 2018-02-13 01:22:40 BTW, vultures are using this thread to prey on us. "Michelle" @CureChronic is a shill for a bullshit "pesticide cleanse" that claims chronic pain is caused by exposure to plastic/pesticides/etc
We're all smart enough not to fall for this snake oil, right?
9833 2018-02-13 01:22:30 This is a joke. Oil industry is the most tested industry in the country and the heaviest drug users as well. People have ways around stupid laws.

9839 2018-02-13 01:21:46 Yes. I’m familiar. Again. Not “lectures”. Just nonsense that sounds scientific to the untrained eye ultimately aimed at selling snake oil.

9844 2018-02-13 01:21:19 Shame on the fascist oil whores who allowed this to happen.
Perhaps oil will remain in our country’s energy portfolio and on a significant scale.
But to kill its parasitic powers and supremacy is a consummation devoutly to be wished.
9845 2018-02-13 01:21:13 I see your point about 1. Don't agree with 2 or 3 but I can vouch that garlic oil is better than butter.  No go away, you've ruined my day and it's only 1:30am

9975 2018-02-13 01:06:36 @marklevinshow Syria for finally stands up for themselves. Russians helped kill ISIS. Iran and Syrian are doing business. Syria has reported to U. N. Security Council about Isreal coming into their Country. Turks arn't giving Oil fields to kurds. Kurds are from Turkey. No War

9979 2018-02-13 01:06:22 This state couldn't do better even if it tried with both hands tied behind its back... why?  Because of the oil overlords in OKC.
9980 2018-02-13 01:06:20 Time to stop electing people whose pockets are lined by special interests & big oil. Guess who they care about? It’s not those in their district. Speak with your VOTE and elect people who will come up with good, sustainable solutions. #okleg
9981 2018-02-13 01:05:58 He’s always been a snake oil salesman.  Being surprised by that says more about you Joe.
9982 2018-02-13 01:05:47 Happy to state whatever was trying to make me ill DID NOT SUCCEED! Oil of Oregano, along with air purifiers with UV bulbs, have succeeded in keeping me healthy!

9986 2018-02-13 01:05:30 Such an inferior, inflammatory oil 
9987 2018-02-13 01:05:20 I painted my Boost on my Nmd beaters with my sharpie oil based and it did wonders. I got 4 for $12 in staples LOL
9988 2018-02-13 01:05:12 Throw in Canada and Brazil, and pundits/analysts are still bullish oil? I guess OPEC will just keep losing market share.
9989 2018-02-13 01:05:11 apparently it's harsh/bad but I feel like thats a pretty reasonable conclusion to come to, like hey soap..it is for washing away oil... its good to know the right tools to use if youre@trying to solve a problem but the kind of visceral horror is like...mmmelodramatic
9990 2018-02-13 01:05:10 So i called the dealership to schedule my oil change Wednesday and before the girl hung up she said “ok mr. Santos, I’ll see you on Valentine’s Day” so idk bout y’all but that sounds like a date to me.
9991 2018-02-13 01:05:02 yesterday morning i drank a @JuiceLandTx shot with CBD oil in it so that i could be ~chill~ while i deep cleaned my house and instead i slept literally all day long 
9992 2018-02-13 01:04:56 Can’t find this comment anywhere. Help.  If true, major impact on the backwarded curve in that it will go higher and may positively impact oil share prices. Raymond James seems to attribute the decoupling of commodity prices and equities to a steeper curve.
9993 2018-02-13 01:04:44 I can see how they rationalized it. Public testimony is supposed to be about the bill, not the sponsors. But the oil and gas interests involved here absolutely make it relevant to the bill. It was unjust what they did.
9994 2018-02-13 01:04:28 Lol my hair hates olive oil too. 
Fuck.
9995 2018-02-13 01:04:19 Here’s a story. The US is producing record numbers on oil production. Closing in on 1970 numbers in fact, yet you’re still pushing pipelines and grabbing land?
9996 2018-02-13 01:04:19 Since we're talking about ratios, let's talk about Vescio's oil to pasta ratio! Probably 3:1
9997 2018-02-13 01:04:18 You might want to look into JFKs policies.  Specifically his anti oil, pro-union, ones.
9998 2018-02-13 01:04:06 you are going to cook the salmon in so much oil its going to be swimming again just like the steaks
9999 2018-02-13 01:03:59 Now that #curling is over, the #okleg will reconvene and try to perform mental gymnastics to see how they can get the necessary yes votes, they need to officially becomes the gas and oil companies .... and screw the teachers of Oklahoma in the process.
10000 2018-02-13 01:03:50 3/3 I my day,  the people selling snake oil didn't take it themselves. Ask yourself where your arrogance comes from to think you know better than the professionals who have spent years studying and practising.
10001 2018-02-13 01:03:46 America is built on the dreams of our Founding Fathers.  Godly men of genius & vision.  It's up to Americans to keep it alive & make it thrive.
10002 2018-02-13 01:03:44 To recap this day, I’m covered in Mud, Coffee, Peanut Butter and now Olive Oil. Supper can finish making itself. I’m pouring a never-happened-before Monday Scotch. Olympics & sudoku for the rest of the night.
10003 2018-02-13 01:03:29 Baby oil on them booty cheeks when you giving her back shots is a necessity.
10004 2018-02-13 01:03:23 Im going to ask you a question because im curious do you think we should stop using oil because we don't have much left and we will soon run out and develop new ways of using with it or should we keep using oil and use it up untill we run out.
10005 2018-02-13 01:03:13 Decided that today was a good day to get my oil changed. I was wrong, I am too hungry for this
10006 2018-02-13 01:03:12 I have not done well in the OIl and Gas trades.  Paying my dues.

10013 2018-02-13 01:01:43 Pretty well known !  Hmm I wonder who pays them to allow oil drilling
10014 2018-02-13 01:01:38 Brazil should invade and annex Venezuela. It would help save their suffering people and actually make use of their amazing oil reserves that that pathetic Socialist Maduro and Chavez failed to capitalize on

America wouldn't hesitate at all if Venezuela was its bordering neighbor
