1 2018-11-25 23:59:50 Lmao oil had been falling for many of the Wynne years and gas prices kept soaring. If you think it’s an economic issue, go check the prices in BC and see if they have fallen.
2 2018-11-25 23:59:46 face oil is also nice in your foundation to make it apply smoothier
3 2018-11-25 23:59:44 Oh nooo! But also ooh yes. I have Ian now regularly moisturizing and also using beard oil.
Glad it went well other than the beard attack

5 2018-11-25 23:59:35 You said that you have bad allergies try mint oil it's super power full you just oil you pure  little in your nose it hurts but after a while you will suddenly breath believe me I tried it when I couldn't breath so I hope you see it
6 2018-11-25 23:59:26 And all the scientists that disagree are connected to oil companies. There is is still a lot of money to be made from oil, it is in there financial interest to pretend it doesn’t exist. What is the goal of these corrupted climatologists?
7 2018-11-25 23:59:21 It's actually not cheaper, for a couple reasons. First, oil benefits from older infrastructure that needs to be replaced anyway. Second, the industry doesn't pay the costs of carbon, which the rest of us do (health issues, pollution, etc). More on hydrogen in a sec.

9 2018-11-25 23:59:10 Thank you oil glut and fear of recession, I pity the fool.
And didn't you already give credit to your dismemberment pals the Saudis for the drop in oil prices? #MAGA
10 2018-11-25 23:58:53 There hasn't been a president since the Oil Crisis that would tell the House of Saud to go to hell. None of them want to face the repercussions of expensive oil or what happens to the USD if Saudis stop taking it for oil.
11 2018-11-25 23:58:52 Hi Dawn!  Sorry, just seen this. I have beard oil samples or were you talking about something else?
12 2018-11-25 23:58:47 Spray vegetable oil all over them. They won’t get any traction.

Yeah of course! And wh-

16 2018-11-25 23:58:38 "They" didn't.  We just opened the largest refinery in Canada...started under Harper.  JT cancelled three pipelines and allowed even more foreign oil imports out east.  Welcome to the consequences part of the election.  More virtue signalling needed!!

38 2018-11-25 23:58:20 Generally speaking when they say harmful to the economy they mean harmful to their friends in oil and gas. Jobs aren't lost/they're transformed. Do you think there'd be more jobs if we kept buggies and blacksmiths?
39 2018-11-25 23:58:16 When the US finds oil in another country
40 2018-11-25 23:58:08 Did you trade an oil deal for a life? If one of yours met the same fate as Khasoggj,  would your response have been the same?   I hope karma lets us find out.
41 2018-11-25 23:58:06 #ABEXIT and pipeline will get built. If Cda not interested it will go south only. Cda can buy Saudi oil.
42 2018-11-25 23:58:00 Coconut oil be blessing my skin
43 2018-11-25 23:57:58 If I lock Lucas Oil no one leaves until I'm ready
44 2018-11-25 23:57:57 Get or make some Rick Simpson Oil and feed it to Scout. Just Google Rick Simpson Oil. He cured his own cancer with it. There is a video documentary on him on YouTube. Please look into this. I did not discover this treatment until after my father died of cancer. @Robinet_Joe
45 2018-11-25 23:57:56 Palm oil, rapeseed oil aka Frankenstein fats...
46 2018-11-25 23:57:45 Option #1, we get nothing. Option #2, we ask for oil. Hmmmmmm, tough choice there.
47 2018-11-25 23:57:45 Obama  deported more people than any president in history.And lying at the border about your situation and saying that you're being persecuted when you're not,is not legal,having a constant flow of poor people is notgood for our country. You still driving that car with Saudi oil?
48 2018-11-25 23:57:44 Delusional as always!!!  How long do you think oil prices will fall Donny?  Oh and by the way the Saudi's don't have anything to do with the price!!
49 2018-11-25 23:57:43 They go past my house, bnsf is right on the ocean 15 to 20 odd times day and night carrying oil.  Long snakes of oil, right on our ocean front.
50 2018-11-25 23:57:42 Except your dear fuhrer is sticking his nose and interested in the oil and putting a direct human cost on it. So your statement doesn’t really hold up.

53 2018-11-25 23:57:24 Trump stripped Grand Staircase by 50% and Bears Ears by 85% for oil and mining. Fuck capitalism.
54 2018-11-25 23:57:21 Even some German Greens thought palm oil was good. Which is why I left them.
55 2018-11-25 23:57:20 Awesome. Highly recommend using it. Also... swishing coconut oil in your mouth for 10-20 minutes will kill bacteria - DO NOT SWALLOW - spit it in the trash (not the sink).

60 2018-11-25 23:56:43 Putin will be gone in less than 1000 days.  That oil prices are below 60 a barrel and this occurs with Ukraine is not coincidental
61 2018-11-25 23:56:41 American firms have controlled the oil industry in Canada for decades. They own most of the facilities, leases, production...
62 2018-11-25 23:56:37 Yeah, thanks for making great friends with murderers so you can take credit for falling oil prices. Your sick dude.
63 2018-11-25 23:56:36 What is even more amazing is that he is trying to sell he is bringing oil prices down. 
He drove them up so the Saudis could pay for weapons
$33 when he was elected
$70+ after he meet with the Saudis and made the deal
64 2018-11-25 23:56:32 Your tweet is delusional m Majority of our oil (40%)requirements comes from Canada only 10% might come from Saudi Arabia, don't think anything Saudi Arabia does will effect USA that much. Please do your homework
65 2018-11-25 23:56:24 Stop lying Fred Flintstone you had nothing to do with the oil price change
66 2018-11-25 23:56:20 Remember way back when high oil prices were detrimental to the economy?
67 2018-11-25 23:56:16 Folks like Tom Steyer and bankers like JPMorgan benefit from investments that are virtually guaranteed by subsidies. Even the Russians and Iranians would like to see us “go solar” so we will burn their oil after dark. Nuclear power would end them as world players.
68 2018-11-25 23:55:56 We get our oil from Canada, stop lying
69 2018-11-25 23:55:40 Mentioned to a friend in the oil & gas industry tonight about Cameron's attempts to keep Clair Ridge secret in run up to #indyref in 2014. His response "Brits did a good job in covering up but anyone with an iota of knowledge of Scotland's oil & gas industry knew how big it was".
70 2018-11-25 23:55:38 But the oil and gas mafia is pushing back through their government men to delay issuance of permits and licenses all over South East Asia!
71 2018-11-25 23:55:35 Or that liberals, who need a strong oil market, will be anti-oil.
72 2018-11-25 23:55:32 Lucas Oil was so electric that play. I wish we did that more
73 2018-11-25 23:55:30 LOL this is the first time this happened to me and I’m just like uh what cause I don’t ever use perfume and this is legit my first time hearing about face oil
74 2018-11-25 23:55:19 As opposed to the penniless truth seekers in the oil and gas industry.
75 2018-11-25 23:55:12 Favors from the US. VZ is oil rich, and Brazil is already a US client state under Temer.  Bolsorano is also planning on massacring indigenous tribes for their land so he can raze the rest of the Amazon. Nothing is beyond the pale now
76 2018-11-25 23:55:10 Ladies if you don’t get an oil change at least make sure you have water, oil, brake fuild, antifreeze and power steering.
77 2018-11-25 23:55:09 This picture is so true. Why are we even over there? Oil? We have more underneath our country then we can use. We kill thousands of children every year with bombs in the name of protection.
78 2018-11-25 23:55:07 Kata mamah coba beli kutus kutus oil. Aku udah lumayan sembuh soalnya
79 2018-11-25 23:55:05 The problem is most of us never see the low oil prices. Our fuel prices remain relatively stagnant due to state legialators quietly increasing fuel taxes incremently year after year during the winter price lulls.
80 2018-11-25 23:55:02 僕まだ今年ようやく新幹線デビューしたばかりなのでw
81 2018-11-25 23:54:59 But that is the company drilling the oil, not the money from the oil sales. Don't trust Exxon, don't have faith in them. But you can't deny the potential income could revolutionise things. Life in Guyana could be very different.
82 2018-11-25 23:54:50 Is coconut oil actually bad for your skin? And if so than how damaging can it be??
83 2018-11-25 23:54:49 Has oil pulling actually helped anyone ?
84 2018-11-25 23:54:39 Probably should’ve spent the previous years encouraging Alberta to invest the oil profits in a sustainable way. I’m sure you did though. Otherwise, you look kind of complicit with regards to the problems they’re now facing.
85 2018-11-25 23:54:34 #RussiaAttacksUkraine:
SWIFT - to cut off.
Gas and oil supply from Russia - to stop.
All assets - to froze.
UNSC - to exclude from
86 2018-11-25 23:54:25 Am I missing something?? 
Seems like the GOP (a.k.a. 'Trump's Minions') count several U.S. oil barons amongst their numbers.

Between this ridiculous overture and his ass kissing the Saudis, isn't he afraid he'll lose their support?
87 2018-11-25 23:54:21 Kite geng la pyqa hahaha. Tp Chinese kata fish oil ok. So kite boleh try nanti
88 2018-11-25 23:54:09 U get 11% of your oil from the Saudis.

90 2018-11-25 23:54:01 I gotta make sure i get my oil changed this week
91 2018-11-25 23:53:53 If you don't support the oil and gas industry in Canada you should have to travel solely by bicycle or pay a surcharge to ride public transit. . Enjoy riding your bikes and roller blades all winter.
92 2018-11-25 23:53:52 Two reasons we're so involved in the middle East is because of the oil and Israel. We have all the oil we need right here in the Gulf of Mexico and ANWAR. Israel should always be able to count on the US if needed. Leave the sob's alone.
93 2018-11-25 23:53:51 all this time I’ve been salivating over motor oil pancakes
94 2018-11-25 23:53:47 I don't think it's blackmail. Given what we already know about Dump, who'd be shocked by anything that gets disclosed? I think it's business. Big, big, big business, like you get with the world's top oil producers. $$$$$
95 2018-11-25 23:53:45 Synthetic has a much much much larger potential market than dilbit. But it's too late to do that now. The global glut is going to continue as the end of oil nears. The US keeps increasing production and inflating the glut. We'd be smart to divest from oil than to play that game.
96 2018-11-25 23:53:41 The world is full of assholes my dear!
97 2018-11-25 23:53:30 Because it’s still cheaper to use oil. But that is changing - slowly. The Third World will still gravitate towards the least expensive energy source. I’m still not sure why hydrogen hasn’t caught on. You can power existing engines with it. BMW did 20+ years ago!
98 2018-11-25 23:53:27 I’ve definitely done that. The original was a guy I saw when I was a kid. He just face planted straight into a glass divider between doors. He about knocked himself out. I remember the face print on the glass it made from the oil on his skin
99 2018-11-25 23:52:36 Sad... have you tried clove oil? Or putting a clove bud in your mouth for an extended period of time?
100 2018-11-25 23:52:35 For oil prices
101 2018-11-25 23:52:16 Are you long oil?
102 2018-11-25 23:52:11 so many gorgeous squidlets! Honestly feeling a little uneasy re: oil platforms in the middle of that habitat.

106 2018-11-25 23:51:55 Definitely burnt myself a few times cooking with that oil 
107 2018-11-25 23:51:47 You do know we get the majority our oil from Canada 
108 2018-11-25 23:51:36 It seems like scientists who are paid by the Koch brothers or the oil and gas industry to deny the reality of manmade climate change probably get paid far more than climate scientists who work for nonprofits, universities, or the government.
109 2018-11-25 23:51:33 It is time for Canadians to stand up and fight for your way of life if you don’t support Alberta oil but support Quebec and BC dumping sewage into the ocean you have your priorities in the wrong order if GM won’t build cars or trucks in Canada buy from a maker that will support
110 2018-11-25 23:51:30 Perhaps, all too many do not realize the importance of the Saudis to the US, though you should. Do we rush to judgment based on the actions of a few, regardless of who ordered the killing? Do we disrupt the world's dependence on Saudi oil without solid/hard evidence? I think NOT
111 2018-11-25 23:51:25 Wrong on so many levels. We get most of our oil from Canada. I would rather pay more for gas than accept we are a country that allows barbaric murder of a journalist. They don't hold the leverage regardless of what lying, cheating traitorous Trump says.
112 2018-11-25 23:51:24 Lol. For dry skin, on a v basic level - the Belif Moisture Bomb is really great! For oils, I’ve heard a lot of good stuff about Sunday Riley’s Juno oil & the Fresh Seaberry Oil. I’m still being a cheap ass tho and use the Pixi Rose Oil.
113 2018-11-25 23:51:23 The Republican party is indistinguishable from the oil lobby
114 2018-11-25 23:51:23 Left work to catch up on errands; Target run & oil change. And I’m STILL taking my lunch break when I get back god bless
115 2018-11-25 23:51:22 It's just money and oil. What it has always been for decades.
116 2018-11-25 23:51:22 Low gas prices? Are you kidding me. Last time gasoline prices were this high oil was $140 a barrel WTI and $150 Brent crude. Can someone remind me again how much WTI was at the close on Friday?
117 2018-11-25 23:51:20 《オリーブ油豆知識》
オリーブ油は オレイン酸が腸の刺激を促してくれるため、便秘解消効果がある
118 2018-11-25 23:51:11 You know the price of WTI (that stands for West Texas Intermediate crude, btw) is still higher now than at the end of Obama’s presidency, don’t you? Maybe ask RickPerry and Steve Mnuchin to explain it to you. Great for oil investors, not so great for your base. @WhiteHouse @POTUS
119 2018-11-25 23:51:04 LOL same and i apparently been needing an oil change and i barely found out 
120 2018-11-25 23:50:45 40曲越えてるのすごすぎるの
121 2018-11-25 23:50:44 Ignoring a murder of a United States citizen in return for lower oil prices. No thanks. I'd rather pay $5.00 a gallon than compromise morals and values.
122 2018-11-25 23:50:38 Oil down, NG down = recession/depression coming  ? ask for a friend...
123 2018-11-25 23:50:37 rt to this, spend the money on a good battery and then only buy cartridges from people who are vetted by others u know,,, cus some people sell literally empty oil that is unhealthy to ingest and doesn’t get u high
124 2018-11-25 23:50:37 i believe that each and every executive at every oil and gas company that undoubtingly understood that their actions were contributing to global climate change should be charged with crimes against humanity.

but you know they won't before they die knowing they got away with it.
125 2018-11-25 23:50:35 Sorry Todd. The problem is obvious. The energy sector is being strangled because of opposition to Canadian Oil , pure and simple. By a group of well placed and well organized people who have their own reasons to destroy the energy sector in Canada. You can figure it out.
126 2018-11-25 23:50:28 Current, Electric vehicles need lithium for the batteries. Most of it comes from Bolivia. I never said that they don’t have an ecological footprint. However, it is a much smaller footprint than oil & gas development.
127 2018-11-25 23:50:24 Respect to people who use oil paint cause i can’t even touch that shit
128 2018-11-25 23:50:23 Your comments related to the lack of 'mainstream (FT / WSJ)' coverage of the Aramco oil deal with China would be appreciated.
129 2018-11-25 23:50:17 Stamina from “charged electrons”? I don’t think so. So Trump is drawn to snake oil products. Interesting. I wonder if he uses Alex Jones’ brain pills.
130 2018-11-25 23:50:16 American stereotypes have evolved over the time. Americans eat cheeseburgers. Americans are hungry for oil. Americans clap all the time for no reason. The new craze is that Americans love to hurt children. Between Sandy Hook, detention centers, and today...yikes
131 2018-11-25 23:50:10 I know. The oil is what is keeping them afloat. As for Northern England. There was a survey put out that many of people in the north would rather leave with Scotland than stay with a London centric government.
132 2018-11-25 23:50:03 You think that by Alberta separating that you will stop paying taxes?  You're just going to pay a whole helluva lot more.. And you still won't get your oil to tidewater (through BC) because no one needs it anymore.  I suggest you diversify.
133 2018-11-25 23:49:58 Thanked himself for the oil prices or this?
134 2018-11-25 23:49:54 BRAVO!! Alberta needs good govt and the NDP have provided that regardless of all the chaos that surrounds the oil industry!! Good for you for your courage in supporting them!
135 2018-11-25 23:49:52 I started by cleaning my place up like a good kid and spent the afternoon making spicy oil with my parents.  Let’s hope we don’t flop on this oil thing.
136 2018-11-25 23:49:44 I’m good y’all. Y’all know I love my car and I take care of it, keep up with my oil changes...etc. at the end of the day, it’s still a mustang lol
137 2018-11-25 23:49:42 Back in the olden days, it was usually over black oil. Nowadays, in Trumpworld, it's brown skin.
138 2018-11-25 23:49:28 全自動人間洗濯機で洗われてみたい
139 2018-11-25 23:49:27 Right. And nothing to do with world oil prices, I suppose.
140 2018-11-25 23:49:25 Comrade Francis probably wouldn't be a good crude oil futures trader. I doubt Comrade Cortez would either.
141 2018-11-25 23:49:16 Using an oil cleanser at night is helping a lot. not 100% sold on the trader joe's version but when I'm done will get a different type for sure.
142 2018-11-25 23:49:15 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
143 2018-11-25 23:49:15 Also- we don't need their oil. He has a glaring ignorance, of basic global economics.
144 2018-11-25 23:49:01 You're really going through the mill with Lymes - my heart goes out to you.I swear by Amla oil for my hair. It's from the Indian gooseberry and keeps my hair in great nick. Any time Im cooking lentils, I use the water they've been soaking in as a rinse- my granny always did this.
145 2018-11-25 23:48:53 If you're ranking NFL stadiums, just how low is Lucas Oil? It's far from a top 10 and probably even 20
146 2018-11-25 23:48:33 Why you allow the buying of oil from Saudi’s then?
147 2018-11-25 23:48:31 @Hersheys How can you use palm oil in your products when palm oil crops are killing orangutans?
148 2018-11-25 23:48:27 Also thanks to president Trump for forcing lower oil prices, today in the order of $50/barrel!!
149 2018-11-25 23:48:24 เสื้อตัวไหนคะ
150 2018-11-25 23:48:14 What improvement ? Oil prices don’t fall because of what a president does or says !! Trump has nothing to do with oil prices !  The economy was good before he came, the deficit was lower too.  Why doesn’t he talk about the deficit? Which is increasing by the minute!
151 2018-11-25 23:48:03 The entire GOP depends on big oil to finance them.
152 2018-11-25 23:48:01 今日から5連勤という重労働
153 2018-11-25 23:47:49 Usually when an army enters another country, they stay, take the oil, no asking.
154 2018-11-25 23:47:47 Well I’ve got an idea about what we shouldn’t do..  and that is interfere in other people’s governments for oil and other resources and then leave them in shambles that helps create the issues we are seeing now...
155 2018-11-25 23:47:39 Just like our oil packing up going south. Auto industry, steel workers next to go! Trudeau government has helped Trump MAGA we will be the dumping ground for UN!
156 2018-11-25 23:47:37 "I am alive at night. I am dead in the morning, an old vessel who used up her oil, bleak and pale boned." - Anne Sexton
157 2018-11-25 23:47:36 @steelers did all y’all wash y’all hand with baby oil today!!!! No? Maybe Butter???  LETS HOLD ON TO THE BALL.
158 2018-11-25 23:47:35 Please keep your passion up as you are opposed by the ignorant, those paid off by the oil industry, those lining their own pockets and those who are just evil.  We are counting on you and we thank you.
159 2018-11-25 23:47:31 Rick Santorum needs to jump in an oil lake. The man is an idiot. Why is CNN still giving him air time?
160 2018-11-25 23:47:30 Of our total oil imports, 9% comes from the Saudi’s..Unbelievable how ignorant Tumplandia is
161 2018-11-25 23:47:19 Yup. It’s oil lol.
162 2018-11-25 23:47:15 They want that North Sea Oil money Jamie! If that dried up, they'd not be bothered. The UK government doesn't even care about the north of england, much less the other countries within the union!
163 2018-11-25 23:47:10 ??
164 2018-11-25 23:47:09 Oh if oil and inflation were yours to take credit.  I'm happy for those who have felt the benefits of your tax break; when will you announce the tax break for the middle class so I can feel the goodness of your omnipotence?
165 2018-11-25 23:47:00 I think you’ll find it’s the reverse, Rick, politicIans are in the pocket of coal, gas and oil
166 2018-11-25 23:46:51 The order u apply moisturizers is v important too! My favorite in the winter is a “moisturizer sandwich” lol. Facial spray > 3 drops of face oil > facial spray again > moisturizer > final spray of facial spray. I can give recs too but the order is important!
167 2018-11-25 23:46:51 Er the US EXPORTS oil TO France, the French then add $4.5 a gallon tax to stop the global warming on MARS, Hillary & the DNC lobbied for that tax HERE cause stopping Global warming on mars lined their corrupt pockets, Now Occasio Cortez & Sanders are throwing them out , JOBS 1st
168 2018-11-25 23:46:51 Scientists say human activity is the course of climate change/ global warming.  A BIG NO! Money is. because those activities are driven by money making. God only said till the soil. No industries no oil drilling .
169 2018-11-25 23:46:48 Loving almond oil right now
170 2018-11-25 23:46:37 Did you say that when oil prices were going up??
171 2018-11-25 23:46:33 -body butter

173 2018-11-25 23:45:47 Brakes rotors calibers are really bad. Can’t even back up sometimes (well I can’t back up anymore) and oh yeah I need a oil change. And I’m pretty sure my car is going to blow up soon. So I need to start looking for a new car.
174 2018-11-25 23:45:32 disrupt mustard oil
175 2018-11-25 23:45:32 I can’t even tell you, I just asked for a regular oil change lol
176 2018-11-25 23:45:31 #drones last week completed a drone oil inspection of a clients roof.  I shared the video with the customer and they absolutely loved it.
177 2018-11-25 23:45:31 We only get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. We get 40% from CANADA! Trump has absolutely nothing to do with it. Lying again! Sad.
178 2018-11-25 23:45:29 Happy to share. This beat salad is w olive oil. Fresh beats, carrots, potatoes. Boil till soft. Peel. Chop into cubes. Add 1 can sweat peas, 1 chopped onion. 2 (or more) garlic cloves squished. Good pickles r key. chop those. salt, pepper to taste. done. can send pickle pic
179 2018-11-25 23:45:19 the army back the $ now. try selling oil in a different currency?
180 2018-11-25 23:45:10 Mm nah. Just choose either one (oil cleansing or micellar water) then you go with the next step which is pencuci muka biasa
181 2018-11-25 23:44:58 Antes de 1939 Pedro Aguirre Cerda fue abogado de intereses salitreros y también de Standard Oil. En ambos casos, su rol fue chantajear al Estado en épocas críticas. Su "know how" lo llevó junto a socios, a fundar COPEC, y la favoreció con créditos blandos cuando fue Presidente.
182 2018-11-25 23:44:52 That's a problem with straightforward solutions. Most electric cars aren't $100K. You can get them now for as little as $30K. They'll get even cheaper and better as economies of scale kick in. And solar and wind are already cheaper in most areas of the country than coal and oil.
183 2018-11-25 23:44:37 @lufthansa jumped 2.7% and @AirFrance leapt 2.7% as oil prices crumbled, while Ericsson surged 3.9% and @nokia jumped 1.5% on media reports the White House had asked allies not to buy telecoms equipment made by Chinese rival Huawei.
184 2018-11-25 23:44:28 BCAAs, fish oil pills, and a superfood/greens powder.
185 2018-11-25 23:44:23 Just sobering up and realized this crazy girl literally ate a 2 gram chunk of oil. 

Like who the fuck does that?
186 2018-11-25 23:44:22 I just want someone to oil my hair for me
187 2018-11-25 23:43:43 今週も頑張ります。仕事も趣味も。
188 2018-11-25 23:43:39 You are not serious - right?
189 2018-11-25 23:43:31 Just thought "you are my rock" about lavender essential oil
190 2018-11-25 23:43:28 So let me understand this.....the Saudi’s kill a journalist working for a US News organization and we get lower oil prices?  I doubt that the journalist’s family thinks  that’s a good deal. Certainly not on to thank YOU for.
191 2018-11-25 23:43:25 I'd like Comrade Francis to tell everyone what the implied volatility of the at the money straddle will be in crude oil futures (front month contract) next Friday?
192 2018-11-25 23:43:23 He has money, power and fear. He doesn’t need to play chess, he just does what he wants because no one wants to lose their oil supply. What’s the world going to do? Impose sanctions? Then what? He puts a premium on their oil? It’s not chess, it’s possible to win a game of chess.
193 2018-11-25 23:42:59 Thank you! They were so yummy and easy, I just chucked them in a baking dish with olive oil, honey and salt and basically forgot about them until the chicken was done.
194 2018-11-25 23:42:58 @sapinker  the solution (since its a proscriptive environment) is for congress to task the NRC with speedily creating a regulatory environment for GenIV+ nuclear that encourages a transition from coal/oil (eventually gas) to nuclear. Of course you also need a feed of engineers
195 2018-11-25 23:42:46 Ko baby oil sih minyak telon!!
196 2018-11-25 23:42:40 This is not a majority of scientists, it is a majority of geologist and engineers who belong to a Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta. People working in the oil industry in the first place. They also came forward and said Taylor's claims are false.
197 2018-11-25 23:42:30 TRUMP. FOR $50 DOLLAR A BARREL OIL THE SAUDIS CAN KILL KHASHOGGI AND AS MANY OTHER ARABS THEY WANT. WHO CARES, ESPECIALLY FOR A LEFTIST NEWSPAPER NEWSMAN.
198 2018-11-25 23:42:29 Baby oil is life!!!
199 2018-11-25 23:42:28 Have you seen that Mars show? There were these Artic Conservation Society Soy Club nutjobs who took a boat to a Norwegian drilling station & start rappelling onto the deck from their boat. The oil workers started blasting them with ice cold hose water. They were arrested & jailed
200 2018-11-25 23:42:20 You can't relocate Whisky, Fishing, oil, wind farms and alternate energy firms or even where the water falls. Do you mean we would probably see more businesses relocate to Scotland with access to the EU with no tariffs or transaction costs to worry about.
201 2018-11-25 23:42:18 tea tree oil is like a necessity for me when it comes to my hair. literally though! i need tea tree oil more than i need a comb damn near
202 2018-11-25 23:42:14 When was the last time you visited Fort Mc or anywhere around the oil sands? Saying “complete disregard” is quite a statement. You must have first hand knowledge that is much different then mine.
203 2018-11-25 23:42:13 Trump and Putin have a deal with Bin Salmon. Money ,oil , pole drilling. They need to be stopped.
204 2018-11-25 23:42:10 Valencian Paella: rice, chicken, rabbit, olive oil, water, snails, beans, tomato, garlic and salt ;)
205 2018-11-25 23:42:09 Good thing oil prices are down and he had nothing to do with it.. but, fuck the facts eh?
206 2018-11-25 23:42:07 Next level salesmanship at my local running store! They shot a video of me jogging on a treadmill to match me with the perfect sneaker. Still don't know why I had to oil up my legs and wear that nightie, but I love my new Pumas!
207 2018-11-25 23:42:04 I say to you; pack up and start moving to higher ground. Nature is in a recycling cycle. But of course you would not know that. The earths climate has been relatively stable for the past 15,000 years.

I wouldn't worry about the cost associated with humans short minded decisions.
208 2018-11-25 23:42:02 We r part of a farmer's cooperative selling soybeans 4 tofu 2 Asian food processors in DC/Baltimore/Philly/NYC region. Small mom&pop places. Co-Op also handles exports like Natto beans 2Japan. Perdue has highOleic oil plant. The meal is fed 2chickens & oil refined 4food companies
209 2018-11-25 23:42:00 The oil industry "destroyed" the oil industry with a global supply glut. The AB industry is currently producing too much for pipeline capacity. The Liberals purchased a project when an American company didn't want to proceed. A court stopped it. The Liberals are working on it.

Top investments of all time.
211 2018-11-25 23:41:46 Read the recent oil import numbers before making such an inaccurate post. The rest of us did.
212 2018-11-25 23:41:44 Humans have their failings, but I find it more likely Politicians are bought off by Big Energy (oil & coal) than scientists (by Solar companies).
213 2018-11-25 23:41:43 Spiz oil
214 2018-11-25 23:41:39 my mom said her dream is to wash off a duck with oil on it....shooting for the stars aren’t ya jami
215 2018-11-25 23:41:31 OMG PRESIDENT T THAT STANDS FOR TINY TEENY TOT OR PRESIDENT TURNIP YOU HAVE NO NADA TO DO WITH OIL PRICES
216 2018-11-25 23:41:27 so they had to import everything, which was fine until the Oil crisis.
217 2018-11-25 23:41:18 Get over it, people who love the snake oil salesman should come first.
218 2018-11-25 23:41:11 They transported the gold in an oil tanker, the weight forced them to do so! Today Lybia stands listed as a failed state!
219 2018-11-25 23:41:05 You would slide out in the oil !
220 2018-11-25 23:41:04 Oh and to complete, since selling Oil made so much money, the value of their coin was about the same of the american dollar, which makes it impossible to industrializate a country because you don't make enough profits to keep up with the competition +
221 2018-11-25 23:40:53 It'll be interesting to know the current fuel prices had the pricing formula was in effect given global crude oil rates are at a lowest in a year! #lka #srilanka @MangalaLK @EranWick @HarshadeSilvaMP
222 2018-11-25 23:40:51 Gotcha, I’ve never actually heard of face oil before LOL
223 2018-11-25 23:40:45 It’s the opposite of small-minded - being willing to consider alternatives when your main option is not great is important. Dependence on oil is bad for the economy and our future, and if investing in alternatives “kills” it, then it doesn’t deserve to be propped up.
224 2018-11-25 23:40:38 Trudeau doesn't give a damn about our economy. Proof is what he's done to Alberta's OIL industry ... Canada's largest export on life support!
225 2018-11-25 23:40:33 I think I saw the slits with the stranglers, Peter Gabriel and spun oil at Battersea Park. (It might have been a dream.)
226 2018-11-25 23:40:33 I don't doubt that oil will bring challenges. Of course it will. But the windfall of money and employment (both directly and indirectly) has the potential to be hugely beneficial. Critique it, of course, everyone should.
227 2018-11-25 23:40:32 As you Drive around in your car, fly to your holiday destinations, use synthetics in your clothing and jackets and shoes, use all sorts of plastics in everyday items, heat your home with natural gas Yep it’s all oil company’s fault
228 2018-11-25 23:40:31 You are a special kind of stupid aren’t you? You have nothing to do with oil prices dropping. And inflation is up! That’s thanks to your policies the tax cut is killing the economy. Your tariffs are causing layoffs from ford. Harley moved to England. And gas hasn’t dropped yet!
229 2018-11-25 23:40:28 Would the climate change scientist please move his red Ferrari, it’s blocking the oil tycoon’s Ford Fiesta.
230 2018-11-25 23:40:27 Santorum certainly has cojones of steel.  How much money did he take from Big Oil & other polluters when he was in office?  For a family values conservative, he doesn't seem to care that he's leaving his (too) many children a newly hellish environment in which to survive.  Sick!
231 2018-11-25 23:40:17 It's all about incentives to them.  If we change our currency system from one of Debt and Oil to one tied to the health and prosperity of the environment, voila!  Done deal.
232 2018-11-25 23:40:13 Oil check? @markschlereth
233 2018-11-25 23:40:11 My lactation specialist actually told me to use coconut oil on my nipples for dry cracking. I forget if you are having a girl or boy but Vaseline and small gauze come in handy post circumcision. Also I used depends instead of monster pads this time and it was so much better.
234 2018-11-25 23:40:11 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
235 2018-11-25 23:40:11 쌓아둔 재능은 땅 속의 기름과 같다. 퍼내지 않으면 어둠이 가득할 뿐이다. <파리팡세>The talent not using is like oil in the soil. Otherwise, darkness will be full.
236 2018-11-25 23:40:10 CBD oil the same as cannabis ?
237 2018-11-25 23:40:07 Actually its antigravity but the government wont bring it out yet cause oil companies would go out of business...(tgj)
238 2018-11-25 23:40:01 I like organic argan oil or you can try grape seed oil. Both great for the skin and face.
239 2018-11-25 23:39:58 My mom told me my dad was an oil rig operator in Alaska which makes sense that he would want to live in a place where he didn't have to see his Sun 6 months of the year.
240 2018-11-25 23:39:56 Are you listening to the  people waiting for you to react to the Saudis so justice can be served. I guess not TDAP (you) is more interested in oil prices. You pick and choose the things that you find reason to talk about. Flip Flop that's all you do or pick on reporters.
241 2018-11-25 23:39:49 Trump says his good relationship with Saudi Arabia is why oil prices are low. 

Gas prices are 35% HIGHER than when Obama left office.

Selling America’s soul for low gas prices is a travesty.
Selling America’s soul for Trump’s wallet is an impeachable offense.
242 2018-11-25 23:39:23 Trump says his good relationship with Saudi Arabia is why oil prices are low. 

Gas prices are 35% HIGHER than when Obama left office.

Selling America’s soul for low gas prices is a travesty.
Selling America’s soul for Trump’s wallet is an impeachable offense.
243 2018-11-25 23:39:21 I'm a native so I have a good idea of the high gas prices vs the avg prices out here. Trump's sanctions on Iran have increased our gas rates. Analysts have discussed this since May. Oil prices reached 4 yr highs in Oct. Cali gas prices are affected by these things too.
244 2018-11-25 23:39:20 some oil xfxfchhhh
245 2018-11-25 23:39:11 And manipulating oil prices from Saudis and Trump isnt?
246 2018-11-25 23:39:08 The obvious and most simple remedy is vaseline, but there are alternatives.

-DON'T LICK YOUR LIPS

-Almond oil
247 2018-11-25 23:39:08 I like oil prices being low. I don't give a flip about who they murdered until someone in our freaking government stands up and does something about Hillary allowing our men to be left behind at Bengazi. Shut up and stop being a freaking coward.
248 2018-11-25 23:39:07 Ah yes. The free oil “tax cut” haha
249 2018-11-25 23:39:06 I'm a big proponent of getting off of oil.  This is not about product but outright fraud.
250 2018-11-25 23:39:06 dunno but you should ask a palm oil production expert
251 2018-11-25 23:39:00 The largest sources of U.S. imported oil were: Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%).
252 2018-11-25 23:38:58 Yes your precious oil that you won’t condemn a Saudi for murder
253 2018-11-25 23:38:49 it reversed already. i feel no big money will go into oil lest there is 15$+ upside. and @realDonaldTrump is saying he wants it at 40/50 and Saudis do fear him. i think true salvation can only come from US producers lobbying Trump or a very defiant OPEC. so far we have none
254 2018-11-25 23:38:49 Does human life mean nothing to you? Your priorities are badly skewed! We import most of our oil from Canada. Your rationale is wrong too!
255 2018-11-25 23:38:49 #Oils down because he gave Saudis a pass on the Prince Murder Case . And we are now big producers of oil .
256 2018-11-25 23:38:41 それしか言ってないの草
257 2018-11-25 23:38:41 Because the oil and coal companies are altruistic! 
258 2018-11-25 23:38:38 The “oil industry” position seems to be that any investment in anything else is an attack on oil. There is no price crisis, except that the price of a critical input is almost completely dependent on despotic governments we don’t control. The answer is to diversify.
259 2018-11-25 23:38:36 Make sure you get the oil stain off the concrete
260 2018-11-25 23:38:32 Lisa does she have oil heating aswell ?? She can get a oil fill threw SVP, they fund a one off fill, the circumstances are more than enough to qualify im sure.

265 2018-11-25 23:37:58 Its the oil prices that dropped not by the Carbon tax, which isn't a tax
266 2018-11-25 23:37:56 No matter who is @POTUS at any given year, Pentagon still bombs and terrorizes defenseless and poor countries that are rich in minerals and oil, covertly and overtly. #Yemen #Congo #Syria...ETC...
267 2018-11-25 23:37:52 Oil prices are based on trading at Cushing,  Oklahoma
268 2018-11-25 23:37:49 and that Oil crisis is quite recently, before that - and during Chavez administration - they had so much money they would literaly give it away to other countries
269 2018-11-25 23:37:48 600Mil for media is going to look like peanuts  !   JT will come running with OUR cheque book, but nothing for oil industry to power these cars ? So much for his "vibrant "strong  economy/touted record low unemployment  BS

-Rub Aloe Vera on your lips

-Avoid spicy or salty foods, they dry your lips
271 2018-11-25 23:37:43 You have absolutely nothing to do with a world wide oil supply!!! You are not that significant!!!
272 2018-11-25 23:37:32 Really dear Spanky. It seems that you are equating the murder of a journalist to lower oil prices. Your logic is as childish as your tweet. Thanks for the fed to keep an arrogant fool like you in check. You really ought to seek out medical care. Your 3 billion net worth allows it
273 2018-11-25 23:37:29 Canadian gov't bought a pipeline that doesn't produce oil, gave billions to Bombardier who just layed off 5,000 workers, & now after giving Chrysler & GM $10 billion in subsidies during the fiscal crisis they are leaving Ontario.  Good work everyone. #canpoli #onpoli

275 2018-11-25 23:37:08 And during Katrina oil prices were relatively low but gas prices set records that still stand.
276 2018-11-25 23:36:54 your out-dated data assumes Iraq would stop pumping oil. saudi can't do that
277 2018-11-25 23:36:53 They have to say that in public, cause they are not qualified to give qualified factual based info about climate science..
It's their way of saying they don't rep.. the people or the scientific community but the oil lobbyists the put money in their bank accounts..
278 2018-11-25 23:36:51 I believe the original idea of the invasion was to charge Iraq for US military intervention and that oil would be involved. Pretty much how colonialism works.
279 2018-11-25 23:36:51 I'm so glad you're asking these questions. This is especially true of the oil industry, eh? Can you imagine a country buying a $4.5 billion pipeline for a product all non-Cdn oil co.s have divested from because it's a crappy, sunset business model?
280 2018-11-25 23:36:43 Their crisis only happend because they relied completely on Oil, which had a downfall in it's price fucking up the entire country
281 2018-11-25 23:36:41 It is. But in the same way we no longer burn whale oil, we don't need to burn fossil fuels anymore. We already have viable renewables to replace it, we just need to invest in scaling it up. The only reason we aren't is because very wealthy people are making a lot of money still.

283 2018-11-25 23:36:40 Trump says his good relationship with Saudi Arabia is why oil prices are low. 

Gas prices are 35% HIGHER than when Obama left office.

Selling America’s soul for low gas prices is a travesty.
Selling America’s soul for Trump’s wallet is an impeachable offense.
284 2018-11-25 23:36:35 America is in Russia’s pocket, “he” also has strong political and financial backing, lastly the country(s) he owns/runs/dictates too has a lot of what the modern world desires (oil) so let’s not think this is about anything other than money. Nothing will change positively.
285 2018-11-25 23:36:34 Let your batter sit at room temperature for two hours before you cook them, and get your oil HOTTER THAN THE SUN.
286 2018-11-25 23:36:28 yeah, they said the exact same thing when I was a kid and they were warning us that by 1990, the last drop of oil would be burned and before the year 2000, the world would be a frozen wasteland with glaciers over the great lakes and the only arable land at the equator
287 2018-11-25 23:36:27 IRAQ should pay America with oil for us attacking them for Saudi Arabia..am I reading that right?
288 2018-11-25 23:36:23 Sana oil 
289 2018-11-25 23:36:14 Remember he advocated taking their oil early on......wow, a thought that actually stayed with him...
290 2018-11-25 23:36:11 It's so simple! Hitman takes place after the bad ending of Dishonored. All rat poison is made from whale oil.
291 2018-11-25 23:36:08 No, wet behind the ears political novice, can threaten the UK over fishing or anything else; foolish, childish, self seeking, grow up. British fishing territory is British, May may have given into EU bullies, but the commons will not, only inept fools pour oil on troubled water.

294 2018-11-25 23:35:56 + oil price is dropping, expenditures in Syria & Ukraine continue, and internal Russian pressures are increasing
295 2018-11-25 23:35:33 Rich is relative.  I like Norway, but everyone knows oil is a big part of their economic success in recent years and that it's ultimately temporary.   This informs ALL of their consumption choices, not just health care, and the choice is largely out of the direct hands of HHs.
296 2018-11-25 23:35:33 When I was a kid, classic Italian sub w/oil, salt, pepper, oregano. As I got older I got weird... grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, sweet peppers (or banana peppers) on a kaiser saturated w/red wine vinegar 

Now, I’m a GF weirdo, & really dig their burrito bowls!

297 2018-11-25 23:35:31 How do you think we should handle the current problem we are having with the palm oil production and the problems it's causing the affected wildlife? Is there a better way to harvest that isn't as destructive, or are there perhaps alternative products we could use instead of it?
298 2018-11-25 23:35:18 No, I said he prevented further oil exploration around the US coast in 2016. His other improvements came over his 8 years in office. Backed by the GOP as well, since they had the government for a lot of his time.
299 2018-11-25 23:35:17 Oil was 53 when u took office.  Your drove it to 84. Now you’re taking credit for bringing it back down yet it’s still over 53? Remember while your core base believes anything you tell them, the rest of us read.
300 2018-11-25 23:35:17 Pope is stealing Biafra oil to maintain the church in Rome and to settle lawsuits against the catholic bishops and priests who molested little boys. You know catholic church is an  incubator for gay and pedophiles.
301 2018-11-25 23:35:13 Hope all the Americans living in TJ illegally can get to work tomorrow!!
#sosandiego #CommonSense   We oust large oil rich countries dictators like Iraq and Libya and talk about invading oil rich Venezuela but these people have to walk all the way to Mexico?
302 2018-11-25 23:35:01 the us military are killing people for oil while 9muses is fighting to give us our rights.......
303 2018-11-25 23:34:56 Since we get such a small percentage of oil from the Saudi’s who cares? The largest percentage comes from Canada.
304 2018-11-25 23:34:54 More like Ukraine wants to implicate itself into Azov oil/gas, but needs western excuses to gain moral insurance.
305 2018-11-25 23:34:54 Apply almond oil around the mouth to keep your lips supple and soften the lines.
306 2018-11-25 23:34:52 The thing is, we KNOW that oil is finite and is going to run out eventually. So why continue to burn it and run the world's most irresponsible science experiment on the atmosphere when we already have viable alternatives.
307 2018-11-25 23:34:50 I believe you earn your TOI amount. IMO he has been given more than enough opportunity to show his value and failed.  That’s not on the coach.
308 2018-11-25 23:34:42 Trump logic: We destroyed your nation’s infrastructure and unleashed a disastrous sectarian civil war that killed over a million people. Now, repay us by giving us your oil.
309 2018-11-25 23:34:38 News Flash: we are no longer dependent on Saudi oil
310 2018-11-25 23:34:35 You newest message about falling oil prices is only to CYA for siding with Saudi Arabia.
311 2018-11-25 23:34:34 I think your figures are well out of date...before the £8 bn revenue from oil turned into £500,000 or thereabouts.
312 2018-11-25 23:34:29 WW3 breaking out and OIL going to $0 duhhh
313 2018-11-25 23:34:28 Trump says his good relationship with Saudi Arabia is why oil prices are low.

Sirotkin came in 10th. Not really eye catching performance. Baku 2017 from 8 - 3 with 6 DNF's + Kimi oil leak. Lucky.

320 2018-11-25 23:33:57 Did the US not so long ago become a net exporter of oil, so a bit of loss there.  I suppose though cheaper gas prices will make up for about 1/10th of the cost rise due to the tariffs Trump have imposed without any advanced planning.

323 2018-11-25 23:33:50 "Diplomatic pain" is meaningless and absurd. Let's see Germany and other EU nations buy their oil and gas from the US vice the Russians. But you don't support that, do you?
324 2018-11-25 23:33:44 OPEC controls the price of oil. Not that Ahole in the WH. He wants you to believe he does.

327 2018-11-25 23:33:31 I pity the fool that don’t like my oil prices!
328 2018-11-25 23:33:29 Thanks for the invitation!

330 2018-11-25 23:33:24 It’s definitely weak of him. I thought America was strong enough to say “I don’t care about your filthy money” and you will pay for your crimes and keep oil prices down 
331 2018-11-25 23:33:19 Dope. US doesn't need there oil.
332 2018-11-25 23:33:15 Well at least you aren't subtle you thanked your self for oil prices which you can't control

Just imagine that fire and tell me again there is any doubt!
341 2018-11-25 23:32:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

343 2018-11-25 23:32:24 Are you saying his stopping drilling in 2016 lowered air pollution in 2017? Magic oil?
344 2018-11-25 23:32:20 If you dont tip though, it secretes hydrolic oil accidently into your next coffee
345 2018-11-25 23:32:16 He didn't do that to save the oil patch, he had to do that to save investment in Canada in any industry.
346 2018-11-25 23:32:15 Saudi owes you something big, so they drop the price of a barrel of oil. Blood money. I would rather pay more for gas and call them out for butchering an American journalist and a human being. SHAME ON YOU.
347 2018-11-25 23:32:10 The question becomes: do we want to run out of oil first, or do we want the world to run out of oil?
348 2018-11-25 23:32:09 You two are so boo boo boo, sports and nation boo boo boo, oil is down thanks to your hero Trump boo boo boo
349 2018-11-25 23:31:55 Nothing like hot oil splashing up in your face at work 
350 2018-11-25 23:31:48 @RickSantorum You are a joke. You think the scientists or the trees are profiting?!? How about coal and big oil??? That’s what I thought. The #gop gets millions from industry profiting on the back of the environment. Money is there but it’s not for scientists. #ClimateChange
351 2018-11-25 23:31:35 Remember when then Prez. W Bush said the Iraqi oil was going to pay for the war?!
352 2018-11-25 23:31:30 And there in lies the rub . No politicians with the stones to stand up to big insurance and pharma . That lack of conviction is why we all still put gad in our cares . Who wants to go after big oil . Big anything for that matter
353 2018-11-25 23:31:27 Who does max think he is putting olbas oil all over my pillows last night now I’m just here alone and it’s all I can sMELL
354 2018-11-25 23:31:25 You idiot..
It’s not about buying from or selling to..

Saudi Arabia is the only country that can compensate for the demand for oil, especially after the Iran sanctions, you don’t want to pay 20 times the price of gasoline per trip in the car
Got it?
355 2018-11-25 23:31:23 The threat that Saudis retaliating w hiking oil prices seems real to folks still stuck in 1979. I’m surprised how many there are. Also—anyone remember where most 9/11 criminals were from and who funded them?
356 2018-11-25 23:31:20 Oil prices have changed before & will roller coaster again & again.

June 2014, price of crude was up around $115 per barrel.
January2015, crude prices had fallen by more than half, down to $49 per barrel.

Fluctuations in crude production & prices happen but not because of Trump
357 2018-11-25 23:31:18 These guys are hopeless and haven’t done anything for years

Gas makes up a small portion of their revenue and reserves so given oil price collapse they will be hurting

Also has no high impact drilling on the horizon either

Yawnnnn
358 2018-11-25 23:31:10 Charles, when you have been blessed wirh the largest oil field outside of Saudi Arabia and you have a PM that actively does not want Canadians to benefit. That is stupidity. Albertans have every right to be angry.
359 2018-11-25 23:31:05 How to get the dewy look for foundation without turning into an oil slick

363 2018-11-25 23:30:51 Plummeting prices, down 23% since 3 October, have finally prompted Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, to move to cut its shipments by half a million barrels per day in December due to seasonal lower demand.
364 2018-11-25 23:30:48 The Fed isn't listening--they're doing. You got nothing to do with oil prices...unless you bomb Iran. So, what's taking you so long?!?

368 2018-11-25 23:30:41 Great thinking @WBrettWilson 

1. Approve pipelines
2. Our steelworkers make pipe
3. Our contracts lay pipe
4. Our oil moves through pipe
5. Our rail moves grain instead of oil.

Canada steel, construction, oil, agriculture and taxpayers all WIN!

What am I not seeing?
369 2018-11-25 23:30:40 Just change your oil every time you have to get new tires, you’ll be fine

374 2018-11-25 23:30:12 No sadder than the deliberate wind down of oil and gas in Alberta by our PM.
375 2018-11-25 23:30:10 The group of First Nations that you are berating are not opposed to the responsible extraction and shipment of oil and gas. What's wrong with wanting to be financially independent?  Would you like having to rely on daddy for an allowance for your whole life? Yeesh!
376 2018-11-25 23:30:09 Right!?! And how many of those ‘defense’ dollars are just needed to secure the oil spigots in the Mideast?
377 2018-11-25 23:30:09 People used to use boiling oil to keep people away
378 2018-11-25 23:30:00 No it won't. We import a tiny percentage from that backward ass place. Want oil prices to go down? Invest in renewables. They will look at soon to be worthless sludge in a whole new light.
379 2018-11-25 23:29:59 Funny how, in a convo inspired by Huemer's principles of good faith, everyone is snarkily using a most literal definition of paid shill & acting like they've never seen such a thing

Clearly, the concept was meant to cover stuff like CATO papers, oil company climate reports, etc.

387 2018-11-25 23:29:23 Are you aware that thousands of people died and millions have been displaced because the climate is now unstable. Do you know why? The oil companies know. The top ten studied this together in the eighties. Then they started finding ways to distract people from the facts.
388 2018-11-25 23:29:19 それ俺っすw
389 2018-11-25 23:29:18 Dear Senator, how do we make oil & gas giants like Exxon pay for this climate change solution?
They have known of the ill effects of global warming caused by fossil fuel use & have raked in billions in profits for years, not to mention tax breaks. They should be held accountable
390 2018-11-25 23:29:15 You all have children? In 10 years they will be dealing with some major problems. It's accelerating, we need to change out lifestyle. Plastics, oil, chemicals. There is a better way. We might feel the pinch in 2021 and will prompt people to shit themselves when its too late. 
391 2018-11-25 23:29:12 Gee, I don't know. Seems you and your kind put the blame on Obama when gas prices hit $3/gallon.

News flash: You don't control oil prices. Supply and demand and OPEC do.

393 2018-11-25 23:29:02 The shit is about to hit the fan.  If people don’t wake up to what globalism has done and is doing, we are finished. We are already on the edge. One little push...oil down, taxes up, what will be the ultimate catalyst?  Canadians should be worried #Cdnpoli

404 2018-11-25 23:28:24 Show me the rich climate scientists. 

Then show me the rich oil barons.

Which one was easier?
405 2018-11-25 23:28:05 The roads, tunnels and bridges of #Norway  save lives. #Scotland, with bigger oil and gas reserves, struggles to dual the deadly A9 and builds cheapskate causeways for its islanders.  inevitable in the #UK. 
406 2018-11-25 23:28:02 Better nationalize the auto sector truddy you've already killed oil industry
407 2018-11-25 23:27:57 Do you realize how much oil the US produces now? Of course now. We export oil now. Meaning we don’t need their oil. But believe the hype
408 2018-11-25 23:27:53 Someone who can't tell us what the closing price on crude oil futures will be 3 months from now, tells us to worry about the GDP in 2100.  Go figure....
409 2018-11-25 23:27:53 the moron is only worried about his Selfies, I'm sorry tour, open borders, paying terrorists millions, his fake feminist agenda-while basically shutting down the oil industry & dropping the ball on the auto industry by screwing up NAFTA by acting tough against a bully like Trump
410 2018-11-25 23:27:52 Rick Santorum is driven by the big oil contributions he receives so he tries to deny science to satisfy his donors.
411 2018-11-25 23:27:49 So misguided, hanging on to oil and carbon as if their lives depended on it. McConnell and his 11 angry men just want to be rich in the present day..to heck with grandchildren.
412 2018-11-25 23:27:38 Response: No shit, but you are a paid schill for the oil industry.
413 2018-11-25 23:27:35 You have nothing to do with dropping oil prices. Stop making crap up. All you do is blow your own horn. You have done nothing for the middle class in this country.
414 2018-11-25 23:27:24 I just get them from the health food shop individually! Jojoba oil comes in a brown 50mm or 100mm bottle and the essential oils will last ages cause you’re only using a few drops of each per full bottle of jojoba oil. I just drop the essential oils straight into the jojoba oil...
415 2018-11-25 23:27:06 わかってんじゃねえか豆しば その通りだよ
416 2018-11-25 23:27:02 Isn't it more a case of oil companies monopolising crude prices & then competing against each other to raise or drop bowser prices when need is or suits? More often, they go down a few cents only a short time before they are raised many more. POTUS controlling the price of crude?
417 2018-11-25 23:27:00 Wtf are you talking about? You need to stop watching Fake news. We get the majority of our oil from Canada. So no we will not tank. What HE has done is sell out the office of the White House to the highest bidder.
418 2018-11-25 23:26:59 Is there a technique to use oil (In this case unused chainsaw oil) to stain wood furniture? Some leaked on a table and the colour is great. Is this a thing and is it safe?
419 2018-11-25 23:26:58 The Five Year Plans were brutal, but they took the USSR from being a backwards peasant economy to the world's second largest steel producer behind Germany by 1941 and the largest oil producer behind Texas. Had they not happened, Hitler would have beaten the Soviet Union easily.
420 2018-11-25 23:26:46 Does Ivanka have to get a divorce before marrying an Iraqi oil prince or can that norm be ignored. Of course there’s always Tiffany.
421 2018-11-25 23:26:45 Garlic and Oil pasta wit fresh garlic , shrimp , mussels , crabmeat  or Curry Goat wit white rice , side of cabbage or Mac & cheese  Y’all gotta help me
422 2018-11-25 23:26:37 Glut of oil on the world market,and that’s good oil West Texas intermediate sweet  WTI.Alberta tar crap is low grade that nobody really wants,the yanks buy it for cheap and just use it to blend.
423 2018-11-25 23:26:32 For a title that never sniffed daylight? Nah... Save that oil for something worthwhile my guy
424 2018-11-25 23:26:27 MA | BOSTON | HAZMAT | 600 WASHINGTON STREET | LEVEL 2 TIER HAZMAT NOW FOR HOME HEATING OIL IN BASEMENT OF STRUCTURE
425 2018-11-25 23:26:26 Feelings on CPD oil. If the NHS made it & supplied it through specialists, and everyone was placed on had ICP & people where amited for 2 to four days to record ops, side-effects, mental health and impact on people conditions. I would trust CPD oil.
426 2018-11-25 23:26:26 was it not bush that said Iraq would pay for the war with oil?
427 2018-11-25 23:26:25 I suspect traders will attempt to gun up Oil next week on grounds of the renewed Russia / Ukraine tensions. Later in the week they will then get monkeyhammered by the Gold Oil Ratio dynamic.
428 2018-11-25 23:26:10 i use shea moisture, creme of nature, & cantu cremes. oils i use are peppermint, argan, & tea tree oil; make sure they’re all organic though. lastly, i use jamaican castor oil.

430 2018-11-25 23:26:02 So you are ready to sell... 

...snake oil?
431 2018-11-25 23:26:01 Unlike RIck Santorum, who only receives well wishes and kind thoughts from oil companies, coal companies and energy utilities.
432 2018-11-25 23:26:00 Kinda puts a damper on the folks that think Trump is gonna make them bazillionaires by revaluing Iraqi dinar if Trump takes Iraqi oil. 
433 2018-11-25 23:25:57 That won't get your oil to tidewater.
434 2018-11-25 23:25:51 42% of US oil comes from Canada , only 8% comes from Saudi Arabia . Why the hell isnt he thanking Canada?
435 2018-11-25 23:25:51 Hahahaha cute!
436 2018-11-25 23:25:33 Yeah according to the scientists the end of the world is in 5 years every five years until it happens ! 

Stop using fossil fuels. Pay no attention to Fukushima , what palm oil alternative!  Renewable energy lobbyist don’t secure tax money to fund anti climate change science!
437 2018-11-25 23:25:32 Maybe Comrade Cortez, the energy expert , can tell us what the closing price on crude oil futures will be 2 months from now?
438 2018-11-25 23:25:28 (まだ引き摺ってる)
439 2018-11-25 23:25:25 I filled my truck up this weekend. I know Saudi oil is a tiny part of our imports; however, DJT’s lie about the costs being connected brought the realization that I filled up with blood. Each mile is fueled by #JamalKhasoggi ‘s blood. I’d rather pay more, thank you.
440 2018-11-25 23:25:23 I just saw a tweet that they are getting reports GM will closing their planet in Oshawa (haven’t seen it confirmed) 2500 FT jobs and I bet they still whine less than the oil industry types of Alberta.  Pisses me off to no end

442 2018-11-25 23:25:18 What the hell is going on in Lucas Oil Stadium?
443 2018-11-25 23:25:14 They were already eliminated in the quarter finals! But they’re great because they have committed so fully to their dumb gimmick. (Oil! Rose petals! Smocks! It’s just so completely realized.)
444 2018-11-25 23:25:13 Just wait till the US govt finds oil there

447 2018-11-25 23:25:09 N by those who decieved lied n killed us n them you talk of. Not 4 us not by or word or greed, not with most in th world relising,its about power n control of oil. Not for us by us or in the best interest of our crountry or us.its called opressive dictatorship by acts of treason
448 2018-11-25 23:24:54 "im not owned!  im not owned!!", i continue to insist as i take a top rope death valley driver for a 2-count for less than the cost of an oil change
449 2018-11-25 23:24:43 the price of the world's oil in 2019 will be determined by only 3 men...president donald trump...president vladimir putin...and the crown prince bin salman...
betcha...
450 2018-11-25 23:24:21 Tory EU referendum Tory EU deal, or the return to Independence that we never had to give up and would be wealthier than Norway, oil like time will help us to regain what's been taken yet treated with distain.
451 2018-11-25 23:24:11 Some people are finding it hard to let go of oil, and the power and money it brings them.
452 2018-11-25 23:24:08 While of no consolation, history will judge this class of evangelicals as the next generation of snake oil salesman peddling salvation for personal benefit while supporting those that promise not to challenge them.
453 2018-11-25 23:24:03 Less oil = Less Saudi Arabian control of the planet
454 2018-11-25 23:24:01 If you wish a more direct connection to climate change via following the OPEC oil crisis, look up Stanley Meyer. It's pretty intriguing.
455 2018-11-25 23:23:54 Use YOUR head, we only get a small percentage of our oil from SA. Gas prices have already skyrocketed. The stock market has lost big in the last several weeks. The economy is taking a downturn. How will kissing up to SA HELP us. Don't believe Trump. He lies.
456 2018-11-25 23:23:49 The axle is crooked, the coils on the left front tire are showing, an oil change is needed, the brakes work when they want... it has good gas milage tho
457 2018-11-25 23:23:38 Takeaways from my weekend in NYC
- Saturday after Black Friday on SoHo was ok !
- NYC is the absolute worst when it rains
- One can never have too many black articles of clothing
- My body cannot handle 3 consecutive spicy noodle meals full of chili oil 
- I spent too much $ ugh

459 2018-11-25 23:23:28 As I sit here cooking the question aroused in my mind...  what makes oil Virgin?  Was it not passed around the block in some Itslian vilage as a teen? Or was it and now lying to is so we will feel goog using it?
460 2018-11-25 23:23:26 Correct me if I am wrong, but don’t the oil companies benefit from the recent financial update announced by Morneau?  That’s was pretty good tax write offs they get.
461 2018-11-25 23:23:25 #cl_f st long scalp oil
462 2018-11-25 23:23:23 Chevron & Exxon knew back in the 1980’s about climate change & buried the report. To them it’s all about profits, to hell with survival of the earth & people! Guess they forget climate change affects EVERYONE, including CEO’s of oil co’s! #ClimateChangeIsReal #SaveOurEarth
463 2018-11-25 23:23:21 Oil leak sounds such a crude failure sorry for Prerre well, I hope this one is last harmful disappointment I have GIANT POWER OF DREAM next season 
464 2018-11-25 23:23:17 Screw the economy! You can't live on a dead planet. You can't feed your children during droughts, wildfires, floods, and hurricanes. You can't eat or breathe money. The economy be damned. Time to blow up the oil economy with zero point energy generation. Tesla had the answers!
465 2018-11-25 23:22:59 Yes, but that's a reflection of low permanent income levels conditional on GDP.  They're going to *need* those reserves not to have material living conditions collapse when their temporary income source (oil) starts to dry up.
466 2018-11-25 23:22:58 Carrot oil.
467 2018-11-25 23:22:46 I used to have loads of hair which was quite fine but Lyme is taking it am now taking some black cumin oil capsules for immune system which hopefully will help the hair & skin
468 2018-11-25 23:22:46 More goes to producing diesel for home heating oil this time of year. Gasoline reserves see no dramatic increase. The price drop is because winter blend gasoline is cheaper to produce.
469 2018-11-25 23:22:42 Always has & always will, comes down to one word “OIL”
470 2018-11-25 23:22:41 My boyfriend likes to cook his own recipes so for dinner he made us pasta with olive oil, with a splash of spicy ranch and over cooked ground venison topped with melted cheddar cheese..
471 2018-11-25 23:22:37 Does Ivanka Trump have an oil company too?
472 2018-11-25 23:22:11 You forgot Scotland and Scottish oil reserves.
473 2018-11-25 23:22:03 Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, so your opinion isn't driven by money, oil and coal? A bit of a hypocrite aren't we?!!
474 2018-11-25 23:22:01 thought i was getting a whole new whip as long as walmart took just to do this oil change  i’m pissed I accomplished nothing
475 2018-11-25 23:21:50 Conservative logic: The government giving tax breaks to the oil and gas industry is NOT a subsidy and the left needs to stop describing them as such, but the government giving tax breaks to the media IS a subsidy and the left needs to stop describing them as tax breaks.

478 2018-11-25 23:21:25 Of course he is responsible. He backs the Saudi crown prince. In return they lower  the oil price. You do me a favor and I do you a favour. Your socalled president breaks the nuclear deal with Iran and he gets a very profitable arms deal. We call this corruption.
479 2018-11-25 23:21:23 #LGBTQwrimo This year, I've learned that I love my bi FMCs more than ever, and also that creative flow problems are okay. Days off are okay. It'll get done, but it's not worth burning the midnight oil.
480 2018-11-25 23:21:18 Russia needs Crimea, that is how it's exporting oil.
481 2018-11-25 23:21:15 Sometimes that must be a job for landlords rather than the local authority.
482 2018-11-25 23:21:15 of isolated tribes succumbing to disease was after major contact with outsiders i.e. the only major case of this was a Peruvian tribe that was half wiped out after hundreds of oil speculators visited their tribe.  But all that aside, the Sentinalese do not know that they are just
483 2018-11-25 23:21:00 RETWEET if you are PROUD that Texas is #1 in America for oil & gas production
484 2018-11-25 23:20:54 The moment that we switch to alternative energies, the weapons dealers won’t have anyone to sell their weapons to anymore.  

The moment that we switch to alternative energies, the oil countries lose all power and their bloody wars stop.
485 2018-11-25 23:20:49 Could be worse, my Dad refers to SEO as “snake oil” despite the fact I’ve worked in it for a decade and made people millions ... always great around the holidays

491 2018-11-25 23:20:02 Yeah, Russia is on a razor's edge right now. Current oil prices aren't going to help & more US capacity is coming online. The Russian economy is a "one trick pony" being wholly dependent on oil & gas.
492 2018-11-25 23:20:02 Oil, gasoline, fracking, 19th century energy source -well 20th century was when it became prevalent- and extremely polluting & toxic extraction method. Hmmm, Texas will be doomed that way. Great Britain lost its might right along with coal. Solar, wind, next generation nuclear!
493 2018-11-25 23:19:30 I think Wolfowitz said something like "The oil will pay for it."

He also said "We will be met with flowers and candy."
494 2018-11-25 23:19:28 Today's oil rich Arabs were until very recently stateless, roaming the desert and living in camel skin tents, not sure they should be at the table with civilised nations.
495 2018-11-25 23:19:21 Who never wants us to be independent and switch to alternative energies?  The Saudis.

The minute the world is energy independent, the oil wars stop and the power of the oil countries dies.   

If you are anti-alt energies, your brain has been washed by the Saudis.
496 2018-11-25 23:19:20 Sushi is so good why do you have to be a Saudi oil owner to be able to buy it
497 2018-11-25 23:19:16 CRUDE OIL AND STOCKS

Oil down and Stocks up. It makes sense.

Oil up and Stocks down. It makes sense.

Any other scenario, it makes no sense.

501 2018-11-25 23:18:38 Very cute to watch you try to get it I’m sure.
502 2018-11-25 23:18:35 My Gma is mad at me for taking an oil that she NEVER uses and I - ...the stinginess is absurd.

I have met really wealthy oil lobbyists.

512 2018-11-25 23:17:36 Trump's real politik and lack of ethics is hilarious, but there's a little  on one shoulder saying "take the Saudi armaments money" "take Iraqi War reparations in the form of oil dividends" "Ukraine and Russia can Duke it out, sell them both some weapons" "take the $$"

524 2018-11-25 23:16:49 I feel bad but by the same token it’s likely that the oil patch issues fully exacerbated by Trudeau, have resulted in job loss in the hundreds of thousands.  @jkenney @PremierScottMoe @AndrewScheer
525 2018-11-25 23:16:45 Thanks for educating your readers about the huge discount Western Canada Select heavy oil trades at vs. WTI. The headline was not quite correct. It should have read: “Rail supply of Canadian...” [not Brent] “...crude offers Canada a pipeline to the future”. #CrudeOil #canpoli
526 2018-11-25 23:16:32 once i get the motive to weight lift, find my uncle toms tres leches recipe, do all my pre cal homework, and change the oil in my car ITS OVER FOR YOU HOES
527 2018-11-25 23:16:32 Really? Every time the price of oil jumps, us saps addicted to it pay out and when the price goes down we all have bail out the industry. Happens every time. ... not to mention the billions of annual subsidies. Oil sucks and it’s time to divest
528 2018-11-25 23:16:30 You know home heating oil goes up every winter and gas prices go down right? Or is this your first time at being stupid?

531 2018-11-25 23:16:23 C'mon that's a stretch. The market has been the biggest driver of the declining gas prices. Canada could be energy dependant and a huge exporter if it wasn't for our federal government's incompetence... instead we buy middle east oil. And make Canadians overpay for petrol.

536 2018-11-25 23:15:59 The price of a barrel of oil was $53 when Trump took office. Trump, Putin and the Saudis drove it up to a high of $82. Recently it has come down from those highs, but has been above $53 for most of the time he has been in office. Thanks for nothing!
537 2018-11-25 23:15:56 oh my goodness! Thank you! I haven't heard of Jojoba oil, or mixing. Do you buy them all individually from one brand and how do you mix them together?
538 2018-11-25 23:15:46 denke seit wochen nur noch an den juice aus vinegar und olive oil
539 2018-11-25 23:15:29 Mag pa hot oil ko karun bay
540 2018-11-25 23:15:20  love how hyped you’re getting. The motor oil is most definitely the grossest lol yet so effective
541 2018-11-25 23:15:12 Frankincense Essential oil around the eye does wonders!!! Warm compress throughout the day as well...
542 2018-11-25 23:15:00 We are no better than Saudi Arabia when it comes to oil, weapons, profits, genocide. We just gotta stop it really. The people are oppressed by these deals. We’re just as bad.
543 2018-11-25 23:14:59 It helps when they are sprinkled in the lawn as the squirrels tend not to dig there - but if they do, try red hot pepper flakes/oil/spray on the planting spot, Mean, but effective.
544 2018-11-25 23:14:55 oil very skittish... some quants would love to squeeze out all the stops below $50. c if they get there
545 2018-11-25 23:14:49 Aw did baby tRumpy need a pat on the back Again? Yeah not getting one. Someone needs to explain to you where the majority of our oil comes from these days. You're so moronic in your small minded knowledge. READ. EDUCATE. LISTEN. LEARN. Maybe they can get you pics #SmallMindTrumpy
546 2018-11-25 23:14:46 Starlight Traveler yeah it feels like a motorcycle i get castor oil for a lot!!
547 2018-11-25 23:14:45 Moats, alligators, burning oil, concertina wire, search lights, German Shepherds. And if that doesn’t keep them out we should resort to stronger measures.
548 2018-11-25 23:14:37 You spent for 40 years to keep taxes down and keep the conservatives in power.  Spent oil revenues,spent the Heritage Fund, never saved for a rainy day like Norway.  Now your rainy day is here, and you bus in people to protest what is no one’s fault but your own.
549 2018-11-25 23:14:36 Their the 7 main oil companies that have spread greed war poverty around the world
550 2018-11-25 23:14:18 she didn’t want the oil and vinegar dawg
551 2018-11-25 23:13:56 But oil companies are not? You sound like a real "santorum"
Google it
552 2018-11-25 23:13:40 Awww so cute!!!
553 2018-11-25 23:13:39 The oil companies should be forced to dry out these lakes and safely store the remaining waste materials.
554 2018-11-25 23:13:39 On the plus side, if you're selling your oil in bitcoin, you're getting like the same amount that you were 6 weeks ago, so you know, that's a win, right?
555 2018-11-25 23:13:23 Not for oil dependent states!!!  Not for our over all budget deficit, not for the market, not for the environment!
556 2018-11-25 23:13:18 I wanna put a meditation corner in my room.. candles and incense, a mat, oil diffuser, Himalayan salt rock lamp.. I’m sure it’s some other things I could do to make it dope.
557 2018-11-25 23:13:10 That is basically at eye level with that hot oil oh my God !
558 2018-11-25 23:13:07 When attackers tried to break into English castles they were repulsed by pouring boiling oil on them.
The answer to all of this is to send the illegal immigrants the message that they will never be allowed into the USA.
Shut the border down.
559 2018-11-25 23:12:50 This is a beautiful photo. It's almost like a painting, or an oil pastel drawing.
560 2018-11-25 23:12:47 My Minister for Finance Entertainment and Shoes looked into opportunities for working as a photographer and found all these tricks for making food look a certain way. Motor oil. Hair spray, wood stain, the list goes on >>>
561 2018-11-25 23:12:38 Trump isn't owned by Saudi Arabia, he is an Ally to MbS, which is crucial. MbS cleared out all the Wahhabists from his govt. & wants to be an ally to the US. Hence the reason Trump allowed their oil industry to be listed on NASDAQ, our success is tied to their success. GENIUS.
562 2018-11-25 23:12:38 Make enough money, any way you can, to be ready to go long on oil in 1973. Cash out, buy apricot orchards around Mountain View CA.
563 2018-11-25 23:12:32 oil prices are good in pei. Ford is a duffus and doesnt understand people nor economics. he and trump are running through the fields smelling flowers, holding hands, and playing skip to my lou while the rest of us live in the real world.

565 2018-11-25 23:12:18 Iraq oil was taken over by American oil companies during the Iraqi war.
566 2018-11-25 23:12:18 Holiday Joy has just been added to the doTERRA Special Offers section! 

So many people loved this oil during our 12 sprays of Christmas workshop! 

It's only usually released at this time of the year so grab a bottle whilst you can!!
567 2018-11-25 23:12:10 Have you got beard oil?
568 2018-11-25 23:12:05 Could I volunteer to put some soothing oil on them
569 2018-11-25 23:12:01 Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me 

I guess now it’s just “gimme white people, Saudi oil and guns”
570 2018-11-25 23:11:58 It’s not much of a sanction when we import only 11% of our oil from the Saudi’s. Besides in America we don’t trade money for lives. A guy by the name of Judas did that. It’s called blood money.
571 2018-11-25 23:11:56 Yes oil prices are falling...but we are not seeing the drops at the pumps
572 2018-11-25 23:11:55 me: i’m col— 
marcell: why don’t you just stick your finger in the boiling oil it will warm you up
573 2018-11-25 23:11:39 Mr. President, you did nothing. You must have failed economics 101 and didn’t even go to any global forums. Demand drives fuel along with production. Over abundance of reserves with Americans conserving energy is one of many reasons oil prices are low. Please read!!
574 2018-11-25 23:11:30 JFC is if that were true and “America First” was actually a thing, why are WE still getting oil from Saudi Arabia and our gas prices outrageous!? As a matter of fact I remember the argument for pipelines and drilling on American soil, oil independence. Not hardly. We ship it out.

576 2018-11-25 23:11:13 Howard Marks famously said “there is nothing intelligent to be said about the price of oil.”

I’ve come to believe the same is true of bitcoin.
577 2018-11-25 23:11:11 For my birthday, I would like to get the following presents: a bottle of oil, a bottle of honey, and squirrels! 
578 2018-11-25 23:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: day-old crust with greasy motor oil and chicken.
579 2018-11-25 23:11:04 The Realestate industry in lebanon is not driven by the local economy or local politics  and is not waiting for local reforms or change.  It has been and will continue to be driven by oil money. We won’t see a recovery until the gulf economies recover and price of oil hits $80+
580 2018-11-25 23:10:56 I think teens want the same things adults want. The vapers want quality vapes, the cannabis users want what's popular in that market. Of course, hash oil is not legal or easily available everywhere, so I don't think that explains the whole increase in past-30-day use.
581 2018-11-25 23:10:53 I don’t know if I will leave Lucas Oil Stadium with all my hair  #HairPullingBowl
582 2018-11-25 23:10:53 The notion that low oil prices are dangerous is ridiculous. High oil prices only benefit producers and whoever is long in financial oil market. This current downturn in prices is for waning demand rather than supply issue.
583 2018-11-25 23:10:46 No it hasnt. They've just had major strikes near Shetland. They only run out the old lack of oil story to try and cow the Scots
584 2018-11-25 23:10:42 These are still Jim Lee. Lots of good information as an introduction to all of this stuff but still a diversion from the real activity like shutting down Canadian shipping lines & oil production, attacking Iceland, hitting Yemen & the Asian coastal areas...& on & on.

589 2018-11-25 23:10:20 The working man is screwed in Canada..oil in the west to manufacturing in the east.  Say what you want.. our government sucks.

595 2018-11-25 23:10:06 You do know we import 4X the amount of oil from Canada than Saudi Arabia, right?
596 2018-11-25 23:10:04 ~sweetie. What are you doing out here? {I rolled out from under the car, grabbing a nearby rag to wipe the excess oil from my hands.}
597 2018-11-25 23:09:55 Need a nap before late Oil game start
598 2018-11-25 23:09:54 {My focus on changing the oil of Rita's the soft music from the stereo humming through the garage, drowning out the sound of the shuffling of Devyn's feet. I caught her gaze out of the corner of my eye causing me to jerk forward, hitting my head on the frame of the car} Ah, hey~
599 2018-11-25 23:09:47 Yes, scientists who study the climate have their hands in the cookie jar and oil and gas lobbyists are true souce of information on climate change.
600 2018-11-25 23:09:45 We paid into the system 40-50 years. Politicians stole from the trust to fund VietNam and continue to hit it for Middle East oil wars. Stock market steals too, even when you aren’t an investor.
601 2018-11-25 23:09:42 Did you thank President Obama when oil prices were even lower than they are now? #twit

604 2018-11-25 23:09:22 Meh. 
I don't want stew.
I'm roasting them in olive oil with fresh herbs and garlic.

606 2018-11-25 23:09:14 @realDonaldTrump you lack both moral and ethical fiber. You sold out Jamal Khashoggi’s life for reduced oil prices. #deplorable
607 2018-11-25 23:08:56 tomorrow: Trump announces higher oil prices to make America greater again
608 2018-11-25 23:08:52 I have been so focused on meal prepping for my new #furbaby, I finally have a weekend for my own #selfcare.

609 2018-11-25 23:08:37 Yeah,  big accomplishment to crash the oil and gas industry.  Great job!
610 2018-11-25 23:08:36 i used coconut oil around my eyes to help apply my glitter on friday night.. and it burnnnned me. i have redness & am scabbing now  PSA: don’t do that!
611 2018-11-25 23:08:13 CocoaPink is good, Alkemia does strictly oil blends, but they are so good.... there’s more indie perfumers out there if you look. For the oils, they have to sit so the scent can settle, but I prefer EDT/EDP

621 2018-11-25 23:07:38 I have some products. Not beard oil though. Should I be using it?
622 2018-11-25 23:07:34 And the media will buy into his BS.  Let’s have a big discussion about “prez t” & oil prices.  The media knows he does this but they play right along with him.

624 2018-11-25 23:07:25 I am not happy with anyone on this panel. The first question should be to Billy K, what was Pearl Harbor?  Did Pentagon Audit have anything to do with that?
Then, what was Energy Policy Meeting of March 2001?  Why were Iraq Oil fields on map?
Your Swiss Ties?  
Next question?
625 2018-11-25 23:07:18 Everybody who has a cat knows how sandpapery their tongues are. In fact, I use my cat to take marks off the wall. I dab a little fish oil on the mark and then hold my cat up to it.   (This is a joke. No hate replies please.)
626 2018-11-25 23:07:14 And people still think  Broomberg  is pro- Tesla. Its just a propaganda tool for big oil

I’m going palm oil free so I’m hoping I’m not going to have to give you up 
628 2018-11-25 23:07:01 A long TD and turnovers on 3 consecutive snaps in the #Colts game today and it’s nowhere near the craziest final minute of a half at Lucas Oil this weekend.

@NPHSDragons up 14-6 w/ball own own 30 ... long run, TD pass, INT & Charlie Spegal breaking 7 tackles to the house, 28-6.
629 2018-11-25 23:07:00 .@realDonaldTrump Sieg Heil! "So great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T). Add that, which is like a big Tax Cut, to our other good Economic news. Inflation down (are you listening Fed)!"
630 2018-11-25 23:06:58 Also weed oil is now legal so staying mellow is easy
631 2018-11-25 23:06:51 Seriously.....is there any stadium noise in Lucas Oil?

@StampedeBlue - Is this just weird microphones or is that stadium just not built for noise?
632 2018-11-25 23:06:46 Gap up $OIL holding so far that T sync along with the weekly T.
633 2018-11-25 23:06:33 ...and I'm not saying we use all our oil. We don't because companies make more money exporting than selling domestically.
634 2018-11-25 23:06:27 @chasadee14 thinks it’s okay to put pure oil in my water cup and watch me drink it as she laughs her ass 
635 2018-11-25 23:06:25 I heard similar logic during sub-prime bubble.
Business isn't immune from irrational evaluation & decision-making.

And the interests of oil execs aren't the same as the interests of the Oil Industry, & neither necessarily reflect the economic (or other) interests of the nation.
636 2018-11-25 23:06:14 This is why I seldom watch CNN, placing a flack with Trump Talking points is not serious news analysis.  They should demand that their conservative balance use facts instead of lies (like the scientists are paid off).  They could say, R's don't care or we get our money from oil.
637 2018-11-25 23:06:14 頑張っていきましょ
638 2018-11-25 23:05:42 That’s coming from an American who has never actually been persecuted. We have tried to dominate the world/oil for the last 60 years, and they are fed up. Are they led by propaganda? Of course. But who put those people in power?We have to take responsibility at some point.
639 2018-11-25 23:05:34 lol I remember being at a talk where someone asked in the Q&A about this & whether we should share our oil revenues post split. I answered that we've shared them for quite long enough & it's time to put those resources to use for the benefit of the people of Scotland.
640 2018-11-25 23:05:32 Curious, then, that you are more concerned with taking on unions than with letting banks, oil companies, and the pharmaceutical & insurance industries dictate Democratic policy.
641 2018-11-25 23:05:30 should have the refineries right next to the oil sands ... and be suppling the products we need here from our own oil ...  not pumping everywhere for cents on the dollar - added value and sell at a premium
642 2018-11-25 23:05:28 Can someone please help me out on a cooking question? I am feeling hungry, I have no onions to cook with, but I can’t go out cos it’s really cold. If I cook chicken using oil only, will it at least taste like it’s edible?
643 2018-11-25 23:05:27 Or just picking you up. Which would require a firm grip on your butt... you know for safety!
644 2018-11-25 23:05:26 今週も頑張りましょう
ヨロシクです。
645 2018-11-25 23:05:16 I mean people in power wanted to steal the oil back then, too, they just want to do it properly through under the table deals, kickbacks, graft, bribery and tax evasion. And to do it quietly, of course.
646 2018-11-25 23:04:58 Exactly. I have some pictures & an oil painting my Mom did.......lots & lots of memories.
647 2018-11-25 23:04:49 Why would crude oil price rise if Russia attacks 2-3 Ukrainian ships?
648 2018-11-25 23:04:48 We didn't discuss policy. We discussed the viability of Alberta's oil industry, which you are skeptical of in spite of your rudimentary grasp of it's workings. The only threat to the viability of Alberta oil is from the nation to which we're unfortunately tethered. For now.

651 2018-11-25 23:04:24 Not everyone can take the BS
652 2018-11-25 23:04:19 Rex tillerson has interests here also. RU has been at war with Ukraine for years now. And they need the waterway to transport the oil. 

What is confusing to me is sept 2017 senate allocated $500million and weapons to Ukraine and U.S. was treating wounded Ukraine soldiers here.
653 2018-11-25 23:04:18 Yeah...and my oil stocks are in the TANK...literally and figuratively.
654 2018-11-25 23:04:11 Wading in to say if you ran out of oil and roasted the whole lot in melted butter it's a REALLY good time.
655 2018-11-25 23:04:08 Oh hog wash. Gas / oil prices are on the decline globally.

659 2018-11-25 23:03:49 So would you ban all companies from buying Saudi oil? Seriously, this is the only option you have but you won't as all your comments are just about saying look at me, look at me.

670 2018-11-25 23:02:52 probably a bandaid but lets pass the rumor around that it is a CBD oil patch.

676 2018-11-25 23:02:23 Yeah its true love as I can plant a soft kiss on her forehead without bending over 
677 2018-11-25 23:02:23 I keep the oil changed. There’s a leak somewhere. They won’t be able to find it until tomorrow though
678 2018-11-25 23:02:18 Climate change has been happening for billions years, it is not new. Until we have open debate about the issue, I tend not to believe snake oil salesmen trying to rip me off just for breathing air.
679 2018-11-25 23:02:13 Like the cold dank days of an austere childhood when you were given a spoonful of cod liver oil because it was good for you - I always refused it!!
680 2018-11-25 23:02:10 Did you actually just thank yourself!? We know the deal, "I will ignore the fact you are a murderer if you lower oil prices"
681 2018-11-25 23:02:10 In the jungle that space making is a problem. Palm oil growing creates mono cultures that harm all the nature around. Ever heard of the jungles as the earth lungs?
682 2018-11-25 23:02:03 And motor oil, and dish soap. Ew. I’d maybe eat the cardboard.
683 2018-11-25 23:01:56 Blair told me that if we went Indy the UK should forgive our share of the national debt due to our high oil revenues in the 80’s. My mouth nearly hit the floor!  I couldn’t believe that he knew almost nothing of our finances yet ran their campaign!
684 2018-11-25 23:01:52 The Leduc Oil Kings are chipping away at the @LethMAAACanes lead late in the second period of Alberta Midget Hockey League play at Nicholas Sheran Arena. The Canes were up 5-1, that has been trimmed to 5-3 with two unanswered Leduc goals. #yql
685 2018-11-25 23:01:42 US stocks have closed lower in a shortened post-holiday trading session as the energy sector tumbled on continued weakness in oil prices, and the benchmark S&P 500 confirmed its second correction of 2018
686 2018-11-25 23:01:30 You sold the soul of the USA and the death of a reporter to the Saudis just so you can get oil prices lower.
687 2018-11-25 23:01:12 Then where does the electricity come from? Coal oil and natural gas mainly unless your french
It's pointless to have a electric heater
688 2018-11-25 23:01:00 Out of 10 OPEC members, 7 of them have lower oil prices. Out of two types of oil Saudi Arabia produces those prices are up just over a half percent. Your taking credit for something that has been falling from before you took office. What's it going to cost Ontario people when
689 2018-11-25 23:01:00 Dear Theresa @theresa_may thanks for your letter I appreciate it but I’m Scottish you see -so I’m going to eat salmon, drink whisky, watch our oil fields flow and raise a glass to the fact my kids will be able to work/study in the EU and grow up free! #indyref2
690 2018-11-25 23:00:49 On the contrary I believe on that news oil will be up so as wheat
691 2018-11-25 23:00:40 I dont agree with every one moving to renewables, Sorry  fact just prove that. true  not every one in Ab is tied to oil but EVERYONE in the WORLD  IS tied to agriculture  & there is NO alternative that is currently viable
692 2018-11-25 23:00:39 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!

695 2018-11-25 23:00:09 Selects get a late PP of their own and tie it with 1:39 left in the 3rd.
696 2018-11-25 23:00:08 But wasn’t that part of the original obviously flawed) rationale? That we’d get their oil money?
697 2018-11-25 23:00:00 "Predominantly Western activism on the issue of palm oil has now successfully positioned the crop in the minds of many consumers as being in the same category as tobacco or fossil fuels." @maxwalden_ @LowyInstitute
698 2018-11-25 22:59:52 O I kinda added more spicy sesame oil PLUS an egg to the trader joe’s fried rice n I think I kinda snapped...it was so good wtf @ oomfies TRY IT!!
699 2018-11-25 22:59:49 Bullish oil if true #oott
700 2018-11-25 22:59:46 Dear Sen. Collins, if the President takes action against the Saudi Gov. they will retaliate by holding oil production to the US. Our gas prices will skyrocket, the economy will tank and everything he has done so far will be lost. Use your head and don't play politics.
701 2018-11-25 22:59:32 Yep. Literally blood for oil.
702 2018-11-25 22:59:29 Crude Oil - Over supply in the market has led to sharp decline of prices. Also due to the relationship between Saudi-US. Despite current bearish outlooks, when the market fundamentals prevail, OPEC will need to adjust its behaviour by restricting supply.
703 2018-11-25 22:59:27 No one. We give no one credit.  Oil is ALWAYS down after thanksgiving. Learn some history, NEXT!
704 2018-11-25 22:59:04 Basically, I am very skeptical in thinking he will fight effectively against big oil and the banks when he takes money from them.

He also takes money from telecom companies like AT&T (one of his top donors), how about Net Neutrality?

I also see a lot of healthcare donors. M4A?

706 2018-11-25 22:58:48 It’s acrylic mixed with a product called Liquitex (pouring medium) and a few drops of macadamia oil.
707 2018-11-25 22:58:38 The #Iceland campaign isn't promoting sustainable palm oil though - it's promoting a blanket palm oil boycott. Sustainable palm oil isn't the answer anyway - the biggest impact would be made by people going vegan, partly because so much #PalmOil is used in animal feed.
708 2018-11-25 22:58:37 Wanna crash oil prices? Crash the economy. GOPs love to crow about how how gas was like a buck a gallon when Obama was sworn in, but that was because oil had lost 75% of its value after the oil bubble of summer 2008 popped and the world was in the midst of Great Depression II.
709 2018-11-25 22:58:36 The @LethMAAACanes lead the Leduc Oil Kings 5-2 midway through the second period of Alberta Bantam Hockey League play at Nicholas Sheran Arena. #yql
710 2018-11-25 22:58:21 Yes, that is Henry James in snake oil salesman garb,
he is all talk about his cause, the "Great American Novel"
what then this national tie-in with greatness?

711 2018-11-25 22:58:16 And drilling a hole in the ground accomplishes what for mans progression into space?? Are we hoping to strike oil??
712 2018-11-25 22:58:11 Have walked along the beaches in Santa Barbara and if you wear runners you can’t get the clumps of oily tar off the soles.  Even worse if barefoot.  Interesting how you hear very little about that.....only Alberta oil.....  Wind turbines provide clean
713 2018-11-25 22:58:07 Bush promised the same we would get repaid with oil. Obviously he was just a war-criminal and was full of shit. #wmd
714 2018-11-25 22:58:05 my car desperately needs an oil change and I just spent like half of the money I made this weekend on my dogs’ christmas presents #priorities
715 2018-11-25 22:57:53 Worth noting that while yes, crude oil prices have taken a dump over the last week or so, they're basically recovering from a bit of a spike that's been going on all summer. Crude is just about back to where it was at the inauguration.
716 2018-11-25 22:57:50 Trying to integrate Islam with other cultures is like trying to mix oil and water. Impossible.
717 2018-11-25 22:57:47 Looool ...put oil in yuh lotion next time
718 2018-11-25 22:57:45 You have a better chance at convincing me you sold your upper lip to OPEC to get lower oil prices than making me believe the Ford government was the cause.
719 2018-11-25 22:57:43 We did invade Mexico. We kept the parts we wanted ^ gave back, the rest. Calif, Az, etc. are Mexico. 

In immortal words of S.I. Hayakawa 'We stole in fair and square & we're going to keep itl ' Still small minded to exclude previous owners.  We need 'em.

If we knew of the oil..
720 2018-11-25 22:57:27 Raw shea butter with neroli/jojoba oil is my go to.
721 2018-11-25 22:57:19 You can't blame it on oil try living without it.
722 2018-11-25 22:57:16 From my research on the 'net, Russia needs oil prices to be around $50/bbl just to maintain their economy. They're in real trouble when they start cutting their pension payments. Their oligarchs have "sucked" so much from the country & stashed it offshore that it's hurt!
723 2018-11-25 22:57:13 Buy the oil and boost Iraq economy and reduce shipments from Saudi Arabia which only count for 11/13 % of US oil imports
724 2018-11-25 22:57:10 Yes and that is why we should be all over BC. Every summer we are at the effect of their fires. When they are all over us when we have the most ethical oil in the world.
725 2018-11-25 22:57:07 Thanks...still confused I guess.  Is it expected non US oil producers will be pumping flat out and converting to gold?  Talk about this on periscope if possible.  Thx
726 2018-11-25 22:56:57 Can someone please tell me what the fascination is with Teatree oil? Want an essential oil diffuser for my bedroom, cuz you know, dog farts. But every oil set I’ve seen includes Teatree oil as a “favorite.” Would rather smell dog farts than that rancid crap.
727 2018-11-25 22:56:55 "deval of real money (oil) against gold" = $ value of gold will go much higher than $ value of oil. That's inflating commodities. Will Wipe out debts but will keep ownership of assets in the hands of few. Social governments everywhere. 

That's the 70s but worse.
728 2018-11-25 22:56:50 "THE OIL PRICES ARE TOO LOW, RIOT!"
729 2018-11-25 22:56:40 Low oil prices??????????????????????????
730 2018-11-25 22:56:33 Unless you work in oil in gas in: Texas, North Dakota, Colorado, Alaska, Pennsylvania...... because, you know, America produces it too. 

Just ask around one of your hipster coffee shops.

732 2018-11-25 22:56:27 I’d gladly be the oil guy
733 2018-11-25 22:56:26 So much to unpack there. How much you wanna bet dude doesn't even know that Saudi Arabia is not the main supplier of oil to the US?
734 2018-11-25 22:56:18 Well, I think there are some juuling teenagers out there, but I don't think it's a coincidence that 2018 was also the year California's huge legal recreational pot industry launched. Oil pens are everywhere, and some of the "JUUL copycat" products are actually mj devices.
735 2018-11-25 22:56:13 CIA told him MBS was responsible for the death of the journalist. Trump tells MBS to get oil prices to 40-50$ otherwise he’ll tell the world about MBS involvement. Oil lower, good for US consumer and inflation lower, allowing Fed to hiking
736 2018-11-25 22:56:08 In the month before Saudi Arabian officials murdered Jamal Khashoggi, Canada imported $290 million worth of Saudi crude oil, a typical month. With all grades of oil in abundance in western Canada, it's an embarrassment that Canada isn't doing more to get off Saudi oil.
737 2018-11-25 22:56:07 Oil prices falling is great?  Were you alive in 2007 or just forgot?
738 2018-11-25 22:56:07 I had really bad hormonal acne and i got it under control with vitamin E oil.

742 2018-11-25 22:55:45 'like a big Tax Cut'.  Is that in the place of the 'actual' tax cut that you promised before the midterms? And this glut of oil due to over-production that is driving prices down.  Have you been pumping this yourself PT?

746 2018-11-25 22:55:23 Alberta’s hatred of the Liberals and of the PM is really ludicrous. They seem to think he can wave a magic wand and they’ll be able to sell their oil at $60 a barrel! This is a global problem. The US is producing like never before, and our oil is harder to refine#cdnpoli
747 2018-11-25 22:55:16 I whole heartedly agree that a deal between governments for arms and oil does not give free pass for doing what you want. To suggest otherwise is asinine. However, ethnicity and religion don’t play a role here. I agree that this is unjustifiable and in humane. But bringing up
748 2018-11-25 22:55:15 TrumpDiabetes what does Venezuela have to do with a mixed economy? Ocasio Cortez is calling for a mixed economy similar to Scandinavian countries. Not nationalizing oil and all industry like has been done in Venezuela. Get out of here with your red herrings!

750 2018-11-25 22:55:10 How many champions league goals has he scored ?

How many against the big six ?

He’s played for Watford and Everton, two mid table teams with not a say in anything.

I don’t recall Richard Charles taking down the oil barons of City and PSG.


751 2018-11-25 22:55:07 So i think I burnt myself with oil...well no I did do it. It splashed and went on my hands and now they sting and itch...stupid me
752 2018-11-25 22:55:06 I find your comment stupid and irresponsible and I am not a Green voter. Drilling in the Bight is a great risk considering the lack of fast and efficient methods to clean up disastrous oil drilling.
753 2018-11-25 22:55:03 It doesn’t matter which president you worship, the Saudis own your asses. You all think there are sides and it’s the stupidest fucking shit I’ve ever seen.  

There are not sides, we are silly naive peasants!

End result always is US selling weapons to Saudis for oil and gas!
754 2018-11-25 22:54:55 Oil and gas infrastructure...
755 2018-11-25 22:54:48 @CNN I demand to know if Santorum has any ties to the oil industry? If he does you should disclose them.
756 2018-11-25 22:54:42 If you're an oil baron or a Trump, you have all you want, and more!

I've always wondered why those who already have it ALL get the big breaks too. Tax breaks, free hi-$ swag, you name it.

Folks who have less deserve an equal shot.

The rich claim they earn it.

It's a LIE. 
757 2018-11-25 22:54:38 President T also mentioned how he brought down oil prices and boosted our great economy...

767 2018-11-25 22:54:04 Some people say Trudeau is an incompetent fool. He knows exactly what he is doing. He set out from day 1 to blockade and break the the oil industry as well as to legislate and tax the the West and the rest of Canada into financial bankruptcy. He and his Cabal are plain treasonous

778 2018-11-25 22:53:40 #OOTT US oil rig count always reacts with a 4-5 months lag to big crude price moves, specially downward. So, if we bottom not too far from here, it goes from c. 900 now to 600 by April/May... and US production growth will decelerate massively from that point

791 2018-11-25 22:52:59 the craziest part about it is that if you did a radical shift in America to green energy, they would develop so many new jobs in recreating all their infrastructure to support it. It would be hugely beneficial for the American people. Just not great for oil interests.
792 2018-11-25 22:52:53 I guessing just nationalism at its best. Oil is dropping their economy will suffer. So all eyes on nationalism and national defense.

Historical precedent. Contemporary economic, and political situations across the Global South. Perhaps spend less time being patronising, and more paying attention to the world as it is.

Indigenous communities are suffering as we speak, due to the impact of oil.

808 2018-11-25 22:51:43 You know who else has lots of oil and doesn't chop people up?  Canada.  We're right here.  Make it happen!
809 2018-11-25 22:51:41 No one denies climate change or global warming. Placing the cause entirely on oil is foolish and not scientific. The axis shift of the polls 3 years ago is the greatest cause. City hot spots, ozone holes in the atmosphere, clear cutting, wild fires.. All play their part.
810 2018-11-25 22:51:38 Cuz you's ah snake oil gyal
811 2018-11-25 22:51:35 I got chai CBD oil cat treats for his anxiety

813 2018-11-25 22:51:20 What the hell is going on at Lucas Oil right now?
814 2018-11-25 22:51:12 If I cover myself - my whole body - with honey or oil, will the mosquitoes get stuck and I be able to kill them? 
815 2018-11-25 22:50:55 More bunk, Santorum is owned by oil.

817 2018-11-25 22:50:48 1. Lower gas prices are good for consumers
2. Lower gas prices are not good for US oil producers
3. It's a job killer
4. It's "like" a big tax cut?
5. Great! Since the supposed tax cut last year didn't actually pan out
#FuckingMoron
818 2018-11-25 22:50:47 Oh! I saw the question there now. Saudi Arabia needs oil & nuclear energy. Saudi Arabia is building a pipeline in Yemen & taking a port. This genocide & famine is for oil. They desperately need nuclear energy too so trump is helping. What is scary is them enriching Uranium
819 2018-11-25 22:50:43 my gate lock was all fucked from the weather so I couldn’t unlock it. But ya girl got street smarts and used MCT oil for low carb dieting to lube up the lock and got in ayyyeeee

821 2018-11-25 22:50:36 Subsidize all work means establish " living wage"(>15/hr) & gov't pays difference. Example-You work for XYZ 15/hr Living wage at 22/hr  Gov't pays difference to you.Who's the govt? We are Plus to convert from oil to wind/solar will require govt subsidy. Market driven? What's that
822 2018-11-25 22:50:35 life hack: cover yourself in johnsons bedtime baby oil before bed for super soft skin & a lovely scent to send you into a peaceful sleep 
823 2018-11-25 22:50:31 She is right. The alarmists’ ONLY prescription is massive government spending/taxation and they conveniently forget to as knowledge a huge contributor (water vapor) because that won’t destroy the oil/gas industry like they want to have happen.
824 2018-11-25 22:50:29 You aren't news, you're propaganda.
Show me exactly the legislation ford passed that directly led to this drop in gas prices. Furthermore demonstrate to me that it's not the obvious, causal reason - the plummeting price of oil worldwide!

You should but shut down. Lie hole.
825 2018-11-25 22:50:28 He did consider it. We are and will continue to use it as leverage. CHEAP OIL means Cheap gas & heat.  Saudi's killing Saudi's happens everyday. Why is this particular murder such a big deal Senator Susan Collins?
826 2018-11-25 22:50:20 Gonna try some Jamaican Black castor oil on my eyelashes 
827 2018-11-25 22:50:15 Thanks. Just getting a few bolts tightened and a change of oil. Good for a few more miles after that.

-Drink water
-Shower twice a day
-Rub Vaseline before you apply perfume
-Lotion right after you shower 
-Use shea butter and coconut oil lotion
-Use shampoo and conditioner that smell the same 
-Freshen up during the day
835 2018-11-25 22:49:44 Lower oil prices lead to lower gasoline prices which lead to lower federal fuel tax revenues which lead to rapidly decaying transportation infrastructure and pothole riddled roads.
836 2018-11-25 22:49:38 Man, they must be having a Thanksgiving weekend special on turnovers at Lucas oil @Colts #colts
837 2018-11-25 22:49:37 Lmao what the hell is going in Lucas Oil right now
838 2018-11-25 22:49:37 If they’re using palm oil in their cookies, cancel nyo na yan. Palm oil companies destroy orangutan habitat to harvest them.

840 2018-11-25 22:49:31 Well President Trump has to walk a tightrope on this issue. Such a terrible thing that reporter was murdered,,, which cannot be undone. But the US economy is still quite vulnerable to world oil prices.
841 2018-11-25 22:49:30 All that big money in climate science. WTF.  The big money’s in coal and oil.

843 2018-11-25 22:49:26 Some lovely fuckball going on at Lucas Oil

855 2018-11-25 22:48:32 I disagree, it was one of the few times he was honest and I respected it.  Yes he killed that dude, but we’re in bed for millions of dollars and he decides our oil costs so don’t expect a big reaction. Trump is America’s pimp and loan shark all at once.
856 2018-11-25 22:48:31 Sweeping generalisation. Not all countries are the same, not all States or forms of government. Going to be alot to beware of when the oil money starts flowing, but Guyana is going to change massively over the next decade. For good or bad? Who knows.

859 2018-11-25 22:48:17 I think he’s just telling another one of his lies but a lie he as very good personal reasons for telling to see that he keeps us in line.  Canada provides more oil than SA does and there is no justification for his attitude or decision other than personal gain.
860 2018-11-25 22:48:04 Insanity at Lucas Oil...
861 2018-11-25 22:47:42 That's not my point. Trump has been begging Erdogan to release a white preacher for a year. A Muslim journalist was ordered to be murdered by the crown prince and he has done nothing but talk about why we can't do anything because of the oil and arms deals.
862 2018-11-25 22:47:37 What is very clear to me is that it is no longer about labels. Genocide killed that for me. We all must reject systemic slaughter & profits. The labels are divisive. I think they keep us asleep to genocide. Profits off genocide & why there is genocide. Saudi Arabia wants oil
863 2018-11-25 22:47:16 I assume you also acknowledge that climate change skeptics are massively funded by big oil and energy?
864 2018-11-25 22:47:15 if thats the case i would look into scalp renewal shampoos. i just bought some from Not Your Mothers on ulta. adding a few drops of castor oil to your pump of shampoo can add moisture and help strengthen your hair as well

869 2018-11-25 22:46:32 Well over one million people disagree. It’s all about finding a sustainable source of palm oil and ultimately the main aim is to raise awareness which is exactly what we are doing 
870 2018-11-25 22:46:31 How about thanking Canada since we get most of our oil from them
871 2018-11-25 22:46:21 Try Hempz body oil in your hair
872 2018-11-25 22:46:20 Weird, seems to have disappeared. It was a thread about talking to a dinner party full of friends who came out with such gems as "Scotland wouldn't have its own coastal boundary, would have to share its oil fields & the border would be renegotiated". So much ignorance out there.
873 2018-11-25 22:46:20 Like an ethical version of those cut away models of oil tankers and airplanes but for cats #HowDoesACatWork
874 2018-11-25 22:46:09 What is uniting Nigeria is just the oil from the south. Human freedom is important than unity with oppression, marginalization, balkanization. GEJ should be allowed to express is mind. Nigeria is more corrupt, divided, in APC government led by PMB than PDP.
875 2018-11-25 22:46:08 You are DUMB!  Since the U.S still imports oil the OPEC Cartel still controls the flow.  Speculation will move the price.  No one person can control the price of oil.
876 2018-11-25 22:45:54 Oil prices may b falling,but food prices keep going up every week.
877 2018-11-25 22:45:20 So it uses words you don't like that are too advanced? You're triggered over what they're saying? Language police!  What a snowflake. 
878 2018-11-25 22:45:16 The country that created the biggest migration disaster in Europe with their wars for oil has the audacity to close its borders on immigrants... Even hypocrisy has its limits... The world had enough of American crimes
879 2018-11-25 22:45:15 Just to clarify, you are thanking yourself for low oil prices which are, in part, the result of you covering for a murderous prince.
880 2018-11-25 22:45:08 Texas will thank you for falling oil prices!!!

Prices are down anticipating a worldwide stagnation. Stockmarkets are down for the same reason.

You really achieved to darken Americas outlook in a couple of months.

Just in time for 2020. Let's get ready to vote!
881 2018-11-25 22:44:57 If someone starts out saying “I’m not a scientist “ they admitting they are accepting money from big oil lobbyists to spread disinformation
882 2018-11-25 22:44:53 It's the oil thingy
883 2018-11-25 22:44:52 食パンさん、おはようございます(^^♪
884 2018-11-25 22:44:50 I mean obviously the drop in price of oil is completely because of Trump........ 
885 2018-11-25 22:44:39 Pretty much. The approach is all wrong. 

Conclusion > Find Data that Supports It > Hide Any That Doesn't > Present Findings. 

It's like reading a report from a scientist employed by the oil industry on climate change. :D
886 2018-11-25 22:44:37 Yeah cause that’s what they are doing right? Putting big oil out of business? You missed my point he is complaining about lobbyists but everyone in congress belongs to a lobbyist an if you don’t believe that your delusional

888 2018-11-25 22:44:30 I don't know any gov't contractors, just hard working academics and many working in industry where either a oil well strikes petrol or not, the cleanup plan for pollution contamination works or not, independent of what they're paid.
889 2018-11-25 22:44:29 Cnrl is the one I feel the least sorry for they’ve taken full advantage of failing oil companies buying them for pennies on the dollar there proud of how cheap they are
890 2018-11-25 22:44:27 The thread started with me asking why the fact that Murdoch and Rothschild have invested in oil extraction in Golan was Anti Semitism to share the information. You have no valid response and have prevaricated, deflected and used absurd spelling mistake criticism.

892 2018-11-25 22:44:21 Guys! Can someone recommend me for oil free sunscreen?
893 2018-11-25 22:44:17 In VA at $.11/kWh my Model 3 costs about $8 per 300 mile vs about $40 for the BMW 3 series I sold, although due to my solar electric system that paid for itself in 3 years & earns me about $3000 per year in energy and SRECs, it is more than free! No more oil changes! So much fun!
894 2018-11-25 22:44:13 Khashoggi's paid for any lowering of price  (questionable ) in oil and only the upper 1% of America got a tax break. When middle America wakes up and realizes that they have been played we'll see what happens in next 2 years
895 2018-11-25 22:44:08 It's even scarier than cooking falafel in piping hot olive oil (I don't believe the Western hype against cooking with olive oil - my Palestinian ancestors have been doing it before the whites even thought about creating Israel)
896 2018-11-25 22:44:08 I’ve been keeping a money oil blend and citrine crystals in my purse to bring me wealth & so far it’s been working!
897 2018-11-25 22:44:00 Olive oil, a clove of crushed garlic, salt and pepper, hot ass pan.
898 2018-11-25 22:43:57 :)))))) maybe nothing if I fuck up with these oil pastels, lol.

900 2018-11-25 22:43:53 By what stretch of imagination does Pres. T take credit for oil prices down?
901 2018-11-25 22:43:52 @AdvanceAuto why is your website always so difficult? add the mobile + oil filter deal and the oil filters don't get added or appear as advertised. this is not the first time i've left frustrated. i'm done.
902 2018-11-25 22:43:49 Why, so you can bomb it & privatize their oil to gain control?
903 2018-11-25 22:43:38 He is trying to be kool, gas prices will come down, when the oil runs out, Sorry!
904 2018-11-25 22:43:33 How about we find out how much oil interests pay his DC lobbying business?
905 2018-11-25 22:43:32 The main opposition to Climate science is big oil, the most profitable entities on the planet. When you hear some scientist sweating away in a lab for peanuts is doing it for the money remind the idiot that Exxon has made $8bn a quarter for 10 yrs+
906 2018-11-25 22:43:25 Do you think he is partially or wholly responsible for lower oil prices?
907 2018-11-25 22:43:12 @Kytielee mng!!! I need to buy some sunscreen and I need oil free .Do you have some recommend for me?
908 2018-11-25 22:43:04 @POTUS I am so proud of the job you are doing for the United States Of America.. 
I am wondering what the low oil prices will do for jobs? 
All my family is employed in the oil Industry.. Pray they keep their jobs!!
909 2018-11-25 22:43:02 Do you carry CBD oil?
910 2018-11-25 22:42:52 @Baileys_GB Hi Bailey's, i absolutely love Bailey's, it's my favourite alcoholic drink, but I was wondering if it contains palm oil?
911 2018-11-25 22:42:48 The #calgary protests were not pro NDP, they were anti carbon tax. 

This was not an organic protest it was contrived by the #CPC & the #UCP to use a #oil prices crisis, to gain advantage politically by angering #Albertans into another false anti @JustinTrudeau narrative

912 2018-11-25 22:42:43 Crude oil could be interested.. a lot of people predict a rebound. Let’s see when markets open
913 2018-11-25 22:42:39 He Opened Up OUR OWN OIL RESERVES to drive down prices for NOT SANCTIONING THE SAUDIS.

KHASHOGGI'S LIFE IS WORTH MORE THAN THIS!!!
914 2018-11-25 22:42:37 Geopolitical risk , but go ahead panic sell oil
915 2018-11-25 22:42:30 "Yeah... Putin is a very fine person. Maybe he is a dictator and a bully to Ukraine but, in the other hand, look at oil prices!!"

917 2018-11-25 22:42:11 Just played: Foals - Snake Oil (What Went Down)
918 2018-11-25 22:41:52 Really? Which promise? 
To build the wall and make Mexico pay for it?
Or maybe to jail HC?
Or to release his Tax returns?
Maybe Repeal and replace?
Maybe raise taxes on rich?
Or to break up banks? Lower drug prices? Take the oil from Iraq? Maybe the infrastructure plans? ........
919 2018-11-25 22:41:50 He is trying to crush and nationalize the oil industry so he can give money not  just to other provinces to bribe, he will also give that money to other countries. He is a communist and wants the destruction of western capitalism. He will buy the oil sands with Soros and tax cash
920 2018-11-25 22:41:50 Not exactly sure what you're asking thanks for? You keep talking about oil prices falling yet when you took office the national average gallon for gas was less than it is now.
921 2018-11-25 22:41:48 I swear by Hempz products!!! I’m telling you , you need their body oil it’s AMAZING!!!
922 2018-11-25 22:41:47 If Trump wants to help the people, let him get the Saudis to lower the price of oil to ten dollars a barrel what it was before the shah came into Iran brought in by America and that was when the hate began!...
923 2018-11-25 22:41:47 What if we treat plastic like (FSC/PEFC) paper? Cut the oil reserve in so many parts as is needed to create oil. With trees it's 30 years so 30 parts. With oil it's 4.000.000 parts (?). What would it do to the oil price?
924 2018-11-25 22:41:43 Sigh. Boring AND stupid. dropping oil prices isn't the same thing as prices at the pump.  Any first year trader will tell you the falling oil prices isn't a great sign.  Jesus, what an idiot.  Recism really that important to you, MAGAts?  No smarter ones?  Pity.
925 2018-11-25 22:41:42 I know, right?? That was the worst one for me. I thought the hack was just the cardboard between the pancakes, only to left flabbergasted by the oil. 
926 2018-11-25 22:41:41 US does not need petrol from Arab states anymore.
She has plenty of their own. Actually they export oil.
927 2018-11-25 22:41:29 if you can find an economically viable way to do it, go for it! Clearly no one has found a way to do that with EVs. or plastics. or rubber. or countless personal items you'd find in a drug store. until that happens, which prob won't be in the next couple of decades, we need oil.
928 2018-11-25 22:41:20 God same! But I put coconut oil that helps and there’s this dove anti-dandruff shampoo I’ve been using and everyone needs it
929 2018-11-25 22:41:12 I don't think I know enough about forecasting oil supply to be able to give you a good answer. One thing that I like to do when commodity prices get depressed is to find companies that have been over punished because of it and buy their debt and sometimes their equity.
930 2018-11-25 22:41:05 But the stock market is falling too.  So what I haven't spent in oil, I've lost in worth. Plus, I think speculation on the oil market has more to do with pricing than anything else.
931 2018-11-25 22:40:55 Peppermint oil and tea tree oil is my go to. Both are good for your scalp. Which works for me especially in colder months.
932 2018-11-25 22:40:42 woke up to Dom spilling this baby oil every fucking where.. 
933 2018-11-25 22:40:29 I recommend y'all watch Patriot Act hosted by Hasan Minhaj! it's a weekly show about america's politics and culture as told from a comedic standpoint. there's episodes varying from big oil to the brand Supreme to this weeks episode on immigration. go!
934 2018-11-25 22:40:29 Need to get an oil change in the morning
935 2018-11-25 22:40:22 おにーさんにまかせとけー！
936 2018-11-25 22:40:22 Sis! Drink hot oil
937 2018-11-25 22:40:15 I use castor oil !!
938 2018-11-25 22:40:14 The cannabis factor can't be overestimated here. I'm told that half of the massive legal west coast marijuana market is prefilled hash oil cartridges, or disposable oil pens. These are visually identical to e-cigarette products, and most user terminology is the same.
939 2018-11-25 22:40:06 To add oil to a dish already cooking, add it in the edge of the pan. That way, it will be heated when it reaches your food. #VAfitness
940 2018-11-25 22:40:05 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
941 2018-11-25 22:39:57 Inflation DOUBLED in 2016,+'17. Up 30% this year!! Your sanctions on Iran+anti-climate change/pollutiing de-reg has driven oil prices to 3 yr highs.Stock market lost ALL gains for year+Trade Wars are destroying markets we'll never get back! What are you talking about?
942 2018-11-25 22:39:54 Hard to disagree, that 17 DOES mean a LOT.
Perhaps we could include the 17 into the design of the car wrap, but still give Scotty the privilege of wearing his hard-earned # 1 with pride as well .. And Shell could play their part by calling their Aussie oil ..
“Old # 17” 
943 2018-11-25 22:39:53 Doug Ford and Friends force OPEC and others to drop oil price for world-wide gas price drop. Even Trump gives Doug big tweet praise.
944 2018-11-25 22:39:46 Tyler, Taylor, Taft or Truman? I don’t how any of those Presidents could have had anything to do with today’s oil prices. Guess I’ll have to ask Frederick Douglass...
945 2018-11-25 22:39:46 Looking for feedback on the best CBD oil for chronic pain and anxiety relief. There are so many choices. Anyone have a feedback on a product that they know works?
946 2018-11-25 22:39:43 Also the price of oil has FALLEN to $50 bbl.
947 2018-11-25 22:39:37 Anyone who believes this garbage would have also bought snake oil : (
948 2018-11-25 22:39:10 Really ... I thought thanks to the federal and provincial gov’t who’ve been in power for a bit, Calgary was a wasteland of fractured oil industry dream and abandoned pick up trucks
949 2018-11-25 22:39:09 Motor oil will soak into pancakes
950 2018-11-25 22:39:05 his captions send me sis  abo “ your minister of oil’s penthouse “
951 2018-11-25 22:38:56 Yeah, we tried lane oil like from a bowling alley, I have had it on for like 8 years so I'm not surprised it didnt come off lmfaoo it was my favorite one though:(
952 2018-11-25 22:38:54 Thank you Ontario for scrapping cap n trade to reduce gas prices.  BC has experienced a drop of almost 30cents a litre that I'm sure had nothing to do with the global price of oil.  /s
953 2018-11-25 22:38:51 日常（1人暮らし）に戻りました。快調です！おはようございます。
954 2018-11-25 22:38:50 I wonder who contributes to his campaigns ? Let me take a guess big oil and gas companies. I see a conflict of interest big time.
955 2018-11-25 22:38:48 No it is not a conspiracy theory.  I know an oil company that held their tankers out until prices were raised in the 80s
956 2018-11-25 22:38:48 liiiiiiike........ motor oil as pancake syrup? yikes. i mean i get the point, but still lol
957 2018-11-25 22:38:47 you got your oil changed biff???! I’m so proud of you
958 2018-11-25 22:38:31 ur an idiot... truly.. oil prices drop means loss of jobs and income to american oil companies who are fracking and exlporing for new oil sources...but, of course u dont care about them, u only care about making joe public BELIEVE things are better for them.
959 2018-11-25 22:38:26 That’s Motor Oil????!!
960 2018-11-25 22:38:25 -Keep the heat don’t on styling tools
-Wash hair less often
-But when you DO wash your hair, finish off with a deep-conditioning treatment.
-Create your own DIY coconut oil hair mask for some seriously soft hair.
961 2018-11-25 22:38:16 So last year I found out cars need oil changes... well a YEAR later here I am getting my second one ever LOL
962 2018-11-25 22:38:15 Exactly my guy ur head get oil
963 2018-11-25 22:38:14 @RickSantorum It's about money, for sure, but it's about making boatloads of money for big oil, coal, and all the other polluters.  You have to be totally brain dead not to see that.  @CNN, stop putting this shill on camera.
964 2018-11-25 22:38:12 So you admit we reduced CO2 more than any other country but to minimize by using %. And even if Trump wants more coal and oil, natural gas is cheaper although and is reason for decline.
965 2018-11-25 22:38:11 Im tryna find something coconut oil don’t work don’t work for me
966 2018-11-25 22:38:01 I think they might have a mitigation plan that does not involve actually burning fossil fuels. Like, pouring oil instead of milk in the cereal of school children while claiming they support free breakfast programs?
967 2018-11-25 22:37:56 Yes, Mexico does my point was oil isn't involved with Mexico unlike the middle east.
968 2018-11-25 22:37:52 Just having a mental breakdown because I’m out of canola oil and forgot to get some at the store just now. Normal
969 2018-11-25 22:37:48 pure ass oil on this man
970 2018-11-25 22:37:44 Grim reality is that if we currently cant get our oil to market , we wont have any economy left for Grampa & the kids  . & BTW  Canada's reduced dependency on oil wont change the global outlook one bit , get China & India on board then there is a chance
971 2018-11-25 22:37:42 Also no thanks to Canada, the main supplier of oil to US. Lol
972 2018-11-25 22:37:35 T-Schittly...
Prices are lower because there is a glut of oil.
973 2018-11-25 22:37:33 What do you use on your hair? I use tea tree oil & coconut oil on my scalp/hair for hair growth & to deal with scalp itch.
974 2018-11-25 22:37:30 @realDonaldTrump Please be careful with closing border crossings. You could end up crippling US manufacturing but disrupting the supply chain.  I know at my plan we await daily shipments from her sister plants in Mexico. Not something to play around with just like the oil prices
975 2018-11-25 22:37:23 17:34:HAZMAT INCIDENT BOSTON, MA -600 WASHINGTON ST -U/D CAR 3 HAS 150 GAL OF HOME HEATING OIL LEAKED INTO THE BASEMENT NOW REQUEST A LEVEL 2 RESPONCE  NEFN46
976 2018-11-25 22:37:22 Or fear of global slowdown in growth could be a reason for lower oil prices. 

How about the federal deficit? Can we also thank ‘President T’ for that, also? #Maga #resist #ImpeachTrump
977 2018-11-25 22:37:20 If you had an electric car, you wouldn't need motor oil anyway, so you might as well pour it on your pancakes.
978 2018-11-25 22:37:17 Sure. But the implication is that there's hypocrisy going on here.

The shots at the Feds aren't that they're allowing global oil prices to decrease, it's that they're failing to expand pipeline capacity.
979 2018-11-25 22:37:15 The Hemp/marijuana plant is the cure. Everyone should be taking CBD oil!  It cured me!!!
980 2018-11-25 22:37:11 snake oil, hopium or bullshit it's all the same garbage!
981 2018-11-25 22:37:06 I might have to if I don’t see an improvement soon.  Honestly though I have never been much of a Carnivore though and I enjoy eating veggies.  I am also severely underweight so I could use the carbs.  I started taking shots of olive oil a few days ago to up my calories too.
982 2018-11-25 22:37:03 So what if we get most of our oil from Canada. Oil producing countries around the globe have an effect on price by production.
983 2018-11-25 22:37:01 all i got on black friday was a oil diffuser and a blanket. #savings
984 2018-11-25 22:36:54 Most ignorant statement ever by Santorum, and that is saying something.
Scientests would make a hell of a lot more money by taking oil company cash for dishonest reports.
985 2018-11-25 22:36:51 I've heard these talking points from the oil and gas industry.
986 2018-11-25 22:36:49 Oh, then it's time for a massive amount of hair products. Gel, spray, oil, the works.

Dares to hover his hand above Hugh's hair. He's ready for another touch.
987 2018-11-25 22:36:34 Sex work is more respectable than cash loan companies, cops, politicians, insurance companies, oil companies, bankers. That’s just a few.
988 2018-11-25 22:36:33 So he's not then? Saying he trusts them? Pretty sure he said that and that seems pretty ass kissing like to me. Instead he should be strict with them and demand the truth and be tough. Not just agree cus they have oil
989 2018-11-25 22:36:30 I need a hot oil treatment
990 2018-11-25 22:36:29 Hahahaa... Presidents can’t control the oil market.  The global economy drives that.  You realize your fake tough talk about Iran is crushing domestic producers ?
991 2018-11-25 22:36:29 Mr President think of other countries that depends on oil as a source of revenue
992 2018-11-25 22:36:16 m8 you don't understand, very important we send troops to the middle east and drone strike them, could just build some nuclear reactors and invest in solar technology to get off oil, but that'd be dumb.
993 2018-11-25 22:36:07 You’ll find that the price you pay at the pump in Not based on cost of Alberta oil but the world price of oil. Just sayin.
994 2018-11-25 22:36:06 They should blames the California communist party of BC (NDP) for blockading their oil.
995 2018-11-25 22:35:35 いちろ~とサマのことについて考え始めるとどんどん深みに嵌っていくので沼から抜け出せないし抜け出す気も無い
996 2018-11-25 22:35:32 So Russia didn’t control the oil.
997 2018-11-25 22:35:21 The ones being driven by money are the politicians who are taking millions from Big Oil and Dirty Coal.
998 2018-11-25 22:35:20 There was no intel? It was pure crap on your president to start a war over oil! Why are you using Saudi oil? It isn’t made in the U.S of A. Fraud!

1001 2018-11-25 22:34:54 Also falling oil prices us a way to punish Russia for their attempts to interfere with our elections and cause chaos in the US. Their economy depends on oil sales and lower prices on international market hurts their ability to oppose us
1002 2018-11-25 22:34:54 Good heavenly days!
You're a Texas news source, and you need the oil and gas industry explained to you?
#GetInformed
1003 2018-11-25 22:34:51 World-wide gas prices drop as Doug Ford and Friends force OPEC and others to drop oil prices. Way to go Doug!

1006 2018-11-25 22:34:43 I mean. It's just carbs baked in oil. WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?
1007 2018-11-25 22:34:34 The president has absolutely nothing to do with oil prices or gas prices. There was a beautiful sunrise here in central Texas today, are you going to take credit for that? How about the Brexit deal? The only thing you can take credit for is your golf game.
1008 2018-11-25 22:34:14 or really any leaked stream, i remember that guy who streamed sonic mania early and he gameovered like 12 times on oil ocean
1009 2018-11-25 22:34:13 You can get CBD oil in Eastworks, no?

1011 2018-11-25 22:34:01 Notable since Cruz really tried to make the "Beto voted to put a 10% tax on oil" attack stick. (In reality all he did was vote against stripping regulatory agencies of the power to impose environmental fees on oil).
1012 2018-11-25 22:33:36 I put them on smoker at 275 if using electric or 300 if using charcoal. Also, that set up you just mentioned is great as well. Olive oil is a must use on chicken.
1013 2018-11-25 22:33:27 By "hurt the economy", Lee/Trmp/GOP are talking about some of the FOSSIL FUEL production based part of the economy (ONLY).  
In other words, could hurt campaign contributing Oil Co. profits -- HEAVEN FORBID!
1014 2018-11-25 22:33:23 すっっっっげえ
1015 2018-11-25 22:33:16 The attacks on renewable energy I’ve seen lately in some environmental circles that make no sense if you actually know about the advancements in their development the past few decades obviously has oil, coal, etc funding,
1016 2018-11-25 22:33:08 the saudis and oil companies were considered evil by Tesla fans until they thought they would bail out Tesla. How did that work out? VW bailing out Tesla... same story...... did not happen.
1017 2018-11-25 22:33:06 I want to be the kind of person who has an oil painting of themselves up over their mantel
1018 2018-11-25 22:32:59 Provincial Conservative AB govts squandered unimaginable oil royalties for decades.  #unlikeNorway
1019 2018-11-25 22:32:58 Great cabinet undeŕ a corrupt leadership, your perfect cabinet could not leave $200b in 5yrs but Algeria that sold less oil than ur cabinet saved $194b by the end of 2014, that one na cabinet?
Worse still, littered the nation with abandoned projects, waiting 4 Buhari mtchew!!
1020 2018-11-25 22:32:48 @jasonbenetti is a national treasure.  Listening to him call Steelers Broncos game on radio.  Something about a guy having an oil stain on him after he got run over on that last TD. Amazing
1021 2018-11-25 22:32:37 Mmmm...pancakes and motor oil. Coats your tummy & your innards slide out effortlessly. YAY...10W30 enema! 
1022 2018-11-25 22:32:35 Today Russia  act is just make oil price up
1023 2018-11-25 22:32:29 The tip-off is that oil company execs are so poor and climate scientists so filthy rich.
1024 2018-11-25 22:32:07 Need really big deval of real money (oil) against gold or some other neutral reserve asset.  That would likely work.  Fail that, & things may get quite hairy.
1025 2018-11-25 22:32:06 Gasoline and heating oil should be much lower giving the dramatic fall in crude oil prices. Americans are being gouged by the oil Companies. New England is being screwed. Investigate pricing mechanism!  MAGA!
1026 2018-11-25 22:32:03 Yeah eh. My church has dim lighting because oil lamps arent that bright.

1028 2018-11-25 22:31:51 Is this all because Russia needs control of that strait to get their oil out ?
1029 2018-11-25 22:31:48 Oil's gross
1030 2018-11-25 22:31:44 And Republicans funded by the oil industry are..?
1031 2018-11-25 22:31:37 Big oil fucked WV during the heyday of coal and doing it again ... WV needs to wake up!
1032 2018-11-25 22:31:36 Should cover those with oil, like Pam.
1033 2018-11-25 22:31:35 Ya bir passiflora ya da lavender oil lazım acil uyku tutmuyor
1034 2018-11-25 22:31:16 1. A president doesn't increase or decrease gas prices. 

2. A temporary surplus of oil is not like a "big Tax Cut."

3. Deflation isn't always a good thing. For reasons you haven't a clue.
1035 2018-11-25 22:31:14 Bought a $7 plate of chicken wings and fries, this was the worse purchase I've ever made. The fries were too soggy with oil and tasted plain since the cook didn't add salt. The wings were probably fried in an oil that's been used over and over again ! I should file a complaint 
1036 2018-11-25 22:31:11 What “money they receive?” Grant money to conduct studies? They don’t buy homes in Aspen with that money unlike the @Gop members who are in the oil lobby’s pocket. It doesn’t work the same way. Ignoramus.
1037 2018-11-25 22:31:08 Trump is like an old timey snake oil salesman, but disguised as the snake. His supporters buy every bit of shit he is selling.
1038 2018-11-25 22:31:00 the recipe for a relaxing room: clean sheets/blankets sprinkled with lavender oil, a himalayan salt rock lamp, jasmine incense burning, an essential oil diffuser with vanilla, cinnamon, and orange oil in it, & alina baraz for the music. a vibe
1039 2018-11-25 22:31:00 Right, oil prices are down. But still you are friends with a murderer
1040 2018-11-25 22:30:53 I need an oil change
1041 2018-11-25 22:30:49 Trump cited oil and arms sale.  Neither have a huge impact on the US.  13% of imported oil is from SA.  Trumps 450B figure for the arms sale is false.  SA has committed to 14.5B but that’s just a commitment. No contracts yet.
Lie. After. Lie.  What lie is too much, too costly?
1042 2018-11-25 22:30:46 We JUST drove by there to look at CBD oil for the dog, saw the line, and turned right around.
1043 2018-11-25 22:30:45 WADDA SCHMUCK, Dept. @realDonaldTrump has NO CLUE about how gasoline prices are constructed.  Canadian and US suppliers lowered crude oil prices, Donnie. NOT YOU.  SCHMUCK @POTUS DOLT45/

1049 2018-11-25 22:30:25 I seriously believe we will have to transfer the oil revenues progressively over several years as England’s economy would collapse if it transferred immediately on independence. And having a bankrupt neighbour is no help to anybody.
1050 2018-11-25 22:30:25 I'm going for essentials such as olive oil and tinned tomatoes
1051 2018-11-25 22:30:22 It’s on Whale Oil.
1052 2018-11-25 22:30:16 For starters, check to see how often high-ranking Saudi’s stayed at the Trump Hotel in D.C. The country has been producing more oil & gas, so avoiding Saudi-directed price gouging is unlikely to be the reason. Maybe money has been laundered or there are undisclosed private deals.
1053 2018-11-25 22:30:14 This is the first thing that I totally disagree with you on, Mr. President. Low oil prices are good only to a certain point and we’re getting close to that point. Tens of thousands of blue collar workers depend on a healthy oil industry. Like miners, they voted for you.
1054 2018-11-25 22:30:05 The clean-up costs for Alberta oil infrastructure (inactive wells and tailings ponds etc) is pegged at 260B. We should stop subsidizing them and instead sue for negligence and clean up costs.
1055 2018-11-25 22:29:59 When oil down it understand as market has liquidity crunch and tech stock down as the first symbol that market on his last leg
1056 2018-11-25 22:29:42 Read: We're lying about the deficit and saying wynne did part of our spending, and also DON'T LOOK AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE GOING UP WHATEVER YOU DO!

RED TAPE! RED TAPE! BUY MY SNAKE OIL!
1057 2018-11-25 22:29:41 Looks great, what temp and wood you usually smoke them at/with? All summer long I used olive oil and Gates seasoning - smoked for little less than 2 hours at 225 then threw them in the oven for 10-15 min to tighten the skin/make sure internal temp is 165.
1058 2018-11-25 22:29:41 Canny wait to wake up and scran pancakes and engine oil
1059 2018-11-25 22:29:36 Some people on my Facebook where making jokes about how essential oils don't really work and that's totally untrue. I take lavendar oil pills and they help me so much!!
1060 2018-11-25 22:29:33 Probably not the case, Fracking and horizontal drilling is what's keeping the price of oil down and as slowing demand globally.
1061 2018-11-25 22:29:29 Ehmm can I ask ??
What is anointing oil made of ?
1062 2018-11-25 22:29:10 Georgia Sunrise - Uplifting 5 fold orange essential oil and White Butterfly Ginger tinged with a single drop of aged white patchouli.

Sounds nice?
1063 2018-11-25 22:29:04 Sure, ONE of the reasons is your scrapping the cap & trade agreement (it's also part of your 15 billion deficit). However, around 90% of the drop is the tanking oil prices that are destroying alberta.

Also, when the prices go up, blame you, is what you're saying.
1064 2018-11-25 22:29:02 Have a smoke to finish it off.
1065 2018-11-25 22:28:57 I think the oil industry could do a lot more too. They should be consulting with First Nations as much as the Feds and NEB. First Nations could be directly involved with the process both from an economic and environmental standpoint
1066 2018-11-25 22:28:56 That’s quite the fetish they have there. Do you suppose they went home, took off all their clothes and then rummaged in each other’s asses for that sweet, sweet shit scent all night? Maybe some baby oil was introduced into the festivities? What would this fetish be called?
1067 2018-11-25 22:28:55 Vacuum up a piece of cotton with essential oils on it (maybe orange, peppermint & cinnamon this time of year) and it will spread great smell across house. But be sure to use real (pure) essential oil (not from drug store) as fragrance oils can give you a headache.
1068 2018-11-25 22:28:49 Honeslty I turned it off when they poured oil on it  can't wait to watch them destroy a pie 
1069 2018-11-25 22:28:49 Well, I was going to clean my floors, including oil soaping the wood floors & de-greasing my living room carpet from J's BK shoes.

1071 2018-11-25 22:28:43 Well said. God bless you dude for sharing this. I’ll def retweet. Even in India, it’s still a Nigerian who will perform the surgery
1072 2018-11-25 22:28:38 He's playing through a lot of pain, according to the CBS broadcast (not sure if you are at Lucas Oil or watching from home)
1073 2018-11-25 22:28:35 I use ⅓ butter to ⅔ oil. Works great. Once it starts to brown you have to watch it like a hawk but we’re talking only a few minutes
1074 2018-11-25 22:28:35 Also when we say "rural", we meant it. Even areas like Jefferson and Orange counties (where I grew up in Southeast Texas) went for Beto. These are blue-collar oil refinery towns.
1075 2018-11-25 22:28:34 How. They traded in petrodollars for oil purchases. That alone is way more the world could ever pay to US for its war crimes.
1076 2018-11-25 22:28:29 The international Oil Industry and our dependence on it has caused more worldwide havoc and suffering than any plague, famine, or natural disaster. It has caused wars, poisoned our waters, dirtied our air, lifted evil men into power, and stolen wealth from working people.

1084 2018-11-25 22:27:19 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
1085 2018-11-25 22:27:18 We were warned for decades that we shouldn't expand production in the oil sands without increasing our domestic upgrading capacity. If we had built more cokers we would be able to sell to anyone in the world. But we didn't so we can only sell to people with cokers.
1086 2018-11-25 22:27:12 The American Dollar is backed by Saudi Oil is no longer on the gold standard in addition allowing an American to be murdered, this is your type of DEAL MAKING..  How much would you throw the rest of #MAGA under the bus to make $$$$ #Impeach45 #MARINESagainstTrump

1092 2018-11-25 22:27:02 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's #oil.
1093 2018-11-25 22:26:59 1. Shut up.
2. You have nothing to do with the price of oil.
3. We certainly need the Fed to cool the pace of their tightening, but you SAYING what they should do makes them more likely to resist so they don’t look political. 
4. ..Shut up.
1094 2018-11-25 22:26:48 Government and Corporate interest backing each other.

Now, where do scientists fit in? You think you get grant money saying "everything is fine" or "We are all going to die"?

Depends on how much money it can make for a political donor if it is a government grant.
1095 2018-11-25 22:26:47 Also a coastal nation has control of all economic resources within its exclusive economic zone, which extends to a maximum of 200 nautical miles,  including fishing, mining, oil exploration, and any pollution of those resources.Overlap of the zones seems likely between EU and UK.
1096 2018-11-25 22:26:45 My dad, who has boycotted Exxon since the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, just stopped at an Exxon just to go to the restroom. "Now it's MY turn to make a toxic dump"
1097 2018-11-25 22:26:44 @AhhleeR2 the president controls oil prices right
1098 2018-11-25 22:26:42 fkn cookin oil??? lmao
1099 2018-11-25 22:26:39 Erm... white phosphorus is stored under water; alkali metals (e.g. Sodium, potassium) are stored under oil.

White phosphorus will be oil soluble to a reasonable extent, so storing that way would be ... unwise.
1100 2018-11-25 22:26:27 I can fully understand the @OntarioPCParty trying to take credit for something they once again had no part of, since what they have done has been a disaster for Ontario. So should Alberta then blame  Doug for the drop in oil prices that is effecting their oil industry?
1101 2018-11-25 22:26:23 Sounds like the fans have returned to Lucas Oil..crowd is very loud today
1102 2018-11-25 22:26:19 I use canola oil, put it on qtip and rub along eyelash line

1105 2018-11-25 22:26:05 In 20 years time, only the old folks will think a noisy, polluting, oil leaking, internal combustion engine is cool. The world would have moved forward to clean, cheap, environmental friendly renewable sources. #fairdinkumpower #renewables #auspol #climatechange #generationequity
1106 2018-11-25 22:26:02 Calm down, sleep will do just that soon.
1107 2018-11-25 22:26:00 Take for example a few days ago when he spoke about Saudi Arabia. We don’t get a majority of our oil from them. Only 11% and he incorrectly doubled the amount of jobs he reported were due to their buying of airplanes. Google Trump and fact checking.
1108 2018-11-25 22:25:53 I’ve seen that goddamn food photography hack video at least 5 times on all social media feeds today and I would still take a bite out of those motor oil pancakes bc they look bangin’
1109 2018-11-25 22:25:50 I gotta get a oil change toma

1111 2018-11-25 22:25:33 Global oil prices are down about 34% in the last 8 weeks. I'd give credit to the global oil producers for that.
1112 2018-11-25 22:25:27 Certainly huge coal use as a driver of development in many poorer nations needs urgently to be addressed - potentially with some financial reparation from history’s high-emitters. But the West’s addiction to oil & gas must not be allowed to hide behind a veil of ‘evil coal’.
1113 2018-11-25 22:25:26 Life tip:

Grill your tortellini, don’t boil it. On a pan with more olive oil than water, like a potsticker, or gyoza. Makes them nice and crispy and brings out the flavour of the cheese.
1114 2018-11-25 22:25:17 Pile......?? Where's that come from? I meant oil @anneapplebaum lol
1115 2018-11-25 22:25:07 Absolutely. Its all part of the plan. They were selling our country for the gas pipeline from Iran to Turkey thru to Europe. NATO took Libya and took all the countries wealth and now all those people are fleeing to our countries. They want the oil!
1116 2018-11-25 22:24:56 That's why I tuned it out.  Oil, coal, and defense contractors control the agenda by their advertising.  Shame on NBC.

1120 2018-11-25 22:24:20 You can't make coal, oil, natural gas, steel, concrete, and meat drastically more expensive without wrecking the economy.  Problem is, not doing it will be far worse.
1121 2018-11-25 22:24:18 No worries. Oil will still collapse.  I know this because I am long oil!
1122 2018-11-25 22:24:16 Wow @realDonaldTrump so amazing! Today you brag & take credit for lower gas prices which you have nothing to do with. BTW anyone let you know USA is largest oil producer in world & has been a long time progress? You were taking credit for stock market, how you doing with it?
1123 2018-11-25 22:24:12 You using motor oil?
1124 2018-11-25 22:24:10 Just checkin his oil

i hate the name OLAY
we had oil of ulan ... that was mysterious
1127 2018-11-25 22:24:03 you mean theyve been looting our oil for decades, and they want to dictate how to bring up our kids ? shame on Muslim puppet dictators who run our countries for the benefit of these western islamophobic regimes, and cannot even question them or embargo them !
1128 2018-11-25 22:24:00 Peak oil leads to peak water from peak population 

If you can’t find a way to set up a regenerative circular economy permaculture with aquaponic bio char green energy conversion you are doomed without agreements with nature
1129 2018-11-25 22:23:56 I would agree; except that 6 major oil companies have also come out to say that it's a truth. So; oddly, both the scientists and the oil barons are in agreement.
1130 2018-11-25 22:23:54 Brian Topp the anti oil former chief of staff for Notley in this special envoy? Makes perfect sense.

1134 2018-11-25 22:23:37 I like Russia and its people but I cannot agree with you over Putin. Putin is no more than a gangster, who runs a kleptocracy, He managed to build up his forces through high oil prices, nothing to do with him. He sends hit squads around the world to kill anyone who opposes him.
1135 2018-11-25 22:23:32 Mobile Rangers can do 80% maintenance

No oil changes
No tune ups
No smog checks
No timing belt
No transmission (drive unit has reduction gear, no shifting)
Brakes last longer (re-gen)

Charging at home much easier than going to refuel
OTA Updates means cars get better over time
1136 2018-11-25 22:23:24 I only like coconut if it’s in my suntanning oil/lotion but I don’t like actually eating it lol but I have found a lot of people do like eating especially in cake. I think it ruins it haha
1137 2018-11-25 22:23:21 They specifically said that if EE was completed they wouldn't change their product mix. 
Our bitumen is expensive to refine because it only has 75% of the hydrogen found in higher quality oil. That missing 25% is filled in with heavy metals, toxic and radioactive substances.
1138 2018-11-25 22:23:19 Just got a nice castor oil head massage from my dad 
1139 2018-11-25 22:23:14 We were also be writing messages on the ornaments with an oil based sharpie. Obviously my mom will be doing that part LOL.
1140 2018-11-25 22:23:11 Player has to play: he’s had low TOI, was amongst Oilers lowest utilized PP forwards throughout ELC. Part of it’s not trusting player, coaching not to be fired, but a huge part falls upon coach/GM. Yes, player needs to grasp opportunity, but what do you do when no TOI is given?

1142 2018-11-25 22:22:56 The price of oil (driving this gas price reduction) is not related to @fordnation action, and we should not celebrate saving a few cents today at the expense we of our planet's future.
1143 2018-11-25 22:22:53 I use CBD oil in a lotion type form and it helps wonderfully with headaches and cramps and other types of physical pain as well!! Good luck!
1144 2018-11-25 22:22:51 Yes America is the top producer under Donald Trump yes yes my president but Venezuela is the largest national reserve look under BP SR** under socialism rule they can’t get it out of the ground they found a large deposit of sand oil to boot isn’t this sad setting on all that oil
1145 2018-11-25 22:22:47 Russia's invasion of Crimea was driven by natural gas exports, right? Now oil  has dropped off a cliff? Maybe this is just a maneuver to drive up prices?
1146 2018-11-25 22:22:46 Thanks man! Yeah it's a good thing I can cheer for the oil down here still, plus there's a couple pubs about that show the games so it's not too shabby of an arrangement
1147 2018-11-25 22:22:44 Given only 20 or so on the right disagree with May enough to write a no confidence letter I wonder whether she might crumple and buy the SNP votes. Perhaps devolving fishing, immigration, oil and corporation tax might work.
1148 2018-11-25 22:22:41 Saudi Arabia is the one of the most evil allies America ever. And it must be clear, Republicans/Democrats have equally supported this. It is unclear to me if there is really any purpose for it. Surely, it no longer is necessary for Israel's or our oil needs.
1149 2018-11-25 22:22:37 GE and Sylvania has a duopoly on CFLs. They require huge startups to get into that industry to have the machinery to form the glass, coat the glass with phosphorous, fill it with noble gas, seal it.

That's a crap ton of investment to nearly go down the drain with LEDs inbound.
1150 2018-11-25 22:22:26 A weekly olive oil hair mask, olive oil leave in conditioner. So basically products containing olive oil. [laughing as I shake your hand then bring you in for a hug] Congratulations on making an honest man out of Chez. It's about time someone does.
1151 2018-11-25 22:22:20 Need help! We’re having a tea tree oil emergency!!! Can anyone bring us some? I am quarantined to my house now because it turns out that we have yet another lice outbreak and this time it’s on MY head.

1155 2018-11-25 22:22:08 BITCH! I deleted the thread where i was crying over an oil change i need
1156 2018-11-25 22:22:02 There's a popular saying in Kano, 'siyasar kano sai kano' Kano's politics is exclusive to Kano.
Just watch out.
1157 2018-11-25 22:22:01 Cancer, heart disease, suicide.... All hoaxes being paid for by oil companies to keep climate change off the radar.
1158 2018-11-25 22:22:01 the Chinese han kuffar have no right to terrorise the Uygher Muslims. The puppet arab dictators could easily cut off the oil and put embargo on chinese goods, the Muslims have a right to self defense, independent muslim state is the only solution
1159 2018-11-25 22:22:00 LNP in denial and refuse to see what we all do.  Voters are tired of right wing governments that spread fear and protect big business like banks and oil companies.  They want governments to govern for the people and they want renewable energy!
1160 2018-11-25 22:21:54 If countries fear a big conflict is coming they will start buying and hoarding oil,  mob or no mob, thus driving up the price. Putin needs a higher price to fund his ops.
1161 2018-11-25 22:21:50 Malan Allah ya tsare, wannan kam ganganci ne
1162 2018-11-25 22:21:49 @20committee is right. The Sea of Azov is strategically useless. Don't take my word for it, go look. I say we keep driving down the price of oil, hitting Moscow where it hurts.
1163 2018-11-25 22:21:46 you mean like the oil industry?
1164 2018-11-25 22:21:40 This is what the Prime Minister does best,... photo ops!  Meanwhile he cuddles up to Petro-fuel companies, mostly non-Canadian companies and when we should be fighting Global Warming, he promotes the Tar Sands: the dirtiest oil in the world.

1166 2018-11-25 22:21:31 Agree with you Andrea. I had a small environmental consulting company back in my PhD years, and even one small consulting job for the oil industry is easily more $$ than 1-year postdoc salary. We're not in it for the money. We're in it because it's the right thing to do
1167 2018-11-25 22:21:20 The writings on the wall for the west: SEPARATE! He hates Oil BUT he hates the West more! He had a good teacher.
1168 2018-11-25 22:21:18 his move to ukrain in '14 was blocked when the USA sold 3 months worth of world consumption of oil halving its price, and resulting a gross de facto loss for russian et putin's personal assets.

Since 1914 oil is the key of every conflicts.
1169 2018-11-25 22:21:07 Yep and they passed a treaty and banned the chemicals and the ozone layer is recovering. What we would be doing with climate change if it weren’t for oil industry funded lobbying and lies.
1170 2018-11-25 22:21:02 If there are any "scientists" driven by money, it's the ones shilling for Big Oil and Big Agri.
1171 2018-11-25 22:20:51 Gas prices are down all over the world as a result of oil prices dropping.  Please don't take credit for this. SMH
1172 2018-11-25 22:20:44 afterward. the coconut oil should provide a protective coating over the tooth, as long as u don't remove it by eating or drinking/applying toothache relievers.

1175 2018-11-25 22:20:22 There are alternative oils, so hopefully your fav products make the change. Lose the palm oil market and educate the people on alternative farming that does not destroy the environment. .  
Thank you, Mona!
1176 2018-11-25 22:20:17 While lifting weights, Butch Otter patiently explains to Rick Perry that ISIS soldiers are sitting on vast reserves of oil. George Will creates an international incident.
1177 2018-11-25 22:20:16 Oil prices fell because Saudi Arabia increased production as one of the bones it threw you in exchange for your pass on state sponsored murder.  Overall, rapidly falling oil prices signal huge economic problems on horizon due to your tariffs and deficit spending.
1178 2018-11-25 22:20:14 Before Obama, USA was instrumental in controlling oil prices.
1179 2018-11-25 22:20:07 For me it was the motor oil!
1180 2018-11-25 22:20:05 Do these guys really think we buy this sort of stuff. Who gets massive money from Oil Gas Arms dealers then. NRA OUT.
1181 2018-11-25 22:20:05 Ignore the plastics. Without oil money they'd be non-league.
1182 2018-11-25 22:20:00 A oil prices are falling. Add is a Tax Cut and Jobs Act, to our Economic union. Inflation down! FOOL, Mr.President @realDonaldTrump!

1189 2018-11-25 22:19:35 Heading over to France to visit one of our manufacturers.   Our oil and gas manufacturers are a vital part of our industry and I enjoy talking with the employees that work hard and take pride in make quality equipment that we need to be reliable in our well bores.
1190 2018-11-25 22:19:25 long hair is a constant battle between shampoo, conditioner, and coconut oil.
1191 2018-11-25 22:19:23 If they had oil that wouldn't seem to be an issue. You're right though, it's time everyone stopped relying on the US for leadership and some kind of moral authority. They don't have either.
1192 2018-11-25 22:19:16 Hey Mr President how about passing some of those low oil prices on to the regular folk? Gas is higher today than when you took office, oh yea, good job on those interest rates too..my house is now worth less than when u took office
1193 2018-11-25 22:19:07 No the reason gas prices are low is because oil is selling at 50$ a barrel, LIAR
1194 2018-11-25 22:19:04 That happened just before LEDs got competitive. Which are WAY more efficient. Far longer lasting, have accurate color reproduction and current Gen have no flicker.

They are cheaper than CFLs and superior to incandescent.
1195 2018-11-25 22:19:02 Oh shut up. Just because you couldn't get the oil cap back on, now we can't wait until we get a new car... 
1196 2018-11-25 22:18:58 That was my point. He did not ban oil export to control oil prices, he did because everything in his economy was bust. So USA had left Saudi & Russia to control prices - which was my first point

1199 2018-11-25 22:18:55 In fact, lyin' Donnie, neither you OR S.A. had anything to do with falling oil prices.  You overheated the economy with your bullshit tax cut, & interest rates went up.  They are projected to CONTINUE going up.  Your trade war has destroyed the stock market; losing policies.
1200 2018-11-25 22:18:42 I wonder if they've checked with NASA, UC-San Diego and/or Northumbria Univ in the UK about the Grand Solar Minimum in a couple of decades that historically has led to a mini-ice age?
1201 2018-11-25 22:18:39 what about oil pulling 

but cum
1202 2018-11-25 22:18:37 My husband is a climate scientist who could make SUBSTANTIALLY MORE MONEY going to work for an oil company.
1203 2018-11-25 22:18:05 @realDonaldTrump if only Honduras has oil. gold, rubber or resources that we need then we can make up a story to invade them like Vietnam and Iraq.
1204 2018-11-25 22:18:05 For me — Puljujarvi needed more time. There’s a player here, and as we talked a few wks ago, we both believe there’s a player here, but ceiling/expectation should be lowered a bit. Consistent 20G guy, might be able to have 1-3 30G years. I’d love to see him in Top 6 w/ PP time
1205 2018-11-25 22:17:58 I do, and oil/coal companies will be paying for research if they can skew the data in their favour
1206 2018-11-25 22:17:57 Remember the incandescent ban? When people were forced to buy those stupid CFLs no one wanted in the name of Climate Change?

Poor lifespan, full of toxic chems, not that much more efficient, bad color reproduction, and flickering?
1207 2018-11-25 22:17:46 If your drains are running slow, or smell, put 1 cup baking soda & 1 cup vinegar in drain, after it stops bubbling pour a kettle full of boiling water. Also Murphy's Oil soap is terrific for cleaning. All the above are good for Mama Earth. 
1208 2018-11-25 22:17:45 Love them roasted with olive oil, garlic & potatoes! Enjoy. 
1209 2018-11-25 22:17:34 Happiness is a fresh oil change.
1210 2018-11-25 22:17:34 Does your mam put the oil in too?
1211 2018-11-25 22:17:34 I agree that home prices in the Bay Area are insane- but I feel people from out of state who talk up the cheap home prices in the midwest never mention the hidden costs, like heating oil and what road salt does to cars
1212 2018-11-25 22:17:32 The economy of high price fire fighters, rebuilding communities, what about when oil refineries are flooded out and the East coast of US goes swampy? Think that might have some economic impact? If Todd can't counter the ignorance then he needs to invite a scientist.

You'll see them saying the kids dad is dead they hv no food etc
1215 2018-11-25 22:17:21 Mining for a gas tank, radiator, transmission, exhaust pipes and muffler, and for oil then refining it is completely a pollution-free process?

when we are no longer dependent on foreign oil….
1217 2018-11-25 22:17:07 The Republicans that literally survive off their lobby donations claim scientists are driven by money...all while they collect hundreds of thousands from oil and automotive lobbies.
1218 2018-11-25 22:17:03 Damn, that's good tanning solution if you can fool people.

From the picture,  it looks like he bathes in engine oil.
1219 2018-11-25 22:17:01 BS.... you mean the oil companies and pharmaceutical that backing republicans politicians to meet their agenda right??
1220 2018-11-25 22:16:59 Most of the weekend’s #climatechange talk from Twitter has about the POS climate deniers that get airtime. But sadly the windshield bias is clearly embedded. The media is just as addicted to car dependence as regular Americans. Most of the grievance goes against oil companies.
1221 2018-11-25 22:16:56 I'm guessing that is because of the current oil price plunge?
1222 2018-11-25 22:16:49 Let’s just keep using oil based products, keep on with the plastic pollution, keep on burning fossil fuels cause it easy... like @JoinUsCarrots said... nice forward thinking.

1225 2018-11-25 22:16:05 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
1226 2018-11-25 22:16:04 People will realize that they're paying 25% more for heating oil this winter than last. That container of OJ now has 52oz. A can of tuna looks like 7oz but now has 5oz. Inflation is HERE but the gov hasn't made a big deal of it yet. And tax time is soon-people will not see a cut
1227 2018-11-25 22:16:01 it can usually be found near the vitamins and supplements. make sure it is pure coconut oil, and has no other ingredients. floss, and brush ur teeth as best as u can. rinse with water,as i'm sure u usually do. make sure ur mouth isn't overly moist, then rinse with the coconut oil
1228 2018-11-25 22:15:49 @Oshey look at why Nigerians have more confidence in seeking medical tourism than patronize our highly fucked up system. What I was trying to prove yesterday.
1229 2018-11-25 22:15:44 The costs aren't simply monetary. The health or workers, communities at the mining sites and burn sites. Along with coal ash left from energy harvest. Politically it's a minefield. Some of the oldest families/wealth in the US are tied to oil/coal. The environment is suffering.
1230 2018-11-25 22:15:42 I believe that when that was going to be the case that they should’ve stuck him in the AHL. None of us are within Edmonton’s quote/unquote braintrust, but it’s alarming that McLellan/Chiarelli didnt realize the kid needed more development time, instead they let him sit on a bench
1231 2018-11-25 22:15:20 Venezuela, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil all run oil state banana republic economies.   Good luck surviving when oil spills contaminate cattle rancher’s water supplies.
1232 2018-11-25 22:15:08 More projection by the GOP, they feel so guilty about taking money from the oil companies and ignoring climate change that they project their guilt onto others. So sad and so obvious.
1233 2018-11-25 22:15:04 Of course we want Israel to prosper. But author is using sophisticated prose to say: Encourage foolish Shias(Iran) and Sunnis(Saudis) to fight each other to completely annihilate middle east- this guarantees oil and Israel security. Think tanks are criminal.
1234 2018-11-25 22:15:02 I'm from an Alberta oil family, raised Conservative, voted Conservative. "Trudeau" was a swear word. We've all become fans of Justin Trudeau and even (gasp) Rachel Notley. Are they perfect? No. Working more effectively for Alberta than Harper/Kenney? Demonstrably. Absolutely.
1235 2018-11-25 22:15:01 You need too see the Nun, but make sure you keep a Bible and anointing oil by your side, cuz shit could get nasty real quick.
1236 2018-11-25 22:14:48 Fuel prices in UK are too high as oil price currently trading at around $60. Oil companies in UK are plundering the consumers. @GOVUK @10DowningStreet must take measures to protect consumers rights on this issue.
1237 2018-11-25 22:14:42 figured out how to perfect the lucky star bus ride home: 
- cover yourself in lavender oil
- eat a big cookie
- listen to a podcast if the people behind you are not screaming at full volume for hours / blasting music without headphones while not wearing shoes, otherwise punk rock
1238 2018-11-25 22:14:38 The DEVIL IS AFTER YOUR MIND! Pray for the oil..Thou anointed #MYHEAD WITH OIL! Keep my MIND O GOD through this!
1239 2018-11-25 22:14:32 Neptune went direct over the weekend - could mean a possible CIT for oil prices? - whether its that easy Im not sure ?
1240 2018-11-25 22:14:25 If you're  against bailing out business as you say, wouldn't you say same about the dairy & oil companies would you?
1241 2018-11-25 22:14:21 I feel like no matter how much I deep condition, moisturise, seal with oil etc, my hair is just always dry.
1242 2018-11-25 22:14:15 She can’t identify colors yet! She’s great with food though. Like she even surprised me. I was making vinaigrette on Thursday and she stood there going “vinegar... mustard... o-ya (short for cebolla, IE onion)... whisk!... oil” etc. I don’t know where she gets it from ;)

1244 2018-11-25 22:13:58 McLellan was trying to save his job from the start. Even late last season, look at the mins Puljujarvi played even when the team was well outside the playoff picture. McLellan was trying to get as close to playoffs as possible to help his case to keep his job.
1245 2018-11-25 22:13:53 Now talk about the “Donald J. Trump Foundation” you like pretend is a charity but only pays for your personal bs. Like a life size oil painting of yourself. Yet you contribute ZERO to it.

It was a calm day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about Berserkers. 'Use  Cursed Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
1251 2018-11-25 22:13:28 Herbivore Phoenix oil! It’s at Sephora, pricey but literally saved my skin.
1252 2018-11-25 22:13:28 But the oil industry is driven by values, and a deep and genuine concern for the future of mankind.
1253 2018-11-25 22:13:27 That answer is similar to the costs and benefits tied to oil, natural gas exploration, destruction of certain communities and also the overall price control based on global market share. From a consumption point of view China is not taking ad much as it used to. Sure US does uses
1254 2018-11-25 22:13:23 the oil and coal companies in this country are producing the cleanest burning fuel in the world. through their own research and innovation.
1255 2018-11-25 22:12:54 I’m guessing low oil prices are orchestrated by Russian mob?

1260 2018-11-25 22:12:45 44: "We've created 13 million new jobs."
GOP: "How dare he! Private industry creates jobs, not government. THIS SOCIALIST COMMUNIST PRESIDENT DOESN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND CAPITALISM!"
45: "Oil prices falling, thank you President T!"
GOP: Sounds legit. Let us pray for our President."
1261 2018-11-25 22:12:43 Which, lovely man that he is in trying to pour oil on choppy waters, is Joe’s way of saying he agrees with me. xx
1262 2018-11-25 22:12:43 Sure, but doesn’t exactly explain the limited minutes and opportunities Puljujarvi was given throughout his ELC. It was quite clear he wasn’t ready, but I believe McLellan/Chiarelli all have shared blame for his blundered development. Portion of blame goes to player too.
1263 2018-11-25 22:12:35 Does Jamaican black castor oil actually thicken your hair and regrow edges etc? Like has it personally worked for you?
1264 2018-11-25 22:12:35 Okay. I can do that. *I stand back watching, biting my lip when the oil starts to sizzle I place some bacon in the pan*

1267 2018-11-25 22:12:13 I wonder how many years of oil are left at the present rate of consumption ?
1268 2018-11-25 22:12:09 Je crois que vous vous laissez trop faire à Madagascar. Mais je comprends car il y’a tellement d’injustice que les gens ne réagissent plus. Pourtant Madagascar oil produit du pétrole. Ça coûte 0,25 euros en Algérie qui est producteur de pétrole aussi.

1270 2018-11-25 22:11:48 Oil prices rise and fall due to world demand and output quotas , much of the glut is from exploited fields being robbed in foreign lands by western governments. Scotland’s oil will be buoyant in 2019 as the demand increases and OPEC reduce output. Stop putting Scotland down

1274 2018-11-25 22:11:40 Trump delusion:

Thanking himself for low oil prices.

Trump's reality:

Condoning a journalist being assassinated by the Saudi prince for low oil prices.

I'd rather pay more for gas and be proud of my country.

#impeachment
is the only way.

1279 2018-11-25 22:10:34 So Trump standing by them during this PR nightmare, he is using that leverage to get them to increase supply, lowering price and inflation pressure (since oil and $ are connected) in the hopes the Fed wont raise rates that could hurt the economy

1283 2018-11-25 22:10:22 "Should be illegal"...it isn't. 

This is what happens in authoritarian countries. 

We are firing tear gas into a sovereign country, one that we rely on for things like oil. 

These people went to a legal port of entry, only to have Trump cause this.

1288 2018-11-25 22:10:16 does it for us. Hard to say oil companies knew since the beginning of the internal combustion engine this would happen. Oil is what made modern life possible. Including home theater.
1289 2018-11-25 22:10:15 Yes, we all live and die by oil prices which are roughly unchanged in the past few years at the pump.
ACCESSORY TO MURDER remains the issue, Mr. Toast.

1297 2018-11-25 22:09:53 @21215_Alive hey you do oil changes?
1298 2018-11-25 22:09:45 Lol oil has zero to do with Buffoon Trump.
1299 2018-11-25 22:09:44 Huh? Weaker oil = stronger dollar 
1300 2018-11-25 22:09:35 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
1301 2018-11-25 22:09:31 By the way I've understated real multiplier to replace all today's energy with electricity AND bring whole world up to acceptable living standards. It's more like 10 X 90 EJ. Plus it's contingent on a raft of presently unknown technologies for replacing oil & gas in particular 
1302 2018-11-25 22:09:31 Imma ask a local to oil me up in the beach so I can take pictures like that. Mhm
1303 2018-11-25 22:09:20 Interestingly, Trump has been raging on Twitter taking credit for oil price drop etc. We know the link between the Australian LNP and repubs could this be his reaction to drown out the news of the conservative slaughter not to give the US more ideas of decention?

1307 2018-11-25 22:09:07 My mom used to cook old romaine - olive oil, garlic, a splash of chicken broth, and a drizzle of balsamic. It’s weird and delicious. I wonder if it kills E. coli.
1308 2018-11-25 22:09:06 Ans: They are vile because for a start they have cheated Scotland out of her rightful Oil wealth and suppressed the info for 30+ years.  Afterr decades of neglect we have the worst social housing depravation in W/Europe + 1in 4 children living in poverty yet spend £200bn on WMD.
1309 2018-11-25 22:08:56 So jel  my basic advice is anything without Sodium Laurel Sulphate (SLS) and silicones (ending in ‘one’ or ‘xane’) is good for curls. My hair loves regular conditioning with coconut oil too
1310 2018-11-25 22:08:55 Oil lovers are like Blackberry owners. “I would never give up the hard keyboard” said the masses. It is not about Tesla - it is about a mindset change towards viable electric driven economy and in this Tesla and Elon have played a huge part in Electrics crossing the chasm.

1312 2018-11-25 22:08:48 Alberta has a lot to lose, and oil isn’t Alberta’s sole industry.
1313 2018-11-25 22:08:44 i need a oil change
1314 2018-11-25 22:08:38 We get only about 10% of our oil from Saudi Arabia but get 40% from Canada. Think Trump is supporting MBS because he PERSONALLY benefits financially. Saudis have spent millions buying Trump properties, stay at his hotels, etc.
1315 2018-11-25 22:08:36 They scattered like rats. Next time vats of boiling oil

1318 2018-11-25 22:08:24 You obviously don't understand how donations work. If someone works as a cashier at a QuikTrip and they give $10--they have to list their employer--and that is considered the gas & oil industry--is that the "dirty corporate money" to which you refer? Give me a break.
1319 2018-11-25 22:08:20 We can’t rely on oil profits anymore. We need more revenue.
1320 2018-11-25 22:08:05 Unfortunately the rest of the world is going to continue to burn that oil. We need to develop an affordable alternative. Like hydrogen. Or, build neutron bombs and cut the earth's population in half. Maybe a global natural disaster like an asteroid or major volcanic eruption -
1321 2018-11-25 22:08:03 WCS costs $52 to produce and sells for $17. The TM pipeline will not raise its price above the WTI benchmark of $51. Upgrading TM is not viable.

Perhaps the existing TM pumping conventional oil will eventually pay for itself. Is that the plan?
1322 2018-11-25 22:07:56 Gotta get my damn oil changed
1323 2018-11-25 22:07:50 So the oil and coal companies don't want to spend money on research that says they're not harming the environment? LOL!
1324 2018-11-25 22:07:39 Yeah, climate researchers are super rich. Not as rich as their colleagues working in the oil industry, though. Hello?
1325 2018-11-25 22:07:21 He hasn’t given a pass to #SaudiArabia STRONG restrictions & sanctions that’s why Oil prices are so good right now etc! #Khashoggi had ties to #MuslimBrotherhood #BinLaden had no #greencard he was a guest that abused his rights birds of a feather flock together..that can be fatal
1326 2018-11-25 22:07:21 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
1327 2018-11-25 22:07:11 How many times kuma, some even use phone torch
1328 2018-11-25 22:07:10 You think preventing the removal of more oil and increasing the size of the areas of land protected from development does nothing for the environment? What about clean air plan? Or air pollution limits? Strengthening EPA actions against chemicals? None of these help?
1329 2018-11-25 22:07:04 crazy people talk about themselves like that, no rallies so you have to pat yourself on the back, odder and odder, the fed looks at everything not just oil and guess what inflation is up dumbo
1330 2018-11-25 22:06:53 You gotta understand...the Executive Branch of the US GOVT is CONTROLLED by the OIL MONOPOLY and HAS BEEN FOR YEARS. ANY ADDICTION is hard to "shake" ask ANY heroin addict.
1331 2018-11-25 22:06:52 Can't believe that I missed this . Recently went back to texlaxed/relaxed hair & I know my hair LOVES castor oil. Going to try and do this myself . Hopefully I don't miss the next one

1334 2018-11-25 22:06:37 If you're taking credit for falling oil prices, then I guess you need to take credit for the falling stock market & the increasing budget deficit & the increasing national debt & the increasing trade deficit...
1335 2018-11-25 22:06:31 your skin looks oil
1336 2018-11-25 22:06:30 I buy everyone two vials, one oil of frankincense, another, oil of myrrh. Also a bit of gold leaf.

Christmas shopping done.

Good enough for baby Jesus, good enough for all.
1337 2018-11-25 22:06:23 1. RF has annexed Crimea. Crimeans don't mind.
2. Captured Ukrainian oil platforms, Ukraine does nothing about it.
3. Supported civilians on Donbass as Ukraine started the war
4. Got framed for shooting down MH17
5. Supports Asad in fight against ISIS
6. We need the context.

1340 2018-11-25 22:06:03 We get more oil from Canada too. Trump has got to go!He has no grasp on reality.He’s ruining our country,our democracy,or friendships with allied countries in preference to dictators.This is not my America and,I will what I can to take it back from the claws of corruption of GOP

It's a my breakfast. Also,tomato juice.
1346 2018-11-25 22:05:35 That's awful. Have you tried all types of chocolate? I mean if you just had v. plain chocolate it might b ok (she suggested hopefully) - & does the chocolate have palm oil in? I've had some funny feelings incl. dry mouth & tummy upset when I've accidentally eaten stuff with it in
1347 2018-11-25 22:05:22 Dear Ukraine, don't look to the US for aid or sensible comment. It is Russia who violated you and we know how much Trump loves Vlad. I'm sure you heard about the Journalist who he traded for a Barrell of Oil! Sorry!
1348 2018-11-25 22:05:21 Oil perfumes 12ml for N1500,50ml for N3500,100ml for 7000..sprays 50ml for 1500,100ml for 3000
1349 2018-11-25 22:05:18 Life on Earth threatening disaster,   and they are afraid of some government regulations...

btw...no "everyday citizen" would be effected...  mainly oil and gas.. and industry...
1350 2018-11-25 22:05:09 But what about the poor, poor, environment exploiting oil companies? Who thinks about those poor people?
1351 2018-11-25 22:05:07 Putin has stolen all this oil money and is using his power to flex his Tiny Short Muscles.
1352 2018-11-25 22:05:07 They’ve stated that they don’t take pac money but the dark money still flows to O’rourke regardless, in the form of maximum individual donations $2500/per transaction multiplied over and over. He’s taken more money from big oil than almost anyone else, Cruz included, whata lefty!
1353 2018-11-25 22:04:50 Thanks for posting this 
1354 2018-11-25 22:04:47 I’m sure Asda petrol is 50% sunflower oil because the way it finishes is too mad
1355 2018-11-25 22:04:47 Oil and Gas value plays!
1356 2018-11-25 22:04:46 the pastor put oil on my forehead and all I was thinking about was him messing up my makeup.
1357 2018-11-25 22:04:35 Mmmm love getting an oil change 5 days ago just for it to all uhhhhhhh leak back out likely due to a service error.
1358 2018-11-25 22:04:34 Unless that NAIA school is sitting in the middle of oil country in your state, I guess. (See UNM vs University of the Southwest in Hobbs on 12/30)
1359 2018-11-25 22:04:31 They should be dealt with according to the law of the land, this is uncalled for and criminal.
1360 2018-11-25 22:04:25 I miss when oil money was floating around in excess, bout time I had a new wardrobe lol
1361 2018-11-25 22:04:24 NEVER.  If @TomPerez let's that snake a
Oil salesmen back on a Dem ticket, I'm changing my affiliation to I.  I'll never give the DNC another dime.
It's bad enough he let the #FakeDem dictate the Dem platform.  He's used & abused our party enough. #GoAwayBernie
1362 2018-11-25 22:04:16 Hate to break it to you but there is no cure. Nobody wants tar oil.
Oil use in transportation will peak in 7 years or less. When it does tar oil is worthless.
No amount of welfare will help it.
1363 2018-11-25 22:04:15 If I didnt know better I'd wonder If oil had dropped $25 in a few weeks....
1364 2018-11-25 22:04:05 宜しくお願いします！

1370 2018-11-25 22:03:39 You are correct if there were no requests for more oil from KSA to score political points. I tend to think there was.
1371 2018-11-25 22:03:35 I'll play Oil Mac's wife...
1372 2018-11-25 22:03:33 Oil Interest Motivated
1373 2018-11-25 22:03:33 The forecast for Iranian GDP growth in 2020 is 1%, but if oil prices remain low (and given that Iran is selling at discount) it could be somewhat lower, though I doubt it will be negative.
1374 2018-11-25 22:03:18 Whelp... what is a pipeline going to solve? A higher price for dirty oil... sign me up. NOT. You say conspiracy, I say fact. America has been lobbying to keep that pipe from being built for a while@now.
It’s benefits them to have cheap oil coming from good ole Canada...
1375 2018-11-25 22:03:08 Oil right know will be down on any news including  a Toys ‘ r ‘us bankruptcy

1378 2018-11-25 22:02:57 It’s time for you to give up all your wealth you are destroying the environment on your oil based devices stop using electricity live like the Amish
1379 2018-11-25 22:02:50 パンさんおはようございます！
1380 2018-11-25 22:02:41 Hash oil
1381 2018-11-25 22:02:39 Just had to force it. Other people told me to put oil on it to prevent it from freezing so I hope it won't happen again
1382 2018-11-25 22:02:32 3/4 of Americans don’t know where the U.S. gets its oil from
The U.S. only imports 40% of the oil it uses; the other 60% is produced in the U.S.
Half of the oil the U.S. imports is from North and South America; less than 1/4 of imported oil comes from the Middle East
1383 2018-11-25 22:02:32 Actually Ed, we get  most of our imported oil from Canada, not the Saudis.  Trump is spouting bullshit again.  Only MAGAs believe him
1384 2018-11-25 22:02:27 When in reality, maintaining the status quo and denying action to address climate change makes Big Oil big profits. I wonder how much they pay @RickSantorum to be a shill for them?
1385 2018-11-25 22:02:22 APPLY CLAY MASKS

Clay masks can help to minimize the appearance of pores by drawing out any clogged dirt, oil and dead skin cells. Clay also reduces inflammation and can kill bacteria.
1386 2018-11-25 22:02:13 United didn’t do it all through oil money like city and Chelsea
1387 2018-11-25 22:02:13 Real reasons behind this shit today - Ukrainian shortage of Gas & Oil from one and angry citizens from the other side. This is provocation to make another conflict just to save ass of their rich president to not be downed from ,,throne,,. with or without mercy.
1388 2018-11-25 22:02:10 I’ve been using lotta body moisturiser and I toyed with aloe Vera yesterday - as a pre poo and my hair has been feeling so silky since then. I also wash with black soap+ castor oil blend.
1389 2018-11-25 22:02:09 300 thousand jobs green energy 95 thousand oil 15 thousand coal yeah AMERICA
1390 2018-11-25 22:02:08 Bro, you clearly haven't met the oil fairies. Married couple that bought VR recently and come shitpost with us, best fucking thing ever.
1391 2018-11-25 22:02:06 Are you kidding??  You actually thanked YOURSELF??  It’s obviously not possible that you even grasp your level of narcissism!  And by the way, the smart guys are saying the fall in oil prices are tanking the market.   I (and my retirement account) both hate you.
1392 2018-11-25 22:02:06 Oil usage will be on the rise for the next 35 years before it starts to decline like it or not.
1393 2018-11-25 22:02:06 Have put some @JoshWoodColour oil in my hair for an overnight treatment. Hoping it works wonders.
1394 2018-11-25 22:01:58 This has been a rough couple of lifting form videos on youtube so now all I want is hot oil noodles
1395 2018-11-25 22:01:55 2/...in their vehicle market, set to decline for the first year in decades as EV storm the China market even harder. Result: a forecasted flat year ahead in China petrol demand. Oil was testing high levels as these demand shifts unfolded. As always, oil ultra-sensitive at margin.
1396 2018-11-25 22:01:53 What in case they run out of oil? Sneaky devils.
1397 2018-11-25 22:01:45 There's the Rosneft oil deal quid pro quo that Mike Flynn's job was to get sanctions lifted Feb 2017 (2014 sanctions imposed by Obama re: Russia annexing Crimea). This would've allowed Tillerson's Exxon to partner w/ Rosneft so Trump/Kushner could line their pockets with deal.
1398 2018-11-25 22:01:34 A lot of people my age put towels under their door to lock in the scent of weed. I do it to lock in the scent of lavendar and lemon from my essential oil diffuser. Adulthood!

1400 2018-11-25 22:01:30 EXFOLIATE

Exfoliating helps to remove dead skin cells, which would otherwise mix with dirt and oil on the surface of your skin, causing blocked pores.
1401 2018-11-25 22:01:22 LOLS.

*someone tell her no one likes snark please
1402 2018-11-25 22:01:19 Turkey Sub on white, toasted, with white American, garlic pickles, jalapeno peppers, oil & vinegar, and spicy mustard
1403 2018-11-25 22:01:06 Omg we know you didn’t do it! Also we get more oil from Canada than Saudi Arabia and they don’t butcher reporters. You are disgusting
1404 2018-11-25 22:00:59 Crimea was a Black sea oil grab.   Putin et al & Exxon were greatly effected by sanctions.   Clinton would have tightened them.    This current administration does not see this as a crisis; they're playing for the other team.
1405 2018-11-25 22:00:58 2/2 resources rather than buy unethical oil. Market value for resources, use of Cdn products in Cda, job creation & transfer payments are all positive byproducts of Cda’s Oil & Gas industry.  Business will create jobs - Gov’t only needs to keep us competitive. #voteprosperity2019
1406 2018-11-25 22:00:55 KEEP UR FACE CLEAN

When pores become clogged with dirt and oil, they can appear larger and more noticeable. Therefore, it is important to keep your face clean in order to minimize the amount of dirt and oil on the surface of the skin.
1407 2018-11-25 22:00:54 おはようございます
1408 2018-11-25 22:00:50 Looking for help mapping the maritime flow of Arctic oil from Valdez, AK to distant ports. Do historians/ geographers have a good mapping tool/ app that allows me show the spatial movement of oil? (I know where the oil flowed, I just want to map it) #envhist #historicalgeography
1409 2018-11-25 22:00:49 It would take a lot of olive oil to fit him into Hamiltons car.....
1410 2018-11-25 22:00:44 You just can’t help taking credit for things that have nothing to do with you, can you! Oil prices fall a bit and it is the best thing ever to “President T.” I can’t wait until the stock market crashes! You gonna take credit for that too?
1411 2018-11-25 22:00:37 We've heard it since the first drops of oil hit the ground. We're undeserving of such good fortune, and we'll only squander it anyway. If not for our dumb luck we'd still be hard scrabble dirt farmers...etc.You're more tactful than most but the derision is there just the same.
1412 2018-11-25 22:00:35 Honestly I’m just buying little things that will come in handy lol salt pepper. Eggs and cheese. Cooking oil Like random stuff we will need eventually.
1413 2018-11-25 22:00:29 Trump-speak translation: Russia wants to break NATO, so I'm doing my part. Make it easier for Russia to become the dominant world power - as long as I get my share of the state oil company Rosneft.

1417 2018-11-25 22:00:15 I haven't used oil pastels in years so my confidence with them is 0 and yet I'm using them to colour a drawing I've done for my girlfriend. Why do I want to suffer????
1418 2018-11-25 22:00:14 Bangali goodnight!Did you read the tweet properly I mean just the thought of mayonnaise and palm oil 
1419 2018-11-25 22:00:06 They're broke... can't afford a shit anymore and will get a further transfer ban anyway. Oil club slowly but surely falling apart...
1420 2018-11-25 21:59:57 Is oil production not a failed business model?
1421 2018-11-25 21:59:55 Find it so strange that everyone is suddenly “cutting palm oil” out their lives but are still eating meat 3 meals a day like that isn’t also polluting and destroying the planet  I did a project on palm oil and over 3/4 of participants didn’t even know what it was in
1422 2018-11-25 21:59:53 This can make Canada & our allies take our oil. WATCH WHAT YOU WISH FOR AS 45 IS today bragging about false low gas prices. Sanctions works against us too. That wall works both ways.
1423 2018-11-25 21:59:49 The Canadian Broadcasting Company publicly schooled you with this humiliating fact-check:

The United States only imports 11% of its oil from Saudia Arabia. The lion’s share, 40%, comes from Canada.
1424 2018-11-25 21:59:47 The moron doesn’t realize that dropping oil means oil related jobs and industries will lay-off people.
1425 2018-11-25 21:59:40 The palm oil advert from @IcelandFoods is just tremendous! I’m vowing to stop using palm oil.
1426 2018-11-25 21:59:37 Yeah, again, you don’t have a lot directly to do with oil prices. And btw low oil prices don’t help your Saudi buddies. Also nice try but making the dumb tax cut analogy won’t work - except for your MAGAts and the Press. #ImpeachTrumpNow
1427 2018-11-25 21:59:33 1/The fall in the price of oil has unfolded over two, bearish trailing trends: third year flat demand for US gasoline and gently declining vehicle sales as EV storm the margin. And now, one new trend: downward revisions to China demand, on the back of a real crack....
1428 2018-11-25 21:59:06 So shaft that oil prices are boobs (thank you Crackhouse T). Tail Water that, which is dislike a nuts Tax Blow, to our diddle bad Mumbling In The Moss rag. Deflation up (are you listening Fed)!
1429 2018-11-25 21:58:55 Bombardier,  oil companies, auto Industry, dairy farmers,  all your buddies
1430 2018-11-25 21:58:54 I bet Bradley Cooper is the type of boyfriend who will change your car’s oil and then read you a poem he wrote about love in French.
1431 2018-11-25 21:58:52 “Lucas Oil Stadium is a three day orgasm” ~@Yo_is_that_Jack
1432 2018-11-25 21:58:42 He’s not responsible for gas prices coming down. And btw, Canada produces almost 4 times as much oil as the Saudis. Stop repeating statements made by that moron President T. Parroting his #FakeNews doesn’t make it true.
1433 2018-11-25 21:58:39 Gotta get an oil change
1434 2018-11-25 21:58:36 Do I feel comfortable with the idea of “deplatforming” in general? Not necessarily no, but I think we need to remember that those declaring they’re being silenced are often not interested in an actual debate in the first place, it’s an opportunity for a platform to sell snake oil
1435 2018-11-25 21:58:29 Haha. Saw I was totally late to the game on that. I’m new to Twitter.
1436 2018-11-25 21:58:26 Well, that's how I see WWF and Tesco's new partnership and clearly Greenpeace was happy for Iceland to promote its palm oil campaign. 2b fair, Britvic's gone further than most 2 reduce sugar: but how much further will/can it go? It actually 2nd-guessed #sugartax hence low tax yld
1437 2018-11-25 21:58:22 The only thing I’m mad @ is that they too some good pancakes and poured MOTOR OIL ON IT

1441 2018-11-25 21:58:05 No. Thats not correct. Indeed if your assertion was correct what about the US that produces more LNG and Oil than opec while increasing forrestation?
1442 2018-11-25 21:57:54 Ameen Yah Allah 
1443 2018-11-25 21:57:52 Getting the car oil changed at Scrubby Sex Press Lube. I honestly expected more cake of the Beefy and Cheesy variety.

1445 2018-11-25 21:57:48 If they were serious about getting Alberta heavy oil  to alternative-to-US markets,  they would have proposed a TMPx leg from Kamloops to Prince Rupert, not Burnaby.

I took care of my hair and put coconut oil on it. A thing that I haven't done in a while.
Good night! And take care of yourself 
1454 2018-11-25 21:56:21 Lol, Norway cannot produce anymore, they are approaching max production and US oil and LNG is 30% more expensive as it involves shipping costs.
Russian gas and oil are the cheapest options for Europe, like it ore not, sanctioning it will cause MASSIVE economic damage for the EU.
1455 2018-11-25 21:56:21 Really? At this point in history? May is going to threaten to cut off the supply of oil? The whiskey? The ability to feed itself (Scotland can, rUK not so much)? The potential for renewable energy? The fishing grounds? She can keep the tanking pound.
1456 2018-11-25 21:56:04 Cooking shows have ruined dining for idiots. If this guy refers to the oil and balsamic on their plate as a “reduction” again I’m going to lose it.
1457 2018-11-25 21:56:02 But who cares about his effing nick name, whats he doing interferring in global market oil prices. Has he got Saudies over a barrel (oops)
1458 2018-11-25 21:55:53 Gas and Oil pays big money to have internet up here. Their is Satellite. Telecommunication companies that must by law, in most areas. So yeah, keep talking out your ass. Seriously, you have no idea how it works here but act like you know more then everyone else up here.
1459 2018-11-25 21:55:50 Stupid person Doesn’t realise who is one of their biggest buyers of weapons and owner of their debt oh and main supplier of oil. So basically owns majority of their policies and support majority of his parties interests.... #America

1480 2018-11-25 21:53:42 I don't think your supporters were thinking falling oil prices are the same as a big tax cut ( also not something you capitalize) which was a lie and oil prices cannot be attributed to you or your alter ego "President T". Please hire a grade school English teacher.

1483 2018-11-25 21:53:30 Get ready for traffic, make sure you check your oil and such on a  semi-regular basis. No one can drive in the rain (it gets greasy on the roads, it's legit harder than in areas with more rain). Don't worry if you aren't by the fun stuff, it's easy and expected to travel.
1484 2018-11-25 21:53:27 oil prices are dropping because nobody can afford to travel and be killed in a mass gun or bombing, they have families to raise..

1487 2018-11-25 21:53:24 The price of oil is falling due to the fact that the “It's all about me” guy has scared the crap out of international markets with among other things, his reckless tariffs and his bumbling of foreign relations. So, thank you for lower prices, just not for the reasons you think.
1488 2018-11-25 21:53:09 Trump's 'Personal financial interests' driving policy in the Gulf - this is the lame Dems take now circulating. Its the same damn bipartisan policy US has had for 80 years - since Roosevelt struck a deal with Saudi King Abdulaziz in 1945: oil for security.

1491 2018-11-25 21:52:56 Funny, you didn't take responsibility when oil prices went up.
And you haven't taken responsibility for the S&P 500 being down 10% but you gladly claimed credit for the stock market performance when it was up.
Hmm... I think I see a pattern here.
1492 2018-11-25 21:52:52 Most ICE vehicles need at least an oil change after 13K miles. Also, regenerative braking means brakes last longer too.

1495 2018-11-25 21:52:37 There are no such things as "cheap Russian resources". Europe just increases own production eg. Norwegian oil and import of US oil and LNG.

I consider Edinburgh to be a 'rich beyond dreams' city. Finance and tourism are our oil, from which a strong wealth fund can be made if desired.
1523 2018-11-25 21:49:41 Instead, NATO will accept higher oil prices
1524 2018-11-25 21:49:40 Again I would rather pay more for gas and oil then give up what we as American's stand for. You sold America to MBS for what?

1531 2018-11-25 21:49:09 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
1532 2018-11-25 21:49:03 I could explain how we can successfully export our oil and you can come back with reasons it'll fail; or you could just be honest and say you want us to fail. Maybe then we'd be a little less uppity and know our role. I'm used to it. The Laurentian mindset is a common one...
1533 2018-11-25 21:49:02 Burning oil is bad and the earth is dying
1534 2018-11-25 21:49:01 You’re taking credit for low oil prices? This is caused by a glut of petroleum on the planet at the moment. By the way, fuel prices are higher now than they were last year. Just shut up. Keep protecting the Saudi’s, bitch.

If you are going down ANY of those...stop. None of them lead to anything good.
1539 2018-11-25 21:48:28 Calling out @EnergyCredit1 and @ZmansEnrgyBrain:

Trump taking credit for low oil prices means just as little as Trump taking credit for high stock prices: nothing.

1543 2018-11-25 21:48:12 If the price of oil increases so much that it causes a global financial collapse, wouldn't that be bad for China and its hope of becoming the next superpower?

1545 2018-11-25 21:47:58 This lie is so obsolete, pdp would have given Buhari a technical knock out by reserving minimum of $200b in our reserves by late 2014 just like Algeria did with a $194b in savings, lets see where the hunger will come from.
Lets not forget Nigeria sold more oil than Algeria.
1546 2018-11-25 21:47:58 oil is a tight commodity, supply/demand in tight sync and all producers sell market price. Thing is that the producers are very very diverse but we will focus on the 3 factors that truly differentiate: cost of production, amount of available reserves, and financial situation.
1547 2018-11-25 21:47:54 Americans are paying almost $1 more per gal for gasoline since the day of your poorly attended inauguration. Why don’t gasoline prices reflect the drop in oil prices? Sad.

1571 2018-11-25 21:45:57 Oil & gas will continue to expand fossil fuel extraction under the guise of "clean tech" if you reference only emissions; back to regulating a practice that has been self-regulated for decades; must take a direct bite out of extraction itself.

1573 2018-11-25 21:45:43 Another example, why do oil company executives & shareholders not bear unlimited personal liability for oil spills? Shouldn't an oil spill like Exxon Valdez or the Gulf Oil Spill wipe out those companies? The Gov't should seize those assets and sell them to pay for the cleanup

1596 2018-11-25 21:43:23 My thoughts exactly. Why, and how, is so called 'Fem farming' any different from any other farming? Particularly in terms of buying power. I've not heard that anyone sells Fem barbed wire, or Fem oil. If your neighbour is a bloke, he should be part of the buying group.
1597 2018-11-25 21:43:17 They don’t ask for consultations about foreign oil or giant ships passing through our channels so it is a little questionable as the intent here. There is no scrutiny of measure over foreign oil GHG so why Canada? Bands opposing all have cars and most own gas stations...

1606 2018-11-25 21:42:26 Rose hip oil twice a day!
1607 2018-11-25 21:42:22 Apparently you haven’t heard.  It’s all thanks to @fordnation in Ontario.  Ya.  He’s got a hand in the cost of oil across the globe.  Ask him, he’ll tell ya.  #onpoli
1608 2018-11-25 21:42:22 What do you mean by our government isn’t buying oil?
1609 2018-11-25 21:42:21 The disdain PMJT has towards the west and oil in general is quite evident.  Bills preventing pipelines, afraid to challenge rulings to build pipelines, and then a bailout to outlets typically critical of pipelines is disturbing.
1610 2018-11-25 21:41:53 Any proof of this outrageous assertion? @realDonaldTrump is overly candid of why we have this relationship- it’s oil, if you take this for granted you might visit Paris which is on fire over gas prices right now.
1611 2018-11-25 21:41:49 @realDonaldTrump The gas and oil prices dropped after the Dems took over the House ! Idiot
1612 2018-11-25 21:41:48 I like how hes been spanking OPEC. From what I read he isn't cutting them any slack. They aren't going to have as much control over the price of oil with President Trump in office.
1613 2018-11-25 21:41:48 Anybody on here do oil changes? I have to drive a very long distance super suddenly and there’s no way I can do it without one. Hit me up! #baltimore #dmv #oilchange #mechanic #help
1614 2018-11-25 21:41:47 I was dead ass looking for the cooking oil for like 25 minutes, my mom put inside a Jose Cuervo mix bottle. Lmfaoooo
1615 2018-11-25 21:41:47 Nothing is more disrespectful to me than giving me jollof rice that's at the bottom of the cooler. That's where all the oil is.
1616 2018-11-25 21:41:40 Libya because of oil.
1617 2018-11-25 21:41:39 but the conflict structure began to include not only oil interests but also religious conflicts, it is becoming too complicated and it is getting out of hand Is not it?
There is little judgment material for an individual.
1618 2018-11-25 21:41:37 Pleased to see the price of diesel finally coming down... This still doesn't make up for the times that oil was at its lowest and the garages still inflated the prices... Greedy ducks
1619 2018-11-25 21:41:35 Even better than minced garlic: garlic oil. Plus, I agree with those saying the mincers are too much of a pain to clean.

1622 2018-11-25 21:41:29 I got cloves, orajel and putting tea tree oil. I got a crazy headache man
1623 2018-11-25 21:41:24 Even people who are about to be layed off from the oil fields are defending trump no matter what so Fox News has to do the same.
1624 2018-11-25 21:41:24 Checklist for countdown:

Good vibes
1625 2018-11-25 21:41:24 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
1626 2018-11-25 21:41:24 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1627 2018-11-25 21:41:19 Oil change.
1628 2018-11-25 21:41:15 I can change your oil at my shop whenever you need, just get the oil and filter!

1630 2018-11-25 21:41:14 Dude. I wish I could trebuchet it to you. Ginger, garlic, chilli, cilantro, sesame seed oil
1631 2018-11-25 21:41:13 Mr president, You have a calll, France is on call waiting.   Something to do about oil prices, I presume.
1632 2018-11-25 21:41:06 Hi Amy. Your pizza with blue cheese and motor oil will be delivered in 21 min via tank.
1633 2018-11-25 21:41:05 Sorry you're correct...I mis-typed. It actually has the second highest rate IN THE WHOLE OF EUROPE. It's a wonder how their government can't fix those problems with all that oil money. Luckily people in Scotland don't have any issues with alcohol, drug addiction or debt. 
1634 2018-11-25 21:41:05 Man listen. My wisdom tooth. I have clove oil and orajel an some it’s still BAD my jaw swole i can’t even eat smh
1635 2018-11-25 21:41:05 My hair is full courtesy genes I guess, and it's always been colour 1, never dyed. Castor oil massages might work for you. Massaging the scalp everyday with the oil. And don't do too much. Let it breathe sometimes. Hope that helped abit
1636 2018-11-25 21:41:03 ooo bio oil has made a gel 
1637 2018-11-25 21:40:54 When a vegan restaurant posts that they'll be selling Oreo Rocky Road tomorrow and you fight the urge to be like ''Oreos........ aren't those the biscuits with the palm oil in them?''
1638 2018-11-25 21:40:53 Oil prices are down because of the demonstrations in France  due to high oil prices. Have you been watching world news lately or not?
1639 2018-11-25 21:40:50 Takai fa??? Ko kuma A A Zaura???
1640 2018-11-25 21:40:34 I don't doubt it. But can you prove it? I assume you've also seen the evidence of US, UK and Israeli weapons, supplies, and military assistance being provided to ISIS?
And also evidence of the Turks buying ISIS oil?

1642 2018-11-25 21:40:17 Southampton could win the league by 2025. It took them lot across the road less time to be a nothing club into premier league champions. Get the right people in and it’ll work. Our advantage being we don’t need an oil guy and spend billions!

1648 2018-11-25 21:40:08 I remember when gas was $.18/gal. Prices go up and down continually. You have very little influence over the price of oil. Speaking of tax cut, when will the middle class get theirs?
1649 2018-11-25 21:40:08 Mudahan aku nda gve up tu jak la 
1650 2018-11-25 21:40:07 That’s 10 receiving TDs for Ebron and 34 straight games with a scoring pass for Andrew Luck. Off to a Chiefs-Rams kind of start at Lucas Oil Stadium. #Colts
1651 2018-11-25 21:40:05 The Texas gas and oil gluttons are everywhere here in PA. Taking up every square foot of field, meadow, untouched countryside they can gobble up.  Mud all over the roads, truck traffic.  Sickening.

1654 2018-11-25 21:39:52 I used vitamin e oil for the skin. My skin is the same way, i used pods before this and it just wasn’t keeping it moisturize throughout the day.
1655 2018-11-25 21:39:51 They want to create a crisis to push oil prices up.
1656 2018-11-25 21:39:50 It’s not the coal, oil and gas, it’s the MONEY they make from it..$billions around the world EVERY DAY in fact..so it is vulture capitalism killing the planet. Just as much thought and investment has to go towards alternative income sources as is going into renewables.
1657 2018-11-25 21:39:44 Oooooooo nooooooo! How will the essential oil industry ever survive?
1658 2018-11-25 21:39:41 your eyes are olive oil ooo

1661 2018-11-25 21:39:37 And why do you think you are responsible for lower oil prices? Oh yes, you graduated from Trump University!  You must know what you are talking about.
1662 2018-11-25 21:39:34 And I guess i would ask if the same standard should apply to the oil and gas sector. Cause there are a lot of direct and I direct taxpayer dollars in play there.
1663 2018-11-25 21:39:33 Okay I’m gone talk her into it  you know her ass said she wasn’t fucking wit us after that baby oil 
1664 2018-11-25 21:39:21 Virgin Coconut Oil kills Alzheimer and it's a proven fact
1665 2018-11-25 21:39:21 There was no more oil in the house, nor were there any candles.（家にはもう油がなく、ろうそくもありませんでした。）
1666 2018-11-25 21:39:17 Oil prices are falling because everyone sees the huge Trump recession just around the corner.
Putting lots of Trump voters in shale country out of jobs too. Sad!
1667 2018-11-25 21:39:16 Some of us are making arguments for independence based on not extracting the oil. What chance do you think there is of Westminster deciding to keep it in the ground?
1668 2018-11-25 21:38:47 As I stated above, the anti-everything crowd conveniently ignores what the oil sands look(ed) like before being cleaned & what the cleaned reclaimed land looks like after the procedure. Remember, this is one of nature's biggest environmental messes which we are trying to rectify.
1669 2018-11-25 21:38:44 I use Marinol which is the synthetic version of THC plus CBD Oil which contain cannabinoids, the other active ingredients in cannabis.

Marinol by script because my doc is able to code it properly. CBD Oil (although I take capsules) is out of pocket and very expensive.
1670 2018-11-25 21:38:31 Actually the bulk of US oil imports come from Canada which sells them to the US at a 40% discount.
1671 2018-11-25 21:38:29 Toh wa za kuyi???
1672 2018-11-25 21:38:27 Saudis are lowering oil prices to kill US fracking . . .
1673 2018-11-25 21:38:26 I guess you guys got your piece of the pie.  Trudeau is killing Alberta.  Sure, it would be cool to be a global innovator in the unicorn market.  But we have oil and gas.  So let's focus on what we have and not waste the investment in infrastructure that's already gone into this
1674 2018-11-25 21:38:14 Blue is definitely not my favourite colour and soo is your team...water and oil don’t mix Aaay.we can never be in this together
1675 2018-11-25 21:38:12 Homemade!! Avocado, honey, conditioner, warm oil, one egg & mayo! You’ll smell like a sandwich kinda but your hair gonna love it
1676 2018-11-25 21:38:09 You do not control nor do you have ANY influence over the market price of oil you self centred windbag! Market price is determined by supply and demand and currently there is an over abundance of oil available. Oil price is only one of the factors that determines inflation.
1677 2018-11-25 21:38:08 Saudi bottomed out the price of oil to try to attack Russia, Venezuela, Iran ( on its return to the oil markets) and, laughably, the American fracking Industry.

This would be a stressful, high risk medium term strategy (more than one year) for any country

1680 2018-11-25 21:37:57 Defending Canadian media funding is defending "Canadian culture", while the oil industry is merely a Provincial economic issue that, "truth be told..." muss aufhebung werden.

1683 2018-11-25 21:37:54 “Jump Bikes are for the hip urban kids.” This suburban dad just dropped off the car @JiffyLube. Hopped on a Jump Bike and spent an hour on the patio at Low Brau in midtown waiting an oil change. Cost: $49 for service, $2 for bike, $8 for beer. #UrbanMobility #DadHack #JumpBikes
1684 2018-11-25 21:37:54 Well, you’ll definitely find a friendly ear in Finch. He & Fi are like oil and water. Lol

She’s gruff for sure..but a sharp cookie on a lot of things too. Noteworthy background.

I got caught in crossfire with her trying to make peace in their last dustup.

Keeping head down.
1685 2018-11-25 21:37:54 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
1686 2018-11-25 21:37:54 And snake oil salesmen...oh mate 
1687 2018-11-25 21:37:50 Oil down another 5% and that will be enuf for Monday.
1688 2018-11-25 21:37:47 I just wanna smell like ouai rose hair and body oil all the time
1689 2018-11-25 21:37:40 You know what is scary, is the amount Russians gave Hillary and Bill and that wasn't secret...I wonder how much Russia gave Trump. He thinks he is so sneaky getting close with Israel and encouraging their supply of gas and oil to Europe.
1690 2018-11-25 21:37:39 Paul Stamets is the leading voice in the battle 2 demystify fungi & get folks talking about the benefits the possess for humans, mental illness is only 1, also dementia (lions mane) & cleaning oil spills, battling radiation, some love radioactive substrate very interacting orgnsm
1691 2018-11-25 21:37:34 I’d say they are doing it to get oil prices to rise.  Geopolitical risk does things like that.
1692 2018-11-25 21:37:31 Digging for oil?
1693 2018-11-25 21:37:26 Both are smokescreens for the real issue: if we stop burning fuel, trillions of dollars worth of oil field holdings become worthless. The economy is just fine, but a whole lot of wealth disappears.
1694 2018-11-25 21:37:22 I know a guy, @PMBaumgarten

One thing, hair loss is definitely from my lack of protein. Solved after I increase protein intake to: 1/2 my weight in LBs  convert to grams of protein a day.
1700 2018-11-25 21:36:55 Once again, you have nothing to do with the falling oil prices and it definitely had nothing to do with your tax scam. Inflation is not down, it's been going up steadily since you have been in office. You are the Liar-in-Chief. RESIGN and MAGA.
1701 2018-11-25 21:36:45 Hey #Shit4Brains you have no control over oil prices
1702 2018-11-25 21:36:41 I'll bet you don't even realize that falling gas prices hurt U.S. oil companies like Halliburton do you?  Which in turn hurt states like Wyoming.  But of course all you care about are your buddies the Saudi's.
1703 2018-11-25 21:36:31 re: lrt the motor oil especially hurt my feelings
1704 2018-11-25 21:36:24 Has anyone ever tried the essential oil aromatherapy things that look like vapes?
1705 2018-11-25 21:36:20 Mr. President, oil and gas prices always go up before and during a major holiday.  They go down after the holiday is over.  This will happen again just prior to Christmas.  Get the prices to not go up prior to the next big holiday, that is a better help to us financially.
1706 2018-11-25 21:36:09 Ask the question again after gov and big oil finish bribing all peoples along the pipeline.

1712 2018-11-25 21:35:52 Roman Quaedvlieg represents everything that is wrong with Australia. He plays on our national gullibility and inherently naive approach to spin & “snake oil” charm. While undeniably suave and articulate, Quaedvlieg had no qualms about implementing Dutton’s unconscionable agenda!
1713 2018-11-25 21:35:50 You need to explain to @POTUS that really low oil prices aren’t necessarily good for our economy these days. It will actually hurt us.....
1714 2018-11-25 21:35:44 The thing I like about baking these simple sweets is that you can always make them healthier: I used sunflower seeds oil instead of butter and low fat Greek yogurt instead of whole milk and the end result is still delicious lol 
1715 2018-11-25 21:35:39 In Stonebrier Mall and a pushy Vine  Vera rep tried to block myself and my husband to push her snake oil to a woman walking next to us, We rebuffed her efforts by saying #itsatrap and don’t do it!
1716 2018-11-25 21:35:37 Hi hope you are well. I successfully run a business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love an opportunity to prove science wrong. When can I provide my service? I would love to do a collaboration with you. Thank you
1717 2018-11-25 21:35:35 Please do not forget that Big Oil has been in business with the Saudi's for many decades.  George W Bush has two failed oil ventures with them, for example.
1718 2018-11-25 21:35:30 Oil prices falling is NOT good for oil producing states or the thousands people with good jobs in the oil business.
1719 2018-11-25 21:35:09 FYI- oil prices are out of the President’s control. Guess you didn’t know that....
1720 2018-11-25 21:35:08 Nop sunan shigowar Fishaaaa kuma mugun Chika akayi
1721 2018-11-25 21:35:03 You have ZERO impact on OPEC and or the price of crude oil. Like your own operations, you are driving the country into the ground. The best drilling you do is screwing the majority of the wage earners.
1722 2018-11-25 21:35:03 What color would you like in your prison cell? They are having a sell at Lowe’s. They are all out of oil black.

1724 2018-11-25 21:35:02 No one is trying to justify the contamination from any kind of mining. However, conveniently left out of the debate is what the oil sands look like "before" being cleaned & what they look like "after" the cleaning & reclamation of the land.
You need to consider ALL the facts.
1725 2018-11-25 21:35:01 Hell yeah my dude. Get an oil cart and enjoy the freedom
1726 2018-11-25 21:34:54 Russian needs oil prices to spike. 
Not a coincidence.
1727 2018-11-25 21:34:53 That’s why we are suggesting people move to companies using sustainable palm oil.
1728 2018-11-25 21:34:49 Bought some cbd oil and lotion hoping it solves all my problems
1729 2018-11-25 21:34:49 The markets are unraveling. You really don’t understand oil do you President?
1730 2018-11-25 21:34:47 Oil reliance country's balance sheet will be impacted . Diversify. Commodity prices cannot be relied on. Invest more on food technology and drinking water. That will be a rare item soon.
1731 2018-11-25 21:34:45 Also grain is not important. And animal that eats grains, or straw/hay will produce dung capable of germinating "dung loving" spores. The more folks know, the less fear there will be of these organisms. I invite you to do some research on fungi in general. Some eat plastic & oil.
1732 2018-11-25 21:34:33 I don’t have a specific brand of essential oil, but I prefer the lemongrass or grapefruit lately.
1733 2018-11-25 21:34:25 Excuse me but how frigging dare you zoom so quickly past Big Q??? Sure, he drives fashion into the ground like it's a Jaguars defensive lineman every week. But we love Q most when he skulks outside the facility looking like he heard it was "free chicken nugget Sunday" @ Lucas Oil
1734 2018-11-25 21:34:25 Reserved spending figures are nonsense - also, WM has blown Scotland’s oil fund.
1735 2018-11-25 21:34:16 Solar is cheaper than oil and better for our environment. I have never seen such a selfish president
1736 2018-11-25 21:34:13 It is a public service. Dinesh has swindled people out of money and thought. He trades in lies and propaganda, he sells snake oil to gullible idiots. We that expose Dinesh do it for the good of the public discourse. I dont want to shut Dinesh up, I want you to know how he lies.
1737 2018-11-25 21:34:13 Because someone put motor oil on your pancakes?
1738 2018-11-25 21:34:12 The lower the price of oil the lower the employment of American oil workers
1739 2018-11-25 21:34:12 Because our media sucks? We had someone on global throwing out conspiracy theories about foreign money in Alberta oil and the news anchor just sat there buying it. CBC gave Gavin Mcinnes air time. What's going on? You guys give up or what
1740 2018-11-25 21:34:10 Have you tried those herbs you wrap round chicken, they are like greaseproof paper covered in herbs, throw them in the frying pan, no oil needed, they are yummy #CraftbizParty
1741 2018-11-25 21:34:03 It's funny how the @Heritage "economist" didn't mention the billions in tax subsidies the oil industry gets each year and has gotten for generations. The green energy industries deserve the same support.
1742 2018-11-25 21:34:00 Whc crowd?? Daman ansan zaizo kuma ba’a cikaba
1743 2018-11-25 21:34:00 Trudeau and his #1 enforcer Butts must be taking notes as they work hard to destroy the Canadian Oil and Gas Industry.
1744 2018-11-25 21:33:58 As far as I am concerned elite people seem to be hell bent on loving oil and continuing to pollute the Earth at the expense of many generations future which is very careless.
1745 2018-11-25 21:33:46 Except that religions has literally murdered scientist and people who did not agree with them.  Science doesn’t kill those with opposing views. So humans don’t get cancer from air pollution? Flint isn’t suffering from water pollution? Oil hasn’t destroyed the ocean?
1746 2018-11-25 21:33:43 What about states like Oklahoma where we are oil producers. We also build buildings that house the oil companies. Low oil prices are good for some people, but think about the people who work in the oil industry. Does it bother you when our local oil companies lay of thousands?
1747 2018-11-25 21:33:42 Amin Ya Rabbi
1748 2018-11-25 21:33:34 You trying to tell me that people don’t normally eat their pancakes with cardboard and motor oil?
1749 2018-11-25 21:33:31 You realize that falling oil prices are a harbinger to an economic slowdown? 

That's rhetorical, btw.
1750 2018-11-25 21:33:30 I’m ok with raging dumpster fire just not raging oil fire
1751 2018-11-25 21:33:29 Oil embargo time
1752 2018-11-25 21:33:25 Why are we not trying harder to find a different energy source than oil? /:
1753 2018-11-25 21:33:18 The current mess is the world saying they don't want dirty tar oil.
In seven years it will be completely worthless, why would anyone invest?
Why do you think they sold the pipeline to the feds? Because it is a money maker?
1754 2018-11-25 21:33:15 Rick Santonum plays the oil company shill so well, it's a pity he's not up for an Emmy.
1755 2018-11-25 21:33:10 Another corporatist take over. Indebt the country to make make it kneel at the  corporate banks feet. Then lift the sanctions, raise the oil price and make it look like another miracle of the US empire.
1756 2018-11-25 21:33:08 Anyone in Chicagoland have a gram of oil or bud to sell? Just need something to get me through tomorrow when I reup.


1757 2018-11-25 21:32:57 Macron is efficient, FRANCE  has  the highest rate of foreign investments in europe in 2018 because of macron's reforms. Poeple on demonstration in paris have low income and protest vs fuel /oil price + others taxs but we have so much social help in france ..but never enough !

1761 2018-11-25 21:32:43 To add: Putin has become less popular recently. Oil prices have absolutely yanked in recent days & RU is preparing for as low as $35/barrel
1762 2018-11-25 21:32:41 Whenever someone mentions coconut oil I cringe.
1763 2018-11-25 21:32:23 Hi hope you are well. I successfully run a business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love an opportunity to prove science wrong. When can I provide my service? I would love to do a collaboration with you. Thank you
1764 2018-11-25 21:32:21 I'd send you mine buuuuut it's different every time I do it and I don't exactly measure things so it wouldn't really help! I do recommend adding roasted garlic and olive oil though. Maybe some Parmesan. 
1765 2018-11-25 21:32:20 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
1766 2018-11-25 21:32:16 Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't OPEC (who we are not a member of) have the biggest influence in the price of oil?
1767 2018-11-25 21:32:09 Amin
1768 2018-11-25 21:32:06 Only oil off tiny limp cheatos but yes it seems so.
1769 2018-11-25 21:31:54 I'm not lying about secret oil fields either!  I was lied to about non existent oil fields though.

Are you claiming I'm lying and being lied too?  Am I also lying about voting No to retain EU membership?  Or protect the fish yards?  Or HMRC jobs?

1771 2018-11-25 21:31:28 Did they RTO Relentless Resources Ltd to get listed or did they make a business plan shift recently from oil to cannabis?
1772 2018-11-25 21:31:27 When you say geo thermal for me it means that the temperature is high enough to drive a steam turbine to create electricity. If you lived about 20-30 meters from a typical Alberta heavy Oil or shallow gas well you might be able to get heat and hot tap water (40 years experience)
1773 2018-11-25 21:31:25 Aussie shares are set to start the week lower, following losses in oil, iron ore and equities in Europe and the US. The $AUD slipped. Oil prices fell to their lowest level in more than a year in NY's Friday session. $RZI #Monday #Australia #fintech #technology
1774 2018-11-25 21:31:24 So who would be paying scientist "big money"?  Sierra Club, Trout Unlimited, Green Peace,  I think not.  Though we do know that big oil has been paying "scientists" to confound the issue.

1776 2018-11-25 21:31:13 Trump is destroying the shale plays now. Low oil prices only benefit the middle east. He let Iran off the hook and cut a personal deal with Saudis. We should be investing in shale in USA, developing Alaska, Mexico, and Canada. No friends in the middle east. #2019shalelayoffs

1784 2018-11-25 21:30:28 The price is currently based on what the US is willing to pay for it. The price in the Asian market , presumably will be much higher. If it is urgent to get that oil to tidewater then build the pipeline to the border now then rail it to tidewater.

1791 2018-11-25 21:30:05 Thank you President Barack Obama @ThePresObama for setting the stage for falling oil prices by promoting renewable energy.

1793 2018-11-25 21:29:59 "prosperity"?  You are making money off this somehow?  You do realize that we get the bulk of our oil from Canada, right?  Around 40% of it.
1794 2018-11-25 21:29:47 يع يع  يع يع 
1795 2018-11-25 21:29:35 really depends on who gets involved and to what extent, imho...could impact oil more than equities
1796 2018-11-25 21:29:32 You taking credit for falling oil prices is funny. Even your base knows better.
1797 2018-11-25 21:29:31 Could be
1798 2018-11-25 21:29:25 I'm not the one lying about secret oil fields an that.

1802 2018-11-25 21:28:54 U.S. GHG Emissions Decline – Thanks to Natural Gas. JACOBS OCT. 18, 2018 - The EPA released its latest GHG report - emissions declined 2.6 percent in 2017 and by 12 percent since 2011. The data also shows that methane from oil and gas trends downward even as production soars
1803 2018-11-25 21:28:51 Socialism is worker control of the means of the production, not state controlled. What Venezuela has is state capitalism. State ran oil industry to benefit those in control of the state.
1804 2018-11-25 21:28:39 Despite all the money that’s come into the province from oil, and with little investment into social security or diversification of the economy, my beef is with Trudeau
1805 2018-11-25 21:28:38 Oil was down with Obama because demand was low due to a weak economy.
1806 2018-11-25 21:28:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

1819 2018-11-25 21:27:48 Oil prices are the highest they've been in 4 years at Thanksgiving, clown-president.

Further, I am paying more in taxes not less because I am a member of the middle class - not the financial elite that your tax plan actually helps.

Dude, you are a liar and a carnival act.
1820 2018-11-25 21:27:39 Time to make a stand for sure. So far its 1,000 + a day largely unseen crossing. This visual puts it all in perspective that is impossible to deny.
1821 2018-11-25 21:27:39 How about this analysis? "Saudi Arabia drops oil prices after President Trump dismisses report concluding MBS ordered murder of US resident journalist"

1823 2018-11-25 21:27:32 He has nothing to do with oil going  up  or down. Will he take credit if it goes up NO!!!! It still the price at most places.

1839 2018-11-25 21:26:37 Price drops have nothing to do with you idiot.. massive overstocks due to fake shortages are now forcing prices down in spite of big oil trying to keep costs over inflated for high profits.
1840 2018-11-25 21:26:37 Oil, phones, and other products may be getting a few pennies cheaper, but unless wages begin rising significantly the middle and lower class will forever be stuck under heel of the 1%, the same people who have been using the wiring class as cheap labor to make their billions.
1841 2018-11-25 21:26:36 Wow looks amazing! I struggle to find bread without added palm oil and soya flour so this is a great discovery.
1842 2018-11-25 21:26:25 WTH are you babbling about? Oil prices are higher than previous 2 years and trust me that is NOT like a tax cut. Try food shopping. Take away FOOD TAX.  
Stocks are tanking and you see sunshine and rainbows.
Stop Thanking yourself you sound CRAZY!
1843 2018-11-25 21:26:21 Good for u pal.

1851 2018-11-25 21:25:55 I live in Alberta. I watched Trudeau spend political capital buying us a pipeline, reinstating oil industry tax breaks that Harper got rid of, etc. while Albertans act like ungrateful twits. Trudeau has been a better friend than Harper ever was and we’re too stupid to see it.

1865 2018-11-25 21:24:47 When oil was over 100 before the collapse, many shale oil companies still had a difficult time generating FCF.  Russel Clarke has some interesting insight into shale as well.
1866 2018-11-25 21:24:39 Oil took a huge hit and prices fell, don’t credit for lower priced fuel.
1867 2018-11-25 21:24:36 actually some inflation is hidden, if you shop you can't help but notice smaller packages at the same price, less product for your money while things which can't be downsized are going up in price, as his buddies the Saudis cut oil production gas prices will be higher for Xmas

1874 2018-11-25 21:23:54 So now more oil can be burned, thus speeding up the rate of greenhouse gas emissions. “President T” is ensuring that the planet will be a dreadful place for his grandchildren.
1875 2018-11-25 21:23:50 Honduras has more natural resources than they know what to do with. Oil, gold, precious stones, incredible soil, rich oceans, fresh water. It's socialism that sucks. How by bringing here what isn't working there going to help?

1885 2018-11-25 21:22:52 Water will probably make it rust again eventually, maybe rub a little oil on it? Like baby oil?

1887 2018-11-25 21:22:45 Haba yaseer! Wallahi I'm serious. I'm really curious coz I'm confused at something
1888 2018-11-25 21:22:32 The people at 5-minute oil change tried to bamboozle me but I called my daddy 
1889 2018-11-25 21:22:31 so I'm looking into CBD oil (since it's legal here) and it uhhhhhhhhh would literally solve every issue I have right now
1890 2018-11-25 21:22:30 Oil and gas? Nasalies? What ARE you even on about? Do you have anything to back up your claims?
1891 2018-11-25 21:22:29 Got complimented on my skin for the first time in all my 3 decades of existence. 

Shoutout The Mrs for putting your boy on the black soap, Vitamin E & Jojoba Oil regimen.
1892 2018-11-25 21:22:25 If he’s been that way for more than a day or 2 you can give him just a teaspoon of mineral oil. Mix it in his food, never give to him directly by itself. It should take care of his problem. If not he might have a blockage or intestinal flip and would need to get to vet.
1893 2018-11-25 21:22:21 Norway isn't under threat from those commies. But you can still liberate them from something that you make up just to steal their oil.
1894 2018-11-25 21:22:21 The last time I was at Lucas Oil Stadium was for #RepTourIndy and it’s all coming back to me... 
1895 2018-11-25 21:22:21 Dont quote me but i think it is saudi oil that is good for bitumen..many other crudes aren't that heavy ?
1896 2018-11-25 21:22:19 What? You want more welfare for the dying tar oil industry? You are lucky you have gotten all that you have already.
And tee shirts with hanging trees is hardly something to be proud of.
1897 2018-11-25 21:22:16 My family is full of big people. My grandma (dad's mom) was over 6'. My dad, aunts and uncle are all also over 6' but also large framed. I inherited the frame without the height.
1898 2018-11-25 21:22:14 Barato tipo quanto? Os realmente bons tipo wella, joico custam uns 38-45 reais 270ml, dai tem um que eu gosto que é o silicon mix (de bambu ou organ oil), ele é gostoso, e a embalagem é de quase 500ml por 28 reais!

1904 2018-11-25 21:21:54 It stutters every time it goes over 3k RPM. We fixed it, though! Replace a Variable Valve Timing Solenoid for oil pressure. purring like a kitten!
1905 2018-11-25 21:21:42 Norway has done well investing its oil profits very true. On economic freedom Norway was 24th in the world in 2014. Venezuela is ranked 174. I have never heard any economist refer to Norway as a socialist economy,
1906 2018-11-25 21:21:40 You can not hold the Western provinces in subjugation with no voice! 150 yrs with no voice in Parliament? Look at the north of the country! 1 vote each? Eastern Canada importing billions of dollars imported oil! Even our oil refined shipped to and from American refineries
1907 2018-11-25 21:21:33 I hear coconut oil might help?

1912 2018-11-25 21:21:13 @jkenney I haven't heard any details from you about how you would balance the budget?  Depressed oil prices make it impossible to balance the budget without huge cuts, those cuts have to come from Health or Education. I don't think we have any surpluses there right now ?!?!
1913 2018-11-25 21:21:12 When prices were down to 2.25 a gallon for regular, during Obama’s tenure. I remember the President saying the he doesn’t control oil prices. We had a real president then.

You thanking yourself, what a loser.
1914 2018-11-25 21:21:02 I see you still have no understanding of how the oil thing works.
1915 2018-11-25 21:20:56 Marcha vendida x calumnistas , y chupa cabristas , sierra oil , cuñados , casa blanca , refineria en Texas , plataformas regaladas a ex presidentes duplicaron la deuda de mexico , no entiendo x q le quieren hacer el chile a herdez q los hace ..
1916 2018-11-25 21:20:56 No.. volume was 4.8 million. Multiply by the refined oil plus all taxes and landing cost consolidated then you'll get value..
1917 2018-11-25 21:20:49 I love the BBC Website. The malfunctioning Strictly Come Dancing scoreboard is much more important than reporting on the World's biggest Oil discovery.
1918 2018-11-25 21:20:46 Nuclear future? Depends how you view the numbers. All clean energy comes as electricity (and heat in the case of nuclear). That will have to replace all of today's energy from coal, oil and gas, about 50 - 100 times today's sun and wind. Is that a bright prospect? Not to me.
1919 2018-11-25 21:20:42 Close San Yisidro port to one lane vehicle traffic and no foot traffic period. Watch how quick Mexican government empties Tijuana of these carpetbagging border hoppers.
1920 2018-11-25 21:20:31 Christ almightY!  You are so ill!!  Oil prices are low because you broke the economy asshat.  Tax cut, MY ASS!  I am a small business owner, and so much worse off than I was before you... I cannot wait until you get indicted.... the death penalty is available for treason
1921 2018-11-25 21:20:25 Saudi Arabia supplied 9% of U.S. petroleum imports in 2017. So we are basically energy independent. We are now the world’s largest crude-oil producer. If the Saudis cut back production they could temp drive up prices, but U.S. companies, would fill gap & kill Saudi oil industry.
1922 2018-11-25 21:20:20 Or groundnut oil
1923 2018-11-25 21:20:18 Screw that. Take over, use USMC to wipe out Cartels and make the peaceful ones all US citizens. Keep the oil and tourist resorts.
1924 2018-11-25 21:20:17 His loser ancestors of million mixed lineages were profiteering by stealing our oil & resources.

1928 2018-11-25 21:19:57 Erm. Do you know why/how the global price of oil fluctuates?
1929 2018-11-25 21:19:46 The whole war is a battle between the Oil Empire and the Tesla Foundation
Between the big and the little
Between a colossus that operates outdated equipment that does not change.

1. Russian Federation has annexed Crimea

3. Started the war on Donbass, Ukraine

1931 2018-11-25 21:19:42 This one is bad... Try "Caprese" for some Italian inspired salad .. with fresh ingredients of course.. mozzarella, tomatoes and oregano.. topped with good Italian olive oil..
1932 2018-11-25 21:19:38 Farm fed country boys.
1933 2018-11-25 21:19:36 There is plenty of money for oil and gas subsides and none for green jobs because it's not about the money.
1934 2018-11-25 21:19:34 What about all the people who work for oil & gas companies?  I guess you’re just going to create high paying jobs for us?  Nobody ever thinks about the thousands of people who work in that industry while they’re trying to get rid of our jobs.
1935 2018-11-25 21:19:33 It work ba
1936 2018-11-25 21:19:31 Would luv to see some “build the pipe” and “I  Canadian oil” banners in the stands at the game.
1937 2018-11-25 21:19:30 You have a lot of nerve. How about the money you collected for the 911 victims. You paid off a lawsuit and had an oil painting done of yourself so you could hang it up in the lobby of one of your hotels.
1938 2018-11-25 21:19:26 منيييييييييييح 
1939 2018-11-25 21:19:26 What would your auto insurance rates be if the insurance also covered oil changes, tires, transmissions, brakes, etc?

And what would the cost of each of those balloon to if it was “covered?”
1940 2018-11-25 21:19:22 I’m so happy for you!!!
1941 2018-11-25 21:19:18 He didn't take PAC donations, but he did take gas and oil company donations (almost as much as Cruz, in fact) and Pharma donations. Because of that he is a tainted candidate who will never have the trust of most leftists.

1943 2018-11-25 21:19:11 Copious amounts of incense were used at Mass this morning.  For some reason, it’s clung to my son and this is the best he’s smelt since he had the chrism oil at his baptism. #HolyBaby   #ChristTheKing
1944 2018-11-25 21:19:09 The price of Brent Crude Oil has dropped dramatically over the last few weeks and the petrol stations have done nothing to pass this on to customers. Absolutely disgraceful.
1945 2018-11-25 21:19:07 What the oil market needs is steady pricing not #potus manipulation. His intrusion is hurting deep water exploration where the reserves have long life and consistent quality.
1946 2018-11-25 21:19:07 You’re^^ Lmao, And that’s good, I had coconut oil shampoo and conditioner. Never using them again
1947 2018-11-25 21:19:07 Hot oil is always an option.

1951 2018-11-25 21:18:56 You control the oil prices?
1952 2018-11-25 21:18:51 I voted NO.  I was lied to by people who claimed there was no oil left (among many, many other lies)
1953 2018-11-25 21:18:47 But you can absorb a $1 trillion war fighting in Iraq for oil...
1954 2018-11-25 21:18:40 Maybe you ought to pour the millions into nation building in Mexico like you do in the middle east! Violence in Mexico from the cartels no different from the middle east only difference NO OIL!

1965 2018-11-25 21:17:55 I thought I didn’t have any essential oils but I have half a bottle of Jojoba oil 
1966 2018-11-25 21:17:50 Maybe they will get the oil as a free 
1967 2018-11-25 21:17:47 The only thing I wanted this Black Friday was a good deal on a oil change smh Groupon did not come thru
1968 2018-11-25 21:17:35 You are crazy. Your administration just released a climate change report that said we are to the point of irreversible damage. We need clean energy sources not more oil and coal. Our children deserve better
1969 2018-11-25 21:17:24 What I need to do: work out, grocery shop, do laundry, clean apartment, do dishes, meal prep, oil treat hair, bring recycling to recycling center, prepare for week, budget holiday gifts, etc 

What I want to do: lie in bed half asleep eating chocolate and watching Netflix
1970 2018-11-25 21:17:22 I have so so so many acrylic, watercolor, and oil paints. I should really try them out some day. If anyone knows any good guides or videos on these subjects pls link them I need help thx
1971 2018-11-25 21:17:17 Why do you support a murderous prince? All of us who’ve served in uniform, all those who died...for what? The price of OIL! Our sacrifices, our love of country was sold for the price of Saudi oil. You’re a fake patriot!
1972 2018-11-25 21:17:16 How do you figure you have one bit of influence over the market price of crude oil?
1973 2018-11-25 21:17:16 This semester has got me absolutely chugging CBD oil

1975 2018-11-25 21:17:10 Thanks for responding. Is this a good time to buy oil futures?
1976 2018-11-25 21:17:07 Oil industry shills
1977 2018-11-25 21:17:05 okay my dudes we all know these next few weeks are gonna be rough but let’s GET THIS BREAD!!!! Work hard, get sleep, stay hydrated & well fed, slap some eucalyptus oil on your wrists, turn your oil diffuser on high, AND GET SHIT DONE!!!
1978 2018-11-25 21:16:58 This is sticky sticky sticky. I push it out into gel caps to swallow, you’ll see once it’s fully cooked, I’ve got oil stains covering my kitchen
1979 2018-11-25 21:16:53 Do you know would be a total kick?  45 mpg - ikr?? Forward thinking even and preparing for a future without oil
1980 2018-11-25 21:16:51 You talking about oil? Sorry mate, that cleaver is looking too good.
1981 2018-11-25 21:16:46 Let’s just keep buying their oil so they can buy military items from other countries. Let’s not support our own country by not building Energy East but still provide equalization to Quebec! What a f____ed up country!
1982 2018-11-25 21:16:43 @RachelNotley you say you are losing $100M per day due to 300K of stranded oil.  Temporarily offer $10 per bl to shut in prod.  Surely Ott and AB can fund $3M to save $100M.  Don't over complicate this....the answer is right in front of you.

1985 2018-11-25 21:16:37 Is that the bargain you made with the devil...we'll ignore the murder of Jamal khashoggi if you drop the price of oil?
1986 2018-11-25 21:16:34 I was high 3 different ways lastnight  edibles, oil, and blunts had my lil ass slumped 
1987 2018-11-25 21:16:15 I'm afraid you are WAY wrong.  You make the false assumption that Western financial markets are the ONLY markets on the planet.  Russia has a great deal of cooperation with China, Iran, and many other very financially viable countries.  Russia also has its OWN oil & resources.
1988 2018-11-25 21:16:14 When putting in the oven a good amount of oil for the batter to go in and it’s got to be real hot
1989 2018-11-25 21:16:10 Super easy! 5 teaspoons of sodium bicarbonate mixed with 3 tablespoons of coconut oil! Mix well and add an essence for perfum(maybe 3 drops) and done! Use a pea size of it on each armpit  if you sweat a lot (like me) you can add an extra tp of bicarbonate to the mix! 
1990 2018-11-25 21:16:07 Mi affi guh try bun midnight oil cause mi still nuh do nutten 
1991 2018-11-25 21:16:07 Somebody gonna watch this and put motor oil on their pancakes now.
1992 2018-11-25 21:16:06 I’d certainly pay a bit more for oil so an American resident isn’t dismembered, chopped into pieces and burned in acid.   But that’s just me
1993 2018-11-25 21:15:44 I'm quite sure oil producers all over the US would love to see $150 for a barrel of oil. So not America first?  Of course not; it's always tRump first.
1994 2018-11-25 21:15:37 No, hemp makes very good plastic. It was a scam by the oil industry to make hemp illegalbso it could make all the plastic.
1995 2018-11-25 21:15:36 So pathetic that you're trying to spin oil prices drop into a tax cut.
1996 2018-11-25 21:15:33 Here's the rest of the story, 
Saudi's are pumping oil as the US request to kill the per barrel price. That kindness cost Saudi's money, but also hurts the sponsored terrorism in Iran, and hurts Russia's power over Europe. 

Seems you are a bit blind your self
1997 2018-11-25 21:15:28 Climate change denying politicians and studies are funded by big oil companies. Exxon makes $1/4 trillion a year in revenue. Rick Santorum needs to stfu because he knows exactly who’s funding him and what he needs to say when denying the truth.
1998 2018-11-25 21:15:28 I give someone money for heating oil right now. If my house were in a sunnier setting, I would give some money to a solar panel company and less to the oil company. Why so resistant to using sustainable energy sources and materials?
1999 2018-11-25 21:15:13 1969'da Amerikalılara $20'a mal olan fuel oil'in bugünkü maliyeti $370'dır.

If you were alone this weekend, remember to breathe very deeply. If you’re poor or sick, or both, same.
2001 2018-11-25 21:15:11 Use anointing oil on them before you dispose 
2002 2018-11-25 21:15:08 I thought your headline last week read " oil prices largely controlled by 3 men?"
2003 2018-11-25 21:15:07 Idk why broke ppl get foreign cars smh can’t even keep up with the oil changes on them mfs
2004 2018-11-25 21:15:02 And think the money is in defending science instead of oil companies
2005 2018-11-25 21:14:56 If I told you you'd think I was overly obese. I weigh around 200 lbs. I started lifting in 8th grade, I weighed 180 by the time I graduated. I'd like to get back to that.

2009 2018-11-25 21:14:42 Better than Obama who raised the oil prices by 26 cents!
2010 2018-11-25 21:14:39 The end of Thanksgiving Break was spent at the office wiping down and sanitizing EVERY toy (down to the markers). The washing machine is running at home with costumes and puppets. We are now germ and finger oil free and ready to play again tomorrow!
2011 2018-11-25 21:14:35 might want to understand basic economics of commodities.  Oil dropped because we cut our usage.  Has nothing to do with you exonerating Saudi Arabia for a senseless crime.
2012 2018-11-25 21:14:31 Yes and no, if it were a nation that's not rich in oil; even the America we knew would let it happen like the genocide in 1992 in Rwanda.  

That doesn't make it right, of course.
2013 2018-11-25 21:14:28 Russian Stooge, you has NOTHING to do with falling oil prices, as anyone with half a brain knows. Looking forward to your criminal foundation being torn apart, with arrests!! @VP @GOP @RudyGiuliani @MattWhitaker46
2014 2018-11-25 21:14:27 Actually, this is what Bashar has been hoping for. Damascus only wants the oil fields and Erdogan is happy to give.

2016 2018-11-25 21:14:13 هيدي اني عالشمال مع الغالي ابن الغالي
2017 2018-11-25 21:14:12 Oil prices are down because the market is faltering. It's not down because of the Saudis. Stocks are over priced and people are afraid of trade war. The farmers already have been hit. Starting January we're gonna all feel the effects of the trade war.
2018 2018-11-25 21:14:06 @PutinRF_Eng stop the vegetables, fish and fruits, minerals and oil etc leaving the continent.
2019 2018-11-25 21:13:55 The way I see it, it takes the carbon that would have gone into the atmosphere and turns it into plastics that we’d otherwise have to make by digging up oil. It’s industrial carbon sequestration.
2020 2018-11-25 21:13:55 We don't drink pure olive oil. We dilute it with vinegar.
2021 2018-11-25 21:13:38 So you are saying OPEC and oil nations first instead of America first? If we bow to them, they own us. What does your America stand for? Define American values.
2022 2018-11-25 21:13:35 I put Christmas decorations up and my apartment has Christmas Spirit essential oil being diffused and my “mistletoe” scented wax warmer is on and Christmas music is playing and I have a big giant Christmas sweater on and i brought my Santa hat out and man I am CHRISTMASY TODAY.
2023 2018-11-25 21:13:28 Hey, Iran has a lot of oil right now! We could just buy that instead. 

Sounds like the Saudis select their targets well. Poorly done, tho.
2024 2018-11-25 21:13:28 I live with an Indian family and while the food smells delicious it is ALL oil and frying when they cook
2025 2018-11-25 21:13:13 Why is it that nearly all studies denying climate change and all politicians denying man made impact on climate change are funded by big oil companies? Exxon alone makes $1/4 trillion a year. You don’t think they have an agenda to promote fossil fuels?
2026 2018-11-25 21:13:10 mmhmm., olive oil
2027 2018-11-25 21:13:04 
2028 2018-11-25 21:12:52 Oil consumption is peaking in developed nations but not in developing countries
2029 2018-11-25 21:12:50 Oil prices, despite their recent decline, are still actually higher than they were the day you took office.  They went up for two straight years (Thanks President T.) before finally coming back down in the last coupe of weeks! More fake news!
2030 2018-11-25 21:12:49 I just fucking spilt lemongrass oil on my bedsheets. Fuck me
2031 2018-11-25 21:12:38 4) Trump in serious trouble in US
5) Brexit / EU disharmony
6) Inflating oil price?
2032 2018-11-25 21:12:35 Most of the kids in my son's senior class are 6' or over. 5'8" is considered average but That has to be wrong. My oldest son is 6'4" and my middle son is 6' 2". People are getting taller on average.
2033 2018-11-25 21:12:25 All those people in the oil industry who blindly voted for @realDonaldTrump must be thrilled at all this winning...
2034 2018-11-25 21:12:23 He had a permanent resident carx for the US. Which is the next to last step to becoming a US citizen. Yes, it is our business. He traded a man's life for oil.
2035 2018-11-25 21:12:21 Thank Canada for selling oil to the US for $17 per barrel. Tell us again how Canada takes advantage of the US.
2036 2018-11-25 21:12:16 Now stop being bitter. Oil money and city is on top of the food chain. You've enjoyed your glory days
2037 2018-11-25 21:12:14 All the happiest people I know do weed or CBD oil .
2038 2018-11-25 21:12:06 Three arches on the demolished castle, one on the oil painting
2039 2018-11-25 21:12:06 Headlight out need a oil change alignment and a tire
2040 2018-11-25 21:11:59 "and while it avoids policy recommendations" Yes, and why wouldn't it? So are we getting rid of cows or taxing "carbon", or maybe stopping the fight over oil in the mideast and going back to horse-drawn carriages.
2041 2018-11-25 21:11:58 كلامك بدل على ان يا  ابوكي بايع امك او يللي مرتبطه فيه انتي بايعك ولهيك عندك عقدة البيع والشراء .يا حرام شو انكم مرضى نفسيين
2042 2018-11-25 21:11:57 So has anyone calculated the cost of turning off the flow of oil?  Maybe that’s what it will finally take to get Ottawa off their asses. #albertaoil #oilandgas #transmountain
2043 2018-11-25 21:11:55 Wish someone would figure out a way to convert old tires into fuel oil for boilers or diesel trucks/locomotives. We waste way to much potential when they get sent to a dump!
2044 2018-11-25 21:11:53 Ummm- you can’t suck and blow!  Don’t take credit for low gas prices but complain about low oil prices.
2045 2018-11-25 21:11:41 a oil rig worker's life used to be famous, but that was before they met a hairdresser. plot twist: a film director is involved. featuring chrissy teigen and michael b. jordan.
2046 2018-11-25 21:11:36 You are having a laugh arn't you or just completely naive? Wales is utterly dependent on the Barnett formula and the government jobs like DVLA at Swansea. At least for now Scotland has oil and gas. Current polling for Plaid Cymru - 19%. Pull the other one - its got bells on ...
2047 2018-11-25 21:11:22 Thanks Obama. The only thing coming down are Trump's ratings. Trump has absolute zero control over oil prices. Other countries are just pumping more, including the US,
2048 2018-11-25 21:11:15 There is more value in leaving oil and gas behind and developing new, more efficiant tech
2049 2018-11-25 21:11:14 هيدا اني والله اني بالصورة
2050 2018-11-25 21:11:07 How low will oil go?
2051 2018-11-25 21:11:06 We not white we can wash and oil our shit everyday lbs. I would say oil it once maybe twice a week!
2052 2018-11-25 21:11:02 And the stock market has lost all gains for 2018, stocks on Black Friday as bad as back in 2010, Trump Tariffs will erase any gains from lower oil
prices. Tourism is way down because of this president.  
#StopTheBS #ClimateChangeIsReal
2053 2018-11-25 21:11:01 Anyone remember the pet rock? Alberta could do that  with dirty oil. Tar Sand in a box for xmas
2054 2018-11-25 21:11:00 You basically told Salman they can continue to kill without repercussions, and sucked his toes while calling him daddy. Good job, President T. At least oil prices are down.
2055 2018-11-25 21:10:57 i Love how the coconut oil has Daughter curls looking 
2056 2018-11-25 21:10:49 Well they don’t have any oil so....
2057 2018-11-25 21:10:47 اني احسان
2058 2018-11-25 21:10:43 I only use products from The Body Shop 
It’s all natural and they have so many different types of products for every types of skin 
So for you i think you should use the Tea Tree Oil line !!! But still ask someone from the shop for more info
2059 2018-11-25 21:10:43 Do you have a clue for how long you were out of the top division before you got this oil money? Fucking gloryhunters
2060 2018-11-25 21:10:35 I pray this Vitamin E Oil I bought works for my face.
2061 2018-11-25 21:10:30 Is oil at a bottom?
2062 2018-11-25 21:10:29 No one "hid" the oil.  They just lied to those who didn't know better.

Seems to me that you cannot read?
2063 2018-11-25 21:10:20 Oil prices only going down cuz it’s probably a deal trump made with Saudi Kingdom to not persue action for killing that journalist. Funny the timeline of all that
2064 2018-11-25 21:10:15 يعني مفروض نصور الهوية

2068 2018-11-25 21:09:59 @Ciiaraaaaaaaa my girls car need a oil change and a dent fixed on the passenger side fender and need a damn car wash 
2069 2018-11-25 21:09:55 Mine too! That motor oil took me out!! 
2070 2018-11-25 21:09:50 bio oil
2071 2018-11-25 21:09:43 1/ What hypocrisy Mr. Butts!! How much money has come into Canada from foreign sources to ensure that we don't get our oil to market & want to destroy our economy.  Wei-Hock Soon is not the only scientist who believes it's a racket; many, more do (most of the IPCC scientists)
2072 2018-11-25 21:09:41 We need to expand our imaginations and achieve greater things. We need to prosecute oil executives for crimes against humanity.
2073 2018-11-25 21:09:33 Not only have I ruined the world today as a boomer, now I'm part of the Texas produced too much oil crowd. Geez.
2074 2018-11-25 21:09:27 WHAT ISN'T WRONG IS THE QUESTION? brakes, the car is just loud as fuck for not reason (bro said it might be because i haven't gotten an oil change,),, so need an oil change lmao, tires are trash, right headlight is broken.
2075 2018-11-25 21:09:26 Or Maybe the fact that America has clearly lost its leadership with the UN, that Europe will have its own Army and China is buying Iranian oil cutting its American investment.
2076 2018-11-25 21:09:22 家事も中途半端、休養も中途半端で結局疲れもとれず家事も片付かず……辛い
2077 2018-11-25 21:09:20 Solid chicken oil sa may city mall hehe
2078 2018-11-25 21:09:17 You don’t control oil prices. Get real.
2079 2018-11-25 21:08:58 So far Saudi money & lower oil prices to make Texas oil profitable did defeat the so called "American Values, Way of Life and Principles", thanks to Donald Trump who sees nothing but short terms achievements and work for his personal interests
2080 2018-11-25 21:08:56 Putin must really be happy with low oil prices
2081 2018-11-25 21:08:54 Castor oil.
2082 2018-11-25 21:08:43 Oil will be going up soon.
Saudi Arabia has started cutting production.
2083 2018-11-25 21:08:43 You are a liar you eat my French onion soup and love it. Also, I salt the water then you add olive oil to the pasta prior to adding the sauce. Oil and water don’t mix, hello? Do you even know what Al Dente means?
2084 2018-11-25 21:08:40 1 shot. 1 goal. 1-0 Oilers.
2085 2018-11-25 21:08:39 I got my facial oil in my eye

Cerrar la frontera.
La gente necesita regresar a sus paises de origen
2088 2018-11-25 21:08:35 Canada supply 40% of US oil use, Saudi Arabia (home of the most ardent terrorists against America) supply only 11% ... But sure let's continue to celebrate the pollution the oil industry do, and let's keep a tight relatuonship with the worst Sharia Law country, because money
2089 2018-11-25 21:08:30 Reasons I sleep with lots of layers, blankies and cushions:

1. Extra snuggly.
2. My heating in my room doesn't work.
3. And I have the world's smallest oil heater to replace it. Just as shit.
4. The weight helps me control my anxiety and actually sleep.
5. Extra snuggly.
2090 2018-11-25 21:08:25 I'm walking around gracing nostrils today smelling like cocoa butter kisses and coconut oil today
2091 2018-11-25 21:08:10 I have a weekly dose of ‘Spiralina’ and COD liver oil
2092 2018-11-25 21:08:03 When I was a kid you could only get olive oil from a pharmacy as a way of clearing ear wax
2093 2018-11-25 21:07:55 ¨So, the product being sold must be real as-it-is-sold (albeit much more carefully styled, generally). The incidentals can be embellished.¨
I read that on the article, so basically these are legal. EX: You´re usually not selling pancakes with the syrup, so motor oil is fine.
2094 2018-11-25 21:07:52 I wish! Just delicious olive oil mayo.
2095 2018-11-25 21:07:37 Kenney did sweet fuck all when he was a minister in Harper's cabinet.  What did Harper and Kenney do to help Alberta in 2014 when oil prices collapsed? SFA.
Kenny is just full of bluster and bullshit.
2096 2018-11-25 21:07:36 Shouldn’t have short man complex. 5’9” isn’t very short.
2097 2018-11-25 21:07:31 This is why they switched to “climate change”. The best snake oil salesmen are always just ahead of the rubes.
2098 2018-11-25 21:07:31 For those who are going on with the "Nuno Out" shit. Why don't you go and boil your head in some very hot oil. So fucking disrespectful. Nuno won't always get right but he will come good. #WWFC 
2099 2018-11-25 21:07:27 Sorry murder cannot be defended by oil prices. Us educated folks can see right through your bullshit. The economy is slowing down and debt can only fund growth so much. Everything is going stagnant do to shortsighted Trump policies
2100 2018-11-25 21:07:27 Yo @tesconews i see your southern fried chicken wraps contain palm oil, that the same stuff that orangutans get killed for?  Not really sure of need for palm oil in a southern fried wrap?? Either way shant be buying again. Explain please?
2101 2018-11-25 21:07:27 $100B annual tax on oil companies (5) provides 10,000 EV tax credit for 10 million EV's annually. Payback time is here @KamalaHarris
@BernieSanders 

Exxon's latest tax rate: negative 6% (thats a refund)
2102 2018-11-25 21:07:26 I like to use olive oil and madras curry powder.
2103 2018-11-25 21:07:05 Of course maybe with lower oil prices we can forget about Mr Kashogi's murder. Is that the idea?
2104 2018-11-25 21:06:49 Its time for me to do a oil change
2105 2018-11-25 21:06:46 He’s so modest.  It’s heartwarming.  LOL (Who wants to tell him presidents don’t determine oil prices?)
2106 2018-11-25 21:06:41 Hey @Oreo as you support the destruction of forests that home #orangutans and tigers buy using palm oil grown where these forests once stood I've decided to never buy your products again ... #RETWEET if you care about wildlife!
2107 2018-11-25 21:06:39 These little oil pens be sneaking up on you 
2108 2018-11-25 21:06:38 40 minutes is an #EU if not world record for such an important issue , but then , it's been written by the #EU and #Theresa the APPEASER and her sidekick snake oil salesman slippery Oily Robbins.  Wake up sheeple ffs.
2109 2018-11-25 21:06:35 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
2110 2018-11-25 21:06:24 You should try the BC rockstar or Bubba Kush.  And the oils, would love to see some oil reviews...
2111 2018-11-25 21:06:10 I paid $16 for a hair oil. Am I crazy or being cheap
2112 2018-11-25 21:06:09 it oil depends where you come from
2113 2018-11-25 21:06:09 oil filter got a hole in it, cracked windshield, cracked side rear view mirror, one fucking headlight 
2114 2018-11-25 21:05:49 Sorry, I can't let Dem lies propagate.  Kennedy and LBJ allowed segregation to continue, Democrat majorities in Leg. The CRA 1964 was supported ~65% of Ds ~85% of Rs. Oil Crash was Hapless Carter, the 80 recession was due to 20% FFR & reaganomics countered damage ending recession

2116 2018-11-25 21:05:46 must be so fun to be neera tanden, spending each day just getting fucked up out of your gourd sun up to sundown and not even remembering that you've said that libyans should pay us for bombing them w oil, or losing a thousand seats and then getting less than half back is winning
2117 2018-11-25 21:05:30 Hey Big Oil: take your propaganda and get stuffed. #ExonBlew

2119 2018-11-25 21:05:12 And furthermore, if you want a greener economy, GET GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY. My goodness, you people rant and rave about big oil but who gives big oil subsidies, who regulates the market keeping big oil competition free? The government!
2120 2018-11-25 21:05:12 Ok but also stop buying their oil instead replace it with canadian oil sourced from Canadian provinces who resect human rights
2121 2018-11-25 21:05:07 They block the drain, yes (and how). But I never bother drying it - just oil it and twist it up in a bun while it’s still wet. I mean, it takes literally days to dry anyway. When it was shorter I always looked as though I’d been electrocuted - same if I take a hairdryer to it!
2122 2018-11-25 21:05:05 Really vs the oil and gas corporations that lobby and support campaigns like yours
2123 2018-11-25 21:05:03 Vitamin E oil sis, an essential
2124 2018-11-25 21:04:56 "I don't need oil/fossil fuels! I ride the bus and use the free WiFi at McDonalds."
2125 2018-11-25 21:04:51 Oil change, new tires, alignment 
2126 2018-11-25 21:04:49 You gave a American journalists life for lower oil prices? But there's a huge oil supply that says you're a liar. AGAIN!
2127 2018-11-25 21:04:44 Is oil wet ???
2128 2018-11-25 21:04:40 Question for car people/mechanically inclined. It’s time to change the oil in my truck but I can’t find my owners manual. Anyone know how to obtain consent from a 2014 Tacoma? Thanks in advance.
2129 2018-11-25 21:04:36 I couldn't attend this Mainland Block Party because am so tired, have been sleeping like palm oil since morning... 
Stress no good for body oh
2130 2018-11-25 21:04:31 WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY, HEATHER? I POWERLIFT YO! I'M SHORT BUT I CAN STILL DO MAN STUFF!
2131 2018-11-25 21:04:19 Yet another way to say it is a right wing NRA, Big Oil puppet, Ted Cruz, was more popular than Beto in rural areas.
2132 2018-11-25 21:04:11 And @RickSantorum shows he is also bought by Big Oil
2133 2018-11-25 21:04:08 Despite quiet markets on Friday due to the extended US holiday weekend we saw the USD gain some ground across the board with Oil off over 7% on the day and stocks closing lower. The highlight of the weekend was the EU/UK agreement on how to move forward after Brexit.
2134 2018-11-25 21:04:08 #StopRussianAgression
1. russian has annexed Crimea
2. Captured Ukrainian oil platforms in Black Sea
3. Started the war on Donbass, Ukraine
4. Shoot down MH17
5. Supports Bashar Assad regime
6. Now russia attacks Ukrainian ships in the sea of #Azov
2135 2018-11-25 21:04:04 This president is not honest with anything that would jeopardize his finances.  But yes he has a lot of money coming in from Saudi Arabia (he said it) plus the Saudis keep the oil prices low and he’s totally afraid to upset them.  Not a real leader
2136 2018-11-25 21:04:01 i need an oil change

2138 2018-11-25 21:03:51 Murphy's oil soap cleans EVERYTHING. I've removed coffee stains out of carpet with it and cleaned floors and wood items.

White vinegar and lemon cleans all the other stuff.

A cup of water and lemon juice in the microwave set for two minutes, it steams and loosens everything.
2139 2018-11-25 21:03:43 So we should follow his logic and see if the oil and gas companies drive him to say these things.

Turns out, shocker, he's paid to say that!

2142 2018-11-25 21:03:37 Sure, all you have to do is hide a murder and then you get lower oil prices, hummm makes sense right?
2143 2018-11-25 21:03:37 By Trump closing the border Americans can't get back in, food trucks can't cross,  gas & oil can't get in, everything is stopped. This is ludicrous. Another illegal act from Trump. I hope the Dems have started working on the articles of Impeachment.
2144 2018-11-25 21:03:35 I FEEL YOUR PAIN. I HAVE A RELATED CONDITION, ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS. HAVE YOU TRIED HEMP SEED MASSAGE OIL? IT HELPS.
2145 2018-11-25 21:03:33 Win Jan canola down A$0.99/t & EU rape down A$2.03. Crude oil at lowest price for 12 mths. Brazilian soybn crop seen as getting bigger as well. US soybn export sales close to expectation at OK levels.
2146 2018-11-25 21:03:21 No matter your level of Iman, you can be depressed, but the iman will guide you through depression.
2147 2018-11-25 21:03:18 Finally! Someone else notices. Russia has massive oil/gas reserves but does not profitably ship those products. Climate change may open northern routes, while destabilizing Russia’s rivals. Of course Russia would promote the GOP, who value their own wealth over American security.
2148 2018-11-25 21:03:13 Despite quiet markets on Friday due to the extended US holiday weekend we saw the USD gain some ground across the board with Oil off over 7% on the day and stocks closing lower. The highlight of the weekend was the EU/UK agreement on how to move forward after Brexit.

2151 2018-11-25 21:02:52 While the Illegitimate Administration may have had something to do with it,  this has been engineered by the Saudis and it is NOT good news for American oil producers.
2152 2018-11-25 21:02:50 If you live in Cape Town, to your health in kenilworth Centre sells CBD oil (same thing) 
2153 2018-11-25 21:02:36 But how will you manufacture the wind farm without coal. How many tons of coal are needed to produce all the steel needed and all the concrete needed for an average size wind farm? How much oil or oil by products will you need to keep each turbine running?

2157 2018-11-25 21:02:25 You can make oil just like I do then pull it into syringes, 10 on syringes equals 1 gram. I like my oil better than the whole plant, I use like 2 ounces top shelf and add live resin at the end to give a large yield. That’s my oil in pens
2158 2018-11-25 21:02:13 Theresa May is like an oil tanker stuck on full power with no rudder, if she is confident of what, we the people, think then give us the #FinalSay or condem herself and her party into political oblivion - we don’t much like dictators!

2160 2018-11-25 21:02:04 Ingredients: potatoes (probably), some kind of oil I think, could be petroleum, salt (probably an edible kind), some other traces of stuff that might be sticking to the used equipment.

2162 2018-11-25 21:01:22 So nice of you to recognize Trudeau for the low oil prices, but in Canada they call him Prime Minister, not President.
2163 2018-11-25 21:01:21 Nature is up against man unfortunately, mainly for financial gain. Same as pollution or the destruction of their habitats, for palm oil or something, for countries abroad use. Nice to see some things working to help nature but is it too late?
2164 2018-11-25 21:01:16 Every Seasoning, Every Oil.... a suh people did stay? I have hope for tomorrow
2165 2018-11-25 21:01:07 Oil prices are a reflection of supply and demand. Demand falls in a Potemkin village phony, propped up, debt ridden economy, prices follow.  I know it’s hard but did you get it?
2166 2018-11-25 21:01:04 Create a climate saving program you can implement without using gas, oil, or plastic then.
2167 2018-11-25 21:00:49 i use cocoa butter formula & or coconut oil. Also you cab put avocado on your face for 10 min and wash it out. than place the cocoa butter.
2168 2018-11-25 21:00:47 shoutout to all of the parents and guardians that shop in bulk at Costco for all of their family needs because my cart with a jug of Tide, a bottle of olive oil, and bulk toilet paper is nothing compared to two carts full of food and household supplies

2172 2018-11-25 21:00:25 Drivel

If you have full fiscal you have a 14.7bn deficit with all the oil and with all the whisky !
2173 2018-11-25 21:00:22 By which I mean BOTH more natural gas and more oil. 

This isn't about either one.
2174 2018-11-25 21:00:08 KEEP THE OIL PRICES DOWN
2175 2018-11-25 21:00:05 You find all kinds of shit at the very top of the linen closet, was looking for clipper oil to clean my clippers, found some deep wave irons, a new bottle of shampoo and the first aid kit... no clipper oil though 
2176 2018-11-25 21:00:04 Exactly, oil prices are based on World demand and supply, even if that supply isn’t shipped to the US.

2179 2018-11-25 20:59:48 Vitamin e oil
2180 2018-11-25 20:59:47 Oil prices down based on market supply and demand nothing to do with the Fed.
2181 2018-11-25 20:59:32 A person who follows a vegan diet produces the equivalent of 50% less carbon dioxide, uses 1/11th oil, 1/13th water, and 1/18th land compared to a meat-lover for their food.
2182 2018-11-25 20:59:19 The irony is
I rly hate the smell of oil (like burning away on a pan) but I live fried food


2183 2018-11-25 20:59:18 Typical #EU rimmer's response to the APPEASER betrayal plan, written by the #EU and #Theresa the APPEASER and her sidekick snake oil salesman slippery Oily Robbins.
2184 2018-11-25 20:59:06 So stand-up that oil prices are titties (thank you Shack T). Gravy that, which is dislike a hot rocks Tax Blow Job, to our give it a tug bad Blow Job rag. Deflation up (are you listening Fed)!
2185 2018-11-25 20:59:06 I never watch @MeetThePress with Chuck Toady any more and will not. He has to include someone like the clown he had on talking about climate change. One has to wonder how much she gets for lobbying from oil companies? They should be forced to divulge that information.
2186 2018-11-25 20:59:01 Certainly stop selling them weapons and maybe sanction their oil? Oh that's right he can't. the petrodollar is based on Saudi oil....
2187 2018-11-25 20:58:50 Today I learned how to manually change my oil, I’m a man
2188 2018-11-25 20:58:46 You have absolutely nothing to do with oil prices. Period.
2189 2018-11-25 20:58:45 I need all I can get. I'm whiter than a scottush shut in agoraphobic from Antarctica.
2190 2018-11-25 20:58:43 Did you find any oil?
2191 2018-11-25 20:58:41 We should definitely stop subsidizing oil companies, and beef farmers for that matter. Particularly given the latest @IPCC_CH report
2192 2018-11-25 20:58:40 The one with the most data wins. Seriously. Data ownership is the next world war. Data is more valuable than oil.
2193 2018-11-25 20:58:40 Not for my home state, where our economy and state budget is mostly supported by oil prices!
2194 2018-11-25 20:58:39 I think Mr. Butts had at least 160,000 reasons to only protest and block Canadian oil and pipeline construction.  Corrupt to his treasonous core! Should be tarred and feathered and run out of Ottawa. Exiled from the country he has betrayed! Butts = Judas! 
2195 2018-11-25 20:58:34 Make sure u have a good face powder to set it & itll help the oil
2196 2018-11-25 20:58:32 @MichelleRempel weird. Kenney is calling for government intervention in Alberta oil, while at the same time Michelle is saying industries that can’t transition in a changing economy are not the responsibility of the tax payer. Pick and choose your industries much?
2197 2018-11-25 20:58:29 I’m tryna go on a cruise w bae so I can lather in tanning oil and get black as hell, have my ass out and in my mans face in broad daylight, be tipsy the whole damn trip bc drunk me = extra freaky me & suck my mans dick on foreign islands. Oh. And go shopping.
2198 2018-11-25 20:58:15 I think this is a positive step because any publicity is better than none. It's got people talking. They care about the rainforest. Now they need to realise where all the grain to feed farm animals comes from. Many didn't know about Palm oil.
2199 2018-11-25 20:58:13 Remember when, just 2 short years ago, how down here in LA, oil under $100 a barrel was devastating to everyone? How can they even justify cheering for a low of $50 just because their Fuhrer declares it so?
2200 2018-11-25 20:58:06 The nra, wallstreet, oil and gas, chemical cos., big pharma, private prisons, factory farms...just to name a few.
2201 2018-11-25 20:58:06 Why does it seem like my face has just been leaking oil lately
2202 2018-11-25 20:58:03 Haha kick them out of swift how does the EU then pay for its gas and oil.
2203 2018-11-25 20:57:48 In 2014 US produced their largest output ever but cut back w/ oil $ decline. Oil $ went up this year & US just became worlds largest producer. Those prices drove the increased fuel prices this year. Lower prices are normal in fall, as stations switch to a cheaper winter blend.

2206 2018-11-25 20:57:41 One thing that always pops into my head when adventurous earth-based architecture is dismissed is, "Have you seen the space program"? Multiply this feeling when considering the resources and ambition placed on aircraft carriers, oil rigs etc.
2207 2018-11-25 20:57:35 Also used coconut oil to remove my makeup last night and my skin was GLOWING this morning wow
2208 2018-11-25 20:57:32 It was lovely to meet you in ANGOULEME. I hope you and the walnut oil have arrived safely :) hope to see you soon. Cecile Vidal from La Noyeraie des Borderies
2209 2018-11-25 20:57:31 I just love castor oil
2210 2018-11-25 20:57:17 Oil spikes and that helps a desperately struggling Russian economy.  Is oil not the pivot between @realDonaldTrump allegiance to Saudi or Putin?
2211 2018-11-25 20:57:10 we are subsidizing our future with
cheap oil

your question really is:
"do I want to live past 2030?"
I do

apparently you don't?
2212 2018-11-25 20:57:05 I use aloe, tonic water and vitamin E oil after washing my face and it helps! I also exfoliate that area every few days
2213 2018-11-25 20:57:04 Unfortunately current drop in oil prices will crystalise the same old issues. Crisis 2.0 loading.

But the human capital situation.....kids dying from a lack of hand washing?! Yes things are bad but this bad? Nigeria is at the level of conflict states like Yemen and South Sudan!
2214 2018-11-25 20:57:03 My understanding is that the oil and gas industry gets over $3 billion in government subsidies/ tax cuts as well the feds bought a pipeline for ?$4 billion.  I understand the industry is in trouble at this time, but it has been supported.  Please explain your comment.

2217 2018-11-25 20:56:41 My brother kept saying that diesel is worse than gas/oil alas he's not fan of environment.
2218 2018-11-25 20:56:40 In 2016 I paid $1.499 per gal for oil. Today it is $2.629. It’s been going up since you took office dumbass. Gas prices.. again UP.
2219 2018-11-25 20:56:39 Spoken like a true democrat. By the way, Muslims (besides the chinese) treat their maids the most horrible. They are more uncivilized then the ones serving them. They just happen to have more money due to oil. Shame on you.
2220 2018-11-25 20:56:32 Beat  that little weasel! UCP already thinks they’ve won. C’mon Alberta prove you have compassion and critical thinking skills! Kenney is selling snake oil.

2226 2018-11-25 20:55:57 Nothing but bad news to report. All of the things that needed to happen to moderate the impacts of the oil addiction have been due long ago. Big oil knew long ago the impacts of what they do, and the public learns about it later...when it's too late. #MostHopeIsLost

2228 2018-11-25 20:55:46 Like the "T." Just can't refer to him as "President." Maybe "Snake Oil Salesman T."
2229 2018-11-25 20:55:45 As opposed to oil companies, who are driven by social conscience. Get your head out of your santorum pipe, Rick.

2236 2018-11-25 20:55:14 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Avocado is excellent for your hair. Stress can cause hair loss. Is it NISIM or NHB? supposed to stop hair loss. or similar? How do I discover the right url. Really miss it. My hair misses it.
2237 2018-11-25 20:55:11 The fact that i need 4 new tires, one of them is completely flat nd dry rotted, you cant go over 40 miles per hour wit a donut, i need a damn alignment, plus an oil change all inna same breath is finna kill me dawg
2238 2018-11-25 20:55:08 Not sure what that has to do with Khashoggi’s death and President Ts  focus on oil prices and $$$ in contracts from the Saudis.
2239 2018-11-25 20:55:03 Oil prices going down has nothing to do with @realDonaldTrump i guess supply and demand was a class he skipped at @Wharton  or maybe failed it because maybe he bought his way thru it like everything else he does
2240 2018-11-25 20:54:58 So, the tax cut you promised the middle class before the midterms is coming from the Saudis, and we should be grateful to you for not holding MBS responsible for the murder of an American resident?
OIL FOR BLOOD?

2244 2018-11-25 20:54:54 and those rich scientists would have gotten away with it too... if it weren't for that plucky band of oil company execs to expose them.
2245 2018-11-25 20:54:54 True, I actually didn't realize who I was replying to.  Didn't realize the Saudi oil minister was on Twitter.  Best of luck on the soon to be cut.  Ignore trump's oil ignorance. Low prices are no good for anyone
2246 2018-11-25 20:54:49 Allah ya masa rahma
2247 2018-11-25 20:54:39 I don't think "lower oil prices" sounds anything like" tax cut". The tax cut that was promised will not be ignored or forgotten. A tax cut with lower oil prices, is what we were promised. Until then its nothing more than a shell game,

2251 2018-11-25 20:54:03 Bullshit. The scientists aren't driven by the money. How many wealthy scientists do you know???

It's the politicians that are driven by the money. The dark money the Koch Brothers & their Big Oil buds give from the Heritage Foundation, the American Petroleum Institute, etc.
2252 2018-11-25 20:54:00 @Flora can you verify if your buyer users sustainable palm oil?
2253 2018-11-25 20:53:56 Current oil price unsustainable for OPEC and particularly KSA. Permian oil producers do not make any money either with the price differential. OPEC production cut inevitable.
2254 2018-11-25 20:53:53 I say we make them A-rabs part of nafta and take that oil money too. That’ll buy neck rolls for every linebacker, the way it should be!
2255 2018-11-25 20:53:51 Oil pens are dangerous in my hands lol
2256 2018-11-25 20:53:49 Well when your 'good neighbours' have syphoned off £bn's of Scottish Oil and lied about it in the process and suppressed that info for 30 yrs and are are still doing it (Clair Ridge) and decimated Scottish fishing, ignored us on everything.... surprised??
2257 2018-11-25 20:53:43 Sorry if the Liberals had one ounce of integrity the oil pipelines would have been pumping oil.
2258 2018-11-25 20:53:40 #StopRussianAgression  1. Russian Federation has annexed Crimea 2. Captured Ukrainian oil platforms in Black Sea 3. Started the war on Donbass, Ukraine 4. Shoot down MH17 5. Supports Bashar Assad regime 6. Now Russia attacks Ukrainian ships in the sea of #Azov
2259 2018-11-25 20:53:34 Russia fires upon and seized Ukrainian navy ships near the coast of Crimea, who Russian annexed into its own nation (aka took over) fuck Putin. Trump ain’t gonna say anything...watch, Russia will try to annex Alaska next...oil ya know.
2260 2018-11-25 20:53:32 Why should any beef farmer or oil company get taxpayer funding? If people don’t want to pay true market value for those goods, is it our responsibility to bail them out?
2261 2018-11-25 20:53:14 That's some twisted logic. As for oil, it's extraction price has almost halved in price since 2014...
2262 2018-11-25 20:53:13 Motor oil will never taste the same, sigh.
2263 2018-11-25 20:53:06 can anyone assist on where to get quality cannabis oil from? For medicinal use ofcourse.
2264 2018-11-25 20:53:06 Very sorry :(  Prayers !  Frankincense Essential Oil... and possibly ketogenic diet and look towards those who understand the potency of cannabis oil
2265 2018-11-25 20:53:02 According to oil industry experts, the lower prices won't last long, so we should enjoy them while we can. Thanks mr. t? No, I don't thinks so. 
When you thank someone it's because they actually did something or contributed to something. You did nothing and contributed nothing.
2266 2018-11-25 20:52:57 Expensive Canadian oil? Was that a typo? As you’re well aware, oil demand continues to grow and is forecast to continue growing for quite some time.  Let’s not sacrifice our prosperity to no effect and to the benefit of producers elsewhere.
2267 2018-11-25 20:52:55 They should be grateful to fracking, especially in ND. Trump had nothing to do with it.  They created an oil glut during Obama’s Presidency that also drove gas prices even lower:”.
2268 2018-11-25 20:52:51 Oil prices were lower in 2015&2016duuuuuuuuh
2269 2018-11-25 20:52:49 coconut oil! my son had severe diaper rash and nothing was working so I tried coconut oil and it cleared up in just 2 days
2270 2018-11-25 20:52:49 It's probably not very good for me but an apartment smelling of fresh oil paint feels like life. Cadmium, mmm.
2271 2018-11-25 20:52:47 But you have to remember what will happen to the oil and gas industry when the price falls and layoffs start
2272 2018-11-25 20:52:44 let me explain in English in French it will be hard it's a part of population who are against the fact life become more expensive (mostly about oil) and they are really violent wanna see some videos ? I mean it happens rn in our country

2275 2018-11-25 20:52:38 Ukraine has significant amounts of natural gas, but not much oil.

Russia has far more in untapped domestic supplies.
2276 2018-11-25 20:52:30 And I left my heated blanket on and now my coconut oil has melted into my freshly made bed. Today isn’t my day
2277 2018-11-25 20:52:19 And if you’re treating oil producers as can-do-nothing-wrong friends, then Canada should top the list as the top producer of oil for the US.
2278 2018-11-25 20:52:17 How about tax credits for oil companies?
2279 2018-11-25 20:52:17 If it was all about money you would think the oil and coal companies would be able to by some scientists too.
2280 2018-11-25 20:52:15 The industry has not changed one bit. I've seen "remediated" sites, I grew up on one, and have the high levels of heavy metals in my body to prove it.
260 billion is the estimate to clean up all of the oil industry mess. Which includes tailings ponds and abandoned wells.

2284 2018-11-25 20:51:49 If Alberta didn't bank everything on oil and gas (industries that are on the way out), it wouldn't be a problem. The world is going green, there's no stopping that. It has to, or there won't be a world left.

2286 2018-11-25 20:51:36 Oil prices falling?  Perhaps as a #thankyou for you denying the Saudi Prince is a murderous tyrant who risks our freedoms and chops up press members into bits?#nothanks
2287 2018-11-25 20:51:35 If things continue the way they are now? I think it can happen. Look at how he's disparaging Canada, although they supply 40% of our oil - much more than Saudi Arabia.

2291 2018-11-25 20:51:03 Yes, that’s true. The climate denying scientists ignore the facts, and muddy the waters for the massive oil lobby dollars they receive. The other 98% of climate scientists report the truth. God, I despise Santorum and the rest of the white, evangelical, for profit prophets!

2297 2018-11-25 20:50:39 Hi @Blackmores, I’ve heard that the Flaxseed used in your “organic” encapsulated oil product is grown in mainland China; which worries me, a lot. Given the woeful environmental pollution there, and the food safety concerns, what do you do to ensure the purity of your end product?
2298 2018-11-25 20:50:37 They don’t export their oil anymore?
2299 2018-11-25 20:50:36 Liberal govt are not interested in promoting Oil,  they pretend to be for it but with @JustinTrudeau he is just blowing dope smoke in the air.  He and his right hand person are for the environment
2300 2018-11-25 20:50:22 Yes yes, we’re warming up. Sentiment slowly beginning to change like an oil tanker turning around 
2301 2018-11-25 20:50:21 Expensive Canadian oil is not going to “offset” OPEC oil. It costs too much. The best solution to not give OPEC countries money, is to stop using oil.
2302 2018-11-25 20:50:13 Hope oil prices keeps falling
2303 2018-11-25 20:50:12 Win Jan canola down A$0.99/t & EU rape down A$2.03. Crude oil at lowest price for 12 mths. Brazilian soybn crop seen as getting bigger as well. US soybn export sales close to expectation at OK levels.
2304 2018-11-25 20:50:10 Can't remember where I read it, but apparently the oil industry hired Frank Luntz to figure out how to undermine efforts to save the planet. And the messaging that was most effective was to convince people scientists disagreed about global warming. Imagine that being your legacy.
2305 2018-11-25 20:50:09 Gee and I thought you were going to claim credit.
Bad mouthing it had no effect?

Please tell us you did not buy lower oil prices with an effective pardon of the Prince.
2306 2018-11-25 20:50:07 First time heading to Indy for the championship game, any tips of places to eat or do around Lucas Oil?
2307 2018-11-25 20:49:53 Wild Growth Oil stank but it works
2308 2018-11-25 20:49:53 Ya Allah forgive me for my utterances, Allah ka shigemana gaba kada kabarmu da dabaranmu
2309 2018-11-25 20:49:51 Right, considering what the white man did to the Indians, b4 and still today taking their sacred lands to drill for oil.
2310 2018-11-25 20:49:47 We need to put a halt on oil drilling.
2311 2018-11-25 20:49:39 This POTUS is NOT working for Americans -outside his billionaire donor class.  He works for his Foreign TaskMasters.  American Patriots support the U.S. & it’s Constitution.  We know a Snake Oil Salesman when we see one.
2312 2018-11-25 20:49:32 The dark ages were named so due to the religiously devout rebuking information brought about by science through empirical evidence. Ignorance seems to be primarily the overall theme of your day-to-day
2313 2018-11-25 20:49:31 Oil prices dropping huh? Under you, gas has been the highest price we’ve seen in a long time. Just paid $3.39/gallon. Is there anything you don’t lie about?
2314 2018-11-25 20:49:29 Just put some Lavender essential oil and Sandalwood essential oil in my essential oil diffuser so that I can a peaceful sleep
2315 2018-11-25 20:49:25 Have you ever seen "climate change" listed as the cause of death on a death certificate? Al Gore has got rich selling this snake oil. while paying not attention to his preaching  These word twisters need to go make pretzel. What happened to acid rain, global warming..........?
2316 2018-11-25 20:49:23 Cowashing was like the best thing ever thought of lol when my hair is really dry I’ll cowash and follow up with a protein treatment (once a month) and add oils to it, it works WONDERS!Have you tried adding tea tree or peppermint oil to a conditioner for your scalp?
2317 2018-11-25 20:49:18 Way to congratulate yourself for trading the life of a U.S. domiciled journalist at the hands of a Saudi Princeling in exchange for cheap oil and overpriced, gaudy, gold plated condos and houses glistening in Trailer Trash bordello decor.  How dare people call you a douche?

2319 2018-11-25 20:49:11 You must be freaking kidding me. You have done absolutely nothing to impact the price of crude oil. I assume you’ll take credit when the energy sector sags due to low crude prices and takes the rest of the economy with it.  Oh no, that will be the Democrats’ fault.
2320 2018-11-25 20:49:10 You are being sarcastic I assume - she doesn't know that there is a huge differential in what Canadian oil sells for, versus world price, as a result of insufficient market access.
2321 2018-11-25 20:49:08 @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau you say you are losing $100M per day due to 300K of stranded oil.  Temporarily offer $10 per bl to shut in prod.  Surely Ott and AB can fund $3M to save $100M.  Don't over complicate this....the answer is right in front of you. #OOTT #Canada

2325 2018-11-25 20:48:57 You’re dreaming. Oil production will need to be strictly controlled, but will not sunset completely for many years to come.
2326 2018-11-25 20:48:56 Is the market looking forward to redeterminations in Spring 2019?  Or is there another leg down should oil continue its trend lower?
2327 2018-11-25 20:48:51 How can the mainstream 'media', inside the U.S., insinuate, by their headlines, that a record drop in oil prices is a bad thing... when, only 2 months ago, they also declared that highest oil prices in years was 'bad'.   How can possibly be 'both'!  EOTP
2328 2018-11-25 20:48:46 CBD oil helps so much with anxiety. Real CBD!
2329 2018-11-25 20:48:45 Inflation down, tax cuts, biggest tax revenue with tax cuts, low oil prices. Just stop trying. Enjoy the economy!
2330 2018-11-25 20:48:45 I had a feeling you had no knowledge of Rosneft quid pro quo oil deal. One can usually tell who the ignorant posters are when those posters have no knowledge of Rosneft oil deal and how it was intended to line Trump and his crime family’s pockets...esp Kushner w/ 666 property!
2331 2018-11-25 20:48:43 Canada supplies 40% of our oil

Saudi Arabia supplies 11% of our oil.

Trump basically gives the Saudis a free pass for murder because of "oil"

Meanwhile Trump attacks and implements tariffs on Canada.

Anyone see the hypocrisy? 

If you don't you are blind!

2333 2018-11-25 20:48:37 Famous crude oil analysts saying that shake doesn't hedge all its output.

However, only 5% of global oil output is sold at spot price.
2334 2018-11-25 20:48:36 Work last night was so hectic. First I got smacked in the head by the dicer and then I had the oil from fryers burn my eye 
2335 2018-11-25 20:48:23 Tomorrow I’m going to start adding to my morning routine Lions mane and Creatine, this while I’m fasting and taking a bulletproof coffee ( butter & coconut oil) + 200mg of modafinil. The next week is arriving L-theanine. I’m also thinking on adding cordyceps and Octane Oil.
2336 2018-11-25 20:48:17 This Thanksgiving: 
- grandma aggressively tried to get me to do CBD oil
- uncle earnestly told mom that Big Foot is real
- went to a store in the mall that sells baby chicks and guns
- grandpa disappeared for ~3hrs?? 
- talked about the weather with Republican uncle A LOT
2337 2018-11-25 20:48:12 Dennis your “the squeaky wheel gets the oil” approach is not working.
2338 2018-11-25 20:48:06 That motor oil took me out...
2339 2018-11-25 20:48:06 Not to mention the dollar’s relative strength vs- price of oil (think about how that affects trade balances). 
MAGAs can message me if they need  a remedial economics lesson.
2340 2018-11-25 20:48:05 Do you know what it takes to attract  $90b worth of infrastructural investment to your country yearly? How much did Okonjo-Iweala, a World Bank MD attract in 4yrs when Nigeria's economy was doing 6% due to rooftop oil prices? Go and sit down

2342 2018-11-25 20:48:00 Thanks for the question, Rob. All of our Sno-Thro engines are filled with oil before leaving our Wisconsin assembly lines.

Thanks for considering Ariens in your purchase!
2343 2018-11-25 20:47:57 It took too much for the oil to be produce to be wasted. #dontwastetheoil

2345 2018-11-25 20:47:52 Oil prices are plummeting in the gulf yet Macron the chosen EU emperor  has put fuel up nearly 20%  welcome to globalism
2346 2018-11-25 20:47:50 I would love it if Canada was 100 percent self-sufficient using our own oil. The current plan requires expanding exports of heavy oil, which is expensive to upgrade and results in various by-products, most notable petcoke, which is now being restricted as fuel around the world.

2350 2018-11-25 20:47:14 40% of our imported oil from Canada, but we only import about 19% of our needs.
2351 2018-11-25 20:47:08 There is a glut of oil. We don't need to be producing so much and we can't afford to increase oil production as we can't afford even more climate change. We need renewable energy. If most of the rest of the world can use renewable energy we surely can.
2352 2018-11-25 20:46:56 Gave a presentation at a major oil and gas company this week.

2361 2018-11-25 20:46:21 Yeah the disrespect is immense lil shits need a beating and a spoon full of liver oil shoved down their gullet.
2362 2018-11-25 20:46:15 You believe your immoral support of MBL creates lower oil prices. You don’t account for the degradation of our standing in the world. Come on Mueller or 2020 whichever comes first!
2363 2018-11-25 20:46:07 It’s a great start, but not the only source of renewable energy available to us. Personally, I’ll benefit from increasing oil production. But I know that’s not what’s best for the future or the environment.
2364 2018-11-25 20:46:05 You WHOLE LIFE is based on LIES! @Rosie was right 12 years ago...you are a SNAKE OIL SALESMAN!!! RELEASE YOUR TAXES!!! Prove me wrong....I DARE you FAKE45!
2365 2018-11-25 20:46:03 Low oil prices will shut shale down or send them broke. Less supply, oil goes up = tax increase.
2366 2018-11-25 20:46:02 그래..머..하지모(넘...
2367 2018-11-25 20:45:52 It was always going to be this way.

Cars have been a basic commodity for decades and your average person still doesn't know how to change their oil.

People have to look up how to attach jumper cables on their phones.
2368 2018-11-25 20:45:51 @realDonaldTrump hey pal thanks for lower oil prices. What’s for dinner?
2369 2018-11-25 20:45:47 나 무교인데 그냥 불교할까?불교 넘 취향
2370 2018-11-25 20:45:47 oh please! I think the oil companies are driven by greed.
2371 2018-11-25 20:45:45 I hate getting an oil change 
2372 2018-11-25 20:45:40 Yes we all love them & get them mixed in with our tea every Sunday.  They are in Sunflower oil and are good for our coats & joints 
2373 2018-11-25 20:45:40 That or the fall in oil prices ?...
2374 2018-11-25 20:45:39 Da. I wonder which oil companies and defense contractors sponsor press the meat?
2375 2018-11-25 20:45:32 I really don’t think President Truman had anything to do with it which means he had as much affect on oil prices that you’ve had.
2376 2018-11-25 20:45:30 I'm all for EV. Musk did a disservice to it labeling it as luxury. This is a wet dream for oil.
2377 2018-11-25 20:45:30 COSMOPOLITAN: Put your essential oil  their snootch
2378 2018-11-25 20:45:29 Ed’s comments had to do w/oil prices, not US imports. While you are correct re: imports, Ed is correct that Saudis (who lead OPEC) has major impact on world price of oil.  This is why Trump recently called on OPEC (specifically, Saudi’s) to increase production when oil hit $70bbl
2379 2018-11-25 20:45:26 Ukraine doesn't have much oil. This is more about political authority than about energy or resources.
2380 2018-11-25 20:45:03 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2381 2018-11-25 20:45:01 CBD oil got me feeling like a sexual deviant
2382 2018-11-25 20:44:54 Ya it’s crazy, doesn’t even burn oil
2383 2018-11-25 20:44:54 Oil is down because we're teetering on a new recession.  Yes, it's thanks to you
2384 2018-11-25 20:44:54 The USA is the largest exporter of oil today. US oil producers CAN'T MAKE MONEY at $50/barrel. And, oh by the way - barrel prices don't hit gas pumps for ~60-90 days, so your bragging is, as usual, stupid, empty LIES.
2385 2018-11-25 20:44:47 Father. I know this sounds controversial. But cannabinoids from the cannabis plant can help with cancer. The rick simsons oil. I've seen many cases where it has work . Virginia is lenient on this. The right to try act too. There is no harm in trying.

2388 2018-11-25 20:44:30 This actually does make sense. If the price of oil is any measure, then Trumps plan is working. Gas prices in my area are significantly lower than 3 weeks ago, which is unusual for this time of year.
2389 2018-11-25 20:44:25 Why is #Canada even buying #Foreign #oil still?
2390 2018-11-25 20:44:19 oil is still very very expensive, over priced
2391 2018-11-25 20:44:15 I think ima stick yo vegetables oil instead of coconut. That bitch hit different
2392 2018-11-25 20:44:05 It's a horrible drug.. both to use ( increases suicidal thoughts) and to wean off. I'm grateful I had cannabis oil to help me or I never cd have done it.
2393 2018-11-25 20:44:03 It's not just OPEC. A very large part of Russian budget is dependant on higher oil prices. So, maybe start an international crisis to cause higher prices knowing Trump will take your side?  Hmmmm...
2394 2018-11-25 20:43:47 Use smart collection or perfume oil till you have money for the real deal. Being broke isnt enough reason to smell terrible. Do something. Use body spray,  roll on or even lime or baking powder for that armpit.
2395 2018-11-25 20:43:46 I just hope the Trumpster disease stays away enough from our election. Out in oil and farm country where I grew up there could be quite an infection there.
2396 2018-11-25 20:43:43 Fastest oil change...Take 5. Ok I've been here for 30 minutes haha not exactly what I call fast but they are super friendly!
2397 2018-11-25 20:43:40 We do have higher taxes on gas but the Washington State politicians don't set the gas prices. That privilege belongs to the USA & Brit oil companies. Thair just milking the big Fat American Consumers dry.
2398 2018-11-25 20:43:40 Oil or no oil ? 
2399 2018-11-25 20:43:39 I’m concerned - could you advise if that oil is “cold pressed olive oil”? 
Anything else I’m afraid is not as healthy
2400 2018-11-25 20:43:32 If climate scientists were in it for the money oil companies would have bought them all in the 80s.

Aún entra dinero por oro,oil etc.
2403 2018-11-25 20:43:15 Coconut oil, I haven't tried it but apparently it softens natural hair
2404 2018-11-25 20:43:14 My son has serious digestive issues, and he is going to be asking his doctor about CBD oil the next time he sees her.
2405 2018-11-25 20:43:00 Trump gave a pass to Saudis killing a journalist living & working in the US. Putin knows he’ll get a pass as well. Trump thinks the US public won’t care because they’re blinded by low oil prices and a bogus tax cut. It’s pathetic & sad Trump has probably made the right estimate.
2406 2018-11-25 20:42:57 You know what try 'Luster's tea tree oil or their jojoba grapeseed and castor oil'.They have the most amazing oils, brilliant. My hair does not get along with coconut oil
2407 2018-11-25 20:42:55 Hey, T ... if you're responsible for the oil prices, how 'bout getting the stock markets to go UP instead of in the tank, Pres T ...
2408 2018-11-25 20:42:54 Unless, of course, you work in the oil fields. JOBS falling along with OIL PRICES!
2409 2018-11-25 20:42:42 Midnight got her oil change 
2410 2018-11-25 20:42:40 I understood that the overproduction of oil brought the price of oil down. How did you take part in that??
2411 2018-11-25 20:42:40 Not really,  hes right about NATO, retarded about oil considering the amount of production in the USA, but goes about everything in a ridiculous way!
2412 2018-11-25 20:42:39 Unless there's a lot of variation among those, they're less sweet and more starchy. I like them diced and roasted or roasted whole. Boiled and smashed with olive oil and salt if I'm feeling low effort.
2413 2018-11-25 20:42:33 Do you know that you can like two tweets with two fingers at the same time and equally retweet two at once

2415 2018-11-25 20:42:16 And you wonder why Norway chose not to join the EU ... they chose to control their own fishing and oil rights .. and most other things , and are more than happy with the status Quo
2416 2018-11-25 20:42:05 We are also, now, the largest energy producer, our oil and gas, man, its now a monster.
2417 2018-11-25 20:42:02 1. Russian Federation has annexed Crimea

2419 2018-11-25 20:41:54 For soft silky hair, massage strands with coconut oil 2-3 times a week!
2420 2018-11-25 20:41:53 Did you know that a giraffe flexes it's neck muscles only when lowering their heads? A large, strong ligament  (tendon?) Kerps their neck and head upright as the relaxed position.
2421 2018-11-25 20:41:53 In fact, there may be evidence to the contrary.
As for oil, we can get our oil elsewhere. We actually still have plenty left, as does Canada. And then there's Venezuela and others. And dare I mention nuclear and "clean air" solutions?
2422 2018-11-25 20:41:50 A new one.. "Nancy Pelosi is the most progressive...".. While this claim was really in comparison to her challengers, I reject it on account that "Nancy Pelosi" and the term "progressive" should never exist in the same sentence. They're like oil & water - they don't mix.
2423 2018-11-25 20:41:48 And where’s it got us?

A £5m donkey and a £300k striker who is L1 level if we are honest.

I cannot stand Ashton I give you. He’s a snake oil salesman. I like Johnson as a guy and appreciate he’s trying but honestly I think he’s miles out of his depth.
2424 2018-11-25 20:41:46 We did some sciency things earlier. This is a oil/water/food dye lava lamp thingy. It was really pretty. Twitter takes away about 50% of the quality though, very annoying.
2425 2018-11-25 20:41:41 With a belly full of cancer, sugar and fat that has the equivalent nutritional value of a ball of saran wrap dipped in crude oil.
2426 2018-11-25 20:41:36 Except world oil prices don’t work that way and trump literally thanked the saudis a few days ago for reducing the price.  You can’t be self sufficient and thank the saudis (not that that was correct).  But thanks for playing.
2427 2018-11-25 20:41:36 Nice. Still, it won't always be able to be charged at home. But 90% isn't bad.
2428 2018-11-25 20:41:36 This has everything to do with economic war on Iran which is the most inefficient oil producer in the Middle East POTUS slapped major sanctions on them on Nov. 4th. They can’t sell their oil for USD now any remaining oil they could sell would be for very little profit mhhmmm
2429 2018-11-25 20:41:26 That Rick dude that came down from Canada into north Cali was right! I wouldn’t eat his oil back then as he cleaned it with kerosene ect
2430 2018-11-25 20:41:16 If "BIG OIL" want to drill off shore then they need to be held accountable for "ANY AND ALL" spills that take place. If a spill takes place they need to clean it up and be "FINED FOR IT EVERY DAY IT GOES ON"
2431 2018-11-25 20:41:14 What is Trump's target price on oil?
2432 2018-11-25 20:41:09 Плюсую к ретинолу, но может быть ещё зима и сухость воздуха, как следствия кожи. Я сейчас мажусь Bio Oil и оно прикольно разглаживает, но есть очень большое, но! Очень аккуратно наносить на лицо и делать аллегро-тест перед этим.
2433 2018-11-25 20:41:06 I feel you buddy! I’d b pissed too! I hope nothing ever happen to my car that’s why imma get my oil changes and e checks when they due!
2434 2018-11-25 20:41:00 Nah palm oil boy
2435 2018-11-25 20:40:40 Parce que le gas Oil  gèle . Mais il doit avoir un additif .... Sauf si un peu d'eau se trouve la !!!
2436 2018-11-25 20:40:35 There is no shortage of western oil and gas.
2437 2018-11-25 20:40:31 This is a test.
This is only a test:

Do you also believe all the scientists who have concluded that human life begins at fertilization?

Just checking, because I see a #science schism in the popular culture.

2443 2018-11-25 20:39:38 Senate did not approve it, buhari took it from excess crude oil account, it caused huge controversy, and everyone knows about it, it was all over the news, u'd know if you have TV in ur house
2444 2018-11-25 20:39:35 I wonder who's driven more by money, @RickSantorum, the scientists trying to determine what's happening to our planet, or the ones employed by Big Oil trying to ensure they make more profit. BTWs, Ricky, who's paying you for your opinion?
2445 2018-11-25 20:39:19 Finally got my oil changed lol #AdultingAndStuff
2446 2018-11-25 20:39:17 and oil prize would either remain the same, or further go down. I don't see an increase yet.

2449 2018-11-25 20:38:55 Bombardier has received $2.2 billion in direct investment in the last half century, $11 billion in corporate loans. It contributes to both the aerospace and defence industries. The oil industry receives $3.3 billion a year in tax breaks and direct subsidies. $94/ Cdn/year.

2451 2018-11-25 20:38:33 Wife has Alzheimer's and used CBD oil for months...no noticable improvement in either the Alzheimers or her anxiety.  God bless those who have seen improvement but is not the silver bullet.
2452 2018-11-25 20:38:28 The US can't afford to piss off the Saudis because they're propping up the Dollar, and our economy, by demanding all countries pay them for oil in Dollars.

2455 2018-11-25 20:38:21 I wish we were close enough that I could suggest that, because I have been hearing some good things about CBD oil. Unfortunately we're estranged for now, after my mom's death in February, which has sent my sister in a downward spiral.

2474 2018-11-25 20:36:55 They're nothing more than scam solicitors selling snake oil, it's time to start taxing them and requiring them to be licensed and bonded, that might put a few out of business
2475 2018-11-25 20:36:40 It’s like you don’t know how oil markets work...
2476 2018-11-25 20:36:30 To be fair, he got (via Pompeo) KSA to open the oil spigots in return for letting MBS off the hook on the Kashoggi murder. So in a twisted way, he does get credit for lower oil prices.
2477 2018-11-25 20:36:24 On the fact basis, trump lies so bad example to kids.  Trump literally took credit for oil prices dropping in recent tweet when he has done nothing to influence them, and while they are down from a few months ago they are overall up since he took office....factual example.
2478 2018-11-25 20:36:23 You are talling to someone who worked in the oil industry for 6 years. They only slow down pumping when the price goes too low.
2479 2018-11-25 20:36:22 *pouring some oil over my length and my fingers, smearing it over yours and around, never stopping to move my hand, moving between your legs, pulling your feet over my shoulders, kneading your balls before lightly pushing my dick against you*
2480 2018-11-25 20:36:18 Pétrole par contre veut dire unrefined oil.  Like an oil slick.
2481 2018-11-25 20:36:16 FALLING MY ASS, 2 cents more,  “YA LIAR”! WHAT, big tax cut? We only get 10% oil from Saudi but do get 40% from Canada... NO, not worth a death!!! No thank you scum ball! our economy is ready to fall due to you, oh that’s right you don’t read.
2482 2018-11-25 20:36:15 Tommy, come along with me and we will tour a bunch of remediate sites. Worked in oil and gas for ages. Stringent standards are enforced believe me. If you are talking about old abandoned sites....the industry eventually pays.

2485 2018-11-25 20:35:32 I called it after Texas election, this is going to be the Dems candidate. Texas was a dry run for popularity and campaign donations poured in from all over. Another young smooth talking snake oil salesman socialist.
2486 2018-11-25 20:35:31 Which is why it's disingenuous to reject any Exxon study as junk science funded by big oil, but treat every study that confirms the left wing agenda as the unquestionable conclusion of objective science.
2487 2018-11-25 20:35:28 I don't believe it you taking credit for gas prices falling because there's an excessive gas. That would be all right unless you own stock in the oil companies.
2488 2018-11-25 20:35:26 Seriously, where does oil really come from and what produces it?  I've always had an issue that it came from dinosaurs. Just not seeing that theory. Did most of the dinosaurs die in the Mid East yet T. rex was found in Badlands?
2489 2018-11-25 20:35:20 Q D.  I will do something when I get an A or B of support.   

It is not sustainable anyway.  Sooner we will be spending more on natural disasters than what they get from oil and carbon.

2494 2018-11-25 20:35:09 Heat OVEN, oven.  No need to heat tray or oil (...ran out of word space)
2495 2018-11-25 20:35:05 but for $60, seems reasonable for a dump/refill, depending on oil quality
2496 2018-11-25 20:35:04 canada doesn't control opec's prices. we can leave that out of equation since that trade won't be compromise by politics. Overall; saudi has the power to drop or raise oil prices.

2498 2018-11-25 20:34:44 I'm curious what "They are driven by the money" means. The climate denier pols get contributions from big oil which would mean that they are driven by the money but what money are the scientists who show support for climate change getting other than their salaries?
2499 2018-11-25 20:34:43 You are delusional. Thanks to tariffs cost of goods up. Gas compared to 2yrs ago when your crooked administration took office is up. Heating oil up.wages stagnant. No middle class relief. It's great Mulvaney,Mnuchin,DeVos got a pay increase too bad they can't spare a couple bill
2500 2018-11-25 20:34:42 They will pay the tax and hike up the price of oil and keep yanking it out of the ground and burning it for power and hike up the price of power. You are deluded to think that anything will slow down production of oil which just on it's own. In fact just pulling it out.
2501 2018-11-25 20:34:41 Agree, high potential for that. But watching oil also here as it can give an oversold bounce.

If you’re going to pat your narcissistic back for a DROP, off 
then
You have to take the BLAME for the INCREASE!
so
YOUR oil price in May, June & Oct reached the HIGHEST PRICE since 2014
AND  
2.7X$27.96 Feb 2016

The DROP
could not have happened
w/o YOUR INCREASE!
2508 2018-11-25 20:33:44 Thatcher pissed away most of the early oil revenues by reducing taxes mainly for the wealthy
2509 2018-11-25 20:33:42 I grew up in an area contaminated by imperial oil. In 1975 they closed their refinery and the land was developed into a subdivision. The soil contamination wasn't cleaned up until 2009. IO lied about the mess for nearly 30 years before they were finally forced to clean it up
2510 2018-11-25 20:33:37 I’m officially broke till I get next weeks paycheck with getting all new tires plus oil change to my car. But all worth it
2511 2018-11-25 20:33:34 It affects people in Ont as natural gas is the cheapest way to heat our homes & electricity is too expensive to heat homes, businesses, operate cars.  So price of gasoline has big affect here as well.  So we depend on a healthy western oil & gas industry.

2515 2018-11-25 20:33:26 I see no mango chutney nor evidence of fake truffle oil, so we know she has not been infected by too much @FoodNetwork watching. (I kid, @altonbrown is my hero.)

2516 2018-11-25 20:33:24 Sorry to disagree with you on this one, but I tried this in the past and cod liver oil gets rancid very easily... Also, in my book everything out of a bottle capsule etc I don't consider proper food.. There are no shortcuts here I'm afraid..........
2517 2018-11-25 20:33:15 Norway produces more Oil and Natural Gas... while the UK is Scotland’s best customer & has frictionless trade & freedom of movement with shared currency...

2521 2018-11-25 20:32:55 If we had only run out of oil 10 years ago as it was predicted during the carter administration
2522 2018-11-25 20:32:54 Major oil producers control oil price, that is just the logical thing. No need to point trump, salman & putin as if that is unique. Obama's laid back approach did not control oil prices. He removed oil ban to make economy look better. Know your background - not just dumb facts
2523 2018-11-25 20:32:53 getting access to the oil filter in modern day cars can be a challenge depending on the make and model, A simple dump/refill is a different story. My last car required that you take of the front right wheel, and removed the inner guard, or if you had a hoist and a specific tool

2534 2018-11-25 20:32:25 Might falling oil prices spur Putin to distract the Russian people away from further economic hardship?
2535 2018-11-25 20:32:21 I partly blame the culture of healing crystal bullshit and snake oil that is peddled as actual medicine, that for some reason is legal? Some folks should not have been allowed to use the internet. They only got dumber, and made other people dumber.
2536 2018-11-25 20:32:07 how  can  there  be  rising gas prices ,  when  oil  is  at  $13.00  per  barrel?
2537 2018-11-25 20:32:07 it will be counterproductive for Russian interests in Ukraine. Real aim was internal Russian  - Russian currency devalued, oil prices falling, pensions reform, Salisbury GRU gross fail - Putin needs smth to improve image
2538 2018-11-25 20:32:02 I am right in the middle of Vancouver (pop. ~600,000, Greater Vancouver 2 1/2 million), but we have lots of green spaces & I am a few minutes walk away from the ocean.

4. Shoot down MH17
5. Supports Bashar Assad regime
6. Now Russia attacks Ukrainian ships in the sea of #Azov
2557 2018-11-25 20:30:59 Perhaps someone who continues to insist that the oil industry is heavily subsidized can articulate what those dollar amounts are, where they go and who provides them. Instead of parroting the rhetoric. Facts matter.
2558 2018-11-25 20:30:53 "Baby Oil" Spray the current wall with Baby Oil no one will climb it. Concentrate troops and energy in other locations.
2559 2018-11-25 20:30:51 Blood for oil, what great American values President Trump holds!
2560 2018-11-25 20:30:50 THAT IS THE REASON, WHY THE CONSERVATIVES-REPUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING FOR COIL/OIL!
2561 2018-11-25 20:30:48 That’s what happens when you elect the wrong party to power.  The NDP want Oil & Gas left in the ground as does Trudeau.
2562 2018-11-25 20:30:41 Lemme oil my gun well so I can start shooting my shot here
2563 2018-11-25 20:30:40 And oil companies are driven by what? 
2564 2018-11-25 20:30:33 Gold and silver, of course if Scotland is with England your silver might not have happen, and the years of giving, on the gifting of Saudi Arabia I do not know if they want do gold for oil they have abundance think of it as your Economy based on solely oil the economy was sure

This is an invasion.

2577 2018-11-25 20:29:43 Khune need to accept that Pirates mean business, they are unbeatable, quality soccer and well oil machine. Chiefs need to buy players that can compete with the likes of Shonga, Mlambo and Pule.
2578 2018-11-25 20:29:38 It would be a oil feeding frenzy
2579 2018-11-25 20:29:32 Perhaps they could point is at the millionaires and billionaires scientists who are getting so rich off man-made global warming.

Oh those poor, starving oil executives.
2580 2018-11-25 20:29:30 The world is a very dangerous place, and if Russia keeps oil prices low, Putin will get thanked!
2581 2018-11-25 20:29:27 TRUMP IS GUILTY OF ASSASSINATION???YES, TRUMP IS GUILTY OF MURDER; YES---IF SOMEONE PROFITS FROM A CRIME LIKE TRUMP WHO PROFITS FROM CHEAP OIL FROM MOTHER FUCKER SAUDU HOMOSEXUALS'SARABID WHO SENT NINETEEN TERRORISTS ON 9/11 TO EXTERMINATE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE-----TRUMP IS DEAD...
2582 2018-11-25 20:29:22 That's incredible.  And so funny as I've just inquired about oil painting classes here
2583 2018-11-25 20:29:16 We do not need anyone’s oil, we need to move away from this very “Toxic” product, it is killing and polluting everything.

Hemp can replace oil, and can make all products that Petroleum can make...without the toxicity.
2584 2018-11-25 20:29:09 Nice oil change there Patterson
2585 2018-11-25 20:29:04 just applied my epic hair loss prevention oil and now im getting ready to get this grain B)
2586 2018-11-25 20:29:02 And big oil is driven by money to kill alternative energy sources.
2587 2018-11-25 20:28:54 Just like Education in Oklahoma is driven by oil companies? @MaryFallin
2588 2018-11-25 20:28:41 You're not alone. I got oil stains on my windbreaker rain jacket after winding it up into the wheels of an office chair.
2589 2018-11-25 20:28:38 i use the pomade and idk if it was because i had it for a long time and also mixed in tarte maracuja oil but it tasted like peanuts
2590 2018-11-25 20:28:38 Pretty Charly. It looks like an oil painting.
2591 2018-11-25 20:28:37 @realDonaldTrump  Lower oil prices are great news, but does that really mean inflation is down?
2592 2018-11-25 20:28:33 Shame Alberta couldn't accept the NEP.
In that case we wouldn't have needed Saudi oil.

But y'know, eastern bathtards freeze in the dark, etc.
2593 2018-11-25 20:28:26 I don’t. I just moisturize my hair and oil my scalp after washing and then put in my protective styling
2594 2018-11-25 20:28:18 What utter bullshit. Gas prices normally fall this time of the year as the cheaper to produce winter blend comes online, as well as a current glut of oil. You had nothing to do with it. More lies from you.
2595 2018-11-25 20:28:15 I would not be trying to take credit for falling oil prices since that only incriminates you on being part of the heinous murder by the Crown Prince and you condoning it meaning you support the crime. Not too bright are we?
2596 2018-11-25 20:28:13 Tea tree oil!
2597 2018-11-25 20:28:02 I wish black seed oil didn’t smell so so so bad
2598 2018-11-25 20:27:59 I will not thank you for lower oil prices. The cost to America was its president supporting the brutal torture, murder, & dismemberment of a human. Not worth the sacrifice & the loss of American values. mr #trumpybear you are truly an evil person. #WWJD
2599 2018-11-25 20:27:48 In the same way any member of the EU can veto any policy affecting member nations. Not sure how surrendering this power is taking back control but carry on selling the snake oil.
2600 2018-11-25 20:27:41 Is there a more annoying person to listen too, other than Trudeau?! I like how the NDP are shifting focus from the fact they haven’t done anything positive for Alberta Oil for the last three years.
2601 2018-11-25 20:27:34 well amd let’s not forget about putin’s inability to use funds responsibly and needs the oil there to maintain his idiotically lavish lifestyle.
2602 2018-11-25 20:27:34 You have no idea what you’re talking about. Saudi Arabia just cut back on their oil production. Prices are going to go up. Educate yourself
2603 2018-11-25 20:27:34 Golek gantie ojok diluar oil co loh yo, soale jiwamu nang kono hahaha
2604 2018-11-25 20:27:32 Tenet one oil
2605 2018-11-25 20:27:29 If it belongs to us why do we get such a low return on it? We have the lowest royalties and some of the highest subsidies in the world for oil & gas. The only thing we get is the clean-up costs. Those are currently pegged at $260 billion.
2606 2018-11-25 20:27:26 Yesss! Do it! 
2607 2018-11-25 20:27:16 lots of dolphins fans at lucas oil today this should be a good mf game
2608 2018-11-25 20:27:00 Watch out @FedEx - the oil people will now be coming after you 
2609 2018-11-25 20:26:45 Translation: Oil and Gas 
Are we really going to commit worldwide suicide to get every last penny out of the oil business?
2610 2018-11-25 20:26:44 @JERonFNC people need to realize the people in the Middle East Saudi Arabia Kuwait Iran and the rest of them they've been around a thousand years true they're stuck in the old ways it was America that showed him how to pump oil out of the group sorry is he key spot for the U.S.
2611 2018-11-25 20:26:43 Oil prices have fallen around the world, you know. That had nothing to do with you, so stop thanking yourself you clown.
2612 2018-11-25 20:26:42 Oil Prices coming down at the cost of our morals & huminity? Really? Is this what America has come down to? Dollar & cents at the cost of human life? Its a down right shame!
2613 2018-11-25 20:26:41 @MugShotUK I see your products contain palm oil, can I ask if you are part of any sustainability groups for palm oil or thinking of changing this ingredient in the future? Thx.
2614 2018-11-25 20:26:40 Sure. Thank you president treasonous. I’m sure we all love oil payed for with the blood of journalists.
2615 2018-11-25 20:26:37 That was Ukr economy.
both sides weak,
Putin has to flex, oil prices down
2616 2018-11-25 20:26:32 Bitcoin on right crude left.  Btc consolidated for a while before drop where as oil decided to blow hedge funds in 1 sweep lol
2617 2018-11-25 20:26:24 Except Assad said no to a gas pipeline going through Syria , then somehow he's a murdering dictator probably like the WMD there reportedly was in Iraq? Actually they just wanted the oil c
2618 2018-11-25 20:26:23 Yeah you need to infuse it with oil or butter first before you bake them man
2619 2018-11-25 20:26:23 I thought the same at first but i think this is too high stakes even for Putin for oil price specially with Trump etc.
2620 2018-11-25 20:26:23 Castor oil
2621 2018-11-25 20:26:17 Let me think. Who has the most to gain or lose? Big oil companies with their massive wealth and their incomes threatened? Or scientists and entrepreneurs with little money and not that much to gain, considering the distributed nature of clean energy? 
2622 2018-11-25 20:26:15 While using a oil based environmental destroying device go full Amish or stfu
2623 2018-11-25 20:26:14 Ah, but it will be profitable if Scotland separates because erm, whisky and oil, and erm, it’ll be the only way of avoiding the hard border with England, and erm, the SNP will explain it all later.
2624 2018-11-25 20:26:12 In India, seed oils are huge - especially Sunflower oil, thanks to relentless ads by brands such as Sundrop/Dhara/Gold Winner. Sesame or Gingelly oil is also used all over.
2625 2018-11-25 20:25:51 Brett once again the Canadian government isn’t buying oil - and yes I’ve already suggested an embargo on oil imports from all country’s except EU US & GB
2626 2018-11-25 20:25:49 the thing to know about cleaning is that fat lifts fat ---  fat molecules bind to each other - that's why soaps are fat - coconut oil or lard or petroleum products. Dawn soap - used to save animals after oil spills - is made from damn oil that is spilled!
2627 2018-11-25 20:25:28 Yikes. Not cheap for people heating with oil or driving long ways for work, making less now than in 1996. Strange how all the people I know fitting that description are female liberals working for conservative owned companies.
2628 2018-11-25 20:25:27 Kushaiwa cooking oil ndiyo nhamo here nhai akoma
2629 2018-11-25 20:25:23 Something about Sunday afternoon that is chill, like korma , pastries and a good bevearge of choice.Just the appetite.remember sugar to oil..........................
2630 2018-11-25 20:25:11 OMG?? DHSJFD UR SO BRAVE yeah same i was like here’s highly rendered graphite drawings and oil paintings of still lives
2631 2018-11-25 20:25:06 If this keeps up you will see the price of many goods rise. Mexico is the second highest (behind Canada) importer of oil to the us. Fruits and veggies, and workers into the So Cal areas.
2632 2018-11-25 20:25:05 Should we stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia and let them get weapons and steel from China and Russia
2633 2018-11-25 20:25:05 Scotland is only one of four european countries that is energy positive, massive Fishing grounds and Oil& Gas which the EU is desperate to geta veto by anyone is nonexistant.  Anyway Scotland could join EFTA and ban all fishing from its waters.
2634 2018-11-25 20:25:01 Millions of mexicans are waiting for him to drop that shoe. The mexican oil is mexican! That`s obvious!
2635 2018-11-25 20:24:59 You know I don't know if they told you oil was down today, did you know the standard for the dollar is oil so is she usually 9 tenths of a dollar, say if it's $50 a barrel I guess you could think of it like your dollars worth $0.50 like the Abraham Lincoln penny cost $0.02 to
2636 2018-11-25 20:24:59 No, it’s simple. All one needs to do is follow facts. Once learning the facts of the Rosneft oil deal quid pro quo re: sanctions relief that got Michael Flynn fired and incriminated (now cooperating w/ Mueller), it really isn’t hard to understand how Trump tried to sell us out!
2637 2018-11-25 20:24:50 @BorderBiscuits Do your biscuits contain palm oil? If so is it sustainably sourced?
2638 2018-11-25 20:24:25 Never believe the UK about Scots resources or oil, its a total stitch up, never listen to the conman from the WOOD group either
2639 2018-11-25 20:24:22 Who owns the oil?
2640 2018-11-25 20:24:17 Dude, just a couple of years ago left was apoplectic how panama papers exposed some friend of Putin. You forgot? They also published emails of Edrogan's son in law proving that Turkey bought oil from ISIS. You might want to check their publications before opening your mouth
2641 2018-11-25 20:24:17 #StopRussianAgression

1. Russian Federation has annexed Crimea
2. Captured Ukrainian oil platforms in Black Sea
3. Started the war on Donbass, Ukraine
4. Shoot down MH17
5. Supports Bashar Assad regime
6. Now Russia attacks Ukrainian ships in the sea of #Azov
2642 2018-11-25 20:24:17 No. Luntz set the stables on fire and blocked the doors with the horses still inside.

He wants forgiveness without showing remorse. He now wants to blame both sides when he helped one attack the other.

I ain't buying it. Frank has sold too much tainted snake oil.

#Resist
2643 2018-11-25 20:24:16 because they know how futile it would be to attempt getting legislation passed against the oil industry.
2644 2018-11-25 20:24:14 Is anyone concerned that Trump personally manipulated oil prices before the election. He admitted doing so in interview before holiday wknd. He asked Saudis to increase supply. The market did not adjust in time for elections, but prices have dropped, $20/barrel from a month ago.
2645 2018-11-25 20:24:12 Is that a barrel of oil!!
2646 2018-11-25 20:24:12 Study the supply chain of "Renewables" only to find they are as dependent upon OIL as are our cars, computers, electricity, roads, phones etc etc. "Renewables" like the oil they depend upon are TEMPORARY, they cannot replace energy density of oil as resource yet. In 2050 Maybe.
2647 2018-11-25 20:24:12 My daily breakfast of Special K topped with chia seeds and CBD oil exists outside the bounds of chronological health and wellness trends.
2648 2018-11-25 20:24:01 I've no drive to go anywhere and I don't want to be a pest to the lady who did take me. Omg I just did Jilly's ears with half n half olive oil and cider vinegar. Holy crap that vinegar stinks! She's none too pleased either. I'm a bad mommy.
2649 2018-11-25 20:24:00 We were talking magic underwear on skinny ass models... I think. Oh and Mormon mind control powers!
2650 2018-11-25 20:23:59 While the price of crude oil is at its lowest since Iraq invasions we are paying almost twice as much as we should be. Even though renewable energies are viable solutoons politicians are scamming us
2651 2018-11-25 20:23:59 —Chapped lips

•If you have are cracked and painful, crack open a vitamin E capsule and put a little bit of the gel on the problem areas.
•You can also put coconut or almond oil on your lips then let it sit for 10 minutes then gently wipe off
2652 2018-11-25 20:23:57 And Saudis are only 10% of oil in the u.s. anyway
2653 2018-11-25 20:23:53 It is an old old old myth that the Prezidant ha any control over oil prices. If inflation is down but the common income still hasn't changed, (or gone down), then that doesn't mean sh*t either
2654 2018-11-25 20:23:52 It’s parsley oil ... X
2655 2018-11-25 20:23:49 So we get rid of oil. What does the next day look like?
2656 2018-11-25 20:23:33 Oil
2657 2018-11-25 20:23:31 It's not as if the car is filled with flammable material. Carbon fibre, hydraulic oil, engine oil, ~100kg of fuel.

Nothing at all to worry about if the driver can't get out. He'll be fine.
2658 2018-11-25 20:23:28 Explain?? Germany imports its oil from Russia whilst asking America for protection from Russia. All the world leaders are scared of Putin and the biggest culprit was Obama.
2659 2018-11-25 20:23:21 Nice to know that you still think there is no oil in #ClairRidge. Sticking by your beliefs is admirable to some I am sure.
2660 2018-11-25 20:23:20 But don't mention Russia or the crown Prince. If Mexico had oil those ppl woulda been US citizens by now.
2661 2018-11-25 20:23:11 Let’s grant for argument’s sake that researchers are motivated by money. Do these people ever bother to point out that it’s a pittance compared to the money that motivates big oil and gas? No. They do not.
2662 2018-11-25 20:22:54 Oil industry engineered protests like Brexit ?
2663 2018-11-25 20:22:53 Wow, couldn’t time it better!! Global markets are in melt down....I know what we need, a war in the Black Sea!! That will bump oil prices back in the right direction before Christmas 
2664 2018-11-25 20:22:52 3 more dead journalists and oil will be at 15 dollars
2665 2018-11-25 20:22:52 Really? What exactly have you done to affect oil prices.  Oh my bad backed a murderer
2666 2018-11-25 20:22:38 What are you, 5? 
2667 2018-11-25 20:22:33 I thought the Saudis were responsible for the low price of oil?
2668 2018-11-25 20:22:25 What do you mean who are we? 
2669 2018-11-25 20:22:22 3. ... said TARGET was "chlorine gas mfr' building. That TOO was a IE b/c of how the building fell under the rocket attack.
Mr. @POTUS u have some reason 4 wanting to REMOVE #Assad (methinks OIL RELATED) but do NOT lie about him! He is NO WORSE than Crown Prince Bin Salman of SA.
2670 2018-11-25 20:22:19 omg...motor oil...
2671 2018-11-25 20:22:17 True. In the last few weeks, some companies have decided to curtail production here. Estimates are 100-120k bbl of oil has been taken offline.
2672 2018-11-25 20:22:15 Totally! If you make the roux with coconut oil it's waaaay better. You working on a recipe already or need one?
2673 2018-11-25 20:22:15 It is pretty evident that climate denial is driven by financial interests,
while there is literally no obvious financial gain in reporting climate change findings and conclusions. 

If money was the objective, “these scientists” would pursue oil & gas funding for bogus studies.
2674 2018-11-25 20:22:04 Blueberry Bliss leave in conditioner, peppermint oil, blueberry & coconut hair creme...My hair & scalp feel AHMAZING!!!
2675 2018-11-25 20:21:59 President T? So now you’re speaking in the 3rd person and trying to give yourself a cool nickname? 

Oil price reduction has nothing to do with you, a few cents less is nowhere near compatible to a tax cut, and you’re still the worst “president” in the history of America.
2676 2018-11-25 20:21:57 im probably going to get backlash for this but tbh there is a reason California has wildfires every year

They have a plant there that sweats flammable oil
2677 2018-11-25 20:21:56 Stop Dealing With Murderers for Oil.
2678 2018-11-25 20:21:55 No that’s big oil and gas.
2679 2018-11-25 20:21:51 Put differently, it's flat out dishonest to suggest that loss mitigation is the answer.  It's the last thing to be done after youve done everything else.  In terms of solutions, it's snake oil.
2680 2018-11-25 20:21:46 @JustinTrudeau  What the hell has happened to you? You don't help the oil patch or Canada's self-sufficiency in energy. Alberta has funded Canada for decades but no help for them. Now major tax breaks for the news media. You are spending taxpayers money like Trump. Pathetic!!!!
2681 2018-11-25 20:21:31 drinking the oil from peanut butter and becoming insanely powerful while I scrub discharge stains from my undies in the garage
2682 2018-11-25 20:21:29 oil absorbing sheets are my actual best friend omg
2683 2018-11-25 20:21:27 And the US is laughing all the way to the bank on our cheap oil.      M. Trudeau - you should be ashamed - in fact I'm ashamed you call yourself a Canadian because you certainly don't act like one
2684 2018-11-25 20:21:20 They are not falling because of you. Inflation is still around where it's been. Headline moves with oil fyi. But don't take credit for this when you have no hand in oil production. Can take credit for allowing waivers to import Iran oil. Thought you were taking a tough stance?
2685 2018-11-25 20:21:15 “So great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T),” Donald Trump tweeted Sunday morning, soliciting gratitude for his political agenda at the end of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. - those are not the words of a functioning person, much less a president. Come on.
2686 2018-11-25 20:21:14 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
2687 2018-11-25 20:21:12 Oil prices are down because you allowed Iran to sell oil after should said you would impose sanctions.
2688 2018-11-25 20:21:11 Yes I do.  I use the alkyd/waterborne hybrid as well.   I use allot of urethanes to.  Once while I use oil for Topcoat’s but not often.  I always prime with shellac . If I need to build the primer I’ll shellac then prime with waterborne or oil .
2689 2018-11-25 20:21:11 Grab the anointing oil, sis.
2690 2018-11-25 20:21:01 Don't flatter yourself!  Oil is a commodity that rises & falls (supply and demand). Your LIES DO NOT affect gas prices. Only a global oil embargo of the Saudis would do that. Fool.
2691 2018-11-25 20:20:57 It is idiotic for Canada to sell its oil at USD 16-. Either put it into storage or stop pumping.
2692 2018-11-25 20:20:55 The solution is not more oil it’s the opposite u are wasting resources and basically giving away oil to the damn Yankees -slow those pump jacks
2693 2018-11-25 20:20:50 Cheers. 
Apart from cycling and water management, the Netherlands is mostly about Banks, Bulbs, Beer and Oil.
2694 2018-11-25 20:20:45 That’s what happens when you tug a oil tanker and block under a bridge
2695 2018-11-25 20:20:45 Says the biggest snake oil salesmen since McCarthy
2696 2018-11-25 20:20:39 Let's be clear about something. If USA didn't export any oil, we could satisfy any need to import oil by the amount we bring in from Canada. We don't need middle east oil. Trump's brag about him controlling the price of gas is a lie. @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse
2697 2018-11-25 20:20:35 Hahahahah! That’s cute thou. I wouldn’t be mad at that.
2698 2018-11-25 20:20:24 I fail to see your point. Please elaborate. Also oil prices are crashing so don’t talk too quickly
2699 2018-11-25 20:20:23 you’re welcome! my check engine light goes on every ~5k miles when it’s time for an oil change so i hope its the same for u. good luck 
2700 2018-11-25 20:20:22 Isn't it very nice that we are on the same league with Russia, which is regarded more industrialized than us and has a vast array of natural resources, mines, oil etc? Do I sound like Pollyanna?
2701 2018-11-25 20:20:10 It's time for Indy regardless what England decides to do if this Brexit hasn't served Scots a lesson nothing will , the cats out of the bag also regarding oil bring it on !

2703 2018-11-25 20:20:06 does anyone w a camaro wanna race me I just got my oil changed lol
2704 2018-11-25 20:19:56 Great! But what about the domestic oil jobs that are going to be cut because of lower oil prices. Btw lower oil prices don’t necessarily transcribe to lower gas prices. To get lower gas prices you need more gas production. Ie more refineries.
2705 2018-11-25 20:19:55 can’t wait to get back and do yoga w my roommates n clean my room n turn on my essential oil diffuser in the name of relaxation and ignore doing anything that would actually solve what stresses me out
2706 2018-11-25 20:19:49 I used 1/2”x1/16” flat and 1/4” round both sourced from the big box stores. Make sure you use plenty of cutting oil when threading. Go slow, work about a turn or two and back off before cutting more.
2707 2018-11-25 20:19:47 the climate change folks who want to ban fossil fuels would all secretly smile at another oil embargo.

Lmao could NOT be me
2711 2018-11-25 20:19:33 Exactly and they all bend and twist things to fill their pockets. Bush had gas prices at nearly 5 dollars a gallon his family was built from oil
2712 2018-11-25 20:19:30 I’m a proponent of “smart government” not “big government”. B/c I don’t trust our current corporatocracy (icky buzzword) to let environmental best practices do their thing. Free market in its current status has big oil in control. Get lobbies out & then I’ll feel better.
2713 2018-11-25 20:19:28 Sunflower oil is used a lot! I think rice bran oil is also becoming popular a lot! I grew up on ghee and peanut oil.
2714 2018-11-25 20:19:27 Does anyone in the bay area have need of a real clunker of a car?  As in leaking oil, a shabby interior, and a probable advent calendar of unknown mechanical maladies?  A family member might be getting rid of one.
2715 2018-11-25 20:19:27 The purpose of the olive oil Ms 
Maybe that's where I'm going wrong

that child was @arabicerreala22
2718 2018-11-25 20:19:15 Concerned at how the skin on my palms won’t stop peeling off I literally put lotion on Always and use oil and everything
2719 2018-11-25 20:19:05 Is that President Traitor? You are not to be thanked for falling oil prices. You sold our soul to the Saudis when you didn’t believe the CIA, that’s one of your traitor moments. Stop tweeting. Why didn’t you visit our soldiers in Afghanistan or Iraq?

2721 2018-11-25 20:19:00 Not an oil crisis. Just a cash crisis. We can diversify and make cash sustainably instead of lamenting the death of this industry. These Luddites are getting tiresome. #innovatealberta #knowledgeeconomy

2724 2018-11-25 20:18:51 Ooo yeah he will 
I mean... what? Wait? What?
2725 2018-11-25 20:18:50 @elonmusk can we get a shoutout to Mr. Taleb who spent his Sunday destroying oil lovers and trolls?
2726 2018-11-25 20:18:47 I don't understand that argument. "I'm not the worst, therefore I should not do anything"? What do you suggest we do then? Waiting passively for laws to pass is not an acceptable option.
Also, you can have enough money to stop eating cows without owning a big oïl company?
2727 2018-11-25 20:18:46 remember when gas prices were high under Bush we were told presidents have little influence on gas prices as it's all supply and demand and currently there is a huge glut of oil but his buddies the Saudis have already started to cut production to fix that, higher prices for Xmas!

2729 2018-11-25 20:18:38 omg wow 10.4 billiom barrels of oil in ANWR!!!

Oh look, the USA consumes 7.28 billion a year.

So only extending our usage a year and a half.
2730 2018-11-25 20:18:38 Instead of buying a real Christmas tree, my sister set up a fake one and has her diffuser running with pine essential oil in it 
2731 2018-11-25 20:18:36 I don’t even know. He’s one of those guys that uses the 3-1 and one but has 50 different kinds of beard shampoo and condition, beard oil idk 
2732 2018-11-25 20:18:32 I agree with Ceci that if this was another sector, it would be all systems go to help. Makes you wonder if the Liberals really want an oil sector.
2733 2018-11-25 20:18:29 'Thank you President T': RZA gives himself a pat on the back for low oil prices
2734 2018-11-25 20:18:24 Except we do have control over climate and the environment.  The real people making billions are spilling oil in the oceans harming animal and human. Giving people cancer by putting toxins in water and the air.  They are killing people for profit that’s worse regardless.
2735 2018-11-25 20:18:23 Ah Chelsea before the oil !
2736 2018-11-25 20:18:17 
2737 2018-11-25 20:18:17 I don't see how oil can get anywhere near $40 with OPEC cutting right now. Most hedge funds have blown up already. Netlongs are near 0. The damage is already done to sentiment. The next $10 move is higher. $60 before $40 is about 90% chance I think.
2738 2018-11-25 20:18:02 A barrel of oil. Slippery slope.
2739 2018-11-25 20:17:58 It's got clove essential oil in it! Very similar scent to the Backbone bar -- it's made of some of the scraps of that batch plus the Genesis batch we kind of messed up!
2740 2018-11-25 20:17:58 Remember, Oil is the new Food. It can starve the nation. The earlier you use solar and wind and bio, the better the chance is to avoid a modern #Holodomor!
2741 2018-11-25 20:17:54 Do you really believe that the collapse of oil is just a "spite" to the Fed? Do you believe that it does not have much more important repercussions on the global economy? Is it really so short-sighted?
2742 2018-11-25 20:17:50 Does that include the oil

2748 2018-11-25 20:17:23 Add Quebec and the sewage dumping into the St Lawerance with the importing of dirty Saudi oil, they worry about the climate when it’s convenient for their message.
2749 2018-11-25 20:17:23 How about sharing with us how you directly caused oil prices to fall?
2750 2018-11-25 20:17:21 Google how much oil we get from the middle East.  I will wait.
2751 2018-11-25 20:17:18 That's nonsense. We import about the same amount of oil from Saudi as we did in 1983. No, it is the elites who have plenty of money in Saudi and partnering with Saudi who stand to lose. Average Americans stand to win.
2752 2018-11-25 20:17:16 Interesting oil news in Golan Heights may explain some of Trumps Admin foreign policy.  Follow the $$$.

2763 2018-11-25 20:16:13 Well once 'Clair Ridge' revenue starts to come home to Scotland just like Norway the Oil wealth fund (£150bn pa) will pay for everything but thanks for the concern.  Don't worry tho'we will give rUK a helping hand in exactly the samed way they have helped us.
2764 2018-11-25 20:16:08 Oil prices are falling globally, not only in the US. The fall is due to OPEC actions, and nothing to do with Trump. The sun rose in the east this morning, was that Trump's doing too?

2768 2018-11-25 20:15:58 The point being made is that we need to remain skeptical of any study being performed, as they are all prone to this bias. In terms of climate change, oil companies funded studies are disregarded due to this bias, while studies backed by the green agenda are accepted as clean.

2771 2018-11-25 20:15:46 I think the idea is that cheap oil isn’t affordable either, it just appears so because the costs are borne by society at large, not by the energy companies/consumers. Negative externalities, as economists say.

2775 2018-11-25 20:15:39 I get ill each time I hear "global recession" coming. Yes, eventually there will be a recession. There is always a recession coming. It's just not coming soon. Oil isn't staying low since OPEC is about to make sure of that.
2776 2018-11-25 20:15:30 oil prices being down maybe?

2781 2018-11-25 20:15:03 Donald Trump tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' 

In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% fr Saudi Arabia.

2782 2018-11-25 20:15:02 Saudi Arabia might end up in history books as the reason why most countries finally moved away from oil.

2792 2018-11-25 20:14:35 The current coach is taking a demonstrably different approach with the roster, and stating publicly whats different about it. If the team follows his lead, surely that would qualify as good coaching and a meaningful change.

2794 2018-11-25 20:14:13 Santorum's asinine comment only makes sense when you view it through the lens of Republican projection. The right denies climate change so oil companies other non-green industries can proceed without regulation to pillage the planet.
2795 2018-11-25 20:14:09 Let's assess "both sides" re their respective motivation to mislead: Big oil, big coal, corps that make $ on them, politicians receiving big donations from them vs "scientists getting paid". Sit down @RickSantorum
2796 2018-11-25 20:14:03 Way to go Presidiot T: You really lowered those oil prices with your superior knowledge of supply and demand.
2797 2018-11-25 20:14:00 Look out, your pants are on fire!! Do you know, that we know that it's overproduction of oil, and a world-wide concern for economy, environment and more that is halting prices. I have a feeling that we are soon to be told that Pres T in fact is Santa Claus!..
2798 2018-11-25 20:13:59 But our stupid President doesn’t support oil and gas companies. He is bad for this industry.
2799 2018-11-25 20:13:42 I’ve always wanted to try that kind of joint 
2800 2018-11-25 20:13:41 You don't deserve any credit for falling oil prices and congratulating yourself just makes you look like a clown.
2801 2018-11-25 20:13:37 I have some dry/oil products that might help you too.   Drs said you might find you’re more creative. Lmao  it just puts me straight to sleep. Which is a blessing at night when the pains overwhelming
2802 2018-11-25 20:13:36 Actually, Numbnuts, the thanks go to OPEC, who drove the price up so high a few years ago, that it made us invest in oil shale.  Now, we're the world's largest producer!  This all happened before you, you jackanapes.

2806 2018-11-25 20:13:19 nah we can't do shit without oil

we don't even need to run out of oil for the world to collapse. Right now the price is artificially kept low, but within 20 years, scarcity will push it over $200/barrel...game over
2807 2018-11-25 20:13:19 @jnorthcottCBC @JohnIbbitson seemed to be contradicting himself today on the #sundayscrum saying that, 1. The government is responsible for regulating the economy, and that, 2. The market place determines pricing (of oil).

2815 2018-11-25 20:12:32 You really congratulating yourself in third person and think that President T can meaningfully  influence of the price of oil prices agreed within OPEC, does he?

2818 2018-11-25 20:12:18 Five panic Tweets today so far!  I guess Mueller has you really worried this Thanksgiving weekend. The price of oil won’t protect you when indictments get unsealed.

2820 2018-11-25 20:12:14 Could he mean President T from Canada because he found out the provide 40% of oil not SA?

You have absolutely nothing to do with the price of oil dropping.
2823 2018-11-25 20:12:04 Driven by money? Haha. That’s choice considering the oil industry is run entirely by $grubbers desperately clinging to their hegemony so their legacy can continue for another 100 years. The Russians wish  global warming to be able to access Siberia and Arctic fuel
2824 2018-11-25 20:11:56 Yeah I think this is more than a correction.  Oil prices are also indicating a problem in the economy.  I haven't checked futures for tomorrow but expecting another down day.  Markets haven't reacted to Fridays climate report.  My opinion.  Not advice.

2832 2018-11-25 20:11:34 Gas is refined and carries it's own premiums including tax. Also, adjusted for inflation, gas is dirt cheap. Demand, future demand, drives oil prices (futures) and all signs are pointing to a significant global economic slow down or even worse being imminent.

2836 2018-11-25 20:11:17 Actually I think you're incorrect there. If MBS decides to open the pumps at Trump's request he can have a significant impact on world oil prices. The Saudis have already all but shut down oil production on North America before with the same strategy.
2837 2018-11-25 20:11:12 He’s a con man. Merely a snake oil salesman. Nothing else.
2838 2018-11-25 20:11:01 That IS magic.
2839 2018-11-25 20:11:01 NO !!! Live on butter and coconut oil
2840 2018-11-25 20:10:59 Just checked & nothing from Trump or Departments of Defense or State so far. Maybe after the NFL afternoon games, squeezed in before the night game, the media might react. #Oil market for Monday trading opens at 6 p.m. ET. #KerchStrait #Kerch #KerchBlockade #Ukraine #Russia
2841 2018-11-25 20:10:58 Yeah, we know, Blair. The #ClairRidge field that you so enthusiastically said was all depleted in 2014 is somehow now pumping vast amounts of oil, but it is our imagination. Sure it is.
2842 2018-11-25 20:10:57 Exactly! There isn't a denier that isn't funded by big oil
2843 2018-11-25 20:10:56 But that's called greed, there is a reason why we hate oil companies and greedy companies in general. Sure they are doing it cuz they have to do it, but it's just greed at that point.
2844 2018-11-25 20:10:54 Dealing with climate change and rejecting murder are both huge inconveniences to the oil barons.
The expense is just too much of a bother.
2845 2018-11-25 20:10:42 My cars clean, my oil was changed Friday, and I have a full tank of gas. I totally feel like I have my shit together rn.
2846 2018-11-25 20:10:35 How you swallow that word, wt olive oil?
2847 2018-11-25 20:10:34 Its the worlds worst humanitarian crisis right now. People need to understand that what is going on is about $$ and influence, Yemen isnt a threat to us and we dont need S. Arabia's oil. Its not to fight terrorism. As @senatemajldr said "S Arabia can either buy it from us or
2848 2018-11-25 20:10:28 I feel like if we put a single oil executive on trial for murder, which should be easily provable, this whole thing changes very quickly.
2849 2018-11-25 20:10:23 In california, gas is average 3.79 a gallon. What fall in oil prices?

2855 2018-11-25 20:10:00 So #Americafirst is where we’re so dependent on Saudi setting oil prices we allow them to kill US residents with impunity. Makes sense.
2856 2018-11-25 20:09:55 bobble heads such as yourself, that just nod to whatever idiocy comes out of trump's piehole, who are the most likely to claim climate change isn't true? Maybe Big Oil Cos that actually buried studies showing it's true, but as it would hurt their profits, so choose to lie?>>
2857 2018-11-25 20:09:52 Witch hazel and tea tree oil have worked wonders for my skin. 10/10 would recommend if you struggle with acne prone skin.
2858 2018-11-25 20:09:52 Saudi doesn't have anything America needs. Yes they are a source of money but that's from oil and the WORLD doesn't need to rely upon fossil fuel any longer. Renewable energy would put SA out of business and onto the bread line and they know it. NO ON ANYMORE DEALS WITH SAUDI's.
2859 2018-11-25 20:09:52 Who needs a habitable planet when oil is cheap?! #ThanksPresidentT
2860 2018-11-25 20:09:52 Your newspaper chain is owned by an American hedge fund that is hell bent on promoting the oil industry. If you haven't noticed that all the environmental reporters have been laid off by #Postmedia you are dumber than you look.

2864 2018-11-25 20:09:28 Truman did keep oil.prices low. Thanks for the shout out to him
2865 2018-11-25 20:09:17 ...and the refineries would have been in Scotland, the oil would be extracted by at least one state owned company and the head office jobs would have been in Scotland with the tax income from all those jobs paid to Holyrood 
2866 2018-11-25 20:09:14 Don’t let it get too low I’m an oil field worker and would like to keep my job.
2867 2018-11-25 20:09:13 Saudi's kill a journalist, Trump give them a verbal pass.
Saudi's lower oil prices.

Maybe not in that order.

I like my oil prices lower without anyone's death involved.

2869 2018-11-25 20:09:04 #dragonsden Snake oil. No robust evidence of health benefits.Hipster juice.
2870 2018-11-25 20:09:00 Our economy cannot withstand $50/ barrel oil. We need balance more than cheap gasoline! #energyindependence
2871 2018-11-25 20:08:48 OIL PRICES ARE DROPPING BECAUSE YOU’RE HURTING MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD WITH YOUR CHAOS.
2872 2018-11-25 20:08:48 Can’t choose Canadian oil because it can’t reach the east coast. Are you seriously this stupid?
2873 2018-11-25 20:08:47 Slowing economic growth is just one contributing factor to lower oil prices. Stop acting like you’re the fucking genie in a bottle. I guess the great stock market isn’t something you want to talk about anymore.
2874 2018-11-25 20:08:45 Alaksa was part of russia,usa bought it from russia in 1867,only for around 7 million usd which is peanuts,,now they have discovered large reserves of oil and gas from there ...lol US got lucky
2875 2018-11-25 20:08:41 That’s the same exact thing that happens to me, the oil plus a good foundation is the illusion lol
2876 2018-11-25 20:08:30 @FatKidDeals any new deals for essential oil diffusers?
2877 2018-11-25 20:08:12 As I provided a link to earlier, tge conservative government in 2007 was told this would happen unless we added value to our heavy oil by upgrading. Conservative mismanagement.
2878 2018-11-25 20:08:11 LMAO no part of this is true.  No, you’re not an oil authority just because you’ve worked in it or have a friend that lives in Saudi.  Shit...did you spend the night at a Holiday Inn as well?

2881 2018-11-25 20:07:52 Yes but government incentives to use alternative energy sources helped to grow those industries while weaning ourselves from oil. The USA should be energy independent. Why isn’t it? Make #AmericaFirst with energy independence!
2882 2018-11-25 20:07:49 I think you meant...
So great that oil prices are falling (cause I looked the other way on murder). Add that which is like a big tax cut, unlike the one that was passed. Because if this inflation is up and the economy will eventually go into a bigger recession than 2008. Welcome!
2883 2018-11-25 20:07:49 You see! Consumer continent that has no sense of discernment. We consume holy water, anointing oil, holy soap, holy powder, holy handkerchief, holy rat poison, and other consumables.
2884 2018-11-25 20:07:46 Butts is a hypocrite and anti fossil fuel he was the architect of the mess in Ontario. McGuinty and him brought the green energy policy scam  raising the price of hydro rates to the highest in Canada. Now he's doing the same thing with oil.

1) they don't discount fruit & veg on the day they go out of date because the staff ended up getting lots half price(!)
2) they bin it that night!
2888 2018-11-25 20:07:33 I’ve known my best friend for 22 years, today is the first time she has ever cooked for me. Think she was a little worried about this by 8:30 I had got 4 texts to check if I could have butter, oil and Yorkshire puddings. She did amazing  #pku #BestFriend
2889 2018-11-25 20:07:30 My Sicilian grandmother stuffed them with breadcrumbs mixed with grated pecorino Romano cheese, salt & pepper and olive oil.
2890 2018-11-25 20:07:27 Poor real butter and non-hydrogenated coconut oil, which are both good for you, have been through hell and back. How they were pushing vegetable oil and margarine in the 70s/80s was disgusting.

2893 2018-11-25 20:07:22 Falling oil prices will hurt in the end. But it’s what you can talk about now that the stock market has taken a natural correction. So good luck when you have nothing left to talk about. Of course then it will be someone else’s fault...most likely the Dems.
2894 2018-11-25 20:07:20 Jojoba oil has changed my life 
2895 2018-11-25 20:07:16 I should've told someone to get some coconut oil...
2896 2018-11-25 20:07:05 I am better. Sleep helped. I've slathered myself in cbd oil. It is the 1st real relief I have had today.
2897 2018-11-25 20:06:54 Gasoline is going down (good - means Russia is hurting).  Below $2 here in Texas.  BUT, I would much prefer to pay whatever and tell the Middle East and Russia to take a hike; that we don't need their oil.
2898 2018-11-25 20:06:51 Cake. That oil isnt hot...im getting the hang of this. Now if it was a paella with chorizo maybe I'd question it more lol
2899 2018-11-25 20:06:25 Right.  There’s so much oil, surfactants, dispersants and polymers in that water that e.Coli cannot survive.  Lots of stinky sulfate reducing bacteria, though.  I don’t want to eat them either.
2900 2018-11-25 20:06:23 Dutch should’ve caught the smoke since the oil factory
2901 2018-11-25 20:06:12 Many variables go into gas pump prices...In my state, when the prices were falling our prick of a GOV raised taxes on gas AFTER it failed at the ballot!  There R some people VERY INVESTED in Trump failing- if price of oil is low, per barrel, but high at the pump-LOOK ELSEWHERE
2902 2018-11-25 20:06:08 President T. - what is the price of oil? What is the price of a gallon of gasoline? Do you even know or really care? Have you ever filled your gas tank? Have you ever visited a gas station?
2903 2018-11-25 20:06:03 Exactly - deregulation is a boon for industry only, not for the people who have to suffer the consequences. Same as deregulation was a boon for the people running banks until they crashed and the the people had to bail them out. You can't eat money or drink oil or polluted water

2913 2018-11-25 20:05:05 Too much.  Like Exxon when hid their big report?  Or all big oil interests and lobbyists?  Or those who work for them in office like Donald Trump and company? Zinke... and Santorum?  They sure know "driven by the money".  #Scientists are scientists, not politicians, for a reason.
2914 2018-11-25 20:05:03 Didn’t we bail out banks, the auto industry, the aviation industry and the oil industry when they hit upon hard times?
Actually didn’t your government do that to those industries?

2929 2018-11-25 20:04:06 Are you for real?Oil prices are tanking and it isnt due to your friends the Saudis. As 4 your tax cut, I’ll be paying more starting next year.I fall into a category between middle class and rich.But my middle class friends will be paying more2. So stuff your self congratualtions
2930 2018-11-25 20:04:06 WE DONT NEED THEM. They literally provide nothing we need anymore. 11% of our oil comes from KSA. We could get 3% more each from the four larger suppliers above them and never need anything from them again. Name a single other benefit to our relationship with KSA that we NEED.
2931 2018-11-25 20:04:04 Who sell oil Cartridges?

2938 2018-11-25 20:03:44 Fucking snake oil salesmen
2939 2018-11-25 20:03:41 Plus he is full of shit about a lot of his claims.. The obvious one. The first case on his list was appealed down to 21.7million. That’s 420 million off the top of that 1 billion he claims he won for clients. He is a snake oil salesman?
2940 2018-11-25 20:03:40 @PressSec so "he" thanks himself for low oil prices.....his ego knows no bounds.....please tell him I'm not seeing lower gas prices....all for show
2941 2018-11-25 20:03:39 it's not fair to assume the world's wealth when the British royal family has thousands of charitable organizations with hidden billions if not trillions in them. Never mind the other Royal families like the Saudi who own the world's biggest oil deposits but never declare assets.
2942 2018-11-25 20:03:27 Fixing to get the oil changed on my dually.
2943 2018-11-25 20:03:18 Sammich tiiiime!

Signed: Management 
2946 2018-11-25 20:02:56 Funny thing, oil doesn't really do huge capitulation candles at the very bottom of such large moves, put otherwise, the one on Friday definitely qualifies as one. I accept evidence to the contrary.
2947 2018-11-25 20:02:51 You realize falling oil prices is now actually a net drag on the economy? But your not actually knowledgeable about business. So no. You don’t realize that.
2948 2018-11-25 20:02:46 Thanks, Hasan.  I now check labels for palm oil and don't buy the product if it contains the oil. I'm only one person, but everything success starts small and builds.  

Everyone: Please join & check your labels too.
2949 2018-11-25 20:02:42 Nothing  Saudi Arabia killing an American to keep oil prices  down, Right Donald?
2950 2018-11-25 20:02:40 Ah yes those trustworthy oil barons who regularly destroy towns when their pipes break.
2951 2018-11-25 20:02:39 I just paid $50+ to fill my gas tank (compact sedan).   When will we see these so -called lower oil prices?  Shouldn’t prices adjust immediately?  Your rhetoric is deceptive BS
2952 2018-11-25 20:02:38 Just saw a Williamsburg coffee shop selling CBD oil as a supplement and honestly I’m kind of shocked I didn’t see it on the West Coast first???
2953 2018-11-25 20:02:35 My local has Neck Oil on draught....very easy supping stuff 
2954 2018-11-25 20:02:30 So would Florida sinking and California burning.  But @SenMikeLee probably doesn’t care; his oil money contributions are quite safe.
2955 2018-11-25 20:02:24 Just a little tidbit, my M65 wheel was almost non-responsive and squeaking like hell when I rolled it. 

I opened it and lubed the wheel with non-conductive oil and it's good a new again. If you're comfortable opening it up that is.
2956 2018-11-25 20:02:08 You taking credit for the recent oil price reduction - is pathetic.
2957 2018-11-25 20:02:03 Crude Oil prices are set by supply and demand and commodity traders on exchanges. T has been advocating for increased production which leads to lower prices.
2958 2018-11-25 20:02:02 Going to make jalapeño cheese burgers for lunches this week, with broccoli (that has sesame oil and garlic salt on it). Excited for lunches!
2959 2018-11-25 20:01:53 Especially when oil and gas companies want to privately invest and all the government does is get in the way and scare investment away. Just terrible.
2960 2018-11-25 20:01:52 Mum is talking about me using CBD oil but I'm a bit square about this sort of thing, even on/for Rino, what do the Twitter say?

Fair to say Rino and I are both getting a bit sore recently, though fortunately for Rino he wasn't born with a muscle condition like myself, just aging

2969 2018-11-25 20:00:52 Truly a modern day Snake Oil Salesman. When it’s all said and done, that will be all you are remembered as. #oilprices #trump #President #WorstPresidentEver
2970 2018-11-25 20:00:49 No he doesn't.  Get over it.  Oil is a global commodity.  Transport is factored into things.  Much Oil is supposedly sitting in tankers waiting for prices to rise.  But that may just be a conspiracy theory.
2971 2018-11-25 20:00:42 I’ve been fooled by snake oil sales men before, on a way larger scale than a silly tweet. It can happen to anyone.

2976 2018-11-25 20:00:15 Oil was important then too.
2977 2018-11-25 20:00:14 Yea that and the fingerprints on the Smart Cover. Like there are always smudges on it which is odd. I guess it’s oil but seems new for the plastic covers. Oh if only I could go back to the days where I couldn’t make finger smudges on things

2979 2018-11-25 20:00:04 The oil / gas reserves were similar but Norway has a tiny population of 5 million vs UK of 66m.  They also have a tiny fraction of UK infrastructure costs.  So they have he same natural wealth but just a tiny level of the UK cost ergo they are richer.
2980 2018-11-25 20:00:02 Trying a new oil for my scalp
2981 2018-11-25 20:00:00 it has to do with Game Theory.  The Saudis control the entire market for oil because they have trillions in the bank, and they can produce a barrel for $2. The rest of the world is about $18-55 per barrel. If they honor a request from Trump to lower the price, they can ...

She would have been beholden to oil companies and big Pharma. She would not have fought for $15 an hour. She is week when it comes to social issues.
2986 2018-11-25 19:59:50 Why do we give subsidies to oil companies? How come they can ask the government to do for them, but we can't? WE PAY THE FUCKIN TAXES FOR IT.
2987 2018-11-25 19:59:49 And considering those traders only access to water for cleaning their food utensils, pans and more is from trips to the Grainger Market toilets then I certainly wouldn’t be eating there.

As for cooking oil removal NCC street cleaners do tell of fat straight down the drains ...
2988 2018-11-25 19:59:46 At least Trump will not care As long as he can have a deal on Russian oil as well.
2989 2018-11-25 19:59:44 In reality there isn't many people in the United States that are willing to accept higher oil prices in exchange for the sanctions... However the news media will never tell the people that is going to be the result...
2990 2018-11-25 19:59:42 C'mon now. 400,000+ barrels per day of Alberta's heavy oil goes to the Gulf coast - that's tidewater at a major deep-water port.  If Asia had offered a penny more a barrel than the USA that bitumen would've been on a tanker.  Other oil products aren't experiencing pricing crisis.
2991 2018-11-25 19:59:42 And since when has America First been buying foreign oil?
2992 2018-11-25 19:59:41 Ding ding ding, Russia needs moar cash, starts a war to raise oil prices
2993 2018-11-25 19:59:40 Where’s our energy independence? Why isn’t he making #AmericaFirst and put tariffs on foreign oil? Tariffs on oil produced in #USA that is exported? #makeAmericaGreatAgain  we don’t need no stinking foreign oil!
2994 2018-11-25 19:59:40 The time we were kids and we mistakenly poured palm oil on the carpet, nothing was more annoying than trying to hide the evidence. When you clean the carpet the rag will stain, when you wash the rag the soap will stain.

3004 2018-11-25 19:58:36 With winter upon us, just a friendly reminder to oil/lube your reels. Also backing off brakes and drag can help them perform better and last longer. It’s a pain now, but you’ll be ready to go in the spring! Also, you can check your rods for any damage before you store them.

3009 2018-11-25 19:58:27 No. That was aspiration. Totally different.
3010 2018-11-25 19:58:25 Yeah! What's up with that nonsense?!?
3011 2018-11-25 19:58:23 Reasonably low #oilprices are nice with emphasis on REASONABLY. When oil goes too low Americans in the oil business start losing #jobs. This is something #potus needs to be cautious about when he calls for even lower oil prices.
3012 2018-11-25 19:58:22 Bought one of the batch loaves on Friday. Delicious!! Do you add beef dripping ?? Or vegetable oil to the dough ??
3013 2018-11-25 19:58:17 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
3014 2018-11-25 19:58:10 We also need to keep oil price balanced and not going any lower. Or oil workers may lose jobs.
3015 2018-11-25 19:58:08 So very sad that you actually think you have anything to do with oil prices. Your such a child!
3016 2018-11-25 19:58:01 me flirting im 2018: whats more sexy? You ... or sustainable living?

3018 2018-11-25 19:57:59 YES it is true but amended & watered down by evil Bush Sr to get middle east oil. @POTUS can reenact the original but will he? He will if we the people demand it! We must get our 65 million growing to demand it! SHARE SHARE SHARE send to @POTUS
3019 2018-11-25 19:57:54 Cannabis oil?
3020 2018-11-25 19:57:53 Change is rough  but you need to think a bit more about the environment, indigenous peoples, and letting go of oil.... The federal govt is already indicated support for  your plans .... You are asking too much and forgetting the roots of the party you represent.
3021 2018-11-25 19:57:53 international community should react with SWIFT and oil embargo against russia...
3022 2018-11-25 19:57:51 No hesitation. Lol “but what about her oil” head ass lol
3023 2018-11-25 19:57:50 Unfortunately for "president T", he can either appease his Oil Industry supporters with higher oil prices (= higher gas prices), OR he can appease the American public with lower gas prices (= lower oil prices). His trying to run back and forth between those targets is grueling.

No mom, I’m gonna be a climate scientist!

3033 2018-11-25 19:57:03 ARE MY NEIGHBORS FUCKING WHILE I’M READING ARTICLES ON WHY OLIVE OIL IS EXPENSIVE
3034 2018-11-25 19:56:55 Are you talking Teddy Roosevelt, who broke up Standard Oil, allowing for better, and more open competition? That would make sense. Otherwise this is complete nonsense, and even if so, are you calling your....help... from the Saudi's a tax cut?
3035 2018-11-25 19:56:40 We need to treat climate change like we did with Big Tabacco. Ban advertising for cars and oil companies, tax it to death, and sue to get back their ill gotten gains which we use for addressing the deleterious effects.
3036 2018-11-25 19:56:27 If we had government at all levels aligned, these provinces could far surpass Alberta's oil contribution to our national economy while building robust, innovative local industries
3037 2018-11-25 19:56:27 YOU'RE a LYING NAZI!! Oil prices are about to go right back UP, IT MOST CERTAINLY IS NOT A TAX CUT AND INFLATION IS RISING FASTER THAN WAGES!!
3038 2018-11-25 19:56:25 Since you take credit for the oil prices going down. Just want to remind you that this means you are entirely to blame when the prices go up.
3039 2018-11-25 19:56:24 The largest sources of U.S.imported oil were: Canada (40%),Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela(9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%). According to the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and natural gas industry supports nine million
3040 2018-11-25 19:56:22 The irony that antivaxers think health care professionals are wrong about vaccines, but we do know our stuff when it comes to things like trauma medicine. 

I’m thinking rosemary oil won’t save you if you have a compound fracture or are haemorrhaging to death.
3041 2018-11-25 19:56:19 Makes a lot of sense 
3042 2018-11-25 19:56:17 Cheers Jay! I’ve got a Harviestoun engine oil black ale on the go x
3043 2018-11-25 19:56:08 It wouldn’t be so bad if it weren’t for the rwc sm self aggrandize,ent and outright lying not t mention condoning the murder of an American journalist plus he lies about who we actually buy oil from 
3044 2018-11-25 19:56:05 The crux of the global warming denialism conspiracy theory is that scientists were willing, in overwhelming numbers, to falsify studies for a paycheck and somehow ended up working for the government instead of giant oil companies.
3045 2018-11-25 19:56:04 Quebec will still have their Industry, Ontario will still have their auto industry, which helps all of Canada but Oil is bigger in dollars than both and because he knows nothing about it , he turns a blind eye, it’s money, what about our own east using west oil ? Like ?? Come on.
3046 2018-11-25 19:55:59 Who has got a good beard oil they recommend
3047 2018-11-25 19:55:58 I’d love to win- looking to buy my father some CBD oil for his neck and back pain
3048 2018-11-25 19:55:52 Oil prices will stay down if we invest in renewable energy. Create jobs and rely less on other countries. But you won’t support that becuase oil owns you.
3049 2018-11-25 19:55:49 It would only be harmful to Exxon and the other oil companies who own Senator Lee. It would be great for solar and wind and everything else.
3050 2018-11-25 19:55:42 @Witsend08135301 I'm glad to find you here, I have another friend, here, that had a stroke, and has aphasia. My son, a Navy Vet, had a stroke at 30. Still some aphasia. Right hand showing improvement after 10yrs w/Medical Cannabis Oil. It's amazing.

3052 2018-11-25 19:55:32 Goshhh id love to have fucking company over I just repainted the kitchen and got a cute Valence and a painting from Kirkland’s and the whole theme is Lemons, Olive Oil, and yellow flowers.
3053 2018-11-25 19:55:30 even better used cooking oil can be converted to fuel
3054 2018-11-25 19:55:28 Yes I am hating. Tired of modern day snake oil salesmen getting paid off the backs of Black folks. Hucksters build up a fan base by pretending to be for the people only to turn around and sell Black folks out to advertisers that peddle worthless remedies and trinkets. Enough!
3055 2018-11-25 19:55:28 Except we get very little of our oil from the Middle East anymore.
3056 2018-11-25 19:55:28 Oh yeah yeah bs "beto". Make sure by taking big oil money and claim you're a progressive. #noshame
3057 2018-11-25 19:55:12 CBD oil is a godsend
3058 2018-11-25 19:55:12 Let’s count the number of airlines bankrupted in last 15 years. Business model of airlines is tough.with oil prices reaching 85, they hav very less rabbits in the bag.I don’t want to pay more,but they r bleeding financially every quarter.i do wish they cud hav done ths gracefully
3059 2018-11-25 19:55:06 Roughly 65% of a barrel of oil is used for transportation. Vast, vast majority of that is gas and diesel for cars and trucks. Vast majority of that is personal transport, not commercial. That's about 50% of the demand poised to leave the oil market in short order.
3060 2018-11-25 19:55:03 Bio oil
3061 2018-11-25 19:55:03 would of thought NATGAS & OIL may jump on this, esp European NATGAS
3062 2018-11-25 19:54:54 Very. Almost found oil out there!
3063 2018-11-25 19:54:49 Whoever he is talking about, or to, low oil price is no good for the American shale gas industry... USA is better off with a high oil price...
3064 2018-11-25 19:54:48 The anti-Trudeau protest in Calgary was a cattle call organized by the CPC/UCP and friends. Attendees were used as extras in a political stunt. I suspect most don't actually know what is being done but they were happy to show off their "oil patriotism". /2 #cdnpoli #abpoli
3065 2018-11-25 19:54:46 So demand for oil started to rise at the end of the steam era?
Wow. Good work, Sherlock.
3066 2018-11-25 19:54:45 Write your senators and representatives and ask that the Mueller Report be made public. Ask that the LAW apply to the President. Ask that the financial disclosure of the Presidents dealings with RUSSIA be known. Ask that the environment be saved & Oil abandoned as fuel, FREEDOM!!
3067 2018-11-25 19:54:41 It’s just so childishly predictable. Bad optics on his “stance” on Khashoggi, so he focuses on falling oil prices. God I can’t wait for this whole nightmare to end.
3068 2018-11-25 19:54:39 I mix agricultural strength vinegar with water and orange oil. It’s awesome.
3069 2018-11-25 19:54:36 If oil is $45 a barrel how come gasoline isn’t $1.50 a gallon?
3070 2018-11-25 19:54:29 Also they brought my grandpa CBD oil
3071 2018-11-25 19:54:26 DM to Alberta: Do something else. Take this drop in oil price as a sign to do something other than destroy the earth. Thanks. #abpoli
3072 2018-11-25 19:54:19 We have innovated our way to the future, it is called Solar, Wind, electric cars, and a carbon tax.
Jackasses like Sasse who are owned by oil companies refuse to vote for that though.
3073 2018-11-25 19:54:15 The motor oil is killing me.
3074 2018-11-25 19:54:12 I'm an oil lover (who isn't, we all use it). Electric cars will continue to see a growing market, but the utility of petrol vehicles is not even close to being challenged yet. Hybrids will probably see highest growth long run as it takes best of both worlds.
3075 2018-11-25 19:54:07 Mormons are creepy. Mainly because I don't understand them and partly because I'm not mormon so it must be evil.
3076 2018-11-25 19:54:07 i have massive quantities of dry shampoo and pomade and oil and hairspray in it that’s why haha
3077 2018-11-25 19:54:01 why is olive oil so expensive????
3078 2018-11-25 19:54:01 So you look the other way to the murder of an American-based journalist, and the starvation of people in Yemen so oil prices drop and you can bully the Fed into lowering interest rates. Now that's moral leadership.
3079 2018-11-25 19:53:58 can’t believe my gay ass needs to get an oil change... shocked and upset
3080 2018-11-25 19:53:57 Maple syrup is for Canadians what Coconut oil is for Tamilians?
3081 2018-11-25 19:53:53 America is capable of surpassing oil production of all Middle Eastern countries so why not break up OPEC.
3082 2018-11-25 19:53:43 You do know that it not entirely a good thing. US Oil production is naturally more expensive, thus this impacts their profits and over-supply is an indication of a slowing economy. So we can thank for that President T.
3083 2018-11-25 19:53:37 Big Oil and climate change deniers. Lol next question.
3084 2018-11-25 19:53:36 Until he wasn’t, and didn’t. 

Accepting money from oil industry while using public airwaves to criticize opponents is not how one preserves their ‘integrity’.
3085 2018-11-25 19:53:23 Isn’t the USA the world’s leading oil producer? How do low prices help?
3086 2018-11-25 19:53:19 You (USA) get 40% of your oil from  Canada so surely he is referring to President Trudeau  ?
3087 2018-11-25 19:53:18 bomb the shit out of those jihadists and bring their oil HOME!
3088 2018-11-25 19:53:14 Forgot how much I hate Chinese food. So we got Chinese food and now I remember! Way too much oil!

3090 2018-11-25 19:53:02 Falling oil prices will put a lot of domestic oilfield workers out of work.
3091 2018-11-25 19:52:46 Only give what you can afford but v good thought.   Worth buying electric oil radiator for emergencies.  I’m lost without mine .
3092 2018-11-25 19:52:44 Really!  You actually believe that you alone are responsible for reducing oil costs. Oh, wait, I forget you are a classic narcissist and you alone are responsible for everything good. Have not heard you talk much about the stock market lately......
3093 2018-11-25 19:52:43 I don't want to blame the engineers - they wanted to build the most sophisticated tank possible. I just think pol-mil command should not have let them go through with that.
And German maneuver strategy came more and more to its limits due to lack of oil.
3094 2018-11-25 19:52:36 Make #AmericaFirst and #makeAmericaGreatAgain  by making us energy independent. Use #Americanoil only! Tariffs on foreign oil! Export tax for oil going out of the #USA.  That’s what you can do President T.
3095 2018-11-25 19:52:32 Yes but you also don’t want off shore drilling,  a pipeline to deliver it, oil rigs in Alaska or fracking. So take you’re lil estimate and double it for starter.

3099 2018-11-25 19:51:45 Well...the fact that the oil industry that he shills for has no financial interest in discrediting climate science does reflect badly on those money grubbing scientists. Sanatorium is such a dildo.
3100 2018-11-25 19:51:42 His success is fake. The premise he is selling his picks on (3rd party track record of success) is fabricated. 

I don’t know how else to say it. 

Unethical, snake oil sales man.
3101 2018-11-25 19:51:39 Few u.s. soldiers who fought in Kuwait owned oil companies. It’s an easily verifiable fact that most were poor volunteers desperate for healthcare and economic security. Isn’t that amazing?
3102 2018-11-25 19:51:32 “Did you use avacado oil to cook with, no? I’m outta here. “ 
3103 2018-11-25 19:51:20 Yes and the lower oil price has a worldwide positive effect.Where are the TRUMP opponents now!
3104 2018-11-25 19:51:11 International crises tend to make oil prices rise. Putin most likely sees this as a win-win for him. Rile up the Russian public  and make them feel threatened, and get more cash coming in
3105 2018-11-25 19:50:58 If you truly think that “Conservatives” ensured that there was only one customer for the oil, I have a snow-covered solar panel to sell you.
3106 2018-11-25 19:50:58 Season 2, Episode 6, Jet Engine + Pickup Truck, with Bozer and Riley in the Nigerian village, before the oil well got worse.
3107 2018-11-25 19:50:56 I just finished what I think was my best homemade pasta dish yet. Pasta with portobello mushrooms. The key is to slowly cook the moisture out of them (they are sliced, of course) in olive oil, garlic, and fresh thyme sprigs. Takes about 45 minutes.
3108 2018-11-25 19:50:55 You’re thinking of gasoline, not oil. Good try though.
3109 2018-11-25 19:50:52 You are a fool! We have so much oil now, businesses are abouy to flop cause of this. We need to push solor and save our planet while we can! Of course, you are getting rich, so you are pushing o&g.
How much they paying you?
3110 2018-11-25 19:50:46 Our largest supplier of oil is Canada. We do not need to appease the KSA. Amerikkka is on track to be the largest producer of oil in the next few years.
3111 2018-11-25 19:50:45 like i said i have IBS so I'm not actually medically intolerant to anything, my bowels just react to things randomly!! you can't be intolerant to oil and sugar but it just triggers my ibs so it can't be tested for, and it's been like this since before my ed & also it's the same
3112 2018-11-25 19:50:44 When oil went 2 $20/bbl the Texas economy did not falter. It, in fact, improved. When fuel prices go down cost of mfg, shipping, travel, heating, cooling, farming, ranching & food all decrease. The entire country benefits while poor Big Oil/Gas take a profit margin hit. Poor them
3113 2018-11-25 19:50:28 We can find ways to use the alternative energy as our primary source with oil/gas as a back up. Even just lower costs on electric heat would help!
3114 2018-11-25 19:50:26 The middle east for example will run out of oil and will have to diversify her economies. Women do not have to work right now, but in the future they will have to. China similarly is pumping billions into African nations, which is developing those economies.
3115 2018-11-25 19:50:24 Firsts of all you have NO Control over oil or Gas Prices! You Lie so much to the American People! OPEC Controls the oil prices.  You will be impeached! Due to the muller Investigation! Stop Lying to the American People! Blue Wave Has Come!!
3116 2018-11-25 19:50:16 Blood for oil
3117 2018-11-25 19:50:15 Please understand that most of your oil comes from Canada. Price drops are due to Canadian over capacity and pipeline politics
3118 2018-11-25 19:50:14 I cant wait for karma to bite me back and oil prices going to 3.00 in the next few months. Prices will always fluctuate. So this is pointless
3119 2018-11-25 19:50:11 If you are up to getting some eucalyptus oil from vitamin store, a few drops in pot of steaming water does wonders to clear your airways in addition to the chicken soup.
3120 2018-11-25 19:50:06 And of course the same can be said for your "side". Fake data is prolific among you know, big oil companies trying to keep regulations off.
3121 2018-11-25 19:50:02 I'm going to sell my soul/degree/credibility for money. Hmmm should I take the position of Big Oil... Or oppose them? Hmmmmm.... 
3122 2018-11-25 19:49:56 I love to marinate cauliflower in olive oil and garlic.
3123 2018-11-25 19:49:46 Sorry, I have to do that in order to relate to women when they talk about shoes.
3124 2018-11-25 19:49:46 Crude oil is used for both petrol and diesel. Why has petrol been reduced and diesel not? Presumably it's so that you can say you've reduced the price of fuel - which is sort of half true.
3125 2018-11-25 19:49:37 Oil price being manipulated again?
3126 2018-11-25 19:49:21 Starting to think my yoga teachers are putting something in that essential oil thing....I feel high as a kite
3127 2018-11-25 19:49:19 Y’all know mineral oil ain’t nothing but baby oil or does the same job as baby oil
3128 2018-11-25 19:49:14 #RT @SexAdviceBot: For aftercare, try using a massage oil

3130 2018-11-25 19:49:12 Im a fan of expensive shoes and purses but I have one at a time.
I have one very expensive purse that I bought with my first paycheck after I graduated and I haven’t bought one every since, and I’m not going to until this one breaks and dies.

3131 2018-11-25 19:49:08 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
3132 2018-11-25 19:49:03 Actually the logic is sound. He is talking about congressional/government proposals. A majority of ideas take money and not using big money items like oil/gas.
3133 2018-11-25 19:49:02 I need you to get some extra virgin olive oil, ask the Lord to bless it as anointing oil! Anoint her and you in Yeshua Jesus name! Touch her head! Command anything evil to be bound and removed! Please LORD,touch,heal,restore, in your mighty power! In Yeshua Jesus our Lord Amen!
3134 2018-11-25 19:49:00 AbTech Industries also provides unique water management solutions for upstream, midstream and downstream industries in oil & gas.  Our products and solutions have been deployed in shale basins, gas fields, platforms, refineries, chemical plants and compression facilities.
3135 2018-11-25 19:48:54 Would love to see a hindcast on Tight Oil deals over the last 3 years. $50,000+ per Acre, assuming 26+ wells per section....absolutely laughable metrics
3136 2018-11-25 19:48:54 We get less than 20% of imported oil from Saudi Arabia.  We can get along just fine without their oil, but can Trump Enterprises get by without Saudi gold?
3137 2018-11-25 19:48:53 Gas is 1.99 at Morgan Oil and Fast Fuel!!!!
3138 2018-11-25 19:48:49 Oil prices are right about where they were when you took office. So by your reasoning, you're responsible for oil going up to $82 a barrel since you took office. Right?
3139 2018-11-25 19:48:29 all is good -  build a huge pipeline to the coast .... flog more oil ....  sell it all
3140 2018-11-25 19:48:28 Petroleum products don't work like regular commodities. OPEC releases more oil when prices are high and less when they're low - it's complicated.
3141 2018-11-25 19:48:28 I don't remember any great volume of praise for Obama on gas prices.

It's a two edged sword anyway. When the price of oil drops below the cost of extracting it profitably then there's no choice but to shut down production with lost jobs. I remember more criticism for that.
3142 2018-11-25 19:48:24 Of you think oil can have. Sustained rally , $dnr moved from under 2 to over 6 
Similar to tpl
Why I have no clue
I was hoping you would do the research cuz I am lazy and not that smart
3143 2018-11-25 19:48:18 Oil prices been raising what cave you living under?
3144 2018-11-25 19:48:16 Novello olive oil 2018
3145 2018-11-25 19:48:13 I need an olive oil brush.
3146 2018-11-25 19:48:12 as a person I am fed up of our over reliance on oil. I am one who hopes for it to dry up miraculously.
3147 2018-11-25 19:48:12 Remember when the rich people destroyed the natural resources? That sure was awesome, wasn't it?

Especially when the oil guy set all his wells on fire. Not only did that destroy the oil, it put tons of deadly pollutants into the atmosphere.
3148 2018-11-25 19:48:09 LOL so you're crediting Duggie with crashing the price of crude oil? The idiocy of conservatives never ceases to amaze...
3149 2018-11-25 19:47:58 I put this oil in a pan now I don’t even want eggs 
3150 2018-11-25 19:47:51 My college football team got embarrassed, my pro team is getting embarrassed, I ate to much and skipped the gym all weekend but I found a coupon for a $19.99 oil change online, so overall thanksgiving was a win. #Thanksgiving2018 #winning
3151 2018-11-25 19:47:48 Fun fact: Not in a significant enough amount to make hedges or contracts viable. 
Fun fact: Heavy oil isn't our only product. Alberta is home to prolific oil plays producing high quality oils, LNG and condensate. Unbelievable amounts of condensate.
3152 2018-11-25 19:47:43 Bio oil x
3153 2018-11-25 19:47:31 Industrial cooking oil
3154 2018-11-25 19:47:27 So...you're taking credit for falling oil prices because that's the price of a murdered journalist???
3155 2018-11-25 19:47:20 Being a November baby, I love this time of year. Even with the rain pouring down (yes, I wish it were snow) I can sit back, eating chicken noodle soup plus garlic bread with olive oil and feel a warmth, a comfort, that I don't experience during any other season
3156 2018-11-25 19:47:19 Some men are easy to hate. Until you need your oil changed.
3157 2018-11-25 19:47:18 @Realdonaldtrump If its #America First ... why do you use 40% foreign oil from #Canada? and #Canada Refine the damn #Tarsands crud here for domestic use....  other wise #leaveitinttheground ITS KILLING US ALL #Notley ##Trudeau #cdnpoli #BCpoli we don't want risking going overseas
3158 2018-11-25 19:47:14 Personal agenda? You bet. JT and @gmbutts are running the show and Alberta’s oil and gas are not on the program. Period.
3159 2018-11-25 19:46:49 But oil/gas companies aren’t driven by money. Ok got it.
3160 2018-11-25 19:46:47 See how he skipped right over the “if your health get bad part” and went hard on oil changes. 
3161 2018-11-25 19:46:38 Oil painting in progress ( drowing)
3162 2018-11-25 19:46:34 So delusional Don what do you think you had to do with falling oil prices?
3163 2018-11-25 19:46:33 Como no se le quedo sin gas oil el colectivo justo en ese momento... Que desgracia
3164 2018-11-25 19:46:33 I don't need to, as I have already said I know what they do is wrong but stop acting like our Government is perfect and what they say and do is correct and the truth. Our Government pretty much destroyed the middle east for oil.
3165 2018-11-25 19:46:28 Ya great  achievement Donald T nothing like Expected Murder For Cheap Oil in America
3166 2018-11-25 19:46:27 Is it time for the big oil companies to see immense profits with challenge of climate change?
3167 2018-11-25 19:46:24 Wolf Spa Bournemouth
Monday will soon be here and the weather is cold why not pop along for a nice warming massage by a male therapist. The showers are hot and so is the studio – hot oil massage, hot stones massage.
60 mins £40, 45 mins £30 and 30 mins is only £20.
3168 2018-11-25 19:46:22 Angry the media is all left wing and not truthfulling reporting the news.  Angry that we allow foreign interests to shut down our oil industry ie pipeline.   Angry that everyone is a victim these days.  Angry that due process is bypassed for must believe.
3169 2018-11-25 19:46:19 That motor oil thing blew my mind
3170 2018-11-25 19:46:09 We rub shea butter and palm kernel oil
3171 2018-11-25 19:45:57 So suprised that a guy with such a high IQ - would suggest his own experience with a TSLA is representative of the AGING OF EVs..and talk about Oil lobbies being behind the press..these guys were glorifying Musk before he got into trouble with the clusterfuck that is the M3...
3172 2018-11-25 19:45:56 Finally, I can afford to buy a barrel of oil for everyone on my Christmas list.

BUT GAS PRICE PER GALLON IS STILL MORE THAN 50% HIGHER THAN IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO.

So I can't afford to pick it up. Does it come with free shipping?
3173 2018-11-25 19:45:52 Look at actual oil import stats. Don't be fooled...know who the enemy really is....Knowledge will make you free (not an original thought but still true)
3174 2018-11-25 19:45:51 I'm old enough to remember when no one wanted a problem with the United States, but yeah, I take your point.     #KerchStrait #KerchBlockade #oil
3175 2018-11-25 19:45:45 I agree in general Rick. 

In specific the same US ENGO's campaigning against Alberta oil got to Obama and blocked XL for years. 

So not black and white on the conspiracy thing. And aren't conspiracies meant to be secret?  This one isn't.
3176 2018-11-25 19:45:42 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
3177 2018-11-25 19:45:33 Thank you President T for selling America’s moral compass for Saudi Oil.  Yep saving a few cents a gallon is much more important to America than justice for a man brutally murdered for standing up against an oppressive leader!  Guess you owe the Saudis more money than we knew!
3178 2018-11-25 19:45:31 Since we get 40% of oil from Canada I think “President T” is @JustinTrudeau
3179 2018-11-25 19:45:22 Oil glut.
3180 2018-11-25 19:45:20 شلون همه الكرسي.. إذا ما تقعد لهم وتبين كل اللي قاعد يسير خطأ عيل لاطبنا ولا غدا الشر
3181 2018-11-25 19:45:20 If you need an oil boy, holla 
3182 2018-11-25 19:45:17 You’re taking credit for oil prices. Hahahahaha
3183 2018-11-25 19:45:12 You do NOT control oil prices, but let’s talk about some things you are responsible for, President T... the immensely important effect of climate change, the hundreds of babies still held in exile on US soil, rise of white supremacy a.k.a “nationalism,” the $1 trillion deficit...
3184 2018-11-25 19:45:07 May your pot of wisdom not run dry. You will oil till you die egbon.
3185 2018-11-25 19:45:01 Trump means oil $$$, so GREED, a Gordon Gekko.
3186 2018-11-25 19:44:52 Pentagon & the 5 US Armed Service Depts all agree. They have known this for over a decade. Exxon & Big Oil knew this too. yet, #MSM keep making this #Bothsides Crap when they know better. This is why Money, ads $ is so corrupt in our society today.
3187 2018-11-25 19:44:51 could someone swing me $40 so i can get my oil changed/tires rotated 
3188 2018-11-25 19:44:51 Another unsettled night last night. Think it’s because she’s still a bit bunged up. Tried Snufflebabe vapour oil and even a nose sucker thing. Still reluctant to try the saline stuff. Let’s see how she is tonight and maybe try some more fresh air tomorrow.
3189 2018-11-25 19:44:39 Smh should’ve given @TheAustinPorter my oil painting stuff , I really flopped this time
3190 2018-11-25 19:44:38 Oil prices are dropping because demand is slowing. And demand is slowing because the economy is slowing down. The US produces most of the oil it consumes you idiot. So this actually hurts US oil companies.
3191 2018-11-25 19:44:31 perfect scene but leather catsuit oil and anal scene pleaseee
3192 2018-11-25 19:44:30 @Billykirkwood ah cunt in Aberdeen taks a pay cheque fae the Saudis oil money!
3193 2018-11-25 19:44:28 Eyes on #Ukraine tonight. Anything from oil price to rotten bridge building seems to drive RU actions. Obviously picking a fight isn't done without political orders-now we all have to shine a light on general RU info spins on this to help Ukraine
PING @20committee @patrikoksanen
3194 2018-11-25 19:44:28 I live on a steady diet of fig newtons and I make sure to rub thieves oil in my eyes every three hours. 

Please advise.
3195 2018-11-25 19:44:13 Lower crude oil price means less money for Trump’s supporters - Harold Hamm, Putin and  his oligarchs, the Koch Brothers, oil producing states like Texas,Oklahoma. Everything Trump touches dies.
3196 2018-11-25 19:44:09 I didn’t know the US was supplying France with oil, the protests are all to do with the rising cost of gas.
3197 2018-11-25 19:44:08 Men make sure you use a moisturizer after, best if it’s like an organic oil vitamin E. It keep the skin pretty and you won’t have that itching feeling after a few days of being hairless.
3198 2018-11-25 19:44:05 الي يفكر جذي همه الكرسي مو النادي
3199 2018-11-25 19:44:03 What a scumbag. I hope they give him some short bedsheets.
3200 2018-11-25 19:43:59 I know oil is dirty. And I get that it's polluting. But, boy, oil is also beautiful.
3201 2018-11-25 19:43:56 Yeah - we've got to fight the coal, oil and gas lobbies. Agree. Concentrate on that then instead of trying to flog a dead nuclear horse allive.
3202 2018-11-25 19:43:53 Oil and natural gas exports, along with a smaller population, and a very successful sovereign wealth fund.
3203 2018-11-25 19:43:51 Try olive oil on a daily basis
3204 2018-11-25 19:43:49 Zit? Put lavender oil on it
Stressed? Light lavender candle
Doing laundry? Use lavender soap
Dry skin? Use lavender lotion 
Diffuser? Lavender drops in that
Wax warmer? Lavender wax
3205 2018-11-25 19:43:45 Equals, Justin Trudeau is a Canada killer , destroying the Largest Industry in Canada, why can’t he see how much money oil could profit Canada
3206 2018-11-25 19:43:38 Yes you keep pointing out your mistakes, tax cuts = huge deficit that will take decades to fix. Oil prices are low = your support of a murder and blind eye to civility.
3207 2018-11-25 19:43:37 *She lies down on the sofa and I softly rub her back with warm oil massaging out the tense muscles* "Just relax Josie and know that nothing will happen to our family"
3208 2018-11-25 19:43:37 #WPPENERGY initial focus is to convert existing polluting power plants that operate on Coal and Natural Gas to run as clean and environmentally friendly as possible. Oil and Gasoline plants will be addressed at a later stage #ico
3209 2018-11-25 19:43:36 What really is this argument about? The climate is changing? Yep. What do the dems plan on doing abt it? If the whole damn country goes solar and wind and we shut down oil gas and coal? Doesn't mean shit if the world doesn't do the same. Stupid nonsense.
3210 2018-11-25 19:43:31 Family Guy is a show normalising toxic culture and I am addicted to it like unrefined coconut oil.
3211 2018-11-25 19:43:29 Well if Norway is that good just remember - it's governed by Norwegians. Sadly, the UK is governed by imbecilic Brits - no matter which party is in power. All that North Sea oil money pissed away on what exactly? Tax cuts for the wealthy? Where's the UK's sovereign fund eh? T
3212 2018-11-25 19:43:27 Oil is not just used to refine to fuel. For accessibility to markets that require it for other purposes, moving it by pipe is a necessity.
3213 2018-11-25 19:43:19 Wrong.  He's a #Narcissist #Gaslighter who dances around #Racist codewords for votes who sold out the life of a @washingtonpost journalist for a $30 discount on oil, supported by unethical people banned from their professions.
3214 2018-11-25 19:43:11 100% AB & Sask must separate we can build Oil/NG infrastructure to the US with the $11 BILLION we transferred to East Canada. Bump in revenue by tying into US would be multi Billion/year in additional tax revenue for AB & Sask provinces. No brainer
3215 2018-11-25 19:43:02 World-wide, you think this is the secret goal of the climate scientists??

Doesn't it bother you that taxpayer money is subsidizing the coal industry, and oil industry (tax forgiveness)?

So taxpayer funding is ok for which industries, according to you?
3216 2018-11-25 19:43:01  that’s very kind. But I would have to go into hiding as #thearchers twitterati wouldn’t agree with my other ideas like Canonising Nee’oil & making Lillian an advocate for AA
3217 2018-11-25 19:43:01 This argument is my favorite for the stupid.  The climate scientists are into it for money, but the oil barons are only interested in the truth.
3218 2018-11-25 19:43:00 Here's the thing...think about it like your car.... don't change the oil and it costs thousands to repair it. Spend $40.00 every 3 months and put 300k miles on same engine....not rocket science. No different for military eq.
3219 2018-11-25 19:42:58 Exactly! Not cheap 
3220 2018-11-25 19:42:55 Down turn in oil is within the context of a clear global industrial slowdown so Trump piggybacks. Stocks run up post election, he piggybacks. Stocks turn down, his messaging pivots and he piggybacks. Trump doesn’t control mkts anymore than any other president.
3221 2018-11-25 19:42:49 The Saudis are expected to hit terminal decline in oil production by what, 2030?
3222 2018-11-25 19:42:41 Follow BlazczakHomeHeating for up-to-date oil prices!
3223 2018-11-25 19:42:41 Wake UP chick.  The towers were allowed to happen as an excuse for us to go into the Middle East and take control of oil.  Do you even know what the Patriot Act is ? Read a f$&kin book.  In addition to the insane amount of $$ Halliburton and others made off the war(s). #clueless
3224 2018-11-25 19:42:40 Before you just attack " Big Oil ", you better come up with an affordable alternative. Otherwise, you'll just make everything unaffordable - including electricity.
3225 2018-11-25 19:42:35 Oil defuser..! Thats what its called.. theres all kinds of oils that do different stuff for you.. i had a teacher who would only use that for all her sicknesses and allat!!

Veterans are not asking for more than you can give. You gave a Texas oil company a handout! Approve them NOW! Cause Radar has been taking care of me all morning. There is your evidence! 

@NDP @CanadianGreens @CFNU
3229 2018-11-25 19:42:22 Pletka is a right wing think tank paid Koch girl. Expect oil industry talking points and nothing else. The question is why is @chucktodd giving her airtime.
3230 2018-11-25 19:42:18 If oil prices are falling we do not need ANYTHING from the Saudis. Is he perhaps confusing himself with “Mr. T”?  Lastly, doesn’t he have it backwards? Shouldn’t he be listening to the Federal Reserve and not vice versa? Just wondering. 
3231 2018-11-25 19:42:07 I am sure that you people know that the cost of producing the Saudi oil is the cheapest in the world ..
3232 2018-11-25 19:42:00 Ladies what should I put on my dry, itchy scalp? ( Coconut/castor oil doesn’t help) #GirlsTalkZA
3233 2018-11-25 19:41:50 You have nothing to do with oil prices #FatNixon 

But I'm sure that those who have zero understanding of how oil prices are set and who is largely responsible for setting them will be fooled and worship their #CheetoJesus anyway. 

Sad....
3234 2018-11-25 19:41:39 How about we stop subsidizing the oil industry?   Hmmm?
3235 2018-11-25 19:41:35 so i just read world crude oil is pressed bcs of new technology..... but i know some ppl who do not have & use phone & they live in the center of this town..... 
so which new technology could replace oil? 
3236 2018-11-25 19:41:26 The answer to your question, regrettably,  is: we did. We also voted for Farage and similar,  spivs, charlatans and snake oil salesmen. It is said you get the goverrnment you deserve. - Voting matters.  
3237 2018-11-25 19:41:21 I think oil sinking to $50.39 with a very real chance at going even lower plus the walls closing in on 45* might have someone lashing out...
3238 2018-11-25 19:41:18 Ok let’s try this again I meant to say
My melanin makes me feisty, I cook very WELL and  you know.
3239 2018-11-25 19:41:17 Just checked #Trump, @StateDept, @DeptofDefense twitter and nothing on Kerch Strait incident so far. We'll see if the #oil market cares in about 3 hours 20 minutes from now as I type this. #energy #nationalsecurity #KerchBlockade #KerchStrait #Kerch #Russia #Ukraine #war #WWIII
3240 2018-11-25 19:41:14 castor oil
3241 2018-11-25 19:41:11 Thc/cbd oil taste so bad!
3242 2018-11-25 19:41:07 Well if they want to bail out something the oil field should have every qualifications, the only downfall would be it’s in the west, as someone said if this oilfield was in Quebec we would have pipelines to where ever they were required
3243 2018-11-25 19:41:04 الي مو مخليه يشتغل يقدم استقاله وان استمر يكون مشارك معاهم
3244 2018-11-25 19:41:03 Typical SHITTY ‘fan’ buddy! Supporting anyone but SHITTY until the oil money came pouring in. They’re an EMBARRASSMENT!
3245 2018-11-25 19:40:58 Interessante @Raff_Perf. Avrei pensato che big oil avesse tratto benefici da trump in termini di aumento dei prezzi. Invece e' molto attento alla domanda.
3246 2018-11-25 19:40:58 대사 다 쳤어 아...
3247 2018-11-25 19:40:57 Bruh. Showed up 3hrs before my flight and tsa took my coconut oil  I’m upset.
3248 2018-11-25 19:40:57 the ass is soft. a lil jojoba oil
3249 2018-11-25 19:40:46 Price of oil is very emotional.  Don't discount the effects of low priced oil on the Russian economy. Low prices reign in Putin 
I always found it strange why the Saudi's would murder a dissident in the embassy of a foreign enemy. Makes no sense.
3250 2018-11-25 19:40:46 In light of those who endure a season of mourning or grief, Isaiah 61:3 is a good promise to hold steady with. "To console those who mourn in Zion, To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning."
3251 2018-11-25 19:40:45 @Neptune oil sa
3252 2018-11-25 19:40:43 Falling oil prices usually cause a falling stock market!  I would not take the credit for this “T”
3253 2018-11-25 19:40:36 5-1 Oil Kings after the second against GP.
3254 2018-11-25 19:40:35 We need to stop burning oil. It’s going to kill us all.
3255 2018-11-25 19:40:34 Why don’t you have a climate scientist on the panel to explain  how global climate change works...AEI is a front for oil and gas...Oh wait....too logical
3256 2018-11-25 19:40:27 Agree, but I've never heard anyone address these facts:

Lithium, like oil, is a finite resource. 

Each electric car requires massive lithium batteries.

Lithium batteries degenerate fairly quickly.

Spent batteries are incredibly toxic, creating a disposal nightmare at scale.
3257 2018-11-25 19:40:25 So now it’s “We” killed someone and not just “You” who let a murder go so we could have cheaper oil? No thank you!
3258 2018-11-25 19:40:23 أختلف معاك أخوي دسماوي فيهم ناس أشتغلوا وأدوا اللي عليهم ولكن في قرارات تكون عند الرئيس والرئيس عنده الأغلبيه يعني لو يبي يعطي جان عطاهم بس يعتمد إذا الفريق من جماعتك جان ماقصر معاهم والدليل شوف ألعاب أخري أول بأول يتم تكريمهم والسبب اللي ماسكين اللعبه من جماعته المقربين
3259 2018-11-25 19:40:23 Today the car decided it doesn't need its oil cap anymore and this evening the oven thought it a good time for it's on switch to break. Bring on Monday. I'm going postal.
3260 2018-11-25 19:40:19 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
3261 2018-11-25 19:40:08 How about you thank Canada for that Oil considering 38% of the consumption of oil comes from Canada... And not the place you give the common courtesy of a reach arounds to that butcher Journalists.... Just saying...
3262 2018-11-25 19:40:08 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
3263 2018-11-25 19:40:05 fear oil. lubricating all your fears
3264 2018-11-25 19:39:59 I believe it was Tony Benn that screwed us up on that one. He was energy secretary in 1975. Had it remained in Scottish hands and the correct taxation applied to the oil companies. Scotland would be sitting on a 2.3 Trillion GBP treasure chest. (Adjusted for Inflation)
3265 2018-11-25 19:39:59 Why should the government bailout oil and gas companies? If they cannot transition to clean affordable energy isn’t that their problem?
3266 2018-11-25 19:39:55 Days after more evidence of how catastrophic global warming is going to be to our planet and  prior to that, our economy,  you give yourself a lame nickname & tout oil prices?? OUR PLANET IS DYING. You are a national embarrassment. 38% and falling.
3267 2018-11-25 19:39:51 I don’t think anyone is weaponizing Krause’s research.  It is interesting though.  I also don’t think anyone in the industry is delusional regarding dil bit compared to oil from Texas, that’s why the WCS exists. There is a lot on the line here, jobs, economy of AB.
3268 2018-11-25 19:39:50 If he can’t oil my hair ion want him
3269 2018-11-25 19:39:41 방울 토마토를 먹고..비타민을 흡수하자..
3270 2018-11-25 19:39:39 OPEC has lost what control of the oil market it ever had. The actions of three men  Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman will determine the course of oil prices in 2019 and beyond. But of course they each want different things.@bopinion
3271 2018-11-25 19:39:36 Well oil is your best friend
3272 2018-11-25 19:39:36 Why is the olive oil green
3273 2018-11-25 19:39:34 I’m pretty sure he doesn’t even know. We have enough oil here to supply all of US needs. And our oils comes to you at around $22 a barrel. It’s heavier and needs lots of refining. But at that price you sure don’t need Saudi Arabia.
3274 2018-11-25 19:39:26 Were this happening in the Auto industry in Ont or the aerospace in Que ,Trudeau would doling out billions . The Oil industry is NOT asking for bailout , just QUIT with the road blocks & anti pipeline legislation ! JT have a personal agenda?? Perhaps?
3275 2018-11-25 19:39:14 Elon, we will never conquer Mars, replace oil and get off this planet without nanotubes.
3276 2018-11-25 19:39:10 Oil prices are falling and the stock market is tanking, October and November wiped all of 2018 gains. Take credit for that too.
3277 2018-11-25 19:39:05 Nah!!! Very accurate!
3278 2018-11-25 19:39:02 The only scientists jet-setting are the ones who cover for oil companies. My hubs used to work adjacent to a prof who wrote papers that absolved oil/mining companies of responsibility; he owned 5 Porsches and a vacation home.
3279 2018-11-25 19:38:57 Yes. Trump values the price of oil in bodies per barrel 
3280 2018-11-25 19:38:55 Oil City Elementary/ Middle School Oil City,  Louisiana
3281 2018-11-25 19:38:48 Hahahahah! Do we look cheap or what?
3282 2018-11-25 19:38:34 Liberals want to kill oil industry!!!
3283 2018-11-25 19:38:34 Hahaha! Thats how similar we are.
3284 2018-11-25 19:38:27 No one talks about #Venezuela! Not long ago, it was one of the richest countries ever. Lots of Oil, etc. Now the #Socialists have rich running the country & ordinary people are in the streets looking for rats, dogs, cats - anything to EAT!  @Ocasio2018 doesn't understand!
3285 2018-11-25 19:38:24 Falling oil prices affect domestic producers. JOBS JOBS JOBS.
3286 2018-11-25 19:38:18 Bottom line. No one President is responsible for the actions of OPEC or the oil and gas industry. Not Bush, Obama or Trump. Market conditions change over years not weeks. We need to be good stewards of our natural resources.
3287 2018-11-25 19:38:18 What would have replaced the billions of revenue that Salmond was counting on that disappeared when the oil price collapsed?
3288 2018-11-25 19:38:16 I'm gonna use my melanin to run fast, sing well and learn to cook. 

Was that racist?
3289 2018-11-25 19:38:15 I have her on anxiety meds, but I hear a lot from the vet need to be more strict, need to exercise her more, as if I'm being judged, so I took her to a holistic vet she adjusted her back didn't think the acupuncture would help cause it's so bad. So she started her on the oil,
3290 2018-11-25 19:38:07 Hi Gary, thank you for your response. I'm also truly sorry to know that you feel this way. Our prices closely track the crude oil price and we pass on reductions as quickly as we can. 1/2
3291 2018-11-25 19:38:00 The so-called “Tax Cut” was a lie, the stock market is down for the year, and the only reason the Saudis are keeping the price of oil down is to buy your silence on the murder of a reporter.
3292 2018-11-25 19:37:54 So cut the prices on gas at the pump to reflect the drop in oil by the barrel. Then tell me about the tax cut.
3293 2018-11-25 19:37:53 PA started mixing it with beat juice. It’s like instant rust on oil soaked parts. Absolutely terrible
3294 2018-11-25 19:37:52 @barrybonds78 there is another stock that trades highly correlated that's the R squared to oil , not $TPL but $DNR
3295 2018-11-25 19:37:48 i have pepper mint oil on my forehead bc of a headache, works well
3296 2018-11-25 19:37:48 BS.  13k miles in 17 months is damn near nothing.  I've got 155k miles on my 2015 Mazda and regularly drive routes that are impossible in an EV (3x+ maximum practical range, non-stop.)  First 13k miles in my Mazda required maintenance was ONE oil change, cost $25 for filter/oil
3297 2018-11-25 19:37:44 Wait did you mean changes or BHO policy?  Let me pose this question - every new policy put in place the last 2 years is the exact opposite of any BHO admin. We drill local oil, lowered tax rates, slowed regs, negotiated tariffs, all the opposition of any liberal policy.  And
3298 2018-11-25 19:37:33 @JustinTrudeau 3rd largest oil reserve in the world, losing $80M/day
3299 2018-11-25 19:37:26 Mainly where vegetable oil comes from, despite it’s unfortunate name
3300 2018-11-25 19:37:24 you: *drinks expensive wine to feel boujee*

me, an intellectual: *puts olive oil on my frozen oven chips*
3301 2018-11-25 19:37:23 Cry me a river, blubberButts. Buying media to be your propaganda arm is not "democratic". Pipelines going in Texas, no protests. Bet you are on Rockefeller Brothers Fund payola to block Canadian oil.
3302 2018-11-25 19:37:20 And an oil change... check engine light probably on too lmao
3303 2018-11-25 19:37:17 You haven’t exactly mastered the domestic oil market. I see oil rail pass by all the time. We shouldn’t purchase foreign oil. @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau #cdnpoli
3304 2018-11-25 19:37:10 Post results and recipe please.

I tried one made with olive oil
3305 2018-11-25 19:37:04 Long hot baths with lavendar oil, and hanging with my dog bingewatching @DatelineNBC and @48hours
3306 2018-11-25 19:37:04 Before I can accept you're okay now you have to make a sacrifice of one white ram, two kegs of groundnut oil and 5 kegs of palm wine
3307 2018-11-25 19:37:03 You basically just extract flavor by boiling the shit out of things with flavor (add oil for stuff that is not water soluable) and add salt/spices.

I BELIEVE IN YOU, MEGGLE.
3308 2018-11-25 19:37:02 Syrian oil fields are old marginal producers. They don't factor in anybody's calculus @FutbalAnarchy @JustinRaimondo
3309 2018-11-25 19:37:00 I have food issues. 
Days when I eat grass & a day like today when I wanted oil dripping from my food. Different story, I only was able to gulp 3 bites of that chole bhature
3310 2018-11-25 19:37:00 We must remain in power with the oil bloodlines of the world !  Rake the forests and deny climate change !  #sheeple
3311 2018-11-25 19:36:47 They've been investing in all sorts of delaying tactics for decades... climate denial, electing right wing wackjobs that'll do their bidding, anti solar campaigns...this is no different... it's pennies to them and needs to be ACKNOWLEDGED! This is the REAL FIGHT! Big Oil...
3312 2018-11-25 19:36:43 Yo, Donnie, if gas prices go lower the oil folks in Texas are going to start laying off workers. Look this up Mate - Cause and Effect. Now, hit that back nine.
3313 2018-11-25 19:36:33 Well sure, if he kills enough people; and there seem to be no impediments to that, as long as he keeps oil prices down and buys US weapons (or more likely, maintains personal debt owed to him by Trump)
3314 2018-11-25 19:36:30 Por dios que hermoso
3315 2018-11-25 19:36:25 Carols daughter and coconut oil really changed my life 
3316 2018-11-25 19:36:21 WTI chatroom (pre-open) update #OOTT #natgas :  Debate rages about oil and gas speculators use of Old Farmers Almanac (by Robt. B Thomas) for "Pluto" days and how Ohio Valley utility gas buyers use dates of "last frost" to not answer the phone when swing gas sellers call
3317 2018-11-25 19:36:20 Why do you try to join the issue of French oil price protests with your agenda?
3318 2018-11-25 19:36:05 4 Step process sis !! 
1. Oil/Condition
2. Leave in conditioner 
3. Cream Moisturizer 
4. Curl Gel to top it off!! A Dryer will be your best friend too
3319 2018-11-25 19:35:56 A friend told me they are also making a killing on Canadian heavy oil. Upgrading and exporting at world price. Oh well.
3320 2018-11-25 19:35:51 The Arctic will melt and they can drill for oil.
3321 2018-11-25 19:35:40 Only a nimrod like you would brag about causing a global economic downturn resulting in lower oil prices and inflation actually is way up thanks to you.
3322 2018-11-25 19:35:39 The companies you're referring to aren't the Arcs or the Peytos. The majors do that. The biggest of big oil. There are 3 Canadian producers capable: Suncor (has some), Husky (has some) and CNRL (too cheap, made the taxpayer build them one instead). We're running in circles here
3323 2018-11-25 19:35:37 If this industry cannot support itself or adapt the new tech ,why should we support them financially. Get a new job .government doesn’t help my oil industry. And my industry makes money who actually just bought out these imbeciles so you sock puppet .Not sure how your confused
3324 2018-11-25 19:35:37 Let your faith be stronger than your struggles. 
3325 2018-11-25 19:35:31 I just for men the fuck out of my beard. Too grey for me, especially when my hair isn't following suit. Other wise, beard oil or balm, condition it like your hair and prepare to itch for the first couple of weeks.
3326 2018-11-25 19:35:29 What in heaven's name did you do to decrease oil prices? Fellate MBS?
3327 2018-11-25 19:35:23 No way, get a grip.  The coal and oil founding of politicians is the main problem.  Wake up
3328 2018-11-25 19:35:19 king baby oil . Thank you prez
3329 2018-11-25 19:35:16 They couldn’t give two shits as long as big company’s that burn and profit by fossil fuels keep on making big profits expec after the tax cut for corporations/companies.
The US is now producing more oil now than any other country, with the amount of oil in the Texas Basin..
3330 2018-11-25 19:35:10 So I always get asked how I get my eye brows so thick so here it is lol: 
1. Take an old mascara brush (clean it off)
2. Dip it in some black castor oil 
3. Comb that through your brows every night (it works on lashes too)

RT to save some brows 
3331 2018-11-25 19:35:07 We were told it was the only way to stay IN the EU, we were told that EU nationals would be sent him if YES won, we were told oil would run out I  5 years. About as honourable as the £350m a week for the NHS...
3332 2018-11-25 19:35:06 Thank you President Trump for falling oil prices.  I know how hard you worked to make that happen.  I assume you did something otherwise why would you be bragging.  And thanks for it being sunny today too.   Can you make stocks go up tomorrow too?
3333 2018-11-25 19:35:01 ...grind Ur oil wheels well..@RideOrDie7474
3334 2018-11-25 19:34:56 BTW most of our imported oil comes from Canada. And great article on Newsday today about the cost of heating oil, gas, and electric is going UP. Us poor folks are screwed!
3335 2018-11-23 23:59:58 What about Palm Oil ?
3336 2018-11-23 23:59:50 So it took #oil 1 year to go from $59.35bbl to $86.65bbl and only 7 weeks to fall from $86.65bbl to $59.35bbl.
3337 2018-11-23 23:59:50 Ignore oil. It’s not part of my calculation. (But you’ve got to be kidding if you don’t think we have rights over our waters and the taxes that come from them...)
3338 2018-11-23 23:59:50 #SpoonieTips It's that time of EAR again (lol)-- ear infections. My doc once told me to use a small amount of coconut oil inside the ear to help pain + itchniness bc it's a natural antiseptic. This has helped me way more than once. Just be careful not to push too hard/far in!
3339 2018-11-23 23:59:49 Lol things I like to hear, they can keep the oil.
3340 2018-11-23 23:59:30 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
3341 2018-11-23 23:59:22 i only have ONE tea tree oil foot soak left.  someone go grab it plz
3342 2018-11-23 23:59:18 Making an apple cake from scratch. Ran out of vegetable oil so I substituted with more rum. Still should work right?
3343 2018-11-23 23:59:17 Because America places outsized demands that affect the whole world. We’re BIG consumers. 
We want cheap goods, China expoits labor & ignores the environment to produce them. We like processed foods, they burn down rain forests in SE Asia to produce palm oil.
3344 2018-11-23 23:59:12 Yes, but oil companies are more important than mankind.
3345 2018-11-23 23:59:08 They will just tweak the level of panic regarding climate change for a few years while Big Oil/Energy companies get in position to be the companies that design infrastructure and products of the sun-dimming industry. They get paid either way, especially as long as they own pols.
3346 2018-11-23 23:59:04 Who remembers when you could go into Carabbas and when they brought the Bread they would just leave the oil and herb so you could pour your own....oh the good ol days
3347 2018-11-23 23:58:55 Theres was a breakthrough on the equipment used to drill oil and now the US is the leading supplier in oil plus the us is on track to produce more oil by 2023 then they ever have.
3348 2018-11-23 23:58:55 Could lower oil prices help global growth in the ST?
3349 2018-11-23 23:58:47 At the current rate of production, and with the proven oil reserves world wide, there will be 53 years of oil supply left. Not long, but not dead yet either.
3350 2018-11-23 23:58:47 Great leaders & great nations around the world  has condemned the Saudis&their criminal crown prince for killing kashoggi&cutting his body in pieces( pictures on internet),but mr trump praising the criminal prince for cheaper oil. What a shame,Thanks god mr trump is not America
3351 2018-11-23 23:58:42 And let's not forget we are producing more oil than Saudi Arabia just another distraction another con he wants a tower in Saudi Arabia so America has to pay
3352 2018-11-23 23:58:39 Said to Bella earlier today. I’m sure some geniuses can put it to good use in inventive ways rather than carry on giving it away because of timing. The oil and gas industry are not going to stop drilling any time soon.
3353 2018-11-23 23:58:39 .Astonishingly, Canadian mainstream media, tv, print, web etc and politicians howl & weep from their fainting couches about 'Alberta's oil crisis' without mentioning the word 'dilbit' - they talk of 'oil trains' 'crude pipelines' 'oil patch exports' 'unfair discounts' though
3354 2018-11-23 23:58:36 Stupid oil , teach me to gamble on PM trudope to do something smart looks like they are going into strong survive mode when bottom hits and it will be close it should bounce . Might need a conservative government though before that happens
3355 2018-11-23 23:59:58 What about Palm Oil ?
3356 2018-11-23 23:59:50 So it took #oil 1 year to go from $59.35bbl to $86.65bbl and only 7 weeks to fall from $86.65bbl to $59.35bbl.

3361 2018-11-23 23:59:22 i only have ONE tea tree oil foot soak left.  someone go grab it plz
3362 2018-11-23 23:59:18 Making an apple cake from scratch. Ran out of vegetable oil so I substituted with more rum. Still should work right?
3363 2018-11-23 23:59:17 Because America places outsized demands that affect the whole world. We’re BIG consumers. 
We want cheap goods, China expoits labor & ignores the environment to produce them. We like processed foods, they burn down rain forests in SE Asia to produce palm oil.
3364 2018-11-23 23:59:12 Yes, but oil companies are more important than mankind.
3365 2018-11-23 23:59:08 They will just tweak the level of panic regarding climate change for a few years while Big Oil/Energy companies get in position to be the companies that design infrastructure and products of the sun-dimming industry. They get paid either way, especially as long as they own pols.
3366 2018-11-23 23:59:04 Who remembers when you could go into Carabbas and when they brought the Bread they would just leave the oil and herb so you could pour your own....oh the good ol days
3367 2018-11-23 23:58:55 Theres was a breakthrough on the equipment used to drill oil and now the US is the leading supplier in oil plus the us is on track to produce more oil by 2023 then they ever have.
3368 2018-11-23 23:58:55 Could lower oil prices help global growth in the ST?
3369 2018-11-23 23:58:47 At the current rate of production, and with the proven oil reserves world wide, there will be 53 years of oil supply left. Not long, but not dead yet either.
3370 2018-11-23 23:58:47 Great leaders & great nations around the world  has condemned the Saudis&their criminal crown prince for killing kashoggi&cutting his body in pieces( pictures on internet),but mr trump praising the criminal prince for cheaper oil. What a shame,Thanks god mr trump is not America
3371 2018-11-23 23:58:42 And let's not forget we are producing more oil than Saudi Arabia just another distraction another con he wants a tower in Saudi Arabia so America has to pay
3372 2018-11-23 23:58:39 Said to Bella earlier today. I’m sure some geniuses can put it to good use in inventive ways rather than carry on giving it away because of timing. The oil and gas industry are not going to stop drilling any time soon.
3373 2018-11-23 23:58:39 .Astonishingly, Canadian mainstream media, tv, print, web etc and politicians howl & weep from their fainting couches about 'Alberta's oil crisis' without mentioning the word 'dilbit' - they talk of 'oil trains' 'crude pipelines' 'oil patch exports' 'unfair discounts' though
3374 2018-11-23 23:58:36 Stupid oil , teach me to gamble on PM trudope to do something smart looks like they are going into strong survive mode when bottom hits and it will be close it should bounce . Might need a conservative government though before that happens
3375 2018-11-23 23:58:33 I'm gonna have to look into them. I love homemade wings, but the oil is a giant pain in the ass.
3376 2018-11-23 23:58:22 I'm waiting on black Friday deals for tires and oil changes lol  
3377 2018-11-23 23:58:13 What is it about the glow of olive oil on onion? Incredible.
3378 2018-11-23 23:58:11 You on the oil again?
3379 2018-11-23 23:57:50 People who don’t “believe” in #employerbranding tend to have the same argument: candidates only care about $€£¥, and thus “employer brand” is a bunch of snake oil.
3380 2018-11-23 23:57:31 I think it was the lower oil price because of them, but still inexcusable.
3381 2018-11-23 23:57:29 We’ve made our best selling High Potency Night-A-Mins Creams even better. Offers the same benefits, texture, and essential oil blend you have always loved, just with updated technology and ingredients.  We hope you'll give it a try!
3382 2018-11-23 23:57:17 No matter how many tutorials I see for essential oil perfumes, @EVEEEEEZY  is the best. Hands down, no contest.
3383 2018-11-23 23:57:17 @Iromg Don't let him forget the diesel fraud, the wood shavings in the oil tank, the reversing of the speedometer, the dodgy car he sold that broke down a mile down the road...
3384 2018-11-23 23:57:12 But can you get an emergency drone delivery with Pizza, Vodka and CBD oil?
3385 2018-11-23 23:57:07 That's where you win with this comment. Due process has nothing to do with the government illegally seizing, liquidating, and using the finds of a major oil company as they desire. This is the kind of behavior of communist parties.

3387 2018-11-23 23:56:56 Halo kak aku sendernya hehe. Kalo kakak pake bio oil yang mana ya? Makasih
3388 2018-11-23 23:56:45 I have an extra $200 a month (at least) since I'm not buying gas. And once EVs penetrate the market sufficiently, the price of oil will plummet.
3389 2018-11-23 23:56:41 Actually only 30 people have actually resigned from the administration, but facts and idiots are like oil and water. They never mix well. #DRAINTHESWAMP
3390 2018-11-23 23:56:32 En dos días a mi viejo le chorean un tanque lleno de gas oil y al otro camion se le corta el embrague y casi termina con 50 autos encima, que es eso de la suerte? Se come?
3391 2018-11-23 23:56:30 Is crude oil is heading to 26USD per barrel? Ready for hiking inflation.
3392 2018-11-23 23:56:30 If you all have never played with a Miwa, stick a key in bottle of vegetable oil and turn the key left and right. That’s about how smooth they are.
3393 2018-11-23 23:56:27 Interesting thought. Oil Need points, so Kosk should be in. However, LA may be the exact kind of team Talbot needs to play against to rebuild confidence. Who do you play?
3394 2018-11-23 23:56:03 Rothschilds are always around..particularly their money.Soros is the front man..same system everywhere.Soros foundations influence politics, undermine religions,support drug and gun running weakening societies..then Rothschilds use Soros foundations to scoop up resources & oil.
3395 2018-11-23 23:55:47 Moronic comment, demand for oil globally continues to grow but because of our backwards policies it will be countries like Saudi Arabia that will benefit and not Canada.
3396 2018-11-23 23:55:36 Sanctions or not Venezuela has the worlds biggest oil reserves and should not be in the mess its in. That lies squarely with Corbyns heros - Chavez and Maduro.

3399 2018-11-23 23:55:07 yes please. i had this shirt as a kid. my mum refused to buy me the home shirt because it was 2 quid dearer. i only got to wear it once because i fell in the driveway of my house and got car oil all over it. ive never recovered from the trauma of it.
3400 2018-11-23 23:54:47 you could have said oil  why did it have to be lube

was oil discovered in 1707?
3404 2018-11-23 23:54:12 all of those dandruff shampoos are scams the only real cure is coconut oil 
3405 2018-11-23 23:54:05 Oil and loud

3407 2018-11-23 23:54:00 Still import Saudi oil.... that’s what we’re doing!!
3408 2018-11-23 23:53:47 The Mayor of Caster Oil?
3409 2018-11-23 23:53:45 Hey Teri, don't think its our job.  But I agree with Dave, cut off the oil and perhaps maybe use our own...
3410 2018-11-23 23:53:36 I have a question? Do you use palm oil? Is every step and every ingredient really cruelty free 100%? I have read youbuse palm oil?
3411 2018-11-23 23:53:35 What we know is the oil conglomerates in the Midwest have been over producing, driving down cost... this is a problem created by their industry, and exacerbated by both liberal and conservative failure to build a pipeline to get oil out to the coast. Plenty of blame to go around!
3412 2018-11-23 23:53:34 of course we can. Free energy is a reality, and it would be available for everyone if the big oil/gas companies didn't have the power and the control they have rn
3413 2018-11-23 23:53:27 Why not cease the assets of Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg etc because their companies use automobiles and oil products in running their companies...
3414 2018-11-23 23:53:26 You guys are a fucking joke. Energy policies are ridiculous and the price of oil for Canada is proof. Who in their right mind thinks bleeding 80 million a day is a good thing.. lost my vote.

3416 2018-11-23 23:53:10 It’s not about oil. It’s about the entire Trump family lining their own pockets. PERIOD.
3417 2018-11-23 23:53:08 If he doesn't know what Twitter is, how can he possibly lead us into a future where countries are talking about smart cities, renewable energy and a future where the use of crude oil will be outlawed?

3420 2018-11-23 23:52:52 Got in Gianna’s car, tire light on, oil change light on, oil filter light & her gas light.. man twitter ain’t lie 
3421 2018-11-23 23:52:51 I don’t care what side of the aisle you   vote on, losing 80 Mill/day of oil revenue is asinine
3422 2018-11-23 23:52:36 If our gov't/society was sane we'd array incentives to move off oil to renewables in a decade. We could do it. We won't because enough of our politicians represent oil execs and not 'the people.' But keep defending oil Barons, I'm sure they appreciate it.
3423 2018-11-23 23:52:34 i love slapping oil in my hair like drink up bitch
3424 2018-11-23 23:52:25 All Politicians In Scotland Owe It To The Voters To Demand An Oil Fund Be Set Up Immediately To Stop All The Revenue Going South And For The Greater Part Of It TO REMAIN IN SCOTLAND TO BE USED TO END POVERTY 
THAT IS WHAT MUST HAPPEN 
SNP GET IT DONE YOU ARE THE MAJORITY PARTY
3425 2018-11-23 23:52:24 If US Oil Producers want some love from @RealDonaldTrump, they should try hacking an election or chopping up a journalist.
3426 2018-11-23 23:52:22 Not in the playoffs. besides, he’s leaking oil defensively. It’s time
3427 2018-11-23 23:52:20 Literally  I was really embarrassed I went to the dealership y los estaba regañando thinking it was the second time they didn’t put the oil correctly in my car 
3428 2018-11-23 23:52:13 Oil companies should be pretty psyched about it.
3429 2018-11-23 23:52:09 Still trying to figure out how we Canadians are a national security issue to the USA. How we sell you 40% of the oil you consume but hey fuck Canada and love the Saudi’s. Can any Republican explain it. And I am a Conservative here in Canada

3438 2018-11-23 23:50:46 And the Germans want to sell us cars...French want to sell us wine......Spanish want us to holiday there....Italians olive oil. and  the EU bureaucrats have taken a leaf out of the Greeks’ book and want to sell us a Trojan Horse for £39Billion. Let’s deal again.
3439 2018-11-23 23:50:36 The Saudi alliance is beyond oil. Despite recent news, the Kingdom is headed towards a very good direction, they have the youngest population in the world (70% are under 30) and most are western educated now. Their Wahabbist elements are being actively rooted out, and they are...
3440 2018-11-23 23:50:33 Oil is over.
3441 2018-11-23 23:50:24 You're absolutely right. But it's almost impossible to expect every individual to clean up their act when
1) oil companies have been spending millions of dollars in misinformation campaigns and lobbying for decades
And 2) the staggering majority of pollution comes from companies
3442 2018-11-23 23:50:16 Yes with garlic and olive oil
3443 2018-11-23 23:50:07 Yeah stop digging up the oil sands
3444 2018-11-23 23:50:06 Subsidized oil industry would be fair then!!
3445 2018-11-23 23:50:02 didn't expect a 3 handle close - I remain bullish - but mkt SUX, oil crash and stock leadership broken-seems overdone....

3447 2018-11-23 23:50:02 I make the pancake mix in the old “More From Less” cookbook. 6 cups flour (I use 2 c whole wheat and 4 cups white), 2 cups powdered milk, 6 T. baking powder, 6 T sugar, 1 T salt. To make pancakes, use 1 1/2 cups mix, 1 egg, 1 T oil, about 1 cup water or more as needed. Supergood.
3448 2018-11-23 23:50:02 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
3449 2018-11-23 23:49:53 parents are really naming their kids “sage” like they bought a house and need to rid spirits. SAD. very unoriginal! can’t wait to name mine “essential” and “oil”
3450 2018-11-23 23:49:51 the govt revenues from oil collapsed and have not recovered to previous highs. recent discoveries have changed nothing. 

meanwhile scotland has had an extra £50bn to spend on public services due to being in the uk union since 2014

3453 2018-11-23 23:49:16 I was walking around Walmart waiting for my oil to get changed and I had an idea...gas stations should hop on the Black Friday train! I’ll wake up at 3 in the morning if gas was $1 a gallon!

3455 2018-11-23 23:49:13 That’s an awful idea. Developing countries need oil and gas to compete. In fact, the fossil fuel industry has positively impacted millions of people by taking them out of abject poverty and giving them access the modern conveniences
3456 2018-11-23 23:49:10 Oil prices should be a holiday observed.
3457 2018-11-23 23:49:10 Oil prices should be much lower based on supply. America is back. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U!
3458 2018-11-23 23:49:08 Harper cutting GST added 14 billion to our deficit every year. How is that good? Harper (and Kenney) single-handedly stopped investment in small oil co's? How is that good? Harper left us 158 B more in debt than when he started. How is that good?
3459 2018-11-23 23:49:07 my entire medical team advised various supplements including fish oil and were like “it might help and it won’t hurt. so go for it” which i think is the official position

3461 2018-11-23 23:49:05 I believe oil will enter its final death spiral in the late 2020s to be replaced by solar energy & electric vehicles. So with less than a decade to go till the end of economic viability for the petro-economy; it is time for the West to return to its own Enlightenment Revolution
3462 2018-11-23 23:48:52 Burgerfi has signs inside every restaurant clearly stating they use 100% peanut oil
3463 2018-11-23 23:48:47 Do you know the device you are using to type this idiocy and all it's periphery is manufactured with oil? Just wondering if you know the irony levels you reached.
3464 2018-11-23 23:48:43 I’m in Cali right now, and I can attest to it lol. Oil is the new gold. Flower is losing its value
3465 2018-11-23 23:48:42 There were many voices but most were in favor of oil/gas and pipelines being built and Postal workers seeking a new contract
3466 2018-11-23 23:48:34 Trump must be thanked for playing it smart with oil producers and helping bring down prices.

3470 2018-11-23 23:48:06 IDR leading the regional currencies, is due to the fact that the CAD burden is heavy on oil. As oil declined, the much relieved balance sheet is soothing for investors. And this is outweigh the dollar index that still high.
3471 2018-11-23 23:48:00 Haha yea a pot or tall pan is better so you can put more oil to fry. I’d say about 1.5inch of oil is good for frying
3472 2018-11-23 23:47:57 You're right, why would they. Hence the importance of getting TMX going. Keep in mind that just a few years ago the Harper Conservatives were selling that status quo. Begging for Keystone XL, flogging "ethical oil". How things change.

3475 2018-11-23 23:47:38 What I was asking was if the GP's  medical assessment was that the patient was benefitting. For example, Versatis is not snake oil, it is a licensed product but not for OA. What does patient -centred care mean if their experience does not matter? Is it just empty words?
3476 2018-11-23 23:47:27 My Black Friday. Needed new pants for work. Went to Kohl’s. Checkout line wrapped around entire store. Tried some on for size.

They have invaded places before for less.... plus we have oil  seriously tho, we need real leadership, Winston Spencer Churchill must be spinning on his bald head at the current situation

They seem important right now in looking at the hit specifically to royalty calculations given WCS discount.

3494 2018-11-23 23:45:13 Can I go take a long shower and wash the oil out of my hair.
3495 2018-11-23 23:45:06 That’s part of the problem, people think it’s our energy sector, it not.  It’s believed that oil has a future and some politicians capitalized on perpetually selling the idea it has a future rather than encouraging people to retrain. The smart ones already have new jobs.
3496 2018-11-23 23:45:01 Braise the beef very well- allow space for each piece in the olive oil - then place on a plate as you go to saute the vegetables in the same fat after- this may take nine or ten batches the secret is every side must be browned
3497 2018-11-23 23:44:59 Maybe we should stop selling the U.S. our oil?

3499 2018-11-23 23:44:51 For oil, *four consecutive weekly* closes below its lower bollinger band. Would love to see some data on how often that's happened before and what happens next. $WTIC

3501 2018-11-23 23:44:38 Alaska has oil so of course it used to be warm - now cold and maybe warmer again. Let’s just pledge to keep our carbon footprint no higher than Al Gore’s or former Pres. Obama’s.
3502 2018-11-23 23:44:21 Don’t worry, big oil is engineering its obsolescence.
3503 2018-11-23 23:44:07 @netflix Please don't do a #GOOP show. Goop is full of not only bad "medical" advice but potentially harmful advice. Do better for your customers. Let her peddle her snake oil elsewhere.
3504 2018-11-23 23:44:01 I think I wanna use oil paints for this piece.. but it be my first time

3507 2018-11-23 23:43:47 Thats part of the problem of economies failing! Greed from the oil suppliers!

3511 2018-11-23 23:43:10 When @stanCollymore doesn’t buy fuel from Arab oil states for his dogging expeditions I might reconsider my season card
3512 2018-11-23 23:43:08 He knows it’s important because people talk about gas prices, but he doesn’t know the first thing about it or how the energy markets work or what factors affect oil prices. I think he’s aware he should care, so he talks about it, but no, he doesn’t get it.
3513 2018-11-23 23:42:49 はい！美味しいです！！
3514 2018-11-23 23:42:44 Low gas prices used to make a President popular but now as @ernietedeschi says, too many places in U.S. where low oil prices will hurt, in oil states and lots of U.S. manufacturers depend on oil industry.
3515 2018-11-23 23:42:37 And now it is too late as the low oil prices cycle seems to have arrived

3519 2018-11-23 23:42:07 Well I was listening to the Face yourself album awhile ago while putting oil in my van & my neighbor stops walking & practically yells at me "do you like bts...do you know them". I was trying to pour oil in my van before answering & then I turned to her & said yes I do..+
3520 2018-11-23 23:42:02 There are plenty of countries we don’t sell weapons to.
We get11%of our oil from SA, they need us far more than we need them. We don’t need them. If *45 weren’t so enmeshed w/them in business he would probably treat them as he does Iran. Most of the 9/11 hijackers were from SA.

3522 2018-11-23 23:41:51 Facts matter. *none* of these pipelines significantly increased our capacity to deliver oil to east/west coasts. which was one of the identified needs

Sorry if I offended you.  Btw like i said earlier im not deflecting im just done talking to you about politics.
3525 2018-11-23 23:41:44 They did that in the playoffs against the oil too
3526 2018-11-23 23:41:40 @murdo_fraser  watch out for that oil field!
3527 2018-11-23 23:41:40 The OIL lost this game in the last minute of the 3rd. Let the Ducks beat them to the puck. How was that OT goal not offside? Went from behind the Ducks blue line to just over the Oilers blue line. Refs missed that one.

3536 2018-11-23 23:40:58 Build the pipeline. Sell the oil on the open market. Get world prices.
3537 2018-11-23 23:40:57 Or we can turn off the sun altogether. That should take care of global warming once and for all. And we can all go back to burning as much fossil fuel as the oil companies recommend, with no worries. Heck we may suffocate from all the fumes, but global warming will be history.
3538 2018-11-23 23:40:54 Use you carbon theft, er I mean tax to pay farmers for thier grain and ship nothing but oil until there is a pipeline.
3539 2018-11-23 23:40:52 Last I think I read that he tweeted was that Saudi Arabia gave it to us in a form of oil prices...? Kinda maybe something stupid like that?
3540 2018-11-23 23:40:50 See if using shampoo w/argan oil helps!! Also, if you use heating tools on your hair often I’d go a few days without straightening/curling it
3541 2018-11-23 23:40:38 You ever use any oil or conditioner? 

Usually its because your skin will get dry and that is what will keep it healthy and itch fee
3542 2018-11-23 23:40:31 There is no such thing as fossil fuel. Chemically impossible. Most oil wells are below the level of fossils. Google it.
3543 2018-11-23 23:40:27 1) Never mind the fed govt Premier Notley.  buy the damn train tankers & get the oil to offshore markets. bad enough Ottawa owns TM, last thing AB needs is to be at JTs mercy on train cars too. 2) incentivize producers to curtail prod give them tax benefit for shutin production.
3544 2018-11-23 23:40:21 Hard to imagine how they let that one get away. The Ducks love kicking  the Oil when it’s nearly locked up. Lucic is in a bad place, Brodziak will have nightmares after that missed 24 sq ft. #Oilers

3546 2018-11-23 23:40:17 In my analysis, it was to create € necessary for Saudi to allocate new oil sale proceeds to Bunds etc. I think post-Trump allocation of sale proceeds to $ recommenced 1 July 2017, followed by gradual reversal of Bund position now ending as at 31st December @ErikSTownsend @chigrl

3551 2018-11-23 23:39:56 Oil has been going down alot, i hope NG_F gets squeeze short and I got to short it near top. xD
3552 2018-11-23 23:39:56 You basically heat a big pot of oil and dump in whatever you want to make into the batter first then into the hot oil. The batter you mix in equal part of all purpose flour and corn starch, sparkling water and egg until thick. Personally I add 2 eggs so the batter is fluffier.
3553 2018-11-23 23:39:54 So what? What you want to say?... 
Come on lads grow up, #UKOG will get licence... Atm they can run on pedl licence till 2020, also they receive permission to do sidetrack at BB till March 2020. Ukog producing oil on daily basis and they will get production licence end of story!
3554 2018-11-23 23:39:52 Good article, this issue really frustrates me, if we did it right,AB gov book an ARO for all dvlpmnts, put $ in a holding accnt to grow, kept oil Co’s liable and have the liability covered if oil Co’s failed (insurance plan) instead we paid out 300B$ in xfer payments

3559 2018-11-23 23:39:42 Why is biodiesel from palm oil a monster ? Palm oil production is much more efficient per unit of surface than all the other oils.
It's the scale that makes it a monster, everything else will turn to one also at that scale.
3560 2018-11-23 23:39:29 Today: woke up, ate, went to get my oil changed they were busy so said no, then went to Firestone to get snow tires and they said no because my car's size tires are not available... Now I have to spend money on new rims.... And then the tires.... My day has not gone well

3565 2018-11-23 23:38:44 The price of everything you buy is governed by the price of oil, don't be naive.

3567 2018-11-23 23:38:34 Oh, certainly, I’m not saying others don’t think this election is about oil making its way to markets.
3568 2018-11-23 23:38:26 @LayronWPLG The truck that caught on fire either must have had an overheated engine, or the oil in the truck had burned.

3571 2018-11-23 23:38:09 Dear Pat... it's hard... but as it stands Scotland has no say on whether to leave the oil alone because Scotland is not an independent country.

3573 2018-11-23 23:37:55 right...now that i think on it, i think our oil company did it, not some craig's list rando. :)

3577 2018-11-23 23:37:48 Syrian oil fields were being held hostage.

The notion that Assad wanted or helped his sworn enemies, committed to his destruction, to take over his country's greatest resource (oil fields) is dubious.

When it comes to Syria it's hard to trust the MSM. They've been proven wrong.
3578 2018-11-23 23:37:43 Yeah, I've been an artist for so many years & I always share my regimens. They've seem to help a lot of my clients so I figure it could probably help with the dryness. Def my favorite go-to. Emu oil has a lot of benefits. I use it for everything. A lil goes a long way.
3579 2018-11-23 23:37:28 Oil falls 7.7%!! #SUACCF18
3580 2018-11-23 23:37:09 Hmm ok let's say we do this ... then where will our transportation come from, guess we could back to horse and carts, and what about all the products aside from fuel/gas made from the production of oil?
3581 2018-11-23 23:37:04 It has everything to do with his personal finances/his business/corruption and nothing at all to do with oil. It’s always abt him.
3582 2018-11-23 23:37:00 In other words, some oil companies planned their transport but others did not. Now @OilGasCanada whines for pipelines that the companies failed to ensure themselves. A free market would allow these companies to fail but we have to pay for a pipeline for these babies. And trains?
3583 2018-11-23 23:36:57 Brodziak cant miss that gaping cage earlier on the 2-1.  Oil need to bare down and bury the other team when they have the chance.

3589 2018-11-23 23:36:33 Trump spun Khashoggi's premeditated murder like a paid PR person. The hype about the millions Saudis spend in the U.S. & the low cost of Saudi oil will soon be dispelled.  Rep.Adam Schiff will conduct a full probe of Trump's financial ties to Saudi Arabia.
3590 2018-11-23 23:36:28 Really sad I missed this one, gunna have to start buying tickets early when the oil come to town #EDMvsANA
3591 2018-11-23 23:36:27 My 11 year old lab retriever is crippled with arthritis and on a ton of drugs (including gabapentin). Just tried to buy CBD oil for him. I was told Virginia won’t allow sales anymore.

WTF @GovernorVA?? You can’t get high from it and it’s for a DOG. But he can get GABAPENTIN.
3592 2018-11-23 23:36:26 yeah, i know it’s a thing. but it’s not our heating company doing it. their only offer was to pump the oil into our other tanks, but they are currently full, i don’t wanna wait a month…
3593 2018-11-23 23:36:26 The only downside to Scotland having their own oil is the risk of a military incursion by the USA. Is that not what happens?
3594 2018-11-23 23:36:19 I need to add that to my Civic's engine oil once I replace the burnt exhaust valve. Having 318,948 miles, it burned a quart of 5W30 oil in a day. As slow as I drive, that is bad!
3595 2018-11-23 23:36:02 I flipped from the Oil to the Sabres and although I caught Skinner’s goal, I missed whateverthehellhappened in Edmonton. 

?!
3596 2018-11-23 23:35:55 According to Charlie Munger, Warren Buffets partner, says that energy independence is crazy idea, that we (he means USA) should preserve oil/gas in ground & use other countries becos its limited resource & more valuable later. Is this what JT is doing?
3597 2018-11-23 23:35:51 Awh ok i put coconut oil on after a shower I've never tried emu oil, I'll have to order some! Thank you
3598 2018-11-23 23:35:49 Question... the USA is getting our oil at a fraction of the cost of what is is worth so why would the US organizations/groups you mention want to do anything to change the status quo? The current price differential is costing Canada and benefiting the US 80 million $ a day
3599 2018-11-23 23:35:48 Its the same with every decision Western states have made in the past few centuries. Just go back 60-70 years and see how they funded the mujaheeen in Afghanistan to fight communism, removed an elected PM in Iran and funded the Saud family (wahhabists) in Arabia because of oil.
3600 2018-11-23 23:35:33 Oil extraction costs in BP fields are now under $15 a barrel and is expected to drop to $12 a barrel by 2020. Look at the oil price and do the the math. Jimmy, you are throwing away your childrens future by believing the liars who say the oil is worthless.
3601 2018-11-23 23:35:16 As consumers we are alienated from the primary industries like mining, oil and gas, forestry and farming. I don’t think the average Canadian looks at the products they use and wonders how they came into being. Something was mined and energy was used to transform it.

3605 2018-11-23 23:34:38 I've been using the new herbal essence; it has no gluten or sulphates and I've never had more manageable hair in my life since switching. The hydrating one might do you some good as it has coconut milk and oil in it
3606 2018-11-23 23:34:37 Your children need to be burdened with Billions? Sweet. And what future are we creating for them that they wouldn’t have had? We don’t pollute. See China, Saudi, USA, you know, where we import all our oil from. Explain, what are the billions really doing? You’re a joke.
3607 2018-11-23 23:34:36 How does it compare to the oil additive
3608 2018-11-23 23:34:32 In case you didn't realize it, the world's economy is almost entirely built on oil. Everything. To replace it, you'd better come up with something better than solar panels & cars to replace it.

3610 2018-11-23 23:34:18 I thought it was going to be New York beating us if anything. I wonder how many taxes they have on the oil companies that get passed down to their citizens

3613 2018-11-23 23:34:06 No dry shampoo on hand? A bit of baby powder soaks up oil until your next shower.
3614 2018-11-23 23:34:05 In the evenings for my regimen if you're talking face.. I do an essential oil mask. I'll take some coconut oil after washing my face with warm water & moisturize. Then take a hot towel & put it over my face to let it sink in then end it with using emu oil.
3615 2018-11-23 23:34:01 Why didn't they build refineries as well? We would not have to buy oil from Saudi Arabia. @OilGasCanada failed to do its due diligence and are now whimpering about lack of market access. Well if you don't build pipelines don't complain about access. Done early you'd have access.
3616 2018-11-23 23:33:46 K. Then what do you use for your addiction to CBD oil? Lol
3617 2018-11-23 23:33:45 What actions ? Providing us with fuel, plastics, and oil ? Let's go back to horse back riding! Oh wait, horse farts cause global warming too ! Sue all the ranchers while we're at it !

3620 2018-11-23 23:33:37 Yeah I have been using coconut oil even though it can clog pores, it’s the only thing that works for me currently.

3622 2018-11-23 23:33:34 Unfortunately so much of our economy is beholden to outside interests and fluctuating markets. If we step away from resource based jobs in oil and mining and instead create stronger newer job sectors that don't rely solely on trade then we'd be able to have a stronger economy IMO
3623 2018-11-23 23:33:32 Coconut oil the scent of your body that lingers on sheets, I got a shawty who you wouldn’t  reach 
3624 2018-11-23 23:33:28 i had an oil tank decommissioned, so at least at my house, this was a real thing.

3629 2018-11-23 23:33:05 Well, as it happens we buy all of our electricity from @GoodEnergy which only buys renewable electricity. We don't have gas as there is no mains supply here. We use some oil for central heating but mostly use a wood burning stove as we're in the sticks.
3630 2018-11-23 23:32:46 Today has been such a fun and productive day! Joshua and I got our oil changed in both of the cars, got tires rotated, bought all of our Christmas decorations, and then bought our first real Christmas tree!! I love days like today 
3631 2018-11-23 23:32:44 Only have issue with the egg, looking like sacrifice to the god of  palm oil
3632 2018-11-23 23:32:39 Wait. I thought Saudi Arabia was giving us low price oil for our gasoline because they were doing the moron in chief a favor or some shit like that he tweeted. So was that a lie? Say it ain't so.
3633 2018-11-23 23:32:35 He can literally just oil up his cheeks and do the same. The envy so unnecessary
3634 2018-11-23 23:32:33 Oil plunges nearly 8% despite talk of output cut
World oil supply expected to exceed demand in 2019...Nikkei
3635 2018-11-23 23:32:31 depends whose oil you're using for lube
3636 2018-11-23 23:32:24 Ripe Plantain and groundnut oil 

And two become one
3637 2018-11-23 23:32:23 i’m just gonna rub tea tree oil all over my body til i’m healthy again
3638 2018-11-23 23:32:03 It is not that we are invisible, it's just that our votes carry no weight. Also, actions taken against western interests  mean more votes and support from fringe greenie groups and American oil interests. Of course the support of American oil interests are funneled through NGO's.
3639 2018-11-23 23:31:36 Some say oil under the seabed is the greatest untapped resource, others the mines of Mongolia... but it’s clearly all the salt from Vettel fans. There’s more of that than in all the world’s oceans.
3640 2018-11-23 23:31:35 My locs look so much cleaner when I use a spray bottle with water and a couple drops of oil to retwist vs using Shea butter. SB used to be my holy grail until build up started making my scalp itch like fucking mad
3641 2018-11-23 23:31:28 I stopped working in oil and gas after the 2008 crash. Never went back except for some contract work and will never look at it again. This province is full of self entitled, spoiled children who need a huge wake up.
3642 2018-11-23 23:31:07 They are having a 30% off sale I believe! I got the translucent powder and I’m hoping the foundation I got matches I really think it will. I have a very dry face so I bought the oil hoping it’ll help my whole makeup application process. 
3643 2018-11-23 23:31:06 I found a recipe for hot oil near silver spring...
3644 2018-11-23 23:30:53 @taylorswift13 running it down and 5ending their women or cloned women to try to get with us, lol. As if. To 5tudee, us and take and 5teal our money away. They are 5tanding around dropping oil or 5tains on our things and breaking them to try to trigg3r repairs. To rai5e our™
3645 2018-11-23 23:30:43 I tried rosehip oil on my face last night and I'm sad I don't have any of my own to keep it going
3646 2018-11-23 23:30:35 Black gold.  There’s oil in them there engine!
3647 2018-11-23 23:30:32 Great piece Gary and needs to be said, also with US flooding oil market through fracking ( looking away from all the earthquakes OKL having) a lot of this out of Trudeau hands, cdn economy is booming, jobs out there, this isn't about oil, it's an inbred hatred all balled up.
3648 2018-11-23 23:30:28 I believe that every human being deserves my respect until they do something to lose it. Justin Trudeau has done nothing to lose my respect. I also believe he could singlehandedly solve the oil crisis and half of Alberta still wouldn’t respect him.
3649 2018-11-23 23:30:26 I sure hope so!
3650 2018-11-23 23:30:22 Packing my skincare for the beach trip I always bring my @audra_james #organic #oil roller balls. They are easy to pack in your bag and perfect for your night time skin care routine. The smell of the roller balls is uplifting and relaxing. Keep your skin hydrated at the beach.
3651 2018-11-23 23:30:17 They wouldnt even let us do minor things like oil changes or brake replacements.
3652 2018-11-23 23:30:06 It amazes me how little people on the right care about the environment and taking actions to preserve it. If we don't take care of this planet, we're fucked. What if they ARE right and we do nothing? How much do gas and oil companies stand to make?
3653 2018-11-23 23:30:00 Overtime in Anaheim.

Almost a guaranteed win for the oil. 

**Almost**
3654 2018-11-23 23:29:53 It’s ok. I feel like he’s learned his lesson and we won’t have it happen again
3655 2018-11-23 23:29:43 I don't belong to anyone, my heart is heavy as an oil drum, and I don't want to be alone, my heart is yellow, as an ear of corn, and I have torn my soul apart, from pulling artlessly with fool commands...(*j.m)
3656 2018-11-23 23:29:35 More devastation unleashed on earth from oil, and not from an accidental leak but from a system designed to, those responsible need to be prosecuted
3657 2018-11-23 23:29:35 Highlight of the day: my 87-year-old grandpa talking about CBD oil he bought and said “I got me some dope.”
3658 2018-11-23 23:29:24 Alberta: "WE NEED JOBS. WE NEED OIL. WE NEED PIPELINES."

Okay. So. Alberta, what are you going to do when the oil runs out?
3659 2018-11-23 23:29:22 @dpradhanbjp
@PetroleumMin
Oil has came down drastically why petrol and diesel prices are high till now. It should be 66.00 a litre now.
3660 2018-11-23 23:29:15 Gerald Butts doesn’t want and oil.  This guy kill ain’t now he’s setting his sights on Canada.
3661 2018-11-23 23:29:15 I had such an awakening today. Establishments really use peanut oil to fry things. Had I not noticed that on the menu my friends would have had to take me to the ER. Who purposefully uses peanut oil!?!? That’s like the most common nut allergy.
3662 2018-11-23 23:29:13 @PnPCBC why should Feds ( taxpayers) subsidize corps & buy more oil by #railway cars? I’ve heard that market is so smart for decades. Why didn’t industry sort it out? Sick that #Taxpayers always pick up free market screwups! Like wall street ..
3663 2018-11-23 23:29:13 I love the Beauty Bakerie powder!!! I have the yellow and the brown one. I like their foundation also, but haven’t tried the oil. Love the single shadows you got!!! I ordered a couple from ColourPop. But, now I need to go check these out!
3664 2018-11-23 23:29:06 Russia bombed the oil convoys.

Obama's government let the networks grow.

Your account is at odds with what actually happened.
3665 2018-11-23 23:28:49 Prosecute them for what? Selling oil is perfectly legal, as it should be. And since we have not caused climate change - as change has been a constant in the 4.5 billion years before man, there is no reason to take such a measure.
3666 2018-11-23 23:28:47 Being hated in Alberta is a Trudeau family tradition, and for the same reason: screwing the province over oil.
3667 2018-11-23 23:28:46 This is a joke right?
Where are your figures from?
What are they measuring?
Where is 2014-2018?
Pipeline construction is not economically viable when oil goes from $107 to $27
3668 2018-11-23 23:28:32 How about we just stop burning oil?
3669 2018-11-23 23:28:25 So tired of the whining Albertans.  They need to ask themselves why in the boom times the govt (Cons) did not save for the bust times.  Oil is a boom and bust cycle.  That is nothing new.  Instead of blaming Trudeau, blame the province.
3670 2018-11-23 23:28:24 どうにもならないから諦めてる！
3671 2018-11-23 23:28:19 Honestly I stopped using all skincare products, all I use is micellar water, acv to tone, & oil free moisturizer.
3672 2018-11-23 23:28:12 4c at the pump maybe and until oil prices go back up*
3673 2018-11-23 23:28:03 "Even if pipelines were approved quickly, it would take three to four years to make them operational.

The hard reality is that Canada is losing vast amounts of revenues and curtailing its oil production while the rest of the world profits." So what will you do for that 4 years?

3680 2018-11-23 23:27:18 We have a hard time selling our oil from Alberta. They are selling at record low prices, we need to build those pipelines and sell ethical oil 1st.
And less oil on trains... when that goes bad it goes bad. Pipelines are much safer.
3681 2018-11-23 23:27:16 Switched from engineering to sales in January of this year, and I have shattered all previous records -

This post is a bit of a brag, but maybe could serve as something to learn from my journey in this.

I was a piping designer for 5 years in the oil and gas industry. I had…
3682 2018-11-23 23:27:10 Putin?! Assad himself was one of the top buyers of ISIS oil that the Russians loaded in their tankers and sold for $$. You really love believing every bit of Russian disinformation.

3684 2018-11-23 23:26:42 More oil = lower stock values! @POTUS you just don’t understand how the world works do you!  You are destructer-in-chief of many Americans wealth (stocks down 10% again) by getting your Saudi friends to produce more oil and drive the price down. Collusion is rife! @DisavowTrump20
3685 2018-11-23 23:26:29 I just want my whole body rubbed down in oil  can’t wait til somebody pay for me a spa day , or one of my friends go with me for a date
3686 2018-11-23 23:26:02 $AMRN should run commercials of the health hazards of fish oil supplements and put them out of business. Send all your unused fish oil supplements to Matt and Larry as Christmas presents.

3691 2018-11-23 23:25:16 More food for thought. Mining lithium only happens once. Oil mining has to happen for the life of a gasoline powered vehicle.
3692 2018-11-23 23:25:11 Run the country! Not your personal economy, guess you have a lot invested in old dying companys like oil and coal.

3695 2018-11-23 23:24:53 It's downstream refining assets and retail distribution network (Petro-Canada).  I'm not saying it won't go down at all, but the cheap oil as feedstock for its own downstream businesses insulates it much better than pure producers who are stuck with selling the raw commodity.
3696 2018-11-23 23:24:51 The bouncy ship was for nude olive oil wrestling
3697 2018-11-23 23:24:42 Yet Canada supplies the majority of US' oil to them but we are the ones getting shafted. US average gas price is $2.581 gallon or $.68 litre whereas average gas price in Canada is $1.33 litre or $5.034 gallon. Canada is getting screwed in this deal!

3707 2018-11-23 23:23:48 Don’t know and if I knew I wouldn’t say. I don’t try to predict oil prices and nobody can (if they tell you they can run away). That’s why companies hedge. But there’s no reason to panic unless you are long (you just need time then). I’m just a simple guy that buys index funds.

3716 2018-11-23 23:23:14 If POTUS TRUMP keeps the pressure for low oil prices, he’s going to BANKRUPT BOTH Iran and Russia and cause BOTH countries to implode under the weight of their own internal, social and economic problems.
3717 2018-11-23 23:22:52 People in Venezuela are tormented by the US because we can't stand it they want to own their own oil! If people there are really starving it's our fault, but don't forget a lot is exaggerated eg a picture of empty shelves from a hurricane in the US is used to prove V has no food.

3724 2018-11-23 23:22:01 And this problem will continue even if you ascend the bitumen throne. It's a matter of economics. USA is independent for oil. Fracking boom. We have no other big customer.

3727 2018-11-23 23:21:59 1) Wow, move oil in mobile pipelines! More spills, leaks and derailments. Sounds like a great idea. This is at the detriment of grains, pulses and oil seeds and any other commodities best suited to be move by rail. What, move the displaced commodities with highway 18 wheelers?
3728 2018-11-23 23:21:48 Have you noticed the price of oil? I will just leave it there.

3730 2018-11-23 23:21:34 I would have been fine with the pipeline to the east as long as it stayed away from any waterways and the oil and gas were used here in Canada. Not exported.
3731 2018-11-23 23:21:31 I translated ;-)

Yes, that flexibility has fundamentally changed the dynamics of the oil industry.

3745 2018-11-23 23:19:53 Loves the packaging.  Just seems like the taste of this olive oil would be better than a lot of the other brands.  We eat with our eyes at times.
3746 2018-11-23 23:19:51 One of the “simplest” solutions would be to stop buying fossil fuels from government run entities (i.e. Saudi Arabia) and allow oil prices to be governed by the market. Oil at a high price would incentivize a transition to other sources of energy.

3761 2018-11-23 23:18:20 I disagree somewhat - that's basically a variation on "what's good for GM is good for America" reasoning - I'd say the people who are already not working in the oil patch directly already have.  The oil patch, unfortunately, has never successfully self-regulated.

3763 2018-11-23 23:18:05 He knows the truth.  He’s in with the oil men.  Look how he sided with Saudi Arabia.  It’s all related .
3764 2018-11-23 23:17:50 Reasonable?
1. Trudeau literally bought a pipeline to ensure Albert oil gets 2 tidewater 
2. @jkenney & @AndrewScheer didn't build 1 pipeline in10 yrs while in power
3. Kenney voted against policies to get pipelines built

ALBERTANS direct your anger @ do nothing Kenney & Scheer

3766 2018-11-23 23:17:44 He has finally sat on anything with gears, anything that takes oil, etc. He’s also about to drop an obscene amount of savings on a shop - also known as a man cave ... but, alas, this means I get to regain my garage from kayaks, Harley Davidsons, Craftsman, Kubota + others.
3767 2018-11-23 23:17:44 Does this come w/ a 5 gallon jug of peanut oil.....because uhm...reasons...
3768 2018-11-23 23:17:39 Considering Trump has been working for months to lower the price of oil and his policies towards Iran and KSA as well as the production level within the USA have kept the supply of oil high. No I don't find it odd. I find it expected.
3769 2018-11-23 23:17:25 Udah nyobai segala macam cuci muka yg oil control ga mempan :(
3770 2018-11-23 23:17:19 Modifying CO2 emissions is a snake oil ruse.

3772 2018-11-23 23:17:09 I just used dry shampoo... my hair feels like i used hair spray.. i mean I KNOW ITS A SPRAY IT JUST DOESNT FEEL OIL FREE AT ALL. hm.
3773 2018-11-23 23:17:05 Stop by my store, 30A Olive Oil and I will have a bottle of the Greek Olive Oil that just won best Olive in Greece and also in NYC as best overall oil.  We are also at the Rosemary Farmers Market on Sunday.  Enjoy your stay!

3775 2018-11-23 23:16:51 and even the Iraq War was all about capital gains as it was clearly done over oil purposes. Its just money money money where its just sadly made the worst of all people! Oh and Trump also recently pulled out of the Paris agreement and is now letting anyone pollute as much (2)
3776 2018-11-23 23:16:34 Canadian Oil is produced with the best environmental standards in the World. Don't buy oil from S.A & the bonesaw Prince, Iraq, Angola & Algeria. Don't support corrupt regimes with zero environmental standards, be a hero!
3777 2018-11-23 23:16:25 ...so did anyone else know that those pipelines the natives were protesting actually did what they tried to prevent and leak’d over 200k gallons of oil?????
3778 2018-11-23 23:16:16 @Mornings9 yes it's time Australia embrassed solar energy and other sources. energy is no reuseable unless perpetually restocking itself. Once gas, coal, oil, battery life is used it's gone for ever.

3783 2018-11-23 23:15:57 The oil patch don’t like it but low energy prices is a net positive for the economy. I seen something yesterday that said some frackers can make money on $30 a barrel.
3784 2018-11-23 23:15:52 From my kids & grandkids & still allows us to have the freedoms that has been fought bleed & died for I know "It's all about the oil" well let isis or one of those groups get their ignorant hands on the oil & see what happens
3785 2018-11-23 23:15:52 By the way, low oil prices is only short therm positive.

Plus #Dove uses Palm Oil which is killing a bunch of forests &Orangutans :( for its harvesting-true story look up Palm Oil
3794 2018-11-23 23:14:56 How about we regulate the oil industry? How about we invest in renewable energy? How about we stop letting corporate greed destroy our planet? @BernieSanders @KyleKulinski can give you suggestions 
3795 2018-11-23 23:14:54 So let’s prosecute the developer and “the people who built the infrastructure” (i.e. oil companies) ?!!  They’re rich!  They must be bad people!
3796 2018-11-23 23:14:53 Not his players so they don’t believe in the oil that’s being sold
3797 2018-11-23 23:14:51 굉장히 자캐 불포러 같다
3798 2018-11-23 23:14:46 So instead of saying I would build roads, be data-driven and creative, go from micro issues to macro. Food security and supply chain hold the key to unlocking our non oil revenue. Not agriculture and power as most make us think.
3799 2018-11-23 23:14:45 @aeberman12 My full respect to you and your call that oil was overvalued two months ago.
3800 2018-11-23 23:14:41 Do you find it odd that oil is cratering in this "high demand" environment? Global demand is falling and a large-scale global recession is just around the corner.

Central banks are backed into a corner. If they halt "rate normalization" now...
3801 2018-11-23 23:14:30 I think more issues is that Alberta never diversified its portfolio outside of oil and it has had  Pc  hold for a long time
3802 2018-11-23 23:14:28 But but but, i thought all that oil was meant to run out. Didn't the Scottish media say this in 2014 
3803 2018-11-23 23:14:25 BRILLIANT! I love that, it actually is since I have to go to Morocco for REAL argan oil!

Oil, Whiskey is not just the only thing you get from Scotland
List is huge can't name it of hand
3806 2018-11-23 23:14:01 ISIS territory began to shrink the moment Russia got involved after Putin called Obama/Erdogan (among others) out over the massive oil truck convoys going from Raqqa through the Turkish border.

We tried to make Erdogan the fall guy.... now he has zero confidence in us as allies.
3807 2018-11-23 23:13:57 Cogs gets hooked on a partial break and oil go and score the other way. Typical non-call leads to an opposition goal. #RefYouSuck #EDMvsANA
3808 2018-11-23 23:13:54 Crude oil
3809 2018-11-23 23:13:53 Ah, that's interesting, thank you. Yes oatmeal is great, it has a lovely softening effect and eases the discomfort of tight dry skin. Once the fungus has been killed I bathe them with Aveeno bath oil.
3810 2018-11-23 23:13:33 2/ those with vulgar signs (a small minority)need to be called out but they don’t reflect the majority of folks in the Oil Patch. People are frustrated, scared for their jobs and angry.
3811 2018-11-23 23:13:32 I think it will produce around the equivalent of 8% of our current oil consumption. If we consume the same amount, it doesn’t affect our budget at all, right? Because we don’t count exporting oil, only burning it
3812 2018-11-23 23:13:32 Only problem with that... if we shoot those gas bags to the sun it might sniff it out like explosives in an oil rig fire.
3813 2018-11-23 23:13:21 Today folks, I will show you how to catch the kitchen on fire with a gas stove and some cooking oil
3814 2018-11-23 23:13:16 As someone who directly works in the oil field I urge you, learn how the oil field works.  Prices come down when they flood the market.  When prices are down Americans in the oil field don't work.  #DonTheCon #StableGenius
3815 2018-11-23 23:13:14 You’re in denial. Venezuela isn’t even the most oil-dependent economy, yet it’s been hit far harder than any other oil nation. And it’s all down to the socialist policies. Do you disagree that price caps are a significant cause of their economic problems, for instance?
3816 2018-11-23 23:13:06 I'm addicted to Thai food.
3817 2018-11-23 23:13:04 We have the same topography and same story. Lol. We’re in southern KS and my hubs works oil/gas in OK. We visited WA in 2013 and we’ve gone 2/3 times per year since then. We basically stopped vacationing anywhere else so it’s really become a second home.
3818 2018-11-23 23:12:51 But oil prices are dropping !
Let them drive electric cars ...
3819 2018-11-23 23:12:48 The Govt is complicit. It's not just orangutans being moved on, it's traditional owners of the land. The market could work if consumers boycotted palm oil products, but there is a market failure in terms of the information available to consumers. And the care factor.
3820 2018-11-23 23:12:40 Someone recommended a good shampoo and conditioner! And a hair oil!
3821 2018-11-23 23:12:23 But no milk all substituted by palm oil and cocoa butter and other rubbish
3822 2018-11-23 23:12:21 If her country had oil? She'd be carried in a Rolls!
3823 2018-11-23 23:12:12 So you’ll not be arsed with the squillion new barrels of oil then? That’s the thing with hope, it need never die. But if you live your everyday life bemoaning those with an optimistic bent on life, it can seem as though there is nothing to aspire to. Bless your cotton socks.
3824 2018-11-23 23:12:11 Good think here in CA we have dems replacing oil cost with > taxes!  Yah, we stupid in CA!

3839 2018-11-23 23:10:36 Not only food. What was a 20 litre can of motor oil is now 18.9. For the same price.
3840 2018-11-23 23:10:33 For the oils - 

Fats are triglycerides, a subset of lipids (where lipids are the "oil" part of oils.) If the oil has no triglycerides, it's not fatty.

3842 2018-11-23 23:10:28 The us has the world's largest army, we can "convince" anyone of anything. Or we can just bomb their coal/oil plants. 

Not that that would be necessary w/chna. If the US/Europe/Japan imposed carbon tariffs they would have to adapt or have their economy collapse
3843 2018-11-23 23:10:12 It's not enough the US is in Syria illegally and backing ISIS in Oil fields? Look on the maps where the US is in Syria.
Regime change for ALL the OIL in the world should be outlawed. Lets start renewable energy before the planet goes to hell.

3847 2018-11-23 23:09:36 The middle east is a strategically important. That importance dwindles as the reliance on oil diminishes. It's one reason we must develop renewable sources of energy. Until that reliance is abated, there will always be need to have a footprint in the middle east. 3/
3848 2018-11-23 23:09:30 A state title game that goes into OT tied 0-0. Now you just can’t make this kind of stuff up. 

Truly remarkable effort by both teams. We are in for a good finish at Lucas Oil.
3849 2018-11-23 23:09:25 on the way home from the store, I drove by a "no dumping" sign.

3856 2018-11-23 23:09:03 OVERTIME at Lucas Oil Stadium in the 4A State Championship game.

In case you are wondering what the score...

@BishopDwengerHS - 0
@CentralBearsCHS  - 0

Both teams had chances and when the Saints blocked a Bears FG attempt, it had a chance to be returned.
3857 2018-11-23 23:08:52 Imagine working somewhere that uses peanut oil for decor what the fuck is this
3858 2018-11-23 23:08:48 What was this "expert" tweeting about now? Last time he was nationalising the oil industry at no cost, all sales income going straight to Scotland, no wages paid, no expenses incurred, 100% pure profit.
3859 2018-11-23 23:08:44 Shampoo with tea tree oil. It tingles which stimulates your scalp and promotes growth.
3860 2018-11-23 23:08:43 All those unionist journos and M(S)P's wouldn't have lied, so the only explanation must be the Clair field was discovered and brought online in record time.
Who knew that it was so quick and easy to build oil rigs, float them out to sea, anchor them, drill wells and lay pipes...
3861 2018-11-23 23:08:39 What the... ! How about we start with low hanging fruit - stop allowing big oil and energy to bully us into continuing to be dependant on fossil fuels. We already have the technology, can we not find the will??
3862 2018-11-23 23:08:38 This just isn’t believable. Anyone can figure out if you increase oil on rail something else has to give, there is no more room on the rail. And at no point has your leader addressed this, she just wants it to look like she can get oil to the coast!
3863 2018-11-23 23:08:37 Still at Lucas Oil. This Dwenger/Evansville Central game is WILD.
3864 2018-11-23 23:08:21 Haha... If it's just oil n dal you can make it as a fry 
3865 2018-11-23 23:08:14 Since 2000 we have seen many bubbles. Dotcom, housing x2 , corp bonds, shale, oil, equities, commodities, bitcoin x5. There will be more.
3866 2018-11-23 23:08:07 The kick is blocked! We are going to overtime for the first time in a 4A state championship game ever! 

Still tied at 0 at Lucas Oil Stadium!
3867 2018-11-23 23:07:57 How about we just stop using oil and go with renewables. I don't want an oil spill in my backyard. Keep the damn oil in the ground in AB. It's a dying resource and the sooner we wean ourselves off of it the better.

3888 2018-11-23 23:05:34 What's wrong with coming up with something new and better than oil?
3889 2018-11-23 23:05:33 After all the shit video replay calls against the #Oil on the last few years, they finally have one go their way. You just never know when this team is involved.
3890 2018-11-23 23:05:20 After hours of freezing my ass off they're finally filling our oil tank amen
3891 2018-11-23 23:05:16 It's not just needed to fuel cars. It's needed for ships and planes to export/import goods around the world. I don't think the entire world is ready or prepared to stop using oil within 10 years. If it's a commodity other countries need to buy to survive then we should sell it.
3892 2018-11-23 23:05:12 RT:( @JimCramer): RT @carleygarner: Crude oil futures are testing support near $51.00. There is a good chance the selling dries up here (at least temporarily). This is in line with our analysis featured on @MadMoneyOnCNBC last week by @jimcramer : …
3893 2018-11-23 23:05:08 @Sandy777sea1- it’s not oil or $ receipts by the US Government it is the $ receipts by the tRump organization that matters to tRump!
3894 2018-11-23 23:05:04 Finally getting an oil change 6 months after my vehicle said it was required
3895 2018-11-23 23:05:01 I got the pen from a smoke shop that’s not hard to find. The oil is tho, somebody got it for me.
3896 2018-11-23 23:04:53 I know Trump want's a lower oil price to benefit his voters, but with huge output increases from fracking still in the pipeline, the oil price collapse could hit places like Houston especially hard.  Voters are also employees of somebody, that seems to get lost in the details.
3897 2018-11-23 23:04:46 We aren't in charge of anything. The oil industry and climate deniers are in charge.  Just keep buying their victimhood as they sell the world for a bump in they're earnings.
3898 2018-11-23 23:04:43 Yes as soon as you mentioned Baker Botts as Ted Cruz old law firm I found ties to oil gas and tax lobbying to maintain off shore accounts Cayman Islands. I tweeted out tax lobby article. I'm  not as fast as you! 
3899 2018-11-23 23:04:30 If one can they should buy a Tesla. It is the one company that has as its founding goal the ultimate demise of Oil Companies.
3900 2018-11-23 23:04:26 The shell oil co party? Was the same a couple of years ago.  I don't buy their fuels anymore.
3901 2018-11-23 23:04:24 We’re living parallel lives in another dimension, I just spent $1070 otd for mount balance of 6tires 225/75/16 10ply e rated 
2 new battery’s $120 each at Walmart and oil, alignment and front pads Tuesday
3902 2018-11-23 23:04:01 There isn't a single environmental scientist of any field who hasn't been paid by an oil company (or as you put it, spun) who says climate change isn't real and caused by human activity.
3903 2018-11-23 23:03:59 OKจ้า
3904 2018-11-23 23:03:56 Sharia law allows for monetary compensation to the family to buy their acceptance of the killing of a relative.  Fortunately we don’t have Sharia law.  I would gladly pay a premium on my fuel charge in support of an embargo on buying oil from Saudi Arabia until MBS is removed.
3905 2018-11-23 23:03:52 Hair 1x A Week. You Can Use This When You Get Out The Shower After Whatever You Do. You Can Also Use Organic Coconut Oil That’s Unrefined Cold Pressed. Another Thing I Also Used 3x A Week &’ Slept Overnight Was A Hair Oil Called Bramhi Oil. It’s Indian.  Hope I Helped Love 
3906 2018-11-23 23:03:50 Broke 2000's logic: looking at nation's with highest oil reserves and correlating with US/globalist military interest.

Woke 2020: looking at list of nation's by ethnic homogeneity.

3909 2018-11-23 23:03:46 who sold my soul to the devil bc i am sure im destined to go to hell even though i am a pure virgin olive oil
3910 2018-11-23 23:03:42 Isn't Iranian oil supposed to be of a higher quality than other countries oil.. why wouldn't you buy Iranian. Makes sense.
3911 2018-11-23 23:03:42 Toast olive oil and tomato... now that is a different matter
3912 2018-11-23 23:03:42 Oil is used for loads more than making fuel to burn  basic knowledge of chemistry is all I have and I know that
3913 2018-11-23 23:03:23 Who in hell was talking about who pays to support this family. Not me. I was talking about mental illness. Explain how signs like this belong in a protest on Alberta oil. I will stand up for those that have mental illness irregardless of last name.
3914 2018-11-23 23:03:13 Obviously magnitude of oil price decline is much smaller. Not sure we see stronger discretionary spending beta. But we shouldn’t see the same non-energy capex decline we saw in 14-16 (eg rail equipment is not in as precarious place as it was in 2014)
3915 2018-11-23 23:03:12 It's OK. EVERYTHING @realDonaldTrump says is ignorant. Did you hear the latest? Let's here it for steam! Maybe we should ask Trumpy to import steam from France & cut off oil from Saudi Arabia! Hey Donald, let's convert all cars to steam. Even Einstein says digital is really hard.
3916 2018-11-23 23:03:12 I tested this delicious skin oil I got for my mom before buying it and I’ve since spent the day trying not to sniff my arm in public like a weirdo. It smells soooo good, though!

3918 2018-11-23 23:02:59 "The economy is great" how about our buget? And that Albertan oil prices have significantly dropped? (per by bucket or whatever you call it) and you now have to pay over 4 billion dollars for a pipeline that you're not even going to build!
3919 2018-11-23 23:02:55 Pray
Are any of you suffering hardships? You should pray. Are any of you happy? You should sing praises. Are any of you sick? You should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over you, anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord. (NLT) ( James 5:13-14  )
3920 2018-11-23 23:02:46 “He got in the oil. Guarantee he got in the oil.” Gotta love DW 
3921 2018-11-23 23:02:43 Obvious Q is why does U.K. not tax same as other oil producing countries?
3922 2018-11-23 23:02:30 We're already hit with double taxation. Between oil companies passing taxes on to us and taxes being levied directly by the state we're essentially paying a buck a gallon tax

And they're hiking registration fees as well...
3923 2018-11-23 23:02:24 yall think harry puts coconut oil on his scar?
3924 2018-11-23 23:02:20 Major oil concerns have basically made the informed decision that it is preferable to them to increase and maintain profits at the cost of the Earth’s habitability, and have managed to sell big chunks of the population on the idea that this is okay. People do need to be shut up.
3925 2018-11-23 23:02:05 Why do you think they hit oil so hard?
3926 2018-11-23 23:02:04 Oil Sykes is a very beautiful man isn’t he

3929 2018-11-23 23:01:52 I think Trump's link to Russia and Saudi is all about, oil, nuclear, and concrete.
3930 2018-11-23 23:01:41 "Data from this study showed that coconut oil had the highest oxidative stability. This is due to its extremely high saturated fat content (about 92%), which makes it solid at room temperature."
3931 2018-11-23 23:01:38 Yeah. I really don't think it's right. I think @gostowl had the red with a pruned castor oil flower
3932 2018-11-23 23:01:38 They start you right off by having everyone's surname be a petroleum company, in reference to the compressed oil deposits their families will eventually become
3933 2018-11-23 23:01:23 or at least a passable trompe l'oil
3934 2018-11-23 23:01:22 I would assume given the amount of hold Russian hardware and oil that shows up there!

3936 2018-11-23 23:01:10 @realDonaldTrump While the fall in oil prices doesn't yet match the 2014-2016 slump to $26 per barrel, the current slump should soon make itself felt through the global economy. The international crude benchmark, Brent, has fallen under $65 per barrel from a four-year high in
3937 2018-11-23 23:01:04 Jamal Khashoggi life long friend and comrade of Osama Bin Laden and member of the murdering Muslim brotherhood, sowed to the wind and reaped the whirlwind. I would rather drink Saudi oil than eat lunch with the likes of
Jamal Khashoggi.
3938 2018-11-23 23:01:03 Loyalty comes a poor second behind Oil Supplies & Arms Sales in Tory Britain. Their moral compass went awol years ago.
3939 2018-11-23 23:01:01 Drill that oil!!!!
3940 2018-11-23 23:00:55 Why does US want to get involved in ancient Shia-Sunni animosity in the Gulf? Why does US always take the side of Israel even when they are agressors? Basic reason is oil and Israel is US proxy in the region.
3941 2018-11-23 23:00:45 but why jimin hair looking stiff might have to cop a few cantu repair and some coconut oil he cute tho
3942 2018-11-23 23:00:40 We have many Greek recipes - soup style (Chickpeas/beans in tomato sauce w/ spinach and olive oil) that we usually serve with sourdough bread AND feta cheese! So, I wouldn't say it's weird Depends a lot on the cheese too.

3946 2018-11-23 22:59:49 But doesn’t Denmark need oil? How will they ever survive the potential implications of this action?
3947 2018-11-23 22:59:38 Plans to? Ya mean did!! The entire Republican Party and way too many Democrats are bought and paid for by big oil (Koch bros, BP, Saudi Arabia, etc)
3948 2018-11-23 22:59:31 @TigervsPhil  ..... Charles needs to warm up NOW ..... old bones need oil !!!!
3949 2018-11-23 22:58:54 Scotland got £1.3 Billion from pil
it pays for your free prescriptions that's it. Last year it was £200 million. There's not enough to pay for your free stuff let a lone and oil fund like Norway's! Norway produces 2.5 times more oil than Scotland and cheaper too
3950 2018-11-23 22:58:54 I parboiled them before frying them, no added oil, just the fat from the bacon (some random brand, nothing fancy)

3952 2018-11-23 22:58:36 Congratulations to Peta on attempting to bully the village of Wool into changing their name, only to find out the history of the name is 'Welle', as in a water spring.
Have a week's holiday in Wool, just to annoy the snowflakes pictured here.
Hope the inks in the masks isn't oil.
3953 2018-11-23 22:58:36 The end of the night laugh with my family made my Thanksgiving 10x better. @50KaratDiamond_ slide some oil to me
3954 2018-11-23 22:58:06 US sell your excess supply of oil your tanking the West texas intermediate becuase of operating cost of your production sell at 20% profit not 50% for now
3955 2018-11-23 22:58:06 He also said have you heard about the new Claire oil field, absolutely massive and a completely new discovery
3956 2018-11-23 22:58:03 You are right about the impact of low oil barrel prices and its effect on teh industry.  People forget, there is one easy way to drop consumer gas prices to under a dollar per gallon. Open just one new full capacity Refinery in the US.  Good luck finding a community to have it.
3957 2018-11-23 22:57:59 This whole thing is about obtaining the resources under our nation: coal, oil, minerals, water, etc. Not to mention all of the middle class assets, as they've done in Russia. They are greedy oligarchs.
3958 2018-11-23 22:57:56 I live in Alberta. For decades. I did not complain about mob behaviour - though a lot of the signs were vulgar and despicable - but about the underlying lack of accurate understanding of the current reason for low oil prices and a widened differential.
3959 2018-11-23 22:57:56 How do you like the oil less fryer? I really been curious but didn't know if I would end up using it at all.
3960 2018-11-23 22:57:49 Alberta has only 1 Oil customer USA, who pay Alberta 1/4 of current market price. 
Ontario & Quebec refineries then pay USA full market price for the same oil.  Four times what we’re getting for the same oil
How the hell does that make sense 
Worldwide consumption is increasing!
3961 2018-11-23 22:57:47 They did such a good job convincing Scots via the MSM in 2014 that there was no oil left but now with Brexit on the horizon, they have placed themselves in a bit of a sticky wicket and now need to reassure the markets that they can shore up the £ - voila, rabbit from the hat.
3962 2018-11-23 22:57:41 Definitely oil companies are awful.
3963 2018-11-23 22:57:33 The funniest thing about Occasional-Cortex is she thinks she invented snake oil.
Girl, they been sellin this swamp gas for 30 years. History actually didn’t begin the day you were born. But you-B-you.
3964 2018-11-23 22:57:28 ...many producers in the US and Canada and stop as well as OPEC and Saudi included Iran as well as Russia. No one really want to see the oil price that low unless the recession only this @realDonaldTrump dumpster wants to see it.
3965 2018-11-23 22:57:24 Pleased you used the word ‘intercepted’ and not ‘rescued’, in times gone by we’d have tipped boiling oil on them, now we house them, feed them and give them everything they could ask for.
3966 2018-11-23 22:57:22 @Bicinq Understand how our economy works. Our dollar was removed from the Gold Standard in 1972. Henry Kissinger made a deal with Saudi Arabia. For protection & they Back the US Dollar with oil. Google Petrodollar- every country needs US DOLLARS to buy fuel. No dollar no fuel.
3967 2018-11-23 22:57:19 Thank you. I’ve been dealing with this for years. 3 mos ago I started CBD oil then 2 mos ago, medical marijuana. It’s helped me so much. I have a relative with Parkinson’s that encouraged me to try it, as it’s helped them so much.
3968 2018-11-23 22:57:09 While I was waiting on my cars oil change I walked to a couple stores. Home and happy I’m home now!
3969 2018-11-23 22:56:36 Because oil would leak out
3970 2018-11-23 22:56:34 Proven reserves. Also, with information coming out today and Nobel prize going towards carbon pricing science and it’s urgency, they have 10 years max, because we all have 10 years max. Oil will continue to be a resource for many more years, but at a much reduced amount.
3971 2018-11-23 22:56:34 Is the oil droplet the same size as the oil molecules?
3972 2018-11-23 22:56:21 People ARE dying and HAVE died.  I.E. Several hurricanes, typhoons, fires, etc.  It IS happening and the people with all the money are trying to gaslight us into thinking there is NO problem so they can continue to make money from coal and oil.
3973 2018-11-23 22:56:20 Just like if Norway had found oil ore 1900 they wouldn’t be  independent
3974 2018-11-23 22:56:17 we're on the same side 
I was just pointing out how djt made the lower oil prices a big win for people while in reality the oil price cuts are hurting the overall world economy
3975 2018-11-23 22:56:15 But on the other hand bay got a oil change 
3976 2018-11-23 22:56:02 Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot, in the same oil, at the same time and under the same heat conditions, But they do not all pop at the same time..My people never compete with anyone in your life ,your time will come
3977 2018-11-23 22:55:59 I think you mean oil companies.
3978 2018-11-23 22:55:51 It was a Liberal govt that got the oil sands industry moving in the first place. It was a Liberal govt that convinced a majority of Canadians we can balance the environment and energy development. It was a Liberal govt that bought a pipeline in order to move the project forward.
3979 2018-11-23 22:55:47 We know Solar is availble If it will save the world stop oil dependence likely stop the US from getting involved in the Middle East and eliminating terrorism Seems like a small proce to give us Solar panels 4 free
3980 2018-11-23 22:55:17 If it weren't for the red ones being on individual stalks/stems, I'd say it's a Ricinus communis, ie castor oil. But the stems.
3981 2018-11-23 22:55:14 It’s like clockwork. And the really funny thing is that at this point, they’re not drawing in new crowds of converts to whatever snake oil cart they’re pushing, they’re just ranting to their buddies and people who’ve already drunk said snake oil about things they don’t like. And-
3982 2018-11-23 22:55:13 Yes it is Corporate voodoo to protect lithium mining runoff and cobalt mining as opposed to oil and coal
3983 2018-11-23 22:55:10 ...pan alone. So my ingredients were ready and the pan was hot as fuck and I poured the oil is  and it started sizzling and sizzling and popping everywhere and then i took it off and then the oil started popping onto the stove and then a fire started but it was there for...
3984 2018-11-23 22:55:07 The only thing virgin about u is your olive oil 
3985 2018-11-23 22:55:03 this presidency and destroy our environment in the process. There’s no such thing as clean coal, oil or gas. There were no jobs created in the coal industry. We all should have green roofs, solar panels and small wind powered generators powering our homes, just to start.
3986 2018-11-23 22:55:03 It turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for #Alzheimer's disease.
3987 2018-11-23 22:55:03 Btw, you can substitute any oil for butter, and season as you like. You can also change ingredients to make any cream of... Soup. I prefer using gel stock because it has more flavour than canned. Or make my own/store bought roast chicken.  Best of luck!
3988 2018-11-23 22:54:59 and Arabs stop selling oil to Denmark.
so what?
3989 2018-11-23 22:54:58 Why do you think $SU would not be particularly harmed by a much lower oil price?
3990 2018-11-23 22:54:52 Turkey fried in peanut oil sounds lush Im up for that this Christmas
3991 2018-11-23 22:54:51 Vox: double hulled oil tankers eliminate (oil spill cleanup) jobs!!!!
3992 2018-11-23 22:54:48 Harper Gov built 4 pipelines during its 9 years. All went somewhere (albeit not tidewater) but they actually transpor Oil. PM Dressup clown has sabotaged a number of critical pipelines( Northern Gateway,Energy East),purchased one for 4.5 Billion dollars and built ZERO.Use Facts.
3993 2018-11-23 22:54:28 try coconut oil or clinique take the day off balm

3996 2018-11-23 22:54:11 Finally purchased CBD oil and gummies. Let’s see how it works.
3997 2018-11-23 22:54:10 Global demand for oil is going up. It recently crested 100 MMbbl per day.
3998 2018-11-23 22:54:09 Our planet can no longer absorb or ignore the amount of plastic, the oil spills, the toxic water & air,due to overpopulation of G.O.P./climate change deniers.
3999 2018-11-23 22:54:08 I found a new body oil. I’m about to be glistening. I rebuke dry skin.
4000 2018-11-23 22:54:07 Corporatist understand supply and demand. 

We are competing against fracked oil. The price isn't going to go up.. And producing more isn't going to bring the price up.
4001 2018-11-23 22:54:05 Yes in the oil department
4002 2018-11-23 22:53:55 @rhysmorgan heard you fancied a scrap with me, bring it. Rural rules, Speedos and covered in baby oil. One v one winner takes all. I will defeat you.
4003 2018-11-23 22:53:39 Welll, i was trying to make a stir fry right. So I was trying to be really professional about it & I heated up the span when I was almost done prepping my ingredients. But I didn’t know that you should heat up the pan with the oil rather than me being stupid and heating up the...
4004 2018-11-23 22:53:30 Should be Imported Oil. We produce over 40% of our own oil.
4005 2018-11-23 22:53:24 My fashion style is whoever controls the oil tankers in post WW3 America.
4006 2018-11-23 22:53:23 When our dog has a tick, my wife puts baby oil on the tick, removes the tick and cleans with peroxide.
4007 2018-11-23 22:53:21 Who are right now fighting for the Oil companies across the US. Start with Colorado if you think it isn't true. Which Dems are against fracking? They won't take it out of their platform. If you think they will actually lift a finger against their donors you're sadly mistaken.
4008 2018-11-23 22:53:21 Y’all oil y’all face before applying primer or makeup?
4009 2018-11-23 22:53:20 ตัวอยู่ตรงไหน ตอนนี้เรารออยู่หน้าประตู ตรงสะพานลอย
4010 2018-11-23 22:53:05 We get most of our oil from Canada and are producing hugh quantities on our own.We don't need the monsters.
4011 2018-11-23 22:52:36 yesterday was a bad back day.  did a few stretches throughout the day, took extra dose of my CBD oil and also rubbed it on vertebrae in my neck and back.  by the end of the day, compete relief and slept like a baby.
4012 2018-11-23 22:52:28 Why asking me if I have a solution? I am not even talking about that. If you want a solution, ask your representative, that is why they are elected, and most importantly, a representative that does not take campaign contributions from oil companies
4013 2018-11-23 22:52:25 ありがとうございます！
よろしくお願いします
4014 2018-11-23 22:51:59 God and government DO NOT go together, EVER. Like oil & water, they separate...and they separate people to the point of violence & hate.
4015 2018-11-23 22:51:59 ...US oil production hit a record high since 2017 and less depending on Saudi Arabia. 2018 the US importing only 9% oil from Saudi and 40% from Canada. 
The oil price staying above $50 range many producers able to maintaining profits. However, if it fall below $40....
4016 2018-11-23 22:51:59 did Lyle change his oil recently?
4017 2018-11-23 22:51:57 CBD oil acts on THC to neutralize the effects. If you have delivery service or a dispensary, you can get some and they can probably tell you how much to take.
4018 2018-11-23 22:51:55 What if he’s an under cover pro oil pro climate genocide person you don’t know these days. They have code language you know  
4019 2018-11-23 22:51:51 I’ll be on @PnPCBC this evening chatting about all things oil-by-rail.

4027 2018-11-23 22:51:23 A drop of olive oil and lemon juice to an ice cube then running it over your face gives you better results than some most skin care products
4028 2018-11-23 22:51:16 Did you see the recent-ish ad campaign for CPAs? Accountants on oil rigs and steel refineries etc. It showed business all the different ways it could use accountants and showed students that they could dre bigger than tax returns. We need a similar campaign for architecture.
4029 2018-11-23 22:51:12 Lower oil prices? Only cost us an arm and a leg. Correction: 2 arms and 2 legs. At this point, Harvey Weinstein has more #MoralAuthotity than our Nation. . #UnfitToBePresident #ethics #Saudi
4030 2018-11-23 22:51:11 Every time I drink my olive oil.
4031 2018-11-23 22:51:06 Yeah, it removes the floating olive oil on top of the cheese. (I don't like the taste of olive oil).
4032 2018-11-23 22:51:02 Thank goodness y’all all out Black Friday shopping or whatever. I’ve never had a faster dealership experience. In and out with the oil change and tire rotation
4033 2018-11-23 22:50:54 "Everybody's going to get hit," said Cole Frederick,
co-founder of Peak Land Services, which helps oil companies
acquire properties in Texas shale fields. He noted, however,
that November's price is well above the lows that put hundreds
of smaller companies out of business in '16

4035 2018-11-23 22:50:34 You scored a spectacular self-goal by linking the proof that you knew about the Shetland oil fields since 2011 and yet were quite happy to jump on the "Nats Conspiracy theorist" Bandwagon. If anyone was in any doubt that the BBC is corrupt propaganda outfit, you've just proved it

4039 2018-11-23 22:50:15 Biggest difference between the rally in Calgary and a anti oil protest is that all of those in Calgary were CDN’s who had their countries best interests at heart.Many of those who go to anti oil protest are NOT CDN and want to dictate to us how we should manage our own resources
4040 2018-11-23 22:50:14 For politicians doing something is better than nothing but IMO it's a dumb idea that will cost us money for little in gains. The oil is selling too low; you're selling our non-renewable resources for that low price. But I guess some money better than nothing right? @OilGasCanada
4041 2018-11-23 22:50:12 Yes everything is good from head to toe. I would skip the Everyday Dry Oil on the face if coconut breaks you out
4042 2018-11-23 22:50:07 Except when it comes to dirty oil your #corpPuppetMasters tell you to support
4043 2018-11-23 22:50:01 My two cents, short story. Coveted Control of Oil.

Putin trying to gain control over Europe 

Trump trying to gain control over North America

4047 2018-11-23 22:49:13 What's he supposed to do, make the world price go up? Nothing on your list will address the root problem...there's more oil out there than the world needs. That's just going to get worse as your 19th century technology becomes more and more obsolete.
4048 2018-11-23 22:49:05 The Saudis aren't stupid. Drop oil prices, keeps the heat off. A US resident, with two Children ( Both US citizens) was murdered by the Saudi Government. Let that sink in.

4052 2018-11-23 22:48:51 OH ME BROOO!!! people get out the shower and don’t even think about lotion.. I be like, “you not gone put on lotion, oil, none?” them: nah, ion like the way it feel! bruhhh whatttt?????
4053 2018-11-23 22:48:50 You claim that there are numerous criminals in the Caravan, but offer zero proof. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and MBS commit murder of a US citizen right under your nose, your CIA proves it, and you push back claiming that low oil prices and your relationship are more important. SAD

4059 2018-11-23 22:48:14 You can get ZERO buzz from CBD. But seeing that you must not suffer from chronic pain or any of the things that CBD oil can and does help, then you are just as bad as the folks in Montgomery that are closed minded to anything other than a pill!
4060 2018-11-23 22:48:03 We have hydrogen fuel cells.......We don't need oil much at all.
4061 2018-11-23 22:47:56 After a yummy “Friendsgiving” meal we took on an old favorite of a painting.  One of the painters had never done an oil painting before. They all did spectacularly!

4063 2018-11-23 22:47:45 It’s all Nazi hate speech. LISTEN, there’s a literal climate genocide happening right now, it should be illegal for anyone to speak for oil or against a carbon tax - they should be charged for genocide

4071 2018-11-23 22:47:07 So the answer is ‘no’ no you don’t use sustainable palm oil. But you want to. Thank you for clearing that up.
4072 2018-11-23 22:47:02 Too bad I wasn’t in a coma for the last 4 years and woke up today with no exposure in oil...I would buy everything  and anything full margin...

4074 2018-11-23 22:46:51 @TuckerGoodrich how does duck fat do in the omega-6/omega-3 angle? Seems like the French eat tons of duck fat and is similar in composition to olive oil?
4075 2018-11-23 22:46:51 These Twats in the oil industry have actually scrapped their meagre investment in renewable energy  and have increased their asset replacement ratio.
They intend to sell five times as much fossil fuel by 2050 as the atmosphere can cope with.
They're no better than drug-dealers.
4076 2018-11-23 22:46:51 The first thing you said was wrong. We get 40% of our oil from Canada. Practical? The 9/11 bombers came from there. Trust them, for stability?. What you want is a continuation of covering up  a murder. Morality isn't easy. If it were, you'd be able to grasp it.
4077 2018-11-23 22:46:40 Our highly trained professionals determined that MBS had Jamal Khashoggi murdered.  You tout gas prices like you have something to do with that (you don't) You say oil is so important from SA, we get almost 4 times as much from Canada.  It's the $$ SA pays you & Jared
4078 2018-11-23 22:46:35 Oil money boy, why are you still thinking?  only you wan finish the small Wey remain for us ba
4079 2018-11-23 22:46:34 We must address all industries affecting climate change. #GreenNewDeal not enough. A person who eats a vegan diet produces 50% less CO2, and uses 1/11th oil, 1/13th water, and 1/18th Land. WE MUST #GOVEGAN 
4080 2018-11-23 22:46:27 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
4081 2018-11-23 22:46:26 Tens of millions of dollars being funneled into Canada by foreign special interest groups in order keep our oil landlocked and questioning who may have paid for some buses is the best your can do?
4082 2018-11-23 22:46:10 Too funny! Let’s see, he put a stop to 2 pipelines, he bought another pipeline, not to build it but to delay it. It is not his money so he doesnt care. And he has introduced bills to ensure no pipelines are ever built in Canada. He is also allowing Saudi oil in with no regulation
4083 2018-11-23 22:46:09 I'm sure everyone who couldn't care less about Jamal Khashoggi- a man, a U.S. resident, a journalist being murdered,  butchered then his body spread with acid, can "go lower." (lower oil prices)  Trump has the backs of  Xi, Putin & MBS but not the backs of "we the people."
4084 2018-11-23 22:46:00 Found a great carrot cake (not normally like it) today that had no palm oil in it.  Gosh how hard it is to find stuff that hasn't got palm oil in it.  I am from henceforth trying my best every day even if it means reading the minute detail of ingredients on packaging.

4096 2018-11-23 22:44:55 Haha

4098 2018-11-23 22:44:41 Trump must love you! Until recently I always bought American cars. My next car will be a Tesla though. I would love to be less dependent on middle eastern oil.

4101 2018-11-23 22:44:12 It’s baby food. A little oil at the bottom of the pan, peeled potatoes, a lil s&p. Roast till golden on the bottom, flip and continue roasting till the other side is golden. 400° for about 75-90 mins depending on how big the potato’s are cut. Dab on a paper towel. Just tryit once
4102 2018-11-23 22:44:02 The day that the  #ClairRidge  starts pumping oil, the BBC reports a 6% drop in oil price. #oilbad

4104 2018-11-23 22:43:48 In theory, socialist countries produce their own abundance because everyone contributes. Venezuela tried Scandinavian scheme which is not really socialism. They forgot that without oil customers, they could not support their social programs.
4105 2018-11-23 22:43:32 OIL IT! OIL IT UP GYAL!
4106 2018-11-23 22:43:31 2 hours for an oil change... cmon now.

4108 2018-11-23 22:43:12 DIdn’t the Conservatives under Harper also keep the Alberta oil landlocked for 10 years?  This government buys a pipeline (more than was done by the Conservatives) and still people freak out.  What will please you, happy lies or hard truth?
4109 2018-11-23 22:42:44 คนเยอะมั้ยคะ
4110 2018-11-23 22:42:41 They ass need some swing oil!!!
4111 2018-11-23 22:42:39 That.... That
Oil, sweat... 
4112 2018-11-23 22:42:36 The AB oil sands received tax-breaks under the 1996 Chrétien budget - accelerated capital cost allowances worth $300M/year to oil sands producers. The Harper government phased those out 2010-4.
4113 2018-11-23 22:42:36 Every profession evolves. I’m not saying we can snap our fingers & get off oil, but we need to look at progressive ways to employ those in the oil industry. Just as those who worked in coal industry had to evolve, or miners who worked a mine until it was finished & then moved on.
4114 2018-11-23 22:42:32 Nice job
4115 2018-11-23 22:42:23 Still loaded with palm oil though?
4116 2018-11-23 22:42:18 $40 mil can go along way to help the oil sector
4117 2018-11-23 22:42:17 You keep repeating an inaccurate version of history. US had nothing to do with British petroleum, stupid Mossadeq thought US oil companies were going to run British owned oil industry. US refused and tried very hard to settle the dispute between the two allies and took Iran side
4118 2018-11-23 22:42:14 @FoxNews and @realDonaldTrump supporters outraged because they think Hillary had Seth Rich killed to hide corruption.
Those same people are okay with tRump having #JamalKhashoggi killed to keep an arms deal going and keep oil prices low.
4119 2018-11-23 22:42:13 She said fossil fuel companies are bad- ummmmm, I’m pretty sure the big oil companies spend billions on research for cleaner energy.  And, they have to keep up with emissions restrictions so always making better oil additives/synthetic oils to help reduce emissions.
4120 2018-11-23 22:42:08 Just heard @BBCScotlandNews report on oil field & price. It is such a ridiculous, obvious 'oh shit how can we make this out to be bad news for Scotland'  I couldn't be bothered to get angry it made me laugh so much
4121 2018-11-23 22:42:05 We have see this before, the plunge in oil is symptomatic of the plunge in GDP to come. 2019: fasten your seatbelts
4122 2018-11-23 22:41:36 ケツがいてぇ(アスファルトに直で座っているため)
4123 2018-11-23 22:41:27 Trump should know that a weak dollar/low interest rates caused the highs in stocks,housing,and oil.A stronger dollar/raising interest rates actually brings assets back to their actual value.
4124 2018-11-23 22:41:15 Or JP
4125 2018-11-23 22:41:09 The most singularly stupid thing the greens opine is that we should not take more oil and gas out of our Scottish resources. We need to do that while it’s worth a shit so we can invest in not needing it at all.
4126 2018-11-23 22:40:58 How to
Strangle western Canada

Block a pipeline to East

Stall a pipeline to West

Stop West coast Tankers

Allow E Coast Tankers
& foreign Oil to come to Eastern Canada with oil from murderous Saudi Sheiks, Venezuela’s Dictator, & US Pipeline Oil 
Tens of Billions lost to
4127 2018-11-23 22:40:54 Or at the very least take that court ruling to the supreme court.  The Liberals have done nothing to support the oil industry. There was no need to buy the pipeline. That was a waist of our tax dollars.
4128 2018-11-23 22:40:52 THIS IS WHAT is going to happen now with OUR food,a MORON in the W.H.taking away ALL safety from OUR food,water ,air,oil drilling,climate change,,,all being distroyed,,by this Moron,he must go..
4129 2018-11-23 22:40:46 Ya. Get a discount on my oil service.
4130 2018-11-23 22:40:46 買うものが……買うものが多い……！！
4131 2018-11-23 22:40:37 I would do hair lotions and leave-In conditioners, lusters has an olive oil one that’s really good, you don’t need a lot of product, and also try the Shea moisture brand. I’m all over the place with my hair stuff but those I do happen to use and just keep my hair in braids.
4132 2018-11-23 22:40:37 Because they can't reveal papa Bush, who went from owning a small oil company to the head of the CIA in just a few short years. I wonder how that happened? How embarrassing would that be for the world to see the lies that family is built upon? Don't worry it'll all come out.
4133 2018-11-23 22:40:35 I REALLY WANTED TO POUR COCONUT OIL ON HIS WHOLE ASS HEAD  THAT SHIT LOOKED SO STIFF AND DRY

4144 2018-11-23 22:39:42 Lots of SeX and CBD oil 
4145 2018-11-23 22:39:35 I don't mind cheaper oil prices either.  Beats the heck out of expensive oil prices.
4146 2018-11-23 22:39:30 it looked so dry,, bby needs some coconut oil
4147 2018-11-23 22:39:27 Oil stocks and prices are totally disconnected from reality. The market is trading off stupid tweets and lack of knowledge. Nice to see my one gas weighted stock up the week though. #buildthepipe
4148 2018-11-23 22:39:20 Matthew 16:26 tells us:
For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

But #FollowTheMoney
#Trump thinks it's ok if he just gets the price of oil a little lower (and they use his hotel).
4149 2018-11-23 22:39:17 They use anointed oil as lubricant.
4150 2018-11-23 22:39:06 -Use coconut oil to keep nice maintained curls.
-Keep your hair untangled (comb it out every night).
-Avoid brushing your hair when it’s dry.
4151 2018-11-23 22:39:04 You in vic? I just got off my bike I’m about to let my uncle give it a tone (spark plug, oil, power steering, coolant.) all that good stuff
4152 2018-11-23 22:38:53 Drill counts aren't the issue. Most new wells produce more than older wells. Fewer wells are producing more oil.
4153 2018-11-23 22:38:53 my mom said she’s glad she got into a wreck so she doesn’t have to get an oil change anymore and she actually left me speechless
4154 2018-11-23 22:38:45 I went to Walmart for stuff to change my oil and came back with a vacuum. Then proceeded to deep clean my entire house while doctor Phil was on. You bet I had to call my grandma and tell her I finally realize exactly what her life is like.
4155 2018-11-23 22:38:37 people who have been boycotting palm oil need to do research as to which companies use eco friendly palm oil before pointing the finger and angrily refusing to consume products !!! most uk/eu based producs use renewable palm oil !!!
4156 2018-11-23 22:38:24 Definitely, Vitalite is what we buy currently! I guess sustainable palm oil is ok for now, we can only do our best with what’s available :)
4157 2018-11-23 22:38:23 Loooove to burn oil and natural gas, 
Nothing more efficient and energy rich (and cleaner) than fossil fuel : no where near you're gonna fly in a B-787 with solar panels sticking on its skin!
4158 2018-11-23 22:38:13 Yeah the Cons don’t believe it , gods going to protect them . You can’t eat oil
4159 2018-11-23 22:38:06 Palma oil free, productos de proximidad, aove, eco....y los sábados contribuyo al narcotráfico. Incoherencias del humane. Que opinan? La verdad. Nadie es perfecto

4161 2018-11-23 22:38:00 Ottawa doesn’t control the world oil prices, oil companies and leaders like Trump do! Trump has openly stated he wants oil prices to go lower, also he is in bed with Saudi. Your anger needs to be directed towards solving the problem not at dividing the country
4162 2018-11-23 22:37:56 Listen to yourself! Mob Behaviour? These are Canadian Tax Payers from Alberta! Fathers, Mothers, Sisters and Brothers! Where do you blindly see a Mob! You clearly have a Liberal or NDP bias but you need our oil to live!
4163 2018-11-23 22:37:56 "Cost of lives and money from climate change events"costs which are 300 years away at the very least and nobody cares about except for virtue signaling purposes. Btw a big part of the 430B figure is related to military subsidizing purchase and storage of oil for strategic purpose
4164 2018-11-23 22:37:54 Difference between Left and Right:
1. Climate Change, Left- cut carbon emissions. Right- pump more oil,rake leaves,it was cold yesterday, What climate change?
2. Guns, Left- assault weapons ban, no large capacity clips. Right- arm more people,children were murdered-must be a hoax
4165 2018-11-23 22:37:50 I just remove outer leaves (don't need that cross in the bottom - been proved to make no difference), halve if very large, put in bowl, pour over olive/rapeseed/sunflower oil, add salt and paprika, stir to coat, roast Gas 5 or 6 or higher until browned & as cooked as you like.
4166 2018-11-23 22:37:49 A combination of city crews are cleaning up a small oil spill on Norpoint Way. Norpoint will be closed in both directions for a couple hours from Marine View Drive to Pointe Woodworth. Access to homes at Pointe Woodworth are open but only from the top of the hill at 29th St NE.
4167 2018-11-23 22:37:33 Remember right now Libya is open game for any country that wants to go in and take control. Why? Because Libya has the absolute best quality of oil in the world
4168 2018-11-23 22:37:24 Good for you! Taking my sleeping environment seriously was a game changer for me-good sheets, good bed, weighted blanket, cooling pillow, oil diffuser. The benefits impact my whole day.
4169 2018-11-23 22:37:07 Trump screwed farmers with his tariffs. He screwed the aluminum and steel industry with tariffs. He screwed consumers on all of the above.

Why should the oil industry miss out on the fun.

Maybe Saudi Arabia will send another $100 million to Trump to make it all right.
4170 2018-11-23 22:37:04 Every time I get an oil change I know they know I know nothing about cars, you know?
4171 2018-11-23 22:37:00 Ambroxide is synthesized from sclareol, a component of the essential oil of clary sage. Sclareol is oxidatively degraded to a lactone, which is hydrogenated to the corresponding diol, The resulting compound is dehydrated to form ambroxan.
4172 2018-11-23 22:36:57 1/2   Actually, the "oil patch" IS Alberta. The Tim's or Starbuck's employee at the drive-through is serving all those folks heading to work in energy-related businesses.
4173 2018-11-23 22:36:55 I really don’t know shit about cars lmao me all confident thinking I need an oil change but the little light in my car was for my tire pressure lmao que vergüenzas paso yo 
4174 2018-11-23 22:36:54 A Trump Spockism: the Good Of The Many(low oil prices help all) Outweigh the Good Of The Few(those worried about a Muslim Brotherhood supporting reporter).
4175 2018-11-23 22:36:54 Why would they want to do that, when it’s Racism, Mommy Issues, plastic straws, plastic bags, SUVs, Trump and Big Oil causing global warming?

4179 2018-11-23 22:36:50 The government could have used the not withstanding clause. Hiw about we start using upstream and downstream emissions for all the oil that shows up at Irving's refinery, let's let's all the oil in Canada be on a level playing field, just for once
4180 2018-11-23 22:36:46 Humans are olive oil and vinegar, dogs are bread
4181 2018-11-23 22:36:44 Shall we thank to Trump for protecting King Salman or making oil prices lower @ProfDemirtas
4182 2018-11-23 22:36:38 Everyone knows the profits from Big Research dwarfs oil money 
4183 2018-11-23 22:36:06 I hope I see the day when the world no longer relies on oil. Let these backward holes turn back into the dessert culture they actually are.
4184 2018-11-23 22:35:56 Don’t want Saudi Oil or the Pipelines ... getting EV soon
4185 2018-11-23 22:35:53 I hear oil is not important because we're all going to be driving mythical 35k Model 3s around Mars this time next year.
4186 2018-11-23 22:35:48 Private ownership doesn't fix some problems.  Take palm oil plantations.  They have zero incentive to preserve rain forest and protect wildlife such as orangutans.  Their 'care' of the land involves planting, maintaining & harvesting palm oil.  What about downstream impacts?
4187 2018-11-23 22:35:48 The hands of the upward inflation targeting central banks will be held back on the steep drop in oil prices. Even those who met/exceeded the goal in Q3, could expect a sharp drop.
4188 2018-11-23 22:35:41 How low can oil go?
Prob $52

4190 2018-11-23 22:35:31 loll i was watchin the acrobatics w baby oil with my best friend n she came home and she's like "whAT arE yOu WaTChinG" n shook her head 
4191 2018-11-23 22:35:28 Milton Freemans son once came to my college to pitch buying oil rigs and turning them into libertarian societies and I still can't believe nobody yelled the plot of Bioshock at him.
4192 2018-11-23 22:35:14 With oil down to $54 a barrel I think I'm finally ready to pull the trigger on a couple of barrels. I only need a few drops to put on a squeaky hinge but I just can't resist a deal. #blackgoldfriday
4193 2018-11-23 22:34:59 I have trouble with what you put in my hair after the shower. I used to put coconut oil in my hair, but the oils would get on my pillow and face a lot. should I just sleep with a freakin shower cap or some shit lmfao
4194 2018-11-23 22:34:55 Now I remember why I hate doing my oil change lol but gotta get it done
4195 2018-11-23 22:34:54 That's good shit. I thought it was oil that blending is emaculate.
4196 2018-11-23 22:34:39 Trudeau Liberals offer Albertan's absolutely nothing. Instead they take take take while enacting steps to close off our livelihoods (Oil & Gas). Incredibly incompetent bunch of politically-correct, social-engineering Clowns.  Forget Quebec separating....maybe Alberta will.
4197 2018-11-23 22:34:32 Actually, Mr. Duff, scientists have demonstrated that being subjected to a diversity of opinion makes people smarter - how do you think we emerged from caves? So, it isn't smart to want to be surrounded by a hive mind. Actually, I think the future of oil is in petrochemicals.
4198 2018-11-23 22:34:30 Thank you distinguished senator.

But whose job is it to provide transformers to these communities and why aren't they doing it?
4199 2018-11-23 22:34:27 Any war that #America enters with #Iran means the destruction of the Persian Gulf states and its oil installations, the high prices of crude oil and gas in the world, and this could destroy the economy of America, #Britain and #Europe.

4201 2018-11-23 22:34:21 More than anybody knows. And who now is wanting to build its military? Remember it was France who wanted more Libyan oil and ole Sidney Blumenthal that got busted in a email knowing approximate amount of gold and silver.
4202 2018-11-23 22:34:18 And destroy their water supply with leaked oil. Oil leak accidents are inevitable. It's " a disgrace" to quote Donald Rump.
4203 2018-11-23 22:34:15 When a fellow female says “what foundation are you wearing it’s stayed put all day” and it was £10 from the body shop.. proper buzzing  that’s an accomplishment on my face as it usually resembles the BP oil spill that occurred in Mexico a few years ago x
4204 2018-11-23 22:34:14 The avg gas price in 2015 was only 1c higher than the avg so far this yr. the price of oil only went down under you because of too much oil on the market and OPEC's inability to get Venezuela to lower oil output. Then prices went up again because you pulled out of Iran deal
4205 2018-11-23 22:34:09 I’m all for women’s right n’all but it’s getting a bit too much. I mean the girls (Fleur & Sair) have had decent meals for the past few days and also recieved their ‘hair oil & cream’s the other day, so surely Nick and James deserve something ! That was so unfair #ImACeleb
4206 2018-11-23 22:34:06 Fuck off! Theres coconut oil in it as well!! 
4207 2018-11-23 22:33:53 No, tech geek.  It is too much CO2 from fossil fuels pumped from underground and released to the air. Oil, coal.  It is like a caravan of non humans  chemicals that HAVE impacts that become American every time we use a lightbulb and more.
4208 2018-11-23 22:33:45 If BP used plastic straws to suck the oil spill out of the ocean all you libtard cucks would still be complaining 
4209 2018-11-23 22:33:36 Bet you are a trump Chump! Let’s put a oil refinery in your back yard and pump the noxious sludge in to your drinking water. Then you can claim that the fossile fuel is “truly” benign.
4210 2018-11-23 22:33:30 Sometimes @POTUS doesn’t do himself any favors-like pledging to lay off #SaudiArabia as long as they sell us cheap oil & buy stuff- but @realDonaldTrump gets cut no slack-Now they’re harping on his not having visited troops in the field-If he went they’d say he was grandstanding.
4211 2018-11-23 22:33:21 Coconut oil. A locked up boy's best friend #chastity
4212 2018-11-23 22:33:18 Oil and gas lending.
4213 2018-11-23 22:33:09 That's ridiculous. You exchange reason and facts for snake oil while innocents die, making you neither compassionate or intelligent. You're just another apologist that thinks folding his hands together is a valid solution. You're the problem.

4217 2018-11-23 22:32:13 U pay the high oil prices
4218 2018-11-23 22:32:09 I’m not in favour of government ownership of the pipeline, preferring private sector, and question the Liberal commitment to see TM built, particularly the failure to follow their own revamped review process, and the lack of support for oil/gas as absent from the fiscal update.
4219 2018-11-23 22:32:02 You have done so much good work to make oil crash. Don’t worry about those who invested in the USO ETF. They are bad deep state people. And they crashed the stock market too. But now everything is cheap because of the Denald
4220 2018-11-23 22:32:01 - Edibles take a bit longer than like sublingual oil. Give it an hour- 90 mins! If you don't feel anything, increase with .5 of a gummy! Sometimes it's about finding the sweet spot.
- Yeah! Ex: if your stomach is empty or full when you took it. That's a factor!
- It totally can!!
4221 2018-11-23 22:32:01 But has Palm oil
4222 2018-11-23 22:31:50 aye the curse of oil eh?
4223 2018-11-23 22:31:38 Oo another nice drop in oil. Are you ok? Hope the fund hasnt been busted!
4224 2018-11-23 22:31:36 I have just one thing to say: I  oil.
4225 2018-11-23 22:31:32 Egoman gets good MSM coverage and pics.

Rally of thousands and pics and sense ignored by MSM. Morneau says he did a lot for oil patch, $4.5B. Too  arrogant.
4226 2018-11-23 22:31:30 Thank god my dad is changing my oil tomorrow. That shit sound rough 
4227 2018-11-23 22:31:18 Iran desperate to force oil higher #oott
4228 2018-11-23 22:31:06 Good grief you really are clueless.  There is no market for our product at the moment. There is no issue in terms of access. And no, I don't support corporate welfare for oil companies in AB. I do think Alberta needs to stop being lazy and start thinking outside the box.
4229 2018-11-23 22:31:05 There is deep distrust of the science, which is funded by oil companies. They pay "scientists" to debunk reports, while apparently funding research to "fix" the problem they know they created!
For most people I think the enormity is too big to grasp so they're in denial.
4230 2018-11-23 22:31:05 I worked in the oil industry, spoke to other Engineers who were there for Cameron’s visit! 

Remember the riggers being horsed off the installations and warned to keep their gobs shut about the confirmed yield.
4231 2018-11-23 22:31:02 Like most things, good with butter. :-)

Ours were sliced thin and baked with cheese and herbs between -- not unlike scalloped potatoes, sort of.

You can also cut them into wedges, kinda like home fries, toss with oil and herbs and bake until texture you like.
4232 2018-11-23 22:31:00 Since I started using the fancy herb and essential oil soaps nobody can make me use dollar store soap again
4233 2018-11-23 22:31:00 jojoba oil
4234 2018-11-23 22:30:55 We lived before oil, and one way or another, we will again.  Prepare accordingly.
4235 2018-11-23 22:30:53 Her shirt is an impressive admission of the obvious -  "Low Class Oil Trash".  Very nice. 

You can keep her #UPC #CPC.
4236 2018-11-23 22:30:39 The sooner you left wingnuts figure fhis out the better this  ENTIRE" country will be.
So stop using you I-pad, I-phone made with oil products and start using Morse-code to send out the crap spread.

He's from a fishing family
And was in the right place at the right time to be a supplier to O&G
4238 2018-11-23 22:30:30 Right we should continue to sell our oil for 25 a barrel and buy it at the world price 50 - 70. There for we fund nice places like Iran. Venezuela and Arab states.
4239 2018-11-23 22:30:29 BG Group plc was a British multinational oil and gas company headquartered in Reading, United Kingdom. On 8 April 2015, Royal Dutch Shell announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire BG Group for $70 billion,. The sale was completed on 15 February 2016.
4240 2018-11-23 22:30:16 Kinda how I remember it sport. They told us all the oil would run out really fast.Wouldn't pay for everything. They told me to eat my cereal.
4241 2018-11-23 22:30:13 AB has sent those transfer pymts without fail or issue, until the energy industry was hit with the “dirty oil” campaign and Notley/Trudeau took the knee caps out by supporting social justice, new reg, without a transition plan. But keep it up. I’d like AB/SK TO LEAVE FEDERATION.
4242 2018-11-23 22:30:07 will this also reduce the efficiency of solor energy forcing the populace back into using oil and fossil fuels? there;s more to this then what they are stating. Also what impact could this have on the eco-system plants and animals? This doesn't sound good at all. #Suspicious
4243 2018-11-23 22:29:57 I hated the powder. The capsules were okay. The pressed oil form in liquid worked for me.
4244 2018-11-23 22:29:46 The international prices of oil are also out of Trump's little hands. And low international oil prices are not necessarily a good thing to the largest oil producer of the world (that is USA, for clarity).
4245 2018-11-23 22:29:44 As long as you all keep eating the past with extra virgin olive oil washed down with a bucket of Chianti, who cares?

4250 2018-11-23 22:28:50 Yes Diane this is beyond hate and anger  This mobs  was notspewing hate when the price off oil  dropped this low when Harper was in gov and if the cons were in power in Ottawa this mob rage would not happen A lot off Albertans are so bitter and full off anger

4254 2018-11-23 22:28:23 British nationalists lied about oil in 2014. I had no patience for the lies then, I've none now. If you're annoyed about it, maybe best not to lie?
4255 2018-11-23 22:28:21 this was from bing.  I'm skeptical about all this stuff, but I'm not a scientist and it's a huge topic.  a MAGA supporter told me all the climate skeptics were in big oil's pocket so that is a red flag.
4256 2018-11-23 22:28:19 Yes, he @ProfOsinbajo is like them. Upside-down personnel. U r like d biblical 5 virgins without extra oil waiting for d bride. U hv sold ur soul to hypocrisy. Get behind me, u did not take care of me when I visited as a stranger.
4257 2018-11-23 22:28:09 Haven’t seen the effect on oil field out here yet but it is coming.

4259 2018-11-23 22:28:01 POTUS Wants too extend a Christmas comfort to all who will Jump OUT A Window when viewing 401K's this January! Don't feel to bad as Trump made another BILLION SHORTING OIL!!! It's Good To Be The King & NOT have to worry about INSIDER TRADING! OH YEAH! @CNBC @WSJ @barronsonline
4260 2018-11-23 22:27:50 Deep state/CIA has oil interests in UAE. They won't lose billions of $s, for one man.
4261 2018-11-23 22:27:21 @POTUS I hear you talking about oil being $45 a barrel then why aren’t gas prices dropping you son of a @&)!?
4262 2018-11-23 22:27:16 Pipe down you oil owned empty stadium bell end
4263 2018-11-23 22:27:13 As good as it sounds. Money is what matters to people in GOV. Fossil fuels have to much reach, meaning more money to buy people off & keep change away

Alternative fuel ls not enough of the economy to fight the money coal, gas, & oil can throw around & no1 wants 2 increase price
4264 2018-11-23 22:27:08 Oil subsides are 430B globally,the 5T figure comes entirely from computing externalities,too bad they didn't calculate the externalities of a world without fossil fuels where baseline power isn't provided, hospital can't function, global trade halted..more than 5T, more like 300T
4265 2018-11-23 22:27:06 Some people like oil boxcar. Some people like real car Tesla each Tesla car can save your personal data in the future from the cloud such as music photo and so on the cloud on wheels maybe IBM cloud

4267 2018-11-23 22:26:38 “America First” is fundamentally flawed in asserting we can be isolated from complex interdependencies among all Nations.

#Trump #GOP must go.  #ForThePeople
4268 2018-11-23 22:26:35 Its funny reading all these articles about oil companies taking extreme measures to continue doing their work for profit. Its as if we werent learning in school that fossil fuels were being used up as they stripped the Earth of key nutrients, creating climate change.
4269 2018-11-23 22:26:34 هنطنش ونعيش
4270 2018-11-23 22:26:30 Can’t tell me shit when i wash and clean my car then get an oil changeee ...feel like moneeyyy lol
4271 2018-11-23 22:26:25 It’s not addiction to oil, it is dealings w foreign powers we are not privy to know. Trump is indebted to Saudi & Russia in ways we may never know. So much so he condones a brutal murder. Disgusting! His time is almost up. The house under new leadership will make him miserable.
4272 2018-11-23 22:26:25 @farooqkperogi I need to see who certified you
4273 2018-11-23 22:26:10 Oil money is blood money you ghouls
4274 2018-11-23 22:26:08 Foods and other products with palm oil would need another similar product in them, so you'd have to switch it for something else, which would have their own impacts. That could be an alternative, but as the article suggests, palm oil is 10x more productive. Always look broad
4275 2018-11-23 22:26:06 11% of oil comes from Saudi Arabia. FYI, gas prices were significantly lower during the Obama years
4276 2018-11-23 22:26:00 Depends, if its on top and the oil pools like a little tea cup then yeah, but otherwise nah
4277 2018-11-23 22:26:00 Off to bed
4278 2018-11-23 22:26:00 One last thing, I expect my government to do what's best for the country, we shouldn't be using Saudi or any foreign oil in this country. We have more than enough. The entire country would benefit from the tax dollars in the federal and provincial economies.
4279 2018-11-23 22:25:57 When I spend money on something necessary, like an oil change, I feel like I have the right to spend the same amount on something for myself
4280 2018-11-23 22:25:43 Yes! I continually told them then my d-i-law did the core testing for that field & that there was over 100 years worth of oil and MUCH of it was recoverable (MUCH more now!) but I was jeered & sneered at & told to stop lying. Who were the LIARS?! 
4281 2018-11-23 22:25:42 Probably not, but maybe if she is worth as much as Saudi oil.
4282 2018-11-23 22:25:41 It's nice to pay so little at the pump, but the last time oil got this low, thousands of oil field workers lost their jobs. American oil companies cannot afford to drill at this price.

BEAUTIFUL SUICIDE; KILL, FIND OIL, REPEAT; STUPED SCHOOL; A PSA FOR THE PSYCHOPATHS. MORE SONGS SET TO BE ANNOUNCED
4288 2018-11-23 22:24:45 The focus on oil supply/demand right now rather than the financial asset "risk off" dynamic, is a real time lesson in how markets extract the maximum from naive agents.
4289 2018-11-23 22:24:30 Location?
4290 2018-11-23 22:24:27 Hillary and the Democrats are not an opposition party to the GOP. They serve the same corporate masters. We need a bottom up people’s party to take on the thieving capitalist bankers, warmongers, oil cartels, and the health insurance mafia. Democrats won’t.
4291 2018-11-23 22:24:22 Can we compare it to the taxes the industry pays to all levels of government and see how it nets out?  I know we’ll find the oil and gas industry  “subsidizes” hospitals and schools all over this country.
4292 2018-11-23 22:24:21 It's essentially oven baked pancake mix in hot oil 
4293 2018-11-23 22:23:46 Awww rub castor oil on it and on your cheek it will stop the pain and swelling awww I just did that for like five days
4294 2018-11-23 22:23:43 The #BankofCanada does not want to see this $oil chart!  Might be hard to stabilize the dollar if it slices through $51.  

$USDCAD
4295 2018-11-23 22:23:31 Ok. I know I’m late to the party but this CBD oil thing is a real game changer. ALL MY STRESS IS GONE. Well at least bodily.
4296 2018-11-23 22:23:28 So you're suggesting we should create a single major government owned oil company like Norway has? I don't think that would work here, tbh.
4297 2018-11-23 22:23:23 I think most sane Americans know that Climate Change is REAL and that we need to take action ASAP.  It is time to ignore the I’d man in the WH who’s only interest is making money on his investments.  Apparently he  is tied to fossil fuels since he supports oil, oil pipelines, and

4299 2018-11-23 22:23:18 The laws do not require them to produce fuel for Canadian's motor vehicles. And they don't require them to account for the price they charge. So even though the price of oil is very low the price of refined product is very high.

4301 2018-11-23 22:23:04 It's been his Enviro junky plan along. 1. Cut off export 2. Cut off investment 3. Excess oil causes it to stay in the ground.  Success. 

We are at step 3 which is what the Enviro group wanted all along. 

Time to seperate folks. Country is being run by activists.
4302 2018-11-23 22:22:54 These sales are tempting. I just dropped a couple hundred bucks on fixing an oil leak, so that took me out of the game effectively, lol

4304 2018-11-23 22:22:48 I'm happy about the stance on palm oil and the banned advert
4305 2018-11-23 22:22:28 Well should they go down, it's certainly not because of our "friend" Saudi Arabia. We only buy 11% of our oil from them. Thank our "enemy" Canada
4306 2018-11-23 22:22:27 All thanks to your Daddy's oil subsidy fraud.
4307 2018-11-23 22:22:16 I have a friend who does it and it’s delicious.  Crisp skin and moist meat. It’s a drag because it takes so much oil and a special container.

4310 2018-11-23 22:21:59 Cheap energy accessibility. I wouldn't think it necessarily had to be based on oil.
4311 2018-11-23 22:21:59 You sir are a liar. While you take credit for lower oil prices, perhaps you can take credit for the stock market crash.  Oh wait, you blame others for the bad things that happens under your watch.
4312 2018-11-23 22:21:48 Question,  where has all the Oil money gone, Has it been spent of Social policies NOT  a chance, OK so where has it gone who has made off with/ siphoned billions off or which Oil Companies have stitched it all up.
Socialism with that Oil Revenue would equal Norway. Socialism not
4313 2018-11-23 22:21:46 Lol like engine oil
4314 2018-11-23 22:21:34 As soon as IndyRef2 is on will there be statements that all that oil is actually running out?

4316 2018-11-23 22:21:18 Essential oil for diffuser sticks was £9 in the shop today (we have a dead mouse under the floor). I found an abandoned aftershave and poured that in 
4317 2018-11-23 22:21:17 We have turned into a country that alienates their closest allies and embrace our adversaries. Show that lives can be bought and sold for oil, or an arms deal. Other countries know,we have a president that upholds violence, racism, hypocrisy, spews hate and separate families. IMO
4318 2018-11-23 22:21:15 It’s a real shame of Trumpism. A lot of good, hard working people bought his snake oil.

4323 2018-11-23 22:20:40 Unfortunately my congressman is Kevin McCarthy and he has had his mouth on the dicks of oil company execs for years.
4324 2018-11-23 22:20:36 So check with this free trade agreement between Mexico and United States means a boost in Mexico's economy and their main export no longer will be narcotics Mexico is sitting on a bunch of oil that they can now sell they will also have the car Industries building cars there
4325 2018-11-23 22:20:35 #isitok for you to make light of Iceland’s ad about the devastating effects of our government’s cow-towing neglect of condemnation of palm oil trade for reasons relating to “business” with Malaysia.
4326 2018-11-23 22:20:34 You sound like trump. Our economy is booming because the world economy is booming. Stop BS canadians. Liberals are actually slowing the economy in canada.
Fix the oil issues, fix the Phoniex payroll, fix the veterans issues, fix the postal issues. Do something
4327 2018-11-23 22:20:31 what's oil price? When  we don't hv electricity in this  24th cc in 9ja..lozers.. leader .

4331 2018-11-23 22:20:00 The oil revenues are calculated in GERS. We hugely benefit from the sharing of tax revenues anyway & don't suffer the risks of the vagaries of wild movements in the oil price which affects profits & therefore tax revenues.
4332 2018-11-23 22:19:53 Do not even mention oil...

4335 2018-11-23 22:19:49 Just because you were hired while they were in power doesn't mean they created the job or the economic cx for hiring. This province runs on oil, and when oil goes up, so does hiring. ESPECIALLY in mcmurray. Your assertion is laughable.
4336 2018-11-23 22:19:33 Was thinking the same!
I would hope maybe they used olive oil instead?
4337 2018-11-23 22:19:26 You have no clue how oil moves. The guy who owns the pipe gets paid by other producers if they want to move their oil. The pipe is the bank. Trudeau now has his personal piggy invested in moving oil. For himself. Bc that's what socialists do. Ask Venezuela.
4338 2018-11-23 22:19:25 That was trump holding a fake turkey, in a fake war for oil. I know you were probably too young to remember, but some of us do. Stop trying to make bush presidential; he was the prototype for trump.
4339 2018-11-23 22:19:24 Me: “Justin, don’t use Tea Tree Oil because it’s toxic to Dakota.” *sets out oil away from others so he doesn’t absent mindedly grab it in the box*

Justin: “Got it!” 

Also Justin: *literally goes for the only one away from the box of oils and uses the Tea Tree Oil*

4340 2018-11-23 22:19:23 I wanna do the mineral oil one so bad!
4341 2018-11-23 22:19:22 Sadly too many things. If you google palm oil, you can find lists of products. Oreos, Ben and Jerry’s Ice cream,many baked goods 
4342 2018-11-23 22:19:21 Not to make light of the Jewish Israel First Lobby, but we have Big Pharma, Big Oil, the Gun Lobby, Militsry Lobby and more.
4343 2018-11-23 22:19:16 there's some merits to naturopaths but it really is 99.999% snake oil.  my uncle spent their entire savings, sold their home, just to pay for one to treat his wife's cancer, it did nothing but give her hope that maybe THIS handful of apricot seeds would cure her.
4344 2018-11-23 22:19:10 Renewable resource that is 100% degradable/compostable vs a plastic straw made from crude oil that will never go away.
4345 2018-11-23 22:19:10 It’s lots of olive oil, garlic, chilli flakes and nutritional yeast which is a cheesy like substitute lots of vegans use.
4346 2018-11-23 22:18:59 HELL NO.  THESE CLOWNS ATTACKED US ON 9/11 AND HAVE ALWAYS HAD A FREE PASS IN THE NAME OF OIL AND MONEY FOR THE FEW.  ENOUGH.
4347 2018-11-23 22:18:56 Do you think Happy Powell is paying attention to housing, pmi’s, OIL & the Stockmarket? Or is he just focused on the low unemployment and the Fed balance sheet? What’s hurting us more the QT or the rate hikes?

4351 2018-11-23 22:18:40 The #UsefulIdiots of the Left opposed nuclear in support of the Soviets, but now they’ve gone, they see they can’t stop oil with windmills, so they are relenting on nuclear.
4352 2018-11-23 22:18:38 there's s store here in Annapolis (not far from DC) that will let you taste many varieties of olive oil.
4353 2018-11-23 22:18:22 I think the answer here is that oil crashes are still negative but not the same downside beta we saw in 2014-16
4354 2018-11-23 22:18:13 Your focus on clean tech is an a political plus. Being suspected of trying to cripple Albert's oil industry is a big error.
4355 2018-11-23 22:18:12 the oil company called randy at 9am to pay for our oil and he blocked them cause they woke him up 
4356 2018-11-23 22:18:04 Yeah coconut oil burns like crazy and is high in saturated fats you're better off using rapeseed oil for cooking or just plain sunflower oil
4357 2018-11-23 22:17:47 Conservatives want to blame the liberals but it’s Harper’s legacy of failure that haunts Albertans.  Harper had nine years in office and could not build a single pipe line to the West Coast freeing Alberta oil. That level of incompetence is hard to fathom.
4358 2018-11-23 22:17:28 A lot bro,  they are the oil producing part of Ondo state and that's why Ondo state is part of Niger Delta

UK state will fight tooth & nail to maintain UK 'sovereignty' of oil & gas assets.

Tough fight.
4364 2018-11-23 22:16:34 Should be no-brainer for a govt committed to combating climate change. And given long-standing intl committment to end oil and gas subsidies. Time for real action #JustTransition

4376 2018-11-23 22:15:36 When Justin was elected the deficit was approx. $1 billion - this deficit belongs to your hero alone. He is responsible for cancelling Energy East (Saudi oil is more eco-friendly) and Northern Gateway. Apparently trains are better than pipelines. Try facts not Liberal propaganda
4377 2018-11-23 22:15:26 Okay think I put the Cream Cleanser, Everyday Dry Oil, and Silk Body Cream. Shower with the Cream Cleanser, follow with the EDO if you want something light right out of the shower,the silk body cream is for when you’re feeling dry. Best straight out the shower but good at anytime

4390 2018-11-23 22:14:42 I remember the days when $CPG offered a bistro for employees and I went on an all expenses paid rafting trip down the Grand Canyon for a different oil company as a way to learn about "geology". Crazy. Times have changed.
4391 2018-11-23 22:14:34 Do you think this will change the mind of staunch unionists to vote Indy? Do you think we’ll get another shot at Indy after the brexit shambles and the fact this oil is ‘the bargaining chip?’
4392 2018-11-23 22:14:29 He was talking about the world economy, and how the oil prices would affect it, not us. No, we don't need Saudi Arabia's oil, but a lot of the world does. So when Trump says he puts the United states first, you criticize, but if he's concerned about the world, you criticize.

4407 2018-11-23 22:12:51 We’re not talking about oil. They’re privately owned internet companies. While we may have legitimate gripes about censorship, you can bet that if the govt gets involved, decides what should & shouldn’t be allowed, conservatives will be silenced.

4412 2018-11-23 22:12:29 Would your government be willing to hold a referendum on Implementing a sales tax? Every province has one Is Alberta being screwed out of Tax revenue. In your fantasy world you believe oil money will resolve everything.
4413 2018-11-23 22:12:22 Stocks end the shortened session lower led by declining oil prices and falling energy shares. Dow -180 points.

4419 2018-11-23 22:11:20 MSM reporting of the oil industry has been the subject of astonishment and hilarity for years you could believe oil was extracted  by ballpoint pens and word processor so complete is their expertise

4423 2018-11-23 22:10:57 You think a 35% drop in Oil price won't have an impact.

Seriously?

From where I am you seem like someone that doesn't understand numbers.
4424 2018-11-23 22:10:56 Sometimes I think that I'm completely alone with a question. Why exactly is Saudi Arabia critically important to the vital interests of the US? As the EU has reached GDP parity to the US and Russia doesn't need SA oil, SA is an EU regional concern. Not our circus. Not our monkey.

4438 2018-11-23 22:09:33 this is monumentally stupid and almost certainly has as-yet-unknown disastrous consequences. this is exactly the sort of 'solution' we will see more and more of from the tech and oil industries as they scramble for an alternative to transitioning to green energy

4440 2018-11-23 22:09:31 It also said we were going to run out of oil in 1990. I VERY clearly remember this because as kids in the late 90's, it was obvious to us that the science book was outdated. I mean, you can say whatever you like, it isn't going to change what my textbook said.
4441 2018-11-23 22:09:25 Ok. So how did the pompous orange tub of lard get oil prices to drop??  U can not possibly believe what he says can you??
4442 2018-11-23 22:09:22 i’ve drenched my face in tea tree oil and downed another half a litre. i have high hopes lmao my life could be falling apart but i need my skin to be perfect 
4443 2018-11-23 22:09:19 Its easy to understand why conservative mouth piece #AndrewBolt and shadow policy maker @AlanJones are against climate change.

Their puppet master @rupertmurdoch has a chunk.of an oil/gas/coal company.

4444 2018-11-23 22:09:18 At least you are honest enough to admit that the butchery US did in middle east in response to Bin laden’s savagery of 9/11. ( whom they self trained in Afghanistan earlier) was for oil. Of course it did guarantee oil, but tore world apart and radicalized muslims further.

4451 2018-11-23 22:08:58 Trump keeps pointing to oil prices which seems like a bribe from Saudi Arabia to boost his approval rating. I wonder what Russia did for him

Because they will stop soon.
4454 2018-11-23 22:08:48 Oil price headed in a downward trajectory

4457 2018-11-23 22:08:29 He sighed softly and nodded, trudging off to the bathroom so he could take that bath. He put some of the lavender oil in the water before stripping down and lowering himself in the bath.

He just wanted his Bucky.
4458 2018-11-23 22:08:15 I think the moral case is clear - people should be protected from injury both now and in the future. If this morality was crystallized as law it would be extremely useful in any action taken against oil companies today.
4459 2018-11-23 22:08:11 Because changing the oil fostered a better relationship with said vehicles? Cute how men purposely miss the point, - NOT.

4464 2018-11-23 22:07:35 Really.  So explain to me what the pompous orange tub of lard has to do with lower oil prices from the Middle East.

4469 2018-11-23 22:07:20 These people are utterly delusional. Last time I checked it was the regime who was making deals to bus ISIS fighters around Syria to fight the Rebels. Also if you want to talk about collusion the regime was the largest buyer of ISIS gas and oil for years.

4471 2018-11-23 22:06:59 Yes but do we actually need palm oil?
4472 2018-11-23 22:06:54 Saudi Arabia didn’t exist before oil and it won’t exist afterwards. The sun is setting on their time in the history books.
4473 2018-11-23 22:06:54 Я на это и намекала отправимся в Хогвартс
4474 2018-11-23 22:06:39 you're probably at the point where your tolerance is so high that you're barely getting high, unless you smoke oil.   If you feel like you need it for everyday tasks then maybe you are experiencing slight dependence and should make  it more of a recreational thing.
4475 2018-11-23 22:06:37 Men don't only want cedar/tea tree oil scents for their beards. Too bad I didn't know a responsive company that would be willing to look at mixing Frankincense & Myrrh in a beard oil or the other scents they offer as beard oils. @IndigoWild can you help? I'll be a guinea pig.
4476 2018-11-23 22:06:33 Based on historical data, if the bulk of the oil and gas industry was located in ON and QC the Federal government would be working very hard to fix the current problem. We simply don’t have the votes to matter.

4492 2018-11-23 22:05:26 i’m at the dealership getting my trucks oil changed and i just watched the guy spend literally five minutes trying to park it properly
4493 2018-11-23 22:05:21 I'm going to assume those scientists have already accepted that business interests will always come first, so they're desperately searching for solutions that don't include oil and coal companies changing their ways to not kill us all
4494 2018-11-23 22:04:56 so then they will have a reason to raise mortgage rates again since the oil price went down..where Poloz studied?
4495 2018-11-23 22:04:56 hmmm, yea.  The magic word here is "Liberal" and "NDP".  It's so simple.  Oil price is falling... because of the LIBs and the NDPs.

4500 2018-11-23 22:04:29 Ah it doesn't actually work that way, but glad you feel entitled to fill another Country's president in with you oil prices 101 for grade 4. The unabashed ignorance of the left is mind blowing.

4503 2018-11-23 22:04:19 @JustinTrudeau there will be a war brewing in middle east/Europe in the future. Iran will try to cut off oil supply to the world. You might as well prepare to stock up oil, invest in refinery & manufacturing job. Once a war starts,  is better prepared.

4506 2018-11-23 22:04:17 We need better fuel standards so we can cut off middle east oil.  The '73 embargo was a disruption of only 5% of the oil supply

4519 2018-11-23 22:03:26 I hope they learn a lesson here, and do things a little differently.  They have so much land and perfect climate to grow anything. Plus the oil, these people should not be hungry. Like they got rich and forgot how to produce food.

4523 2018-11-23 22:03:11 What does @SquirrelJock think now? Now the secret oil field is publicly pumping out oil?
4524 2018-11-23 22:03:06 there is uncertainty without increased pipeline capacity for crude oil in western canada - basically no pipeline means soft economy. In the long run yes it things may be fine but real estate market has been in severe correction mode - banks are exposed mostly through mortgages
4525 2018-11-23 22:02:55 Every species destroys and changes its environment. What's toxic to one may be essential for another. The use of oil is not inherently bad. The use of oil or any other act that causes harm to should be attacked for its harm, and benefits should be lauded. You don't have a point.

4527 2018-11-23 22:02:46 No they are not. They are strategically set into motion over where we use natural resources. CA with its winerys & agriculture being decimated by 100 yr droughts & Apocalyptic fires.  Gulf of Mexico with oil production refineries & fishing being blown down and ecosystems ruined.

The state subsidies are paid by the foot draggers, who will also have to write off fossil tech. Coal & oil will die.

4541 2018-11-23 22:01:26 why are the interests rates keep going up anyway as oil was not even near where it was years ago?..it is the way  Poloz & banks to help Liberal Gov to "balance" its budget that went on a shopping spree ..bank rates increased/vs decreases shall only be used in exceptional cases

4543 2018-11-23 22:01:14 History has shown that grain cars tend to get bumped first! Add extra oil cars to coast, a couple of snow storms, a few railway excuses and poof you have grain prices on the prairies showing what the cost of grain ships waiting in port is. Most winters in past have had backlogs
4544 2018-11-23 22:01:13 But Trump Admin still trying to bring back coal and lower emissions standards?  Still gutting the EPA? Opening more areas for oil drilling? Cutting clean tech investment? Raising cost of solar?  Denying the science?  Allowing fools to govern and they will kill you.
4545 2018-11-23 22:00:56 Yes he would gladly murder any reporter who gets under his skin, if he could get away with it, like his buddy Putin. He thanked the Saudis the next day and then with a big smirk on his face pretended it was about the price of oil, which nobody was talking about.

4551 2018-11-23 22:00:17 I also use diamond, Holla me when the deal drop
4552 2018-11-23 22:00:15 I looked a little more into the topic and it seems mostly about oil and economic power but idk what we can do to help out in regards to the starving children ykwim
4553 2018-11-23 22:00:13 @DonBraid 
You fail to mention a little point of interest called getting our oil to  tidal waters. If wouldn't matter who did what if we can't get to market.
Duh!    Must be a Lib!
4554 2018-11-23 22:00:10 Off the oil early today 
4555 2018-11-23 22:00:08 That box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
4556 2018-11-23 22:00:06 Morning exercise #2: Take omega-3 fish oil (particularly if you are a contact sport athlete). WHAT MOST NEGLECT is the level of EPA/DHA in the fish oil: So? We recommend you take Nordic Naturals 2x daily (1x in AM/PM), one of the only companies with reasonable EPA/DHA levels
4557 2018-11-23 22:00:00 Chicken: spinach, artichoke heart, sun-dried tomato, garlic and olive oil, Fusilli
4558 2018-11-23 21:59:51 Scotland and Norway discovered oil at the same time.

Norway is dripping in wealth.

Scotland has poverty and foodbanks.

Please wake up Scotland.

4559 2018-11-23 21:59:50 Leave the Middle East alone and you won’t have any refugees but you know oil, weapon sales...
4560 2018-11-23 21:59:50 I love how Europe loves to blame all its problems on the US. Of course when Saddam threatened that oil they practically begged the US to do something.
4561 2018-11-23 21:59:45 Keeping my subi pristine is expensive , 93 gas and full synthetic oil but it’s worth it for my babe
4562 2018-11-23 21:59:42 Oh no hope your paw gets better soon buddy  I gots arthritis in my back legs, got meds to take for it but if I'm having a bad day mam massages organic coconut oil in, I love her so much  our humans are the BEST aren't they  I also have a raised food station 
4563 2018-11-23 21:59:26 I don't think we have much choice tbh, the climate crisis will be used against us in the next campaign and we need a post-oil strategy. I think the difference with renewables is they're not geographically tied the same way oil was. rUK has ample scope to develop their own.
4564 2018-11-23 21:59:11 Is it the oil by itself or the oil with a conditioner?
4565 2018-11-23 21:59:06 Anyone in DC know of places in the area that offer olive oil tastings? #foodiebatsignal
4566 2018-11-23 21:58:55 Et le gaz oïl l'essence que comptez vous faire à ce sujet?Pour les gens qui ont un véhicule la baisser à 50 centimes le litre comparaison à total vous auriez beaucoup de clients même 30 centimes en moins .
4567 2018-11-23 21:58:39 i can't recall but which one of them 
4568 2018-11-23 21:58:12 ON & PQ have most factories, mines, people, cold weather and cars so therefore consume most of the oil. PQ has benefited most from equalization payments from West. Therefore maybe you should take more risk?
4569 2018-11-23 21:57:47 So basically, if we ever get invaded it would be because of the US, either directly or in co-operation with the Russians. Both countries are after the oil reserves in the Canadian Arctic. Russia wouldn't try it without assurance America would stay out. But the US wants the oil $
4570 2018-11-23 21:57:43 Next Trump will be telling us that we need to heat our homes with coal fired furnaces and use whale oil for our lamps.
4571 2018-11-23 21:57:41 
4572 2018-11-23 21:57:41 i rly just need a man that can change my oil
4573 2018-11-23 21:57:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
4574 2018-11-23 21:57:34 My babe naa
4575 2018-11-23 21:57:28 Seems to me we risk making the same mistake twice. In the 70s it was, “It’s Scotland’s Oil”, and that didn’t work. If we try, “It’s Scotland’s Renewables”, why will that be any different?
4576 2018-11-23 21:57:27 I'm sitting here at work listening to the Oil game and waiting on Tiger vs Phil updates from @ElNatetweets     so far, nothing.
4577 2018-11-23 21:57:18 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
4578 2018-11-23 21:57:12 Nah I think you'll be alright. Lol o accidentally took 10 drops of an essential oil that I wasn't supposed to ingest. I'm still alive and unfortunately didn't even get high
4579 2018-11-23 21:57:12 They have all that oil...they don't need nuclear power
4580 2018-11-23 21:57:12 As I walk to the Mcdonalds for the third day in a row I'm jumped and stuffed into the back of a car and driven to the outskirts of town.
The trunk opens and I see my attacker, it's Jamie Oliver armed with a bottle of olive oil.
4581 2018-11-23 21:57:05 Let's make this simple for your empty head. Firstly, Trump does not control the prices charged by the gas stations. Secondly, he never alleged that it was record low, he said it was very low. Thirdly, even if oil were cheaper during the Obama government (which they weren't)next-
4582 2018-11-23 21:57:04 The oil price differential costs the country about $100M a day. Regardless of your political stance, it’s incredibly foolish for us to be selling our non renewal resources for pennies on the dollar.
4583 2018-11-23 21:56:56 Can't you see the premises looks as clean as an infant factory? Check the Juabeng Oil mills and this one you'll see the difference between an already existing oil mill factory and a new one.

4586 2018-11-23 21:56:43 The solution is NOT to sell NNPC, that will be narrow approach to the issue. We shld be talking about oil/gas industry reforms. The rot in NNPC tells us that the present industry structure is obsolete. Anything short of whole sale reforms will be sub-optimal
4587 2018-11-23 21:56:30 Noticed something interesting... one fashion/beauty mag will have an article about, say, crystal healing, or CBD oil. Then I'll read one or even two other magazines that month or the following month that have an almost but not quite identical article about the same subject

4595 2018-11-23 21:55:51 I'm betting he forgot this country *has* an oil industry. His head is so easily turned. /  "US oil producers left seething after Trump’s becomes a cheerleader for the Saudis."
4596 2018-11-23 21:55:28 Little kid on the food network: “This cake is unique because I use oil instead of butter.”
Jenny: “Psh, I use oil in all of my cakes.......Because that’s what the mix tells me to add.”
4597 2018-11-23 21:55:22 Dangerous game though.  Those differentials will vanish quickly (and so might the heavy oil those refineries crave) if this is the push required to get Canadian oil to tw.  We’ll see.
4598 2018-11-23 21:55:12 Data is the new Oil.
4599 2018-11-23 21:55:11 I wonder how Modi got Trump to give India an exemption on Nov 5 from the Iran Sanctions. Oil prices cratered, and the rupee just had its best week ever. If you didn't realize it was the Sanctions that caused the rupee to fall, oil prices to rise, threatening Modi's reelection.
4600 2018-11-23 21:55:08 I LOVE sprouts.  Have you tried roasting them? (covered in good oil and salt and perhaps paprika).  Or in miso sauce, if you like that sort of thing (can provide recipe....).
4601 2018-11-23 21:54:56 Sucks to be you
4602 2018-11-23 21:54:45 Long wait, but NETA Northampton was great! Got an indica tincture, cooking oil, and chocolate bar + Jack Frost, Flo,  & Sweet Tooth flowers!
4603 2018-11-23 21:54:43 Cuz the oil industry has effectively co-opted #vegan rhetoric with the assistance of some folks who genuinely believe themselves to be protecting the planet by using plastic for everything and shipping kale all over the world.
4604 2018-11-23 21:54:42 Most of it supplies crude oil to a refinery at Burnaby, and some other refineries around Anacortes, WA. This same pipeline also moves products such as gasoline & diesel to BC. There are some crude oil exports that could go anywhere in the world, but it is a small volume.
4605 2018-11-23 21:54:41 Exact percentage is unknown, the oil % irrelevant.

4607 2018-11-23 21:54:36 Wow Ed @Longanecker3 thinks that readers of The Hill are too stupid to compare the cost of tubular steel to the cost of drilling an oil well (the steel tariffs amount to only a 2%-4% increase in costs). And tariffs/quotas have nothing to do with the current pipeline constraints.
4608 2018-11-23 21:54:34 Hers a practical solution - Get Spray some WD-40 on a cloth and wipe off the Sudocream. Then get a moist clean cloth to wipe off the WD-40. Finally get another moist clot with Eucalyptus oil to finish it off. May have to do it a couple of times.  
4609 2018-11-23 21:54:31 @FaZeClan you get 1000 exp per oil executive you kill
4610 2018-11-23 21:54:24 What about just working on ending oil subsidies and not purchasing oil from Middle East? Both parties could possibly agree.
4611 2018-11-23 21:54:08 Good grief. How bizarre. I’ve had one of those pressurised bottles of olive oil explode in a cupboard (=huge mess) but who would have thought washing up liquid?!
4612 2018-11-23 21:54:07 Chai this Anty don block me

4614 2018-11-23 21:54:01 venezuelas got lots of oil, booming is it ?
4615 2018-11-23 21:53:47 We only provide 40% of your oil, but yeah ok, you keep kidding yourself.
4616 2018-11-23 21:53:47 4 leases from Congress to drill oil from.  Congress strips safety nets away from people to subsidize billion dollar companies.. their thoughts and prayers are only motions.  I go home at the end of my week wondering if I’m even making a difference.
4617 2018-11-23 21:53:45 1/2 Not really OK with any new pipeline but if one is going to be built I believe less risk of a catastrophic (marine) spill going east. More benefits -  jobs in New Brunswick, less imported oil from Middle East & most of pipeline already built. NIMBY or plain tough choices.
4618 2018-11-23 21:53:34 Awon virgin oil
4619 2018-11-23 21:53:34 Have you looked at the deficit lately? Apparently not. BTW, the only people who benefited from tax cuts were the wealthy. A President who peddles coal & Saudi oil is out of touch with reality. So are those that believe his lies. Let’s see if Mexico pays for border wall.
4620 2018-11-23 21:53:12 True, but what inflation? Trump appears to have no concept of the complexity of the economy. He squeezes the Saudis to give us cheap oil without realizing he is collapsing cash flows for domestic producers and blowing up the debt markets. Should have left Yellen in place.
4621 2018-11-23 21:53:08 Oil is obsolete time to figure it out and built a alternative industry
4622 2018-11-23 21:53:02 Just what did you do to get oil prices so low. |Increased the oil supply from the US through cracking that started with the previous administration and buying very inexpensive Canadian oil.
4623 2018-11-23 21:52:49 Their solutions are behind them   No judgement. No foresight  unfortunate for . Not just oil provinces

4627 2018-11-23 21:52:18 And some people buy snake oil
4628 2018-11-23 21:52:01 Could have more drilling re-focused on land where gas:oil mix is richer given current prices, thus alleviating some of the perception of crude glut. I haven't done the DD on this though. Also, producers could keep pumping uneconomic oil because the NG lift keeps them afloat.
4629 2018-11-23 21:51:53 Whee! Found my blueberry muffin recipe. Only issue now is whether to use butter or avocado oil in the mixture.

4633 2018-11-23 21:51:17 Depends on how you define “yummy”, if it’s w/ SUGAR (or vegetable oil) then YES this is a true statement.
4634 2018-11-23 21:51:17 Until Trump, no American president had anyyhing to actually do with the price of gas.  Then Trump refused to act when when an oil supplier drugged and dismembered an American resident while he was still Alive.  Your driving around with the blood of Americans in your tank!!!
4635 2018-11-23 21:51:13 Fire the economists - the only way oil prices rebound is if OPEC decided and the Saudi's agree.
4636 2018-11-23 21:51:06 i just got home but i forgot i have to go get an oil change and an inspection FUCK
4637 2018-11-23 21:51:03 Supply and demand theory no longer works whether in oil prices or wages it seems.

Well starting your commitment with regime change in Iran to get a better deal on oil has been a long and historic disaster.
4652 2018-11-23 21:49:26 @garymasonglobe Things @JustinTrudeau could do to offer hope to AB (AND Canada)! Withdraw C-69, the bill that will ensure no pipelines are EVER built in Canada. Incentivize a drive to build #EnergyEast in order to use Cdn oil and STOP importing any Saudi oil! That's just a start!

4659 2018-11-23 21:49:02 While I agree with most of what you say I think the US with the help of the Saudis are deliberately driving down the price of oil and have no interest in cutting back their production. Mr. Trump has said he wants the Saudis to keep the price low.
4660 2018-11-23 21:49:00 A country that controls marmara,aegean,the m.east aka the oil and the suez canal...come on...
4661 2018-11-23 21:48:57 Voter suppression in the US today, Trump silencing a "free" press, existence of a patrinomy-enforced gender pay gap, Rosicrucians as satanists, oil companies "covering up" the effects of fossil fuels on climate...

Need I go on?
4662 2018-11-23 21:48:50 Human oil, that’s a good band name
4663 2018-11-23 21:48:45 That’s oil too?
4664 2018-11-23 21:48:31 Wonder if oil decline is related
4665 2018-11-23 21:48:17 The constant anti-semitism about oil execs is illuminating that your ideology is neonazi.   And silly as your desired “fixes” would kill hundreds of millions of people and bankrupt nations not just one economy.
4666 2018-11-23 21:48:09 Jim Hanson thinks we need Saudi's more than they need us, lol. Someone tell him we only get 10% of our oil from them. We get almost half from Canada and Trump baby slapped tariffs on them...why didn't you defend US interests then?!?
4667 2018-11-23 21:48:01 From the same people who screamed peak oil and still don't report fairly about the US' quite natural and unexpected reduction of emissions.
4668 2018-11-23 21:47:58 This oil change got my baby riding hella smooth.
4669 2018-11-23 21:47:55 So, @PnPCBC is about to start. I wonder who @VassyKapelos will ask today for the immediate solution to the decades-in-the-making economic issues in the oil patch that will bring relief and certainty in the next two weeks to everyone affected, and save the environment?
4670 2018-11-23 21:47:48 Love Cadbury, hate the fact they use Palm Oil... 
4671 2018-11-23 21:47:47 Deep breaths....we’ve covered that.
Simple question, was the ‘nationalists believe’ referencing a potential oil boom or a secret field?
4672 2018-11-23 21:47:38 um.... renewables is not an option to fossil fuel. Solar and windmills replacing fossil is not reasonable or possible. Try heating the entire NE United States for a single winter without fossil fuel. Large scale electricity storage is not feasible. Oil is easy and cheap.
4673 2018-11-23 21:47:34 Yes nah why oh why would I add palm oil in my noodles?

4676 2018-11-23 21:47:02 Interesting tidbit:
OPEC has lost what control of the oil market it ever had. The actions (or tweets) of three men — Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman — will determine the course of oil prices in 2019 and beyond.
4677 2018-11-23 21:46:56 It’s not the oil. It the authoritarianism.

Atkeast the Liberian D is better. On the streets of Monrovia, you still have most of the machines dispensing American Dollars. 
4683 2018-11-23 21:46:45 Thank you! I just sprayed Coconut oil on it!
4684 2018-11-23 21:46:44 Westminster are the only ones rubbing there hands, as long as Scotland has oil we will be held in the UK, when it’s finally gone they will dump us.
4685 2018-11-23 21:46:38 That tip that says cover yourself in baby oil and sit for 2+ hours then shower and scrub to get rid of tan has actually changed my life
4686 2018-11-23 21:46:32 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
4687 2018-11-23 21:46:30 Pretty good actually. Because he is a democratic socialist. Like Canada, Norway, and other 1st world nations are. Norway does incredibly well and they have a state owned oil company.
4688 2018-11-23 21:46:27 Quotazioni così basse oil rendono più difficile un rialzo dell’inflazione, che Draghi persegue da anni senza riuscirvi. Trump più volte negli ultimi mesi è intervenuto per reclamare prezzi oil più bassi. Interessi divergenti. Pop corn.
4689 2018-11-23 21:46:23 Stop using their oil!
4690 2018-11-23 21:46:20 No they didn’t, they scoffed at the idea of a ‘secret’ field. Cameron even went and visited Shetland to look at where the oil would come ashore....in what way is that denying its existence?
4691 2018-11-23 21:46:11 We’re staying in an AirBnB in Cold Spring that rests over a combination barbershop & craft beer bar, I’m *this close* to throwing in the publishing towel, buying a sheep, and becoming a professional hiker and beard oil maker.
4692 2018-11-23 21:46:09 I survived #BlackFriday2018 because I know a snake oil sales pitch when it knocks on my door. I'm not falling for your marketing con. I saved my money for what I need to buy & not what you want to sell. #BlackFriday
4693 2018-11-23 21:45:56 I was talking to some dude about Frank Rizzo’s curling stone paperweight ($20), and he goes “yeah I’ve always wanted to curl… (turns to worker) yeah I’ll take this oil painting.” For $1750!
4694 2018-11-23 21:45:56 I cannot vote...they were being allowed to do it when oil was at $150 a barrel.
4695 2018-11-23 21:45:40 @cbcallinaday A barrel of oil is now cheaper than a bucket of chicken.
4696 2018-11-23 21:45:39 He didnt buy it to get it going. P.e.t started Petrocan as a federal oil company. But what good is an oil company without a pipeline? You cant tell me jr doesnt still own suncor shares in his portfolio...he bought the pipeline to own the oil fr hole to port. Gives the "appearance
4697 2018-11-23 21:45:36 You cant be proud of a name that carries bad omen. An economy with an illegitimate head of state and govt. A country where soldiers murder civilians and hd of state arrest none. An economy where u have to spnd d whole day if not a wk looking for fuel c.oil. nothing to b proud of.
4698 2018-11-23 21:45:34 Haaaa how will I add extra palm oil in my noodles nah  I’m not even the one that cooked it sef
4699 2018-11-23 21:45:32 anyone wanna get me an oil change for christmas? im about a year overdue
4700 2018-11-23 21:45:28 Gold diggers dig, until they find oil
4701 2018-11-23 21:45:27 Canada is selling its crude oil for few $$$ to USA.
4702 2018-11-23 21:45:27 Groundnut oil?
Soya?
Vegetable?
Engine?
4703 2018-11-23 21:45:23 I just got some new oil and I don’t know how to act. dey smell bombbbbb 
4704 2018-11-23 21:45:21 Household items for the looooww. For example 100% pure refined coconut oil 32 is for $12 whereas I’ve searched amazon and other stores and it’s so much more expensive. Big Lots is my go to for household essentials and toiletries
4705 2018-11-23 21:45:05 Today has been a shit day.

So after I picked up my car from its oil change, I drove around town and angry washed my car.

Then I came home, indulged in hot chocolate and cream crackers, and for hugs from my mom and sister.

I feel better now.
4706 2018-11-23 21:45:03 No wonder we’re tanking in stocks

1. GDP going to be 1-1.5  % in 2019
2. Fed raising rates 6-8 times in 2019 to 6-7 %
3. Global economy going down by 20-30%
4. Trump going to increase Tariffs  on China by 45%
5. Oil going to $30 a barrel in 2019
4707 2018-11-23 21:44:57 Gross
4708 2018-11-23 21:44:49 No. It’s on their land. The fish swim the sea, maybe at times in, maybe at time out of UK waters.
We could just give them our whisky although our peat bogs are 30% the size of the Amazon. Reason we have whisky!
Or our oil, that has got the UK out of the shit for years!
4709 2018-11-23 21:44:47 Well, he needs a new source of income since the oil will be done in 11 years time.
4710 2018-11-23 21:44:46 But this oil field is fake news, that's what we were told in 2014.
So not a global warming issue.
Feel like Trump typing that, yuck.
4711 2018-11-23 21:44:44 Is this a new thing, or something am I just now noticing them refer to Edmonton as "The Oil"? It's driving me nuts
4712 2018-11-23 21:44:35 On Thanksgiving They say you are to give Thanks for Being Grateful.  Well Trump Did on National T.V.  While The U.S. Drills & Produces  90% Of it's Own Oil to Keep Prices Low-----TRUMP THANKS SAUDI ARABIA  FOR OUR HARD WORK.. 
(TRUMP) -- Your a FUCKIN Disgrace..
4713 2018-11-23 21:44:33 In almost the exact same situation as you. 
Recently bought myself a vape and have been using CBD oil as a substitute. Helped me cut back to a level I'm more comfortable with. I find it eases that anxious feeling when you aren't smoking and helps with sleep too. Good luck sir
4714 2018-11-23 21:44:28 Haha! Might as well be in oil today
4715 2018-11-23 21:44:23 Uncle would wait until last minute to get an oil change 
4716 2018-11-23 21:44:19 No cos it is opportune time to make a deal of which is now done and dusted. Keep oil prices low check the stats business is business its frigging disgraceful
4717 2018-11-23 21:44:12 Listen, if you talk about secret oil fields that are being widely reported then do you expect people to take you seriously?
Why call them secret? They weren’t, so why?
4718 2018-11-23 21:44:10 I don't know why we care
4719 2018-11-23 21:43:51 Perhaps temporarily. Read the article, part of the reason for the drop in oil prices is "oversupply" - and part of the so-called "bottleneck" is because supposedly safe pipelines have to run at reduced capacity because they keep having spills.
4720 2018-11-23 21:43:51 Buenísimo! Ahora que se produce más hay que seguir subsidiando las petroleras que están invirtiendo en el país!. Aprovechemos que desde máx el Oil bajo 35% y peguemos otro aumentazo de 10%.!!
4721 2018-11-23 21:43:48 40 years ago Peter Lougheed's government (PCs) set aside significant funds + began diversification policies so oil + gas wouldn't be the province's only economic engine + maybe to defend against feds (led by JT's dad). 

PL's PC successors messed up.

Can someone tell that story?
4722 2018-11-23 21:43:37 BBC says the price of oil is going down... typical of them.
4723 2018-11-23 21:43:31 I just paid 70 for a oil change....did i get played?
4724 2018-11-23 21:43:18 " does not cover prescription drugs" FFS that is nothing like the NHS you can get gluten free food or sun cream oil free on it classed as a prescription drug
4725 2018-11-23 21:43:16 Margaret is a  life scientist that likes Sesame oil on their ham pizza with red wine
4726 2018-11-23 21:43:06 You can gargle coconut oil mixed with water or salt water with clove essential oil, or other essential oils. Also using topically behind your ears, on your glands throat and chest. I highly recommend clove, eucalyptus, cypress, myrrh and peppermint.
4727 2018-11-23 21:42:57 I got my an oil change today and the man there asked me if I knew what a tire rotation was. What a world we live in folks!
4728 2018-11-23 21:42:51 In Crude Oil’s Huge Drop, All Signs Say Made in the U.S.A.
The downward spiral in oil prices is accelerating as a surge in crude production from a turbocharged U.S. petroleum industry runs into weaker global economic growth. Biggest Decline in 3 Years.  51 DOLARES hoy @miresto
4729 2018-11-23 21:42:49 It’s not the price of oil that is killing Alberta you morons, it’s that we have only one customer because this country is run by college activists.
4730 2018-11-23 21:42:47 I mean don't they already, oh wait you wanted advice eh like he'd listen to anything except massive donations or a personal oil baron funding him
4731 2018-11-23 21:42:46 CSIR estimate that there are 11 billion barrels of Oil along the coast of KZN (from Richards Bay to Port Shepstone). Why are we not build Oil refinery in KZN @radebe_jeff
4732 2018-11-23 21:42:37 The more educated, the dumber. It’s not enough that humans destroy every natural resource on earth...pollute the water, the air, take the oil (what keeps the earth from imploding) from the earth, kill animals for sport and mow down the rainforest...let’s kill the sun. 
4733 2018-11-23 21:42:22 Man I got all kinds of shit in my hair. Oil, coolant, power steering fluid, dirt. Smh cuh
4734 2018-11-23 21:42:18 Not a very fun first. They kept talking about the crippling injuries for Anaheim, and then the Oil kept getting worse.
4735 2018-11-23 21:42:00 And CH has Lots of billionaires, Swiss vote to cut taxes all the time.
Davos puts politicians in world wide to do their corporate bidding.  
They just did oil price drop to F with Extinction Rebellion.
Poison Gift low prices now, mark my words.
4736 2018-11-23 21:41:47 What hyperbole. 

The impossible was promised. It’s not a failure of democracy when reality lands

The failure was allowing such snake oil to be traded in the first place
4737 2018-11-23 21:41:32 Oh brother with your protection of the fossil fuel and big oil industries. How about we tackle climate change by eliminating those greedy polluters and switching to renewables?
4738 2018-11-23 21:41:30 Nothing like a free oil change!
4739 2018-11-23 21:41:29 Umm hi NorCal people this rain is crazy and I almost spun out on the road today from making a (safe) turn and I was going slow too !!! Just drive rly careful out there be safe the oil on the roads rn are crazy
4740 2018-11-23 21:41:24 @TheBodyShop I have a question. I used to use Almond Oil Hand Rescue treatment, which is no longer available. Is it under another name? Or is it gone? I tried the hand and manicure cream, but that is NOT the same at all.  Thanks!
4741 2018-11-23 21:41:23 We need to keep asking the Why questions. Why is Trump willing to go to such great lengths to protect MbS? It’s more than the $$. We buy more oil from Canada. Someone else will buy the weapons, maybe a few more Yemeni children will see their next birthday. Demand an answer.

4747 2018-11-23 21:41:00 How you always come up with critical questions and solid comments amazes me. Surely oil must dey your head. Kindly follow back
4748 2018-11-23 21:40:58 But everyone knows that if that huge reserve of oil sells for less than $113 a barrel that the money should go to Westminster to be frittered away. It's only fair.

Iran is a good example; one that makes an absolute joke of the pro-democracy rhetoric we hear from foreign policy wonks. They elected a leader in the 50's who wanted to put country's oil wealth to work for its citizens, then..

4765 2018-11-23 21:39:32 Canada and Mexico each supply us with more oil than Saudi Arabia.   Yet, Trump sabotages our relationships with our neighboring countries.
4766 2018-11-23 21:39:19 , so true, as long as we take oil and refine it into gasoline, we are sort of Saudis bitches.

4771 2018-11-23 21:38:41 While cruise speed for a carrier group is a bit under what container ships do, carriers can and do perform a fair bit of higher speed maneuvering. At 30+ knots they'd be sucking down bunker oil at a very brisk clip indeed.

4773 2018-11-23 21:38:39 I take offence to your tweet, my wife is in the oil and gas industry and she has post secondary education. She worked hard to get where she is. A lot of the oil field workers came from all parts of Canada not just Alberta. Get over your jealousy.

4779 2018-11-23 21:38:13 I am merely pointing out, if it is deemed too late to stop by their scientists, they could essentially be like Slim Pickens riding the climate change bomb in Dr. Strangelove. Of course the greenhouse gases are a consequence of big oil.

4790 2018-11-23 21:37:21 Yes, a minutiae. And you're flat out lying in claiming otherwise.
"Christians support oil companies" False. Christians support the right to do business and use raw materials to do so. Oil companies aren't inherently bad. And people of all backgrounds support them. Irrelevant.

4813 2018-11-23 21:35:19 yeah but back then probably 1000s of homes and acres of land weren’t being incinerated in CA by wildfires. also 20+ years ago major oil companies did their own studies coming to the same conclusion about climate change existing/being real.
4814 2018-11-23 21:35:10 @Valvoline was wondering if after 120,000 miles you still service cars for oil changes?
4815 2018-11-23 21:35:08 I hope their bloody oil will be worth floating for
4816 2018-11-23 21:34:58 yALL SAID OIL???????? *US army busts down door*
4817 2018-11-23 21:34:56 it's possible all this is a cycle, so we better do nothing and keep letting billionaire oil execs profit off of it in case this is all actually okay despite evidence pointing to the contrary. I mean, they tell us it's fine so it's probably fine. Solid logic, guy
4818 2018-11-23 21:34:55 Better than the wars we do for oil
4819 2018-11-23 21:34:22 wearing rosemary essential oil as cologne
4820 2018-11-23 21:34:19 Different problem then.  Low statutory grain hauling rates meant the railways were losing money hauling grain. Not so with oil today, in fact just the opposite. CN and CP can lease more oil cars and engines anytime they want and make money hauling oil.

4823 2018-11-23 21:33:40 11/23 The price of crude oil has just fallen by over $3 again today. This is good for the consumers but is detrimental to our oil workers as they need to make a profit in order to stay employed.  #oilprices #economics

4826 2018-11-23 21:33:26 I set up a nice triage area for situations just like this. Lori did it work well for you?? Did you like the essential oil diffuser I installed to calm the nerves?? @LorraineB2112

4833 2018-11-23 21:32:47 Trump praising low oil prices he think is from the Saudis well Canadians who are actually selling the oil are freaking out due to the of price drop, what a weird time to be alive.
4834 2018-11-23 21:32:44 That’s what we all expected we were sold snake oil
4835 2018-11-23 21:32:44 Those kooky conservatives can’t wait for Scheer-ia law to come into effect. Everything oil industry related will flow like the lies from their great leader’s lips.
4836 2018-11-23 21:32:38 Oil Prices Hit A New Low. Here's Why That Might Be A Bad Thing
4837 2018-11-23 21:32:25 Agreed. I think the general market has further to fall though. 

I’m going for Apple when it falls from the tree. 

So I’ll hold off until there is oil in the streets ...... 

But seriously some way to go yet me thinks.
4838 2018-11-23 21:32:15 You right, It’s called Giardiniera peppers. It’s a blend of mess in oil but so good 
4839 2018-11-23 21:32:08 People better be careful not to jump from the frying pan into the fire. From oil dependence to lithium dependence.
4840 2018-11-23 21:32:03 YALL, THEY’RE BRINGING RAMON AYALA TO THE OIL PALACE IN DECEMBER 
4841 2018-11-23 21:32:00 Cheaper oil/gas a blessing to $fdx $ups like airlines IMO - mix that with this chart and could be a nice move!!

4843 2018-11-23 21:31:52 Have you had any CBT? You can access help through the employee assistance line through your trust. 

Otherwise essential oil rubbed into the palms, cupped over your nose and take 10 deep breaths. 

There’s also the ‘what me worry?’ course that may help.

4845 2018-11-23 21:31:44 Oil sands production doesn’t affect the world oil price.
4846 2018-11-23 21:31:24 We prefer Iran oil and  Afghanistan oil, in exchange of weapons
4847 2018-11-23 21:31:16 Thank U. 
Opinion: makes sense Trump would replace him with someone who is desired by big oil=where the big $ & real gov decisions have been made starting many administrations back. Super PAC $=Trump subservient puppet 4 them in so many ways?
4848 2018-11-23 21:31:08 Please let me know if this palm fruit is the same as what they grow for palm oil ? I am opposed to deforestation and loss of habitat, and the whole industry that saves a few dollars for multi-national companies? Just asking to find the truth. Thanks
4849 2018-11-23 21:30:58 MGF not only saves the environment but it does a fabulous job cleaning clothes. The essential oil scents are delightful!! LOVE the products!
4850 2018-11-23 21:30:54 "The British people", "the British people", what is it with politician's like May? Are they mind readers or snake oil salesmen? If she means Leave voters, she should say so, and not turn 17 million into 60 million.

4852 2018-11-23 21:30:51 That Clair field that was well into redevelopment in 2014 with a whole new rig in build in South Korea? No, I don’t think so. 

Still, just as well the Scottish people didn’t believe the SNPs promises of bountiful $113 a barrel oil.
4853 2018-11-23 21:30:32 What research on the policy that was done to ban oil and gas exploration
4854 2018-11-23 21:30:24 We all know why. Oil
4855 2018-11-23 21:30:19 I’d be outraged no matter the profession, whether they were an American resident or not. I’ll gladly pay more for oil (better yet put our US $ towards renewable energy). Too, trump’s attack on MSM is unacceptable. He’s trying to get us comfortable w/ murder. Not gonna happen.
4856 2018-11-23 21:30:17 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
4857 2018-11-23 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
4858 2018-11-23 21:30:11 So Saudi Arabia, a country awash in oil now wants nuclear technology just so they can build "nuclear power plants", but not nuclear weapons. Yeah, we all believe that...
4859 2018-11-23 21:30:09 @BBCScotlandNews @BBCBreaking @BBCNews @BBCGaryR Its what to expect from BBC while everyone else wants to invest, The BBC starts with a negative. No mention im sure of massive finds and over 40 years of gas and oil, DITCH THE BBC FEE GET RID OF THEM
4860 2018-11-23 21:30:08 Probably, never tried anything else. The original commercial hobnob, contains palm oil not butter. This recipe gives the hobnob flavour without palm oil, so the hobnob flavour is from the other ingredients, so a vegan version is feasible. Hope that makes sense.
4861 2018-11-23 21:30:06 I just deep fried a sweet potato in peanut oil and I must say, not bad.
4862 2018-11-23 21:30:03 Then for moisturizer I used either olive oil or any thick creamy moisturizer. In my opinion, the biggest help was the pure aloe Vera gel straight from the leaf. A lot of ppl use it as a mask and wash it off but I put it on and left it on morning and night!
4863 2018-11-23 21:30:03 You said all available to troops as if they're truly available, didn't you hear what the soldier was complaining of, there's a lot that's not okay, how can troops in front line be out of amou, there should be no excuse for that lackadaisical attitude.
4864 2018-11-23 21:29:51 Except that Kenney also blamed the federal Liberals for not “convincing” USA to approve even though tories failed as well. Also that oil is sold to the US. Does not open a new market to us and keeps the same Ol price differential issues.
4865 2018-11-23 21:29:40 Republicans say they're all about jobs & national security. Why not then support green tech like solar, wind, geothermal & hydroelectric while reducing dependency on foreign oil? Keep the money in the U.S., create jobs & while we're at it, we'll have cleaner air & greener planet.
4866 2018-11-23 21:29:39 The biker bloke chatting mavis wilton up in the rovers return with half a shandy waiting for him MacDonald to get him a oil pump for his bike
4867 2018-11-23 21:29:30 Its worth noting that $amrn only has a third of the fish oil market and could almost become a blockbuster just squeezing out generic lovaza without growing the market at all.
4868 2018-11-23 21:29:13 Vitalite does contain palm oil but it is from sustainable sources. Not sure of your stance on that! It is the best vegan spread I’ve found taste wise! X
4869 2018-11-23 21:29:13 これは仙台駅前ですねー。東北に住んでるので必然lvが宮城になるんです。
4870 2018-11-23 21:29:09 What do you wanna be when you grow up?

I want to become a billionaire to use political power & money to push the world torward sustainability, join Government, push sustainable regulations, buy cleared Amazon Rainforest land, convert it into a hemp haven & take down Big Oil. Hbu
4871 2018-11-23 21:29:02 It's red oil that stains the hand red, but nowadays they steal from where there are no red oil, so to wait till one is caught red handed is not to want to catch anyone that has stolen. So don't use the red hand as the red line any longer 

J. O.
4872 2018-11-23 21:29:01 It's not even logical. Saudis have zero leverage over us. All they have is oil, proximity to the Gulf and a shared dislike of Iran. We have oil, we're moving toward an economy less dependent on oil, we have other friends in the Middle East, and we and Israel can take care of Iran
4873 2018-11-23 21:28:54 Chapped lips make me feel uncomfortable like.. olive oil and sugar scrub... use it please 
4874 2018-11-23 21:28:52 And don't bring gas into this, it is doing fine. Only worthless tar oil is dying. Nothing can save it.
Try being a leader for a change.
4875 2018-11-23 21:28:47 Yeah I know, also somewhere out there could be some hidden sleeping losses in fund,  oil down 30% in 7 weeks, Apple the same. Probably a lot of leveraged losses too. Just amazing the moves.
4876 2018-11-23 21:28:46 Yep that oil would all be used up and that trees were all gonna die along with fish.  I remember well.  At least, my school taughtbus how to debate.
4877 2018-11-23 21:28:40 illicit oil shipments? US can't decide where syria gets oil.Only US occupation of syrias oil fields is illegal
4878 2018-11-23 21:28:37 He cut my taxes, got oil prices down, made our economy boom, cut regulations, securing our borders, boosting military spending, taking care of our vets finally, got unemployment to its lowest since the 60s, he’s done so much OPEN YOUR EYES.
4879 2018-11-23 21:28:37 MBS also wants to placate Trump following Khashoggi murder, and Trump said he wants lower oil/gas prices. I think the Saudis learned their lesson about trying to squeeze out shale in 2014, and expect this won't be such a drastic production boost.
4880 2018-11-23 21:28:27 If you know how to extract oil from plants please send me a message. Thank you
4881 2018-11-23 21:28:25 Venezuela went bankrupt because of oil prices. You should try a little more aptitude and a little less attitude.
4882 2018-11-23 21:28:20 Parents asked what I wanted for Black Friday and all I asked for was an oil change and gas. This is what it feels like to be an adult.
4883 2018-11-23 21:28:09 Baby all I used was a cleanser called Exuviance and put it on an exfoliating glove. Then I toned my face with Dickinson’s toner. Then I used aloe Vera gel straight from the leaf and smeared that bad boy all over. Followed by tea tree oil on bumps and ambi fade cream on dark marks
4884 2018-11-23 21:28:00 Soooooo...you are bragging about getting oil ALMOST back to the price it was when you first took office?  Ummm, congrats?

4886 2018-11-23 21:27:47 Big oil
4887 2018-11-23 21:27:43 Keep pushing it lower and you will lose big oil support. Don’t kill the market.
4888 2018-11-23 21:27:37 We will win, but we have to be clever!
Look at just one of the lies bitter together spewed in 2014, no oil left!
Yet first lot of the next 40years landed at Sulom Voe today!
Expect bitter together to get worse because of the revenue from it!
4889 2018-11-23 21:27:33 @justintrudeau @EC_minister @liberal_party

So, what are you doing about climate change? Seems like you're working for the oil industry and willing to kill us all. US government climate change report...warns of devastating economic and health impact...dire consequences....
4890 2018-11-23 21:27:29 Why does Google news update inform me of Justin Beiber being a married man instead of imp news?
I.e. that momentum refused to pay out life cover, or that oil is entering the 7th consec week of an all time low. 
Why do Celebs trump all else? 
Where is the world heading?
4891 2018-11-23 21:27:23 no man coconut oil cant be the one ...
4892 2018-11-23 21:27:21 Your a Republican not a Democrat. You are a climate denier.
Y ou u take money from oil and insurance companies.
No change is what we are getting.
4893 2018-11-23 21:27:19 Given that the price of a barrel of oil has dropped 33% in just over a month, from a high of $86.6 barrel down to todays price $58.6 barrel. 1-2p is disgusting..
4894 2018-11-23 21:27:17 This game is no oil painting, but nobody dare leave early!
4895 2018-11-23 21:27:15 DANG LIKE HOW CAN YOU STOP THOSE TWO MASSIV MONSTERS FROM STICKING THEIR TUBES IN EACH OTHER?

ngl I‘d kill myself on the spot
4896 2018-11-23 21:27:13 In percentage terms, it is small enough to keep us secure from arbitrary withdrawal and large enough to get us a significant employment opportunity.  For every ten oil worker currently employed, you will meet at least 3 newly employed person working either in a new oil firm or...
4897 2018-11-23 21:27:12 むんっ！（召喚口上）次はからすかもしれませんね。
4898 2018-11-23 21:26:49 80% of oil we use comes from the USA. 11% from Saudi Arabia. PrimaDonald what is it exactly that you have done? And FYI low crude oil prices negatively affect the economy.
4899 2018-11-23 21:26:46 I’m commissioning a regal oil painting of Kermit, this will be passed down for generations
4900 2018-11-23 21:26:30 And that has to do with inept federal policies ruining the ability of the oil industry ? Believe this - Norway has a Trillion$ in the bank from Oil.  Canada has more oil and is a Trillion in debt and climbing.
4901 2018-11-23 21:26:17 Not minutiae. The vast majority. Now Christians support oil companies in not doing anything about climate change because of their deluded belief that we can't change gods world, dooming millions if not billions.
4902 2018-11-23 21:26:12 @MotherwellFC it will be tough but we should still welcome the oil / cod noshing tory c*nts from the north east.
4903 2018-11-23 21:26:11 When talking with climate deniers, focus on the basics first.
Carbon in trees (coal, oil) mfg’d from CO2 in air. 
(Photosynthesis ->sugars ->cellulose)
Trees, coal, oil store Carbon
Burning adds CO2 to air. (Ind Rev)
Higher temps linked to more CO2 in air.
Then let it sink in.
4904 2018-11-23 21:26:08 Well that would be a totally different discussion... once we solve the Alberta oil fiasco.
4905 2018-11-23 21:26:00 My hands are free to give you a hot oil full body massage girl .....to ease that tension! Yummy 
4906 2018-11-23 21:25:58 If oil goes any lower you will shut down my business and lose a supporter. Be careful not to crash the market please
4907 2018-11-23 21:25:51 Aw, you guys are so sweet! . I said iScotland would get 100% of oil & gas in its own waters , pre 1999 borders. Likewise other countries. Can you argue against it , or just want to attack ad-hominen?

4910 2018-11-23 21:25:40 No, no, they are relaxing regulations and allowing those pay day loan people to make up crazy rates towards folks. 
They can do stuff. They can let the laws that are already there stay in place. 

They are doing the same with the deep water oil platform regulations.
4911 2018-11-23 21:25:37 You’ve heard of a “snake oil salesman”, right? Yeah, you’re about 3 steps below that.
4912 2018-11-23 21:25:37 Start telling them that Canada provides 40% of USA oil imports compared to 11% from Saudi, so if you get too pissed off you'll tax the shit out of it. Double talk will ensue.
4913 2018-11-23 21:25:28 Happy to report that oil has dropped in price by about 30% lately.Only way to go.
4914 2018-11-23 21:25:25 He’s a snake oil salesman and they bought into his bullshit!  Now they can’t admit they screwed up and were hoodwinked, and that’s what he’s counted on snd still is!

4918 2018-11-23 21:25:00 Oil constitutes 10% of our GDP, the document intends to make FDI…that is direct investment by foreigners… Foreign companies directly entering into the nation with their money, to contribute 2.5% of GDP, #GNWA #TheAtikuPlan
4919 2018-11-23 21:24:52 Are you saying that death is required for profits, or that we shouldn't expect big oil to help the required deaths?
4920 2018-11-23 21:24:51 Good Americams are smart driving on oil slick roads 
- and - 
Most Good Americans can spot a slick oil salesman.

You, Putin & MBS are slick oil salesmen.
4921 2018-11-23 21:24:41 When oil tanked in 2014 it took a good year before the layoffs really starting hitting hard, if something doesn't change could see it happen again for sure
4922 2018-11-23 21:24:37 Well, you know, supply management not OK for milk but it is OK for oil. Just sayin'
4923 2018-11-23 21:24:34 So let's see:
Scientists who make as much money as you do have an "agenda" when denying global climate change, but a Saudi-Big-Oil-owned "news channel" paying Hannity $50M is telling the "truth."

Hook, line, sinker.

And you brag about that ignorance in public.
4924 2018-11-23 21:24:32 Look whos talking!! You gave George W. Bush a pass after knowing that he mess-lead not just the Americans but the whole entire world to wage a war on Iraq for their OIL !!

4929 2018-11-23 21:24:04 @FoxNews It said on Fox news, oil is down 23% this month.I wonder if I might get Fox to take just that 10 second chuck of information & send it to Oil companies here in the USA? So  the  news can get to all their Distributors & stations by Monday? Hate to think they miss Fox news

4933 2018-11-23 21:23:33 Did mention anything anout what damage oil extraction is doing to the planet?
4934 2018-11-23 21:23:28 I hate getting an oil change.

4940 2018-11-23 21:23:09 So we have to hand public money to rich corporations to profit from Canadian production in order to have tax money to invest in renewable conversion? I think cutting out the middle man and letting oil fix outs own business might be easier.
4941 2018-11-23 21:22:57 agree... in ways, the 'oil patch' is to AB as the 'real estate lottery win' is to BC. Both fact to be dealt with/neither natural or sustainable, and in both cases, many folks got very used to as 'normal' and sometimes, had children who grew up to think it's a given.
4942 2018-11-23 21:22:53 CBD oil is trash it doesn’t wok for me
4943 2018-11-23 21:22:52 You really need help.  Mother Nature has shown the changes already.  Don’t be ignorant.  You’re not wrong that oil companies have controlled policy and have made this into a political fight.  Don’t be dumb.
4944 2018-11-23 21:22:50 Ah, yes. Let's dim the sun instead of cutting back oil usage. A grade a plan that will definitely go exactly as planned & not cause massive famines.
4945 2018-11-23 21:22:32 No chemicals NATURAL stuff ONLY !
Aloe plant 
Avocado 
Cocoanut oil 
She’s butter 
Black soap 
Vitamin E oil 
Tea Tree oil 
Water 
& your diet is everything !!!!
4946 2018-11-23 21:22:28 lol, locked out? No the rest of the world knows tar oil will be worthless in seven years or less. lol
Stop whining long enough to get a friggin clue.
4947 2018-11-23 21:22:19 Psst yea who needs oil that stuff is dirty
4948 2018-11-23 21:22:17 If one commodity can have 2 prices - one in CNY (which is convertible under the oil contract) & one in USD - I'm all ears how we'll be able to violate a basic law of economics (law of one price).
4949 2018-11-23 21:22:01 А может она по приколу пишет? Я вот поорала с ее твитов
4950 2018-11-23 21:21:51 Please point out the ridiculous hypocrisy from Trump in that 40% of oil imports are from Canada BUT tariffs on Canadian steel is a matter of "nation security" for America even after Trump renamed NAFTA.
4951 2018-11-23 21:21:48 Thank you for your Wisdom. I bought an oil change.
4952 2018-11-23 21:21:26 Never said oil wasn’t necessary...especially when using 10 year old electric heaters...but bears like to play up issues (drama queens)...
4953 2018-11-23 21:21:20 40% of the oil America consumes each year comes from Canada. More specifically from the oil pipelines and companies routed through Cal.... and it just hit me I’m mansplaining...
4954 2018-11-23 21:21:20 That’s the general idea behind a Green New Deal.  Massive investments in training and jobs to expand solar and wind power. Imagine retraining former coal miners to put carbon back in the ground instead of taking it out, oil pipe layers building solar farms and electric grids, etc
4955 2018-11-23 21:21:02 Allah yasa Sukuma suyi aikin hankali ranar Zabe bahaukaba
4956 2018-11-23 21:20:55 Dependable oil? I’ll take it. Great for the lawnmower, or cooking etc etc
4957 2018-11-23 21:20:52 In the biz of #Chatbots & wonder who owns the data? How about the users who contribute to the perpetual edification process in exchange for an ephemeral reward? Should they also inherit a fraction of it. 
#AI #Chatbots can contribute to democratizing the new oil. 
@pandorabots
4958 2018-11-23 21:20:48 THEN. STOP. OVERPRODUCING. LOW VALUE. OIL.
4959 2018-11-23 21:20:37 My peepee look like poopoo
4960 2018-11-23 21:20:37 @SenJackReed COME ON MAN...YOU KNOW TRUMP WANTS WHAT IS "BEST" FOR HIS AND OUR COUNTRY....TO KEEP SAUDI ARABIA AS A MORE OR LESS "FRIEND" FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS & A LOWER PRICE OF OIL..& HELP IN DEALING WITH A WORSE "SATAN"...IRAN.  B A PATRIOT...B SMART, PLEASE.
4961 2018-11-23 21:20:32 Your moral bankruptcy on full display today.  Jobs and oil are not the be-all and end-all of our great nation.  Why do we need to try to remind you and the @GOP of this????
4962 2018-11-23 21:20:31 my dad is telling me i need cbd oil for my anxiety when in reality i just need a new cart :(
4963 2018-11-23 21:20:29 @YorkshireWater why does the entire downstairs of my house smell of oil/white spirit. LS26
4964 2018-11-23 21:20:28 Apparently I mis spoke I voted republican but not for trump the gov of Ohio trump is a con man if we’re the 1800 he be selling Snake oil salesmen to me the next two years is not going to be anything but trump angry because of the rule of law

4967 2018-11-23 21:20:16 That’s why our oil is worth 60% less the the going rate??? You are as smart as Trudeau.
4968 2018-11-23 21:20:15 Do you not care, Nathan, that the BBC said oil will run out NEXT YEAR, whereas in reality the oil companies say they will be working for the next 40 years? 
Can you see why the BBC news is so distrusted nowadays?
4969 2018-11-23 21:20:14 MyGen is top 5 at the moment and will eventually be the biggest tidal power source globally, but ok, we're not. Just like we don't do district heating, or study alternative oil use, or generate a substantial proportion of our requirements from renewables. Its all about the oil 
4970 2018-11-23 21:20:12 Its not about the oil. The oil is trump's cover for his blatant corruption. Repulsive.
4971 2018-11-23 21:20:07 2/ Then, having obtained those, the then Liberal government sold the ready-to-go project to Standard Oil and Bechel. That's the pipeline that is still delivering AB oil to "tidewater". The problem with Conservatives is that they're never interested in facts.
4972 2018-11-23 21:20:04 I did read up on it, it would seem they sell the oil to the US, however I'm not sure as to the numbers.
4973 2018-11-23 21:19:56 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
4974 2018-11-23 21:19:44 I’m safe from a yarn related incident, as I’ve already had an essential oil related incident. 
4975 2018-11-23 21:19:44 @AldiUK - you’ve led the way with recycling and sourcing local produce. 
How far on are your plans for removing palm oil from all Aldi products?
4976 2018-11-23 21:19:36 You really have a lot to learn. Unless we reduce consumption, then stopping Canadian production is worse than useless because it gets replaced by oil from places who are lot less sensitive about the environment than Canada. The difference is not `minuscule'.
4977 2018-11-23 21:19:32 And what do you call @ARahmanARazaq's cocaine addiction?

Integrity? 

Let's not even start on his oil subsidy thievery (which is the reason he hates Saraki for blowing the whistle on oil subsidy thieves)
4978 2018-11-23 21:19:27 Homeless is a crisis, climate change is a crisis, opiate deaths are a crisis. The oil price differential is being over exaggerated and it is due to poor business decisions by the industry l.
4979 2018-11-23 21:19:20 I accidentally bought the protein pancake mix where you have to add eggs, milk and oil instead of the just add water one and honestly I’m pretty pissed #FirstWorldProblems 
4980 2018-11-23 21:19:11 I think it’s too late Asian buyers have Saudi and Venezuelan oil. China is securing a line from Middle East through Pakistan and China. Time for diversity
4981 2018-11-23 21:19:06 Is wrong for to ask for an oil change, groceries, cleaning supplies, and a full tank of gas for Christmas…asking for a friend
4982 2018-11-23 21:19:04 Why #IBM is so concerned about coffee really coming from Kenya? I like Vietnamese one. Just smell the coffee, taste it and if you like it relax and drink it. And please sto bs-ing with this #blockchain snake oil.

4985 2018-11-23 21:18:57 Sounds good as I was left with numerous oil paintings done by my dad this would be a befitting tribute to his work to show it off to the public. Providing they would agree to it
4986 2018-11-23 21:18:57 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
4987 2018-11-23 21:18:56 Quite a day for crude oil which in Brent terms is now US $59.22 or down over 5% on the day. This will be a big change for inflation as it is the first time in 2018 the price has been below 2017. Usually it has been much higher.
4988 2018-11-23 21:18:51 Get well soon! Oil of Oregano works wonders!
4989 2018-11-23 21:18:42 CBD oil is the real deal.

4991 2018-11-23 21:18:36 I’ve been easing onto the essential oil bandwagon this year and I’m way too excited about the whitening toothpaste I just ordered that’s infused with oils 
4992 2018-11-23 21:18:25 He hates Oil but he hates the WEST more!
4993 2018-11-23 21:18:14 Yes just 40 to 50 years after they claim. The same time Norway has built up a nice we fund on the back of their oil.
It was terrible reporting during a major political period.
See big Brexit bus or the vow for more examples.
4994 2018-11-23 21:18:11 The Oil companies didn’t suddenly choose to close three pipelines that were already approved? What the hell are you talking about? These people are enraged at the hypocrisy of the liberal government
4995 2018-11-23 21:18:11 i bought a jar of coconut oil at tilly's black friday is a success

5000 2018-11-23 21:17:57 Oils a hit topic so I’ll throw my hat in the ring. 

I’d been tweeting oil will go to 10 WTI and it’s not for the reason consensus thinks but rather geopolitical. 

ME principles and US wants Russia to leave Syria so they give an ultimatum, stay and have a cash shortage
5001 2018-11-23 21:17:52 Oil bounce could inform crypto
5002 2018-11-23 21:17:46 Го бузину курить
5003 2018-11-23 21:17:46 You are correct. But, we’ve been cap in hand for funds while the oil & gas money funds tax breaks for the rich, the city of London, illegal wars....
5004 2018-11-23 21:17:41 It's not as easy as you'd think, I've been looking for palm oil free shampoos and soaps there's nothing in my area, which is a small town.
5005 2018-11-23 21:17:39 Good one. I was thinking this today. Beto can easily beat Trump if he takes a moderate position on oil, which he will.
5006 2018-11-23 21:17:39 Oil companies usually big up the "oil in place" figure. The ultimate recovery is more likely to be 25-40% of that. 50% would be exceptional. There's also the cost of operating it - currently probably around $20/bbl (may be a little out of date).  Still a boatload of money though.
5007 2018-11-23 21:17:39 It is ok to Lie for Economic growth. POTUS wants to Keep OiL prices LoW and Win Next Term too. Dream on.
5008 2018-11-23 21:17:37 Tomorrow Grant Fagerheim, President/CEO of Whitecap Resources Inc in Calgary joins me on what Canada's oil/energy sector absolutely requires to grow and return to driving Canada's economy forward.
5009 2018-11-23 21:17:29 Fact!
5010 2018-11-23 21:17:28 Kid Sweden said Oil Free in 20 years we might be ok.
5011 2018-11-23 21:17:23 Big oil & climate change is a replay of big tobacco & lung cancer only this time, it's our entire habitat that's getting the cancer.

5012 2018-11-23 21:17:22 Obviously I don't mean the Russian people, the oligarchs and those who profit alongside big oil with the initiative. The Russians being far north have the most to gain with a warmer earth? Who know what they think. But I guarantee they calculate.
5013 2018-11-23 21:17:15 Something lingering, with boiling oil...
5014 2018-11-23 21:17:14 Why on earth would a country will so much oil want nuclear power? 
5015 2018-11-23 21:16:59 The Oil Industry paid a bunch of money to prop up a liar that denies and distorts reality, ignores science and evidence, and now are left to regret their choice because he is ruining their business?

I'm shocked. They've never done anything like that before.


5016 2018-11-23 21:16:58 i need sum dab oil im so mf excited to use it

5019 2018-11-23 21:16:19 Pipe scrape hash oil would help. 
5020 2018-11-23 21:16:19 I had a dream where I dropped my maracuja oil from Tarte and bitchhhh, I dead ass got a heart attack in real life.
5021 2018-11-23 21:15:58 You keep saying that & I keep demonstrating that’s not true. And then you repeat yourself.
People leave Alberta because of the celebration if the ‘low class oil trash’ culture-and the resulting difficulty in discussing any problems with oil/gas.
That’s why we left.
Clear enough?
5022 2018-11-23 21:15:52 It should be legal nationwide! I’ve tried the oil for arthritis(not prescription) when visiting Colorado, and WOW, ZERO pain! But it’s not legal in my state.

5025 2018-11-23 21:15:48 @andrewbell Solution for Oil Crisis-pass guaranteed income, shutdown oil production Alta and sask. Buy oil from the humanitarian Saudi's . This way carbon tax is reduced and paying for the guaranteed income is just more debt.
5026 2018-11-23 21:15:33 But Harper gmvt would not allow the same Naguib Sawiris to purchase MTS Allstream; blocked that deal under national security concerns. Also wouldnt allow Chinese interests to buy into the oil sands, nor BHP Billiton to buy Potash Corp...for strategic resource reasons

5030 2018-11-23 21:15:09 I jst want a happy ending massage with plenty oil 
5031 2018-11-23 21:15:07 A petroleum economist once told me that she thought it was mad that we wasted oil in combustion engines - loads of other uses. Oil isn’t bad, we need to change the narrative around its potential usage, imho.
5032 2018-11-23 21:15:07 Shea moisture, Cantu, Carol’s daughter, As I Am, and Crème of Nature Argan oil. It’s plenty more but you just have to see what works best for your hair texture.

5035 2018-11-23 21:14:55 Hey, you know what we should do? See if we can't put even more oil on the market from the tar sands and see what that does to the price
5036 2018-11-23 21:14:48 trump thanks saudis for low oil prices. some experts say stock losses are a result. is this cause & effect, or coincidence? do we thank the saudis for losing money? @danariely @shlomobenartzi @profkeithdevlin @Freakonomics @R_Thaler @Kotlikoff

5040 2018-11-23 21:14:10 I love everything about Lucas Oil Stadium.  So sad that Pro Football Players cannot stand and respect our Flag..So no Pro Games for this guy.
5041 2018-11-23 21:14:08 Erm, because they believe a new oil boom is going to happen...possibly?
I’d say the clue is in the words....just like the word ‘secret’ means no one knows about it, not that it’s been widely reported...I can see a theme developing here!
5042 2018-11-23 21:14:07 Odd you have not condemned the death of hundreds of Mexican journalists and the other reporters who are missing. But being a globalist, you condemn Trump for suspending Acosta's credentials, and then turn around and fill your car full of Saudi oil products!!
5043 2018-11-23 21:14:03 Going live at 3:30. Oil education, Black Friday deals, answering your oil questions. Post questions below.
5044 2018-11-23 21:14:02 These same guys would be complaining about oil prices and shortages if trump sanctioned the Saudis.
Everyone knows once the oil runs out the bomb gets dropped anyways 
5045 2018-11-23 21:13:48 Not sure how a land locked country will get oil to tide water. They will have to negotiate with a foreign country to achieve it. Perhaps two.
5046 2018-11-23 21:13:41 Went to my first oil change today and let me tell you  my father could do that from now on
5047 2018-11-23 21:13:30 Counter suits against big oil should be initiated, if it is shown they strove to alter energy policy against the interests of the American public, they should be held accountable, like big tobacco and their denial....
5048 2018-11-23 21:13:28 Have I told you I make the damn best fresh green beans? Roasted sliver almonds, olive oil, butter, fresh garlic & fresh green beans, all sautéed to goodness!
5049 2018-11-23 21:13:24 So the miniscule emission decrease from not importing as much oil product, despite no plans to refine it here, is a better investment then the scientific consensus advice of moving to renewable energy sources?
5050 2018-11-23 21:13:22 I've delayed getting an oil change for a podcast starter pack" renraku release?
5051 2018-11-23 21:13:17 I'm pretty sure he never quoted any of the figures I've given. Would've been remarkable if he did. Do you have any projections showing gas and oil production will increase?
5052 2018-11-23 21:13:09 Recipe? Um. Dutch oven: brown cubed beef in a little olive oil, add chunks of onion and minced garlic, stir until aromatic, add red wine and other chopped veggies, a little water/stock/bouillon. Stick in a 350 oven for 90 minutes. I like carrots, celery, shrooms. Ymmv.

5054 2018-11-23 21:13:04 Better go get your oil checked
5055 2018-11-23 21:13:04 Lol. It’s actually not a good position for Nigeria. 
So we export crude oil yeah which is our major forex earner. With lower prices, we earn less forex. Dollar price goes up. This in turn affects the price at which the oil products are imported.
5056 2018-11-23 21:12:58 Sometimes I wonder George b'y. With all the oil that's been taken out of the grand banks, and NL is still in dire straits. Makes me wonder.  The jobs are good. But it seems like the oil industry will never be the answer to our debt problem here.
5057 2018-11-23 21:12:56 Not an expert but Lush products saved me. The ‘Dark Angels’ to exfoliate & deep cleanse. ‘Angels on bare skin’ to even out your skin and brighten it. Then a Superdrug tea tree oil infused toner. I also recommend a spin brush for washing your face, however many times you wish.
5058 2018-11-23 21:12:46 Your the greatest keeping our lo info lefties buying our spin. Us elite Libs are making big$$ sending oil by rail selling it back to Canadians at world prices. We are spending more on debt interest than healthcare amd they will vote us back in. #sunnyways

5060 2018-11-23 21:12:41 There are those on Twitter defending the president who think we need Saudi Arabia more than they need us. In an era that is about to get as far from oil dependency as humans have been for over a century, and in which the US has significant resources of its own, that's plain crazy

5063 2018-11-23 21:12:17 I still believe the innovative people, gas, oil, hydroelectricity, farming, tourism, fishing, finance and food (drink....whisky) would allow Scotland to be a viable nation, though given economic fluctuations sometimes borrowing and often paying off debts.
5064 2018-11-23 21:12:03 Saudi oil?

5066 2018-11-23 21:11:32 No more oil! That Ian Wood? The Ian Wood who is one of the millionaire fishing family. The fishing family who Scottish Tories are fighting for and who Mundell said he would resign over? That Ian Wood? #DissolveThe1707Union

5068 2018-11-23 21:11:25 I want a CBD oil pen for Christmas.
5069 2018-11-23 21:11:12 Have you tried CBD oil?

5072 2018-11-23 21:11:01 America: "you're right!" sanctions Iran and Soviet Russia

Big oil: "Yes"

5073 2018-11-23 21:10:49 I'd say more accurately:  The oil patch never seems to learn.
5074 2018-11-23 21:10:43 All that oil and yet Shetland has seen the sharpest rise in foodbank use in Scotland 
5075 2018-11-23 21:10:40 Yes, body oil. It’s a long and lonely weekend.
5076 2018-11-23 21:10:37 Toast is a fine delivery mechanism for guacamole (not as good as fresh tortillas, better than Tostitos), but the fat isn't absorbed by the bread as butter or olive oil would be so it's not really an enhancement for good bread.
5077 2018-11-23 21:10:30 @SenateBeauplan @USEmbassyHaiti this Senator right now is your soil, he called for a terrorist action which is"put oil on the streets" for political reason. He should have held accountable while he is im the US.
A democratic state want peaceful protest.
5078 2018-11-23 21:10:25 Wondering what ppl think the silver bullet is and that he didn’t do. Especially personally. Unless ppl think he singlehandedly organizes BC  recalcitrance on pipelines and cld tell the S Court to go to hell. 
AB upped the production of lower priced heavy oil. He did that too‽

5084 2018-11-23 21:09:58 Just put oil & transmission fluid in my car and some girl held my hood up for me bc it’s broke and two guys rolled up and literally stared at us in disbelief. Girl power at its finest.
5085 2018-11-23 21:09:53 Well, one thing they should definitely NOT do is tie the entire fortunes of the country to oil like the Conservatives did.
5086 2018-11-23 21:09:42 What is it you would have liked them to have done? Bought an oil platform? Nationalise the oil industry? Pay the wages of the people who lost their jobs?

5089 2018-11-23 21:09:36 You are missing the point & confusing consumption with production. Consumption is what needs to be addressed & is not being. In consequence, foreign oil is supplanting Canadian sources causing more emissions & impoverishing all Canadians.

Lower oil from these gates will wipe out the US oil industry
And yet we all love him
5099 2018-11-23 21:09:07 Warren vs carmel for the chip at Lucas oil!! We in that hoe
5100 2018-11-23 21:08:48 So if the price of crude hovers around $50, then 65% of current US production remains uneconomic. Lack of oil production should leave us in short supply of GAS. We are also at 5 year lows on gas storage. We could finally start to see a yin/yang relationship between gas-oil.
5101 2018-11-23 21:08:43 That's incorrect. Montreal was a new market via Line 9 - displaced foreign oil for Montreal refineries. Gulf Coast was accessed for first time via Clipper and Keystone barrels. Markets for 1.8 million bpd new production. These were important projects for industry and AB.

5109 2018-11-23 21:08:02 On the topic of oil, the brent price has dipped below $60 a barrel again. Remind me did the zoomers oil economist in chief, salmond, not tell us back in 2014 ,that oil price would be about $130 and we would all be filthy rich. But only if we voted for indy.
5110 2018-11-23 21:07:52 Keeping all oil in the ground from now on is not saying anything else but "keep all oil in the ground from on." That's how English works.
5111 2018-11-23 21:07:51 Cause we was suppose to get oil for your car smh

It utilizes the vitamins, fatty acids, and nutrients found in pure virgin coconut oil and nature’s finest honey to restore highly damaged hair to beautiful curls that bounce back after each application. 
5116 2018-11-23 21:07:26 Peak oil isn't coming any time soon so although I agree we need to diversify using our current energy resources is the perfect way to go about it.  I believe BC built the new LNG terminal for the same reasons.  By the way, won't that increase tanker traffic on the coast?
5117 2018-11-23 21:07:14 lol no, vegetable oil 
5118 2018-11-23 21:07:11 Was wondering when someone would notice that. Meanwhile Canada moves to sell oil .. elsewhere.

5124 2018-11-23 21:06:47 Anybody ever think that the left ordered the killing of khashoggi in order to pin it on Trump? Hmm also everybody saying oil money is more important than us? We are trillions in debt we need every penny in order to pull out of it , cutting wasteful spending is crucial .

5137 2018-11-23 21:05:11 some oil in the us was going for 30 a barrel when wti was up in the 70s.
5138 2018-11-23 21:05:10 Negotiated with the country that supplies only 11% of the oil to the US and at the price of the life of a journalist.  WTF are you bragging about?  Are you really that obtuse????
5139 2018-11-23 21:05:07 Ah great pic! Love it :) make sure the oil is nice and hot when you fry the livers 
5140 2018-11-23 21:05:02 That's true - but in clinging to an obsession about oil we also lose other opportunities. & the inability to put indy in a global planetary geopolitical contact is embarrasing
5141 2018-11-23 21:04:59 American oil barons obviously didn't pay trump enough.
5142 2018-11-23 21:04:51 So everybody else in America decided to get their oil change today too huh 
5143 2018-11-23 21:04:44 Yanks. Communism is a cancer there's no doubt. What about your government? Having a torture centre in Guantanamo why you don't give back to the Cubans what is theirs. How about your government doing war just to keep the oil of those countries? What about operation condor?

5148 2018-11-23 21:04:08 Corporations want us to think oil & coal aren’t causing climate change, so they argue that 99% of scientists are either liars or stupid.

If they were right, we’d have to reject everything else scientists today hold true. For a start: heart disease, chemo, radar, gravity, & air.
5149 2018-11-23 21:04:01 by expelling illegals, reducing drastically working permits for migrants, imposing tariffs on imports, reducing Iran's export of oil, he has done all he could so prices and wages go up. And what happens when wages and prices go up????
5150 2018-11-23 21:03:51 Oops. Wrong button. 

6 weeks ago I paid $2.78/g for #2 heating oil in Maine.
5151 2018-11-23 21:03:49 Yes those essential oils are not to take lightly....I put way to much oil and conditioner  in my hair daily infused with tea tree for them to stand a chance.
5152 2018-11-23 21:03:47 We put a pre-measured amount of oil (from a dropper) into a tsp. of pudding. She's now suspicious of the pudding, because it doesn't mask the icky flavor, but she's still trusting us. 
5153 2018-11-23 21:03:43 How does a 20 minute oil change take over an hour :(((
5154 2018-11-23 21:03:39 True, but Three Mile Island is in Pennsylvania. In Canada, where I live, it is really hard to live without oil or gas. This country is large and cold.

5157 2018-11-23 21:03:32 Our gasoline prices are tied to the international price of oil, yet it is sold to US at 45% of the world price.  I have a hard time reconciling being an oil rich country that gives away our oil so that we can pay the world price.  Almost like Ontario's excess electricity glut.
5158 2018-11-23 21:03:14 But you will support the reverse of Jacindas ban on gas and oil right
5159 2018-11-23 21:03:10 I suggest that a huge oil discovery in Scottish waters is a terrible blow for the Indy movement
It will harden the resolve of the U.K to  to keep #Scotland in the union
even at Scotland's expense If that involves dissolving and abolishing Holyrood they will say so be it
5160 2018-11-23 21:02:54 So you're all about blood for oil?

5170 2018-11-23 21:01:34 Denis Healey said that in 1975. 

According to Ian Wood and Better Together there are 11 years of oil left, a think its safe to say that isn't true.
5171 2018-11-23 21:01:30 Since 2015........OK ooo election is around the corner.Abuja politician.

5173 2018-11-23 21:01:03 Are you getting you info from oil & gas corps?
5174 2018-11-23 21:00:59 You said, "There are worst states in the federation". Compare and contrast the internal generated revenue and federal allocations to oil producing states with the non-producing states, you will understand better. Check out the roads in the north, you will hate #NigerDelta.
5175 2018-11-23 21:00:59 Rip the oil economy lmfao

5177 2018-11-23 21:00:48 Olive Oil needs help!
5178 2018-11-23 21:00:39 @Wackotwo When talking w climate deniers, start w basics
Carbon in trees (coal, oil) mfg’d from CO2 in air. 
(Photosynthesis ->sugars ->cellulose)
Trees, coal, oil store Carbon
Burning adds CO2 to air. (Ind Rev)
Higher temps linked to more CO2 in air.
Then let it sink in.
5179 2018-11-23 21:00:27 Scotland will never control oil and currencies. The markets control it. An independent scotland would just be a slave to the markets but you can dream with rose tainted glasses or educate yourself.
5180 2018-11-23 21:00:10 The province of Alberta has been supporting the country with their oil/gas. The US also buys 40% of its oil & gas from Canada. It is beneficial for mankind that we decrease our dependence but let’s not forget that every aspect of our lives depends on it.
5181 2018-11-23 20:59:57 I await with excitement for their ruling: Scotland is not yet ready to be a country but may be once Westminster relieves her of the burden of oil.
5182 2018-11-23 20:59:56 Trump is so stupid that he thinks Mexicans are smuggling Oil of #Olay through the #MigrantCaravan. 

@realDonaldTrump #TrumpIsAMoron #Immigration #Immigrants #migrants #OilOfOlay
5183 2018-11-23 20:59:46 While rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the air can be beneficial for plants, it is also the chief culprit of climate change. The gas, which traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood
5184 2018-11-23 20:59:45 It’s better to not get involved from the beginning so this shit doesn’t start. All the fuckery in the Middle East started because of oil and post ww2 dick sizing. The same countries supposed to fight terrorism today are the ones that caused it.
5185 2018-11-23 20:59:31 We all just want a team that makes the effort to play ball and Stephen Kenny has the approach and vision for that,but everyone just wants a decent, thought out change, we are getting sold the same old snake oil
5186 2018-11-23 20:59:27 Was more pissed off at unionists who didnt/couldnt work out why share prices in oil exploration companies working in scottish waters were going up, not down.
Nothing to see move along look at that lovely flag.
5187 2018-11-23 20:59:25 The worst part is that Trump doesn't understand that gas doesn't come out of the ground. I truly believe that he doesn't know that gas is one of the products produced from refining oil.
5188 2018-11-23 20:59:19 I'm here! An air fryer is perfect if you want to stop using oil, but still have that fried feeling. I highly recommend looking for one that has racks in it because they work so much better than the basket ones. Mine is used almost daily for pretty much anything I can fit in it.
5189 2018-11-23 20:59:08 I just threw 2 kilos of #BlackFriday2018 flyers into recycling-didn't look at it. #CanadaPost is mostly just a mule for commercial pollution - like an oil pipeline leaking into our mail boxes. Carbon tax? Yes. & let's add an advertising (commercial pollution) tax. #BuyNothingDay
5190 2018-11-23 20:59:02 If anyone is interested, the rest of the civilized world is discussing climate change on C-SPAN right now because they’ve chosen having a future on this planet over selling us all out to big oil.
5191 2018-11-23 20:58:57 @VP & his brother Congressman-elect left a 20million$ bill for Hoosiers to clean up haz-waste from their centuries old oil company they bankrupted. These grifting losers can't see anything that doesn't profit them. Rigged Indiana, a sorry state of contaminated water for farmers
5192 2018-11-23 20:58:42 Oh ... crap. Dude, how about a heads up a few days in advance next year.

PS -- Roasted, with a bit of olive oil, sea salt and rosemary.
5193 2018-11-23 20:58:42 Kids these days. When I was a kid I changed my oil uphill both ways. IN THE SNOW.
5194 2018-11-23 20:58:29 I have definitely worked off those extra calories today. My triceps are sore from moving 1 1/4" black iron pipe all day. Not to mention 275gal oil tanks.
5195 2018-11-23 20:58:21 What's the difference between that and the Liberal Party's budgetary promises? Or electoral reform? Or getting our oil to tidewater? Or... Or... Or.. #deficit #Budget2018 #promise #electoralreform #oil #bullshit

-Quebec is designated a “Have Not “ Province
-Quebec gets tens of Billions Equalization from Ottawa
-Quebec blocks Alberta Pipeline uses foreign oil
5197 2018-11-23 20:58:14 Would Sudan be interested in throwing a veneer of legality on its forces said to be protecting oil fields by participating in RPF? Security 4 oil seems an area of confluence btn Juba and Khartoum
5198 2018-11-23 20:58:14 You people can also request he pays the electricity bill as long as he remains a senator. He collects 13.5m as running cost every month
5199 2018-11-23 20:58:09 Mine are scented with Cedar Wood oil 
5200 2018-11-23 20:57:49 @fidelitybankplc our machine at forte oil badore is doing selective payment. Not all cards. Am a customer but its not paying me
5201 2018-11-23 20:57:40 Fuck, @Dial made a bar of soap that’s like Oil of Olay, Caress & Dove which is full of moisturizer and it doesn’t rinse off. The past couple days I’ve been in the shower stressed as fuck because I’m extra slippery.

 DRY MY SKIN OUT, DAMMIT!
5202 2018-11-23 20:57:29 well considering a lot of them don't place orders to buy oil until it's in the pipe headed south, they can cause huge problems if they choose to.  what if they deviate from typical ordering patterns and simply tap the breaks?  they had a reason to do this too...
5203 2018-11-23 20:57:25 Micodosing edibles or oil lets you do away with all the negative effects ann still keep the positive. It's a nice transition from all to nothing and a great way to maintain medicinal use. Easy route is to lightly heat bud in olive oil for 20 min and strain, use in 1ml increments.
5204 2018-11-23 20:57:23 Hmm, I'm sure it was the oil pressure switch that my specialist was reluctant to do.
5205 2018-11-23 20:57:16 If only the caravan controlled the price of oil. We would have never heard of them. Oh wait, the caravan happens every year, but we never heard of it until this year. Hmmm...
5206 2018-11-23 20:57:13 "Old man." Ad hominem; nice.  My degree is used daily, in cases involving drugs, medical devices, oil and gas, electrical engineering, etc. I read 3-5 physics books each year. And, the quantum physics of CO2 absorbing and emitting radiation are not new.
5207 2018-11-23 20:57:10 We've known for some time from older leaks that they were excited for arctic melting for the oil exploration possibilities. But this is the most blatant tie between that and their explicit knowledge of anthropogenic global warming.
5208 2018-11-23 20:56:59 Oil prices up???
5209 2018-11-23 20:56:45 Tunisia proposes creation of quality label for Mediterranean olive oil
Agency Tunis Afrique Press
5210 2018-11-23 20:56:43 But that never happened. 

In my opinion we don’t care if Assad remains in power but Russia gotta go. 

Russia wants 150 oil needs 150 oil. like I said yesterday expect some escalation to push up oil prices.
5211 2018-11-23 20:56:41 West Cork Bread Oil. Sandalwood goodness!! Handmade whest along
5212 2018-11-23 20:56:27 As if the value of oil declines in tandem with CNY. That junk currency is far less essential than oil as an essential commodity (sorry greenies, yes we need it).
5213 2018-11-23 20:56:22 Slim Pickens riding the nuke out of the plane in Dr. Strangelove except it's a barrel of oil dot gif
5214 2018-11-23 20:56:20 My neighbor would like his well to start pumping again. Obama expanded our reliance on the US for our oil and Trump will do anything to kill anything he accomplished
5215 2018-11-23 20:56:00 Thanks, but I would rather pay higher gas prices than have artificially low oil prices that tank the stock market. People have lost a lot more in their 401K's than they saved with the lower gas prices. Not a good trade!
5216 2018-11-23 20:55:56 Sheesh, comrade, you can't even recognize when you contradict yourself, can you? "They can't find enough workers in the oil patch. If we sanction SA, we'll lose contracts and some people MAY need to look for jobs." Now, by YOUR OWN LOGIC, where do you think they could find some?
5217 2018-11-23 20:55:51 It would be a tossup who made the most amusing 'there is no oil in #ClairRidge comments, Murdo Fraser of David Leask.
5218 2018-11-23 20:55:48 Mark, after the BP oil disaster, all of our oyster beds were destroyed in Mobile Bay. A huge group of volunteers came from Indiana, stood in the cold January water and helped us rebuild them. I’m forever grateful to your state for that.
5219 2018-11-23 20:55:40 It can only help the fumes if one of your original hoses is split, as we said previously, smell could also be from the oil pressure switch.
The modified pcv kit is to help with preventing sludge build up in the Sump and relieve some of the crank case pressure.
5220 2018-11-23 20:55:33 someone once wanted to use vegetable oil to fuck me like sis calm down spit is cool i guess
5221 2018-11-23 20:55:33 Spent my money on Black Friday when I should’ve used it for an oil change. I think I’m a bad adult 
5222 2018-11-23 20:55:27 Ah but it's shxte oil. Not Norway's golden oil....Our special brand of shxte. No worth a penny.
5223 2018-11-23 20:55:23 Вот хэппенинг? Ай донт ноу. Констант раш. [хелб]
5224 2018-11-23 20:55:23 Midland oil, what kind of daily production volumes?
5225 2018-11-23 20:55:23 Try emu oil. It’s supposed to be great for your skin but has a lovely side effect of growing hair wherever you use it.
5226 2018-11-23 20:55:11 Dahil ba hindi makikinanabang ang mga dalawan sa gagawin oil exploration ng Pilipinas at China  ngawa sila ng ngawa pero yung 20 Bilyong pera galing sa Malampaya nasaan na nilagay kunwari sa DAP.
5227 2018-11-23 20:55:11 Not only he does not knows the difference, he does not cares as long as Saudi oil is cheap. We can control AI, but we can not control climate gone wild. If you go to college or learn more coding, you will not be so afraid of yourself, cause you become AI or AI become you?
5228 2018-11-23 20:55:10 We didn’t used to... but, ya know, hotel properties and oil... 
5229 2018-11-23 20:55:08 Sarso k oil say pairon ki malish kro. Or tasbeeh fatma parho. ShateyA tasbeeh mukammal honay say pehlay In Shaa Allah pur sakoon neend logi.

R u married?? if yes then prag tou nai??
5230 2018-11-23 20:54:53 LOL..Hilarious
His decision to not hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi had nothing to do with oil supply/prices or arm sales, it was ALL about his personal hotel chains and condo sales.

Now watch 45 whine about this judge. Go NY.
5231 2018-11-23 20:54:47 you wanna talk to me it better be on some real shit, idgaf about your homework or some fucking oil
5232 2018-11-23 20:54:45 Ok, but if it’s Exxon’s oil, they’ll still be exploiting it without our help/hindrance, no?
5233 2018-11-23 20:54:44 Governor-elect DeWine sued over the Clean Power Plan- despite Ohio SB 221 putting us in compliance, and saving millions in efficiency alone. The utilities, oil and gas, and ODOT are trying to keep us in high-cost, high-emissions economy.
5234 2018-11-23 20:54:39 Point was about decoupling economy, control to do that (to extent) comes post indie. Honouring terms with oil Cos & anybody else made by UK in Scotland would be the 'prudent' (& legal) thing to do I suspect....renegotiating 'em down the line? That's up to us. Make sense?
5235 2018-11-23 20:54:36 I’m Tellin Ya!!
Sicilian Olive Oil!!! :)
5236 2018-11-23 20:54:35 Ned to tell that to the oil companies
5237 2018-11-23 20:54:30 Smoke and mirrors. Friedman is nothing but a sideshow barker selling snake oil. There will never be a World Series title in Los Angeles with this guy in charge.
5238 2018-11-23 20:54:27 What sort of products use palm oil?
5239 2018-11-23 20:54:27 The fault is not with the oil execs. So easy to blame some distant entity you don’t really know when the fault is closer to home. The fault lies with the those who have to have a huge vehicle for every one in the family. A house the size of a barn and can’t be bothered to recycle
5240 2018-11-23 20:54:21 Man glad I made the most out of this break and went to get my car inspected and the oil changed.
5241 2018-11-23 20:54:08 Been sold by West for comrade Pu, Khashoggi for oil, UK for Russian laundered money
5242 2018-11-23 20:54:08 But Guyanese have oil now tho lol

5244 2018-11-23 20:53:59 Do you always have to twist EVERYTHING- LUKE - into your ridiculous CNY/GOLD/OIL game changer - that will be an inverse game changer?
5245 2018-11-23 20:53:49 二度寝するか迷う
5246 2018-11-23 20:53:06 Probably because you cooked pasta in oil. #aloneathome
5247 2018-11-23 20:53:05 The oil in ur head tho chai
5248 2018-11-23 20:53:04 Why don’t we move the Earth a little further from the sun. So much easier than reducing our carbon footprint or moving about from oil and other fossil fuels! /s haha
5249 2018-11-23 20:53:03 Where are oil prices getting lower??? Where?? Where?? Where??
5250 2018-11-23 20:52:55 They should make a deal, the Americans should agree not to nuke them if they hand over the Crown Prince and all of their oil.
5251 2018-11-23 20:52:54 Naa I’m lost how a 30$ oil change go to a 2k car repair
5252 2018-11-23 20:52:40 He did, it wasn't earmarked for him in his constituency project.
5253 2018-11-23 20:52:36 Their is currently now other cost effective alternative to renewable oil.
5254 2018-11-23 20:52:33 Haba
Boda @alexlobaloba don't be greedy na

Its Santorini oooo
That place when dey white as if human beings no dey go there

At least if we go together we go use palm oil eat yam come drop small for ground then snap am put for Twitter
5255 2018-11-23 20:52:31 Saudi only produces 11% of our oil usage.. Maybe know you can tell the truth about the murder, oh wait you will not, will cost you money
5256 2018-11-23 20:52:27 My first ever purchase in Union Jack Oil was also in 2014 .

 Everything Comes To He Who Waits !!

Good Luck All .

B.T.
5257 2018-11-23 20:52:21 Well I do not like his rhetoric but he has truth in the rudeness. CA guzzles more oil than a small nation. Maybe they should shut down theme parks like Disneyland, farm the old way, insist that all celebrities share their mansions with 5 other families, outlaw private jets
5258 2018-11-23 20:52:19 With restarting our oil wells comes some potential health effects.  Because of this we will be repairing all leaking oil wells that have been damaged in the past 5 years, before we start our oil production.
5259 2018-11-23 20:52:16 When was the last major oil/gas incident in the uk?
5260 2018-11-23 20:52:04 I get better beard oil wey go make your beards full.
5261 2018-11-23 20:51:58 I put a drop of peppermint oil into a water bottle with only 1/3 left, it is STRONG. I don't think I need to add more oil when I fill up the bottle again, it's coated in peppermint on the inside 
5262 2018-11-23 20:51:49 The Democrats HATE LOW OIL PRICES because it means less people will be buying "green renewable technology" crap that depends on HIGH oil prices.
5263 2018-11-23 20:51:45 Well by yr 2100 @realDonaldTrump figures he will be dead by then, he does not give a hoot about our children, does he? As long as Saudi oil is cheap...
5264 2018-11-23 20:51:42 Sorry, but later in year and particularly around #indyref time your story changed. You did an oil gas and coal story “gone in 5 yr.” I recall being at an oil terminal and they found it unbelievable. As did I. And couthy Sir Ian Wood was well aired on BBC - his views well known.
5265 2018-11-23 20:51:33 장판에 몸을 맡겨..
5266 2018-11-23 20:51:32 You assume #UAE is an independent country that wasn't created by British imperialism to serve its interests. This personification of white privilage will be freed very shortly otherwise the Brits will replace the current ruling clan with someother beduoins to manage its oil wells
5267 2018-11-23 20:51:25 Thanks Robyn! Our fantastic web designer Karen burnt the midnight oil and has managed to reinstate most things. Only lost last weeks work - phew! Could have been so much worse. Lesson of the day - back EVERYTHING up!
5268 2018-11-23 20:51:25 Vendo as pataquadas de Genarão Black Oil e seus blue caps da pra entender pq passamos mais de uma década na merda.
5269 2018-11-23 20:51:25 When they die, those plants produce C02.  The rate we are burning fossil fuels is the problem.  Seas and plants cant absolve that much CO2.

Remember, that oil was supposed to be underground, not being burned into the atmosphere
5270 2018-11-23 20:51:24 Then excuse me if you don't understand that.
5271 2018-11-23 20:51:15 Would it make me a 'Trumpist' to point out that some of David Leask's past comments about a "secret oil field" look rather amusing in retrospect?  #Trumpism
5272 2018-11-23 20:51:13 Lawyers can represent kana murder. He’s talking nonsense. He’s lost his focus now. He should just turn politician. Lawyers and politicians bhande nebhurugwa. Christianity and politics is like oil and water.
5273 2018-11-23 20:50:51 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.
5274 2018-11-23 20:50:51 rescheduled my oil change so i could buy the spyro remaster 
5275 2018-11-23 20:50:44 We will be hosting Canada Energy Exports Oil&Gas Summit in beautiful Vancouver, Canada in March 2019. A conference aimed to bring together people of the oil and gas fields to discuss new innovative ideas and technologies while outlining the safety of oil and gas transportation.
5276 2018-11-23 20:50:44 Jamaican castor oil sis!
5277 2018-11-23 20:50:40 Russia sells oil
5278 2018-11-23 20:50:21 See where oil goes in a yr , more Important for you 2020 If it's low<50 you lose TX .If it spikes because you destroyed the US Energy Ind you lose TX.The results of your misguided energy beliefs will someday result in an oil spike that will be Yuge. Nice work .
5279 2018-11-23 20:50:20 Good morning South Sudan. I’ve received news that @Plaid_SAfrica  will be investing $1B in our countries oil sector.  This is a great opportunity for both of us.

Your fresh produce selling at wholesale fees,
The shiny products of your factory floor.
Send these, the cheap goods, gift-wrapped to me,

5281 2018-11-23 20:50:09 I check everything for palm oil now....and i won't buy it,,,this is one of the saddest pictures i've seen for a while.
5282 2018-11-23 20:49:59 Who's FG yasir? Guy please no make me vex see this guy you claim you're supporting is the problem, mind you he's the GCFR

Copper -1.3% to 2.76 lb  $CU
5285 2018-11-23 20:49:41 Imagine bn proved to be Foolish and you're still proving foolish by continuous act of foolishness such guts is unmatched.
5286 2018-11-23 20:49:41 Coconut oil everywhere 
5287 2018-11-23 20:49:32 And while you are at it. You probably should do a meeting with everybody and the managers as well to put in place some kind of security protocol to follow for emergencies. You all ran around like headless chicken until greek gambled and threw water on a fucking oil fire lol
5288 2018-11-23 20:49:28 I hate getting oil changes real talk... something else always has to be found.
5289 2018-11-23 20:49:27 I don’t think it’s a guaranteed loss at all. Go Oil go!
5290 2018-11-23 20:49:20 Hey Buzz How did UK get it’s wealth?  Was it not through illegal wars invasion of sovereign countries stealing oil & gas not forgetting gold diamond etc UK is money laundering capital of the world It’s dirty money keeping bankrupt UK alive U need EU more than EU needs UK Wazzock
5291 2018-11-23 20:49:20 sorry ! Was it busy today, I thought it was only my car dealership that was busy for service today , I been waiting forever for oil change
5292 2018-11-23 20:49:18 Donated is the wrong word there unless he bought it with his personal money 
5293 2018-11-23 20:49:08 If there were an Oscar 4 political stupidity, @VanessaBerhe would b 1 of z primary contenders. Outsmarted, outplayed & outmanovered by z Eritrean preople & leadership z Eritrean enemies & detractors r wasting their midnight oil in trying 2 stay relevant before z funding dries out

5295 2018-11-23 20:48:56 Crude oil is still more profitable then those oils brought by the Wise Men and all.
5296 2018-11-23 20:48:53 Just how is all the industry to become sustainable if companies like Iceland refuse to by the verified deforestation-free palm oil available on the market? Growers are only going to invest in sustainability if their oil is bought, not banned.
5297 2018-11-23 20:48:45 The oregano oil 100% helps for Lyme. It's no placebo. And not expensive.  But who knows the risk.
5298 2018-11-23 20:48:41 Burning  a sea of oil doesn't create wealth

What creates wealth is converting all that energy into another form of energy

And that takes resources

Which we are running short of
5299 2018-11-23 20:48:40 yeah, was on farrier’s formula ds, switched to california trace plus about a month ago. i think the e3 hemp oil is interesting. not crazy high in omega 6
5300 2018-11-23 20:48:37 The vegetables is full of pesticides, not been washed in salty & hot water remove chemicals. Plus oil is floating in each curry. Very un heathy to eat. 99% people will die early because of unhealthy diet. I would only eat Kichhdi & Dahi. There is no control on pesticides. Crazy
5301 2018-11-23 20:48:36 Those Russians must be good. Somehow they got a dim bulb with a 50 IQ into power, and took us out of competing with their oil.
5302 2018-11-23 20:48:33 Why are the so-called “experts” or the Trudeau liberals not talking about the very strong economic argument for Canada to re-develop our oil refining industry?There’s no better opportunity than now! We’re paying 5x more for Saudi oil!We should be concentrating on our domestic oil
5303 2018-11-23 20:48:22 Im a little dissapointed in those oil stains
5304 2018-11-23 20:48:19 Yet when oil is up the pumps are even higher.
5305 2018-11-23 20:48:19 I never oiled a vestal Sith.
I never hope to oil one.
But just in case they're not a myth,
I'd rather oil than roil one.
5306 2018-11-23 20:48:11 I’ve said all along it ain’t about Iran, it’s about forcing Russia to leave Syria. 

Russia will only create havoc in region if allowed to stay. 

I thought everyone would drive oil down to 10 and make it worth their while to leave or starve them if they don’t.
5307 2018-11-23 20:48:10 1 of the few changes I never adapted to.. just can't accept anything else lol. WE USED TO HAVE THE ICE PALACE AND THE THUNDER DOME NOW WE HAVE OIL AND OJ NOOOOOOO!!
5308 2018-11-23 20:48:10 Schwartzman is CEO & investor in Rosneft Oil.
5309 2018-11-23 20:48:10 Who has Black Friday deals on oil changes lol
5310 2018-11-23 20:48:07 Bigger issue is going to be water it’s going to be the future oil.
5311 2018-11-23 20:48:04 ….but if you think that as part of the independence settlement it would be a requirement to honour deal with Exxon....which I would tend to agree with then 'Exxon own the oil' makes my point. 1st things 1st then lets talk about a strategy going forward
5312 2018-11-23 20:47:54 Any oil in Ukraine
5313 2018-11-23 20:47:54 Oil and Gas profits over all things. That’s what I’ve discovered.
5314 2018-11-23 20:47:48 I seem to recall some amphorae with olive oil being recovered from the Mediterranean, but, if so, I don't recall much more, including the suspected dating of the find.
5315 2018-11-23 20:47:33 and he didn't even issue an apology.  He can't talk about the oil crisis because its over his head.
5316 2018-11-23 20:47:22 It ain't a case of #Justice as Usay. Simply put, it's their turn 2maximumly enjoy state resources for the benefit of "THE REGION" in power. Remember @KagutaMuseveni meeting Ugandans studying Oil & Gas abroad? It was like it's the only region in the country. #TwateraEmundu twafuna
5317 2018-11-23 20:47:13 "As the Head of the House Science Committee, Smith has been criticized for his position on climate change and for receiving funding from oil and gas companies.[2][3][4][5][6][7] He was formerly a contributor to Breitbart News.[8]"

Even Jesus vomits on him
5318 2018-11-23 20:47:08 My gas prices haven’t gone down. My local station says big oil needs to make it’s money! Are you the middle class or big oil? Just asking.
5319 2018-11-23 20:47:06 @realDonaldTrump I work for God ,and Jesus he’s my husband.they will soon stop selling oil to you and buying million dollar buildings.Saudi does not need the USA, the USA needs the world, the other continents feed the next beast of Babylon and you sir are  puppeteer.7th Babylon
5320 2018-11-23 20:47:05 I know you illegally sell oil from Kirkuk, meanwhile your leader, who was supposed to have stepped down after his spectacular failure just visited Baghdad to beg for part of the federal budget even though he attacked the federal govt. I know plenty boss. Educate yourself.
5321 2018-11-23 20:46:44 Good afternoon! Just scheduled oil change, etc for my  tomorrow am. Just chillin out. Need to be working but... I don't wanna 
5322 2018-11-23 20:46:40 Not CNY or USD. Oil price is based on the basic supply and demand economics

1 Crude prices went from a 4 year high to a full-blown bear market 30+% in 6 weeks
2 American shale oil boom
3 Demand fears
4 Fast money in futures market due to QE
5 Stock market mayhem
6 Iran head-fake
5323 2018-11-23 20:46:35 The farm equipment can run off veggie oil too to be fair. Many farmers are growing their own for that very use.
5324 2018-11-23 20:46:33 Is anyone else a bit disappointed with these Sephora Black Friday sales?? The only thing I REALLY wanted sold out super fast! Which was the Bumble ans Bumble Invisible Oil Hair Primer. I am so sad I missed out on that! 
5325 2018-11-23 20:46:32 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
5326 2018-11-23 20:46:08 all not proven.......do not hype CBD oil please.
5327 2018-11-23 20:46:08 Probably another AFC South banner hanging from the rafters at Lucas Oil. F'n lame, hahaha
5328 2018-11-23 20:46:06 Boycott @CadburyUK until they stop using palm oil.
5329 2018-11-23 20:46:02 We can stop revelling in oil and switch investment even before independence.
5330 2018-11-23 20:45:48 Also if we had refined in Alberta may be we could have supplied Eastern Canada and eliminated the need for Saudi Oil? But the great brains in the Tapcal Trust Fund PCs were singularly unable to do the math.
5331 2018-11-23 20:45:43 We also need production on out farm as soon as possible. Can't believe we importing soya and sugar beans for cooking oil. I support backward integration that @Busisa74  at URL is advocating for. Out budget must concentrate on such initiatives
5332 2018-11-23 20:45:29 Holy grail product? Of course it’s @VitaCocoOilUK coconut oil. In my hair and on my face - recovering from a long week. 
5333 2018-11-23 20:45:16 You are telling me when you burn Canadian oil and gas there is a different chemical reaction and maple scent floats into the atmosphere? I'd love to read the scientific study influencing this idea of our oil being less harmful to the climate.
5334 2018-11-23 20:45:16 Remember when you spilt all that oil?
5335 2018-11-23 20:45:11 CBD oil as substitute. Smoking anything in general is terrible for your lungs
5336 2018-11-23 20:45:05 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
5337 2018-11-23 20:44:57 Auto correct, calling
5338 2018-11-23 20:44:55 Let the peace flow like oil in this blessed country led by by a great man
5339 2018-11-23 20:44:46 Bring it on, we've been paying the highest price for gas in this country for a long time. I hope the Saudi's turns it up on bust. The world is glutted with oil and nobody should have to pay a fortune to put gas in their vehicles.
5340 2018-11-23 20:44:44 HEMP / CBD oil
A• Love It..Use 
B. Heard about it
C. What’s that ?
5341 2018-11-23 20:44:43 It's not just biofuel that's the problem with palm oil use.
Will read the article now.

5343 2018-11-23 20:44:41 Donnez moi les vrais ! je me souviens qu’en 2008 le baril était monté à 145€ et le prix du gazole a 1€48 ! Entre temps tous les gouvernements ont augmenté les taxes mais l’année avant l’élection de  Macron le gaz oil était à 1€10 à la pompe ! Faut arrêter le foutage de gueule
5344 2018-11-23 20:44:26 Oil down but diesel £1.58 a litre at the pump 
5345 2018-11-23 20:44:11 Oh no lets run an hide...destroy our way of living out of fear....HOW ABOUT THE GLOBALIST STOP FEAR MONGERING AND USE COAL AN OIL AN GAS TO HELP ELEVATE POOR NATIONS!!!!
5346 2018-11-23 20:44:03 Kgosi is even selling the oil 
5347 2018-11-23 20:43:58 Also, uses palm oil. So you might not test on animals but you destroy habitats. Your ‘answer’ to the other post on this topic was prettty feeble.
5348 2018-11-23 20:43:56 We do indeed,  something like 65% goes on taxes,  very slow to fall at the petrol pump or the heating oil lorry......
5349 2018-11-23 20:43:53 Yeah, it's called skunk oil. It smells so bad that people will keep their distance,  making it easier to control yourself,  lol

5351 2018-11-23 20:43:52 I'm talking claire  ridge was found in 1977,so it's the same amount of oil that they reckon is left in north sea,so not more.
5352 2018-11-23 20:43:51 Think of other areas the government could not anticipate in the last 25 years- the growth of the internet, the energy revolution that expanded our oil and gas resources, the power of the cell phone, etc.
5353 2018-11-23 20:43:51 3-3) Thanks to Trump's trade war and wrong foreign policies. The statement of Trump amid he has ordered Saudi Arabia keeps the price of oil low, is a joke for domestic use.
5354 2018-11-23 20:43:46 Do you know what the one thing I bought during Black Friday that wasn’t online was? That’s right I went and got the oil changed in my car for a discounted price.
5355 2018-11-23 20:43:38 Also we have floating oil platforms in the middle of the oceans that use GPS data from satellites to pin their position to within a couple of centimeters...if this tech didn't exist the platform would stray ripping the oil pipes and causing massive oil spills.
5356 2018-11-23 20:43:22 "Oil is... safe. Coal, too much cleaning! We need to get our energy quick. The less we have to clean it the better!" - my prediction for the next Trumpet.
5357 2018-11-23 20:43:22 No one that accepts oil, coal, or natural gas money should be allowed in office, much less near environmental legislation
5358 2018-11-23 20:43:19 Honey is fine lol, and you adding the oil makes it even better

5361 2018-11-23 20:43:10 Yes, I didn't mean my remarks as refutations of yours, but additions. Perhaps we are equally annoyed with the "oil" extraction metaphor, the big data = surveillance trope, the lazy Neo-Frankfurt School theory of platforms, etc.
5362 2018-11-23 20:43:08 Finally washed my car, got an oil change, and I'm going to re tint my windows what a great day
5363 2018-11-23 20:43:00 its a marcellus well in pennsylvania, US. one of the multiple that cabot oil & gas screwed up...

ok, so what about the fact that there always is an outermost layer? be honest with me, you can never fully control this problem, especially not over longer time frames.
5364 2018-11-23 20:42:59 Next Indy Ref, we have 40 yrs of oil. Your pension is safe. Sure the lairs will have new scare stories by then.
5365 2018-11-23 20:42:56 @andrewhorowitz you can add oil producers to your puking puppies and real estate developers hypothesis
5366 2018-11-23 20:42:45 My papa just left me at the oil change place by myself 
5367 2018-11-23 20:42:35 if you just get the oil, it comes in a dropper that you place under your tongue
5368 2018-11-23 20:42:22 I don't think the refinery is being built in South Africa. Jeff is not clarifying here but I'm sure its South Sudan cause they don't have refineries there. Their own oil is refined in Sudan.
5369 2018-11-23 20:42:18 So why doesn't @OilGasCanada reduce production? This is  our non-renewable resources being sold for peanuts. If the free market isn't giving a fair price, then don't add to the glut and further lower prices. Basic economics. @jkenney @Alberta_UCP Once oil gone, it's gone.
5370 2018-11-23 20:42:17 2-3) The region. As a result the price of oil & gas would skyrocket. We don't face this problem; because Trump has allowed some countries buy oil & gas from Iran. But this plunge in oil price is not a good sign. We are observing some type of global economic downturn or stagnation
5371 2018-11-23 20:42:15 Some day when the CPC is in power, you'll be able to do something about it? Just a sec, someone's whispering something in my ear. Oh, they DID have power...for about 10 years, just before this Liberal government, and they bet it all on selling more and more AB oil to the USA?
5372 2018-11-23 20:42:11 This is so unfair. It's like sending Olive Oil into the ring against Anthony Joshua
5373 2018-11-23 20:42:10 OOO THANK You !! I love using it it’s much less hassle than oil paints and still has a nice texture 
5374 2018-11-23 20:42:10 Is he on California Trace? I forget what hoof supplement he’s on. You could also try Elite Three, I’m doing the hemp hulls right now but may try the oil (instead of Dac oil)
5375 2018-11-23 20:42:03 So you and MBS are manipulating the oil prices?   So how much money are you, your family and your backers going to make from this?
5376 2018-11-23 20:42:01 A $45 oil change always ends up costing $200 somehow.
5377 2018-11-23 20:41:59 Goes back to the late 1970s. UK let anybody in to rip the Oil revenues away. Norway didn’t . Simples.
5378 2018-11-23 20:41:55 My aunt always be getting into my shit like my cosmetics and skin stuff. So Wednesday her eyes were dumb irritated like a rash type shit. She then later confessed to me that she got into something of mine that was on the bathroom. She was like I used that rose oil and I think—
5379 2018-11-23 20:41:54 I DO realize you have no clue what you're talking about. Canada produces 3.2m barrels per day and Saudi produces 11m barrels per day. Canadian oil imported into the US doesn't affect world oil prices. Get a clue!

5383 2018-11-23 20:41:36 Sure, I could change my own oil. But how else would I get to watch Jerry springer and drink shitty coffee for 45 minutes?

5386 2018-11-23 20:41:30 Well the cbd oil could help then im pretty sure about it :) worth a try maybe ?
5387 2018-11-23 20:41:22 Psssst—-no such thing as fossil fuel. Were that the case, all ancient cemeteries would not have bones crumbling to dust but instead would be oil wells.
5388 2018-11-23 20:41:21 It’s all about the money. Big oil runs the republicans party.
5389 2018-11-23 20:41:16 You say that but I saw you buying a 10 pack of brass hand oil with 40% off at Argos this afternoon.
5390 2018-11-23 20:41:10 It is usually wheat flour, palm oil, rice vinegar and chop and other chemical preservatives.

5394 2018-11-23 20:40:34 The USA is over producing to lower Fracked Gas production costs, the Saudi's won't cut supply as it allows Iran into the market.......it also means Venezuela and Nigerian oil becomes viable again.........so this won't last for long......

5403 2018-11-23 20:40:01 Thats the greed of europes oil companies. America is paying more then its fair share.
5404 2018-11-23 20:39:48 I read your tweet too fast!  

I don’t have manuka HONEY I have the oil. I just used regular raw honey & added a few drops of the oil (plus the other ingredients)
5405 2018-11-23 20:39:47 This is what #OPEC needs now ... previous try shale oil proved to survive, but this time could be di...?
5406 2018-11-23 20:39:45 We have Gold, Oil, diamond, cocoa, iron, and all natural resources but everybody is BROKE except politicians and pastors.
5407 2018-11-23 20:39:37 Stop it...she was governor for what..18 months ? And the only reason she was popular was that oil prices were through the roof and residents of Alaska have a profit share for oil. As for Obama, are we gonna start tallying qualifications and who did what ? Bush= great recession.
5408 2018-11-23 20:39:36 If oil prices don’t firm soon, the shale industry will collapse.
5409 2018-11-23 20:39:36 You say " caring " ?
5410 2018-11-23 20:39:30 1) Do you think corporate execs and boards have you and your family’s wellbeing at the center of their decision making? Then stop supporting politicians who hold this philosophy as a core principle. Big Tobacco, big oil, big pharma, big agriculture all aim to extract $ from us.
5411 2018-11-23 20:39:24 $43 for an oil change is glorious considering my Jetta cost me $100+ every time  #ILoveMyElantra
5412 2018-11-23 20:39:16 Wow ur right? What the hell?
Big oil is running scared of the Trump train! All our other presidents looked the other way when gas prices increased before and during every holiday!
5413 2018-11-23 20:39:13 I would ask you to show me the republican but literally all of them are for everything just short of eating coal and drinking oil
5414 2018-11-23 20:39:06 Anyone paying attention to some of the key indicators of a weakening economy? Crashing stock market, crypto is hitting all time lows, oil is down and gold is down. I am a bit concerned
5415 2018-11-23 20:39:05 @bpjasperave M Lucic scores first. Go Oil!!!!
5416 2018-11-23 20:39:02 The first oil was found in 1975. And yes modern technology has helped.
5417 2018-11-23 20:38:49 Global Cooling makes it harder to advocate for a transfer of wealth so little chance they’ll go there.  Although they might find a narrative requiring us to give our oil and gas away.
5418 2018-11-23 20:38:49 The markets don’t have to be efficient.  $aapl near $300b market cap higher Oct 1.  Same as Saudis were making $250m more per day selling oil a month ago.  Or $nvda lost $88b or half it’s market cap.  Pundits justify at highs and lows
5419 2018-11-23 20:38:46 Has anyone ever had a level kitchen and stove combo? The oil always runs to one side of the pan and it bums me out.
5420 2018-11-23 20:38:37 Altair
5421 2018-11-23 20:38:35 Considering you get most your oil from Canada... But what ever helps the cause...
5422 2018-11-23 20:38:31 B.....
5423 2018-11-23 20:38:30 The major source of socialism in the US is highways insurance of all kinds, govt subsidies to corporations-especially big oil, reduced payroll taxes for the wealthy, they pay 1/4 to 1/100th of what the lowest wage earners pay!  Then there’s  unearned capital gains!
5424 2018-11-23 20:38:30 Dear @fuzztownshend @ClassicOils   I am tomorrow collecting a rebuilt B-Series engine for my ZB from Bicester. What is your oil recommendation for a newly built engine and moving forward ?
5425 2018-11-23 20:38:18 Destroy the economy and send oil prices high and relations with a ally.  %1000 stupid to retaliate against them for this.
5426 2018-11-23 20:38:05 What if instead we prosecute the heads of oil and auto companies, seize their assets, and use the money to fund programs to fight global warming?
5427 2018-11-23 20:38:02 Water and oil dont mix.
5428 2018-11-23 20:37:58 I know the B by the way...
5429 2018-11-23 20:37:55 I am disgusted by @JustinTrudeau and his cronies allowing the situation in AB to get to the point it has- Canada is an oil based economy like it or not and without AB we are effed!
5430 2018-11-23 20:37:52 Clare field story today made me wonder; was ANYTHING Better Together said during Indyref not a total LIE?
-oil running out
-lose pensions
-equal partners/Vow
-federalism
-can't use £
-guarantee place in EU
-Spain veto
-build frigates on Clyde

Did I miss anything out?
5431 2018-11-23 20:37:49 Respect yourself King. Men aren’t suppose to check ’s. Only thing you should be checking is the oil, washer fluid, transmission fluid, brakes, tires, & the gas gauge
5432 2018-11-23 20:37:48 Lack of petroleum rev tax charged by UK Gov maximises profits for oil cos then UK Gov gets corporation tax from overall profits. Avoids going into GERS.
5433 2018-11-23 20:37:46 With respect!Any person with a bit of commonsense would know this is exactly what Trump wants! 
He has them exactly where he wants them
I have no doubt the Conversation was something like!“I’ll play&show the World I am sticking by you, but Oil Prices must come down immediately”
5434 2018-11-23 20:37:38 I'm glad you are trying to be better educated!  Oil and coal would normally stay underground and their CO2 gas would not get released.  When oil and coal are burned, their CO2 is released. Natural processes don't release anywhere near the amount of C02 compared with coal and oil.
5435 2018-11-23 20:37:38 @JedediahBila what was the face oil you mentioned on the Five yesterday?  I need help!
5436 2018-11-23 20:37:34 How long before I get the dangerous idea to learn oil painting?
5437 2018-11-23 20:37:25 Fuck oil is just getting smashed off 7% o/night

Premium unleaded was $1.64 here in Noosa on Wed

Should go down to $1.62 now
5438 2018-11-23 20:37:17 I know it’s steady there, and it’s primarily for gas that has lots of other valuable liquids stripped from it. Oil drilling... not so much. Oil field areas are dead. Ft Mac has no large projects on the boards.

5445 2018-11-23 20:36:30 very, very lazy (but healthy) dinner tonight - made soup from pre-cooked beetroot blitzed with garlic, thyme, veg stock and a little olive oil and served it with low-fat creme fraiche mixed with horseradish cream (because horseradish and beetroot are *yummmm*!)
5446 2018-11-23 20:36:29 No oil or butter ... wot
5447 2018-11-23 20:36:29 We heat with wood and pellets, very warm and much cheaper than oil.  We have a huge supply of trees, so no problem there either.  We keep looking at windmills, might make it all electric....
5448 2018-11-23 20:36:18 Oga, all this grammar will still come up if he initially said the same thing about Atiku and then turned around to endorse him.

I am not a political troll and I hold no allegiance to any political party, therefore I'm unbiased. I say things as they are.

5451 2018-11-23 20:36:09 about to join the church of sweet almond oil
5452 2018-11-23 20:35:58 This diplomatic protest is a good move. I'm with you on this matter. And I expect you to object on the   joint gas and oil exploration. The first paragraph on the MOU which must have been prepared by China states that we recall our complaint from the UNCLOS. That's unacceptable.
5453 2018-11-23 20:35:57 Blow your load early, hmm? Lets be honest here, you would discount anything I provided. Your name indicates either you know very little about beto, or dont care he is the 2nd largest recipient of oil & gas lobbyist money.
5454 2018-11-23 20:35:41 What an incredible feeling to be able to watch the Western Boone football team win state in person at Lucas Oil  WEBO PROUD 
5455 2018-11-23 20:35:19 @JustinTrudeau 
Good time to hike oil prices in the interest of National security concerns. Hold off on Trans Mountain for reserves.
5456 2018-11-23 20:35:16 Nothing to do with demand /supply. Pure speculation. Ppl were predicting 100 when it crossed 70, now predicting 40 on decline. Now shale oil investment will stop, this itself will stabilise crude.

5462 2018-11-23 20:34:26 @Esso_GB oil prices at all-time low. Any chance of dropping your extortionate prices? #daylightrobbery
5463 2018-11-23 20:34:16 Trump doesn’t care about Khashoggi at all. It’s about oil and military dominance in Saudi and Middle East. He will keep bending over, over and over again
5464 2018-11-23 20:34:14 お目覚め！
5465 2018-11-23 20:34:03 Canada is your largest oil supplyer...44%.
5466 2018-11-23 20:33:57 The ludicrous part is that we will come up with a million solutions all while avoiding the obvious one which is "stop drilling for oil." Sure, we should explore solutions for the damage that's already done, but we're still pumping more CO2 into the atmosphere.
5467 2018-11-23 20:33:55 If crude trades below $50 a barrel I think only Saudi & may be Russia will afford to sale at that price. Even US shale companies are not afford because extracting  oil & gas from shale via fracking is extremely capital intensive & would not be feasible to sale below $ 50 a barrel
5468 2018-11-23 20:33:55 Yu Actually Not Suppose To Run Yo Car Like. It Fukks Up The Engine In Due Time & Oil Level
5469 2018-11-23 20:33:51 move south.
5470 2018-11-23 20:33:51 Confirmado mesmo que foi fake essa história de Black Oil?.
5471 2018-11-23 20:33:48 @BP_plc oil prices at an all-time low. Any chance of dropping your extortionate prices? #daylightrobbery
5472 2018-11-23 20:33:29 Any good primers on the economics of the interplay between OPEC and other major oil producers re: production levels and price-fixing
5473 2018-11-23 20:33:28 It isn't about arm sales or oil. It's about lining his pockets.
5474 2018-11-23 20:33:19 You should be in jail you snake oil salesman
5475 2018-11-23 20:33:07 Bravo.....
Oil may bamboo bhigo bhiggo k iski khaatir madaraat karo..

5478 2018-11-23 20:32:36 U.S isn’t dependent on Saudis for energy, & Saudis have nothing but oil to sell, so their cutting production will hurt them more than it will us. Someday we’ll find out why Trump is literally letting them get away with murder, but it’s not about oil.
5479 2018-11-23 20:32:33 The US already buys Canadian Oil below market value.  Discounted Saudi oil

5481 2018-11-23 20:32:26 $70 for a damn oil change 
5482 2018-11-23 20:32:25 Congress' new climate change report is warning of huge dire consequences costing US economy hundreds of billions, while DT does worse than nothing, a modern day Nero.  The ostrich thinks saving a few bucks now 4 Big Oil is heroic.  He's abdicated his sacred duty to America.
5483 2018-11-23 20:32:14 The ad doesn't claim that ALL PO is 'dirty'; how many thousands of o-tans have been lost as habitat in say Sumatra has been replaced by oil palms; how many hunted out in patches isolated by palm oil? Must be thousands? I don't support a boycott but this is a massive over-reaction
5484 2018-11-23 20:32:12 Who cares? We’re not willing to lose an ally, oil producer, and US goods buyer  bc they offed one of their own. Other countries do similar things and US hasn’t done anything. #DrainTheDeepState only want to see @realDonaldTrump fail. Larger fish to fry. #MAGA
5485 2018-11-23 20:32:08 Congress' new climate change report is warning of huge dire consequences costing US economy hundreds of billions, while DT does worse than nothing, a modern day Nero.  The ostrich thinks saving a few bucks now 4 Big Oil is heroic.  He's abdicated his sacred duty to America.
5486 2018-11-23 20:32:05 So I’m at Lucas Oil Stadium watching a football game between the Saints and the Bears. Saints are lead by head coach Jason Garrett.

Can’t make this stuff up folks.
5487 2018-11-23 20:31:58 What about Alberta's oil crisis Andrew! Are you aware that the economy, and many jobs across the country, are in jeopardy? We have heard very little from you on this pressing dilemma. Please step forward, or get somebody else to do so!
5488 2018-11-23 20:31:55 Pssst. We contribute nothing to Crossrail but do receive 100% Barnett consequentials on the spend, and London sewer upgrade is not taxpayer funded.  All oil revenues are shown in Scottish government accounts.
5489 2018-11-23 20:31:50 Feels like final frontier at present.
world is on verge of revelation ,13.
Fukushima will cause black death in Ocean near great barrier Reef, not oil carriers as banter has it.
This is on its way, already there are signs in the sky of paranormal origin.
Higher intelligence is now
5490 2018-11-23 20:31:46 Because very little (or none) of the dialogue I come across allows for this point - in fact most revel in oil and reject any problem at all
5491 2018-11-23 20:31:44 @lampidicsparrow Where does this oil stop falling ??
5492 2018-11-23 20:31:42 #XRP will be the oil in the future global economic machine
5493 2018-11-23 20:31:37 Congress' new climate change report is warning of huge dire consequences costing US economy hundreds of billions, while DT does worse than nothing, a modern day Nero.  The ostrich thinks saving a few bucks now 4 Big Oil is heroic.  He's abdicated his sacred duty to America.
5494 2018-11-23 20:31:36 If all cars went electric, how much of the world's oil supply would we no longer need? How many lives would be saved not fighting over middle east oil?
5495 2018-11-23 20:31:28 The oil was discovered in 1977,so not more oil,just the same amount, but now they've the technology to extract it.
5496 2018-11-23 20:31:24 Nick and I agreeing on a house and a price is like oil and water.
5497 2018-11-23 20:31:20 Only via an oil embargo of Saudi oil.  Outside of that singular item, there is little need or value to the other type of aid to KSA
5498 2018-11-23 20:31:09 Use a higher dose of cbd oil twice daily. This will help you wean off without feeling like a dumbass. I take breaks on and off, but this bear market has me blazing everyday!
5499 2018-11-23 20:31:00 You’re brutal
5500 2018-11-23 20:31:00 William dalrymple - the return of the King

Oil on water - helon habila 

A certain amount of madness : the life,politics and legacies of Thomas sankara.
5501 2018-11-23 20:30:56 Stop lying.  Nothing you do affects oil prices aside from an occasional blip.  Oil is a commodity.  The U.S. is a free market economy.  You have no power over supply or demand.  The free market determines how much producers supply, not you.  Not any president.
5502 2018-11-23 20:30:49 I searched out some this week and found companies like Sainsburys and M&S have statements on their websites about the provenance of their palm oil, if it helps 
5503 2018-11-23 20:30:47 Premier league is dead anyway . Sold it's soul to oil barons that's was most of Europe think of this league. Even with some clubs doing well there's only one club that makes all the headlines that's @ManUtd there's fuck all else about England #mufc FACT @premierleague
5504 2018-11-23 20:30:46 so is oil money, and oil is demonstrably destructive to the environment.  Deepwater Horizon incident is still wrecking fishing industry in Louisiana and florida.  what damage could a dirty solar panel do to local economy?
5505 2018-11-23 20:30:46 Water isn’t wet because being “wet” means being saturated with a liquid, and since water can not be saturated with itself, it’s not wet. If you put oil on it though, then the water would be saturated with a liquid and would be wet.
5506 2018-11-23 20:30:45 You should check out the leveraged oil ETF’s
Could be just the ticket you’re missing.
5507 2018-11-23 20:30:43 Ok now that I know lash extensions are hella expensive I need to start using that castor oil my mom got a decade ago
5508 2018-11-23 20:30:42 Wonder what it'd be like if they had a black Friday oil sale in the middle east...

5510 2018-11-23 20:30:38 Maybe a deep conditioner or hot oil treatment 
5511 2018-11-23 20:30:37 Add truffle oil to your frozen pizza for a jazzy sensation
5512 2018-11-23 20:30:26 Instructions:

2. Stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt in large bowl. 
3. Add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla; beat on medium speed of mixer 2 minutes.

5513 2018-11-23 20:30:22 @VinnieTortorich have you ever heard of something called Sacha Inchi Oil for intake of Omegas? Just wondering.
5514 2018-11-23 20:30:20 Naw,,, I’d be glad to rub a lil’ more oil on you, ANYTIME OF THE DAY OR NITE!!! 
5515 2018-11-23 20:30:16 Vegans use coconut oil instead of butter and call shit vegan. It’s just mashed potatoes bro, you’re not fancy
5516 2018-11-23 20:30:12 I guess President Nixon should have caved to Arab petro-states in exchange for cheap oil during the 1973 oil crisis.
5517 2018-11-23 20:30:08 Ian wood , who told Scotland to vote no the oil would run out Ian wood who has shares in fracking co's stitched up big time
5518 2018-11-23 20:30:04 Have you tried coconut oil, I know it’s very oily but apparently it’s good for repairing your skin, has gotten rid of rashes on me before x
5519 2018-11-23 20:29:47 Trump:If I let you kill another journalist can we get oil down to $30 a barrel?
5520 2018-11-23 20:29:46 Iceland 'all', not just the segment that supplies Europe. Some of Jonathon's assertions in his tweet string here just don't ring true to me. Where does the ad say that tens of thousands of o-utans have been killed by oil palm plantations (and it must be thousands indirectly?)
5521 2018-11-23 20:29:32 I get sovereignty. de jure & de facto as it 'appens neither of which Scotland has which is my point (1st things 1st ) & I get Exxon.
I also understand that strategy is to do with future planning....but I still don't understand how ' It's Exxon's oil' follows from my point?
5522 2018-11-23 20:29:27 The only thing Canada should be doing is cutting off Saudi oil.  Not because of anything they did, but because we have our own.
5523 2018-11-23 20:29:24 I see it differently. BOC will buy to keep yields low. This will protect housing market from rising mortgage rates. A collapse in oil is ok, but not housing in TO or Van. No Liberal votes in AB, nothing to loose there.
5524 2018-11-23 20:29:23 Congress' new climate change report is warning of huge dire consequences costing US economy hundreds of billions of $, while u do worse than nothing, a modern day Nero.  U, the ostrich, think saving a few bucks now 4 Big Oil is heroic.  U've abdicated ur sacred duty to America.

Stencil and colored aquatint, and one lithograph and etching and aquatint and oil on paper
5526 2018-11-23 20:29:13 Now I need a oil change
5527 2018-11-23 20:29:12 Dr @obyezeks is saying education will be the new oil. 

The world is looking at alternatives to this depleting resource, but our Hon Minister @tundefashola says "there is need for the progress to continue. Dubai was built with oil-money, Nigeria can be built with it too."


5528 2018-11-23 20:29:03 I noticed-  this morning that my shower gel supposedly contains essential oils - however there's no 3 in1 oil, WD40 or Duckham's 20/50 so that’s nonsense!
5529 2018-11-23 20:28:59 Ingredients:

Cake:
2 cups granulated sugar
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup oil (vegtable oil)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup hot water
5530 2018-11-23 20:28:51 U.S. stocks closed lower Friday as tech shares fell and crude oil prices tumbled on fears of a global oversupply.
5531 2018-11-23 20:28:32 i get sesame oil for like £2 so
5532 2018-11-23 20:28:23 Oga all this grammar won't come up assuming he endorsed Atiku, moreover go and read the thread he made after the money fr form was announced to be 40m

5534 2018-11-23 20:28:14 That is one sexy oil dispensing setup!
5535 2018-11-23 20:28:14 @FatKidDeals any deals on oil diffusers? Thank you
5536 2018-11-23 20:28:03 Of course my brother
5537 2018-11-23 20:28:01 In honor of #climatefriday, here's a reminder that the oil executives who've known about global warming for decades and spend billions of dollars to protect their ability to keep destroying the planet quite literally put profit above the survival of human civilization
5538 2018-11-23 20:28:00 Just this simple: 
- Living in a Big Oil state, working for FF industry or
- Multi generations of R’s living off trickle down lobbying or weapons contracting
- all know CC real but don’t want 2hear or know ab’t it
- Russian Republican Petrostates, just lefty conspiracy. Right?
5539 2018-11-23 20:28:00 誰と通話してるの？
5540 2018-11-23 20:27:58 Well my routine is:
-Wash no more than once a week
-Rinse daily and apply liberal conditioner 
-towel dry and apply leaves in conditioner. 
- apply curling mouse 
- every other week do an oil or hair mask treatment
- take heavy hair, nails and skin vitamin with biotin
More.....
5541 2018-11-23 20:27:54 This does not answer your question, why can’t they find a sustainable and  suitable alternative to palm oil? Drives me mad these companies are driven by profit and accountants. I’m sorry Nicky I’m now having a rant xxx
5542 2018-11-23 20:27:44 Please stop insulting us, are you trying to say we have the poorest president in the world while we are one the highest oil producing country in the world. Oga even if buhari leaves office today his generation unborn can never be poor. Being a sycophant can't change anything.
5543 2018-11-23 20:27:44 @AderonkeOduko coman buy better black soap and glow oil, so u will look set for Christmas

And not like babcock suya
5544 2018-11-23 20:27:42 Dear America , if you keep voting for the oil,gas and coal financed @GOP then you won’t have an America to vote in. You will be the refugees.
5545 2018-11-23 20:27:39 Want your skin to glow? Masturbate in the shower then after hydrate your skin with lotion n put a double of drops some rosehip oil mix in.
5546 2018-11-23 20:27:39 Cant get in Lucas oil
5547 2018-11-23 20:27:14  I know it hurts to see India reach Mars earlier than China or Japan in Asia, or Indian nuclear SSBN submarines on deterrent patrol, or Indian GSLVs launch heavy satellites for NASA while those swimming in oil can only build gold palaces and mosques.
5548 2018-11-23 20:27:13 Fo sure i mean i dont use cbd oil but i smoke it up lol  i always wanted to suggest you cbd oil but i was too shy and idk everything about ur chronic pain lol
5549 2018-11-23 20:27:13 なんていうか、多分異常としか言えないような狂気的な数字をもって就任した気がするし、いっそ生まれながらのヒュプノ(催眠能力者)で、は彼女の能力を模倣した劣化品……みたいなのは考えるよね
5550 2018-11-23 20:27:11 Those $.50 cent ties and caps he charges $50 a piece for seem to be doing okay. Ivanka's foreign made crap too. Proof he's full of it - Saudi Arabian hierarchy kills an American & he praises their oil production.
5551 2018-11-23 20:27:03 Got long oil and stocks 10/1 and left for Maui!
5552 2018-11-23 20:27:03 Por mim vocês pegaM o Galiotte, o Genaro, o PN, a Leila e a Black Oil e enfiam tudo no cu do Mustafá. 

EU QUERO É O TÍTULO DOMINGO!! 


5553 2018-11-23 20:27:03 We will still need fossil fuels for quite some time. How will we get to work, to the hospital, to our vacation spots, to visit our parents? Yes, let’s invest more in alternative energy sources without question. Big oil players left Alberta already, leaving many without jobs..,
5554 2018-11-23 20:26:51 This is politicians' favourite medium of offering so called favour to the populace, instead of giving this minor minor help, let him raise motion in the Senate chamber concerning monumental unstable power supply in Nigeria.
5555 2018-11-23 20:26:44 I am sure Trump will ask for a price of 20 for oil.
5556 2018-11-23 20:26:34 There is no meltdown you fool. It's the deal that Trump struck with the Saudi's not to stress them over the journalist. Lower oil price or else.
5557 2018-11-23 20:26:20 my grandpa told me he sent my grandma to get her oil changed and she came back with a whole new car 
5558 2018-11-23 20:26:18 only complaint i have with the car is i can’t find Diaqueen motor oil anywhere... can’t change the fluid on my rear dif or transfer case so she’s sitting
5559 2018-11-23 20:26:13 Or buying oil now ?
5560 2018-11-23 20:26:08 Good point; CBD oil is interesting to me, although for now I'll keep everything off the table.
5561 2018-11-23 20:26:04 Part of the dollars kickback dai collected from contractors and sales of shop  qiki dai baba
5562 2018-11-23 20:26:02 Modi spent Tax payer money for his publicity Rs9000cr, Rs 3000cr on Patail Stative.and swallowed Rs 70,000 Lak cr from 2015 to 2017 fron crude oil price fall ,$185 to $35 per barrel. Petrol price never decreased . Now to favor Air lines he will introduce ATF in GST.
5563 2018-11-23 20:25:55 People so excited about the CGI Lion King and I’m being a Debbie downer like well you know everything the sun sets on is already gone due to animal hunters/global warming/oil
5564 2018-11-23 20:25:43 @YourMapleRidge oil spill on the cottonwood hill at 232. Hoping you’ll be cleaning it up soon. Dumped sand isn’t helping. #oilspill #mapleridge
5565 2018-11-23 20:25:36 Lol same old story.  It’s just corruption writ large.  

Oil industry followed the same playbook as the cigarette industry to forestall regulation and sow doubt.
5566 2018-11-23 20:25:33 What about sustainable palm oil that doesn't involve habitat and ecosystem destruction and is more environmentally friendly than many other oils in terms of land use? I think an outright ban on all palm oil gives the wrong message - there's so much potential in clean palm oil
5567 2018-11-23 20:25:29 Yes, of course. People do change. But it's how you "change" that matters.

He has not addressed how he changed. He never came out to say he was wrong back then.

He's only now trying to justify why he changed without substance. He's just being another politician.
5568 2018-11-23 20:25:28 electric car died back on the early nineteen hundreds
 Stanley steamer the last try at steam driven propulsion for motor vehicles.
Suzuki swift can do auckland Wellington on a tank of petrol 
Peak oil was bullshit
Freaking out about the emissions of CO2 is madness on stilts
5569 2018-11-23 20:25:27 Sad. Just like the US. Homelessness in CA resulting in typhus & excrement in the streets. Rich nations of the world keeping the riches at the top. Suspect oil produces another type of pollution. No excuse for this here or over there.
5570 2018-11-23 20:25:16 @cnnbrk @foxandfriends @MSNBC @maddow Is it true that America gets 40% of oil from Canada and 10% from Saudi Arabia?
5571 2018-11-23 20:25:09 ما قصرو معها ابتعثوها وتكفلوا بدراستها وبدل أن تأتي وتساهم في بناء الوطن اتت لتهدمه وتتآمر مع اعداءه 

خلاصة القول لعن الله الدياثة واهلها
5572 2018-11-23 20:25:02 Thanks for a great comeback stream! I am still a bit rusty but tomorrow I’ll apply some oil lol #gaming #youtubegaming #youtubestreamer #streamer
5573 2018-11-23 20:24:55 Well CA liberals scream global warming caused by oil. But 17,000 years ago Scientists say the last Ice Age melted. No cars, no factories, no huge Celebrity mansions, private jets, no huge concerts, no huge multiplex theaters
5574 2018-11-23 20:24:49 This ain't about oil.
5575 2018-11-23 20:24:43 Justine realizes that he created the oil crisis in Canada,
5576 2018-11-23 20:24:32 Well he can afford it. No be beans to collect #13mil monthly.  Is it his responsibility...? But when there is huge and free money to spare why not...The more we look the less we see
5577 2018-11-23 20:24:29 Hey @MSNBC it’s not hard. Why do you ask why? Trump is down on client change because his mistress or compadre, whatever, has little else besides oil, gas, coal, asbestos, and smartass statements to export. Daddy wants, daddy gets. Something tells me you know this already, though.
5578 2018-11-23 20:24:29 @realDonaldTrump How’s the market today you loser?  Got some more snake oil to sell?
5579 2018-11-23 20:24:28 I'm sorry. Lets get rid of the offensive term then...

Canadian oil and gas companies get financial assistance from the fed guv to the tune of $3.3B/yr.

See how the truth is still there?
5580 2018-11-23 20:24:25 A guy next to me at Duke of Oil said, “getting your oil changed is like getting an sti test. You don’t know what they’re going to find so you pray that nothing major is found.”

Yeah, ok...
5581 2018-11-23 20:24:21 It’s really great. No tomato sauce, just buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, olive oil. I added salt though, which was perfect. They call it the Vittoria, so you need to make it happen over there.
5582 2018-11-23 20:24:20 why did you delete all the bullish oil tweets?
5583 2018-11-23 20:24:16 The thing is we can produce all the oil gold copper in the world but convincing brain dead unionists is the problem.
5584 2018-11-23 20:24:07 Oil headlines have been sparse over the past 24-hours, but the broad selloff resumed as markets remain focused on rising production levels globally and fears of a slowdown in global economic growth.
5585 2018-11-23 20:24:04 The Exstinkion Rebellion would be better served disrupting logging in the Amazon or palm oil deforestation in Malaysia.
5586 2018-11-23 20:23:59 @Knorr ... why the palm oil in your stock pots? Do you have a plan for getting rid of that?
5587 2018-11-23 20:23:48 Came for a basic oil change and somehow spent $178 at Valvoline 
5588 2018-11-23 20:23:44 I make a very delicious avocado oil based mayo. Super easy. Super yummy. Virtuous and essentially good!
5589 2018-11-23 20:23:41 Apparently the oil is due to run out the day after indyref2 is announced
5590 2018-11-23 20:23:40 at least 1 day next week there will be a positive bounce, could be some seriously good swing trades - I do not trade oil plays so they are not what I am referring to
5591 2018-11-23 20:23:26 Lots of small changes make big differences though Mol, if everyone stopped using at least one thing that had palm oil in it it’d still make a massive difference. That can only be a good thing. Less demand in turn will mean less production.... xx
5592 2018-11-23 20:23:25 there's literally millions of dollars being funneled from oil and gas companies to politicians explicitly to oppose climate change measures and you're acting like there's some awesome benefit to supporting climate change resolutions that somehow no one can see?
5593 2018-11-23 20:23:17 You’re out of olive oil. Just saying.
5594 2018-11-23 20:23:11 All energies of the federal government, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
5595 2018-11-23 20:23:06 Worth checking the sources of palm oil in the mincemeat - sustainable palm oil (Roundtable Certified) is better than many other oils as it uses less land - but dirty palm oil is the problem (ie. Non certified) as it involves the destruction of habitats and ecosystems...
5596 2018-11-23 20:23:05 BOTH THE PRINCE+TRUMP ONLY REGRET GETTING CAUGHT COLLUDING WITH EACH OTHER 2 MURDER  KHASHOGGI+COVER IT UP FOR AN ARMS DEAL+AN OIL SCAM TO TRY+CONTROL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY WITH-HOLDING OIL+OTHER PRODUCTS 
THE BIG "DEAL" TRUMP MADE WITH THEM "OFF PAPER"!!!
5597 2018-11-23 20:22:53 I'm sorry, but Tidewater absolutely wasn't necessary until US oil production took off.  The us was a massive importer of crude and there was a boatload of other country imports for Alberta oil to displace.  Should we have gotten to Tidewater?  Yes.  And we should now as well.
5598 2018-11-23 20:22:43 Gonna be really hard to have oil rise with falling CNY if oil is priced in both CNY & USD.
5599 2018-11-23 20:22:39 "oil crisis"
Really?
5600 2018-11-23 20:22:38 @POTUS eveyone should be able to speak up. No deals with Saudi until they demonstrate more ethical means of approaching situations. And we dont need oil. More #reneableenergy rebates plz!
5601 2018-11-23 20:22:37 Walked into pep boys for oil change walked out with them talking bout they need 2k from me smh
5602 2018-11-23 20:22:28 #Poll : #Crude crashed today even after #SaudiArabia production news hit the market late in the day. Are #markets asking shale oil for a cut rather than #OPEC? #OOTT
5603 2018-11-23 20:22:26 If anwar was president @realDonaldTrump  happy moment, no 1 could do for 30+ yrs and usa was gonna b an energy leader, then why kiss Saudi prince booty? The prince is guilty, america has oil lets use our own reserves and show we dont accept murders even from allies.
5604 2018-11-23 20:22:24 Report: Trump’s Justice Department Wants To Break Up An International Oil Cartel   ..no to..in če jim rata..bomo tudi mi tle u jebenem Slovenistanu na boljšem.. ampak je vseeno treba predstavljati Trumpa kot neki najhujšega v zgodovini..ane
5605 2018-11-23 20:22:22 So this is my first time doing this quick stop oil change where you stay in the car and why do I even bother with Walmart when they left me sit for 3 HOURS AFTER IT WAS DONE?!?
5606 2018-11-23 20:22:10 To your last statement, are you saying Albertans should be happy about the oil price dropping?  Further, a large portion of our taxes went towards government services as we have one of the most expensive systems. This was a waste in your opinion?
5607 2018-11-23 20:22:05 Roughly chop the cress, then thinly slice the butter in oil in a second pastry sheet at the wine and heat until the butter,
5608 2018-11-23 20:22:02 I use CBD oil capsules 60 count, 15 mg per capsule 900 mg per 60 caps.  I take 2 a day. Plus I use a vape shot 4 times a day 1 mg per shot. I have some serious medical problems & pain  now it is gone. Vets want desperately to try this. @POTUS needs to EO separating Hemp from Pot.
5609 2018-11-23 20:21:57 The mental gymnastics it takes to see fracking, the building of oil pipelines, factory farms and the under-utilisation of renewables and think... Gosh, there's nothing else for it. We're just going to have to float some metal in space!
5610 2018-11-23 20:21:57 Stephen Moore - CNN Senior Economic Analyst: Should #oilprice drop below $50 pb , some smaller US oil operations (Alaska, Texas, North Dakota) may close down as they won’t be viable.

5613 2018-11-23 20:21:51 The Liberals had absolutely no choice. They had to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline to ensure expansion. Crude oil won't be obsolete for many decades. We have to acquire more independence in our markets for crude oil. A completed Trans Mountain will be worth tens of billions.
5614 2018-11-23 20:21:42 If the #oil industry is so lucrative why do the #AB #TArsands keep expecting #Canadian #Taxpayers #citizens to bail them out... if your LOSING 60 - 80 million a day I have an idea ... SHUT IT DOWN IDIOTS #cdnpoli #Refine for domestic consumption QUIT the BOZO SHOW #Transmountain
5615 2018-11-23 20:21:32 Oil prices fall more than 7% due to spike in production. Everybody is trying to produce and sell as much oil as they can. I would not be suprised to see oil fall under $30.
5616 2018-11-23 20:21:31 That is funny lots of provinces do not have oil, but seem to have plenty of jobs. Maybe the Con's when in power for so long should have diversified a little more, especially when they seen the demand for fossil fuel slowing down. All eggs in one basket is always a disaster.

Palm oil must not destroy habitats!
5622 2018-11-23 20:20:48 Why not look at it this way? People change, dynamisms of human, he might hv measured and weighed both to choose the lesser evil.
5623 2018-11-23 20:20:48 I was pouring some coconut oil into a smaller jar (for hair and body use) and then I wanted to close the coconut oil, but I reached for the smaller lid and it dropped into the oil. I fished it out with a spoon. I can't explain how much this "contamination" is bugging me.
5624 2018-11-23 20:20:46 Economic posture and oil policies, true strengthening of NATO, defense posture and approach. All extremely negative Rusia. Give me your best evidence that Trump is acting like a Russian puppet ?
5625 2018-11-23 20:20:44 Wow, it's lovely and well-made !
If I could, I'd request as well !
Though, we can see it's not a real "Oil" color, but it's still cool !
5626 2018-11-23 20:20:42 Growing #Cannabis on top of the #earth #soil for oil as opposed to digging holes in it for crude oil seems to make better sense to me. But I didn’t make it far in school.
5627 2018-11-23 20:20:38 I’m a bit out of the loop here, but I’m hearing talk of a new oil field which will keeps us going for a few decades.....has Mr Harvie and the Greens said much on this?
5628 2018-11-23 20:20:34 Yep. So what if I worked for an oil company because that’s the job where I live but I voted for Beto because I thought he’d change things?  (I live in CA, it’s just a hypothetical).
5629 2018-11-23 20:20:33 Another report oil barons can gaslight conservatives to ridicule and ignore. Witness the power of big money.
5630 2018-11-23 20:20:29 Most companies have statements about their palm oil sourcing - if it's Roundtable Certified it should be more sustainable than many other oils, if not, it's dirty palm oil and should be avoided...
5631 2018-11-23 20:20:27 Looks like your ignoring climate change and greed for oil will break America and the world. But by all means, anything for your fragile ego.
5632 2018-11-23 20:20:26 Ela avisou que só vai protocolar se a Black Oil bancar a noite de nupcias
5633 2018-11-23 20:20:17 Can you just get out .. of Alberta I mean lol  
Getting more rail cars to move the oil is NOT the answer 
We need pipelines Rachel but don’t worry that will happen in 2019 
UCP . 2019 
5634 2018-11-23 20:20:11 Surely as the world’s largest oil producer the US should be happy with a higher oil price which will protect and create jobs.
5635 2018-11-23 20:20:11 In the event of the four minute warning in #Pioppi we will cover ourselves in coconut oil to deflect the blast.
5636 2018-11-23 20:20:04 If you check the facts you’ll find that we don’t have an African gang problem and the Terror threat is global due to conservative governments worldwide invading Muslin countries and fighting wars that have nothing to with extremism but everything to do with oil and resources
5637 2018-11-23 20:19:57 Zoomer? And I suppose it is an insult when I call you a BritNat? How many times did you lot spout the lie that Scotland's oil was gone and was only a burden needing 'broad UK shoulders' to pay for decommissioning? Dozens? Hundreds? Mysteriously no mention of record oil finds.
5638 2018-11-23 20:19:53 “GPS interruptions”?

What about visual?  They could not see a huge oil tanker right in their path?

Or radar systems?  An advanced Norwegian Naval ship can not detect a much larger ship in the area, and maybe alert them to that effect?
5639 2018-11-23 20:19:49 here is your reminder that; oreo, hershey, nestle, and unilever are buying their palm oil from wilmar which is a company who pretty much is responsible for the destruction of 130,000 ha rainforest in indonesia since 2015 alone
5640 2018-11-23 20:19:44 I know the demand drivers for oil.   I can’t for the life of me of me figure it out for #crypto.    That’s why I don’t get the story of a bull run in oil translating to crypto.
5641 2018-11-23 20:19:39 Pizza thieves unfortunately don’t control oil, or help enemies from going nuclear, or maintain Middle East stability. Reality is often harsh. Why do u think our Presidents age so fast ?. These are gut wrenching decisions. Big picture needs to be seen, understood,and evaluated.
5642 2018-11-23 20:19:30 The biggest challenge the country faces is not Raila...but the many confused Kenyans who worship him blindly. It is easy to deal with Raila...it is not easy to deal with these confused Kenyans!
5643 2018-11-23 20:19:25 Keep in mind, these figures also could show debt costs vs oil price.  The chart would look the same.  That's not leadership achieving it, it's money.
5644 2018-11-23 20:19:06 Only possible way to move forward with this news is to sell more oil!
5645 2018-11-23 20:19:03 Comes down to building a pipeline to the east and they can swallow their oil , infact we don’t need it now, US  will supply us
5646 2018-11-23 20:19:02 Depends what kind of palm oil - if it's sustainable (Roundtable Certified) it's better than many other oils, if dirty palm oil (destroys habitats and ecosystems) it's an appalling product....
5647 2018-11-23 20:19:01 If you believe in all of this climate change stuff, then put your money where your mouth is:
1. Quit using your AC
2. Quit using your heat especially if you have an oil furnace 
3. Sell your car
4. Drastically reduce your electricity use
5. Quit flying

5655 2018-11-23 20:17:57 Body representing palm oil producers claims we should continue to eat palm oil to preserve rainforest! It’s demand for palm oil which has lead to the destruction - continuing to use palm oil isn’t going to stop it!

5661 2018-11-23 20:17:21 Yes it is - don't reject all palm oil, it has great potential to help the environment...
5662 2018-11-23 20:17:20 Looking forward to the climate trials where we put to death oil executives and "do nothing" politicians while civilization dies in the dark.
5663 2018-11-23 20:17:18 Yeahh dilute the tea tree oil with water then get a cotton bud/ball n apply to the area
5664 2018-11-23 20:17:08 I wonder if there would be any problems getting pipelines built if oil was produced in Ontario or Quebec?. I think we all know the answer to that!
5665 2018-11-23 20:16:56 I saw you, you saw me.
I smiled, you smiled at me.
But yo dada owns oil company
And I don't even have a job lol

5666 2018-11-23 20:16:55 oh yes now that oil price is falling like a stone seems appropriate... this is becoming a circus with too many clowns.
5667 2018-11-23 20:16:44 So if oil prices are at the lowest why are we # IN UG paying $1.35 per liter yet a barrel is at $60@minge7th @KagutaMuseveni @BrianMulondo @URA_CG

5670 2018-11-23 20:16:38 Do not buy anything that includes Palm oil!!!!
5671 2018-11-23 20:16:26 Trump definitely responsible for this cold weather opening up those oil lines under those Indian reservations for
5672 2018-11-23 20:16:23 What will happen in the earth's crust and to the atmosphere when we burn off all the oil but the fumes can't escape what's left of the atmosphere and we can't convert them cos we've cut down all the trees? We are all just complacent frogs, slowly coming to the boil in our pot.
5673 2018-11-23 20:16:19 Friendly reminder to people that humans *can’t* drink oil so maybe start focusing on keeping our drinking water as clean and safe as possible?
5674 2018-11-23 20:16:10 I think your ban on dirty palm oil is laudable, but worth stressing sustainably sourced palm oil (Roundtable Certified) is more sustainable than many other oils. It has great potential as a sustainable food source - shd only be boycotting it when it destroys land + ecosystems.
5675 2018-11-23 20:16:06 It's because he's being a hypocrite. Months ago, when he was running for president, he called Buhari's government a failure; now, without shame, he has turned around to support the same man he called a failure.

He's being hypocritical.
5676 2018-11-23 20:15:54 I wonder if the weed store has a black friday sale so i can stock up on thc oil. (“Stock up” i have like $20 lmao)
5677 2018-11-23 20:15:47 The relationship with Saudi is not because of dependence on oil, it's because they're a rich, powerful ally to have in the region. Believe me, id rather not be buying oil from OPEC, especially since hydraulic Fracturing has made it possible to profit off $30/bbl.
5678 2018-11-23 20:15:37 Trump traitor knows damn well that Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with oil prices the way they are. Trump Traitor is simply shilling for a murderer. Trump Traitor wants you to ignore the Saudi prince's order to murder a journalist pay attention to prices at the pump. Unrelated
5679 2018-11-23 20:15:30 Fools rush in. I kinda know what might later happen when I see someone at the supermarket pushing a cart loaded with gallon jugs of peanut oil. At least they have the sense to use peanut oil.
5680 2018-11-23 20:15:29 BP Clair ridge first oil today, will be 40 years production.
5681 2018-11-23 20:15:28 Instead of losing it, just ignore what oil apologists say. You kinda have to expect ignorant people to say ignorant things. (Donald Trump being a perfect example of this.)
5682 2018-11-23 20:15:25 Trump has not only pulled out of the Paris Accord, he puts coal/oil industry insiders in charge of the EPA and has rolled back regulations.
5683 2018-11-23 20:15:23 The whole thing tire person. Bros.
5684 2018-11-23 20:14:38 Yes we always do and a big shout out to bmw in namibia for sorting a oil on one of our bikes At no cost

5688 2018-11-23 20:14:17 I really need to get my oil changed but after work all I can think of is bed
5689 2018-11-23 20:14:17 But it was 'out of oil' and not only worthless but would cost billions to de-commission the wells. Scotland had to be GRATEFUL for the UK's 'broad shoulders'.  Anyone knew that.... if they listened to you lot.
5690 2018-11-23 20:14:15 And fry the kale in coconut oil. It makes it easier to slide into the garbage can!
5691 2018-11-23 20:14:02 Oil and gas still floats our boat
5692 2018-11-23 20:14:01 Go back to your cave, #FakePresident. We know you got all that Saudi oil for defending ASSASSINS & Saudi corruption. So of course your ignorance of science, self-interests,  & defense of oil will continue. Save your breath, liar. Send your emails only to your clueless voters.
5693 2018-11-23 20:13:48 I put so much product on my hair, I swear if I just stopped with all the mousse and oil and spray and wax, I’d be fine! 

Will do!
5694 2018-11-23 20:13:46 Looks like the USA are going to flood the market with oil, lowing oil prices. the Trudeau government failed us big time with no action on the pipeline issue. we should be a booming economy but we’re not. I hate to see the state of Canada in the next rescission.
5695 2018-11-23 20:13:42 Less solar lighting and power generation = more demand for oil.
Less sunlight means bio-manufactured plants=means more money for Kochs.

I see. Let's not fix the problem through our behavior let's create something that will keep the status quo comfort levels. Koch funded study?
5696 2018-11-23 20:13:42 I am sure Trudeau has nothing to do with the Oil prices drop but Harper let the Chinese buy into Alberta Oil and that's why Oil is dropping. Maybe if @kevinolearytv  was in maybe just maybe we wouldn't be in this fiasco in 2018
5697 2018-11-23 20:13:32 I participated in #BlackFriday by getting my oil changed by the same guy I've been going to since 2002. Thanks Ric for being opened today!
5698 2018-11-23 20:13:31 I’m so ducking tired. I just got tea tree oil in my eye while washing my face  good fucking night 
5699 2018-11-23 20:13:23 Thankful for what? Thankful he has kept refugees out. Your family most likely were refugees or at least immigrants! Thankful for getting oil cheaper? At the cost of an American being killed be the people he has sold us out to. I could ho on but nothing will make you change.

5702 2018-11-23 20:13:03 Who is saying we have to be nice to the oil and gas industries?
5703 2018-11-23 20:13:00 doesn't the u.s. need higher prices to justify shale exploitation and shale oil exports?
5704 2018-11-23 20:12:57 ごま油、タンスの角に指ぶつけろ。
5705 2018-11-23 20:12:56 The world knows what your priorities are: OIL. 15 of the 19 Sept 11th terrorists were from Saudi, MBS murdered our journalist. All those who ever served in uniform, those who died serving the U.S. are only worth the price of oil. Some priority heh? Sold us out for OIL!!!
5706 2018-11-23 20:12:47 In the 1960's with 90% of Africa's exports being raw materials such as oil, copper, cotton, coffee, and cocoa, food had to be imported to the continent while industrial development was intentionally thwarted by the industrialized West. #Africa #FridayFeeIing
5707 2018-11-23 20:12:38 Seriously!!!! Aligning with Saudi Arabia right after the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Money is not the bottom line. They are small suppliers of oil to US., Canada provides more oil than they do but lining your pockets produces all kinds of excuses for deplorable behavior.
5708 2018-11-23 20:12:34 What he said is patently absurd, makes no sense, and shows a lack of understanding about how global oil prices are set. Plus they were at lower points under Obama, so it’s also inaccurate. That’s not “leftist spinning,” it’s just true
5709 2018-11-23 20:12:29 Girl. I’m  this close to drinking Castor oil.
5710 2018-11-23 20:12:26 Sustainable palm oil means the orangs died more than three years ago - but they still died. Better to not use palm oil.
5711 2018-11-23 20:12:23 I was waiting for a tweet from honey and olive oil user!
5712 2018-11-23 20:12:21 For this reason expecting Trudeau's visit to Calgary to solve the oil crisis is naïve a best.

5714 2018-11-23 20:12:03 @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @dscc For the oil, Trump DEFENDS ASSASSINS and OK's  murder of journalists to come. Corrupt Saudis bought off Trump's silence, over our NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE experts. Can't wait till Democrats investigate Trump's Saudi ties. #LockHimUp
5715 2018-11-23 20:12:01 The one we were being told was 'out of oil' like supposedly all the oil fields in Scottish waters supposedly were? THAT #ClairRidge oilfield? The one that could not possibly produce oil and income for an independent Scotland? That one? Yes, I think it was that one.
5716 2018-11-23 20:11:52 God bless that persian oil money
5717 2018-11-23 20:11:49 He forgot sexist and misogynistic and xenophobic and white Supremacist Neo-Nazis who wake up and Roman-salute the oil paintings of the Fuhrer (on our walls) every morning.
5718 2018-11-23 20:11:39 2014....It's running out, a busted flush.
2018....It's here for the next 50 years at least.
The only country to get poorer on oil thanks to corporations like the BBC.

5721 2018-11-23 20:11:23 I don't believe it's the oil that makes Trump support the Prince. I believe it is two things: Saudi has something on him & money to line his pocket.
5722 2018-11-23 20:11:22 We shouldn’t be using oil at all! Canadian pipelines are destroying our land!
5723 2018-11-23 20:11:16 Would @DavidLloydUK consider using palm oil free products or products that contain sustainable palm oil in your gym cafes? #PalmOil
5724 2018-11-23 20:11:01 Mkts trades very heavy today. Some bad records are being created by this mkts. Oil plunge. Worse thanks giving losses etc.  this mkt has all the ingredients for a melt up but lacks the catalyst. Without the fed pausing or tariffs deal this mkt has little chance of a lift off.
5725 2018-11-23 20:10:55 But the typical “lesson” or impact from high dose (whatever) is sooooo antithetical to that dude’s philosophy. It’s oil and water.

5727 2018-11-23 20:10:52 What about the school girls cultural norms? Oil and water. Get them the hell out of western countries.
5728 2018-11-23 20:10:50 Why not come to your own constituency in Aberdeen and see the folk who lost their jobs in the oil downturn, who now eat from food banks whilst yiur mob did SFA for them???
5729 2018-11-23 20:10:40 This is just a lil
5730 2018-11-23 20:10:25 I saw an article about stuffing waffles. just brush oil on the waffle iron and cook. cover with turkey, gravy, and the works. To drink? a nice rustic red, not that expensive.
5731 2018-11-23 20:10:22 So you pushed for global recession and a huge glut of oil, despite sanctions on Iran, you feel a recession is a good thing because it leads to lower gas prices? #clueless #ignorant How stupid do you think we are?

5734 2018-11-23 20:10:10 we do go lower. every. single. day. 

I'm old enough to remember when oil was under $45 a barrel.

Just before you became @POTUS. 

Coincidence? 


5735 2018-11-23 20:10:03 Endless oil story
5736 2018-11-23 20:09:55 Oh, I am sure there's still plenty of opportunity to fail, my Queen.
*takes the bottle to get more oil, let's it slips through her fingers and it hits you on the knee* Oops.
5737 2018-11-23 20:09:54 Satan decieves. He always does. West would have innovated its way out without subsidies - to a better world if we did the right thing decades back. Yet we propped up nations with poor values for cheap oil. Cheap oil held back the growth and investments in renewables.
5738 2018-11-23 20:09:43 The only reason why y'all are so bitter about this man is because he chose PMB over Atiku , what else do y'all want?

5740 2018-11-23 20:09:41 I agree with you 
He tried to paint an oil picture using bingo Dobber. 
If he had the players it could of been so different
5741 2018-11-23 20:09:41 Just seen on the news that the price of oil is at a year low. I wonder when we’ll see Petrol and Diesel prices come down. 
5742 2018-11-23 20:09:30 Unbelievable! (Have you heard of The Powderworkers Peter? It's a Facebook Site, with over 7000 Members, from all over the World, who Love Midnight Oil. I know lots of O/seas ones have Ordered the DVD/CD etc. I wonder if any of our English ones have had this trouble too.)
5743 2018-11-23 20:09:27 Sanction Oil!  NO SAUDI IMPORTS TO US!  1. We have to cut use of Oil to save the Human Race. 2. More Tax incentives for Alternative Energy!  That should hit the Saudis Hard & SAVE THE HUMAN RACE AT THE SAME TIME! I know Oil owns a lot of people #SaudiSanctions.  Thoughts? RT
5744 2018-11-23 20:09:27 I don't know what Scotland would do with all this Oil revenue.  Well as matters stand they don't need to worry.
5745 2018-11-23 20:09:22 Doesn't the Rang Tan film say, in writing, at the end, that they'll not be using palm oil in its own products until all palm oil is demonstrably deforestation-free? I don't boycott palm oil - but I refuse to use any that's not demonstrably deforestation-free.

5748 2018-11-23 20:09:14 Lie! What has happened is that your spokesperson Trump sold us out for the price of Saudi oil. MBS murdered our journalist, and 15 of the 19 Sept 11th terrorists were from Saudi. Fake patriots! You hug the flag with one hand while you burn it with the other.
5749 2018-11-23 20:09:09 It wasn’t ‘as a new field starts’, I’m sure it was ‘because a new field starts’ blaming 6% drop in crude oil prices on the new field coming in stream!

5752 2018-11-23 20:08:59 Look past your superficialness and realize that Trump saw no reason to cause trouble over one man who was a very bad person to screw up our economy. Not counting what affects it would have on our oil trade.
5753 2018-11-23 20:08:58 Washington voters voted to authorize some of the most sweeping gun reform measures at over 60% but say no on climate change. I don’t get it - completely baffling. People bought into big oil’s smear campaign. 
5754 2018-11-23 20:08:57 Pakistani are paying the price in form of these killings. We should not help Americans in their war for land n oil. Please stop this n dont blame muslims all the time for terrorism.
5755 2018-11-23 20:08:51 Sometimes I tweet about my poop on my nsfw twitter because nobody follows it but at least I ... Shared my poop I guess????? Anyway let's all be robots that only have coolant and oil as fluids and never as excretions
5756 2018-11-23 20:08:50 How does my car already need an oil change..
5757 2018-11-23 20:08:47 CNBC Oil tumbles more than 7% to $50.42, down more than 30% in 7 weeks  The latest wave of energy market selling comes amid escalating concerns about an increase in global supply and a slowdown in economic growth, plus the Saudi Prince is killing journalists - the Maket is hosed

5762 2018-11-23 20:07:58 Made a lotion with all natural coconut oil x unrefined shea butter and when i say it’s doing wonders for my skin . 

Ash whea !?
5763 2018-11-23 20:07:57 Oil is a very important component.  Syria is important for Russia because the shipment of oil. Russia is surrounded by unusable water access most of the year. Russian aggression is to access shipping lanes. Low oil prices crush Russia’s economy. No guns needed.
5764 2018-11-23 20:07:48 We may all be forced to relocate if we don't radically change our oil sucking habits...

5767 2018-11-23 20:07:28 "ST"... what if oil plans to go up from its 76.4% Fib of 42.05-76.41 at 50.16, which it tagged perfectly today. Could TLT fall if Oil stages a rebound? It sure didn't rise much after a 34% drop in Oil inside 2 months 
5768 2018-11-23 20:07:16 Oil’s not all about fuel for energy. Lots of other uses including pharmaceuticals

5771 2018-11-23 20:06:53 Oil dey your head wella... So irritating
5772 2018-11-23 20:06:53 But, isn’t the crude oil produced here not used for gasoline?  Isn’t it a different grade?  Not arguing - just asking.
5773 2018-11-23 20:06:50 Defiantly boom time coming! Little boost from the council vote next week then spud then big oil hit news. Happy days ukonshore!
5774 2018-11-23 20:06:44 They are sitting on oil.  Why else when they want nuclear than to build a bomb?
5775 2018-11-23 20:06:38 Ok sir, Kaduna debt profile in 2015 was 46BN, and the repayment period of the 350MN loan was 50years, at 0.5 interest rate.
5776 2018-11-23 20:06:33 You have to think lots of corporate debt did not consider 50 dollar oil. So yes.
5777 2018-11-23 20:06:10 @WhitlockJason Heard you say on your show that you’re going to be here at Lucas Oil Stadium for the IHSAA Football State Championship Games. Is there any way that I could get to meet you today?
5778 2018-11-23 20:06:09 Too late. Neither PDP Nor APC his destination is dustbin of history.
5779 2018-11-23 20:06:09 I stand corrected on the Low class Oil Trash. They brought that one themselves it appears. As to Trudeau, he may say he understands, but it is another thing to actually do something about it. That has not changed.
5780 2018-11-23 20:06:06 Omg I wish our school was that extreme, but no... being in the Oil and Gas capital sucks when it came to chemistry.
5781 2018-11-23 20:06:02 Sitting on so much oil surprised we haven't actually slipped away from England.
5782 2018-11-23 20:06:01 Basically not until alternative energy is cheaper than coal and oil.

5784 2018-11-23 20:05:53 Better question if it’s necessary to have complete moratorium of oil tankers on Northern BC coastline. Why isn’t similar moratorium on the East Coast also necessary
5785 2018-11-23 20:05:44 Utilities don't buy to consume next month like coal or oil. They buy so they have fuel in 2 years time. They already have manufactured fuel for the next 2- 3 years so they can wait...but not too much longer. There is a Grand Canyon of a supply deficit coming.
5786 2018-11-23 20:04:55 Sell him the technology for $1Trillion. After all, they've ripped the US off for oil for years!
5787 2018-11-23 20:04:49 EV haters should be promoted to drink crude oil. Let them see how that goes.
5788 2018-11-23 20:04:49 @realDonaldTrump This guy is an idiot. Oil crash will flush economy and begin layoffs in energy sector hurting US energy business. He just doesn't understand economics. Time to vote out. Failure President!!
5789 2018-11-23 20:04:42 I guess? Not sure about it but I know some ppl that rode up there on motorcycles. All oil land. Apparently the Canadian route up there is better bc ppl are more friendly/relaxed. Route up past Inuvik is VERY seasonal, tho.
5790 2018-11-23 20:04:41 Anyone else reading this snake oil don't be fooled. Hitler himself called communism "diametrically opposed" to fascism and admitted he stole the name "socialist" from real socialists to fool the easily manipulated.
5791 2018-11-23 20:04:27 it's from both PACs and individuals who work for oil and gas co's.
5792 2018-11-23 20:04:17 Oh, excellent! I've never heard of using peppermint oil for that, but if it works, it works! yay, go you!
5793 2018-11-23 20:04:07 Put the oven around 450, cut them into 8ths, cover with olive oil and chili powder and bake for 30. Great fries
5794 2018-11-23 20:03:54 Also, the Government WANTS oil, they would give it up. They are actually AGAINST EVs. This is the main problem.
5795 2018-11-23 20:03:53 Me then @Cpt_Tintin We wan chop something debee ...we are over that palm oil life 
5796 2018-11-23 20:03:52 Tell me how, in a world pushing to sunset, or at the very least, curtail oil production for the last 20 years, you think it’s Liberals, who’ve only been in power 3 years, are to blame for not planning ahead or not understanding the motives of a very profit motivated consumer?
5797 2018-11-23 20:03:41 Been using rose oil on my face every night before bed.

Low income immigrants, migrants, illegal aliens compete for existing housing.

5799 2018-11-23 20:03:37 Cheap oil. Is it worth it?
5800 2018-11-23 20:03:35 Take ownership that you are a repressive kingdom, you are so own up to it. OR are you afraid that countries will stop selling you arms and buy your oil?
5801 2018-11-23 20:03:30 I think Canada should tell Trump to get all his oil from his buddy in Saudi Arabia
5802 2018-11-23 20:03:30 C'est super l'écologie, la Planète et tout le toutim. Mais quand vous dites à une personne qui le 20 du mois sait quelles acrobaties il va devoir faire pour nourrir ses enfants que c'est très bien de payer le gas oil à 1.50€, ne vous étonnez PAS qu'il vous regarde bizarrement.

5813 2018-11-23 20:02:18 The oil survey of the west coast is available to see online, huge oil fields in the west coast surveyed in the 60s. However these were buried by the MOD due to the Trident subs routes in and out of port. #DissolveTheUnion

Or I'll cut down a tree with my pickup running just to listen to my radio
5819 2018-11-23 20:01:21 Imagine a huge new source of revenue had just come onstream that would pay for everything we wanted in education. Like millions of barrels of oil. Now imagine campaigning to ensure that all the revenues are collected by another government sitting in a different country. Crazy eh?
5820 2018-11-23 20:01:20 Too Brave Sons of Soil... . pls correct SONS OF OIL.
5821 2018-11-23 20:01:17 Thank you for speaking out against bipartisanship.
Every reasonable canadian sits in the center.

Even the progressive conseevatives are a center party.
The oil issue is an economic vs environmental and a provincial issue.
5822 2018-11-23 20:01:11 That man in front of you is really gonna stand in line for 2 hours to buy a 6 Quart oil less fryer oven LMAO
5823 2018-11-23 20:01:10 He was released again after the crime, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
5824 2018-11-23 20:00:50 is that like a depression meal when you've got only a loaf of bread and a cooking oil in the kitchen?
5825 2018-11-23 20:00:49 How do you know these fires were at 1100°F??

Remember: most of these house fires have lots of fuel inside, namely stuff. They burn for hours.

So far right??

Don't forget any gas or oil. Even in California, there's gas for heat & water heaters. To add to the heat.

5827 2018-11-23 20:00:40 I get your concern. Smoking is as real a threat as oil and nutrition.  If EV is not your prong of activity, what are your activities against smoking? Any programs you’re running? Work with legislation, work with producers, public education measures you funded or developed?
5828 2018-11-23 20:00:33 The 'other people's money' trope is infantile. It's our collective wealth. Why do a few get the reward for oil underground that's millions of years old?. Why do some sell us natural water?. Why do some live like kings due to their ancient ancestors being gifted common land?
5829 2018-11-23 20:00:32 Good luck once you do it once you'll realize it's the quickest and cleanest way to cook the bird. Use peanut oil has a higher smoking temp. When the oil cools you can filter it through  a pair of sheer panty hose and resuse it.
5830 2018-11-23 20:00:23 Oh dear, Deficits won't matter until they do. The world will discover that Canada is not as closely bound to the  US economy as before our oil and gas are crashing and we are running up big deficits. Countries have crashed before and no one is immune, even one with a lapdog press
5831 2018-11-23 20:00:19 Now we see what the oil companies r doing 2 the ppl in Sth Sudan. U sleazy low life knuckle dragging scum bags. Get that contamination cleaned up. U will b charged by the Int'l Criminal Court.! RUANG Sth Sudan has been poisoned by oil next 2 a village.
5832 2018-11-23 20:00:18 Your skin may be secreting more oil to try and compensate for the lack of moisture...
5833 2018-11-23 20:00:14 Long story short fat is mostly a toxin build up... kinda like when oil spills and they toss saw dust on it to clean it up... oil being toxins and fat being saw dust. Cardio induces sweating which is one of the best ways to seep toxins from the body thus fat percentage has to drop

5837 2018-11-23 20:00:01 Back to your earlier point about Iranians not able to take on the Iranian government themselves and this relying on trump Saudis Israel pressure how did the Iranian people get rid of the equally oil rich and more powerful shah?
5838 2018-11-23 20:00:00 Bruscetta;
Tomato, basil, olive oil and garlic, grilled ciabatta
5839 2018-11-23 19:59:41 Olive oil
5840 2018-11-23 19:59:37 Things are good. Weather is a balmy -3C, could be worse. Have you ever tried oil? I’m going to try that instead of weed.
5841 2018-11-23 19:59:27 Atleast @ShehuSani got this one right.  Congratulations to those that benefited from it.
5842 2018-11-23 19:59:24 Why it's hypocritical for oil companies to now ask Alberta government to manipulate market prices. This's a terrific insightful piece on mess created by the Conservative governments & Oil companies in Alberta.
5843 2018-11-23 19:59:09 ..nuts Jobs & Oil!
5844 2018-11-23 19:59:08 Im actually checking ingredients for palm oil now:(
5845 2018-11-23 19:59:02 Now that Oil ain't a thing, Alberta is going to have to get rich on Canola Oil.
5846 2018-11-23 19:58:58 Hi @SpoonguruUK and @Tesco would you consider adding a palm fat/oil filter to your dietary/lifestyle preferences on the Tesco groceries app?
5847 2018-11-23 19:58:50 But, if global oil demand indeed increases for the next 22 years, does it do much good for that to be satisfied by suppliers other than Alberta? I think that's a big part of the concern in this province right now and why there's such a focus on pipelines.
5848 2018-11-23 19:58:46 Also, every time we talk about oil production without considering where and how we can replace it, we further seal our own doom.
5849 2018-11-23 19:58:43 Are you not considering that oil taxes are one of the most significant sources of government revenue? I fully expect Italy to gobble All the lower oil cost as tax. @gianlucac1 @DiMartinoBooth
5850 2018-11-23 19:58:43 You mean because you sold America’s soul and morals to Saudi Arabia and let them get away with MURDER!!!  You are not responsible for lower gas prices, besides, didn’t you say that America was exporting oil for the first time? Who cares what the world sells oil for...
5851 2018-11-23 19:58:39 Well we're still selling product at a loss. Dumb. Why not just decrease production and sell when oil prices higher. Irreversible loss of resources and profits just for the $ the $bill yo! @OilGasCanada @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau @jkenney Who really profits from waste of $$?
5852 2018-11-23 19:58:33 @realDonaldTrump and every other Republican has been paid off by all the big energy and oil companies who would fail if the US policy on climate change became sufficient enough to combat climate change. Donald Trump is bought and paid for!!
5853 2018-11-23 19:58:30 I've been hearing coconut oil, it must be the wave
5854 2018-11-23 19:58:24 Listen I’m just trying to get a Black Friday deal on an oil change. $41 at valvoline got me fuckkkkked up 
5855 2018-11-23 19:58:18 1960's. Time Magazine "the next Ice Age".  1970s No oil left by year 2000.  1980s. The earth can not sustain 7billion people. 1990s global warming. 2000s Climate Change. Doomsayers always have something. $$$$$$
5856 2018-11-23 19:58:14 Have uuu tried that Clove oil babe?
5857 2018-11-23 19:58:14 While we are all in the midst of recovering from our Thanksgiving #FoodComa, we want to #GiveThanks for the manufacturers, construction workers, technicians, oil workers and all other laborers in #America. #Thanksgiving
5858 2018-11-23 19:58:10 #steakbites with a side of golf and Oil sounds like a great afternoon. Don’t forget the #Gibbies
5859 2018-11-23 19:58:06 Oil is not the future. Analogy is wrong!!! Keystone approval was stopped by another US Judge! Better plan would be to refine more with less reliance on connecting to refineries so far away!!!!
5860 2018-11-23 19:58:04 Brent oil now near 59 down from 86. Macro improve a lot. INR has improved but strong rupee does not help exports. Indian exports has fallen mainly due to this reason. China has deprecated their currency to compensate for US tariffs so that it do not impact exports.
5861 2018-11-23 19:58:00 40 years they have actually known of the potential but were held back by technology. By 2008 in an 8pt BBC documentary - Truth, Lies, Oil and Scotland -the technology was close, by 2014 it was certain.I find it strange as Brexit is about to hit this HUGE find is all over the news
5862 2018-11-23 19:57:55 Jak najbardziej jest poważny bo sprzedają nam "tanią" energię (o czym sam zresztą mówił w Polsce). I właśnie dlatego, choć lubię babkę za szczerość, to niech znowu tak nie kozaczy bo jeżeli się to posypie to komu Jankesi będą opychać swoje shale gas i shale oil ?
5863 2018-11-23 19:57:50 We talkin crude oil here?
5864 2018-11-23 19:57:49 Your patent company tests on animals.... palm oil and Gelatine are not cruelty free.  One destroys the habitat of an endangered (almost extinct) animal. Gelatine requires murder.
5865 2018-11-23 19:57:34 Somebody once told me on Twitter that I didn't know about the oil industry despite my 30 years working in it  
5866 2018-11-23 19:57:34 Getting my lil oil changed
5867 2018-11-23 19:57:31 No, I'm not referring to that. Google "Canadian oil subsidies", or read the articles I've posted in this thread.
5868 2018-11-23 19:57:22 I saw a video of how a girl was used by yahoo boys in a hotel, she was found dead and some disgusting maggots like insects were coming out of her private parts, Subhanallah you girls should be very careful following Benz driving small bois you can birth around.
5869 2018-11-23 19:56:56 The oil consumer in me is happy. The investor in me is worried.
5870 2018-11-23 19:56:51 Dec 2. Dont forget the oil puns.
5871 2018-11-23 19:56:34 Mr. Trump,
  Have y'all thought about just using the resources that GOD has blessed  America with, more and slow the use of foreign oil? We could continue to develop other sources of fuel in the mean time! BTW, You're doing quite a Good Job!! Will continue to Pray for you & U.S.A
5872 2018-11-23 19:56:31 สีสวยยยยย
5873 2018-11-23 19:56:20 Why doing all that now? They are same people and same characters. It's a shame
5874 2018-11-23 19:56:19 Dont wash more than 3 times a week and use coconut oil while air drying
5875 2018-11-23 19:56:10 Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Grease 4 ramekins or aluminum muffin molds.

In a medium bowl whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and baking soda.

Whisk in oil and vanilla extract. Gradually add milk until batter is well combined and smooth.
5876 2018-11-23 19:55:53 A few people using oil is not a big problem, except for those who are betting on oil use increasing.
5877 2018-11-23 19:55:44 Great. You might want to request for some additional English lessons too. It's "built" and "paid". My dear, brother
5878 2018-11-23 19:55:41 Of course they block our pipelines. That's how they keep us from getting our resources to market. Yet they keep buying OUR oil at a premium, and then sell it for a HUGE profit. All while we as a nation slowly starve to death. My grandparents would be spinning in their graves.
5879 2018-11-23 19:55:37 I'll be heading that way shortly. You have a few oil blends I'm dying to get <3
5880 2018-11-23 19:55:35 Quiet voice...The USA is now producing most of their own oil, and non-electric vehicle growth has slowed dramatically in China...
5881 2018-11-23 19:55:28 You don’t grow soybeans or have a dairy farm or rely on water subsidies to irrigate crops or drill for oil etc etc etc.  the list goes on.
5882 2018-11-23 19:55:06 The heat source is a nuclear reactor,  the power plant is still a steam turbine plant, instead of burning oil or coal the nuclear reactor creates the steam.
5883 2018-11-23 19:54:48 Aberdeen airport is a joke. Oil capital of Europe with an airport that has opening hours?  Should have moved to outskirts years ago & accommodated international/long haul flights. Absolutely no vision whatsoever.
5884 2018-11-23 19:54:46 *I cast you a sheepish grin as I reach for the bottle, holding it up to look at it for a moment, before I open it and cautiously pour some of the oil in my hands*
Of course, my Queen!
*I start to gently massage your legs*
5885 2018-11-23 19:54:33 Oh I get it, it trying to link the two, lol libs! Other article criticized him for causing world econ slowing down n a glut of oil production causing lower prices
5886 2018-11-23 19:54:09 Good eve po  sir kasama po kaya ang oil and gas company po dito s libya at mga medical workers po . Pwede ko po ipadala yung letter po nnn
5887 2018-11-23 19:54:00 Why now? Well better late than never
5888 2018-11-23 19:53:58 SA are mates because they are trying to overthrow Iran all in the name of land and oil theft! Israel's history of land theft is not history it's still happening!
5889 2018-11-23 19:53:50 No oil here, nothing to see here
5890 2018-11-23 19:53:47 Forgot I need to do an oil change 
5891 2018-11-23 19:53:45 You can also drive to Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic but I would recommend sticking to Canada. Fewer oil trucks
5892 2018-11-23 19:53:37 that oil got my hair growing fast  my braids too cute to take out
5893 2018-11-23 19:53:33 Picked a great day to put oil in my car . Cold af.
5894 2018-11-23 19:53:31 I cut sugar out of my tea a couple of months ago.Never thought I'd do that..I am still missing  it.. But,something just clicked & made me do it.What about the cannabis oil? I have read many times that an alkaline body is the way.,Practice is much harder :)
5895 2018-11-23 19:53:31 I suggest you go to Saudi Arabia, drink some oil at a tesla supercharger and have to be taken to a hospital. People like you just slow progress and do not show anything for it.
5896 2018-11-23 19:53:30 Is it just me, but every time I go in to change my oil, 99 other problems magically appear that “need” to be taken care of... 
5897 2018-11-23 19:53:27 No different than the global freezing hoax of the 70’s. Big oil investors needed an excuse to ration gasoline and skyrocket the price. It’s all about the money. Same hoax, different Libs.
5898 2018-11-23 19:53:25 By living with no provincial tax to begin with...you are the only province or territory to be free of PST/HST. You could allow this tax and use it to develop new economic sectors to become less reliant on oil.
5899 2018-11-23 19:53:24 Ok, so what is hash oil???  Is that the weed oil that goes in the vape things??  I know I sound stupid but never done that stuff so Im street drug stupid. Lol
5900 2018-11-23 19:53:21 La bajada del precio del petróleo se produce porque hay más oferta que demanda.
Obtenemos un oil black friday que ayudará a los consumidores.
Lo malo sería que faltara petróleo.
5901 2018-11-23 19:53:20 Indeed. I should be doing  both, but i’m currently organising old hand-made mediums, oil paints and wrapping pictures in archival paper due to London’s moisture/damp

5903 2018-11-23 19:53:00 Oil $UWT may rip come.monday
5904 2018-11-23 19:52:49 my hair & skin are at the healthiest they have ever been and it’s really been b/c I use so much coconut oil
5905 2018-11-23 19:52:48 buahaha!  It took me YEARS to get to the point where my hair doesn't get oily after 2 days.  I stopped using dry shampoo, and if I"m really desperate, I'll put baby powder on my hair at night.  But.... what really helps me is keeping my hair curly.  It hides all the oil.  lol
5906 2018-11-23 19:52:42 I remember environmental science class in the early nineties when the worst thing anyone could think of happening was running out of oil
5907 2018-11-23 19:52:27 So you would rather have the oil industry fail? Do you know what that does to the Canadian economy? As an Albertan, I know exactly what it is doing to the economy.
5908 2018-11-23 19:52:27 My brother has a nut allergy. I want to go to Chick-fil-A but isn’t it cooked in peanut oil?
5909 2018-11-23 19:52:27 Nuke Saudi Arabia. Those murderers are responsible for the plunging oil prices.
5910 2018-11-23 19:52:24 Got a Black Friday deal on my oil change hehe
5911 2018-11-23 19:52:19 Plus capital investment decisions at the likes of BP are made on a global basis, so a lack of tax breaks in UK can mean investing elsewhere globally, based on Ret On Capital models.  (However they will always come back at some point, possibly driven by oil prices and outlook).
5912 2018-11-23 19:52:16 It is running out. You are aware that other fields are closing all the time? Production of gas and oil peaked at 244 million tonnes in 1999. Since then it has declined dramatically to 89 million tonnes in 2018. It will continue to decline each year.
5913 2018-11-23 19:52:08 #BlackFridayDeals #crude #oil
5914 2018-11-23 19:52:08 all of oil?
5915 2018-11-23 19:52:04 Dear Kenney sock puppet account; maybe you should realize:
1. The tweet is doctored to leave out the closing line
2. The province is more than oil workers. If you have a problem with oil workers' jobs maybe take it up with oil companies making billions & firing front line workers
5916 2018-11-23 19:52:00 No, Texas learned its lesson from the last oil time prices dropped to $20.  Texas became more Technology for the past 20yrs vs Oil.
5917 2018-11-23 19:52:00 Just saw an article saying oil stock is in trouble or something. Thank or blame the Saudis..
5918 2018-11-23 19:51:55 First off, you dont sell a journalist's soul for oil
5919 2018-11-23 19:51:55 Three examples of us 'stopping an invasion of Canada'.
Canada provides 40% of our oil and Trump tarrifs them.
Saudi Arabia provides 11% of our oil and Trump says 'thanks for 911 and go ahead and kill anyone you want.'
5920 2018-11-23 19:51:54 They have to fix the price of oil and so they use emissions as an excuse to Control how much gets drilled each year to prevent over drilling which would be disastrous, so they tell a lie to serve a bigger truth.
5921 2018-11-23 19:51:42 If @POTUS is serious about making America great again why isn't he seeking energy independence?  Isn't Saudi oil the opposite of made in America?
5922 2018-11-23 19:51:40 Yes shipbrokers talk to each other two sub divisions in shipping mate. I specialise in dry cargo that too in plant and machinery side, also bulk commodities. Eg steel, rice, cement, wheat etc etc. Other side is oil. But in major broking houses like clarkson’s, SSY and others >>
5923 2018-11-23 19:51:36 Those numbers aren’t from the oil and gas industry. They’re from voters that identify as working for oil/gas and from PACs. Anyone who runs in TX is likely to have donors (individuals) who work in the industry. I’m not a huge Beto fan. Just tired of these stats being misread.
5924 2018-11-23 19:51:34 Do you use palm oil in your products?
5925 2018-11-23 19:51:30 Yes, but oil prices are, to skip a few nuances, global in nature. So Saudi supply does affect the US pump price. That said, they’re starving Yemen and killed a journalist - so Trump should isolate and sanction, not praise, them.
5926 2018-11-23 19:51:29 getting an oil change!
5927 2018-11-23 19:51:24 You didn't do shit. There's a huge supply of oil, leaving the demand. The only thing you did was let the crown prince kill a reporter that with no punishment from you because you're a coward.
5928 2018-11-23 19:51:15 GLAD TO SEE THAT 4 years After Cameron visited Shetland re this Oil find
It’s finally get mentioned 
Funny How it was blocked by our 
FRIENDLY FREE OF SPEECH MEDIA
UNTIL NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5929 2018-11-23 19:51:09 When I have my ounce of margarine for breakfast I think about that indigo hairdo more often than not.
5930 2018-11-23 19:51:09 My coat is practically hookup ready I’ve got a spare underwear, toiletry kit, argan oil.. she means business
5931 2018-11-23 19:51:01 My true source is your regime issuing contradictory statement every once in a while for over a month. Lowering oil prices by trump's orders to cover it up.. The CIA's conclusion... A lie doesn't last long! Stupidity my friend is not believing #MBS  ordered the brutal killing!
5932 2018-11-23 19:50:53 According to Express Oil and Estes I need either “your father or your husband” to deal with my @Michelin tire issues. I’m glad I’m in my 30s and completed 2 tours in the Middle East, so I could receive some good old fashioned gender discrimination for being a female.
5933 2018-11-23 19:50:50 As an artist, I'm sure you're fully apprised of the scientific method.

Now tell me about all the oil from sunken ships in 2 world wars and how that pollution destroyed humanity.
5934 2018-11-23 19:50:44 #RememberVenezuela  Used to be a very Rich place and all people had everything they needed.  Used to be Oil rich.... but then @Ocasio2018 Socialism took over!!
5935 2018-11-23 19:50:31 Wow, Matt, that's really good - especially with (cheap) acrylics and not oil! And for a first-time at painting. You got skills.
5936 2018-11-23 19:50:30 Wow you need more than a oil change for real  you gon drive off and it’s gonna break
5937 2018-11-23 19:50:28 I think it’s guns, not oil, that he wants to sell to the Saudi’s.  The NRA would never allow the arms deal to die, just the reporter!
5938 2018-11-23 19:50:24 Well, I’m the MD fola oil Ltd on the ring road... what r u into?
5939 2018-11-23 19:50:24 Someone once threw a bottle of Omega 3 pills at me. Don't worry, I only suffered super fish oil injuries. #fricomedy
5940 2018-11-23 19:50:18 I remember Jimmy Carters famous speech about we were simply running out of oil by year 2000. He said it was the biggest crisis man will ever face. Idiots.
5941 2018-11-23 19:50:16 My jobs roasts em just oil salt pepper then add bacon when we finish cooking em off. I do mine at home pretty similar. Sometimes sauté with some shallot or onion and have some balsamic vinegar too!
5942 2018-11-23 19:50:08 It is not a fact ... it is a misinformed.  Any business can deduct its expenses but when oil industry does its called a subsidy?
5943 2018-11-23 19:50:08 Things feel tense today. Nothing a lil meditation, water, and CBD oil can’t cure
5944 2018-11-23 19:50:07 Now is the time to do something "right". Continue to pollute via the tar sands, oil production or change the focus to renewable energy  - wind turbines, solar panels and other endeavours! For those coming behind us !
5945 2018-11-23 19:50:03 Can anyone tell me how often #Alberta has been in a crisis? Like clockwork evert time the oil market turns bear! Bail outs and subsidies are your equalization payments. #ableg #cdnpoli
5946 2018-11-23 19:49:50 As an oil worker who has friends all over the UK working offshore, you are absolute loonies. Goodnight
5947 2018-11-23 19:49:48 WE MUST say ENOUGH to the oil/gas industries. #ClimateChange 
5948 2018-11-23 19:49:46 Can't wait for a black owned YouTube with shea butter, coconut oil & Afro comb ads
5949 2018-11-23 19:49:37 I am with Burke on this one. It is up to them if they want to do it or not. But personally I think it is cringe worthy to watch. I am thankful the Oil are not doing anything like that.
5950 2018-11-23 19:49:29 You can have your country back when the UK has pumped all your oil out 
5951 2018-11-23 19:49:18 Has he got an opinion as to why the oil price has plummeted ?
5952 2018-11-23 19:49:16 Dear @BBCNews @BBCNewsPR can you tell me why my 2 year old just heard a ‘news’ story about a welsh guy who burnt his wife to death with chip oil? Why is anyone hearing this kind of news? It’s not important, not educational, not part of a trend. It’s death porn. Please stop it.
5953 2018-11-23 19:49:10 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
5954 2018-11-23 19:49:06 I believe the CIA. They would have no reason to lie. If the US wants oil, Trump has to play nice with murdering monsters that severely abuse women, starve babies and little children and murder viciously anyone who disagrees with their atrocities. Donald did what he had to do ...
5955 2018-11-23 19:49:03 I need oil sheen for my hair
5956 2018-11-23 19:48:56 Is @realDonaldTrump owned by oil and coal or just straight up stupid? Both?
5957 2018-11-23 19:48:56 The dead heart - Midnight Oil
5958 2018-11-23 19:48:40 Remember back in 2008?  One of the first signs of massive economic collapse?  Oil prices began to drop significantly.  Guess what's happening right now?

Get ready. It's going to be worse this time
5959 2018-11-23 19:48:38 #TheAtikuPlan documented plan still need review to address more realities. 

The part i ve covered seem to be generic policies and if implemented as stated might not address the reality 

The Oil & Gas is a typical example
5960 2018-11-23 19:48:37 It’s not one issue. It’s oil. And Iran. And risk of Russia setting up based. And Middle East control/presence. Sorry to say this, and as Sad as this khashoggi incident might be, this is not worth severing our ties with Saudi.
5961 2018-11-23 19:48:32 Do you still need a rosary, a crucifix, or bottle of oil or mantle before you pray?
Listen,
A Christian is a man who requires no medium or object to communicate with God

The spirit of Christ is our only medium and access to the Father.
5962 2018-11-23 19:48:21 why dont we all stick to one fact and clearly expose it. 
America imports 9% of oil from S.A. and 40% from Canada. 
Why would oil prices sky rocket?
I hes worried about oil prices, why isnt he kissing Trudeau's a**.?
5963 2018-11-23 19:48:10 Brent #crudeoil has fallen from high of $86 this year to the levels of $58. That's huge relief for oil importing countries which will lower the fiscal and current account deficit. But may be bad news for oil exporting countries and esp if they are in economic constrains
5964 2018-11-23 19:48:06 They think they are clever.  Really they are fucking amateur bullies.  Bullies are the scum of the earth.  Who gives a flying whatever about the flick flack of watches and handbags.  Can't put a proper sentence together any of them PAH
5965 2018-11-23 19:48:03 yes I agree and while we are at it lets stop buying Saudi oil too
5966 2018-11-23 19:47:57 In the waiting room of jiffy lube while I get my oil changed, and this motherfucker in here has a MAGA phone case.
5967 2018-11-23 19:47:55 Screw it. I didn’t change my oil on time so I’m not going to do it all. Just let it keep getting worse until the motor sticks
5968 2018-11-23 19:47:47 Where's your location
5969 2018-11-23 19:47:26 So vets, seniors, homeless and Canada’s natives are all doing without. Canadas entire oil industry is at critical levels. Yet, @JustinTrudeau thinks it’s a priority to spend tax dollars on media and hotels for ILLEGAL migrants. This is the most corrupt government to ever govern.
5970 2018-11-23 19:47:25 Your forgetting that where people normally have brains, Trump has S@&T....he literally has S@&T for brains.

He’s a snake oil salesman.  A conman.  You think he understands anything about land development other than who to bribe?
5971 2018-11-23 19:47:20 got to love an uneducated liberal supporting but food like this woman she has no clue what oil is provided her over the years or her family
5972 2018-11-23 19:47:17 Thanks to Saudi Arabia how ??  The last thing they want is the price of oil to drop! Trump is a hell of conman..
5973 2018-11-23 19:47:03 I can confirm Canada has not.Canada, too,is largest exporter of oil to US.

SA and MbS has been treated better than CDA, our neighbor and ally.

US has a trade deficit with SA.  US has a trade surplus with CDA;2016 data.

Canada doesn't commit murder and gets shit on. SA?
5974 2018-11-23 19:46:57 Got plenty of books, thanks  10% of oil which we get from Middle East (primarily Saudi) is over 2 million barrels a day - significant amount. Russians would GLADLY pay for the Saudi troops- presence/control of Middle East too critical. Will u risk Iran going nuclear over this?
5975 2018-11-23 19:46:56 Got my oil changed for 23 dollars today and got gas for 2.25 Raleigh could never 
5976 2018-11-23 19:46:55 It's par for the course in the oil business.Compared with where it was a couple of years ago it's doing OK. Of course if the UK Govs had had the foresight of the Norwegian Govs the accumulated fund takes care of all downturns in the oil price & is replenished when it rises again.
5977 2018-11-23 19:46:55 @NNorma192 don't go to any Hospital use any social program or anything that oil is paid for in this country over the years because you are a huge hypocrite get off your computer and your smartphone Stripped out of your clothes burn your home it's all got petrol products in it
5978 2018-11-23 19:46:50 A field 50% larger that the Forties Field. The Forties Field is expected to continue producing into the 2030s - 60 years after it first came on stream.  In an Independent Scotland - Claire alone could supply Scotland's Oil and Gas needs for all that time.
5979 2018-11-23 19:46:49 Ted Cruz ran countless pro oil ads prior to election. Will be interesting to see if Washington comes to the rescue of the oil market in Dec.
5980 2018-11-23 19:46:34 I think Trudeau is trying to make it as clear as he can, without flaming the fires of western alienation any further, that he sees no future in the oil business. It would be folly to expect him to do anything to extend its life. AB is clearly on his "do not resuscitate" list.
5981 2018-11-23 19:46:30 Total restoration of the plane, including cleaning and resetting the angle plates, polishing and sharpening the blade? About 30’. A skim of light machine oil (and proper storage) should keep this guy rust-free for the next 30 years.
5982 2018-11-23 19:46:28 I'd still stay away from oil as it has further room to fall. Should be seeing a $48 handle soon. Your radar should have $XOM @ $73 patience
5983 2018-11-23 19:46:23 Despite the typo, "oil line" seemed quite topical and appropos. Harry's getting a direct pipeline to 'deliver the goods' and facilitate inner workings back to good health!
5984 2018-11-23 19:46:19 olive oil, monkfish, and root veggie roll. . .17

وتقدرون تلعبون في المعادله والنتيجه وحده, لكن حاليا اتوقع هذي الاصح لوضعنا حاليا.
وشكرا
5986 2018-11-23 19:46:07 Because you own the oil in SA and u know it iodit
5987 2018-11-23 19:46:03 Taking our cues from Trump?? JT is more dangerous by far than Donald Trump! And what do u expect PM Zoolander to do? Or Trump for that matter??  If JT gave a shit about Canada, or this journalist, he’d build pipelines. Get off Saudi Oil!!!!
5988 2018-11-23 19:45:55 Zeytinyaglilar/ Appetizers with olive oil
Sarma : Stuffed grape leaves
Kisir : Bulgur salad (Turkish tabbouleh*)
5989 2018-11-23 19:45:50 Slippy Salmond and wee nippy tried to tell the Scottish public prior to independence ref 2014 that Oil was Scotland's saviour. Oil isn't  worth what you think it's worth, it certainly wouldn't make an independent Scotland rich.
5990 2018-11-23 19:45:48 I mix this hempz body oil with Argan oil, then throw in Shea butter before the wave grease.
5991 2018-11-23 19:45:43 i don't know who needs to hears this but leave some hair on it. you left puberty 20 years ago.
that's why there's coochie care product kits and extra virgin, cold pressed coconut oil...mosturize!
5992 2018-11-23 19:45:38 I work in the offshore and ship building industry. I know a bit about oil rig and offshore design. I know my tweet was a BIG oversimplification, but I do what I can with 280 characters. 
5993 2018-11-23 19:45:33 I sent you an article I had read and wondered if you had read it too. I don't believe immigration is a scary thought for our country and support it. But thank you for suggesting I'm part of the younger generation of Canadian's That Oil of Olay must be working
5994 2018-11-23 19:45:28 Bless this delicious beautiful food if only I could find a good greek pastry shop in Florida even good black beans and rice with seasoning cilantro olive oil hard to find in liberal democrat counties like Palm Beach
5995 2018-11-23 19:45:16 They don’t care. Climate change vs immediate financial gratification. The GOP is owned by the coal and oil barons who are busy destroying the planet, and care not a fig for us, the planet, our descendants, or even their own descendants.
5996 2018-11-23 19:45:15 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
5997 2018-11-23 19:45:14 FFS what next? If we leave the EU there'll be an olive oil drought! Nonsense scare tactics,if they stop providing goods and services to us,most EU countries will go bankrupt!
5998 2018-11-23 19:45:13 i heard if you cover the bad areas in coconut oil then soak in a hot bath it helps!!
5999 2018-11-23 19:45:07 Snake oil salesman @rogerkver #shame
6000 2018-11-23 19:44:57 The heart on fire with fresh oil overcomes the carnal mind everyday. That’s the definition of a disciple of Jesus Christ.
6001 2018-11-23 19:44:41 *He pours olive Oil all over the plate*
6002 2018-11-23 19:44:38 Sedihnya Hada Labo cleansing oil isnt suitable for my skin 
6003 2018-11-23 19:44:28 No it’s not the same as South America. What led to those socialist movements in south America were horrible conditions for the poor, like here. And we are not an economy with one product, oil, like Venezuela. The comparison doesn’t hold water.
6004 2018-11-23 19:44:27 Lol, the oil perfume I buy from someone can do that
6005 2018-11-23 19:44:21 This is not a result of incompetence.   It has been the plan all along ... Trudeau wants oil sands shut down and Alberta economy decimated.
6006 2018-11-23 19:44:14 Oil prices are again collapsing as the USA produced an average of 11.7 million barrels per day last week. What are the consequences for the fuel subsidy in T&T and the newly minted Heritage Petroleum?
6007 2018-11-23 19:44:11 Brent oil at new low of $58.4! 
Indian rupee shall strengthen further to 68 levels against USD, as Current Account Deficit (CAD) will decrease.
6008 2018-11-23 19:44:08 The Saudis and Wahhabis are persona non gratis to the world. Your talking about giving nuclear materials to a barbarian and his followers.  Let them use their oil for power, they have enough of it. Why give anything could destroy this planet? These people are the satanists.
6009 2018-11-23 19:44:03 Setting things on fire was the only thing I was good at in chemistry class. Who cares about the viscosity of oil and the make up of hydrocarbons when you can play ‘who can get the shortest sample stick without getting burnt?’
6010 2018-11-23 19:43:46 got too anxious to ask the oil guy to reset the boiler so now my mas pissed and i dunno how to fix anythin
6011 2018-11-23 19:43:41 How did we go from snake oil to snail oil?!
6012 2018-11-23 19:43:35 This province has so much potential but I can't help but feel like we're getting to the point where oil is exactly what's holding us back
6013 2018-11-23 19:43:34 It's green and comes from dirty oil, gas & coal! $$$
6014 2018-11-23 19:43:27 That's hilarious. How about some heroin? Hash oil? Cocaine?
6015 2018-11-23 19:43:20 Nah...No Black Friday deals on oil changes
6016 2018-11-23 19:42:59 So they got balck Friday deals on a oil change
6017 2018-11-23 19:42:49 The perfect end to my shift, a woman asks me “is there a taste of coconut off this?” while holding coconut oil in her hand. No love taste of Heinz baked beans off it now get out.
6018 2018-11-23 19:42:35 Ummm.... Logic. Just think about it for a second. Think about how long ago the glaciers have melted versus when man started drilling for oil.
6019 2018-11-23 19:42:32 So you gave them crust from the bread group, milk for dairy, eggs for protein, and if there was vegetable oil involved, you got two more groups covered. I'd say you're an awesome mom!!!!
6020 2018-11-23 19:42:31 Gas prices are coming down because of an oversupply of oil.  And they are continuing down due to 3-pipelines in the Permian Basis that are coming on-line that adds 2 million barrels per day in capacity to the U.S. capability.   As usual, you falsely claim you're responsible.
6021 2018-11-23 19:42:31 Pitch is this super dark oil that comes off of coal after it’s processed. :)
6022 2018-11-23 19:42:30 Nigeria: 80% of the nation's oil wealth is  owned by 1% of the population. #Nigeria #Africa #FridayFeeIing
6023 2018-11-23 19:42:19 There is no oil left. There is no oil left. Repeat, repeat and keep repeating until you are stupid enough to believe it. Alternatively open your eyes and ears and ask why you are being deceived
6024 2018-11-23 19:42:15 Pls @ShehuSani come to kamazo. Area need a transformer
6025 2018-11-23 19:42:10 Show out at Lucas Oil Stadium @7 tonight for state!!!
6026 2018-11-23 19:42:07 Majority of Americans disagree with you. He did not win the popular vote.Shame you don’t recognize psychopathy. Securing our future by pandering to autocrats, alienating allies, praising a royal family that kills Americans. You must be ready to sacrifice your life for Saudi oil.
6027 2018-11-23 19:42:07 Coconut oil?
6028 2018-11-23 19:41:46 the weird thing about tumblr compared to twitter is that while twitter tends to stick to the present and posts come in like, waves of topics, none of it really comes back unless its an old funny tweet like Oil.
i just saw an article posted on tumblr from 2015, still circulating
6029 2018-11-23 19:41:38 Expensive oil
6030 2018-11-23 19:41:30 do not allow Trump to make this about lower oil prices. Jamal Khashoggi was murdered, Trump is trying to squelch the story.  Its okay with him to sacrafice American lives so long as it profits him personally!!!
6031 2018-11-23 19:41:29 We must begin to visualize a new Nigeria without crude oil!@atiku plan, page 35. (I must to finish this) #letgetnigeriaworkingagain

6032 2018-11-23 19:41:19 In Zim fuel prices go up when oil price but rarely go down when oil price go down. Its only when you adjust for black market exchange rates
6033 2018-11-23 19:41:13 I don't remember twitting the hijab hindering anything.

6035 2018-11-23 19:41:04 They always tryna put this damn oil on ppl fuckin fingers
6036 2018-11-23 19:40:58 It's  important to know exactly what they said "no" to. I say "no" to Jerry Brown's Climate Change legislation, because it will enslave the average citizen while not even mentioning the frackers, oil drillers and Nestles! Legislation was approved for Calif in 2017 - & it sucks!!
6037 2018-11-23 19:40:57 Alas, there is no Hope for my Green Soul.  Long ago I made a pact with that damnable Fossil Fuels and now must suffer these freezing winter months surrounded by the Heat of my unholy oil furnace.  Pity me, O' Pity me dear Mother Earth!
6038 2018-11-23 19:40:56 Oil Margin Call
6039 2018-11-23 19:40:51 Oil line. That’ll end the tweeting, if he’s doing it.
6040 2018-11-23 19:40:44 You forgot to thank #Canada, who supplies 4x more oil than your murdering friends in SA. #DumbassWankMAGAt
6041 2018-11-23 19:40:43 เป็นหวัดงอมแงมเลยเรา เหมือนเด็กน้อยเลยที่น้ำหมูกไหลตลอด หือ ไม่ชอบเลย ทำงานลำบาก
6042 2018-11-23 19:40:36 Oil ha una porzione di segnale su riscaldamento/raffreddamento economia globale ma c'è cosi tanto altro rumore, spesso dominante, che non mi pare il caso di usarlo come indicatore primario
6043 2018-11-23 19:40:36 ….but you do see the hilarious irony of all this miracle 40yr+ oil discovery in the context of 2014 reporting? We certainly do!
6044 2018-11-23 19:40:35 Good Afternoon "Oil Tot". The 18 hours later edition! 
6045 2018-11-23 19:40:34 How have I been surviving months without coconut oil? my scalp is so thankful right now
6046 2018-11-23 19:40:27 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
6047 2018-11-23 19:40:25 Exactly the arguments around oil are an obsession with business as usual and continuing as normal, we need to show how things could be done differently and better
6048 2018-11-23 19:40:23 In the first case the #oil price doubled in a few hours; in the second it halved.
6049 2018-11-23 19:40:21 and funny thing?   Isn't our cost of living dependent upon oil / gas prices?    Let's see how this effects next year.
6050 2018-11-23 19:40:15 Yep, a trading block of Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland , Greenland, Denmark and Ireland. Plenty fish and oil

6053 2018-11-23 19:39:47 Dry cargo brother not wet cargo ie oil. But will ask from few pals for you on Monday.
6054 2018-11-23 19:39:39 Where is the oil rich Arab countries action to rescue fellow Muslims and Arabs? Non Muslim's in those countries, even after working for 20-25  years, expats have to leave. They fear that their culture will be  destroyed by outsiders if offered permanent residency or citizenship.
6055 2018-11-23 19:39:39 WHAT GAY KISS? Oil Tot give me the gossip please. Whose kissing who and where?
6056 2018-11-23 19:39:16 Indeed ! That is why at a European level we have to think how to decarbonise Europe. @Energy4Europe @MAC_europa @pierremoscovici What can we put in place to help financing #lowcarbon such as #nuclear, #solar or #hydro instead of #coal, #oil and #gas ? European solidarity ?
6057 2018-11-23 19:39:15 @AYELEANDCO did y’all recently  add tea tree oil to the SSS ingredients or has it always been in it??
6058 2018-11-23 19:39:13 Apparently not even that can save me from oil 
6059 2018-11-23 19:39:11 A tiny number of scientists employed by the oil industry do dispute that humans are the primary cause. But nobody anymore disputes that it's happening, no. To stop it, we need to slow the buildup of carbon in the atmosphere. Either cut emissions, or remove carbon.
6060 2018-11-23 19:39:02 Whoever took my Mongongo Oil, I hope that when you apply it to your hair that it all falls off. Peace and blessings 
6061 2018-11-23 19:38:56 NO BLOOD FOR OIL!
6062 2018-11-23 19:38:56 US exporting 11mm barrels of oil.. prices dropping bigly is not so great anymore. Not to mention that the 2014 drop helped cause an earnings recession in the S&P 500.
6063 2018-11-23 19:38:50 Lol most of them buy their kits and camou
6064 2018-11-23 19:38:47 Was it because you weren't prepared? Hakuna Matata Oil Tot. Let that be your problem free philosophy when your not prepared next time. Just in case.
6065 2018-11-23 19:38:46 I see even the Brent Crude Oil is responding well this #BlackFriday , just wonder if the taxis would follow suit

6069 2018-11-23 19:38:29 I heat with oil in the Catskills. Happy holidays Marco. You're one of the best.
6070 2018-11-23 19:38:09 Even the guns they are using is outdated, no bullet proof vest for soldiers some of the soldiers are using slippers to fight. No motivation its just sad.
6071 2018-11-23 19:37:58 BP begins pumping MILLIONS of barrels of oil in MAJOR UK find http:// So why the hell is it so dear to buy fuel ?? Rip off again ?
6072 2018-11-23 19:37:58 Now, how did YOU achieve that, huh, getting “gas prices so low”??? Did you and Kushner broker a deal with the Saudis, I.e., you provide cover on the Khashoggi assassination in exchange for OPEC lowering price on a barrel of oil? Quid pro quo = blood for money?

6074 2018-11-23 19:37:45 Cut down caffeine, Consume plenty of water, apply peppermint oil on forehead, eat almonds,eggs,oatmeal, peanut butter. Yoga is another option available.
6075 2018-11-23 19:37:34 Time to put all this enthusiasm into something else. Canadians are trying to get off gas oil and coal.
6076 2018-11-23 19:37:25 So why didn’t they wait in the shadows until the vandals showed up an do a little vandalism on their cowardly butts? A few strained limbs, broken eyeglasses, spray paint their faces and hair with oil based yellow and tie wrap their wrists to their ankles and leave them there!
6077 2018-11-23 19:37:23 Call it common courtesy, diplomacy, or simply basic communication to come to terms. Nothing spells doom and gloom like the oil spills lingering off every shore, or near most every pipeline. Nobody is saying we should not prosper, but we do need to update our infrastructure.
6078 2018-11-23 19:37:19 It doesn't matter to Eastern Canadians either.The majority will vote Liberal. They are burning Saudi oil right now and quite happy doing it.Time for Westerners to wake up and fight for our future w/o the Eastern Cartel.
6079 2018-11-23 19:37:09 You should have to make sure that the money is judiciously spent rather than denied the opportunity.
6080 2018-11-23 19:37:08 My best friend owns an oil company, he said years ago, north sea  full, only thing required at that time was the technology required to get it out and that there is more MUCH more off the west coast that we cannot access because of the nuclear sub bases.
6081 2018-11-23 19:37:07 Why are declining oil prices bad for the stock market when its good for consumers! Don't all companies that they are invested in use energy! So wouldn't lower energy costs translate to more profits for investors! DUH!
6082 2018-11-23 19:37:06 Why don't u challenge Th criminal US claim instead of echoing it ? Shipping oil to Syria but happens because USA is illicitly occupying eastern Syria and illicitly killing Syrians @HadiNasrallah @HKX07 @Partisangirl @2ndNewMoon @KevorkAlmassian
6083 2018-11-23 19:37:03 3/ Hard time for Unicorns...

To know, we have to wait a slump  :

- Certainly, part of 2018 rally on US equities and oil prices were justified by both stronger fundamentals, lower equity risk premia, higher geopolitical risk premia, blabla...
- But then came the slump of Octobe
6084 2018-11-23 19:36:59 Donald Trump and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are doing everything they can to open even more of our public lands and waters -- wild places that belong to you and me -- for the oil and gas industry to destroy. @foe_us
6085 2018-11-23 19:36:58 Liberal states like New York, Illinois,  New Mexico, Colorado, and California want everyone else to cut fossil fuel production but refuse to cut their crude oil production. HYPOCRITES!

6088 2018-11-23 19:36:36 Atta girl!!! Go Oil and go Redblacks!!!
6089 2018-11-23 19:36:32 Agree. We should be making the arguments about thriving without oil. The talisman of oil lets the ant-independents set the agenda.
6090 2018-11-23 19:36:30 Can you clarify if you are just speaking about oil, more specifically cdn oil? What about diversified mining companies?
6091 2018-11-23 19:36:27 @SethAbramson hey, Seth. I was wondering, have you looked at the 8 companies DT formed in Saudi Arabia in Aug 2015? Why 8? Do you think it may be to split a large commission from a famous oil deal into smaller payments? Did MBS bagman the cut for DT after the Rosneft sale?
6092 2018-11-23 19:36:24 Who ever ask the LibTards  to BUY Transmountain, all the oil industry wanted was a permit to spend private $$$ to expand and double its capacity.... its TRUDEAU’s MORONS who decided to VIRTUUE SIGNAL and waste Billion of $$$ and purchase the pipeline!!!
6093 2018-11-23 19:36:18 Just think, if trump had been prez on 9/12/2001 telling America thru a blow horn not what Prez Bush said but defended the country responsible for falling the Twin Towers cuz we get oil from them. Thats exactly what he’s done. Or imagine we did the same for Pearl Harbor 
6094 2018-11-23 19:36:14 lol ok
6095 2018-11-23 19:36:14 When has any of this made sense? When has trusting politicians made sense? People falling for the same snake oil patois year on year
6096 2018-11-23 19:36:07 Energy East was a part of the long term solution.
The Trudeau government missed the opportunity to live without oil imports & free ourselves from discounts on our oil exports to the omnivorous US.@OilsandsAction
6097 2018-11-23 19:35:51 It’ll be rough going but I’m reading as much as I can helpful hints. Like putting peppermint oil in my diffusers and drinking peppermint tea.

6100 2018-11-23 19:35:25 US oil prices plummeted as much as 7% and sank deeper into a bear market that has alarmed investors and made drivers around the world happy.  F U Big Oil
6101 2018-11-23 19:35:24 You know that the glaciers melted way before oil companies existed, and temperatures were rising at pretty much the same rate?
6102 2018-11-23 19:35:15 The united states now produces more oil than any other country. Opec isn't what it used to be. We get 40 % from canada, 8 % from mexico. Your argument is just that.

6108 2018-11-23 19:34:47 It's not clear to me if we even use much oil from them.  In the Obama years we cut our dependency on foreign oil substantially; our own refineries are producing much more of what we use now.

6114 2018-11-23 19:34:35 We've got oil and we've no got oil!!??!!
Personally I couldn't give two rats farts aboot it. Other countries have gained independence and thrived without it.
Let's jist get oot.
6115 2018-11-23 19:34:34 I have great sympathy and compassion, but, this would be like loaning a dope starved family member money. 
More noble to focus on the many than the few, enticing more to come is not a good thing.

6116 2018-11-23 19:34:30 Things Trudeau sees as a priority instead of Alberta oil.

Global warming

Dairy cartel
The U.N
CNN interviews

Care to add to the list :D
6117 2018-11-23 19:34:24 Now it is a great time for those with oil & gas portfolios to implement some repair strategies. Sitting looking at your screen like a deer in the headlights is not a prudent course of action.
6118 2018-11-23 19:34:19 Your point pls
6119 2018-11-23 19:34:05 When you fire two rounds it jam, they didn't use all those expensive tanks they were showcasing in Phyton and cobra dance or sharan daji or Duran mikiya ops, but delicate part of prosecution of war you're using degraded tanks
6120 2018-11-23 19:34:00 Rio Arriba County receives vital education funding from the oil and natural gas industry! 

That funding could buy approximately 224,914 textbooks! 
Or that funding could buy approximately 143 school buses! 
Or it could pay for 319 classroom teachers’ salaries!

6124 2018-11-23 19:33:48 Trudeau again forgets ALBERTA! This smug POS comes to Calgary and snubbed his nose at Alberta Oil. Speaking of oil I’m sure Justin knows what a dipstick is!
6125 2018-11-23 19:33:46 Trudeau admits that the price of Canadian oil might just be in crisis mode

WHO WOULDA FUCKIN GUESSED?!?!?!
6126 2018-11-23 19:33:44 Saudi Arabia supplies 11% of our oil. They recently tried to drive prices up. You should be thanking Canada (which you insult constantly). They provide 40%. Why don't you ever know anything?

6129 2018-11-23 19:33:30 Safer if the US walked in and took all the oil. We wouldn’t have to put up with this comical political dance

6131 2018-11-23 19:33:28 Should parliament be arguing about gender imbalances and allowances or about ficticious oil spills right now?..

Let's get real folks.
6132 2018-11-23 19:33:20 Who didn't see the oil shortage coming
6133 2018-11-23 19:33:04 South Africa have $1 billion to invest in South Sudan’s oil sector while our own people live in shacks.
6134 2018-11-23 19:33:00 Saudi Arabia has provided more resources towards terrorism than any other country in the ME.  To keep good ties with the Saudis just for the sake of arms deals and oil reveals what our national character at the upper levels is to the rest of the world. Trump does not stand alone.
6135 2018-11-23 19:32:51 a) not at all covered in this story, or most stories like it, which is exactly the point 
b) would be amused to hear your theory about @bellacaledonia’s ulterior motive in bringing up Climate Breakdown in the context of oil extraction
6136 2018-11-23 19:32:48 Any chance oil is bottoming leading to snap back of xop/xle calls?
6137 2018-11-23 19:32:44 Let's get off of oil, as quickly as possible.
6138 2018-11-23 19:32:36 AN OIL LINE?? Is he related to Onassis?
6139 2018-11-23 19:32:33 Just a heads up to everyone being paid to spread FUD by the Koch Bros. Your weekly check might be delayed this week due to the recent crash in oil prices. The Koch Bros say to keep up the good work and they’ll pay you back when oil goes back up.

6141 2018-11-23 19:32:29 Tech. The difference is Tech was selling fantasy solutions, to fantasy problems. Oil is still in enormous demand. For sell trajectory, it requires a return to 2015 production narrative, 2008 demand destruction, with peak demand at 2025. The pessimist trinity is being priced in.
6142 2018-11-23 19:32:26 what this mean for oil?
6143 2018-11-23 19:32:25 Anyone notice that Trump’s sanctions are all against oil producing countries? Hmmm. How does that #MAGA ? It certainly makes oil companies richer...

6154 2018-11-23 19:30:40 What if we reach peak oil sooner than expected and aircraft fuel becomes so expensive that the commercial airline industry shuts down and the resulting ripple effect on the economy pushes us back into the dark ages I mean is there a backup plan or what???
6155 2018-11-23 19:30:38 Who’s asking you to give up cars ac etc? Bullshit. We’re asking to cut back on environment-destroying ways to do it. You’d find problems with solar, wind, electric cars. Conservative my ass. Owned by big oil is more like it. Amazing how much you don’t know about the ‘left’.

6158 2018-11-23 19:30:27 Iran & Russia would harvest greatly from our departure from Saudi Arabia. Iran would gain strength in their goal to destroy us, Russia would gain economic wealth to develop a great military and supply weapons to a new enemy Saudi Arabia. The oil isn’t the issue, the security is!
6159 2018-11-23 19:30:27 Unreal. You refuse common ground like oil to water. It’s never ending insults. Are you that much better than me that you can’t cede any point? Btw, the point of TR quote about “politics” was for its implication about discourse, not the literal meaning of “politics”, come on.
6160 2018-11-23 19:30:27 This is only some Amarican funded guys opinion.
CCPA is paid to oppose all Canadian oil and gas projects that are meant for tidewater.
6161 2018-11-23 19:30:26 Well, start by putting forth legislation, (that would be a first for you.) Next, lead by example. Turn off the gas, electricity that is produced w/nasty fossil fuels, fuel oil for heat and go 100% solar heat.

6170 2018-11-23 19:29:40 Judging by a lot of your posts you have a real hatred for Alberta and the oil industry in Alberta. It is this type of internal divisiveness that requires us to support the oil industry in “Sick” country’s like SA
6171 2018-11-23 19:29:37 Yes it is. I like it though,raw, or just passed through some steam 1-2 seconds. Never tried chilli oil though so I’ll give it a go.
6172 2018-11-23 19:29:32 This is what I'm banking in. They may find they need someone to Oil nuts and the like.
6173 2018-11-23 19:28:55 The price of oil tanked about five minutes ago and your all crying broke?

6176 2018-11-23 19:28:49 And now oil is down 7+% today
6177 2018-11-23 19:28:42 We’re not because both dems & gop don’t care about khashoggi. They can use him for lower oil prices now. The left will still use the story against trump though.

6197 2018-11-23 19:27:00 Maybe it does now. Back in 2010, the last time we were there, it didn’t. I’ve heard it’s grown with the oil boom!

6212 2018-11-23 19:25:52 Sources of U.S. Oil:

- Saudi Arabia (11%) - Trump 'stands with them' after murder.
- Venezuela (9%) - Trump insults their govn't.
- Mexico (8%) - Trump calls them 'bad hombres'.

What is Saudi Arabia paying Trump?
6213 2018-11-23 19:25:43 #OOTT US oil rig count always reacts with a 4-5 months lag to big crude price moves, specially downward. So, if we bottom not too far from here, it goes from c. 900 now to 600 by April/May... and US production growth will decelerate massively from that point

6230 2018-11-23 19:24:19 Fuck all to do with us!
Maybe suspend buying their oil would be a start
6231 2018-11-23 19:24:18 My sister asked if i ever considered selling my DIY face oil. Then it dawned on me that she’s been dipping in my shit. 
6232 2018-11-23 19:24:17 It’s sad that people keep quite just because of the oil I suppose. Wrong is wrong and it must be condemned and not sugar coated
6233 2018-11-23 19:24:10 #3

4. Recent Crude oil collapse is the only reason our stocks aren't absolutely flying. Prior to the ver recent decrease crude has performed quite well for almost 3 years. U stocks went down during that rise.
6234 2018-11-23 19:24:05 I think I hit that a few times. I had several blankets and a dog to keep me warm at the time though. That was the winter in VA that I thought I was out of heating oil. To fill it was 400 bucks.
6235 2018-11-23 19:24:02 So lower oil prices in the 30s hurt our industry in 2016 and DT is rushing towards another round. This will be as bad as soybean tariff to Americans.  May be a good thing for alternative energy, even with subsidies squeezed.
6236 2018-11-23 19:23:52 1/2:#POTUS putting #US on dangerous isolationists’ path where we will have no trading partners, people in our own country won’t afford goods made here, oil will be in such over abundance that prices will drop causing #US shale biz to dry up, economy will slow, tariffs will choke
6237 2018-11-23 19:23:39 Watty, you overlook the fact that the Trudeau government took the bold step of buying the Trans Mountain pipeline to ensure expansion completion, so that oil can reach export markets. There will be a profit at re-sale. Pipelines will transport other products when oil is obsolete.
6238 2018-11-23 19:23:35 How's the oil spill going out on the east coast?    Or don't you know about that?
6239 2018-11-23 19:23:35 No carbon taxes anywhere till Canada sees new pipelines and oil flowing at sane prices to international markets.
6240 2018-11-23 19:23:31 I’m covered in motor oil, axle grease, and paint. 

The line forms to the right.
6241 2018-11-23 19:23:30 Guy oil slow nawe 
6242 2018-11-23 19:23:26 Aziz bet Konyaspor with his house. Match-fixer ffs.

6245 2018-11-23 19:23:05 Just called lucas oil and they said tickets $15 lmao
6246 2018-11-23 19:23:01 Before you criticize our Minister, please read about how the different policies work in Canada. Emission leakage has always been an issue when implementing any such policy. The government has set a standard for different oil companies and provide incentives to REDUCE emissions.
6247 2018-11-23 19:23:00 When oil prices are too low Texas suffers job losses.  We need the price to be around $80 so everyone prospers. Don’t forget that Mr. President!!  Balance plz!
6248 2018-11-23 19:22:58 For makeup removal you should try DHC cleansing oil if you haven’t! I like it more than bioderma but you have to double cleanse. Gets rid of all my makeup!
6249 2018-11-23 19:22:44 @tdichristopher you little snowflake...all of sudden you're concerned with the oil industry in the US??? Gimme a break!
6250 2018-11-23 19:22:37 Had the most disgusting oil earlier . Ke kgeba yona fela .
6251 2018-11-23 19:22:30 What is good for the ...is good for the maigero community in Kaduna tooo
6252 2018-11-23 19:22:23 P.S.  sorry about all the oil on the ground but if you had been ready on time
6253 2018-11-23 19:21:55 If your gonna invest in oil do that shit rnrn.
6254 2018-11-23 19:21:51 Trump continues to support cutting up a journalist so that Saudi Arabia will continue cutting oil prices.
6255 2018-11-23 19:21:47 You might be in a house full of black girls if there’s coconut oil on the bathroom handle 
6256 2018-11-23 19:21:46 Because in Canada we are plain stupid.  We are in Debt to our eye balls and we take a discount on our oil to a tune of $80 Million a DAY.  We would be a self sufficient energy country with pipelines and DEBT FREE you stupid Politicians.
6257 2018-11-23 19:21:23 @ABDanielleSmith The reality is that AB's oil isn't ethical. Minerals are claimed via doctrine of discovery (Royal charter). FN's are living in poverty while the settlers funnel the wealth of the Crown through Treaties which where broken at every turn.
6258 2018-11-23 19:21:20 I understand the work showing negative oil price shocks are about net neutral given investment pullbacks. But I think the Fed’s imperfect reaction function & our current place in the business cycle make this a big net plus right now
6259 2018-11-23 19:21:14 I’m getting an oil change and tire rotation to celebrate Black Friday. So, obviously, it’s lit.
6260 2018-11-23 19:21:06 @JohnKasich your interview with CNN about #KhashoggiMurder was very inspiring, but as ME who had been in solidarity cell during green movement, human right activist in ME do not look/inspire from US. For us, uncle sum washes our blood from his hand with oil, and GOP is the worst
6261 2018-11-23 19:20:57 no  it failed on fate number's day so now im heating up my oil to fry his chicken
6262 2018-11-23 19:20:56 Money managers have cut their bullish ICE Brent crude oil bets by 32,263 net-long positions to 182,569, weekly ICE Futures Europe data on futures and options show.
The net-long position was the least bullish in about three years

BBG #OOTT
6263 2018-11-23 19:20:54 one of the reasons to confirm the colossal failure of government's privatization of the power sector!
6264 2018-11-23 19:20:50 oil peaked the day Khashoggi died, every day there is incriminating news for MBS, oil tanks huge.  how is there not a connection?
6265 2018-11-23 19:20:42 Lots of Hitch fans in the gambling community. The opener in the Oil/Ducks game has been blown to bits. Oilers opened -100 and are now -126
6266 2018-11-23 19:20:30 If ur in Albany still, Ford on Ledo is open and does oil changes
6267 2018-11-23 19:20:30 Careful of hot oil splatters
6268 2018-11-23 19:20:24 My fellow Albertans, @RachelNotley is not working hard enough to get our oil to alternative markets. She is not fighting with #Trudeau & his #Liberal Gov. ALL Trudeau & #Notley do is talk.  Notley needs to do more!  Legislate pipeline approvals or Shut in wells. Pick a fight!
6269 2018-11-23 19:20:22 Good for non oil producers like Zim. I hope fuel prices in Zim will also go down
6270 2018-11-23 19:20:21 First one is a savings of 17 trolling based on what we spends now. The second is findable easily if we stop subsidizing oil companies and continue war. Please tell us how point three works exactly. Provide proof for your numbers.
6271 2018-11-23 19:20:20 Lol yep BDI=star bright and feck got his tip from him
6272 2018-11-23 19:20:15 He was broke. That's why he won't release his tax returns. He used his snake oil salesman techniques to dupe the American people to give him all their money. #trumpponzischeme
6273 2018-11-23 19:20:15 Supporting the DNC because they oppose Trump is like supporting Saudi Arabia because they keep oil prices down. They both kill journalists.
6274 2018-11-23 19:20:11 I am old enough to remember when Albertans were telling eastern Canada to "freeze in the dark" after Trudeau's father negotiated the oil deal with Alberta years ago. Not a lot of sympathy from me for their plight.
6275 2018-11-23 19:20:06 "Bart, I'm going to make you drink every one of these oil barrels just to teach you a lesson..."
6276 2018-11-23 19:20:06 Where do you get that timeline from, exactly? Because KSA's US bound exports have been declining every week since the Khashoggi news broke.

Oil transport over oceans takes time, it's not immediate.
6277 2018-11-23 19:19:56 Well, the Oil Refineries section of Shadow of the Tomb Raider is absolutely badass.
6278 2018-11-23 19:19:49 Answer me this world, if the largest oil deposits are in the middle-east, why haven’t we found more dinosaurs there? Don’t tell me political restrictions oh help me God.
6279 2018-11-23 19:19:47 I’m hopeless with makeup, but I’m AAAALLL about face products, if that counts? Herbivore is keeping me alive with their Lapis facial oil and Pink Cloud face cream. I also just ordered myself a six-pack of Fresh Sugar lip treatments in a myriad of sexy ass colours
6280 2018-11-23 19:19:43 Someone will die 
B\C money is more important than climate and oil and human life
6281 2018-11-23 19:19:40 jaahil bhakt ho kya crude oil pata hai kitna gir Gaya hai is month ....85$ se  60 $ ke neechay ho Gaya hai ..aur petrol price Abhi bhi ₹75 per litre hai ye kaunsa free pricing ka formula hai girta paise mein hai aur upar jata rupya mein hai
6282 2018-11-23 19:19:27 I hope they hear it for the Crazy Town speak that it is. Phantom invading Caravans, phony oil price numbers, and telling everyone not to worry about the troops and how they spend their Thanksgiving. They need you see this for what it is. Propaganda.
6283 2018-11-23 19:19:25 I’m eating veggies but they’re covered in oil and cheese 
6284 2018-11-23 19:19:24 Yup but we have to save the Wales as well. Which was based on fish oil WD40 or CRC?
6285 2018-11-23 19:19:21 And it already has. Oil refiners/rigs destroyed. Supply lines disrupted. Billions in destroyed and damaged communities/businesses. Floods, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes - it’s hard to avoid these even in their guilded towers. Even with all this, they stand with fingers in ears.
6286 2018-11-23 19:19:17 처음엔 호기심이였다로 시작한 짝록으로 후기엔 고록입니다 쓰기
6287 2018-11-23 19:19:15 @chigrl do you have a working hypo with oil right now? It is just taking a beating...
6288 2018-11-23 19:19:07 Lol. I know a lot of oil is produced in Alberta. I’m from SK. I have several family members that work in N. Alberta in the oil industry.  Doesn’t change the fact that governments don’t buy oil. Try spell check next time!
6289 2018-11-23 19:19:00 o vocalista do midnight oil tava male

6291 2018-11-23 19:18:57 The breaking news is related to the biggest Peak Oil contrarian, Dr. Jerome Corsi, getting busted for Trump-related crimes.  Corsi is renowned for writing books claiming that the world held an infinite supply of crude oil.
6292 2018-11-23 19:18:54 Uma tal de Crefisa que já operava no mercado, além das faculdades das américas. Essa Black Star Oil Co. está muito enrustida.
Confio na presença, olho no olho. Papel aceita tudo, ainda mais em véspera de eleição.
6293 2018-11-23 19:18:39 Its also about the bond markets.
The Saudis, by agreement, by bonds with oil money.
6294 2018-11-23 19:18:39 I really want to try and work with some oil paint can anyone recommend me a good oil paint brand that isn't to expensive
6295 2018-11-23 19:18:39 Case in point, 80% of Nigeria's oil wealth is owned by 1% of the population. #Nigeria #Africa @isreview @naijamarxists
6296 2018-11-23 19:18:34 You know oil companies that want to deny climate change give money to politicians????
6297 2018-11-23 19:18:30 I’m at Sephora right now and I just wanted to see how much a serum of there’s was.... y’all $50 for a lil 1 oz serum that literally only has argan oil in it, I got one with argan, rosehip AND evening primrose and it’s only $18

Y’all letting Sephora rob y’all lol, shop with me
6298 2018-11-23 19:18:28 That comment is officially the dumbest ever on Twitter. BTW... per previous conversation.. Oil stocks are awesome. Haliburton too
6299 2018-11-23 19:18:22 Israel's bottle of oil, poor incense holder CD, and my presidential pick
6300 2018-11-23 19:18:22 Ok so I just put coconut oil on my hair, as like a mask thing mixed with some coconut oil hair treatment thing - I shall report back as to how it goes 
6301 2018-11-23 19:18:21 Bloody hell, these Persian Gulf countries are behaving badly, clearly corrupted by oil money for way too long! #arabianjustice
6302 2018-11-23 19:18:06 I'm eating pasta with a bunch of olive oil and by god this is a lot of olive oil.
6303 2018-11-23 19:17:54 Did You Know? #US has no reason whatsoever to import oil from other countries. America land possesses enough oil to never need import it.
6304 2018-11-23 19:17:49 ugh. my position is 70% USD cash, 30% short oil. That's it
6305 2018-11-23 19:17:46 Home at last after an eventful day! Had an appmnt at Broadford osp so thought I would take my car to the garage there as I'd seen a wee oil leak. Took Eilidh with me for a nice walk. All OK until I was told you can't drive that car anywhere!
6306 2018-11-23 19:17:40 I thought we were told it was running out there was no more oil in scotland. That is some advancement the industry has made in 3 years....genuinely do not know how you guys can sleep with the lies you spout daily
6307 2018-11-23 19:17:27 get some oil, get some styling cream, get you a trimmer. ain't nobodys beard look good au naturale
6308 2018-11-23 19:17:22 Plastic is a byproduct of refining oil that people like the Koch bros have turned into yet another profit centre. Want to end to plastic pollution? Stop refining oil. As for cleaning up plastic pollution, that may be harder than putting genies back in bottles. #KeepItInTheGround
6309 2018-11-23 19:17:18 I oil my hair daily
6310 2018-11-23 19:17:16 And Canada? Oh, we still buy their oil and more. Money talks!
6311 2018-11-23 19:17:05 Resources to sustain a world at minimal standards is an unwinnable Fibonacci sequence. SJ theory will not permit this " radical" idea to be taught.
6312 2018-11-23 19:17:03 Maybe some coconut oil? You can mix it with an essential oil for added relief/ taking away from the coconut smell 
6313 2018-11-23 19:17:00 Today's been pretty successful.

 New gaming computer parts have been ordered
 Selling the iPad (no, not in trade for the tattoo)
 Oil changed in the car (WITH NO WAIT)

6317 2018-11-23 19:16:43 I am appalled that I have had to take donations from the UK and Ireland proper to fund Education for Palestinian children. Regev is a snake oil salesman.
6318 2018-11-23 19:16:42 Whatever is said about the price of oil, the currency, Europe & the Euro, voting YES for independence means the Scottish government has control of all of these things, not the govt of our neighbouring country. 
The future may be uncertain, but I'd rather choose my own #indyref2
6319 2018-11-23 19:16:34 Allah ya kara daukaka
6320 2018-11-23 19:16:29 Who knows how to change oil???? I’ll literally pay you
6321 2018-11-23 19:16:27 @TheCurrentCBC today’s piece on #tarsands prices was a WTF moment. You couldn’t talk to 1 person OUTSIDE the oil industry? Calling the #WCS price a “discount” against #WTI is like saying oxtails are discounted versus filet mignon. It’s garbage & few want it. 1/
6322 2018-11-23 19:16:21 차였어(?
6323 2018-11-23 19:16:12 It’s really fitting you have a dinosaur like Rex lobbying for oil.
6324 2018-11-23 19:16:10 How does it compare to Saudi Arabia’s or any of the other countries ocean protection plans you are supporting by doing everything you can you landlock CDN oil?
6325 2018-11-23 19:16:10 As a net importer of oil It’s actually better for the uk economy for oil prices to be low. Rather Than having higher North Sea oil tax revenues.
6326 2018-11-23 19:16:02 How thick is the earth? I'm worried for the guys who drill for oil.
6327 2018-11-23 19:16:00 Thanks, it’s oil, ash and lavender. It was painted over several months by layering and then scraping away, then adding layers again.
6328 2018-11-23 19:15:56 @RT_Erdogan olive oil deal archentina rains crashed currency 2006

6334 2018-11-23 19:15:32 Think about the fact that Beto is in Texas and these numbers are not from the corporations but from individuals who work in the industry. Since a lot of people work in the oil industry in TX, any politician there will receive money from ppl who work in that industry.
6335 2018-11-23 19:15:27 They were soooo good!!!  With lots of garlic and oil on them too  A must visit in Malaga for sure 
6336 2018-11-23 19:15:23 Everyone's playing PokeOil, these secret oil reservoirs keep popping up.
6337 2018-11-23 19:15:18 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
6338 2018-11-23 19:15:18 And I know that but then someone came in and decided to slam Albertans. There's an irony to complaining about AB oil over the computer. Don't you think?
6339 2018-11-23 19:15:16 When your product is good and the company has full confidence in its success, they don't need to spend AS MUCH on advertisement. When you're spending more than oil-and-soap companies to sell a supposed superstar, you've got to question their confidence in that superstar.
6340 2018-11-23 19:15:05 Naugh...you barely have any laundry but the baby oil might kick my ass at the checkout line...
6341 2018-11-23 19:15:04 On this same day, it appears that Trump-related indictments in the USA are coming down on perhaps the primary oil contrarian, Dr. Jerome Corsi, who claimed in his books that the world held an infinite supply of oil.  The contrarian is a political animal.
6342 2018-11-23 19:15:02 Try the organic ones in olive oil. Surprisingly, they are good.
6343 2018-11-23 19:14:50 Energy makes that possible. In order for 3/4 of the worlds population to have even a little better of a life the world needs 100,000,000 bl of oil a day just to live in the standard of Mexico.
In Canada each citizen on average uses 60+ bbl of oil PER year. Double the world avg
6344 2018-11-23 19:14:43 To curb immigration you need to stop selling weapons & manipulation. Creating wars everywhere and avoiding the outcome is hypocracy. Stop funding rogue regimes and creating militias to usurpe raw materials and tap illegal oil. It is cause and effect so check the cause be4 effect
6345 2018-11-23 19:14:41 I thinking years ago of getting a job on a North Sea oil rig. If it pays me good wage, yeah!
6346 2018-11-23 19:14:39 Well, at least for once the gov't isn't trying to hide the fact that's its all about oil and weapons money. So I guess... "hooray for that?"  Are the mobsters finally wising us up?
6347 2018-11-23 19:14:24 You condoned the murder of an American citizen because you believe lower oil prices is more important than the lives of the people you have sworn to protect.  You are the worst person to represent our country.  Your black heart is unamerican.
6348 2018-11-23 19:14:15 I agree with that and if anyone wants to work WITH Albertans on finding solutions, then let's do that. I find it rude, though, that someone who depends on AB oil then turns around and slaps ABans for being bad people. There's an irony here that no one sees.
6349 2018-11-23 19:14:13 That’s good news, are you palm oil free?
6350 2018-11-23 19:14:09 ...vinegar, half water for the glass, and citrus oil for the metal rims. Even Grandma will be proud! #tips #cleaning #stain #DIY #shower #repair #damage #home #residential #glass #Tahlequah #OK #NortheasternGlass
6351 2018-11-23 19:14:09 and scraping the iran deal actually raised oil prices, they are only coming down because of slowed down demand in recent months. So, why don't you try again? he has done nothing that wasn't already within the trends of the economy.
6352 2018-11-23 19:14:07 The recent slump in crude prices has come close to closing the gap in performance of oil stocks and the Lion King.…
6353 2018-11-23 19:14:02 @thespybrief thoughts on Saudi and oil price dropping? Gonna drive the Russians nuts!!!
6354 2018-11-23 19:14:00 Let them fry themselves in their own oil. Lol
6355 2018-11-23 19:14:00 Oh, they do plenty, but it's all to help the Saudis in the war. The USA have always supported their oil rich ally. Can't imagine why...
6356 2018-11-23 19:13:57 jules’ fav food: chicken fingers
bruce’s fav food: pizelles
 what they actually get to eat and love as a treat: coconut oil
6357 2018-11-23 19:13:54 Trump put pressure on Saudis and oil goes bellow USD $ 60. Will it remains?
6358 2018-11-23 19:13:51 Free oil changes at my job today and tomorrow slide
6359 2018-11-23 19:13:50 Praise KSA and screw the American oil industry. Totally a wining strategy.
6360 2018-11-23 19:13:43 The tea tree oil foot soak?
6361 2018-11-23 19:13:39 Saudi got Khasoggi executed. Trump used the ensuing global outrage as leverage to badger them into keeping output up, while slowing growth weighs on demand.

6369 2018-11-23 19:13:12 Mike Matheny and player development go together like water and oil. Good job, @Royals.
6370 2018-11-23 19:13:12 Vascepa had about 32% of the fish oil market for last quarter at $55M. It is about $220M for a year. Vascepa should be able to grap 70% of that market, which translates into $500M a year. Now, the Reduce-it trial just increases the fish oil market by a factor of 10.
6371 2018-11-23 19:13:12 “People assume that without reams of regulatory codes people will freely be selling snake oil and defective products, but actually our common law courts are adequately equipped to deter companies from false advertising or selling faulty products already.” Anthony Sammeroff
6372 2018-11-23 19:12:58 #Pakistan is the only country where Selected PM has increased the burden on  citizens although there is a drop in intl oil prices.
6373 2018-11-23 19:12:49 Yeah it is long past time we did that but only Indy will make that poss. We need to get out of union before WM squander that oil like they have wi all the rest. Saor Alba 
6374 2018-11-23 19:12:48 That's not how it works. The Saudi gvmt is suffering in a way bc they're now making less oil $ but the prices will soon go up bc they've cut the supply.
6375 2018-11-23 19:12:43 You want me to go wild on #BlackFriday?
Give me deep discounts on allergy meds, dishwasher detergent, & olive oil and I'm there.
6376 2018-11-23 19:12:32 No I want someone to invent an alternative to oil.
6377 2018-11-23 19:12:27 Don’t let it get to low it will kill the oil jobs in Louisiana for sure with out oil jobs it’s the same as killing, coal ,steel
6378 2018-11-23 19:12:17 The more relevant point is that we will be living with coal, oil & natural gas for another 100-200 years before clean energy is profitable, widespread in availability and integrated into the power grid.  No amount of political pressure or money is going to change that.
6379 2018-11-23 19:12:14 #UJO My first ever purchase of Union Jack Oil was 2014 its been a long ride of ups and downs and disheartening planning meetings. That said, there's been absolute monumental moves on Britain's biggest onshore assets.

6389 2018-11-23 19:11:29 Douglas Fraser is a twat.  Knows nothing about oil price volatility and how that is completely unconnected to the value of oil. If the fucker had even the slightest qualification to speak on the subject with any authourity, then I might be inclined to listen..... He doesn't.
6390 2018-11-23 19:11:28 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
6391 2018-11-23 19:11:27 I need a man... I was rubbing oil on my scalp and I moaned 
6392 2018-11-23 19:11:17 Americans unlike Chinese/Russians take the short view, next Q, yr at most , but many just here and now. There is no general conception of 5, 10, 20 yr or beyond plans. 
One reason Americans dont save when times are good. China will be hegemonic matter of time
6393 2018-11-23 19:11:15 There could be a strategic component to the decision as well, imagine if war disrupts oil supply.
6394 2018-11-23 19:11:13 Saudi Arabia's oil supply will dry up by mid-century, which means consumption based economies, such as China and the EU, will turn to Iran & Russia for their oil. This will force Wall Street to change its investment strategy & the US gov't to adopt a new foreign policy.

6397 2018-11-23 19:11:07 1. We get over 9% if the oil from them, which is a LOT. Yes, they do control opec and oil prices significantly. 2. You do understand that the Iran deal merely postponed their nuclear development, not stopped it. It was a politically driven deal which was short term focused.
6398 2018-11-23 19:11:06 Apparently, lower oil prices are now a net drag on U.S. economy, bcoz the (capital-expenditure) cutbacks triggered in the shale oil business outweigh the gains to consumers' spending from cheaper gas prices," (Ian Shepherdson, chief economist, Pantheon Macroecons) in Marketwatch
6399 2018-11-23 19:11:04 It's been this way for a while.  The drop in oil recently was caused by over caution among speculators concerned with re-introduction of Iran sanctions. When it became clear those concerns weren't valid, the price dropped back down.
6400 2018-11-23 19:11:01 Yeah...you've got to admit that those English Bastards were well smart back in 1707, they knew that Oil was there all right...

6415 2018-11-23 19:10:12 Totally agree also alternatives to palm oil are worse too, they need to plant it somewhere else. If everyone bycotts palm oil the situation will just get worse.
6416 2018-11-23 19:10:09 Look up "Jesus anointing oil recipe"...Weed is from God, your friends were not just on weed they mixed it with something I can pretty much guarantee. Also, a diff time period, that's when it was really being demonized and they began the programming minds. It's a very unique plant
6417 2018-11-23 19:10:06 what the charts tell me is natural price of oil is 25 and the explosion to 140 was orchestrated and it fell apart now we r rushing to 25 from 75

6422 2018-11-23 19:09:43 For as long as the US continues with its fracking, we have enough oil for the whole world and maybe for the other planets to use too.

6425 2018-11-23 19:09:25 Instead of everyone being soo bummed out, why dont we rather say thank you. We might not have been one of the lucky ones, but atleast someone else got something whether it was needed or not. Luck & fast fingers was on their side. Thank you for my olive oil. Much appreciated.

6435 2018-11-23 19:08:38 Just need to read the labels and choose no palm oil products 
6436 2018-11-23 19:08:22 Maybe the world needs to ignore their leadership and put their own foot on Saudi Arabia? A couple years of $20 Oil would inflict far more punishment on them our Governments ever will. And as a plus, they wouldn't have billions to spend on arms.
6437 2018-11-23 19:08:21 Without oil, we would have to do without 75% of the products we take for granted.
6438 2018-11-23 19:08:10 Oil prices are going down, price of gas is going down in Miami, but still the same high prices in the @Cityofdoral Florida @Shell @Chevron @Marathon_Gas
6439 2018-11-23 19:08:10 So if oil is so worthless why don’t WM hand the revenues and control over the Scottish Govt?
6440 2018-11-23 19:08:07 You have little or nothing to do with low gas prices.  The world is looking at a significant economic slowdown which will produce a glut of oil and for this reason the market is collapsing.  You are not the center of the frigging universe!
6441 2018-11-23 19:08:06 Damn skippy
6442 2018-11-23 19:07:54 If it was not for Saudi being an enemy of Iran, not to mention big money  in arms sales which they supply to the terrorists, we would not support  them. oh forgot; OIL OIL OIL OIL OIL AND $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
6443 2018-11-23 19:07:51 Too funny. 
People aren’t allowed to leave Alberta and criticize if they have a problem with oil patch culture?
People who benefit from the oil patch can’t criticize it?
Yup.
You’re part of the problem.
How’s the dealing with it going?

6448 2018-11-23 19:07:44 Someone needs to explain this to the Norwegians, they have been foolishly raking in billions from the oil and gas sector unwittingly, obviously.
6449 2018-11-23 19:07:41 @Tikititime @Bennyd111 @ivan_talboys to be clear, I’m not currently offering to make sandwiches out of humans. Although I’m not averse, if the boiling takes place in oil and they get nice and crispy.
6450 2018-11-23 19:07:41 That's all the government care about is oil . Not people,  yet again the Arabs get away with murder.
6451 2018-11-23 19:07:40 Does Trump buy gas or oil??? Prices are up since he took office.
6452 2018-11-23 19:07:36 SOMEONE SELL ME AN OIL CARTRIDGE NOW
6453 2018-11-23 19:07:35 Oil does so much more then run machines.  Plastics have been a boon the to medical industry, increasing sanitation & helping sterile environments remain free of contaminates.  Most, if not all, synthetics are derived from fossil fuels.
6454 2018-11-23 19:07:26 All while stimulating demand for oil, via uneconomic price discounts.
Gas meet flame.
6455 2018-11-23 19:07:23 Come off it, rightwing Albertans are the whiniest whiners in the country. And Justin Trudeau and Rachel Notley have shown far more respect for the industry than the liars like Jason Kenney who ignores the oil CEOs as well as our need to cut GHG emissions.

6459 2018-11-23 19:06:43 Oil price drops shouldn’t come as a surprise. Why does everyone tweet like it is? Crude oil is not as scarce as you thought. Also, there’s already conscious alternatives for its uses in many industries already.
6460 2018-11-23 19:06:40 Its got to do with the fact that people think 'sovereignty' is only about flags and states when its also about corporations. We could be independent and still not own the oil

Any loadings over the weekend are going to be tied to an out-of-date number. This is their job.  #OOTT
6470 2018-11-23 19:05:50 Alaskans own 34,236 shares of MAIRE TECNIMONT SPA, worth $128,160. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in ITALY.
6471 2018-11-23 19:05:47 They don’t survive if we don’t buy the oil. All their military hardware is American. The US has all the cards. Nothing will happen because Trump&fam profit personally off the Saudis.

6474 2018-11-23 19:05:30 Yup at this point Saudi Arabia will drop to 12$ just to keep the party going. As more countries break with Saudi Arabia you can count on the oil price to keep dropping.
6475 2018-11-23 19:05:28 Any restaurant in 2018 that’s STILL using peanut oil deserves to go bankrupt.  it’s like playing with a loaded gun for a lot of families
6476 2018-11-23 19:05:24 Ppl are insane! I love essential oils and "homeopathy for skin care or a cold. But if you think tea tree oil is better than antibiotics for infections. You deserve the opportunistic pathogens that eat your face off.  Lol
6477 2018-11-23 19:05:23 The Saudis caused this by saying they could fill any demand, pump more oil etc...Now they are living with the consequences. And to get prices up again it will be a struggle.

6480 2018-11-23 19:04:37 IMO you don’t need a view on oil prices to like energy names here, you just need to believe hydrocarbons are still viable.
6481 2018-11-23 19:04:36 Some very good points here. Oil might have been better off finishing out of it again, getting yet another lottery pick (Drivefor5, baby!!) then firing coach and GM. But oh well. Could still happen. Roster still sucks.
6482 2018-11-23 19:04:31 No one can call oil sales illicit when the claim is based on statements made by a rogue state which is smashing international law and threatens to punish everyone who doesn't smash it alongside them.
6483 2018-11-23 19:04:29 .@arableague_gs OPEC plus Russia should sell low cost oil to the EU for a long period of time buy EU Market where is down, Future is for sale, just buy it...

6487 2018-11-23 19:04:11 I'd like to know what is your explanation for a price oil of $11?, regards
6488 2018-11-23 19:04:10 The tax revenues are low when oil is below $70 per barrel. it cost $40 per barrel to extract and the oil companies can right off millions in decommissioning costs against the tax they pay.
6489 2018-11-23 19:04:07 welcome to Oil Country.  We're excited to have you.

6495 2018-11-23 19:03:33 Midstream slightly beat the S&P 500 this week, despite ~10% oil drop and seasonal headwinds...that’s a win, even if it feels bad. Set up for strength when oil finds a floor...
6496 2018-11-23 19:03:26 Totally agree. Been saying it for years. A nationalised oil firm which directly benefits the Scottish treasury.
6497 2018-11-23 19:03:21 Having a nice smelling home is essential and that's why I use essential oil.m. I'm about to make my home smell like a French lavender field. I might even say ooh la la because I have it on good  authority that they say it in French fields.

6499 2018-11-23 19:03:15 And all it cost them was a near-guaranteed $200+ oil spike at some point in the next few years, when the complete lack of investment makes it impossible for supply to remotely keep up with demand.

Great.
6500 2018-11-23 19:03:13 We're not back to secret oil field again are we?
6501 2018-11-23 19:03:13 Beg your pardon?  Love to see the “contributors” to that sordid enterprise ...Saudi Arabia, MBS, the Adelsons, Big Oil, the miserable list goes on and on.
6502 2018-11-23 19:03:11 Sensible and socialist don’t really mix. If it’s any consolation, I agree that Thatcher did not handle north sea oil revenues well.
6503 2018-11-23 19:03:10 Further, 2 families living in one house taxed at very low rate, with 5 to 8 or more children put a greater stress on schools than an American in a single family home or Apt. It's just a fact.
6504 2018-11-23 19:03:10 Water repels the oil, doesn't help making the pasta less sticky - you can add a few drops after you've taken the pasta out of the water though
6505 2018-11-23 19:03:09 White Pudding however everything is cooked in the same oil so never actually vegetarian.
6506 2018-11-23 19:03:07 Thanks to a mega generous tax regime provided by the UK in return for the business the oil co's bring to the City of London. If you think BP etc are not generating massive taxable profits from Scottish oil fields you are seriously mistaken. It's how  the UK casino economy works.
6507 2018-11-23 19:03:07 It is as it always has been and will be to the day he passes on his 'legacy.' Donald Trump the barker selling Snake Oil & Miracle Cures.
6508 2018-11-23 19:02:45 I guess it is possible if you have the best and most secretive banking system in the world where mostly 3rd world leaders can safely stash their loots, then you dont have to worry about polluting your environment (manufacturing, oil indstry, etc)..You also have good governance
6509 2018-11-23 19:02:42 Independent of Assets, Cash is king in a crisis. Oil companies will want what Tag has on its books if the China/USA trade issue is calmed down. If not, if tensions rise, while then YF Finance needs to secure oil supply for China. Win in either outcome, NZ has insulation from USA
6510 2018-11-23 19:02:41 FACTS: Erdogan’s Turkey gets oil from Iran and Kurds in North Iraq. Trump’s boycots of oil from the region made Turkey eager for Saudi oil (if needed).
And Turkey delivers oil to Israel.
6511 2018-11-23 19:02:38 Oil has me shook! All it’s done is melt yet I can’t get an entry on it that meets my fking rules.

I dno how to trade something moving that fast and it’s pissed me off tbh.

I’ve got a lot to learn.
6512 2018-11-23 19:02:38 40% of our oil comes from Canada. 11% from  Saudi Arabia. Cut them off and we won't feel a thing. You've done nothing for oil prices. Nada.
6513 2018-11-23 19:02:37 120000 barrels?? That’s nothing compared to the amount of snake oil Murdo produces.
6514 2018-11-23 19:02:33 i realized excessive oil makes my tummy do THE THING
6515 2018-11-23 19:02:28 There’s other oil fields Jim
6516 2018-11-23 19:02:24 I make a fried mashed potato/stuffing combo in the skillet with some oil. But this waffle concoction is a game changer
6517 2018-11-23 19:02:22 hes not wrong america does need that oil ! lol
6518 2018-11-23 19:02:21 If we were able to clean our oil ourselves, we could sell our oil at full price. Instead the gov wants another crappy pipeline from Enron Kinder Morgan.
6519 2018-11-23 19:02:15 From the people who brought you olive oil
6520 2018-11-23 19:02:07 Я без мейка, только брови 
6521 2018-11-23 19:02:06 It’s his own personal investments nothing to do with oil markets
6522 2018-11-23 19:02:05 There was a 4% Black Friday special on oil.
Hit $50s today.

Down from a peak of $76 about a month ago.
6523 2018-11-23 19:01:57 Watch out for false friends between Spanish and Portuguese. Aceite means olive oil in Spanish but admitted or accepted in Portuguese. #languageclasses #atlanta #ga
6524 2018-11-23 19:01:56 GENIUS - I LOVE IT!!! We've been giving her CBD but w/o the THC & nothing! My daughter talked her into trying a vape w/THC oil. Maybe today!!
6525 2018-11-23 19:01:52 If oil keeps sliding next week Christmas hokiday commutes will cost at least 10 % less than thanksgiving.
6526 2018-11-23 19:01:47 The Saudis were doing some weak chatter about cuts and the market swiftly punished them. This is really Al Falih's fault for having last month talked about 12m bpd of production and that they could supply everyone etc. Now the market is saying that oil needs to be cheap.
6527 2018-11-23 19:01:44 Low oil prices...is @realDonaldTrump squeezing the Saudis to lower prices? And he found the leverage to do so.
6528 2018-11-23 19:01:35 InfoChip has been creating custom #RFID solutions for Oil & Gas fields for years. We strive to make the perfect tag for every situation.
6529 2018-11-23 19:01:34 Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, says the LORD YAH.
6530 2018-11-23 19:01:21 She said I didn’t deserve her, she said she isn’t attracted to me, she doesn’t know how to love me and she prefers oil workers.
6531 2018-11-23 19:01:18 7.7% is a huge drop for oil. You hardly see such...
6532 2018-11-23 19:01:08 While the study is ongoing, there is an understanding that the oil cartel’s efforts to affect crude prices through production quotas has raised costs for American consumers.
6533 2018-11-23 19:00:57 Last week, I bought a bunch of stripper clips for my 5.56 ammo. They work and it'll no doubt make reloading my magazines at the range easier, but getting them in was a little tough.

Was I supposed to oil the clips before putting the rounds in or something?
6534 2018-11-23 19:00:51 We gotta burn all the oil to bring the mega  herbivores and the African woodlands back guys
6535 2018-11-23 19:00:40 Some positive reading...

Eurozone consumer spending likely to rise as oil prices fall.

"On past form, the drop in oil prices in euro terms points to quarterly real
household spending growth rising from 0.2% in Q2 to about 0.5% in Q4" according to Capital Economics
6536 2018-11-23 19:00:40 @GovInslee Instead of beating your own drum why dont you help the citizens of Wa and drill into why gas prices remain high when oil is dropping . Quintessential  Pol
6537 2018-11-23 19:00:39 Love when I have my oil burning.  it smells sooo good
6538 2018-11-23 19:00:34 Germany,Denmark and Finland won’t continue to sell weapons to kill civilians in Yemen.  Not so for dictator Trump, nukes next.  I want my country to export  11% of our oil , not 40% to USA , as a sanction for his response to outright murder by Saudi’s.
6539 2018-11-23 19:00:28 Leech oil
6540 2018-11-23 19:00:27 Wonder how many the oil rich gulf states are taking? ( Rhetorical)
6541 2018-11-23 19:00:26 Trump went to OPEC asked them to start putting out more barrels a day because he was going to stops Iran's oil sales which he has not done, now the market has an oil glut. Saudi Arabia is pissed because he liad to them for making them pump more oil driving the price down,
6542 2018-11-23 19:00:25 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
6543 2018-11-23 19:00:24 Instead of being asked, “are you still single?” I got asked, “have you changed the oil in that car?” 

Oh?
6544 2018-11-23 19:00:24 Somebody will be cooking white rice only for it to b looking like u put palm oil, everywhere brown dust.. . Dis enugu eh.. There is something @CHINWENDUH is not telling me.. I miss Akwa Ibom mbok..

6546 2018-11-23 19:00:12 "Oil tumbles more than 7% to $50.42, now down more than 30% in 7 weeks"

A highly publicized murder that led to back-scratching of mutual sides.

6547 2018-11-23 19:00:11 Don't be naive. The government are the ones with the snake oil. They have done nothing to improve anything for anyone in 8 years. Snakes selling oil. We need a new way that actually gives a shit.
6548 2018-11-23 19:00:10 How about: Alberta is suing Big Oil b/c they’ve destroyed the top third of the province
6549 2018-11-23 19:00:10 Crude Oil Prices (11-23-2018)
WTI: $50.42 (-4.21) 
Brent: $59.22 (-3.38)

6550 2018-11-23 18:59:44 But the cult thinks he controls the oil prices and Obama controlled the stock market. Yes they are that damn ignorant.
6551 2018-11-23 18:59:38 In 2008 NZD went up 45% as USA Crisis unfolded. No reason to not repeat history. If the USD soars, then CASH on a balance sheet is even more desired.
Tag Oil has $30 million in cash coming March 31, 2009. The warrants collapsed to 1 penny today. For 1 cent you can control $0.90
6552 2018-11-23 18:59:36 We're in need of such welfarism in our area. We're so desperate and inhopeful with this administration, we need your philantropical support Comrade. And in shaa Allah we will vote for you, irrespective of the party you live into.
6553 2018-11-23 18:59:31 Oil falls 7.7% in its biggest one-day percentage decline since July 2015, as investors grow increasingly concerned about a supply surge  -- The Wall Street Journal
6554 2018-11-23 18:59:22 Expect Trump will tell them he is increasing Iran Sanctions on January 2019, by limiting some of the waivers that were given.

Once Holiday Season is over, higher oil prices won't matter too much to USA until May when Driving Season starts.
6555 2018-11-23 18:59:18 Hi Emma, that's a shame . I can't eat your mince pies until you don't use Palm oil but thanks for your reply
6556 2018-11-23 18:59:15 Unacceptable @FirestoneTires, 5 freaking hours for an oil change. I was told it would be 2. Thanks for ruining my day!

6558 2018-11-23 18:58:56 that would be smaller drilling ones tho lol. coz as far as I have seen, heavy drilling equipment generally use oil as the fluid. I haven't worked on them tho.
6559 2018-11-23 18:58:55 This is a stupid question but aren’t we exporting oil?
6560 2018-11-23 18:58:55 THESE HAVE RANGED FROM FALSE CORPS ADVERTISING ALGAE OIL REFINEMENT INTO GASOLINE( SCAMMERS) AND 
TRADE FAMINES TO STOP NEEDED MATERIALS FOR BUILDING
AS WELL AS THOSE HIRED SPECIFICALLY TO DELAY THWART
AND WAR AGAINST ELECTRO-PORTATION (BIG OIL&GAS&MEDIA)
6561 2018-11-23 18:58:49 After seeing neighbors had already adopted nearby drains, I noticed: Most of Mission Bay's brand new infrastructure dumps oil and garbage from its streets directly into the Bay. Also, streets around Lake Merced, SF's emergency drinking water supply
6562 2018-11-23 18:58:47 rose hip seed oil by the ordinary
6563 2018-11-23 18:58:38 Moved from MB to AB 41 yrs ago, shocked at 1-party state #abpoli & irked how Albertans crowed about their prosperity being all due to hard work, rugged individualism. Never a word on lucky to have oil & gas. To me, folks in MB (rest of ) worked just as hard but w/o black gold
6564 2018-11-23 18:58:37 But not for the consumers. The oil companies collect happily! #Trumps buddies
6565 2018-11-23 18:58:31 No. 22 million illegals competing for jobs, housing, med care, schools, "resources," not beneficial to the least among us. Take housing. They live in scarce housing Americans could live in. Building more puts housing outside range of low income Americans
6566 2018-11-23 18:58:25  I’m blinkered maybe look at yourself before throwing out accusations. As I said no big veg companies falsifying research. No PBWF research is saying oil is good for you. I’m willing to say that a 98% plant based diet is healthy your worse than a militant vegan.
6567 2018-11-23 18:58:17 लगता है आप को कुछ ज्ञान  नहीं है!
Int oil market का!
6568 2018-11-23 18:58:13 Oil pulling is so gross but I can’t stop 
6569 2018-11-23 18:58:12 I mean , let me catch you up. Trump had boasted our Oil/Gas industries would POWER GROWTH in the US as Exporters. Think shales will keep producing when they SOON will be LOOSING MONEY??
6570 2018-11-23 18:58:10 It's so strange how novels snap into place, one minute you are naked wrestling with it in oil and the next it's wearing a suit, holding out its hand and saying 'how do you do?'

6575 2018-11-23 18:57:51 With dirty Alberta output nearing $10 a barrel, oil biz has a problem. Cenovus says that shipping oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast costs around US$20 per barrel.
Solution? Have taxpayers subsidize transport costs. 
That would be climate change action, Liberal style.

6578 2018-11-23 18:57:35 Trident unfortunately. That and the oil...
6579 2018-11-23 18:57:34 Snake oil salesman.
6580 2018-11-23 18:57:29 And it was Swinney who begged Osborne to slash tax on oil companies when the price collapsed. Osborne obliged. Nats tend not to understand what ‘oil income’ is, though.
6581 2018-11-23 18:57:26 Trump fucked with the oil industry thinking he was helping and suddenly I was up like 300% on shorts against oil companies, I'm starting to understand this Russian concept of a "Useful idiot"..........
6582 2018-11-23 18:57:25 @pepboysauto how am I given the keys back to my car. And pay the bill but my car is still on the lift? I cam in for an oil change and a wheel balance 8 hours ago
6583 2018-11-23 18:57:22 He knows. He just wants the oil revenues to keep flowing into his pockets.
6584 2018-11-23 18:57:21 Yup. After all hair oil, fairness creams, bournvita, shampoos....yahi sab to hai safalta ki chabi....
6585 2018-11-23 18:57:20 If the USA markets sell off, demand for USD goes upward The USD going upward will kill spending in emerging markets. The Fed cannot hike Dec 18th if Oil and Markets go past a correction into freefall The NZD is a safehaven if the USD soars because of what comes next. Fed Reverse
6586 2018-11-23 18:57:19 Oil Prices Hit 2018 Low As Global Supplies Rise
6587 2018-11-23 18:57:16 And the US pays less than half the world price for Canadian oil.  Bit tougher to refine, but not twice as hard.

6589 2018-11-23 18:57:07 My dog ate a whole bottle of fish oil pills and she smells like a sewage plant now but her hair is really soft at least
6590 2018-11-23 18:57:04 Thought BBC said the oil was running out?
6591 2018-11-23 18:57:04 Truth and justice are our strategic interests. Our power is derived from the innate pull of these basic human rights on peoples hearts and psyche. Oil over blood is a perverted policy that debases the fundamental underpinning of our democracy - the protection of the individual.
6592 2018-11-23 18:56:59 He looks like an oil painting , so regal
6593 2018-11-23 18:56:55 1. Head massage with any hair oil, if oil with cold ingredients lyk navratra oil or kailash parbat oil for atleast 10 mins.

6598 2018-11-23 18:56:37 That looks amazing! Just a heads up though those @Pillsbury Cressant Rolls have Palm Oil in them. I dont know if you know about whats happening to the Orangutans but just wanted to let you know

6602 2018-11-23 18:55:47 Just had oregano oil, going to go buy more garlic, and ginger. This illness is trying to come back and I REFUSE to let it win
6603 2018-11-23 18:55:45 @realDonaldTrump So the TAX PAYERS are going to pay for your wall. People he said Mexico is going to pay. Don’t you look stupid they are not. #lier Enough with this #Conman . Markets are down. Thank you Canada for giving us LOW price on oil. It’s not Saudi
6604 2018-11-23 18:55:32 How can we be loyal to party that has rule an oil rich state like ours for close to 20yrs and yet no meaningful developmental plan not to talk of development itself.
6605 2018-11-23 18:55:32 That was quite a twist by BBC Reporting Scotland on how to turn the oil production story off Shetland into a negative. Top class propaganda I have to say...
6606 2018-11-23 18:55:28 Haven't oil prices gone down? Why am I still paying $6500  to fill up?
6607 2018-11-23 18:55:27 Perfect start to the weekend when u run over something and your car starts pishing oil. That’ll be my bank getting rinseddddd
6608 2018-11-23 18:55:23 @mreazi forget them..them no fit stop this God wave..mama don put oil ontop the head!
6609 2018-11-23 18:55:21 Trudeau and the liberals are going to lose the election strictly because of what they have done to the Canadian energy industry. Allowing the U.S to rob us of our oil is a national disgrace and something every Canadian should be furious about regardless of which party you support
6610 2018-11-23 18:55:15 Wow. People even have CBD oil on sale for black friday. Heh.
6611 2018-11-23 18:55:15 Hahaha good one. Oil companies make profit so good investment.

You want to stop education because some students might end up in the oil industry?

You can try but not paying tax is not the same as subsidizing, as goes for electric cars.
6612 2018-11-23 18:55:14 President Trump's story line is incredulous as we all know Oil is a global market,. An nation Mister Bone Saw and the Saudis sell their Oil to,. Lowers the Oil Price equally globally. Another ridiculous lie.
6613 2018-11-23 18:55:02 They havent a clue on the 3 land borders uk has with 3 different eu countries. NI is a excuss by remoaners to keep us in EU. Remoaners are unable to think. 1 idiot today told me without eu we will have no oil. I reminded him uk produce 22* more oil than the whole of the eu
6614 2018-11-23 18:54:59 Lmao neck about to be stiff. Oil your scalp thoroughly.
6615 2018-11-23 18:54:59 What? Oh & just a majority of folk wanting to remain in the UK as well. Just love you seps going on about oor oil.

6617 2018-11-23 18:54:52 Carbon... that common term for the stuff that makes plants grow.

I say burn more coal and oil... for the health of the plants.
6618 2018-11-23 18:54:29 Maybe the lie about the oil west of Scotland as reported by the BBC in 2014 has something to do with it? The BBC have been found out again.
6619 2018-11-23 18:54:23 Stir fry your ham with a little garlic, oil and butter Add shredded cabbage, cracked pepper, a dash of cumin and a squeeze of lemon or drop of white wine or dry sherry...
Serve on its own or with rice or potatoes flavoured with dash of soy
6620 2018-11-23 18:54:16 Oh thanks for clearing that up. I was thinking, olive oil? vegetable oil? essential oil? 
6621 2018-11-23 18:54:15 Actually turns out we found a secret oil field off Scotland, hearts still joint top of league and a weekend of rugby ahead. So not all bad.
6622 2018-11-23 18:54:14 Oh... 'Harry's Oil Line' was doing well on the London Stock Exchange :)
6623 2018-11-23 18:54:12 Better enjoy it while we can before the trump administration sells them to oil and coal interests.
6624 2018-11-23 18:54:00 when oil prices come down thats one thing but when they collapse there will be repercussions some big oil producing entity country company or a consortium is going break apart in its seems I vote total collapse of saudi finances they r not kings they r thugs
6625 2018-11-23 18:54:00 Anyone taken in means 1 must be released into the U.S. They are being released, even yet by the bus loads promising to show up later. 
Because the pace doesn't suit them? 
This must be done quietly, on down low or they will see even more backlash. Just truth
6626 2018-11-23 18:53:54 Please mix baby and vegetable oil in Chuck’s sun tan lotion...

6629 2018-11-23 18:53:32 The president has little to no effect on the cost of crude oil but I'm sure you knew that.
6630 2018-11-23 18:53:26 So what you say is don't use #palm oil in #biodiesel? How would you compare it with other vegetable oils being used in biofuels? And what about the makers of those bad Diesel engines and cars? @sathia_varqa
6631 2018-11-23 18:53:23 Also we arent going to be one of these pussy assed, liberal, nice to the neighbourhood kids types cartels. We will boil our enemies in oil.
6632 2018-11-23 18:53:00 When you eat pizza and ya mustache smells like oil & cheese
6633 2018-11-23 18:52:57 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil and flour three 9 by 1 1/2-inch round pans. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder. In another large bowl, whisk together the oil, buttermilk, eggs, food coloring, vinegar, and vanilla.
6634 2018-11-23 18:52:42 Asked my pops if they did Black Friday deals on oil changes and sadly they don’t.. /:
6635 2018-11-23 18:52:39 China to resume imports of oil from #Iran soon 
#OOTT
6636 2018-11-23 18:52:32 The perfect medicine! I'm just about to have some medicinal beers to oil the joints after a gruelling freezing game of golf (tweeted a photo).....might have a gin or two for good measure....cheers 
6637 2018-11-23 18:52:27 Stop trying to crash the oil prices. They are way low as it is. So stop.
6638 2018-11-23 18:52:24 Wrong? Not just wrong: another of the Lieberals outrageous lies. They have accomplished NOTHING except a messy legalisation of pot. And destroying Canada's oil industry while importing billions worth of oil from unethical countries.

6641 2018-11-23 18:52:09 Sold your soul, if you even have one, to the devil for the sake of getting oil prices back down to where they were when you stole office...

6643 2018-11-23 18:51:57 And what most Nat Scot’s still haven’t figured out yet, is that the EU wouldn’t let us join until N.Sea oil was found. Since then they’re the ones who been asset stripping it & the fish stocks is the N.Sea, not England.
6644 2018-11-23 18:51:48 @VinnieTortorich just ordered my first 3L tin of olive oil from @VillaCappelli thanks for the recommendation! Looking forward to getting it. Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving!
6645 2018-11-23 18:51:47 Thats a FACTOR ..Of course!  However being FULLY Aware the FED was not only Raising Rates BUT liquidating bonds may NOT have been the BEST TIME to TANK OIL markets??? I mean Trump owns Hotels ...He wouldn't lower room rates to the point of LOOSING MONEY..Would he?
6646 2018-11-23 18:51:45 Looking at the market, most likely a hedge fund just liquidated all its oil positions.
6647 2018-11-23 18:51:45 Well, we saw free oil money and we left other resources that God gave us including land and human resources. We have one of the most fertile land on earth. Also, we have one of the most intelligent people in the world but all are wasting away. Now oil money is no more.
6648 2018-11-23 18:51:37 And a price rift in the oil market.
6649 2018-11-23 18:51:34 And unfortunately a massive homeless problem caused and created by greedy politicians Piers, you should look into Denis O Brien, it would truly leave you speechless and all the oil around our Island, no money being made from this, though our politicians look mightily smug!
6650 2018-11-23 18:51:27 You’d look bomb with that oil slick style hair color
6651 2018-11-23 18:51:25 French oil or I start throwing baguettes

6653 2018-11-23 18:51:12 Go read how mcuh tax oil generates, and with decommisioning that's not expected to rise. Tax income down from $10b a year to barely a billion. THat's why Scotland has such a huge deficit.
6654 2018-11-23 18:51:10 I have worked with oil... its how I started...Nah...it wouldn't suit you. Doesn't suit me, either and I'll never be remotely tempted to go back to it.
6655 2018-11-23 18:51:08 I'm sure the vehicle skidded on that oil and crashed. The driver was distraught that their lovely Rover was totalled so consoled themselves with a stiff drinky or two. Perfectly reasonable. Signed: Nick Freeman.
6656 2018-11-23 18:51:05 Amethyst body oil infused with lilac, druzy, and judgment for inspiration and softness.

6658 2018-11-23 18:50:59  It's out oil & gas go find your ain without fracking your country tae pieces.
6659 2018-11-23 18:50:58 I like it that he totally is best buds with Saudi Arabia. Even denying that hit on Kashoggi!
Really nice of him that he sides with murderers just for the sake of getting their oil! #idiocracy
6660 2018-11-23 18:50:58 C'mon with it.
I need 500 kms so I can change the oil in my skidoo. 
6661 2018-11-23 18:50:55 I remember my mom was sleeping on her recliner, & I got some olive oil & touched her forehead, & said a silence prayer & she just lifted her hands. 
6662 2018-11-23 18:50:53 I will be very surprised if the Fed raises interest rates in Dec. They need to pause & revaluate the global economy. The move in oil $CL is very concerning. That along with the stock & housing markets clearly show we are cooling off & it’s happening at a rapid pace. $SPY $USD
6663 2018-11-23 18:50:51 My brother this exactly the why we are praying & fighting for Biafra NOT only for Oil.. We want a clear segregation of people,, our reasoning aren’t the same
6664 2018-11-23 18:50:51 @mariahlleonard in douglas we have the option to get our skin scanned for hydration. It verified my suspicion that my oily skin results from dehydrated skin. Dehydrated skin can easily be mistaken for dry skin but are completly different. Dry skin need oil, the other moisture.
6665 2018-11-23 18:50:49 Most @GOP voters are cool with the murder of a US resident and WaPo journalist because we import 7% of our oil from Saudi Arabia so fu ck  “most Republican voters”.

6667 2018-11-23 18:50:44 Gee Whizzers, explain to me why so many charities are unable to meet their fund raising goals in Alberta? Could it be that the oil and gas sector has no surplus funds available to support needy causes like they used to? Probably not, it's likely just greedy  conservatives?
6668 2018-11-23 18:50:43 Crude oil plunges 8 percent in a day.

US stock market is having worst thanksgiving after long time.

It’s just a start, get ready for disaster.
6669 2018-11-23 18:50:42 U.S. oil books worst day in about 3 years after tanking nearly 8%

6672 2018-11-23 18:50:23 I have some patience, but when it comes to car services. I have zero. Waiting to get an oil change is the worst. Hate the waiting game
6673 2018-11-23 18:50:19 No @BradMossEsq,  not for oil (which at this point we don't need any more) -- 

-- but rather for the anti-DeathToAmerica Iran coalition, which we do need.
6674 2018-11-23 18:50:16 In 1979, Mexico's oil production climbed 6.9% in 24 days over its daily output in October.

6677 2018-11-24 23:59:39 Coconut oil, no heat on it, no chemicals such as gels, mousse or hair sprays, don’t comb it when it’s wet,  use a comb instead of a brush, get it trimmed every so often to get the dead ends off..try to wear it down and take some biotin vitamins..

@LindaFoods, time to drop palm oil from your products
6712 2018-11-24 23:57:43 There are some people that we dont want on our team. Disingenuous conspiracy theorists hawking snake oil are among them. They are bad gas for the machine. Poison.

6721 2018-11-24 23:56:12 I don’t care how virgin or extra virgin or touched by an angel or whatever it is, olive oil just still isn’t butter.

6733 2018-11-24 23:54:34 Donald Trump says he's good for business in America, the reality couldn't be further. Trump's trade wars with the world, in this case the Sino-U.S. trade war, have diminished any real hope for the American oil industry's comeback. It's time for a #GreenNewDeal.

6737 2018-11-24 23:53:41 I love molded jellies. If you want to get into the squarest cooking activity in the kitchen, here are some tips:

6743 2018-11-24 23:52:54 Transporting  oil by tanker to India to be refined in a pollution centre in a country with human rights issues kind of negates the message. And that's what the @AndrewScheer and @jkenney trips appear to be about.

6754 2018-11-24 23:51:50 So the States can have our oil for almost nothing because we cannot get our oil to tidewater effectively. Great forethought from 40+ years PC gov’t! This is why you need more than one viable party in a province smh

6761 2018-11-24 23:51:17 1)  Some don't get the Eurodollar (to use a quote 'Everything begins and ends with the Fed having to uphold the integrity of the so-called “eurodollar”. 2) Some missed the trend that US will become Oil & Gas exporter in the next few yrs (Oil first) so petrodollar is obsolete.

6764 2018-11-24 23:51:00 My mama taught me how to make pasta, and she said that if you don't salt or olive oil the pasta, you won't make it past this date.
6765 2018-11-24 23:50:51 Clove oil in the drugstore numbs tooth pain, if you need it. I lost a bridge when I accidentally bought caramels instead of hard candy and I couldn’t resist eating one.

6767 2018-11-24 23:50:28 What is outstanding was seeing all the oil wells in Iraq buring as British #ArmedForces pushed forward against Saddam Hussein but #fuelprice remained & are still crippling

Iraq has probably the biggest oil resource in the world so why wasn’t it secured by British forces? @FT
6768 2018-11-24 23:50:24 All you need is sesame oil, rice wine vinegar and soy sauce to make most Chinese recipes 
6769 2018-11-24 23:50:24 GIVE HER GODS GIFT OF

6770 2018-11-24 23:50:13 Nothing wrong with olive oil...
6771 2018-11-24 23:50:06 In the near term it’s not improbable that we can see a US face-saving trade deal with China, neutral Dec Fed meeting and a production cut by OPEC.  Many would be surprised to see oil back at 60-65 bucks EOY.  I wouldn’t be.

6774 2018-11-24 23:49:19 Is that why they lock up innocent UK citizens for life after a 5 minute trial. Disgusting country that should be ostracised by the UK. Will be a ghost state once the oil runs out.

6777 2018-11-24 23:49:11 The Exxon-Guyana oil will not only revolutionise Guyana, it may also have a profound impact on US foreign politics. Their dependency on Middle Eastern oil will be alot lower, so we may see a shift in their ME strategy because of this.
6778 2018-11-24 23:49:02 Oil of Olay has been around over 80 years. You'd think they'd hype all their fabulous anti-aging success stories. So... where are they? Unless, maybe, do you think...?

6782 2018-11-24 23:48:22 @Tesco Hello, I was wondering if you sell mince pie mincemeat that doesn't contain palm oil? 
I was having a look in one of your stores today but could only find 1 option of mincemeat available and it contains palm oil.
6783 2018-11-24 23:48:12 If you look at the House of Commons website you will discover that oil & gas is within the top four topics of discussion in this sitting of the House. The PM emails his daily schedule so you can see how often he is in the House.
6784 2018-11-24 23:48:07 I wish my cbd oil would just get here already. I'm tired of having such bad anxiety and panic attacks
6785 2018-11-24 23:47:50 Bring water to boil, add salt, place pasta in. Olive oil is for people who dont know what theyre doing.
6786 2018-11-24 23:47:46 You should get out more. Go visit a farmer and ask the foreman at an oil refinery how often they get visited by the feds. Your opinions would change ... or they would if you were being honest. Can’t depend on you for that tho.

6796 2018-11-24 23:46:47 Commend your calmness, although feel like screaming on your belhalf. Appreciate their historic love of fossil fuels, but stunned by lack of knowledge of impact and lack of understanding that they’re finite. None of the defenders answer, ‘what happens when oil & coal are gone?’
6797 2018-11-24 23:46:19 That damn “comfort” at bath and body works is AMAZING 
It’s in the essential oil line 
6798 2018-11-24 23:46:06 there was one time in a dnd session that like none of our party members went so it was?? 3 players + the dm when we usually have 6 players and we had the most chaotic players so we poured oil on 30 rats and set them all on fire and we took like 12 points of damage

6809 2018-11-24 23:44:46 First Nations-led Eagle Spirit Energy has laid out plans for a pipeline/energy corridor between Alberta & northern BC. Due to Bill C-48 they're looking at jumping border to ship
Corridor wouldn’t be far from tankers that have been shipping Alaskan oil down B.C. coast for decades.
6810 2018-11-24 23:44:24 “ Sir”being the key giveaway ,as up to no good ,in the the title of“oil guru Ian Wood”...this “expert” lied his face off in order to deliberately deceive the people of Scotland in the run up to their 2014 Ref ..as if not rich enuf already,this greedy man has not been forgotten
6811 2018-11-24 23:44:05 Of course climate changes. Always has, always will. Land rises, land falls. The debate is about man's influence, or specifically, is Co2 likely to harm us, & will mining for Li metals & oil for turbines & batteries make a difference - compared with, say, wild-fires.
6812 2018-11-24 23:44:00 Nuclear power plants are green energy, but no one can get one built these days.
Hydro power is protested because it might interfere with a fish.
Windmills and solar panels will never suppy the world's needs. 
Look up everything that needs oil to be manufactured.

6823 2018-11-24 23:43:13 Ms Philips. There’s something happening in Alberta & Sask it’s not pretty. Goes back to Premier Laugheed & PM Trudeau & National Energy dispute. Regardless who’s to blame for Ont & Que relying solely on foreign oil, it’s going to get really ugly next May after Notley’s gone. Sad!

Now we know why Trump doesn’t want to Travel.

6836 2018-11-24 23:40:30 Julian doesn't have kids obviously or the last thing he'd be doing is figuring how to extract more oil.

Don't be a Julian. Say no to #CAPP.
6837 2018-11-24 23:40:30 Palmers olive oil conditioning spray oil. Super good! Ive tried other products but nothing compares to this
6838 2018-11-24 23:40:28 What would this different NDP government have done? Forced a cleanup? First half of their mandate, there was an oil patch recession. A publicly funded cleanup? It’s a $27-B problem. Must be nice to be an Ontario social democrat.
6839 2018-11-24 23:40:26 “Claimed it was an accident” oh this has oil written all over it
6840 2018-11-24 23:40:16 Will you also be reducing the amount of non responsibly sourced palm oil?
6841 2018-11-24 23:40:12 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
6842 2018-11-24 23:40:02 I am healing up well and quickly. I apply the derma life aloe vera, vitamin E oil for Trader Joes, and the neoporin. I tried to hold myself when I fell. I am growing new skin and the cuts are sealing well. I am pleased with this. I will not have scaring.
6843 2018-11-24 23:39:53 Hmm, I used neem oil for midgey flies indoors. Haven’t heard that it would work outside, but mild, organic soap flake solution definitely does! Coffee grounds & shattered egg shells if slugs are an issue, heap atound the base of vulnerable plants. Coffee grounds high in nitrogen!

6846 2018-11-24 23:39:34 All we ever get is "treatments" not "cures" EVER. You people have kept us from the truth for too long with your poisons and promises. CBD hemp oil stops seizures. Period. The wizards and warlocks of Big Pharma have killed too many of us.
6847 2018-11-24 23:39:32 They legit probably use motor oil to make it look better, Like how they use shaving cream for whipped cream so they can take longer to film it.
6848 2018-11-24 23:39:26 We can’t burn it if we want a decent chance of surviving on this planet beyond the next 20 yrs. So aye. Oil bad.
6849 2018-11-24 23:39:24 Like jimmy Carter said we’re going to run out of oil when he was president.

6852 2018-11-24 23:39:02 In the market today this very sweet elderly Man asked me if I knew where an item could be found. He then gave me a 10-15 minute lesson on buying olive oil. What type and why and what was the best price. Seriously sweet as could be.

6856 2018-11-24 23:38:13 And who is SDF under full control and protection of? Ok and the crude oil? Who are they selling that to?
6857 2018-11-24 23:37:42 Donald Trump is the proverbial snake oil salesman sadly...
6858 2018-11-24 23:37:38 The days of being "Luke Warm" are over Now is the time to have oil in your lamp. Stay sober to truth and watch trusting God in all
6859 2018-11-24 23:37:36 It goes farther back IMHO, to creationism and the denial of dinosaurs, evolution and science, so that a large part of the population learned to do  cognitive dissonance right from childhood. Made them easy prey for the tobacco and oil industries.
6860 2018-11-24 23:37:32 anyway a woman asked me if i was a vegetarian and the conversation ended with her talking to me about oilive oil and my blood type i just,,,,, i dont understand

6870 2018-11-24 23:36:49 Here we go again ! My expression of the year seems appropriate right now , “ CANT FIX STUPID “ how can anyone talk about our oil and criticize it when we have not provided the proper tools to use it in our own country ! This is insane !
6871 2018-11-24 23:36:46 Oh, and if you need a higher fat content, add coconut oil or coconut butter. 
6872 2018-11-24 23:36:27 Oil is more important than moral's
6873 2018-11-24 23:36:21 Coconut oil makes it easier to scrape your kale  from the frying pan into the trash.
6874 2018-11-24 23:36:04 Name a time or place, acutely I'll rub it all with some oil
6875 2018-11-24 23:35:38 Omg I had no other choice but to use vegetable oil. It doesn't even smell digestible. Canola oil too.. sigh
6876 2018-11-24 23:35:21 แปลกก
6877 2018-11-24 23:35:21 Oil plunges 7% to below $51, lowest level in more than a year!
6878 2018-11-24 23:35:20 Can't pre-existing condition, besides trump wont do shit to them bc they are likely paying him off either directly or by artificially lowering the price of oil. And there is something we can do to Saudi for this. Something we should do. WE SHOULD IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THOSE TYRANTS

6884 2018-11-24 23:34:45 The previous administration funneled a billion dollars to al-Qaeda affiliates and ISIS  in the name of regime change in Syria, why? Because there was money to be made. See Golan Heights and illegal oil sales. Yet, people still quip the right, but nary a whisper of the left. Pshhh
6885 2018-11-24 23:34:37 The problem is, you can't just stop pumping oil as it ruins the Reservoir if you just shut it down. We can slow down bringing new capacity on line, but we can't just shut down existing, producing oil wells without damaging them.
6886 2018-11-24 23:34:32 The real crisis that will be remembered by future generations is the climate crisis, not another oil crisis in this boom-bust sector.

6890 2018-11-24 23:34:22 Appreciate your direction in regards to lobbying but as mentioned almost all environmental groups are NFP so not much money. So OK, you’re right  Green groups lobby, but their funding is $billions$ below oil, coal, mining etc etc etc major difference and far less influence.
6891 2018-11-24 23:34:08 I’m about to get my first oil change and I don’t like all this adulting I’m having to do
6892 2018-11-24 23:34:08 it’s fucked, I had no oil in it and they went that fast. There’s no way

6899 2018-11-24 23:33:24 At the bottom of the letter you’ll notice it’s from Spectrum Health, owned by Richard and Betsy Devos. The Devos’ register their ten mega-yachts in the Cayman Islands to evade taxes. That $10,000 could be enough for an oil change or two.

6902 2018-11-24 23:33:17 Sorry $AAPL has an excess inventory problem which could take 2 quarters to clear up, stock broke weekly uptrend line so now you should expect it to go to monthly uptrend (in the 130s)   Look at the price of crude oil to get an idea of what happens to price in an inventory glut
6903 2018-11-24 23:33:13 That's a small part, his main accomplishment was to let the dogs of production run free.  The US is producing so much that we don't need imported oil and are a net exporter.  Corrupt Barry and his kumbaya alternative energy was sinking us fast, thank God for Trump.
6904 2018-11-24 23:33:07 Been using coconut oil on my skin for some time and whew chileNone of that processed shit either, literally make it myself lol

6908 2018-11-24 23:32:13 The price of oil has come down dramatically in the past couple weeks, its the oil companies ripping everyone off as usual and getting away with it.

6910 2018-11-24 23:32:02 I actually don't know. It was in a bag of lots of different glue sticks. I did find that oiling the seal helped it stay clear. The ones I didn't oil were foggy in the impression.
6911 2018-11-24 23:31:58 Even if land reparations did nothing more than prevent the building of oil infrastructure that would be a huge deal.

Of course there's like a million more reasons why this is important for the environment, but it's your job to google them
6912 2018-11-24 23:31:40 And you think a Scottish Government are going to give oil companies subsidies?
6913 2018-11-24 23:31:36 Ah, I tried diluted neem oil this year. Seemed to do the trick but not much fruit this year, which I read was to be expected following the infestation last year.

6915 2018-11-24 23:31:31 China and India are both moving the bulk of their energy production to solar and wind, respectively.
America is making strides towards renewables as well, despite the Trump administrations tariffs on solar panels
However, the US is still the number one oil producer in the world
6916 2018-11-24 23:31:25 Not really, find a cheaper alternative to oil and the Middle East implodes.

6934 2018-11-24 23:29:18 The president is well aware whatever the dangers of climate the dangers of a new generation of war in the middle east to stop the flow of oil we fought to keep flowing, destabilizing Russia and collapsing the Canadian and Mexican economies while helping China is perhaps worse.
6935 2018-11-24 23:29:14 They could have sold that oil and gas in the EU, got huge benefits in the EU group and be less vulnerable to occasional decreases on the international oil market. They are more on the conservative side when it comes to certain things, just like the Brits are.
6936 2018-11-24 23:29:05 Japan only bombed Hawaii due to America interfering with oil supply, they didn't bomb the mainland as it was too far away , they had absolutely no interest in invasion

6938 2018-11-24 23:28:59 First of all: Any woman should be able to do that as well! Also, nobody should do their own oil change: You need to dispose of the used oil properly and it's a huge mess anyway. (Does that count as "mansplaining"? Cause it wasn't supposed to sound like that!)
6939 2018-11-24 23:28:44 I honestly am so taken aback by that one. And I didn’t even know motor oil looked so much like syrup!

6945 2018-11-24 23:27:59 Alberta spent 40 years spending, to keep from raising taxes. Spent proceeds from oil, spent hertiage Fund, never saved like Norway did, now your rainy day is here, and you whine and want to the rest of Canada to fix it for you.  But when you have the $ coming in you are smug
6946 2018-11-24 23:27:56 How free are you when huge sums of your earning go to the government to be controlled by politicians. My best friend is from Venezuela and came here because of the havoc created when the government took over the Oil companies and bankrupted the economy.
6947 2018-11-24 23:27:56 One thing that actually helped my nails as well when mine got damaged like that was coating them with coconut oil every night! Made them way less brittle and dry, it helped my cuticles as well!

6950 2018-11-24 23:27:25 Are commodities a large enough cost center to really impact inflation today the way they did decades ago

6957 2018-11-24 23:26:46 Funny I don’t remember this being a problem 3-5 yrs ago because the oil corps where making money and paying their OWN way to abandon wells. Now no money and bankrupt they leave them.  Pretty simple

6975 2018-11-24 23:24:56 Just a thought: The Bush family assured that Nazi Germany was financed. Yes, the Bush family got well rewarded for financing Nazis that killed our sons, brothers, daughters, sisters, and fathers.
They became oil magnates from that money. Bush oil money is ILL GOTTEN GAINS.
6976 2018-11-24 23:24:47 Ur green energy isnt green. Its bad for environment n wildlife. Also ur green energy cant exist w/o oil.

6988 2018-11-24 23:22:47 The left needs to stop relying so much on logic and reason and fairness—all worthy but apparently irrelevant to many voters. When Luntz redefines oil drilling as exploration and healthcare reform as a govt coup, we need to push back repeatedly & take charge of the lexicon.

6994 2018-11-24 23:21:57 To be fair, I envision the "Druid Fluid" Munchkin card, which has a blender on it.

I also can't envision a biker druid. Unless it's a druid of oil or metal, which are both natural substances, I guess. So a petrodruid or a ferrodruid.

7005 2018-11-24 23:20:42 If Scotland managed oil the way Norway does making them rich with less oil then it deserves to be front and centre. Comparisons with Norway and their profits should also be front and centre.
7006 2018-11-24 23:20:36 Should they instead steal Syria's oil like the U.S?

7009 2018-11-24 23:20:28 How exactly did a relationship between an aging supporting actor in comedy films and a former oil consultant who inadvertently sparked the Trump Russia investigation start in the first place? I think it's fair to point out that they're an odd pairing.
7010 2018-11-24 23:20:23 Pep is doing documentaries and bantering in press conferences. Gone full GOAT mode. He was allowed to get oil money in big 2018 and the prem thought he wouldn’t cause havoc 
7011 2018-11-24 23:20:17 premium oil change, new air filter and an alignment for $25. take advantage of pretty privilege.
7012 2018-11-24 23:20:16 At the height of Hugo Chavez "socialist" regime he had taken control of all utilities, oil drilling and refineries,  all media outlets,  all TV and radio stations so how were people working for private companies.  It took him 12 years to completely destroy the country.
7013 2018-11-24 23:20:07 Give me strength, Scottish Gov hasn’t got the power as you well know. If we had we would not have Trident. It was only 2days ago they owned up about Oil Wells, before that it was running out. Complaint to WM they have the power, not Holyrood. 
SNP has invested in renewables 
7014 2018-11-24 23:19:46 I’m actually sitting here debating if I have the oil to go this....what is wrong with me...
7015 2018-11-24 23:19:45 That is incredible! I can’t paint with oil but I know how hard it is to use so this is just beyond amazing
7016 2018-11-24 23:19:36 The big Western powers are cutting ties with Saudi Arabia and the media along with the CIA are on this Khashoogi assassination while Trump is trying to label Venezuela a terrorist nation. Only means one thing. The push to get their oil is about to be massive.

One false flag away
7017 2018-11-24 23:19:31 Yea because Justin has set the price of oil.
7018 2018-11-24 23:19:23 Shared this with my students. Did steam distillation of clove oil during the week.

7022 2018-11-24 23:18:47 Actually it was US shale combined with Russian Caspian Sea production.  It was more a Russian-ME fight and shale production suprised a lot of people out of the US.

But remember, not all oil is created equal. A lot of shale is not gas quality but used for other things.

7031 2018-11-24 23:17:39 Andrew Scheer's CPC yell about pipelines but pipelines export oil overseas while also exporting jobs with them. The value added jobs are at the end of the pipe at refineries. CPC rushes oil out of the country to enrich foreign companies short term, impoverishing Canada long term.
7032 2018-11-24 23:17:32 1. Pre-heat the oven to 355 ºF (180 ºC) and grease two 6 inch (15 cm) round cake tins with vegetable oil.

“Yeah he does..” he chuckled softly and reached into the cupboard again and pulled out a bottle of thc oil and put a couple drops under his tongue.

He needed it to stop the twitches in his hands.

7043 2018-11-24 23:16:07 @chrisolave_ excellent game today!! See you at Lucas Oil next week.
7044 2018-11-24 23:15:49 Wonder which has more ethical palm oil? @LidlUK
7045 2018-11-24 23:15:37 ありがとうございます、胃が痛い日々が続きます、
7046 2018-11-24 23:15:21 You can say oil to account enters into the only thing that he thinks psychoanalysis on the uprising and nothin's any distinct
7047 2018-11-24 23:15:11 The blood of Khashoggi is on your hands. Own it. Because millions of us value life over big jobs, money and oil. You will burn in hell for your sins against humanity.
7048 2018-11-24 23:15:00 Need some vitamin e oil.
7049 2018-11-24 23:14:43 You forgot to mention Norway's oil reserves, and its groundbreaking industries eg telecoms (Nokia) etc.

OPEC punished countries that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War in 1973.

Norway wasn't one of them.

7053 2018-11-24 23:14:20 Shadow got an oil change and the tires rotated. We’re ready to hit the road now  might be in your city
7054 2018-11-24 23:14:07 Or maybe a President who actually believes in global warming and will pump money to solar and wind instead of coal and oil.  Just a thought
7055 2018-11-24 23:14:05 Heat up a pot of canola oil to about 250° C and put in the chicken. Fry for about five minutes, turning over each piece until they're golden brown. Take out of pot and set on plate to cool. 

By the way, you've gotten some really shitty translations there. But enjoy the recipe.
7056 2018-11-24 23:13:41 Ah, but they need the oil, salmon, whisky, gin, water, power, Faslane etc etc. It really is that simple or am I mad ? We do continually make the UK establishment look awful and they don't dole out a little extra pocket money to say .... The Midlands.
7057 2018-11-24 23:13:29 I need some oil 
7058 2018-11-24 23:13:28 Apparently you never been to communist China are perhaps Mexico where all the oil industry is ran by the Government. Private sector is accountable to the Government a large Government is not accountable to anyone .

7061 2018-11-24 23:12:59 Hi hope you are well. I successfully run a business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love an opportunity to prove science wrong. When can I provide my service? I would love to do a collaboration with you. Thank you
7062 2018-11-24 23:12:50 The one that had the oil and the flower. She had a little that God increased until the famine was over. God shall supply all our needs according to his riches and glory. We must get the word of God as a treasure chest deep within our hearts.
7063 2018-11-24 23:12:31 Why are oil pastels always included in kids art sets anyway, they’re messy and finicky and hard to use
7064 2018-11-24 23:12:31 Oil?
7065 2018-11-24 23:12:25 さすがガチ勢(*^ーﾟ)b
7066 2018-11-24 23:12:24 And how many has Trudeau managed? Even if Trudeau was a competant leader which he is not nothing would have been completed. The fault lies not with the governments but with lobby groups and foriegn sourced money to block Canadian oil getting to tidewater.
7067 2018-11-24 23:12:23 Today my kid threw a tantrum about soup 6x so I’m pretty much ready to volunteer for an oil change just to leave the house #toddlers #dictators
7068 2018-11-24 23:12:15 Peaking and burning oil like a 2-stroke... Then had an industry gala evening straight after the show, and finally rode home at midnight. Loooong day - but excellent.
7069 2018-11-24 23:12:12 True, but none of them including Norway are truly socialist (they have oil money). A generous welfare state is one thing, although that's tough when you're already asking future generations to pay for all the stuff we want now, but that is not the Marxist socialism of Corbyn.
7070 2018-11-24 23:12:10 Argan oil eco styler gel, or you should definitely try As I Am's curling jelly. It has the same gel-like texture but doesn't make your hair hard at all
7071 2018-11-24 23:12:04 Think you'll find that this isn't a supply problem, it's a barrier to export problem.
Americans are reaping a huge benefit from Alberta oil because we have only one customer. I even heard rumours that US oil interests were backing naive BC pipeline opponents to keep this monopoly
7072 2018-11-24 23:12:01 i need an oil change 
7073 2018-11-24 23:11:53 Oil allow a quick goal in the first and then the entire team will play scared and lose against the worst team in the league.
7074 2018-11-24 23:11:48 He has a point. Harper should have delivered a flying backick to the temple of oil activism and ramrodded the regulatory process until he got his way.
Like the Liberals are doing now.
7075 2018-11-24 23:11:46 Hi hope you are well. I successfully run a business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love an opportunity to prove science wrong. When can I provide my service? I would love to do a collaboration with you. Thank you
7076 2018-11-24 23:11:45 scars are frickin' cool tho, also have you tried bio oil?
7077 2018-11-24 23:11:41 Why quit? Cigarettes are perfectly safe according to the same scientists that say global warming is safe. It probably has nothing to do with the fact that the tobacco and oil companies hired the same PR firms that promote those scientists.
7078 2018-11-24 23:11:24 Raw honey and sugar 
or 
raw honey olive oil and brown sugar.
Just rub it on there for a few mins then rinse with warm water
7079 2018-11-24 23:11:19 Coming home from work and first thing I did was to wash my sneakers with a toothbrush and detergent because a customer got oil on them

7081 2018-11-24 23:11:12 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
7082 2018-11-24 23:11:11 The main ingredient was olive oil.

Drink up, Judah Ben-Hur.
7083 2018-11-24 23:10:50 Fossil fuels aren’t necessarily being subsidized. Processes are, but the end product, oil. Nope.
7084 2018-11-24 23:10:46 Some people just listen to the program that Trumpy is broadcasting and they don't even use the internet to check facts.  Dumbo is saying he gets most of his oil from Saudi - Check the facts.  Canada gives more to your oil.  Just saying.  There is a thing called search.  Use it.
7085 2018-11-24 23:10:37 The candlestick chart looks bearish and I'm not educated on P&F charts. Fundamentally oil is way oversold. So many bullish pieces to the puzzle put together shows oil back at $75 before long. Iran situation is temporary, not long term. We're going to have a shortage, not glut.
7086 2018-11-24 23:10:34 OMG Sevro #JustSaying  #morningstar #redrising @Pierce_Brown haemanthus oil!?

7088 2018-11-24 23:10:29 Does that football have motor oil on it?
7089 2018-11-24 23:10:21 Wait what happen in Syria before expecting oil to fall more : URGENTE: terroristas apoiados pela OTAN atingiram três bairros da cidade síria de Aleppo com armas químicas! 41 civis estão agora em hospitais!
7090 2018-11-24 23:10:13 Omg i loveeee gardenias theyre so lovely and i love putting the essential oil on sometimes! Ahh thank u, u remind me of a baby pink rose

7092 2018-11-24 23:10:11 For any political party to win in those areas they need to have the following as a campaign package
2 litres of cooking oil
4 kgs of sugar
Beans
Tinned beans and beef

With the above guaranteed victory.

With the above Havana basa ne duty or fuel
7093 2018-11-24 23:10:03 Yeah, cause no men have ever died in wars over oil or any other resource.  As well, the same oil and other fossil fuels that turn the turbines that put electricity in your car. Remember that the next time you flip on a light or charge your laptop to type something sanctimonious.
7094 2018-11-24 23:10:01 Another oil spilllll!!!!!!!!!!!
7095 2018-11-24 23:09:45 I’ve literaly smoothered my hair in caster oil 
7096 2018-11-24 23:09:30 Welp... Should of stayed out of the Middle East... Lets not pretend you were trying to install 'democracy'. We know you were there for oil, you stole their stuff and then left it to crumble, having completed your mission. That's the reason they hate you.
7097 2018-11-24 23:09:29 なんやかんやすぐ寝たw
7098 2018-11-24 23:09:29 Well, you repeat the propaganda of the oil/gas industry, but I'm not interested in it. Have a nice day, may knowledge about modern technology arrive one day along our 3rd world internet even to your home.
7099 2018-11-24 23:09:16 音けっと行きたいからイベント準備がんばりまーす
7100 2018-11-24 23:09:15 Same applies to mulims also. Go and check how many are working in US and UK and many are waiting to get refugee there. And US is scared of Iran is a laughing claim. . Iran is not creating oil, it is available and they are selling it.

Don’t say it
Don’t say it
Don’t say it
Don’t say it

7107 2018-11-24 23:08:54 took a shot at oil for a bounce

7109 2018-11-24 23:08:50 Well, it's a piss poor life when the ladies fire you up
And then you check their oil and know you're fucked

7111 2018-11-24 23:08:28 If there was a viable alternative to oil, this would have happened.
7112 2018-11-24 23:08:26 This story is subscribers only. It is worth a read if you have oil and gas wells on your property. The online story has lots of graphics and pictures but at the very least buy a paper for a couple bucks and read it if you like
7113 2018-11-24 23:08:24 Oh yes please and we should boycott their oil!  Maybe Alberta wont look so much like the ugly cousin in the family!
7114 2018-11-24 23:08:17 Q: How do you make a little money in oil. 
A: By starting with huge taxpayer subsidies.
7115 2018-11-24 23:08:15 slobbing on some Saudis kabob perhaps? between the sheets playing drill my oil well with a sheikh? i swear he is the embodiment of every evil bottom in mainstream movies that portray us homos in a bad light. he makes my skin crawl.
7116 2018-11-24 23:08:12 Oil or no oil from Saudi Arabia wouldn’t affect the economy as much as Trump says. We get... what, 9%? of our oil from them, oh boy what a tragedy it would be to sanction MBS. The profits gained for weapons sales also aren’t as much as Trump says. See the pattern here?
7117 2018-11-24 23:08:01 I guess a substantial amount of junk bonds supports the shake oil industry.
7118 2018-11-24 23:07:43 PS: rates are on the rise too. What will happen to rates when China sells US debt for gold or oil or some other commodity and the market is saturated with debt? Chances are Fed buys the debt to control rates, but where do those dollars go?
7119 2018-11-24 23:07:43 Scotland has a shite load of oil for the uk tae peg their dodgy Wonga loan on to!
7120 2018-11-24 23:07:35 Pro tip: DONT EVER TAKE A BATH WITH PEPPERMINT ESSENTIAL OIL YOU WILL FEEL EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE
7121 2018-11-24 23:07:30 Yeah lets get doctors in the political mess this nation is in.
But why not because the top three most profitable business in america are; 
Healthcare
Education
Oil
7122 2018-11-24 23:07:28 本当はダメ
7123 2018-11-24 23:07:20 Went to Prince Edward County. Stayed in a quaint motel. Got addicted to the complimentary bottle of body oil. It retails for $70. I got over my addiction.
7124 2018-11-24 23:07:17 I use it with oil, when I use it, (sometimes with 'smoke',  )
7125 2018-11-24 23:07:08 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
7126 2018-11-24 23:07:01 だめだよ
7127 2018-11-24 23:06:54 Hot baby oil
7128 2018-11-24 23:06:47 Keep that in mind with glut oil
7129 2018-11-24 23:06:46 寝坊なんだよなー (車で行けば余裕)
7130 2018-11-24 23:06:44 Yeah. In any way, I wouldn't mind helping those oil patch workers get the skills needed to find suitable jobs in the green energy sector and other sectors, just like how a lot of former coal miners have become computer programmers.
7131 2018-11-24 23:06:31 Yup, it's oil paint! And thank you so much 
7132 2018-11-24 23:06:29 Was in a bike shop in central on Friday to borrow a spanner and a guy came in with a sticking d-lock. He asked them for some "oil" and they handed him some chain wax! He was just about to dump loads in there before I stopped him! Suggested some silicone lube instead. 
7133 2018-11-24 23:06:13 This is Scottish oil, please correct this promoted tweet before independence day.
7134 2018-11-24 23:06:10 オハヨー
7135 2018-11-24 23:05:56 He's shite, the turning circle of an oil tanker and the pace of Stephen hawking with a flat battery.
7136 2018-11-24 23:05:51 Vaseline and then slide them off or baby oil
7137 2018-11-24 23:05:46 Fed, mixed in with global oil glut.  Stick to healthcare.
7138 2018-11-24 23:05:44 I need that sit wit my while I deep condition kinda love ... that grab my jojoba oil kinda love.... that hold this part right here kinda love 
7139 2018-11-24 23:05:43 Cheers. There is a time lag, due to oil and resource logistics, but if my analysis is correct the the dollar will follow oil down.
7140 2018-11-24 23:05:41 Every day massage feet with coconut oil. Before sleeping. Hope fully it might helps me
Wear socks after oil.
7141 2018-11-24 23:05:40 So, I need to tour 53 countries? Have you been to all 53 Muslims coutries? Let me tell you only few countries with natural resources (oil) are rich and you can do a simple Google with top 10 poor countries and  out of  this 8 Muslim majority.
7142 2018-11-24 23:05:32 Well... that just tempts me to go get and try some of that oil now.
7143 2018-11-24 23:05:32 They are backed by an oil rich nation even the likes of Abramovic can't compete with that. We've just got to forget about them and concentrate on ourselves
7144 2018-11-24 23:05:25 This hasn't registered with the "it's Scotland's oil" crowd at all. Such a blind spot for those who call themselves progressive. 
7145 2018-11-24 23:05:18 Coconut oil is good
7146 2018-11-24 23:05:12 noooo one of the cops tried to change my oil a few weeks and they couldn’t find it
7147 2018-11-24 23:05:04 Discovering oil ain't a bad idea. More riches niyen
7148 2018-11-24 23:05:02 Until the palm oil industry is completely sustainable, and causes no harm to living beings, it will never be acceptable as an ingredient in any food I prepare.
7149 2018-11-24 23:04:48 Just wondering why a cheaper grade of refined oil, such as diesel, which for 50 years was less expensive at the pump than regular, now costs 40% more? #diesel #cheap #dumb
7150 2018-11-24 23:04:46 The motor oil on pancakes 
7151 2018-11-24 23:04:39 there’s thc oil pods bro
7152 2018-11-24 23:04:28 They better give me motor oil on my pancakes or I’ll be sad
7153 2018-11-24 23:04:24 I have minimised the campaign on #JusticeforOmolola to champion far greater cause #JusticeforWidows #EndWidowAbuse #ReformProbateLaws. No amount of politicised rice and oil will take care of the needs of widows. We must help them fight for their rights which includes inheritance.
7154 2018-11-24 23:04:20 DJT will take out the federal reserve system. Restore the creation of our monetary supply to congress as the constitution requires. We have a huge problem with the dollar based oil trade. Trump will fix this.
7155 2018-11-24 23:04:18 The Lord can, but CBD, hemp oil and propolis tincture can reduce the tumor or remove it. Plants and bee product made by God.
7156 2018-11-24 23:04:16 @cindymccain @MeghanMcCain @TIME my advice for both of U:Don't open your filthy mouth unnecessarily. V R trying to forget the frustration towards ur loser husband. Don't add  more fire and oil to the burning soul of ur rotten old man. Hell is not fun even for a traitor like him.
7157 2018-11-24 23:04:11 MOTOR OIL.
7158 2018-11-24 23:04:05 “If you would put as much money on your car than you do on make-up, you wouldn’t have problems”

Me - “make up will never need an oil change”
7159 2018-11-24 23:04:04 The oil over the pancakes too!  Like what?!?
7160 2018-11-24 23:03:56 I was speculating on what Bella Caledonia was aiming at with his oil is bad line. Who knows?
7161 2018-11-24 23:03:47 I treated my car to some good oil today lol.

7166 2018-11-24 23:03:08 some of us are more oil than blood/ more oil than water/ more gasoline than rainbow/
7167 2018-11-24 23:03:04 Democrats take house, fed raises rates, oil prices drop, but there is still an insane insistence to blame our president ... smh
7168 2018-11-24 23:03:03 Fascinating analysis, Alan, this is a great illustration of what we are promoting WFPB #plantbased diet vs. the typical oil heavy "mediterranean" diet that is promoted. Over double the fiber and protein, half the fat content. Everything works out better in the end.
7169 2018-11-24 23:03:00 They biggest oil their contributions would be so large.
7170 2018-11-24 23:02:45 I side with some of them but definitely not Adam, he literally has no likable qualitys with his only arc being obbsesed with Blake
7171 2018-11-24 23:02:45 What happens if they are not approved for asylum in US? Mexico will send them back? I lived in Mexico for 3 years. They are hard working people. But fact is,being oil rich they really need not be a 3rd world country. I don't know if it's the government system or corruption.
7172 2018-11-24 23:02:32 But you, when fasting, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that you may not appear to be fasting to men but only to your Father who is in secret. Then your Father who looks on in secret will repay you. - Matthew 6:17-18

7175 2018-11-24 23:02:03 if your laundry:
- is really heavy
- wont fit in the laundry basket
- is 2 feet tall
- smells like oil
-has a nodular iron crankshaft
-has a Cast iron block with 6-bolt, and cross-bolted main caps

that's not your laundry, its a Chevrolet L96 Gen-IV Small-Block V-8 engine.
7176 2018-11-24 23:01:58 If you want three times the price of oil and an hour's queue at the gas station, go against Trump. If you don't want to, shut up!
7177 2018-11-24 23:01:48 doing my first oil pastel drawing and im in love with oil pastels!!!
7178 2018-11-24 23:01:47 @and1_grant Please look into CBD oil and Medical Marijuana to help fight you cancer. It may help. God speed.
7179 2018-11-24 23:01:44 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if you're frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.

7185 2018-11-24 23:01:08 I'll never forget that disrespectful wave he gave Arsene when he was City boss. Thought he was Billy big bollocks with all the Oil money behind him. 
7186 2018-11-24 23:01:04 cooked bacon and oil came flying to my eye.  but i cannot wait to eat 
7187 2018-11-24 23:00:34 Just put everything on your hair and wait ! Also you can use some products to keep your hair healthy, so that your hair will keep the color longer ! I rec you coconut oil ~
7188 2018-11-24 23:00:30 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
7189 2018-11-24 23:00:23 Yes. As a wee lad I clearly remember thinking “damn, these people like winning 6 games a year so long as their offense is raiding the air and they make the Dec. 26th Midas Oil and Blue Apron at Fairfax Inn Bowl
7190 2018-11-24 23:00:03 This might be the best I’ve ever smelled. 

I used an Arabian oil that I got from Dubai then layered it with a different perfume on top and the combination is just winning

7194 2018-11-24 22:59:43 @JordanStax I think the motor oil surprised me the most.
7195 2018-11-24 22:59:33 Obligatory camera pan to Noel Gallagher at the City game. I’m glad they’ve bought flamboyant success with tyrant’s oil money for him now because he’s not had a lot of luck in life #MOTD
7196 2018-11-24 22:59:25 Swim in coconut oil?
7197 2018-11-24 22:59:13 It might be more useful if you share the petition that actually addresses the palm oil issue, not just a petition to show an advert on TV.
7198 2018-11-24 22:59:00 But oil companies are more important than humanity.
7199 2018-11-24 22:58:48 No we’re leaving the industry with no other choice but to go bankrupt because were too stupid to build a fucking pipeline to the coast where the rest of the world is selling the Oil for $50 a barrel and we’re selling for 14.
7200 2018-11-24 22:58:48 If you want three times the price of oil and an hour's queue at the gas station, go against Trump. If you don't want to, shut up!
7201 2018-11-24 22:58:46 My local recycling centre takes cooking oil, so I store it in a plastic bottle (once cool) and periodically drop it off there,
7202 2018-11-24 22:58:28 Tech, tourism, agriculture, mining, forestry and oil. We will be fine once we stop sending billions east. Nice chatting Ben.
7203 2018-11-24 22:58:22 Must you tweet,what brought oil here? Fulani people and oil
7204 2018-11-24 22:58:21 A trillion barrels? As in, over 10 times the total oil discovered on the UKCS before? I find it a bit unrealistic.
7205 2018-11-24 22:58:20 Hasbunallah! May Allah come to your aid Sir.

7207 2018-11-24 22:58:17 I've always said that when the #oil companies get done with #Alberta we'll be left with a smoking hole in the ground unfit for habitation.
7208 2018-11-24 22:58:00 That does not mean they have a production license or that they will ever get one you dumb fuck. So when the EWT ends so does the temporary test flow sales. It is not oil production it is sales of test flows. You silly fucker #UKOG #OHFUckingDear.
7209 2018-11-24 22:57:46 The guy at the end  
“Give me all the coconut oil” - You and me, both  
7210 2018-11-24 22:57:23 And they should protest! Taxes collected do nothing to stop the companies who are major polluters. Tax them FORCE them to reduce! They will increase their product prices, so we can choose. EG. Plastic water bottles(oil by-product) huge polluter..before and after! Get it???
7211 2018-11-24 22:57:21 yes please do block me so I don't have to see any more of your pro-whore white-knighting or your snake oil scams that prey on impressionable young men
7212 2018-11-24 22:57:19 The Alabama coach pats 21 when he attempts to take someone’s head off.   Take him out of the game
7213 2018-11-24 22:57:10 We only get 11% of our oil from SA. I suspect we can buy that from someone else. Cut them loose.
7214 2018-11-24 22:57:06 Trump is right regarding Saudi Arabia. We need to stand with them due to the price of oil and their help with Iran and Israel
7215 2018-11-24 22:57:05 I make my Asian with garlic pepper paste with soy and sesame oil instead of butter. I use the Asian trail mix and wasabi almonds. It’s amazing.
7216 2018-11-24 22:57:00 We change our oil every day
7217 2018-11-24 22:56:58 True, we weren’t hard enough on SA because of oil prices! But then again look what’s going on in France?
7218 2018-11-24 22:56:22 What oil prices in particular are you referring to?
7219 2018-11-24 22:56:17 You know why he wont. It was what we were warned about. Big Coal and oil corporate lobbyists controlling our political system with kickbacks and campaign donations. Obama warned us this would happen with Citizens United. No one listened.
7220 2018-11-24 22:56:14 My feelings also, I go on about them taking 92% etc but the fact their very first reaction to its discovery was to hide it from us, then they lied about the amount, then voted to take 92% based on population.
A deal England would never accept for itself if it had oil.
7221 2018-11-24 22:56:12 We introduced a Spanish couple to crumpets and now they drizzle them in extra virgin olive oil...

7224 2018-11-24 22:55:59 To heck with it all! Who cares, as long as we get our oil drilling, forest mining, and other earth ravages we can get by with to fill our pockets today! 
7225 2018-11-24 22:55:58 What are the health benefits to drinking olive oil? @SeloSlav
7226 2018-11-24 22:55:53 Democratic policies wrecked havoc to the US economy (avg. GDP circa 2%)- now on the mend since Republicans and the President have pursued policies (less regulations, tax cuts, greater oil and gas exploration and productn ) which have lead to a much greater GDP 3% + a real number!
7227 2018-11-24 22:55:42 Coconut oil clear your skin up
7228 2018-11-24 22:55:37 OPEC is nothing but a cartel that try’s to control the world buy the price of oil 
7229 2018-11-24 22:55:23 no, it´s easy with latex oil
7230 2018-11-24 22:55:19 That’s the same way I feel I don’t plan on ever giving up. The way that the US and Chinese stock market along with oil prices have been falling I honestly trust all my money in crypto more anyday. If we’re heading for a recession then XRP will be our savior long term.
7231 2018-11-24 22:55:17 We sell the most weapons of all countries throughout the world? Why? So all thes countries can build up their arsenals to attack us for invading all their countries to steal their oil? Attacking causes hatred and revenge to us. We sell them the weapons. Common ppl don’t want this
7232 2018-11-24 22:55:04 Agree entirely! How come Canadian oil is selling at such a low price while the world oil price is so high! How can anyone so foolish as not to improve the oil sector in Canad?

7256 2018-11-24 22:51:28 2 people twice the energy efficiency. 
5 families.  5x. It can and it does work.  Clean fuel options increase the benefits.  While no elixir, conservation are steps we can all take as we develop better alternatives.  We are 8% of the world using 30% of the world's oil supply.

7260 2018-11-24 22:51:08 Extremely relevant question. 
Just read Max Siollun's book (Oil, politics&violence), the ff quotes are from it:
 Tafawa Balewa said that Nigeria “existed as one country only on paper. It is still far from being united. Nigerian unity is only a British intention for the country.”
7261 2018-11-24 22:51:04 just saw a pancake commercial and thought about them pouring motor oil on it instead of syrup because of that twitter video

7266 2018-11-24 22:50:40 The oil companies know that their product is finite and it's becoming more and more impractical to obtain. They have the money, so why are they not getting in on the bottom floor of newer renewable energies? Transition right into solar and wind.
7267 2018-11-24 22:50:26 Corrupt politicians in the pay of oil industry. Citizens should seize control of the State, force the oil industry to pay for the clean up, stop all tar sands extraction, stop all oil pipelines. #Alberta #corruption #tarsands

7273 2018-11-24 22:49:59 All that ever happened today was a warm dousing in coconut oil, a lamenting gaze outside of my window where the snow is so white it burns, and the tunes of one of my favorite Japanese band: Toe. Lift off. Three nights to go. Tonight is my first goodbye.

Started using this and though I don’t have uneven tone etc i found it great as a mild face oil that served the purpose of moisturizing minus all the chemicals i like to avoid in creams etc
7317 2018-11-24 22:45:41 Oh, that's just great.  They've earned the "STUPID COLLEGE" Award for 6 years with that one.

7330 2018-11-24 22:44:30 ぽはやう！
7331 2018-11-24 22:44:25 Why oil and traditional cleanse?
7332 2018-11-24 22:44:24 素晴らしい早起き。これは昼寝フラグですね
7333 2018-11-24 22:44:22 My ex-boyfriend’s mother used to bring us 5-gallon jugs of vegetable oil and large economy-sized bottles of Softsoap.  I think she thought we had much more interesting...proclivities than we really did.
7334 2018-11-24 22:44:15 Also, oil change, new winter wiper blades, car wash and vacuuming. Next week: alignment, then I think we're done for a while with car stuff.
7335 2018-11-24 22:44:08 Canoed thru the tarsands area first in 1974. They're not oil sands. Its toffee crossed with molasses & an oily sheen streaming from it into the Athabasca River. We used to take the ph of the water on the Churchill River to the east. It's slowly acidifying. Slow death year by year
7336 2018-11-24 22:44:04 おるたそさんぽはよ
7337 2018-11-24 22:43:59 It’s fine if you wanna have a photo shoot in the gym, but wipe your fucking baby oil off of all the dumbbells please 
7338 2018-11-24 22:43:51 おうちただいました…安室ちゃんガンガンに流れてるリビング……イヤホンして少年団聴くワタシ…
7339 2018-11-24 22:43:50 Oh hai beautiful 
7340 2018-11-24 22:43:49 ぽはよ！
7341 2018-11-24 22:43:48 I use concentrates (Hashish or hash oil) exclusively. I do that just because the buds are NOT consistent, and cannot provide constant relief. Also buds are generally quite more expensive than concentrates.
1 gram of hash oil takes almost 6 grams of buds, or 1.25 grams of hashish
7342 2018-11-24 22:43:33 Don't Forget to Moisturize!!! Your skin is like a fish and needs water to live. Without enough moisture, the skin cells dehydrate and skin produces extra oil to compensate causing wrinkles and acne.
7343 2018-11-24 22:43:28 But not a freaking cent to help get oil out of this province!
7344 2018-11-24 22:43:26 She’s anchored to oil Cos & Wall Street. She was late to back BLM,  & won’t commit to ending drug wars or private 4-profit prisons. Not far enough on HC, Ed , the environment, unions, or infrastructure. Try to wean off HRC & contribute to the FUTURE. Bitterness helps no one.
7345 2018-11-24 22:43:26 While we sit back and pay the extortionate prices while the price of oil per barrel goes down
7346 2018-11-24 22:43:24 Lmao facts! Oil changes always been between $20 to $40
7347 2018-11-24 22:43:23 ぽきた
7348 2018-11-24 22:43:16 Using Venezuela to respond?Please.ANY working brain in the entire PLANET already KNOWS of the non stop attacks against that country JUST because it has the LARGEST OIL RESERVE IN THE WORLD. So,the US+allies+main stream media+more brainless...go along with it. THINK for a change.
7349 2018-11-24 22:43:13 My stupid fucking dumb ass coworker threw away four glass vases, a full jug of water, and my cuticle oil and every chick fil a meal he has from now on is going straight in the trash when I see it from now on.
7350 2018-11-24 22:43:11 Human Cell+Fungal Cell the Fungal Cell can dominate
AB+#gmos+OH+SAD for years feeding the Fungus.
I get Jock Itch overnight for no reason! (more aggressive Rx)
It happens around my rectum also. 
I had a fungal biofilm covering my scrotum+penis--I was unaware
until coconut oil.
7351 2018-11-24 22:43:05 And hair and nose and mouth and...
7352 2018-11-24 22:43:04 夢はどうしようもないよね、おはようございます
7353 2018-11-24 22:42:52 IM NOT ALLOWED TO BURN CANDLES EITHER CAUSE IM GONNA “burn the house down” BUT LIKE OIL DIFFUSERS ARE AMAZING
7354 2018-11-24 22:42:51 I thought my fear of cats would make that more obvious. 
7355 2018-11-24 22:42:47 Sounds crazy but put more oil into it. Don’t use too much mattifying/drying products. My face is the same way.
7356 2018-11-24 22:42:44 42m bbls of Dec open interest in Shanghai Oil contract & escalating geopolitical tensions suggest otherwise.
7357 2018-11-24 22:42:39 ... Port Activities; distributing 20 BLN USD for Investments into Electronics Industry; distributing 20 BLN USD for Investments into Ghana Oil and Gold Reserves; distributing 40 BLN USD for Investments into Ghana Space Program, developing Robotics and Ship Building Industry. ...
7358 2018-11-24 22:42:38 i take nobody doing oil changes this late in the day right
7359 2018-11-24 22:42:38 My issue is if you can't turn a profit you can't be in business. The guy who changes my oil provides a valuable service to me. I can't remember the last time I bought a newspaper or magazine so why should my tax dollars go to them?
7360 2018-11-24 22:42:34 Cbd oil! 
7361 2018-11-24 22:42:31 Lol. Where is all the oil money? It will be embezzled as usual.
7362 2018-11-24 22:42:06 Step 1

Determine the address of [Insert Oil Corp] CEO/COO/CFO/BM

Step 2

In the middle of the night, drag them onto their beautifully manicured lawn.

Step 3

Break their fucking jaw

Step 4

Read off a list of charges. Included should be "Crimes against humanity" and "ecocide"
7363 2018-11-24 22:42:05 It was a huge stupid mistake on his part! You should have been there first!
7364 2018-11-24 22:42:01 They’re using the olive oil I use on #finaltable 
7365 2018-11-24 22:41:54 They must have dipped the ball in canola oil.
7366 2018-11-24 22:41:52 I spilled jasmine oil all over myself. help!
7367 2018-11-24 22:41:49 Remember when oil was like $130 a barrel and new skyscrapers were popping up all over the place across Houston? Those were the days...
7368 2018-11-24 22:41:38 i gently dab peppermint oil on your forehead
7369 2018-11-24 22:41:19 They are attempting to please all Canadians,  but not at the same time. Oil prices are not dictated by Canada
7370 2018-11-24 22:41:14 今日も安定の悪夢
7371 2018-11-24 22:41:10 Eh
Brother david 
It is not me, you will tempt ooo
The bible says 'flee from temptation'
You better come let's use cane and olive oil to deliver you..
7372 2018-11-24 22:41:08 Baby oil
7373 2018-11-24 22:40:58 Girl!! Your eyelashes are looking fuller. I love it! 
7374 2018-11-24 22:40:57 Omg I was just looking at cbd oil for theses cramps 
7375 2018-11-24 22:40:48 Oil will hit 40$ by December 2nd
7376 2018-11-24 22:40:38 I doubt they were Democrats,  or they'd be intelligent enough to know gas is at a 4 year high, that oil prices are set by OPEC, and that Trump's sanctions on Iran are increasing oil prices. 

I suspect there were no democrats,  but just little voices in your head.

#oilprices
7377 2018-11-24 22:40:23 おにーさんにまかせとけー！
7378 2018-11-24 22:40:12 Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and countless suppliers of military hardware is the reason Trump is standing by SA. Only dimwits keep harping about oil. China, Russia, NoKo all would love to sell weapons to Saudis. How great an idea is that if Trump let Putin arm Saudi Arabia
7379 2018-11-24 22:40:05 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
7380 2018-11-24 22:39:58 My suggestion would be :

1. Micellar water (garnier pin- no alcohol & no mineral oil)
2. Low pH cleanser
3. Hydrating toner
4. Moisturizer (no alcohol)
5. Sunblock (no alcohol)

Basic skincare routine should be enough.
7381 2018-11-24 22:39:58 Nice 1.5lb pork roast with Himalayan salt rubbed into it sitting in the fridge until tomorrow! Then I'll boil it with ginger and onion greens, and make a delicious broth out of that with soy sauce, sake, and sesame oil :9
7382 2018-11-24 22:39:54 กินเบียร์กะให้หลับยาว 
ก็ตื่นเช้าอยู่ดี
7383 2018-11-24 22:39:46 Even if this was true, what will it cost the US economy to turn off their 2nd generation industrial (fossil fuel - primarily oil based) economy? Well the invaders from Central America would turn back.
7384 2018-11-24 22:39:40 I fuckin knew you were a dog.
7385 2018-11-24 22:39:34 Which one, shampoo and conditioner or the oil or both? Yes I have a leave in conditioner and there's stylist gel too.

Can I send a DM?
7386 2018-11-24 22:39:34 I need to get up so I can cop this oil change and figure out wtf I’m doing tonight
7387 2018-11-24 22:39:33 1) Oil sands don't figure into this graph. It's by city, not by emissions incurred in Fort Mac etc. 
2) Inre YYC vs TO, this is per capita. I failed to mention that in the original tweet
3) I figure Housing is so high due to sprawl & coal generated electricity. Coal's a killer
7388 2018-11-24 22:39:24 yeah, no influence from the oil lobby in the US... do you hear yourselves?
7389 2018-11-24 22:39:15 I must have missed mine? I’m just trying to afford my heating oil.  You?
7390 2018-11-24 22:39:12 Just a lip oil BUT SHE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW THAT
7391 2018-11-24 22:39:06 I’ve been cleaning my system out for 3 days castor oil and digestive medicinal tea.
7392 2018-11-24 22:38:59 Pumpkin pies: Baked.
Turkey: In the oven, smelling delicious baking in all the salt, pepper, basil, rosemary, thyme, olive oil and lemon I slathered it in yesterday.

Me: Hungry, salivating, reading a good book.
7393 2018-11-24 22:38:58 Nah,yur to old to be a Twink,so hairless is not a good option, unless you're into having guys rub your smooth body all over with oil or gold paint or something like that ʕ◉ᴥ◉ʔ
7394 2018-11-24 22:38:49 Sure enough! SA oil makes up about 11% of the oil we use in this country. We get much more from Canada and look how he treats them.
7395 2018-11-24 22:38:38 I would rather drink fuel oil.
7396 2018-11-24 22:38:38 Oil
7397 2018-11-24 22:38:37 taxes
healthcare
oil
politics
Enron
$aprn
the entire penny stock market
dairy industry
prescription drugs
predatory lending

I mean....
7398 2018-11-24 22:38:37 $19.99 for synthetic oil? 
7399 2018-11-24 22:38:35 New bath bomb we released is *awesome*, the oudh oil is kind of a little... well, ppl love it or hate it but I *love* it. makes this luscious milky lavender water. i wanna buy like, 3 bc I have terrible self control LOL
7400 2018-11-24 22:38:26 I’ve heard the coconut oil is actually not the greatest for the skin on your face, because it’s a heavier substance but there are oils like jojoba that just neutralize your skin, you can even add other oils to those such as tea tree. But yeah worth looking into!! Hope it helps
7401 2018-11-24 22:38:17 @JustinTrudeau needs to work harder to wean AB off of oil.
7402 2018-11-24 22:38:14 Who do you think you’re kidding McGorgeous Face????
7403 2018-11-24 22:38:07 Hotdog in oil > hotdog in water
7404 2018-11-24 22:38:05 She ain't no oil painting that's for sure 
7405 2018-11-24 22:38:02 Legendary snake oil salesman
7406 2018-11-24 22:37:43 Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by the Saudis and Trump thanks them for low oil prices! What a disgusting display of moral bankruptcy! And he’s the President of the United States ?
7407 2018-11-24 22:37:10 hard pill to swallow: fish oil
7408 2018-11-24 22:36:52 
7409 2018-11-24 22:36:46 Lagos is Nigeria's oil money laundering capital
7410 2018-11-24 22:36:43 It’s not the makeup! I’ve seen you without it!
7411 2018-11-24 22:36:22 “Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the #prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.” James 5
7412 2018-11-24 22:36:17 It's an oil type substance you inject into the arm. It's like a fake booty, but in the arm.
7413 2018-11-24 22:36:17 What is being overshadowed by this capitalistic screen is the lack of realizing just how out of touch this nut is when it comes to the people per se. Capitalism and democracy do not mix....like oil and water.
7414 2018-11-24 22:36:16 That will never happen too much oil down there
7415 2018-11-24 22:36:16 やはり難しいものなんですかの～。
7416 2018-11-24 22:36:00 Advice from the Oil lobby.
7417 2018-11-24 22:35:59 You can google it.  They released 2,000 pages the day he was sentenced.
7418 2018-11-24 22:35:53 You right, very unconventional.  Keep in mind that there is not intention to become a world dominant, it is about making a better world far all.  Free oil transport is a gigantic task that requires the contribution of new and existing car manufactures. Tesla investor since 2013.
7419 2018-11-24 22:35:50 Duvido que vc, com essa cara de trouxa, já ouviu falar em Rush, The Who, Midnight Oil, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Lenny Kravitz. Vai ouvir sertanejo, que é mais sua praia. Velho e idiota 
7420 2018-11-24 22:35:29 We need to work closely with indigenous leaders to get oil infrastructure done in an environmentally acceptable way. The oil industry should be making every effort to reach out
7421 2018-11-24 22:35:16 I should’ve got my oil changed earlyy morning, I’ve been sitting here for a minute
7422 2018-11-24 22:35:08 Was gonna say brownies FTW.  Easily packaged and minimal fuss.  Also easily switched out for vegan if you use coconut oil instead of butter and cornflour instead of eggs 
7423 2018-11-24 22:34:59 Speaking as a man from Surrey i say Scotland can't be independent anyway because you know. ..Spain and you won't even be independent because EU so.. you can't afford it anyway you poor stupid little scot but you should totally stay with us though because ww2 and we need oil.
7424 2018-11-24 22:34:51 Great pic Cher!
7425 2018-11-24 22:34:48 I have to buy new tires before winter and get a oil Change ASAP.
7426 2018-11-24 22:34:36 Government shouldn’t be trying to make coal, oil and natural gas more expensive. If anything, they should be working to make them more affordable. More energy = less poverty.
7427 2018-11-24 22:34:19 I’ll take two , please.
7428 2018-11-24 22:33:55 Upson better than Blizzard, but it’s like cod liver oil vs suppository.
7429 2018-11-24 22:33:42 おいる三郎さん、ありがとうございます
ゆっくり休みます
7430 2018-11-24 22:33:40 Picked up a head and oil spilled all over my fresh white laces. And my jeans
7431 2018-11-24 22:33:35 Wow! Just Wow!
7432 2018-11-24 22:33:32 At the best estimate, there are 80,000 people employed in coal/oil/natural gas occupations..

Solar/Wind/Renewable energy employees??

320,000.....

Don't tell me coal jobs are the way to go forward....
7433 2018-11-24 22:33:21 What about DOW, FAANG, oil? Eh?
7434 2018-11-24 22:33:21 My least favorite thing about girls with lash extensions is that when they’re old they’re clumps of lashes just sitting on top of each other. GET SOME COCONUT OIL AND PUT THEM ON YOUR LIDS 
7435 2018-11-24 22:33:19 I just saw your mugg shot at Lucus oil! Haha
7436 2018-11-24 22:33:18 #VASC #Newcastle500 Toyota 86s (Race 2 of 3) carrol and morse come togehter  damage now to carroll lots of smoek he stops exit of turn 1 its oil or something
7437 2018-11-24 22:33:13 Oil pipelines would be absolutely necessary even under full communism. FYI
7438 2018-11-24 22:33:10 will there be a day my face won't just mass produce oil?
7439 2018-11-24 22:33:07 ゆっくり休んでください。
7440 2018-11-24 22:33:06 I bought beard oil for the first time today. I feel like it's just a scam to get men to buy essential oils and rub them on their faces.
7441 2018-11-24 22:33:04 You a SCL/CA were and still are made up almost exclusively of Tory grandees and ex far right leaning ex security service personnel. The Tories were handing out contracts to SCL et al whilst SCL were cosying up a Russian oil firm that is basically a cover for the GRU's activites
7442 2018-11-24 22:33:04 He could just round them up? I doubt Mexico will see much value in economic migrants, having more than ample supply of their own to deal with.
7443 2018-11-24 22:33:00 Pan-seared miso-marinated salmon, arugula with pistachio oil and yuzu, rice with awashi furikake.
7444 2018-11-24 22:32:56 Old simple minded men and oil companies will not be happy till this planet is literally on fire. Complete and utter ignorance
7445 2018-11-24 22:32:53 Ipad pro 2018 on my birthday? 
7446 2018-11-24 22:32:53 It's just as well we voted no, or we we'd never have found all of this oil. The broad shoulders of the UK have managed to find oil when it looked as if it was going to run out the day after independence. 
7447 2018-11-24 22:32:48 Yes Mr. Prime Minister Trudeau Do something GREAT get Canada Off Saudi oil Lets Use our own to fuel our own fire !!!!
7448 2018-11-24 22:32:42 ...It is only the fuel because we have traded our blood for oil and forgot that it isn't black. 

That said, you USE money for the sake of God, when your intention to work is simply for the service. This is a very high state of mind. Money has become a passive element2your life.
7449 2018-11-24 22:32:37 That could be because the glands in your eyelids are not producing enough oil. My retina specialist told me that. He said a warm compress might help loosen things up.
7450 2018-11-24 22:32:30 It’s just so cute how trumpy does the bidding of big oil. They say “Quit the Paris agreement, toad!” and he does.
7451 2018-11-24 22:32:28 This Chi silk press oil & Chi flatirons together is making my hair superrrr soft and wavy
7452 2018-11-24 22:32:17 All they care about in that paper is finances. The futures markets would dry up. Need to plan an immediate change, and invest in environmental solutions so there would be a future to invest in other things for.

One easy way: get fossil oil off the market NOW.
7453 2018-11-24 22:32:13 Carol’s daughter coco creme, Maui moisture coconut oil, curls blueberry bliss, bounce curl, and way more

7455 2018-11-24 22:32:03 No class never had, everyone knew before the oil human rights abusers took over the club what the history of the regime was. Success at any price., shameless.
7456 2018-11-24 22:31:45 @InsidersABC ScoMo the snake oil salesmen can't drive easily through Cronulla
7457 2018-11-24 22:31:38 Actually this is an oil painting my mom did in the 19th century
7458 2018-11-24 22:31:37 You need to moisturize your cuticles.... You don’t have to get fancy, just take a drop of coconut oil or whatever oil you have in the kitchen and dot each cuticle with it....  Rub it in and that’s about it... 
7459 2018-11-24 22:31:25 Some irate asshole jumped the line in front of me at the pharmacy today demanding to know where Kroger kept the “Peppermint seed oil.” And his mood didn’t improve when the pharmacist said there was no such thing.
7460 2018-11-24 22:31:22 Burning the midnight oil. And early morning oil, midday oil, afternoon and evening oil.  All of the oils.
7461 2018-11-24 22:31:21 He represents industry in America who is saying climate change isn't real so they can sell oil and burn coil.which will speed up global warming destroying life on this planet as we know it now.
7462 2018-11-24 22:31:15 30 under 97 working cleverly circa Oil & Energy.
7463 2018-11-24 22:30:47 Cbd oil helps
7464 2018-11-24 22:30:39 @gmbutts Has the government ever considered investing in a high-speed rail line in between Edmonton and Calgary? A large green infrastructure project in the province home to the oil sands would look great for the government. Would give jobs to a lot of unemployed oil workers...
7465 2018-11-24 22:30:39 Hi Shelley, we use fully Supply Chain Certified sustainable palm oil in our products and are a member of the RSPO, leading the way in our field.
7466 2018-11-24 22:30:38 Ppl always ask do we want our parents back together. They were married 13 years together 17 with 5 kids. We like them better separate. We’ve always been a lit ass family tho. They just oil and water

7470 2018-11-24 22:30:01 No one ever said #Trump understood the #oil economy -- and how much WE depend upon it too.
7471 2018-11-24 22:29:57 They were pretty close but then Ohio just started whooping ass
7472 2018-11-24 22:29:55 Just started CBD oil tinctures and love how they make me feel, esp. for the first 4-5 hours after the gym. Makes my knees, feet, ankles, toes feel better and relaxes the body w/o making you high. I'm generally skeptical but endorse CBD oils. It's all about the tincture.
7473 2018-11-24 22:29:51 I’ve been using coconut oil with my moisturizer but that hasn’t been helping lately, I’ve heard great things about rosehip oil tho I’ll def give it a try!
7474 2018-11-24 22:29:36 BlackFriday Would be useful if it was for: 

1. Maize meal 

2. Cooking oil 

3. Depression & anxiety medication 

4. Sanitary pads 

5. School stationery 

6. School uniforms/shoes 

7. Sugar, rice, potatoes 

Not beer, wine or perfumes etc
7475 2018-11-24 22:29:34 I cant stand that style of cooking tbh. if the world is ending I will at least try punjabi food but bengali with their mustard oil and river fish is just not something I can take :)
7476 2018-11-24 22:29:34 Nose- Lavender oil in warm water
Throat- Cold, thick drinks (like milkshakes) and lemon stuff
Tired- Rest, duh
Headache- Rest and plenty of fluids
7477 2018-11-24 22:29:18 Okay now on to the cooking

1. What you want to do first is chop your tomatoes and onions (simple)

2. Then in a medium sized saucepan you want to cook the onions and tomatoes on medium heat (use whatever kind of oil you want)
7478 2018-11-24 22:29:17 I picked the wrong time to get an oil change. Although the dude working on my car cute asf. I’d let him small 
7479 2018-11-24 22:29:06 I find it bizarre that you don’t believe we burn much oil. Evidence to the contrary is literally all around us, driving down streets, flying above us, sitting in giant tanks outside rural houses. Transport is our biggest emitting sector.
7480 2018-11-24 22:29:04 @JustEatUK A cold pizza and 'garlic mushrooms' which are just cold fried mushroom ls16 swimming in oil? What ha0pened?!?!
7481 2018-11-24 22:28:52 Oil that everyone uses in society cannot hold a bid, just imagine these virtual currencies that serve no purpose. Who knows where is the floor for this ?? There will be a floor for BTC but where ?? 1,000 ?? 2,000 ??
7482 2018-11-24 22:28:44 I used too much peppermint oil in my bath lmao hope I don’t die
7483 2018-11-24 22:28:40 @netflix, do not promote Goop, it is snake oil, sold by profiteering quacks at its most benign, but can be extremely harmful when people avoid useful treatments for themselves or worse their children or get into large debt.
7484 2018-11-24 22:28:36 تحصلي زيو ف شولز ولا بصيدلية نورا بجده 

بس الأفضل تشترين جهاز جاكوزي للقدم وكل يوم مساج وحمام حار وبعدها تجففين رجولك وتدهنيهم ب baby Jonson oil النتيجه خياليه
7485 2018-11-24 22:28:36 Algiz on my chest in holy oil every day before i leave the house cause ppl are weird

7487 2018-11-24 22:28:11 The auto shop I go to took good care of me today. A high mileage oil change, a replaced brake light and my car getting vaccumed all for $35.00!
7488 2018-11-24 22:27:46 ですね～。

7489 2018-11-24 22:27:42 Me: “Tom could you find me some Moroccan oil for my hair please?”

Tom: “will olive oil work the same?” 


7490 2018-11-24 22:27:37 No i said predominantly not entirely. Public services in particular. What resources other than oil, even with its volatility, do we have? Another energy firm in the Borders just went bust ffs. Please explain what monetary, economic and immigration policies are 'harming' us?
7491 2018-11-24 22:27:17 The asset stripping of Scotland is now going to be turbo charged the oil field that was never there has now appeared and it's going to pay for brexit like the oil fields in the 70's 80's paid for mass run down of UK industries under Thatcher every it paid for the unemployment etc
7492 2018-11-24 22:27:13 Check out @gikibadges @VaghelaLynn you can scan things and it gives a sustainable Palm oil score based on whether it's segregated supply chain etc. I've found it really useful 
7493 2018-11-24 22:27:04 Marco Navas después del Sevilla pasó x Oil.Ejido,Xerez,Albacete,Guadalajara,Huesca,Elche,Leganés,Recreativo y x un equipo inglés de la 3 div que no se como se llama,ahí le perdí el norte,uno se si siguió jugando o colgó las botas
7494 2018-11-24 22:27:01 I think I’d prefer weidman at 2RD once he has the oil systems figured out so Russell can go back to his left side.  He’d be even more effective at 3LD
7495 2018-11-24 22:26:59 Pink Floyd, Midnight Oil, Guns, U2, mas Blues tbm escuto bastante. Eu adoro música, senão nunca iria opinar sobre o assunto. Ahhhh.... Eric Clapton, tirando Hendrix o melhor guitarrista do mundo 
7496 2018-11-24 22:26:54 Enjoyed that. Two litres of olive oil, oilier but an excellent day. Goodnight. X
7497 2018-11-24 22:26:39 The beer one.

Followed closely by the motor oil one.
7498 2018-11-24 22:26:37 Been pumping oil for a hundred years and got nothing to show for it. What happened to the fat Heritage fund?
7499 2018-11-24 22:26:34 Lagos, Nigeria is nothing without oil money.
7500 2018-11-24 22:26:30 and plunder their oil?
7501 2018-11-24 22:26:25 Less competition for lower cost housing, less school crowding, less stress on county hospitals and local assistance programs.
All around good for Americans who compete for these same resources. #AmericansFirst
7502 2018-11-24 22:25:54 All this selective activism is tiring. Those asking everyone to ditch #DolceGabbana @dolcegabbana China can handle herself. Let’s stop using #oil and solidarize with some real victims instead. 48 decapitations in #ksa in the last 4 months. #unwatch
7503 2018-11-24 22:25:53 Just try seal it up with a some Shea butter that's preferably whisked with coconut oil to make it less heavy. You'll survive!
7504 2018-11-24 22:25:43 I agree with you, but I have this weird trust in Hitch.  Not sure why other than he speaks really well and is a different kind of coach than the oil have ever had, not a players coach at all, I guess we will see
7505 2018-11-24 22:25:39 Poor John will never be found. He was either 
1) called up to heaven by God himself, or 
2) John ended as an old fashioned meat soup:
One missionary man
Olive oil
Yellow onion
Carrots
Celery
Garlic
Dried herbs – basil, oregano, and thyme
Salt and pepper
Red potatoes
7506 2018-11-24 22:25:36 Are you familiar with sarcasm? Deadpan delivery? And seriously Trump is not exactly in charge of oil prices...
7507 2018-11-24 22:25:32 Why do I feel like the oil and gas folks came up with this silliness as a means to bide time to keep drilling/fracking/pumping oil and CNN is dutifully pushing their crazy ideas.
7508 2018-11-24 22:25:29 Turmeric needs to have black pepper, coconut oil and some other ingredients to make it effective
7509 2018-11-24 22:25:17 Even our mediocre dishes are better than pita with olive oil loool, that's like the equivalent of daal
7510 2018-11-24 22:25:15 BTC is digging for crude oil.
7511 2018-11-24 22:25:12 tip!!! mix vitamin E oil directly into your lotion bottle for glowing and hydrated skin
7512 2018-11-24 22:25:07 unable to clean up its messes after years of neglect.."PDVSA's 'messes' are not just oil spills. Their financial 'contamination and pollution' are beyond belief. Cuban control of Vzla. turned what once was one of the top 4 oil conglomerates into the #1 laundering machine.

7515 2018-11-24 22:24:50 In this house you would think a pesto spill causes as much damage as an oil spill. Truly spooky.
7516 2018-11-24 22:24:50 PS. And we were covered in patchouli oil - haha! I'm still rather fond of it. Hope you're having a good weekend, Vanessa.  Jan x
7517 2018-11-24 22:24:45 This poor thing as well as many others have no idea just how much we owe to oil 

Talk about a thinning of the heard cut oil off today
7518 2018-11-24 22:24:44 태양의 시 번역체 너무 심해..한국 동양물인데 번역체라니 너무 치명적인 단점이라 몰입감 떨어져..
7519 2018-11-24 22:24:40 You need those scent sticks you put in scented oil. Ummmmmm. Hang on.
7520 2018-11-24 22:24:32 I'm still devastated over oil of ulay becoming olay
7521 2018-11-24 22:24:19 the cannabis sativa oil eco style gel is actually so bomb 10/10
7522 2018-11-24 22:24:14 I'm for bold green excellent public transport and substantial financial incentives for scientists who figure out a way to run our engines and keep our lights on without coal or oil.
7523 2018-11-24 22:24:12 True . The USA is ramping up production year after year. Russia as well. If canada stops. Other oil producers will simply step in.
7524 2018-11-24 22:24:02 If it wasn’t a secret then why was “Scotland’s oil running out” before ‘discovering’ the largest oil find for generations.
7525 2018-11-24 22:24:01 その通りです～。
頑張りましょ！
7526 2018-11-24 22:23:52 1.) there is genuinely nothing different about your voice hahaha 2.) it wouldn't matter if there was 3.) these are the exact weirdos sitting at home with a box of tissues and some baby oil saying "ahhh what id do to sophie"...ignore em, bunch of weirdos mate...
7527 2018-11-24 22:23:49 Plant don’t depend on us burning oil for nutrients. They made it billions of years without us. Think about it. Your farmer friend is doing non-rotating monoculture and doesn’t give a fig about building soil and sustainably farming. Oil for the tractors and nat gas for fertilizer.
7528 2018-11-24 22:23:44 Why hasn't a single Democrat governor lowered the statewide max speed limit to 55mph?  It happened in the 70s during the oil embargo.  Why not now??? The impact would be immediate.
7529 2018-11-24 22:23:37 I have oily skin & lately I been dry af ! My makeup isn’t coming out how I want it too . How do I get enough oil with out being supper oily but look matte ?
7530 2018-11-24 22:23:33 Nutella is the love of my life so to learn that it contains palm oil had broken me in ways no one will understand
7531 2018-11-24 22:23:32 サマ推しのいちろ~はサマと出会うことによって世界が輝いたのでサマを推してるだけで充分HAPPYなんだけどサマはいちろ~のことが好きだし関係を持って深めたいしキスだってセックスだってしたいっておもってる
7532 2018-11-24 22:23:18 “Typically, a barrel of crude oil processed in the UK will yield: 30% petrol, 25% diesel, 13% gas oil, 9% jet fuel, 9% fuel oil (heavy residue for power generation), 4% LPG, 4% heating oil, 4% naphtha and 2% bitumen.”
7533 2018-11-24 22:22:46 but that's also bc oklahoma is big in the oil and gas industry so
7534 2018-11-24 22:22:44 If the Venezuelan economy had been more diverse then the flooding of the market with cheap oil would not have had the impact.
7535 2018-11-24 22:22:37 @cabana_sun hi, could you tell me the UVA star rating of your cabana sun deep tanning dry oil please?
7536 2018-11-24 22:22:28 That's because he is beholden to the oil companies. Such a crooked person!
7537 2018-11-24 22:22:21 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
7538 2018-11-24 22:22:21 Come to Argentina, it's not that far from Brazil 
7539 2018-11-24 22:22:06 I’ve tried to grow my hair back, but this one little patch just won’t act right. I’ve heard Jamaican Castor Oil helps, any truth to this?
7540 2018-11-24 22:22:04 Well shoot. Trump even watched as a foreign power murdered a man to slash those oil prices too. Now what’s he going to do?!
7541 2018-11-24 22:21:44 Canada provides 40% of US  oil
7542 2018-11-24 22:21:34 Geez ...... it’s getting just a little confusing.. Buy oil its going to $100!.... sell oil, it’s goin to $30.  Buy the Dxy it’s going to 100..... sell the Dxy, it’s about to crash....... . I think I’ll just stay long Gold and Miners.  
7543 2018-11-24 22:21:28 incense or oil diffusers arent a fire hazard i dont think??????
7544 2018-11-24 22:21:24 Guys this morning a car skid through the barrier on the road on to the other side of the road because of all the oil coming up for the rain and it was truly one of the scariest things I’ve seen happen :/ just another reminder to DRIVE CAREFULY OK

7546 2018-11-24 22:21:05 Trump can't lay a finger on MBS unless he wants $100 oil overnight. Even a sniper taking out MBS isn't going to change how that country does business. Trump is more afraid of KSA than KSA should be of Trump. Trump's tweets now sound desperate.

ありがとうございます～！
7548 2018-11-24 22:20:56 I am so sick of the lies being thrown at Canada's oil and gas. Time to fight back against the foreign-funded propaganda. #pipelines #cdnpoli #abpoli
7549 2018-11-24 22:20:56 Last refuge of scoundrel, incompetent, deceitful liers and snake oil salesmen. ..Politics and it's rightful home..The Tory Party...A total De Toxifiction is needed..its a job too big even for Dynorod ..
7550 2018-11-24 22:20:55 I've used it daily, along with CBD oil gummies, going on 18 months, for pain management after 3 neck surgeries in 6 years. It's absolutely NOT addictive, does a tolerable job of managing what had been constant 7-8 level pain. Without legalized weed, it's a life saver...

7553 2018-11-24 22:20:45 Ok, so there are about 3,5 trillion fish in the sea, 970–2,700 billion fish are caught from the wild (of which 450 – 1,000 billion fish are caught to make fishmeal & fish oil) 37–120 billion farmed fish are killed for food. That's c. 147 fish each p.a. or 2.8 per week. Low again
7554 2018-11-24 22:20:42 @NutellaUSA Could you make a palm oil free version of your product?  I'd get on it!
7555 2018-11-24 22:20:38 I got the oil

Did u know he was talking about how bad global warming was buying up oil companies. Him and Barry worked hand in hand.
7558 2018-11-24 22:20:02 The law and order president from the law and order party thinks we owe the murderous kingdom gratitude for selling us their oil?!?!?!.  But the Dam Party wants lawlessness  ?!?!?!    
puhleeeez.
7559 2018-11-24 22:20:02 @Valvoline should be doing 15-minute oil change for $15 on Black Friday. Lots of cars on the road that just drove a long way. Guarantee 15-minute standard oil change or it’s free. I’d be there.

7562 2018-11-24 22:19:46 Troops? This isn’t 1562 buddy. The CIA has already started their campaign. Between collapsing their currency, getting OPEC nations to inc. oil output to drop the price and all of the US taxpayer sponsored propaganda, I think boots on the ground is unnecessary. Don’t you?
7563 2018-11-24 22:19:25 Lather? Oil? Getting some work? I ain’t tryna be thirsty or nun but uuuh...
7564 2018-11-24 22:19:23 Change the ratios. More meat, oil, cheese. Less pasta

7566 2018-11-24 22:19:17 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
7567 2018-11-24 22:19:17 No it's not that the destruction of crypto market causes SPX selloff... they both have topped due to a hawkish Fed and clear liquidity issues. See OIL as well...
7568 2018-11-24 22:19:17 You bitch about oil companies like you don't use them multiple times daily...
7569 2018-11-24 22:19:16 Your friends in CIA who can record almost every telephone call of any muslim in middle east or Afghanistan will have zillions of such records. But they will not annoy you, because they want their citizens to enjoy their oil guzzling cars, and use u as useful idioits against Iran.
7570 2018-11-24 22:19:13 The wreckage of the Amazon rainforests has increased due to Brazil's new president Bolsonaro and his madness. To all my facebook friends and the public around the world, I urge not to buy products with palm oil and go against Bolsonaro.
7571 2018-11-24 22:19:12 Back when I lived in Houston at the end of the oil boom in the early 80’s, I always heard the saying as; “All hat and no herd”.

When did it become;
“All hat and no cows”?

Somehow it just doesn’t carry the same degree of, “eff him, he’s just fronting!”
7572 2018-11-24 22:19:09 So what about rest or your products re Palm oil???

7576 2018-11-24 22:18:25 Remember years ago when they blocked off oil depots and all that? Fuel much be far more expensive now than back then but now nobody does fuck all.

7580 2018-11-24 22:18:13 Why not legalize hemp and use it for oil instead, we have the acreage to support it, and it would cost us less than buying oil from some piece of shit government (theirs and ours). This product has so many uses, we could become self sufficient on so many fronts....
7581 2018-11-24 22:18:11 I wish we’d look at Iceland and Norway as models instead of the US. Norway actually made a public fund with its oil too and now they are one of the richest countries.!We just let corporations siphon it all off.
7582 2018-11-24 22:18:11 TRUMP SAID KISS HIS ASS " WE NEED THE BILLIONS & OIL " PERIOD !
7583 2018-11-24 22:18:02 LFR has responded to many calls for smell of gas in South West Lubbock.  At this time we have determined the smell is Oil Field gas from areas near Lubbock.

7585 2018-11-24 22:17:18 It boggles the mind to understand why companies are so gung ho over the idea of drilling for oil in the arctic, considering that we already have enough oil to fulfill our needs.  The only reason we import/export any oil is for trade with other countries. #Keepitintheground
7586 2018-11-24 22:17:10 to be fair not many have experience with how to pack 20 liters of olive oil
7587 2018-11-24 22:17:03 ...much each owes his master 6 1st 900 gallons of olive oil 7 2nd, how much? 1000 bushels of wheat - he replied "make it 800". [i'm not sure how this works, why that would help the manager who owes money and why that would be smart, nor why they would listen to him]
7588 2018-11-24 22:17:00 the goddamn motor oil on the pancake

7590 2018-11-24 22:16:54 We urgently need that split up. There are many ethnic groups in the oil producing regions that will claim it is their own. South Sudan is a case study for you,if only u know
7591 2018-11-24 22:16:49 I go home for the holidays just so my mom can go through my bag and find my oil pen, confront me about it and then ask to keep my cute pink battery for her oil lmfaoooooo 
7592 2018-11-24 22:16:46 Oil has more uses than just burning it

7600 2018-11-24 22:15:54 Midland I's having an oil and gas hiring event on December 4th. Over 80 companies hiring on the spot for 2019. Retweet to change a life. #sixFigures
7601 2018-11-24 22:15:51 This has everything @SKGov must love:
-Alternative to oil.
-Education of children.
-A means to turn Saskatchewan from being a Canadian laggard to a Canadian leader.
-A vibrant film produced in Regina.
7602 2018-11-24 22:15:49 I put coconut oil in my hair today and my puppy has never loved me this much
7603 2018-11-24 22:15:42 time and again / an avaricious oil baron / a murky past / proactive approach to life / cleavages /
7604 2018-11-24 22:15:41 Oil money bro.
7605 2018-11-24 22:15:33 Fact is that given the US energy production, we are, or should be energy self-sufficient. But energy cartels have created a system where the US exporting, and importing makes more profit. One more time. We don't need Saudi oil.
7606 2018-11-24 22:15:30 Nah, with Oil, pretty sure he will combine chequebook with training/tactics. Considering their forwards almost incomparably more useless compared to other Big Seven(include Bournemouth lmao)'s strikers. It can only be cured with chequebook imo.
7607 2018-11-24 22:15:24 Stop with the Falklands stuff. We stole their oil.
7608 2018-11-24 22:15:18 The only possible logical explanation is Susan gets paid, whenever something just doesn’t make sense and you can find no rational logical explanation, it’s about money, it’s always about money, not the NRA, Big Oil or Pharma, Wall Street perhaps ? This is something to be explored
7609 2018-11-24 22:15:18 I think he is just a moron,  the way he talks he must be getting something from the oil and coal companies .
This is also the same person that said we need to rake forests.
7610 2018-11-24 22:15:01 Now i start buying seriously. What would you buy right now?

7611 2018-11-24 22:14:56 @elonmusk Will you, for the love of defiance against the angry ppl, create a tesla model that more Americans can afford, so that dependence on foreign oil from murderous regions aren't needed? Just wondering. Thank you.
7612 2018-11-24 22:14:52 We get the majority of our oil from Canada, that country Trump spits on daily. Arms dealers and their investors are not high employers. This is about Saudi money in the Trump/Kushner pockets.
7613 2018-11-24 22:14:51 If not for the fact that they can literally buy anyone I would say they might be in trouble. The only way trouble comes is if they get a FFP charge or FIFA comes at them. Unfortunately i don't thing FIFA can compete with oil money in a fair way
7614 2018-11-24 22:14:51 Continuing reliance on fossil fuels, coupled with a stubborn refusal to develop alternative fuels, and this Standard Oil sign will soon be representative of the whole planet.
7615 2018-11-24 22:14:51 That one should make sense but d ones sold by Awka ppl are tragic,they make it with that chaff from palm oil
7616 2018-11-24 22:14:44 Just the other day Trump was thanking the Saudis for the low oil prices
7617 2018-11-24 22:14:39 We are in the bus and having a pit stop at Brandon Timmies. Only 45 Mins away from Oil Town...

7624 2018-11-24 22:14:07 It is not about oil prices we know this. It’s all about when macron said we are going to set up EU army here you go ! Trump got upset and he was looking reason the give EU lesson up rising will go on won’t be just France next please
7625 2018-11-24 22:14:05 We burn the midnight oil in order to beat our clients expectations
7626 2018-11-24 22:14:03 Buying a nice property and growing your own beautiful garden and then going to the grocery store and buying all your fresh vegetables is the same thing as Justin Trudeau buying oil from Saudi Arabia.
7627 2018-11-24 22:13:57 thanking Joe, the manager of the Cormier Avenue Fast Track Oil Change Centers for saving me a whole ton of money in car repairs by being vigilant and truthful and helpful when I go for in an oil change.
7628 2018-11-24 22:13:36 Do Brits use heating oil? It’s the same thing and impacts demand in winter
7629 2018-11-24 22:13:26 Boycott Saudi oil...hurt them where they live
7630 2018-11-24 22:13:21 Yes.  It would be even better if refinery capacity was 100% funded by the oil billionaires though.
7631 2018-11-24 22:13:18 including the share used for export industries. Also, all other coal. And Oil. And Gas. And Deforestation. 
We need to stop all of those in a few years from now. #notimetowaste
7632 2018-11-24 22:13:11 Not being one I dont know. I can only guess, but I doubt it has anything to do with helping Americans.
7633 2018-11-24 22:13:08 Murdoch makes money from oil and gas, he's not going to report on global warming.

Check out Genie Energy... Guess who's on the board.

7635 2018-11-24 22:12:55 they did surgery on a grape and put motor oil on pancakes nothing is real
7636 2018-11-24 22:12:52 Hi Christopher, Thank you for contacting Pro Oil Change! Some locations do! Which location would you like to visit?
7637 2018-11-24 22:12:46 The Saudis are dogs.  Always have been, always will be.  But they have great influence over the unhinged Jew hating Middle East. So, we tolerate them. Oh, they have oil too.
7638 2018-11-24 22:12:36 Can I get some advice? Looking at running the Mishimoto Oil Cooler that you run on your 350z on my 370z. I’ve heard some mixed reviews on forums but you don’t seem to have any issues. Thoughts? Any advice or input is appreciated :)
7639 2018-11-24 22:12:26 No be palm oil you use?
7640 2018-11-24 22:12:17 There’s no density on La Brea through Baldwin Hills between Slauson and Rodeo due to the oil fields and parks. So that route would’ve been more direct, but it wouldn’t have impacted nearly as many potential riders.
7641 2018-11-24 22:12:07 Let's vote to PROTECT #Mueller.
Vote to kill arms sale to #MBS slaughterer and #liar. Ask Trump to stop #lying about amount of deal, # of jobs. Saudis can't buy from Russia/China (parts don't fit). Oil prices-for-silence acquiescence deal. World knows #weak president #lies.
7642 2018-11-24 22:12:01 This has nothing to do with oil prices you idiot , it has to do with marketing a product that we produce .
7643 2018-11-24 22:11:59 I’ve gotten it before just make sure you oil your scalp weekly . And wash it bc I’ve had my hair colored plenty of times and got sew ins . It doesn’t break off.
7644 2018-11-24 22:11:56 Can  Not  Wait  ! Looking forward to seeing you in Lucas Oil Stadium again!
7645 2018-11-24 22:11:53 This is wonderful, bro. How do you think this problem could be solved? 

More time to develop scripts? Buying already written scripts? More screenwriters and patronizing new promising ones?

Directors prefer same person that had written a great script yesterday than fresh oil.
7646 2018-11-24 22:11:51 Apparently the secret to a "flawless skin" is:
1. Lots of baby oil (or vegetable oil. Whatever oil you can get really) 
2. Sunlight.
3. An iPhone.
4. Add filters to taste.
Guaranteed for that sizzling look.
7647 2018-11-24 22:11:51 Peak Oil.
7648 2018-11-24 22:11:41 Thank God for that. More than half Americans actually give a fuck about America. 
We understand American isnt great because of money & oil. It's the people. The day to day people, living, loving, eating, celebrating together that matter and make America great.
Thank you 61%
7649 2018-11-24 22:11:32 The motor oil on the pancakes got me
7650 2018-11-24 22:11:22 I dey tell you. Too much oil.
7651 2018-11-24 22:11:08 No SAUDI OIL, they’ve corrupted for Decades! Stop CO2 omissions or the Human Race won’t survive, only Reptiles and some Fish. Evolution will have to start over!
7652 2018-11-24 22:11:05 feel free to refute any of the following:

Harris sold homeowners out to Trump pick Steve Mnuchin

Booker sold americans out to Big Pharma

Bidens son sits on an oil company board of execs

Warren has gone to bat for Raytheon.
7653 2018-11-24 22:11:04 Lmao sure what are your qualifications? Lemme guess, you read lots of blogs funded by oil corporations and have never heard of peer reviewed science? Wow, sounds like a great opportunity to hear some corporate doublespeak!

7655 2018-11-24 22:10:48 I forgot to mention in my last tweet that the Taylor oil spill has been spewing oil at 1000's of gal. A day since 2004 ..WTF  F-ING GREED! 
7656 2018-11-24 22:10:45 You still get the palm oil from the deforestation
 Even with the 8 principles for the growers on RSPO
7657 2018-11-24 22:10:45 him soon come back fi suck off the cela oil from offa you toe dem

7659 2018-11-24 22:10:05 I love oil Mets
7660 2018-11-24 22:10:02 Might want to pull a Oil chart and show them the fact that oil is in a free fall and has past this last week support from a year ago and if it does not stop the ramifications will be dire. but hey gas will be cheep.
7661 2018-11-24 22:10:02 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
7662 2018-11-24 22:10:01 The current implosion of oil price and Canada’s E&P sector could be the signal of the capitulation phase then morphing into the fist step of a secular bull phase because enormous underinvestment in World E&P sector and population growth . LNG sector will be the major winner!
7663 2018-11-24 22:09:48 And therefore industry was not interested in building a pipeline to tidewater. Blame oil companies. Not Trudeau.
7664 2018-11-24 22:09:31 Despite Trump, Dems took the house.  

The Mueller investigation is untouched.

Oil is at $50 a barrel, when Russia's production cost is $67.

Putin lost.
7665 2018-11-24 22:09:23 Oil maniacs are desperate, but the source of their addiction must go away to let the rest of us survive long term.
7666 2018-11-24 22:09:18 Why would other provinces join? And even if they did how would it save them from economic collapse?  Especially BC which would benefit from charging huge tariffs on Alberta to get its oil to water assuming they wanted to allow that which they currently dont want to.
7667 2018-11-24 22:09:15 Because @travis_hollman Cool Whip is Oil... Processed in some Weird way to resemble Whipped Cream! LOL I'm with you on the Whipped cream but it Has to Spray out of a can that Says (Made From Real Cream)!!! Real your labels, Stay Healthy!
7668 2018-11-24 22:08:59 Anyone dumb enough to fall for Burn a $Billion Brad’s BS here isn’t too bright. Brad is just doing what he’s paid to do by his new oil company employer. The way the MSM falls at his feet begging for interviews from him is why he gets paid well.

7670 2018-11-24 22:08:42 Doesn't add up imo.  Western economies have dominated age of oil and have been able to finance all the techno goods and junk for debt they can issue at will. Technooptimists rarely if ever do full supply chain accounting so they distort the picture imo.
7671 2018-11-24 22:08:38 What’s that smell? Pachouli oil!
7672 2018-11-24 22:08:37 omg why did i ever stop using primer oil! my skin look airbrushed
7673 2018-11-24 22:08:27 In trgards to the oil pipeline development which would creste hunfreds of well paying jobs for canadians but globalist trudesu prefers to push the un climate fraud instead which makes him canadas biggest pm clusterfuck to date
7674 2018-11-24 22:08:26 I won't be doing them jobs that's for sure. I will sooner boil my head in engine oil than prop up farming or wipe shitty bums!
7675 2018-11-24 22:08:19 I have. Regarding your tweet subsidies create excess demand , oil or EV. Telsa currently is a regressive tax for the benefit of another play toy the 1% can enjoy..
7676 2018-11-24 22:08:02 Time for Scotland to cut loose from the failed UK and  demand the £4 Trillion Oil Revenue to be returned then we can pay the Treasury a few billion to help England when IT Leaves Europe
7677 2018-11-24 22:07:45 It does, and since then we’ve moved our entire investment philosophy to place sustainability at its core and divested oil and where possible focused on achieving zero fossil fuel exposure. We even won an award for our upgraded approach . So January was more good work by you!
7678 2018-11-24 22:07:45 Buying an Oil Diffuser was the best decision ive ever made!! They have timers and imo spread the scent out so much better and the oils last forever!
7679 2018-11-24 22:07:39 #youthvgov go to NPR headline, Saudi Arabia's Ambitious Overhaul Hinges on Reducing it's Oil Addiction (not) to read.
7680 2018-11-24 22:07:35 Thanks for this I thought I was he only one who thinks he is a mouth piece know it all that knows nothing about anything. Pretty face,  doesn't mean there is a genius under that mop of hair. He has master the snake oil salesman routine to perfection.

7682 2018-11-24 22:07:19 CRUDE OIL

It is utter shame, that every single financial media and financial institution promotes higher energy prices.

It is an absolute shame. Enemies of the people.

Financial Elite is the enemy of the people.
7683 2018-11-24 22:07:00 Mattiscombe beach, Devon, UK. 1.5m X 1.2m oil and acrylic on canvas. For sale soon ...
7684 2018-11-24 22:06:58 The power is out at my house so I guess I'll read the farmers almanac by an oil lamp like they did in the olden days.
7685 2018-11-24 22:06:54 I now check for palm oil in everything. Keep fighting the good fight!
7686 2018-11-24 22:06:51 use oil defusers or incense as an alternative:)
7687 2018-11-24 22:06:42 Nice bounces off the 200 day. I don't think anyone is bearish on oil in 2025. We're going to have shortages due to lack of investment in a few years.
7688 2018-11-24 22:06:33 Yes, it is. And 97% of the worlds leading scientists agree. Who's making money? Last I checked our entire economy is based on oil.
7689 2018-11-24 22:06:29 You already got it, he told the Saudis to pump more oil.  Voila! Instant tax cut.
7690 2018-11-24 22:06:23 Can't agree more with this. For some reason this c*cksuckers can't comprehend the concept of sovereignty. Especially when that country is swimming in oil.
7691 2018-11-24 22:06:16 Were the chips cooked in lard or vegetable oil? Are the eggs from the Chickens in the garden? hmmm? hmmm? Is the Butter real proper butter - if the answer is yes - can I call over for dinner?
7692 2018-11-24 22:06:12 #youthvgov  Alert, "gov" is buying additional pressure! International investors will buy never (ever!) sold before stock in Saudi oil company Aramaco to increase the number of influential people who have skin in this lawsuit.

7698 2018-11-24 22:05:24 Oil is far below where Russia can make a profit, and it's only going down from here.

Their entire economy is oil based.  The government will soon be insolvent.

Meanwhile Dems take the house in January, Trump's allies are all deserting him, and Mueller's closing in.
7699 2018-11-24 22:05:21 Nice try to cover the liberals ass but no cigar  lol, you see the liberals have wasted billions and plan to waste billions more as proven by this very logo while sosting vanada 8 billion a day in lost oil revenues do to trudeais incompetance and relunctance to get out of the way
7700 2018-11-24 22:05:14 use lukewarm/cold water when you wash your hair! you can make a mixture of 2-4 drops of tea tree oil to half a teaspoon of coconut oil&rub it into your scalp before showering, then shampoo as normal. I don’t recommend shampooing every day as it strips moisture from your scalp.
7701 2018-11-24 22:04:58 I don't think it would be long before mb ,sask and bc would join them,they can't get their oil to tidewater right now either. Once bc joined,a deal could be made quickly
7702 2018-11-24 22:04:54 Just when I was about to be settled in bus, another worse incident happened, it brokedown and oil spilled. We have to wait for another 2hous and now we have shifted to seater bus. We spend 1400rs per ticket to travels via seater..???
All passengers are getting trouble due to this
7703 2018-11-24 22:04:37 Not cruelty free if you use palm oil 
7704 2018-11-24 22:04:31 I know you're not supposed to, but I decant cold used oil into a bottle and reuse it. Also, best thing imo for scooping out of hot oil is Joseph Joseph scoop colander.
7705 2018-11-24 22:04:30 The President is worring about arms deal.Worring about oil prices, just hopes not his hotels.

7707 2018-11-24 22:04:21 @SamWebb77 I can’t wait to hear you defend the great D. Brown. The emperor with no clothes, the snake oil salesman of all time who will never beat a really good team. Embarrassing effort by Michigan
7708 2018-11-24 22:04:14 You’re citing examples where totalitarianism/fascism, mafia-like governments took hold. That’s not liberalism. Inclusiveness, openness, community mindedness, rejection of the military industrial complex and big oil. That’s the way forward. The whole reason for refugees is war.
7709 2018-11-24 22:03:49 Current price circa $60/barrel but oil companies make profit as low as $30 these days.
7710 2018-11-24 22:03:34 UK oil production peaked in 1999, and the UK became a net importer in 2005. There is a downward trend which will carry on with the odd blip. Production won't cease for a long time, but it will become trivial.
7711 2018-11-24 22:03:28 I supposed to washed my hair @ 3... tell me why it’s 5 and I’m just now letting my oil sit for a little bc I just washed it. remind u my first event starts at 8. I gotta get my make up done and all.
7712 2018-11-24 22:03:27 Chalk one more up for not trusting the oil craporations. They just take a crap on us and move on.

Think about it! Get this to corporate and have them message me for more details. #savesears

7716 2018-11-24 22:03:00 One more tip for my hardgainer bros:

Drink more calories. No, not Natty Light.

High quality olive oil like @SeloOils on errything from the guys @KyleTrouble @SeloSlav .

Heart healthy + bonus cals
7717 2018-11-24 22:02:47 Do we have to keep covering up for murderers to keep low oil prices?
7718 2018-11-24 22:02:34 It is ironic seeing a Pilot Oil commercial during the Vols debacle against Vandy. The Haslam's ruined UT football with their undue influence. If you are a UT fan, buy your gas somewhere else. #PoweredByTheT

7721 2018-11-24 22:02:05 Thought my account got locked from you guys spamming report so I didn't bother responding, but I guess not. Anyway, propaganda from snake oil salesmen like Sowell or Mises don't count as real economic textbooks, I'm already familiar with any discipline that has proof of success.
7722 2018-11-24 22:01:59 Keep them guessing with " Oil of Olay ". It`s call sarcasm people. I`m done with these " Fake " children that have invaded the school system. They are predators. Plain and simple.

7724 2018-11-24 22:01:45 Putin hates chess because he can't cheat.

He's no chess master, just a common thug.

With oil this low, the Russia government will soon be broke and Putin will either be hanging from a rafter or will have fled the country.
7725 2018-11-24 22:01:39 Yeah this a reach. Serena look like she ain’t give a pure complete fuck, she got cooking oil on her clothes. I’m not a fan of Cardi B, but she at least tried.
7726 2018-11-24 22:01:37 Friends of mine say they leave lights on at night for them (they lose vision as they age) and that helps. For what it's worth, I have recently tried CBD oil to help and it has lessened her confusion at night. If you are able to try it. Good luck, love, let us know how she does.

7728 2018-11-24 22:01:28 I don't buy the physical stuff all automated argument especially post oil order.  I think more likely we use automation to assist in an increasingly distributed and regional modes of production, based on simple fact it'll be the least energy intensive way to org.

7730 2018-11-24 22:01:00 That’s terrible. Here in Indiana it a two day event at Luca Oil Stadium. 3 games Friday and 3 game Saturday. They do a good job with getting schools fans in and out between games.
7731 2018-11-24 22:00:58 Sene başından beri bayağı bir girmiş görünüyor  
(BBC)
Diesel prices have surged 16% this year from an average 1.24 euros ($1.41) per liter to 1.48 euros ($1.69), even hitting 1.53 euros in October, according to UFIP, France's oil industry federation.
7732 2018-11-24 22:00:51 me too. In my experience most Americans are not educated to take climate change seriously. It was part of my school education. You are a teacher: what is the US curriculum on climate change/Environment? Do you cover emissions, plastic, climate, oil?
7733 2018-11-24 22:00:38 I need massage with warm olive oil 
7734 2018-11-24 22:00:32 Dae ken aboot promising, if we had nae oil the English government widnae be so determined tae keep Scotland in the 'Union'
7735 2018-11-24 22:00:22 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
7736 2018-11-24 22:00:13 We have enough oil that we can use solar roadways to get off of the Saudis.q
7737 2018-11-24 22:00:09 Caps are so convincing, aren’t they? Lol! Can you prove it’s not a scam considering every single proclamation of doom has not occurred? Don’t be fooled. Remember back in the 1970s when they said we would be out of oil by 2000? The lineups at gas stations? They want you afraid.
7738 2018-11-24 22:00:07 November 24, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

7740 2018-11-24 22:00:01 I feel bad for you guys over in the UK, you all got sold a bill of goods from snake oil salesmen riding the nationalist wave.

The capitalists simply want to use the EU exit as convenient leverage to gut the social safety net just like they did in America back in the 1990s.
7741 2018-11-24 21:59:51 Some times I wonder , is this wax or car oil
7742 2018-11-24 21:59:35 Market it were,it’s shitty oil from the tar sands,the only market is in the US and the yanks buy it at a deep discount,and it’s very expensive to get it in the liquid form or sludge form lol
7743 2018-11-24 21:59:06 @CiaoSamin working through your book and it’s great. Quick question, what is your stance on cooking with extra virgin olive oil
7744 2018-11-24 21:58:56 this is pizza for real soliders! I never tried one like that, although I once had one made of thin dough and arugula + olive oil and it was good tbh 
7745 2018-11-24 21:58:54 We don’t need Saudi Oil. We don’t need Saudi money. Maybe trump does,maybe jared does, but America doesn’t. We are a giant economy and they economy. They have a few billionaires. We are a massive machine of billionaires. We don’t need them. #JusticeForJamal #JamalKhashoggi #First

7758 2018-11-24 21:58:11 But now I do have to ask, what on earth is thieves oil? 
7759 2018-11-24 21:58:09 Build wind farms across the devastated Alberts oil sands
7760 2018-11-24 21:57:58 Alberta's economy is built around oil. It's a land locked province with no where to sell its oil except maybe the USA who wont give it better prices than it does today. Without the rest of canada to support it Alberta will face massive unemployment ala Venezuela
7761 2018-11-24 21:57:50 @WhiteHouse @vp@@foxandfriends @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @FLOTUS great Stock Market, Trumps. Great job for your US Oil  Co friends too. You’re really president of Saudi Arabia. By the way, what’ve the trumps done for California, Florida, Puerto Rico in recovery?
7762 2018-11-24 21:57:48 Putin's trying to save himself.

Oil is way down and Russia's losing money on each barrel, the state is going bankrupt, and his spy network is being disabled chunk by chunk.
7763 2018-11-24 21:57:40 i can and will. you and your waifu are like oil and water
7764 2018-11-24 21:57:36 Yes , All the Coking Coal, Thermal Coal ,  Iron Ore , Nickle, Aluminium , now Shale Oil,   BUT ,  we export them all for others to take advantage off !    Pity isn’t it !  Another reason to thank “ OUR” Elected Representatives for !   aka Agenda Driven UN Fuckwits !
7765 2018-11-24 21:57:03 Out of curiosity Mr Kenney, at what price is the oil flowing through these pipelines being sold?  Isn't that the issue? Isn't that why you're saying that's not good enough? Isn't that why you're demanding from Trudeau what you weren't competant enough to do in 10 years?
7766 2018-11-24 21:56:53 This part of the 'street theatre' tactic they use. Very organized on their part. Remember Greenpeace hanging off Calgary Tower? Oil workers are trained for PUBLIC SAFETY..NOT RISK.
7767 2018-11-24 21:56:41 Are you really insinuating that blowing off your intelligence agencies and openly admitting you value arms sales and cheap oil more than human rights is acceptable because obama didn't march in paris?
7768 2018-11-24 21:56:33 “Actually, 5th century Athens was at its heart an oil economy...” I would almost pay to hear a petro pusher say that

Now I understand.
7779 2018-11-24 21:55:30 Scrub it with a green scrubbie -no soap, dry it, pop on the stove top with bacon fat or or a high heat oil in it and let heat up up for a while. When it’s cool wipe it out. Never use soap in it and avoid cooking acidic things like tomato in it. (From a Yankee;)
7780 2018-11-24 21:55:20 I just found Dr Brouse's toothpaste recipe. I made it and added 7 drops of wintergreen oil,  Do you recognize the jar?
7781 2018-11-24 21:55:19 Don't trust the snake oil salesman
7782 2018-11-24 21:55:06 It really depends on your hair texture and how you hair holds in moisture. Some products to start with are coconut oil and shea butter if you want to be fully organic. I recommend trying different natural hair products till you find one that works specifically to your hair.
7783 2018-11-24 21:54:58 Even without oil Scotland has a wealth of resources.  We are a rich nation.  Independance is normal,  why is Scotland uniquely incapable of managing her affairs?
7784 2018-11-24 21:54:52 love that! in the late ‘50s, I thrilled to a rousing jingle (Imperial Oil/Esso) that accompanied the CBC tv broadcasts..
7785 2018-11-24 21:54:40 The literal, sleeping demon remained dormant to her actions, so long as her hand didn't hover near the olives for too long. Literally, anything else was fine. She could probably put in motor oil and he'd prefer it, over olives.
7786 2018-11-24 21:54:36 Oh, and the floor was so greasy almost couldn’t walk on it, like they actually mopped with fryer oil…
7787 2018-11-24 21:54:32 When will people finally realise that we have a severe climate crisis? We can not afford more oil and gas and stupid pipelines. The challenge of the 21st century is not about solutions but about awareness and adoption.
7788 2018-11-24 21:54:26 "Castor oil" c’est huile de ricin en anglais. L’huile de ricin c extrait à froid, huile karapat c l’huile de ricin extrait à chaud(Jamaïcan black castor oil).

7789 2018-11-24 21:54:24 Doug wants lower gas prices for the people of Ontario not sure how that’s going to help the folks in Alberta,OPEC sets the market and the Yanks under a real leader are fraking like a two pecker billy goat.The world is awash in oil
7790 2018-11-24 21:54:23 Even Obama has enough sense to make USA oil self sufficient. The bunch  in Montreal, Saudi Arabia , St John & Venezuela are exploiting Canada and destroying our prairie provinces with the PMO’s tactics.
7791 2018-11-24 21:54:21 Coconut oil!
7792 2018-11-24 21:54:18 We don't need no steenking science, what we need is more rakes. Oh and Saudi Oil money.

7794 2018-11-24 21:54:07 How many are you going to take into your house?  I wonder what a reaction you would have if even one of these people knocked on your door and asked to use your phone and your bathroom.  I’d love to have an oil painting  of that modern art scene.
7795 2018-11-24 21:54:05 If it’s a sweet potato from a respectable cold climate all you have to do is roast it. If you want, cut in half and drizzle with olive oil & salt or roast it under any drippy chicken/duck/fowl. It will make its own caramel pretty much. The less you do to it the better 
7796 2018-11-24 21:54:01 No worries.  That Rosneft pipeline with Russian oil will supply our needs just fine once we're done alienating our ally, Canada.

7798 2018-11-24 21:53:50 And unsustainable palm oil
7799 2018-11-24 21:53:45 it's nearly all candy companies.. and McVities, and Fox's, even our Scottish oatcakes are made with palm oil. Only 1-2 brands without. Disgusting.
7800 2018-11-24 21:53:20 Alberta isn’t interested in progressive ideas. It has never had to work to sell oil and now that the prices are falling to nothing, they just want handouts from that federal nanny-state they have long criticized.
7801 2018-11-24 21:53:09 Haha it’s quite alright I was expecting to be called out on it. We took creative liberties on the frunk. In that inside the trunk pov scene, @elonmusk put something in the frunk that will be important when Big Oil Strikes Back.
7802 2018-11-24 21:52:58 What do you know, that Exxon doesn't? 
BP? Citgo? All the large oil companies? They are voting against you with their money. Isn't that what you're always saying should happen? 
They are spending money in spite of _your_ "skepticism." 
So, tell me the secret. I'd make millions.
7803 2018-11-24 21:52:42 But how long will it be before we see that price reflected at the pumps? They are quick enough to put price of fuel up when oil price rises.
7804 2018-11-24 21:52:39 More oil than they know what to do with.

Probably more than $50 mill by now. Plenty of other sites to invest that money in. The deal makes perfect sense. Both sides get benefits both have a fair interest to move forward.
7805 2018-11-24 21:52:39 Doesn't that raise the price of oil?  Isn't that basically what SA is about?  Controlling the stock pile and therefore keeping the cost up
7806 2018-11-24 21:52:33 Boy, you guys really want their oil.  Just think, if some Russian made a video like this aimed at the US?  They'd call it an act of war.
7807 2018-11-24 21:52:27 My challenges this week: don’t use single use plastic, make a list of things that use palm oil and never buy them again, reduce my carbon footprint #ClimateChange
7808 2018-11-24 21:52:22 Norway is the size of Alberta- aprox 6mil!!
Alberta shares its oil revenue with 35+mil. Not a good comparison!!
But compared to the world stage, Canada has very healthy social programs. Our medical for one. 
However, not for long though- at the rate we are losing oil revenues
7809 2018-11-24 21:52:13 Losing jobs to automation is BS, jobs will just change. We already have less pollution and some of the cleanest water and air ever. Most of our resources are not finite. I've been hearing this "peak oil" BS since I was a kid.

7817 2018-11-24 21:51:11 Falling oil prices is very bad for oil selling countries - it is deflation. Keynes said, deflation is a transfer of wealth from the poor (or producers) to the rich (or receivers).
7818 2018-11-24 21:51:10 Even Bush was a globalist. He firmly believed that all nations should be unified and looking out for each other in order to keep the wheels in motion. The downsides were his motives. Having your hands in other pies for oil. Trump’s doing that and abandoning all globalism.
7819 2018-11-24 21:50:59 Lolololololololololololololololololololoololololololololol At least we know what Lucas Oil looks like. Hahahahahahahahahhahahaahhahahahahahahahahahhahahaha
7820 2018-11-24 21:50:50 Reducing it down to resources ignores the threat of dictators & Radical Islam. Some of those countries we combat, some we don’t. We aren’t in Sudan-if we wanted their oil, why aren’t we? If we wanted Iraq’s oil, why’d we leave until going there to fight ISIS? Oversimplifying it.

7827 2018-11-24 21:50:28 we just spent $118 on olive oil i love being italian
7828 2018-11-24 21:50:26 5 tblsp of tomato puree, quarter tea spoon of salt, half a teaspoon of redhilli powder, juice from half a lemon, one tsp of oil.

 Add the oil in a small saucepan and one tblsp of the  puree. Add the salt, red chilli powder and lemon juice and combine. Add rest of the puree +
7829 2018-11-24 21:50:23 Excuse me--oil is about $50 a barrel which is $20 less than a few months ago--what the hell is going on in France? I guess they are collaborating with the oil companies like they collaborated with the Germans in WWII. (for you snowflakes, that World Ware 2 not 11)

7836 2018-11-24 21:48:52 @IrinaSlav1 .. building pipelines wont solve oil issue in Canada as you need buyers to buy it good vol at good price..no sure if there is one. I feel govt should build refinery capable of handling WCS and buy oil from producers at market price.

7844 2018-11-24 21:48:02 Sometimes the truth hurts.
Trying to push the pipeline through will likely only slow down the process.
Maybe if and when the pipeline is ever built, Alberta should do as Norway does and institute a special tax. 
Once the oil is all gone or we have an alternative then what for AB?
7845 2018-11-24 21:48:01 Alberta taxpayers have long enjoyed low taxes and full package govt services.  Without oil royalties the whole thing is unsustainable.  We need to cut services and bring in a sales tax.  But that’s political suicide here...

7863 2018-11-24 21:45:53 Dr,, your comments are misguiding folks in Haiti. Price of oil in US is lower than world price because US has transportation issues.Too much OIl inventory. Oil is not gasoline! Price of gasoline is still high! OPEC meets Dec 6. Oil WW might head up. Stop reading tea  leaves!

7865 2018-11-24 21:45:43 Wouldn't it have been great if Hillary Clinton hadn't gone around the world promoting Fracking, and Obama hadn't opened as much oil drilling as he could (not to mention doing nothing with DAPL)?

Trump is just the tail end of the problem.
7866 2018-11-24 21:45:40 Oil prices are dipping. Nigeria is in BIG BIG trouble.
7867 2018-11-24 21:45:35 Of course,  they get more money from the insurance lobbyists,  banking lobbyists and oil lobbyists than they do from gun lobbyists. As a result, healthcare has become unaffordable, economic recessions and gas prices breaking the bank.
7868 2018-11-24 21:45:35 CBD oil and sauna.. name a better combo
7869 2018-11-24 21:45:17 Just imagine the contracts you could hand out and the kick backs you could get #Trump . It's a ten year project and Big Oil wouldn't be hurt by it for about five. If they wanted to invest they could make money as well and diversify their companies as we ween ourselves off of oil.
7870 2018-11-24 21:45:13 Brutal dictatorship oil. Conservative values. That you are in this subject area at all, just that. #yegcc #ableg
7871 2018-11-24 21:45:13 Who told Nsukka people that they use to put ukpaka and red oil inside shawarma? 
7872 2018-11-24 21:45:12 May God appoint you & your family... beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that you all might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified. 
7873 2018-11-24 21:45:04 Alaskans own 520,692 shares of BONAVISTA ENERGY CORP, worth $1,350,875. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.
7874 2018-11-24 21:45:04 Why not just prescribe CDB oil? It would calm the mind and allowing focus.
7875 2018-11-24 21:45:01 yes. and a good way to accelerate the change is by not fetishizing existing institutions, such as oil companies. an oil company could be evaporated with the stroke of a pen. all our problems will be solved as soon as enough people realize how ephemeral oil companies are.
7876 2018-11-24 21:44:53 Ay3 ka!!!... 3,930
The way Bitcoin prices are going, we'll start drilling it like petroleum oil soon...
7877 2018-11-24 21:44:37 Don’t forget , taxing the oil industry  as well ! The fact that we are over 7 billion on this planet  and produce so much garbage has no affect on climate ?? Right ! You can’t extract money from garbage so oil is the chosen villain !!
7878 2018-11-24 21:44:31 Last digit of your age...

7879 2018-11-24 21:44:00 I didn't know there was a tax on oil. Atleast not from buyer side.
7880 2018-11-24 21:43:45 I stay in a oil field city so y’all shit cheap lol

7883 2018-11-24 21:43:35 @tomgrantpi Many people get sent away 4 life with far less evidence. Why is she still free? In England they pull prints that have been wiped down or off. The oil in our skin permanently keeps your fingerprints in tact. Use that tech and lock her up once and for all of us.
7884 2018-11-24 21:43:29 Hmmmmmm...we don't have those products here. I've been using Palmer's Shea butter shampoo and their coconut oil conditioner. 
Awesome!! Come out smelling like a chocolate cake. Whhaaaa....
7885 2018-11-24 21:43:25 Well that's encouraging, far less oil rig burn off in our hemisphere.  Oh, that's right.  We just let it vent....
7886 2018-11-24 21:43:04 My good friend Rob. Let’s try and extrapolate; 

Foreign investment = GDP, job growth, strengthening of the CDN economy.

Foreign interference = transfer of oil production to another region (US & OPEC nations). No gain for environment. loss of wealth/GDP for Canada.
7887 2018-11-24 21:43:00 Yah girl just found a 1900 catholic oil lamp converted to a real lamp with all the jewels intact and original gold yesss the aesthetic

7890 2018-11-24 21:42:55 The Uncle Tams will not be disconcerted that Scots now know truth about the extent of our oil resources. They will create other scare stories  to reinforce English hegemony.
7891 2018-11-24 21:42:48 MOTOR OIL?
7892 2018-11-24 21:42:31 Researching renewable energies is exhausting because we consume so much more than we can produce... Our massive energy consumption depends on stocks of ancient photosynthesis from coal, oil, gas... its a fundamentally imbalanced equation

7898 2018-11-24 21:41:35 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
7899 2018-11-24 21:41:35 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7900 2018-11-24 21:41:30 Sounds like a plot of big oil or the #KochBrothers to seal the demise of #SolarEnergy!
7901 2018-11-24 21:41:25 No it's so easy and we eat it with bread ! You just cook chopped onions and bell peppers with olive oil in a pan, add tomato sauce and finish with pepper and salt. I ate that today and it's really good
7902 2018-11-24 21:40:56 Exactly. Price in the costs (environmental, health) due to *not capturing* the waste produced in burning fossil fuels, and all of a sudden, coal, oil & gas aren’t so cheap anymore.

But never again , atiku ll take over come 2019
7907 2018-11-24 21:40:19 Sending troops overseas to protect America’s “interests” (oil) to fight a war that so many ppl were against, the least you can do for the vets when they come home is share the immense profits the gov’t is making from them. They’re risking their lives, it’s the least you could do.

7911 2018-11-24 21:40:00 I saw the picture out of context and assumed it was some sort of fish oil tablet with a novelty fish print on it. Who the fuck would fall for this?
.... wait never mind, people would.
7912 2018-11-24 21:39:51 it's just one time!! and i used heat protection plus an oil afterwards pleaaase
7913 2018-11-24 21:39:36 One important thing people don’t THINK about ! What would happen if all the Muslims oil they have would dry up .What would they be worth ? We have other resources !That the U.S.A. doesn’t need them as much as they need us.Dictators kill for POWER ! China,Russia bad choice !
7914 2018-11-24 21:39:36 How long can this oil change light blink?
7915 2018-11-24 21:39:18 We need the John F. Kennedy "man on the moon at the end of this decade" bold action. Al Gore had it right twenty years ago. Unfortunately, the destructive forces of oil and greed lied, cheated, and bullied their way into power.
7916 2018-11-24 21:39:02 Or the current rate of climate change is unprecedented, caused by our addition of CO2 to atmosphere, and you're the victim of a calculated misinformation campaign by the oil industry that has 10s of trillions of dollars to lose if we move to renewable energy.
7917 2018-11-24 21:38:53 Let’s not forget the national security benefits of getting off of oil.  Without oil money, Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc. lose a great deal of influence.
7918 2018-11-24 21:38:50 Waste of oil if they really make thier commercials that way.
7919 2018-11-24 21:38:50 Maybe no one has told the 10 yr about the oil price so if we just keep it quiet

7922 2018-11-24 21:38:39 Baby oil. So while you're still wet from the shower or bath...put it on top of the water. In extreme cases, wet the skin & apply oil. You can do this maybe 4 times a day. They'll disappear in about a month. Also drink water
7923 2018-11-24 21:38:28 I didn’t know Walmart do oil changes & shit
7924 2018-11-24 21:38:19 Over intelligence is doing you...You get oil for head

7926 2018-11-24 21:38:14 Yeah. Remember the BP oil spill in the Gulf? Or Three Mile Island? Or the Exxon Valdez? Or...etc.
7927 2018-11-24 21:38:09 Did trump condemn Germany about being dependent on Russian oil? So what does that say about his stance on Saudi Arabia. Hmm @angela_rye @SenKamalaHarris @KamalaHarris

7934 2018-11-24 21:37:10 There is absolutely no evidence that oil and gas prices would go up if the US sanctioned Saudi Arabia for their horrible premeditated murder of a US journalist.  We deserve to know all of @realDonaldTrump dealings and money flows.

7944 2018-11-24 21:36:12 I hope that the tap dancing snake oil salesman coaches the game of his life and beats the cheese turds. Sadly, as a Minnesota sports fan, I feel no conflict in this
7945 2018-11-24 21:36:11 No they fucking don't. You need a fuel source(electricity/gas/oil) to run a compressor, that then creates energy which you store (in this example the stored energy is compressed air) which when released powers the turbine. The turbine doesn't create it's own compressed air.
7946 2018-11-24 21:36:01 Yes it’s obviously those money-grubbing scientists who have a nefarious agenda to make global warming “a thing”. And oil companies have nothing to gain by casting doubt on the scientific consensus on global warming. 
7947 2018-11-24 21:35:56 "What the federal government should have done is accept the assistance of foreign countries ...The Dutch and the Norwegians, they are known for dikes and for cleaning up water and for dealing with spills." --Sarah Palin, on solving the Gulf oil spill crisis, Fox News, 2010-06-15
7948 2018-11-24 21:35:51 Putin can only pull off his ludicrous legerdemain on the Russian people for so long. His economy is (literally) running out of gas. And Exxon can’t get that Arctic Sea oil for you, Vladimir. So sad! Tick tock, motherfucker.
7949 2018-11-24 21:35:48 I go to buy oil 

“who’s changing your oil? Your bf????”

“You need me to carry this to you car?” 

“Shouldn’t your bf be here helping you??” 

Let me do me in peace lol

7969 2018-11-24 21:32:54 Would have been nice to have a perhaps brief run down of the issues making this so complex; FN rights, glut on the market, historical happiness of AB to be reliant on US buyers, shale revolution, Trump's politics aligning with MBS and Putin as top 3 oil controllers - etc.
7970 2018-11-24 21:32:45 흠
7971 2018-11-24 21:32:45 I need Sodium
7972 2018-11-24 21:32:15 I've had minimal contact with people today and spent the entire day in my kitchen just cooking, eating, cleaning, and repeat. I've just eaten my second dinner. There's hair oil all over my scalp. Why do I go out on the sesh when I can literally do this every damn evening?!
7973 2018-11-24 21:32:11 Cooked with oil instead of fry light for first time in ages and it changed my life

7975 2018-11-24 21:31:53 I usually do a roast veg medley if I'm feeding a crowd a couple of garlic cloves and a wedged onion makes chunks of potatoes and carrots coated in oil, any oil, seem fancy af
7976 2018-11-24 21:31:52 I think I'm gonna eat that motor oil cuz...
7977 2018-11-24 21:31:47 Are you trying to put the oil workers out of business just as it was getting better by sucking up to Saudi?
7978 2018-11-24 21:31:47 I did not say electric car. I'm also not saying oil does not create benefits. What I'm saying is that oil creates damages that we ignore at our peril. That something feels good does not always make it a good idea.
7979 2018-11-24 21:31:34 I can't wait to go vegan and stop eating fried foods. I'll still be vegan keto but a lot of my stuff will be boiled, steamed, and raw now and uncooked oil will be used. That's my plan anyways.
7980 2018-11-24 21:31:33 Please send me $50 to order some Leo Oil.
7981 2018-11-24 21:31:30 That is strictly for scent. A couple drops of any essential oil you like
7982 2018-11-24 21:31:26 Is that why we provide billions in annual subsidies to the oil and gas sector? 
7983 2018-11-24 21:31:26 Not buying US overpriced oil or natural gas is being hostile to US according to Trump and it appears also to you even if you are not Iranian but a "foe", enemy like EU but not as bad as China or worst Iran but close. Russia, China, EU are "foes" now to US.

7986 2018-11-24 21:31:17 Not even for loot - the US and it's allies didn't get ANY OIL out of the war. Most of the Iraqi oil and petrochemical industry exports go to China, and then Europe. The war was caused by neo-con jews...and even THEY failed in their ultimate objectives in Iraq.

7993 2018-11-24 21:30:28 2018 BIG TEN EAST CHAMPIONS!! All Roads now to Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis next Saturday against Northwestern! Onward to Victory! #GoBuckeyes O-H!
7994 2018-11-24 21:30:26 @altonbrown Followed your cast iron ribeye instructions but with sirloin. Used canola oil (on the steak and to previously cure the pan) and the steak was slightly colder than room temperature. Could that have been what caused my house to fill with smoke? 
7995 2018-11-24 21:30:23 1 cup vinegar per gallon of water, but i can't find anything about lemongrass oil, did you add that for smell?
7996 2018-11-24 21:30:20 It's not just domestic waste.. the reversing of oil drilling safety standards, because of money, is another oil disaster waiting to happen, fraking is environmentally damaging. It's not just plastic floating in the oceans. It's a combination of all sorts human behavior.
7997 2018-11-24 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
7998 2018-11-24 21:30:11 Oh it`s yum easy, will check with Mum,  but basically just  flour and water from kettle or from cooking veg  /   mix   /   Marmite to taste (quite a lot).   Can`t remember if put a bit of marg in it at beginning - think I put bit of olive oil.
7999 2018-11-24 21:30:10 Tame your headaches by rubbing peppermint oil like tiger balm to the temples.
8000 2018-11-24 21:29:57 i have them & really like them! they made my nipples more sensitive & they make me happy. they do take a little bit of daily care to not be stinky lol (when will fic include someone cleaning their barbells & rubbing tea tree oil on their nipples annsns)
8001 2018-11-24 21:29:19 排泄物を口にしないで欲しい
8002 2018-11-24 21:29:08 Because it’s not about the oil.
8003 2018-11-24 21:29:04 I shopped small and found me some good oil by Nina Wells for my beard and skin. #shoplocal — attending ÀSE's 2nd Annual Shop Small Self Exhilaration Tour
8004 2018-11-24 21:29:04 "short oil"
8005 2018-11-24 21:28:57 But I know what the inside of Lucas Oil stadium looks like soooo...... 
8006 2018-11-24 21:28:57 The motor oil on the pancake  killed me
8007 2018-11-24 21:28:54 Every time UK Gov tries to perpetuate the myth that Scotland can't afford indy, we should charge them an extra £1 for every barrel of oil, every cubic meter of gas, every KW of electricity, every lb of salmon and every KG of beef we send over that border? #DissolveTheUnion
8008 2018-11-24 21:28:50 you know you're getting boring when your Christmas wish list includes an olive oil sprayer and a mattress topper
8009 2018-11-24 21:28:49 Because trump can’t envision a future where we don’t need oil. And I’m pretty sure Bush could have bought every person in the US a Prius for the same cost as the gulf war.

8013 2018-11-24 21:28:27 For the Planet to survive all governments must end all unnecessary plastic, especially single use, stop all palm oil production, ban trophy hunting, stop deforestation, show the inside of slaughter houses at schools and stop putting money first. Go plant based food #TakeYourSeat
8014 2018-11-24 21:28:24 BAGHDAD - Iraq will unify customs procedures in all of its border areas, including within semi-autonomous Kurdistan, the prime minister said on Wednesday, signaling a further thaw in ties between Baghdad and Erbil after a resumption of Kirkuk oil flows.
8015 2018-11-24 21:28:20 Hey @EnergyTransfer how is oil the safest resource we use when we have oil being dumped into our oceans at an alarming rate. But you are right about it being cheap. That’s really all you care about.
8016 2018-11-24 21:28:18 浣腸と脱糞はいいけどスカトロは………………………
8017 2018-11-24 21:28:10 Yep, pretty much this.

Similar logic could apply to cancer treatments (desperation and hope). Tons of snake oil out there.

Predictim sounds to me like snake oil.
8018 2018-11-24 21:28:08 Guys I finally got my oil changed. Bout time frfr.
8019 2018-11-24 21:27:59 食パンさんおは未来ちゃ！
8020 2018-11-24 21:27:58 Im in autozone and i just got a war flashback to when i hung out downtown with broski ans when we were leaving we saw someone doing an oil change into a water bottle
8021 2018-11-24 21:27:55 A lot of the "advances" of the 20th century planted the seeds of our destruction.  We invented plastic, billions of vehicles powered by fossil fuel hit the roads & skies, we processed foods & tossed the nutrients. We chemically altered oil & our bodies couldn't process it.
8022 2018-11-24 21:27:51 We all know I can’t shake my flat “I” or the rest of my accent. (Try saying oil to my friends the way we do in Harlan.) I always embrace it, because the truth is, no matter how “perfect” you try to be, someone’s not gonna like you.
8023 2018-11-24 21:27:48 My mom was makin Sautéed Spinach and she must have put too much oil in the pan or somethin bc there a BIG ASS FIRE I’m talkin HIBACHI STYLE BIG so long story short I’m never using the stove top again
8024 2018-11-24 21:27:43 I won’t ever get my oil changed at Walmart again , they too slow !
8025 2018-11-24 21:27:39 もつというと浣腸と脱糞とスカトロは全部別物だから
8026 2018-11-24 21:27:25 A friend has asked me to take her to a cannabis store next week, She wants to learn about the oils. I am glad to educate her so she can be more informed for future shopping on her own. Thoughts are changing. 6 months ago she would not even consider CBD oil.
8027 2018-11-24 21:27:16 Fantastic. Meanwhile, back at Chelsea, an effigy of David Luiz gets drawn, quartered, & boiled in oil

8029 2018-11-24 21:26:53 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
8030 2018-11-24 21:26:45 @JohnCornyn What are you going to do about Trump choosing Saudi's over American oil workers.  A bunch of us burned our #MAGA hats when we went on days off. He's going to get crushed in TX in 2020.  If you don't do anything about it you will lose too. It's sickening.
8031 2018-11-24 21:26:42 I'm not sure but I'm guessing probably fractionated coconut oil 
8032 2018-11-24 21:26:20 Keep in mind the current regime wants to drill in the US. Maybe they want to incite us to be so mad at Saudi Arabia that we refuse to buy their oil so they can justify drilling in Montana and near our national preserve land. Hmmmm.
8033 2018-11-24 21:26:16 Why do you post this protest story and don’t have anything about the protests in Calgary the other day about Cdn oil prices?  You have zero credibility as an unbiased news source.
8034 2018-11-24 21:26:14 So what are your views on an iScot which asserts income from oil as one of its arguments?

8040 2018-11-24 21:25:51 Then things got worse in the 60s as Vietnam changed the landscape for the Dems and reps. Rs became prowar, Dems antiwar. Then the oil crash of the 70s that led to reaganomics that massively consolidated wealth at the top despite recessions.
8041 2018-11-24 21:25:47 That pancake one destroyed me. Motor Oil? LOL
8042 2018-11-24 21:25:43 The Korean skincare and beauty section at CVS is very limited. There was hardly any Peripera products except for some eyebrow pencils, mascaras, a contour and highlighter cushion, oil compact powder, lip tints and balms. Worst of all, the lip balm I bought was used. And I think a
8043 2018-11-24 21:25:24 Why not environmentalists protesting against Bitcoin & Block Chains? miners are burning SO much of energy that is nothing but global warming. 

When it comes to people who are surviving on  jobs, environmentalists protest & close oil, gas and coal projects. Why not Block Chains?
8044 2018-11-24 21:25:19 I'm not quite sure whether coconut oil really does make miracles happen but so far I quite enjoy smelling like coconuts
8045 2018-11-24 21:25:04 Amazing...like California, fuel prices exorbitant; fuel taxes rising yet cost of oil plummeting down.
8046 2018-11-24 21:25:04 great way to start a shift is by getting boiling hot oil spilled on your ankles
8047 2018-11-24 21:24:33 It's just word play. The courts don't make the laws, only enforce them. Govt makes laws. Trudeau's govt changed the regulatory rules to bog down the approval process. Why does C48 only place a ban on Alberta oil & Canadian tankers? That's all sock boy.
8048 2018-11-24 21:24:26 When world oil prices goes down, french fries went up!
8049 2018-11-24 21:24:21 I now own an essential oil diffuser and i hate to be That Guy but... I love this thing so much... My house smells like a day spa..

Mama always told me it would be alright. I thought I needed the rush, but there was never enough
'Cause all I needed was some coconut oil. #lizzo

8059 2018-11-24 21:23:52 @MalickViews Just watched your November 24 episode of Breaking Views on the subject of Energy, Oil and Gas and the Mafia looting our own billions, and honestly, shivers and tremors were sent down my spine all through it. @ImranKhanPTI @AmirMateen2 @KlasraRauf @Asad_Umar Wake up!
8060 2018-11-24 21:23:51 @FlorentFlamion "motor oil" normal
8061 2018-11-24 21:23:51 Alberta should look at diversification.  It is a shame that the province wasted their “rainy day” fund.  Following years of extremely high oil prices, the province should have been ready to ride this low oil period.
8062 2018-11-24 21:23:48 It really is! Especially as I roasted the veggies (turnip, celery, onion, carrot) with fresh rosemary and a dash of olive oil. :-)

8067 2018-11-24 21:23:14 Another huge oil price rollback (7th straight week):
⇣ Diesel, P2.30/liter;
⇣ Gasoline, P1.10/liter; and
⇣ Kerosene, P2.10/liter.
8068 2018-11-24 21:23:03 Got a tub of roses last year ..binned 99% absolutely disgusting full of palm oil and cocoa butter.. milk content non existent. As for the others i wouldn't waste my cash
8069 2018-11-24 21:23:02 Back when peak oil really meant 'peak'--stocks would start declining faster than wells could be drilled, etc., with the real possibility of oil shortages by 2050--that may have been catastrophic, but at least it'd have been survivable.
8070 2018-11-24 21:22:47 I am NOT well-informed on oil.

That said, I believe there are significant differences in type/quality, from different regions. Refineries are geared to specific grades, & can not be easily changed. Oil is not fungible.

Plus, lower price will make some US oil unprofitable?

8074 2018-11-24 21:22:19 I'm so disappointed I missed your in-depth discussion on Whale Oil lol

Glad you had a great stream but please try streaming at normal times so I can actually catch one for once 
8075 2018-11-24 21:22:09 We might be at 'peak' oil production in terms of the energy return on investment, but stocks of shale & non-conventional oil are sufficiently large that even at current growth rates, a warming earth would kill us long before we run out of oil.
8076 2018-11-24 21:22:04 There is ONE refinery in the Maritimes. Just ONE. Owned by Irving.

In a world where the population constantly grows, how is it that a market that USED to be served by 3, and is now larger, is only served by 1?

The oil companies sold us a lie, and we believed it.

8082 2018-11-24 21:21:02 No they wouldn't. 

These solar farms don't work even built with Chinese slave labor and cheap steel.

Don't give me the war excuse. I don't make foreign policy. We got no oil from Iraq, the fucking Chinese got it.

We could've been pumping here except for environmentalists.

8100 2018-11-24 21:19:40 No replacement Anas. Oil makes the worked go round.
8101 2018-11-24 21:19:14 you posted performance of oil and stock market in same time period I posted your favorite ‘investment’sorry yours has much worse performance
8102 2018-11-24 21:19:11 lol I thought it had something to do with the dollar used to buy oil in the world.  It would be interesting to remove all the pension costs from those numbers and see what each state is then.
8103 2018-11-24 21:19:09 Ah Trump DID NOT cut gas prices and is quite incoherent when it comes to economics. He quite erroneously thinks Saudi Arabia lowered oil prices after letting it off the hook for Khashoggi murder! Oil is a global commodity. I am ot sure you or Trump know waht that is!
8104 2018-11-24 21:19:07 I know of oil execs., and on down the chain driving electric vehicles, no disputing they are the future, just doesn't happen overnight.

- is a hungry boy

He’s not your man. He’s Reynolds Woodcock.

They are able to obtain most of their energy needs from hemp fuel without the harm caused by oil and coal.

Environmental benefits of hemp McGill.

8115 2018-11-24 21:17:49 That article was written by an employee of the Heartland Institute. He claims to be a scientist but he’s a lawyer. Charles Koch, a big oil guy, is a key financier. They are climate change deniers and benefit from doing so.
8116 2018-11-24 21:17:44 The drop in oil is deflationary... And generally precedes a crisis
8117 2018-11-24 21:17:42 4. First President to preside over a cut to the credit-rating of the United States.
5. First President to violate the War Powers Act.
6. First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.

8119 2018-11-24 21:17:31 There are several palm oil apps that provide info on sustainable/orangutan safe palm oil (I’ve only tried one)
8120 2018-11-24 21:17:21 And likewise I think the exponential increase in efficiency of renewable alternatives combined with Peak Oil mean we're very close to the downslope regardless of what the capitalists do -- I'm just afraid it won't be fast *enough*, in which case I definitely want a fallback.
8121 2018-11-24 21:16:37 We need jobs, fuel, mazoe, cooking oil etc

8125 2018-11-24 21:16:09 never going to happen whilst our politicians are in the pockets of the coal, oil and gas industries
8126 2018-11-24 21:16:07 You haven't thought through this, really - If we never fought our multitrillion dollar wars to secure our oil so that you could burn it *economically* in your muscle cars - solar and wind would have long been economically viable.
8127 2018-11-24 21:16:07 Yes because canceling approved pipelines, buying an old pipeline, bill C-69, and creating the carbon tax was all done by oil corporations. NOT. It was the liberal/NDP government. This is why in one weekend 8,000 people were laid off. And now 2,000,000 jobs are in danger.
8128 2018-11-24 21:16:04 It’s not oil he is protecting. I believe it’s his own family. The name Kushner comes to mind!
8129 2018-11-24 21:15:58 Yeah, but at his age she probably does all the work.
8130 2018-11-24 21:15:51 One of my brothers runs a huge oil field, the other programs computers... I write dirty stories. 

My invitation to the family reunion must have gotten lost in the mail.
8131 2018-11-24 21:15:50 This is vote buying.
8132 2018-11-24 21:15:45 I just got Onnit Protein Bites - Chocolate Coconut Cashew (Box of 24), Total Human (30 day supply), Onnit Glutamine - Unflavored (60 serving tub), Shroom TECH Sport (28ct), Onnit 6 - Kettlebell, Melatonin Spray - Mint (1 fl. oz.), Onnit MCT Oil Toothpaste - Cacao Mint (6.6oz)
8133 2018-11-24 21:15:42 I wish I could find the Photoshop of pumpkin spice motor oil someone made a few years ago...
8134 2018-11-24 21:15:41 #IfIWereAFoodOrDrink I'd be a mediocre stick of butter served with olive oil...
8135 2018-11-24 21:15:37 Barilla refuses to use palm oil in their new chocolate spread that will compete with Nutella which does use palm oil. Barilla does not buy Canadian durum wheat because it is dessicated with glyphosate. @grheard @FinancialReview
8136 2018-11-24 21:15:08 i like the way baby oil smells.  Coconut oil is so overrated 
8137 2018-11-24 21:15:07 These two are are discussing one gosling they caught vaping hash oil and another gosling that won’t sleep at night because they can’t stop playing Fortnite. #love
8138 2018-11-24 21:14:59 olive oil dewicious...
8139 2018-11-24 21:14:43 Is that your wish?  You'll be disappointed.  America is one of the world largest oil producer .
8140 2018-11-24 21:14:36 Order of Shaving

- Wash
- Exfoliate
- Shave
- Exfoliate
- Lotion
- Gel or Oil  ( optional )
8141 2018-11-24 21:14:29 Four simple words. Propaganda provided courtesy of your home grown terrorist #NRA network. Enjoy the moment. The clock is ticking. The smell of gun oil is fading. You are dissolving into shameful history. Bye bye 
8142 2018-11-24 21:14:20 Government is funny. If they found diamonds or oil in your backyard it will be theirs, but if they found drugs it will be yours.
8143 2018-11-24 21:14:16 ....apparently oil is more important than Jamal Khashoggi..... @NPR @nprpolitics @CNN @cnni @FoxNews @TODAYshow
8144 2018-11-24 21:14:05 John has added more oil to this fire of childish school boys game of rivalry that will end up burning themselves and other innocent people around them. We really don’t need people like you all hash war fighters in this crypto space. We need people to work together for the good.
8145 2018-11-24 21:14:03 The way things going with oil pointing to peaking and rolling over in global demand, I'd venture January won't happen...but you never know with Powell. He's proven he doesn't like staying on script.

8147 2018-11-24 21:13:48 Do you think Donald Trump has ever had sex with Melania Trump?
8148 2018-11-24 21:13:47 That probably meant that he was getting better.

"Of course, sitting, or lying?"

She gave him option based on how his stomach was feeling, she also grabbed some oil.
8149 2018-11-24 21:13:33 Well so much for Rouhani being a moderate. When is the U. S. is going to understand that the Arab states are not our friends bc we buy their oil? We need to be energy independent and let trump and company live there.
8150 2018-11-24 21:13:28 yes - these oil country guys talking mkts is pretty funny.
8151 2018-11-24 21:13:27 Really stupid question, how does the flour stick, just with the oil?
8152 2018-11-24 21:13:10 Bio fuel. Uses palm oil
8153 2018-11-24 21:13:09 Moussa Sissoko Rosneft's Sechin flies to Venezuela, rebukes Maduro over oil shipments
8154 2018-11-24 21:13:09 both are bad . olived oil
8155 2018-11-24 21:13:08 They knew that harvesting oil from the oil sands would destroy the environment, but they simply didn’t care. Alberta is such a beautiful place, this truly is a tragedy.
8156 2018-11-24 21:12:57 ｻﾞｸｻﾞｸｯいくぞ！
8157 2018-11-24 21:12:55 Oil prices plummeting again
8158 2018-11-24 21:12:49 big mood
8159 2018-11-24 21:12:47 We know that Trump decided to Aleppo Saudi Arabia until the last sip of oil met Khashoggi and cut the road fell into the pit of American democracy after he decided to bury America in the solution of concealment and lying
8160 2018-11-24 21:12:47 Chris kenny is a dipstick all lubed up with dirty oil.  A true gauge of the crap of the extreme
8161 2018-11-24 21:12:43 You know that Saddam was heading to Kuwait to take that countries oil and enslave them? Not only that but took newborn babes from incubators and had them placed on the floor and made nurses watch as they died? I wish someone like Saddam on your house.
8162 2018-11-24 21:12:42 Politeness and kindness are the oil of society
8163 2018-11-24 21:12:37 $100 for an oil change $90 for a full tank may as well be $50000 just to breathe
8164 2018-11-24 21:12:36 Pick One of Each

- One Gel or Oil from last slide
- One Lotion from last slide
- Pick a razor to shave with
- Use a body wash 
- Exfoliate somehow
8165 2018-11-24 21:12:32 Egg + oil = helkauron 
8166 2018-11-24 21:12:17 I love Becho but the poll is calling me to click it ;-;
8167 2018-11-24 21:12:08 what shocks me is the shit they use to cover up the imperfections, like motor oil really is it THAT necessary???? 
8168 2018-11-24 21:12:05 Liabilities in my view.  No so so fat and oil dry there.
8169 2018-11-24 21:12:04 The next set of Nigerian billionaires will not sell only Cement, Spaghetti or own oil blocks. They will sell programmable technology that is customizable. Brace yourselves.
8170 2018-11-24 21:12:02 Because controlling Syrian oil fields and sanctioning any entity which sends oil to Syria isn't neocon behavior. I think the Syrian people freezing to death beg to differ. Trump may be neocon-lite but its little difference to the Syrian people.
8171 2018-11-24 21:12:01 if China digs oil in WPS w/o any signed agreements, will U stop them?........ hahaha
8172 2018-11-24 21:11:56 My mom picked me up from my oil change in a beanie and big ass glasses.... look like she was about to rob kum&go smh
8173 2018-11-24 21:11:54 Oil as weapon not enough! Now they want nuclear weapons
8174 2018-11-24 21:11:53 I bot small amount of oil futures contract. We'll see¯\_(ツ)_/¯
8175 2018-11-24 21:11:44 fucking with someone who only moisturize with coconut oil got me thinking that’s the only way to nourish my body 
8176 2018-11-24 21:11:34 It's been a frustrating few days. I'm off here to make something to eat, watch some movies and knit. ;-) I'll STOP posting my t-shirt designs and CBD Oil and products, and go back to just making you all LAUGH. Have a great night everyone.
8177 2018-11-24 21:11:13 Starting my hair journey... with a deep condition(eggs,mayo,honey and coconut oil) this morning . Took my biotin and added my earthly desires leave in treatment ,

8180 2018-11-24 21:10:44 2018 BIG TEN EAST CHAMPIONS!! All Roads now to Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis next Saturday against Northwestern! Onward to Victory! #GoBuckeyes O-H!
8181 2018-11-24 21:10:42 Sneaky Stuff! Avocado oil, plus canola and soybean and sugar...
(We do have a Healthy Mayo Guide on our site that’s worth checking out, btw).
8182 2018-11-24 21:10:39 Lmao the caravan didn't do this Saudi Arabia's Prince had this done to a Washington post journalist this didn't even have anything to do with the Caravan but Trump isn't doing anything about it he's more interested in their oil than the murder of a innocent journalist whatSHAME
8183 2018-11-24 21:10:38 Muh climate change as their obsession with cheap boxed and takeout food fuels the palm oil industry that will send the orangutan to extinction in the wild in another decade or two.
8184 2018-11-24 21:10:28 Still remember back in 2015, everything is tied to oil price. Oil-hyg-indices...probably we are seeing this again soon...
8185 2018-11-24 21:10:27 Scottish independence for me has never been about oil (keep it in the ground I say) but the unionists/BBC weaponised this in 2014.  They lied about #ClairRidge and they did so intentionally #usethemandate
8186 2018-11-24 21:10:19 Same here and also use Copaiba oil
8187 2018-11-24 21:10:16 Nice to know Wahhabism extremism didn’t spread to the Western oil people they ran into who went over there or anything.
8188 2018-11-24 21:10:11 @MBarnes33 hey, about Lucas Oil in Indy. Remember what I told you in June

8190 2018-11-24 21:09:57 In the run up to the indy vote Westminster mps told us the oil was running out

8192 2018-11-24 21:09:24 Every American president since the oil crisis in the 60’s or 70’s (can’t remember) has done deals with SA and done everything the could to keep them sweet. Difference is trump says it. An article in The Intercept explains it a lot better
8193 2018-11-24 21:09:11 Under the Conservatives' watch, Alberta ignored #ClimateChange while #oilandgas failed to diversify to #cleanenergy, didn't force corporations to clean up their mess, didn't provide for workers in the case of a drop in oil prices, allowed profits to be hidden off shore.
8194 2018-11-24 21:09:10 When you were shite and before you were founded with oil money
8195 2018-11-24 21:09:09 islamic faith has no place here in our christian nation. its like oil and water. islam is an intolerant religion. none for women, gays, or non islamic faiths. that makes almost everyone an enemy. they will infiltrate and try to take us over or worse. speak up now.

- Schick Intuition Sensitive Care Razor
- Vaseline Radiant Body Gel
- Nivea In-Shower Cocoa Butter Lotion
- Vaseline Cocoa Butter Lotion

8197 2018-11-24 21:08:47 Debt and low oil prices is definitely going to be the wet blanket for shale, assuming low oil prices persist. I'm in the camp for rebound to $75 WTI by Jan.
8198 2018-11-24 21:08:44 Is it the Tarte Maracuja oil?
8199 2018-11-24 21:08:33 This peppermint Jamaican Castor Oil has my scalp feeling so good!
I also poured 2 cap fulls into my bath water and it has my skin so smooth and soft
8200 2018-11-24 21:08:16 Foreign money like the billion in the oil industry?
8201 2018-11-24 21:08:11 Walmart’s Auto place is about to be a war zone w all these mad bitches waiting 6 hours on their on sale tires  I was the only one there for an oil change
8202 2018-11-24 21:08:04 Your Conservative loving oil/gas darling  Kinder Morgan bailed on the project, mostly due to lack of customers offshore.
8203 2018-11-24 21:08:03 Some things I do to feel good in my skin: I take a bath. I do a slow shave in the tub. I rub my body with coconut oil. I do a face mask and let my skin breathe. I let my hair air dry. I put on sexy lingerie that no one has ever seen me in and I take a bunch of selfies
8204 2018-11-24 21:08:01 go to NPR headline, Saudi Arabia's Ambitious Overhaul Hinges on Reducing it's Oil Addiction. (not)
8205 2018-11-24 21:07:57 Every time I get an oil change, I leave the dealership feeling like a got a new car. I swear the car feels smoother. 
8206 2018-11-24 21:07:49 This is why oil prices are dropping, not Trump.
8207 2018-11-24 21:07:45 What "cleaner energy sources?' You people killed the nuclear (or as most liberals say, "nuke-you-lar") power industry, and other sources cannot provide our needs. We will ALWAYS have a need for oil and gas. That's a fact. And coal must factor in as well.
8208 2018-11-24 21:07:14 Shea moisture, carols daughter, olive oil & shea butter
8209 2018-11-24 21:06:44 And yet michigan will be sitting on the couch watching next weekend along with Michigan State. Difference is MSU has actually seen the inside of Lucas Oil Stadium
8210 2018-11-24 21:06:39 I want to rub oil all over him
8211 2018-11-24 21:06:35 Pipelines are a dead end. Long-term price of oil is headed down, down, down. Expensive tar sands oils will be out of the money well before new pipelines can pay for themselves
8212 2018-11-24 21:06:31 I’m so glad I married a handy man! Hubs is changing the oil on our car right now! Last month out in a pet door.
8213 2018-11-24 21:06:28 Anti oil sands leader. No pipeline for Canada under Trudeau’s liberals
8214 2018-11-24 21:06:22 This is ghetto. If he ain’t bringing the new jar of coconut oil then does he really respect you?
8215 2018-11-24 21:06:21 Ain’t nobody holding there breath except opposing defenses when Tua runs Gary so please Shut up!
8216 2018-11-24 21:06:00 This is such stupidity. How do you explain Trudeau’s bill C-48 - the moratorium on oil tankers on the north coast? There’s no grey area here; Trudeau killed it with your support. He didn’t say, re-do consultation, he straight up killed it. Facts are a stubborn thing.
8217 2018-11-24 21:05:22 TRUMPS LIFE IS A LIE FEST & JUST LOOK AT THE MESS WE HAVE HERE IN AMERICA BECAUSE TRUMP THE SNAKE OIL SALESMAN SOLD A BILL OF GOODS THAT SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY BELIEVED
8218 2018-11-24 21:05:20 Hitler's war machine was running low on oil and gas as well, he needed the oil fields down at ... oh, I forget the name at the moment ... anyway, he needed those oil fields as well
8219 2018-11-24 21:05:17 I was just going to ask if you oil it!  Tray adding a few drops of rosemary and lavender oil to your products
8220 2018-11-24 21:05:02 Lmao the sky daddy isnt doing me any favors guess I gotta go find some coconut oil
8221 2018-11-24 21:04:54 It really is less of a #GusBus and more of a ‘77 Ford Pinto with no A/C, an oil leak, and three spare tires on at this point.
8222 2018-11-24 21:04:22 Essential oils (cedar oil>all else)= inexpensive cologne
8223 2018-11-24 21:04:20 That’s so crazy! Luckily we’ve been using oil as of lately.
8224 2018-11-24 21:04:12 Saw a 6.4 powerstroke white smoking and yelled out the window of my perfectly running 7.3 “ouch town population you bro!” I got the finger back but atleast my truck isn’t eat it’s own oil while I drive. It just leaks it out . #powerstroke

Plain and pure disaster
8231 2018-11-24 21:03:14 Bury it because...? CEO's and Industry, OIL and Business tycoons will lose money reinstating stronger regulations? Is his ignoring climate change and global warming and all the data because ... he CAN? Putin would? Kim would ?Salman would?Is it because it is a criticism him?
8232 2018-11-24 21:02:58 NATIONAL EDITOR 
EXPLAIN HERE AND NOW WHERE ALL THE REVENUE WILL GO?
HOW MUCH OF IT WILL GO INTO A SCOTLAND OIL FUND?
OR WILL WESTMINSTER ELITE BUY MORE CHAMPAGNE TO CELEBRATE THEIR NEW MONEY TAKEN FROM SCOTLAND?
8233 2018-11-24 21:02:54 This is how Iranian oil shipments dodge the US sanctions.
8234 2018-11-24 21:02:34 Oil and Power make strange bedfellows.

But before either of them can be top dog - Saudia Arabia needs to be contained. Same for Israel.

Then they can fight it out between themselves.
8235 2018-11-24 21:02:30 Did you know natural PB is better for you because it doesn’t have added oils and sugar but you can also get an arm workout stirring the natural oil separation 
8236 2018-11-24 21:02:22 Oil perfumes 12ml for N1500,50ml for N3500,100ml for 7000..sprays 50ml for 1500,100ml for 3000
8237 2018-11-24 21:02:14 I'm being a little sarcastic but also serious. How do you finance this change? The government should stop paying subsidies to oil companies and take those monies and start R&D for power sources than fossil fuels?  Do you pay South American countries to stop cutting trees?

8241 2018-11-24 21:01:27 Well you know the republicans/Putin/Koch/trump are full of gas,I mean in gas and oil. If climate change was not about that I bet they would be all for fighting it.

8250 2018-11-24 21:00:52 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
8251 2018-11-24 21:00:49 multiple oil changes on tour sucks ass man
8252 2018-11-24 21:00:46 Didn’t she tried to harm her already, that hot oil spilled on Zara ‘s clothes when Rukhsar was fighting with Aman for chocolate
8253 2018-11-24 21:00:41 Exactly. Chilli, thyme, cranberries. What in common? American produce & all over cookery shows. Oh, & pouring oil over food. Don't watch cooking progs. any more. +blueberries. Look for them in nearly all shows. 
8254 2018-11-24 21:00:30 France just became 1st Country not approve new oil exploration there. There's a global effort towards this push! I'm very concerned US will be pushed into this. Can anything be done to ensure globalisation isn't implemented here?
8255 2018-11-24 21:00:27 The internet says use coconut oil but I say develop a relationship to god and pray for it to come off
8256 2018-11-24 21:00:26 Macron and Trudeau frauds who aren't lowering emissions. Importing oil from Russia & mining in Africa doesn't count as lowering emissions, Macron. Your buddy Justin is equally dumb; he thinks shutting down Canadian oil & being dependent on foreign oil somehow makes us virtuous.
8257 2018-11-24 21:00:26 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
8258 2018-11-24 21:00:13 Ah, sorry fair point, my bad, no palm oil peanut butter?

8260 2018-11-24 21:00:03 Should have put some emu oil on it... my hubby and I keep it in the kitchen and if we get burned and apply right away, there is not even a blister
8261 2018-11-24 21:00:02 We all can't funnel oil money into their club, like them. I will still say they are a class team, an as much as it pains me..Liverpool. United have been run into the ground by the suits up top.
8262 2018-11-24 21:00:01 I'd rather stop subsidies to big oil.  I'd prefer them going to photovoltaic shingles and paint.
8263 2018-11-24 20:59:46 caught a whiff of jimmy choo man and now I need it in the oil lol
8264 2018-11-24 20:59:28 Nooooo! It’s not against the rise of the gas, It’s not about oil, it’s about taxes & income-tax, and the difference between normal people and rich who pay no taxes in france. Be real journalist, make ur job for god  sake!
8265 2018-11-24 20:59:27 My mom was just reading a cookies recipe and one of the ingredients was extra virgin olive oil 
BITCH I DIED LAUGHING REMEMBERING THE VIDEO JSDHDHBD
8266 2018-11-24 20:59:21 Why till the oil is flowing . Stop it altogether.
8267 2018-11-24 20:59:18 Usually when we fry turkeys we fry 4-6 of them and then I take the oil to Houston biodiesel in the heights. This thing works just fine, less hassle.

8272 2018-11-24 20:58:18 It almost seems as though the perpetual tensions in the Middle East are tied to oil futures.
8273 2018-11-24 20:58:07 Ooh no palm oil, that bad
8274 2018-11-24 20:57:58 I’ve used the same oil for 4 years. Can reuse as long as you don’t burn it
8275 2018-11-24 20:57:57 I hate changing the oil smh
8276 2018-11-24 20:57:53 I hate and love Christmas time. I hate the creatures that humans become when I’m trying to go to Walmart for motor oil. But I love the tamales and birria we make at home while enjoying the cold weather. But I hate the weight gain 
8277 2018-11-24 20:57:43 I made a seasoned flour with smoked paprika coated sticks of halloumi (1 pack made about 10-12), then shallow fried in sunflower oil for a couple of mins, turning until crispy all over. Made a couple of dips then stuffed my face.
8278 2018-11-24 20:57:43 Talk to me when y’all make it Lucas Oil stadium.
8279 2018-11-24 20:57:38 Gotta love it when dad comes back home after i vaped it all.
- Whoah! At least this one doesn't smell like motor oil
8280 2018-11-24 20:57:24 هيدا ازا كان في وفا ..
8281 2018-11-24 20:57:20 1/1 The #Petrocaribe agreement, which #Haiti signed in 2006, allowed the Haitian government to buy oil from #Venezuela, pay sixty per cent of the purchase price within ninety days, and then defer the rest of the debt, at a one-per-cent interest rate, over twenty-five years.
8282 2018-11-24 20:57:19 If only we could get shipping to stop using dirty sulphur rich oil then we’d have all modes covered.
8283 2018-11-24 20:57:18 Getting my oil changed, they better not ask me bout my tires, or nothing
8284 2018-11-24 20:57:08 For sure! 
Anonymous reports UN handouts of 100m to leaders supporting UN Agendas ?
Saudis have funded Washington for years ... so UnaOil Style payments? for preferring Saudi oil?
American 1% funding anti Canadian Oil through Tides etc are also a source ?
Find ??
Let’s end this
8285 2018-11-24 20:57:06 Harvard’s Nicholas Burns  calls Trump’s statement “beyond embarrassing. It is shameful. He cites uncritically the MBS smear that Khashoggi was a traitor. He argues the U.S. can’t afford to alienate Riyadh due to oil+Iran.He is silent on our most important interest Justice.”
8286 2018-11-24 20:57:05 Where do you live? I’m paying about 2.35. It’s all artificially high and has been since Katrina. Oil companies make a profit every quarter.
8287 2018-11-24 20:57:04 Peanut Oil cost like $30 a container and you need 1.5 containers and I don’t feel like frying 4 turkeys today.
8288 2018-11-24 20:57:03 What? Huh? Oil? Who said something about Oil.. bitch you cooking?..
8289 2018-11-24 20:56:37 I know, right! My son hasn’t got any but my daughter who’s 5 she seems to get them a lot, we have tried tea tree oil and conditioners and citronella spray but it doesn’t help that some parents don’t treat their kids so it comes back  x
8290 2018-11-24 20:56:36 Educate myself with the biggest global warming denier who is supported by big oil?
8291 2018-11-24 20:56:20 The Igbo strong ,oil they your plug head 
8292 2018-11-24 20:56:11 Well, here is how stupid you are...when the price of oil drops like it's dropping now, thousands of American oil industry workers lose their jobs! THAT is how smart you're NOT!
8293 2018-11-24 20:56:05 And the president accepts lower oil prices, like its an exchange for the reporters life.
8294 2018-11-24 20:56:01 I'm genuinely quite UNimpressed at the volume of journos & unionists who poo-pooed any talk of these 'secret oil fields' when they were told of them back in 2014, & who are not now offering apologies for lies, deceit & jeers of 'tin foil hat wearers' to those they maligned...
8295 2018-11-24 20:55:55 It’s like arguing oil spills are beneficial because of the cleanup jobs they create.
8296 2018-11-24 20:55:55 We have not cut down on the pollutants at all, only changed some to less visible form. But we are still chugging through oil, coal, forests, fires and natural resources in an alarming way. If we could stop our consumption completely we would a gradual improvement.
8297 2018-11-24 20:55:51 

この結果は後々の世界にとって、重くのしかかるかも

8298 2018-11-24 20:55:49 We also need to emphasise the sustainability of wool; there are many who will choose the faux version as they believe that shearing is wrong or for other reasons. Faux wool is an abomination in my world, yet another oil based product.

8301 2018-11-24 20:55:29 “Oil and gas companies” is her name. And she’s staring at @elonmusk
8302 2018-11-24 20:55:17 Forrest clearing due to palm oil use has been happening for decades. BTW, Palm oil adds flavor but is loaded with saturated fat.
8303 2018-11-24 20:55:12 It’s not rocket science... you crack your eggs into a bowl, season them accordingly, add bit of oil/ butter to ur pan then pour ur eggs in..
8304 2018-11-24 20:55:05 Michigan fans will never know what the inside of Lucas Oil Stadium looks like 
8305 2018-11-24 20:55:01 “Think” and “Republican” are two words that mix together like oil and water.
8306 2018-11-24 20:54:57 Japan killed 750 people in the primitive Andaman Islands as they withdrew at the end of WWII, so we should probably recall our ambassador from Tokyo while we punish Saudi Arabia for their messy assassination in Turkey. Oil at $400 per barrel and a second Great Depression! Hurrah!
8307 2018-11-24 20:54:56 I’ve heard that tea tree oil works!
8308 2018-11-24 20:54:48 Furthermore gas prices were not cut by Trump - the US is pumping more oil, along with the rest, and there is more supply than demand.
8309 2018-11-24 20:54:46 Emily oil dear
8310 2018-11-24 20:54:41 Spurs’ and Liverpool’s best starts to a PL season and we’re still trailing the oil barons with their bottomless pit of money and non existent/shite support. They advertise tickets for PL/CL games on Talksport and still can’t sell their stadium out, you couldn’t make it up !!
8311 2018-11-24 20:54:30 Ketos, one tree hill, and an oil blend for my sore back. Yep, it's conference prep szn 
8312 2018-11-24 20:54:19 That's good. They just live in the ocean for free, so put em to work. Plastic is made from oil, and oil is natural.
8313 2018-11-24 20:54:18 I need someone to come with me to change my oil
Damn you @pruttynpink87 you live so far
8314 2018-11-24 20:54:09 Note to self: Do not put your hands anywhere near your eyes, let alone rub them, when you have just used Olbas Oil!  #iwonderwhatmyguidedogwillbecalled
8315 2018-11-24 20:54:02 'cept that his statements on psychology et al are largely debunked by actual professionals. He's a snake oil salesman that preaches what's easy to understand, not what's actually functional or helpful.
8316 2018-11-24 20:54:02 So.. I have 3 girls. All of them with hair to their waists. We just went through this in Sept. I put tea tree oil in their shampoo now to help repel them. As if parenting wasn’t hard enough.. we have to fight critters too! Ugh
8317 2018-11-24 20:53:53 @GarnierUK claiming your new coconut oil shampoo is vegan but you're not cruelty free as brand? explain pls
8318 2018-11-24 20:53:49 had hot oil splash in my eye today. can confirm it's more painful than lemon juice
8319 2018-11-24 20:53:43 Alert, "gov" is buying additional pressure! International investors will buy never (ever!) sold before stock in Saudi oil company Aramaco to increase the number of influential people who have skin in this lawsuit.
8320 2018-11-24 20:53:32 Helping oil the wheels of industry so to speak
8321 2018-11-24 20:53:25 Iran has oil too  in case you don’t know.
8322 2018-11-24 20:53:20 Pair that with the constant narrative that governments, especially Liberal ones, are “elites” and not “real people”, along with academics, scientists, teachers, and labour unions...all laughing at and looking down on oil workers, farmers, and anybody from the West.
8323 2018-11-24 20:53:19 Put vegetable oil in the batter no need to butter the pan
8324 2018-11-24 20:53:07 This guys peppermint oil at work is giving me life right now
8325 2018-11-24 20:53:02 The thing is, electing Trump out of frustration about economic inequality & political corruption is like electing the Koch Brothers out of frustration about oil dependence.
8326 2018-11-24 20:52:35 It’s not a cause - it’s the planet and all the life on it. And logic would tell you “if I’m right but I go along w/ their plan, the only thing bad that will happen is some oil billionaires make less and the planet is healthier but if I’m wrong and push against it -disaster”.
8327 2018-11-24 20:52:32 I hope you get one. Low class oil trash has some qulity products.
8328 2018-11-24 20:52:28 Oil and water dont mix. This is a chess board having pieces put in postion.
8329 2018-11-24 20:52:27 @realDonaldTrump China Trade War, Higher Int Rates are a big drag on the economy. Hiker Powell is clueless at the Fed. Democrat Socialists will win more in 2020 if these aren't reversed soon. Re-election won't happen if the economy sours. Low Oil Prices only good before elections
8330 2018-11-24 20:52:21 I walked into O’Reilly and bought my own power steering fluid + oil, a queer/masc king #masc4masc
8331 2018-11-24 20:52:20 These so called climatologists are the same folks that want us to believe that oil comes from dinosaurs- yes dinosaurs!
8332 2018-11-24 20:52:20 no the for doing dabs on oil rig
8333 2018-11-24 20:52:04 Crude oil was $44.07 on Election Day 2016. It was most recently $50+ down from over $74 during this administration. We purchase 40% from Canada and less than 10% from the Saudis. DipshiT is owned by the Russians and the Saudis because no American banks will lend to his companies.
8334 2018-11-24 20:51:56 معليه هيدا حقه يلي بده يتنازل يتنازل من عنده مش من جيبة غيره المسيحي شريك المسلم بالوطن ولن يكون تابع بعد اليوم والا فيدرالية وخلصونا يلي التا النا ويلي الكم الكم ونقطة عا السطر ٤٠ سنة اكلتو حقوقنا ونهب لنبان يكفي ونقطة عا السطر
8335 2018-11-24 20:51:49 OH YEAH I remember reading about this a million years ago. They use used motor oil for things like cooked chicken too and glue for milk in cereal
8336 2018-11-24 20:51:48 Look, if I did not use CBD to ease my pain, I would very likely be addicted to opioids so you can keep your rationale about safety and I will keep taking my oil.
8337 2018-11-24 20:51:45 Have you tried stuff? If not hot tea and honey.
Standing in the hottest shower you can stand with some vaperub or eucalyptus soap/oil around your chest and if oil pour some into the bottom of the shower and steam yourself.
Also deffo meds/ numbing sprays
8338 2018-11-24 20:51:29 We put gas and oil in the snowblower. Good times!
8339 2018-11-24 20:51:24 Pretty fair to say, that some of these "Environment" groups in the states, that are fighting Canada from building pipelines to our coasts, are probably just doing so to keep cheap oil flowing to the states. #oilsands
8340 2018-11-24 20:51:24 This summer the US because the worlds largest oil producer again, it was number one last century as well.  This impacts geopolitics and the economy, but most people don’t know this.
8341 2018-11-24 20:51:13 Gees France puts a couple quid on petrol and the French go beserk rioting and tearing up the Champs Elysee.  England sells off Scotland's Fish & Oil and they're like.. gees that's not fair England we don't even want to leave EU and you're making us bend over and suffer for it.
8342 2018-11-24 20:51:07  hope them boys can sell a harbor ship load of snake oil on the trail. Smoke & mirrors and all that.
8343 2018-11-24 20:50:49 is nd when he gave up his job on the oil rig... Oh and when JJ went to jail and she wanted James to borrow from some Loan Sharks
8344 2018-11-24 20:50:49 It is beyond the capability of science to know how much humans change climate or to make climate predictions 50yrs out. We were told by “science” that we would hit peak oil by 1970.
8345 2018-11-24 20:50:45 Actually it is not that complicated. By the year 2000 corruption was already a clear fact. It became overwhelming with the rise of oil prices. But already "plan Bolivar 2000" gave us the foreword.
But then again very few wanted to see it.
8346 2018-11-24 20:50:40 Nooooooo.....the oil...boom? Has sent the prices just skyrocketing.  My mother moved back into the area about a year ago and trying to find housing was a nightmare. Housing with indoor plumbing.
8347 2018-11-24 20:50:28 Is sanctioning Saudi Arabia or worse worth the destruction of the Petro-Dollar system and therefore our entire economy?  This isn't about just oil prices, it's about world wide demand for the dollar as the world's reserve currency.  Do you want all dollars to be worthless?
8348 2018-11-24 20:50:02 Did you know that Jeff was kicked out of CNN for allegedly raping a fellow workers(lady), did you also know that Jeff is married to a Muslim woman and they have a son? 
Did you also know that CS Balala is married to a very rich Qatari woman whose father is an Oil, billionaire?
8349 2018-11-24 20:49:49 @A_Esmaiel85 تستاهل كل خير وفخر لنا جميعا والله يوفقك
8350 2018-11-24 20:49:44 An excellent example of the Oil sector trash (their words) that make up my base and I didn't even have to promise anything for these two.
8351 2018-11-24 20:49:42 just so you have your facts straight. Donald Trump tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saud
8352 2018-11-24 20:49:32 Brexit isn't a right wing crusade. It's a bunch of lies dreamed up by some snake oil politicians.

Most people will be glad its all over.
8353 2018-11-24 20:49:21 My dad was the same way.  We all learned to drive stick in an old 1960s dodge pickup truck.  He made us learn how to change our own oil and tires too.  We couldn't get our licences otherwise.
8354 2018-11-24 20:49:15 Back in primary school, the oil on my stew spilled and stained my flack, then a guy (my classmate) gave me his white handkerchief to wipe my flask clean! Over 10 years ago...
8355 2018-11-24 20:49:05 半botだから、話しかけてね＼(^o^)／基本リプは返します＼(^o^)／オイルトークしようね＼(^o^)／
8356 2018-11-24 20:49:04 According to a report from @NASA , the best way to produce sulfate aerosols is from ... the burning of coal and oil!!!!

So the cause of climate change is also the cure.

And rather than spending money,  just deregulate smokestacks and belch that crap into the atmosphere!  ;)
8357 2018-11-24 20:49:03 Oil master. You carry on like this and you may well become an honoury member of the eyes :)
8358 2018-11-24 20:48:44 America firsters, what if we embraced clean energy investments (jobs), & also realized that climate change affects the rest of the world AND (wait for it), America . Although, we'd also have to acknowledge that the U.S. exports oil #1, so ask yourself why some deny that path?
8359 2018-11-24 20:48:38 I saw that BP drilling in the Clyde near BBC Scotland once. All hushed up now but oil was gushing clear as day
8360 2018-11-24 20:48:33 Having the ability to sell our oil to other markets would make us competitive. You clearly have zero concept of economics. Ladies and gentlemen, your gender studies degree hard at work.
8361 2018-11-24 20:48:30 You have oil money. That’s the fact. You can change your country’s ugly history by that though.
8362 2018-11-24 20:48:23 Still to high if your a roughneck and lose your job due to low oil prices
8363 2018-11-24 20:48:13 Make it clear, I hope this so called story involve more than half a dozen oil companies other wise I shall call this fake news hype. Note I will give credit when credit is due, but, if this is just a couple or three companies that burnt a financial outfit big deal!
8364 2018-11-24 20:48:08 Trump might be rejoicing at falling oil prices, but last time oil dropped in 2014-16, it was because the world economy was slowing down + demand had fallen. Oil is dropping on concerns over the tariffs, as well as rising supply. History would suggest Trump should tread carefully.
8365 2018-11-24 20:48:05 Soviet Union stressed Nation for Oil Price Fallen
8366 2018-11-24 20:47:52 Didn’t we have our Xmas dins straight after when Amy poured oil all over the floor 
8367 2018-11-24 20:47:47 Hey do you think we could get @DevinDVote to ask his good friend and ally @realDonaldTrump to stop dumping cheap shale oil on the market?  I can't find him is he in the men's room again?
8368 2018-11-24 20:47:38 The Michigan Defense has been complete exposed. It is leaking major oil. Jim Harbaugh will be 0-4 vs Ohio States as Head Coach Of Michigan. The rumbling will be loud in Ann Arbor for Harbaugh to go. 0-4 vs Ohio State DOES NOT cut it among Michigan supporters.
8369 2018-11-24 20:47:19 This guy must be working in an oil company
8370 2018-11-24 20:47:15 @222Minutes 
What do you think the liberals plan is, once all the small businesses close, all resources workers (mining, forestry and oil) all leave and farmers shut down their operations? Who’s going to do the actual work? Everyone can’t be a barista.
8371 2018-11-24 20:46:59 ออยไม่ยอมฟังเลิฟบอมกับลาวีอองโรส เสียใจ...
8372 2018-11-24 20:46:50 Which oil comapny is not investing in "green" technologies?  Which "oil company" is still simply oil only?
8373 2018-11-24 20:46:23 i saw a doc where a guy made his car run on fry oil so this could work
8374 2018-11-24 20:46:17 @Exmarkmowers My elderly neighbor has an Ex-Mark Quest serial number 313646577 and asked me to check an oil leak.  The mower has 140 hours.  I found the right hydro pump is leaking where the linkage attaches.  That pump is $1000.  Surely, based on the hours you can help them.
8375 2018-11-24 20:46:15 It had to be a group of Republicans bc the Democrats are smart enough to know most of our oil came from Canada and very little from the Trump sanctioned SA murderers.
8376 2018-11-24 20:46:13 Ohio State is going to play in the BIG TEN Championship game against Northwestern next Saturday in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium #MICHvsOSU
8377 2018-11-24 20:46:13 Guys I urge you when buying products of any kind, flip it over, read the ingredients and if it has palm oil don’t buy it, find an alternative
8378 2018-11-24 20:46:11 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
8379 2018-11-24 20:46:05 Please bear in mind SA supplies only 11% of US oil imports. Crediting them for low oil prices doesn't make sense since they have already said they will be lowering OPEC PRODUCTION in January.
8380 2018-11-24 20:46:01 Try clove oil!
8381 2018-11-24 20:45:59 It’s not hard when you put nonstick spray or oil on the skillet mindy 
8382 2018-11-24 20:45:56 Actually higher taxes on gas, goes to the government  (ideally for investment in renewable energy ) and not to Billionaires. Less oil would be purchased
8383 2018-11-24 20:45:52 And oil change 
8384 2018-11-24 20:45:52 imagine thinking i’m gonna go get my oil changed can my dad catapult back to illinois and do it for me i’m sick
8385 2018-11-24 20:45:49 Applying the waves product and beard oil
8386 2018-11-24 20:45:47 Its either about pleasing the World Bank & IMFor punishing the  poor people.Started with the poor who could not get money in the banks(2%for using plastic money), then motorists($700 fine for sitbelt), what next,probably taxing those found queuing for fuel,cooking oil, sugar etc?
8387 2018-11-24 20:45:42 When you are so corrupt and inept that you steal the pennies needed to buy feed for the goose that lays the golden eggs = Venezuela state oil company.
8388 2018-11-24 20:45:40 Well here i am a dumb liberal female who knows how to change the oil/batteries/plugd + wires/tires/head gasket on 2 vehicles, an rv (2 batteries mind you= super scary ;-) ) don't forget riding lawnmower... college degree, 19 urs at current job...
8389 2018-11-24 20:45:32 Not true you are quoting from GERS which simply apportions the UK national debt.  In fact Scotland is the ONL:Y part of the UK which has a trading surplus and hasd done for many years before NS Oil.
8390 2018-11-24 20:45:20 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8391 2018-11-24 20:45:15 @SaturdayRTE our ecinomy only recovers as the global economy recovers..then is destroyed whenever there's a glitch. Oil and gas handed away no taxes..answer to every issue is tax. No more FF FG axis please they ran out of ideas 30 yrs ago
8392 2018-11-24 20:45:13 Why is it forbidden to question islam and ok for them to treathen who ever they want? 

Let me tell you why, corrupted oil money politicians selling us out threatening the future and security  of our world for a dime more.
8393 2018-11-24 20:45:07 Ooo thank you!! I’ve heard good stuff about Castor oil 
8394 2018-11-24 20:44:56 @NancyPelosi That’s why the DNC is taking oil PAC money again? Support Medicare for all and a livable minimum wage. Spare us the bs Nancy and investigate the Trump crime family instead of taking everything off the table!
8395 2018-11-24 20:44:52 @IvankaTrump China Trade War, Low Oil Prices, Higher Interest Rates are a big drag on the economy. Hiker Powell is clueless at the Fed. Leftist Democrat  Socialists  will win more in 2020 if these are not reversed soon. Re-election won't happen if the economy sours more.
8396 2018-11-24 20:44:49 @backstrom19 ...... those hands massaging olive oil gently into warm pi..... what was the question?
8397 2018-11-24 20:44:44 Impact Man knocked out Oil Man and it was super effective!
8398 2018-11-24 20:44:40 I've heard Caster Oil helps.

8400 2018-11-24 20:44:23 Tell them to look at the price of oil.  The Tsunami will be in bankruptcies.  Shale cowboys never learn.
8401 2018-11-24 20:44:20 When they switch ships to low sulfur bunker oil, that will eliminate a big source of cooling.
8402 2018-11-24 20:44:18 MCFC promoted by oil.
8403 2018-11-24 20:44:16 I want to switch sectors so bad. What’s happening in the oil and gas industry?
8404 2018-11-24 20:44:06 You're kidding, right? Every economy in the world would collapse without oil plus you couldn't fly anywhere!
8405 2018-11-24 20:44:04 Yes. Now I can holla at my NY-rican fam but I'm like almost certain  since my side of the fam stayed in the West Indies.. we only do the  olive oil and never even finish on top with butter. I'm certain it's the  African-American.
8406 2018-11-24 20:43:49 Don’t even talk to me until I’ve had my morning half-bottle of CBD oil
8407 2018-11-24 20:43:46 * He will claim that the low oil prices & low unemployment, a strong economy (for now) are a tax break. With so many people now working & paying taxes they won't have to raise the taxes.
8408 2018-11-24 20:43:46 Tell then to look at the price of oil.  The Tsunami will be in bankruptcies.  Shale cowboys never learn.
8409 2018-11-24 20:43:32 Scotland has its debt, because the English took its oil and sold its fishing rights.

8411 2018-11-24 20:43:32 2007 traders expect $ printing, push oil to 150 2008 data shows 3% rise in money supply so they dump oil, actual panic of September 2008 they do print money but in a panic there is a strong demand for dollars as means of payment. This saves $
8412 2018-11-24 20:43:27 After watching Taggart for 12 games on the Oregon sideline I find this completely believable. When you give a snake oil salesman the keys to your program this is what you get. In @coach_cristobal we trust!

8417 2018-11-24 20:42:43 You know what I got my baby moms for Christmas? A tag for her car, wiper blades, and an oil change.
8418 2018-11-24 20:42:43 It’s an autopsy not an oil change
8419 2018-11-24 20:42:39 Including palm oil for Nutella Jar ?
8420 2018-11-24 20:42:25 I only fight girls naked in oil
8421 2018-11-24 20:42:19 The oil can't cover the benefits bill you have.
8422 2018-11-24 20:42:11 Why would oil companies spend so much money opposing climate change mitigation research, jobs, and infrastructure if they were secretly in cahoots?

What makes more sense is that oil companies know fixing climate change means reducing fossil fuels which they heavily invested in.

8425 2018-11-24 20:41:51 @sibasishb3 

On 5-10/10/2018

Crude oil price- $85/barrel
Conversion $1=₹73
In INR 85*73=₹6205/barrel

On 24/11/2018

Crude oil price- $60/barrel
Conversion $1=₹71
In INR 60*71=₹4260/barrel

Price reduction (6205-4260)/6205= 31.34%.

Red. in petrol prices is less than 10%.
8426 2018-11-24 20:41:41 Thank you distinguished Senator. I attended Clara Senior Secondary School situated in that community. Thank you for this intervention. @samsholss @JerryAkinyemi
8427 2018-11-24 20:41:25 To which you replied, "What *I* want for Christmas is for you to bring my car in for an oil change!" Win, win for everyone! =)
8428 2018-11-24 20:41:23 Tossers. Sorry, I am usually polite on Twitter but you just peddle myths and fake news  like a snake oil seller. Face up to reality. Education funding is at an all time low - post Industrial Revolution.
8429 2018-11-24 20:41:22 There's always a silver lining...Oil money will stop LFC winning the league. Can't be too complacent though..only one trophy makes us England's most successful club
8430 2018-11-24 20:41:17 @JacobAWohl doesn't know that Dems know the US gets 40% of her crude oil from CANADA, and about 2% from the thugs in Saudi Arabia. #FatNixon had nothing to do with any "reduction" in price, but they are both too stupid to realize
8431 2018-11-24 20:41:13 Why would they? There’s no Oil... or possibly other natural resources....

8437 2018-11-24 20:40:19 It was over a year later and because the Taliban was harboring Bin Laden. Had they given him up & agreed to destroy their terrorist training camps, we probably never would’ve gone in. I don’t see it as having to do with the opium poppies anymore than Iraq had to do with oil.

8446 2018-11-24 20:39:19 I'd say @imwithdick is a better choice since he can actually read and talk.
You should hear Maddox try to read the copy for the snake oil "natural hair growth" subscription service he shills for!
8447 2018-11-24 20:38:50 Maybe try using some of that 'no bite' clear nail polish on the ear piece?  Or spray tea tree oil on them?

8453 2018-11-24 20:37:33 Finally getting an oil change... Perhaps a trip to the carwash is next
8454 2018-11-24 20:37:27 Now, who is the boss of oil ??
8455 2018-11-24 20:37:25 But the market is far more complex than Trump suggests. Canada is actually the leading source of U.S. oil imports, for example, with Saudi Arabia second.
___
8456 2018-11-24 20:37:19 Don't forget to follow the money too. Lots of it from Big Agriculture, Big Pharma, oil and gas, real estate, and the finance industry. Mostly white men protecting the assets of other white men.

8458 2018-11-24 20:37:16 will depress energy demand.
Although the U.S. is now the world's biggest oil producer, Saudi Arabia remains the biggest exporter, and as a so-called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly, it can indeed influence the price of crude.
8459 2018-11-24 20:37:10 Clove oil as a temporary painkiller inside a bad tooth for toothache...
8460 2018-11-24 20:37:09 It could be vegetable oil too oga
8461 2018-11-24 20:36:58 And that’s only £11 a year if you do sensible thing and turn stuff off. BOL we are well aware that the oil radiator switched on in mum’s bathroom in the morning eats electric but it’s also coldest room in the house & she won’t get in bath without it!
8462 2018-11-24 20:36:56 Excuse my ignorance, but why would anyone increase oil exports when the world's supply is already high, currently?
8463 2018-11-24 20:36:53 THE FACTS: Merely thanking Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices is a gross oversimplification. Oil prices, which peaked Oct. 3, have been falling on the realization that U.S. sanctions against Iran would not create a shortage and on fear that slower economic growth internationally
8464 2018-11-24 20:36:34 My guess is it’s only for Baks 5 day break.  Oil in LA, Dal, LA.  Very convenient to Bak.  Better than Jesse alone for 5 days.
8465 2018-11-24 20:36:19 Also, POTUS doesn't have the authority to cut gas prices, which are dictated by the market? Granted, he could release barrels from the strategic oil reserve or cut gas taxes. Hate to break it to anyone who didn't know, but even POTUS can't just call BP and knock a few cents off.
8466 2018-11-24 20:36:11 One sixth of all jobs in Louisiana are in the oil and gas industry. Imagine how many more depend on it? Just because campaign donations are published and easily searchable doesn’t change the fact that politics is about votes.
8467 2018-11-24 20:36:10 His appointment of Tommy would have caused a day maybe twos worth of news, now it threatens to cause months worth of it during a potracted and bitter leadership fight, even if Gerard lit a fire this poured oil on it
8468 2018-11-24 20:35:57 Oh I don't like Lurpak. Unappealing colour. And the spreadable version isn't pure butter, as it's mixed with vegetable oil.

Just buy a block of butter.
8469 2018-11-24 20:35:47 We don't even have to call it climate change if that sounds disturbing. We can call it pollution, waste, destruction of earth's natural resources and blatant disregard for the nature of a wonderfully created planet. Oil spills, fracking and carbon emissions are not natural.
8470 2018-11-24 20:35:41 Needs more seasons of chatting to umpires to take that title!!! That’s like having one cooking oil wrestling match and saying he is the new Bertie!!!

8472 2018-11-24 20:35:36 I have a recipe for gluten-free brownies that your mom liked. I'll make them again for Christmas. Can you have: cornstarch, unsweetened cocoa powder, bitter or semi sweet choc, coconut oil, tahini, eggs, sugar (granulated & brown), kosher salt, vanilla extract, & agave nectar?
8473 2018-11-24 20:35:35 now we have a glut after experiencing a so called shortage , nothing more than crass market manipulation of a grand scale brokers make billions in comm , just when has there ever been a shortage '39-'45 World war was a blip , the oil was still there . Since then never !
8474 2018-11-24 20:35:32 The problem needs to be addressed at the source - literally. The oil companies still want to he in the oil business. What they need to learn is that they are actually in the ENERGY business. When they see things that way, then renewable energy will be commonplace.
8475 2018-11-24 20:35:25 Things I’ve been putting off getting my oil change getting new glasses getting my hair done going to the dentist and cleaning my car 
8476 2018-11-24 20:35:24 I see you're brainwashed into calling oil "fossil" fuels.  There's probably not much of a chance that you are really equipped with the scientific truth m
8477 2018-11-24 20:35:18 La Brea would have served a lot of nothing between Inglewood and Mid-City. Oil fields, a park, and single family homes. The current route is fine and should move west to Fairfax north of Expo
8478 2018-11-24 20:34:57 Putting a price on climate change (a.k.a. capitalism) seems to be the only way to fix this mess. The climate denier crowd (Trump and his oil and coal lobby) are not capitalists but rather lemon socialists!
8479 2018-11-24 20:34:42 Yes, when careers depend on research $ to study “climate change,” you can bet they’re going to find reasons to keep studying. The cycle continues. The studies in the 70’s on cooling and another recent BS Krugman prediction on peak oil were irrefutable, too. 
8480 2018-11-24 20:34:33 My "easily entertained" moment today:  watching a squirrel attempt to climb up the bird feeder pole, but helplessly slides down, since I sprayed it the crisco oil! #haha #gotchaSquirrel #funny #wildlife
8481 2018-11-24 20:34:32 You were dismissed as conspiracy nuts not because there was no oil but because there was no secret

8483 2018-11-24 20:34:25 This why I wait to the last possible min to get an oil change . I been at this dealership for the last 3.5 hours with a sick baby .  give me my car back !!

8487 2018-11-24 20:34:07 I don’t know that presidents could dictate world market oil prices and cut gas prices 
8488 2018-11-24 20:34:01 It’s not. The pipelines are the best & safest solution. However, in their naivety the left has stopped the pipelines forcing oil to the railway. Likely they are working on stopping this next. End result? Bankruptcy for Canada. Money leaves Canada & the left will hold the bills.
8489 2018-11-24 20:33:58 Big oil, gas and electric companies have been big donors to the republicans. This is why republicans are willing to look the other way as extreme weather conditions are causing massive problems and deaths to our country and around the world.
8490 2018-11-24 20:33:46 All vehicles require a certain amount & type of oil or the engine will burn out same goes for our spirit —- just any oil won’t do — we require #premium b/c we aren’t regular
8491 2018-11-24 20:33:42 Surely they must have been some type of oil or lubricants on that ground for all family members to go down.
8492 2018-11-24 20:33:31 （*＾ ワ ＾*）.... Did you eat my chili oil?
8493 2018-11-24 20:33:14 I got home at 2am to no oil and no heat in my house. Pipes were partially frozen and my toilet wasn't filling. I haven't slept for more than twenty minutes since yesterday morning. I may have also gotten hypothermic. Plus I'm at work until 5pm. So today has not been a good day.
8494 2018-11-24 20:33:04 Said to Bella yesterday > I’m sure some geniuses can put it to good use in inventive ways rather than carry on giving it away because of timing. The oil and gas industry are not going to stop drilling any time soon.
8495 2018-11-24 20:32:36 My brother Trump said the money is more important than the journalist Salman was not blind Salman gave a drop in oil bribe in exchange for silence Of course free oil better than the journalist
8496 2018-11-24 20:32:33 Like the oil and gas sheikhs who lie from the pulpit like Sudais , Erdogan is democratically elected, Turkey is a country based on the rule of law, while Saudi  Arabia believes in law of the jungle , MBS is the law ! He kills who he wants and detains who he wants
8497 2018-11-24 20:32:30 Personally, I don't recommend diet based on fat content. It's much easier to tell people forget all the macros but eat vegetables, fruits, whole intact grains, and legumes with 1-2 handfuls of nuts/seeds. No oil, no need to measure/count. Enjoy the bounty of #plantbased cuisine.
8498 2018-11-24 20:32:17 #UnitedNations 
The African continent is rich & poor at the same time .. Certainly rich in natural resources as they have the oil, gas, gold & diamonds .. However poor in management as most of the government GDP goes to the deep pockets.

8501 2018-11-24 20:31:39 It's nothing like a deep condition and hot oil treatment 
8502 2018-11-24 20:31:39 Could you get any closer to that oil heater 
8503 2018-11-24 20:31:34 This is an example of piss poor corporate culture. I work in Oil and Gas and no company I know would pull this shit. Because they know that anyone they tried it too would stand up for it. That's a healthier culture
8504 2018-11-24 20:31:24 "Catastrophe". It'll be funny watching all of the northeast freezing to death without heating oil. @nvisser
8505 2018-11-24 20:31:11 No, it's due to oil prices. You call everything that you don't like socialist
8506 2018-11-24 20:31:01 @BenSasse Why you're giving out opinions, what's your take on a 1st term guy, who takes PAC $, supports Big oil & NRA, is against gay marriage, equal pay, ACA, claims to not trust Trump, but votes MAGA 86+%, Votes to increase his pay,but "NO" on min. Wage increases? Is he lonely?
8507 2018-11-24 20:30:55 Gov't experts not paid by oil companies or Sierra club; they are honest working for us. Believe them, not the deniers or extremists.
8508 2018-11-24 20:30:45 Why do we have to 'integrate' everything / one? Some things are best left as they are. Why is the system being Big Brother. This isn't 1984! Most tribal integration means their habitat has oil/ minerals/ land! So just let them be! Including OUR FORESTS n THEIR WILD BEINGS!
8509 2018-11-24 20:30:39 Oil prices are going down in America , what's your problem Macron? Can't negotiate good deals ?
8510 2018-11-24 20:30:14 Macron mandou atacar as pessoas, as pessoas reagiram e o fuel oil incendiou Paris.
8511 2018-11-24 20:30:00 OPEC is set to meet on Dec. 6 in Vienna, but days earlier the key decision makers are set to gather on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires in a meeting that may well decide the direction of oil prices in 2019.
8512 2018-11-24 20:29:58 Burning oil.
They good with math.
8513 2018-11-24 20:29:58 nothing is ethical about canada's highly-subsidized, dirtiest and least efficient form of oil extraction. stick to cannabis oil talking points marc, this is all clearly well beyond your scope

8515 2018-11-24 20:29:41 Right now all assets are headed down, equities, crytpos, bonds, oil, gold, silver and real estate.  Which asset class do the bankers push back up and how would they do it?

8518 2018-11-24 20:29:22 He likes to pretend that he could walk into a hipster coffee shop and not be asked to leave, immediately. Most Democrats realize that 40% of our crude oil comes out of Canada, with less than 2% coming from the murdering thugs in Saudi Arabia, but he won't let facts get in the way
8519 2018-11-24 20:29:21 Oil of some sort maybe?
8520 2018-11-24 20:29:19 We get 40  percent  of our oil from Canada, but yet you treat Canadians so poorly while adoring the murdering Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. I guess it is who lines your pockets personally and bails you out who you bow to and enable.

8523 2018-11-24 20:28:59 I think a lot of the problems we have are , unfortunately, because of our parents generation.  We have known about global warming for decades but money/oil always comes first.

Being a Texan I understand their value of the oil/gas industry.  Their lack of education may doom us.
8524 2018-11-24 20:28:49 he’s got a job in the oil industry
8525 2018-11-24 20:28:36 Anyway, for this half now-boneless & skinless turkey breast, I think I will season it with Tony Chachere's, a sage poultry seasoning & maybe rub it with some garlic olive oil, pop it into a roasting bag and put it in the oven...   =)
8526 2018-11-24 20:28:33 USA imports very little Saudi oil. Imports more from Canada. This was about control of Middle East. USA has only 3 allies there. Saudi, Israel and AE.
8527 2018-11-24 20:28:32 Meanwhile, as all these frequent historic weather conditions cause massive problems and deaths in our country and around the world - Trump has stripped down the EPA to satisfy big oil and all the other big polluting companies that give monies to republicans.
8528 2018-11-24 20:28:27 my sense of humor has deteriorated so much that now the peak of humor to me is drawing a screaming face in the oil before I fry dumplings

8533 2018-11-24 20:27:43 Corrupt oil money can buy you titles but it can't buy you love...

8535 2018-11-24 20:27:29 And It continues to increase in January (gas oil)!
8536 2018-11-24 20:27:26 Look at oil.
8537 2018-11-24 20:27:25 there is a glut on oil - can't keep producing something folks  are moving away from using - Europe is going to ban gas cars shortly meanwhile more and more are living off grid or partially doing so
8538 2018-11-24 20:27:23 Sorry brother Allah zai maida mafi Alkairi
8539 2018-11-24 20:27:18 Il faut comprendre que ce n est plus la question. Avec le peak oil et les changements géopolitiques et la remise en cause du dollar, c est simplement la possibilité pour l occident d être servi en priorité  en produit pétrolier qui est remis en cause
8540 2018-11-24 20:27:17 Creed 2 while I get my oil changed
8541 2018-11-24 20:27:03 Wait!  Didn’t CNN just report the price of oil plunging???
8542 2018-11-24 20:27:01 i wanna pay sex workers to do vag studies w my oil paints but with what money.....
8543 2018-11-24 20:26:46 The other thing the article points to is that when people are looking for someone to tell them what they want to hear, then the oil MLM salesperson has an EASY sale & can string them along for a LONG time. #suckers
8544 2018-11-24 20:26:39 I'm in cake baking mode, and for 1st time looked at ingredients in stork, frosting, icing etc. All have large element of palm oil. #Rangtan
8545 2018-11-24 20:26:35 Given fact, Scorpio & Sagittarius are like oil & water
8546 2018-11-24 20:26:33 someone wanna tell me why @Jenna_Marbles sounds like Coach Steve from Big Mouth in the Snake Oil episode of the podcast??? I s2g every time I hear her talk like that it reminds me of that character @juliensolomita
8547 2018-11-24 20:26:29 daaah how many gallons of oil can I make,,,
8548 2018-11-24 20:26:28 Lower for longer — oil price to remain volatile...
8549 2018-11-24 20:26:27 hey  sports fans oil will have a 40 handle soon !!!

8550 2018-11-24 20:26:27 This vitamin e oil been getting rid of the dark spots on a real nigga face, still I rise.
8551 2018-11-24 20:26:08 I need to oil my scalp
8552 2018-11-24 20:26:06 Baba am devastated and depressed
8553 2018-11-24 20:26:04 I believe in 2016, oil bounced 50% higher in 50 days. I think you're falling for the media's BS a little too much. Go read all of HFIR's articles on SeekingAlpha and cheer up. Fundamentals will win and sentiment will turn. You will feel better as you do more research.
8554 2018-11-24 20:26:02 @SearsAuto so I'm at your Richmond California shop for an 11am appointment, the car doesn't go up on the rack until 12:15(after I asked for a status update) and less than 10 minutes later I'm getting a call for an upsell. Maybe have your guys finish the oil change first?
8555 2018-11-24 20:25:59 Oil is tanking last couple months
8556 2018-11-24 20:25:37 I cut my hair off soooooo, LOL but b4 i reached my brink and started over shea moistures Jamaican blacl castor oil leave in absorbs super quickly
8557 2018-11-24 20:25:21 Escuchando a los Chemical Brothers ?????
8558 2018-11-24 20:25:21 Still feeling deconditioned from the last week’s illness.
What a doozy. I can understand what drives people to seek miracle cures for wellness, even if they are snake oil.
8559 2018-11-24 20:25:09 Their economy ran almost entirely on oil sales, and when oil prices tanked, their economy went with it. It's the same thing that happened with coal in WV, and even dairy farming in my hometown of Kentwood, LA.
8560 2018-11-24 20:25:08 Lots of rich people on the side of the Gilet Jaunes. Oil industry stands to lose a lot from the Macron policy if it get copied else where.
8561 2018-11-24 20:25:06 Trump thanking Saudi Arabia for dropping Oil prices is a joke, the greatest beneficiary is China and not the U.S. consumer
8562 2018-11-24 20:25:05 I thought you had in mind of reviving the Kenya oil refinery plant in Changamwe?
It would refine crude oil from Turkana hence it would lower cost of production of livelihood to Kenyans
Create job opportunities and acquire LPG gas as a byproduct from the refining the crude oil.
8563 2018-11-24 20:25:02 Coconut oil can clog your pores, maybe try jojoba oil instead 
8564 2018-11-24 20:24:51 just spilled olive oil all over my stove... Will I Ever Find Peace?
8565 2018-11-24 20:24:50 TFW you order Chinese from BiteSquad but then prepare an immensely epicurian fire-roasted garlic, red pepper, Sriracha, lemon, olive oil, rice vinegar and soy sauce for your TAKEOUT DUMPLINGS THO
8566 2018-11-24 20:24:44 It's not inflation that is the problem clearly it's credit risk and deflation.  Industrial commodities and oil are in free fall.  We have far fewer tools to deal with deflation but they had better understand the difference before long.  #inflation #FederalReserve

8568 2018-11-24 20:24:36 I used to work with a woman who had an eye infection. One night she went to put her eye drops in before going to bed and she accidentally used the clove oil instead...
8569 2018-11-24 20:24:32 Roast some garlic on olive oil & smear it all on French bread. Drink green tea with ginger & honey & you'll be fine
8570 2018-11-24 20:24:16 Clove oil is the kindest way to euthanise a lot of aquarium fish. It's nasty stuff!
8571 2018-11-24 20:24:15 I am SO excited for the @camillerosenat nangai and tsubaki protein treatment. It's coconut oil freeeee! 
8572 2018-11-24 20:24:03 I accidentally spilled tea tree oil on my pants and my family is coming over... im not changing till someone says some shit ... f it
8573 2018-11-24 20:24:00 Wouldn't that be how peanut oil is made?
8574 2018-11-24 20:23:58 And, let's be frank, none of them are exactly oil paintings. Unless you include Jackson Pollock.
8575 2018-11-24 20:23:57 I’ve had my CBD oil for less than 24 hours and it has already calmed my anxiety down three separate times. I’m not saying it’s a miracle, but it might be
8576 2018-11-24 20:23:54 palm oil in vegan cooking is interesting! it sure does make everything taste like sunscreen!
8577 2018-11-24 20:23:49 indeed disgusting nothing is worse than shaken oil with raw egg yolk
8578 2018-11-24 20:23:41 In good news, I didn't spend nearly as much money as I thought I would have to today.

My oil change and inspection was half the price I thought it would.

so ah, yay?
8579 2018-11-24 20:23:37 1. When the Saints go marching in
2. Swing low
3. Give me oil in my lamp
8580 2018-11-24 20:23:37 You will at least need some Asian Store to get a few items for the guchujang Sauce. Korean red pepper paste (Gochujang), soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds and garlic. The rest is just rice, veggies, meat if u like and a fried egg is mandatory lol.
8581 2018-11-24 20:23:18 Fuck knows. Perhaps the point is that fossil fuels are apparently bad for the environment and many indy supporters had no idea. So, we should not be excited about extra oil. If we think indy Scotland should allow it to be extracted, there's hardly any point in indy.
8582 2018-11-24 20:23:06 Plus kulikuli oil...
8583 2018-11-24 20:22:43 BLUE SEAL from preliminary sketches

Oil and graphite on brown cardboard
8584 2018-11-24 20:22:37 I don't compare. I just said this for the metaphore, and, it's not a protest against the oil price, it's a protest against our president, against massive immigration, against tax for people who don't have money...etc.
8585 2018-11-24 20:22:24 We’re not dependent on oil from Mideast thanks to Trump’s policies, but having their oil keeps prices down. A dead Muslim Brotherhood Hamas sympathizer for cheap gas, I’ll take that trade
8586 2018-11-24 20:21:54 Lower Oil prices only hurts U S oil producers and helps China .
8587 2018-11-24 20:21:54 For the past several decades you should have been voting for politicians that actually had your interests in mind rather than being in the pocket of the oil industry. If you did, Alberta would have hundreds of billions in the bank that could help fund transition away from oil.
8588 2018-11-24 20:21:52 At this point in time I believe the majority of our oil comes from Canada. So, shouldn't we be more concerned over upsetting them w/Trump tariffs, rather than letting bluff from murdering Saudis (911 & Khashoggi) build an empty head of (Trump's favorite) steam?
8589 2018-11-24 20:21:46 (Puerto rican side)rice and butter as in butter IN your rice??? hmmm.... We do olive oil in rice.. while boiling the water.. I can't see butter after that... salsa de habichuelas or salsa de biste' or some other meat sauce.. not butter.. *shrug*
8590 2018-11-24 20:21:38 Because capitalist money greed corporations e.g. fossil fuel sucked Venezuela empty. That is what happened to Venezuela when US oil corporations sucked the wealth of that country. So when it is exhausted and the people move, you ring the fire alarms and build walls
8591 2018-11-24 20:21:33 Oil cleanser then a normal cleanser followed by a toner on a cotton pad! I use to love the makeup eraser.
8592 2018-11-24 20:21:33 The orange buffoon showed up to mics this week and said he’s been lowering the price of oil, HE, and no one in the press conference knew to ask him how is he doing that and how he can just lie to the public like that when it has nothing to do with him.
8593 2018-11-24 20:21:30 I need to attempt oil painting again. 
Gotta branch out sometimes
8594 2018-11-24 20:21:14 parking on the neutral ground came down hard crack da oil pan all drunk didn’t now til the next day wen it start running hot
8595 2018-11-24 20:20:57 How much money do you think the islamist regime of Iran is getting for oil shipped to Syria?  Even before there we sanctions, the IRI economy was a mess. It's far worse now.
8596 2018-11-24 20:20:50 Bak have 5 day break.  Next door to LA.  Oil go LA, Dal, LA. Then flip him back to Bak. Just chance for quick look see.  Better than being alone in Bak for 5 days. That’s all
8597 2018-11-24 20:20:32 Finally got an oil change. Now i just need to get my car washed
8598 2018-11-24 20:20:32 Tyrkey time round 2, I have enough propane and oil this time
8599 2018-11-24 20:20:30 Run/yoga/gym (sometimes all three in one day), making my bed every morning helps when I’m in a rut, journaling at bed time, having cozy lights on not harsh (salt lamp, Christmas lights), oil diffuser, tea, cozy blankets/socks

8601 2018-11-24 20:20:11 Does that mean Saudi's are selling oil at below market price?
8602 2018-11-24 20:20:00 It is inexplicable, how people in general didn’t recognize him for the snake oil salesman he is, is beyond my comprehension, he is so obviously selfish and incapable of empathy. To me, it is the greatest mystery of life.
8603 2018-11-24 20:19:56 When I was between gigs I learned 100 uses for coconut oil so I get it
8604 2018-11-24 20:19:43 So children as young as 4 having active shooter drills, "Grab em by the pussy," and overlooking the brutal murder of an American journalist for an arms deal, hotel sales, and oil didn't do that though? Okay
8605 2018-11-24 20:19:41 Same here, let´s see if this second oil plunge will put some frackers out of business.
8606 2018-11-24 20:19:40 Except oil came from algae and other microscopic animals, not dinosaurs.
8607 2018-11-24 20:19:38 Appreciate it! I just got beard oil the other day when I got a haircut. I’ll try the shampoo as well.
8608 2018-11-24 20:19:29 Are you trying to compare an rebellious act against the oil price with the revolution of 1789 trying to say it was  good don't you?
8609 2018-11-24 20:19:23 Amy! We  sauté diced shallots in butter & olive oil + dry vermouth + cx stock. Reduce by half + fresh lemon capers & fresh dill. Great on scallops fish pork etc 
8610 2018-11-24 20:19:08 You should just ignore comments like that. Great jobs guys.

8613 2018-11-24 20:18:49 It threw me off but I wasn’t too surprised... but like MOTOR OIL that is actually psychotic
8614 2018-11-24 20:18:42 I need some enlightenment, If Canada stopped exporting oil what exactly would happen? #oil #info @FanshaweCollege
8615 2018-11-24 20:18:33 old game, big oil funded outlet - now what could go wrong with hydrogen in a crash ?
8616 2018-11-24 20:18:11 Realities coming as a head on collision with nature and these migrant evacuations are a point of inflection. But I can still see many in this comment thread unwilling to begin to talk to nature. What expectations will you keep & let go? What’s coming first peak oil or extinction?
8617 2018-11-24 20:17:58 @dpradhanbjp 

On 5-10/10/2018

Crude oil price- $85/barrel
Conversion $1=₹73
In INR 85*73=₹6205/barrel

On 24/11/2018

Crude oil price- $60/barrel
Conversion $1=₹71
In INR 60*71=₹4260/barrel

Price reduction (6205-4260)/6205= 31.34%.

Red. in petrol prices is less than 10%.
8618 2018-11-24 20:17:55 Guess I can go get a haircut then get my oil changed after I get off. I’m sure I’ll be somewhere hoeing tonight.

8624 2018-11-24 20:17:26 Only invaders. Better than pouring boiling oil on them and lighting it on fire like our ancestors used to.
8625 2018-11-24 20:17:02 Yes I know thyme oil. But contains thymol. Hence name
8626 2018-11-24 20:17:02 Oh, I don't know. The fact Trudeau refused to appeal the court decision. The fact Bill C-69, put forth by the Liberals puts even further restraints on pipelines and oil producers. His refusal to buy rail cars to help get oil to market which would lead to less of a price discount.
8627 2018-11-24 20:16:59 I need an oil change desperately and nobody has any open slots till December 
8628 2018-11-24 20:16:59 I still maintain there are two different groups.
Christians who believe in many of the traditional "values" but are many times misdirected in their application.
Evangelicals who only care about scamming money from unsuspecting people. A.K.A. modern day snake oil salesmen.
8629 2018-11-24 20:16:24 Paris Campbell is an actual motorcycle. Someone please test him after the game for motor oil.

8631 2018-11-24 20:16:23 Why are you so worried about oil companies and whether their industry survives?  Or is it just a team to root for?  Quite the loser rooting for something that has no direct affect on your life.

8644 2018-11-24 20:14:35 So apparently fentanyl was found in vape pen oil?? Literally, fentanyl is becoming like a cancer, just fucking spreading and pretty soon everything's gonna have fentanyl in it or around it. Just wait until it somehow ends up in cheese powder for mac and cheese or some shit.
8645 2018-11-24 20:14:33 Oh wow @OntarioProud that is lobbying to end our reliance on Saudi oil is so bad! By all means lets keep buying oil from a country that kills LGBT and oppresses women! Maybe one day I will be as woke as you @HighTimes1235
8646 2018-11-24 20:14:29 I've never used beard oil, but if you buy @JakeHurwitz's today he'll hand write you a thank you note. I'd want mine to say "Dearest Master Matt. A goatee on top of your throat-ee makes the girls say ay, papi" and then he comes up with the rest. I can't do all the work.

8652 2018-11-24 20:13:42 Here is the key difference from what the world has seen in the past. This is man made climate change and it is taking place in years, not millions of years. Oil companies want you to believe the opposite so they keep making money and not be held accountable for the destruction.
8653 2018-11-24 20:13:32 I did that and it lasted more than 24 hours. I switched to CBD oil
8654 2018-11-24 20:13:26 Oh please pour burning oil in my ears.. They must be vying for a White House invite. This admin won’t be happy until women are barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen and gay people are back in the closet in fear of their lives
8655 2018-11-24 20:13:25 If you put enough olive oil it counters the carbs right?
8656 2018-11-24 20:13:18 11/27 - "Kaine System" indicates  Reduce "Short" stock positions.  Negatives for stocks are moving averages, wealth, & investor confidence.  BUT stocks are near long-term support and very oversold.  Also Economy is strong.   Oil price decline - Fed may delay interest rates hikes.
8657 2018-11-24 20:13:16 I just had to get three new tires and now I’m waiting on an oil change that thankfully I had a coupon for. My pockets are CRYING
8658 2018-11-24 20:13:12 That's because Trump lowered oil prices for the whole World don'tcha know.

8660 2018-11-24 20:13:09 Alberta oil companies are now asking the government to help to pay for rail crude tanks for 120,000 bpd to get around the pipeline issues. The easier choice is to shut in production, not wait for tankers to show up.
8661 2018-11-24 20:13:08 and in 2000 miles i'll need an oil change

8667 2018-11-24 20:12:43 You’ve got oil and blood in your hands Rain Man
8668 2018-11-24 20:12:31 아..태왕님이랑 계유 나이차이가 천년인데............내가 이 커플을 밀고 있는게 개에바가 아니라고 말해줘
8669 2018-11-24 20:12:26 If the bands hadn't been extorting the oil industry under the guise of environmentalism we wouldn't be in this position.  Instead they hopped on the environmentalism bandwagon to further exploit the industry to what may be their own detriment along with the countries.
8670 2018-11-24 20:12:22 We get 8%of our oil from Saudi Arabia. We export more then that. The U.S. Made themselves reliant on SA
8671 2018-11-24 20:12:19 Don't you mean "The UK" discovered oil?
8672 2018-11-24 20:12:11 I literally drench my self in coconut oil and lay in my bed looking like an oily mess. 
8673 2018-11-24 20:12:07 Your head get oil 
8674 2018-11-24 20:11:49 More solar and wind less meat and oil.
8675 2018-11-24 20:11:43 Gordon Duff put the team together, likely to hide his own guilt for what he had been doing with the oil and arms trading overseas in Iraq which I suspected back then, working against American interests.

8677 2018-11-24 20:11:21 Baby oil and let it set & start pulling them off
8678 2018-11-24 20:11:01 Finally having CFA since spring and I don’t even care that I’m riskin my life with this peanut oil 
8679 2018-11-24 20:10:47 “The replacement cost of the copper, phosphate, oil, and soil—and so on—that we use is not even considered. If it were, it’s likely that the last 10 or 20 years (for the developed world, anyway) has seen no true profit at all, no increase in income, but the reverse”
8680 2018-11-24 20:10:47 And burning the midnight oil! Unless you are in London, poring over the Kew archives, looking for Intelligence reports on Mr. Menon's dealings with Mr. Patel while in His Majesty's service.
8681 2018-11-24 20:10:44 No, I just read everything I can on the subject. I hold some oil stocks and need to follow everything if I'm going to continue to hold them.
8682 2018-11-24 20:10:42 Clair Ridge was just a lucky guess?
Pffft... Oil companies must feel daft now, spending millions in exploration when they could just check our lucky guesses
8683 2018-11-24 20:10:42 Brazilianism Black Oil.
8684 2018-11-24 20:10:42 What else is a lie??? The first one... okay not a big deal. But OIL ON PANCAKES? R U KIDDING
8685 2018-11-24 20:10:38 because the tory government stole all of the oil to finance their purges on the working class and the unions,
8686 2018-11-24 20:10:27 Not my take and I actually live here and work in the oil industry.  The pipeline issue isn’t his fault nor is the price of oil. Alberta is recovering, it always does. Though it’s always refreshing to see fellow Canadians hoping for our demise.
8687 2018-11-24 20:10:26 No one should be providing  this abominable regime with weapons at all! Ever! This is so wrong! The western world needs to stand up to the Saudi monarchy and break free from their oil and financial influence! #yemencantwait #savethechildren #stopthewar
8688 2018-11-24 20:10:23 Thousands freeze in NYC housing as mayor deBlasio sleeps warmly. He sues oil companies while burning up fuel for yoga. Hypocrisy at its best
8689 2018-11-24 20:10:20 They are pine grosbeaks. Put out some black oil sunflower seeds and you will seek lots of them. Crossbills have a similar coloring but are smaller.
8690 2018-11-24 20:10:13 The fantasy that there's better prices to be had by shipping to Europe/Asia is just that: fantasy.

Tar-sands dilbit & oil that reaches tidewater (via current KM) still goes to US. 

Discount to other markets is inherently higher: they have better cheaper, cleaner, closer sources

8693 2018-11-24 20:10:00 If you're out of shaving cream, use olive oil. It works just as good, if not better.

8695 2018-11-24 20:09:51 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
8696 2018-11-24 20:09:50 Where is this magical demand unicorn for WCS oil? Where are the actual refineries that can handle it? If there is pent up demand, wouldn't restricted supply increase price? #ableg #cdnecon
8697 2018-11-24 20:09:49 rub just a LITTLE bit of coconut oil in your hair before you bleach it, and also wait to bleach your hair like a few days or a week after its last wash, these two things should help protect your hair! 
8698 2018-11-24 20:09:43 You sure about that? I don't mean that sarcastically - I mean it honestly. I ask because, most of the articles I've read that argue against Thorium are flawed in their premise.  Some, like the reactors of the past, are paid articles funded by big oil.
8699 2018-11-24 20:09:39 It's not easy by everyone being hostile, but when I look at the way he nailed sanctions, built coalition with Japan and Korea and brought North Korea to the table, or reimposing Iran sanctions that every lobbyist and Asian and European country opposed while keeping oil prices low
8700 2018-11-24 20:09:38 It's not Alberta, he's doing it to Canada.  Extreme spending while literally neutering one of the largest tax bases of the country.  Equalization payments and socialized spending require investment into the country.  That's fleeing by the day and so is the cash flow from oil.
8701 2018-11-24 20:09:29 Best eaten, I found, parked behind the lino factory. With the reek of hot linseed oil wafting in on the breeze for an authentic Lang Toun ambience.
8702 2018-11-24 20:09:26 This castor oil tho 
8703 2018-11-24 20:09:24 I think its about oil and the petro dollar.
8704 2018-11-24 20:09:10 Mix the Shea butter with the coconut oil all winter.
8705 2018-11-24 20:09:06 @eatyourkimchi Martina! I just watched the supermarket haul where you're talking about not wanting to take strong drugs for pain. I swear this stuff is amazing for pain (my mom takes it for cancer pain) called Red Kratom. Take with turmeric, chamomile tea and CBD Oil (if you can)
8706 2018-11-24 20:09:03 Tell Nnamdi Kanu to step himself then dip him in boiling groundnut oil. So you biafra pigs use your head sometimes. So you can also be reasonable right?

8708 2018-11-24 20:08:44 Not any more. Most new cars have recommended 10,000 mile oil changes.
8709 2018-11-24 20:08:43 Who wants to drop my oil n change my tranny fluid n filter
8710 2018-11-24 20:08:38 We're using woodchips because it's industrial waste.  AB has bunker oil, QC has woodchips.
We actually had a sawdust crisis...
We were going to drown in sawdust b4 we drowned in oil, lol! 
There are lots of options. But the more we spend on oil, the more we lose.
#OpportunityCost
8711 2018-11-24 20:08:35 Gov Adefarati inaugurated OSAPADEC. Allocating 40% of Ondo revenue allocation to the rivering areas. The first among the Oil producing states.
8712 2018-11-24 20:08:11 I’m not “left” or “right”. I’m not against oil or Pipelines. I’m against prolific waste of oil & lobbyists directing most investments to oil. I also confused GillPowell4 with GillPowell1-3, my bad & I apologize. Classic mix up. There is no perfect 100% answer to these debates.
8713 2018-11-24 20:08:10 You've been found out as having vested interest since the dirty Palm Oil industry is actually paying you isn't it?
8714 2018-11-24 20:08:03 I ordered CBD oil for anxiety. Hope this shit works over time.

8723 2018-11-24 20:07:03 I bet he got his oil checked a time or 2 on the way up 
8724 2018-11-24 20:07:03 Now the market reversed the oil highs realizing it was all BS

Trump trying to take credit. Smoke & mirrors

Meanwhile SA cutting production
8725 2018-11-24 20:06:54 Abbott ALMOST had to make Texas a separate country to save it from losing MEAT industries and OIL industries from obama, obama tried to shut them down, obama had to be stopped.
Beto sided with obama..
media did not let people know that,
media is only propaganda to help the Left
8726 2018-11-24 20:06:53 If it happens "across every sector" why do you single out "oil and gas"?
And why in seven hells don't you protest BC's coal industry?
8727 2018-11-24 20:06:47 맞아~!!!결혼 할꺼면 링이 성인이 되고 결정 한 뒤에 하라고ㅠ진짜 백번 맞는 말
8728 2018-11-24 20:06:46 Because the current oil price is now down $20 from the average price of $70 in Q3 2018, or 28%, it will lower the cost to produce gold and silver.  That is, if the oil price remains low over the next several quarters, which seems likely
8729 2018-11-24 20:06:44 Malabu Oil scam: UK court repatriates $73m to FG, cash deposited with CBN.
8730 2018-11-24 20:06:41 Quite right, porritt is not the only one purporting to ridicule the current publicity around insidious rainforest destruction for huge greedy palm oil corporates & the countries behind this catastrophe. He lives in leafy Cheltenham so hardly affects him!
8731 2018-11-24 20:06:41 I come home and my mom tried to cover up the fact that she tried to get rid of anything of mine she deemed “ugly” by painting my room and my dad tried to pretend he didn’t break my side mirror by saying he changed the oil
8732 2018-11-24 20:06:38 niggas really out here forgetting to change their oil 
8733 2018-11-24 20:06:36 Never knew you bots liked Imported Mexican beer . I’ve always imagined you guys drinking European imports just because they are dark like oil
8734 2018-11-24 20:06:32 I haven’t seen Shea butter or coconut oil scented products marketed for men.
8735 2018-11-24 20:06:22 @Groupon thanks Groupon. I drove 30 minutes to get an oil change only to find out it’s not active because you bury detail like the Groupon won’t work for 24 hours. What a joke. Thanks for the inconvenience. Groupon sucks.
8736 2018-11-24 20:06:20 naja erstmal argan oil in die haare und ab und zur rewe

8738 2018-11-24 20:06:03 So much for carbon taxes raising prices.  However, low gasoline prices are cause by the oil discount.
8739 2018-11-24 20:05:56 who told castor oil it could smell that bad

8741 2018-11-24 20:05:43 Do we have anyone call Commander-in- Chief? even the look-alike will not say a word because most of the fallen soldiers are of Southern origin. Northern soldiers are sent to oil rich Eastern region to secure their oil wells and bunker y business
8742 2018-11-24 20:05:21 Oil, guns, money.
8743 2018-11-24 20:05:20 Its why trump helped Vlad pump up oil to 82 bucks with the NK and Iran Bs. 

It was ALL ABOUT OIL PRICES for Russia $$$.

Trump set it up.
8744 2018-11-24 20:05:18 But you just said few minutes ago :

“"Tsunami." "Flooding of Biblical proportions." "Onslaught of supply." The American oil industry is about to create OPEC's worst nightmare”.
8745 2018-11-24 20:05:15 I use a facial oil from a small independent brand. How do you like the liquid?
8746 2018-11-24 20:05:14 My car is getting his first oil change and I wanna cry... cars are basically kids, but instead of growing up they just die out on you :/
8747 2018-11-24 20:05:12 $DNR traded $6.61/share, decreased (67%) to $2.18/share

Gain on ops increased by 21% from $163M in '17 to projected $197M in '18

ROE will decrease from 25% in '17 to projected 23% in '18

1) poor performance of US crude oil prices
2) weak BS w/ significant cash flow issues
8748 2018-11-24 20:05:10 Oil market fundamentals played a large role in the declibe.  Everything else excecerbated the declibe.  We have massive increase in OPEC and non-OPEC supply, then a large sudden upward revision for US oil output in August. Then cane Trump exemptions.  Started from here!
8749 2018-11-24 20:05:08 Malabu Oil scam: UK court repatriates $73m to FG, cash deposited with CBN..

In and out of Forte oil, stadium road.
8751 2018-11-24 20:04:53 That black castor oil got me feeling godly 
8752 2018-11-24 20:04:52 I'm more into local solutions than one size fits all.  I can understand AB using oil or wind, but the O&G lobby is trying to develop oil in QC. QC FFS.  We run on hydro, not oil.  There shouldn't be a single ICE in my province! 

Geothermal for Iceland.
Solar Arizona.
Etc.
8753 2018-11-24 20:04:51 Fuck I needa go change the oil and spark plugs on my truck 
8754 2018-11-24 20:04:48 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. It has a stated mandate to support the oil companies and introduce American style conservatism to Canada. This is not news, it is propaganda.
8755 2018-11-24 20:04:46 I don't think a teacher is going to line up to work on an oil rig. 

Our payroll (in terms of what a position makes) is far higher than any other province - even BC - which doesn't exactly suck for GDP, quality of living, or rank low for cost of living.
8756 2018-11-24 20:04:43 And the 3% who don't are funded by big oil companies.
8757 2018-11-24 20:04:19 Can Saudi money and oil buy their way out of pariah status for murdering Jamal Khashoggi? Look to MBS’s reception at the G-20 next week for preliminary answers.
8758 2018-11-24 20:04:13 My formula for success? Rise early, work late, strike oil.
成功の秘訣？ 早起きすること、遅くまで働くこと、油田を掘り当てることさ。
8759 2018-11-24 20:04:09 By buying a pipeline & still subsidizing fossil fuels? How about taking on climate change & green economy in a gamechanging way? Put oil $ in green energy, a fund to help resource workers to transition to green energy work & developing national electric recharging infrastructure.
8760 2018-11-24 20:04:03 We have oil and need oil you nut.
8761 2018-11-24 20:04:03 2 things: where else would we get our oil? and Trump's fetish for authoritarians
8762 2018-11-24 20:04:02 Imagine liking Willie “Snake Oil” Taggart...
8763 2018-11-24 20:04:01 But we wouldn’t have discovered oil without the brilliance of British geologists and scientists, because we’re far too wee and definitely far too stupid to have discovered it by ourselves.
8764 2018-11-24 20:04:00 Mixing rosehip oil with my foundation is the best make up hack ever. Dry winter skin where bitch?!
8765 2018-11-24 20:03:56 NNCP AND CO in partnership with agencies responsible for oil consumption in the country records sufficient distribution and consumption of petrol but it doesn't correlate with the prices deflation
8766 2018-11-24 20:03:44 It's a good deal ...but urself will see the future what Saudi Arabia will do with oil prices later...
8767 2018-11-24 20:03:42 Its more treason than hypocrisy. Putin sitting on a whole bunch of oil under that ice AND Tillerson taught them how to get it out. U.S. fighting w/Canada would make us need Putin. HE WOULD THEN OWN US.
8768 2018-11-24 20:03:39 Reminds me of Subaru, which now refuses to respond to complaints about oil consumption, even though they admitted responsibility in a 2016 class action. Punish the consumer who complains!
8769 2018-11-24 20:03:31 Don't sweat.  Baker on 5 day break.  Oil go LA, Dal, LA.  Bak just up road from LA.  My view is he joins for look see during that, then back to LA, back to Bak. Better than leaving alone in Baker for a week with nothing to do.  Seems to make sense to me?
8770 2018-11-24 20:03:28 Your MCM tells you "Damn that sucks" when you tell him your car needs an oil change..
8771 2018-11-24 20:03:21 The one where ppl started themselves on fire? All for some screwed up turkey in peanut oil?
8772 2018-11-24 20:03:20 Good thing @realDonaldTrump is America First and maintains relationship with SA to keep oil prices stable in US. The key variable in economic models is energy costs. Energy cost changes for the most part are the key to economic forecasts.
8773 2018-11-24 20:03:05 People want it "to be a thing?". 97 percent of scientist say climate change is happening and we are the cause. Look at the research of the skeptics and see who they are funded by. The Heritage Foundation, EXXON, and other oil related interest companies. They have an agenda.
8774 2018-11-24 20:03:04 Still buying foreign oil???!
8775 2018-11-24 20:02:50 Pls help us at shaba ward Kaduna North we also need a transformer the electricity supply is been rationed pls hlp
8776 2018-11-24 20:02:46 I guess the exports need to go to zero to stop oil from falling more.
8777 2018-11-24 20:02:44 I read an article, Dirty Khomaini in 1979 stated that every month, he was going to share the oil money with every village town and city, making everyone a millionaire!!
8778 2018-11-24 20:02:43 Diffuse some peppermint oil.

8784 2018-11-24 20:01:56 Good grief folks. Tactical call up.  Baker going on 5 day break. Just up road from LA.  Oil do LA, Dal, LA.  JP joins for brief check on 4th line.  Then back to LA & back to Bak.  Better than sitting alone in Baker for a week twiddling thumbs.
8785 2018-11-24 20:01:47 r u the ceo of an oil , Lumber or steel company ? did someone from the inside tell you the numbers ? did you read it on the internet ?
8786 2018-11-24 20:01:44 She'll have to escape to America before they wheel the Guillotine out and oil it for all the Royals, and the house of Lords will have to do a runner too. The French don't like the aristocracy.
8787 2018-11-24 20:01:43 @herbivorebeauty Hey..  your products... folllow you on here and subscribe to email but still missed the news about the launch of Emerald oil and body polish... would be nice if you guys tweet about new products!
8788 2018-11-24 20:01:36 Except this is not completely true because you continue to use palm oil in your products and are responsible for the destruction of orangutan habitats, as well as the near extinction of orangutan habitats. That’s pretty much “animal cruelty”. Shame on PETA for awarding you!
8789 2018-11-24 20:01:27 Gawadar port is more beneficial military wise. Economy is an add on. Oil route of india can be blocked entirely from gawadar. It is life line of india.

8791 2018-11-24 20:01:06 Obviously @EmmanuelMacron's policies and taxation are not the best solution for #French Economy. Rising oil prices and affecting considerably the purchasing power of French citizen demonstrates that he is completely detached from reality.

8793 2018-11-24 20:00:55 I put baby oil on my eye and keep rubbing it with a warm towel they’ll fall off in the towel.
8794 2018-11-24 20:00:46 Is that right? Porritt is paid by the industry? Says it all if so with his insidious stance on the matter. Its weird how some of those who appear to support rain forest & flora/fauna charities have Corporate partners who are doing the destruction of rain forests for Palm Oil!
8795 2018-11-24 20:00:44 Yeah, a wet bird and hot oil is not a fun combination.
8796 2018-11-24 20:00:36 yeah, we had a nice parm coated with truffle oil and honey. i took the rest home-- so good!

8803 2018-11-24 19:59:50 Olive oil contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids, which are largely resistant to heat. #diet #nutrition
8804 2018-11-24 19:59:45 My husband bought some “old style English” sausages, looking at the label they had canola oil in them.

8809 2018-11-24 19:58:36 It’s gorgeous. Needs good olive oil, though.
8810 2018-11-24 19:58:34 Apparently you went following the oil rigs who might call it a day and cancel the winter drilling season. This will affect thousands. Lovely eh?
8811 2018-11-24 19:58:12 Oil change on the Daily and on the Z done #ProductiveDay

8813 2018-11-24 19:57:57 Michigan took advantage of a year MSU, Wiscy and PSU weren't that great, and still can't can't find Lucas Oil Stadium!
8814 2018-11-24 19:57:51 Just a FYI - oil gas prices aren't sent by Trump or have any of his actions lowered prices. In fact 40% of the oil to the US comes from Canada which the lowest in the world at under 20 USD. Which was guaranteed under NAFTA but gone in USMCA - kinda means the opposite. #FYI
8815 2018-11-24 19:57:49 I just did the same thing, leftover peanut oil for the turkey comes in handy
8816 2018-11-24 19:57:34 Told my dad I was about to get an oil change and get gas, he precedes to take my keys from me and told me “I’ll take care of it.” A MAN

8819 2018-11-24 19:57:28 Right I've made it tonight with arrow root powder the coconut oil I had to melt as it just made a crumbly mix and was dry. It's now setting in the fridge.

8823 2018-11-24 19:56:59 My heart goes out to you sister  breast will come soon, soup sop and olive oil and it will grow
8824 2018-11-24 19:56:22 They treated me with oil of clove infused packing. It worked. Treatment for three consecutive days where I went back for fresh packing.
8825 2018-11-24 19:56:10 I also just noticed that after today Condors are off for 5 days.  A couple Oil game in that stretch.  Bring him along for ride and look see rather than leaving him wondering what the F to do to keep self occupied in Bakersfield alone for that long.
8826 2018-11-24 19:55:40 infuse some garlic into olive oil, that’s better for ur nails
8827 2018-11-24 19:55:33 You that didn't buy generator; the 5 virgins didn't take extra oil too 
8828 2018-11-24 19:55:29 First period post-breakup is a TIME. NPR story about traveling dog? TEARS. Background music from a movie I'm not even watching? TEARS. Memory of Brian May playing with projections of Freddie singing? TEARS. Can't find vegetable oil in S&S? TEARS.
8829 2018-11-24 19:55:27 Oil is the awesome sauce and the lifeblood of civilisation. Even though it only generates 4% of electricity it is at 46% the largest energy source. Natural gas is 21% global energy and likely to displace the most coal generation reducing pollution.
8830 2018-11-24 19:55:16 The best (and cheapest) way to remove makeup TO ME is rubbing olive oil over your face with your fingertips then wiping it off with a warm towel. It gets off everything including water proof makeup. Just make sure to wash your face after with your normal cleanser & moisturizer.
8831 2018-11-24 19:55:16 Oil ever 3 k

8832 2018-11-24 19:55:14 Does anyone one else sees their life flashes before their eyes when you put the fries in oil
8833 2018-11-24 19:55:12 Well said Alison, Porritt & those with a vested interest such as Corporate De-foresters, Supermarkets, product makers using this insidious 50% fatty oil through foods, soaps, candles, shampoos in fact all sorts. Wonder what porritt's agenda is????

8835 2018-11-24 19:55:05 The head of Russian oil company Rosneft, Igor  Sechin, flew to Caracas this week to meet Venezuelan President Nicolas  Maduro and complain over delayed oil shipments designed to repay loans,  two sources briefed on the conversation said on Saturday.
8836 2018-11-24 19:54:55 Thats the word one the street, do you work in the oil industry?
8837 2018-11-24 19:54:55 He was an exceptional draughtsman. I bought this at the same time as the 'found' oil but this was listed as 'by Spencer'
8838 2018-11-24 19:54:49 No business emails in my inbox. Watch, just as soon as I go get the tools for my Chevelle and get my hands covered in oil, everything is going to pop off.
8839 2018-11-24 19:54:47 "Green growth leaders" is a euphemism for "need to phase out the oil sands". Trudeau is a twit.
8840 2018-11-24 19:54:46 Dear Michael, just a note to let you know that it is abundantly clear that Theresa May and her toadies are obviously liars.The whole world knows this. The London Labour gang lied about the reserves of oil, this is a one party state.Orwellian indeed! Doubleplus ungood.
8841 2018-11-24 19:54:46 What control over oil does holyrood or Scottish government have? I'm not aware of any planning regs that they could use to make life difficult for oil companies?
8842 2018-11-24 19:54:45 Our oil just dey shine for your body
8843 2018-11-24 19:54:41 Anointing oil , extra virgin olive oil.. ask the Lord to bless it as anointing oil! Anoint yourself! Pray for protection and health as the Lord knows our hearts! End with PRAISE! Yeshua Jesus our Lord Righteous and Mighty is He over ALL the Earth and Heaven! We pray! Amen! 
8844 2018-11-24 19:54:28 Funny, my Republican father is complaining that his oil stocks are taking a dive and he'll have even less money to pay for my mom's nursing home. I guess that your president is responsible for him losing thousands of dollars it took him a lifetime to build up.
8845 2018-11-24 19:54:23 2014. Chuanhai Cao of the University of South Florida:
“These sets of data strongly suggest that THC could be a potential therapeutic treatment
option for Alzheimer's disease through multiple functions and pathways.” Snake oil you say?
8846 2018-11-24 19:54:11 Sea Cumber that has been seared in olive oil.
8847 2018-11-24 19:53:58 Replace it with CBD oil
8848 2018-11-24 19:53:56 Please post video or audio recording of her actually saying she was against oil and against pipelines. Being in the picture doesn’t prove shit. Why do you insist on controlling her? Are you Obsessed?
8849 2018-11-24 19:53:54 The president said he caused oil prices to drop. Fin.
8850 2018-11-24 19:53:43 Being Tosh can cause beards. 

Trim, Style, Apply Oil.
8851 2018-11-24 19:53:35 Hemp can be used to make anything now made from oil. Eliminating the environmentally friendly renewable resource hemp, has hurt us in ways people have yet to realize. Hemp was the silent casualty in their war on drugs. They couldn't outlaw hemp so they outlawed cannabis instead.
8852 2018-11-24 19:53:27 Making royalties on cbd oil, crypto, music and at least 40 other things for now (lots more coming up) is real fun and exciting
8853 2018-11-24 19:53:23 with the motor oil dude lmao
8854 2018-11-24 19:53:17 Most importantly, We're planning to come up with a program immediately after this election, in order to prove to the world that Nigerian Youth can survive without oil money. Our entrepreneurial drive will shock the world when we come together to build a great blacknation on earth

8856 2018-11-24 19:53:13 It pains me to even know the context in which the oil was used.  Can't my mind just be clean for once.
8857 2018-11-24 19:53:02 The map is missing the Pipelines they planed to build from Leviathan gas field,, and stolen Syrian/Lebanese Gas & Oil etc,  that they want to build to Arabia refineries, here we see the pipelines to Europe to sell the stolen Gas and Oil to Europe etc, fucking thieves..
8858 2018-11-24 19:52:57 When I was little I accidentally poured a bunch of glitter on my face and my sister used coconut oil to get it all off.
8859 2018-11-24 19:52:55 bio oil makes my face glow different. I know it’s only downhill from here.
8860 2018-11-24 19:52:54 Who cares? Can you folks eat oil? No party needs the West to form a government, least of all Alberta.
8861 2018-11-24 19:52:47 Friend, what do you know, that Exxon doesn't. They are voting against you with their money. All the oil companies are. What is the secret? Why not publish it?
8862 2018-11-24 19:52:42 2019 Resolution: learn how to change my own oil and my lights.
8863 2018-11-24 19:52:42 If we look at it it's clear that the oil industries are the ones trying to line their pocket books at the cost to everyone else. 

It's also clear that we need a jobs program in the US because companies aren't increasing the size of the labor force even as they make more money.
8864 2018-11-24 19:52:41 Engine oil change hony wala hai
8865 2018-11-24 19:52:24 More Lurpak than the mind can comfortably comprehend, hot milk, plus - when I'm feeling flash - either leeks sweated in a little olive oil and/or roasted garlic that's been pureed.
8866 2018-11-24 19:52:13 It's disproportionate (and what is the source of your "fact"?). "The United States, with less than 5 % of the global population, uses about a quarter of the world’s fossil fuel resources—burning up nearly 25 % of the coal, 26 % of the oil, and 27 % of the world’s natural gas."
8867 2018-11-24 19:52:08 One VERY important way to save endangered species is by NOT buying anything with palm oil, and the various names it goes under.  Forests are ravaged to make way for palm oil farms and beautiful animals like orangutans are on the verge of extinction because of it. Be aware please!
8868 2018-11-24 19:52:04 Oh, it’s the CIA that can’t be trusted...in fact, there is no country more dishonest in the world than Saudia Arabia...at least we know where Iran, Syria, Russia, China, etc stand. SA is more like North Korea...only worse...they have oil.

8874 2018-11-24 19:51:21 《オリーブ油豆知識》
オリーブ油は オレイン酸が腸の刺激を促してくれるため、便秘解消効果がある
8875 2018-11-24 19:51:19 Going green would create tons of jobs. The reason it is not popular among politicians is because a new green industry would directly compete with oil, the banking industry who has heavily invested in oil pipelines, defense contractors for our oil wars, Saudi Arabia and others.
8876 2018-11-24 19:51:08 Richard Nison accomplished the largest deception when he declared war on cannabis. He used madness and a czar to do it. Had we invested in hemp instead of oil, our landfills and oceans would not be as polluted with plastic. Plastic made of hemp is 100% biodegradable. They knew!
8877 2018-11-24 19:51:05 I’m not saying we’re dependent. But a long way from not needing oil and gas.
8878 2018-11-24 19:51:00 After drying off, use a lotion or oil to hydrate your legs. Moisturizing them will help prevent the little red bumps that can sometimes crop up after shaving.
8879 2018-11-24 19:50:57 Really? I guess the bankers who lost their lives to the Offa robbery were told lies before they got recruited into that branch of the bank too.
Let's be objective, lives can be lost anywhere; Aviation, Telecoms, Oil & gas...just anywhere!
Life happens, a truth we mustn't twist.
8880 2018-11-24 19:50:53 Truth,if not for the dependence on oil.........
8881 2018-11-24 19:50:51 Democrats will NEVER act so long as they accept money from big oil, and everyone knows it. Meanwhile, we are running out of time to do something.
8882 2018-11-24 19:50:49 Proper Argan oil smells so rank
8883 2018-11-24 19:50:42 Dude. Brush whatever you got and use beard oil. Helps it shine and grow better and you'll stop messing it with it because you won't want the oil on your hands and ruin the brushing. That's what helped me most! Also, use Mane and Tail shampoo daily.

8885 2018-11-24 19:50:22 Snake oil?
8886 2018-11-24 19:50:20 Oil, brakes?
8887 2018-11-24 19:50:08 All reviews of the foundation I’ve watched got the best results when using the Wake and Bake oil, so I’d recommend using that first to make a fair decision on how you feel about the Cake Mix foundation!
8888 2018-11-24 19:50:07 It has already started it takes time the stock market already shows it. Now bringing in cheap oil from Saudi will cause  oil comp to lose profits right after he lowered thier taxes less taxes weaken this already failing gov.  made is expensive due to taxes a regulations 
8889 2018-11-24 19:50:05 And the pipeline advocates are being paid by US companies. Ask the oil companies how much government subsidies they get. It’s way more than any other non-petroleum company in the energy sector.
8890 2018-11-24 19:50:04 It appears to me that both sides are in it for money. Coal + Oil industries on one and money hungry individuals on another
8891 2018-11-24 19:50:00 I’ve been craving some Maggianos bread with oil and parm for the longest! I’m about to take a walk over and eat alone
8892 2018-11-24 19:49:56 The same reason snake oil salesmen don’t use their own elixirs.
8893 2018-11-24 19:49:51 Just let the Saudi royal family murder a French citizen on tape at their embassy in an allied country and let them get away with it. Suddenly the price of oil will absolutely plummet.
8894 2018-11-24 19:49:35 to put some of this marula oil in my hot oil treatment for the day or to stop being so extra  hmmm
8895 2018-11-24 19:49:32 Also contributed to the global food crisis of 2007-8 by increasing the price of vegetable oil.
8896 2018-11-24 19:49:29 Still sounds like snake oil tbh
8897 2018-11-24 19:49:28 This has been brewing for long enough, has many fathers. With oil in for a long downward spiral, timing is unfortunate. Carbon tax hits the poor & the strivers hardest.
8898 2018-11-24 19:49:25 I’ll take a little oil with that OLAVE!!! 
8899 2018-11-24 19:49:22 I think ol Zach Gentry put some olive oil on his hands before the game

8906 2018-11-24 19:48:18 So my car started leaking oil yesterday I fixed it today in the pouring rain I’m over the weekend
8907 2018-11-24 19:48:18 Shout out to me for getting an oil change when I was supposed to and not 5,000 miles over
8908 2018-11-24 19:47:59 I'm just trying to point out to this guy that oil and renewables are competing industries. 

They compete for subsidies, markets and infrastructure. 

Oil companies have spent millions on against climate change laws, funding and politicians that support renewables.
8909 2018-11-24 19:47:47 more in Yemen and therefore in a strategic point of the Near East and the great Africa especially the oil route.  West and Saudi Arabia soar on feet will be defeated   remember it
8910 2018-11-24 19:47:38 Oil?  I thought you were talking about the midterm results.
8911 2018-11-24 19:47:27 " Then there was the oil patches, I lost count of how many times I slipped."
8912 2018-11-24 19:47:22 Oil changed, car vacuumed and detailed, lit.
8913 2018-11-24 19:47:19 Taste the rainbow

8915 2018-11-24 19:47:10 times when u guys got away with oil dependency as an argument are SO over. had been for a decade.
8916 2018-11-24 19:46:58 Soaked in oil?!
8917 2018-11-24 19:46:54 you bitches are SO insecure and it’s sad. y’all swear somebody is always trying to get at ya man, I’m just tryna bill him for this oil change sis pls get out of my face w this mess
8918 2018-11-24 19:46:51 Well visitors of Burgan Pod (my boaty) I’ve just learnt that Rayburn’s make exceptional grilled cheez (or cheese if you’re a regular) so come on down. Sourdough, hemp oil, Colman’s & your cheez/cheese of choice.
8919 2018-11-24 19:46:35 The price of oil closed at $50.47 yesterday. A remarkable fall of over 30% since October 2nd. Diesel in the UK is still over £1.30 at pumps-scandalous!
8920 2018-11-24 19:46:32 Praying that He will bind up your broken heart.
And renew your spirit within you.

"In Jesus Name, I annoint you with the oil of gladness".
8921 2018-11-24 19:46:31 Will she be touting salvation or snake oil?
8922 2018-11-24 19:46:19 Back when oil was at multi-year highs, Russia was making a killing from US sanctions.
8923 2018-11-24 19:46:17 Subsidizing the oil industry has cost more.
8924 2018-11-24 19:46:16 It’s great that you’re  willing 2 fight agains racism, however, how about you work towards Medicare For All!? Ins companies are becoming like oil, coal & gas;fossils! It’s time for a change! We’re an antiquated country! We’ve lost our luster the world is no looking up to the USA.
8925 2018-11-24 19:46:10 I have a hunch big oil is all for this, not only because it means they don't have to leave it in the ground, but because it would impair the efficiency of solar power. Win-win!
8926 2018-11-24 19:45:57 There are reports it is expected to go down by Rs 7. In our case though, the fall in oil prices have mostly been offset by the devaluation of the currency internationally.
8927 2018-11-24 19:45:57 I’m glad @redh0tm00n_ sent me some cash. I can finally get my oil changed.
8928 2018-11-24 19:45:50 The...the mineral oil.  Am I on a reality tv show?
8929 2018-11-24 19:45:49 @theCOOKkitchen please don’t use palm oil in your ingredients. You make lovely food and just I’ve just bought a massive batch but I’ve spotted palm oil in some of the things. 
8930 2018-11-24 19:45:46 i was in excrutiating pain, percs and cbd oil weren't even working. i didn't start the exercise yesterday like i was supposed to (bc the er trip) and the pain was just my body being like BITCH, START BENDING YOUR KNEE. i love bodies they're so cool
8931 2018-11-24 19:45:43 Slev: "I'm just going to leave the oil slick so you can light it on fire."
@renleve : "That seems very smart."
8932 2018-11-24 19:45:43 @aprildouglass_ @hevelyngreene can you use regular unrefined coconut oil in our hair or do you have to buy the one in the hair aisle
8933 2018-11-24 19:45:42 Let me answer your question, yes he would, he'd say come you had activities that put your life in danger as for example sharing the horrible notion that KSA has been a  feudal kleptocracy for too long & maybe their people should have a say in how oil money is spent
8934 2018-11-24 19:45:38 Syria can't buy enough oil to make a difference. Sanctions will work and combined with population uprising that won't be ignored like Obama in '09 there is real chance of regime change once and for all.
8935 2018-11-24 19:45:31 just gotta rent a FL house with a mini grotto or at least a nice pool, cop some baby oil, get a DSLR, learn some twerk moves and BAM. Cyber tricks breaking bread. Need a manager?
8936 2018-11-24 19:45:28 the oil found was west of shetland, not north sea
8937 2018-11-24 19:45:24 Stir with a bottle of oil.
8938 2018-11-24 19:45:18 Cut them up and use them as oil blotters for the face #lifehack 
8939 2018-11-24 19:45:08 I hate getting an oil change. This shit always takes forever! And I’m hungry!!
8940 2018-11-24 19:45:01 If you like a lot of mustard oil on your lavash, join our club!
8941 2018-11-24 19:44:54 The Saudi’s are the 2nd largest oil importer to the US. Plus, we have strategic military, economic & intelligence partnerships with them. Don’t let your hatred of anything Trump blind you to important sources of our country’s strength and success.

8944 2018-11-24 19:44:37 oil at 58 dollars now :P
8945 2018-11-24 19:44:28 Omg I know the feeling all too well!! Ordered a Nando's on Deliveroo as a birthday treat and they didn't give me the chilli oil with the houmous 
8946 2018-11-24 19:44:28 tfw your first time out of the house after being laid up with bronchitis is on a cold rainy afternoon and the damn dayspa has an essential oil diffuser going in the restroom 
8947 2018-11-24 19:44:10 You are so pathetic was the US a net exporter of oil in the 90s? Was natural gas prices about 5 times higher? The fact that you compare economic numbers from the 90s in Alberta to now is laughable. Klein was easily the worst premier in our history. Squandered unprecedented wealth
8948 2018-11-24 19:44:07 Electricity is clearly best for transport, pollution from vehicles kills so many never mind the environmental cost. Most likely Scotland would use its oil reserves for fuel but we would be late to the game and we should have a strategy that doesn't rely on it at all.
8949 2018-11-24 19:44:06 I suspect an oil tanker would turn around faster than him.
8950 2018-11-24 19:43:53 I fail to understand the significance of Fishing at all it represents a tiny % of our economy. If quotas were changed it is unlikely we shall all start eating more fish.  Fisherman in Scot got very handsome payments for leaving the Ind and many secured better paid jobs in Oil.

8956 2018-11-24 19:43:18 A good swing has launch quickness. A bad swing does not. Must have LQ to be game usable. BP would show same results as tee. Game pitching would show the bad swing won’t work in a game. Bad swing won’t square up enough balls. Tech companies are selling snake oil.
8957 2018-11-24 19:43:09 I can see your name in the list of the 48 to-be-nominated female MPs...tihihihi.
8958 2018-11-24 19:43:05 Oil market fundamentals played a large role in the declibe.  Everything else excecerbated the declibe.  We have massive increase in OPEC and non-OPEC supply, then a large sudden upward revision for US oil output in August. Then cane Trump exemptions.  Started from here!
8959 2018-11-24 19:42:52 Come on now, you know why this happened, the GOP is at war w/ science, it undermines their power of the faith leader, but why did they originally pick a fight w/ Climate Change? Big Oil & the idea that Climate Change is an excuse to redistribute wealth, this thing is complex
8960 2018-11-24 19:42:42 I do have some oil in the cabinet but it's a very, very rare use of them. Great for dry hands and feet and for keeping baby's skin soft and healthy though. I prefer to get my fat from olives, avocado, and nuts instead. Makes for an easier clean up of cooking pans also.
8961 2018-11-24 19:42:40 Can't minimize the influence of Warren Buffett on this matter. The railways he owns currently transports that oil at yuuuge profit. The pipeline would represent a big savings in transport costs and a big hit to the bottom line for Buffett.

Follow the money. Always.
8962 2018-11-24 19:42:37 i’m getting an oil change and that whore costed $60 my pockets are in need of medical attention
8963 2018-11-24 19:42:33 Thanks! It’s amazing how well #vintagesewing machines stand the test of time. Just a bit of oil and a lot of elbow grease and it was running smoothly again. Thanks so much for donating it to the @OldPrintWorks
8964 2018-11-24 19:42:29 “I’m the ocean you’re an oIL SLICK” has become a personal favorite

Me :good thanks
RG :U looking good..getting new car  Me :uh nah just getting the oil changed 
RG :u said ur husband is getting a car?
Me : nope I didn’t say that
RG : oh thought u were trying to blow me off 
Me : I’m but I don’t need to have a guy to 
8967 2018-11-24 19:42:16 Cbd oil only , quit the smoke couple drop of cbd 10:1 thc let's see if this helps pain on joints, help sleep. Lucky I know a person who gave it free. Btw Gov herb is to expensive and street people are shady. And growing indoors cost to much money. Smoking not good for us.
8968 2018-11-24 19:42:00 There is a huge appetite for oil worldwide. China India being two examples. They control OPEC. Also, do u want them to loosen their grip on Iran and let them go nuclear? Or let Russia build military bases there? We don’t have to be at their mercy-just be practical in responsding
8969 2018-11-24 19:42:00 @jamescharles sister hack: use baby oil on a cotton pad to remove more pigmented eyeshadows, after you wash with your normal face wash. Still leaving your skin moisturized!
8970 2018-11-24 19:41:59 If you think anyone is going to pay top dollar for a far lower grade oil you are haplessly misinformed. Global oil prices don't care for your "ethical oil" nonsense. Read a book please.
8971 2018-11-24 19:41:54 Checkin the oil
8972 2018-11-24 19:41:50 #FastTrack oil change on West Mason in Green Bay is anything but fast! Shouldn’t take an hour for a damn oil change! #theyallstandingaround
8973 2018-11-24 19:41:49 But is it possible the Oil are pulling a "Sharks" by taking advantage of proximity to Baker by pulling him in for a one game look see for Hitch, then sending him back?  LA is very convenient for that.
8974 2018-11-24 19:41:41 Hahahaha - the Oil barrel still has the black stuff in it
8975 2018-11-24 19:41:37 Even electric cars need lubricants & mineral oil still best.
8976 2018-11-24 19:41:35 Okay but we already give these oil companies billions in subsidies why not move those over to green energy?
8977 2018-11-24 19:41:30 Went to get my oil changed and it turned into a whole list of things including a recall. 
8978 2018-11-24 19:41:27 The motor oil tho 
8979 2018-11-24 19:41:27 Turkey wants to kill its golden goose (oil $).
8980 2018-11-24 19:41:25 Will anything stop the oil price collapse ??
8981 2018-11-24 19:41:04 My thinking is this: Pls help correct me if I'm wrong. A free float means volatility & uncertainty. And since it's FPIs and oil money(after under recovery) making up the reserves, FPIs stop flowing in with uncertainty so we don't reach the $60bn reserves.
8982 2018-11-24 19:40:53 We also have to be weary of Neoliberal Democrats who might give good lip service to the cause but really are with the Oil Barons. Obama answered Shell's phone calls in the Arctic twice and Hillary sold fracking around the world. We need REAL People who care to step up, not POLS.
8983 2018-11-24 19:40:50 Come on now, that's that motor oil flavored syrup, I heard its delish
8984 2018-11-24 19:40:49 Lol!!!
8985 2018-11-24 19:40:42 Oil for fuel is what was mentioned not the other uses, even Saudi Arabia is attempting the move from oil, look at the volatility in the Russian economy, oil isn't economically stable, the strategy has to be diverse or we will be at the whim of the market.
8986 2018-11-24 19:40:40 Nope he just realizes how stupid you are, what part of oil glut do you not understand. Besides the part where many people don’t think pipelines belong in earthquake zones and an oil spill on the coast would be a disaster. Climate change is real.

8993 2018-11-24 19:40:13 How does this help anyone except to vent some rage? It has no message, nothing except some childish jab at Trudeau. Don't think PMJT does enough to help Western Canada? Don't think there's enough done to move oil? (Neither do I). Say so.
8994 2018-11-24 19:40:08 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
8995 2018-11-24 19:40:03 Canada  has 3rd largest oil reserves in the world and we politely answer questions from journalists. We’ll always be there for our good neighbours 
8996 2018-11-24 19:40:03 For one, putting all the barrels in storage while not cutting production will send Trump a message. We're ok with producing oil but we're not ok with getting ripped off by the Liar In Chief.
8997 2018-11-24 19:40:01 You do realize that we still need oil to make industrial goods and plastics until we can get bioplastics viable. No reason to burn oil for heat and moving things anymore - save it for better purposes.
8998 2018-11-24 19:40:00 They love themselves and oil more

9000 2018-11-24 19:39:48 The truth is that the Iranian people have lived under sanctions before and have diversified their economy more than other nations in the region as a result. Unsure is they will tolerate it again, but they aren't completely dependent on oil.
9001 2018-11-24 19:39:44 It’s difficult to believe I actually want sensible gifts now that I’m grown.  Like ah yes my room will smell so nice with an oil diffuser!
9002 2018-11-24 19:39:36 Saudi certainly have done ok but that’s very soon going to be a thing of the past. Mats don’t have the sense to see that oil economies are rapidly, rapidly moving away from it.

9007 2018-11-24 19:39:08 Rubbish, its not stupid you are advocating greed for profit! There is no such thing as 'sustainable palm oil. 'The term sustainable is an all embracing escape clause, a misnomer & pure logical fallacy', check it out!
9008 2018-11-24 19:39:07 그런거라면 이해해~!
9009 2018-11-24 19:38:58 I agree with that article with a Cavet. BH is a special purpose vehicle used for various objectives. Currently might be oil
9010 2018-11-24 19:38:56 Please. They said the same of us in Iraq-did we leave with the oil? No. Our military doesn’t steal resources, it’s trained to kill the enemy. Your argument has no basis in reality.
9011 2018-11-24 19:38:53 Mistake!  I didn't convert barrels of oil to tonnes of CO2.

Boe = 432 kg CO2, or .43 tonnes.  

So nuclear plants we would need 32-33.
Wind turbines we would need 32,000-33,000.
9012 2018-11-24 19:38:44 Ur mcm uses bio oil on his face with the best thing i've ever written tho.

9016 2018-11-24 19:38:33 I believe it's in the Saudi's/Russian best interest to totally punch back and send Brent to $85 immediately. All they have to do it put all their oil in storage, Brent will rise then offer unlimited barrels at $85 until the storage is back to normal.

9020 2018-11-24 19:38:03 The economies of the Balkan countries would bloom with cheap and available natty gas. The current use of heavy oil and wood for heating/cooking is both expensive and an environmental disaster. There are a lot of spillover benefits.
9021 2018-11-24 19:38:03 I've squared off with Diane and while she does present facts, she'll stretch them to suit her partisan purpose.
One such claim is thanks to shale oil the USA doesn't need our oil anymore. This is totally false. The USA still imports over 7 million barrels of crude each day.
9022 2018-11-24 19:38:00 My Arami oil is here. I can wait for it's wonders. Missed it much
9023 2018-11-24 19:37:57 Yes, cat. You are quite right.

Tonight's culinary delight consists of smoked haddock pieces, slow braised in a bath of milk with olive oil and a knob of butter, finished off with pasta and peas.

Unfortunately, all of this haddock belongs to ME!!!
9024 2018-11-24 19:37:51 Um, no. Most countries in the world are moving away from gas fed cars. By 2020 in Norway for example no gasoline cars will be available. And they’re an oil and gas country. Canada needs a renewable resource based economy.
9025 2018-11-24 19:37:50 *ready the oil covered bats* got to get that poetic justice 
9026 2018-11-24 19:37:44 It was gas prices being down because of his disregard for human life. Even though we get only 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia.
9027 2018-11-24 19:37:41 And we're busy fussing about how the low price for oil will impact Texas state income- while our CO2 emissions falls from the fracking caused natural gas glut.
9028 2018-11-24 19:37:40 I’ve noticed all my oilfield friends who backed POTUS are all of sudden quiet in their zeal for him with his wanting to keep oil prices low. Oilfield will start layoffs if the price doesn’t go up. Personally that’s a tough one, cheaper oil helps my wallet but....
9029 2018-11-24 19:37:38 How am I lying dear?

#Scotland has plenty other cleaner resources to build a fair economy on. Calling those concerned about their planet hippies won’t bode well. You should apologise #ScotRef
9033 2018-11-24 19:37:09 Chip fat M, we can do without the oil, but we must have chip fat, anyway, you sassenachs are using all our oil.

9039 2018-11-24 19:36:20 The head of Russian oil company Rosneft, Igor Sechin, flew to Caracas this week to meet Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and complain over delayed oil shipments designed to repay loans, two sources briefed on the conversation said on Saturday.
9040 2018-11-24 19:36:20 So many olive oil chocolate cake
So little time
9041 2018-11-24 19:36:18 Hi Nigel. Since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018.
9042 2018-11-24 19:36:10 True, though if you think about it oil comes from plants and animals so in a way it is fitting. If it was under your system would it be a life element or under tree?
9043 2018-11-24 19:36:08 Don't lie.
9044 2018-11-24 19:36:04 Get yourself a quality cast iron. Tons of butter, some oil and fresh herbs. Sear and baste post boil.
9045 2018-11-24 19:35:57 How sad that, in a supposedly free market world, the oil industry has somehow convinced/tricked us into thinking we should save them when it's their responsibility to adapt, change and compete on their own merit.

9049 2018-11-24 19:35:36 Just saw someone driving a Tesla with an “oil and gas” themed plate and I’m...confused.
9050 2018-11-24 19:35:34 kind of already did give you my thoughts..it’s what U responded to & how convo started. My thoughts are now that dems have a full monopoly on power (as usual) they will burn through surplus trying to FORCE technology that isnt ready to replace oil/gas & hurt our poorest citizens.

9054 2018-11-24 19:35:15 What essential oil do I use for being a gullible dumbass?
9055 2018-11-24 19:35:15 They need us to buy their oil a LOT more than we need to buy it. Without us buying their oil, their economy collapses.  Without buying their oil, we buy it elsewhere, and it's somewhat more expensive. Why do you pretend we're at their mercy when it's the other way around?
9056 2018-11-24 19:35:14 But excuse me your golf cart runs on electricity. Might be a great idea to manufacture more electric.vehicles and tell the Arabians to keep their damn oil and to stop bombing buildings like the Twin Towers. Also tell them that you can’t build any hotels, condominiums or golf
9057 2018-11-24 19:35:11 Or as we do, stop using products with this oil or their derivatives labelled. Easy to do so, as we do & many others will be advised.
9058 2018-11-24 19:35:05 Saudi's were dumb, but not for the reason you suggest. Talk is cheap and the Saudi talk didn't hurt prices one bit. Pulling oil out of their storage and handing it to Trump was their mistake. Trusting Trump would cut Iran out of the picture was their mistake.
9059 2018-11-24 19:35:05 The head of Russian oil company Rosneft, Igor Sechin, flew to Caracas this week to meet Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and complain over delayed oil shipments designed to repay loans, two sources briefed on the conversation said on Saturday.

9062 2018-11-24 19:34:41 His oil policy is ridiculous, siding with Saudi Arabia that has a horrible human rights record, for the sake of oil and weapons sales. "Nvm the fact that they killed a WP journalist, got a think about the money." Although, if he bothered to learn, they only supply 11% of our oil.
9063 2018-11-24 19:34:29 Said I wasn’t leaving the house lol just waiting on them to finish my oil change
9064 2018-11-24 19:34:28 Making a mental note now, to not believe our coaches snake oil salesman bullshit leading up to next year
9065 2018-11-24 19:34:22 When you stop killing whales for oil !!!!
9066 2018-11-24 19:34:20 It’s one hour until kickoff and I am already using my Comfort essential oil lotion because at least I’m going to set myself up to win to watch this game.
9067 2018-11-24 19:34:15 In Divinity Original Sin, Oil is actually one of the terrain effects lumped under earth, haha
9068 2018-11-24 19:34:07 ขี้หวงเอาเรื่องเหมือนกันนะกูเนี่ยมีสิทธิ์มั้ยก็ไม่555
9069 2018-11-24 19:34:06 There’s a hole where mine used to be. Pretty sure it was bartered to the Saudis for some price manipulated oil and untold fortunes in military contracts. If you see it in a pawn shop, please note it was stolen. #iwantmysoulback
9070 2018-11-24 19:33:57 I would contend that you et al were fed propaganda by big oil dressed up as environmentalism(could have been legit concerns about deforestation as well, we weren't sustainably logging), but I have a much better understanding of the genesis of this thread now. Thank you.
9071 2018-11-24 19:33:53 The worst part of coming home for break is having to use the guest 7-1 shampoo/conditioner/body wash/wiper fluid/almond milk/cooking oil/bear repellent because you took all your good stuff with you
9072 2018-11-24 19:33:53 I am looking forward to the oil thumping the Kings tomorrow night I know the kings are lousy this year but they're still the Kings
9073 2018-11-24 19:33:25 I already have a $10 bottle of baby oil ready.
9074 2018-11-24 19:33:13 I’m all for keeping oil and gas as well as mining out of the bighorn / eastern slopes, but ultimately this is going to restrict access
9075 2018-11-24 19:32:49 Cooking Oil:

Buhari = Ororo

9076 2018-11-24 19:32:48 #ExtinctionRebellion
Leave the oil & gas in the ground.
9077 2018-11-24 19:32:48 He put oil on himself
9078 2018-11-24 19:32:48 The co2 climate science is simple and obvious. Sequestering carbon (buried oil, living trees, healthy oceans, etc) keeps it out of the atmosphere. Burn the stuff and it produces heat and immediately goes into the air to produce the greenhouse effect.
9079 2018-11-24 19:32:45 Ladies:  Is it effeminate for a man to smell like Shea butter and coconut oil?
9080 2018-11-24 19:32:43 Oh really like Shell, Total, BP (even big oil now admit man made climate change is real) and every fucking scientific institutions on earth.
9081 2018-11-24 19:32:41 I can't forget the explosives and kerosene gasoline crude oil black tar cement
9082 2018-11-24 19:32:18 Amwage hiyo oil ya budake, ateleze mpaka naija..Si yeh Ali perform 30 min last time?
9083 2018-11-24 19:32:05 Red cabbage, radishes, and feferoni peppers are the greatest things to exist. Especially put together w some salt, vinegar, and oil. 
9084 2018-11-24 19:32:01 It is not so much Trump but these sumb Saudis who talked oil down to help Trump with the midterms and created a full scale crash.
9085 2018-11-24 19:31:48 Yeah 27% which means that use coal and oil for the other 73% and correct me if I'm wrong but their cars still run on gasoline
9086 2018-11-24 19:31:46 motor oil.. MOTOR OIL???
9087 2018-11-24 19:31:45 Mommy issues? Says obama who's mother was - how shall I say this......loose? easy? available? absent? obama was a huge disappointment, a liar, corrupt and a snake oil salesman bent on destroying America.
9088 2018-11-24 19:31:27 It’s scary how fast it goes from a gang of cute lil kernels hanging out in some oil to OH GOD THEYRE EVERYWHERE
9089 2018-11-24 19:31:23 Sheeeesh my boy had alll the time in the world coulda gave his car an oil change back there
9090 2018-11-24 19:31:21 having some breakfast. took my car in for an oil change and maintenance then have my dad's memorial service this afternoon
9091 2018-11-24 19:31:17 Whenever I hear something funny I say hahaha
9092 2018-11-24 19:31:16 Divest from oil and encourage wind solar etc.
9093 2018-11-24 19:31:16 No matter what happens in the short term in oil...Oil is done. The #Hydrogen Economy is coming and ultimately we will be using synthetic petroleum at dirt cheap prices.
9094 2018-11-24 19:31:09 Gallons of baby oil.
9095 2018-11-24 19:30:57 I might just be naive but what's the point of adding lot of veg oil to stew?
Person go pour like 10 litres and the sea of oil will just be on top
9096 2018-11-24 19:30:51 But toddler in Chief is hooked up with coal and oil
9097 2018-11-24 19:30:50 I mean do boycott all the palm oil, coffee, tropical fruit, etc. produce on top of all the other democratic means you have to your disposal.
9098 2018-11-24 19:30:46 Shadman is like oil. The world hates him but also needs him
9099 2018-11-24 19:30:40 How many have capability to refine bitumen into a product that would replace Saudi oil?
9100 2018-11-24 19:30:39 If you watched my shows on just ONE day this week you’d have seen: markets, oil, Yemen, climate, wildfires, newly Congress, Bill Browder, Interpol, Mississippi, Black Friday, Lettuce, Kashoggi, Facebook/privacy, child labor. You think ONE segment on Clinton crowded anything out?
9101 2018-11-24 19:30:34 Conspiracy theory: nations WANT the ice caps to melt because then they’ll be able to use those areas to pump oil
9102 2018-11-24 19:30:31 Yes a scam to make the world cleaner and rip of billionaires those are the sneakiest scams     thank god your profound intelligence has seen the truth burn more oil NOW!
9103 2018-11-24 19:30:23 That sounds like it would be a cool element, I mean imagine all the possibilities. I think if I had oil magic I would just make people trip at the worst time lol. But seriously oil does sound like it could be a cool element
9104 2018-11-24 19:30:21 You might want to give that a time scale... palm oil is increasing and has happened over a tiny time period, the livestock will be over hundreds of years, also as someone else pointed out where on the chart is the rest of the deforestation due to all other veg grown? It’s biased
9105 2018-11-24 19:30:20 We have Americans living in tents in the rain in California. 
Central American country shoppers are living in comfy detention centers.
9106 2018-11-24 19:30:20 Good idea- there’s just a bunch of sheep there. No oil.
9107 2018-11-24 19:30:15 Mas, Genaro, antes de cair no ostracismo que lhe é de direito, apresente a proposta da Black Star Oil, ok? Afinal, vc sempre pensou no bem do Palmeiras, não é mesmo?!?!?
9108 2018-11-24 19:30:07 That's funny. Canada supplies 40% of oil imported to the USA.  KSA? 11%. (Wonder what we would get away with, eh?)  Also, the hundreds of thousands of jobs Trump is babbling about is at most a couple of thousand jobs. An agreement to buy arms in the future, is not $ in the bank.
9109 2018-11-24 19:29:59 What did he get wrong in the article? The discount is the result of a price war being conducted by oil companies vying for space in the pipe network, as well as shutdowns at heavy oil refineries down south.
9110 2018-11-24 19:29:52 castor oil
9111 2018-11-24 19:29:50 Choose sustainable palm oil rather than boycotting. Much better all round.
9112 2018-11-24 19:29:48 I can't think of a greater mark of disrespect than politicians who try to scare us into voting for them. How incredibly rude and dishonest. Do they think we are stupid or something? Morrison et al can take their snake oil and stick it. We aren't buying what they're selling.
9113 2018-11-24 19:29:45 It's neither news networks or journalism practised by these snake oil merchants.
To expect real news from them is nativity & idiotic. Indian #MSM is a group or mafia, they're in for money. News & informing masses isn't their priority. 
Agents & lobbyists masked as journos,get it?
9114 2018-11-24 19:29:43 Brilliant thanks but bloody hell how many are palm oil - what did they use before?
9115 2018-11-24 19:29:29 The head of Russian oil company Rosneft, Igor Sechin, flew to Caracas this week to meet Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and complain over delayed oil shipments designed to repay loans, two sources briefed on the conversation said on Saturday.
9116 2018-11-24 19:29:28 I'm an American and want to see Canada #DrillBabyDrill. Canada is blessed with enormous natural resources which translates into wealth and prosperity for her people. Oil jobs are well-paying for a day's hard work. #MCGA #TrudeauMustGo #WalkAway
9117 2018-11-24 19:29:26 If an Ansel Adams gallery has ever made you stop in your tracks, I would really urge you to go visit any Albert Bierstadt exhibit you can find. To my most layman understanding, his oil paintings are shining examples of excellent art.

9119 2018-11-24 19:29:20 How did Trump cut oil prices?
9120 2018-11-24 19:28:45 Pretty sure he also believes olive oil doubles as moisturizer and hair product.
9121 2018-11-24 19:28:43 No.  #Republicans & #Democrats must come together on what is truly important. #ClimateChange. Address the elephant burning down the room. Stop oil production and consumption ASAP and invest in renewables.  You, @realDonaldTrump, are driving the world deep into peril.
9122 2018-11-24 19:28:39 Can't find it because there were a ton of side threads, but others saw it, he was saying something like the US provoked Japan into war because it stopped selling it oil, which it was clearly obligated to do if it wanted "peace."
9123 2018-11-24 19:28:31 man wtf it’s ardy been 3 months since my last oil change, nah
9124 2018-11-24 19:28:25 Did you use motor oil instead of syrup?
9125 2018-11-24 19:28:25 The head of Russian oil company Rosneft, Igor Sechin, flew to Caracas this week to meet Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and complain over delayed oil shipments designed to repay loans, two sources briefed on the conversation said on Saturday.
9126 2018-11-24 19:28:24 Can you use any type of oil based moisturizer/primer to use the cake mix foundation?

9128 2018-11-24 19:28:09 Had anyone ever considered Oil as an element? The ancients have access to cooking oil, fats as well as deposits of tar and bitumen...
9129 2018-11-24 19:28:04 @GOP Don't Republicans have anything better to do than hash and rehash the Clinton email story?? MOVE ON. Maybe you should subpoena Ivanka Trump. Stop with your smoke and mirrors and quick change scams. Your snake oil is showing.
9130 2018-11-24 19:27:55 I’ve followed you for a short while. Have any interest in oil/gas? Perhaps the US natural gas market for example.
9131 2018-11-24 19:27:53 My wife: We need some olive oil

My brain:
Don't say it
Don't say it
Don't say it
Don't say it
Don't say it
Don't say it
Don't say it

Me: (In my best Shelley Duvall voice) Oh, Popeye!
9132 2018-11-24 19:27:42 getting an oil change and theyre showing the georgia v gt game in the waiting room. i was about to brag about how i went to Tech and actually show school spirit but i took one glance at the score and quietly sat down
9133 2018-11-24 19:27:21 Poppies. A world at war over who controls Poppies. Big Oil is a mask, we could have been off of oil 50 years ago. Opium is the Phantom of the Opera.
9134 2018-11-24 19:27:18 Your mcm goes to jiffy lube to get an oil change.
9135 2018-11-24 19:27:04 if we keep up i am happy because in my eyes they cheated with illigal oil king laundry money and do not count!!!
9136 2018-11-24 19:27:01 Oooh I like the look of that bath oil #Penhaligons
9137 2018-11-24 19:27:01 Trudeau's subversion of Canadian oil & gas industry is a DOMESTIC  problem. And lets talk about it. By all means.
9138 2018-11-24 19:26:31 Downloaded Gemuruh on iTunes cos I need to burn the midnight oil....for another 3 weeks atleast. Teringat zaman muda kat utp pasang lagu sama on loop untuk bakar semangat  kudos for a great song @faizal_tahir !
9139 2018-11-24 19:26:25 Good lord. Do you know anything about the NEP? Do you know the Supreme Court ruled that parts of the NEP were unconstitutional? It was a blatant attempt to steal oil from the west and sell it to eastern Canada at a huge discount. You call that Energy East? Hahahahaha. Idiot!
9140 2018-11-24 19:26:23 10 man oil change, the bukake of auto service
9141 2018-11-24 19:26:22 Obviously As a car owner it's necessary you change oil
9142 2018-11-24 19:26:05 We can run down the fuel usage, but oil can be used for so much more than that.
9143 2018-11-24 19:26:05 Your sense of entitlement is frightening. You just expect that all the money from oil belongs to other Canadian governments.
9144 2018-11-24 19:26:03 It’s not. It’s ‘bait & switch.’ They scare dummies into believing they’ll all “die” if they don’t elect the “right” people, and the only ones hucking that climate change snake oil are socialists, using environmental laws to gain more control over people. While getting rich.
9145 2018-11-24 19:25:55 Have ya' seen Paris, France today? Aye yi yi. The world is awakening to the fact that we do not need oil like we have.  Those that are going to be negatively affected financially will start world war because of it. They are crazy. 
HEMP WIND SOLAR & Reduce Reuse Recycle
9146 2018-11-24 19:25:54 Oil prices going down was not from Trump support of Saudi’s.  The OPEC leaders had agreed to slowly decrease oil supply by slowing the pumps. Nobody stuck to it! So they arranged to meet fir another agreement, but nobody showed up.  So Russia & Saudi’s have jacked up drilling. 
9147 2018-11-24 19:25:44 Scotland wants immigration devolved , judge for yourself why that was ignored , same with taxation. Read the McCrone report , wasnt about the oil , but the capital inflight.

The initial challenges are minor , ask any state thats went indy in the last 30 years.
9148 2018-11-24 19:25:40 Using all the woman olive oil on my skin 
9149 2018-11-24 19:25:24 it's a problem not exclusive to palm oil but also includes fuel oils derived from corn and other commodity crops as well. Using the US as an example, so much of the prime farmland is not being used to grow food but fuel and other bioproducts instead
9150 2018-11-24 19:25:16 Currency Union, oil revenues, Currency, save the NHS from English privatisation, Salmond claims re wealth, Scotland would prosper (see Sturgeon’s SGC Report)   continuing EU membership.  

7 key ‘yes’ lies right off the top of my head.
9151 2018-11-24 19:25:00 Need an oil change before I get on the road.
9152 2018-11-24 19:24:59 "Alberta Energy’s 2007 royalty review warned the province about the perils of increasing production without increasing value-added production" According to this article the raw truth is ABs failure to build refinery capacity to add value to low quality tarsands oil. #cdnpoli
9153 2018-11-24 19:24:59 #OPEC 

Baby @realDonaldTrump & Prince @jaredkushner importing 40% of U.S. oil from Canada, only 11% from #MBS. 

They will use $450 billions for #Iran, not for America. Look at Puerto Rico.

@VP @JustinTrudeau @RandPaul @SenSanders @jeremycorbyn @mehdirhasan @Ocasio2018 @JZarif
9154 2018-11-24 19:24:58 Told everyone one here about the the Claire ridge a year n a half ago, and they’re still underestimating the amount of oil that’s there. It’s an enormous amount of resources trapped there
9155 2018-11-24 19:24:54 Germany would fortify the coastlines of Europe. Europe would be immune to any kind of invasions and an invasion of the Middle East and North Africa would require much less divisions than in the Soviet Union if they so needed it for Oil.
9156 2018-11-24 19:24:52 What's bizarre is tolerating the deceit in the typical politician's rhetoric. Is it really so awful that Trump would explicitly tie cheap oil to further cooperation & arms deals w/ the Saudis (that Obama initiated)? Try admiring substance over style sometime.
9157 2018-11-24 19:24:35 today I brought my car into the shop for an oil change & also added in a point ab how my car pulls the the right when I’m driving & now I’m sitting here an hour and a half later wondering why I ever said that bc now I need new tires AND I’m wasting my day away
9158 2018-11-24 19:24:20 With fries. As long as they’re cooked in vegetable oil.
9159 2018-11-24 19:24:06 Its uh noodles in sichuan pepper, hot oil, pork, and bok choy
9160 2018-11-24 19:24:01 Simple & clear is your absurd conspiracy theory & anti #Trump bias. @POTUS & Saudi rise in oil production bad for #Russia. Obama & NY Times helped #Iran against #USA, #Israel, #Saudi, #Jordan, #Egypt @realDonaldTrump fixing it.Real #Russian collusion-Clinton.
9161 2018-11-24 19:23:54 I would normally support SBS except that I would need to drive, and gas prices are still more than 50% higher than when Obama was in office, while oil prices plunged with no positive effect for consumers.

Plus I didn't get my promised tax cut.

Handing out coupons for hugs...
9162 2018-11-24 19:23:47 Ck เหลือเท่าไหร่อ่ะครับ
9163 2018-11-24 19:23:46 We do have control of our CO2 emissions. For instance - we can choose to spend our tax dollars on endless wars in middle East to secure our oil rich allies like Saudi Arabia to burn carbon cheaply, or spend a fraction of that money subsidizing EVs and renewable resources.
9164 2018-11-24 19:23:40 The same congress that authorized the murder of hundreds of thousands of children in Iraq for oil? Those same people your going to listen to on how to act?
9165 2018-11-24 19:23:39 Trump is afraid of Nothing. IT'S FAKE NEWS. Report is Bogus; written by Climate Change Alarmist Partisans. Only thing true in the report is that the minute warming of Planet will have definite beneficial effects. Increased vegetation, improved crops, less use Oil/Gas use 2 heat
9166 2018-11-24 19:23:35 Oil prices will go up.l promise. You should wait a little bit.
9167 2018-11-24 19:23:35 Random Fact: since the human age there has never been a straight 100 years without a war 

& most wars are oddly based on Religion & natural resources (stuff that man can’t make like gold, land, & oil)
9168 2018-11-24 19:23:23 #MSNBC More proof that .@AlexWitt doesn’t do any homework. This administration and the GOP Congress has been kicking the teeth of alternate energy production for years, at the bequest of the Koch bros I might add! The only fiscal budget the GOP cares about is the oil industry!
9169 2018-11-24 19:23:01 There is no fundamental reason for WTI to be $50. So I see the floor constantly. It comes down to traders pulling the trigger to buy and cover both. If Trump just kept his mouth shut, oil prices would bottom immediately. Oil falls each time he tweets/speaks about oil.
9170 2018-11-24 19:22:57 Using your logic we should stop giving breaks to oil and Gas companies too.
9171 2018-11-24 19:22:50 Country shopping.

9175 2018-11-24 19:22:47 if you have peppermint oil put it on your temples across your forehead and back of your neck. that’s what always helps me.
9176 2018-11-24 19:22:39 I'll say that other docs outside of the ones he talked to brought up the mineral oil stuff as well.  But yeah, you can continue to think he orchestrated it like some conspiracy.  If you don't believe it's a big deal, like I do, then you should have no problem just moving on
9177 2018-11-24 19:22:32 You are correct! I have thought for years that the free world needs to put extraordinary work into figuring out a way to be 100% oil independent of the Middle East. #ClimateChangeIsReal #RenewableEnergy
9178 2018-11-24 19:22:31 Sorry to hear it. Hope it wasn't too crazy. 
I worked at a health food store for 4 years. Holiday shopping kind of missed us. After all, who wants to get a bottle of fish oil capsules for Christmas...?
9179 2018-11-24 19:22:18 Hahaha!! So you can start and use a chainsaw!?! You know where the bar oil goes and what has mix to use? You know which way to use your file so you dont fuck up your chain? Do you know where to light it up if you flood it?? Nice! Like I said before-> Go for it!!
9180 2018-11-24 19:22:08 I need more coconut oil. I can’t make cocoa butter without it.
9181 2018-11-24 19:22:00 80% of US oil comes from Canada.  Vacuous.
9182 2018-11-24 19:21:53 Frying the pancakes in oil gives them crispy edges 
9183 2018-11-24 19:21:48 The greedy Albertans who have shared oil wealth with the rest of Canada to the tune of 220 billion. Is that how you describe greed
9184 2018-11-24 19:21:43 Your country didn't hold Saudi accountable for the attack...WTF? Third president to cozy up to them despite them being the largest supporter to terror outside of the USA. Oil is to important for even Canada to do the right thing.
9185 2018-11-24 19:21:42 Glycerin inside Pears Baby Oil? Check well oh. Infact na because of sweat sef I dey prefer Oil to Lotion. Vaseline is a lot of work for me sha. I needs strong rubbing to get all over the body and a nigga is too weak for that 
9186 2018-11-24 19:21:38 so today i had some oil i put on bread now we wait

9191 2018-11-24 19:21:28 I am late to the climate change issue in doing anything about it, today I go sustainable palm oil only
9192 2018-11-24 19:21:23 Many non-Albertans do care. I'm outraged by the dismal failures of the federal government and their lack of support for the oil and gas industry, which is integral to the Canadian economy. Build the pipelines.
9193 2018-11-24 19:21:23 Let me get this straight, one of the most oil rich nation (Saudi Arabia) has energy issues and needs plans for a nuclear power plant and Trump is on board with this? 

Trump you are Saudi Arabia’s Bitch..........

9195 2018-11-24 19:21:17 Just looked at the ingredients in my flapjack @Morrisons; Palm oil - so not cool #PalmOil #orangutans
9196 2018-11-24 19:21:17 Ok, maybe you’re debt ridden and underpaid because you suck? Great argument.  My business is strong but my local population shrinking since people are leaving the area, due to the states regulations on oil and gas pushing business out of state to Ohio/WV/NY amongst other issues.
9197 2018-11-24 19:20:46 Why would you expect them to do anything about it? #Trudeau said years ago that he wanted to phase out the oil sands, and if you watch his French interviews, he has absolutely no love for #alberta
This is exactly what he wanted.
#cdnpoli
9198 2018-11-24 19:20:36 I would agree with you if it included all oil and gas subsidies as well.
9199 2018-11-24 19:20:33 I have to go to sleep, so if anyone wants to have a look at the man who is responsible for the crappy algebraic equations used by the climate snake oil pushers, and general bastardry then just google JAMES HANSON & GISS...
9200 2018-11-24 19:20:21 All these reasons are exactly why the Saudis need to cut production back to 2016 and fill their tanks completely full. Selling their oil dirt cheap doesn't help them. They are better off cramming it in their storage tanks and floating storage too.
9201 2018-11-24 19:20:16 Depends if you run on coal for power or not; or natural gas. Oil price rarely affects power and heating unless you heat with oil. Which few places do.
9202 2018-11-24 19:20:12 Check me if I'm wrong here Jess. The NIH, NASA, NOAA, NSF. Government agencies. Also, some big oil companies research climate change to better position themselves for the future. (Exxon was sued for stifling this info for decades.)
9203 2018-11-24 19:20:08 this is not true. The WSJ is fake news. Has nothing to do with the journalist that was killed. It has to do with there is no evidence to say the Prince killed the guy. We now make enough oil for our country to where we can leave opec if we wanted to
9204 2018-11-24 19:19:52 Same figure was paid to settle oil company loans? 
9205 2018-11-24 19:19:42 Dont worry about it faith keep up the good work i know the people of Toronto are smart and next time they will show up in thousands just like the people did in alberta for oil and we cant let this happen dont let up
9206 2018-11-24 19:19:41 It was until Trump ruined it. Funny how he is obsessed with oil prices so won’t dare speak out against the Saudis, but Boeing, an American company, has also lost a good bit due to Trump’s actions with Iran.
9207 2018-11-24 19:19:38 I dunno, is the oil hot?
9208 2018-11-24 19:19:35 Aspen CO and Burlington VT are pretty sizable cities. The challenge isn't the capacity for energy (Germany, Netherlands, etc. prove that), it's the bested interests of coal, oil and gas.
9209 2018-11-24 19:19:31 In France, more than 50 millions people pay taxes (VAT, local taxes, oil taxes ...). Far fewer are protesting. Because the rest understand taxes pay for public services (universal health coverage, schools, retirement, roads ...) (1/2)
9210 2018-11-24 19:19:21 Trudeau Sr. wrecked the oil & gas industry in the 80s when he tried to nationalize it. But if NEP had continued, the political will would have existed to build pipes. Of course, PET was horribly wrong. But Justin's sabotage of the industry is arguably more damaging than his dad's
9211 2018-11-24 19:19:00 Hear that teachers? Cons think that you don't work. Remember that at the polling booth. Remember too that Harper's only pre-politics job was as a mail clerk at the oil company where his Daddy worked.

9213 2018-11-24 19:18:54 I AM SO EXCITED! Thank you so much AskMen and @barretwertz we are absolutely thrilled and honored that you love our retinol oil! #jordansamuelskin
9214 2018-11-24 19:18:29 Pack if lying hypocrites! Entire UN is a money laundering criminal enterprise! HRC controlled by murderous arabs & you sit there bloated with oil money!
9215 2018-11-24 19:18:27 Elijah just finished the oil change on moms truck. Check ig
9216 2018-11-24 19:18:24 Oil is cheap,he says!
9217 2018-11-24 19:18:13 The UAE  used crude oil to invest into tourism and trade . Today Dubai is not just a shopping destination but the busiest tourist hub across the world  fetching them billions . That model is workable in Africa . We can’t rely on export of raw materials for the next century .
9218 2018-11-24 19:18:12 Good plan. I also think I’m the only vegetarian there. I should pull out some disturbing videos of factory farm life & palm oil destruction while they’re eating Lol
9219 2018-11-24 19:18:01 blended cashew nuts mixed w oil on top of ur baked sweet potato.
9220 2018-11-24 19:17:52 Hi lovely! Absolute best thing you can do for oily skin is to ditch foaming cleansers. They actually encourage oil production by stripping the skin of its natural oils. May I ask where you live and what your budget is? I'll be able to make a recommendation based on that info 
9221 2018-11-24 19:17:44 U are mischief monger  in disguise of  gerua apparel .  U added more  to , too much courtesy too much craft "   oil UR own machine.

9223 2018-11-24 19:17:22 Oh, and I'm sure this never happened when oil went to $100 per barrel?
9224 2018-11-24 19:17:11 When I die throw my phone in the casket with me, between group messages and DM’s I need some oil on my forehead 
9225 2018-11-24 19:16:53 Vote in Premier Notley a pipeline protestor and when your Prime Minister has vowed to phase out AB Oil! Albertans should not be surprised when ALL pipelines have been cancelled or delayed indefinitely!  We need ZERO NDP in May and Separate from Canada! #albertaseparation
9226 2018-11-24 19:16:51 if I can give some tips, youre skin is just like mine sebelum ni. breakout teruk sebab taktahu ingredients. tapi apa yg saya boleh cakap, jangan skip cleanser, toner, moisturizer and sunscreen. ni kena kukuhkan dulu baru boleh selitkan yg cleansing oil ape semua.
9227 2018-11-24 19:16:38 The lights come on my car saying you need an oil change, they've just had it a week to do that!!
9228 2018-11-24 19:16:35 Get the Holy oil out and reconsecrate the land in Jesus name after destroying it! Bind the demons up b4 tearing it down in Jesus name!

But the stress in making that oil ehn
9230 2018-11-24 19:16:21 It's filled with oil!
@barstoolsports
9231 2018-11-24 19:16:19 Price of gas is lower due to oil prices: “I AM THE GAS MASTER WHO MAKES UR GAS CHEAP!!!”—politician
Also, price of gas is higher due to oil prices: “THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO EXCEPT BLAME LIBRULS”—politician

9234 2018-11-24 19:16:10 cooking oil will get rid of it
9235 2018-11-24 19:16:06 So I was watching this Ultimate Guide to Chinese Streetfoods, and I was wondering if a worker in that said noodle house sneezes while scooping a good amount of sesame chili oil  WELL...HAHAHA What are the odds 
9236 2018-11-24 19:16:04 Is it simply ignorance that Trump encourages prices<$50? Or is the pain for  domestic oil drillers a relatively small price to pay in exchange for cheap oil, which benefit a wide array of industries?
9237 2018-11-24 19:15:31 Finally got an oil change ! 
9238 2018-11-24 19:15:24 Need to oil my hair
9239 2018-11-24 19:15:11 ini dilakuin 3 hari sekali. kalo orang2 banyak yg sehari sekali but ain't nobody got time for that 

ini 100% coconut oil. dinamakan hot oil karena ada sensasi panas nya pas dipakai ke kulit kepala. tapi gak sampe yg PANAS bgt gt kok cuma hangat aja. 

JGN SAMPE KENA MATA
PERIH
9240 2018-11-24 19:15:10 I was even reading how electric cars will eliminate a lot of blue collar jobs because of simpler engines, less frequent oil/brake pad changes. Good news overall but those jobs emplo a lot of skilled people.
9241 2018-11-24 19:15:08 My Brother, Now Is Campaign Period. It Is A Throwback Giant Strides Of Senator @ShehuSani.
9242 2018-11-24 19:14:56 That's the narrative. But the truth is that the French have already steadily reduced their consumption of Nuclear, Coal and Oil. The government is trying to keep their income untouched. The #French will have none of that.
9243 2018-11-24 19:14:50 My reputation as a mechanic was tarnished Wednesday when I changed my oil but drained my transmission fluid, not the oil.... so
9244 2018-11-24 19:14:43 Cheap gas is a sign of a weak economy. Also, Canada is losing $80 million dollars a day on the cut we're taking on Alberta oil. Alberta oil is a drag.
9245 2018-11-24 19:14:40 hahahahaha kashmir oil use krty
9246 2018-11-24 19:14:34 Coconut oil will be rubbed in daily :)
9247 2018-11-24 19:14:26 starting to think putting coconut oil in my hair is not gonna solve all my life problems. really want my money back
9248 2018-11-24 19:14:25 I remember when they started with their trickle down, how is younglings questioned. But in the end, we bought into it...
Now I'm old, and the consequences are happening fast.

But I sure as heck know how to live without oil. I've got 10 cords stacked, dad's bucksaw sharpened...
9249 2018-11-24 19:14:10 Saudi Arabia is the problem of this poor country! The Huthy rebel’s & government of Saudi Arabia. The world deliberately looks away because they need the oil of the saudis. A big shame. Yemenites & rohingya are the forgotten people of this world. Don’t know where humanity is?!?
9250 2018-11-24 19:14:10 Why is oil relevant.. ah its about saving the world ? Got it.
9251 2018-11-24 19:14:09 Go for it!!! Blood is more precious than oil. Like you don't NEED to sell oil?
9252 2018-11-24 19:14:08 I think about that a lot

9254 2018-11-24 19:13:50 I don't see people freaking out about oil crashing $USO. Weird. I have seen posts of people going long.  Oil fell over 7% Friday, the biggest 1 day % move of this ~34% crash since Oct 3rd. If stocks fell 34% people would be panicked. The calm is disconcerting. It will ripple IMHO
9255 2018-11-24 19:13:50 Without oil la
9256 2018-11-24 19:13:44 You know ... I just don't care about Alberta oil.  I really don't.  I hope they do lose the pipeline.  It pains me a great deal that Trudeau is so invested in it.  Why?  That's not why he was elected.  Alberta oil is bad for the environment and now the economy.
9257 2018-11-24 19:13:41 Why is everyone so frustrated when it comes to oil?
9258 2018-11-24 19:13:38 Trump has many red lines. But oil immediately removes those lines.
Oil in, honor out.
9259 2018-11-24 19:13:22 As great as this is, here’s the reality:

- This is Chelsea’s 1st loss. they’re now in 4th. Insane. 
- Liverpool & Tottenham are enjoying their best ever starts in the PL era, yet they’re short the top of the table.
- Man City is miles better & ruining the PL w/ all their oil $.
9260 2018-11-24 19:13:19 The photo shows why we must demand deforestation-free Certified Sustainable Palm Oil.
9261 2018-11-24 19:13:18 Is still crude oil the world main economic factor of necessity?
9262 2018-11-24 19:13:09 I’m still eating the fuck out those cardboard motor oil pancakes tbh
9263 2018-11-24 19:12:59 Obama vetoed Keystone because Harper, the guy you supported as leader, said it was a "no brainer." Like him, your insults, negative comments and lack of cooperation with FNs and the rest of the country will get you nowhere. BTW, Alberta oil is already subsidized by the feds.
9264 2018-11-24 19:12:58 Obama jacked up regulations on oil safety and literally as soon he deregulate safety. Remember BP in movie Deep Horizon won numerous awards that they couldn't get enough even exact same time Deep Horizon blew up. Now Trump with lettuce. He deregulate water safety. #ClimateChange
9265 2018-11-24 19:12:46 @Nestle fancy sorting your shit out. Literally destroyed a rainforest for parm oil for a fucking shit product of yours is unbelievable. Dickheads

9270 2018-11-24 19:12:09 So you think the people in the oil & gas business should be put out of business? How will you fix the infrastructure without products & materials developed through the oil industry? Give me your explanation please?
9271 2018-11-24 19:12:07 Slowing economic growth thanks to Trump Trade wars leads to less oil consumption and therefore lower oil prices. Thanks Donald for the slow growth.

9273 2018-11-24 19:11:54 How many times a week do you think about future Lisa Simpson with the stupid fucking hair?
9274 2018-11-24 19:11:44 We barely get any oil from the Saudis. We get more from Canada. Additionally, our gas prices are the highest they have been since 2013.  He is just a pathological liar
9275 2018-11-24 19:11:28 The east loves their dictator oil. And they love Saudi Arabia and the other dictatorships they buy oil from. Anyone who supported PET and the NEP can go right back to Russia. The west should separate from Canada. We do not need anything confederation can offer us.
9276 2018-11-24 19:11:23 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
9277 2018-11-24 19:11:13 Yes.. I have noticed same pattern. Though this time international crude oil rate is also reducing and India started to buy fuel from Iran where India is saving transport cost and paying in Rupees instead of USD
9278 2018-11-24 19:11:08 10,000 years ago, half of North America was covered by glaciers.  How much oil consumption caused that loss of ice?
9279 2018-11-24 19:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: raw crust with stale coconut oil and chicken.
9280 2018-11-24 19:11:07 Because the French have already lowered their consumption steadily for 10 years, but the government is trying to keep their income equal, even though people are already using less energy across all sources: nuclear, coal and oil.
9281 2018-11-24 19:11:02 I'm old enough to remember what it was like before oil was everything.  It was only 30-40 years ago.  We had trains, buses, public services. We ate strawberries in the summer, not January. Not everyone owned a car. Suburbs were an American thing.
Then Reagan Thatcher Mulroney...
9282 2018-11-24 19:10:48 FACT- the body needs certain good "fats" daily such as olive oil, flaxseed, sunflower and canola. A couple teaspoons is okay.
9283 2018-11-24 19:10:43 @RaymondSuttner your article on xenophobia is utter nonsense! It is cheap propanda which belongs to the rubbish bin! Openly biased, no analysis & lacks integrity. It ranks with snake oil cures.
9284 2018-11-24 19:10:43 Ordered one this morning. The company...Low Class Oil Trash.. is so busy there's a 10 day wait
9285 2018-11-24 19:10:36 Either would work & you shouldn't need to soak them first. Look for nut or sun butter recipes. Many add a little oil.
9286 2018-11-24 19:10:31 Iam hugely baffled that people are so stupid!The oil prices are set world markets,THEIR IS A GLUT more oil produced than what is currently being used,how is that so hard to figure out?

9290 2018-11-24 19:10:08 In Ottawa again today attending boring private meetings. But trying to figure out how to deal with the oil price crisis is going to be a hard and long process.

9294 2018-11-24 19:09:56 Let’s get this 
1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
9295 2018-11-24 19:09:53 I use a home made, lemon, brown sugar, honey and olive oil scrub that seems to work wonders.
9296 2018-11-24 19:09:49 My car told me I need an oil change and that’s honestly so rude.

9298 2018-11-24 19:09:19 They need to move their economic reliance past oil and Vodka or risk becoming the next Venezuela. He’ll Mexico Taiwan SK are in way better shape than them. 

SA hit the superfecta+ in their ground; gold, diamonds, sweet oil, and nat gas. MBS should be evaluated for replacement.
9299 2018-11-24 19:09:18 It’s fitting that Jiffy Lube sponsors the Rivalry Series because me and oil changes have quite the long-standing rivalry.
9300 2018-11-24 19:09:17 I went to get an oil change and the man took one look at my tires and looked violently ill

9304 2018-11-24 19:08:52 Are there conflicting thoughts in the WFPB community about higher fat WFPB diets (say with more coconut oil or EVOO) compared to the typical very low fat WFPBD... or is there strong consensus there?
9305 2018-11-24 19:08:51 This is why NO COUNTRY, including China & Russia, should sell Saudi Arabia weapons and should consider Saudi Arabia a hostile, terroristic country. Get prepared for an oil embargo and a threat of war. Don’t forget: ALL the terrorists of 9/11 we’re Saudis, including Bin Laden.
9306 2018-11-24 19:08:49 Given that at the crrent price, and that the oil companies make no money at that level, we could sell more  at a loss......!!!!
9307 2018-11-24 19:08:43 #ClimateChange. The report states that this IS happening because of humans and their lack of intelligence. That nothing else could possibly be causing it. We need to get every jughead science denier and big oil stooge out of public service ASAP.
9308 2018-11-24 19:08:39 U smell like used cooking oil
9309 2018-11-24 19:08:33 I went to get an oil change today and I guess I looked like I was in a bad mood or something because I was tired. The dude walks up to my window and says “man, you need some pussy, you look depressed”. Idk wtf just happened.
9310 2018-11-24 19:08:03 Northwestern (7-4, 7-1) has already clinched the West Division of the Big Ten and will play next Saturday against most likely the winner of Michigan-Ohio State at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.
9311 2018-11-24 19:08:01 Yeah, just start slowly, it made me sick when I tried it. I’m trying to slowly add MCT oil now, not sure if the benefits are the same but I think they’re similar.

9315 2018-11-24 19:07:42 Never underestimate the pain & suffering that the itchy stage of growing your beard back gives. No lotion or beard oil in the world can help 
9316 2018-11-24 19:07:34 Oil price continue decreasing for last one month.
9317 2018-11-24 19:07:03 yeah, if you take this margin, and then force multiply it by the existence of 5+ billion individual screens, you quickly realize that prognostication is the new snake oil...
9318 2018-11-24 19:06:46 Tea tree. First we oil and tea tree. Then wash. Then chemicals, combing in between. Twice. So I KNOW we’re clear now. Over to scatty Mum....
9319 2018-11-24 19:06:35 ang kati aman nitong shark oil ?!? bahala na tiis ganda wahahhaha
9320 2018-11-24 19:06:28 YOU AND THISE THAT SIT IN POSITIONS like yours have enabled this. Climate change? Really. But hts ok for deforestation, oil through the seas and land causing spillage, fracking, and you want to speak if climate change? What the hell have you and Dems ever done about it
9321 2018-11-24 19:06:14 All the experts say that a pipeline that gets our product to the world market is the answer, doing so will add 80 million dollars a day to Canada coffers. But don’t believe them, take the word of someone whose made a career out of land locking CDN oil for the benefit of the USA.
9322 2018-11-24 19:06:11 I just wanted my oil changed  fmlfmlfmlfmlfml
9323 2018-11-24 19:06:03 Anthony Bourdain had this to say about truffle oil, “It’s not even food. It’s about as edible as Astroglide and made from the same stuff,”
9324 2018-11-24 19:06:00 @TuckerCarlson —Government act. off. Americans killed by illegal aliens daily 26. Where is the outrage on the left? have over 50,000 in our federal prisons? Where is the outrage? Over a barrel of oil? President T. win in 2020 to keep us safe; & build a 50 foot earth wall & ditch
9325 2018-11-24 19:05:56 พยายามยุคับ
9326 2018-11-24 19:05:54 The big issue is the we will be 10 billion.

Oil was okay when only .3 billion could afford it.  At 10 billion, we drown in Texas tea.

It's that simple: we can't afford 10 billion first worlders.

There are options. Lots of them.

 Reducing oil seems like the sanest.
9327 2018-11-24 19:05:53 the motor oil pancake shocked me,, like what kind of person thought of this
9328 2018-11-24 19:05:42 Do u think this could give oil a low 4 to mid 3 handle in the next 6/8 weeks or has that news priced in now @jimiuorio @Sarge986
9329 2018-11-24 19:05:41 On that oil
9330 2018-11-24 19:05:32 Think optimism would come from D returning to form, or top players returning from injury. Opponents have nothing to do with anything when our boys are leaking oil.
9331 2018-11-24 19:05:30 $SDRL more downside here with oil price dropping
9332 2018-11-24 19:05:05 The next knee jerk response to the oil lobby.
9333 2018-11-24 19:04:49 I’m tryna get this oil change then hit up Peter pipers, anyone?
9334 2018-11-24 19:04:47 Oil prices were lower in 2016. Now, what was the name of the President in office at the time?! Not you, demon.
9335 2018-11-24 19:04:31 @_scott_williams: What do you want for Christmas?
Me: A functioning lightsaber, please. I want to be able to chop a car in half with one swipe.
Scott: You know there’s an essential oil for that.

9339 2018-11-24 19:04:05 Price the externalities of the oil industry. Also no subsidies in Belgium!
9340 2018-11-24 19:04:03 Of course he isn’t happy. He also isn’t looking at a mirror thinking why the markets are unstable, why oil is cheap (and the repercussions of that), and why the fed is doing its job restoring rates so that there is room to maneuver when the next recession hits...

9342 2018-11-24 19:03:57 It is disgusting to see a bunch of misinformed broads misinforming people when they criticize something they don’t know anything about. What about Israel, Iran, oil markets, billion follar purchases by Saudis, Siria etc.
9343 2018-11-24 19:03:49 Did you oil barrel? Look like you give your pellet gun a hand job lol
9344 2018-11-24 19:03:31 $7 per gallon is high, current crude oil prices are at below $50 per barrel. I think the % of tax per gallon in France must be huge. Bulk water transportation is not that high. Pipelines? not sure of the logistics in France.
9345 2018-11-24 19:03:28 Oil markets manipulation and certain DOoM @Scientists4EU @mikegalsworthy processes must be timed - t is key ... @vincecable @catherinemep @GermanyDiplo @joswinson @CarolineLucas can skip certain processes and order in which must occur - not enough battery at mo @natalieben
9346 2018-11-24 19:03:28 First day back... getting an oil change & filled up my tank, I have some more adulting to do but that will be tomorrow! Soon I need to start getting ready for Dreamstate and go get my ticket. Why do I feel like I need all day to get ready for this?!

9350 2018-11-24 19:02:57 The warning about the next century comes too late! We all starved to death because Malthus predicted food production can’t keep up. Then we ran out of oil & metals: Tech-driven civilization collapsed. Also ice age came. And then the ozone hole fried the stragglers. So sad!
9351 2018-11-24 19:02:46 I hope you know you’re the reason I bought oil pastels. 
9352 2018-11-24 19:02:45 @Bill_Morneau Every heard of a little thing called OIL.
9353 2018-11-24 19:02:31 Maybe, also thinking slowing [global] economies less demand for oil & base metals
9354 2018-11-24 19:02:30 This is the year I officially feel old. My amazon wishlist consists of cookbooks, cast iron cookware, essential oil books, and I did have a sewing machine I decided to remove

9356 2018-11-24 19:02:27 Bottom line is this.  Car fuel, not big an issue.  Heating Oil - big issue.  20% increase.  Most have a few euro left at the end of the month, means they won't have heating.  AND - €300 BILLION project tax income, only €50 MILLION goes to green carbon tax.  Scam to prop ...
9357 2018-11-24 19:02:11 It’s what the oil folks live off in Texas..That’s how they’re are able to continue to steal sacred land all over the US for that matter and everything else they see fit! Fucking bible thumping and yet obey nothing of a commandment.
9358 2018-11-24 19:02:05 My doctor says I have to become a fish oil supplement guy or I will have a swollen brain (two much knowledge)
9359 2018-11-24 19:02:02 What are pipelines going to do?Just bring more oil into the market,Besides nobody wants Alberta’s shitty tar sands crap anyways
9360 2018-11-24 19:02:01 And i could be burning oil fields for fun in my spare time and it still wouldnt invalidate global warming science so this shows why ad hominem arguments dont work. Humans have kniwn theyre logically irrelevant for thousands of years
9361 2018-11-24 19:01:45 But I do remember oil changes 
9362 2018-11-24 19:01:45 And Canada has just reported it's taking away The carbon tax from the oil energy groups to ease their financial losses and increase production on drilling and refiners and transport by rail to USA .. we are in the same hemisphere..
9363 2018-11-24 19:01:32 You do know we buy Saudi oil and don't use Canadian Oil lol
9364 2018-11-24 19:01:31 I'm not disagreeing with you at all but where would we go (independent, join US??) and who would be with us (provinces) and "how would we get oil etc. to the world?" would likely still be an issue.

9382 2018-11-24 18:59:38 ..they call it ' selling out

9383 2018-11-24 18:59:34 Since we're on the topic of giving everything away we possibly can, perhaps Mrs May will give the Shetlands, and no doubt all the oil and gas, back to Norway.

9387 2018-11-24 18:59:15 Saudi Arabia the country that has no problem with dismemering people alive is only restocked 11% of our oil. While Canad is responsible for 42%
9388 2018-11-24 18:59:13 Maybe Macron can let Saudi Arabia murder a Saudi journalist who resides in France . Then they can get cheaper oil from Saudis if they look the other way

9397 2018-11-24 18:57:41 Yup ~ exactly that. A healthier alternative doesn’t need to be a pharmaceutical ‘medication’ ~ people enjoy eating healthier snacks, foods without added palm oil etc etc., 
The option of accessing affordable risk reduced alternatives which are also ENJOYABLE is plain common sense
9398 2018-11-24 18:57:39 @cafreeland Please wake Justin up. We used to have a significant oil industry.

9411 2018-11-24 18:56:39 I could have done this oil change myself if I knew it’d take them this damn long.
9412 2018-11-24 18:56:35 Thank you. So not many options to save sometimes oil. I use Phoenix, Akagi, Kaga and Hood for Trash. For the boss node i use Enterprise, Nelson, Hyuuga, Prinz Eugen, Minneapolis and Laffey Variant.

I'm impressed everytime i see that Phoenix can actually solotank the trashfleets
9413 2018-11-24 18:56:28 Rising global demand for palm oil has fuelled deforestation in parts of south east Asia, which is why we have set targets to ensure that the palm oil we use comes from sustainable sources. All palm oil and derivatives used as an ingredient in our own brand products (2)
9414 2018-11-24 18:56:25 not even, it’s so easy, get a small tupperware, use like 1 cup of brown sugar and then eyeball the oil so it’s not too runny. you’ll be able to tell lol

9422 2018-11-24 18:55:47 Canada is week and in a desperate situation.  Either conservatives or liberals, who cares. We have problems that need addressing.  The USA is about to flood the world with oil and it’s going to drive prices down and crash the alberta economy.
9423 2018-11-24 18:55:42 Hey Emily! We are committed to responsible sourcing and look to use supply chain systems which minimise the environmental impact associated with the production of key commodities.  Palm oil is an important ingredient in a range of everyday products (1)
9424 2018-11-24 18:55:32 It's pretty damn red!! Gas/oil industry has brought out ALL the greed!! Plus between the gerrymandering and the screwed up state tax laws, the middle class on down is who's paying the price!!
9425 2018-11-24 18:55:32 And they also fight what could be legitimate assistance for addicts. CBD oil and medical cannabis. Another condition I know about is PTSD and I can share with you that one 10 mg cannabis gummy 3 years ago relieved my symptoms more than any Rx medication.
9426 2018-11-24 18:55:31 I know damn well i’m allergic to tea tree oil but you know what i did ???? Fucking apply on a serum that has that EXACT ingredient
9427 2018-11-24 18:55:29  Nope, the Ferrari is on stands right now for winter maintenance. Need to do change the coolant, flush the brake system, and change out the gear oil. You have to do this every two years because all these systems are made out of aluminum. 
9428 2018-11-24 18:55:27 Palm oil is not just bad shit environmentally, but healthwise. It's highly saturated -- more saturated than lard, I think -- and will dance a tarantella on your arteries.

9430 2018-11-24 18:55:09 We have oil in Scotland yet the current price is £1.20 per litre. 
Equivalent to £4.54 ($5.82) per US gallon.
We are being shafted under the guise of environmental responsibility.
#Thieves
9431 2018-11-24 18:55:05 The issue is clean, drinking water. There's no end of the dirty, polluted stuff. The good stuff is more valuable than oil...you can't drink oil, or use oil to irrigate crops. We will learn to look after it...or die.

9436 2018-11-24 18:54:51 You know what I mean. Industrialists, technologists, progressives. Solutions don't come from gov't. They come from hands on folks doing good things. You all hate oil? That's fine, it's only got you to where you are today as a species. At least acknowledge it and be appreciative.
9437 2018-11-24 18:54:46 If aging is a function of maintenance cost, your hypothesis is completely false. An oil service on those cars can be 1k USD+. Beautiful cars those.

9440 2018-11-24 18:54:36 Yes it is...instead of answering question you asked about Oil/Gas subsidies..So im rather sure you’re confusing tax breaks vs subsidies. Also, you failed again to even answer ONE of the questions i asked you. You just keep spinning a fantasy that works only in your mind.
9441 2018-11-24 18:54:34 The oil sitting on top of her gravy is upsetting me
9442 2018-11-24 18:54:31 The things people will do for oil. Are these morons safe or will they have a tragic accident like Khoshoggi & trip over a chainsaw or fall in a vat of acid. Trump will find an excuse for the Saudis if it did happen, no doubt. He values oil above everything else.

9445 2018-11-24 18:54:29 Colorado is an oil/gas and agriculture state. There is no affordable green work vehicle on the horizon. Farmers and laborers will be priced into welfare/bankruptcy by the poorly thought out implementation of this standard. Lets revisit and develop a plan that includes CO workers.

9454 2018-11-24 18:53:18 1/2But this is our own government reporting on how climate change is going to affect the US and yes. There will be money that needs to be spent. Let's take the 23 billion in oil and gas subsidies last year and move to expand green subsidies instead, that's how 'they' want cash.
9455 2018-11-24 18:52:45 Im the man your mcm come to when he need his car fixed cause he wanted those big wheels on his car and chose to opt out on balljoints and wheel bearings and the wheel sent thru the fender cause he wanted only an oil change. 
9456 2018-11-24 18:52:38 The only reason the Sentinelese have their private island is because they don't have oil underneath their soil.

9459 2018-11-24 18:52:28 SNP voters think oil is the answer to everything when Venezuela, Iraq, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia might beg to differ.
9460 2018-11-24 18:52:28 When talking with climate deniers, focus on the basics first.
Carbon in trees (coal, oil) mfg’d from CO2 in air. 
(Photosynthesis ->sugar -cellulose)
Trees, coal, oil store Carbon
Burning adds CO2 to air. (Post Ind Rev)
Higher temps linked to more CO2 in air.
Then let it sink in.
9461 2018-11-24 18:52:27 At this point I welcome the climate disaster. I find it particularly comforting that the midwest will suffer. I hope all climate deniers, big oil liars & Trump supporters survive and are forced to suffer through the after effects. Does this make me a bad person?

9463 2018-11-24 18:52:27 so neem oil is the only thing tht works for my skin as it turns out
9464 2018-11-24 18:52:17 You dey Lag?
9465 2018-11-24 18:52:14 Curiosity over this nag champa Shea soap & kush hair oil. 
9466 2018-11-24 18:52:12 Same here! Hair needs water to grow and hold moisture! When you just apply oil without a water base, the oils just sit on your hair.
9467 2018-11-24 18:52:09 Please take those dwindling expensive oil fields by all means
9468 2018-11-24 18:52:05 Thank the USA for that then. After all the majority of oil tankers plying the west coast waters are theirs and not Canadian.

9471 2018-11-24 18:51:45 The Neo-Islamic Imperial Army of Iran has invaded revolting countries in the Middle East and supported revolutionaries. Khan has been named the Supreme Leader of Iran, and is in talks with Britain and France for free trade on oil.
9472 2018-11-24 18:51:44 I’m glad it’s helping you! I’m trying out some CBD oil from a company called Endoca. It’s helping a little - I hope I get preventative results as I increase my dose.
9473 2018-11-24 18:51:43 More oil leads to more greenhouse gases, which leads to more fires in California, Hurricanes in the Southeast, and more displacement in the Middle East.  It would be cheaper to put oil workers on Welfare and use solar than your plan.  Obama got it just fine, long term thinking.
9474 2018-11-24 18:51:31 The discount we are offering on a single quart of oil is greater than the case discount.  A quart of RP21530 that normally has an EDLP of $12.95/qt and a case price of $11.66/qt is $10.36/qt for the sale.
9475 2018-11-24 18:51:30 Loved the addition of the truffle oil too!
9476 2018-11-24 18:51:27 2019. Indyref2. Oil is running out
9477 2018-11-24 18:51:26 The Line 9 reversal has been a good decision. Ontario refineries are largely off foreign oil and Quebec's refineries have decreased their receipt of same by at least one-half.
9478 2018-11-24 18:51:23 Your thread went to crap thanks to Amy. What farmers are you talking about that mix oil into their irrigation?
9479 2018-11-24 18:51:18 put castor oil on your hair and keep it all the night and the morning wash your hair ( u can do this how many times u want)
9480 2018-11-24 18:50:59 i usually store the garlic i poach in olive oil in those. they're great for that.
9481 2018-11-24 18:50:58 Butt's  puppet ,Trudeau, is following through on Butt's plan, to landlock Albertan oil
9482 2018-11-24 18:50:54 It'd be cool to pick and choose pieces of jobs and work as 1099. I.e. 350hrs/yr at my current job only doing $NATGAS, crude oil, coal daily & weekly research reports.
9483 2018-11-24 18:50:53 Yes. Except no. 

Lanolin is the oil from sheep’s …um. Parts. Wool. Stuff. 

It’s a bit sticky at first, but it’s incredibly moisturising. 

You can get it from most pharmacies under the brand “Lansinoh” - it’s used by nursing mothers for cracked and sore nipples.
9484 2018-11-24 18:50:47 fish oil pills have been helping my face out soo much in this dry ass weather
9485 2018-11-24 18:50:40 Bruce banner is so damn skunky  & its potent af, I made some oil with only 2 grams & it was some of the most potent edibles I've had
9486 2018-11-24 18:50:14 Could say the same about the current Government towards teachers, midwives, nurses... Can't remember the last time oil workers striked.
9487 2018-11-24 18:50:04 Hmmm.  I’d rather use olive oil for cooking I think.  There are various spreads but most pretty grim.  Since I bloat with bread I might as well give that up too then there’s no need for butter #toast #justeatingair
9488 2018-11-24 18:50:01 i am oil painter .. so.. it's not the end of the world. I think I will avoid landscapes for a while.
9489 2018-11-24 18:50:00 Money he's getting from oil companies, you can buy air filtration systems and water purifiers for his children. Well everybody else chokes to death are dies of water borne illnesses may God blast Trump into Oblivion. The Reincarnation of Adolf Hitler is in the White House impeach
9490 2018-11-24 18:49:58 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
9491 2018-11-24 18:49:58 One example, Jimmy Carter put solar panels on the White House and Ronald Reagan took them down.  So fuck right off with your ignorance.  If not for GOP being in the pockets of big oil, we could have had fully electric vehicles 30 years ago, staving off MUCH climate damage.
9492 2018-11-24 18:49:53 Hyper capitalism, a focus on market gains at the expense of most every other value in domestic & foreign policy, now threatens democracy around the world. Example: exploitation of oil in Yemen, with little effort at institution building, led to kleptocracy & ultimately collapse.

9494 2018-11-24 18:49:29 What wrong with palm oil?  Does it have a harsh taste or is it a personal preference?
9495 2018-11-24 18:49:21 Anty the oil on your face can fry Akara welll
9496 2018-11-24 18:49:13 The way Chelsea fc are going down,
I'm sure they'll eventually discover oil.
9497 2018-11-24 18:49:08 @realDonaldTrump Hey fuckface, oil is lower because you told Saudi Arabia you'd look the other way after they tortured and killed a US resident. You have two years and then you're no one. Back to being a Z-list celebrity with a shitty TV show no one watches. Fuck off, you twat.
9498 2018-11-24 18:49:08 As I mentioned in another tweet market needs to get back into equilibrium. Saudis and Russians will see to this Trump or no Trump. Sentiment can change quickly. Does Trump realise $50 oil will bankrupt the shale industry?
9499 2018-11-24 18:49:05 Ignorance of this idiot is pathetic.  A 20% increase of all oil, including heating oil.  Most poor, elderly have €15 at the end of the month, now they can't afford heat.  People will die.  And, out €300 BN raised, only €50Million goes to green energy, the rest to the 'Budget'.

9503 2018-11-24 18:48:51 A mix of avocado, almond, olive and a lil peppermint and tea tree if you can. I recommend mixing some leave in conditioner and water to spray your roots first and then follow up with oil.
9504 2018-11-24 18:48:47 No, not subsisides like green energy requires. Fed govt (& Most state govs) benefit MORE in tax revenues & fees than oil/gas companies do. That’s a “whataboutism” though..
for 3rd time now, im asking U to answer what should be simple questions if your goals are so feesable. So?

9506 2018-11-24 18:48:42 @pixelfederation I accidentally hit “refresh oil field”. Even though I have “confirm gem purchases” turned on, it took 120 gems from me without confirming. I’ve been saving those forever, and I would like them refunded, please.
9507 2018-11-24 18:48:38 All of oil is sooo good, especially when you saw tay onions in it. It smells so good 
9508 2018-11-24 18:48:37 go ask ibu for axe brand medicated oil and rub a bit on your nostrils. if takut too panas, rub on handkerchief and sniff it. it helps, trust me i have sinus for 22 years alr

9510 2018-11-24 18:48:29 Never tried clove oil. I’m going shopping tomorrow so teething gel is on the list! Thanks
9511 2018-11-24 18:48:14 It was in the mid-1970s that the British Pharmacopoeia, a publication of medical substance quality standards for the UK, released a licensed cannabis tincture which featured CBD in full-spectrum oil intended for therapeutic usage. #cbd #cbdoil #discusscannabis #cannabidiol

9516 2018-11-24 18:47:46 i’m just wondering why bmw charged me $463 for an oil change & filter change ?????
9517 2018-11-24 18:47:44 Because the oil companies and coal companies lobbied him are in other words paid him off 2 pretend he doesn't know. It's all about greed in his life. he's condemning his stupid children too bad air, bad water just for profit. But with the money he's getting from oil companies
9518 2018-11-24 18:47:43 It is Fractionated Coconut oil. I have Peppermint, Speamint, Lemon and Citrus.
9519 2018-11-24 18:47:28 So it’s very strange that “the high price of petrol” is listed as the main demand of protesters. It’s almost as if they wanted to protest, looked for a popular reason - petrol prices - (which France has no control over because they have no oil) then the price of petrol fell…
9520 2018-11-24 18:47:22 I sincerely hope the House Dems pick 1 investigation and 1 only for Trump. The conspiracy with the Russians over the oil deal with Exxon Mobil, which might show Trumps' reasons for Rex Tillerson appointment and then go from there.

9526 2018-11-24 18:46:59 Wow!! This looks more like an oil painting  than a   picture. Perfect for a ad
9527 2018-11-24 18:46:45 Plus I believe storage was upped at a lot of locations like Strathcona and Hardisty, no?   I’ve been focused on potstocks so oil info isn’t my expertise lately.
9528 2018-11-24 18:46:34 Ey dude I'm a mechanic and I'm always greasy with oil,  I could never be so clean which actually despresses me...I'm greasy right now

9532 2018-11-24 18:46:11 Ugh. If you use Essential oil Frankincense is great and diffuse arborvitae and lime. Hope you feel better.
9533 2018-11-24 18:46:01 US sends billions to Saudi Arabia for oil which only comes back if they buy our goods like jet airliners, arms etc... is not good to encourage them to send thise US $$$ to Russia n China n drive our gas to $4/Gal , Focus Ur outrage on the 148 people killed today by Radical Islam
9534 2018-11-24 18:46:00 (You would want to be invested if you want to be diversified, but to maximize profits you dont)so you dont just switch to that. First you delay consensus as long as possible to extract your oil and when you are done you switch. [6]
9535 2018-11-24 18:45:50 Yo @POTUS how’s your stock market doing? Haven’t heard your updates lately. Saw you did your thing with oil. You should make the stock market bullish again.

9540 2018-11-24 18:45:05 This ignorance and greed has a human cost globally. We need state incentives to have solar on home rooftops as in European countries, wind energy supporting cities and farms. We are so behind the rest of the world because of dinosaur white men invested in oil.
9541 2018-11-24 18:44:58 Gas is already 7 bucks a gallon there, with record low world oil prices.
9542 2018-11-24 18:44:40 "The number of active oil rigs decreasing by 3 to reach 885 and the number of gas rigs holding steady at 194.

The oil and gas rig count is now 156 up from this time last year." RigCount

9544 2018-11-24 18:44:34 Renewable energy, electric cars (guess what? pragerU also made a video about how electric cars are a scam and suprise its also full of lies). So as a guy owning a oil source you dont want to also be in the electric car development business same goes for renewable energy [5]
9545 2018-11-24 18:44:29 on and Sons or Roob Coccola or, for the matter of that, O’Connell’s famous old Dublin ale that he wanted like hell,

9547 2018-11-24 18:44:22 Would have just lengthened the process. Earnings would still be under pressure and oil would still be in bear territory. Rate hikes wouldn’t be accepted well, regardless.
9548 2018-11-24 18:44:10 @EmmanuelMacron is having his 'let them eat cake' moment in France while Trump unleashed America's full power to keep oil prices low. How bout that nationalism? @StevePieczenik @geraldcelente @allidoisowen

9551 2018-11-24 18:43:42 I would bet most on this thread hate Americans as much as you seem to hate Albertans. Just know PMJT's refusal to push for more market access to Canadian oil is giving  the USA a multi million $ gift everyday.
9552 2018-11-24 18:43:35 i took sugai to an auto shop so he can get stuff to change the oil in my car and this is always so boring. i feel like one of those terrible boyfriends who doesnt care and just wants to sit down but there are never any chairs
9553 2018-11-24 18:43:34 Explain how you'll accomplish anything without oil.  Everything depends on oil at some point, absolutely everything.  Manufacture, packaging, delivery to market, consumer to store, and sometimes even use.  I'm just thinking about a carrot or tomato too btw.
9554 2018-11-24 18:43:28 I definitely have to get my oil changed next week
9555 2018-11-24 18:43:27 You know, it happens they were right. Climate change is happening big time right now exactly because we didn’t stop burning stuff 20 or 40 yrs ago. And it will get worse. Even Oil & gas companies are saying climate change is real. Do you know the amount of IPCC founding?
9556 2018-11-24 18:43:14 Chucks them in the oil like frisbees
9557 2018-11-24 18:43:13 Do like cities every where, sue oil companies to take responsibility for their actions. Like new York or in  california... The oil companies knew 30years ago. According to their own research...
9558 2018-11-24 18:43:10 give it a bit of an oil x
9559 2018-11-24 18:43:03 Where is Shk.Rasheed? He won the 1918 election on promise to expose  LNG scam. Many clauses are non-transp. in LNG deal with Qatar.LNG price of 13% Brent oil price is higher. At that time it was 11% of Texas crude inter'ally. Brent is higher so we pay 3-4% more & other clauses
9560 2018-11-24 18:42:47 them come to a consensus. Thats their gameplan. They dont try to prove to everyone that climate change is a hoax. They cant. They only want to delay consensus to realize their oil value. 
What also leads to lower oil prices? Less demand. What leads to less demand? [4]
9561 2018-11-24 18:42:42 It's avaliable point, however I really think publicly slamming them isn't needed right now due to there massive u turn on palm oil, thay are making a massive effort and I think thay will address this issue thats concerning you, ide hope so anyway x
9562 2018-11-24 18:42:40 Started brushing my teeth w coconut oil past couple days shits been v healthy, good move ree
9563 2018-11-24 18:42:39 Check out go max go! They do use palm oil iirc but they’re all vegan versions of popular chocolate.
9564 2018-11-24 18:42:26 I dip the pounded veal in flour mixed with salt & pepper. Then I dip it in eggs. Then I bread it in normal breadcrumbs which I seasoned again with sweet paprika and salt. Fried in very hot oil. Easy and a perfect result.
9565 2018-11-24 18:42:15 It feels good but then you have your monthly payments, oil changes and other things . Then it feels horrible

9573 2018-11-24 18:41:39 Prediction: within two years, the oil industry will be touting this as a solution, and James Woods will be 100% in favor.
9574 2018-11-24 18:41:35 Yes, he should be ashamed for buying a stalled pipeline project to try to get AB oil to "tidewater". What was he thinking?
9575 2018-11-24 18:41:32 And you don’t see the conceit involved in that POV? 
You mentioned Nixon earlier. Have you reflected on the damage his presidency did? The inevitable Carter years where oil dependency & Iranian terror were born?
He relieved the Dems of the burden of running against Hoover forever
9576 2018-11-24 18:41:31 I think your best bet if there are trees is to distill and crack pine tar. Look up cracking crude oil
9577 2018-11-24 18:41:30 obama is a corrupt, liar.  He's nothing but a snake oil salesman. His smooth talking, pc nonsense is one reason President Trump won. And you should watch how you throw that "r" word around. It is as offensive as the "n" word. Stay grubered or wake up. Read up. Man/woman up.
9578 2018-11-24 18:41:16 The only real climate refugees should be politicians, oil company execs, and disinformation artists whose houses are seized to provide shelter to people who are displaced by wildfire, drought, rising sea levels, and all that other climate changey shit.
9579 2018-11-24 18:41:16 Carry on status about right. Still, now tantalisingly close to the oil.

9581 2018-11-24 18:41:12 Where can I get an oil change today and not have to wait 3.5 hours?

9585 2018-11-24 18:41:02 & congress did shit for the last 18 yrs over saudi involvement in 9 11. Incl Bush & Obama. Kashoogi was deemed a ex pat traitor by saudis. Hes not a us citizen. U want an oil embargo & gas ration lines like we had in the 70's.
9586 2018-11-24 18:40:55 Whats harming your business in this situation? Lower oil prices in the future and regulations against oil (also leads to lower oil prices).
Climate change consensus leads to regulations against oil usage so you gold to maximize your oil value while you extract is is to not let[3]
9587 2018-11-24 18:40:37 MFers always going on about the price of oil, find away to lower the price of milk and I’ll fucking praise and vote for you.

9591 2018-11-24 18:40:15 The economy is tanking, oil per barrel is dropping too
9592 2018-11-24 18:40:14 You look like Olive Oil 
9593 2018-11-24 18:40:08 C'mon team, trump and facts are oil and water, with trump being the slimy oil.
9594 2018-11-24 18:40:05 えー年上おねーさんの件について発表します！今回は！ご縁がなかったということで！はい！泣いています！！

9596 2018-11-24 18:39:58 I use almond oil thank you. But I don’t take those kinds of pics anyway lol

9598 2018-11-24 18:39:44 Helping I think? A very large quantity of anecdotal reports detail remarkable results with cannabis oil on
many different forms of cancer. One of the most important properties of cannabis as a
cancer therapy is that it is non-toxic and even if little therapeutic effect

9600 2018-11-24 18:39:21 giving up profit to the buyer and only getting a % of the full value. So the play for maximum value is to extract the oil and sell it yourself. That needs a lot of time. 
So the situation is a guy that needs a lof of time to realize his oilvalue. [2]
9601 2018-11-24 18:39:12 Sorry @Paola_Dec1231 , I am going to disagree with you on this one .  We all use oil .  Gasoline is derived from oil , plastic products , ashphalt many different uses . Without it we are screwed .
9602 2018-11-24 18:39:08 -Put some ice on it.

-Check your diet.

-Tap on Tea Tree Oil.

-Use salicylic acid products

-Use Benzoyl peroxide products

-Dont touch your face.

-Dont pick on the pimples.
9603 2018-11-24 18:39:06 Dropped my car off at 9:45 for an oil change lol
9604 2018-11-24 18:39:04 what medium? oil/acrylic? love this texture
9605 2018-11-24 18:39:03 Can you debate the deficit and lack of pipeline for Alberta Oil? Oh right, that doesn’t matter to you clowns, or is probably just to complicated for you to understand
9606 2018-11-24 18:38:55 I really think that the massive effort thay are making with the palm oil is a first step in a very long road for humanity. I'm proud to shop there, but I don't buy dead animals though so I don't have the same issues as you seem to be having x
9607 2018-11-24 18:38:53 Oil Money > Borrowed Money.
9608 2018-11-24 18:38:52 It's like hammering oil by tweet, HFT, and secret deals. It will lead to higher oil prices.
9609 2018-11-24 18:38:28 You could also just buy him some gun oil. Those boys use that shit like cologne.
9610 2018-11-24 18:38:23 @LBC oil price has fallen so why are fuel prices rising in france
9611 2018-11-24 18:38:16 Mr trump i have a question for you concerning oil prices,,you say they are dropping ,i have seen it elswhere,but here in alaska fuel still 4 bucks a gallon,,we cant afford to heat our home,furthermore we are an oil producing state,,there is a refinery two miles away ,,
9612 2018-11-24 18:38:00 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts olive oil with 1 part orange juice and 1 part cashew butter. Add blue cheese crumbles and molasses to taste.
9613 2018-11-24 18:37:57 My hair smells like tea tree oil and willow bark extract

9616 2018-11-24 18:37:39 I dunno about fraud, but there's definitely something misleading in that article. Namely, the climate denial in the introduction. (There's plenty of unsettled science, but burning billions of barrels of oil definitely causes harm. I'd like to see electric cars soon.) I'm out.
9617 2018-11-24 18:37:32 And remember that the baseline in 2018 having the biggest oil reserves in the world should be exceedingly higher than 1960 WHITE mortality
9618 2018-11-24 18:37:22 I see the proliferation of the 20 liter drum of home heating oil is back in local garages ... recovery ?
9619 2018-11-24 18:37:19 In 2013 Brian Ashcroft @fai said 70% of all oil & gas industry post-tax profits are remitted abroad. This amounted then to around £19bn which he said “reflects high degree of foreign ownership” .   That's what being in the UK achieved.  It's probably got worse since then.
9620 2018-11-24 18:37:15 Who got tha oil
9621 2018-11-24 18:37:03 My wife is allergic to pine oil, so we have an artificial tree. Saves $, and our 3 cats would rub all over it. Also no pine needles to vacuum up until June.
9622 2018-11-24 18:37:00 Wrong-wrong and wrong...
Man ur level of knowledge is scary
1- not a positional player as Tuchel like them (Even if he can play is any system). 
2/Qatar is about gas not oil and its only approx 20% of PSG’s budget 
3/they offered the same absurd money (he refused)
9623 2018-11-24 18:36:57 The person who discovered that coconut oil can be used as a make up remover as well, is the real MVP 
9624 2018-11-24 18:36:47 $GDX, $NUGT, Something I haven't heard much about yet here is what impact does this oil rout have on Gold/Silver Miners. I.E. what % of capex is spent on oil/gas for mining? Having a hard time digging up this info.  @GlobalProTrader @IKN_Mark @TFMetals
9625 2018-11-24 18:36:43 The good news is French communists haven't been paying attention to the crashing price of oil and have decided to 1848 the House of Macron.
9626 2018-11-24 18:36:42 I’m supposed to be changing my oil but I’m watching football instead.
9627 2018-11-24 18:36:37 What was the $1b taken from the crude oil account used in purchasing? Moribund and outdated hardware from Pakistan and Afghanistan?
9628 2018-11-24 18:36:35 ok fuck it. lets do this. The goal here is clearly maximising profit. 
Lets say guy A owns an oil source (where it is and what it is isnt really relevant). That source has a lot of value that but he cant realize maximum value instantly. He could sell it, but that means [1]
9629 2018-11-24 18:36:33 in Paris they are paying 7 USD/Gallon for gasoline whereas in the US i'm paying 2.3 USD/Gallon. Macron is increasing fuel prices even though oil prices dropped from 80USD/barrel to 50. How else will the gov pay for all the refugees, free health care, education...etc #YellowVests
9630 2018-11-24 18:36:23 It is not just more oil. It is enough capacity to different customers than the US to get our oil UP to the world market price. With friends like you all on this thread who needs enemies. @jamft @WBrettWilson
9631 2018-11-24 18:36:22 Gas strikes in Paris?  MBS,Trump,Putin meeting Buenos Aires early Dec to

finance lavish lifestyles of hundreds of princes....Germany sideing with
Putin for Oil ?  Time to think mon ami about your direction..
9632 2018-11-24 18:36:16 En todo este ambiente, como ves a PBR? A pesar de precio oil me gusta un montón igual. Que opinas?
9633 2018-11-24 18:36:13 Trying oil executives at the Hague is OK, but what happened to the Romanov family would be way cooler.
9634 2018-11-24 18:36:06 warned the World and Billionaires here on Twitter what will happen if they don't spend money on fossil fuels and Animal Agriculture. The entire West Coast of America will SHAKE violently and tsunamis will strike. Oil fracking and coal blasting in California has no regulations
9635 2018-11-24 18:35:56 Manuel - I need more oil!
9636 2018-11-24 18:35:55 Bringing in cheap Oil from Saudi thus taking away from  companies right after he lowered thier taxes so way less money for the government could very well be a strategy for Saudi @realDonaldTrump is a moron remember God is in control. Have a blessed day.

9648 2018-11-24 18:34:55 I think televangelism works well for him: Fraudulence . Horrible music. Snake oil. Loads of cash. Corruption. Stupidity.
9649 2018-11-24 18:34:54 It is a possibility. I just think it's a bit much to suggest every single one of these studies is for money because a) oil companies would pay you a fortune for combatting theories and b) I and others did basic research on these topics in uni for no money and it's all pretty true
9650 2018-11-24 18:34:53 We're not exactly celebrating, we won't see a penny of any of it. Is it ok for the UK gov to use these "previously  non existent pre  indyref" oil fields to collect revenue, but not an  independent Scotland? Do you think Ian Woods cares about climate change or getting wealthier?
9651 2018-11-24 18:34:52 Umm the US just became the worlds largest oil supplier
9652 2018-11-24 18:34:51 I’m genuinely quite impressed at the volume of ‘secret oil fields’ tweets over the last couple of days. Amazed that so many are so willing to admit to being so stupid. Fair play.
9653 2018-11-24 18:34:36 I’m being a responsible adult and getting my oil changed only 3,000+ mi over when I was supposed to have it done.

9655 2018-11-24 18:34:16 as oil price tanks ..
9656 2018-11-24 18:34:15 Agreed!  Not sure if they have enough oil for that fry.
9657 2018-11-24 18:34:07 cool, never tried rapeseed oil my own self.
9658 2018-11-24 18:34:06 Thats what creamer is, sugar and vegetable oil. Go for that half and half, or just milk 
9659 2018-11-24 18:34:03 It’s about discouraging diesel as it’s emissions are more poisonous than petrol (gasoline). But electric cars are too expensive for the average person at the moment. It’s not to do with oil prices.

I had the opportunity to meet the champ @TylerReddick 
 At my home dirt track in wheel tn. When he was racing in the Lucas oil late model dirt series. I bought his shirt and got it signed by tyler. And know he is the 2018 xfinity series champion.
9662 2018-11-24 18:33:49 I’m honestly having trouble coming up with how the US ever “mandated the use of vegetable oil in biofuels.” If the criticism is that the GREET model is missing something, that’s a useful discussion, but this just seems like a straight misrepresentation of the law.
9663 2018-11-24 18:33:45 Once a strong proud political party, now snake oil salesmen. 
9664 2018-11-24 18:33:27 the oil will take care of that sis!
9665 2018-11-24 18:33:17 Eh, just use some coconut oil
9666 2018-11-24 18:33:10 You still seemed sick this morning. So I would like to take care of you (again ). If it's just a cold, you can use "Tea Tree". It's essential oil. Take one or two drops on a sugar or mixed with honey before go to sleep. Do not use pure. The morning will be healed 
9667 2018-11-24 18:32:54 Cuban people live longer than Americans and export doctors. 
Venezuela based their entire economy in oil and failed. 

Nationalism leads to division and war.
Nazi Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of China, and more tried to be nationalists and it lead to their loss.

9673 2018-11-24 18:31:55 Palm oil,rare earth elements,exporting of production to low regulation jurisdictions. I think we are playing a losing shell game.

9676 2018-11-24 18:31:41 This what happen when you knw nothing about oil rates and missed economic classes! Just write any shit on the paper and still the teacher (ur foolish supporters) corrects it!
9677 2018-11-24 18:31:31 I would like to refer you to palm oil as the biggest example of killing the planet and animals....
9678 2018-11-24 18:30:58 It’s garlic, but it’s garlic with a splash of boiling water (to reduce the heinousness), oil, tomatoes and basil. Make a spoonful and feel better! Also oregano oil pills and lots of water.
9679 2018-11-24 18:30:55 if it was drugs or oil or poppies,,, whatever, that is not working,,, the drug epidemic has worsened in America! Opiods etc., everything, we have become a one stop shop for all drugs! its terrible!

9682 2018-11-24 18:30:35 We must get off oil fir OUR National Security!  We have plenty of funds when we stop paying subsidies to gas & oil and give every penny to real wealth builders--renewable infrastructure. How dare you condone MURDER! #noscruples #nomorals #followlaw
9683 2018-11-24 18:30:29 OMG, pls change your oil every 3000 miles or once every three months.
9684 2018-11-24 18:30:23 This won’t age well. I’d bet on massive OOIP’s and declines under 10% over the long term vs “sexy” Tight Oil running 30% + declines with much smaller reserve base. The pain is real now, but that will pass.
9685 2018-11-24 18:30:22 You should grill steaks! Try marinading with 2 8oz steaks with 1/4 cup of diced garlic, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, pinch or to liking salt/pepper (6hrs). Grill steaks and have 1 cup of olive oil and 12 cloves of garlic over medium going in sauce pan. Drizzle 1tabsp of balsamic

9689 2018-11-24 18:29:57 Can they do it without the Oil Money
9690 2018-11-24 18:29:46 So @JustinTrudeau you are effectively killing the oil and gas industry in Alberta. How do you think your precious Quebec is going to feel towards you when they don’t receive their billions in transfer payments! @MaximeBernier and @AndrewScheer should be questioning you on this.
9691 2018-11-24 18:29:37 How can a president cut gas prices, does he own all the oil companies?
9692 2018-11-24 18:29:31 1) The hypocrisy is outstanding. People rather have Saudi Oil vs Canadian Oil? We rather pay more for our Oil than less? We rather put people out of work and harm our economy? We choose to be reckless and harmful than to lead, to be strong, and prosperous.

Snake oil?
9694 2018-11-24 18:29:19 Japan and South Korea may even resume buying oil from #Iran in January, after cutting imports to zero in anticipation of sanctions.
Almost immediately after the waivers were issued, oil prices crashed.
9695 2018-11-24 18:29:11 With all of the market volatility over the last 2 months, I have discerned only one thing - the oil market has given the Fed cover to pause. They will hike in December and then its all data dependent. Powell wants higher rates but he can take longer now.
9696 2018-11-24 18:29:10 ill have to try it then!! i cant really stand the taste of oil 
9697 2018-11-24 18:29:10 I love how all of you radicalized 'progressive' types have started whoring yourselves out for the oil and pipeline industry.  You are so rudderless and believe in absolutely nothing.  It's shameful, frankly.  #ableg #abpoli

9700 2018-11-24 18:29:03 He's actually placed tariffs on Canada despite the fact they're our largest importer of oil, so actually gas prices are down spite of this idiot...

9704 2018-11-24 18:28:37 No, Alberta's main problem is political interference by pretend environmentalists and corrupt Canadian politicians, bought and paid for by US oil interests.

You know, like your party and associates.
9705 2018-11-24 18:28:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
9706 2018-11-24 18:28:35 Isnt it done via a state run oil company or something? I'd have to read more about it. Concerns would be that oil resources are finite and in low oil price years the benefit would also have to be reduced
9707 2018-11-24 18:28:34 The hypocrisy of British Gov't propaganda media outlet #BBC.

9708 2018-11-24 18:28:31 Ok. So what did orange face do to reduce oil prices for crying out loud??  Educate me.
9709 2018-11-24 18:28:31 3billion wasted looking for oil in North East and now this. Just Negodunu! There is Godoo!
9710 2018-11-24 18:28:29 Interesting reflections.

1. How can a nation with so much idle land and so many idle people import US$20 million worth of soya beans a month to produce cooking oil?

2. How can a supposedly broke nation import US$40-80 million worth of fuel per month just for people to burn
9711 2018-11-24 18:28:25 Low oil price equals bigger profits for the investors of the value added products.

Because EVERYTHING is stolen..ALWAYS.

9722 2018-11-24 18:27:30 I think you lack contect, Henry. The "gilet jaunes" are originally a bunch of upper middle class drivers protesting against a simple raise in oil taxes. Basically they are reactionnary. They are responsible of blockades, violence against minorities and so on. 1/2
9723 2018-11-24 18:27:27 The Cons killed the energy east 40 yrs ago...PET and his NEP infrastructure would have been all in place.  "Let those bastards in the east freeze"  Alberta shot themselves in the foot....40 yrs of cons and 11 yrs of Harper..Saudi oil now bothers you...take a hike!!!!
9724 2018-11-24 18:27:23  Solari will make you discover oil too
9725 2018-11-24 18:27:14 It's certainly true that the rate of deforestation is untenable & a good deal of it due to unsustainable palm oil, but the old 300 football fields quote doesn't relate to any peer-reviewed scientific studies. I rather think it was plucked out of the air by an intern or something.
9726 2018-11-24 18:27:13 Snake Oil.
9727 2018-11-24 18:27:12 Also any Indian store... “tiger balm” it is 927474x stronger than peppermint oil and I find it to work a lot better!
9728 2018-11-24 18:27:03 By junk fats, I’m referring to the industrial types (seed oils). Coconut oil, olive oil and animal fats all healthy in my book. Nice to see chips not made with garbage.  Happy crunching!
9729 2018-11-24 18:26:59 that is true my friend. pool showed great character. a part of me still says that city will have the final call on the title race and not ppol even though nobody wants oil money to win
9730 2018-11-24 18:26:57 Yooo nooo.. su "oil field" o "welder" man es el que le pega
9731 2018-11-24 18:26:36 I can foresee myself burning midnight oil during mst week 
9732 2018-11-24 18:26:29 coconut oil
9733 2018-11-24 18:26:12 please mention why oil prices have dropped,may be somethibg to do with the Saudis murdering someone
9734 2018-11-24 18:26:08 @TwopTwips CHRIS REA, now is a good time to start those all important winter safety checks, top up your fluids and check your oil.
9735 2018-11-24 18:26:01 @TracyBrabin no, it's not palm oil again but please don't make light of Sustainability. Batley grew on a shoddy early form of @circulareconomy ?
9736 2018-11-24 18:25:59 Ours is just seasonal but the continued slide in crude oil prices might open another chapter of exodus in Nigeria's case
9737 2018-11-24 18:25:37 What the FUCK is up with so many vegan products containing palm oil? I’m....disgusted
9738 2018-11-24 18:25:34 If by "innovator" you really mean "snake oil salesman who can't develop a business model that doesn't involve subsidizing gimmicks for the wealthy on the taxpayer's dime", then, sure.
9739 2018-11-24 18:25:33 Too bad we have oil moguls, coal barons and frackers for EPA directors the next couple of years
9740 2018-11-24 18:25:30 EVs have 90% less moving parts to wear out.   Not a good long term investment to buy a Oil Change facility or auto parts store.
9741 2018-11-24 18:25:24 My skincare routine now become only oil cleanser, cleanser, toner, moisturizer and sunscreen(day). No serum2 mak nenek dah bcs im too lazy
9742 2018-11-24 18:25:20 no one:

Light skins: you gorillas are just jealous because we don’t look like we played in an oil spill as kids smh I’m tired of being bullied by niggers
9743 2018-11-24 18:25:11 Normal working class people depend on Socialism, not Capitalists Tories, Socialism is not Communism far from it, the Venezuela situation was not caused by Communism it was caused by greed, Oil prices, it was once the 4th richest countries in the world, now it s the loorest
9744 2018-11-24 18:25:04 We do that too?  Our original soil is now destroyed by the spilt 8.2million litres of oil that KPC is reporting. Agreed
9745 2018-11-24 18:24:59 But without CBD oil, you’re anxious aren’t you? So you will be depending on it too lmfao..
9746 2018-11-24 18:24:51 These protesters are the same IDIOTS who shut down shale oil/gas exploration in the massive Paris Basin....
9747 2018-11-24 18:24:47 @TitusNation why are you such an idiot? Your last podcast Rae read how the oil company is loosing stock because they caused the ‘campfire’. Yet it is called “Campfire” so idiots like you wonder how it started...as you did.....idiot.
9748 2018-11-24 18:24:46 You could make it a thanksgiving game in Lucas Oil
9749 2018-11-24 18:24:34 Oh...1 more thing...DEMS DO VOTE AGAINST OIL/GAS...they do it ALL THE TIME. Saying “we vote for building jobs” is BULLSHIT. They saddle O/G with high taxes & regulations specifically to try to limit production (as well as other extractive industries like mining).
9750 2018-11-24 18:24:33 Don't worry the Green New Deal will save us.  The extinction rebels protesting in London give us 2yrs max before all gov'ts will be a thing of the past cause petro consummers don't kill only oil co's kill planets.

9754 2018-11-24 18:24:19 My edges flourishing thanks to this Castor oil
9755 2018-11-24 18:24:19 She graduated 4 years AFTER me! I couldn’t BELIEVE it. I’m no prize but compared to her, I look like I’m in my 30’s. She must have spent WAAAY too much time laying out basting in iodine & baby oil.
9756 2018-11-24 18:24:07 President Trump is Smart enough to know they are about out of oil.
they are already Fracking.
Then We open up our Reserves and Compete with Russia.

Saudis will pound ALL THAT SAND.....
9757 2018-11-24 18:23:58 Yep, since WWF erroneously claimed this, it has been repeated and adapted all over the place. Sometimes they say "in Indonesia," or "in Borneo" or "in SE Asia" and vary from "all deforestation" or "deforestation for oil palm" and "per second," "per minute" and "per hour..."
9758 2018-11-24 18:23:57 The great part about painting with oil paints is the high you get from inhaling the fumes
9759 2018-11-24 18:23:52 How do farmers feed the world when they can’t get their goods to market because we are transporting oil by train? Don’t eat any food, don’t drive a vehicle or fly an airplane do ya? It’s supply and demand. We have the supply and demand but our leader is a fool. Good luck to you!
9760 2018-11-24 18:23:52 The POTUS needs $30 oil for his social programs  #OOTT #natgas  (This is an attempt at humor btw fyi etc)

9766 2018-11-24 18:22:58 France & Germany are raising up to protest their governments because they are run by GOLBISTS who will only care about making money from high gas prices when oil is the lowest it's been in a year and MERKEL is still trying to bring more migrants in to GERMANY!!
9767 2018-11-24 18:22:56 It was when the oil from making chips splashed my arm hella is when I knew I wanted to quit
9768 2018-11-24 18:22:45 Specifically @SCSRA, I wear beard oil and have done all of those things that McInnes hasn’t. Surely he’s just a LARPer instead of a “hipster”.

9771 2018-11-24 18:22:02 Gas prices are higher this Thanksgiving weekend than in the last 4 years. FYI it’s takes several weeks before lower oil prices reflect in gas prices.
9772 2018-11-24 18:22:02 @theresa_may so sad to see that a bloke gets murdered by the Saudi regime for oil prices to come down
9773 2018-11-24 18:21:47 Lmfaoooo fat on subs??? ARE YOU IN A PSYCH WARD? HAVE YOU NOT SEEN OIL SUBS? OHHHH WERE JUST CLUELESS ARENT WE
9774 2018-11-24 18:21:47 Yes the oil industry pushes an agenda. Scientists who publish wrong research are ridiculed and lose funding
9775 2018-11-24 18:21:37 Lmk when you want to get on SUP and talk about the economics of this and how we frame our convo to drive a truck over conservative oil drinkers.
9776 2018-11-24 18:21:33 Got my oil changed about 2,000 miles ago & my oil light came on, checked it & I have NO oil 
9777 2018-11-24 18:21:09 Thanks for the #ProTip! I'll definitely get some lens cleaner, probably less expensive than a barrel of oil, but more expensive than a gallon of gas.  Haha.  One more thing to buy and hoping to stay under budget! #PoorPeopleProblems
9778 2018-11-24 18:21:08 So I bought some psychic oil, don’t judge me, and apparently I’m allergic to it because now I have three red blotches on my forehead over my temples and third eye where it told me to apply the oil before I go to sleep 
9779 2018-11-24 18:21:02 When was the last time you've heard of "socialist big oil"?

We need #Indyref2 Now!!!!
9782 2018-11-24 18:20:33 african black soap, raw shea butter for a moisturizer and any type of oil like castor oil, lemon oil or tea tree oil will get rid of the dark spots. when my acne was really bad, i used the soap twice a day and oil only at night. and invest in a spin brush!
9783 2018-11-24 18:20:31 sauf que c est plus profond que cela le malaise date de plus longtemps  que la simple augmentation du gas oil

9786 2018-11-24 18:20:19 @tracybrabin this group have laudable aims. Includes palm oil issues and they were on your doorstep this morning? BTW I don't condone their "methodology".
9787 2018-11-24 18:20:18 The Koch's have billions.  There's more money in reliable alternative energy than there is in oil. Producing energy from the FREE to obtain sun for the masses is at a better opportunity cost than the massive cost of a  setup for traditional drilling.  Smart man still following?
9788 2018-11-24 18:20:15 DUP on mission from God., aided by blow in jive arse preacher Boris Johnson. Yeah baby the righteous cleansing of no deal  - poverty - turnips baby. Snake oil salesman who will be cushioned by his fiends in right wing English journalism.
9789 2018-11-24 18:20:14 You personally cannot get any lower.

Also... America first? You are aware you have enough oil that you don't need to buy from Saudi right?
9790 2018-11-24 18:20:08 Yeah..except global oil prices have dropped by 30%+ in the last 6+weeks.. that probably also has something to do with it..
9791 2018-11-24 18:20:05 Trump doesnt have anything to do with cutting gas prices. Gas station owners determine their own prices regardless of of oil prices. How else do u account for one station charging 3.99 per gallon and less than a block away another station its 3.07?
9792 2018-11-24 18:19:40 I was getting an oil change, & happened to come across the coach of the Hungary national men’s basketball team. Great conversation
9793 2018-11-24 18:19:38 She should visit her doctor and ask for cannabis oil  the strong stuff
9794 2018-11-24 18:19:26 It’s not entitlement—it’s valuing all human lives. That’s what a country does to be great. 

America is failing here—& falling apart under trump.

People will literally die because he can’t make money from their existence. But rich can get away with murder if they sell oil to us.
9795 2018-11-24 18:19:15 Some wars were fought for territory, some for ideology.. then some were fought for oil..

In the future it will be for water.
9796 2018-11-24 18:18:56 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
9797 2018-11-24 18:18:53 Despite talk of core inflation, the Fed has a bad history of confusing oil price spikes with general inflation.  If that bias worked in reverse, they should now reconsider their ritualistic impulse to continue hiking fed funds until the yield curve inverts.
9798 2018-11-24 18:18:52 What I'm saying is it's the free market that controls price. Speculators on wall street buy and sell depending on supply and demand. If the barrel of oil drops too low for instance, drilling will slow to a crawl or even stop drilling all together and cap wells as in the 1980's.
9799 2018-11-24 18:18:51 Idk why everyone keep letting me to get my oil changed by myself knowing i let these mfs scam me into buying extra shit 
9800 2018-11-24 18:18:49 Because Scotland doesn’t need the oil revenue and it is the only barrier to getting the desired independence. Why wouldn’t you give up something you don’t need if in return, you get what you want?
9801 2018-11-24 18:18:44 Yes, but more than that. Most Americans don't realize our large mineral & oil cos went to vulnerable countries, got them to war with each other, stole all their resources while they fought, then walked away, leaving the poisoned mess. They have the NERVE to try this with the U.S.
9802 2018-11-24 18:18:39 He already is in cahoots with Putin selling soybeans to China and cutting out American farmers.....Trump and Putin schemed many more negotiations. Oil is next!
9803 2018-11-24 18:18:36 2 hours for a darn oil change and tire rotation
9804 2018-11-24 18:18:31 Maybe don't put your eggs in one basket, if you guys diversifed your economy with all the money you made from oil then maybe this wouldn't have happened.  
9805 2018-11-24 18:18:30 PRCIE OF OIL IN THE WORLD GOING DOWN - EVERYWHERE GOING UP. WORLD MAFIA THIEVES IN BUSSINES. PRICE PAY ORIDINARY MAN LIKE ALWAYS. USA MADE ALL SHITS IN THE WORLD.

9807 2018-11-24 18:18:25 I think of all the infrastructure jobs that would be created instantly if we decided to make a real switch to renewable energy. The only losers are ultra wealthy executives of oil, coal, & gas companies. It’s like a few hundred people who’ve already amassed generations of money.
9808 2018-11-24 18:18:22 I'm assuming they mean butter for the lube. Though I wonder how olive oil would taste.
9809 2018-11-24 18:18:20 Ah, but of course it was, eh. Thankfully oil is a nice wee bonus for us to have, with our resources & talent an Independent Scotland is going to thrive with or without it.
9810 2018-11-24 18:18:18 Bring back day shift Sarah. This same old Oil is a curse rubbish. In an independent country with our own priorities, no Trident, no vanity projects,we will be fine so please worry about your own Little Engerland with Tommy and Nigel leading you to a promised land and new empire.
9811 2018-11-24 18:18:12 The mountain muse in Prestonsburg is currently one my favorite shops. Get some fresh beard oil and homemade fudge.  Gonna finish the day off with the cats and card in Whitesburg. Doing my part for shop local Saturday
9812 2018-11-24 18:18:02 Not that far from where I grew up in London as it happens. They have an IKEA and Nestle’s UK headquarters (I once did an action dressed up as an orang-utan there back in 2010 as part of the campaign to get them to ditch unsustainable palm oil).
9813 2018-11-24 18:17:56 "13 weeks of growth. I grow it out and cut it off at the end of every winter. Usually keep it trimmed. I have lost 16 lbs between pictures. Nobody can see the face gains because of the beard gains. Just used beard oil for the first time this week. Good stuff." …

9816 2018-11-24 18:17:41 oil hurts energy stocks
9817 2018-11-24 18:17:41 I think you have that backwards, they realized how effective solar panels were after they convinced us to buy them so now to keep their oil industries going they want to dim the sun so we have to rely on oil again.
9818 2018-11-24 18:17:37 nigga said motor oil I lost my shit lol
9819 2018-11-24 18:16:51 He put the oil and gas under the control of so-called state corporations. And when we speak about a state corporation, the key word here is "corporation".

Scott: “Yeah those are outrageous prices. Atleast get a better deal, I’m disappointed”
9825 2018-11-24 18:16:02 If I came on here saying and replaced the term cannabis oil for paracetamol I can guarantee you wouldn’t of tweeted me. Do you know why? Because you trust the people in white coats. You trust the government and the products they put into the pharmaceutical market.
9826 2018-11-24 18:16:02 They didn't go dark yesterday, they have always been and will continue to be a Frenemy. Like every other country. Have pride in our culture, norms, & beliefs. Don't cut off your nose...Take the low oil prices, large mil sales, and ally against Iran as the best option!

9844 2018-11-24 18:14:19 I’m concerned about how government presents these managerial economics concepts. If silo was filled with corn, we wouldn’t still apply the capacity for wheat. StatCan website is down today but 85.5% was Cdn average in Q2 2018...and children are not oil. Schools are not pipelines.
9845 2018-11-24 18:14:16 Real Madrid needs to rest abeg. They should discover their oil in peace.
9846 2018-11-24 18:14:12 Talc is not bad, it's just a mineral and it's in one of my favorite makeup setting powders, it's just like mineral oil is demonized and it's from the earth, it's harmless, I still use things with mineral oil in them too
9847 2018-11-24 18:14:09 Everything is a lie after watching this video! Motor oil is not absorbed into pancakes was enough for me
9848 2018-11-24 18:14:07 Do the auto makers in Ontario only make the most fuel efficient cars and in the most environmentally friendly way? Does Bombardier only make the most fuel efficient planes and trains? They get a free ride and even government guarantees. And they run on gas and oil.
9849 2018-11-24 18:14:03 mom prayed for me when i couldn't anointed me with olive oil.. prayed up frfrf
9850 2018-11-24 18:14:00 Nels, I thought of you today when I pulled up my New York Times and saw this article, “Palm Oil Was Supposed to Help Save the Planet. Instead It Unleashed a Catastrophe.” The destroyed rainforest is still smoking in the picture.
9851 2018-11-24 18:13:52 $10 a barrel?!?! Come on Canada!!! We produce the cleanest oil in the world!! WTH??!!!  (End of rant.)
9852 2018-11-24 18:13:48 We need an energy source to replace catbon. Fusion Thorium or Space Based Solar would do it   Electric cars don't help. Why are we not addressing this in any  substantial way?  Big Oil rocks
9853 2018-11-24 18:13:46 BITCH MOTOR OIL??? THATS THR LAST THING I EXPECTED
9854 2018-11-24 18:13:41 Same man I smoked oil
9855 2018-11-24 18:13:41 2004 me Nokia 3310 model was of 4500 Rs.... n petrol was arnd 40 Rs... so now Nokia 3310 shall be of 9000 ... what is correlation there in Grain n Fuel ... what abt consumption. We import OIL but grow grain in our land only. Gv him some lessons on basic economy
9856 2018-11-24 18:13:39 It is the speed of the rise that has angered the masses.  One year ago, diesel was around 1 euro 10 cents.  The price of oil has dropped and so people expect the price at the pump to drop.  It has affected food prices, France is a big Country and trucking is main supply method.
9857 2018-11-24 18:13:37  they used it so much, shit need an oil change
9858 2018-11-24 18:13:36 Just about every damn thing you take for granted is still dependant on oil to some extent. Did you wake up this am to see all tractor trailer trucks, construction equipment and farming equipment running on solar power?
9859 2018-11-24 18:13:35 Sorry to hear that. Hopefully your skin getting better nnt. Tp Aritu ada mua+doc kata jangan buat facial treatment within few weeks/months before wedding tau. Just continue normal routine. Perhaps awak boleh stop guna biore cleansing oil tu sbb dlm tu ada mineral oil.
9860 2018-11-24 18:13:35 I’ve had mine for just over a year, and it’s required 26 service visits.  No oil money here, just unreliable parts.

9862 2018-11-24 18:13:25 Let's break it down since I'm the daft one.  Oil is a billion dollar industry.  Providing a real alternative to Oil is a billion dollar industry.  You still with me after two sentences?  To make billions in an industry like this you need billions....still here?
9863 2018-11-24 18:13:20 If I’m being honest I smell like honey coconut body wash and olive oil sheen spray 
9864 2018-11-24 18:13:11 Since polls matters, one canadian poll shows that only 26% support an increase in oil sands output.
The interesting question is when should we act upon low polling and when should we not?
9865 2018-11-24 18:13:11 Sucks to be you, FBo. Bless. <he says during a third Chairman's pour with working toilet and oil heat>
9866 2018-11-24 18:13:07 Okay wow first they tell me not to vape at the gun range and now they’re kicking me out for drizzling all my guns with full bottles of Gun Oil sex lube. I see how it is on this bitch of an Earth.
9867 2018-11-24 18:13:03 im feeling a bit sad but then i saw this shopping network cooking rocks and even adding oil just to prove that the pan is scratch proof........ i cant stop laughing wtf goes on here

9869 2018-11-24 18:12:55 That is treating the "symptom" we need to stop the cause ASAP. 
That is all the emissions, fuel sources, and a carbon tax would be very effective reigning in the corporate oil & coal greed.
9870 2018-11-24 18:12:52 Not everyday a person gets blocked by their PM.

Unless you work in the Albertan Oil Industry. #cdnpoli
9871 2018-11-24 18:12:49 @Dove I've been told you use unsustainable palm oil in your soap. Please tell me that's not true as I yse your soap daily
9872 2018-11-24 18:12:49 As if big oil has ever cared about people's jobs. It's only ever been about exploitation of countries and desolation of the environment.
9873 2018-11-24 18:12:49 @VinnieTortorich probably 2 clicks behind on this subject but I saw a product being pushed at my local grocery store it was algae oil toting less sat fat than olive oil what's the scoop

9875 2018-11-24 18:12:39 If Black Friday lowered the oil prices.... God help us in Christmas sales 
9876 2018-11-24 18:12:37 Feeling intensely the connection between the brutal #SaudiArabia murder of #Khashoggi and its Trumpian excuses as a personal, flailing yet totalitarian defense of oil extraction cyclically funding arms deals & capitalist expansion that is killing workers and the world.
9877 2018-11-24 18:12:20 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.
9878 2018-11-24 18:12:17 You idiot......oil & gas exploration & production is how we make a living!!  Oil is not used for gasoline only. It takes oil to make many other products we need, like plastics, tires, fuel oil in NE, etc. 
What a bobble head!
9879 2018-11-24 18:12:10 Let's refuse to accept any more climate change denialists instead of rejecting immigrants. They are scapegoats for your oil & gas buddies who want to see us burn fossil fuels until there are no more. By then, most of the planet will be dead.
9880 2018-11-24 18:12:05 What is it about the weekend after Thanksgiving that every human being in the free world wants an oil change?
9881 2018-11-24 18:11:58 43 people like it now that might know @realDonaldTrump is all about himself.  Keep watching check out that stock market. Bringing in cheap gas from Saudi making  Oil companies lose more money due to competition. Making the government lose money as well. Guy is a moron! 
9882 2018-11-24 18:11:57 Even apart from the environmental impact it never seems to dawn on those people oil and coal are FINITE RESOURCES.  Sooner or later they're gonna run out anyway!
9883 2018-11-24 18:11:50 The goal I would have for myself is to eventually reduce the opioid meds, as a result of bringing inflammation down in my body.  I would most likely continue the RSO CBD oil until all pain was gone.

9885 2018-11-24 18:11:35 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
9886 2018-11-24 18:11:35 MACs paint pot!!! It’s not necessarily a primer but it makes ur eye shadow not crease and stay put bc it’s matte and gets rid of the oil 
9887 2018-11-24 18:11:30 !!!! Listen! I just want a full service oil change in this huge ass car lmao
9888 2018-11-24 18:11:22 I had the oil changed on 3 of my cars, 2 of them detailed, tint removed and replaced on another all before noon.

9893 2018-11-24 18:10:49 口が悪くて好き
9894 2018-11-24 18:10:44 Because somebody has to, and we'd rather pretend we can burn coal and oil forever. 
9895 2018-11-24 18:10:30 I am in a math mood today for some reason...

A = 10 years before we are met with irreversible Catastrophic weather events.

B = Low Oil Prices.

C = Choice

Therefore...

B + C = A

C + A = B
9896 2018-11-24 18:10:27 What you don’t put motor oil on your pancakes !?!?!
9897 2018-11-24 18:10:23 Coconut oil is an exception of a healthy saturated fat to consume. These have 3 ingredients: sweet potatoes, organic coconut oil and sea salt. Occ I need something with crunch other than celery 
9898 2018-11-24 18:10:17 Everyone is unique.

If I had debilitating pain, the FIRST thing I would want is opioid pain meds and CBD oil, the kind that is like black tar, that is very potent.

The next thing I would do is go on an intense long term organic juicing/herb program to reduce inflammatory pain
9899 2018-11-24 18:10:03 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
9900 2018-11-24 18:10:02 do you,, need more olive oil?
9901 2018-11-24 18:09:58 Video who could be so stupid... it is call supply and demand... oil is in abundance therefore the price is low #SMH
9902 2018-11-24 18:09:55 Aha that’s real crazy I mean I knew they use like wax and stuff but not shaving scream and oil 
9903 2018-11-24 18:09:50 — Skip the lotion and use an ointment or cream. Lotions can be more irritating and less effective than ointments and creams for dry skin. When selecting a cream or ointment, look for one that contains an oil such as olive oil or jojoba oil, or one with shea butter.
9904 2018-11-24 18:09:39 no this man drank all my olive oil
9905 2018-11-24 18:09:38 My wife has chronic pain (back and knees) . She recently started using CBD oil and says it does help. Usually, when she takes it, she does have as much pain medication.

YMMV.
9906 2018-11-24 18:09:28 ‘...when you point the finger at someone else, there are three fingers pointing back at you.’ This is supposed to be serious analysis? You ignore the significant influence of foreign money to kill the oil sands. If PMJT really cared he could use the Notwithstanding clause.
9907 2018-11-24 18:09:16 Yes, oil mill market, eche market

9909 2018-11-24 18:09:09 Harvard & Yale, are looking for big money from the oil industry, good idea for oil stop solar panels from working.
9910 2018-11-24 18:08:58 A bail in would be like pouring oil onto Bitcoin’s adoption flames showing all the nocoiners/haters instantly the worth of an unconfiscatable sound money banks can‘t steal from you.

We‘ll see... some day... not hoping though.
9911 2018-11-24 18:08:58 Well well yup this is Alberta for you. No class never did. I lived there and let me tell you. They are the most rude ignorant people around. If your not in oil they look down to you and treat ppl like garbage.
9912 2018-11-24 18:08:43 @Tastealotta Thank you for picking out the perfect pairings of oil & vinegar. #SmallBusinessSaturday #shopsmall
9913 2018-11-24 18:08:43 Why have I been at pep boys over 2 hours for an oil change? I’m confused
9914 2018-11-24 18:08:34 no kiddin, gonna do some heavy maintenance (oil change, low end alignment,bearings, joints) you know regular stuff to get bowl ready.
9915 2018-11-24 18:08:25 Idk why i thought coming to get my oil changed on my break was a good idea..  1 hour later
9916 2018-11-24 18:08:22 100% agree...my mechanic stopped her Saturday hours and I’m in desperate need of an oil change and other junk but matt isn’t up to getting under the car. We should have been auto mechanics, gurl...we could have had it all
9917 2018-11-24 18:08:21 Oh they'll call them out now.......until they need their oil and pipeline. 
9918 2018-11-24 18:08:12 U.K. GOV THINKS IT CAN ABUSE SCOTLAND AND STEAL ITS OIL, DO WHATS RIGHT AND VETO THE DEAL ON CONDITION SCOTLAND GOES INDEPENDENT OR DEVOLVED NATIONS LEADERS SITS AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE IN FUTURE!

9923 2018-11-24 18:08:01 He only likes Diet Coke , and you can’t find it in Venezuela , you that country is part of the world , they have unlimited wealth thru their oil reserves , and yet you go to their Supermarkets and you can’t find toilet paper , the same with India , Pakistan , Cuba, NK,And S Afric
9924 2018-11-24 18:07:47 Same,I use jojoba oil
9925 2018-11-24 18:07:41 @Acosta you better watch out. Murdering American journalists is ok with @realDonaldTrump. Especially if we can get “cheap oil prices”. Republicans don’t want Americans to use solar energy because the sun doesn’t work for money! We all get our fair share of the sun daily. #solar
9926 2018-11-24 18:07:28 Having worked in head office for an oil major I can assure you that the oil price is the number one consideration.
9927 2018-11-24 18:07:09 The climate change deniers all have the same story. Sad that they are doing the bidding of big oil to the detriment of humanity. "No scientific evidence" means "none that I accept, because it conflicts with my beliefs". Anthropogenic climate change is a fact.
9928 2018-11-24 18:07:02 See this Thread 
And remember Dossier 80-90%true
12-7-16 Putin ships 19.5% Rosneft oil shares to shell n Singapore into Shell
Controlled by Stephen Schwarzman Trump’s best pal
Putin lies says 1/2 Qatar 1/2 Glencore 
Schwarzman Qatar control Glencore 
Trump Schwarzman got 4.5% oil
9929 2018-11-24 18:06:51 The 4th one is quality...  If that’s what the @metpoliceuk are doing for their 9-5... Sign me up! No more oil industry for me. I’m going out ramming scooter criminals 
9930 2018-11-24 18:06:50 No, you tried to portray me against all those things. I didn’t say or do anything. I was talking about oil in Canada.
9931 2018-11-24 18:06:47 We don't need middle east oil now, we are producing more of our own.
9932 2018-11-24 18:06:45 Paralyzed and crippled and disfigured at best and still those who touched down off of Abe's jet liner still were irritated that quarter Japanese wasn't good enough and yet the five chevron oil engineering students put it: I didn't think and yet they locked horns with the one
9933 2018-11-24 18:06:42 I'm done with sugar and oil for at least a week 
9934 2018-11-24 18:06:41 Do I want to go out and get hair lotion and oil for my bald head or just stay here at my desk and eat my left over breakfast sandwich? 
9935 2018-11-24 18:06:32 As I have told day shift Sarah Oil Price is way down the priority list. For a billion dollar project the main thing is stability of region, infrastructure available, rig design and partnerships with other investors. It is very rare for an oil major to wholly own an asset.
9936 2018-11-24 18:06:31 Ya I work in our oil industry in SA... PetroSA don’t pay, Sapref ran out of money this year!!! I mean... it’s a war torn country... who got that Brown Envelope @CyrilRamaphosa ??
9937 2018-11-24 18:06:13 *Overheard on the TTC this morning

Old white MAGA male: The people are pretty nice, but their politics are weird. They've got a kid as Prime Minister and they won't sell oil to the US. They have to sell it for a loss here. He's in bed with the environmentalists. #what #fakenews
9938 2018-11-24 18:05:56 I would say in the tray it'll help steam it too oil is absorbed water likely to evaporate
9939 2018-11-24 18:05:51 Nigga was shadowboxing with a lit oil barrel with all the tunes
9940 2018-11-24 18:05:45 No now the is disingenuous - Norway has different fields at different stages of maturity. I am taking you up on your original assertions which you are ducking - at what price do new North Sea Oil fields become economic ? simple question ?
9941 2018-11-24 18:05:38 If the Saudi prince buys united or even SPURS, you'd suddenly see skysports and Talksport having polls on how oil money is destroying competitive football, solely because it would hamper city
9942 2018-11-24 18:05:18 11/24 Stocks down 3.0% last week after down 8% during 10/18.    Europe, China and and Interest rates were lower.  Gold was higher.  Oil tanked.  With lower inflation, Fed may hold on interest rate increase.  . Cryptocurrencies tanked and VIX (investor concern) was higher
9943 2018-11-24 18:05:11 What if gas is $4/gj and your “oil well” produces 18,000 scf/bbl GOR?
9944 2018-11-24 18:05:03 Your lies have been revealed, your phony Paris Agreement is flypaper, Texas alone is bringing millions of barrels of new oil onto the market, China and India are bringing vast coal capacity online...

It's over, bro. You lost. Good thing you were wrong.
9945 2018-11-24 18:05:01 Fuck. My oil change light just came on.
9946 2018-11-24 18:04:58 All Saudi Oil money.  These thiefs need to go!
9947 2018-11-24 18:04:53 I think we've had just about enough of the myth that labourers in the oil and gas industry support all of Canada. The entire energy sector, upstream and downstream, doesn't budge ten percent of GDP. Hydro, coal, the whole shebang.
9948 2018-11-24 18:04:48 Nice spin. I did not ask about Saudi oil, I asked about the humanitarian crisis the Saudis and Americans created in Yemen. Now will you answer the question?
9949 2018-11-24 18:04:44 Mix sugar, lemon juice, and tea tree oil. Use it as a scrub everyday
9950 2018-11-24 18:04:43 I hate kids yo. I reiterate this as I get my oil changed and SOME FUCKING KID IS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS AND BEING A LITTLE SHIT!!!!!! #FuckHerMotherToo #NotLiterally #FatBish
9951 2018-11-24 18:04:35 There goes oil prices, oh well it was nice knowing you...this event will spiral around Europe for high oil prices and the US soon, don't be surprised.
9952 2018-11-24 18:04:35 So why not forego the oil revenue if the country doesn’t need it and it is the only barrier to Independence?
9953 2018-11-24 18:04:32 How about rich CA celebrities give  up their mansions, Silicon Valley, yachts &GAS guzzling SUV’s, close down huge sports stadiums & super malls. 
Hollywood could stop making movies, CD’s made in China oil producing factories then shipped around world in oil fueld planes & ships
9954 2018-11-24 18:04:10 Are Fuel companies in the UK Still waiting for the media to report the price of oil ???
Before they start to reduce the price at the pump !!!
They did not need any help to increase the price as oil ticked up.
Shame on you fat Cat profiteering no marks .
9955 2018-11-24 18:04:09 Wood was quoting combination of R/P ratio based on economic extraction to lobby for lower taxes. 

The drastic reduction in costs to produce and favourable tax rates has thrown the oil industry a lifeline.

Good news for jobs but a long way off enough tax to cover the deficit.
9956 2018-11-24 18:04:09 C'mere lemme pour some coconut oil on it.
9957 2018-11-24 18:04:08 Economic Turmoil Could Send Oil Even Lower
 
"A breakthrough in negotiations would provide a lift to global financials, but a deepening of the conflict could drag down the global economy further, already reeling from slow growth and the latest bout of volatility..."
9958 2018-11-24 18:04:05 Hahaha. We know this is not true because Trump did not cut gas prices. The oil companies did.
9959 2018-11-24 18:04:03 I wouldn’t even bother engaging with Blair he’s one of the ones during referendum for independence who laughed at nats who were saying they were hiding the fact Clair Ridge was Oil rich. Apparently Cameron was just up looking at Shetland ponies!
9960 2018-11-24 18:03:59 My dads so sweet he’s like no seas mensa y dejes que le hagan algo más al carro solo vas por  un oil change  nada más 
9961 2018-11-24 18:03:56 so happy i finally received my cbd oil. mary jane is soulful. 
9962 2018-11-24 18:03:44 From what has been already destroyed for meat nobody have a second thought. They will continue to destroy it for meat and part of it for Palm oil. Go vegan and don't eat products with Palm oil in it.
9963 2018-11-24 18:03:34 You can always boycott all oil and oil based products...try it and let me know how it works out
9964 2018-11-24 18:03:27 This is the oil industry, scary if you  ask me
9965 2018-11-24 18:03:21 Low oil prices are nice. But why praise Saudi Arabia for it? Sorry. Does not even make sense. One reason is that Trump allows Iran to sell oil again.
9966 2018-11-24 18:03:20 Let’s get this bread and olive oil...seriously tho I’m craving bread with olive oil.
9967 2018-11-24 18:03:11 By age 29 I had started my oil company. In the 8th grade my dream was to go to OU / get a degree in Petroleum Engineering/ work for a major company learn all I could about operations then start buying oil wells. I used $ I made in the stock market as a down payment. No parent $
9968 2018-11-24 18:03:07 It's pretty simple, leave some of the oil in the ground for future generations.
9969 2018-11-24 18:03:01 Halliburton from $30 to $0.6 ...expect the same with other oil exploration peers
9970 2018-11-24 18:02:48 It's just a bud covered in oil covered in keef. It shouldn't be hard to make. I already have all the ingredients 
You don't even have legal medical cannabis there? #legalizeit
9971 2018-11-24 18:02:47 i’m livid.... three nights at my grammas using bar soap and expired barely decipherable tubs of lotion has done more for my skin than weeks of my tea tree oil ass bentonite clay ass thayers witch hazel ass skincare routine
9972 2018-11-24 18:02:38 And how is Trump responsible for the price of oil? I can't think of any way accept if you want to give him sole credit for the stock market collapsing and demand not reaching supply.
9973 2018-11-24 18:02:34 I've only ever baked wee squash whole, then you slice open and deseed. Yerrah roast them in oil with plenty of salt !!
9974 2018-11-24 18:02:27 No normal governments control trade through tariffs and countermeasures. When they was no control and anyone could import fuel it was at 80 cents and yet those days oil per barrel was at its highest. If the 1.40 being charged now was real our fuel will be most expensive in region
9975 2018-11-24 18:02:26 Nobody cares about pipelines because I'm not in the oil industry. I care about the Canada Post strike because I own a company that ships thousands of items through them. 

Maybe, we can care about both for the betterment of the economy.
9976 2018-11-24 18:02:26 My car still burns gasoline along with 98% of the cars in the world. The move to green energy is a long term process not an event.

Might as well use  oil instead of oil from Middle East Dictatorships and Kingdoms with no human rights during the transition. 
#Cdnpoli
9977 2018-11-24 18:02:20 @realDonaldTrump I hope the Treasury Department and Iran's action group feel Responsibility and respect for the free people of Iran is unimpaired, the full implementation of these sanctions is very important, especially the full implementation of the sanctions on oil.
9978 2018-11-24 18:02:12 Oh yeah, that's about as consistent as oil and water. Phase 3's solo movies took almost every bit of development from previous films or indeed from within the same films and bent it off in a different direction. The only consistent character was Doctor Strange.
9979 2018-11-24 18:02:08 Also OSU Bruhz oil slap #GoBlue
9980 2018-11-24 18:01:40 Alright, we gotta talk @PozitivSaiyan It's Grease. Like the oil...because his motif is a robot.
9981 2018-11-24 18:01:34 nope that's straight into the dish with the pumpkin, @protip add a glug of oil to the water and make sure you shake it round!
9982 2018-11-24 18:01:32 Hey @CTVNews on late night Nov 23 news u had a story about pipelines and moving more oil via rail with a vid of railway rank cars going by. Just to let you know those tanks contain Canola Oil not petroleum products. Lets get it right
9983 2018-11-24 18:01:32 Only thing to say to insurance companies suggesting fundraising for your own heart transplant is - what the fuck is wrong with you and, more than that, what the fuck is wrong with this country?  Oil subsidies but no healthcare for all! America at its finest.

9987 2018-11-24 18:01:17 i need a oil change too, on you ??
9988 2018-11-24 18:01:16 Canceling Northern Gate Way was stupid decision, though it was deliberately made to destroy Alberta’s oil sand projects. This government should be prosecuted for that stupid decision.
9989 2018-11-24 18:01:12 This why I don’t like getting an oil change! I don’t care what else is wrong with this car! Give me my oil change and let me go!

Day 9: 90-Day Challenge 
Worked a 8hr RN shift yesterday.
This is where my "break-in tolerence" is limited to.

Headed home where an epsom salt ,  Motrin/CBD oil, &  hemp compressions awaited before

9991 2018-11-24 18:01:03 1) There are 2 main types of inflation: Cost push inflation and monetary velocity inflation. In the '70s, the huge rates of inflation were a combination of both. The oil embargo by OPEC caused input costs for goods to climb rapidly, which companies then passed on to consumers.
9992 2018-11-24 18:00:51 A DIL with weed oil is a friend indeed.
9993 2018-11-24 18:00:48 “Oil Company” , oh you sell groundnut oil and palm oil 
9994 2018-11-24 18:00:43 Lead by example. Boycott anything hat uses oil and oil based products...good luck!!!!

9996 2018-11-24 18:00:29 I don't recall his saying, or my thinking, that we were out of oil. Merely that the planet has a finite amount of oil. My take at the time was that we should save ours for emergencies, and use foreign oil as much as possible. Now, we realize how bad for the planet any oil is.

9999 2018-11-24 18:00:24 I would happily help you with your engine but I am under contract. I work in the oil industry and I will get sued if I worked on unauthorized projects outside of my contractual jurisdiction.
10000 2018-11-24 18:00:16 Vile decision making Iko down wallahi Niko sure inakaribia ku-discover oil
10001 2018-11-24 18:00:16 But oil prices and gasoline on markets have crashed but prices in Calgary are still high which is caused by foreign oil companies being greedy and screwing us!!!!!!!

10003 2018-11-24 18:00:08 Until the shale revolution, the assumption was that being the "ethical oil" supplier to the US was a wonderful situation to be in. Until it wasn't.

10005 2018-11-24 18:00:06 She isn't gone yet and if you think this will be a cake walk for Kenney becareful.
The left isn't going to give up control of Alberta's oil reserves without a mega fight using every dirty trick in the book.
10006 2018-11-24 18:00:04 I remember calling Blair MCDougall a fat ride for thinking that we were all buttoned up the back that Cameron went up to look at Shetland ponies and not the Oil at Clair ridge...
They then said what if Shetland Islands ask for independence from Scotland...? As a counter argument
10007 2018-11-24 17:59:56 Here’s the irony you yourself said as result of show down russia would run out of money but instead non oil exports in some sectors are booming and reserves recovered $150bn of cash while several non oil sectors at post soviet highs. Like @HenryJFoy said sanctions have failed
10008 2018-11-24 17:59:53 Came to get my  cars oil change without  my padre   #adulting
10009 2018-11-24 17:59:46 11/27 - Reduce "Short" positions in stocks  Stock negatives are moving averages, wealth index, & investor confidence.  BUT technical positives are near long-term support, very oversold condition.  Also Economy is strong.   Oil price decline - Fed may delay interest rates hikes.
10010 2018-11-24 17:59:40 Trudeau won't win again if this problem isn't addressed, pot is legal now so his job is finished. When oil losses start showing up on the feds books cons will have plenty of ammo to sink libs.
10011 2018-11-24 17:59:39 brought my pup with me to get my oil changed and I have NEVER heard so many grown men baby talk to a dog at once 
10012 2018-11-24 17:59:07 Authentic guacamole is made by mashing an avocado with coriander and salt. Adding olive oil is usually unnecessary and good Mexican restaurants would never add raw garlic as it overpowers the creaminess and sticks to the palette.

10014 2018-11-24 17:58:58 A wall you'll need to get periodic oil changes for.
10015 2018-11-24 17:58:54 Came to get an oil change with drying lotion on my face...someone shoot me DeAD!!!!

-coconut oil is extremely moisturizing and contains vitamin E and antioxidant. Before going to bed Apply extra virgin all oil to your under eyes and leave it overnight.
10017 2018-11-24 17:58:44 Myself and other farmers are part of this story. (Abbey resources) To be clear this is not an anti oil and gas development story it is a government regulation failure story by all political stripes @trevortombe @andrew_leach
10018 2018-11-24 17:58:34 I think the current fall in oil is not akin to the 2014 plunge which lasted until February 2016 but rather akin to the mid recession plunge we had in 2008 (straight down without relief rally).A severe global recession already stealthily began in Q3/Q4 and will wreak havok in 2019
10019 2018-11-24 17:58:32 Chelsea drinking oil!!
10020 2018-11-24 17:58:28 Looking to potentially swing long a couple oil contracts at these levels. Maybe a multi month hold. Let’s see how daily bars look next week
