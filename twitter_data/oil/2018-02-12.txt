53 2018-02-12 23:54:09 1/ We can't just turn off the switch though. The "no more oil NOW" mentality is doesn't work. The current government took over from a party that was in power for 44 years, and did NOTHING to try to diversify the economy. The NDP are trying, but it is not an overnight event. In

59 2018-02-12 23:53:43 Clearly do not pay attention to how oil works. If you did you would know oil started recovering due to opec unifying to drop production. There are other things happening there that if you paid attention you would know instead of pointing fingers in the dark. I'm glad oil's cheap.

64 2018-02-12 23:52:47 The nip+fab glycolic acid pads are the ones I use but if you want a cheaper version you could get the ordinary 7% glycolic acid toning solution, any brand of tea tree oil is sort of the same and only use the acid at night if u do get it because it makes ur skin sensitive to light

66 2018-02-12 23:52:11 They wouldn’t spend on teachers and education at 2%, hence the current problem. Pass this and you are giving up the leverage to get teacher raises and increased classroom funding which is still available 7%. Oil and gas knows it supported by OK voters at 67%.

69 2018-02-12 23:51:59 The Alberta NDP is not like the BC NDP, nor is it like the federal NDP. It truly is more centerist. I think BC was listening to the PC cries of "Notley hates oil" and not paying attention to what she was doing, and panicked when the pipelines got approved.
70 2018-02-12 23:51:59 Pretty similar minus ours being oil filled.
71 2018-02-12 23:51:53 I'm becoming a cautious convert to the idea. done right it could work. save a fortune on all the costs of means testing etc. We could have done it with an oil fund if we'd thought like Norway back in the day.
72 2018-02-12 23:51:46 Hmm. My Jif says peanuts, sugar, vegetable oil, and salt. (And the sugar amt is very low)

100 2018-02-12 23:47:25 I heard it's because a lot of guys colognes have oil in it making it last longer. I think a lot of perfumes have alcohol in it and that doesn't last long. I know for sure that's why those mist sprays from Bath and Body Works don't last long. So look for oil as and ingredient!

118 2018-02-12 23:44:12 Does Arnica oil do better for pain than the arnica gel? What percent arnica does your oil have in it? My Arnicare gel has Arnica montana 1X HPUS-7%, whatever that means. My Arnicare sublingual tablets have Arnica montana 9C HPUS. I don't know what that means either. lol

157 2018-02-12 23:39:43 When the earth’s forests died and its lakes stagnated, the insects adapted camouflage to match their new environment-steel and glass. Those proboscis can pierce through robotic limbs to get at the oil and synthetics. Who’d’ve thought mosquitoes would be a human AND bot problem?

166 2018-02-12 23:38:25 Had a crap day today so I'm basting myself in coconut oil; back at you in the morning when I am shiny and new and smell like a piña colada
167 2018-02-12 23:38:12 Harder to find around me, but yes. I stick to my jojoba and grapeseed oil for these times.
168 2018-02-12 23:38:10 Changed my oil, cleaned my car, got a car wash, got groceries, and now ima study. Todayyssss a good day 
169 2018-02-12 23:38:07 His boss is most certainly quite Clueless. In Tillerson's case it is a sort of cynicism born of decades in the oil industry and general nonchalance about Middle Eastern affairs. He has more then enough to worry about domestically
170 2018-02-12 23:38:07 You guys no joke i was beyond stressed out an hour ago with a mild headache and seriously felt like passing out and i turned on my diffuser and but an essential oil blend on and i feel so much better like I’m not crazy
171 2018-02-12 23:38:07 I would suspect the sludge, more. Only freaked out once it was properly warm. Might need to run thicker oil for a whole until I can do a rebuild.
172 2018-02-12 23:38:04 It’s already flooded

174 2018-02-12 23:37:44 Today was such a good day guys i made peach oil in lab and the TA was so happy with the outcome he asked to keep it i was all mmm regrade my prelab then.. lol
175 2018-02-12 23:37:35 My hair color might be blonde but I’m not dumb I know I don’t need the to pay almost $80 to get my oil changed.
176 2018-02-12 23:37:08 And in the Middle East.  Paid how much to speak? Did he ask them what their country was doing to help the climate. Are they giving up oil ?and worried about their carbon footprint?If he had a brain he might be dangerous
177 2018-02-12 23:37:04 Trudeau and Notley will make sure we aren't producing any oil, so that may happen, regardless!
178 2018-02-12 23:37:02 That fretboard is looking a bit dry. Needs a bit of linseed oil or rock sweat!

180 2018-02-12 23:36:43 She’s even MORE corrupt & uses her marriage to him as a cover. Her family is heavily into Chinese shipping & China needs oil. Throw in the situation in Venezuela & just wait & see where their oil ends up. Caveat is transporting it: Panama Canal or go all the way around SAmer?
181 2018-02-12 23:36:39 I never said they lied... only that you lied. I said listing donations to representatives from oil and gas companies is EXACTLY why they removed her. The reason they gave was making "personal comments." This isn't a difficult concept to grasp.
182 2018-02-12 23:36:28 The pipeline is an act on BCs tourist driven economy...  Ecotourism brings in millions which is threatened by the prospect of an oil spill.
183 2018-02-12 23:36:23 Oil demand still going up, if we don't the saudis, Venezuelans or Qatar will, we can afford social programs in part because our oil
184 2018-02-12 23:36:23 Put coconut oil on them every night! And take the biotin vitamin!
185 2018-02-12 23:36:07 Just watched a Leykis video on this lol. You’re hot and pretty? Better lock a man down abd tradthot your way through life. Oh you’re a fat disgusting beast? Whelp better learn accounting and how to change your own oil.
186 2018-02-12 23:36:06 Just spent 30 minutes detangling my hair and applying an oil bath, have a bonnet on and now off to sleep I guess

188 2018-02-12 23:35:51 So dangerous! Maybe we should just keep trucking and using rail...either way, the oil is crossing BC. AB is simply losing money due to lack of pipelines
189 2018-02-12 23:35:39 That are now shipping the oil & gas to overseas markets...

192 2018-02-12 23:35:15 They need to hurry up and do my damn oil change
193 2018-02-12 23:35:14 Thatcher acted out of ideological spite, & her govt squandered NS oil revenues to place 000s onto the scrap heap. Other countries did things differently & remade modern diverse economies. Her brexit heirs are finishing the job but the carnage will be indiscriminate this time.
194 2018-02-12 23:35:09 Today I cut an avocado in half, then I sprayed some coconut oil (Trader Joe’s makes it) on the side with the pit and stuck it in the fridge, in a container...it stayed green!! The coconut oil hardened from the cold and sealed the half.
195 2018-02-12 23:35:00 Yeah that curly cream is pretty good, jbco is a good Oil but it's really thick so be careful not to use too much!
196 2018-02-12 23:34:58 I was and still am totally against the war in Afghanistan, we had no reason to be there. That was Bush, Oil, and Nation Building....no plan or exit strategy to this day!
197 2018-02-12 23:34:50 There is a little bit of olive oil there since I used it to cook the egg. Sadly I don't have a array of cheeses at home. Lol.
198 2018-02-12 23:34:49 Wind pays 5x the amount big oil pays.

200 2018-02-12 23:34:45 Last week's budget bill delivered a 250% increase in tax credits for #CCUS and enhanced oil recovery. Bipartisan effort with the support of the big unions and very very little resistance. #EOR #45Q #CCS

205 2018-02-12 23:34:08 Krill Oil is the bane of my existence. I do BJJ 3-4 times a week and get choked out a lot bc I'm really bad. Without it my neck would be sore 24/7. Jocko Joint warfare is my favorite kind.
206 2018-02-12 23:34:07 I need to wash my hair but I'm lacking oil so ...
207 2018-02-12 23:33:59 Phase out coal over 20 yrs. Replace with natural gas. But above all, don't try to lead the global parade toward a fake goal (Paris) when (1) you export oil and (2) your emissions are just 1.5% of the global total. Only lefty ideologues who don't care about workers would do that.
208 2018-02-12 23:33:51 Just passed the spot where we broke down during our last attempt to attend this appointment in town.
Had a good chuckle at the bloody great oil spot on the road.

212 2018-02-12 23:33:28 Colton Kehler (25 & 26) and Brendan Semchuk (12) score in the 2nd for the Oil Kings. They lead the Blazers 3-1. Shots 22-17 Kamloops. PPs Edm 1/1 Kam 0/1. Stripes getting booed off the ice after 40 minutes.
213 2018-02-12 23:33:25 I stopped plucking and shaping my eyebrows a few months ago to encourage hair growth (with use of castor oil) and now theyve grown in so beautifully all i have to do is fill them in with a bit of boy brow and i couldnt be more pleased anyway lol thanks for tuning in

216 2018-02-12 23:33:11 IFO the tiny island country of Tokelau’s electricity is generated entirely by solar power. However, when it is overcast outside, the island runs on generators powered by coconut oil.
217 2018-02-12 23:33:10 Oil Kings getting benefit of video replay... they score three in the period (two 22 seconds apart after review) to go up 3-1 after two periods. Fans getting to a boiling point.  Shots 22-17 KAM
218 2018-02-12 23:33:09 @GloriaBorger Pence is a greater danger to the nation, democracy, the rule of law, and regular order. Because Pence knows where the oil that greases government is stored and who has keys or where the keys are kept when not used. Pence keeps his tribal instincts hidden well.
219 2018-02-12 23:33:08 Not like u to run outa oil 
220 2018-02-12 23:33:04 Awoke to a cold bedroom this AM
Furnace out. $8-10k to get one instead of the oil kind. WELL.
221 2018-02-12 23:32:53 Trust me I would love to love in a world that doesn’t rely on fossil fuels but how do we get there? Even plastics need oil. It’s a long way away.

223 2018-02-12 23:32:30 boston dynamics robots don’t scare me, they’re basically just complicated remote control cars and for all the advancedness they still sound like fuckin robocop every time they move, is servo oil expensive or something

227 2018-02-12 23:32:21 Trump's far right 'fans' couldn't tell the difference between a 4th grader Crayola drawing and an oil by an accomplished artist. Or understand what a painting depicts. 
228 2018-02-12 23:32:18 Jist like theirs no oil left while building hotels over the west coast of Scotland
229 2018-02-12 23:32:17 لا مش نفسي ...
230 2018-02-12 23:32:14 And less moral, Also remember that California and Venezuela are heavy oil like Alberta as well.
231 2018-02-12 23:31:55 Oil ain't going away anytime soon, if we don't the saudis, Venezuela or Qatar will.
232 2018-02-12 23:31:37 People really don’t know you’re supposed to put oil on your skin before jouvert so the paint washes off easily? Yikes
233 2018-02-12 23:31:30 Get the oil change and oil change ONLY!
234 2018-02-12 23:31:11 Have them drawn and quartered by rabbits. Then burn the remains with holy oil.

237 2018-02-12 23:30:59 It’s a give and take my friend. Plus side, You can start training to enter in curling for the next Olympics. As for the cats, it can take awhile for them to acclimate to change, but maybe they don’t like the oil you chose. Important question. Did you use lavender?
238 2018-02-12 23:30:58 It's an obvious choice when you consider #LNP
-Supports ideas via substandard NBN
-Is unable to negotiate
-Has cut foreign aid, incr' poverty& uprisings
-They claim to support Paris agreement, yet spend $B's waging war over oil& gas resources.
-Is incompetent,corrupt&bloodthirsty
239 2018-02-12 23:30:54 FWIW Daniel 11:40 has King of the North(European power-the Beast) attacking King of the South(Caliphate?)after KOS "pushes at him"(oil embargo?).
The final battle at Armageddon probably Europe vs Kings of the East-Rev 16:12,16 from Russia/China. I don't see Russia/Islam alliance

242 2018-02-12 23:30:39 Ugh we have oil heat lol it’s the worst.
243 2018-02-12 23:30:33 10 years ago - before the oil boom there - I flew into Williston, North Dakota for a deposition, walked out of the airport & about 200 yards to the hotel. The double doors were open; inside the desk clerk said, "Beautiful day, isn't it?!" It was 40 degrees w 30 mph constant winds
244 2018-02-12 23:30:29 OIL
245 2018-02-12 23:30:23 OIL DIFF: 3.37 -> 3.45
246 2018-02-12 23:30:21 I’m getting my oil changed & I can just tell the people working on my car are judging the fuck out of all the crap I have inside my car
247 2018-02-12 23:30:20 Bulk of US power projection was not and is not about securing oil supplies so that they can make it to US markets. Your presumption was wrong, that is why things are not making sense to you.
248 2018-02-12 23:30:12 & that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
249 2018-02-12 23:30:00 Bet I’ll bang off limiter and throw a rod then use the oil as drift lube

254 2018-02-12 23:29:17 If he spends enough that the USD falls sharply, "flyover country" will do quite well.  The USD "collapsed" v. oil from 2005-2008, & that USD "collapse" worked out quite well for "flyover country", no?
255 2018-02-12 23:29:13 Fish oil helped our Lab’s dandruff tremendously.  And seemed to help her sensitive skin.

260 2018-02-12 23:28:18 Oil receives 8 Billion dollars in Subsides from the federal government. By contrast all of public education received only 2 Billion. Sounds like we know who is stealing from the rich, and it isn’t electric car companies.

263 2018-02-12 23:28:08 I spent a considerable portion of today working outdoors. It was -51 with the wind chill. Stay in school kids, the oil patch isn't for the faint of heart. Or milennials!

265 2018-02-12 23:28:05 What and why is the alliance with Isreal so strong? I've always wondered. They have no oil in yhe middle east. We fund them on everything.
Exacty, what is there groas national product.....God?
266 2018-02-12 23:28:03 That‘s utterly bizarre! And surprisingly eloquent and unaggressive for a flat earther. It‘s the latest snake oil thing: Flatten your mind and happiness will follow

274 2018-02-12 23:27:26 The day you start noticing your oil looks alittle milky is the day you start counting down the days of your engine, the yoters life is limited  its only a matter of miles
275 2018-02-12 23:27:17 She is right. The petro chemical industry is raping the ordinary Americans. The politicians pockets are well lined. Why is oil prices going up? It started after Trump's visit to Saudia Arabia.
276 2018-02-12 23:27:00 Ooooh who did she murder? Was it Kevin? It looks like she killed him for interrupting her accounting session. Then she has the cheek to sit and pose for a oil painting at the crime scene.

287 2018-02-12 23:25:37 Wrong. These figures have been grossly over exaggerated. Most investments in the Middle East are for oil exploration and development, of which American companies have benefited greatly.
288 2018-02-12 23:25:24 It is the world's 12th largest oil company by production, standing at 3.1 million barrels per day

297 2018-02-12 23:24:07 And now. H.B.4268. JUST PASSED HOUSE. CONGRESS GIVES OIL AND GAS COMPANIES RIGHTS TO DRILL ON YOUR LAND,  WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION OR KNOWLEDGE OR COMPENSATION. I THOUGHT TRUMP DRAINED THE SWAMP? ALL YES VOTES BY CONGRESSMAN WHO GOT BRIBES
298 2018-02-12 23:23:44 Can’t you get McKenna back on your show to explain how women in community’s close to the oil field need protection from men. Don don. You’re becoming more pathetic as is your opinion
299 2018-02-12 23:23:38 Alberta stopping import of BC wine and energy is frankly priceless. Other places will drink BC wine, but nobody wants Alberta's dirty crude oil pumped to their coast at no benefit to BC, so it can be shipped out of Canada. 

How about building a refinery? Huh?

301 2018-02-12 23:23:17 that is so clever... and so he did; Petrabra Oil; from the shores to the deserts of Iran.
302 2018-02-12 23:23:15 i literally never cook these days loool but around the time of the oil purchase i still did i guess
303 2018-02-12 23:23:09 #CBLive CBD oil is not allowed even cheaper or medical cannabis . Lots of good stories about medical cannabis , but it's a natural product and no patient on that.
304 2018-02-12 23:23:03 Yes!!! Keep Oil in your lamp!!!
305 2018-02-12 23:22:59 This puff got me out here smelling like coconut and tea tree oil ....
306 2018-02-12 23:22:47 She was listing donations to representatives from oil and gas companies. She was accused of making "personal comments," then removed. The so-called "personal comments" related to donations to representatives from oil and gas companies. Are you not able to understand this?
307 2018-02-12 23:22:39 Question, if Jus Soli rules, then why was Indian Naturalization act of 1924 necessary? Would seem redundant. They were here the whole time.
308 2018-02-12 23:22:36 You may have discovered the next great hair care product! Essential banana oil.
309 2018-02-12 23:22:30 Does anyone elses mom smoke all their oil?????????
310 2018-02-12 23:22:25 Try guna argan oil. Pure argan oil. Netauk okay
311 2018-02-12 23:22:13 With this happening to Venezuela , countries that base their economy on oil only should think fast and diversify their economy in growing their GDP.
312 2018-02-12 23:21:57 And BC will do what ever it can to stop dirty tar sand oil from polluting our coastline.
313 2018-02-12 23:21:50 Keep up with the dumb show.
CO2 direct emissions of cows are the only environmental factors to consider?
Google palm oil, avocado, soy - and eat more meat and fish, btw, your brain looks like it needs it
314 2018-02-12 23:21:36 when my girl lissa gets elected to wv's house of delegates, its over for you oil money takin bitches
315 2018-02-12 23:21:01 Especially with Alberta threatening to cut off oil supplies (which also harms them)...we need to focus on the future.

Our governments are so outdated, and not even trying to plan for a future without oil. 

"All their eggs in one basket?"
316 2018-02-12 23:20:50 What is the most important item needed to create wind and solar energy? OIL!!!
317 2018-02-12 23:20:45 Thanks hun! I use Vitamin E oil and i love it, I’m gonna look into this combination though
318 2018-02-12 23:20:42 These days, reports of high world oil prices do not warm the hearts of Cdns, but rather remind us of the billions squandered due to our incompetence in getting access to the global market. #ableg
319 2018-02-12 23:20:42 The @CPC_HQ claim that they and the Harper govt showed real leadership on pipelines. All they did was bully and intimidate BC and Canada into building pipelines and forcing Tar Sands on everyone else. They want to put oil money first. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #CPCBigots
320 2018-02-12 23:20:35 Mrs. Wise, why not ask the same of oil and gas executives. Have you seen their salaries? Yet, they’re unwilling to give 2-3% more of #GPT because the companies can’t afford it. I didn’t vote for coalition members, just legislators.
321 2018-02-12 23:20:17 But your party does not.  Are you a climate science denyer too? Are you going to cram coal and oil down our throats like trump when the entire world is hoping into clean power?How do you feel about this administration walking back regulations on corps that polute? Earth or party?
322 2018-02-12 23:20:17 I made this pizza with Korean beef and French fries over Provolone on Zaatar and olive oil and called it 'Moroccan Astroturf' because it also has focaccia.
323 2018-02-12 23:20:07 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.

325 2018-02-12 23:20:01 My 11yr-old was watching ‘The Emoji Movie’ last night but didn’t finish before bed. She just got home from school AND STARTED IT OVER AGAIN!? Ginkgo & fish oil donations welcome.
326 2018-02-12 23:19:59 I'm already dropping over $100 at valvoline like can you chill with the upsells.. like the fact that I'm getting more than an oil change should make your day.
327 2018-02-12 23:19:58 America, too, is an oil company with an army. (In Re: Standing Rock.) And for years, I have been saying it's medium-paced becoming Russia's pet. 2016? Medium-paced became "level-five alarms" Russia's pet.
328 2018-02-12 23:19:57 1. one who uses patriotism and immense propaghanda to gain support for illegal unjustified brutal acts upon oppressed people for own gains. whether it be oil or money. 
2. one who puts self gains in front of human life 
3. immense dumbass 
329 2018-02-12 23:19:49 This is false. And nobody said oil needed to be eliminated. Just needs to be a last resort, not a first resort. But I'm sure you don't care about the environment, cause your a piece of .

344 2018-02-12 23:18:15 Honestly I think they just use the same dirty air filters at the oil changing place and tell you it’s dirty. Like mine are brand new. Gtfo.
345 2018-02-12 23:18:07 Put phone in hand comrade...

Russian sale to Europe of oil and gas makes Russian have friend nearby.
346 2018-02-12 23:18:03 You can't have solar or wind energy without oil. You need oil for most everything to live and survive. Think I'm full of shit, look it up or are you one of those who have to be told what to think.
347 2018-02-12 23:18:02 You have already destroyed Alberta with these oil fields, now you want to jeopardize BC?  We will enjoy our wine!!
348 2018-02-12 23:17:49 Alotta ifs in your argument. And there’s a difference in fighting because you don’t like someone rather then what ppl do and that’s oil, money, greed

350 2018-02-12 23:17:42 So if the Tar Sands oil was shown to be either unnecessary or dirtier than other oil, you’d be okay shutting them down?

363 2018-02-12 23:16:28 & coconut oil. Stop telling people to put it on their face. I don’t care if it works for you. It is moderately to highly comedogenic, but ok.
364 2018-02-12 23:16:19 Sex is great but have you ever understood shading in an oil painting
365 2018-02-12 23:16:14 How do you use tea tree oil on your skin just put it on?
366 2018-02-12 23:16:10 I wonder how you became such a bully. Bring it on Rachel, we can take it. Standing up to large oil company so they are held accountable when a spill happens is the right thing to do. Do your research they clean 1/2 ass, make us pay when cashing in our resources. Yes Rachel

397 2018-02-12 23:13:02 Trump is talking about levelling some undefined internaional tax on Canadian goods because “Canada doesn’t treat us right.”

Canada also provides the US with more oil than any other country on Earth. So yeah, maybe we should start a trade war.
398 2018-02-12 23:12:59 Why would we UP nasty stuff like oil which has two spills daily?
399 2018-02-12 23:12:32 nah, the cause of ISIS is the USA carpet-bombing civilians and taking down elected leaders at every step of the way towards their goal of more oil. pretty easy to see how they rose.

KKK is Christian, Dawkins is atheist, and 8chan are gamers. Clean yourself up b4 u talk shit.
400 2018-02-12 23:12:01 of all the people to get to reappear in s2 i didnt expect the oil dude. like if we get HIM reappearing it'll be an outrage if atsu never gets to show

414 2018-02-12 23:10:11 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this February? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.
415 2018-02-12 23:10:09 Would the royalty payment every Alaskan gets from their State government from oil drilling be considered an "entitlement?"
416 2018-02-12 23:10:07 He has some, but the third Schmidt car usually has funding from Lucas Oil anyway so they hire the best guy they can get.
417 2018-02-12 23:09:58 My observation: Some of the women are divas and some of the men are macho. When those two groups meet up, they’re bound to clash. It has nothing to do with ethnicity or culture or geography. It’s like oil and water. They don’t mix well.
418 2018-02-12 23:09:53 My dad always changed my flat tire & checked my oil. Any man, I be with I expect them to do the same thing.
419 2018-02-12 23:09:44 Use tea tree oil with a neutral oil and put it on a cotton ball and rub it gently over night. It should be gone the next day
420 2018-02-12 23:09:32 I’ll bet Republicans aren’t the only ones getting oil money
421 2018-02-12 23:09:15 I exfoliate beforehand sometimes but I should do it every time and see what happens. And I should try oil like you suggested..! Thank you, I appreciate the help!! 
422 2018-02-12 23:09:11 Started a new wash regime - Garnier Fructis Damage Eraser Shampoo, Garnier Whole Blend Smoothing Shampoo Creme of Nature Argan Oil Shampoo, Apple Cider Vinegar Clarifying Wash, GF DE Conditioner and the hair is soft a detangles easily
423 2018-02-12 23:09:07 I agree but unless you make massive change now eliminating new and old infrastructure we get nowhere. Your just fighting a small piece of a huge problem with no real change. You have to make change to take the money away from oil. I drive a Tesla charged by solar. That’s a win

431 2018-02-12 23:08:18 why don't laws have a section on funding given to the lawmakers from interested parties like academic papers.
Wouldn't they get a lot more honest if we could see senator so and so is getting money from the clean energy lobby whereas the opposing senator gets money from oil & gas.
432 2018-02-12 23:07:49 @McDonaldsCorp hi IS It true that you guys fry the fries in pork oil?. I need to know for religious reasons. Thank you
433 2018-02-12 23:07:47 Personal comments related to listing donations to representatives from oil and gas companies. There ARE the so-called "personal comments" the speaker is referring to. It's in the video!
434 2018-02-12 23:07:46 Or I think they are a more valuable asset then ya oils and gas industry scared of 7% GPT. Vote to raise that tax on oil and gas in November and give teachers 10k plus increased funding for the classrooms. What sounds better?
435 2018-02-12 23:07:36 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
436 2018-02-12 23:07:24 Gosh Darn. wonder what that experimental high viscous oil’s atomic component ratio was, “before” it spilled off China’s coast    
437 2018-02-12 23:07:16 “Other fuel” is large, especially in cold climates. Is this heating oil? Or does this represent some sort of district heating or similar arrangement?

440 2018-02-12 23:07:02 Hmm, Hilary Blume, whose "Peace Oil" risks undermining/nicking sales from  genuine #Palestinian #ethical #fairtrade #oliveoil, such as #Zaytoun #newsnight.
441 2018-02-12 23:06:39 The influence that Big Oil has over our politicians is scary, dangerous and very short-sighted.
442 2018-02-12 23:06:39 Have you tried exfoliating before you shave and then using just straight up coconut or olive oil after? My hair is pretty light so I don’t have the dark hair issue, but I do have very sensitive skin and I get shaving bumps easily and this helps that a lot.

446 2018-02-12 23:05:52 Oil is not a styling product! Oil will not give you curl definition!
447 2018-02-12 23:05:43 who knows about cars? i’m at the dealership getting an oil change and they’re telling me i need a bunch of stuff done and i want to be sure i’m not being taken advantage of. 
448 2018-02-12 23:05:36 Have heard of fish oil to fight bugs on organic.  In my area we would get no seed without bug spray
449 2018-02-12 23:05:22 No amt of logic will persuade enviro extremists in #BCNDP and @BCGreens who (wrongly) believe they're saving #climate from #globalwarming by blocking @TransMtn, leaving oil in situ and killing jobs in #bcpoli #abpoli and politically @jjhorgan can't/won't risk majority in #BCLeg
450 2018-02-12 23:05:14 those conversations usually go one of two ways for me. 
1- i have no idea where that is 
2- oh yeah i have a buddy in the oil field there

454 2018-02-12 23:04:26 President Muhammadu Buhari is just a Petroleum minister by name, he doesn't have the time to oversee the sector. He should give up the oil portfolio in the interest of the masses.

455 2018-02-12 23:04:23 OIL BRENT US$62.7/bbl -0.16%. Tag Oil discovers oil from secondary target at Pukatea-1 exploration well, in New Zealand's Taranaki basin.
456 2018-02-12 23:04:23 ECONOMICS. China's trade surplus narrows to US$20.34bn in Jan 2018 as imports surge 36.9%yoy, driven by crude oil, iron ore and coal imports.
457 2018-02-12 23:04:17 She was removed for listing donations to representatives from oil and gas companies. It's in the video. Why are you trying to pretend something recorded on video didn't happen? Is it a pathological condition? Seriously asking.
458 2018-02-12 23:04:17 Shopping on the way home - love them. Use butter in the pan not oil - top tip 
459 2018-02-12 23:04:16 Blazers won't be panicking, but it should be a time for desperate hockey. They can't afford to lose this one if they want to sneak into the playoffs. Oil Kings lead 2-1 early second. Kamloops kid Semchuk gets the unique goal. #WHL #Kamloops
460 2018-02-12 23:04:10 I'll use for drink. And I'll make another for DIY coconut oil and paste. Thanks
461 2018-02-12 23:04:10 Goodness. How corrupt are these guys, all paid 1000’s $ by oil related industries and they drag her away from MIC saying that is a personal attack, she was quoting public record facts. Hmm that “ol’ swamp” still seems pretty comfortably full of slimey water. 
462 2018-02-12 23:04:09 That could be one of the reasons! It definitely fools me into thinking it's an oil painting every time. :D
463 2018-02-12 23:04:05 It certainly worked at least as well as the generic coconut oil I’ve been using for the past month or so. No hunger whatsoever all morning, even with a good gym workout before I ate at lunchtime. I’ll be tracking cumulative difference in coming weeks!
464 2018-02-12 23:04:05 Trump can’t get a cut of Russian oil production in Arctic due to sanctions.. seems he’s working hard for a cut in the arms deals happening between Russia, and North Korea, Syria, Iran and Palestine?   Trump doing everything in his power to push them to Putin.  All to go nuclear.

466 2018-02-12 23:03:54 Good on her for refusing to back down. But as those on the panel accepted the gas and oil cash surely they should have been the ones asked to step down and recuse themselves in a fair system.

474 2018-02-12 23:02:42 Our illustrious leader can’t even find a way to get a pipeline approved that would inject billions to the economy, take our independence off the America’s as our only buyer of oil.
475 2018-02-12 23:02:35 Coverage with a liberal twist. Just like pouring motor oil on ice cream. No thanks.
476 2018-02-12 23:02:27 Oil n gas?
477 2018-02-12 23:02:23 General rule of thumb is when I have a bad Monday the week ends up pretty good. The way today had gone I'm expecting to strike oil by Thursday.
478 2018-02-12 23:02:19 He has a bunch of idiots fooled too. There are actually people that believe he is opening land up for sportsman when in reality he is letting big oil in the back door. He will continue this until we shut down this bogus administration. #scumbag

482 2018-02-12 23:01:52 Drizzle with olive oil, cumin and chilli flakes and bake in the oven.... could have that as a side dish or blitz after cooked in a blender for a squash purée with pan fried chicken and green...
483 2018-02-12 23:01:51 Horn sounded in middle of play to signal a video review had been conducted and the Oil Kings had been awarded a goal. They lead 2-1 early second. Haven't seen that before. #WHL

486 2018-02-12 23:01:33 Not enough money there.   Did you read the proposal?  Money going to mineral and oil and gas development, energy line right of ways.  All needed for sure but tilted way to heavy. More money for parks.  Let the hunters and fishers and farmers pay to use the blm land. Sad sad sad
487 2018-02-12 23:01:24 I am home since the 25th January sick with that virus and trying to shake it with oil of oregano and carrot juice, pure organic coconut water, and lots of other goodies. Fever and headaches won’t seem to go?

501 2018-02-12 22:59:33 Israel wants Iran's position on the sea, Iran's oil, Iran's beautiful women for Israel's sex slave trade, and Iran's money in its coffers. Israel is belligerent,aggressive and
imperialistic. Not only does Israel no want peace, it wants the whole Middle East.
502 2018-02-12 22:59:31 Called and talked to his office to let them know it's really not that much of a difference maker ! As every major oil company tried them years ago on their tankers ! And dropped them after a couple years
503 2018-02-12 22:59:28 many art programs would be cut as well as science based and community based programs--but yet the rich will get richer!! The oil will flow! The fracking and drilling will continue!!
504 2018-02-12 22:59:26 Do you think Republicans Matt Jackson or Chip Carter would better represent your values??

I think turning on these Dems—who are each faced with a very tough vote on this day—is precisely what the oil overlords are hoping for (one way or the other).
505 2018-02-12 22:59:24 The same way the Niger Deltans should have 100% resource control. Nigeria is running a mono economy. Largely dependent on oil. The federating states all depend on it. If the Niger Deltans are not eligible to attend LASU, I can’t see why it’s resources shld fund LASU.
506 2018-02-12 22:59:18 Scheduling an oil change for your car makes you an adult, Right? 
507 2018-02-12 22:59:07 My professor got us in class smelling oil 
508 2018-02-12 22:58:59 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
509 2018-02-12 22:58:46 Extra large kitchen rotisserie. I took a basket used for heating veggies & filled it with nuggets.

Tiny bit of cooking oil on the inside rubbed in with a paper towel

Since the temperature is exactly the same as in the oven I can tumble them. Saves me from having to flip them
510 2018-02-12 22:58:33 Delighted - hope they win. Water is the new oil #DavidandGoliath
511 2018-02-12 22:58:27 Its @SenSanders  message for as long as I've known him as mayor of Burlington. We (the people) have the numbers, but can't match the money of oil, Koch, nra and Russia.  Need to end Citizens United to cut off flow of dirty money.
512 2018-02-12 22:58:26 >Venezuela was rich during the 20th century
>Implanted socialism more and more heavily towards the end of the century

527 2018-02-12 22:56:18 Trying to get everything squared away before baby.. oil change done, window tinting currently, next need my car washed and seats cleaned and I’ll be good
528 2018-02-12 22:56:03 What about poor people who live in the path of natural disasters amplified by climate change *caused* by big businesses? How about we just decline any new permits for oil/gas projects and force a shift to renewables ASAP? This is going to affect everyone’s bottom line.
529 2018-02-12 22:55:56 Based on our state's long history of implementing bad ideas, I think the oil overlords will figure out a way to pass the @StepUpOklahoma plan, but at least for today, it was cool to see it fail.
530 2018-02-12 22:55:53 Oil burns fucking hurt
531 2018-02-12 22:55:42 Life's a lot easier when your dog will eat anything.

534 2018-02-12 22:55:14 Have you heard of the feud between the Province of Alberta and British Columbia in Canada? We don't want their oil/bitumen spilling on our coastline (lots of politics here) so they have called for a ban on our fabulous BC wine. We produce world-renowned winds here.

537 2018-02-12 22:55:09 He favourited one of my tweets once. And his wife and I discussed coconut oil after that, so ya he’s pretty much my bff now
538 2018-02-12 22:54:48 hopefully that’s a coolant leak, not an oil leak
539 2018-02-12 22:54:44 No climate crisis caused by oil and gas. We should tax the energy sectors like oil, gas and coal to pay for the climate damage. Not give them a pass!
540 2018-02-12 22:54:41 Oil field if I had to guess. TX drivers make Bank and they're good guys. You do you Shark! We're with ya!
541 2018-02-12 22:54:37 there is no oil in Honduras, so little marco doesn't care.  (though is fertile ground for the #garment industry = american #sweatshops, plus also an american bridge for the uninterrupted flow of drugs into said their own american soil.) #americanganster

543 2018-02-12 22:54:22 He's allergic to dust. It's been a long battle (see past tweets about Suttree). Fish oil upsets his tummy too much :(
544 2018-02-12 22:54:18 It was the team chosen by 3.5 million people not directly in any way by the Oil - I was there in 84-85 & again last night. It was honouring them but focused on Semenko.  I think jealousy is playing a lot into this by other teams.

579 2018-02-12 22:50:16 I really waited 3hrs for a oil changeeeee , never again
580 2018-02-12 22:50:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

586 2018-02-12 22:48:35 Cause it’s snake oil, meant to deflect from 8 years of Bobby Jindal and Steve Waguespack’s failed ecomic theriories. U may have unlimited dark pac money, but the people see right thru the Jindal Smoke & Mirrors.
587 2018-02-12 22:48:30 Thug donny @realDonaldTrump is showing his 'ol slime ball ways - making some bling off of all our backs and probably making more deals on the side - you know oil, steel more towers @GOP should be so proud #ImpeachTrump
588 2018-02-12 22:48:28 Instead, we’ll keep lowering teacher pay, implement backwards thinking social laws, log our state forests, steal people’s gas and oil, and generally run away any young (or old) people still left here that want to make this a better place.
589 2018-02-12 22:48:16 Honestly i use jojoba oil at night and ponds in the morning. You use black charcoal face cleansers? That’s what i use or black soap and moisturize twice a day. You use face masks?
590 2018-02-12 22:47:55 Join am with Kings oil since na Jesus second birthday you wan celebrate. Ignoramus
591 2018-02-12 22:47:53 Who’s got more resources who’s got more landmass and we are second only to Saudi Arabia in oil. You are building walls cutting yourself off YOUR economy going to be hurting very badly pretty soon

This is a tough vote for Okie progressives. Our oil overlords wanted to enlist teacher unions & school advocates onto their side. And it worked.
595 2018-02-12 22:47:37 I just heard there's a new oil and gas find off Mumbai, that's within Turkey's zone too! 

Btw if Erdogan really wanted a solution he'd sign up to UNCLOS like everyone else. But you guys prefer thieving, which is more profitable to be fair.
596 2018-02-12 22:47:24 What is the matter with Amt of oil now?? Build refinery’s here for Canada
597 2018-02-12 22:47:13 You have to get baptized in the peanut oil
598 2018-02-12 22:46:34 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
599 2018-02-12 22:46:15 THE GUY THAT DID MY OIL CHANGE ASKED FOR MY PHONE NUMBER AND MY CRUSH CANT EVEN LOOK AT ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

604 2018-02-12 22:45:58 I almost put olive oil in my tea instead of honey
605 2018-02-12 22:45:48 This has given me an idea for a brass instrument maintenance joint- get your valve oil changed while u wait! 
606 2018-02-12 22:45:48 Instead of selling out for @StepUpOklahoma, maybe the @Okea and its supporters should demand real change / action that addresses our state's revenue problems, and not grasp for the pay raise carrot being dangled in front of them by the OIl Overlords.
607 2018-02-12 22:45:44 Oh ok. That’s why I just leave it in my hair after I shower. Smh. Castor oil? Use it like shampoo too?
608 2018-02-12 22:45:26 Our poor #environment, just make sure you pay BC to built a fund for oil spills and something to benefit people in BC.  Think Canada 1st

Wenn man es umdreht steht OIL 
612 2018-02-12 22:44:25 Did your check from the oil industry / CIA clear?
613 2018-02-12 22:44:23 Now I gotta get this oil changed 
614 2018-02-12 22:44:06 By resources I did not mean oil. i was referring to fresh drinkable water, breathable air and land to grow food that is not toxic from poison.
615 2018-02-12 22:43:55 I mean, you're right, but that still doesn't mean we should be accepting more oil & gas infrastructure when we needed to stop burning oil like, 40 years ago
616 2018-02-12 22:43:37 In 1 week 2 jail releases in  Florida who 1 had possession of the "oil" other the "wax" made from marijuana for felon possession without a script and some kind of synthetic charge. They both felt med marijuana lulled pp into false sense of dereg hope but setup 4  charges
617 2018-02-12 22:43:31 Fine, we won’t be buying their shitty cars that leak oil and we can sell the best lumber in the world to China.  Canada will NOT pay a 30% tariff and the US will be suffering when everyone stops buying their shit.
618 2018-02-12 22:43:25 coconut oil is truly amazing i use it for 2 days but  i already can see its amazing work
619 2018-02-12 22:43:07 Yes thank you for putting me on! I simplified my routine so much and the buffet serum, ascorbyl glucoside and marula oil are the bulk of it. 

Just need to find my perfect under eye serum 
620 2018-02-12 22:42:56 Oh damn I was about to say them not tightening the oil filter correctly could be the cause of and leak and steam (due to the oil on the hot running parts under the hood) but overall hopefully it’s just something loose somewhere for your pockets sake lol
621 2018-02-12 22:42:51 희희 즐커되셔용
622 2018-02-12 22:42:49 Rocked dinner tonight: salmon in teriyaki sauce, 4 rice blend in coconut oil, zucchini/radishes/squash in garlic stir fry. About 500 calories (less, realistically). Absolutely delicious, if I say so myself.
623 2018-02-12 22:42:48 Je t'en prie ma cherie! Oui le tea tree oil c'est vraiment efficace contre les boutons
624 2018-02-12 22:42:34 Because it’s all about his bottom line and Russian oil money!!
625 2018-02-12 22:42:31 evening primrose oil on my face and white bedsheets is not a good combination
626 2018-02-12 22:42:22 Thanks for the info ! I'll make do with a new load of oils for now then, Was holding off ordering but i'll top of the Oil stock then.

Cheers
627 2018-02-12 22:42:22 Oil?
628 2018-02-12 22:41:25 what's the big deal, they're just going to get a snack in the kitchen (probably some oil or the dog)
629 2018-02-12 22:41:13 Yeah, right, like the US ever actually was about protecting the Kurds. That's an excuse to be in the area fighting for oil companies. Like the women of Afghanistan, they 'protect' them by calling them 'collateral damage'.
630 2018-02-12 22:41:06 Ive had this coconut oil/honey mask in my hair for about an hour and I don’t feel like washing it out 
631 2018-02-12 22:41:04 Coconut oil is the key to making Luna eat her dog food... fantastic 
632 2018-02-12 22:40:58 After what I just found out, olive oil and a match is what I need to cure me
633 2018-02-12 22:40:49 siri how do i clean beard oil off my phone
634 2018-02-12 22:40:46 Yeah, now that the pressure is on and your charity is exposed that old boot has no place to hide, it all charities the world over that are corrupt not just Oxfam, 'Cancer Research' has obviously done no research otherwise they would disclose that marijuanna oil kills cancer cells
635 2018-02-12 22:40:37 @MurphysLaw74. I know Klef has been in rumors and hasn’t played well but he is a future D. He is young and will still improve. The oil need D and he will stay. Just look at    Harmonic and Brodie this year and Klingberg last season. Doubt he gets moved
636 2018-02-12 22:40:33 Posession of foreign oil reserves to protect the dollar...
The World reserve currency,,,
Therefore dollar simply represents warcrimes,,,,
Countries who ally with this policy,,,, ally with warcriminals,,,- this will never reach the MSM,, - because they own them,,!!!
637 2018-02-12 22:40:28 Saturday at Sears with my Dad, lil 6yr old RanDad gone Gray Baggin for tools/hardware/appliances/tires/oil change/tuneup/etc, always see family friends all in various depts of Roebucks, garden dept/clothes/fishing stuff, had it all, a social event. Sad. Ruined by a hedge fund
638 2018-02-12 22:40:18 It's all about perspective to these people. The USA world's greatest superpower, or largest terrorist organisation. They have seen the US kill and maim thousands in Muslim countries over oil. I hope this offered some insight to why some celebrated 9/11
639 2018-02-12 22:40:10 Eh, who is it that has to oil the key to make sure that it fits the padlock?
Have not got a clue what I’m on about now.... maybe just as well

649 2018-02-12 22:38:46 If it's really "Canada's"oil that we must get to market,why did we bag the NEP in 1985 -the one that insists Canadians be assured reasonable gas prices for their oil?Why does Alberta get the piddling royalties we beg for,& when did "Canada" decide to give the US a 30% discount?

654 2018-02-12 22:37:53 I went to Kia for an oil change, they washed my car & filled my tank. lol that's love.
655 2018-02-12 22:37:52 This is why we aren't taking any oil, opium, or minerals from the Middle Eastern nations we went to war against and helped "rebuild" right?
656 2018-02-12 22:37:51 Not difficult,all oil producers want higher prices.Low oil prices were an attempt to destabilise Russia and Venezuela,All that happened was Saudi Arabia got poorer.
657 2018-02-12 22:37:48 Currently sitting in the waiting area while getting an oil change googling how to use a Keurig coffee maker #dontjudgeme

665 2018-02-12 22:36:49 Yum, never had it like that. We fry with tons of olive oil, butter, and ouzo ... soooooo good.
666 2018-02-12 22:36:48 It all complete snake oil. As soon as you diverge from your customer’s regs you either have to comply with two sets of rules, adding cost, or you can’t trade. The dogs in the streets know this.
667 2018-02-12 22:36:33 But I highly recommend buying oils from Muslims on the street cop a few and apply the oil directly to skin , a little cologne  (perfume in your case)  over the oil , and only cologne on clothes and you’ll smell good all day ,and cologne has a different smell on a females skin
668 2018-02-12 22:36:30 I've run across fundies who claimed that saving fossil fuels was against god's will - he had given us "just enough" oil, and when it runs out Jesus will return.

Saving fuel delays the End Times and is thus blasphemous.

671 2018-02-12 22:36:13 ..., and allowing oil/gas tax loopholes (closing wells to avoid 7% tax), is not how we solve our problems. The bills have been placed under the appealing pretense of a $5,000 increase in teacher salary, but this is not the solution. We would benefit, but at what cost?
672 2018-02-12 22:36:12 There was a fun moment today getting my oil changed where I didn’t know where the lever was to pop my hood. I’m doing good things for women.

686 2018-02-12 22:34:38 if you are ever stuck with a temporary tattoo on your face, use coconut oil. it works

693 2018-02-12 22:33:59 Obviously we’re less reliant and that’s good but the oil you’ll get instead of ours is either tons of human rights issues or from tight shale in America. Look into that and the water usage. That stuff is bad
694 2018-02-12 22:33:56 to all the beauty experts: why is my face oily until i put oil on it??
695 2018-02-12 22:33:50 That’s exactly what heard today.  We MUST tax the oil and gas industry more.  If you were against the one cent sales tax, how could in favor of this bill that includes taxes on cigarettes, gas, and auto purchases!
696 2018-02-12 22:33:48 Would those "better ways" involve people instead handing their hard-earned money over to you in return for your snake oil?

705 2018-02-12 22:32:33 See our neighboring states that have less gas and oil production than we do?? They have a much higher severance tax on gas and oil compared to us. Also, leave the business inventory tax as is, but this would require our governor and his rich friends to personally loose money.
706 2018-02-12 22:32:32 So I guess it’s better to stop a pipeline and bring it in by ship. You have to get it from somewhere. Let’s see split a hull on the boat what happens to your harbours. One way or the other you need oil. If your against PL then you should be against ships. Just saying

711 2018-02-12 22:32:17 21st century snake oil has the funniest branding. like all of them are the most comical combinations of 'ye olde chemist's bespoke healthe tonics and enlivening elixirs' and 'hack your biocybernetic matrix's source code'
712 2018-02-12 22:32:02 How much oil does it take to make a solar panel?  Gas for the workers, oil to refine silicon, steel, copper, glass, rubber, mounts and waterproofing, when the oil is gone... so are the panels.

721 2018-02-12 22:31:08 You haven't got a freaking clue what's best for the environment and for the American people. You don't understand science and you're in the pocket of the oil business.

732 2018-02-12 22:30:19 Fracking is good, oil and gas, tells Ng me you don't use it? Wind farms, waste of money. Still, keep your negativity pouring out
733 2018-02-12 22:30:18 I made this pizza with Pepperoni and jalapenos over smoked tofu on Zaatar and olive oil and called it 'Moroccan Platter' because it also has thin crust.
734 2018-02-12 22:30:11 It looks like @TempesttBledsoe. Come on ppl! #AmySherald didn’t capture her. As a former oil painter and portrait artist, I find politics influenced artist choice more than merit. It’s a da*n shame! It does NOT do @MichelleObama justice. And anatomy fail with that arm!
735 2018-02-12 22:30:09 Starvation diet? You greens are dumb. The majority of oil goes straight to the US through various pipelines. It is sold at currently 25$ less a barrel as the US is a "single source" customer. Once the new KM is built the price differential drops.

744 2018-02-12 22:28:41 but as for oil reserves & more importantly ability to access them that's another matter

746 2018-02-12 22:28:38 Erik Prince's endeavors will have disastrous affects on Somalia & knowing Oil / Gas is involved the stakes & repercussions will be much higher & Farmaajo is powerless against Erik Prince which makes the situation much worse - Our country is in for a rude awakening

751 2018-02-12 22:27:55 You are not arguing logically. The environment has not enjoyed the benefits of an oil based economy.  The oil sands is scraping the bottom of the barrel and must stop. A tough decision but the right one for so many logical reasons.
752 2018-02-12 22:27:54 And unlike Canadian oil, Norway nationalized their oil extraction, so the PEOPLE get all the benefits, not the rich oil companies and their stock holders.

768 2018-02-12 22:25:52 Pruit is anathema to the environment. He’s the direct opposite of anyone who could do good. Ties to oil and gas, has sued the epa more than once. I say he’s got to go and he has demonstrated a conflict of interest with epa!

774 2018-02-12 22:25:08 Statoil heeft zakelijke belangen in Rusland en zal dit mogelijk bij toekomstige exploratie van Noordpoolgebied alleen maar meer krijgen. Deep sea oil is meer hun kracht (en minder van Lukoil en andere Russische maatschappijen). Zou makkelijke keuze zijn voor Van der Veer
775 2018-02-12 22:25:01 Some people do call the diet zero carb or zc, but it ends up confusing others by muddling intentions. They end up asking things like, "Why don't you use coconut oil when it has no carbs?". The goal isn't to avoid carbs. That's just an unavoidable consequence of eating only meat.

778 2018-02-12 22:24:46 No, actually Alberta experiences numerous spills on a daily basis.  As far as environmental standards elsewhere, I don’t know, but economically speaking Saudi oil is the cheapest to produce, so use up theirs first.  If you think we need oil, leave ours for much later days.
779 2018-02-12 22:24:40 Just be glad your parents never gave you Castor Oil. That's the worst medicine I've ever had.

786 2018-02-12 22:24:25 But is Alberta’s dirty dilbit required? We’re getting less and less reliant on oil every day.

790 2018-02-12 22:23:50 So we get independence now and invest in an oil fund. Still vast reserves and lots of unsurveyed areas north & west & as you previously stated hydro is an under used resource especially small scale. In a country with all this potential their should be no fuel poverty

798 2018-02-12 22:23:06 Oil prices went up 15 cents today, I'd hardly call that a bounce.
799 2018-02-12 22:22:56 If I had the energy I would go back and find all the bull stories on oil at $65 saying: 1) industry under invested 2) weak dollar 3) Venezuela done 4) OPEC compliance etc etc.  New narrative: US ramping as if “new” #OOTT

Want to hoard cash? 
OK. The value of the dollar fluctuates

Precious metals or oil? 
Sure. Smaller return compared to stocks & fluctuates on value

Rare coins or art? Very small markets of niche investors. Good luck selling in economic downturn.

809 2018-02-12 22:21:55 Mark, note the almost collapse of the Venezuelan economy, an oil rich country. State driving Econ Growth through direct ownership and involvement is a disaster except in China. And we cannot compare ourselves with China.

813 2018-02-12 22:21:45 Actually, it's a battle between the people of the United States and a snake oil vending moron surrounded by traitors and opportunist oligarchs.
814 2018-02-12 22:21:41 Dropped my car off to get brakes and tires today. The guy from the shop calls me and tells me they checked my fluids while it was there and it was 4 quarts low on oil ... it only takes 5 quarts... so that’s where I’m at in my life 
815 2018-02-12 22:21:39 There are a variety of factors that affect the price of oil, straightforward economics of need and supply, exogenous or unpredictable shocks

820 2018-02-12 22:21:22 Dont call it #OilSands that is propaganda.  Historically the formation is the #TarSands - however accurate that name.

Also the “oil” name creates a negative impression of spills - but of course morons who push this stuff are SO stupid they push the worse name.

823 2018-02-12 22:20:48 You guys need to understand, Russian Presidential election is soon and Putin cannot afford the economy to plunge back into recession. Higher oil prices mean a better economy for Russia. We will actually see higher prices later on in the year.

Important point: local control over oil and gas is a bi-partisan local control issue. Goes beyond position on fracking: protecting families, land use planning.

857 2018-02-12 22:17:02 I don't get it, maybe because "capital" is an abstract word.  Oil is substitutable with renewable power plus batteries.  Certainly car & house petroleum use is, which would leave enough oil for farm equipment / heavy transport even if those weren't

873 2018-02-12 22:13:47 We have a diffuser in rhys’ room and we put in eucalyptus and lavender to help soothe him when he’s sick. Also we put a few drops in his bath water. If you do go the oil route make sure you get 100% oils and do lots of research.

914 2018-02-12 22:10:43 Your first sentence tells the story. So be it. Big Oil and Calgary had their day during the Harper government. Those days are gone. Where are the Calgary voices in caucus? Does LPC need Alberta votes? Keep looking to TO for economic direction.

928 2018-02-12 22:09:25 There's this one guy at the Jersey Mike's in Burbank that is SO FUCKING RUDE every time.  He accidentally put oil on my sandwich and I was like OH NO OIL PLEASE!  And he dead stared at me and was like YOU SAID OIL

She said, "Take this… jar, and fill it with olive oil."

971 2018-02-12 22:03:19 Irrelevant. War invigorates domestic drilling in the United States and Canada, it also distracts from regulations on it. It creates fear for supply which brings up oil prices, hence creating more demand. War, pretty much anywhere, has been a consistent way to bring up oil prices.

982 2018-02-12 22:01:16 Not at all. My contention is that everything has risks. Very few things are risk free. If Canada wants to reap the benefits of the oil and gas industry, we also need to find a way to build policy and procedures to minimize the risks of that industry, not just scream "NOOOOOO!"

1011 2018-02-12 21:57:27 Yes! When I’m on keto I drink coffee w butter, coconut oil, and heavy cream in it (aka bulletproof coffee). You gotta blend it all together so it’s frothy and delicious and doesn’t just have oil sitting on top

1013 2018-02-12 21:57:08 Ferguson: Just as the anointing oil ran down Aaron’s beard onto his robes, so Christ’ anointing unto suffering runs over his life upon those of us who are untied to him.
1014 2018-02-12 21:56:58 I made an appointment for 4:15 to get an oil change & they have yet to start working on my car ....... why did they even require that I make an appointment 
1015 2018-02-12 21:56:42 Massive amounts in an oil tanker....you're not getting any farther ahead with the discussion using the same poor comparisons.

1017 2018-02-12 21:56:21 So we are not going to be needing a whole lot of oil????

1019 2018-02-12 21:56:18 Meanwhile people will suffer because of the high cost of oil, another reason it should be off the market.  Let oil flow instead of making the traders richer
1020 2018-02-12 21:56:17 The purpose of the prepaid card was to load it with funds from @tylerperry oil refinery in Africa. He used Mr. Perry profile so i assumed it was legit. He was going to load it too purchase a home, new furniture and have my mildewed clothes cleaned. With a stroke we are slow.
1021 2018-02-12 21:56:04 I am sufficiently tired of my joints' (esp. knees') relentless campaign of uncomfortable clicking at this point to be willing to consider regularly taking cod-liver oil, even though I'm almost certain it can't really do much to help :(
1022 2018-02-12 21:56:02 Two reasons:

1. The views and nightlife 
2. Oil picked back up..
1023 2018-02-12 21:55:38 Stupidly spending 7 trillion in the ME? If it's so stupid why are you so pro-oil? Why did you hire an oil czar to be your secretary of state? You say it's stupid to support oil-producing countries, but your actions speak louder.

1028 2018-02-12 21:55:11 The new go-to bad Twitter investment argument: "if you did that the past 5 years, you'd have done poorly!" Of course, this is true of many great investment ideas. Homebuilders = bad buy 2006; great buy 2011. Oil E&P= bad buy 1997; great buy 2002. Etc, etc.
1029 2018-02-12 21:54:51 Also weird how the other countries relying on oil weren’t totally wrecked. Seems like relying on one resource could be a problem, but that’s what you have to do, because nothing of value actually gets produced in socialism.
1030 2018-02-12 21:54:45 The Frank Reich introductory press conference will be tomorrow at 3:30pm at Lucas Oil.  #ColtsNation #Colts
1031 2018-02-12 21:54:45 I was using a coconut oil spray. I keep my cast iron seasoned by rubbing it either with that same spray or with olive oil after cleaning, before storing. I’ll try using little to no non-stick spray next time. Thanks for the tips.
1032 2018-02-12 21:54:38 Most of the world's oil production for the whole of the 1980's is in the soles of these bad boys
1033 2018-02-12 21:54:29 Oil Money :O
1034 2018-02-12 21:54:28 1/2 If the Feds feel it is in the national interest they can build a refinery and we can consume the refined oil domestically.  Otherwise legitimate scientific concerns should be investigated.  The #BCNDP haven’t said no to #KinderMorgan they merely said proper scientific review
1035 2018-02-12 21:54:21 Yes definitely. I let it rest sometimes in a marinade of heritage tomatoes, chillis, oregano, red wine vinegar and olive oil. Very yum!
1036 2018-02-12 21:54:09 I know someone whose home is in BC but works in the oil industry in Northern Alberta. An industry that employs Canadians, not just Albertans!
1037 2018-02-12 21:53:57 Was making a batch of Unicrois Sauce for the #RGCX podiums except instead of the recipe rapeseed oil I used....garlic infused rapeseed oil - flippin Heston does Embro
1038 2018-02-12 21:53:54 United spend their own  money the money they make from their own revenue city spend oil money big big big difference!!!
1039 2018-02-12 21:53:47 You can talk shit when you have 20 league titles and win a champions league, oil money F.C.
1040 2018-02-12 21:53:44 Never use more than 3 buzzwords in a sentence. It sets off the audience's "snake oil" alarm.
1041 2018-02-12 21:53:33 Your boss ignores the will of 75% of the American people for private industries, big oil and the NRA. He needs to wake up and listen to the American people, not the dirty dollar bill.
1042 2018-02-12 21:53:15  boys gotta scrape that oil with your boots

1044 2018-02-12 21:53:02 I’m pretty sure we didn’t take any of their oil and they’re better off than they were they didn’t have to die for nothing that was Obamas fault
1045 2018-02-12 21:52:55 I oil my scalp way too often for it to constantly be dry like this
1046 2018-02-12 21:52:53 Amtrak is Federal org and as such contributes no $$ to political campaigns and its lobbying is tantamount to a squeaky mouse. Freight railroads, automotive and oil companies are the 800lb gorilla in the room and this is the result. #shameful
1047 2018-02-12 21:52:46 Well, get the oil out - then invest in rebuilding what marginal damage oil extraction does to N parks...

As for beaches - it's not like these things constantly leak oil... it happens once in like 5 years. And you clean it up

..not a big deal compared to the massive econ boost
1048 2018-02-12 21:52:45 I take a product called ADP, by Biotics Research. It's emulsified oregano oil, and very strong. Oregano is a natural antibiotic. Great for digestion too eh candida overgrowth.
1049 2018-02-12 21:52:31 I'm on the third bottle of baby oil 
1050 2018-02-12 21:52:16 Im waiting for my oil change to finish and my dumbass was looking for my keys for a good 3 min then i remembered im getting a fkn oil change lol
1051 2018-02-12 21:52:03 Brought my mechanic a sucker to say thanks for changing my oil. What did you do today?
1052 2018-02-12 21:52:01 all that damn baby oil lmaoo
1053 2018-02-12 21:51:53 Thank you for saying it so I didn't have to.
So sick of the GOP trotting out this same old debunked economic theory that relies on "Magic Markets" and "Corporate Welfare" and selling it to the poor and stupid as a cure-all.
Republicans are fiscal snake oil salesmen.
#TrumpBudget
1054 2018-02-12 21:51:24 it's just their wings for some reason... maybe the oil they use... it takes a hold and kills me

i can eat B Dubs and have no probs 
1055 2018-02-12 21:51:22 That may be true but Islamists have been around for centuries. They have always wanted the same things, but obviously before they were in no position to impose themselves. The wests obsession with middle east oil has galvanized & helped to arm them.
1056 2018-02-12 21:51:16 yeah girl! i bought some raw shea butter body lotion , scar oil (that i mix with my lotion), face lotion (which works bombbbb btw esp if you have dry skin during this weather), body butter and a body scrub. been blessing me!!
1057 2018-02-12 21:51:06 have u tried castor oil?
1058 2018-02-12 21:50:59 What kind of oil are you using? some will smoke much faster than others and is the seasoning of your cast iron well done? I would figure you wont need as much oil :) I don't eat a lot of meat base hamburgers but that would be my guess :)
1059 2018-02-12 21:50:54 Why on earth would you think putting oil and butter in a coffee is a good idea 
1060 2018-02-12 21:50:48 I thought u were singing a verse from Midnight Oil. lol
1061 2018-02-12 21:50:46 I have to go get an oil change but I don’t wanna drive to Wal Mart and then wait 
1062 2018-02-12 21:50:45 Yet we have @realDonaldTrump saying #ClimateChange is a hoax, along with many other #GOPCoconspirators in bed with the oil and coal industries. We are the only country in whose government blatantly lies to its people about climate change...and blind #GOPLemmings believe it.
1063 2018-02-12 21:50:44 I did say earlier on a different forum CITEH are just fucking amazing..
It's incredible what multi Billionaire oil baron owners can achieve
1064 2018-02-12 21:50:27 when i bought this audi, i didn’t realize it was gonna be 97$ for a fucking oil change
1065 2018-02-12 21:50:12 Are you saying the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico would be any different than a bitumen spill? You want us to wait for your first spill before we object? Nonsense!
1066 2018-02-12 21:50:09 So because we can't undo past mistakes with oil we have to work with things as they are today & we are not like Norway, we don't have a fund & neither do we hunt whales
1067 2018-02-12 21:49:45 Love smothering myself in moisturising oil and getting into bed all slimy 
1068 2018-02-12 21:49:24 Frank Reich will be introduced as the #Colts head coach Tuesday at 3:30 ET at Lucas Oil. @my44news
1069 2018-02-12 21:49:23 Okey, Let's agree that clean energy is the future and not the coal or oil. There is people witch makes profitt by making fear of the climate change, but that's not meaning it's a hoax. They're making profitt by the fact, an other example is the polluters, just that they use lies.
1070 2018-02-12 21:49:18 The real change we need is independence to get away from metropolitan snake oil salesmen like you.
1071 2018-02-12 21:49:06 I came in expecting to have to pay $60 for an oil change and it was free!!!

1076 2018-02-12 21:48:39 Thats how Colony Grill in Stamford started. An idea and a dream. Best hot oil pizza I have ever tasted. Linda and Vince know what im talking about
1077 2018-02-12 21:48:28 Hanging is too good for that oil slick they call "The Obama Presidential Portrait"
1078 2018-02-12 21:48:16 Yah palm oil is pretty garbage most of the time. I'm not sure where they source the vitamin a palmitate, but it's chillin in the .5% or less section at least.  

Palm oil is pretty damn difficult to avoid. Good on ya for that
1079 2018-02-12 21:48:12 I think Thatchers govt could've & should've used the economic opportunity of North Sea Gas & North Sea Oil differently but we can't go back & change that
1080 2018-02-12 21:48:07 Virgin, D-Norman, says oil and gas companies will never pay their fair share if Step Up Oklahoma plan is approved with 4 percent gross production tax rate for first 3 years.
1081 2018-02-12 21:48:02 Most of these brilliant Scots partnered with folks in England. I imagine some of the SNP disciples want history books changed to reflect how the evil Boulton stole Watt's ideas ... and drank his oil.
1082 2018-02-12 21:47:48 Lunch: spiced chicken breast with beetroot, salad and almonds
Dinner: 3 eggs omelette with goat cheese, ham, chives, black pepper and olive oil.

1083 2018-02-12 21:47:47 Rep. Virgin debates against citing it not being a high enough tax on oil and gas. “They have to pay their fair share and if this bill passes they never will.” #okleg

1094 2018-02-12 21:46:13 Great to see the photo op of 5 minutes of "getting your hands dirty".  Will you start chopping down ancient trees to free space for oil companies next?  That will take some time but I have confidence you will do it.
1095 2018-02-12 21:46:04 And thus you are ENTITLED to collect on your record. The illiteracy of Americans voters is dangerous to their own well-being. Buy a dictionary, learn to Google.

When was the last time there was a oil tanker spill in BC'S waters?
1097 2018-02-12 21:45:50 
1098 2018-02-12 21:45:48 These lines are built and paid for by the rate payers- it isn't yours to sell you crooked clueless fu*ker. Selling national parks, ocean leases while subsidizing oil industry bull 
1099 2018-02-12 21:45:38 Is the oil in the ground actually required by anyone or any industry, or do we need to extract it just to employ people and make more money for a few already rich people?
1100 2018-02-12 21:45:34 If we found oil on mars, we'd be there within a year. We'd also have the answer to one of mankind's biggest questions. Anyone care to guess?
1101 2018-02-12 21:45:25 Well, that was a disaster, or near disaster. I don't know what I did wrong this time, maybe the oil was too hot? Fried chicken looks okay, last pieces look a little burnt. Hope they're cooked through. No grease fires or burns.
1102 2018-02-12 21:45:04 Rep. Virgin saying Republicans are coming on board, who weren't before, because oil has signed off on it. She says oil agrees because it's 4%, or 7% on the ballot in November.
1103 2018-02-12 21:44:58 These guys sound like snake oil salesmen to me    !!!!!!!!!!!
1104 2018-02-12 21:44:47 If scent cannabis oil triggered nausea, then no go? Anxiety already = nausea. Now, ginger gravol for nausea, ginger tea sorta helps anxiety.
1105 2018-02-12 21:44:42 Rep. Emily Virgin, D-Norman, calls oil and gas industry the wealthiest in the history of the world but says OK cos are supporting 4 percent gross production tax rate because they're afraid of 7 percent.
1106 2018-02-12 21:44:30 Rep. Virgin now voting against the measure...focusing on GPT for oil and gas, references the 7% GPT that may be voted on in the fall.

1130 2018-02-12 21:42:07 I'm no geologist, or driller, or oil producer, so forgive my ignorance, but isn't the flattening of the Permian "new well production", from H2-17 to Q1-18 a bad sign for scaled future production increase, to what was observed in the "shale explosion" of 2017?  Is it a plateau?

1146 2018-02-12 21:40:49 I look like an oil painting in real life. Seriously rocking 10w30! You ever try and butter bread with your forehead... And were successful?
1147 2018-02-12 21:40:37 here getting a oil change....lets hope they dont tell me my car need $100K in repairs
1148 2018-02-12 21:40:35 Stop selling them oil. See how that plays out.
1149 2018-02-12 21:40:26 They're not dependant and at least they're corporate sponsors, meaning abiding some international laws, unlike the riches of your blood oil.

1155 2018-02-12 21:39:42 so what ?? we gave all the Iraqi oil to China. or did you forget ? or does that not suit your narrative ? my bet is Venezuela needs China and Russia because the US has used a trade blockade on them.
1156 2018-02-12 21:39:22 I love the smell of tea tree oil

1160 2018-02-12 21:39:09 Coconut oil is beautiful.
1161 2018-02-12 21:39:08 Rather than giving our natural resources away for free, not really a bad way to fund infrastructure. Anyone taking anything of value should pay, mining companies, oil & gas, spring water and grazing.

1163 2018-02-12 21:39:06 I used to use Rodan + Fields  Unblemish Acne treatment wash, clarifying toner and the oil control lotion. All are a bit pricey but really get the job done, and if you use only a small amt twice a day they will last you at least 6-12 months. But I just use ivory soap nowadays tbh
1164 2018-02-12 21:38:56 What the hell is wrong with a TA in Petros 2 to 4 hours to do a damn oil change waiting list
1165 2018-02-12 21:38:40 All I want for Valentine’s Day is an oil change
1166 2018-02-12 21:38:30 I swear, after an oil change, my car drives like heaven.
1167 2018-02-12 21:38:28 As long as the next roomnate doesn't: throw teabags away in the bathtub, throw up on our carpet, bang their s/o so loudly we can hear thru the ceiling, dump oil all over the kitchen, leave garbage bags for a week inside the house ......
1168 2018-02-12 21:38:22 Child... this is why I just pay extra to buy from larger brands and leave indies alone. I need my shit now. I’m not waiting on you to print out labels. Better use a permanent marker and write the name of the face oil on my bottle.

1173 2018-02-12 21:38:05 Omg! Thank you so much. It’s for my dissertation. So far, I’ve mainly been using “oil and British interests”. 

Trying to find other talking points/sources about factors that motivated British interests in the war (that’s not oil). 

Thank you so much.
1174 2018-02-12 21:38:05 According to OPEC MOMR, Venezuela's oil production decreased by 47.3 tb/d at 1.6 mb/d. Without saying, Venezuela contributed in OPEC oil production cut, of course they did not make that cut of one's own accord. Their economy is collapsing and oil production declining now. #OPEC

1182 2018-02-12 21:37:26 Really fun culinary fact: Canola oil got its name because at some point in history, a farmer decided “rapeseed oil” wasn’t tremendously marketable.
1183 2018-02-12 21:37:19 Because this isn't about a pipeline at all....it's about sailing 7 times more bitumen in oil tankers through a very difficult coastline, over a highly sensitive ecosystem with NOTHING in place should something go wrong. Who's grasping now?
1184 2018-02-12 21:37:10 If you’re looking for something to maintain your overall tone and prevent future spots, I would recommend the klairs freshly juiced vitamin C drops. It’s like a dry oil and feels so good on the skin and it’s super gentle and absorbent

1187 2018-02-12 21:36:56 How shocking that in an oil rich nation we have to highlight the struggles for families who are in poverty and even hungry regularly disgraceful Tory policies #BreadlineKids
1188 2018-02-12 21:36:55 Great, figure out what the effective rates need to be to cover the salary increase you’d like to see and go petition your representative. I would suggest looking into some spending cuts rather than tax increases so you don’t lose revenue when the gas and oil companies leave.
1189 2018-02-12 21:36:51 Venezuela was rich oil state with thriving economy. Then the “Socialist” Chavez took power on a Robin Hood platform offering free health care, welfare benefits, etc. The country went broke, he exacerbated the problem by nationalizing businesses, went more broke, then collapsed.
1190 2018-02-12 21:36:44 Ugh no free oil changes
1191 2018-02-12 21:36:36 Olbas oil in boiling water with towel over your head and inhale. Then lie on bed with your head hanging over the side for 10 minutes.... gives massive relief. Hope it works x
1192 2018-02-12 21:36:33 You mean ask the people of Venezuela about their corrupt government and how they are planning to give China and Russia control of their oil
1193 2018-02-12 21:36:33 Tell those two blokes in England to stop and rethink the map they’re carving out of the Ottoman Empire.  Oh, and buy oil stocks
1194 2018-02-12 21:36:27 I once read a sentence from someone who lived in Aberdeen, when asked why she voted yes she replied " because over there I see oil tankers and oil rigs, when I turn around I see food banks"

1204 2018-02-12 21:35:39 @xocult mj it is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanism of friendship .
1205 2018-02-12 21:35:37 If it is real truffle oil, and applied the right way, on the right food, it can be truly delightful. I do think restauranteurs have gotten a bit carried way with silly trends. We've had a serious spate of pork belly with artisanal aioli, up here in the OR.

1246 2018-02-12 21:29:35 You think manufacturers closed up shop in Ontario because Harper supported the oil sands? That makes no sense. 

Higher electricity prices in Ontario are directly attributable to Liberal policies. And high electricity prices make Ontario manufacturers less competitive.

1269 2018-02-12 21:27:08 Diffusing is not a common problem with essential oil diffusers, and since many diffusers offer a way to reduce output if necessary, you should be much more interested in which diffusers provide sufficient coverage.

We’ll have the live stream on @Colts.com
1286 2018-02-12 21:25:14 No consensus on the timeframe related to statute of limitations. Most do not support ED’s draft language. Lots of options provided to ED for consideration but none that garnered significant support. Someone upstairs (@usdoegov) will be burning the midnight oil tonight.

The good news is they won’t be calling this press conference off.
1294 2018-02-12 21:24:35 Clearly you didn't know that the oil and gas sector in #Alberta already shed thousands of jobs. it is affected strongly my world markets, and that bitumen tar sands is very toxic. @CPC_HQ are acting as if they and harper are still in charge. That is sad. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli

1298 2018-02-12 21:23:47 Comparing bitumen to diesel isn't going to make selling this here any easier if you look at the last non-responses to bunker oil spills in English Bay over the last few years. Do you have any proof or photos of this massive spill response equipment that is supposed to exist?

1320 2018-02-12 21:20:38 How about wind and solar on public lands instead of oil and gas.
1321 2018-02-12 21:20:28 I come from an area where nearby oil industry has definitely improved the general income of those living in the area. They provide good paying jobs. Business boomed.

1344 2018-02-12 21:17:40 There’s a reason why many spas have a distinctive smell — they’re using essential oils! Oils such as tea tree oil have been used for centuries to create the ambiance of a calm, safe place.
1345 2018-02-12 21:17:37 The real reason Albertans are losing it on #kindermorgan:

1) Oil firms (eg Shell) and investors say world shifting to EVs + renewables

2) Result is doom for #oilsands + existential crisis for AB

3) AB soothes its terror by blaming outsiders (enviros + First Nations)

1412 2018-02-12 21:11:16 Those who would give up essential The 4400, to purchase a little temporary Juror, deserve neither Oil heater nor Artificial photosynthesis.
1413 2018-02-12 21:11:10 Obama left the White House the same way the Iraqis left the oil fields, with a scorched earth retreat.
1414 2018-02-12 21:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: raw crust with spicy motor oil and philly beef.
1415 2018-02-12 21:10:54 Decided to adult today and get my oil changed... turned out to be free! Adulting win!! 
1416 2018-02-12 21:10:43 I used olive oil in my waffles by mistake. Inedible.
1417 2018-02-12 21:10:43 they’re even better if u put a teeny bit of peppermint oil on the mouth piece by the filter :/ lol
1418 2018-02-12 21:10:31 見回り行ってきまーす！
1419 2018-02-12 21:10:16 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
1420 2018-02-12 21:10:15 Where does the electricity come from? Wind? Coal?water?oil?...
1421 2018-02-12 21:10:09 I've been using a mix of witch hazel, water and lavender essential oil as a toner and its been very calming. African black soap has helped clear my skin, I use it at night now and a gentle milk cleanser in morning. Also I've heard avocado oil is better than coconut, doesn't clog
1422 2018-02-12 21:10:09 The @NJDevils have announced a trade:

Drew Stafford sent to Winnipeg for a Zamboni that’s dropping oil.
1423 2018-02-12 21:10:02 يعني ايه...؟
1424 2018-02-12 21:09:53 It's my birthday and I just spent $60 on renewing my license and $55 on an oil change. I was also told my battery needs to be replaced, which will cost about $160  I love being an adult.
1425 2018-02-12 21:09:52 Is the palmitate it contains from palm oil plantations? I avoid palm oil as  growth is destroying tropical forests, animals ecosystems and indigenous peoples.
1426 2018-02-12 21:09:47 Trying to debate on which essential oil I should use for this hyper-pigmentation
1427 2018-02-12 21:09:44 Why thank you ! Just wait for tomorrow pimped pancakes ahoy 
1428 2018-02-12 21:09:13 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1429 2018-02-12 21:09:13 Bulk Oil Storage and Transportation
1430 2018-02-12 21:09:08 
1431 2018-02-12 21:08:52 Whole tubers of yam and a keg of palm oil?
All that remain is tied red cloth.

1433 2018-02-12 21:08:44 Candidate Ejected From West Virginia House Floor for Listing Lawmakers’ Oil and Gas Donor...
1434 2018-02-12 21:08:38 It's incredible the depths that people like Pelosi will sink to entice people that her and her constituents exist to take care of the downtrodden, poor, and those who are mistreated. She is subpar snake oil salesman who conspires to satisfy her selfish needs of power and control
1435 2018-02-12 21:08:36 Great to see you investing 7 trillion in green energy bringing America in to the modern age...hiring millions of blue collar jobs...electricians to truck drivers...All while helping move us off oil & saving our environment..oh, wait that’s not what you meant...sad really. #Resist
1436 2018-02-12 21:08:34 DPRK is helping Nigeria establish a national healthcare system.
Cuba trains doctors around the world pro bono
The US and Europe extract oil and mineral wealth from Africa and give nothing in return, leaving it impoverished, how are these the same?
1437 2018-02-12 21:08:22 Eating a ham butty in bed crying cos I’ve put too much oil in my engine fuck off
1438 2018-02-12 21:08:12 His base doesn’t know how to research facts. He spews like a snake oil salesman. They think he’s smart with the biggest brain only because he says so. He just learned the word ‘trillion’ and tries to use it in every sentence.
1439 2018-02-12 21:08:08 I've had two phone calls from the dealer asking me to take a survey on my oil change. I think this answers my question on why it sometimes seems like everyone has an opinion on everything.
1440 2018-02-12 21:08:07 America planned to overthrow the leader of El Salvador. Why Bush the father and the son have sex there, the story of the Panama Canal and Iraq is oil and the wolves are deadly Why do wolves live that Iraq again
1441 2018-02-12 21:08:05 The soviets escalated it solely for the purpose of oil in the 80s, this entire cluster is insane.
1442 2018-02-12 21:08:02 Ahh yes, better know as the SELLING OFF OF AMERICA!
 To his corporate raider friends! New names for things  THE FOX NEWS AIR FORCE. THE PAPA JOHN 95, THE LUKE OIL NATIONAL OIL RESERVES ! THE TRUMP FORT KNOX ! And believe me it will be empty by the end of his presidency!@FoxNews
1443 2018-02-12 21:07:52 What I took out of this reading was the size of the steel and oil industry during the railroad growth and how much freedom the government gave to the RR builders #9outof313manifestsitsdestiny
1444 2018-02-12 21:07:50 THE INTERNET IS FULL OF A LOT OF CONTRADICTORY INFO AS TO HOW MUCH FISH OIL A PERSON SHOULD TAKE
1445 2018-02-12 21:07:40 The first question you should ask of any politician is if they take contributions from Wall Street, Oil or other rich corporations. If a candidate is popular, they should be getting grassroots donations, right? You don’t seem to respond to my questions. You bring up Trump instead
1446 2018-02-12 21:07:35 Hmmmmm@ghey look lush polly 
1447 2018-02-12 21:07:34 how to cook with oil without burning the house down
1448 2018-02-12 21:07:15 For good reason. Short-cutting on oil pipeline infrastructure will eventually kill some communities. Trump is a make a mess kind of guy who lets others clean up behind him. Sort of like a parade horse.
1449 2018-02-12 21:07:14 I am a robot. I piss oil
1450 2018-02-12 21:07:12 I’m not calling you or even many individual capitalists evil-the problem is the system. I’m sure plenty of oil oligarchs donate to Greenpeace in their spare time. But the problem is, if they were to try to actually put profit aside when running their businesses than they’d be out
1451 2018-02-12 21:07:11 Buying anointing oil for you
1452 2018-02-12 21:06:51 No lists please.
1453 2018-02-12 21:06:51 I forgot that the official Clinton portrait was a boring oil instead of the rippling, kinetic Chuck Close one.  Until today, official portraits lagged art history by about 150 years
1454 2018-02-12 21:06:42 Amazon is a monopoly, much like Standard Oil it uses its strength in one area to undercut competitors in another.
1455 2018-02-12 21:06:39 Canada should respond with an export tax on Hydro Electricity and crude oil.
1456 2018-02-12 21:06:25 China intends to launch yuan-denominated oil futures on March 26.
1457 2018-02-12 21:06:20 I'm gonna exfoliate tomorrow and throw some lemon oil on it tonight.
1458 2018-02-12 21:05:53 Started taking #CBD #oil regularly and I've had almost 0 #pain, #anxiety and I barely need my #insulin. What a miracle.

1460 2018-02-12 21:05:39 Oil of oregano, Golden seal, olive root, garlic . Use the liquid extracts instead of pills they work faster and it’s  natural.
1461 2018-02-12 21:05:30 My friend shut up and boil beans if you got nothing to do or say.

Its not the presence of oil thats the ish, its lack of leaders with just small common sense. 

Ur here making noise on social media everyday like molue way day traffic. Mtcheew in 36mil
1462 2018-02-12 21:05:30 This budget is a starting point for negotiations. The media is sensationalizing it to make $, you know, like a snake oil salesman or saleswoman. It’s not even a complete budget, it’s clearly a general starting point for negotiations. Also, since unemployment is at a record low
1463 2018-02-12 21:05:18 It smells like oil & other car parts in this place. Fucking stink. 
1464 2018-02-12 21:05:16 Defending multinational oil companies is not the same as defending #Canada's energy sector.  If it was, oil would be refined here in Canada and used as a business attractant, providing millions of jobs.  #CPC #fail #cdnpoli
1465 2018-02-12 21:05:13 Just spend $400 on my car  oil change and two new tires to make sure I don't die on my way to see @notthepretzels this weekend. #ihateadulting
1466 2018-02-12 21:04:49 Had not heard or read that she was a candidate for office.  Not sure that makes a difference though if she wasn't making derrogatory remarks about her opponent..I think she was simply calling out all the legislators who received gas/oil money.
1467 2018-02-12 21:04:41 Typical trump. Promise everything, deliver nothing “as promised”. Mexico pay for the wall, not! US pays then HOPE he can work out w/Mexico to pay, yea, right. Now infrastructure?? He’ll fix the roads & bridges, etc.... yep, as long as the States pay for it. Trump=snake oil sales!
1468 2018-02-12 21:04:37 Which then leads to our national parks to shrink in size, beaches become places to get oil which will lose $ for our economy. Yet coal and oil are damaging to the environment. Solar does not. Winning right?
1469 2018-02-12 21:04:34 I prefer the taste of butter so that’s why I use it but my friend exclusively uses oil and it cooks more evenly for him
1470 2018-02-12 21:04:32 Looks very tasty
Did you use much oil in it 
1471 2018-02-12 21:04:25 Just get me an oil change for Valentine’s Day
1472 2018-02-12 21:04:22 From all my research, it seems like I need to be taking like...at least six fish oil pills a day, if not more. This shit better revolutionize my life.
1473 2018-02-12 21:04:17 Yes mam , get the actual plant! Peel it & put the gel in a container! Use it for 5 days constantly and see how it works! I’m going to tell you about the tea tree oil , it’s a specific brand I use.
1474 2018-02-12 21:04:17 How much would a new oil burning central heating boiler be? Ball park? Anyone know?
1475 2018-02-12 21:04:17 @MichelleRempel why don't you and @CPC_HQ  stop whining, and deal the fact that BC doesn't want dirty Tar Sands.  Maybe #Alberta should diversify their economy instead of forcing pipelines on #Canada. We are not an oil production country. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
1476 2018-02-12 21:04:16 Haha....whatever...I got skillz...well I had skillz...nothing for me to knock the dust and oil up the knees...
1477 2018-02-12 21:04:15 Anything but gear oil, that stuff reeks.
1478 2018-02-12 21:04:12 I really want to know where I left my oil paints
1479 2018-02-12 21:04:10 May I point out that since the pipeline isn't going to be built anytime soon while the trade dispute is ongoing with BC then why would a company keep assets in the largest crude oil producer? I'd sell it and move onto a climate that would see a return than a dispute and loose $$$
1480 2018-02-12 21:04:07 Bob Mueller has been hailed by folks on BOTH sides of the aisle as being a standup guy.  Charlatans and snake oil salesmen like Hannity need to tear that down to support their own narrative.
1481 2018-02-12 21:03:55 Yeah guess they can sell the Zima of CBD oil to whoever. But those stores probably ran afoul of too strong or not labeled properly, etc.
1482 2018-02-12 21:03:34 Blazers vs Oil Kings for BC Family Day...Kamloops Insurance pre-game show @RadioNLNews at 1:30pm... Guests Don Hay, Jermaine Loewen and Edmonton coach Steve Hamilton.
1483 2018-02-12 21:02:58 Cutting programs and HEALTHCARE that cater to such issues, isn't #MAGA. It puts $ in the pockets that pay you to make it a reality. its like cutting redtape, for the pharmaceutical, oil, banks.  Which is that 1% and the inheritance tax beneficiary. How does that heal Americans?
1484 2018-02-12 21:02:42 Wallace said that oil and gas companies pay ad valorem? I was under the impression that gross production taxes were paid in lieu of ad valorem? #okleg
1485 2018-02-12 21:02:38 Palm oil is a disease of business on the environment and animals

1492 2018-02-12 21:02:22 Used money for new turkish suit to change gear oil today. 
1493 2018-02-12 21:02:08 Now all will be in one match. I assure you that Iran, like Iraq, has ended all the Arabs the same way, for oil will benefit, not the dance of Arra, nor Ivanka,
1494 2018-02-12 21:02:06 You are very delusional, so when you talk within context of what he did or said your arguement falls apart. Can you show me anything since the collapse of the Venezuela due to the oil price coming down of Corbyn saying any such thing?
1495 2018-02-12 21:01:53 vitimain E, olive oil, and castor oil can help

1497 2018-02-12 21:01:39 @lissalucas future house rep of West Virginia. How can we help defeat HB4268? If they’re going to accept oil money and commit to slandering the constitution, oust them

1500 2018-02-12 21:01:26 If in the West we are all supposed to be equal, why create a tiered entry price? I guess oil rich Arab tourists are low on disposible income. If the aim is to educate locals on Arabic cultural contributions, then shouldn't the discount been aplied to local Italians?
1501 2018-02-12 21:00:56 Scott Pruitt is used to living large off of payoffs from Big Oil that he received while serving as Oklahoma's Attorney General.  He sued the EPA 13 times in order to let them ruin our state so of course he made the perfect director for Trump to dismantle environmental safeguards.
1502 2018-02-12 21:00:54 How do you enjoy living in the corrupt, authoritarian, oil-and-gas state of Russia? While I appreciate whistle-blowing in general, your hypocrisy in taking shelter there is breath-taking.
1503 2018-02-12 21:00:48 we still have some peanut oil left over
1504 2018-02-12 21:00:47 Okay, so I used to work at @Valvoline in central Ohio. On our best day we would get 130 cars’ oil changes through on one Saturday. We’d have 3 in the bays and 9 out back with a wait no longer than 30 minutes...
1505 2018-02-12 21:00:40 Trump appears only to make money and war for oil and is unable to do the job. He should step aside and step down or be impeached. Let's see if Pence can carry out the needed skills and responibilities to secure the freedoms & safety of this country.His establishment is a failure.

1508 2018-02-12 21:00:30 @Food_Unwrapped Claimed reason for olive oil price rise is bugs and poor harvests. No mention of Brexit fall in £ increasing costs by 10% -15%! Half news!

1512 2018-02-12 21:00:14 Labour inherited the consequences of the ‘73 oil shock.  It tainted left-wing economic policies for a generation and gave us 40 years of Thatcherism.  The chaos of Brexit will bring a Decade of Discontent to whoever inherits this Moggist Mess.  It must be stopped
1513 2018-02-12 21:00:08 I call 100% unadulterated BULLSHIT on today’s press conference. Sarah Sanders is reading canned responses given to her at the podium to reply to questions they won’t answer truthfully. It’s so very sad that this we have a White House full of snake oil salesmen

1526 2018-02-12 20:57:56 Essential oil diffusers are quickly gaining popularity due to a growing interest in the health benefits of essential oils, as well as the fact that scented candles are not as safe as many once thought.
1527 2018-02-12 20:57:30 I just made it up. Fried some red onion & garlic in olive oil. Added haricot beans, tinned chopped tomatoes, mustard powder, rosemary, salt, pepper, honey, paprika, cumin, simmer.
1528 2018-02-12 20:57:24 true, then help we the people revoke the trump budget. sanders must also work to root out TRUMPS morally bankrupt support of the cia/israeli/big oil wars on syria & iran. Defund israel, Demilitarize and denationalize the united states police departments.
1529 2018-02-12 20:57:20 How about Obama and honor ? Yup it’s like oil n water just doesn’t mix it doesn’t go in same sentence 
1530 2018-02-12 20:57:16 It all depended on what you'd believed. NOI shouted and told us repeatedly Nigeria is not a rich country with oil. However, we got the potential to be among the richest in the world, minus oil. The current government lacks the capacity to launch us into global reckoning.

1537 2018-02-12 20:56:27 For those who want aromatherapy benefits and humidity, it is best to use an essential oil diffuser and a humidifier.

1539 2018-02-12 20:56:14 
1540 2018-02-12 20:56:08 C'mon, you know EXACTLY why!
1541 2018-02-12 20:56:06 Gulf Oil is also a sponsorship deal that gives the investor a return on their investment through marketing unlike Etihad who just plough money into City with no return on their investment as City have next to no marketing appeal since their fan base is so small.

1547 2018-02-12 20:55:14 Olive oil similar to whiskies just no single malts only blends #foodunwrapped
1548 2018-02-12 20:55:08 Ain’t nothing slick to a can of oil. Remember this.
1549 2018-02-12 20:55:06 Girls be darker than Akon talkin bout they mixed... With what? Oil and dirt?
1550 2018-02-12 20:55:00 Hard to believe this can happen in the United States of America, But there it is. Oil companies buy legislators and they arrest people who state that simple fact.
1551 2018-02-12 20:54:49 yeah! do highlights at first or something them slowly increase the amount of highlights you get, it takes time so maybe do coconut oil treatments and dont use heat in between your bleachings so your hair will stay somewhat healthy?
1552 2018-02-12 20:54:48 Why did drunk Cilla think it was okay to order a pizza from Harris Oil and not pick it up now I feel like I can’t order there again 
1553 2018-02-12 20:54:42 Hindi naman siya nakakapaso. Mas masarap para sa 'kin ang baby oil kasi mas madulas, saka sabi mo na rin nga, mainit, kaya para na ring may sumusubong mainit na bibig sa burat mo. 
1554 2018-02-12 20:54:37 Try to use tea tree oil & a natural Aloe plant!
1555 2018-02-12 20:54:34 You fry them in a pan with a little lemon and pepper and maybe garlic/garlic infused oil. If you’re doing the big Japanese ones you need to leave 1-2 min each side. Small ones like 30sec. Very simple.
1556 2018-02-12 20:54:31 Sweet. As a side note, hearing about oil from you is WAY better than all else in the news referencing it 
1557 2018-02-12 20:54:30 Ultrasonic diffusers work by vibrating the water in a way, it vaporizes into the air. Essential oils are mixed with the water, they are carried along with the water. Ultrasonic diffusers generate the vapor without any heat, which best preserves the integrity of essential oil.
1558 2018-02-12 20:53:59 really any jiffy lube will go down to 23-26$ if you look up oil change discounts, it should pop up
1559 2018-02-12 20:53:57 IR,make iran a big prison and EU eyes are closed by oil and dollars
1560 2018-02-12 20:53:51 Gulf Oil LP is a US based company 
1561 2018-02-12 20:53:47 The Middle East, genius. Or are you one of those people who thinks we didn't go over there for monetary gain by unnecessarily destroying cities near oil hotspots?
1562 2018-02-12 20:53:45 .@c59915979 Meanwhile, reality slips by un-noticed for you too it seems. a) Chavez used oil revenue to fund social & healthcare programmes. b) N.Korea is a dictatorship & a hermit nation, so no comparison. @Booze_Fags_Mags
1563 2018-02-12 20:53:44 had to take my adulting self today for an oil change.... I’m out here wylin lmao
1564 2018-02-12 20:53:30 Wow I’ve gone with mom to get her oil changed every time she’s gone in the past two years and she just tweeted that she’s doing it rn and I’m shook and crushed. I’m shitting on her yoga mat for sure today.
1565 2018-02-12 20:53:21 I agree. I was being sarcastic about Leafs. Oil don’t celebrate their history as much as Tor (thank god) and it isn’t as ancient. Hell, they were in a Game 7 in Finals this millennium.
1566 2018-02-12 20:53:14 I just use coconut oil now tbh! Use it twice a week and it works perfect. I get dermatitis on my hand so I use cannabis infused coconut oil on that, works wonders!
1567 2018-02-12 20:52:47 Først og fremmest skal der være et problem at gå op i. Standard Oil var med til at bringe prisen på olieprodukter derned, hvor alle mennesker kunne være med. Og der kunne læses og dygtiggøres om aftenen. Det er ikke stort klogere, det Margrethe Vestager har gang i.
1568 2018-02-12 20:52:26 What about Trump hotel in Baku. All very suspicious. He is a snake oil salesman
1569 2018-02-12 20:52:20 My plan was to work on this as a series of oil paintings between other things. So there is a definite strong maybe to your question. I'm planning to keep it fun and zero expectations though as I need more work like that in my life! THANK YOU FOR ASKING WOW!
1570 2018-02-12 20:52:15 I believe "assessment growth" is the lamp oil in this analogy.
1571 2018-02-12 20:52:11 I managed to squeeze a half glass of wine when I took the bag out of the box. And there's leftover popcorn my housemate made with olive oil. I was pissed off at him for using my expensive organic Greek olive oil, but it really tastes great :)
1572 2018-02-12 20:52:07 #ipweek2018 An important fixture in the diaries of all oil and petchems traders. Please book a visit at our offices on New Oxford St, for a no obligation demonstration of AspectCTRM!  #crude #gasoline #gasoil #OOTT #Position
1573 2018-02-12 20:52:04 What’s the point of scheduling an appointment for an oil change if I still gotta wait 2 hours for this shit to be done?
1574 2018-02-12 20:52:03 طبعا لا ياعلى
1575 2018-02-12 20:51:52 "Natural Skin Care Experts": Just put coconut oil and lemon juice on your face!
People: *crying in a corner, hiding face because of hyperpigmentation caused by chemical burns and acne scars caused by lemon juice and oil*
1576 2018-02-12 20:51:46 For added nutritional kick, blend whey powder and MCT oil into your favorite nut butter (unless you're vegan of course, in which case have a nice day)
1577 2018-02-12 20:51:46 We'll def have better infrastructure. Oil money(<2.5 million bbl/d)  although easy to get is highly insufficient  for 180 million people
1578 2018-02-12 20:51:38 @dan_bernstein Try safflower oil to make popcorn in a pot. It's nice and light and difficult to burn the popcorn.
1579 2018-02-12 20:51:23 I can’t believe my oil change is almost $90
1580 2018-02-12 20:51:23 One tip I learned from my half Italian ex is that you should always salt the water really heavily before cooking pasta and also there is a step where you add some olive oil too (but I was drunk for 2/3 of our relationship so that last point could be a lie)
1581 2018-02-12 20:51:16 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
1582 2018-02-12 20:51:16 How do you people fry your pancakes? Olive oil seems daft.
1583 2018-02-12 20:51:11 Wow...great interview.  Focusing on my social wealth and it’s said here first: oil shortage in couple of years.
1584 2018-02-12 20:51:08 Hey Oscar!  I stay with granny for the night. Mom is home alone due to an self-help group appointment! Feeling okay these days. Had a bath against my scale. Seems a bit better. Mom ordered evening primrose oil to better it. We'll see if it helps. Can be summer again!!!
1585 2018-02-12 20:50:30 B.A Linguistics, would love to work in an Oil and Gas firm or any other Company , as an administrator
1586 2018-02-12 20:50:24 And I ALWAYS had the aromatherapy popping in my space! Be it with an oil burner or incense or candles fixed with oil. Scent was and still is a major key for my relaxation.
1587 2018-02-12 20:50:20 I’ve felt so much relief now that I’ve sold my old car & got a new one. No more oil problems 
1588 2018-02-12 20:50:13 “I say Leo, I don’t know why we didn’t think to eat them before. Say, would you consider cooking them in some ground nut oil, with a little garlic butter next time?”
1589 2018-02-12 20:50:06 I've tried Tea Tree Oil and it didn't help
1590 2018-02-12 20:49:51 WOW! well Donald, have looked at how the US addresses the fisheries on the east coast, the softwood lumber issue, oil purchases, trade disputes, to name a few?
1591 2018-02-12 20:49:49 We're not going to run out, because of increased capital investment. In terms of EROEI, Peak Oil is pretty accurate.

The limits to growth argument includes the problem of increased capital requirements, which makes food system unsustainable on inputs, never mind pollution.
1592 2018-02-12 20:49:49 Teen girl was pregnant before her father did. Fascinating look at olive oil the same idea.
1593 2018-02-12 20:49:46 As far as what trade action is next if BC doesn’t back down, Premier @RachelNotley isn’t saying, but she says the plan is to not harm Albertans with action. So, that probably rules out turning off the oil taps to the coast. #ableg
1594 2018-02-12 20:49:43 You left out "petroleum grifter and US Gov't freeloader. Between taking money from big oil and taking plane rides and trips on the public dime he's become as dirty and corrupt as most of the other "swamp-things" in the Trump administration. Pruitt is openly cynical of the EPA.
1595 2018-02-12 20:49:33 Rep. Kevin Wallace, a Lincoln Co Repub, says oil and gas companies didn't steamroll others in Step Up Oklahoma coalition. Says they don't want the tax doubled on their production.
1596 2018-02-12 20:49:32 I’ve been putting off getting my oil changed.... but I think it’s time
1597 2018-02-12 20:49:20 OMG. Found my lemon candy from last pregnancy.  Took one and feel SO much better! Lemon and lemon oil are soooo great. For now at least: no nausea and no heartburn.
1598 2018-02-12 20:49:04 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
1599 2018-02-12 20:48:44 Mainit sa titi ang baby oil
1600 2018-02-12 20:48:37 Ur head get oil!!! Nice one
1601 2018-02-12 20:48:26 In a long question, Rep. Perryman (D) is basically accusing Republicans and oil/gas interests of pushing the @StepUpOklahoma plan to avoid a proposed state question that would put GPT to 7% for all wells #okleg
1602 2018-02-12 20:48:19 I never promote products I don’t back 100% - but my skin has legit felt like silk since I started using @KORAORGANICS Noni Glow oil.
1603 2018-02-12 20:48:06 Ah, the phrase that should have set off the snake oil klaxon - "guaranteed return"  #BBCPanorama
1604 2018-02-12 20:48:06 Idk what sign this is but for the past few weeks I pick up my phone and look at the time it's 4:44am
1605 2018-02-12 20:48:06 Awesome win, I watched it last night. Great to see you are still on your game.
1606 2018-02-12 20:48:05 we went and saw our cat that’s not our cat after he got fixed and they shaved his tail because it was full of oil and grease and it couldn’t get clean, and they shaved the side of his face where he was cut. AND HE STILL LOOKED SO HANDSOME and i cried SO hard. his tiny cone 
1607 2018-02-12 20:47:57 Not only am I now debt free but I also got an oil change and new windshield wipers #adulting so hard
1608 2018-02-12 20:47:56 How about coal, gas or oil
1609 2018-02-12 20:47:38 Midnight Oil - Beds are Burning
1610 2018-02-12 20:47:36 So I haven't had an oil change in over a year because Im a dumbass! So now I gotta pray this new oil breaks it all up. Lol here's hoping.
1611 2018-02-12 20:47:29 I'm trying to be all healthy and holistic, but dude - I  can't stand the smell of coconut oil.
1612 2018-02-12 20:47:25 That's exactly what Trumpolini wants to do. Share the middle East with his buddy Putin and take everybody's oil. Bullshit man. #IMPEACH
1613 2018-02-12 20:47:06 Ladies & Men im going to put you on to a BLACK women who has and created her own Oil . . . . . That has been tested and it’s also for dandruff and moisture and she’s well educated on the study of OUR hair
1614 2018-02-12 20:46:31 No b only u my sister
1615 2018-02-12 20:46:30 @restorationhard I have the farmhouse table, what oil do you suggest using on it to best maintain and preserve it?
1616 2018-02-12 20:46:27 ELLOS SABEN QUE VENEZUELA ESTA NADANDO EN PETROLEO, MUCHO MAS QUE EN TODOS LOS PAISES ARABES RICOS EN PETROLEO! EL ECUADOR PERDIO EL ORIENTE ECUATORIANO JUSTO  EN MEDIO DE LA 2NDA. GUERRA MUNDIAL! QUIENES FUERON GARANTES DE ESE ENTUERTO? REVISEN LA HISTORIA!THE REASON?OIL!
1617 2018-02-12 20:46:19 UPDATE: My "yoga pants" are running pants. I can't find the oil. I still have lots of whatnot though. See you in 15 x
1618 2018-02-12 20:46:11 This is like when an unsigned amateur goalie gets the call from the oil rig that he's needed to be the emergency bench goalie for one game and then goes back to that rig, except Michael is the goalie that finds a roster spot for the rest of his life. Congrats you two!
1619 2018-02-12 20:45:55 Nothing worse than massage oil in your freshly washed hair 
1620 2018-02-12 20:45:49 Using coconut oil for new tattoo just makes me feel like I should be cooking myself. ~_~
1621 2018-02-12 20:45:42 Putting up an Oil rig?
1622 2018-02-12 20:45:39 @LeeTracy100 From the top of the Sam Houston Ship Channel Bridge, more than 50 meters (160 ft) above Buffalo Bayou, in every direction you look, you can see huge oil tankers, massive piles of coal, and uncountable smokestacks. This small corner of Houston is 1234567891234567890-0
1623 2018-02-12 20:45:33 CNN will never stop lying to support Dems & Democrats will not stop protecting CNN just because of oil money they eat from Africa countries
1624 2018-02-12 20:45:23 Let's hope you can seal that huge oil deal and let's get out of these trips for good... wealth will smile on us pretty soon $hpnn #CannabisCommunity #cbdoil #stocks
1625 2018-02-12 20:45:20 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

*Oil change light comes on

My life
1629 2018-02-12 20:45:04 The dentist injected clove oil into my wisdom tooth wound at 1.30pm and over 7 hours later I can still taste it  most disgusting taste in the world 
1630 2018-02-12 20:44:56 You can always count on MCT oil to clear you up.
1631 2018-02-12 20:44:51 Muka is very tall and if his horns happen to hit an oil lantern and it falls next to a tankard of ale and much fire ensues but he feels very bad about it, then who could call that an alignment change amirite
1632 2018-02-12 20:44:20 I'm not sure if that lad has ever been to the bog in his life. Defintely looks like more of an oil heating type of guy. #notions

1634 2018-02-12 20:44:04 for the past month, I’ve been using witch hazel & coconut oil on my face 
1635 2018-02-12 20:44:02 Hm. I'm working with a recipe that's two parts sugar to one part egg whites. I know it's not egg yolk or oil. We've tried it three times and it stays, well, marshmallowy.
1636 2018-02-12 20:44:01 I love how y'all underestimate me...i have done it enough to be a pro...and i know which oil is best for your skin type... "happy endings" are at a premium tho... $21

1640 2018-02-12 20:43:11 Chef Louis cut up some carrots, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with toothpaste.
1641 2018-02-12 20:43:03 MacT watched Sabres-Bruins with Johnson in nets. Zemgus also a player of intrigue for Oil. Size, speed, grit, some scoring.
1642 2018-02-12 20:42:59 I got that after a girl raved about it on YouTube lol but I haven’t perfected my wash and go so idk the big difference on that and the olive oil one
1643 2018-02-12 20:42:43 Diy lip scrub: equal parts caster sugar and coconut oil (say 1tbs each) and then a squeeze of honey (say 1 tsp). Flavour with vanillla essence
1644 2018-02-12 20:42:33 It’s fact which completely discounts all my mentioned points. Misnomer; who is “our”?  if you’re referring to Cdns, it’s not “our” energy or “our” product. If you’re referring to your big oil employer then yes, it’s yours.
1645 2018-02-12 20:42:16 They have disappeared. Still have two kids in the car park in a car with no oil. This is dangerous and unacceptable. Please contact the local depot. As a travel writer hire cars all over the world and never been treated like this before. Please sort now.
1646 2018-02-12 20:42:15 Years ago I worked offshore with fishermen who had converted to oil & gas

They loved the Union and 'Rangers' so much they had never ever been to Ibrox. Anybody south of Fraserburgh was a 'traitor'. When I pointed out Rangers were from Glasgow they said 'all the others are poofs'
1647 2018-02-12 20:42:12 I respectfully disagree with that last part: the Club of Rome type of analysis has held up worst in that regard.  Peak Oil, for instance: if we really do nothing about global warming we're not going to run out but instead keep raising average temperature
1648 2018-02-12 20:41:59 Have you? because it's right in the summary of the bill "The bill provides that use and development of oil and gas mineral property that has been consented to by three fourths of the oil and gas owners is permissible, is not waste, and is not a trespass."
1649 2018-02-12 20:41:53 Why is it always about the money Christi? Texas should be most interested in safe, clean renewable energies. Shipping oil by train isn't safe and has caused major destruction but, it is cheaper. Is that what you mean by "energy prosperity"?
1650 2018-02-12 20:41:48 aloe vera is the new coconut oil
1651 2018-02-12 20:41:37 Turning off the oil would be further than Notley sees this spat going #ableg

1655 2018-02-12 20:41:11 as a youngster it def is difficult to manage anything on your own if it involves money. I can only offer to order some omega 3 oil capsules for like 15€ or so and just hope it helps, by even just a tiny bit? sucks to be you I guess??? Fuck man
1656 2018-02-12 20:41:09 I love my oil diffuser. Ive got a messy room, tangled hair, laundry to hang and still haven’t gotten dressed with towel on head... Just add patchouli, lavender and lemongrass. Things seem to be doing better now

1660 2018-02-12 20:40:56 @marissalonso__ We're definitely glad to know you're saving money! We just want to let you know not all oil changes are the same!
1661 2018-02-12 20:40:48 no, Natives respect & honor the land/peace treaties that were signed, but the settler gov doesn't. It is the gov that allows supremacists to run the system & get away with murder. Theyve colluded with mining,oil&pipeline corps, used rcmp & so called justice system against natives

1665 2018-02-12 20:40:21 more completions to take advantage of higher oil prices
1666 2018-02-12 20:40:12 Family Nutrition: Mountain Dew this February? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.

1673 2018-02-12 20:39:43 Oops I guess you can't refute those claims. I guess either, you're not as smart as you thought or you've been mislead by a manipulating and corrupt snake oil salesman
1674 2018-02-12 20:39:14 Oil money
1675 2018-02-12 20:39:01 The largest blame for manufacturing dying in the East, is Harper putting all of his priorities on oil, in the West. No investments in manufacturing East. Hydro's problem in Ontario, was coal, the cost to update to renewables, amongst other things.
1676 2018-02-12 20:38:59 i think the 2 others are the olive oil mask and olive oil scrub but i could be wrong. just going off the descriptions and ingrediants xxx
1677 2018-02-12 20:38:49 Also, soaking in

And flooding with

1678 2018-02-12 20:38:45 Needed an oil change so bad so finally getting one and of course gonna be late from lunch lol
1679 2018-02-12 20:38:38 Hey Mister! The oil stike is most powerful! That will get the attention! Thank God!
1680 2018-02-12 20:38:37 He's a mafia don for Russian oil oligarchy & any true conservative is appalled. But they still own him. They could have risen up at GOP convention & said no. They didn't.
Max Boot had a good piece abt his awakening. I've read others. Rubin, Navarro.... but they clearly oppose DT.
1681 2018-02-12 20:38:34 Not surprising. Obviously, Big Oil has more power than the public. I will continue to fight for renewables to attempt to stop the environmental destruction before it is too late, if it isn't already. Thank you for all you do.
1682 2018-02-12 20:38:17 Hash well my hand slipped into the oil as I was cleaning it
1683 2018-02-12 20:38:06 Sort of! I got all my clothes packed and some special food stuff that Rob doesn't eat (like almond flour, coconut oil, etc).I'll pack everything else Thursday night/Friday morning
1684 2018-02-12 20:37:47 Gotta love Ted! He catches #Trumps games!

This is all about oil & ruble

Can't wait for the day he is out and he is behind bars.

1686 2018-02-12 20:37:41 When they finish all the food now they will start eating spag & palm oil.

1688 2018-02-12 20:37:30 No we’re at Tenerife South Airport. Have not even left yet. We insisted they check oil after trying to fob us off. Now they are messing about getting us a replacement. Please contact them ASAP. We are in Bay 60, driver Jennifer McKelvie. Two tired & stressed kids.
1689 2018-02-12 20:37:27 use some coconut oil. put it on a cotton pad and it’ll help loosen the glitter glue

1697 2018-02-12 20:35:49 Where is ISIS? Another money play from USA. There must be oil or valuable mines somewhere out there. Bloodsucker USA chasing new targets as always.
1698 2018-02-12 20:35:33 Never heard of them  #keepitindie 
1699 2018-02-12 20:35:30 The other point is CCS is known to be too expensive unless it's used for enhanced oil extraction. So the basis runs from denial, to promoting a present non-solution, to resulting in said non-solution generating more of the problem (ghg emissions).
1700 2018-02-12 20:35:29 Jeremy Corbyn and John McDowell have made it clear they intend to kill off nuclear industry.

The article was quite specific wind solar tidal only. No mention of nuclear no onshore oil & gas

Anyone that works in Engineering needs to vote Concervative
1701 2018-02-12 20:35:22 First time at @BIBIBOPGrill and I’m in love!!! So glad they use Canola oil so I can eat here, so nice. New favorite that will be a splurge day regular!
1702 2018-02-12 20:35:13 Also a significant number of BC resident's that work in Alberta oil patch ,or use too.
1703 2018-02-12 20:34:48 I can assure you that an oil spill of that magnitude in the Gulf of Mexico will affect the entire gulf coast, including Florida.
1704 2018-02-12 20:34:45 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1705 2018-02-12 20:34:41 Slathering my face in coconut oil as my skin is suffering.

I smell like a bounty. Form a queue
1706 2018-02-12 20:34:41 Wallace assuring that wind companies won't pack up and go because of increased taxes.

During Special Session 1, though, many lawmakers were insistent that tax increases on oil producers would drive them outta the state.

1708 2018-02-12 20:34:19 Apparently my car wasn't getting oil pressure because it had no oil in it..

I do feel stupid for not checking the oil before bringing it to the shop.

But I feel even more stupid for assuming Firestone would put oil in my car when they charged me for my recent oil change
1709 2018-02-12 20:34:12 This tea tree oil STINKS

1715 2018-02-12 20:33:08 Yeah people in that position have already investigated every snake oil remedy including literal snake oil. My anecdotal remark is unhelpful and people get nasty when you tell them you don’t want their advice.
1716 2018-02-12 20:33:07 Great leg #workout earlier this evening with a protein shake and a super-#healthy stir-fry (light on the oil) to top it off...added to the fact I *almost* achieved everything I had planned today, and #Monday hasn't been too bad! #fitness #gym #gymtime #gymming #legday #gymrat
1717 2018-02-12 20:33:06 @MowersGalore North Geelong what a bunch of condescending pri.ks Ater going there last Tuesday with my mower leaking oil.  Heads up to the two guys behind  my back smirking. I rather stick my foot under my mower than go back to MG NG
1718 2018-02-12 20:33:04 Say good bye to Panama Alabama connection for your pills and crank. West side of Florida is where the drugs come in. No #Oil drilling there and nobody to see anything.  You f**** took everything from me & now it's my turn...legally of course #Bannon #RoyMoore u too @NancyPelosi
1719 2018-02-12 20:32:46 New oil, new transmission fluid, filters, leaky gasket repaired, new spark plugs and wires, new door handle, car's gotten a lot of work done on it as of late, I hope she appreciates it~
1720 2018-02-12 20:32:45 Maar dan moet je nu oil zeggen dat hij bij een andere partij zit
1721 2018-02-12 20:32:44 That’s bc lying snake oil salesman @AdamSchiffCA put methods and sources (like how FBI retrieve and what secret procedures were used to obtain this info)   (We don’t want our enemies to know) into their memo knowing @POTUS team must deduct them
1722 2018-02-12 20:32:44 #MI6 were proud of their “strategy”. They did play up the oil too but mainly by saying that somewhere like Venezuela could be next
1723 2018-02-12 20:32:40 @MartinSLewis we always buy tins:chopped toms,kidney beans etc coconut milk & cooking oil from world food aisle.Bags of spices are the best value £0.50 for 250g bag #martinlewis

1725 2018-02-12 20:32:21 @thermaebathspa had a lovely visit to the spa today - in the Minerva bath is there an aromatherapy oil or scent added, smelled so nice like geranium, it would be great to know, thanks! :-)
1726 2018-02-12 20:32:08 Combining Canadian and US production, we'll be close to oil independent soon.  Most Canadian crude can only tap the US market and Congress could renew the export ban if global supplies got tight, making global pricing irrelevant at least in the medium term.

1729 2018-02-12 20:31:43 Fuel up to K14/ltr come on guys, oil prices are at an all time low but you decided to increase. In the the past 3 years oil prices have dropped by nearly 40% and we have had 4 increments.

1736 2018-02-12 20:31:06 Ha ha ha ha how's that? Trump doubles down on obsolete technology like oil & gas, while cutting funding for retrainning!!! Sounds like a recipe for more pain. But again you had nice alternative facts
1737 2018-02-12 20:31:01 This is about a small ignorant minority, that will not listen to facts. Canadian oil, Canadian Jobs. The real losers are the BC people that will never see the benefits of resource jobs. Thousands of people work in oil and gas that will lose their jobs because of no investment.

1739 2018-02-12 20:30:43 But I need my rosehip oil lol
1740 2018-02-12 20:30:42 I spent 5 minutes trying figure out what OLIVE oil was made out of and I saw a picture of an olive and said “oh olive oil is made out of grapes” and I’ve never had such a tough 5 minutes of my life

1745 2018-02-12 20:30:11 Did an hour overtime and car died 12 miles from house. Heating isn't working at home, possible leak in oil line. Dropped my dinner in the kitchen. Been a bad day.
1746 2018-02-12 20:30:03 What is your opinion of @cathmckenna slandering oil and coal workers as rapists? Are you not seeing a trend here?
1747 2018-02-12 20:30:00 Anyone who doesn't know it is about Golan Heights oil and more is out of the loop.

1749 2018-02-12 20:29:55 Nah look closer it’s your beloved Killary undressed. Put an apple in her mouth, salt and pepper with olive oil and she ready for the oven
1750 2018-02-12 20:29:49 Pitiful. What a spoiled child. I saw grapes in the store; California, but I chose the ones from Mexico. Travel? Don’t want to get questioned by ICE. Oil? You get a special price. We will be selling to China. America First? America Alone.
1751 2018-02-12 20:29:41 I need a hot oil treatment in my scalp. 
1752 2018-02-12 20:29:23 Well the packaging says it has wheat flour, sugar, oil... Sooo cookie?
1753 2018-02-12 20:29:21 @JANewsNetwork @AndrewHolnessJM ,, 5,) Coconut oil in Combination with Maize and Sugar Alcohol, Jamaica could make maybe a own fuel? And among other the Maize and Sugarcane waste they could take for the Pig Breeding? Alcohol for Antifreeze for Cars,or Car window cleaner medium?
1754 2018-02-12 20:29:17 I have a Canadian Passport not a BC one.  If Land-locking Canadian oil so American companies can profit from reduced prices is not treason I don't know what it #cdnpoli #abpoli #bcpoli
1755 2018-02-12 20:29:15 Coconut Oil is massively cheaper in the world food aisle. I’ve seen it 100% cheaper in some shops. Different brand but same item #martinlewis
1756 2018-02-12 20:29:00 The USA Government at this point really uses the tactic "let's take their oil" as they don't want to leave the oil fields, the oil fields in Syria are still under US occupation.
1757 2018-02-12 20:29:00 Who is behind the oil grab in the middleast? Genie Energy  Exxon  Chevron or Russia maybe Rothchild and crew.
1758 2018-02-12 20:28:53 Nah no worries. I couldn’t draw and now I can sell my oil paintings. I’m going to enjoy following you
1759 2018-02-12 20:28:38 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1760 2018-02-12 20:28:33 I found out why Canadians are so obsessed with their maple syrup.. turns out a single barrel of that shit goes for about $1,800 that’s almost 30x the cost for a barrel of oil. These people are sitting on a goddamn delicious gold mine.
1761 2018-02-12 20:28:21 @JANewsNetwork @AndrewHolnessJM ,, 4,) I think Jamaica knows, that Jamaica can also buy Maize from the USA, Brazil, Mexico ? To can make many Maize Products ? Maize germ oil,Maize starch, Maize flour, Cornflakes, Maize syrup, Maize Bread, Nachos and so on ?
1762 2018-02-12 20:27:58 I am a guy but I wanna intrude and ask please. How safe it is to go down on a healthy v daaidaai during lento? And is it true that Olive Oil down there is good also for stuff like Yeast Infections. Askies I wanna know. #TheGameChanger @YFM
1763 2018-02-12 20:27:54 public lands don't belong to the government, they belong to tax payers. The cleanup will cost more than any oil/ gas $
1764 2018-02-12 20:27:43 I think @jolly_osadiaye  has a point here. Norway's windfall was saved in a sovereign wealth fund so that the future generation will reap the reward of owning crude oil. That fund has resulted in investment in over 9000 companies. It actually resulted in higher productivity.
1765 2018-02-12 20:27:38 biz Norveçte yaşıyoruz,  kışın hergün mutlaka, cod liver oil - omega 3-epa-dha alıyoruz, onun hakkında birşeye rastladınız mı?

1768 2018-02-12 20:27:31 Exactly! Why have we interfered for decades in the middle east? Oil, control, paybacks in the form of political contributions... such a scam from both political parties... who have served their Saudi masters and not the American people.
1769 2018-02-12 20:27:28 And there are 30 employees funded by big oil in the British wind lobby and similar numbers in every country worldwide. Greenspin funded by Russian Soros with massive funding. The Chiinese funded UEA. etc.

And we know precisely how much Heartland got - because Gleich published it
1770 2018-02-12 20:27:21 I finally ordered the anodized/oil slick pocket knife I've been wanting for years and I'm fuckin pumped
1771 2018-02-12 20:27:16 What did you invest in Middle east ???more than killing people to get the OIL , as what you are doing in Syria now , by bombing few Asad forces and killed 100 of them so you can take control of the Biggest GAS and OIL field
,don't try to play victim and spread 
 fake news
1772 2018-02-12 20:27:16 about 12 years ago i had a neighbor who hated me because i threw an on fire pot of vegetable oil into his yard. it was supposed to go on my patio but i was panicking so i missed
1773 2018-02-12 20:27:13 So I’m getting my oil changed and buddy comes out the room and says, “do you call that hair style the mushroom” I couldn’t even be mad dawg 
1774 2018-02-12 20:27:12 FLASHBACK : May 17, 2016
Zambian Government delegation led by H.E ECL arrived in Saudi Arabia ,amongst highlights was Oil deal that would see cost of fuel drop to as low as K5.5. per litre.Negotiations had been ongoing & deal executed.
FAST FORWARD 12th February 2018?
1775 2018-02-12 20:27:11 Just watched a maintenance guy shotgun oil into a machine  Efficient at every level
1776 2018-02-12 20:26:44 Doesn't reduction in oil prices help temper inflation? It would seem that a significant increase trickles throughout transportation supply chains worldwide as well as siphoning individual spending away from discretionary purchases into a "commodity"
1777 2018-02-12 20:26:38 The 45q tax credit appears to be used exclusively for enhanced oil recovery. CCS isn’t the outcome of so called CCS policies. Just another handout to the oil industry.
1778 2018-02-12 20:26:35 Wallace notes an elephant in the building about Plan A+ that fell five votes shy in November: "I believe if oil and gas would have been on board, I believe it would have passed." Notes that Step Up version is less friendly to #OilAndGas, which is accurate. #okleg
1779 2018-02-12 20:26:32 I've literally only gotten my oil changed once. I've had my car since November 2016.  I really don't dive much at all. My car has less than 8500 miles on it.
1780 2018-02-12 20:26:31 Hell, you can just go back to 2016 election with Trump saying we should have "taken" Iraq's oil
sigh
1781 2018-02-12 20:26:25 Blah blah blah.... I am not a shill for oil industry that's for sure....

1783 2018-02-12 20:26:11 But......but.....5 YEAR AVERAGE!!!! lol....... How long did that lunatic narrative last? hahahaha
1784 2018-02-12 20:26:06 Um... How are you analyzing the vote w/o auditing for accuracy? Do you just stare at the voting machine or the results?

Auditing is not meant to fix problem, it's meant to identify it. Just saying machines are flawed w/ no evidence is the snake oil salesman

1789 2018-02-12 20:25:41 I don’t plan on having this car for more than two years, and that’s about when my warranty runs out, it even covers the oil changes,   so I’m good, it’s the tires that they don’t pay for (that’s my worry)

1794 2018-02-12 20:25:14 right. i've just already seen the Fox News brigade making fun of it for not being a boring-ass old oil painting photo realistic representation. i think i like hers better than his actually though they're both fantastic.
1795 2018-02-12 20:25:01 I LOVE Malaysia. The wildlife there is severely underrated. Unfortunately, their palm oil industry is also killing most of it. #travelpics

1801 2018-02-12 20:24:26 Almost all British cars leak oil

1807 2018-02-12 20:23:47 Lol.  No true Scotsman. Ignore the evils of communism and pretend it's never been done right.  Not realising the problem isn't communism, it's that the human spirit and communism are oil and water.
1808 2018-02-12 20:23:40 Democrats will try to do every thing to protect CNN, & CNN will do every thing to protect Democrats just because of oil money from Africa

1812 2018-02-12 20:22:58 Another story of Big Oil lobbyists buying votes in Congress. They are just one of many but when do we decide enough is enough? Is this OUR America or Corporate America? It’s ridiculous! #lobbyunmasked #lobbying #BigOil #Fracking #Congress #VoteBlue2018 ##Resistance #FlipItBlue
1813 2018-02-12 20:22:49 Yes I know, but now med night and store was closed so used what available in my kitchen 
1814 2018-02-12 20:22:40 Man they always be trying that shit. 

Basically them: Well if you get regular oil your car will explode and you’ll die. 

Me: Well I’ll take my chances thanks
1815 2018-02-12 20:22:37 Enhanced Oil Recovery. They were going to get the oil out anyway & if it this is one way of given them tax breaks, why not?
1816 2018-02-12 20:22:30 Walmart is saving my ass today. I had bronchitis prescriptions and needed an oil change. Now I’m almost set to go back to campus.
1817 2018-02-12 20:22:25 I was thinking the same thing.
1818 2018-02-12 20:22:25 I really just want an oil change for valentine's day.

1822 2018-02-12 20:21:14 I'm getting an oil change and this guy is acting like I can't afford the royal treatment for my princess. Probably can't even buy your girl a McDouble, shut up

1827 2018-02-12 20:21:04 I got back to Abk this afternoon and Mum decided to gv me punishment by gvn me 50meats to fry ... 

I don't like meat tho, fish is my fav. 

I tot it was a joke until I started sweating in the kitchen. Jeeeez!!! 

The fear of hot oil... Chef and real ladies unna dey try ooo.
1828 2018-02-12 20:21:03 Suffering this wisdom tooth pain. Been popping Naproxen like skittles, doing all the salt water rinses and coconut oil pulls.
1829 2018-02-12 20:20:44 Oh, and the complimentary internet was disconnected, again. 1.5hrs for an oil change? Ridiculous.
1830 2018-02-12 20:20:35 جاني صداع ونوم
1831 2018-02-12 20:20:33 I need like, an oil drum of this.
1832 2018-02-12 20:20:30 Perhaps that's b/c if one looks at the growth in US shale & the growth in "OPEC Unplanned Production Outages" from 2011-present, one could be left with the impression that the US State Dept & even military has played a role in creating an "oil supply vacuum" that shale filled...
1833 2018-02-12 20:20:23 What you do not understand is that oil is NO LONGER actually a commodity. As with coffee, we now very much care where it comes from. As with weapons or toxins or poisons, we now very much care how they are used.

#Dilbit for lubricants? Great. To burn in ICE? Must end.

1835 2018-02-12 20:20:22 I made this pizza with sweet and sour pork and chopped garlic over Stilton on Zaatar and olive oil and called it 'Moroccan Communion' because it also has unleavened crust.
1836 2018-02-12 20:20:21 I used coconut oil to cook this chicken stew and I'm impress with how well I can taste the coconut as if I used coconut milk. It's yummy & a good way to turn down the spice.
1837 2018-02-12 20:20:19 in the bed gossiping wit my granny and forgot I had to go get my oil changed 
1838 2018-02-12 20:20:02 Well put ... my fiance and I enjoy Edward Abbey and love the Big Bend. Those rough trails & amazing views often lead to amazing photos and stunning oil paintings.  The brush captures the soul of the Big Bend well ...

1840 2018-02-12 20:19:56 The UK call the lack of gas/elec/coal/oil 'fuel' poverty. Everyone else in the EU & world energy poverty. Anyone would think we were trying to make it sound like not enough petrol in a car?
1841 2018-02-12 20:19:37 This was a simple oil change, customer waiting. Advisor decides to take his lunch. My car is ready and I have to hunt down someone so I can leave. The advisor was an asshole.

1845 2018-02-12 20:19:02 @GenJohnKelly ive sent messages to POTUS but i'm sure never seen, sent resume to WH offered 2 work for free, i'm 64 semi-retired, (was consultant in Oil&Gas Ind 40 years) have many great ideas re:infrustructure, if U have any interest id love 2 share, but dont intend 2 bother you
1846 2018-02-12 20:18:42 I would love to see the 'poll' the gas & oil companies said people supported them. I would love to hear from those citizens.  finish the follow up 'investigative' journalism.  i'll wait.................................
1847 2018-02-12 20:18:35 Rep. David Perryman, of Chickasha, expresses widespread Demo concern that loophole in tax pkg would protect oil and gas production from ever being taxed at 7 percent.
1848 2018-02-12 20:18:32 This is Canadian oil. It's extracted by a foreign company. But it is still Canadian oil. Millions of Canadians benifit from the oil mined from the Oil Sands in Alberta.
1849 2018-02-12 20:18:10 Buy tea tree oil for about R40 at the blue or green pharmacy. A few drops in your shampoo, or moisturizer or conditioner or even spray bottle and you good to go. A little goes a long way
1850 2018-02-12 20:18:03 Um okay. Today the TBI raided Murfressboro, Nashville vape shops for CBD oil products citing them as synthetic marijuana products. SERIOUSLY TBI?
1851 2018-02-12 20:17:58 This is what I was going to say. A lot of basic physical tasks are alien to many people in the modern world. Like, do you know how to maintain an oil lamp?
1852 2018-02-12 20:17:51 The question should also be how can investors help consumers cure their oil addiction to help meet Paris agreement?
1853 2018-02-12 20:17:38 I really want dumplings w chili oil like REAL BAD
1854 2018-02-12 20:17:37 Agreed. When Israel stops occupying  Syria and taking its oil I will be more inclined to believe their claims that they are facing a new threat after ISIS defeat.
1855 2018-02-12 20:17:32 Sounds lovely ! my infused pancakes are taking a rather different culinary turn ! Just wait for tomorrow
1856 2018-02-12 20:17:30 I've got an original oil painting of Tasslehoff on my wall! Definitely does not look like Scanlan.
1857 2018-02-12 20:17:25 Stop trying to raise GDP!!! Our oil and gas sector has taken all the hits lately. Oklahoma why don’t you tax wind energy so that the whole state gets the money and not just the county!!!
1858 2018-02-12 20:17:04 It's good. Just make sure you don't add water to it at all. Always fry lightly in oil.
1859 2018-02-12 20:17:01 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
1860 2018-02-12 20:17:01 you can still wear mascara with them! you just have to get an oil free makeup remover and be a little bit more gentle when cleaning around your eyes.
1861 2018-02-12 20:16:46 @preservecapecod 
On the issue of off-shore oil and gas drilling, the APCC is resorting to highly questionable speculation, as well as scare tactics which have little grounding in reality or fact. Shame on them!
1862 2018-02-12 20:16:44 Luv to have u on all 4s and I slowly oil it, squeeze and rub it. Making it smooth, shiny and wet 
1863 2018-02-12 20:16:37 I would never pay money to tan . Tanning is so bad for you & pointless like just love your skin color or sit out in the sun with some tanning oil in the summer damn .
1864 2018-02-12 20:16:33 Majority of cities are run by Dems even in red states. Blaming GOP is partisan tripe. Taxes and priorties set funding in these cities

The active contract for crude oil is settling the day up $0.09 or 0.15% at $59.29 per barrel.  The settle price comes in at $59.29.
1870 2018-02-12 20:15:15 A) earth isn’t overpopulated 

B) we have plenary of natural resources not named oil

C) climate change has been accelerated by man

D) Humans are not insects or waste
1871 2018-02-12 20:15:04 We all want and need the oil, right?!  But nobody wants to have it off their coast!  We can’t keep depending on others for it
1872 2018-02-12 20:15:01 @EPAScottPruitt Hope you are enjoying all that lavish travel at our expense. Just another swampy piece of the CHUMP administration. Do your job! Protect the environment and stop selling it off to oil companies & anyone willing to cut you a check.

1875 2018-02-12 20:14:45 Maybe you can put dinos in stations to produce extra resources?
Phiomias on stable= more poop
Dodos on coop= more eggs
weird octopus slime looking things in aquarium= more oil
But they still produce without stations, just less because phiomias would poop anyway
1876 2018-02-12 20:14:28 So right - alwayz burning the midnight, and often daytime, oil.  Luh ya girl.

1889 2018-02-12 20:12:57 I think they do but perhaps they never envisaged that price of crude oil will come down to $30/bbl. That was a major shock. Meanwhile, it is good to note that political promises are things you keep working on until you meet them or you modify if there is  genuine reason for that.
1890 2018-02-12 20:12:51 exactly..also things are different now..there is more oil in storage than ever before..and there is more storage than ever before

1894 2018-02-12 20:12:33 Just cleaned the whole inside of my car, then decided to get my oil changed (bad choice I know) but if these guys mess up the inside of my car I will fist fight all of them.
1895 2018-02-12 20:12:27 Ti posso consigliare una cosa? 
A me capita spesso di avere mal di testa e ultimamente sono riuscita a farmelo passare con il Tea tree oil, mettendone un po' su un dischetto di cotone e passandolo sulle tempie. O in alternativa il vicks, se non hai l'olio.
1896 2018-02-12 20:12:11 So me sticking to my resolution of being more responsible with my priorities went left when I went to get my oil changed and after they were finished I tried to start my car and it wouldn't start. Turning my 20-30$ oil change to 290.47 and they knew they messed my car up
1897 2018-02-12 20:12:01 someone must need a depth 3rd liner
1898 2018-02-12 20:12:01 So, REXXON shrugged off Russian interference, now shirking involvement in the Korean mess-why did 45 hire him, again? Oh, that’s right, he’s not only Putin’s BFF, but can keep a close eye on his oil in the Ukraine.
1899 2018-02-12 20:11:50 Coconut oil works for dry skin. I use it every day
1900 2018-02-12 20:11:43 @CNNPolitics , The media is letting "45" occupy most the news,"stop it" yes cover it but in proportion... I have seen any coverage on Walmart closing stores and laying off thousands of workers. Some of the Oil companies are laying off hundreds of workers... Explain the tax bill
1901 2018-02-12 20:11:36 That is why I said it is because of the leaders we elect who are a reflection of us, the people. It is an African thing - DRC has minerals but people are poor, Nigeria has oil but they export crude, import fuel, rice and human hair. Liberia has the largest Hold deposit but?
1902 2018-02-12 20:11:27 Hey #twitterhjerne - hvem er den mest kompetente i DK ift. europæisk konkurrencepolitik og - og lovgivning? (Og Vestagers bøder er et godt skridt, men tænker på kritik af størrelse generelt a la Standard Oil v. United States)
1903 2018-02-12 20:11:22 So I figure skate. When my knee is purple (bruised) I use aloe Vera. Works so fast. When it feels creaky and stiff I use castor oil(every night)When I have water on the knee (puffy) I use salt on a wet cloth and wrap it with plastic wrap for 45 minutes. I also wear knee pads LOL!

1909 2018-02-12 20:10:26 Think it's something to do with oil
1910 2018-02-12 20:10:23 I know this sounds like hippy woo-woo bullshit, but 1/2tsp of pure black seed oil stirred into a string chamomile tea chills me right the f out.
1911 2018-02-12 20:10:20 Drop of olive oil in your ear and plug it with cotton wool, leave it overnight. Might help!
1912 2018-02-12 20:10:14 Just want to add that mixing used coffee grounds with coconut oil makes a great body exfoliant for before you shave to help you get a close shave! I always exfoliate, soak the hairs with baby oil, shave, go over it with rubbing alcohol to kill bacteria and finish with deodorant!
1913 2018-02-12 20:10:12 @PrueLeith  You got there before all the Instagrammers.... Just made cavolo nero, cashew nuts, black beans, spring onions in sesame oil.

1919 2018-02-12 20:09:39 Hmm add you and a large bottle of baby oil ... now thats perfect 
1920 2018-02-12 20:09:27 Ha! You’ll be boycotting your own product. Alberta and BC beef are locked together. Alberta Benefits BC far more than them us. Next step is to turn off the oil taps and wait for the BC gov to admit defeat.
1921 2018-02-12 20:09:21 3.5 million fans from around the continent recgnized our team as the best of all time. This Oilers fan since inception is going to accept that honour & say thanks. We got 364 other days on the calendar to grouse about the 2018 Oilers, but to grouse about the 1985 Oil is bad form.
1922 2018-02-12 20:09:17 What about oil, still waiting for more of a bounce? Thanks
1923 2018-02-12 20:09:11 a slight and colorful pangea of oil floats in the top of my perfect cup of coffee
1924 2018-02-12 20:09:02 I see our old friend SIS station chief Monty Woodhouse plays another fascinating role in these archives. No interest in oil but concerned about Iran’s exposure to communism... is he pulling an American leg or genuine?
1925 2018-02-12 20:09:01 Here we go! @StepUpOklahoma bills are going to the floor. We're starting with HB1033, the tax hike on tobacco, motor fuels, oil and gas production and wind production.
1926 2018-02-12 20:08:58 I'd question the data for those first couple of years. Previous graph makes it clear its a near 50% fall in actual household use, not just share, and I don't recall anything like that. Later drop in 2012 might be related to putting HST on electricity and not on heating oil.
1927 2018-02-12 20:08:56 I just "mini convection-ovened some carrots with a teaspoon of extra-virgin olive oil".
1928 2018-02-12 20:08:55 I live in a National Forest, on 185,000 acre man made lake. My husband works in the evil oil field industry. My son runs an electrical supply com. I do not pretend to hate all modern advancements.
1929 2018-02-12 20:08:38 Anyone ever come up with an @OilersNow drinking game? I listen almost every day and have a few ideas. When @Bob_Stauffer mentions Manny Viveiros, drink!

1935 2018-02-12 20:07:38 As an oil painter, I can say that if Barak Obama wasn't sitting in all that ivy, his portrait would be very good. It's a great likeness of him. Michelle's, OTOH, is terrible. The skin color is drab and it doesn't look like her.

1949 2018-02-12 20:06:15 You're fighting a losing battle. The marketers/CMOs that hire the snake oil consultants are equally clueless. I saw it for years while on agency side before I washed my hands of it to go in-house. You can't fix stupid.

1957 2018-02-12 20:05:22 What is holding this up? The huge subsidies given to oil and gas and nothing to new applications of electron storage, solar or efficient batteries. Diesel and gas engines continue dominance due to the ignorance of Republicans and their donors!
1958 2018-02-12 20:04:56 Energy independence was supposed to lead to smaller military expenditures, as the US didn't have to secure Mideast oil supplies anymore.  We got the energy independence part, but the military budget is going the wrong way.

1986 2018-02-12 20:01:23 Having the US say "we're killing Muslims and putting Americans at risk of terrorist attacks because we need to control the mideast's oil" would be a huge advance. Then at least Americans could debate it. But of course Mattis wouldn't even say that in private, to the president.
1987 2018-02-12 20:01:12 Materials recovery and wildlife damage are big oil's problems, not wind and solar. There are many locations where sun and wind both exist in abundance. The technology has little to no impact on the environment. 

The liabilities of oil are not Renewables' liabilities, that's BS.

1 tbsp MCT oil
3/4 tbsp cocoa powder
2 tbsp Maglia D'Oro espresso powder
Cream to taste
3 drops monk fruit (or sweeten to taste)

Emulsify then pour over ice.

2050 2018-02-12 19:52:20 Yep. When we know the full story on Iraq I'm sure it will be about oil as well as Bush admin and friends' war profiteering

2071 2018-02-12 19:49:34 Maybe dumb money learned it's lesson to not just blindly buy oil based on non-oil related things. The idiots who pushed oil to 66 from 62 ONLY based on the DXY LOST their money. So I guess others got too scared based on that experience. That makes me happy :)

2080 2018-02-12 19:48:33 In this comparison, would compute not be more analogous to the engine? Commoditisation of data/'sameness' of oil leaves companies to compete on what they can differentiate (the compute/the engine)

2090 2018-02-12 19:47:05 Grapefruit essential oil can assist with boosting mental clarity, self-confidence, overcoming self-doubt, insecurities and negative emotions that keep one bonded to the pain of past experiences. It's up lifting and purifying
2091 2018-02-12 19:47:04 In fact the gaming industry as a whole is being bled/milked dry by corporate entities that no longer care about the product they're selling. Men & women in suits who are no more than snake oil salesman selling lies & cheap thrills in a video game format.

2101 2018-02-12 19:46:18 Much as Cdns dislike the USA I'm surprised they would give US oil exports such a huge boost as blocking this pipeline would give them.
2102 2018-02-12 19:46:11 Oh I see! Sorry haha yes that is fab. I love using natural oils on my hair, especially coconut oil. It works amazing!! #tbhchat

2104 2018-02-12 19:45:35 I'd rather we are burying CO2 when producing oil instead of not, capturing and using or storing CO2 from steel, cement, fermentation etc. instead of not. In those terms, it's imminently sensible, so long as the economics pencils.

2109 2018-02-12 19:45:06 Ah, we're both from an area where oil, propane, and wood stoves are the only way to heat homes. Like, where you store it in a giant tank in your basement or have a woodshed. So I think it won't be that unusual for us. But we've never lived in a house with oil/propane as adults.

2114 2018-02-12 19:44:29 It is a bit counter intuitive. But oil demand is not going to disappear any time soon. Likely the last fuel to go. And industrial direct emissions will persist regardless of fuel inputs.

I totally blame @HeyFranHey for this.

2155 2018-02-12 19:39:40 So if you love your pets, yeah. You can feed them crap.

My toddler loves loves LOVES french fries. So I make my own fries for her from local (re: my garden) potatoes and olive oil. We don't go to McDonald's.

That's not being fancy. That's being a parent.

Don't confuse the two.
2156 2018-02-12 19:39:37 i can't be the only one that i loves the smell of castor oil.
2157 2018-02-12 19:39:22 Also you are forgetting that according to the oil companies themselves the only way they are able to make a profit is government subsidies.
2158 2018-02-12 19:39:08 I scented all those flowers with lavender oil. That way when my kids cause them stress, they just have to sniff and they can relax. You're welcome.  #iknowmykids #beingateacherishard
2159 2018-02-12 19:39:02 Odd they give a negative assessment. Really? The same EU who said they'll be shortly after 2008, the same SNP who published the white paper. The one where they predicted oil revenues at 8bn in 2017 where they were in fact negative

2161 2018-02-12 19:38:34 And the cost of energy in the so called green fields costs more than coal or oil when you look at real COST you spend way more for that than fossils
Not to mention California is full of wind and solar farms NO LONGER IN USE 
If green was so good it would be great there

2163 2018-02-12 19:38:31 Witch hazel is an astringent which helps to tone the skin, remove excess oil, & minimize pores. I believe it rids the skin of dark marks as well? But don’t quote me lol!

2171 2018-02-12 19:37:34 Does that mean selling them out for oil drilling and coal mining Lamar?
2172 2018-02-12 19:37:33 why should anyone sell their stocks because oil is getting cheaper(and reason is not less demand but more supply) same with rates, why should i fear 25bps more? .. yield still no alternative to stocks.
2173 2018-02-12 19:37:20 i’ve found the garnier one works best for me but it leaves behind an oilyish residue even though it says it’s oil free? so i do have to wash my face after. i have the boscia oil and i used it once to try taking my mascara off and it worked but wow unpleasant for my eyeballs
2174 2018-02-12 19:37:08 $70+ per barrel of real price of crude oil did indeed cause concern about global growth, (from -$20/bbl in 1998). 

Greenspan called it inflation; Fed was raising rates.
2175 2018-02-12 19:36:59 I don't think it's a leaked because there's no oil all over the box. It's just half empty bottle when I opened it @PlantTherapy.
2176 2018-02-12 19:36:56 Libya lacks the shia vs Sunni, arab vs Kurd, saudi vs Iran wars. It's also 1/4 population  of Syria and has oil resources to a build modern state. What's incredible is 6 years after the country is a mess, divided, and the hub of the slave trade.

2220 2018-02-12 19:30:48 OIL DIFF: 3.45 -> 3.54
2221 2018-02-12 19:30:37 My fries turned out so well
Worth having a oil bubbles bust and hit my shirtless tummy lol
2222 2018-02-12 19:30:25 And they have a tiny bit Of gas but no oil
2223 2018-02-12 19:30:18 Ain’t like y’all ever got chicken anyway. Shit be gone as soon as y’all throw it on the grill. Ain’t ever got oil after 10 minutes either.
2224 2018-02-12 19:30:13 180243 133009 || ٣٤٥- The oil down the desert way #SSBrandKeyword
2225 2018-02-12 19:30:13 Sell snake oil and other tonics/elixirs for the modern man or lady with health on their mind.
2226 2018-02-12 19:29:41 I have some Sally Hansen cuticle oil that I’ve been using like mad. Seems to help somewhat.
2227 2018-02-12 19:29:06 Not forgetting oil and gas, the revenues from which were not squandered or a great percentage given to oil companies, Norway is bloody rich.
2228 2018-02-12 19:28:54 See Nigerian level of corruption... #TheNigerianSnake who swallowed 36m, we will soon hear mosquitoes sucks away crude oil. Hilarious but highly frustrating, we really need prayers #PrayForNigeria
2229 2018-02-12 19:28:46 Individual agencies write regs/policy without Congress. Not really law but carries same weight. All good when you agree, nt good if you dont
2230 2018-02-12 19:28:37 In the context of european football their all bloody useless not one of those teams could possibly win the European cup oil money or not , they play in a league that says it's the best in the world or at least sky sports says it is
2231 2018-02-12 19:28:32 Indomie oriental cooked with that oil inside indomie onions flavour 
2232 2018-02-12 19:28:32 I thought the oil magnate was gonna be Karamatsu
2233 2018-02-12 19:28:29 Mmhmm. Lightly battered and ready for a bit of oil and then much munching. RAWR!
2234 2018-02-12 19:28:28 Do a 2018 mineral oil build
2235 2018-02-12 19:28:27 AFRICAN BLACK SOAP!!, rosehip oil
2236 2018-02-12 19:28:24 Sure was a lot of time wasted and even more money wasted. Who gives an F about weed...or CBD oil.  None of these are real drugs. Nashville has the worst drug problem of any city I’ve ever lived in. Go after real drugs like meth, heroin...
2237 2018-02-12 19:28:22 Are you asking me, an Okie that cut my political teeth protesting a nuclear power plant that men like Pruitt tried to foist on us? The answer is yes. They have a schizophrenia born out of pretending to be Chreestian, and really being rapacious greed driven oil industry pigs.
2238 2018-02-12 19:28:19 Ooooo the flaaax the maaaaca, the coconut oil 
2239 2018-02-12 19:28:18 Sober voices. The America envoy has smelled oil in Turkana.
2240 2018-02-12 19:28:15 Oil dropping does not help the bulls.. ignored for now
2241 2018-02-12 19:28:15 CBD oil will help. At the end of the day, you can only do so much! And the sympathy votes would come either way - you all are too cute   
2242 2018-02-12 19:28:13 It looks like an oil company logo.
2243 2018-02-12 19:28:08 Ikr  now my house smells like burnt oil
2244 2018-02-12 19:27:57 Sounds like Iraq should be providing some DEEP discounts on our oil, eh?
2245 2018-02-12 19:27:38 I love robotic oil poffins~!
2246 2018-02-12 19:27:33 I’m about to oil tf out my braids 
2247 2018-02-12 19:27:33 My dad told me to come home right after school so I can get my oil change with him and he not even home 
2248 2018-02-12 19:27:32 Use gel shaving cream! It should remove some of the dye. How do I know? We use this when we can’t get red, blue or green pigmented dye off our talents skin after special-effects.  Gel shaving cream, then baby oil. ^ ^
2249 2018-02-12 19:27:23 Corps like NAFTA because it locks in rights for them, which is a reason to walk away from it. Citizens can't benefit most from resources. Norwegians get far more benefits from oil/natural resource production than Canadians do.
2250 2018-02-12 19:26:59 Honestly that's a pretty good description of depression. Again, I can't say what works because I'm still in it, but I can say that please never give up despite how hopeless it seems, because even the tiniest rock can be the safe haven in oil, you just have to find it.
2251 2018-02-12 19:26:49 See, I have to throw that in there so he can get those sympathy votes on being cute . We’ve been battling for almost 3 years. 2 brain surgeries, 2 clinical trials, 20 radiation treatments, and about $30k later. 

I’ve started him on CBD oil now. 

He’s a fighter! A cute one! 
2252 2018-02-12 19:26:48  I went in to get my oil change and they told me I'm like welp better get that fixed I can't be getting pulled over 
2253 2018-02-12 19:26:42 It’s only 11 and I’ve had to drive all the way to shafter then to grapevine back to Bakersfield and I’m not taking a lunch break cause I have no time because I have to work at another job site, 6 story building with no electricity, no elevator and fit time to get an oil change :)
2254 2018-02-12 19:26:31 Relax there's no oil or gas located offshore of RI.
2255 2018-02-12 19:26:29 Don’t let him find out about Norway’s oil. He’d be so jealous.
2256 2018-02-12 19:26:06 While initial EO had no expiration date as I understand It, DHS set 03/05/18 as one. This is the problem with how much of gov works
2257 2018-02-12 19:25:58 China's crude oil imports stands at 70%. It has diversified sources from Iran, Mexico, Angola, Russia etc, mainly countries the USA is at loggerheads with.

2259 2018-02-12 19:25:25 that's bollocks tbh ... if you're turk owners run out of oil / get bored of football ... you'll be back to mid table in a fucking hurry ... with a nice half empty stadium ... enjoy it while it lasts ...
2260 2018-02-12 19:25:21 The sign of a truly great painting is the amount used oil rags to go with it. . Great job!! 
2261 2018-02-12 19:25:11 Oil change then nail date with little sister
2262 2018-02-12 19:24:37 D'essence et de gas oil.
2263 2018-02-12 19:24:34 how are you doing MCT oil in your iced coffee again? I need to switch to iced because of the lower acidity.
2264 2018-02-12 19:24:31 I agree. Suspect we’ll probably have a limited Customs Agreement for a small number of sectors & arrangements to oil the wheels for the rest
2265 2018-02-12 19:24:28 What did PM @narendramodi achieve on his trip to West Asia? Answer is simple.
For first time India will be Oil Storage & Trading hub with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company getting ready to park it's crude at Mangalore. 1st investment from UAE into Indian Oil Project
2266 2018-02-12 19:24:25 Another big jump for EIA's March '18 oil production guess & a big revision up for Feb. Not surprising given STEO. If you want to get their next one (for April), take the Feb oil rig count & multiple by a # higher than current new well oil prod/rig less basin decline. Sheesh #OOTT
2267 2018-02-12 19:24:24 Fracking ensures an effective cap on oil prices - OPEC can no longer dictate terms.
2268 2018-02-12 19:24:15 Wanna get my nails done but I need an oil change and new brakes.. #priorities
2269 2018-02-12 19:24:14 To this day, the US has illegally seized up to 50% of the oil fields in Syria. Does it count?

2272 2018-02-12 19:23:50 Working adults. Another unrealistic thing is how there always manages to be single lesbians EVERYWHERE! Doesn't happen! In my experience, lesbians go into hibernation when they settle down. And lastly, maybe because its Hollywood but every character is a stunning oil painting /3
2273 2018-02-12 19:23:48 In 1941, Standard Oil of New Jersey was the largest petroleum corporation in the world. Its bank was Chase, its owners the Rockefellers. Its chairman, Walter C. Teagle, and its president, William S. Farish, matched Joseph J. Larkin's extensive connections with the Nazi government
2274 2018-02-12 19:23:40 U.S. shale oil output forecast to rise by 110,000 barrels a day in March: EIA

2277 2018-02-12 19:23:18 I will literally pay someone rn to take my car to adventure and get an oil change and tire rotation
2278 2018-02-12 19:23:10 Following Anadarko and Pioneer's announcements last week, which type of shareholder distribution do you expect to emerge as the favourite among US tight oil E&Ps in Q4? @WoodMackenzie @RobertClarke_WM
2279 2018-02-12 19:22:53 Im hungry, I should fry some perogies. 

Just cant take the oil pops and the sticking...
2280 2018-02-12 19:22:40 Honestly, I would recommend anything that has charcoal in it because that’s what gonna help fight all the dirt and oil and minimize pores and blemishes, what’s really helped Rey is a face wipe by the brand yes to tomatos and it has charcoal in it. They sell it at ulta.

2282 2018-02-12 19:22:25 The game is the game and sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Lots of black castor oil, drink water and TLC. Hair grows back.

2284 2018-02-12 19:22:17 The body shop is having buy 2 get one free for tea tree oil... I love capitalism
2285 2018-02-12 19:22:14 If it's from Chick-fil-A I think they use peanut oil to fry their chicken.

2290 2018-02-12 19:21:05 If we need the oil we need to use it. If you can’t support Pres. Trump find another job. #MAGA
2291 2018-02-12 19:20:23 The first line has me cracking up  thank you, doll I wash w/ Eucerine Dermo purifying cleanser, Clinique moisture surge+a drop of sunscreen to moisturize, applying tea-tree oil 2x weekly, home face-mask once a week and finally, drinking water and eating fruits+veggies 
2292 2018-02-12 19:20:15 Oil again ? I thought you did one not that long ago
2293 2018-02-12 19:20:12 RT @LS_Nutrition: Drinks marked as "healthy" or "natural" can be packed with sugar and even oil! This February, read labels carefully.
2294 2018-02-12 19:20:11 Aghhh this kind of tooth ache is horrid... I’ve found that clove oil helps if you have any?

2300 2018-02-12 19:19:22 Is it just me or does the Argan oil Eco Styler flake wayyy more than the Olive oil one....
2301 2018-02-12 19:19:19 You know well that all PE cups go to landfill or else CONTAMINATE recycling bins. Newspapers and cardboard generally aren’t lined with oil.
2302 2018-02-12 19:19:16 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
2303 2018-02-12 19:19:10 I have the same valentine every year. My dad lol Valentine’s Day came early for me this year but he treated me to my fav red lobster got me some Godiva gave me the most beautiful card ever and got my oil changed on top of giving me gas money which will be used for my nails but 
2304 2018-02-12 19:19:04 bread with oil and salt with a side of walnuts is the best thing ever
2305 2018-02-12 19:19:03 It's a good thing - was overvalued, hardly down against the USD, wages are rising, oil price is a bigger factor on inflation than Brexit.
2306 2018-02-12 19:19:02 I'm for the pipeline. Bring the oil coming on America and bring the cost of gasoline prices down!
2307 2018-02-12 19:18:50 Guys, Wojtek trusted me with his credit card to exchange a pair of boots. Should I buy an oil diffuser?
2308 2018-02-12 19:18:41 burt’s bees lip balm is really nice and natural. and sun bum is so good and they have several different levels of spf. I use them both interchangeably after I mix some vitamin e replenishing oil and sugar and scrub it on my lips because no one wants to be crusty :)
2309 2018-02-12 19:18:33 Also dated a jont with a rack of crack head uncles. My cars ain’t never been better serviced than during that relationship. Oil changes were damn near dealer quality and on time, complete tire rotations. That’s hard too on the side of the road.

2311 2018-02-12 19:18:18 Wrong, very much wrong. Printing money, prophylactic expending and expropriation of private assets without compensation are the policies that ruined Venezuela. Populating the national oil company with apparatchiks didn't help either.
2312 2018-02-12 19:18:14 Back at Harmon’s salad bar. Just watched man pour half a bottle of olive oil on his salad.
2313 2018-02-12 19:18:09 The #landgrab makes more than 90% of the outer continental shelf - nearly all of our #federal waters - available for leasing.
If the #TrumpAdministration  gets its way, it could happen quickly. Bidding for #offshore #oil & #gas leases could begin as early as next year.
2314 2018-02-12 19:18:01 ahhhhh...

So - OK if government pushes Pro Gun, or Pro Oil agenda???

Na. We disagree. To me the message doesn't make a difference. No need to push an agenda every chance Libs get a chance.
2315 2018-02-12 19:17:57 There's another factor. You CAN power an entire country on mostly renewable energy.  

But you cannot fight a war without oil to fuel the warfighting machines.

War is very profitable. The whole point of wars is to keep using things that war profiteers sell.
2316 2018-02-12 19:17:44 THE BEST PART OF EATING PASTA IS THE CAREFUL, DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN PASTA, SAUCE AND GRATED CHEESE! TOO MUCH SAUCE, HELL, TOO MUCH OIL IN THE SAUCE RUINS THE WHOLE THING!

2321 2018-02-12 19:17:17 Today was still good because I discovered oil painting for the first time and it's actually very cool
2322 2018-02-12 19:17:10 You certainly know how to join the dots

Up until Pearl Harbor (December 1941), Wall Street was trading with the enemy. In the wake of Pearl Harbor, Standard Oil continued to sell oil to Nazi Germany through the intermediation of so-called “neutral countries”

2335 2018-02-12 19:15:03 okay enjoy that and enjoy not having your arteries clogged with oil! it looks scrumptious tbh
2336 2018-02-12 19:15:00 @StockBoardAsset looks like oil is having a very hard time not going down. I think there will be a lot of legs down in oil this week. before a rally : ]

2344 2018-02-12 19:14:17 Budget passed, cuffs off. Now u will see what a lifelong Democrat turned Republican will do with public works. Finally someone to put $ in our home instead of on missles for oil/opium war 2.0
2345 2018-02-12 19:14:13 Conservatives or gop in the old days used to mean conservation of the environment. This approach is the Russian oil and gas approach. There were some republicans that behaved badly but there were some ethical great republicans that cared for the environment. Not mother Russia.
2346 2018-02-12 19:13:37 It's fried for 20 mins in oil 
2347 2018-02-12 19:13:19 Honestly, I think it should be up to pipeline operators and oil shippers to demonstrate they have financial capacity to clean a major oil spill.  Unlimited liability.  Then we would see if this makes real economic sense.
2348 2018-02-12 19:13:10 Chef Louis cut up some live rats, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with grass.

2358 2018-02-12 19:11:17 There goes my commission. (Kidding.)
Seriously, though, gold/oil is a blunt tool. Only really counts if the spike comes from demand changes.
But as ancillary data, it's interesting to watch.
2359 2018-02-12 19:11:17 It really bugs me when people say naturopaths are all about rose quartz dildos and activated charcoal enemas. We're not that simple. We also like oil pulling.
2360 2018-02-12 19:11:15 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output

2366 2018-02-12 19:09:35 I’m sure that you’ve also given up on all things plastic as well, right? 

Back to the topic at hand, oil and gas giving money to help keep many thousand people employed and their homes heated isn’t as nefarious as you want it to be.

2369 2018-02-12 19:09:28 Cheapest oil change place????
2370 2018-02-12 19:09:27 I recommend baby oil or even lol the natural oil on your skin like your forehead. Avoid exposing the opal ring to chemicals, including jewelry-cleaning fluid. Instead, use water mixed with vinegar or gentle soap. Use a soft toothbrush to lightly scrub or buff the ring and opal.
2371 2018-02-12 19:09:26 Mr. President we have nothing but a bunch of idiot politicians in Oregon so if you wanna bring infastructure to oregon or bring oil production to Oregon please do so
2372 2018-02-12 19:09:25 lots of concentration in banks (housing bubble?) and oil (some of it with a high cost of production)
2373 2018-02-12 19:09:18 This is how they screwed oil
2374 2018-02-12 19:09:17 Oh I bet you are!!! I would be too!!! Coconut oil also helps!!

2378 2018-02-12 19:08:33 Oh, read what she said. She is spot on about our representatives being bought. One Delegate works for the oil company seeking this law to drill without consent. AND Lissa Lucas is running against him.
2379 2018-02-12 19:08:33 Stop calling it "traditional medicine". Call it what it is - snake oil sales.
2380 2018-02-12 19:08:33 I mean, to the best of my understanding. Perhaps they were looking for that elusive "just oil and fruit" restaurant?
2381 2018-02-12 19:08:27  thanks Ash, and I think I can fix them with make up  I’m just going to put castor oil on them! I’m too scared to even try to get them fixed.
2382 2018-02-12 19:08:08 Actually, that was a different Mary. The sinner with the oil was never called Magdalena.
2383 2018-02-12 19:08:02 They have been bribing their way round the world for many years. No despot bad enough if they have oil rights. Removing them won’t change a thing, as trump has removed barriers which were in place.
2384 2018-02-12 19:07:57 Interesting article but new to Finance so don't get it.. but i can see where you are coming from. Used to work in the Oil Industry just before it crashed.
2385 2018-02-12 19:07:53 Bob, just saw Trump says he will have cut into Medicare and social security to pay for his Infrastructure and the WALL! Remember, he said he wouldn’t touch the two programs for our grandparents, and he said Mexico pays for the Wall! Snake oil salesman! We’ve become USA of Stupid
2386 2018-02-12 19:07:33 Man a war tribal, over colors, over money, over land & over oil, over God & over idols & even lovers.
2387 2018-02-12 19:07:32 1)Fuel scarcity has been with us since forever.Options are limited with crude oil price 》$60/bbl.It's either we go to back to subsidy era to marketers or increase PMS price. Both options are poisoned, hence difficult option of 100% import & distribution by NNPC with d failures!

2395 2018-02-12 19:06:39 Russian #Energy Minister Novak: "It could take 3, 4, 5 months or maybe just 2 (to exit the deal). Everyone supports this scenario. Our goal was to take surplus #oil away from the market. At the moment, we see that this goal is achieved by two thirds." #OOTT

2412 2018-02-12 19:04:27 Kellyanne Conway, but no one is exactly sure what she is doing other than showing up in interviews on news programs and annoying everyone with her hair flying in every direction. Get some conditioner or a hot oil treatment, for goodness sake!
2413 2018-02-12 19:04:22 Huh!  Just look at Iraq. Total pillage for Halliburton and big oil.

2428 2018-02-12 19:02:12 Yes the world is changing but your wrong, the oil industry has changed over the years and despite what you think or read the global demand for oil and gas is growing and forecast to grow for decades to come - that is a fact

2439 2018-02-12 19:01:04 Won’t hold my breath. Increasing tanker traffic & oil production taking Liberal precedence. No, saving critically endangered Orcas & increasing tanker traffic will not ever be mutually beneficial.

2455 2018-02-12 18:59:59 Scandinavian countries are doing well, yes.
There are two major reasons for that; 
They depend on the US and Europe because they don’t/can’t finance their own military and because they are not very multicultural.
Their oil is the only thing keeping them from collapsing.

2508 2018-02-12 18:56:24 Friction in a tyre is the connection to the road ??? Friction in the rubber and tarmac, with the force of gravity forms heat. There in an imbalance, thus heat. Friction in the engine is cooled by oil ?? The oil carries the heat, the metals are cooled by the cooled oil.??

2511 2018-02-12 18:56:02 Trump is going to do what he does best - bankrupt America. The IMF will be selling Alaska to Putin in 10 years to pay American debt, Saudi Arabia will be buying oil rights in California all to pay for Don's spending spree. #MAGA

2515 2018-02-12 18:55:36 I didn’t have an excuse as to why I was 3,000 miles over my oil change mark other than dumb blonde “I forgot” so I was offered approx $200 worth of stuff that has to be replaced “right now”

2518 2018-02-12 18:54:55 I remember the first time I saw olive oil in a tiny bottle on a bathroom shelf, not for the kitchen.
2519 2018-02-12 18:54:50 I've just been using some argan oil and I've found it's improved the feel of my hair a ton.  It's so good.
2520 2018-02-12 18:54:48 Hydroelectricity.  But yeah sure, the modern world was built on fossil fuels, which is stupid for obvious reasons. The point is not to stop using oil altogether but to reduce the production while we slowly switch to renewable energies. Tripling the production is dumb af.

2522 2018-02-12 18:54:08 All the pancake mix recipes online say something different! What’s the right flour, egg, milk amounts? What about oil/butter? Thinking @Constant55 might know the answer to this! 
2523 2018-02-12 18:53:42 Sadly. These are a little too mild. I need to add a lot more essential oil in my next batch! But I’m learning 
2524 2018-02-12 18:53:37 you claim NK's aren't allowed to go to other countries freely, & blame NK, but the real blame, again, is sanctions.  NK's are cold? blame sanctions since no one is allowed to export coal or oil to NK.   money transfers? banned, & on and on

2530 2018-02-12 18:52:30 Because you don't like them does not mean they aren't good. If you were truly objective you would comment on media (oil, watercolor), whether paint was given a chance to dry, size, etc. Comments on style, setting, verisimilitude, etc. are  subjective. It's art, after all.
2531 2018-02-12 18:52:25 It’s coming. Be patient. The world knows Russia hacked our election. And this admin doesn’t care. Refuses to indorse bipartisan sanctions and the day they were to go into effect a Russian tanker docked in Boston with oil.
2532 2018-02-12 18:52:18 @HelloFreshUK idea: could you offer the option to purchase decent bottles of olive oil and sea salt as well?
2533 2018-02-12 18:52:13 I think it's cuz the only oil we had was sesame oil and I'm not a huge fan of sesame oil

2538 2018-02-12 18:51:48 No no. It’s not technically life support. It’s a system that allows your oil to be pumped around part of your hoses. They’ve split worse than we thought. That’s why your Oil pressure spiked earlier. I’m working on  to fix it.

2547 2018-02-12 18:50:48 I wasn't in that part of Texas. My main complaint about the Houston area is that it is toxic after years of oil refineries and chemical plants, dumping in some of the waterways, and the high level of sexual predators that got worse each year.

2551 2018-02-12 18:50:31 It makes sense. I always break out with coconut oil but not avocado. What oils would be better to use for carrier oils and things to make creams? Would shea butter be bad as well?

2590 2018-02-12 18:46:32 Its never been done carefully by any country. In South America the Chineese us subaltern soil laws which allows them to abstract oil even from indi. lands.

2606 2018-02-12 18:44:57 no werent but what exactly were/are we there for? oil? seems that isnt quite it either.  hard to pin down why other than big $ for military complex...
2607 2018-02-12 18:44:44 It doesn't. It shifts the burden onto the average Okie while keeping the GPT under the regional average. Tax the oil during production, not when the consumer buys it. Step Up is the industry astro-turfing Oklahomans to protect Big Oil.
2608 2018-02-12 18:44:39 Let's start with a tax on oil and LPG. I'd love to see the effect.

He put a few drops into the water, then just added regular bath soap.
2618 2018-02-12 18:43:12 @essenviews Also disgusting is that: "a bill that would allow oil and gas companies to drill on minority mineral owners’ land without their consent." How is this even possible?? Without consent? Kudos to .@LlysseWylle for standing up to these grifters  - macsloth

2632 2018-02-12 18:40:51 Avoid using cleansing wipes. Why? Cleansing wipes don’t effectively clean the skin. Instead, they just smear dirt, bacteria, oil, and makeup across it. Essentially it is like applying cleanser to your face with soap then not washing it off #skincare

2647 2018-02-12 18:39:17 Customer “can you quote for a new oil boiler, I have a friend who’s a @GasSafeRegister engineer but not @OFTEC registered, he’s going to fit the boiler & said I just need you to certify” me “no thanks” if you’re not qualified GET SOMEONE WHO IS
2648 2018-02-12 18:39:04 I used an eye cream which made my eye dry as anything! Especially when I set it with primer or foundation! I’ve been using the ordinary moroccan oil and my eyelids are almost back to normal!
2649 2018-02-12 18:39:02 تعقدوا البنات 
2650 2018-02-12 18:39:01 Snake oil salesman at work
2651 2018-02-12 18:38:49 Yep! They are almost always better to use as well, you can emulsify oil a lot faster without building up too much heat from the motor below which would then break your emultion faster.
2652 2018-02-12 18:38:46 LMAO. So WTI oil is going to 70 and higher? Laughable. Loon.
2653 2018-02-12 18:38:36 Now he wants raila to recognise the so called legitimacy presidency of uhuru..he is only interested in our shit hole's country oil...this world though
2654 2018-02-12 18:38:19 GOOD climate carbon tax is a SCAM to make some very rich and NOT fix anything
2655 2018-02-12 18:38:16 PLEASE don't sell our public lands to oil and mining companies
2656 2018-02-12 18:38:15 "BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said Monday that he was “very comfortable” with oil prices at their..."
2657 2018-02-12 18:38:02 You have friction in petrol and diesel engines ??? That's why they have oil coolant ??
2658 2018-02-12 18:38:01 guys how do oil city fans cheat in polls i genuinely wanna know
2659 2018-02-12 18:37:49 Fine with me ... we have food n oil.  F them.   City dwelling no respect for country pos....lets do it
2660 2018-02-12 18:37:45 I just had my first part failure on my FIAT. The alternator is mounted so freakin low that in central ny it tends to get splashed. Yea well, it shorted and died. Im thinking about adding to the skid plate under the oil pan to help protect the alternator more.
2661 2018-02-12 18:37:37 I didn't know there was a "i killed my son using snake oil treatment, now you too can have the same experience" crowd. 
Actually, i take that back, they've been with us since the beginning of time. 
Reason #1843 why we are doomed as a species.
2662 2018-02-12 18:37:31 The guy in the parking lot at Mic Mac Mall, weirdly, is the cheapest we have found in the city. $20 or less, take your own oil, I buy mine at Part Source on Strawberry Hill, they have lots of sales.
2663 2018-02-12 18:37:18 There is a great fishing hole for catfish and bass at the base of possum point, we sport fish the Potomac every summer, A ship carries the oil in now, which is also environmentally concerning to me, choosing between 2 evils to side with you. #STOPTHEPIPELINES
2664 2018-02-12 18:37:08 There is port harcourt port, onne. Port is an oil and gas port,dey charge people who import clothes the same as those who bring in oil cargoes that's why it is not used to import other items apart from oil cargoes unlike d Lagos port
2665 2018-02-12 18:37:07 I'm just over here being an oil field bitch and struggling to get an associates 
2666 2018-02-12 18:37:05 Many people are saying Stephen Miller dips his bald head in oil and rubs it all over her body
2667 2018-02-12 18:36:58 Umm, why doesn’t anyone wanna do oil paintings of me? ;( #jealous
2668 2018-02-12 18:36:49 The excuse for the meltdown has been "inflation."  Yet, commodity prices have been coming down (oil, copper, grains, meats) and technological efficiencies have LOWERED costs of doing business.  2018 bonuses are paying down consumer debt.  So, where's the inflation?  No one knows!
2669 2018-02-12 18:36:33 Mine is puttung gas into the oil now too. There is a port at the top of the throttle body that spews gas out with key on, engine off. Some jacked up sensor is making it call for fuel but not the O2 sensor I guess.
2670 2018-02-12 18:36:21 yesterday I finally threw away the nearly empty, kinda moldy, half gallon tub of coconut oil I bought when I left for college and I feel like I lost a best friend
2671 2018-02-12 18:36:12 Lol @indy4England is a joke england would be bankrupt without the rest of the UK and especially without scottish oil #indy4England
2672 2018-02-12 18:36:08 Me: I can change my oil by myself I don’t need a man to do it.
Also me: Dad, help the oil cap is on too tight.
2673 2018-02-12 18:35:45 I love rosehip oil. I use it on my face every morning and my face is moisturized all day. It adds a glow to my face. I love it 
2674 2018-02-12 18:35:39 I’d be wanting them cooked in truffle oil by Jamie Oliver with Ryan Renolds feeding me them for that price
2675 2018-02-12 18:35:38 No one would ever attack Canada. You know why? It’s right next to the United States Of America. Otherwise, Russia and China would be having a war for oil. Canadian oil.
2676 2018-02-12 18:35:29 Someone dip me in oil my skin dry as hell
2677 2018-02-12 18:35:22 We water our trees, they produce olives, we pick them, get them pressed and have delicious oil. So they go through a process but are not 'processed' - correct? (only you mention oil in your 2/2 tweet).
2678 2018-02-12 18:35:12 Just like people have their own blood group your vehicle also has its own oil type. Using the correct oil can significantly improve performance and the life of your car 
2679 2018-02-12 18:35:11 They have no oil anways
2680 2018-02-12 18:35:10 Finna smoke, clean out my car, get my oil changed, and take my ass back to sleep
2681 2018-02-12 18:35:00 Now THIS is hilarious. 
Getting Oil change in Carries car and the guy opens the hood and a BIRD  flies out!! There is a whole nest in the corner under the hood.
2682 2018-02-12 18:34:57 @donald_gatton Hey there! Can you build copper essential oil distillers?
2683 2018-02-12 18:34:17 Didn't want to make this sound as hate!! /: I love that you don't limit yourself and that you know how to have a healthy diet. Sorry if it came across rude. *dont forget about Palm oil *
2684 2018-02-12 18:34:17 Just one more week of oil field bullshit and I get to play my drums after a whole year!! Back to blasting
2685 2018-02-12 18:34:13 Question what was the Oil and Gas compromise @okea —they privately agreed to 4% months ago—this is what they want—we will need a higher gross production tax to truly dig out of this deficit.
2686 2018-02-12 18:34:06 decided to get some practice with oil paints so i’m painting a sunset lol
2687 2018-02-12 18:34:05 I GOT MY OIL PEN
2688 2018-02-12 18:34:03 I heard tea tree oil works the best when I had one I used coconut oil
2689 2018-02-12 18:34:01 Rose oil as a facial moisturizer too >>>>>
2690 2018-02-12 18:34:00 Oh ok sure! I've been using the cbd oil for a little bit now from holland and barett, but I gotta try these gummies. Cbx definitely helps with anxiety for me
2691 2018-02-12 18:33:51 Oil & Has company - You gotta be careful what you sign up for these days...

2693 2018-02-12 18:33:36 My PB separates into PB & oil if I don't refrigerate it.  Its only ingredients are peanuts and salt, and it recommends refrigeration after stirring on the label.
2694 2018-02-12 18:33:36 I'm about to do it right now when I get my sandwich. 

"I'd like turkey, provolone cheese, mayo (on both sides of the bread), lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle,  salt, pepper, a splash of oil and vinegar and that's a lot. 

Thank you."
2695 2018-02-12 18:33:23 Engine oil makes your hair look really good one day and non-existent the next
2696 2018-02-12 18:33:12 Janab danishwar sb. Tehreek? Kahan hain wo chaacha darzi? Ching chi wala? Sab drama tha. Tehreek chali hi thi k wohi punctured tyres replaced with originals and used mobil oil injected in the engine. To kesay chalti? LOL
2697 2018-02-12 18:33:10 Madam Aisha I expect more from u. U shld not just talk for talk sake. So it's buhari who leaders the Independent oil marketers? Have u ever tried to find out what exactly is going on in d oil sector? Why don't u do that first and be in a position to ask and critisize buhari
2698 2018-02-12 18:33:01 Safe trip and we will see you soon. WC
2699 2018-02-12 18:32:57 Got an oil change for the first time in 18 months. My car needed the fuck out of this lol.
2700 2018-02-12 18:32:46 That's why the American people like him because he say things like that 7trillion USD damn keep that money home unless we made triple that in oil
2701 2018-02-12 18:32:25 And I did nothing special to that sauce. It was literally just some olive oil, red wine, and 2 cans of tomatoes I pureed in my blender. Slow cooked with all that meat in there. The flavor comes from the meatballs and braciole.
2702 2018-02-12 18:32:18 Somebody is about to jump up and yell that that's racist.

I won't care.
2703 2018-02-12 18:32:12 To every journalist, at the expense of “all other” stories: no, of course not. GG? Yes, I do think he should uncover oil/real estate ties
2704 2018-02-12 18:32:06 Thing is, that's all we are to you, a prize to be won. Beyond our votes, our oil and a desire that we remain subservient, we mean nothing to you at all. It's England who keep voting tory, take your campaign where it matters.
2705 2018-02-12 18:32:06 Barry has sold out to Harold Hamm and big oil. I’m with the dems
2706 2018-02-12 18:31:53 Chubby girl Miranda Kelly massage with oil and toys...
2707 2018-02-12 18:31:41 First accident of the day this morning, rumor we are hearing is that one driver was distracted by a man standing on the corner just after using @LikeGrandpa all natural Beard Oil. #BroGiggz
2708 2018-02-12 18:31:36 I'll never understand why Jersey Mikes puts oil and vinegar on a turkey club. Ruins the sandwich
2709 2018-02-12 18:31:14 No, I wouldn’t. Social Security is a benefit. It’s one that I bought and paid for with my own money.
2710 2018-02-12 18:31:11 You've already blamed the media without having any way of knowing. 

Oil that chainsaw.
2711 2018-02-12 18:31:06 Althoughhhh... This kid I just started seeing has a manual Civic he's willing to teach me to drive stick with! And I think I'mma cox him into teaching me to change my own oil... Thats a hella start.
2712 2018-02-12 18:31:04 Do not mistake this dispute over oil and land and water to be a trade war, @JustinTrudeau. No, this is 500 years of settler history coming to rest on your shoulders. You have some crucial decisions to make about how this world, and Canada, reconciles itself with its dark past.
2713 2018-02-12 18:30:57 What????
Venuzuelans fleein Obama/Chavez & Hollywood Liberals’ ideal of Socialist/Liberal wonderland  - an oil-rich country,, once thriving , brought to its knees by Liberal  & Democrat Policies,  like Detroit,  California , etc. The govt took over oil & most other business! Dead
2714 2018-02-12 18:30:53 We get it already you man shaped bag of plagues, war is good for oil demand which is what the Koch Brothers want!
2715 2018-02-12 18:30:52 OIL DIFF: 3.51 -> 3.51
2716 2018-02-12 18:30:48 I miss them both & because of him & Solar energy the Republicans are on the wrong side of history.  The end of oil & it’s pollution will be severely halted!
2717 2018-02-12 18:30:38 On the donor conference for #Iraq rebuilding #USA didn't pledge it's money for it! So after bombing it, demolishing it, killing it, stealing it's oil and wealth, they don't want to help Iraqi people with their money! This is not what "the leader of the world" is supposed to do!
2718 2018-02-12 18:30:27 My friend's sister has gone off the deep end on this, with zero knowledge of how it actually works.  She's guzzling snake oil like it was water.
2719 2018-02-12 18:30:26 I didn’t know I’d have to pick my brother up today so obviously there’s conditioner and oil running down my neck
2720 2018-02-12 18:30:24 a oil change from my boyfriend
2721 2018-02-12 18:30:18 Copaiba oil affects our endocannabinoid receptors more than cannabis, either or is great though.
2722 2018-02-12 18:30:13 I know I'm weird, but the smell of pot simmering in coconut oil or butter (butter today, out of co) is sooooo good to me. 

Yes, I'm making edibles later. Maybe I'll share.
2723 2018-02-12 18:30:07 @SearsAuto @MatAnaya @trevo42 how long would you expect an oil change to take, assuming you made an appointment in advance? #PatientlyWaiting
2724 2018-02-12 18:30:04 OIL DIFF: 3.5 -> 3.56
2725 2018-02-12 18:29:43 When are y'all going to sanction Russia for the crap they did and do? They've hacked our election systems at state levels and DNC, has helped NK evade some sanctions on oil and no telling what else. You're even letting them put our own people at risk in Syria.
2726 2018-02-12 18:29:12 As long as he passes a drug screen I don't care if he injects gypsy tears, shorts fairy dust, rubs whale oil on it. Just get on the field!
2727 2018-02-12 18:29:11 FACT: During renovation, construction workers are tethered to the discovery of electricity in the 19th century, nervous systems used oil.
2728 2018-02-12 18:28:45 "if you don't wear makeup why would you wash your face" my dude....do you never ever go outside, sweat, produce oil or touch your face with your grimy hands
2729 2018-02-12 18:28:45 You earn Medicare by turning 65.
2730 2018-02-12 18:28:36 If you say *oil well* while sighing we'd probably get along ....
2731 2018-02-12 18:28:36 Will end my day with ginger lavander oil. 
2732 2018-02-12 18:28:34 Shit, not even if I use oil paints?
2733 2018-02-12 18:28:29 getting an oil change at the dealership is so much more fun when it’s your moms car & your 12 or younger & your brother is with you
2734 2018-02-12 18:28:24 Your car take full or semi synthetic oil
2735 2018-02-12 18:28:12 #oxfamscandal Its Circle the rich run the world pay collapse of Country they had interest natural resources I.e Oil then through Aid and international community peace keepers are used to exploit resources escaping tax then sex trafficking and child soldiers be second business.
2736 2018-02-12 18:28:10 Of all journalists, I’d hope GG (better?) would investigate this nexus of oil and real estate. One might assume its in his wheelhouse
2737 2018-02-12 18:27:48 I discovered through sheer chance the fact that fish oil on the blisters helps, and if you need for the blisters to be covered, band aids will stick while covered in fish oil.
2738 2018-02-12 18:27:34 It's awful. We don't have access to the oil money or the the Russian mafia's money either and we have won more trophies than Liverpool and tottenham in the last past five years.
2739 2018-02-12 18:27:28 I love driving a car with sub-$3 oil filters. Even the Motorcraft original is ~$4.

I assume your oil price is for synthetic?
2740 2018-02-12 18:27:26 Oil pollutes environment when not exploited properly and data pollutes dashboards when not gathered and analyzed properly
2741 2018-02-12 18:27:24 Chapter 2 of Picnics In The Face Of Danger Feat. @UncleChaps is cooking w peanut oil!!!!
2742 2018-02-12 18:27:22 Many Happy returns of the day. God bless you with more oil and more anointing and more of grace as you age.
2743 2018-02-12 18:27:22 @lovephilosophy purity made simple cleanser and sweet almond oil on face, neck and decollete as moisturizer.

2746 2018-02-12 18:27:01 Thank you for taking this Twitter advocacy to the media! Grassroots work shone a light on both a crooked dishonest snake oil salesman (Thiessen and his changing tune) and a man profiting from the very woo that resulted in his son's death - lesson for sponsors
2747 2018-02-12 18:26:51 Today I did laundry, cleaned out my wardrobe & made my own chilli oil.
2748 2018-02-12 18:26:46 How much for a oil change
2749 2018-02-12 18:26:42 Celebratory oil changes? We approve!
2750 2018-02-12 18:26:30 Before we push for 100% enforcement of NCL, it's ideal for fine out if our capital/money market operations can locally handle upto 25℅ funding and investment demands of the oil and gas industry?
2751 2018-02-12 18:26:26 I was wondering how many of my friends use CBD hemp oil and the benefits they’ve experienced from it.
2752 2018-02-12 18:26:19 yeah ok oil spill
2753 2018-02-12 18:26:19 Can u guys stop these nonsense & wastage of money time. So interested in getting pictures in press try something else instead of such childish stuff. Did u guys pressurised the iit iim & scientist to solve oil alternative?
2754 2018-02-12 18:26:11 Best team?
Right after SAF retired, the same team struggled to 7th
The kind of oil money that has been brought in last decade, Rooney is a rare English breed that survived and performed

Look at the Prem now, more difficult than ever
Shearer wouldn't have scored those many now
2755 2018-02-12 18:26:03 ONLY IN CANADA - we are forced to send oil to America at a large discount because BC wont allow us to get to tidewater to sell for better prices meanwhile Eastern Canada buys oil at full price from crooked governments like Nigeria, Venezuela, Saudi....ONLY IN CANADA !!!!
2756 2018-02-12 18:25:37 You mean just like we can pump sand into the Louisiana marshes like they do in Dubai?

In order to save our coastline, the oil companies screwed up by dredging canals?

Seems like the business model is in cleanup, not prevention.
2757 2018-02-12 18:25:32 Don't call it what it is? 
Optional transfer payments ?
2758 2018-02-12 18:25:28 Lol. Vape oil or whatever it's called. The liquid you need to vape.
2759 2018-02-12 18:25:17 @BobGodec I still don't understand why this Ninja is meddling in kenyan affairs.
Oil ni ya watu wa Turkana.
2760 2018-02-12 18:25:09 (they're a little dry because of the lack of oil but still crispy/crunchy on the outside so i guess it works!)
2761 2018-02-12 18:25:01 Yes! Oil balancing as well. I’m defo going to email
2762 2018-02-12 18:24:56 I was there that day! C plate 9000 that only did 2 runs before leaving a Exxon style slick when cooler went pop, drove it home with very regular oil top ups, just don’t make em like that anymore.
2763 2018-02-12 18:24:55 Getting my oil changed and dude in the pit just told me that the old filter wasn't on tight. This explains the random oil drip on my driveway.
2764 2018-02-12 18:24:25 Oil changed
Tires checked 
Ready for Laredo tomorrow by myself
2765 2018-02-12 18:24:06 You were obviously not raised Catholic. 

“Unction” is anointing with oil (at Last Rites it’s “extreme unction.”)

So “unctuousness” would be akin to oiliness, slipperiness or (by implication) sycophancy or ingratiation. Not something I want in either beef or a Senator!
2766 2018-02-12 18:24:01 Rep. @jdunnington, I know it's a tough decision, but I encourage you to change your planned vote. Your constituents will remember how you voted on a plan largely backed by greedy oil and gas. Please vote 'NO.'
2767 2018-02-12 18:23:52 Probably bc your behind keep trying to put these relaxers in your hair so you won’t be natural lol but I can only tell you what I use, everybody hair is different .. I use an olive oil leave in conditioner, design Essentials moisture treatment oil, then their daily moisturizer !
2768 2018-02-12 18:23:42 I gotta get up early on my day off on Wednesday to get my oil changed. 
2769 2018-02-12 18:23:26 we bought a Tefal cooker which means I can finally have chips that are guaranteed gluten and sunflower oil free! 
2770 2018-02-12 18:23:23 All I know is the fishery has recovered.  Catches are back to predisaster levels and tests show fish are safe to eat.  Natural bacteria that eats oil serves as a natural filter and over time has removed most of the oil spill.
2771 2018-02-12 18:23:15 Trump's new budget won't land us on the moon anytime soon: WHY ??? TOO MUCH "MIDDLE EAST OIL" THIEVERY COSTIN' TOO PHUK'N MUCH ??
2772 2018-02-12 18:23:10 Pan fry 15 minutes on medium heat. Be sure to add olive oil to really bring out the flavor. Garnish with lemon.

2774 2018-02-12 18:22:56 Cooking eggs with a wee bit of vegetable oil is so GOOD
2775 2018-02-12 18:22:48 Silver anywhere sub 16.60 is better deal than when it was 13s,near end of 2015. Oil(biggest mining cost)is twice as expensive now $SLV $GLD
2776 2018-02-12 18:22:41 Forgot to use my beard oil today 
2777 2018-02-12 18:22:39 Hi Daniel - we have received word that crew members are currently investigating a possible mechanical issue onboard that may involve an internal oil leak. More info to come. ^nb
2778 2018-02-12 18:22:34 Seriously feel so much better about myself now that I know what this thing is I thought I was just old  although I swear by vitamin E oil it works wonders!
2779 2018-02-12 18:22:24 Reluctant to get rid of rubbish this week as most half term school holiday homework consists of making the International Space Station, the Taj Mahal or a fully operational oil rig out of recyclable materials.

A heads up maybe sir?

2786 2018-02-12 18:21:04 hey! I know of herbal supplements, you can try white willow bark capsules (usually about 500-700mg) or tea, magnesium liquid on your feet or capsules, take as much as needed or try lavender oil massage it (lease effective imo).
2787 2018-02-12 18:21:04 Next? You ran out of oil
2788 2018-02-12 18:21:00 Not even remotely pleased with @garnierUSA Olia. Not only did the "oil blend" leave my hair incredibly dry & damaged feeling, but the teardrop bottle was nearly impossible to grip for small hands, & difficult to squeeze.
2789 2018-02-12 18:20:58 @sheetz your employees at the Fayetteville WV location are lacking to say the least. If I buy 2 salads with extra olive oil and vinegar, and add grapes to both, I should get more than 3 cups of dressing and one damn bag of grapes considering the upcharge amount. #unsatisfied

2798 2018-02-12 18:19:44 @22fanRMFC  One thing I’ve learned was LOC, and that’s basically the rule for how to treat my hair: liquid, oil, and then cream. It’s the idea that you wet your hair first, then you add oil so that it can trap the moisture in, then you put a moisturizer or a cream over it.
2799 2018-02-12 18:19:21 Should be interesting to see all the “Trump is a fascist, words are actual violence,” lunatics applaud this.
2800 2018-02-12 18:19:18 5% difference between D's and R's in SC, currently FL has more registered D's (they just hated Hillary) and Louisiana would be richer than the federal govt. if they got to keep their oil revenues like other states do.    Criteria for that poll is whack, # of Federal Employees?
2801 2018-02-12 18:19:17 @POTUS cuts taxes, raises expenditures to new levels. No wonder he went bankrupt! Now, he is driving the ship of state towards that proverbial iceberg. Gas prices continue to rise as companies export more oil instead of #AmericaFirst. #winning ? I think not

Why do we put up with this nonsense.
2812 2018-02-12 18:18:02 @AbbyMartin After 9/11 US could have invaded any country in Middle East. What country did it invade? The one where sharia law was banned. Yes banned! Didn’t think to invade wahabbi Saudi where 15/19 hijackers came from. I guess that would have affected oil prices. Hmm....
2813 2018-02-12 18:17:57 Narrow economy, in recession, struggling pension funds, massive job losses, lavish oil tax credits ($800 million), pink slips, crumbling roads, crumbling parks and rec, ignorant lawmakers.

2922 2018-02-12 18:07:05 Picture made possible by the the Oil and Gas sector of Canada skis/polls/ski boots/hats/ski pants/jackets (&the phone that took the pic)—all made from oil and gas products and bi-products.                                     Irony is thicker than a tablespoon of bitumen.

2926 2018-02-12 18:06:40 apparently bio oil is a scam and I've been using it for years. can someone recommend me a good inexpensive face oil for hydration
2927 2018-02-12 18:06:38 Where did you get that misinformation??? Pharmaceuticals & Wall Street have some of the biggest lobbyists & money contributors to campaigns (long with Telecommunication & Oil).
2928 2018-02-12 18:06:26 I use a combination of peppermint and coconut oil applied directly on the scalp. Also only using a co-wash as opposed to a regular shampoo helps to decrease stripping the hair down to the scalp causing dryness and cracking.
2929 2018-02-12 18:06:17 Things I googled today: The hormones, muscles etc involved in kissing. The number of buttons on men's shirts. Greek olive oil.
2930 2018-02-12 18:06:17 But why Do these numbers only come in context to benefit the Oil distributers. In late 2016 and the biggest part of 2017 the international prices for oil per single barrel dropped to more than half it didn't seem to move an inch in Uganda how is that
2931 2018-02-12 18:06:12 It’s 35 degrees outside but I need to do my oil change 
2932 2018-02-12 18:06:04 Ndivo ma popeye acho. Same thing when krispy kreme opened in tokyo and rosebank. Queues for weeks on end. Isu we know to queue for fuel and money and sugar and bread and oil and hupfu. That's plenty.

2942 2018-02-12 18:05:14 Methane emissions reduction from oil and gas in North America examined: Levels continue to rise despite pledges - and of course there is Trump's resistance to moving in the right direction on #climate change response.

2946 2018-02-12 18:04:47 So its like a machine? Don't machines need oil to lube things up? Too much friction in a machine is a bad thing yeah?
2947 2018-02-12 18:04:38 Throw in PPH for the trifecta.
2948 2018-02-12 18:04:38 You keep saying this, but millions more have received nothing.
Your Tax Plan gave oil companies like Exxon a 6 billion dollar windfall, so how come gas prices aren't dropping?
2949 2018-02-12 18:04:27 Jobs are being lost left and right, oil prices are tanking, bond market is collapsing, stock market is volatile. Oh yeah and Medicare/caid, ssdi is getting pummeled by fed govt. That won't hurt us one bit.
2950 2018-02-12 18:04:25 lol no 
That’s why the almost was there. 
Too much oil and not enough sugar
2951 2018-02-12 18:04:06 These portraits are super great but also I gotta jump on the wet blanket grind and sum up the other side of Obama: Worst prez in history re whistleblowers, expanded oil and gas exploration more than Bush, solidified unaccountable exec branch, harshest modern immigration prez

2970 2018-02-12 18:01:46 The current value of data and therefore data firms as compared to say. 7 years ago. The worlds economy and the cultivation of it is no longer driven by raw material like oil, but digital material like rooted in data collection, analysis and application.
2971 2018-02-12 18:01:35 Between 2010-2015, there were more than 3300 incidents of crude oil and liquefied natural gas leaks or ruptures on U.S. pipelines.
2972 2018-02-12 18:01:31 Man would have not thought the public radio overlords would be beardshy. Second reason makes sense tho! Still I’d say give beard oil a shot, buy a small bottle you might like it.

2982 2018-02-12 18:00:17 Definitely playoffs for sure. I think contender status will have to wait until Benson, bear, yamamoto, maksimov, and/or safin crack the lineup and finally give the oil depth.
2983 2018-02-12 17:59:57 Is the issue that you feel that oil and gas is being picked on over other industries?  It is a major contributor but all sectors and citizens need to take a hit and change big time.  This is a major FU
2984 2018-02-12 17:59:56 gotta change my oil and stuff soon 
2985 2018-02-12 17:59:32 im sorry you dont have a shimmer body oil
2986 2018-02-12 17:59:30 Yes that's right, it only uses 1 teaspoon of garlic oil 
2987 2018-02-12 17:59:23 I wear a mixture of Water Goddess, an oil by Kuumba Made, and Chance by Chanel, and that's basically who I am in a nutshell.
2988 2018-02-12 17:59:22 Oh, I ordered in a shop rose essential oil once. For the first, I had to wait like a month fir delivery, for the second, it was twice as expensive as online. It was last time I ordered something in a shop... Like a tear ago. 
2989 2018-02-12 17:59:21 Woodmans takes forever, all I want is an oil change ... what’s going on in there
2990 2018-02-12 17:59:15 When you just go to get your oil changed and they find a bunch of other things wrong with your car.. can I ever just come for an inspection and NOT have something wrong with it? There goes my tax return..

And idk how I feel about this.
2995 2018-02-12 17:58:48 Appears so. Tribe was wrong. But Greenwald is allergic to investigating Russian connections to Trump. Which is a shame cause it implicates ruling classes of oil and real estate. Neolib is bad, emerging feudalism worse

2997 2018-02-12 17:58:24 Well, take Russia and the US out of any rationale discussion.  The Saudis are also building nuclear plants at this very moment - my nephew is there - and have tons of solar.  I would need to see the data for Norway. Of course oil will be used in 20 years - but for fewer things.

3008 2018-02-12 17:57:28 The little I know about paintings is I don't think this is an oil at all. I suggest it is acrylic, which gives it that dull look. Not a good likeness, at any rate.
3009 2018-02-12 17:57:27 Luka lacks athleticism to match up and play defense so to have him and Zach on the same team ouch! Bagley is a PF not C and doesn't play defense well either. Ayton needs to change the oil in his motor, he only plays when he wants. Defense is the theme here. Lol.
3010 2018-02-12 17:57:23 All these people my age are leaving the country and taking vacations and I can’t even afford my oil change 
3011 2018-02-12 17:57:19 Smells like oil pollution
3012 2018-02-12 17:57:18 @dianemwu That was one hell of a story you just produced. Right down to the baby oil.
3013 2018-02-12 17:57:15 The coconut oil slows the caffeine release, and it helps w memory its good fat for the brain 
3014 2018-02-12 17:57:08 I don't even understand how I burned my cheek with tea tree oil 
3015 2018-02-12 17:56:59 And if anyone thinks that our engagement in the Middle East had anything to do with charity instead of protecting our access to oil, they need to read more. We support dictators and democracies as long as they're willing to feed our 'hunger'.
3016 2018-02-12 17:56:46 It's actually at 3610 currently down from 3680 last year. Has been relatively stable (shockingly) since it hit 3600 about 18 months ago...
I'd have to confirm crude oil prices globally. Been a minute since I checked up on those
3017 2018-02-12 17:56:33 Hey mom! What’s the best brand of coconut oil to use for pulling?
3018 2018-02-12 17:56:23 and the shocking words oil markets ....
3019 2018-02-12 17:56:09 Followed.
3020 2018-02-12 17:55:56 Pretty sure he consistently doesn't vote like one. Tax renewables, lower tax on oil, shift burden to least among us. Not what I stand for.
3021 2018-02-12 17:55:43 what stuns me is the Turkish comments here- despite supprting training isis and oil trading with them fijijcing them millions everyday. .. yet it's always Usa and Israel to blame for..
3022 2018-02-12 17:55:32 Aside from how hypocritical he sounds regarding climate change and aside from how ridiculous it is to call the US backward when speaking in the Middle East... He's telling a region, which provides 40% of earth's oil, that fossil fuels are BAD. Know your audience, ffs.
3023 2018-02-12 17:55:27 Dow surging over 400 points higher- volatile session again but will it hold gains over the next 3 hours or pare them? Mkts seem to have very short memories. Riding bond yields being ignored, FX mkts barely changed against USD. Oil hovering just under $60. @TheBubbleBubble
3024 2018-02-12 17:55:25 Yeah. Or, send a pic. Also when you reseason, use only oil, don't add any aromatics or whatever, those aren't as important and can result in that happening, probably.
3025 2018-02-12 17:55:10 With oil changes taking no longer than 30min, we can have you up and going in no time and with our great prices you won’t have to empty your wallet. #gillexpress #truckrepair #truckwash

3028 2018-02-12 17:54:50 ...and my friend, this is not your oil, only your oil tax revenues. It's foreign owned and destined to foreign shores.
3029 2018-02-12 17:54:44 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong.

3031 2018-02-12 17:54:16 There are also the ones that made themselves a law to the right to steal Oil and gas from people with the mineral rights That wouldn’t let them drillStealing their minerals and not giving them a penny and they’re criminals and need to go to jail
3032 2018-02-12 17:54:15 They using Synthetic or "Full Synthetic"? There is a slight difference. 

Sadly, that's become more common that most folks don't work on their own cars anymore let alone change their own oil. My son's won't be like that if I can help it. Call me old fashioned.
3033 2018-02-12 17:54:03 i keep trying to fight but its an uphill battle and I think I'm standing in an oil slick
3034 2018-02-12 17:53:57 I would recommend the La Roche-Posay Toleraine Double Repair Moisturizer UV; it doesn't leave a white cast and absorbs quickly. If you're looking for something a little cheaper, the Cetaphil Oil Control Moisturizer with sunscreen is great too!
3035 2018-02-12 17:53:52 There are new innovations coming out in the oil industry all the time to make it safer to extract and move safely to market. Freight train/rail technology has pretty much capped.
3036 2018-02-12 17:53:48 Sesh omnyama ogeza nge oil agcobise nge polish 
3037 2018-02-12 17:53:38 Finn has a really unhealthy obsession with eating coconut oil, but at least it has its benefits
3038 2018-02-12 17:53:30 One of my malleable favs is farro (alt: any hefty grain), feta (on preference), crushed walnuts (alt: any nut), dried cranberries (again, any dried fruit, chopped apricot is nice!). Tiny dash of salt, splash of olive oil, lemon juice.
3039 2018-02-12 17:53:09 so apparently, virgin coconut oil is bad for ur skin. I'll just consume it then.
3040 2018-02-12 17:53:08 KSA crucifies prisoners, cuts off their hands. US waterboards prisoners and puts them in solitary for a life-time. Still, this doesn't stop #oil and #arms being traded. #Trump sword-danced recently. no one paid any mind.
3041 2018-02-12 17:53:02 Roasted beets, parsnips, & carrots. Cut the veggies into pieces, toss with butter or olive oil (optionally plus salt/pepper/rosemary for seasoning), and roast in 350F oven until tender. The beets turn the parsnips pink (for Valentine's Day!) & the carrots day-glow orange!
3042 2018-02-12 17:53:01 Karnes County Sheriff says no injuries or damage in latest of string of small earthquakes in area, thinks chance connected to fracking by oil/gas companies #KSATnews
3043 2018-02-12 17:52:57 How long does it take to change oil ? I’ve been here for almost two hours 
3044 2018-02-12 17:52:54 The paintings of #TheObamas are basically just thirst traps done in oil paint. It's unreasonable for any TWO people on earth to be that stunning.
3045 2018-02-12 17:52:47 The Iraqi Transparency Alliance for Extractive Industries argued that project-level,
company-specific disclosures would be necessary for them to reconcile production
volumes data provided by the Ministry of Oil with funds received from the Ministry of
Finance, to ensure citizens
3046 2018-02-12 17:52:47 The Golan heights where Genie Energie has oil rights.  The board of directors of Genies is the who's who of the Deep State.  The puzzle always comes together when one does his/her research

3055 2018-02-12 17:51:22 It's both irrefutable and incontrovertible that recent history has documented Erdogan as a 'bad actor'.  He has supported jihadists providing weapons, provisions, treatment for the wounded and purchased millions of gallons of ISIS oil for his son Bilal' s 38+ oil tankers.

Equities stage a mild comeback, the move led by the tech, financial, and energy sectors; oil lends a hand with a 2% rally; US 10y Treasuries remain in focus with yields fleetingly touching above 2.90%; NZD broadly unchanged - steadying the ship.

3075 2018-02-12 17:48:33 The economy was in tatters from the Bush admin and he helped recover it. Kudos on voting for the candidate over party though. I guess time will tell how DT policies will work out. IMO, we’ll see a case of déjà vu, a spike in oil prices, and decline in house prices.
3076 2018-02-12 17:48:15 Will S Africa turn into a large desert, if the water shortage gets any worse major catastrophe in the future. Could water be exported on a similar basis to oil, or can S Africa build the infrastructure to process sea water?

3080 2018-02-12 17:47:41 Dames never get oil changes for they whips
3081 2018-02-12 17:47:20 I guess Michelle Obama didn’t like her own face, so she had an oil base face lift. Unfortunately it doesn’t look anything like her, or should I say, fortunately it doesn’t look anything like her. In fact it looks more like Melania Trump. Can’t make this stuff up. Still laughing!
3082 2018-02-12 17:47:14 The days of "railroad expansion" are pretty bygone save a few proposed high speed options, utilities have given mostly to underground temporary easements. The mining and oil damage is bad. I feel if the tribes want to mine let them, but stop ignoring them.

3099 2018-02-12 17:44:25 No-Bean (Zucchini) Hummus
From Rawvolution, by Matt Amsden
2 zucchini peeled and chopped
¾ cup tahini
½ cup fresh lemon juice
¼ cup olive oil
4 cloves of garlic
2 ½ tsp seasalt (I find 2 to be enough)
1 ½ tsp of ground cumin
 Blend all in a high speed blender
3100 2018-02-12 17:44:08 PCV is molded into the valve cover. it's the little circle with the vent on the opposite side of the oil cap.
3101 2018-02-12 17:44:07 ABSOLUTELY TRUE! Your a great PRESIDENT and I am proud to say I voted for you.
3102 2018-02-12 17:43:58 Please raise the gas tax. It’s hasn’t been raised in 25 years. Put it in a lock box so it can’t be rapped by Congress for projects outside of transportation. It’s a lot easier to raise the tax when oil prices are low. This is how our original transportation systems were built.
3103 2018-02-12 17:43:55 I'd also offer that investments need to have a significant focus on mass transit - which has the potential to address multiple other issues such as greater access to shopping and jobs, possible reduction of impervious surface, and much less reliance on non-US oil.

3110 2018-02-12 17:42:53 No. Not everything is about oil. It’s about controlling the world economy and keeping the dollar as the standard for trade so the richest of the rich stay rich. Yes, oil has some part, but you’ve got to look at the bigger picture.
3111 2018-02-12 17:42:44 It was always to put America (the USA) in the first place. 
- The USA wanted to be superior to the Soviet Union -> Cold War
it resulted in the establishment of Al Kaida.
- The USA wanted to control the oil wells in Irak -> First Irak War
It resulted in the establishment of ISIS.

3128 2018-02-12 17:40:18 Additionally, oil-price-driven EOR doesn’t incentivize injecting any more CO2 than is needed for production. That and EV-driven oil demand reduction make it important that we also have a CO2 price driving more CO2-intensive EOR/EGR: basically “sequestration with benefits”.

3143 2018-02-12 17:38:20 Boldest because it is yet another scam to take away more environmental regulations and steal money from transit to put more cars and trucks on the roads so big oil can profit. You're not fooling anybody.

Sometimes I walk around in wet underpants for a few minutes, but the oil idea is interesting. Put it on before bed?

3182 2018-02-12 17:34:11 There is a difference. Ca hikes gas taxes to subsidize everything but infrastructure. Also, as we rely less on foreign oil our domestic supply will increase lowering oil prices. Maybe a small bump in export tax also as long as it keeps us competitive in the global market.

3184 2018-02-12 17:34:06 Upside of servicing vehicle at dealership, genuine parts & service and free coffee. Downside, I don't drink coffee and the wait time is ridiculous for an oil change.

3191 2018-02-12 17:33:04 Like qpr had oil money and got relegated
3192 2018-02-12 17:33:00 This is seriously nuts. They claimed she was using personal comments, but that just seems like a bad excuse to shut her down. Big oil wins again.
3193 2018-02-12 17:32:59 When you get oil down for lunch 
3194 2018-02-12 17:32:57 To be fair, I wouldn't move into any building previously occupied by the Trumps without a proper sage and oil cleansing.

All the exorcism in the world won't protect you from the evil you carry in your own heart.

3208 2018-02-12 17:31:20 I started with daily fish oil, vitamin c, and a multi. Was so tired of being sick I would have tried anything.
3209 2018-02-12 17:31:18 Yup, big Dutch multinational. They were cooperative with Greenpeace and other groups on sustainable palm oil. I think they’re not as bad as the rest.
3210 2018-02-12 17:31:17 Apart from oil prices, the monsoon rains would be the key factor for inflation.
3211 2018-02-12 17:31:09 America-We the People must shift our attention to a Oil Company that is basically the top dogs of the Anunnaki Crime Squad... Remember this name    GENIE OIL & GAS...

3218 2018-02-12 17:30:21 After washing my face with coconut oil: I still have acne?? What the fuck??? What?????? What the FUCK?
3219 2018-02-12 17:30:19 Coconut oil may help, doesn't hurt to try. I know it helps canker sores.
3220 2018-02-12 17:30:18 The beginning of summer and the beginning of winter are rough for me. What’s helped this year is using cetaphil moisturizing cream then coconut oil on my body. And for super itchy spots I’ve been using CeraVe ointment.

*Grabs the kitchen lighter from within the drawer and notices it's drenched in oil, as if they'd cooked with gallons of it and then touched it all over with their big oily hands*

... Great.

3256 2018-02-12 17:24:52 They don't waste the oil. They cook with it. Instead of buying fresh groundnut oil
3257 2018-02-12 17:24:48 I dont recommend having your mouth open when pulling a drain plug from an oil pan, I think I’m dying #LubeTings
3258 2018-02-12 17:24:48 I have serious issues with dryness. Have you tried mixing some oil into your lotion? I use Burt's Bees body oil and it helps. For my face the ONLY thing that helps is using coconut oil before I wash at night and then using Dermalogica Ultra Calming Serum before I moisturize.

3260 2018-02-12 17:24:20 What are your thoughts on CBD Oil and treatment of Hashimotos?
3261 2018-02-12 17:24:14 Yeah, I typically check for sales and buy the oil in advance. I feel like I should just invest and start doing it myself. Maybe in the summer.
3262 2018-02-12 17:24:03 How far I need coconut oil sef.
3263 2018-02-12 17:23:58 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
3264 2018-02-12 17:23:52 This oil change is taking mad long
3265 2018-02-12 17:23:48 Where their counterpart state like Ogun is attracting foreign investment into their own state, they're busy battling for hegemony. Education zero, Agric 'Odo' & no oil for dem to rely on. Roofs continue to be brown. Since d advent of Cocoa House & Broken House no new skyscraper.

3268 2018-02-12 17:23:19 I sweat canola oil
3269 2018-02-12 17:22:59 It has a unique taste. It thickens and gives palm oil a yellowish colour. Some people use to to cook beans because they say it makes hard food get done faster.
3270 2018-02-12 17:22:45 You should really read about Palm oil!!  also I know you made this video to give your viewers some inspiration for vday but you should make treat/recipe videos where YOULL actually eat the treats since you don't eat the treats you make because of your diet. Hope that makes sens
3271 2018-02-12 17:22:28 Are you satisfied by the gvt proposal to reduce oil share to the host community from 10% to 5% & further 20%-10% towards the county gvt of Turkana thru petroleum amendment bill to be introduced to Parliament?..@JamesLokwale @Smattlaw @TurkanaCountyKE

3274 2018-02-12 17:22:03 I made my own rosewater at one point &would use it from everything from a toner &to rehydrate curls. Fresh aloe will help. Oh &PLS DO NOT PUT COCONUT OIL ON YOUR FACE. Coconut oil is not a hydrant, it’s a sealant so u can easily develop acne w/it in no time.
3275 2018-02-12 17:21:45 Anybody’s thoughts on CBD oil? Is anybody use  it. Does anybody know anything about it?
3276 2018-02-12 17:21:45 looking at historic photos of oil drilling is always wild as hell. there'll be like 15 derricks right next to each other and just vast unlined pits of sludge
3277 2018-02-12 17:21:42 She is intimidated by a man, a trillionaire who only wants to use her and throw her away when he is done with her. He makes unwanted advances, to which she says, “No.” He forces himself on her, and she doesn’t have the strength to resist. Oil pipelines. Canada. #metoo

3279 2018-02-12 17:21:31 Agree! Could congress review all the bills passed that have added revenues that were strung along and nobody read about! No supplementing oil, rich farmers or any other money drawing hogs off of our system.

3296 2018-02-12 17:18:45 Oh so a combination type of skin. I’d suggest a tea tree oil cleanser (like Trader Joe’s brand) rosewater or witch hazel to tone and moisturize with aloe or an oil free moisturizer & don’t forget to use a sunscreen! Most of the prods I mention r better natural/fresh.

3314 2018-02-12 17:15:59 I thought all essential oils were plant-based... anyway only one oil for me Young living. Unless out of stock then Do-terra. I like the "piney" smells like Cypress, Balsalm Fir, Black Spruce, Idaho Blue Spruce and Sacred Frankincense if I can get it.
3315 2018-02-12 17:15:51 Cheap oil: wait till it's on sale at can tire. You can get a 4L brand name jug for <$15.

3324 2018-02-12 17:14:41 Transmutation:

Grapes must be crushed to make wine. 
Diamonds form under pressure. 
Olives are pressed to release oil. 
Seeds grow in darkness. 
Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed, or in darkness, you're in a powerful place of transformation/transmutation. 

3325 2018-02-12 17:14:39 All communities are entitled to grow and benefit from their God-given resources be they fertile land, forests, minerals or, as the case of Turkana, oil.

3327 2018-02-12 17:14:28 It’s hard to even buy 5.5 quarts of decent oil for less than $20, so no wonder that they’re gone. I prefer to do my own as well, but it’s not for everyone. The PetroCan on Quinpool is supposedly good.
3328 2018-02-12 17:14:24 I went to Island yesterday to buy...it is terrible of a country "producing oil"

3330 2018-02-12 17:14:16 If my skin could stop overproducing oil that would be mcfreakin lit
3331 2018-02-12 17:14:08 @UKenyatta is attempting to place the entitlements of the host communities and the County Governments at the mercy of the executive arm of the National Government. Why reduce Turkana oil benefits from 10% to 5% ? Where is @EAukot?
3332 2018-02-12 17:14:05 thinking if i should burn midnight oil or nah
3333 2018-02-12 17:14:03 The only team thats used oil money is City! Ha how ironic. I put as much money as u want on a bet that Jose wins the league in his time here? Deal?
3334 2018-02-12 17:13:37 I wanna oil up someone's daughter this week.

3339 2018-02-12 17:12:47 Stuart Varney says debt bomb is out there.... spending is out of control.  We need to reign in and get to a balanced budget.  What is the plan to pay down our debt?  New oil production revenues ?? @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @VP @stevenmnuchin1 @MickMulvaneyOMB @Marcshort45
3340 2018-02-12 17:12:36 there's no forced starvation, covfegee. there was however a massive famine caused by the dissolution of the USSR leading to a sharp increase in oil prices that wrecked havoc on their mechanized farming. they also have very little ariable land
3341 2018-02-12 17:12:17 The rare occasion you'd see Kiyo go goofily frantic? This

"I-I think I added the wrong oil, and it started flaming!!"
3342 2018-02-12 17:12:03 How about you get COMPANIES to DRILL for NIGERIAN OIL then you would not have this Problem - CONCENTRATE ON BIGGER THINGS!!!!!! NNPC= USELESS
3343 2018-02-12 17:11:58 For me I use 1 drop Tea Tree essential Oil + 2 drops of peppermint essential oil and vitamin E oil! Pure Vitamin E oil is thick and sticky so you might like almond or jojoba oil instead.
3344 2018-02-12 17:11:58 I had been contemplating the switch to solar energy for my home this year. I likely won't be able to afford it now. I don't want oil any longer, so I will have to settle for something in between due to this.

3351 2018-02-12 17:11:07 We should be very concerned with our environment and work to save it with clean energy! We can make the transition from dirty gas and oil to electric cars and wind turbines, etc!
3352 2018-02-12 17:11:05 This legislation is .  Everyone needs to be responsible for pollution, especially those that strip, dig to mine, extract minerals,oil,natural gas, H2O. Dump waste into rivers, bury in the ground, burn into our air.

3361 2018-02-12 17:09:57 I’ve been using safflower oil, which is similar to sunflower oil. It’s has a 0 rating on the comedogenic scale which means it doesn’t clog at all but it still is very moisturizing and treats dark spots and inflammation which cleaning pores!

My question is, what is
'I got money in oil: Akara'

What is that?
3379 2018-02-12 17:08:17 I guess today is a good day to change my oil and run all my errands

3382 2018-02-12 17:07:54 That’s funny. It shows your true self. You have no clue who I am, nor my accomplishments. Yet what can be expected from an obvious jerk like yourself.  Ive never had a boss. I ran my businesses. You?
3383 2018-02-12 17:07:38 The major powers should intervene and teach the bully of the region a lesson. 
UNLESS they don’t really want additional oil/gas capacity to reach the market that is already experiencing a supply glut and they’re using Turkey’s territorial ambitions to promote their interests.
3384 2018-02-12 17:07:31 Scotland had and has no part in this xenophobic fearfest,we voted 62% for remain-we never bought the “snake oil” they sold successfully flogged to England...
3385 2018-02-12 17:07:17 Silicon based is fab and shouldn’t dry as fast as water based, but everyone’s body reacts differently to these things. I personally love using Gun Oil Force Rekon, it’s a hybrid silicon lubricant
3386 2018-02-12 17:07:12 It don’t take long to get an oil change and rotate tires  i got shit to do
3387 2018-02-12 17:07:08 - get a prize for participation
3388 2018-02-12 17:07:07 How about using for free energy? Hasn't the government been working on that project.

Imagine the savings to tax payers through money and environmental impact.

Oh wait liberals use the clean energy sector as their oil sector. Nevermind.
3389 2018-02-12 17:07:05 I feel oils differ, I use olive oil in my face scrubs and I don’t break out. I moisturize with raw she’s butter and it doesn’t cause breakouts. Coconut oil however hates my face but works on my body!  Use what oils work best for your skin, as our skin is all different
3390 2018-02-12 17:07:02 Dealerships have the best oil.
3391 2018-02-12 17:06:53 Nope. Argan I pakai masa keluar. Sapu sikit sikit. Coconut oil dua kali seminggu macam tu. pakai overnight. Esok pagi basuh shampoo macam biasa.
3392 2018-02-12 17:06:51 Very wrong maglagay ng face oil. Init na init ako ngayon!!!
3393 2018-02-12 17:06:26 Thanks to @NdutaKimani I've remembered to oil my beard for the first time this year. Good looking out fam.
3394 2018-02-12 17:06:25 RT  climate change denial isn't a brave unorthodoxy, it's a cynical pile of shit funded by the oil companies, who are not brave unorthodox truth sayers, they are rich and powerful and able to murder ppl who are inconvenient to them
3395 2018-02-12 17:06:09 Conservatism is a hoax & DJT is a snake oil salesman
3396 2018-02-12 17:06:08 Tall need some real men in y’all life cus ion pay for oil changes lol
3397 2018-02-12 17:06:02 You’re a better person than me. I’d have been like: “I know you’re lying piece of oil lobbying shit.” But I would said it nicely.
3398 2018-02-12 17:05:46 Right so why state every oil thing you do or someone else. Its on camera. Pringles.
3399 2018-02-12 17:05:39 The asshat who gave #blackpanther that bogus review is probably related to the dumbass who made the $100 bid for the barrel of oil back in 2008. Just wanna make history for the wrong reason.
3400 2018-02-12 17:05:36 Does anyone else agree that the portraits are just very bad? For the official portraits of president and first lady

Understand the need for rotating tires as Well? 
I believe you sir have a great platform to make a run deep in Presidential campaign!! 
Lol!
3402 2018-02-12 17:05:32 I have combination skin! But I only put that remedy directly on active pimples. Not all over my face! You could try lavender oil and a different carrier oil, sweet almond works well for oily skin! I don’t like coconut oil

3404 2018-02-12 17:05:16 Yes hello Halifax, where is the most affordable place to get your oil changed? I've always gone to Canadian Tire, but wondering if there's a better option (Please no jokes about how anything is better than Crappy Tire, just good suggestions if you have them). Thanks!
3405 2018-02-12 17:05:06 Of course! Absolutely there is NO doubt that US openly stole from Iraqi Central Bank, oil, Antiquities and confiscated all iraq's investments& assets in the West & US that is worth BILLIONS of dollars. They continued that corrupted policies today! Thieves they don't have honor!
3406 2018-02-12 17:04:36 I would if I could, I already flattened the layers down! That and... I really don't want to use that accursed oil brush again sowwy ;-;
3407 2018-02-12 17:04:32 Other oils that are very comedogenic is olive oil and rosehip, and coconut oil!
3408 2018-02-12 17:04:25 He’s the ultimate fox in charge of the henhouse. Is against EPA’s mission. Wastes money on expensive travel, often on behalf of the oil & gas industry. You can tell where his loyalty is. Knows this job is just to tee up the next job/payday.
3409 2018-02-12 17:04:19 I was productive today, oil change and scheduled the brakes too.  

Car washed.... but the weather is looking to change 

Scheduled the fixing of my little bear, ash (kitty) 

Even got a coffee.
3410 2018-02-12 17:04:07 neroli oil is a scientifically proven serotonin booster! if you can find a candle w that oil you can use that but it has a very distinct/pungent scent. lush has a few items it’s in too. id recommend therapy message bar, happy happy joy joy conditioner or love & light hand lotion

3415 2018-02-12 17:02:56 Your remarks about domestic refining are without merit, hypocritical and simple political posturing. The Greens were opposed to the Energy East project, which would have supplied domestic refineries and displaced unethical oil.

3417 2018-02-12 17:02:52 Why in Colombia is the United States preparing an invasion to Venezuela to steal the Oil? If Colombia is the problem by its narcowar and their production of cocaine

3421 2018-02-12 17:02:50 Nothing trumps the feeling good feedback gives.
Especially when you burnt the mid night oil, then under played expectations.
3422 2018-02-12 17:02:45 Amen. For a President who constantly talks about making America great again and who has pulled away from other countries why do we have military all over the world? Perhaps it is about oil and money.
3423 2018-02-12 17:02:23 The guy who is changing my car’s oil is from my hometown and went to my “rival” high school or whatever and when I made a comment about how I didn’t care about football he looked so crestfallen I genuinely felt bad like damn I’m sorry Nathan.....
3424 2018-02-12 17:02:23 WM elite have been stealing Scotlands oil revenue for 40 yrs, Where's it gone, a crime against the welfare of all Scottish people over those 40yrs
3425 2018-02-12 17:02:20 When I was a kid during the first oil crisis, a lot of people carpooled. But now we all use our car time as phone time, and that makes carpooling much less attractive.

3430 2018-02-12 17:01:51 Just a heads up, if you have oily skin, pure vitamin e oil is a no no. It is very comodogenic, which means it clogs pores. I have very oily skin. Tea tree broke me out terribly BUT not sure if that had anything to do with me being oily or just being allergic to it period
3431 2018-02-12 17:01:51 If you're bored with salad, try grilling romaine lettuce with a little grapeseed oil. Add sea salt and enjoy!

3436 2018-02-12 17:01:25 So we are back to wanting a strong CAD? Ok. Plan A: Call it the AAA MegaSuperDollar Plus. Or, Plan B: Develop a plan to get oil to market (crush that WCS/WTI discount) and reduce economic reliance on real estate. Either plan works.
3437 2018-02-12 17:01:24 Hhh I’m just gonna chip in and add I literally use just a simple tea tree oil cleanser + toner and an overnight moisturiser from The Body Shop and literally it’s less stress, hassle and does wonders for my skin.
3438 2018-02-12 17:01:19 Exactly true , it's not the end of the world.

3440 2018-02-12 17:01:09 I've been trying to get into the habit of using cuticle oil a couple times a day and that helps a lot - I got a whole bunch of the brush pen kind on wish and I keep one by my bed, one in my purse, one on my end table, etc. LOL

3461 2018-02-12 16:59:43 Whoever painted Michelle - cut his fingers off and lock-up his paint brushes! I think it is terrible. - Barack seems ok in oil.
3462 2018-02-12 16:59:42 Finished another book. Submitted two articles on time. Began my week’s ‘day job’ work. Bought three oil paintings. Meditated. 

I’d say it was a good Monday. 

Goodnight from Cambodia, friends.
3463 2018-02-12 16:59:42 Fucking vegetable oil

3465 2018-02-12 16:59:37 I want to see a breakdown of financial benefits to us. None forthcoming. Must all be going to big oil companies in US.

3469 2018-02-12 16:59:32 Strange country:
November 2008: satellite we built for 40 billion disappears

September 2004: Ship laden with 30,000 barrels of oil disappears 

August 2017: Rats chase the President out of office 

February 2018: Snake swallows 36 million from JAMB

I need a beer..
3470 2018-02-12 16:59:29 Public land is preserved for its beauty for ALL to enjoy, not for greedy oil and gas to destroy
3471 2018-02-12 16:59:28 Way to go Doug !!!
3472 2018-02-12 16:59:04 Watching copious amounts of makeup/skin products being hawked on The View.  Does it make me less female because I never gave a rat's ass about such money-wasting snake oil products?
3473 2018-02-12 16:58:52 a tactic used by Mussolinis men to discourage reds ,instead of beating them up they were dosed with castor oil? many afterwards said they preffered the beating up? its a good punishment for the very naughty?
3474 2018-02-12 16:58:27 Perhaps they gave Florida more opioids? Maybe the oil barons load up mind-numbing aluminum to spray on them? Maybe the fluoride in their water is doing the trick? Locking up blacks stops protests. The 60's was our last real protest. They have it figured out. They are winning.
3475 2018-02-12 16:58:15 I love olives but what are they good for besides oil? Lmao
3476 2018-02-12 16:57:55 For those customers that use Amsoil signature oil but not the filter recommended please remember to change the filter at 10,000 miles or before and top off the oil.
Enjoy the open road.
3477 2018-02-12 16:57:49 But is it a 'relaxing' bath oil. Don't want any of that energizing stuff.
3478 2018-02-12 16:57:33 You might need that Wild Growth Oil for that thinning baby
3479 2018-02-12 16:57:25 Thanks to your fellow Republicans for wasting $7,000,000,000,000. Wonder if the oil company profits are the same amount.
3480 2018-02-12 16:57:21 @bobbycannavale 3 in 1 oil, what else? 
3481 2018-02-12 16:57:20 How sad that teachers are now being used as pawns to protect the profits of the oil and gas industry. The worst part is, this may unfortunately be the best deal that Republicans are willing to consider for our state. Groan. #okleg #stepupoklahoma
3482 2018-02-12 16:57:15 The Saturn ION's oil filter housing is cheap plastic because bean counters decided that a metal one was too expensive.
3483 2018-02-12 16:57:11 Maybe the Liberals need to remind our citizenry that we will continue to use carbon based fuels for many decades to come? They have so demonized oil that opposition thinks they are literally battling for their lives. No-one believes the Liberals want to extract our resources.

3496 2018-02-12 16:55:36 Big oil is very thankful that his plan takes money from transit in order to get more cars and trucks on the road.

Pricks.
3497 2018-02-12 16:55:36 We've all see oil spots on driveways & parking lots. Oil leaks end up in storm drains, and then our lakes & rivers. If your car has sprung a leak, get it fixed immediately.

3499 2018-02-12 16:55:33 Stupidity? Really? Preservation and control over Mid East Oil don’t be called in that way. Remember the power of Democracy values
3500 2018-02-12 16:55:25 Paraguay importa muchisimo gas oil....raro...

3505 2018-02-12 16:54:40 Snake swallowed 36 million Naira in Jamb the same way 130 million liters of petrol evaporated in capital oil. Nigerians are bent on destroying Nigeria.
3506 2018-02-12 16:54:37 What is required is the division of Iraq, I wish the society completely collapsed the poor and the oil, and only abundant to the scourge How threatens the US-Maliki al-Maliki in Vietnam New - Never Opened
3507 2018-02-12 16:54:30 Despots,only interested in oil and resources of other nations
3508 2018-02-12 16:54:20 I never worshipped coconut oil.
3509 2018-02-12 16:54:15 I feel like I'm overly happy and annoying sometimes oof
3510 2018-02-12 16:54:12 Saw an ad of his yesterday. He was talking about the BP oil spill, which is surely gonna be very fresh in voters' minds in 2018.
3511 2018-02-12 16:54:04 Funny that you run an Indian nation ID. I also laugh that you tag me "liberal". I'm a social and fiscal conservative. Lean Republican, but have a science background, so I do tend to disagree with the big oil portion of platform. 
 My nieces are half NA Viejas.
3512 2018-02-12 16:54:02 Oil exploration is banned in Antarctica!
3513 2018-02-12 16:53:49 This morning started off kinda rough, phone stopped working and I spilled a good amount of my expensive body oil  so yoga is imperititve today
3514 2018-02-12 16:53:44 If CO2 footprint were attributed to the consumer country, then Eastern CDN refineries, who import 700,000 Barrels/day foreign oil (by sea/rail) would have  incentive to use CDN (AB) oil, thus keeping $billions in Canada.  Energy east pipe would be built in no time.

3518 2018-02-12 16:53:18 Sure.. Republicans trying to start yet another war to jack up the price of oil.

3522 2018-02-12 16:52:47 Suggest any cleansing oil?
3523 2018-02-12 16:52:44 Releasing National Park land for Oil and Gas profit is Disgusting.

3525 2018-02-12 16:52:35 Oh it’s amazing!! I was like a child on Christmas morning!! Watch this space as I have a key ring to make ... and there is amazing bath oil to help aching muscles  which contain fir oil. So perfect. Oh and llama stickers amongst other things. It’s a real little treasure chest. 
3526 2018-02-12 16:52:33 *looks at skin*

Once I find me a supply of snake oil I'm set.
3527 2018-02-12 16:52:24 there are isolated islands in the pacific that are palm oil plantations
5 gets you 10, the farm workers are slave laborers 
many of those islands are still under french control, and are difficult to get to, or to get permits to get to
3528 2018-02-12 16:52:20 Just wait until tonight when the Oil lay an egg on home ice against a team they should beat...again
3529 2018-02-12 16:52:16 Bene Tabarelli ribadisce che view di #Eni oramai sta nella ricerca bacini ergo livello suo team geologi

Ancora molti operatori finanziari si ostinano a vederla solo come compagnia petrolifera e sbagliando correlare suo valore al prezzo a #Oil
3530 2018-02-12 16:52:04 Disgusting that you think Oil and Gas are more important than park land we can all enjoy. Profit in this case is a sign of Trump Corruption.,
3531 2018-02-12 16:51:58 Oil from the United States rather then shipping it to sell overseas.
3532 2018-02-12 16:51:50 My hair is getting some extra attention today. Hopefully I don’t have to wash it several times later with all the coconut oil I put into it. 
3533 2018-02-12 16:51:50 Told my husband we were getting low on oil literally 20 mins ago, I look outside while I’m sitting on the couch and pioneer valley oil is outside  #damnthatwasquick
3534 2018-02-12 16:51:08 wahoo way too much rain . I seen cats and dogs falling .Need to go get some neem oil 
3535 2018-02-12 16:51:05 LOL, Trump undercut Americans and made America POORER, not great, when he allowed Oil and Gas to buy National Park land for private profit.
3536 2018-02-12 16:51:01 Castor oil cleansing
3537 2018-02-12 16:50:48 @BruceMcCurdy @DavidStaplesYEG just listened to the last podcast. Great passion on the PP discussion. If we weren’t at a tipping point, we should be when on the broadcast Bieksa was interviewed and he smirked when discussing Oil PP. That should end someone’s employment
3538 2018-02-12 16:50:42 I do my Mexican team is like Man City before oil money
3539 2018-02-12 16:50:37 Flexing as a whole is currently on hold until people stop getting their tax returns... we know where u got the money to buy those off-white jordans, dont act like u out here consistently getting this paper when your car is 3,000 miles overdue for an oil change
3540 2018-02-12 16:50:31 Debating shipping my car out to Amy Daws for an oil change.
3541 2018-02-12 16:50:28 Bingo!!  You hit the nail on the head.  Be wary.  There are a lot of supposed health professionals who venture out of their area of expertise and dole out dubious nut advise.  2/5 and what about almond oil?  Fasting is for losers and I get my almond oil by eating almonds.
3542 2018-02-12 16:50:26 Why, in your opinion is the high saturated fat in chocolate ok, but in coconut oil it is not?
3543 2018-02-12 16:50:22 !!!don’t use tea tree oil around or on your dogs!!!
3544 2018-02-12 16:50:18 I always hated coconut oil, could not even stand it in baking, always used butter when recipe called for coconut oil
3545 2018-02-12 16:50:16 Oil will soon be as useless as coal is now. Forget it. Invest in clean energy and people. Both are sustainable.
3546 2018-02-12 16:50:15 Watercolor is the best. Oil on canvas sucks balls.
3547 2018-02-12 16:50:12 @jjhorgan Thank you for protecting BC.  BC rights shud not b ignored In favour of Alberta's oil industry. This law shud b amended. Federal govt protecting Alberta, what about BC?  BP spent billions trying 2 clean up d Gulf coast & it is not done yet.

3550 2018-02-12 16:49:57 The oil & gas index shed -0.16% fueled by the decline in ETERNA (-9.67%). The insurance index was down by 1.05% on the day.
3551 2018-02-12 16:49:57 Some day I'll hit that precious oil vein of comedic gold and I too can be internet famous
The vein seems to be off-brand dril tweets so I know what I must do
3552 2018-02-12 16:49:55 You ignored buying 10% stake in one Abu Dhabi oil company and other deals @sushantsareen
Is there a problem if both the things go hand in hand?
Is the temple bad? Should we be sad about it?

3569 2018-02-12 16:47:13 It's a story that most don't know the ending of and assume it was the oil.  Having said that Fake Olive oil is big business.
3570 2018-02-12 16:47:12 จะเอาาาา
3571 2018-02-12 16:47:10 You entered a thread defending the position that we are worse, whereas I never suggested we were saints. 

If you think we are bombing Pakistan, Somalia, or Libya because we want oil, then you are wrong.
3572 2018-02-12 16:47:08 anyone try that new @kevyn_aucoin oil? is it worth the moolah they're asking for?
3573 2018-02-12 16:47:05 me: i feel like olive oil is the answer to everything now...

3574 2018-02-12 16:47:05 You do coffee? Bulletproof coffee might be a decent thing. A $8 jar of coconut oil will get a lot of mileage.

3578 2018-02-12 16:46:44 did my taxes, bought coconut oil, and made the switch to almond milk 
can't believe my life has turned around so much
3579 2018-02-12 16:46:31 25 million is litteraly a drop in the federal spending budget and the environmental impact is overstated.  Remember how they said deep water horizon oil spill would ruin gulf fishery for decades yet it fully recovered within 3 years.  Nature adapts.
3580 2018-02-12 16:46:22 Very true, bong water is definitely on ofthe grossest tasting things on the planet, and the smell lingers. Definitely cleaning my piece tonight and only using it for oil

3583 2018-02-12 16:46:07 Not to support them just because they have oil and sells it to us cheaply.
3584 2018-02-12 16:46:04 Argan oil and coco oil. And then I basuh hampir setiap hari. Tapi kena tengok jenis shampoo. Make sure yang for everyday use punya. I dulu pakai tresemme tapi i cheapskate so downgrade pakai watson punya je sekarang, murah and macam lagi bagus. 
3585 2018-02-12 16:45:59 #hannn You know these niggas ain’t loyal. Poppa always told me these niggas ain’t for u. That’s why we never mix like water wit the oil. Baby keep that shit mine & imma keep ya ass spoiled. Real one, hold u down like a real army 
3586 2018-02-12 16:45:55 I’ve lived in six cities. Every time I go to the DMV by my house I feel like I’m living a biblical miracle. You got your oil that lasts for 7 nights longer than expected, your multiplications of loaves & fishes, and your in & out of DMV in under 5 minutes. 
3587 2018-02-12 16:45:27 Yeah. The oil money things is old to me. Now all of a sudden ppl care how sports teams are bankrolled when their old historical team has to do a little more work to win. That old money is dirty too

3602 2018-02-12 16:43:22 True, though I'm not advocating for socialism etc either. the point here is to draw attention to the issues of capitalism and that there are people being oppressed by how it operates. Nt jst in the US, my own country Angola experienced civil war because of our oil/diamonds.

3701 2018-02-12 16:31:53 I've come around to the same conclusion. It is the only thing that makes sense, especially when oil/gas corps. openly promote RE in their marketing campaigns (eg. Shell), and investors behind local wind farms include nat. gas money

3743 2018-02-12 16:25:11 The last statement says it all "So we can export oil and natural gas from Russia". We do export oil and natural gas but how can we export from Russia? We can't export FROM Russia, we IMPORT from Russia but NOT oil or natural gas.
3744 2018-02-12 16:25:09 Hey don't complain fixing something when you broke it in the first place. Not to mention the billions of gold, oil, works of art and antiquities that was stolen after the Iraq war. #dumbass
3745 2018-02-12 16:24:46 焼き肉食いながら、笑い話するわけでもなく「俺はこうおもうぜ？」って話を長々出来るってのは中々珍しいよね。
3746 2018-02-12 16:24:44 B-1B costs too much to oil its sliding wings. B-52 is a simple truck.
3747 2018-02-12 16:24:43 The Olive Oil, Peach with blueberry compote!
3748 2018-02-12 16:24:40 Still more oil there than UKOG has I suspect 
3749 2018-02-12 16:24:30 For Trump, I'm thinking a traditional oil portrait of him admiring himself in a mirror while on a rearing horse before adoring crowds as Jesus's hand extends from a cloud to give him the thumbs-up.
3750 2018-02-12 16:24:27 I don't see my view of him changing, unless he gets a total lobotomy. He calls a spade a spade only when it suits him - when it comes to arms and oil deals he loves the Saudis. I wish the Democrats or Bernie Sanders had won. What success are you thinking of? He had bankruptcies.
3751 2018-02-12 16:24:16 Stank ass Fusz oil changes man, this shit is for the fuckin birds.
3752 2018-02-12 16:24:05 Then she had the nerve to oil it down 
3753 2018-02-12 16:24:02 This weather makes my scalp so dry . I need to hydrate tonight with an olive oil treatment 
3754 2018-02-12 16:23:46 Oh Kimber find some oil money will ya... We love ex Spurs at City..... Ask Kyle Walker  @kimbohellyeah @Metallibanger @goc1978
3755 2018-02-12 16:23:34 Not sure on the parallel you are drawing.  Venezuela is a disaster because they rely on 1 export: oil.  The price of which has dropped, and thus crashed their economy.

Just asked in the library where the books on mineral oil were & was told they in in non friction
3759 2018-02-12 16:23:31 Should've been America 1st.Bushes war was purely about oil and greed.
3760 2018-02-12 16:23:25 아니 정말로 다들 철수가 되어버렸잖아
3761 2018-02-12 16:23:24 A Harvard Prof in the tank for both @BarackObama AND big oil (painting). Pick a side!
3762 2018-02-12 16:23:20 Aw, she got her first pro-wrestling shirt! Now all she needs to do is drench her hair in water and oil and she's good to go!
3763 2018-02-12 16:23:19  Turkey that was a partner with ISIS, sharing long stretch of its border for years, buying their oil and helped smuggle in fighters from all over the world. The Turkish regime is now a sad, disgusting, uncivilised laughing-stock!
3764 2018-02-12 16:23:12 I get it.  What is the percent of China oil consumption as a ratio to world consumption since the 2 previous attempts?  What else has  changed?
3765 2018-02-12 16:23:09 Snakeshit rather than Snake Oil for once?
3766 2018-02-12 16:23:08 We use most of the products. All grains  flours oil burra saly masala biscuits breakfast cereals. Almost everything.
3767 2018-02-12 16:22:58 *cleans up the oil then inspects the gauges* Christ. Your oil pressure is through the roof.
3768 2018-02-12 16:22:54 I have to be the biggest advocate for wigs and castor oil, cuz bitch I been through the struggle ok and I’ve seen RESULTS. And the Dominicans ain’t it!
3769 2018-02-12 16:22:49 I'm /mostly/ sure it was the orange oil, but now I'm curious! What teas can eat what spoons?
3770 2018-02-12 16:22:12 This is a strange country. November 2008: satellite we built for 40 billion disappears. September 2004: Ship laden with 30,000 barrels of oil disappears August 2017: Rats chase the President out of office February 2018: Snake swallows 36 million from JAMB. I need a bottle of wine
3771 2018-02-12 16:22:02 The grossest feeling in the world is having greasy hair and being hyper aware of how the strands feel like they’re glued to your head.

A jug of canola oil fell from a shelf this morning and hit my head and I already wanted a shower so now I’m literally dying
3772 2018-02-12 16:21:56 *still coughing up oil*

3778 2018-02-12 16:20:54 Remember Trump's "buy American steel" battle cry for oil and gas pipelines in the US? Neither does he. Trump was never meant to be anything more than a political power grab for the burgeoning US oligarchy, and they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.
3779 2018-02-12 16:20:52 & it’s all about ‘last oil’... #murrika wants it - & #russia wants it...
3780 2018-02-12 16:20:45 Stream will be late today everyone  have to go change my oil in the car . see around ten!

3784 2018-02-12 16:20:16 I need an oil change done.... can you help me?

3787 2018-02-12 16:19:45 *starts to cough up oil, spraying him*
3788 2018-02-12 16:19:45 It is also not right to entertain them... Kenya is a sorveign country... We don't need western envoys to tell us what to do. They have an hidden agenda on our turkana oil
3789 2018-02-12 16:19:42 This oil spill is what Republicans let happen-less regulation, more oil drilling on our coasts-except for Fla-Russian Traitor TRump made sure tacky Mar a Lago was exempt-Disgusting, uncaring & selfish is his normal behavior to Make America Gross Again.
3790 2018-02-12 16:19:36 Well back to 5-30 oil I go!
3791 2018-02-12 16:19:32 Aunty Kemi advice Baba to build refinery in all geo political zones. This would answer many problems. Why should Country like ours continue to refined our own crude oil outside our Country. Stop encouraging oil theft by the pirates.
3792 2018-02-12 16:19:29 Okay, I just found an account called @darkstockphotos and why do these even exist? I’m trying so hard not to burst out laughing in the waiting room of the dealership while getting my oil changed

3798 2018-02-12 16:18:27 ありがとう〜一本だけルールだから任せて！！
3799 2018-02-12 16:18:26 The money in oil industry dwarfs anything in “green” renewable energy. Especially when it comes to campaign contributions and lobbyists. Dems and reps are both guilty of being bought. The tariff on solar panels is a great example of how the fix is in.
3800 2018-02-12 16:18:13 Bit by bit, the U.S. petroleum industry is turning world #oil markets inside out. Now, surging U.S. exports – largely banned by Washington until just two years ago - challenge the last region #OPEC dominates: Asia.
3801 2018-02-12 16:18:03 Psalm 55:21  The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.
3802 2018-02-12 16:18:00 Malema need anointing oil & holy water cause is fading now. 
How can a mad person say judge his ex?
3803 2018-02-12 16:17:41 Notice that we've basically made no progress since... Well the moon landings. I mean 1900's, in 60 years planes had been invented, the jet engine, nuclear weapons and humans on the moon. Apparently we need a huge amount of death before we can be better. Or MONEY YAY! Fuck oil!
3804 2018-02-12 16:17:41 Smoked a moonrock joint dipped in hash oil and covered in kief at the beach yesterday 
3805 2018-02-12 16:17:39 Why don't you have any depots past central belt of Scotland? Would have thought oil and gas and timber falling would have been something you would have tried to expand Into
3806 2018-02-12 16:17:37 The Petri dish of modern fake news is the “natural” health media. A hive of quackery and up-is-downism in the service of selling the newest iteration of snake oil.
3807 2018-02-12 16:17:34 I’m getting an oil change rn n feeling like such an adult.
3808 2018-02-12 16:17:34 Like bitch nothing is wrong with my car, change my oil and STFU 
3809 2018-02-12 16:17:21 Swear that man use oil paint or something, it nah coming off 
3810 2018-02-12 16:17:19 Because the oil lobby and all the other fossil fuel lobbies don’t want us to. That’s why. It’s all about money and the entire Trump administration is holding the door wide open.

3812 2018-02-12 16:17:01 My scalp is so dry. Doing a hot oil treatment tonight. I hate when my scalp ain’t moisturized.
3813 2018-02-12 16:16:43 Trump still thinks coal is the future.....
China leads the world in Solar power
Trump puts taxe on solar panels 
His America first means putting money in the oil industry's pockets 
And his swampland buddies 
Just shows how uneducated Trump is
Puppet Master is very happy
3814 2018-02-12 16:16:35 Yeah. Sad they can't handle someone calling them out for what they are...puppets to big oil and a bit of $$ thrown their way. The word 'whore' comes to mind.
3815 2018-02-12 16:16:35 Though with the amount of olive oil involved that’s impractical.
3816 2018-02-12 16:16:33 Face scrub, witch hazel and bio oil.
3817 2018-02-12 16:16:32 さて、帰るか。と言っても、ホテルへ帰るわけなんですがね。
3818 2018-02-12 16:16:31 I walked in for my oil change appt and was immediately greeted with “Hi Ms. April” and was caught all the way off guard  like the guy doesn’t have my info and clearly saw my car pull in 
3819 2018-02-12 16:16:04 BIO OIL IS THE BEST THING FOR YOUR FACE!!! It really helps
3820 2018-02-12 16:16:02 Jaggerbomb!

3822 2018-02-12 16:15:56 NFL needs to let this young man back in the league. I swear the owners only mad that he has oil money and they don’t.
3823 2018-02-12 16:15:56 Offshore energy exploration will result in the inevitable oil spill or drilling platform blow-out that blackened the Gulf and killed wildlife and tourism.
3824 2018-02-12 16:15:32 Apparently I look like a rabbit, the amount of undressed depressing side salads I’ve been served this week.

Unless a bowl of dry leaves appeals to you, take some olive oil and a bit lemon juice, 3:1 ratio, shake it up and make a basic damn dressing in 30 seconds. It’s not hard.
3825 2018-02-12 16:15:25 According to sources close to the President, oil drilling is slated to begin off the coast of Palm Beach beginning in 2020.
3826 2018-02-12 16:15:23 So how many of us have noticed the price of fuel increasing now?

Im also reading that the U.S. is the 2nd highest exporter of oil...

If that is true, why are our fuel prices rising?  Why are we still importing?

I thought Trump wanted oil independance
3827 2018-02-12 16:15:18 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.
3828 2018-02-12 16:15:16 พี่แก้มตลกอ่ะ
3829 2018-02-12 16:15:10 imo just plain old shorts trying their best, we will crush them by lunch, Bond mkt is coperating with us today (and even €/$ now & oil)
3830 2018-02-12 16:15:09 Did you just see @WVGOP throw out a Dem candidate for having a list of legislators beholden 2 oil industry? DEMS don't do that!
If @GOP does not enmasse try to perpetrate evil on the American public, why did the Ryan House vote as block to get rid of ethics ofc the very 1st nite?
3831 2018-02-12 16:15:04 Not even an end to diesel trains, but to diesel-only trains. So loads of diesel-powered bi-modes burning more fuel because of carrying the extra bi-mode weight around without wires. More government snake oil, like from you with the IEPs
3832 2018-02-12 16:14:56 Gotta get an oil change
3833 2018-02-12 16:14:40 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
3834 2018-02-12 16:14:17 So uhhh just Incase someone doesn’t know, you should check oil after driving instead of before (‘:
3835 2018-02-12 16:13:58 Take the time to clean and oil one Damascus steel knife and you will thoroughly understand why knights had squires #medievalproblems #mondays #mylifeisstrange
3836 2018-02-12 16:13:57 Nope. As I said already its delivered much better tax take this last quarter with costs cut and oil hovering around $70pb
3837 2018-02-12 16:13:45 Environmentalists aim to protect the globe while oil industries literally kill millions a year with pollution and contaminated water... not the same but nice try :)

3843 2018-02-12 16:12:36 I think you need leadership, commitment, vision and inspiration from local business, entrepreneurs, and all levels of local govt, including economic growth, culture and tourism. Or we can do nothing and continue to be at mercy of world oil & gas prices.

3850 2018-02-12 16:12:07 @tvcnewsng NNPC can not import enough fuel that will service the nation even when all their allocated (450K) crude oil barrel are refined and returned to the country.#JH
3851 2018-02-12 16:12:05 So @UKenyatta rejected 10% local benefits to Turkana people with respect to oil ? Where is the loud mouthed @EAukot to fight for the rights of the marginalized ?
3852 2018-02-12 16:11:44 No, the problem is that the American people, in their folly, decided that wealth was the proper measure of a person's credibility, creating a world for themselves in which a network of successful snake oil salesmen and well connected ex-frat boys became seen as the source ...

3885 2018-02-12 16:07:05 Kudos to @TIAA being a most ethical company! How does this apply to your "Social Choice Low Carbon Equity Fund" holding shares in Oil & Gas Sector companies such as Schlumberger Ltd., Earth's largest oilfield services company? Thanks. 
3886 2018-02-12 16:06:57 Yep. But they tried. China too. But at least China wants the oil! Solidarity!

3899 2018-02-12 16:06:29 Trump administration has released its infrastructure plan. The plan is nothing more than a scam to open up even more of our public lands to Big Oil. Trump lied to SD Indians.He wants to allow pipelines to cross the National State Parks.
Please CALL Senate to stop 2-Faced politics
3900 2018-02-12 16:06:27 My barista just put CBD oil in my tea... on my way to work. That's Seattle I guess.
3901 2018-02-12 16:06:10 The problem with all the creamy moisturising masks I've ever heard of is that they've always got oil in there, it's a bit misleading because they talk about hydration, but really they're for hydration and nourishment, so not ideal for oily + dehydrated!
3902 2018-02-12 16:06:07 Dang, i know someone that’s Selling his ! If interested.
3903 2018-02-12 16:06:06 Surprised you listen to him. He comes across like a snake oil salesman.
3904 2018-02-12 16:05:57 Maybe today is looking up. Brought my car in for an oil change and for the first freaking time they took my car right back

3907 2018-02-12 16:05:41 I got my lunch pills today - fish oil memory pills with Ginko, multivitamin, Vitamin C and Vitamin D.  Being 36 is not what I thought it would be.
3908 2018-02-12 16:05:29 We can agree that the Obamas are better humans in a lot of ways than the Trumps

but

do not forget that Obama was happy to sit by while Morton County police were brutalizing NDNs every day on behalf of an oil company?

His words were "let it play out".

Stop canonizing him.

3911 2018-02-12 16:05:04 How about supporting solar and wing energy and reduce oil imports... importing 8 million barrels of oil per day and then burning it is not a good idea!
3912 2018-02-12 16:04:46 I'll try it with coconut oil and if it doesn't work I'll google xx

3936 2018-02-12 16:02:06 Doesn't look all that promising. Chiarelli's mismanagement of the Oil will force Yamamoto into the lineup next fall, ready or not.
3937 2018-02-12 16:01:55 They have spent years lying about the EU. When we leave the EU who will they blame for their mess after the oil runs out

3939 2018-02-12 16:01:39 If we abandon our military presence & thereby also the Petrodollar arrangement with Middle Eastern oil producers, then won't our Dollar implode under the weight of our debt as was evident to everyone in the world at the time Nixon took us off the gold standard and made this deal?
3940 2018-02-12 16:01:38 The Olympic standard is up to 40 ounces now, I think.
3941 2018-02-12 16:01:30 Dear PM you visited oil  nations is it possible reduce the price by them or by your government can u consult with your best astrologer pls
3942 2018-02-12 16:01:27 I am changing my laundry detergent over to Thieves oil based and real wool dryer balls.  John’s skin is sensitive to almost everything...so hopefully this change will help clear up his skin.

3944 2018-02-12 16:01:15 Will do. Can’t wait to try it :) I think I’m going to start by trying it in my oil and vinegar salad dressing. Thanks again. My best to you and your family.
3945 2018-02-12 16:01:10 because you have a short, well trimmed beard. Beard oil/balm is needed for longer beards.
3946 2018-02-12 16:01:07 But, unlike this Administration, no one will be immune, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
3947 2018-02-12 16:00:46 Surely you can handle 16 ounces if you want to be Olympic caliber.
3948 2018-02-12 16:00:44 Now I know not to put plastic spoons in a bag of tea with orange oil, long-term. Good To Know.

3965 2018-02-12 15:59:43 Finally decided to get an oil change. I didn’t even have to get out of my car and it literally took 5 mins!
3966 2018-02-12 15:59:41 We're watching oil costs & trends in government expenditure. The rate hikes in the U.S & the fiscal policy announced by them could disrupt global markets & developing countries. US policy mix had previously led to turmoil, that the risks are bigger now #lka

4065 2018-02-12 15:50:11 Yeah. I was at the other one but passed on this one. I've heard these stories enough. Will cut the Oil a bit of a break on this as it was more an NHL thing rather than a Oilers thing. But your right...thats enough.
4066 2018-02-12 15:50:01 Yeah all natural. And I mix it with coconut oil

4068 2018-02-12 15:49:53 I do think that especially with a darker beard the oil gives it an attractive shine (i’m not sure it would be noticeable on lighter hair), plus it smells nice

4118 2018-02-12 15:44:29 Olive doesn’t smell too great. Get something like lavender oil that smells good and has calming/soothing qualities. You’ll have to dilute is because essential oils are too strong for direct contact so mix it with a carrier oil like avocado. It’s scentless and is great for ur skin

4168 2018-02-12 15:37:51 The oil is the best part!
4169 2018-02-12 15:37:48 Makes perfect sense as long as we open up drilling and keep more of our oil, build new refineries and lower gas prices.
4170 2018-02-12 15:37:46 A typical #victoriapark #london dad telling his kids 'too much oil on the fish, gross' alas you took them to the fish and chippy? #parentingskills

4172 2018-02-12 15:37:44 3 drops of Oregano Oil, 1 drop of Frankincense oil mixed in tea or water, if you're not on any antibiotics, 4x/day. Doesn't taste great & burns a little at first, but it will knock out virtually anything. 3 days & you're feeling better. 10 days & you're Hulk Hogan again.
4173 2018-02-12 15:37:44 @WellnessExpoCda are you the nutjobs featuring the idiot murderer as a speaker? I mean, I wouldn't expect much better, coming from a bunch of snake oil salesmen, but c'mon!

4182 2018-02-12 15:36:49 Marsh, even now, with his club owned by an oil rich country, no limits to what they will spend and winning the league at a trot, is green with envy and bitter towards United. Because United has what City can never buy- a history, tradition and culture of achievement.

4197 2018-02-12 15:35:34 Actually the infrastructure in Europe (trains etc) has been ahead of USA since the 1950s when big oil started calling the shots — no mass transit. Cars that burn gasoline.
4198 2018-02-12 15:35:19 I mean.
My face has oil on it.
Dawn soap cuts through tough grease and grime.
Makes sense right?
4199 2018-02-12 15:35:05 Trump 3-D Chess.  Calling for a Military Parade as a strategy to openly expose that the US is run by the Military Industrial Complex? Maybe they can parade some war captives and captured booty (aka Oil drums and Banker loans)
4200 2018-02-12 15:35:00 its really pitiful how often i come to oil painting then i feel like dying for the entire class period and this is what i picked for my focus medium for some reason

4257 2018-02-12 15:30:50 You do not need a link. Inflation is more units of money used in the same number of transactions by definition. A change in oil prices does not change the units of money in the economy.

4281 2018-02-12 15:28:01 No raise, yet. :-( The oil and gas market is still very volatile and there aren't many projects floating around, so all the companies of my field have to be on money saving mode. It's frustrating, but we must understand their limitations too!
4282 2018-02-12 15:27:48 You made a good call initially on the direction of oil. But your emotion will blind you when things turn. And things can turn FAST in oil. Assuming you are a genius and everyone else is an idiot is a really dangerous outlook in trading. Don't let emotion cloud your judgment.

4374 2018-02-12 15:15:18 But let’s tax Canadian oil and not foreign oil.  Seems right.  How about this:  a 50% carbon tax on all foreign oil to offset the disadvantage that we have created for CDN oil and gas,  that is produced under stringent environmental and safety regulations with human rights.

4402 2018-02-12 15:11:55 Tea tree oil is more like a spot treatment. Do a test patch first for you to see if you need to dilute it or not. Lemon is too acidic for ones face. I recommend aloe Vera for dark marks and exfoliating more. It helps
4403 2018-02-12 15:11:55 England is not an island. It shares an island with two other countries - Wales and Scotland. However if you really feel that insular, we Scots will keep our Aberdeen Angus beef, scotch whisky, salmon, Arbroath smokies and oil, to ourselves. What Wales does is up to them.

Step 3: wait for corporations to back out 

Step 4: Blame the corporations and oil prices

4451 2018-02-12 15:05:16 Russian Sanctions is one thing. Releasing the GOP memo regardless of FBI warning and not releasing the Dem memo. Allowing oil drilling in waterways off of states that object. That’s a few. Russian sanctions not implemented is huge.

4455 2018-02-12 15:04:34 Why all the negative emotion? Seems you are extremely emotionally invested in your position, which is going to cause you to miss a lot of important info. Oil goes up, oil goes down. As for idiots, you do realize there are many people who are NOT trading on your timeframe, right?
4456 2018-02-12 15:04:31 CO2 is already used in "energized" fracturing fluids, so the technology is there. The difficulty is getting the CO2 to stay underground and not be produced back to the surface with the oil or gas, where it would have to be recaptured
4457 2018-02-12 15:04:29 Not so incredible: CCS has been pushed hardest by oil industry.
Who have the empty wells to put it in. And see the $$$ to be made.
Not to mention the full wells that captured CO2 can help them pump. 
"Petra Nova" = New Oil.

4471 2018-02-12 15:02:45 それだ！！！！！！！！！
4472 2018-02-12 15:02:41 LoL! No. Just think about currency. It’s a piece of paper that only has value cause government guarantees it. Without the guarantee, it’s Monopoly money. The USA strongest weapon is its currency. Crude oil is traded in dollars! No way we will give that up.
4473 2018-02-12 15:02:33 There's a small list of players on that team that I think would be worthy. Rust, Sheary, maybe Dominik Simon, Goalie Filip Gustavsson, Zach Ashton-Reese, Hagelin maybe, or Sprong. 

I imagine maybe 1 or possibly 2 of those players would be available.
4474 2018-02-12 15:02:22 I go for the roasted garlic. Whole head  wrapped in tinfoil w olive oil at 400 for 40 mins or so. Keeps well in the fridge if you just squeeze the cloves out of their pockets into a jar. Way more palatable - great to spread on sourdough!
4475 2018-02-12 15:02:04 The aircraft is undergoing an oil change today, but should be available to fly by the end of the day.
4476 2018-02-12 15:02:03 Yes that why I think PIT is not ideal.

4481 2018-02-12 15:01:41 I do. I wait a few minutes for the moisturizer to sink in. Sometimes, when not using a primer I mix argan or rose oil in with my foundation so it's lighter coverage, but still hella soothing.
4482 2018-02-12 15:01:38 @RachelNotley if you want you could refine your own oil and get a fair price for it.
4483 2018-02-12 15:01:32 Hi Ashely! Actually, there is! Using too much oil or fat while seasoning can leave a sticky residue on your pan. Thankfully, it is easy to fix!

4485 2018-02-12 15:01:15 I know what the oil and gas industry did to the town of Grand Junction Colorado and the once beautiful surrounding wild areas that look like industrial wastelands now. And my buddy is mud mixer who works all over the world.  The chemicals he puts in the ground water ARE toxic.

4504 2018-02-12 14:59:47 Did my report predicting higher oil prices cause oil prices to fall 10% in one week? Is this my first wrong prediction? Does anyone actually read my writing? No. The answer is no.

4508 2018-02-12 14:59:19 Oil prices have slid more than three per cent on Friday as US futures fell below $US60 a barrel for the first time since December on renewed concerns about rising crude supplies.   Yet our fuel prices are the highest since the Iraq war. Go figure @6PR

4537 2018-02-12 14:55:14 Exactly, that's the point isn't it. That's why natural remedies and prevention is the way to go. I wish I had known about Organic Coconut Oil benefiting the brain, sooner.

4560 2018-02-12 14:53:02 Bulls keep trying. All they're doing is giving more incentives for money managers to exit (at least the ones that haven't lost a ton already). I'm happy that the dumb dumbs who bought oil at 61+ only because of the dollar already lost money.
4561 2018-02-12 14:52:54 Money spent on republican wars for oil you twit, & that sad excuse for an infrastructure plan of yours is going nowhere. GREAT fall’s coming Humpty Trumpty!

4575 2018-02-12 14:51:31 This guys points are idiotic.  Electric cars will hurt tourism? 

But the US is not dependent on foreign oil.  Reducing harm to the environment will depend on what is powering all of those future charging stations. It’ll almost certainly be mostly natural gas.

4582 2018-02-12 14:50:04 Fish oil has been thought of as a wonder pill, with claims it protects against cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and promotes wellbeing. It is one of the most commonly consumed supplements. However, many consumers do not know why specifically they take fish oil pills.
4583 2018-02-12 14:49:39 Trump is apolitical, politics and issues don't interest him. He is selling and looking for people who are buying. Trump is an opportunist and snake oil salesman selling the next miracle cure. The art of the con and people are still buying.

4600 2018-02-12 14:47:44 Indeed. The BofE did not start inflation targeting until 1992. During the 70’s all the blame for inflation was down to labour costs and oil prices. No one listened to me then. Much the same now even though the logic off too much money is irrefutable.

4613 2018-02-12 14:45:51 @GovernorVA One more thing...since the state of Virginia is owned & operated by Dominion, THEY need to give the citizens a dividend for the priviledge of being the only electric grid in this state...just like the oil/gas companies do in Alaska..either that or BREAK THE MONOPLY..
4614 2018-02-12 14:45:51 Even more if we don't include NIS (oil industry) which was sold to Russians below market value.

4637 2018-02-12 14:42:50 On a lighter note, I'm loving the effect of sweet almond oil on my skin. Been using it for over a month already. I like it better than the royal jelly oil I tried before.
4638 2018-02-12 14:42:36 I don't live in the US. I live in Turks and Caicos but we import meat from the US. But the people seem to have a similar aversion to reducing their gravies enough so u can taste the seasoning and it's not just long water and oil

Also, not sure if you know about Essential oils, but i started putting the Thieves essential oil blend on my feet every day and it seemed to help my immune system for this weekend :)
4642 2018-02-12 14:42:11 Husbandpants found my oil paints. Gotta get back to that, eventually.
4643 2018-02-12 14:42:05 Excellent article...and so true.  

Digby Jones MUST KNOW he’s a snake oil merchant because of his own background.

That’s the worst of it.  Too weak to man up and say he made a mistake.  He’d rather the country suffered and dress it up, perversely, as patriotism & good business

4648 2018-02-12 14:41:43 I’ve started using the beard oil and balm. A couple days in, i can already feel it transforming my beard into black velvet. I can also speak to woodland creatures, and the Coming to America theme plays when I walk outside.

4658 2018-02-12 14:40:39 I don’t fall for the 5% that dictate the market for everyone else. Oil and stock are at sick levels. Oil should never be above $30 even. Market is 40% overvalued as a whole.
4659 2018-02-12 14:40:37 I'm really fucking mad because I spilled oil on my pants at work the other day and I've washed them two times yet the spots haven't come out fully so I guess I'm going to soak and scrub next
4660 2018-02-12 14:40:36 It’s so empowering to have someone show the reality of an illness you have and people go ‘that’s awful, I understand why you can’t xyz’ instead of ‘she’s faking it’ or ‘she needs more coconut oil in her diet’

Why you intentionally hurting PSU's?
Promoting Reliance,Essar for largees they put in your party funds? @dpradhanbjp
4668 2018-02-12 14:39:31 OK just for fun. May I ask are you contending that UKOG are currently filling up storage with dry oil at say 300bbls/day+ but have not told the market yet?
4669 2018-02-12 14:39:30 And what a mess they all were. Do you really believe the govt would have developed North Sea oil? The rest were jokes
4670 2018-02-12 14:39:25 People using Walmart brand Vaseline and off brand coconut oil on a 3 month old baby’s head. It’s a sickness, the stupid disease.

4672 2018-02-12 14:39:22 He still had 20B obama gave to his oil company in Brazil with US tax payers money.
4673 2018-02-12 14:39:21  guarantee you he went just for an oil change
4674 2018-02-12 14:39:09 JUST IN: Can oil continue its march higher or is another drop coming?  We'll ask famed trader Mark Fisher today on @HalftimeReport when he joins us exclusively
4675 2018-02-12 14:39:01 My bitter heart is pumping oil into my veins
4676 2018-02-12 14:38:57 I saw my uncle mixing some stuff and I was like Noice cause it looked like he was making drinks.
And then I realized he was putting garlic in an olive oil bottle... So I was like NOICE!!!!!

4679 2018-02-12 14:38:09 Hi salty, try with olive oil, minced garlic, and maple syrup.  Cheers
4680 2018-02-12 14:38:07 Smoke oil is used for sky writing.  It's time to look at the fuel supply and the companies that provide jet fuel. this is a worldwide phenomenon. It is time to look at where it is coming from.  Do we know?
4681 2018-02-12 14:38:00 I’m hoping the beard oil I got for my husband will be a jumping-off point to introduce basic skincare
4682 2018-02-12 14:37:53 WD40 is a pretty essential oil

4686 2018-02-12 14:37:43 But Eric don't discount how Canada can help we are the number 1 supplier of  OIL and NATURAL GAS to US. Let's make it a North American focus :)
4687 2018-02-12 14:37:42 Umm... wtf are you talking about? India used to buy from diversified suppliers decades ago. This isn't Modi anything - this is the way it has always been done. One pro-US supplier and one anti-US supplier (cf oil-4-food w Saddam)!
4688 2018-02-12 14:37:38 ただただ優しい人やったで。
4689 2018-02-12 14:37:32 I agree with Feyi it would have been a terrible idea. Abandonment is going to be a problem for some of those guys who acquired shell assets. People got high on $100 oil. European oil assets struggle in low price environment check Marathon and repsol
4690 2018-02-12 14:37:30 Yay. Venezuela.   Capitalism sees people as a resource to be exploited. A person's surplus value is as important to a capitalist than a material resource. Humanity are under paid slaves to the the capitalist machine. A resource to be exploited just as oil is.
4691 2018-02-12 14:37:15 After a coconut oil hair mask, mani/pedi, manuka honey face mask, and a scalding hot bath last night I am feeling better. Ready to kick this week's ass.

4718 2018-02-12 14:33:40 To date, 45Q has been much more a direct subsidy for oil and gas (mostly gas processing on the capture side, cheaper input for EOR on the oil side) than for coal. Remains to be seen if expanded credit will still be dominated by gas processing + EOR rather than post-combustion.

4747 2018-02-12 14:29:42 The oil industry gets tax breaks, while renewables get subsidies.

4753 2018-02-12 14:29:10 With that argument,it only makes sense to back places that produce less emissions overall.And that means backing our resources. 1 thing that is greatly overlooked is that tarsand synthetic oil is fully recyclable to its original viscoucity there is only one other reserve like it
4754 2018-02-12 14:29:05 Is it serum or oil?
4755 2018-02-12 14:29:04 Yeah Joey, The Republicans lied, started and supported Iraq invation including Trump. Then the top 1% and oil corps haven't paid enough taxes as they do in your example. Now Trump signed a $$$1.5 trillion tax break for himself & his cesspool + top 2%
4756 2018-02-12 14:29:00 i use pure coconut oil on my 3 month old , he scalp start breaking out real bad at like 2 weeks old so i started the coconut oil & havent had problems since .
4757 2018-02-12 14:28:56 Wow, Pete looks young what’s his beauty secret . I’m such a dog lover. Where do you get that oil and it’s okay for dogs to take and do they drink ?  And it helps with arthritis?
4758 2018-02-12 14:28:30 Getting an oil change at the dealership means that I have to sit in an office setting where multiple vehicles are parked. INDOORS! Very unsettling beginning to my week.

4763 2018-02-12 14:27:54 Palm biofuel will remove 17.6 t co2/ha/yr while soya or rapeseed only removes a tiny amount of co2/ha/yr so that it makes sense to reforest the land where they are grown to at least get a net of 3.74 t/ha/yr of co2 removal. Ban all except palm oil #biofuel.
4764 2018-02-12 14:27:53 i’ve finally tried maybelline’s superstay liquid lipstick and it really is That hard to remove. u cant use oil and cant be removed with my cleanser. it can be erased with a swipe of biphasic remover tho

4794 2018-02-12 14:24:54 Tim, U believe I am panicking because you have produced incorrect calculations? Far from it. I estimate the total amount of storage to be in excess to what you have calculated, I think that if we are flowing dry oil at the moment then very little space will be required for water.

4825 2018-02-12 14:21:32 I shall elaborate. First section obtains a non typo grammar error.
Second part is one of the most nonsensical statements Ive ever read. To simplify it for you. Its kind of how oil companies work. I've been noticing quite a few of these non structured tweets without point from you

4836 2018-02-12 14:20:45 I have long been convinced the primary reason behind pushing H2 is so the oil'igarchs can SELL it to us when the fossil fuels dwindle. Heaven forbid they drive on free, clean sunshine from their rooftops.

4854 2018-02-12 14:18:32 A world class product? relying on oil? I can't be bothered to argue with all that - so utterly stupid. Regardless mate, why don't you focus on your investments instead of fu?king off everyone else who has good money invested in Ukog?

4856 2018-02-12 14:18:26 Olive oil is the best. As a rule of thumb you should not put on your skin what you cannot eat while pregnant. The doctor’s suggestion to put cream with hyaluronic acid on skin may be a very bad idea since you may find out you are allergic to it at the worst possible moment.

5089 2018-02-12 14:01:14 They add so little flavor because of how they extract the oil etc. This makes a carbonated water that has some flavor without any sugar or calories. It’s a healthy option, and if you drink them enough you’ll get use to it and possibly like it.

5120 2018-02-12 13:57:33 The following is from their note - Between the 1st and the 12th month contract, the Brent futures curve still offers a roll yield of ~6%. Given that yields in other markets have risen, this has become less attractive which will likely have caused some outflows from oil.

5158 2018-02-12 13:53:38 On the contrary let’s hope for more rapid oil field depletion to drive EV transition, and then tax resulting oil profits to re-invest in low carbon tech (and offset impact on low income communities). We should have set a minimum oil price floor decades ago.

5189 2018-02-12 13:51:49 Please don't put lemon juice on your skin, it often causes serious dryness. As far as tea tree oil, I only hear of its anti bacterial and anti inflammatory properties (so great for acne!) so idk if it works. I think the key to dark marks is just sunscreen, exfoliation, & patience
5190 2018-02-12 13:51:41 Indeed, it is not only the public sector that is prone to producer capture. Many a large corporation can be run for the benefit of the senior employees. One large company I can think of is basically a pension fund with oil wells.

5198 2018-02-12 13:50:50 No it’s just the way my work runs is so stupid so a shit ton of burning oil fell on my hand
5199 2018-02-12 13:50:50 I wish y'all could see my face this morning, that black soap & coconut oil is a mufucka ...
5200 2018-02-12 13:50:45 Olive oil is way more expensive and valuable than olives. It’s more versatile and can be used in many different capacities but it has to be crushed and pressed first. The pressing is necessary for the greater output and usage.
5201 2018-02-12 13:50:34 Was naughty and bought some apple slices with toffee caramel dip from @BootsUK. Now I am pretty sure I have replaced my beard oil with caramel... still, it keeps it styled I suppose!
5202 2018-02-12 13:50:25 Next maintenance issue is the family car has > 200k miles and is leaking a lot of oil. It HAS to get replaced. Sigh.
5203 2018-02-12 13:50:06 Couple months ago, 5 minute oil fucked up my car causing the engine to over heat, they fixed the problem for free. A month or so later still having problems. Spend over $700 or getting my car fixed and everything’s fine. Two weeks later my car over heats again.

5206 2018-02-12 13:49:10 How bad are your spots/hyperpigmentation. Mine are mild (results of an occasional pimple) & I find tea tree effective (if you use oil, dilute it-can b v strong. I prefer tea tree face washes) also fresh aloe & vitamin e work well too.

5215 2018-02-12 13:47:47 As we all are foody we should also know more about the oil used for cooking food, let's talk about Mustard oil, improves digestion, good for heart health, rich in vitamin A and E, improves blood circulation and excretory system, prevent cancer and many more...

5250 2018-02-12 13:43:23 "There's only so much oil in the ground" is really a poor argument for the impossibility of a theoretical/actual gold standard. I'm really surprised it's still being used.

5339 2018-02-12 13:32:08 SO TRUE !!  I bought a tin of fish from China . When I opened it there was no liquid or oil inside to stop the fish rotting.  Thankfully I had the window open and could throw bit outside before the house stank.

5346 2018-02-12 13:30:38 Go ahead and buy oil you lunatics. Fucking morons still think oil will skyrocket to 70-80-100? Dumb fucks. How many #OOTTMoron s will lose hoping for 70-80-100 dollar WTI oil? The people that lose here deserve it. #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F

5349 2018-02-12 13:29:57 Re: claims risk-parity fund selling could not have played much of a role in recent sell-off b/c they’re not a significant % of total market. But haven’t we seen in countless other markets (eg oil) that imbalance of just a few % is enough, particularly if all doing the same thing?

5353 2018-02-12 13:29:31 @MariaBartiromo @dagenmcdowell Ladies, let’s not forget that automobiles and many oil using machines are much more efficient today which is contributing to less oil usage..
5354 2018-02-12 13:29:20 It's a great article. To me, this is about minimising mistakes right now. It's expensive though. That means the benefit accelerates with rising oil prices. @RTDukes

5381 2018-02-12 13:23:54 Will, your mistake here is that you’re trying to apply your decent values to people with no decency or values. What you (and I) deem abhorrent, people like Weiner consider a normal day.

5417 2018-02-12 13:17:58 Also disgusting is that: "a bill that would allow oil and gas companies to drill on minority mineral owners’ land without their consent." How is this even possible?? Without consent? Kudos to .@LlysseWylle for standing up to these grifters
5418 2018-02-12 13:17:54 Sadly, many of the assumptions that combine to give that figure are extremely poor (e.g. obviously incorrect assumptions on fraction of new palm oil on peat)
5419 2018-02-12 13:17:40 On a broader note, worth pointing out that global decarb of vehicle transportation (through mass EV deployment) necessarily undermines the economics of EOR (by cutting oil demand and prices) and thus many CCS applications. Tangled webs we weave.
5420 2018-02-12 13:17:14 Wondering if krill oil is really that affective,is it affective or effective?Either way it’s defective!I’ve been out of it for a week now,there’s a lot of rumbling going on in my body,I get sick every Sunday night into Monday,and I’m crapping out my ass nonstop.

5450 2018-02-12 13:13:16 Nah but it’s oil they’ve earned over the years. They make their own oil.
5451 2018-02-12 13:13:11 Yup pwede ra sya. For face “detox” iya main purpose. Para sa mga acne, discolorations etc. Apply lang ka ug Shea Butter or Jojoba Oil sa imo face after. Pero depende ha if kauyon ka sa Oils. 
5452 2018-02-12 13:13:04 Come on now oil money F.C. don’t get ahead of yourselves.  You’ve had a great season but one good season doesn’t make you special. Still can’t fill your stadium playing probably the best ever football the league has ever seen. Bad.
5453 2018-02-12 13:12:58 The US is selling oil to the Middle East today, in Trump's second year. I just think there are real differences in Trump's results on infrastructure already that you're overlooking to make a hypothetical argument
5454 2018-02-12 13:12:56 That is a big deal to Irag, in terms of strategic egress of oil.  Would be a big carrot, beyond what Iran can offer.  The straight, considering current US FP, is a dangerous strategic path to market, making access to that pipe HUGE.

5459 2018-02-12 13:12:24 "Put it this way" a few guys I work with will say it before they have made a previous point that needs to be explained more. Example; "Put it this way we should have changed the oil in the car a week ago." As the first sentence of a conversation.
5460 2018-02-12 13:12:23 Agreed.  SV has yet to finish a race this season at temps below 65ºF w/o gasket failure.  Keep that oil sponsorship, fix the engine issue, win big next season, more sponsors will come knocking!

5488 2018-02-12 13:07:31 I disagree that Venezuela went too far on Socialism. Granted, I'm a musician who reads a bunch and not an economist or historian but I think their problems stem from basing their whole economy on oil exports. Or it could be a combination of things.

5514 2018-02-12 13:03:18 Classic example is Wintershall. It and its tech suppliers are so enmeshed in global oil and gas supply chains that it is very difficult for anyone apart from a few Italian, US and Japanese competitors to break in to many of these niche markets. Locks in Germany's export advantage
5515 2018-02-12 13:02:48 It will be paid for with Iraqi oil. Just like Cheney, Bush and Rumsfield said with the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars. 
5516 2018-02-12 13:02:43 The consumer spending element must affect #diesel demand, not just in gross tonnage carried by #trucks but also #fuel demand associated w/end-use delivery of online purchases that has exponentially increased since 2000 & even since 2008 financial crises event. #oil #energy

5518 2018-02-12 13:02:30 Everyone uses the roads. Goods shipped go to every oerson in the US. Gas taxes unfairly affect the lower income folks. Older cars get worse mileage. Tax energy at the source, oil, wind , solar. Put the $$$'s to infrastructure.@dagenmcdowell

I was thinking more, like: bath bomb or lavender oil?
5531 2018-02-12 12:59:49 Frackers don't run oil through a faucet with an on/off dial. It's not like a one month px surge incited them to turn on the faucet to Max for a month. The oil was coming anyway. When will the MSM and Twitter sphere understand this false dynamic they constantly promote.
5532 2018-02-12 12:59:35 I cleanse tone and moisturize.... daily even when i travel.. it's my facial routine..  at night a use a night cream and a light dab of coconut oil.. makes my skin feel soft and smooth #MondayMadness  .. @MBPIETERSE
5533 2018-02-12 12:59:20 The USA imports 8 million barrels of oil per day... and then we burn it.
5534 2018-02-12 12:58:56 Which one is correct?   
The price of oil is very (?).

5535 2018-02-12 12:58:47 Monday looks to start the week on a positive note. US stock futures are up 1.2% with Europe higher and Asia mixed. Oil is $60.11 with gold at $1,321. Hello Monday! 

I have a school hall meeting in Van Buren this afternoon. I look forward to speaking with members there.
5536 2018-02-12 12:58:22 We dont need their oil.  Lets just leave them alone.  We can send them postcards.  Stop foreign spending.  Go Trump.
5537 2018-02-12 12:58:20 North Sea oil is owned by UK. No get paid (in financial help) by UK to extract oil. Norway actually makes money from the same resource.
And as you raised oil, what countries are worse off for having oil other than Scotland?

5539 2018-02-12 12:58:04 How many more promises wil Trump break to his loyal idiotic base before they realize they were sold some snake oil? I'm guessing there's no number.
5540 2018-02-12 12:57:54 And what did your seven trillion dollar investment get you all these years? Increased military expenditure, greater flexing of the American strong arm tactics in the Middle East, cheaper oil, more young lives lost in vain!
5541 2018-02-12 12:57:34 as with oil...I always assume what ever they say....they are doing the opposite
5542 2018-02-12 12:57:32 Coal and Oil are obsolete.

5544 2018-02-12 12:56:57 I use it for multiple reasons. It helps slick my hair/edges down when needed. I use it in my hair for wash and goes. If I'm doing twist outs i can put it on with my moisturizer so my curls will hold more. With the black castor oil one I really didn't need anything with it.
5545 2018-02-12 12:56:45 There’s no such thing as beautiful solar panel made from OIL that have a lifespan and eventually end up in a landfill and don’t work when it isn’t sunny or wind farms that don’t work great when they aren’t near a city or windy
5546 2018-02-12 12:56:35 I have always wondered about this. I saw shops selling CBD oil and was like nah that can’t be real.
5547 2018-02-12 12:56:31 The muzak at the dealership where I’m getting my car’s oil changed is a hybrid mix of jazz and heavy metal. Not quite nap-worthy, but almost appropriate for head-bobbing, which itself might lead to incidental snoring.
5548 2018-02-12 12:55:51 Butter/ghee/oil in coffee is just fine. i just hate men.
5549 2018-02-12 12:55:50 Let's not get carried away by figures

1998-2003 era was different

Crude oil was still $20-30
Typewriter was still in use
Mobile used to be Voice only
Artificial Intelligence was unknown

Outsourcing IT services picking up steam

As said
Past is a good place to visit only
5550 2018-02-12 12:55:39 Blaming Saddam Hussein for "September 11" World Trade Center attacks was pretext for Bush to destabilize Middle East. Afghanistan has been ongoing "oozing sore" with BIG PAYOFFS, in another juicy "currency"! Everyone knows that OIL and DRUGS "make the world go 'round"!

it works for me when i have really dry skin on my face 
5597 2018-02-12 12:49:49 Sure, but if you look at an economy that was reliant on selling $80 per barrel oil, growing Asian demand to sell that in, and also to buy political influence through commodity I'd say that's quite a loss .. how did you vote?

5638 2018-02-12 12:42:46 Hi Jemima, palm oil is one of the highest yielding vegetable oils, therefore, replacing it with other oils may actually cause larger, environmental and social problems. Some other oils also lack strong standards for sustainable production, unlike palm oil which can be grown 1/3

5741 2018-02-12 12:29:56 The latest surge in U.S. oil output will probably hasten the country's rise to the top of the producer pile.  ... It's starting to look as though at least half of OPEC's nightmare scenario for 2018 -- a surge in shale output and slowdown in demand growth -- is coming true.

-Use Dishwasher (25%/75%water) solution and immerse affected area in solution, letting it sit or spray continuously
5752 2018-02-12 12:28:56 President Trump is wrong if he thinks his base will go along with another war. 

Israel wants to topple Syria, they want their land & oil. Do not make the mistake by getting involved.

5767 2018-02-12 12:26:45 No, the biggest risk is oil falling below $60 bbl.
Did you see the Siemens interview on Bloomberg this am, where he said the lights were back on after recovery in oil price?
5768 2018-02-12 12:26:15 Best. Yes before cleanser biasa. Tp kalau tak makeup, guna cleansing oil, then rinse with water pon dah cukup. Sebab once the oil kena air dia akan dissolve and dah tak dlm oil form dah.

5780 2018-02-12 12:24:18 Perhaps Israel making war, with Iran, and Syria (Russia), is helping oil, but the broader market doesn't care.   Oil was already having a technical bounce, so... Up 1% in pre-market.

5786 2018-02-12 12:23:50 Mostly EOR is used in depleted conventional fields to push more oil out. Not used for fracking. Possible it can be in future (in lieu of water) but I don't believe that technique is mature yet. 

Only about 4% of US oil as of 2015 DOE report comes from EOR. Could easily double.

5852 2018-02-12 12:11:04 Oil doesn’t come from dinosaurs. It is created deep within the earth and is constantly being replenished.  Everyone needs to stop listening to comedians and actors when it comes to serious topics.
5853 2018-02-12 12:10:53 Now that’s unfair.

They also like crude oil.
5854 2018-02-12 12:10:39 It's because OPEC is trying to con the market. Amazing anyone in the market takes what they say seriously. But now, even they can't con their way to the fact the world is swimming (and has been swimming all this time) in oil. #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F

5875 2018-02-12 12:06:41 The price of oil varies wildly and the fact that it needs to be phased out entirely over the next 40 to 50 years (with the most expensive sources eliminated first) seems like bigger concerns then regulatory uncertainty.

5924 2018-02-12 11:59:58 Oil was also a factor - inflation is a rolling 12 month calculation, so where prices were a year ago just as important as today. 

12 mths to end April 2017 Oil rose from $38 - $56 (c50% increase) but last 12 mths it’s up from $58 - $70 (c20% increase) so up,  but by not as much.

5983 2018-02-12 11:49:02 I fully agree with you that oils are bad for us; coconut oil is even more harmful than butter due to even higher saturated fat.  I actually work at a public health service- We use the Total/HDL cholesterol ratio (which factors in LDL- Hardly irrelevant).

5985 2018-02-12 11:48:14 No offshore drilling. There is plenty of oil already.
5986 2018-02-12 11:48:14 yes, and that's the last thing they're gonna to get for some time. Some increases result from too low deductions, to be reclaimed at the end of the tax year. Some, e.g. in the solar industry (bigger than coal & oil together) are hit hard, by the new tariff w/ 1000s jobs at risk!

5991 2018-02-12 11:46:54 Yes it does matter where, a country using a heavier crude or coal only domestically isnt building export infrastructure for it. It isnt building it into its trade strategy. It isnt helping other nations break emissions targets. It isnt driving cleaner oil price down.

6004 2018-02-12 11:45:20 Bloomberg News notes a fascinating aspect of the coming U.S. oil boom: it is partly driven by measures OPEC put in place to deal with falling oil prices, which were driven down by a previous surge in American production and the resulting “oil glut.”

6025 2018-02-12 11:42:59 U.S. oil production is expected this year to surpass Saudi Arabia’s output, upending a global pecking order that has been a basis for U.S.-Middle Eastern policy for decades.

6155 2018-02-12 11:23:39 Yeah @LattybooHarris, leadership.

Trinidad saw that 20 years ago. Heavy reliance on oil meant their economy crashed when the price of oil fell. 
They decided then to build and nurture their manufacturing and financial sectors. 20 years on, look at what they've done.

6174 2018-02-12 11:20:14 Saudi Arabia is a feudal system. If your country has problems new oil wealth accentuates them. After 1980s oil price drop liberal Venezuela became a victim of neoliberal globalist institutions. This created the conditions for socialism which the oil price rise then accentuated.

6217 2018-02-12 11:11:04 It's very simple. You sauté the mollejas (sweetbread) in a bit of olive oil. Then add minced garlic and parsley, crushed almonds (using a mortar) and a bit of flour. Stir it all. Add white wine and a tad of saffron if you like it.
Then let it cook for 45 minutes. Eat while warm!

6422 2018-02-12 10:22:43 Only 4% of global oil production is used for plastics - and there are biological alternatives. Regardless of that, we still need transition for all those out of a job and those who will be out of a job in the future.
6423 2018-02-12 10:22:23 my leg still hurts and all i can think of is that oil we used to have that would help so much with this
6424 2018-02-12 10:22:16 Only 4% of global oil production is used for plastics - and there are biological alternatives. Doesn't change the fact that oil and gas use is killing us and we need to get off it.

6574 2018-02-12 09:48:54 Same tactic used in Iraq. Turn the people against each other, propagandise with chemical and weapons of mass distruction and cause an uprising. They did this in Basra, then Haliburton took their oil. Dick Cheney on Genie board was one of the major players. Wake up to reality pal.

6624 2018-02-12 09:39:27 Africans are often short changed because we just want to clinch the deal no matter what the cost is. We must scrutinise & do our due dillingence ensuring that it makes sense for us now & in the future. Walk away if it doesn't.I think of Chad & that oil pipeline!

6630 2018-02-12 09:37:39 When someone replies ‘Interesting’ to something you state- it often carries the implication of at least 10-30% negative to me. Lol! Doesn’t mean that I’m offended - Imma chef, tell me if my salad had too much salt and not enough oil, etc. It’s cool!

7257 2018-02-12 07:41:44 i almost just dropped $80 on a shale rock MacBook case from an IG ad like I was at the checkout with my mf card but I still haven’t changed my oil because it costs like $40
7258 2018-02-12 07:41:28 Charles...not all oil is the same and in fact canada oil sands is crap oil. Not easy refining and needs a heavy mix of light sweet crude to dilute and CAN does not have proper refining capabilities. Tax on gas though is a problem.

7272 2018-02-12 07:39:39 Same accusations fly about anti wind campaigners. The industry and its supporters cannot believe we do what we do because we believe it to be right. Apparently we are all paid by Big Oil! Pre White Paper preferably!

7286 2018-02-12 07:35:32 Honestly, as bass ackwards as most conservatives are, they will mostly likely go out and buy shares in Oil & plastic companies out of spite.
7287 2018-02-12 07:35:10 Dick Cheney: “The good Lord didn’t see fit to put oil and gas only where there are democratically-elected regimes friendly to the US . Occasionally we have to operate in places where, all  things considered, one would not normally choose to go. But, we go where  the business is.”

7324 2018-02-12 07:27:53 Why are US troops in Syria? Before, we were fighting the enemies of Assad, mainly ISIS. I can not think of a legitimate reason to oppose Assad and Russia in Syria, unless the goal is for Israel to expand and access oil in the disputed Golan Heights. I'd love to hear your reasons

7331 2018-02-12 07:26:10 It does actually... But I guess it's because I don't use it everyday, plus I treat immediately after and I don't let my hair dry out, nikona coconut or jojoba oil and also drinking water is an underated thing but it helps with hair and skin
7332 2018-02-12 07:26:06 Last time we paid $1.50 a liter, oil was trading at $150 a barrel. Today oil is at $50 plus change. How much tax has gone in since & how do we have no $ for infrastructure after all this excessive gouging? #bcpoli #vanpoli @christyclarkbc @jjhorgan

7343 2018-02-12 07:23:51 Ok. So two years ago is a tad different that since 2015 and it changes the context a bit, no? And saying that he "tried" to trade RNH leaves us the impression that he failed to and he's stuck with him. Not true. 

That said, Hall was not his first choice to move out...
7344 2018-02-12 07:23:48 I use this one lotion from big w!! Its called emu oil and it works so well for me. Its thick, but it isnt too greasy! Its in my bag ( but im in the toilet atm ajdhsj) so i’ll send u a photo when im done HAHAHA

7350 2018-02-12 07:23:13 I’ve been fighting dry skin for years, ever since I left JA. Last November I started taking 1 1/2 tablespoon of Olive oil at night. What a difference it has made. #dryskinsolution #oliveoil #fromtheinsideout #water #missthehumidity
7351 2018-02-12 07:23:08 You can fix your skin, especially scarring, rather than feeling you have to hide it under makeup. Using nutritious plant oils (even on oily skin) with high vit. E content will clear up scarring. Cleanse with an oil, use oil instead of moisturiser or before your moisturiser.

7412 2018-02-12 07:11:24 Another note I'll say to this whole thing, is maroon will probably end up in STL or Boston.  Peter has been trying to trade for spooner since he got here.  Maroon is going to end up in STL anyways both sides seem to like each other on that front.

7421 2018-02-12 07:09:07 A few flaws with Preston Manning’s comments; how about putting a stop altogether of the trillions of dollars in subsidies toward oil and gas exploration?  And how difficult is the concept of taxing the polluter & rewarding the clean options? This is what governments are for!
7422 2018-02-12 07:08:43 Nobody is saying they aren't shopping for a defenseman. If this were a competition I think you'd have a point. I'm absolutely ok with being wrong.
7423 2018-02-12 07:08:29 We really do need to be more vocal about this narrative that the "political wonk/consultant" industry is often as influential as more stereotypically evil and involved industries like the oil industry, despite their methods being different.
7424 2018-02-12 07:08:25 zero fat doesn't mean it is good I actually like the fatty ones especially if you are using real cream & eggs & olive oil brilliant we need more dietary fats especially saturated fat most of the illnesses are down to low fat high carb diets they are not good

7427 2018-02-12 07:08:14 China going to make a big deal with Saudi Arabia.  Chinese want oil supply guaranteed...  think Saudi Arabia more likely interested in supporting that than USA.  Over time Oil cheaper and Gold higher.  The Kissingeresque oil gold link will break.  Oil going US$20 a barrel.
7428 2018-02-12 07:08:10 it wasn't dirty, that's the point. i fill up the sink with hot water and soap so that when things soak, oil won't cling to them and make them harder to clean.
7429 2018-02-12 07:07:50 Noam Chomsky's coauthored "Western Terrorism" shows true America when she sees oil, tenders and selling arms. Matches with beast like lamb but speaks like a dragon, Rev 13:11. Oil in Turkana and Raila's "I'll remove our troops from Somalia and fight corruption" hurts America.

7492 2018-02-12 06:57:39 They could use an upgrade that 3rd line winger too. Maroon has playoff experience and loves playing against Boston’s play style. Yes, they need a RHD but as we know with Larsson, they’re gonna have a hard time finding one.
7493 2018-02-12 06:57:33 We expect the JSE to open (+0.5%) firmer today on account of stronger Asian equity markets in overnight trade. However, we expect the prices of energy shares to be negatively impacted by the drop in crude oil prices below US$60/ barrel.

7512 2018-02-12 06:55:19 Godec is shallow until Kenyans know America hates democracy and people who'll hinder their satanic appetite for oil, tenders and selling arms. Oil in Turkana and Raila's "I'll remove our troops from Somalia and fight corruption" is reason America hates him.
7513 2018-02-12 06:55:17 Singh. Extractive minerals & oil are the most expensive, high demand  items that determine the actual wealth of a country.

7526 2018-02-12 06:52:40 That's nice.  Ill have to go listen, but my bet is he probably said oilers have taken calls from teams like Tampa. Then mention maroon.  Tampa is calling teams right now looking for a top dmen. Not a winger so I don't care what the hell Friedman says.
7527 2018-02-12 06:52:32 Have we forgotten the oil in Turkana? Western envoys will do everything to ensure we fight to get the opportunity to exploit our resource unhindered. See African countries with the same resource.

7537 2018-02-12 06:51:47 Most of the prospects were Keith Gretzky’s picks. I’m pretty sure he knows the Bruins prospects a lot. TBY is a division rival so he’d probably know more about opposition depth too when projecting the team depth.
7538 2018-02-12 06:50:48 My partner has just heard a giraffe with its foot stuck in an oil drum.

7543 2018-02-12 06:50:00 I suppose anyone claiming innocence of accusation is presumed guilty simply by virtue of asserting innocence. Irrational, illogical
7544 2018-02-12 06:49:52 Trump's mind is shot when he takes National Park land and lets Oil and Gas buy it for drilling and mining. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE
7545 2018-02-12 06:49:37 Ever since global oil prices jumped, albeit briefly, on news of a coup in Niger in early 2010, I stopped taking these “insignificant” details lightly. I mean, who would think flunking elementary geography would cause a global oil rally 
7546 2018-02-12 06:49:05 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
7547 2018-02-12 06:49:02 I don't think Tampa is interesting at all in Maroon.  Hey called about klefbom. That's it.
7548 2018-02-12 06:48:40 I LOVE the dry body oil 
7549 2018-02-12 06:48:34 Well even if he wants to stay, he can always come back this summer. So why not get something for him

7553 2018-02-12 06:46:47 I haven’t been to work for almost a week and my skin is looking better. Maybe it’s all that damn oil and grease
7554 2018-02-12 06:46:39 I don't shampoo my hair .. condition and treatment only. Then I apply gel and use jojoba oil/ coconut to keep it soft.

7560 2018-02-12 06:44:39 No dood, the environmental expense is too great. Just lose reliance on oil, that's where the momentum was. Help the environment and get off oil. How come Florida got exempted from off shore drilling? Why don't we off shore in Florida and leave the rest of the coasts alone?
7561 2018-02-12 06:44:38 @BeerLeagueHeroe you seem to have done your homework on the players you think should come back. I wouldn’t be surprised if you have spent more time on this than the #oilers management
7562 2018-02-12 06:44:25 Can i exclude the essential oil

7566 2018-02-12 06:43:46 He could at least have the decency to have the oil companies and the chemical companies pick up the tab. We know who @EPAScottPruitt really works for. Sure isn’t the American people.
7567 2018-02-12 06:43:14 olive oil 晴れの午後に聴くのが1番いい。映像も好き。
7568 2018-02-12 06:42:31 Excellent time for ScotGov to move on IndyRef2
Could b considered, us Scots helping WM. They won’t have to worry about keepin us together when we’ve gone. EVIL will not need as much attention cause oor 59MPs won’t b around
Eng will have a prob with no oil but - ha ho that’s life
7569 2018-02-12 06:42:18 I hope one day we all agree that hosting the Olympics and the World Cup sucks for cities and force them to compete on an Oil Derrick in international waters like some fucked up Metal Gear spin-off.
7570 2018-02-12 06:42:15 Lol - keep trying to sell it Gilles. The only people buying your snake oil are those you tell what to think by telling them to think for themselves, but only to trust what you tell them to think...

7572 2018-02-12 06:42:00  at least tell us that if it was kfc that you put the chicken in a 400° oven for 10-15 minutes ... Much crispier crust and like a quarter cup of oil sweats out

I cooked a Chicken Carbonarra with sour cream/green onion mashed taters and garlic &herb steamed cauliflower 
7573 2018-02-12 06:41:50 pakek moist nder. Pakek in face oil. Kalo punya haple deh. Kalo gak ada, ya olive oil bisa. Yg buat muka loh. Hhe

Love cannot endure indifference. It needs to be wanted. Like a lamp, it needs to be fed out of the oil of another's heart, or its flame burns low.
7582 2018-02-12 06:39:57 thinking of Bio Oil, hm does it work?
7583 2018-02-12 06:39:51 As soon as the incisions are closed completely, start using Mederma Advanced twice daily every day. My surgery was two years ago and I have zero visible scars at all! The bio oil is just a scam-don't fall for it.
7584 2018-02-12 06:39:51 .@ThisIs_Progress will there be any more of the White Eagle t-shirts coming in stock? I seem to have got an oil stain on mine and wanted to get a replacement!
7585 2018-02-12 06:39:46 You do realize the first sign of racism is the person who keeps repeating, “I’m not racist” right?
7586 2018-02-12 06:39:40 No number and seal ? How about the oil and gas sector do govt got any plan to compensate them?
7587 2018-02-12 06:39:28 @elonmusk so.. I’ve been using castor oil and my hairline is growing in… How did you get your hair back?

7590 2018-02-12 06:38:36 All war is murder

The western governments profit from the murder through arms sales and cheap oil 

We are passed one sugary benefits, through material goods, and the hook of their 24 hour cultural agenda.

We occasionally protest, and then drive home and tune in again.
7591 2018-02-12 06:38:32 Sorry to say it, but you & your fellow deplorables don't even realise when you are being manipulated. You are the market for snake oil.
7592 2018-02-12 06:38:30 in the studio with no drank an no footballs !! Mad at the oil man right now all these good vibes in the air an this bitch ass tree ain’t gone do it !

7594 2018-02-12 06:38:22 They? Do you even know who the majority of recipients on welfare are? Do some research. When the drug testing for welfare checks occurred, those who were tested and found positive were white. Do some research and educate yourself.
7595 2018-02-12 06:38:08 I think I just burned my skin with tee tree oil & I am truly terrified of what to expect in the morning
7596 2018-02-12 06:37:56 Good morning my brother. Lets not go back to "Egypt" Bayelsa,  a major oil producing state has just 8 LGA s and the least House Reps Members. Is Kano with the lots doing better than Bayelsa is caring for the citizens? Let's forget the old thinking and build a new Nig.

7612 2018-02-12 06:35:39 It's important to specify _what sort_ of oil painting someone is, at the very least.

7624 2018-02-12 06:34:53 if you want really want to change things you could build your mars power grids all over new mexico so its not running off coal an oil. It would change everything people know about power. An it would be a perfect chance to test the full extent of your technology @elonmusk @TIME
7625 2018-02-12 06:34:13 Thry have no right to move in and then demand I support them in any way anymore than if I came home and found someone living in my house.
7626 2018-02-12 06:34:12 Yeah it is too bad. I didnt see how much his absence would hurt us...but It's obvious now. I think some people had an idea, i was sure we could get by but that was one of our biggest losses imo

Fact is the herd is bearish oil and to say the Saudis have a huge incentive to get oil price up is the understatement of the decade imo
7645 2018-02-12 06:30:21 @NTAGMN Now that Nigeria has come out of recession and other sectors of the economy, other than oil, are gathering strengths, govt should focus on promoting long-term sustainable growth. Hopefully, current ERGP will help to secure a stable and more prosperous future.

7654 2018-02-12 06:28:19 Why tax the solar powered industry so much when it employs more people than coal and oil put together, a 30% tax on solar powered panels is gonna mean 260k job loss, waaaaay too much winning climate denying failed business man.

3,000,000 x 365 x $100 x 15

7676 2018-02-12 06:25:11 Agree but I would like to see Talbot move the puck more. I said before he doesnt need to be Smith, but I would like to see him play it at least once in awhile.
7677 2018-02-12 06:25:10 Yeah, I watch our dmen these days and I have to say that they could use defenders are have real puck skills.

7739 2018-02-12 06:14:39 I don't know much about aviation machines but they carry a lot of fuel. Normally it's about impossible for it to explode. It's basically just mineral oil and has to be atomized to even ignite.

7747 2018-02-12 06:13:10 I would like to know if the fwds have s'thing to do with the defense not being able to move the puck fast enough. Meaning are they simply not giving the dmen the options by going too fast/slow or are the dmen simply not skilled enough to make the pass?

7753 2018-02-12 06:11:40 I think the biggest issue this team has had far and away has been special teams. Talbot second and third is defence first passes out of the zone.

7761 2018-02-12 06:11:15 We do differ there. I don't believe the Oilers NEED a top-5 goalie to succeed. It'd be nice but not required. I'm not saying any goalie will do either.

7770 2018-02-12 06:09:48 All three are very different players, but I view Cernak around the same level as Jones and Bear. He is a an absolute tank, who's surprisingly mobile. I think he'll be a solid NHL'er in the mold of a Josh Manson one day.
7771 2018-02-12 06:09:40 I'm kinda busy being lazy. Anyone got any takes on the new Chinese Yuan oil futures market?
7772 2018-02-12 06:09:31 Yes. And the Beeswax products are amazing. There's the actual oil I use.  But there's also a creamy lotion I use which is a bit more user friendly than the oil

7776 2018-02-12 06:09:13 Never said the rest won't but don't think the team is good enough. Where we differ, is I believe they need Talbot to be a Top 5 goalie for this current group to be a contender.

7792 2018-02-12 06:06:23 I think he absolutely could return to a top five goalie. He’s got size and is reasonably athletic. Positioning and confidence need to come back. He also has been absolutely victimized by piss poor defensive schemes that led to a lot of goals being back door tap ins.

7795 2018-02-12 06:05:42 AH thank you! I knew s'thing was up with Lipanov. I'll go change that up now. 

Why Cernak? is he better than the Dmen the Oilers have coming up in the pipeline?
7796 2018-02-12 06:05:40 With that said, imo, Talbot being on his knees has nothing to do with it.

7800 2018-02-12 06:04:49 I don't think anybody is saying Talbot is a top-5 goalie here. The conversation is about Talbot's tendencies to get into the butterfly and whether he's making the right choices or not. 

Not only that but why do u have no doubt he'll bounce back but the rest of the team won't?
7801 2018-02-12 06:04:47 He hasnt been good,, has zero confidence and the team infront of him sucks. Not a gokd combo. Compare that to last season, when he was all world & everything broke Oilers way & the slip in the standings isn't that farfetched.
7802 2018-02-12 06:04:25 From Tampa I'd be targeting Erik Cernak or Mitch Stephens. 

Also one note. Lipanov is no longer with the Colts, he was dealt to Sudbury at the CHL trade deadline.

7813 2018-02-12 06:02:52 When the puck isn’t behind the net or along the boards I don’t like seeing a goalie down in the butterfly ever.
7814 2018-02-12 06:02:48 My oil diffuser is the boost!
7815 2018-02-12 06:02:38 Well there you have it.

Water is the new oil.
7816 2018-02-12 06:02:33 Latino military survival kit: coconut oil, Vick’s vapor rub, chancla, adobo, 5-55 cord, duck tape.
7817 2018-02-12 06:02:30 just got tea tree oil in my eye, stay tuned for more relatable self-blinding updates
7818 2018-02-12 06:02:25 아   잉 철수야 넘 예뻐요^--^^^^
7819 2018-02-12 06:02:08 I think everyone needs to accept Talbot isn't a Top 5 goalie & hasn't had a great year. With that said, have no doubt he'll bounce back next season but the team infront of him has to improve.
7820 2018-02-12 06:02:05 I tried putting coconut oil on my face tonight , if I wake up with acne I’m suing Hawaii
7821 2018-02-12 06:01:50 She’s running for office against one of those guys. They were voting on a bill that would allow oil companies to drill on people’s land without permission
7822 2018-02-12 06:01:43 But, compared to British Petroleum’s efforts to plug its deep-sea oil hole, the G-20 leaders look omnipotent.
7823 2018-02-12 06:01:38 things might need to be fixed but you never have to do it right away. You have to stick your ground &say NO IM JUST HERE FOR AN OIL CHANGE
7824 2018-02-12 06:01:36 Poetry;

Is the song that played every time I walked in the grocery isle,

Is the popping of hot oil when I fried that piece of chicken,

Is the sigh I let out every time I arrived home from work.

7826 2018-02-12 06:01:04 It sucks that the only thing you can do about gum on hair is to either cut the hair or use copious amounts of olive oil to slowly remove it.
7827 2018-02-12 06:00:59 I do m8 but she doesn’t load up on the oil like old mate

7829 2018-02-12 06:00:35 Thats not at all the point anyone was making. Im not following you Rob. Do you think he's as good this year? Is it just confidence? Whats your take?
7830 2018-02-12 06:00:35 #hitchoil today at 2.30pm. Anyone needs oil replenishments?
7831 2018-02-12 06:00:29 Can rise 2 d challenge if tasked with specific time frame. Sesame seeds / Sesame oil export our baby, nurtured 4 10 long years.
7832 2018-02-12 06:00:28 One more person who tells me to lose weight or that Im obese, is going to see me drink a bottle of oil, just to let them know that it is #mychoice. #bodyshaming is the most uncool thing. Im tired of you all.
7833 2018-02-12 06:00:22 np Miro! Thx for reading!
7834 2018-02-12 06:00:18 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.

7840 2018-02-12 05:59:31 can the oil companies stop digging up all this oil and just use the one from my damn face
7841 2018-02-12 05:59:15 Game of thrones and needing sleep is like trying to mix oil and water to one solution... 
7842 2018-02-12 05:59:11 And that was the case when everyone loved him last season.
7843 2018-02-12 05:59:07 keto can be a helpful tool. just like everything else you choose to do for yourself, I suggest to do your research. keto is high maintenance for me: paying extra close attention (more than just my fitness pal) to track macros, mct oil, keto urine strips, blood keto test etc etc.
7844 2018-02-12 05:58:57 The one getting wasted on olive oil
7845 2018-02-12 05:58:50 They will get more for patty than a 3 rd rounder. Thanks for sharing / prospects.
7846 2018-02-12 05:58:35 The question is not whether he plays butterfly it is when and how.
7847 2018-02-12 05:58:21 Two main reasons why Nigeria exists?
1. British colonialism
2. Oil

Everything else is "patriotic" nonsense.
7848 2018-02-12 05:58:20 say that you use cooking oil with pepper
7849 2018-02-12 05:58:04 the GOP have got nothing left, they sold their souls, their integrity, their values, their morals etc when they got behind Trump he's a snake oil salesman and they knew it, they wanted a win that badly...still no impeachment so they're not going to do anything, waiting on Mueller
7850 2018-02-12 05:57:43 I want one with bottles of Pink Oil Moisturizer and Pump it Up.
7851 2018-02-12 05:57:43 Which is fine but did you take issue w/ it in either of the previous two seasons?
7852 2018-02-12 05:57:11 @Ameryl_oil 트친소에 알티해주셔서 선팔하려고 합니다 u//u 잘부탁드려요
7853 2018-02-12 05:57:05 And we're back at the knees.
7854 2018-02-12 05:56:40 Once upon a time as a boy of 17 yrs, I would pause on a small bridge near my home, listen to the hum of ships, smell the oil and the harbor, look heavenward and say, softly, "Thank you, God, for allowing me to be here, at this time, in this place."

It was my only prayer.
7855 2018-02-12 05:56:33 Congrats to tonight's #NHLGreatestTeam 50/50 winner who's taking home $31,747.50 with ticket 115229C! Thank you for supporting the #Oilers Community Foundation & @SportCentral_AB!

7859 2018-02-12 05:56:19 I stopped using moisturizer and started using Vitamin E oil instead and it’s been life changing. 

1. My skin is never dry anymore.
2. What is redness? 
3. I am GLOWING
7860 2018-02-12 05:55:33 I’ve used Heavy Hitter carts before but I’ve never tried their “cold filtered” line. The oil is really clear & clean. I got 3 of the cold filtered ones (Tangie, Strawberry Cough & Malibu OG) & 3 carts of their regular ones (Blue Dream, Skywalker OG & Pink Kush).
7861 2018-02-12 05:55:17 Full Oil n gas boom and a great economy before 2026! It could happen again, maybe AIMCO will pitch in...
7862 2018-02-12 05:55:11 There's one indispensable element in leap frogging Africa from its present economic quagmire. It's NATIONALIZATION OF ALL AFRICAN RESOURCES leading to African OWNERSHIP of all African EXTRACTIVE MINERALS & OIL WEALTH. International trade, as it is now, creates poverty in Africa.
7863 2018-02-12 05:55:01 Sippin on that fuckin motor oil
7864 2018-02-12 05:54:30 No question when he's not feeling it he's retreats deeper into his net but he's always on his knees.

7871 2018-02-12 05:52:10 Try using coconut oil.  Big lots have unrefined coconut oil for $5.  I use it all the time
7872 2018-02-12 05:52:03 They don't even have full blown medical. There's 10 things you can get cbd oil for. CBD!! That shit isn't even for getting a buzz. Old ass representatives aren't about to change the status quo. Too much money in court fees, suspended licenses, and probation. Cash cow. Moo
7873 2018-02-12 05:52:01 For sure it’s every bit mental as it is positioning. I think at the beginning of the year he was deep in his net due to confidence
7874 2018-02-12 05:52:01 I got a great deal today from King of Vapes diespensary. Their first time deal is: buy 2 grams of cannabis oil carts & get 1 gram free. Then you get 25% off your total which added to the free cart makes it 50% off. So I got 6 Heavy Hitter carts. I love stocking up.
7875 2018-02-12 05:51:51 We too feel it's time to act East. Sesame seed a product of East with huge export reach as Sesame oil can make it work 4 nation  if given backup support and of course if given  d product too.  Always keen to keep eastern flag aloft.
7876 2018-02-12 05:51:47 Ah. Must filled with Canadian Oil workers then!
7877 2018-02-12 05:51:45 Agree on this for sure. I think anyone who watched last year knows Talbot has the skills
7878 2018-02-12 05:51:30 @KTRTRS Sir,Request you to please don't encourage Oil palm tree cultivation in Telangana. It's such a curse to environment. The industry is linked to major issues such as deforestation, habitat degradation, climate change etc.
7879 2018-02-12 05:51:29 Who's defending, I said it was an ugly goal.
7880 2018-02-12 05:51:29 What is my dad like?  Yesterday he came home w a box of Avacado oil bcuz his friend had extra & my dad asked if he could have it. Last week he came home with 2 huge bags of oranges bcuz he asked our neighbors to let him pick them from their tree. HEB who?

7885 2018-02-12 05:50:15 I mixed bio oil with my face moisturizer AND LET ME TELL YOU!!! Amazing
7886 2018-02-12 05:50:09 You can't cover all of it my man...
7887 2018-02-12 05:50:08 I disagree on that one. It was a terrible flop to the knees on that and he didnt even have the position to cover the net. I dont think he's solely to blame, but dont defend him on that goal. He needed to be better...good goalies make important saves. He needs to find that again.
7888 2018-02-12 05:50:05 Don't you just hate trying to get oil paint off your hands ugh #paintingstruggles
7889 2018-02-12 05:49:37 I agree tea tree oil helps improve boils.

7893 2018-02-12 05:49:08 Question.

So, does luke function with oil like the tin man?
7894 2018-02-12 05:49:04 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
7895 2018-02-12 05:49:03 Also let's not kid ourselves, Talbot's confidence has been in the toilet for much of the year and that plays into a goalies mojo on the ice...no different than any other player.
7896 2018-02-12 05:48:46 Covers the bottom of the net but makes the top harder to cover.
7897 2018-02-12 05:48:33 "—coal, oil and gas. In this viewpoint, we have argued that the technology already exists to deliver a completely decarbonized, energy-rich and sustainable civilization, via the extensive deployment of next-generation nuclear power systems and associated equipment..." /3

7904 2018-02-12 05:47:11 Propaganda from fox news. MS13 members R mostly in prison. Economy is showing signs of a recession, the rich get a trillion dollars & you get a dollar fifty. Trump just cost Solar industry millions of revenue and over 30,000 jobs. So we can export oil and natural gas from RUSSIA.

7908 2018-02-12 05:46:31 You could tell he couldn't find the puck and was looking for it. As he went down, the lane opened & puck flew by him. Ugly goal to be sure but when most of these guys can't find the puck they drop to their knees. Covers more of the net.
7909 2018-02-12 05:46:15 You may have to. I don't. Hannan is a snake oil salesman..You bought some .

7924 2018-02-12 05:44:23 I may even get my nails done tomorrow I gotta get an oil change first.
7925 2018-02-12 05:44:16 Have not trusted Goldman since they pounded the table on $200 oil years ago.  They've fairly consistently been wrong about everything since.
7926 2018-02-12 05:44:05 1. Payment on all the times I made her cum.

2. Payment for all the times she squirted on my mattress.

3. Payment for all the times I got stained when she was leaking oil. I didn't mind, now it bothers me.
7927 2018-02-12 05:43:59 I honestly love be smell of Abeni’s tea tree oil, it calms me down so much
7928 2018-02-12 05:43:59 fitz is going on cbd oil next week to help with his anxiety & i will be so grateful if it works 
7929 2018-02-12 05:43:55 I never use coconut oil first of all because it stinks and secondly because it'll clog TF outta your pores

7931 2018-02-12 05:43:47 Because someone Zinke puts in charge of stealing oil from BLM or Indian Reservation lands will know exactly what to do at a wildlife refuge....
7932 2018-02-12 05:43:33 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
7933 2018-02-12 05:42:50 As there is w/ all these guys. My point is must of them go down early but the majority of fans by little attention until pucks start going in.
7934 2018-02-12 05:42:49 Different fluids (oil, hydraulic, lavs, etc.) can leak on bleed air ducts and spread fumes.  Not entirely uncommon.
7935 2018-02-12 05:42:45 you should probably contact her. i use olive oil and avocado oil. 
7936 2018-02-12 05:42:40 Been seeing more oil tanks moving on rail in the last two months.
7937 2018-02-12 05:42:14 Keep talking Catherine, everyday something more and more ridiculous comes out of your mouth. I'm still reeling from your comment that oil patch workers are harmful to towns
7938 2018-02-12 05:41:48 Just remembered that @Dommaaaaa17 got me for tea tree oil. Smh it be ya own niggas.
7939 2018-02-12 05:41:33 I can see the oil , and is that poo with dieria ?
7940 2018-02-12 05:41:13 aquafina makes a lip oil that is literally a life saver
7941 2018-02-12 05:41:04 Yep.
7942 2018-02-12 05:40:52 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
7943 2018-02-12 05:40:42 And this is the offering that you shall take from them: gold, silver, and copper, blue, purple, and crimson wool; linen and goat hair; ram skins dyed red, tachash skins, and acacia wood, oil for lighting, spices for the anointing oil and for the incense... #parsha
7944 2018-02-12 05:40:34 Are you talking about the goal against LA?
7945 2018-02-12 05:40:30 .... OKAY I don't use coconut oil on my face that's for my body scrub
7946 2018-02-12 05:40:26 the guy in the net in TB has been dominating the crease since he was 16 years old. There's a bit more to his game that going down early.
7947 2018-02-12 05:40:22 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
7948 2018-02-12 05:40:21 I should own stock in skin lotion companies! What do fellow #Spoonies #MCTD #Lupus #AutoimmuneDisease Do about your "crepe paper" skin?? Ive tried so many things. Coconut oil & quality brand body lotion. Doesn't really show improvement.
7949 2018-02-12 05:40:19 The oil of Non-Abrahamic countries must be used in Non-Abrahamic countries first . Supplying oil to India is Iran's responsibility first . It is also a religious responsibility .
7950 2018-02-12 05:40:13 I like the episode but it just came so out of left field. hey I can revert you from cyberman to oil but I could make you human also I can pilot the tardis
7951 2018-02-12 05:40:11 The Oil boys are no better or worse than any others. It's all a smear job to once again screw over any type of energy project. I worked in that industry, and there was a bit more fighting and carrying on, sure, but no more disrespect to women than you would find anywhere else.
7952 2018-02-12 05:40:11 ブレーキランプ5回点滅、ごま油のサイン。
7953 2018-02-12 05:40:03 the Koch Bros empire started with their father with oil money he earned in the Soviet Union.  They want the oil drilling, the EPA to relax or end rules on the environment, they own paper products companies, Georgia Pacific, oil and chemical interests.  They are Traitors to USA
7954 2018-02-12 05:39:40 In the middle of the ice?
7955 2018-02-12 05:39:31 Why not ban “all”. Why just transport of “new drilling”. Ban all transport of oil in CA.  They don’t need any, right?
7956 2018-02-12 05:39:18 I fixed my car, broke a nail, have motor oil stained hands and I’m still going to workout...What’s your excuse? 
7957 2018-02-12 05:39:10 O.o uh I say Forrest, oil, uh can't say and wolves?
7958 2018-02-12 05:38:58 They cover far more net in the butterfly & give the shooters fewer options, especially w/ how large goalies are today. Talbot is playing the same style he did last year. Going down early is the norm. The guy in TB is going to win the Vezina & is always on his knees early.
7959 2018-02-12 05:38:58 Olive oil mayonnaise 
Honey mustard
Huancayina
Kalamata tapenade

8056 2018-02-12 05:20:22 What I'm trying to understand is why  dont we increase the capacity but then retain the oil here and refine it for local consumption instead of bringing it in from the states?  The reason I am paying $1.40 a litre is because of a disruption of production in The states.

8076 2018-02-12 05:17:24 Why doesn't the United States get oil discounts or royalties for drilling on public land? The United States government shouldn't give free oil to anyone except to the public who owns that land. Even pipelines should pay fees for using public or private land.

8306 2018-02-12 04:37:30 Yes, "collectivised" by the USA, Kurdish militias and their ISIS allies, removing then from the control of the legitimate sovereign government.

Always the same with the USA; secure the oil wealth, pay off mafia militias, and ensure the host nation is brought to its knees.
8307 2018-02-12 04:37:28 True fact. We have a lot of olive trees around here. The sidewalks are stained in olive oil from the fallen fruits. Some day we'll think to harvest and brine some.

8342 2018-02-12 04:31:58 interesting that its apparently "okay" for a white man to shoot and kill an indigenous man because he was "protecting his land", but for some reason when indigenous people try to protect their land from toxic oil pipelines its NOT okay to protect your land.

8481 2018-02-12 04:13:16 Why is petrol in Brunei cheaper than in Msia?
Brunei population: 420,000
Brunei oil production: 110,000 barrels/day

Msian pop: 31mil
Msian oil production: 660,000 barrels/day.

Msia has 73 times more people but only 6 times the oil. Much more mouths to feed & hospitals to build.

8534 2018-02-12 04:07:14 Oil comes comes from 100 million years ago+, AND it comes from plankton and algaes, not dinosaurs. No, no new oil has been appreciably made since millions of years before dinosaurs even evolved.
8535 2018-02-12 04:07:09 Now the same is done with gold nano rods, nano shells etc & this can lead to excessinve heating recall oil grows from bacteria
8536 2018-02-12 04:06:52 Perhaps, not many appreciate the false moral equivalency, double speak, and snake oil.

8540 2018-02-12 04:06:40 We all know that the Trump Administration is all for the oil industry and Pence is a hands on guy.
8541 2018-02-12 04:06:29 Also I spilled sesame oil all over myself and the kitchen and the smell makes me want to gag but I haven’t changed my clothes or washed my hands. #psychologicalywoke
8542 2018-02-12 04:06:25 I already regret scheduling my oil change and tune-up for 8am tomorrow.
8543 2018-02-12 04:05:58 yeah significant others are nice but have you ever had nail polish with rose oil IN IT SO YOUR NAILS SMELL GOOD ALL THE TIME
8544 2018-02-12 04:05:58 It's harder to hide a rail spill and lie about the quantity spilled than it is to hide a pipeline spill and lie about the amount spilled from a pipe. That's another reason oil companies prefer pipelines.
8545 2018-02-12 04:05:49 まれによくある。
8546 2018-02-12 04:05:07 I just sauté them with a tiny bit of olive oil. Honestly, I think my love of real pasta ruins all substitutes. They don’t compare!
8547 2018-02-12 04:04:58 I got my electricity bill today so now I’m living off of oil lamps and Jesus candles

8551 2018-02-12 04:04:40 In China the air is poisen because of their heavy use of coal and oil that is why they are going green because they will die and be very sick If they don't. It is life and death.

8553 2018-02-12 04:04:23 Thanks Sister, We are with you. That Pest Control agency needs to be created as a matter of urgency. As for the oil sales, Hmmn...We are in it together. Hopefully, when truly we have our true #Change after 2019 & #Togodebout & #Fauremustgo happens we shall see.
8554 2018-02-12 04:04:22 Try magnesium oil tis fantastic natural product
8555 2018-02-12 04:04:08 And the big containers of olive oil. Oh man. I used to want to be on this when I was a kid lol.
8556 2018-02-12 04:03:38 whenever i decided lotion was a lie was when i decided im just using straight oils/butters all around. i have one curl product, one cetaphil for winter/hospital hand sanitizer ash, & a big ass jug of coconut oil. that’s it for my whole body lmao

8562 2018-02-12 04:02:46 I believe the technical term is “snake oil.”
8563 2018-02-12 04:02:45 Amateur tip: if it looks like there might be too much oil in the pan for frying, there probably is. #overflow #fireonthesmoothstovetop

We cause more problems by our meddling in foreign affairs to super the oil companies.

Typical American jingoism.
8571 2018-02-12 04:01:51 Did you know the ships like the USS Arizona (bombed in Pearl Harbour) are still leaking oil? Crazy I know :D
8572 2018-02-12 04:01:49 So out of it this morning I drizzled sesame oil instead of honey on my oatmeal :\

8580 2018-02-12 04:00:53 Fiat currency is a commodity that gets worth from demand. Citizens demand $US because it is the only way to pay taxes. Other demand is due to it presently is the only currency in which oil is traded. Keeping demand is why we war in the ME. But China is taking that rolled over.

8586 2018-02-12 03:59:50 Because your @POTUS would rather coal and oil ... he sees no good reason to reduce pollution like the rest of the world ...
8587 2018-02-12 03:59:40 Was just washing my hair and Jill Scott, Alicia Keys, and Chaka Khan came on back to back. Never felt more like a black queen as I used my Cantu Conditioner and coconut oil!
8588 2018-02-12 03:59:30 well you can't just say that and walk away pick up that pipin' hot oil drum of Takes and dump it on us
8589 2018-02-12 03:59:25 I forget conservative Canadians who believe oil and coal are our future exist, and it’s frightening.

8593 2018-02-12 03:59:05 I like mixing clove with peppermint because the clove oil provides heat & was historically used for toothache pain. It's a natural numbing agent.
8594 2018-02-12 03:58:57 Actually oil on oil bgs tau...sbb dia lg kua kan those dirts n impurities. Lps skin dah clear then use serum utk tighten your pores n brighten up ur skin.

8596 2018-02-12 03:58:05 First thing first, find the right cleanser. Lps tu how to prevent breakouts n rawat pimples. Serum use once ur face dah ok dr pimples. And moisturiser kna use daily. Some says, jgn use any oil based to oily skin kn?
8597 2018-02-12 03:58:01 Most corrupt state in America. Fun fact: if you live within so many miles of an oil plant and they contaminate your drinking water, they’re not legally required to tell you! Yayyyyyyy
8598 2018-02-12 03:57:38 Nothing to do with oil. The reliance on oil is down. The oilfields in the US have een opened up all except the emergency reserves.
8599 2018-02-12 03:57:32 Talk to me about CBD oil. Did you see benefits? Reputable brands?
8600 2018-02-12 03:57:29 My hair don’t even care that I just spent $8 on this high ass Jamaican castor oil shit.
8601 2018-02-12 03:57:28 I remember someone wanted to commission me for an oil painting of a landscape for $80 and I ended up backing out and I was like “why did I do that” and then I was like “oh right cause I would have charged like $300 for that fuck”
8602 2018-02-12 03:57:19 I tried a peppermint oil massage this morning. It didn't really do much. But I smell better.
8603 2018-02-12 03:57:02 And , we all know who is in office to protect Exxon Mobile, as well as his oil investments in Russia...The one and only Rex Tillerson...Out and out American Traitor!!!
8604 2018-02-12 03:56:52 Or not Kate, actually there are alternatives to oil & during the downturn AB (& BC!) could have totally invested in those alternatives & better prepared us for the inevitable future. Sadly we didn’t so here we fighting over the last scraps  #FromTheInbox #StopKM
8605 2018-02-12 03:56:43 Old fans/electric motors have a distinct smell to them. That’s probably what my fursona smells like. Either that or oil and grease... xD

8607 2018-02-12 03:56:25 Add hot oil in a pan with a bit of onions  and the noodles and let that sauté for about 2-3 minutes then add tomato sauce and water with salt pepper and whatever else you want then bring it to a boil or until the noodles are soft!
8608 2018-02-12 03:56:23 I’ve heard put a drop of essential oil in it
8609 2018-02-12 03:56:15 Not in NFld.  Bunch of rogues robbing the poor.  Why carbon tax is never mentioned.  NLers won't see a refund as Trudeau claims.  This on top of Muskrat hydro triple rates while drilling oil.  They're all nuts #nlpoli #cdnpoli

8613 2018-02-12 03:55:25 I'm sorry to hear that. NSAIDS have saved me multiple times. I'm allergic to Tylenol. Have you tried essential oils as a topical? Clove & peppermint oil mixed into coconut or almond oil is a soothing mix.

8616 2018-02-12 03:54:19 Maybe just as simple as oil. Putin / Russia have nothing but oil.  Kill the EPA,climate science and alternative energy and kill the sanctions . Oil is power and money.

8618 2018-02-12 03:53:35 Tea tree and coconut oil. Put it on right after you shower and it helps it grow and look fuller.
8619 2018-02-12 03:53:25 Sugar and toxins cause heart disease and that's all you have to know. Types of fats have very little to do with the equation... Eat freaking lard if you want to.. actually too much is made of the coconut oil fad... Most of your diet should be monounsaturated
8620 2018-02-12 03:53:20 Aw dang! Well, best of luck to y'all. You still have friends here in Austin. Don't forget to change the oil.
8621 2018-02-12 03:53:18 A struggling family bought a cheap ranch and lived on it for ten years before discovering that it was rich in valuable oil.  As of this year, they have millions of dollars.

8622 2018-02-12 03:52:51 flying sheep..no wonder you couldn't sleep  .... maybe try a hot bath in with camomile oil or a complimentary relaxing oil that'll help you switch off mentally & then have some Camomile tea & scented candles ... works for me when l'm buzzing & need to sleep ..

8626 2018-02-12 03:51:40 Tomorrow she goes out to get an oil change and transmission flush done, and I'm hoping that takes care of some lingering issues, and if all's said and good, then that should be the last bit of maintenance the car's been really behind on!
8627 2018-02-12 03:51:30 Bought few shares of AkzoIndia today. Q3 results were decent. Cheapest paint stock on basis of valuations. Plus crude oil prices have also fallen recently..so margin pressure should reduce.

8631 2018-02-12 03:50:47 the tar sand oil can NOT be cleaned up when spilled!!! that is also difference it isn't LNG or even refined oil which I would maybe swallow  but bitumen can not be cleaned up properly
8632 2018-02-12 03:50:45 Truth. Other than his mother Mary, the other woman who was always at his side was Mary Magdalene. She was with him until the end. Clensed his feet with expensive oil, saw his crucifixion and his ascension to the sky. Jesus respected and cherished women.
8633 2018-02-12 03:50:40 Coconut oil
8634 2018-02-12 03:50:26 It's magical thinking to believe that making oil production cheaper somewhere means it's going to 100% displace oil produced elsewhere - I don't understand this assumption at all. Not how markets function. Cheaper supply can induce demand.

8637 2018-02-12 03:50:02 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
8638 2018-02-12 03:49:39 If you have massive job losses due to a downturn in oil prices which leads to record unemployment-you’re not diversified. One commodity taking down the economy is not diversified.  We are more diversified than the 80s but barely.

8646 2018-02-12 03:48:17 How? The digging of a new, probably dirtier well is avoided and most of that CO2 pumped underground will stay. Pretending we can avoid oil being dug up in the immediate near term isn't helpful.

8649 2018-02-12 03:47:27 While in boot camp back in ‘96,I heard from two generals that 25% of Europe’s oil on average comes from Russia,and the closer the country, the higher the dependency. This greatly affects the country’s foreign policy options,effectively forcing a deal to be made in Russia’s favor.
8650 2018-02-12 03:47:21 Wait did I invent broccoli stem pizza? I can't find anything on it online, I made it bc the stalks on kids broccoli were so thick.

8663 2018-02-12 03:45:01 ok but nothing grinds my gears more than when a white mom has a biracial kid and doesn't treat their hair. Like coconut oil is not going to harm them jessica, it's better than their hair looking like crisp leaves.

8671 2018-02-12 03:43:21 wearing that foundation for about 7 hours I can say it sets well but oil will peek thru if you're a combo skin person like me.
8672 2018-02-12 03:43:20 1/ 1 small onion + 2 serranos, chopped, in 1-2 tbsp of neutral oil.  1 lb beets, peeled, cut into 1/4" thick batons.  1 tsp salt, 3/4 tsp sugar, 3/4 tbsp rice vinegar, 3/4 cup coconut milk, 1/4 cup water. 8 curry leaves.
8673 2018-02-12 03:43:16 It's gear oil. What you'd put in a manual transmission or a differential.
8674 2018-02-12 03:43:09 A better analysis of Venezuela's problems resembles "resource curse" policy far more closely than "socialism". Chavez was, in the end, just another charismatic dictator standing on an oil well. The leftism or rightism is a canard.

8681 2018-02-12 03:42:38 Your original campaign promises of carbon taxes and adjusting the royalty rates scared off international oil companies and investors. Now you want B.C. to save you from the mess YOU created?

Your snake oil is dangerous. Your cult following of you and your products is disgusting. 
I am VERY HAPPY that David will no longer be speaking at the expos, and that sponsors are pulling their funding.

8692 2018-02-12 03:40:32 Don’t let them put the baby oil on them! This happens to me too & that’s what worked. If you think about it, they’re opening all those pores where the hair used to be & then putting oil right over it

8697 2018-02-12 03:39:28 Kurds invaded Arabic lands.2 million Kurds invaded %30 of Syria. This is not fair obviously. Imperialist western powers are supporting for oil and gas. Also they are still crusaders sadly. Turkish army is ending this project. Arabs are also rising up for their honour.
8698 2018-02-12 03:39:12 1/2 Just ate a granny apple, about 30 minutes after my only meal of the day, which consisted of a giant mixed green organic salad, garlic, avocado, olive oil, cucumbers, onion, yellow peppers, sardines, and sunchokes, and a bowl of almonds, walnuts, cashews, and pumpkin seeds.

James 5:14-15
8702 2018-02-12 03:38:04 And keep in mind almost all CO2 under 45Q to date has been used for CO2-EOR, effectively a subsidy that incentivizes additional oil production. Very possible net emissions *increase* with CO2-EOR via 45Q.

8706 2018-02-12 03:36:56 Just read about Gold injections, that Gold is prescribed to reduce joint inflammation . . . .  If only there wasn't a cheaper/better/smarter alternative like CBD Oil or any other form of Medical Cannabis out there, with less/zero side affects

8708 2018-02-12 03:36:35 Imperialists are trying to invade the region for the control of oil and gas resources. Kurds are being used by them.2 million Kurds invaded %30 of Syria. Is this logical? Turkish army is ending this project side by side by Arabs.

8719 2018-02-12 03:34:45 If you need help to eliminate your own use of oil and gas, let me know. I have solutions. Till then you can quit criticizing others. Easy to complain when you don’t have a solution or an alternative. Maybe just mind your own business.
8720 2018-02-12 03:34:20 Traditional Canadian maple syrup is worth give or take $1800 per barrel vs $66 for oil... so hear me out let’s pull out of the Middle East and head north.
8721 2018-02-12 03:34:15 Look into cleansing oils instead- they hydrate with irritating and do a pretty good job at removing makeup. I swear by Boscia's Make Up Break Up, but trader Joe's actually sells a really great facial cleansing oil too!! If not, jojoba oil makes a great all natural makeup remover
8722 2018-02-12 03:33:42 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.

8727 2018-02-12 03:33:04 I’m so excited to go buy tea tree oil tomorrow to fix this flare up. I refuse to look like teenaged jasmine
8728 2018-02-12 03:32:46 I was the same way until my friend gave me California poppy oil mixed with ginger oil, truly changed my life for menstrual pain
8729 2018-02-12 03:32:23 One serious drawback of planes that old though were 2-stroke engines lubed by castor oil.  In WW1 they'd cut a trapdoor under the pilot so he could shit in enemy trenches ;)
8730 2018-02-12 03:32:20 I just got back into my routine of using the Thayers Witch Hazel after each wash. Currently moisturizing with a combination of mango butter, grape seed and rosehip oil.
8731 2018-02-12 03:31:46 I've been making curries for well over a decade. I've been making my own ad hoc curry powders for a couple of years. 

But I've always used oil to cook them.

Tonight, Jon joked that I should use ghee because I was using a dairy pan.

I happened to have butter in in house.
8732 2018-02-12 03:31:36 Omg yes. Homemade meatballs, I used jar sauce but I put onions, peppers and mushrooms in alittle olive oil and cook them and put them in. Boil sausage and cut that into the sauce. Oh my lol
8733 2018-02-12 03:31:28 En diciembre de 2016, la firma China Offshore Oil Corporation ganó dos áreas #petroleras durante la Ronda 1.4, donde se licitaron 8 bloques en aguas profundas en el Golfo de México.
8734 2018-02-12 03:31:22 Don’t worry. The power plants that supply electricity in LA are burning natural gas, and on occasion, diesel. And the ships that deliver the lithium from South America to China and back to the USA as batteries burn lots of diesel. Big oil still feels the love.
8735 2018-02-12 03:31:15 Oh and angels on bare skin as a daily cleaner. Marigold oil in it targets scars. Ground almonds for exfoliation. $15 worth will easily last 2-3 months. Exfoliation and moisturizing will help!

8742 2018-02-12 03:29:48 I hate coconut oil
8743 2018-02-12 03:29:47 Actually you’re wrong. Sorry to say , you have no facts. You enjoy the benefits of an oil based economy and wish to deny others the same benefits. Shame on you. Quit using oil!  If you can get off oil, then you can talk.
8744 2018-02-12 03:29:45 Try peppermint oil. I got mine from @mugziesnaturals Works perfectly.

The marinade is:
½ c. Sugar
½ c. White vinegar
¼ c. Oil (not olive)
½ tsp. Salt
1 tsp. Celery seed
Pepper, to taste.
 
I usually add a little bit of Dijon to the marinade too, so it doesn’t separate as easily.  Try to make it at least the night before.
8750 2018-02-12 03:28:48 If you still have the soap, try and dilute it and see. If not there are tea tree oil soaps from Trader Joe's that are really good. You can get them on amazon.

Have you ever wondered why there are no #trading setups of #US #Oil posted? 
It's because this is a commentary blog not trading service. What is more important is knowing whether or not a trend is complete. This is the ultimate art of trading.

8760 2018-02-12 03:27:35 That would work really great together. It's a light/sweet oil and it doesn't clog. Just two- three drops. A little goes a long way. It'll do you good.

8762 2018-02-12 03:27:12 From the articles I have read about this, the problem is that the production of CBD oil doesn't seem to be regulated and all sorts of things are being added. Kids are having serious reactions to the unknown additives. They have also mentioned synthetic CBD as a factor.
8763 2018-02-12 03:27:11 Is EOR/EGR broadly suitable (when the CO2 is subsidized) for injection in all types of shale oil/gas fracking wells? I know they don’t all need it, but would it help, at least marginally?

8766 2018-02-12 03:27:01 I pour aloe Vera juice and my As I Am leave in conditioner into a bottle and spray my hair with it every other day and it keeps my hair really soft. Don’t have to add anything else really to my hair now. You can add a oil too
8767 2018-02-12 03:26:16 I got into a car accident today. 
After visiting my old church. 
Ironic enough the sermon was about suffering and realizing that we experience joy because we know of suffering. I know I was supposed to visit my old pastor today as they anointed him with oil for a health concern.
8768 2018-02-12 03:26:14 Don’t show this to @LukeGromen he’d figure out a way to add a few fancy surplus/deficit/reserve/Gold->Oil words to it and call it BULLISH when it’s exactly the opposite - biggest explosion will be EM

8808 2018-02-12 03:20:39 Canada currently has 41,855kms of oil pipelines active and functional in Canada....government is treating KM line like a first of it's kind...bottom line, Liberals can't stand Alberta being proactive for the economy of Canada.....this won't change unless government is changed.
8809 2018-02-12 03:19:58 We had two atomic bombs which we weren't sure would work, and not until 1945. The Sovs tore up hundreds of thousands of Nazi troops and equipment, and helped keep them from getting vital oil fields that would have likely cemented their hold on Western Europe.

8815 2018-02-12 03:19:15 Yet we forget the sanctions imposed on NK recently. That 90% of their oil is cut off and rely on it to fuel their energy source. Unlike the US who has nuclear power in most states to provide electricity. Funny how NK was going to do the same thing until Bill Clinton screwed them.
8816 2018-02-12 03:19:02 You can also find several recipes to make your own with egg, avocado oil, etc.
8817 2018-02-12 03:19:02 Ask them to check the oil while they're at it. (Be safe.)

8820 2018-02-12 03:17:51 Do you even know where we get our oil?
8821 2018-02-12 03:17:17 Imma worry bout my oil change tho boi
8822 2018-02-12 03:16:58 yeah almost exclusively.  If you use a little oil/butter and get the pan hot enough before you put them in they won't stick once the pan is seasoned.  I like the taste better too but that might be in my head
8823 2018-02-12 03:16:57 can i request your team to focus on oil and gas topics only?

8836 2018-02-12 03:15:27 1/ Part of the problem with the snake oil that David Stephan peddles, is that he is using studies done by a Calgary researched (Bonnie Kaplan) to try to validate his product. People are so uneducated, that they see "Dr" and "Study" and just assume it is legitimate.
8837 2018-02-12 03:15:25 Take Scott Pruitt (please!) Maybe this is too easy.
Head of the EPA. He’s a climate change denier. He sued the EPA 13 times. Employees of the EPA protested him as Secretary. He’s received over $300,000 from the oil and gas industry! So no possibility of being bought off here.

8843 2018-02-12 03:14:26 What's more, pumping oil through it would make it easier to destroy, due to the fact that oil is highly flammable. Puncturing, containing then igniting would create a hole big enough to travel through totally defeating the point of both.
8844 2018-02-12 03:14:16 The country is relying on oil.
Which is also making it go down.
But hey, you won't listen to anything but whatever comes out of the media.

8850 2018-02-12 03:13:41 Hopefully it’s not ear mites!
You could try a drop or two of mineral oil and massage it in a bit, see if it gives him any relief. It sometimes helps to loosen up dirt and wax in the ear. Olive oil can be used if you don’t have mineral oil.

8853 2018-02-12 03:13:30 Oil es agente de retención, no sujeto del impuesto, por ende esto no sólo es evasión sino una situación prevista en la ley penal tributaria.

8855 2018-02-12 03:13:28 I remeber them saying they wouldn’t take out some oil trucks bc of the environmental impact-that’s how they were fighting war-by protecting environment first.

You can’t prosecute war, when the main goal is NOT winning.

8861 2018-02-12 03:12:40 Now why can't you use a 1 ft diameter pipe for a pipeline? Because once you add in all the leak detection and multiple layers, as required law you'll end up with a 2 inch pipe. There's no practical application of that in relation to oil. At all.

8974 2018-02-12 02:56:19 Trump is not a Republican nor a conservative. He is an opportunist and snake oil salesman. Trump knows that people are always looking for the next miracle cure. He is always selling the next con and people are always buying it.

9001 2018-02-12 02:50:44 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
9002 2018-02-12 02:50:35 The vinegar increases shine, and aloe adds softness, and both help condition dry scalp and fight dandruff. It'll leave your hair smelling a bit like salad dressing, though, but the essential oil helps with that. (Also, tea tree & peppermint help with dandruff & scalp irritation)

9017 2018-02-12 02:49:12 And you know Fortune, what really upsets me is that nobody talks about how pepsico, the mother company that manufactures the crappy and full of yellow #5 doritos buys unsustainable palm oil. That is actually worse than they coming up with a woman's snack... #boycottpepsico

9027 2018-02-12 02:47:42 It helps to understand why some people are so frightened and angry at Trudeau.

9036 2018-02-12 02:46:17 Haha one of my most uncool opinions in trading down in a loaded draft is actually a good idea, and the Oil got bit by the luck of the draft. They take Mike Richards there and everything is different...

9103 2018-02-12 02:35:11 Tax revenue makes government the biggest beneficiary of "Big Tobacco." Government is also the biggest beneficiary to "Big Oil" taxes as well.  #Lackeys

9108 2018-02-12 02:34:15 The main cause of acne is thought to be a rise in androgen levels (type of hormone). Rising androgen levels cause the oil glands under the skin to grow. The enlarged gland produces more sebum. Excessive sebum can break down cellular walls in the pores, causing bacteria to grow.
9109 2018-02-12 02:34:14 Lana does the mustard seed have any oil value? Being a southern fellow we don't grow what you guys grow
9110 2018-02-12 02:34:11 Its not working.Everyone knows she is anti oil and is a liar. #abpoli #ableg #CarbonTaxStealing
9111 2018-02-12 02:34:10 I prefer linseed oil and beeswax, it brings out the grain.
9112 2018-02-12 02:33:56 Hmm .. well lets see ... 
Lets make a T-Shirt
Manu in ON too expensive due to our Green Energy Hydro.
China opens a plant powered by coal. Then make the T-shirt and ship them back to us on a oil freighter.
Libs go hooray .. we are saving the environment.   NOPE.
9113 2018-02-12 02:33:54 RT @MattMakesMeSick: Extreme couponers be hype as shit on IG cause they got 60 quarts of motor oil and 85 ketchups for $7 <— It’s so addicting.
9114 2018-02-12 02:33:36 Hold on sis while I got your attention lol. When u say a “ mineral capitalized by black people” are u referencing oil or gold? Cuz u kinda lost me a little.
9115 2018-02-12 02:33:17 I’m obsessed w essential oils! Lavender oil on my temples on, on my pillow, &  in the the diffuser before bed, peppermint oil in the shower before work and eucalyptus when I’m congested. Dis my shit
9116 2018-02-12 02:33:05 It really was x_x ugh tbh the castor oil is still effecting me and it's not fun at this point. Unless you have an incredible... constitution, this is a bit more than i was asking for lol
9117 2018-02-12 02:31:57 Tree oil is so good for your hair but smells really relaxing also
9118 2018-02-12 02:31:51 Me too bro that was pretty Bad for longs I see $62's soon they will be alright. #Traderbrother we all need each other.
9119 2018-02-12 02:31:42 I’m glad you liked them! Autumn was nervous! It was her first time making them with coconut oil instead of butter (due to my super lactose intolerance)
9120 2018-02-12 02:31:32 So after all the " special oil" the sewing machine companies told me to buy I tried something I know. The foot to my machine wasn't going up and down, completely jammed. WD40 fixed it. Screw the other crap they made me buy, this fixed it instantly!
9121 2018-02-12 02:31:28 మీరు ఆలివ్ నూనెతో రొట్టెలు కాల్చవచ్చు|Can you bake with olive oil:
9122 2018-02-12 02:31:27 Go to Walmart and get burn gel! I just got over a badass burn from oil on my wrist and nothing fucking works except for the cream I got. :( burns are so fuckin trash. Or if you know a nurse try and get silverdein.
9123 2018-02-12 02:31:16 Pence is unofficially acting presidential, where is the State Department? The Russian and Chinese freighters are still offloading coal and oil. A big nothing especially with Pence at the opening ceremony; did he bother to acknowledge those North Koreans?
9124 2018-02-12 02:31:10 My sister did a quick face scrub for me ...grapefruit juice, sugar & , sweet almond oil
9125 2018-02-12 02:31:04 #WorstCooks I agree...olive oil cake sounds nasty
9126 2018-02-12 02:30:56 @ArroyoIsCEO olive oil peach cake #yesplease
9127 2018-02-12 02:30:49 The infamous oil well on the bev hills high school property. Guess in its day, added a million $ to the school district. No longer in use it's going to be removed one of these days. At someones expense.

9131 2018-02-12 02:29:53 Well oatmeal and bananas are SUPER easy and honestly so is everything else. If you buy the pre packaged uncle Ben rice then you just have to heat it up in the microwave and it has two servicing per bag. Veggies are easy too, just put them in a pan with a little olive oil and
9132 2018-02-12 02:29:41 I wonder if tequila/lime juice/olive oil/raw chicken juice is good for your feet.... considering I just SPILLED A WHOLE BAG OF MARINADE ON THE FLOOR AND MY FEET I’m not okay

9135 2018-02-12 02:28:57 are today. After the crash, demand for oil decrease, Obama’s initiative for clean energy, crashed crude from $100 to like $20. Dollar was strong, euro reached $1.05. Plus rates were low. But regulation was making firms not take as much risk.
9136 2018-02-12 02:28:56 @FuelCell_Energy and @rethinkCCUS both have pilots with Husky Oil (in Canada, alas). FCE can stack value w/ electricity sales and H2 stream, to boot. EOR will always be more attractive than sequestration, I imagine...

9138 2018-02-12 02:28:29 Oil (-/=): US rig count +26 last week, most in a year, deepens concerns re shale supply, drags WTI <$60 for first time this year, pushing Brent <100dma. Near-term px hinges on OPEC monthly report (Mon), EIA's drilling outlook (Tue)

9140 2018-02-12 02:28:17 How tf vegetable oil ain’t a heterogeneous mixture!? It’s composed of various vegetables!!!
9141 2018-02-12 02:28:03 Subsidized cost (after the DOE grants) is about $53/ton I estimate. To get the target after-tax ROI, I estimate that NRG needed oil to be at about $82/barrel. If they can knock $30/ton off that price, that drops to about $36/barrel. Now they're in the money.
9142 2018-02-12 02:27:59 Let me rub this coconut oil all on your scalp how fucking romantic is that?
9143 2018-02-12 02:27:47 I’m coming over. Let’s get our claws covered in oil
9144 2018-02-12 02:27:47 Oil rents (most, maybe all) should go into long term savings that yield more stable annual income. Tax revenues should support spending. Cutting taxes because there was oil money was the height of stupidity.
9145 2018-02-12 02:27:41 And note there is no positive news at all  to support oil for a bounce...26 rigs UP is extremely bad news last friday..speculators always think it has to bounce after such  a falll..but fundamentals always catch up and this time it will be brutal:)
9146 2018-02-12 02:27:25 ugh yes. I had to get some hair oil for my poor ends and it was the best $X I've spent recently.
9147 2018-02-12 02:27:22 why does coconut oil never come fully out of my hair i literally scrub
9148 2018-02-12 02:27:00 My wife said the sous vide hasn’t been that good and had me do sear/oven tonight. It was actually way better. Only real difference was the amount of oil.
9149 2018-02-12 02:26:46 The fight for oil fields but many countries looking to no use oil in 20 years or so. Anyone see the brains to this fight? It is not just about oil, control the region and kill million of Muslims. Where does UAE and Saudi fit in, they don’t! However will only be used by Israel.
9150 2018-02-12 02:26:43 I've also been known to freeze basil in olive oil (using ice cube trays). Works pretty well and is super convenient.

9153 2018-02-12 02:26:09 wtf did i decide it was a good idea to put peppermint oil in my humidifier.. i am just more and more awake
9154 2018-02-12 02:25:55 RT @ogthegawd: Send her NUT vids with the oil. Yeah that 
9155 2018-02-12 02:25:46 a spoonful of coconut oil on an empty stomach is vital when intermittent fasting. I lost 10lbd in a week one time lol

9157 2018-02-12 02:25:05 All week long the Lucas Oil Late Models at East Bay have been some of the best races I've ever seen. Then there is tonight at Ocala...
9158 2018-02-12 02:24:28 I've smoked out of my rig before, but I would always fully clean it before dabbing out of it again. Bud is way dirtier than oil.
9159 2018-02-12 02:24:25 Can amount of oil affect that?
9160 2018-02-12 02:24:20 So oil fell in my phone ugh

9164 2018-02-12 02:23:44 Some amount of the CO2 is mineralized, some amount is recovered from the crude - note this does not include the CO2 that was already in the oil, which does not count - and re-injected and some amount leaks out. EOR is not ideal for long term storage.
9165 2018-02-12 02:23:21 Right. Maybe you should inhale less oil fumes?
9166 2018-02-12 02:23:20 Oh and you haven't seen MY popcorn.  I have a Whirly-Pop, a GALLON of coconut oil, authentic 'buttery topping' and a carton of Flavacol.  I can make fully authentic movie theater popcorn with all the calories.
9167 2018-02-12 02:23:19 So I bought this bottle called Unicorn Tears oil and you’re supposed to put a couple drops in the bath so it can moisturize your skin 
9168 2018-02-12 02:23:02 Coconut oil
9169 2018-02-12 02:22:48 I was 20 in 1979 working on the oil rigs. Got drunk on tequila for the first time and went to the top of the Derrick, unbuckled my safety harness and posed for a picture standing on the thin-ass railing holding on to the flag pole. Dumbass. That's only one of several.
9170 2018-02-12 02:22:42 Pada periode 2006 - 2011, juga ada MOU dan bahkan Sudah membuat Perusahaan patungan antara Grup Al-aidit dari malaysia dengan Pemda Aceh dlm hal ini BPKS, Akta perusahaan PMA dan izin investasi nya sudah keluar, bisnis Oil city dan oil regenerasi pulau aceh.....mana hasilnya...?

9172 2018-02-12 02:22:08 Unless it's the world's worst oil spill.
9173 2018-02-12 02:21:34 Yeah, thanks for the pay hike @GOP .  Helps offset the rise in gas prices. Wasn't @SpeakerRyan  in Saudi Arabia two weeks ago?  Should I buy oil stocks now?  Also, will my refund disappear next year like when GHW Bush gave us a 'tax cut'?
9174 2018-02-12 02:21:32 Yikes! What sort of machinery gets damaged by a power outage? The plant I worked at was just turbines so if the plant went blank, backup oil pumps would kick on and the assembly would cost down over 20 minutes or so.

9178 2018-02-12 02:21:11 same smh I think the only thing that’s actually kept me matte is milk of magnesia but it’s terrible for skin and estee lauder doublewear foundation has been the best at oil control for me but it’s so expensive & i’ve switched to mineral face makeup so eh
9179 2018-02-12 02:21:05 Im using a "goodnight oil" blend with sage and orange in it in my bong water and I feel like I'm microdosing acid om like tired and creative feeling
9180 2018-02-12 02:20:32 idk why i just put castor oil in my scalp like my hair not already oily
9181 2018-02-12 02:20:27 tea tree oil in the morning and maracuja oil at night alright guys (after washing your face obviously)
9182 2018-02-12 02:20:21 The tariff is not economically defensible...unless, as became clear in the EIA annual energy outlook pres on Feb 6, it helps the US oil & gas industry become a dominant a fossil fuel exporter in the future as OPEC is today. The tariff isn’t a tax on solar; it’s a subsidy to O&G.
9183 2018-02-12 02:20:18 Japan imports its energy needs. I think rising oil prices can create significant economic pressure. Ultimately, economics wins out and politicians will OK restarts. With massive debt and deficits the Japanese can not put their trade surpluses at risk.
9184 2018-02-12 02:20:14 The only true 'expensive pee' supplements r fish oil/prob.

9185 2018-02-12 02:20:01 I had it years ago... I used to combination of coconut oil and with a few drops of Teatree oil and lavender oil during the day and jock itch medicated cream at night. Also wash your sheets and towels every night or change them out.
9186 2018-02-12 02:19:22 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
9187 2018-02-12 02:19:08 For breakfast I do two cups of oatmeal with a banana and water. For lunch I do 4oz of grilled chicken breast with a cup of rice and a cup of broccoli and same thing for supper.  But you can substitute the chicken for tuna, turkey, tilapia, etc.  I use olive oil when cooking the

9205 2018-02-12 02:15:17 #DismissMeNoLonger That last entry my cell messed up.  Sleep "apnea" was typed...twice.  Have you seen the old film Alonso's Oil? An MRI image of a boy's head showed nothing but white for his brain matter after a two year rapid deterioration of his health. Normal is no white.
9206 2018-02-12 02:15:16 I never got this. It wastes water (or booze or whatever) and it just washes off your sunscreen and/or oil (especially if booze).

9210 2018-02-12 02:14:26 @Kinger999 that's an awful take. They traded the 16th pick after pick 15 was made. And had no interest in Barzal (a near consensus 5-10 pick) had they kept the pick. Most people - Oil fan or not - thought that was terrible the second they made it.

9231 2018-02-12 02:11:45 Why not have a energy import rule where we block the import of foreign oil into Canada from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela?
9232 2018-02-12 02:11:37 This eucalyptus oil is getting this eczema breakout tf outta here 
9233 2018-02-12 02:11:25 My asshole is burning from that spicy DIY ramen last night. Why the hell did you add sriracha and chili garlic oil kasi, Vit!?
9234 2018-02-12 02:11:18 If it is not for Putin world crude prc could hv plunged lower then what it's today. Putin need crude prc up for bulk of Russian economy depends on oil.

At the same time with oil prc up it helps other nations dependent on oil production. Is Putin good or bad? Whatever he is smart
9235 2018-02-12 02:11:13 100% pure coconut oil smells so good
9236 2018-02-12 02:11:13 Yeah. Lots of coconut oil, then PB and cocoa powder and a little sweetener. It was amazing. Also tried to make a peppermint chocolate type but it needs more tweaking.
9237 2018-02-12 02:10:55 2017 was all about coconut oil, this year its Fresh Aloe Vera Gel !!!!
9238 2018-02-12 02:10:54 It’s so crazy bc I just stocked up on the eco styler x black castor oil mix and now they have thiiiiiissssss.

9241 2018-02-12 02:10:32 Huh... Thought I had to pipe oil into the sides of generators? Maybe that's just 1.10 though.
9242 2018-02-12 02:10:29 Gas prices are going up and why none of the news TV stations question it, and why because they are owned by the oil companies. Every time they want us to feel good about the price hikes they put it on the news and they act like there's nothing we can do about it.

9245 2018-02-12 02:09:43 Your words are a great way to end my meal. Now.....onward to a glorious sleep. Tomorrow you'll have to tell me about magic mushrooms. Interesting stories are bound to expose themselves while you, me, and the Canadian prepare the roast bull :)
9246 2018-02-12 02:09:42 Lemongrass oil smells like lemon pez candy. I'm so relaxed. Lord knows I need this.
9247 2018-02-12 02:09:37 Great job Bo Butner starting off the season with a victory defending your NHRA Championship. Keep up the awesome job and looking forward to many more victories this season !

9251 2018-02-12 02:09:20 Great argument! Who do you teach? 5th graders?
9252 2018-02-12 02:09:17 When the oil extracted via EOR gets burned is the CO2 then captured?
I have a hard time understanding how CO2 that is used for EOR can actually be considered CCS.
9253 2018-02-12 02:08:47 I have the one with just black castor oil and flaxseed gel, and it works wonders! I use it to retwist no buildup

9256 2018-02-12 02:07:47 I lost my baby oil gel. 
9257 2018-02-12 02:07:34 Happy for the longs that are making some of those losses back.  #WTI #OOTT $CL  Hate to see anyone lose money. Good luck all.
9258 2018-02-12 02:07:24 Silent majority my backside, if you’re for a new pipeline you’re clearly not informed well enough or working for oil and gas which doesn’t care about any other industry other than themselves and will put everything else at risk without due concern.
9259 2018-02-12 02:07:23 Wonder if he let Pence oil him.
9260 2018-02-12 02:07:22 You probably met with some oil and gas lobbyists after you spoke, right? Now, do you hug Robert Murray when you meet him, like Rick Perry?
9261 2018-02-12 02:07:06 fuckin sunday night, a caked myself in coconut oil, face masks, the lot to try & stay in & yet still ended up oot til this hour like a big greasy haired fuck, wearing a boys trackie & nae bra, stinkin of pina coladas.

9267 2018-02-12 02:05:51 I had it. It’s truly hideous. I’m so sorry. Stay away from sugar and take oil of oregano. Lots of sleep and fluids. I blamed Trump too. He’s lowered our collective immune system.
9268 2018-02-12 02:05:41 The eco styled coconut oil is the best hands down .
9269 2018-02-12 02:05:35 Just picture the Tonga flag guy with short hair, grey beard and more oil
9270 2018-02-12 02:05:20 Recently on my truck @ 140k miles I replaced the timing chain, distributor, got new windshield wipers, spark plugs, a new air & fuel filter plus had an oil change. I also need a new tire & ac hose plus one other hose and eventually a new fuel pump or injector. #Nissan #Frontier
9271 2018-02-12 02:05:08 I used peppermint oil and coffee grounds all over my body and now I feel that minty freshness all over my body and I’m freezing my ass off and I can’t warm up LOLOLOL rip
9272 2018-02-12 02:04:55 She speaks in words dripping with vegetable oil: slippery and difficult to pin down, like "alternative facts".
9273 2018-02-12 02:04:54 I actually might have peppermint oil..... for sure lavender if I ran out of peppermint. thank you you’re the sweetest
9274 2018-02-12 02:04:51 They’re covered in oil now
9275 2018-02-12 02:04:45 How about burying the past once and for all and set all your focus on the present and future?? After last years run we were suppose to go further this year!! I celebrated back in 1984 with the team but it’s gone and I’m ready to celebrate with this team! Giddy up Oil!!
9276 2018-02-12 02:04:30 I was running the Moroccan oil through my moms hair and brushing it while listening to lil Kennedy and it was a really happy moment, the piano made it even more perfect 
9277 2018-02-12 02:04:16 Oh, please do! I swear by tea tree oil to clear pimples and lavender too calm me down.
9278 2018-02-12 02:03:56 I had the same reaction last night after the Oil tied it up last night and in the end lost it... again.
9279 2018-02-12 02:03:19 Sir u added oil to the fire no words @MusicThaman killing BGM in 2nd half and @IAmVarunTej @RaashiKhanna performance

9281 2018-02-12 02:03:10 I broke out from clearasil a few months back and ever since nothing works. not peppermint soap, not shea butter, not coconut oil, not lemon juice, not witch hazel, not acv.

Yall love lying to me
9282 2018-02-12 02:03:09 statins for me were like my fish oil supplements and exercise; they helped me rationalize, feel "bulletproof";all above are pushed by mass media, kept me ignorant and instinctively eating ALL wrong! the guidelines didn't help either

9285 2018-02-12 02:02:45 LMFAO THE COCONUT OIL
9286 2018-02-12 02:02:42 I have multiple coworkers who have it and they are paying anywhere between 400-800 per month for electric baseboard. Gas and Oil heat are always going to be less expensive, unless you have your own solar array making enough juice.
9287 2018-02-12 02:02:41 If you have ginger or peppermint oil. Those are best to use, secondary is lavender
9288 2018-02-12 02:02:40 I just used olive oil. I’m vv regretful. Butter sauce next time.
9289 2018-02-12 02:02:37 @EstherPassaris 
After U fan a civil war amongst Kenyans, and America is busy stealing our almost nothing oil in Turkana County.
9290 2018-02-12 02:02:37 I'm so tired of being sick but I'm even more tired of people telling me what's wrong with and what doctor to see. I'm tired of hearing about snake oil remedies and cure alls....especially going vegan. I'm done with it. Leave me alone.
9291 2018-02-12 02:02:16 I just wanted to be beautiful and natural for once and put some castor oil on my face. And now that shits burnin' my eyebrows awayyyy fuckin' fuckshit for fuck's sake. I'm done.

9295 2018-02-12 02:01:26 I need hair oil
9296 2018-02-12 02:01:24 about USD value and inflation... that component... that’s not straight forward...isn’t it? Crude oil goes straight into inflation that is...
9297 2018-02-12 02:01:11 @CanadianTire Is there a supply chain disruption with your stock of Lucas oil products?
9298 2018-02-12 02:01:04 Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest.
9299 2018-02-12 02:00:50 Or does the Green Party oppose all fossil fuel development? It needs to be phased out - oil isn't going away immediately. Lobby to increase investment in solar & biz development for solar industry along with pipeline. You have the power to lobby for alternative investment. 2/2

9302 2018-02-12 02:00:06 Hmm horrifying indeed. At least it's a woman. Mine brought up an oil painting of a nude woman on a couch. Inspired me to grow a beard again.
9303 2018-02-12 01:59:52 I got a question i need answered ASAP! Can u bring a weed oil pen on an airplane with u ???
9304 2018-02-12 01:59:45 just add coconut oil to your smoothies and tea and it will give you all the benefits without the potential breakouts putting it on your face would give you.
9305 2018-02-12 01:59:39 頑張って下さいね〜！
9306 2018-02-12 01:59:38 Both have relative advantages based in ehich one you grew up in. Mine was a small-medium sized one near all the big oil plants. So honestly its all about nostalgia and quiet solidarity for me.
9307 2018-02-12 01:59:33 Snake oil, Time will tell. Relax Donald, stop telling people how awesome you are before markets actually truly adjust. You may be right but let the market truly adjust.

9311 2018-02-12 01:58:38 วันนี้ยิ่งกว่าอีกกกกกกกก
9312 2018-02-12 01:57:50 more builds..overall market is weakening..over leveraged longs who want to exit desperately now..fall also technically below 50 day and below 60 levels and losing the gains for the year is a crushing blow to the long narrative.
9313 2018-02-12 01:57:38 I love robotic oil poffins~!
9314 2018-02-12 01:57:19 The condition of my car accurately describes my life. This week alone I’ve gotten a parking ticket, locked my keys in the car X2 & now I’m running on E & need an oil change.
9315 2018-02-12 01:57:14 it’s sunday night, i got my face mask on backwards and it’s time to fucking party *dumps entire relaxation oil blend into diffuser*
9316 2018-02-12 01:57:04 Extra olive oil is the best  
9317 2018-02-12 01:57:01 ...As to how Dan.8 &11 "antichrist", apparently of Mideast, could be 1& the same as the worldwide "beast" of power in Rev.13-19 [besides the stark similarities tweeted already], consider that he'd be famous for brokering [false] Mideast peace,& he'd control Mideast oil resources!
9318 2018-02-12 01:57:00 Having traveled a lot in the Nordic regions since 1998, I would aver that Norway’s happiness comes directly from its well managed oil money economy. And it’s mostly a white country.

9322 2018-02-12 01:56:31 The keynote speaker should be removed as well. In fact, the entire parade of pseudo science promoters, quack cures distributors, & snake oil salesmen shouldn't even be able to market such a ghastly gathering. Why a rational person would attend such a circus is beyond me.
9323 2018-02-12 01:56:13 I followed @VincePomal recommendation of low and slow. Was 350 for 90ish minutes, with garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper.

9330 2018-02-12 01:55:09 I got an essential oil diffuser after listening to @michellevisage @RuPaul podcast and just set it up. I feel so grounded and at peace already
9331 2018-02-12 01:54:57 We couldn't afford it with oil at $100 a barrel  since oil fluctuates.  That's the short-term thinking that got us into this mess.
9332 2018-02-12 01:54:54 If you use coconut oil as lube it’s almost like a tropical vacation.
9333 2018-02-12 01:54:50 Interesting, my taxes appear to have gone up, plus rising gas prices, oil rates high, health insurance increasing, I am not seeing a benefit!
9334 2018-02-12 01:54:42 Follow all and retweet
9335 2018-02-12 01:54:42 I can't afford heating oil! But I wish I could be there

9343 2018-02-12 01:54:06 No one's ignoring last year but almost everything went perfectly and Talbot was among the best 5 goalies in the league. Expecting that to occur again wasn't realistic and especially not w/ a roster that wasn't as good. They are somewhere in between & that isn't good enough.
9344 2018-02-12 01:54:04 i spilled a bunch of very hot oil on my hand last night while making dinner and my hand doesn't have a single blemish. 

either i'm actually immune to burning or extremely lucky but its very clearly a sign that i should've been a fire fighter.
9345 2018-02-12 01:53:39 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.

9349 2018-02-12 01:53:32 CS on OMCs: With oil prices now down to US$63/bbl, and CS long-term
expectations at US60/bbl, we see low risk to marketing margins for
the OMC. All three stocks trade at an inexpensive 9.5-10.0x FY19
EPS, and have dividend yields in the 4.5-6.0% range. Prefer
BPCL/IOCL.

9351 2018-02-12 01:53:14 oil paints look so interesting I wish I had some
9352 2018-02-12 01:53:13 Wind and Solar don't run out and you can't choke to death on them. They provide more jobs than oil and coal and FRACK . Why would we turn away from CLEAN  NRG???
9353 2018-02-12 01:52:55 I'll be at Island Naturals, Hilo from 11-1 this Tuesday. I'll have essential oil samples plus hugs, smiles and laughter to share!
9354 2018-02-12 01:52:48 At least you see your team winning. Better than the Oil
9355 2018-02-12 01:52:40 I'm an Engineer &have been in male dominated workforce 17yrs. (Oil&Gas). Topic &approach isnt forcing STEM but encouraging it w/ young girls/teenagers. It's amazing how often they don't see it as options if not encouraged. In Houston, Hvy Industry, we need more women in sciences.
9356 2018-02-12 01:52:31 Massive supply glut=low oil prices=high cost producer struggling=massive attack.  We need oil for now, but we need to start diversifying our economy and energy which will create more job growth.  Not just from oil.  Didn’t he learn anything from the last two recessions. #ableg

9367 2018-02-12 01:51:23 Bottom line on all of this - we are only 500,000 people but built a bureaucracy for 10 million people. We could afford it at $105 a barrel oil. Now we can’t but we can’t just cut jobs. There has to be compassionate adjustment. This is new territory. We only get one chance.

9371 2018-02-12 01:50:43 Thanks! I take pain meds for fibromyalgia but really thinking about starting CBD oil since it's legal here in Oregon. You don't get high from it but get relief.

9375 2018-02-12 01:49:49 Yes! and I would get a soft brush, and then i use the ors oil moisturizer, throw that on whenever you feel like it, brush everyday, durag before you go to bed. Then it’ll eventually happen.

9422 2018-02-12 01:43:32 There is a reasonable fundamental case for that via softening rents (huge chunk of CPI) & falling oil prices (though this one will be fleeting). There is also more labor market slack than people estimate (working age people out of the workforce). I’ll post the charts below.

9443 2018-02-12 01:40:43 That curling match was not an oil painting but a gutsy performance by Johnny Mo and Lawes. Doubles curling is fun to watch.
9444 2018-02-12 01:40:19 It’s the oil on the lanes. They can make it as easy or as hard as possible.

9447 2018-02-12 01:39:35 So the idea was Putin would help Trump win the elections , Putin would send Tillerson to help Trump lift sanctions , they drill for the oil , Trump gets 6.5% of the eight billion dollars deal..

9457 2018-02-12 01:38:03 From a personal view the only keys for an endgame of the crisis in #VENEZUELA are concrete and factual oil sanctions increased Intl pressure and no recognition of presidential election results.. this way something relevant might happen other wise nothing will.. #oott

9461 2018-02-12 01:36:48 I helped someone not lease cars with 1/3 of their ss for the rest of their life recently.  They had literally never understood the math, were close to paid off, and weren't car people.  Also helped a cashier not trade in their 3 year old Honda once while getting an oil change.
9462 2018-02-12 01:36:30 “Hm... I cook. Pretty likes my cookin’ so I cook to make him smile.” He starts the vegetables boiling then shifts to flour and brown the beef cubes in oil. The smell of the seasonings roll through the space.

9471 2018-02-12 01:35:48 Just like big oil subsidies, the tariff are here to stay. We need to use our innovation and make products here that can compete with China. Again, one of us is right the other is wrong. Time will tell us who is who.
9472 2018-02-12 01:35:47 The current correction in the market is seen in crude oil hitting 52 weeks highs, and USD hitting new lows... that signals inflation, which pushed yields to multi years highs. High interest rates is bad for business since money is more expensive.

9481 2018-02-12 01:34:29 Requiring oil and gas companies to clean up their drilling sites, mines, and tailings ponds will have them "thinking twice" about investing in Canada, too, but we must do this nevertheless.

9505 2018-02-12 01:29:39 None of the major oil companies saw this coming. A black swan event.

9521 2018-02-12 01:27:52 We need that #Oil #AbuDhabi..  we love our fried food in #India
9522 2018-02-12 01:27:52 I got to make a meal out of random shit in the fridge with nobody bitching about my vegetable choice. (Cavatelli, brussel sprouts, chicken meatballs, tomato, olive oil).
9523 2018-02-12 01:27:41 Since I started my essential oil kick, I swear I’m ready to go to bed every night at like 7:30. They just make me so relaxed and sleepy 
9524 2018-02-12 01:27:34 Yeah it’s got salmon oil, cat nip etc 
9525 2018-02-12 01:26:54 Amazing sexy and sensual oil show ~ Too hot for words!!!  
9526 2018-02-12 01:26:42 Poor boy!  They destroyed their own oil industry.  Where were sanctions on that?

Why did Soviet Union implode?  Why did they have guns pointed INWARD in East Germany?  You Marxist tools are too much!
9527 2018-02-12 01:26:42 Pake bio oil
9528 2018-02-12 01:26:33 What about applying an oil to your skin care routine?  nada? 
9529 2018-02-12 01:26:32 Good thing! Might want to invest in some tea tree oil hair products if the hat swapping becomes a regular thing! You looked good in the ball cap but not nearly as sexy as the cowgirl hat @TerriClarkMusic  Great show last night!

9531 2018-02-12 01:26:20 News Flash for Ignorant Greeners: the oil and gas industry gave America its wonderful standard of living - and supported the infrastructure and businesses of this country to make our great technical innovations possible -

9533 2018-02-12 01:25:54 “Hey! My cologne is awesome! At least I don’t smell like oil.”
9534 2018-02-12 01:25:52 Hoping this rain stops so I can take a decent picture of this oil painting at some point
9535 2018-02-12 01:25:44 Why France don't have greasy food delivery service at 2:00 am. I can eat the most gross frie only for feel the oil rn.
9536 2018-02-12 01:25:32 The cole slaw was the best, rice wine vinegar, sweet chili sauce, bit of oil of this receipe
9537 2018-02-12 01:25:28 Today I went to the grocery store. 

They were out of the on sale olive oil I wanted.

I went to the customer service desk for a raincheck.

And thus became my mother.

9538 2018-02-12 01:25:23 I understand that but I don’t like teachers pay being used to settle political scores. That is part of my problem. Also, it doesn’t address why oil and gas are bragging about them still paying the lowest taxes in the country after this plan.
9539 2018-02-12 01:25:21 Still sick...  Tasha told me to rub tea tree oil under my feet.   Trying another (disgusting) hot toddy....   And now crying like a baby watching The Vow.... #flu #Flu2018 #FckOffFFlu #DieFlu #EnoughAlready #HopeflessMovieRomantic
9540 2018-02-12 01:24:58 Y la empresa que mas se beneficia,paso a ser socia de un shopping,que tal? A costillas de los que consumen gas oil,pero nadie se dio cuenta,se les paso

3. I spend a lot of my summers oil painting
9544 2018-02-12 01:24:04 EPS for Advantage Oil & Gas Ltd. (AAV) Expected At $0....
9545 2018-02-12 01:24:02 You guys should bring back the circular rostie. The rectangle ones aren’t as good and soak up the oil 
9546 2018-02-12 01:23:52 Maybe she needs to take a ride on her bicycle, in the snow and ice to clear her #Barbie head!  Will be interesting to see what #Barbie will do when there is no more gas, oil or electricity!
9547 2018-02-12 01:23:48 She started out in oils. She never got into watercolor until much later.That portrait of me is oil. She was 18 and I was 8, if I remember correctly.

9549 2018-02-12 01:23:39 I wonder if coconut oil has insulating properties?
9550 2018-02-12 01:23:34 @RachelNotley What if I wrote to your inbox? Would you publish that I don’t back your support of Kinder Morgan? That I think the Prime Minister Let his campaign values go in favour of big business? Or that you’re bullying small business in favour of big oil? #BCPoli

9555 2018-02-12 01:22:53 How did they know it wouldn't work? VZ's GDP quadrupled after Chavez got in. How were they to know US would ramp up oil production and crash prices?

And even if they did know the US would interfere, so what? That's still the US to blame for that interference.

9558 2018-02-12 01:22:37 I’d definitely try rosehip oil and see how you like it. I think the ordinary makes an affordable one

9563 2018-02-12 01:21:37 And now we know a bit more about olive oil 
9564 2018-02-12 01:21:33 Oil tycoon? 
9565 2018-02-12 01:21:23 We’re getting our coconut oil treatment on tonight. Hair is hongry.
9566 2018-02-12 01:21:22 Pinks new coconut oil is eveeeerthing
9567 2018-02-12 01:21:21 If BH are "completely defeated", so should the Senate not investigate those that initiated the oil search that exposed our Citizens to harmsway and death? How many of such negligence should the FG always ignore as if the lives of Nigerians does not matter?
9568 2018-02-12 01:21:02 like how people need to open their eyes to the brutal US regime and what they do to ME countries based on lies for oil and gas?
9569 2018-02-12 01:20:41 When I use shampoo without any oil or moisturizer in it you can dead ass start a fire with my hair so basically we could survive if we were ever stranded in the woods. Wow I’m a total package.
9570 2018-02-12 01:20:37 And ALL of my jajoba oil for my hair spilled. I’m over this day
9571 2018-02-12 01:20:24 Decompressing from the day's stress has now been reduced to watching those little mini ocean machines where the oil goes in red drops from one wheel to the other
9572 2018-02-12 01:20:19 I Wash with Dr. Bronner's rose oil pure Castile soap

9573 2018-02-12 01:19:57 Of course I am an investor in the oil and gas industry - I Iove drilling rigs - the roughneck teams operating them - America’s ready men - and pipelines and the guys who build them and refineries and LNG and offshore platforms and tankers and American energy independence
9574 2018-02-12 01:19:52 Yesss I definitely use organic stuff that has none of those things! Looking up bio oil now lol.
9575 2018-02-12 01:19:49 I like the sc update. Y'all mf just slow

9578 2018-02-12 01:19:23 Your climate policy is funded by Rockefeller family fortune who has an agenda to sell Canadian oil at a discount- u seriously expect us to believe the opposition is based on science? Please!!!
9579 2018-02-12 01:19:14 I challenge any American to tell me how exactly what's going on in Venezuela or even where it is on the map. I can find it on a map but other than that all I know is the US government doesn't like them and they have an economy overdependent on oil. We should stay out of it
9580 2018-02-12 01:19:10 “Unspecified Security concerns” - what is he concerned that someone is going to toss crude oil on him?

9592 2018-02-12 01:17:29 Ooh I’ll try I usually just use liquid soap. Also oil like olive oil mixed with soap is meant to work really well I’m yet to try
9593 2018-02-12 01:17:28 โอ้ยยยย อยากนอนนน
9594 2018-02-12 01:17:18 Nope - Worst Venezuela oil consumption comparable to syncude. Canada bitumen comparable to Alaska. Efficiency makes bigger difference by burning less but all oil is "dirty" no matter source. Not Canada's job to destroy economy while USA, Venezuela etc still produce #cdnpoli

Rachel— especially because I don’t wanna be all drugged up.. there’s gatta be an oil for it #308lovesoils
9596 2018-02-12 01:17:02 Whats confusing? We know they wiped out all humans. (Wasn't just dinosaurs, ancient forests also became oil)
9597 2018-02-12 01:16:35 We have more oil than they do! North America is set... except we're not because Saudi cash
9598 2018-02-12 01:16:28 Cathy, tell all those oil producers to lower their prices and not spend their $ on posts on Twitter. Also, aim towards renewable sources more. 10% is ridiculous with as much profit as you make.
9599 2018-02-12 01:16:13 sebab tea tree oil kot????
9600 2018-02-12 01:16:09 O yeah and it's Girl Scout Cookies vape oil.... Just bump some music and relax

9603 2018-02-12 01:15:46 #Sydney to grow for 40 years? There are not enough resources (gas, oil, water, renewable electricity). Sydney's West will be so hot in 4 decades it will become very uncomfortable there to live.
9604 2018-02-12 01:15:34 This whole thing is triggering. Why would States compete for a 20% match when right now they can get 80% with no competition. Snake oil imo
9605 2018-02-12 01:15:06 I feel like my vanilla oil doesn’t smell like vanilla. It smells good but not vanilla. I don’t even know what it smells like.
9606 2018-02-12 01:14:45 One would hope that all the oil and gas disasters would've been enough for any good leader to say enough. The only energy solution for tomorrow is clean and renewable energy that doesn't harm the environment, people or animals.

9610 2018-02-12 01:13:53 3/4 c PB
1/4 c butter softened
1/4 c Brown sugar
1 1/2 c powdered sugar

Mix all of it up, roll it out, cookie cut.
Freeze.

Melt chocolate chips and dip. Freeze again. I added 1-2 tbsps of coconut oil to the chocolate to help thin it out.
9611 2018-02-12 01:13:41 i mix two drops of bio oil with a drop of tea tree oil and put that all over my face then i go back with just straight up tea tree oil and put that on deep pimples when i get them
9612 2018-02-12 01:13:40 aaliyah jay got me confused because I didn’t think an oil diffuser is a skin product?? am I wrong?? she trippin??
9613 2018-02-12 01:13:33 When govts say that they have no business to be in business but then they are still in business, strategic or not. Why not govt. run a business whereby everyone gets free food. Why not leverage India's potential like its land. Every country does that like UAE for its oil.
9614 2018-02-12 01:13:30 You definitely have the market cornered on what is stupid.
9615 2018-02-12 01:13:30 Got so damn tired of taking biotin and only seeing my nails grow that i crushed the supplements and poured it into my hair oil mix. I’ll let yall know what happens 
9616 2018-02-12 01:13:22 I think she has worked very hard for 2yrs now, to show the utter disdain she seems to have towards men. She has been pushing women over men to the point I think she needs help. My grandson is in the oil fields and he will show his answer to her in 2019.

9618 2018-02-12 01:13:17 I deleted the tweet as the link to the petition is from a company that does not support sustainable palm oil.  There is a lot of controversy and confusion over the definition of certifiable/sustainable.
9619 2018-02-12 01:13:02 Badtrip yung may magbubukas ng Efficascent Oil sa pampublikong sasakyan. Nakaka arouse amputaaaa
9620 2018-02-12 01:12:58 Right. And we didn’t spend a century fighting costly wars for oil. And still issue cheap or free leases to drill on public land. To say nothing of the huge asymmetry in tax receipts and general economic relevance paid by liberal places vs. conservative ones.
9621 2018-02-12 01:12:53 ahh well thats why i used the avocado oil, it has such a high smoke point
9622 2018-02-12 01:12:51 そうですね！女性の扱い方もカップラーメンもトリセツは大切です（笑）
9623 2018-02-12 01:12:40 Ooh thanks for letting me know your routine, I might check out bio oil and see how it goes!
9624 2018-02-12 01:12:34 The ultimate villains were the Saudis and the NGOs there; financing all sorts of activist crap. After they killed the Keystone pipeline, our people had to look for options. Greens trying to landlock oil sands.
9625 2018-02-12 01:12:18 I need someone with the oil connect what's good Twitter fam?
9626 2018-02-12 01:12:14 lemon water & coconut oil are the answer to everything dont fucking @ me
9627 2018-02-12 01:12:09 Pffft you're both still hella young!! Nail oil is needed though i think for your pinkies XD keep em strong!
9628 2018-02-12 01:12:01 I’ll ride with you brah.
9629 2018-02-12 01:11:58 Rosewater spray to close pores & calm skin. Grapesead or Jojoba oil as moisturizer. Tee tree oil diluted with grapeseed or jojoba oil works GREAT as an overnight spot treatment.
9630 2018-02-12 01:11:45 Won't help at all if they aren't used, or worse yet someone thinks they never need to check the oil if they wear there seatbelt
9631 2018-02-12 01:11:42 Most people trust the media, it's you we don't trust. Once a snake oil salesman always a snake oil saleman.
9632 2018-02-12 01:11:41 Check engine light came on, and not in a "change the oil" kind of way. I do have a limited warranty, so I gotta sort that out tomorrow.

I'm glad I fixed my bike! 
9633 2018-02-12 01:11:33 I just had a thing of veggies so I put some avocado oil to cook them and just did that. I marinated the chicken in this honey sesame sauce and just cooked the rice from the box. Not hard.
9634 2018-02-12 01:11:24 Dear @Wawa, 

I love you very much. You're my favorite. I would love you even more if you brought back hard salami to your menu for more than just the Italian sub so I could have my hard salami /provolone /lettuce/oil & vinegar on a shorti.  That is all.

Love you

9641 2018-02-12 01:10:01 I just coconut oil my body down
9642 2018-02-12 01:09:59 I use coconut oil
9643 2018-02-12 01:09:53 Great invention @TruTension let's hope the chain cleaner etc is more environmentally friendly as Deborah asked i.e. use orange oil or vinegar mix
9644 2018-02-12 01:09:22 sounds like i need to give this a try.  Currently i have been finishing it in cast iron using avocado oil
9645 2018-02-12 01:09:19 This happened with the tar sands, where Canada threatened to export the oil to the Chinese of all nations. Disgusting. And I think that was Harper.
9646 2018-02-12 01:09:13 5 years ago I barely knew how to change oil in my cars.  Now I've done brakes, calipers, starters, ebrakes, struts, alternators, gaskets etc... all learned mainly by research, youtube videos and persistence.  If I could only get that diagnostic skill down I'd be happier!

9649 2018-02-12 01:09:06 They lose revenue from the oil
9650 2018-02-12 01:08:56 Ooooh I’ve wanted to check out bio oil but was nervous it would totally mess up my skin because it is sooo oily 
9651 2018-02-12 01:08:30 Don't forget to change the oil when you are done.
9652 2018-02-12 01:08:19 Use a shampoo and conditioner that are sulfate free especially if you have well water because that dries out hair really bad. And I swear by argon and coconut oil as well
9653 2018-02-12 01:07:56 Tesla is a fad just as you would have said motor vehicles were a fad when horse drawn carriages were common - if you had stakes in oil.
9654 2018-02-12 01:07:46 in mining, oil and gas industries - AND no jobs in those industries depending on them - like manufacturers who need electricity and gas. When @AustralianLabor are the government (which seems inevitable) the price they put on carbon - is also a price on jobs. No Magic Pudding.
9655 2018-02-12 01:07:44 Free energy technology is on the approach. The scheme of War for Oil will be confronted with litigation for war crimes, crimes against humanity and our Earth. Karma has a way of making things right. #truthalwaysurvives

9659 2018-02-12 01:06:16 i used it but it goes bad pretty quickly even if you put it in the fridge. but i did like it when i used it. I would mix it in my moisturizer when i had it. I currently use a glycolic acid serum that i mix with my marula oil.
9660 2018-02-12 01:06:11 A little olive oil, salt and pepper.

9665 2018-02-12 01:05:05 Watching from Soddy Daisy Tn all week and still havent had a shout out. Cant wait for the lucas oil race @BoydsSpeedway
9666 2018-02-12 01:05:01 Love those...I have  mint "donkey kong
 and "oil panic" portables. Given to me straight from Japan in the early 80s...
9667 2018-02-12 01:04:52 No, I want a plan that actually doesn’t bankrupt the state when the cigarette tax goes belly up. I want oil and gas to pay their fair share and not use teachers pay as an excuse to attack wind energy. I would rather have no pay raise than one that is bad policy-wise
9668 2018-02-12 01:04:25 To be fair, Pruit is by far the most competent most corrupt cabinet member Team Trump has. The environmental damage, the selling out of Public lands to Big Oil & the Koch Oligarchy has been awe-inspiring.
9669 2018-02-12 01:04:20 your wcw uses tea tree oil full strength and cannot be messed with. it's me, ya girl
9670 2018-02-12 01:04:20 When will you guys post the new point standings? TV didn’t show the points.
9671 2018-02-12 01:04:14 Russia would usually be in control of most of Europe’s energy usage, but liquified natural gas (LNG) from America and the possibility of oil from North Africa and the Middle East significantly weakens its power in being able to do so.
9672 2018-02-12 01:04:13 I don’t think I have peanut oil but I damn well might buy some this week.
9673 2018-02-12 01:04:06 Yeah that's right since they can't generate money from oil they have imposed 5% VAT, doubled petrol price,3 times electricity bill, expats dependents fee which gets double every year, fee on expat employees, several jobs and businesses restricted to Saudis only etc.......
9674 2018-02-12 01:03:51 Congrats @BoKnowsRacing @KBRacing1 on winning the @NHRA @MelloYello @Lucas_Oil #Winternats
9675 2018-02-12 01:03:42 Less costly to squirt oil out of wells than to dig up country side for coal!
Can pump oil & gas through pipes easier than loading & unloading coal. NO dangerous byproduct to remove like coal ash! AND even if ONLY BATTERY cars WE'd still need to process oil for road building tars!
9676 2018-02-12 01:03:35 @adamcarolla 25k to change oil on a Bugatti, could the lackys do it cheaper?
9677 2018-02-12 01:03:35 Doesn't matter where oil is used and your analysis is wrong. Final CO2 from combustion of a bbl is same-this is basic chemistry so go do your homework. You seem to be confusing efficiency here-consuming fewer bbls indeed has more much more impact than production of the bbl
9678 2018-02-12 01:03:24 Guest speaker for our next Film is David Hawkins - 30 years in the Oil Industry talks about Fracking. Film is at 7pm Fractured Land at White Rock Community Centre .
9679 2018-02-12 01:03:20 Russia is looking to having China as its next big customer in the oil and natural gas field. They will supply China with 38 billion m3 of gas yearly in a $400B 30-year deal.
9680 2018-02-12 01:02:58 I vaporize cannabis and plan on switching to using oil.

9682 2018-02-12 01:02:52 All he’s doing is deregulating for oil, coal, gas and big banks.  And, lowering taxes for himself and the 1%.  He hasn’t created jobs because he hasn’t  put forth any policies besides that shitty tax plan. That dude is a hack!
9683 2018-02-12 01:02:47 I’ve been putting coconut oil in my beard lately... Changed my WHOLE life. 
9684 2018-02-12 01:02:40 Trump will stop at nothing to see our beautiful Earth covered in oil and tar sand. Sad days we are living in.
9685 2018-02-12 01:02:38 Congrats @MattHagan_FC @shoeracing on winning the @NHRA @MelloYello @Lucas_Oil #Winternats #fortheShoe
9686 2018-02-12 01:02:33 @LucasRacingTV  Having a Lucas Oil Racing TV late model party in Daytona North Florida with Rod Debbie & Cory Smith and visiting from Quincy Illinois Dave & Tanya Weitholder and from Monmouth, Illinois Tony & Shelly Deford. GREAT ANNOUNCERS AND CAMERAMEN AND SUPPORT STAFF.
9687 2018-02-12 01:02:25 Ive watched all week from Soddy Daisy Tn and still havent got a shout out. Cant wait for the lucas oil race @boydsspeedway#LORTV
9688 2018-02-12 01:02:16 Liberal logic: ISIS or Trudeau’s name for them “Returning Islamic Travellers” are no problem, but those Canadian oil patch workers are a danger to women.
9689 2018-02-12 01:02:16 Mann we will race anything lol racing farm tractors — watching Lucas Oil Pro Pulling League
9690 2018-02-12 01:02:14 Son  RT @JRonMelrose: Bruh you CANNOT trust no real potheads. Bruh i got some lemonade out my homie fridge, this nigga done mixed a whole bottle of thc oil in it. I cannot feel my fucking face
9691 2018-02-12 01:02:14 The real reason mining, oil and gas companies don't develop resources in Australia is the Green/Left with whom @AustralianLabor have a symbiotic relationship harangue the approval and development processes with Lawfare and protests to the point it becomes uneconomic = no jobs
9692 2018-02-12 01:02:12 @RealCrystalLowe That poor RV is burning oil like it's going out of style! Lol #POstables And does Norman even have a valid driver's license? @geoffgustafson #TheRoadLessTraveled
9693 2018-02-12 01:02:04 art school idealized: oil, canvas, marble
art school conceptualized: cardboard, glue sticks, actual trash
9694 2018-02-12 01:01:54 See, I’m at Target and I’m going to try these hair skin and nail by nature vitamins. I know they don’t have this. 
Where did you get that from? 
And have you been using? I have something similar but it’s like an oil.
9695 2018-02-12 01:01:43 You may want to read the whole article, it says that a pipeline expansion means that Canada will be able to ship oil to a variety of places and actually get a fair price for it.  This is what most people have been saying all along.
9696 2018-02-12 01:01:23 Someone remind me to get jasmine oil this week.
9697 2018-02-12 01:01:08 Aku lulusan teknik mesin ...jadi engineer...consultant oil and gass....jadi pilot..sekarang consultant di bank asing...hahahah...hidup untuk dinikmati
9698 2018-02-12 01:00:54 Chris came flying in the house to tell me that there's an oil stain on his jacket because my Uncle was praying for him and spilled it

9702 2018-02-12 01:00:11 Gonna Need a Fucken Oil Pump for the Integra man. The seal is leaking out oil
9703 2018-02-12 01:00:07 #Oil: We keep our neutral stance as we expect crude oil to trade close to its fair  value range of 45-55 USD.

9707 2018-02-12 01:00:02 So has the Saudi family but you greedy jackbags only care about money, so you fawn over the country with oil no  matter what they do, stop pretending you have principles or morals
9708 2018-02-12 00:59:48 Sorry to hear what you're both going thru Nile I hope you read my DM sent last Dec 6th & 8th still hope don't give up. At least see if any help if your precious Mum eats 2 TBL of organic coconut oil 3x a day spread out 8 hours as helps with brain health mix with veg& silica water
9709 2018-02-12 00:59:45 coco butter & coconut oil is life .
9710 2018-02-12 00:59:29 just remembered i drunk ordered CBD oil to fix my anxiety and then got anxious
9711 2018-02-12 00:59:13 わかる、わかるわ～！私も育ちがイイ訳じゃないけど、FF外から「お前さぁ！」「アンタね！」ってリプ来ると、「この人たちの親の顔見て・・・いや、違うこの人たちはヒトでないものに育てられたんだ」って思うことにしてる。
9712 2018-02-12 00:59:11 I can't take it anymore, I need to come clean. I never actually buy olive oil, I just use whoevers I'm living with and the guilt is eating me alive.
9713 2018-02-12 00:59:11 It's been a while since my rear seats have seen any action and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
9714 2018-02-12 00:59:06 Never forget, WI, that Walker TURNED DOWN federal money for high-speed rail.  Imagine what that would have done for our economy...for decades to come. And, it would have saved on energy use.  Why? His paymasters did not want it.  The Kochs sell oil, and Walker sold WI to them.
9715 2018-02-12 00:59:03 I’m not talking about 50 years from now either, and EVs don’t cost twice as much as gasoline cars. After incentives, they barely cost more. And that’s before considering the savings on oil changes, transmission maintenance, gasoline, and all those engine parts.
9716 2018-02-12 00:58:58 Good job Matt and Dickie!!
9717 2018-02-12 00:58:50 Coconut oil shorty
9718 2018-02-12 00:58:42 Houston is 30 years behind in the need for commuter transportation solutions.  Big oil has a lot to do with problem.
9719 2018-02-12 00:58:36 Aku tu cleansing ga cuman double.

9720 2018-02-12 00:58:34 this new beard oil high key excites me
9721 2018-02-12 00:58:19 I accidentally got a bit of mint oil in my eye, (and successfully got it out), but also I think I can see fairies now.
9722 2018-02-12 00:58:17 Yaaaaas
9723 2018-02-12 00:58:08 If you have trouble sleeping, try using L-theanine, valerian root or my favorite CBD oil! Instead of using melatonin or any other synthetic product !
#cbd #cbdoil #health #wellness #natural
9724 2018-02-12 00:57:46 Again, one has nothing to do with the other.
9725 2018-02-12 00:57:21 Also apply some of this special snake oil… it's only $199 a bottle…
9726 2018-02-12 00:57:20 Might as well work on the Oil field for Daddy
9727 2018-02-12 00:57:17 Like, this new lotion from @DrTeals? Avocado essential oil? Sooo soft and smooth...
9728 2018-02-12 00:57:15 Iran is thought to have the third largest oil reserves in the world but remains poor due to geographic and economic reasons. With proper management, easier route and better economic sanctions, the country could quickly modernize.
9729 2018-02-12 00:57:15 This weekend I completed a jigsaw puzzle and researched extra virgin olive oil infused with garlic. I'm 41.
9730 2018-02-12 00:57:10 Comparing the value of items really frustrates me. Like I could buy a vile of completely organic full spectrum CBD oil, or a pair of leggings for $43. What.
9731 2018-02-12 00:57:07 I’ve got 15 fucking acres of land and not one of them has an oil reserve for me to get rich off of
9732 2018-02-12 00:56:27 A bull is on my menu  most of the time in some form or the other..mostly medium rare..and of course with 'magic' mushrooms on the side..by the way I just eat 1 meal a day.:)
9733 2018-02-12 00:56:16 Of course he does.  He is 100% CORRUPT and in the pocket of the oil elite.  He must go.  If I was the next president (thank God I’m not), he’d be the one guys I’d personally fire.  In public.
9734 2018-02-12 00:55:53 I didn’t know they had growth oil. I’m debating cause folks here don’t know how to use their own stuff lol
9735 2018-02-12 00:55:49 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
9736 2018-02-12 00:55:37 The coolant systems here are kerosene and an oil/water mix, plus the oil on everything, and the oil mist in the air, fires are pretty common but usually containable. The power getting knocked out during operation is the big problem, hot metal cobbling & machines eating themselves
9737 2018-02-12 00:55:33 The US is actually selling oil back to Canada they purchased from us at discounted price..
9738 2018-02-12 00:55:29 Cigarettes and weed better oil to move the wheels of state.
9739 2018-02-12 00:55:27 Plus size clothing, sunglasses, oil pen, foundation, a pink bowl for the grinder. Omg yaaaas. 
9740 2018-02-12 00:55:26 Very possible but we shall see
9741 2018-02-12 00:55:23 tip of the day: make some brownies but instead of using vegetable oil replace it with blood orange olive oil it’ll change your whole entire life
9742 2018-02-12 00:55:22 Cut out all dairy products to stop acne. To clear your skin fast; drink water, use lemon & witch hazel to lighten dark marks, use Tea tree oil as a moisturizer, & Exfoliate once a week.
9743 2018-02-12 00:55:19 FUCK yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9744 2018-02-12 00:54:53 Thank you, #LissaLucas for standing up against big oil & power & the bought politicians  in #WestVirginia 
A true Patriot. #TheResistance
9745 2018-02-12 00:54:36 If your neighborhood transformer was the old type that contained oil (with lots of PCBs) anything parked under it (and hence coated in the oil) is toast, as in consider it "totaled". Might be worth checking in it's 1970s era transformer, just in case.
9746 2018-02-12 00:54:35 "What ever you do, do everything for the glory of God." Hypocrite you can't even allow a country the right to self determination and respect their people's choice to choose as sobering independent nation with a democratically elected president # Venezuela. All for oil hunger
9747 2018-02-12 00:54:30 it is so stiff so i use cooking oil
9748 2018-02-12 00:54:27 i recognize this makes me sound like a full-blown hippie but i use rosehip oil at night (not during the day because it has an orange tinge), emulsify it with water on my hands, then cover all that shit with vaseline to seal it all in. works wonders on combo skin
9749 2018-02-12 00:54:15 まるで教科書のような付け入る隙の無さ…
9750 2018-02-12 00:54:15 Coconut oil is the cure to almost everything
9751 2018-02-12 00:54:00 I really need to find a cream or oil to get rid dark spots like my skin is clear I just have hella dark spots now.
9752 2018-02-12 00:53:54 I will say at least one of the #UraniumOne #U1 Rosatom execs was on that Russian plane today. CFO of their overseas subsidiary. Another Russian oil man was as well and looks like an American from Ohio who may have Ukraine ties.
9753 2018-02-12 00:53:47 Oil losing to rising interest rates atm. Govt and corporate debt at all-time highs because of cheap credit. Bears will have it as long as $TNX over 2.75. #OOTT
9754 2018-02-12 00:53:34 If you know what bio oil is, use it on the scar twice a day every day it will help it heal and turn white quicker
9755 2018-02-12 00:53:32 Yeah! He uses my regular old Hada Labo cleansing oil.
9756 2018-02-12 00:53:30 “never forget that time I got peppermint oil on my nipples. That fuckin changed me”
9757 2018-02-12 00:53:15 I cannot love @mydrunkelephant Babyfacial and marula oil enough. So good. #drunkinlove
9758 2018-02-12 00:53:05 ooh a sandalwood scented beard oil. i’m gonna feel fancy
9759 2018-02-12 00:52:51 What you say about China is true and now they know which is why they are going green. But mostly because they have no choice. Mmm good oil...
9760 2018-02-12 00:52:28 I do think #Stocks $ES_F will overall “bounce back” over next couple weeks. But- I agree w/ you Guy, it’s going to be choppy! Trying to diversify w/ some non VIX related products like #Copper $HG_F & #Oil $CL_F which were beat up big just as much if not more than Market lately...
9761 2018-02-12 00:52:28 I told my grandma I have a ear infection... she told me to use castor oil
9762 2018-02-12 00:52:27 @LucasRacingTV watching Lucas oil TV for first time from Richland MS ...Awesome....
9763 2018-02-12 00:52:09 I want to bake brownies but that means I have to walk to cvs to get vegetable oil and it’s 16 degrees. Do you see my dilemma?
9764 2018-02-12 00:51:51 That's awesome. Make sure you get him under the semi when you change oil next time and hand him the grease gun. 
9765 2018-02-12 00:51:39 One of the goals 4 this admin was 2 dismantle any agency or program dedicated 2 alternative energy/fuel. He's a climate change naysayer, n his big donors come from big oil/coal $, so I knew that solar would b targeted. I'm very upset since we were hoping 2 do more of it, soon.
9766 2018-02-12 00:51:39 As expected sure. We know Nurse has stepped up (need to see more). Klefbom has been beyond terrible even using the lowest expectations.  I don’t like the odds or Sekera returning to 5.5M per form moving forward.
9767 2018-02-12 00:51:39 Standard Oil! Just need a Pegasus!

9769 2018-02-12 00:51:32 We pass Graygarden, a sesomeoneement full of armchair infection control experts, and the other 11 oil and gas clients. Okay hold on. Sure.
9770 2018-02-12 00:51:26 I said they are "going" off. Not that they are off oil, but they will be...I never said anything about them exporting oil. 

These are perspecteves, these and much more ARE happening. 

And what about china?
9771 2018-02-12 00:51:12 Congratulations Matt!  The green & yellow hats look great on you!! 
9772 2018-02-12 00:51:11 Japan was largely capitalistic using imperialistic means to spread private industry and invading China, Korea, and South China sea for oil and steel resources. They took the British/ American model and put it on steroids with extreme nationalism and racism, i.e. fascism.

9779 2018-02-12 00:49:57 Dough. Simple enough. Rolled out.
 Filled with sauce, cheese, meat. Sealed. Brushed with oil and slightly seasoned. 375 for about 45 minutes. Don't forget to poke holes with a fork first
9780 2018-02-12 00:49:48 Baby oil and sweat I'm assuming lol
9781 2018-02-12 00:49:35 Good morning! Dr. Esquejo day today. Follow up for botox. 
9782 2018-02-12 00:49:24 My oil diffuser is the best thing I spent my own money on. 
9783 2018-02-12 00:49:24 They didn't mention employing children here. Other juridictions do it to great economic effect. You gotta think outside of the box if you want to keep industry, especially oil, since ours is way more expensive to produce. Maybe that's the nugget that they're waiting for.
9784 2018-02-12 00:49:05 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
9785 2018-02-12 00:48:56 Old man said “Baby I have oil money”
9786 2018-02-12 00:48:55 I /might/ have put too much jasmine oil in my diffuser.
9787 2018-02-12 00:48:53 @DrGundry The Plant Paradox is a great book! 3 Questions: You recommend Kirkland Pesto. But, I was surprised to see Sunflower Oil in it. Is that bad? Also, is Manuka Raw Honey safe to use?  And why is Coconut water bad? Thank you!
9788 2018-02-12 00:48:46 Anything i can do to help? Wag lang problemang dentistry. Haha!
9789 2018-02-12 00:48:17 omg PLEASE do. i would oil cleanse in the shower w avocado oil & i feel like i can skip that whole process w these soaps.
9790 2018-02-12 00:48:13 When does bidding end? Can’t seem to find the answer...
9791 2018-02-12 00:48:10 Oh my. Did the poor guy oil up for Mike?
9792 2018-02-12 00:48:04 when dorothy and the scarecrow meet the tinman in wizard of oz but but instead of "oil" he says dick
9793 2018-02-12 00:47:57 Most of our imported oil comes from America. Saudi Arabia exports about the same amount as Algeria does.  So I'm not sure how "dependant" we are on Saudi Arabia.
9794 2018-02-12 00:47:49 We support our premier's effort to have Kinder Morgan built. It makes sense. Other countries are selling their oil resources. It does not make economic sense to restrict the Alberta oil given what it did on environmental policy.
9795 2018-02-12 00:47:42 Congrats @Air_Doug @TeamKalitta on winning the @NHRA @Lucas_oil #Winternats #KalittaStrong
9796 2018-02-12 00:47:38 It's like we're addicted to war, oil, opium, and greedily lie to ourselves like it's totally not our worst moment, yet...
9797 2018-02-12 00:47:04 Whenever I get upset, I usually have positive thoughts in the back of my head to keep me going. Which shows how far I've come :)

9800 2018-02-12 00:46:31 I need Olbas Oil 
9801 2018-02-12 00:46:21 Right? Like...is it in oil? Water? Dried? WHAT? HOW? My mum is messaging me like "Try it, you might like it." She said that about trifle. NEVER HAVE.
9802 2018-02-12 00:46:20 I use coconut oil! Not a lot though, put some on your fingers and rub your hands, lightly work in into your hair when it’s dry. I also use some mousse that’s doesn’t give too much of a tight hold, and I scrunch it when it’s damp :)
9803 2018-02-12 00:46:17 I’m going to attempt to make lotion bars today. I made the coffee infused almond oil yesterday. Hope they turn out!
9804 2018-02-12 00:46:15 LOL Graham, you say the funniest things. Of course the Israeli Mafia-run government with direct ties to Washington & Hollywood want desperately to pipeline oil as well as arms, drugs, slaves, organs and terrorism to the rest of the planet! 
9805 2018-02-12 00:46:04 Kinda nervous about my massage later. Last time I pretty much paid to get lightly rubbed with oil by a Chinese mom.
9806 2018-02-12 00:45:50 @TreMelvin What are your thoughts on a mother using petroleum jelly & coconut oil in her daughter's hair ?.
9807 2018-02-12 00:45:32 Farinata
--Whisk 2 cups chickpea flour in 3 cups of cold water; add 1 tsp salt, black pepper, 3 tbsp olive oil, pinch turmeric, splash lemon juice
--let sit one hour, covered
--grease & preheat pan in 350-degree oven 10 min.
--pour in mixture, bake 1 hour
--cool 20 minutes
9808 2018-02-12 00:45:21 2nd to achieve it, behind @DonPrudhomme #Winternats
9809 2018-02-12 00:45:17 my sister gave me a bottle of canola oil & told me to chug it  wow she hates me lmfaooo
9810 2018-02-12 00:45:11 i think you might like Ere Perez sold in health stores. The almond oil mascara smells divine 
9811 2018-02-12 00:45:07 So I roasted veggies in safflower oil, cumin, cayenne, and curry then combined them w a jalfrezi simmer sauce (Palak’s brand) from Patel Bros. Served over basmati.
9812 2018-02-12 00:45:00 Are you for real? Serious question. There are so many @realDonaldTrump loving bots out there. Anyway, the world is laughing at us. Obama was a statesman, Trump is a snake oil salesman, and a sh!tty one at that.
9813 2018-02-12 00:44:44 Dear @pepboysauto I got an oil change with you recently. I will never be back simply because you spam my email like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. For fuck sakes.....I’ll be back when I need something. Back the fuck off.
9814 2018-02-12 00:44:33 Got the salt lamp on, oil diffuser, and lava lamp. So relaxing
9815 2018-02-12 00:44:01 Your “graph” is worthless if it doesnt consider where the oil is used. #California (high tech w/good EPA) - can be counted on to count emissions honestly + transport waste is low if its used where extracted.

Theyre not exporting it so barely affects global markets.

9816 2018-02-12 00:43:53 Transmutation:

•Grapes must be
crushed to make wine

•Diamonds form
under pressure

•Olives are pressed to
release oil

•Seeds grow in
darkness

Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed, or in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation/transmutation.
9817 2018-02-12 00:43:37 To clean paint off your hands, use olive oil - it softens the paint and makes it easy to remove.

9820 2018-02-12 00:43:15 I just want a full body rub down w oil from daddy
9821 2018-02-12 00:43:09 น้องง่วงง เราควรจะได้ตื่นสาย
9822 2018-02-12 00:42:40 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
9823 2018-02-12 00:42:39 Do the marijuana oil vape pens show up on drug tests????

9825 2018-02-12 00:42:16 People,Do not buy any Gram products. They are cheap. Like , the oil filter. The filter ic around 3 to 4 feet ,less.The spring is not a spring. They just use cheap glue on the top and bottom. It is a cheap filter. All they won,t is your money. They are cheap.

9827 2018-02-12 00:41:32 Might as well call Prostock what it really is, Pro Chevy. Should just rename the class.
9828 2018-02-12 00:41:28 it’s oil but it’s definitely not CBD 
9829 2018-02-12 00:41:17 Ooh yeah try it! I dabbed the oil using a q-tip and left it on for an hour or so.
9830 2018-02-12 00:40:50 ugh. I gotta get an oil change tomorrow.
9831 2018-02-12 00:40:46 they're handmade soaps and made with only olive oil and an essential oil for smell and lye water. Amazing. I need to find a site where I can buy more. I will put you on too
9832 2018-02-12 00:40:41 I’m constantly putting coconut oil and tea tree oil on my nails and my skin but I still need prednisone.
9833 2018-02-12 00:40:40 Do you have the drug laced CBD oil too?
9834 2018-02-12 00:40:32 Need some Castor oil

9840 2018-02-12 00:39:51 yall mind if i

change my oil
9841 2018-02-12 00:39:51 My band (Snake Oil) is writing music for a cool NPR segment-type show (that makes me cry every week) that I'm not sure I'm allowed to talk about, but I'm not sure why I wouldn't be allowed to talk about it... Adding this to the pile of stuff to work on this week...
9842 2018-02-12 00:39:43 And on the other end of the extreme, Venezuela has crypto-oil-coin.. digging deeper into the sinkhole
9843 2018-02-12 00:39:10 Nope. Also many companies have pulled out of the oil sands as well because it's too expensive for them to have anymore. It's not economically viable.
9844 2018-02-12 00:39:05 But we cannot get to the point we think all ppl are snake oil salesmen.  

I wish good and kind were innate human qualities and deciphering was not required.
9845 2018-02-12 00:38:54 Fun story.  Crap weather today so I decide to mink oil three pairs of @blundstones. Went out to meet some local community leaders for conversation and engagement. Came home and Hamish has de-mink oiled two pairs of Blundstones that were drying. When will I ever learn? 

#dogdad
9846 2018-02-12 00:38:46 Doing the same in my head I had a vision of my red hair looking golden blonde reality was a haystack on my head lots of coconut oil and trims x
9847 2018-02-12 00:38:27 Except there is the other regressive taxes and the fact we won’t get 7% on the wells when they are actually producing. The oil industry is actively bragging this will keep their taxes the lowest. This does nothing to improve education nor teacher pay. $200 more pre-tax isn’t much
9848 2018-02-12 00:38:19 Narrative seriese #3 for the week of 2/12 - 2/16 
1. #Crude oil inventory builds continue to accelerate
2. #Shale oil is in spotlight and breaking new records with rig #s
3. Saudi and Russians talk to prop up sagging #crude prices
4. MiddleEast tensions & effects on #crude #OOTT
9849 2018-02-12 00:38:16 Sent a report.  FWIW hubby doesn't think brake line is related to oil change.  Just odd that no one noticed brake pedal almost going to the floor when bringing it outside.  Still not sure they did lube, it said "completed, zero fittings"
9850 2018-02-12 00:37:54 Put Tea Tree Oil & Coconut Oil On Entire Life
9851 2018-02-12 00:37:54 I sampled beard oil today knowing damn well I have to shave every day
9852 2018-02-12 00:37:49 cbd oil
9853 2018-02-12 00:37:48 Only if you like maltodextrin, soybean oil and hydrogenated oil in your peanut butter
9854 2018-02-12 00:37:30 Mercedes are for middle and upper middle class you dolt. Haven’t heard of Tesla Model 3, eh? You thinking oil is the future is…depressing
9855 2018-02-12 00:37:29 If no #dilbit is available to undercut less damaging oil, oil price remains high enough to drive shift to efficient transport & heating.  Exactly what #bigoil doesnt want since waste=sales to them.

So the replacement for #dilbit not shipped is efficient devices - not other oil.
9856 2018-02-12 00:37:27 No problem! If you have active acne a natural remedy is Tea Tree oil+ peppermint oil+ vitamin e oil! Works well at night before bed. Do it daily as needed to reduce acne! And the other treatments for hyperpigmentstion and scarring!
9857 2018-02-12 00:36:57 In the oven abt 450, olive oil, spices, and a curry mix, 15-20mins
9858 2018-02-12 00:36:52 In constant pain from #DryEye and #Blepharitis (often feeling like acid in eyes while lids pinched and pulled off) have no patience with snake oil optometrists and ophthalmologists who see folks like me as opportunity for their profit centre.
9859 2018-02-12 00:36:49 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
9860 2018-02-12 00:36:48 If snake oil...
9861 2018-02-12 00:36:46 U said British petroleum is américain? Just 2 hours after the iraqy atu attack and Iranian backed, BP is entered in kirkouk went to oil! It was the same in 1926. The 688 resolution of security council was a French project!
All UK did is gave our land to others 4  petrol 
9862 2018-02-12 00:36:35 @BoKnowsRacing all the way #WinterNats
9863 2018-02-12 00:36:34 I didn't say that but did want to address your sarcasm with some truth and facts. No one said anything about employing children either. Reality is Canada uses oil. Destroying its own industry does more harm than good and will delay the dream you have for tomorrow with debt.
9864 2018-02-12 00:36:26 I think this might be an argan fruit tree where they get argan oil from. The goats love the tasty fruits and climb up into the trees to get them!
9865 2018-02-12 00:35:46 ...because we want their oil. Or something. It's an argument that seems to rely upon his perception of the world rather than empirical evidence. He's...ah whatever. What does he care what I ruddy think haha
9866 2018-02-12 00:35:39 Those 9 can stop Step Up. The problem is that we need to undo the tax break we gave to the oil industry. Do you really think the plan they back is actually a good thing or the best we can do? We can and should demand better.
9867 2018-02-12 00:35:26 Pretty sure running it without oil is worse.  Try both and let me know.
9868 2018-02-12 00:35:16 " I try not to buy my tuna from the same place I buy motor oil!"  Hilarious!  #POstables

9877 2018-02-12 00:33:29 For soup, cook sliced leek in oil, then simmer with meatballs, cayenne, beef broth and celery. Top with lime juice.

9889 2018-02-12 00:31:49 @RachelNotley @jjhorgan from Oliver, BC "Wine Capital of Canada", I support Canadian industry, get the pipeline built.  Let's have Albertans celebrate with a bottle of BC wine.  Many people in this area benefit from Oil and Gas industry.  Increase efficiency, reduce oil imports.

9892 2018-02-12 00:31:41 You are advance #genocide by false equivalence. 

1. USA is exporting light sweet crude as its own oil use drops. Exports LNG to displace #coal in #China.

2. Norway exports light crude & gas, doesnt leave $2T liability in dead habitat either.

3. Same argument used re #slavery
9893 2018-02-12 00:31:38 i forgot to put oil on the pan so my brownies wouldn’t stick 
9894 2018-02-12 00:31:37 I think it is imp to keep an open mind. In my opinion, demand for oil will decrease no matter what. Mind set of citizens changing. We're downsizing, sharing and buying less. All of this means a shift from oil consumption. Even if this is propoganda why not note that FN want jobs?
9895 2018-02-12 00:31:14 No, but I'm sure the Venezuelan oil is a perfect fit for EXXON! US DEMOCRACY IS COMING!
9896 2018-02-12 00:31:09 OIL PAINTINGS OIL PAINTINGS
9897 2018-02-12 00:30:58 I've done exactly 1 oil painting in my life. Idk if this is acrylic or oil, but I know it takes a shit-ton of time and supplies. Considering the size, I'd agree that $150-200 could be a starting price, but even that feels low depending on how long it takes/size/supply fees.
9898 2018-02-12 00:30:54 Are ALL Lucas races on Lucas oil tv??..Thanks!
9899 2018-02-12 00:30:17 Retail here. Got in July, went with oil. Converted to cash before sell-off cept for an MLP(-3%) Only, I didn't have shorts set as I meant to (Ooops) Now I ask: now what?

9904 2018-02-12 00:29:19 OIL!
9905 2018-02-12 00:29:12 I think it is important for all of us to think about the benefits of the oil industry and see if the industry will improve employment of FN folks who want this business. I am willing to think and hold opposing views in head such as FN folks who want good env record and oil jobs
9906 2018-02-12 00:28:57 oh omg I thought it was but uhhhh still yikes cause depending on the castor oil you have it smells nasty

Insinuating oil workers are rapists isn't making us like her
9910 2018-02-12 00:28:00 You talk about Up Stream/ Down Stream with no action on Saudi oil tankers pumping unethical oil into Montreal. BC striping mountains away for China bound Coal. Que Liberals were the ones who sunk Billions into the Asbestos industry. You are the Damage to our childrens future.

9913 2018-02-12 00:27:24 ...The US bribes more brutal dictatorships for oil than North Korea. The US funds more conflicts between nations than North Korea. The US blockades more countries from their own territorial waters and fishing areas than North Korea. The US creates more refugees than North Korea.

9923 2018-02-12 00:25:47 You might add that this was after he became rich by helping Comrade Stalin develop his oil reserves. Such an upstanding chap, as are his offspring. I give William F Buckley Jr a lot of credit for keeping them out of the conservative movement.
9924 2018-02-12 00:25:24 this cat wouldn't know who @AGSchneiderman is if not for bad oil industry promoted tweeets
9925 2018-02-12 00:25:24 We have no legitimate reason to want to topple Assad. But Israel wants to grab a piece of Syria, rich in oil. And as it controls Congress, the White House and the Media, it is using us. So are the Saudis.

9927 2018-02-12 00:25:03 More lies. The US could have easily prevented war by lifting the oil embargo and working with Japan to exploit SE Asia. I'm not saying this ultimately would have been better for people only that it wouldn't have been a lie.
9928 2018-02-12 00:24:58 My boyfriend got me a oil diffuser and I’m so excited to use it 
9929 2018-02-12 00:24:56 ok there’s no heating in my house and my whole family are currently in the sitting room because the fire is lit and my mother has suggested not buying more oil because she likes us all here together in the one room, SOS, I need heat
9930 2018-02-12 00:24:19 We can say they don't, because we're phasing out oil, Right?!?  British Columbia certainly doesn't need one!!!
9931 2018-02-12 00:23:54 It's sad to see so many people on Facebook live bootlegging the Lucas Oil TV broadcast. A service that I pay for, it's not fair when it all of a sudden goes away because people weren't supporting it. Support the SPORT!
9932 2018-02-12 00:23:27 I had high hopes for this class but here I am having to force myself to write a critical analysis about European nude oil paintings. I can't believe I pay money to be put through this. 
9933 2018-02-12 00:23:19 Control is right - coal and oil Barron’s want to control all energy, regulations and profit. Renewables threaten that with diversity and distributed generation.
9934 2018-02-12 00:23:19 Read "Frugal Innovation" by Navi Radjou and Jaideep Prabhu. We're all going to be doing innovation cheaply and as small business owners. Then the nesting business even in Japan. The world is changing; the oil industry is not. Should "look in the mirror" as per the PCs we booted.
9935 2018-02-12 00:23:14 I have never spent one dime on an Accord for fixing anything.  Change the oil,  ( I'm a freak about that), tires and brake maintenance.  They just don't have any issues.  Ever.
9936 2018-02-12 00:23:07 People of vision are passing the ostriches of big oil and government. Renewable are showing the way to a cheap and safer future and leaving the dinosaurs of fossil fuels in the dust where they belong.
9937 2018-02-12 00:23:02 Vegetable oil is so bad for you
9938 2018-02-12 00:22:55 SENATOR THAT WAY THEY WILL CONTINUE AND NOT GO UNDER ;THIS CHANGE WILL BE FOR COUNTLESS THOUSANDS OF YEARS! IN SAY A CENTURY OIL WITH POPULATION WILL BE DEPLETED!
9939 2018-02-12 00:22:43 Oil spill hair?
9940 2018-02-12 00:22:37 Not sure what your macro breakdown looks like but a good quality olive oil over everything helps. Shakes with peanut butter added can help too, or other ways of drinking calories.
9941 2018-02-12 00:22:23 It's alright Belmo, we all got our ups and downs. I was practicing on an oil pattern I'm going to use in my school tournament and I couldn't even break a 200.  I hope to be bowling with you one day man !!!
9942 2018-02-12 00:22:20 It's a can of worms... so to remain completely unbiased we need the equivalent data for the ICE side... That would be emissions from oil exploration, extraction, transportation, refining, distribution... Have you a list of studies for that?
9943 2018-02-12 00:22:07 I went to my friends flat the other day and they cook with olive oil but it wasn’t extra virgin so I’m #extraconfused
9944 2018-02-12 00:22:07 Why? Many many people benefit from cheap energy. Do you drive a car? Do you fly to Mexico or across the country occasionally? Do you eat? Then you too drive oil demand. No demand would mean no supply. Oil industry merely supplies what customers demand at 1000 barrels a second !!
9945 2018-02-12 00:22:06 NO. There is nothing beautiful about being goth. I'm a fan of cultural appropriation tho. If white ppl wanna use coconut oil for their hair, they should feel free to do so.
9946 2018-02-12 00:22:04 Just thickly sliced cauliflower cooked with salt, pepper and olive oil. Tasty!
9947 2018-02-12 00:22:04 Not sure why you’re breaking out but I have acne prone skin and use organic pure joboba oil + 100% pure aloe Vera gel to moisturize and no issues 
9948 2018-02-12 00:21:49 Coconut oil has saved my skin
9949 2018-02-12 00:21:45 I have used 2% milk, self rising flour, butter crisco, black flat skillet for years. Pour crisco oil in bottom and flip biscuit over after coating it. 475 degrees for 12-14 min. Key is the skillet. Don’t over knead the dough.
9950 2018-02-12 00:21:25 Baby oil gel and Coconut Oil is such a blessing for your body 
9951 2018-02-12 00:21:01 Nonsense. That is sheep talk. Oil is going nowhere. It has and always will be subsidized. Start making the panels in the US. Americans will buy them. Risks is part of life. Success cannot happen without risks.
9952 2018-02-12 00:20:53 WE CAN USE THE PROFITS CREATED FROM RENEWABLE TO PAY OFF DEFICIT! IF WE.EVEN INCREASE 5% YEARLY THE OIL INDUSTRY SUCH EXXON AND MOBIL CAN TAKE CHARGE IN THAT CHANGE !GIVE THEM SUBSIDIES AND TAX WRITE OFFS IN RENEWABLES IN 20 YEARS PROBLEMS SOLVED!
9953 2018-02-12 00:20:49 Ridiculous comparison. Tar sands oil is bitumen sand made liquid for pipeline with toxic benzene that vaporizes to a carcinogenic has There is no known technology to clean up a spill & coal doesnt contaminate oceans or groundwater
9954 2018-02-12 00:20:42 The words of the elephant before a Sunday night feast with my family. Just ate a cream of turkey, and now I await a burger with fries. This feast is glorious. I wonder what your families are eating......roasted bull :)

9963 2018-02-12 00:19:03 There's various types of oil that can be used to make gasoline.
9964 2018-02-12 00:18:58 (#^-^)ﾒﾗ…ﾒﾗ…
9965 2018-02-12 00:18:56 Yes.  And it's MUCH more than just election hacking..... NATO/EU.  Baltics.  Oil.  Middle East.  Quid pro quo.  And Trump owes Boris and Natasha BIGLY.
9966 2018-02-12 00:18:52 If you're going to buy and use essential oils you NEED to dilute them. Add them to your lotion, mix with your bath water, put in an oil diffuser. Using concentrated essential oils on your skin can burn you. Even if you're not allergic you can have a reaction to it's concentrate.
9967 2018-02-12 00:18:50 Great article with good points about Arctic governance and how it is unique in the Arctic. The potential opening of ANWR to exploration is problematic and I would expect Russia to pursue it's oil and gas interests.

9968 2018-02-12 00:18:18 - cooking oil in followed by the beef.

"Heh, we'll see."

Why was he hiding it? It was obviously stew.
9969 2018-02-12 00:18:04 tea tree oil so mf expensive I just wanna have beautiful skin already
9970 2018-02-12 00:18:00 We’ve run out of oil so now we have no heating and it’s like the fucking Antarctic in this house 
9971 2018-02-12 00:17:57 Ahh so you're ignorant to this topic.
No one vehicle does nothing, neither does all the oil companies in the world. Climate change is a natural process
9972 2018-02-12 00:17:57 Of course they're assuming nationalizing something is some sort of a priori sin in the first place. Don't look at the successful, developed western nations that nationalize things such as oil (*cough* Scandinavian countries) for the greater good.
9973 2018-02-12 00:17:46 Exactly. What do you think the other teams in the NHL are doing now?
9974 2018-02-12 00:17:39 I'm almost 100% certain he gets an Invite to the WC.Its best the Oilers tell him to decline.
9975 2018-02-12 00:17:38 If republicans weren’t blocking the fair competition of selling Teslas to help their oil sugar daddies, Teslas would be everywhere already
9976 2018-02-12 00:17:35 you're allowed to be whatever you want :D
I'm still waiting for the highres of "oh fuck there's a pint of gear oil in my hair" :D
9977 2018-02-12 00:17:35 Recipe of the day. Bacon wrapped asparagus. Sprinkle sea salt olive oil and a little bit of pepper. Wrap 3-6 asparagus in 1 piece of bacon (I used 2) put in oven at 400 degrees for approximately 15 minutes. You're welcome
9978 2018-02-12 00:17:30 I truly believe that there are no RUS sanctions, cause they have been promised stakes in the half trillion dollars Rosneft oil fields
9979 2018-02-12 00:17:20 I only use main choice conditioner and growth oil! I’m natural so i rarely use shampoo unless I’m taking down box braids or something.
9980 2018-02-12 00:17:01 風邪かな？風邪か？ってなってたけどこれなにーーーー
9981 2018-02-12 00:16:13 @balboaislandca Wow..I was just at Olive Oil & Beyond on Balboa Island and the owner just kicked my wife out. He said she didn’t look like a legitimate customer.
9982 2018-02-12 00:15:55 Yup. Flash got us a snake oil salesman & a dismantled team. Maturity & respect got us a SB champion.
9983 2018-02-12 00:15:42 la amenaza del peak oil se cierne sobre nuestra vida otra vez, tomaremos por fin los coches que funcionan con agua o esperaremos al colapso global?
9984 2018-02-12 00:15:39 So folks out here putting coconut oil + Vaseline(on an infant scalp), length checking (on an infant scalp), worried about edges (on an infant scalp),& making their baby sleep on their stomach to avoid bald spots, thereby increasing the risk of SIDS (bc hair growth)?

Priorities.

9989 2018-02-12 00:14:44 If I put dishwashing liquid in my hair it should be all out by the end of the day lol. Good thing I have lots of coconut oil
9990 2018-02-12 00:14:43 A little bit of organic sweet almond oil!
9991 2018-02-12 00:14:21 I tried my hand at fancy living once. Went to this place called "The Fresh Market" and I was so excited. Then I went to the oil aisle and realized they were selling $100 olive oil. I left the store wit one pork chop. One.
9992 2018-02-12 00:14:06 I do not understand your logic. B/c govmnts gives subsidies (little to new tech and A LOT to oil) they are therefore owned by said govmt?

9995 2018-02-12 00:13:23 These bots are getting an oil change for not putting tunes out professional, properly BCC'd promo email referencing my head
9996 2018-02-12 00:13:17 They may sound like a dying whale, but at least our engines aren't built to fall apart–.

The average lifespan of a chevy motor has dwindled severely, and they require like

2 pints of oil a week, with the Silverado.

That's why I'm shitting on GM-

10001 2018-02-12 00:12:39 “John Shott. First Energy $2,000. Appalachian Power $2,000. Steptoe & Johnson—that’s a gas & oil law firm—$2,000. Consol Energy $1,000. EQT $1,000. I could go on," Lucas said. Lucas disobeyed & went on to list out oil & gas campaign donations given to Delegate Jason Harshbarger."

10003 2018-02-12 00:12:04 I love rose oil it's such a treat!
10004 2018-02-12 00:11:47 I don't know.  I'm going to drop the coconut oil and go with grass fed butter and see how it goes.
10005 2018-02-12 00:11:43 ALL democrats should be proactive instead of reactive. Republicans are using Russian bots & the media to benefit their party. Dems need to dominate every form of media. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. Too many dems are making a few of their peers carry the whole load.

10007 2018-02-12 00:11:36 The only thing stupider than coconut oil on the face in the skin care community is thinking that a 60 dollar rose water face mist is doing shit all besides makin u look foolish
10008 2018-02-12 00:11:29 Honestly this has been such a good Sunday. Made breakfast, ate salmon for lunch, worked out, now I’m doing a coconut oil hair treatment. Self love Sunday 
10009 2018-02-12 00:11:26 Don’t do this, just get out the olive oil and saturate
10010 2018-02-12 00:11:17 While you were distracted by Trump's tweets, Vladimir Putin allowed oil drilling in an innocent pineapple. But her emails!
10011 2018-02-12 00:11:16 your going to compliment her oil filter ??
10012 2018-02-12 00:11:08 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
10013 2018-02-12 00:11:03 They’re probably taking loads of fish oil. 

When did we get old ...
10014 2018-02-12 00:10:51 Then what do I do?? No money for cbd oil or anything insurance won't pay. It's a vicious cycle. I can't afford vitamins, nothing. The govt likes to keep us down...  Being poor sucks.
