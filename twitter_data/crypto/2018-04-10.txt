41 2018-04-10 23:56:59 Nearly all literate men cheer for women. That simply isn't the problem. The problem is the fake feminists that allege rape where none exists, promote gender stereotypes, and confuse well-intentioned men into promoting these agendas as well.

55 2018-04-10 23:55:22 To be fair there's coins everywhere that are itching to pump, solid projects at ATL's, if not below ICO price.
56 2018-04-10 23:55:11 Take the job from the FBI and give it to the DOD OR DIA, both have crypto analyst with secret, top secret, and ultra clearences. No national security implications should occur. Let's get with it, FBI dosen't want to turn over anything, it will implicate Mueller and Rosenstein.
57 2018-04-10 23:55:10 I know I'm late to the party but Season 2, Episode 1 of Designated Survivor referenced #Bitcoin as a payment used by the lead enemy character. I'm both glad and disappointed by that. Crypto in popular media is good, but reinforcing the stereotype is bad.
58 2018-04-10 23:55:07 I wouldn’t mind being at the bottom of the list ... too much pressure at the top :)

61 2018-04-10 23:55:03 The best time to buy crypto is when media coverage is low, when exposure is big @ReutersWorld @CNN @FoxNews FOMO will apear again and new ATH’s.
62 2018-04-10 23:54:59 An idea for all of us youngsters. If you invest into crypto currency, invest just as much into a long term IRA such as a 401k. You’ll have the fun/risk of crypto mutual funds, while also saving for retirement.
63 2018-04-10 23:54:58 He’s using the tweet to pump his favorite low cap crypto lmao 
64 2018-04-10 23:54:57 even the same tiles, wtf
65 2018-04-10 23:54:43 Only things i can think of, since Bitcoin is clearly breaking the rules of Twitter. 
1. Bitcoin paid off @Twitter to get the name back illegitimately.
2. @Twitter knows the account is damaging the crypto industry and is using it along with add bans to discredit crypto. 
3. BOTH

71 2018-04-10 23:53:58 In macro-terms men are biologically stronger than women. In macro terms They also score higher on IQ tests. Feminists believe women should be treated as people, because promoting stereotypes doesn't let individuals succeed on their own merit.
72 2018-04-10 23:53:45 Maybe it wasn't meant for discussion. May be silly but adheres from my perspective. If I'm wrong I'm ok with that. From an outsider perspective it seems appropriate. I love bitcoin and have for years.

Futures = suppression of price as I see it.

115 2018-04-10 23:48:40 I understand the literature perfectly well. Why are there all male sports teams or anything then? Why is there anyone cheering for a specific country during the World Cup?

119 2018-04-10 23:48:11 Great interview! Although I do disagree with his “#bitcoin is slower to develop than other crypto” comment. Everything that is decentrlized is slow. If your fast to develop, you probably aren’t very decentralized. If you aren’t decentralized, are you as much crypto as you claim?

157 2018-04-10 23:42:44 Don't know if it gets better or you just get more immune...
158 2018-04-10 23:42:37 Léger. Je suis encore novice dans la crypto.
Mais je me renseigne de plus en plus.
Je vais sans doute investir dans les prochains mois.

165 2018-04-10 23:41:41 It was like 100 40 ETH sell orders at staggered prices. But it has gone with the crypto wind
166 2018-04-10 23:41:31 Looking more to late summer, here is $3-5 my feelings. This is one of very few real crypto Projects for business in all crypto.
167 2018-04-10 23:41:28 I will give a better effort next time.
168 2018-04-10 23:41:26 So you criticize crypto, but like blockchain?
169 2018-04-10 23:41:14 Agreed Bitcoin won’t be the world currency if that does occur ;)
170 2018-04-10 23:41:04 Freedom of speech is one thing, but their operations were/are harmful to the crypto community. The fact that they blocked everyone who complained shows they KNOW they are in the wrong and have no shame about it.

190 2018-04-10 23:37:14 As far as 'cultural and systemic biases, based on cognitive schemas, so you get more diverse viewpoints' - I don't think you understand the literature. Assimilation is the efficiency of diversity agendas, when it's actually pursued. The Illiberal-ism of 2017 is fake diversity.

201 2018-04-10 23:35:42 As a feminist, I believe that women are 'people' and not 'all the same'. Espousing the view that women are a pityable class only serves to create more women's chess leagues. It does not promote an outcome where women get to play chess with the professionals.

203 2018-04-10 23:35:18 Same can be said about stocks.  Point he’s making is btc goes by rules not by any arbitrary bureaucracatic process.

262 2018-04-10 23:26:58 It does have a lot of potential, but especially of late it’s all airdrops. Paid in Bitcoin I can handle, but $1 of an ICO token is a waste of time.

264 2018-04-10 23:26:21 Hello everybody  this has been a very emotional/stressfull month but we're coping! Our home caught fire a week ago and the boys and I are staying at grandma's for now. Had to pull out all of my savings including my beloved crypto to survive on what we have now (continues..)
265 2018-04-10 23:25:51 I somewhat agree with you but I keep coming back to this sticking point, "who gives a flying fuck!" As a Crypto Community that's looking to gain mass adoption and acceptance from the world at large we need to stop fighting amongst ourselves...period end of story!
266 2018-04-10 23:25:43 Why don't you do an exclusive on how bothered I am?  I'm here for info and anonymity is more important to me than fake friends.  The crypto gen is enlightened on fake news. You should move into politics or z list celebs.
267 2018-04-10 23:25:26 Because of KYC "security" laws, now a bunch of ICOs, many of which will end up dead and broke, have in their servers a collection of photos of passports and a throve very private information about crypto owners. How's that for "security"?

297 2018-04-10 23:20:13 To use a trend line as a support you will trust better a 4hr bar chart or higher. Otherwise you will get chopped all the time. This might be a trend line used for scalping but definitely not support.

Don't get fooled into selling your $xvg bags. 
Whales are well aware of where price is going in 7 days and laugh everytime they dupe a noob into selling cheap.
Sell your xvg and fomo buy back again in 1 week.

536 2018-04-10 22:46:22 Well, if you guess that a Bitcoin with less value, less adoption, a weaker network, and less decentralization is better... then I guess you’re free to believe whatever you want. But it certainly was cheaper to send with such low usage & adoption.
537 2018-04-10 22:46:13 Well it's a small but interesting thing, latest episode of Billions mentioned #cryptocurrency & #crypto a couple of times. Apparently Wall Street traders love the show along with a few other millions. The context was pretty interesting too.

540 2018-04-10 22:46:00 Someone build a new private Facebook for $5 per year. No ads. We download our data and move it there. It could be a decentralized network. Crypto platform. Have an ICO Just a thought. #Zuckerberg $FB
541 2018-04-10 22:45:55 Tron is not a good coin to invest in,  if you really want to make profit from crypto currency because there are lots of scam going on with the coin. I have count my loses and move on.

552 2018-04-10 22:44:47 Bitcoin is the future currency! People ask me, ‘Are you going to sell your bitcoin?’ Why sell the future for the past? I dont know why anyone would want to go back when crypto is distributed, secure and global, while fiat is subject to the whims of political forces.

553 2018-04-10 22:44:31 DYOR but $FCT is looking like a solid investment TO ME for 2018. It appears like a more stable, reliable crypto to invest in, as it actually is fixing a real life problem.
554 2018-04-10 22:44:22 Crypto Cuh!!!!! 
555 2018-04-10 22:44:09 Who is getting rich in the “Markets?”  

Very few!  

Why is that?  

Because most have no idea how to navigate the “Markets” successfully, right?  

Who benefits from a Crypto-currency that is traded on an “Exchange?”  

The people that own the “Exchange” is the correct answer!

577 2018-04-10 22:40:12 Some people expect to see the #bitcoin hits $2k or $3k, it's still a possibility but the price (not just #btc but #eth #etherum as well) is pretty stable since 2 weeks. I feel like the 250 billions global #crypto #marketcap is here to stay. I think the bear market will ends soon!

- (Newb)orn: knows nothing, is driven by curiosity and eager to learn.

- Toddler: has somewhat matured and begins testing their limits. Only cares about charts and calls.

660 2018-04-10 22:26:49 I think a good example of this can be seen in the Exchanges. Crypto exchanges do things that exchanges for other types of assets never even thought of seriously:

1. Operate 24/7
2. Public APIs
3. Partial shares

686 2018-04-10 22:24:03 Realistic or not, the possibility is there. I think there is a big shift happening right now as crypto matures. It’s about to turn from a rumor driven and highly speculative market to a result based and lagging indicator like stocks. XRP is the place to go in this case.

709 2018-04-10 22:18:49 They are working on a Tier 1 exchange. They will have a Pos stake web service where you can link any pos stake coin wallet online with this service so you can stake your coins without needing your own computer running 24/7 They have parallell masternodes. They are a hybrid model.

Decentralized cryptocurrency protocols are smart contracts with decentralized security, encryption, and limited trusted parties that fit definition of a digital agreement.

723 2018-04-10 22:15:34 @BennettGarner embarrassingly late article on Cryptokitties, it came out more than 3 months ago with a lot of in depth articles published on it.

727 2018-04-10 22:15:19 Buying/Selling crypto in Canada is a big problem. There are limited exchanges, the rates are outrageous, and customer service is dismal. Now, the banks are making it worse. It won't stop me but it will stop many from getting involved in crypto which slows adoption and acceptance.
728 2018-04-10 22:14:53 Definitely more relevant thank frigging Caviar and Crypto or w/e tf you are.
729 2018-04-10 22:14:39 see VB at deconony re: efficiency trade offs. perhaps surprisingly i don’t personally see a future for crypto assets as mainstream currency. SoV maybe.

752 2018-04-10 22:10:40 I've been saying this is what we need to do for a while. Whether it happens or not is another matter. Current gov are totally incompetent so more likely to fuck it up than anything, but the promotion of low reg markets like AIM does set an encouraging precedent.
753 2018-04-10 22:10:39 I’ve been leveraging long eth against btc since about 380USD Bitmex, making a nice profit, will reload this long after the next bottom, could hold for months, 1 eth should be at lease 0.1 btc
754 2018-04-10 22:10:34 Interesting catch. Those devs sitting on the kind of war chest that crypto develop with have a difficult choice to make sooner or later.

783 2018-04-10 22:06:41 Eth/Btc 
784 2018-04-10 22:06:33 No, the main point of the article is that transactions are based on trust, and that the things crypto focuses on to “solve” that don’t actually solve it, and trust is still required in the vast majority of cases. Did you read the whole thing?
785 2018-04-10 22:06:30 some of us thinking this is a money or crypto war but you should really think about it because it became a knowladge war and the truth will be the winner like always.

796 2018-04-10 22:05:16 @TB057 To visually see a crypto coin - you go from the bottom up. I suggested you switch those and work from top down to the smallest data file. This will expand the blockchain instead decrease the amount of space. The bigger the data, the higher the membership status
797 2018-04-10 22:05:14 @Ripple

847 2018-04-10 21:59:12 Kringles are the smallest change of the crypto-currency TBC.  

0.00000001 TBC = 1 Kringle.  

The way you can calculate the conversion of Kringles into TBC is by dividing the Kringles by 100,000,000 to get the TBC equivalent.  100,000 Kringles divided by 100,000,000 = 0.001 TBC.

868 2018-04-10 21:55:28 isogeny volcanoes are slightly different isogeny graphs than the ones used in SIDH, the isogenies are slightly different and can point 'up' and 'down'. The ones that are 'horizontal' are like the ones in regular SIDH graphs.

Some of you said #domaining was dead! You were wrong.

I guess that crypto, mining, token or blockchain project just didn't work out? No surprise there.

#Domains rule the web!

912 2018-04-10 21:47:46 I agree but depends on risk reward and objective. Length of stop is also very important in my opinion. I like 10x= 10% risk. More than most can and should stomach. Also don’t use this on main portfolio.

918 2018-04-10 21:47:26 I'm almost convinced this entire crypto-year will be spent trying to "bore" the market to stagnation. Think about instead of shaking the tree, it simply bores the average trader to death to the point they aren't interested anymore. AND BOOM. $BTC

922 2018-04-10 21:46:17 Hi there, I have 10 years of crypto TA experience
923 2018-04-10 21:46:10 My Twitter account is young so here is what I think. 
I think that They are trying to kill UP FOMO and create DOWN FOMO. They have already killed most of die hard UP FOMO warriors and once they create huge army of DOWN FOMO, Bull run will start again. After that cycle revolves...
924 2018-04-10 21:45:57 Why is everyone bullish again? What did I miss?
925 2018-04-10 21:45:56 I remember last fall when everyone thought the price would tank after BTC got around $10K on low volume. Then it just kept going.
926 2018-04-10 21:45:52 Continues to wedge out and breaks one direction with a vengeance. I say downside. But we will let the market decide what she wants to do.
927 2018-04-10 21:45:50 If you are not at #LendItFintech #lendit #SF you must, just have to find @TimDraper talk on #crypto #bitcoin #FacebookDataBreach absolutely awesome

977 2018-04-10 21:38:48 They have been conditioning us that our kids wont be able to afford a house... Work for a wage mentality = True

In the crypto case:

Our kids will be able to afford the whole block, some will be able to buy the state mine will own an island
978 2018-04-10 21:38:35 I morbidly enjoyed watching “crypto” ( enter name here) explain about Fibonacci Retracements as their cult like followers consumed this “knowledge”  turns out they were just playing everyone in a pump and dump Ponzi scheme ironically pointed out aptly by @wolfofwallst  months ago
979 2018-04-10 21:38:33 If $VEN can get a daily close above 40k sats it should secure a nice uptrend to 51k and beyond.

The team knows how to play the market and will no doubt get some announcements lined up if alts go full bull.
980 2018-04-10 21:38:32 You need some release of the bodily kind man
981 2018-04-10 21:38:25 Starting to wonder if the crypto market has already bottomed. Now, will it go back up, or level off for a bit? I hate establishment manipulation. The people need to make crypto successful on their own
982 2018-04-10 21:38:05 I try to inoculate myself but it requires taking a cheeseburger as a suppository.

1005 2018-04-10 21:34:04 Sometimes crypto investors need to get out of their heads and just use the stuff.

Open a @MakerDAO CDP.
Stake ARK tokens.
Buy 100 grams of DGX.
Breed a crypto kitty.
Trade a token with @ParadexIO
Send a shielded ZEC transaction.

1 hr using things beats 5 hrs pontificating.

1030 2018-04-10 21:31:36 I just think it's BS hat all these companies converting crypto to fiat and back need so much personal information to supposedly fight laundering. Even small ATMs are asking for a phone number now.
1031 2018-04-10 21:31:35 One of my big bets for 2018 is trading on #Switcheo around 20 cents. #Apex $CPX will be listing on #LBank in a few days. Apparently there’s huge demand in China for it so now might be a good time to pick some up. #Crypto
1032 2018-04-10 21:31:33 Don’t go thinking that you’re the only super model of $crypto, @TheRealBHuggins !

1043 2018-04-10 21:30:19 I think crypto will survive. It's a feasible idea it's just the focus has been on speculation and making $ (which wasn't the point).  They can *in theory* find you unless you tumble the coin.

1058 2018-04-10 21:29:12 TBC is a crypto-currency much like Bitcoin.  

Unlike Bitcoin, TBC Price only goes up and is not driven by the “Markets.”  

The price of TBC is directly attached to the true value of any currency—its base of users.

1061 2018-04-10 21:28:29 I actually see a $5T #crypto market someday, just until 5-10 years from now. So it will probably get to $10 at some point, but not for awhile. $3-$5 for the next 1-5 years seems a lot more reasonable.

1082 2018-04-10 21:24:37 Shortening a name expresses familiarity and a laconic disrespect linguistically.  Perhaps they are trying to express frustration because your crypto arguments have gotten in their heads, caused unpleasant dissonance and they want you out of their head.

1100 2018-04-10 21:22:09 In crypto, the word scam is often used to mean: "I don't like you." or "I don't like your idea." or "I don't like your project" or "I don't think that will work" or all of the above. Rarely does it mean, fraud, misrepresentation, theft, something illegal, or something fraudulent.
1101 2018-04-10 21:21:56 If you don't know how to do it! 
That doesn't mean it's impossible. Lol

1121 2018-04-10 21:19:41 It is not about patterns. You are absolutely right to advise people to be cautious about investments like this. But just bc something has frothy moments does not mean the underlying tech is not sound.Crypto is in its infancy but here to stay. Buy low, dollar cost average and HODL

1133 2018-04-10 21:17:18 that shift card you have to pay tax on it IRS says crypto's is property not a recognized currency so you will have to report the gains and the losses. if you dont report penalties and possible jail time

1210 2018-04-10 21:07:01 Agreed...but here's scenario. Ppl "sold" #BTC near ATH to buy alts. Held alts into NY, then came taxes..No "like kind" in crypto, so trading BTC for alt is taxable. Now, alts worth 1/2 or less but tax liability is huge. I'm fine but my '17 "gains" reflected too high comparatively

1238 2018-04-10 21:04:48 FYI, August 1 2017 Bitcoin forked into Bitcoin BCH and Bitcoin BTC.

They are both Bitcoin, they are forks competing for hashpower, they share the same genesis. Conflating one or the other as just Bitcoin is a mistake. @Bitcoin is not tweeting against Bitcoin.
1239 2018-04-10 21:04:47 Did any of them actually try to answer that question in their presentations?

1245 2018-04-10 21:03:53 Inherent value means independent of perspective, value in itself. Even from a human perspective, things are always relative. Example: A fortune in Roman Denari. The Roman Empire is no more. No value for you. Or I have some delicious food. I eat it. Value for you? Again, none.

1260 2018-04-10 21:02:33 Honestly who the hell even cares if followers were bought...if the content is legit that should be the only thing that matters. Buying followers is a funny and somewhat strange thing to do but that's all that it implies.
1261 2018-04-10 21:02:31 How to spot a crypto influencer that doesn't care about you:

Anyone who's a in trading-mentor position suggesting or bragging about trading w/50x-100x is irresponsible and doesn't give one fuck about you. Might as well tell your group to buy lottery tickets.

Peace.

1356 2018-04-10 20:53:40 And yeah, Crypto is confusing to the average person. This handle is taking advantage of that to shill $BCH and luring those members into it.

1368 2018-04-10 20:52:32 You're a laughable joke if you don't think so.

When the average user becomes confused and says "fuck this crypto stuff" and goes back to a 401K, that affects the overall market cap and those little numbers add up.

At entry level, people are looking at $BTC. Not $BCH.

1519 2018-04-10 20:36:02 Pro tip :
Your biggest bags only moon when you sell them
1520 2018-04-10 20:35:57 Do you have an account? I haven't really enjoyed it at all, expected more honestly
1521 2018-04-10 20:35:56 Crypto follows you because they want to learn. The side effect of that is you deal with the brunt of over-exuberant and blind cryptos who don't like their analysis being disagreed with.

1537 2018-04-10 20:33:40 I started with Bittrex, it was my onramp.  It definitely isn't my favorite, and wish they had better coins but out of all I feel the safest with it - being located in the US and all that.  For the long run hopefully they get it together and become the standard.

1551 2018-04-10 20:32:15 This not a warrant to seize evidence in the typical manner. Due to the attorney client privilege laws, the AG must have very strong evidence to suspect crime and reason to believe that evidence will be destroyed. A warrant to raid a law office is not at all a common occurrence!

1557 2018-04-10 20:31:25 How to lose in crypto: 1) get in on a bull market 2) think you are god 3) get rekt and blame everyone else 4) continue failing and blaming everyone 5) realize this isn't working and start a paid group 6) disappear like so many others.
1558 2018-04-10 20:31:21 But when govt’s keep printing money through QE the price of BTC will rise thanks to the relative expansion of the Fiat money supply.

1576 2018-04-10 20:28:42 Winning in crypto: 1) get rekt and scammed 2) learn the angles 3) learn when to sell 4) if you suck at selling, learn to limit the scale of your losses 5) find smart, self-aware and ambitious friends 6) collaborate with homies about trade ides, and divide the research

1579 2018-04-10 20:28:12 It means that the US was buying time with their reserves. And the could probably afford to part with 4000 tons. Which gives them 4000 tons left. Which is lots still.

1581 2018-04-10 20:27:42 So an opinion causes everyone to sell. Sad. Peoples minds are being manipulated.

1587 2018-04-10 20:27:03 That's exactly what forgiveness is for. Its not a solution, and it doesn't erase what happened. It's to forgive them, to release them from their suffering of knowing they've hurt someone. It releases those doing the forgiving as well. It allows everyone involved to move forward.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1661 2018-04-10 20:17:11 Good day for twitter and honest users getting into crypto
1662 2018-04-10 20:16:35 The wedge they are exploiting IMHO is short time preference (getting immediate payment system now) over quality/harmony and building a system to change the world.  The only people listening in crypto are libertarians.  They're dividing impatient and patient libertarians.
1663 2018-04-10 20:16:32 #Zuckerberg is currently apologetic to the Senate following the Cambridge Analytica privacy fiasco. How do you think he will fare in the lawsuit on the #crypto ads ban on #Facebook?

1668 2018-04-10 20:15:04 @ashugarg - IMHO-both are true. Outside Silicon Valley the internet was a ‘special project ‘ in ‘94 aside the academic + Cern  few. In 2018 crypto is known (loose but true) in almost every connected nation globally. With thanks @timberners_lee @Satoshi_N_ @VitalikButerin

1674 2018-04-10 20:14:19 Let’s all remember that we’re nearing a point in crypto where it’s not going to be profitable for bears to continue shorting the market

We are approaching the flippening where profit will be accumulated for manipulators by going in a general up direction

1724 2018-04-10 20:08:48 What?
1725 2018-04-10 20:08:23 A more likely scenario is the dollar crashes when Saudi Arabia pulls out of the petrodollar after China takes control of Asia-Pacific trade and money flows to crypto currencies to escape fiat volatility.
1726 2018-04-10 20:08:14 that is why Twitter so far is the only viable and useful network for #Crypto conversation.

1728 2018-04-10 20:08:01 This is good news. Both sides of this “beef” have been a tremendous help to me as I started in crypto. There is no winner of this feud but your TA brain is a great asset to the community. Kudos for burying this as I know it cannot be easy regardless of who is right/wrong.
1729 2018-04-10 20:07:59 That's because they knew he would be lying. He literally just said that when you post something on Facebook the user has the control over who sees their content. He literally just lied bold-faced before Congress.

1768 2018-04-10 20:04:20 I think what Alex is getting at is PoS weights voting power and reward potential on stake, so it’s in the staker’s best interest to accumulate as much of the weighted voting power as possible, staking more and more wealth. This PoS becomes centralized to the wealthy.

1990 2018-04-10 19:39:38 You don't get it. Crypto is about the ability to switch. Noone is forced to use a certain currency anymore based on location. This new element of choice is what's new and what we didn't have before.

2080 2018-04-10 19:27:26 Guys,

Their method one or more buy before the pump and then them pump the price to the sky and sell to you and after secondes the price is going down .

2090 2018-04-10 19:26:19 A science doesn't need to be discover again and again. He has to use existing math/science. The question is "Is selfish mining possible in Bitcoin? is CSW correct?". All other stuff is beside the point and silly.

Congress stalled on chipped credit cards for years. They still think backdoor crypto is secure. 

They dont take digital security seriously.

Have you ever heard of smart contracts? By using the Ethereum technology, the smart contracts are pre-determined and the blockchain only enforces them, which enables companies to completely overcome the need for trust.

2181 2018-04-10 19:12:40 I'm curious to what your definition of a 'market' is? 
When you say markets are efficient until their not... you make it sound like there is a certain point which a market itself doesn't allow for itself to function as itself for some reason. I find that odd.

2214 2018-04-10 19:09:46 so the lendconnect team have two crypto lending? please answer me
2215 2018-04-10 19:09:43 I know a fantasy coin with a working platform that wouldn't do this to you, but what do I know, I'm just an adorable puppy.
2216 2018-04-10 19:09:31 It’s in @bitfinex interest to keep the Bitcoin trading market alive. I say Bitfinex audit their KYC data and flag these cartel members engaging in market manipulation. They would lose out on the cartel’s ‘maker fees’ but long-term would equate to significantly higher revenues.

2230 2018-04-10 19:07:27 Why take all advice as attacks?

2234 2018-04-10 19:07:00 Never understood this, but if the CME futures are cash-settled and no delivery of actual Bitcoin is taking place, so no short futures sellers forced to buy Bitcoin in the spot market to deliver to long contract holders where is the link between the Bitcoin spot and futures price?
2235 2018-04-10 19:06:54 Yeah. I have seen it with domain names ALMOST similar to the original ones.

2285 2018-04-10 19:02:51 ECC isn't an ICO or some fly by night crypto project. It's 4 years of blood and sweat from one of the original bitcoin devs and his team. It's one of the few gems in the industry that has the potential for 1000x returns over the coming years. DYOR though. It'll back me up.

2434 2018-04-10 18:51:35 not so sure about that. that would seem like a bad move on their part to "denounce" cryptocurrencies by banning them and then coming out with one of their own? doesn't make sense. how do you tell your audience, "Crypto is bad" but then say, "but buy our crypto."

2503 2018-04-10 18:44:57 We can disagree but you can't make any refuting points. You efforts so far, to recap, have been that bitcoin must have value because 1) creating a bitcoin requires a lot of electricity. 2) bitcoin uses some encryption 3) it is an inefficient way to store code if the internet ends

2539 2018-04-10 18:41:44 Interesting comparison, but "easy access to buy" beats "heard of" for defining the susceptible population, and access is continually increasing. A week or two of 10% increases could easily start the spread amongst the newly susceptible yet again, creating further viral adoption.

2632 2018-04-10 18:33:25 Explain. Did you get in on ICO? Are you US citizen? Was your BTC returned to you?

I've known them to be very approachable and professional. 

So what are the details.
2633 2018-04-10 18:33:25 How little we need, just a small, micro, pump... and the whole #crypto community gets bullish as crazy. Love it.

2667 2018-04-10 18:30:52 My mistake. You're right. Hostile threats on social media is a much better idea and way more effective. If that doesn't work, try passive aggressive snarky comments on a regular basis on other tweets. that will clear all this up in a hurry. 

Good luck.
2668 2018-04-10 18:30:41 Ultimately the costs of this will come down with decentralized networks, crypto.

Compliance with data issues becomes basically sunk cost of building the platform. Then it becomes a marketing issue. I don't think gov't, given who is currently in congress, can solve this.
2669 2018-04-10 18:30:39 People hyping like #Bittrex is going to start alt season... the problem is lack of the same enthusiasm for the market as last year. A market open without any buyers ain’t shit  #crypto #btc #altcoins

2904 2018-04-10 18:09:28 The worst is not the fake accounts promoting free crypto's, the worst is the fake/hacked accounts chatting about how easy it was to get it.

2907 2018-04-10 18:09:10 There's room for improvement, sure. But the community does need someone to bring some transparency to the game. Will it be @TheICOJournal ? Who knows. Maybe it'll be you. But you have to start by being unbiased and open minded to other opinions. Stay woke.
2908 2018-04-10 18:09:07 So 75 every 44h for this block, next time it halves it’ll go back to 32.5? And then another half until all coins are “mined”?

2926 2018-04-10 18:07:29 I'm slowly becoming bullish which is very exciting. However, im remaining objective as this is the best approach to minimize losses. Picked up all my Ethereum and alt's in the recent weeks so my portfolio is set. #crypto #bitcoin #Ethereum

1) identity verification of drivers and passengers 
2) crypto to fiat conversion. For expenses like gas and care maintenance
2929 2018-04-10 18:07:19 Oh my... baseless claims as usual. No one cares about speculators. We are in this long term, BCH is focused on adoption and innovation and it will dominate crypto. Deal with it.

2940 2018-04-10 18:06:47 Things like this make you lose credibility... why are you not focusing on promoting Bitcoin Cash rather than trashing the ‘competition’ (I’m not even sure they are mutually exclusive)? It’s just so petty and unprofessional. And people wonder why crypto isn’t taken seriously...
2941 2018-04-10 18:06:47 Stocks are the long game.... ups and downs happen, just keep plugging the cash in there. crypto is more of a sport

3028 2018-04-10 18:00:14 Golem, an ICO that raised a gazillion of ETH a few years ago, just released their product, which allows anyone to sell their computer's computing power to imaginary people willing to pay for it.
Thousands of crypto investors are about to learn the meaning of "market fit".

3048 2018-04-10 17:58:21 Using bitcoins blockchain you can deploy code that gets distributed through the ledger. That code then can be retrieved by a private key or can be viewed by anyone who knows how to use block explorers. So in other words instead of buying server space at amazon. Use #bitcoin bro.
3049 2018-04-10 17:58:13 Not dismissing you comments. Actually agree that people can monetize their content. Free doesn't put food on the table. But can we agree that 50k wasn't a joke? Just an idea that wasn't well received by the mkt. Can we do that and be friends?

3142 2018-04-10 17:51:20 It does, and if bitcoin provided me with electricity or encrypted my shit then it would have value.
3143 2018-04-10 17:51:16 Fair enough.  I don’t think good money necessarily needs inherent value. I’m not convinced bitcoin doesn’t have any.  A lot of work goes into securing the network.  The most secure network in the world must be worth something. Whatever HORSE to the moon.

3171 2018-04-10 17:49:05 From your crypto utopian day dream where the bull run is starting 

You've got a while
3172 2018-04-10 17:49:04 Bittrex just opened registration again. Now all the noobs can come in a FOMO buy just so the whales can sell off the rest of their crypto before we reach bottom. #bitcoin
3173 2018-04-10 17:48:59 Nice ! Haven’t thought about this in this way ... but i’m new to trading, holding and crypto since October 2017. Really looking forward to learn some moves from @360_trader lessons 
3174 2018-04-10 17:48:59 I‘m sorry, but I have seen enough of this guy. He wrote a thread earlier today that was clearly geared toward making liberals appear to be crypto-fascists/fascist sympathizers and disqualify them with as hominems without actually addressing liberal views.

3180 2018-04-10 17:48:32 Now that Bittrex is open for new registrations. Don't forget to stock up on Goldcoin. This crypto has loads of unique features to rival any top crypto out there. With 40 million circulating supply and only 7 cents. This beauty is ready for massive growth. #bittrex #goldcoin $GLD
3181 2018-04-10 17:48:31 That’s a good thing right 
3182 2018-04-10 17:48:23 Well things not going there way but they are here to stay. #crypto #bitcoin
3183 2018-04-10 17:48:23 That sounds reasonable, but would you mind if I asked someone like Scott Helme who understands crypto vastly better than me their opinion of this arrangement?

3185 2018-04-10 17:48:16 That's why I never post low cap coins

3223 2018-04-10 17:44:54 Flippening is inevitable. There are couple scenarios how this plays out but the outcome is the same (the only difference is the timeframe). The most certain case: 2019 financial crisis, banks go bust, QEs,  mass migration to crypto, btc mempool exploson, BCH = global currency.

3330 2018-04-10 17:38:21 It’s hard to get to the crypto because there’s so much craziness before you get there. Like the decision to use trinary. Seriously? Because someday there might be trinary hardware? That’s bonkers.

3357 2018-04-10 17:36:24 After being involved in cryptocurrency for so long, it's incredible to me dealing with banks about anything. People say crypto is complicated, but once you know how to use it, it really is a hell of a lot less complicated then dealing with banks.
3358 2018-04-10 17:36:23 Hey, finally a bank that uses ripple! They did misspel it tho.

3361 2018-04-10 17:36:16 Bitcoin’s market cap is minuscule compared to other assets. It’s less than a single company like IBM. Less than 1/4 the size of Facebook. The volatility now is because of that. Futures markets just allow governments and banks to suppress the price just like gold and silver.

3465 2018-04-10 17:28:45 Violation of the laws of immutability of code in the crypto world is like violating the laws of equality, love and natural justice.  You can’t say I can conveniently redefine justice as I want.  Sorry @VitalikButerin, I like you but you have sinned.  Wrong precedent! It’s a stain
3466 2018-04-10 17:28:38 We all live in what we believe is a sanitary World. Read “I contain multitudes” to understand that we are hosts to more foreign DNA than our own - we are all being eaten daily - the handdryer is one of millions of issues - who prepares your food? Cooks and kitchens?

3471 2018-04-10 17:28:21 This week, the Bank of Canada stole the Canadian people of monetary freedom by banning them from purchasing cryptos with their debit and credit cards. As the Crypto community is so strong, people started using @LocalBitcoins more and the site saw a x6 increase in trade volume
3472 2018-04-10 17:28:16 I don't care about fees. I'm interested in storing value. and bcash's performance compared to btc sucks.
Why to lead a fee debates where bcash sucks in storing value. Than rather paying fees for now until we have a real solution for that.
Stop the bcash propaganda machine.

3746 2018-04-10 17:05:31 we should start something between our other sock puppets and draw attention to it so everyone ends up fighting. not just two but then whole crypto twitter will be fiting
3747 2018-04-10 17:05:27 Insider news of the day - Mumbai based Blockchain startups that have nothing to do with crypto are also fearing the worst and already exploring options to move base to a crypto friendly country. 

Congrats @RBI, you have initiated the Brain Drain Part - 2.

More info coming soon.

3751 2018-04-10 17:05:13 Insane to me $NVDA's recent weakness is attributed to being a "crypto play".. This company is rock solid with exposure in the microchip space as well as AI.. That said, congrats if you invested because you thought it was crypto. Smartest mistake you've ever made.

3789 2018-04-10 17:02:47 . but I'd expect the overall trend to continue upwards unless something really stupid happens.
 I'd also expect a fairly large dump at pivotal price points ( .10, .25, .50) and also dates (like the day before the announcement as people try and protect their profits

We could see this run for the next 7 days, albeit with volatility and profit grabs happening in the process..
3799 2018-04-10 17:01:50 Nah it’s not. Crypto is dying . Only a few will survive and are you sure its icon? I don’t

3805 2018-04-10 17:01:29 Fomo would normally take us into overbought territory where a 50% retracement of the current run would be normal and healthy.  Then that would spark a panic sell down to over sold territory... while it ping pongs through the bollinger bands.

4005 2018-04-10 16:44:12 Issue is that crypto markets are so perception driven right now that even if your incentives line up the market's flux will cause your coin to appear unstable
4006 2018-04-10 16:44:09 @arconaico is the number 1 crypto coin.
4007 2018-04-10 16:44:08 It's because your twitter shills have direct access to their brains and fingers that make them buy... No research necessary.

4255 2018-04-10 16:20:55 The best purpose of MONETO is to provide an opportunity for registered users in the system to obtain a currency for a specified period, and then, without significant transaction costs, return the crypto-investment.

4323 2018-04-10 16:13:37 2) other assets. Notice that when charting it this way, all of the other assets were in massive bubbles compared to their underlying indices/comparable assets, whereas bitcoin, with a market cap of $115 billion right now, is enormously undervalued compared to gold ($7 trillion)

4466 2018-04-10 15:58:43 That is quite sad for it defeats the whole purpose of why crypto even exists in the first place as far as I am concerned, it needs to be decentralized to break through this shit we are currently under.
4467 2018-04-10 15:58:35 en Espana es mucho o se compara como aqui en USA ??
4468 2018-04-10 15:58:22 I wonder if capital isn't an immutable feature of an economy though. The thing that matters is its distribution and how it is employed? The deflationary aspect of many crypto's, I think, could have some positive emergent properties in relation to those things... Potentially...
4469 2018-04-10 15:58:21 If RBI bans bitcoin, they only exclude ind from revolution the  world is going through, nd push us down. Its true banks are scared as hell, if  crypto becum mainstream they will go out of business and rbi took a very diplomatic approch to kp contrls in their own hands.

4515 2018-04-10 15:54:32 I want to put it on record that im@not buying this whole “Crypto is down because of US tax day and it will recover after 17 April”!
4516 2018-04-10 15:54:29 Pretty much i was a believer at one point but its all hype, on the other hand verge is taking off and they dont post nearly as much shit as tron, its all bs

4649 2018-04-10 15:41:27 higher lows is a good sign a temporary bottom is in. i feel comfortable accumulating at this stage for now. historically the 2nd quarter for crypto has always been green dating back to 2010.
4650 2018-04-10 15:41:25 No. 

and I wouldn't dare post it even if I did... because we all know if I said something like 9am... and the announcement didn't happen until 10am... I'd be pitch forked, tarred and feathered, set on fire, and hung.

4938 2018-04-10 15:18:03 I think, India is banning crypto currency only to make way for its own crypto.
4939 2018-04-10 15:17:59 Possibly because they are a large shareholder of some companies who uses silver in production? Just a guess. Sometimes you buy things just to keep it controlled.

4995 2018-04-10 15:12:15 New services don’t really necessarily mean adoption as a currency. There is very little economic incentive for a business to want to accept crypto. Double digit moves in value make for a rocky landscape for a small business and there are still very few real world transactions.

Regardless, be it legal issues to people thinking it's not a real currency. What I said still stands. There is clearly manipulation and insider trading running rampant in the Crypto-market and Coinbase is undoubtedly a part of that. #sitdownboi
5089 2018-04-10 15:05:01 Its a very BIG FUD. They recently partenered with Coinbase. Its a purely BS report because Barclays is hedging BTC. BTC price goes down, they make money. Watch and research what these FI's are into, if they FUD, they're in crypto

5092 2018-04-10 15:04:39 its not the explaining part so much as it is how to aquire it, without exchanges with a cc, without the need for BTC. Straight fiat to ANY crypto.. Like shopping on amazon. Perhaps if the site was built on a peername .com domain.  Maintain the trustless part.

5096 2018-04-10 15:04:24 try reading up on this, try to identify crypto that is on an uptrend and never sell if you miss the trade, just set a rigid sell order on your exchange and wait for it to hit that point,
5097 2018-04-10 15:04:23 The one thing that we have yet to encounter in he #crypto space is Trump. Let's say $BTC crosses 50k, that will really get his attention. And he will have no idea wtf it is, and won't like a new money competing with the $USD
5098 2018-04-10 15:04:23 Anything can happen in #crypto. I believe #FOMO will hit shortly.

5216 2018-04-10 14:56:21 @Quantstamp Can you explain why a token is used to audit contracts?
5217 2018-04-10 14:56:20 @RBI
Crypto should be regulate or legalise because it is beneficial for our country in many ways.
5218 2018-04-10 14:56:18 そうだったの！？よかった！おくったらノートかってやってね！笑
5219 2018-04-10 14:56:15 Sure does not feel like it
5220 2018-04-10 14:55:52 Yeah, a lot of crypto projects are aiming towards this. Likely we'll sell our information to big companies (Facebook, Google, Amazon) and be rewarded with either tokens (because of low transaction fees) or a discount.
5221 2018-04-10 14:55:49 Why are a lot of the low market cap coins pumping? Check out $hpb $fsn $cov $thc $wan and many others... Is someone getting ready for bullrun? @officiallykeith @MichaelSuppo

5225 2018-04-10 14:55:21 LOL! You guys are a little late to the party. But then again, that's no surprise. You Wallstreet stooges are always calling for sells near the bottom and buys near the top. You make for the perfect contrarian indicator

5242 2018-04-10 14:54:04 I am not a psychic or fortune teller. But I see Verge reaching heights we never would have dreamed of. Adoption is the key for any crypto Project. Lot of good projects still in the shelves waiting for adoption. I guess XVG in 2 digits in 2019. We will never see this LOW price.

5257 2018-04-10 14:53:13 Everyone has to agree #Bitcoin was overbought due speculations and the nature of humans, however, even if the price would drop to $1000-$1500, it would rebound to new all time highs in just few years! You can not outrun real time adoption & innovation with greed.

5264 2018-04-10 14:52:22 Crypto is not for noobs. Crypto slaughters noobs and takes their wives.
5265 2018-04-10 14:52:17 You just gotta tell yourself it’s only the price that’s changed, nothing else. Fundamentals are still the same in fact better now than they have ever been, cycles are still the same. Nothing has changed, just lack of confidence due to a market crash. Long term, we good.
5266 2018-04-10 14:52:17 Thanks for the feedback. We can’t comment on business development milestones or internal deadlines. The reason for this is: we do not control every piece that must fall into place to launch the secure and reliable market our customers have come to expect.

5351 2018-04-10 14:45:43 That may be true. In my eyes, it’s super smart. I don’t think the masses are ready for decentralisation yet. They’re too technically inept to even understand what it means. So technology like this will do for the interim period. Anyone who wants privacy/decentralisation can.

5360 2018-04-10 14:45:19 If you're waiting to get on the crypto wagon, keep waiting. $BTC predicted to hit the bottom at $4888. DM if u tryna learn how to get ready now..
5361 2018-04-10 14:45:09 Instead of building your own. You can buy a prebuild because at least I and a few other I know, find PC parts overall more expensive than pre-build because of the crypto/bit-mining market.

Lots of bad information out there. People fill in the blanks of what they don't know with made up facts and mislead.

5560 2018-04-10 14:27:22 and some take 3 years before they can even offer or be used. And don’t mean the public can invest into stocks just yet. The rule is if you can’t grow and you are in debt more then in gain then you might have to accept you failed. Crypto is neither in these things.

5570 2018-04-10 14:25:39 Sure it will be accelerated due to volume, but IIRC finex had margin in 14/15. And accelerated still means we have a month more of down and a few more after that of sideways and smaller drops.

5579 2018-04-10 14:24:47 The crypto correction is a perfect time to spot and unfollow shillers of "good undervalued" projects.

In a free market, the price is always as much as the people decide. At any given moment.

The future knows if a good is undervalued or overvalued. But no one knows the future.

5604 2018-04-10 14:22:55 But the way I see it crypto, as it’s structured now, is completely unusable as a currency due to the volatility. All I ever hear people say is wait until there is mass adoption but there is nothing to bridge the gap. We need stability now to attain mass adoption.

5761 2018-04-10 14:09:21 Crypto is just like in the .com era. Everyone is buying .com names and useless companies, and they all failed more or less. The wealth from the tech will be elsewhere.

1シェアー当たりの採掘量は，これまで一定値で近似できましたが，9月15日から減って来ています。2018-01現在は以前の1/6ぐらいに。採掘量の変動を考慮した形に改良してみてその減少ぶりにびっくり。

5772 2018-04-10 14:08:25 Hmm, we're getting deep on this one :-). I think we should take a broader motivation theory into account while designing #crypto. Not just game theory or mechanisms design. In math-based theories, there are lots of rational behaviour assumptions

5780 2018-04-10 14:07:34 Why am I buying more #Crypto when I am down 70-80% on certain coins on my #HODL List. 

Its called DOLLAR AVERAGING 

Lets Say I bought 1000 #XRP at $2.80 

& 1000 #XRP at $0.50 

Average it: 2000 XRP at $3,300
(1 $XRP = $1.65) 

Thats how we play!!! You will be rewarded, #HODL !

5788 2018-04-10 14:06:34 It's so predicatable. They have limited terminology. We know who the real snowflakes are. These crypto fascists however are easy to take out because they are so fragile. That's the saving grace.

5906 2018-04-10 13:57:30 The hopes many pin on crypto for wealth and or global socioeconomic revolution combined with esoteric technical details understood by only a handful of elite computer scientists, who themselves lack consensus on many points, is pretty  fertile ground for cult mentalities.

6027 2018-04-10 13:46:16 I don’t know what the crypto market will do but I think the possibility of a short starts making less sense when everyone lines up to short. Markets often reward contrarian views not consensus.
6028 2018-04-10 13:46:15 Most investors have been recently concerned as have I regarding George Soras entering the Crypto market. 

Please review his "General Theory of Reflectivity" paper, he basically states to go against the trend to invest. Does this mean he's long in a bear market??

6050 2018-04-10 13:44:07 Okay and there is still older people that “can’t” use the internet, so would you say that has not been adopted yet? There is always a certain percent that will not follow a trend.  Nonetheless we are still in the very early stages of crypto currency uses.

6299 2018-04-10 13:22:31 It's not just bitcoin but all forms of cryptocurrency. It's all volatile right now though but, it will probably become more popular as banks and governments either regulate or de-regulate crypto. It's here to stay.

6485 2018-04-10 13:09:02 2014: @business, @qz, and others have been quick to brand #bitcoin as the year’s worst investment - and do a little bit of I-told-you-so-ing in the process.
January 2014 price: $770

Current price after being 66% down from ATH: $6760

That's only 878% in 4 years. #GTFO

6491 2018-04-10 13:08:39 @Crypto_Bitlord when do you think an ATH(all time high will happen) ?
Will bitcoin ever hit 20k again or maybe even 50k ?
Will it end if the year ?
Whats your thoughts ?
When will the rally begin ?

6616 2018-04-10 12:58:16 Why should they opt for crypto for this purpose instead of a mix of other currencies + commodities?

6624 2018-04-10 12:57:31 Also because they made a public statement that they were not the partner.  Why would TokenPay donate nearly 2M to XVG to secure a partnership with themselves? Makes no sense. Also, the partner is a common household name. TokenPay is a crypto project.

6892 2018-04-10 12:29:51 The media have always worked with investors to promote and fud stocks and other instruments. It's nothing new. Thing is, most whales aren't investment banks at the moment. I think Asian has much more pull than the US.

6900 2018-04-10 12:29:14 I think many US investors got hit with unexpected tax liabilities, and selling more BTC/#cryptos to pay bill. Once that pressure removed, we can move higher. (See @fundstrat analysis, puts it at $25B)

7056 2018-04-10 12:17:14 My trader friend just ignores crypto because it is not mainstream. He completely dismisses the fact that people made billions of dollars here, just because his weekly magazine does not report on that. He's kinda old-fashioned. Hates games and shit...
7057 2018-04-10 12:17:13 this comment is too spot on. bitcoin is the most impossible crypto to predict. only takes 1-2 times where btc burns you. nowadays i'm an alt trader online. Scalping btc imo is a death wish.

7091 2018-04-10 12:14:14 Don’t know about you guys but credit card interest rates in Australia are around 23-24%. That’s a lot of wasted money if you get rekt on crypto. At least with clothes you have something to show for your debt 
7092 2018-04-10 12:14:09 All I’m saying is that instead of the ICO pitches and conferences that cater to people already in the know, perhaps it would be good to do an education tour aimed at the grassroots level to grow the space. Emphasis on the use case of blockchain/crypto not the investment side.
7093 2018-04-10 12:14:05 @tokenpay is not the mystery partner... they've said it publicly and what kind of sense would it make for TokenPay to be the largest donation to secure their own partnership? Also TokenPay isn't a common household name that would change crypto.  They're a crypto project. Sheesh

7101 2018-04-10 12:13:33 That should be the long-term goal, but it has turned into a commodity, and it's hard to be a commodity and replacement for fiat at the same time. #blockchain #bitcoin #btc #crypto

7268 2018-04-10 11:58:18 WTF? @AltOne_Crypto Never Said a Bad word about you 
7269 2018-04-10 11:58:18 This is true.  But it is hindering mass adoption.  Crypto is BRUTALLY unforgiving.  I'm not saying people should get passes on being fucking morons, but we are all human.  In crypto a freaking typo can cost you thousands.  Mass adoption won't  happen without improved simplicity.
7270 2018-04-10 11:58:07 I see a 900million market cap. Prior to crypto we were at less than half this level. That is quite a lot of value placed on an unprofitable venture with nothing to show for itself thus far. I've looked into the other Medici companies, most are small stakes in unproven projects

7447 2018-04-10 11:40:16 Good point.  Compared to crypto in general, USD (and GBP, and pretty much any state currency) has a couple of centuries' lead in facilitating the less attractive aspects of human existence.  All relative.  Assigning morals to currencies (rather than currency users) is pointless.

7577 2018-04-10 11:28:37 Great , i just used LTC as my preffered crypto and received almost x10 back, Thank you so much @BithumbOfficial 
7578 2018-04-10 11:28:27 おぉぉTOさん！お優しい方や！
さっきまでみんなにいじられてリップラー恐怖症に落ちかけてたんが嘘のようや！
7579 2018-04-10 11:28:15 dabbled in crypto a little, burnt my fingers slightly
7580 2018-04-10 11:28:02 Why tho
7581 2018-04-10 11:27:58 Hacked with a new computer, new BFX account, new e-mail / password, new 2FA. How in hell is that even possible?

7583 2018-04-10 11:27:55 Lux coin will do amazing things
7584 2018-04-10 11:27:46 where do you hedge it?
7585 2018-04-10 11:27:39 Yes
7586 2018-04-10 11:27:38 The more they do to you the stronger you would be

7588 2018-04-10 11:27:19 Which Crypto Currency do you believe will be the most commonly used by 2021?

#BTC #BITCOIN #ETH #ETHERIUM #NEO #LTC #LITECOIN #TRON #CRYPTOFOLLOW #CRYPTO #COINBASE #BINANCE #KUCOIN #NEO #HASHFLARE #BITTREX #TRX #TRXARMY #LTC #ADA #ICX
7589 2018-04-10 11:27:16 KOOL!!
7590 2018-04-10 11:27:15 Any anonymous crypto debit cards btw? Asking for a mate
7591 2018-04-10 11:27:04 @crypto_rand  What do you think of BCPT (Blockmason Credit Protocol) long term?
7592 2018-04-10 11:26:42 Bought at 3100. This coin did not recover yet. Too dip from 12000.
7593 2018-04-10 11:26:39 Damn. Sorry to hear that dude.
7594 2018-04-10 11:26:38 are you working with the feds?
7595 2018-04-10 11:26:33 #isupportcrypto make crypto currency legal in india. Whole world is trying to regulate  crypto currencies but India is indirectly banning crypto currencies @narendramodi
7596 2018-04-10 11:26:27 ここに来て、まだまだ下がるって煽りが少しずつtwitterに出てきたような…となると、やっぱり底近い気もする。
7597 2018-04-10 11:26:24 Why no 2fa ?
7598 2018-04-10 11:26:23 Damn. Sorry to hear man. Well, take @princedoaag under your wing and show him the way of the soy. It's all he's got now
7599 2018-04-10 11:26:23 Why to choose same exchange when it has been hacked? Something fishy
7600 2018-04-10 11:26:22 cos they all own ICOs of crypto debit card products
7601 2018-04-10 11:26:18 Obviously always do your own research my top 3 picks and biggest holdings are $Wan $ONT & $NCASH all mid-longterm holds and imo will do extremely well end of year - all have a great working projects #Blockchain #IoT - #China #Trust
7602 2018-04-10 11:26:16 Would that be possible to convert in crypto every once in a while? Like @dustcrypto does
7603 2018-04-10 11:26:04 Go for it
7604 2018-04-10 11:25:48 sad emotes only
7605 2018-04-10 11:25:47 May the force be with you :(
7606 2018-04-10 11:25:46 さっきできたで！
そしたらわい一番やんけ！ひゃっはー！
7607 2018-04-10 11:25:38 えへへへへへ(*´ω｀*)
7608 2018-04-10 11:25:35 ビットコイン、すごく嫌なところでレンジに入りますね。やはりここで買うのは危ないんかなぁ…
7609 2018-04-10 11:25:11 ツイッターほんと便利すぎませんか？？
ツイッターの出始めって、なんしに自分の日常人に垂れ流すねんと思ってましたが、今はツイッターすごく頼もしいです。 便利すぎるだろ…
7610 2018-04-10 11:25:10 I would like to hear crypto news on a daily basis. I liked the first SUPPODAILY thought it was funny,but the second one I could not hear and quite make out what you are saying. Love the look but loose the accent.

7617 2018-04-10 11:24:30 会員番号あったんだw
7618 2018-04-10 11:24:20 About bloody time - I am expecting $Ncash to go on a good run over next couple of weeks - so let’s see
7619 2018-04-10 11:24:17 I have stated so many times here that I dont trade C&H and I mention "some would call this a C&H" 
Why neglecting my other replies? Trying hard to find something to bash?
Get a life. 
Oh, I personally think I work a lot more as the ones I seem to sell snake oil
7620 2018-04-10 11:23:52 Exactly! My buddy does infosec. And laughed @ #crypto. "You'll get hacked" then what do you do?
7621 2018-04-10 11:23:30 Absolutly no
7622 2018-04-10 11:23:20 $fsn / Fusion - this is up 40% in last week. Wanchain killer. 52m total supply and killer team. Mainnet launch Q2 this year! Nobody talking about it which I can’t believe. Still a sleeper with huge gains capable. Total cap $82m right now.
7623 2018-04-10 11:23:18 Şu sicil ile crypto halen ilk adres görülmeyebilir, herşeyden önce düşüşü tamamlamalı ki altın, yüksek faiz, tahvil gibi istikrarlı seçeneklere alternatif olarak görülebilsin
7624 2018-04-10 11:23:17 In its current state, Crypto is arguably far more susceptible to CDO-Style shenanigans than investment banks and rating agencies.  Blockchain Governance srsly lags tech...and enforcement? See Tezos.
7625 2018-04-10 11:23:09 はよ勉強せいクソバッタ
7626 2018-04-10 11:23:09 Someone who takes the system's CSPRNG and pipe it into RC4 has nothing to do near crypto code. I'm shocked but not surprised to find this in yet another cryptocurrency app.
7627 2018-04-10 11:22:51 i have money invested crypto I would love to spend. This would be the cheapest and quickest way to do it.
7628 2018-04-10 11:22:43 ですよねーww
7629 2018-04-10 11:22:30 #xvg I am not a genius, but if I had a deal that will revolutionize the crypto world as they claim! Wouldn't you wait till 100% sure & then shock the world & watch your coin skyrocket. Not give doubt with a pre-announcement?? they must have forgotten about NYE silly me! 
7630 2018-04-10 11:22:27 あら？そしたらテックビューロのmijin導入費用はサーバが大部分だということですね笑

8216 2018-04-10 10:04:24 According to me we should not go for the saturated options of cryptocurrency rather than we should opt for new cryptocurrencies like QuickX, which can well grow in the market as new currencies don’t have saturation point.

8240 2018-04-10 10:01:13 bitcoin going down with dow jones. btc wont be finished correcting until the stock market is finished. optimism at a time like this, is a sign to be ready for a fall. fear has to be at its highest for a bottom in dow jones or bitcoin.

Seems common sense, but the time you buy a $crypto asset mostly decides the profits you make.

8426 2018-04-10 09:37:58 True, it’s a great opportunity for traders to take noob money. However, for hodlers it’s annoying because when it blows up the media will paint all of crypto with the same brush and it will have a negative effect on the price of good projects.

8454 2018-04-10 09:34:54 Daily and weekly closing are extremely overestimated in crypto. In such a manipulated market closings are worth zero in a decent TA. My two cents.

8475 2018-04-10 09:33:22 If your going to trade cryptocurrencies you need to follow the 5 golden rules 
1. No one has your best interest in mind
2. Always do your fucking research
3. Only FOMO over cheap prices
4. Don’t ever panic sell. 
5. When alt-season starts, there are no rules.

8851 2018-04-10 08:48:39 The key point is nothing is perfect. Look at gold, currencies, stocks - any traded market. Theres the bullish case and the bearish case.

8852 2018-04-10 08:48:36 May I ask how exactly you want to implement a quantum - proof network encryption? The quantum random number generator only assures well distributed random numbers and QKD also has some attack vectors. I mean you would need post quantum crypto algorithms for that, right?

これですよね。出来高がどんどん落ちて行って、誰も売りも買いもせず（死に状態）、どこかで好材料から出来高を伴った少しずつの上昇トレンド形成がもっともらしいのでは、と思います。

9011 2018-04-10 08:26:34 It amazes me what marketing can do in #crypto. I’m to the point where risk management is my biggest strategy. To me, the only platforms that mix gains vs guarantee are $icx and $wan. I also love $ven $eos $neo but the mcap is too high for optimal returns. You eyeing any others?

9080 2018-04-10 08:18:09 I'm not arguing the "what is the true bitcoin" right now.

Most people getting into crypto are looking to purchase $BTC. Tricking them only hurts the entire crypto community.

$BCH should be able to stand on it's own two legs, or needs much more adoption before taking the name.

I just felt it the explanation of how it could be possible was over simplified

9091 2018-04-10 08:16:54 More difficult then with bought clothes or jewelry for example? Or worse gambling or drugs? 
Don't try to make sense of this. They clearly see crypto as a threat, and decided their customers cannot be a part of that.

Crypto ban in India will lead some harmful consequences for our country so pls think before your final decision.
9096 2018-04-10 08:16:13 The problem is the ethical approach here.

New people walking into the game are expecting to see $BTC talked about here, not $BCH.

This can confuse new users into buying $BCH then come out thinking the whole crypto game is confusing and "too hard" and quit.
9097 2018-04-10 08:16:07 We need to stop n think a little rt now, we can all talk about tokenization or technology or fight against the dictatorial leaderships but at the end it s all about money, and the governments and financial institutions are raking in billions of dollars from the crypto  market .

9125 2018-04-10 08:11:34 Yeah agreed. So the game becomes more about factoring in the behaviour of unknown actors with interests in manipulating the market, which presumably is basically impossible right?
9126 2018-04-10 08:11:33 sorry folks ...market is bearish ..bears are in control and whatever pattern we broke to the upside they tend to dump $BTC again!
I think we might see much lower lvls and we have to watch market very closely day by day to determine the direction of that day.

9163 2018-04-10 08:07:07 My pessimism on adoption comes from seeing how many smart people are against it for some reason. Some friends who are 10+ years ahead of me in IT, take extra effort to enforce the belief that all crypto is dead end tech or worse. And they enjoy sharing the anti-bitcoin articles.

9241 2018-04-10 07:57:23 @ChainGinseng.Pakistan Central Bank has issued a circular on" Prohibition of dealing in virtual currencies".It comes right after a similar move from India.Commercial banks and payment providers have been told to stay away from crypto Operations.
9242 2018-04-10 07:57:23 yes, 1 of them
9243 2018-04-10 07:57:10 @Bitcoin LN is a second layer on top of bitcoin.  It could also go on top of @Bcash, @Litecoin or any other crypto that shares the same mining algo.   Attacking this innovation is not helping your "bcash is the real bitcoin" cause.

9298 2018-04-10 07:49:08 Yeah, if you use proper decentralized exchanges (or just exchange peer-to-peer, in some other way). But the real problem is for traders and people who ALREADY did hundreds of crypto-to-crypto transactions. Now they owe like thousands or millions in taxes which is just insane.

9350 2018-04-10 07:41:58 Unfortunately, valuation is not a science. Too may variables to account for. Crypto is especially impossible to ‘value’ objectively as most offerings do not provide a current yield and have an incredibly wide range of probable outcomes.

9390 2018-04-10 07:35:28 There is supposedly $25B worth of Crypto tax that needs to be paid in the US before the 17th Apr deadline. This is just one of many reasons for the downtrend. Either way, the market won't recover until after the 17th at the earliest.
9391 2018-04-10 07:35:26 @zebpay @Unocoin 
Indian exchanges should unite together with crypto supporters to legalize crypto in India if they are true supporter of their customers.

9398 2018-04-10 07:33:38 Are you guys expecting to release any new ones in the coming days/weeks? Keep up the great work!
9399 2018-04-10 07:33:36 Nope. Pump and dump. All alts do. There is no momentum for crypto right now. What happens in the existing community doesn't move the needle. More people need to jump in. Alts are part of the solution and the problem. Too many of them and too much ripping off. It'll take a while.
9400 2018-04-10 07:33:24 funny though, crypto twitter was super bullish just couple days ago

9402 2018-04-10 07:32:57 Positive – Each coin is replicated effectively in the BTU chain. You can have both BTC and BTU following a division.
Negative – The break-up can be risk and disorganized since all the crypto currencies stick together. It’s necessary to divide them or lose your coins..#cryptonews

9483 2018-04-10 07:21:08 Okay. Well all the Bitcoin code is open source and the blockchain is public. To create a hard fork, you need to copy the Bitcoin repo and then make your protocol changes. Then you need a snapshot of the blockchain to create your copy. BTC holders get your coin because you copied.

9634 2018-04-10 07:00:32 By 2016 regular eight-figure trades were common in the OTC market. Serious money started moving into crypto. OTC markets mask real volume causing skewed BTC prices. So where'd all the institution BTC go? a) is there a motive? b) Is there a means? You do the math...

9768 2018-04-10 06:41:46 I would prefer that the leading platform be US-based. But the US is shooting itself in the foot right now, and I can't wait for us to figure it out. The rest of the world is in motion on crypto: it's wait and sink -- or swim with whoever else is swimming.
9769 2018-04-10 06:41:24 僕も納得さ！素敵な心理テストだね。
トシ君は素直が溢れ出してるね。
9770 2018-04-10 06:41:21 I know how pricing manipulation in crypto-coin trading works and I understand why it was necessary and I think I have a better way of fixing that problem.
9771 2018-04-10 06:41:14 Depends on how many other telco’s / crypto gaming and tournaments they can crack deals with. Latin America and Asia are the next targets. In SA, with MTN, there are 40,000 subscribers and will be charged a daily fee.EM1 will get 40% of it.

9776 2018-04-10 06:40:42 That doesn't make any sense, if BTC goes down one more leg your USDT value will be a certain loser. What makes sense is to say "with that Bitcoins I will just trade alts and I don't care about the USDT value".

9783 2018-04-10 06:38:56 No it isn’t. Scam means they are doing something illegal or breaking the law. Used in the context of crypto, it just means they don’t believe it’s a good investment.

9794 2018-04-10 06:36:53 I studied math for many years.

The applies everywhere in life, including #crypto - fractals and market cycles.

9895 2018-04-10 06:20:50 Bitcoin istnieje od 2009r, Temat konieczności uregulowania jego statusu nie jest czymś nowym, po krachu MtGox to była oczywistość. NIKT do tej pory nie zrobił NIC dla stworzenia stabilnych warunków do rozwoju tej branży (więc i technologii) w Polsce.
