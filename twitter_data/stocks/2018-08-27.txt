Umm ID0IT only the GOP is against bans on bump stocks, 60-round magazines and universal background checks. And require ID for voting but not to buy guns.

Do you think Stephen Paddock would have been able to kill 58 people and injure 851 more without bump stocked rifles? Not a chance with a handgun...
58 2018-08-27 23:24:21 States like Nevada allow you to shoot (not sure if you can own) fully automatic weapons, LMG's...I even saw a video of a guy shooting 65mm inert mortar rounds. Also California have banned bump stocks, 30 round mags, drum magazines as well.

63 2018-08-27 23:21:43 CEO pay raises are raises that keep rising. They’re paid in stock options and as their short term focused decisions inflate their stocks  prices, so goes their raises. More raises, more raises, more raises.

85 2018-08-27 23:10:07 And how many regular people does this really impact?  Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck and can't afford groceries let alone buying stocks.  Your daddy and other rich people benefit.  Corporations benefit.  So if we wanted to hear from an asshole we would fart.
86 2018-08-27 23:10:00 Yes, stocks are at all time highs because of a deal that has not yet gone into effect.  Genius.  How is the deficit?  Still growing?  Great move increasing the debt in a bull market.  Classic Trumponomics.  It’s called stock buybacks and artificially low interest rates...

108 2018-08-27 22:59:12 Stocks soar as President Trump reveals a new trade deal with Mexico. Trump, along with millions of Americans, has never liked #NAFTA. So, he's basically doing away with the old, and creating something very new with Mexico, and Wall Street is apparently loving it.

122 2018-08-27 22:46:09 In stocks, they have to care about their share price because it’s a publicly traded company and they’re legally bound. 

In crypto, all crypto assets are speculative in nature until we start to see mass adoption with Dapps.

3. Raise gun ownership age to 21 
4. Pass laws making it easier to prevent people with mental illness & violent history from owning guns
130 2018-08-27 22:40:27 No, making it easier to use pot just means more pot in the brains/blood of our young people. Pot is not a mild drug. Legalizing it is only good for #WallStreet pot stocks & banks. They're pushing harming our kids & fellow citizens because their other bubbles are unsustainable.

144 2018-08-27 22:36:19 Corrupt politicians get rich by insider trading, they refuse to pass a law, to stop it, same law rest of us have to live by, where you go to jail for it, they know what laws they pass will affect stocks, they know what FDA will approve before we do, they know when to buy & sell.

153 2018-08-27 22:30:42 #WallStreet/banks have been laundering drug money for decades. They're fined at times so will love legal transactions for their dope deals. Currently, there are dozens of pot stocks waiting to make a killing off the doping of our kids.

The reality is this although we think we are superior, we could not lie without all that they do and teach
157 2018-08-27 22:27:45 The "worst week of the Trump presidency" turns out to be a worse week for the media. After #Cohen & #Manafort - Trump's poll numbers hold. After doom about a 'trade war' we get a 'New NAFTA.' & stocks skyrocket. The media narrative just got crushed. Back to Russia?

202 2018-08-27 21:57:24 Yeah I’ve seen the pot stocks do the surge up and then fall quickly so sell some shares as it goes higher is my opinion, keep some if you think it’ll go higher.

226 2018-08-27 21:38:45 Banning bump stocks isn't useful. You can replicate them with a simple belt (do a quick search). Again, it seems people have no idea what they are talking about. Students talked - but it made no difference. There should be a meaningful, specific proposal people can get behind.
227 2018-08-27 21:37:43 Yes
228 2018-08-27 21:37:32 They would have done better by just being passive investors in tech stocks

261 2018-08-27 21:27:56 Market Close: MBS -9bps; DOW +259.29; NASDAQ +71.92; S&P 500 +22.05; 10yr Treasury 2.85%; Stocks take off on news of US and Mexico Trade Agreement.
262 2018-08-27 21:27:15 Yeah, I really wanted to use your stocks but I guess thats a rip 
263 2018-08-27 21:24:48 I did OK on my bread and butter stocks today which were up in spite of pot sucking the air out of the screen. I took some profits because when pot goes down it will drag everything with it. When Nortel was 40% of the index in 2001 I was trading energy and making $$$.
264 2018-08-27 21:23:47 Most Americans don’t have stocks!
265 2018-08-27 21:23:44 I think thousand yard thorazine stare Betsy needs to release her stock portfolio so all the nice people can see any recent purchases of gun manufacturer stocks.
266 2018-08-27 21:23:18 @MSNBC To the pundits that were talking late in the morning today. Majority of Americans don’t invest in stocks. So you can’t say economy is good coz stocks is doing good. Only for a small population of America.
267 2018-08-27 21:23:05 Sold all in early feb. The market felt bubbly (way to many "overvalued" stocks, noobs talking investments everywere I went etc. Don't know if I made the right choice 
268 2018-08-27 21:22:22 Not great pal! Bring in safe standing that would help hugely
269 2018-08-27 21:22:17 You negative people obviously have no stocks...mine are up....WAY UP. This teacher loves Trump and his ideas/policies!!
270 2018-08-27 21:21:29 Can you actually pick stocks to buy with Stash or basically develop portfolio with certain stocks...what if I only wanted Weed Stocks?
271 2018-08-27 21:21:13 Bollocks isn't it? The state of Man Utd and the modern game.
272 2018-08-27 21:19:45 I am consistent in being inconsistent making tweets.  Good day in $DWDP, $BABA, $C, and $APC.  I am getting killed in my specs $ETCG (down 70%) & $GBTC (down 35%) - still willing to wait it out (unless an ETF is created).  Long all stocks mentioned.
273 2018-08-27 21:19:41 Invest your money wisely and you won't be dissapointed. I invest in stocks and that saying is true.
274 2018-08-27 21:19:36 U.S. Stocks rise to begin the week. Big bucks are being spent for back-to-school. Gas prices higher this Labor Day weekend than last year.
275 2018-08-27 21:19:05 Wrong again!! Stocks jump to record highs!! Tariffs, tax cuts DO work!! #FlipEverythingRed #VoteDemsOut

283 2018-08-27 21:14:09 He curtis I sometimes think of what you said before an eventual ‘crash’ first we get a wave where oil gold stocks everything goes up. Might have started, inflation coming, now the real bubble is gonna be made and inflated? Makes sense or should I stfu?
284 2018-08-27 21:13:42 OK, stocks are at a record high and it IS Monday, but the rest of your points are either wrong or misinformed. Take the rest of the week off.

287 2018-08-27 21:11:38 @SRuhle Stocks seem to be at record highs, what say you???
288 2018-08-27 21:11:26 “Completely logical and reasonable” -that’s your opinion. And no, I don’t agree with all of it. You can have bump stocks and domestic abusers.
289 2018-08-27 21:10:55 Donald Luskin: I just love the media.  They got it all wrong.  People are making money.  They were smart to elect Trump.

Funny that they're pushing this narrative but when people were making money on stocks from 2009 - 2017, they said the economy is not improving.
290 2018-08-27 21:10:14 I feel old.
291 2018-08-27 21:09:51 Yea! Winner winner chicken dinner! My first horse lost, but second one won paying 6-1! Who needs stocks and bonds 
292 2018-08-27 21:09:25 Wilbur Ross own some stocks in that company?
293 2018-08-27 21:09:03 The bull market in pot stocks would not have gone into hyperdrive without the Sands brothers at Constellation doubling down on Canopy. This mania is very similar to the Florida land rush of 1925.   Behind every speculative bubble lies a little truth and alot of lies.
294 2018-08-27 21:08:22 Concession accounts vary. It could be in form of stocks, bonds, credit card e.t.c
295 2018-08-27 21:08:04 When do you split stocks? I need more.
296 2018-08-27 21:07:49 I mean I hate your lot but Christ don’t know where to even start with that shit! Modern football is wank ain’t it, can we click reboot? Thank god I get to go to Elland Road every week, the once advantage to being shit for 15 years, we’ve stayed old school 
297 2018-08-27 21:07:41 Even though I'm only middle class and don't have any stocks, I've stopped watching Fox News & more of Fox Business for the optimism and total respect & support for our Businessman President #MAGA EXCEPT for NoTrumper Cavato whom I loathe lol
298 2018-08-27 21:07:11 There were no other shooters, he had several bump stocks and he was shooting from two different windows
299 2018-08-27 21:06:45 When fake Warren Buffett goes on a weekend tweeting spree, stocks are up huge on Monday.

301 2018-08-27 21:05:42 Between October 14th-November 4th. Look for the hugs rally if not, before Then. Just watch this one guys....
302 2018-08-27 21:05:42 Nafta isn't terminated so Mexico deal is not valid. China isn't in NATA because it's not in North America. Stocks at record high but wages are lower than they were 18 months ago against inflation. The rich are winning blue collar losing.
303 2018-08-27 21:05:37 Nafta isn't terminated so Mexico deal is not valid. China isn't in NATA because it's not in North America. Stocks at record high but wages are lower than they were 18 months ago against inflation. The rich are winning blue collar losing.

308 2018-08-27 21:03:23 Thanks Bud. I don't usually make predictions, but what I do predict is when #Uranium stocks start to Pop in a rapidly rising #U3O8 environment then you are going to see Fission & Denison do a reverse split to boost share prices above $3 to allow institutions to buy in quantity.

325 2018-08-27 21:00:54 Very boring day on the market, none of my stocks moved. Glad I spent the afternoon in the pub.. I see the DOW had a better day, up 1%. Will that get the UK market moving tomorrow? Who knows?

328 2018-08-27 21:00:36 I just reduced cash tied to stock. Doesn’t mean I play less. I made a few times more playing option calls on NVDA than gains on stocks. Planning to buy some deep ITM calls as stock replacement.
329 2018-08-27 21:00:35 Smallpox was eradicated in the 1970s. Vaccination ended a few years later. WHO & the military keep stocks of vaccine in case it is weaponised.
330 2018-08-27 21:00:34 Stocks are so liquid that you shouldn’t look at it like an expense at all, it’s just a transfer of funds now for a larger transfer back later (hopefully)
331 2018-08-27 21:00:15 Stocks jumped on Monday to record levels as the United States and Mexico closed a new trade deal.
332 2018-08-27 21:00:09 Stock drop: $HIIQ and 3 other stocks drop. The Common Wealth is investigating! Reach out for more info. TheCommonWealth.mail@gmail.com #StockDrop #HIIQ

336 2018-08-27 20:57:38 I was asked ‘Property or stocks?’  My take is long term property is safer- usually goes up and I don’t have time to gamble on stocks!
337 2018-08-27 20:57:06 lol, not one for shorting stocks, leave that to the big boys.  Often believe however that people who bet on sports are often shrooder than those on its fringe.  It's just too obvious how much market share Sky are going to lose at the present erosion rate of their offerings
338 2018-08-27 20:56:48 So you're a CEO who made so much more money you can buy up a bunch of stocks (artificially inflating market). (Deficit is rising because of tax cuts for rich-where's that chart?) I am an average American who owns no stocks. How does that help me?
339 2018-08-27 20:56:23 DJIA stocks that are off their ATH by a significant amount
IBM, GS, INTC, MCD, MMM, PG, TRV, WBA, WMT, XOM
The rest of the stocks are at ATH or nearby
340 2018-08-27 20:56:15 The rich and the corporations are buying stocks.  My paycheck  hasn’t gotten larger.
341 2018-08-27 20:55:25 tell me how many shares you have in what stocks
342 2018-08-27 20:55:00 Where do you all trade stocks ?
343 2018-08-27 20:54:12 Agreed, I’ve been reminding ppl of the worst Navy  by McCain 113 sailors killed. Broke flight pattern flys to low gets shot down bad pilot daddy got him the position. Careless Reckless.

345 2018-08-27 20:54:03 What highest risk.....trading stocks or Bitcpin?
346 2018-08-27 20:53:23 Fun with indexes: Nasdaq jumped 0.9% to a new high today, above 8,000. Yet only a handful of individual mega-tech stocks also made new highs, notably $AMD, $AMZN, $MOT and $NVDA. 

Former stars like $BABA, $FB, $NFLX and $TWTR are rallying but remain well off their 2018 highs.
347 2018-08-27 20:51:26 Weapons contractors stocks will never be the same.
348 2018-08-27 20:51:12 This rally in stocks was expected, but an all time high in small caps is really surprising so late in the bull market. More upside to come. $RUT

352 2018-08-27 20:49:55 We only tweet about stocks that we own and trade ( $TSLA $GBTC ) or if we see no brainers like $PZZA below $38 recently.  We also tweet about #Bitcoin levels to watch.
353 2018-08-27 20:49:23 $HEI big move A/H. Strength is usually followed by strength. Heico has been one of the strongest stocks in A&D $ITA $XAR $PPA $DFEN and continues to be.

NAFTA terminated 

New US-Mexico Trade Agreement

Canada and China excluded

Stocks at record highs

It's only Monday
355 2018-08-27 20:49:14 Stocks jumped on Monday as the United States and Mexico closed a new trade deal, potentially removing a source of uncertainty that had been plaguing investors for months.
356 2018-08-27 20:48:24 Good day but not great , just +1% . USD didn’t help , and average price $CRNO neither . Also negative $TWLO $PSTG ( profit taking ) but great the other stocks in my portfolio $YEXT $ROKU $ZUO $TNDM $PVTL. Let’s see what happens tomorrow with $CRNO , tomorrow AH $TRLY ER.

359 2018-08-27 20:48:06 Up the age to 21 unless hunting with the accompiment of an adult. Jess, does #1 include bump stocks?
360 2018-08-27 20:47:40 On Friday just 8% of the stocks in the $SPX rose to new highs.
361 2018-08-27 20:47:29 Exactly! Maybe we should have invested in Clearsil stocks instead. It might have partially paid for my college.  Thanks for the great input and laugh. Have a blessed day. 
362 2018-08-27 20:47:20 Croatia is a beautiful place.
363 2018-08-27 20:47:17 #numberoftheday: 8,017

That was the closing price of the Nasdaq on Monday, the first time that the tech-heavy index had topped the 8,000 mark. Stocks rose broadly after the White House said it has reached a preliminary agreement with Mexico on replacing NAFTA.
364 2018-08-27 20:46:12 Correct! Under Governor Rick Scott, only 38% of Floridians are shot.  Doing a bang up job!  Let’s all forget the promise to ban bump stocks now that time has passed.
365 2018-08-27 20:45:53 Really only effects people with stocks, does nothing for the economy... the stock market isn’t the economy.
366 2018-08-27 20:45:27 When Trump said the market would crash if he was impeached & people would be poor I laughed because he must think that everyone owns stocks! He has never lived paycheck-to-paycheck like most Americans.
367 2018-08-27 20:45:08 Why? They didn't take anything from me. It's not a zero sum game. Much of their wealth comes from paper gains on stocks. I invest too and so can you. And when I contribute as much value to my employee as their execs do, then I might have a complaint. I don't. And you don't.
368 2018-08-27 20:45:02 anyone here buying stocks in India ? Need some information...!

371 2018-08-27 20:43:39 Yawn. 
Back to my stocks
372 2018-08-27 20:42:58 U.S. Stocks rise to begin the week. Big bucks are being spent for back-to-school. Gas prices higher this Labor Day weekend than last year.
373 2018-08-27 20:42:50 U.S. stocks closed higher Monday,08/27/18: $DJIA +1.01% at 26,049.64, $SPX +0.77% at 2,896.74, $COMPQ +0.91% at 8,017.90, $RUT +0.16% at $1728.41.
374 2018-08-27 20:42:42 Central banks across the globe are printing money out of thin air and buying big US stocks.

That's what's propping up our stock market. 

Stocks down 14% on the world market.

All other indicators flat or down.

Meanwhile countries are shedding US treasuries.
375 2018-08-27 20:42:29 If you are not investing in stocks in Trump's era, you are crazy
376 2018-08-27 20:42:24 I see our stocks going up further.. Go #MUFC
377 2018-08-27 20:41:42 Bump stocks I agree should go away. No on semi's (most pistols and a lot of shotguns are semi's) , capacity is the issue.
378 2018-08-27 20:41:36 Laughing stocks of the league again, fuck off united, fuck off. #MUNTOT
379 2018-08-27 20:40:50 I am no longer investing in penny stocks. however i am applying the chart towards blue chip stocks.  Anyone like some advice or free analysis? SkinwalkerChart s really work and I'm excited to PROVE IT to you all.
380 2018-08-27 20:40:29 Limited edition! Only £120 and get a free ticket to the championship while stocks last!
381 2018-08-27 20:40:24 And to feed us, not just animals, it is a waste I agree, but you can't just blame people that eat meat, it's the corporations and governments that allow it to happen, I get my meat from a butchers that only stocks organically fed animals, so yes, you can't blame the end user.
382 2018-08-27 20:39:13 True. It seems like the stock is near the bottom
383 2018-08-27 20:38:56 And Dick Ed Woodward said we didn't need a centre half  Fuck off back to stocks and shares u pen pusher. #MUFC
384 2018-08-27 20:37:04 Stock Market at All-Time Highs While 72,000 Overdose Deaths in Country in 2017. Overdoses are not slowing down as opioids and heroin are killing the youth in the country. Celebrate that 401k though #Opioids #opioidcrisis #Trump #Congress #Republicans #WallStreet #Stocks
385 2018-08-27 20:36:56 Due to #Xrapid being in beta, partners of @Ripple who are set to use #Xrapid are under NDA. Remember "hypothetically speaking" If Xrapid fails or succeeds, people will sell/buy boat loads of $xrp. Stocks of the given company's would be highly volatile. Hence we want stability.
386 2018-08-27 20:36:36 All commercial agreements are contracts, if it isn't recognized as a Standard of Deferred Payment, it can't ever be a reserve asset. Example: imbeciles like Erdogan who's central bank stocks Gold.... Turkish debts don't settle in Gold. Also, Bitcoin is extremely small & illiquid
387 2018-08-27 20:34:38 Thank you, but the app reviews are nearly four years old. The Balance keeps my name on the articles but someone else updates the article so a fresher date appears. I don't agree with a lot of the reviews anymore. If I write about stocks apps, I'll keep Stock Live in mind.
388 2018-08-27 20:34:36 Just so we're clear on my stance:
1) I'd be very happy if ALL guns were banned, but would be okay with starting with assault/rapid fire weapons, bump stocks, etc.
2) I am VERY uncomfortable with the idea of ANY non-criminal label applied to a citizen that strips their rights.
389 2018-08-27 20:33:29 History repeats itself ever since the earth was created.. 
390 2018-08-27 20:32:50 Next Bear Market? That’s not gonna happen thanks to Mr.Trump! So, keep buying stocks!
391 2018-08-27 20:32:41 What analysis are you basing this on?
392 2018-08-27 20:32:21 Bruh, you are hopeful?
393 2018-08-27 20:30:41 China stocks coming back for what reason?
394 2018-08-27 20:30:27 Ban AR15s and guns like it, ban bump stocks, silencers, high capacity magazines.  Universal background checks for all sales including private, raise the minimum age to 21, red flag laws across the Country would be a good place to start.  Better mental health treatments too
395 2018-08-27 20:29:52 Hefty gains for big bank stocks today but not clear why. Playing catch-up?

MorganStanley $MS +3.6%
Goldman $GS +3.2
Citi $C +2.4
JPMorgan $JPM +1.8
BofA $BAC +1.4

vs S&P +0.8%
396 2018-08-27 20:29:43 You have to understand algorithms are our fiend, for those picking stocks. They took $TTOO down to $6 for no reason, and now they will probably take it to the sky for no reason. Needless to say I bought a boatload of shares close to the lows.

400 2018-08-27 20:27:41 Stock market...403b....and individual stocks...up 2000$ today even!
401 2018-08-27 20:27:32 I have a secret... if your buying weed stocks now.. your dumb and too late.

Millions won’t listen as greed and getting rich quick will be more overpowering but I can’t help but state the obvious... 

Remember crypto / bitcoin 2017? Ya.. $20k to 6k. History repeats itself.
402 2018-08-27 20:27:15 Rdc oblige... il fallait bien essayer de le vendre ce risotto . Au moins ils se donnent une chance d’écouler les stocks ....
403 2018-08-27 20:27:10 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $CMG, $UAA, $UA, $KSS, and $JWN.
404 2018-08-27 20:27:09 When ya stocks go up 
405 2018-08-27 20:26:46 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close higher on NAFTA deal as the S&P enters overbought state with caution.
406 2018-08-27 20:26:08 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $AMD, $GM, $TWTR, $KSM, and $APTV.
407 2018-08-27 20:25:07 My Mom deleted her music library from her phone, IDK how she did it, but it’s somehow my fault. She’s yelling and won’t listen to my instructions. I didn’t know you could even delete library, I thought it was like the stocks app. 
408 2018-08-27 20:25:01 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD, $GGP, $F, $BAC, and $GE.
409 2018-08-27 20:24:09 Investing my money in weed stocks is fucking awesome
410 2018-08-27 20:23:40 sector momentum is a real thing,  I did make money on $IGC today & ended the day green... I didn't take full advantage. My data shows that in this market over-night holds for listed stocks have a 50% win-rate. I did not want to chance it but the same time the weed sector is hot
411 2018-08-27 20:23:37 So...as long as we make $$ all is good? Nothing about this country or this life means anything compared to $$?  As we all know, stocks rise, fall, & sometimes crash. Right and wrong don’t change.
412 2018-08-27 20:23:11 @CNBCClosingBell #growth vs value. Are dividend stocks out of favor
413 2018-08-27 20:22:40 Stocks to watch:

$RGSE $CRON $OBLN $IGC $ATAI $LMFA $LTRX $CVM $TLRY $CGC $AWX $PIXY
414 2018-08-27 20:22:34 And I really don’t see a catalyst for bear action. There are definite short term opportunities on stocks that have overjumped.
415 2018-08-27 20:22:13 Between those crazy reversals in $NFLX $NVDA and somewhat in $TSLA, not to mention every software name, pot stocks, $AMD etc…it may have been the best trading week of the year last week
416 2018-08-27 20:22:12 I invested £1600 3 yrs ago using a stocks and shares ISA I’ve bought and sold various stocks sold some when high then bought sames ones when they dropped. At the moment probably sits at £1900. It’s a risk but it’s a long term game hope that helps
417 2018-08-27 20:21:35 I am a firm believer that you can abuse or take advantage of your rights. What citizen needs AK47s; automatic weapons, bump stocks. People do things because they can and sadly for things to change, or rationale to take place it has to become 'personal,' like involving a loss.
418 2018-08-27 20:20:05 Did you hold  Steven Harper accountable for selling GM stocks for under value just so he could balance his budget before the election, costing the country millions?

No? That’s what I thought.
419 2018-08-27 20:18:33 This is all for their stocks and shareholders to have a reason to make more guns and ammo to sell to those who are actually scared of a made up American civil/race war. Always ask yourself one things who profiting from issues they take on.
420 2018-08-27 20:17:52 World stocks higher on trade deal with Mexico: US +.8%; Europe +.5%. Trade euphoria was the day's story irrespective of the details, the issues of Senate passage, Canada missing or lack of real progress with China. Hopefully, it will all work out but the market will fall, if not.
421 2018-08-27 20:17:48 Again, why do you lie so much? Majority of ppl do not own stocks. Of those stocks owned, 35% are foreign interests. Of the 65% remaining over 83% of them are owned by 10% of the public. The top income ppl benefit. The deficit funded #GOPTaxScam created the next recession U moron!
422 2018-08-27 20:17:28 There will be a financial reset but stocks can (and most likely will) continue to skyrocket while that happens. Counterintuitive, I know.

When central banks fall apart, where does the big money go? Private sector. In a global world, that's probably going to be USA equities
423 2018-08-27 20:17:03 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your autism
424 2018-08-27 20:16:26 I gotta add some weed stocks to my roster. Prob drop a QP on the right ones
425 2018-08-27 20:16:24 The site you gave shows that at the same point in BHO's Presidency, stocks were up 25% while under #Trump are up 29%, so you're proving MY point, that #Trump is better for the economy than BHO was  When are YOU ready to deal with #facts?
426 2018-08-27 20:15:46 Finally, we see a new record high in markets like S&P500 and NASDAQ. Is @DowJones next? Maybe this week. 

#dowjones #market #stocks #money
427 2018-08-27 20:15:46 Though on that note, it probably won't be long till we have several "Uber..but for" in cannabis space operating with stocks from personal grow-ops, grey market etc for customers that cannot utilize mail (family dwellings) or wish not to pay OCS pricing.
428 2018-08-27 20:15:32 We were talking stocks and impact of a decline in stock market.  I pointed out decline in stock prices doesn't trigger recession.  You've disagreed since. Now to bolster your argument you are throwing in housing. A completely separate issue and one we agree on.
429 2018-08-27 20:15:23 Hell no! He is not doing a great job. He is just another corporate CEO, who looks out for the interest of his stocks, rather than the interests of the actual people is is charged to represent. Your endorsement should help get him out of office!

431 2018-08-27 20:14:45 McCain dies, stocks soar.
432 2018-08-27 20:14:37 Trump does deal with Mexico. Stocks at record highs!

Looks like Mexico really is going to 'pay for the wall!'

Jus'Sayin' ---- MAGA
433 2018-08-27 20:14:22 No chance of Trump impeachment as long as stocks are strong. Trump enemies will have to crash the markets if they want to oust him.
434 2018-08-27 20:13:58 It's been on my watchlist for the longest time and I owned it once before. Was shocked to see it so low, chart action would suggest it will get over $3 but need to do some DD
435 2018-08-27 20:13:47 They can't all be winners. $FOSL, $CMG and $UAA are the worst performing $SPX #stocks today.
436 2018-08-27 20:12:55 Norman I know you hate them but what about pot stocks now.Alcohol disrupter.Sticking there face in alcohol companies.Wait for big farma
437 2018-08-27 20:12:46 Are you in ?
438 2018-08-27 20:12:31 No I sold at 2.50 basically broke even   But not sure if it will hit 3 it’s such a slow mover. But if you have patience you never know.
439 2018-08-27 20:12:23 Too bad for those people. Talking so much crap about Trump when he's been keeping the stocks up keeping you money up and unemployment going down and illegals set straight since Congress made up the rules in 1925 when it was passed not Trump it's not like they cannot do it legally
440 2018-08-27 20:11:56 Trump appears to beat Mexico into submission on trade and Wall St cheers. Dow ends +259, +1.0% to 26,049.

Broad rally lifts Nasdaq and S&P to new highs, +0.9% and +0.8%, respectively. More bears throwing in the towel

Smaller stocks lag: Russell 2000 +0.1%, but still a new high.
441 2018-08-27 20:11:08 Wow just looked at my portfolio

444 2018-08-27 20:08:12 @Gbay99 Hey Gbay, how do you invest your money? Like, not strategy and crud, what is your process for physically buying stocks? Is there a website you use? A broker?
445 2018-08-27 20:06:40 Thank you for your continued dedication to this issue. Banning bump stocks, while great, doesn’t impact the majority of gun deaths. Most gun deaths are from suicides. Such a bill, if passed into law, would definitely complement our Extreme Risk Protection Orders law.
446 2018-08-27 20:06:04 $IMDZ most of other stocks are reaching new highs or making big moves and this simply ignores the positive vibes. frustrating
447 2018-08-27 20:05:00 Grains ended lower. #Cattle & #hogs rallied on US and Mexico trade news. US Dollar was lower. US stocks, Metals, Crude & #SP500 all  higher today.
448 2018-08-27 20:04:59 Bring back the stocks!
449 2018-08-27 20:04:04 I just wanna take a moment for the fact that I went from a boy who didn’t know how to use a microwave to one that successfully invests in stocks I am amazed every day lmao
450 2018-08-27 20:03:57 Messed up the $AMD short sell :/ which totally stinks cause had big size but overall good day. Still eye a lot of the weed stocks for downside this week. Would love to see $CVSI get hammered to buy some and "forget" about it
451 2018-08-27 20:03:43 Grains ended lower. #Cattle & #hogs rallied on US and #Mexico trade news. Dollar was lower. US stocks, Metals, Crude & S&P 500 all  higher today.
452 2018-08-27 20:03:41 S&P 500, Nasdaq jump to record highs as US and Mexico strike trade deal. Bull Market da Bears can’t find any honey . #Trading #Bullmarket #stocks

456 2018-08-27 20:03:03 Nothing makes me happier as an investor when someone bearish a stock I am bullish about (in this case $vtl) enlists someone to write a bash article that is filled with inaccuracies. Zero sum game! #stocks #stockstowatch $VTL #biotechnology

460 2018-08-27 20:00:04 You said to be cautious when jumping in, which I agree about the jumping in bit but definitely worth the risk of long exposure to ES with pre-determined loss point and time frame. Individual stocks look very good for a 'jumping in' point.
461 2018-08-27 20:00:00 yeah @MeBeOptic
462 2018-08-27 19:59:44 The stock market isn't the economy. A majority of US citizens don't participate in the stock mark, and don't benefit directly. As the old saying goes, stocks can go down as well as up.
463 2018-08-27 19:59:14 Not entirely. Selling 75% of shares at a decent gain.  Just nervous about the  Tweeter-in-Chief making some off-hand taunt of China which always hits their stocks. He has been distracted with Mexico and NAFTA. So, just playing the odds he'll blast China or Canada or EU tomorrow.
464 2018-08-27 19:59:10 You seem to miss the many attempts at laws and many of us try, but all the anti-gun crowd wants is to remove rights. ISRA (IL version of NRA) even was backing a bill for banning bump stocks. The anti-gun politicians didn't see it through, as it wasn't what THEY wanted.
465 2018-08-27 19:59:00 Going to get Lance Armstrong on to talk about pot stocks next
466 2018-08-27 19:58:28 How many private conversations do you listen to on a daily basis? Not many. How could the govt track these sales. Bump stocks are banned after parkland. Not that you can’t use a belt loop to imitate one. Most weapons are semi autos. They already control who can’t have one.

468 2018-08-27 19:56:52 I’m not interested in median stocks though. Oh, I forgot, everyone’s in market ETF’s. Never mind.
469 2018-08-27 19:56:27 Si la gent es guanyes a vida "dignament", no estaríem parlar d aquest tema. Però els sous (x qui te sort de treballar) estan x terra.
Exemple. La meva dona (no es meva..), treballa/porta uns fleca, sola. Neteja, stocks, caixa, aparador..etc ( com si fos seva), 
470 2018-08-27 19:55:47 I would support:
A) background check on all transactions (including private sales)
B) gun registry to track gun runners / gun stores
C) Ban bump stocks
D) Lean towards controlling ownership of semi-autos (full autos are already covered in 1968 gun control law)
471 2018-08-27 19:54:51 “Last 12 years, XRT (retail ETF) outperforms the S&P by 50% between Labor Day & end of November.” 

Retail stocks already been boomin the whole year. I’m finna cop

474 2018-08-27 19:54:18 My roommate invested in some crucial weed stocks, so this month he's going to pay me in totally legal weed money 
475 2018-08-27 19:53:55 Not hard at all. Get a few HF with billions - MC of $ostk 850 mil - easy to naked short & manipulate. Been in other battleground stocks & have gone through
Worse. This happens all the time unfortunately
476 2018-08-27 19:53:17 Every time I’ve thought about selling $NVTA over last couple of weeks, I’m glad I haven’t. However, stocks don’t usually continue up in a straight line forever. Ridden this rollercoaster before. LONG
477 2018-08-27 19:53:11 Bighit needs to make two new apps. A twitter but for bts, and a YouTube but for bts. Perhapsly then these shitty companies would lose stocks,
478 2018-08-27 19:52:53 Obama said these jobs qould never come back ...well they are coming back because all the decisioons trump made he says he can do it and he does it just today made a nafta deal with Mexico and stocks are going through the roof and so ais my 401 k
479 2018-08-27 19:52:49 @kroyrunner89 hi, quick question will your DVD help someone that has zero knowledge about penny stocks or stocks in general? Do you go clearly cover all the terminologys?
480 2018-08-27 19:52:40 I'll take "chaos" like 4.1% GDP, stocks up 40% since election, more jobs, record unemployment for blacks, hispanics, women, etc. any time over the < 2% GDP under BHO.  You DO know every 1% increase in GDP = $3TRILLION in added wealth to #USA economy, right? No, guess you don't.
481 2018-08-27 19:52:39 so you are admitting it has gun control laws in place. No automatics. No bump stocks. No one under 21. No felons or mentally ill. Must have a permit to conceal carry. What would you improve then
482 2018-08-27 19:51:52 Offcourse the gist is investment is spread over a 15year period and not too many pipo generally come up with an outright purchase option and inflation over a period of investment in building costs may also rise so your point about stocks has a good feel to it
483 2018-08-27 19:51:08 *stocks up on gin*
484 2018-08-27 19:50:52 Sold all out of $NEPT for an 8% gain. I think pot stocks need a breather.
485 2018-08-27 19:49:47 I don't even understand what is even on the screen other than stocks lmao.
486 2018-08-27 19:48:28 So fintwit is now all over pot stocks.... fukkn great

489 2018-08-27 19:47:28 You make solid points. I’ve always been a person that focus’ on my negatives because I’m so critical.

Naturally, I apply that to stocks, but I very much appreciate you pointing out to focus on our winners and their traits. If we don’t, we won’t remember what winners look like
490 2018-08-27 19:47:21 Why does everyone make a big deal about stocks being in record territory?  In a perfect world stocks would rise 10%/year and ALWAYS be in record territory.  Yes there will be losing days and years but they should be erased just as quickly.
491 2018-08-27 19:47:02 No one can beat Sandro in hand-picked stocks!
492 2018-08-27 19:46:52 Just go with the flow. Don't try to find reasons to exit this rally prematurely. Stocks like $ZS $ZUO $NTNX $TTD $AAPL $FNKO $CVNA can just go higher from here. Wait until the first high flyers violate the 10d MA before even thinking about the short side.

498 2018-08-27 19:44:41 It’s way too easy for these folks to gain access to weapons to harm themselves and others. There needs to be greater restrictions on things like bump stocks, semi automatics and other rapid-fire weapons.

501 2018-08-27 19:42:33 What other stocks, coins, or real estate do you like?
502 2018-08-27 19:41:51 I wish my stocks were guaranteed to go up like my weight
503 2018-08-27 19:41:11 That doesn’t explain lower job growth under Trump. Of course when you allow business to get away with exploitation of the citizenry and the environment, stocks will rise. Trickle down economics don’t work! That was already proven in the 80’s.

531 2018-08-27 19:22:48 Well I think then it would be best to restrict the sale of bump stocks to only military, and restrict/ban sales of all guns EXCEPT handguns to civilians.

Basically, military workers and soldiers would have more access to weapons, unfortunately... even they can go crazy.

648 2018-08-27 18:33:52 I dont believe March, 2009 was the low in stocks. The "internal/breadth" low was made in Nov, 2008.

Similarly, stocks as an asset class, have yet to make new ATHs. Many stocks, markets, still well below their peaks. Jan 2018 reeked of a blow-off top.

Open-minded but skeptical.

651 2018-08-27 18:32:36 Icon? History lesson McCain killed 113 sailors by dropping a bomb on deck worst fire in navy history. He broke flight pattern and flew to low and got shot down. He was a very poor pilot only because of his dad did he pass.
652 2018-08-27 18:31:04 Change stocks?... 
653 2018-08-27 18:30:47 If Powell's "dovish" speech is responsible for the rally in stocks, then why are interest rate futures pricing in an even greater probability of rate hikes in Sept and Dec and the 2Y yield nearing a 10-year high? All about #liquidity and who is providing it, not the narrative.

657 2018-08-27 18:29:53 Going on-air with @cherylcasone and @FoxBusiness to talk cryptocurrency mining, plus China tariffs, tech stocks and @Tesla.  Tune in 12:30pm Pacific.
658 2018-08-27 18:29:44 How do you identify stocks to trade - based on scan or watching for patterns on a few stocks you watch closely?
659 2018-08-27 18:28:16 I am expecting S&P 500 index to climb up to 2960 - 3000 range. That level should mark the end of wave 5 of 5. I have been leaning on the bullish side of US stocks so far but as we get closer to 3000 range I will begin to turn neutral to cautiously pessimistic.
660 2018-08-27 18:28:01 What's the value of the stocks I own?
661 2018-08-27 18:27:48 Cannibis stocks is the new crypto 
662 2018-08-27 18:27:31 I was looking at my stocks, one second I'm making money the next I'm losing it 
663 2018-08-27 18:27:17 I just hate when the big dow stocks suck all that money out the little stocks
664 2018-08-27 18:26:57 QE ended 4 yrs ago, QT started 1 yr ago, buyback stocks doing worse than other stocks, yet all US indices at ATHs and targeting 10-15% gains in 2018. Weird.
665 2018-08-27 18:26:22 Here is the schedule for Saturday-Pit opens at 1pm, Front Gate 4pm-qualifying at 4-4:30 (pure stocks, all American trucks), Racing heats starts approx 5:00-5:30. Racing at 6:30 all Divisions. Hope to see you here...a great exciting night, for sure!
666 2018-08-27 18:26:15 Selling my Twitter stocks today unacceptable
667 2018-08-27 18:26:00 It wasn't until you took office and started wheeling and dealing that my stocks took off. I never ever thought I would see my company stock this high again. Obama had absolutely nothing to do with it! You and Regan are the only two presidents I truly admire for your tenacity
668 2018-08-27 18:25:59 The fact that the NRA is against banning bump stocks is the only laughing stock here. It's also embarrassing that Congress did nothing. It should be pretty universally agreed that they need to be banned.

Stocks are up, poverty is down, and the U.N. has just declared Global Peace Forever.

Now, to the real news.         *Sigh*
671 2018-08-27 18:25:24 Sir this is about charts and finding multibaggers...i believe stocks talk only through charts..i talk with stocks only through charts and nothing else..
672 2018-08-27 18:25:16 I bet SM’s stocks would rise if F(x) came back too.
673 2018-08-27 18:23:40 This is just a bubble as of right now. I think Most of these stocks are gonna collapse in a year.
674 2018-08-27 18:23:29 Was down for the day, now I’m positive again, I fw stocks

677 2018-08-27 18:21:52 #US Late Afternoon: It's Auto stocks driving the records further, exuberant on NAFTA replacement deal with Mexico & its ramifications. Broker Ratings & Corporate announcements spurred activity in specific scrips. Defensive sectors↓ $SPX+0.71% $NASDAQ+0.82% $DJIA+0.97%. Yields↓.
678 2018-08-27 18:21:27 "Some years before his passing, Takeshi told me he'd made a 'wise investment'. I was so enamored with him at the time, I assumed he'd known what he was doing. Perhaps stocks or some such thing, I'd thought."
679 2018-08-27 18:21:20 Most of this is just plain nonsense. EG: stocks NOT at record highs, and approval is nowhere near 52% except in his deficient brain.
680 2018-08-27 18:21:18 MARKETS: U.S. stocks posting strong gains. S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting all-time highs, as US and Mexico reached a deal to replace NAFTA.
681 2018-08-27 18:21:04 U.S. Stocks rise to begin the week. Big bucks are being spent for back-to-school. Gas prices higher this Labor Day weekend than last year.

689 2018-08-27 18:18:53 My Twitter stocks went up. Keep up the good work guys! 
690 2018-08-27 18:17:47 there are more paid touts big and small than stocks to trade, so there's that
691 2018-08-27 18:17:00 If you can predict which stocks will have appreciated the most 10 years from now feel free to private message me!
692 2018-08-27 18:16:54 The S&P 500 (SPY) median Price to Free Cash Flow ratio is now 34.66. In other words, investors who are buying US stocks at the current price levels are valuing the typical large-cap company at almost 35 years worth of free cash flow

I repeat

**35 years worth of free cash flow**
693 2018-08-27 18:16:48 U.S. Stocks rise to begin the week. Big bucks are being spent for back-to-school. Gas prices higher this Labor Day weekend than last year.

698 2018-08-27 18:14:51 Hi just to let you know I submitted a monologue about mental health today (anxiety). Bittersweet women’s piece. @Tom_Stocks thanks
699 2018-08-27 18:13:48 Tell me who  soaring stocks benefit? Tell me how many days it will take to even pass this "deal"? Tell me how many days the current Mexican president will be in office? And then tell me the relationship between trump and the incoming Mexico president?

714 2018-08-27 18:08:20 Well! I don’t really know about this kind of numbers! In the last 10 years have never worked. If the markets are there, is because stocks are making money as never before
715 2018-08-27 18:07:47 Mark this tweet. Imo it's broke 2.00  threshold by mid september. 1.31 as we speak! $UPL $oil $energy $stocks
716 2018-08-27 18:07:25 I see on gap up many morning pressure traders on penny stocks go crazy and boast around , days like today make them feel invisible.
717 2018-08-27 18:06:54 $IGC now showing FAKE OFFERS so shorts can cover the bid

These pot stocks are going to the moon lol
718 2018-08-27 18:06:38 Definitely!  $AXXA is one of the few OTC stocks that has potential to uplist in the future.  I've been looking forward to the next Q.

721 2018-08-27 18:04:25 Haven't seen any reason given by 'mainstream media' for stocks being 'sharply higher'-  Couldn't be the new NAFTA agreement, since ALL of them predicted economic 'disaster' (like 'climate' and 'environmental' disaster) under this President.  Maybe they'll figure it out...  MAYBE.
722 2018-08-27 18:04:00 When you block 99% of promoted tweets advertisers as I do, you eventually begin to see some weird shit like supplements and gold stocks.
723 2018-08-27 18:03:53 Three things I look for when purchasing pot stocks:
1- Strong management team that has had success in other endeavours.
2-A company with monster deals that haven’t come into play yet.
3-A company that is cheap enough to own a lot of shares.
$CANN.C $CANN checks these boxes. 
724 2018-08-27 18:03:05 but Katy you realize all stocks are made with mirepoix
725 2018-08-27 18:02:44 dude u literally dumped penny stocks on people. GTFO
726 2018-08-27 18:02:31 before investing in weed stocks.....beware of the promoters guyssss
727 2018-08-27 18:02:16 Ugh. Stocks.
728 2018-08-27 18:01:42 US companies with the biggest stocks buy-back programs are under-performing in the S&P 500.

729 2018-08-27 18:01:25 Thank you for sharing and loved what you said about people forgetting the past, no matter how good the quality we can pay only that much, n expensive stocks will underperform eventually and come back to normal valuations. Thank you...
730 2018-08-27 18:01:16 $IGC now a crowded short and near HOD... crazy these pot stocks
731 2018-08-27 18:01:09 Don’t have to do anything. Stocks dropping on its own.
732 2018-08-27 18:00:59 When ppl say to add on dips what do you do if you don’t get your original price as stocks like baj finance are really good. Pls advise
733 2018-08-27 18:00:55 Mutual fund & FIIs holding in these stocks over the years are sufficient to prove my point. Size & status doesn't imply performance. One's past may be glorious, present may be lackluster & future may be bleak....may sound arrogant but very true both in life & business
734 2018-08-27 18:00:40 كلك حكم للامانة
735 2018-08-27 18:00:09 Not back home. hospital privileges/stocks are worth hundreds of thousands to millions. Then monthly rent for a clinic space. Then build up your patient base for years unless you have monopoly. Plus your student loans. Money comes to some way later but not to all
736 2018-08-27 18:00:03 Selling all my stocks!
737 2018-08-27 17:59:44 NO. Are background checks, no bump stocks & semi-automatics and age 21 to purchase a handgun TAKING AWAY GUNS? By the way, I know LOTS of Democrats who OWN GUNS, even permits to carry concealed weapons. STOP trying to divide AMERICANS.
738 2018-08-27 17:59:27 I wish someone would investigate stock sales & purchases by Trump and his family/friends when he decides to announce tariffs (stocks down) to then announcing new deals (stocks spike). Issues seem fabricated for another purpose. #tradewar #NAFTA @voxdotcom @NewsandGuts
739 2018-08-27 17:58:51 @RobinhoodApp @AskRobinhood please I have sent you a mail and I need to withdraw my stocks as I am leaving the country. Please help. It's very important
740 2018-08-27 17:58:50 The series 7 broadens the scope of the 6 to be able to sell things like stocks and bonds. It’s still just a license and does not allow you to charge for planning. The series licenses are governed by FINRA and focus very much on transactions, not fiduciary advice.
741 2018-08-27 17:58:24 Good Afternoon @PowerLunch @JoeSquawk @jimcramer #tennis #MadMoney #golf #stocks. I was trying to find a comparison for the stock market and the resurgence of head to head big sports tournaments and this now reminds me of the big $$$ skins games back in 2000

744 2018-08-27 17:58:09 I’ve been playing it safe as far as trading few weed stocks REITS and a few things that pay dividends but can’t deny those returns on options
745 2018-08-27 17:57:49 never sell $tsla stocks
746 2018-08-27 17:57:08 -Upping legal age to 21 nationally?
-More/improved background screening?
-Restrictions for those convicted of domestic violence?
-Mandatory extensive training and certification processes? 
-Ban on bump stocks and any accessories that help a gun mimic full-auto?
747 2018-08-27 17:56:50 Kindly suggest 5 stocks for 15 years in sip..

749 2018-08-27 17:55:03 Dang, should bought into those weed stocks.
750 2018-08-27 17:54:56 37% of the S&P 500’s YTD performance of +6.5% (total return) through 7/31/18 was driven by just 3 tech stocks in the index.
751 2018-08-27 17:54:29 Change "when" to "if." Respectfully, I wouldn't know how to invest in the businesses you just described. Re retail, Lynch, who loved growth stocks, wouldn't invest in hyper earnings growth (>25%). Highly unpredictable; usually Wall Street darlings; usually high premiums.

757 2018-08-27 17:52:11 I convinced my child that if he's going to invest, diversifying is good and maybe one or two CDs would be great in addition to stocks. Kid just asked "is 8 grand OK to put in?" JESUS CHRIST, KID, MAKE WITH THE BIRTHDAY PRESENTS! :o

759 2018-08-27 17:51:27 regardless, church and state are to be kept separate. so why does the church feel the need to beg everyone to vote no? because they own more than 80% in pharmaceutical stocks and are 1.3 billion dollars invested into pharmaceutical companies.

762 2018-08-27 17:51:10 When the Dept of BLS says wages are down & inflation is up, healthcare costs , please explain to us how wealth is expanding for the avg American? ~50% don’t owe stocks. We know the majority of tax cut benefits went to corps/rich & the big raises never happened.
763 2018-08-27 17:50:55 Been hearing about cannabis stocks for a minute but haven’t educated myself nearly enough on it. Gonna do a deep dive soon.
764 2018-08-27 17:50:54 Its called support you silly boy. Love the deal being made with Mexico. Stocks at 26k again. America best since WW2 but keep hating. Hopefully alone soon
765 2018-08-27 17:50:45 I've legitimately met Wyoming ranchers who need guns to fend off wild animals, and there are still people who hunt for food, so an outright ban is overkill. But all of those people would be fine without:
High capacity magazines
Assault-style rifles
Bump stocks
Semi-automatic fire

771 2018-08-27 17:48:43 Which stocks you looking at?
772 2018-08-27 17:48:22 Source please that it is the primary reason. I have only seen that he just left and no info about future occupation. And evin if you have a source and it is true (so far doubtful) their stocks are falling quite badly so the company did get hit by their bad decisions.
773 2018-08-27 17:48:20 I definitely agree with you on the US dollar...
Gonna have to think about the stocks angle...
But I follow you because you seem to have a good handle on things, and have very good comments, so, food for thought...   Thank you..
774 2018-08-27 17:47:32 And yet the man cited in the article admits that he doesn’t know if he owns stocks. He does - he has a 401K.

776 2018-08-27 17:46:25 This wasn’t directed towards you at all @savvannasmiles, it was just a general statement that is true about this whole crazy situation. It wasn’t meant for calling you out or anything. Just so you know 
But it’s the truth, it has a lot to do w the churches stocks.

781 2018-08-27 17:45:04 Mexican trade deal almost done.  Stocks love it and we're seeing an "outside" day in T-bonds on the day chart.  A close below Friday's range would provide a technical sell signal and all the shorts will be toasting champagne.  Some of you  took a nice profit out of a cheap put!

810 2018-08-27 17:32:14 The "4 horsemen" of 1999 were all profitable, but overvalued, much as the FANG stocks are today. There was hyped unprofitable junk then,  as there is today (TSLA, most cloud stocks, most small biotech).
811 2018-08-27 17:32:14 Why would we want something that is classified into the same category as heroin, LSD, ecstasy, and meth by the DEA to not be provided through a licensed pharmacy?

It has nothing to do with the church’s stocks. That’s just an excuse to try and have someone to blame.
812 2018-08-27 17:32:11 I people who own food stocks also own BIG PHARMA stocks.  So, they force us to buy and consume toxic foods so we can get sick and need drugs to stay alive.  The investors do very well with portfolio valuations.

816 2018-08-27 17:31:25 I'm just saying, if two strategies (long the index vs. buy stocks that exhibited high momentum) are identically similar to execute, there should be no reason, ex ante, to presume that one will do better than the other one on a risk adjusted basis over time.

840 2018-08-27 17:20:46 Using the drawdown chart is a must when looking at any tech stocks, reveals a lot of secrets. Most won't look at the DD for stocks like these though, imo these sort of stocks rely on herding more than anything else.
841 2018-08-27 17:20:30 I have a personal theory that it might be third time lucky for AIM.  1) AIM hit a new low after the dot-com bust 2) AIM also hit a new low after the mining boom and during the financial crisis 3) The large AIM stocks now look reasonable quality to me.  AIM finally matures?
842 2018-08-27 17:19:42 Just revisiting this old nonsense.  As always I was 100% spot on. I knew for a fact that Ekejija was a fraud, and that Johnson was nothing but a washed up ex-footballer who had no business dabbling in penny stocks.

846 2018-08-27 17:17:28 welp... let's see what happens to my stocks after this
847 2018-08-27 17:16:56 Disastrous decision? Deplorable? American stocks are already responding very positively, as are stock markets in Mexico. This is a win-win for both countries
848 2018-08-27 17:16:21 Get it now, while stocks last.
849 2018-08-27 17:16:17 I mean you could say that about anything though. The utility companies taking money from investors to pay their bills, the dividend for their homes, the tolls on highways, they all take money... It’s just a cost of doing business like you’d pay a broker to trade stocks for you
850 2018-08-27 17:15:14 “Most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can’t buy what is popular and do well.” - Warren Buffet...

854 2018-08-27 17:14:46 I can see both sides.  AIM is where the lower quality companies will list and so you need to be able to be discerning.  Premium listed main market stocks have to follow certain corporate governance rules.  But there are good stocks on AIM.  Look for management ownership.
855 2018-08-27 17:14:45 The guns are currently at the smiths having the stocks lengthened. Going to chase them tomorrow so I can get some practice in with them!

914 2018-08-27 16:54:24 Bull markets are low-correlation markets of stocks. Corrective markets are high-correlation stock markets -most stks sink and rise in tandem
915 2018-08-27 16:54:11 Thanks for your suggestions, Simon. Please note the quotes of the equities and CFD stocks are displayed in the official currency they are traded in, depending on the relevant stock exchange.
916 2018-08-27 16:54:02 It's mostly retail $ pumping those stocks with little to no REV let alone profits.
917 2018-08-27 16:53:33 Shiller PE 33.30. Stocks have never been cheaper. Get in now!
918 2018-08-27 16:52:34 Wonder how much of the company he owns? Stocks?
919 2018-08-27 16:52:34 I get your point, but a pop in the bubble in bonds (CB-induced) would HAVE to have a very serious negative effect on stocks as well, no?
920 2018-08-27 16:52:14 Oil and gas stocks only represent a small fraction of the overall fund. But what I find more interesting is whether these oil derived sovereign funds can last, surely they’ll be picked off for climate mitigation in years to come?
921 2018-08-27 16:52:13 Not at all worried!
Stocks are up
Wages are up
Job demand remains strong
Farming remains strong

This is all CHINA HYPE !!!
922 2018-08-27 16:50:52 Stocks doing numbers ..... it’s only Monday though so I’m not getting to happy I know how this shit get.
923 2018-08-27 16:50:48 $SPX #stocks up the most so far today $MOS, $GT, $GM, $DLPH, $INCY, $BWA
924 2018-08-27 16:50:39 Except that he didn’t cheat and is the best thing to happen to this country for a long time. Stocks,unemployment, jobs, etc.
925 2018-08-27 16:50:30 Aisha is a siren who trades stocks on the weekends.
926 2018-08-27 16:50:10 I love when pot stocks rip because that means everyone I interact with on twitter is making $$$ also don’t miss $CPO
927 2018-08-27 16:49:54 But trickle down doesn’t work.  They buy back stocks and stuff more $ into the Cayman Islands out of American circulation
928 2018-08-27 16:49:43 @HalftimeReport #askhalftime What's the deal with Cannabis Stocks? I picked up 2000 shares of $IGC for .6999 look at it now!
929 2018-08-27 16:49:07 The stocks, the economy, the Real State are doing great. @POTUS is helping the victims of tragedies. Be grateful to @realDonaldTrump.
930 2018-08-27 16:49:04 To sum up:

NAFTA terminated 

New US-Mexico Trade Agreement

Canada and China excluded

Stocks at record highs

It's only Monday
931 2018-08-27 16:48:18 if you have stocks in the market, give the $ back. If you have a kid in the military, bring them awol. If you ever said anything remotely locker room talk, go apologize to all and wash ur mouth out with soap.
932 2018-08-27 16:47:34 On verra, en tout cas ça fait déjà 2 semaines que les stocks sont stables et le prix baisse petit à petit…
933 2018-08-27 16:47:10 You mean the fishing industry that devastated the fish stocks, then the government sold off our quotas to neighbouring countries? That fishing industry?
934 2018-08-27 16:46:39 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your carpal tunnel syndrome
935 2018-08-27 16:46:38 Lol I feel like I got 2 J since I started doing stocks constantly
936 2018-08-27 16:46:24 Tough to approximate (I keep buying), but using the 6 stocks I hold, it has significantly surpassed devaluation and inflation over that 2-year period.
Returns > 30% p/a
937 2018-08-27 16:46:22 Your original non-NAFTA prediction was that if @realDonaldTrump won, the US economy would tank, we would be in a recession, etc.  Today stocks (again) at record highs, unemployment at record lows.  
938 2018-08-27 16:46:16 If he's ever convicted of anything, I'd be OK with him serving the maximum sentence in the public square in stocks. The public allowed to throw rotten tomatos at him during daylight hours.

Maybe on the Washington National Mall.

942 2018-08-27 16:45:33 @federalreserve Chair Jay Powell spent 5 paragraphs of his @JacksonHole speech on Friday explaining why Alan Greenspan was right to keep rates low from 1995 to 1999. If you want to know why US #stocks rallied to fresh highs on his talk, that’s pretty much all you need to know.
943 2018-08-27 16:45:30 Trading Cannabis stocks and Crypto have set the bar on excitement so high, that once they settle down life won't be the same.
944 2018-08-27 16:45:25 And are bump stocks?
945 2018-08-27 16:45:25 Trump did Not set anything.
It is an economic mistake because the stock market does not directly matter to the 48 percent of Americans who do not own stocks directly or indirectly through a mutual fund. ... Presidents have a limited and very indirect effect on stock markets.

947 2018-08-27 16:45:15 @garyvee Few Americans realize how much money can be on Canadian smallcap stocks. Unlike USA OTC that is loosely regulated, Canada was built for startup stocks and offers the ability to "lose small, win big" (from one of the small firms in "The Big Short") under great regulation

952 2018-08-27 16:44:02 Careful everyone. Paul has no idea what he's talking about when it comes to economics. If you had listened to him after Trumps election and sold all your stocks, you would have missed one of the biggest bull markets in history. Paul is a bought and paid hack.
953 2018-08-27 16:43:51 En este gobierno no pueden hacer nada, los stocks se puden con tiempo 2 o 3 meses antes de q se termine, pero seguro dejan q se agoten PARA Q LUEGO SEA URGENTE, NO PASA GUATE COMPRAS NI LICITACION Y ROBAN A MANOS LLENAS

959 2018-08-27 16:42:09 @RobinhoodApp One of the greatest improvements I can suggest is to add another column to the accounts tab on Robinhood web.  The column would show the total return as a percentage. That way when someone is looking to lower the average cost of down stocks it would be a lot easier.

973 2018-08-27 16:34:46 Article was twisted. Facts weren't straight. Timing was odd. That's why we came at Naver. As for YG: yes, he's a dick (u're a Blink, u can't say he isn't) & he does have stocks in Naver now, and dislikes RBW's CEO. They share a past. 
Doesn't mean he's behind this tho, I agree.

976 2018-08-27 16:33:57 Sound leadership, you must work either be blind or work in the industry because you know better than to choose stocks on that criteria
977 2018-08-27 16:33:19 So what do bump stocks do then,Stephen paddocks guns were modified and enabled him to fire up to 9-10 rounds per second,magazines could hold 100 rounds,I agree with a lot of what you’re saying,but common sense has to prevail eventually.

1036 2018-08-27 16:08:13 No. You are wrong. Any R pres would have achieved same fiscal policy result. Potentially even better (i.e. someone less polarizing). Yes, I know how stocks work. I'm curious if you do? Also, your condescension is quite off-putting. Especially from a guy calling himself "Sparky".

1038 2018-08-27 16:07:34 No matter how high US stocks get, they're guaranteed to go higher if you ask ~ 95% of market participants. I don't need to ask them bc price has answered it. 
Follow the trend bc it's your friend is what they'll say. Yep trend can't end, so you must buy & pay whatever they ask.

1044 2018-08-27 16:05:35 just look at stock market if you democrat socialists want to see what is in the details.  How the market reacts tells you a lot.  If you hate it lead by example and donate all your 401k, stocks, raises, lower prices and any monetary gain you have received since Trump was elected.
1045 2018-08-27 16:05:32 #BREAKING: Stocks rally as the U.S. and Mexico reach a new trade deal. Trump says Canada can join if they want. #NAFTA is gone, the new United State, Mexico Trade Agreement. Dow is at a session high.  26,046 up 257 points that's a little over 1%.

For the Homeless Mobile Run

Stocks are at an all time low, so I  am appealing for the following items 

Tents
A 4 man tent
Sleeping bags 
Men’s underwear and socks 
Toiletries 
Dog food (wet and dry)
Crisps, biscuits and chocolate bars 
Bottles of water
1047 2018-08-27 16:05:01 Stocks go up because they can

“Momentum”
1048 2018-08-27 16:04:37 Achieving new trade deals will be incredibly helpful for continued stock market growth.  This is a big first step.

1052 2018-08-27 16:03:54 Yea,Ben you’re 100% wrong.  My business is directly related to the economy and I’m up 30%. Regulation cuts and tax cuts improve earnings.  You do know how stocks work right?  If you factor in Nov 2008 when Obama was elected the mkt went up 9% per year. Good, but not like this.

1118 2018-08-27 15:38:06 That's smells a bullshit. What does a trade agreement have to do with tech stocks. And they're hoping to sell something to Mexico? You know what I'm getting sick of having all this bullshit run down my neck. I suspect Bret Baier stock going up that's why he likes it.
1119 2018-08-27 15:38:01 Stocks are Hot and Bonds are Not!  Stocks are up (DOW over 200) on news that US and Mexico have struck an agreement over NAFTA.  MBS is down 8bps and Yields have risen to 2.85%.  There's no economic data to report today.

1153 2018-08-27 15:29:07 I mean if you're talking investing? I don't know if it's a great entry. For a trade? The market has seen tech stocks hit ATHs recently, NFLX looks like it bottomed out, and is coming back up. I don't really get any vibe that bears are liking this action.

1159 2018-08-27 15:27:22 Good afternoon,

Most exchanges we offer will have a fee composed of a base rate plus a variable percentage. For the UK and Canada, the fee is a base rate plus a variable cost per share. This means that the cost for stocks which trade for just a few cents will be more expensive.
1160 2018-08-27 15:27:14 this thing has been a monster all week - whole market on fire - days like today are the worst for me - stocks at ATH - I like to buy low sell high...so theres not much to buy here $CGC is already run 47

I have my doubts? 3rd wave solely due to 10 odd stocks?
1242 2018-08-27 14:54:53 If only the stock market actually mattered to the financial well being of average people. A rising stock market primarily helps the 10% of people who own 84% of stocks. The other 90% are catching crumbs (the remaining 16%) or are not invested. Who’s winning? Rich people.

1292 2018-08-27 14:38:59 Good afternoon,

The cost to trade US stocks is €0.50 + $0.004 per share. The current share price is approximately $0.02 per share so if you purchase 10,000 shares, please be aware that the cost can increase much more than for a stock which trades at say $1-$10 per share.

1341 2018-08-27 14:26:00 Not really. It's better to buy as much as you can afford. Make sure you research first.  Weed stocks are booming because Canada is legalizing it oct 17th and a company invested $4 billion into the weed market.  This the best time to jump on it.
1342 2018-08-27 14:25:48 The fishing industry peaked in 1950, then the Cod Wars. Fact is the fish stocks were running out. Without the CFP there would be no fish at all. @grahambsi

1346 2018-08-27 14:25:31 -Its not just witch time alone
-risk/reward is heavily skewed
-No one is saying there isn't actual counterplay, but see above

1494 2018-08-27 13:44:51 Pot stocks heating up more. Shorting is always tough in a bull market but the obvious over extended ones are good candidates. I wouldn't touch the ones with great catalysts. Going long on dips seems to be the best play then selling on strength.

(2) EU Block was divided on 3 group after UK Committed to finish all negotiation on November this year...
1679 2018-08-27 12:38:14 But isn’t It super inflated?

1691 2018-08-27 12:32:28 Short $CRON very small to build into winner on the off chance i might have caught the top. Very ready to cut it for a small loss but when stocks parabolic like CRON its often the beginning of the end.
1692 2018-08-27 12:32:21 Global stocks push higher after Fed's Powell reassures - Washington Post
1693 2018-08-27 12:32:08 You obviously believe lies, tariffs take guts, and they are working, china is our obama built enemy, unemploy among minoritys is lowest, dems never cared, inc obama bin laddin, trump has stocks at record highs, obama sain indust will never come back cause he thought he ruined it
1694 2018-08-27 12:30:03 $SPY trades more each day than of the stocks it holds too. Better measure IMO is the ETF $ vol as a % of total $ vol in that market. My guess is $LQD is <10%.
1695 2018-08-27 12:29:51 $TWTR is UP +$0.30 in the premarket. Who is trading $TWTR these days? This stock doesn't move enough to waste time on trading. There are stocks that are moving enough to give an greater Profit. If you have this stock on your watchlist? Time to trim that list
1696 2018-08-27 12:29:04 @Roebearinvests @GordonGekkoo1K to me it makes no sense to short stocks that make chips for gaming...holiday is around the corner..whatever
1697 2018-08-27 12:28:39 So true!

Like 2016, 2008 didn't phase me, made coffee as I watched the stock market plunge. Made mental note to by stocks that would be under valued.

Enjoyed the sunrise!

This liberal meltdown is Hillary-ous,

Those that can, Do!

1700 2018-08-27 12:27:24 Menos mal, es que me di cuenta de que con 2 stocks había muy poca chance de comback y en cuánto uno cogía la primera, el combate para mí perdía bastante chicha porque casi siempre se decidía por este comienzo (aunque hay ejemplos que no, obviamente) pero meh D:

1712 2018-08-27 12:23:15 Personally against term limits but do understand the idea behind them.

Biggest thing to do would be prevent or limit MPs ability to own stocks in companies and prevent them going into private lobby jobs once they leave office.

Keep their interest in the job, not the one after.

1759 2018-08-27 11:55:05 Agreed. Def. Support around 13. But maybe correction needs to happen from 17-20 ? Hard with undervalued small cap stocks
1760 2018-08-27 11:53:49 (2/2)
Then which one is better ?

When you have corpus of 1 Lakh, MFs are best. 
When you have corpus of 10 Lakh, MFs are better. 
When you have corpus of 1 Crore, Stocks are better.
When you have corpus of 10 Crore, Stocks are the best.
1761 2018-08-27 11:53:37 (1/2)
Mfs Vs Stocks is very long debate. 

Assumptions:
But I would give some pointers with certain assumptions.
1. You are investing in direct mfs with expense ratio of 1.5%
2. Your advisory fees are capped max. at 50,000 PA
3. Your MFs and Stocks generated same returns
1762 2018-08-27 11:53:19 Housing down 4 quarters, get ready for the downward fall.  The stock market is not the indicator of how we are doing, it shows that corp. are buying back their stocks.
1763 2018-08-27 11:52:59 It's totally depende on when you took position... For those who bought stocks btwn 2013-16 long term was good. For 2017-2018 entrant still good but holding period will be long(Bad)

1894 2018-08-27 10:00:27 They are muscle powered. But maybe u can help with a name: when a retailer stocks a super expensive item, the real purpose is to sell more mid-market items. In this case, I refused to spend $229 but did spend $55, not $20 as intended. Wine lists work the same. This is called?
1895 2018-08-27 09:58:42 Actually, year 1 @realDonaldTrump realdondid nothing that effected the economy. Then "tax cuts" go into effect, big companies buy back stocks. He calls for tariffs,  big rush to trade before they start - bumps GDP for 1 quarter.

3) Are you handling only futures or options too?

2190 2018-08-27 04:45:26 Oh no, that is not how that works at all. The amount of money spent going through R&D, trials, and FDA approval is obscene. That's why the pharma stocks have huge swings during the trial process.

2193 2018-08-27 04:40:49 I had a coworker who with her husband had lots in the stockmarket that she was quite smug about compared to us working slubs.

2195 2018-08-27 04:38:52 Note: Trading idea was recommended pre-market (before the market opens), but meant for entering once the market opens.

Only low volume stocks open at bumper low/high, can always avoid them.

Stock Futures with good volume will normally give opportunity for entry/exit.

2203 2018-08-27 04:31:00 It's cute how poor ppl care about "the economy"  someone should tell them that when you're too poor to afford a portfolio of stocks cuz you work paycheck to paycheck the Dow doesn't effect you.  Just rich ppl getting richer.

2294 2018-08-27 03:26:19 Yep, you have to make a hole for their head to go through. Using a scissors. This creates like, a garter, so the stocks stay on their body. It's hard to explain without visuals. maybe I'll make a video.
2295 2018-08-27 03:25:44 Don’t play the woman card Tina!Blind loyalty to a party or a gender is dangerous to our democracy. So is making millions off medical device stocks like you are. Also poisoning our land and water is dangerous for people in Minnesota, which you are trying to do with polynet

2298 2018-08-27 03:22:58 It's going to be very interesting to see how #cobalt pricing plays out medium-longer term. Everything indicates it will soar, and I don't see much supply coming on line. Still the #ASX isn't pricing any upside into cobalt stocks so one side of this situation is wrong.

2301 2018-08-27 03:21:09 $/lb is rough guideline. Was attempting to give reason why FCU down and other U stocks up. Ultimately cash flow will be based on sales of U, regardless of grade. U is U...high grade might reduce mining cost, but won’t earn more $/lb sold. Grade matters, but total asset wins.
2302 2018-08-27 03:18:39 Yes, sa amin kasi savings are under investments! Put money into investments (real estate, stocks, that shoebox under your bed, etc), then spend what you need and if you have some left over, I suggest "saving" it to use for next month's investments  Gulo lang ng delivery namin!!

2311 2018-08-27 03:16:15 Protip: Extremely fast growth of the stock market means bubble economy, not SUPER MEGA ULTRA GOOD ECONOMY.
Speculation on soaring stocks immediately preceded the crash of  1929.
2312 2018-08-27 03:14:41 I keep asking people how this big great economy has helped them,the usual thing I hear is 401ks and stock market. But I'm no idiot,I can always figure out that most are unemployed or min.wage earners,that couldn't buy stocks or 401k r out of the question.
2313 2018-08-27 03:13:11 I’m glad for your business. I can see how you could believe it’s positive everyplace. I know Tariffs impacted other businesses in farmers and more. Watch your stocks, it’s coming.

2317 2018-08-27 03:07:33 we've already had that when capitalists had to adjust their business model from the globalist ($HRC) to the nationalist (#trump).... 

yes, stocks will likely take ANOTHER adjustment period as they move BACK to the globalist capital business model.

2320 2018-08-27 03:06:12 U.S. Market Check
U.S. stocks dropped and the dollar rallied the most in two weeks as the trade dispute with China showed no signs of easing. Commodities sank.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose one basis point to 2.82 percent.

2323 2018-08-27 03:04:52 However I agree bumb stocks were an idiotic idea. Like it uses the recoil to make it perfectly resemble a fully automatic. I don't know why obama signed them as legal.

2326 2018-08-27 03:02:11 The bigger picture...what is your solution to the gun problems we have in America? Bump stocks are just one issue of the bigger picture. And the families of the victims of Las Vegas would disagree of your assessment that they are not a problem.

2335 2018-08-27 02:55:03 Have you ever listened to any PC political figure after a mass shooting? It might not sound like they want to be guns in an instant but they are slowly doing it for example suppressors are how illegal to buy in a few states l, same goes for bump stocks.
2336 2018-08-27 02:55:00 A tip to make you money: there are two states of the economy/markets,
(1) when govt’s share of GDP is rising and (2) and when it’s falling.

When (1) is true, official market expectations -> disappointment 

When (2) is true, expectations -> happy surprises. 

Buy stocks!

2415 2018-08-27 01:52:31 Anybody else hoping cannabis stocks has another day like Friday
2416 2018-08-27 01:51:43 Las Vegas - high ammunition, bump stocks
Lexington Park - father's gun
Newtown - mother's gun
Townville - father's gun (in nightstand)
Columbine - unlicensed sellers
Countless toddlers - unsecured guns
2417 2018-08-27 01:51:26 Most of us don’t have stocks. You live in an entitled dream world, don’t you?
2418 2018-08-27 01:50:18 Donald Trump lies about matters of life&death. 

@realDonaldTrump
I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!

2420 2018-08-27 01:49:26 Stocks investments business ideas and planned trips... yeah boys been busy
2421 2018-08-27 01:48:38 The companies themselves are reporting this. Look, I'm an NRA life member and have been since 1986 but I'm OUT of firearms stocks in my 401K. They're doing badly & they're a bad investment. But by all means, invest YOUR money in them. I sure won't waste my money on these stocks.
2422 2018-08-27 01:48:02 How does one report this as a probably Russian Bot account? Immigration is not keeping wages low. Corporations that got a huge tax break & are using those savings to pay their executives more & buy back their own stocks instead of paying workers more are.
2423 2018-08-27 01:47:48 Buying gold & silver.  Stocks will crash
2424 2018-08-27 01:46:51 Bump stocks weren't used in Parkland.  The Parkland students, sadly, don't know what they are talking about.

What kind of stocks are you interested in?
2428 2018-08-27 01:44:53 The Dow is down during Obama 27000 during Trump 25000 so let's not lie about how great the stocks are.
2429 2018-08-27 01:43:02 READ! Please.The corps are owned by people.They did not pass on any of the money they made to employees. They bought back stocks which made them even richer -complete opposite of what they assured America was happening. Middle class tax cuts are temporary: rich people -permanent.
2430 2018-08-27 01:42:38 I wouldn't be surprised, especially after reading how the stocks went up for BigHit.
2431 2018-08-27 01:41:14 Everyome who pushed “F” is currently checking their stocks. Lmao
2432 2018-08-27 01:40:34 Being in a twitter thread with you is like being locked in the stocks, so I'm all set anyway thanks.
2433 2018-08-27 01:38:52 Lol thank you. Couldn't afford telecommunication stocks for them yet. Lowe's is more affordable for me at this time. Love y'all. Your work is not in vain. In fact Sirius Xm 126 urban view is no joke. Great information all day and weekend. Greatest station in the galaxy.
2434 2018-08-27 01:38:25 I always tell people, think of stocks as owning part of a business, rather than just as tickers to trade up and down. 25 likes on this post and I'll tweet 10 things I evaluate about a business before I buy stocks in it.
2435 2018-08-27 01:36:33 We can put our energy into both. CLEARLY YouTube views matter if their stocks rise. They gettin money. I think we need to stress more on paid platforms but we can’t just forget about this one
2436 2018-08-27 01:36:32 Bump stocks is literally the least we can do. And that is only being done at the state level...so, collectively, no, we aren’t doing anything.
2437 2018-08-27 01:35:35 When making your investment decisions - remove your own biased-history repeats itself-money&power always wins-even when it looses,another is born-"Follow the Money-it doesn't change your views-just your pocket- #trading #stocks #bitcoin #crypto #blockchain #cryptocurrency $btc
2438 2018-08-27 01:35:20 Also, if you are in a group of leading stocks, the specific stocks are largely irrelevant when the market moves. I had several others that I was testing that would have delivered similar or better returns, $ps $Twlo $roku $payc $ttd.
2439 2018-08-27 01:34:15 I’ve been seeing these stories on ARYC for a while now and over the last few weeks am down a ton of money! I don’t understand why the stock price isn’t going up! Can someone explain to me why? I am somewhat new to the penny stocks!
Thanks
2440 2018-08-27 01:31:31 Is it “insider trading” when a psychic buys stocks?
2441 2018-08-27 01:30:56 Which is great for the 16% of Americans who have privately held stocks. What about the rest of us?
How much will we have to pay for in the end for the #TaxScam that allowed corps to spend more than $400B on buybacks? No trickle-down there.
2442 2018-08-27 01:30:44 I’ve been seeing these stories on ARYC for a while now and over the last few weeks am down a ton of money! I don’t understand why the stock price isn’t going up! Can someone explain to me why? I am somewhat new to the penny stocks!

2444 2018-08-27 01:28:24 Public info.  We had a ban on short selling in bank stocks after the meldown if you can believe that.  Not sure how old you are
2445 2018-08-27 01:27:56 Hindsight is 20/20. It is next to impossible to determine in the heat of moment if a good company is worth holding onto despite immediate deteriating fundamentals which may or may not  improve at all. I sold some good stocks too early too but kept $GILD.
2446 2018-08-27 01:27:51 Ah, I hope my dollar tree stocks those. Then I will break down and buy some, they'd be great for my Halloween tree. (It's like a Christmas tree, but for Halloween. No judging me.)
2447 2018-08-27 01:24:56 Stocks are unproductive and speculative.
2448 2018-08-27 01:24:24 Bump stocks have been regulated...you need to brush up on your "facts".
2449 2018-08-27 01:23:37 There is currently no good way to invest directly in #lithium.  Lithium-related stocks carry all kinds of overhead and complicating factors.  Plenty of money to be made though in investing, arbitrage, shorting and other strategies.  Stay tuned.
2450 2018-08-27 01:23:10 And I don't agree with bump stocks. It's not something that is protected by the second amendment and is a get around for laws. Though banning bump stocks won't change anything as you can literally use a belt loop to do the same thing.
2451 2018-08-27 01:21:23 No. Since the mid 90's the stock market is increased primarily by the circulation of commodities and not their creation. The creation of use-values can increase stocks but again this doesn't equal a healthy economy because of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall.

2462 2018-08-27 01:04:47 How about a nationwide ban on item that can convert semi-automatic to automatic? I don’t have guns I’ve fired a gun so I don’t know the exact term. I know of bump stocks. How about mandating that every state perform a nationwide background check? Those are two. Do you know of any
2463 2018-08-27 01:04:23 #Stockmarket Futures #SPX at 2882. This is a launch number to me. I will just take what’s left of hedge down to 15% and double up on QQQ and VTI along with Resource stocks. This will be driven by weaker dollar to me. Hope it holds for run. See Monday
2464 2018-08-27 01:04:00 I talked to someone this week who said

2472 2018-08-27 00:54:06 Tax cuts only count if you make 75k + and I don't, stock market counts only if you have stocks and I don't, government not getting money from the top 10% because of the tax cuts on them so deficit going through the roof and the tariffs are costing people jobs and farmers money.
2473 2018-08-27 00:53:55 Gardening and stocks have much in common.  Think about it.
2474 2018-08-27 00:53:45 Stocks change drastically in hours and Obama lovers want credit now?
2475 2018-08-27 00:52:08 If the stock market was the only measure of our economy that would be awesome but since this is only the result of companies buying back their own stocks it’s evidence of future disaster and impending doom, you’ve aided in another Great Depression
2476 2018-08-27 00:50:21 It's a peak performance book. Yes, the mindset techniques I used and use today; can be applied to anything from trading to sports to business.
2477 2018-08-27 00:49:25 I'm assuming you're referring to bump stocks. Which don't make it a fully automatic weapon. The amount of ammo dispensed is decently less than an automatic weapon, and a fast trigger finger could output just as many. But, I am on your side about them.
2478 2018-08-27 00:49:04 When he finally goes down, I want him in stocks on the White House lawn so we can all like up and slap him at least once per person

2482 2018-08-27 00:43:08 Very few bonuses were given.  Instead, most companies bought back their stock or sat on the cash. Not a huge amount of investment.  Companies did not move back to US.  Just wait for trade tariffs to really kick in. Some companies already laying ppl off. 2018 Stocks  not 
2483 2018-08-27 00:40:14 Just not sure what else can really be done with gun control. Automatic weapons are illegal, so are bump stocks. Magazine sizes are getting smaller and smaller. Maybe raise the age of legally buying long rifles? Idk
2484 2018-08-27 00:39:49 But stocks in Apple, and bitches be crazy
2485 2018-08-27 00:39:34 That could be a stocks investment in a real airline or could be put into flight school. Wyd
2486 2018-08-27 00:39:25 Stocks were up 182% during Obama's tenure.  We will see how Trump fares in the future.
2487 2018-08-27 00:39:25 No Pain! Reality! If Trump had made NO CHANGES since Anti American Obama left, then you might have an argument. But, Trump is ERASING Obamas decisions ( Legacy) & that's when the economy, unemploy, stocks, trade started BOOMING!  He even gave you a TAX BREAK. Did Obumer?
2488 2018-08-27 00:39:10 And all Republicans voted for the rich to get richer and for the corporate world to buy back their stocks and have greater profits..
2489 2018-08-27 00:38:40 Sure the 75 straight months of job growth, the stocks going from 6500-19k sure was a joke huh
2490 2018-08-27 00:37:58 Great  job Jim - boo yah. Jim I’m worried about my @Tesla stocks, I’m not a millionaire but have a few. What do you think about the future of it. Have a great day. Enjoy 
2491 2018-08-27 00:36:43 Uh, no again (so tired, every statement at least 1 lie). Pres. Obama laid  groundwork, economy was improving w/out tax breaks 4 wealthiest. Stocks R in great shape now, though Americans will not be once the deficit reality takes hold. Americans Not receiving pay benefits now.
2492 2018-08-27 00:36:04 These stores are closing because they want to restructure, not doing enough business, been in planning for years, stores don't just wake up one morning and decide to shutdown. My health care sucks since Obama care, stocks/401k are doing great and I am not a billionaire,

2515 2018-08-27 00:14:28 Good for you, as long as you are okay in the years they are down 30%. It will happen. Dividend stocks are not diversification.
2516 2018-08-27 00:13:52 You are a hypocrite. Your lord Obama was president during many shootings passed zero legislation, except legalizing bump stocks. He even had a democrat super majority. Get a better grip on reality.

2525 2018-08-27 00:07:28 Asia stocks begin the week mostly positive after last Friday's record closes in the US, while Fed Chair Powell's gradual reiteration and hopes of a looming NAFTA breakthrough between US and Mexico adds to the optimism; ASX 200 (-0.1%), Nikkei 225 (+0.5%), KOSPI (+0.3%)
2526 2018-08-27 00:06:48 Trump knows that the growth built by Obama and spurred on by his tax cut to those people buying back their own stocks cannot sustain itself.  He will be building up a list of reasons why the market will crash and this is as good as any.
2527 2018-08-27 00:06:38 and all he’s done is remove all restraint from the stock market which despite only 5% of americans owning 95% of all stocks has somehow become an indicator of economic performance

meanwhile real wages haven’t increased since 2008
