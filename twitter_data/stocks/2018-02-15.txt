0 2018-02-15 23:59:56 No I don’t and I never said I did. I am saying that there needs to be a ban on AR. There needs to be universal background checks. There needs to be a ban on bump stocks. The mentally ill should not be able to buy guns. The madness needs to stop.
1 2018-02-15 23:59:35 I’m on my phone really trying to figure out these stocks 
2 2018-02-15 23:58:36 There is no reason a civilian should need an AR type weapon!! It is time that the @GOP and you @realDonaldTrump got off of the @NRA tit and took care of the innocents that are losing their lives to protect hi-cap clips, AR weapons and bump stocks.
3 2018-02-15 23:58:35 I pledge allegiance to the guns & the NRA of America. One nation, under siege, with assault rifles & bump stocks for all.
4 2018-02-15 23:58:35 Background checks, no assault weapons no bump stocks. People accused of domestic violence, no guns. There is a lot we can do to mitigate
5 2018-02-15 23:58:26 1/2 Don't regurgitate the line. Mental health alone is a cop out. Background checks, no guns for terrorists, no guns for mentally I'll, outlaw bump stocks, unlimited clips, track massive ammo purchases ... Any and all will statistically lead to fewer deaths. But who cares about..
6 2018-02-15 23:57:51 Divest from guns &, if you are able, boycott stores that sell guns (Walmart, Dicks Sporting Goods, etc.) Attacking the NRA, while valid, has proven ineffective. The NRA has been turned into a corp scapegoat on purpose. So #divest from #gun stocks & #boycott stores. #peoplepower
7 2018-02-15 23:57:42 Let’s be honest @SpeakerRyan, you morons wouldn’t even ban bump stocks, which serve no fucking purpose but to fire more rounds faster, so would we expect you to even think about being reasonable about gun control... no. Fuck off.
8 2018-02-15 23:57:12 Same thing for reforms on trigger and fire rate modifications (I.e. bump stocks)
9 2018-02-15 23:56:56 I dabble in stocks and bonds
10 2018-02-15 23:56:46 People who buy gun stocks following school shootings should be ashamed
11 2018-02-15 23:56:45 So I suppose you think banning bump stocks, banning AR15s, and improving background checks is attacking their rights. You have such a twisted view of things. You and the NRA gave blood on your hands. Never again will I vote Republican
12 2018-02-15 23:56:28 A lot of academic papers have come out in the 2000s support the way I invest, that there is no significant statistical difference in growth between a portfolio that has 8 stocks and that which has 100.
13 2018-02-15 23:55:55 Say what you will about the Regan admin, but at least they were smart enough to ban assault weapons while they were cutting mental health services, trumps government won't even ban bump stocks #tytlive
14 2018-02-15 23:55:37 Great statement Mr. Speaker. This is the kind of thing we need from our Government Leaders that will stop the next shooting. Good job. 
Are you eager to do anything about gun violence?
Bump Stocks or AR-15?
Or just say how sad you are for the families?
15 2018-02-15 23:55:19 @marcorubio,
We shouldn’t jump to conclusions that you or your fellow @GOP NRA stooges will lift a finger to at least TRY to reduce access to assault riffles and rapid fire bump stocks. 

Why, because you all get so much $$$ from the Russian backed @NRA!

NRA = #NotRealAmericans
16 2018-02-15 23:55:06 @marcorubio So we shouldn't even try....? WTF is wrong w/ the @GOP?!?! Ignoring the problem is MAKING IT WORSE.

40 2018-02-15 23:53:00 Then I ask again, what use is an assault rifle outside of a war? It’s not for hunting, for sport, for self-defense, or for a hobby. Why can’t we ban assault rifles if we banned rpgs, tanks, and grenades? Even if they aren’t automatic, bump stocks are still widely available.
41 2018-02-15 23:53:00 温泉行きたい温泉
42 2018-02-15 23:52:53 Did gun sales go up again today, you sick, gun defending NRA fuckers? Did you stockpile more AR-15s and bump stocks, creeps?
43 2018-02-15 23:52:49 And the NRA deserves blame, let us not be mistaken about that. The NRA has bought and paid for political protection and the NRA single handedly has prevented reasonable gun control progress like banning bump stocks
44 2018-02-15 23:52:26 Fun fact, every time there is a mass shooting gun stocks rise
45 2018-02-15 23:52:22 Let me help you identify the gaps: gun shows, private sale of guns, high powered weapons that have no use for hunting or personal defense, bump stocks, lack of training requirements for gun ownership ... am I helping yet?
46 2018-02-15 23:51:55 San Bernardino had a female shooter. It isn’t that it’s a mental illness thing, access to guns increase acts of violence and AR-15s, 30 round clips, and bump stocks turn these acts into massacres.

49 2018-02-15 23:50:40 @GOP @GOPChairwoman The GOP has blood on its hands! Never again will I vote for any Republican until you do something about gun control, the AR15, and bump stocks. All you care about is NRA money
50 2018-02-15 23:50:29 There's a reason bump stocks haven't been banned after 52 dead in Vegas, that a 18 yo can buy an AR-15 in FL and that lawmakers don't push stricter background checks...
51 2018-02-15 23:50:24 Every time a mass shooting happens gun stocks rise. People are scared and think they’ll need safety or they think guns will be taken away from them. The National rifle association donated over $800,000 to lawmakers in Florida. Members of Congress also received money from the NRA.
52 2018-02-15 23:50:09 Or maybe meet in the middle with common sense regulations. Say background checks, no guns for mentally unstable, no guns for terrorist watch list, no bum stocks and no armor piercing bullets (blue lives matter hypocrites)
53 2018-02-15 23:49:28 Achava que stocks era bem mais.
54 2018-02-15 23:49:21 Men were born with a “gun” between their legs. Have them join the military if they want military grade weapon use. It is not meant for the public. The same same goes for bump stocks.
55 2018-02-15 23:49:06 Also why the fuck haven’t bump stocks been banned yet? How those were ever legal is beyond me
56 2018-02-15 23:48:58 Stocks go up!  Economy is Great!  Children are murdered. Who cares?  Sad sad times America.
57 2018-02-15 23:48:47 Or benefit from tax break and money made from stocks since he became president?
58 2018-02-15 23:48:34 Marijuana stocks are the wave, theyre not gonna have fast growth atm but will soon. We had a small taste of what is capable of happening until trump and his goons decided to have another war on drugs and repealed a law obama put in.
59 2018-02-15 23:48:19 We’re offering a BOGO on bump stocks and armor piercing rounds today!
60 2018-02-15 23:47:55 Not military assault weapon.  Just FYI.  Republicans were willing to ban bump stocks (sp?) Dems wouldn't settle for that alone.
61 2018-02-15 23:47:55 Most beat-up stocks of my portfolio (down -25% year high) : $ACO.X ATCO $ENB (Enbridge) and $KHC (Kraft-Heinz Company). What's yours ?
62 2018-02-15 23:47:35 I would vote for a candidate that says they want to ban bump stocks, but obviously that would not be the only factor I considered. Bump stocks are pretty irrelevant in my mind. Anyway, I'm sorry for engaging in a discussion on a topic you insterted yourself into on a public forum

72 2018-02-15 23:45:39 1) The reason why you can literally be crazy and still buy an AR-15 with all the ammunition and bump stocks and large magazines you want is because of the @GOP.

2) Governments don't have any money to fix anything or buy anything or provide basic services because of the @GOP.
73 2018-02-15 23:45:25 I hunt. I shoot. I see no reason for bump stocks, silencers or military grade weapons in society. I'm for common sense gun safety. Raffling off a AR-15 is irresponsible.
74 2018-02-15 23:45:19 Ideas - Let's have a senator start a bill forbidding bump stocks.   
Let's have a senator start a bill forbidding AR 15s and any other semi-automatic weapons 
Let's have a senator start to return any NRA money that was given to his or her campaign.

77 2018-02-15 23:44:36 @realDonaldTrump give them bump stocks back ground checks give us concealed carry reciprocity
78 2018-02-15 23:44:28 Only in America can a 20-year-old not be able to buy a beer, but can buy any number of weapons, bump-stocks and 30 round magazines.
79 2018-02-15 23:43:47 Yah the initial rush a month or so ago was insanity. Mostly because so many noobs entered the market.  When I was a noob in stocks I paper traded for a good 6 months to understand basics.
80 2018-02-15 23:43:33 Yes. But please understand the following thesis. HY rates has decreased in comparison with 2005-2007 (HY is closest asset class to stocks) by approximately 2%. These 2% cost 5 additional points for P/E ratio. 5!!! Where they are expensive?

82 2018-02-15 23:43:01 This is exactly my point. Kids don't need guns. Adults with violent history or history of mental illness shouldn't be able to get guns. If you aren't hunting, you don't need a rifle or a suppressor. Bump stocks should be illegal. Just my opinion.
83 2018-02-15 23:42:52 That would actually be a false statement had the last two proposed @NRA recommendations been passed by Congress bump stocks would be banned and the shooting yesterday probably doesn’t happen because the HIPA laws would have allowed the police and school more options on this kid.
84 2018-02-15 23:42:24 If we aren't going to regulate guns... let's tax them to hell. Tax bullets, tax bump stocks, tax magazines, tax all guns. Use the money to fill in the huge holes in Trumps budget.
85 2018-02-15 23:42:18 Oh well, let's just not do anything about it then? How about bump stocks? We can't even get those stopped from being legally sold, and that should be low hanging fruit
86 2018-02-15 23:41:57 They said the same about bump stocks after the Vegas shooting.
87 2018-02-15 23:41:55 Crypto should be a walk in the park for you if you come from stocks isn't it? Haha
88 2018-02-15 23:41:49 Except for the critical fact of having select fire capability which is what defines an actual assault rifle. But again you are using the political definition of pistol grips, or stocks or whatever other cosmetic feature they want to ad. Functionally the AR-15 is no different
89 2018-02-15 23:41:48 Are you, though? You didn’t even ban bump stocks.
90 2018-02-15 23:41:40 As for gun ownership, (which I am not against), the weaponry used at that time couldn't fire off a rapid succession of ammunition. Bump stocks, high capacity magazines and other mass shooting capable additions weren't even conceived.
91 2018-02-15 23:41:22 No, they are not. Not as long as "extensions" like bump stocks and extended magazines are allowed.
92 2018-02-15 23:41:04 Assault rifles, large magazines, bump stocks and probably a host of other killing tools. Background checks, gun show loopholes and licensing need to be addressed. If not, we'll work toward banning guns altogether.

97 2018-02-15 23:40:03 #investing in alternatives to the usual stocks-and-bond brings potential for substantial gain and substantial loss, which you have to acknowledge before you can invest in them. #securitieslaw comes into play in understanding these investment options. @RyanSwansonLaw
98 2018-02-15 23:39:24 Yep, I've done really well trading XRPUSD and I'm glad I sold at near highs and daytrade a sizeable block. In summary when you've traded a lot in stocks and Forex, risk management is #1 priority.
99 2018-02-15 23:38:48 Seat belts don’t prevent ALL traffic fatalities, but since their use became law, there has been a huge drop in deaths. No one solution exists, but universal background checks, preventing the mentally ill from buying and banning semi-automatic and bump stocks WOULD SAVE LIVES!
100 2018-02-15 23:38:48 Majority of people recognize that gun removal is never going to happen. They just want stricter policies on bump stocks and other attachments
101 2018-02-15 23:38:38 Why is that uneducated? Bump Stocks make it easier to fire a gun and reload with speed. You seem an honest and reasonable man, why is that a bad thing to say?
102 2018-02-15 23:38:16 Opened swing trades with $ON and $BRKS today.  Both stocks approaching Bollinger midline.  Will sell both tomorrow before the long weekend. #swingtrader #SwingTrading
103 2018-02-15 23:37:25 Presuming my position? wow. And no, that's not all anyone wants. What about the bump stocks and making everyone who has one a criminal?
104 2018-02-15 23:37:21 More gun regulations and higher level of security at all schools should be the answer. Changing our 2nd amendment will take too much time..
105 2018-02-15 23:36:53 Cliff's Notes ('specially for @BillOReilly):

Fewer guns.
No civilian assault rifles.
No bump stocks.
Congressional refusal of NRA donations.

Easiest fucking "A" on a test ever.
106 2018-02-15 23:36:38 Yes, a lunatic with access to a weapon of mass destruction. We don’t need AR-15 style weapons, bump stocks, or high capacity magazines.
107 2018-02-15 23:36:37 Looks like July for Trudeau ‘s announcement of marijuana. I will be buying top Canadian stocks on pullback . IMO now is time to begin averaging in
108 2018-02-15 23:36:30 And no civilian needs to have access to an AR-15 or bump stocks either. Stop coddling the NRA and protect our country and it’s children from mass shootings.
109 2018-02-15 23:36:23 The NRA heavily lobbies for assault weapons. It funnels millions to buy votes. It’s videos are disturbing. This isn’t the old NRA this is one that is aggressive and promotes bump stocks and all guns. Common sense is not a trait of the new NRA
110 2018-02-15 23:36:20 Nobody is saying take ALL the guns away. They’re saying let’s get rational and reasonable gun control in place. They’re asking for reasonable things like “no assault rifles” and “no bump stocks” and “better background checks”. Rational stuff.
111 2018-02-15 23:36:11 You think $TTPH close to bottom after today ? I'm still in starter position at 2.16 looking for 2.40-2.50 or add big at 1.80-1.90's
112 2018-02-15 23:35:52 The GOP can’t even pass the most basic gun laws! Gun stocks???? Shameful!
113 2018-02-15 23:35:28 “You are never alone” is accurate because some AR15 maniac could be watching any of us at any time with a high powered scope. There wasn’t even anything done about bump stocks after the Vegas massacre.  WTF is going on with our own govt allowing us to go to slaughter? SHAME!
114 2018-02-15 23:35:22 Don’t let your past hold you back. Keep moving. It’s one thing to think about It but your the one who controls how It dictates your future!
115 2018-02-15 23:35:17 Possible, but hardly a new development.  Also doesn't explain Brent holding, as stocks dropped are stocks dropped, not just a WTI issue.
116 2018-02-15 23:34:53 Not sure wtf that has to do with "gas leaks" at the bolt from NATO rounds. Besides, pretty sure Colt was making the both the AR15 & M16 back in the day. Rumor in my unit with first plastic stocks was the 16 made by Mattel.
117 2018-02-15 23:34:49 Or maybe this:
—Supporting a state-wide or national bill to ban bump stocks (like those used in the Las Vegas massacre), similar to the bill passed in Massachusetts 
—Supporting a ban on assault weapons, similar to SB-880 in California
118 2018-02-15 23:34:47 They are GONE in November!  They pass pro gun legislation H.B.38, so they can go anywhere with their concealed weapons!  The Bill is on its way to the Senate!  Nothing on bump stocks or AR-15!!
119 2018-02-15 23:34:40 They shouldn't have to go to churches and schools for protection if you just banned AR15's an, bump stocks and large magazines. #RenewAssaultWeaponBan
120 2018-02-15 23:34:29 @RepTomRice So tired of brave teachers having 2 lay down their lives 2 save kids bc COWARDS n Congress too afraid of losing their jobs 2 stand up 2 NRA & pass common sense gun laws (ban AR-15s/high cap/mags/bump stocks & have. univers.backgrd. cks) that could save so many lives.
121 2018-02-15 23:34:07 Woot, this is called having dialogue and frankly there should be more of it in this country. While I believe in our 2A rights I also believe it is unnecessary for ordinary citizens to have AR-15s. I also don’t see the need for bump stocks.
122 2018-02-15 23:33:57 すっごい寝てめっちゃ頭スッキリしたけど頭から全部すっ飛んだしもう無理かも
123 2018-02-15 23:33:44 It’s not enough. You can convert a semi to a fully automatic with a rubber band, there’s tutorials for how to do it on YouTube. You can’t just ban bump stocks and expect that to take care of the problem. Most shooters didn’t even have to use them. Semi is fast enough.
124 2018-02-15 23:33:42 Repubs.won't even outlaw bump stocks or people on terror watch list. Many r just sick&tired of hypocricy&insincerity
125 2018-02-15 23:33:10 @Patstock Keep in mind the last market crash everything went down. I focus mainly on regular Stocks, Gold & Oil (long/short) $SPY $GLD $USO
126 2018-02-15 23:33:01 2/15/18........fox news = FAKE NEWS, you know nothing of stocks, you report what’s good but do not report it’s fall, you’re making it appear like it NEVER FELL.........SORRY piddly organization for a news outlet.........
127 2018-02-15 23:32:28 I already said that nothing is a perfect shield. Back alley sales and stolen weapons are part of that uncontrollable random acts I mentioned. Vegas could have been stopped by the idea of controlled numbers, no sales of high powered military rifles/stocks, and shared information.
128 2018-02-15 23:31:33 false! the rate of fire can be bumped up to 200 rounds per minute with mods like bump stocks. even then, if you need 45 rounds to defend your family, you are probably so bad of a shot, you probably shouldnt own a gun.
129 2018-02-15 23:31:16 Little known benefit to freaking out when the market drops:

If you freak out and sell your stocks, you’ll almost certainly have smaller account at retirement. But the anxiety caused by freaking out probably also reduced your life span some. Less days to live = less money needed.
130 2018-02-15 23:31:04 The greatest investor of our generation has been no better this century than simply holding a market-wide portfolio of value stocks?

Berkshire Hathaway = +10.2%

132 2018-02-15 23:30:40 Same merging CO as NNSR before the debacle. Following cautiously, but huge merging company if this plays out
133 2018-02-15 23:30:34 Because the bill brought forward was far to broad and would have eliminated much more than bump stocks. Also in my opinion banning them is a bit ridiculous because the same effect can be achieved with a belt loop or a rubber band.
134 2018-02-15 23:30:26 Stocks are going up. 
After last week’s stock market chaos sent the major U.S. averages down 4% 
On Thursday, each of the major averages added over 1% with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading the way, rising 1.6%, while the Dow added 1.2%, and the S&P 500 gained 1.2%. #YahooFinance
135 2018-02-15 23:30:16 I'm a hunter. Love guns. Don't own semi auto anything or bump stocks. Eat what I shoot. We need BETTER gun cntrl
136 2018-02-15 23:29:23 @TomiLahren : Ok... so let’s talk about Vegas. If Automatic assault rifles are banned in the US, does it not make sense to bad bump stocks? Bring it!
137 2018-02-15 23:29:18 Have you had enough time to consider how complicit you are in mass murder? Newtown. Las Vegas.  Parkland.  To name a few.  Stop being the NRA’s bitch and enact gun control now - esp. outlawing AR15 and bump stocks.  #republicanfail
138 2018-02-15 23:29:12 And people who trade stocks trade bitcoin too so it’s not a scam
139 2018-02-15 23:28:33 Thoughts and prayers haven’t worked. How about doing something? Ban bump stocks, ban AR-15 and automatic weapons. Background checks. 
#GunReformNow
140 2018-02-15 23:28:17 Yes, but people can still defend their family with a handgun. Defending yourself with a big gun that can spew up to 800 bullets/min and shoot through walls is overkill. Start with bump stocks and assault rifles, because those battles are easier to win.
141 2018-02-15 23:27:31 Yes but the arms the fathers were talking about were not semi automatic or automatic. The guns envisioned were to protect their families and selves in often hostile territory and to keep a well -appointed militia. Does not include bump stocks or AK-15

U do know other countries have the internet too right?
They don't have mass killings in schools, concerts, and bars and every other place like USA does. 
It the assault rifles, the 30 round magazines, the bump stocks, high capacity rounds.
144 2018-02-15 23:27:05 my grandma still carries a pick of my daddy in her wallet. i know he’s smiling down on us 
145 2018-02-15 23:26:23 If no one has the guts to ban assault style weapons, how about we:

- impose a 50 cent tax on each and every bullet sold. Use money to help improve school safety
- ban large magazines so they reload more often.
- ban bump stocks so hundreds can't get mowed down like in Vegas.
146 2018-02-15 23:26:15 Sir I am in trouble I have send some stocks to UP on ewaybill my vehicle is stopped by department they are saying I need UP road permit also they asking me to pay 2 lac as penelty and there are 100 of trucks are stopped at UP checkpoints kindly help
147 2018-02-15 23:25:59 No, you grow up.

1. Let the CDC study the epidemic and propose solutions
2. Regulate / ration ammunition
3. Reinstate the ban on assault rifles
4. Ban high-capacity magazines
5. Ban bump-stocks
6. Make it difficult as poss. to get a gun
7. Recognize your gun fetish is a disease

156 2018-02-15 23:22:46 I understand. Bump stocks are not illegal (some states they are), and isn’t considered a firearm alteration, according to the ATF (I think).

However the goal is to fire multiple rounds at a higher rate— is that really necessary?
157 2018-02-15 23:22:45 Of course I have stocks! I've invested into many farm produce companies! Gotta finance them apples 
158 2018-02-15 23:22:40 Crypto or stocks or other?
159 2018-02-15 23:22:30 Don’t ban guns. Ban bump-fire stocks.  No reason for them!
160 2018-02-15 23:22:04 Of course. Wood stocks makes a 30-30 less lethal than an ar15.
161 2018-02-15 23:21:50 Liquidated everything the second day of the crash (stocks I’ve been accumulating for past year)except my collection of $SPY ETF that I religiously add to every month. Still weary of the market. We’re raising interest rates and the market only fell to levels seen in Dec. 2017
162 2018-02-15 23:21:40 I love to hunt & believe in gun rights. HOWEVER, I have ZERO need for large capacity magazines, armour piercing bullets, automatic kits, bump stocks, assault-like weapons, etc. for hunting, recreational sport, or self defense. There ARE gun common sense & those things AREN'T it!

167 2018-02-15 23:20:54 Not a damn word about banning assault weapons.  Let's pray,I agree then immediately start banning assault weapons and bump stocks. bullshit,Ryan is Nothing But bullshit
168 2018-02-15 23:20:29 Stock brokers/registered investment advisors were trained by #coldcalling which I believes proves just how skilled we are as #salesmen but not necessarily great at picking #stocks
169 2018-02-15 23:20:27 The argument that a restriction on gun ownership won’t work in every single instance is a red herring. People still speed despite speeding laws but on the whole the laws make the roads safer. Bump stocks weren’t a factor here but certainly were in Vegas

172 2018-02-15 23:20:12 Bump stocks are toys that use recoil to emulate automatic fire. However, this makes semi-automatics overheat and/or jam easily since they aren't built to sustain that ROF. Also makes accuracy impossible.
173 2018-02-15 23:19:43 They haven’t even outlawed bump stocks!   This was a slam dunk after Las Vegas
174 2018-02-15 23:18:25 Well, I’m a centrist who voted Trump, and I will tell you straight that this kid NEVER should have been able to buy this weapon. Sales of these need to be severely restricted. Ditto high cap mags, high penetration rounds and bump stocks. The Brady bill caused NO inconvenience.
175 2018-02-15 23:18:25 Great day for gun stocks!

177 2018-02-15 23:18:06 Well you can do anything you want but what you give up with individual stocks is the diversification. The 4 categories he recommends give you a wide variety of the market so maybe you pick a few stocks you like and add them in along with the 4 funds he recommends
178 2018-02-15 23:17:56 Okay.

-But magazines. 
And usually in multiples. 

-And ammo buys are not limited. 
-And reloading those weapons is ultimately far faster, killing more innocent people.
-And bump stocks.
179 2018-02-15 23:17:13 I'm adding more in the morning
180 2018-02-15 23:16:35 Pumped that CSE stocks are now on @stockchartscom  Just add .ca at end of ticker 
181 2018-02-15 23:16:28 Sure. I can name several. (1) Reinstating the ban on AR-15s, which has been the weapon of choice for shooters in mass killings; (2) banning bump stocks, which increase the death toll in massacres; (3) prohibiting suspected terrorists on the No Fly List from buying guns...
182 2018-02-15 23:16:16 Imagine if rappers had stocks you could invest in 
183 2018-02-15 23:15:55 Bump stocks are extremely rarely used, and I personally think paddock would have killed more if he didn't use it. Full auto reduces accuracy, but the only non semi auto hand guns are muzzle loaders generally.
184 2018-02-15 23:15:44 Considering they can’t even support banning bump stocks, my guess is I’ll wait a while.
185 2018-02-15 23:15:16 Ok guns.
Why are private sales without a background check legal?
Why is there no greater requirement or licence required to buy an assault weapon?
Why are bump stocks and full-auto kits legal?
Why are right leaning americans so against restricting these things?

194 2018-02-15 23:13:51 Just like Republicans who said they were open to looking at the issue of bumper stocks right after the Vegas shooting but did nothing. #GunReformNow
195 2018-02-15 23:13:26 As the aftermaths of past mass shootings have shown, “sounds open to” is not at all the same as “will take action.” (E.g. open to closing background check loopholes after Sandy Hook; open to banning bump stocks after Las Vegas.)
196 2018-02-15 23:12:54 IMHO this is only the beginning BLOK eft has some interesting names in there. Its also interesting as its a new way to manipulate the stocks in the EFT
197 2018-02-15 23:12:29 Yep. But ownership is not sole issue. How many Nordic owners have access to semi auto rifles, bump stocks and unlimited ammo? What are legal regs on training, insurance etc?
198 2018-02-15 23:12:25 In off shore accounts where it isn't spent, tied up in accounts that do nothing. The rich are leeches on the economy. Stocks, investments, etc: mostly just ways the rich siphon more money off. The poor run the economy. When they have no money the economy stagnates.
199 2018-02-15 23:12:20 had to file taxes later than usual cause i sold lots of stocks this year
200 2018-02-15 23:12:14 Dunt want to show disrespect and thoughts too all who have suffered,but,’the right to bear arms’ when it was a musket is a totes different thing to an ‘assault type weapon’ wiv ‘after market’ magazines n rapid fire stocks 
201 2018-02-15 23:12:10 Flags are at half-staff again after the latest mass shooting. I say leave them there until background checks are required for ALL gun sales, assault weapons and bump stocks are outlawed, people with mental illness and on TSA terrorist list are prohibited from buying guns.
202 2018-02-15 23:11:14 dont know much about guns lol but my point stands with people using bump stocks to make those weapons full auto
203 2018-02-15 23:10:51 I’d agree with you Rizz. But the issue is political. You really see Ryan or McConnell putting any legislation on the floor? Not even for bump stocks after Vegas!
204 2018-02-15 23:10:45 Iceland stocks some really healthy food, no different than Marks & Spencer's regarding choice #bbcqt
205 2018-02-15 23:10:44 and you think it could do the same amount of damage? he's not the only person in the world that can get a hold of bump fire stocks
206 2018-02-15 23:10:42 I think there are certain conditions which make gun ownership problematic. Paranoid schizophrenia and domestic violence for instance. More importantly, comprehensive background checks on ALL sales of guns and banning of purely offensive equipment like bump stocks makes sense.
207 2018-02-15 23:10:37 That being said, there's things that can be done. I'd be all for raising the age limit to 21 to buy. Eliminate bump stocks which the NRA said they'd be fore. And stop publicizing the shooter, eliminate the potential Fame aspect of it.
208 2018-02-15 23:10:21 Automatic weapons are already illegal in the US. The AR15 (not an assault rifle btw), is semi-automatic. Yes, there are things such as bump stocks, but I do believe the NRA is actually in favor of banning them.
209 2018-02-15 23:10:18 so ban bump stocks, ban ar15s, ban 10 shot magazines - the next one will just use the next most effective kit and you'll always be one room of dead kids behind the curve
210 2018-02-15 23:09:58 maybe in practice but how is that enforced, if you can buy bump stocks so easily and legally. No ones gonna register
211 2018-02-15 23:09:05 What’s the Bushmaster rated per minute? Why did Colonials prefer muskets to rifles in the 1780s? Why do hunters consider the AR-15 a gun for losers? What do bump stocks do?

217 2018-02-15 23:08:18 And bump stocks? Kevlar piercing bullets? Domestic abusers and folks on no fly lists are ok to buy guns? Gun show purchasers with no background checks? Kids getting killed by accident? If gun control can only save a few lives it's not worth it? Sad
218 2018-02-15 23:08:16 I'm not defending Reid. I'm defending Harris (who has been in the Senate since January of 2017). 

Personally I would like to see all guns outlawed entirely, but we can't even get bump stocks banned.

239 2018-02-15 23:01:53 You've asked that question already. I'm starting to think you don't understand it. They had no idea these types of guns and modifications would exist. When saying the right to bear arms shall not be infringed, they were talking about muskets. Not AR's with bump stocks
240 2018-02-15 23:01:51 Seat belts don’t prevent ALL traffic fatalities, but since their use became law, there has been a huge drop in deaths. No one solution exists, but universal background checks, preventing the mentally ill from buying and banning semi-automatic and bump stocks WOULD SAVE LIVES!
241 2018-02-15 23:01:51 2/2 The legislation they are trying to push now, right now, would make it easier to get a gun and carry it over state lines. They quietly backed away from the bum stocks too. So yeah, I think republicans should answer that question about it being bearable.
242 2018-02-15 23:01:34 LET US BE CLEAR @NicolleDWallace @CommissBratton and anyone else- THIS is NOT A SENATE problem. it is a REPUBLICAN PROBLEM. 
Ask THEM why hey REFUSE to do ANYTHING ABOUT GUNS. 
they had a chance to #DoSomething about bump stocks and DID NOTHING.  #GunReformNow
243 2018-02-15 23:01:32 I was meaning banning bump stocks after Vegas. I blurred references there. Sorry about that. My knowledge of guns is limited, thank u for being so patient. Perhaps making automatic or partially automatic handguns etc harder to get would help. I guess I do mean semi-auto rifle ban
244 2018-02-15 23:01:05 with "bump stocks" easily and cheaply added to make them automatic as in Las Vegas last year.
245 2018-02-15 23:00:55 Can’t buy a beer but can buy an AR-15?? What about bump stocks?? NRA OWNS Republicans. MONEY wins over lives...every time. Hope you go to Florida, look those grieving parents in the eye & explain why it’s happened AGAIN. Why Republicans don’t care how many times. #GOPwontBuckNRA
246 2018-02-15 23:00:51 The @NRA got the NICS background system passed in the first place when @TheDemocrats wanted waiting periods. If you think bump stocks are the problem you don't even know what the problem is, let alone how to fix it. Assault is already illegal.
247 2018-02-15 23:00:41 -background checks for ALL purchases 
-ban bump stocks
-raise purchase age to 21 for rifles, like handguns
-we can discuss high capacity magazines, not sure about where the limit should be set
248 2018-02-15 23:00:38 No no! Y'all need teachers armed with silenced 9mms and access to assault weapons with bump-stocks. Then everyone will be safer...
249 2018-02-15 23:00:18 I already knew that I learned that from the Las Vegas shootings. But the gun itself is used for military there is no need to have it and the bump stocks were supposed to be big and they were gonna start that legislation but it got nowhere I know that too. I pay attention
250 2018-02-15 22:59:57 Canaccord Genuity downgrades $IPH to Hold, cuts target to $4.40. Explanation: "A mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma". Lawyers and share markets don't mix? #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities
251 2018-02-15 22:59:32 i personally think the age of purchase for any weapon, knives included, should be 21. i think anyone flagged for violent offense of any real severity, should be on a no purchase list. kill off the gun show loophole. bump stocks or other mods like it should be illegal.
252 2018-02-15 22:58:31 Market Close: MBS +9bps; DOW +306.88; NASDAQ +112.82; S&P 500 +32.57; 10yr Treasury 2.91%; Stocks continue to rebound, even with higher inflation data in Wholesale side, and MBS improves off yesterday's low.  Yields remain unchanged from yesterday's close.
253 2018-02-15 22:58:13 We used to use slide fire when I was a young man. Not personally familiar with bump stocks. But, I can tell you once you’ve fired these weapons you know which ones are clearly not for hunting or self defense.
254 2018-02-15 22:58:00 An AR 15 with a bump stock fires more rounds per min than a thompson sub machine gun. If we banned thompson why not bump-stocks?"
255 2018-02-15 22:57:58 Top Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying Nowhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-stocks-warren-buffett-buying-221100885.html
256 2018-02-15 22:57:53 Congress can't even ban bump stocks. Need sensible gun control now
257 2018-02-15 22:57:51 Politicians accepting money from the gun lobby is a start too! I know how complicated it is. It won’t be easy. But we need to start. Can you believe they still haven’t passed regulations on bump stocks after Vegas? It’s unfathomable.
258 2018-02-15 22:57:49 $AKAO big diff @EarlyRetiree_SA   baker is a biotech fund running a portfolio making decisions about tradeoffs bet stocks.  They could have sold $akao for a variety of reasons.. Duggan on other hand has less than 5 equity names and continues to buy aggressivly at these levels
259 2018-02-15 22:57:36 See which stocks are posting big moves after the bell.
260 2018-02-15 22:57:14 You aren't making more money the richest people are. You might see a  couple bucks but in the big scheme of things it's NOTHING. The middle class  deserved the tax break not the richest Americans. Corps are buying back  stocks not giving significant raises
261 2018-02-15 22:57:11 Yeah, they all talked a lot of good stuff after Sandy Hook too.  Then, crickets.  Heck, even after Vegas... we will discuss bump stocks.  Then, crickets.
262 2018-02-15 22:57:10 I own guns too, and I’m with you. But I’ve debated “common sense gun control” with my pro 2nd ammendment friends. The only thing we all agreed on was banning bump stocks...and our politicians failed at that. It should have been a slam dunk!
263 2018-02-15 22:56:57 Here's an idea. Why don't we all pour out in the streets and march until they do something. Why does no one ever march for gun control. Take away the military assault rifles and guns that every tom dick and harry can purchase anywhere. Also the ammo and large clips, bump stocks.
264 2018-02-15 22:56:49 Hunting rifles can be transported with permit and license, unloaded, ammunition in a locked case. Bump stocks illegal.Firearms for shooting at a range can be transported, without ammo, with license and permit, to a range where ammo is provided, either purchased or secured on site

266 2018-02-15 22:55:39 @Saudi_Aramco A suggestion to have the stocks for the #Aramco_IPO as a #crypto_currency 
267 2018-02-15 22:55:05 For goodness sakes, I went to your twitter page in hopes of finding some reasoning since you are a victim yourself of a shooting but that was stupid on my part since you thought it was "too early" to vote on banning bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting.
268 2018-02-15 22:54:39 Currently #stocks are rising at a +14,000% compounded annual rate. #Trump will make #GDP rise +13,997% to catch up.  #MAGA #BigFatUglyBubble
269 2018-02-15 22:54:08 I’ll concede the no guns on campus being a non-factor. But we only have background checks on a portion of purchases. And we haven’t even banned bump stocks after Vegas.
270 2018-02-15 22:53:46 NOBODY should be able to own an assault rifle. NOBODY should be able to sell stocks or other gadgets to turn a gun into an automatic rapid fire assault weapon. NO MORE CHILDREN should die. My goodness. Can the Right stop receiving payoff money (ie: campaign donations)from the NRA
271 2018-02-15 22:53:38 Sure they give money to Republicans, but they supported legislation to make background checks mandatory. They supported making automatic weapons illegal which they are, and they support banning bump stocks. My question is what solution do you have besides repealing 2A?
272 2018-02-15 22:53:37 Finally getting my strategy down and taking emotions out of it and keep loses small, learning you can always go back to that investment that has failed once it has set up again. #stocks #investors #investing
273 2018-02-15 22:53:32 What, remove the massive #gun problem? Or deploy MORE guns (the #American way) ... They couldn't even ban bump stocks in #USA.
274 2018-02-15 22:53:31 Let's talk about how the gun makers stocks rises every time a mass shooting happens. Let's talk about the prescription drugs that are in the shooter systems. Let's talk about how lobbyist pay the congress to prolong the bills. Let's talk about how no one really cares about anyone

276 2018-02-15 22:53:16 Ask your buddy Trump, who caved in to NRA demands, repealing mental health  health checks for gun registry, and not stopping gun stocks being sold to civilians.
277 2018-02-15 22:52:12 YOU are deadly! Why don't you focus on protecting our kids from getting murdered in school? Why don't you ban assault weapons? Those are designed only  to kill, maim and cause mass casualties! Why in the hell are they available to the general public? Then there's bump stocks
278 2018-02-15 22:51:53 More guns are going to be bought now. Buy gun stocks. Tragedy always makes people go buy more guns.  #TheFive
279 2018-02-15 22:50:50 1/ Again I need to explain the obvious, why? It's in Canada's interest to be welcoming to foreign investment in our businesses that create employment for Canadians & pay taxes here,not to foreign investment in our Real Estate used as penny stocks(that's not in Canada's interest).
280 2018-02-15 22:50:22 How's that horse diarrhea stock going, $JAGX Pumpers? Sorry, I mean investors. Enjoy that RS you sheeple. Say hi to $RNVA for me when you two stocks meet on the OTC before bankruptcy.
281 2018-02-15 22:50:01 In other news, some guy on this train is talking someone into buying penny stocks.
282 2018-02-15 22:49:40 Yes, it's the semi auto with large capacity clips, bump stocks, etc. The weapons that were made for military use.
283 2018-02-15 22:49:38 STOP!!! GOP HAS HAD IT'S TIME. THEY VOTED AGAINST EVEN BUMP STOCKS. IN NOVEMBER THIS GOP US DONE, THEY ARE COMPLICIT IN MURDER.THINK PEOPLE. RHETORIC IS NOT STOPPING OUR CHILDREN FROM BEING KILLED.  Thttps://twitter.com/CNN/status/964256424284049408
284 2018-02-15 22:49:31 Sure, half mast, that should help. 
By the way, what ever happened regarding regulating 'bump-stocks'? Oh right, that was the last massacre.
285 2018-02-15 22:49:16 except this guy would have still had access he had no mental illness diagnosis and also the Obama admin approved bump stocks so slow ur hypocrisy down
286 2018-02-15 22:49:06 Correction: ban semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks  etc. whatever it is that are used to kill lots of people easily
287 2018-02-15 22:48:56 Damn, you know this almost reminds me of Forbes magazine, who get shills to write articles to boost stocks for their investors while they're on the verge of collapse... I mean really... Forbes? It's so obvious...
288 2018-02-15 22:48:42 @DNC @GOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @LindseyGrahamSC Linsey Graham, would vote against Bump Stocks, but not against semi-automatic rifles. He is the most namby pamby wishy washy spineless lawmaker in modern history. How much is he in hock with the NRA.
289 2018-02-15 22:48:42 It's hard to hope for change when u hear people like Sen. Graham say "I will vote to ban bump stocks but I won't vote to ban AR-15's"
290 2018-02-15 22:48:40 80-90% support comprehensive background checks and banning bump stocks, big clips, and AR-15s. We are the only industrialized county with this problem
291 2018-02-15 22:48:38 Military AR rifles are fully automatic and are already illegal to own. What IS legal are semi automatic rifles dressed up as ARs. Semi auto rifles have been around more than 80 years. The controversial bump stocks make them mimic full auto.
292 2018-02-15 22:48:37 @Baircave couldn't   of   stocks !! :( 
293 2018-02-15 22:48:29 Lock up anyone deemed abnormal. Deport aliens. Turn them all in. Continue free access to AK47s and bump stocks. I'm sure we will have fewer mass murders. Jerk.
294 2018-02-15 22:48:04 They did exactly what they should have done...nothing.
Bump stocks didn't kill anyone the psycho did.
You are never going to understand that people are the cause of these killings. 
There is one basic fact.
EVERYONE of these killings were in "gun-free zones".
295 2018-02-15 22:47:45 By seizing stocks of company.
296 2018-02-15 22:47:41 Can someone please explain why he said "a child of god is dead"??? Who is he talking about? And why singular if 17 people died? And why the hell is he talking about bump stocks? The whole speech was just really odd
297 2018-02-15 22:47:36 Honor them with a ban on assault rifles.
Honor them with no more bump stocks.
Honor them with serious backround checks and waiting periods.
Honor them with common-sense gun regulations and reform.
Honor them by making it a crime to own auto & semi auto guns.
Otherwise, shut up!
298 2018-02-15 22:47:04 ...and they all began to discuss what should be done to make sure semi-automatic and automatic weapons, bump stocks are better regulated; background checks are made much more stringent and sharing is streamlined...
Oh! And then I woke up  from that beautiful dream...
299 2018-02-15 22:47:00 We have to hand over huge amounts of our fish stocks to be allocated elsewhere, we have courts in other countries over ruling our own laws! We have to accept paedophiles grooming our kids, we have to trade with only those we're allowed to trade with! Balls to all that. #getout
300 2018-02-15 22:46:34 Oh man. I missed this one. Stocks not to invest in: ramen, boring cars, dollar stores, “amazon deal” manufacturers, cardboard tasting pizza.
301 2018-02-15 22:46:00 Maybe people need to see it to realize the gravity of the situation.. because obviously people think it’s okay for mentally unstable people to buy semi Automatic rifles and bump stocks.. it’s sad but why sugar coat it? Children are DYING..
302 2018-02-15 22:45:38 What was that one again? Weren't we going to do something about bump stocks, you know because of the largest domestic terror attack since 9/11? And then....
303 2018-02-15 22:45:21 Stocks went up every shooting & I invested every time why cause I caught on to the patterns
304 2018-02-15 22:44:30 & as if COMMON SENSE & BALANCE r not possible is NOT going to ban guns nor should it but could we ban bump stocks FFSX guns 4 mentallyIl

306 2018-02-15 22:44:04 has there been another mass shooting w bump stocks?

308 2018-02-15 22:43:59 We have gun control. You cannot purchase a firearm without a background check.  It is illegal to carry a concealed weapon.  Automatic weapons are illegal and soon bump stocks will be.
If you are a convicted felon you may not own a firearm. 
Do you think criminals adhere to this?
309 2018-02-15 22:43:56 This city girl lived  in the Belt for 2 years and saddening is to have witnessed this lifestyle. Reviving purity is a must for everyone. Just because uncle John stocks up on spirits Sat. to be able to drunk-up on Sun/after church, doesn’t fly.
310 2018-02-15 22:43:39 Sometimes I wonder if I'm making a mistake by not moving more funds from my stocks portfolio into crypto. I currently have only a few thousands invested on crypto. Decisions, decisions.  
311 2018-02-15 22:42:35 Preach. This problem does not have just one solution. Just like you can believe in the 2nd Amendment & belive that assault weapons, bump stocks & lay citizen arsenals need to be regulated. #CommonSenseGunLawsNow
312 2018-02-15 22:42:29 Who’s the idiot on @abcnews this morning saying unlike stocks, Bitcoin is ‘speculative’ and not an ‘investment’? How is buying shares on the stock market NOT speculative. Moron.
313 2018-02-15 22:42:27 You know how the gun control conversation begins to wane after a week or so? Not. Any. More. And, let’s be specific: Assault Weapons Ban, including bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Sales, purchases and possession are to be illegal.
314 2018-02-15 22:42:16 @TheFive We need a mental health database connected 2 Fed&State background check. Close loop on gun shows (Show a permit 2 buy from a cert. Vendor). I'm a 2A man but this makes sense. BTW @US Congress @SpeakerRyan when are you going to ban bump stocks which is supported by NRA?
315 2018-02-15 22:42:06 You just lost my vote with your stance on assault weapons, bump stocks, etc.

Maybe you should stop using emotions to guide you and use logic.
The last time you did that would be the first time.
322 2018-02-15 22:40:57 We need gun regulations! No one needs bump stocks, no clips more than 10 rounds, no silencers, make flea markets and gun shows vett buyers, and 3 day cooling off not instant hand guns! @NRA @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump Wake up people!!

327 2018-02-15 22:40:11 And also, "people that don't give a shit about laws...", this guy purchased his gun legally, the Vegas shooter purchased all his guns and bump stocks legally....They don't need to give a shit about laws, because there aren't any.

329 2018-02-15 22:39:09 The same can be said of the right. How many gun control supporters were accused by conservatives as wanting to take guns away from law abiding citizens? After every mass shooting under Obama, gun stocks increased because of that fear
330 2018-02-15 22:39:02 Ok You are freaking STUPID. Bump Stocks make it easer for some nut to kill massively. Semi automatics make it easier for some nut to kill massively. ARE YOU SOME KIND OF NUT? Is that why you want our kids DEAD and are so strongly against reasonable safety measures and regulations
331 2018-02-15 22:38:48 They can start with easy things - universal background checks, removing the GOP ban on studying gun violence issues, banning bump stocks, keeping folks with mental illness from buying weapons, keeping domestic abusers from buying weapons, etc.

LOTS of things that GOP blocks

334 2018-02-15 22:38:15 Understanding how to place trades and the #'s on a price scroll doesn't inherently make me choose the stocks that are will make money. Knowing how a firearm works and how to shoot accurately doesn't make you able to prevent misuse more than if it wasn't in the home to begin with.
335 2018-02-15 22:38:08 No maga isn't an insult.  
It's, a, way of life. 
And if you need me to go over every option then you aren't helping. 
After Vegas 90% of America was on board for banning bump stocks. 
Never happened
336 2018-02-15 22:37:44 didn't you approve bump stocks?...
337 2018-02-15 22:37:42 Some Dems in #MTAL U.S. House primary race are coming out in favor of limits on assault weapons, bump stocks after #ParklandSchoolShooting
338 2018-02-15 22:37:33 #NRAwhore Your time is up.  Congress needs to sign a pledge NEVER to accept donations from the NRA and never to entertain NRA lobbyists. America wants a ban on assault weapons & bump stocks. America wants background checks. 1st strip the power Congress has given to the NRA!
339 2018-02-15 22:37:30 I agree with you Ty and I’d also like a nationwide ban on suppressors and bump stocks.
340 2018-02-15 22:37:18 I agree with pretty much all of those. But idk how you will do background checks on private individuals. There are some states who already do that. After the Vegas shooting people have been working or passed idk on laws to outlaw bump stocks
341 2018-02-15 22:36:35 #NRAwhore Your time is up.  Congress needs to sign a pledge NEVER to accept donations from the NRA and never to entertain NRA lobbyists. America wants a ban on assault weapons & bump stocks. America wants background checks. 1st strip the power Congress has given to the NRA!
342 2018-02-15 22:36:07 Sure. And ban “assault rifles” and bump stocks. I’m all for it. It’s a ceremonial bandaid that will accomplish nothing! Spend years for that legislation that won’t save any lives but it should be done. If one wants to cause mass damage, they’ll find a way.
343 2018-02-15 22:35:32 @IronStache Ryan takes @nra $ while he refuses to hold a vote on

Banning Bump Stocks
Preventing the mentally ill from purchasing guns
Preventing people on no-fly lists from buying guns
Take. His. Seat.
344 2018-02-15 22:35:20 Mental health is part of it. Gun legislation that is common sense is needed i.e. banning bump stocks. Mental health is deteriorated by exposure to chemicals. Pollution has now caught up with us. There are trend lines everywhere that support this argument.
345 2018-02-15 22:35:17 Universal background checks including private owners and gun show sales, mental health diagnoses for possible harm to self or others (not just banning anyone with issues cuz we all go through bad stuff), bump stocks and high capacity mags.
346 2018-02-15 22:35:13 No one wants your gun. Get over it. Assault Weapons like the AR-15 needs to be banned again. People in other civilized countries have mental health problems, they don't have AR-15s or bump stocks.

350 2018-02-15 22:34:46 @MTP @chucktodd   What is with your guests? Police, armed guards, teachers with guns.  What, are we all under a police state? NO NO NO. Get rid of guns. More guns means more deaths. Ban AR-15's and bump stocks for a start. Let's get smart, not armed. Is not the U.S. educated?
351 2018-02-15 22:34:41 5 waves down. Perhaps a little further to go, but risk is a rally to at least 94, perhaps as high as a 100. Doubt so high given the impact to Stocks but you never know.

353 2018-02-15 22:34:11 Using absolutes is fun isn’t it? How about making restrictions to magazine size, eliminating bumper stocks or silencers or some pragmatic approaches? No? Too hard to argue?
354 2018-02-15 22:34:02 
If pple want to think by adding fed countrywide background checks or banning bump stocks that means all guns will be taken then TOO BAD for them. I don't care what they think. Most of them are the same pple who believe in the Deep State & Obama is a Muslim.
355 2018-02-15 22:33:25 If you look at a TLT monthly chart, a broken bear flag is obvious.  I think the TLT reaches to 102 area.  But, money will go somewhere and some will go to stocks.  In 1987 crash, 30 yr bond yielded 8%.

They pretty much simulate automatics
358 2018-02-15 22:32:07 Some of it I don't know how you fix because the proverbial cat is out of the bag but some of the gun accessories are completely unnecessary ie massive clips, bump stocks, etc. Some of it actually having a functional background system where info isn't forgotten to be entered 1/2.

365 2018-02-15 22:29:25 Guess no one cares about bump stocks today
366 2018-02-15 22:29:23 Real interest rates should stay negative as the Fed raises rates,  creating a buying opportunity for gold, “If an unqualified spike in inflation were to come out, gold should sell off…gold should react the same way as stocks in the short term.
367 2018-02-15 22:29:16 Here’s a start. Ban bump stocks. Let’s start there. Thoughts?
368 2018-02-15 22:28:39 And making possession illegal—all assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. No sales, no purchases and no possession! Treat assault weapons like marijuana.
369 2018-02-15 22:28:37 What would be so difficult about EXTENSIVE background checks, banning military grade weapons and bump stocks, waiting periods, reinstating the mental health ban, etc? It’s common sense. But not what the NRA wants so it won’t happen.

374 2018-02-15 22:26:26 No. It doesn't begin to "say it all" because it didn't end at bump stocks.  Gun grabbers started throwing in all sorts of other stipulations and that's what got it killed.

And the gun grabbers KNEW it would kill it, so they did it to poison the well on purpose.

376 2018-02-15 22:26:13 We have to flip the Congress.  Republicans wouldn’t even vote to ban someone on a terrorist list from getting guns.  And bump stocks are still legal. So we have to
377 2018-02-15 22:25:54 Of course it’s complicated or we would have resolved it after the first school shooting. With that said this is the same rationale being used to keep bump stocks legal, so we need to continue the dialogue, to which I’m hearing more talk about gun training, which I like.
378 2018-02-15 22:25:23 Yeah, things really suck. I'm getting more money in my paycheck, my stocks are up and the treason of the last administration is slowly being chiseled away. Congratulations, you can look up a website. That's probably the most militaristic thing you've done in your life.
379 2018-02-15 22:25:10 Message from @NRA supporters via @HowardFineman is that most gun owners support theories of gun regs & enforcing current laws, banning bump stocks & military-grade guns, but they think giving an inch on any  means "taking our guns away".  So they'll accept all these deaths.
380 2018-02-15 22:25:07 See - that, right there. Banning assault weapons or bump stocks or silencers or trying to require background checks at gun shows gets immediately equated to ALL gun rights being revoked!  It's nonsense.
381 2018-02-15 22:24:57 As usual you are a moron with no standing offering no solutions just platitudes; thoughts and prayers. Then pray to become more intelligent and come up with common sense gun laws. The cowards in the Republican Party can not even pass a law to ban bump stocks @realDonaldTrump

383 2018-02-15 22:24:05 Ideally, I would like to see the right to bear arms removed, thats not gonna happen . There are infinite methods to improve what we already have. First, ban "bump stocks" so you cant quickly turn a semi-automatic to a fully auto weapon which increases effect by a large margin

391 2018-02-15 22:21:50 RE: the comments I already made about bump stocks. Also, the nature of semi-autos make them far from “civilian weapons”. Many of these guns’ creators agree with this. 

And they’re not civilian weapons. They were specifically designed by Stoner for the U.S. military.
392 2018-02-15 22:21:45 Did you learn how to mouth empty sentiments from Trump, or does it come naturally?

What are you actually going to DO to make a difference? There are lots of constructive steps you can take: improve bkgnd checks, close gun show loopholes, ban assault rifles and bump stocks, etc.
393 2018-02-15 22:21:33 I also support banning bump stocks, extended clips, silencers, and stronger regulation of people engaged in domestic violence even if it does not rise to a felony.

418 2018-02-15 22:15:46 Don't trust the word of the NRA. They saw what these bump stocks can do. Why didn't they just stop selling them. Show they have a spect of hunanity left.
419 2018-02-15 22:15:46 We couldn’t even get bump stocks banned, there’s no hope for reform. But there are other ways we can address this issue, and we should focus on them because they provide immediate security to these soft targets
420 2018-02-15 22:14:24 As a mother, I am horrified that any school child is shot by an assault rifle; as a Democratic legislator, I will push to regulate sales of bump stocks, and assault rifles whenever and however possible #GunReformNow
421 2018-02-15 22:14:22 That's a start. Next we need to ban assault rifles and what happened to banning bump stocks?? That was completely ignored. Every step helps!
422 2018-02-15 22:14:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
423 2018-02-15 22:14:07 It didn't pass because the morons presenting the law took something that was an issue (bump stocks) and tried to equate it with things that weren't issues (suppressors).
I wish they'd just gotten the bump stocks taken care of.
424 2018-02-15 22:14:05 Why is it California will go against the federal law and allow the sale of marijuana in state licensed shops, but we need the federal government to do something as simple as ban the sale of bump-stocks?  Why didn't congress ban the sale of bump-stocks after Las Vegas?
425 2018-02-15 22:13:56 Praying is not going to stop the killing..action to change the laws to BAN assault and semi AUTOMATIC and devices like bump stocks is going to make a difference..what if one of your kids was in that school and killed would that not change your mind to do something?
426 2018-02-15 22:13:52 Stocks are for rich ppl. those "fucking idiots" are gonna get shafted soon enough. How are your stocks holding up? Do you have healthcare? Gonna retire? Any pre-existing conditions?
427 2018-02-15 22:13:37 I can be a pragmatist. Within the framework of 2A I am for handgun possession for self-defense/rifles for hunting but against laws like FL's Stand Your Ground law, semi-automatics, & gun stocks. But long term I prefer to repeal & replace 2A with a new clearer amendment.

429 2018-02-15 22:13:14 If that’s true, why aren’t more mass murders being committed with illegally obtained fully automatic weapons then?

Why did the LV shooter instead opt to purchase semi-auto assault rifles legally and use bump-stocks to simulate automatic fire?

It doesn’t add up...
430 2018-02-15 22:13:09 Ban the bump stocks that turn semi automatic weapons into automatic weapons.
431 2018-02-15 22:13:05 Universal background checks? Banning bump stocks? Anything at all???
432 2018-02-15 22:12:54 They can start with easy things - universal background checks, removing the GOP ban on studying gun violence issues, banning bump stocks, keeping folks with mental illness from buying weapons, keeping domestic abusers from buying weapons, etc.

LOTS of things that GOP blocks

438 2018-02-15 22:11:32 You take money from the NRA. Is that so lots of AR-15s  and bump stocks and high capacity magazines can be sold so our students across the country can be gunned down quickly and efficiently?

3. Ordinary citizens don't need a stockpile of guns, AR's or bump stocks.

441 2018-02-15 22:10:49 They want us to forget.  They did nothing to ban bump stocks.  We need to demand change.  Assault weapons were designed to kill people.

446 2018-02-15 22:09:13 @MarcoARubioRBLX Things government can do: UNIVERSAL background checks.  BAN bump stocks that turn semi auto rifles into machine guns. FULLY fund mental health support programs. STOP people on government no fly list from buying guns without extensive extra screening.
447 2018-02-15 22:08:52 If no one has the guts to ban assault style weapons, how about we:

- impose a 50 cent tax on each and every bullet sold. Use money to help improve school safety
- ban large magazines so they reload more often.
- ban bump stocks so hundreds can't get mowed down like in Vegas.
448 2018-02-15 22:08:48 @FLGovScott Things government can do: UNIVERSAL background checks.  BAN bump stocks that turn semi auto rifles into machine guns. FULLY fund mental health support programs. STOP people on government no fly list from buying guns without extensive extra screening.

460 2018-02-15 22:05:19 Point is you can keep your amendment, but if we ever get legislatures that want to curb these killings due to semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks, laws will be put in place to stop the manufacture and sale of semi-automatic citizenry.  Just like fully automatics.

469 2018-02-15 22:03:33 I personally believe bump stocks should be made illegal since they circumvent laws on the books against fully autos. AR-15s should probably be restricted to non private sales with 21+. That’s just my opinion.
470 2018-02-15 22:03:06 How about supporting universal background checks, a ban on bump stocks and automatic weapons?
471 2018-02-15 22:02:09 The gun laws in Florida are VERY lax, and they're considering legislation to make it even easier to get them. They're barely trying! Who enforces these laws? All levels of law enforcement, just like every other law. How are they enforced? Close the loopholes, ban bump stocks, ...
472 2018-02-15 22:01:58 Also, why do we need those to hunt?  The animal would be destroyed.  Or does the hunter have bad eyesight?  Next:  bump stocks: legal; extended clips: legal.  So please tell me; who is as fault here?  I believe in the 2nd Amendment but I also believe in common sense laws.
473 2018-02-15 22:01:57 That's because DNC wouldn't take yes for an answer on bump stocks and wanted to turn it into a gun control omnibus that included magazine caps, ammunition restrictions, etc.
474 2018-02-15 22:01:43 For me it’s important that the clothing stocks sizes to suit petite women. And of course, they’ve gotta be colourful and Jazzy. We need some more fun injected into golf and that can definitely be done through clothing 
475 2018-02-15 22:01:07 No assault rifles for regular citizens. No guns for people on any type of watch list. No bump stocks. No private sales. No gun show sales. No license until you go through a background check without a minimum waiting period. Computerize all files that help with background checks.
476 2018-02-15 22:01:04 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-02-15, is 354.94. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space
477 2018-02-15 22:01:02 How about introducing legislation tomorrow to ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines? Honor victims by limiting their number!
478 2018-02-15 22:00:57 Thought they might put him in the stocks.
479 2018-02-15 22:00:49 Thanks guys. U give Fed a lot of credit, but Janet, Stan & Dudley will b gone . I don't dismiss Tudor Jones' view that yields r going higher, at least till they steal money from stocks, bonds & commodities
480 2018-02-15 22:00:27 Now is the time to use the power of the executive order. Ban Bump Stocks. Require stronger background checks. Reinstate #BarackObama gun order. Move now. And you may be able to maintain your job. If you do not you will not.
481 2018-02-15 21:59:23 Getting rid of bump stocks and semi-automatic assault rifles won’t stop gun violence, but it will stop mass shootings. You can never stop all violence, but you can stop the violence that will cause mass casualties.
482 2018-02-15 21:59:19 We haven't even gotten bump stocks taken off the shelves after Vegas. The only gun law change that's been made is that a conceal & carry license given out in 1 state is now good in every state.
483 2018-02-15 21:59:07 Can we talk about Orlando, Las Vegas or Texas Church killing now? It’s well pass the 24hrs. Remember the conversation about bump stocks. Nothing happened. NRA owns you.
484 2018-02-15 21:58:49 @SpeakerRyan We must ban the weapons that are being used in mass shootings- semiautomatic rifles, large magazines & bump-stocks. What legal uses do these weapons have? Better to inconvenience a few people than continuing slaughtering children & people! Stop rolling over for #NRA!
485 2018-02-15 21:58:42 ALL shootings can be said to be linked to ‘mental health’. That does NOT solve issue of AR-15’s, bump stocks & clips that hold 50 rounds being available to civilians. WE MUST HAVE SENSIBLE GUN CONTROL! CALL YR SENATORS/HOUSE REPS 202-225-3121. Do this or lose yr seat!!
486 2018-02-15 21:58:37 it's probably because natural resource industries are a large part of the TSX, and stocks in those industries tend to have volatile charts
487 2018-02-15 21:58:07 The democrats added things to the bill that had nothing to do with bump stocks. Imagine why it didn’t pass.
488 2018-02-15 21:57:48 Yeah man semi automatic, bump stocks etc. Need to be phased out of gun shops. You should only be able to buy Shotguns and very limited ammo. And only allowed to buy ammo like every 3months at most.
489 2018-02-15 21:57:37 Since you have not yet responded to my earlier tweet, I will try again. As a fellow father, I beg you to draft legislation to ban private ownership of assault weapons and bump stocks. I do support handgun ownership for self-protection. Thanks for your service. #ParklandShooting
490 2018-02-15 21:57:35 How fast the gun is capable of firing w/o a reload. You know, like the workarounds people us like bump stocks, etc. What's the point of banning automatic weapons if people are allowed to modify them to act as one?
491 2018-02-15 21:57:35 It took a pic of a black eye to convince the WH the victim was real. Will it take autopsy pics of those beautiful kids to convince congress to act & not just offer prayers. let's talk about this later was said after Las Vegas. No laws against bump stocks yet! #FloridaStrong
492 2018-02-15 21:57:34 This makes me sick. 
1. Ban AR-15s. 
2. Ban high capacity magazines.
3. Ban bump stocks.
4. Defy the NRA. Who the hell is running this country?
5. Require minimum age for gun purchases, as well as safety courses and psychological screening.
6. Stop with the “thoughts & prayers.”
493 2018-02-15 21:57:12 "One of the occupational hazards of being a final expert is being cornered at parties by people who are eager to explain their system for making creamy profits by investing in common stocks. Fortunately, these bores go into temporary hibernation whenever the market goes down."
494 2018-02-15 21:57:03 You're definitely not a rocket scientist, Rob. Another way to look at it is what if we treated guns like cars? You have to pass a test, re-certify, carry insurance. Add universal bg checks, ban bump stocks. Common sense stuff that would save lives.
495 2018-02-15 21:57:01 funding research, banning bump stocks, limit magazine rounds, eliminate armor piercing bullets, money for mental health, strengthen background checks, money for school resource officers, additional tools to law enforcement, ban assault rifles
496 2018-02-15 21:56:53 You passed a law that shared mental health data with law enforcement. You can't pass a bill banning bump stocks. You won't repeal the Dickey Amendment. You're complicit.
497 2018-02-15 21:54:57 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-14, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (6/6):
498 2018-02-15 21:54:56 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-14, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (6/6):
499 2018-02-15 21:54:47 Bump stocks let AR-15s be fired fully automatic for the low price of 135 and are completely legal.
500 2018-02-15 21:54:18 $NFLX 100% from lows put the stocks at new all time highs $287 - $294 and could lead the move higher for $AMZN #Elliottwave $XLY
501 2018-02-15 21:53:50 Yet, he was legally allowed to buy a deadly semiautomatic rifle! @GOP @realDonaldTrump are to blame. Bump stocks, large magazines & military style weapons must be banned now! Better to inconvenience a few hunters that continually have innocent people slaughtered.
502 2018-02-15 21:53:49 What about the Republicans not passing a bill that would prevent a person with a mental illness from buying a gun. They refused to ban bump stocks. GOP ARE BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY THE NRA .
503 2018-02-15 21:53:40 Oh, and the Las Vegas guy wouldn’t have had bump stocks either
504 2018-02-15 21:53:32 Don’t be so dramatic. Can’t buy a gun if on any sort of list-this kid had been reported to the FBI. Ongoing mental health issues, any domestic violence issue, no bump stocks. Mental health care improvements...just to name a few. Why is this so bad??
505 2018-02-15 21:53:18 They’re ALL mentally disturbed for god’s sake!!You need to keep the assault rifles & bump stocks out of their reach. Enough is enough!! We need stricter gun laws, National registries for all gun owners, ban assault weapons. Pretty soon you’re going 2B facing major civil unrest.
506 2018-02-15 21:53:08 #mnleg Gun bills - be informed. "A bill filed last week by Rep. John Considine, DFL-Mankato, would make “slide-fire” or “bump” stocks illegal, by classifying them as “trigger activators.” #ThumbsUp
507 2018-02-15 21:53:00 @SenToomey you and every other legislator that did nothing after Vegas are just as responsible for this as the shooter. Stop kowtowing to the NRA and ban assault rifles & bump stocks...track magazine purchases like you do Sudafed for chrissakes!
508 2018-02-15 21:52:53 There is nothing legally sold, that alters the one bullet per finger pull. IF it did, the weapon would become an automatic weapon and from that point would be illegal. Bump stocks make you pull the trigger extremely fast, but its still just one bullet per finger pull.
509 2018-02-15 21:52:37 I lost 5.88$ from my stocks. 
Definitely hit me hard. 
510 2018-02-15 21:52:37 No puedo estar más de acuerdo con @lluistolosa . Por favor, basta de pasear a los turistas entre stocks de vino, maquinaria y acero inoxidable!!! #Enoturismo
511 2018-02-15 21:52:36 What about bump stocks?  Why do civilians need AR-15’s to protect themselves??  The blood of those children and teachers are on  YOUR hands.  May the images of their faces be seared into your mind as you continue to collect NRA $
512 2018-02-15 21:52:17 We need common sense laws. No guns for mentally unstable people, no semi automatics that fire off rounds quickly, no bump stocks,
513 2018-02-15 21:52:07 Definition of assault rifle varies. Bump stocks are largely a novelty and I have no issue getting rid of them. The misunderstanding many Americans have of ballistics and the lethality of certain firearms creates chaos in the conversation. Insurance? Very interesting idea.
514 2018-02-15 21:52:01 To broaden out a bit.  BO Stocks are lower than last year, dollar is down, crude oil is up, beans and meal are up from this time last year.  Yet bean oil is down?
515 2018-02-15 21:51:37 There were no assault weapons when the Constitution was drafted.  I beleve in the right to bear arms, but there has to be a caveat. And you know damn well cars and vans, at least to date, do limited % of these acts. Start with these bump stocks.
516 2018-02-15 21:50:53 NO ACTUALLY we don't have the laws to prevent what happened yesterday in West Fort Lauderdale. Actually our CONGRESS, After the Las Vegas murders, could NOT Even agree to pass a law against "BUMP STOCKS;"  that turns a legally purchased 'AR-15' semi-automatic INTO A FULL-AUTO!!
517 2018-02-15 21:50:50 They’re about cryptocurrency (almost like stocks). My bad, you may wanna mute me. Lmaoooo 
518 2018-02-15 21:50:38 Assault rifles / extended clips / bump stocks / silencers / hollow points / lead rounds / get them out of my country.
519 2018-02-15 21:50:35 It took a pic of a black eye to convince the WH the victim was real. Will it take autopsy pics of those beautiful kids to convince congress to act & not just offer prayers. let's talk about this later was said after Las Vegas. No laws against bump stocks yet! #FloridaStrong

521 2018-02-15 21:49:24 That is total & complete BS & U know it. Reps who vote down gun control laws take the responsibility. They wouldn't even consider bans on bump stocks after the Vegas shooting. Give me a break. Vote for candidates who support gun control.
522 2018-02-15 21:49:13 @ProudResister  I'd retweet your great tweet about banning assault weapons (please also add, bump stocks and silencers [there's a Bill to allow these, the Fuckers!!!], but @Twitter decided to block my retweeting ability after I was retweeting all tweets from @sharethefacts!
523 2018-02-15 21:49:10 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-14, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (5/6):
524 2018-02-15 21:49:07 They can comply but they will be voted out. Enough carnage. People kill but people kill a lot more and an lot faster with guns, especially semi-automatics or semi-automatics with bump stocks to essentially make them into automatics for all intents and purposes.
525 2018-02-15 21:49:02 It starts at home.  Fix our own house before bringing success story to DC.  BANN ASSAULT WEAPONS/PUMP STOCKS HERE!  Talk to your Massachusetts constituents while you're in DC...they did it and stats went from 128 to 2
526 2018-02-15 21:48:57 “reach out” ??? Why not sponsor some legislation regarding background checks, banning bump stocks, increase wait times on obtaining assault rifles.  FL high school students are demanding action, not talk
527 2018-02-15 21:48:50 I know there are other means to commit mass murder. Cars, airplanes, etc. However, let me ask this, do we really need AR-15s or even bump stocks? Is it necessary to own one? I, myself, can't imagine why I would need a rifle of the caliber in my home.
528 2018-02-15 21:48:49 They supported restrictions on bump stocks following the Vegas shooting

#GunReformNow
530 2018-02-15 21:48:17 Bump stocks are illegal.
531 2018-02-15 21:47:36 the problem is.....USA is awash with guns. Who the fuck is going to take them all away? It's no use banning the sale of AR15's and Bump stocks, or even making it harder to legally obtain any gun. There's just too many out there already.
532 2018-02-15 21:47:29 Let’s start there. Clearly they are the first choice of maniacs with the intent to harm. And then we sell stocks that turn them automatic?
533 2018-02-15 21:47:20 Stocks to look out for in the future : Amazon, Facebook and Nvidia - With the influence of AI in the coming of age
534 2018-02-15 21:47:20 @themotleyfool Why do you Hate Chipotle so much? Do you own Monsanto stocks?  Have you ever written a positive piece on Chipotle?
535 2018-02-15 21:46:48 I never realized that until somebody made a meme about it.  Its only noticeable in the fashionable desert color stocks.  I still prefer black though.
536 2018-02-15 21:46:39 Spare me... Trump & GOP Congress’ will not change gun laws as long as the NRA funds their campaigns.   Think I’m wrong, show me what they’ve done since LV to ban bump stocks and assault weapons, stop ability of mentally ill to buy guns, install metal detectors in schools etc
537 2018-02-15 21:46:34 Making the age for purchase 25 instead of 18.

Returning to Obama era rules on mental health/dropping the Trump EO.

Strengthening the laws regarding bump stocks.
538 2018-02-15 21:46:30 Another strong day for stocks... 5th day in a row of stocks in the green!!!

540 2018-02-15 21:45:57 I heard like 5 people turned in their bump stocks in New York... I'm sure a buyback would go swimmingly...
541 2018-02-15 21:45:41 Penny stocks were the bastion of pump 'n dump schemes and now crypto is the domain of eager suckers to dump on
542 2018-02-15 21:45:39 No, I haven't written about it. Less than 1% of my stock market investments are in individual dividend stocks. But you don't have to choose between index funds and dividends. A significant portion of my index funds are dividend funds.
543 2018-02-15 21:45:18 The NRA won’t compromise on ANY of these:
14 day waiting period
No sales by private owners
No sales at gun shows
10 rounds magazine limit
No bump stocks
Licenses for all arms
Child lock requirements
Minimum age of 21
Assault rifle ban
background checks
Domestic violence ban
544 2018-02-15 21:45:17 Is this why there's a fight to get rid of bump stocks, silencers and background checks for mentally ill? What's that excuse?
545 2018-02-15 21:45:13 Exposure to #GOLD is very different to exposure to gold stocks.
546 2018-02-15 21:45:09 Families need to know their kids will be safe at school. Period. There are commonsense things we CAN do now to dramatically lessen this violence:
-Let CDC study gun violence
-Increase $$ for mental health services
-Require universal background checks
-Ban bump stocks
547 2018-02-15 21:44:41 Invest in #crypto and #stocks then put a % of your profits into #realestate
548 2018-02-15 21:44:28 We must vote against politicians who accept donations from the NRA to get this perverted, corrupt defense of automatic weapons, bump stocks, and other destructive weapons. No other nations have our rate of gun carnage #BloodOnYourHandsGOP
549 2018-02-15 21:43:41 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-14, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (4/6):

551 2018-02-15 21:43:26 Well, bully for you. What does that have to do with the fact that AR-15s and bump stocks don't belong in the hands of civilians?
552 2018-02-15 21:42:52 While innocent children are murdered trying to get an education, some douche with gun stocks is making money off a massacre because people buy guns out of fear.
I’m not even sure what’s more gross.
553 2018-02-15 21:42:49 So one of my best investments so far in stock was buying $1000 worth of stock a few years ago of Activision Blizzard, now its worth 3k! plus dividend yields. I just wish I would have held on to some other stocks in the past, i would have made bank
554 2018-02-15 21:42:31 @SpeakerRyan Your rhetoric is hyperbolic and untrue. Common sense gun control including background checks with mental illness circumstance, ban of bump stocks, AR-15 weapons is widely supported You are a corrupt NRA-hired shill
555 2018-02-15 21:42:25 I'll comment on this. 

She has a strong ground game without stocks. Somewhat weak air game. With air stocks she has a very strong ground and air neutral. Strong conversions such as 3B > Vanish as well. Good pressure and very high damage.
556 2018-02-15 21:42:22 You needa talk about it bud?
557 2018-02-15 21:42:11 If they wouldn't even ban bump-stocks then they're never gonna do anything

The NRA pumps enough $ into Republicans' pockets that they couldn't care less.
558 2018-02-15 21:42:04 Yes but I can still modify it to be fully automatic by anonymously purchasing the parts online. That throws the ban out the window. Also, bump stocks. I own an AR, so I understand mechanically what is possible
559 2018-02-15 21:41:31 Coming back to Limerick very soon. Nothing planned but it will happen soon. Most likely in the wonderful @Chez_Le_Fab on Arthurs Quay. #LimerickHour #Networking #BarryJayHughes. They have some of my music for sale there actually. Need to replenish them stocks too I'm told.
560 2018-02-15 21:41:07 Donald T:
Here is a way to guarantee a favorable legacy. Take the steps to rid our country of assault rifles and bump stocks. Even more to stroke your needy ego, if you develop a way to have sensible background checks, they will give you a great library to salute you as the one >
561 2018-02-15 21:40:33 Even the bump stocks are legal. That’s my overall point. The argument is always “Criminals will have access to whatever they want anyway!” Which is provably wrong. Why didn’t they use C4 and nuclear weapons in that case? They always use legal weapons because they’re easy to get.
562 2018-02-15 21:40:30 Never thought we can legislate our way to solving all society’s problems. I do believe in action.  For me that means no bump stocks, enhanced background checks, mandatory gun safety classes. Driving in this country is a privilege that requires training. Why not gun ownership?
563 2018-02-15 21:40:29 There no reason for anyone to have automatic assault rifles or bump-stocks unless they are in the military in a war zone. If every single member of Congress regardless of political party chose to vote to ban these weapons then the NRA would lose their hold over them. #parkland
564 2018-02-15 21:40:23 Cut-down in that automatic and three-burst modes found in the M-16 are removed. But they found a rudimentary way around that with bump stocks too.
565 2018-02-15 21:40:22 I #adulted so hard today. Bought 6k worth of #stocks and picked up #dogshit.
566 2018-02-15 21:39:56 @TSprings11 an index fund holds stocks/bonds but the same ones as the next fund. @cfraresearch publishes 2-3/week on this.
567 2018-02-15 21:39:21 On a brighter note, I see stocks are climbing again...I think we can all agree that’s a good thing
568 2018-02-15 21:39:07 #Bitcoin dropped below 10k, it’s dead. #crypto is dead. Sell now, go buy stocks or atleast scratch offs. You’ll have a better chance to make money.
569 2018-02-15 21:38:48 Clare - the vast majority of our fin fish stocks are shared (or “straddle”) stocks that also spread to other nations’ waters. Any quota for such stocks has to be negotiated with other nations. Norway has to do this
570 2018-02-15 21:38:37 Yes, please get your party to take action, or your constituents will.  Ban assault rifles to begin with.  Ban bump stocks. Our children have the right to live.
571 2018-02-15 21:38:10 More post-rationalisation. So once Market Share narrative imploded, what better way to explain failed Inventory Reduction narrative than to say buffer stocks aren't REALLY inventory & anyway it's all part of a cunning plan. Couldn't make it up. Actually they could & did  #OOTT
572 2018-02-15 21:37:44 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-14, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (3/6):

574 2018-02-15 21:37:33 As long as NRAs money is how congressmen and women vote. Then we’ll here a lot of condolences today with empty promises. Remember bunt stocks? Ryan nor McConnell has brought nothing to the floor.
575 2018-02-15 21:37:16 #democrats the best gun salesman ever. Check gun stocks in the morning
576 2018-02-15 21:36:54 AR15’s and bump stocks would be a great start. Military style weapons do not need to be in our communities
577 2018-02-15 21:36:30 Do YOU shoot? Do YOU know the original purpose of bump stocks? As usual the ROOT CAUSE is being ignored! Of course, you are “out”! Losing the argument and you know it!
578 2018-02-15 21:36:26 Ban bayo, customs for miis (or one custom per character), 2 stocks, ban lylat
579 2018-02-15 21:36:25 If no one has the guts to ban assault style weapons, how about we:

- impose a 50 cent tax on each and every bullet sold. Use money to help improve school safety
- ban large magazines so they reload more often.
- ban bump stocks so hundreds can't get mowed down like in Vegas.
580 2018-02-15 21:35:58 @RepHarrisKy @WillCoursey Chris & Will, I appreciate your transparent, thoughtful and courageous sentiments expressed today on the floor of the Kentucky General Assembly in regards to guns & the need to ban certain semi automatic rifles, bump stocks & close certain gun loopholes.
581 2018-02-15 21:35:41 Automatic weapons are already banned in the united states, but the capacity to make weapons automatic like bump stocks arent. Assault weapons are a bit of a different story tho
582 2018-02-15 21:35:33 When no 1 wants 2 take away guns but better b/ g checks.limit amount & no bump stocks/assault rifles see no reasoning not to do it
583 2018-02-15 21:35:31 Just found out Walmart stocks my book 
584 2018-02-15 21:35:07 While it wouldn't have worked in this situation it may have in others, making legislation makes obtaining the items harder in cases where they were legally obtained, like who really needs bump stocks? What is your solution then? The solution isn't more guns or continuing as is.
585 2018-02-15 21:35:06 here in brazil are increasing the foreigners buying stocks, yours are coming here.
586 2018-02-15 21:34:53 Awesome. Very clever. See, if I were Fed, I wld want to slow down train right now. I don't want a run. Where's money gonna come from to pay for all that issuance? From spending itself? From stocks & corporates? Abroad?
587 2018-02-15 21:34:48 Is feel good legislation. Bump stocks are not necessary for bump firing.
588 2018-02-15 21:34:46 @IronStache needs to make this a part of his campaign that Speaker of the House wants to make the country less safe by keeping assault weapons,bump stocks, and his agreement that Mentally Ill should own guns.

590 2018-02-15 21:34:27 Right !  Could put metal detectors up then they would shoot ppl on buses , quit selling guns to mentally ill ppl !
Make mental illness part of BG check ! These two would help some , also remove 30 rd clips and bump stocks . – bij Andrew Jackson's Hermitage: Home of the People's President

592 2018-02-15 21:34:07 Had conversation w/neighbors earlier today. Both are serious gun owners. They hunt, trap shoot & own multiple types of guns. One is NRA member, other quit after Sandy Hook. *Both* agree gun control is needed: no AR-15s, no bump stocks, background checks & waiting periods.
593 2018-02-15 21:34:01 Repeal the 2nd Amendment? Or are we talking about “common sense gun control”? Magazine limits? Cosmetic regulations on folding stocks and barrel lengths? Mythical gun show loopholes? What exactly is it that we all know?
594 2018-02-15 21:32:24 No federal ban on assault rifles or bump stocks even after #VegasShooting and now massacre on children in #FloridaSchoolShooting!!! This has to stop!! @realDonaldTrump step down and @NRA rot in hell
595 2018-02-15 21:32:15 Shut up Tomi. You are politicizing this with this tweet.  It’s people that want stricter gun controls, universal background checks, no assault rifles, no bump stocks- this isn’t about the 2nd amendment, it’s right and wrong.
You’re an irrelevant mouthpiece.
596 2018-02-15 21:32:10 It's a toy. It was reportedly used in Las Vegas and that probably made the shooter considerably less accurate. Look them up on YouTube. Marksmen value control. Bump stocks don't enhance control.
597 2018-02-15 21:32:08 Does your sadness & horrification spur any action?
1) ban assault weapons, bump stocks, & pass reasonable gun laws
2) make sure every school has funding for safety measures
3)make sure all have access affordable healthcare/ mental health services?

If not, does your tweet matter?
598 2018-02-15 21:32:04 Never occurs to these cretins that low fish stocks are because of human overfishing, not too many seals.
599 2018-02-15 21:31:29 Actually, they’re anti-bump stock (which im guessing is what you meant by number stocks)

They’re pro-background checks as well.

Really... you need to educate yourself a bit on the ACTUAL stances of the NRA.

603 2018-02-15 21:31:13 Dear Congress, 
Please vote to ban all assault rifles and bump stocks, demand background checks for all gun purchases, and please keep all guns away from mentally ill patients. Require gun safety classes. Label radical white supremacy groups as terrorists while you are at it.
604 2018-02-15 21:30:51 Iyou Senator Durbin but whatcha going to do?

2) make sure every school has funding for safety measures

607 2018-02-15 21:30:39 You also don't need AR-15s, 30 round clips, and bump stocks to protect yourself. If you can't hit an intruder with a 6 shot revolver you've likely hit some innocent bystander.
608 2018-02-15 21:30:39 What’s hole which all of these people in?  Unemployment has changed to the lowest, companies are flocking back, taxes reforms give more money back to the working class, and stocks are still in the ups?  Another disaster polters, and statistics?

614 2018-02-15 21:28:46 #GunSenseNow #GunControlNow @GOP @NRA @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan you have blood on your hands. Another school shooting yet assault rifles, bump stocks and high capacity magazines are legal. Shame on you
615 2018-02-15 21:28:35 Nope, there are no laws on bump-stocks etc. Even after Vegas, not a hypothetical risk but a real carnage, nobody did anything. It is embarrassing.
616 2018-02-15 21:28:35 Im sorry for their loss and it is a tragedy. BUMP stocks should be illegal. Even NRA wants to ban them. And i have to disagree. Guns dont kill people. People kill people.
617 2018-02-15 21:28:16 As a gun owner, FU. Enough is enough, I don't want to send my kids to school in flak jackets. If you need an AR15 to hunt deer, then you ought not be hunting deer! Bump stocks and high capacity mags, no hunter needs that shit either. That's just for carnage!
618 2018-02-15 21:28:05 Horrified enough to take a stand stating WE will:
1) ban assault weapons & bump stocks AND pass reasonable gun laws
2) make sure every school has funding for safety measures
3)to make sure all people have access affordable healthcare/ mental health services?

If not, be quiet!
619 2018-02-15 21:28:00 1) Stop the selling of weapons like the AR-15 that are easily modifiable 
2) Stop the selling of bumper stocks
3) Force background checks for all gun and ammo purchases
4) Mandatory waiting period for all gun purchases
5) Mandatory gun registry to the local police and ATF
620 2018-02-15 21:27:56 Bump stocks?
621 2018-02-15 21:27:40 The AR-15 fires 45 rounds per second. Bump stocks make them fully automatic. Unlike a regular old handgun but what do I know?
No need for these guns outside of a battlefield.
622 2018-02-15 21:27:33 This is a ridiculous article the senate introduced two separate bills on gun control after Sandy Hook. They both failed to pass. BTW bump stocks are still legal. Can we start with that?
623 2018-02-15 21:27:30 @realDonaldTrump WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO STOP BUMP STOCKS?
624 2018-02-15 21:27:24 Who would have thought Ash Wednesday was the best time to buy stocks?

627 2018-02-15 21:26:42 We must end loopholes in the background checks system, finally pass a bill to crack down on bump stocks, and preserve current protections against gun silencers.

Start the clock – our work in Congress begins in 365 days."
628 2018-02-15 21:26:36 Republicans love money from their campaign contributions from the COMPLICIT @NRA more than the lives of people taken from using AR-15 and bump stocks. They still haven't done anything about bump stocks since the Las Vegas massacre. Vote these VILE republicans out #2018 #2020
629 2018-02-15 21:26:08 @MichaelKors I'm trying to get hold of an activity tracker, one of the silver ones  (not the bangle style) any ideas where stocks them local to kent? Thanks
630 2018-02-15 21:26:01 Dave, you are worried about AIG type risk?  They were bailed out. It’s not a risk anymore. The fed will step in for counterparty risk. End of story. You need to buy some stocks here. Trump is literally giving away money. Don’t overthink it
631 2018-02-15 21:25:41 We'll never know. We do know, however, that AR-15's need to be banned. Along w/bump-stocks.  They should sue all of congress for not performing their duties to protect the citizens of the U.S. Yes.
632 2018-02-15 21:25:39 My class and I just bought half a million dollars worth of stocks with real money, now we’re all going to happy hour, I love my school lmao
633 2018-02-15 21:25:32 If MJ stocks go down because of a month delay, i'll be buying big!
634 2018-02-15 21:25:29 Stocks to trade hands down 
635 2018-02-15 21:25:21 Nope! Not with that capability. Not without greater purchasing power. Universal BKGD checks. Data bases Nationally combined. No mags clips greater than 8-10. No bump stocks. Better access to Mental Health. Trump overturned the bill that would stop severe mentally ill getting guns
636 2018-02-15 21:25:19 BS every move that Obama made to have guns registered, restrict guns to mentally ill people, ban large clips, or even outlaw bump stocks, it’s all been rejected by Republicans. The blood is on the Republicans hands not Obama.
637 2018-02-15 21:25:16 Well, what do you consider to be rapid fire? If you are referring to using a bump stock, there really is not much difference between the rates of fire at all. In fact, bump stocks yield innacurate shot groups, etc.

643 2018-02-15 21:24:40 You can take very simple steps to get it started. Ban bum stocks, stricter background checks, ban assault weapons. Just some simple steps that can be taken. People talk about mental health in this situation every time, but it’s not just a mental health issue.
644 2018-02-15 21:24:38 I have been doing so much research on stocks it's like I feel like I know what I'm doing. But I'm broke. 
Someone give me money to invest.
645 2018-02-15 21:24:29 Consider also investing in healthcare and pharmaceutical stocks since they'll be needed after all the firearms, alcohol, and tobacco.
646 2018-02-15 21:24:16 I’m embarrassed  our senators are putting politics and donors before children’s lives. Do they have a heart??Do we really need a weapon that has grooves in the barrel so that the round can do maximum damage to flesh. 15-20 round magazines?  Bump stocks?Sen. the problem, not guns!
647 2018-02-15 21:23:58 By law your executives should be arrested for selling stock with knowledge of a breach knowing stocks would tumble and you need to be shut the fuck down for your shitty shitty consumer practices. But seriously how do go to work everyday knowing you fucked millions of Americans?
648 2018-02-15 21:23:56 @marcorubio Would background checks make things worse, would banning automatic rifles make it worse, would eliminating high capacity magazines and bump stocks make it worse. This is not happening in any other country. DO SOMETHING IT WILL NOT MAKE IT WORSE.
649 2018-02-15 21:23:46 Congress included bump stocks in an over arching bill,  but nothing on its own
650 2018-02-15 21:23:43 Fannie/Freddie Need Your Money Again; Builders Optimistic; Rates Shun Stocks; How Bad Could it Get?
651 2018-02-15 21:23:39 @SenMajLdr some concrete actions u can take besides telling others to CARRY HOME PRAYERS.  Ban bump stocks, assault weapons, raise buy age to 21.  Don't allow mentally ill, domestic violence terror watch list ppl to buy.  Get rid of huge capacity magazines. Restart CDC research.
652 2018-02-15 21:23:33 Yes like calling our Senators and congressmen telling them we're going to vote them out if they don't do something about military-style weapons and bump stocks and so on! Enough children are in coffins this year alone to warrant some kind of change in the laws protecting guns!
653 2018-02-15 21:23:31 Llsss Ima teach yu shit that’s better than stocks! #Forex
654 2018-02-15 21:23:06 NO action was ever taken on bump stocks after Las Vegas. They rely on us forgetting and becoming numb to the shootings. They rely on us feeling powerless. The are in the pocket of the NRA. We MUST show them they are wrong. VOTE them OUT. Clean up our government. #GunReformNow
655 2018-02-15 21:23:04 Remember when they were talking about banning bump stocks, legislation so toothless that only the most desperate if liberal was willing to take it as a victory, and even the NRA said "fine you can have this ONE but nothing else" and it still didn't happen?
656 2018-02-15 21:23:03 Yes and that is why I've been open to changing legal age to buy a firearm to 21, I'm OK with fixing the background check issues and NICS required reporting.  I'm OK with talking about restrictions on bump stocks, and other things.
657 2018-02-15 21:22:48 You can take guns, but that won't solve mass killings.  You can take bump stocks, but that won't do it.  You can create more laws, but murderers will break them.  You can run a better background check, but so what?  You are chasing the wrong problem.
658 2018-02-15 21:22:47 As Senator Feinstein said:  When we do nothing, we become culpable.  We need to ban assault weapons, high capacity clips, bump stocks and trigger cranks.  We need to close the gun show loophole and restrict access to guns by the mentally ill.

#GunReformNow #GunControlNow
659 2018-02-15 21:22:46 @TheGreatBreon ayo  imma need you to start teaching me stocks and stuff becauseeeeee I’m tryna get on but I ain’t got time for all them classes 
660 2018-02-15 21:22:45 It's a combo of both being mentally ill and easy access. I don't think there needs to be an outright ban on the AR bc the vast majority of them will never be used in a crime, but they need to be significantly harder to get along with a universal high cap mag ban, ban bump stocks
661 2018-02-15 21:22:30 Well let's see universal law on background check, holding sellers accountable to complete, ie criminal charges for failure to complete process, eliminate gun show loophole, ban bump stocks, question accessibility of ar15 for civilians, reboot mental health exclusions, etc
662 2018-02-15 21:22:14 Quite a few interesting life science and provider pilots I work on and have seen, as well as lots of good ideas and startups - the problem is people started reacting to stocks thinking just being “blockchain” in health was a path to riches
663 2018-02-15 21:22:08 Common sense gun laws now...
1) No fly list = no buy list
2) 7 day wait on all purchases
3) Mental problems = no gun without physicians approval
4) Felons - Domestic abusers = no gun
5) Ban on assault/military style weapons and bump stocks.
664 2018-02-15 21:21:27 They don't have the votes for most measures outside of maybe bump stocks. Blake, D-Aberdeen, has a 100 percent rating with the NRA last time I checked and there are plenty of Democrats who are leery of gun control measures. Takko in the Senate.
665 2018-02-15 21:21:15 Zase fabulujete jako s bum stocks. Jasně, v Česku se po ulicích toulají tisíce lupičů s nožem či pistolí... Zkuste někdy kouknout na policejní stats. Hezký večer, musím také něco dělat.

671 2018-02-15 21:19:00 Guns are a problem, we need to restrict access based on background checks, we need to ban bump stocks, hopefully ban assault rifles, other things of a military nature. But we also need to talk about white nationalism.
672 2018-02-15 21:17:51 It’s because some special interest people in government want to secure positions in companies or stocks so they delay the process.
673 2018-02-15 21:17:42 Not yet. But they already are taking things related to guns.
Total involuntary confiscation of bump stocks here in MA, and it's coming to other states.
Personally, I don't care about the bump stocks themselves, it's the confiscation of private property that concerns me.

675 2018-02-15 21:17:26 There's no reason for a private citizen to have anything other than a handgun or a hunting rifle. BAN assault weapons, bump stocks, large magazines. CHILDREN ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN GUNS.

678 2018-02-15 21:16:41 Let’s see, the NRA opposes laws that would make number stocks illegal. The oppose longer waiting periods to get a gun and stricter background checks and limiting the size of magazines etc etc etc.
679 2018-02-15 21:16:26 Hmmmmm, I didn't read bump stocks or anyone can own any and every type of weapon they want. In fact the word "gun" isn't in their either.
680 2018-02-15 21:16:23 I believe the same, but I also believe we need sensible gun reform, & we can start by closing secondary loopholes at gun shows, enacting tighter background checks, & enforcing current gun laws. Also, ban A.R. 15‘s, AK-47s, & any other rapid firing weapons including bump stocks
681 2018-02-15 21:16:11 Buddy I get the silencers and bump stocks and other things you don’t need but to have hunting rifles and self defense guns isn’t s bad thing. How about instead of locking the killers up we just kill them and make an example.
682 2018-02-15 21:15:36 Okay, I’ll take background checks, ban on assault weapons, no bump stocks, limit magazine size, register guns. That would be a start. POTUS might also quit being a bully.

700 2018-02-15 21:10:25 These children are so right. We NEED better gun control. Normal, every day citizens shouldn’t be allowed to own machine guns or bump stocks. And we need to focus more on the mentally challenged. Make help more accessible to them, & make it harder for them to access and own guns.

702 2018-02-15 21:10:05 No, but watching your 620 charts as favored stocks pulled back provided lower-risk entries instead of chasing the upside gap at the open...still a crazy market.
703 2018-02-15 21:10:04 Made $73 yesterday on stocks, made $55 today
704 2018-02-15 21:09:46 Anything but ban AR-15’s, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, and require universal background checks and keep individuals on the terrorist no fly list from legally obtaining guns.
705 2018-02-15 21:09:45 My cholesterol
706 2018-02-15 21:08:58 Ban the 30 round clips.  Ban Bump Stocks.  Remove the immunity from lawsuits given to gun manufacturers in 2005 and signed by GW Bush.  Require guns to be registered (like a car) with annual fees used to pay for their carnage.  @realDonaldTrump @ChrisCuomo
707 2018-02-15 21:08:50 We ALL have the right to own guns. I want to keep that right. I also don't believe we should have AR-15s and mega mags, bump stocks. They are military grade weapons made to kill people used in war, they have no other use. If you have children..hold them close! 
708 2018-02-15 21:08:38 I would say it’s common sense that in a comprehensive reform bill, loopholes like that would be addressed. However, given the state of things, I can’t see it. Look at bump stocks and how the NRA pushes those, and how they had a bill to be banned that never got put to the floor.
709 2018-02-15 21:08:32 Until someone can offer a proposal that doesn't fold under the least bit of scrutiny I'll listen.

But if you aren't able to explain why pistol grips and collapsible stocks make guns magically more dangerous sit the fuck down
710 2018-02-15 21:08:10 do you know if this cover will be in stocks over US?
711 2018-02-15 21:08:03 more of a reason to regulate guns. close the gunshow loophole. limit clip sizes. ban bump stocks.
712 2018-02-15 21:07:59 Ok,and people KNEW about this kid yet no one reported him and when they did NOTHING was done. So again how does lack of police/FBI following up with the reports have anything to do with Trump? Obama approved bump stocks but I don’t hear bitching about that from LV shooting. SMDH!
713 2018-02-15 21:07:54 How about bump stocks?  Would you be willing to outlaw bump stocks?  Honest question..

718 2018-02-15 21:07:13 Remember 137 days ago when a single gunman killed 58 people and shot 851 others with a *legal* device called a bump stock that turns semi-automatic rifles into machine guns?

Bump stocks are still legal. We’ve lost our minds over guns in America.
719 2018-02-15 21:07:07 And they appear to have twitter accounts and are replying to me!  sure. NRA and Trump stopped legislation on mental folks buying guns. But hey, gun stocks are up! That's gotta make you happy!

Bump stocks exists because they're hunks of plastic that are easy to make but are basically useless. Agreed. Everyone that uses the term "gun culture" is clueless about them

737 2018-02-15 21:03:53 You do know that the NRA opposed legislation banning bump stocks? They tried to argue that the ATF should handle with tougher “rules.”  Nothing has happened

740 2018-02-15 21:03:44 Last year 1.5 million AR-15s were sold. We don't have 1.5 million Soldiers in our Army. I thought congress would ban bump stocks after Las Vegas, nothing.

You have to look like the other half too. Don't just pick the successful side
743 2018-02-15 21:03:14 1) gov is immune from suits of this nature 2) taxing guns/bullets for vests would require a law to be passed that does that... and tbh I see banning bump stocks happening before taxing guns & bullets at a high enough rate to buy $400 vests for every public school child/worker

747 2018-02-15 21:02:32 If the market goes up again tomorrow andt ons of Canadian stocks are again in hit the bid mode, I'm liable to lose it. :)
748 2018-02-15 21:02:28 For crying out loud, our fearful leaders - most of whom are DEEP in the pockets of the National Rifle Association () - haven’t even banned bump stocks yet! How hard a decision could that possibly be?! Grow some nads, you wimps! And stop selling out to the NRA! Ban bump stocks!
749 2018-02-15 21:02:26 Yes but the max a hand gun with a normal clip is what? 7-14 bullets compared to the 45 bullets from semi automatic rifle. I forgot in which shooting this happened but someone turned a semi auto to a full auto cuz of bump stocks a few weeks back.
750 2018-02-15 21:02:22 , the only stocks scene I did so far .
751 2018-02-15 21:02:17 Agreed.  I'm not anti gun. Used to shoot skeet and prone rifle as a kid. But the notion you would have even those guns at home would have been unthinkable, let alone the notion that semi automatic rifles and bump stocks would be pretty much universally available.
752 2018-02-15 21:02:11 Looking in from outside, it's impossible to understand why gun laws aren't proposed, or why trump removed a law that stopped the actually mentally ill from getting guns.  Or why bump stocks were ever allowed and why they haven't been banned...I don't understand gun culture.
753 2018-02-15 21:02:11 @AandGShow You guys asked about the bump stock ban; the ATF decided on two separate occasions that bump stocks were a legel form of modification. Which is why pro 2A advocates were reticent in passing a law or bill regarding bump stocks. (1/2)

757 2018-02-15 21:01:52 Lol true story. My husband and I are on opposite sides  politically. So I hear all the stereo types about conservatives and it drives me nuts. Most folks are practical people who are for basic gun control. Keep your guns but an AR 15, bump stocks? Nope.
758 2018-02-15 21:01:42 Donald Trump you need to do the right thing and in force gun control laws. That doesn't mean take all the Gun's away from people. Just band bump stocks and 60 round banana clips. Please do the right thing
759 2018-02-15 21:01:20 @SenMarkey @SenWarren @RepKClark @maura_healey @CharlieBakerMA After the Las Vegas massacre, MA lead the way by banning bump stocks. I expect my state to now put in place a system 4 ERPO (Extreme Risk Protection Orders) that could have prevented Parkland shooter from getting guns
760 2018-02-15 21:01:20 There's a whole lot of problems happening and if anything impacts sales for the gun lobby, nothing will happen. Bump stocks are no longer a federal issue, states are dealing with them. NRA also donated $31.2M to Trump which is why he never mentioned guns in his speech.
761 2018-02-15 21:01:18 The students at Parkland are demanding #GunControlNow listen to them!Assault weapons are used in these domestic terrorism incidents!

763 2018-02-15 21:01:01 That's absurd. GOP won't even allow a vote on most gun control measures. There's an assault weapons ban ready to go. What happened to banning bump stocks?  I respect you, but this is disingenuous.
764 2018-02-15 21:00:55 Very similar weapon that was used in FL, but he had a bump stock. Which is an additional tool added to the gun that makes it shoot similar, but not exactly the same speed as a fully automatic. I’m. It for a ban on bump stocks, but they should be in the category of fully auto guns
765 2018-02-15 21:00:54 I think we should tighten up the process of purchasing a gun like psychological analysis before purchasing but banning a gun based on its capabilities is even more stupid... these should be illegal to the wrong people and they should make bump stocks illegal to purchase
766 2018-02-15 21:00:53 It's amazing how Bear guests have compelling reasons why the Market will go DOWN and Bulls have compelling reasons why stocks should rise???  N O I S E! @FoxBusiness @cvpayne @LizClaman
767 2018-02-15 21:00:29 Way to go Senator! Push that bill through ban assault rifles and bump stocks now, today do it. #gunreformnow #guncontrol
768 2018-02-15 21:00:22 I don’t have specifics because any effort to even push things like background checks are killed.  Has congress moved on bump stocks?
769 2018-02-15 21:00:03 There is of course the voting history of certain lawmakers to take into account. Such as some of the recent OPPOSITION to banning bump stocks, the things that were supposed to be dealt with after Las Vegas.
770 2018-02-15 21:00:02 We've voted on repealing campus carry, it failed. We have a bill in committee to ban bump stocks, the chairman refuses to hear it. There is a bill in committee to punish those who abandon a firearm, no hearing. We will continue to pursue common sense safety measures regardless...
771 2018-02-15 20:59:37 Okay, you want an Idea.  Vote with everyone to do what Massachusetts did: Outlaw ARs -period. MA passed legislation outlawing bump stocks/ARs - since that time stats went from 128/yr to 2.  get that? 2.  VOTE for people who will BANN them state to state. Stop the Wild West

807 2018-02-15 20:50:50 Seems to me that AR-15s, bump stocks, etc are pretty low hanging fruit when it comes to gun safety.  Things like unarming street cops are much more radical in the public imagination.
808 2018-02-15 20:50:38 stocks back in order 
809 2018-02-15 20:50:06 This is a culture and mental health problem. You already have an incredible # of guns in circulation. There’s no going back from that. Like it or not the right to own a gun is constitutionally protected. There are common sense reforms like banning bump stocks but end of the day
810 2018-02-15 20:49:46 no glocks only glockenspiels

811 2018-02-15 20:49:33 This sounds very much like what you said about bump stocks after Las Vegas.  And that went nowhere.
812 2018-02-15 20:49:26 At least 17 people dead yesterday because Congress refuses to do anything about the gun epidemic.  They can't even get it together to do something as simple as ban bump stocks which allowed a mad man to kill 58 in Las Vegas. #GunReformNow

Will these prevent future shootings? No. But, it will have an impact. And it sure as hell is better than a simple shrug of our collective shoulders. 2/2
819 2018-02-15 20:48:51 I love how many people call the AR an "assault rifle, its in the name" while mentioning bump stocks, something they never heard of before vegas.
820 2018-02-15 20:48:50 "Actually maybe I'll just read this very long article on fish stocks in the Baltic before I check my emails"
821 2018-02-15 20:48:38 All auto and semi-auto weapons need to be banned outright. No reason any average citizen needs either unless it's to go on a mass murdering spree. Bump stocks also need to be banned and yes, I know, a gunperson can rig one up anyway, but they still need to be banned.
822 2018-02-15 20:48:32 Oh sure that's when they banned bumpfire stocks in Mass there was NO compensation for the turning in of that piece of plastic. Your wrong.
823 2018-02-15 20:48:25 I did this for my investment portfolio as well. Also removed all US military, insurance and energy stocks, along with removing all companies with dubious human rights records. It’s quite freeing. And my portfolio is rocking it!
824 2018-02-15 20:47:58 "Facts & data"?
Facts are that semi automatic rifles have been used in many mass murders.
Data is that hundreds of innocent people have died and 18 school shootings occurred in 2018 already. 
Ban all semi automatics & bump stocks TODAY mister Ryan. 
Or are you waiting for NRA $$?
825 2018-02-15 20:47:41 Ban assault rifles and bump stocks now #gunreformnow #guncontrol do it

833 2018-02-15 20:45:42 It’s helped absolutely.  Most of if not all of the most tragic shootings last few years were due to semi- auto.  Except for Vegas but he used bump stocks which also need to be outlawed .
834 2018-02-15 20:45:39 Months have gone by since the Las Vegas killings, and our nation has done  nothing to advance common-sense solutions, including regulating the  “bump stocks” that allowed the murderer  to cause hundreds of casualties. Common sense public officials understand that responsible-

839 2018-02-15 20:44:50 What kind of a despicable coward uses grieving families as “human shields” to deflect a conversation she just doesn’t want to have? Has it been long enough to to discuss bump-stocks? If you really cared about these families and others, you’d have tried to prevent these tragedies
840 2018-02-15 20:44:45 What is going on with the stocks??? Why we dropping so much???
841 2018-02-15 20:44:22 Good point. We are past the point of "let's take all the guns". Can't do it. Won't happen. Bump stocks and 30 round clips maybe. So we need metal detectors and we need 3-5 weapons in the school on trained people. It's the only solution now, all others are political banter....
842 2018-02-15 20:44:19 Keep bayo,bring customs again for fun idk about lylat, keep two stocks
843 2018-02-15 20:44:14 I own a handgun for protection (I don't have children & I keep it locked up). I see absolutely no reason anyone should have a machine gun, assault rifle or bump stocks. The only gun owners i know that want those weapons are mentally unstable.
844 2018-02-15 20:44:06 All I'm gonna say is that the gun store was packkkkkkedddd today. Gun stocks are on the rise again
845 2018-02-15 20:43:41 It’s not black and white; either or; it’s making it harder for violent people to get guns and about banning guns like the AR-15!!!  Hell, we can’t even get bump stocks banned and they are made to specifically kill as many as possible!!
846 2018-02-15 20:43:36 Sometime there is too many stocks to keep track off, however I do think strong SP movement for $taw next 12 months  ill have to shake the piggy bank see whats left to invest
847 2018-02-15 20:43:01 I agree that parents need to be more involved. Gun laws.  Why does anyone need an assault type weapon with high capacity magazines? Certainly not for hunting. Same thing with Bump stocks. These are not defensive weapons. Most of my friends are responsible gun owners and most
848 2018-02-15 20:43:00 I agree! So many traders twit about non-trading stuff. And so many don't share what stocks they trade. Madaz is the best, for sure!
849 2018-02-15 20:42:17 Common Sense: Inflation and Stocks Are Both Up, and That’s Stirring Some Worries
850 2018-02-15 20:41:54 I’m reading investing in stocks for dummies. I would suggest starting there.
851 2018-02-15 20:41:37 Yep and every single time you guys say exactly the same thing. Every. Single. Time. ("don't talk about it now, too sensitive". "Thoughts and prayers".) Remember those bump stocks that were going to be banned?
852 2018-02-15 20:41:20 Banning of assault rifles and "bump stocks". Background checks and delays before purchase. Open carry and concealed carry laws. Restrictions on ammunition purchases.
853 2018-02-15 20:41:16 @CNBCClosingBell @RickSantelli : Stocks did not just hit hyperinflationary territory. it worked it's way there. Bond yields are doing that!!
854 2018-02-15 20:40:59 Military style weapons are banned and so are high capacity mags as well unless you have the clearance for them as far as bump stocks go they arent easy to get nor are they used a lot in mass shootings. Universal baclground checks already exsist. And your last point is correct.
855 2018-02-15 20:40:50 I am long in $BMY.. bought at $54.. selling today and locking down my profit !!
856 2018-02-15 20:40:45 Banning full auto, bump stocks, drum mags, all fine, but we need to be able to protect ourselves from a potential tyrannical government. That's the whole point of the second amendment. If you want to live in a dystopian commie wet dream, I'm sure you can find a place.
857 2018-02-15 20:40:29 Hello @RepSamGraves it is long past time to support criminal background checks for all guns sales/transfers, close domestic violence loophole, ban bump stocks, #stopCCR and proliferation of silencers. NOW. @MomsDemand
858 2018-02-15 20:40:28 I’m ok with handguns, shotguns and some rifles. No useful purpose for AR’s and bump stocks. None.
859 2018-02-15 20:40:21 So tell me then, how would a national firearms registry prevent a mass shooting? Or a ballistics registry? Or tracking ammunition sales? Or banning bump stocks?
860 2018-02-15 20:40:02 I get it man.  I'm probably 25-75 in favor of AR15 variants (no need for em, but...).  Bump stocks I don't get.  Extended mags I don't think make a big difference.  And the gunshow loophole, yes, close.  Background checks on all purchases, I agree.  We need to find common ground.
861 2018-02-15 20:39:48 Folks on both sides of the aisle HAVE BEEN grieving..... some months, some years because it just keeps happening. 3 mass shootings in last year. When’s the time to talk about ANYTHING related to this issue? Mental health? Bump stocks? Background checks?
862 2018-02-15 20:39:45 So tell me in your fantasy world just what restrictions are needed THAT WILL ACTUALLY PREVENT these tragedies?  Bump stocks, agree!   But other than that, handguns are just as powerful as any rifle (assuming school scenario or nightclub or theater or church).
863 2018-02-15 20:39:25 Dear Congress, A bunch of us are tired of waiting for Congress to act.  So we will be showing up at all local and state govt meetings to demand they act.  Will vote you out and vote in those who will.  No AK15s.  No bump stocks.  Universal licenses. #WereComing #NoAK15s
864 2018-02-15 20:39:16 Canadian oil and gas stocks had a rough few years and the December lows came with good volume but the jan lows had less volume but worse sentiment reaction to news.  Wrist behind us and many have been priced well below realistic valuations. Future news less neg = pos reaction
865 2018-02-15 20:38:59 Pray all you want. It won't do anything without also doing something. We need universal background checks and to close the gun show and personal sale loopholes. We need to ban bump stocks and assault weapons. This is nuts.
866 2018-02-15 20:38:44 Constitution does not include gun swaps, semi-automatic weapons, or bump stocks.

873 2018-02-15 20:35:53 ARM our Teachers by VOTING against the NRA on 11-6-2018! A VOTE for a REPUBLICAN is a VOTE for more horrible attacks on our schools! 
AR-15 military weapons & Bump Stocks need to be OUTLAWED! NOW! RIGHT NOW!
874 2018-02-15 20:35:21 Maybe this is too middle-of-the-road, but:

Ban bump stocks.
Limit Mag capacities.
Expand background checks.
Take mental health more seriously.
875 2018-02-15 20:35:20 Not everything, I could agree on banning bump stocks. Technically none of the guns being used in these attacks are Assault Rifles. Guns have to be fully automatic (not semi-auto) to be an Assault Rifle. Many people seem to think AR15 stands for Assault Rifle rather than Armalite.
876 2018-02-15 20:35:08 @CNBCClosingBell @KellyEvansCNBC : it's official: short volatility has been weaned out of the market. Stocks are back in hyperinflatio &...
877 2018-02-15 20:34:48 Just keep saying that.  Should keep your shill from NRA coming in.  Here's the thing.  A bunch of us are tired of waiting for Congress to act.  So we will be showing up at all local and state govt meetings to demand they act.  No AK15s.  No bump stocks.  Universal licenses.
878 2018-02-15 20:34:13 Prayers are not enough.  Sensible gun reform laws need to be implemented asap.  For example, how about a ban on bump stocks, or closing the gun show loophole, or limiting the number of rounds in a clip, or ban semi-automatic or automatic rifles.  Don't JUST pray; DO SOMETHING.

882 2018-02-15 20:33:39 @GOP DISGUSTING @NRA We dont need assault rifles and bump stocks for public consumption! #accessorytomurder #yourtimeisup
883 2018-02-15 20:33:36 The ar-15 was never banned. All the law did was limit military style features, you know, things that do nothing to make the gun more lethal, like fore grips, telescope stocks, they did nothing to make gun anything but more pleasing to the eye of liberal nuts.
884 2018-02-15 20:33:15 Yet, avid hunters and NRA fans say they need rapid fire bump stocks or AR's or AK's to hunt. If not, they want them to kill people. As many as they can in the shortest time possible. Why?
885 2018-02-15 20:33:09 Ok Joe; All your laws are passed, all the AR15s, Ak47 and like weapons are destroyed. Everyone goes thru a background check, no fly no buy is passed, and bump stocks are gone. What will stop a unchallenged person with a lever action from shooing 50 students?
886 2018-02-15 20:32:34 Bump stocks are still available since Vegas. And do us all a favor and stop pretending you care
887 2018-02-15 20:32:13 I hope every member of the committee who defeated the ban on bump stocks in Virginia knows that we are watching and we will be campaigning against them!
888 2018-02-15 20:32:10 Obama signed a new law that blocked the sale of guns to mentally ill people, as well as the restriction on the sale of bump stocks. Both have been reversed by Trump. BTW, how people keep deflecting to Obama is ridiculous.
889 2018-02-15 20:32:01 How about we just ban AR-15's?  And maybe bump-stocks. Then stricter background checks. That's a good start.  The mental health issue is going nowhere because no one knows what they can do about it.
890 2018-02-15 20:31:57 Markets are so quite. Big bets on VIX spike again, buy stocks in TV, 10Y=2.90%, "Dollar is collapsing" theme, tons of buy-the-dipers again laughing after they've been wiped out on $svxy. My nose is telling me something big will strike in a matter of few days... #patience
891 2018-02-15 20:31:38 Will you are an aggressive far right male, but once more only. There were no automatic, semi- automatic weapons & no bump stocks when the 2nd Amendment was written. Now I’m done with this discussion.
892 2018-02-15 20:31:37 exactly. And there is no reason (IMO) that anyone needs a AR. Congress couldn't even ban bump stocks after 600+ shot in Vegas

898 2018-02-15 20:30:51 @MedvedSHOW 2a advocates are open to discussing solutions, absolutely. We were open to discussing bump stocks after Las Vegas. Remember what happened after that? They started demanding we ALSO legislate magazines, silencers, and "chainsaw bayonets"
899 2018-02-15 20:30:48 Gun control doesn’t mean taking away everyone’s guns. It means common sense measures, like banning bump stocks.
900 2018-02-15 20:30:20 here's a thought: swap bump stocks for suppressors on NFA. Obvious benefit on both ends.

Gun owners would go for it. Left wouldn't, because they can't abide any de-ratchet at all.
901 2018-02-15 20:30:15 They convert them to bullets and bump stocks
902 2018-02-15 20:29:51 It seems that every time a child dies from a gun shot wound in this country the @NRA gets their wings in the form of cash fucking money because gun stocks rise. F*#k you @NRA @gop you too. We are voting you OUT. And may your time in hell be endless.
903 2018-02-15 20:29:49 Magazine specifics, stock specifics. These make no substantial difference. Background checks have a high potential to make a difference. The only things worth banning bump stocks and other accessories in that category
904 2018-02-15 20:29:42 imagine there would be an online sales tax, imagine they are about to cut the „FANGs“ into a few pieces > good or bad for INDU, NDX and SPX??? ...let‘s prepare for another sell-off?!...opinions?! #fxdirk #markets #trading #stocks #indices
905 2018-02-15 20:29:40 You forgot to mention that gun manufacturers stocks RISE during the event.  Horrific.
906 2018-02-15 20:29:36 Except he won’t do anything. @realDonaldTrump and @GOP are beholden to @NRA Just like bump stocks, this will go nowhere. Need to vote Republicans out to make a dent. #StopGunViolenceNOW
907 2018-02-15 20:29:35 The NRA is even support of bump stocks. This was an under the radar item that had never been used until this one time.
908 2018-02-15 20:29:32 We can certainly ban the means to kill dozens of people in minutes, which is our current situation with assault rifles circulating freely and the more pernicious bump stocks. There is no value to these weapons in hunting or target practice.  Their only utility is mass slaughter.
909 2018-02-15 20:29:18 Trump misses the point completely!  We must have better background checks, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, and close gun show loopholes!  A teenage girl from the school asked why they cannot but alcohol but can buy an assault weapon!
910 2018-02-15 20:28:58 Full disclosure, yes with a but. Bump stocks are stupid. I've always thought they should have been banned. Semi auto? No. Hollow points? eh... I don't know. They have their purpose.. the really nasty stuff got banned years ago.
911 2018-02-15 20:28:38 how do couples invest in stocks via the companies directly or do you have to have a broker to buy stocks? #FinishRich #wbchat

914 2018-02-15 20:27:45 There has not been a conversation about Las Vegas. “Let the ATF review bump stocks.” Congress punts. Don’t talk about good faith. When an immigrant kills, the political agenda is immediate. Otherwise it’s “too soon”, after a school shooting, to talk about it.
915 2018-02-15 20:27:25 Fair enough. Do you see a role for any restrictions on what can be purchased? Bump stocks, semi-automatic, hollow points?
916 2018-02-15 20:27:24 there is absolutely no reason that anyone should be able to purchase weapons that let them kill hundreds of people per min. assault rifles & devices (ie bump stocks) should be banned & better checks+mag limits. how many schoolchildren have to be murdered before our gov realizes?
917 2018-02-15 20:27:20 - mandatory universal background checks
- increased wait times per every x firearms purchased
- federalize more gun regulations
- national firearm registry
- ban bump stocks
- lifetime bans on firearm sales to anyone with history of domestic abuse
- more funding for mental health

919 2018-02-15 20:27:04 The reality of it is my friends like @jimcramer said, we never should have been down that much to begin with. Buy stocks, plenty of upside this year based on strong earnings amd guidance being reported
920 2018-02-15 20:27:02 to be clear: Vegas' shooter had 18 AR-10 / AR-15 weapons modified with "bump stocks" that could move 9 rounds a second through.
921 2018-02-15 20:26:50 Isn't this the same thing he said after Vegas? After the TX church shooting? During that discussion he was "open" to about banning bump stocks, which never actually happened?
922 2018-02-15 20:26:37 Half mast flags will not prevent another.  Look to other countries to see what works.  Be the big man that you claim and get comprehensive gun control.  You cannot even buck the NRA to get bump stocks banned; no hunter, gun enthusiast, or the need for protection requires them.
923 2018-02-15 20:26:28 My mom made me pick stocks then put $50k in them. I was like uhhhh why would u do that she goes "I felt good". She just made like $5k in a day, why does this woman know everything
924 2018-02-15 20:26:11 @TomiLahren Regarding #GunLaws Would you have the courage say the same thing to the victim's families? NO ONE except for military/law enforcement needs assault rifles or bump stocks. How many DEAD Americans do you need to see to prove this? #LasVegas #Pulse #Columbine
925 2018-02-15 20:25:48 We’ve been trying to have a conversation, but @realDonaldTrump and @GOP keep saying that it’s not the right time to talk about trying to lessen gun violence. After two recent mass shootings in FL, now is time to ban semiautomatic rifles, large magazines, bump stocks etc.
926 2018-02-15 20:25:44 so that means we have to find other solutions
what about banning bump stocks?
what about making it illegal for people on terror watch list to purchase firearm?
what about banning high mag ammo for private citizens?
927 2018-02-15 20:25:35 We want more than a proclamation.  We want laws.  No AR-15's.  No bump stocks. No gun show loopholes. More mental health funding.
928 2018-02-15 20:25:12 This is prob why that's so tricky to trade cryptos. 
You have ton monitor constantly BTC when trading alts. 
Being a daily crypto trader is not easier than trading stocks or Forex.
929 2018-02-15 20:25:03 So every time a bipartisan deal comes along, you bash it and point to a republican only created bill.   What happened to you claiming to work together?  Guessing you’ll get to bump stocks right after?
930 2018-02-15 20:24:58 Bump stocks you can take or leave I don't care. What is considered a high capacity mag. I have 30 Rd clips for all of my rifles. I'm an NRA
931 2018-02-15 20:24:57 Lol stocks...they have no utility and are completely manipulated.  Why are they on this list?
932 2018-02-15 20:24:09 i believe in the 2nd amendment but I’m all for banning semi automatic weapons and anything like bump stocks.

937 2018-02-15 20:23:27 I don't accept that. . .it will never go away completely, but we can reduce the risk. As of now, congress is literally doing nothing. Bump stocks after Vegas? Nothing. A few days, nothing will change. Its disgraceful.
938 2018-02-15 20:23:17 But w gat will Trump and the GOP congress do to protect the students? 
Suppose the AK-15, AK-47, bump stocks had been banned years ago. Would that have helped protect the students? Not a trick question.
939 2018-02-15 20:23:11 Boycott Fox propaganda sell stocks boycott products
940 2018-02-15 20:22:41 How many men women and children is it worth to keep AR-15's, bump stocks, and mentally ill people with access to guns because the @NRA lobby and bribe politicians to fulfil corporate profit?

1000?
100,000?
100,000,000?

What's the death threshold? @GOP
941 2018-02-15 20:22:23 1. Mandatory Universal background check.
2. Minimum 72hr waiting period 
3. Ban assault rifles, bump stocks
4. MANDATORY LIABILITY INSURANCE -Separate premium for each weapon
5. NRA $ out of politics ( all corporate $, really...)
942 2018-02-15 20:22:20 We need owners of AR style weapons to speak out against high capacity magazines, bump stocks and online purchases of large amounts ammunition. The truly enlightened would remove these guns from their homes or destroy them themselves. ARs are made for mass destruction.
943 2018-02-15 20:22:15 Occasionally I witness a word crime and wonder if @MerriamWebster has a jail or stocks
944 2018-02-15 20:22:13 Disagree. Especially, when it comes to accessories such as bump-stocks.
945 2018-02-15 20:22:11 There are other guns that shoot the same ammo and have the same magazine capacity that have wooden stocks. Would you consider them in the same propaganda?  @NewtownAction.
946 2018-02-15 20:21:57 Honor them with universal background check, outlawing semi-automatics, outlaw bump stocks, limit magazine size.

949 2018-02-15 20:21:11 Gun control doesn't mean take everyone's guns.  It meansmaking it harder to get a gun than it is to get a driver's license.  It means preventing AR 15s with bump stocks from being sold legally.
950 2018-02-15 20:21:10 Seems worth it to do this for some stocks.  Then sell short side on the dips.
951 2018-02-15 20:21:06 Good Eggs must disappear. Poof. Athletes do GREAT with beating ZEEEEEEE RO. Most banks pay well. I'm Private. No Stocks or Shares. We have BIG BONUSES & GLOBAL Profit Sharing.
952 2018-02-15 20:21:05 Yes compounding interest is huge, nice example! Also getting in really early on investments whether stocks, real estate, crypto, etc.
953 2018-02-15 20:21:00 of course, slowly pull out money from my stocks and put in crypto. Teach my grandkids about crypto and give them the private key/ledgers.
954 2018-02-15 20:20:48 I am 110% for banning bump fire stocks and it was dumb that the ATF approved them for sale (the reason they were approved is the ATF's definition of machine guns defines them as more than one shot per trigger pull and the stock technically doesn't do that.)
955 2018-02-15 20:20:45 I haven’t heard if the FL shooter had a bump stock to make his AR automatic (continuous fire while keeping trigger pulled — illegal). Bump stocks were used by Vegas shooter — & not a fucking thing done despite @GOP BSing they support ban on bump stocks.
956 2018-02-15 20:20:41 the fact that it says bump stocks are an issue shows how little they actually researched.
957 2018-02-15 20:20:38 Grabbed some at 4.93, good entry
958 2018-02-15 20:20:36 $INPX could squeeze over $3  Shorting these stocks with just few shares of float is very risky
959 2018-02-15 20:20:11 Obama approved Bump stocks on 2 occasions. Why?????  Who needs those. Where the hell was the F.B.I.? Interviewed the kid who reported him but not this kid who made the threat?
960 2018-02-15 20:19:46 It’s true, I have just started my journey in stocks, just a month, long way to go
961 2018-02-15 20:19:24 Nothing I said was opinion. It's a fact that AR-15s were still being sold from 94-04. Only difference being they didn't have telescoping stocks, bayonet lugs or flash suppressors--cosmetic features.
962 2018-02-15 20:19:08 I’m tryna save my money and buy stocks this year. Ya know, make money while I’m sleep 
963 2018-02-15 20:19:02 You mean a military-styled rifle which is functionally-identical to a common hunting rifle? Even things like bump stocks, which increase the rate of fire, harm the accuracy enough to be less-deadly than a normal semi-automatic gun in the hands of a trained shooter.
964 2018-02-15 20:18:42 i don’t care if we can’t get the whole wall down in my lifetime as long as we start chipping away. incrementally creating new normals, no bump stocks, no assault rifles, no stockpiling, full irrevocable ban for convicted domestic abusers would go a long way to change the culture
965 2018-02-15 20:18:41 $MBRX spiking again into the close. Wanna see if gonna have a morning spike tomorrow.

#stocks #market #stockmarket #daytrading
966 2018-02-15 20:18:23 I agree with bump-stocks and background checks. Assault weapons is too broad of a term. Semi-automatics will never be banned.
967 2018-02-15 20:18:22 Maybe teachers need to wear bullet-proof vests and helmets. Better to bar assault rifles. But alas, impossible to even restrict bumper stocks here in weird America!
968 2018-02-15 20:18:18 If you really like the activist/potential take out stocks take a look at $type.  Starboard isn't wrong on that one....uncanny how my research seems to line up...
969 2018-02-15 20:17:51 The don't take action on this issue because they will lose money. Remember after Las Vegas they said they would ban bump stocks. The ban never came. I think Massachusetts is the only state that banned them.
970 2018-02-15 20:17:46 Thanks Mark, please let me know if any stocks can be pre buy.

972 2018-02-15 20:17:14 Gun show purchases work exactly as the law details in states that do not require private sellers to perform background checks. No loophole. Better background checks how? How can you determine what a person will do before it happens? Bump stocks are a one off exception....
973 2018-02-15 20:16:56 Bump stocks and all gun laws are already state regulated laws so he didn’t do shit, our state did
974 2018-02-15 20:16:55 Blaming trump for this shooting is JUST FINE but simply pointing out that Obama legalized bump stocks is terrible. Got it.
975 2018-02-15 20:16:14 their stocks dropped like crazy, the new updated pulled them back up a bit though, but they're still a lot lower than ever other year before
976 2018-02-15 20:16:03 not sure I"m normally up early at 5 a.m. every morning looking at what stocks are up, and doing my research on why they are up, and seeing what kind of company it is, there is a lot that go into it. I've only been trading for about 2 years so I'm fairly new as well
977 2018-02-15 20:15:35 wish everyday felt this good

Already loving Twitter for what’s its providing me...fun
980 2018-02-15 20:15:05 Probably the one who said waay back in Octocber 2017 about bump stocks:
"I wasn’t familiar with them until this came up. So we’re looking at that and studying the issue,"
Maybe ask him how that study is coming along?

983 2018-02-15 20:14:40 "These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law."
984 2018-02-15 20:14:36 Not speaking about the gun industry  is censorship on talk radio. Local industry but common sense things like bump stocks or background checks
985 2018-02-15 20:14:31 Reading is tough, huh bubba?

"We indeed found two occasions in which ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it *could not regulate* bump stocks during the Obama administration."
986 2018-02-15 20:13:54 Them lil stocks i invested in booming rn
987 2018-02-15 20:13:50 Except as I wrote abt in FFTT last week & as we saw, US tax receipts & US consumption now HIGHLY correlated to US stocks.  Ie any crisis that lasts longer than a few wks will quickly force the Fed to helicopter money to avoid US nominal defaults.  Another reason USD lks sick IMO
988 2018-02-15 20:13:41 There should be a national database that tracks all weapons, ammunition & accessories like bump stocks. All guns should also be insured. We should also put the background check in there as well. If this was in place, it could have stopped the shooter in Las Vegas.
989 2018-02-15 20:13:41 Mag caps. Tax. Bump stocks illegal. Either safety classes or check-in with local law enforcement quarterly or whatever.
990 2018-02-15 20:13:01 I don't necessarily agree with another assault weapons ban, but I wouldn't be up in arms about one either. 

- expanded/universal background checks
- harsher penalties for any firearm related violations
- mandatory waiting period
- bump stocks should have been gone years ago, etc
991 2018-02-15 20:12:52 Hedge funds are cluelessly chasing #stocks again as if we were at the beginning of a business cycle. #Trumpville #BigFatUglyBubble #MAGA

993 2018-02-15 20:12:46 I have never understood how the question of gun control is even a question.  Bumper stocks, semi-automatic, and fully automatic weapons should NEVER be used outside of our military and highly skilled law enforcement.  If you don't trust our military or police UR the problem.
994 2018-02-15 20:12:42 About stock traders that didnt share any knowledge: its one of the main reasons why people are leaving the stockmarket bigtime for crypto. Its likely that stocks will dissapear within. 5-10 years from now, the current system is too greedy to survive.
995 2018-02-15 20:12:39 @MarkHerringVA wants universal background checks closing "gun show loophole" ban on bump stocks converting semi-auto weapons into fully auto and military assault style weapons ban. VA gun laws much weaker than DC, MD @wusa9
996 2018-02-15 20:12:35 Obama is and was the best gun sales man for the last 8 years gun stocks went through the roof for gun  makers. So don’t believe what he says

1005 2018-02-15 20:11:10 For me, I want the onus of gun control, the monetary cost, to go hit the rich assholes who put the latest guns in video games to sell them to teens, who use mass shootings as advertising. The fuckers who make bump stocks and 40 shot magazines.

1011 2018-02-15 20:09:30 Who approved Bump stocks on 2 diff occasions? That was Obama. Hillary took money from Forbes. U have no idea what you are talking about. You should just go get pissed on again. See that u love that.

1013 2018-02-15 20:09:09 This kind of domestic gun violence only happens in the Good Ole USA folks The NRA is directly aiding and abetting domestic terrorists - It is time to regain control of the NRA - NO assault weapons - NO bump stocks - NO unlimited magazine clips
1014 2018-02-15 20:08:55 How about bump stocks? do you need a bump stock to shoot a deer? Maybe a dinodeer.

1017 2018-02-15 20:08:01 Your words are exactly the words that the President and the GOP used after at least the last mass school shooting. Bump stocks, nothing done, a rollback of the mentally ill being able to own guns, no movement on background checks and now students, teachers and parents asking why?
1018 2018-02-15 20:07:38 Banning the AR-15, Bump Stocks and high capacity magazines is a good starting point.

1020 2018-02-15 20:06:27 We need to refuse to vote for any candidate who isn’t LOUD AND PROUD for common sense gun reform. Increased background checks, ban on assault rifles, required child safety, ban bump stocks, no fly/no buy lists.
1021 2018-02-15 20:06:04 Bump stocks are legal, ppl on no-fly list can buy assault weapons. You & congressional leaders are spineless NRA puppets.
1022 2018-02-15 20:05:47 Define "assault weapon" please. High capacity magazines have no impact on the amount of people shot in any of these shootings. Almost all mags found in Orlando, etc had less than 10 rounds fired. Bump stocks were 1 issue, but the same can be performed by holding the stock 1/4"

1025 2018-02-15 20:04:58 Background checks are a start but we HAVE to ban assault weapons, bump stocks and anything designed for war. We need to STOP allowing the NRA to run our country. #EnoughIsEnough

1034 2018-02-15 20:03:05 Seeking bans on "bump stocks" is insufficient. Military grade weapons have no place in a home, in hunters' hands or especially in the hands of children. Neither do 10+ round magazines or clips.

1045 2018-02-15 19:59:00 I'm all for a ban on bump stocks, but I don't think we can do that and then consider the problem solved.

1056 2018-02-15 19:57:34 Universal background checks. Increased funding and access for mental health in general and in public schools, ban on assault style weapons, limit clip size to 10 rounds, gun safety class, no bump stocks, no silencers. Check Canada's requirements those would do fine.
1057 2018-02-15 19:57:34 At the end of the day, guns should be banned from society.  Endless misery for people & critters.  G.O.P. can't even ban assault rifles & what happened to bump stocks?
1058 2018-02-15 19:57:16 Has the traitorous coward Paul Ryan collected all the information he needs on bump stocks?
1059 2018-02-15 19:56:31 Problem is you're not taking this holistically.  You not only make them unavailable for purchase, you ban them.  Bump stocks also.  When I first saw people at my shooting range with a semi automatic I was startled.  They were reckless people too.  It unnerved me.  Full circle.
1060 2018-02-15 19:56:12 @SenDonnelly As a Hoosier and a supporter of yours I urge you, I beg you, to take action to at least try to help stop these mass shootings. Ban bump stocks NOW. Work toward a ban on semi auto rifles and large capacity magazines. Doing nothing is costing children’s lives.

1065 2018-02-15 19:55:05 2 different stocks you posted. Which one is it?
1066 2018-02-15 19:54:27 You took the words out of my mouth. We stop sending our kids to school, stop going to work, stop buying shit we don't need until Congress passes sensible gun laws and bans automatic rifles and bump stocks ( at the least).

1067 2018-02-15 19:54:26 @BloombergRadio @markets @carolmassar : Alternative Investment does not include your traditional stocks & Bond. More synthetic!!!
1068 2018-02-15 19:54:18 I’m saying don’t make the guns we have on the market available. I don’t profess to be even remotely an expert in guns but Bump Stocks or military rifles! Why? Why are these necessary to sell to the public? They are the gun laws I’m talking about.

1070 2018-02-15 19:53:56 Bonsoir @Fnac , j'aurais juste une petite question. Y aura-t-il des stocks en magasin du Steelbook spécial FNAC de Thor Ragnarok ? Merci
1071 2018-02-15 19:53:53 First of all, I meant to post AR-2-15 and gun grabber is a delusion you're having. That's a fact the guns and the bump-stocks are a big part of mass shootings. They're is absolutely zero use for the public to  use except for mass shootings.
1072 2018-02-15 19:53:44 I hear they're very popular. Stocks are due to be Gone in 60 Seconds.
1073 2018-02-15 19:53:31 Again, let’s get a national database that tracks guns like cars. Guns should be insured like a car. We should track ammunition & accessories like bump stocks. Had we had this the guy from Las Vegas would have been caught before he did what he did & killed so many people.
1074 2018-02-15 19:53:17 #VoteThemOut2018   Ban assault weapons! Ban bump stocks!  Ban high capacity clips.
1075 2018-02-15 19:53:17 Yep, I looked at gun stocks, didn't budge, it means smart money thinks nothing will change.  And they're right.  Not a single bought and paid for Republican in the Trump swamp will do more than tweet "thoughts and prayers".
1076 2018-02-15 19:53:14 Stocks take the stairs up, the elevator down, and the ramp back up.
1077 2018-02-15 19:52:45 Yea you right and they did end up banning bump stocks but im definitely not saying ban guns lol, i just don’t think high capacity high fire rate fire arms are necessary straight up, i would feel safe with a gun i could conceal in my palm
1078 2018-02-15 19:52:43 sorry, just realized I was wrong! It's not gun ownership but STOCK (market) most stocks 86% are owned by 10% of America
1079 2018-02-15 19:52:39 No such things as "AssaultGuns" and bump stocks can be 3D printed so they will never go away. Assault is an action not a object
1080 2018-02-15 19:52:28 Make AR-15's and their kind illegal. Magazines? Illegal. Bullets for these weapons? Illegal.  Bump stocks? Illegal. Possessing one? Punishable by a massive fine and significant jail time! Establish a task force whose sole job is removing them from circulation. Done. Easy.
1081 2018-02-15 19:52:00 Do you also agree that certain types of guns/stocks should be restricted? Or just the people who can own them?
1082 2018-02-15 19:51:59 So most NRA members, which seems to be a terrorist supporting organization, support domestic terrorism like this?

They support semi automatic weapons being legal, and bump stocks being legal?

1085 2018-02-15 19:51:26 Why don't we start by taking semi-auto firearms off the street and out of stores. Mega magazines? Gone. Bump Stocks? Gone. Now we might have a chance of taking down a shooter intent on doing harm.
1086 2018-02-15 19:51:21 Another boring day where stocks are just going up by little or down 
1087 2018-02-15 19:51:09 I am so sick and tired of idiots like you trying to school me about weapondry, GO FUCK YOURSELF! We need sensible gun reform and we can start by banning assault rifles and bump stocks. END OF STORY CATHERINE
1088 2018-02-15 19:51:00 He can talk about whatever he wants.  He can't write and pass legislation banning AR-15s, or bump stocks, or any of that.  I'm sure Obama would have signed those bills into law, if he'd had the opportunity.  Trump would veto them.
1089 2018-02-15 19:50:45 Even with support of @NRA to ban bump stocks, @SpeakerRyan couldn’t even take it up and instead deferred to ATF.

1091 2018-02-15 19:49:59 @realDonaldTrump So what should we do? Ban Assault rifles bump stocks high quanity magazines? Nah! Let's build a wall and have parade
1092 2018-02-15 19:49:56 The filibuster is only in the Senate, and a bump stock ban would not be filibustered by Dems.
Regardless, we've seen Rs pass legislation through both houses that they actually care about. They don't care about bump stocks.
1093 2018-02-15 19:49:45 So your solution is to ban scary-looking rifles? How about just making the stocks pink? Does it bother you that the last 'assault weapons ban' had zero effect on crime or are you just into posturing?
1094 2018-02-15 19:49:34 Yes - we will do anything to protect you, except pass a single law on assault weapons, back ground checks, bump-stocks ... nothing shooting after shooting...all of gutless Congress, both parties, you be ashamed, as should you Donny, for not being a true leader on this issue .

1097 2018-02-15 19:49:18 In a market crash everyone is positively short gold.  its gonna rip higher and take all your stocks called away...gold futures go sky high in next session.  just a few covered calls the market is going rip from portfolios 
1098 2018-02-15 19:48:37 they try to justify extension of the deal to the second half of the year. their "forward guidance" was initially absurd. the irony is that they need growth in US stocks next months to justify extension linked to the old rule (5Y averages of OECD stocks)
1099 2018-02-15 19:48:28 we need MORE Guns, More bump stocks, I want to buy thousands of rounds of Ammo, Smoke grenades and gas masks. I want to carry guns on my hips just like Cowboy Days so I can challenge anyone on the streets! trump needs more CONTRIBUTIONS/Money from you guys, the NRA! SHOOTEM UP!!
1100 2018-02-15 19:48:17 It would be so easy for the GOP to at least PRETEND like they care. Pass universal background checks and get rid of bump stocks. Common sense right? Not for them. #GunReformNow
1101 2018-02-15 19:48:04 21 and up for AR, no bump stocks, no silencers. 1 month waiting period/heavy background before AR is obtained.
1102 2018-02-15 19:47:48 Why Didn't Everyone Buy Stocks in 1980 like #Buffett? The 70's were a Brutal #BearMarket That Went NO Where for 10 Years & #FED Put %Rates at 18%! #msnbc #foxnews #wapo #wsj #cnbc #npr #nytimes #cnn #cbs #politico #slate #drudge #huffpost #congress #gop #401k #nyt #bbc #ecb
1103 2018-02-15 19:47:40 NOW is the time to address gun control. Ending bump stocks, implementing 3 day waiting period, etc.
1104 2018-02-15 19:47:18 Totally fine with global market portfolio, though don't like market cap weighting.  But also limiting to just stocks for no reason is sub-optimal IMO.
1105 2018-02-15 19:46:47 Banning assault weapons, assault weapon ammo, and bump stocks would be more meaningful.
1106 2018-02-15 19:46:42 Well said! How about no assault weapons and no bumps stocks and maybe gun owners should be required to carry insurance on the fire arm like I have to with my car
1107 2018-02-15 19:46:19 Let me know if you have fun getting rage/no rage 0- death by bayo and have to fight an advantage bayo while on ur last stock.

1108 2018-02-15 19:46:17 #NRA screw the facts assault rifles and bump stocks are only for killing people. #gunreformnow #guncontrol #pissonthesecondamendment
1109 2018-02-15 19:46:14 Great tip. I would recommend bonds and money markets over stocks as a more secure savings investment
1110 2018-02-15 19:45:46 "bump stocks, the device that allowed the shooter's semi-automatic rifles to mimic the rapid fire of machine guns."  "Bump stocks are devices that allow a semi-automatic gun to fire more like an automatic weapon" No, you're right though.
1111 2018-02-15 19:45:44 What about using something like $ACWI or $VT and leave the "tilting" for their own overlays of single-stocks or low-cost ETFs?
1112 2018-02-15 19:45:27 People with guns kill people. People with assault weapons with bump stocks kill many, many people.
1113 2018-02-15 19:45:24 also no reason to ignore every other asset class? bonds, real estate, farmland..

US stocks only minor portion of global market portfolio...foolish to arbitrarily focus on just one asset...my $0.02.
1114 2018-02-15 19:45:15 Here’s a start- close loopholes at gun shows, real background checks, stop sale of assault weapons and bump stocks to civilians and bring back the initiative Trump threw out last year that made it harder for mentally ill people to obtain weapons.  A start!
1115 2018-02-15 19:45:13 The Republican majority won't even deny gun ownership to those on the no fly list. Republicans won't ban bump stocks  A Republican president allowed the ban on assault weapons to expire. The Republicans passed legislation to ban gun violence studies. Anyone see a trend here ?
1116 2018-02-15 19:45:03 You are a disgrace. You can do something RIGHT NOW by bringing a vote to: expand background checks; to outlaw military weapons; to outlaw bump stocks, to name a few. Yet @SpeakerRyan ? YOU DO NOTHING.

1122 2018-02-15 19:43:24 so many reasons here.... 45 investable countries in the world.  why pick just 1? (see history of stocks in Germany, Russia, China, Argentina, Japan, etc in 20th C). 

can you imagine alums when US stocks decline 50-80% as they have in the past?
1123 2018-02-15 19:43:20 If I understand the table correctly, there are currently less than 50% of S&P component stocks above their 50dma, so 80% showed positive returns after 20 days, with average gain of 2.1%
1124 2018-02-15 19:43:08 Piss on the 2nd amendment. Ban assault rifles and bump stocks #gunreformnow
1125 2018-02-15 19:43:06 Backround checks are a different issue. So are bump stocks. My issue was, you called an ar-15 an "automatuc" weapon, and asked why does someone "need" one.
1126 2018-02-15 19:43:03 The @NRA is too busy trying to get bump stocks and any rate increasing device banned to care about anything else. #NotReallyActivists
1127 2018-02-15 19:43:03 What’s up?

1130 2018-02-15 19:42:23 Thoughts and prayers are not enough. Background checks are not enough. Closing gun show loopholes are not enough. They will help but anything less than a ban on assault riffles, extended round clips, and bump stocks is totally unacceptable.
1131 2018-02-15 19:42:22 Ok let me specific even though the A.R. 15 is the rifle of choice for mass shootings. We need to ban all semi-automatic, rapid firing assault weapons now, not tomorrow, now. And BUMP STOCKS TOO

1133 2018-02-15 19:42:06 Without action to prevent further atrocities your thoughts and prayers mean nothing #gunreformnow please.  Ban bump stocks and assault rifles today
1134 2018-02-15 19:42:00 I assume you think of "hunting rifles" as those with brown wood stocks and "killing machines" as the matte black "AR"-type. Maybe you don't. But both come in semi-automatic models and can fire deadly rounds at the same rate. And both are often used to hunt woodland critters.
1135 2018-02-15 19:41:43 Bump stocks are still legal, thanks for playing.
1136 2018-02-15 19:41:22 Bump stocks are also illegal
1137 2018-02-15 19:41:02 Ban bump stocks? 
Nope, sorry.
1138 2018-02-15 19:40:58 Bigger comeback factor and play better since you have 2 stocks left rather than ur last stock for the game.
1139 2018-02-15 19:40:53 Then those should be illegal, too. The AR-15 would be a good start. Bump stocks would be a good start. 

Do you have an actual point?
1140 2018-02-15 19:40:52 Remember when the GOP blocked a ban on preventing those on the no fly list from buying guns? Remember when the President rescinded the rule that prevented those with mental health issues from buying guns? Remember when Congress failed even to ban bump stocks after Las Vegas?
1141 2018-02-15 19:40:35 Ok, semi-automatic weapons that can be made to work like automatic weapons with bump stocks and other manipulations. There are 300 MILLION guns in the USA. There are 30,000+ deaths by gun in the US a year, how can you possible say UK has worse stats than that?
1142 2018-02-15 19:40:33 @LindseyGrahamSC Against bump stocks but for AR15? This 19 yr old was able to buy a AR15 to mow down the 17 dead and 14 injured people yesterday, but isn't old enough to buy a handgun! Maybe if you had children you would think differently, but that's doubtful! #GOPSameShitOnGuns

1152 2018-02-15 19:37:53 There is no hope with this GOP Congress. They wouldn't even ban bump stocks which would be a good first of many steps to addressing gun violence. We just need 2 in the Senate and 24 in the house. 3 people, I'd donate today to are @PhilBredesen @kyrstensinema @RosenforNevada.
1153 2018-02-15 19:37:49 or at least bump stocks. Thats ridiculous. There has to be some compromise here.
1154 2018-02-15 19:37:38 I am surprised someone hasn't done a study on the mechanics of banning at least one type of weapon or even those bump stocks.  It sure feels like there have been studies done of just about every other topic imaginable.
1155 2018-02-15 19:37:37 Idea is to use it with broad asset classes (i.e., US stocks, foreign developed, EM, US REITS, Intl REITS, a couple of bond categories).  Not sure how to handle expected lower returns of the bonds. Maybe add a 3% adjustment to bonds (LT average underperformance vs stocks)...
1156 2018-02-15 19:37:22 Not as stupid as allowing military style weapons and bump stocks on the streets of a " civilized society." Not as stupid as allowing @NRA or other large organization to buy off our so called leaders. We the people? Ha, sure
1157 2018-02-15 19:36:49 They’re quick to wipe away people.  Do they also scan for references to combat weapons, bump stocks etc.?
1158 2018-02-15 19:36:44 And bump stocks
1159 2018-02-15 19:36:41 Chased it on the way down during the correction and got it in high 150s. All because you said you can get great stocks cheap during your coverage! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
1160 2018-02-15 19:36:35 So again I ask-what’s the point of making AR-15’s available to everyone? What’s the point of bump stocks?
1161 2018-02-15 19:36:31 Curious as to the penalty for the #bonkban. Censure? Castration?Firing? Jail? Fine? Death? Stocks on Parliament Lawn? Hmm.
1162 2018-02-15 19:36:18 I think many/most gun owners are in favor of the common sense stuff (magazine capacity limits, universal background checks, banning of things like bump stocks), there's just nobody who speaks for us. Lobbying happens on the extremes on both sides.

1164 2018-02-15 19:35:51 Guns should not be outlawed. It should be extremely hard to get them. It should be more difficult to purchase massive amounts of ammo. Excessively large magazines should not be legal. Bump stocks should not be legal.
1165 2018-02-15 19:35:46 Reminders of Dad all of the time. I know stocks of @SharisBerries  went down. He would send it to all his “cutie pies” his girls on days like Valentine’s Day. I just cry everytime I see their ad. Bobby Bo was the best to us. Miss him like crazy heartbroken. love you dad!
1166 2018-02-15 19:35:46 Check my tweets. Basically, a new and improved Assault Weapons Ban. Other things like universal background checks. Make sure national database works. Include people who have protective orders against them. But get rid of AR types, bump stocks, large round magazines.
1167 2018-02-15 19:35:42 It’s BOTH gun laws and mental health! Why are AR-15s, bump stocks and other weapons or devices capable of committing horrific destruction even on the market-??

1172 2018-02-15 19:34:01 Nice words, POTUS.
How about also doing something that stops this carnage instead of just saying nice things? What happened to the ban of bump stocks after Las Vegas?

1180 2018-02-15 19:32:33 Another assault weapon. Another attack by someone with a large magazine clip. Another attack by a person with mental illness. Republicans can’t even discuss bump stocks after Vegas. Unforgettable!
1181 2018-02-15 19:32:30 The fact that no restrictions on bump stocks could not pass after Las Vegas shooting demonstrates that NRA maniacs run Congress policy on guns despite fact that large majorities favor restrictions. Only hope is midterms turnaround in Congressional representation.

1184 2018-02-15 19:31:26 Senator you wouldn’t even vote to ban bump stocks after Las Vegas. You’re not a serious person on this issue. Please get out of the way and allow people who actually want to prevent these kinds of tragedies do the necessary work ahead.
1185 2018-02-15 19:31:20 ....that’s all very well but are there sufficient safeguards in place to preserve the best of Manx heritage?

Thinking here especially of the stocks, the workhouse and the beautiful neo-gothic bingo hall that is the envy of all from here to Onchan
1186 2018-02-15 19:31:05 I could see the emotion in your voice as I saw your reporting on CNBC just now,from Dubai. Why is there reluctance for Congress to ban bump stocks ?
1187 2018-02-15 19:30:52 my god, the vacuousness of this post is remarkable. extended background checks, restricting bump stocks, restricting magazines etc aren't empty; what's empty are the hearts of the NRA and its bought-and-paid-for politicians

1189 2018-02-15 19:30:02 How do you explain DT reversing Obama's directive stopping mentally ill from owning guns?
We don't have universal background checks.
We don't have a Federal Gun Registry, ban on bump-stocks, assault-weapons ban, limit on high-count magazines.
Thank the NRA, GOP for that.
1190 2018-02-15 19:29:41 Oh yeah baby  If Europe jacks up futures tonight, dont be mad america, we move markets when you cant react. the markets can exaggerate stocks overnight, but if Everything never closed, you all lied to God and earned you extradition to your home countries.  Government is simple.
1191 2018-02-15 19:29:20 Extensive background checks are run by the fbi already. If you purchase a certain amount of guns within a certain amount of time they will decline the sale. They are already passing legislation on bump stocks. Criminals don’t follow laws. So none of that matters anyway.
1192 2018-02-15 19:29:12 I don’t like assault weapons bans, but banning bump stocks shouldn’t be a partisan issue. They’re not accurate enough for legit use. Only use is the novelty of experiencing auto fire, and shooting indiscriminately into a crowd. Or am I missing something?
1193 2018-02-15 19:29:00 Stocks are headed for another beautiful day.
1194 2018-02-15 19:29:00 Ganfeng's timing is excellent.  Lithium stocks are very cheap.  On my point- since Ganfeng owns 17% of ILC.V ($14M mkt cap) and Ganfeng is spending $17M this year alone.  Why not buy out International Lithium outright?
1195 2018-02-15 19:28:53 Ooh! Is it? My turn... um.. poppy candy chocolate crispies! Local Morrisons frequently stocks them but hasn't recently. I miss them.
1196 2018-02-15 19:28:34 Lets talk about how easy it is to purchace combat style weapons altered slightly for sales to civilians and then let's discuss BUMP STOCKS all in the same conversation. Way to easy to convert into to military grade weaponry!
1197 2018-02-15 19:28:27 The NRA does not write our laws and I'm pretty sure legislation is being passed against bump stocks.
1198 2018-02-15 19:28:24 After mass shootings both the sales of guns/ammunition & the stocks jump up. Money is always being made off of misery
1199 2018-02-15 19:28:04 UVOL-DVOL shows up volume vs down volume, so thats not stocks that's value
1200 2018-02-15 19:27:57 I do and would love a chance to go on a shopping spree.  Interesting that stocks like MCD, HD, and UPS haven’t participated as much as others in the snap back rally
1201 2018-02-15 19:27:54 If going there, look at some of the XLE stocks. XOM in particular is at a huge discount
1202 2018-02-15 19:27:41 #stocks Ever look at the portfolios of America's super rich?  It's very revealing. You can replicate them by simply buying the entire DOW 30 with all dividends invested in additional shares. Holdings include few small or intermediate high tech companies. History matters.
1203 2018-02-15 19:27:17 Fuck bump stocks.  Fuck AR47s.  Fuck guns.  Fuck NRA campaign cash.
1204 2018-02-15 19:27:03 The jigs up NRA - we tried to do things your way - and as you can see it isn't working. NO bump stocks - NO assault weapons of mass carnage - NO unlimited magazine clips. What's sold is out there - BUT NO MORE
1205 2018-02-15 19:26:57 I will try.

There are simply limited stocks of fish, migrant or not.
Even non-migrant fish do move about, but slower

1206 2018-02-15 19:26:54 US stocks brush aside inflation fears. Warren says not a worry
1207 2018-02-15 19:26:51 @marcorubio How many NEW AR-15's a sold every year? So every year you wait MORE are on the streets according to your logic!  So let's mitigate the damage then! And band all 'bump stocks' too! You can do something but @NRA told you. #liar #BloodOnYourHands
1208 2018-02-15 19:26:34 Individual stocks don't matter that much. All about asset allocation and building an Excellent portfolio
1209 2018-02-15 19:25:59 Just checked my stocks and your boy may be retired at 34 if everything fluctuates as planned!!! 
1210 2018-02-15 19:25:50 U & R's in Congress r pure evil as well. Bought & paid for by NRA. U want to stop these events, then ban AR-15, universal background checks, ban bump stocks & armor piercing bullets. That is how us stop these shootings. States w/tough laws have fewer gun incidents. Proven fact.
1211 2018-02-15 19:25:41 You being against bump stocks makes no difference to policy until you are willing to vote for the candidate who promises to ban gun stocks. Same thing with background checks etc. Everyone is for it but no one will “vote” for it.
1212 2018-02-15 19:25:40 Nice buys still coming in 20k at ask
1213 2018-02-15 19:25:19 .. What makes me laugh about the state of the stock market is that CNBC sells stocks all day long to retail and then, when the market crashed, blamed all the money that had flowed in in January, effectively calling it out as dumb money
1214 2018-02-15 19:25:16 Cuts to SNAP will mean loss in sales, hurting corporations in the grocery business such as Wal-Mart. Look to see stocks get dumped if this goes through.
1215 2018-02-15 19:24:48 banning the base weapon. If you wanna say the base weapon isn't technically "assault" because it isn't technically semi-auto, that's fine. Then we'll expand the ban.

No one should own the base weapon. This ain't just about bump stocks and high cap mags.
1216 2018-02-15 19:24:48 @JMVala_Trades Hey man how do you interpret $UVOL and $DVOL? On my platform its showing 252.62 $UVOL and 168.34 $DVOL. My take is that theres 84 more stocks on the rise?
1217 2018-02-15 19:24:43 Mr. Fortenberry, when I wrote to you about bump stocks your response was that you wrote a letter to the ATF and they responded that they did not have to power to regulate them. I hope that you are currently working on legislation for this and other common sense gun regulations.
1218 2018-02-15 19:24:26 Now I agree bump stocks, non traceable rounds should not be used and banned... which the NRA has put forth to get rid of this.   Just know the populous will not stand for gun banning. Won’t happen and shouldn’t
1219 2018-02-15 19:24:07 That’s all I have to say. This conversation shall be repeated after the next mass shooting and I will buy gun manufacturer stocks as that is a predictable trade at this point.
1220 2018-02-15 19:23:33 Have I argued that nothing should be done to change yesterday? All I've said is that an "Assault Rifle ban" wouldn't change anything because it wasn't an Assault Rifle.

I'm fully supportive of legislation to ban bump stocks and limit mag capacity. What else would've helped?
1221 2018-02-15 19:23:24 Too many in Congress are owned and indebted to the NRA instead of being focused on we, the people.  

Hey, GOP, wake up & disassociate yourselves from the NRA.

Hey, Dems, grow a pair, be stronger, fight until you ban assault weapons, bump stocks.  Stand up against the NRA.
1222 2018-02-15 19:23:22 Nick I love the beeb ( no adverts and publicly owned ) but please let’s hear views from all ... I don’t need stocks and shares only on the today programme I need to hear the 99% news as well
1223 2018-02-15 19:22:41 Budweiser stocks immediately rise after this news
1224 2018-02-15 19:22:25 Thank you so much!!
1225 2018-02-15 19:22:17 Nothing wrong in his statement. @GOP couldn't even ban bump stocks after Vegas, their mouths are so attached to the @NRA's teat. $>lives. It's disgusting.
1226 2018-02-15 19:22:04 Automatics are nearly impossible to buy/own. 

Semi-automatic just means when you pull the trigger one bullet is fired. Do you want all semi-autos banned?

Bump stocks are a feature added to a rifle. I’m fine with banning them. They are a novelty item.
1227 2018-02-15 19:21:55 I want to invest in stocks somebody help me!
1228 2018-02-15 19:21:50 I am just glad republicans waited the appropriate amount of time after Vegas and then banned bump stocks........
1229 2018-02-15 19:21:43 I say ban, ar-15's and assault rifles(to the general public). Bump stocks and extended mags aswell..  Handguns, shotguns, and hunting rifles seems fair enough for people to stay safe. But harder for people to buy assault rifles
1230 2018-02-15 19:21:39 BAN HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES.
BAN THE AR-15.
BAN BUMP STOCKS.

This is not a hard or intractable problem to solve. 
JUST FUCKING DO IT, CONGRESS.
1231 2018-02-15 19:21:35 Much difference between an assault-style military and a 6-shooter.  Assault-style weapons should be banned, not regular guns, rifles and shotguns.  Oh and ban the bump stocks.
1232 2018-02-15 19:21:20 Ils ont les ressources pret de chez eux car ils c'est les seul a avoir le métier, et le seul truck qui pourrais porter a se pauser la question de ou est l'or c'est leur absente dans les stocks
1233 2018-02-15 19:21:19 Reinstate Obama’s policy making it harder for mentally ill people to get their hands on guns. Ban assault rifles and bumb stocks. No one needs those things to hunt deer or defend themselves from the government. Make any person who wants to own a gun take a class
1234 2018-02-15 19:21:07 bump stocks! All of this could have been avoided if we banned bump stocks!
1235 2018-02-15 19:21:00 I mean I get what you’re saying people apparently have their uses for guns but an AR-15 and things like bump stocks are unnecessary for an everyday civilian
1236 2018-02-15 19:20:57 Start with banning AR-15s, bump stocks and massive magazines. That doesn't violate the constitution. And if the NRA thinks it does, let them spend their $ fighting the ban in courts instead of buying puppets like @marcorubio to choke common-sense legislation.
1237 2018-02-15 19:20:32 Don't worry.  the republicans promised they were going to ban bump stocks after Vegas...........
1238 2018-02-15 19:20:09 Exactly. It IS an issue of mental illness & guns. Both AR15 & bump stocks r legal. However, mental illness was an evaluation Trump recently did away w/towards purchasing firearms & their accessories. No one’s looking 2 take away any sane enthusiasts guns or their right 2 own.
1239 2018-02-15 19:20:04 I agree that guns are guns at some level - but an AR-15 is statistically the gun of choice for mass shootings for a reason - easy to modify (bump stocks, full auto) and designed for high rate of fire. It is the M-16 and its inventor says it should be regulated more!
1240 2018-02-15 19:19:30 Yep the good ol’ bump stocks
1241 2018-02-15 19:19:14 Anyone have a program or code to pull stock metrics into an excel file? Similar to Gurufocus but not $400 a year?  #Investing #investments #investors #stockmarket #stocks
1242 2018-02-15 19:19:03 @LindseyGrahamSC  Please explain why assault rifles should be legal. Bump stocks are chicken feed. And you’re chicken to ban only those.
1243 2018-02-15 19:18:47 I need to buy more stocks. What are some pretty lucrative ones at the moment?
1244 2018-02-15 19:18:27 If you want to salami slice exactly what can or cannot be banned, or you wanna say "ban bump stocks but not my precious base AR15" or whatever I'm gonna cut your Gordian knot and just say "ban them all."

Not playing that game.
1245 2018-02-15 19:17:53 Regardless, its been confirmed he used one. Bump stocks may not be good enough for you, but clearly they were for the mass murderer enabled by the AR-15.

1274 2018-02-15 19:17:32 These assualt grade weapons and bump stocks should and will be outlawed. That shouldn't effect you that much...just buy more legal weapons and ammunition
1275 2018-02-15 19:17:08 Add to your list of banning/limiting of AR's and bump stocks. No one needs either of those items for hunting or personal protection.

It's a step in the right direction to publicly commit to changes.  Now let us see you take the actions.
1276 2018-02-15 19:16:47 No bayo ban, no customs, keep lylat, 3 stocks
1277 2018-02-15 19:16:42 Most if not all were bought legally. And the government knew he had them. The bump stocks were bought legally as well.
1278 2018-02-15 19:16:02 I am educated in this. I don’t see the point in bump stocks. But to blame the NRA is foolish in my opinion. I believe a person is responsible for their own actions. Let’s blame fire departments for the California fire while we are at it.
1279 2018-02-15 19:15:37 Both sides agreed we should ban bump stocks last year

One side proceeded to actively prevent bump stock being legislation from being brought to the floor

What value is there in finding ways to partially blame dems?

Just provides cover 4 republican inaction

1281 2018-02-15 19:15:07 An our laws hand cuffed a ton of available opportunities to sound the alarm.  A 19 year old buys an assault weapon legally, really!  Nothing done about bump stocks after Vegas, nothing after Sandy Hook or Orlando.  The body count continues.  #EnoughIsEnough
1282 2018-02-15 19:14:49 I can tell you don't know much about guns. Bump stocks should be illegal but hardly ever used, also you can easily get a magazine for a handgun that holds 20-30 rds. Plus what's a reload time? 1-2 seconds? stop wasting time on these arguments.
1283 2018-02-15 19:14:33 @realDonaldTrump promises to tackle issues of mental health re mass shootings. Anyone else feeling that it’s a great time to buy prison REIT stocks? #FloridaSchoolShooting #GunControlNow

1285 2018-02-15 19:14:08 While @senmarcorubio may be right, why not make it harder to obtain that gun?  Control assault weapon sales, toughen registration laws, crack down on gun show sales, ban bump stocks.  Do something to make it harder for these people to get a weapon.
1286 2018-02-15 19:14:07 Thank you!
1287 2018-02-15 19:14:06 Still kind of missing the point Romy. Cho Seung-Hui killed 33 at Va. Tech w/ a .22 caliber and  Glock 9 mm pistols. Basic hand guns. So called Assault rifles are not the problem unless they are motified illegally or w/ bump stocks. Bump stocks should be banned along w/ 30+ clips
1288 2018-02-15 19:14:05 they do nothing.  Even after Vegas, they pretended to be on board banning bump stocks...a minor, sensible gun control measure, but then once the interest in that attack subsided (as it always does) they quietly killed it (pun intended).
Blood of these kids is on all their hands
1289 2018-02-15 19:13:35 While that’s true in this scenario it would have had zero affect on the Vegas shooter.   ARs, bump stocks, high capacity mags should all be banned nationwide (imo).
1290 2018-02-15 19:13:02 I have used them as well and in competitions. It's foolish of you to go around spouting an AR15 is not an assault weapon just for technical semantics. That is the same mentality that allows bump stocks to exist. Please take your own advice and get some education on this matter.

1292 2018-02-15 19:12:51 Here are 3: Ban bump stocks, increase the age needed to buy an AR, extensive background checks.
1293 2018-02-15 19:12:46 Require gun registration in every state. Require 21 years of age to purchase guns. Require background check on all purchasers. Ban bump stocks. 
That's a start.

1298 2018-02-15 19:11:13 Yeah well, what do you call bump stocks and crap like that? It’s a legal way to get around semi-auto. No, it’s not as efficient but a lot of laws can be tightened up.
1299 2018-02-15 19:11:07 As if you actually felt any empathy for anyone that’s gone though this. You only think about you. Your ilk would prefer everyone armed to the teeth and half the population dead. Does the GOP have controlling interest in funeral home stocks? Might explain why they love guns so.

1302 2018-02-15 19:10:02 ...and the next massacre with politicians doing nothing about it. The endless cycle continues. They didn’t even ban the bump stocks after Las Vegas... The anti gun-control way of things clearly is working out for us. 18 school shootings in 2018 so far. MURRRICA!
1303 2018-02-15 19:10:01 Stocks will be down 80% while TLT is up 30%. Not sure why you would want to be in equities. It is not just the Fed. Deflationary bust means corporate profits likely fall by 50%+. Treasuries will be in big demand everywhere. Not all about the Fed.

1306 2018-02-15 19:09:44 Drama queen mentions "bump stocks." Straight out of the Lib/Dems playbook. Also the crocodile tears. Like Obama crocodile tears.
1307 2018-02-15 19:09:27 Mid-Day Market has MBS up 20bps, while Yields hold at 2.89%.  Stocks continue to climb with DOW up over 200 and NASDAQ up to 90.
1308 2018-02-15 19:08:32 I agree bump stocks could be banned, but if you really wanted to, you could use your belt loop as a bump stock...
1309 2018-02-15 19:08:26 The reality is that this is a complex problem that doesn't have one sweeping solution.  I would love to see small but consistent, steps taken, for example; outlawing bump stocks, increasing research funding into the psychology of violent behavior, improving background checks.
1310 2018-02-15 19:08:14 I am a gun owner as well. Bump stocks should be banned. High capacity magazines banned. And if you are going to keep a assault rifle you need to have liability insurance and pass training.  I believe in the second amendment. Gun ownership needs to be well regulated.
1311 2018-02-15 19:07:10 Same stocks I use on the text lel
1312 2018-02-15 19:06:58 I won’t hold my breath.  The GOP policy platform enables stuff like this.  Pro gun, pro racism, pro toxic masculinity, and anti medical care. Why would I expect you’d change now?  Didn’t after Vegas. Couldn’t even get rid of bump stocks.
1313 2018-02-15 19:06:39 $CCIH covered at $1.48 for $120+ profit !! #stocks #Stockstowatch #StockMarket #PROFIT #DayTrading #Daytrader
1314 2018-02-15 19:06:34 Fuck thoughts & prayers. Ban assault rifles, make it as impossible as possible for anyone w/MI to EVER purchase a gun, ban bump stocks...get this shit done before we have to ensure these senseless massacres again. HOLD YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR FUCKS SAKE!
1315 2018-02-15 19:06:32 GOP CONGRESS IS THE REAL MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE-who think it’s okay to own military style assault weapons/high capacity magazines/bump-stocks-All made to murder large numbers of people quickly
They won’t close gunshow loophole 
or STOP those on NO FLY LIST from buying guns
BOTE BLUE
1316 2018-02-15 19:06:17 We have sub trays at work a lot, and some dude waits like 30 minutes and packs it all up to take home. He even takes the dishes of mustard and mayo. This guy also owns a summer house in Bermuda and talks about his stocks to anyone who will listen. Jerk.
1317 2018-02-15 19:06:05 Citizens can take action, Hedge Fund managers can take action by disinvestment in publicly held gun manufacturers. Check your IRA's, your investment funds and be sure none of them hold stocks in gun manufacturers. #GunReformNow
1318 2018-02-15 19:05:54 Why do some stocks have such a wide spread?
1319 2018-02-15 19:05:44 @Swat_Notes man Chinese stocks just can't run AABA or MOMO
1320 2018-02-15 19:05:33 @LindseyGrahamSC 
U say you'll vote for banning bump stocks and increasing funding for mental health,but U won't vote for banning AR-15's, So we will vote you out! How's that? We will vote all you spineless, corrupt @NRA supporting republicans OUT!
#EnoughIsEnough
#GunControlNow
1321 2018-02-15 19:05:25 It’s a mental health problem not a gun problem!
Get real it’s lax gun laws and  an AR 15 problem congress stand up to the N.R.A.  What happened to banning Bump Stocks?  Same old republican B.S.
1322 2018-02-15 19:05:20 First it was bumper stocks, now its AR-15, don’t understand why would a civilized society need weapons left,right, centre as if we are tribal community fearing warfare and animal attacks, have they heard of something called the police  for protection? #GunReformNow
1323 2018-02-15 19:05:19 Oh stuff it Trump! Who needs your hollow words! Same damn speech each time a disaster . How about some damn common sense gun laws?! Hell you can’t even get rid of the bum stocks which caused all those deaths in Vegas. You, the NRA and Congress are all complicit in this disaster.
1324 2018-02-15 19:05:11 #FBI  Please be aware that bump stocks are often called "kits" for upgrade and can be purchased at pawn shops and gun shows
1325 2018-02-15 19:05:05 “Billionaire issues dire warning regarding stocks.”

How many times can you possibly recycle the same stupid headline?
1326 2018-02-15 19:04:57 BUT AR STANDS FOR ASSAULT RIFLE! BUMP STOCKS! SCARY GUN! HURRR DURRRR BAN IT BAN BAN WYH DO YOU NEED GUNS ANYWAY 1A IS BAD HURR DURR /s
1327 2018-02-15 19:04:52 14 day waiting periods
No sales by private owners
No sales at gun shows
10 rounds magazine limit
No bump stocks
No cranks

Minimum age of purchase at 21
Assault rifle ban

Domestic violence ban
There you go
1328 2018-02-15 19:04:23 @realDonaldTrump 

ADMIT YOU MADE THE FOLLOWING MISTAKES 

-Ending Obama's reg prohibiting the sale of guns to mentally ill
-Falsely claiming @TheDemocrats want to confiscate guns. Dems want Gun Safety Laws inc. ban on bump stocks & assault weapons
-Put NRA Donations before lives
1329 2018-02-15 19:04:22 Peep the gun stocks
1330 2018-02-15 19:04:18 Why can they only by big cap Stocks?
1331 2018-02-15 19:04:16 I think bump stocks and AR-15s/ other assault rifles should be banned. I think people with domestic violence issue s should be banned from getting guns, I think safety classes should be required with a gun purchase
1332 2018-02-15 19:04:09 My guess is that the founders would have amended the wording of the #2A if they imagined Americans mowing down innocent people with SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLES, BUMP STOCKS & HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES. Because they would have been appalled. #2A was never intended for that. #GunSenseNOW
1333 2018-02-15 19:03:37 No surprise that gun stocks are doing well. No surprise at all here
1334 2018-02-15 19:03:05 Lots of them, limits on firearm types and ammo, get rid of bump stocks and any other modification pieces, all states same background check procedures, to name a few. There’s a lot that can be done w/o taking away from responsible gun owners as myself.
1335 2018-02-15 19:02:44 Just shut up already. Your party does not want to make the investment necessary to do that. So stop it. AR's and assault rifles should be banned. High capacity magazines should be banned. Bump stocks too. Invest in mental health services.
1336 2018-02-15 19:02:35 No one is taking your guns away. But WTF does any civilian need an AR-15 assault rifle? Bump stocks? You clearly aren’t hunting deer with an assault rifle meant to mow down many people in your path within a matter of seconds! We’ve lost enough children to school shootings in 2mos
1337 2018-02-15 19:02:34 It's time we stop being afraid to stand up & tell our leaders that we've had enough. I'm a legal gun owner/carrier. I'm a proponent of the 2nd amend. But high cap mags, AR15's, AK47's, bump stocks, etc are all unnecessary. Only LEO's & military need access!! #GunControl
1338 2018-02-15 19:02:34 Wall Street Instant Update; 2pm #Stocks higher by 165 Dow points, Nasdaq +78, S&P up
1339 2018-02-15 19:02:25 The guns that are designed to maximize range and the number of targets are the ones that the shooter are have used. Besides the AR 15 is popular because it’s easily modified, by fixing bump stocks that’s what the Vegas shooter did
1340 2018-02-15 19:02:22 @BHHSRealEstate @SEC_Enforcement is there a case set up for this company that has taking advantage of their own size to pump stocks? For example today, why would they publish they added AAPL shares/?  That is rigged game.
1341 2018-02-15 19:01:31 I plea to anyone I know or who reads this, unless you are current military or law enforcement, or licensed private security with $250-500 per semi/automatic gun annual permit and insurance, please don't buy an AR-15 and no bump stocks.
1342 2018-02-15 19:01:17 Sure, thanks for asking. 

- Universal background checks
- Not allowing the mentally ill to purchase or own firearms
- A national firearm registry
- Tracking ammunition purchases
- Banning automatic weapons
- Banning bump stocks
- National FOID requirements
1343 2018-02-15 19:01:09 Can we please do something about sensible gun legislation before more kids get killed just going to school?  We need to do something NOW.  Way beyond time to ban bump stocks, AR-15's and large-capacity magazines.
1344 2018-02-15 19:01:03 How many of you still think its safe to Investment in PSU Banking stocks over Private Banking stocks becoz just the former is Govt undertaking? #KFA #PowerSector #Miningsector and now #NiravModi ..what does they all have common???..No need to answer it, just give it a thought!
1345 2018-02-15 19:01:00 Keep cashing those NRA checks, Slimeball!
1346 2018-02-15 19:00:58 Ok, Mr. Pedantic, allow me to clarify (altho I know you know what I meant).

BAN the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle

In fact, BAN ALL SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLES

BAN high-capacity magazines

BAN bump stocks

CLOSE the gun show loophole

Have I expressed myself clearly enough for you now?
1347 2018-02-15 19:00:29 No. It was semi-automatic rifles fitted with bump-stocks to make them automatic. Why does anyone NEED that kinda artillery?
1348 2018-02-15 19:00:24 If the whores in congress quit taking the NRA money, we can get some control on these AR-15 assault weapons and bump stocks.
1349 2018-02-15 18:59:56 Yes. They should. Bump stocks should be illegal bc automatic weapons are 99% illegal already. I’d also like to add anyone on the terrorist watch list as those who cannot buy a gun.
1350 2018-02-15 18:59:51 NRA stocks?
Are you confusing them with firearms manufacturers?
1351 2018-02-15 18:59:38 Yup that's what people didn't like about bump stocks, so they made the the SSAR-15 OGR
1352 2018-02-15 18:59:37 The NRA does a lot of good things like education etc but they do dumb things also like fight to keep pump stocks in ppl hands that’s just dumb
1353 2018-02-15 18:59:23 It won't have hurt to leave that Executive Order in place either! Every Obama effort on gun legislation was thwarted or met by subterfuge by Congress & what legislation that did come up after Obama including bump stocks after Vegas died in Congress.
1354 2018-02-15 18:59:00 Could have gotten rich. Should have bought a shitton of Nintendo stocks... Oh wait. I don't have money, cause I'm not allowed to hae money because of my government... Damn it. #NintendoLabo
1355 2018-02-15 18:58:50 This is the seal on the Republicans last stand for any opportunity to ever be elected again. You have done nothing to change this horrific killing in this country. You all should be ashamed. Remember bump stocks? Again nothing! Blood on your hands! Shameful
1356 2018-02-15 18:58:41 Ideas to prevent school shootings:

Pass assault weapon ban

Ban bump stocks

Ban high capacity (over 10) ammo clips

Pass universal background checks

Make mental health mandatory reporting, tie in to background checks

Fund enhancements to school security nationwide
1357 2018-02-15 18:58:30 Ammo stocks on the rise
1358 2018-02-15 18:58:15 It’s different when it’s “us”!
1359 2018-02-15 18:57:19 UK Market Close: Stocks shrug off another strong US inflation print
1360 2018-02-15 18:57:12 Making the sale of devices that make semi autos act like autos (bump stocks, the rapid fire roto device for fingers which is banned by atf), and changing must issue to may issue to allow sheriffs more control who is licenced. /2
1361 2018-02-15 18:57:00 No Ban, prob no customs but worth testing the 1 per character, keep lylat, fine w. 2 stocks, worth testing 3 tho
1362 2018-02-15 18:56:30 Top stocks to take a look at imo: CNK, RGC, AMC. 2 report earnings on the 23rd for 4th quarter 2017. Movie pass up to 2m+ subscribers. Should bring a huge boost in earnings to all 3 theatres.  HMNY is the company that owns Moviepass. Just diluted their shares recently too 
1363 2018-02-15 18:56:29 No it IS about guns. Las Vegas was 5.5 months ago, but I guess it’s still too soon for the GOP to discuss banning bump stocks? #GunControlNow
1364 2018-02-15 18:55:51 Stop with the bullshit Republicans. There have been countless sensible gun laws put before you and nothing. Remember banning bump stocks? How about cutting education? So sick of hearing the same garbage. #GunReformNow #EnoughIsEnough
1365 2018-02-15 18:55:38 @SenSanders and @JimInhofe Why not work together and introduce a bill that permanently bans the sale of bump stocks and AR-15 ammunition to civilians? A fedral buy back of automatic weapons like the AR-15 would be nice, too. Possession of AR-15 ammunition would be a felony.
1366 2018-02-15 18:55:29 Look for stocks that are compressed and could explode like $FOSL
1367 2018-02-15 18:55:13 Didn't you say these same words after Las Vegas shooting? That you would do something..and you have done nothing. Bump stocks still available, no expanded background checks, removed legislation to make it easier for the mentally ill to get weapons, BLOOD is on YOUR hands
1368 2018-02-15 18:55:12 Haha, I like the idea of ETF's being a "gateway drug" into individual stocks (though it is probably the other way around)
1369 2018-02-15 18:55:11 14 day waiting periods
No sales by private owners
No sales at gun shows
10 rounds magazine limit
No bump stocks
No cranks
Licenses for all arms
Minimum age of purchase at 21
Assault rifle ban
Universal background checks
Domestic violence ban

OF COURSE this will help....
1370 2018-02-15 18:54:53 Puerto Rico?  
Charlottesville? 
Las Vegas? 
Ban on bump stocks and assault weapons? 
Parkland?! 
Allowing mentally deficient ppl to get gun permits! 
Russian Sanctions for election interference? Trump tax scam for the 1%?  
Russian cover-up- the Memo?
Protecting Americans? NOT
1371 2018-02-15 18:54:51 “The NRA is always against gun regs”...Well no shit, because give them an inch they immediately take a mile. The bill to ban bump stocks was prime example, “any device that can increase RoF” vague bullshit that they can start a creeping vine.
1372 2018-02-15 18:54:39 #SandyHook #Orlando #LasVegas #Parkland ~ reasons to not own gun stocks.
1373 2018-02-15 18:54:26 Do not compare stocks charts to crypto
1374 2018-02-15 18:54:13 Stand your ground is a valid self defense tool
mandates are a horrid idea, which is unconstitutional - it'll make guns crazy expensive - which is infringement.
Bump Stocks, etc, fine, no problem there.
background checks, again, fine, with limitations on the waiting period.
1375 2018-02-15 18:52:51 *stocks
1376 2018-02-15 18:52:29 You have a chance to do some good. Don’t miss this opportunity. BAN bump stocks ! BAN assault weapons ! Enhanced background checks ! SAVE OUR CHILDREN ! No tax breaks for the wealthy while taking away from Medicare Medicaid & food for the poor ! Wake up. Be loved or hated forever
1377 2018-02-15 18:52:17 Pharma stocks r falling much lesser even with bad news. Screen reading says turning point coming. Watchlist #Sunpharma #Lupin #DrReddy
1378 2018-02-15 18:52:11 To start:
-Mandatory background checks and waiting periods to purchase guns.
-Mandatory passing of a gun safety and competency test before purchasing/owning a gun.
-All guns must be registered.
-Civilians may not purchase or own automatic/semi-automatic weapons.
-No Bump stocks.
1379 2018-02-15 18:52:06 So here's the fucked up thing about the Parkland shootings yesterday: gun manufacturer stocks are up across the board on speculation that idiots are going to go out and buy more guns. This happens more or less every time there's a mass shooting that gets widespread attention.
1380 2018-02-15 18:51:47 Learning about stocks. About to start investing after I finish this book and get a broker . #ThinkingLongterm
1381 2018-02-15 18:51:25 Always buy stocks in 2 or 3 parts
1382 2018-02-15 18:51:21 #GunReformNow  my Start point. Ban all assault rifles, high capacity clips and bump stocks. Have a grace period to turn these in with a government buyback. After that, mandatory 20 year sentence with no early release if you are caught with these. Commit a crime with them , life.
1383 2018-02-15 18:51:02 NO citizen has reason to own an AR15.  
Call @GOP to ask them to Explain why AR15's, bump stocks, etc. should be sold to civilian population.
1384 2018-02-15 18:50:53 Something is seriously wrong about cement stocks. Many have broken down on charts..ACC, AmbujaCem, IndiaCem, Ultratech, Dalmia Bharat, etc
1385 2018-02-15 18:50:44 Nobody needs an AR-15 with multi round extended clips and bump stocks for Christ’s sake. I’m a gun owner and hunter. It usually takes 1 shot to kill a deer. These are made to kill people. Ban them NOW.
1386 2018-02-15 18:50:41 Again, how would enforcement have worked? Would the ATF use magic telescopes to figure out who had legally purchased the bump stocks so that they could be seized? 

You presented a few paragraphs as a "bill", and now are calling it a "minor addition".
1387 2018-02-15 18:50:24 I'm actually already in office. Started up golden state. I'm in Adam of me family see me hand dance oh no hans solo. I am no car and home no no can u help be me in villa hobo. I asked for riches for nothing. For enrichment was Mine indeed. In stocks my share is climbing marked 3
1388 2018-02-15 18:50:06 So what ever happened to banning bump stocks btw? Just a question...
1389 2018-02-15 18:49:58 Never.But it’s a mighty fine way of whipping their moronic supporters into a gun buying frenzy-no? Worked for pump-stocks after LV.
1390 2018-02-15 18:49:56 Kind of a boring day today! Having said that people that are selling stocks that they are confident in because of lack of volume really must struggle with patience.
1391 2018-02-15 18:49:40 The 2nd Amendment is not about MODERN military weapons, designed ONLY to kill people. The more these are sold in the public, the better chance that bad people get them. Should people have AR-15? bump stocks? AK-37s? How about rocket launchers, arent these arms too?
1392 2018-02-15 18:49:23 Well at this rate imaging to have to look at higher priced stocks. I like pullback plays and fib bounce shorts, but they all require some kind of momentum/volume for me to enter. Ye good that you can do both, I just prefer to master one or two strategies
1393 2018-02-15 18:49:15 While you're at it get some shoes in stock that fit women's actual feet instead of labelling a size 8 ( as once was ) as a size 10 plus no stocks of  size 11 - 12 = retail world gone MAD hey
1394 2018-02-15 18:49:10 From the retired cop in my family: 
"If they're so pro life & blue lives matter then why are they not standing in the front of the line demanding Kevlar-piercing bullets, bump-stocks and military hardware be regulated? Until they start working on that, I don't want to hear it."
1395 2018-02-15 18:49:04 Bump stocks: I agree, no reason. Cranks: sure. License: there is in some states. I don’t think it’s completely necessary. Child lock: do you mean safe keeping or a mechanism on the weapon? Minimum purchase age: why? 18 is reasonable. Assault rifle ban: 90% of murders are pistols
1396 2018-02-15 18:49:02 Hi Mike. We are committed to sustainability and our team are actively looking at alternative materials for our teabags. We also offer loose tea which is available in most large supermarkets – if you’d like any help finding a local store which stocks it, please drop us a message.
1397 2018-02-15 18:48:54 4. The number of bump stocks used is a basically insignificant statistic. 
5. Ergonomics of shotgun are identical
6.  Penetration is driven by many factors and ar-15 aren’t special that way. 
7.  Handguns are the actual choice of most murderers.

1483 2018-02-15 18:48:23 Have Background checks ... multiple lays and f defense. Bans on things like bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and others. The greatest preventer of mass shootings is response times (because the commit suicide) which would increase if we had armed guards at public schools.
1484 2018-02-15 18:47:46 I heard that @Jumpman23 will have a lot of stocks of the shoes THIS weekend?.. So ppl can get them the week after
1485 2018-02-15 18:47:19 The 2nd amendment states that the people have the right to bear and keep arms.  It does not state that the people have the right to bear assault weapons, bump stocks, military grade weapons.   It does not state that underage people have the right to bear AR-15.
1486 2018-02-15 18:47:15 High noise stocks are more likely to capture our attention. Even more likely to rupture our discipline. 
#vakrangee was a good lesson but with good stipend in pocket !!
1487 2018-02-15 18:47:08 Lindsey Graham: “I won’t vote to ban AR-15s. I will vote to ban bump stocks”. So @LindseyGrahamSC you support an individual’s ability to slaughter innocent children and will vote to ensure they do so with maximum casualties. @GOP
1488 2018-02-15 18:46:59 You are a twit. Restrictions on guns, banning of assault weapons, banning bump stocks are not taking away your fucking 2 nd amendment rights. Didn’t those kids have a right to live? Oh no you just protect fetuses. Once they are born, you let them die.
1489 2018-02-15 18:46:09 Hi Dave as the manufacturer of the product, we can only apologise, we can’t however control stocks in store.
1490 2018-02-15 18:45:59 @LindseyGrahamSC “I am not gonna vote to ban the AR-15, but I will vote to ban bump stocks.” So now he will ban a weapon used in the last mass murder, but the one used yesterday- ‘sure u can have a war weapon to hunt deer, that way you can get the meat and grind it with 1 shot’
1491 2018-02-15 18:45:24 Nah, just the AR’s and stocks that can make a semi automatic rifle into an automatic is a start..
1492 2018-02-15 18:45:10 Do you love books? If so, them maybe you should volunteer at Culture Stocks used bookstore in downtown Aurora! Email Volunteer@CultureStock.org for more details. #aurora #volunteer
1493 2018-02-15 18:45:10 So let’s put other things in place first: make schools less of a soft target and increase access to mental health. The gun control issue, while important, is a lost cause if we couldn’t agree to ban bump stocks a few months ago.
1494 2018-02-15 18:45:07 Can it really still be possible in this country to buy large amounts of Ammo and also have access to A.R. 15‘s and other assault rifles and bump stocks? Yep still possible! Because our leaders do nothing to change it.
1495 2018-02-15 18:45:02 @LindseyGrahamSC so you will vote to ban bump stocks, but not AR-15s? Those NRA gun manufacturers must not make bump stocks, huh?  Disingenuous and morally bankrupt. Stand up for America’s children. Shame on you.
1496 2018-02-15 18:44:57 Di na naturo ang mga pobreng taong ito. Mas maganda siguro kung sa mga stocks nyo na lang ilagay ang mga pera nyo baka sakaling safe pa sya.
1497 2018-02-15 18:44:54 @marcorubio You and every member of the @GOP who has voted against or torpedoed any reasonable gun restriction (remember bump stocks?) in favor of @NRA money has the blood of children on their hands. Don’t want to be blamed? Then DO SOMETHING!
1498 2018-02-15 18:44:53 No issues with citizens having the right to bear arms, it's constitutional.  With this said, I don't believe the Founding Fathers would concur with right to bear semi-automatic weapons with bump stocks!!!
1499 2018-02-15 18:44:24 The next town hall meeting I attend will include questions about banning assault rifles and bump stocks. Time to make people uncomfortable.
1500 2018-02-15 18:44:14 I just heard Lindsey Graham say he wouldn’t ban AR15 but he would ban bump stocks. This man didn’t use a bump stock to kill all of these kids but he did use an AR15. Vote Lindsey Graham out of office now because he doesn’t care about our kids or our safety. Vote him out.
1501 2018-02-15 18:43:32 Some of these shooters are kids who got their gear from parents. An expensive bullet tax and prison time for having untaxed bullets would help. Or we could pass gun control like outlawing bump stocks and AR-15s and similar type guns but since we don't know semantics, bullet tax.
1502 2018-02-15 18:43:25 One party doesn’t want bump stocks to be legal. The other party does nothing to regulate them.
1503 2018-02-15 18:43:22 COLONIAL CORPORATION stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
1504 2018-02-15 18:43:07 What about automatic and semiautomatic weapons, bump stocks??? Stop taking money from the @NRA. No one believes you are committed to anything but your own interests. Sell your sympathies to someone else Pat.
1505 2018-02-15 18:42:57 @SpeakerRyan Enough with thoughts and prayers. Enough with "ban the bump stocks." BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. The NRA is running our country and I am sick of seeing people be mowed down with guns that nobody has any need for. EVER. Except in the military.
1506 2018-02-15 18:42:39 Without banning a weapon outright. Yeah it’s a great thing. Like no more bump stocks.
1507 2018-02-15 18:42:37 How accurate do you have to be when you are shooting at a crowd that is unable to escape easily?   Are you saying bump stocks should be legal?   500 people shot in Vegas.
1508 2018-02-15 18:42:36 No one has ever proposed a “gun ban” in America, nor will anyone. People want things like bump stocks, military triggers and high capacity magazines banned. There is no reason why a civilian needs any of these things.
1509 2018-02-15 18:42:32 I got 3 people who signed up with my code over a month ago who havent finished signing up so i haven't been able to claim the free stocks. #dyinginside bc one could be a big one haha
1510 2018-02-15 18:42:27 Let's blame it all on Mental Illness, well you know....semi automatic guns are safe unless the handler is mentally ill. Bump stocks are only ordered by a Mentally Ill person...
1511 2018-02-15 18:42:02 Universal and improved background checks and a ban on all assault weapons and bumper stocks. Reinstate Obama's order that bans the very mentally ill from buying a gun, which Trump eliminated.
1512 2018-02-15 18:42:01 Except this: planes serve an important purpose to our society. AR-15's and bump stocks don't.
1513 2018-02-15 18:41:56 Depends, if you are talking about the 2nd amendment/changes, NO! Enforcing the laws on the books, BG checks at gun shows, Banning Bump Stocks, common sense law, etc.YES! Criminal  elements will always have access to guns, so will I to protect myself and my family!
1514 2018-02-15 18:41:53 in addition to regulating ar-15s and bump stocks, regulate profits in the gun industry
1515 2018-02-15 18:41:41 @Paul Ryan @SpeakerRyan Time for you to get off of your butt & to actually enact sensible Gun Reform Laws which strengthens background checks & speeds up the vetting, bans Bump Stocks & High Capacity Magazines for AR-15. Grow a spine and ignore the NRA & their campaign donations!
1516 2018-02-15 18:41:40 NRA owns us. 
We Need sensible gun laws. 
Right to bear arms not meant for high power assault weapons, silencers, bumb stocks. Meant for muskets, Bayonets revolvers, rifles self defense ,sport. Stop the madness - STOP NRA FROM KILLING OUR CHILDREN #VoteThemAllOut #Midterms2018
1517 2018-02-15 18:41:32 But we don't live in a "democracy" per se. We vote for politicians who either do or don't vote according to platforms they ran on. Platforms that are significantly impacted by lobbying such as the NRA. Remember bump stocks? No one gave me a vote on them...
1518 2018-02-15 18:41:32 Gartman: 

"Yesterday We Shorted Global Stocks; 

We Were Obviously Wrong"
1519 2018-02-15 18:41:31 And if your argument is that bump stocks should be illegal, we can talk. I won't budge on restrictions on firearms themselves.
1520 2018-02-15 18:41:29 Can we at least ban bump stocks? There was a lot of talk about it after Las Vegas and then nothing changed. Why should someone be able to replicate a banned weapon.
1521 2018-02-15 18:41:08 Buy more stocks
VIX is getting a woodly
1522 2018-02-15 18:40:59 Too many new investors came into the market thinking stocks only go straight up. Now that they’re seeing some red they’re looking to point fingers. They forget that time is on our side for most and don’t know that markets cycle.

1524 2018-02-15 18:40:24 Even if, doesn’t change the fact most of the terrorists today are choosing ARs and semi’s rifles with stocks on it as the weapon of choice... So our focus should be the guns

1527 2018-02-15 18:39:55 Dickweed, please. 

1. Much higher rate of fire.
2. More powerful projectile (dev. to circumvent Geneva Convention!)
3. High capacity mags avail.
4. "Bump stocks" still legal
5. Combat ergonomics
6. Rounds penetrate body armor
7. Popular with murderous assholes
1528 2018-02-15 18:39:19 i dont hear anyone argue 2 stock vs 3 stocks
1529 2018-02-15 18:39:07 So because people will still do harm we should make it easier for them with Semi Auto weapons, 30 round mags and bump stocks?
1530 2018-02-15 18:38:45 That's the point, my point to it was I think the accessories used to turn semi-automatic weapons into fully automatic weapons, like bump stocks and feather triggers should be banned for use. That and all future fire rate mods for said SA weapons.
1531 2018-02-15 18:37:43 @SpeakerRyan DO SOMETHING! Ban assault rifles-they are weapons of mass destruction! Ban bump stocks! Background checks for all gun purchases
1532 2018-02-15 18:37:37 So, try to capitalize on a complex social issue and death to win power?

Tacky.

Also, the GOP wanted movement on bump stocks and Dems killed it.
1533 2018-02-15 18:37:25 Bump stocks still aren't easy to accurately fire with. Clearly you've never used one. In order to be effective with one, you have to have enough hate in your heart and practice with the intent of taking human life. If that hate is there, it doesn't matter how many bans there are.
1534 2018-02-15 18:37:20 And they have no business having larger capacity magazines, bump stocks, military grade anything
1535 2018-02-15 18:37:11 Neon are lines with only glow, the glow Style is just an abuse of lights, not too many stocks, lights and overexposure of color
1536 2018-02-15 18:36:52 The only way to get a fully auto legally is it was from before 1986 (a law was passed then) and they’re crazy expensive, 10’s of thousands up to 100’s. Was Vegas shooters fully? I thought bump stocks were what he used. But yeah bump stocks are a whole different argument
1537 2018-02-15 18:36:40 The NOPA crush report for Jan 2018 was more than 2 million bushels less than trade expectations at 163.1 million bu.

1540 2018-02-15 18:35:33 And bump stocks. And high volume magazines.
1541 2018-02-15 18:35:25 Sure, let’s have armed securities at schools, I’m all for that idea. At the same time, let’s get rid of semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks. Let’s make BG checks a federal requirement. Let’s spend more on mental health. Let’s do all these things.

1547 2018-02-15 18:34:09 I think they want to tell themselves everytime something happens that *maybe* they can get the NRA to give on some little thing. Like the bump stocks. Those are for sale again now, in spite of their pretending they would be okay with making them illegal. They lie. Everytime.
1548 2018-02-15 18:34:04 When you wrong you wrong lol i can’t be mad  the Las Vegas shooter had fully auto though and with bump stocks you can make most semi’s kinda fully auto if they’re long rifles. Regardless, I still don’t see WHY citizens need fully auto, in any case tbh

1552 2018-02-15 18:33:08 Just like he looked at what to do about BUMP STOCKS? Empty words. Ryan lies and says nothing. His words are like air but worthless, since air does its actual job in keeping us all alive.

1556 2018-02-15 18:31:46 Will they now stop the mentally ill from buying guns? Outlaw bump stocks? Regulate or ban the sale of military assault weapons? I don't know any hunters that rely on assault rifles to fill their freezers.
1557 2018-02-15 18:31:44 The NRA isn't the problem.  We just need common sense laws.  Not an outright ban, but stronger restrictions on things designed to get around the law like bump stocks.  Preventing mentally ill and people under 21 from owning or purchasing. etc.
1558 2018-02-15 18:31:44 I’m so angry that I just checked out a shop where I live called BigBoyzGuns that stocks AR15s. I want to get 10 women friends and go there and ask to buy one with about 100 rounds of ammo each.
1559 2018-02-15 18:30:33 Tillinghast is actually more bearish on U.S. stocks than his current cash position indicates.
1560 2018-02-15 18:30:10 But, for starters, we could make it illegal to buy AR-15s. We could also ban bump stocks. We could also limit the amount of ammunition a person can purchase. We do it with Sudafed, after all.
1561 2018-02-15 18:29:57 Most bills cause problems for some people unintentionally. I cant see how a bill that would limit magazine size nation wide would cause problems yet, the NRA and other gun lobbyists oppose this. Same with bump stocks.
1562 2018-02-15 18:29:39 Hi there, yes I can see that it's neither stocked at the Banff Metro nor the Buckie Superstore. And the Keith Moss store only stocks the marinade. Having gone through all this trouble, do enjoy your meal when it’s done. Take care, - Kirsi
1563 2018-02-15 18:29:30 You're right. We should ban production or ownership of bump stocks. Make possession a 10 year minimum sentence.
1564 2018-02-15 18:29:25 .@SenatorRounds I really don’t give a fuck about law abiding citizens rights to bump stocks & AR-15s. Every country has citizens w/mental health issues but we’ve had #29in45days . So monitoring social media taking away 1st amend but not 2nd amend I don’t give a fuck about ur #61
1565 2018-02-15 18:29:22 Chris, spare a thought please for another Scottish icon, the wild Atlantic salmon.  Wild stocks have been decimated by having to run the gauntlet of sea lice contaminated salmon farms. Disease and pollution, stock mortality, seal deaths. #salmonfarming
1566 2018-02-15 18:29:13 Still, Tillinghast was willing to cross the picket line and buy some stocks during the February correction. “I wouldn’t say we loaded up the truck, but we packed the minivan in the last few days,” he says. “We bought a couple of financial and energy company stocks
1567 2018-02-15 18:29:01 This is well worth the read.  Also check out the linked article discussing how residential real estate has historically performed better in down stock markets.  The reason may inflationary spells:  real estate tends to appreciate, while stocks depreciate.
1568 2018-02-15 18:28:50 My take: shorting undervalued European stocks is not a winning investment strategy!  When those shorts are unwound European stocks will get another nice bump.

1576 2018-02-15 18:26:59 Thank you, even if it fails due to the GOP, for your push to ban bump stocks. We have to keep trying for common sense regulations.
1577 2018-02-15 18:26:52 How many deaths will it take for the GOP to do something about bump-stocks and universal background checks?  You are just a spineless puppet for the NRA.
1578 2018-02-15 18:26:31 The folks who shoot AR’s in the Covington Pike bottoms apparently learned about bump stocks after Vegas because I hear the idiots using them now behind the dealership. Very disconcerting to walk around the lot hearing them back there with zero concern for us.
1579 2018-02-15 18:26:29 So let's just keep semiautomatics legal and bump stocks while we continue to defund mental health assistance and offer no real support. Let's just keep doing nothing 
1580 2018-02-15 18:26:21 Don't take my beer! Now, that's just crazy talk! lol But seriously, a few common sense safety measures wouldn't hurt: close background check loopholes, banning bump stocks, banning people from buying who are on no-fly lists, etc.
1581 2018-02-15 18:25:52 Oh just like when you NRA got you to block the vote on bump stocks because the average person meeds them right. You sir are a Disgrace and have the blood of innocent children  on your hands
1582 2018-02-15 18:25:45 I'm watching you on #CNN & you truly sound so out of touch!!  You just said that #WeThePeople should invest in "defensive measures", if we didn't have bump stocks & assault rifles available to everyday #Americans to begin with we wouldn't have to worry about "defensive measures"!
1583 2018-02-15 18:25:02 Whatever be the value, these stocks coul well be hypothecated against some other lines of credit
1584 2018-02-15 18:24:56 @RusanLab sent us fly stocks we requested with the speed of light, even with an extra gift of 'if you want to try that strain, you might want to try this, too'. Thank you Nasser: Drosophila community is such a wonderful place to work in!
1585 2018-02-15 18:24:51 I don’t care if someone wants a pistol or a hunting rifle. Two of my brothers are gun owners, but it shouldn’t be a controversial opinion to think maybe semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks (or any military grade weapon) shouldn’t be made available to the public?
1586 2018-02-15 18:24:33 Folks, we had 851 injured and 58 people killed in Las Vegas. Absolutely NOTHING was changed. 

Remember good ole bum stocks. 

#GunReformNow
1587 2018-02-15 18:24:30 Thank you for your leadership. Closing the loopholes in our background check system, fully funding and expanding NICS, reinstating the ban on military-style weapons, bump stocks, and magazines AND requiring their forfeiture are all good starts #ExpectUs
1588 2018-02-15 18:24:28 I know bro that guy in the tower in Vegas with the revolver was certainly as deadly as the guy with an AR and bump stocks. Geeez people.
1589 2018-02-15 18:24:06 A lot of investors think Vix was the problem. So Vix down stocks up. But Vix is just a symptom of a wide ranging malaise. The real issues are valuations vs rates vs spreads. Plus leverage which is the way banks try to increase profits when liquidity is so cheap.
1590 2018-02-15 18:24:00 Higher priced stocks actually follow the rules of trends support/resistance a bit cleaner then cheep stocks don’t be me wrong I can’t wait for small cap land to light up again but I’m happy I got a few big bored trades under my belt it’s good to be able to do both
1591 2018-02-15 18:23:59 Congress needs to ban bump stocks and AR-15s and enact some type of reasonable gun control. Just to be clear, I'm not saying take everyone's guns away. But something has to change. #GunReformNow
1592 2018-02-15 18:23:51 Meanwhile, little looks cheap at home: “The average price/earnings ratio for the cheapest 20% of stocks in the U.S. market today is about 18. That’s higher than the cheapest 20% during the growth stock bubble of 1999 and 2000. That’s deeply frustrating.”

1596 2018-02-15 18:23:16 Thanks to our clown President @realDonaldTrump we are also becoming the laughing stocks and most hated nation around the world.
1597 2018-02-15 18:23:07 Tillinghast is actually more bearish on U.S. stocks than his current cash position indicates. He has a 38% position overseas, where he says valuations are more attractive, most notably 10% in small Japanese stocks. “Japan is earlier in its up cycle,” he says.
1598 2018-02-15 18:22:59 Brim there is a little bit of miss information in this, obtain your class III license is difficult but it's not impossible, 10k could get you a pretty cheat automatic rifle, Not all modifications are legal ex Echo trigger, bumb stocks.
1599 2018-02-15 18:22:59 I see stocks bundled into retirement plans. Just like in 2008, they will all lose most of that money when the market crashes again. Either way, the topic is the home being an asset. Assets put money in your pocket every month if you work or not. Taxes/insurance take out of pocket
1600 2018-02-15 18:22:58 cheaper to pay for 17 caskets than to ask thousands of gun shops to stop selling bump stocks or drum mags.
1601 2018-02-15 18:22:34 This Saturday 2.17 @FinishLine @Jumpman23 im ready i hope yall just got of stocks in make sure they dont sellout but ik the #Cement3s going to sellout that's a fact..
1602 2018-02-15 18:22:18 What will happen and should will be a significant lawsuit including the people  versus politicians and NRA and other groups that throw money at politicians that don't enact laws that protect the citizens.  Getting semii autos and tools like bump stocks will eventually happen
1603 2018-02-15 18:22:17 No one wants to take away gun rights. They want to ban assault rifles like the AR15 and bump stocks.
1604 2018-02-15 18:22:16 No not you, just in general i don’t get the logic in selling for cheap it’s a head scratcher haha just venting my frustration

1609 2018-02-15 18:21:13 Sooooo trading penny stocks is fun...
1610 2018-02-15 18:20:58 it is quite evident that the NRA condone the slaughter of our children. as they continue with the fight over bump stocks and assault weapons and maintain it says in the constitution it is the right of citizens to own them. that argument is old. the constitution does not.
1611 2018-02-15 18:20:45 I'd wager cost of contributions plus tapering annual allowance penalising accrual is a bigger contributor than LTA
1612 2018-02-15 18:20:45 @SpeakerRyan please stand up for our kids and bring legislation banning assault rifles, bump stocks, backgroung checks, whatever is needed to stop senseless violence!

1615 2018-02-15 18:20:10 congress will do what they always do: Such a tragedy, maybe we can talk about assaullt rifles. Next huge sales of assault rifles. (see bump stocks after Vegas), then congress does nothing (see bump stocks) except accept NRA cash
1616 2018-02-15 18:19:59 Probably people who bought and forgot then woke up to this.
1617 2018-02-15 18:19:30 Not many people have issue w outlawing bump stocks, I know I don't. What's an "assault rifle?" Legal definition please. Full autos are already illegal for most to own. The shape, look of a gun has nothing to do with # of rounds per minute or capacity. Thoughts before emotions!
1618 2018-02-15 18:19:04 Hey @realDonaldTrump 

Right now, today would be a good time to ban AR-15's and bump stocks.
1619 2018-02-15 18:18:55 ...and bump stocks do what to one of these ‘semi-automatic military-style not-quite-assault rifles’, exactly?

1622 2018-02-15 18:17:49 I’m not saying that *every* gun in the country should be relinquished. My dad was a hunter, and an expert marksman in the Marines, WWII. We need to get assault rifles and bumper stocks out of the general public. You don’t have to disband the NRA. Just stop lobbying to buy votes.
1623 2018-02-15 18:17:33 @SenDeanHeller  NO MORE ON WAITING THIS IS NOT THE TIME !  YOU ARE A FAILURE, WHAT ABOUT LAS VEGAS SHOOTING ?  DID YOU GO SEE THE BODIES ?

1624 2018-02-15 18:17:32 I can not deal with the crazies on twitter today.  If you are in favor of the NRA, private ownership of assault rifles, armor piercing bullets, bump stocks, or any other weapons of war on our streets, you are crazy.  You are wrong. PERIOD #GunReformNow
1625 2018-02-15 18:17:22 Incorrect if fires no more rapidly than any other semi automatic civilian weapon and reloads like any other semi automatic weapon.  Bump stocks are illegal everywhere I know of and they make them for many weapons.  Same with flash supressors.  Why is 30-06 vs .223 556 an issue.
1626 2018-02-15 18:17:03 How would limiting bump stocks have changed Vegas? What 1, maybe 5 less people would have died? Again... think past the tool and ask WHY did Vegas happen to begin with....
1627 2018-02-15 18:17:02 No none of them did, except for some that the vegas shooter had. But I feel all accessories that increase rate of fire on semi auto weapons, I.e. Feather triggers, bump stocks, shorter firing pins, should be illegal and have jail time attached to anyone who owns them.
1628 2018-02-15 18:16:53 I'm so sick of the right's response of "criminals don't follow laws, laws won't stop this"
Banning assault weapons for civilians seems like a good start. Make it way harder to modify weapons to fire faster (bump stocks) seems good.
1629 2018-02-15 18:16:50 I’ve actually been trading stocks over $10 lately more range they’re moving more I’m not as comfortable with them but that’s where the volume is right now

1636 2018-02-15 18:15:57 Also in Canada, assault-type rifles are restricted and must not be able to fire more than 5 rounds. Any modification can get you 14 years in prison, including bump stocks.

1647 2018-02-15 18:14:32 5 out of 10 deadliest mass shootings in last 3 years, 8 deadly school shootings so far in 2018, bump stocks were back on the market a month after the Vegas shooting.

1652 2018-02-15 18:14:04 Yes, I understand that fully automatic have been banned.  We won't agree because semi-auto is outside the bounds of hunting.  It's a mass killing device alone but when teamed with bump stock, not much difference than fully auto and we can't even get bump stocks illegal.
1653 2018-02-15 18:14:01 Did you all have assault rifles and automatic weapons and bump stocks and silencers? This is not a problem of liberals. The vast majority of gun nuts out there who commit mass shootings like this one turn out to be far-right, like this guy.

1656 2018-02-15 18:13:32 it isn’t even the whole gun, it’s extended mags and bump stocks
1657 2018-02-15 18:13:19 NOW is the time to do something sensible about gun control - no AK 15’s or 47’s, no bump stocks, no high capacity magazines, acceptance to let mental health professionals deny any guns to those it identifies, etc.   This change is not difficult.

The AR-15 is a weapon made to fire rapidly, reload quickly, flash-suppressed to conceal position, modular to add lethality, like bump stocks that make it damn-near auto...

1668 2018-02-15 18:11:54 I'm calling you names because I'm sick & tired of people giving accuses for inaction. It's too soon... What really happened in Vegas... Who shot JR... who the fuck cares. Bump-stocks aren't guns, so the 2nd A shouldn't apply. Just ban them, b4 17 deaths turns into 100 or 1000.

1670 2018-02-15 18:11:43 A moment of silence  how touching ! Get off your silent asses and do something about controlling bump stocks and assault weapons in our country!
1671 2018-02-15 18:11:27 When it happens to one of their kids.  They have the NRA so far up their collective asses it’s ridiculous. Own a gun. But there is ZERO need for mass killing machines or bump stocks. And MUCH better background checks.
1672 2018-02-15 18:11:26 "glorified hunting rifle" is maybe the largest over embellishment ever... You throwing bump stocks and extended magazines on hunting rifles these days?
1673 2018-02-15 18:11:18 I encourage all democrats,  black, brown, gay, and persecuted to run out and purchase ar 15s, bump stocks, and ammo. THEN gop will work w us
1674 2018-02-15 18:11:01 Handguns for self protection ... I get it. Rifles for hunting ... sure. But semi-automatic assault rifles or even semi-automatic handguns? Why does anyone need those? Bump stocks? Why does anyone need those for anything other than for mass killing?

1677 2018-02-15 18:09:59 I think the remaining argument would be - which increases relative lethality? A higher power weapon that you couldn't sneak anywhere or a weapon that you could take virtually anywhere without getting caught.

I think bump stocks changed my mind on the topic though.

1690 2018-02-15 18:07:48 Aside from the fact that this is a distinction without a difference - it is as if the Daily Caller missed the memo re how easily an AR-15 can be converted to fire on automatic and that bump stocks that make the semi fire almost as fast as an auto are readily available and legal.

1692 2018-02-15 18:07:20 Why are bump stocks still legal?
1693 2018-02-15 18:07:13 Its a lie. We fake invested into some real stocks for class lol
1694 2018-02-15 18:07:00 OMG!  Quit the drivel and sad face.  Bump Stocks need to be banned. Clips that hold more than 18 shells need to be banned.  These items need to be turned in to law enforcement.  Failure to do so will result in a fine.  No one will search your home for these.
1695 2018-02-15 18:07:00 Assault weapons ban, updated to include bump stocks and large capacity magazines. Close loopholes. More stringent and universal background checks. National database. Include DV protective order names. No names dropped from military. It can be done.

#GunControlNow
1696 2018-02-15 18:06:38 @JLewisTrading does it big for his members again, Last Night educating his peeps with dark pool foot prints in Stocks and ETF’s.   Just superb presentation! Great trading today can class. #stockTradinFool! #CanadianModernJessieLivermore
1697 2018-02-15 18:06:24 Make straw purchases, selling across state lines, bump stocks, hollow points, high-capacity clips, illegal.
Register guns, require training.
Make background checks, trigger locks, mandatory.
No gun show sales.
Invest in smart triggers.

There are plenty of things we can do.
1698 2018-02-15 18:06:03 Bump stocks banned? Uh-uh, no way José!
1699 2018-02-15 18:06:00 Traditional stocks don't offer as much excitement as tech - - more of tech listings needed ( not services type) to make the stock lively
1700 2018-02-15 18:05:57 Look into dividend stocks, perhaps? It's like putting money away and hording it, with potential for great return.
1701 2018-02-15 18:05:30 Three times “bonds” in the sane sentence..... Are your tired to diffuse your stupid forecasts on “stocks “?
1702 2018-02-15 18:05:25 Yes, I have seen such reports too. It shows the #CFP works. After a virtual ban cod stocks have recuperated. I eat cod quite often and the fish are larger now as well. It is a good thing.
1703 2018-02-15 18:05:03 Also your statement on law abiding citizens is flawed by your use of the word "only". For example: banning or limiting bump stocks is a form of gun control. A restriction on bump stocks could have decreased the total death toll in Las Vegas. We're none of them law abiding?
1704 2018-02-15 18:04:58 Ban bump-stocks.
1705 2018-02-15 18:04:53 You need a semi automatic rifle for self defense? Or hunting?

How many rounds a minute does that fire?

Do you support bump stocks?

Do you think Jesus would support both of those?
1706 2018-02-15 18:04:52 In a long distance journey (of wealth creation) where you have to change trains (stocks) 1000s of times or just a few times, which one will be easier, peaceful and less risky. Chances of wealth destruction r more in first one as u need perfect timing skills.
1707 2018-02-15 18:04:41 And occasionally you’ll get that wacky stock that goes up 600% in one day. Those are good days. Problem with penny stocks is once you go above the $1000 mark, you get into the ‘millions of shares’ and those are hard to sell in a panic. But then you can double that on a good day.
1708 2018-02-15 18:04:01 I know that but exactly how is saying bump stocks are legal a political statement?
1709 2018-02-15 18:03:54 100% think bump stocks should be illegal.
Democrats shot themselves in the foot by trying to lump other regulations in with the proposed ban.
1710 2018-02-15 18:03:50 A semi-automatic is a semi-automatic.  Lethality has nothing to do with things like pistol grips and folding stocks.  Most semi-automatic rifles use .223 or equivalent rounds whether for hunting or otherwise.
1711 2018-02-15 18:03:46 2)The NRA is demonized but isn't even the biggest lobby. They recently supported banning bump stocks and to date not a single shooter has been an NRA member which stresses safety and training.
1712 2018-02-15 18:03:34 Nice! Looking forward to tonight's monthly call, dollar down, stocks up trends still intact
1713 2018-02-15 18:03:32 Wow can't believer we have 19 stocks trend trading for over 1 year. We're making really good profits on all of them. BVZ Weekly Chart Rocks! Can't wait to attend your TGIF class soon again & continue this awesome legacy. We must have done something right in this class Coach! 
1714 2018-02-15 18:03:18 Bump stocks ....
1715 2018-02-15 18:03:10 Celebrate with us on Saturday. Spend $10.00 and get a bear FREE, while stocks last.
1716 2018-02-15 18:02:58 And bump stocks are still legal.
This Congress is unserious.
1717 2018-02-15 18:02:18 All stocks of all stores of Nirav Modi and Gitanjali Gems should be auctioned by gov't and recover what ever possible. All Gilli , nakshtra, norav modi outlets and property showrooms to be auctioned
1718 2018-02-15 18:02:13 Sure gun control could have avoided this massacre. Law against semi automatics rifles and bump stocks would have done the trick.
1719 2018-02-15 18:02:12 Europe Markets: European stocks finish higher as Airbus, commodity shares advance
1720 2018-02-15 18:02:07 Avoid this and that person.
Read the following books.
Buy the following stocks.
Look into Canadian or French visa.
1721 2018-02-15 18:02:02 What if we ban bump stocks? Won't help the last shooting, but it would have saved a lot of lives in Vegas.
1722 2018-02-15 18:01:45 Market Snapshot: Stocks on track for 5th straight daily advance in volatile session
1723 2018-02-15 18:01:22 I knew u will say that.. so it further boils down to maybe 500 stocks.. still..
1724 2018-02-15 18:01:21 but don't despair #GunLobby you can still buy all the bump stocks you want#GunReformNow
1725 2018-02-15 18:01:17 Stocks happy
1726 2018-02-15 18:01:16 Buying low P/E stocks works in both good markets & bad. You may have to wait a little longer for your return in a bear market. -- Chris Browne
1727 2018-02-15 18:01:12 remember when they were gonna ban bump stocks?
1728 2018-02-15 18:01:12 As far as I know but I could be wrong, bump stocks are a thing but they're also technically illegal?
1729 2018-02-15 18:00:58 As a firearm dealer, I am ok with bump stocks being banned. No one wanted the damn things until Vegas anyway. We clearanced them off our shelf a year before. Extended magazines don’t really affect anything except weight, tbh.
1730 2018-02-15 18:00:57 Nothing will be done. After Vegas, remember how everyone thought making bump stocks illegal was a simple & good idea?  And what happened? The NRA and Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The rabid dogs of the NRA are fear merchants of Slaughter and Death.
1731 2018-02-15 18:00:34 The action of bump stocks can be replicated with knowledge of technique. But that's the issue with all of these solutions: they all have holes. I don't agree when the right says it's not about guns. It is, but left is wrong to assume guns are at the center of the issue.
1732 2018-02-15 18:00:20 I chose those two based on their charts. I love charts. Single most important thing..their 52 week high and low. Penny stocks are very volatile day to day but not that volatile throughout the day tho I haven’t lost money. Haven’t always doubled either but that’s cool for now. :)
1733 2018-02-15 17:59:03 Go on YouTube and watch @timothysykes trader checklist it's absolutely free and it's like 12 hrs and defiantly in invaluable starting point to learning to trade the stocks we trade
1734 2018-02-15 17:58:57 IL voter here. I need you to speak more strongly and take real action. We need way more than banning bump stocks and marginally improving background checks. Bring back the assault weapons ban for starters. Fight as if children were dying--because they are!
1735 2018-02-15 17:58:45 Give back your NRA money and ban assault weapons and bump stocks.
1736 2018-02-15 17:58:36 $AMAT and $CY is doing the happy dance.  In it to win it.  #stocks #markets #nasdaq #TraderTips #earnings
1737 2018-02-15 17:58:17 I thought this page was to watch stocks. If I wanted to find out all about how bad the NRA is I'd go to NRA Watch. 

Please stop. 

Thx.
1738 2018-02-15 17:58:11 On this particular subject. I am uneducated regarding stocks and bonds, most things regarding the economy. I am educated, though.
1739 2018-02-15 17:57:59 #stocks  IBM still a great buy, especially now. Load up on it for its dividend within your Roth IRA or 401K.
1740 2018-02-15 17:57:56 More green a lots sale.people shorting stocks so back to Red again poor Intel
1741 2018-02-15 17:57:39 It's amazing that ammosexuals still follow a rule that was made over 200 years ago by a bunch of white dudes who had single load muskets that had low accuracy to degend their use of semi automatic death machines with multiple rounds, bump stocks, and magazines
1742 2018-02-15 17:57:39 Fine but until we reform the mental health system we should ban bump stocks, semi and automatic weapons and clips with more than 9 bullets.
1743 2018-02-15 17:57:11 This is your chance to show presidential leadership, You and Congress are more powerful than the NRA - We all implore you to work with Congress to make America Safe Again. You can start by banning assault weapons and bump stocks.
1744 2018-02-15 17:55:40 Yes, you are right.   $TRTN reports on the 22nd.   Read that $TRTN would report "on Thursday" and assumed that meant today.  

Who is the new competitor spooking the market?   The way these container stocks are reacting, it seems like Amazon.  (That was a joke.    I hope.)
1745 2018-02-15 17:55:33 Rifles specifically designed for war, to kill mass numbers of people in a short amount of time. Bump stocks, extended clips should also be made illegal.
1746 2018-02-15 17:55:18 Bump stocks 50% off.  Use promo code #MAGA or #GOPutin
1747 2018-02-15 17:54:58 Sane or Crazy, if the AR-15s and Bump Stocks are unavailable, it's a START.
1748 2018-02-15 17:54:48 Just curious Paul, how much $ have you rec’d from the NRA? Did you object to Trump’s decision last year to give people with mental illness full access to guns? Do you support an assault weapon ban? Bump stocks? Your words are meaningless.
1749 2018-02-15 17:54:33 The article says Feinstein spearheaded a bipartisan bill banning bump stocks but NRA opposed it and it stalled. Where does it say Dems blocked it?
1750 2018-02-15 17:54:31 By definition, investing in dividend initiators means buying non-dividend payers who will pay in the future. Also, how can one distinguish between dividend growers and dividend decliners? Isn’t this chart filled with hindsight bias? Like saying “buy stocks that go up”
1751 2018-02-15 17:54:28 Seems like there are better stocks.  $F
1752 2018-02-15 17:54:25 Stocks are better just get em cleaned n put led in them
1753 2018-02-15 17:54:19 I’m sad to say it but you’re right. Las Vegas got lip service about bump stocks from conservatives and even that melted away as the news cycle moved on.
1754 2018-02-15 17:54:13 Rs are in the majority.  As they’ve shown, they can do what they want.  Neither Cruz nor Cornyn have any interest in eliminating bump stocks.  I wrote & got a condescending letter back.
1755 2018-02-15 17:54:08 Couldnt buy a smith and wesson so i bought some stocks.
1756 2018-02-15 17:53:54 Remember when we were at least going to do something about bump stocks? (see below)
1757 2018-02-15 17:53:20 soon as we're told what stocks are doing the headline is dated because they're now doing something else.
1758 2018-02-15 17:53:14 Okay worse president ever? No he’s not. Stocks are a all time high, laws are changing for the good & most of all he wants America first! What did your POS president do? I’m waiting. that’s right he gave guns to cartels which sold them to criminalsbut tell me again whose the enemy
1759 2018-02-15 17:53:10 How many pages do you need?1. Ban bump stocks and cranks.2. Law enforcement can have them.It's the definition of a clean bill.
1760 2018-02-15 17:53:02 Return your NRA $.  Be a hero and pass common sense gun laws that the majority of the country wants: ban gun stocks, high capacity clips, restore the ban on assault weapons, including AR-15s, and install background check requirements.
1761 2018-02-15 17:52:31 Not at my Walmart...and I live in Texas. But...I’m no fan of bump stocks and I don’t think people “need” them.
1762 2018-02-15 17:52:27 beats the shit out of gripping especially since I’m on set rn filming for my own acting demo reel lol. 250 you ask? I know I know. Not much but I’m just getting started. Still learning. Haven’t showed you my legitimate stocks tho. My non-penny stocks. Na-ah. #ForMyEyesOnly xo
1763 2018-02-15 17:52:25 It would be so easy for you to sign an Executive Order today banning the sale of ANY and ALL assault weapons and bump stocks in the USA.   Assault weapons are not how citizens defend themselves, its how they kill innocent people.
1764 2018-02-15 17:52:24 Probably more likely to catch a bluegill depending on what the lake stocks
1765 2018-02-15 17:52:12 Alright now back to the shoutouts & love - first shout out of today goes to FinTwit Legend @MysteryMan_777 who is an all around amazing guy and trader! Always willing to help & knowledged in all forms of trading stocks and options this is a MUST follow for any trader new or vet
1766 2018-02-15 17:52:10 Outlaw bump stocks and high round clips.  Mandatory licensing, regulation, and insurance - just like cars.
1767 2018-02-15 17:52:04 Ban assault rifles, extended mags, bump stocks, etc, make background checks more extensive so it's not so damn easy for anyone to buy guns, fingerprint locks on guns, not allowing people on the no-fly list to buy guns, having a federal database, safety.. /1
1768 2018-02-15 17:51:59 I never said that. This is not my idea. My idea is that newbs are here to get rich quick, and will buy penny stocks because they perceive a crypto reboot as their chance for easy gains. I never said anything about the confirmation times/fees being the instigation.
1769 2018-02-15 17:51:58 Tutulog na lang ako huhuhu bahala na if mag stocks pa pagkagising ko 
1770 2018-02-15 17:51:40 Yes, unless it's an inaccessible part. I've worked in a prison, I've seen what humans can do even without the proper resources.  You take away mods, they'll fund a way to modify without the bump stocks
1771 2018-02-15 17:51:39 Still waiting for Congress to outlaw bump stocks after Las Vegas too! When GOP isn't helping the rich get richer they are waging war on education. I'll be damn sure not to trust Trump on this issue.
1772 2018-02-15 17:51:13 Although most people may not know the correct terms, what they mean when they say AR ban is AR-15s plus.  semi, or non semi w/ use of bump stocks.  Are you really going to tell me that legal modifications to AR-15s cannot make them military grade?
1773 2018-02-15 17:51:10 Responsible gun control , that's all we need. No automatic assault rifles , no bump stocks , no 30 round clips .  Used to be max 10 round clips . Most shooters are taken down when they try to reload .That would be a start along with good background checks . Gun registration.
1774 2018-02-15 17:51:10 1. It was designed for military use so you’re wrong.
2. It doesn’t have to be automatic to shoot 500+ rounds per minute so you’re wrong.
3. It’s not designed nor commonly used as a hunting rifle, so you’re wrong.
4. Ban bump stocks & ext’d. mags. Make it harder to own one. Think?
1775 2018-02-15 17:51:05 No, it does not say it all, because there was AS USUAL more than that in the proposal. If bump stocks were all there was, it would have breezed through.

1777 2018-02-15 17:51:02 Antitrust can help to the extent that billionaire's money is in stocks. The way it helps is because it reduces stock market value that is based on future expected monopoly rents.
1778 2018-02-15 17:50:50 It’s to easy to get a gun!!   We have to make it at least harder. There is absolutely NO NEED for bump stocks or automated rifles. ABSOLUTELY NO NEED!!!!
1779 2018-02-15 17:50:14 Thinking small is better than being delusional. GDP of US is 1/5 of the GDP of the entire world.

1780 2018-02-15 17:50:10 Bump stocks are an accessory not a physical attribute of the AR15. After hearing and seeing the sound analysis I am not convinced it was an AR 15 at all.

I listen but make my own decisions this gave me a different perspective and for that I thank you. Adding more gnrc today.  season is here....takes1
1784 2018-02-15 17:49:49 Your point to owning Semi automatics, bump stocks?
1785 2018-02-15 17:49:33 @marcorubio Senator, you mentioned the purpose of our gov’t stated in the preamble- that it takes precedent over the 1st AND 2nd amendments...wouldn’t you agree that removing bump stocks/ARs from the legal market is a fairly simple solution that does promote domestic tranquility?
1786 2018-02-15 17:49:28 If your “thoughts and prayers” worked, #Parkland wouldn’t have happened. Or #LasVegas, or #Orlando, etc. #StopGunViolence #DoYourJob 
 Ban bump stocks, silencers & AR-15.
1787 2018-02-15 17:49:23 Why didn't @realDonaldTrump and you do something/anything about AR-15/bump stocks after PULSE?
1788 2018-02-15 17:48:59 Get rid of him or have him report the stocks or something keep him from the tragedy’s
1789 2018-02-15 17:48:55 Gun stocks are rallying after the massacre, illustrating how the sickness feeds off itself
Sturm Ruger (+2.8)
 American Outdoor Brands (+5.6) on Wednesday afternoon.
1790 2018-02-15 17:48:43 SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT STRONGER GUN CONTROL!!! No more political contributions from the NRA towards You or ANYONE!! 3week Stronger vetting for new gun buyers! No Bump Stocks! Make records of high volume Ammo Purchases or Explosives...etc!   GUN CONTROL NOW TRUMP!!!
1791 2018-02-15 17:48:14 Cine stills, it's an Indy film brand that makes some interesting film stocks. This one is great for artificial light at night, cool neons
1792 2018-02-15 17:47:49 Taking sides?  Like having reasonable gun laws?  Oh, I forgot...we always have to wait until months later and then nothing gets done...Remember Bump Stocks!  Where did that go...down the rabbit hole!
1793 2018-02-15 17:47:37 1)  The ATF can not create laws.
2)  The article is full of willful lies.
3)  Bump stocks do not automagically create automatic fire.  It's still a learned skill.  That skill, BTW, can be learned with a shoestring or simply practicing with no additional hardware.
1794 2018-02-15 17:47:02 Amazing how the USA can be both the laughing and crying stocks of the world.
1795 2018-02-15 17:46:49 I am long few stocks because of Value (in the way I can understand). But don't get how PSU Banks are Value given that they don't even trade at say 0.5x to book :)
1796 2018-02-15 17:46:38 So...a 19 year old maladjusted kid steals 17 lives and all of cable news for a couple of days. We all learn he had personal problems. Like the guy in L.V., or Virginia Tech, or Newtown. Yadda yadda yadda. NRA owns Congress. Bump stocks still legal. Same old same old.#GunReformNow
1797 2018-02-15 17:46:36 You mean the one I just posted? The one that did nothing except ban bump stocks and the GOP leadership still refused to bring to the floor?
1798 2018-02-15 17:46:13 Give us some hint.. u are talking about guessing from good 5000 odd stocks dada
1799 2018-02-15 17:46:05 @SpeakerRyan - Dear NRA  recipient: Since now is not the time to talk about #GunControlNow can you please add it to the list after ‘bump stocks,’ which you still have not addressed?
1800 2018-02-15 17:45:56 No you're right, sounds like bump stocks & range are the two legitimate criticisms of ar15s.

Are bump stocks easy to setup? It seems like anyone one w the aptitude to significantly modify their gun like that  would have the aptitude to figure out a mass killing. But good point.
1801 2018-02-15 17:45:21 When would be the right time? Because Sandy Hook was awhile ago and not a thing has been done. Now, another tragedy has taken place and it really is on Congress to come up with a plan. Maybe assault weapons or bump stocks. Just something, please!
1802 2018-02-15 17:45:15 First you have to define gun control because if you don’t it’s pointless. Look at Las Vegas for example, the shooter had a bump stock which turns a semiauto into basically full auto. It is reasonable to say that bump stocks should be banned.
1803 2018-02-15 17:45:09 If the Democrats care about bump stocks, where's the bill?
1804 2018-02-15 17:45:00 But bump stocks are legal and plentiful. They turn a semi automatic weapon into an automatic one. Just semantics.
1805 2018-02-15 17:44:49 We remainers are devastated - this is disgraceful - we need another referendum for all of the UK wherever they happen to be. These Tories should be put in the stocks and pelted with eggs - Boris, Gove & Cameron
1806 2018-02-15 17:44:47 Try to know about this copmany. Not much info. What y know about it please
1807 2018-02-15 17:44:44 Well I can only really give you my viewpoint. I’ve been a Eurosceptic since before it was cool, and in order for that real change we all want to see, we need a clean break from the EU. From CET. From disastrous buffer stocks. Let’s have consumers take back control.
1808 2018-02-15 17:44:41 @JimBeamUK can you tell me who stocks Maple in the UK please? None of the supermarkets seem to have it. Thanks.
1809 2018-02-15 17:44:35 were a bit overwhelming at times. Wario, like most heavies, enjoys rage and Ling was consistently sealing my stocks sub 130% for the most part. Granted, Ling is also a better player than me so maybe my judgement is clouded! I put it somewhere between even and -1
1810 2018-02-15 17:44:24 3) no one has said “take all the guns!” Thats a line of shit fed to you by the NRA. People *have* suggested a ban on assault weapons, ban on people on watch lists and no fly list, ban bump stocks, stronger back ground checks, this legislation either stalls or gets overturned.
1811 2018-02-15 17:44:13 Two stocks that could move up with btc. Both operate in the crypto/blockchain world.
1812 2018-02-15 17:43:40 I think we close flat on the day, pain starting tomorrow and continuing Monday. Will look very similar to feb 1, dollar oversold yields spike up (yields spikehappened yesterday) stocks flat and can’t break resistance, next day dollar gets bought up and smacks stocks to the floor
1813 2018-02-15 17:43:27 This is #rubiomassacre2018, which follows #rubiomassacre2016 (pulse). Keep praying @marcorubio , its obviously working better than enacting legislation to
1) outlaw assault rifles
2) outlaw bump stocks
3) regulation of weapons markets
#GunControlNow
1814 2018-02-15 17:43:27 Pulling up the Crash Course  1 how to hold and sell stocks instead of watching my positions.
1815 2018-02-15 17:43:19 Senator - some thoughts.   When the HELL will 2nd amendment zealots learn that more guns means more deaths.   No bump stocks. No Countrywide Concealed Carry Reciprocity. No cop killer rounds. No super shooter magazines. No sales without completed background checks.
1816 2018-02-15 17:43:03 #Q13News #Q13Fox Knee-jerk reaction, as usual, banning bump stocks. Next thing, they will want to ban matches and lighters because they can light fuses on bombs and incendiaries. Shooters who want them will get them, legal or otherwise.
1817 2018-02-15 17:42:53 Don’t republicans control the house? Did they pass a bill banning bump stocks in the House? They could make Ds filibuster in the senate if they wanted to.
1818 2018-02-15 17:42:46 But it would be better that there would be less mass shooting right? there definitely wouldn't be at least 12 school shootings in two months if we had at least one working law to regulate guns or in this case banning assault weapons bump stocks and the etc to civilians.
1819 2018-02-15 17:42:40 Return your NRA $.  Be a hero and pass common sense gun laws that the majority of the country wants: ban gun stocks, high capacity clips, restore the ban on assault weapons, including AR-15s, and install background check requirements.
1820 2018-02-15 17:42:33 What about bump stocks? Don't they make a semi-automatic automatic? What is your opinion about the failure to outlaw bump stocks after Las Vegas?
1821 2018-02-15 17:42:28 wow @stockchartscom added CSE stocks.  RIP to all other platforms 
1822 2018-02-15 17:42:08 The guns weren’t illegal. The bump stocks were illegal. He bought the guns legally. Then customized them. Making them not street legal.
1823 2018-02-15 17:42:05 Oh, sure. I’m actually talking about gun control for the Vegas victims. It’s not too early to talk about them, right? Anyway, why don’t we ban bump-stocks? That’s not a gun! That’s not in the 2nd Amendment. #GunReformNow #GunControlNow #TheResistance #BlueWave2018
1824 2018-02-15 17:42:00 2018 Senate Accomplishments:
Ban bump stocks 
Same day voter registration 
Ban conversion therapy

AND we’re not done yet!
#puttingpeoplefirst #waleg
1825 2018-02-15 17:41:59 And if it's "too soon" to talk about, then maybe we should start talking about Vegas and the mass shooting that took over 50 unsuspecting lives. Ban bump stocks and assault rifles. Background checks. Close the loopholes. #GunReformNow #GunControlNow
1826 2018-02-15 17:41:55 Good I invested about a thousand into them in stocks maybe if you keep purchasing stuff from them and talk about them the market of them will go up 
1827 2018-02-15 17:41:54 ...or banning bump stocks, or banning hand guns, or banning assault rifles, or banning semi-automatics, or.......
1828 2018-02-15 17:41:45 1. Ban high-capacity magazines (over 6 rounds). 
2. Ban "bump stocks" and other devices intended for the sole purpose of simulating fully-automatic fire. 
3. Background checks for ALL firearm AND AMMUNITION purchases and transfers, including gun shows and private sales.
1829 2018-02-15 17:41:41 Give me the % of shootings that had bump stocks.
1830 2018-02-15 17:40:58 To me, #stocks are nearing the end of a much needed and healthy shakedown. The #economic backdrop remains stellar, earnings growth is the best in many years, and monetary policy will remain supportive as #inflation continues to undershoot. The bull is alive and kicking!
1831 2018-02-15 17:40:53 I mean, just earlier in the current General Assembly session here in Virginia a bill that would outlaw bump stocks was killed in committee. Even had a Virginian who was present during the Vegas shooting plead her case to no avail.
1832 2018-02-15 17:40:44 Who cares if he carried them up himself or had 10 porters help him... WTF does that have to do with using bump-stocks to vastly increase the number of bullets rained into this crowd. Continue investigation for sure, but in the meantime, ban the sale of bump-stocks, now.
1833 2018-02-15 17:40:23 Damn $TOPS move, this is a hard stock to trade $0.1965 would have been my entry if I wanted to trade it. If you can get in and out. Please do I hate trading shipping stocks
1834 2018-02-15 17:40:14 Bump stocks can be made at home. Start with background checks
1835 2018-02-15 17:39:35 Ryan gets millions from the NRA to stop any reasonable legislation to improve the safety of Americans. Remember bump stocks?  Universal background checks, limiting anything. Lots of ideas but Ryan blocks them all. Finds time for donors not saving lives
1836 2018-02-15 17:39:34 to the lowest ever in 25 YEARS

Banned
Semi-auto self loading rifles & shotguns, bump stocks & imposed stricter licensing & registration requirements

It implemented a mandatory buyback program for 1996 banned firearms
Ammended in 2002 restrict caliber, barrel length & capacity
1837 2018-02-15 17:39:30 Hey @chiweethedog how are the gun stocks today
1838 2018-02-15 17:39:22 Obama is the reason we have bump stocks
1839 2018-02-15 17:39:03 You're actually making my point here. The party in power WILL get votes on the things it considers priorities. The Dems pushed through Obamacare, the GOP pushed through a tax bill.

If the GOP cares about bump stocks, where's the bill?
1840 2018-02-15 17:39:01 Eso pasa. Pero el caso es otro: trabajan stocks del orto.
1841 2018-02-15 17:38:28 No. Easy access to guns for people who have zero business owning them creates this. Access to semi automatic guns & bump stocks create this. Willful ignorance of reality & spouting platitudes of thoughts & prayers creates this. You’re part of the problem.
1842 2018-02-15 17:38:27 Apples & Oranges argument. Junk stocks dominated the run up to 1929's stock market crash. Today's stocks actually have redeemable value, backed by profitable businesses. You mention coal miners: under Obama, they were unemployed. Today, they work & contribute to their retirement.
1843 2018-02-15 17:38:04 @SenFeinstein 
Keep fight! The majority of Americans are with you on your fight. We need to ban assault weapons, AR-15's, bump stocks, human killing machines. Keep fighting!
#GunControlNow
1844 2018-02-15 17:38:01 Responding to 18 MORE dead on top of all the others is knee jerk?   Really? No one needs an AR 15!  Ban assault rifles and bump stocks.  You only need a second to think that one through if you have half s brain. Or really no brain at all!
1845 2018-02-15 17:37:58 Bout to get my taxes, this accident check & a refund check soon  I’m investing 95% of it right back into myself. Apartment, MacBook, studio equipment, books, savings, stocks & bonds
1846 2018-02-15 17:37:54 Are there any websites/blogs that analyze quarterly earnings reports and conference calls? #stockmarket #stocks #investing #investments
1847 2018-02-15 17:37:38 No! All semiauto (legal)works exactly the same. One bullet per trigger pull.
That is exactly what the lying media want you to believe that the AR15 (legal-civilian)is a legal fully automated machine gun, it's NOT.
And yes, bump stocks should be banned.
1848 2018-02-15 17:37:28 After the Las Vegas shooting gun nuts criticized ppl for "politicizing" the event. "Wait for debate"  The debate never came.  Bump stocks were never restricted. The #NRA strategy of "wait until it blows over" and loses any steam is in full swing.
1849 2018-02-15 17:37:28 Usually I’m in line with your takes but not here. The fact the left was running down their laundry list shouldn’t stop the right from addressing bump stocks (that help bury a lot of folks in Vegas). The left’s bitching just gave the right cover to cave & satisfy the NRA.
1850 2018-02-15 17:37:25 #ThoughtsAndPrayersAreNotEnough Take Action - ban silencers, ban bump stocks, ban sale of AR-15, vote against concealed carry.
1851 2018-02-15 17:37:22 @POTUS The folks at ATF who approved bump stocks need to be fired ASAP
1852 2018-02-15 17:37:22 If a clean bill to ban bump stocks came to the floor today, it would pass tomorrow
1853 2018-02-15 17:36:58 Exactly! It’s a one issue  election. Guns are the issue. Particularly assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. Don’t vote for anyone who thinks the right to bear arms is about bearing those arms!
1854 2018-02-15 17:36:37 I agree with the bump stocks thing. Its a cheat around a poorly written law. If we decide full auto is illegal, we shouldn't allow a bump stock to cheat around that intent. You missed binary triggers, which is a similar cheat...
1855 2018-02-15 17:36:35 The NRA opposes all gun regulations. They are all for no controls. Bump stocks are still legal! The NRA is a toxic body that is the face of America's shadow. It's time for that to come to an end. Doing my part!
1856 2018-02-15 17:36:32 California legislated the issue, no large changeable clips, no folding stocks, etc.. if memory serves me. Doesn’t seem like a stretch.
1857 2018-02-15 17:36:22 @jonfavs Mark instead your bad stats let's talk about the ultimate impact of the greater GOP rolling back the automatic weapons ban or the uncleared outlaws currently in the WH who rolled back impediments to terrorists & the mentally ill getting guns & support bump stocks
1858 2018-02-15 17:36:10 Trump should order the BATF to simply rule on Bump Stocks and be done with it.  It is within their purview
1859 2018-02-15 17:36:09 @NC_Governor  start with an executive order banning the sale of AR15s, clips with more than a 9 shot capacity, bump stocks and silencers and smoke grenades. it will be challenged in court and probably over ruled but it would be a start and show a commitment, I'll support you 100%
1860 2018-02-15 17:36:07 Joe believes in common sense firearms regulation. He knows common sense laws like background checks & waiting periods don't infringe on 2nd amend. rights. 

Joe is currently cosponsoring his colleague Senator Cecil Thomas' bill to ban bump stocks. But that cannot be all we do. 1/
1861 2018-02-15 17:35:56 More major mass shooters (incl. Columbine, VATech) used handguns, and except LV, a handgun would’ve been more useful to the shooter in the rest.
Bump stock ban: Bump stocks are stupid. But, anyone can improvise one and they’ve been used in exactly one shooting.
1862 2018-02-15 17:35:50 .@bessbell I’m so very proud of you! You are honoring your classmates by fighting for them. Things HAVE to change. No one needs an AR-15 or bump stocks. #GunReformNow #MentalHealthMatters #BanAssaultWeaponsNow
1863 2018-02-15 17:35:45 Election year ! Nothing will be done just like after Las Vegas bump stocks months later nothing done .Paul Ryan said this is not the time ? Again he said the exact same thing after Vegas. Ryan has gladly taken the NRA money . GOP will do nothing to gun laws # election 2018
1864 2018-02-15 17:35:36 Not much we can do either. We can plead all we want, but the ones with money will defend their own stocks and interests.
1865 2018-02-15 17:35:17 They haven't to my knowledge, and I wouldn't be against banning bump stocks. I do question what, if any, impact it would have though.
1866 2018-02-15 17:35:16 There are actually more than a few battles of the time that the majority of casualties were caused by bayonets, knives and blunt force trauma from the barrels and stocks of muskets than projectiles being fired. The Minie ball changed all that in 1848.
1867 2018-02-15 17:34:54 Someone tweeted this a while back, "Stop giving these large banks your money. Open a bank account with your local community bank. They will treat you much better! Then buy some stocks in it if available!" Which is so true! $WFC $JPM & these other large banks suck IMO!!!!

1871 2018-02-15 17:34:21 Pretty much says nothing at all.  Congress, bump stocks, NRA have no significance, only the derangement of a sick individual.
1872 2018-02-15 17:34:20 It's opex so noisy, but $EURUSD is selling off divergence for stocks
1873 2018-02-15 17:34:10 Why are even bump stocks still legal?   Congress hasn’t even done the horribly obvious simple thing as that?
1874 2018-02-15 17:34:03 And it is a travesty that months after Las Vegas, bills to ban bump stocks -- which turn a lawful gun into a weapon of mass destruction -- have stalled in both Congress and the House of Delegates.
1875 2018-02-15 17:34:00 Can the Right do ONE FUCKING THING about it? Jesus, you couldn't even ban bump stocks.
1876 2018-02-15 17:33:51 On the other hand, Bump Stocks, that effectively convert semi-automatic weapons to automatic weapons are still legal.
1877 2018-02-15 17:33:45 Yes, yes we do. I lt’s not about all or nothing, it’s about saying “hey, maybe a civilian does not need an automatic or semi automatic gun, or bump stocks” but it’s not about banning all guns, but the ones that are unnecessary for practical reasons, like hunting or defense
1878 2018-02-15 17:33:28 What’s your thoughts on bump stocks
1879 2018-02-15 17:33:25 $BTC #BITCOIN above $10.000
1880 2018-02-15 17:33:15 Yes....How long did Vegas stay in news cycle? 500+ ppl! What was done? NOTHING! Can't even get bump stocks banned!
1881 2018-02-15 17:32:57 Our conclusion is that school shootings cannot happen without guns. Current laws make guns widely available to anyone who wants a gun. We demand that assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks be made illegal to sell, purchase, or possess. Immediately!
1882 2018-02-15 17:32:54 They came up with a ban on bump stocks, R's wouldn't bring it up for a vote.
1883 2018-02-15 17:32:53 It is shameful that this continues to happen! Meaningful gun laws must be passed! No one should be able to buy rifles like these, bump stocks, or high count magazines.  Ryan and other politicians always say it is too early to talk about this! GOP is morally bankrupt!
1884 2018-02-15 17:32:53 Would it be sound and sensible to ban bump stocks?
1885 2018-02-15 17:32:52 Remember bump stocks? The things that turn an innocent little AR-15 into a full-throttle machine gun? Yeah, congress couldn't even ban those.

1887 2018-02-15 17:32:48 “We are here for you — whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain,” Trump said. 

Here's a short list: 1) Ban on the sale of AR-15s and other weapons of war; 2) Ban on the sale of bump stocks; 3) Reinstate Obama-era mental health restrictions on gun ownership.
1888 2018-02-15 17:32:46 Remember when Republicans said they wanted to ban bump stocks?

1893 2018-02-15 17:32:05 That has nothing to do with your original comment about people wanting to buy straight up full autos... totally different conversation... and I wouldn't tell you that, I would tell you he had multiple weapons with re-fire stocks.

1896 2018-02-15 17:31:48 Bump stocks are garbage and should be banned. It’s not sport, it’s not skill, it’s showing off or causing harm.
1897 2018-02-15 17:31:41 Bump Stocks is the "they" I was referring to.
Why anyone would ever need to own this type of weapon (and yes, I am a gun/handgun owner) is something I simply cannot understand.  That being said, I suppose your list covers it.
1898 2018-02-15 17:31:25 Both have stocks, both has a scope, the killers grip is  better than the the magazine one soooo, I really don't see a huge difference to point out that it's a magazine pic
1899 2018-02-15 17:31:18 not looking for excitement, just some stocks to make some moves so i can trade them lol
1900 2018-02-15 17:31:08 It's a way to get around the automatic ban. The gun is still semi automatic, you are just pulling the trigger close to the rate of a fully automatic gun. I am in favor of making bump stocks illegal though.
1901 2018-02-15 17:31:03 What a sorry excuse for a leader.  This guy is totally being handled by special interests.  We need a ban on assault and military style weapons, bump stocks, armor piercing rounds, and silencers, and we need it yesterday.

1903 2018-02-15 17:30:53 Every time we have a mass shooting, the #Republicans say the person was mentally ill, instead of talking about #guncontrol. What about the #LasVegasShooting?

1906 2018-02-15 17:29:57 After Vegas, I called @RepRutherfordFL's office & a staffer reassured me he'd signed a letter "to the NRA" asking them to regulate bump stocks. She was wrong - letter was to AFT - but a telling mistake: Congressional staffers think NRA is in charge b/c they are.

1908 2018-02-15 17:29:28 I can be a pragmatist. Within the framework of 2A I am for handgun possession for self-defense/rifles for hunting but against laws like FL's Stand Your Ground law, semi-automatics, & gun stocks. I'll be avoiding travel south of the Mason-Dixon Line.
1909 2018-02-15 17:29:27 Losing investors buy stocks going down to "dollar cost average" and sell stocks going up because "it's never wrong to take a profit"
1910 2018-02-15 17:29:26 Im not sure what the anwser is. I live in Canada and we have guns here of course but nowhere near like in the US and we just don't have anywhere near the amount of gun violence. I think banning assault rifles is a good idea. At least ban bump stocks.

But there won’t be any action on: regulating ARs and AKs, increasing background checks, banning criminals and mentally challenged people from purchasing guns, regulating bump stocks. #GunReformNow

1921 2018-02-15 17:28:40 Oh remember, we were going to ban bump stocks immediately. ALL of congress spoke of it.... but nothing was done, and nothing will be. I thought once the GOP guy was shot , we’d see changes. Maybe when one of their kids are a victim?
1922 2018-02-15 17:28:07 I'm curious on your opinion of high capacity magazines and bump stocks? How about gun show purchases and private sales of firearms? A conversation needs to be had. Hold an individual accountable for their actions but also hold lawmakers and politicians accountable.

1924 2018-02-15 17:27:47 @sethmoulton Congressman what’s your solution? Isn’t this as much an individual state law issue as its federal? Bump stocks is federal but in your opinion shouldn’t states address? Is this also a law enforcement issue due to FBI being notified?
1925 2018-02-15 17:27:30 Bump stocks turn semi autos into autos.

1928 2018-02-15 17:27:00 Nobody is threatening the right to own guns.  However assault rifles and bump stocks need to be more regulated.  Gun laws that work in Alaska and Wyoming don't work in Detroit and LA.  THINK!!!
1929 2018-02-15 17:26:56 I guess on a positive note, my stocks look a lot better than last week
1930 2018-02-15 17:26:45 Lžete. Pouze Massachusetts zakazuje prodej a držení bum stocks. Prodej je ještě zakázaný v NY a NJ, A NRA, tu bandu hlupáků, snad ani nezmiňujte.
1931 2018-02-15 17:26:40 Congress. DO SOMETHING. No one needs semi automatic assault rifles. No one needs bump stocks. No one needs 10+ round mags. This cannot keep happening. 

Sincerely,

The American people
1932 2018-02-15 17:26:39 I have never heard anyone question whether they increase casualties. That is their purpose. After Vegas congress said they would "look at" bump stocks, don't think any Rep said anything about them being banned. Dems can't get ANY gun control bill to the floor, GOP won't allow it.

1934 2018-02-15 17:26:24 Bump stocks agreed, but that’s not an AR problem, hellfire triggers are almost unheard of but same issue as bump stocks— bump em. You overestimate the effictiveness of a fore-grip, and there are dozens of guns out there with 30+ rounds in a mag. It’s not the AR that’s the issue.
1935 2018-02-15 17:26:06 Nothing changed even after Las Vegas... No banning of bump stocks ... Nothing changed after Sandy Hook... We can go on and on and on. They are owned by the NRA and thats the sad brutal truth
1936 2018-02-15 17:26:01 uh, no.  There’s no incentive to do great.  Punch in, punch out.  No overtime, no stocks... see DMV, TSA, USPS...
1937 2018-02-15 17:25:55 Now keep an eye on the stocks. That's all I'm sayin.
1938 2018-02-15 17:25:47 I bet all these people defending their rights to own an AR-15 with bump stocks are the same people who want to outlaw abortion because all lives matter.

#GunControlNow
1939 2018-02-15 17:24:55 I think most sane people would want to ban machine guns (or, whatever you want to call the AR-15)... but, since the government can't even figure out a ban on bump stocks, maybe Americans need to elect people that will take action.
1940 2018-02-15 17:24:42 Now - Vote against - bump stocks; Countrywide Concealed Carry  Reciprocity; cop killer rounds; super shooter magazines; and gun sales  without completed background checks.
1941 2018-02-15 17:24:28 Apple stocks climbing, is this because buffett exited IBM and now with Apple? 
1942 2018-02-15 17:24:15 Another day, another horrific mass shooting.
Same political playbook:
Left bleats about gun control and bump stocks, Right accuses Left of politicizing tragedy. 
#GunReformNow
1943 2018-02-15 17:24:12 Now - Vote against - bump stocks; Countrywide Concealed Carry  Reciprocity; cop killer rounds; super shooter magazines; and gun sales  without completed background checks.
1944 2018-02-15 17:23:57 @dandakich 
1- ban making AR15 for sale to.public.
2- stop making magazines with more than a few rounds
3- eliminate bump stocks
4- allow every other gun to still be sold and used.
Easy simple reasonable steps
1945 2018-02-15 17:23:52 Now - Vote against - bump stocks; Countrywide Concealed Carry  Reciprocity; cop killer rounds; super shooter magazines; and gun sales  without completed background checks.
1946 2018-02-15 17:23:42 Thx!
1947 2018-02-15 17:23:42 Not a shotgun. But all of Dems talking points. Auto weapons (semi I know) bump stocks blah blah.  makes one think just saying
1948 2018-02-15 17:23:41 1) not a fascist 2) you shouldn't be able to get a gun at a show without a background check, you shouldn't be able to get a gun with a history of mental health issues, no bump stocks, no high cap magazines, no assault rifles. We will call. WE WILL VOTE. #GUNREFORMNOW
1949 2018-02-15 17:23:37 It's more than automatic guns that make the gun laws we have problematic. Have you heard of a bump stocks? You don't even need an automatic riffle for it to go off like one
1950 2018-02-15 17:23:35 won't ban bump stocks. It's little things like that that could make a difference.
1951 2018-02-15 17:23:33 Semi-automatic firearms w/detachable magazine & pistol grip, bump stocks (should just be illegal in general), flash suppressor/barrel shroud, AR-15, basically anything meant to kill human beings. You don't hunt w/a semi-automatic weapon & you don't protect yourself w/them either
1952 2018-02-15 17:23:28 That’s a step. We need Mnuchin to call for a ban on assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks—Illegal to purchase, to sell, to possess, beginning immediately.
1953 2018-02-15 17:23:25 yep, and congress and this POTUS couldn't even act on banning bump stocks after the worse mass shooting in modern US history. That damn slipper slope must be a nightmare for the NRA and it's supporters...
1954 2018-02-15 17:23:23 @rcwhalen I was pleased to hear your comments.From my field I was warning of bank stocks.
1955 2018-02-15 17:22:51 Govt has to set up cold stores where their produce can be stored for some time frame until they can get their base price. The buyers can view and buy like they buy stocks Online...but the base price should be fixed by the govt@narendramodi
1956 2018-02-15 17:22:32 I assure you, they can reclassify bump fire stocks to be subject to the NFA. That would effectively ban new sales of them.
1957 2018-02-15 17:22:28 Very well said. I add no assault weapons and no bump stocks or even semi automatic weapons. The NRA is promoting guns, normalizing assault weapons and keeping this horrible trend not only alive but PROTECTED by them.
1958 2018-02-15 17:22:27 Mental health should be an issue when getting a weapons permit but there needs to be a federal ban on military assault rifle’s no matter if they’re semi automatic or fully automatic. Bump stocks should be illegal too. I am against the gun show loop hole too!
1959 2018-02-15 17:22:25 @RepDaveBrat  Vote against - bump stocks; Countrywide Concealed Carry  Reciprocity; cop killer rounds; super shooter magazines; and gun sales  without completed background checks.

1961 2018-02-15 17:22:06 Two day waiting period, if you're on the no fly list no purchasing of a fire arm, closing the gun show loophole, no bump stocks, no assault rifes or at least none under the age of 18, no hand guns at 18, no guns for any one under FBI investigation
1962 2018-02-15 17:21:42 Bump stocks, hellfire triggers, forward grips, thumbhole stocks (not applicable to ar-15’s but still) and also high capacity magazines
1963 2018-02-15 17:21:34 Then #DOYOURJOB @SpeakerRyan @PRyan. Your #ThoughtsAndPrayersDoNothing. Ban assault rifles and bump stocks. Make #mentalhealthcare accessible and affordable to everyone. Disavow association with the @NRA. We need #GunControlNow, not more of the same which doesn't work!
1964 2018-02-15 17:21:22 $ANDI 0.0330 i do not like these large blocks! + VERT
1965 2018-02-15 17:21:19 Actually, after Vegas last year, a bipartisan group in congress supported a nationwide ban on bump-stocks. As far as I know, that went nowhere. I’d say that implies both a knowledge of the small steps that need to happen and an unwillingness to take action.
1966 2018-02-15 17:20:39 But what about gun profits?? The gun companies NEED them. So what if a bunch of people die? Their stocks would go down. Now THAT, would be a real tragedy. Bigly.
1967 2018-02-15 17:20:38 I support gun insurance for the same reason I support car insurance. Both are weapons, and there are a lot of reckless people out there. We'll still need federal regulations on bump stocks/semi-automatics/background checks/gun selling laws.
1968 2018-02-15 17:20:16 So when is the time Mrs Bill?  It wasn't the right time following Columbine. That was 18 years ago. It wasn't the right time after Sandy Hook, when 26 were killed, including 20 6 & 7 year olds. That was 6 years ago. And where's the ban on bump-stocks. It's been 4 mos since Vegas.
1969 2018-02-15 17:20:11 #CALLCONGRESS
1-Reinstate the ban on assault weapons. They're made for murdering people not deer.
2-BAN BUMP STOCKS. They just make the murdering faster.
3-Since we'll probably be focusing on mental illness again, reinstate ban on mentally ill buying weapons.
4-Weapon buy back.
1970 2018-02-15 17:20:02 #stocks  Retirees and senior investors beware of super leveraged ETFs particularly in a volatile, highly over priced stock market as we have now. There is almost no bottom to your potential losses unless money is no object.
1971 2018-02-15 17:19:57 of course many many millionaires (and a few billionaires) have been created by AAPL/FB/AMZN/GOOG/MSFT for their employees, suppliers, App developers, smaller tech startups they've acquired over the years.......as well as individual investors/funds that have owned their stocks....
1972 2018-02-15 17:19:26 The Pulse Nightclub had an armed guard. It didn't stop 49 deaths. Oh and he also used an AR15. Remember after Las Vegas we were getting rid of bump stocks full stop. Both sides agreed on that and something was going to be done. What has been done? Nothing. Not a god. damn. thing.
1973 2018-02-15 17:19:25 Magazines? They aren't calling them bump stocks this time?.....oh wait. Same gun used in Sandyhook. But on Valentine's Day? The Capone Massacre?
1974 2018-02-15 17:19:09 What about all of the terrorist attacks using vans/trucks to mow crowds down? We have car insurance because it's a lethal weapon. Why not have gun insurance? That part is pretty simple. We'll still need other measures for bump stocks/semi-automatics/background checks.
1975 2018-02-15 17:19:03 Exactly the example I was gonna reference. These assholes will take a bullet and spin mass slaughter as the "price of freedom" to protect their @NRA rating and fat campaign contributions. Gotta keep those drum clips and bump stocks flying off the shelves.
1976 2018-02-15 17:18:46 America needs a federal ban on all assault weapons including semi and fully automatic weapons and bump stocks. We also need tough mental health laws concerning people who own guns! I also support a federal law that would require all gun owners to have weapon safes.
1977 2018-02-15 17:18:44 @BlackBerry @JohnChen Being a shareholder of BlackBerry is nice: BlackBerry outperformed down markets with a 30% drop and while other tech stocks quickly recovered, BlackBerry is still struggling. Ignoring shareholders is one of the key abilities of John Chen
1978 2018-02-15 17:18:38 You can’t say that is true until common sense legislation is passed for universal background checks and assault weapons and bump stocks are banned!
1979 2018-02-15 17:18:25 And for you 2nd amendment people...almost NO ONE is talking about taking away ALL guns. But the only reason for an assault rifle and things like bump stocks is to slaughter as many human beings as possible as fast as possible. Let's start the discussion there, okay?

1982 2018-02-15 17:17:59 NRA is not trying to stop bump stocks from being banned, though again, what’s the problem with them? Do bump stocks magically float through the air, attach themselves to rifles, and cause the rifle to fire?
1983 2018-02-15 17:17:57 Accessing weapons requires Mandatory background checks, outlaw large round capacity,  guns show loop holes  and bump stocks

1987 2018-02-15 17:17:14 How will the person who stocks supplies know to get more pens if the empty box isn't left as a signal?

2003 2018-02-15 17:14:43 @SenatorTimScott No one needs AR-15s, high capacity mags, bump stocks, or guns in bars/churches/schools & we all need background checks & more funding for mental health/bully prevention. And those without blood money in their hands from NRA knows that. WE know why YOU R ignorant.
2004 2018-02-15 17:14:39 Because of the controls in place. As stocks change, the limits change.
2005 2018-02-15 17:14:14 @GrahamBlog No one needs AR-15s, high capacity mags, bump stocks, or guns in bars/churches/schools & we all need background checks & more funding for mental health/bully prevention. And those without blood money in their hands from NRA knows that. And WE know why YOU R ignorant.
2006 2018-02-15 17:14:06 I mean, I would start off by getting rid of the private sale loophole, actual strict multistep background checks, making all automatic rifles illegal instead of just ones after 1989, and banning certain attachments such as bump-stocks for semi-automatic rifles.
2007 2018-02-15 17:13:55 Haha stop, we all know the republicans and NRA are in bed with each other. How's that ban on the bump stocks going after Las vegas??
2008 2018-02-15 17:13:30 Bump stocks are practically useless, they only work well when you're not trying to aim at all precisely. You could do much more damage with slower, precise shooting. Get proficient enough, you can change mags with in no time at all.
2009 2018-02-15 17:13:21 @danpfeiffer you can hem and haw about mental health issues, background checks, bump stocks until the cows come home. But let's keep it simple. They don't call them assault rifles for no reason. Ban assault rifles. There was a 10-year ban, it was repealed and the Carnage began
2010 2018-02-15 17:13:18 Dollar land in sight
2011 2018-02-15 17:13:16 Of course we should enforce laws. We should probably also close loopholes and require mandatory universal background checks, ban bump stocks, say no guns to domestic abusers whether married or not, but generally, I advocate for studying the problem. Why is the NRA opposed to that
2012 2018-02-15 17:13:02 Having seen a number of the survivors on Twitter yesterday and today I hope and believe they will form a mass protest unless there is an immediate action to ban assault rifles, bump stocks, and to tighten gun laws and registries.  Listen to the people involved- they matter!!!!
2013 2018-02-15 17:12:49 How about gun control?  Can you pull together a bi-partisan group like this to address gun control?  Start with bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons.  Can you break free of NRA?
2014 2018-02-15 17:12:48 $ggi was a lottery $mym $get $mmj xmg as many others . More to come that's forsure . Everything takes time but most people don't like to wait . Waiting on good stocks with good fundamentals with many catalyst on its way . Is where the men and the woman make big bank
2015 2018-02-15 17:12:44 And oh please about the gun control is not the answer arguments. Have they even gotten around to banning bump stocks? Like the kind used in Vegas. Nope? Just a few liberal states trying something and that’s it.

2019 2018-02-15 17:12:14 Start with getting guns out of the hands of dangerous people, and finish with making assault weapons and bump stocks illegal.
2020 2018-02-15 17:11:59 FIRST--Vote out anyone accepting NRA money or support. SECOND: Buy back all assault weapons and bump stocks and make them illegal.
2021 2018-02-15 17:11:58 The old guns don't kill people..people kill people is 18th century.. Nukes don't  kill people? Let N Korea have all the nukes they want.. I'm a gun owner..

2026 2018-02-15 17:11:44 By always concentrating on could have been done in the latest assault, we never move forward. Given the preferred method of recent mass murderers, a ban on AR-15s and bump stocks will make the mowing down of innocent lives by future “professional school shooters” more difficult.
2027 2018-02-15 17:11:31 Yes. Breadth is good but not great. Lots of individual stocks failing at resistance. Banks/financials in particular. I traded for a quick pop off the bottom, taking my profits and getting more market neutral.
2028 2018-02-15 17:11:16 If GOP made legislation helping people who needed it in regards to mental health we'd support it; they won't even do that. We limit sudafed purchases but nobody whines about their freedom. No1 banning guns. Just get rid of some guns (AR-15 and so) limit ammo sale, no bump stocks
2029 2018-02-15 17:11:14 After the Las Vegas massacre, over 500 dead or wounded, we were gonna ban bump stocks. Even THAT didn't happen. Because guns are penises for small men, and bump stocks are dick crutches. @rudepundit
2030 2018-02-15 17:11:10 Actually that's not entirely true Dawn, (Hughes Amendment) and we both know there are plenty of ways to make already deadly weapons even more deadly with the use of high capacity magazines, and add ons like bump stocks.
2031 2018-02-15 17:11:07 Not true: 
Did mass shootings happen in 1950?
There were people in 1950 who were determined to commit evil acts. 
What's the difference?  Guns. 
I will meet gun owners halfway. No more Ar-15's, no more bump stocks or automatics.
Gun owners can have a rifle or revolver. That's it!
2032 2018-02-15 17:10:52 “See and say” is NOT ENOUGH!
Thoughts and prayers are NOT ENOUGH! 
Outlawing bump stocks is NOT ENOUGH! 
It is NOT strictly a mental health issue!
2033 2018-02-15 17:10:27 The stocks?  This is a major problem with people who know nothing about guns trying to make laws about them.
2034 2018-02-15 17:10:26 Dem talking points right on cue  next bump stocks and find it odd always an AR15. Pfft get real
2035 2018-02-15 17:10:23 You can hem and haw about  mental health issues , background checks  bump stocks  until the cows come home . They don't call them assault rifles for no reason. Let's keep it simple, ban assault rifles.
2036 2018-02-15 17:10:19 At an ABSOLUTE FUCKING MINIMUM, banning assault-style weapons and bump stocks will reduce the severity of shootings that do happen. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization

2038 2018-02-15 17:10:07 Americans won't give up guns, as evidenced by rising stocks yet again today, and Washington doesn't want an honest convo because they are getting paid by NRA blood money, which my father is a member of.

2046 2018-02-15 17:08:37 How about taking a baby step from the Vegas shooting and ban bump stocks? It wouldn't have helped with Parkland, but at least would show you are capable of acting on the simplest common sense measures.
2047 2018-02-15 17:08:29 The CHEAPEST hunting rifles are bolt-action, plenty of semis. Lightweight means higher recoil and less accurate follow up shots— the gun is still heavy though. Magazine size is definitely a factor in why it is effective. Bump-stocks should be illegal as well.
2048 2018-02-15 17:08:27 The whole country stands with them? That's really what you are going with? Then please explain the reason that so many in Congress have taken money from the NRA and you have done nothing. Nothing about the sale of automatic rifles,bump stocks. NOTHING
2049 2018-02-15 17:08:26 Stocks green, VIX green, cryptos green 

is this the goldilocks economy
2050 2018-02-15 17:08:14 @POTUS I am a conservative and fmr NRA member but even I believe it is time to ban bump stocks, assault type weapons and magazines holding more than 10 rounds. It wont prevent all mass shootings but we’ve got to try harder
2051 2018-02-15 17:08:05 "Rick Scott" did you get open carry in schools approved yet? Still got those bumps stocks on the shelf? What about those extended mags? Might as well get those silencers approved too.
I mean all that noisy killing ....so unnecessary 
2052 2018-02-15 17:07:37 At the end of his term he will not change one thing related to gun laws. The bump stocks happened in October he has had plenty of time to stop them but he hasn’t
2053 2018-02-15 17:07:33 There’s a special place in Hell for people that make a profit on gun stocks after a tragedy, but while on earth they’ll just increase their wealth for them & their families. Who really wins when we have our regular tragedies + gun control “debates”
2054 2018-02-15 17:07:28 I'm not in for politics or arguing.  We need real solutions.  Removing bump stocks may have reduced the impact of that horrific event, but it would not have stopped it. I'm all for reducing, but that can't be the end goal. So how do we as a country come together to stop this?
2055 2018-02-15 17:07:26 Not even action on bump stocks. Even when #NRA gave a token “we’re ok on bump stock change”.

2057 2018-02-15 17:07:13 and reality is who cares, because you buy and sell your stocks( which is what most do) you get slammed beacuse of it. People need to take their heads out of their asses. It's the stock market and you're a day trader. Not a secret !!
2058 2018-02-15 17:07:11 Del. Ransone, R-Westmoreland, starts Va. House floor session with speech about the Florida mass shooting and moves that the House adjourn in honor of the 17 victims. House GOP already killed bills to ban bump stocks and require universal background checks on gun sales
2059 2018-02-15 17:06:56 Sensible gun  laws. Let's start with universal backround checks. Hmmm. 85% of Americans support this. How about a gun registry? How about limiting the stocks and semi automatics to further checks?
2060 2018-02-15 17:06:33 Because some of those modifications make the weapon far more dangerous in the hands of a shooter.  High capacity magazines, bump stocks, and other accessories are a bigger issue than the flashlight.
2061 2018-02-15 17:06:31 The NEO exchange allows us to hold a greater breadth of marijuana grower stocks, particularly those that have direct business operations in the U.S. For investors, most brokers can purchase NEO-listed securities – the buy/sell process is the same as any other ETF purchase.
2062 2018-02-15 17:06:22 @BigBucksHunter @football2018 stocks either go up, go down, or sideways. As long as it'd not going down I'm holding
2063 2018-02-15 17:06:18 Prayers have not worked.  Time for laws.  Ban assault rifles, restrictions on the amount of ammunition a person can buy, background checks and bans for certain people.  Ban on bump-stocks
2064 2018-02-15 17:06:18 It department stocks Das Keyboards Last night, I was waiting for years I had to Ugh!
2065 2018-02-15 17:06:07 @SpeakerRyan 
Talk about a Loophole:  So most HS Seniors are 18.
We have laws keeping them from LEGALLY drinking a beer or gambling til they r 21, but YET it is ok for any 18 yr old to legally buy an AR-15? Really? And Bump-Stocks? What about them?
2066 2018-02-15 17:06:01 They won't care. If we can't even get rid of bump stocks then we can't do anything. The ability to be armed to the teeth sadly takes higher preference over school kids in the halls of Congress
2067 2018-02-15 17:05:57 But why haven't you put up legislation to ban bump stocks yet?
2068 2018-02-15 17:05:46 Wall Street's moment of silence before they inevitably gobble up gun-maker stocks is about as useful as Mike Pence's "thoughts and prayers". #thegreeditburns
2069 2018-02-15 17:05:37 Trump isn’t tightening them. Why didn’t he do anything about bump stocks? Nows his time. Lol can’t believe you would Blame the last president for something that happened yesterday.
2070 2018-02-15 17:05:34 Let’s not forget, a database was suppose to have been created to prevent mentally ill folks from being able 2purchase AR15’s, bump stocks & mucho ammo. @realDonaldTrump & @GOP revoked that safety net last Feb. Had that been in place, shooter may have not been able to buy AR15.
2071 2018-02-15 17:05:20 Gun stocks are prolly going to rise now cause of the shooting
2072 2018-02-15 17:04:21 Mandatory background checks, waiting periods, banning bump stocks and regulating assault rifles does not violate the constitution. But it does protect citizens. #GunControlNow
2073 2018-02-15 17:04:14 Another 1929 analogy: back than the bubble in bonds was much bigger than in stocks, debt levels after WWI similar as well.
2074 2018-02-15 17:04:00 Exactly! And such agreements have been made to conserve fish stocks and must be respected if we don't want species to be rushed to extinction. There are no 'British fish' or 'French fish' or...etc.
2075 2018-02-15 17:03:58 Bump Stocks are easier than ever to buy.  Was there ever a dumber idea?  tRUmp deserves the same fate all the lives he’s ruined are experiencing.  How do we get rid of him?  Do it now!  Congress resign unless he does!
2076 2018-02-15 17:03:32 So...??? Ban Bump Stocks, and control assault rifles more tightly. You won't though because of Gun Lobby Money right? That is the Republican line now...
2077 2018-02-15 17:03:31 You will never stop a crazy person from doing something, but by banning high powered weapons, extended magazines, bump stocks, etc. we can eliminate the ability for an individual to claim 17 lives in a matter of minutes. It's time to act and stop this madness.
2078 2018-02-15 17:03:13 Sorry dropped the semi, but still almost as harmful as automatic and do more damage then recreational guns. Wish things like bump stocks would get banned along with automatic weapons. We got close with that one but that went away too 
2079 2018-02-15 17:03:05 Anyone find it odd that stocks are up the day after a school shooting?
2080 2018-02-15 17:03:00 Then why are bump stocks currently legal? I swear we’ve learned nothing as a country. What’s changed since Sandy Hook? We look like fools to the world.
2081 2018-02-15 17:02:59 I just love it when dudes come into the store and assume I can’t lift the rolls of vinyl. Then act like they’re doing me a favor by putting it back. The store is run by women, who do you think stocks them? I

2085 2018-02-15 17:01:27 Told my dad to invest $20,000 in SQ stocks and he’s already up $3000 lol
2086 2018-02-15 17:01:09 Hey that sounds great. But also R's wouldn't even touch bump stocks, so
2087 2018-02-15 17:01:01 .@potus You can do sensible gun laws. Ban bump stocks to  start with. Then AR-15s. Then all semi-automatics.
2088 2018-02-15 17:00:49 Wall Street Instant Update; #Stocks in a back and forth session enters afternoon trading mostly higher with the DJI at 23,975 up 80, Nasdaq +50, S&P +10
2089 2018-02-15 17:00:39 Damn gun stocks about to skyrocket
2090 2018-02-15 17:00:11 #stocks  To quote Jim Cramer "So many times, people will have gigantic gains and they simply refuse to take any profits because they don’twant to incur taxes that cut into their winnings. But Wall Street is littered with the broken hearts of people who feel like this"
2091 2018-02-15 17:00:08 GunCONTROLnow. Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, big magazines, create a national database for background checks, ban convicted domestic violence offenders and known mentally ill from owning. Period. It could be done by TOMORROW if you all cared one iota about children.
2092 2018-02-15 17:00:06 Can you even talk or legislate gun control for military grade weapons, bump stocks and high-capacity clips even ONCE?
2093 2018-02-15 17:00:06 That's due to looking cool not due to functionality, capacity or effectiveness. There are many, many,  many boring guns with wooden stocks that meat or exceed ar15 chambered to 223/556
2094 2018-02-15 17:00:01 NO ONE on the left is saying get rid of all guns!!!

They are only saying - let's not have bump stocks to modify guns to fully automatic, and let's limit the mentally ill from getting them!
2095 2018-02-15 16:59:44 See, here you are contradicting yourself.

You said eliminate bump stocks but also said, and I quote, "No legislation stops this."

But that is one way legislation could help.
2096 2018-02-15 16:59:19 ...cont                                                                -Ban “assault style” weapons. Like the AR-15 & Ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks
2097 2018-02-15 16:59:06 Also, the NRA is against bump stocks and other modifiers as well.
2098 2018-02-15 16:58:46 Idk if alot of people understand that the "semi" in semi automatic is a joke, anyone with know how can modify a semi-automatic to be an automatic, (hellfire triggers, bump stocks, thunder strips) the illegalizing of full auto weapons but allowing semi is nothing but a charade.
2099 2018-02-15 16:58:45 Yet you’ve done ZERO to make them feel safe. 0 new gun restrictions. Nothing about a ban on the bump stocks that made the Vegas massacre possible. You did reverse an Obama ban on the mentally ill being able to own guns. You & the NRA are like . Nope, no reason to feel unsafe.
2100 2018-02-15 16:58:33 @nid_rockz I started having conviction in my stocks bcoz of you  You are an inspiration to a lot of people. Keep up the good work going bro. When people hate you it’s bcoz you have got something they want 
2101 2018-02-15 16:58:17 Yet you take money from the gun Lobby and keep quiet about things like Bump Stocks. You are a phony. Apparently you care more about MONEY than you care about your Constituents. Seems to be a pattern among Republicans lately.
2102 2018-02-15 16:57:53 He is what is wrong with this problem, the Devil is the NRA and he is taking orders and money from the DEVIL , not WE THE PEOPLE , we want safe streets and schools, without AR15 &BUMP STOCKS on the streets in the hands of kids and mentally impaired
2103 2018-02-15 16:57:48 Stocks briefly fell into negative territory, now back in positive territory.
2104 2018-02-15 16:57:35 Stocks giving up some gains. MBS at session highs with modest gains.
2105 2018-02-15 16:57:28 i hope ur little penny stocks shit the bed
2106 2018-02-15 16:57:27 I understand you believe that, based on the caricature of the NRA you’ve imagined. But, in actuality, they’ve been a major force in providing training, advocating for gun safety rules, seeking mental health solutions, and even pushing for the ATF to re-evaluate bump stocks.
2107 2018-02-15 16:57:16 But they need gun stocks to go up somehow
2108 2018-02-15 16:57:03 I think bump stocks are a definite, I don't know how those ever made it to market. And a ban on so called "assault rifles" is doable even if its just to see the effect it has on current gun violence.
2109 2018-02-15 16:56:53 Rewrite:  A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Semi-automatic rifles with/without Bump stocks, shall not be infringed, unless somebody accuses you of Domestic violence at some point.  --2nd Amendment

2111 2018-02-15 16:56:17 It's simple ban aaaualt weapons, license and educate gun owners, ban bump stocks, monitor large ammo purchases and require gun owner to carry insurance
2112 2018-02-15 16:56:01 Friendly reminder they didn't even bother to outlaw bump stocks after one man mowed down dozens of people in Vegas.

Our government simply does not care, nor serve, its people.

#VegasStrong #VegasShooting
2113 2018-02-15 16:55:46 Require disability papers for bump stocks? Just an idea. That’s supoosedly what they’re designed for. Could have prevented the scale of Vegas at least. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2114 2018-02-15 16:55:03 My point wasn’t that we shouldn’t have the right to bear arms, but to underline how the amendment needs modern day caveats as our forefathers couldn’t imagine regular citizens owning bump stocks and such. Amendments needs modern day reforms.
2115 2018-02-15 16:54:58 Did he obtain weapons legally or illegally? Did you use "bump stocks"? Do you want to feel good or do you want to solve the issue? You are all politics all the time.

Local school boards need to be held accountable to protect their schools. It is their responsibility.

2118 2018-02-15 16:54:26 The issue is the modifications done to turn these “hunting rifles” into mass killing machines.  No hunting rifle has any magazine capacity past 6.  No hunting rifles should be able to have bump stocks.  It’s rediculous...

2125 2018-02-15 16:53:45 Yes, bump stocks should be banned,  assault rifle is s made up term, who decides whatisa large quantity of ammo,Thereis no gunshow loophole they all havr to go through background checks, online sales still need to go through someone with ffl
2126 2018-02-15 16:53:36 I used to think that there was a middle ground. The NRA and the GOP have refused to allow that. They can't even get a law on bump stocks. What a joke the 2A has become.
2127 2018-02-15 16:53:27 Speaker Ryan,  NO to bump stocks, AR-15s. YES to background checks. NO to 22% cut to Medicaid for mental health care!YES to the AMA's recommendation for CDC to research gun violence as a PUBLIC SAFETY CRISIS.  CONGRESS DECLINED THIS! NO money from the NRA! BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS

#GOPDoesNothing
2137 2018-02-15 16:52:21 Since 4q16, trading other people's vote has been quite profitable, if you understand what "other people" said.  Trump = "you're not cutting my entitlements, & we want a weaker USD."  Buy stocks, short UST's, short USD.  The zeitgeist of the age changed...we're only 16 mths in
2138 2018-02-15 16:52:03 Like pavlov's dog or something... the blood of a mass shooting barely has dried before the stocks tick upwards in anticipation of all the paranoid "responsible" gun owners rushing to stock up for when the Obama some how comes for their guns.
2139 2018-02-15 16:51:50 How about a ban on AR-15's and bump stocks for starters? How about talking to the UK and other countries like Australia asking them how they implemented their gun laws? We could start there.

2142 2018-02-15 16:50:47 FANG stocks including $TSLA are a perfect example of these things. Stocks blown up to valuations of utterly farcical proportions, so these crooks can make more short term profit. Who cares if someone loses all their savings in a crash.....
2143 2018-02-15 16:50:43 They are all signaling QE to prop stocks, combined with Fed raising rates to slow USD’s decline into oblivion. Changing of the Guard.
2144 2018-02-15 16:50:39 Following the Las Vegas massacre, the NRA and Republicans advocated banning bump stocks. Democrats dithered and instead refused to do anything that wasn't "comprehensive" gun control reform.

That's the opposite of compromise.
2145 2018-02-15 16:50:39 Ok, fine, don't conclude anything about this mass shooting. Conclude something from the Texas church! Vegas! Bump stocks? Expanded background checks? Remember those conclusions?

2148 2018-02-15 16:50:02 Bring back the limitations on the mentally ill getting access to guns, ban assault style guns like AR-15, ban high capacity magazines, ban bump stocks, make laws like gun registry & permits at federal level.... lots we could do that don’t “take away the 2A” #guncontrolnow

2150 2018-02-15 16:49:58 Yeah absurd still not a full ban on bump stocks
2151 2018-02-15 16:49:37 171 to 120? 30% erosion? and still there is no bottom in place. The real worry is how many such stocks r in the portfolio. It is better to trade by taking advice from reliable person like you than investing in MFs.
2152 2018-02-15 16:49:21 Massachusetts passed a law banning Bump Stocks. It went into effect 2/1/18.  We can’t depend on federal govt
2153 2018-02-15 16:49:14 America had muskets in 1776, not high powered semi automatic (sometimes retro fitted with bump stocks)
2154 2018-02-15 16:48:57 Words mean nothing, they banned bump stocks but not the gun. Until guns are banned this will continue.
2155 2018-02-15 16:48:57 Middle ground is safe educated gun ownership with provisions for managing them continued education-tax them, track them, more thorough background checks and double check-don’t receive them until in national database.  Tax ammo eliminate big clips and bump stocks as a start

Feinstein's about no guns for people on the Terrorist Watch List
Or outlawing bump stocks.
Something 99.5% of Americans are for.
2161 2018-02-15 16:47:42 Bill, we couldn't even get bump stocks discussed. It's difficult to have rational conversation when some won't say anything, but thoughts and prayers, guns don't kill, and the newest-mental health.
2162 2018-02-15 16:47:42 Bump stocks are still legal.   The biggest no-brainer legislation did not pass in the House because of this hypocrite.
2163 2018-02-15 16:47:34 BTW, the Constitution CAN be amended.  Perhaps it's time, if Congress won't deal with bump stocks, assault rifles, and background checks, for the PEOPLE to rise up and repeal the 2nd Amendment.  If the NRA is smart, they will notice the rising wave.
2164 2018-02-15 16:47:30 You couldn't even get anything done with BUMP STOCKS after Vegas.  Republicans don't fight against guns since that's where the money comes from. You all have blood on your hands. And here you were all "shaken" when repub ball players were shot at. Imagine being a kid?
2165 2018-02-15 16:47:24 To the children of our country: you are not alone. Your community is filled with carriers of automatic weapons, bump stocks and magazines.
2166 2018-02-15 16:47:20 I completely stand by your right to own a gun. You have 2 hands, so 2 maximum should be sufficient.

I do not agree you need military/as many victims as possible assault rifles or bump stocks.

Why can’t that be a compromise?
2167 2018-02-15 16:47:19 Ban bump stocks!

Which are still legal.
2168 2018-02-15 16:47:19 Bump stocks???  Anything changed there???
2169 2018-02-15 16:47:10 BTW Congressman, where does you and Congress stand in terms of limiting — or even banning — the sale of Bump Stocks?
2170 2018-02-15 16:47:09 My criticism is that the projections shouldn't have been provided in the first place.
2171 2018-02-15 16:47:01 @SpeakerRyan I remember you saying you were in favor of ending the legal sale of bump stocks after the Las Vegas Shooting yet they are still legal to purchase?  Why is that?
2172 2018-02-15 16:46:55 @SpeakerRyan you talking and blaming everyone except The GOP. When is enough, enough? When are the loopholes be closed about Bump stocks?You can send all the prayer you want but until you take action your words are empty.
2173 2018-02-15 16:46:48 Please @joebiden let’s find a way to get rid of all assault rifles & bump stocks. No argument for people to have them
2174 2018-02-15 16:46:42 So sad so very few Republicans are ready to take action on gun control laws to keep AR-15 out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them.  And most don't need this assault rifle.  Sort of like bump stocks.  Shame on #GOP !!!!! Shame on #NRA !!! #GunControl
2175 2018-02-15 16:46:31 Bumper stocks, grandfathered in automatic machine guns, ya..
2176 2018-02-15 16:46:29 Let's be real if banning bump stocks is an issue how the heck can we get reasonable gun control done!!!! Let's flip the house we need to outlaw AR-15s AND lobbying from the NRA!!!!! #GunContolNow
2177 2018-02-15 16:46:16 Senator Gardner, I have a gun. That said, I am against the sales of AR-15's. I want bump stocks to be taken off the market. I want enhanced background checks. If you continue to support all of these weapons staying on the market, you are enabling the next mass killing.
2178 2018-02-15 16:46:12 Remember when GOP leaders said they would pass laws to restrict the purchase of Bump Stocks? How did they do on that?
2179 2018-02-15 16:46:10 Last shooting we were praying and talking about banning bump stocks. What will it be this time that we don't do anything about?
2180 2018-02-15 16:46:00 All politicians should return the money they take from the NRA ,STOP THE SALES OF AR15 And BUMP STOCKS
2181 2018-02-15 16:45:59 Hey @SpeakerRyan let's lay off the "knee jerk" rhetoric. I remember EVEN YOU expressed support for a ban of bump stocks after the Mandalay Bay murders.

Yet you did absolutely nothing about it it, NOTHING.

Knee jerk, puleeze.
2182 2018-02-15 16:45:55 .@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @marcorubio At least you banned bump stocks, right? Oh, wait. You haven't done a DAMN THING despite hundreds killed in mass shootings. DO SOMETHING OR GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY & LET SOMEONE ELSE DO IT.
2183 2018-02-15 16:45:45 The main criticism I'd have is the time to choose packs introduced inflation into projections which completely muddies the water when considering early retirement reductions top. 

That, and many having missing data (but a clear explanation would have solved that too).
2184 2018-02-15 16:45:37 Bump stocks - assault rifles - Why does any civilian need them??? How many children must die before .@GOP decides they don't need .@NRA blood money?
2185 2018-02-15 16:45:34 there is only one reason why congress can’t pass a law banning bump stocks: politics. that’s it. republicans only care about politics.
2186 2018-02-15 16:45:34 Well yes evil will always exist but allowing 18 year olds to legally buy an AR 15 and crazy millionaire’s can buy 30 assault rifles with bump stocks perhaps we as a nation have given evil the best tools to complete the job.
2187 2018-02-15 16:45:34 Let the people vote on gun control, on concealed carry, on bump stocks, on assault weapons, on background checks. #nra @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #GunControlNow @GOP @HouseDemocrats
2188 2018-02-15 16:45:19 That would certainly be a good start, but seeing as how we could not ban something as obvious as bump stocks after Vegas I don't even think we could even get that to pass
2189 2018-02-15 16:45:18 We can't even ban bump stocks after Las Vegas and what made me feel that something will change. My only hope is that actions will take place after @TheDemocrats took back the Congress.
2190 2018-02-15 16:45:00 @jaketapper Massachusetts banned bump stocks after Vegas attack.
2191 2018-02-15 16:44:59 BAN MULTIPLE MAG PURCHASES and BAN BUMP STOCKS
2192 2018-02-15 16:44:47 YOU WILL DO HERE THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS DONE....  NOTHING AT ALL! LIKE WITH THE BUMP STOCKS, YOU DO NOTHING AND OUR PEOPLE DIE!!!!
2193 2018-02-15 16:44:45 HEY @SpeakerRyan WHERE IS THAT BUMP STOCKS LEGISLATION??? Forget your thoughts and prayers and FREAKING DO SOMETHING!!! #LOLGOP #SPINELESS #TOOSOON
2194 2018-02-15 16:44:43 Ban Archangel stocks in exchange for FOPA machine gun repeal
2195 2018-02-15 16:44:22 @jaketapper Its not just the Bump stocks they have taken money away from health insurance that pays for mental health care. Furthermore its my understanding that in FL you can get an AR15 with no background check.
2196 2018-02-15 16:44:19 Can we agree military style weapons  be restricted to military and police only. Ban bump stocks. Is that reasonable to you
2197 2018-02-15 16:44:05 You know where there aren’t school shootings? Every other fucking civilized country. They can’t even pass a damn law against bump stocks.

#ThrowbackThursday
2200 2018-02-15 16:44:01 It doesn't really matter to the DEAD, does it? Bump stocks are sold to make semi-automatics FULL AUTOMATICS. SMH.
2201 2018-02-15 16:43:39 It's not "vituperative moralism" to point out that the GOP take millions from the NRA and does nothing to address mass shootings. They won't even outlaw bump stocks. Guns over the lives of kids. That's immoral.
2202 2018-02-15 16:43:36 Dm me
2203 2018-02-15 16:43:36 @SpeakerRyan   It's not all about Mental Health!!!  It's about GUNS!!!  It's about stricter laws being enforced. Getting rid of bump-stocks. It's about getting handguns & automatic weapons OFF THE STREETS. Let's just TRY to save kids lives, ok??
2204 2018-02-15 16:43:28 What exactly does the murder of 17 people have to do with stocks?
2205 2018-02-15 16:43:15 Giving up on all remuneration and the continued pension accrual is surely unlikely to be the best option. It is possibly an emotional decision.
2206 2018-02-15 16:43:14 AwwwwSo cute And BTW, Jim, I bought these stocks when they went up in value. But, after I bought them, they went down in value. These ones: ABC, APRN, GRUB, HTGM, PEP. Should I sell them before they continue downhill?
2207 2018-02-15 16:43:12 Doesnt matter, hope you own some gun company stocks!  You idiots boost the market every time 
2208 2018-02-15 16:43:11 Along with bump stocks
2209 2018-02-15 16:43:09 News stations saying "clip" and "assault rifle" and showing images of AR15s with bump stocks on them when it wasn't used during this tragedy. What kind of "assault rifle" was used during Columbine again? Solve the real issues here.
2210 2018-02-15 16:43:02 And yet bump stocks weren’t used in this case, or almost all other mass shootings.
2211 2018-02-15 16:42:53 At the risk of sounding insensitive, I'm going to start laughing at these school shootings. Because they all the same BS nonsense, political agenda. #guncontrol They all have the same gun, an AR-15. And now the new term, "bump stocks".
2212 2018-02-15 16:42:49 $25 billion for mental health and not a stupid wall. Can’t but a beer but can buy an AR. That’s wrong. 30 rnd magazines 100 rnd snail drums Ban them. Bump stocks? Ban them. #GunReformNow
2213 2018-02-15 16:42:43 from the man who's all for no borders carry conceal...and who refused to ban bump stocks after Las Vegas....ask Ryan how many dead kids the NRA has paid for? Give us a ballpark number-so we know what to plan for.
2214 2018-02-15 16:42:01 Me: “Siri, buy stocks”.
Siri:  “K”
2215 2018-02-15 16:41:53 @SpeakerRyan you disgust me.  NRA owns your soulless soul.  “This is not the time ....”.    Do your job. Bump stocks?  AR15s?  Assault weapons???Nothing???????
2216 2018-02-15 16:41:47 @SpeakerRyan I am listening to you and you are so full of crap.  Full facts a boy@bought an automatic weapon. If you prohibited that sale it would never have happened. You won’t even allow hearings on background checks. You refused to outlaw bump stocks. You are so full of NrA$
2217 2018-02-15 16:41:41 Well why would anyone buy stocks at the current state of the economic cycle?
2218 2018-02-15 16:41:30 Our nation would rather ban Dreamers and refugees than ban assault rifles and bump stocks. How can nations like China, Russia, Syria, take the United States seriously about human rights when we reject innocents, and our national pastime is killing each other?
2219 2018-02-15 16:41:04 Now banning bump stocks, sure..mor making them harder to get.
But as long as someone with a history of violence and threats can buy a gun, any gun, this will continue
2220 2018-02-15 16:40:54 These simple suggestions do not infringe on the 2nd amendment in any way. Banning bump stocks or high capacity magazines don’t either. No one is losing their gun or their ability to protect themselves. Now to those in the Left. Screaming for banning guns and taking
2221 2018-02-15 16:40:45 .@SenRubioPress Perhaps rethink accepting $3.3 million from the NRA so that you are not beholden to them.  

Then you can sponsor bills to bar automatic weapons & bump stocks, and reinstate regulation lifted by Trump that bars those w/disabling mental illnesses from buying guns.
2222 2018-02-15 16:40:35 MAGORDER KA NA PAUBOS NA STOCKS KO UY HAHAHAHA
2223 2018-02-15 16:40:26 Remember when they said they were open to banning bump stocks?
2224 2018-02-15 16:40:21 $SSO retests OR lows...really need some help from the market here for most stocks
2225 2018-02-15 16:40:18 Starting watching a twitch stream on investing stocks
2226 2018-02-15 16:39:55 Maybe you should read up on bump stocks before commenting.
2227 2018-02-15 16:39:31 BREAKING: Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott says he will work to make sure people with mental illness do not get guns - AP-Just like after #VegasShooting Congress was going to work to make sure "bum stocks" are no longer sold in the United States. #ParklandSchoolShooting
2228 2018-02-15 16:39:24 Every country is different. What works in Australia wouldn't work in America. But most logical people aren't asking to ban all guns. We want the mental health precautions taken. We want the bump stocks made illegal. And we want the AR-15 and other similar weapons banned.
2229 2018-02-15 16:39:09 @realDonaldTrump  "I want you to know that you are never alone and never will be. You have people who care about you, who love you, and who will do anything at all to protect you." 
EXCEPT BAN ASSAULT RIFLES OR BUMP STOCKS #ParklandFlorida #GunControlNow
2230 2018-02-15 16:39:03 @Scotus review of #CitizensUnited & Congress legislating new campaign finance laws. Venal pols afraid of
being primaried, so will not act. States can pass legis, if crt & Congress won't act... patchwork not ideal. Stop buying gun stocks & investments. And,
#VoteThemOut2018.
2231 2018-02-15 16:38:51 Dear Sir, how exchange is allowing PCJ type of stocks in F&O. They talk about investors protection etc. Blah blah.
2232 2018-02-15 16:38:43 .@seanhannity you’re an idiot. You want schools to have airport-like security? Mass shootings are happening in movie theaters, concert venues, and churches. Everywhere would need that level of security. Or- get rid of AR-15s and bump stocks. #ParklandFlorida
2233 2018-02-15 16:38:35 Just piss off man. Your laughable at best. Hate Me all u want. The stocks (bottoms)  I picked have been monsters.  I don’t get options. I’m not a paid promoter.  I buy with my own money. Go suck a 12@
2234 2018-02-15 16:38:32 45% of something better than 100% of nothing BUT many possibly see it as a penalty and opt to retire rather than work on but receive less than full benefit....
2235 2018-02-15 16:38:27 Can someone explain why we need AR-15 's and assault rifles? We dont, thats the short answer. Do we need bump stocks? No we dont. A handgun can defend you, can it not? A shotgun is great for both defending your home and hunting. Is it not?
2236 2018-02-15 16:38:05 Ok, fair point, Mr. PIE.  I was thinking strictly of allowing someone to buy stocks on the cheap during the accumulation phase.  You raise a valid point on the significant "negative" of bear market/economic downturns.
2237 2018-02-15 16:37:38 Gun restriction laws @realDonaldTrump. That is what we need. We don't need prayers. We don't need thoughts. We must take guns off the streets, starting w/ semi-autos, large clip magazines & bump-stocks along with background checks. Our children deserve better. We owe it to them!
2238 2018-02-15 16:37:37 Bump stocks are in the process of becoming illegal. You're talking about attachments that are being made everyday. The gun in itself was not automatic. It's very hard to control attachments for weapons considering they are being made everyday
2239 2018-02-15 16:37:08 Explain the $40 million the NRA has spent in past year to politicians putting assault rifles, bump stocks, and armor peircing bullets on the streets you pathetic price of crap
2240 2018-02-15 16:37:03 Our nation’s children should never need to endure another tragedy like the numerous that have occurred during the Trump Administration and yet even Bump Stocks are still legal. Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump are pushing a bill to allow suppressors to be legally sold everywhere!!!
2241 2018-02-15 16:36:52 I'm not for taking all the guns. We can't even pass something as simple as banning bump stocks. Some ones ability to be armed to the teeth sadly has more of a priority than safe schools.
2242 2018-02-15 16:36:50 Then ban assault weapons and/or bump stocks
2243 2018-02-15 16:36:45 It not to soon to stop the sell of weapons of mass destruction, and the bump stocks, the AR15 should not be on the streets of any town in The USA, it should be illegal to own one, WOULD YOU GIVE A KID A MACHINE GUN OR GRENADE ? Send lawsuits to Remington
2244 2018-02-15 16:36:37 Hell, Congress hasn't even banned bump stocks yet!
2245 2018-02-15 16:36:33 Et les menaces, pression morale du patron sur l’ado ? En gros vos stocks sont crades du coup vous rejetez la faute sur l’ancien proprio ? Désolé mais pour moi ça passe pas, et la plainte :rire:
2246 2018-02-15 16:36:32 What a bunch of losers! Probably own stocks in them as well!
2247 2018-02-15 16:36:10 Everyone needs to reach out to their representatives today and let them know they believe in gun control.  Background checks, registration, fingerprint locks, bans on bump stocks and assault weapons, etc.  Let's be heard.
2248 2018-02-15 16:35:58 Ban assault rifles and bump stocks. Stop cheaping out on school resources. That's 2. Want more..I've got a list for you
2249 2018-02-15 16:35:34 Here the #GunControlNow liberals go again, trying to take our AR-15s and bump stocks away. I need those to protect me from the government I elected which is full of republicans sponsored by the NRA!
2250 2018-02-15 16:35:34 #GunReformNow

If #thoughtsandprayers aren't  a solution, then sanctimonious tweets aren't either.

What's the solution? Repeal #2ndAmendment ? Bump stocks again?

I'm waiting.
2251 2018-02-15 16:35:24 .@AriFleischer @FoxNews... how about we talk about the OTHER 17 shootings that occurred in 2017... or Vegas... or BUMP STOCKS!
2252 2018-02-15 16:35:17 US stocks holding in the green for now but look heavy still. US 10 yr yields just off the lows now
2253 2018-02-15 16:35:05 And just a reminder Obama passed and banning pump stocks which the Las Vegas Shooter used since you want to keep playing the blame game.
2254 2018-02-15 16:35:03 You do realize you can both be right? It's one thing to say "I'm for gun control" generally. It's quite another to support a specific piece of legislation. For example, it's quite likely that a majority of people may be for banning bump stocks but against banning rifles.
2255 2018-02-15 16:35:03 Why can you not start by restricting access to semi-automatic guns to say law enforcement, military (as institutions not personal) and gun ranges? Why can you not stop the sale of bump stocks? You'd still have the right to bear arms just not those designed for mass casualties.
2256 2018-02-15 16:34:59 US stocks holding in the green for now but look heavy still. US 10 yr yields just off the lows now
2257 2018-02-15 16:34:50 What's the equivalent of MADD for responsible gun laws? How about GUARdians -- Grown-Ups against the AR-15 (and the like, such as bump stocks)? Could we have some candidates take a "Guardian" pledge? Like that kid said, it's up to the grown-ups.
2258 2018-02-15 16:34:47 With all due respect Talisman, I think you are missing something.

Regardless of whether UK is in or out of EU, why is UK government selling quotas? If I were a British fisherman I would concentrate on that. Brexit will not do anything to stocks or (probably) to quotas.
2259 2018-02-15 16:34:34 So Mr Trump @realDonaldTrump ban bump stocks, ban assault rifles, do universal background checks
2260 2018-02-15 16:34:34 Don’t post a vague quote that doesn’t even offer anything to it. He’s talking about crank triggers and bump stocks. Both of which should be banned.

2270 2018-02-15 16:33:48 While I’m someone who enjoys guns and using them for sport I totally agree that our laws about gun control are completely flawed and need to be reformed. Things like bump stocks and extended magazines need to be banned and our background checks need to be improved.
2271 2018-02-15 16:33:40 In Oct. 500 people.. repeat FIVE HUNDRED were shot FIFTY NINE died and Congress couldn't get it's shit together enough to pass a ban of fucking bump stocks what are the odds that they'll ban sales of AR-15's which sell for so much more $.  Actions=priorities.
2272 2018-02-15 16:33:35 NO, WE WANT IT TO STOP! There is no reason anyone needs an AR-15 or bump stocks. Why is it that we regulate Sudafed and not gun ammo? Why is it that in my state I can sell my gun to my neighbor and he doesn't have to register it? YES, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT GUN LAWS.
2273 2018-02-15 16:33:32 Also, as for other regulatory measures I AM in favor of, automatic weapons and bump stocks shouldn't be available to civilians, with the exception of supervised use at gun ranges. (Yes I know there are other ways to make a "bump stock" but they're impractical as hell) (5)
2274 2018-02-15 16:33:29 Bump fire stocks are a joke and should be banned. But you can’t pretend like it’s so easy to buy a gun. It isn’t. Now getting your hands on one from a parent or relative or friend? Yeah that’s easy. So where does the reform kick in there?
2275 2018-02-15 16:33:28 Don't pray for our children, keep your thoughts. Do something you fools!  AR 15s bump stocks. Gotta go!
2276 2018-02-15 16:33:12 Trump's "heartfelt" speech was very moving... but expect gun stocks to rally off the back of this very very sad news. unfortunately this is the world that we live in.

2279 2018-02-15 16:32:59 Or why not talk about what went wrong openly? It's absurd that people whose job is stock picking can't / don't talk about individual stocks
2280 2018-02-15 16:32:40 Just remember no matter if ban such bump stocks etc... the fact is that a criminal minded WILL get such.. criminals and people bent on getting such simply are not going follow some law!
2281 2018-02-15 16:32:33 They need to regulate the AR’s the way we do. Reducing clip size, certain attachments (bump stocks) so on so forth
2282 2018-02-15 16:31:52 Everyone should go look at us bank stocks eps/ share count ect back in the day. Considerably less shares plus buying back huge amounts. Secular head wind with good economy plus NIM’s being more fav. Been increasing positions. $bac $jpm $c
2283 2018-02-15 16:31:51 i also believe the NRA is working on banning bump stocks, a specific mod that allows your gun to feel more like an automatic.

our problem lies within assault weapons in general, and whether or not it is necesary to ban them.
2284 2018-02-15 16:31:51 Handguns, hunting rifles , but the strictest background checks required. Furthermore, a history of mental illness=you can’t buy a weapon, if you’re on the no-fly/terror watchlists you can’t buy a weapon.

Military style weapons (AR-15) & any mods (extended mags/bump stocks)=ban
2285 2018-02-15 16:31:44 yes i am. I have wins in SK Modified, paved Street stocks, legends and dirt street stocks...
2286 2018-02-15 16:31:38 The 3 people in this photo took millions and millions of dollars from the NRA to enable the slaughter of Americans. Why are bump stocks, ghost gun parts and semi-autos still legal? Answer = $$$$ for the corps funding the NRA who fund the Repubs.
2287 2018-02-15 16:31:19 - universal background checks
- mandatory safety training
- license renewals and inspections at intervals
- no guns for domestic abusers
- bans on bump fire stocks and high-capacity magazines

2288 2018-02-15 16:31:17 Bring back the ban on “assault” type guns. Limit the size of magazines. No bump stocks. No suppressors for civilians. Those rules would only infringe on those with bad intent, gun fetishists, criminals, irresponsible jerks. #GunControlNow @MattBevin
2289 2018-02-15 16:31:10 .@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @GOPLeader see a pattern here?  People on the Terrorist Watchlist can buy a gun. VETS with PTSD, and people with mental illnesses can buy a gun. TODDLERS in WISCONSIN can now HUNT.  Bump stocks are still legal. #FOff
2290 2018-02-15 16:31:05 Yeah sure, Congress couldn't even get rid of bump stocks after Las Vegas! Only votes by Americans will change things.
2291 2018-02-15 16:30:47 How about banning bump stocks? Assault rifles? Large quantities of ammo? How about loopholes of gun shows? Online sales? Improving Background checks? So many options #timeforchange #now #smartgunlaws @RepDarrenSoto @SenBillNelson @senmarcorubio @SenFeinstein @RepValDemings @nra
2292 2018-02-15 16:30:43 It’s not bump stocks.
It’s not magazine size.
It’s not AR-15s. 
It’s that you can get any gun easier than a drivers license. #guncontrol
2293 2018-02-15 16:30:31 Blah Blah Blah you take credit for stocks, African American unemployment,  what about the frequency of school shootings are you taking credit for that?  No because the state of your mental health is in question
2294 2018-02-15 16:30:27 You're on TV reading a well written speech from a teleprompter.  No dice.  Ban semi automatic weapons and bump stocks immediately.  No excuses for this, none.
2295 2018-02-15 16:30:27 As FLORIDA attorney general, what will you do to stop these mass killings? Make mental health treatment more accessible? Ban sale of bump stocks, military style weapons, large magazines & semiautomatic rifles which have been used to up the casualty count in mass shootings?
2296 2018-02-15 16:30:23 What if, and I"m just spit balling here, you addressed mental health AND outlawed semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks etc....
2297 2018-02-15 16:30:19 Know the spelling - definition. U r  ignoring the AR 15's role, bump stocks etc. not one fix. but banning these types of weapons is a start
2298 2018-02-15 16:30:18 RUBIO, NO to bump stocks, AR-15s. YES to background checks. YES to mental health services.  YES to the AMA's recommendation to allow the CDC to finally research gun violence as a PUBLIC SAFETY CRISIS.  CONGRESS DECLINED THIS! NO to taking money from the NRA! BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS
2299 2018-02-15 16:30:15 My bashing of the #Republicans in no way absolves the #Democrats its also on them that bump stocks are still legal that these mass shooting continue Pointing finger at the R's? That's as effective as thinking and praying. Win back #congress pass legislation do something for once
2300 2018-02-15 16:30:12 The tug of war between higher earnings (strong growth, higher inflation) and higher bond yields (strong growth, higher inflation) continues: 
10am: Wall Street sets up for five-day winning streak
11am: Stocks pare early gains, with 5th straight daily advance in jeopardy
1pm: wtfc
2301 2018-02-15 16:30:06 And where's the poll of every American suggesting they want bump stocks banned? No such poll exists
2302 2018-02-15 16:30:05 Right. Of course, gun stocks are up so far again today.
2303 2018-02-15 16:30:03 @partylocksltd stocks this
2304 2018-02-15 16:29:55 US stocks off the highs but markets are calm at present.
2305 2018-02-15 16:29:50 OK, let me rephrase - assault 'style' weapons. Or be more clear, don't let civilians own AR-15s. Or bump stocks. Or extended magazines. Am I clear now?
2306 2018-02-15 16:29:49 US stocks off the highs but markets are calm at present.
2307 2018-02-15 16:29:44 I’ll believe it when I see it 

Are bump stocks still readily available?
2308 2018-02-15 16:29:43 No, I don't think it works this way. The leverage is through index swaps and futures. It's not through owning 3x stocks which they would actually buy or sell.
2309 2018-02-15 16:28:20 They want to install all Security Systems in Scools 
They already have Stocks in this Company
Wakeup
2310 2018-02-15 16:28:03 It’s time to ban these assault weapons, along with bump stocks!  Legitimate hunters don’t use them, and we can’t let the NRA continue to hide behind the 2nd Amendment.  Let’s get action underway now, and not wait for the next massacre!
2311 2018-02-15 16:27:54 You slashed requiring mental health requirements, you're complicit.  Thoughts and prayers is not enough - ban automatic weapons and bump stocks as well as instigate tougher checks on violent offenders and those with histories of mental illness.
2312 2018-02-15 16:27:53 NRA HAS BOUGHT & PAID 4 GOV'T! Fact
ITS NOT TIL ALL STAND UP & TELL NRA TO BUGGER OFF & THEN MAKE THE LAWS NECESSARY 2 END THESE SENSELESS DEATHS! Its Obvious this Gov't & ALL Previous Gov'ts LOVE THE $$ & POWER More than PPL! 4 Gods Sake They Can't Even Get Bump Stocks Banned?!
2313 2018-02-15 16:27:29 “Automatic weapons” would’ve been a better term to use. But to act as though fully automatic weapons (or semis with bump stocks to mimic them) are not a concern is to completely disregard the worst mass shooting in US history... it was just last October after all.
2314 2018-02-15 16:27:26 We had a big selloff/adjustment given the rising rate/inflation/stocks scenario. But we bounced/short-covered 200-points on $SPX.  So if you didn't buy the lows and are buying after the bounce, why not have some protection if/when inflation/rates rise as stocks do?
2315 2018-02-15 16:27:21 And the last attempt to ban bump stocks was not just about bump stocks and instead load many of the same "assault weapon" qualifiers despite the NRA supporting a standalone ban on bump stocks.

But sure it is just the NRA that is blocking all progress 
2316 2018-02-15 16:27:19 remember when that dude in vegas killed 58 people and wounded hundreds of others LESS THAN 6 MONTHS AGO? and how bump stocks are still somehow legal federally?

fuck the @GOP

fuck the @NRA 

fuck this country's endless apathy
2317 2018-02-15 16:27:15 We had a big selloff/adjustment given the rising rate/inflation/stocks scenario. But we bounced/short-covered 200-points on $SPX.  So if you didn't buy the lows and are buying after the bounce, why not have some protection if/when inflation/rates rise as stocks do?
2318 2018-02-15 16:27:06 Oh y'all know I mess around in the stock market & whatnot and you're right.. Gun stocks are booming this morning.. unreal man smh
2319 2018-02-15 16:26:57 @realDonaldTrump great job scumbag.  
@SenMajLdr , @PRyan  how about fixing the problem!! Hey did you have any action on the bump stocks from the the Vegas shooting?? Or let me guess you were pocketed by NRA.
2320 2018-02-15 16:26:48 $SPY BLOCK TRADE [11:26:47] @ $270.01, 530,000 shares. $ES_F $SPX $SPXL $SPXS $SPXU $UPRO #stocks #investing #trading
2321 2018-02-15 16:26:34 It’s cruelly ironic that Congress has no problem addressing excessive opioid prescribing and abuse, but abhor any regulation of assault weapons, bump-stocks, or high-capacity magazines.
2322 2018-02-15 16:26:30 #tstocks  The wisdom of diversification is NOT to keep 1/4 of your portfolio in blue chip, creme de la creme stocks. While the other 3/4 of your investment is tied up in duds/losers neither paying you a dividend, nor appreciating in price. Always keep your eye fixed on quality.
2323 2018-02-15 16:26:27 
2324 2018-02-15 16:26:20 We had a big selloff/adjustment given the rising rate/inflation/stocks scenario. But we bounced/short-covered 200-points on $SPX.  So if you didn't buy the lows and are buying after the bounce, why not have some protection if/when inflation/rates rise as stocks do?
2325 2018-02-15 16:26:17 Nationally support for S.1916 would ban the use and sale of bump stocks.
2326 2018-02-15 16:26:04 Outlaw flash supressors, silencers and bump stocks.
2327 2018-02-15 16:26:03 Every one of the shooters, purchased their assault rifles, bump stocks and ammo legally- banning assault weapons from purchase or owning would have prevented these mass shootings.
2328 2018-02-15 16:26:02 "Assault rifles"...it's just a semi-auto rifle.
Also..bump stocks are just a stupid gimmick no marksman would ever use if he wants to actually hit any target. You can as well use a simple stick from a tree to have the same stupid effect.
Do you want to bad sticks too?
2329 2018-02-15 16:25:57 Dice bid size at 0.07 $THDS
2330 2018-02-15 16:25:51 Some people will still have assault rifles and bump stocks, but if you make it much harder to obtain such weapons of death.

At this point this is about logical reasoning and not your opinions.
2331 2018-02-15 16:25:50 Do you actually know how bump stocks work? Also, I'm pretty sure (may be wrong on this one, don't shoot me (no pun intended)) that there has only been one incident involving the use of a bump stock, and even that was over exaggerated
2332 2018-02-15 16:25:22 Hey papa what platform do you use to see this information.  I use Yahoo finance and it delayed.  And my trading platform graph is pathetic.
2333 2018-02-15 16:25:22 I agree he's had some solid calls, his position sizing is huge for these low float stocks so it does make an impact on SP sometimes
2334 2018-02-15 16:25:15 Innocent is ok, some are real blind. Despite being cautioned they still believe in these operators who are pumping stocks !!
2335 2018-02-15 16:25:11 Umm... have you heard of bump stocks?

Steven Paddock turned his semi-automatic into an effective fully automatic; without this, the number of killed and wounded in Las Vegas would’ve certainly been drastically lower. 

And bump fires are not really regulated.
2336 2018-02-15 16:25:02 Your approach is flawed, Talisman. Fishing is not about national control, but about fish stocks. They move about. Regardless of Brexit there will always be quotas & controls or stocks will go extinct.
2337 2018-02-15 16:25:01 No I’m not saying ban guns, I’m saying the semi-auto/automatic debate is a distraction because you can turn any semi auto into a weapon that nearly acts as an automatic. So why are we debating it? Stop making bump stocks and accessories. Any joe shmo can walk into a store.
2338 2018-02-15 16:24:59 That’s not true either. It’s much harder than you think. And it can be done to any weapon. But it’s still illegal. Reducing ammo cap I’m good with. Making bump stocks as well. But banning it changes nothing. They’ll find another way.
2339 2018-02-15 16:24:49 Auto sears and bump stocks can be legally bought for much less than the price of the gun.
2340 2018-02-15 16:24:39 AR-15 also has a lot of cool stuff that's probably priced lower because of market saturation - ACOG sights, stocks, etc.
2341 2018-02-15 16:24:30 It can prevent many of them. Let's not pretend that stricter gun laws don't work. It worked in Australia, it works in Britain. I'm not saying ban all guns, but there are things we can do. Get military weapons out of gun stores and shows. Ban bump stocks. Doing nothing is foolish.
2342 2018-02-15 16:24:01 Gun nut logic 101. Let's keep it simple: 
 - Cars are NOT designed to kill - they are transportation. 
 - Guns ARE designed to KILL. Assault-style rifles, bump-stocks, large capacity magazines, etc., are designed to kill more people faster.
2343 2018-02-15 16:24:01 I heard some asshat on NPR defending bump stocks compare them to cars "are we going to ban cars because of drunk drivers?" and he was dead serious.
2344 2018-02-15 16:23:58 It’s about a lunatic that had access to an assault rifle. Time to change the dialogue and stop protecting an amendment that was written when people used muskets to defend their homes. No one needs an AR. No one needs bump stocks. Keep your guns. Get rid of the AR’s.
2345 2018-02-15 16:23:57 Really?   Lets just take one example, bump stocks.  Vast majority of Americans support banning them.  Why haven't they been made illegal?  Theory and practice?  What does that even mean in such a case.  It is the fact that the NRA owns the GOP that we don't have the "practice".
2346 2018-02-15 16:23:53 We already put a price on children's lives when Newtown happened and the nation was sad but did nothing to prevent another one. The price was paid again when folks talked about bump stocks after Vegas, but did nothing.
2347 2018-02-15 16:23:45 vegas was only a couple months ago. too soon to talk about banning bump stocks. congress will probably need a few more bump stock massacres to talk about it again.
2348 2018-02-15 16:23:19 RUBIO, NO to bump stocks, AR-15s. YES to background checks. YES to mental health services.  YES to the AMA's recommendation to allow the CDC to finally research gun violence as a PUBLIC SAFETY CRISIS.  CONGRESS DECLINED THIS! NO to taking money from the NRA! BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS
2349 2018-02-15 16:23:13 We need gun control. Ban all private sales. Background checks in every single sale. Background checks for ammunition. Ban all military style weapons. Ban bump stocks. Buy backs for all military style weapons. #SaveOurChildren
2350 2018-02-15 16:23:10 No only automatic weapons, bump stocks, bazillion bullet magazines, silencers   Those should be banned.  I don’t hunt but a nice hunting rifle suffices for hunters and duly authorized  law enorcement@law officers and individual who have  some legitimate to own  onereason
2351 2018-02-15 16:22:55 @realDonaldTrump HOW DARE YOU! YOU signed a bill that made it easier for the mentally ill to get their hands on guns. And GOP refused to ban AR-15's and bump stocks. YOU own this, how dare you try to pass the buck!
2352 2018-02-15 16:22:53 @ElizLanders Trump has only responded to school shooting 4 times. The only plan that will work is defund the NRA, ban assault weapons like the AR, bump stocks, universal back ground checks, 1 gun a month, etc. Anything less is not a plan.
@CNN
2353 2018-02-15 16:22:44 So, Trump continues to suck at being president. Meanwhile, thoughtful people point at need to ban the sale of semi-automatic assault weapons/large capacity magazines/bump stocks/other assorted wannabe soldiers’ toys for mass killing, improve background checks & close loopholes.
2354 2018-02-15 16:22:41 Who are you, and what have you done with Piers?

Add to that ban:
Silencers, armour piercing bullets, excessively large calibre, bump stocks, automatic weapons.. 

And regulate sale of bullets the same way Codeine is regulated and tracked.
2355 2018-02-15 16:22:39 Just for the record: bump stocks are still legal because after Las Vegas -- where 58 were killed dead and 851 were injured -- the GOP Congress decided to again side with the NRA and do nothing #GunReformNow
2356 2018-02-15 16:22:34 How do you feel about bump stocks and other conversion kits?
2357 2018-02-15 16:22:23 I Wanna Put My Money Into Amazon Stocks But I’m Scared 
2358 2018-02-15 16:22:20 You have an A rating from the NRA and have recently opposed "gun control".... we as voters need more. Actual answers on where you stand on AR-15, bump stocks, background checks, etc. "Thoughts and prayers" are no longer acceptable from either side.
2359 2018-02-15 16:22:18 with this - the disclosure is, I am also investing from long time and holding some stocks in excess of 8yrs now.
and yes those are not trading misses I am carrying some but genuine bets I m holding from long time.
2360 2018-02-15 16:22:14 I’d settle for banning assault weapons from the public. I believe in the 2nd amendment but not automatic weapons, bump stocks, armor piercing bullets outside of military and law enforcement
2361 2018-02-15 16:22:10 I did my graduate degree thesis on the 1987 crash which occurred becuz 3 elements were rising together: inflation, interest rates & the stocks. Sound familiar? The Fed was BEHIND the curve then as they were going into 2000 & 2009 THOUGH we were warned (by Greenspan, GWBush, etc)
2362 2018-02-15 16:22:03 I did my graduate degree thesis on the 1987 crash which occurred becuz 3 elements were rising together: inflation, interest rates & the stocks. Sound familiar? The Fed was BEHIND the curve then as they were going into 2000 & 2009 THOUGH we were warned (by Greenspan, GWBush, etc)
2363 2018-02-15 16:22:01 If they are using them properly, what’s the issue?  Most normal people would see what the shooter did as highly illegal.  That is, his actions were illegal, not the instrument used.  Same as bump stocks in LV, or fertilizer in OKC.
2364 2018-02-15 16:22:00 Here in the UK we don’t need ‘Gun free zones’ because people can’t buy assault rifles, bump stocks and shed loads of high calibre ammunition. Your argument is inane.
2365 2018-02-15 16:21:52 Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked’ ..things were ok till bonds & stocks were rallying, first downtick in both and shallow graves are unearthed. #PNBScam #PNBFraudCase
2366 2018-02-15 16:21:52 I did my graduate degree thesis on the 1987 crash which occurred becuz 3 elements were rising together: inflation, interest rates & the stocks. Sound familiar?

2367 2018-02-15 16:21:40 Why are you conflating EU fleets with Territorial Waters.

UK Territorial Waters have fish stocks. If International quota is based on species sustainability and the UK fleet are underemployed logic says that UK fleet should be optimised to catch maximum quota within own waters.
2368 2018-02-15 16:21:34 @dmuthuk before picking Gitanjali gems I was cautious to check on FII and DII and I see LIC having 3% stake and also there was another FII has 2% stake but now there's a scam #gitanjaligems. How should be even more cautious in picking stocks? Ur thoughts....
2369 2018-02-15 16:21:27 1)allow CDC to study gun violence as a public health crisis 
2)ban bump stocks
3)universal background checks
4)Close Charleston loophole
2370 2018-02-15 16:21:19 Stocks and bonds little changed since the data so the USD rather stuck here..EURGBP selling seen in the last hour though
2371 2018-02-15 16:21:13 No one wants your guns!  I want thorough background checks, an AR-15 weapons ban, no bump stocks, restrictions on the mentally insane, no fly-no buy.  None of this effects law abiding citizens from buying guns for protection, none of it.
2372 2018-02-15 16:21:10 Stocks and bonds little changed since the data so the USD rather stuck here..EURGBP selling seen in the last hour though..
2373 2018-02-15 16:20:56 Reminder WA State peeps: There is a bill (SB-5992) approved by WA Senate to ban bump stocks in our state—it has yet to go before the House. Call your state rep to support! #Resist
2374 2018-02-15 16:20:51 Access to BIG guns which can fire hundreds of rounds in one minute.  The perfect murder weapon.  NO civilian should be allowed to have them. Outlaw semi automatics, automatics, and bump stocks NOW.
2375 2018-02-15 16:20:46 I am a hunter & have numerous guns but each one has a hunting purpose. A AR-15 is the most easily converted weapon on the market. Bump stocks & parts to convert to fully automatic weapon are available on line. No one is going to take your hunting guns away from you!
2376 2018-02-15 16:20:20 J'imagine les crises de nerfs dans la gestion des stocks de la collection :D.
2377 2018-02-15 16:20:12 That first part is actually totally false. Automatic guns are not legal. Bump stocks make it easier to manage recoil. It doesn't make the gun automatic. Please don't spread ignorance. If you make your gun automatic, you are breaking an already established law.
2378 2018-02-15 16:20:04 @donlemon @jaketapper Gov Perry keeps talking about mental health.  When you have 300 million guns out there, any person can get a gun.  We need to deuce the number of guns.  Start with Bump Stocks and AR-15.  The second amendment ensures a flint lock.
2379 2018-02-15 16:19:58 I own stocks and tweet about them too, that's besides the point
2380 2018-02-15 16:19:57 Deep Dive: These foreign stocks may benefit from U.S. infrastructure privatization
2381 2018-02-15 16:19:47 Many more SME stocks are in their ambit and has been pumped by nearly 10x. God only knows when the innocent investors will be saved
2382 2018-02-15 16:19:38 Can you defy your primary donor the NRA and discuss options for additional gun safety regulations? Nothing will solve all the incidents, but there is no need for military grade weapons to be so readily avail. They even still sell bump stocks.
2383 2018-02-15 16:19:32 I'm holding too
2384 2018-02-15 16:19:30 On a different note, this also creates more questions. The fact he's been assigned in the Northern area for long - where there's a serious issue of drug smuggling from India, & distribution among school children. And the fact they found stocks of drug in the room of a 'captain'.
2385 2018-02-15 16:19:27 im loving the #cindicator app! Make predictions on #crypto and #stocks and they reward your accuracy with real #money or #ethereum each month. I’m currently in 110th place in cryptos. Btw #cindicatorbot uses the collective results to make predictions about the markets
2386 2018-02-15 16:19:18 When it's almost turn around time fr pharma NSE wants to rejig and remove the stocks from the nifty.. am sure both of them still have decent market caps to warrant a place in the nifty..shocking
2387 2018-02-15 16:19:10 The new wave is transferring all your money into renewing stocks of corn
2388 2018-02-15 16:18:56 For those new info stocks I advise you to make a stocktwits account.  It can help with new strategies and meeting many types of investors
2389 2018-02-15 16:18:54 Taking all guns away is not an option being discussed by any law makers. Responsible gun owners are not against stricter gun laws. Responsible gun owners don’t want to own AR-15s. They don’t want to own bump stocks. They don’t want mentally ill gun owners.
2390 2018-02-15 16:18:43 you scum of the earth! No one is trying to take away your gun asshole. How about we just make common sense laws and restrict bump stocks and ar 15!
2391 2018-02-15 16:18:32 I listed several examples earlier:
Stricter background checks before purchasing a gun
Strict mental health assessments
Drug tests
Ban assault-style weapons for civilians
Outlaw bump stocks
Outlaw high capacity magazines
2392 2018-02-15 16:18:30 Totally, way more volatile than stocks
2393 2018-02-15 16:18:23 PLEASE, propose at the very least a ban on high-capacity magazines, suppressors and bump stocks. Hell, throw in a non-mandatory government buy-back to start. ANYTHING.
2394 2018-02-15 16:17:53 A hang gun is pretty much the same as a semi auto machine gun,but I agree on the age requirement and legality of bump stocks,even though you can easily make a bump stockyourself at home.
2395 2018-02-15 16:17:52 Will the NITE shares ever dry up?
2396 2018-02-15 16:17:51 Bump stocks? Assault rifles? Ammunition??  #smartgunlaws #now #timeforchange @SpeakerRyan
2397 2018-02-15 16:17:50 That's not really helpful, Mitch. Why don't you get on your knees and ask forgiveness for not doing a damn thing in restricting purchases on assault rifles. You didn't even follow through on bump stocks after Las Vegas mass shooting. RESIGN, Mr. Do Nothing.
2398 2018-02-15 16:17:45 Stocks are on a rocket ship to Mars...
2399 2018-02-15 16:17:07 Stocks flimmered, then jubbled, finally rompturing to the close
2400 2018-02-15 16:16:52 I think that there is so much $ that flows into the market on autopilot from corporate 401k plans every 2 wks into S&P index funds that except for the occasional big hiccup there is a constant need by a fund manager to buy stocks.
2401 2018-02-15 16:16:34 There are bills sitting  in the House that have been there  for a while that he won't bring to the floor. High capacity magazines, bump stocks, closing loopholes, online sales, etc etc etc
Sitting there. Just sitting there.
Our dead children don't even qualify for House to VOTE.
2402 2018-02-15 16:16:33 Bull shit.  The issue is no one outside the military needs automatic and semi automatic weapons and bump stocks, etc.  No one is attacking your home that you can’t stop with the other weapons available.  Also, if you can’t kill a deer with your normal rifle, pick another hobby.
2403 2018-02-15 16:16:28 We have regulations on guns. I agree with you on bump stocks. It's nearly impossible to acquire an automatic weapon. We have background checks, a two week waiting period. Imagine what progressives would say if the abortion industry were regulated like this.

2405 2018-02-15 16:16:11 @GregAbbott_TX As your constituent, I want common sense gun legislation now. I don’t want to take away anyone’s guns. I specifically just want bump stocks and AR-15s banned, and I think that’s reasonable. If you can’t shoot a deer without an AR-15, maybe hunting isn’t for you.
2406 2018-02-15 16:16:07 It would be dismissed because he never in that tweet said anything related to bump stocks? You making supporting the tweet and making it a hyperbole is why no discussion and progress is ever made with leftist who have no knowledge on guns.
2407 2018-02-15 16:15:42 They can make modifications. They do make modifications. Even without, that’s 45 rounds per minute. You can purchase bump stocks without a permit or a background check. What is the purpose of having that for home protection or hunting?

2411 2018-02-15 16:14:35 I have yet to hear a decent counter to a proposal that would make high-capacity magazines, bump stocks and silencers illegal. There is literally no reason (outside of inconvenience) for any civilian to have them. Limit the rounds, limit the causalities. A fair start.
2412 2018-02-15 16:14:32 If B is diluted due to compromises on it, We'll still have the same problem in x years. Past the point of half measures. Pretty sad when they couldn't even pass bill to ban bump stocks. Which just circumvents the law we had to make fully auto guns illegal.

2419 2018-02-15 16:12:56 What would be the problem banning automatic weapons and bump stocks?  I was raised in the country with guns, there's no practical use for them.  They're quasi assault rifles and shouldn't be in John Q Public's hands, too many people have died.
2420 2018-02-15 16:12:56 We’re not talking about every gun here. Let’s start at least with the bump stocks. Yes, can’t even take care of that? Congress didn’t do a thing!

2423 2018-02-15 16:12:23 Please take a harder stance on this. There needs to be background checks, banning of bump stocks, restrictions on ammunition purchases, bans on assault weapons (or at least a law relegating them to a firing range) AND mental health treatment. Take a stand for your constituents.

2426 2018-02-15 16:11:43 I would really like to understand where you draw the line for semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks. Answering the above questions would be helpful in determining what regulations you desire.
2427 2018-02-15 16:11:39 If you ban bump stocks, you don’t need to ban ar-15. They’re no more dangerous than any other rifle. They just look scary to the ignorant!

2429 2018-02-15 16:11:36 Outlaw AR-15 mods of any form. Outlaw bump stocks. Make the National gun purchasing age 25, extend the premises of background checks, and increase the security funding of schools.
2430 2018-02-15 16:11:34 Really? Let’s talk about not selling AR 15‘s, not selling bump stocks, it’s harder to adopt a dog at the Humane Society then it is to buy got now a days.
2431 2018-02-15 16:11:14 And one more question regarding this (and I know the answer, just curious about the justification). Why is the NRA making a decision on bump stocks while Congress waits? Why do they get to write legislation?
2432 2018-02-15 16:11:13 Seems like good place to take profits, not add? Not trolling, just have not had good results buying mining stocks on strength.

2439 2018-02-15 16:09:41 Well...he could stop signing anti-gun control legislation & enact meaningful #GunControlNow to eliminate semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, institute annual gun licensing, skills tests, & stop being an @NRA lickspittle...just a few ideas here. #GOPKills

2441 2018-02-15 16:09:29 bump stocks are a sacrificial lamb the NRA will legislate to distract Americans from the ease of acquiring the rifle it's meant for. background check and licensing regulation need to come a long way for real change imo

- Bar sales to people with mental health issues.
- Gun and ammo purchase limit.
- Ban on 'bump stocks'.
2446 2018-02-15 16:08:59 If you think there will be an actual legislative response to any of this, consider: Lawmakers from both parties, in the wake of the terror in Las Vegas, called for a federal ban on bump stocks. It never happened. Instead, a hodgepodge of states are taking action.
2447 2018-02-15 16:08:50 Yes. I’m okay with banning bump stocks and 100 round drums, and banning those two features doesn’t violate my #2A rights. I think bump stocks are idiotic. As for magazines, if I can’t protect my family and property with 30 rounds, I’m dead anyway.
2448 2018-02-15 16:08:33 there was a bill banning bump stocks that could have prevented Vegas. wanna guess who didn't put it up for a vote?
2449 2018-02-15 16:08:04 Ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines too!
2450 2018-02-15 16:07:35 And Bump Stocks still need to be banned! @SenateGOP @HouseGOP have completely turned their back on safety of all Americans, especially children
2451 2018-02-15 16:07:31 On top of all of that. Bump fire is doable without a stock, the bump fire stocks make it easier but jam most guns, and again, it’s a novelty rip off of what an automatic can do. It’s not automatic.
2452 2018-02-15 16:07:22 I was talking about mass shootings, in particular. I think that's the easy problem to solve: take away semi automatic assault rifles, large magazines and bump stocks. Then 17 people killed becomes 5. Las Vegas may not even happen

2466 2018-02-15 16:04:35 Sorry, the is the new tactic...condemn then do nothing. Remember when the @NRA supported banning bump stocks after the Las Vegas mass shooting? Nothing happened. Elected @NRA lobbyists killed the initiative behind the scenes.

2468 2018-02-15 16:03:45 It's also disingenuous to say that various gun control proposals would have no benefit because they wouldn't have prevented a specific event. Banning bump stocks, for example, wouldn't have helped here. It's still worth doing.
2469 2018-02-15 16:03:27 Bump stocks are legal, Charles, which erases that. Also, they were designed for a very specific purpose that makes mass shootings easier than say, a handgun. Or a revolver.

2487 2018-02-15 16:00:38 People keep saying "an AR-15 isn't an automatic rifle, it's semiautomatic" while ignoring the fact that bump stocks, which are legal, essentially turn a semiautomatic into an automatic rifle.

That the Republicans in Congress could not outlaw bump stocks after Las Vegas shows exactly where they are on this.

Guns shouldn't be this easy to buy. We need a license system. And some guns just shouldn't be sold to people

2497 2018-02-15 15:59:06 Congress couldn’t even agree to ban bump stocks, which convert semi-automatic rifles into fully automatic rifles!  Very sad for the US, and the NRA is relentlessly driving their agenda!

2520 2018-02-15 15:55:07 No... But obviously YOU enjoying this drop and not asking question are !!!   The questions I ask.. are based on what WE HAVE BEEN TOLD... and what is standard...  Check out how many stocks have GAGGED TA's.. and see how they do.  $BVTK.
2521 2018-02-15 15:54:50 And military style guns should not be sold to civilians. Or bump stocks.
2522 2018-02-15 15:54:31 No one wants your hollow thoughts and prayers. You have the ability to stop or at least slow these down but you’d rather have NRA funds instead. Ban bump stocks, ban excessive ammunition and why not ban semi-automatic weapons. So much for being Pro Life
2523 2018-02-15 15:54:19 Chipotle stocks are at an all time low, BUY NOW!!
2524 2018-02-15 15:54:15 I'm so scared that's it's gonna be busy the next few days and my stocks won't be enough. Pray that He will ease my worries
2525 2018-02-15 15:54:08 You’re not listening to the arguments then. It’s the »easy access« to guns like the AR-15, handguns, large capacity clips, bump stocks, etc. that is the problem.
Humans get angry easily. Anger clouds judgement. Angry people with guns are more likely to use them.
2526 2018-02-15 15:54:00 AAGC?
2527 2018-02-15 15:53:55 Here's a start:

Stricter background checks before purchasing a gun
Strict mental health assessments
Drug tests
Ban assault-style weapons for civilians
Outlaw bump stocks
Outlaw high capacity magazines

2530 2018-02-15 15:53:45 Out of the mouths of babes. OUR CHILDREN ARE PLEADING FOR THEIR LIVES! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT THEM CONGRESS! No bump stocks no AR-15's would be a start. NO NRA.
2531 2018-02-15 15:53:40 It's reasonable people like u who have mindset 2 come up w/solutions. I'm not against guns either our live/work space is in skanky part of LA so only reason we don't have gun= 4 large dogs. But no civilian needs AR15, no one needs bump stocks & mentally ill, no fly list =no gun.
2532 2018-02-15 15:53:25 Why not ban assault weapons? This had nothing to do with bump stocks. You can do better.
2533 2018-02-15 15:52:55 Studying your past trades is one of the most powerful thing you can do. You cant grow if you dont review your past. That is the only way you can learn is by studying your mistakes or your success. #trading #review #stocks #investing #ThursdayThoughts

2536 2018-02-15 15:52:11 The slaughter of innocent children in our schools is a stain on our nation. Heart breaking. Please support reasonable gun safety measures including accurate background checks and outlawing bump stocks.
2537 2018-02-15 15:52:06 Raise gun owner age to 21, nationwide. HAND GUNS ONLY. limit 2 per household.  Z E R O automatic, semi-auto weapons allowed to private citizens. Disallow the purchases of bump stocks.

2540 2018-02-15 15:51:46 When 58 people died in Las Vegas, there was wide agreement that bump stocks should be banned. Congress did nothing . We can not let Congress do nothing this time. Strict background checks on ALL gun sales and an assault rifle ban must be passed. #nomoreexcuses

2542 2018-02-15 15:50:56 What a about bump stocks? You are uniquely qualified to deal with NRA, sir.
2543 2018-02-15 15:50:23 It hurts that I don’t feel more outraged about the inaction on gun control after yesterday’s shooting, but that’s just the sick reality we live in now.
How’s that bump stocks ban doing by the way congress? I thought we could get rid of those after the Vegas massacre. Guess not.
2544 2018-02-15 15:49:56 Don’t you get tired or just sending thoughts and prayers?  Your constituents want action. Ban bump stocks, why do ppl need semi-automatics. We need better background checks that are universal.
2545 2018-02-15 15:49:48 $AEE should I hold or sell? Just got into stocks like week ago.
2546 2018-02-15 15:49:47 I have no desire to take away reasonable gun rights, say things that involve regulated hunting. Bump stocks should be banned. Semi-automatics should be banned. Yes, someone could acquire one somewhere or whatnot but limiting access is a rational thing to do.
2547 2018-02-15 15:49:28 Looking to invest into some stocks? I would invest into some pregnancy testing company because in a month or so their business is going to be through the roof after yesterday...just a thought.
2548 2018-02-15 15:49:25 Adam, your former boss, Harry Reid, had a solid positive rating from the NRW. Did you input into his position papers? If so, own it. Btw, it’s ok to change your position in this country. But own the change. BTW, I agree w/u on assault rifles, HC mags and bump stocks.
2549 2018-02-15 15:49:21 FS1 still wondering y ur rankings continue to plummet? U keep putting ppl like that dumbass rapper on your program. Please keep it up tho. My stocks are tripling.
2550 2018-02-15 15:48:57 Because it shot up out of the gate. Now down, and TM sold a shwack. That’s not being confident in a trade. Plus, look the the chart ... she will go back down as no news this week. Besides, I didn’t think people were allowed to blatantly say to buy stocks. Isn’t that illegal ?

2552 2018-02-15 15:48:34 @GOP & @NRA FALSELY claim Democrats want gun control laws to confiscate their guns & violate 2nd Amendment .

TRUTH:  To Democrats Gun Control Laws are GUN SAFETY LAWS.  They want to prohibit sale & ownership of bump stocks & assault weapons and ban sale of guns to mentally ill.
2553 2018-02-15 15:48:24 @VP @WhiteHouse 3) Fake Media CEO's like Iger-ABC, Zucker-CNN, Moonves-CBS,Sulzberger-NYT, Gorelick-WP/Amazon,Roberts-Cohen-NBC/Comcast have seen their stocks & bonuses go way up since 2015 @POTUS campaign start around 30 months ago & organized to attack only 1 Candidate: RICO
2554 2018-02-15 15:48:03 Guess we should feel fortunate bump stocks we not on sale the day the shooter legally bought his Ar-15.  :(
2555 2018-02-15 15:47:47 Luke, I'm referring to high capacity, automatic weapons .. 30 rounds, 45 rounds, bump stocks anything that makes it possible to mow down children... it's too much. Children are dead.. most people are not laughing.
2556 2018-02-15 15:47:36 Cool thing is, we have a well regulated militia for the common defense.
Stop using that argument. No one wants to take away your extended manhood. What we want is AR15's off the streets. Bump stocks out of circulation. Untraceables stopped from being sold.  (Yes, I have guns)

2562 2018-02-15 15:46:28 @Nifty10695Mode Hi Ma'am, how to trade stocks which are near 200 SMA ? Should I consider the stocks which marginally closed below 200 SMA ?
2563 2018-02-15 15:46:11 $SPX stocks in high liquidity
2564 2018-02-15 15:46:03 Pleased #stocks are going back up! 
2565 2018-02-15 15:45:58 I like short stocks I just think the market is solid. the trend is up. So, this is and opportunity to make money faster.
2566 2018-02-15 15:45:41 #stocks FYI  According to a recent poll 47% of U.S. corporate heads intend to use DJT's tax breaks to buy back company stock and/or declare a dividend for shareholders. 18% will bank the money. So, where's the economic growth for the U.S.?
2567 2018-02-15 15:45:23 Yes, sbb dorg usually letak stocks more than stocks yg dorg ada. Lps tu jd tk cukup, suruh tunggu 2-3 weeks. Tp Shopee still cancel la sbb dorg letak delivery time few days je  Yupp, semua ready stocks.
2568 2018-02-15 15:45:22 And in this market you could be losing money and stocks could be going insane.
2569 2018-02-15 15:45:10 It seems a safe assumption that a military weapon is designed to take a human life. No? What about the adjustments that can be made, like bump stocks?
2570 2018-02-15 15:45:01 Here’s my thing Joyce. (I’m in Bama.) - we are required to take tests to get a drivers license. We can have our licenses revoked for a number of reasons. Why can’t this be a thing for gun ownership + automatics and bump stocks not be sold? (+ background / mental health checks?)
2571 2018-02-15 15:44:55 Banning bump stocks, heftier background checks, and federal waiting periods seem like easy ways to reduce gun deaths (both mass shootings and suicides) but even that’s not gonna get off the ground
2572 2018-02-15 15:44:51 Yes, AR-15's DO maximize loss of life. So do bump stocks and access to unlimited ammunition. ALL of which are things that can be legislated to reduce loss of life.
2573 2018-02-15 15:44:49 Good morning to everyone! except those people who can tell me they can easily stomach the instant rise of publicly traded firearm stocks or the unusual prevalence of sales ads for firearm training courses on my Facebook feed HOURS after a mass shooting at a SCHOOL 
2574 2018-02-15 15:44:14 Gun control may not FIX this problem BUT it sure as hell can PREVENT people (perhaps mentally ill) from getting their hands on weapons like AR-15, silencers, bump stocks, etc. That’s a fucking start.
2575 2018-02-15 15:43:39 Unemployment has been going down steadily for the last 88 months, along with stocks. Last time I checked, tRump was only in office for 13 of those 88 months.
2576 2018-02-15 15:43:08 $SPY Days like this can make it seem too easy. So careful potentially chasing some stocks. Be selective.
2577 2018-02-15 15:43:01 There is nothing in a standard AR-15 that will turn it auto.  The Las Vegas killer bought bump-stocks which are additional, and don't typically come with the weapon.  You can stop sales on them, but hell you can find instructions on how to make one on the internet.
2578 2018-02-15 15:42:52 Yeah if only the stock market actually correlated to American prosperity but it doesn't. Btw stocks were going up during obama years to.
2579 2018-02-15 15:42:51 my mom will call me and yell at me for using her card to go shopping but she won’t yell at me for the purchases on her card at stocks at 1 am 

 a true inspiration
2580 2018-02-15 15:42:44 The assault weapons ban, bump stocks, federal background checks, allowing the government to study the question - all small actions, all well be dismissed as 'aha this technical flaw' or 'wouldn't stop that instance'
2581 2018-02-15 15:42:35 It does when it comes to legislature. Without properly defining what needs to be outlawed(bump stocks for ex) the laws would be unenforceable. I lived in California when they tried to ban "assault weapons" and it did absolutely nothing because they had to invent a classification.
2582 2018-02-15 15:42:19 guess stocks doesnt like that flattening in curve today #ES
2583 2018-02-15 15:42:14 Yeah. I get it. Got out of Crypto. Have stocks in a few things. $hmny is my biggest, but just got diluted. So it’s a hold for sure.
2584 2018-02-15 15:41:08 I just saw on Bloomberg that Ray Dalio spent $18 billion to short European stocks and now $9 billion for the FBI just doesn't seem like enough does it?
2585 2018-02-15 15:40:44 Think what ya want but unemployment is down, and the stocks are still up even with the small dip.
2586 2018-02-15 15:40:36 neither of those stocks has high short interest. In fact short interest across sector is no where where it was when these were getting destroyed. Somebody is sure as shit selling all of these names tho
2587 2018-02-15 15:40:22 @RealDonad_Trump How did you vote on the referendum that allowed those with mental issues buy guns ?
How much have you received from the NRA? 
How do you feel about bump stocks?
How do you plan to change gun control laws in our country?
2588 2018-02-15 15:40:06 Yup, I put 20g at 1.02, more at .90 (100k), then I bought more at .84, 65, 45-47. Whatever, I know what Im doing with these shares. When I free up some gains in other stocks, I am adding more $fat too.
2589 2018-02-15 15:39:58 Read: "The tiny, not-even-incremental reform the NRA might allow -- like getting rid of bump stocks or some other sacrificial lamb to satisfy the baying crowds -- wouldn't necessarily have stopped this one."

2605 2018-02-15 15:37:51 @USAGSessions OUTLAW AK15, bump stocks. NO animal hunter needs these people killers. Make it Fed offense to have one.Check registration rolls, pay those who willingly turn them in, go after those who do not. STOP sacrificing our KIDS to the NRA.
2606 2018-02-15 15:37:35 The NRA and their 2nd amendment BS, they are responsible for  this and any shooting involving assault rifles or bump stocks, they are pushing silencer laws, & dangerous stand your ground legislation. Why are we powerless against this?
2607 2018-02-15 15:37:27 True, but banning the sale and possession of AR-15 style assault weapons and bump stocks might limit the amount of carnage when these events occur.
2608 2018-02-15 15:37:21 But religious belief shouldn't be the only thing that brings one meaning, especially since it can easily be deflated by reality. Might as well diversify your meaning stocks and invest in ideas that won't suddenly collapse under the weight of evidence.
2609 2018-02-15 15:37:16 BUY STOCKS!
2610 2018-02-15 15:37:14 Mr Ryan, NO ONE needs an assault weapon to hunt or defend him/herself. We don't need to *take a breath*. We NEED people with some backbone to stand up to the NRA, tell them #enough& pass legislation banning assault weapons, bump stocks, guns shows that don't require bkgrd checks
2611 2018-02-15 15:37:00 Well Joe, the NRA did lobby against the ban on bump stocks AND they lobbied to make available to the general public guns that were intended to only be used by our military. They also give millions to politicians. Soooooo...............
2612 2018-02-15 15:36:36 When an AR-15 killed amost 60 people in Las Vegas & maimed more than 850, but Congress wouldn't even ban bump stocks, we should've known it was time to rewrite the #2ndAmendment.

2619 2018-02-15 15:35:44 “Gun stocks see a bump following mass shootings.” What if (certain) lawmakers deliberately do nothing because frequency of shootings actually fill their pockets?  just a thought.. happy Thursday
2620 2018-02-15 15:35:36 Yes, people who commit these awful #shooting have problems. The issue is that 30 round clips and bump stocks turn these problems into massacres. There is no personal defense reason for these to be legal.
2621 2018-02-15 15:35:18 No one said you shouldn’t be able to own guns but you shouldn’t be able to have bumper stocks or A.R. 15 semi automatic weapons there’s a big difference. But since you’re supported by the NRA’s big money life’s don’t matter to you

2631 2018-02-15 15:34:55 REASONABLE gun control laws would be to limit the size of an AR 15 magazine to 5 shots, ban on bump stocks, and if domestic violence perpetrators cannot own guns then neither should the mentally ill. Ban on NRA political donations!! @NancyPelosi @GOP @SenFeinstein @PattyMurray
2632 2018-02-15 15:34:39 So what you're saying is no Stealing or 3rd party purchases, no gun violence. I guess then we should work harder to make sure automatic illegal assault rifles and bump stocks are more accessible from reputable places like Dicks Sporting Goods. That'll solve the problem. 
2633 2018-02-15 15:34:18 nuances of gun regulation: (bump stocks, high cap mags, (in)effectiveness of prohibition).  So much emotion - the debate could really use some grounding in whats out there and whats possible from a regulatory perspective

2638 2018-02-15 15:33:36 funny thing is last summer I bought three of America's biggest gun stocks RGR, OLN and AOBC. After every mass shooting the stock has gone up.
2639 2018-02-15 15:33:16 5 year ban on sale of new AR-15's, no-strings bounty for surrendering an AR-15. Complete a law on bump stocks. Make the private resale of all firearms illegal without using a 3rd party broker to background check the buyer. Devote more money to the "F" of the ATF, or CDC study.
2640 2018-02-15 15:33:12 Perhaps they own gun producing stocks. Every country has its own craziness. In Germany it's the missing speed limit on highways. One could reduce co2 by min 30 pct
2641 2018-02-15 15:32:59 Something I think about alot is actual people work for gun manufacturers and that those people wake up the day after a school shooting, read about kids who've died, see their company's stocks are up, and still manage to look themselves in the mirror.

  November coming!
2644 2018-02-15 15:32:41 at lease after Vegas - Congress followed the will of the people and got together and banned Bump Stocks...right? Remember that was a no-brainer - low hanging fruit....
2645 2018-02-15 15:32:32 Agree. Did you reach out to your elected representatives to demand they ban bump stocks?
2646 2018-02-15 15:32:17 Lesson learnt from #PNBScam- PSU bank stocks are the safest bets. Your money is always safe. Even if some mega scam happens, the government will keep on infusing tax-payers money without asking the management any tough questions. Where else will you see such a largesse?
2647 2018-02-15 15:32:12 I know, right? A wall with, what it seems to me, two stocks nucleating at the north and south. Seems to be supported by InSAR too! 
2648 2018-02-15 15:31:57 pretty dumb to go from limits on bump stocks to "theyre coming for your guns," but thats how dumb the gunners are. and theyre winning.
2649 2018-02-15 15:31:51 That I point out vegan hypocrisy and bad arguments. I typically won't respond to food posts unless it is look how good these stocks are. Even then I am minor.
2650 2018-02-15 15:31:51 During the moment of silence, will @SenateGOP consider how their refusal to pass laws prohibiting the sale and ownership of bump stocks and assault weapons led to the death of  another 17 children?
2651 2018-02-15 15:31:45 #stocks  Be careful not to become too  confident that the music of a recovering bull market will go on forever. Don't forget investors who bought back into a recovering DOW in Christmas of 1929. Most never recovered their massive losses until World War II was in full force.
2652 2018-02-15 15:31:33 I’d rather throw my money at weed stocks then support this disaster.

2655 2018-02-15 15:31:01 But pistols and rifles and handguns are no different than an Ar-15. Now bump stocks, I can get behind that. But a pistol and an AR have the exact same functionality. EXACT same.

2675 2018-02-15 15:27:35 I think everyone should know how these work by now. I mean it was about 6months ago when we were given lessons on bump stocks and how they turn semi's to full auto.

2696 2018-02-15 15:25:29 GOP & POTUS have the blood of the slain students on their hands.

POTUS rev'd Obama's ban on sale of guns to mentally ill.

GOP Congress refuses to pass gun safety laws prohibiting the sale and ownership of bump stocks and assault weapons used repeatedly to commit mass murder

2698 2018-02-15 15:24:46 Genuinely curious what the proposed legislation would be? 

Stricter background checks? 
No guns that look like assault rifles? 

I think starting with a ban on large magazines and bump stocks will help. 

But at the end of the day evil/sick people will commit evil.
2699 2018-02-15 15:24:35 And its the same way automatic weapons, military style weapons, silencers, bump stocks make society a less safe place. Get rid of those things and I bet less people die. Is saving even one person worth not having all those things to you?
2700 2018-02-15 15:24:32 to shoot up a school...” and a lot of crazy shit. No one did a thing...that’s pretty easy to change. 21+, background check, 3 day wait and prohibit detachable stocks and high capacity (over 30 rd) magazines. Learn, read, study and think! Yelling is just,  stupid when you don’t a
2701 2018-02-15 15:23:39 This madness has to stop. Assault rifles,  and bump stocks, need to be banned. Background checks, & waiting periods for ALL gun purchases, need to be implemented.  Every politician who has the NRA in their pocket, needs to be voted out of office.
2702 2018-02-15 15:23:32 Frink, i was schooled on this recently myself. Im just an ignorant hunter.

I firmly believe the “clips” allowing ridiculous amounts of ammo to be shot without reloading and bumper stocks are a bigger problem.
Also, this insane “gungasm” culter we have here is a bigger problem
2703 2018-02-15 15:23:21 Overall the markets now a days are just stupid.  I'd have better luck going to the casino and putting it all on black on the roulette wheel.  So dissapointed with 2018 stocks.
2704 2018-02-15 15:23:02 Talk legitimate gun control but learn about them first. Talk about magazines or barrel sizes or bump stocks won't stop anything.

@GOP @DNC
2733 2018-02-15 15:18:09 Possibly because AR15’s weren’t available. Bump stocks weren’t available. Magazine clips that hold butt loads of bullets weren’t available. Buying guns was harder. Bad people have always been around. You can’t mandate a good heart. But u can guns that don’t belong on the street.

Did some research about "Bump fire stocks" - they should be banned?
Assault weapons - as far as my research goes, they're really simple to obtain & don't make much sense?
2737 2018-02-15 15:17:24 "Limiting bump stocks and all doesn't do shit!".

I agree it's not enough! Banning military rifles outright (like we do bombs, missiles, bazookas, nukes, and other "arms") is the only real solution, just like in Australia, Canada, UK, where they also have mental illness.

2740 2018-02-15 15:16:47 I think that’s extreme but I do like the idea of special licensing. I have to go through more paperwork work Financial licenses than I do to buy a gun. Think about that for a minute. To sell stocks and bonds I need schooling licensing

2756 2018-02-15 15:14:49 I OWN GUNS. I AM TRAINED. I WANT MORE REGS 

KIDS ARE MORE IMPORTANT! 
 I CAN WAIT A MONTH. I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE LEGALLY. I CAN USE A GUN RANGE FOR HIGH CAPACITY. I CAN INVEST IN STOCKS NOT GUNS.  END GUN SHOWS SALES!

NO MORE CHILDREN BEING KILLED!!!
2757 2018-02-15 15:14:46 @HolderStephen wading in here in a long tweet.  First gun owner, NRA member.  AR 15's should not be in the hands of general public with their precision, volume, and add bump stocks..its not a hunting sport gun in my book, their are other rifle options you can use to shoot sport
2758 2018-02-15 15:14:37 I agree on bump stocks but the definition of assault weapons needs to be more specific. It's pretty vague as it stands right now.
2759 2018-02-15 15:14:34 If you don’t check your accounts,stocks and your wallet before bed don’t tell me you’re about this money 
2760 2018-02-15 15:13:37 2/2 they deserve.  So lets fix VA before asking to go into more danger. Secondly- we've tried 20 yrs of doing it this way: school security, metal detectors. How about we try 20 years of banning semi-automatics, bump stocks and other reasonable changes 75-90% of Amer. agree w. 2/
2761 2018-02-15 15:13:23 Most of the gun hating nuts get drunk and forget about it.
The outrage about bump stocks lasted a week after the worst shooting in our history.
2762 2018-02-15 15:13:16 Bid stacking again
2763 2018-02-15 15:13:12 It wasn't cool to own AR15s with bump stocks before, either. There is plenty that can be done to make large-scale massacres more rare and less deadly.
2764 2018-02-15 15:12:15 4) Ban bump stocks, for god's sake.
2765 2018-02-15 15:12:08 @GOP are too involved with $ and power to do anything to benefit USA. They won't pass gun legis to prevent ppl on TERRORIST fly list from getting a gun, or bump stocks that turn semi-automatics into illegal automatic weapons. REMOVE THEM! #resist #indivisible @MoveOn @Shareblue
2766 2018-02-15 15:11:57 Great call @Papa_Stocks
2767 2018-02-15 15:11:52 yesterday they went out of the bonds into stocks at the peak. bananas
2768 2018-02-15 15:11:46 My point being, we need to focus on things beyond cosmetic details. Things like banning bump stocks, high capacity magazines, etc.
2769 2018-02-15 15:11:35 Gun owner: Hunter, skeet shooter, target practice, antique collector, keeping coyotes away from the hens, keeping a handgun for emergencies. Homeowners.

Gun nut: Carry to Wal-Mart, bump stocks, machine guns to shoot at cans, stockpiles, armor-piercing bullets, dead kids.
2770 2018-02-15 15:11:26 look, when stocks move lower, JPY rallies hard. I'd hate to be short JPY if the SPX hits 2600 again. (yes, I am long JPY currently)

2772 2018-02-15 15:11:03 Yes, I did, Vegas.  However, I meant that loosely when dealing with everyday situations and I will stand by those words.  My most recent comment is in response to gun stocks rising after yet another National tragedy where the pocketbook is more important than the person...

2775 2018-02-15 15:10:29 Boomers should be embarrased at what they're leaving the kids: record nonproductive debt & inequality, a massive police/war state, and an entrenched parasitic plutocracy.

Stocks are at records though, and you can get a job at the 99 cent store if you try, so it's a wash.

2780 2018-02-15 15:09:22 Count me in for demanding that Congress ACT! At the very least, ban ‘rapid firing’ guns+stocks.
2781 2018-02-15 15:08:58 Hope FM does not levy a BLT on stocks - ( Bank Loot Tax ) !

2783 2018-02-15 15:08:48 Sadly Dems block action here in MN, too. It’s about the NRA endorsement, money and the fear of loosing elections. I say take the right votes (universal background checks, banning AR-15 & bump stocks, required training, safe storage required...) #DoGoodAnyway

2785 2018-02-15 15:08:22 As long as the gun manufactures stocks go up and the campaign cash keeps flowing, there's really not a limit on the number of graves that would make them change their minds of this one.
2786 2018-02-15 15:08:15 Most common sense measure are in place. But outlawing bump stocks and keeping the insane away is all you can do honestly. I know when you see people are killed with guns the logical step is ban guns. It isn’t that simple.
2787 2018-02-15 15:08:09 It’s okay Tyree don’t worry. Financially we are at the best he country has seen in years. Your paycheck is fater and stocks are increasing. Don’t worry about anything else, money money money #sarcastictweet
2788 2018-02-15 15:08:07 Really not in the mood to hear from folks how the only thing that stands between us and tyranny is their gun rack and bump stocks. Resistance and freedom is nothing without intelligence.
2789 2018-02-15 15:07:56 yes, they can... and  the laws around bump stocks have to change... but it still doesnt change the fact that  1. most of these people should have NEVER had a firearm at all- there were loads of warning signs and 2. most of the people calling for laws dont know what a semi auto IS
2790 2018-02-15 15:07:48 Following the stocks in Wall Street, the best stocks so far are the NVDIA Corp (NVDA), Netflix ( NFLX) and Apple (AAPL)
2791 2018-02-15 15:07:01 Trump has your mind in such a pretzel that you are cheering for stocks to dip just to spite him.  Also that chart is missing another 5000 points.

2794 2018-02-15 15:06:34 What does a bump stock do then? Allow you to fire the gun as if it were fully automatic. Yeah. We need those.

I own guns. There's no need for bump stocks or full auto unless you're at war.
2795 2018-02-15 15:06:33 Bump stocks are still legal when they serve no purpose other than to replicate automatic firing.
2796 2018-02-15 15:06:27 Those are red herrings made issues by people who are driven by fear.  Bump stocks aren't actually helpful and make it hard to hit the broad side of a barn.  The most low- powered bullet is still a bullet.  And using either to kill people is already illegal.
2797 2018-02-15 15:06:14 Stocks trade higher extending recent gains.

2801 2018-02-15 15:05:05 The tweet does not say ammend, it says legislation. I own guns & have no problem with that. My problem is easy access to assault rifles, bump stocks, over size clips & other weapons designed for war is specifically for body guard type work.

Let’s make mass murder more difficult.
2802 2018-02-15 15:04:34 High capacity magazines only exist to kill. Bump stocks only exist to kill. 

THE AR-15 ONLY EXISTS TO KILL!
It is well past time and we won't accept prayers without action any longer!

2803 2018-02-15 15:04:26 Bank deposits will give you only 7-8% annual interest, whereas bank stocks will easily give 15-20% CAGR returns, with a surety of the government bailing out the PSU banks in case of NPAs / scams. It's no-brainer what option one should go for.
2804 2018-02-15 15:04:25 Mods and bump stocks make firing a gun impossible to shoot accurately. These killers take their time to shoot people. They aren't spraying with abandon. If they did they'd miss a lot less.
2805 2018-02-15 15:04:16 Stocks are 
2806 2018-02-15 15:04:03 @condor214 Yes. Today I am out. Can buy lower price on next week and more good bio stocks in the market. I am transferred to other one.
2807 2018-02-15 15:03:54 I do know the difference. I also know that M-16' and M-4's have a semiauto mode because it's more effective in certain circumstances. I would still argue that we should limit magazine capacity, expand background checks, ban assault rifles, and do something about bump stocks.
2808 2018-02-15 15:03:54 You're right. Nothing changes. Because your party goes to the mat ensuring that nothing will change. That is undeniable. Vegas. Sandy Hook. Yesterday. You ghouls won't even hear of regulating bump stocks.

2812 2018-02-15 15:03:37 How about not having access to these weapons? No other country allows these weapons to be bought, bump stocks haven’t even been banned yet, a promise made last summer, how about an executive order for THAT?
2813 2018-02-15 15:03:28 Background checks exist already, previous assault rifle ban didn’t work, bump stock ban would pass if it was limited to actual bump stocks.

2817 2018-02-15 15:02:41 Is it true that rifles with bump stocks, given an event with at least one death, causes more death than an event with a pistol? If you’re ok with just saying “oh look overall death rates from guns are even lower than from fists) then why not allow machine guns and bazookas?
2818 2018-02-15 15:02:30 How dare you! Blaming someone else, as always. Reporting to authorities? Why? Are the authorities going to do anything to solve this problem?  Are you?  Is Congress?

2829 2018-02-15 15:01:13 Do you support banning semi-automatic long guns and handguns and bump stocks?
2830 2018-02-15 15:01:10 Hunting rifles are one thing and I don’t have anything against that (except for big game poachers) but hand guns? Semi-automatic/automatic weapons? Bumps stocks?? CRAZINESS
2831 2018-02-15 15:01:08 Look you may in a very technical sense be right. But there’s something to be said for honing in on what type of weapon and/or accessories (bump stocks, which even the NRA came out supporting more regulation on after Vegas) is associated with the most destruction/death per event.
2832 2018-02-15 15:00:49 Stocks!
2833 2018-02-15 15:00:41 As much as I hate to shit on online activism and associated hashtags, the fact the bump stocks are still legal should tell you everything you need to know about how broken the politics of guns are.
2834 2018-02-15 15:00:33 Then support universal background checks.
No military style weapons.
NO bump stocks.
Restrictions for purchase on the mentally ill and domestic abusers.

2842 2018-02-15 14:58:30 Trump repealed Obamas law that said mentally  ill people cannot buy a firearm. This Florida shooter was mentally ill.   This blood is on Trumps hands.  It is on the Republican hands.  They did not stop sales of bump stocks or  semi automatic guns.
2843 2018-02-15 14:57:02 Hey @realDonaldTrump Do you really want positive news coverage? Then DO SOMETHING about GUNS & Assault Weapons & Bump Stocks! #NoMoreThoughtsAndPrayers
2844 2018-02-15 14:56:37 Congress would not even bring up Bump Stocks after 600 people were shot in Vegas.....nobody will do anything...
2845 2018-02-15 14:56:31 The legislation exists. Republicans actively block it every time it's brought before Congress because they don't want to lose wealthy donors. The NRA profits from mass murders b/c of bump stocks.

2849 2018-02-15 14:55:42 For the life of me I can’t understand why gun registration and safety courses aren’t mandatory. Guns that can be modified to be automatics have no place in the hands of consumers. Ditto bump stocks. Guns should be regulated at LEAST to the level of automobiles, and sudafed.

2852 2018-02-15 14:55:08 You know you’re being disingenuous now. With mods and bump stocks you know they are more powerful than ever. And it’s not just the ar15. It’s all assault rifles.
2853 2018-02-15 14:54:52 Assault weapons are banned. In VA, the option for universal background checks exists, a per-instance limit would be a placebo, and...you know what, fine, no bump stocks. Did I miss anything?
2854 2018-02-15 14:54:51 Who is saying that all guns should be taken away? We just want stricter laws to prevent tragedies. Like eliminating bump stocks.

2863 2018-02-15 14:53:59 MA now bans bump stocks and trigger cranks too
2864 2018-02-15 14:53:54 Remeber Republicans are in charge of the House, Senate & the White House.  They will not do anything.  The NRA owns them. They will not stop the sale of Bump stocks or semi automatic weapons.   Citizens don't need them.  They don't need them to hunt  they just dont need them.
2865 2018-02-15 14:53:52 Hence the stocks wobble
2866 2018-02-15 14:53:50 Ban all magazine-fed, semi-automatic firearms. Especially ones that are built to easily modify with bump-stocks, foregrips, etc. You'll get to keep single-shot rifles for hunting, and shotguns and revolvers to defend yourself. AR-15s and the like are designed for mass-killing.
2867 2018-02-15 14:53:32 I completely agree. No citizen needs bump stocks, no clips above 10 rounds, gun shows and flea markets must vett buyers, we are approaching anarchy. Why did the Uber driver not dial 911 when dropping off a kid at a high school with a rifle and clips??
2868 2018-02-15 14:53:25 Stop calling it an assault rifle.
That being said, has congress banned the sale of bump stocks or large capacity magazines yet?
Why not?

If you sold up, better find other stocks for the 2nd ride.
2870 2018-02-15 14:53:12 All the more reason to spend our resources on mental health services, education and GUN LAWS. Why haven't we even addressed bump stocks?!
2871 2018-02-15 14:52:54 Yes whatcha throws all accuracy out the window. Bump stocks need to be banned. No practical use imho
2872 2018-02-15 14:52:41 US stocks rise for the 5th day; within 5% of all-time high made in January. End of the world postponed, again.
2873 2018-02-15 14:52:26 But would you light a fire with a stick of dynamite? Normal, average Americans do not need bump stocks, semi automatics or any type of gun that can rapid fire. So how about a little common sense when it comes to gun laws?
2874 2018-02-15 14:52:04 That but demonizing a weapon instead of the individuals is unfairly taking the responsibility off of the people who do the horrific acts like yesterday. I’d be good with making bump stocks illegal no reason anyone needs a fully auto weapon and any YouTube videos that show how....

Let's arm teachers instead of taking AR-15's & things like bump stocks out of the hands of civilians & let's pretend we have services in place for the mentally ill that are affordable & accessible. THIS doesn't happen in other places. YOUR logic has no merit anymore. #facts
2879 2018-02-15 14:50:52 mental health requirements, background checks, and eliminate bump stocks....has to be done or clean out the Congress for those afraid of tackling this issue
2880 2018-02-15 14:50:52 “Bump stocks” are still legal. Only thing that happened to them after Vegas is that they experienced a sales surge due to talk that they’d be outlawed.
2881 2018-02-15 14:50:49 whatever happened with bump stocks?
2882 2018-02-15 14:50:46 That is 1000% a proven fact . But yes 90% of stocks . Stocks that has great fundamentals cash on hand great mgt team . Prove is in the pudding

2884 2018-02-15 14:50:32 Gun shows need vetting. Outlaw bump stocks, no clips over 10 rounds, no silencers and mentally ill no guns (Trump reverses Obama legislation on both) Wake up and call Your legislators! Block @NRA nonsense. Stop wringing hands and govern @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan
2885 2018-02-15 14:50:28 Still some value stocks that have been basing for years, looking like *may* finally take -off soon?

2888 2018-02-15 14:49:47 Today, those in Congress who took money from @NRA should:

Give it back
Ban assault rifles
Ban bump stocks
Attend the funerals
Tell @realDonaldTrump
to fuck off for making it easier for the mentally ill to get guns
Oh, and implement those russian sanctions

Peace,

America
2889 2018-02-15 14:49:44 Making stocks great again!
2890 2018-02-15 14:49:19 Just be careful, $SPY / $SPX still might do a retracement back to 270/2700 before moving further up from here. Don't load the boat yet  #market #trading #stocks #options
2891 2018-02-15 14:49:13 In a military assault these rifles are NOT used. I don't know anybody that has a Bump Stocks. And you are delusional if you think that isn't part if the plan .
2892 2018-02-15 14:49:07 Some say the bank does not want you to invest in risky assets with “their” money, but then again I come from a country where banks encouraged people to invest in subprimes, or their own preferent stocks knowing they were cooking their accounting books, so 
2893 2018-02-15 14:48:52 Maybe she did but if she still knew what stocks her funds consisted of, it’s still a conflict of interest that she should’ve divested herself from. 1/2
2894 2018-02-15 14:48:49 Has enough time passed to ban bump stocks yet?
2895 2018-02-15 14:48:48 Maybe Fox and Friends could say pushing high capacity mags and bump stocks would boost POTUS approval ratings?
2896 2018-02-15 14:48:47 NRA won't even discuss bump stocks!
2897 2018-02-15 14:48:38 Exactly! We don't need semi automatics, bump stocks etc. no one "needs" those things at all.
2898 2018-02-15 14:48:17 Still pumping the hell out of $AAPL and FANG stocks $QQQ
2899 2018-02-15 14:48:09 The #inflation narrative is the #Fed raising rates aggressively to stop accelerating infl: this should hurt #stocks (less growth/higher rates). Stocks rallying then is either stocks believe growth & infl already beyond Fed's control or stocks are challenging #Powell to speak up
2900 2018-02-15 14:47:47 @GES_Forex same stocks #caplipoint and #maithanalloys pls
2901 2018-02-15 14:47:39 Yes, Republicans and the NRA absolutely believe this. That is why they promote policies that codify this preference into law. Not only do they think guns are more important than people, they think bump stocks are too.

Take your "thoughts and prayers" and shove them.
2902 2018-02-15 14:47:35 Republicans won't do the right thing.  The NRA owns them. They would rather see children die than pass bills that would stop bump stocks and semi automatic weapons from being sold. Nobody needs them but soldiers. Hunters dont need them.
2903 2018-02-15 14:47:33 So, IMO. Stocks should indicate how we are doing, not what. A bunch of people can get together and create financial crisis on a whim. The floor looks like a bunch of tweakers on Saturday night.
2904 2018-02-15 14:47:25 nice shot  @heeels
2905 2018-02-15 14:47:10 They are still working on bump stocks.....
2906 2018-02-15 14:47:02 A double of my usual 1% allocation for individual stocks. I got on this ride pretty early and had traded it before. Still favor up longer term.
2907 2018-02-15 14:46:59 The fact that I can in a week or two time via online retailers buy  and get 100 round drum magazines, a bump stock, a rifle and ammo for a mass shooting is stupid. That needs to be stopped. There is no practical need for 100 round magazines and bump stocks.
2908 2018-02-15 14:46:11 Ban bump stocks, high round ammo, assault/assault style weapons.
Require background checks with no guns allowed for those with mental illness.
This won’t stop all gun violence but it’s a start. 
This is what could be done.
2909 2018-02-15 14:45:54 I don't think most people want all guns taken away. We want the guns that can be modified to shoot rapidly and cause the most damage banned. We want bump stocks banned. I understand people have the right to have guns. How about a compromise?
2910 2018-02-15 14:45:50 Catie's stocks never lose money because she always researches them first. How dare I submit a low bid.

2913 2018-02-15 14:45:41 @SpeakerRyan So Mr. Speaker, you are pro-mass shootings? Pro assault rifles? Pro bump stocks?I prefer reasonable, smart gun laws. Now is the time. #TimeForChange
2914 2018-02-15 14:45:30 Putting regulations on high powered assault rifles and bump stocks isn’t the same thing as taking your guns away. Good to know where your priorities are.
2915 2018-02-15 14:45:20 Interesting take - wouldn't "stocks" be the same Type A asset based on your arguments though?

IHMO, the "without money" value of these things is the concept of a public ledger & 3rd party trust system...but like most things (including gold) money is what *really* makes it work.
2916 2018-02-15 14:45:13 The jails are already over-crowded, and yet the tools of mass destruction remain so easily obtained. Bump stocks too.

2918 2018-02-15 14:45:00 Is it time yet to talk about banning bump stocks after Las Vegas?
2919 2018-02-15 14:44:59 Oh & let me remind you guys, the Las Vegas shooter used a “bump stock” modification which allows a semi automatic weapon to mimic an (illegal) automatic weapon & after 58 dead, 851 injured & 4 months, bump stocks are still legal under existing federal regulation
2920 2018-02-15 14:44:57 Whether its bitcoin or stocks, pro investors will always invest for the long term and see gains over time by compounding and increasing their investment.
2921 2018-02-15 14:44:51 The right to arms never meant the right to an AR-15 with massive clips of ammo. Bump stocks and these weapons should be outlawed. I am gun owner. A proud one. But we don't need to be able to buy EVERY KIND OF GUN.
2922 2018-02-15 14:44:40 Ok Banked $AAPL at 50 hit will let this build if we go by I am long again we have time to work chart $SPY basing under 50 let it build. #trade #stocks

2924 2018-02-15 14:44:33 stocks are ripping higher this morning, Nas nearly back to 7,200 etc
2925 2018-02-15 14:44:31 Here's the real problem: Image. The AR is the one used in movies. It has a visible pistol grip which gives it a "military" look. There are much more powerful semi automatic rifles with wooden stocks that nobody pays attention to because they don't have that pop culture appeal.
2926 2018-02-15 14:44:30 OK home run on $AAPL as 50 is in play $SPY gap to 50 as res back fill to 271 tested now a long will be in play if we go by looks good. #stocks #trade
2927 2018-02-15 14:44:27 Bump stocks change that and they are legal in a lot of states.
2928 2018-02-15 14:44:12 Stocks of stone, diamonds sir. It would have some value already mentioned in suppliers invoice. They could just pull out the stock from system and valuation as it is. Shouldn’t even take 5 hours.
2929 2018-02-15 14:44:04 As evidenced by bump stocks... I am sickened by all of the killings followed by arguing over terminology. It's a public place (or school) not a killing field.
2930 2018-02-15 14:44:04 @PRyan The USA is the ONLY country that these type of mass shootings happen in. Civilians should NOT own assault rifles or bump stocks. No one said we wanted to take ALL your guns. Hopefully someone close to u won't lose their life before u take action.
2931 2018-02-15 14:43:57 What makes this time any different? Where is the ban on #Bump Stocks ? No politicians should be able to take these #donations as they have been doing!!
2932 2018-02-15 14:43:53 I agree with Judd Apatow, your a coward because you continue to support and praise the NRA.  Nothing happened to bump stocks legislation after Las Vegas.  Be a real President and support GUN CONTROL.
2933 2018-02-15 14:43:52 Diversify into stocks for a retirement fund

2934 2018-02-15 14:43:51 I got into buying stocks, what have I done...
2935 2018-02-15 14:43:49 And today, in Gun Retail Stores across the nation, Weapons and Ammo sales are UP. And stocks up. As ........after every massacre.
2936 2018-02-15 14:43:34 Remember the last sad tragedy? We were going to talk about banning bump stocks? No?
2937 2018-02-15 14:43:18 The $ is telling both stocks and bonds they are screwed, they just don't know it yet.
2938 2018-02-15 14:43:17 Why don’t you use the 4 million NRA money,Tillis, & do something meaningful to stop the killing?? Suggestions: no assault rifles to civilians; no bump stocks; sensible gun laws; waiting periods for background checks; no sales to mentally impaired. There’s more & NO we can’t wait
2939 2018-02-15 14:43:09 You can make our people & children safer by helping the @GOP  & @realDonaldTrump make sensible gun regulations. Bump stocks, military style weapons, large magazines & semiautomatic weapons which all increase the # of innocent victims should be banned. Is this threat on your radar
2940 2018-02-15 14:43:04 'do something' has been defined many times in many ways, from total ban to tightened background checks to eliminate bump stocks. Can't write treatise on Twitter even w/ 280. Those who continue to resist common sense measures will truly be to blame when 'rights' are infringed.
2941 2018-02-15 14:42:59 YOU:

1)Blocked background checks for mental illness
2)Removed rules against "active fugitives" buying guns
3)Failed to ban bump stocks
4)Made it easier to buy silencers, and
5)Easier to carry concealed weapons
6)Stopped effort to study gun violence

Blood is on YOUR hands.

2944 2018-02-15 14:42:45 Maybe you're right, but I've seen a lot of people on the left who have been challenged on the stances of arming themselves on the grounds they've been manipulated by arms production companies (look at weapons stocks after a shooting). A number have made very lackluster arguments
2945 2018-02-15 14:42:41 We’re only open 1 session this week; 4pm - 8pm this evening, as we’re off to our West Rd Tap takeover at the weekend. So tonight we’ll have Crowstone and Two Tree Island on cask at £2 a pint as we use up stocks...
2946 2018-02-15 14:42:30 what good are prayers and thoughts..stop taking checks from the nra and DO SOMETHING about semi autos and bump stocks..BAN them first..then move on to getting TIGHTER restrictions..the wall is NOT needed for this
2947 2018-02-15 14:42:29 Lower low within days/weeks, then up to a new record high this summer, ~3000+, then the crash in the Fall or shortly thereafter where we fall 20-40%. Fed reverses courses, stocks soar to a blowoff top ~4k in 2020/21, then collapse. IMHO.
2948 2018-02-15 14:42:18 How about we honor them by banning assault rifles and Bump stocks and passing a law requiring a license to purchase and use guns in all 50 states? #DoSomething
2949 2018-02-15 14:42:06 1) Tell that to families of the victims in Parkland, Las Vegas, Orlando, etc.
2) Why does anyone need to fire 30, 60 or 100 rounds at once?
3) Besides the military, who do you know of that needs an AR-15 to hunt?
4) Ban bump stocks, enhanced background checks, outlaw AR-15s, etc.
2950 2018-02-15 14:41:55 Nothing! Remember bump stocks?!?
2951 2018-02-15 14:41:36 No bump stocks. No Countrywide Concealed Carry Reciprocity. No cop killer rounds. No super shooter magazines. No sales without completed background checks.  SANITY!
2952 2018-02-15 14:41:22 The GOP will NEVER allow action. For pete's sake-rather than banning bump stocks they have bills to legalize silencers & sawed off shot guns. They want us to be afraid. Maybe a CNN poll on how many dead children it will take to be a deal breaker for GOP voters?
2953 2018-02-15 14:41:18 Stop sitting on your hands and make immediate legislation! No Bump stocks, no clips over 10 rounds, Gun shows and flea markets must vett gun buyers, all gun sales 3 day cooling off before delivery! @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @GOPSenate @GOPHouse

2959 2018-02-15 14:40:22 If it's long only then it's not a 'real' momentum fund. The term 'momentum' in stocks comes from the Mark Carhart research published in 1997 which constructs a long/short portfolio. It seems Vanguard is bullshitting investors, again.

2962 2018-02-15 14:39:58 In stocks markets, most participants remain busy in riding the temporary growth phase while sustainable wealth is created by owning quality companies with a sustainable long-term growth phase for a long period of time.
2963 2018-02-15 14:39:57 Stop everything until you get a vote on the floor:

Universal background checks
Mental health assessments
Mandatory safety courses
Bump stocks illegal
Gun show/private sale bg checks
5 round max mags
No more semi auto weapons

It will fail, but let’s get these bastards on record.
2964 2018-02-15 14:39:25 Should have been enough time to talk banning bump stocks
2965 2018-02-15 14:39:16 Options aren't stocks. Options are already leveraged, and then you can buy options with leverage. 1 option contract controls 100 shares. A 10x leveraged option contract is a shitload of volatility, you moron.
2966 2018-02-15 14:38:59 A nineteen year old purchased a semi automatic legally. Is there anything that bothers you about that? You have to be 21 to purchase cigarettes but at 19 you can buy a semi automatic. Raise the age limit, get rid of semi automatic and bump stocks.
2967 2018-02-15 14:38:58 Democrats talk about what “we” need to do keep guns out of the hands of the mentally unstable and that “we” need to legislate to stop the sale of assault rifles, bump stocks, and other kill multipliers.

“We” aren’t the problem.

REPUBLICANS are the problem.

Just republicans.
2968 2018-02-15 14:38:24 Also report folks that are obsessed with assault type weapons and that have ordered Bump Stocks to convert these weapons to fully automatic. Congress and POTUS refused to speak to this gun insanity even when 58 innocent people were killed in 11 minutes in Las Vegas.
2969 2018-02-15 14:38:11 Um maybe I'm misinformed but I can't find any info that states assault weapons are banned. The ban Clinton had expired in 2004. Attempts to renew have failed. They also havnt banned bump stocks or high cap magazines.
2970 2018-02-15 14:37:55 There is no principal behind bump stocks. They are intended to make killing machines. Why is this necessary for the average citizen? It's not.
2971 2018-02-15 14:37:53 There is something about the exact stocks u really like.See Walmart.U found it by ur winnowing and there it was.GOOD.
2972 2018-02-15 14:36:48 Maybe it is...guess we're gonna find out.  Although watching long UST rates rise & USD not really get bid as US stocks crashed last week suggests people may not be putting much value in US rule of law as USD reserve status wanes...

2976 2018-02-15 14:35:36 Imo, part of the problem is believing full auto is necessary. 

All the ingenious loopholes to make a semi go full, like the bump stocks, just seem like half measures for a rush with full auto fire. 

Full auto, lessens combat effectiveness, cause quantity replaces accuracy, imo.
2977 2018-02-15 14:35:26 How about someone on the NYSE talk to someone at Fox and Friends about saying how pushing legislation on high capacity magazines and bump stocks would make POTUS look good.
2978 2018-02-15 14:35:20 “Wait, wait, waaaaaaaaaiiiiiit....Ok, NOW! Everyone buy gun stocks and make them all richer!”

2982 2018-02-15 14:34:56 I can understand they feel they have the right to a gun. People do rely on them for hunting and protection but semi-automatics? Bump stocks? There's got to be reform for this to stop.
2983 2018-02-15 14:34:54 @yiweizhang appreciate u taking your valuable time n give advice. I’m doing well with stocks I don’t want the options to take me down 
2984 2018-02-15 14:34:41 Then do something!  Support background checks, ban bump stocks, ban war rifles, ban high capacity magazines and ban gun show background free purchases.  All I need is a 30-30 to hunt.  I've gone through the tedious process to get a rifle in Connecticut and was happy to do it.
2985 2018-02-15 14:34:35 At every single doorway, of every school? Most public schools are already massively underfunded. FAR better to BAN bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15.
2986 2018-02-15 14:34:19 Guns turn problems into massacres with access to rifles that have 30 round clips and bump stocks.
2987 2018-02-15 14:33:47 Here are 3 things that can be done immediately:
1) reinstate the legislation so that people with mental health issues can’t buy guns
2) make it illegal to purchase auto/semi automatic/bump stocks
3) comprehensive background checks

DO IT!!!

2989 2018-02-15 14:33:35 Agreed. But Tasmac has screwed alcohol industry in TN. Very limited stocks with only few brands. Must've received money from these brands
2990 2018-02-15 14:33:35 I’d like to know what constitutes reasonable gun control that isn’t already in place that would’ve prevented this? 
And I agree w/u re bump stocks. I think there’s really no place for them & congress should’ve done something about it since Vegas.
2991 2018-02-15 14:33:32 Sensible gun control isn’t a bad thing. Shooting guns at the range is fun when done responsibly. A gun for home defense can save your life. But we don’t need suppressors, 100 round drum magazine, and bump stocks. These are not things a person needs in a home invasion, or hunting.
2992 2018-02-15 14:33:26 It is not the guns but the mentally ill individuals, capable of getting their hands on the gun.  I understand banning bump stocks and AR 15 but liberals go to far blaming the weapon not the person. Stop crying wolf and get to work on reforming screening not dictating our lives
2993 2018-02-15 14:33:12 The problem is alot of people are down on multiple stocks . They didn't see the correction. Now want others to fail like they have . $Fat is real can't stress enough. They are doing everything right . Share price sucks I agree. Shoet term pain with long term gaines

2997 2018-02-15 14:32:34 1) ban assault weapons
2) ban bump stocks
3) mandatory background checks on ALL gun sales #guncontrolnow
2998 2018-02-15 14:32:31 Hi Andy, While we can appreciate that this was inconvenient, unfortunately, much like any other retail environment, we're only able to sell what stocks we have.
2999 2018-02-15 14:32:23 Yeah @realDonaldTrump that will help a whole lot to end school shootings. How about signing a *Presidential Proclamation* to end selling of assault weapons& bump stocks. End gun shows that require no background checks. Do something CONSTRUCTIVE! #yourproclamationisawasteofpaper

3001 2018-02-15 14:32:17 America today, NYSE has moment of silence for those murdered in Florida while investors bid up gun stocks in anticipation of increased gun sales.
3002 2018-02-15 14:32:15 Most members I know think the NRA has capitulated too much (bump stocks, etc.) Many are leaving and joining @GunOwners because they are staunch defenders of #2A
3003 2018-02-15 14:31:47 We've already endured 18 Days we hoped would never come.
Enough, take action. Still haven't made bump stocks illegal! Why?
3004 2018-02-15 14:31:40 That's not what I was saying. I absolutely agree that there need to be some serious gun restrictions passed. Assault rifles, bump stocks, high capacity magazines don't belong in the public. But our nation's mental health has been neglected & it's disingenuous....
3005 2018-02-15 14:30:59 It's telling us that stocks are headed for newer highs.
3006 2018-02-15 14:30:54 ...and the gun stocks rallied.
3007 2018-02-15 14:30:31 Or perhaps a restriction on Semi Automatic AR-15's....
Or Bump Stocks...
Or Real Background Checks...
Or Gun industry money in politics...
Or Politicians who refuse to do anything...
3008 2018-02-15 14:30:30 Reinstate #AssaultWeaponsBan now! Include bump stocks, magazines & all other “accessories” of mass destruction. We know what to do—push for it. Do not let up this time!
3009 2018-02-15 14:30:15 It's false to think we can't have gun control and support the second amendment. Bump stocks, nothing done, Sandy hook, limiting ammo in clips, nothing done. The sad thing we can rant over kneeling when your expressing your right but we can't talk about guns
3010 2018-02-15 14:30:07 He was reported. That solved the problem, oh no it didn’t. Banning those weapons and large capacity magazines and bump stocks would be a start.
3011 2018-02-15 14:29:53 After 100s killed/over 500 injured, this @GOP Congress couldn't pass legis. making bump stocks illegal, we think they & @realDonaldTrump will do anything now? @TheDemocrats step up, put faces 2 the dead, tell THEIR stories, show our traumitized kids. We need 2 SEE the damage done
3012 2018-02-15 14:29:21 People who couldn't buy stocks in the recent crash got another opportunity to buy there favourite stocks at discount..u may get more discount tomorrow as well..but don't miss the train before its too late..next rally about to start soon #bse #NSE #Nifty #sensex #Stockstowatch
3013 2018-02-15 14:29:11 Correlation of higher interest rates triggering stock sell-off changed yesterday. CPI and PPI data revealed #inflation is increasing even faster than rates, therefore REAL rates are still negative far into curve. This boosted #gold , stocks, perhaps #bitcoin. Watch real rates.
3014 2018-02-15 14:28:56 You know. If you would push for banning assault weapons, bump stocks and mandatory background checks your approval would go up.
3015 2018-02-15 14:28:50 People actually check on stocks after CHILDREN get murdered?
America is one big Sycophantic person. They know the problem can get fixed. It's just that what about the money? America loves it's money and power more than their own children and morality.

3022 2018-02-15 14:27:48 Start here.
Ban bump stocks.
Ban high round cartridges.
Ban assault or assault style weapons.
Require comprehensive background checks and keep people with mental illness from buying guns.

These four steps won’t stop all gun violence but it’s a start and we need a start.

3024 2018-02-15 14:27:21 2/ on mainly Republicans, beginning with reasonable regulation that limits sales of high target assault rifles and bump stocks (Las Vegas!), is not a radical left wing notion. And yes, we need to address mental illness, too.
3025 2018-02-15 14:27:06 How about bringing Curbelo-Moulton, the bipartisan legislation addressing bump stocks, to the floor for a vote?
3026 2018-02-15 14:26:37 What needs to happen is the NRA needs to come to grips with the semi assault weapons are wrong for regular civilians that have and bump stocks and anything else that promotes killing other people
3027 2018-02-15 14:26:32 Go on TV & speak on what legislation will be brought on the floor Today to combat this gun issue like bump stocks & mentally ill people being able to purchases assault weapons. Stop the legislation on silencers. 18 school shootings. Parkland FL 17 lives lost & 20 injured.
3028 2018-02-15 14:26:28 The math doesnt work under 'normal operations'. The 'authorities' will force the banks and pension funds to buy treasuries (aka financial repression) but rising rates will hamper economy and stock market. Then where do investors put money? Gold and gold stocks are attractive-NOW

A poem should be idiosyncratic
As the traveler of firings.
3030 2018-02-15 14:26:11 So who do they want?
A GOP who will defend the NRA and refuse to pass laws prohibiting the sale of bump stocks and assault weapons?
3031 2018-02-15 14:26:02 After a majority of mass-shootings, gun stocks will rise.  Americans want to be able to protect themselves

3038 2018-02-15 14:24:52 Not like most. I think we should make bump stocks illegal, mental test of some sort for purchasing firearms, or more test in general. But i think banning guns will just make it a black market or more violent. Pistols should be made harder to get since they kill the most people
3039 2018-02-15 14:24:44 No it doesn’t.  Your side just offers thoughts and prayers and then put their head in the sand until the next big thing happens.  Remember bump stocks?  Still no action on that.
3040 2018-02-15 14:24:43 Congress never even outlawed Bump Stocks! FUCK!!!
3041 2018-02-15 14:24:42 As 1 on your constituents u disgust me. Until u take action to save our children since we are the only nation that these mass shootings happen in I will do everything to vote u out. No AK rifles or bumper stocks for civilians!!

3046 2018-02-15 14:24:04 And he was able to LEGALLY go& buy an assault weapon. No one needs an assault weapon to hunt, protect themselves. Be a LEADER& call for an end to selling assault weapons, bump stocks, magazines with hundreds of rounds. Tell NRA their $ is NOT worth kids' lives. #wishfulthinking
3047 2018-02-15 14:23:42 You removed Obama background checks so the mentally ill has access. Stopped bump stocks and large clips. Don't send thoughts and prayers. send money for mental illness and gun control.
3048 2018-02-15 14:23:42 With a maga hat in another one, but point fingers away.  Ban semi automatic weapons and bump stocks.  Period.  Tougher on mental illness and past issues of violence, simple.

3051 2018-02-15 14:23:09 @SenatorLankford  time to ban the assault rifles from stocks and silencers. Time to stop being complicit in all of these things shame on you shame on the Republican Party
3052 2018-02-15 14:23:04 I respect you and enjoy watching you.

It is not a knee jerk reaction. Reasonable gun control is something we should advocate. The idea that it’s “too soon” when we have had 18 school shootings this year is ridiculous. We still haven’t banned bump stocks after the Vegas shooting.
3053 2018-02-15 14:23:03 I agree with that...I don’t think the bump stocks to convert rifles to full automatic should be sold to the public. What the LV shooter had
3054 2018-02-15 14:22:53 Congress and the NRA lobby have blood in their hands again. Why is it so easy for evil people and nut jobs in US to get an AR-15 and bump stocks to kill dozens at a time? Why does ANYONE not in a war zone need such a weapon? #GunReformNow #FloridaShooting #ParklandShooting
3055 2018-02-15 14:22:51 Somewhat naive to think laws will stop anything. How has that worked with illegal drugs? I agree that high capacity magazines and bump stocks are an issue but do you expect people to just hand them over? When you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns.
3056 2018-02-15 14:22:48 Amen to that - it’s time to vote anyone who opposes banning assault weapons, bunk stocks and silencers OUT- there are complicit in these children’s murders - and any campaign $$$ from the NRA is covered in these children’s blood ...

3058 2018-02-15 14:22:45 How about signing a proclamation banning semi automatic weapons and gun stocks and then sign his resignation?
3059 2018-02-15 14:22:40 So...is the only solution really to just take away everyone's guns??? Or to tax the hell out of ammo? Or how about we outlaw bump stocks since they are "such a problem".
3060 2018-02-15 14:22:37 Automatic weapons have been banned since the 1930's Einstein. Obama okayed bump stocks which turns an AR15 into an automatic weapon of sorts. Thanks Obama.
3061 2018-02-15 14:22:25 @realDonaldTrump What can you say to us when you signed a bill into law allowing the mentally ill the right to purchase guns?  You need to be held accountable for this one!

3064 2018-02-15 14:21:35 Will you be recommending background checks for all gun sales? A ban of bump stocks?
3065 2018-02-15 14:21:28 Stupid question. Are you generally allowed to buy stocks on a credit card?
3066 2018-02-15 14:21:07 Haven't you ppl on the left learned yet that the more you blame the NRA, more memberships they get? More you blame guns, gun sales go up? Most gun owners became gun owners out of fear they'd lose their rights to own one. Keep an eye on gun stocks. They will be going up.
3067 2018-02-15 14:21:01 Bullshit.   We have laws about alcohol advertising.  Strong controls on sales.  We can’t even ban bump stocks or limit magazine size because of the NRA and corrupt politicians.
3068 2018-02-15 14:20:54 Using these tips, when inflation spikes, will businesses and investors be more likely to purchase and invest in stocks and bonds, and how will this increase in investment during high periods of inflation effect the overall economy? @APPropst
3069 2018-02-15 14:20:53 Lord. Y’all taking out loans for stocks 
3070 2018-02-15 14:20:48 That’s a false and unproductive narrative.

Nobody wants to do that.  We’d like to ban bump stocks, add mental health screening, and consider a national database.
3071 2018-02-15 14:20:43 The @NRA is nothing but an industry trade group who want to sell product. After every mass shooting, gun stocks rally. Pretending to care in the aftermath of tragedy is good PR, but profiting from tragedy is your business model. You are the problem.

#GunReformNow #BloodMoney
3072 2018-02-15 14:20:17 Then please sign on to ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Also reinstate the prohibition for those with mental issues.

@ANI Report.
3075 2018-02-15 14:19:57 ...endlessly about bump stocks, as if they were even remotely relevant, tells me that he's in on something. Something is hinky with this school shooting. And he also pulls his Academy Award routine, which is not remotely convincing.

So my working hypothesis at this time...
3076 2018-02-15 14:19:54 Same old shit different day. Nothing will change just as Bump stocks are still available. Prayers and thoughts can only go so far coming from these Fake Christians. Policy changes need to be discussed on how to keep AR15s out of these murderers hands. #NoOneNeedsAnAR15
3077 2018-02-15 14:19:43 Reminds me of a classic line from BarCap's head of Rates wayyyy back in the day during the commodities boom: "You think you're trading bonds today, but you're really just trading stocks and oil."
3078 2018-02-15 14:19:38 Why does anyone need a military style weapon unless they are going to war? Nothing done about bump stocks, laws stopping crazies legally  owning AK 47s repealed by trump on day 1. Doing nothing is no longer an option while kids are being butchered
3079 2018-02-15 14:19:19 Bump stocks?  What are you talking about?  People keep getting murdered by the tens of thousands every year in this country.
3080 2018-02-15 14:19:16 More empty words & white noise.
If this is how you really feel ... 
DO SOMETHING! Where's the ban on bump stocks?
You take too much $$ from the NRA (one of your bosses) to be anything but a coward when it comes to cracking down on guns. Fear of losing your seat!
#CoryCash
3081 2018-02-15 14:19:15 Will you be doing a study on AR-15’s and assault rifles that is similar to the one you bragged about voting for on bump stocks? By the way, how is that going? Never heard of any progress on that. Just more mass shootings. #Nebraska
3082 2018-02-15 14:19:15 Our thoughts are with you.  If people continue to vote for people who will not consider regulating bump stocks, strong back ground checks, and banning sale of assault weapons then they are COMPLICIT.
3083 2018-02-15 14:19:12 As long as you people are afraid of the NRA, this will keep happening. Make AR15s, bump stocks and assault weapons outlawed. Make it required that all weapons need background checks.
3084 2018-02-15 14:18:57 Hunting is killing. Hell, Republicans will not even ban bump stocks, this latest shooting will change nothing! The #NRABloodMoney owns Republican lawmakers. Vote them out or wait for the next mass shooting.

3095 2018-02-15 14:16:45 As the market and many stocks test what had become key resistance levels (9ema and 50ma), we now watch for the secondary bounce move to add positions, while trailing stops on current bounce plays to lock in gains. 
3096 2018-02-15 14:16:32 Please propose legislation to ban private ownership of assault weapons and bump stocks. Hand guns are more than sufficient for self-protection. Since you purportedly prioritize the safety of your Florida constituents, I trust that you will act swiftly. #parklandschoolshooting

3115 2018-02-15 14:13:33 U will be seeing a big pulse type structure which is going to break up a lot of large structures-buying stocks under this will make this items more likely to be volatile.#whynotwait
3116 2018-02-15 14:13:14 You can still make solid money (albeit, it's more difficult) on stocks with spreads in bear markets, you idiot.
3117 2018-02-15 14:13:11 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your cancer
3118 2018-02-15 14:13:04 Va falloir serrer les seufs et attendre un peu que ça se calme. Les prix vont un peu baisser mais les stocks des nouvelles risquent de se faire sniper vitesse lumière s'il n'y en a pas assez. Sois patient, tout ce que je peux te dire c'est : "c'est le bourdel".
3119 2018-02-15 14:12:55 She's right to blame the party that constantly takes the NRA's money and makes a serious legislative response impossible. After Vegas, we couldn't even get bump stocks banned. They have blood on their hands. Your insincere posturing and blame deflection is hollow and insulting.

3122 2018-02-15 14:12:11 thx @zerohedge This likely has implications for bonds, but God bless you if you can pick stocks with this info. #BakesTakes_
3123 2018-02-15 14:12:03 ... Mud would be like a colonel in this war. He has tried to rally his troops by saying that the government (that is, he and his buddies) are going to kill Trump. Mud's too stupid to know that his generals have fled or taken naps already.

Mud mentions bump stocks, of the kind...
3124 2018-02-15 14:11:19 @RepErikPaulsen @tomemmer @RepJoeKennedy We need a ban on AR-15 and similar weapons. We need a ban on gun bump stocks. We need to take ownership of the fact that we have a serious gun problem in this country.  We need this today. Not tomorrow. DO YOUR JOBS. #Nomoreshootings
3125 2018-02-15 14:11:18 No stand-alone bump stock ban legislation has been blocked by GOP politicians, and the @NRA has not opposed banning bump stocks.
GOP politicians *have* stood up to a bill that was a gun prohibitionist's smorgasbord of useless restrictions, that also included a bump stock ban.
3126 2018-02-15 14:11:13 @POTUS @GOP & Gov Rick Scott’s refusal to even consider sensible gun laws are the problem.   Bump stocks, large magazines, military style weapons, & semiautomatic rifles have few, if any, safe, legal uses, but are used to make mass shootings more deadly. You enable that!
3127 2018-02-15 14:10:56 With that second weapon reload as quickly? Could you fire as many bullets in as rapid succession? We have the Second Amendment, and I’m in favor of it… But let’s talk bump stocks. Why do we need those? Why didn’t they make those illegal After Vegas?
3128 2018-02-15 14:10:56 Will gun stocks go up today?
3129 2018-02-15 14:10:55 Classic pump and dumps. In an unregulated market, it's bound to happen. Even happens on some of the smaller stocks on the Dow.
3130 2018-02-15 14:10:43 #GunContolNow is trending number one. Will the politicians do anything. I think not. More fake outrage and another check from the NRA. Gun stocks rallying so disgusting. Who buys these stocks after the murder of 17 kids. Sick. #Republicans need to step up and reject the NRA.
3131 2018-02-15 14:10:36 Investors jumping into gun stocks to profit off a mass murder makes me dizzy with rage and disgust.
3132 2018-02-15 14:09:50 It’s really F’n simple. Universal background checks, ban assault weapons & other items such as body armor, bump stocks, etc used to inflict and survive major lethality. That IS NOT what should be protected by 2nd amendment!! Sorry but these ARE NOT TOYS idiots!

3137 2018-02-15 14:08:58 No matter what ppl say these mass murder shooters have nothing that would have prevented them from obtaining these ar15s. Mental health issues are forever. Most aren't diagnosed. The AR15s is what needs to go along with bump stocks.

I love the scruffy beard...

But @PressSec and @POTUS LIE.

They don’t want to see anything change so this is a complete waste of time.

Don’t believe me!?!

Why are BUMP STOCKS STILL LEGAL?

They will wait this out and DO NOTHING
3141 2018-02-15 14:08:39 @marcorubio Please propose legislation to ban assault private ownership of assault weapons and bump stocks. Handguns are sufficient weapons for self-protection. Since you purportedly prioritize the safety of your Florida constituents, I trust that you will act swiftly.#parkland
3142 2018-02-15 14:08:11 Ur *thoughts and prayers* will do nothing to END these shootings. Get onto the Senate floor &call for legislation to end selling of assault weapons, bump stocks, magazines that hold hundred of rounds. Stop being a hypocrite taking $ from NRA & then *praying* when shootings happen
3143 2018-02-15 14:08:08 Oh really, @marcorubio ? If anyone in Washington suddenly got sane and we banned automatic weapons like the AR-15 and bump stocks, do you think a deranged gunman could have killed 17 kids so quickly? Who "needs" an automatic weapon other than someone who wants to murder people?

3146 2018-02-15 14:07:31 @JoeNBC @morningmika #NRAwhore Challenge Congress to sign a pledge NEVER to accept donations from the NRA and never to entertain NRA lobbyists. America wants a ban on assault weapons & bump stocks & effective background checks. Strip the power Congress has given to the NRA now!
3147 2018-02-15 14:07:16 “High capacity stocks...” What in the fuck is a high capacity stock???
3148 2018-02-15 14:06:20 Now is WAY paste the time to confront gun control. No citizen needs an assault weapon. Still no action on "bump stocks"! GOP is in control of the gov.. ACTION NOW to prevent mass shootings!
3149 2018-02-15 14:06:03 Markets seem to be ignoring inflation pressures, US futures green pre market  A lot of SEC 13F filings have been posted as of recently revealing institutional stakes. This strategy has been a hot trade. Looking to play $OSTK on news Soros Management has a 9% stake  #stocks
3150 2018-02-15 14:05:43 Fake sympathy. If anyone on the Hill or White House cared, they would have passed laws banning assault rifles, bump stocks, military mags and more a long time ago. They keep cashing their NRA checks and pandering to nuts.
3151 2018-02-15 14:05:41 A return to economic normalcy to me would mean that bonds or credit would become as attractive to the investor as stocks in risk/reward.
3152 2018-02-15 14:05:23 There are magazines with minimal rounds, and then others have 30 or more....ban them.  Why do we need guns like the AR for civilian use? Why do we need bump stocks? People on the no fly list can still purchase guns...mass shooters are not usually criminals..prior
3153 2018-02-15 14:05:17 As an elected representative it's your job to develop policy that better protect our communities. You decide on AR-15'a, background checks, mental health checks, bump stocks, concealed carry etc. "We must" recognize the warning signs of a bad Congressman and vote for better reps
3154 2018-02-15 14:05:11 Anti-gun control folks arguing that the AR-15 is not an automatic assault weapon are actually making the case that no one needs ANY high capacity firearm with even a medium rate of fire because they are all too lethal. Idiots. Though let’s not forget Las Vegas and bump stocks!
3155 2018-02-15 14:04:58 I don't care what it is called as long as it:
Requires background checks on all gun purchases.
Bans assault style weapons for public sale. 
Bans bump stocks
Bans large capacity magazines for public sale
3156 2018-02-15 14:04:55 $AOBC $RGR $OLN stocks all up because investors know that the biggest seller of guns is fear of gun control... NRA mission is to prop up gun industry... #cuibono

3158 2018-02-15 14:04:21 One third of Trump’s campaign was funded by the NRA. $30 million...The GOP Congress protected the “rights” of those with mental health issues to buy guns. Bump stocks are legal. High capacity magazines are legal. This disturbed young man purchased his arsenal legally.
3159 2018-02-15 14:04:09 I'm just hoping enough time has passed now so that we can ban bump stocks
3160 2018-02-15 14:04:04 I wonder how quickly those cheques would lose their sparkle if an AR 15 went off near his family?  Ban Bump Stocks and get you some gun controls asshat!!
3161 2018-02-15 14:03:51 Hope my stocks surge 100,0% today
3162 2018-02-15 14:03:16 really anything? you mean confiscation, dont you. its ok, i know you want to say it. banning bump stocks wont prevent criminals from getting guns illegally and killing people. re-instate Obama-era, what?

3165 2018-02-15 14:02:31 lets see how stocks reacts to this curve flattening ....
3166 2018-02-15 14:02:29 there’s never one real answer to a bad problem there’s multiple answers and here are just some of them: better mental healthcare for kids and adults, #GunControlNow, outlaw semi-auto assault rifles & bump stocks. I like the fact in New Zealand and England there are no guns.

3168 2018-02-15 14:01:53 Plus, weapons like the AR-15 are much more easily customized with stuff like high capacity magazines and bump stocks, given the nature of their design. Sure a long rifle can kill quickly, but those modifications make the lethality of one weapon grow by magnitudes
3169 2018-02-15 14:01:53 @APPropst as the global stocks take off, can this have any ability to correct US inflation in any way?
3170 2018-02-15 14:01:48 Im all for making a dollar/using the market to my advantage but after a mass shooting in my country, i can not bring myself to buy shares of gun stocks. Couldn't with Las Vegas or Kentucky. Can't with Florida. #NYSE #GunControl

3172 2018-02-15 14:01:37 finTV talking heads don't see a problem, whatever happens the fed has it covered. Bloomberg this morning had a guest saying hot inflation data yest good for stocks on pricing power. No matter what the data is there is a media spin for it as great for equities/growth.

3174 2018-02-15 14:00:53 There is. I tend to be a middle grounder - guns for hunting and protection; no large magazines, assault weapons, bump stocks etc - but the unwillingness of the NRA to agree to ANYTHING to ridiculous degrees is pushing me further left on this issue.
3175 2018-02-15 14:00:52 not true. The bump stocks are not reliable and are at less than half as full auto.
3176 2018-02-15 14:00:47 I doubt the mentally ill can be stopped esp if they just snap. But dammit we don't need bump stocks & auto or semi auto guns. We need expanded background checks,training,blah-blah. But nothing will be done. RW will fight. LW will grandstand & then sit back down. 2/2
3177 2018-02-15 14:00:38 Banning guns isn’t the answer and Congress is working on tougher laws, banning bump stocks etc. why isn’t it done yet? We all would like to know that. I will say it’s not because the NRA is in their pocket like most assume.
3178 2018-02-15 14:00:30 Take AR-15s and similar weapons off the market. Nobody needs to own that much firepower. Reduce magazine size and ban bump stocks. Those last two won't stop shootings but they might reduce the death toll.
3179 2018-02-15 14:00:10 @RosLehtinen
Take action! Do something to end the cycle of school shootings. Pass legislation on gun laws. Background checks, mental health, bump stocks, gun show sales, all obvious changes that will save lives. Work with GOP to find any common ground Dems. Enough is enough

3182 2018-02-15 14:00:01 @gordonkeith reasonable gun control measures: treat bump stocks and any rifle magazine with a capacity of more than 5 rounds the same as you treat silencers and fully automatic weapons.

3184 2018-02-15 13:59:35 US military has access to more powerful weapons than the public. They don't need bump stocks because they already have automatic rifles. Bump stocks make semiautos military-like, i.e. more automatic.
3185 2018-02-15 13:59:31 How can republicans not enact laws banning assault weopons or requiring stricter background checks. They refuse to even ban bump stocks. Rather, they make it easier for mentally ill to buy guns. One of the reasons I am no longer an R.
3186 2018-02-15 13:59:22 Republicans couldn't even move forward with a democrat proposal to ban the sale of "bump stocks" after the Las Vegas massacre - yall think republicans will do anything after this school shooting? Come on lol
3187 2018-02-15 13:58:55 After the Las Vegas shooting there was a movement to ban bump stocks. That has already been forgotten. Apparently NRA  campaign funds are more important than the lives of our children.

3190 2018-02-15 13:58:21 .@SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP: 4 mo ago, a legal AR-15 killed nearly 60 people in Las Vegas, maimed more than 850. YOU WOULDN'T EVEN BAN BUMP STOCKS!

The 17 #Parkland kids & teachers murdered yesterday w/ another legal AR-15 were murdered by YOU. #GunReformNow
3191 2018-02-15 13:57:55 He was expelled. Try reading a report all the way through. This is on you. The NRA is more powerful than you. Will jealousy finally get you to take the steps necessary to stop the sale of semi-automatic rifles and bump stocks? Gun deaths are one more statistic that you will  win.
3192 2018-02-15 13:57:40 17 more kids DEAD. It's on YOU, @SpeakerRyan You wouldn't even bring banning bump stocks to a vote, when Your NRA rescinded its permission. How do you live with yourself? You too, @SenMajLdr McConnell @OFA
3193 2018-02-15 13:57:40 action plan Trump? If it’s silence you and NRA loving repubs are out of office next elections. Did nothing on bump stocks, rescinded obama restrictions on mentally ill, that’s all you have done! We’re in greater danger from US gun toting murderers than terroists. #guncontrol
3194 2018-02-15 13:57:29 From Ross Catrow, Good Morning RVA:  “These Virginia Senators voted NO on a bill to ban bump stocks: Carrico, Dunnavant, McDougle, Newman, Norment, Obenshain, Ruff, Stuart, Vogel and Wagner. Shameful.”
3195 2018-02-15 13:57:07 Multi-pronged approach. Stricter ratings for violence in video games, movies and TV (NC17.) Stronger background checks and confiscation of guns from those with certain diagnosed mental health or domestic violence histories. Ban bump stocks and large capacity magazines.
3196 2018-02-15 13:57:03 Cool your jets, dude.  Most people advocating for gun control are not trying to take away all of the guns. They want waiting periods, background checks, and bans on unnecessary weaponry, like bump stocks, AR-15s, high-capacity magazines.

3202 2018-02-15 13:55:56 Biometric lock. Seriously. That’s more logical to you than gun reform? More logical than banning bump stocks or semi autos, banning people on watch lists or the no fly list from purchase.
3203 2018-02-15 13:55:55 It's easy to understand.  ASSAULT RIFLES--- STOP SELLING THEM.  What about bump stocks?(VEGAS SHOOTER) NOTHING from republicans.   Republicans are gonna be out on their asses on NOV 6.
3204 2018-02-15 13:55:50 Well, for starters, really anything.  Improved background checks, re-instate the Obama-era regulations, banning bump stocks.  Incremental changes mean incrementally fewer deaths.  Faith without works is meaningless.
3205 2018-02-15 13:55:30 I sincerely believe the BTFD is so Ingrained, that the only fear is missing the rally.   Lot of factors at play, and it seems now much more than ever, so who knows,   but I sure as hell do not see any fear of stocks declining
3206 2018-02-15 13:55:27 What make people want to go out buy more guns or invest more money in stocks of companies selling weapons?  With so many mass shootings and the increase in frequency, more guns don't seem to be the answer.
3207 2018-02-15 13:54:45 Proclamation schoclamation... big deal. I want to see a proclamation banning AR15s and bump stocks.  #newday
3208 2018-02-15 13:54:40 Rick Scott, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are the three I know of who are against Gun Control! I believe in the 2nd Amendment, my family hunts deer. Other things simple things, mental health is a major issue: NO GUNS, back round check for every state and bump stocks!
3209 2018-02-15 13:54:29 We already know what to do. 8th shooting in 2018. Pass legislation on gun laws to end this cycle. Background checks, mental health, bump stocks, gun show sales, all obvious changes that will save lives. Work with Republicans to find any common ground with Dems. Enough is enough
3210 2018-02-15 13:54:28 The price of gun stocks rose before the event was over. Never waste a good crisis.
3211 2018-02-15 13:54:26 Has enough time passed on the last #MassShooting? Can we ban bump stocks now?
3212 2018-02-15 13:54:21 So everyone should be allowed to have an assault rifle and bump stocks?  He uses the most deadly thing AVAILABLE. If less if these weapons were AVAILABLE, mass murder would not ensue. Hard to kill 17 people with a goddamn knife

3225 2018-02-15 13:51:12 You say banning assault rifles, bump stocks & high-capacity magazines would just create a black-market? Of course it would, so? Just like when we ban sale & purchase of heroin, child pornography, & slaves. But, it's a good thing we do.

3230 2018-02-15 13:50:01 Rate of fire isn’t really increased by buying a “top of the line” component AR style firearm. 

That said, there’s zero practical use for bump stocks (not saying this kid used one). And semi-auto sport rifles should be difficult to obtain. Supposedly this was legal.
3231 2018-02-15 13:49:57 Massachusetts has a ban on "bump stocks" that can convert a semi-automatic assault weapon into an automatic weapon.  Although the killer in the Las Vegas Massacre used a bump stock, Trump and the Republican Congress have failed to ban bump stocks.
3232 2018-02-15 13:49:42 Producer prices up 0.4% in January, overall and core.  The Fed is behind the curve and as long as excess reserves exist, inflation is a threat.  It’s a double edge sword, though.  Increased velocity drives inflation and real growth higher.  Faster growth is good for stocks.
3233 2018-02-15 13:49:15 @POTUS @GOP @MinnesotaDFL  We need a ban on AR-15 and similar assault weapons. We need a ban on gun bump stocks. We need to take ownership of the fact that we have a serious gun problem in this country.  We need this today. Not tomorrow. DO YOUR JOBS. #Nomoreshootings

3252 2018-02-15 13:46:44 How about Congress starts with the obvious: high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
3253 2018-02-15 13:46:35 Americans have a right to buy AR-15s. But Americans don't have a right to health care.

GOP can ban abortions but the GOP can't ban AR-15s and bump stocks!

3273 2018-02-15 13:42:54 Stop the ‘thoughts & payers’ & do something. Ban bump stocks, ban assault weapons. If someone wants to shoot military assault weapon, tell them to join the military. Just stop your fake sincerity! Do your job!
3274 2018-02-15 13:42:54 If bump stocks are so deadly, why doesn’t our military use them??
3275 2018-02-15 13:42:40 This means it is actually a great hunting weapon. The problem is shit like huge magazines, bump stocks, and other crap that makes it so much worse.
3276 2018-02-15 13:42:29 You can get extended magazines, collapsible stocks, flash suppressor on many other guns, yet these "scary looking guns" are the ones targeted by politicians. Why? Because they are an easy target because of how they look. Like a civic engine in a Lambo body.

3285 2018-02-15 13:40:20 They can pass pro gun legislation, H.B. 38!  On its way to the Senate!  But NO legislation to stop NEW assault guns or bump stocks from entering our Community!  WTH!

3292 2018-02-15 13:38:48 How is banning bump stocks/semi automatic long rifles a  "hard" discussion. That comment seems fairly asinine. It's not really hard, as it is not an infringement of the 2nd amendment--it is only an argument because of how much companies profit from these sales.

3327 2018-02-15 13:33:11 Good Evening Sir@porinju
I am big fan of yours,I am 22 years old, B.E Student, fascinated by the Indian Market,I am very new to the market, I want to be known as a value investor.
I wanted to ask you that when you are buying the stocks, what is the margin of safety you look for?
3328 2018-02-15 13:33:06 So the American solution is to sell it more guns and screw the dead, since stocks go up with every new shooting?

The NRA and the politicians they bribe have a profit motive to make sure citizens will die, sooner rather than later, more rather than fewer.
3329 2018-02-15 13:33:06 If you are aware then why do you call a made up term like assault weapon?  With that said I get your point about the bump stocks, shouldn’t be allowed without special permits
3330 2018-02-15 13:32:54 Seeing the usual post-tragedy surge in gun-company stocks. Will gun-control fears spur panic-buying from gun owners this time?
3331 2018-02-15 13:32:42 1 - REAL background checks for ALL gun purchases

2 - A ban on hardware that belongs in the military (eg. AR-15 style weapons, high capacity magazines, cheat devices like bump stocks)

3 - Revoke the blanket immunity gun manufacturers & sales have from lawsuits
3332 2018-02-15 13:32:39 @KeepCup hey guys, bit gutted to have lost the plug of my keep cup, is there anywhere in London that stocks replacements (to save the cost of postage buying one online)? Thanks
3333 2018-02-15 13:31:48 Let’s stop sending Prayers & LoveGet law makers to get some Common Sense Gun LawsAR/15 illegal! Bump stocks illegal!

3334 2018-02-15 13:31:06 Is it too soon to discuss why GOP refuses to vote on ban of bump stocks? Too soon to ask Trump why overturning ban on gun sales to severe mentally ill was such a high priority?
3335 2018-02-15 13:31:02 Thank you! Hope they raise a lot, it's a great charity 
3336 2018-02-15 13:31:02 You won’t consider limiting clip sizes or banning bump stocks, but you’ll vote for reciprocity that puts more guns in the hands of dangerous people. #promassacre

3338 2018-02-15 13:30:40 How many people die from illegal immigration every year? It’s a drop in the bucket compared to the number of people who die from gun violence every year! If U want to protect people, back rational gun control legislation, (background checks, banning bump stocks, banning AR-15’s)
3339 2018-02-15 13:30:28 I think we could address gun control while we wait to figure out this whole complicated mental health stuff.

But as people will say it's too soon: how about we start with banning bump stocks?
3340 2018-02-15 13:30:00 The GOP passes more laws to ban abortion than they do to ban AR-15 and bump stocks. And with their twisted hypocritical faces stream sanctity of life!
3341 2018-02-15 13:29:38 Our versions here are modified to never able to be converted to full auto, magazines are pinned to a max of 5 rounds and accessories like bump stocks are prohibited. The violation of any of these is punishable with jail time and permanent loss of all firearms privileges
3342 2018-02-15 13:29:11 my grandfather has a much better 1971 Berkshire (now Berk A) story.. he died several years ago, but yeah.. I'll tell you one thing.. he told me never invest in stocks, and always the index.  good point pomp!
3343 2018-02-15 13:28:54 I was just looking for stocks that I could play the bullishness in cobalt and lithium with. Other way around, if miners go after the commodity rally they have upward potential?
3344 2018-02-15 13:28:51 Bump fire, whether through stocks or specific techniques, uses physics to fake automatic fire. It’s basically a big spring that causes the rifle to bounce back against your finger after each round is fired causing the subsequent round to be fired as well.
3345 2018-02-15 13:28:47 Ban assault rifles.  Do longer and better security checks.  Stop selling guns at gun shows that they can take with them.  Ban bump stocks and magazines that hold more bullets.
3346 2018-02-15 13:28:18 Yes. Also, bump stocks have been used in 1 mass shooting incident ever. And you can make one with a peeve of plastic. Sure, let's ban them. It will change nothing.
3347 2018-02-15 13:27:54 Don't forget to ban bump stocks. There's no coherent reason for any civilian to own one. Period.
3348 2018-02-15 13:27:50 How about background checks at gun shows.  No sales of guns on internet. No bump stocks no automatic weapons. How about Congress not getting any money from the NRA.
3349 2018-02-15 13:27:34 That wouldn’t be good for stocks
3350 2018-02-15 13:27:22 But still too soon to ban assault weapons and bump stocks, right? This blood is on the hands of all of you who choose assault rifles over the lives of children. We will vote all of you out.
3351 2018-02-15 13:27:07 First step is to ban assault weapons, large clips and bump stocks. 

Second step is to force current owners to turn them in for a credit.

Third step is to make the prison sentence for having one after the turn in date so long, it doesn't pay to keep one.

3355 2018-02-15 13:26:06 Let's ban civilian sale & purchase of the AR-15 and other assault weapons. Ban bump-stocks. Ban high-capacity magazines. Stop voting for politicians who accept blood money from the NRA. For God's sake, let's just do it.

3361 2018-02-15 13:24:54 He did not use a bump stock. Even so, the bump stock does not make a weapon automatic, it still pulls the trigger once for each round fired. But I also feel bump stocks should be banned.
3362 2018-02-15 13:24:41 They jump because people will fear new gun control and go out and buy more guns then the new gun control never happens and people don’t panic buy and their stocks drop
3363 2018-02-15 13:23:47 There are fairly simple things that can be done:  Smaller clips to reduce carnage.  "Cooling Off" waiting periods.  Required Social Media reports.  Ban bump stocks.  This shooter was a classic case of possibilities.

3366 2018-02-15 13:23:23 Dec 1994 TNX  fears of inflation were overwhelmed with proof of deflation. 1994 was a special year with Greenspan crashing stocks in spring with aggressive rate raises...then an ease of short rates. Stocks then took off again
3367 2018-02-15 13:22:41 Ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks/anything that allows guns to fire faster. Require gun owners to carry insurance on their firearms.
3368 2018-02-15 13:22:30 Guns should be treated like cars.  All registered, users tested, taxed, licensed, insured.  Assault weapons BANNED, along w bump stocks.  Full bg check for EVERY SALE
Guns removed from anyone who doesn't comply.  How is it we do this with vehicles but not other lethal wrapons???
3369 2018-02-15 13:21:42 Why not do make sure that nobody outside the military has access to weapons capable of automatic fire, bump stocks that hold enormous magazines of bullets? Why not guarantee Americans have health care and mental health care? But no! Guns, tax cuts, bloodshed, thoughts, prayers...
3370 2018-02-15 13:20:39 Automatic rifles are already heavily regulated. Bump stocks don’t do much, you can bump fire a weapon with your finger. You say “common sense” yet it appears that you don’t know much about guns at all

3376 2018-02-15 13:19:29 @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand I want my Senators to sign a pledge NEVER to accept donations from the NRA and never to entertain NRA lobbyists.

3378 2018-02-15 13:19:18 Ok say you folks get your way. The AR15 is banned all are taken and destroyed, everyone gets a background check. Bump stocks are gone. Why won't someone just use a shotgun or buy a Mini 14. What is your solution then?
3379 2018-02-15 13:19:11 What's wrong with this tweet budy unless ur a bhakt, its true,
3380 2018-02-15 13:18:58 Originally at $50 each, they're now down to $40. Stocks in my area are all in English, so I'm assuming they either came from the US or somewhere in Europe.

Japanese stocks always stay in Japanese, just like HORI peripherals.
3381 2018-02-15 13:18:41 So you want them to have more guns? Or, you're arguing that simple shotguns are perfectly effective for home defense, and no need for ar-15s, bump stocks and the like.
3382 2018-02-15 13:18:38 $XBI $IBB I just ran the 350 bio stocks in my sets YTD breaking into through 1/29 high and since.  Sweet spot on cumulative average returns is $NVAX at $600 million area.  Average stock to there (from larger) is up 17% to high/down 4% since.
3383 2018-02-15 13:18:27 Are these the same experts that manipulate the market? "Weed stocks way over priced....no income what so ever.....everyone sell sell sell" and they did!
3384 2018-02-15 13:17:24 I have, of course, but in the long run preserving fish stocks is in THEIR best interest.  Also worth noting that fishing is less than .05% of UK economy.
3385 2018-02-15 13:17:00 It’s like what you say in your books- Strong evil defeats weak good. When they want total gun access regardless of child murder, our response can’t be gun control, F the NRA, or no bump stocks. Our response must be - No More Guns. None.
3386 2018-02-15 13:16:56 Ban AR-15s, bump stocks, and other semi-automatic weapons. No civilian needs those.

Also, immediately - TODAY - sign a new Executive Order that reverses the one you signed in 2017 that makes it easier for mentally ill people to buy guns. #NoExcuses
3387 2018-02-15 13:16:32 You want to stop kids from feeling unsafe at school?? Support Dem bills aimed at reducing supply and access to BUMP STOCKS and semiautomatic weapons. It's a NO-BRAINER @POTUS.
3388 2018-02-15 13:16:28 A ban on individual ownership of assault weapons.  Ban bump stocks.  Lift the restriction of the computerization of gun registries.  Lift the restriction on public research funding involving guns.  Ban the NRA from making political contributions.
3389 2018-02-15 13:15:45 My question for gun owners is what is the need or purpose? What is the need or purpose for automatic weapons, military style weapons, pump stocks, silencers, extendend magazines? Then after you answer that question, answer this. Does that need outweigh the tragedies?
3390 2018-02-15 13:15:23 Difference with stocks/assets (with liquidity) is that you can always sell lower than you bought. I guess you are refererring to the allstar cards. If you bought the top you cant sell with a loss and get 50-90% of your money back.
3391 2018-02-15 13:15:21 Can i buy pnb stocks and options
3392 2018-02-15 13:15:01 Mental illness + easy access to lethal weapons translates to mass shootings! Tell the NRA assault weapons, bump stocks and ammo will be STOPPED! Mandatory background checks, cutting off the flow of money from gun lobby & campaign finance reform z MUST HAPPEN!
3393 2018-02-15 13:14:53 Oh, please. Anyone can walk into a gun show and buy a gun. Bump stocks are still legal. And, who in the hell needs a semi-automatic rifle. Again, no other country has as many gun deaths per year as the U.S.
3394 2018-02-15 13:14:31 Background checks in every single gun purchase, even private. Ability to have guns removed from possession for violent or threatening behavior. Limits on cartridges. Ban on bump stocks. Ban on assault rifles. No ammo sales online.
3395 2018-02-15 13:14:29 Have Fox News and its minions, at last, no shame? There have been 18 school shootings in the US so far this year, a good number of them with assault-type weapons, some even modified for auto or with bump stocks.
3396 2018-02-15 13:14:28 As far as who will be the buyers. Hedge funds initially. Institutionally money will follow and pensions/retail will get in when its already mooned just like they did with tech stocks. Same story diff asset. Game never changes.
3397 2018-02-15 13:14:17 Lesson learnt from #PNBScam- PSU bank stocks are the safest bets. Your money is always safe. Even if some mega scam happens, the government will keep on infusing tax-payers money without asking the management any tough questions. Where else will you see such a largesse?
3398 2018-02-15 13:14:11 1. Reinstitute the ban on assault weapons
2. Mandatory buyback of already-in-circulation assault rifles 
3. Stricter background checks & close guns show loopholes 
4. Ban bumper stocks

This seems like a reasonable start.
3399 2018-02-15 13:14:00 banning assault weapons, banning bump stocks, banning extended magazines, eliminating trade show sale without background checks, offering a gun buy back program...they could all make some incremental change. No full solution is available. But, that doesn't mean baby steps are bad

3405 2018-02-15 13:13:03 18 year olds should not be able to purchase assault weapons, we need to close gun show loopholes, better background checks, and a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks NO!  Congress needs to protect our children and grandchildren!
3406 2018-02-15 13:12:59 Best play is Sanwaria Consumer...they have got huge stocks of Soya at very low rates.
3407 2018-02-15 13:12:33 well, we should do something. the "guns don't kill people" argument does not hold water. Guns do kill people and people kill people. So, lets at least try to mitigate the risk by getting rid of bump stocks and doing background checks (for starters). But doing nothing is CRIMINAL
3408 2018-02-15 13:12:32 @VanDrewForNJ Senator Van Drew, as a member of Congress, would you support universal background checks for people purchasing firearms, a ban on bump stocks and limiting magazine capacities?
Also, what is your stance on the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act moving through Congress?

3430 2018-02-15 13:07:39 @NRA said they supported the idea of maybe talking about possibly thinking about the concept of something like hypothetically making bump stocks not entirely 100% the first thing they would defend. Then they told elected officials: vote against any ban. Blood on all their hands.

3435 2018-02-15 13:06:12 The serious problem is the inaction of the Republicans on controlling the NRA and their push to sell weapons of war to the public. No one needs bump stocks, large clips, or assault rifles to go target shooting or hunting. They caused this!

3466 2018-02-15 12:58:19 What's disgusting is that they can't see past the NRA's financial contributions to actually prevent this sorry of tragedy from happening again. The 2nd am. calls for a 'well-regulated militia', not the blind right to own assault rifles & bump stocks w/out even background checks.
3467 2018-02-15 12:57:13 Our leaders also keep saying nothing can be done.  How about enhanced #backgroundchecks #AssaultWeaponsBan? We could also ban bump stocks, high capacity magazines. Vote for people who think.
3468 2018-02-15 12:57:08 The bill to ban bump stocks died in committee, when media attention faded and the NRA told Republicans to kill it.
3469 2018-02-15 12:56:53 Personally I'm easy going. But a build up of successive regs. Gets too much.
Quotas on fishing stocks.
Child Benifits paid for children not living in UK
Vat must be at least 15%
Reduced rate must be 5%
Tampon tax
Can't have tax free gas/electric
What constitutes a standard banana
3470 2018-02-15 12:56:15 ... Brad, where are you on drafting a bill to eliminate the sale and possession of assault weapons;  a mandatory surrender of assault weapons; limitations on devices like bump stocks and expanded clips? Because your thoughts and prayers are not what we need anymore.
3471 2018-02-15 12:56:03 The misunderstanding of crytpo is considering it as universal currency.

Currency has to be long-term stable usually enforced by a 3rd party.

Otherwise it’s like trying to buy groceries with shares of stock. 

Crypto is more volitile than stocks, so less currency capable.
3472 2018-02-15 12:55:39 A local shop now stocks Talking Rain. I have to be very careful not to just walk out the door with it.
3473 2018-02-15 12:55:35 the best strategy to play this type of stocks is never have too much of it in a bad market, especially a company constant in need to raise cash.  

only to add more when there's uptick following an already established bottom(we are looking for a bottom now then a good NEWS)
3474 2018-02-15 12:55:31 Why are you blaming the victims? We have so many mass shootings in this country that we have run out of colors for ribbons. The time is to DO SOMETHING to reduce these acts of terror. Why do non military need military grade weapons like the AR-15? What about bump stocks?
3475 2018-02-15 12:55:19 So "thoughts & prayers" are over. Now its, what, fake-ass legislation that doesn't go anywhere like bump stocks after Vegas? & then double the gun show billboards all over the state, followed up by grotesque re/election campaign ads using these kids' deaths as weapons.

#America
3476 2018-02-15 12:55:18 Bump stocks.  Las Vegas. Where are we now?
3477 2018-02-15 12:55:13 Trump you took $21,000,000 from the NRA and your GOP buddies took $17,385,437 from the NRA in the last election so the NRA can keep selling ASSAULT GUNS (AK-15) and Bump Stocks to people for mass murders...Go straight to HELL!!!
3478 2018-02-15 12:55:13 @marcorubio ... that Sen is because on your watch, you’ve done nothing for dialogue and creating no positive legislation to stop bump stocks, and no ongoing agenda for anything to do with mental health issues only to feed the  prison system with more inmates - failed again Rubio
3479 2018-02-15 12:55:06 Solution needs to be multi faceted and exclude the rantings and ravings of crazy activists. I'm ok with tightening & expanding back ground checks & banning bump stocks (autos already illegal) but all bring back mental institutions,reduce media coverage, post armed teachers etc
3480 2018-02-15 12:54:57 Corporations are planning to reward shareholders with dividends. They will announce minuscule “bonuses” —not wage increases- for free publicity, then reward stock owners. 20% (the ultra rich) own 80% of stocks. You work for the rich.
3481 2018-02-15 12:54:46 Wake up, Larry!  Jesus does not approve of bump stocks,  guns in the hands of children, irresponsible people!
3482 2018-02-15 12:54:43 After every major tragedy involving guns in this country, stocks for gun manufacturers soar. If that isnt an indictment against the state of this nation and its priorities, i dont know what is..
3483 2018-02-15 12:54:32 Let’s assume that I wrote a 2 page research piece and you read all.The conclusion:
After a couple of bad weeks for stocks, a rebound usually occurs the next week that takes prices back to the midpoint. The following week,there is real potential to roll down with support retested.
3484 2018-02-15 12:53:34 It sickens me that we still chose to beef with each other when Donald T. Is ruining our country. 401k taking major hits, stocks are down, holding people tax refunds, inflation is way up, and he’s still making his billions with his friends millions untaxed! Wake up America!
3485 2018-02-15 12:53:24 Prayers aren't enough, please introduce legislation to ban bump stocks, Assault weapons, more background checks, better mental health evaluations and services.  we need a multi pronged apprach...enough is enough..
3486 2018-02-15 12:52:43 Well, if you've ever owned one of these firearms you know what a bump stock can be replicated by simply Loop in your thumb through your belt loop. So for future firearm arguments, bump-stocks are a weak place to start.
3487 2018-02-15 12:52:14 Coinbase is garbage with this waiting time for fund clearance. Hopefully Robinhood is instant like with stocks when crypto is available to buy #Robinhood #cryptocurrency #ETH #ethereum #tron #trx tron

3489 2018-02-15 12:51:00 .@ChrisCuomo says that "bump stocks were an obvious fix in Vegas" (he means a ban?) and that the fix in Fla is equally easy and obvious (yet unnamed by him).

3493 2018-02-15 12:50:53 お酒飲めるようになるまであと1年かぁ
3494 2018-02-15 12:50:52 How does a 19 year-old in Florida, a person not old enough to buy a fifth of vodka at a liquor store, get to walk into a gun store and buy an AR-15?  After Las Vegas, how do bump stocks remain legal? Do you now support universal background checks?
3495 2018-02-15 12:50:49 What is a "Universal Background Check"? How is it different from existing NICS background checks?

Go ahead and create special licensing for bump stocks or just ban them. They're useless.
3496 2018-02-15 12:50:28 An important key to investing is to remember that stocks are not lottery tickets.  #FolloForFolloBack

3498 2018-02-15 12:50:00 No stupid wall would have prevented this, take on the NRA and gun control. A mentally disturbed person should not be able to get a semi automatic weapon. And why no background checks or ban on bump stocks?
3499 2018-02-15 12:49:33 They all realize THEY WOULDN'T BE AMERICANS themselves right?? Stop wasting time and money on a FAKE THREAT!  The real threat is bump stocks and AR-15 s
3500 2018-02-15 12:48:50 Stocks thinking Lets keep inflating ourselves also then.. ;)
3501 2018-02-15 12:48:32 Steps to take:
1. Security for ALL schools w/cameras, metal detectors, etc
2. Restrictions on bump stocks & size of clips
3. Licensing to own weapons that includes training certification & background checks
4. Improve mental health issue handling & reporting
3502 2018-02-15 12:47:46 How about limiting gun magazines to 10 or less and banning modifications like bump@stocks and extended magazines? Also, maybe a database of who owns what guns to track those who help get guns into the hands of criminals easier? Also limit the types of@guns available to the public
3503 2018-02-15 12:47:44 That’s absolutely ridiculous sentiment. If you had stringent gun laws it would keep limit the guns in hands of abusers. Having mental health checks along with background checks & not selling bump stocks & AK-47’s would definitely limit these horrific tragedies. #UseYourHeads
3504 2018-02-15 12:47:29 But...but...bump stocks.
3505 2018-02-15 12:47:15 Buy stocks!
3506 2018-02-15 12:45:17 Ban assault weapons and bump stocks, close gun show loopholes, better background checks NOW!!
3507 2018-02-15 12:45:09 And as usual congress will do nothing! We can’t even get rid of bump stocks for God’s sake.

Asia AM Digest: British Pound Hurt, Yen Down…
3510 2018-02-15 12:43:31 After every mass shooting, nothing has changed. Something as simple as background checks failed. Last year, congress wouldn't ban bump stocks, something totally unnecessary. It is both @GOP & @DNC that do nothing. Obama couldn't with a majority in the Senate.
3511 2018-02-15 12:43:16 Wonder if it has any affects on stocks
3512 2018-02-15 12:42:26 Remember, the second amendment says that our militia needs to be WELL REGULATED.  Don't ban all guns. Ban assault rifles. Ban bump stocks that turn guns into assault weapons.

Making these things illegal will make them harder to get.  Period
3513 2018-02-15 12:42:22 It is time to stop this madness. We absolutely need to reign in our gun rights. 
NO sales to mentally ill. 
NO sales to minors. 
NO sales of automatic weapons. NO bump stocks. 
Background checks for every gun sale and buy back of all guns.
3514 2018-02-15 12:42:02 Is it possible that those households from 70 years ago owned shotguns for hunting and not AR15s, semi auto hand guns, extended magazines and bump stocks?
3515 2018-02-15 12:41:56 @realDonaldTrump @GOP 
This is a Lame Ass Congress & a bigger Lame Ass POTUS. Congress promised to ban Bump Stocks after Vegas. That was all smoke & mirrors. We want background checks. These GOP's are in the pocket of the NRA. Let's get rid of them in the mid-term elections.
3516 2018-02-15 12:41:43 [] to those who paid already for the stocks sales, I'll ship them tomorrow ~ also I'll re open the for tonight and add some goods!

3521 2018-02-15 12:40:50 Hold Republicans accountable. Do something to end the cycle. Pass legislation that includes background checks, mental health, bump stocks, gun show sales, all obvious changes that will save lives. Lives depend on it. Kids are dying. Auburn, WA resident
3522 2018-02-15 12:40:46 No you are throwing shit into the batter because you have no clue how to bake the cake. What gun laws specifically would have stopped this shooting from happening? Bump stocks?  So like your pants loops. Or rubber bands? Stronger background checks? More specific? What?
3523 2018-02-15 12:40:40 Do you think that at the signing of the constitution they envisioned ar15's and bump stocks in private sale to anyone who wants them? I have a hard time believing they wrote that law with this future in mind.

3527 2018-02-15 12:40:14 It’s so cool that the president of our United States is a racist, sexist, ignorant sexual aggressor who likes to bully his “peers” (peer is a stretch), shame victims, and obsess over receiving public praise. But stocks are up, so. 
3528 2018-02-15 12:40:06 Reuters: POLL-US #natgas stocks seen down 183 in week ended Feb. 9. This compared to 120 bcf draw same week last year; 5-year ave of 154 bcf draw. Note: POLL is survey of natural gas analysts' EIA storage estimates.
3529 2018-02-15 12:39:55 Sure, we can,  but the Las Vegas legislature will not be addressing banning bump stocks until January 2019 !
3530 2018-02-15 12:39:13 Find your local camera shop that stocks film. They might even have some close expired going cheap. Important to to support local film stockists. Good luck 
3531 2018-02-15 12:39:11 Ignore Zillow. Ignore RedFin. Focus on local market dynamics. In reality, a house is only worth what someone is prepared to pay for it (just like stocks) yet you can’t get an intraday price on your home like you can with an ETF.
3532 2018-02-15 12:38:59 The basterds can't even outlaw bump stocks
3533 2018-02-15 12:38:28 You would know! What are you going to do about it Twitter in Chief?
95% of American’s support stronger background checks. 
79% favor banning assault style weapons. 
Let’s decrease magazine capacity. Let’s ban bump stocks. 
Nope, here in Florida we’ll pay for your funeral WTF!
3534 2018-02-15 12:38:23 Would have prevented using military AR15 at least.... high capacity clips  bump stocks armor piercing bullets.... so do domething @marcorubio
3535 2018-02-15 12:37:56 Oxford Station stocks it too. In fact they always seem to have a large amount of stock...
3536 2018-02-15 12:37:37 The time for action is now.  It is time for all to pass a ban on assault rifles, bump stocks and the ghost guns. It is pass time to support better back ground checks. We need Action Now!  @TomColeOK04
3537 2018-02-15 12:37:23 Why was nothing done after Vegas? Nothing! Not even with bump stocks! Read the 2nd amendment and think...does it still apply today?
3538 2018-02-15 12:37:00 There's actually a self-interest argument for the NRA agreeing to token gun regs. People are buying fewer guns under Trump bc there's no threat of them not having that ability in the future. NRA could scare 'em to gin up business by agreeing to e.g. bump stocks, expanded mags.
3539 2018-02-15 12:36:23 Trump allowing people with issues to purchase is not helpful. Fix the deficiencies in NICS. Have ATFE handle bump stocks. Armed forces to report properly. No campaign donations to the GOP from the NRA. Cruz and Ryan big winners. Simple FREE fixes. Did I say FREE?
3540 2018-02-15 12:35:14 Maybe it *shouldn't* be a right. Maybe it should be *earned*, by proving competence, proving no mental health issues (above and beyond the American love of therapy), mandatory insurance, limiting military-style weaponry, bump stocks and so forth and no relevant criminal record.
3541 2018-02-15 12:34:49 Can’t Congress start with the obvious:  high capacity magazines and bump stocks?

3545 2018-02-15 12:33:21 Do something to end the cycle. Pass legislation that is tough on gun laws. Background checks, mental health, bump stocks, gun show sales, are all obvious changes that will save lives. Work with Republicans to find any common ground. Lives depend on it. Palos Verdes resident

3548 2018-02-15 12:32:24 You just do not get it!  We Need ban on assault weapon and bump stocks, better background checks, and closing gun show loopholes NOW!  Why Won’r YOU STAND UP TO NRA AND TAKE A LEAD ON THIS?? Save our children and Grandchildren!

3551 2018-02-15 12:31:06 Stop selling this type gun that is meant to kill people. Stop selling huge amounts of ammo and clips that hold 80 bullets. Bump stocks need to go. Why do we not learn?
3552 2018-02-15 12:30:32 Do something to end the cycle. Pass legislation that is tough on gun laws. Background checks, mental health, bump stocks, close sale of gun show sales, are all obvious changes that will save lives.  Work with Republicans to find any common ground. Lives depend on it.
3553 2018-02-15 12:30:24 Really, that’s ur take on this? It’s easy to cry fowl after a crime, but seriously, as many guns as their is in America, do u think a law would make em disappear? I mean, bump stocks were unheard of until Vargas, but after, everyone was getting them...
3554 2018-02-15 12:29:20 No. We need a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, better background checks, and closing gun show loopholes NOW!  Unfortunately we have a President who will not lead on this!
3555 2018-02-15 12:29:19 I see it as growing, it is diversifying into ESA projects and only today the stocks raised. As far as their wing production I'm not in that sector, so cannot speak authoritatively. There was something today regarding UK/French corruption activity, but wouldn't like to speculate.
3556 2018-02-15 12:28:01 Yet they voted to allow mentally ill to own guns. They refuse to enforce background checks. Refuse to ban bump stocks. Refuse to ban assault rifles.

But they do offer prayers.
3557 2018-02-15 12:27:58 That’s not the case, but keep trolling. I’m responding to your arguments as you keep dodging mine. What is the argument against making gun laws stronger? What’s the argument agains common sense reform? Banning bump stocks, stronger background checks, longer waiting periods?
3558 2018-02-15 12:27:45 Expecting selloff again in US stocks on the US open, doesn't mean it will happen nor will I enter short, just treading with care looking for buy entries
3559 2018-02-15 12:27:31 NO ONE NEEDS ASSAULT RIFLES, BUMP STOCKS OR HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES! COMMON SENSE GUN CONTROL!
3560 2018-02-15 12:27:25 40,000 citizens aren’t killed each year by guns. You can’t compare terror attacks to the real issue that guns need to be regulated, esp.assault weapons like the AR15. No one wants to take your guns; we do want to regulate the sales & ban those frigging bump stocks.
3561 2018-02-15 12:27:22 stocks at the main exporters are going to be pulled down at the end of this summer(red) even with big US crop. Even with larger US 2018 crop(+1.5 mln. acre @49.5 yld) stocks are tighter next Mar than the last 3 years....  48.5 takes them back close to 2013 levels

3563 2018-02-15 12:26:59 True but military style weapons makes killing a lot of people much easier and the same with bump stocks. And  more extensive background checks could prevent at least some people from having weapons who should not have them

3565 2018-02-15 12:26:53 Do something!! We couldn’t ban bump stocks after Las Vegas??? As a law maker you are elected to do a something!! I’m not proud to see your name as one of the elected officials who receives the most money from the NRA. Advocate for your constituents, not lobbyists.

3567 2018-02-15 12:26:48 Ban assault weapons and bump stocks, close gun show loopholes, and better background checks would be a great place to start!  Unfortunately our President will not lead on this!
3568 2018-02-15 12:26:47 How about Congress starts with high capacity magazines and bump stocks?
3569 2018-02-15 12:26:07 And what abt all those guns Mr. President?  He was 19 yrs old, what would he need a military gun for? 2nd Amendment was added in 1791, it was not for military weopens to kill Americans! Our forefathers couldn't dream of this type of weapon, or bump stocks.
3570 2018-02-15 12:25:55 AR15 need to be banned PERIOD. Bump stocks need to be banned PERIOD. NRA needs to be disbanded PERIOD. When will Congress do something?
3571 2018-02-15 12:25:25 essentially you are confusing stocks and flows. Hyperinflation is a flow distortion - we could call it "hypervelocity". Asset price rises are a balance sheet distortion - those who have assets benefit at the expense of those who don't.
3572 2018-02-15 12:24:46 We need to. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks, better background checks, and closing gun show loopholes would be a fantastic start. Unfortunately we have a President who will not lead on any of this!
3573 2018-02-15 12:24:31 How can you be so sure? Why isn’t it at least worth trying? Universal background checks? Preventing violent criminals from getting lethal weapons? Outlawing bump stocks that make regular guns into military grade weapons?
3574 2018-02-15 12:22:47 shorting stocks like ASML...
3575 2018-02-15 12:22:42 Let's talk about why bump stocks weren't banned after Las Vegas... 
3576 2018-02-15 12:22:33 How many deaths in MD, have been attributed to bump stocks? Answer 0.  How many citizens are the Democrats trying to disarm?  All of them. Hence why they want to repeal the Impartial HPRB and replace it with a partisan judge.
3577 2018-02-15 12:22:18 The Implied Volatility Index has plunged by half in recent days, after spiking well above 30. That is usually taken as a sign that the worst is over and the storm has passed. Similar spikes-and-plunges, however, led to weak returns in stocks and an increase in volatility.

3582 2018-02-15 12:21:20 Ok so if u don’t have any stocks, investments, 401k plan, #crytpo, real estate etc etc then no is right; vote for Bernie he will give you free shit
3583 2018-02-15 12:21:09 The Las Vegas and Florida shootings were anomalies, not regular occurrences. Perhaps bump stock restrictions may be a good idea. But there is no indication that "bump stocks" were used in the last high profile shooting.
I support SOME gun control. I also supportConcealedCarry.
3584 2018-02-15 12:21:05 How about banning assault weapons and also include bump stocks.
3585 2018-02-15 12:20:57 Problem in America is the nra donate money (and a shite load at that) to us senators who are the ones who would be responsible to bring in gun control at a cost to the nra.stocks shares of gun manufacturers go UP after a shooting so it's not in the nra's interest to change
3586 2018-02-15 12:20:38 So, what’s your agenda? Why would you allow bump stocks and mod kits to be legal? Why should we allow gun show sales? Why can we amend numerous portions of the Constituion, but not the second amendment?
3587 2018-02-15 12:20:30 Please Please Please. ACT NOW CONGRESS!!!!!     NO silencers or Bum stocks thorough background checks. Allow CDC to conduct research
3588 2018-02-15 12:19:35 And....we need to get rid of bump stocks & AR or AK anything. Any hunter will tell u they don’t need an automatic anything to kill a deer or a turkey. That’s what’s responsible for so many mass murders: today in Fla, the TX church, Las Vegas, etc.

Stocks rising: stocks don’t mean anything about the economy! They are totally irrelevant!
Stocks falling: look what trump has done to the economy!! The stock market is crashing!! Told you we are doomed!!
Stocks rising again: the stock market doesn’t represent anything
3596 2018-02-15 12:17:55 You have a choice you keep taking money from the NRA are you protect those children in the schools you ban bump stocks and automatic rifles. But I got a feeling you're going to pick money over children's lives
3597 2018-02-15 12:16:52 Disons qu’un problème de stock risque vite d’être un problème pour les patients... Bon. On en n’est pas là, mais j’imagine que les stocks de Priorix ne sont pas  prévus pour une surconsommation.

3599 2018-02-15 12:16:47 Yes ! Working for Starbucks really got me into stocks, I was wondering if by any chance you have heard any such thing as “stock financial classes” or anything lol.
3600 2018-02-15 12:16:33 Well done Rebecca. XX
3601 2018-02-15 12:15:58 Someone explain how a well regulated militia became an unregulated individual and why is an AR-15 even necessary not to mention bump stocks. #crickets #GUNviolence
3602 2018-02-15 12:15:32 You have to honestly think about your future and I’m so upset that I’m just now really learning the meaning behind stocks and investments but I’m glad I finally started 
3603 2018-02-15 12:14:30 What will prayers do? Take bipartisan action and do something! This is the 18th shooting this year! Do you want to tweet this again? Guess what?  You can still have a second amendment and legislate against bump stocks, ARs.
3604 2018-02-15 12:13:57 No point missed.  I just corrected the misstated fact that nobody did anything against bump stocks.
3605 2018-02-15 12:13:36 3 stocks 1 custom seems pretty interesting
3606 2018-02-15 12:13:06 You’re not heartbroken enough to do your job and pass laws to stop it you NRA hack. In fact you pass laws to encourage it. Thanks for the bump stocks asshole
3607 2018-02-15 12:12:01 I agree. However some moves are too broken, you saw that Kirby killing Luigi at 20... the better solution imo is to increase the number of stocks as well imo.
3608 2018-02-15 12:11:04 Sorry Becky but there is no reason on God's green earth that we need AR-15s in the hands of civilians.  So since we've been trying the "more guns, less regulation" for all this time how about we try reinstating the ban on assault weapons and banning bump stocks just for giggles
3609 2018-02-15 12:10:59 Except 30-year old Buffett was buying cigar butt stocks.
3610 2018-02-15 12:10:58 Yet again Trump and Republicans will take no action except to make it even easier to get gums, silencers, bump stocks. Hey Trump. Majority of mass shootings are by US citizens who are white makes. Maybe you should have a ban on white males instead of Muslims or other immigrants
3611 2018-02-15 12:10:29 How about protecting us from assault weapons and bumper stocks? Any plans on that?
3612 2018-02-15 12:09:37 now it's parents. Vegas it was bump stocks.

3615 2018-02-15 12:07:20 Gov. Scott: How could this happen???? Gun control, assault rifle, bump stocks, mental illness. This is how it happened before,happened now & unless our lawmakers do something, will happen again. Why did trump get rid of obama's mentally ill registry so that anyone could get guns?
3616 2018-02-15 12:07:07 Still wrong? Lol.. 
Background checks in all States, co comprehensive insurance on each weapon. Ar15's and all on demand fire rate rifles are banned. Limit magazine size. Random mental health checks for gun owners. Bump stocks banned. Must be over 21 to purchase a weapon.
3617 2018-02-15 12:07:04 Fine. Ban all guns. I was trying to find a  common sense middle ground. And yes, I know. But I do not know yet if the gun was modified with kits or bump stocks.
3618 2018-02-15 12:06:31 Why is it stupid?  Are huge clips, bump stocks, etc necessary for law abiding gun owners and hunters?  Why not let citizens buy grenades, bazookas?  We can’t stop evil but should we make it this easy?

3648 2018-02-15 11:55:41 To gun rights nuts: I don't care if each person owns a thousand handguns or hunting rifles or shotguns. Just don't allow semi-automatic assault weapons  with bump stocks. That alone would save 100 lives each year. Please, it is time for some common sense from NRA voters!

3659 2018-02-15 11:51:49 Some simple safe gun control actions: ban bump stocks, ban automatic weapons of war, strengthen background checks, fix gun show loopholes, address mental health problem, publicize NRA donations to politicians. It is not hard if America had any leadership.@WhiteHouse
3660 2018-02-15 11:51:26 Yeah. Ban ARs. Remember that it was Reagan who banned auto weapons- most Republicans thought it was common sense. Then it lapsed, people started buying the ARs, and gun makers were making a lot of money. End of story right there. Ban bump stocks.
3661 2018-02-15 11:51:24 This sounds like a true CEO. Lol. It’s a shame he has to wake up each day living with the thought he manipulates and lies to people who invest their hard earned money. This is just my opinion. Due your due diligence when investing in stocks and in this case, people.
3662 2018-02-15 11:50:29 Update stocks na po guys...
3663 2018-02-15 11:50:15 We are talking specifics 
1. Bump Stocks 
2. Assualt type weapons 
Are these needed for home defence?
3664 2018-02-15 11:48:26 You are mistaken. Congress has failed to make bump stocks illegal

3666 2018-02-15 11:48:13 Ban bump stocks and other modifications, automating the gun.
3667 2018-02-15 11:47:57 Cory, I'm a supporter of yours. I'm asking you to return any NRA money to any senators. I'm ok with owning guns just not auto and bump stocks. Also we need regulations and check points. TY for all you do.
3668 2018-02-15 11:47:23 Where can Govt Bond money go? Stocks, commodities (previously unloveds)
3669 2018-02-15 11:47:11 Anyone with a do nothing attitude, is complicit in the next shooting. Are bump stocks still legal? Make guns harder to get, stricter/harsher penalties for buying/selling illegal guns, make background checks a necessity in every legal sale, private or otherwise. Do ANYTHING!!
3670 2018-02-15 11:46:18 Just stop. You're not going to get me to believe that the NRA is a positive organization. They are in need of massive reform or outright replacement, coupled with new legislation to keep military grade guns, bump stocks, away from regular citizens.

3672 2018-02-15 11:46:03 I would like to see the ratio of Democrats owning firearm stocks and Republicans owning stock in firearms. The Democrats know the more they push gun control the more money they make on their stocks from panic buying.Obama has been the best gun salesman the last 8 years straight
3673 2018-02-15 11:45:40 I would like top have more dollars to buy the top 2.  Sell stocks, bonds and other illiquid assets buy back cheaper when price goes down.  Real Estate value is due for a hit.
3674 2018-02-15 11:45:27 Yes i've been saying that. And stocks are not instant gratification. It's setting up and there is no magic day it will happen. if you haven't noticed, it has based at $2.00 for a long time. That's actually very very good
3675 2018-02-15 11:45:04 @senrobportman hold hearings. Form a task force. Bring a vote to the floor on mandatory background checks, large magazines, bump stocks, closing loopholes, etc. DO SOMETHING!!!!
3676 2018-02-15 11:44:51 My condolences also. Another school shooting. Nation will mourn for a few day. Then will be forgotten until the next shooting. This week assault rifles sales will skyrocket. Gun stocks will rise. While family bury children. When will this stop? Assault rifles need to be banned
3677 2018-02-15 11:44:13 Most of that is already in place, it just needs to be handled better in practice. I think bump stocks already require the same background checks  but that may just be a State by State thing
3678 2018-02-15 11:44:09 It sadly happens after every shooting. Gun sales go up and the stocks with them because people think new regulations are coming. In the Obama years, there was reason to believe that regs would come. It doesn’t make as much sense now.

3685 2018-02-15 11:42:03 The @GOP (@NRA) controlled Congress will pull the typical thoughts and prayers then publically hibernate until the news cycle moves to something else.  Remember after Vegas the talk of banning bump stocks?  How’d that work out.  They delay long enough so they don’t do anything.
3686 2018-02-15 11:41:42 You make it sound like bump stocks have been made less of a concern somehow. Also you've ignored how he pointed out your logical problem when you brought up Chicago.
3687 2018-02-15 11:41:29 Doesn't do any good... @NRA just buys the other party. Obama tried this and 7 Dem Senators voted with @GOP to defeat a simple background check bill. After Vegas, couldn't even get bump stocks banned... who uses bump stocks? #seemshopeless

3690 2018-02-15 11:38:33 Seriously? They still aren't talking about VEGAS! They legalized bump stocks in response. Perhaps if they're forced to have the conversation, we wouldn't be talking about another shooting at a school...or a church...or park...or nightclub...or concert. It's lunatics WITH guns
3691 2018-02-15 11:38:03 @robportman Spare us your prayers on street corners. You & your party bear blame for every young life snuffed. You took over 3 mil. of NRA $$ - STOP IT!

3698 2018-02-15 11:34:59 There response to Vegas was to legalize bump stocks.

Bumps stocks

Automatic weapons

3701 2018-02-15 11:33:28 sorting stocks is not cool !! ;__;
3702 2018-02-15 11:33:26 Semi automatic weapons are legal, bumpp stocks legal, He ll fire triggers legal.
3703 2018-02-15 11:33:24 You know it’s going to be a good day, when you’re up 12% in stocks; from the previous closing Depite the huge crash within last few weeks, it was the best time to invest  #BigWins
3704 2018-02-15 11:32:42 After the Las Vegas massacre, PresidentvTrump said “we will look at the gun issue  at some later date”.  Bump stocks? Nothing. Guns? Nothing. Golf? Many.
3705 2018-02-15 11:32:25 Another great piece of art Rebecca!

3706 2018-02-15 11:32:00 AR15, bump stocks & other assault weapons are for the purpose of protecting Americans from "bad guys" so the assumption is those 17 people killed in Florida were with ISIS right?
3707 2018-02-15 11:31:58 In 1996 16 children were shot to death at school in #UK. We banned handguns. No-one complained. #America has these every few weeks and it can't even ban bump stocks. Annual gun deaths per 100,000 population: US: 10.54, UK: 0.23. Speaks for itself. #FloridaShooting #Parkland

3709 2018-02-15 11:31:44 like you can have stocks enough to buy a small house at least.
3710 2018-02-15 11:31:34 Local/global histories. "Cottons came first to southern England, and Southampton probate inventories from the 1550s include merchants with calico stocks, while Southampton's affluent commercial and middling classes had East Indian textiles among their home furnishings." (Lemire).
3711 2018-02-15 11:31:32 Have proper background checks for people purchasing guns, ban bump stocks, these are two ideas
3712 2018-02-15 11:31:16 AR15s, bump stocks & other assault weapons are for the purpose of protecting Americans from "bad guys" so the assumption is those 17 people killed in Florida were with ISIS right? As well as the other "bad dudes" killed at schools this year?
3713 2018-02-15 11:31:14 Then do something.
Laws needed on
Bump stocks
Silencers
Gifting guns
Background checks on mental health and social media 

Do your job
3714 2018-02-15 11:31:04 Ilan na lang po stocks nung kay kyungsoo??
3715 2018-02-15 11:30:56 @TheEllenShow THE VERY FUCKING SICK THING ID JUST ABOUT EVERY GUN SHOP IN FLORIDA WAS OPEN 24 HOURS SELLING ABOUT EVERY GUN. WITH ALL THESE GUNS BEING SOLD THE STORE OWNERS LOVE THESE SHOOTINGS AND GUN STOCKS GO HIGH ON MARKET AND STORES WILL SELL TO ANYONE BECAUSE BACKGROUND
3716 2018-02-15 11:29:07 I checked some item on Facebook market and Facebook sent to some random person a a message to ask if the item is available.

Facebook is really becoming way too fuckin creepy to handle now. 

Time to sell those stocks.
3717 2018-02-15 11:28:38 @krishnakhanna Sir, Can we write a simple query in Chartink, where it will show stocks which have TGC true in HTF (W& M) and false in LTF i.e. daily trend? Usually, daily price trend follows HTF and we have a very recent short term downtrend behind us.
3718 2018-02-15 11:28:14 Show who profits over the Massacre of our children with guns @MSNBC. Show us how the stocks go up for gun manufacturers immediately after children dying.
3719 2018-02-15 11:27:40 Yes but how about that stock market. Every time our kids get slaughtered we run to the gun dealer to be sure we get some more before they are all gone! Sales sales money money stocks stocks. We’ve lost our fucking minds. Gov too busy fixing to screw elderly out of everything.
3720 2018-02-15 11:26:28 Me: are you active on Twitter?

3721 2018-02-15 11:26:13 I’ve got a huge short bias over the next couple days, moving to the sideline today to wait on an attractive point to start scaling in. Not liking the $SPY action or the action in large cap energy stocks. Bias is more of an overall market one rather than specific sector. Patience.
3722 2018-02-15 11:25:02 The cause of this isn't supernatural- it's incompetence & selfishness of lawmakers who care more about what they get from gun lobbyists, the NRA, & Ppl wanting assault rifles/ bump stocks over the lives of everyone else- including children. When we do nothing, nothing changes
3723 2018-02-15 11:24:58 This is your response to another mass shooting?  Your pathetic.  Bump stocks, 30 round mags, assault rifles, armor piercing rounds, etc are not part of the problem? Keep standing with the #NRA and the #GOP while our children die.
3724 2018-02-15 11:24:30 Hi Tweeps! Getting everything ready for my huge #ChineseNewYear party tomorrow! Quite a lot of organising to do but things are going smoothly enough! Stocks so far today again looking solid!
3725 2018-02-15 11:23:30 Enough is enough ban military style weapons, expanded clips, bump stocks  NOW!!!
3726 2018-02-15 11:23:26 If your right to buy a semi-automatic rifle, one meant to be used in war, was removed, how would we not survive?  If bump stocks and large clips were banned, how would we not survive?  I have 4 guns and don’t want to give them up. No one of them is able to kill 30 people in mins.
3727 2018-02-15 11:22:52 Remember the outrage over bump stocks- they make an AR-15 automatic. What has been done about that ???? Do you really thing your stale tired arguments make any difference to those families this morning. Be quiet!
3728 2018-02-15 11:22:26 Aur Agar stocks me rakho to Jatley ka dar.
3729 2018-02-15 11:22:17 The hypocrisy is unbelievable. Whatever happened with the ban on bump stocks? Zero, and that was easy. All politicians are to blame for this. Republican and Democrat. They are equally afraid to take a stand for fear of losing votes. #GunContolNow

3732 2018-02-15 11:20:48 1. We don't sell military grade assault weapons to civilians. 2. We don't have bump stocks or extended mags. 3. We require training before issuing licenses. 4. Our last terrorist used a knife and uhaul during his attack - 0 people killed. 5. We don't sell to mentally ill people.

3735 2018-02-15 11:18:48 The Bible says "if a person knows to do good and does it not to him it is sin." YOU REFUSE TO PASS COMMON SENSE GUN LAWS. LIKE BANNING BUMP STOCKS AND SHOULD ANY CITIZEN REALLY NEED TO OWN A MILITARY GRADE ASSAULT RIFLE LIKE THE AR-15? (I call it the antichrist rifle)
3736 2018-02-15 11:14:40 3/ i grew up in the country and used a gun from an early age to hunt, kill varmints, etc. I am an excellent marksman and enjoy shooting. And i can honestly say, there is no legitimate reason we need semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks. Unless the goal is to kill a lot of ppl.
3737 2018-02-15 11:14:05 And............... The Stock Market Rally will Continue  #stocks #trading
3738 2018-02-15 11:14:04 You forgot that stocks in companies involved in the high school child murder industry will go up. Otherwise spot on.
3739 2018-02-15 11:13:51 Pass more gun laws? Why do people need to own AR-15s or bump stocks?
3740 2018-02-15 11:13:30 I would be afraid to go to school....bump stocks..now silencers are being introduced. . mental illness is not the only issue.the type of weapon is designed for maximum carnage
3741 2018-02-15 11:12:16 And making owning automatic weapons and bump stocks illegal would help. No private citizen needs these. None.
3742 2018-02-15 11:12:05 ひぃ...(了解です)

3748 2018-02-15 11:08:12 I called one of ur dealers out here in Sagamu,Ogun state,he said you people are in ready to do business coz since November they have been expecting ur decoder dishes still you keep on telling them to wait till the stocks get available
3749 2018-02-15 11:07:52 The founders made it that way ON PURPOSE!! Where in the constitution does it say we have the right to bump stocks? Or assault weapons?? Legislation can be made to increase background checks to not allow access to essentially military weapons!
3750 2018-02-15 11:07:51 Is this the Great Rotation of bonds into stocks? Or was it supposed to be the other way?

3753 2018-02-15 11:06:14 Bump stocks illegal? Cite the bill that passed making them illegal. My understanding is those federal bills went nowhere. Couldn’t even ban bump stocks - pathetic. And now they want to make silencers legal again
3754 2018-02-15 11:06:09 They didnt even ban bump stocks. Smh. #MorningJoe

3756 2018-02-15 11:03:58 But silencers and bump-stocks are ok. They can't even handle the simple, common sense stuff
3757 2018-02-15 11:03:02 As an American citizen it is your RIGHT. There are always derranged people with assault weapons or homemade bump stocks. You at least want a fighting chance and it could deter more mass murders. If the ratio was reversed, would we ban cars or make it harder to obtain a license?
3758 2018-02-15 11:02:58 Register, license, tax. Universal background checks. Require safety training and secure storage. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Reasonable limits on ammo.

3761 2018-02-15 11:01:17 There were 1.5 million AR-15s sold last year. There aren't 1.5 million Soldiers in the Army! Bump stocks, no action. Hinkley Jr., caused the Brady bill, SCOTUS reverses the only bipartisan gun legislation, and we are here now. #prayforcobgresstoact
3762 2018-02-15 11:01:07 What are you gonna do about it? The same thing you did about bump stocks? Spare us your empty gestures and meaningless rhetoric.

Ban bump stocks completely.
Ban hollow point and mags over 30 rounds.Limit 1 AR/AK platform purchase to 1 per month

3768 2018-02-15 10:58:18 Yeah. You're giving out bump stocks to everyone except MS-13.

Idiot.
3769 2018-02-15 10:57:25 Bump stocks are legal. NRA tried to promote them, along with getting silencers out on the market. The NRA is a terrorist organization, makes millions off the deaths of our children and so do the GOP. GOP doesn't care about your second amendment they are about their wallets.
3770 2018-02-15 10:57:13 It is a possibility. But we also have a stack more public and private debt now. Some traders who have been so right like Juliette Declercq @JulietteJDI on the USD and stocks (Was bullish S&P to 2700) is saying she wouldn't want to buy this dip. I have to think she could be right

3773 2018-02-15 10:56:24 @SpeakerRyan Speaker Ryan, We want the NRA to be sanctioned off from buying politicians! We want assault rifles & bump stocks banned. We want stricter gun & ammo regulation & laws. Your way isn't working. Try our way now.
3774 2018-02-15 10:56:22 Nope, they weren't. They were modified semis using legally purchased bump stocks etc. And still no laws to stop that easy modification.

3780 2018-02-15 10:54:29 Keep your guns however there is No reason for weapons like AR-15’s bump-stocks . And might I  add that your inane bullshit is tiring and old!
3781 2018-02-15 10:53:45 The money given to politicians from the NRA is the problem, we cant even get legislation for bump stocks! There is no conflation, NRA money is blood money, and gun control is needed, enough is enough.
3782 2018-02-15 10:53:45 For the most part that’s true but there are gap downs-earnings,unforeseen issues Etc. Biotech’s drug stocks notorious

3793 2018-02-15 10:49:54 That’s an overly emotional reaction.

Unless you feel that every citizen should have an unlimited right to own & brandish any type of armament, the question then is one of degree.

Did original framers account for semi-automatic weapons with high capacity magazines? Bump stocks?
3794 2018-02-15 10:48:54 Why do you think G Bush let his membership go? I agree we need other solutions but we need to be more proactive with taking on NRA eg bump stocks and semi automatic weapons and high capacity magazines

3800 2018-02-15 10:46:50 No single action will solve all the shootings so stop using that argument. Using that same logic we shouldn’t have any laws because they don’t stop all crime. If we can stop one or two future mass shootings it’s worth it. We don’t need assault rifles, don’t need bump stocks.

3809 2018-02-15 10:41:25 Laws banning semi-automatic weapons and devices like bump stocks would at least make it more difficult for people to obtain the types of weapons used in mass shootings. There is no reason for civilians (law abiding or otherwise) to have semi-automatic weapons.

3816 2018-02-15 10:34:33 Honestly, anyone saying that the government/we as a nation cant do anything about mass shootings and gun violence is either selfish or a pussy. Literally anything proposed (even stuff that's reasonable like banning bump-stocks) has been shut down by the right and its infuriating.

No.

3825 2018-02-15 10:30:02 Please reference the shootings where a bump stock was used. If you watch Youtube videos you will see how extremely inaccurate bump stocks make a rifle. I watched a Marine hit 3/30 shots with bump fire and 28/30 on semi auto.

3834 2018-02-15 10:23:36 It's just good common sense that citizens don't need semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, etc. these people who are terrified of having their arsenals taken away, or simply over-reacting.

3840 2018-02-15 10:20:09 You're a man with a great deal of reach. Instead of plattitudes let's start formulating a plan. First up for me-ban assault rifles and bump stocks.

3844 2018-02-15 10:19:30 Good point, it should not be leagl to have any semi-automatic. And just fyi, it just needs "selective fire" to be an assault rifle, and the AR15 *has* selective fire. Add one of those (still legal) lovely bump stocks like the LV guy and it's basically full-auto.

3849 2018-02-15 10:16:56 Congress NEVER passed a law outlawing M16 bump stocks after Las Vegas. Congress couldnt even have the balls to do that. Bump Stocks make an automatic weapon out of a semi-automatic weapon. They would not outlaw bump stocks even though it is ILLEGAL to possess an automatic weapon.
3850 2018-02-15 10:14:33 I did well in econ. Do you remember the stock market 1600-1700 when the dutch came together to get funding for their projects. No stocks are not a currency, but you can still make money off of them

3854 2018-02-15 10:12:43 Because they do need to make some changes.  They keep denying it.   Banning semi automatic weapons and bump stocks needs to be done, they were not always allowed.  Stronger checks for past records of violence and mental illness also.  Why is this a problem?  It shouldn't be.
3855 2018-02-15 10:12:28 I’ll only eat at restaurants that put the kids in stocks as soon as they walk in & if they offer keel hauling as a extra, fantastic

3863 2018-02-15 10:08:41 Oh, I don’t know. How about universal background checks so that our gun laws are actually enforced? How about outlawing bump stocks? Those aren’t even controversial (among the vast majority of Americans, including gun owners).  That would be a nice minimal way to start.

3866 2018-02-15 10:08:24 I like his approach of valuing the market from first principles. Much lazy first order thinking elsewhere,  Pick 1 variable ( CAPE),  compare  to the past and announce the apocalypse. His conclusion is like Buffett's - stocks reasonable at these levels in this environment.

3872 2018-02-15 10:04:28 Best defense is a good offense. Thst means more than an AR. Hand gun, element of surprise, a security system...an ice-pick would do the trick if planned well. Its the AR in the hand of a bad actor thats danerous. AR isan un-defensible weapon. No need for bump stocks eith BTW
3873 2018-02-15 10:04:11 I haven’t read the article, but other sovereign money proposals that I am aware of are unnecessary and unworkable. Tighter regulation is what is required in my view. Money stocks and flows are endogenous; banks respond to private money demand, CBs supply base money as required.

3887 2018-02-15 09:53:40 The Las Vegas shooter used 24 guns  to fire off 1100 rounds in killing 58 people attending a concert. Included were 14 AR-15 rifles modified with bump fire stocks. I know it’s only been 4 months. Is it too soon to kick that one around?

3904 2018-02-15 09:46:22 Yeah, errrr, no. AR15 *is* an assault rifle and of course it *is* perfectly leagl to buy one, just not an automatic one. So you just get a couple of bump-stocks, like the guy in LV.

3912 2018-02-15 09:43:13 You‘re missing the point. Thats how gun control works. Process can be applied to high-capacity, high powered, semi-auto, silencers, bump-stocks, drugs, alcohol.. criminalising something severely enough makes the price go up.

3916 2018-02-15 09:40:57 Once you ban bump stocks, will you regulate how fast someone can shoot?  You don't need a bump stock to increase fire rate. It's really just a technique anyone can master.

3951 2018-02-15 09:16:47 So you want to invest in the stock market by picking individual stocks or let your banker advise you? Don't!

3952 2018-02-15 09:16:01 Are we back to point where month end flows (tiny give relative difference) are selling stocks to buy bonds?
3953 2018-02-15 09:15:38 Yep safe haven plus dollar selling off. Dollar downtrend still in place and dip-buyers in stocks. Idea now that inflation could kill off consumer spending and weigh on the growth rebound, which wouldn't mean more rate rises.

3986 2018-02-15 08:50:56 do you have the consensus profit figure estimates before it reported like you did with some of the other stocks?
3987 2018-02-15 08:50:53 Bump stocks makes a gun almost unusable. Aiming is impossible. And they still don't fire much faster than a regular semi automatic. How have they gotten more accessible?  Most gun laws are recent occurrences. I suppose you could argue that there are more guns.
3988 2018-02-15 08:50:42 It took tragedies in Australia and the UK to prompt gun law reform, and in both countries it worked. I thought Sandy Hook would be that for America. It wasn't. Even Vegas couldn't prompt restrictions on bump-stocks.

3991 2018-02-15 08:49:00 Bump stocks were approved by the Obama administration. 

In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, the NRA spoke out in favor of regulating bump stocks. 

To recap:

Obama made them legal
The NRA is pushing for their regulation

Is that how you’re framing this narrative?
3992 2018-02-15 08:48:31 We can't even get bump stocks or armor piercing rounds banned. Who wears armor? Cops.  I thought blue lives mattered...

3994 2018-02-15 08:47:55 But they yet to ban lettuce.  They try to make sure future lettuce wont make us sick... As we should these guns.  No hi cap mags. No bump stocks. No quick change mag options would be a great start and make the AR like any other semi auto target or hunting rifle.
3995 2018-02-15 08:47:33 Markets are expensive, interest rates will increase, fiscal policy will increase deficits and debt level, ...most probably there will have to be a correction in stocks during 2018 or 2019.
3996 2018-02-15 08:47:07 @meinincubator sir one more clarification. While playing intra  breakouts and breakdowns on stocks. Is it necessary to track nifty as well ? I mean does nifty influence (much) on stocks or to go full on with stocks not considering anything ?
3997 2018-02-15 08:46:53 South Carolina passed a law about bump stocks, but repealed it a month later.

3999 2018-02-15 08:46:26 Come on, you know how the right is in this country. They'll do anything to protect their guns. Even small upgrades to the current system like background checks or ban of bump stocks is too much to ask. And you know they'll say "Don't use tragedy for policy".
4000 2018-02-15 08:46:26 Already out of stocks.  Sayang namaaan. Di ako naka-order kahit isa. 
4001 2018-02-15 08:45:47 There's no need to ban guns.  If you go talking like that, then you've lost this entire argument.  I know as well as I know the back of my hand, the states wouldn't accept that and I wouldn't accept it either.  Be reasonable and get rid of the semi automatic and bump stocks.

4014 2018-02-15 08:37:57 Property stocks have been in meandos (really love this word) since EOH tumbled in December due to collateral calls. They also suffered contagion from the Steinhoff matter & haven't recovered. My reading anyway
4015 2018-02-15 08:37:35 You don’t think there were “crazy” disaffected misfits 30, 40 years ago? Before the proliferation of semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks and the deification of all things 2A? What could be the difference now, I wonder...
4016 2018-02-15 08:36:53 In Britain and Europe we don’t need security to be as good as airports because the access to guns is so low. It would be a start if you stoped supplying automatic rifles and you have got them with bump stocks to idiots.

But why not mitigate the risk as much as possible with background checks and bans on semi-automatic rifes and bump stocks?

4054 2018-02-15 08:11:06 Yes, all of these, but stricter. Longer cooling off period. Harsher punishment. More rules for licencing and more expense involved. Including gun, reg, lic and ammo. No semi or auto and none of those add on stocks.

4060 2018-02-15 08:08:09 Hmm I was not aware of this. I knew that rocker triggers (similar concept to bump stocks) are illegal in my state, so I guess I made an assumption. I very much support this point that bump stocks should be illegal. I feel differently about AR's if youd like to discuss that
4061 2018-02-15 08:08:05 Is it to soon still to talk about bump stocks after the Vegas shooting?  How much ducking time do you need before you realize there is a semi automatic weapon problem in this country?
4062 2018-02-15 08:07:46 I agree, will take time. Ban anything automatic / semi automatic immediately. Including bump stocks. Leave only single shot hand guns and hunting rifles for now. Give it ten years, then come after the rest. Civilians do not need weapons, especially automatic ones.
4063 2018-02-15 08:07:43 Wrong ban AR 15 & semi auto & bump stocks & mentally ill  buying, better universal background checks & registration
4064 2018-02-15 08:05:47 #stocks, FOR BEGINNERS:  Stop, look around, do your own research, find the cheapest brokers, and invest incrementally in stocks with a proven track record.of dividend growth. Greed is the heady elixir seducing you to make stupid moves.
4065 2018-02-15 08:04:20 They can't get bump stocks outlawed. They can't even keep guns away from suspected terrorists that are kept off airplanes. That's the low hanging fruit. But you don't want to hear any of that, or fact that no other western country has this problem - they all have sane laws.
4066 2018-02-15 08:04:07 Dude i just put a number out there. I believe we should ban semis and bump stocks because it has proven time and time again to do only evil and no good. Hunting rifles can feed families, pistols can give personal protection. Semis are used for senseless murder
4067 2018-02-15 08:04:03 Were these AR15s and similar assault guns not banned from 1994 to 2004? Its time to ban or severely limit these again along with bump stocks.  

How about it ? Time for some common sense

4079 2018-02-15 08:00:49 Assault rifle - semi-automatic. I am not an “anti-gun nut”, but most responsible gun owners I know say large-magazine semi-automatic rifles aren’t needed. Ban them. Ban bump stocks. Don’t allow people that are deemed mentally unfit to handle their affairs to own guns.

4095 2018-02-15 07:50:58 Actually, if you do your research there is a loophole in the NFA(1986)  that doesn't clearly define these devices & the ATF has stated it doesn't have the authority to address bump stocks, hence the push for  HR 4168 (Loophole Act) in congress last fall to ban their sale.

4097 2018-02-15 07:50:49 I meant that anything that means they have to stop selling guns, to anyone, for any reason, is unthinkable. They wouldn’t even restrict bump stocks and they’re not even guns. There’s heaps of sensible options and not one thing will be done. I haaaate it.

My Dad knows two of the founders, one was a former boss and the other was a college.
4101 2018-02-15 07:50:08 so addressing the high capacity assault weapons with/without bump stocks is a no-go?
4102 2018-02-15 07:49:28 The GOP wants to regulate my uterus because they are “pro-life” except they aren’t because they have proved time and again they are ok with children being murdered with AR15s augmented w/ bump stocks for maximum kills.

4108 2018-02-15 07:44:58 What possible good reason is there for not banning the AR-15 for starters? These weasels abandoned even the minimal step of banning bump stocks as soon as the NRA told them to. Just because NRA values sales over kids' lives doesn't mean Congress has to play along.
4109 2018-02-15 07:44:00 Bump stocks are considered an automatic modification, which is illegal

4114 2018-02-15 07:41:12 Universal background checks, Banning AR-15 and bump stocks. Close the boyfriend loophole for DV preclusion.
4115 2018-02-15 07:40:48 It won't get rid of it completely but it'll visibly reduce signs of the cracking.  Also doing lotion soaks with cheap throw away dollar store stocks once or twice a month helps too
4116 2018-02-15 07:40:08 I believe the general population does not need military assault weapons or multiple magazines for them. Bump stocks, no. The military needs them to kill the enemy. Regular people do not need them. A regular hand gun should be just fine to protect yourself.
4117 2018-02-15 07:39:48 Circular stated only for stocks. I am not holding any positions in stocks. All in indices where MWPL will never cross 60%.
4118 2018-02-15 07:38:52 That's nice sweetie.  Now check the stats.  Are most of Gen X able to say the same? No.  And it's not because of internet stocks.  It's because selfish Boomers raised college tuitions & the retirement age with no thoughts regarding how that would affect the future.
4119 2018-02-15 07:38:37 The #yen extended an advance and a rally in global stocks continued in Asia as equity investors showed signs of warming to a world with inflation and a sustained pace of tightening in U.S. monetary policy following this month’s slide in risk assets. @business

4121 2018-02-15 07:37:03 So the NRA sells Bump Stocks to get around that law.
4122 2018-02-15 07:35:52 No.we should have mandatory background checks, no bump stocks, no 80% receivers.
I've seen what guns can do up close my friend.
I'm a responsible gun owner.
I'm scared of the ones who are careless. Peeps are stupid. And the ones that get by are the ones I worry about.
4123 2018-02-15 07:35:44 There's our elected representatives doing something about the enormous loss of life in the form of a ban on assault rifles, or bump stocks, or even an age limit, SOMETHING, 
..& there's your "rational argument".
That's it!! I'm sick & tired of people that want to debate about it

4130 2018-02-15 07:31:35 They are watching the news every day, hearing about people making $ and 10-50% daily gains they never earned in stocks. Everyday people want to buy, they’re just scared of losing money. Moving up makes them feel safe.
4131 2018-02-15 07:30:27 It’s not even just guns we have to regulate. we should firstly put major restrictions on bump stocks, things you can put on semi automatic rifles to make them shoot like automatic weapons (which are illegal). Those things are a huge problem and a way for ppl to cheat the system
4132 2018-02-15 07:30:15 Background check.
Ban 80% receivers. Bump Stocks. 30 round magazines.
I own guns.these shootings make me want to cry, rage, and destroy those that want to perpetrate this.
All the responsible gun owners want Change. NRA Is a joke.
Wish I had a way to make it better.

4135 2018-02-15 07:28:37 People like you & me work our butt off & get our salaries deducted at source. Worms like these in connivance with bank officials loot our money. Now the bank stocks have nose dived; this is a double whammy.
4136 2018-02-15 07:28:12 It’s so sad that politicians haven’t been able to solve this problem. I hate to say this but I’m just wondering how long before the next mass shooting.  Las Vegas was the last one I remember and bump stocks are still legal.  Crazy stuff!!!

4143 2018-02-15 07:22:12 And when the Vegas shooting happened you were all for banning bump stocks. Is this a new trend? Aren't you having the same knee jerk reacting you so casually accuse us of? Banning ammunition & accessories is not the answer everytime we have a shooting tragedy.
4144 2018-02-15 07:22:03 It’s amazing that bump stocks are still legal after Las Vegas.  I doubt anything will ever be done.
4145 2018-02-15 07:21:15 Time to return your fat checks from the NRA and clean up the automatic weapons and oversized magazine.  Oh. Yes. Don't neglect the bump stocks.

4151 2018-02-15 07:19:47 Bombs explode, but is one explosion usuallyresulting in a suicide bombing.

Trucks go in one direction. Will hit and kill some, but at a slower rate than a semi automatic with bump stocks that make them automatic.
4152 2018-02-15 07:19:44 Education,not arguing or trolling. 
Lots of bird hunters use semi-automatic shotguns.
Very common. 
Some hunters use semi-auto rifles.
Also,persons w disabilities (amputees,paralysis etc)can't operate a bolt,lever or pump action rifle.
Semi-auto isn't useless. 
Bump-stocks are.
4153 2018-02-15 07:19:34 While stocks last.
4154 2018-02-15 07:19:24 I think they should be banned as well as bump stocks.  I was raised with guns also and my brother is a collector.  There's no practical use for them and they weren't always legal.
4155 2018-02-15 07:19:15 today's tita topic: insurance, investments, and stocks 
4156 2018-02-15 07:18:48 The slower the better,may his discomfort increases he is flayed in the stocks.
4157 2018-02-15 07:18:38 They ARE unsafe with WMDs available: semi-automatics, bump stocks, high-capacity magazines. Only use: massacres.
GOP substituting prayers for common-sense gun control is why US is only nation w/ mass-shootings. Every day you don't call for gun control, you've blood on your hands.
4158 2018-02-15 07:17:38 South African stocks gain most since June 2016 as Pres. Zuma quits !
4159 2018-02-15 07:17:31 Okay, let's put bump stocks aside. "Assault Rifles" designs are also all about capacity for a high rate of fire. Magazine sizes, minimised time between rounds firing, stability grips...
4160 2018-02-15 07:17:27 So my professor just spent almost 15K dollars of his own money to teach us how buying stocks work 
4161 2018-02-15 07:16:45 Twitter stocks at $33!

They were $25 last week. 

30%+ gains? Damn.
4162 2018-02-15 07:16:37 (2/2) and my husband has been trained with a gun. My children are unaware of the locked guns in our home. AR-15s, bump stocks and high powered rifles should be removed from all civilian hands entirely. I respect 2A, but there needs to be limits. I’m a dem in California (2/2)
4163 2018-02-15 07:16:14 Oh and throw in a couple of bump stocks, they’re still legal...
4164 2018-02-15 07:15:55 Hmm... Hope we indians are not made as a laughing stocks... Loopholes in IPC, scoot off b4 FIR, minimal punishments for grave offence, auditors are dealers of corruption, but yes a govt is ruling the country with a majority.

Vegas shooter showed no sign and we still don't know his m.o.Lets at least start w renewing ban on Assault Rifle like AR'15s, bump stocks, large mags, silencers. Mitigate the carnage not guarantee its huge count. Report troubled kids to police
4167 2018-02-15 07:14:19 Calling for banning these rifles, bump stocks and deterrents for people with mental illness/violent pasts is common sense.  They weren't always legal.  Every shooting has involved them recently.  This kid, what could they have done but get him out..he'd not done anything prior?
4168 2018-02-15 07:14:07 U.S. bank stocks rally, analysts see more upside
4169 2018-02-15 07:13:04 Because a lot of US states already ban bump stocks. (But of course that doesn't stop that interstate gun-show loophole.)
4170 2018-02-15 07:11:57 18 school shootings in the last 35 days! OUR government needs to step up and do something. Still no movement on bump stocks.
4171 2018-02-15 07:11:38 @JeffFlake No need for AR15and those mega clips. This can change things. No bump stocks. There is more than this that can be done as well. Get on it...we are pissed and sick of nra payments blocking any legislation. Protect our kids

4176 2018-02-15 07:10:34 All gun purchases must be registered. Require all purchasers to take and pass a gun safety class. Ban bump stocks.
4177 2018-02-15 07:10:30 You know to be fair thinking about it just alittle bit, Gun Control created bumb stocks.... which is why I wonder why making more legislation like a ban would do any good.

4195 2018-02-15 07:04:57 The sales of bump stocks which turn semiautomatic firearms into automatic firearms should be banned. The notion that you can’t do it because it violates on the 2nd amendment is nonsense. There are already heavy restrictions on automatic firearms.

4198 2018-02-15 07:02:48 When they banned Thompson submachine guns from private ownership, that took care of that problem. They need to ban AR-15s and bump stocks. That should take care of most wacko mass-killings.
4199 2018-02-15 07:02:40 Bans on assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. Universal background checks. Mandatory waiting periods. Gun buy-back programs. We have got to try to do SOMETHING.  Most of the country favors gun control.

Great sign of strength. Pay attention when stks go up on bad news, or down on good news
4208 2018-02-15 06:58:39 Lol. They did the last time this came up also. What they don’t understand is I’m not opposed 2 the second.

4209 2018-02-15 06:58:25 are y really sure of that? f.e. in forex, there are so called "price runs" when big player collaborate to run a pair and in small cap land there a operators that pump&dump low float stocks

4217 2018-02-15 06:54:54 Nobody needs high capacity magazines. Nobody needs semi-automatic rifles for that matter. And bump-stocks are ***still legal***
4218 2018-02-15 06:54:42 There are "hunting" rifles that have the same magazine capacity as an AR-15. Without the 30 round magazine, an AR is just a big ass gun. Eliminate the high capacity magazines, bump stocks, and any model that can be modified to be an auto.

And deal with the mental health issues.

4224 2018-02-15 06:51:45 Depends on how you define "bump stocks" - friends of mine who are experts in this branch of law point out that most proposed bans would literally make it a crime to own both a rifle and shoelaces.

4226 2018-02-15 06:50:31 The point is functionally fireable stability. And that's what you get with fully automatic weapons of any kind, machine guns are not precision tools.

Do you agree that bump-stocks should be entirely illegal? And it's suspect that certain rifle designs seem tailor made for them?

4236 2018-02-15 06:46:13 Bump stocks are slightly more precise than a shoelace, but not much; you're not going to really be aiming past the first round no matter what.
4237 2018-02-15 06:45:34 You know which stocks are going to be rising tomorrow in the U.S. market...? The gun manufacturer companies. Coincidentally, gun purchases will be high in the next couple of days. It's a sick system.
4238 2018-02-15 06:41:39 Nowhere in this entire thread did Amanda say “assault rifle” or “automatic rifle”.

In fact, the first time it popped up on my view is when you said it.

There is a HUUUGE difference between an AR-15 & a bolt action hunting rifle. And that’s not even accounting for bump stocks.

4242 2018-02-15 06:40:31 Not... entirely accurate. Bump stocks are specifically designed that they maintain grip points of stability. Yes, this essentially makes the gun into the moving part, but it's not 'bouncing around'.

4244 2018-02-15 06:40:13 Just heard an interesting stat on msnbc. A million and a half AR- 15s R sold every year in America. The bump stocks  that R still legal to sell in 47 states, can turn a semi auto into a full automatic assault weapon which is illegal. Rs have had plenty of time 2 ban bump stocks.
4245 2018-02-15 06:39:13 A R rep in IL tried to ban bump stocks and even was supported by local gun organizations, but anti gun reps oppose it!?!?! Why???
4246 2018-02-15 06:39:10 GOP couldn’t even manage to ban bump stocks after Vegas. The only thing GOP did manage to bump is the ticker stock of gun manufacturers and the NRA.
4247 2018-02-15 06:39:04 Also make bump stocks illegal I'm fine with that I'll never own one or want to own one like I said they are a pointless piece that dems and the msm are using for illegal gun grabs

4253 2018-02-15 06:36:38 Marco, if only we could magically transport school shooters home, to inside NRA headquarters... I would support their right to bump stocks - just like you do!
4254 2018-02-15 06:36:23 GOP couldn’t even manage to ban bump stocks after Vegas; the NRA has a strict zero tolerance policy towards any regulation. Ryan, McConnell , Paul, Trump and fellow GOP are submissive and obey.
4255 2018-02-15 06:35:14 Accuracy is meaningless to someone shooting in a ground of hundreds or thousands of people in a closed space. They will hit people, so they will want to fire as quickly as they can.

For others, they serve no purpose. Tbus, ban bump stocks.
4256 2018-02-15 06:34:36 50% of Americans own no stocks, and do not have a pension or investment vehicle invested in the stock market. All you and Trump do is talk about the Dow, when the problem for us is OBSCENE income inequality and stagnant wages for decades.
4257 2018-02-15 06:34:00 No, it proves my point. If someone wants to kill or injure as many people as possible, they will want a gun that is as fast as they can get. Bump stocks cost ~$400.

They shoot faster, more bullets = more chaos = greater chances of making hits.

After Las Vegas they waited past the grieving period to outlaw bump stocks. And now that Parkland has happened our leaders will do what they’ve always done. Zilch.

4279 2018-02-15 06:24:53 Oh Yeah, remember bump stocks? of course it's about guns or do lunatics only exist in the US?
4280 2018-02-15 06:24:37 I've probably been shooting guns longer than you've been alive. Bump stocks are springs that hit the shoulder bouncing the stock past the trigger hitch point and allow it to fire at an incredible rate. Silencers suppress sound and restrict the noise of shots fired. Meant to kill.
4281 2018-02-15 06:24:31 No loopholes for gun shows. Parents bear legal responsibility if their children kill with their guns. No bump stocks. Limits on capacity of clips.

4286 2018-02-15 06:23:04 Also, look at charts.  In addition you should know the fundamentals- the finacials of the company.  Read books by people who discuss how Warren Buffet finds value stocks. Learn his formula.
4287 2018-02-15 06:22:20 After a mass murder of kids the biggest political shift was: people decided that sandy hook was staged by the government to take people's guns. 

Hundreds were shot at a country show and bump stocks are more popular than ever. 

Add #FloridaShooting to the list.
4288 2018-02-15 06:22:11 Pain levels so high now I’ve become irritable, nauseas & can’t concentrate. All Chemists I’ve spoken to are still out of codeine, meaning all those with a prescription must go without until stocks are refilled. So I’m headed home to cry a little. #rheum
4289 2018-02-15 06:21:56 The guy in Vegas had 50 guns. 15 of them AR-15s with bump stocks. Didn't raise an eyebrow because there's no comprehensive registration or oversight.

He fired one, tossed it aside, fired the next, tossed it aside, and so on.
That helped him kill 60 people.
4290 2018-02-15 06:21:47 I didn't get a bonus but I work for the national government.  My 401k is doing great and stocks too but that's just ongoing from the past decade. The correction last week sucked pretty bad though.
4291 2018-02-15 06:20:46 Bump stocks wouldn't be used for most people as you said it is inaccurate. However, it is faster. That is fact.
4292 2018-02-15 06:20:42 Bump stocks aren't illegal. There aren't even background checks in Florida. You can buy an AK 15 at any gun show.
4293 2018-02-15 06:20:27 There are MANY. Universal background checks, ban high capacity magazines, ban online ammo sales, ban bump stocks, register guns ( you know like we do cars ) ban military style weapons, require rigorous testing for conceal carry permits. Those are a few to start the discussion.

4296 2018-02-15 06:17:16 How’s about banning assault rifles and bump stocks, dammit. Background checks for those who buy guns. I had to get to one to conceal carry and one to teach your kids! I didn’t complain! If you have nothing to hide you wouldn’t worry.
4297 2018-02-15 06:16:26 $FIZZ Still one of the most amazing stocks I have ever seen
4298 2018-02-15 06:15:09 Today stocks gain sharply; EUR/USD 1,2465; bund yield 0.758%; Brent $64.86; gold $1353.2 Watch: Eurozone foreign trade; Spain CPI; speeches by ECB's Mersch, Praet
4299 2018-02-15 06:14:51 They should stand in front of the parents and explain why they won't vote for bans on military grade weapons and bump stocks.
4300 2018-02-15 06:13:02 @BloombergRadio #DaybreakEurope: @chepker : Tell your guest that Stocks & Bonds are moving in opposite directions in an abnormal way...
4301 2018-02-15 06:12:54 I only want to ban semi-autos. Keep the handguns and bolt action rifles, pump shotguns. Ban bump stocks, mandatory checks and stiff fines for all sellers on all forums not obeying the law. It’s a start 
4302 2018-02-15 06:12:52 P.S I don't think #cartel will let it pass $10K at this point in time. Right now trap people to think it's climbing. Then crash the market again to pick up more $BTC and other stocks.

4305 2018-02-15 06:12:11 ..... a machine gun was not used... it was semiautomatic rifles retrofitted with bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
4306 2018-02-15 06:12:03 Hi Assad , any examples of stocks etf or miners I could check out?  Thx.
4307 2018-02-15 06:11:46 Why AR-15s? One can do what an AR does with ANY other semi-automatic rifle. One can change a 20 bullet MAGAZINE as quickly as a 30. Bump stocks are hardly ever used by anyone. And Creedence Clearwater Revival has never killed anyone. However, CCR only makes sense!
4308 2018-02-15 06:10:50 da sind wir mit dran! Eine Krypto und Stocks App kommt bald!
4309 2018-02-15 06:09:20 Bump stocks make them automatic weapons
4310 2018-02-15 06:08:47 Sad that it won’t be!  NRA is a stupid and worthless organization!  The federal government should fully control the NRA and make it impossible for kids and adults to get bump stocks and rifles as this shooter used to kill innocent kids.  Nra should be ashamed!  Sad!
4311 2018-02-15 06:08:38 2)
I also have a problem with the loopholes that allow people, like the murderer today, to get guns (of any type) without background checks.

I also have a problem with the inaction in Congress. What happened to the legislation over bump stocks? 3 weeks after Vegas it, too, died.
4312 2018-02-15 06:06:46 u know what the saddest part about shopping is???? its when they dont have your size and their stocks are mostly composed of sizes larger than yours huhu
4313 2018-02-15 06:05:35 It was already reported on practically every mage news outlet the shooter at Vegas had over a dozen guns in his hotel room, with multiple having bump stocks. The one used had it.
4314 2018-02-15 06:04:49 Magazine size is not the problem. Neither are pistol grips, bump stocks, or bullet button magazine releases. The gun problem here is a responsibility issue. Nearly anybody can get a gun anywhere and we have a horrible lack of mental healthcare. We need to grow up and fix this.
4315 2018-02-15 06:03:45 We know this, but the industry makes bump stocks, high capacity magazines specific for the AR15... It's the choice for militant nutjobs, kind of like the H2 Hummer....
..
4316 2018-02-15 06:03:44 Don't know about David, but I would ban AR-15's, high capacity clips and bump stocks for starters. I also would make sure the CCR never sees the light of day. Don't bother with a snarky reply.
4317 2018-02-15 06:03:43 @jayjackets Geez, you've really exposed how little you know about firearms but continue to double down. You're wrong. Assault weapons have been banned since 1986. I'm for banning bump stocks though.
4318 2018-02-15 06:02:59 I'm aware. I'm not against making bump stocks illegal.

4321 2018-02-15 06:01:35 The question you have to ask is: why can’t red state politicians even discuss banning assault rifles or bump stocks without fear of being voted out by their constituents? Why is common sense gun control political suicide? This is about more than just NRA donations.
4322 2018-02-15 06:00:53 @dare2dream2dare alright so hear me out: we set the stocks to 3 and enable customs. Fox becomes top tier from his 0% kill confirms, bayo and cloud don't get any customs so they have to work harder for their kills, villager is viable and annoying again, the other DLCs can suck it
4323 2018-02-15 06:00:12 Agree about age limitations. And bump stocks (although I hadn’t heard that was part of this). Still, Utah has allowed teachers and staff to be armed for years without any untoward incidents/accidents, and zero invader horror stories, as I recall. Maybe threat of violence deters.

4328 2018-02-15 05:58:42 When our founding fathers conceived the idea, arms consisted of muzzle loaders that were often unreliable and took a minute btwn shots. Their intention was not for you to own semi-automatic assault rifles w/ laser sights, bump stocks, hollow pts, etc to make death more likely
4329 2018-02-15 05:58:05 Sir,  one question,  these 100 stocks should be from Nifty 100 stocks or it should be sector wise random stocks?
4330 2018-02-15 05:57:50 How r u going to help #45? How r u going to change our gun laws, teach about gun safety, make schools safer, ban AR-15's, ban bump stocks, keep the mentally ill frm buying these items. Make the 2nd Amend what it's supposed to be. Hunting, protecting, etc U don't need them for tht

4334 2018-02-15 05:56:27 It is quite likely that this means was used to convert black into white and also use the money for speculation - derivatives/stocks and of course, real estate!
4335 2018-02-15 05:56:14 How much do you have to buy stocks?

How many dollars did you buy last night when it was at R11.66?

Who really benefits from such?
4336 2018-02-15 05:56:11 True.
They said it wasn't the time to talk about bump-stocks!!!
When is the time???
4337 2018-02-15 05:55:31 Durr. You can, however, legally buy AR-15s and bump stocks separately and, ta da! You have the favorite weapon of all discerning mass murderers! At least you tried.
4338 2018-02-15 05:54:55 Well hey you know after Las Vegas bump stocks are still Legal.

4341 2018-02-15 05:54:21 Stocks & yields & Gold up too.  Interesting to say the least
4342 2018-02-15 05:53:33 False bump stocks do not change rate of fire. Only way a bump stock works is if you know how to use it which takes much practice it is a rythem you must master also makes gun incredibly inaccurate
4343 2018-02-15 05:53:25 HAHAHA. they’re adding stocks slowly from what I know. Alam ko yung mga pen at some shirts are still available but that was days ago when I looked 
4344 2018-02-15 05:53:08 Most people will agree, it’s the bump stocks and assault weapons that need to go. I’ve never known a hunter that needs more than a rifle or a arrow to hunt!
4345 2018-02-15 05:52:54 Or ask our representatives to do anything. Literally anything at all. We didn’t even ban bump stocks from Las Vegas.
4346 2018-02-15 05:52:21 Trading volume in bonds also dramatically exceeds stock market volume, with nearly $700 billion in bonds traded on a daily basis. That compares to about $200 billion per day in volume for stocks, according to data from industry group SIFMA.
4347 2018-02-15 05:52:20 The following is used for hunting.  bump stocks, automatic weapons, high capacity magazines and WMD's
4348 2018-02-15 05:52:13 Universal background checks, licenses, firearm proficiency tests, and a ban on AR-15s and bumper stocks would be a great start.

4350 2018-02-15 05:51:51 He didn't use the bump fire stocks in rhe actual shooting I thought. He used illegally modified guns due to the faster rate of fire and easier control.
4351 2018-02-15 05:51:36 psshhh...come...we all know $>innocent lives...but hey as least gun manufacturers will see a nice little uptick in their stocks...you just gotta find the positives in things(god this country sucks sorry for the pessimism)
4352 2018-02-15 05:51:28 You're full of crap.  You haven't done anything about bump stocks for that matter either.   You're waiting for your next round of NRA blood money is all.

4359 2018-02-15 05:50:14 Most investors will have a much harder time than he and Mr Buffett did in making money from stocks, he said, “but I’m about to die and you aren’t. You don’t want to trade your position for mine.”

4365 2018-02-15 05:48:24 Summary:  your world of stocks should be different if the holding period is 2 years vs 10 years..
4366 2018-02-15 05:47:59  we hate their love of Russia, and their failure to consider even small gun safety measures after tiny children were killed in Newtown, and bump stocks were used in Vegas. It’s disturbing. This sledgehammer dude could benefit from a visit to the psychiatrist
4367 2018-02-15 05:47:38 What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for? Ban assault weapons now not later. Stricter gun laws are needed now not later! Then again what are we to expect from a big game hunter himself!! Bump stocks still available?! What R U waiting for??

4370 2018-02-15 05:45:21 Arming security guards solely is not a solution. How can you trust the security guard? Throwing more guns at the issue is not a solution. It’s multi faceted, gun control(background checks, ammo limits, bump stocks) had to be part of the equation in addition to mental health ed.
4371 2018-02-15 05:45:11 EXACTLY !!! So we NEED to get rid of the guns that they use to commit those murders Like AR-15 & bump stocks
4372 2018-02-15 05:45:02 Banning assault weapons, bump stocks, etc may not stop these attacks, but it may reduce the carnage!

#BanAssaultWeaponsNow
4373 2018-02-15 05:43:46 @SenToomey Are you comfortable with the 10s of thousands you've received from the @NRA? Are you comfortable with their unbending refusal of all sensible gun laws--including bans on gun stocks and AR-15s like the one used in FL today--because it will cut into their profits?
4374 2018-02-15 05:43:45 Clarke is a worthless excuse for a human being. This is the exact same thing he said after the Vegas shooting. Anything change regarding bump stocks? Nope. What a cracker he is.
4375 2018-02-15 05:43:30 58 people were murdered in cold blood for no reason and the legislative reaction we got was /just barely/ banning bump stocks. Not even a gun, /a gun accessory./ would fewer public guns mean fewer mass shootings?
4376 2018-02-15 05:42:43 The NRA advocated the banning of fully automatic weapons. It also advocated banning bump stocks after Vegas and it's advocating tightening laws in Florida which has some series issues in the books.

4378 2018-02-15 05:42:07 @cadburysilk did so well in introducing the heart pop Silk to India on occasion of Valentine's Day but failed equally in ensuring distribution/ stocks ran out. This is very disappointing inspite of it being limited edition. Any explanation for this?
4379 2018-02-15 05:41:59 Sad but you are probably right. But I do think restricting access to AR 15 , AK 47s, bump stocks and large capacity magazines might mitigate some of the carnage.
4380 2018-02-15 05:41:31 Please watch the weapons stocks today and sales of AR15 rifles. The #bloodmoney runs right down Wall Street.

4385 2018-02-15 05:39:33 Also bump stocks are illegal in NY, but legal in Nevada, where the Vegas shooting happened where he used bump stocks to fire way quicker.
4386 2018-02-15 05:39:18 The NRA is so deeply entrenched in the Congress that they cant even ban Gun acessories  ex. Bump stocks much less anything else that involves weapons. Mentally ill people can even own guns. Letting civilians own Assault weapons is rediculous
4387 2018-02-15 05:38:46 1. Ban AR 15s cause no one needs them, they are for "fun".
2. Ban bump stocks cause no one needs those.
3. Require people to lock up their guns and take safety classes so children don't get access. 
4. Hold parents responsible if their kids kill with their guns.
4388 2018-02-15 05:38:24 I'm a proud gun owner. Right now, we only have the latter. It's time for #GunSense. Law-abiding citizens can easily obtain firearms and concealed carry permits. It's time to restore balance via universal bckgrnd checks, bans on hi-capacity mags, bump stocks, robust enforcement.

4390 2018-02-15 05:36:49 Thank you. Yet, even after @SpeakerRyan  promised,action on bump stocks, nothing happened. I agree, blue wave has to happen for any reasonable gun legislation.
4391 2018-02-15 05:36:22 And we do not need people in our government who do NOTHING, even about bump stocks.
4392 2018-02-15 05:36:13 AND WHEN IS A GOOD TIME?  prayer doesn't do anything! Let's put a plan together for some reasonable actions.
1. Ban AR 15s cause no one needs them
2. Ban bump stocks cause no one needs those
3. Require people to lock up their guns and take safety classes.
4393 2018-02-15 05:36:11 NOT ONE REPUBLICAN has co-sponsored the Feinstein bill to ban the sale/transfer/importation/

4394 2018-02-15 05:35:54 Just for the record;
We made so much fucking noise here in Massachusetts after the Los Vegas Massacre, that WE BANNED BUMP STOCKS.
NOT ONE OTHER STATE HAS HAD THE BALLS TO FOLLOW US.
Shame on everyone of those that stick their heads further up their Foxhole every time it happens.
4395 2018-02-15 05:35:29 That is the POINT,  when does any person need 30 rounds?   (or with a modded magazine like used in Las Vegas) over 100?  Or Bump Stocks?  WHY are those legal?  

When are you gonna use 30 rounds for an actual PURPOSE other than going to the range to get your jollys off?
4396 2018-02-15 05:34:47 Is it reasonable to limit the size of mags to 15? Is it reasonable to restrict bump fire stocks? Is it reasonable to have background checks that ACTUALLY block those with documented mental health issues, domestic violence charges from buying? Please explain your logic. PLEASE

4400 2018-02-15 05:33:35 In 1935, the US all but banned fully automatic weapons and started carefully tracking them and there hasn't been a mass shooting that used one of those weapons since.

Imagine if the us did the same thing for bump stocks and guns that are easily modified into fully automatics...
4401 2018-02-15 05:33:23 They don't own AR 15s with bump stocks.
4402 2018-02-15 05:33:17 I'll help them: require training and testing to buy weapons, registration accessible across states, trigger locks, bump stocks ban, loss of gun rights for domestic abusers & felons, high taxes on ammo, more money for school counselors & gun education, public shaming of NRA.
4403 2018-02-15 05:32:25 Nobody thinks we should get rid of *all* guns. Literally nobody ever says that. Gun control advocates want the middle group. Tighter rules on background checks, restrictions on assault type rifles, bump stocks, etc. They don’t want people’s hunting rifles or hand guns.
4404 2018-02-15 05:32:02 The fact that "Christians" support Trump, bump stocks are still legal, and one can buy an Ar-15 and 500 rounds is what's wrong.
4405 2018-02-15 05:31:47 Cut the funding of usa  business stops; gold rockets  stocks plummet america survives financial apocalypse we are the gold and the silver...like it says in a short story talked about on sundays
4406 2018-02-15 05:31:44 Tell me this donyou feel things like the ar "pistol" or AK "pistol" should exist? That is another example of something that just doesn't need to exist. Same with bump stocks.

4408 2018-02-15 05:30:56 so you have no fucking problem with bump stocks then
4409 2018-02-15 05:30:45 You and I both predicted it on MSCI and on IMF (both of whom should have known better), but the criteria on stocks ANYwhere - not just China - is always qualitative top-down (approve market or no) and quantitative bottom-up (market cap, float, etc). Once top-down is done...
4410 2018-02-15 05:30:41 You're thinking "safety".  A "Security Token" in our context is a tokenized representation of a real world asset like stocks, bonds, real estate, or commodities.
Some examples from these issuers: @22xFund, @blockchaincap, @tokenfunder, @SPiCE_VC, @Property_Coin, @vaultbankICO
4411 2018-02-15 05:30:29 And bump stocks thus cause them to fire faster than they would fire without them.
4412 2018-02-15 05:29:30 Sure, how about this. You give me back my MGs, SBRs, suppressors (all of these with no tax stamp) and no permit CC, and you can have bumps stocks. How’s that sound buckaroo? Oh, and we already have background checks. So that’s kinda, you know, POINTLESS.
4413 2018-02-15 05:29:29 You don’t OWN the business though you get a share of what they make because you put money into their company. And stocks can go either way, it’s essentially gambling and those sharks lose money as well as make.
4414 2018-02-15 05:29:29 Bump stocks are not that drastically difficult and are legal in most states.

Yes, some of those modifications make it less user friendly, but I don't think a mass shooter cares about their own life at that point.
4415 2018-02-15 05:29:26 Don't forget Steve scalise who got shot himself on a baseball field. And as I suspected last summer, the republicans'talk of bump stocks was a ruse. Those sell well. Profits over people
4416 2018-02-15 05:29:08 Tell me one semi-auto rifle that shoots 200 rounds per minute, and tell me one person that uses a rifle with a 200 round capacity to hunt deer. You've obviously never fired a weapon, let alone hunted. And there a tens of thousands of bump stocks in the US. How many used to kill?
4417 2018-02-15 05:28:12 elbow didn’t know that, huh) from ever going above that because BUMP STOCKS ARE STIIIIIIIILL LEGAL. So let me pose this question to you. Why In the world does 5/
4418 2018-02-15 05:28:02 They need to start by getting rid of Ghost Guns along with bump stocks.
4419 2018-02-15 05:27:57 And, at some point, do we need to sell assault rifles? Can we implement a program to use that shit at the range only? But we can’t even ban bump stocks.
4420 2018-02-15 05:27:45 You are right but they effectively made their judgement by admitting Chinese stocks when they admitted that China didn't meet most standard criteria. Just as IMF did the same and we see how that turned out
4421 2018-02-15 05:27:34 What is it going to take for the @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP  to move on some sensible gun control? Let's ban assault weapons, bump stocks, lax background checks and let's make our school safe. The GOP DOES want safe schools, don't they??
4422 2018-02-15 05:26:49 Current Outlook: CONFIRMED UPTREND (Day 1) @IBDinvestors #stocks
4423 2018-02-15 05:26:00 You do know you can legally purchase bump stocks... Nobody stood a chance in the slaughter in vegas..
4424 2018-02-15 05:25:54 Test to get a license (with retesting every few years), mandatory safety classes, registration and insurance, making bump stocks illegal. 

There's no way to know how many lives this could save. I'm not saying it'd stop a mass shooting. Think it's naive to say it'd have no impact
4425 2018-02-15 05:25:32 Please underatand that tbis has nothing to do with the GOP or Dems, guns, regulation, or bump stocks. It DOES; however, have everything to do with the piss poor resources available for those with mental health issues. People of sound mind do not act this way. (Co n't)...
4426 2018-02-15 05:25:28 I have no problem with bump stocks going away.  I don't know anybody who doesn't agree with that.
4427 2018-02-15 05:25:03 & bump stocks r still readily available to convert semi-automatics to automatics- & even semi-automatics like truly why do u need a gun that shoots 200 rounds per minute r u killing 200 deer per minute? No most people r using it to injure tens of people per minute
4428 2018-02-15 05:24:15 They are the 1% because they have the money, you think the money is physical, no it's not, it's in business, stocks, you own the stock you own the business
4429 2018-02-15 05:23:29 Corn getting stronger and bubble gazers still calling 4k or lower. Fuck off and go buy stocks cause you'll never buy a dip anyways.
4430 2018-02-15 05:23:06 I think the majority of Americans are perfectly OK with banning assault rifles. But the NRA won't even allow bump stocks to be banned. As long as our politicians cowtow to the NRA, nothing will be done.
4431 2018-02-15 05:22:39 So many 10% ROE stocks are today trading at 30 P/E, not sure which DCF model can justify that, even if there is margin expansion.
4432 2018-02-15 05:22:18 In the game cashflow, you buy stocks low, and sell them high, commodities are set to rally as stocks fall like a Bitcoin off 2000.
4433 2018-02-15 05:22:06 I meant that there was little/no resistance to the idea of banning bump stocks.
4434 2018-02-15 05:21:58 you should push for 4xm to use the best smash ruleset of 3 stocks 5 min

please its so much better
4435 2018-02-15 05:21:56 Well they don’t buy all the stocks first of all because they don’t invest in too many stocks at once because they’re busy investing in other businesses, second of all the pie never gets smaller because if it did they’d already have all the money. It’s there for you to grab.
4436 2018-02-15 05:21:39 High capacity magazines or full auto fire mods have no place in civilized society. The solution that needs to be put in place NOW, not later, is a ban on all mods that allow fully automatic fire (bump stocks) and a ban on magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. #floridashooting
4437 2018-02-15 05:21:33 Aussie market had its best day of the year. #ASX 200 +1.16% or +67.8pts to 5909. All sectors rose, with mining and financial stocks pushing market higher most #ausbiz
4438 2018-02-15 05:21:31 We need more sensible gun laws. Maybe we need to take some guns away. No more assault rifles, no more large magazines, no more bump stocks, etc. etc. etc. Ban the NRA as a terrorist organization.

4440 2018-02-15 05:20:36 @Lawrence @JoyAnnReid @chrislhayes @maddow  Please watch the weapons stocks today and sales of AR15 rifles. The #bloodmoney runs right down Wall Street.
4441 2018-02-15 05:20:22 I traded stocks back in the day with a 2% stop, if wrong and 5% stop if going my direction for profit.  Crypto is different.  figuring out my trading parameters.  Might be 2.75% stop, with 7-8% stop for profit.  Got to figure what works best for me.  Only in this for a month
4442 2018-02-15 05:19:38 Bump stocks are not illegal.  Congress mumbled about it in the wake of Las Vegas, but in the end DID NOTHING.
4443 2018-02-15 05:19:34 Thoughts and prayers will not stop gun violence Dems need to lead the way to safety Work with law enforcement Stop gun reciprocity! Start serious background checks Outlaw bump stocks & assault weapons Common sense must prevail Howmany more must die before we do the right thing?
4444 2018-02-15 05:19:17 And what happens when those sharks buy all the stocks, and control all the wealth? Because the rich get richer, and richer and richer, while the rest of us are left with a smaller pie, and no opportunity to climb out of the hole? Then what
4445 2018-02-15 05:18:46 what does constitution say about a well-regulated militia, again?

bump stocks
Nah - I'm good with handing out muskets to every citizen.
4446 2018-02-15 05:18:15 Drug companies have been down in the dumps after the State of the Union & last week's correction.

4447 2018-02-15 05:18:14 If you were truly concerned about America and if you are truly concerned with how ppl look at you as a president, step up & be a leader. Put in laws making it illegal to have bump stocks to rifles and make it impossible for those who have mental illness to obtain these weapons.
4448 2018-02-15 05:18:12 That’s just the least they can do! Ban assault weapons & bump stocks in every state!!
4449 2018-02-15 05:17:19 That might be a good idea.I'm in favor of universal background checks and such. I'd need to see some research on bump stocks.

4451 2018-02-15 05:16:46 Enough with the prayers. There is no need for this type of gun nor bump stocks. Please for once do the decent thing.
4452 2018-02-15 05:15:57 Since the Vegas Massacre, bump-stocks have been flying off the shelves at gun shows.  Gun culture is deeply ingrained among a large segment of the American populace.  It must be challenged!
4453 2018-02-15 05:15:53 I can agree with no full auto but that's already pretty much illegal. Since I haven't seen a mention of bump stock, I assume it wasn't used in this case. Bump stocks are garbage. Ban them.
4454 2018-02-15 05:15:52 Women are like the stock market! 

High volatility usually can come with great returns or huge losses. Usually these are inexpensive stocks. 

Low volatility, usually have less risk but it’s more of a long term hold with a good return in the long run. Less chance of losing 
4455 2018-02-15 05:15:45 I’m all for passing any and all common sense laws that can and will save lives.  No one should have acesss to these weapons, bump stocks, AR, etc.   I also believe it will not stop mass shooting. We need to go farther too. Find the root cause, address mental health care as well.
4456 2018-02-15 05:15:43 Right, but it essentially serves as a means to turn a semi-automatic weapon into a converted automatic weapon, which is heavily regulated. Bump stocks are a means to circumvent the laws in the books.
4457 2018-02-15 05:15:41 Just hold for ten years stocks are overpriced; silver and gold are cheap with the amount of Fake money in circulation; Eno drives prices. Lets make paper money  more powerful.
4458 2018-02-15 05:15:40 I know how fast they shoot lol do you think I dont know the difference? bump stocks are legal in some places. those are all specifics

4462 2018-02-15 05:14:43 Most people I know (and I know a lot of liberal people) wouldn't want to take away the ability for anyone to defend themselves or own guns. Just make stricter laws and ban certain things. Such as bump stocks. I would definitely want to ban bump stocks.
4463 2018-02-15 05:14:13 Bump stocks don’t make them automatic, there’s a switch you have to fiddle with. A bump stock helps mimic the firing speed the same as a pea trigger to where you don’t have to pull the trigger all the way back the slightest pull will fire the gun
4464 2018-02-15 05:14:08 Yup let's just ignore that and focus on the ar15  bump stocks and suppressors. Smh platforming off the innocent lives. Sick!
4465 2018-02-15 05:14:07 I've seen The Big Short (2015) so ummmm yeah I know about stocks and bonds thnx 
4466 2018-02-15 05:14:05 Background checks waiting periods a test equivalent to a road test 4 a driver's license and most of all keep functional weapons of war and upgrades like bump stocks out of Civilian hands. Collectors can have permanently disabled weapons. No more blood of children on your hands.
4467 2018-02-15 05:13:17 handguns and single shot hunting rifles yes ... automatics or bump stocks .. not at all

Maybe when we have a Dem Congress there’ll be gun control laws that limit number of guns, access to guns, make bump stocks illegal. Just a start.

4473 2018-02-15 05:12:20 Pode deixar. Tem umas Stocks por aí. Se eu precisar, te aviso!
4474 2018-02-15 05:11:26 Obviously, there are then bump stocks and such, but that’s for another day. This was a tense, but productive discussion.
4475 2018-02-15 05:11:09 Colorado outlawed bump stocks after Las Vegas, but we still can’t get our shit together to ban assault rifles. It boggles my mind.
4476 2018-02-15 05:11:08 We are all to blame for the #ParklandShooting Congress has failed the people by not taking action!  No one needs an assault rifle. No one needs access to bump stocks. Why should we be afraid to go to church, festivals, the movies or school? #GunControl
4477 2018-02-15 05:10:41 After LV, there was barely a whimper about the idea of banning bump stocks. It’s a clear effort to get around the decades old ban on new fully auto weapons.

4480 2018-02-15 05:10:26 No semi automatic rifles and bump stocks.  Period.
4481 2018-02-15 05:10:22 Common sense gun laws now...
1) No fly list = no buy list
2) 7 day wait on all purchases
3) Mental problems = no gun without physicians approval
4) Domestic abuse = no gun
5) Ban on assault/military style weapons and bump stocks.
4482 2018-02-15 05:09:21 S'il vous plaît ne pas perdre à la bande dessinée, @MyLoveOnTheRox. Mes stocks s'effondreraient.

4484 2018-02-15 05:09:04 And companies laying off people by the thousands. Half the country do not own stocks, the "recovery" doest touch the poor and working class. "LOL"
4485 2018-02-15 05:08:30 You’re bought by the NRA. You refused to sign legislation on banning bump stocks. You’re bought by the NRA. Return your blood money.
4486 2018-02-15 05:07:52 How about we start with the record sale of bump stocks that were used in the Vegas shooting.. Nobody stood a chance in that slaughter!! Trump said it was too soon to discuss it.. And it has never come up since. Sensible gun laws should be open for discussion..
4487 2018-02-15 05:07:22 You have stuff like these things called bump stocks that makes regular guns shoot 5000x faster. You honestly expect me to believe the NRA loving gun junkie can't figgure out how to turn this into an even deadlier weapon? Heck replace the pellets with glass or something.
4488 2018-02-15 05:06:51 I have got a superpower, a Midas Touch, that works in an opposite way!
Stocks I buy go down and the ones I sell go up
4489 2018-02-15 05:06:46 Part of sensible gun control is instituting harsh punishments for illegally selling weapons. They aren’t harsh now. It’s also going to be getting rid of AR-15s and bump stocks.
4490 2018-02-15 05:06:37 That is why Presidents DIVEST STOCKS and interest into trust.... UNLIKE the elitist #NoTermLimit #InsiderTrading little #Dictators known as #Congress.... None so blind as those busy being @AntiTrumpers #TermLimits4All and #RROOTS

4492 2018-02-15 05:06:08 You guys have these legal bump stocks that makes a regular gun shoot 5000x faster, you telling me you can't turn something like this into a killing machine? You that dense?
4493 2018-02-15 05:05:58 I've been following you ever since I started as a prop trader back in 2007 & I traded nothing like you at all back then. Scalped listed stocks back then. With my restart here, I've learned a ton from your old intraday chart markups that I found on Google. Thanks for your work.
4494 2018-02-15 05:05:49 Let's not forget bump stocks haven't been banned despite acknowledgement by the fucking NRA that they should be.
4495 2018-02-15 05:05:47 Maybe someday, but I have way too much fun researching stocks on my own..

4498 2018-02-15 05:05:18 Oh it’s not a conspiracy it’s a fact, gun stocks SKYROCKET when mass shootings happen. The people who cause the gun problems we have today benefit from it. Every shooting I hear the screams and it just makes me sick. I know but I don’t know why it’s taking so long to fix this.
4499 2018-02-15 05:05:15 We’ve waited months to talk about bump stocks after Vegas.  How long do we wait, @mschlapp?  A month for each soul lost?
4500 2018-02-15 05:04:54 BTW the Vegas shooter had bump stocks which allow the firearm to bounce back from the recoil allowing the shooter to fire again without lifting his finger from the trigger. Which for the record are now not sold for that reason
4501 2018-02-15 05:04:51 Disgraceful that we allow these senseless mass shootings to KEEP happening over & over & over again. Repubs won’t even vote to close loopholes in gun laws, ban bump stocks, stop those on terrorist watch lists from buying guns, or call for background checks on ALL gun purchases.
4502 2018-02-15 05:04:42 Mind boggling. 
Rising rates are bullish.
Corrections happen when stocks get overvalued for a few hours.
I don't even know what to say anymore.
4503 2018-02-15 05:03:48 If you believe in fishing the bottom stocks, watch PNB. In weeks they might come up with a crisis back up plan.
4504 2018-02-15 05:03:42 one can hold 20+ bullets and the other can hold way less. Bad comparison. Not to mention the AR platform can be modified to be fully automatic easily and can have bump stocks (Las Vegas shooter used one).
4505 2018-02-15 05:03:26 Yes, there are laws you can start with -bump stocks, next assault rifles, then licensing, also if you have a mental illness, finally how about if you are on the terrorist list you can’t own a gun
4506 2018-02-15 05:03:06 Right.  Remove assault rifles, bump stocks and put in tougher restrictions on those with violent histories and mental illness.  Problem with that?
4507 2018-02-15 05:01:29 End Republican Congressional Congressman terms. Bum Stocks are STILL legal. 17 more children are dead! #EndGunViolence

4509 2018-02-15 05:01:13 Emotions are the biggest driver in buys (TVs, cars, crypto, stocks..) The nail in the coffin for bad purchases is confiding in the "crowd". Innately we all look for verification by our peers, aka we just want 2 fit in.
4510 2018-02-15 05:00:49 Who the hell is packing heat to church ? This is so damn dumb!  Common sense gun laws are what we need!  Ban assault rifles and bump stocks! #startthere
4511 2018-02-15 05:00:44 Then he would have avoided the hotel and selected another target. Police said he scoped out other venues. 

Besides, when guns are outfitted with bump stocks, how many do you really need? He could easily bring guns up over a few days without alerting security.
4512 2018-02-15 05:00:41 AR-15's!!!

4513 2018-02-15 05:00:21 You are absolutely wrong.
Someone says this every single time and it all just goes away in a few days time.
We can't even get fricking "Bump Stocks" banned, and that's a no brainier.
Paddock had armour piercing bullets, not like Bambi wears armour and they want them legal.
FUCK!!
4514 2018-02-15 05:00:06 Doubtful, unless said bears are dumb enough to not also be long Gold/short bonds.. This market is going down in a very big way very soon.  Just a matter of time before CB's give up on stocks to save bonds. Bonds are a much bigger market than stocks...
4515 2018-02-15 04:59:33 “ can we let them grieve” today turns into “time to move on” tomorrow.  Remember bump stocks?  Go take your crocodile tears somewhere else, Tomi. And ask the families who have lost children whether they’d like us to wait to do something about it.
4516 2018-02-15 04:59:30 hey Dean - YOU represent Nevada - Las Vegas - what have YOU done to even legislate on a no brainer like bump stocks?????   ZIP   ZERO  NADA   

WE NEED LAWS!!!
4517 2018-02-15 04:59:29 The disturbing part for the average investor was the velocity of it.  10% in a few days can scare away investors who don’t have an IA to hold their hand. But a 10% correction from overbought levels is healthy-allowing  quality stocks to re-emerge.
4518 2018-02-15 04:58:59 But it is about politics. No other 1st world country has this problem. The republicans only offer prayers instead of passing simple things like background checks. And that talk of banning bump stocks was a ruse. And we treat this as normal!
4519 2018-02-15 04:58:52 If you’re stockpiling AR-15’s with bump stocks, yes.
4520 2018-02-15 04:58:16 We also need to completely ban bump stocks so people can stop finding loopholes.
4521 2018-02-15 04:58:11 Ngl but after learning about stocks and investments its actually kinda fun. If only i have more money to actually put in the market 
4522 2018-02-15 04:57:50 You missed the point. I was explaining why I prefer to invest in WEED stocks vs. Blockchain stocks
4523 2018-02-15 04:57:32 Was reading somewhere that gun stocks actually go up everytime there’s a shootout... since people anticipate that govt will crackdown & so stores pile up the stocks so that there are more sales... weird!
4524 2018-02-15 04:57:21 Largest mass killing in United States history happened with a guy who was a Law Abiding Citizen who purchased all of his guns and bump stocks legally. Quit letting Fox News form your opinion for you, do some research, and then form your own opinion.

4527 2018-02-15 04:55:28 Statewide testing (with retesting every 3 years) to own a license, registration and insurance, background/mental health checks, mandatory safety classes, make bump stocks illegal.
4528 2018-02-15 04:53:35 Today I walked into stocks and all she says is " Rebecka what happen, you didn't tell me any of this"
4529 2018-02-15 04:53:17 There are plenty on the right who believe that no one but the military and certain law enforcement should have AR-15s or bump stocks. But what am I wasting my energy on here?
4530 2018-02-15 04:53:12 Vote anyone who takes NRA or gun manufacturer money out of office. Replace them with promoters of common sense gun laws:
Background Checks
Take Abusers' Guns
Ban Under-21s
Safe Storage
End Straw Purchases
Ammunition Checks
End Immunity for Firearm Liability
Ban Bump Stocks
4531 2018-02-15 04:52:43 So background checks, closing loopholes, requiring education and training, banning bump stocks, banning military grade weapons, trying to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, violent felons and the mentally ill, no concealed carry reciprocity, etc; all that is idiotic?
4532 2018-02-15 04:52:34 Trying to ban your bump stocks

Bugo jud ning taga Pizzakaya. Kagabie mag dinner date unta mi ddto. I asked for reservation they agreed. Nkabantay ko dghan out of stocks sa menu. I told them dghanon stocks ugma kay valentines. MuKusog ilang business.
4534 2018-02-15 04:52:15 [Thread] If I were President, within my first 100 days, while most people still liked me, I would sign an executive order giving Congress 100 days to come up with a workable ban on automatic rifles and bump stocks along with further necessary gun regulation 1.
4535 2018-02-15 04:51:36 Semi- auto --- bump stocks --- no use in civilian hands -- they are only good for killing and killing multiple people-- 30 round magazines are not needed for hunting- if you need thirty shots to bring down a deer you better go to the grocery store.
4536 2018-02-15 04:51:21 Honestly it’s come to a point where a mass shooting occurs and I expect nothing. Los Vegas happened and gun stores completely started selling out of bump stocks. Like that’s a little.. concerning.. no? Just me? What do I know.

4539 2018-02-15 04:51:14 Not even a ban on bump stocks.

4551 2018-02-15 04:48:34 No. Columbine was almost 20 years ago. Those boys wanted to set a record and they did, using available technology and clever tactics. They didn’t know that Paddock would use bump stocks to beat their record.
4552 2018-02-15 04:48:31 And like clockwork, gun company stocks will rise...
4553 2018-02-15 04:46:53 You won't even ban bump stocks! Save your fake prayers. You don't pray.

4555 2018-02-15 04:46:17 If you mean ICE acting like gestapo.....?  There are limits to free speech and the NRA lobby ginning up a gun culture does not make it right or Constitutional. Having a gun does not mean we make assault rifle, AR15s and bump stocks legal. They NEVER SHOULD BE. PERIOD.
4556 2018-02-15 04:46:00 No exceptions.
 PERIOD! No fucking BUMP STOCKS. No 30 rounds magazines.

4561 2018-02-15 04:44:23 Small, incremental steps - eg universal background checks, mandatory basic training in responsible gun ownership, ban bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.

4566 2018-02-15 04:43:37 I know that there are varying opinions about whether bump stocks increase casualties but they certainly do not reduce them. After Vegas they were going to be outlawed. Nothing. The NRA strikes again. What could it have hurt to outlaw them
4567 2018-02-15 04:43:21 Changing the barrel increases the caliber to what? Bump stocks will be made for whichever rifle is most popular. Dirt cheap extended magazine? Enjoy your misfeed.
4568 2018-02-15 04:43:13 "Campaign contributions from the NRA and our stocks in kid-sized casket manufacturers."  ~ GOP #ThingsIdNeverGiveUpForLent
4569 2018-02-15 04:42:48 Yep if the ban was in place he would not have had the same AR15 with extending mags and bump stocks that basically makes them fully auto
4570 2018-02-15 04:41:59 @SenFeinstein @RepWilson @Lawrence @thehill @maddow how many Senators and house representatives own these automatic weapons? With bump stocks? Perhaps some of the senators who do NOTHING, should visit more schools? Or at least give their dirty money to help victims! ALL of it!
4571 2018-02-15 04:41:31 We start by renewing the assault rifle ban, banning large magazines, bumper stocks. These are weapons for murder, & they’re being purchased legally, & stockpiled. We stop gun show sales, person-to-person sales. 1/

4573 2018-02-15 04:40:47 Bump stocks don't change anything about the rifle. You can use a belt loop to mimic a bump stock. Swappable barrels to change caliber? So you really don't know what you're talking about.
4574 2018-02-15 04:39:55 Get off the couch, walk over to your boss and tell him to sign an executive order to BAN AR-15, bump stocks and all types of assault weapons.

4577 2018-02-15 04:39:40 I’m not anti-gun. We don’t need to change our schools, our security, our surveillance to accommodate people’s right to have semi-automatic weapons +/- bump stocks.  Maybe we need to take care of the mental illness that is so pervasive. Do you really just thinks guns win?
4578 2018-02-15 04:39:38 The same lawmakers who have made it easier than ever to obtain military style weapons? The same lawmakers who haven’t made bump-stocks illegal that turn semi-auto into full auto? The same lawmakers opposing states wanting to write laws to ban them? Those ‘lawmakers’?
4579 2018-02-15 04:39:07 Shopify Inc and Twitter stocks shooting to the moon the last few weeks too. TTD, OLED and Square Inc. to follow in the next few weeks.

4581 2018-02-15 04:38:55 I was an NRA member myself for many years - Today's NRA needs a Reality Check - NO to bump stocks - NO to assault rifles - NO to high volume clips - And that's just a start folks
4582 2018-02-15 04:38:38 Please tell this to my morally bankrupt PoS Congressman, @SpeakerRyan. He's been "thoughts and prayers" for nearly 20 years now, all while voting to make weaponry more available to anyone with US currency & a pulse. Hell, he won't even allow a vote to do away with bump stocks.
4583 2018-02-15 04:37:59 Never going to get handguns, rifles or shotguns. It is a dead argument. Have to focus on assault rifles, bump stocks, high capacity mags, etc. they need to go ASAP. There is no purpose for them.

4593 2018-02-15 04:35:22 They were but had bump stocks which simulate auto.. which I'm for banning. Every pull of the trigger is spring loaded on the shoulder which shoots next shot
4594 2018-02-15 04:35:21 It’s so frustrating. But we can’t make firearms illegal because it’s a “right”. And we can sell bump stocks still that turn regular guns into automatic weapons. WHY AMERICA. Haven’t we seen enough of the negative consequences of liberal gun laws?
4595 2018-02-15 04:33:39 Bryan, you should support a ban on assault rifles AR-15s doing the highest carnage (We had one from 1994-2004until GOP controlled Congress fought renewal) Also a ban on bump stocks, large mags, and silencers. And stricter background checks. Can you do that please?
4596 2018-02-15 04:33:26 Happy about this @Snapchat update...  Once their stocks n subscribers decrease...  #BragChamp can save the day...
4597 2018-02-15 04:33:05 Thanks to the Las Vegas shooting, we’re all familiar with bump stocks now.  Pretty cheap to convert any AR-15 into a semi- automatic, legally, in case you didn’t know that...
4598 2018-02-15 04:31:49 I am aware of what a bump stock is and how they work. You completely avoided my question though. How many lives would have been saved if bump stocks were illegal?
4599 2018-02-15 04:31:25 Got money invested in stocks .... last week I was down about a stack and it stayed that way for a good 2 months..... I’m just now seeing a come up
4600 2018-02-15 04:31:20 She isn't a "dude" your solution sounds familiar... You must be an NRA supporter... We don't need more guns, we need to ban assault rifles & bump stocks, AND force our representatives to keep mental health services for those in need available!
4601 2018-02-15 04:30:28 Not only will it not stop, you can bet stocks will rise for gun manufacturers. Fox and the right are masters at using mass shootings to stoke fears about gun bans, sending thousands to their local gun shops.  Happens every time.

4604 2018-02-15 04:30:08 Go dye your roots. We did that with Vegas. Today is the day it needs to be talked about, and tomorrow, and the next, then act! When is enough enough? WTF does anyone need assault rifles, ar15's bump stocks, semi auto weapons for in civilian circumstances? They don't!
4605 2018-02-15 04:28:27 Actually, they have done worse than nothing. They allowed the ban on assault weapons to expire, refused to ban bump stocks, all the while lining their pockets with contributions from the NRA. #GunControlNow #NRATerrorism
4606 2018-02-15 04:28:20 This congress won’t even act on bump stocks that only act to circumvent a ban on automatic weapons. Focus on local regulation and send these sell outs home.
4607 2018-02-15 04:28:18 Saw a few tweets by Nazi teacher saying why not kill immigrants instead of deporting them... Reply to Ann Coulter, so yeah, you try again! Racism runs deep in certain places, unfortunately! We need to stop AR's & bump stocks!
4608 2018-02-15 04:28:06 You can create rules for that though. Bad apples can ruin the bunch. Bump Stocks can make Vegas another possibility. The Texas church shooting was helped due to someone being allowed to have a gun due to a slip in the cracks. Making background checks more through should be good
4609 2018-02-15 04:28:02 watch, gunmaker stocks will rise tomorrow in anticipation of a spike in gun purchases.
This will be the only significant reaction.
This is a truly fucked up country.

4611 2018-02-15 04:27:51 Are the bump stocks are still available?
4612 2018-02-15 04:27:27 For those saying an AR15 isn't an automatic. The AR-15 is versatile, affordable and highly customizable. Almost every part is replaceable to make it Automatic. Bump Stocks, Trigger mods, Gat cranks, etc. Combine that with stick mags, drum mags, you can hold 30 to 100 rounds.
4613 2018-02-15 04:26:38 In 2013, #US 10 year @ 2.91%. #EM assets were under significant strain. 2018, US 10 year @2.91%, EM #assets are favourite go go assets. What changed... #Cycles and context.. during 2013, it was #deflation cycle, USD the only dog in town, US stocks, only game in town.
4614 2018-02-15 04:26:31 Banks might recover some loan from corporates by selling their assets but what about farmer loans which go to rich farmers not poor farmers and never come back....Is @PMOIndia working on action plan to screen profile of farmers??

4615 2018-02-15 04:26:29 How about ditching that stupid wall and putting money toward gun control? Does the NRA own you, too? Do people need AR-15's, AK-47's, bump stocks, etc.? Only if they are going to mass murder. DO SOMETHING
4616 2018-02-15 04:26:27 "Both sides??" @GOP is the tool of the NRA. Every Dem attempt to pass common sense laws, like better background checks, torpedoed by Republicans. Assault ban ended. Can't even get bump stocks outlawed! Trump just signed a bill to make it easier for mentally ill to buy weapons.
4617 2018-02-15 04:26:19 No. I am female and I own several guns.
Mine are for protection. I live in a very remote area, 45 mins from any responders.
BUT! I am well trained, have a license, keep them in safe locations.
Responsibility.
Caution.
Knowledge. 
We need strict laws, no AK’s or bump stocks.
4618 2018-02-15 04:26:10 and stocks reacting like there is no tmrw...
4619 2018-02-15 04:26:08 Then man up and Ban asdault rifles and bump stocks, or are you in the NRA’s back pocket as well?
4620 2018-02-15 04:26:00 Actually Bump stocks are still legal. The ATF ruled it as an unregistered firearm accesory making it legal
4621 2018-02-15 04:25:47 If I’m planning a funeral for my CHILD it’s time to talk about guns. Families can grieve but we are a nation of laws (remember?) #ProChoice is #ProLife. No more fucking guns with bump stocks or military grade capacity. Our kids are not the  sacrificial lambs of gun zealots.
4622 2018-02-15 04:25:45 Then sponsor a bill supporting #guncontrol and don’t be afraid to use these words. AR-15s, bump stocks shouldn’t be in hands of people. Background checks for all sales should be mandatory. Please be more impactful for the people of FL.
4623 2018-02-15 04:25:38 Its always happy to see the stocks going down after selling
&   painful to see  going up
4624 2018-02-15 04:25:21 And you are entitled to yours and have the right to express it, I have not argument with that. But the only use of assault still weapons is murder, they need to be strictly regulated and bump stocks need to be outlawed.
4625 2018-02-15 04:25:17 Okay, we want gun control. For example, outlaw bump stocks. Stricter background checks.
4626 2018-02-15 04:24:57 Technically, a machine gun is a full automatic, all but banned (bump stocks notwithstanding). An AR-15 is like a large Glock in that respect
4627 2018-02-15 04:24:36 I wonder if the religious folks know the amount of stocks in fire arm companies the Vatican holds......
4628 2018-02-15 04:24:12 Throw in a few bump stocks as a bonus!

4631 2018-02-15 04:23:47 It's not difficult Senator. Save your breath because prayers don't work. It's your job to keep Americans safe. So get to work. Pass sensible gun laws like banning assault rifles & bump stocks. Give residents better access to mental healthcare. #SensibleGunLaws #BanAssaultWeapons
4632 2018-02-15 04:23:03 do you consider Bump Stocks to be sensible?  They are still legal despite being opposed by almost everyone (including the NRA)
4633 2018-02-15 04:22:38 No solutions? Interesting...kid is capable of buying an AR-15 legally, extended magazines legally, bump stocks legally...you’re right though, no way this could have been prevented...
4634 2018-02-15 04:22:08 @contrarianEPS @BalakrishnanR  even after such fraud related to pnb/gitanjali,stocks not on down freeze ...finding value still in them or superbull market ?
Or may be 11300cr  not a big fraud in 2018,have seen bigger.
4635 2018-02-15 04:22:04 females come round when the stocks up
4636 2018-02-15 04:21:47 Investors bid up stocks Wednesday despite a new report that revealed a faster rise in inflation than expected.
4637 2018-02-15 04:21:16 But those that immediately attack a specific type of firearm or bump stocks or high capacity magazines... etc. Those people aren't considering the problem and logical ways to solve it. They are reacting emotionally and that's dangerous for everyone.
4638 2018-02-15 04:20:40 Cuomo better hold some congressmen to the fire on doing some policy changes over this. Ban Ar-15s or put people who buy Ar-15s on a list. Put gps chip/lte 3G cards in the Ar 15 so it doesn't go near school Or ban bump stocks. Something. Republicans need to pass something.
4639 2018-02-15 04:20:24 You can protect yourself with a shotgun or handgun with bullets. AR-15s with bump stocks/20+ bullet clips are over the sanity line. And you know that. I know in your heart you know that the right to own a gun is not the same as the “right” to own a military style assault weapon.
4640 2018-02-15 04:20:14 We can't eradicate situations like that, but we can remove military grade weapons and bump stocks as well as stricter vetting against people with a history of violence and or mental illness owning weapons.  It's a great start.

4646 2018-02-15 04:17:08 Notice, Rich, how the Dems shut the government down for illegal aliens, NOT to get bump stocks banned. Can you not get it through your meathead thick skull as to where their priorities lie?

4648 2018-02-15 04:16:26 What the hell does video games have to do with this?  Plain/simple the NRA pushes a narrative.  Assault weapons need to be banned as well as bump stocks and vetting for ownership stricter with violent crimes and mental illness issues reflected in the vetting process.
4649 2018-02-15 04:16:14 I'm also against guns that are so easy to modify like the one in Vegas. I hate that bump stocks are still legal.

4651 2018-02-15 04:16:06 Yes!  I thought the GOPigs
in congress were going to
pass a bill to eliminate
bump stocks after the 
Las Vegas shooting.
They wait for the dust to
settle and do absolutely
Nothing.
4652 2018-02-15 04:15:44 What do you care ... nothing to see here, Just another school shooting, How bout those gun stocks......eh?  Read the lyrics to money money money by the OJays (the theme song to the apprentice).  America is LIVID
4653 2018-02-15 04:15:34 Really @FoxNews ? Do you need a firearms expert on staff? I’ll do it on call for a very small fee so you stop making asses of yourselves!!!! Don’t show stock videos of bumpfire stocks when they were NOT used in the shooting!!! WTF!!! Please feel free to contact me!!!
4654 2018-02-15 04:15:18 The photo shown on the news of the AR-15 used in the shooting appeared to show it was equipped with a “bump stock”.  While I am an avid supporter of the Second Amendment, the “Bump Stocks” should be banned.  There is no good legal use for the device.
4655 2018-02-15 04:14:49 You can't stop bump stocks. They are easy to make.
Reducing magazine capacity doesn't do anything but make you feel better. Mentally unfit patients are already denied acres of their doctor Dems them a danger.
Stop with this red versus blue crap. Try being American for once
4656 2018-02-15 04:14:20 Who has inside info on stuff like this? Good thing this isn’t stocks or else the SEC would have a field day
4657 2018-02-15 04:14:17 What I know recently is banning bump stocks & mirroring the 90’s Assault Weapons Ban. 

On a bipartisan level I know that everyone wants to fix the incompetence with clerical errors which besides illegal possession has been a how the suspect has obtained a majority of weapons.
4658 2018-02-15 04:14:11 I do like that you are thinking about it sensibly though and thinking of ideas.  In IL after vegas a D proposed a bill that was very restrictive was a bad bill.  R rep proposed one just banning bump stocks and was supported by even gun owners, yet opposed by Ds.  Why!?!?!?
4659 2018-02-15 04:14:03 And how many of those deaths involved a bump stock? Better yet how many lives would banning bump stocks have saved? Do you believe that criminals or mentally unstable people would say "well since I can't use a bump stock I'll just not murder today."
4660 2018-02-15 04:14:00 Im of the same ideology, can we get Congress to start with bump stocks and universal background checks?
4661 2018-02-15 04:14:00 I am behind disgusted. I read there's been 18 school shootings in 2018 so far!! The youth of our country are being MURDERED and all the government cares about is stupid legislation and their ties into the NRA and gun company stocks.
4662 2018-02-15 04:13:35 As someone strongly pro-gun, Bump stocks should have been classified as Class-3 Firearms.
4663 2018-02-15 04:13:32 Why shouldn't people have "extended" mags, bump stocks, and "assault weapons"? Because it upsets you?
4664 2018-02-15 04:13:28 I like how he brings up bump stocks from Vegas, and how we have learned from that. Well, what has been done about bump stocks since the Vegas shooting? Are we even allowed to talk about the Vegas shooting yet?
4665 2018-02-15 04:13:11 NEOGEN PACT stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
4666 2018-02-15 04:13:04 An assault weapons ban including a ban on high capacity ammunition clips and bump stocks will help reduce the carnage.  Mandatory safety training for anyone that wants to purchase a firearm will help to to reduce the carnage
4667 2018-02-15 04:12:59 That graph you show of profits is that from a mix of options and stocks
4668 2018-02-15 04:12:31 Shouldnt it be the other way round? If Fed hikes, bond may not like it and stocks might like it and commodities outperform at the very late cycle
4669 2018-02-15 04:12:16 I am completely open to reasonable limitations.  Bump stocks: unneeded.  History of domestic/physical abuse: no weapons for you, etc.  but to say because I don’t want all weapons confiscated makes me a murderer does not make me part of the problem...
4670 2018-02-15 04:11:56 No one saying 30,000 people a year killed by guns is a good thing, but you liberals are so quick to pass laws to ban something. If it were up to you bump stocks would be banned by now, because of one person in 20 years used one to commit murder. How do we even have cars anymore?
4671 2018-02-15 04:11:48 Stocks amazing, economy amazing, employment amazing - but we will talk to mepurple:
4672 2018-02-15 04:11:15 Stand down buddy
We don't want fire arms 
We believe in the right to bear arms
We want any one to be able to purchase a firearm for personal & home protection
What the Blue Wave will do is legislate bump stocks,10 shot magazines, make sure mental patients denied access 
Ooh Rah
4673 2018-02-15 04:10:49 I support the second amendment. Period. I don't support a disgruntled student legally buying an assault rifle to which he could also have added bump stocks. It's out of control. It's crazy. Period.
4674 2018-02-15 04:10:39 Yes no bump stocks, background checks at gun shows, buying only from a dealer with paperwork and not allowing people to carry from state to state oh and limit to magazines maybe a start but they don't even want to have the discussion so sad

4676 2018-02-15 04:09:48 Totally agree. Those always seem to be the weapon used in mass shootings. Those belong only in war zones, not on the streets. Seems to me they could ban bump stocks and assault weapons & still not violate the 2nd amend.
4677 2018-02-15 04:09:46 Pelosi knew the Federal Reserve was going to use Quantitative easing to hold inflation and interest rates low. This flooded the market with cheap money. Driving stocks up. Pelosi knew and took advantage. Millions were made by Congress Obama administration.
4678 2018-02-15 04:09:32 Actually, @FLGovScott that time was 18 years ago. It’s way past time for conversations. It’s time for actions, for common sense gun laws, for banning assault weapons &  bump stocks. It’s time to stop hoping the killing will stop and protect our kids.
4679 2018-02-15 04:09:30 Statistically speaking, most break-ins happen when the house is empty. So I most likely won’t be home. But you’re also misunderstanding the argument. MR-15 assault rifles should be banned, as well as bump stocks. If protection is your argument - a handgun should work just fine
4680 2018-02-15 04:09:00 Thanks, but it's time for hubby's NRA to allow some sensible gun laws. . Like stopping the sale of bump stocks. The shooting in Vegas should have been a wake up call..But your hubby didn't want to address it then.. Or now..or anytime really.. The NRA and Russia are off limits..
4681 2018-02-15 04:08:58 No we don't have anything in control Some of those shootings were gun free zones BUT most guns were bought LEGALLY & EASILY too easily along with bump stocks & funny you didn't list any of the SCHOOL MASSACRES
4682 2018-02-15 04:08:37 never said he didn't have bump stocks. i said the gun can do 45 rounds a second. this is ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER.
4683 2018-02-15 04:07:05 Most people don’t want a full ban on fire arms. We want regulations, background checks, competency exams, etc. 

Why do people need bump stocks, extended mags, or assault weapons? 

Keep self defense weapons to handguns and allow competent, sane people to have concealed carries.
4684 2018-02-15 04:06:55 So what must you do to surf the secular inflation wave? Get into the Top 10%. Getting a foundation in stocks is a start. Do LT diversified low fee regular investments. Skip Stupid: trading, timing, big bets, hot tips, Option gyms..
4685 2018-02-15 04:06:35 Why do you think these families are grieving?  One parent has already attributed her child's death to the absolute failure of our elected officials to do ANYTHING about bump stocks, about mental health background checks, about ANYTHING!
4686 2018-02-15 04:06:34 Bump stocks? Yeah toss that one out. Back round checks at gun shows? I think that could be arranged. You got one you'd like to see?
4687 2018-02-15 04:04:48 Yes I have. I pulled the trigger and one bullet came out. As for bump stocks. I don’t know much about them. But if it makes a semi-automatic into an automatic..... then that gun should be considered automatic and illegal
4688 2018-02-15 04:03:24 And unfortunately the Republicans in Congress and Ehite House will do nothing at all to prevent further mass shootings. They will not ban AR 15s or bump stocks not will they fix background checks
4689 2018-02-15 04:03:15 Same network of followers that will be laying off people due to the fact those networks you watch will be laying off more people for fake news LOL!!!! CNN and MSNBC LOL! Gun sales exploded and gun makers stocks exploded with profits during Obama. It is called facts simple idiots

4692 2018-02-15 04:02:33 rings true to me? maybe more about defense stocks tan childrens lives
4693 2018-02-15 04:02:28 The AR-15, used today to kill 17 at a Parkland High School, can be outfitted with a "bump stock", which allowed a shooter to kill 58 and injure 422 in Las Vegas a little over four months ago.

Both AR-15s and "bump stocks" are legal to buy in most of the United States.
4694 2018-02-15 04:02:07 Those aren’t substantive solutions. Nobody is buying these guns at guns shows, bump stocks were used in 1 mass shooting and the effect is easily replicated w/o them (I don’t have a problem with banning them, btw) and the last assault weapons ban (gun bans generally) didn’t work.
4695 2018-02-15 04:01:44 ...yet every ammosexual is perpetually erect for fully automatic weapons, some willing to skirt the intent of the law as seen via bump stocks.
4696 2018-02-15 04:01:21 I will be on Statewide Drive radio @ABCNSW today at 4.45pm to discuss markets and stocks.
4697 2018-02-15 04:01:11 Nothing feels better than seeing ya stocks go up 
4698 2018-02-15 04:01:00 No one who isn't military or police should have access to an AR-15. PERIOD.  Let's do something meaningful and make them illegal along with the bump stocks (that we STILL haven't passed legislation to fix.).
4699 2018-02-15 04:00:50 Admiring stocks we don't own, missed or didn't study well enough  is a handy habit.Helps us prepare for the next  conviction building idea.
4700 2018-02-15 04:00:27 Ban bump stocks
Ban high capacity magazines
Universal background checks
Expand “watch lists”
Re-ban crazy folks from buying guns
Ban assault rifles
Fed trigger-locks

There’s no silver bullet. But there are MANY ways to keep bullets OUT OF CHILDREN.
4701 2018-02-15 04:00:17 @ETHERDELTAZACK Please add JapaneseAVCoin (JAV) to your exchange. Thanks. @Papa_Stocks @JapaneseAVCoin
4702 2018-02-15 03:59:30 Not cutting millions from the background check system like Trump is proposing. Banning bump stocks.
4703 2018-02-15 03:58:42 Ban assault weapons. Ban those bump stocks . And come up with some strict gun laws. This has to stop. Stop taking money from the NRA and do your job @GOP
4704 2018-02-15 03:58:19 I don't think we are fighting just this monstrous administration. Bump stocks are still being sold; Texas wants to allow open carry at colleges. How do we stop it? I don't know.

4708 2018-02-15 03:56:56 Well popular mechanics does at least or so it appears. Bump stocks do not modify the max firing rate. It’s that simple. 45 rounds per minute bump stock or not.
4709 2018-02-15 03:55:56 Unfortunately, we can’t even get these assholes to ban bump stocks

4712 2018-02-15 03:54:45 Load up on gun stocks??
4713 2018-02-15 03:54:34 I & other constituents met w/ your KC staff in Oct. to ask for your help to #stopCCR & van bump stocks. The answer was NO and nothing done since.
4714 2018-02-15 03:54:23 Going forward it is becoming like stocks.Only big guys can in eat and grow their assets and profits.
4715 2018-02-15 03:54:07 1. Stocks up, volatility down, things are great! 2. Bond yields rising, stocks down, volatility up, everyone sells everything, disaster! 3. Go back to 1
4716 2018-02-15 03:53:53 Amen fellas!  I don’t understand how people still think they need assault rifles, bump stocks and magazines that hold so many bullets.  It’s idiotic.
4717 2018-02-15 03:53:38 We aren’t getting saner about gun violence. We’re getting crazier. When Congress specifically allows people deemed incapable of cashing their checks to own guns, that’s nuts. Not banning bump stocks? Why not? Background checks? No fly, no buy? Is none of that within reason?
4718 2018-02-15 03:53:14 YOU SHOULD BE TALKING TO CONGRESS TO PASS LEGISLATION TO BAN ASSAULT/ military type weapons FOR THE PUBLIC   Bump stocks should be illegal. Could be a start. And for gods sake  DO NOT ALLOW THE MENTALITY CHALLENGED TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE ANY FIREARMS!!
4719 2018-02-15 03:52:25 Did you ban bump stocks yet @HouseGOP @SenateGOP ? No? Oh is the $ from the @NRA more valuable than lives of children? You disgust me.
4720 2018-02-15 03:52:16 Maybe instead of lobbying to keep bump stocks legal, campus carry, and Remington out of bankruptcy, the NRA could use member funds to pay for funerals of victims of gun violence? I'd respect that.
4721 2018-02-15 03:52:15 Also bam bump stocks, insist upon common sense gun laws, and shut down the Nfucki gRA.
4722 2018-02-15 03:52:01 @Marketsmojo some mojo stocks have volume less than 1k.. Shouldn't liquidity be one filter while pickin mojo stocks, lest investors find themselves trapped..
4723 2018-02-15 03:51:52 Because bump stocks!
4724 2018-02-15 03:51:28 wala akong right di nga kumi kita stocks ko eh
4725 2018-02-15 03:51:14 I, too, agree about the bump stocks, but there must be restrictions on the types of weapons, ammo, and accessories available - nothing convertible to automatic firing, no armor piercing rounds, or similar, no magazines greater than 10 rounds or so.  I know guns - not a fan.
4726 2018-02-15 03:51:12 @SenShelby @USRepGaryPalmer @DougJones BAN bump stocks and AR-15 NOW. No one needs them. Exert your authority and strength. Does not infringe 2A. Come on, do it! Thank you!
4727 2018-02-15 03:51:04 Why does anyone need an AR-15? Or bump stocks? Why are 18 year olds, who are not allowed to drink, allowed to buy them? @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @dougducey How many more shootings before you do something? Twenty? Fifty? Hundred?
4728 2018-02-15 03:50:53 Heidi, my take is that we fail to address gun control in a reasonable way.  All the statistics show we just have way more guns out there and way more mass shootings.  Until we care for our children more than we care about having to have Ak 47’s with bump stocks, then it goes on.
4729 2018-02-15 03:50:36 Sensex rises over 150 points, Nifty near 10,550; metal stocks lead gains
4730 2018-02-15 03:50:35 No one needs an assault rifle. Anyone convicted of violent crime, including domestic abuse/child abuse - no gun. People w/ severe mental illness - no gun. (We had this one, but Trump rescinded it). No bump stocks. No silencers. No exemptions from background checks at gun shows.
4731 2018-02-15 03:50:26 Since we can’t outlaw bump stocks or enact any sensible gun control law whatsoever, can we pass a law where we get to slap anyone who utters the words “thoughts & prayers?”

4733 2018-02-15 03:50:18 the gun stocks will probably rise tomorrow  @ReformedBroker pointed out how this always happens a while back
4734 2018-02-15 03:50:15 Anything on gun control? Bump stocks? Background checks? I didn’t think so.
4735 2018-02-15 03:50:15 Time to reinstate #AssaultWeaponsBan and include bump stocks, magazines and other “accessories” of mass destruction!
4736 2018-02-15 03:50:05 RT if prayers aren’t enough! Shameful! This carnage of our children must STOP! Give back your NRA money! Re-authorize the ban on automatic assault weapons! Universal background checks! Ban bump stocks! Close gun show loopholes! Do something!
4737 2018-02-15 03:50:01 This is currency not stocks .
4738 2018-02-15 03:49:53 And has become increasingly clear that we need strong background checks, ban on assault/militarystyle weaponry, ban on bump stocks, no open carry laws, more mental health resources. This does not deter from our 2nd amendment; that argument is bullshit.
4739 2018-02-15 03:49:32 I'm baffled that bump stocks weren't outlawed after Las Vegas. They're a grey area anyway and there is no reason they're even that.
4740 2018-02-15 03:49:31 *Especially* when you pair the AR-15 with high-capacity magazines and other accoutrements like bump stocks and suppressors that liberty also apparently dictates that we can’t outlaw.

4742 2018-02-15 03:49:13 And, despite the fantasies woven by NRA propaganda, a group of hillbillies with assault rifles and bump stocks won't last fifteen minutes vs. a tyrannical gov't.
4743 2018-02-15 03:49:08 Fund managers get the investors they deserve. 

If you keep hoping in and out of stocks, expect investors to do the same with your fund.
4744 2018-02-15 03:49:06 Nothing be suggested?  Like close the gun show loophole, universal background checks, bans on bump stocks, assault rifle bans?  Yeah nothing being suggested or done at all - from the NRA-bought GOP that is.
4745 2018-02-15 03:48:32 Hey @KG_Smith how many kids blood are on your boy @senrobportman's hands?

Where are the tweets against Ar-15s, & bump stocks & for universal background checks & closing the gunshow loophole & banning no-fly list from buying guns?

This is a #GOPMassacre we need #GunControlNow
4746 2018-02-15 03:47:59 And Congress willingness to even consider reciprocity, silencers and bump stocks.  It boggles the mind.
4747 2018-02-15 03:47:42 Twitter for stocks
4748 2018-02-15 03:47:16 I will examine the voting record of each candidate in 2018. If I find a single vote that supports bump stocks, rejects diligent backround checks for gun ownership, or makes gun licenses work like drivers licenses, that candidate will not get my vote. Tears for Parkland tonight.
4749 2018-02-15 03:47:13 I know many responsible gun owners who WANT sensible gun laws. And why the hell is an AK47, AR15 or bump stocks accessible to average citizens?its not for hunting...it's designed to kill high volumes of humans, quickly.
@NRA work for gun manaufacturers, f*ck them.
4750 2018-02-15 03:46:47 You’re right,  I don’t get why anyone in this country needs an AR-15 or bump stocks . Surely these guns aren’t used for hunting and aren’t needed for self defense. Their only use is to kill mass amounts of people quickly. Not what our forefathers had in mind.
4751 2018-02-15 03:46:45 Bump stocks were never banned after the Vegas shootings, fyi. Congress is in the NRA’s pocket. Until we vote those people out, nothing will ever change. #Parkland
4752 2018-02-15 03:46:29 I disagree. 
  Bump stocks could have been banned after Vegas but greedy gop/ NRA profiteers refused. 
 Florida gun laws are so lax anyone can buy a gun.
#GunControlNow
4753 2018-02-15 03:45:50 And Florida has bump stocks
4754 2018-02-15 03:45:30 Reinstate #AssaultWeaponsBan and include bump stocks, magazines & all other “accessories” of mass destruction!
4755 2018-02-15 03:45:16 And just because bump stocks weren't used this year, that's a reason to not ban them? They greatly increased the mortality and injury in Las Vegas. Is that not worth preventing even if it wasn't in the last 10? Is there no learning from past tragedies?
4756 2018-02-15 03:44:46 We have done this to DEATH - hundreds and thousands of deaths - the GOP way, the Conservative way, the NRA way. It is time for us to take a stand. No more. If you think your own access to firearms, to AR-15's & bump stocks, as more important than our kids, you are no patriot.
4757 2018-02-15 03:44:02 Oh penny stocks makes sense. Im interested in day trading penny stocjs but i dont have the time during the trading day.
4758 2018-02-15 03:43:30 And Congress voted for legislation permitting the sale of bump stocks
4759 2018-02-15 03:43:25 A day after last Fall's Las Vegas massacre, my British, pro #guncontrol, hunting stepfather went into a sporting shop and everyone was clearing out the bump stocks, afraid they would be outlawed. Of course, nothing happened, as per usual.
4760 2018-02-15 03:42:58 How’s the $3 MILLION dollars you took from the NRA? Congress has allowed this to happen. You couldn’t even ban bump stocks after Las Vegas but you will stay up all night long to pass the TaxScam bill. You GOP are the scum of the earth. Can’t wait to vote you all out. 
4761 2018-02-15 03:42:46 Yeah yeah yeah, no bump stocks to blame this time bitch. Let’s hire some former military or highly trained armed guards to protect our kids stop blaming the NRA.
4762 2018-02-15 03:42:34 I am sure that President Obama signed the Bill passing Bump Stocks to turn guns into machine guns.
4763 2018-02-15 03:42:28 There are many bills that have been suggested that congress won’t pass. Ban bump stocks. Ban AR15s. Mandatory background checks (also closing the gun show loophole). Ban people with domestic violence arrests from getting guns. Lift the ban on gun research, so many others...
4764 2018-02-15 03:42:23 True but at least it's going up.
4765 2018-02-15 03:42:06 If you care, actually do something . Ban AR-15s and bump stocks and assault rifles.  Require universal background checks.
4766 2018-02-15 03:41:54 Legislation banning bump stocks has stalled in Congress. This is unacceptable. People are dying. 

Another heart-breaking day for our Country, and no Congressional action since the last. 

#midterms are coming.
4767 2018-02-15 03:41:44 Another day, another mass shooting in America. Looks like all those thoughts and prayers that something like this never happens again are about as useless as Green Bay Packers “ownership” stocks.
4768 2018-02-15 03:41:40 Really? That’s your comment? You accepted over 31 million dollars from NRA in 2016 to get elected so you have the blood of these children on your hands! Get AR-15s OFF the streets, along with bump stocks!
4769 2018-02-15 03:41:27 A start is to ban AR-15 rifles. They're at the center of nearly every mass shooting, right? Remember the 15-second conversation about bump stocks after Las Vegas? But I have no interest in banning hunting rifles or personal handguns. None whatsoever.
4770 2018-02-15 03:41:26 "QE is like watching a good movie, because I don't know how it will end. Anyone who owns stocks will reevaluate his hand when it happens, and that will happen very quickly." - @WarrenBuffett, Annual Shareholder Meeting 2013
4771 2018-02-15 03:41:21 Vote Out ANY Elected Officials that take money from Gun/Ammo Lobbyists! BOTH @GOP &  @TheDemocrats !!!  Address Automatic Weapons, Extended Mags, Bump Stocks etc ASAP! #GunControlNow 
4772 2018-02-15 03:41:00 If you care, actually do something @SenatorTimScott  . Ban AR-15s and bump stocks and assault rifles.  Require universal background checks.
4773 2018-02-15 03:40:40 Can’t wait to trade stocks and be fuckin lit off a 5% gain. $wtc $neo $xmr $icx
4774 2018-02-15 03:40:36 TRAGEDIES the @GOP isn't even willing 2 discuss w/o @NRA ok. #GOP couldn't even make bump stocks illegal because of @NRA (donations). Everyone says 'Mental Illness' is the problem, last yr. trump signed an EO giving them right to buy  a gun. @Gop how much is a child's life worth?
4775 2018-02-15 03:40:27 $OMER one of the nastiest stocks I’ve ever encountered Totally manipulated no position and on my permanent restricted lis!!!
4776 2018-02-15 03:40:18 How about no unnecessary accessories like bump stocks?
4777 2018-02-15 03:40:03 Look you have the right to own as many guns as you want but I should have the right to know what type and how many guns you own. I should have right to know when I need to avoid the person that has ten AR-15s  with bump stocks and a hundred forty round magazines.
4778 2018-02-15 03:39:54 I think we need to round up all of the NRA members and line them up to hear their reasoning on citizens allowed to have assault weapons with bump stocks.  And then shoot them!
4779 2018-02-15 03:39:51 Reinstate the #AssaultWeaponsBan include bump stocks, magazines & all other “accessories” of mass destruction!
4780 2018-02-15 03:39:31 @donlemon  Come on Don!! Your guest blaming others for not picking up the phone after these social media posts and NOT ONE WORD ABOUT GUN CONTROL?? They couldn't even ban bump stocks and the MURDERS in Vegas!!! Tell that guy to Fok off!
4781 2018-02-15 03:39:18 @singularity_net what's the best Internet Of Things companies, cryptocurrencies, & stocks to invest in, for highest gains short term & long term???
Thank You!
4782 2018-02-15 03:38:57 Ban these assault/military weaponry, have strong background checks in a federal data base, no bump stocks, no open carry laws, resources for those with mental disorders.  Education to recognize those who might be in need of help and to know when to speak up about concerns.
4783 2018-02-15 03:38:53 If you care, actually do something @sendavidperdue . Ban AR-15s and bump stocks and assault rifles.  Require universal background checks.
4784 2018-02-15 03:37:00 Time to reinstate #AssaultWeaponsBan along with banning bump stocks, magazines & any other “accessories” to mass killing machines.
4785 2018-02-15 03:36:50 I get that.  So increasing Gun laws seems to be the way to go, AND then following the ones that exist.  But no one seems to do it.  Bump stocks should have immediately been outlawed after Vegas, but they weren't.  How fucking hard is that?
4786 2018-02-15 03:36:28 What about bump stocks moron
4787 2018-02-15 03:36:27 There has been more f***ing action to make Tide pods less of a hazard than there has to keep bump stocks and AR-15s out of civilian hands.
This is America.
When will it end?
#gunsense
4788 2018-02-15 03:36:08 Congress needs to be reminded every day. Remember how they were going to get rid of bump stocks after Vegas? Maybe it's still too soon.

4796 2018-02-15 03:34:19 I love shooting. I believe you have a right to defend your home. I believe you should be able to shoot the bear or cougar attacking you. I don’t believe you need an AR 15, large capacity magazines, and bump stocks to do it. #SensibleGunLaws #returnsanitytomycountry
4797 2018-02-15 03:33:50 Ban AR-15s and bump stocks and assault rifles.  Require universal background checks @realDonaldTrump
4798 2018-02-15 03:33:46 Why dont you sack up and do somerging about it POTUS. If you imposed gun controls and full registration and banned assault rifles, lg mags, bump stocks etc you might even have a shot at re-election...hahaha
4799 2018-02-15 03:33:37 Bump stocks illegal, no high capacity magazines, ammunition quantities limited and tracked like Sudafed, annual license renewal with proof of skill in order to purchase ammunition, stop NRA propaganda.
4800 2018-02-15 03:33:31 This country needs to stop choosing GUNS over the lives of its KIDS. ESPECIALLY AR15s, bump stocks and any other automatic assault weapons.
4801 2018-02-15 03:33:03 Ban AR-15s and bump stocks and assault rifles.  Require universal background checks.
4802 2018-02-15 03:32:58 im not anti-gun. im anti semi-auto/automatic weapons & bump stocks. this isn't Iraq.
4803 2018-02-15 03:32:49 Bump stocks do not convert a gun to full auto, they still depress the trigger for each shot, but I agree they should not be legal
4804 2018-02-15 03:32:31 Ban bump stocks or regulate like fully automatic guns, YES, of course. Magazine capacity NO - too arbitrary, impossible to prove when/where magazine obtained, and confusing mish-mash of laws. It's the gun, not the magazine or other attachments or visual design that matters.
4805 2018-02-15 03:32:31 I’m all for background checks for every gun transaction, there are waiting periods depending on flags in your history, and bump firing is a technique, but the stocks do make it easier. Firing at a higher rate makes you less accurate, but again, that wasn’t used today.
4806 2018-02-15 03:32:16 I agree that something needs done, but it is not as simple as saying ban AR-15s. A cultural change needs to occur.  Sure we can start with bump stocks, mags that hold over 30rds, better background checks, and I would say a gun safety course should be required to purchase.
4807 2018-02-15 03:32:12 Nice try. The points I listed are NOT implemented. Trump said last fall he wouldn't oppose no. 1, would eventually ban bumper stocks and assault rifles - but congress didn't act.
Since February 2017, it's actually easier for mentally ill people to buy guns.
4808 2018-02-15 03:31:50 Wow. What a false statement. I own a hunting rifle. Magazine size and bump stocks basically allow tons of bullets to fly within seconds.
4809 2018-02-15 03:31:43 @FLGovScott FUCK YOU WITH YOUR CONCERN.  GET RID OF AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND BUMP STOCKS. NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW
NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NO MORE AR15s NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW      DONT YOU CARE ABOUT CHILDREN YOU ASSHOLE?? ENOUGH
IS FUCKING ENOUGH
4810 2018-02-15 03:31:36 You tweet your prayers but don’t read the responses. All of you complicit MFs have blood on your hands. This election year and thereafter, we must remove every member who refuses to pass common sense gun legislation. Get rid of assault rifles & bump stocks, restrict handguns.
4811 2018-02-15 03:31:28 And even if he did it WHILE he was president I’m sure you still wouldn’t care, as long as your stocks are making you money! That’s the thing about Trump’s America, you don’t care about his tyranny if you have your panem et circenses
4812 2018-02-15 03:30:45 I have never mentioned getting rid of the 2nd amendment. Getting rid of bump stocks, large magazines and semi-automatics in the hands of plain old citizens is a start on our way back to sanity.
4813 2018-02-15 03:30:30 Begin with starting a wave of Senators who will no longer accept NRA contributions until they agree to strong background checks, ban on auto-assault, no bump stocks, mental health $$
4814 2018-02-15 03:30:30 There is plenty of room to act.  The Heller decision only determined there is an individual right to have a gun in the home.  It said nothing about banning semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks etc.  In fact, the court encouraged some bans, such as machine guns.
4815 2018-02-15 03:30:27 AMD- advanced micro devices,Inc seems to be the best option IMO with the release of the new ryzen chip and strong earnings it's currently trading around 12$ with pleanty of room for growth in it's sector, again IMO -chef #investing #Stocks #business #semiconductor

4819 2018-02-15 03:30:03 Be brave. Call your representatives to ask for an assault rifle ban. (202) 224-3121 #guncontrol Then call again and ask for a ban on bump stocks.  Then Call again and ask them to close the gun show loophole. Be brave.
4820 2018-02-15 03:29:02 If I invested Php50k in "NOW" stocks last Jan. 5, it would've been right about ~Php335k at this time. The power of social media in speculation today is scary.
4821 2018-02-15 03:28:59 Soooo the @NRA goes to the table with #guncontrol enthusiasts over bump stocks, the GC enthusiasts start shoving more hasty legislation at them and they wonder why we don't trust them. If the headlines are any indication, it's because you haven't listened. #ComeGetEm

4824 2018-02-15 03:28:22 Remember those 8 hours or so where we were gonna ban bump stocks?
4825 2018-02-15 03:28:15 Aren't you supposed to say "thoughts and prayers?"  Lucky for the students, Congress made bump stocks illegal.   Oh wait, you mean that hasn't happened?  My bad.
4826 2018-02-15 03:27:50 List of things YOU can do As a Senator:
1. Make it illegal for people convicted of violent hate crimes to buy or possess guns.
2. Require background check for every gun sale no matter where u buy a gun or who u buy it from. 
3. Ban manufacturing & sale of bump stocks #GunViolence
4827 2018-02-15 03:26:56 Isn’t that nuts that we have to have armed guards in schools? No where in the world is that necessary. Canada, UK, Germany, Switzerland etc. Not trying to ban guns just trying for some reasonable laws. ie background checks, waiting period, no bump stocks
4828 2018-02-15 03:26:49 Put the mental health amendment back on the books. Bump stocks gone. Will It stop it no but doing nothing is not working
4829 2018-02-15 03:26:41 Yeah he was really happy that your side went to the NRA renegging on your promise that you just wanted to talk about bump stocks.
4830 2018-02-15 03:26:07 No shit Marco, and thanks to Republicans crazy assholes have no problems getting guns, and bump stocks. Hell you can even be on the terror watch list and stock up on firearms.,,,ain’t that so Marco
4831 2018-02-15 03:25:48 No. I thought for sure the NRA would allow stopping Bump Stocks. Wrong.
4832 2018-02-15 03:25:43 Leader?? What a joke. NRA $$ speak louder than this teagic loss of life. This comment of yours is meaningless. Be a man and do right by the American people you claim to represent. No automatic rifles. No bump stocks. WHY is that so difficult?  Your greed is showing.
4833 2018-02-15 03:25:29 when I was little in the 70's my older brothers would take their guns to school on the bus b/c you could refinish the stocks as a shop project. Guns have always been around. What's different? Society & culture. Mainly culture
4834 2018-02-15 03:25:06 Even if legislation passes to ban semi autos, high cap mags, bump stocks etc., what happens to the shit that's already out here? #Parkland
4835 2018-02-15 03:24:48 Isn’t it about time people get smart about guns.  Me personally don’t believe in them.  But since so fucking retards believe in them at least ban these bump stocks and weapons that can unload like an automatic weapon @realDonaldTrump
4836 2018-02-15 03:24:42 Approx how much time needs to pass when we can “talk about it?”  Vegas massacre was in Oct.  Enough time to talk about bump stocks yet?  After 9/11 we were mobilizing the next day.  Respect the victims but doing something to fix the problem - today.
4837 2018-02-15 03:24:02 Banning bump stocks, improving background checks, etc., aren’t stopping the next mass shooting if the past 10 mass shootings are any guide.
4838 2018-02-15 03:23:50 peek into my mentality: I don't do homie stocks nor take offers to have a homie stocks. Fuels me to download the opponent to comeback.
4839 2018-02-15 03:23:21 @woodbridgeclb close over $240 today looking better.
4840 2018-02-15 03:22:55 The unfortunate truth is AR15 sales will go through the roof tomorrow and weapons manufactures stocks will soar.  Our culture is sick and getting sicker. This is only going to get worse until we ACT and do more.
4841 2018-02-15 03:22:48 Thoughts on bump stocks?
4842 2018-02-15 03:22:38 Parents aren't required by law to keep guns locked up
Gun lobbyists like NRA fund GOP for lax gun laws
GOP no ban on bump stocks
GOP won't even keep people on terrorist watch list from buying guns
GOP won't close loopholes
trump rolled back ban against mentally ill buying guns
4843 2018-02-15 03:22:05 And it will keep happening again until Congress takes ACTION. Start with a bill that bans assault weapons, magazines, and bump stocks. 18 school shootings this year AND ITS ONLY FEBRUARY!! We need #gunsensenow

4846 2018-02-15 03:21:47 also Ban Bump Stocks, Silencers, Close the Private Sale  Loophole, Require all sales to go through an FFL, include mental health  records and military records in the background checks. place limits on how many firearms can be bought in a single sale.
4847 2018-02-15 03:21:40 because the gun policy we have is working so well for us now.  Politicians are bought by the NRA.  There is plenty of room for the Second Amendment even while keeping semi-automatics and bump stocks out of schools.
4848 2018-02-15 03:21:40 There were no bump stocks used in Las Vegas all the guns were on tripods how many guns does one person need witnesses in Las Vegas said there was more than one shooter what little evidence has leaked out suggest there was more than one shooter the investigation was not normal
4849 2018-02-15 03:21:28 two days ago I debated for gun control. To ban assault rifles, ban bump stocks, enforce background checks, close loopholes & demand mental health checks...I lost
4850 2018-02-15 03:21:18 And my 7mm is more powerful, though not as many rounds in the magazine, more accurate, and a longer range than my AR. Perhaps if they’d make them with wood stocks and no ribbed hand guards they’d be more accepted.
4851 2018-02-15 03:21:17 Show your condolences by enacting real gun sense laws. No assault weapons, magazines, bump stocks. Strong bkgrnd cks, reporting methods when there are concerns. Enough is enough. The deaths of all gun violence victims is on you for not taking leadership on this epidemic.
4852 2018-02-15 03:21:16 Not about taking guns away...sensible gun laws...address mental illness, close gun show loop holes...accountability in ownership, storage, safety locks...reporting...types of ammunition...bump stocks...tougher full auto qualifying...certifications...
4853 2018-02-15 03:20:59 Great thread. I’m a Bernite and Iowan who’s not for collecting all guns. Im not exactly sure on my belief structure of guns in America but I’m definitely leftish on it. I don’t think any member of the public needs bump stocks or large capacity mags/drums. I’ll enjoy this thread
4854 2018-02-15 03:20:56 It's very simple:

1) No asult weapons 
2) No bump stocks
3) Mandatory background checks

Let's start with this.

4855 2018-02-15 03:20:35 I feel this recent volatility in stocks is like a wobbling spinning top before it falls...
4856 2018-02-15 03:20:33 Hey @realDonaldTrump if you’re so concerned, why don’t you work with Congress to, idk, maybe ban bump stocks? Or pass gun reform? Oh wait, I forgot, you don’t actually care. You’re bought by the NRA, like every other politician in Washington. THEY. DONT. GIVE. A. F*CK. ABOUT. U.
4857 2018-02-15 03:20:12 How many more school shooting do we have to have, how many more innocent lives have to be taken, how many families have to be broken until you understand civilians do not need a fully equipped Assult Rifle with Bump Stocks.
Pray For #Parkland
4858 2018-02-15 03:20:07 Indeed, let's focus on that.  How about stopping those on the terrorist watch list from buying guns?  How about introducing legislation to ban 'bump stocks'?  You are a Congressman - I'm not sure if you know this, but you can introduce legislation.
4859 2018-02-15 03:20:07 Then your only talking about bump stocks, which should be illegal except for those who legit need them for disability. (It's why PBO allowed them)
4860 2018-02-15 03:18:40 RT @jonathanweisman: Remember when a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers said they would ban bump stocks after Las Vegas and fix the instant background check system after Texas? Neither happened.
4861 2018-02-15 03:18:36 I don’t understand why it has to be one way or the other. Why not background checks for private sales AND arming/training law abiding citizens. Getting rid of bump stocks AND allowing for permitted carry. But all of them, red AND blue are bought and paid for to go extreme one way
4862 2018-02-15 03:18:03 Of the tens of thousands of bump stocks in circulation, there's only been one known use in a crime - Vegas.  A ban would not have stopped this, but it would prohibit law abiding users.   And, BTW, you don't need a bump stock to rapid fire that way.
4863 2018-02-15 03:17:50 You guys ever tell people the stock market is risky and way overbought?  Ever tell anyone to sell any stocks at all?

4865 2018-02-15 03:17:23 We already have background checks, all 50 states. Offenders already banned from getting guns. Feds not allowed under the constitution to ban MAGAZINE sizes. Oh, and they're call "bump stocks", anyone with a 3D printer can make one. Want to ban printers?
4866 2018-02-15 03:17:04 Sane people who own weapons are responsible.  No need to get snide.  Automatic weapons, bump stocks, are made for killing in irresponsible hands.  People with "issues" who amass weapons is not a collector, he is one episode from a serial killer. Wake up! Your fun, not worth kids
4867 2018-02-15 03:16:58 did gun stocks go up again this afternoon?
4868 2018-02-15 03:16:51 Cops at the school, shooter identified as a problem and gun pictures on social media, AR15...  you all won’t even outlaw assault weapons or bump stocks.  I guess money from the NRA is more important to you than children’s lives.  #onetermtodd
4869 2018-02-15 03:16:04 That's such a red herring. It's the question the NRA asks to shutdown debate. We still haven't banned bump stocks. Were they used in this shooting? No. But after Las Vegas, pretty much everyone agreed they shouldn't be legal ... yet Republicans did nothing.
4870 2018-02-15 03:15:54 Since he’s been elected, stocks have been extremely high.  He has, and currently is, bringing back companies to America which opens up good job/career opportunities for a ton of Americans.  There’s 2.  :)

4880 2018-02-15 03:12:58 There’s no reason for any private citizen to own a semi-automatic assault-style weapon or magazines that hold large numbers of rounds.., or bump stocks. Or to amass personal arearnals of weapons.
4881 2018-02-15 03:11:49 He modified the guns. With legal bump-stocks. So still legal.
4882 2018-02-15 03:10:36 Can we revisit bump stocks? Post Vegas, even Ryan said that ban was conceivable. What happened? The moment passed, the NRA got to work & now everyone is saying, "oh, but *today* had nothing to do with bump stocks"

Well, my friend still has bullet fragments thanks to a bump stock
4883 2018-02-15 03:10:28 Alex Jones is writing his sermon
Idiots about to buy more guns just in case
Gun stocks go up
4884 2018-02-15 03:10:23 The obvious trade has always been to buy gun stocks when Democrats are elected President and short them when Republicans are, since gun purchases are driven by a fear factor of no longer being able to purchase them. It is why gun sales were way up under Obama and down now.
4885 2018-02-15 03:10:09 Your party is in power. You could actually do something about this. It's been months and you haven't banned bump stocks yet after the Vegas shooting. The GOP is unable to govern & clearly values campaign dollars from the NRA over the lives of Americans.
4886 2018-02-15 03:09:36 *Port stocks-Gujrat Pipavav, Coaching Shipyard & Adani Port to be in focus today as Govt is considering to allow foreign vessels to operate in India coastal waters to boost domestic shipping industry.*
4887 2018-02-15 03:09:23 So many thoughts after today’s tragedy ... one of which: did Congress do anything to address bump stocks after the Vegas shooting? Google isn’t providing clear answers.
4888 2018-02-15 03:09:17 Gun safety courses are great. What I'm talking about is the NRA's pressure to stop sensible seeming measures like making bump stocks illegal after Las Vegas, or advocating for gun buyers to be able to load 'countless' magazines.
4889 2018-02-15 03:08:58 Then get your party in line with the majority of people and ban AR-15s, bump stocks and all weapons of war from private ownership. This has to start sometime.
4890 2018-02-15 03:08:31 They certainly do with their motto "any gun control starts the slippery slide down the slope to gun bans". Nope . It doesn't.  I would really like to hear *how promoting trigger locks and banning bump stocks is harmful.
4891 2018-02-15 03:08:14 1. Reinstate the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 that was allowed to expire in 2004, what were the negative effects?
2. Ban the sale of bump stocks, they are the stupidest most reckless inventions ever created.
3. Create gun watchdog org similar to what was done against big tobacco.
4892 2018-02-15 03:08:06 And lets not forget those neat bump stocks! Much better to hunt and kill
4893 2018-02-15 03:07:39 @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP @SenateGOP PURE EVIL are lawmakers held hostage by the NRA, worried about re-election money & not protecting schoolchildren from unspeakable horrors. Weapons of WAR (Assualt Rifles) are on our streets. U did nothing about bump stocks either.

4895 2018-02-15 03:07:17 On October 1, 2017, a gunman shot up the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas.  58 dead, 851 injured.   

Bump stocks are still legal.
4896 2018-02-15 03:07:11 You accept blood money from the NRA.  You and every rep who votes the NRA agenda are responsible for lives lost in mass shootings.  Individual ownership of assault rifles/bump stocks are not protected under the Constitution. You represent the NRA, not your district. Disgraceful.
4897 2018-02-15 03:06:51 After Vegas, Congress couldn't even get their shit together enough to ban bump stocks. As in NO-OTHER-PURPOSE-BUT-TO-KILL-FOR-SPORT- BUMP-STOCKS. 

I hate that they've already answered this question the wrong way, but is money really more sacred than human life?
4898 2018-02-15 03:06:50 The worst part of all these school shootings: sales of semiautomatic weapons and bump stocks are through the roof. But hey, #thoughtsandprayers from a #fecklessCongress
4899 2018-02-15 03:06:30 Isn't it nice that our international reputation is that of laughing stocks as a result of the beetrooter and his shenanigans, Turnbull should have stepped forward and acted as a PM should but alas he hasn't the balls to do so, overall a very sad situation, thanks fellas.
4900 2018-02-15 03:06:15 The Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 was allowed to expire, despite DEM efforts to renew it, in 2004 by the GOP controlled Senate and House. ALL these mass carnage shootings involve the AR-15. BAN ASSAULT RIFLES, BUMP STOCKS, LARGE CLIPS, AND SILENCERS NOW!!!
4901 2018-02-15 03:06:03 Watch their stocks go up again. This country was built on evil greed by building the economy through chattel slavery. Now in 2018 they still profit off of the pain and death of the American people via the NRA and Gun companies.
4902 2018-02-15 03:05:41 @SenateDems ban assault rifles and bump stocks now
4903 2018-02-15 03:05:33 Retest will come, but not with 10 yr around 2.90ish. Real rate too low. So wouldn’t be rotating out of stocks.

further out if we get 3-4 hikes priced in full & hints economy is slowing than watch out.

Have no idea when, imho earliest March, latest late summer to early Fall.
4904 2018-02-15 03:05:06 I guess anything is better than acknowledging that conservatives haven’t suggested one damn thing to address this issue.  How is legislation on those bump stocks coming along?
4905 2018-02-15 03:04:56 everyone says gun control but no explanation as to what things need control so here's my ideas for control why does a gun need to be able to hold 30 bullets, why are bump stocks manufactured (these help turn something that left the manufacturing company as a semi
4906 2018-02-15 03:04:41 Why we like market corrections:

While Jesse Livermore goes fishing, we go hunting ... for leading stocks.
4907 2018-02-15 03:04:36 I’m amazed at how quick Congress passed a bill to protect athletes from sex abuse because of the NASSER conviction, but haven’t passed anything to prevent the sell of bump stocks that KILL!
4908 2018-02-15 03:04:25 it's not a demo. vs republican. issue, it's about what should be done now to protect our citizens from mass murders, bump stocks banned enforced, etc. follow other countries lead that don't have mass shootings since they changed gun laws austrailia, do something serious.

Don't just throw up your hands, as a father, I can't accept that
4911 2018-02-15 03:03:41 Not on a massive scale with bump stocks or in high schools
4912 2018-02-15 03:03:28 I’m gonna take a guess and say it was a good day to own gun related stocks. If that fact doesn’t point out how fucked up things are I don’t know what does.

4915 2018-02-15 03:02:40 When you and your colleagues are talking about stocks and sad that you didn’t take a chance on Now!! It’s going up!! Are we gonna take the ride? 
4916 2018-02-15 03:02:28 Fuck your sensible legislation ideas.

Ban AR-15s. 

Ban magazines. 

Ban bump stocks. 

Ban all that other shit you need to compensate for your micropenis. 

Fuck the @NRA 

Fuck the @GOP
4917 2018-02-15 03:02:13 Zero gun control and on 4 October 2017 US senator Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill to ban bump stocks but as of November 3, 2017, no Congressional action had resulted.
4918 2018-02-15 03:02:08 Screw your thoughts & prayers. Get assault rifles, bump stocks out of people's hands. Enough!!! #GunControlNow
4919 2018-02-15 03:02:03 Maybe outlawing certain gun types or bump stocks would be a start. Maybe monitor ammo purchases (but I can’t picture how they would do that).You have to start with compromises and go from there.
4920 2018-02-15 03:01:08 #GunControlNow <--So this will trend for a few hours...& then fade until the next time.

Remember how congress talked about banning bump stocks after Las Vegas? Uh huh...that's been forgotten.
4921 2018-02-15 03:01:08 When will you be introducing a Gun Control Bill? Military grade weapons, bumps stocks, large magazines should not be legal in general public. #guncontrolnow
4922 2018-02-15 03:00:16 Great glad to hear you would support gun laws but the outcry you’re hearing is because when sensible legislation is proposed (background checks, banning bumper stocks, etc) it goes nowhere and then this happens again.  Be part of some solution, not inaction.
4923 2018-02-15 03:00:00 I’m old enough to remember the Vegas shooting and how republicans were supposedly open to banning bump stocks.
4924 2018-02-15 02:59:39 So this has done in common sense gun laws forever? We can't even get a ban on bump stocks now.
4925 2018-02-15 02:57:28 It was only in July that Americans were grieving and fuming over a gun man who killed 50 people in under 15 minutes into a Las Vegas concert. 
Congress couldn't even put a damper on bump stocks.
4926 2018-02-15 02:57:05 I agree. I don't own guns and perhaps I don't understand, but I can't see why civilians need guns that can fire more than about 5 rounds of ammunition. And our government hasn't even been able to ban bump stocks. The NRA seems to rule.
4927 2018-02-15 02:57:00 You don't need an AR15 to defend yourself. There is no reason for a civilian to have a semi automatic weapon or modifiers/ bump stocks to make them semis. Your argument is old and tired.
4928 2018-02-15 02:56:33 are you serious?  no wonder we are doomed. views like this.  how about an awesome and necessary response like banning assault rifles and bump stocks.
4929 2018-02-15 02:56:12 I’ve got rights too. You don’t need Kevlar piercing bump stocks, huge magazines etc. We need more mental health care. Keep your gun just help get rid of WMD’s. It’s a start
4930 2018-02-15 02:56:11 I am a gun owner too & have been for most of my 59 years although what’s been happening is outrageous! NRA is deplorable! We don’t need military type guns or bump stocks on the street. Or folks with enough guns & ammo to arm a militia!
4931 2018-02-15 02:55:56 #ethanol had a nice run today due to lower production and lower stocks.  Regardless, USDA estimate for #corn to ethanol is still too low.  New production capacity coming online in a few months wont just go away.
4932 2018-02-15 02:55:46 Stocks in the news: Ambuja Cements, Idea Cellular, Zee Learn, Nestle, Infibeam, Andhra Bank.
4933 2018-02-15 02:55:42 Remember that banning bump stocks wouldn't lower gun fatalities by even 1%. Setting up strawman for political purposes, on the backs of dead kids, is pretty gross.

What's your plan for lowering gun deaths by 25%? 50%?

That's what I thought.
4934 2018-02-15 02:55:34 Taking the stance that other people are talking about outlawing all guns is preposterous. They are referring specifically to assault weapons. The second amendment was written prior to bump stocks, automatic weapons and 37 round clips. If you need thirty seven rounds to hunt...

4937 2018-02-15 02:54:23 Please call for reinstating #AssaultWeaponsBan include bump stocks, magazines & anything that turns a weapon into a killing machine. We must be specific & deliberate.
4938 2018-02-15 02:53:48 This.  So much this.  Ban assault rifles, high capacity clips, and bump stocks.  Quit the bull shit navel gazing we get from conservatives every. time. this. happens.
4939 2018-02-15 02:53:43 AR-15 Military style weapons should not be legal.  A good first step, along with banning bump stocks and silencers.
4940 2018-02-15 02:53:42 First I would push efforts to regulate bump stocks and other conversions in the same way suppressor are regulated.
4941 2018-02-15 02:53:37 Say you get your way,: AR-15s are banned, taken and destroyed. Everyone has to pass a background check, no more bump stocks. and no fly no buy is put into effect. What do you do the next day when they get a background check, pass, and buy a mini-14 and shoot up the school?
4942 2018-02-15 02:53:37 Thanks! Do you mind putting a list of stocks you are long in
4943 2018-02-15 02:53:35 From the left: Ban guns
From the right: 2nd amendment 

How about:
Secure background checks for all
Ban bump stocks & military style weapons
Fully funding mental health
Taking guns away from crazies
I'm tired of the senseless deaths
 
Can't we meet in the middle & do something?
4944 2018-02-15 02:53:30 laughing ! they are Laughing suckers we'll never tell the @NRA we're outlawing AK15 type weapons from civilian use, Bump Stocks ? who cares not us. limiting large ammo magazines.. who cares not @POTUS not @FLGovScott we like it just the way it is the #NRAKills keeps us in office
4945 2018-02-15 02:53:25 #LT both have strict gun laws and still high murder rates. Even if you do put a stop to AR’s or semi’s and bump stocks, those guns still will find a way into USA, from where?? Mexico.
4946 2018-02-15 02:52:59 The NRA will lie and tell us we need more guns to stop it. Gun stocks will soar tomorrow out of fear of some form of legislation. The industry continues to profit from fear and ignorance.
4947 2018-02-15 02:52:58 Common sense is ban gun stocks, assault  weapons 
 and provide mental health access
#Hannity #NoMore
4948 2018-02-15 02:52:45 Also, the strange idea that trigger locks, high-capacity clips, hollow-points, back-ground checks, or even bump-stocks can't be discussed for fear the constitution will burst into flames.
4949 2018-02-15 02:52:10 I love how you somehow stay away from those shit stocks that alot of people get burned on, like ZN, FOSL, AND CATB yesterday

4951 2018-02-15 02:51:25 You have no idea what you're talking about, unfortunately.  Paul Ryan sabotaged any legislation on bump stocks when he kicked it to the ATF as a regulatory issue when in fact, the ATF has NO jurisdiction.  
Regarding stats on NRA donations to GOP: FACTS have no party affiliation.
4952 2018-02-15 02:51:22 Sandy Hook meant nothing to congress.  This will mean even less.  They would not even touch bump stocks.
4953 2018-02-15 02:51:11 Is it just me or is btc and us stocks looking very similar lately?
4954 2018-02-15 02:51:03 I have never seen what was used. Was it an AR-15? I think that bump stocks and anything else that recycles the trigger quickly should be banned.
4955 2018-02-15 02:50:56 Today in GOP Kansas.  As democrats we know what to do first when we oust the GOP....sensible gun laws.  No bump stocks, no assault rifles, limits on ammunition, enhanced background checks and waiting periods.
4956 2018-02-15 02:50:16 5.56 is a round not a gun. Same as a 3003 or 3006 or 308 all army standards at one time. The AR-15 is limited to 5 round magazine in Canada and no more dangerous than any hunting/sporting rifle. US very different with 30 round+ magazines, bump stocks, etc.
4957 2018-02-15 02:49:57 Bump stocks do not increase the maximum firing rate. Bump stock or not, the AR-15s cannot fire faster than 45 rounds per minute.
4958 2018-02-15 02:49:41 Bump stocks do not increase the maximum firing rate. Bump stock or not, the AR-15s cannot fire faster than 45 rounds per minute.
4959 2018-02-15 02:49:33 If Newtown and Las Vegas weren't enough to even get @GOP to act on bump stocks, I'm not holding my breath on this one effecting any changes to impact the glaring elephant in the room. Military style weapons freely available without conditions. Sick of platitudes. ~A constituent.
4960 2018-02-15 02:49:32 NRA BLOODMONEY!!!!  BUMP STOCKS!!!  BLOODY AND NO CLEAR NEED!
4961 2018-02-15 02:49:13 Massachusetts recently banned bump stocks. It's a start.
4962 2018-02-15 02:49:07 Bump stocks do not increase the maximum firing rate. Bump stock or not, the AR-15s cannot fire faster than 45 rounds per minute.
4963 2018-02-15 02:48:57 I MENTIONED BUMP STOCKS AND YOU DIDN'T CORRECT ME, now did you? Your excuse is LAME! They shouldn't have them because the only reason they would is to either KILL people, doing other illegal things or to compensate for a small dick. You got it? The End!
4964 2018-02-15 02:48:20 Why didn’t you hammer agent orange when U interviewed him. His office stated very clearly they would ban “bump stocks” u know they have done nothing since Las Vegas tragedy. Absolutely nothing!! A shame.
4965 2018-02-15 02:48:19 Does it seem odd that the Roths sell stocks and property and since Soros pulled his funds into his charity accounts so they wouldn't be seized. And then HRC goes on TV and shit starts? And immediately they start the gun control lobby? I know we're following the money but wow!

4978 2018-02-15 02:46:35 Instead of praying, do something, stand for the people of this country instead of the NRA and the money they gave you.  We need responsible gun legislation that will help prevent what is happening.  What happened to banning bump stocks??? The Republicans are worthless
4979 2018-02-15 02:46:30 Bump stocks do not increase the maximum firing rate. Bump stock or not, the AR-15s cannot fire faster than 45 rounds per minute.
4980 2018-02-15 02:46:29 The NRA is complicit. We had the worst mass shooting in HISTORY in Vegas and the shills on the hill could not even vote to ban bump stocks. Not a weapon but an enhancement to a weapon   It’s pathetic
4981 2018-02-15 02:46:13 You're absolutely correct we learn that from the Vegas shooting how to turn a gun into semi-automatic rifle use a bump stock. Something I thought I would never know but I do now ban bump stocks ban semi-automatic rifles
4982 2018-02-15 02:46:07 AR-15s need to be banned. Bump stocks need to be banned.
4983 2018-02-15 02:45:57 It seems like the idea of your rights end where mine begin might have a place in the gun debate. I have the right to live & if your right to have bump stocks/semi-automatic weapon endangers my right to live AT A SCHOOL 18 times in 45 days, my right to live might be the priority.
4984 2018-02-15 02:45:54 やっぱり無理
4985 2018-02-15 02:45:54 Didn't know advocating against bump-stocks wasn't "sensible gun control"?
4986 2018-02-15 02:45:11 I remember when these shootings happened under the first Bush.
Remember the Brady bill? 
My dad bought and sold firearms most of my youth. Used to take the wood stocks off SKS’, replace them with black plastic ones, and you could sell them for more. 
Brady bill killed those.
4987 2018-02-15 02:44:51 Go 100% stocks & ride it out!
4988 2018-02-15 02:44:48 Well, you couldn't even ban bump stocks and that would have made a difference in Las Vegas.  Just admit it....you don't give a damn as long as you are getting paid to promote gun violence.
4989 2018-02-15 02:44:40 Bump stocks are still legal too. A teacher was shot and killed while trying to close the door to the classroom- Died trying to protect students, which is something @GOP lawmakers have never tried to do.
4990 2018-02-15 02:44:19 Yes,  which need to be banned. Bump stocks I am saying.
4991 2018-02-15 02:44:15 How about banning bump stocks a hole?
4992 2018-02-15 02:43:56 I’m a gun owner and politically Independent. It’s time to strictly regulate assault weapons. A mandatory 10 year sentence high felony for possession of a rifle or shotgun clip that holds more than 7 -10 shots. No Bump stocks This is fucking ridiculous. Something needs to be done
4993 2018-02-15 02:43:29 Remember when we all agreed that bump stocks should be outlawed? Remember that? Remember how far that went?

I’m just so sad that we’ve accepted this as status quo. Lather, rinse, repeat.
4994 2018-02-15 02:43:05 I'm old enough to remember when a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas using a bump stock (which effectively turns a semi-automatic into a fully automatic) & Congress couldn't even be bothered to ban bump stocks.
4995 2018-02-15 02:42:51 Actually, the only reason we have this country is because of France. Not AR 15s and bump stocks.
4996 2018-02-15 02:42:38 Are assault weapons needed to protect yourself?
No
Are they needed to hunt?
No
Are bump stocks needed for personal protection or hunting?
No
Gun Control is needed.
No One is saying repeal 2nd
We want to repeal stupid.
4997 2018-02-15 02:42:30 But you do tolerate violence. You allow the sale of AR-15s, bump stocks...so you actually condone it.
4998 2018-02-15 02:42:24 Bump stocks are also what made the Vegas shooting so deadly. But NOTHING WAS DONE. NOTHING.
4999 2018-02-15 02:42:20 @Nidhi  Looks like you have good experience & stocks. 
5000 2018-02-15 02:42:17 Mass shootings are great for the gun lobbyists. After Las Vegas the sell of bump stocks skyrocketed. I'm sure they will sell many AR 15's tomorrow. And the next copycat has been inspired. It's a vicious, deadly cycle.
5001 2018-02-15 02:41:49 In Florida visiting family, stopped by BassPro Shop last week to grab fishing gear. Walked through the gun section to see AR-15s, bump stocks, and clips holding 30 bullets. Right in front of my eyes, I saw the tools of destruction that are unnecessary for hunting or home safety.
5002 2018-02-15 02:41:47 Actually one thing does change. The stocks of gun manufacturers go up. The same politicians that sit on their hands while people are shot. Make money in the markets because of those shootings.
5003 2018-02-15 02:41:45 When your stocks are up but your weight is as well.
5004 2018-02-15 02:41:43 Antifa or whatever racist group has killed people in mass shootings are NRA members they buy these rifles and bump stocks that the NRA promote, so therefore your member just by buying these weapons. It’s crazy 17 die and you defend NRA,white racists,say democrats also to blame.
5005 2018-02-15 02:41:32 only if you wouldva banned bump stocks before!!!!
5006 2018-02-15 02:41:27 Side note...in regards to Parkland, Florida...how insane are you to believe that no form of Gun Control or Gun Deterrents (of any kind) would have mattered if you refuse to enact anything in the first place? Bump stocks after Vegas were still legal, and yet we have now the...
5007 2018-02-15 02:41:17 Here are some: Ban AR 15's, ban bump stocks, eliminate person to person gun sales/gifts without background checks, make sure those convicted on domestic violence have to turn in current guns, make sure they have to to turn them into law enforcement (not family and friends)
5008 2018-02-15 02:41:04 How about you work with Congress on banning the AR-15. It has been used in so many shootings. If you want to make america great again, start with protecting american lives at home. BAN the gun & BAN bump stocks
5009 2018-02-15 02:40:15 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
5010 2018-02-15 02:40:02 A handful of patience is worth a bushel of brains - Dutch Proverb. #stocks #investing
5011 2018-02-15 02:39:59 I was in NFLX - CAT - NVDA and closed out worried about market going down today. Looked like genius when cpi came out and then later all 3 stocks ran. Lost out on 2k profit potential. Need to listen more to Sam then CNBC
5012 2018-02-15 02:39:55 I think you should show the victims in situ. This might make the 2nd amendment freaks get off their duff and demand a ban on automatic weapons and bump stocks.
5013 2018-02-15 02:39:50 For the record, AR-15's aren't fully automatic. AR stands for armalite, it's bump stocks that make em automatic.

Still no reason for it tho
5014 2018-02-15 02:39:46 How much money have you taken from the NRA?  Don’t bother expressing sympathy—it is meaningless when you do nothing to keep people from buying bump stocks and automatic weapons and then slaughtering children.
5015 2018-02-15 02:39:45 The Atomic Energy Act. I can afford a fully auto machine too but that freedom is restricted also. ALL freedoms are limited. But zero debate after every tragedy ... bump stocks still unrestricted.
5016 2018-02-15 02:39:27 No need for AR 15 in public hands.   Sure your gonna find them... start making them illegal and hopefully it’s tougher for high school seniors to get their hands on them.  I have no issues with guns but bump stocks and silencers for AR 15s goes to far
5017 2018-02-15 02:39:19 remember when after the Las Vegas shooting the Republican leaders in Congress said that they were going to take swift action to ban bump stocks? 
That shooting happened on Oct. 1.
5018 2018-02-15 02:39:10 If there was money to be made in it, you know he had his cash in the game. Defense stocks, baby.
5019 2018-02-15 02:38:58 @senmarcorubio please go crawl back under your rock.  No solution is perfect but bump stocks, AR-15’s, BAN THEM, it’s a start!  No one NEEDS  either of them.  NO ONE.
5020 2018-02-15 02:38:55 In eight days no one will care. This is the NRA model. Remember bumper stocks after Las Vegas? How did that legislation go? We as Americans need to wake up!

5023 2018-02-15 02:38:20 You legislators better do something or get the hell out! Dem or Rep? I do not care. Ban bump stocks and AR or I will work to oust you all!NRA money gonna he you sleep tonight?
5024 2018-02-15 02:38:13 Good sentiment from a man who won’t introduce or support legislation banning bump stocks. Which is the least that @TeamDean @DeanHeller could do. But no, let’s hear all about your “heartbreak” for Parkland and #VegasStrong. It must hurt so much.  #pooryou
5025 2018-02-15 02:38:12 well, it's not even guns being LESS available
NO need for automatic weapons
at all
unless you're IN the military
NO need for BUMP STOCKS
need for BACKGROUND checks, ALWAYS
mentally ill should NOT OWN GUNS
etc
etc
etc
5026 2018-02-15 02:38:12 Italian stocks gonna get wrecked
5027 2018-02-15 02:38:06 I can't agree more!They are all spineless puppets of the NRA and R W Radicals! Brainwashed people to believe if controls are put on AR-15's & Bump Stocks then Gov't will take all our guns away! As a gun owner&family of gun owners, that's ridiculous! USA wouldn't let that happen!
5028 2018-02-15 02:37:33 Assault rifles are a myth?  And bump stocks?  Huh?
5029 2018-02-15 02:37:28 No one is advocating we take everyone’s guns. What we want is sensible reform like banning unnecessary accessories, like bump stocks and 100-round magazines, and banning military grade assault weapons, which have been used time and time again in these mass shootings.
5030 2018-02-15 02:37:22 Congress must be so annoyed that there was another mass shooting before they ever even got around to banning bump stocks! Whoops.
5031 2018-02-15 02:37:04 Do bump stocks come with those new AR-15s?
5032 2018-02-15 02:36:59 @marcorubio It’s past time to fix this. How can your conscience let you sleep?? Someone in GOP needs to be the Hero. NO AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. NO BUMP STOCKS. WHY can’t YOU save the kids and innocents?  Stand up and be a man.
5033 2018-02-15 02:35:53 Obviously prayers aren’t working. Have you considered creating a task force to tackle the problem? Voting for mandatory background checks, banning bump stocks, or closing loopholes? DO SOMETHING!

5037 2018-02-15 02:34:32 And she'll have earned plenty of money from NRA for re election. They can afford a fe w funerals etc for what they make off this. Gun stocks went up alot this afternoon.
5038 2018-02-15 02:34:32 #MAGA @NRA doesn't care about automatics, and bump stocks, or any other accessory kit to turn regular guns into automatics, They don't care about how these things add to the death count, they just care about the bottom line, the profit.
5039 2018-02-15 02:33:37 Passing bills that allow mentally disturbed and domestic abusers and terrorists to buy guns is crazy and wreckless.Bump stocks and assault rifles belong in combat zones not school zones.
5040 2018-02-15 02:33:36 please advise her if u can to obtain a lawyer to represent all victims in class action law suit against fed. govt for not protecting them they have done nothing to ban AR15 or bump stocks or changes to prevent mass shootings, it's their job, they are negligent.
Please ..

5042 2018-02-15 02:32:49 Tired of the empty prayers and “nothing we can do” attitude! Background checks, licenses, buyback programs, child locks! Close loopholes! Ban military-style assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, silencers, concealed carry! UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE! Silence = Death.
5043 2018-02-15 02:32:45 One of my #ValentinesDay gifts was looking through the wifey's new eligible IRA retirement program... love digging into the fees and matching details!  #Stocks
5044 2018-02-15 02:32:45 NRA has decreed we MUST have bump stocks and AR15s and other MILITARY style assault rifles -- 'coz that way "hunters" will bring home chopped meat when they shoot a deer
5045 2018-02-15 02:32:34 Please to see u agree on bump stocks.  Maybe that’s a start to some sensible legislation that could save lives?
5046 2018-02-15 02:32:21 True. But there are things you can do to make this less likely: better registration, more education, banning bump stocks and severely restricting who can own semiautomatics would be a start.
5047 2018-02-15 02:32:13 If you're so sad, then introduce legislation to stop this! Semi-auto rifle sales, 30 round clips, bump stocks, ad infinitum. Right to bear is fine, but no one needs 'assault' weapons
5048 2018-02-15 02:32:12 @Agpambondi You have to speak to Gun Control! AR-15 weapons should only be available to the military and law enforcement! Bump stocks, assault weapons, automatic weapons are not needed in a safe America!!
5049 2018-02-15 02:31:36 Ban military grade automatic weapons and bumper stocks.
5050 2018-02-15 02:31:31 I respect your opinion but keep in mind, one trigger pull equals one bullet no matter what the weapon including an AR15, unless it's been illegally modified ( and I'm all for banning "bump stocks")
5051 2018-02-15 02:31:19 You're not getting elected again, and we will fidn out what companies you hold stock in and boycott them, and tell all of the stockholders as long as you're involved thier stocks are going to plummet..too late! You're done! Spineless little man!
5052 2018-02-15 02:31:00 Watch the gun and ammo stocks tomorrow. The knuckle draggers will be stocking up. Then they’ll go down, when nothing happens.
5053 2018-02-15 02:30:59 Banning assault weapons would do little to stop shootings. It is somewhat easy for people to mod guns to make them military caliber.  Many mass shootings like the Adam Lanza shooting used modified pistols with Bump stocks, not AK-47s.
5054 2018-02-15 02:30:48 Give them a year they will go up again! Time to stocks 
5055 2018-02-15 02:30:45 Bump stocks. How many people were shot to pieces in Las Vegas?
5056 2018-02-15 02:30:41 Joe, please start something, even if Ryan won’t bring it to the floor. Craft a bill. Ban ar15s, bump stocks, large mags, ammo/guns caches. Do universal background checks, no fly - no guns, restricted sales, mental awareness. Stop the slaughter of our children in their schools.
5057 2018-02-15 02:30:33 Soon: Buy your kids more bump stocks! No one would have died if those kids had enough bump stocks!
5058 2018-02-15 02:30:27 And bump stocks aren’t the tip of the iceberg.  They are a flake on it.  A #GunCult culture of violence, pandering media, bought out politicians, and normalizing the crisis just sets it up so bump stocks can be  a focus while nothing is done.  #BrokenCountry
5059 2018-02-15 02:29:50 Minority party. Cannot get legislation to the floor without Mitch and Paul.Couldn't even get bump stocks banned after Vegas. It's on gop NRA
5060 2018-02-15 02:29:34 "We need time to pray and heal" is Republicans coded speak for "Shit happens ". So over seeing these tragedies and NOTHING happen! No desire to even TRY to solve the problem. Did they even bother to outlaw bump stocks after Vegas like they said they would?
5061 2018-02-15 02:29:24 Lol where the fuck did bump stocks come into this convo?  You literally only know about 3 words when it comes to guns and that’s one of them.
5062 2018-02-15 02:29:09 Seen on FB, and it's a fantastic idea. Children of the United States - Save Yourself. Do not accept this. Refuse to go to school until Congress acts to ban assault weapons, bump stocks, etc., etc. Congress will not help you. You must demand that Congress takes action.
5063 2018-02-15 02:29:06 I am a veteran and a 2nd amendment person ,But ! Assault weapons and bump stocks HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE FOR THE CIVILIAN WORLD !  WE DONT NEED THOSE!
5064 2018-02-15 02:29:05 Lmfaoo  that’s a good one lmao but no it’s because of stocks and business taxes I had to pay

5066 2018-02-15 02:28:02 @Sen. Bill Nelson. We have said enough is enough.  We got shut out by our government due to @NRA donations.  It’s time forYOU and you colleagues to get your act together. Outlaw AR-15, bump stocks, ammo clips. NOW!
5067 2018-02-15 02:27:49 @donlemon 
Another mass shooting! When does it stop? Your government Puts people's 2nd Ammendments over children's and American citizens lives!!! We hunt in Canada,  we don't need AR15 or bump stocks!  When are parents going to say enough is enough??
5068 2018-02-15 02:27:42 What has he done about bump stocks?
5069 2018-02-15 02:26:11 @cybercash28 ya this is going back near $3 again. Just look at big  banking stocks. $JPM $BAC $WFC $C
5070 2018-02-15 02:26:01 Well automatic weapons are the most heavily regulated weapons there are, and it’s nearly impossible to get a new one. Agree on bump stocks. So no target shooting with pistols?
5071 2018-02-15 02:26:01 We have to focus on the automatic rifles & bump stocks. That will not affect the 2nd amendment.
5072 2018-02-15 02:26:00 Also I completely agree with mental health checks and am actually good with tax deductible purchases of safes. But we should also make background checks mandatory on all sales and automatic weapons/shit like bump stocks should be banned.  They're unnecessary.

5077 2018-02-15 02:24:03 1. What makes you think your guns can stop well equipped govt force?  Cmon
2. I don’t see the confiscators exactly comin at ya.  Keep ur pistols, bolt actions and shotguns!  But assault weapons, giant magazines, bump stocks and armor piercing bullets sorry but those r 4 murder.
5078 2018-02-15 02:23:53 4/ 
7. Make civilian body armor illegal.
8. Make bump stocks illegal.
9. Make some assault rifles illegal.

5081 2018-02-15 02:23:33 Close loopholes.

5083 2018-02-15 02:22:53 Lots of "law-abiding" gun owners also love to talk about how they’d never abide by new gun laws they don’t agree with. Even on issues like bump stocks, that appeared to be a popular refrain. Not sure if they mean it, but it seems strange nonetheless.
5084 2018-02-15 02:22:35 I have a problem with both, their designed purpose, and the mag capacity.  I am not opposed to guns, don't own any at this point, but have in the past.  And yes I have a problem with bump stocks.

5087 2018-02-15 02:22:20 "Well what should we do?" they ask.

Outlaw bump stocks, or any device that similarly increases the rate of fire. Outlaw high-capacity mags. Close gun show loopholes. Have universal background checks. This won't stop all violence, but it'll greatly help. #GunControlNow #Parkland
5088 2018-02-15 02:21:47 Approved sale of Bump stocks were do to an ATF interpretation of law. "We find that the bump stock is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act," ATF said. 
Trump rescinded EO’s making it easy for mentally ill to buy guns
5089 2018-02-15 02:21:26 Congress not only won't act on another ban,but have the nerve to not act on bump stocks and introduced  H.R. 367 in 2017. That bill is to make suppressors (silencers) legal! Jokingly calling it the Hearing Protection Act!
5090 2018-02-15 02:20:58 I will never vote for any candidate who has taken a penny in donations from the NRA or who does not support common sense gun laws...starting with prohibition of bump stocks, increased restrictions on assault weapon ownership & monitoring ammo sales. @SenatorWicker @CongPalazzo
5091 2018-02-15 02:20:50 How about the fact not one of these mass shootings have ever had a machine gun. Bump stocks do not make a gun a machine gun.
5092 2018-02-15 02:20:11 I think your point “1. peak” business is:who what is the incremental customer for the services FAANG provides. 2. Peak stocks: who is the incremental buyer of the names. Figure out the first you have the other. I think the 10 percent down was due to the second. Num 1 next
5093 2018-02-15 02:20:07 And all that talk after Las Vegas about outlawing bump stocks? Never happened.  Surprise, surprise, surprise
5094 2018-02-15 02:20:00 You realize the arguments you are making aren’t ones I’m trying to refute right? But since you brought up bump stocks you realize you can make a bump stock out of a belt right? You can make a bump stock out of almost literally anything.
5095 2018-02-15 02:19:44 We don’t need prayers. The country needs action by the corrupt Washington politicians including yourself. All bought and paid for by the NRA. Ban assault rifles, bump stocks, extended magazines and improve background checks.
5096 2018-02-15 02:18:45 I bot that in my investment account and doing well.  I do better on picking the investment stocks than the lower priced stocks I want to flip.

If you can’t get behind measures that restrict or bans ARs, mags, bump stocks etc., then stay home. #Parkland #2ndAmendment #BREAKING
5099 2018-02-15 02:17:26 And continue to support semiautomatic weapons, bump stocks, and of course the almighty NRA.
5100 2018-02-15 02:17:12 that's one reason why I made sure not to own stocks that went down over 54% during the 2007-09 crash...hopefully the stocks I have won't go down more than 54% if we get a similar crash...also, having a hedge helps
5101 2018-02-15 02:17:08 And what about those bump stocks...? Faded into oblivion.
5102 2018-02-15 02:16:59 Here’s a start, a debate! Tragic events happen&prayers given but not even a debate or amendments proposed legislatively for ideas. Congress won’t even fund studies for gun control or gun violence. Bump stocks, why? Clips with 20rds or more, why? AR15, why? Universal BGC,why not?
5103 2018-02-15 02:16:40 Don’t just pray!!!! Act. Ban assault rifles, bump stocks, extended magazines and improve background checks. Do your job!!!!
5104 2018-02-15 02:16:21 Start with assault weapons and bump stocks. No more gun expos. If you want a gun, 3 day background check. Better data on mental health and quicker response and care to those who need it. Start somewhere,  do something,  try something, but DO NOT DO NOTHING. This has to end, NOW!
5105 2018-02-15 02:16:02 Selling military grade assault rifles or legal modifications to make retular rifles fully automatic, bump stocks etc. have noting to do with 2nd amendment. You wanna buy one pistol? Do it. One rifle for hunting? Buy it. The rest is NRA’s bull shit
#floridaschoolshooting
5106 2018-02-15 02:16:01 ATF ruled they did not have the authority to regulate gun bump stocks because the National Firearms Act, passed in 1934, did not allow it. So the law would have to be changed to prevent the sales.

Think the GOP would stop sucking on the @NRA teet long enough to change the law?
5107 2018-02-15 02:15:49 because stocks don't work that way
5108 2018-02-15 02:15:46 And the bump stock argument that has been publicized a lot lately is pretty ridiculous. You can use your thumb, a seatbelt, or anything with a bit of resistance to make a gun do what bump stocks do. Shooting a gun that way isn’t very accurate—a waste of ammo, basically.
5109 2018-02-15 02:15:44 Constitution doesn’t say anything about Semi automatic weapons and bump stocks. Pleas educate yourself.
5110 2018-02-15 02:15:29 The NRA is usually conservative and I always thought they own most of the stocks on wallstreet for guns.

But if one gun dealer is a democrat than it's all cool.
5111 2018-02-15 02:15:28 Thoughts and prayers are not enough. Too many school shootings this year. Stand up like a man and urge Congress to pass better background checks, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, and close gun show loopholes!!!  That would be a fantastic start. SAVE OUR CHILDREN!!
5112 2018-02-15 02:15:23 The Broward cop saying that people should call when they see something out of the ordinary:

5113 2018-02-15 02:15:19 JIM, time to stop the BS about stocks & the market and stat coming down on the GOP/NRA GUN LOBBY and address gun control in America. Children are being massacred in schools every day. This is a GOP ISSUE. Enough with the stock BS already. Talk about what really matters.
5114 2018-02-15 02:15:14 Return the background check for fbi to 7 days, ban bump stocks, limit lobbyist campaign contributions #guncontrol
5115 2018-02-15 02:15:02 By passing common sense gun bills. Do we really need bump-stocks accessories or other devices for rapid fire.  How much ammunition should each person be allocated without documentation? Have you tried getting Sudafed from a pharmacy? Locked up behind counter, ID, signed tracking.
5116 2018-02-15 02:14:17 He has an energy investment background, mainly being managing portfolios and buying/trading energy stocks.  He sits on no boards outside of Crew SC and MLS.  Has run no businesses, or invested in a start up before.  It shows.
5117 2018-02-15 02:13:53 Just what every young woman needs to go with her pink AR. What happened to all the push back on these bump-stocks? What happened to banning these?
5118 2018-02-15 02:13:39 I don’t want your thoughts &prayers. I want courage & integrity ( I know that’s a stretch if even possible for you). Address the real issues background checks (which your budget cots by16%) banning assault weapons & bump stocks. O
5119 2018-02-15 02:13:30 @realDonaldTrump  so sick of hearing about thoughts &prayers,grief counseling,unbelievable tragedy,pure evil etc.,there is no reason 4 ordinary citizens to have access to semiautomatic guns or bump stocks. Only the military needs semi or automatic guns PERIOD
5120 2018-02-15 02:13:29 You cannot twist facts like this, though.  Most mass shootings, including school shootings, use 9mm handguns or bushmaster rifles.  AR-15s are very rarely used, and bump stocks have only been used in maybe 1 shooting, that being Las Vegas.
5121 2018-02-15 02:13:24 We need more eyes on this one. $FRFS ran to .07. Just today $EMAV ran to 3 cents on just one 13g filing.
5122 2018-02-15 02:13:14 Does anyone else find it kind of amazing that it's apparently difficult to ban a thing like bump-stocks? I mean really?
And I'm personally not even much interested in gun control as an issue.
5123 2018-02-15 02:12:50 I am a Democrat.  I do not mock prayer.  I do not mock God.  I do not mock millions of God-fearing, law abiding gun owners. I do, however, dislike those who believe assault rifles, bump stocks, and poor regulation of gun ownership are okay. I also mock those who generalize.
5124 2018-02-15 02:12:05 I respond with 'bullets and bump stocks'
5125 2018-02-15 02:12:05 The animal who comitted this horrific act owns this. Didn’t see any scary bump stocks used today.
5126 2018-02-15 02:11:50 Sen, Feinstein tried to ban the bump stock, didn't work. AR-15 & similar are not automatic rifles, but maybe it's time to ban these types of weapons &bump stocks. You don't hunt with them. Maybe just have them at gun ranges if people need to shoot them. It's time to save lives.
5127 2018-02-15 02:11:35 It is time for everyone to stand up and be counted!  Ban assault weapons and bump stocks, close gun show loopholes, and better background checks would be a fantastic start!  Not just lip service!
5128 2018-02-15 02:11:30 C’mon Marco. This Floridian (who proudly voted for you) expects something more from you than that.  Time for you to go after some low hanging fruit.  Bump stocks should be an easy one and might give you some encouragement to do something profound.
5129 2018-02-15 02:11:03 Today was an epic day for the #Inflation trade... Zero time to tweet earliar. The reversal post CPI was one of the best sessions we will see in a while for short U.S. Dollar trades and long #Stocks #Commodities & #FX.
5130 2018-02-15 02:10:58 Remember the Vegas Shooting? The NRA went to the table with the gun control "compromise" crowd again over bump stocks. They got wide-sweeping and largely debatable garbage that would not have prevented this at all but would have made criminals out of many. #Awkward #BustedTrust
5131 2018-02-15 02:10:53 Another one! It’s now past time to push aside the NRA bought off GOP and ignorant Trumpsters and keep our children from being murdered in our schools. Ban AR15s, bump stocks, long mags, weapons/ammo caches, etc. OUT the GOP, GET IN DEMS. ACTION IS NEEDED NOW. Stop the slaughter.
5132 2018-02-15 02:10:36 Random fact. The first person to be sentenced to the stocks in colonial Boston was the carpenter who built them as punishment for charging too high a price lol.
5133 2018-02-15 02:10:32 I will never either. Here in MA we have just outlawed bump stocks and trigger cranks. But that's only a start....Right to bear and keep arms never meant personal arsenal or AR-15s.

5135 2018-02-15 02:10:20 Yup. A bill was introduced to make them illegal. Bump stocks have no other use and yet it failed. The NRA is threatened by anything taken away. Even if keeping it defies all logic.
5136 2018-02-15 02:10:14 They’ve introduced assault weapons bans, legislation to ban bump stocks, legislation to close the gun loopholes etc etc.
5137 2018-02-15 02:10:02 My pull out game is weak when it comes to stocks
5138 2018-02-15 02:09:54 Not today friend. School shooting left 17 dead in my hometown today. I’m sick & tired of school shooting ms &  AR 15s multiple magazines bump stocks etc are ALWAYS used! 18th school shooting of 2018, 45 days in! & while I may agree w/u on parenting u know we can’t reply on that
5139 2018-02-15 02:09:54 Agreed. Gold for saving.. not making. Guess what I’m really saying is. Bonds and stocks aren’t going to be friendly.
5140 2018-02-15 02:09:53 It is the unintended consequence of the Hughes Amendment, government can squeeze all it wants, ingenuity will find a way.
Had they kept the registry open, I doubt bump stocks would have ever been invented.
5141 2018-02-15 02:09:50 The fools on the hill haven’t even had the balls to ban bump stocks after Vegas.  They do what the NRA tells them to do.
5142 2018-02-15 02:09:48 Why would you be able to follow such convoluted logic. You buy guns, I buy stocks. As far as pushups go....I don’t need guns to make me feel good. But you clearly do. Giddy.
5143 2018-02-15 02:09:37 At 15 & bump stocks is a start.
5144 2018-02-15 02:09:36 Deadly Fl shooting, Asian stocks @realDonaldTrump US-China trade spat, cap controls holiday @Julesaly @YvonneManTV @news_denise @EdBaxterRadio
5145 2018-02-15 02:09:35 It's not that hard:

1. Ban assault weapons/bump stocks
2. Ban firearm access to violent offenders & people w/mental health problems 
3. Thorough background checks
4. Firearm safety education

No, this will not ELIMINATE gun violence, but I predict it would reduce it. #GunControl
5146 2018-02-15 02:09:28 Or we can stop taking laws off the books that stop mentally ill people from carrying guns. Or how about outlawing bump stocks. We need a combination of things, but I doubt anything happens. All we do is rinse and repeat.
5147 2018-02-15 02:09:01 アエリアはリバると分かっててナンピンできないのホント弱い
5148 2018-02-15 02:09:01 As well, so military style means absolutely nothing. As for bump stocks, can you give me a rounds per minute? Is MG42 fast? Tommy Gun fast? Or STG fast? Because it does not make a semi auto fire close to the rate of an actual automatic weapon.
5149 2018-02-15 02:08:33 imagine not making your own stocks
5150 2018-02-15 02:08:25 How about actually DOING something and enact sensible gun control. Stop accepting #NRA blood money. There is NO reason U.S. civilians need semi-automatic rifles or bump stocks.
5151 2018-02-15 02:07:50 Ban assault weapons and bump stocks, better background checks, and closing gun show loopholes would be a fantastic start!  SAVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN!  Force the NRA into a few concessions!!!
5152 2018-02-15 02:07:18 My state of Massachusetts banned bump stocks. It wasn't hard, and it can save lives. What has GOP Congress done to reduce gun violence? NOTHING. And guess what -- tax cuts don't save lives. Not a single one.
5153 2018-02-15 02:07:17 AR-15's, Bump Stocks
5154 2018-02-15 02:06:48 The problem is neither guns or bump stocks. The problem is progressives and liberals like yourself who have attacked the moral fiber of our country for a century.
5155 2018-02-15 02:06:46 One of my favorite tech dividend stocks!
5156 2018-02-15 02:06:08 @CondoleezzaRice @NASA Mrs. Rice this is Jack's niece again. Could you and Colen get with NASA AGAIN and check on my whole family but don't call Doc.  He's sick.  Stocks, Satellites, and Computers with little purple ones that stay plugged in under NASA desks for little girls
5157 2018-02-15 02:05:39 Well, I don't think anybody needs bump stocks or silencers while we're at it. I don't have all the answers, but I have 3 children myself, and I just want them to go to school without worrying they'll be shot.
5158 2018-02-15 02:05:30 im sorry but the right to bare arms is a bullshit argument against gun control. pretty sure our founding fathers didn’t anticipate people owning automatic weapons and bump stocks when all they had was their muskets that they could be fired 3 or 4 times per minute
5159 2018-02-15 02:05:14 Time for better background checks, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, closing gun show loopholes would be a fantastic start!
5160 2018-02-15 02:04:45 At this point, people can still purchase bump-stocks.  I’m sure those are for hunting too!!!
5161 2018-02-15 02:04:22 Apparently the use of bump stops is not illegal

Are they legal?
While automatic weapons are tightly regulated in the US, the use of bump-fire stocks in semi-automatic weapons is legal.
5162 2018-02-15 02:03:36 Gun stocks and gun sales go up after mass shootings like these. Go figure. This is the country we live in
5163 2018-02-15 02:02:57 Law Enforcement and Intelligence Agencies agree no civilian should possess automatic weapons or bump stocks. 

Democrats agree.

Republicans disagree.

Gun control laws are political because the Republicans make them so.
5164 2018-02-15 02:02:52 Asian stocks advanced early on Thursday, taking cues from the rally on Wall Street.
5165 2018-02-15 02:02:43 Looks like bump fire stocks aren’t the problem #Florida
5166 2018-02-15 02:02:37 Really? I'm a liberal with 2 shotguns and a Luger. I don't need an AR15 or bump stocks or a ready to assemble, by mail, untraceable rifle.  And I don't want your guns. I want common sense laws. Nothing more.
5167 2018-02-15 02:02:36 In this particular instance I'd say it's completely the influence of the NRA money. Remember after the Las Vegas shooting politicians (even GOP) were saying bump stocks should be outlawed... never happened.
5168 2018-02-15 02:02:12 How about the minute you show a interest in purchasing  an AR-15 we throw you in jail, same for bump-stocks and armor piercing ammo?
5169 2018-02-15 02:01:52 I think the ATF is against bump stocks. The NRA agreed to no bump stocks after Las Vegas but reversed. 

The GOP MUST MAN UP.

If they don’t, serve them severe mocking & condemnation. If they create a plan that doesn’t help after 1 yr, HAMMER them for failing & to make a new plan
5170 2018-02-15 02:01:44 I don't know what to say (that hasn't been already) on this day of another American mass shooting.

It just seemed kinda chickenshit to say nothing, esp. on social media.

BTW bump stocks like used in Vegas shooting are still legal.
5171 2018-02-15 02:01:28 Prayers will not stop this. Legislation to outlaw the AR-15 and bump stocks and impose strict background checks and waiting periods will at least slow the killings.
5172 2018-02-15 02:01:05 I’m guessing bump stocks are kinda passé now
5173 2018-02-15 02:01:03 If you really cared U'd do something about the legality of AR-15's & Bump Stocks! They have no business on the streets of America. Military & Police a different story. The last several mass shootings, this firearm was used!!! Not needed to hunt, target practice or self defense!
5174 2018-02-15 02:01:01 How about background checks, bans on assault weapons, bump stocks and large magazines, eliminating the immunity from liability of gun manufacturers, criminalizing gun owners for not securing their guns, and not allowing concealed carry reciprocity?
5175 2018-02-15 02:00:58 I want to learn how to invest in stocks.
5176 2018-02-15 02:00:46 We will never have gun control--not bans on assault weapons or even  clips, not even regulations on bump stocks, or universal background  checks--as long as Rep. have the power to block it. Americans  need to vote them out of office and at least take a stand for our  children
5177 2018-02-15 02:00:37 U mean media stocks  will be under pressure bek of less attention?
5178 2018-02-15 02:00:24 GOP takes millions from the treasonous NRA Russian colluders.  They couldn't even talk about banning bumper stocks!
5179 2018-02-15 02:00:21 Ay bagong stocks si mommy mo
5180 2018-02-15 02:00:01 AR-15s are just as responsible for these dead kids as the gov't that allows them, the NRA & manufacturers that promote them, & the people who use them. Every time=AR-15. 
But when Congress can't even enact a ban on bump stocks then we will continue dying by truckloads #guncontrol
5181 2018-02-15 01:59:54 To do what? Buy more gun stocks? Donate to the NRA?
5182 2018-02-15 01:59:35 Yes, the same ones who love to brag about being “pro-LIFE” support all things related to life taking guns! Even bump-stocks are still legal. #VoteThemOut
5183 2018-02-15 01:59:24 "WTF is up with the #Dow, and why you shouldn't give a F" - Reasonable Risk is going on another deep dive this week.  #ignorethedow #StockMarket #stocks
5184 2018-02-15 01:59:04 @SpeakerRyan So, I’m taking your silence on this latest school shooting as your realization that Congress and YOU are failing us. YOU are failing our children. I notice bump stocks are still legal, I notice. DO YOUR DAMN JOB OR RESIGN.
5185 2018-02-15 01:59:00 You’re right. Something has changed. We went from muskets to AR-15s with bump stocks. Which would you rather face if you were one of 3000 kids running out of a high school.
5186 2018-02-15 01:58:57 ... subject, and that means rational gun owners.

People in the firearms hobby we're yelling about bump stocks for ages prior to Vegas, but the people pushing gun control had no idea bc they didn't know enough to know what they didn't know.
5187 2018-02-15 01:58:56 Maybe time for an article on what Maine DC reps are (mostly aren't) doing on guns? E.g: 

--Why did Susan Collins flipflop on the assault gun ban & gun clip limits?
--Why was King so misinformed about bump stocks in his explanation of his assault gun vote?

#mepolitics
5188 2018-02-15 01:58:56 Prayers won't stop this. Legislation to remove AR-15 , bump stocks and the like will at least slow this.
5189 2018-02-15 01:58:55 @RepSmucker As your constituent I DEMAND that you stand up to the NRA and put forth sensible gun control measures. Ban automatic weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines. Make it at least as hard to get a gun as it is to get a driver's license.

Get bent.

#RichLivesMatter
5192 2018-02-15 01:58:35 I'll take a your 1% improvement on the number of people killed by guns.  That's over 300 per year btw. And there are lots of ways around background checks. Bump stocks used once to kill over 50 ppl and wound over 500. You've got b.s. talking points, man.
5193 2018-02-15 01:58:07 Let me check a few gun company stocks. All up today! That’s all that matters! Today was a great day to be a gun maker. God Bless America
5194 2018-02-15 01:57:48 Possession of pot is illegal in lots of places. We could make possession of assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines illegal. With arrests and jail time for outlaws, like with pot. These weapons are more dangerous by far than pot. And more addictive.
5195 2018-02-15 01:57:42 The first meeting was a success!
Thank you to all those who were able to make it today!

Recap: We have split everyone who has attended into small groups. We will be running a group game next week which will help us analyze stocks together!

Ban Assault Weapons and bump stocks from the public!
Do something!
5198 2018-02-15 01:56:11 @SpeakerRyan will do nothing to remove the AR-15 from our streets. Just like he did nothing to remove bump stocks. He is bought and paid for by the NRA.
5199 2018-02-15 01:55:56 You mean the racist elf who needs bodies to fill up prisons so his stocks increase in value
5200 2018-02-15 01:55:51 What’s been done to stop sale of bump stocks? NOTHING
5201 2018-02-15 01:55:46 With deep respect, litigation doesn’t cut it. Lawmakers need to act. It won’t prevent every gun crime but it will save hundreds of thousands of lives - literally. Background checks. Bump stocks. Big ammo clips. Lots of bad laws to change.
5202 2018-02-15 01:55:29 Hey haters, what where you saying about #bitcoin #litecoin #ltc $LTC $BTC being dead???   LTC $106 to $227 in 2 weeks so far... soooooo.... hmmm. #haters #cryptocurrency #stocks #blockchain
5203 2018-02-15 01:55:11 I've broken stocks down via ROE, margins etc.....sometimes it correlates to charts and sometimes it I find it doesn't. You got more experience than me as I just got into the market a few years ago. Guess your experience favors techs over any particular fundamentals?
5204 2018-02-15 01:54:46 I apologize. You didn't sight automatic weapons or politics, so I was out of line. 

Are you referring to bump stocks? I know there are discussions happening to regulate them, but I haven't heard of any regulation has been passed yet
5205 2018-02-15 01:54:22 They wouldn't even ban gun stocks after Las Vegas!  They just let the topic die out & disappear, which was the PLAN.  Do nothing & eventually it's gone from news cycle.
5206 2018-02-15 01:54:19 That's true.  They didn't even ban bump stocks after Las Vegas.  And bump stocks are literally a DEADLY loophole in the fully automatic weapons' ban. #inners
5207 2018-02-15 01:54:19 What you're buying in SIP is more important. If the core stocks are terrible, say like tata steel, a commodity company, even after 10 years ur returns will be NIL!
5208 2018-02-15 01:54:11 You pray it never comes. And yet it does. Over and over. Maybe instead of praying, you do your actual job? Ban AR15s etc. Ban bump stocks. Drop the suppressor nonsense. Stricter background checks. Strict penalties for not securing your guns.
5209 2018-02-15 01:54:03 Ok, so this is Rubio's statement, but before I lose it on you Jeff, what's your position?  17 killed by a deranged kid using an AR15.  What more do you need to know before this discussion begins. We're still waiting for action on bump-stocks following Vegas shooting.
5210 2018-02-15 01:53:59 STILL waiting for legislation to ban bump stocks #guncontrol
5211 2018-02-15 01:53:58 Triumph updated stocks. 3 nalang jud. 
5212 2018-02-15 01:53:46 That includes voting for those pols who continually block common sense gun laws. The 2nd amendment was not meant to protect bump stocks or arm abusers.
5213 2018-02-15 01:53:39 Also legislation on high capacity magazines, bump stocks, eliminating gun show loophole. Having mandatory gun safety training for each type of firearm, waiting periods for gun purchases.
5214 2018-02-15 01:53:17 Gun violence is a national health and security catastrophe. Immigrants are not the problem with our national security. Unfettered access to weapons of all kind available to young people, no background checks at gun shows, no laws against bump stocks. #GunInsanity
5215 2018-02-15 01:53:07 [Touken Ranbu - Hanamaru] ...Wait they actually did loot Osaka castle and then played stocks with that?

:D
5216 2018-02-15 01:53:02 Totally concede that. We’re dealing with an epidemic. But, is there worth in trying to minimize mass casualty events like this or Las Vegas? As a society, can we not say this is intolerable, and we must act to stem near-monthly massacres? Bump stocks, extended clips, etc.

Jason: we got 8 AR-15s with bump stocks

*cluster bombs drop from 1970s A10 — rebellion ends*
5218 2018-02-15 01:52:34 If he had a six shooter or knive it would have been different. ARs have no place in civilian life. Look for compromises with NRA. Maybe more screening. Close loopholes. Ban Bump stocks, something.
5219 2018-02-15 01:52:30 #PrayforDouglas and then pass sensible gun legislation.  Bump stocks are still legal. Assault rifles aren't used for hunting or home defense. This is unacceptable.
5220 2018-02-15 01:52:25 She probably has gun stocks
5221 2018-02-15 01:52:19 terrible it was yes correct is your assessment th xperma but peeps still hiding in bonds because market irrespective of indices ppl lost lota money..if some money comes out bonds into stocks, then uptirck rates will help this decaying product ..pos it was
5222 2018-02-15 01:52:14 Updated stocks Wonder Bra wacoal good quality
5223 2018-02-15 01:51:52 I spend very little time on fundamentals...I believe most of the historical and projected fundamental data are already reflected in stock prices...pretty much all I do is check to see if my stocks are trading at a reasonable PEG ratio
5224 2018-02-15 01:51:46 The shooter in Las Vegas used a semi automatic weapon with a bump stock which allows a high rate of fire. I am in full support of bump stocks being banned. But this has nothing to do with today's events.
5225 2018-02-15 01:51:42 Couldn't even manage to do anything about bump stocks.
5226 2018-02-15 01:51:00 Good question. Obviously, outlawing assault weapons and bump stocks is a good start. Detailed background checks with a longer wait time is another. Not asking hunters to give up their guns.
5227 2018-02-15 01:50:54 European stocks rose on Wednesday, rebounding from early losses, as data showed a robust pace of economic growth in the euro zone and corporate earnings surprised on the upside.
5228 2018-02-15 01:50:51 no automatic weapons. stricter background checks. longer wait times. no bump stocks. only pistols if used for protection and rifles for hunting. single shots. different story for law enforcement of course.
5229 2018-02-15 01:50:46 #MSNBC Why do you never interview a CEO from a ammunition factory?  Maybe because the 1% that fund your news show have stocks in a gun company.
5230 2018-02-15 01:50:17 And so you fixed that by making it EASIER for him to get military weapons? No background checks? No mental health check? Bump stocks for everybody? You people are some sick puppies.
5231 2018-02-15 01:49:46 US stocks rose on Wednesday, shrugging off strong inflation data as investors focused on the solid economic growth outlook.
5232 2018-02-15 01:49:36 Stock market is a variable that runs up and down based on how the buyers and sellers feel about the processes going on.  Many of us sold our stocks when o a,a got elected, and never got back into that shaky business.
5233 2018-02-15 01:49:30 I understand and would love to discuss. I would love for u to have your pistol and hunting rifle but assault weapons, large magazines, bump stocks, why do u need those? Time for #commonsenseregulations
5234 2018-02-15 01:49:25 And long rifle is easier to snatch out of perps hands, and doesn’t have a flash suppressor to hide shooting position, aren’t generally modular/easily modified to bump stocks or other fully auto methods etc...
5235 2018-02-15 01:49:21 Sorry...Litecoin for the win, definitely!
5236 2018-02-15 01:49:16 checked my lil stocks and they were green today...always a good day.....
5237 2018-02-15 01:49:04 you already have to have a background check, magazine size has zero effect on a weapons effectiveness, bump stocks have been used exactly once and AP rounds have never been used in  a shooting. nothing you listed would have had any effect on 99 percent of shootings.
5238 2018-02-15 01:48:51 you have no use for a semi automatic rifle, bump stocks, or thousands of rounds of ammo. Unless you’re an actual licensed hunter. Doesn’t mean all guns are banned
5239 2018-02-15 01:48:28 Thoughts and prayers are meaningless at this point. You take $ from the NRA and have done ZERO to protect all those dead. You're an accomplice to murder sir. Bump stocks & gat cranks, still legal. Maybe if someone u love is killed you'll actually do something. Words are cheap
5240 2018-02-15 01:48:15 Which asset do you mean?  Stocks...
5241 2018-02-15 01:48:06 Bitcoin for the win!
5242 2018-02-15 01:48:03 $SRNE, just made it onto Muscle Stocks, ST Trend, as you noted is up, Buy signal and strength rating of 93.
5243 2018-02-15 01:48:01 Thank you for your like on the #stocks of the day @Stockhunteress $BUFF broke out of a flat base and hit a new high on Wednesday. Have a great day.
5244 2018-02-15 01:47:53 Yeah, leading up to the GFC I remember a mob that had a covered call strategy that reported 100% closed winners, meanwhile a few of the underlying stocks were down more than 90%
5245 2018-02-15 01:47:34 Understood.  How about an "A" from common sense approach:  sensible gun control, magazine limits, banned bump stocks, freedom for communities to choose, etc.  Either way, they have defined the narrative.  It's time to stop cowering in fear of these greedy enablers!
5246 2018-02-15 01:47:29 That looks similar to the weapon envisioned by the crafters of the 2A. Not military grade machine guns, bump stocks for civilians.
5247 2018-02-15 01:47:14 cansol ang mining rig kay di ko sugtan. paano magbakal stocks sang applen or amazon? 
5248 2018-02-15 01:47:11 10Y UST 2.93... going for 3%... Stocks going up. 
5249 2018-02-15 01:47:06 The founding fathers didn't have bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons. They had muskets and muzzleloaders.
5250 2018-02-15 01:46:38 Caught with gun lying around jail, 25 k fine, child accidentally shoots the gun, jail and 25k fine, loss of gun rights, no bump stocks, no assault weapons! Stricter in everyway, the NRA and gun owners have not succeeded in creating a healthy gun culture. Their failure is deadly.
5251 2018-02-15 01:46:29 This might make a play for drug stocks as Buffett buys $TEVA
5252 2018-02-15 01:46:16 And the manufacturer stocks will spike tomorrow.
5253 2018-02-15 01:45:43 Love $csco. Held position from past 3 months and I was introduced into it because of my favourite @petenajarian , @permabear_uk . Love it . Thank you @petenajarian @permabear_uk
5254 2018-02-15 01:45:34 The Least they can do is ban assualt rifles and boom-stocks. But, Trump is deregulating gun laws.  They won’t even keep the mental health background checks it’s disgraceful.  “Thoughts  and Prayers” hasn’t stopped this and won’t stop it from happening. #GunControlNow
5255 2018-02-15 01:45:32 Thanks for the RT and like the top 15 EPS Q/Q #Stocks @fitnessbs $BUFF was our stock of the day and hit a new high on Wednesday. Have an awesome day.
5256 2018-02-15 01:45:20 When your in a movie theater or a concert like the one in Nevada in which 59 were killed and 515 were injured and the shooter is 1,000s of ft away with a high powered scope and bump stocks there's not much you can do. They wouldn't even outlaw bump stocks.
5257 2018-02-15 01:45:15 Enough is enough.  Mandatory background checks, no bump stocks and less access to AK style weapons.  Children should never have to be around this. No one should.
5258 2018-02-15 01:45:02 Here's a question: is there any reason anyone other than military or law enforcement would need automatic weapons & bump stocks? Also, forbid the NRA from making political contributions. Things would change FAST.
5259 2018-02-15 01:44:44 For a short time bump stocks were not being sold voluntary after Las Vegas
5260 2018-02-15 01:44:33 昼夜完全に逆転してるからちょっとヤバさを感じてる
5261 2018-02-15 01:44:03 i faced the issue on Sunday - can I send you the recipt? You can see that it was successfull checking but it did not let me swipe the card?
5262 2018-02-15 01:43:55 So the Republican Senate Majority Leader and Speaker of the House refused to even debate any limits on bump stocks because some Senators and Reps said they should?  Talk about snowflakes, huh.
5263 2018-02-15 01:43:50 We couldn't even change the law on bump stocks after Vegas where 58 people died.
5264 2018-02-15 01:43:48 Thanks for the information! I use Merill Lynch now but they have so many restrictions on certain stocks the room plays so I need to change.
5265 2018-02-15 01:43:30 I just read about bump stocks on Twitter actually not silencers and interstate carry
5266 2018-02-15 01:43:20 Sadly too late - there are more guns than people in the US. Any effective gun control methods (banning AR 15s, bump stocks, large magazines) will take years if not decades to affect mass shootings. The best solution is to make the NRA and  cult of gun ownership socially taboo.
5267 2018-02-15 01:43:08 The Founding Father’s legislated muskets not assault riffles with bump stocks and large magazines. To be true to the Founders pick your musket folks.
5268 2018-02-15 01:42:46 You did nothing since Vegas.  You are filled with empty promises and bs.  Spare us the prayers.  Bump stocks are still legal in the US, and you have done NOTHING!
5269 2018-02-15 01:42:43 1. Mental health care.
2. Background check—every gun, everytime, everywhere (they make this thing called a computer with these programs .)
3. No bump stocks.
4. Limit magazines.
5. Fund a “relinquish a gun for reward” program.
6. Mandatory gun safety class to own a gun.
5270 2018-02-15 01:42:17 Sadly too late - there are more guns than people in the US. Any effective gun control methods (banning AR 15s, bump stocks, large magazines) will take years if not decades to affect mass shootings. The best solution is to make the NRA and  cult of gun ownership socially taboo.
5271 2018-02-15 01:42:03 It's similar to not being able to buy stocks with a credit card.
5272 2018-02-15 01:41:52 Ted.. doubling down on what? 2 x o is zero! Do something you slugs!!!! Ban ar15 and bump stocks...
5273 2018-02-15 01:41:48 Glad you liked the top 5 EPS #Stocks @igetdailymoney $IPG with a new high on Wednesday. Have an outstanding day.
5274 2018-02-15 01:41:35 How many more must die for you to realize the fault in your own constitution.......bump stocks are legal what next...legalization of mental health patients to own firearms....oh wait..... whoops.
5275 2018-02-15 01:41:29 When you put bump stocks on them and fire off multiple magazines in a matter of seconds I would say that classifies as an assault rifle
5276 2018-02-15 01:41:02 Sadly too late - there are more guns than people in the US. Any effective gun control methods (banning AR 15s, bump stocks, large magazines) will take years if not decades to affect mass shootings. The best solution is to make the NRA and  cult of gun ownership socially taboo.
5277 2018-02-15 01:40:44 I just said bump stocks why you ignoring that? That makes it an automatic weapon due to it's firing rate goodness you are slow
5278 2018-02-15 01:40:38 Who cares???? He is wrong more often then he is right .... stick to teaching the fundamentals of investing and stop picking stocks...
5279 2018-02-15 01:39:59 It was nice of you to like the top 5 EPS #stocks @LossRemedy $TLND had a nice day on Wednesday up 10%. Have a wonderful day.
5280 2018-02-15 01:39:57 In the 1930’s before NRA mobsters were using the Tommy gun to kill people. Congress banned tommy guns problem was solved, nowhere around the world has this problem. Clips having over 20rds, why? Bump stocks, why? Automatic weapons, why? No  universal background checks, why?
5281 2018-02-15 01:39:51 Who's to judge what can shoot lots of people quickly? I can shoot some of my bolt actions as fast as some people can shoot automatics. I'm all for attacking the problem be it bump stocks, hi cap mags, and/or mental health
5282 2018-02-15 01:39:45 More laws/restrictions. More stringent background checks. Bans on bump stocks. Closing the gunshow loophole. There’s plenty we can do.
5283 2018-02-15 01:39:33 Bump stocks yes. They need banned. 

Assault rifle though....define one
5284 2018-02-15 01:39:20 Remember when Congress post LV said, "I hear you. Bump stocks need to be dealt with. Right. Gotcha. So you're saying let's make suppressors easier to obtain! Copy. That." That's literally how we wrote gun laws.
5285 2018-02-15 01:39:14 生物とccbiしか最終レポまで楽しかった講義ないなぁ今のところ
5286 2018-02-15 01:39:12 we JUST had the Vegas shooter kill all those people using bump stocks and we still haven’t had one bill preventing that. The NRA crowd are most a bunch of sheep
5287 2018-02-15 01:39:03 Thoughts and prayers...  bullets and bump stocks.  You're a murderer Joni.  Straight up... you have blood on your hands
5288 2018-02-15 01:38:42 Depends on what you mean by "effect." I mean universal background checks, limiting magazine capacities, outlawing bump stocks and armor piercing bullets ( all per the Constitution's "well-regulated" condition). If that's too much of an effect for you then we'll agree to disagree.
5289 2018-02-15 01:38:39 @SenJoniErnst DO SOMETHING!!! Frankly your thoughts and prayers are disgusting me. Implement gun control policy — bump stocks, background checks, no automatic weapons, limit number of magazines!!!!!!
5290 2018-02-15 01:38:38 I think you think we are stupid. Whether it is 1, 3, 6 or more... it’s too many. Look at Vegas, what’s happened with bump stocks ... nada. It’s always nada. I don’t blame the media I blame the nra and the politicians who would rather have their $
5291 2018-02-15 01:38:34 Get rid of bump stocks, mandatory waiting periods for all states, background checks. I realize none of these measures is going to stop the illegal purchase of guns but most of these mass shootings have been legal purchases. Mandatory gun safety courses if you have a license.
5292 2018-02-15 01:38:07 Personal experience advice: Don't get a VUL. Get a health insurance instead then invest in MF/UITF or stocks.  Gut feel lang to, walang actuarial advice hahahaha
5293 2018-02-15 01:38:07 I mean I’m just saying: if the NRA position held water, how many more guns before we get to peace? Two guns for every man, woman, and child? Two semi-automatics with bump stocks? Because we’ve been assured that the way to be safe is more guns. Just give me a number.
5294 2018-02-15 01:37:10 They're still military style weapons with modified rates of fire & custom stocks & shit to look cooler. Folk always argue they aren't assault or military weapons.
5295 2018-02-15 01:37:02 I started investing, last week I was down 22 cents and today I’m up 5 cents stocks are crazy y’all
5296 2018-02-15 01:36:47 Thanks for the RT on the top 5 EPS #Stocks @VladislavT10 $CARB was up 22% on Wednesday not bad. Have a super day.
5297 2018-02-15 01:36:16 So do you believe the NRA doesn’t lobby to keep laws from being passed that ban certain firearms? Jesus.... we can’t even get bump stocks banned.  Why in the hell does anyone need bump stocks?? But they don’t get banned because the NRA has the sorry ass Congress in their pockets.
5298 2018-02-15 01:36:07 Get the NRA out of our government!
Ban Assault Weapons and bump stocks now!
5299 2018-02-15 01:35:38 Bump stocks & silencers & interstate carry. Hell, no.
5300 2018-02-15 01:35:35 Payed $15 at Xeno to take two stocks off Dabuz Bayo and then lose to Lylat in losers. 

Keep forgetting NYC is addicted to Lylat when they get 2 stocked game 1.
5301 2018-02-15 01:35:07 Ban bump stocks.  Ban AR-15s.  Ban gun possession under age 21.
5302 2018-02-15 01:35:01 Bought a house bought weed stocks sold it all in profit for #cryptocurrency  go big or go home?
5303 2018-02-15 01:34:56 So what was the manipulation? After figures it goes usually the "wrong" way..  market realizes that it can't go much further and turns around violently..
We had a VIX short squeeze..  that is over now and stocks on way to making new highs..
5304 2018-02-15 01:34:46 Bumper stocks, and background checks to weed out those dangerous to society.  Minimal but time for Republicans to be responsible. God
5305 2018-02-15 01:34:14 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.(No.131) #Duo30L11
5306 2018-02-15 01:33:58 You do t think restrictions on type of weapon would make a difference? Bump stocks. Assault rifles, etc.? I think it’s a valid (though annoying) argument that when the the right to bear arms was included, guns were single shot weapons.
5307 2018-02-15 01:33:55 "Thoughts and prayers" do JACK SHIT. You know what WOULD do something?
BANNING ASSAULT WEAPONS SND BUMP STOCKS.
STRICTER BACKGROUND CHECKS, NO GUNS FOR DOMESTIC ABUSERS.
NO OWNING A GUN WITHOUT A LISCENSE, MANDATORY TRAINING AND SAFETY COURSES BEFORE YOU GET YOUR LISCENSE.
5308 2018-02-15 01:33:53 Hey @PRyan, how's that work on bump stocks going?  You've had time to learn about them.  NRA got your tongue?
5309 2018-02-15 01:33:48 2/2 own or possess guns. Require more safety features on guns such as smart guns. Fund the CDC and enable them to study gun violence. End immunity for gun manufacturers. Ban bump stocks. Create a federal database to track gun sales.
5310 2018-02-15 01:33:22 We put a g-d man on the moon. Surely, we can eliminate AR-15’s and bump stocks. Nothing short of our own souls is at stake. #ProtectOurKids #EndGunViolence
5311 2018-02-15 01:33:19 I made 15$ off my stocks this week 
5312 2018-02-15 01:33:13 For starters:
- Close the gun show loophole.
- Prohibit anyone with a domestic violence charge/conviction and/or DV restraining order against them from accessing weapons. (Huge connection be DV & mass shooters)
- 72 hour waiting period for gun purchases.
- Ban AR-15 & bump stocks
5313 2018-02-15 01:33:09 Auto is already illegal. Ok with getting rid of Bump stocks but they make the gun less accurate so it's possible that would make it worse. Mental health is the problem but not for guns only. When people are talking about killing people they shouldn't be allowed to be in public.
5314 2018-02-15 01:32:50 Gee.  I remember recent legislation to ban bump stocks and guns popularly used in mass shootings and the Republicans voting it down.
5315 2018-02-15 01:32:48 生物の単位を獲得して今日はおしまい
5316 2018-02-15 01:32:40 Sometimes I ask myself if VUL is worth it. hahaha I'm in my 4th policy year, and I have paid twice the amount of my current surrender value !?! Should I just have gotten a life insurance and invested the premium difference in stocks or MF?
5317 2018-02-15 01:32:29 Who’s ideology is killing kids with AR-15s? Or, at least enabling it? An ideology that won’t even ban bump stocks is f’d
5318 2018-02-15 01:32:15 No one needs these types of guns! Nor do they need bump stocks!
5319 2018-02-15 01:31:56 i mean if I needed to really defend myself from say a gang, I'd need a helluva lot more than a few AR-15's even with bumper stocks
5320 2018-02-15 01:31:52 I live in Pennsylvania. Do something. Tell all your political friends do something. 
Background checks..get rid of bump stocks .. get rid of AR 15’s... take guns away from anyone guilty of violence against any person...  get rid of magazines full of death
5321 2018-02-15 01:31:48 AR 15 campur bump stocks tu deadly. amarika amarika
5322 2018-02-15 01:31:31 What’s your plan to ban assault rifles, bump stocks, etc!  Forget building The Wall!  We have a much bigger issue!
5323 2018-02-15 01:31:30 I’ve literally never touched a gun in my life but I know so, so many people with modified AR-15s with bump stocks. That’s America.
5324 2018-02-15 01:30:56 Talks of #Apple doing a large stock repurchase. Could mean good things for future dividend growth! #investments $AAPL #portfolio #markets #stocks #infotech
5325 2018-02-15 01:30:17 I'm not hearing any "solutions" coming from your side of the aisle. The truth is, gun stocks are going to go up tomorrow morning and the NRA is going to make a ton of money off of this, just like they always do. Making money off of dead kids.
5326 2018-02-15 01:30:09 I feel sorry for your child who will grow up learning your hate and lack of critical thinking. Children were murdered in Florida today. Bump stocks are still legal.  Massive magazines are still legal. Assault rifles are still legal. Come on man.  This isn't about the DNC.
5327 2018-02-15 01:30:09 6. Bump stocks or any modification to increase the rate of fire more than one shot per one full pull of the trigger is punishable by jail time.
5328 2018-02-15 01:29:55 And there is no reason to think the trend is going to magically stop (finally) in response to “thoughts and prayers.” It is going to take making assault weapons illegal, and requiring them to be turned in. Possession is illegal, bump stocks as well. Clean them up. NOW!
5329 2018-02-15 01:29:35 Ask A Trader starts is 30 minutes!!!  See you there! We have a lot to cover tonight!! #stocks #daytrading #trader #profits #JLewisTrading
5330 2018-02-15 01:29:28 @SpeakerRyan Sir, how many more people must be shot dead before you allow Congress to act for our safety? Vote down the concealed carry bill. Implement blanket background checks. Stop bump stocks. Fund mental health initiatives. Turn off the NRA cash spigot. Voters are watching.
5331 2018-02-15 01:28:29 Figure out a way to motivate people who want to ban semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, etc, and institute rigorous background checks. When the overwhelming majority of ppl who want these things to call/email/visit/harass legislators like gun rights ppl do, we will win.
5332 2018-02-15 01:28:07 gold is hard earned money, stocks are fast and loose like nate hooker and his vape pen. super dank Colorado green oil is worth ... 30 times drilled oil.  Do you see a slight paradigm shift in 2018? Weed is predicted to be 18 times market bigger than cigarettes. and sustainable
5333 2018-02-15 01:27:56 Remember Vegas? Remember the consensus on bump stocks? What has congress done? Nothing.
5334 2018-02-15 01:27:42 1) Ban assault weapons, bumper stocks, and anything that is not reasonably used for defense and hunting (I know the deer run fast, but c’mon)

2) Train, test, and license gun owners, like we do with driver’s licenses (1/4)

#GunControlNow
5335 2018-02-15 01:27:33 #GunControlNow Remember when a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers said they would ban bump stocks after Las Vegas and fix the instant background check system after Texas? Neither happened.
5336 2018-02-15 01:27:25 Thoughts and prayers to the victims and families of the Florida  school shooting.  After Vegas our reps said it was too soon to talk about revising gun laws.  I am a HUGE proponent of the 2nd Amendment! It's time to talk about gun law revision.  Bump stocks? AR-15? Come on man!!
5337 2018-02-15 01:27:15 Completely agree that banning bump stocks is a no brainer. Although my understanding is that  even if they are banned they can be installed manually very easily. So worth doing, although may not prevent much.
5338 2018-02-15 01:27:04 Trump giving away money. Buy stocks
5339 2018-02-15 01:26:58 @RepTomReed @JoeNBC This is not about gun control....it can't be!!! 17 dead...it is about civility!! It is about simple common sense!! AR 15, Bump stocks, Automatic wepons serve no civilized purpose. Students, Teachers, Administrators and staff are dying! Enough is Enough.
5340 2018-02-15 01:26:46 There are enough of these there vs the rest of the world that one more shouldn’t require any great additional thought.  For Christ sake we still haven’t banned bump stocks.
5341 2018-02-15 01:26:10 Why don't you do something about  bump stocks instead of your phony prayers. You don't care about anyone but yourself.
5342 2018-02-15 01:25:57 Missed the bus on #LTC #Litecoin but... I am liking #NEO and #XRP let's see if I can catch me a couple #WAVES #SurfsUP #Crypto #BTC #Bitcoin #Cryptocurrency #Binance #Money #Stocks #Winning
5343 2018-02-15 01:25:55 Really Einstein? Designed and executed to maximize loss of life.. that’s the American way isn’t ? AR15’s high capacity mags and bump stocks. Maximize it all, courtesy of the NRA and politicians like yourself.
5344 2018-02-15 01:25:43 About half of Americans own stocks, but the data I used shows how concentrated total ownership is. Someone with $5M benefits a lot more than someone with $5K.
5345 2018-02-15 01:25:37 Remember after the Vegas shooting how the NRA and our political leaders were going to do something about ' bump stocks'
#sad
5346 2018-02-15 01:25:33 Battlefield. No items. 4 stocks.
5347 2018-02-15 01:25:30 What does this mean exactly, Potus and Pence?
You are working closely on what? Other than spout meaningless platidudes have you actually done ANYTHING to stop this carnage? Have you worked on enacting reasonable gun laws? You couldn’t even manage to ban bump stocks.
Shame on you
5348 2018-02-15 01:25:30 @savestacks @ViciousTrading I see some divergence in weed stocks from spy. Worrying. What are you guys seeing?
5349 2018-02-15 01:25:25 wag ka magtrade ng ibang stocks ha hahahaha
5350 2018-02-15 01:25:14 There was a time in the 30s & 40s when Tommy guns, automatic weapons were used. U.S. outlawed them and automatic weapons death decreased dramatically. Now semi-automatic weapons can be made to be automatic easily. Bump stocks available. Make it available, it will be used.
5351 2018-02-15 01:25:14 We don't want to blame a gun, we want control over over how they are sold. Not make it more efficient to buy a gun however, where ever and whenever you want. We couldn't even get them to go against bump stocks. yes people will find a way, but do we need to make it so damn easy?
5352 2018-02-15 01:25:13 You preconceived notions are limited to those around you.

You surround yourself with ...

I know a kid who graduated HS, applied for scholarships and loans, and received both. Put loans in stocks to earn money.

Also had an AmEx before his first day in college, in his name.
5353 2018-02-15 01:25:00 Bump stocks are still legal. Time for you to get after @SpeakerRyan or take back the House!
5354 2018-02-15 01:24:31 we need to show this so people will be horrified enough to act. i am horrified and heartbroken. The Republicans need to be voted out of office so we can finally get some common sense gun control. Ban AR-15's & Bump Stocks for a start.
5355 2018-02-15 01:24:27 You missed my point;  Chicago is used to prove gun laws don’t work. If every state banned assault/semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, & magazines, & bought back the ones already out there, gun violence would go down— even in Chicago. Guns are 3rd leading cause of death for kids.
5356 2018-02-15 01:23:57 Friendly reminder that we didn’t even ban BUMP STOCKS after Las Vegas. Congress won’t change things. You will. Vote in your primaries. Vote in the midterms. Make sure you’re registered and VOTE in people who will do something other than offer thoughts and prayers.
5357 2018-02-15 01:23:46 My point is that mass shooters aren’t aiming. They are spraying their shots. Bump stocks made the Vegas shooter very effective.
5358 2018-02-15 01:23:40 How do guns not permit mass murder? I mean seriously? We have extra clips, bump stocks- things that allow you to kill more people. Not to hunt. To kill people. Guns are the problem. Mental health is the second.
5359 2018-02-15 01:23:25 The last 5 biggest mass shootings were done with AR 15s. With bump stocks they become automatic.
5360 2018-02-15 01:23:23 At this Rate Immigration will B a Non Starter! Who wants 2 Bring their Families 2 a Country THAT WON'T PROTECT ITS OWN! BUMP STOCKS Couldn't even Get Banished Under this Useless Gov't! Screw the 2nd Amendment! It's that ANTIQUATED Idea + the NRA OWN'G POLITICIANS THAT KILLS!
5361 2018-02-15 01:22:52 @SenateGOP @SenateDems @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats Is it time for gun control yet?? Why are bump stocks still legal and why can people on a terrorist watch list buy guns? @CNN #GunControlNow #Midterms2018 #BlueWaveIsComing
5362 2018-02-15 01:22:40 Sad about the horrible Florida shooting and tomorrow guns sales and stocks will go up.  Where is the Government when people needs protection.
5363 2018-02-15 01:22:38 you honestly believe that the Founding Fathers meant AK37's, AR15's,  bump stocks, armor piercing bullets, silencers, when they wrote the 2nd  Amendment? might as well add small yield atomic weapons--these are  "ARMS" too arent they?  IGNORANCE!
5364 2018-02-15 01:22:35 Yes. The militia I’m forming needs bump stocks and high magazine capacity — Thomas Paine probably
5365 2018-02-15 01:22:23 Prayers mean nothing if your NOT willing to do anything about it! Oh yeah Scalice, Las Vegas & now…STILL NO MOVEMENT ON BUMP STOCKS??? You are all pitiful because the NRA is more important than human lives! DISGUSTING
5366 2018-02-15 01:22:08 Exactly.... I get you hate trump but this isn’t his fault or anything he can fix -  I still can’t believe the Vegas shooting and fucking bump stocks and huge magazines that hold 300 rounds are legal- makes me sick
5367 2018-02-15 01:22:03 you honestly believe that the Founding Fathers meant AK37's, AR15's, bump stocks, armor piercing bullets, silencers, when they wrote the 2nd Amendment? might as well add small yield atomic weapons--these are "ARMS" too arent they?  IGNORANCE!
5368 2018-02-15 01:21:43 Florida today, here at home in Pa. another day. Take the lead. Stand up against gun violence. Implement blanket background checks. Stop bump stocks. Fund mental health initiatives. Turn off the NRA cash spigot. Work the system for our safety, for our kids. Voters are watching.
5369 2018-02-15 01:21:15 It's doing worse than my natural gas stocks in the Montney...thanks @JustinTrudeau won't be putting any more money into Canada your regs are killing investment
5370 2018-02-15 01:21:13 Time to ban semi-auto weapons and bump stocks and , require background checks
5371 2018-02-15 01:21:05 I'm liberal and was fine with the 2A but the gun lobby won't even let us ban bump stocks. It's just crazy.
5372 2018-02-15 01:20:45 No doubt that Vegas was used to bring bump stocks to the Forefront.
5373 2018-02-15 01:20:24 Only the military or specialized FBI/police.  Remember, only the good guys follow the laws.  And now that they are so prevalent?  Limit ammo sales.  Register all of them.  No bump stocks.  No full auto.  Fed crime to not have it registered.  Follow our own damn laws!!!
5374 2018-02-15 01:20:20 How about we DO have more laws. Like making AR-15's illegal? Or making bump-stocks illegal? Or putting parents in jail if a child kills another child or themselves?
5375 2018-02-15 01:20:17 100% agree. Though it's insane to me that bump stocks, for example, still haven't been outlawed because 1) it's a very specific proposal, 2) it would have prevented the Las Vegas tragedy, and 3) I have yet to hear a single good argument against it
5376 2018-02-15 01:20:05 Oh yeah Scalice, Las Vegas & now…STILL NO MOVEMENT ON BUMP STOCKS??? You are all pitiful because the NRA is more important than human lives! DISGUSTING
5377 2018-02-15 01:19:52 Stronger background checks, no high capacity magazines, no bump stocks, and as fun as shooting an AR can be, I don’t really think anyone needs one.
5378 2018-02-15 01:19:42 I didn't watch the vid because it had no sound. My take is that right aftre the tax giveaway took off in Feb. Companies created this selloff to buy back their own stocks to drive up the price. You can tell me I am wrong about it, but it looks bad.
5379 2018-02-15 01:19:38 What other countries do: reasonable gun control. Background checks that work, no AR 15s, no high capacity magazines, no bump stocks.
5380 2018-02-15 01:19:20 i've fired a gun but don't know anything about bump stocks beyodn what I've wathced on youtube videos. 

Then make guns unable to be fired so quickly for civilian use. Hunters don't need to kill masses of animals.
5381 2018-02-15 01:19:20 focusing on trading $NOW for today. Not trading other stocks regardless of what outcome
5382 2018-02-15 01:19:15 I told Bruce after we went to break I have no problem with banning bump stocks but just think it’s ineffective. In a few years 3D printing will become common enough to invalidate 90% of gun laws
5383 2018-02-15 01:19:13 You are a fraud. Return NRA $. Work toward gun laws that the majority of Americans support. Ban assault weapons, bump stocks  stronger licensing requirements close loopholes. I don’t want your thoughts or prayers I want your courage and integrity
5384 2018-02-15 01:18:48 Florida today, here at home in Pa. another day. When you finish your prayers, stand up against gun violence. Implement blanket background checks. Stop bump stocks. Fund mental health initiatives. Turn off the NRA cash spigot. Your voters are watching.
5385 2018-02-15 01:18:36 Eugene failed A S C E N D E D the cocky stocks .   
5386 2018-02-15 01:18:35 How about by banning all sales of semi-automatics and bump stocks. A small, measurable and not unreasonable step to get started.
5387 2018-02-15 01:18:28 Give back customs and then give more stocks so the crazy deaths aren’t so bad
5388 2018-02-15 01:18:25 No we fucking don't we have sitiatuon where people are going ape shit with bump stocks & automatic weapons & then the police or some other gov agency is stoppig them not citizens that's 1/10 situation
5389 2018-02-15 01:18:18 What type of legislation do you propose? Bump stocks are still legal after 500 people shot in Law Vegas. I await your reply!
5390 2018-02-15 01:17:22 Ban AR-15s.
Thorough background checks.
Close the gun show loophole.
Ban high capacity magazines.
Ban bump stocks.

#guncontrol
5391 2018-02-15 01:16:59 Wolf blitzed was happy to push for gun control @CNNPolitics . The guest was fake crying and talking about bump stocks . F U @CNNPolitics
5392 2018-02-15 01:16:58 @andersoncooper We'll discuss the Florida shooting, the right and left will give their position on guns and gun safety, "good guy with a gun", etc. and we will repeat this cycle forever. Bump stocks are back on the market. SO???
5393 2018-02-15 01:16:56 What pisses me off is how the GOP can act all high mighty and pass laws to ban abortion crying sanctity of life. Yet the GOP won't lift a finger to ban AR-15 or bump stocks which take lives.
5394 2018-02-15 01:16:47 @realDonaldTrump do something about gun control. No bump stocks. Background checks for all sales. Waiting periods to buy. Limit to mmagazines. That’s a start!!!!!
5395 2018-02-15 01:16:39 Agree about bump stocks, but you can make a bump stock with a pants belt.  Automatic weapons are illegal.  You do know that the AR in AR-15 doesn’t stand for assault rifle, right?
5396 2018-02-15 01:16:35 Stop selling assault rifles to citizens!  Stop selling bump stocks to citizens! Also,In Vegas the police had issues trying to identify shooter after all the 'good guys' got their guns out too. Who are the good guys?  What does it take to make a good guy snap?
5397 2018-02-15 01:16:04 Remember when a group of Republican lawmakers joined Democrats saying they'd ban bump stocks after Vegas and fix our broken instant background check system after Texas? Neither happened. And not one American should be surprised by this.  #Parkland #ParklandShooting #gunviolence
5398 2018-02-15 01:15:57 AXA ata siya. Di ka naman hahawak ng stocks. Yung company na mismo gagawa nun for you so ayun hahaha parang tutubo yung pera mo depending kung magaling yung AXA

5400 2018-02-15 01:15:47 If you ever fired a gun and know anything about bump stocks then you would know that anyone could create the same effect with just your finger.

5402 2018-02-15 01:15:32 It's just like people who sell their stocks or shift too more conservative investments after a huge market correction. Illogical panic.
5403 2018-02-15 01:15:28 Florida today, here at home in Pa. another day. When you finish your prayers, stand up against gun violence. Implement blanket background checks. Stop bump stocks. Fund mental health initiatives. Turn off the NRA cash spigot. Your voters are watching.
5404 2018-02-15 01:15:27 Shame on YOU!  How DARE you!! You must be some kinda crazy nutcase. Our kids are safe in Australia are SAFE BECAUSE we have gun control.  You yanks are the laughing stocks of the world and too dumb to realise it.
5405 2018-02-15 01:15:03 Wow. Very moving. Philip Mudd is right. I cried too. How can one disagree with him? It is INSANE we talk about "bump stocks" and bullsh*t like that when Children of God and kids of this nation are dying, frequently, due to our stupid gun laws. Bless the children. #PhilipMudd
5406 2018-02-15 01:14:58 2nd Ammendment rights aside, I think we can all agree that the number of casualties in these mass shootings would be SIGNIFICANTLY lower if the guns used were not AR-15 assault rifles, in some cases altered to be semi-automatic with bump stocks. This isn’t rocket science.
5407 2018-02-15 01:14:34 @Rob_Hoffman have you learned anything yet? Automatic Weapons are illegal. If they've been upgraded they are illegal. Bump Stocks are now illegal, People like you spreading bullshit should be illegal.  #JustSaying
5408 2018-02-15 01:14:32 今日は強いね。よいことだ！
5409 2018-02-15 01:13:58 If they can’t get rid of “bump stocks” after they were blamed in the Vegas shooting, the AR-15 used today isn’t going anywhere.
5410 2018-02-15 01:13:22 Do you think the 19-yr-old kid shooter has a gun problem? 1) ban the NRA from political campaign donation & from lobbying, 2) ban bump-stocks, auto & semi-automatic weapons, limit mags purchased, 3) mandate gun safety classes, 4) Give vics rights to sue #NRA/minor perp’s parents.
5411 2018-02-15 01:12:31 all last year Smith & Wesson (gun makers) stocks rose right after EVERY mass shooting
5412 2018-02-15 01:12:20 Bump stocks, anyone? Still for sale.
5413 2018-02-15 01:12:17 Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway Reveal Top Stocks For 2018
5414 2018-02-15 01:12:06 That argument isn't valid anymore.  You can add a bump stock that is completely legal and gain a rof comparable to any fully auto.  Accuracy at distance? none.  Sweeping in close quarters it is lethal.  Congress wont even ban bump stocks.
5415 2018-02-15 01:12:02 1)Ban assault weapons, bumper stocks, and anything that is not reasonably used for defense and hunting (I know the deer run fast, but c’mon)

2)Train, test, and license gun owners, like we do with driver’s licenses
5416 2018-02-15 01:11:53 This is not what they meant when the 2nd amendment was written. Stop being so terrified that liberals want your guns. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Make training mandatory before gun purchases.
5417 2018-02-15 01:11:40 I’m a proud owner of more than one gun, and do not blame the guns for mass shootings. But I advocate for #SensibleGunLaws and would not feel my gun ownership would be threatened by them: background checks, safety training w/test, criminal/ mental health checks, no bump stocks.
5418 2018-02-15 01:11:32 How's that ban on bump stocks going?
5419 2018-02-15 01:11:31 Is it still not time to talk about outlawing bump stocks?  Been waiting on the “appropriate time” for that one too.
5420 2018-02-15 01:11:24 Congress voted  to allow the mentally disabled to own guns. They refused to vote to forbid those on a no-fly watch list to buy guns. They won't  allow the government to keep an annual list of gun deaths in our country. No ban on bump stocks. Why?  NRZA
5421 2018-02-15 01:10:36 BULLSHIT

All you offer is #FakeOutrage and #EmptyPromises

Here in Las Vegas we are still waiting for action on BUMP STOCKS. Remeber that?

Midterms are coming tho in 265 days.

We won't forget you did nothing while our kids, family, and friends were gunned down.

#VoteThemOut
5422 2018-02-15 01:10:03 After Las Vegas instead of banning bump stocks we get H.R. 38 loosening gun laws. And the repub's in the senate try for it. After the NRA bribes you now what will you try to pass?
5423 2018-02-15 01:10:02 Exactly. You know after the last major shooting we had Congress was going to jump all over banning bump stocks. We see how that played out.
5424 2018-02-15 01:09:35 Gun Control Proponents: Ban AR-15’s. Universal Background Checks. Ban Bump Stocks. Federal licensing for gun owners. Limit Magazine capacity.
5425 2018-02-15 01:09:07 Don't you think it should be harder for our mentally ill citizens to get hold of guns and large stocks of ammo?
5426 2018-02-15 01:09:06 All I want to know is - are my gold stocks OK?  :)
5427 2018-02-15 01:08:39 You do know Bump Stocks were invented from the shooting technique of letting the recoil of the long gun bounce off your shoulder. It is very inaccurate way to fire.
5428 2018-02-15 01:08:18 DO YOUR JOB! Where's the ban on bump stocks that Congress talked about? BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS NOW! If you cannot resign from congress! @SpeakerRyan
5429 2018-02-15 01:08:11 I’m just saying that buying stocks for market value and making 8% is a hard way to go.
5430 2018-02-15 01:08:10 Hey @RogueCPI!
It's not true that nothing has been tried.

The kind & caring people at the NRA make it easier than ever to buy guns that are perfect for slaughtering innocents.

The GOP & NRA have helped by making bump stocks, high capacity mags & war weapons available to anyone!
5431 2018-02-15 01:07:44 Why aren't you doing anything to help resolve this gun violence issue?!?
"Praying" is just white noise at this point.
Where's the ban on bump stocks??
Big talk about denuclearizing NK when you can't even do anything about gun violence & in a school for god's sake.
5432 2018-02-15 01:07:42 Should have banned bump stocks, ARs, all that shit, long time ago.  It takes one shot to kill a deer.
5433 2018-02-15 01:07:10 Heres an interesting punishment, have them put in stocks in the centre of London and have the public do whatever they want to them
5434 2018-02-15 01:06:31 Let me be clear. I don’t believe in bump stocks, I don’t believe in civilian ownership of fully automatic weapons. But I do believe in gun ownership for legal uses. Hunting, sports and self protection as provided by the constitution.
5435 2018-02-15 01:06:01 Still waiting on the law which outlaws bump stocks.............. “Now is not the time they say” but when?
5436 2018-02-15 01:06:00 Yep. I read it in an article in the Florida times union several months back. I believe it was an ap article on different people and the stocks they own.
5437 2018-02-15 01:05:59 America: Where the right to own an AR-15, bump stocks, and 30+ round magazines is more important than children not getting killed when they go to school. #ThoughtsAndPrayers
5438 2018-02-15 01:05:58 Ban assault weapons and bump stocks, better background checks, closing gun show loopholes would be a fantastic start. SAVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN!!!
5439 2018-02-15 01:05:51 Great for the stocks , I see the price has been. Increasing recently.
5440 2018-02-15 01:05:29 Sensible solutions:
The first thing we should do is to prohibit bump stocks or any device to make guns automatic. We should prohibit large capacity magazines. We could set a date for when these devices would need to be turned in.
5441 2018-02-15 01:04:24 Awesome job man! How long are you trading now? I have been paying options on ajs and spartans calls and had way more success than trading options rather than simple stocks. Its great to see others be successful with options 
5442 2018-02-15 01:04:09 Kind of can’t believe you have the nerve to post this. Fix gun legislation (start with banning bump stocks and requiring background checks). Stop accepting the NRA’s blood money. #DoSomething
5443 2018-02-15 01:04:08 Ban assault weapons and bump stocks, better background checks, and closing gun show loopholes is a good start! SAVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN!

5446 2018-02-15 01:03:44 Semi-autos, yes. Bump stocks, no. Semi autos are great for hunting, especially hogs which cause millions in damages a year.
5447 2018-02-15 01:03:29 Sure there is. It's the same caliber as numerous hunting rifles. Educate yourself. Having stocks and various attachments makes them no more dangerous.
5448 2018-02-15 01:03:26 All @POTUS &  @GOP thoughts & prayers have done is brought about an increase in massacres & school shootings. Time for sensible gun laws, outlaw bump stocks, large magazines & military weapons. Need registration & serial #’s on all guns. The children will pay until you do.
5449 2018-02-15 01:03:15 Sadly Congress will do Nothing to stop these killings. Even after the mass shootings in Las Vegas,They wouldn’t even passed legislation to make bump stocks illegal. Whether they’re afraid of what the gun lobby can do, or whether they are just dependent on their campaign money ...
5450 2018-02-15 01:03:12 Grow up. Military weapons - and bump stocks - are inappropriate for citizens. The death of all the children in school massacres, churches, concerts are on you.
5451 2018-02-15 01:02:50 How much would it cost to ban assault weapons? Bump stocks?
5452 2018-02-15 01:02:43 Malungkot ka pa nyan eh may 30% gain port mo. Sell na yan. Then invest to new stocks.
5453 2018-02-15 01:02:34 I've always been pro 2nd amendment but these guys won't even get rid of their bump stocks. There's something really wrong.
5454 2018-02-15 01:02:29 No—Large Institutional Buying Today, in Most Stocks. Has the Look of just Short-covering & Holding.  #MarketTimer
5455 2018-02-15 01:02:24 Stricter regulation of who gets what weaponry would go a long way. Those are two examples of improvements that do not necessitate confiscation.
Background checks. Banning high capacity magazines, bump stocks, or objects with similar attributes.
5456 2018-02-15 01:02:07 I mean, when debating banning bump stocks you said it was easy to convert to automatic with a belt loop or any number of things. So a ban on bump stocks would do no good. #ksleg
5457 2018-02-15 01:01:50 Pass better background checks,ban on assault weapons and bump stocks and closing gun show loopholes would be a fantastic start!  SAVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN!!
5458 2018-02-15 01:01:45 @realDonaldTrump AR-15 RIFLES AND BUMP STOCKS ARE NOT SPORT WEAPONS !!!!
THEY ARE 100% MURDER WEAPONS !!!!! THEY MUST BE BANNED NOW !!!!!!!
MOST OF AMERICA WOULD BE WITH YOU ON THIS-PLEASE SPEAK OUT....!!!!
5459 2018-02-15 01:01:31 Jim, I wrote @RepComstock after the Vegas shootings to start writing legislation to outlaw bump stocks, something the NRA and GOP supports. Can you look into where Congress is on this?
5460 2018-02-15 01:01:28 I wasn't yelling or screaming, reread. I was requesting the congressmen and Senator make this an issue. Ok ... let's say all of your examples were accepted. Would you be willing to concede to universal background checks and stop selling bump stocks ?
5461 2018-02-15 01:01:26 You have a lot to learn in this country.I have friends who have given their guns up because of broken stocks,bubbled barrels,or just to costly to repair.That's what they get in these buy back programs,just old guns from honest citizens.
5462 2018-02-15 01:01:22 The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. That includes your dreaded bump stocks.
5463 2018-02-15 01:01:12 Keep your 2nd amendment- full out BAN sales of automatic, semi, magazines and bump stocks. This is NOT a mental health issue .. this is premeditated mass murder w ONE TRIGGER PULL!
5464 2018-02-15 01:01:07 I only like Valentine's day bc of the beautiful flower arrangements you don't always get to see. I don't like it bc it saddens me seeing disposed flowers and vendors still having a lot of stocks by night - then disposing it.
5465 2018-02-15 01:01:00 If @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr would have passed reasonable #guncontrol after #SandyHook (i.e. no assault rifles, no huge magazines, no bump stocks, etc) people killed in #LasVegasShooting & #ParklandShooting would likely still be alive! 12 SCHOOL shootings in less than TWO MONTHS
5466 2018-02-15 01:00:29 You just take away their high powered rifles, 100 round magazines, bump stocks, .50 calibre guns, semi automatics, full automatics. Leaving them to lumber around a musket, a blunderbuss and their duelling pistols.
5467 2018-02-15 01:00:11 I think three stocks might be a step in the right direction for Smash 4. Part of the reason people hate characters like Bayo so much is that she can suddenly just take a stock suddenly, and losing a stock is so easy. Melee has 4 stocks, Brawl had 3, why should 4 only have 2?

Market wisdom from #HarveySawkin on Episode 75 of the #InvestLikeTheBest Podcast:

"In a bear market, u have to go out back and kill all your darlings. Even stocks u love and think in the long term are great companies.  You gotta sell 'em."
5469 2018-02-15 01:00:03 I never said ban all gun. I doubt you feed your family with semi automatics and bump stocks.

5471 2018-02-15 00:59:14 Yes! Better background checks, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, closing gun show loopholes would be a fantastic start!  SAVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN!!
5472 2018-02-15 00:58:58 @ChrisMurphyCT be Bold: we want the names of EVERY representative who VOTED against bump stocks!
5473 2018-02-15 00:58:52 Good day on Wall Street: Bumper Stocks are up but we’re down 17 kids.
5474 2018-02-15 00:58:40 Would love to retweet this 100,00 times!  NRA controls the Republicans, what happened to the investigations of the Las Vegas bump stocks???  Ppl selling guns and ammo get big $$$$$ @SpeakerRyan wake the F up & think what Jesus would do- you don’t u r a hypocrite
5475 2018-02-15 00:58:22 AR 15, extended magazines, bump stocks, and background checks.
There is only one reason the fucking NRA doesn't want that.
GREED....this has zero to do with the 2nd ammendment
5476 2018-02-15 00:58:10 @DerrickGaffney Bump stocks were deemed legal by the Obama AFT. The NRA supports fixing the background check system. States should be required to provide the FBI with pertinent info in a timely matter. As for the military I would think one word from Mathis and it should be done.
5477 2018-02-15 00:57:59 Screw the @NRA! No automatic weapons, no bump stocks. Yes full background checks.
5478 2018-02-15 00:57:49 You've made a choice: you'd rather have children massacred every couple weeks than limit bump-stocks, high-capacity mags, AR-15's. Do something better than choosing death. #GunControlNow
5479 2018-02-15 00:57:48 When bump stocks weren’t outlawed after Vegas, what more will it take to realize assault weapons are not needed to hunt, but to kill. Humans. Innocent humans. No one had a chance who encountered this mad man today.
5480 2018-02-15 00:57:44 @jaketapper Jake, I wrote @RepComstock after the Vegas shootings to start writing legislation to outlaw bump stocks, something the NRA and GOP supports. Can you look into where Congress is on this?
5481 2018-02-15 00:57:35 And bump stocks are back
5482 2018-02-15 00:57:17 #GunControlNow what are doing @Congress40th ? Ban Assault Rifles, bump stocks, large rounds of ammunition. Don’t merely say “thoughts and ”
5483 2018-02-15 00:57:11 You've made a choice: you'd rather have children massacred every couple weeks than limit bump-stocks, high-capacity mags, AR-15's. Do something better than choosing death. #GunControlNow

5485 2018-02-15 00:56:38 Jake, I wrote @RepComstock after the Vegas shootings to start writing legislation to outlaw bump stocks, something the NRA and GOP supports. Can you look into where Congress is on this?
5486 2018-02-15 00:56:29 Well I already know which stocks are going to jump tomorrow
5487 2018-02-15 00:56:05 Prayers. Literally the least you can do. You've made a choice: you'd rather have children massacred every couple weeks than limit bump-stocks, high-capacity mags, AR-15's. Do something better than choosing death. #GunControlNow
5488 2018-02-15 00:55:09 Congress has failed to make any progress.  They can’t even agree to ban “bump stocks” which convert semi-automatic rifles to automatic rifles.  POTUS is the voice of the NRA!
5489 2018-02-15 00:54:32 They're not safe because guns are so easily available.

Congress can't even regulate bump stocks.
5490 2018-02-15 00:54:22 It can be modified, bump stocks.
5491 2018-02-15 00:54:17 Bump stocks? Weren't legislators supposed to do something after mass murder in Las Vegas?
5492 2018-02-15 00:54:05 Iwanan muna bitcoin matagal pa ulit lilipad yan. Regular stocks muna 
5493 2018-02-15 00:54:04 I emailed @RepComstock a Dem after the Vegas shootings to start legislation outlawing bump stocks which the NRA and GOP support but therehas been no action. Why??
5494 2018-02-15 00:53:41 Better background checks, a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, and closing gun show loopholes would be a fantastic start!
5495 2018-02-15 00:53:35 Most cases--dollar, bonds, equities overall in sync; dollar & bonds stopped rising when stocks went kookoo. Fed can reverse all three w hawkishness.

5499 2018-02-15 00:52:51 REMEMBER THIS IN NOVEMBER&BEFORE IN SPECIAL ELECTIONS! VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS THEY WILL GET RID OF BUMP STOCKS, ASSAULT STYLE WEAPONS, REQUIRE BACKGROUND CHECK FOR EVERY SALE&CUT MAGAZINE SIZE! ZERO WILL BE DONE BY REPUBLICANS THEY'RE OWNED BY NRA&THE RUSSIAN MONEY!
5500 2018-02-15 00:52:43 What happened to bump stocks?  I am sick and tired of people not ever done no anything ....talk is cheap
5501 2018-02-15 00:52:43 Additionally, the 2nd amendment pertains to a well regulated militia, such as your states national guard, not a bunch of egomaniacs with penis extenders with bump stocks and 30 round magazines.  Look how far we went with airline security yet ZERO on gun violence.  Amazing, huh?
5502 2018-02-15 00:52:40 Bump stocks are still legal btw.
5503 2018-02-15 00:52:28 Current Price of #Bitcoin is $9430 #BTC $USTC #BREAKING #stocks
5504 2018-02-15 00:52:26 Why do conservatives keep framing this as liberals wanting to take all their guns away?  Not the case. 

Common sense to ban bump-stocks, semi-automatics, large magazines. 

You'll still have plenty of guns.
5505 2018-02-15 00:52:24 Zombie stocks will be sky rocketing tomorrow. Sad.
5506 2018-02-15 00:52:22 We could also make bump stocks illegal since we have already had one Massacre thanks to them and automatic weapons are already supposed to be illegal.
5507 2018-02-15 00:51:20 It's about time Congress (those guys in Washington that we help pay their salaries) get off their rears and get something done about this. They couldn't even agree about getting Bump Stocks off the streets.
5508 2018-02-15 00:51:14 And bump stocks are still available! Its ridiculous
5509 2018-02-15 00:50:55 National electronic background checks for EVERY gun sale (private or public). Bans on semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks and large magazines. National ELECTRONIC databases on gun violence. LOTS of things we could do. #gunsensenow
5510 2018-02-15 00:50:55 Action now, not lip service!  Ban assault weapons and bump stocks, better background checks, and closing gun show loopers would be a good start!
5511 2018-02-15 00:50:49 thats the point, look at what it takes to get a gun in japan but its still legal there, because of the process they significantly less shootings, its bullshit to say you cant stop any of these because you can, if bump stocks werent legal then as many would not have died in vegas
5512 2018-02-15 00:50:15 What about assault rifles and bump stocks?
5513 2018-02-15 00:49:30 @JoxPrimeTime @jlunce @MeltonTalks only reason wwe has lost money is because of Vinny Mac he's out of touch with what the fans want. Guarantee when triple H and Stephanie take complete control stocks will Skyrocket
5514 2018-02-15 00:49:30 Especially such a high number of dead. Just banning bump stocks, closing the gun show loop hole and insisting gun sellers wait until background check comes back clean would help. Strengthening the ATF to investigate would help, also.
5515 2018-02-15 00:49:11 It should be harder to buy guns. 
It should be harder to modify them with bump stocks. 
It should be harder to buy lots and lots of ammunition.
But it’s not, and for that we can thank the @NRA.
5516 2018-02-15 00:49:03 Something must be done!  Better background checks, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, and closing gun show loopholes!! Our children need Action Now out of our Congress!!
5517 2018-02-15 00:48:56 Another miscalculation by the DEMS. Should let it play out. The one “promise” GOP has kept is going to start taking the real economy down by the 2nd half. Stocks should likewise be down depending on interest rate increases. That will Trump’s excuse for everything.
5518 2018-02-15 00:48:35 So is it too soon to say we should probably ban bump stocks? You know... from that last shooting?
5519 2018-02-15 00:48:30 Also, we used to have huge amounts of stock options from our jobs. We could cash these out — no risk — we didn’t have to use them unless stocks went up. Once I experienced this, regular investing in stocks seemed silly.  We made thousands of dollars without risk.
5520 2018-02-15 00:48:27 We're talking about GOPs in Congress that won't even ban bump stocks!
5521 2018-02-15 00:48:24 Yeah that is what assault rifles are for, killing many people. You guys couldn’t even ban bump stocks. You are complicit
5522 2018-02-15 00:48:19 I’m not anticipating a retest, just looking at it as a possibility. Going to get clues from stocks up and down 4% daily.
5523 2018-02-15 00:47:42 It was invented by hallmark for fuck’s sake, and they basically wormed their way into the modern social framework just over 100 years ago to force people to buy their shit and empty inventory stocks
5524 2018-02-15 00:47:40 Kurt, that's absurd.  Eliminating military grade weapons and bump stocks, as well as preventing people with a history of violence and mental illness is common sense.  Where are you coming from and is the NRA in your pocket?
5525 2018-02-15 00:47:27 Before 1969 the NRA was an irreverent organization but since about 1975 it politicized and continues to stoke the fears of the Govt. restricting owners rights. After Las Vegas there was a push by ALL sides to limit “bump stocks” on all rifles, which allows for rapid fire...
5526 2018-02-15 00:46:58 If this was a sane world, I'd expect to wake tomorrow to news of better gun control. However, I fully expect to wake to news of an increase in share values on gun manufacturer stocks. #GunControlNow #StockMarketCrash #NRAownsCongress #Resist #Remove
5527 2018-02-15 00:46:53 STFU I’m checking my stocks bitch
5528 2018-02-15 00:46:50 Remember when we were going to look into bump stocks? A small but correct step towards progress?
5529 2018-02-15 00:46:46 So it's not murderers who are funding them. But I agree that they shit it down for money. I, again, have no problem banning bump stocks
5530 2018-02-15 00:46:45 Ban bump-stocks, ban AR -15.
5531 2018-02-15 00:46:20 Wtf does that have to do with anything? What have you done to ban bump stocks ?High capacity magazines? AK s? Your complicit in all this do something you think founding fathers envisioned this?
5532 2018-02-15 00:46:18 Louis Bacon's Moore Capital bet on casino stocks in the fourth quarter of last year, a filing shows.
5533 2018-02-15 00:46:08 Please use your influence to enact better background checks, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, closing gun show loopholes. ACTION IS NEEDED FOR OUR CHILDREN NOW!!!
5534 2018-02-15 00:46:07 Gun stocks are likely to go up after today’s shooting in Florida. Here’s why:
Partly because people fear of another shooting attack and partly because of gun crackdown restricting them. 

POTUS is responsible for have relaxed gun laws. 

Shame.
5535 2018-02-15 00:45:48 Remember that outrage about bump stocks after Vegas?  Even the NRA at least faked being in favor of limit.  What happened to that with so much bipartisan support?  #activelysupportingmassmurder
5536 2018-02-15 00:45:46 I mean semiautomatic assault rifles, and bump stocks.
5537 2018-02-15 00:45:32 Thanks. As you can see releasing news doesn't mean stocks go up. The market has a mind of its own.
5538 2018-02-15 00:45:21 Because a stupid amount of powerful weapons and modifications such as bump stocks remain legal on the market.
5539 2018-02-15 00:45:07 Asia AM Digest: US Dollar Gets No Love After CPI Beat, Stocks Up
The US Dollar got no love on Valentine’s Day in the aftermath of a local better-than-expected CPI report. Wall Street ended higher and the New Zealand Dollar rose...
5540 2018-02-15 00:44:36 Every time it's the same mantra. Our hopes and prayers to the victims and families while the NRA howls with indignation at a even a ban of bump stocks.
5541 2018-02-15 00:44:31 Time to do something Marco. You are a good guy with influence that understands collaborating.  Use it and stop this madness. Ban bump stocks. Close the gun show loophole. Just DO SOMETHING. No action=unacceptable
5542 2018-02-15 00:43:32 Law enforcement is useless as long as there are no laws to protect the public from semi-automatics and bump stocks.
5543 2018-02-15 00:43:18 So if you are elected, will you introduce legislation to ban assault rifles, bump stocks, etc??.Or will you sell your soul to the NRA, like most of the GOP?
5544 2018-02-15 00:43:14 Please fight for better background checks, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, and closing gun show loopholes! Our legislators MUST ACT!!
5545 2018-02-15 00:43:08 What bill will be introduced in congress TOMORROW that will ban bump stocks, magazines & assault rifles, @DWStweets? 
THOUGHTS & PRAYERS AIN'T CUTTING IT!!!!
@hardball
5546 2018-02-15 00:43:07 There's no reason for any civilian (sane or otherwise) to have a semi-automatic weapon. If semi-automatic weapons and devices like bump stocks were illegal and consequently less readily available, mass shootings of this sort would at least be more difficult to plan and carry out.
5547 2018-02-15 00:42:55 Why does a civilian need an AR15?  

And, why haven't bump stocks been banned?  Haven't heard they were used in this shooting, but could be in the next (we all know there'll be a next). 

Please Sen Rubio - more than just thoughts & prayers.
5548 2018-02-15 00:42:25 They tried to ban bump stocks.  The NRA lobbied hardcore because other murderers give them lots of money to keep guns flowing.  The NRA could stop promoting an american gun culture just because they get money for it.
5549 2018-02-15 00:42:09 Once your done with that, how about pushing forward legislation banning assault rifles, bump stocks and stopping individuals with violent convictions from owning guns? Until then, talk to you when the next one will happen.
5550 2018-02-15 00:41:47 The Republicants

Can't ban bump stocks
Can't mandate background checks
Can't ban high capacity weapons 
Can't keep guns away from schools
Can't keep guns away from criminals, the mentally ill, or domestic abusers

Can't do sh*t.

Because the NRA owns them.

5552 2018-02-15 00:41:31 The Vegas shooter did have the bump stocks, not full auto. And he injured over 600 people. That’s a problem.
5553 2018-02-15 00:41:26 The ass hats in DC can't even get to together and do something about bump stocks. Faith-based gun control, pray that you don't get shot
5554 2018-02-15 00:41:15 expect the same action by trump & ryan like they did with bump stocks after the Vegas mass shooting!  NOTHING! NOTHING! THIS IS SHAMELESS CATERING TO GUN LOBBY! AND OUR KIDS ARE BEING HURT!
5555 2018-02-15 00:41:02 Are you being sarcastic? I can't tell and I like your opinions on stocks.
5556 2018-02-15 00:40:54 14 breakouts cont: $WIX (gap, base and 200-day MA). Two sub-$1. Small but select set of stocks. Good chance for these candidates to gain
5557 2018-02-15 00:40:22 I would imagine the first asset class was real estate, followed by commodities  (corn, metals, oil etc), then equities  (stocks etc) and bonds. 
You can divide these down further but in general a new asset class is extremely rare and crypto & BTC is just that.
5558 2018-02-15 00:40:14 They are working, there's no gun store in the entire country that will sell you an automatic weapon. I don't even care about bump stocks, if there's a motion to ban those as well, go for it.
5559 2018-02-15 00:40:05 another shooting? 
@NRA @VP @realDonaldTrump  = nobody gives a crap
they are are sleeping in the same bed! 

fear fear fear ( it's those people ) 
gun sales
NRA gets richer
mass shooting 
gun stocks grow higher
manufacturers get richer

prayers until the next shooting
tomorrow??
5560 2018-02-15 00:40:03 I know your talking the markets down. What happens when retail bond holders swap into stocks.
5561 2018-02-15 00:39:59 The planner is not an informed nutritionist. He or she is NOT qualified to make decisions. Precisely just like all the rest of heads of admin of Trump’s!
Laughing Stocks!
5562 2018-02-15 00:39:56 Please show me in the 2nd amendment specifically where it says you have the right to an AR-15, cop killer bullets, bump stocks, etc. this has to stop and it starts with people like you removing their heads from their asses.
5563 2018-02-15 00:39:55 Yep, we know the drill, prayer and condolences followed by crickets from the U.S. Congress. Still waiting for bump-fire stocks to be made illegal, people on a terrorist watch list can buy a gun. Parents will continue to bury their children, of this i have no doubt.
5564 2018-02-15 00:38:34 Congress sucks. None of these jerks have done ANYTHING about banning bump stocks or even enacting #CommonSenseGunLaws. Unacceptable.
#VoteThemOut
5565 2018-02-15 00:38:33 How would the stocks and bonds do that?
5566 2018-02-15 00:38:12 Ban assault style weapons. If people want to fire them, offer a controlled venue for that. Ban bump stocks. Ban drum magazines. Ban armor piercing bullets. If Congress does not do these things, we should vote them out. Enough is enough. Sooner or later it’s going to be your kid.
5567 2018-02-15 00:38:09 Do you think the 19-yr-old kid shooter has a gun problem? 1) ban the NRA from political campaign donation & from lobbying, 2) ban bump-stocks, auto & semi-automatic weapons, limit mags purchased, 3) mandate gun safety classes, 4) Give vics rights to sue #NRA/minor perp’s parents
5568 2018-02-15 00:38:08 @realDonaldTrump. Sad for families. Good business for The @NationalRifleA National Rifle Association of America, and  American nonprofit organization that advocates for gun rights, and profit from them, keeping the stocks high, elite happy, and workers...
5569 2018-02-15 00:38:03 ITS NOT GENIUS ITS A SHAM THAT THEY BUY STOCKS OR HELP OUT A GOOD OL BOY WAKEUP THIS IS A SUPPORT SYSTEM TO THOSE WHO NEED IT/SO Y NOT GET THE JOBS TO PAY AMERICANS LIVABLE WAGES NOT THE PART TIME HOME DEPOT OR WALMART JOBS RAISE THE MINIMUM TO 17HR IN THESE PLACES
5570 2018-02-15 00:37:44 Can’t we all agree that we need better background checks, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, and closing the gun show loophole??  We need to hold the NRA RESPONSIBLE for not at least moderate control!
5571 2018-02-15 00:37:33 Open discussion:

What reasonable gun law changes would have prevented or lessened the recent mass shootings? 

Bump stocks is on that list I think...but when using "reasonable" I can't come up with much else. 

Assault rifle man? Ok.maybe....define what an assault rifle is first
5572 2018-02-15 00:37:30 Welcome to the USA. Please pick up your AR-15s, magazines and bump stocks on the next table, plus maps of areas were you can take out as many of our citizens and children as you like. @NRA & US Congress are murder accomplices. Hold them accountable. @AdamSchiffCA @SenKamalaHarris
5573 2018-02-15 00:36:59 @JohnCornyn The prayers and condolences of Trump re: school shootings mean nothing. Do something to stop the violence. Ban semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks. #GunControl
5574 2018-02-15 00:36:55 because only @StocksToTrade cares about shit stocks like this :)
5575 2018-02-15 00:36:50 It's all our lives now, Joe, because nothing is ever done, save to make things even worse.

Remember Donald's 1st gun bill? It let people declared mentally incompetent buy firearms. And after LV, bump stocks are still legal.
5576 2018-02-15 00:36:47 And no damn bump stocks or silencers.
5577 2018-02-15 00:36:28 Bump stocks, too.
5578 2018-02-15 00:36:19 Bump stocks are not full auto conversions, they change nothing mechanically about the gun so your argument is invalid.
5579 2018-02-15 00:36:18 @tedcruz The prayers and condolences of Trump re: school shootings mean nothing. Do something to stop the violence. Ban semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks. #GunControl
5580 2018-02-15 00:36:17 Your prayers and condolences won't save a single human life. A ban on semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks might.
5581 2018-02-15 00:36:16 We also need to pass common sense gun reform. Assault weapons, bump stocks (remember them?), gun show loopholes - all need to be addressed legislatively.
5582 2018-02-15 00:36:05 Don't forget bump stocks (Like in Las Vegas) that can make them fire nearly as fast as full automatic, that they promise to ban and then did nothing.
5583 2018-02-15 00:35:54 @option_snipper Hello friend, amazing trades, thank you for sharing. A doubt,
the chart for $SPY is Daily with 5 moving average? and stocks 60 min with 60 MA?
Great work!
5584 2018-02-15 00:35:47 Do you support the legalization of silencers on guns?  Do you support bump stocks?  Do you support a semiautomatic AR-15 assault rifle?  #Parkland #SandyHook #gunsense #GunControlNow #VegasShooting
5585 2018-02-15 00:35:37 FU$& YOU! NO ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY, OWN, OR POSSESS AN AR 15 AND MULTIPLE MAGAZINES. OR ANY OTHER GUN THAT HAS MORE THAN 10 ROUNDS. NO BUMP STOCKS! GUN CONTROL NOW!!!!!
5586 2018-02-15 00:35:16 Machine guns should not be for sale to regular citizens. This are for military use. Ridiculous. Background check loopholes should be closed. Bump stocks out lawed. Changes requested in light of current weak gun laws.
5587 2018-02-15 00:35:00 @RepBillFlores The prayers and condolences of Trump re: school shootings mean nothing. Do something to stop the violence. Ban semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks. #GunControl
5588 2018-02-15 00:34:22 Did the Vegas shooter having 20+ LEGALLY purchased firearms & bump stocks make your home safer? I kinda doubt that. It's the inability to give even 1 inch on controlling this proliferation that's to blame. 
Sorry if that's an inconvenient truth for you!
5589 2018-02-15 00:34:20 Then DO IT!!!  Lead. Do not allow NRA $$ dominate your peers. Where is the legislation on bump stocks?  THIS IS A HEALTH CRISIS.
18 mass shootings week 7 of the year. Explain??

5591 2018-02-15 00:33:12 What good would armed stocks and bonds do?

#GunSenseNOW
5592 2018-02-15 00:33:03 By using an AR 15 assault rifle.  I'm old enough to remember when these were banned, until your party under GWB allowed the Ban to lapse.  So to minimize loss of life in the next shooting, how about supporting a ban on all assault weapons.  And for good measure, bump stocks. Ok?
5593 2018-02-15 00:33:00 Well that's true about individual shooting and killing, but mass murders such as the Las Vegas shooting and dozens more where masses of people are murdered in cold blood have ALL been committed with rapid-fire assault weapons. We still don't have a ban on bump stocks.
5594 2018-02-15 00:33:00 It won’t matter what you& gov Scott do. You won’t  go against the all powerful #NRA &outlaw bump stocks/large magazines/military weapons/common sense gun laws/stringent background cks/put serious resources into mental health. Thousands of children have died/injured & traumatized!
5595 2018-02-15 00:32:35 Bruh they didn’t even ban those bump-stocks. #congress will never do anything on guns #shooting #Florida
5596 2018-02-15 00:32:29 Reply ok I’ll agree ban bump stocks next? What else do you propose to fix the problems
5597 2018-02-15 00:32:19 @Harris4Congress Congressman, What action will you take to reduce gun violence? Will you demand a bill to ban sale of bump stocks? Restrict sale of AR15 style weapons?
5598 2018-02-15 00:32:18 ah okay. yeah so these "normal" people out here need bump stocks and ar-15's that are perfectly legal to buy. people that are terrorist watch lists can buy guns. we haven't updated the second amendment since it was developed and had guns that shot one bullet per minute.
5599 2018-02-15 00:32:05 We must call for better background checks, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks and closing gun show loopholes!  We Are the ADULTS IN THE ROOM!
5600 2018-02-15 00:32:01 They can be made to simulate full auto. Not be full auto. Bump stocks should be mandated.
5601 2018-02-15 00:31:53 I mean it shouldn’t be hard to do some things. No one wants to take all guns away. 1) have a background check 2)ban unnecessary things like bump stocks 3)have people register guns similar to cars. Severe penalty if found unregistered
5602 2018-02-15 00:31:37 You will change your position when this hits one of your loved ones. Bump stocks, assault rifles ... they should be BANNED without a special law enforcement permit.
5603 2018-02-15 00:31:12 Bans don't work. Massachusetts just ban bump stocks and only got 4 of them off the street.
5604 2018-02-15 00:30:50 ...them your thoughts and prayers, cuz those don’t save lives. Those don’t stop the next active shooter. Those don’t bring back the children they lost. Stop kissing the ass of the NRA and get rid of bump stocks and make mental health checks part of gun ownership....
5605 2018-02-15 00:30:49 NO DEMOCRAT SHOULD TAKE NRA MONEY. REPUBLICANS WON'T EVEN TAKE UP A VOTE TO BAN BUMP STOCKS! VOTE BLUE WE CAN CHANGE THE COUNTRY W MAJORITIES AND PRESIDENCY. TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK! REASONABLE GUN LAWS!
5606 2018-02-15 00:30:37 Columbine, Aurora, Sandy Hook, Pulse, San Bernadino, Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas.... Parkland.  Why should any run-of-the-mill citizen need access to an AR-15.  Don't think your founding fathers had AR-15's and bump stocks in mind when they espoused the right to bear arms.
5607 2018-02-15 00:30:22 Stocks closed higher on Wednesday after reports showed slumping retail sales but a rate of inflation that exceeded estimates.
5608 2018-02-15 00:30:11 just don’t get it. kids lost, lives changed forever, and people in politics still think there’s actually an argument against things like background checks, bump stocks etc.?  what world am I living in?
5609 2018-02-15 00:30:05 But the reason I posted the Wills article is because none of that can happen if we treat the gun like a religious object. We have to start somewhere. And right now, we can't even agree to regulate bump stocks.
5610 2018-02-15 00:30:01 @DeanHeller
Wake up Dean the United States is not safe
18 shooting in public schools 
Churches, movie theaters, night clubs, all have been targets
Add Parkland to the list of tragic school shootings
The Blue Wave will regulate bump stocks, 10 shot magazines NRA Dark Money
250 day
5611 2018-02-15 00:29:51 And bump stocks are still legal, aren’t they Paul Ryan?
5612 2018-02-15 00:29:15 What are you going to do about it?  You didn’t ban bump stocks after the Vegas massacre. Will you now or does the NRA have you by the balls like it does every other Republican hack?
5613 2018-02-15 00:29:14 "Mr Munger did not hesitate to address his own advancing years. Most investors will have a harder time than he and Mr Buffett did in making money from stocks, he said, “but I’m about to die and you aren’t. You don’t want to trade your position for mine.” Good point @TheCharlieton
5614 2018-02-15 00:29:10 This is a good conversation to have. But the #GOP won't even go for universal background checks and the banning of bump stocks.
5615 2018-02-15 00:29:01 When iPhone in general is the crack cocaine that @Apple is addicted to, it will be an upstart, a disruptor, that yet again, arises “out of nowhere”, to deliver consumer value and shareholder benefits & wealth. Mega-large-cap stocks (top 10 valuations), will not.
5616 2018-02-15 00:28:10 @realDonaldTrump We have to be nice to you, so stocks will be nice to you too. Everything will be find in the market. Be used to up and down. It's fun and it's normal.
5617 2018-02-15 00:27:41 how are the stocks doing
5618 2018-02-15 00:27:35 How about childhood shooting victims?  Any solutions in sight? How about those bump stocks
5619 2018-02-15 00:27:31 Ok please enlighten me. I’m not a member of the NRA so I’m unaware of them blocking legislation on bump stocks. Provide data please. What is your end game here? Complete ban of weapons? I’m curious as to what you would suggest to alleviate the issue.
5620 2018-02-15 00:27:21 FUN FACT My Representative @repdavid Schweikert voted FOR a National Conceal and Carry Law. Voted AGAINST banning bump stocks a week after the #LasVegas Massacre and receives campaign contributions from the GUN LOBBY.
5621 2018-02-15 00:27:00 According to the NRA aka the Devil's Lobby, background chks, won't help, assault rifle ban, won't help...ban on semi-automatic/bump stocks, won't help, limiting locations...limiting individuals...limiting conceal permits...WON'T HELP. So why keep asking them?
5622 2018-02-15 00:26:53 As long as wall street is buying, and we're breaking resistances and building new supports, I'm all good with starting a new bull run right now :) (Well, I called bullish when stocks went down and we diverged up :) )
5623 2018-02-15 00:26:19 And Gun Stocks too.....
5624 2018-02-15 00:26:14 They talked about bump stocks after Vegas but didn’t do shit after and so don’t count on anything happening
5625 2018-02-15 00:25:51 Yes, we see a Day 4 follow-through. Choppy trade could continue, given 1) relative shallowness of the correction; 2) potential for heavier selling in #bonds; 3) a renewed rise in #crude #oil. But for now, the market has signaled a confirmed uptrend #stocks
5626 2018-02-15 00:25:02 Good tweet. Works because central bankers are feckless and their real mission is don’t let stocks go down too much.  Basically BTFD forever
5627 2018-02-15 00:24:48 I’m also for banning Automatic weapons to average citizens. I’m for banning bump stocks and other rigs that allow a gun to fire automatic. Increasing border patrol in efforts to prevent illegal drugs and guns from entering the country. Increasing funding for Coast Guard
5628 2018-02-15 00:24:38 It ain't just about assault weapons bans and banning bump stocks. 

Mental health needs to be at the forefront of people's thoughts and allow progress in our society. Not just brushing off that this was a "sick guy". There are many like today's shooter who could yet be stopped.
5629 2018-02-15 00:24:32 Well now, that explains it all.  I'm sure Jesus is just fine with all your mass shootings, bump stocks, semi automatic rifles and school shootings,  since He was a man of peace and all.  You ma'am are the very definition of hypocrisy. 
 Shame on your convenient Chritianity.
5630 2018-02-15 00:24:30 Okay, now you're just f'ing trolling.
For the benefit of others...
Universal background checks
Ending the gun show loophole
Banning bump stocks
Limiting ammo capacity
Banning assault rifles.
5631 2018-02-15 00:24:05 Keeping guns out of the hands of those who would do harm is the answer. And bans on bump stocks.  And bans on semi automatics. Thoughts, prayers and love are comforting and give hope but they do not solve the problem.
5632 2018-02-15 00:24:00 Time and place was after Las Vegas where bump stocks were going to be banned and mental legislation was going to be passed. Absolutely nothing happened and I am sick a tired of the media capatalizing on death for ratings. This is just a headline for them.
5633 2018-02-15 00:23:30 Thanks, NRA.  Trump when will u lead the Repugnants off their fat asses to lead common sense - reasonable gun control measures. The NRA should not rule American politics. The GOP has not even moved on "Bump stocks" after 500 people were shot????? @GOP @WhiteHouse
5634 2018-02-15 00:23:25 Must have missed the memo - went very long ( for life) last Thursday & Friday - after having gotten down to about 15% stocks.

Can’t believe the rebound nor the movement in portfolio at 5x our normal positioning... 
5635 2018-02-15 00:23:05 @HardballChris Enough of your guests saying these shootings will continue until the voters decide we've had enough. We HAVE decided but our representatives ignore us. Most want all background check loopholes closed, bump stocks banned, where are the laws?
5636 2018-02-15 00:22:54 there have BEEN no laws FOLLOWING these incidents
that's the problem
the @GOP, in charge, take MUCH money from the @NRA
so allow NO laws, no changes to laws
NOTHING
until we try SOMETHING, NOTHING WILL change
no bump stocks stopped
this admin JUST allowed MENTALLY ILL to own guns
5637 2018-02-15 00:22:41 No dount. When I saw the silencers and the Assult Weapons plus bump stocks made available.
5638 2018-02-15 00:22:27 And use all those sources and experts to persuade a reader towards an opinion of their own. An expert in stocks will probably have a better understanding than someone who talked to someone.
5639 2018-02-15 00:22:25 Other countries, where assault weapons and bump stocks are banned do not have issues with mass shootings!!! Unfettered access to guns, tons of ammo, provides the opportunity for any disgruntled American to take out their frustrations by killing multiple people! #FloridaShooting
5640 2018-02-15 00:21:47 Nothing gets done because of the stranglehold the NRA has on the GOP. After Vegas, something was supposed to be done about bump stocks. But nothing was done.
5641 2018-02-15 00:21:30 Fuck the NRA. After the midterm Blue Wave take $5b & ban long guns / bump stocks / magazines > 10 rounds while offering a $5k buyback for every AR-15 and equivalent. 90 days until possession of long guns are illegal at the federal level. That’s what’s killing all these folks.

5643 2018-02-15 00:21:24 We’re in this cycle of debating amongst ourselves and not putting pressure on our representatives to protect state rights in setting their own gun laws, allowing researchers to study gun violence, to ban bump stocks, close background check loopholes for private or gun show sales
5644 2018-02-15 00:21:22 Then pick stocks, then tell @potus when to push it? #emolumentsclause
5645 2018-02-15 00:21:08 Oh then after he gets mental help the makes a shit tone of money selling penny stocks and is a shady stock broker married to Margot Robbie
5646 2018-02-15 00:20:59 Step 9: US Gun manufacturer stocks go up based on anticipated fear buying + discounts
5647 2018-02-15 00:20:39 Someone explain to me in a rational way why civilians need high capacity clips, assault rifles or bump stocks. I have been a gun owner my whole adult life and see no need for anyone to own these. Our children are our most precious resource. Schools should be safe places.
5648 2018-02-15 00:19:58 Bump stocks I could give two shits about, they waste ammo and most gun owners view that as a joke.
5649 2018-02-15 00:19:47 Them funding blocking legislation on things like bump stocks, high capacity magazines, military style weapons in civilian hands...need I continue...sure they didn’t pull the trigger, but they are complicit.  The AR15 isn’t used for hunting.
5650 2018-02-15 00:19:34 Only complaint so far is they don't allow trades in OTC stocks. Most of my money is in OTC, so I can only put a little money in rh. I would even pay to trade OTC as long as its reasonable.
5651 2018-02-15 00:18:52 Republicans want to cut aid to states. How can we make schools safer with Trump screwing the states for his and his cabinets $$ gain. TAX RETURNS TO SEE IF HE OWN GUN,OR AMMO STOCKS....TAXES !   ..DT
5652 2018-02-15 00:18:38 Guns KILL the Innocent!  "We're talking about bump stocks, we're talking about legislation. A child of God is dead. Can not we acknowledge in this country that we cannot accept this?" CNN Phillip Mudd
5653 2018-02-15 00:18:22 @Gianforte: “stricter laws against guns would not have prevented this” commenting on bump stocks.
“I can’t be bought," he says unless it’s $344,630 from the NRA. #mtpol
5654 2018-02-15 00:18:03 We must change our laws. Yes we have the 2nd amendment but I don't believe not being able to buy AR-15s or bump stocks is a RIGHT. People have a RIGHT to send their children to school have them be safe and have them return home. NO MASS SHOOTING is ACCEPTABLE. TOO Many lives Lost
5655 2018-02-15 00:17:17 I have tweeted similar Bill, We will hear the same speech’s and nothing will change. See bump stocks for example, And I’m a gun owner but something has to give. Congress please , please ,please do something.
5656 2018-02-15 00:17:16 Hey republicans, take your thoughts and prayers and shove them up your ass. How about common sense gun legislation? How's that ban on gun stocks coming??????  Assholes
5657 2018-02-15 00:17:12 All these shootings at schools, Las Vegas with bump stocks and we can’t get tighter gun control. I believe it’s because the NRA (pro Russia) and the REPUBLICANS are in Bed.
5658 2018-02-15 00:16:47 The fbi just admitted that there is a log jam on the banned list of guns 2017 was the biggest year where they are trying to add more guns to the list 85% of them are u guessed it automatic weapons and bump stocks
5659 2018-02-15 00:16:00 another mass shooting
prayers 
stocks in gun manufacturers get higher
NRA makes money
gun nuts buy more guns

repeat
repeat
repeat

nobody cares

@VP & @realDonaldTrump don't give a damn!
5660 2018-02-15 00:16:00 #GunControlNow  The GOP has no problems passing laws to ban abortions. But the GOP can't pass laws to ban AR-15 or bump stocks!  In private testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in November, Simpson alleged closed ties between the Russian government and the NRA.
5661 2018-02-15 00:15:04 What crumbs will our @NRA overlords will allow the lawmakers they own to dangle in front of us during this horrific news cycle, only to take them away when we turn our collective heads toward the next shiny new Trump tweet. Stick your thoughts and prayers up your bump stocks
5662 2018-02-15 00:13:37 Who would have thought 30 years ago that schools would be places of violent death. I was a teacher for 42 years. Schools should be places of safety. Shame on the NRA and the right for opposing reasonable gun legislation. No need for high capacity clips, bump stocks or AR15’s.
5663 2018-02-15 00:13:33 You ended the Assault Weapons Ban and now we have legalized bump stocks to make firing a weapon even faster. Y'all are trying to crush states' laws regulating firearms by putting in nationwide reciprocity so anyone with a weapon can travel anywhere with it.

What heart have you?
5664 2018-02-15 00:12:58 I am under the presumption that you forgot about the NRA making a statement that bump stocks should be illegal after the las vegas shooting? They don't want guns in the hands of criminals, they just want the ability to buy and use them for proper usages.
5665 2018-02-15 00:12:55 I mean, Jesus Christ, we couldn’t even ban bump stocks after Las Vegas. But one guy gets on an airplane with a shoe bomb, can’t even do that right, and now we all take our shoes off at the airport. A bad thing happened, and we took steps to stop it happening again.

5667 2018-02-15 00:12:36 Why is it one or the other? We need to confront this on all fronts.
Mental health awareness
Bullying
common sense gun safety
Ban assault rifles,.
limit ammo
No bump stocks
Legislation.
Mentally ill, domestic abusers, terrorists banned from gun ownership
5668 2018-02-15 00:12:00 Republicans+media will forget this in two weeks like they forgot bump stocks. Trump team will pay off another porn star to distract and everyone will forget 17 people died today bcz no one wants to get involved or be bothered with holding their reps responsible for doing nothing
5669 2018-02-15 00:11:57 If they’re”no fly”or mentally unstable,no guns.Longer waiting period,no gun shows,no gun parts purchasing-then put together rapid fire, no bump stocks.What American needs military grade weapons,tougher laws4illegal guns&it’sNOT harming 2ndAmendment-FoundingFathers never imagined
5670 2018-02-15 00:11:24 @petenajarian just looking at SIX it held up way better than a large % of stocks. Ever look at it.
5671 2018-02-15 00:10:32 Wtf ... please explain oh wise one how stricter gun control won’t make it harder to acquire semi automatic rifles or bump stocks? You have absolutely no idea
5672 2018-02-15 00:10:06 Why? So they can take more NRA money and do their bidding by doing nothing on this issue? Bump stocks haven't even been banned yet.
5673 2018-02-15 00:10:02 Massachusetts, I am proud to say, passed a bill making bump stocks illegal with pretty hefty penalties.
5674 2018-02-15 00:09:56 @RobinhoodApp will the app support shorting stocks in the upcoming months ?
5675 2018-02-15 00:09:37 I think they said an AR-15, but don’t quote me on that. I’ve been watching several different news channels. They aren’t sure if he used bump stocks or anything like that yet. I don’t carry a purse, but I get your point....
5676 2018-02-15 00:09:34 Gun laws vary state by state. Take what happened in Vegas 4 ex. There were 0 irregularities in the gunman's brain that explain why he shot 480 ppl, 58 of them fatally, last October, according to an autopsy

So MAYBE it was just easy access to an arsenal, bulk ammo & bump stocks?
5677 2018-02-15 00:09:34 Congress never outlawed Bump Stocks so Gun Reform is definitely out of the question. @workclassjane @pannlewis44 @LindaHaleRCSD

5680 2018-02-15 00:08:29 Get the NRA and gun lobbyist out of our government!
Ban Automatic Assault Weapons and bump stocks!
No gun show loopholes!
Congress needs to act!
The NRA should not own our government!
5681 2018-02-15 00:08:27 @POTUS @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @amyklobuchar @SenTinaSmith  prayers are not going to help these families. Only gun control is the answer. No citizen needs a semi-automatic weapon, or bump stocks. 1 of 2
5682 2018-02-15 00:08:02 The Las Vegas legislature, which meets every other year, won’t discuss banning bump stocks until January 2019. Nothing really changes.
5683 2018-02-15 00:07:31 Pleas stand up for better background checks, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks and closing gun show loopholes!  My  goes out to the victims and families.  This must stop. Stand up to NRA!
5684 2018-02-15 00:07:10 Heavily into Consumer discretionary stocks! I expect him to lag S&P this year too! The days of active management long past! There are many fiduciaries still who don't care for results but send money to their cronies in fund management!
5685 2018-02-15 00:06:03 It’s weird that sensible first steps like banning bumper stocks, requiring background checks and banning sales to people on the “no fly” list can’t even pass Congress but you jump immediately to “take away guns from everyone that owns them”.
5686 2018-02-15 00:05:55 Thoughts are good. Prayers are good. So are laws, safeguards, discussions, and state’s rights. Know what’s not good? Bump stocks God, damn it. And yes, I realize I have a gun in my profile picture. I don’t hate guns. I just think that access to them needs to be rethought.
5687 2018-02-15 00:05:39 It has to stop. That we haven't done a damn thing about bump stocks is really telling.
5688 2018-02-15 00:05:35 Thoughts and prayers again. These domestic troubled men have killed more than any terrorist in the US. Innocent people - children, people at church - #GOP do something! Y'all haven't even banned bump stocks yet.

5689 2018-02-15 00:05:34 Let's see. We lose, what about 200 people a day in these killings? Let's take away bump stocks and see if they try using cars and trucks and bombs. If they do, we'll give the bump stocks back.
5690 2018-02-15 00:05:31 There is no way to apply rational thought and be emotionless when dealing with this horrific violence. I was a teacher for 42 years. I’m a father and grandfather. Schools should be safe places. Assault rifles and bump stocks have no business in the hands of civilians.

5695 2018-02-15 00:03:59 Just waiting for Newt to dust off his usual ‘ this is the cost of freedom ‘ wisdom. And how about those bump stocks, Congress? I now turnoff US news after each mass shooting. Empty words, no action.
5696 2018-02-15 00:03:55 Ban automatic and seni automatic weapons. An large capacity magazines. Ban bump stocks. Period. Fucking crazy. #FloridaShooting
5697 2018-02-15 00:03:46 Remember when a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers said they would ban bump stocks after Las Vegas and fix the instant background check system after Texas? Neither happened.
5698 2018-02-15 00:03:41 Get the NRA out of our government! Mandate a special permit and background check for Automatic Assault Weapons for law enforcement only!
Ban bump stocks and gun shows!
Do something to keep kids safe!

3. the bump stocks reduced his accuracy & set off the smoke >

Las Vegas-AR-15/bump stocks
Texas church-AR-556
