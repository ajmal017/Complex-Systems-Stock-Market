9 2018-03-31 22:10:05 I don’t worry about stop losses with super deep value trades. I worry about things like dead money, negative roll yields & a lower Sharpe ratio from higher volatility; but  commodities are nice because they have an intrinsic value. Just gotta be patient and size accordingly (~5%)
10 2018-03-31 22:02:32 we have updated them with the invention of new technologies, new commodities, new nations (like after the fall of the USSR), etc. We simply cannot cling to the past if the past is causing us harm today.

32 2018-03-31 21:08:02 did I miss something? Oil is still the one of the most valuable commodities in the world.
33 2018-03-31 21:07:15 people with big accounts are still humans with lives and i would really like it if people stopped acting like we’re commodities that should do only what they want us to do!
34 2018-03-31 21:05:07 @matthaig1's How To Stop Time is one of my favourite books this year. An elegaic and eloquent meditation on time, that most precious of commodities whose abundance can easily become a curse. And it's a page turner to boot! Buy it for yourself. But it for someone you love.

36 2018-03-31 20:35:38 como desastre kirchnerista entiendo el haber desaprovechado una oportunidad unica en la historia de este pais en que se conjugaban: precios record de commodities, tipo de cambio real alto, y tasas internacionales bajas; dejando el pais en default y sin reservas.

43 2018-03-31 19:39:26 Se o Brasil assinar um acordo assim com a Europa, vai aumentar a dependência do País de commodities. Provavelmente, no curto prazo, poderá se beneficiar exportando mais soja. No longo prazo, o país vai voltar às relações metrópole-colônia.
44 2018-03-31 19:33:16 @LMT978 Do you trade commodities, include them in your signals group? Thanks.
45 2018-03-31 19:30:40 I also think it's also about the availability of commodities. Kwanga kuine mishonga here?

47 2018-03-31 19:22:14 i thought crypto currencies were regarded as commodities and you needed to pay capital gains tax on the profit ???
48 2018-03-31 19:21:32 Yep, it’s a free market were to show your ads, or not to show them. These companies obviously said to themselves it’s not in our interests to show our brand or commodities on this show. I wonder why they think so. Free market and consumer power is the answer.
49 2018-03-31 19:00:07 Porém o Brasil seria muito atrativo para a URSS, Cuba tem a proximidade com os EUA nós população e commodities...
50 2018-03-31 18:56:58 Sabes que luego del 2005 tuvimos una década con los precios de nuestros commodities por las nubes y que a pesar de eso tenemos mayor deficit fiscal que en 2004, la educación es un desastre, Mdeo está lleno de gente en la calle y los homicidios y rapiñas baten records?

52 2018-03-31 18:40:55 The banker who trades in commodities is a murderer.
53 2018-03-31 18:33:06 Sorry, I was referring to mining process as a whole. Coins by themselves are commodities, you are correct. Bit late here 
54 2018-03-31 18:31:00 Graeme, you’re spot on, amigo. If the sport is to attract more participants, it needs to be more accessible, and time is one of the most finite and precious commodities. Opportunity cost of 18 holes is high with family & other commitments.
55 2018-03-31 18:27:24 Mas de 80 mills de mexs no saben de commodities (materia prima) como lo manejan  prensa especializada, si esa materia la transformáramos n Mèx...,pero en materia de pol econ los gobs de ref han preferido la exp.

59 2018-03-31 17:11:01 A good book: NATURE'S METROPOLIS, Wm Cronon. A holistic history of why/ how the commodities industries grew so fast and the way they did. Population explosions cause providers to process large amts of necessities in a short period of time. Agree; cruelty shouldn't be part of it.
60 2018-03-31 17:10:35 Charged around 90k for trading in commodities & result is loss of almost 1.5 lakh. No proper explanation after repeated complaints for last 2 years. Still not received accident cover documents. Worst RM #ManishKharwar #worstbrokerage #NirmalBangDalhousiebranch @NirmalBang

63 2018-03-31 16:53:33 I’m saying hot commodities informally to mean self confidence. I have been sexually harassed by women all the time, especially older ones. Why does everything have to be a zero-sum game? Why can’t I just relate and laugh to a meme without being policed by feminists?
64 2018-03-31 16:50:09 Hot commodities?? Are you kidding me? And getting "hit on" really does not equal sexual harassment. It hit a nerve because you saying that your experience is the same as women's is messed up.
65 2018-03-31 16:47:56 Reliance on primary commodities will not take Africa any further, there is need for serious thought on Economic transformation!
66 2018-03-31 16:46:53 I just thought the meme was funny and related to it. It didn’t think it struck a nerve in people. I know women who get hit on the same as I do and they aren’t upset, they just realize, as do I, that they are hot commodities.
67 2018-03-31 16:46:44 Basic commodities prices shall shoot up, as additional costs are bound to be incurred with new timings for goods delivery. Probably one of the costliest Ramazan in recent history is few weeks away 
68 2018-03-31 16:37:06 This young man is a typical Nigerian. We are talking about stealing but he is comparing prices of commodities. These can't dwarty the question.
69 2018-03-31 16:22:29 We just need to look out side the box for solutions. I know how we can pay for the wall and help another country as well as our own at the same time. Commodities such as oil, gold, diamonds,etc can contribute trillions to the reframing of countries. But China is beating us to it.
70 2018-03-31 16:20:26 Com as commodities voando era o mínimo.
Massa de manobra é quem pensa q o meirelles não teve nada a ver com a roubalheira, e ficou inebriado c a "melhora econômica"como se isso fosse a prioridade do país. A prioridade é tirar tudo e todos que tem ligação c foro de SP

72 2018-03-31 16:19:46 Indeed, but Einhorn is in a spot of bother. Also Andurand?! Didn't commodities outperform in Q1 ?!
73 2018-03-31 16:18:08 When you first realize someone has swiped some stuff from your place, it's a sickening feeling. I wish I could tell them I don't value commodities as much as I value the good will of the people who come in here.
74 2018-03-31 16:14:08 my father was a commodities broker and I remember him keeping a huge book with all his charts up until 1988.  Metal edged ruler and uniball pens to document the open, close, top, and bottom for the day.
75 2018-03-31 16:01:35 stop objectifying men. we are not mere commodities that women can buy and own.

77 2018-03-31 15:54:41 I am glad you enjoy reading and Lean In had positive effect on you. Important fact: Sheryl Sandberg was selling personal data as commodities. Unethical. Unprofessional. Unacceptable. I hope one day she writes another book. Clean Out as a working title?
78 2018-03-31 15:42:51 How much was basic commodities in 2009? Nigeria is moving on the path of growth by the grace of God.
79 2018-03-31 15:40:09 Players are commodities, if he’s worth it the market will bear it, pure and simple

81 2018-03-31 15:36:11 Moving towards the path of goody governance with @APCNigeria ? Laughable. How much was price of basic commodities b4 2015 election, and how much now, yet no increase in Salaries to balance the equation. If you must know, Nigerians are poorer now. This is bad governance.
82 2018-03-31 15:26:51 Official export data revealed that China virtually halted exports of fuel, coal and key commodities to North Korea in the past few months before summoning Kim Jong Un to Beijing.

THE worst thing is giving CASH
vs Commodities e.g.
commodities need to be controlled to their point of use or don't do it at all.

84 2018-03-31 15:17:04 Umm doesn't this show commodities do badly in a recession??
85 2018-03-31 15:15:37 Überraschungen am Donnerstag bei der Mais- und Soja- Anbaufläche in den US. Gegen die Erwartungen wurde die Acreage bei Soja auf 89 Mio, bei Mais auf 88 Mio reduziert. Bei Soja wurde eine Erhöhung auf bis zu 92 Mio acres erwartet. Folge: starke Kurssprünge in beiden commodities.
86 2018-03-31 15:13:17 With the $140 billion IBM revealing to CoinDesk that it has been meeting with executives from commodities trading platforms, large corporations, and perhaps most importantly, central banks, to explore how cryptocurrencies can help save them money and generate revenue. (continue)
87 2018-03-31 15:10:23 Yes @SimonDoyle, I'm one of them. Thank you for confirming the very thing we @The3Million have known for a long time now: we've become no more than 'commodities' - somewhere between car parts and fish - that can be 'swapped' at will. @pvandck: thank you.
88 2018-03-31 15:09:56 What other rare commodities are people stocking up on before the economic contraction? What gems are you referring to?
89 2018-03-31 15:01:40 Rare commodities are worth more than good
90 2018-03-31 14:58:18 We pay an enormous amount to CAP which subsidises farmers to not farm in order to maintain high prices within EU & manipulate world commodities prices to prevent competition and third-world evelopment.
And yes, most of the benefit goes to upper-class landowners throughout the EU.
91 2018-03-31 14:57:32 Academics are market-oriented intellectuals whose goal is to turn all human potential into capitalist commodities.
92 2018-03-31 14:51:03 For a team like the Royals, service time and prospects are their two biggest commodities. If you’re wondering why they keep signing vets to play, protecting service time for the young borderline guys could be at play while the younger prospects develop a little more.
93 2018-03-31 14:37:58 People have tried to get Trump through Russia, a whore and now going after his business?  What next?  You should be going after Obama and Killary for selling our precious commodities to the enemy! Go after Hillary for TREASON!!!!
94 2018-03-31 14:27:53 When nearly everything is a capitalistic venture, privileges normally governed by common decency are considered commodities, and can be bought in bulk by those who have succeeded in capitalistic ventures. It is at once what makes this the land of the free and the marginalized.
95 2018-03-31 14:23:01 Public provisions—schools, water, roads, community safety & health— are not commodities traded on a market. They are not only for people who can pay for them. They are for everyone, provided by everyone. God’s Common Good. @TexasAFT @AFTunion @NPEaction @Sojourners
96 2018-03-31 14:22:03 "Now, it would seem THE FLOOD GATES ARE PREPARED TO OPEN, with the $140 billion IBM revealing to CoinDesk that it has been meeting with executives from commodities trading platforms, large corporations, and perhaps most importantly, central banks."
97 2018-03-31 14:16:41 I agree. Taxing should be a no no. A better option would be to get funded by commodities companies. Those who have heavy presence in the state or their competitors would embrace it. Transport company for logistics, brewery or water company for refreshments..etc
98 2018-03-31 14:16:29 Cocoa and Steel Lead First-Quarter Gains
Commodities prices rose more than 2% as global demand surged 
Sugar and iron drop sharply
99 2018-03-31 14:06:53 Someone always has to sell the shovels, but again these aren't commodities. It can't be compared to the gold eras.
100 2018-03-31 13:51:56 Mr Jaitly your inefficiency is hurting common man. There is increase in toll levy by 5 to 7 % from 01 April.  As a result the rates of commodities will also hike.

Mr PM kindly address this issue as u have not booked even a single perpetrator of fin fraud.

Change the FM for good
101 2018-03-31 13:43:40 Llevarlo a escala industrial aún no es sostenible porque el precio de los commodities destrozaria ese aspecto, y la competitividad que tanto necesita Colombia y el pregona (X2) no existiría

104 2018-03-31 13:15:21 Yes, so true. Team management, too, have a responsibility to help athletes understand their wider worth, and not make them feel like commodities.

106 2018-03-31 13:02:24 Comparing crypto market caps to company market caps make them look overvalued
Comparing crypto market caps to fiat currency and commodities make crypto look EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED.
Because that's the correct relative valuation.

107 2018-03-31 12:14:59 That is interesting. Makes my head hurt a little to say we’re considering effects on manuf workers and offsetting effects on commodities workers to get a net effect that... still ignores the whole Ricardian logic of why we trade (as they note).
108 2018-03-31 12:13:19 Because our children should be economic commodities, bought and sold like trinkets at the bazaar. 

And thank-you Brian. Teaching can be rewarding, but it is often thankless.
109 2018-03-31 12:10:36 1.I'm a member of a farmer family in Rajsthn. Procssd food is the secnd stage and focus on incrsing the export is good idea. But Farmers here expct good prices of commodities that are produced every year and honestly they don't even care who and how uses these commodities.
110 2018-03-31 12:05:08 China keeps printing and importing gold until paradigms shift. Then they devalue the yuan, and have a currency system set in place to import critical commodities. It’s almost an event horizon and it’s very difficult to say what will happen after. But their people don’t own guns.
111 2018-03-31 11:30:16 “Hot commodities” at @beilersdonuts ! They’re always sold out too! Definitely one of my favorites 
112 2018-03-31 11:22:55 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.

117 2018-03-31 10:42:44 Its very easy to put a price tag on commodities like oil ask #platts,try put a price on moments and sights that take away your breath
118 2018-03-31 10:26:59 I stopped reading you when you were repeatedly wrong about Donald, years ago now, so your analysis on him is ignored these days. Please stick to things you are likely to get correct, i.e. yesterday's commodities prices.
119 2018-03-31 10:23:54 What can you countries do to convert economic growth thats has been achieved driven by commodities and macroeconomic reforms into growth; growth that will ultimately lead to job creating and welfare improving.

126 2018-03-31 07:54:00 Sir is it a good time to go long on Gold and I am not sure how do we trade for commodities by Zerodha.. What instrument needs to be bought for long term. Can you guide
127 2018-03-31 07:53:28 Very true! we should concentrate on producing what we have been importing from them though substandard and am sure they will miss our prime commodities like; coffee, vegetables and flowers among others.

130 2018-03-31 07:35:57 Of course you have 8.5k likes !!!!! You are amazing, you encompassed in a few words what is happening to teachers and pupils in this messed up system. Our children are not commodities, teachers should be free to teach and children free to learn.
131 2018-03-31 07:32:57 Rojava? Lmao Anarkid

I will march into your little "socialist territory" and personally defeat every soldier in hand to hand combat myself, and enslave every child there in order to produce commodities for my Che Guevara t-shirt business.
132 2018-03-31 07:31:33 Countries specialise in specialisation in the production of commodities in which they have a comparative advantage.
133 2018-03-31 07:23:05 The Soviet Union had a similar plan for Aral Sea. Ecological concerns aside, economics are hard. Cost wld be greater than gdp of Niger, Cameroon, and Chad combined. You would have to believe hydropower and commodities pay for it all...
134 2018-03-31 07:20:59 Just landed in Cornwall....craving marmalade and a bath. Rare commodities in HK. Bliss.
135 2018-03-31 07:08:36 The only real surprising thing about this one is that the market fluctuation, the rise in demand for guns and ammo jacking up prices for guns, commodities, and machine tools, hasn't occurred yet. Honestly I think it's how the DNC pays for wall street money.
136 2018-03-31 07:05:20 @DNC @TomSteyer @FBI See the big picture! Worldwide corrupt governments working together thru wars to split regions for energy & commodities. DT removes any state dept restraints, wants to destroy all protections for oligarchy in USA! GOP want to retain power w/o the rule of law!
137 2018-03-31 06:50:18 From 1st April pay 5-7% more toll on NH : NHAI. As a result prices of essential commodities likely to shoot up.
138 2018-03-31 06:31:20 Prophet Musa looked after his people. Why don't we to look within our boarders? Commodities have sky rocketed. The $ is hoovering at 5100 Tomans. People can't afford it anymore . Look at the pharmlacies nd see how healthy we are .....!!!

140 2018-03-31 05:59:31 Academics are cowards who allow the capitalists to turn their minds into commodities, churning out new commodities (students).
141 2018-03-31 05:34:28 Zara basic t-shirts now start at 545 instead of 495. What more basic commodities. Hello diehard supporters! 
142 2018-03-31 05:10:03 BitNautic is a trading platform for commodities where importers, exporters, and producers of goods can trade their products. A genuinely base paramount platform, BitNautic aims to help. #bitnautic @bitnautic
143 2018-03-31 04:53:17 We have the awareness about our& our family members health.Nowadays the health problem increases with the base of the food commodities we consume.Basically we are the farm producers,fully adopting natural method only.we never bought anything as inputs from outsides.
144 2018-03-31 04:08:13 So basically, 100 years from now water will be one of the "commodities" and not a human right. One should invest on a farm and make borehole, your grand children will thank me.

149 2018-03-31 02:17:37 Commodities prices going only one way, and that is up! How are businessmen and business houses suppose to reap the benefits of #GST and pass on the same to customers? #GSTIndia
150 2018-03-31 02:02:48 Meanwhile marginalized ppl and trans women in particular will be murdered and abused bc out govt sees all sex work and sex workers as disposable commodities THEY use their fucking selves. #STIGMA #MoreDeadTransBodies
151 2018-03-31 01:40:29 If as individuals they treat people as commodities, collectively what will they be like what type of alliance will it bring such as an axis of power that we fought last century through two Wars. Are we at the precipice again? @SebGorka
152 2018-03-31 01:36:17 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
153 2018-03-31 01:20:36 Meanwhile, grain and other commodities that ship by train must compete for rail transport with oil shippments to ports, making the cost of living go up for Canadians. Until we have substitute industries don't kill existing prosperity. #Whoops! Totally #disfunctional. #cdnpoli
154 2018-03-31 01:13:10 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.
155 2018-03-31 00:57:59 Donald Trump treats others around him as disposable commodities based on what they can contribute to his massive undeserved ego. 

I refuse to lower my principles. Especially for that man and his disgusting mouth.
156 2018-03-31 00:56:48 No excuse for it. Still recent (sorry, current) in the movie industry that females are seen as commodities, over 40 years on. For art or for executive "relaxation", there is always a "justification" for exploitation and abuse.
157 2018-03-31 00:55:39 Bla bla bla same Ivandiijski doomsday crap. Unless China liberalizes and opens FULLY nobody would want to hold yuan and therefore yuan cant displace $. At the stage petroyuan and the likes can grant China more influence on commodities pricing and thats it.
158 2018-03-31 00:50:13 Well this world lacks a semi coherent and mutually understood symbolic order, which is basically like a big sandpit with no universal rules besides laws governing the conversion of resources to commodities. Like a needy, boring, difficult, unforgiving and thankless Minecraft.
159 2018-03-31 00:25:31 There are few commodities as political as food. And “post-truth” has smashed the previously bounded concepts of health-food-politics..the political just dropped into every consulting room across the nation  ....individual professional integrity is here....

161 2018-03-31 00:15:55 I understand how economics work. Don't worry. I'm just bringing this monstrosity of a law to your attention since it has obviously contributed to the oil prices (and the prices of basic commodities!!)
162 2018-03-31 00:08:25 On 22.08.17 I helped my mother withdrew from her mutual funds/unit trusts and traded the proceeds with FX and commodities. As at 31.03.18, Cash ROE is 10.62% (7mths + 9days). Mother should be very pleased!

204 2018-04-01 22:07:06 That 2014-15 team the following year was weird. We didn't have any known commodities going into the season because Troy and Kevin were so young. Guyn ended up getting hurt and Mick had the health thing. Honestly a miracle those guys won a tournament game, much less made it.

210 2018-04-01 21:11:38 Olá Rafi, pode comentar o PMI da China e as commodities e analisar a GFSA3 ? Obrigado!
211 2018-04-01 20:59:27 You're free to cancel NAFTA. Unfortunately for you, we now have piracy, thus the goods and commodities will be with us for a long time.
212 2018-04-01 20:56:57 The pound also crashed against the USD, which is what a majority of our commodities are traded in., but has now made a recovery.  Also our exports are through the roof with the EU due to the rates.
213 2018-04-01 20:44:42 Now do the statistics on how many commodities are consumed and are imported and exported for immigrants daily, monthly and annually then you'll see the true cost of immigration! Then project the exponential generation consumer growth over two future decades as to sustainability?
214 2018-04-01 20:35:25 Writing a paper for one of my master's degrees elective classes. Get's the writing prompt: Find and post a “cultural artifact” that is an example of one of the themes in our listening this week.

A) Women as commodities and/or objectification of women.

... Recalls @drunkcorpsint
215 2018-04-01 20:12:15 Now how about realizing that these players are commodities and should be paid?
216 2018-04-01 20:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
217 2018-04-01 20:01:02 Such steps usually have some impact at the stock/options/commodities exchanges all around the world...
218 2018-04-01 19:41:44 It's not intellectually lazy to watch the entire video where @scrowder specifically addressed the difference between public goods and commodities. Public goods are not unique to socialism, commodities are when defining a society as either capitalist or socialist.
219 2018-04-01 19:18:57 However, #commodity #trading is a battle between return and risk. Because of the leverage involved, you can achieve a higher rate of return than from most other forms of #investment, but at a higher risk. Commodities trade on different #markets than typical #stocks.
220 2018-04-01 19:14:54 Commodities is food to normal folk that don’t have their head stuck up their #brexit arse. U.K. imports 60% of its food and most of that comes from EU. What #brexit idiots did to the pound makes us all poorer by about 20%
221 2018-04-01 19:10:06 Commodities, you are absolutely clueless.  You should probably just delete your account because you are making yourself look absolutely ridiculous. 
222 2018-04-01 19:07:22 Ever asked why commodities are a risky proposition?
Cause they trade on futures markets which offer a high degree of leverage. A commodity trader normally only has to post 5% to 15% of the contract value in futures margin value to control an investment in the total contract value
223 2018-04-01 19:02:34 At first I was real uneasy about this whole thing, considering what horse racing is, and making girls into racehorses is vaguely... Eeek! But... It looks like they know exactly what they're doing. Gacha idols. 10/10 execution for your gambling commodities.
224 2018-04-01 18:57:42 @BeWithRG Please highlight rising petrol and diesel prices, price rise of common commodities, corruption of executive, Modi and his failure of economic, BJP not the sole flag bearer of Hindu sentiment
225 2018-04-01 18:48:35 Why are the petrol prices rising so often what is the catch prices of commodities going up too why are you torturing people
226 2018-04-01 18:41:18 Never traded commodities. I guess parallel thoughts happen. I saw one about becoming a millionaire from divorce haha.
227 2018-04-01 18:31:26 I guess you have experience in trading commodities? That one sounds familiar.
228 2018-04-01 18:27:05 They will figure out what the anti union corporatists have known for 125 years. "Labor",as opposed to commodities, needs to eat and take care of their children. It kind of improves ownership's bargaining position.
229 2018-04-01 18:17:46 I can see that. I have an old paper written for Nancy Fraser comparing their understanding of commodities. I should dig it it up and see if there's anything still worthwhile in there.
230 2018-04-01 18:05:42 He thinks Marxs framework is too apolitical while f commodities are assertion of political over economic considerations
231 2018-04-01 18:04:57 I'll send you my new paper. Key thing is fictitious commodities are tied to different non market forms of economic integration
232 2018-04-01 18:01:42 Not saying that Marx is definitive on this, of course. But I can't get over the sense there is something partial and undertheorized in how Polanyi analytically distinguishes these fictitious commodities while they are probably more mutually entwined.
233 2018-04-01 18:00:17 Forex and CFDs SUN & MON hours,

Forex opens SUN PM regular hours

234 2018-04-01 17:57:28 I'm far from an expert on this, but what do you make of the category of fictitious commodities - land, labor, and money? It seems like a concept that has no meaning outside of the "capitalism is against human relations" framework of the book.
235 2018-04-01 17:50:04 Lazar the maroon unionised commodities trader
236 2018-04-01 17:46:30 It seems allegorical to the decline in quality of material commodities, ie modern flat pack furniture or $/£ store tools. Standards of workmanship decline with the cost of production in inverse proportion to the private profits extracted.
237 2018-04-01 17:39:57 @TheChinaHustle I am legitimately starting to worry. Just talked to an american who currently works in  commodities from Texas with a background in financial #fraude. He had no idea what a reverse-merger is, and works directly with #China.
238 2018-04-01 17:39:22 What is wrong in telling so?? Do you think the Prices are more in 2018 ?? Please compare all the other commodities along with Petrol prices with MMS and NaMo period.
239 2018-04-01 17:33:47 Compare gas cylinder and other commodities price also. Don't select for convenience sake
240 2018-04-01 17:24:08 El % de la economía en este momento es menos dependiente de commodities q hace unos años, lo q debe promover @petrogustavo no es eliminación de un momento a otro de ellos si no apoyar más la industria y agroindustria para incrementar exportaciones de productos con valor agregado
241 2018-04-01 17:23:11 China can’t hurt us on trade. Most all we sell to them are world mkt commodities . They will sell into any mkt.

243 2018-04-01 17:10:23 I see your point that carbon pricing affects other commodities differently, ie. natural gas vs clothing but don't see why that eliminates it from being called a sales tax.  The aversion to calling it a sales tax seems politically based by our Govt.
244 2018-04-01 17:09:41 Just wait until your kid gets into the commodities markets of gaming where in-game items can be traded and sold for actual money. Values fluctuate based on supply & demand just like the stock market!
245 2018-04-01 17:06:18 I agree. The bright line is clear but the difference between tax on carbon and tax on other commodities is slicing things very thinly! Not sure why that distinction is worth noting.

249 2018-04-01 16:31:10 part 14 Congress should back our money with gold, silver, other commodities, Federal Government owned lands, etc.  Article 1, Section 8 Constitution the power to coin money and regulate value belongs solely to Congress.

250 2018-04-01 16:19:38 Mr President,  please don’t sacrifice the farming community that has and continues to support you.  NAFTA is very important to U.S. Agriculture in this time of lower prices for farm commodities!

256 2018-04-01 15:36:25 Many pundits / strategists have forecasted runaway inflation since 2009 when Fed first did QE. It may come in Q2-Q4. However, let's look at facts not guesses.

273 2018-04-01 13:34:37 @narendramodi PM Sir, why don't you order to kill us. Today the fule rate has gone up drastically. This will result burden to people, because all the commodities will be costly. U all get good food in your canteen at cheap rate. But what we can do???
274 2018-04-01 13:34:31 Govt. spending has increased ... lower inflation is good for essential commodities and common man. Investments are increasing thanks to Make in India. Please learn your economics properly before asking these questions.
275 2018-04-01 13:26:06 .Indian economy is better. Everyday commodities are more or less the same. Veg, meat, dairy products are the same price. However their currency is stable & their economy is on the move. The reason is consistency in policies due to democracy & states' autonomy.
276 2018-04-01 13:02:41 Kinda like all paper n commodities huh
277 2018-04-01 12:54:56 Oh man, it doesn't India is worse. It means India has more CPI inflation than Pakistan. More inflation translates to more demand. India's purchasing power due to a touch more per capita income makes the price of commodities more or less same! Don't fall in binaries.
278 2018-04-01 12:54:08 So , the prices of diseased and petrol r soaring high into the sky at all time record high, what this govt is upto. Must lower down excise duty urgently or it would result in huge price rise of all commodities in the market

294 2018-04-01 10:06:48 But there has never been a time a game like this *could* be made with any sort of confidence in commercial viability. We still need to turn more parts of game production into commodities (like UE4, Unity, etc have done with engines) for that to be possible, I think.

362 2018-03-30 22:53:19 You just described the concept of fetishism of commodities. Individualizing is not effective because it would lead to fragmentation, but it's necessary to acknowledge that there are multiple groups with different needs. And certainly something as simple as workers vs.

397 2018-03-30 18:03:43 Agreed. As markets become more liquid - I do think Bitcoin will become the best store of value. This is a gradual process. Volatility will always be there because there is no supply response with BTC as we see with other commodities- but to a lesser degree.
398 2018-03-30 18:01:05 Disagree here , Brown  encouraged the G20 09 #failedfiscalstimulus the resulting damage to prices like commodities ,bubbling up, dragged growth for years and public debt overhang is a reason why CBs won't/can't exit #ZIRP .

400 2018-03-30 17:49:20 I think the bigger issue may be: most of these relievers are unproven. They pitched well with 0 pressure last year once the season was essentially over. That’s not the same as being proven commodities.
401 2018-03-30 17:39:15 "Is inflation good?" - You, 8:33 A.M.

Or do you think the prices of commodities and debt aren't relevant to answering that question?

Every time you tweet I'm more concerned about the people who decided to give you your job
402 2018-03-30 17:35:22 Thanks for enlightening me, "terrible human." Wish I'd asked if inflation can provide effective discounts on existing debt & commodities.

404 2018-03-30 17:14:41 Personally, I am tired of the un ending and over hyped liberation contributions.  We are so poor bcz of this.We are trapped in the past.  We need to move on.  We have issues to solve now.  Unemployment is high.  No money in banks and expensive basic commodities.
405 2018-03-30 17:10:34 You have to have a part inside you made of  humility and healthy shame. They don't sell those commodities on the internet.
406 2018-03-30 17:07:46 What about Fulani herdsmen killing in the country, is it  not an achievement  ? And increase in the price of commodities.
407 2018-03-30 16:50:17 I think it’s partly the recent homogenization of society that has focused on materialism rather than community values. People become expendable and treat each other like commodities, as opposed to real human beings.

414 2018-03-30 16:03:46 Exportamos petróleo en crudo, bananos en racimos, café en pepitas, flores sin transformación, aguacate en fruta, oro en lingote. El problema no es q es más importante, si petróleo o aguacate. El problema es que solo exportamos commodities. Somos un país extractivo, y en bruto...
415 2018-03-30 15:58:42 Although developing countries are sources of commodities used by West they face trade deficits, because West controls prices ensuring very low prices of raw materials and highly inflated prices of finished goods produced with these raw materials.
416 2018-03-30 15:54:24 Reminds me of a joke you made 10 years ago: in Zimbabwe, it’s always a bull market in commodities.

418 2018-03-30 15:18:06 yes, its only theft (in video games) if commodities are made artificially scarce, either through loot box-like mechanisms or digitally scarce like cryptocurrencies.
419 2018-03-30 15:16:30 1. Principales economías del mundo, pese a los anuncios, siguen dependientes de los Commodities de origen fósil, son importantes para la productividad y poderío económico.

420 2018-03-30 15:13:49 @Varneyco Do not like that running oil, gold, and silver prices have been replaced with Global Dow and Nikkei. Add another box for commodities or go back to the original format.

422 2018-03-30 15:01:41 Rare commodities are worth more than good
423 2018-03-30 14:58:23 i dont think Debord (specifically) argued that it was forced by capitalism. His thesis was that a society of material abundance created a cycle that would go from a desire to satisfy needs to a society that _desires to appear_ (to have commodities)
424 2018-03-30 14:46:01 Ah, but vigilance, morality and discipline are unknown commodities in our decadent age, so let's eat, drink, and be merry - for tomorrow we die (in our debtors' prisons).
425 2018-03-30 14:45:42 
Capitalism also sees no value in commodities which are free and in unlimited supply - like smiles and compliments - so they are scarce in our world, giving them more and more value every year!

Confidence & inner beauty are also free, and each of us control their source

439 2018-03-30 13:15:53 Human beings are not commodities, instruments, or objects. Human beings are not subjects for examination. This kind of impersonalization is the fundamental mode of devaluing humans. The resulting expectations have molded entire generations to be less than what they can be!

476 2018-03-30 06:01:49 Slavery is a perfect example of how one class diminishes the value of another class of people.  The capitalists made humans commodities, openly bid on them, for personal gain, approved of by the class (capitalist class) they chose to emulate. Racism is a capitalists tool.
477 2018-03-30 05:53:55 The problem we find at the intersection of capitalism and social media is that pieces of us become commodities and we unconsciously learn to consume one other.
478 2018-03-30 05:40:57 You can point to regulation and tax season as driving the crypto selloff, but over-saturation and over-excitement in any market (from apps to commodities to fidget spinners) ultimately leads to a big crash and repurposed priorities. Weak links go. This is exciting.

491 2018-03-30 02:56:14 Those are perfectly reasonable commodities on which to spend one’s riches.
492 2018-03-30 02:30:06 The writer should explore more about why the barriers are coming up and focus on improving quality of commodities rather than blaming importing countries for having stringent norms.
493 2018-03-30 02:29:01 That browsers right now are interchangeable commodities in the mobile space, so integration plays (hardware, Chinese government support, etc.) are pretty much the only thing that drive adoption.
494 2018-03-30 02:27:33 Its due to them borrowing to invest in OBOR projects aka Silk Road.  They have a triangular trade framework with Oil Yuan and physical Gold.  This is building confidence.  They may well go to Gold backed commodity trading on many other commodities outside just oil.

Crypto - Market dips. Dip mightn't be finished yet but there could be a lesson in it. ETH is $400, 30% of hi.  Pay the right market price and don't go chasing seller discounts.

501 2018-03-30 01:25:17 For money, if you can dedicate the create an actual trade market that is malleable. Something that changes as the world around it does. War in Vespigg? Simple commodities are harder to comeby, luxuries are rare and finding a buyer for that +4 meridonite battle axe will be harder.

504 2018-03-30 01:14:16 From my journal March 2000

My friend and commodities trading associate took his own life. I hesitate to include a memorial for him here, yet it was a deeply significant loss to me personally, and a profound lesson about the extreme dangers of trading. I miss him often.

Solo aguacate: @petrogustavo.

Lo racional: petróleo Y agucate Y muchos otros productos, sean commodities donde tengamos potencial o de valor agregado.

507 2018-03-30 00:51:30 It’s not so much the act of being milked that causes pain or harm, but it’s the circumstances surrounding it. It really is a horrible industry that treats them like economic commodities rather than living animals.

510 2018-03-30 00:07:40 @CNBCFastMoney Pleeeeeease stop putting @fundstrat on your show or talking about Bitcoin. It's a stupid magical internet currency that happened to spike and now it's over and done with. Talk more about energy or other commodities or emerging markets instead.
