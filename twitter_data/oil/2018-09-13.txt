7 2018-09-13 23:59:22 Dear Eric, I think that China knows very well where they're investing they money, because they knows that the Regime will not be able to honor the debt and they know that the guarantee of that debt is a Deposit of Crude Oil to be exploited and it is part of our National patrimony
8 2018-09-13 23:59:19 I'm an artist, and I think you did amazing! You hit the nail on the head: "it's not about skill, it's about the joy of painting." You should be really happy with how your piece came out! Oil paints are not easy to use. And following someone else adds another challenge. Bravo!

12 2018-09-13 23:58:26 We are safe in @andoverma -- luckily we have oil.  Thanks to everyone who offered their houses to my family.  Nice to know we have that many people looking out.
13 2018-09-13 23:58:14 If you oppose relations with Cuba because of their human rights record even when having relations would help businesses, then I suppose you’d also oppose relations with Saudi Arabia (a nation with atrocious human rights violations) even if cutting relations would hurt big oil?
14 2018-09-13 23:58:02 See Igbos are mad rich but never show it. I learnt mist of the houses in Lekki then belonged to Ojukwu's dad who was a Palm Oil merchant and he recovered it from the government after the Biafra war
15 2018-09-13 23:57:48 What a disgusting sight. It’s a time when every penny must be spent on undoing damage caused by a hundred years of coal and oil pollution, of the need to think solutions solving basic problems among the world’s people so we can have basics; food/water/shelter. Not impossible.

39 2018-09-13 23:57:16 So what I been waiting here for? A free inspection for what? You didn’t do the damn oil change fools and ya can’t even apologize for it. Fools thinking cause im female that you think im dumb.
40 2018-09-13 23:57:09 Khamenei/IRGC know what to do, they just don't want to, they get US dollars for the crude oil sales, arrange for the UN to setup an oil for medicine and food arrangement, since it's dollars the Iran inflation thing won't be part of it, the oil can sell, for med's and food
41 2018-09-13 23:57:06 Or does he? 
42 2018-09-13 23:56:55 Hey all, for those of you who take CBD oil, is there one you recommend?
43 2018-09-13 23:56:44 No. Oil and gas.
44 2018-09-13 23:56:39 i'm in nj.. always used oil... afraid of exploding gas.. doesn't happen a lot, but it happens... i just put in gas heat a couple months ago..  this is scary..
45 2018-09-13 23:56:32 Agree, more Russians in UK than we have armed forces, billions in mafia laundered money. Oligarchs by the dozen and don't forget the threat of cutting oil and gas supplies.
46 2018-09-13 23:56:09 My hair smells like a mixture of the boy I’m sleeping with and my amazing avocado hair oil and I don’t know how to feel about this
47 2018-09-13 23:55:58 Boy George clearly doesn’t have good taste.
48 2018-09-13 23:55:42 Get a man na "pagod lang ako, pero hindi to yung dahilan para sukuan kita" rap non sa ears! Sana oil
49 2018-09-13 23:55:34 I usually press/dry and then pan fry with a little oil
50 2018-09-13 23:55:34 Why dafreak should I pay someone to change my engine oil and brake fluid when I can do it myself?
51 2018-09-13 23:55:24 And I just tossed out my oil pastels 2 weeks ago 
52 2018-09-13 23:55:23 Clark and Sebastian didn’t like the oil company’s because of what they were doing to the environment and all the story’s they heard. Like when the farmer had the oil pipe exploded, the farmer went to jail because the oil company’s were bribing the police.

54 2018-09-13 23:54:58 That's what happened...As per @dpradhanbjp we paid Rs 70,000 cr of interests on the Oil Bonds which has been prepaid by Modi Govt by charging higher Excise Duty....Until we treat Petrol / Diesel as Luxury, India can't innovate solar power vehicles
55 2018-09-13 23:54:50 Going to scrap cap on oil I put in my car engine too, since apparently it makes no difference to performance of the engine! #Abbot
56 2018-09-13 23:54:28 u wanna know the most satisfying thong ever its when u have 2 different hues of black/grey oil paint youve mixed and you make a stroke with both and they blend and have almost the full chromatic scale within the same value of BLACK phew
57 2018-09-13 23:54:28 Caldara himself said he is not ready, but Rahman from the oil fields of Soodi demands #WeWantCaldara.
58 2018-09-13 23:54:28 The money cartel was bailing out the politicians they own over in Iran - we also know that cash could've been necessary to help with modernization of Iran's old oil systems. The third possibility means there is a war being set up.
59 2018-09-13 23:54:23 Got my oil changed and tires rotated today. Picked up my car afterwards and the check engine light is on.  just my luck.
60 2018-09-13 23:54:20 Change oil light whyyyyyyyyy
61 2018-09-13 23:53:58 Fine. Republicans won’t get any either. You sure you want to play that game?
62 2018-09-13 23:53:55 Definitely sus. Probably paid big oil shill..
63 2018-09-13 23:53:55 So did your orange slob and and so did both Bushes America has been eating Saudi sh*t for eons and all for oil, even after their citizens all 19 of them perpetrated 9/11
64 2018-09-13 23:53:42 Oya someone bring me some anointing oil for this boy right here
65 2018-09-13 23:53:39 I don’t like people who can’t admit their mistakes. Fool how are you gonna tell me I had my oil change last month? Explain how 5 quarts of oil is gone in less than a month then?
66 2018-09-13 23:53:34 That’s what happens when you’ve got oil money over flowing
67 2018-09-13 23:53:16 this is a false equivalency. a mechanic doesn't buy all the consumables that the shop uses, oil, fluids, brake pads, etc. that's a more apt comparison.

79 2018-09-13 23:50:56 Why did he get suspended?
80 2018-09-13 23:50:48 Watch out for oil slicks Tucker ...
81 2018-09-13 23:50:43 Thanks for reaching out, Adam. We don’t allow sellers to list CBD oil and are continuously monitoring the site to remove any listings. With millions of new listings added daily, this is always an ongoing process. ~Lindsey
82 2018-09-13 23:50:28 We are going to need conventional fuels for at least the next 20 years.
Even if we stop burning oil tomorrow, the rest of the world won't, and why we need this pipeline to get access to markets that will pay the most for our oil.
83 2018-09-13 23:49:57 Yes, PRIORITY - END *ALL* U.S. imperialist/regime-change/NWO wars PRONTO! No soldiers dying for Israel, oil, or your satanic global agenda! We do not consent to endless warfare against nebulous, counterfeit enemies! Thank you!!!
84 2018-09-13 23:49:51 I spent this morning looking for my joint that was in the pocket of the jacket I wore out of the house so I put it in my car since I wore my jacket to work and these guys just changed my oil and we’re in my car with my joint just chilling there waiting for me
85 2018-09-13 23:49:51 Oil spill cranium? Get it! Looks gorg!
86 2018-09-13 23:49:44 Or was it for calling him Bradley?

91 2018-09-13 23:49:17 so our PP and PK sucked last year ,oh ya ,so did our goaltending hmm ..that doesn't mean our whole Org sucks ,just means that last years team did slightly and that Manny and our other new coaches have there work cut out this year ,I'm getting tired we need more Coffee :) go Oil
92 2018-09-13 23:49:12 Where is a sterilizing oil slick when you need it?
93 2018-09-13 23:48:47 Democrats can suck as much of my dick as Republicans can. You corporatist cunts are the reason these religious nut jobs continue to stay in power because you greedy little parasites work for lobbyists instead of your constituents! Beholden to big pharma and oil not America
94 2018-09-13 23:48:37 Lol ok, but back in reality libertarians are all bankrolled by massive oil and gas corps that want to be free to make money destroying the planet without paying for the consequences, while leftists advocate for the oppressed.
95 2018-09-13 23:48:31 He is a traitor.

99 2018-09-13 23:48:16 USA becomes top oil producer, Median income rises to all time high #winning #MAGA
100 2018-09-13 23:47:47 So I'm using this scrub, its amazing. Coconut oil 
Coffee
Cinnamon 
Brown sugar 
That shit will soften your skin, I'm most likely late to this life kodwa ke bengisho that's all
101 2018-09-13 23:47:31 Quisiera que fuera cierto. Pero el comentario de Romo sobre los contratos de PEMEX, contradicen muchos "argumentos". Respetar esos contratos es aceptar la entrega de la soberanía nacional a extranjeros, y lo PEOR aún, que Salinas, enemigo de AMLO, sea más rico con Sierra Oil.
102 2018-09-13 23:47:24 Yes! Seasoned almond flour, egg, then shredded coconut & crushed porkrinds (I find them nasty but you don’t taste them & they make them crispy). Sautéed in coconut oil.
103 2018-09-13 23:47:17 Almond oil smells good 

Why did I think it’s smell would be similar to neem 
104 2018-09-13 23:47:13 the more you wash your hair, the more it strips your oil which causes your scalp to produce more oil bc you keep washing it out. i wash mine every other day and that keeps it nice and healthy :)
105 2018-09-13 23:47:07 FBI says there is no issue. Buh bye Dianne.
106 2018-09-13 23:47:02 Crazy...they are now talking about 700 miles of gas lines being replaced thru out MA and this could have been caused by lines being replaced in Lawrence area. Glad I have oil also .
107 2018-09-13 23:47:00 The Eagle Ford Shale is greatly contributing to the oil boom in America!
108 2018-09-13 23:46:58 I dont think the government care about the region there bombing, they just see friendly arab oil drillers investing in britain. Business isnt clean mate, especially football
109 2018-09-13 23:46:53 Airlines are a great example, but they more came out of forever zombie land. I’m still waiting for oil/energy stocks to have a revival after being left for dead...that’ll hopefully be my answer in a year.
110 2018-09-13 23:46:50 You’re failing to acknowledge the full scope of climate change. Some areas will get greener as others dry up (duh). Ocean level is vulnerable to feedback mechanisms which will make rising sea level happen faster and faster. And clearly Palm oil doesn’t negate ocean acidification

114 2018-09-13 23:46:25 Pretty boys will use all your hair products, coconut oil, bath & body works. Nah, I’m good with a regular degular.
115 2018-09-13 23:46:00 If Palm oil or anything like it is in the products you buy, you are contributing to the destruction of Sumatra. No Palm Oil Products. Stop buying them, they are in everything.
116 2018-09-13 23:45:55 I don't understand why I get so many gas/oil company ads. I don't drive! I take the bus! 
117 2018-09-13 23:45:54 I really got a boy mad at me for going and getting my oil changed professionally instead of letting him do it wtf
118 2018-09-13 23:45:48 looool they're putting on jackets and shit because they're afraid to get splashed with hot oil from the deep fryer. i'm crying.
119 2018-09-13 23:45:42 Marajuana oil,works a treat.
120 2018-09-13 23:45:42 Things that make me happy about my car... Oil Change  Full Tank  Car Washed 
121 2018-09-13 23:45:37 As Naomi Klein has expressed, we privatize business gains, and socialize the losses.  Our oil, big ag, pharma and banking industries along with Wal Mart and Amazon with their workers on food stamps & subsidized housing, reap massive socialist benefits via subsidies and bailouts.
122 2018-09-13 23:45:36 Let me get a jerk chicken on white bread, lettuce tomato chipotle mayo banana peppers green peppers salt pepper oil vinegar, send that shit to RI
123 2018-09-13 23:45:30 You and wholesome?? That’s water and oil mixed together
124 2018-09-13 23:45:27 Lol. Nope the semis aren't even close to getting the necessary range. We are naturally decreasing our carbon emissions through invention. Coal to oil to electricity for example. What we are doing now is attempting to force tech. when its not ready yet.
125 2018-09-13 23:44:55 Pick me up some tea tree oil!!!
126 2018-09-13 23:44:31 When life hands you lemons...

128 2018-09-13 23:44:09 the whole reason I became a photographer was to travel and be involved in multiple things. Don’t shit on me achieving my dreams & making bank & getting a college degree bc u probably work in an oil field or construction or some shit
129 2018-09-13 23:43:53 Oh you crazy  RT @Purrriss: I’m getting a tire rotation and an oil change tomorrow. Only 6 months past the date on the lil sticker.
130 2018-09-13 23:43:49 Go oil
131 2018-09-13 23:42:47 Another brainwashed kook, I wonder how much he got paid to bleat that garbage. How much do you get paid to block Canadian oil mike?
132 2018-09-13 23:42:42 my boyfriend loves cooking, and he freaking LOVES this store.  I now am reminded I need to get him more garlic grapeseed oil or olive oil or whatever the weird thing is he likes to cook with.
133 2018-09-13 23:42:39 fuck, i look at one martha stewart living magazine and i want black basalt pottery and some $72 facial oil
134 2018-09-13 23:42:38 Imagine proudly graduating with your marketing degree but only being able to find a job for Big Oil... at least that's what I imagine. Wouldn't most people pick pretty much any company over Exxon or Conoco?
135 2018-09-13 23:42:27 By way of reminder, the oil industry itself caused the supply glut that is the cause of discounts in a oversupplied NA market. Yes, Canada's producers need access to non-US markets. However, capex will prefer the in-and-out of shale over long-term mega-projects.
136 2018-09-13 23:42:23 @srd_oil

137 2018-09-13 23:42:19 Sesame oil is the answer to everything. Chicken tastes off? Fry it in some sesame oil. Salad dressing needs a kick? Mix in some sesame oil. Life falling apart? Drizzle some sesame oil on your head and cry.
138 2018-09-13 23:42:11 Coffee,coconut oil,sugar. 
139 2018-09-13 23:41:44 Doesn’t it have electricity? I’ve got an oil radiator that’s great for heating a room. Better than one of those fire hazard heaters.
140 2018-09-13 23:41:26 I'm no oil painting, but Wow! is she ever ugly!
141 2018-09-13 23:41:24 so what about the oil made from long-dead animals? @LeilaniMunter

Gary V is the best legit marketer of digital age.
146 2018-09-13 23:40:54 I hate that slimy jet oil haired POS. And I DO believe DT should be held accountable for using the presidency against a civilian citizen’s right to make a living in this country.
147 2018-09-13 23:40:49 No amount of so called clean energy ( it's not as it takes enormous resources to make solar panels and windmills)  can replace oil and gas.  You want to live in a primitive manner, be my guest, but don't expect others to live your fantasy
148 2018-09-13 23:40:18 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。

170 2018-09-13 23:37:34 Think logically about the Earth, about nature..

181 2018-09-13 23:35:52 Oh yes, 300 years ago, founders of the most important Port City in the United States should have anticipated the poor planning and engineering of the levees along the Mississippi River, predicted sediment compaction due to water extraction, oil drilling and human errors.

188 2018-09-13 23:34:33 And the whole “hypocrisy!” argument gets very tiresome for anyone who’s worked in environmentalism, like me, who has to deal with oil-loving trolls who think it’s clever to point out I’m writing on a computer made of oil products. Shall I switch to smoke signals, or yodelling?
189 2018-09-13 23:34:25 uh, greening is opposite of "dessertification", all-time record food production not shortages, oceans have been rising for 20000 years; green policies e.g. using palm oil as fuel have damaged biodiversity.

233 2018-09-13 23:28:59 Ah yes - the climate denier.  You keep towing the line of the GOP and Oil and Gas Companies.  They clearly don't have any conflicting interests in the matter.  

Why don't you pick up a book and form your own conclusions, instead of parroting climate denier talking points?

238 2018-09-13 23:28:25 Is that what they have in that area? When I lived there, most rural places used oil. I don't think of Andover as rural (compared to further west). 

Out here we have natural gas. Didn't help San Bruno. And you know of the PG&E *fire* connection (Sonoma/Napa October last year).
239 2018-09-13 23:28:20 My Pops always said that it tastes good because they don’t change the oil frequently.

247 2018-09-13 23:27:29 Also just FYI. There were 2 oil embargo instituted by OPEC, not Iran. One in ‘73, one in ‘79. There was inflation before that but we dummies who were studying it at the time were attributing the inflation more to an increase in the money supply. Nixon even tried price freezes.

264 2018-09-13 23:25:28 President Trump to you.  Pres. Trump has been a more positive effective than Insane Obama.  When there was an oil leak in the Gulf, Obama talked to the officials for 20 minutes.  That's laziness on Obama.  So, spin it all you want, pictures, videos & results don't lie.  YOU LIE!!

266 2018-09-13 23:25:21 Give me a break. Ted Cruz sided with a Canadian corporation when they were seizing property from Texans for an oil pipeline, and he supports the border wall, which would require seizure of hundreds of acres from landowners in Texas.
267 2018-09-13 23:25:12 Thanks for assuming I don't work hard, living in the heart of the oil and gas industry in northern AB as I do.

277 2018-09-13 23:23:38 He's 18. Patchouli is a distinctive smell - if you have a hippy shop near you, you could pop in for a sniff. It has to be the actual oil though, not candles or joss sticks. I still actually like it (nostalgia) it used to be said that people wore it to hide the smell of marijuana.

289 2018-09-13 23:20:50 They really wanted the 35% cap lifted last time, they wouldn't have been announcing it with such glee prematurely otherwise.  So expect to see - if you must eat a " high fat diet" - make it "our high fat " hence the recent coconut oil announcement.
290 2018-09-13 23:20:21 The cure for cancer already exists, but they are not about let that billion dollar business go. CBD oil has done miracles for many cancer patients
291 2018-09-13 23:20:10 Sad.

304 2018-09-13 23:18:27 LMAO yeah several of his followers blocked me cause I said olive oil and pistacchios are healthy even if I endorse a meat-based diet.

They are as extremist as vegans....

Wait: FUN FACT, I know a couple of vegans that switched to carnivore diet. LMAO extreme personalities....

307 2018-09-13 23:17:48 I just broke through a old Heavy Hitters cart that still had some canna oil in it. I dabbed that shit just to get high. Is that wrong lol?
308 2018-09-13 23:17:32 "Oligarchs"  or oil tycoons, that piece is as old as the hills in Russiagate Conspiracy Theory time.

311 2018-09-13 23:16:57 Shell oil at that time was, on my reading of the evidence, complicit in murder to advance its commercial interests. That’s just a fact. Doesn’t make every Shell employee a murderer . And it was not an isolated event
312 2018-09-13 23:16:56 GG4 Brass Knuckles is something SERIOUS. Best oil I've had so far but I wonder if there is a Holy Grail Kush version out there.
313 2018-09-13 23:16:53 @MDLZ Hey Kraft Foods, my wife is trying your Oreo hand snacks...not good. I can't have them due to gluten but I can have the frosting. It's horrible. Too much oil. Thought you'd like some feedback. And don't change your name when everyone hates your brand.
314 2018-09-13 23:16:38 I’ve been ordering this oil for years from Sephora until they stopped carrying it. I’ll be trying my luck at Neiman Marcus next. 
315 2018-09-13 23:16:03 We've got a couple oil refineries within 15-20 miles from here and up north in Cleveland.  Very happy when I drive by and see smoke coming out of them.  If not, kaboom.

317 2018-09-13 23:15:35 Yeah, so US and NATO can leave it broken, destitute and corrupt like they did Libya.... But the oil flows and the people struggle... This is terrorism...

320 2018-09-13 23:15:01 1/ It began in 1970s - Hayek and Friedman put us on a terrible path in the midst of the oil shock, that came to its zenith at the credit crisis. Generations have suffered and mass imbalances in trade created. It’s a fucking disgrace. If you wish to learn more....
321 2018-09-13 23:15:01 I was proud of myself for going to bed early. Fast forward an hour and a half and I wake up with a violent allergic reaction to spouse’s new fancy Italian shaving Creme. Took four different meds but will be awake until they kick in. Who is allergic to citrus oil? This loser.

331 2018-09-13 23:13:08 I’ve only used olive oil in my hair for the past few weeks. Felt like the leave ins were drying me out. Gonna mix with black Jamaican castor oil tonight w a rod set & see how that goes
332 2018-09-13 23:13:00 Didn't like the black castor oil Shea moisture leave in but I got another free sample and used it again and I like it.
333 2018-09-13 23:12:56 David Suzuki flies to all his speech venues. Buying carbon offsets is just a shell game as is restricting Canadian oil supply. Other countries will just fill the gap. Write a letter to stop coal shipments from BC! Work on reducing carbon demand.
334 2018-09-13 23:12:26 I hate getting my oil changed

345 2018-09-13 23:09:45 $70USD, +25% exch. Less $35 land lock discount. $52.50/bbl CDN to Canadian producers.  Most companies can’t drill and extract oil at that price. Much less explore or mine.
346 2018-09-13 23:09:43 South East would've benefited so much if Christians had adopted Red oil as Anointing oil thereby promoting local content. But No! "awa God" loves Oyibo things so he preferred Goya oil made in USA. We despise ours to please theirs.

348 2018-09-13 23:09:26 Perhaps you should read the book. Because in it Taft points out that every political party has been 'captured' by the oil and gas industry. What's more, so have the universities and many other key institutions like the media that are the pillars of democracy. It is compelling.

385 2018-09-13 23:03:19 We are not ready to switch over to clean energy 100%. In the meantime big oil companies are investing a lot of research dollars into clean energy.

You can’t pretend like you care about #NationalParks when your donors are buying you off so that you’ll let them poison the environment. #WeSeeYOU
434 2018-09-13 22:57:39 I do love my whirlypop, even without coconut oil (Hubby's allergic.). Also excellent for making kettle corn, which I might do right now.

436 2018-09-13 22:57:32 It’s a dave Chappell skit where he was “Black bush” & the lady was asking him about “oil” . It’s funny af

438 2018-09-13 22:57:15 I like the smell of petrol, gas and motor oil
439 2018-09-13 22:57:05 You probably didn’t hear this on @CNN this week, but America became the world’s largest oil producer and middle-class income is now at an all-time high.

That’s what you call Making America Great Again

442 2018-09-13 22:56:37 I saw him in the liquids aisle looking at oil and he asks me “hey dude, when he said five-fifty, did he mean 5w-50?”

Bruh, you’re 40.
443 2018-09-13 22:56:31 I just realized oil makes me creative, @asvpxrocky is yelling it on testing
444 2018-09-13 22:56:28 If the Oil start winning and have some fun while doing it I wanna spect to see more smiling.
445 2018-09-13 22:56:11 Facts, I used to dream to be apart of Space X. Ended up talking to employees and they talked me out of it lol. I honestly like that the Gas/Oil giants are leading the pack with biofuel. It’s like good karma
446 2018-09-13 22:56:03 I teach yoga and mindfulness to my students. I have a few who I have helped with natural deodorant and parents ask about essential oil use at school. It helps that I have a naturopath on the school board.
447 2018-09-13 22:55:56 I’m so impressed at being able to change my own tires & oil  get up under that car & get dirty. Idgaf

-Ya just pop the hood

"Is there a guy who can help"

-Dude, you just came in asking a girl to check yo shit. You're in no position to ask for a MALE when you are a male yourself. 

"Oh you right"
456 2018-09-13 22:54:27 he is SO CONVINCING about cbd oil. literally the only reason i have ever considered trying it

460 2018-09-13 22:53:59 By a weird coincidence, I inquired today at my local fuel oil company about the possibility of converting my house to gas heat. Of course we don't have piped gas up here, it would be a propane pig out behind my house, but still. Eerie.
461 2018-09-13 22:53:51 your body is an oil lamp
462 2018-09-13 22:53:46 This islamist has no idea of oil world trade which today traded 91.10$, its  state tax imposed around 26 to 29 rs that causes higher price, put in GST will reduce but few want it as the states milk it. Coconut oil of 45 gone Rs 210, alcholol which cost 200 is taxed 280 but no cry
463 2018-09-13 22:53:43 Judging by his demeanor and his outfit, I can assume he’s pretty well to do (this is also in Eagle Rock) and he goes “yeah... um, I have Saab.... 2006.... and I need some oil for it.” DUDE, are you KIDDING ME?!
464 2018-09-13 22:53:19 My oil paint is still wet. Why do people work with them. Wtf they never dryyyyy ugh

466 2018-09-13 22:53:04 That shit gonna rocket the oil price
467 2018-09-13 22:52:47 Does that include weekends when he gets an invite to micheal Barrymores intensive swimming lessons? And tells the wife hes only going for 1 then ends up in kev websters kitchen doing pie charts on what percentage of oil he puts into a penny farthing
468 2018-09-13 22:52:44 Ahhh... isn't Germany the one taking Russian oil money?? And didn't Trump lecture them about it?? If you're gonna make wild claims at least have SOME basis in reality
469 2018-09-13 22:52:41 No not good. Not good is how you are over turning everything to save the planet while oil coal and greedy CEO’s who you are taking care of are making money while killing the planet. But ok when the planets gone no matter how money there make will save them or you  idiot
470 2018-09-13 22:52:40 The cold war never ended, today vzla, the country with the largest oil reserves receives orders from Russia and China. live in socialism and understand that it is bad.

496 2018-09-13 22:48:35 Basically CBD Oil is Big Pharma And only they really know whats in it, a little glysophate, probably.......... And it is only 5 or 10 percent for that money Sincerely you would have much more powerful medicine if you grow the plant yourself and juice the whole plant or tincture
497 2018-09-13 22:48:24 Weird thing about Boston is that it's one of the last areas to still largely use oil instead of natural gas to heat homes.

Doesn't seem like that's going to be changing any time soon...

Upside for the moment though: it may mean relatively fewer gas customers than other places?

500 2018-09-13 22:47:50 too much salt & oil. gimmie my hotpot :c
501 2018-09-13 22:47:44 I think that's a little unfair. We should be measuring relative to the lowest carbon barrel of oil - maybe Saudi Crude? You would know better than me. My view is that going beyond that is the domain of creating alternatives on the demand side.
502 2018-09-13 22:47:28 just got my oil changed and it cost me $93..literally nothing makes me feel more taken advantage of than taking my car in.
503 2018-09-13 22:47:27 ...no...it’s either chicken coated in crushed peanuts, or cooked in peanut oil so it’s got a bit of a peanut buttery taste to it. 

It’s delicious.
504 2018-09-13 22:47:20 By oil producers are you referring to our coal being gutted, only to have the SCOTUS check Obama & his illegal activities? I'd be willing to bet you were a Solyndra fan too. I'm grown, name calling means nothing to me.
505 2018-09-13 22:47:15 Among other immune boosters and Antibacterials/Antimicrobials, my favorites would be Colloidal Silver, MMS (in especially small child doses), Korean Ginseng tea, or Ginger Tea-You can cool it down and add some honey and lemon, Flaxseed Oil and cottage (1-4 ratio), Fresh Juices.
506 2018-09-13 22:47:11 Marketing , finding me an audience.  Also I need someone to mow my lawn, run errands, get my oil changed in the family cars... etc
507 2018-09-13 22:47:02 My mother dropped a lumpia in the oil and the bubbling sounded like the AHS theme song to me which probably means I should take a break (I'm but absolutely not going to)
508 2018-09-13 22:46:38 Wonder if it is cyber terrorism.  Many oil/gas pipelines have been intentionally blown up like this in the Middle East with intentional over pressurization.

525 2018-09-13 22:44:34 The biggest drivers of the blue-collar hiring surge are the rebound in oil prices, the need to rebuild after disasters such as Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, and rising demand generated by a growing economy.

534 2018-09-13 22:42:54 Why should I participate when my federal government is buying pipelines and allowing oil sands emissions to *go up* to 100Mt - 20% of a carbon budget that you campaigned on as being *the floor*.  Ontario's emissions are already below 1990 levels

571 2018-09-13 22:38:31 Maybe try a hippie type healer. U never know they might have some herb from the rainforest or something. They might also have snake oil though.
572 2018-09-13 22:38:28 We're happy you've found Clinique, Alli! You've made some excellent choices geared to cleaner and clearer skin. Keep in touch, and let us know how you enjoy your Acne Solutions Oil Control Cleaning Mask for "facial night" tonight!
573 2018-09-13 22:38:28 Simple guac is the best guac: avocado, garlic, cumin, salt, pepper, and a wee bit of olive oil. Fuck cilantro.
574 2018-09-13 22:38:18 Big Oil at in again. Tesla #model3 lower priced version can't come quick enough
575 2018-09-13 22:38:15 It is no coincidence that all "have provinces" have one thing in common and that is an oil and gas sector.
576 2018-09-13 22:38:07 Also, the environmental NGOs, despite what they say, are still creatures of coastal California. And there are big parts of the state that are much more conservative and where Ag and oil are the major private sector employers. CA is a climate hawk state with a major oil industry.
577 2018-09-13 22:37:49 Okay so who can do my oil change? 
578 2018-09-13 22:37:44 I really hate coming for an oil change and they wanna tell me I need something else smh

580 2018-09-13 22:36:49 your earlier chart xle:oil saying oil 'should' pull back...was yesterday and today a 'sizeable' enough pullback? Or, confirms your current bull flag failure and pullback?
581 2018-09-13 22:36:44 All of these oils that I suggest are for topical use, as I have not researched them otherwise. Also, they are to be mixed about 1:1 with a “carrier oil.” 

My go to is:

1) lavender 
2) Black pepper
3) peppermint 
4) marjoram sweet
5) frankincense blends them
582 2018-09-13 22:36:17 Good for her.   I wonder if folks realize that the military and public education are outcomes of the bad word socialism..  some socialism is good.  Roads, military, police, national parks, education, senior protections...  Venezuelan oil, not so much.
583 2018-09-13 22:36:10 I rubbed my stress relief oil on my wrist before work and a customer told me I smell like a plant ...
584 2018-09-13 22:36:02 Standard Oil and the Dutch East India Co were both monstrous compared to those you mentioned.
585 2018-09-13 22:35:47 Too much oil in your petrol
586 2018-09-13 22:35:39 CBD oil is supposed to help as well. It is just so expensive.
587 2018-09-13 22:35:38 Girls tennis defeats Oil City 5-0!!
588 2018-09-13 22:35:37 We still get billions of dollars in tax revenue and royalties from the oil industry to pay for schools hospitals roads. When was the last time Ontario built a school from money generated from wind mill farm?
589 2018-09-13 22:35:36 Oil is moved by rail on all of the tracks around me. They do that too! 
590 2018-09-13 22:35:32 At least that nestle bottle had water inside it... unlike your leader zardari who was having vodka in nestle bottle and was dancing on stage... ppp means pee pee pee honey and zatoon oil bottles who found in memon’s room lol shams on u
591 2018-09-13 22:35:15 Gas, oil and coal subsidies! How much do they provide to our GDP?
592 2018-09-13 22:35:06 Baked sweet potato slices with a touch of avocado oil & gray salt over a bed of *looks at package* "power greens" is pretty damn good. Eating more mindfully has been a delicious turn-of-events.

600 2018-09-13 22:34:42 I don't have a beard, but I think I want this. (Can it be used as hair oil, like after a shower?)
601 2018-09-13 22:34:29 honestly just cleaning ur diet&drowning yourself in water. exercising EVERY day for 60 minutes. get at least 8 hrs of sleep and don’t be on your phone as much. i also have oily skin so using some oil sheets to wipe my face off throughout the day so I don’t touch it either helps.

608 2018-09-13 22:34:12 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

611 2018-09-13 22:33:57 It has not been corrected we are generating more revenue due to commodity prices climbing job numbers are down vompared to when oil prices were previously this high foreign investment has nose dived and gone down south. Private sector jobs also taken a nose dive.
612 2018-09-13 22:33:54 don’t buy it then, it’s a waste if i’m not going to be an amazing lonnelette oil painting

614 2018-09-13 22:33:49 These people have no imagination. Everything has to be a replay or a sequel of a past episode: his Watergate moment, his Katrina moment, etc. It's so boring.
615 2018-09-13 22:33:44 Oil ruins the air so it probably is justifyed
616 2018-09-13 22:33:41 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepared a table before my enemies. You aniont my head with oil; my cup ovrrflows. Psalm23:4-5
617 2018-09-13 22:33:24 And their old boat churns through tonnes of oil on every voyage.
618 2018-09-13 22:33:08 Obama was responsible for the largest environmental disaster in US history. The BP Oil Spill, more than 200 million gallons of crude oil pumped into the Gulf of Mexico for a total of 87 days, while he sat on his butt. Never Forget!

638 2018-09-13 22:31:10 Not necessary.  We don't need the oil (right now). 
But we could use cheaper bananas from Nicaragua.... just sayin'.
639 2018-09-13 22:31:10 I suppose we have ensured the continued supply of oil and global economic growth despite a decade of middle eastern instability.

644 2018-09-13 22:30:45 Direct subsidies are giving them money from tax payers indirect subsidies are more common and not exclusive to the oil industry they are breaks given in taxes and royalties money that we have never collected and something most countries do to attract investment.

710 2018-09-13 22:21:52 Clarke and Sebastian hated the oil companies because the oil was harming the environment and the oil companies took no responsibility for the incident. No we don’t think it was justified. Shania,Te Waikaukau, Nicole, Maia.
711 2018-09-13 22:21:47 I think Clak nd Sebstian hated the oil compnies becausethe oil was a harming environment and the oil companies took no responsibility for the incident, and they hated that

714 2018-09-13 22:21:28 Bungle used harmless anthrax to build the workers immunity to it so that when they attacked the big corporate oil monsters, only they would die and not the workers they were immune to it by then.

715 2018-09-13 22:21:25 Today we use cars, computers, plastics, medicines, etc.—ALL invented by scientists. Yet many Americans think scientists are dead wrong that CO2 causes climate change.

Have 99% of all scientists really turned into lying hacks? Or—do oil companies have reasons to make us think so?
716 2018-09-13 22:21:25 わー！ありがとうございます
717 2018-09-13 22:21:18 Clark and Sebastian hate the oil companies because they are wrecking the earth. I don't know what it means by do you think it was justified.Ashleigh
718 2018-09-13 22:21:17 Clark and Sebastian hated the oil companies because they harvest oil from the ground which destroys nature. Also we don't think it was justified. Hamish, Matias

720 2018-09-13 22:21:06 Clark and Sebastian hated the oil companies because they are harming the environment. It can also sometimes kill humans.

724 2018-09-13 22:20:45 I think they hated the oil companies because the oil companies pollute the air and the sea but no I dont think what they were planing was justified.(Briah)

726 2018-09-13 22:20:42 I'm eating dinner in a restaurant filled with nursing home evacuees.

So far I've overheard conversations about:
-how someone's spouse died
-winning a $15 jackpot at bingo
-how only butter will do on bread and how oil to dip it in is a terrible fad
-recent hospitalizations 


727 2018-09-13 22:20:18 clark and sebastian hated the oil companys because they were killing the earth and the enviroment.

731 2018-09-13 22:19:56 I think James was a good guy because he stooped the help earth comity from killing all those oil company leaders. Although the oil leaders have poisoned people after that attack help earth could release another round of anthrax killing heaps of people. Thomas and Riley
732 2018-09-13 22:19:48 Today, my ADM asked a partner how things are going with me helping, His reply: "she's like oil" - like I help the engine go smoothly. @ArianneReza_  tried to save this one by using olive oil as a comparison, but he corrected  - nope - Motor grease :) Ha! #EpicWorkFunny :)
733 2018-09-13 22:19:47 Wade at victory oil has a monster energy drink tattoo on his forearm, so he's immediately docked a point, but he knocked 5 bucks off my new air filter so he's regained that point. #lookingpastthetattoo

735 2018-09-13 22:19:27 Lmao please girl you’ve got a lot of the special oil 
736 2018-09-13 22:19:18 Good to see the big players in the Aussie market giving the old "peak oil"  narrative a nudge. Never say die, eh? #FuelPriceHike
737 2018-09-13 22:19:15 No she along with the federal Liberals have done something the Conservatives never did to the oil sector give them tax dollars directly. Indirect subsidies are one thing but directly giving them money is something completely different. Paying them off isnt diversifying

740 2018-09-13 22:18:42 In the oil biz you Trump haters would be known as "dry holers".
741 2018-09-13 22:18:36 ACC, 2016: "Eat more [fruits], vegetables and whole grains. [Replace unwanted sugar and fat] with plant-based foods ... fruits, vegetables and grains, and [replace] cholesterol and saturated fats [with] healthier monounsaturated fats like olive oil and nuts." Go argue with them.
742 2018-09-13 22:18:35 Majority of happenings in the muslim world are largely because of the colonial past and discovery of oil.
743 2018-09-13 22:18:32 i need to go get my oil changed tomorrow !
744 2018-09-13 22:18:30 you vs me in a oil wrestling match  BROTHER. -HH.
745 2018-09-13 22:18:24 they hated the oil companys because they were poisoning the baby children. cameron brayden
746 2018-09-13 22:18:23 Think about the chain of businesses and processes to get the petrol in your tank from oil buried underground.

your car doesn't care about how the electricity was generated. It could be from coal or gas, but also wind, nuclear, solar or anything else.
747 2018-09-13 22:18:19 Crude oil producer, are you kidding?  Where'd America get crude oil?
748 2018-09-13 22:17:59 Ayo beard oil is the truth.
749 2018-09-13 22:17:57 IM LITERALLY USING LIKE.. craft acrylics I’ve had for 6 years LOL.. I wish when I was in college I took a oil class because the material learning curve frightens me but I’m sure I could find an easy tut on google
750 2018-09-13 22:17:46 $40 oil change to $70 oil change cause I have fancier oil now. #whytho
751 2018-09-13 22:17:39 In Huckabee Sanders case political ideology not protected class like if she was trans or black, otherwise discrimination laws apply. 
Same in FB where speech is protected, getting through the digital door to speak is not.
752 2018-09-13 22:17:27 Pep Boys is the worst. Went in for an oil change like yourself 4 months ago&since then the car has been sluggish. I hope everything is resolved soon for you. Pep boys used to be a great Philly corporation but they’ve lost their service and values ever since the Icahn acquisition.
753 2018-09-13 22:17:24 There are 2,000 companies in the Oil and Gas industry in CO(Forbes est.)  Mom and pop companies to large public companies.  Upstream companies like Extraction to 3 man drilling services companies. They all go away with a 'Yes' vote.

757 2018-09-13 22:17:11 He used harmless anthrax so he wouldn't harm any innocents so when the oil company came it would only kill them its like the flu injection it protects you.
Todd Baxter :D
758 2018-09-13 22:17:01 Golden potatoes, onions, bell peppers, and sausage topped with salt, pepper, and olive oil then baked. Not sure how long or what temp 
759 2018-09-13 22:17:01 that is what snake oil selling, carpet bagging, swindlers do. #DonTheCon
760 2018-09-13 22:16:37 @CNN  answer will be @ChrisCuomo and @andersoncooper shirtless oil wrestling as the storm comes ashore.
761 2018-09-13 22:16:35 Which essential oil brand is your favorite?
762 2018-09-13 22:16:32 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
763 2018-09-13 22:16:28 Oil dey your head guy .
764 2018-09-13 22:16:25 People look at you like you’re crazy when you tell them you use honey, milk and olive oil on your hair and skin  I’m not crazy I just like natural stuff that’s not gonna wreck my skin or hair anymore! Plus my hair and skin have never looked so damn good!!!
765 2018-09-13 22:16:22 I can’t stand you. 
You should try some Neem oil. It will spark your glow up. Hopefully!
766 2018-09-13 22:16:21 Let a real nigga give you a hot oil treatment.
767 2018-09-13 22:16:09 Notley gave 200million to build a refinery and hinted at giving 2billion of AB taxpayer money on top of the 4.5b the feds have already spent on TM pipeline. Tell me again of this wonderful diversification of the AB economy away from the oil industry.
768 2018-09-13 22:16:08 Check your Engine oil this morning.
769 2018-09-13 22:16:04 Would it help if I put coconut oil on my GPA?
770 2018-09-13 22:15:57 Why do having errands done feel so damn pleasing? Lol laundry  bills ahead of time  dinner for the next couple days  flea market for new old trinkets  oil change & car washed  gym  and it’s not even six 
771 2018-09-13 22:15:57 Oh what the wingdings going to do now Eu copyrighted memes.  No more whiskey export tax,Croany report, secret oil pipes, invisible water pipes. Unicorns. Could they be forced to try facts?? !
772 2018-09-13 22:15:53 I wouldn’t buy a used car off the man, you know the engine would have sawdustbin the oil and the service history would be faked.
773 2018-09-13 22:15:43 Luckily we have home heating oil. Thoughts and prayers for our neighbors in #northandover , #andover and #Lawrence
774 2018-09-13 22:15:34 yeah coconut oil is def the disgusting option here............
775 2018-09-13 22:15:31 Surely Cheviot, Stag and the Black Black Oil?
776 2018-09-13 22:15:27 I had a tiny drop of sesame oil on my lunch and I can still taste it.
777 2018-09-13 22:15:20 Simple

I am not here to speak a lot, I am here to say the Banking industry that control the 4 biggest oil companies are killing the world as they want to control markets and technology by killing innovation and keeping us as they slaves

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk 
778 2018-09-13 22:15:19 like they put hella oil in it before and after they make it lol its nasty
779 2018-09-13 22:15:17 How has the government benefited from 9/11 ? The argument was it was done for vast oil reserves . What oil reserves have we picked up ?  I don't trust the government one bit however the outcome just doesn't make it real especially given the time passed.
780 2018-09-13 22:14:45 Activists (including @CenterForBioDiv) r wise to pressure Brown. 1) He increased CA oil drilling and can stop. 2) His evolving climate policy is influenced by activist pressure.

This is a political dynamic. Give experienced political activists cred for knowing how to work it
781 2018-09-13 22:14:44 From the man who worships a bearded man in the sky, pays no #tax and who is an ex oil executive!

784 2018-09-13 22:14:30 @Jenna_Marbles my cat has stepped in oil paint in the past. DAWN DISH SOAP is very effective it will just take a few washes. It makes sense they use it to save duckies from oil spills!
785 2018-09-13 22:14:25 God is good because I’ve wanted to order some CBD oil and cream and I just got some for freeeee
786 2018-09-13 22:14:15 Because they were from a terrorist group called Help Earth and oil rigs were making the world worse. - Jack,Matthew and Ethan
787 2018-09-13 22:14:03 Sabastian and Clark hated the oil companies because they were owned by rich greedy people who didn't care what they did to the world. I think it was completely justified to hate these people because I do too.
Charlotte H
788 2018-09-13 22:14:00 You ever use just straight coconut oil? Not a lot, but a bit. I have THICK fucking hair and I use it to kill volume. I know it's honestly not super great for your hair, but it works I guess
789 2018-09-13 22:13:59 Waiting on an oil change gives me time to respond to emails and look up all the stuff I have put off #adulting
790 2018-09-13 22:13:56 get you some jamaican black castor oil and fast.
791 2018-09-13 22:13:55 If @jaredpolis and @WalkerStapleton are opposed to proposition 112, then they are both in the pockets of big oil and gas companies, hence corrupt, hence not worth voting for. They’re just more corruption
792 2018-09-13 22:13:48 85% of America's global economy is powered by oil & gas & coal. Our #RFID tags are made to withstand the harsh conditions of these fields.
793 2018-09-13 22:13:47 They hated the oil companies because they drill into the earth and wreck it and then start polluting and all the gas harms people. Liam
794 2018-09-13 22:13:44 Omg an hour for an oil change 
795 2018-09-13 22:13:37 Okay so how do we move away from oil. Take me for example: I drive a diesel 3/4 ton pick up truck which I need for the work I do. What vehicle do you recommend to replace it? What about construction vehicles etc. etc. The technology doesn't exist or is horribly expensive.
796 2018-09-13 22:13:35 YES! They definitely have a right to hate the oil companies because it is killing the animals, but you also don't because you get your petrol for your car and other things! 

Taymah and Bella
797 2018-09-13 22:13:29 Coconut oil? (Ducks)
798 2018-09-13 22:13:28 They hated the oil companies because they ruin the earth and environment. Wiremu
799 2018-09-13 22:13:28 Baby oil all done all gone no hair loss
800 2018-09-13 22:13:22 Because they were bribing the police, causing environmental damage, hurting people.  Basically they have all the power because we rely on oil.
801 2018-09-13 22:13:20 Clark and Sebastion hated the oil company because they bribed the police and everyone needed money from it. 
Katelyn and Ellena
802 2018-09-13 22:13:15 they are trying to get rid of oil because oil is used alot on earth. nah #Kellee #Brooke
803 2018-09-13 22:13:14 Because the oil can kill animals in the ocean and it can also kill people.

Iela and Eteta
804 2018-09-13 22:13:11 They hated them because the oil was poisoning the land and the water. I think they had the right to hate the companies because oil can be poisonous.

Tamsin
805 2018-09-13 22:13:07 Clark and Sebastian hate the oil companies because they think that the oil in the water was killing the children.

Darcy & Sienna
806 2018-09-13 22:13:04 They hated the oil companies because they were destroying the environment and they are all hippies so the love the environment. Reef
807 2018-09-13 22:13:03 For once a Deltan of impeccable record's coming forward to sanitise the murky political waters of Nigeria's turbulent oil base.
808 2018-09-13 22:12:57 Lol ok... Useful to remember the same NOI not Buhari took us back into debt as finance minister with record high oil prices/ revenue 
809 2018-09-13 22:12:55 They were saying that the oil was polluting the water and the children were drinking from that water and they were dying. Yes they had the right to hate them because they were killing their children.

810 2018-09-13 22:12:53 Gotta keep it . It's a staple . What's wrong with these guys ? Oil up and hit the gym with me , that's a really good game .... gotta have them all !!!!
811 2018-09-13 22:12:50 Bravo Texas oil!!
812 2018-09-13 22:12:46 Ciara don’t want his boring ass when there’s that hot piece of man candy Ben waiting for her. Tripp can have Olive Oil.
813 2018-09-13 22:12:43 My favorite subject is math 
814 2018-09-13 22:12:41 Suncor was non-comital on upgrading. Again, it's a market thing: refinery margins are extremely small. There wouldn't be payback before peak oil hits all of us.
815 2018-09-13 22:12:25 Thanks! Yeah, it’s super simple! I just put some oil in my mouth and swish t around for about 20 mins.  It helps the pain and clean your teeth! Yeah, I’m still in pain, but it’s cut way back!  Also, benedryl works well if it’s a sinus toothache.
816 2018-09-13 22:12:17 Lexus RC-350 w/ F pkg 2wd, loaded 2 the max, local trade!!!  Free oil changes & wiperblades for life.
817 2018-09-13 22:12:14 Because they thought they were poisoning the lakes/water. 
Yes because I think they had a right to hate the oil company because the oil is gonna kill the animal but at the same time it gives your cars petrol!!

Chanakah
818 2018-09-13 22:12:11 They hated the oil companies because they ruin the earth and environment. Connor
819 2018-09-13 22:12:08 Clark and Sebastian didn't like the oil companies because it kills children and they bursts in farm and they get the blame.

820 2018-09-13 22:12:01 pro tip: Avon's skin so soft best repellent ever 
was in Ponce & Mayagüez Puerto Rico * 80's swarms everywhere 
 stuff works , I guess they actually made their own line of repellent 
don't know about that but , the original bath oil saved my life back then
821 2018-09-13 22:11:49 Serious question -- if lavender essential oil (for example) did seem to calm an animal down, is there any *harm* in using it? I don't have any pets, but I am genuinely curious.
822 2018-09-13 22:11:45 You go for an oil change. You leave with a wrecked subframe.
823 2018-09-13 22:11:41 Clark and Sebastian hate oil companies because the oils are poisoning and ruining the earth. -Payton and Haylee
824 2018-09-13 22:11:37 Clark and Sebastian hated the oil companies because they bribe and steal things. Yes I do think it was justified. - Izzy
825 2018-09-13 22:11:32 Si fuese para cambiar la analogía de petróleo "data is the new oil", yo diría que los datos son como el diamante. Entre mejor calidad y mejor pulidos, más aumenta su valor.
826 2018-09-13 22:11:17 The oil was getting into the kids drinking water. #Kate
827 2018-09-13 22:11:16 The oil was positioning the water and killing people and people were going to jail for things they didn't do. Yes they had a right to dislike the oil companies.
Chloe
828 2018-09-13 22:11:10 This Uber driver has to be burning oil in this car. Like my eyes are burning in this backseat...
829 2018-09-13 22:11:10 No oil/gas for BC... turn off the pipes etc

832 2018-09-13 22:10:59 Clark and Sebastian were trying to get rid of oil because oil is use alot and they were trying to help earth , I think it was justified Cody
833 2018-09-13 22:10:43 Speak for yourself, it is not unreaonable to think YOU, Andy  are evl to the core and damaged goods, but don't project your failings on the rest of us, or your phony snake oil "cure".
834 2018-09-13 22:10:42 Because the oil companies do not care about pollution or the environment. #dylan #charlie #danil
835 2018-09-13 22:10:40 because he didn't want the staff there to die just the oil companies they work because it helps fight anthrax.
#jesse #dana
@ChapterChatNZ
836 2018-09-13 22:10:40 NO more subsidies to oilsands corps. That's no better than buying a pipeline. We need to move away from oil.
837 2018-09-13 22:10:39 Once I needed to buy lavender essential oil so I went into a health shop, I couldn’t see the price when I grabbed the little bottle of the lavender oil but when I got to the counter it was $38. It was too late for me to back out
838 2018-09-13 22:10:39 Sebastian and Clark hated the oil companies because of the story about the pipeline on the farm and because they bribe and steal. i think it was justified- Max
839 2018-09-13 22:10:36 Jobs can be replaced...our environment cannot. Plus those jobs will be lost soon once the oil runs out...so how do you propose to stop that?
840 2018-09-13 22:10:34 Because The Oil polluted drinking water and it made it not  Clugable or Drinkable  #Allen
841 2018-09-13 22:10:27 essential oil kit - 10% off PLUS I offer $25 off -making it only $119 Good through Friday. I can’t tell you how good of a value that is.

851 2018-09-13 22:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
852 2018-09-13 22:09:32 Oil and gas companies will be slowing down soon regardless. WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF OIL. It HURTS our environment...jobs can be replaced, our environment CANNOT
853 2018-09-13 22:08:57 Soap throws off our natural PH balance and can make us sick. So I'm against destroying your child's organic tissue over a few bad manners. However Castor Oil is disgusting, but doesn't cause any harm.
So Castor Oil away!
854 2018-09-13 22:08:56 I'm somehow imagining the engine doesn't run on hemp oil

856 2018-09-13 22:08:33 All this will do, if enacted, is to promote far more dangerous oil train shipping. Better if you take some of the revenue to invest in science and engineering R&D.
857 2018-09-13 22:08:30 WTF-keep those kids out of the water! Storm runoff water loaded w/ lawn/home pesticides, gas/oil from the roads & cars, I mean, really? Look at the serious illnesses that came from Harvey. Also critters (read:snakes) will be trying to find calm from the storm. SMH.

867 2018-09-13 22:07:37 Resources from their land is the reason you have mouth to talk and food to eat. Your lifeless president can't do without their oil.
868 2018-09-13 22:07:35 Thanks to Donald #Trump's tremendous efforts, the US is now world's largest producer of oil. We must double our efforts to also become world's largest producers of coal and firewood!
869 2018-09-13 22:07:22 Funny, they said the oil industry is capable of terrorism, but it was GREENPEACE that was found to have a ‘criminal purpose’ by the Charities Commission, and its NZ Director Russel Norman is facing criminal sentencing.
870 2018-09-13 22:07:19 i simply cannot believe that people still buy and use baby oil - a product whose name can only possibly suggest that it is made from real babies
871 2018-09-13 22:07:09 hmmm Texas-very rich oil state gets massive support & help, Florida - massive republican state with wealth gets massive support, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, poor, mostly minorities, poor, poor states experience huge failures in gov't help, more deaths....all under Republican rule
872 2018-09-13 22:07:03 If taxpayers would subsidize the necessary $2 Billion in improvements to refine our own oil in the east. Would there not be many long term benefits? Just a question for your opinion.

874 2018-09-13 22:07:02 @KatyaBee4 how do you propose to stop environmental damage caused by big oil and gas companies? How do you plan to deal with climate change caused by oil and gas? What happens when it all runs out? You’re not really thinking too hard about what truly matters in the long run...

892 2018-09-13 22:05:23 Definitely agree with Irving and price but Suncor would have done it because it was largely their bitumen I think. I thought we import more oil from the US then SA etc. ? At any rate, even as a conservative I would be willing to subsidize the construction to reduce imports.

900 2018-09-13 22:04:26 Is the #Andover natural gas disaster being caused by a fault in the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline? It's ownership/operation is directly, or subsidiary, of @Enbridge, the company that owns the oil pipeline with the major spill in Marshall, MI several years ago.

903 2018-09-13 22:03:53 Needed an Aleve to relieve a post-jelly donut headache I acquired yesterday. Not surprisingly, the safe mild effective hempseed oil+cinnamon combo was no match for this growling beast of a head-splitter. 1st time I needed pain relief pill in about a month. 
No jelly donuts 4 me!
904 2018-09-13 22:03:45 Did you know that most vegetable oil is soybean oil? (sometimes with some corn oil and canola oil [rapeseed) added in.  Humm.
905 2018-09-13 22:03:36 Yes you are right. We get sweet oil from the U S. Even Newfoundland exports it's sweet oil to the U.S. It's about markets and business, period. There are little to no markets for Bitumen in Canada and there never will be.

908 2018-09-13 22:03:27 They have these regulations because the oil and gas companies have caused so much environmental damage that we need to recover from. Fracking release massive amounts of methane into the environment, and they don’t care, they fight regulations that would prevent the release of it

910 2018-09-13 22:03:17 For the first time since 1973, the United States is the world's largest producer of crude oil, according to preliminary estimates published on Wednesday by the Energy Department.

914 2018-09-13 22:02:59 Yeah while we fool around with oil China and other countries are INNOVATING! They're crushing us taking the lead in clean energy and we're still screwing around with oil. PATHETIC! Way to set the bar! We're behind and it's bc of idiot's like you!

How?As always,by military force.I wonder if no one with brains have remind US of many Venezuela's pals, Rusia, China, India, Iran, etc, that have CAPITAL invested there.

927 2018-09-13 22:01:27 I remember when it was about acid rain, not global warming. Nobody challenged the scientists until CO2 came up and threatened the oil industry.
928 2018-09-13 22:01:25 Oil and natural gas are destroying our beautiful state. The oil and gas industry, for years, has been paying off politicians and paying millions in media coverage, to cover the truth on their fight against regulations set to help preserve the planet...they’re the ones hurting us
929 2018-09-13 22:01:25 Need some ingredients pala. Sesame oil tsaka HONEY! HAHAHAHAHAHA 
930 2018-09-13 22:01:06 Hmm... Refineries margin all over the world getting thinner. Basically, higher crude price, lower refinery margin.

Nobody wants to own oil refinery. But its necessity evil in large O&G co. complex structure. The gains always include the cost optimisation and certainty of supply.

949 2018-09-13 21:59:27 There is no wonder drug. It's sweat, pain and dedication. Just another snake oil ad...
950 2018-09-13 21:59:27 The guy runs his tour bus on used French fry oil instead of fossil fuels. In drilling/refining/fracking Texas. I’m sure he gives exactly zero fucks about hurting Republican fee-fees.

952 2018-09-13 21:59:13 Hi matt, as I tweeted about 2 months ago with Trump renewing sanctions again to Iran not exporting oil now and the oz $  down Has created a perfect storm of high prices.

The 80s were fun!
954 2018-09-13 21:58:34 Yeah but, a skinny fanatical fascist would be in the same predicament, i.e. an economy, pretty much, solely based on oil.
955 2018-09-13 21:58:12 Made chicken fried steak with pork rinds, cabbage in avocado oil and homemade Alfredo sauce. Omg I’m so loving this way of cooking! #ketolife

957 2018-09-13 21:58:08 Let's face it we have a disfunctional country - BC and QC don't want pipelines just the revenue from oil. We've evolved into a bunch of self serving   groups.

970 2018-09-13 21:55:48 'Local Hero' is on here too... Bit late for the tourist season, maybe it's to tell us that US oil companies will change their minds about fracking Scotland, and build astronomical research stations instead.
(I do have a nasty suspicious mind, but with justification).

987 2018-09-13 21:53:50 I especially loved, "Alaska doesn't count because oil is involved".
988 2018-09-13 21:53:41 Yep, I've heard of them. Haven't had a chance to give them a try personally, but I know others have used them to success. I often mix regular oil paints into my rotation (not directly of course, in between varnish layers) and have no issue, so I'm sure they would work fine.
989 2018-09-13 21:53:36 Oil n pepper flakes too
990 2018-09-13 21:53:20 85% of oil well found in the Delta region is owned by Northerners. Most Southerners including GEJ do not own oil wells. National wealth is now converted to personal wealth
991 2018-09-13 21:53:18 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
992 2018-09-13 21:53:09 medicinal grade olive oil
993 2018-09-13 21:53:03 We actually import not as much Saudi oil. We get the most from the US I believe.
994 2018-09-13 21:52:51 There is no need for oil or coal to generate electricity(see Ont). Electric cars are seeing significant growth in sales and development and are not far from being mainstream. No form of transit is perfect, but even with batteries electric is better in most cases.
995 2018-09-13 21:52:47 So my bro needs a oil change and I’m up rn so i get the oil for him, advanced auto like here you get a free pair of socks with that. Fast forward 4 hours later Im at work with low socks and my ankles getting attacked by some 2k19 mosquitos and i have an extra pair of socks
996 2018-09-13 21:52:26 Solutions are ready.  There is life after Oil.  This is not human nature or a lost cause.  It’s tyranny, and we can overcome it if we’ll name it and fight it.
997 2018-09-13 21:52:22 About to take a hot bath and immerse my skin in some Neem oil.
998 2018-09-13 21:52:15 Back to Dianes comments, the US shale oil was much easier to get and refine in the east.
999 2018-09-13 21:52:07 Largest oil producer till we run out. Oil is finite. Wind is not. Solar is not.
1000 2018-09-13 21:52:05 What leads you to believe capital costs in Norway are lower than here?  Most of Norway's oil is offshore and just as expensive to extract.  Even with transport diff it lowers revenue by maybe 50% (in the extreme).  A TRILLION is literally thousands of times more than AB saved.

1002 2018-09-13 21:52:01 His govt also pressuring India on S400 purchase from Russia, on Iran oil (Iran offers rupee payment). So it's mixed bag. 

Point is Bharat has to be strong regardless of who is USA President. 

FYI: even in Hindu community in US, no uniform opinion on Trump.
1003 2018-09-13 21:51:39 That beautiful future will require more than signing SB100. We also need to stop drilling for gas & oil. This is #brownslastchance to be a true climate leader & stop fossil fuel extraction in CA communities. No more sacrifice zones. #RiseForClimate #GCAS2018

1005 2018-09-13 21:51:16 *staring into space and trying to remember the last time I did an oil change voice* I should probably do that
1006 2018-09-13 21:51:09 It is snake oil pure and simple. They are parasitizing a vulnerable audience. It's fraud they should be arrested and locked up.
1007 2018-09-13 21:51:04 Suncor would have built a coker in its refinery if the pipeline went ahead. (Provided the oil prices were what they were at the time) Agreed there were two terminals considered. One in Quebec and an Irving one.
1008 2018-09-13 21:50:49 Mix witch hazel & green alcohol & rub in. Or, peppermint lotion/foot rub. A lavender oil may not be strong enough. My sis-in-law also introduced my whole family to Vick's vaporub on swellings. We were like "Whaaaa?" But damned if the knot on nephew's head went down! Magic!
1009 2018-09-13 21:50:48 Oil and water don’t mix.
1010 2018-09-13 21:50:42 On average 22 veterans commit suicide every day. 

They’re not added to the death tolls of whatever conflict killed them via PTSD. 

I know guys exposed to burning oil wells who cannot get benefits right now for various illnesses. Why is that, you suppose?
1011 2018-09-13 21:50:40 Really debating whether I should do my own oil change or not. I’m within 200k of a change and the place I usually go to is booked up
1012 2018-09-13 21:50:35 I agree with you on that statement it was because of oil and Cheney’s Halliburton contracts. Saudi were involved and who is good friends with the royal family...bush
1013 2018-09-13 21:50:33 The only frustration this “westerner” has is the incompetence of @BradWall306 and @PremierScottMoe and how they continue to beat the alienation drum. It’s was Wall who gave Harper a pass on over $800 million a year and then blew our savings on tax breaks for his oil buddies.
1014 2018-09-13 21:50:25 "Ms. Sgamma [president of the Western Energy Alliance, an association of independent oil and gas companies] praised the Trump administration for turning the oil companies’ requests into policy." 

Of course, the profits are huge if you don't have to worry about killing humans.
1015 2018-09-13 21:50:21 My Lyft rental needs an oil change so stuck for a couple of hours, hoping Dayna has a great day.
1016 2018-09-13 21:50:15 Dark, cold rooms. I have taken prescription meds for them. Topimax made my hair fall out  and imitrex puts me to sleep so I use it sparingly. Lavender oil and peppermint tea work!
1017 2018-09-13 21:50:10 I need a hot oil treatment & deep condition all in one

Perhaps tempera on wood for Selesnya.
Golgari would definitely use oil on vellum!
I first thought ink wash would be Izzet, but Azorius corrected: Izzet use "lasers", on everything. #MTGGRN

1023 2018-09-13 21:49:22 #AQMDChatter - lots of discussion of the internal bank during the #RECLAIM sunset discussions. Essential public services are throwing their weight around to make sure that oil companies, gas companies and others do not drain their credits from the internal bank.
1024 2018-09-13 21:49:21 How much can you pay
1025 2018-09-13 21:49:17 It’s all dependent on the ingredients. Would you call a toasted ham and cheese sandwich a panini? Usually olive oil is used in a panini. Butter for a grilled cheese and nothing for a toasted sub. Sliced bread would be for a grilled cheese or possibly a panini.

Soak the table in warm water and scrub with dish soap in circles. Saturate it as well as you can with dish soap. DO NOT USE HAND SOAP
1029 2018-09-13 21:48:46 LMAO this girl said her frys were “Too Oily” when she asked for them to be well done so obviously they were gonna be in the oil longer
1030 2018-09-13 21:48:30 I don’t want  consumers funding terrorist regimes which our buying ME oil effectively does. Also, let’s get some energy hungry Chinese & Indian cash flowing through our economy #AmericaFirst #EnergyIndependence
1031 2018-09-13 21:48:14 The "stranded asset" argument is pure nonsense. Demand for oil and gas are increasing. We just need to make sure our assets aren't allowed to become stranded by foreign-funded activists. #BuildTransMountain

1038 2018-09-13 21:47:37 He's one of the most pro green energy gov ever... he can't just abruptly cut off oil needs.... FFS be more reasonable people.  Baby steps is how it always goes.
1039 2018-09-13 21:47:28 The #DiGASter that is going on in Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover is a major part of why we need to move away from Gas and Oil and fully run on Solar/Renewable Energy, this explosive time is a travesty for that region of Massachusetts and clear proof of why this must change.
1040 2018-09-13 21:47:17 that’s true! we’re very sorry for your unfortunate experience. if you’re still looking to try out hemp/cbd oil, try us out :) 
1041 2018-09-13 21:47:15 Did we mention fishing, oil production, farming industries and how BORING life would be if I had to live in fucking Kansas!

1045 2018-09-13 21:46:29 Extraordinary oil curls by L’Oréal works really good especially if is dry
1046 2018-09-13 21:46:24 We don't know why (and to distract ourselves from waiting for the Direct), but we're feeling ridiculously hungry...

We dreamed of having a feast.  Whole turkey, salmon and tuna, bread with olive oil, baked potatoes, tea and cookies...

So odd that we're having food dreams...
1047 2018-09-13 21:46:17 Let hair rest between color treatments. Stay away from sulfates. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? for stopping hair loss. or something? I can't seem to come across the precise portal. A great find. Had no parabens.
1048 2018-09-13 21:46:16 Great job promoting.

Make sure the olive oil is extra virgin and is in a dark glass bottle.

You loose the benefits when it's in a transparent and plastic bottle.

The light damages the chemical structure of the oil.

The plastics absorb into the fatty acids of the oil.
1049 2018-09-13 21:46:12 Black pepper and olive oil with brie to take away the wicker factor 
1050 2018-09-13 21:46:00 There was high surplus production of oil in the month of August, #oilprice is still up. As #Iran oil #sanctions resumes in Nov, oil market is expected to tighten. We're already paying less gas for more buck now. #oilprice
1051 2018-09-13 21:45:39 That was all 2015 propaganda which he has already debunked. Though no oil block then but now he must have approved one for self.

1053 2018-09-13 21:45:27 I see you still haven't told pregnant women not to use products with clary sage oil in because it can induce miscarriage. Rather irresponsible of you, unless you are using fragrant rather than essential oils.

1064 2018-09-13 21:44:16 I don't even own a cell phone. I support the oil and gas industry as well. Doing my part more so than #boycottgreenpeace and their cult following.
1065 2018-09-13 21:44:05 our goblin tinkerer rolled a 1 to throw a Molotov cocktail to instead the oil splashed everywhere & so we had to make dexterity saves every turn, on a fail we’d slip & fall.

1071 2018-09-13 21:42:45 If they could lower their costs I'm sure that they would. I understand many breweries cannot afford to drop prices and remain competitive. If we had a free market when it comes to pricing alcohol, as they do south of the border; that could change. We all need to support oil.
1072 2018-09-13 21:42:44 That would work too, yes? There are a lot of ways to do this, to hold producers to account? Was just thinking of sugar due to news but lots of ways to address the hydra (eg wd also love to see something around regulating uncertified palm oil)
1073 2018-09-13 21:42:42 Awful customers in last month, they ordered oil with eggplant how do they manage to gormandize so badly? They definitely wouldn't do that at home.
1074 2018-09-13 21:42:41 Me too! I don't have breakouts if I eat them sparingly. It's the peanut oil.
1075 2018-09-13 21:42:25 Also sorry more #Witcher3 advice 

Is there any penalties for constantly putting oil onto your sword?
1076 2018-09-13 21:42:24 Please say you didn't mention the $1trillion sovereign oil fund. That always necessitates a violent scream with appropriate volley of expletives
1077 2018-09-13 21:42:04 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
1078 2018-09-13 21:42:04 They invaded Iraq bc of oil. Had planned it a year before 9-11. Saudi Arabia was the big terrorist sponsor, not Iraq.  You are just making stuff up, rewriting history in "Post-Fact" Era.  Facts are facts. Iraq War has caused unending war, and created millions of terrorists.
1079 2018-09-13 21:41:39 It’s just cold there’s no oil
1080 2018-09-13 21:41:34 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
1081 2018-09-13 21:41:34 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1084 2018-09-13 21:41:26 Helps a lot too. The steam will help make it easier to blink In'sha'Allah. But you might wanna put some olive oil on it lightly after the steam/cloth cos itll help make it feel easier to blink and thanks to the steam from the towel, the sti'll begin to shrink&eventually disappear
1085 2018-09-13 21:41:23 Senator, we need more like  u representing our state , who will continue to work to rid the negative stigma of corruption in Louisiana politics.

1090 2018-09-13 21:41:05 I used that Smuckers Orange Marmalade? In a sauce pan with soy sauce, reduce. Maybe some Ginger or sesame oil. Either or none and some red pepper flakes. When cooled sauce is thicker and you can slowcook chicken or just throw it on some chicken done.
1091 2018-09-13 21:40:58 I sourced some CBD oil for him. Albeit illegal stuff. Ridiculous you have to break the law to help a loved one. Can't say for sure if it helped or not but certainly done him no harm.

1104 2018-09-13 21:39:58 I LOVE hearing from the farmers, how Seed to Seal impacts the hands that produce the oil. 
1105 2018-09-13 21:39:49 That’s why we never mixed like water with the oil
1106 2018-09-13 21:39:39 I bought an essential oil diffuser and apparently peppermint helps with headaches so I got that and my headache went almost completely away then I took a solid nap and I feel great and hungry

1108 2018-09-13 21:39:34 RRI interesting. In fact, I'm wondering what I'm missing? Why priced so attractively? Production 78% NG but 50% revenues from oil/NGL's. $60 million in liquidity for acquisitions. Assumptions are $66 WTI - $62 realized for oil and $2.83 $2.57 for NG. 10% drop equals 10% div yld.

1111 2018-09-13 21:38:59 the money Venezuela earned from oil exports was used to import goods that they didn't have the industries to produce at home. They also provided income to people that didn't work.
The crisis now is because the oil market is flooded.  Venezuela can't import good like before.
1112 2018-09-13 21:38:55 We have been driving cars for over 100 years. At least 2 billion people drive a day on earth. HOW THE FUCK HAVE WE NOT RAN OUT OF OIL!
1113 2018-09-13 21:38:45 Production leads... US crude shares fell 5.3 million barrels on September 7th to 396.2 million barrels... February, 2015, 3% below 5 year average... US crude oil production: fell by 100,000 bpd, 10.9 million bpd... industry faces pipeline capacity
1114 2018-09-13 21:38:30 Global oil prices fell on Thursday from four-month highs. Brent crude fell by US$1.56 or 2.0% to US$78.18 a barrel and the US Nymex price fell by US$1.78 or 2.5% to US$68.59 a barrel.

1117 2018-09-13 21:38:23 We all suffer if we burn the oil...  It harms us all.  It endangers life for our children and will be the great shame of our generation.  Invest in clean energy and stop the subsidies to dirty oil.
1118 2018-09-13 21:38:00 Due to my hypothyroidism, my skin doesn’t know if it’s my age or a teenager’s. So for daytime I combat oil using Control Moisturizer for oily skin & their Seaweed Night Cream to bed. I love that this combo balances this face when everything else is out of wack! 
1119 2018-09-13 21:37:40 Or even Forte Oil sef
1120 2018-09-13 21:37:30 @3HL1045 bulletproof coffee. Some combination of butter and coconut oil
1121 2018-09-13 21:37:29 Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Thursday applauded #Russia for its moves to boost oil production in advance of the reimposition of U.S. tariffs against #Iran.
1122 2018-09-13 21:37:27 + Rubbing castor oil over my pelvic helps me !
1123 2018-09-13 21:37:08 WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH RESPECT TO NAFTA ??????   WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH RESPECT TO OIL PIPELINE -  GIVE CANADIANS NEWS NOT BABY BABBLE
1124 2018-09-13 21:37:06 Venezuela is a socialist country due to its vast oil reserves. Not because of leftists.  The country invested so much money in oil production that they didn't develop other industries. People had no where to work.
1125 2018-09-13 21:37:02 mix a drink with peanut oil
1126 2018-09-13 21:36:54 Remember to rub your boobies with olive oil and your feet with Vaseline
1127 2018-09-13 21:36:34 Theres a 100 groups involved. Allegiances change on an almost daily basis. But its clear AQ on the whole, the bulk of groups affiliated to AQ and Al Nusra etc, are all wanting to topple Assad, for oil/gas and over "Cold War" rivalries..
1128 2018-09-13 21:36:25 Ah website error then

  Leduc Woodbend Oil Kings  Edmonton MLAC         1 - 5
1129 2018-09-13 21:36:25 The US just became the leading producer in crude oil.  Why hasn’t gas prices dropped 
1130 2018-09-13 21:36:20 I mean when the revolution happened foreign hackers attacked essentially their entire Oil production facility locking them out and creating damages across the supply line. 

I'm not defending the Venezuelan government but claiming it happened in a vacuum or that it's the natural
1131 2018-09-13 21:36:19 Yeah... Obama really burned the midnight oil     You can call Trump a lot of things, but lazy is not one of them
1132 2018-09-13 21:36:19 unfortunately, one too many are still digging into new research rather than stepping back and reassess certain things that may have been wrongly researched. EG: coconut oil.. back 40 or 40 yrs ago, they may have researched the refined oil extracting...
1133 2018-09-13 21:36:10 A freshening facial mask, bright red, with wine, evening primrose oil, and exfoliating crushed lemon seed. It's an earthy block.
1134 2018-09-13 21:36:00 Mhum ... coconut oil. Ask Karen. She knows 
1135 2018-09-13 21:35:31 @GreenpeaceNZ I tweeted how other countries subsidised people who put in Solar power. Unfortunately a Mark Graham message me I said it will never take over from coal or oil energy. Some people just don't understand
1136 2018-09-13 21:35:26 Raising cost of imported energy... by 2019... trade disputes... $80 a barrel, yesterday... the 1st time since May... US sanctions against Iran’s oil exports, glim markets... US tight crude pushed over $70... Wednesday: due to falling US crude..
1137 2018-09-13 21:35:22 Place your bets on the Race for The Weald Oil.#UKOG #Angusenergy
1138 2018-09-13 21:35:19 These airlines hedge against rising oil prices. These bag fees are a money grab.
1139 2018-09-13 21:35:09 Its possible... fish #150, egg #100, pepper #150 cos i dont this there is tomato in it, oil #50, maggi #30.. am having #20 change remaining..
1140 2018-09-13 21:35:08 James tries to stop an evil oil tycoon, making good use of his new X-Ray Knife.
1141 2018-09-13 21:35:07 Okay Seriously,I know i am a chronically Forgetful and Careless Child.
But I've been trying a lot and I wld av said am a lot better and Changed except that i nevr remember to take out this Evil sachet oil in Indomie Onion Chicken before pouring it into the PotArrrrghhhh
1142 2018-09-13 21:34:52 SOUL OF CANADA MURDERED BY GREED: Fake eggs, Fake rice produced in factories, not farms and fake milk, olive oil filled Canadian markets. Canadians can't think of genuine food. Criminals with Dual Citizenships corrupted society like Hitlers Germany for Gold & Money. Up in Arms.
1143 2018-09-13 21:34:50 You just sabi...I go dey follow u up till death do us apart..
#nohomo
1144 2018-09-13 21:34:37 It’s obvious they just want oil.
1145 2018-09-13 21:34:33 use coconut oil
1146 2018-09-13 21:34:26 Yeah cuz building a website is just as difficult as drilling for oil.
1147 2018-09-13 21:34:20 I am happy tonight. Feel light in my spirit. Haven't done in a while, so I am thankful to God for his oil of gladness! Also thankful for a circle of mindful loving friends. 
#blessed
1148 2018-09-13 21:33:56 Chicken Thigh... but with  Potato

  1/3  lb of  Chicken Thigh,  Ground 
  1 1/4  cup of  Potato,  Diced 
  1  cup of  Dill 

 Marinate  Chicken Thigh in 1 cup Olive Oil and  Dill for 1 hour. 
 Roast  Chicken Thigh in oven at 375F until cooked. 
 Serve hot. 

 Don't burn it!
1149 2018-09-13 21:33:50 DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE FUNDS CAME FROM? OBVIOUSLY NOT. THEY COULDNT BE USED FOR HURRICANE. CORRUPT PR GOV’T IS CORRUPT AND PROBLEM HAS BEEN MANY YEARS. YOU SHOWING YOUR IGNORANCE. THE SQUEAKY WHEEL GETS THE OIL.
1150 2018-09-13 21:33:37 Got involved with CBD oil to help people. The stories are eye opening. Benefits are amazing. @purebodyzen #naturalmedicine #farmtobottle #purebodyzenteam
1151 2018-09-13 21:33:35 No, we don't oppose pipelines because we want oil to move by rail. We want the oil to be left in the ground where it formed, so we oppose making it easier and more profitable to extract and burn it.  Makes more sense now, no?
1152 2018-09-13 21:33:26 Oil up the Printer 
1153 2018-09-13 21:33:09 Coffee + CBD oil = limitless drug
1154 2018-09-13 21:32:54 Struggeling with that one. Bunker oil is cheap, and short usage time + lots of effect drives up costs for port charger infrastructure. But still coming in more and more ports over here (Oslo, Bergen, Kristiansand and many other ports)
1155 2018-09-13 21:32:40 ...a lack of government assistance. If we compare to the huge subsidies we give the oil industry, for instance, craft brewers are charging ahead with little help. I just don't see the point in giving Doug any credit when he hasn't *done* anything. 
1156 2018-09-13 21:32:29 We don't know much of him back then. cos we were kids then. But what we do knew is he has no foreign account, no oil well, no house in Abj
1157 2018-09-13 21:32:25 Always remember to the change the oil in your time machine once every 6 months or 3,000 years.
1158 2018-09-13 21:32:19 Just when you think you got enough with Hoffman and you proceed to ship him and grab something better... tough summer to be an oil fan. Loser prediction but I say Sharks and Leafs in the final this year.
1159 2018-09-13 21:32:12 pls come TRUE: REALLY WANTS AHMADS PARMESAN OLIVE OIL PASTA
1160 2018-09-13 21:32:12 He started with the relief cream just to see how it was. It helped almost instantly but now hes taking the oil and its having a more lasting effect.
1161 2018-09-13 21:31:45 But why ? He pees oil, that's funny because I can...FIRE HIM WHEN HE PEES BY HIS PEE 8D
1162 2018-09-13 21:31:44 Just another reason these oil pipelines are no good
1163 2018-09-13 21:31:29 I can smell incompetence all over the article. $172 billion for what, GDP or cash realized from oil?
1164 2018-09-13 21:31:23 patiently waiting for a reliable source of oil
1165 2018-09-13 21:31:11 Note shown: Plate of Chicken Parm + sauted asparahus lightly covered in olive oil - JK
1166 2018-09-13 21:31:10 Idk but I do, almost always. I think it usually feels kinda cheaply sensuous? "The rich smell of garlic filled the room, as she stirred the cloves into the spattering oil," or some such
1167 2018-09-13 21:31:05 You guys put your mf oil into my pond again and I swear Imma call my cousins and we gone let loose all everyone’s cars
1168 2018-09-13 21:30:46 Combine 11 lbs Squid  with 1/3 cup ginger. Mix in Olive Oil. Roast. Serve for brunch
1169 2018-09-13 21:30:33 All the more reason to get Canadian oil to world markets.

1171 2018-09-13 21:30:21 I got a whole $30.00 a month tax cut, and my heating oil doubled, and gas doubled, and now I am in the hole.  So angry I had to cancel my yacht.  #GOPtaxcam #TheResistanceVotes

1173 2018-09-13 21:30:11 Need mre coconut oil :(
1174 2018-09-13 21:30:09 No matter who #NewYork elects this election cycle, the sad news is we have lost this great state.  It is already, admittedly, anti conservative, the Governor himself @andrewcuomo  told us there was no place in NY for our beliefs. This election won't change NY We are doomed
1175 2018-09-13 21:30:00 Unpunishable 4: Oil Panic in Tennessee!
1176 2018-09-13 21:29:53 Getting a oil change!
1177 2018-09-13 21:29:50 I tried Valerian Root, Xanax and Benadryl for anxiety they all worked differently the only one that consistently works to put me to sleep but not make me out of it the next day is Benadryl. on a CBD oil regiment daily for pain, it doesn't seem to do anything for sleep msg 4 deets
1178 2018-09-13 21:29:49 And tight supplies... Benchmark Bent Crude oil: down 79 cents, a barrel, at $79.14, 0830... US historic crude oil: $1.15, low: $69.22 a barrel... oil market tightening at market, world oil demand at 100 million... currency depriciability vs. US dollars
1179 2018-09-13 21:29:37 Lord, bestow upon me the motivation to get this frikken' oil pan off.
1180 2018-09-13 21:29:31 Just start with flintstones chewables and work your way up to fish oil and BCAA
1181 2018-09-13 21:29:27 Survived for over 100yrs before the oil money so don't get your hopes up mate sorry 
1182 2018-09-13 21:29:26 Did you even read the article though? They want his admin to stop approving oil drilling permits of which they have approved 20k since he took office and most are in POC communities. You don’t think this is worth protesting?  It’s sounds pretty logical to me
1183 2018-09-13 21:29:23 Lmao  it looks like Yoruba stew with plenty oil and pepper
1184 2018-09-13 21:29:21 The dealership should not take an hour to change my oil, especially when I had an appt and nobody ahead of me. Thanks for being soooo considerate of peoples’ time, mechanics.
1185 2018-09-13 21:29:10 mustard oil bbygal 
1186 2018-09-13 21:29:09 Im guessing PRAYING just isnt enough
Sco Mo needs to take Midnight Oil onboard, and believe
God come down and save me
1187 2018-09-13 21:29:07 I was gonna say young stolen oil filters and extension cord dog leashes but I relented. LOL
1188 2018-09-13 21:29:05 put tea tree oil on my nipple piercings n i’m feeling hella minty
1189 2018-09-13 21:28:59 whoever hair I'm wearing don't go good wit this weather at oil
1190 2018-09-13 21:28:52 lemon juice lightens dark spots! also try emu oil it’s like the closest thing to human skin it really tones it, i’ve been using it!
1191 2018-09-13 21:28:48 Anyone else have any experience with CBD oil and whether or not it helps with pain? I'm trying my first bath bomb with 300mg CBD and I'd like to know your thoughts if you've used it in any form. 
1192 2018-09-13 21:28:45 I’m running a lil Magic Face Oil giveaway on the Instagram page of my hustle (no longer really SIDE, more like MAIN) folk potions. So go to IG, look up folk potions and get something for free to little work.
1193 2018-09-13 21:28:38 The Indy ref1campaign was based on the oil?
1194 2018-09-13 21:28:30 2/ Canadian oil needs to get out of the oversupplied NA market. KM couldn't litigate its way to getting TMX going. Hence the government's Crown corporation purchase of KM Canada. Sure, the court has delivered a hitch, but so have the courts in the US. /3

1199 2018-09-13 21:27:45 Gardein’s chik’n stripes are good too if you cook them in oil (otherwise they are mushy ) i cook tofu in the airfryer and it gets nice and crispy!!
1200 2018-09-13 21:27:43 The extinction of our species isn't going to be because we burn coal and oil!
1201 2018-09-13 21:27:26 Lol excellent retort. You must have debate champ in high school and college. I'm doing just fine with my masters in engineering. This is why dems control most universities, law, media, science, medicine, arts, finance. You guys are great at crops and digging oil wells though
1202 2018-09-13 21:27:26 i really wish i was going to the indy show because lucas oil is my home but i also gotta see the goo goo dolls man

1204 2018-09-13 21:27:15 Tbf, your username triggers them to death
1205 2018-09-13 21:27:03 The "economic climate" is a direct result of the oil industry developing the means to tap shale oil. Sure, Canada has shale, but the US has it in spades. As a result, we have a NA supply glut and consequent decline in oil prices beginning in mid-2014.../2
1206 2018-09-13 21:26:58 no matter what happens, you'll always have a lucrative co-ed oil wrestling career to fall back on.
1207 2018-09-13 21:26:43 He wanted no advertising for any competitor of Pure/Union/Unocal gas & oil products and especially disliked oil treatment advertising - the thought being his motor oil needed no additive.
1208 2018-09-13 21:26:28 getting my oil changed actually at the mileage I’m supposed to tomorrow... I really have my shit together wow
1209 2018-09-13 21:26:23 Irrelevant to namjin

1210 2018-09-13 21:26:18 I’m slicker than an oil spill, she say she won’t, but I bet she will. 
1211 2018-09-13 21:26:11 Well that's not going to happen if we turn our backs on the people most vulnerable to the coal and oil industries.
1212 2018-09-13 21:26:04 At least dog owners pick it up in blue plastic bag (made from oil). Me ..I'm sticking with my two cats!
1213 2018-09-13 21:26:00 Have better things to do. City can curl up and die for all I care. And they will once the Oil guys get bored...
1214 2018-09-13 21:25:57 For funsies I decided to look into Darnell nurses stats to try to figure out what I would pay him. I found a fun stat that is in my humble opinion very underrated. Nurse played 82 games last year. The only oil dman to do it. #oilers
1215 2018-09-13 21:25:55 Same in FL. I refuse to affiliate with a major party while they're playing oil and water. 

Needs more ranked voting to rid ourselves of diabolical fringe.

1221 2018-09-13 21:25:35 No, I'm not a fan of butter. I only use it when I cook veal which is very infrequently (though I do have a plan to cook it for someone in 2 weeks)

Super hot pan

Steak rested at room temp for an hour covered in olive oil, salt and pepper. Cook for 35 seconds, turn, 35 seconds 
1222 2018-09-13 21:25:23 With regard to the environment, oil/gas companies create the problem that scientists try to solve.
So, the money means different things to them.
Corporations = profits & shareholder value
Scientists = research and solutions
1223 2018-09-13 21:25:12 What ideas have we even heard Buhari espouse since "low oil prices are not acceptable"?
1224 2018-09-13 21:24:49 People in the rural areas are also in a "bubble", and they're not a monolith.  For many, the loss of STC was a game changer.  Corporate farming and oil extraction don't define Saskatchewan.  #skpoli #cdnpoli
1225 2018-09-13 21:24:41 Sharpen and oil mine everyday!
1226 2018-09-13 21:24:33 I feel like every other month I get a oil change, when I don’t even go nowhere. Damn time flies
1227 2018-09-13 21:24:18 What about the price of oil increasing per barrel.
1228 2018-09-13 21:23:44 Please can CMs be posted to oil companies like NNPC?

1231 2018-09-13 21:23:22 . This is what I’ve been doing since yesterday. Put a few drops of essential oil like eucalyptus oil or our liquid Chinese rub in a handkerchief close to your nose or on your ear lobe, your temple, the nape of your neck and your forehead before u sleep and also on ur feet
1232 2018-09-13 21:23:22 this old white lady walked past me in HEB and was like “you smell amazing,  what scent is that???” and i had to kindly tell her it was just baby oil
1233 2018-09-13 21:23:14 Don’t be surprised to see a lot more oil being imported Russian. Trump is wrecking trade and treaties to benefit his puppet master Putin. Trump works for Russia and does not care about America or its people. #impeachTrump

1237 2018-09-13 21:22:56 Overheard at #GCAS2018 by an oil executive:

- climate lawsuits are inevitable
- carbon pricing is inevitable
- climate risk scenario planning is mandatory 
- financial materiality is present

Can a post-carbon world be far behind?

1247 2018-09-13 21:21:38 There's also track space somewhere in the n'hood because they stored a lot of IL/WI/MN frac sand cars and ND crude oil cars when those markets took a hit a couple of years ago.

1252 2018-09-13 21:20:50 I see where you're coming from. But consider that it would be more fixed compared to fuel which is dependent on fluctuations such as Commidity (oil) prices and Volitile Currency movements.
1253 2018-09-13 21:20:20 That's, great to hear. Don't you think it would be a good idea to amend your packaging to let consumers know this ... I didn't buy your biscuits because I wasn't aware your palm oil was sustainable and certified. Ps is your chocolate fair trade :)
1254 2018-09-13 21:20:14 Exactly the same thing in Alberta and BC, Canada.

Here the dynamics are around oil pipelines (quid) and carbon pricing (pro quo).
1255 2018-09-13 21:20:02 When i smoke Togo weed, i usually count the number of palm oil used after pouring it into the pot i used for cooking
But when i take Nigeria weed, i walk down to the barbing saloon get a hair cut and start counting the number of hairs being cut out from my head after barb
1256 2018-09-13 21:19:21 ughh i need an oil change :(
1257 2018-09-13 21:19:15 If you give in now, it will never stop. Then it will be an oil change. Then it'll scream for new tires, brakes. Never ends. Stand firm!
1258 2018-09-13 21:19:08 No his point is Canda has the best, most regulated oil and gas in the world. She should have been promoting that since day one when millions of dollars starting being divested out of Alberta. Where does he say they didn’t do it until “now”. He said “eleventh hour” considering the
1259 2018-09-13 21:19:04 in my first 20 mins of gameplay i kicked a thug into burning oil spilt from a car crash and watched him burn for a while

1264 2018-09-13 21:18:32 Yes, a true friend of Syrian terrorists. Am the other parts of Syria that's already liberated are back to normal life, yet you love terrorists. Maybe it's because once liberated, the US no longer has an excuse to be in Syria and give back Syrian oil fields?
1265 2018-09-13 21:18:31 Sounds like a squeaky clean 5 year Navy veteran officer who has absolutely nothing to hide from Congress and an intelligence agency that wiretapped him TWICE in 3 years and tried their best to nail him for cavorting with Russian oil executives.
James fucking Bond 
1266 2018-09-13 21:18:09 I was cooking in a swimsuit and splashed hot oil on myself now I’ve got two burns on my stomach.....

1270 2018-09-13 21:17:40 So it means that some US refiners running now aggressively at 110-120% (comparing to those who're running now conservatively at 80-90%) are betting on short- or mid-term upside in oil product prices. Sounds reasonable for me.
1271 2018-09-13 21:17:38 Coffee is the second most traded commodity on Earth after oil.
1272 2018-09-13 21:17:38 @GloWorld you're the most useless network provider ever Known to mankind, your Sim is getting out of my phone ATM and never ever coming back.
Useless people.
1273 2018-09-13 21:17:30 Scare? So so the people pushing generators right now do it to scare people? Or because it’s smart when you’re about to go through a hurricane. How about any other wise investment. Life insurance. Oil changes. Any number of smart things to buy. A gun happens to be one of them.

1277 2018-09-13 21:17:17 Is it Chiaurlish of me to remind fellow Oiler fans that the guy we have to count on to build a team around McGod traded Taylor AND Tyler within 3 years of each other?? (And that the Oil D is still average at best??) Magic beans, anyone?? #Oilers #tyler #Seguin
1278 2018-09-13 21:17:09 Time to start buying stocks from the oil companies!
1279 2018-09-13 21:17:08 if it gets in her eye at all i promise it's harmless!! As long it's like natural coconut oil. Are use it to remove my make up all the time and drench my eyes in it & it never bothers at all
1280 2018-09-13 21:17:01 how about if you don't do your work you will fail..If it's school work...If it's like washing dishesThese dishes ain't cleaning themselves
1281 2018-09-13 21:16:53 Please acknowledge that when clean energy replaces oil, coal, and gas, the economy will do better.  We need fracking banned, neighborhoods free of oil and gas sites (including the unsafe #AlisoCanyon which is sickening 1000s of northern Los Angeles residents).
1282 2018-09-13 21:16:38 Your action is simply taxation and stopping the flow of oil and the prosperity of this country. Oh ya and banning straws. Total disgrace to call yourself a Canadian.
1283 2018-09-13 21:16:34 Usually Gabe’s room is musky and gross but lately it’s been smelling kinda nice so I was like wow your room hasn’t been smelling too badly lately and he was like oh yeah I’ve been JOing with coconut oil lately it makes my room smell good lol

whole korean olive oil with bacon. . .23
1287 2018-09-13 21:16:08 They are going to need a lot of gun oil and fluffy rolls of paper towels if they are going to pull it off. And diapers. And life rafts. And swim fins. And . . .
1288 2018-09-13 21:16:02 Im gone be at this dealership all day just for a damn oil change...
1289 2018-09-13 21:16:01 I still think we can do what they did in the second Back to the Future movie and use our trash as fuel.  Fix two things at once: the oil shortage and overflowing landfills.
1290 2018-09-13 21:15:50 Yes, I crushed up high protein dog food and I mixed it with olive oil.  My girls look great now.
1291 2018-09-13 21:15:44 AKA, we are colluding on oil prices.
1292 2018-09-13 21:15:42 Imagine being an oil company still charging insane rates for gasoline for evacuees @Shell @exxonmobil @BP_plc

Last time Waters had a policy was back in 2009 when she told oil executives that the Gov't wants to Socialize their industry.
1295 2018-09-13 21:15:23 I’ve been overflowing with oil until I bought a ton of food lol

1301 2018-09-13 21:14:39 Scotland wouldn't be in any debt if it hadn't had its oil nicked by Westminster
1302 2018-09-13 21:14:37 The oil heating biz has often used these events to scare people from using gas.
1303 2018-09-13 21:14:34 I just took CBD oil for the first time and Pete Holmes was right my body feels way more relaxed it's really letting me melt into this panic attack.
1304 2018-09-13 21:14:33 Yep.  CBC happy to use him to blather on about oil or whatever, but they NEVER have talked about the dumpster fire he left behind in SK.  SFL President @LHubich is retiring, now would be a great time to talk to him.  But I won't hold my breath. #cdnpoli #skpoli
1305 2018-09-13 21:14:24 I got a foolproof plan to bolster flagging global trade. Wait for it... a hearty @$%& you to sanctions!

"Yo North Korea, I gots some B2 bombers on layaway. Limited time offer. Founders edition just 100 mil extra. We take Iranian oil too. Hit me up bro."
1306 2018-09-13 21:14:13 I am equally an oil tycoon and nasty slut when I’m on matcha
1307 2018-09-13 21:14:12 Sad to see if true. USA still buys oil from Iran and always has since sanctions were imposed 30 years ago. Just corrupt world
1308 2018-09-13 21:14:10 so gorgeous!! i struggle w oil lmao
1309 2018-09-13 21:13:55 I would imagine majority of the cargo that comes into and out of here would be oil/gas related...

1311 2018-09-13 21:13:33 I bake aubergine slices marinated in seaweed, oil & a little salt & lemon then dip in batter & fry for vegan 'fish'.
1312 2018-09-13 21:13:30 I want a full body massage w oil.. candles lit. lights low. Music on
1313 2018-09-13 21:13:16 These pastors go kill me. We dey pray there norr he start dey shout "He's here!" I got frightened. "It must be an evil spirit." only for the pastor to yell again "The assistant pastor is here with the anointing oil!" I passed out.
1314 2018-09-13 21:12:58 Once when my kid was a toddler he had a massive meltdown in the grocery parking lot because he thought vegetable oil was juice and he was screaming "JUICE!" and grabbing at the bottle of it and we were both frustrated and crying.
1315 2018-09-13 21:12:44 There will be a spike in $120 per bottle beard oil.
1316 2018-09-13 21:12:29 someone: has a problem 
jenna marbles: coconut oil
1317 2018-09-13 21:12:28 It’s almost impossible for the average person to keep up with all these new increases. Gas, oil, groceries, and now prescriptions are at an all time high.These millionaires don’t see people anymore, they see cash cows to fill their bank accounts.They just don’t care
1318 2018-09-13 21:12:22 I haven't beaten Oil Ocean, and then spend the tiny quantities
1319 2018-09-13 21:12:02 Hi how are you? I have a question in @agilyx convert plastic to fuel oil? Thank you so much
1320 2018-09-13 21:11:52 Jetpack technology exists, but the reptiles hoard it for themselves! Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, a philosopher stone, and an iMac! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
1321 2018-09-13 21:11:44 Electricity and transportation are entirely dependant on oil/coal for their production.  You cannot make a battery car without without mining and processing.

1325 2018-09-13 21:11:23 I keep avocado oil, black peppercorn and Himalayan pink sea salt on me.
1326 2018-09-13 21:11:22 Are we looking into possibilities of offshore oil exploration and drilling? India has been drilling off Mumbai, it is likely that we might find oil offshore Pakistan sector too.
1327 2018-09-13 21:11:15 Yup - we need to add "Train" to the $TSLA "big" enemies list: Big Oil, Big Auto, Big Shorties and now, Big Train.

No doubt all of them are in cahoots as a "mega" cartel to stop the mission towards a sustainable future!
1328 2018-09-13 21:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: raw crust with sweet coconut oil and arugula.

1335 2018-09-13 21:10:01 Love this!  Love the activists who actually care about the health of those of us who live near #AlisoCanyon, Wilmington, Carson, DTLA, & other neighborhoods threatened by oil & gas drilling & storage.
1336 2018-09-13 21:09:57 I write Same as any financial journo’ I tell it as it is. Tis a biggy placing #ANGS trying for £5/6M Understand this: these companies are frauds. They don’t produce oil they produce worthless ‘Confetti Shares’ 2 keep their lifestyles going. Therein lies the key to not getting hit

1339 2018-09-13 21:09:49 Then I read "Fish, Flax, and Borage Oil" on a medicine bottle & thought it said "Bondage Oil"
1340 2018-09-13 21:09:40 Dan druff is from dry skin, need to moisturize n get the oil back in your scalp. Wash and condition it once every few days, if it dont improve pick up some hair oil, leave it on for a bit then rinse off. Could also be pserriosis but typically its from shit shampoo n over washing
1341 2018-09-13 21:09:30 Oh for the days when olive oil was for pouring down your ears , not drizzling on your beetroot salad ?

An ass wipers for her bday
1345 2018-09-13 21:08:48 And I would rather give the money to farmers than give it to Iran like former President Obama....and how about all the subsidies the democrats gave for ethanol that doesnt make us any less reliant on oil
1346 2018-09-13 21:08:32 The #BrownsLastChance protesters at #GCAS18 today live next to the oil wells @JerryBrownGov refuses to shut down and the facilities CA cap & trade allows to keep polluting. They do not view him as a climate leader.

1348 2018-09-13 21:08:23 Mud, grease, oil, chemicals, and blood if they're unlucky.
1349 2018-09-13 21:08:21 50%?! Are you kidding? How will I pay for my hyperbaric oxygen chamber and my essential oil vaporizers?
1350 2018-09-13 21:08:06 I am not against MMJ. however, this meme isn’t factual. She was arrested for manufacturing thc oil and her kid doesn’t have a chronic disease. She treats her Crohn’s disease with it. She did one year of probation.
1351 2018-09-13 21:08:04 Great week today as the 8th Graders worked in small groups to determine the effects of various everyday liquids on pennies.  It was interesting to see the effects of saliva on oil.
1352 2018-09-13 21:08:03 Before inkor? U think say grown man go willingly pour oil for body Just like that? 
1353 2018-09-13 21:07:58 We HAVE to decrease oil/gas consumption, eventually,  There is a limited supply.  But as GWB said, 'we are addicted to oil' and that is our life style of having things made out of steel.  I don't see the necessary effort to get us into options like hydrogen.
1354 2018-09-13 21:07:57 And makes possible most of the $10 billion a year Quebec receives in federal equalization payments.  I don't know how we ever talked them in to accepting such dirty oil money with them being such environmental purists!
1355 2018-09-13 21:07:45 Have you ever looked into the benefits of medical marajuana oil combined with a neutral diet( no processed food, red meat etc) and juicing to keep up the body's defences. Lots of info on internet. Just a thought.
1356 2018-09-13 21:07:37 is this oil or acrylic paint? :0
1357 2018-09-13 21:07:22 #BestWayToAWomansHeart is to be a man that can change my oil literally & figuratively.
1358 2018-09-13 21:07:22 Memang ada devisa dr lifting crude oil tp yg TDK dijelaskan Kemenkeu adalah kenaikan uang yg sama yg hrs dikeluarkan Krn import BBM ...
1359 2018-09-13 21:07:20 America surpasses Russia and Saudi Arabia as the largest global crude oil producer. Fantastic...must be thanks to #Obama right? #ThursdayThoughts
1360 2018-09-13 21:06:59 Theres no such thing as "fossil fuel". Hydrocarbons are an infinite supply. Every country can be oil independent if they had the infrastructure. OPEC and US oil cartels (rockefellers) created the illusion of a limited supply in order to monopolize global market. Russia found out.
1361 2018-09-13 21:06:55 了解
1362 2018-09-13 21:06:41 They are going to need a lot of gun oil and fluffy rolls of paper towels if they are going to pull it off. And diapers. And life rafts. And swim fins. And . . .

1369 2018-09-13 21:05:38 Go and see the billions Chinese people make from our resources (oil excluded) monthly while we live in penury. we don’t even know the value of those resources. Fucking monkeys 
1370 2018-09-13 21:05:32 What I'm I missing
1371 2018-09-13 21:05:30 My coconut oil leaked all over the stuff I bought in my shopping bag 
1372 2018-09-13 21:05:06 I'm the road? The oil is therapy? The chips are my copay?
1373 2018-09-13 21:05:03 I think he means compared to when they were elected and pretty anti oil and gas.
1374 2018-09-13 21:04:18 He furrowed his brow. Dallying with the serving girl a handful of times didn’t make him close to Collette. 

Even though it was completely expected, Claude’s sting of disapproval felt like hot oil dumped on his skin.

“I was assured that it was a thorough investigation and +
1375 2018-09-13 21:04:04 Free buses in how many local government? Building schools while there are less teacher to teach the students.  Even the working teachers were being owed salary of several months. The result of his mediocre impact on education is yet to be seen.A whole oil producing state.
1376 2018-09-13 21:04:03 Painkillers have had no effect. Clove oil is somewhat helping. Just need to sleep 
1377 2018-09-13 21:03:58 静香と一緒に居れるし運動不足も回収できるとか一石二鳥どころじゃない
1378 2018-09-13 21:03:56 His point is they were seen as an anti oil and gas party and have now almost totally flipped realizing how unpopular they are among Albertans. Relatively speaking a couple months is the “eleventh hour.”
1379 2018-09-13 21:03:23 Also in unrelated news, CBD oil is GREAT.
1380 2018-09-13 21:03:23 Literally: to sell oil
1381 2018-09-13 21:03:20 Omg I was suppose to be getting an oil change but I was sleep instead
1382 2018-09-13 21:03:14 eucalyptus!! couch drops, oil, literally anything eucalyptus. if your nose is blocked, pour the oil onto a tissue and leave it by your bedside and in the morning you’ll be clear
1383 2018-09-13 21:03:12 Tell the Democrats to trot this person out, and American can judge her story from approximately 1982...
1384 2018-09-13 21:03:02 Not producing oil makes people pollute less too.
1385 2018-09-13 21:02:59 Funny I see that you are from Ontario. Gave you ever considered diversifying there? I mean its just that simple right diversify and save the economy why hasnt any district without oil and gas thought of this?
1386 2018-09-13 21:02:55 Vissing I hate to do it to you but the Colts all time win percentage while calling the RCA Dome home is .523  during Lucas Oil era it’s .548
1387 2018-09-13 21:02:55 Yay! We are so happy you love this amazing oil!
1388 2018-09-13 21:02:42 try washing it less and use conditioner more and less shampoo. make sure your shampoo and conditioner has no sulfate. and also put coconut oil in your hair and leave it in for about 30 mins or sleep with it in overnight it makes it healthier and thicker
1389 2018-09-13 21:02:41 How long does it take to change my Jeeps oil??? It’s been forever

1391 2018-09-13 21:02:32 Cooking oil!
1392 2018-09-13 21:02:26 Wait, are the cons saying they finally caved and want to nationalize the oil sands and created a crown refinery in alberta?

Oh.

No, they mean cuts taxes, deregulate, and let American oil barons own more stuff.

Pity, I thought they stopped failing for once.
1393 2018-09-13 21:02:14 Ryan, Ontario has benefited greatly from Alberta's resource sector as the rest of the country has. Your pain is also our pain. I understand how your great Province must be feeling...the worlds second largest oil reserve blocked by a few left wing anarchists. We will fix this.
1394 2018-09-13 21:01:58 Not sure what open borders have to do with energy issues. Even if your perspectives on industry and agriculture are correct, it still leaves many areas, including electricity, transportation and housing as areas for transitions. We can significantly decrease oil/gas consumption.
1395 2018-09-13 21:01:57 Or better still, the forests, which are being mined for candy bar’s palm oil and not replaced, football fields each day. Please use your popularity for helping #saveourforests 
Stand up, Alec, we need you for more than donations!
1396 2018-09-13 21:01:53 Every Wilkes-Barre guy ever: I saved $2000 and just got an oil change, let’s move across the country.
1397 2018-09-13 21:01:45 Vitamin E and/or evening primrose oil! 
1398 2018-09-13 21:01:44 Do these figures include Scotlands 'share' of its own oil revenue or the revenue it would have had if it was Independant for all those years?
1399 2018-09-13 21:01:43 Someone hook me up with oil

1401 2018-09-13 21:01:29 I like Isa Moskowitz’s tofu ricotta recipe (firm tofu, olive oil, nutritional yeast, salt, other flavoring like lemon juice, garlic, nutmeg, I also use it in place of Parmesan for pesto
1402 2018-09-13 21:01:15 Dilbit is simply a type of heavy oil. It behaves like other heavy oils when spilled. Until you can understand this simple point there is nothing the rest of us can do to help you.
1403 2018-09-13 21:01:07 Our forebears had to break up Standard Oil and telephony monopolies. We need to break up Amazon and Google. They are so big they cannot be regulated and they are corrupting our democratic systems which are there to make Capitalism serve the people, not the super rich

1405 2018-09-13 21:00:54 Okay but I need a man who can change my oil so I don’t have to pay for it.
1406 2018-09-13 21:00:48 The Prophet also told me that they are also setting very huge  oil storage. That's one thing that Kenya lacks unlike Russia and Israel that have huge storages that can last a whole year without replenishing
1407 2018-09-13 21:00:35 I'm not proficient in refinery capacity utilization rates (fact/nameplate) but in petrochemicals it's possible to run at 110-120%. Is this possible in oil refineries? Maybe some US refiners run at higher than ~94-96% rate? 110-120%?
1408 2018-09-13 21:00:33 Who sells Mid or mid related accessories (ex: oil carts)???????????
1409 2018-09-13 21:00:32 Your selling military equipment to any Allie who has significant oil reserves and is conducting a clear Cold War against Iran for control of the Arab peninsula. Why would care if children, hospitals and schools are bombed as collateral damage?

1413 2018-09-13 21:00:18 If the US did not need us do you think they would have been spending all this time negotiating? Keep in mind our trade with the US is larger than all the other countries combined. Oh and we have that little thing called oil and water
1414 2018-09-13 21:00:13 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats

1419 2018-09-13 20:59:56 Lord Welby attended Eton and Cambridge and worked as an oil industry executive for eleven years. His speech is the type of hypocrisy that drips from the lips of Labour closet-capitalists and champagne socialists like Sir Keir Starmer, Lady Nugee, Lord Mandelson and Lord Adonis.
1420 2018-09-13 20:59:44 there is a lady sitting nearby that looks like she just spent the last 3 months either in a tanning bed or sitting on some shitty ass beach with spf 2 tanning oil on, and i gotta say that definitely aint it chief

1423 2018-09-13 20:59:28 They made a profit of 10million, that's awful for a Premier League elite club, without the oil rich backers and strategic loop holes like putting 90% of the club staff wage bill into the sister company City would be flat broke!!!! #fakeriches
1424 2018-09-13 20:59:18 Maybe it's because @JerryBrownGov accepted $9 million from the oil & gas industry, or because his administration approved >20K new oil & gas facilities, and >70% of them are in low-income/nonwhite communities./1
1425 2018-09-13 20:59:14 We have our Oil of Egg ready and bottled.

1431 2018-09-13 20:58:17 It removes excess oil from your hair. You should still probably clean your head normally, every once in a while.

1441 2018-09-13 20:56:26 You’d have to use them topically. There is some truth to plants having microbial attributes. Like tea tree oil. Will it kill all? No, but plants have been around for forever so there is some validity for certain instances.

1448 2018-09-13 20:55:57 Get over it.  That has got to be the most obtuse answer ever.  I guess all the have not regions of this once great country better get used to a lot less money being dolled out.  When The oil and gas sector struggles, the entire country does.  That is a proven fact.

1473 2018-09-13 20:52:33 no...I do believe in taking care of one's self, but just some shea butter (as a base coat) & coconut oil (spot detail) isn't a big deal and goes such a long way. I'm all about being young at heart and never fake, when I'm old I won't front...in this life I'm 31 years young

1491 2018-09-13 20:50:51 That's an interesting lighthouse built on an oil rig base.  While it kinda sorta looks like a frying pan, it's named after Frying Pan Shoals off of Cape Fear, NC.

It was built in the 60's to take over from a series of lightships that had been on station there for over 100 years.
1492 2018-09-13 20:50:50 The only way you can get on the beach at Benidorm in the summer is to cover yourself in oil so you can slide between all the people there and if you make it into the water hard luck you need to wait till night when everyone is gone to get out.
1493 2018-09-13 20:50:29 Have you tried CBD oil? There are studies out there now showing it doesn’t affect unborn babies and is a fantastic natural main management option. I went through spinal surgery recently and using CBD throughout my recovery has been a god send.

1497 2018-09-13 20:50:03 Actually, my favorite way to cook them is to sautee’ them in olive oil, with salt and pepper. Pull the chops, add a sliced onion and a little garlic. Deglaze with wine. Add a can or 2 of tomatoes plus mushrooms, olives, artichokes, etc. Eat.
1498 2018-09-13 20:50:01 I think market will find it more difficult to fulfill imo with Iran out. I know our guys are looking at multiple ways to try and increase distillate yield or o.5% fuel oil.

1499 2018-09-13 20:50:00 Did you have it with coconut oil?
1500 2018-09-13 20:49:59 In the beginning it's a challenge because relaxing your hair is seen as the 'easy' thing. So generally its hard to find a variety of options of products. I started treating it home myself. Basic coconut/caster oil mixes. Just be patient and also give it TLC.

1514 2018-09-13 20:47:30 This legislation simply takes Oil & Gas revenue from the general fund and dedicates it to maintenance. It doesn't "solve" anything in the sense that it merely takes money from the left pocket and puts it in the right pocket. #NotUTValues #utpol #BadAtMath #BadAtAccounting

1524 2018-09-13 20:46:32 We don't chose to send our federal tax dollars to Washington, it is required.  In return we expect the full support of our federal government.  We also are the base for our military in the Pacific.  We receive most of our consumables, including oil and gas, via air and sea.

1529 2018-09-13 20:45:55 Thank you Don true FACTS,he has to understand Russia started becoming stable and developing in 2000 when president Putin came to power.Europe depends on Russian gas ,and has massive untapped gas and oil in Siberia ,so with time and Trump craziness all is possible !

1534 2018-09-13 20:45:47 Dischem has a Witch hazel toner, it does the things ( even stings like alcohol when you faka it ) but if your skin is sensitive, then get one infused w oil bc it can be a bit drying.
1535 2018-09-13 20:45:46 Coffee with grass fed butter and mtc oil mixed in. Some nutritional BS Jorge, you know me, I don’t really know what’s going on 
1536 2018-09-13 20:45:43 I turned away. “It’s paint. I was painting this morning.” It’s not oil. It’s the exact colour of your hair. “I can’t believe I left the house covered in paint.”
“It’s not … you’re not covered. There’s just a little bit,” he said. “Easily missed. I can—”

1540 2018-09-13 20:45:03 “dozens of technologies to clean up a heavy oil spill in the open ocean”. 

First.. Heavy oil can be a lot of things & you used that word deliberately. We are talking about Dilbit.

Second... you linked an article instead of the specific tech used to clean up Dilbit in the ocean

1547 2018-09-13 20:44:41 You must have missed the news the economy is better than it ever was durin Obama,unemployment rate down,more open jobs than people looking for work,less people on food stamps,trade deals being renegotiated to benefit U.S. more,largest oil producer,tax cuts,wages are up,GDP up....

1549 2018-09-13 20:44:35 USA is producing more oil than ever to decrease the oil prices in order to destroy China's economy. China is so dependent on oil prices because it lent and invested Africa, South America where oil  reserve countries located such as Venezuela. China's economy is also dependent on

1571 2018-09-13 20:40:23 Science is clear that can't happen and economics is quickly moving in the same direction. Technology exists to transition quite quickly. The issue is that Canada has a deep oil state that controls the Cons, Libs and to a large extent the NDP as well.

1574 2018-09-13 20:40:14 Almost as soon as Zinke touched down in the Sunshine State, Florida was exempted from the sweeping effort to open U.S. waters to oil and gas drilling. Drilling would still be banned off Florida's coast.

1598 2018-09-13 20:37:57 I dunno what rights have to do with it, you have a “right” to buy whatever the state says it’s legal to buy, you don’t have a right to buy oil from Iran for the simple reason that the state says you don’t.
1599 2018-09-13 20:37:53 coconut oil, castor oil, argan/Morocco oil or even vitamin e oil!

1607 2018-09-13 20:37:11 If we wait we fail. Energy companies will gladly wait for all of the coal, oil,and gas to be exhausted before retrofitting their infrastructure. We need new thinking  from new places.

1643 2018-09-13 20:32:16 If you were an actual Alaskan, and not a shill from outside, you would know the ANWR is more complex than that.  ANWR, in the long run is more valuable as a reserve, not as an oil field.  But you have to know Alaska better to understand that.
1644 2018-09-13 20:31:57 Hmm. I wonder if there's a relationship between production of thermal coal and oil & gas, and disdain for anything that limits carbon emissions? Perhaps the USA plans to curtail C emissions only after it has sucked the last drop of oil from the ground?

1654 2018-09-13 20:30:50 I notice these “activists” are wearing clothes and glasses that they chose to purchase (capitalism) and I’m certain other items they use on a daily basis were manufactured by machines that use oil.
1655 2018-09-13 20:30:46 Combine 8 oz cereal with 1/3 cup Rice. Blend with Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve in 3 inch slices
1656 2018-09-13 20:30:45 Your ideas are not researched and will do more damage to the climate than help. 90% of our electricity is renewable sop installing solar takes money away from this. Solar panels have a life of 25years.. So you waste all that oil that went into making them and cause more rubbish
1657 2018-09-13 20:30:37 When I look back I feel too skinny. I'm so used to eating low carb high protein and veggies. 

I use albacore tuna in oil it doesn't have the fishy taste and I only use a 1/2 teaspoon mayo. 

I make stuff with bread I just tend to pick it off.
1658 2018-09-13 20:30:36 Oil thigh baby

1667 2018-09-13 20:29:34 2008 - GLOBAL RECESSION caused by US financial system meltdown.  10 year anniversary.   Harper was masterful in managing economy.  2014 - Oil prices collapse from $115 per barrel to $35.  Trudeau has benefited from rebound in oil prices.
1668 2018-09-13 20:29:05 “Guns and butter” 12x16 oil on board. #renati thanks for looking.  @ Black Anchor Collective
1669 2018-09-13 20:29:04 And where’s oil??
1670 2018-09-13 20:28:59 Home made bread is the best.  Maybe dipped in a really good quality lime flavored olive oil.
1671 2018-09-13 20:28:58 County NatWest, I have no claim to fame, buy calls in oil a few but mostly I do bear calls as that is more fun moron pizza boy no idea? I bought a loss making place turned it around & sold at a profit but never employed morons - meet enough who tweeted shite to me

1673 2018-09-13 20:28:55 Yep, 1st time is terrifying. “After that, you can get up there & sell snake oil.”  Nuckie Johnson/Steve Buscemi, Boardwalk Empire. Basically true. Repetition usually works.
1674 2018-09-13 20:28:50 I wish I could put it better.  It tastes like makeup factory runoff with a dirt aftertaste.  And everytime I burp, I smell olive oil...
1675 2018-09-13 20:28:45 this jamaican black castor oil better do it’s job....
1676 2018-09-13 20:28:36 after condom sex it smell like u done gave the bitch a oil change
1677 2018-09-13 20:28:31 Letto. Alla fine Haftar più sostegni ha meglio è per lui. E appunto Italia aveva canale egiziano e anche russo da sfruttare. Non capisco perchè concluda che canali migranti e soprattutto oil arrivano però da Tripoli. Io ricordavo che il grosso dei pozzi fosse in Cirenaica.

Palm oil free and vegan
1679 2018-09-13 20:28:20 More BS. Energy East was to export tarsands oil overseas, not to supply eastern Canada and reduce imported oil. Quit lying.
1680 2018-09-13 20:28:15 Bad turbo or leaking valve guides, we've come to the conclusion of. But ik pretty sure it's the turbo, my intercooler piping has a little more oil in there, than normal.
1681 2018-09-13 20:28:06 Miffed that Obasanjo has not responded to the sex for oil block allegation levelled against him by Professor Wole Soyinka.
1682 2018-09-13 20:27:57 NO!!!!Obama dug the US out of a deep hole that deregulation over the past 8 years caused. Big Banks, Big Oil, Big Pharmaceutical, Big Insurance, and on and on. Get a gripe James.
1683 2018-09-13 20:27:38 Red oil no dey...
1684 2018-09-13 20:27:35 BS,you are an oil company surrogate,who falsely put the word energy in your name.We want Clean Energy,Not finite fuels,fracked and drilled from our fragile earth.

1688 2018-09-13 20:26:43 No if they cared for terrorism they wouldn't have taken such a shit response that just bred more terrorism. That said I've heard oil is a powerful aphrodisiac for people that can only get hard over power and greed.

1701 2018-09-13 20:25:30 My sources tell me that Woodward blew all his money on hairless Filipino boys and is now trying to peddle his latest rag in order to purchase Hillary Clinton bobblehead dolls which he inserts anally while masturbating to an oil painting of Fidel Castro in a tutu...

1704 2018-09-13 20:24:57 Cig smell stains your clothing weed on the other hand goes away after a period of time. I agree with you if you want to smoke do it in your house like it is suppose to be done. if you want to smoke outside get a vape pen with Oil.
1705 2018-09-13 20:24:37 That’s great!! I’ve been using castor oil recently it’s been really clearing my dry scalp up too
1706 2018-09-13 20:24:26 Protests in #Basra are still ongoing on Water crisis and electricity issues. Today one of the protesters in Basra been killed by the security forces. 

Only in #Iraq, people are protesting for clean water, while under their feet there is trillions of Oil barrels. #Iraq
1707 2018-09-13 20:24:23 I worked somewhere where our environmentally themed kids day was sponsored by an oil company. But without their money we couldn’t hold the event.
1708 2018-09-13 20:24:15 Yeah exactly what I calculated in my head and I was also wondering how much you bought tomatoes and onions plus oil and maggi
1709 2018-09-13 20:24:15 Theres got to be a Paper or TV/Radio news station that knows UK onshore Oil is good for Britain. That hasn't been infested with green liberals. What the hell happened to The Telegraph & Times? They must know UK onshore energy supplies are safer than foriegn Oil & Gas

Fool News.
1710 2018-09-13 20:23:53 Thank you! I started using this Palmer's Olive oil spray a few weeks ago and I brushed it out of the shower for the first time yesterday and it felt amazing
1711 2018-09-13 20:23:49 It can be conceited as you can conceive but we're NORTH and can never condescend on our highly placed and naturally favored position.

1716 2018-09-13 20:23:16 The fracking tech came out of Prudential Steel, a Calgary company with owners like Stampede Oil and Gas. The started making induction welded seam pipe in the 60s and later wrote spec. for gas pipe that exceeded all other standard at the time. Cheny coppied our tech.
1717 2018-09-13 20:23:08 Most people making predictions were already picking SJ to finish ahead of the Oil. But somehow them getting better sewers the Oilers season? If we are fighting for a wildcard spot with SJ down the stretch (seems unlikely) & they knock the Oil out then they have a point I suppose.
1718 2018-09-13 20:23:05 It’s really not... Oil have the money to sign him, they just don’t want to overpay... I know those facts don’t fit your complaining though
1719 2018-09-13 20:22:49 I think I will make prints of my BTS oil paintings available on Etsy... 
Has anyone sold things off Etsy before? Has it worked well for them? This isn't for a real business move, more just a side thing...
1720 2018-09-13 20:22:40 @realDonaldTrump so tell me how these sanctions and traffics are helping Americans! Maine heating oil up 59cents a gallon..where are these folks getting an extra $240 a month to pay for at least 400 gallons a month? Screwed them again!

1725 2018-09-13 20:22:00 I bet you didn't taste Algerian olive oil 
1726 2018-09-13 20:21:45 I took a fish oil pill and it frekin popped in my mouth and the smell & tastee was so disgustingly fishy. I forever lost my appetite for fish 

Yes, including sushi
1727 2018-09-13 20:21:32 I'm a huge fan of Gochujang! I get the Korean kind and make my own Kimchi sometimes. A great sauce for wings is Gochujang, some Ketchup, tiny bit of Soy Sauce, Sugar, Garlic, Ginger, a dash of Fish Sauce + Sesame Oil, then mix it up real good.

1731 2018-09-13 20:21:13 Turns out she doesn't have a Ph.D in psychology.  She has one in "human and organizational systems."  She bought it online from "Fielding Graduate University."   Snake oil.  Doctorate for $9500 hahah
1732 2018-09-13 20:20:58 I don’t believe they are wrong but a very frustrating short. No real catalyst to point to outside of oil spiking >100
1733 2018-09-13 20:20:53 No, I was more interested in the oil or whatever it was a couple of cm's under the top of the sand. And I found a lot of seafishing tackle so that made up for it.

1737 2018-09-13 20:20:37 I assume you didn't get sprayed with oil?
1738 2018-09-13 20:20:29 Chairs in mega-lunch are more valuable than oil at this point.
1739 2018-09-13 20:20:15 Carpetbaggers, snake oil salesmen, charlatans. That’s what the idiot brings to the table.
1740 2018-09-13 20:19:56 This is disingenuous. Send this letter to Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar etc. Where much the oil we use comes from.  Secondly, ask all medical industries to do without plastics, and stop the manufacture of all medical equipment (including metal stuff). Get serious.
1741 2018-09-13 20:19:55 more than an oil company office... it seems a bar.... or a Foxtons office....
1742 2018-09-13 20:19:52 IMO, this is the only reasonable reason to process oil into products at max levels with higher than seasonal stocks - bet on upside.
Just in case: I uderstand that I don't take #crude_quality_matters into account. 2/2

1745 2018-09-13 20:19:35 things happening right know in brazil: our government is discussing about making LEGAL to KILL WHALES to sell their skin, fat and oil and we can't do shit about it :(

1748 2018-09-13 20:19:31 watching non-artists deal with the aftermath of oil paint because they did literally no research on it before hand is so incredibly frustrating lol
1749 2018-09-13 20:19:20 I was just thinking of a brown sugar and coconut oil scrub! 

Kylo “at least that’s edible”
1750 2018-09-13 20:19:17 also i’m out of maracuja oil so basically my life is over
1751 2018-09-13 20:19:11 Yeah those types of reactions are pretty priceless to read. Not sure what they expected or why one trade by one team in our conference that most had picked to finish ahead of the Oil already suddenly means the sky is falling for the Edmonton Oilers season.

Does that seem about right?
1755 2018-09-13 20:18:56 Yep, drizzle - in relation to both rain and cuisine (a drizzle of olive oil)

1763 2018-09-13 20:18:13 @ElizHardball writes in Alaska, oil companies seeing consequences of climate change. Shorter winters are “impacting use of ice roads for oil exploration” and construction... it’s also forcing “more refrigeration technology to stabilize thawing permafrost beneath infrastructure.”
1764 2018-09-13 20:18:06 Lol
That's the norm here
1765 2018-09-13 20:17:59 Im good at what I do. This is just one of the many things I can do with oil! Lol
1766 2018-09-13 20:17:52 Cut government HANDOUTS to big Oil to help pay for it.
1767 2018-09-13 20:17:52 Couldn't really make it up... The Matrix is definitely due its 2million year service, think the oil might need changed.

1775 2018-09-13 20:17:32 Oil industry innovations have led to our resurgence in our increased petroleum production, not the President!  The economy has not been deregulated!
1776 2018-09-13 20:17:27 Ok I'm not in the Young Living cult or anything, but you guys should really do some research into essential oils. Lavender, peppermint, tea tree oil, etc. have so many health benefits.

If u go down that route, make sure to moisture cause tea tree can dry your skin out!! I feel ur pain though on the spot front. If u ask for advice they can give u recommendations!

And like I would always say "if you know, you know"
1787 2018-09-13 20:16:28 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?

1789 2018-09-13 20:16:27 @batemancentre I can only assume by your signature on a letter calling to end of Trans Mountain that all of you paintings are with water colour, correct? Also there was no modern tech using oil based products involved either!
1790 2018-09-13 20:16:22 I thought the @_BCCOS is also heavily involved with this. If this is true, why are they not mentioned? 
I also noticed how Ronald Wilson was careful not to mention the oil and gas industry that is most often blamed for the Caribou decline in NEBC. 1/2

1794 2018-09-13 20:15:50 I see people who say they like Spaghetti and I'm like yeah? What else do you like? Armed Robbery? Illegal Oil Bunkering? Car snatching?
1795 2018-09-13 20:15:49 You know God is on your side when you only have $58 and you have to get your oil changed and it comes out to $57.58 #blessed 
1796 2018-09-13 20:15:48 @Jenna_Marbles @juliensolomita oil paint can be removed by gamsol/paint thinner which is the “water” for oil paints since it is hydrophobic so water will literally do nothing. I am a oil painter so I am so proud of you!!!
1797 2018-09-13 20:15:48 If you read the article the surge in oil production wasn’t bc of Obumma, it was in spite of him. The surge came from private lands that he had no control over. Federal lands had drastically reduced production. Again he takes credit where none is due.
1798 2018-09-13 20:15:45 You need that oil to breakthrough that barrier!!!!!

1804 2018-09-13 20:15:12 The house smells of hot blackcurrant medicine drinks, eucalyptus vapor rub and olbas oil. No one will ever guess we have the first cold of the season. Him first, now me.

1806 2018-09-13 20:15:04 Just getting an oil change! Not getting rid of my little Dragon Ball. Probably never. 
1807 2018-09-13 20:15:01 ماشاء الله تبارك الله الرحمن الرحيم تتهنو دايما وابدا يارب العالمين
1808 2018-09-13 20:14:59 When we look from 1950’s oil prices have been constantly increasing . Because of the consumption and the fear of gulf countries in future production of oil. We should better invest on alternate resource of energy .
1809 2018-09-13 20:14:58 Family member of mine taught elementary for years.  Always included a drop of Tea Tree essential oil in her shampoo.  Never a bug.
1810 2018-09-13 20:14:49 Just when I thought I was going to catch up on some sleep tomorrow I get a call to remind me about my oil change in the morning
1811 2018-09-13 20:14:40 Love to try the castor oil shampoo for hair growth and the conditioner for shine.. I need healthy hair.
1812 2018-09-13 20:14:18 Birch water and lavender SMELLS SO AMAZING AND CLEAN! Oil of Olay’s whipped foam body wash is my new fave. 
1813 2018-09-13 20:14:11 Amla oil, castor oil, and black seed oil!! Mix them all up and leave it on for a couple of hours as a hair mask
1814 2018-09-13 20:14:06 Never short oil on a Friday? 
1815 2018-09-13 20:14:01 Pres. Buhari was Governor of Borno State and Bauchi State ( previously Northeastern State) in the 70s. Please list what he did to improve those states when N1.00 was 0.50 cents...yes Naira was stronger than the Dollar and crude oil was booming.
1816 2018-09-13 20:13:59 Regarding oil products my understading is that US refiners are running at max levels because they bet on upside from Iranian sanctions, i.e. better run crude at $70-80/bbl at max level now than run at 90-100/bbl. 1/2
1817 2018-09-13 20:13:40 Live in Wokingham yes, born and grew up here no - Well done Poirot! And as for switching allegiances between oil funded clubs well that’s perhaps a little ironic don’t you think??? I’d work on that grammar as well pal

IK is returning public property to the public and you are apposing. Your thouts are reflecting side affects of olive oil and honey of Sindh.
1820 2018-09-13 20:13:16 Kind of reminds me of an oil rig
1821 2018-09-13 20:13:15 The same cheese and nuts and oil, put I also chucked in a garlic clove and a little bit of honey!

1824 2018-09-13 20:13:04 Why not. Give a better answer than “oil money” or don’t bother.
1825 2018-09-13 20:13:02 Oil is used to make plastic. Credit cards are made of plastic, so you need oil to shop! How about that? #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
1826 2018-09-13 20:13:00 I’m currently getting my oil changed. So there’s that.
1827 2018-09-13 20:12:57 ですよねぇ！
特にこういう注意は子供に向けて「ここはこういう理由で危ないから近づいちゃダメだよ！」って場合が多いと思うので、注意書きとしてとても優秀ですよね(ɔ*´ω`*c)
1828 2018-09-13 20:12:56 Very true. They would have killed for the Oil...

1831 2018-09-13 20:12:47 The guy at the oil change place complimented my makeup skills and my eyebrows then fixed my bumper for free. Never been so flattered
1832 2018-09-13 20:12:47 i put mayonnaise salt, pepper, garlic powder and a little lemon and cut up some fresh garlic to put in it and rub it all over and put a little oil in a pan on the stove and it might turn into a bunch of pieces but it’s good like that anyways
1833 2018-09-13 20:12:38 PSA: eliminate vegetable oils (with the exception of olive oil) from your diet. Most vegetable oils don’t fall into the category of actual food. #formerlyknownasfood
1834 2018-09-13 20:12:31 I’m due for an oil change in only a few more weeks.
1835 2018-09-13 20:12:30 How do you use cbd oil? Do you ingest it?
1836 2018-09-13 20:12:26 If your blocked noses haven't shifted guys try no dairy & drops of albus oil in the bath & on your pillow
Felt I needed to butt in & offer my belated top tips acquired from years of similar experiences 
Be well soon
1837 2018-09-13 20:12:23 Why did you retweet "lol"?
Because you saw a fine face or because the lol was actually funny?
1838 2018-09-13 20:12:16 Omf I've just flicked chilli oil all up my mothers cream kitchen wall ... fuck I'm dead
1839 2018-09-13 20:12:13 Reason I fear for Nigeria. Look at Syria, Libya & now Venezuela even with their oil,  there's still chaos. 

The cartels & militias control these resources & in order to gain maximum control,  they need to continuously keep the masses poor by diverting & hoarding funds(Resources)
1840 2018-09-13 20:12:08 Shalom Sis, yes olive oil is good.
1841 2018-09-13 20:12:01 And competes with big oil.
1842 2018-09-13 20:11:44 Understand! PPP don’t bother whether you’re having HONEY or OLIVE OIL . We understand it has nothing with you, ur leadership is in frustration coz of NAB accountability. Yes, we’re focused on Austerity & Accountability but THAR’s water, draught, health & edu is a real issues.
1843 2018-09-13 20:11:37 Oil painting class with @paulrbrent today! (Swipe to see backwards progression). Very different than watercolors! Happy with my first attempt at oils in over 30 years and most importantly I had fun!
1844 2018-09-13 20:11:13 Which type of soup is that? 
The oil is looking like it's keeping malice with the soup inside the water. 

Mba biko
1845 2018-09-13 20:11:10 Your fuel rewards are a different type of gamification and the customer might think they are playing the game, but in actual fact they are the pawns in a game played by the oil companies and to some degree NZAA. What we need is Smart Cities.
1846 2018-09-13 20:11:04 اجمل واحلا اجواء سبحان الله وكنا رايحين نقاهه انا وام العيال وكانت شي خيال
1847 2018-09-13 20:10:21 Yes. And checked the oil. It started smoking and officially died.
1848 2018-09-13 20:10:20 おにーさんにまかせとけー！
1849 2018-09-13 20:10:13 Of course!

Steam and the oil you're telling me telling me
1851 2018-09-13 20:10:08 this oil body scrub from bath and body works broke my whole body out :(
1852 2018-09-13 20:10:07 It’s crude oil at that... people stay puffin on hot dog water  it’s just as bad over here on the east coast
1853 2018-09-13 20:10:05 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
1854 2018-09-13 20:09:53 North are so tired of Nigeria just like the Biafrans 

If the oil was in the north, we would have long divided
1855 2018-09-13 20:09:38 Class wars, then and us.
1856 2018-09-13 20:09:18 Used creed aventus perfume oil and this one has been sniffing me all day! Kukuma lick me ma
1857 2018-09-13 20:09:16 You know that back in the day, some "genius" figured out the mystic powers of snake oil? They sold it by the barrel, despite all the scientific propaganda saying it wasnt even a thing. 
Then, it turns out, it wasnt a thing. And the enlightened rubes who fell for it looked dumb.
1858 2018-09-13 20:09:00 Is CBD oil legal in Tennessee? Read before you buy!

1861 2018-09-13 20:08:54 Anything from Holland & Barrett is usually great! A bit pricey, but all organic products. I use their charcoal scrub then pure tea tree oil diluted with warm water on my face daily and it changed my life 
1862 2018-09-13 20:08:52 What you gotta do

1866 2018-09-13 20:08:10 The Opposition must Revolt against such Fracking Projects as Water Levels Reduce in the Region.. The Opposition should Throw out the Pvt Oil & Gas Firms Business Owners out of the Country as they are Causing Water Levels to Deplete in the Country by such Fracking Projects.

1871 2018-09-13 20:07:32 Although I personally don't require treatment w/medical marijuana & hemp variants such as CBD Oil, recognize others are benefitting from treatment.

1875 2018-09-13 20:07:10 Lol!
1876 2018-09-13 20:07:07 Pepsi and Nestlé are refusing to drop their palm oil business partner -- even though that very company is destroying the last of the rainforest that orangutans call home.
1877 2018-09-13 20:07:01 My lobes are terrible only if I forget to oil and clean them lol. But my nose is god awful lol.
1878 2018-09-13 20:06:54 I’m all about olive oil references!
1879 2018-09-13 20:06:44 Terrible but not as bad as washing palm oil off white plates

1881 2018-09-13 20:06:06 I am sincerely tired of all of my friends. What did I do here again?
1882 2018-09-13 20:06:00 The Opposition must Revolt against such Fracking Projects as Water Levels Reduce in the Region.. The Opposition should Throw out the Pvt Oil & Gas Firms Business Owners out of the Country as they are Causing Water Levels to Deplete in the Country by such Fracking Projects.

#ToxicAfricanMentality
1884 2018-09-13 20:05:59 We don't use or need much Bitumen. It's what Alberta exports and why we must import Saudi oil and why that won't stop. The hypocrisy is Conservatives living in an alternate reality. Peak Bitumen will hit AB by about 2025 when the bunker fuel ban comes into effect on the seas.
1885 2018-09-13 20:05:53 The core of the bunch is the largest oil sales company in Japan.
They tried to hijack the oil import / export route, gas / gasoline sales network.
All of the URLs are connected in a chain form, but Web sites that are not hijacked are also included.
1886 2018-09-13 20:05:49 I’m slathering my hair in coconut oil and calling it a day
1887 2018-09-13 20:05:42 Maybe cooked in an orange oil?
1888 2018-09-13 20:05:41 ليش رحتوها

1890 2018-09-13 20:05:05 Just think how many would have been killed if there was no oil and Syria didn't have the best wine in the region.
1891 2018-09-13 20:05:04 Question of the day: how do you extract natural oils out of plants, for example basil oil and mint oil
1892 2018-09-13 20:04:41 Ode
1893 2018-09-13 20:04:35 CBD oil and tea help me.
1894 2018-09-13 20:04:31 He was just checking the oil!
1895 2018-09-13 20:04:30 Oil causes cholesterol shouldn't we stop planting oilseeds.
And then butter and milk also cause cholesterol so what will be yogijis response on butter n milk
1896 2018-09-13 20:04:26 Haha.... Bilkul Mil sakta hai... Honey and olive oil have now a very special place in our politics 
1897 2018-09-13 20:04:14 @nailogical SOS pls send me an oil pen
1898 2018-09-13 20:04:08 What of the VAT on oil is reduced to 12 percent...Will it still bite?
1899 2018-09-13 20:03:57 I think they are now so deep in Soros' pockets that they are plotting to over-throw the duly elected President and take over the country as socialist!!  It is high treason in my opinion!
1900 2018-09-13 20:03:49 @ZoeSugg what is the oil you use for the ends of your hair?? I need some!
1901 2018-09-13 20:03:48 I would rather credit the booming economy and oil and gas industry in PA. The one you and other leftists are diligently trying to kill here in PA. You know I am right. #Leftistsmustbestopped
1902 2018-09-13 20:03:45 RT younglivingeo katenotaro This is one of our favorite essential oil blends that we personally use each day, as well! 
1903 2018-09-13 20:03:40 Now that I can't help you with, about a tablespoon of oil in the bottom of a saucepan & enough corn to cover the bottom completely without being too deep. I don't weigh the fecking stuff!
1904 2018-09-13 20:03:18 spread the concessional loans repayment debts.the good thing with Vatfuel levy is the ever changing international price of oil
1905 2018-09-13 20:03:17 I understand the construction thing, truly :) Those aren't the regulations to which I refer. I'm thinking about consumer, worker and environmental protections, protection of students in schools, chemicals/oil/gas.
1906 2018-09-13 20:03:15 Imo state has palm oil and cassava. I don't think we should look at exporting agricultural raw materials. And look at improving the value chain so that we can sell finished products for a higher value!
1907 2018-09-13 20:03:03 The UK does not manage oil reserves. The grant licenses to private companies to drill, extract and explore  then tax then on profits.
1908 2018-09-13 20:02:59 As for me  south boys are not sleeping @all.  Bag of investment since our oil money is no more let's use tourism and light our dark houses up.

1909 2018-09-13 20:02:56 There is a constant reference to SW Airlines with High EQ and a Daniel that has been made with oil and gas to New Orleans for about 10 years now. It ties to a business law class on one of my college campuses.
1910 2018-09-13 20:02:53 If your gonna drill oil you have to do it manually. Good luck finding people to do that
1911 2018-09-13 20:02:50 I tried CBD oil but only helped a bit with pain. I might get into some podcasts again.
1912 2018-09-13 20:02:47 For too long the threat of high gas prices has dictated America's policies toward the Middle East. We have oil. We have refineries. We have the ability to produce our own fuels. We've been too dependent on foreign goods for far too long. It's time for America to come 1st.
1913 2018-09-13 20:02:32 Not just govt financial assets. Stock markets, real estate, exchange rates, food, oil.
1914 2018-09-13 20:02:31 Well, well, well...
After 2 weeks of anxiously waiting, @UKenyatta finally acts by rejecting the #FinanceBill2018

On 14th Sept. The ERC will increase the prices once again during the monthly review. This follows increase of crude oil prices globally.
#UhuruRejectsFinanceBill2018
1915 2018-09-13 20:02:26 Exactly. For diversification they wanted the IPO of Saudi Aramco but the low oil prices mean they can’t sell the shares at a price they want. 

For now their Anti Iran approch earns them huge deals with US, around $50 b trade. I think the reasons are more economic than religious.
1916 2018-09-13 20:02:20 If we producing more oil, why do gas prices keep going up??  #LowerTheGasPrice
1917 2018-09-13 20:02:05 Oil drip pan makes great magnet board. #ARSL2018
1918 2018-09-13 20:01:51 Are they willing to go to mid east to protest? Where East Canada import oil from? If no, STFU.
1919 2018-09-13 20:01:34 Y'all clearly know nothing about global Oil prices which are the main contributor to the rise in gas prices.. Governments stupidity which leads to a weaker rand as well as trumps inability to do he's job without causing kak is a factors.
1920 2018-09-13 20:01:30 Oil field stuff.  Water transfer to be precise.
1921 2018-09-13 20:01:25 The madness starts on Monday officially then will carry on, stylishly of course, until the second week of October. So, essentially 31 days of chaos, coffee, glitter, baby oil, heels, flights, and no sleep [chuckles]
1922 2018-09-13 20:01:24 I'm hoping the Trump Administration plan to choke Tehran economically will bring down the Iranian regime. They're trying to cut off their ability to export oil, which is their prime source of revenue and foreign exchange.
1923 2018-09-13 20:01:23 Agreed. Enough.
1924 2018-09-13 20:01:01 Because if there’s one person I trust to talk about sexism, it’s an incel who peddles snake oil and lives in his mom’s basement.
1925 2018-09-13 20:00:50 This is one of our favorite essential oil blends that we personally use each day, as well! 
1926 2018-09-13 20:00:49 High school???   Really???

Just hold the vote already.
1927 2018-09-13 20:00:45 Ignition Coil killer , Oil leaks from valve covers seals are the most common concern on destroying a ignition coil. Spark plug tube seals fail , Filling up with oil and causing coil to fail. Repairing oil leaks will save you $$$ on later repairs .
1928 2018-09-13 20:00:35 I hate to break this to you Greg but the way things are going every drop of oil on this planet and likely every chunk of coal is going to be burnt before we transfer to some new technology yet to be an equivalent.  That should be about 300 years from now.

1931 2018-09-13 20:00:22 I need some coconut oil..
1932 2018-09-13 20:00:16 I don't know about you patriots but this shit is as aggressive as Nazi Germany we can't wait much longer to start our campaign against tyranny from the Democratic party we must stomp until the ground shakes
1933 2018-09-13 20:00:11 the usa hasn't been a democracy since JFK was killed. 
I am sorry ma'am. the military industrial & oil complex is real.
1934 2018-09-13 20:00:02 Body oil? My friend you’re the only one
1935 2018-09-13 19:59:58 Ok i will concede the oil. but it should be on the black market keep the vat out of Westminster.
I propose south armagh in charge of vat evasion
1936 2018-09-13 19:59:53 Who will be in charge? A oil tycoon who only wants to destroy everything and screw everyone to make money? Will it be like the rest of them in Trump’s cabinet? How much golf will they play?
1937 2018-09-13 19:59:17 What? We need to open OTHER markets to Canadian oil.
1938 2018-09-13 19:59:12 Hey dipstick, the economy is the best it has ever been, millions of new jobs created, and we are now the largest oil producer in the world. Trump can and does accept responsibility for that.  He did not, however, drop the ball on Puerto Rico. An inept Democrat did that.
1939 2018-09-13 19:59:07 Feinstein: “Now we need to delay the vote until we investigate this claim, and the other one that I’m about to release that is being invented as I speak”.........

Come on, Y’all know a 2nd one is coming.
1940 2018-09-13 19:59:05 There's a company that makes cups and straws out of corn husks.

There's a company that makes forks/knives/plastic-looking packaging/spoons/clamshell to-go boxes out of potatoes.

Oil is no longer an acceptable answer.

Reduce reuse recycle.
1941 2018-09-13 19:58:49 200 bucks for an oil change and headlight repair. Don't buy a Malibu.

1943 2018-09-13 19:58:47 You mean like the oil spill Obama played cronyism politics over, rather than clean up quickly?

1946 2018-09-13 19:58:43 Lies! titus is 300naira minimum + 80 naira egg ... Pepper ,oil maggi and salt ... Still 300?
1947 2018-09-13 19:58:33 Isn't phosphate so important to us so we can super charge grass growth so we can grow more sheep cows deer, to export more animal flesh and milk products to pay for our over importation of oil & vehicles etc to try & sustain an unsustainable way of life that is destroying planet
1948 2018-09-13 19:58:29 Wow... @Nissan - put the wrong numbers on my paperwork about tyre measurements, emptied a tank of screenwash & puts water in to replace it & put on my paperwork that they’ve put 250ml of screenwash in and now I’ve got a leak because they’ve not put the oil drain plug on properly

1954 2018-09-13 19:57:58 democrats think they can make oil companies change their ways. (they cant)
republicans worship oil companies. (it's gross)
it would appear we are screwed.
1955 2018-09-13 19:57:52 Jim: What were you gals spraying at the shop?
Me: Why?
Jim: It smells So Good!!
Me: We were diffusing a Brand New Oil Blend.  You like?
Jim: Yes
Me: Thank you
1956 2018-09-13 19:57:51 Vitamin E oil with it.
Last step!: I then take a q-tip and dip the part with the cotton into Apple Cider Vinegar. I then put it on my stubborn pimples. This helps with getting rid of them.

But for this to really work, tour going to have to drink 8 - 10 cups of water a day. I kno
1957 2018-09-13 19:57:39 I think you know me better than that! Other favorite car extras:

1958 2018-09-13 19:57:36 If it isn't, she'll be smeared worse than a BP oil spill
1959 2018-09-13 19:57:33 That is nonsense,  Utterly so. 

Alberta does not pay enough in taxes. So the oil crash enhanced a structural deficit from the PCAA era, when they would run $4B deficits with $110/BL oil. However, capital spending throughout has been about $6B a year.

I still maintain that we are still United because of Oil

1962 2018-09-13 19:57:23 there are currently 3 different tweets in my drafts challenging @benshapiro to a oil wrestling match
1963 2018-09-13 19:57:15 Audiobooks and CBD oil for me.
1964 2018-09-13 19:57:03 Yes. Scott Kirby just said oil and gas is 1 percent of @united's revenues. So not much of a hedge.

1968 2018-09-13 19:56:27 Would Nigeria had remained one, as a country if this Oil was found in the North?
Well, PMB is teaching the Niger Delta and the entire South how to be a Nationalist. Charity begins in Daura jare
1969 2018-09-13 19:56:14 Someone told them we had oil..
1970 2018-09-13 19:56:12 Don the Con...sell that snake oil Mr. Trump.
1971 2018-09-13 19:56:05 I check my oil & put oil in my car myself....  what nigga I need?
1972 2018-09-13 19:56:04 Delighted to be associated with evil by an Etonian Archbishop of Canterbury speaking at the TUC Congress. The oil industry in West Africa may be a little closer to evil than creating jobs in central Liverpool.
1973 2018-09-13 19:55:50 What are you talking about there are literally dozens of technologies to clean up a heavy oil spill in the open ocean. Your mistake is a belief the dilbit is some unique compound. Chemically it is a heavy oil. It behaves like a heavy oil in every significant sense.
1974 2018-09-13 19:55:49 Lmao not only did he NOT lead them away he drew them to more buildings to smash. Also blew up an oil tanker on a bridge. WILD 
1975 2018-09-13 19:55:46 Start throwing holy water/holy oil...and I'm Baptist. #ijs
1976 2018-09-13 19:55:45 Well, demonstrably yes. As oil revenue is virtually zero and there has been no movement in the internationally recognised credit ratings of the UK. These are indicators of its ability to repay debt.
1977 2018-09-13 19:55:42 Yes, changing times but it’s more about diversifying their economy given the decreasing oil prices globally and shift towards renewable energy sources, they had no choice but to open up. MBS is definitely changing KSA.  From what I have read, yes, there are positive changes vis
1978 2018-09-13 19:55:36 Argan Oil Combo to help with my wild curls and keep they moisturized!   @markgirljana
1979 2018-09-13 19:55:13 What is one remedy you use often? We use lavender with a small touch of peppermint oil to sometimes soothe our horses if they become anxious.
1980 2018-09-13 19:55:09 To Jollibee Food
Ang sarap sarap ng food ninyo.
Ngayon,bawal muna ako kumain na merong oil.
Miss ko yung mga food,  especially Chicken Joy, Spaghetti, Lumpia and Garlic Pepper Beef
Bawal din ako sa softdrinks.
See you soon, Jollibee.
God Bless Everyone
( Miss You)
1981 2018-09-13 19:55:09 My favourite is Lavender oil because it makes my mind calm amd soothes my soul! The best part is whenever I smell this oil at night, I get amazing and sound sleep  #PositiveThinkingDay
1982 2018-09-13 19:55:06 Complimentary olive oil shots to wash down the joy of taking home a miniature.
1983 2018-09-13 19:54:55 Why not use avocado oil? Super healthy and high smoke point. Works great.
1984 2018-09-13 19:54:54 And they gave Obama a pass for that massive oil spill in the Gulf,  as well as the shitty clean up of the spill.
1985 2018-09-13 19:54:46 Well, you're all set the next time random hot women stop by for an olive oil orgy.....as long as long as you have a tarp.
1986 2018-09-13 19:54:41 This is not possible when you can’t fill your stadium each week and have a small fan base around the world!!Something fishy going on! Smells like Corrupt Arab oil money to me!
1987 2018-09-13 19:54:35 So when was the last crucifixion of a dissident in Saudi When was the last democratic vote Who decided who controls the oil wealth Why was Saudi Arabia so involved in 9 11?
1988 2018-09-13 19:54:23 I just hit my pen and thought it was still messed up and not burning the oil but that bitch hit and hit me hard. I just coughed my brains out omg
1989 2018-09-13 19:54:23 Agreed, and these two attacks were highlighted as it was in Tripoli. This is just the peak of the iceberg.
Several attacks, checkpoints and more were done near Oil / Gas Infrastructures.
1990 2018-09-13 19:54:16 Won't that create a surplus/ glut of snake oil?
1991 2018-09-13 19:53:54 i’m sitting here at treadquarters getting an oil change and i feel like the coolest monkey in the jungle
1992 2018-09-13 19:53:53 I be looking oily af at work with all this coconut oil on my face 
1993 2018-09-13 19:53:52 @Walmart better hook you up with a lifetime of free oil, or something 
1994 2018-09-13 19:53:52 Tbf he's oil level rich. He could drop a billion and he wouldn't even notice.
1995 2018-09-13 19:53:44 After carrying home 20 liters and $200 of oil to avoid having to ask my own company for a refund, this does seem to be the logical conclusion.
1996 2018-09-13 19:53:43 Since when was it a good idea for oil tycoons like the Rockefellers to run the medical industry?
1997 2018-09-13 19:53:41 Abi u want to lie? You've forgotten that some of us knew you from when you were a baby
1998 2018-09-13 19:53:27 Let's play a game and see who can recall the most Kermit mishaps!

Kermit stepped in oil paint
Kermit got stung by a bee
Kermit fell in the pool
Kermit broke his tail
Kermit dislocated his knee
Kermit ate a bunch of chocolate

So I got 6

2001 2018-09-13 19:53:15 "Why not go to war just for oil? We need oil. What do Hollywood celebrities imagine fuels their private jets? How do they think their cocaine is delivered to them?"
2002 2018-09-13 19:53:07 looked up the political donations of a childhood friend- now a wealthy oil/fracking/commodities trading bro

His donations to R congressman David Valadeo all list his occupation as "farmer"

my dude, the only farming you ever did was farts in your sleeping bag at summer camp.
2003 2018-09-13 19:53:01 Olive oil
2004 2018-09-13 19:52:55 I peep coconut oil prices been rising like a mf what’s going on
2005 2018-09-13 19:52:54 The round table on sustainable palm oil certainly has a long way to go!
2006 2018-09-13 19:52:46 'Whoever loves pleasure will be a poor man;
    he who loves wine and oil will not be rich.' Proverbs 21:17
2007 2018-09-13 19:52:33 Any water bottle with couple teaspoon of cooking or olive oil will suffocate them. Yes, I torture those tittle suckers.
2008 2018-09-13 19:52:29 Buddy,,,, you might as well be drinking a quart of oil with some of the beer you drink. I’m willing to die on this hill
2009 2018-09-13 19:52:26 And killing off Seth Rich wasn’t? Starting a war in Syria for an oil pipeline.. the IC fbi dnc doj msm manufacturing evidence and all wh get in the way steamrolled to reverse an election ... all anti American and evil
2010 2018-09-13 19:52:09 Eggs is #100

Assuming you have Oil, Maggi, Salt at home: that's total #800.
2011 2018-09-13 19:52:07 THIS A MOVIE ABOUT SOME BUSINESS DUDE GOING TO A REMOTE SCOTLAND VILLAGE TO BUY IT FOR OIL SHIT BUT HE AND THIS OTHER SCOTTISH GUY GET TO KNOW THE VILLAGE AND ITS PEOPLE AND LICKS THIS GIRL'S FEET ON A DATE BYE

2013 2018-09-13 19:52:04 Such a good feeling when you get to the point on holiday when the oil can come out
2014 2018-09-13 19:51:54 Also how much revenue do we get from oil at the moment.
2015 2018-09-13 19:51:46 Natural habitat: laying in the pool, oily af from tanning oil, watermelon juice dripping down my face
2016 2018-09-13 19:51:38 I have one, 135,000 miles right now and never had one single issue beyond normal car maintenance (oil changes & tires)
2017 2018-09-13 19:51:30 All of them are developing oil industry tech. The oil and gas industry would have ended by now if they had not received from governments who are trying to sacrifice the future for there own profit.
2018 2018-09-13 19:51:30 So true. Shame is used so often to peddle snake oil. So many examples in health care, nutrition, diet, finance, children, etc. 
2019 2018-09-13 19:51:24 Phrases I've used in my lab report so far: 
"Touching the nosepiece, not yanking at the objectives as if they were udders of tiny metal cows" 
"The objective clicked into place, its gaze plunged into the immersion oil so specimen and lens were united in unrefracted bliss"
2020 2018-09-13 19:51:11 We’re looking back in high school now. Pathetic.
2021 2018-09-13 19:51:09 For parasites a teaspoon of 100% pure gum spirits turpentine in a tablespoon of sugar. 1st thing on the morning for 3 days. 

If you have issues with constipation add a little bit of castor oil to it. It’s a natural laxative and a parasite killer.  If severe do a salt water flush
2022 2018-09-13 19:51:01 I would turn this bucket into green coconut oil for my mom! 
We fined tuned an edible oil recipe, and it makes her Parkinson's symptoms easier to manage.
That a bucket of weed I would love to get my hands on!!
2023 2018-09-13 19:51:00 Trini oil down always look like struggle
2024 2018-09-13 19:50:59 Finally hearing frm #RickPerry .@Energy. At #Helsinki, #Putin praised #Trump for working togethr to boost oil prices. Since then, #TrumpUnfit has done everything to hurt #Renewables industry & force demand for #fossilfuel–further screwing Americans #ClimateActionNow #ImpeachTrump

2028 2018-09-13 19:50:42 It would have been better if you sent them abroad for proper training at a facility that has certified oil and gas courses and technical training.
2029 2018-09-13 19:50:39 My slow ass sweating all on my legs and I'm like why am I sweating so bad?. Forgot I put lotion and baby oil on after I got out the shower . !  Should've stayed my ass in the house . !

2033 2018-09-13 19:50:13 we have to have messy things like coal & oil & gas. We can use our own or be at the beck and call of OPEC & co. I care about the environment too. I want my grandkids to be able to see farther than a couple of miles when rhey're in the Smokies. I'm encouraged that progress
2034 2018-09-13 19:50:08 Try a hair oil!!! Put it in after your leave in conditioner and before styling products. It'll make your hair so shiny and moisturized looking
2035 2018-09-13 19:50:02 Currently LPs can only possess dried cannabis, oil, fresh, or a natural intermediary (resin to make oil). Under CA processors be able to produce any kind of ‘cannabis’ ie white powder isolate but like before can only sell cannabis ‘products’ (the aforementioned list)
2036 2018-09-13 19:50:01 You never realize how out of shape you are until you’re coming up with choreography and two minutes later you’re searching for your peppermint essential oil for your sudden migraine and chugging three bottles of water in a row.
2037 2018-09-13 19:49:35 Try getting your mum on 10,000mg turmeric capsules, it fights against cancerous cells, it also makes chemo treatment go better, and try her on CBD oil, this attacks cancerous cells and growths.
2038 2018-09-13 19:49:31 Now you know that ... after you call yourself a prof .... let me even ask you prof apart from oil .... what other export is Nigerian earning forex.then you preach that the economy is better now b4 you came into power ...it is a pity
2039 2018-09-13 19:49:25 I have been correctly chastised by Tweeters for comparing "used car salesmen" to Donald Trump. I humbly apologize for insulting and disrespecting you and giving Trump more credit than I meant to. I should have used the term "snake oil salesmen" or "con artist."
2040 2018-09-13 19:49:19 I'm not an expert in concentrates, by any means, but I think the idea is to isolate the CBD from a particular crop using traditional extraction processes, and then bring it together. No carrier oil is needed, meaning it'd be illegal.
2041 2018-09-13 19:49:18 Do you notice how the posh wind that like to get on the Tele do all sweet pr and let the skint wins sleep rough and get arrested. It's called them loading the bullets and silky Bollox pulls the trigger. Shameful.

2050 2018-09-13 19:48:13 Dear MPs, you betrayed us on the sugar report,we accepted and moved on. Will you still betray us on the 16% VAT on oil?? This is another chance to redeem yourself.@MarthaKarua @EstherPassaris @SakajaJohnson @SpeakerJBMuturi

2052 2018-09-13 19:48:01 (2/2)  Went to the vet and through a series of tests and questions, found that Rosemary is her main trigger. It is in almost all pet food / treats. I have to actually read the label to make sure it isn't in stuff. Also, Tea Tree Oil can cause it, as well.
2053 2018-09-13 19:47:22 Woahhhh what really?? Omg that’s not actually the first time I’ve heard something bad about them  they hook me up tho give me deals and shit one time did my oil free because I was buggin out cause I found out I had a transmission leak

2056 2018-09-13 19:47:16 I was cooking steak and oil splashed onto my hand and it blistered immediately. And then I overcooked my steak. Ice pack on my hand for the rest of the evening 
2057 2018-09-13 19:47:12 Me w/ Tylenol extra strength. Had migraines my whole life, I’d pop 5 of those & be good. Now I’ve been using CBD oil for 2 weeks and haven’t had a migraine since!!! 
2058 2018-09-13 19:47:11 Yes it will make it harder for EU citizens to visit us, so less students and tourists and traders, loss of economic growth , already seen a reduction in student numbers at work from 120 to 45, each paying 9k for course per year and 9k for accomodation, not to mention shopping

2066 2018-09-13 19:46:46 I put coconut oil in my hair & that shit is just melting right down my face also little drops keep dripping off 
2067 2018-09-13 19:46:44 That's right. The Govt has invested sod all in oil and gas production.  Piddling amounts into R&D that's all.  I don't believe they deserve a penny.
2068 2018-09-13 19:46:42 You know me, everyone's favorite lil motor oil scamp!
2069 2018-09-13 19:46:38 I say stuff like this all the time. Send em flint water to drink. Seal those office windows, pump fill co2. Add drops of crude oil to their food.  Only the best for the worst.

2072 2018-09-13 19:46:02 Haha oil could have literally given up next to nothing (like San Jose) to get a Karlsson and probably never even tried. But hey, at least All Connor needs to do it put up 200 points and they will have a shot!

2084 2018-09-13 19:44:43 there's no limit on the concentration of CBD in cannabis oil.  The CBD would need a carrier would it not?

Bi de nane yağı China oil olan
2092 2018-09-13 19:43:46 Again you’re uninformed, that oil is being exported out of Amer it’s not for Amer. Unemployment was dropping steadily, record job creation since you crashed the economy, we didn’t need those 50 jobs to help foreigns sell oil. Tens of thousands lost jobs from the tariffs...
2093 2018-09-13 19:43:45 finally went and got my oil change

Copper Unch at 2.68 lb  $CU
2095 2018-09-13 19:43:36 Seun, we need to invest more in oil. We haven't scratched the surface. No real value derived. From refining to petrochem, which gives birth to thousands of products, which leads to industrialization. In 2yrs on investment in refining, we can have over 100 new mega factories
2096 2018-09-13 19:43:25 CBD Hemp Oil Salvation Balm is a topical that's worked well to treat my pain associated with tendinitis, surgery recovery, and joint problems.  It's on the affordable side of CBD products and its available @dixiebotanicals  
Hope this helps your friend! 
2097 2018-09-13 19:43:19 Not dose of economic intravenous, a heavy dose of honey and olive oil that too free from his handlers. Dollars are really difficult to digest.

2099 2018-09-13 19:43:10 You can't learn to say goodbye. It's not like changing oil or a lightbulb. And the more times you do it, the less you care, not the better you get. Each time is a haiku about the whole of being and an ant, and yet its pattern is the illusion. You learn to die, to live many lives.
2100 2018-09-13 19:43:01 Ya girl took herself off of zoloft over the last month using CBD oil. Fuck with me.
2101 2018-09-13 19:42:58 What BS.....as a start we import all of our crude oil. Without oil the country will not work within a week.
2102 2018-09-13 19:42:55 I love how @DemSocialists literally anywhere else in the country is a valuable resource and helpful organization, and then in Los Angeles it’s basically “ARE YOU TIRED OF PAYING TOO MUCH FOR YOUR ARTISINAL BEARD OIL WHILE LIVING IN SILVERLAKE? JOIN THE RESISTANCE!”

2109 2018-09-13 19:42:02 I don't understand "keep them in a pen to generate crafting ressources  for you!" does that mean they will create iron, oil, leather for  exemple? I don't get it
2110 2018-09-13 19:42:02 Two things have collided to help me think more clearly/sharply than I have in years: excellent sleep and a "bulletproof" style coffee. 

Put grass fed butter and coconut oil in your coffee -- do it!
2111 2018-09-13 19:41:51 why isnt there an emergency hurricane fund? like the strategic oil reserve? just fema/dhs/nat guard approps?

2113 2018-09-13 19:41:40 We do pretty brisk transload business here in Stearns. About fifty cars a week of NS company loads heading to landfill. DCRR still just has the one oil customer in Jasper. That’s enough, given how busy things are in French Lick!
2114 2018-09-13 19:41:39 Drinking oil to own the libs
2115 2018-09-13 19:41:33 You can't fool me. Oil and water don't mix! 
2116 2018-09-13 19:41:16 President Trump,why do We allow oil companys and gas stations to gouge prices on gas during hurricanes why ?
2117 2018-09-13 19:41:10 “I’m not a fan of this oil. I can’t live my life this way.”
2118 2018-09-13 19:41:10 My afro's is 3 yrs old.Wash it daily sometimes twice and I am not complaining.just oil it after washing.
2119 2018-09-13 19:41:08 Triscuits are just the savory version of shredded wheat and they deserve more Snack Respect. I will eat the rosemary & olive oil ones like chips any day.
2120 2018-09-13 19:41:07 That is great but I look forward to lots of tankers and a share price around 10p and rising.

2124 2018-09-13 19:40:56 Before the end, Mach is going to be drinking cups of olive oil to save face. "No really guys, I like it. It tastes good and I'd be cooking with it anyway."
2125 2018-09-13 19:40:37 No problem, take more from Alberta, oops sorry Alberta, 35$ oil leaves you short already.

2129 2018-09-13 19:40:13 Unless climate policy limits oil production, it won't be effective. Whether that is by prohibiting supplies or by pricing demand, the general effects are the same. It depends on the policy tools

2131 2018-09-13 19:40:05 I was doing sociology at University at the time. A lecturer said that the US will allow Arab leaders to do whatever they like providing they do not threaten the oil supply. Sadam broke that rule.
2132 2018-09-13 19:40:02 At one point the whole world will be electrified while here will have oil lamps to illuminate the highways . Oil lamps- electricity from oil
2133 2018-09-13 19:39:56 Bollards can't stop fatbergs. Only people can, which is why they must know the dangers of dumping and flushing grease, oil and baby wipes

2138 2018-09-13 19:39:23 Awe my dad paid for my last oil change, but that’s cause he wanted too
2139 2018-09-13 19:39:13 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

2141 2018-09-13 19:38:53 I would pay to watch ray Lewis stand outside in 100 degree heat and watch that oil spill happen
2142 2018-09-13 19:38:49 I doubt I'll waste that much of it.
My kitchen uses a LOT of oil, and it's not like it goes bad quickly.
Probably.
2143 2018-09-13 19:38:43 I drive it daily i just don't go very far so the oil gets used it doesn't just sit there and gunk up. But if it did yes I'd need to change it but this Jeep is great with the oil I only average 2 oil changes a year since I got it 4 years ago.
2144 2018-09-13 19:38:37 I thought $30 was too much for an oil change but just found out my roommates is $70+ so fuck all of that
2145 2018-09-13 19:38:36 They may as well get the oil prize; they've cornered the rare earth minerals market in Africa with civil engineering projects...
2146 2018-09-13 19:38:24 I’m going to drown it in castor oil
2147 2018-09-13 19:38:16 I am an engine running with no petrol, 
no oil. 
I am an engine running on poisons,  
demons of the modern world.
I work myself into a frenzy,
My aim is to break me,
Before others do the job,
It is my pleasure,
The pain.

2149 2018-09-13 19:38:03 Are they real governors? 

Most governors operating like young adults waiting on daddy (FG) to give them pocket money to pay their rents. 

They rely heavily on crude oil money to pay salaries which is a shame; money meant 4 salaries should be generated by the State and not FG.

2151 2018-09-13 19:37:53 You’re just mad I moved on to oil & gas money.
2152 2018-09-13 19:37:32 That's the funniest thing I have read in a while California has the dirtiest oil in North America bet you his battle isn't with oil producers in California
2153 2018-09-13 19:37:22 I don’t believeyou actually did major in Econ because you would’ve known that era of inflation had nothing to do with the money supply. It was real supply side issues (I believe related to increase of price of oil because of Iranian conflict).
2154 2018-09-13 19:37:21 I just got my oil changed n car cleaned my baby feeling good
2155 2018-09-13 19:37:18 Either your friends don't exist, or they actually are super antisemitic. Either way, cool lie to defend a sentient oil derrick.

2168 2018-09-13 19:35:45 Invest it and use the interest to balance the book. They believe their economy has to break even WITHOUT oil - and it generally does.
2169 2018-09-13 19:35:32 She should change the chip frying oil occasionally... sounds like it’s stale and affecting her mind

No insulin ups and downs to cause those pangs.

2182 2018-09-13 19:34:24 We have gas and oil pipe lines all over this country.  Why can't we construct water lines in the same fashion allowing water to flow through them from places that have plenty of water to those places that need water such as California and Arizona

2185 2018-09-13 19:33:58 I had an opportunity to drink a soda today, and the campaign to tell me that a Diet Dr Pepper tastes like a regular Dr Pepper was the biggest lie in the industry. Diet Dr Pepper tastes like a robot urinated oil and piss in a can
2186 2018-09-13 19:33:50 Does anyone have info about this Jamaican black castor oil? How well does it work?
2187 2018-09-13 19:33:01 Or maybe its because, one side like to preach about easy solutions to very complex problems (Snake oil), while the other is far more pragmatic about what needs to be done.
2188 2018-09-13 19:32:56 u not even supposed to cook high temps wit olive oil it’s avocado or grapeseed

2199 2018-09-13 19:32:00 OK, how about helping PR by completely rebuilding their electricity grid around renewable energy? They have tremendous solar & wind energy resources, & it's expensive to ship oil or gas in. It would save money & be more resilient.

Our fair weathered friends will leave us out in the cold! #PlaceYurBet #WakeUP#37 #Woke Takes 100's of 1,000's of millenniums for the Earth to produce oil, gas. Keep USA oil/gas for US, exclusively! #MAGA #KAG

2208 2018-09-13 19:31:25 How am i just not hearing these Ella Mai jams?? Gotdamn these joints smooth as eggs dipped in olive oil
2209 2018-09-13 19:31:23 Oh it’s soooo easy! In the saucepan before you add water to boil it just add a tiny bit of olive oil and toast in on medium heat for 2-3 minutes and then add the salt/water!
2210 2018-09-13 19:31:08 Oil works well instead of butter in some recipes
2211 2018-09-13 19:31:05 Be sure Secretary Zinke isn't planning, with Trump, to give over their grazing lands to someone who wants to drill oil there. Nothing that is alive, wild & free is valued to Trump. He's willing to kill them all.

2220 2018-09-13 19:30:10 I was quite upset to learn yesterday that apparently oil can go bad. I was counting on this stuff to last quite some time

2222 2018-09-13 19:30:04 Even though Bella's Grove store front will be closed Friday the 14th for Hyde Park Street Fair, we will still be doing the Mystic Oils workshop at 6:30pm! The class is $15 for you to make your own oil.

2232 2018-09-13 19:29:18 But during 2009 to 2014, local market crude oil price rised keeping in trend with international oil market but now it irrational to increase when it is now just $77.00 or so
2233 2018-09-13 19:29:18 Nothing at all to do with oil!
2234 2018-09-13 19:29:09 Oil refineries burning natural gas.
2235 2018-09-13 19:29:06 Hey, that's still more than I was taught (just how to check/refill oil, washer, antifreeze...)
2236 2018-09-13 19:29:03 U cld b describing Shetland there. People come 1st, no shooting estates(Tavish Scott was the only toff I knew when I lived there), a share in oil wealth, ok they don't do huts but they pay UK tax and have Scandi cradle2grave services. They also possess that Nordic egalitarianism.

2239 2018-09-13 19:28:55 Dunno why I thought sunbathing all day wearing only carrot oil would end well
2240 2018-09-13 19:28:37 Would be nice if we did... But I suspect it's the same reason why we keep using a finite energy source (oil/gas/coal) to power a planet that could be powered by an infinite source (sun).
2241 2018-09-13 19:28:11 I never knew oil changes could be so cheap  I’m used to $80 oil changes
2242 2018-09-13 19:28:09 You would say that as an olive oil lover.
2243 2018-09-13 19:27:56 For Saskatchewan industry like agriculture, mining and oil extraction it would be impossible to cut taxes on those industries  enough to offset a carbon tax.

2246 2018-09-13 19:27:32 Pfft. It's all about Syria and oil. These countries are either happy to take a slice or being politic and supporting an ally.

No cancelar significa que, Salinas y su Sierra Oil, se convierta pronto en el más rico del México.
2249 2018-09-13 19:27:25 We wouldn’t need tide water as we would keep all of our oil revenues and not ship the transfers to Ottawa and Quebec. Simple

2277 2018-09-13 19:25:12 Just a lil bit more oil .....that’s all
2278 2018-09-13 19:25:07 Well actually, it depends what you are cooking. Certainly frying with olive oil is no good. But nothing wrong with roasting or even a quick sauté.
2279 2018-09-13 19:24:46 As I'm with creating energy with solar panels&a good thing to use rather than oil or coal etc yet I have awaiting creations 2prevent world from flooding,creations to stop wildfires,creations to clean air of all emissions unto ozone,which we must work quick to restore ozone asWell

2284 2018-09-13 19:24:01 I blocked him. There's already too much snake oil in the world.
2285 2018-09-13 19:24:01 Can I have some of that grape fanta with corn oil and shit in it please? Stuff with all the health warnings on
2286 2018-09-13 19:23:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
2287 2018-09-13 19:23:56 Buscopan is good too I like that and yes peppermint tea is excellent. Ask dr for peppermint capsules there rammed with pure peppermint oil taste fine but then release in the digestive tract and help big big time too

2291 2018-09-13 19:23:46 Shit, might as well cut up some green onions and throw a little bit of olive oil in that bih
2292 2018-09-13 19:23:14 The oil lamp work i didn't have to buy nothing extra. The trick is whatever u using as a wick u need to soak it in the cooking oil or else the wick will burn. That was my mistake last night. The one I made this morning lasted 3 hours until I decided to play with the wick.
2293 2018-09-13 19:23:11 I was just in as well, my favorite is the baklouti green chili oil...it's awesome!
2294 2018-09-13 19:23:05 I really don’t  and if I do it’s to work and a short 10 mins drive from wherever I’m at. It’s this damn weather and the oil companies messin with gas
2295 2018-09-13 19:23:02 Except because of your ignorance, any gain is more than lost due to inflation. Prices for food, gasoline,  heating oil etc etc.are through the roof.

Yes, i opened both my trunk & gas door instead of the hood but come on.
2298 2018-09-13 19:22:44 Oil companies love saying they have “world class spill response”. When in reality, they have no effective means of cleaning it up. Remember BP and transocean? They also had a world class spill response and what. A disaster that was

2301 2018-09-13 19:22:40 Besides, there's nothing cooked with olive oil that isn't improved with butter.
2302 2018-09-13 19:22:33 The difficulty is overrated. Out of all the cooking oils I've used, olive oil produced the best results.
2303 2018-09-13 19:22:33 You are bragging about new minimum wage jobs replacing oil industry workers who have run out of UI and are no longer counted....shameful fake statistics.  #cndpoli @jkenney @MaximeBernier

2305 2018-09-13 19:22:18 People must be pretty special to not understand that Saudi Arabia is a true enemy. We kiss up to a terrorist supporting regime. Masogynisic regime. Just to get oil. Renewables are our only route to true Independence.
2306 2018-09-13 19:22:06 In addition to being geographically challenged, French people must love tacky lampshades, plaid vests, overbearing service, creepy oil paintings of long-dead oligarchs, and entrees from 1980.
2307 2018-09-13 19:22:05 Whoops I also forgot to mention olive oil and I have it toasted every time 
2308 2018-09-13 19:22:02 Не, не курю. И не собираюсь. Мне то всего шестнадцать, куда курить-то?

2314 2018-09-13 19:21:08 Dude. 
A. 20L of oil should cost [thinks about the size of the universe] like $500. 
B. Impressive carrying, 40lbs weight. But it’s like three armfuls. 
C. It‘d take like two to three My Big Fat Greek Weddings to use all of this
D. Are you selling the excess in the black market?
2315 2018-09-13 19:20:57 You right I forgot you said cheap. 
You can also try the condioner from Argan oil. They have different kinds
2316 2018-09-13 19:20:55 صح لسانك يانهله
2317 2018-09-13 19:20:54 Sir pls compare the crude oil price in international market as well
2318 2018-09-13 19:20:51 Graphite! But it’s either that OR oil; they don’t combine well. Graphite is better in extreme cold IMO.

2324 2018-09-13 19:20:13 As opposed to the general flaunder under you guy's reign. You know, I heard the cons say "We had the best economic growth in the G8" when people were saying it was all fake oil growth. We have the best economy in the G7. What's your argument against that?
2325 2018-09-13 19:20:07 Can’t wait for him to retire

2334 2018-09-13 19:19:07 My brother who is an actual chef swears that you should basically never cook with olive oil.
2335 2018-09-13 19:18:59 Man, we need newer technologies like vegetable oil for cars, electricity, hybrid........ the Finance Bill is from Cartels. Ask President Uhuru Kenyatta if Elianto can be used as car fuel?

2339 2018-09-13 19:18:23 Yes that’s the problem. Food always has a cost. Take expensive fats out and replace with palm oil. Then the cost is health.
2340 2018-09-13 19:18:19 I don't have a problem with that. I always cook with olive oil.
2341 2018-09-13 19:18:10 If you're looking into supplements and don't eat enuff protein, enough Omega-3's oil + get 7-8hr of sleep/night...

You're wasting your money.
2342 2018-09-13 19:18:07 Only 4 that is shit we should have at least 40 we need to up our game we are a massive oil club remember
2343 2018-09-13 19:18:02 Let the various regions create economic policies for themselves

2344 2018-09-13 19:17:48 Then DO something, Jerry. Stop issuing oil permits, establish setbacks between drilling operations and our communities, and help transition the workforce justly to growing clean tech jobs. #BrownsLastChance
2345 2018-09-13 19:17:46 acha. olive oil is good enough then.. :) lemme know how it feels.
2346 2018-09-13 19:17:39 Things you never needed to pack as a man 40 years ago: deodorant, shampoo, beard oil, spare pair of underpants, ...
2347 2018-09-13 19:17:15 Please did you steal the fish and egg? Then bought Tomatoes and begged for oil?
2348 2018-09-13 19:17:12 i can now unbraid, detangle AND oil your hair.AAND i found where the retail shops buy  Amla oil so i now know where to get cheap...smh.. husband material shuwa
2349 2018-09-13 19:17:05 What prices will go up after #HurricaneFlorence2018 — tobacco and pork. #NC is one of top states w hog farms. Gas prices should remain steady, since no oil rigs are in the way.
2350 2018-09-13 19:17:03 The funny part is olive oil is harder to cook with because it has a lower flash point.
2351 2018-09-13 19:16:54 And the government told us all in 2014 that there was no oil left and Scotland would collapse if they voted for independence, and still pains me today that utter idiots actually believed them and Voted NO
2352 2018-09-13 19:16:46 I see your point. There is an end game regarding Iran and their lack of a central bank that operates as the others do. Stealing wealth and controlling money.

The fascination with the middle east is about oil. Perfectly correlates with the motor engine and the two world wars.
2353 2018-09-13 19:16:18 Yeah, that’s the ticket. Let’s destroy our natural wonders and drill for more oil! You get and oil leak and you get an oil spill and you get contaminated water!
Sounds like a great plan. Alert me when you start hunting whales again for lamp oil!

2359 2018-09-13 19:15:55 grey candles are used to neutralize negative energy and to form a protective barrier between negative energy and your space, light with wooden matches and if you want extra protection you could either put eucalyptus oil on your wrist or put the plant next to the candle :)
2360 2018-09-13 19:15:37 So you think its okay for people to be attacked if you don't like them? How did the snake oil salesman earn respect? He hates the American people, especially the ones who see right through him. You know they threatened the President's granddaughter? How is that okay with you?
2361 2018-09-13 19:15:36 Instead of investing in farming in above crops, the (USELESS) agric min claim employing 700,000 peasant farmers in everything except rice/sugar/wheat/cooking oil
We imported $2bil of these items

Hence cedi fall is due to useless ministers

2362 2018-09-13 19:15:35 Even if you don't "believe in" man-made climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions from the use of fossil fuels, you're still neglecting externalities such as castle wars to protect our oil supplies and economical devastating oil spills. You're a fool to push this agenda
2363 2018-09-13 19:15:34 If you can't change brakes, switch out a tire, do a oil change & replaces lights on your own car you will forever get finesse.

2365 2018-09-13 19:14:47 That’s fascinating. Did the pentagon summon @karringtonsc before or after they pulled Bruce Willis off the oil rig to stop the meteor in Armegeddon? 

Your a f-ing joke Gil. 

Run with that theory of yours & see how it pans out.  Please.
2366 2018-09-13 19:14:38  I'm sorry girl.... Allergies m just be awful this year.... Bleh so over it. It's actually better today. Coconut oil and I have be come best buds! Lol. Oil pulling and ibprofin.
2367 2018-09-13 19:14:32 Any Igbo man that vote for APC in 2019 shouod have his brain search for grey matters. The oil is good for all Nigerian but the security appointments is only for a particular region

2369 2018-09-13 19:14:18 Ghana importd $2billion of rice sugar cooking oil wheat in 2017

It's bcos the min of agric has to be FIRed for employing 700,000 peasant farmers

Yet we import food

2373 2018-09-13 19:13:58 millie talking about essential oils is so me, im obsessed with that shit. and it reminded me, i need to buy me another eucalyptus oil bc i ran out!
2374 2018-09-13 19:13:54 Kovalchuk is gonna suck for a lot of cash. Neal is an overpay as well imo. I think the mighty oil will return this year!
2375 2018-09-13 19:13:44 Say what you want,  it the apartheid government saved up that crude oil, so that prices can stay stable. And that prices of food and other stuff stays cheap.
ANC sells it to pocket the money. Goes to show,

2381 2018-09-13 19:12:47 when i’m w/ my dad getting my oil changed they don’t ask to do anything else, but when i’m by myself:
“ma’am i think your engine filter needs changing”
“ma’am you need a new air filter” 
“ma’am would you like a new windshield wiper” 
“ma’am i think you need a whole new vehicle”

2385 2018-09-13 19:12:06 True unless everyone gets hurt....they are making the playoffs and then some.
2386 2018-09-13 19:12:00 Calimari + olives + copious olive oil + m1 = a bad idea!
2387 2018-09-13 19:11:55 Yep. And a good layer of oil at the top to keep the bugs out. Should be fine. Yummy.
2388 2018-09-13 19:11:44 Just made 1st time purchase of CBD oil for my dog. During her lengthy sales pitch, (I was already convinced) salesperson mentions my dog won't get high (yep I get it). While she rattled on I thought, "Hmmmm. Why would that be such a bad side effect. For my dog to be high?" 
2389 2018-09-13 19:11:42 An awareness of a healthy diet can help that.  Foods that have alot of oils will cause acne.  Mixing peanut butter and chocolate is a recipe for oil wells.  Just sayin'.

2400 2018-09-13 19:10:06 @EPA How lovely. I just read that the EPA is set to roll back regulations on methane emissions. And to the benefit of whom?  Let me guess.......the oil and gas industries? It is clear, the EPA is now the Environmental Polluter's Agency.
2401 2018-09-13 19:10:05 I guess moving oil by rail is what you want great. God you people are something else always finding excuses for everything

& Then accidents
2408 2018-09-13 19:09:10 The pipeline, you mean the Canadian project? The one that when it’s done will employee about 50 people? The one a majority of Americans didn’t want, but an “elite” minority is ramming down our throats? I’m sure the Canadians Oil companies appreciate your support.
2409 2018-09-13 19:08:44 Paul Ryan is and always has been a liar. He follows the teachings and principals of Ayn Rand.

2411 2018-09-13 19:08:35 Did Duncan Welby have "principles" when he worked in the Oil industry? The Church of England has an Investment portfolio worth £7.5 billion. Maybe the Archbishop should be putting his money where his mouth is?
2412 2018-09-13 19:07:50 I love eating spinach, especially with olive oil dressing
2413 2018-09-13 19:07:43 I have a few, but my fave is a marinade for grilling. I combine a bit of olive oil, citrus juice (*fresh* lemon, lime or orange) and honey, then add kosher salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, rosemary and oregano. I do it the night before grilling. Wonderful taste.

2418 2018-09-13 19:06:46 It was the first lesson they taught us in art school... "spit in your hand to get the tip on your brush, DO NOT LICK IT" followed by the list of artists who got fucked by their materials.

so of course, I'd sit in the studio smoking while I cut oil paint with acetone. #Idiot
2419 2018-09-13 19:06:45 It wasn't a lemon, Pep Boys messed up my oil change by not putting the plugs back in to keep the oil in.

2427 2018-09-13 19:05:33 Thinking about this, there are people who collect empty oil cans from the early-mid 1900s. So even if it can’t accomplish the task it was created to do anymore, there is still a market for collectors lol

2444 2018-09-13 19:03:06 Inflation has nothing to do with it; it's counterclaim by Tories.
However, you are right, ask them how & they cannot explain but moreover, the inflation rate since 2010 has been under the 3% target.

Also, inflation of the 70s was in double-figures caused by the OPEC oil shock
2445 2018-09-13 19:02:46 One of my favorite case studies in this is the BP oil spill—they ignored everything on SM and they suffered.

2456 2018-09-13 19:01:55 Selfie Scott probably just said, "Go ahead and sign it. Everybody does it and everybody knows everybody does it. It's OK." 

Still scratching my ahead about the oil drilling comment. Everybody knows that @Scotttaylorva oozes crude oil and guns from his dirty money coffers.
2457 2018-09-13 19:01:52 I think it’s important to keep in mind the people who support him, because they will probably support the next turbo moron who shows them some racist snake oil. The problem runs deeper than just turnip.
2458 2018-09-13 19:01:45 Crossing a creek or stream won't hurt spawning fish. If a quad was leaking so much oil it would be a hazard to fish, it wouldn't even run.

2479 2018-09-13 18:59:09 @realDonaldTrump If we see that someone will be exempted from the oil sanctions, we will be back soon and we will see a sharp crackdown. The complete boycott of oil is something we will never miss, it's about our future, do not forget this. Bye

2481 2018-09-13 18:58:57 Tatcha water cream I have oily skin just make sure you wipe away the oils on your face first with an oil blotting sheet before applying it
2482 2018-09-13 18:58:48 Huh! Palm oil?!!
2483 2018-09-13 18:58:41 How well is that oil revenue working out? Inflation? Hooray! Clearly nationalizing industries is "always" a good thing for the people.
2484 2018-09-13 18:58:39 Indeed… and the few who got greedy about the oil…
2485 2018-09-13 18:57:56 Tim's a great guy. The only thing wrong with his statement is that he used Trump and learned in the same sentence. Kinda like mixing oil and water.
2486 2018-09-13 18:57:41 President-elect AMLO said December 2019 will bring tons of oil auctions. I believe refers to oil drilling services called by PEMEX. What do you think?

2492 2018-09-13 18:56:39 Who are we to judge? We are complacent to the white farmers being slaughtered in South Africa. We turn a blind eye to a number of members of OPEC for the benefit of oil. So we support one fellow member of the EU standing up for their belief system amidst EU aggression. #BREXIT
2493 2018-09-13 18:56:28 first of OIL, you ain’t going nowhere sooooo
2494 2018-09-13 18:56:24 Yes. Probably selling more Ayn Rand snake oil.
2495 2018-09-13 18:56:23 Now let’s build more refineries and keep the oil here!!!! #lowermygasbill

2498 2018-09-13 18:56:06 Wait till we start demanding anti trust issues. Standard oil was a playbook.
2499 2018-09-13 18:56:06 Nice! I used to use Bluebeards oil

2505 2018-09-13 18:55:32 I was recently introduced to Avocado oil and I’m so upset because it is underrated! This oil is life guys.

2509 2018-09-13 18:54:55 Regarding that first bullet point...am I missing something? SJ does not have a first rounder in 2019 since they signed Kane to an extension it is now property of the Sabres?
2510 2018-09-13 18:54:41 dude i use an airfryer. no oil. made fish n chips yesterday, crispy as all hell.
2511 2018-09-13 18:54:12 Let me correct you. As an Alberta Oil Field Worker the only thing I'm embarrassed of is our inadequate Canadian Govt. That covers Provincial and Federal.
2512 2018-09-13 18:54:07 I need all my mutuals to send me oil paintings of your cats so I can use them decorate my office in Future Haus.
@Naeko I may need you to use very small canvases.
2513 2018-09-13 18:53:49 Trudeau has adopted every horrific Harper policy. Oil pipelines, Saudi weapons deal, garbage CO2 emissions targets, TPP, corporate tax cut, tax loopholes for billionaires, fighting FN kids over basic meds, electoral reform. 

Harper was trash, JT is trash for following his lead.
2514 2018-09-13 18:53:28 Taylor FINALLY released new sectors for Lucas Oil
2515 2018-09-13 18:53:27 Yep! Liberals already went through the “He’s going to kill women, people on SS and welfare”, “He’s an NRA & Oil company shill” and last week was “He’s a racist” so now they’re going for sexual predator.... they use the same playbook every damn time
2516 2018-09-13 18:53:19 I’ve just found out that I have 25 canvases, 20 drawing pads, oil, watercolor, acrylic colors, pencil colors, I DIDNT NOT USE!
2517 2018-09-13 18:53:18 I'm in charge now: let's sell the strategic oil reserve to my friends. We won't even miss it!

2528 2018-09-13 18:52:18 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
2529 2018-09-13 18:52:13 I live in Siberia and I know that climate change causes permafrost melting. As a result there is deformation of oil pipelines. Climate warming and drying are intensifying the fire regime. Fire disturbance deepens thaw depth and mobilizes permafrost carbon. We’re losing this race

He is drinking all the oil he owns and getting gassy now
2533 2018-09-13 18:51:26 My bolognese has olive oil, garlic, onion, oregano, basil, salt & pepper, burger (sausage texture grosses me out), stewed tomatoes and a little tomato paste to thicken it up. Top with fresh grated Parmesan
2534 2018-09-13 18:50:49 And this somehow justifies increase in petrol prices when the global crude oil prices are still much lower than 2013 levels? Come up with something better!
2535 2018-09-13 18:50:45 I'd rather boil my bollocks in Venezuelan crude oil. Besides I have a diary clash, I have date sight seeing in Salisbury.
2536 2018-09-13 18:50:37 This recipe *does* make a giant vat and I didn't even use a whole head of cabbage! Definitely use sesame oil though, it's a better flavor.

¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
Salt and white pepper to taste  #herbchat
2538 2018-09-13 18:50:36 The woman i bought akara from at the entrance of my estate gate just ruined my dinner. The akara was tasteless, no pepper and it had too much oil(really puts me off), what a waste of money.

2543 2018-09-13 18:50:20 Had to drive to the damn dealership to make an appointment to get my oil changed because they don’t wanna answer the damn phone
2544 2018-09-13 18:50:16 So my @forduk mondeo came up with a warning light saying I to change my oil soon. As it’s a lease car I’m straight on to book it in for a service and the next one available is 5 weeks away. So my question is, what is the max mileage I can do in 5 weeks waiting for an oil change?
2545 2018-09-13 18:50:09  I can’t cope anymore. I’m taking every possible thing I can to numb the pain  don’t buy clove oil it’s fucking disgusting
2546 2018-09-13 18:50:08 Anyone on here actually tried CBD oil/products?
2547 2018-09-13 18:50:08 @OfficialPDPNig can never do better than @APCNigeria .Buhari's ideology would work & fix Nigeria. We just have to trust... No pain no gain... PDP squandered our excess crude oil fund hence the recession faced in the wake of the APC epoch. I stand with APC and believe in Change...
2548 2018-09-13 18:49:49 @Herts_Highways having lost several days to the mini traffic lights on the B5378 I must be entitled to a share of the oil money I can only assume you have been extracting for the past 3 years
2549 2018-09-13 18:49:48 Half a bottle of cooking oil too 
2550 2018-09-13 18:49:38 Human foods are okay in very small portions. And avoid giving it to her daily. Especially at a young age, as she will not learn to eat her treats and foods. If you want, you can boil chicken breast abd broccoli but no added salt or seasoning or oil for a fresh meal sometimes :)
2551 2018-09-13 18:49:35 Harper did an excellent job - He secured Canada's place in the oil sector as well as trade partners - Sadly it has all been ruined as 100 billion in oils trade is now gone as is any hope of a trade respect globally.
2552 2018-09-13 18:49:33 You must like to eat pepper cooked with fish, boiled eggs and oil. 
Brother no onion, tomatoes, maggi,salt ma sef no dey. Brother na her money you dey plan for 
2553 2018-09-13 18:49:30 Because the oil industry wants to export Canadian oil instead of refining it and selling the refined product to Canadians.
2554 2018-09-13 18:49:27 Looks like about 90% of our Canadian oil is exported to the US. Maybe we should turn off the taps until @RealDonad_Trump stops bashing Canada. Just a thought.
2555 2018-09-13 18:49:26 Production may be up but Not all oil production falls under the same royalty regime
2556 2018-09-13 18:49:22 Oil changed real quick then make some runs

2560 2018-09-13 18:48:47 Oil spill
2561 2018-09-13 18:48:37 Just like Turkana oil, the Murang'a County Government has a right to demand a share of its only resource as per the percentages provided by the statutes. Probably, the five percent due to the local community should be provided according. Mafuta na maji no sawa.
2562 2018-09-13 18:48:26 So why is Europe not on ruins? Venezuela was depending on oil revenue
2563 2018-09-13 18:48:17 Foolish Liberals - Scheer is a Blue Tori --- opposite is True - It is unfortunate actually as Harper did an excellent job securing Canada's oil sector and trade place in the world.
2564 2018-09-13 18:48:06 Our gov't paid for this shit to happen, over greed and oil.
2565 2018-09-13 18:48:02 if all we have to offer is oil, we are in big trouble.

2570 2018-09-13 18:47:30 The "they're the same" argument lies in the fact that both parties bring us more fracking & oil pipelines, more wars & imperialism, more shitty 'trade deals', bank bailouts, & tax breaks for the rich & corps., police brutality & ICE.
We demand better but libs ain't listening.
2571 2018-09-13 18:47:23 Really like my barber except lately he's been using a hair oil that makes my head smell like raisins all day
2572 2018-09-13 18:47:15 Well, the mass of the earth at any position varies depending on the mineral make up of the crust. This can be measured. It is used in local tidal calculations accurate to inches and also when surveying for oil and ore deposits.
It is a whole branch of science.

2578 2018-09-13 18:46:21 I agree with you guys. We should not sell oil to China.

2584 2018-09-13 18:45:47 Yeah, I have. I see people from all walks of life who are unfortunately often slaving away for an otherwise nonsustainable future in oil, or businesses tied to the people that are filthy fucking rich and own it. Guess who gets to keep their positions? Not the workers-
2585 2018-09-13 18:45:34 It’s all about the oil type. Conventional oil is 3k, Synthetic is 5k, pure synthetic is up to 8k
2586 2018-09-13 18:45:31 It's still a total mess. We should have taken the oil immediately after the invasion.
2587 2018-09-13 18:45:29 Venezuela has the largest known oil deposits in the world followed by Saudi Arabia.
2588 2018-09-13 18:45:27 Was with a friend today,  I asked him if you don't work for the big 6 oil companies, telecoms, finance houses, multinationals what is really ur future in Nigeria.  What are the odds of even owning ur own home.   Grim thought.
2589 2018-09-13 18:45:19 Because we have already secured their oil. Thank you for backing my point.

2598 2018-09-13 18:44:25 This director of oil company should spend time in understanding how the petrol / diesel prices can be brought down, rather than do policing job..... that is for the other ministry to do. It's time for #BJP to #ReclaimCredibility by stopping #Jumlas

2601 2018-09-13 18:44:11 Same here, but that doesn't make it a wise investment. If you had invested in record companies in the 80's and 90's, that was a losing bet. Now, if you had invested in Itunes, etc., you would be rich.

Same with the USA investing in oil/coal over renewable energy. Bad bet.
2602 2018-09-13 18:44:08 .@HangryKeith 
Fuel prices drop when supply of fuel exceeds demand.  The oil in the ground or not yet refined has no effect on current price.  The consumer knowing bad news will drive up cost raises demand.

2620 2018-09-13 18:42:34 Forgot to ask. What if you wash and apply oil?
2621 2018-09-13 18:42:29 I use coconut oil.  Works great and given to us by Mother Nature
2622 2018-09-13 18:42:17 Wasn't he an oil executive in his former life?
2623 2018-09-13 18:42:12 It is true that when Demand increases Price increases. So instead of controlling Price why don’t we find out ways to control Demand for Oil such as

Jab sabka sath hoga tab desh ka Vikas hoga..What do u think @narendramodi @arunjaitley
2624 2018-09-13 18:42:11 Never forget these two rats got their money from a daddy who happily sold oil to Hitler.
2625 2018-09-13 18:42:09 There's only a small deviation from the estimates the estimates are based on yup. 

How did one of the richest oil countries in Europe end up with emigration, poverty,an estimated deficit,food banks& a Gov it didn't elect dragging it out of a democratic union it voted to stay in?
2626 2018-09-13 18:42:06 Not true for natural gas which the pipeline system is in place for. 

Oil would require a pipeline to Eastern Canada.

2628 2018-09-13 18:42:04 We hold them in my salon so it’s hard for me to say.. I know ulta holds it’s a 10 but i’m not sure about the oil.. try amazon!
2629 2018-09-13 18:41:14 What is silica? 
I use castor and coconut oil for hair growth (works amazing), but now i have a problem mostly with hair loss.
2630 2018-09-13 18:41:12 What's crazy is that this isn't satirical.  This is what they look like and what they actually think and Obama is out there selling the snake oil.
2631 2018-09-13 18:41:08 $50 to change the oil in my truck is ridiculous. i used to be able i to change the oil in my jeep for $25
2632 2018-09-13 18:41:08 tea tree oil!!!! i used it when i got one right after i got it pierced. put some on a cotton ball and place it there for a little every morning and night && mine was gone in less than a week!
2633 2018-09-13 18:41:04 By weakening the EPA’s pollution standards, @EPAAWheeler put oil and gas lobbyists ahead of the health and well-being of hard-working families #CutMethane 
2634 2018-09-13 18:41:01 tried telling ppl but they thought I was lying lol same w coconut oil
2635 2018-09-13 18:40:58 the early retired head teachers on final salary pensions, the wives of oil company execs with six bedroom former parsonages, HR execs with equestrian estates, gites in France, classic cars, husbands with local government pensions all look pretty chipper on their luxury holidays
2636 2018-09-13 18:40:52 Here are just a few that even the media joined in asking is this Obama's Katrina moment:
Ebola:  How many US deaths again?
Unemployment: How many months of job growth?
Swine flu
Avian Bird flu:  May be same as Swine
Obamacare:  Wolf Blitzer questioned
BP Oil Spill

2640 2018-09-13 18:40:40 When shall the Police building at Matayos, opposite National oil operational as a Police station. Its dormant as crimes are on the rise.
2641 2018-09-13 18:40:36 How close will that come to powering the whole thing factories electricity needs? So I can finally tell all the FUD slingers that a @Tesla does not use any oil for the power used to create the cars and the batteries?

Because they often say I have to walk,
when I say give up oil.
2642 2018-09-13 18:40:34 Sometimes my diet triggers a flare. Sometimes it'll be something minute like I changed or bought new hair/oil/fabric. I usually rundown thru those first & if it seems like it's none of those I take an oatmeal or lavender bath. I prefer lavender but it makes me VERY chill.
2643 2018-09-13 18:40:33 you replied to my tweet about it.  I'm making jokes.  Relax!
2644 2018-09-13 18:40:18 Damn I’m out of vegetable oil

2647 2018-09-13 18:39:54 I wouldn't be surprised if my Lyft driver last night gave me a low rating. He asked me precisely one (1) question about engine oil and I proceeded to talk nonstop for the next 15 minutes about it.
2648 2018-09-13 18:39:53 Sana oil HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
2649 2018-09-13 18:39:50 And you abandoned oil refineries and started building new one in your state. You must debate

2654 2018-09-13 18:39:21 Aha, How did one of the richest oil countries in Europe end up with emigration, poverty, an estimated deficit, food banks & a government it didn't elect dragging it out of a democratic union it voted to stay in?
2655 2018-09-13 18:39:19 "I don't have money or time to waste on burning oil for no reason, circling parking lots like an angry wasp, paying for massive road projects just for unnecessary car use, buying groceries "in bulk," or fighting to oppress people who don't have cars" ... What's wrong with you?
2656 2018-09-13 18:39:14 This is me at my dad’s. Same with olive oil.

2659 2018-09-13 18:39:01 Why not Canada to stupid to sell oil
2660 2018-09-13 18:38:53 Please oh. Is very possible. Pepper, Maggi, oil, salt and co were already at home. She only bought eggs and kerosene. Lemme run to the loo. The pepper I'm looking at is making my stomach run. There's no tomato at all in that stew oh
2661 2018-09-13 18:38:52 Mom: where are you going?

2666 2018-09-13 18:38:20 its almost the same you get from Gulf oil and Saudi telecom.
2667 2018-09-13 18:38:17 @Thomas, while no doubt the data is a top priority, the  problem is that you can't drive your vehicle or fly a plane if no oil is available :)
2668 2018-09-13 18:38:10 Fact is oil price can't be controlled by any govt's coz its a huge business. Cutting taxes is an option when majority of citizens are honest tax payers. In India less than 2% of our humongous population pay tax. Any govt will struggle to balance things especially given our size
2669 2018-09-13 18:37:49 My favourite is Lavender ,sedative, antispasmodic, anti-anxiety, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antibacterial, anesthetic,  immune-boosting, and antiviral.I use it 50-50 mix of half lavender oil, half carrier oil & it goes best for me #PositiveThinkingDay #Organic
2670 2018-09-13 18:37:49 Yeah I think the oil industry has made a few bucks in the last 30 years.
2671 2018-09-13 18:37:37 You're missing the point of the 2 being completely unrelated.  Go write a letter about it!
2672 2018-09-13 18:37:32 I've had some days off from running. I've done calisthenics only and cbd oil. My body has not felt this good in ages.

2675 2018-09-13 18:37:21 Infrastructure, big difference!

Oil? Gas? Water? infrastructure. It belongs to the people, and therefore the people should benefit from them. 

Nat'l Guard in, take control, pro accountants and advisors, profits to The State, and its people. Done. All's well, everyone's happy!
2676 2018-09-13 18:37:14 P.s the misogyny I made reference to was not in your explanation. What I said, was that one who is already a pawn of misogyny would see nothing wrong with the tweet.
2677 2018-09-13 18:37:09 Yes, at the time we needed their oil, they had a choke hold on us. We could not allow Saddam H. to take control of Saudi Arabia our major oil supplier. However, that doesn't change the rest of the statement. I said that was ONE OF THE REASONS. Your statement is partially correct.
2678 2018-09-13 18:37:04 It made me want to give myself a hot oil treatment ngl

2681 2018-09-13 18:36:33 We got a stove top at our shop and I was so hyped to cook eggs this morning. Maybe too hyped, bc instead of using canola oil, I accidentally used engine oil...we didn’t even realize my fuck up till after everybody ate some

2687 2018-09-13 18:35:41 Why wouldn't "Nigeria" be heavily indebted? When the people in charge of running the economy affair of this country, lack the strategies to make proper uses of the funds we generated from the crude oil.

2696 2018-09-13 18:34:37 Yeah, I'm going to sit in the lounge and watch geology lectures while I get an oil change, my TL is stupid today
2697 2018-09-13 18:34:36 We’re not clawing back industry from recklessly running roughshod over officials and throwing them a couple bucks/incentives to look the other way, either through bribery, job offers or blacklisting. Wall Street, Big Pharma and Oil industry are primary examples.

2699 2018-09-13 18:34:17 @narendramodi with the ever increasing oil prices (international) and India's mission to use clean fuel, can we start enforcing the sale of electric vehicles and incentivice solar panels in the country. Two objectives achieved with one shot
2700 2018-09-13 18:34:15 Clueless.... do panels move oil?

2710 2018-09-13 18:32:30 what effect? Can you explain how previous govt can affect oil prices? UPA was being sponsored by Saudis and hence Modi threatened with consequences which made them ameliorate. India got increased FDI and oil prices were also lowered to help India improve its economy from UPA rule
2711 2018-09-13 18:32:18 Better why not 

1.nationalize all stratigic assets . ( Energy , oil, coal, mining , spectrum etc)

2.implement equal distribution of farm land ( pending ) form cooperatives .

3.ensure 10 % additional tax on 5 % of top wealth owners.

4.ensure minimum wages
2712 2018-09-13 18:32:12 Exactly. Is tech/digital/coding good/necessary may be an interesting thought experiment, but outside of some peak-oil-type apocalypse that's all it is. IMO, we should put our energies into adapting to/shaping what we have. #humanities #ethics #pedagogy #engl673mu

2719 2018-09-13 18:31:40 19th of May 2013, ex-Labour chancellor Denis Healey stated: "I think we did underplay the value of the oil to the country because of the threat of nationalism. I think they are concerned about Scotland taking the oil, I think they are worried stiff about it."
2720 2018-09-13 18:31:27 If there is such an understanding, how is the US Government planning to get such a wide range of oil producers to follow through?
2721 2018-09-13 18:31:20 Tbh I have never read something more conceited than this paragraph yours in my life. Yes! I identify as a northerner, but I am Muslim first and foremost. Islam does not permit me to be tribalistic, therefore I will not stand for it. I am not better than anybody.
2722 2018-09-13 18:31:17 My sources on the picture says it's near the Long Beach area but they'll try to confirm. One thing to know most gas stations are on the property owned by the oil company for years. That might help you in your search

2741 2018-09-13 18:29:34 I feel so genuinely sorry for those people. As a country sitting on the world's largest proven oil reserves, they should be an incredibly wealthy and prosperous country. I bet Venezuelans never thought voting for a socialist government could have such a catastrophic outcome.
2742 2018-09-13 18:29:22 I want everyone to know that I just went alone to get my oil changed and everyone there was very nice and not rude at all. It is possible!!! Don’t give up, ladies!!

2744 2018-09-13 18:29:05 One also probably has to ask what is cause of inflation? Is it fiat currency down- if so all prices rise - stocks up. In 1973 opec shock: all costs rise, margins fall: oil stocks rise, everything else falls.

2749 2018-09-13 18:28:51 Thanks! Meat fondue means you cook the meat over a boiling container of either oil or broth/wine. (I had the latter) thin strips of meat, then you dip the cooked meat in a sauce. Yummy. Most famous is cheese fondue, w/bubbling cheese over a flame, dipping bread!
2750 2018-09-13 18:28:49 They’re buying the world’s resources.   The Chinese are all over Africa.  Building roads, investing in mining & making chiefs happy. Now they want the Venezuelan oil - there’s an abundance of it. The Chinese aren’t stupid, for sure.

Slowly but surely, we will get there, just that some of us expect long age deficit in all sectors,to be covered within 3yrs(even considering the fact we had a year of almost no revenue from oil cos of the sharp drop in oil price and ND menace)..#Saibaba
2755 2018-09-13 18:28:41 Is it truly a week at Northeast if I'm not going to the dentist and @GarrettThorn isn't getting his oil changed?
2756 2018-09-13 18:28:26 Oh, So the protesters aren’t all oil executives? (LOL) #Sarcasm
2757 2018-09-13 18:28:12 That is why you use organic tea tree oil and dilute it with a heavy oil carrier.. these beauty products that use tea tree oil have a minuscule amount of tea tree oil and pack full of harmful chemicals.I personally prefer manuka essential oil .
2758 2018-09-13 18:28:06 As I have said prior to this. I will not be surprised if you are unable to sense it
2759 2018-09-13 18:28:03 the fear of the palm oil stain on your easter clothes is the beginning of wisdom. 

-africans everywhere.
2760 2018-09-13 18:27:59 Fair enough, If politics can be exported for income generation, it'll pass crude oil as our major export.
2761 2018-09-13 18:27:36 Yes it does alot.
I started using it 2month ago and i noticed significant improvement.
Give it a try. Also try olive oil and coconutoil in addition
2762 2018-09-13 18:27:36 Man, you drive me crazy!!!!!!!!!!!! accusing US of the domestic policy of Iraq oil? Which Iraq is making a lot of money?
Where do you learn all this bullshit? On Friday at the Mosque? 
I wish you get ruled by China or Russia - they you'll understand a thing or two.
2763 2018-09-13 18:27:27 You forgot the beef dripping...olive oil, a thing of the past
2764 2018-09-13 18:27:11 Only under the deal its the oil companies who own the oil. Government sells the licences and takes revenue in the form of tax on profit, corporation tax and Petroleum Revenue Tax (though this has been set at 0% since 2016)

2767 2018-09-13 18:27:01 Fun Fact: That big blot in North Dakota is from oil refineries burning natural gas because nobody knows what to do with it for profit.
2768 2018-09-13 18:26:38 Those spit roast chickens we do on the BBQ. We don’t eat them all... promise. Take the legs off, freeze them. 

Cut up some small leftover potatoes in to wedges, olive oil them, give some herb/seasoning, get some baked beans, add some brown sauce and pepper.

2770 2018-09-13 18:26:08 Also what diplomacy caused the oil price fall?
2771 2018-09-13 18:26:04 Has the oil been rubbing off on him all this time or did he move through it too quickly?

2791 2018-09-13 18:23:57 I go up to my dad’s house and cook a few times a year. There, it’s always olive oil and basil.

2793 2018-09-13 18:23:27 Don Canada has larger oil deposits than Russia but extracts less. Russia's deposits will be depleted in 22 years while Canada's can last for 100 years if they continue extracting at the same rate.

2799 2018-09-13 18:22:38 You expect BC to risk multiple livelihoods and industries for your oil, to countries that wont be buying in the first place with the VLCCs theyve built. AB bitumen isnt for Canadian consumption, it's to sell to Asian markets that no longer need it as they have better options now.

2810 2018-09-13 18:21:38 I have found it baffling that targeted cuts to programs has barely been mentioned during the latest JIL-freakout. Still hearing that humanities PhDs are good because of the good they do; the same as oil companies insisting that more CO2 is great because plants'll grow better.
2811 2018-09-13 18:21:26 Correct: GERMAN - Soviet Alliance.

Hitler's conquest of France ran on Soviet oil, the same for Battle of Britain, even tanks invading Soviet Union ran on Soviet oil.
Without it he had no chance.

2816 2018-09-13 18:20:36 I would go with aromatherapy.. rub him with sweet orange oil... it is satisfying in another way  as eating may not be an option. I did this for my Dad in his last weeks and it helped.
2817 2018-09-13 18:20:34 More whataboutism. YOURE trying to penalize the rest of the country for a fledgling product and industry. How many billions has Big Oil in Alberta gotten from the Fed Gov over the years in subsidies??? How much has that damaged the rest of the country?
2818 2018-09-13 18:20:30 We all need to make the RSPO take action -- as Indofood’s business partners Pepsi and Nestlé are more interested in skirting around their #palmoilpromises, while leaving in loopholes the size of Indonesia, than sourcing truly sustainable palm oil. @PepsiCo @Nestle @indofood

2823 2018-09-13 18:20:00 #C4News the price of oil is at a 4 year high. Any sanctions are going to have less impact. The RT interview was typically... Russian. Nothing to see hear. Must work for some people of there. I wouldn't want to believe my country could do that either. #Putin #FakeNews
2824 2018-09-13 18:19:51 think about it 100 MMMillion barrels of oil per DAY 
how long can mother earth support the increase in consumption.
we are ill prepared renewable wise for the inevitable outcome
I really hope Gregor is rite about the future of consumption.
2825 2018-09-13 18:19:40 Funny thing yeah venezuela is actually rich in oil
2826 2018-09-13 18:19:26 I haven't. Undercurrents of moralizing are all over media criticism now but, socially, moral framework has shifted. Some say "flipped" but it's similar.

I view propaganda/agenda, to manipulate against own well-being, as bad. Snake oil might give hope but generally a false one.

An oil spill by a private company got more coverage than a natural disaster with ton of lead time to react. 

But that’s because GOP is simply better at convincing your colleagues to keep certain items in the news.
2832 2018-09-13 18:18:37 I remember the headlines well..Feb 2016...oil going $10

2837 2018-09-13 18:18:30 It's not about stealing the oil or taking the oil per se it's about controlling the global oil market.
Same reason you have protestors funded by other oil companies (or their owners) to protest pipelines.
They are not anti-pipeline or anti-oil, their for control.
2838 2018-09-13 18:18:15 Yes much better to import the Oil thousands of miles from other countries, keeps the carbon footprint higher so we can all use our cars, use our mobile phones, use domestic appliances, not forgetting our essential medicines, oh and many country folk need it for their heating.
2839 2018-09-13 18:18:13 The US is forcing India to stop buying oil from Iran. India should also force the US to stop sending security related aids to Pakistan. The 2+2 Dialogue is a complete butchery. @narendramodi @rajnathsingh

And I dont like the findings.
Even the most transparent are absurd. Like the Billions a year to Israel. That alone could send a lot of people to school. 
We spend more to incarcerate than to educate.
The subsidies to Big Oil that dont trickle down to lower gas prices,  etc.

2862 2018-09-13 18:16:03 On 911, the day we remember 3000 Americans dying in a terrorist attack, Donald Trump gives himself an A+ for his response to Puerto Rico where 3000 Americans died, calling it "an unsung success."  What kind of self consumed, delusional, soulless snake oil salesman does that?
2863 2018-09-13 18:16:01 It will be done one by one.  Now only repaid the loan of Rs.2.00 L crore which was the oil loan executed by the congress government. Now constructing storage like abroads to face the rate fluxuation

2871 2018-09-13 18:15:21 Cbd oil had helped my mom so much. She needs a hip replacement at the age of 50 and since I got her some oil and cream she wakes up with no pain or limp! She is so happy. She was on so many pain meds that didnt even help just made her feel sick. I'm glad cbd isnt illegal

2892 2018-09-13 18:13:07 This is amazing news for America! I do remember the great days when America was the largest oil producer! So glad to see positive things happening in spite of the enormous amount of FAKE NEWS being spewed by Dem & Lib MSM & Press who are actually Dem Operatives themselves!

2899 2018-09-13 18:12:30 Most politicians will say just about anything to make you believe in them.  They have so many different opinions and interpretations of facts  that we cant help but feel overwhelmed when we need to vote. Please for the sake of our sanity, dont put a snake oil salesman in charge.
2900 2018-09-13 18:12:27 You look like oil tycoon.. That's why they charge 5k ....

-@CBECal & Wilmington residents who live with 5 oil refineries within a few miles' radius

2903 2018-09-13 18:12:07 Well actually no not these days. The volume of oil and coal India and China burn daily is scarey enough and a volcano these days only equates to around 6 months worth.

 I know what it means. It's the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port. It has the capacity to service tankers 4x the size of Vancouver Port's capability. Asia has been building super tankers for 10 yrs in anticipation...
2912 2018-09-13 18:11:18 I speak to every parent who dreams for their whole lives and other things, the oil is right? I'm building one of the big area?
2913 2018-09-13 18:11:17 Is there an essential oil for getting people to shut the fuck up?

3,we are not,,BJP govt against farmers ,
Bjp import sugar from Pakistan but our sugarcane farmers protest for their dues
2915 2018-09-13 18:11:02 @DanielJHannan Why have you not written an article in the Telegraph, or tweeted, to explain why you and your fellow Conservatoids voted in support of Hungarian fascist Viktor Orban?

Surely you can sprinkle some patented Hannan snake oil on it to make it seem plausible to idiots?

2918 2018-09-13 18:10:49 How is this different from subsidies for oil industry?
2919 2018-09-13 18:10:41 Kind of obvious that you need to cut production of oil and gas in tandem with cutting carbon production.
2920 2018-09-13 18:10:36  You are right. I apologize to the "used car salesmen." To compare them to Trump was insulting and disrespectful. Is it be okay to use "snake oil salesmen?"

2927 2018-09-13 18:09:15 Colorado has some of the lowest utility rates in the country. Why? Natural gas in our backyard. Tell the poor people who can barely afford the low rates now what they’re supposed to do when (if oil and gas were banned - what 112 would do) they’re rates triple.
2928 2018-09-13 18:09:12 We would be admired if we stop trying to sanction people out of the global market for selling oil in non-USD, SMH
2929 2018-09-13 18:09:07 That order of rate fixing right to individual oil companies by congress government
2930 2018-09-13 18:08:59 GP Will you run the tractor without oil in it? Got to do that.
2931 2018-09-13 18:08:40 it angers me to no end that my grandpa's doctor refuses to advocate the use of CBD oil to treat his Parkinson's. 

He insists that prescribed Sinemet is a better choice even tho it gives him migraines, nausea and insomnia.

2940 2018-09-13 18:08:04 Quite possibly in isolation. I'm coming from a financial oil perspective & just trying to reconcile completely bonkers 'hedge fund' narratives for oil & product managed money open interest with reality of physical market flows & OPEC bullshit

2946 2018-09-13 18:07:38 Apple is like that consummate madaari par excellence that you saw in your village mela (fair) who put on quite a show and managed to con the gullible villagers into buying snake oil and cure for mardaana kamzori. How does it even get away with this scam?
2947 2018-09-13 18:07:31 At least I don't mass murder foreign kids for being born on top of oil deposits, amiright?

MY BIG SIN WAS ACCURATELY SUMMARIZING THAT RAYTHEON MAKES SHITTY FUCKING AIRPLANES.

2954 2018-09-13 18:06:52 I just bought a cool new Playstation 4 Benghazi has nothing to do with a man named Ben Gahzi! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
2955 2018-09-13 18:06:44 Y shouldn't take action against Oil companies ! And u r d director too ! We are helpless 
2956 2018-09-13 18:06:43 @JasonLawhead I've got a Brussels sprout recipe you might like. Chop off the stub and cut them in half. Toss in olive oil with salt, pepper, and a diced shallot. Top it with bacon or panchetta. Bake it in the oven at 425for 45min and stir it up every 15min. Goes nice with steak

2960 2018-09-13 18:06:20 Please share a pic of the Oil please
2961 2018-09-13 18:06:18 Jerry Brown’s California will never be able to meet those goals as long as we continue on the path of false market solutions and don’t hold the oil industry accountable for its crimes against our communities. #BrownsLastChance

2967 2018-09-13 18:05:14 Trump: Why should US pay for German defense against Russia if it gets its oil from Russia?

Juncker: Why should Europe pay for oil in US dollars when oil comes from Russia?

Europe stops using dollars for oil payments and US stops funding German defense 

Art of the Non Deal!

2972 2018-09-13 18:04:43 Our place has a fancy coffee machine.
When I go for an oil change, I take in some donuts to share w/ the folks working,
then sample every single flavor of their cap/frap/mochas myself.

2982 2018-09-13 18:03:17 That’ll make it easier to get   to all the oil & gas reserves. That should keep me in a job for a few years then  
2983 2018-09-13 18:03:16 Northern BC should have a referendum and leave the hippies the south. Then the North annex with Alberta because they are mostly oil and gas minding hard workers.

2990 2018-09-13 18:02:22 Very over hygienic pakoras. The napkins are to be dispensed with the next time. See oil, believe oil.

2995 2018-09-13 18:02:04 In short, our premier is a shameless liar who is funneling the tax burden to municipalities because he and his party neglected to plan for any economic environment that didn't include $100 per barrel oil prices.

2998 2018-09-13 18:01:41 @DailyMailUK @BBCWatchdog @AudiUKCare @TheSun @whatcar After questioning how Audi justify over £350 for an oil change they have just confirmed their garages can effectively charge what they want, as they are franchised! What nonsense. #Don’t tell McDonald’s!
2999 2018-09-13 18:01:37 I own 10 acres of undeveloped land outside of Lancaster. My grandfather bought it in the 1940s on a hot tip that it had oil. Still waiting! LOL.

3003 2018-09-13 18:01:06 high fat is the way to go (not including vegetable oils like soybean oil, corn oil, canola oil peanut oil). unlike carbs & proteins, fats don’t raise insulin and have a near zero insulin index. all ur metabolic syndrome goes away when u keep insulin low at all time.
3004 2018-09-13 18:00:57 thanks. it was actually my first (and only) oil painting. "The Art of Dragonlance" was my visual bible back in high school.  Thanks for your tweet that reminded me of it.

3015 2018-09-13 17:59:58 I couldn't. And I'd spent close to P200 there
My options were pizza or oil ya KFC, I had ice cream and went to bed
3016 2018-09-13 17:59:57 Oh no! I used to get these a LOT so I’m giving you unsolicited advice. Steaming with eucalyptus essential oil really helps.

3024 2018-09-13 17:59:20 If the @realDonaldTrump administration is so pro Energy, then why is gas so expensive?

3025 2018-09-13 17:58:58 "Take 3P’s other brilliant idea, the creation of a sovereign-wealth fund built on oil revenues and modeled after Norway’s trillion-dollar pension fund." 
This is wrong in a couple of ways.

3029 2018-09-13 17:58:34 The US cannot brazenly attack Yemen for its oil reserves, so they use Saudi Arabia as a proxy. A policy was in place long before the current administration, who inherited it, and is prevented from changing it until it becomes useless as a news item to divert Americans’ attention.
3030 2018-09-13 17:58:32 Yeah the AA saved me, numpty here hadn't checked her oil in yonks and the engine started smoking 
3031 2018-09-13 17:58:22 This has nothing to do with tunnels, the tunnels aren't even operational yet, the bottom line is if people of Turkana are paid for their oil the people of Murang'a must be paid for their water

3035 2018-09-13 17:58:06 With that five-week delayed medical ship sitting idle because they weren't given any orders about how to get people on board, etc.  

But the US lifted the Jones Act so Russia can drill for oil off Cuba for Venezuela.

3038 2018-09-13 17:58:02 A LIL TOO OILY but otherwise really good!! I subbed a few things in the recipe, I was out of baking powder so I used molasses and extra baking soda and put brown sugar in for the white sugar. I'd def make them again with less oil and more Greek yogurt
3039 2018-09-13 17:57:45 I’ve already gotten an oil change and a flu shot today, so I think I’ve earned the right to do fuck all for the rest of the day.
3040 2018-09-13 17:57:40 No matter who won in 2016, we were gonna end up with most corrupt, crooked POS in history. 

And neoliberal Democrats LOVE the Citizen's United decision, just ask Tom Perez. Citizen's United is what is allowing them to take all that shady oil and bank money.
3041 2018-09-13 17:57:30 Everyday enormous CN CP Trains roll into Vancouver area with, OIL tank cars from one end to the other.  No pipeline, no room for grain etc. on the trains
3042 2018-09-13 17:57:27 You should propose the new strategy that all fuel companies must produce fuel from coal this will in turn create extra mining jobs this crap of crude oil things must stop synthetic fuel all the way, it can be cheaper until we finish coal deposits
3043 2018-09-13 17:57:25 So fracking and oil interests aren’t outsiders then? Or because they fund you it’s okay for them to destroy the environment there
3044 2018-09-13 17:57:23 Great, clean sound
Easy upgrade path through Bob Crites

Small amount of sanding and oil goes a long way to restoring
3045 2018-09-13 17:57:22 As usual, “oil” gets mixed up in the debate with “gas”. Its quite technical, but apparently theyre different things
3046 2018-09-13 17:57:04 If you believe that, then I have a great deal for you. Buy one can of snake oil, get a handful of magic beans absolutely free!

3051 2018-09-13 17:56:22 Is it traded on the global commodities market? And does it trade by the barrel like oil? #WhatILearnedToday #Mojo50
3052 2018-09-13 17:56:21 Only something like 10% of Norwegians are employed in SOEs. The percent of the economy under govt control looks inflated because oil revenues are so enormous relative to Norways small population. I believe something like 60 points of that 80% is their national oil company.
3053 2018-09-13 17:55:55 no more blood for oil
3054 2018-09-13 17:55:50 Where can I get unadulterated coconut oil in Uyo?
3055 2018-09-13 17:55:40 Good. Let oil markets crumble.

3065 2018-09-13 17:54:02 turmeric magic and anti cancer , you should always add half a a teaspoon of black pepper to turmeric and it is not water soluble so mix a quarter of a cup of olive oil half a teaspoon of black pepper and about 5 grams of turmeric

3067 2018-09-13 17:53:21 Organic jaggery is the best. Hope Indian sugarcane farmers switch to organic farming, restart traditional jaggery making units. 

In small towns we had oil ghanas (ox run grinders), where they produced more healthy oil (when owners didn't resort to adulteration). We need them.
3068 2018-09-13 17:53:16 Oil is skyrocketing as WS traders hike it up because if hurricane which is NOT in Gulf. Unbridled greed which will force poor/elderly to shiver or freeze to death in homes because they can't afford heating oil.

3070 2018-09-13 17:52:57 In the beginning you’ll spend more money as you buy up your herbs,spices, sauce, oil etc. Mine is £60-£80 and that’s for 2 adults & a child. Best thing to do is plan your meals for the week and make a list. Lidl & Aldi are the cheapest shops. And don’t shop when you’re hungry! 
3071 2018-09-13 17:52:56 How did one of the richest oil countries in Europe end up with emigration, poverty, an estimated deficit, food banks & a government it didn't elect dragging it out of a democratic union it voted to stay in?
3072 2018-09-13 17:52:48 British people just love culling badgers. They go absolutely ape for badger culls. Nothing they enjoy more than finding a badger sett and pouring boiling oil into it and spearing the fleeing critter with a halberd or lance. That’s British culture

3080 2018-09-13 17:52:01 Saudi Arabia is a torrorist country. I'm happy to hear it, only if the U.S. keeps the oil at home to make us stronger and not export it.

3093 2018-09-13 17:50:35 Car wash, oil change and a full tank of gas literally made me so happy

3110 2018-09-13 17:49:00 There was a rural crime wave a couple of years ago, likely related to the collapse of oil prices. I blame criminals who lived off the oil boom, barely noticed. Then they got fired/evicted, and moved on to exploiting rural people. It seems to be abating in the places I know.
3111 2018-09-13 17:48:58 I'd ask who Ted Cruz is going to have perform at his rally, but then I remembered that Cruz doesn't have rallies, just meetings with oil companies. #BetoForTexas #Beto

3115 2018-09-13 17:48:24 Made my first tincture over the weekend, discovered that its got good body and potency but glycerin makes for a very sweet product.  I may need to move to a more topical based oil to get what I need. One step closer to my own grow.

3118 2018-09-13 17:47:57 May our waterfalls never look like this. Oil makes a rainbow sheen on water. Lets talk about other sources of wealth besides shallow short sighted money ,and out of control me too, fear and or greed based capitalism.
3119 2018-09-13 17:47:53 greet....but our oil is banned from u.s . The middle east countries just have to sell oil .
3120 2018-09-13 17:47:52 Take a deep breath; oil, natural gas and gasoline are transported by pipelines. Are you trying to say that it's only gas pipelines that should be stopped?
3121 2018-09-13 17:47:50 They use peanut oil to fry that chicken, Shelton. People forget that. Healthier than other fast foods. Kinda like a mini diet. Don’t be so hard on yourself.
3122 2018-09-13 17:47:45 Denmark has more natural resources than Wales.. oil.. gas to name but two. We are not in the same league sadly.
3123 2018-09-13 17:47:38 Take the steak out, pat it dry, season, and sear it very quickly on the very hottest thing you can find. I sear in a cast-iron skillet on high heat, with a thin layer of oil; when the oil starts to wisp, I put it in for thirty seconds on a side. Other people use a blowtorch.
3124 2018-09-13 17:47:36 I’ve been taking cbd oil for a little over a month & it’s honestly made a HUGE difference in my life. Im hoping it helps me in a couple weeks for my wedding cause holy anxiety! Im so happy it’s been able to help you too! 
3125 2018-09-13 17:47:26 @AudiUKCare @BBCWatchdog @whatcar the arrogance of Audi staggers me. Apparently charging over £350 for an oil change is all because of the quality of their parts? Nothing to do with ripping customers off with fixed arrangements and zero customer loyalty.
3126 2018-09-13 17:47:24 I really need a new house. I have lived in my apartment for 19 years and I need a new start. A dream car would also be very nice as mine leaks oil.
3127 2018-09-13 17:47:15 So I’ve been getting this amazing ass face wash of mine in tea tree oil, went back to the store to re up on some more, to see they now have it in Grapefruit tooo
3128 2018-09-13 17:47:09 Yes. And this veins blockage can be due to any reason. I know my friend's mom. She goes on walk twice a day since last 10-15 years. Unke ghar mein sab kam namak masaaley ka khaana and all food cooked in olive oil. Pure Veg. Unki bhi 2 blocked thi. Doctor said reason is stress.

3130 2018-09-13 17:46:54 CBD oil is great I agree with this
3131 2018-09-13 17:46:48 I thought the reason they are considered not halal is because they refilter their oil so you don’t know if it’s been used on meat products 
3132 2018-09-13 17:46:46 Coconut oil..black castor oil..argan oil..jojoba oil..EVERYTHING  my hair be super dry..like when I wash it and oil my curls POP but not for long its like my hair soaks the shit up so fast 
3133 2018-09-13 17:46:44 No. But I bet oil companies from all over are. That's who he cares about. His donations come from companies. His vote go toward helping those companies.
3134 2018-09-13 17:46:37 The real MVP.  Big oil probably pumps the gas price up in these circumstances.

3151 2018-09-13 17:45:24 No, the label is for >=500. I use it to replace my routine fish oil supplements.  At $9/m co-pay, it's much cheaper than buying supplements.

3157 2018-09-13 17:44:58 My anxiety has gotten 10000% better ever since I got crystals (which could definitely be a placebo thing) and cbd oil  it’s mind boggling to me still how a plant is still so frowned upon - but I get it.

3168 2018-09-13 17:43:46 speaking of.  Change my oil scott
3169 2018-09-13 17:43:46 I second that, and mainland Americans vote too.  We cannot allow potus to destroy the mainland for oil and money.

3171 2018-09-13 17:43:32 "There's something on fire inside you. Women know this. They 'smell something burning' and they want to put it out. 

Though there will only be one, now and again, who will want to throw oil on it."
3172 2018-09-13 17:43:21 Ok but certain tax credits are given out for specific business expenses that relate only to oil and gas companies. The oil they want is already in Canada not somewhere else, if they want it they have to do business here. So why do we need to give them the incentives?
3173 2018-09-13 17:43:08 I didn't want to be the first to say it. The eggs and quantity of oil > N300.
3174 2018-09-13 17:43:01 Feed my ducks with oil? Are you stupid?? #koulzbot
3175 2018-09-13 17:42:58 Lmaoo I just got off so I’m about to pack go get my oil changed and then come . I should be there around 6
3176 2018-09-13 17:42:48 Not a bad idea. Although it's more oil than juice at the bottom.
3177 2018-09-13 17:42:46 Are you a business that employs human people? Or are you a human people yourself? Either way, I strongly advise bringing in @TheCalmPeople to help you identify & address the root causes of stress & negative core beliefs which could be holding you back. No witchcraft or snake oil.
3178 2018-09-13 17:42:36 It’s quite apparent that they want to starve out our Oil & Gas industry regardless of what they keep repeating. Delays, excuses, distractions and complacency are not the actions typically taken when you say you “support” an industry.

3180 2018-09-13 17:42:08 I experienced the full range of SSRIs, so I know what you mean! In my opinion CBD oil isn’t the way, it’s a form of THC oil which is needed! I truly hope the U.K. progresses so it’s freely available to try (and help)
3181 2018-09-13 17:42:05 I just mostly wanted to make a DVC joke! (Also the platform design was taken from an oil rig)

3184 2018-09-13 17:41:51 So I came in to get an oil change and to get a sensor checked out and my service dude went “ does it go doo doo doo?” And I was like “no it’s more of a honking” and he goes but still doo doo doo right?”

Question is whether this means that CA should just get our oil from Texas, Saudi Arabia and Russia. Or whether we use CA as a model to develop better safety and environmental practices.

3212 2018-09-13 17:38:05 "What are some deal breakers  you might have with a job?" my  therapist asked me two days ago having  now worked for Amazon for over  three years...  

"Uh... If they forgot to pay me for a straight month."   

"But you get paid biweekly"  

"Yeah, so?"
3213 2018-09-13 17:37:56 It takes nine months, then you 'snip' and start again... Funny thing is, I just sprayed for 'whitefly' with neem oil this morning. Then your post.

3222 2018-09-13 17:37:12 I remember the one time the Ques on campus had chicken and oil for homecoming for the Pre-game at Red mile. I dont remember much after leaving that  pre-game 
3223 2018-09-13 17:37:04 Once again we are in agreement.

Our unnecessary intervention in the middle east has not been good. It is also not needed since we can drill for our own oil and dig for our own coal.

Moreover it doesn’t require the blood of innocent people.
3224 2018-09-13 17:37:01 I'll bet you wouldn't be in favor of having an oil well sitting 500 ft. from your house.

3228 2018-09-13 17:36:40 The transmission system and commodities markets make a rapid boycott of US oil gas impossible. Yes, I'd agree with an initiative towards minimizing all imports, as much as possible, targeting 15 years from now. Many changes and disruptions will be underway then...

The EU should stop paying for planes and oil in dollars. The trouble is that markets know all about the shaky foundations of the euro and foresee a eurocrisis.

I put a couple drops of tea tree oil and olive oil (mixed) in my ear and it’s so much better!

What the hell is going on.
3240 2018-09-13 17:35:24 Day 4
Shampoo'd hair like normal, no conditioner. Hair feels less heavy and was easy to comb through.
I'm not gonna lie, I feel greasy AF from all this oil inside & out but I'm not dry at all, anywhere. 
Ive lost 1/2 lb from doing nothing. Just doing my regular routine.
3241 2018-09-13 17:35:23 Really strange to get used to, felt like oil on the brush but applied well, you can be fairly generous with it, 2 coats possibly 3 if desired in the day. I’m going to put an extra coat on said piece of fascia see if it looks any different. In laws place so can keep an eye on it !
3242 2018-09-13 17:34:54 Why don’t Syrian refugees go to oil rich countries like Saudi Arabia or uae ? Why don’t they help their fellow Muslims?
3243 2018-09-13 17:34:21 Alberta we r laughing stock! How sad to see the hatred for the Oil Patch that gave so much $$$ to the East - and they hate us!
3244 2018-09-13 17:33:59 The travelling Wilburys said it best- "you don't need no oil change, you're smooth enough for me".  You've got killer legs.
3245 2018-09-13 17:33:55 I agree Mr Profit....wait.......and wait. 
3246 2018-09-13 17:33:53 Can't bring eggs in my house :( Will try the olive oil tip, thank you! :)
3247 2018-09-13 17:33:53 Macadamia nut oil really might be the most compatible with my combination skin. Omg.....its 130 and I'm not greasy asf!
3248 2018-09-13 17:33:48 Ima leave that oil shit to you niggas I ain’t built for it. 
3249 2018-09-13 17:33:46 Okay, real soap or, like, the crap in the pump bottle? Cause I wash mine with homemade soap and condition it with an oil blend that’s mostly olive and avocado.
3250 2018-09-13 17:33:42 So rolled with the organic coconut/hemp oil. It has loads of vitamin e in it too. Thanks for the suggestions

3252 2018-09-13 17:33:28 @HoustonMatters More Ted Cruz lies. 1. Many of those in oil & gas favor a carbon tax  2. The reason premiums have skyrocketed under the ACA is because Republicans have sabotaged the system & caused premiums to go up.
3253 2018-09-13 17:33:26 For sure! Voting RED is so important to keeping the momentum going. 

Jobs coming back, leading in the production of crude oil , tax cuts , decreased regulations, NK returns the remains of our soldiers and so much more!

Keep it going. Vote RED!

He is a snake oil salesman who is rich because he pushes an ideology of unfettered capitalism, which has never worked.
3256 2018-09-13 17:33:11 With the onset of EV's it was pretty obvious the Saudi's were going to disrupt the oil industry to drive prices higher for the last high oil demand era

3261 2018-09-13 17:32:31 I googled too! It’s interesting because like rapeseed oil is already a thing, it seems like canola vs rapeseed oil doesn’t have a super clear distinction between the two
3262 2018-09-13 17:32:29 Already did everything I said I was gonna do today except take my car to get an oil change ... I know it’s still early but that prob won't get done until tomorrow

3264 2018-09-13 17:32:05 9 million US jobs depend on the 2.2 billion $ per day trade with Canada. Canada is the biggest oil supplier to US. 45 wants to throw away 9 million jobs? Give away Canadian oil & gas so prices soar? He has NO idea what trade is about & how that trade helps both countries!!!

@APCNigeria should share their own money not our FG money. @OfficialPDPNig never shared oil and rice as FG!

Make sure ur mum collects her own 27.50 USD.
3272 2018-09-13 17:31:10 Yes they do,its too much power for any one company.  Same as standard oil being broken up
3273 2018-09-13 17:30:54 Why, people ask, would fossil fuel companies, knowing that fossil fuel reserves will eventually run out, not have simply developed renewable energy themselves? Because scarcity drives profits. If they let the oil run down while also fighting green, they make so much more bank
3274 2018-09-13 17:30:51 what about our power supplies ? We have nuclear electric from France and there are also oil pipelines which cross the channel. Believe there is one at Felixstowe?

3283 2018-09-13 17:30:00 It just sucks because our city literally gave up on everything and just made the oil field a priority because nobody wants to get an education anymore.

3285 2018-09-13 17:29:54 For ‘listen to fans’ also read ‘completely ignore fans but manipulate little kids/Saudi oil barons into spending a shit ton of money on our mostly garbage product’
3286 2018-09-13 17:29:33 STEO also forecasting heating oil prices in 2018 at $2.99 a gallon U.S, while 2019 shows $3.12 a gallon. Broken down to Canadian values, that's 4.5 cents a litre more based on today's dollar.
3287 2018-09-13 17:29:21 Probably the most difficult factor is the initial knowledge about EV (Specifically how awesome Teslas' are!).  We did not have a choice but fossil fuels & that has been carved into many mindsets by oil companies.

3289 2018-09-13 17:29:07 Further subsidizing the already heavily subsidized bio-fuel industry, via farmers is a mistake. So is bio-fuel. It's cost to product sale is actually a monetary/oil loss..

3292 2018-09-13 17:28:40 As you know, a lead in time of say 10-12 years might be required for Ont./Quebec to shift away from US oil and gas, requires building the energy east pipeline, then stopping US imports. Maybe acceptable if amount shut out balanced amount added.
3293 2018-09-13 17:28:26 $NIO made 30% on my account after selling all oil stocks for this tech company. Been a good day
3294 2018-09-13 17:28:18 What is wrong with our African leaders? As Africans we are busy stealing from our own economy (corruption) while outside countries are starting a new kind of colonisation which leaders seem not to care about.

We have countries with oil and gas but we're busy importing.
3295 2018-09-13 17:28:14 Agreed lmao. Like I made better looking oil myself when I was 15

3298 2018-09-13 17:27:33 Oil change , air in my tires shower then I’m out.
3299 2018-09-13 17:27:25 In the same way that the BP oil spill was not Obama's. But he got blamed for it a lot all the same.  It's a thing that happens with Presidents. 

Trump keeps making it worse for himself though, every time he speaks on it.
3300 2018-09-13 17:27:20 Yes we definitely should outlaw oil and gas. Everyone could ride horses and bicycles. Great new industry
3301 2018-09-13 17:27:17 : commander of the Tripoli rebel battalion threatens the administration of the oil corporation to impose a deal on behalf of Canadian @NOC_Libya #218NEWS Company
3302 2018-09-13 17:27:16 My face oil has finished and I want to try something new but I’m stuck on what face moisturiser to use. Before my enemies plague me again with acne 
3303 2018-09-13 17:27:04 Somebody send me a litre of coconut oil please.
3304 2018-09-13 17:27:03 My friend just sent me $30 so I can buy my lavender oil! So sweet! 
3305 2018-09-13 17:27:01 tea tree oil for my cuticles, thank you.
3306 2018-09-13 17:26:48 what will you gain when it is only museveni's family gaining from the oil? or may be u r part of the family
3307 2018-09-13 17:26:47 This is a long shot but CBD oil  it worked for me last week, I had the same issue.
3308 2018-09-13 17:26:43 And I can cite literal slave markets in Libya, 40+ million Americans living in 3rd world poverty, a completely destabilized ME w/ a side of global refugee crisis, oil line spills & fracking water contamination, For-Profit Prisons...

None of which tells me what you have given...
3309 2018-09-13 17:26:42 what’s the essential oil for fixing getting essential oil in your eye
3310 2018-09-13 17:26:38 First we're supposedly sanctioning Russian oil and now we should work with them? Am I misconstruing something?
3311 2018-09-13 17:26:32 Ya know I cook A LOT and I know a lot about it but I’m not sure I actually know what canola oil comes from?
3312 2018-09-13 17:26:32 Ung light yun talaga ang kailangan ko Since wala akong bedside table at desk lamp kasi di ko solo ng kwarto. At student pa ako. Kaya kailangan magburn ng midnight oil at times. Masakit kasi sa mata minsan pag ilaw ng phone lang. Sana mapili ako pero OK lang if hindi. Hehe
3313 2018-09-13 17:26:15 Accidentally dumped an entire bottle of tea tree oil into my dehumidifier and now my eyes can smell Christmas.
3314 2018-09-13 17:26:08 Transporting spent fission fuel is not new. Transporting oil is not new. We have been doing both for decades.

There have been lots of oil spills in transport. No spent fuel rod accidents though.
3315 2018-09-13 17:25:51 Oil floats on water and if tank gets low when new fuel delivered, creates an emulsion and next few customers get rubbish.
3316 2018-09-13 17:25:49 Have you tried not being an oil company's Twitter account?

3318 2018-09-13 17:25:36 Origins A Perfect World Age Defense moisturizer. Oil free, really sinks in and doesn't just sit on my skin, and I like the SPF level.
3319 2018-09-13 17:25:24 I hope for all of us that I'm wrong. That you will make a lot of money with your shares and that we'll all be driving electric cars to stick it up to big oil. I'm all in for all of that. But I'm seriously worried ever since the cave thing (he has to focus).
3320 2018-09-13 17:25:23 These girls on this “dab & slay” group really think the oil that looks like reclaim is  and that makes me laugh 
3321 2018-09-13 17:25:23 I thought the only thing holding him together was sun tan oil and burnt skin cells.
3322 2018-09-13 17:25:22 London is a wonderful place however,  its benefitted disproportionately , by dint of it housing the three pillars of power ,the Commons, Lords and the Civil Service it doesn't  for example have 81% of UK oil within its boundaries,  as Scotland does but which is still a hinterland
3323 2018-09-13 17:25:05 So the product listed as 250 mg hemp oil you linked to isn’t necessarily 250mg CBD?  I’m just trying to learn about these products so I purchase the correct stuff. Your store has cbd oil, not hemp oil extract?
3324 2018-09-13 17:25:02 Chopped tomatoes w/ olive oil and basil 
3325 2018-09-13 17:24:42 If it ain't broke don't fix it but know the squeaky wheel gets the oil ...
3326 2018-09-13 17:24:39 Check out since over 2years now d president promised Ogoni cleanup he has not do anything,people are dieing days in days out and worst is that our only means of surviving is getting to worser condition by oil spillage..
3327 2018-09-13 17:24:31 The safety track record for transporting spent fuel is considerably better than the track record for pipelines, tankers, and oil trains.

If you’re going to compare them, look at the actual number and impact of accidents over decades.
3328 2018-09-13 17:24:26 Appreciate your oil updates!
3329 2018-09-13 17:24:24 The dairy farmers in Quebec have more power than our oil industry.
3330 2018-09-13 17:24:16 US Becomes World's Top Oil Producer
 
The United States this year became the largest crude oil producer, surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia, according to preliminary estimates from the Energy Information Administration.
3331 2018-09-13 17:24:15 Leave it to the Oil to screw up another season, waiting away McDavids talents on another shit team. Chiarelli needs to go.

3334 2018-09-13 17:24:06 Ginny, 
Question on net spending always, do ppl today have too much or too little buying power?
Think of it like add oil to your car.
Math equat of more money = inflation refers to static fixed econ model that cannot expand - like USSR.
We have dynamic capitalism. Bsns expands.

3337 2018-09-13 17:23:30 For chicken kebabs - yogurt, lemon juice, oil, a pinch of garam masala, a pinch of chili powder, tandoori seasoning.

3339 2018-09-13 17:22:53 I  squeeze lemon and put a bit of olive oil on anything  these two just go well together..
3340 2018-09-13 17:22:46 @PMOIndia why pmo never speaks about the crude oil price hike..slowly nd steadily it increased upto ₹10 since last 8..10 months..no one is noticing nd asking...people are getting adjusted day by day for ₹1 or ₹2 hike...
3341 2018-09-13 17:22:45 I wonder if the gisou hair oil is good for Afro Caribbean hair? #gisouhairoil
3342 2018-09-13 17:22:45 A legitimate one. One country has the largest amount of oil exported and one has the largest oil reserves within their borders. So I was clarifying
3343 2018-09-13 17:22:36 You can tell how much fuel is going up - the car is invaded by the fumes of diesels that are clearly running on cooking oil pretty much every day.
3344 2018-09-13 17:22:29 Peter rides into the season without upgrading the backend. He will award have that job with the Oil Kings to fall back on

3346 2018-09-13 17:22:08 It looks pretty simple. You can buy pizza dough ready made if you want. Wrap it up, salt, pepper over the spuds and olive oil drizzled.

3366 2018-09-13 17:18:47 Yesterday I talked about being overdue for an oil change on IG. Today I asked “when was the last time you slowed down?” Talking about mindfulness on my story, and someone replied and said “when was the last time you got an oil change?”  #attacked

3371 2018-09-13 17:18:09 You're so correct. My former Senator,  Mary Landrieu pulled this same type of stunt during the Obamacare debates. She claimed blue dog status and held out her Obamacare vote for some oil kickback $ for Louisiana. Her ass was still voted out in the next election.
3372 2018-09-13 17:18:09 The whole house just nearly went up in flames because I left hot oil on the stove.

3380 2018-09-13 17:16:50 idk why i put lavender oil all over my body after a nice warm shower.. i feel so relaxed 
3381 2018-09-13 17:16:49 At #GlobalClimateActionSummit affiliate event on oil production with #HumphreyFellows from @ucdavis. We need to keep 2/3 of known fossil fuels in the ground to avoid catastrophe.
3382 2018-09-13 17:16:44 . As I have said before, oil companies have already gotten their part of the "deal" by receiving the spate of small refiner waivers. Farmers and ethanol producers haven't received anything. That's not a deal.
3383 2018-09-13 17:16:38 You are a snake oil salesman @JerryFalwellJr, no different than Pat Robertson and all those other televangelists! You need to start paying full taxes like the rest of us instead of hiding behind religion to avoid paying your share!

3387 2018-09-13 17:16:12 Estoy de acuerdo con tu propuesta. Yo vote por @lopezobrador_ para que se diera marcha atrás a la reforma energética. Salinas y su empresa Sierra Oil "descubrió" el yacimiento más extenso de los últimos tiempos.

3394 2018-09-13 17:15:10 And Republicans looooove to criticize all the progressives by pointing to what happened in Venezuela. Venezuela did that exactly same shit after the price of oil cratered, which is why it’s in such bad shape now.

3440 2018-09-13 17:11:02 ... free market, Citizens United, free speech. Everyone is all well and good for these things when it serves their own political interest. When they're not however everybody loses their mind. Conservatives have Pharmaceuticals, business & oil. Liberals have tech and humanities.
3441 2018-09-13 17:11:01 This coconut oil really getting the dark spots out my face
3442 2018-09-13 17:11:00 The transition to a different fuel source will happen but not soon, maybe in a 100 years. In the mean time let's not make the situation worse for the environment by shipping oil by rail.
3443 2018-09-13 17:10:50 The petrol prices have been high throughout this government’s rule, even though the crude oil prices were low, globally. Also, are you sure that though globally the prices for Petrol is still low, the current government isn’t trying to compensate for extravagant spendings?
3444 2018-09-13 17:10:49 We have cinnamon roles here. But fried bread takes an expert cook. Otherwise its just hot oil soaked bread
3445 2018-09-13 17:10:44 Liberating? Syria has a president, and US wants to Liberate OIL
3446 2018-09-13 17:10:41 I put beard oil in my beard today. might just be the manliest thing I have ever done 
3447 2018-09-13 17:10:40 Property taxes can be pretty unattractive.  Texas alone produces more oil, 5.3 million bpd, than all countries except Saudi Arabia and Russia. Where does all that revenue from royalties and taxes go?!!  Why are property taxes going up so fast in this 3 yr long boom?
3448 2018-09-13 17:10:21 …ぐぅ

3450 2018-09-13 17:09:50 They had one fuel oil plant and two diesel ones - not sure of operating conditions or setup, though.
3451 2018-09-13 17:09:44 Plus industries will ebb and flow ( like oil ) so there will be times that these areas contribute more and times hey contribute less. The impact of this is reduced by pooling and sharing across all 4 home nations and their varied contributions
3452 2018-09-13 17:09:17 Be careful of the oil slicks on the road.. !!
3453 2018-09-13 17:09:12 Okay so let me tell you a kinda tragic story
All of my nails broke, most of them are layering off 
But this weekend I’m Getting Jojoba oil with Maia so

3455 2018-09-13 17:08:54 The tin man who needs oil is @heygurll02 who needs cold brew because cold brew tastes like fkn oil
3456 2018-09-13 17:08:53 Really,  tell me about it after you've done some research.  How did one of the richest oil countries become a third world country with thousands fleeing and those who speak out are thrown in jail ?
3457 2018-09-13 17:08:50 Mine weirdly use the Oil of Olay Microdermabrasion kit twice a week and helps alot.  It is a 180 difference for Logan when he uses it.

3464 2018-09-13 17:08:12 Killing innocent black and brown people in foreign countries for oil is cool as long as they’re reported. The Dems should run on that so they can lose another 1000+ seats. That ought to do it.
3465 2018-09-13 17:08:11 It’s debilitating isnt it, feel so unbalanced! Can’t hear a thing mun, cheers Tom tried the otex gonna have to have a go at the olive oil wish me luck
3466 2018-09-13 17:08:09 Takes an old Etonian, former oil exec, Archbishop for them to find their voice...
3467 2018-09-13 17:08:01 #DearAmerica, you are now a country that rips babies away from their parents, builds internment camps, allows your fellows citizens to die from neglect, rips up national heritage sites for oil, is working to ruin
3468 2018-09-13 17:07:55 Tonight, @OilCapsHockey vs. Dauphin Kings at the Tundra in Virden...GO OIL CAPS GO!!!!!!!
3469 2018-09-13 17:07:36 However, if you have a local Auto body shop with a spray booth, it might be worth flipping a little jing to someone to have it done by someone with some practice on the spray nozzle. Plus they probably also have a decent clear coat, should you decide to go poly instead of oil.
3470 2018-09-13 17:07:30 Fucking oil on this car expensive as fuck
3471 2018-09-13 17:07:06 Coal mining jobs Obama and Clinton said jobs are not coming back. The US being the number one oil producer in the world!!!! Obama didn't do any of that!!!

3474 2018-09-13 17:06:52 I feel your pain.  I made my dogs potatoes, eggs & cheese with butter and salt for breakfast with some hemp oil for balanced fatty acids on the side.  Yet, I did not have time for breakfast myself.  Sad.
3475 2018-09-13 17:06:49 Please hurry. Let EU deal with there pipeline.  British and French are Causing GENOCIDE in Hebrew Biafra and Southern Cameroon for oil and gas.
3476 2018-09-13 17:06:45 I would like to thank President Trump for opening up the doors to the oil industry andmake us first in producing and exporting, and now we need him to drop oil prices a dollar a gallon as we need to care for our citizens first and then the world, 
3477 2018-09-13 17:06:42 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match
3478 2018-09-13 17:06:36 speaking gallbladder & coconut oil. 1) mct’s don’t need bile to pass through digestive tract. 2) mct’s do not need chylomicron to transport via lymphatic system. 3) MCT’s don’t need carnitine to transport through the mitochondria. this results in a great fast clean energy source.
3479 2018-09-13 17:06:07 No, but he's very popular with those who made $$multi millions from #war, prisons,  oil bidness the eight years he was in office
3480 2018-09-13 17:05:57 $WRG.CA So this is a turnaround story, anticipating an upturn in oil and gas drilling. Looks like an attractive takeover
3481 2018-09-13 17:05:50 Finally oil minister dharmendra pradhan wakes up to increase oil production. Need to depend less on imports. Drain on forex reserves.
3482 2018-09-13 17:05:49 Making me choose between oil field and army 
3483 2018-09-13 17:05:44 How to you go from being out of oil to be the largest oil nation?

3488 2018-09-13 17:05:14 It's not a perfect system but at least it avoids giving power to nutjobs and fools with extremist views. Do you really want a system where Libertians, Christian Heritage, and Marxist-Leninists are courted to form a coalition?
3489 2018-09-13 17:05:08 Can't... Shopping for peroxide, oil drums, lye, and an alibi.

3494 2018-09-13 17:04:44 I don't think anyone is disputing that its the visceral fat - just that the way to get rid of the visceral fat is to reduce the  deadly carb's/ seed oil combo - which if overweight will be accompanied by other weight loss, but starving already slim people makes no sense at all.
3495 2018-09-13 17:04:35 I feel mature when I go get my oil changed without calling my dad
3496 2018-09-13 17:04:19 I got some itch oil now

3505 2018-09-13 17:03:07 To aid Israel’s regional expansionist aspirations and consolidate Israel’s illegal occupation of Syria’s Golan Heights and theft of Golan oil? Or does it just look like that?

3507 2018-09-13 17:02:54 I couldn't stop thinking about a certain oil company owned resort that started hiring eastern Europeans using J1 visas. It is like they were sponsoring Butina & Chapman like agents for years placing them near the rich media elite that would congregate there every July....

3509 2018-09-13 17:02:37 Every time I've heard a party trumpet a budget surplus just in time for an election it's involved lying that's uncovered by the next government. Except Harper, who just stopped paying bills, narrowed the viewing period monthly, and sold assets like a junkie with a yard sale.
3510 2018-09-13 17:02:33 All education at any age and the person's who teach is a lot more important than being an over paid Carnival Barker selling snake oil to the masses.
3511 2018-09-13 17:02:20 Did you know that 54 percent of home energy costs are related to heating or cooling equipment? HVAC gas heating and cooling devices are more economical and provide a cleaner source of energy than oil or coal.
3512 2018-09-13 17:02:17 When I hear Cruz/GOP talk about how they're winning voters in TX.. I look at my "red" work environment (south TX oil/gas industry) and I see more and more #BetoForSenate stickers on workers trucks. 

This is a "red" workforce.. it "was" at least.

@tedcruz is screwed.
3513 2018-09-13 17:02:12 Nope. The Lucas Oil twitter page said we can’t
3514 2018-09-13 17:02:03 Sorry Chris, mea culpa...shouldn’t have put a great old profession in the same sentence with a snake oil salesman. Come to think if it, I’m now doing the same to snake oil 
3515 2018-09-13 17:01:59 So I'm in a coffee shop and Midnight Oil's "Blue Sky Mine" starts playing, and within 20 seconds some part of my fool brain decides to cry. Real tears! No idea why.

Now there's a Turing test. When an A.I. does that, call me.

3523 2018-09-13 17:01:27 tbh iraq was a shit show and while US forces took the city, they did nothing to protect the city’s infrastructure from the mass looting that happened in wake of the takeover. only protected ministry of oil. so iraq is more proof of US incompetency, that continues 2 this day w/ PR
3524 2018-09-13 17:01:22 Olive oil
3525 2018-09-13 17:01:21 Not if it’s hemp derived and lacking THC - you are just selling snake oil -
3526 2018-09-13 17:01:18 Oil supplies however are high.  So we will have to watch and wait on gas prices...

3546 2018-09-13 17:00:03 Isn't he the one who manipulates the gold and silver markets????? maybe oil as well????
3547 2018-09-13 17:00:02 It is in the national security interests of the US that our oil production be directed 1st to fill the needs of the domestic market, stabilize the price at the pump & eliminate supply disruptions. If you put the American people 1st U will do all in your power to see this happen.
3548 2018-09-13 17:00:02 This just need to start performing imo. No more excuses now, your raised the money (millions) and found oil. Time to look after the people you’ve used to raise your money #UKOG
3549 2018-09-13 17:00:01 Someone who is already misogynistic and tribalistic would see nothing wrong with the tweet.. so I am not surprised that a lot of pple don’t perceive what is oozing from it.
3550 2018-09-13 16:59:38 Bottom line is the economy is growing and gaining strength despite your efforts to sabotage it. The economy grew in the last few years of the Obama administration in spite of Obama, not because of him. Thanks to oil and gas, i.e. fracking!
3551 2018-09-13 16:59:38 Gas was cheap because OPEC flooded the market with crude oil.  This caused a setback in producing domestic crude, keeping the US dependent on OPEC. This was done  after the US was released to start exporting crude.  Almost like it was planned.
3552 2018-09-13 16:59:30 Not true, it repairs itself continuously.  We once thought when a oil well was once pumped dry it should be sealed because it was of no use. So here is education for you. We unsealed one in the ocean and it's full of oil again and is pumping again. We were not gone yet it healed

3556 2018-09-13 16:59:26 insulin stimulates de novo lipogenesis in the liver and excessive cholesterol is byproduct of that. I don’t care about those pro-moderate carb naysayers who say coconut oil is toxic. let them have gallstones, fatty liver disease, insulin resistance and all the metabolic syndrome.

3560 2018-09-13 16:58:39 Total has submitted a revised offer, following talks with the Unite Union and the conciliation service ACAS. It follows a long-running dispute between the oil company and workers on the Elgin, Alwyn and Dunbar installations. Unite members will be balloted on the new offer.
3561 2018-09-13 16:58:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
3562 2018-09-13 16:58:33 Actually when he was alive he was building hospitals schools roads.  That is where the oil money went to.
3563 2018-09-13 16:58:23 The fact I’ve had an hour coconut oil massage, a foot scrub, a pedicure and a manicure today and it only cost me £25 all together is OUTRAGEOUS
3564 2018-09-13 16:58:08 Fish Oil helps too..
3565 2018-09-13 16:58:04 The Alberta Energy Regulator grew massively with the oil & gas boom in the early 2000s. Have there been any cuts at all since drilling activity dropped to almost nothing?
3566 2018-09-13 16:58:00 It’s a good feeling have a newer car because when I got my oil change they literally only recommended the oil change instead of trying to screw me out of money  #winning

3571 2018-09-13 16:57:41 planned by the government so they could invade iraq for oil, plus george bush owned a weapons company at the time so he profited from the iraq war
3572 2018-09-13 16:57:38 Oh Trudeau will ride to the rescue with a few billion to tide them over for a couple additional months on EI. Just like when oil tanked in Alberta. Have they done anything since to solve the underlying problem? Nope. So will go the fortunes of the newly extinct Ontario autoworker

1.Northerners believe that decorum should only be observed by women.

3597 2018-09-13 16:55:17 Our gasoline prices are caused by several factors: OPEC production of oil, supply vs demand (demand is always higher during summer) refinery output (down for maintenance/repair), Middle East stability, barrels of crude in storage, stock market, etc.

3. In coming yrs, USD's will be made infinite, phys oil won't be.

3707 2018-09-13 16:45:20 Yes, it would destroy it! They would all just quit the current wells and leave them to rust. Can’t we just think of the struggling oil & ng industries for once? They’re barely profitable and need our help. #copolitics

3723 2018-09-13 16:44:17 India is facing rising fuel prices.  The Government is working to find a solution including reducing excise duties, bringing the fuels under the Goods and Service Tax, issuing oil bonds or forcing public oil companies to absorb the increase in prices.
3724 2018-09-13 16:44:09 Don't know where you can get Australian Snake Oil but what you really need is some chlorpromazine.
3725 2018-09-13 16:44:04 Gas prices never drop......

Oil companies take their tax breaks, their "deregulation" they destroy our country and then we don't even reap lower prices. 

Something is wrong with the GOP
3726 2018-09-13 16:43:56 it smelled so much like coconut oil mmm
3727 2018-09-13 16:43:53 Hmm.....does it taste like coconut? That would be a plus. Silicone based lube is my go-to, but maybe I should branch out into some good, healthy nut oil. As it were.

3735 2018-09-13 16:43:15 Isn't it obvious? Burning fossil fuels, spilling oil, expelling other pollution into the atmosphere, polluting the water, etc. All things Republicans support in their mad quest for deregulation, while ignoring all externalities. The GOP doesn't care about this planet.

3741 2018-09-13 16:42:41 What I mean is how would I know when to use hemp oil or CBD or CBD with THC? There's just so many different choices you can make and most of us are not educated. On October 17th the shuttles will be full of CBD and hemp. How will the public know what to buy?
3742 2018-09-13 16:42:37 That's the point it's not. Fishing industry bigger than Ingerlund, oil taken more than Norway yet Norway has a 1trillion sovereign fund Scotland doesn't.. Guess why Ingerlund. GERS stats proven as fraud. Ingerlund propped up by Scotland.

3744 2018-09-13 16:42:24 Trudeau promised #Canadians this pipeline would be built, but has done nothing to follow through on his promise.

Worse still, this fiasco is now threatening other expansions in the oil and gas sector, putting even more jobs at risk.
3745 2018-09-13 16:42:23 (Butter, collagen, cinnamon, coconut oil, chocolate, vanilla essence...okay maybe I can only guess 6. I feel slightly better.)
3746 2018-09-13 16:42:10 Elevating the fuel prices without any justification when the crude oil price is comparatively low. Price of fuel maintained high by imposing high tax rate is a classic example of burdening the general public. LPG price crossed over the ₹800 mark, it's double the price of 2014.

3821 2018-09-13 16:33:43 Want to talk fiscal responsibility?  Why depend on oil for revenues for years without putting $$$ away for when the cyclical industry downturns?  Why not implement a small sales tax to diversify revenue streams?

3839 2018-09-13 16:31:15 Lmao I dead ass bought 2 bottles of her oil, that shit is witchcraft. Been using it for only 5 days.. it turned 4C into 4A. Shit is unheard of 
3840 2018-09-13 16:31:14 Right since Rafeal Cruz had sooo much to do with increased oil output. And why are we paying more for gas if we supply the oil ?
3841 2018-09-13 16:31:12 Thanks ManicMark but what Trump supporters want to believe means nothing to me. They are either bots or really naive people who choose to believe whatever a snake oil salesman wants them to hear and believe...

3851 2018-09-13 16:30:18 yep, painting with oil feels like letting your soul wander OOF
3852 2018-09-13 16:30:18 @liberal_party If you truly had our back you would have ensured that Alberta could get oil to market. You would also force @JustinTrudeau to step down immediately because he seems more concerned with the citizens of countries other than Canada.
3853 2018-09-13 16:30:16 Oil?
3854 2018-09-13 16:30:14 One of the weird things about psoriasis is, for milder flare-ups at least, the most effective treatments are coal tar-based ointments. So many mornings, after getting ready for the day, I walk out of the bathroom smelling vaguely like I just changed the oil in my car.
3855 2018-09-13 16:30:10 The sad part in this whole mess is: 1.We all know pipelines leak inevitably 2.We all know it's the best way to transport oil 3.There are ways forward 4. There are oodles of rules on this topic 5. ALL governments seem to think they don't apply to them ..... the real problem here?

3858 2018-09-13 16:29:47 ..and smear themselves in some oil as a reward..
3859 2018-09-13 16:29:46 Imports must be banned on a huge number of products I agree... mere counselling ppl will not do enough. However, major % is oil / machines / construction material and equipment. As a nation, there must be guidelines set for by Govt to limit the use of above.
3860 2018-09-13 16:29:44 I agree with ramping down coal and Oil ASAP. Introduce incentives to boost renewables, and we will have all the energy we need without toxic nuclear waste, and facilities that take decades to build or decommission
3861 2018-09-13 16:29:36 Exactly ! Creating high tension rift between the Asian countries and drifting away the spirit of #globalTrade #MiddleEast #IRAN Sanctions is absolutely a matter of concern and needs a solution to this. #IndiaIran oil  relations !

3866 2018-09-13 16:29:05 All I’m seeing is baby oil & bad photoshop I can’t confirm or deny your implications 
3867 2018-09-13 16:28:52 Thus why Putin is so hellbent to cause chaos and divide in America. Russia cannot survive with oil prices being down and not the primary producer.
As I understood it a while ago, correct me if Im wrong, but they needed prices around $120/bbl
3868 2018-09-13 16:28:43 While America is focused on the Atlantic Ocean and Hurricane Florence Ryan Zinke is selling off millions of acres of federal lands to oil companies  helping corrupt fellow  Republicans line their pockets.

3874 2018-09-13 16:28:20 Extra oil sef 
3875 2018-09-13 16:28:20 I wonder what will happen  if we open up this coastline to oil drilling and another hurricane hits?
3876 2018-09-13 16:28:18 And that’s not a good thing, Ted. The oil economy will end in the next 50 years so what is the plan?
3877 2018-09-13 16:28:17 Please, who is using Beard Oil here?
3878 2018-09-13 16:28:17 It’s hard to calculate oil subsidies because global warming cost predictions are probabilistic. It’s not like costing a nuclear waste cleanup.

It’s easier to think about the TAM for clean energy (inevitable) and our relative progress there.

Obviously very related though.
3879 2018-09-13 16:28:10 You can deep fry in tallow and coconut oil and olive oil but olive oil is expensive to deep fry in!! I pan fry everything in olive oil or coconut oil and deep fry in tallow.
3880 2018-09-13 16:28:08 Ahhh great, my wife and I rub the peppermint oil for tummy aches, but had no idea about the hangovers . Will have to try it next time :) thank so much!
3881 2018-09-13 16:28:05 Did a tank exchange at just about any store to get rid oil f the old tank and get a new one.
3882 2018-09-13 16:28:03 300 billion barrels of oil reserves in Venezuela. Absolute bargain.
3883 2018-09-13 16:27:48 Is it just me? Has anyone notice the spike in gas prices? Hurricane Florence is at least 1600 mile from Chicago. On the way to Doctor it was $2.78. One the way back the same station $3.05 AG Sessions! Investigate the oil companies for price gouging!
3884 2018-09-13 16:27:39 Omg how sad, I used to smoke in that bathroom when I had 8 am art classes in fact the oil painting you wanted (but never got cause my teacher took it) was the view from that bathroom xD

3914 2018-09-13 16:24:48 The attacks on Alberta's economy will keep coming.
The gains we made during the Harper era are long gone and this time the Liberals are determined to kill it for good. Our own Premier reluctantly displays support for the Oil Industry.
3915 2018-09-13 16:24:45 How can it be right. what about price of oil we import and the retail price at 71 rupees the oil was around 107 usd per barrel
3916 2018-09-13 16:24:38 53% of the United States economy goes to 1% of its population. Only 54% of U.S. population voted in last election. Methane 20x more dangerous than oil, and this Administration is removing the safeguards that protect us. - Senator  John Kerry.
3917 2018-09-13 16:24:35 Shekhar, @ThePrintIndia did a good job transcribing the BJP's botched graphs into more legible ones, but the key factor is the reference Global Oil Price at each point, without which it's meaningless.

3923 2018-09-13 16:24:17 Sometimes I feel I’m tweeting lobs, just asking for you to dunk on me ;). I enjoy it.

Ive heard a lot about oil subsidies but nothing about their magnitude. How much are we talking? Aren’t solar panels and electric cars massively subsidized? How do these compare?

3967 2018-09-13 16:19:32 Back in the old days of the West there was a term they used that applies today.....A Snake Oil Salesman is someone who knowingly sells fraudulent goods or who is himself or herself a fraud, quack, charlatan, and the like.
3968 2018-09-13 16:19:24 This is bullshit and you know it.
It was the re-born christian "Bushi" and his neo-conversative clique. They attacked Afghanistan and not Saudi-Arabia, even though most of 9/11 suiciders were Saudis.
Saudi-Arabia was spared from America's revenge, due to
CHEAP OIL.

Government need to examine stop this 4 good of party/people. congress gang is misleading the country. Your urgent attention requested.
3991 2018-09-13 16:17:23 As a Canadian, I would be a much deeper admirer if our Saudi friends can push oil prices to about $100 for a few years, WTI that is.

Do pocan prefer anal ease or baby oil for rear entrance?
3999 2018-09-13 16:16:45 Yes they do, but it becomes information overload. My example would be for oil and invasion Bush 41 could have marched right into Baghdad, taken the fields to an already weakened Iraq. One reason, I think the push for big Haliburton $$ was Cheney, Rumsfeld.

4018 2018-09-13 16:15:04 Besides making herb smell the way it does, terpenes, a hydrocarbon that is found in the essential oil of plants, also have mild physical effects and are also partially responsible for the different subjective effects induced by different strains of cannabis.

PTB planning war against .  planning 2 mine Straits of Hormuz in retaliation, blow up oil tankers, like they did (only once I think) during  war, which caused oil spike.

Pretty sure PTB aware of this consequence.

Consider possibility it's intentional.

4045 2018-09-13 16:12:26 A vegan diet takes care of most of what we need to do. But you'll also want to minimize the use of oils generally, because while olive oil and other vegetable oils are better for your heart than chicken fat, they are as fattening as animal fats. - Neal Barnard

4066 2018-09-13 16:09:30 That's because dear boy America is the terrorist and Saudi Isreal ISIS Al-Qaeda are its henchmen so why would it press anyone. Iraq was for oil and the greater Isreal project. Afghanistan was about an oil pipeline. If you believe in boggymen you'll find them all in America.
4067 2018-09-13 16:09:26 What false promises is that?  If you want lies and pure fantasy, try reading the white paper.  None of that came true.  Start up costs £200m lol.  Everything man woman and child would be £300K richer.  £8bn a year from oil revenue.  You're lucky you's lost.

4072 2018-09-13 16:08:53 A good piece by J Maloney. It affirms the astonishment felt by many that Canada can’t get its shit together so we all can use and benefit from the profits of Cdn oil production and export. The crazies have taken over!

4075 2018-09-13 16:08:16 What is your definition of spare capacity? Available oil in 30 days for an extended period is near zero. 0.6 Mb/d neutral zone needs capital and 6-9 months. Everything else needs more capital and time, much more
4076 2018-09-13 16:08:12 Always remember to the change the oil in your time machine once every 6 months or 3,000 years.

4080 2018-09-13 16:08:03 Then why don't you campaign for the church to pay bloody tax then? The hypocrisy is breathtaking. You're a snake oil salesman, who will bleed the country dry, and then just piss off to the back benches when you've ruined the country with your big fat pension and expenses
4081 2018-09-13 16:07:58 This is so interesting. Going to have to give it a try. The coconut oil has me a little worried though.

4083 2018-09-13 16:07:54 That's shouldn't be your problem...what you should worry about is what the Central Govt is doing with Oil Money... You should know things will always fall apart if the Center cannot hold right?

4104 2018-09-13 16:05:34 Anyone else’s skin dry as shit during the winter but as soon as summer comes you have so much oil you could deep fry a whole chicken? 
4105 2018-09-13 16:05:33 The Phrase “When you realise you’re in a hole, stop digging” comes to mind.
However Trump knows he’s in a hole but tells everybody the hold is gold lined & there’s oil at the bottom
Truth is - he’s in a shithole.

4108 2018-09-13 16:05:08 It's all about percentages. Is there any reason Europe HAS to use $ to buy oil from other countries?

I recently send money from HK to Malaysia, and it went through US$ and NY. Why would THAT be true 10 years from now? (60 years ago it would've been Pounds Sterling and London).

4110 2018-09-13 16:05:03 Well what a month it has been.  Turkish Lira hitting problems as well as the Argentine Peso. Both countries struggling. Oil can it break 80? It’s trying. I still think we are heading slowly towards $90 by year end. Indices are all over the place. Waiting for stability.
4111 2018-09-13 16:05:01 I still can remember when Obama did nothing about the oil drilling spill mishap at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico.
4112 2018-09-13 16:05:00 Phase out oil and gas? So we'll just eliminate most types of transportation and let the economy take a huge hit? Thats putting it mildly...
4113 2018-09-13 16:05:00 No one even the author of the article is disputing that reform is long overdue the PCs did us no favors and the NDP has continued and exacerbated the problem of gov spending. We spend more than we make if we budget for balance at $30 a barrel oil instead of $60 we get surpluses.
4114 2018-09-13 16:04:52 Why my roommate use my pan I just bought and didn’t want to use yet because you had to prep it a certain way with oil before use to cook her smelly ass vegetarian breakfast without asking...
4115 2018-09-13 16:04:45 So is every oil/gas company, auto company, and many mfg companies.

4127 2018-09-13 16:03:29 Unlike you, I was fully aware of her work as Sec of State.  I already know about her fracking record. She viewed it as a cleaner alternative to coal or oil, as a way to thwart Russia's energy dominance, and she wanted to be sure that there were regulations in place. #sensibility
4128 2018-09-13 16:03:19 I'm like you but I don't wash daily. I just wet it then apply oil.
4129 2018-09-13 16:03:11 We share your concern about expanding into precious forest for palm oil production. Producers who are members of the RSPO follow Principles & Criteria for #sustainable #palmoil production - including no clearing of primary forest or areas of high conservation value @HCVNetwork
4130 2018-09-13 16:03:05 #ToddPage Super food is Wheat Grass in Powder form. go to Vitamin Cottage ask for the powder not the pill. The powder has a electromagnetic reaction to it.

4133 2018-09-13 16:03:03 Today #Houston - a city driven by the oil and gas industry - is announcing its first-ever "climate action plan" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Expecting to hear more later.
4134 2018-09-13 16:02:57 Dulu masa mula2 kerja pernah tertipu beli skincare from bodyshop. Habis nak dekat 700 ringgit time tu. Aku rasa mcm kena bomoh dengan promoter time tu. Muka aku berminyak teruk but yang dia suggest adalah produk yang oil base.
4135 2018-09-13 16:02:53 Where do I gotta sign up to be the “oil guy” for these models... sheeesh 
4136 2018-09-13 16:02:53 1. this was unnecessarily malicious 2. i was getting my oil changed. i was sitting inside the nissan ..
4137 2018-09-13 16:02:52 that time the whole venue sang bonnie tyler with @iAmPsychoMike, and then we found out that what was in the box... was love. (and body oil.)
4138 2018-09-13 16:02:38 Imagine what the numbers would look like if the liberal government was less hostile toward the oil and gas industry. Plus imagine all the taxes that would be in the coffers which could be invested in cleaner initiatives. Transition didn’t have to be this hard. We lead already.
4139 2018-09-13 16:02:10 big fax. I'm doing something called an "oil change" and taking the pup for some "appointment" ?!? like what the fuck is these tings?
4140 2018-09-13 16:01:52 What else can you take shots of and pour it on your driveway to get out oil stains.
4141 2018-09-13 16:01:51 Ok, thanks for pointing that out.

Ok, I've found it & now had a look at it - I'm open to facts 

Interesting.
I take it you're aware of the following:

i) Oil price collapse in 2014-16?
ii) Oil price correlation with investment?
iii) the six quarter smoothing those graphs use?
4142 2018-09-13 16:01:48 Skin clean and heal ho jaata hai laafi. Works as Good beard oil as well

4148 2018-09-13 16:00:52 Americans love soccer tbf. He's American yes but he's an actor, if we asked someone like Ricky Gervais about soccer the interview would turn out similar. "Movie stars and football/soccer like oil and water".

4151 2018-09-13 16:00:35 Who is the world's leading oil producer, recently surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia?  Who 'dat you ask?  America.  Industrial production of many forms coming back to the USA.  It's one of the many reasons the U.S. economy continues to hum.#capacityutilization
4152 2018-09-13 16:00:28 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.

4154 2018-09-13 16:00:27 Why did oil get hit today? Answer: because the State sets prices through HFT, & unlimited money. Since Brent went over $80 bucks 3 times and we had to drag it off the wall we decided that enough was enough, so we sell bombed oil (after we let our banker friends know of our plan).

4158 2018-09-13 16:00:19 Germany needs LNG just like rest of the Europe. US LNG will probably be the cheapest option for Germany. Natural gas can reduce Germany's dependence on oil & coal. Most of the Asian countries are effectively reducing their oil consumption while increasing gas consumption.

4162 2018-09-13 16:00:06 I think favorite and most insightful were the episodes with barrels of oil. Truly informative and explained the pricing process so well 

Least favorite? Demonetization in India. Episode was based on heavily biased sources and no follow up.

4167 2018-09-13 15:59:22 The Kochs pump oil future prices so they may use that money to fund their Nazi candidates. The Kochs own or influence half the US stock market. Backed by Putin's wealth, they continue their attacks on the USA.

4169 2018-09-13 15:59:18 So what two countries benefit the most from sanctions on Iranian oil?  Saudi Arabia and Russia.  No accident.
4170 2018-09-13 15:59:09 The 70s was the barber boom as a result of the ccc act. De-reg lending caused house price inflation and increased consumer spending, then the oil crises hit...it's what ultimately led to a neoliberal thatcher government.
4171 2018-09-13 15:59:08 No matter what the US military bases exists in Saudi at the moment or don't !! the fact is that whenever US OR ISRAEL r determined, they can make Saudi land as a US-Israeli military base !!. Saudi oil is only serving Zionist policies of domination.
Indisent Shamefuly Dependence.
4172 2018-09-13 15:59:06 im also over on my oil change!! amazing
4173 2018-09-13 15:59:02 Lmao this is why it’s pointless having discourse with Trump supporters. She misreads the original post, the mistake is pointed out and explained, and she completely ignores the inaccuracy and calls Obama a snake oil salesman instead. Purposefully ignorant.
4174 2018-09-13 15:58:51 The horses are on our public lands & are not hurting anyone.  BLM claims they are over-populated, even though their numbers are insignificant compared to cattle grazed on the land for next to nothing.  End goal is clear land to let oil & mining robber barons take it over.
4175 2018-09-13 15:58:33 you could massage the kale with some olive oil first to soften it

4186 2018-09-13 15:57:00 Oil is traded in US$, and our currency is consistently performing poorly against the Dollar because it’s an “emerging market” currency. Also, geo-political issues affect the oil price. So our politics/politicians mainly affect our currency, but not by a lot

4195 2018-09-13 15:55:50 Confronting the US, challenging Italy on some Cyprus oil development, (based on ludicrous arguments), alienating Iran on Syria... sometimes I get the feeling Turkey is biting more than it can chew.

I'm sure it has nothing to do with the clout oil co's have.

4201 2018-09-13 15:55:20 Al oil lo miro desde los fundamentos. Esta en backwardation desde 2017 con produccion shale y opec balanceada desde el recorte. Esto lleva a estabilidad de precios mas alla de los upside o recortes q tenga. De corto ojo con el agache y el trma huracanes.

4244 2018-09-13 15:49:11 The biggest of all defaulters are Govt PSU's...... Vijay Mallya incurred losses through Kingfisher Airlines that too in 3/4 years, when oil prices were at peak... Whereas Indian Airlineses are about to post $1.9 billion in single year. Now whom shall we blame 
4245 2018-09-13 15:49:09 Oil down 1.56, $XEG green. Upside down Canada.

4248 2018-09-13 15:48:54 Delusion is that solar is impractical. We cud have had universal rooftop solar for Less than cost of Iraq war. Endless wars in ME on public $ to defend oil & paying 100s of Bil$ p/y to Saudis that fund extremism are externalities that make FF impractical Even If There Were No GHE
4249 2018-09-13 15:48:50 Yeah, roasted cauliflower might work. I steamed the broccoli and mixed lemon juice and olive oil to coat it. Then at the last second I impulsively added chipotle. #NeverAgain
4250 2018-09-13 15:48:44 a clean room, some fresh sheets, a warm bath, coconut oil, and some scented candles
4251 2018-09-13 15:48:27 Yes, it's really very bad and sad.
I believe, probably it wasn't meant that we should find and then pick up (the ancient) oil from the earth's interior.
4252 2018-09-13 15:48:21 If u can clean oil with it it prolly shouldn't be in ur body. Also contributes to global warming prolly with all the gas the carbonation gives ppl
4253 2018-09-13 15:48:18 today's good decisions:
1) buying hot mango chutney
2) eating flatbread that was lightly toasted with olive oil alongside hot mango chutney and cherry jam and feta cheese

4259 2018-09-13 15:47:37 worried about the privatisation talk within the @edmnangagwa administration at this hour and most of the SOEs will be sold for a song. Reminds me of the Russian privatisation of its oil which ended up creating oligarchs

4266 2018-09-13 15:46:31 Check your Transmission oil today.
4267 2018-09-13 15:46:29 Funny how you don’t know where the former Secretary of State worked? Oil and gas companies aren’t particular where we get things from as long as they meet spec. We’ll buy flanges from China and trays from India and use on the same job.
4268 2018-09-13 15:46:21 Yep! And I live in oil country where landlords have no problem price gouging apartments without considering what the rest of us who don’t work in the oil fields will do to pay rent.
4269 2018-09-13 15:46:18 @ChrisFixed Hi Chris, really big fan here learned a lot from your vids keep up the good work. Two questions what’s the name of the ramp you use to ramp up your cars(link if possible) and how can you open a oil drain if the drain head is damaged? Thank you very much 
4270 2018-09-13 15:46:16 yess i will, its usually pretty effective i love tea tree oil
4271 2018-09-13 15:46:15 Why do you still use feedstock from Palm oil production?
4272 2018-09-13 15:46:05 You mean all of the oil in California, or the soybeans Texas grows to make tofu?
4273 2018-09-13 15:46:00 My favourite is Organic Harvest Orange Essential Oil because it helps my hair to grow longer. Whenever i use Organic Harvest Orange Essential Oil positive thoughts come to my mind that is relaxed.

4282 2018-09-13 15:45:04 i know that one makes my hair flake, i use the argan oil so i’ll see if that one works.

4285 2018-09-13 15:44:38 A thought now, shouldnt we be looking at *thin* people with type 2 diabetes? Fat/obeist is obvious? (but it does get me that the body reaction is giving it all the fuel to burn). 2nd is burn rate of say actual fat eaten, rendered v unrendered, butter and olive oil.
4286 2018-09-13 15:44:30 Now reheat the leftovers on the skillet with thc olive oil mm Mmmm
4287 2018-09-13 15:44:28 i wanna deep fry one of those giant catfish that's 10 feet long whole in a giant vat of oil and serve it for my next birthday
4288 2018-09-13 15:44:22 Motorcycle maintenance series is part2.(Is series started?)
I changed engine-oil of my working buddy.
He run over 230 thousand km,
So I have to change oil in short span, about twice par month.
We run about 5 thousand km par month.
…And, I'm tired._(:3 」∠)_

4289 2018-09-13 15:44:12 I’ve honestly only ever tried the olive oil one
4290 2018-09-13 15:44:10 This argument drives me nuts. It's every kid who's ever said "Well, so & so is doing it, so why not me?" Oil has been subsidized by govts for decades. If renewable energy had the same subsidies, the world would look quite different. Time to be weaned from the oil teat.
4291 2018-09-13 15:43:28 I'm ordering some MCT oil. Apparently it gives the same effects as you're describing
4292 2018-09-13 15:43:23 WHERE IS 'HERE" in relation to this station? If we are talking the same town, area ... etc .. $.20 is a significant increase, and if it was increased as people are buying gas to evacuate a storm - it's illegal needs to be reported.
4293 2018-09-13 15:43:11 It was for me. It wasn't great for my skin to begin with though. Like it helped but I definitely have dry, super sensitive skin so proactive fucked that right up. My skin hates chemicals but also oil but can't do just water and don't look at it weird.
4294 2018-09-13 15:43:08 lol I can get u some Castrol Oil Nephew! #donthatecongratulate
4295 2018-09-13 15:43:08 Congratulations guys!!!
4296 2018-09-13 15:43:08 There is similarly concentrated clearing house risk from a market discontinuity in oil markets. As with the 1985 Tin Crisis the risk does not lie with private traders but with macro manipulation by states in the battle for global market dominance #PutNotYourTrustinPrinces
4297 2018-09-13 15:42:58 hey guys kailangan ko umuwi ng maaga lalagyan pa ko ng efficascent oil ng lola ko sa likod

4301 2018-09-13 15:42:35 I already made this particular one with an oil base and I love it so I thought to have another attempt with an alcohol base.
4302 2018-09-13 15:42:19 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
4303 2018-09-13 15:42:18 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4304 2018-09-13 15:42:13 “There’s something crazy here” @MikeBloomberg on protesters at the #GlobalClimateActionSummit they say California hasn’t been tough enough on oil Bloomberg says environmentalists protesting an environmental summit is akin to building a wall around a country we want to vacation in
4305 2018-09-13 15:42:08 NOT an airsoft, a traditional CO2 "air gun" firing metal BBs or pellets. Airsoft guns use lower pressure freon/silicone oil propellant and plastic pellets, generally can’t break skin, but .177 cal airguns can.  
But yes: not a "real" gun
4306 2018-09-13 15:42:07 そのうち倉庫代わりに本気でプレハブ購入してたりして…
4307 2018-09-13 15:42:06 You think about that CNY oil contracts more than its market makers...
4308 2018-09-13 15:41:59 Today is predicable as Trump rally dies because as I have said many times FADE's goal is Status Quo so oil getting hit, gold capped, stocks fading (Russell 2,000 down) Bonds up. #sigh
4309 2018-09-13 15:41:51 Coconut oil .... mix it with cocoa butter Vaseline in the winter
4310 2018-09-13 15:41:49 It's time to Standard Oil them.
4311 2018-09-13 15:41:45 There has to be a better way than making our teachers and students depend on oil and gas. We have tried that before. Kind of old thinking.
4312 2018-09-13 15:41:42 Rub some CBD oil on em!
4313 2018-09-13 15:41:34 why did you follow the rat into the feminist bookstore?
4314 2018-09-13 15:41:31 We're sorry to hear you experienced a stain from our markers! We suggest baby wipes, baby oil or make-up remover, if soap and water aren't enough. Since Crayola markers are water based, the stain will fade after repeated skin washing.
4315 2018-09-13 15:41:20 The father of a kid I coached gave me 75% off my oil change
4316 2018-09-13 15:41:16 funny how reluctant you are to name "your" company that does this. Where most companies in Gas and Oil and very particular where they get their products from...and that ain't Korea!
4317 2018-09-13 15:41:10 we all know when Mr. Drumpf has a toddler tantrum, his staff cries for mama #resist
4318 2018-09-13 15:41:00 I had just turned 20 and within an hour of seeing events unfolding I called my mother to tell her I would not be participating in a war for oil.

4323 2018-09-13 15:40:33 Kak iman, i need your opinion Should I try double cleansing oil dulu and see how it works before beli pixy or TO glycolic/ mandelic acid? Or terus beli chemical exfoliate je?
4324 2018-09-13 15:40:24 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
4325 2018-09-13 15:40:13 It was our fault. We needed to tell the US that there was Oil in one of the tetas of Cayey and petroleum in the other. Most likely this inaccessible island would of been accessible in like 2 days time. Ps. This tweet is an A+ tweet.
4326 2018-09-13 15:40:09 I too use coconut oil everyday. We now have big pharma shills pushing bullshit about how coconut oil is bad for us.
4327 2018-09-13 15:39:55 Someone told me to apply castor oil on my eyebrows  grabe! Ganun na ba talaga ka invisible kilay ko!? Lol
4328 2018-09-13 15:39:36 Have fun.  My aunt actually sprays a little olive oil on the molds. (she's italian everything gets sprayed with olive oil)  But she freezes them.  Have fun. post lots of pictures.
4329 2018-09-13 15:39:35 So #Christians are those vampires who strive on ME oil on one hand becoz they don't wanna starve; on the other hand, trying shamelessly to defame the religion of ME people. Oh #Hypocrites

Is this ur level of education u r so proud of? Void of basic values, no culture, ethics!
4330 2018-09-13 15:39:33 Bravo, Tom! Some misinformation in article—There’s no “need” for carbs; missing energy should come from healthy fats, such as butter, olive oil, full fat cheese, meat and eggs. @DrAseemMalhotra @DietHeartNews

4336 2018-09-13 15:38:20 I skip the mayo and use olive oil so I’m not far.

4339 2018-09-13 15:38:11 Just had oil from giardiniera go down the wrong pipe and this might be the most Chicagoan way to die other than drowning in a vat of Italian beef gravy.

4342 2018-09-13 15:37:51 I eat two tbsp. of coconut oil DAILY. You'll lose weight, especially targets belly fat (the hardest place to lose)
does wonders for your hair skin even TEETH if you swish it around. THE Perfect 'food'. Anyone just try it for 2 weeks, you'll see a difference!
4343 2018-09-13 15:37:30 in my house it is automatically assumed that i take care of all creepy crawlers, clean any overfilled gutters, clean the diaper genie's, do the oil changes, repair any plumbing, lift anything remotely heavy or awkward, and i have NO problem doing it. its the natural order.

4348 2018-09-13 15:37:00 1/4 of our import bill consists of oil import. Out of total oil import, 70 % consists of furnance oil and diesel. Furnance oil is used for electricity generation, if we use Thar-based coal for power production and railway as cargo instead of trucks, we can reduce our import.
4349 2018-09-13 15:36:59 "But I think the other reason President Obama doesn’t spend more time beating the drum on this crude oil production surge is that it is readily apparent that it happened despite his administration, and not because of it..."
4350 2018-09-13 15:36:58 Dudes really out here with no jobs during this oil boom

4378 2018-09-13 15:32:58 The GOV has Oil Reserves in case of emergency of fallouts .. Has the Gov ever thought of creating a LUMBER reserve to help out people in cases like this ..  ...
4379 2018-09-13 15:32:51 You mean these figures apply to the UK? iScotland would be away down the 'richest' list on its own. You don't know what oil and gas reserves there are. The wind and tide energy also apply to the EU. Why do you nationalists always feel the need to tell lies?
4380 2018-09-13 15:32:45 I have 6 oil paintings in my lil Subaru right now...Fern feels overwhelmed 
4381 2018-09-13 15:32:42 Mason, any data on mid-term impact, say 3 months, post end of hurricane.  Obviously Harvey is not a great analogue, due to infrastructure, but what about previous ex oil field/refining region hurricane impacts?
4382 2018-09-13 15:32:25 It’s amazing going for an oil change and not having 80 things wrong with your car 
4383 2018-09-13 15:32:23 I'm not talking of dam, usual remittances through proper banking channel doesn't reach intended recipients.

Do you have any new photos/info to post on Twitter from #Balcombe ? 
It would be great to see some new images.

4389 2018-09-13 15:31:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or the duty to stop it cold and she didn’t do it.

4408 2018-09-13 15:29:37 Good point. Infact if you check petrol prices in UPA time, it makes NDA look worse. Even when the crude oil prices were high,our petrol prices were lower. The Govt can't behind welfare schemes. UPA had several welfare schemes and they still managed to keep the prices low #modiout

4430 2018-09-13 15:27:48 By selling off our lands to oil and gas??? No! By increasing hunting and further endangering our wild horses and burros? NO!!!
4431 2018-09-13 15:27:42 "The AA said: "A spike in international oil prices and a huge swing in the Rand/US dollar exchange rate have combined to predict a knockout blow at the pumps at the end of September.

"Based on the current data, petrol users will be paying R1.12 more per litre." "
4432 2018-09-13 15:27:41 Yo I can’t afford a massage but I need one so if anyone is down to oil me up and wrangle me down Id owe you one.
4433 2018-09-13 15:27:35 Don’t mind me, I’m going to go listen to some Midnight Oil… 
4434 2018-09-13 15:27:31 Canada pays roughly 1.50 a liter that's roughly 5.80USD a gallon or 7.54CAD. They ship all of the oil they produce to the States, who process it and sell it back to them. A markup to world prices is imposed on oil companies, by their own government, who tax the sale price 35-45%
4435 2018-09-13 15:27:23 I don’t think imports count in these numbers (need to confirm). Did they have oil plants on the island?
4436 2018-09-13 15:27:18 3/ They could give @SenatorCollins & @lisamurkowski some cover, & Lisa knows the tribes who elected her are a NO.There’s not enuf oil & th fix that unless they do magic voter suppression &Russian meddling.

4437 2018-09-13 15:27:12 If that was true then abortions would be illegal. Also, everything we do to kill animals would be outlawed. No more palm oil collection since that destroys forests which kills life, etc, etc. Your argument is a joke. People don’t give a shit about “life”.

4446 2018-09-13 15:26:36 Yes dude India does , thought #pidis atleast know how to google  

Domestic oil and gas production in 2017-2018 grew 0.58 per cent to 68.3 in Million Tonne of Oil Equivalent (MMTOE) on the back of growth in gas production.
4447 2018-09-13 15:26:32 Palm oil, this is big
4448 2018-09-13 15:26:26 You should be! People like honey more than oil, or…y’know, something like that.
4449 2018-09-13 15:26:25 a good bacon sandwich with bacon cooked with sugar butter and oil, some chips (uk chips not crisps) and a medium rare steak?

4455 2018-09-13 15:25:29 When I were a brat the only use for olive oil I knew of was the tiny bottle my parents kept in the medicine cabinet for shoving in their ears on a QTip.
4456 2018-09-13 15:25:26 There are still 80 barrels of embedded oil in every car, extracting, transporting, refining, processing all the raw materials into components and then getting the workforce to each station to build that car's components, a lot of oil is used. I don't see mass hemp production yet

4478 2018-09-13 15:23:07 We talk about access to the internet as being inherently emancipatory, yet we also acknowledge the extractive nature of connection via data. Data as the new oil/coal, needing to be mined etc (1/2)
4479 2018-09-13 15:22:59 Another bunch of lies. No one is against green energy, but subsidizing any of it is bad and we need to move to better forms of energy production but doing it at gun point because of the myth of man mad global warming or peak oil isn't the way to do it.

4486 2018-09-13 15:22:40 Hmm ... looks like most of the growth in oil production happened during the Obama presidency.

4488 2018-09-13 15:22:30 Now if only you/they would stuff the KM oil pipeline along side 
4489 2018-09-13 15:22:22 Does Canada buy much US oil/gas? It is sold into the US pipeline system in AB, and bought back from it in Que., since Canada does not have a long pipeline system. If the energy east line was to have been built, it would have reduced that.

4503 2018-09-13 15:20:56 I just had a 1 hour Swedish oil massage for only 300 pesos which is equivalent to $5.60. Philippines is so cheap 
4504 2018-09-13 15:20:55 Thank you! You are so nice! My hair is super dirty, but all of that natural oil sure made it easy to braid. Winter of Braids 2018!

4510 2018-09-13 15:20:34 Protest march right now to 3rd & Howard, outside #GCAS. Demonstrators call @JerryBrownGov a hypocrite for not banning fracking, remaining cozy with Big Oil despite his clean, green image. Hundreds on hand.

4512 2018-09-13 15:20:30 Lucas oil stadium said in a dm that we can’t have them so they need to figure this out it’s ridiculous
4513 2018-09-13 15:20:24 it’s a 10 just came out with this new stuff blow dry balm that keeps my blowout in allll day and then I just use a reconstruct oil by kerasilk gold well for my ends so they don’t expand or look broken
4514 2018-09-13 15:20:23 A thought, your pig sonas literally cant nut in ppls mouths.

Bacon and pig tail are purely salty af. Bacon is so greasy you dont need oil for frying it.

Therefore their nut will give you high cholesterol and high blood pressure.
4515 2018-09-13 15:20:14 Lol yea I got u, I have really oily skin & I found that creams don’t work for me but adding an oil should help as well. Try argan, jojoba, vitamin e, or grape seed oil. Those are really good for hydrating the skin in my experience
4516 2018-09-13 15:20:14 At my house you will definitely find used oil stored in a clean pickle jar

4519 2018-09-13 15:20:03 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
4520 2018-09-13 15:20:00 They’re banking on $110 oil to keep the pace up. As far as core goes I dunno what’s driving it, but it’s still not that high at all.
4521 2018-09-13 15:19:58 During the global oil spike, sure. But it was lower in 2016 than now. These things are global.

These are the facts.

4563 2018-09-13 15:15:33 3 ingredients. 

Coconut Oil
Baking Soda
Arrowroot Powder

Roughly equal amounts of the two powders though I prefer slightly less baking soda. 

Then add the oil until it is well mixed. Add he oil slowly and mix because a little goes a long way. 

Totally scent free!

4620 2018-09-13 15:09:45 So you create all these at scale (+90 Million barrels/day), kewl, why aren't you selling.  I know you're not, but if you actually thought that it could be done cheaper than existingexisting, don't you think the oil cos would be doing it

4622 2018-09-13 15:09:38 WA was so cool. You could get; a bicycle, a rifle, a chainsaw, a weed eater, a little red wagon, oil and a filter and 4 new tires .... it was a store men could take their sons to!

4626 2018-09-13 15:09:14 Drinking oil is a terrible idea. It's so dense. And kinda expensive
4627 2018-09-13 15:09:14 It appears people are missing the fact that while a disruption could have negative consequences in the very near term, these would be short lived. On the other hand, provinces like NL & AB whose economies are highly dependent on oil will do ok short term but collapse long term.
4628 2018-09-13 15:09:11 For 16 good year with oil boom, pdp could not fix Nigeria and you want apc to change it in just 3 year. Epele sir not all are fools.
4629 2018-09-13 15:09:10 Do you know how cars are supposed to have oil changes every 3000 miles but it really can last 5000? Low oil warning pops on 6000 miles later in the dipstick is dry... Yeah I put a quart of oil in and I’m getting a proper oil change now.
4630 2018-09-13 15:09:04 Like the tractors. ... which needed laptops and internet to fault find and the poultry units dependent on subsidised oil or maybe the land registry which titled everyones land under one or two warlords.

Kavanaugh appointment? Follow the line even as it becomes clearer what impact this will have on American women.
4635 2018-09-13 15:08:39 Because producing oil here doesn’t really affect the global price of it.

The situation in other oil producing countries causes the market to fluctuate.
4636 2018-09-13 15:08:38 @DanRusso_CMT hello Dan. I recently subscribed to Mastering the bear and I noticed EOG which was bearish yesterday had it's power gauge change to neutral.

4641 2018-09-13 15:08:07 Your argument for Big Ag is specious at best. The need for big oil's involvement in Big Ag and it's destruction of soil make it the wrong answer for the future. And Big Ag only feeds the West, Family farms supply 3.4s of the worlds food.
4642 2018-09-13 15:08:04 As Musk said, in concert it feels like a sustained attack against Tesla and his personality. I don't think is much evidence of an oil funded conspiracy... just media sensationalism.
4643 2018-09-13 15:07:59 The oil companies refine 83-85 octane gasoline. Ethanol replaced MTBE as an oxygenate and octane booster. MTBE was very toxic and has caused contamination issues.
4644 2018-09-13 15:07:51 Do you think Canada should boycott buying US oil and gas?

Some analysts predict US production could reach 20 million barrels per day.  They are already bigger than Saudi Arabia.

4646 2018-09-13 15:07:46 I swear, if I see that video one more time...it’s an unnecessary amount of cheese, baked in an unnecessary amount of pastry, with potatoes roasted in an unnecessary amount of oil. Calm down and make Tartiflette with that Reblochon - it’s better.

4653 2018-09-13 15:07:18 As at 2day,Brent Crude Oil is $79.5 per barrel.WTI Crude Oil is $69.25 per barrel.Ours is Brent Crude.a $ sells at N361 as at2day.June2014,a barrel of Brent Crude ws $62.By Dec 2014,it ws $59;an all time low 4 over 2yrs
But even with the drop,Naira never did less than N167 to a $
4654 2018-09-13 15:07:18 Lets hope this is formulated quickly, adding more strength to the ZIOC proposition. Stability is a key element to developing a resource. It then helps Congo as a nation for coming years with an income stream to replace depleting oil revenues.

' bohut sara oil'

4659 2018-09-13 15:06:58 3/3: if the petrol prices are not to different now from then, how can that lead to a conclusion the author mentions? Doesn’t one need to take the key point of crude oil prices then and now?

Just asking. Neither pro nor anti. What is your understanding?
4660 2018-09-13 15:06:57 Wont be that many jobs if the O&G industry leaves. 1980s saw downtown lose 1/3 of its tenants when Oil prices tanked. Might be worse this time around.

4664 2018-09-13 15:06:36 Not surprised by Norway they in Norway are doing explendit oil trades with Maduro helping Maduro to avoid US Sanctions

4666 2018-09-13 15:06:27 Well now I'm trying to help you figure it out lol.  It may be hormones, they're so fucking tricky.  I'm going back on CBD oil as soon as I can buy some.  It does help a lot, even the hemp type.  I might start making it myself.  I hate prescription drugs and won't recommend them.
4667 2018-09-13 15:06:24 Well get em on twitter and let em represent. Oil prices nailed Venezuela is not controversial, unless you’re deliberately distorting the pain that country is experiencing to score cheap political points

4678 2018-09-13 15:05:08 Also skip the constant washing and scrubbing. That just causes our skin to produce more oil to make sup for the drying. Try a face cleansing oil. Seems counterintuitive, but it works.
4679 2018-09-13 15:04:59 Firstly, thank you (*blush*).

I believe that it's "McGnarly's Beard Oil"
4680 2018-09-13 15:04:59 Great illustration that principal post-2008 risk in current financial markets is not credit default risk, but the risk of a 1985 tin crisis level discontinuity in oil markets, where clearing houses are single points of failure on a massive scale...as I have pointed out since 2005
4681 2018-09-13 15:04:57 I agree with you that it's snake oil. However this message is a lot closer to sane left wing politics in contrast with recent TDS  behavior.
4682 2018-09-13 15:04:56 How did a handful of activists derail the backbone of the Canadian economy (Canada is a resource economy- mining, oil and gas, logging, fishing, farming, etc)?  Meanwhile talk is that the USA is now the worlds largest oil producer and Canada is being sidelined and discounted

4686 2018-09-13 15:04:36 You are a shill for the oil and gas industry. Two energy sources that are finite and WILL expire. We need to adopt new and emerging energy sources. They are always expensive in the beginning. Stop spreading false narratives that fit your lobbying. #fakefoundation

4698 2018-09-13 15:03:40 The US will revert to their usual protectionism on oil and gas after they see their aggressive estimates are unreasonable. Once drilling steps away from the sweet spots in the shale basins the production drops, more than they are willing to admit.
4699 2018-09-13 15:03:30 There's no oil in Israel and the Golan never was. Russia supports Iran and Syria to get a foothold in the ME nothing more nothing less.

4708 2018-09-13 15:02:49 Big oil literally had decades to address this, but FUD and obfuscation was employed to delay this. We should reward them for this? Less than 3% of Canadian labour is in the petro industry.  It's a disproportionate miss allocation of priorities and taxes.

4744 2018-09-13 14:59:38 Several years ago a Liberal Government shut down oil refineries in Western Canada from 5 to 2. So they could control inventory.  If you control inventory you control demand.  So we live in a false world of supply.  Control the inventory the higher the price the more tax we pay
4745 2018-09-13 14:59:28 Two words "OIL PRICES"
4746 2018-09-13 14:59:19 I`ll answer for you OK
1) Of course scots would be beter off with 100% of oil revenues
2) How can anyone be wrong in wanting to run thier own country
but That does`nt fit with my hate for snp so I will ignore this and keep on with the HATE

4750 2018-09-13 14:58:44 Yes there are! The oil industry has been receiving subsidies for over 100 years. Does that bother you?
4751 2018-09-13 14:58:43 Oil companies receive a ridiculous amount of our tax money already, money that could solve every water issue on every reserve, that could formulate a national pharma plan, and kick start a world leading renewables industry and solve many social ills.

4755 2018-09-13 14:58:07 yes subsidise solar/charging stations/increase minimum insulation requirements for building.
but we must become oil self sufficient, and that means exploration, extraction and refining oil.
oil will flow until a cheaper option is available, and solar doesn't get freight moved.
4756 2018-09-13 14:58:00 olive oil would fall under the chimichurri category, meaning that it would only be permitted for Brazilian fighters.

4776 2018-09-13 14:56:14 I don't even think people can understand how satisfying it is to just sit down and watch a bunch of random oil change videos all day
4777 2018-09-13 14:56:13 me: im wilding out tonight. gonna get fucked up
me: overdoses on fish oil pills
4778 2018-09-13 14:55:50 Need a new place to get my oil changed

4783 2018-09-13 14:55:10 It turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer's disease.
4784 2018-09-13 14:55:10 Arugula is just another kind of lettuce soooo

4788 2018-09-13 14:54:25 I was definitely drinking apple cider out of my ghost mug yesterday but wow just went through summer pics & I would really give anything to be floating down the river drenched in tanning oil without a care in the world :((
4789 2018-09-13 14:54:17 Any tariff would have a very negative impact on North Sea heavy oil.
4790 2018-09-13 14:54:17  My mom told him "It's a song. Hell, she listens to Kevin Gates and all he talks about is eating ass." I thought my aunt (evangelist) was gone die. She pulled out the blessing oil on me.
4791 2018-09-13 14:54:15 We agree with Who's Who Legal when they say: "The "excellent" Tolulope Aderemi is a highly regarded practitioner with extensive expertise in complex oil and gas, power and general commercial transactions, and energy-related disputes."

4793 2018-09-13 14:53:57 These politicians are great in diverting in passing on the buck. It's not only Mallya...there are plenty of misappropriation going on in current rule also Nirav Modi, Rafael deals, Indian oil & HAL loosing contract to government preferred inexperienced private org. Pls answer
4794 2018-09-13 14:53:49 Then people uses bateries as oil tanks....
4795 2018-09-13 14:53:48 Also unwated importants with good substitutes should be taxed, including cigarettes and other similar products. Knowing agriculture somewhat, I am surprized why we import so much cooking oil when we can produce good one indigenously with proper funding and training of farmers.

4797 2018-09-13 14:53:44 Yesterday, after buying a litre of it, I discovered that Canola oil stands for (CAN)ada (O)il L(ow) A(cid). Or CAN from the Canada company and OLA derivative of vegetable oils.
4798 2018-09-13 14:53:41 Yeah, Jordan Peterson talked about drinking olive oil to suppress hunger for his keto diet. You could also look up craving charts and see what nutrients best match your cravings
4799 2018-09-13 14:53:40 If I've learned one thing trading, it's that news event like the one on #oil supply record don't last.

4801 2018-09-13 14:53:29 With hurricane season on in US East Coast, expect crude oil prices to harden going forward. Meanwhile @IEA International Energy Agency says global oil supply in August reached record 100 million b/d, as higher OPEC output offset seasonal non-OPEC declines. A speculative flare-up?
4802 2018-09-13 14:53:08 Crude oil is NOT a fossil fuel and 'global warming' is a hoax concocted by the 'watermelons,' the red on the inside, green on the outside globalists/communists as a means of enslaving us.....

4804 2018-09-13 14:52:58 I’m not sure that’s true. People unduly extrapolate from the housing crisis and blame the mortgage derivatives. Nobody says synthetic corn or oil or pork bellies are a disaster.
4805 2018-09-13 14:52:38 Let's boycott US oil and gas too.
4806 2018-09-13 14:52:35 No they don’t! There is NO plan or attempt to get subsidies back. Oil has been subsidized for 100 years by the way, does that bother you?
4807 2018-09-13 14:52:34 Q dice mi jefe
4808 2018-09-13 14:52:23 This dude @ reliable oil is telling me he hates black people and all that. I should call in and complain to get him fired? #PettyWap
4809 2018-09-13 14:52:12 Ooooh, I don't know about that bottle of oil.
4810 2018-09-13 14:52:05 Eat your nutrients (4) Vitamin E also helps neutralize free radical damage from daily sun radiation.  Sunflower seeds and oil, wheat germ, grapeseed oil are good daily sources.
4811 2018-09-13 14:51:59 Sauce-based combat would put black fighters at a huge advantage though. Imagine Woodley walking to the cage wearing a marinade of cajun spices, olive oil, lemon juice and garlic powder, as Covington stands across from him, completely smothered in mayonnaise.
4812 2018-09-13 14:51:59 Wowzer sure that will surpass £1b as soon as the oil prices start rising 
4813 2018-09-13 14:51:58 Probably baking soda maybe with some coconut oil, a natural home made toothpaste.
4814 2018-09-13 14:51:56 Took a hit of a oil pen yesterday and slept for 14 hrs, I'm sticking to real weed lmaoo
4815 2018-09-13 14:51:47 Your brother an oil base go together 
4816 2018-09-13 14:51:42 No you’re not talking my ear off... I like it.. as long as you don’t chew it off.. hahah just kidding.. yes it is industrial work I specialize in building bio fuel plants the ones that have renewable sources as a base. I worked a lot on oil and gas Ind. But I saw to much spoiling
4817 2018-09-13 14:51:41 But of course more research needed! There may be a fundamental question about whether (social) idealists are easier prey for the snake oil sales team. Are they more trusting? Should they teach cynicism on #socent courses perhaps?
4818 2018-09-13 14:51:35 This is really insightful work, thanks for sharing! I am seeing renewed interest from oil companies in geothermal and this presents several viable pathways for them to get involved.
4819 2018-09-13 14:51:22 Don’t allow the dusk meet you without your hands dirty with works. For it is the filths in our hands that robs oil on our mouths.

4824 2018-09-13 14:51:05 If Florence meanders in southeast as it is supposed to do -economic activity will grind to a halt --further hurting oil demand & putting pressure on prices- might have days where its stronger -but in the end I still believe oil prices will trade low 60's high by end of year #oott
4825 2018-09-13 14:50:58 looking at the photo it's also no escape from congestion.....well until a couple of months time when fuel duty rises with inflation and Oil price gets to $100 a barrel......hope the camera's work to get these speeding and phone users off the road... Insurance dodgers next plz
4826 2018-09-13 14:50:51 I had the INXS guy, an REM guy, a Doors guy, a Motley Crew guy, a Rush guy, a Midnight Oil girl, etc. All of them saying that theirs was the best. Then there was me off in my corner listening to old country music getting weird looks from them.

4828 2018-09-13 14:50:45 Lol not just you. Avocado oil. Sunflower oil. *Canola oil. 
Expensive but serves the purpose. Or just mix the olive oil with the avocado mash.
4829 2018-09-13 14:50:39 late to the whole oil diffuser game, but it’s changed my whole life.
4830 2018-09-13 14:50:27 In my safe place of Kibo Midnight Oil Tomato Feta Soup recipe and none of you see what you said.
4831 2018-09-13 14:50:10 Yeahhh....so I don't think I'm going to get my oil changed today  it would be the perfect time to though ughfh don't feel like leaving the house

4834 2018-09-13 14:49:51 "We are prepared to take the strongest action possible" against those who are not williing to help put oil-related sanctions on #Iran in place, Assistant Secretary Singh states in response to question about the impact on U.S. allies of goal to end purchase of Iranian oil in Nov.
4835 2018-09-13 14:49:46 is it oil revenue or footy revenue
4836 2018-09-13 14:49:44 Whilst teaching a recent adult Sunday School class, I asked the brethren if they believed in evolution.....the answer was NO. I then asked if they believed that oil is a fossil fuel......the answer was YES. I then said to them that oil being a 'fossil' fuel is based on emotion...
4837 2018-09-13 14:49:36 That's a oil/vinegar or Mayo/spicy mustard.

One condiment doesn't do that flavor profile justice.
4838 2018-09-13 14:49:36 I’m no fan of recreational drugs because, truth be told, I get freaked out by a lack of control over my own body/mind. I am, however, learning a lot lately about non-narcotic hemp oil.  Shame that natural compounds have been tossed out for factory meds.

4846 2018-09-13 14:48:48 Let me educate you! The oil companies refine 83-85 octane gasoline. Ethanol replaced MTBE as an oxygenate and octane booster. MTBE is very toxic and has caused contamination issues!
4847 2018-09-13 14:48:47 He @khalifa_shema is just emphasizing that as a 'bahaushiya' she should be more reserved sabuda her culture lays more emphasis on kunya so does her religion.
So more is expected of her.

4851 2018-09-13 14:47:54 My dream was about vacationing at my cousin’s cousin’s house. The landscape was very hilly & interesting. There was a freestanding waterfall. I made a batch of what looked like hush puppies & danced around the stove sprinkling olive oil on them. Then we left and I forgot my car.
4852 2018-09-13 14:47:47 We have gas cans, propane cylinders, camp stoves, lantern mantles, limited supply of D batteries, lots of lamp oil, and Tru Fuel.
4853 2018-09-13 14:47:31 India needs a mega plant to mass produce high quality solar panels quickly : more electricity more saving of foreign exchange for oil n rupee getting stronger. Let's get on with it.

4855 2018-09-13 14:47:25 The state of pricing of Petrol and Diesel is out of control according to @rsprasad . So what the use of 12000 crore inventory gain by Oil marketing companies and why there is so steep excise tax and VAT ,Even when the intl. prices were low.
4856 2018-09-13 14:47:19 Red wine vinegar, honey, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and chili flakes. Great on lamb.
4857 2018-09-13 14:47:18 These 'protesters' were actually being paid by the CO oil and gas industry to harass people who were gathering signatures for bigger setbacks for fracking operations from places like homes and schools. Right now it's only 500 ft. These dudes don't believe in anything but a check.
4858 2018-09-13 14:47:17 Shah G olive oil and honey k badshah hain..
4859 2018-09-13 14:46:54 Actually only consideration right now is how to continue the spending of the oil funds thru the corrupt #Tripoli CBL.  The HoR has nothing to say. What corrupt #UN @POTUS @nikkihaley are doing is setting up the scene for the splitting into regions #Barqah and #Fezzan

4867 2018-09-13 14:45:59 The last line - I couldn't agree more. The key is the dosage. Getting it consistent is the issue because of the many strains and growing conditions. Plants vary between themselves, just look at a tomato plant, some good and some not so good. Perhaps making pellets or oil extract?

4869 2018-09-13 14:45:26 What people actually enjoy is usually not useful or productive for society. People ARE inherently lazy because laziness minimizes calorie expenditure on boring activity not essential for survival. You're peddling utopian snake oil.
4870 2018-09-13 14:45:24 I’ve taken a lot of Zofran and CBD oil.
4871 2018-09-13 14:45:20 The Scottish government gets a *geographic share* of oil revenues, and still it needs £13,5 billion of Barnett funds from the treasury to keep its public services afloat.

Because they would starve if they returned to the Phillipines or wherever; there's no oil there.

4887 2018-09-13 14:43:50 Thats crazy. How did you know to buy before that big spike? I want to trade only one or 2 securities like you only focus on oil but for forex. i'm looking at USD pairs. however Eur/JPY treated me well today.

4890 2018-09-13 14:43:40 You should spend your efforts promoting renewables instead of oil recovery economics.  Your economics will be sketchy and biased.
4891 2018-09-13 14:43:19 @SolomonSerwanjj let me hope u heard, read and understood abt that Memorandum of Understanding Mr. And Mrs. Museveni plus their in-law Sam Kutesa with the Chinese gov't abt that oil u  r talking about
4892 2018-09-13 14:43:19 This is d reason we said our central planning is faulty. Without first promoting and investing in farm gate processing like in d palm oil industry a lot of agric produce will simply rot away and farmers will continue incurring losses
4893 2018-09-13 14:43:11 I have to disagree, I believe Maduro cannot run the economy even if the oil price is $1000, he is an unprepared incompetent and was second to Chavez because Chavez didn't want too smart/competent people around him. Chavez was smarter and no classic socialist, but Chavist
4894 2018-09-13 14:43:03 Yes, you'll be fine. Aside from taking your meds eat healthy too. Add guyabano, coconut (juice, oil, etc. )

4913 2018-09-13 14:41:13 A lot of FBPE's also think they wont be able to buy cheap olive oil or BLTs after Brexit. I suspect I will be frequenting the same variety of shops that I do now.
4914 2018-09-13 14:41:12 Good evening, I am a biologist and my master's degree program foresaw the pathophysiology, I work with extra virgin olive oil for 14 years and I am very interested in the enthalmology and diseases of plants. If you are looking for people like me, I can send my resume. Thank you

4919 2018-09-13 14:40:50 Hi Ife. What other substitute can I use in place of olive oil? I actually hate it 
4920 2018-09-13 14:40:48 Wish I'd seen this before. You're probably healed up now, but for the next Sig slapping helps, or get a small amount of coconut oil and massage it, or grab a chopstick and poke around the lines but not on or too near them. :)

4928 2018-09-13 14:40:22 I read that paper at the time. Also, as you imply, weren’t there a larger number of cattle in the 70s? Most are only willing to change what is easy when it comes to climate change. It’s easier to blame/limit consumption of any/everything else in the world other than oil and gas.
4929 2018-09-13 14:40:16 Could very well be. I know the corn oil is supposed to add micronutrients back into the diet. We only used it until his skin healed. I hope you feel better soon!

4936 2018-09-13 14:39:54 Pretty disrespectful cougars will not allow red raiders to honor the cotton farmers. I bet it would be different if it was an issue here in Houston representing oil. It’s just wrong.
4937 2018-09-13 14:39:43 We can pray for ourselves. We don't need some homophobic millionaire peddling snake oil.
4938 2018-09-13 14:39:38 That’s what WE keep saying! So quit buying the snake oil!
4939 2018-09-13 14:39:36 Thank you for your support Erin but it may be too little too late. The anti oil message has taken a firm hold in Canada and Alberta is feeling more alienated than ever before. We no longer feel welcome within our own country and if Libs win another term we may see a referendum.

4944 2018-09-13 14:39:03 If Moe says they don't deny climate change but have no plan to actually reduce emissions we should believe what he says not what he does. Is that it? Understanding that #carbon pricing contributes to economies where implemented just not to the oil business

4956 2018-09-13 14:38:02 Also...considering that basically any manufactured product contains some "known, harmful substance" (oil, sugar, alcohol, etc) this is just a BS statement from some dude who drank too much drug war kool-aid in the mid century.

5001 2018-09-13 14:33:09 Against my better judgement I watched the full 30 mins. Stunning. The $TSLA price decline on 9/7 is attributed to “dumping” of shares by big oil at a price far below “market” value in order to “change the narrative” from Elon’s awesome interview w/ Joe Rohan.

5011 2018-09-13 14:32:24 What is truly bizarre is that only domestic oil considers all greenhouse gas emissions upstream to downstream. All foreign oil can enter our country without any of the scrutiny placed on it as if it shows up at Can refineries using 0 emissions to get here. Its a bad Liberal joke.

5014 2018-09-13 14:32:24 Oh wait misread - if imports aren't included, it's definitely the diesel and fuel oil plants being massively reduced in usage.

5020 2018-09-13 14:31:47 PEI never had a coal plant, but they did massively reduce imports from NB - and their wind build out (with a surplus/backup sale/supply deal with NB Power) mostly displaced local diesel and fuel oil plants. It's likely the drop is cutting those out, plus a share of NB's clean up.
5021 2018-09-13 14:31:44 There is a local snack in my mum’s place called ‘Eka Ghahe’ or ‘Kpokpo garri’. Its made by mixing garrison with palm oil. My grandma will be breaking it and chewing it like nobody’s business.

5025 2018-09-13 14:31:20 This is an area where government help is needed. Few if any individuals can afford to invest the needed capital to establish a facility that recycles plastic like we need. That being said the recycling market is problematic right now because of oil prices. China has cut orders.

5040 2018-09-13 14:29:45 By using more Domestic oil we could replace foreign oil that comes here on tankers burning 30 to 50k litres of bunker fuel every HOUR. This isn't a narrative but it should be after all its a global problem. Pipelines are the greenest way to transport oil from source to detination

You're pump dozens of different and dangerous chemicals into the ground, just to squeeze out the last few drops of oil. Fracking is absolutely destructive.

5196 2018-09-13 14:15:02 Standard oil was broken up in part because of their business practices including the use of favorable railroad rebates to control the refining business. After the Bell break up local phone bills outpaced inflation but long distance rates dropped

5270 2018-09-13 14:08:06 Great insight.
I don't have access to that granularity of data.
In aggregate terms I see quite a slow down in the competitiveness of WTI as a sought-after oil even when its price is now 9$ < Brent's.
This will become problematic when refiners slow down their neck-breaking race.

5349 2018-09-13 14:02:02 Are you suggesting taxes fluctuate and prices are stable? The thread started saying US had more oil than before so I wondered why prices went up not down. Simple query nothing more.

5351 2018-09-13 14:01:43 Mr. President we need you to carveout a percentage of output from the Balkan oil production for domestic use. To be priced out at around $1.75 a gallon. By the way if you do it, you will be a shoe in for the 2020 Presidential Election!!!

5363 2018-09-13 14:00:29 Thanks. I'm hoping to buy CBD oil, soon. I don't currently have a DR, & with cannabis being legally sold (here in Canada) in Oct, I'm hoping dispensaries (Nova Scotia Liquor Comission stores) will stock CBD. If not, then I'll need to get a DR's letter, so I can buy privately.

5377 2018-09-13 13:59:02 Not for long I would suspect. Lives they care nothing about, but OIL.
5378 2018-09-13 13:58:32 #ThrowbackThursday to the first recorded uses of oil.
Crude oil that had bubbled to the surface was used by the ancient people of the Middle East. The Babylonians used oil to waterproof their boats and as mortar in building construction.
5379 2018-09-13 13:58:32 The girl to guy ratio up here is so abysmal that not only does almost every bar have a weekly ladies night but even the auto shops have a day every week where women get discounted oil changes.
5380 2018-09-13 13:58:22 "Global conflict" isn't a viable exit strategy this time; US would hyperinflate a la Venezuela almost instantly, as US shelves would go empty once the boats fr China stopped, & once oil began being rationed like in WW2.

5399 2018-09-13 13:56:20    Satisfying: in low-calorie diets, the presence of olive oil is interesting because it relieves the feeling of hunger. In addition, its consumption has been associated with the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates moods. #AOVE #aceitedeoliva #EVOO #o
5400 2018-09-13 13:56:13 This is a living proof that the OIL had brought to Libya nothing but misery. All the fighting, killing and foriegn intervention is and will be for the NOBEL!! Cause of controlling the oil and its revenues.. what a Curse ?

5525 2018-09-13 13:43:40 I am sorry to hear this. I’ve cooked many a portion of sad-tasting Quorn pieces! I think the secret is to cook them in olive oil over a medium (rather than high) heat, and to keep stirring them regularly! That seems to stop them drying out. Less of a stir-fry approach, I guess!

5609 2018-09-13 13:35:36 To prep for #HurricaneFlorence I did a hair mask last night. And it was rose oil which I love but it is so Rosy  it is tangible. I can taste it. Probably just smell like an old woman now.
5610 2018-09-13 13:35:34 It's more than likely related to  Hurricane Florence about to hit the Carolinas. It may cause a disruption in the Colonial oil and gas pipeline and causing prices to rise in surrounding states. This also happened during Hurricane Katrina.
5611 2018-09-13 13:35:29 I live in central NC and they have already raised gas prices 20 cents a gallon and the storm hasn't even hit yet.  The oil companies r probably run by the left!

5617 2018-09-13 13:35:14 Certainly haven’t forgotten that - nor the number of Tory MPs and peers on the boards of oil exploration and energy companies. Looking no further than The Headmistress’s husband. #PeoplesVote.
5618 2018-09-13 13:35:13 again sudan, nigeria, venezuala or iran, are horrible places as well. If you want to restrict oil companies to produce oil and refined markets to privilege tha canadian consumer? I'm in. That sounds eerily like a national energy program, It's not what we have now.

5625 2018-09-13 13:34:38 Building sector? There is no such thing as building sector. Do all building owners form a group and talk about their energy use? Like oil sector or financial sector? What’s the point of this article?
5626 2018-09-13 13:34:35 Man, you guys are something. Your source proving bias is the Weekly Standard, which is owned by billionaire Philip F. Anschutz, who is among the largest land-owners in Colorado, a major player in the oil and railroad and a major donor to Republican politicians.

5638 2018-09-13 13:33:06 The EIA note that US "likely surpassed" Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's largest crude oil producer in 2018 is in stark contrast to California law mandating 50% of its energy with clean power by 2025 and 100% by 2045.  Hurricane Florence adds an exclamation point to CA law.

5653 2018-09-13 13:31:10 again it won't reduce any outside oil purchase because the companies will decide where the product goes and who they buy it from. Let's imagine a Saudi firm buys the refinery for the purpose of refining their product. We have no say or ability to stop this.
5654 2018-09-13 13:31:09 So how would your society run without oil?  Where do you get the energy to heat your home, drive your car, take a flight to grandma's
Where do you think Justin gets a lot of money for the Feds and AB gets a lot of money for schools & hospitals
5655 2018-09-13 13:31:04 That black seed oil tho...
5656 2018-09-13 13:30:53 Pl analyze everything with proper knowledge, don't do like pidi or kejruddin do. During 2013 oil prices were subsidies and government was running oil bond of 2 lac crores, currently no oil bond and no subsidy. So under congis oil prices would have been over 100.

5667 2018-09-13 13:29:57 It took oil decades to come to terms with the idea you have to keep workers safe and that profit should not come before best engineering practice. More or less. Mining still isn’t there perhaps because it can be so physically simple?
5668 2018-09-13 13:29:54 I hope that some of the trains would be converted to run on LNG. While it’s true that this will save diesel costs, the electricity for train use is coming from coal for the most part. So the dependence on foreign oil is at the cost of adding more pollution. LNG would be better.

5674 2018-09-13 13:29:17 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.

5676 2018-09-13 13:28:58 This thought in the article should be weighed against new rig orders in a recovery and developments in tight oil.  If the scare of EV’s keep new rigs away and we see shale flatline into 2020 and then descend that’s a lot of weight on offshore to meet world demand for a long time.

5689 2018-09-13 13:27:15 Furthermore, give the NDP a chance to see what they do when oil prices are back. Rachel’s reliance on the importance of fossil fuels is because for 30 years that’s all the PCs focused on developing. It’s the economic reality she inherited. She’s intelligent and has done fine.
5690 2018-09-13 13:27:12 Now, when is peak oil ??
5691 2018-09-13 13:26:54 It will increase GDP and provide jobs. It will also decrease our reliance on Saudi oil. Trudeau loves to bash their human rights violations and let's face it, Saudi Arabia is a terrible place, so why should we pump money into that country instead of our own?

5697 2018-09-13 13:26:03 Regarding Colorado employment what is your take on 112 which will kill most oil and gas production in the State?
5698 2018-09-13 13:26:01 That's why you disable the tracking device and plug it into a 12 volt power supply in your house so they think you never drive. And do your own oil changes because you know they'll have the jiffy lubes reporting mileage to them for audits

5702 2018-09-13 13:25:07 Thanks @miss_laming for the interesting articles. We definitely require more awareness about the disadvantages of Palm Oil and certainly more protocols in place around what defines “sustainable palm oil”.

I agree with you, absolutely: Subduing Syria, just so the Saudi oil can be cheaply  piped through it to the Med and Europe is not worth any more human sacrifices.
5712 2018-09-13 13:24:17 Indeed, otherwise, why would the BBC have emphasised 'from Scottish waters' rather than simply say 'UK oil and gas production has fallen'?

They produce their surreptitious propaganda daily, relentlessly, consciously, deliberately and with Unionism aforethought.

5724 2018-09-13 13:23:03 no argument there. but and again give jobs to refinery workers, is a plus and as a refined product canadians would see some of the product come there way. would not lower the price for canadians or see much of a benefit. Irving oil is an great example too,

5750 2018-09-13 13:20:32 Just doing some rough arithmetic and the current Mkt Cap versus your annual revenue estimates suggests p/e below 2. Oil producers should command ratings closer to 10 and arguably 20 > multi-bagger if #ANGS gets all three operations flowing as per the numbers calculated

5752 2018-09-13 13:20:26 Mood change. There’s a complex level of grounding when you diffuse and even wear an essential oil that fits yourself needs. Peppermint opens your sinus’ and pores immediately, patchouli helps your skin, frankincense can transform skin irritants over night&thieves blend is magical
5753 2018-09-13 13:20:04 it only works if you're storing the Dew in oil barrels, like a proper toxic waste storage
5754 2018-09-13 13:20:04 @PMOIndia @narendramodi anyone can drill and excavate oil kindly remove artificial criteria barriers and make allocation transparent as in current state it breeds doubts. Allowing all to drill will also reduce india's import of crude oil. Thank you. 2/2

5767 2018-09-13 13:18:35 Hi Mark, Iceland will stop using palm oil as an ingredient in all of all its own label food by the end of 2018.
5768 2018-09-13 13:18:33 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
5769 2018-09-13 13:18:32 No....it actually is due to NG. FPL has reduced it's CO2 emissions by over 70% by getting rid of it's old oil burners and replacing them with NG.

5773 2018-09-13 13:18:24 The houses in my suburban Baltimore neighborhood were built with oil heat. That was 70-80 years ago, and many have converted to gas, but I still see oil delivery trucks regularly.

5775 2018-09-13 13:18:13 Kindly tell us truth have you not raised the excise duty whenever the crude oil price? What prevents from reversing it? You cannot justify the price of petrol by putting the blame on UPA.
5776 2018-09-13 13:18:07 Our @GovernmentZA is flirting with major civil disobedience if they don't sort out this economy ASAP! The can blame oil prices all they want but economic policy is also to blame.
5777 2018-09-13 13:17:54 I think we should give them some oil fields as a sweetener. Otherwise, they'll just feck us up trying to leave, or they'll invade us/destabilise our government etc.  We'll have our renewables and all our other resources after all.  
#ScotlandCan
5778 2018-09-13 13:17:52 @PMOIndia @narendramodi sir kindly abolish net worth criteria and one year experience criteria in oil block allocation under new policy. It's a policy which favors few and harms others right to equality. It also breeds corruption. Make policy like in USA where anyone can drill1/2

5796 2018-09-13 13:16:05 Balochis can be used by China competitors (definitely Jap) to hijack/ bomb tankers which have a China destination which lucky enough to escape Persian gulf but they’re just one of the possible faction which might actually intercept China oil flow (I can think at least 4 more).

5800 2018-09-13 13:15:49 There is no way westminster will let scots just vote yes and walk away with thier oil and gas.
They will push for a "deal" involving scots oil and gas.

5831 2018-09-13 13:12:21 Instead of using turkey and beef, I use ground chicken from Trader Joe's. I  usually saute some chopped fresh onions in olive oil and throw that in with the spices and coconut aminos. I've never put an egg in yet, and as long as you keep an eye on them they don't dry out.
5832 2018-09-13 13:12:17 This ad should come with a health warning. Hydrogen comes either from methane, a product of the oil and gas industry, or by electrolysis of water which is hopelessly inefficient.

5851 2018-09-13 13:10:29 For the record, the RFS is more than just ethanol. And the U.S. ethanol industry hasn't had a federal tax incentive since 2012. By contrast, the oil industry has received subsidies for more than a century. W/o the RFS, consumers would have ZERO choice at the pump. That's not fair

5864 2018-09-13 13:09:15 Heads-up! @JKempEnergy reminds us that crude prices are re-entering the Tweet zone.... "Oil prices have risen back to levels that earlier this year prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to take to Twitter and demand OPEC do more to bring them down."

5870 2018-09-13 13:08:49 Generally $60-80 per 1000mg is a fair price for a high quality oil, just make sure you read reviews, ingredients and such, and full spectrum usually has a better effects from the full range of Phytocannabinoids. It’s much better than taking steroids and such!

5880 2018-09-13 13:08:01 Not all plants are used the same. You may see people use Violet as a tincture, while you they use Rose as an infused oil.

Choosing how you will use a plant is partly based on your relationship with the plant and part science.
5881 2018-09-13 13:07:38 Shey u get pepper and tomato plantation and fish pond with poultry for ya backyard
You only need to buy oil and Maggie
5882 2018-09-13 13:07:00 have you considered CBD oil?  RA people are seeing amazing and quick relief from RA symptoms.
5883 2018-09-13 13:06:56 When I moved from central Ohio to western NY I was shocked by all the houses that used fuel oil (versus none). My first house had been converted to natural gas but still had a fuel tank in the basement.
5884 2018-09-13 13:06:52 I just bought a cool new Xbox One  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
5885 2018-09-13 13:06:49 Can oil and gas students attend??#OilAndGasSummitUG
5886 2018-09-13 13:06:46 We've got fuel oil system in MD. Though we also have a heat pump as of last fall, so oil is just a backup now.
5887 2018-09-13 13:06:42 Bullshit.  Inflation and higher costs caused by your oil company masters and tariff bullshit has made life harder on 62 percent of Americans.
5888 2018-09-13 13:06:40 Realist thing someone told me : “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, and oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink ... Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it? 
5889 2018-09-13 13:06:38 maksudnya ocolang pake baby oil?
5890 2018-09-13 13:06:36 よいと思う、、、
5891 2018-09-13 13:06:35 But you don't like mayo! ;) I'm suggesting putting (garlic) olive oil instead
5892 2018-09-13 13:06:34 So I guess a simple mechanism made using a wick, oil and flame cannot be compared to a light bulb with filament.
5893 2018-09-13 13:06:32 ゲーム面ではまだ本編に伸び代があるから、やっぱそうなるでしょうね。
どういう方面になるのか楽しみです。
5894 2018-09-13 13:06:24 Ed, I usually agree with you, but not this time. This will NOT BE A RECESSESION...this will be known as the trump depression. Banks will fail, stock markets will fail, oil will cost a bundle per gallon, food will be scarce. The 1940s will look easy compared to TRUMPs depression.
5895 2018-09-13 13:06:19 Have you considered CBD oil for your poor dog?
5896 2018-09-13 13:06:17 And for this.. you have the right to have smeared palm oil all over you double edged mouth

5915 2018-09-13 13:04:33 If there's no bad rust, I use salt to scrub them, them I put them on a hot burner to turn anything left to ash and make sure no moisture is left. Wipe em again with a clean cloth. Once they're cool, coat then with a layer of oil like sunflower, corn, or olive.

5921 2018-09-13 13:03:59 Paired with Trump budget reduction in LIHEAP benefit, subsidising fuel oil/home heating for low income families.
5922 2018-09-13 13:03:57 Have you considered CBD oil for your dog?  or you?

5925 2018-09-13 13:03:47 Actually, I believe he knew oil was propping up his economy.  He didn't dare do anything major because it would spoil his narrative.  So he nodded to the NODAPL protesters to make himself look good to his environmental supporters.  Such a hypocrite.
5926 2018-09-13 13:03:42 Garlic olive oil?
5927 2018-09-13 13:03:35 Have you considered CBD oil for great health?

5931 2018-09-13 13:03:14 Side effects of cannabis oil can include a condition known as panda face.

5933 2018-09-13 13:03:04 Splashed with olive oil, topped with a touch of cheese and broiled.  Salt and pepper to taste.
5934 2018-09-13 13:02:59 They are not helping nature if the oil industry seels you the "green" gasoline more expensive than the normal gasoline <--- if they really want to help nature than they will not seel you the "green" products more expensive than the normal products .. its obvious ..

5943 2018-09-13 13:02:21 It wasn't unanimous though was it? Two Unions abstained. And the other oil tankers have changes rumbling in their ranks. Women members weren't consulted and @Womans_Place_UK are supporting members to address this. Follow them + @fairplaywomen to find out the impact on women/girls
5944 2018-09-13 13:02:09 These private companies contribute significantly to our gdp. They are very important and the current (new) regulatory environment is definitely opposed to them being here. If Trudeau wants to end the oil sands than at least have the balls to tell us.
5945 2018-09-13 13:01:51 They try to charge me $50 extra for everything just because of the turbo. And I change my oil with racing grade Amsoil for half the price of what they charge for shitty valvoline.
5946 2018-09-13 13:01:47 Retro with a defective oil pump?  Sounds like another motorcycle good for 20,000 miles.
5947 2018-09-13 13:01:31 Just bought an essential oil diffuser because ~YOGA~ and got myself a starter set of oils. Looked at the eucalyptus oil and thought "wow this will be great if I get a cold"

I have a cold now. Just in time to test it out.
5948 2018-09-13 13:01:18 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
5949 2018-09-13 13:01:06 And the hypocrites ignore all these ongoing atrocities on Yemeni poor weak civilians by barbarians using western sophisticated weapons. Shame on our collective conscience. We only see fake Syrian chemical attacks...humorous parody in middle East Arab oil areas..
5950 2018-09-13 13:00:57 AlQaeda called for more death and destruction to America on the anniversary of September 11th. amazing that the 'west' supports them in their current endeavour...but then again the price of oil dictates all

5962 2018-09-13 13:00:09 CBD oil can lesson any pain he is feeling. Have someone come to your house - most dogs hate the vet!  Maribeth Decker if u can find her can talk to your pup - seriously over the phone - it helps.
5963 2018-09-13 13:00:07 sampe sekarang masih bingung untuk apa kegunaan face oil karena wajahku adalah kilang minyak
5964 2018-09-13 13:00:02 After a month of using CBD Oil: quality of sleep has dramatically increased, anxiety is almost completely gone, depression has plummeted, appetite is back, feeling focused, and just happier overall.
5965 2018-09-13 12:59:50 A big part of the coming Blue Tsunami is the outright bias and information blocking by Facebook and Google. Conservative news, opinions and facts will quietly disappear from all media the public sees. Google and Facebook have more power than Standard Oil ever imagined!
5966 2018-09-13 12:59:44 People who get up this early to get their oil changed are annoying
5967 2018-09-13 12:59:43 This is something that was never said by a wealthy oil company.
5968 2018-09-13 12:59:42 Have you ever considered CBD oil for your dogs?  They are gorgeous!
5969 2018-09-13 12:59:40 Sure. Keep telling yourself that while we have kids in cages and public lands right outside of national parks being handed to coal, oil, and gas companies. Good job.

5976 2018-09-13 12:58:46 be it of whatever reason the up move is halted, INR,oil or interest rate, the correction provides and opportunity for reality check and for portfolio building, since the election is also getting closer market will be correct more than go up like earlier. If any quality stocks..
5977 2018-09-13 12:58:34 The drift is not of universities left, but of conservatives rightward and off into the weeds. Climate denial, evolution denial, results based on what corporations want rather than scientific consensus, fake think tanks publishing papers to obscure reality (tobacco, big oil), etc.
5978 2018-09-13 12:58:33 More people than you think. I live in what is basically the suburbs of Buffalo and a large % of the neighborhood uses fuel oil for heating (myself included). These prices are going to hit a lot of people hard. Glad I bought a wood stove a few years back & stockpiled firewood...

6013 2018-09-13 12:54:25 Actually use olive oil mixed with mayo and some black pepper very nice
6014 2018-09-13 12:54:21 Large part of that is personal greed,  Gen Wesley Clark private investment in #Kosovo after bombing Serbia to forcefully remove and occupy its province, ensured him 70% of mineral and coal mining rights as well as energy sector monopoly. D.Channey owns oil fields in Iraq.  #war$

6021 2018-09-13 12:53:22 Just remember. Regardless of the "we don't need it" theory regarding oil, it is not reality. I find it hypocritical considering the Saudis oil flowing into our East coast. We have the third largest oil reserves in the world and no way to get it to market. We use oil & lots of it
6022 2018-09-13 12:53:17 Omarosa and Trump are to of a kind, both are liars and bullies that turn victims. They are con artist selling snake oil, She was  paid like Diamond, Silk and all those bogus black pastors Trump have on the pay roll. #DonTheCon

6025 2018-09-13 12:52:54 Thanks, I'm pretty sure we will be ok. Water shouldn't be an issue. We can go to a spring and get fresh free water. Oil lamps on hand and well just eat a very high protein diet, just had 2 pigs processed and a daily supply of eggs from my girls. 
6026 2018-09-13 12:52:52 My coconut oil spilled all over my floor 
6027 2018-09-13 12:52:41 Don't Let Trump's EPA Gut Limits on Oil and Gas Pollution via @EnvDefenseFund
6028 2018-09-13 12:52:26 Absolute hypocrites the lot of them. Keep the oil in the ground and we'll burn as may pallets as we can to keep the country warm. Numpties
6029 2018-09-13 12:52:26 How about asking the Oil Companies if they are going to make money on this storm by raising gas prices and securing their profits. God help them if they loose a dollar. Profit fixing.
6030 2018-09-13 12:52:26 Pke rice bran oil belum tau sih perbedaannya tp klo dipke enak aja jg
6031 2018-09-13 12:52:06 @dpradhanbjp 
Howmany days the price of oil and gas will rise?
If this continues  then no vote in 2019.
6032 2018-09-13 12:52:06 At least we can use some of strategic oil reserves to help soften the blow...oh, wait...those were sold for 30pieces of silver!
6033 2018-09-13 12:52:05 The meth heads across the street never cease to amaze me with how little they sleep. They be doing an oil change at 2am, loading up some washing machines at 8, going for a Harley cruise at noon, rearranging lawn furniture the whole evening, and STILL have time to beat their dog
6034 2018-09-13 12:52:02 bio oil. tp kalo lukanya udah lama mending laser krn obat gak mempan
6035 2018-09-13 12:51:46 I called this one place for a oil change, they said $60.  Heck naw.
6036 2018-09-13 12:51:44 When you go in for a oil change and pray they don’t tell you nothing crazy 
6037 2018-09-13 12:51:24 Scotland doesn't have the Progress Party. Then this lot they're spending the oil fund like Santa on speed. 

Hopefully Scotland can show some fortitude and break away

6041 2018-09-13 12:50:44 You apparently didn’t read the article.  And it’s not about simple economics, to wit.  It’s about Detroit’s beholden relationship with big oil, and the entrenched nature of its pathological adherence to the ICE.  The tech is there for an EV pickup w/ AT LEAST 330 lb./torque... /3

6061 2018-09-13 12:49:29 I miss being with my friends.
6062 2018-09-13 12:49:25 Nigerians will decide that. We would rather vote for Buhari than bunch of PDP looters. Who wasted opportunities to make Nigeria great. Despite when the oil price was high, tell us what you achieved. We know this govt. is not prefect but it’s much better than you lot
6063 2018-09-13 12:49:23 In fact, we all really should know that they all are either underemployed socialists or unemployed communists

We’ll end child separation & honor DACA.
We’ll gradually restore sensible tax policy, as not to shock system.
We’ll restore the oil/gas rights back to the people. 
We’ll realign ourselves with our allies, not Putin.

6075 2018-09-13 12:48:02 That California and New York money is kicking in - along with the liberal mainstream National media.  Actual Texans don't want socialism, and end to tax cuts, a strangulation of the oil industry, the impeachment of President Trump, and open borders.

6077 2018-09-13 12:47:52 One time I used olive oil. Even a little Vaseline could work. Focus on the area where it's pressing the frame the hardest.

6079 2018-09-13 12:47:42 Thanks  yes it is yes, I'm also just glad to know what's been wrong with me for the last 10 years or more.  I've known about the benefits of cbd oil for a few years but have only just tried it, mainly because it's so expensive, but I have faith it will work! 
6080 2018-09-13 12:47:41 Well, the oil company would have the profit motive while the person receiving the grant funds is aiming to solve and fix the problem. False equivalency!
6081 2018-09-13 12:47:37 I hold the certificate of the Supreme Master Is there a human being and honorable human has to accept this to work in the replacement of oils and filters and have a diameter of one of the oil by the government of the government brought by the US

GEJ was more interested in giving out free subsidies without supplying anything &encouraging illegal lifting &selling of our oil in d region but did that practice help you as a person by any means?

6160 2018-09-13 12:38:58 Of couse they do. Facebook,  Twitter,  Google, all manipulated the news they presented,  the items they buried they didn't like, and impacted the election results 10 times more than Russia. Congress is to scared to do anything though.

6162 2018-09-13 12:38:38 All I know is I’ve heard many speak to this, and eating raw vegetables, and THC/CBD oil for reducing inflammation. It’s a fact that inflammation is the root of illnesses. I’ve studied this a bit because my daughter has Crohn’s disease and we don’t control it with meds.

6177 2018-09-13 12:36:01 note, as that article states some high income shifted their income to 2015 to avoid the higher 2016 taxes; as well, price of oil impacted high income  revenues in 2016. If G&M doesn't have 2017 data now they should soon which will give useful data on this

- Bhutan imports oil from india even after the imports and the local levy  fuel is much cheaper than india.
-- petrol @ rs 58/-
- diesel @ rs  53/- per litre.
Is this the magnitude of taxes on the Indian consumers or special price consideration to Bhutan.

6290 2018-09-13 12:21:51 When everyone was expecting President Uhuru Kenyatta to address the high cost of living occasioned by 16%VAT on oil, he resurfaces with unimportant issue of new uniforms on #PoliceReforms. Uniforms that look like those of a popular security guard company.

6292 2018-09-13 12:21:42 But if this agreement has been about sharing of the spoils by the leaders across the board; and they find out that the oil taps are dry and not much to gain being part of the R-TGoNU, then expect a fall out towards The twilight years of the transitional period. #SouthSudan

6312 2018-09-13 12:18:43 The innovation part is a bit different. 

I think by demilitarizing and banning subsidies for oil companies, there will be enough to subsidize public medical research.

That way people get healthcare and innovation, cleaner air and less deaths.

Unless you dislike that? #ProLife

6321 2018-09-13 12:17:59 It isn't just a money grab. The Russians are funneling money into the environmental groups to agitate against our oil production. Basically, Democrat American governors are now colluding with Russia to kneecap American energy.

I am TOTALLY BOTHERED by the McD ad before the starting of movies in the cinema.
I cannot stand the sound of people chewing  & the sight of oil when they bite on the chickens.

No, it doesn’t make me ‘terliur’, its the opposite. So i would do this 
6338 2018-09-13 12:15:51 I read, as this helps me to sleep.
But actually you need a good mattress, need to feel cool air around you.
Lavender oil is soothing, could rub a little on your temples or pop on pillow case.
Some take a hot chocolate drink, not too sweet with a ginger snap.
Think good thoughts.

6340 2018-09-13 12:15:39 Breitbart News is a far-right syndicated American news network that doesn’t believe in climate change, and doesn’t believe in alternative energy , like solar, electric and wind.  The big oil and fossil fuel coal will become extinct within 50 years from today.

6357 2018-09-13 12:13:54 How about letting the government decide our every move and what is and is not good for use? Pull your head out so you hear a snap. 

The founding fathers wanted limited government. There were snake oil salesman long before you and me. But the people made their own decisions.

6438 2018-09-13 12:03:38 Coconut oil - nothing, get extra virgin

Olive oil - just get it actually sourced from a country like Greece. Many fake olive oils out there lined with other garbage

They're not vegetable oils we're referring to.

6453 2018-09-13 12:01:56 Decided to not pay my part for oil for our house and just buy a new fur coat instead :-)
6454 2018-09-13 12:01:28 beggars cant be choosers, they need the money and oil. it takes a lot of political capital to say no to either.
6455 2018-09-13 12:01:16 The strait? Yes. And the oil delivery system. It is strategic for Russia and not for US. It is also strategic for the EU, which is why they put up with Erdo so long.
6456 2018-09-13 12:01:08 The U.S. surpassed Saudi Arabia to become the world’s largest producer of crude oil.

6462 2018-09-13 12:00:30 Having read your article I'd recommend you: install GT3 polybushes as they seriously improve handling and communication with the road AND a sports oil sump with bank separators - oil tends to move to one side in fast bends and often that causes bores damage.

6470 2018-09-13 11:59:15 If you look at CPI, then it doesn't show up, but higher prices of some food items are definitely due to oil price rise - I agree - but Fisc. Deficit is of bigger concern to many...

6484 2018-09-13 11:56:41 Good burrata is something heavenly. With a bit of freshly ground pepper and a good olive oil. But on a pizza -  too cold and soggy.
6485 2018-09-13 11:56:26 Food is almost as valuable as oil. With the United States possessing over 60% of the worlds food it would be a shame to have tariffs on corn, dairy, and soybeans. Don’t forget that the UN is paying their fair share now.

6489 2018-09-13 11:55:44 The debt to GDP ratio is what counts, and it's not a problem.  NAFTA is still ongoing. Canada's unemployment rate is lower than it's been for decades. AB's rate will remain higher until the economy diversifies b/c the oil industry has shed jobs that are never coming back.

6530 2018-09-13 11:50:23 How did revenue drop by 45% when the production drop was largely offset by higher prices, my thoughts are that Nigeria doesn't benefit from higher oil prices that much under PSC contracts while we suffer the hit for declined production, any thoughts??

6561 2018-09-13 11:46:45 Thirdly, not all research is taxpayer funded. Quite a lot of it comes from commercial interests: oil, pharmaceuticals, engineering firms, tech firms, etc. 4/n
6562 2018-09-13 11:46:14 What big agenda lies behind convincing people in climate change? I’m genuinely interested in why people who deny climate change think there’s some big government ploy ....There’s a trillion dollar industry vested in oil / fossil fuels, so if anything it’s the other way around.
6563 2018-09-13 11:46:08 I'm guessing the oil and gas/kerosene used for cooking came for free.

6570 2018-09-13 11:44:58 The @Our_DA led coalition now has 56 members only in a 120 seat council. There is no "DA-led coalition government". Are there people out there buying this snake oil off the charlatan hawkers? Really!?

6574 2018-09-13 11:44:41 I remember peak oil. Never thought I see peak demand
6575 2018-09-13 11:44:41 Food is cooking! My new fave salad is just getting a tiny cabbage and shredding it up with olive oil, salt and lemon. I would love to try cooking it like that though, I think I'll love it with some mashed potatoes. I already love stuffed cabbage rolls (golubtsi).
6576 2018-09-13 11:44:36 Olive Oil could have brushed it all, questioning in the jail.
6577 2018-09-13 11:44:20 Our Field Officer Shri LN Mishra (Mob - 9415902803) has resolved your issue. Please feel free to contact him in future. Thank you for patronizing with Indian Oil.
6578 2018-09-13 11:44:20 It is why I looked at it over 4 weeks and compared to the annual data. 4weeks are  good because crude oil production programs happen on a monthly basis and refiners look at what deliveries they have on a monthly basis
6579 2018-09-13 11:44:01 I'm curious what my baseline is with just taking CBD oil daily and using THC 3-4 times a week. I've recently been told to add microdoses of THC so...fak.

6582 2018-09-13 11:43:17 Have you looked at local indie makers? Tried solutions like the oil cleansing method? Or soaps made with high olive oil content?

I really like the Clinique moisturiser but I haven't checked who owns them recently? One bottle lasts me about 5 years!
6583 2018-09-13 11:43:09 Brands use the term 'oil-free' as if oil is the problem in skincare. Those same skincare brands sell skincare oils.
6584 2018-09-13 11:42:53 The oil issue relates to a series of actions by our government which have adversely affect the oil industry in Alberta .

6586 2018-09-13 11:42:13 @TalkYourOwn Certainly N300 is not enough to feed per day, unless if you're eating gurasa with oil. It's time we consider the prison industrial complex, not that I'm a proponent of it.
6587 2018-09-13 11:41:42 Yes but lead story on radio was production was down ! Then said revenue was up due to oil price 
6588 2018-09-13 11:41:33 I use a prescribed medicinal oil and it is allowing me to get off a lot of medications that harm your liver. I feel 100% better from aches and pains caused by diabetes and Muscular Dystrophy, IBS issues, and also heart burn.

6591 2018-09-13 11:41:01 Politicians are no longer serving the interest of the people that elected them ! It’s the trend world wide? All politicians do in Australia is point the finger at each other but offer and deliver only to their vested interest.
Oil and electricity companies are the winners .

6606 2018-09-13 11:39:21 You remember that red astromech from #ANewHope that Owen almost bought?

There is a story about him by @raecarson in #FromACertainPointofView and it just made me cry. 
This poor little baby. I wanna adopt him and give him all the oil baths he wants.

6612 2018-09-13 11:38:39 The difference between the US then and the US today is that in 1911, it did not take long to prosecute Standard Oil under the Sherman Antitrust Act. Today, with more overwhelming evidence against FB, Twitter and Google, we give the investigation to Sessions to get moldy and die.
6613 2018-09-13 11:38:38 Bold and direct move. I like this girl.
One girl takes a stand and all alt-right snake oil sales people are losing their nerves.

6628 2018-09-13 11:37:04 I was watching a food doccie and there was this woman who makes fried chicken in coconut oil. The way the people chowing were loving it, I was dying! I think I should try it at home
6629 2018-09-13 11:37:03 You're fighting over a worthless piece of desert that has no oil and no strategic value.

You're up to you're ears in lunatics there. You're fighting wars with an economy smaller than Italy. 

Can't last. It's all gonna collapse. I'm eating the popcorn already..
6630 2018-09-13 11:37:03 What? Common sense? No, this is our chance to grab all that oil.

6639 2018-09-13 11:35:26 Do not put butter or oil on the burns as it may trap heat &amp; cause burns to worsen. Instead hold the burnt area under cold running water.
6640 2018-09-13 11:35:24 Try menthol shampoos or add a few drops of eucalyptus oil into your shampoo when you wash. You can also try basing your scalp with the oil, but dilute it into either your hair food or a Base oil.

1) CAD increases
2) Oil Price get more money due to more consumption.

6646 2018-09-13 11:33:43 So study it's impact. US biggest oil consumer is now self reliant so others have to pump less or need offer better prices.

6657 2018-09-13 11:31:53 Solve the problem!
Let people:
Live under the elements
Live in caves
Synchronize thermostat to outdoor temperatures

Let Government Subsidize:
Wood pellets
Candles
Dung
Coal.

Turn off the lights & heat
The Left proposes those things.

or ...
Create abundance of Coal & Oil & NG!
6658 2018-09-13 11:31:42 the oil in this game is actually bullin loli pee ;~;
6659 2018-09-13 11:31:08 A few people have said oil. Which one you use?
6660 2018-09-13 11:31:05 Anambra state I learnt has been into export of bitter leaf,punky leaves .... Crude oil is also available for export
6661 2018-09-13 11:30:55 One thing that really helps is CBD oil for dogs.  My dog had cancer and couldn’t walk.  Within an hour of taking the CBD he was up and walking to the end.  I don’t think it extends life, but it makes it much better
6662 2018-09-13 11:30:51 Really? If demand for the dollar were to collapse (e.g. Saudi stopped using it to sell oil) how could the Fed keep creating it at the current rate without creating chaos?
6663 2018-09-13 11:30:50 And result of this meetings are what aid improvement in further structural designs. In big projects like the dangote oil refinery, the EPCM which is an Indian company only sent it's trained artisans (Site foremen) to Nigeria for execution.
6664 2018-09-13 11:30:49 Russia & China.

Leaving the Mideast is just a matter of time. Oil will no longer hold our attention. Climate will.
A major hurricane can't make landfall because the US is that hot?!
6665 2018-09-13 11:30:41 I do love the fact that you save on oil changes  and routine maintenance, but it still doesn't make much since compared to a gas car that gets 40mpg and costs 20k less. But I'd still get a Telsa if I could afford it. They are awesome.

6672 2018-09-13 11:29:29 I ran out of dry shampoo today, and didn’t have any baby powder left. I used my makeup powder and brush, and just kind of dabbed it in. It’s so light on. In addition, it absorbs the oil so well, and since it’s light, my hair still has bounce. 10/10- Would recommend.

6678 2018-09-13 11:28:39 But sir, even without going for oil bonds and keeping the petrol and diesel prices linked firmly to crude prices, didn't the union government increase excise on petrol as prices fell? And wasn't the share of the excise to be shared between union and states similar earlier?
6679 2018-09-13 11:28:36 In the grand scheme of things, calling an oil hydrating is a misstep. If you are new to skincare or you have a small Indie brand and have used the term wrong, it's ok.

Take the $9 million from oil company subsidies; they just have to raise rates a little.

6707 2018-09-13 11:24:21 Arstians are also specialize expertise. It's just sad that in Nigeria we have relegated them to laymen with no knowledge. In truth, Engineers and artisans work closely. For example, in the oil and gas sector, do you know that artisans do need some certification to carry out

6710 2018-09-13 11:23:55 Be careful with the stihl chainsaws! Mine was gripped with 10 hours of use and does not cover the warranty, for "poor lubrication", although I followed the instructions, with brand oil. They ask me 275 euros for fixing it ( I paid 635) @stihl_es #stihl @stihl_de  Nikolas @Stihl
6711 2018-09-13 11:23:55 That would be more than apt since data is the new oil

6753 2018-09-13 11:18:37 With all what is being said about astronomical rise in non oil revenues, the oil itself not doing badly in terms of price and the so called magic of Fowler, my layman’s brain keeps asking why the country has to be borrowing so much. #Nigeria
6754 2018-09-13 11:18:28 I suppose it depends on the particular oil and the fabric. So many variables. A bit of a lottery. Much like life 
6755 2018-09-13 11:18:25 Agree with the "Trudeau" name but it also comes with irrational bad reactions to. Like westerners disdain for NEP which ensured that oil production would not be a canadian enterprise and now try to make it a canadian oil issue rather than a private company's oil issue.

7002 2018-09-13 10:41:46 2/55: The health and environmental standards of Nigeria are in a very poor condition. In 2013, the Amnesty International announced that Nigeria experiences hundreds of oil spills annually in the Niger Delta, largely bcoz
of sabotage, pipe erosion, $ uncaring attitude by oil firms
7003 2018-09-13 10:41:41 "In what is largely seen as a win for the Libyan National Army’s (LNA) General Khalifa #Haftar, the US Treasury Department, in conjunction with UN, slapped #sanctions on Libyan militia strongman Ibrahim #Jadhran over the June attacks on the country’s vital oil ports." (1/2)

Diesel price has been gone up Rs 45/- plus since Sep 2012. If high price of oil is another factor,  then it started since Sep 2012, not May 2014 .

7018 2018-09-13 10:40:08 Gasoline cars are already being phased put in favor if electric, even the largest trucks can be made electric. The pipeline, which is already superfluous would be further redundant if the only use of oil we had was gasoline. Mostly we use it for electricity.

• Now, TRAIN 2 is also on the way

So. Alam na this.

7281 2018-09-13 09:59:34 It sort of is wrong, as it doesn't take into account the huge decrease in crude oil prices during BJP's tenure. But the benefit of that decrease was not passed on to the public.

7307 2018-09-13 09:55:58 I'm afraid the "excess renewables" thing is dreamland. 95% of H2 is made via steam methane reforming. In short, burn natural gas, heat the methane with steam and capture H2. It's terribly inefficient but allows oil/gas firms to keep drilling. That's why they love H2!

7342 2018-09-13 09:48:12 As has been said a movie is 'an impression of life', like an oil painting that is ever-changing. As Chris McQuarrie says I wasted 20 years trying to make movies of quality instead of movies that resonate (see 'The Big Country')

7675 2018-09-13 08:55:00 NDA messed up every sensitive issue giving ammunition to toothless opponents, now testing patience on emotive issue that is oil. We hv history of changing govt for onions. It's upto the govt. Simple math is bring excise duty to 2014 level. Else get bashed in 2019 & repent on it.

3. Let it boil for a couple of minutes. 
4. Then simmer for 5 minutes. 
5. Switch heat off. 
6. Leave with lid on for 10 minutes or so.

7776 2018-09-13 08:36:41 Ah, and the Italian outcry about the EU daring to allow in a LIMITED amount of olive oil from Tunisia without tariffs. Italy -imports- half its oil, so overall it only benefits from lower prices. Thank God the EU is big enough to ignore the olive agricultural lobby.
7777 2018-09-13 08:36:36 Are you for real? Why not demand free unicorns for all while you’re at it? The old money is dead and no one under 50 has any memory of it, and the $ is widespread because oil is priced in it. Only the € has a chance of replacing it globally.

7787 2018-09-13 08:34:31 after a wash, try rubbing in some olive oil through your hair. not the scalp, just the hair. it will keep the curls in control and give a nice shine.

7801 2018-09-13 08:33:36 Think about this... #Hurricane Florence is heading to the US. Trump's government has just killed policies making it easier for Oil and Gas companies to release methane into the atmosphere and to ignore gas leaks. Literally creating a monster furnace!

7831 2018-09-13 08:30:19 World as in W-O-R-L-D oil price hike is due to the ongoing geopolitical instability among oil producing countries. Excuse me, weakening of peso is the result of the interest rate increases of the US Federal Reserve. PH fundamentals is still strong.
7832 2018-09-13 08:30:14 Indeed, you see and hear them now because they are guarding and protecting the interest of the people.

7835 2018-09-13 08:30:00 Heating Oil Price Increase

The underling price of heating oil increased again yesterday by 0.29 p/L. US-Iranian sanctions, among other factors, look to be the cause of prices increasing and staying high.

7894 2018-09-13 08:21:07 @CNBCJou Goodmorning i think Oil Price direction is more Downward since it has reverse relation with USD !

Add that, 1 whole egg, and 1 yolk to a food processor with a big tablespoon of dijon. Run it for a minute, then drip add a cup of oil. Add about 250 ml of cider vinegar to finish

7942 2018-09-13 08:13:57 I still think the biggest existential threat that faces Nigeria are d quantum advances in electric vehicles and solar panels technologies. Even oil giants are preparing for the major disruptions in the energy field. In 20yrs, oil wont be worth more than $30/barrel.

7948 2018-09-13 08:13:10 The oil patch is not in trouble. It's shipping record amounts of oil and the oil sands have driven costs down to south of $40bbl. The oil sands producers have consolidated and have commenced automating. They are making money.

7950 2018-09-13 08:12:58 The Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg recognized as lawful the sanctions imposed by the EU about some Russian banks and oil and gas companies.

7952 2018-09-13 08:12:51 The price of oil recently collapsed, with a substantial decrease in revenue (96% of total gvt income came from oil). Combined with corruption and low tax collection, it was disastrous. Venezuela's not a great example for anyone. Denmark/Norway are better examples.
7953 2018-09-13 08:12:34 The 1980s was a money rich era. Today we live in a resource-rich era because we have enough #oil and #minerals to enable us to live, explore and grow as we wish. It won't last forever. #resourcerichera #environment

8088 2018-09-13 07:43:16 Is someone like you without common sense that does not know the higher the price of oil the more subsidy we pay. When oil price was down buhari increased petroleum and still paid more subsidies but you people with out common sense don’t see this bunch of morons
8089 2018-09-13 07:43:13 Absolutely. The original aim of the heads of government meeting of 1972 was to achieve economic and monetary union by 1980. It was only the oil crisis that scuppered that plan.

8153 2018-09-13 07:32:36 1 lakh 30 thousand crores of oil bonds which are unpaid bills of oil companies from 2009-14 was inherited from Congress led UPA. This is being serviced by the current government.

While one can agree with you wrt to current high oil prices, the above fact can't be overlooked.
8154 2018-09-13 07:32:20 Condemning their behaviour and labelling them terrorists are two very different issues. Simply condemning one country's behaviour still gives you the legal right to do business with them (oil & gas), labelling them terrorists means you must cut ties.

8205 2018-09-13 07:25:26 Inspite of subsidies it was 83 Rs then. Now it's 83 Rs. Without Subsidy. Will you speak on this ?? If you speak about Crude Oil Price I can say that. They gave Subsidies hence ppl never felt the pinch.

8212 2018-09-13 07:23:40 I remember a tip..
Avoid fats if they go solid when cold.
I never use butter anyway (animal fat) & don't like heating good vegetable oil.
8213 2018-09-13 07:23:32 I didn’t realise that Statoil is the Norwegian fully state owned oil company. Obviously BP was ours. How much of BP is still state owned?

1. Re from 58 in may 2014 to 73 now and going towards 80.
2. Don't compare WPI with CPI that too with different weight ages for high volume products.

Also remember the Crude oil price of $145 in 2013 with avg of 93 in 5 yrs to avg of $40 in modi years

8249 2018-09-13 07:18:12 Wikipedia skating over the theft of Scotland's oil: 
"Following the 1958 Continental shelf convention and *after some disputes on the rights* to natural resource exploitation the national limits of the exclusive economic zones were ratified. Five *countries* are involved."

8252 2018-09-13 07:17:57 The pipeline was never going to stop rail shipments of oil... Plus shipping bitumen as a "solid" in heated rail cars carriers much less risk then having to dilute it for a pipeline.
8253 2018-09-13 07:17:52 If you wanna catch it, safest is using a glue trap. You can nullify the glue with vegetable oil and the mouse will come right out. Gotta go release it someplace else though. Good luck!

8265 2018-09-13 07:14:54 Calling a 9 yr old a brat, telling her to go away, threatening her with expulsion (“kick her out”). Try doing that to the nearest 9 yr old you can find and I’m pretty sure her parents would consider it threatening.

8267 2018-09-13 07:14:35 Also, a focus on reducing export restrictions and making it easier for Nigerians to provide goods and services to foreign companies would help diversify us away from oil.

This would have been the best time for govt to have such a focus, unfortunately, this govt is blind.

8340 2018-09-13 06:58:55 For the longest time peppermint oil behind the ears helped me. If they get bad / frequent you might wanna go to your doctor and see what they recommend. There could be a medical reason behind it.

8357 2018-09-13 06:55:56 They most important part of medical marijuana is CBD. M.M. is in fact grown to have more CBD, where street marijuana is grown to have more THC. This is one of the contributors to the high price. Try local vape stores. Some sell CBD oil you can vaporize to get the calming effect.

8377 2018-09-13 06:52:06 Our federal government is a joke. Oil is booming in the U.S along with the economy. Luring businesses with lower corporate tax. Trudeau and Morneau have done nothing for our country and even less for our economy. Canada is not booming!

8412 2018-09-13 06:44:37 How can a mentally stabled person compare oil prices of India with any developed country? Ask the employee, who works at the fuel station how much he earns then compare it with what an Indian employee earns. And this is just a part of it. There are so many other factors!!!

8665 2018-09-13 05:56:54 price in INR to per capita income in INR ratio is correct comparison - and this shall be in highest range in India.

The price of ethanol is 30-40 Rs per liter. It may reduce our oil bill by 10-15% but for our country, it will do more harm than good. It makes the vehicle less fuel efficient, it depletes the ground water level, wic is more critical for a country like India

If he is on chemo cannabis oil.
8735 2018-09-13 05:41:42 No one wants to take sides on A&A conflict. But worldwide sense: #Azerbaijan is rich. Because of oil. #Armenia is poor. Because no oil. Worldwide sense Azerbaijan should step up and help Armenia poor. Tatiana

8739 2018-09-13 05:41:10 I put some black seed oil, ACV and a little  unfiltered honey in a cup with warm water, stirred then drank. I wonder if I'm about to get some of the best sleep ever.

8754 2018-09-13 05:38:50 Does anyone have any methods that help ease severe menstrual cramps? I’ve tried a number of things from peppermint oil to heating pads, but when they get this bad it seems like nothing really works
8755 2018-09-13 05:38:49 I gotta find me a foundation that’s good for oil skin & a good primer! I love doing my makeup but hate wearing it now
8756 2018-09-13 05:38:44 They are not real because they are not accessible. The oil,auto and energy sectors would be decimated. It is a national security threat to have technology like that released. The government has lots of classified patents that people can't touch.

8759 2018-09-13 05:38:16 What you suggest?Should we again start borrow from oil companies heavily?I don't think it'll take 20 years today we produce electricity more than we need,in 2013 we got coal only for 4 days of electricity production.Crude oil price inflation has been only 10% during last 4 year

8768 2018-09-13 05:35:43 It is clear as summer sky that LP and their allies are power-hungry and would possibly do almost anything to try achieving their goal. So all issues they throw at the govt are nothing but black propaganda. They were vicious during 2016 elections. Change isnt in their vocabulary!
8769 2018-09-13 05:35:32 Right? Soon to be legal in Canada across the board, I'll def use the oil... amazing!

8774 2018-09-13 05:34:43 Put olive oil on the pill and force it(gently ofc) down the throat.

My bernese had that power too, it was hell before i've figured how to do it.
8775 2018-09-13 05:34:38 Check out the pictures to see the vegetable proportions! About 2 kale leaves, 1/4 head cabbage, and a juicy tomato. For the dressing it’s very tweakabke depending on your tastes, but I did 2 tablespoons oil, 2-3 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar, and 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
8776 2018-09-13 05:34:27 Modiji oil ke rate Nahi kam karenge kyu ki 2019 ke election ka kharch jo nikal me ka hay
8777 2018-09-13 05:34:06 First of all,driving the car when you have an oil spillage, surely you should have listened to the warming light?!?you park that whip and holla at BMW on call immediately. 
Secondly,how do you have an M4 and NO insurance?!?

Ja noh the man has a serious battle on his hands 
8778 2018-09-13 05:34:02 Oil price outrage was never urban phenomenon...
8779 2018-09-13 05:33:52 Govt can decide on an optimum price for these petroleum products and the losses/gains set off against special bonds to be issued in favour of the oil companies !
8780 2018-09-13 05:33:48 What happened to that fatal disease you supposedly had? You know the one you dumped Bambi Jr over? Now you accuse someone of being a schill, what snake oil you push in’  this week Monty??

8782 2018-09-13 05:33:29 Is it just me or is having a Bishops Meeting to talk about protecting children a bit like hiring an oil baron to head the EPA?
8783 2018-09-13 05:33:08 Give me examples in Alaska to prove your statement???? You use every benefit of mining/oil & gas to fight your cause (gas to drive your car, Mining that provides minerals to create your phone/computer/the internet, oil/gas for electricity to light your house/run your computer).
8784 2018-09-13 05:33:06 I've got a great idea, the greatest idea, just the best: sell the strategic oil reserve to the Boston Redsox. Either that, or put it on eBay
8785 2018-09-13 05:33:03 Your family must be so proud of you for being a history teacher. Bet they would have rather you were a oil exec so you could have provided a bit more than you did.

8787 2018-09-13 05:33:00 They all have oil and natural gas.  But largely they have access and are in the path of any rail or pipeline east.  I don't know if we're ready to go there or even expend as much FP capital, but it has an interesting Wild West vibe.
8788 2018-09-13 05:32:51 Oil exports out of the Houston/Galveston ports exceeded imports for the first time in history this summer.  I don't care who you work for, or what your job is - you cannot change the fact that exports exceeded imports for the 1st time in history.

8797 2018-09-13 05:31:39 If they lose, then would we accept that it happened due to Petrol prices? Personally I don't think that college elections would get decided due to oil prices. It's a college for God sake not a state.

Just asking.
Your hair is the reason oil prices have gone up
8809 2018-09-13 05:28:56 Wouldn't hold up w mayo or oil & vinegar
8810 2018-09-13 05:28:54 Witch hazel, apple cider vinegar, lemon, TEA TREE OIL, honey, aloe, coconut oil. Skin peels work too but just make sure to keep your skin hydrated. I use rose hip to keep my skin dewy and happy.

8815 2018-09-13 05:28:03 I only took a few classes in oil painting in college for my major (Fine Arts).
It's not a case of hard to do or mastering it. I'd possibly take up oil painting again but it's expensive and I don't have the proper studio space for it.
That said, if you want to, go for it.
8816 2018-09-13 05:27:48 Political stability was very important factor along with decrease in crude oil price hence 2004 would have been sweet spot for any finance minister..They kept oil price at moderate level and added hell lot of money to economy..He was luckiest finance minister- P.S
8817 2018-09-13 05:27:47 Poha masala of the saraswats, also used in curries sometimes. But oil, mustard seeds kadipatta haldi chilli.powder jeera powder coriander powder and some of this poha masala mixed with fresh coconut, salt and jaggery - added to the thin poha - mix and eat!
8818 2018-09-13 05:27:26 Charcoal to open pores
Witch Hazel to close them
Coconut oil to hydrate my thirsty flesh
Tea tree oil to dry 'em out.

All this, and a virgin sacrifice to my Satanic overlord, and my skin still looks like a crusty desert.
What even is skincare, man?
8819 2018-09-13 05:27:00 لاتتهتميين لمن يرد عليك حين تبين الحقيقة لا يرد عليك الا ذباب عزمي والخميني بعدت حسابات وهميه فهولاء لادين ولا اخلاق تردعهم لعنهم الله فقط هدفهم وسعيهم هدف شيطاني وهو تشويه صورة السعوديين رجال ونساء وسيتمرون وهذا عملهم ولايصدقهم الا كل حاقد وجاهل ومنحل  وجميعهم لا معنى لهم فقط
8820 2018-09-13 05:26:48 Yes it does. It contains coconut oil, vitamin e and other essential oils that help with deep moisture and restoring skin elasticity and tone.
8821 2018-09-13 05:26:39 Cannabis oil for starters. There's a lot of things believe me bro!
8822 2018-09-13 05:26:34 I think Max is well aware that he is a petty little snake oil salesmen. At best his argument would be "homogeneity doesn't guarantee success" which no thinking person could think of a reply to Tucker's monologue. But mentioning North Korea makes his stupid fans feel afraid.
8823 2018-09-13 05:26:13 Sana kapag napatunayan n nandaya makasuhan ng Rebelyon hano, kase Republika na ng Pilipinas yung niloko nila
8824 2018-09-13 05:25:45 What a well thought out and reason response. I can object to fracking and still recognize that as a society we are dependent on oil. It is simply an unacceptable method of obtaining it.
8825 2018-09-13 05:25:39 “Oil and gas being non-renewable and finite resources, Uganda needs to ensure that the resource is managed efficiently and managing them in a manner that will create lasting benefits to society.” #OilAndGasSummitUG

8828 2018-09-13 05:25:23 Oil is not actually in Edmonton. The oil fields are about 435 km (270 miles) north. The city close by there has a population of 67,000 people. That does not include all the people that work and live in camps in the oil fields.
8829 2018-09-13 05:25:22 Also who rubs oil on someone without doing that? Lmao

8844 2018-09-13 05:22:17 Cholesterol increases in one’s body due to metobolism issue and there is no proof medically that’s becoz of Oil consumption . In fact doctors recommend easy fats such as Ghee and Nut based oil as good cholesterol

8845 2018-09-13 05:22:14 Gonna hit you up with some male privilege rn, went to the barber, got a wash, cut, clipper sides, hot shave (neck), beard shaping (jawline), aftershave & beard oil for 46 bucks. Don't @ me ladies 
8846 2018-09-13 05:22:12 I guess, Mediterranean style would be to mix (sheep) feta with goat cheese and some corsican cheese, black olives and olive oil... maybe some paprika and dried tomatoes for extra filling.

8854 2018-09-13 05:21:33 I rebatchednmy soap.Had shared the photos on the natural soap making group & they said rebatching was the best option. Basically chopping it into minute pieces, adding a little water and the approx oil that may have oozed out earlier and then melting it down to a gooey stage ..
8855 2018-09-13 05:21:14 That is really cool!!! Is oil painting hard to do and master?

8859 2018-09-13 05:20:49 Prohibition?!? You've obviously never heard of the days of Oakbank home brew. Clear as the falling rain, a kick like a mule, and if you needed to remove oil based paint or varnish it beat hell out of any commercial paint remover.

8876 2018-09-13 05:16:17 Congratulations. You should be proud that your country does not need to rely on foreign countries for your oil supply. Here in Australia we have the highest gas and clean coal reserves, 45% of the worlds uranium reserves yet we have the highest energy prices in the world

8879 2018-09-13 05:15:56 This day last year I knew our baby was going to come. I was obsessed with the idea of getting an oil diffuser so I went to a shopping centre + waddled around. I got Chinese food + my tummy was so big I knocked over a bunch of condiments. I came home and took a long nap. (1/2)

8947 2018-09-13 05:04:37 For eg: out of the Rs 80.73/litre  of petrol in Delhi on Sep 10 - Rs 40.45 went to Indian Oil, Rs 19.48 went to the center as excise duty, and Rs 17.16 went to the Arvind Kejriwal government as VAT. The rest -- Rs 3.64 -- was the commission that the petrol pump dealer earned.

8952 2018-09-13 05:03:47 I don’t have a problem with using less & protecting the environment. But one of the ways we can do that is by using US oil.

So they're multi-purpose, and I've eaten worse things.

8958 2018-09-13 05:03:01 The flow of cash halted nearly three years ago, however, when Venezuela asked for a change of payment terms amid falling oil prices and declining crude output that pushed its state-led economy into a hyperinflationary collapse.
8959 2018-09-13 05:02:50 From my experience & my clients, washing your hair everyday is no bueno. If your hair is lacking oil, & is too stiff there are so many products to help that. Unfortunately it’s a lot of trial and error & asking a professional which products could fix your problem.
8960 2018-09-13 05:02:46 Over a decade, China plowed more than $50 billion into Venezuela through oil-for-loan agreements that helped Beijing secure energy supplies for its fast-growing economy while bolstering an anti-Washington ally in Latin America.

8993 2018-09-13 04:59:38 Its not going to decline according to almost every economist out there. There is real unbudgeted uncertainty out there. And we have a very unstable president who hates Trudeau. NAFTA is in real trouble and so is the oil patch.
8994 2018-09-13 04:59:22 Yeah, that’s annoying. There’s a lot of personal insecurity that should not ideally block informed opinion from any corner of globe.
8995 2018-09-13 04:59:06 Is there any oil exploration in Arabian sea or any other part? Our oil import has perhaps widened the import export gap resulting depreciation of R/value
GOI must try to narrow down the gap that too immediately

9001 2018-09-13 04:58:32 Thanks for clarifying. I actually only trust your words when it comes to Bay Area raiders coverage. You’ve always taken the let’s wait and see approach while everyone adds oil to fire. You’ve never called Gruden and idiot but many many Bay Area media did or implied
9002 2018-09-13 04:58:26 I think I put too much lavender oil in my diffuser MY EYES ARE ON FIRE.
9003 2018-09-13 04:58:17 You’re no longer going to use soybean oil in your products?
9004 2018-09-13 04:58:05 Bro it’s such process straightening my hair like I gotta do a whole conditioning treatment, then put oil in my hair while it air dries all night and in the morning I gotta put heat protectant and silk drops just so it can look decent. I hate having mix girl hair
9005 2018-09-13 04:58:02 Lol I hate when dealers got bunk shit and then they like “man this some gas” you get it, and it’s motor oil
9006 2018-09-13 04:57:43 Mr Stump needs a hot oil treatment on the mile long hair. Lookin as dry as filter lint.
9007 2018-09-13 04:57:29 did you forget that he stone election from Gore and that he invaded a country that never attacked us, all to get their oil?

9010 2018-09-13 04:57:20 @narendramodi @AmitShah @RahulGandhi @arunjaitley @republic There is a saying for the way govt is handling oil prices(by not bringing in GST, hikes, tax loot, blame game etc.) "Apne pair pe kulhadi marna".They don't think it will affect their election.

9013 2018-09-13 04:56:48 During Obama’s term, US oil production increased by 74% from 5.1 to 8.9 million barrels a day, despite those regulations. I’m sure it can get even higher with reduced regulations. How much and at what cost, is debatable.
9014 2018-09-13 04:56:39 And if you want to talk about gutting fiscal capacity, we have uncertainty over free trade, investment in Canada leaving from the oil patch and huge deficits for the forseeable future. Using your data here, Trudeaus ratio is no better then Harpers average and hes still got 2 yrs.

9016 2018-09-13 04:55:46 Five factors decide the retail fuel price in india ;
1.Price of crude oil import and the value of the rupee against the US dollar.
2. Freight charge of transportation of fuel to pumps.
3. Pump dealer commission.
4. Central excise duty.
5. State VAT.

9027 2018-09-13 04:54:46 The changes concerning the dollar, you'll see already in the next months. First the EU oil & gas acquisition will be switched to €. Then the US will be switched out from SWIFT paying system, wich is European.
9028 2018-09-13 04:54:43 Really laudable and timely decision of the Government to help increase domestic production of oil and gas.

9045 2018-09-13 04:51:46 Dollar is becoming stronger against all other currencies also. Crude oil price rise is also a reason. No big investment has been done since independence on r&d in oil exploration.

9137 2018-09-13 04:39:22 Says snowflake Rob. The quality of “reporting” has never been lower, Emily and Rob are prime examples of fake news pushers, with their biased subjective views getting in the way of the truth. Why not do a fantastic piece about oil security in the uk and how #ukog can save the day

9143 2018-09-13 04:38:38 For some reason, the purchase of beard oil and research into remote home security cameras became essential tasks at 5:15am.
9144 2018-09-13 04:38:35 My Australian Shepherd has developed a debilitating fear of thunderstorms lately. We've had a lot this past week in Houston. I bought her calming treats with hemp and CBD oil. Gave her a few to test them out. She's now staring out windows and wandering around the house quietly.
9145 2018-09-13 04:38:33 yeah, that's what i did a few days after i bought it. had them suck out as much as they could and then refill. close enough for me.  but you should def do that pronto. oil change at least once a year even if you don't put many miles on it.
9146 2018-09-13 04:38:20 Thank you  .....gotta thank coconut oil

9152 2018-09-13 04:35:57 What’s the harm in moving towards environmental friendly reusable energy sources? Coal and oil aren’t clean and efficient in the long run. In the end, those who want less government regulation and intervention shouldn’t be looking to the government for help these days
9153 2018-09-13 04:35:55 Have you seen oil money..because me I havnt seen o..so I dunno 
9154 2018-09-13 04:35:54 And the 3-fold drop in oil prices that duped a generation into believing the GOP had a clue about the economy.
9155 2018-09-13 04:35:49 Our gvts are reluctant to adopt other alternatives because they heavily rely on fossils fuel.The fortunes 500 do not want them because it means heavy losses for oil companies.

9162 2018-09-13 04:33:59 You mean the regime that the americans cant control so they can squander their oil reserves and are using every trick in the book to bring them down? That one?
9163 2018-09-13 04:33:58 Govt salivating at increased tax revenues due to rupee value depreciation! No call is taken by RBI or FM to stabilise rupee! Why? When Govt can increase excise when oil prices fell, why can't you reduce excise correspondingly, if not more? Keep excise at UPA time for same prices.
9164 2018-09-13 04:33:49 All this food waste could be turned into clean renewable energy. Come discuss how to make that happen at IIT Delhi with Bigfin India, Indian Oil and SS Gas Lab on National Biogas Day this Saturday!

9166 2018-09-13 04:33:41 Y are you bringing this again!! Truth is from last 4 years there is a decline in oil prices.. your govt introduced additional 15rs taxes which UPA didn’t do!! Highlight the achievements which u actually deserve!! Not this one!!
9167 2018-09-13 04:33:36 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

9179 2018-09-13 04:31:49 There has to be a balance. They never let us have the benefit of low oil cost and went on raising it day by day. With oil up and consumers paying much more, thanks to GST, food prices are horribly up to say nothing of the DeMo circus.

9183 2018-09-13 04:31:26 Oil prices are not determined in India. We pay the suppliers market rate. and you were in the govt for 70 years. I used to buy petrol at 18.70 in the 1980's. how come it was 43rs in 1990's? It was your govt! #CongressKeGunde #CongressMuktBharat #BJP
9184 2018-09-13 04:31:23 They took a step back when they approved CBD oil for seizures by prescription only and decided (yet to be challenged) all other products w/ CBD oil regardless of taces to no THC were forbidden.
9185 2018-09-13 04:31:21 Oh this is v good to know. I took mine to the dealership, which I don’t normally do for an oil change but needed to ask about my transmission recall so wanted to be efficient. Lol 
9186 2018-09-13 04:31:19 I am a 30 year energy industry professional with a highly technical background.  You do not want to try and argue about how we can shift to solar and wind with me.  I have hands on experience with this.  There is a reason why we are drilling for oil.
9187 2018-09-13 04:31:12 Ah I see...I do use coconut oil...but cocoa butter lotion is just so strong lol...what kind you suggest since it help with skin
9188 2018-09-13 04:31:04 And this statement just isn't true unless your car gets over 100 mph and doesn't require oil changes.

9207 2018-09-13 04:27:45 He never promised it would be what you are saying.  We don't need that many coal jobs when we have oil to produce.  But coal jobs are increasing, and it will always be a segment.  Why would you consider that fail when it is all positive?  I don't get it.

It's the pharmaceutical company's shot.

And I'm not buying one.

Wouldn't it be nice if the Higi station didn't blast advertisements for such snake oil products, while it's taking our blood pressure? 

Too much to ask, that the companies stop f-ing spamming?

9241 2018-09-13 04:23:16 there are feedback loops which might cause oil companies to collapse before the target date. for example, if oil companies cannot continue to grow, their political influence will decrease, causing less climate denial, and so on.

9280 2018-09-13 04:16:22 Clearly. CO2 is breathable but too much is harmful to the eco-balance of the planet. However, Trump’s policy of burning coal and oil instead of using wind and solar power is creating pollution, not just CO2 which is my point. I’m sure you are not really that stupid!

9293 2018-09-13 04:15:41 This is just becoming a case of the GOP raiding the treasury. They're just stealing the nation's wealth for themselves and all their 1% cronies. And that's on top of stealing our public lands to sell leases to their cronies in the oil and gas industries. Kleptocracy at its worst.

9297 2018-09-13 04:15:01 Heroin mob $$ and getting a pipeline across Afghanistan are the reason Russia and Big Oil funded GOP decided to form their unholy alliance. One has to wonder then if elements of the GOP weren’t involved in 9/11.

9330 2018-09-13 04:10:54 You underestimate the economic significance of energy independence.  Exports of oil in the port of Houston/Galveston have passed up imports for the first time in history.  That is real and measurable and has a huge impact on our bottom line.

Democrats have been peddling that BS but looking here...

9375 2018-09-13 04:05:54 They may not be the biggest consumer of oil in its petrol form but like i said alot is connected to it. For example fare, electricity, freight cost of moving food from source to outlet etc.
9376 2018-09-13 04:05:47 What advice can Trinidad and Tobago give Guyana about oil, Trinidad is in a mess 
9377 2018-09-13 04:05:47 The one positive thing from high crude price is that its forcing to look at alternatives like bio-fuel, e-railways, e-cars, e-buses. Hoping for e-trucks soon

Time to break free from Big Oil.

9381 2018-09-13 04:05:21 Very correct. Some people react to (hypersensitive) coconut oil. Stop it and observe, you may be among the few that reacts to it. In that case, you find an alternative like Virgin Olivecoil.

9391 2018-09-13 04:04:33 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong, and is cheaper than shop-bought manicure oils.
9392 2018-09-13 04:04:33 Also get your hands on some castor oil and put like 5 drops of it into your shampoo bottle. You can also massage it onto your scalp 30 minuets before you shower! Works wonders!!!

9413 2018-09-13 04:02:05 I'm also "technically worried" about Otedola's decision to do politics. Stella Oduah was stupendously rich before becoming Minister (owns Seapetrol UK & Nig) same with our foremost Master Mariner, Captain Iheneacho of Integrated Oil & Gas but politics messed them up.

9430 2018-09-13 03:58:38 Hi. I lived on two Caltex oil leases just north of the equater: One named Minas and the other Duri. Both were fairly close to Pekanbaru and Rupat Island. This was in the late 1950's thru the 1960's. Grade school on Sumatra and high school in Singapore.
You?
9431 2018-09-13 03:58:21 Stopped myself from going to Marshall’s today to get a lavender essential oil to put in my defuser and I’m full of regrets now

9439 2018-09-13 03:56:30 Vegetable hair dyes are healthier. Massage your scalp regularly. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? for stopping hair loss. or somewhat related. I can't seem to spot the actual web address. Very pleasant. Very mild.

9450 2018-09-13 03:55:27 Dear Saudi Arabia, remember that dick move you pulled with oil prices to target the financial feasibility of extracting oil from the oil sands? As I recall, that kinda fucked the Canadian dollar. Can you do it again, for like a day, when my US$ transfer comes?
9451 2018-09-13 03:55:23 That’s one of the reasons we call him #SlickRick. The other is bc of amt of$ he’s taken from oil companies including out of state. He’s right with Texas big oil.
9452 2018-09-13 03:55:18 During 2014, he was frequent visitor and handling the legal operation of Reliance office in Delhi which handle the Oil & Gas operation.

9462 2018-09-13 03:54:00 That's right. Argan oil is a super oil you can use it on your hair and skin. That's why it makes the Shiny Leaf shampoo and conditioner so good. Thanks for entering @onyiakpanisi and good luck!

9472 2018-09-13 03:52:44 I've been painting here lately. Oil on canvas. It takes a hellava lot of patience to create artwork. I have a newfound respect for all the artists,  past and present. I'm learning a lot f'ing up some canvases. #TrialAndError is costly.
9473 2018-09-13 03:52:39 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Natural Aloe Vera is good for your scalp. Eat sardines for shiny hair. Is it NISIM or NHB?  Prevents hair loss. or very close to. How do I discover the right web page. Had no parabens. My hair misses it.

As for Oil prices , read up on Fiscal discipline and the debt left by CONgress govt .Lower prices will lead to high inflation which is just 3.7% right now.

9577 2018-09-13 03:38:22 That's a valid concern.  Perhaps EV's makers will come from China & Europe & we will import & purchase w/out dealership.  Also not as profitable to service EV's.  So we have big oil & big car makers coming after EV's.  Who said disruption was easy?

I eat an inordinate amount of it—primarily via an almost nightly big bowl of popcorn (or two!). I've been doing this for decades, I'm in my 40s, and I'm considered skinny.

Well, you could put some portion of it into a bottle for use, and keep the main amount in a cupboard.

In the box, light won't affect it much. 

Ultimately, meh. It's oil. If it goes rancid before you use it all, whatever.

It's in a big plastic sack, which is itself in a box, which I assume is totally normal for anyone buying way to much cooking oil.

I have bad news about the location of my sink.

9670 2018-09-13 03:26:12 It could be the espresso, it could be the stress, or maybe it’s the tingly feeling I get the night before a Direct— but whatever it is the midnight oil is being burnt all damn night.

The dollar fell 0.5% and traded lower against all of its G-10 peers. The Norwegian krone and Australian dollar were among the biggest G-10 gainers as U.S.-China relations brightened.

9696 2018-09-13 03:22:27 if the question is why aren't 'we' building TMX, the answer is that the gov't - spurred by Alberta and big oil lobbyists - broke the law. google it.

also, his central assumption - oil demand will grow - is baseless. even the fossil fuel-biased @IEA shows demand flatlining...

9702 2018-09-13 03:21:09 Is it in a can? Like a metal can? I'd say you'd be fine for a few months.

Just don't put it somewhere in the sun, or over the stove.

Smell it now. Eventually, if it starts to smell different, you will know it's bad.

How much oil did you buy? And is it Olive oil?
9703 2018-09-13 03:20:59 I got this new oil it smells so good

9705 2018-09-13 03:20:49 Interesting deviation in the discussion. Can you change your oil too often? So maybe, yes the analogy doesn’t quite hold (though it makes a great point). Maybe “if brake cable is loose changing the brake pads won’t fix it”?
9706 2018-09-13 03:20:31 I wonder how this relationship will change now that we are the #1 oil producer?
9707 2018-09-13 03:20:18 LOL for sensitive skin i would say stuff like aloe and honey and rose are good products. tea tree oil is my favorite and rly effective but would probably not work for you
9708 2018-09-13 03:20:07 @IanJamesPoulter I was looking at your website and what’s in your bag and was curious about which putter you are using.  In my bag I’m back to a Scotty Cameron Newport 2 with an Oil Can finish. I just love the feel of it when you putt.

9735 2018-09-13 03:16:31 And technically, it won't actually make you sick to eat rancid oil. It'll just taste bad.
9736 2018-09-13 03:16:26 Problem is most renewables aren't quite economically viable just yet in comparison.  

Oil is too abundant, cheap, and used in way too many consumer products  to abandon.  We are several decades away to a full renewables commitment, imo.

9742 2018-09-13 03:15:51 Normally, even when sealed up and never opened, Olive oil will go rancid after about 2 years.

Other oils will have barring shelf life, but it's generally on the order of months of stored well, i think.

9755 2018-09-13 03:14:43 This is why saturated fats, like lard, will generally last longer In storage.

Rancid oils will smell and taste kind of "rotten". 

I think if you keep the oil somewhere dark and cool, it'll probably least a few months at least before it starts to go rancid.

9763 2018-09-13 03:13:18 The reverse sear is better IMO. Same concept, less time. You need to ramp up that oil temp at end for the crust. Looks delicious regardless.
9764 2018-09-13 03:13:14 I get why some people like it but I have a very hard time liking this version of Clark Kent. Every single thing he does in the film to move the plot is reactionary, and the dude has no real arc

But to be fair, I take to Zack Snyder's sensibilities about as well oil does to water
9765 2018-09-13 03:13:08 Oils like Olive oil contain polyphenols. These break down over time, and that degradation speeds up when exposed to air, light, and heat. Also, poly unsaturated fats, due to their chemical structure, are open to bonding with "funky" things, which will give an off taste.
9766 2018-09-13 03:13:05 I was like that in the 80's. We used baby oil and iodine. We would just bake in the sun. Oh an can't forget the lemon juice for our hair!

9771 2018-09-13 03:12:20 Not much to cook. Break out the good buffalo mozzarella, a drizzle of olive oil and a nice balsamic. Salt pepper and good to go. Serve with nice loaf to dip in what's left on the plate.
9772 2018-09-13 03:12:10 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

9819 2018-09-13 03:04:57 What is the alternative? Subsidisation? Again our tax money. Cutting Cess? Oil Bond issued during UPA to be meet. VAT? State revenue will hit. Only proportionate increase base Price % can be reduced. Some them done. Others may follow.
9820 2018-09-13 03:04:43 Not that neoliberal legislators give a damn. @JerryBrownGov approved more oil drilling than Trump ever wanted to do in California, yet most think Brown is an “environmentalist.”
9821 2018-09-13 03:04:42 At the #43rdDems #Endorsements and we voted I-949 Yes, I-1631 Yes, I-1634 No (maintain local tax), I-1639 Yes, Maintain Oil Pipeline Tax (Advisory vote 19), and are counting Seattle Prop 1 (which excludes 80% of potential college students from here)
9822 2018-09-13 03:04:33 Mint!
•1 tbsp sugar 
•1 tsp honey 
•1 tsp olive oil 
• 3 drops of peppermint oil
9823 2018-09-13 03:04:23 You brave men that went and killed a bunch of guys in oil rich countries that had nothing to do with the attacks. So brave, then the campaign moved to get other unrelated countries that controlled the opiates.
9824 2018-09-13 03:04:17 I burned the back of my hand with oil making chili but if that is the price I must pay for good chili so be it
9825 2018-09-13 03:04:11 Susan Sarandon forced the DNC to overturn their decision to not accept donations from the oil and fracking industry.

9827 2018-09-13 03:03:45 And usually very good asparagus! Although you would have to ask to use olive oil instead of butter for some of them but they will do so gladly.
9828 2018-09-13 03:03:41 Baby my makeup is sweat and oil proof.. only maintaining you would need to do is your lipgloss which you should be keeping together anyway 
9829 2018-09-13 03:03:28 #IJustDontSeeMyself naked, covered in baby oil and body glitter because Mistress Buttercup has me blindfolded
9830 2018-09-13 03:02:53 There is no such thing as ethical oil.  I reject the concept outright.  The climate doesn't change any different depending on where the oil comes from.  The debate needs to shift to how fast we transition away from fossil fuels.  Tar sands is next to coal and next to go.
9831 2018-09-13 03:02:42 Strawberry Lemonade!
•1/8 tsp strawberry extract 
•3/8 tsp pure lemon extract

9834 2018-09-13 03:02:12 Remember the Seventies when they told us no more oil? It would be hilarious if the consequences hadn’t snuffed middle America.
9835 2018-09-13 03:02:10 The war overseas is really about oil but go off
9836 2018-09-13 03:01:47 Thank you, @williamfreimuth @CAVUmedia. New Mexico faces a crucial decision point tomorrow - and 2 ex-energy industry employees are going to try and transform the beautiful San Juan Basin from a vibrant multi-use public lands natural resource into an oil and gas playground.
9837 2018-09-13 03:01:45 I need at least 20 seeds and some edibles...hash oil if he gots it
9838 2018-09-13 03:01:23 I’m sure most oil companies are run by tree-hugging liberals?
9839 2018-09-13 03:01:11 We have this and I can confirm it smells nothing like any of the springs I have been to or drunk out of  It smells like that “Oceanus” diffuser oil from early 2000s Body Shop
9840 2018-09-13 03:01:10 Either commit to renewables, kick out big oil and stop the pipeline or nationalize oil and use the profits to build energy sustainability.

Buying the pipeline, whether it's built or not, is the worst case scenario
9841 2018-09-13 03:00:57 what’s everyone’s favorite essential oil? mine’s gun oil h20
9842 2018-09-13 03:00:43 And you, sir, @EconTalker, thank you for the fracking podcasts you did couple years ago, introduced me to this fascinating revolution, I’ve become totally semi-knowledgeable about oil and argue with Internet strangers now. Started w/ u.

9847 2018-09-13 03:00:23 Nope, you’re not alone. Sick of seeing and hearing that long streak of p*ss, with his oil slick drawl, spouting bovine manure and plain lies. They’ve pitched NF in favour of this charlatan. Anyone would think this shower (ERG) were in charge. Oh, wait...

9871 2018-09-13 02:58:23 Maybe it's that the climate denialists already have their apocalypse planned, and to them, ecocollapse, carbon, and where oil comes from all look like an intrusion of "scientific theory" into the territory of unquestioning belief.
9872 2018-09-13 02:58:21 After the reception, did  you go upstairs, squirt warm baby oil all over your hands and give @realDonaldTrump a foot massage? His bone spurs must have been sore as hell!

9878 2018-09-13 02:57:36 It's always at the end of summer, that flies try to invade homes. Stock up on lavender, citronella, and peppermint oil, incense, and candles to repel them. Alternately, spray the doors with lavender infused fabric softener spray, vinegar, and or any sprays mixed with the above.
9879 2018-09-13 02:57:34 The Russians have always wanted Alaska back, since they sold it, but especially since oil was discovered. There is no way that would happen.
We have a massive military presence up there, no way anyone is going to hand it over to Russia.
9880 2018-09-13 02:57:28 Except it is the exact opposite. Before Chavez the country was in very dire straits. They nationalized oil and created welfare programs that lifted people out of poverty. Then over the next decade or so we attempted multiple coups and assasinations, as well as continue heavy

9896 2018-09-13 02:54:57 I have said that since the day I went to the oil patch in 1972, we have had the oil but would not drill for it just import other than military for future use made no sense
9897 2018-09-13 02:54:54 เราขออวยพรให้สองคนมั่นคงนะ จับมือกันแน่นๆ นะ
9898 2018-09-13 02:54:52 Yep, helping to pay the salaries of everyone who was part of the design and assembly process and the workers who drilled for oil/who refined it into fuel, as well as the people who ship the fuel to the plane. Dont understand how this is hard for a liberal to comprehend.
9899 2018-09-13 02:54:47 Gasoline too cheap and readily available...Arab oil embargo of 70s had us all carpooling

9901 2018-09-13 02:54:43 Zara has the same problem, without hair product it gets frizzy and tangled and looks ratchet af. I use hair lotion with castor oil in it. It comes in a white and pink bottle from Walmart

9903 2018-09-13 02:54:29 @Taggart7 @TorrensJonathan @TAGGARTnTORRENS I entered a k hole by accident...I thought I was the gack. I woke up with my shoe soaked in engine oil and a pocket full of soda crackers.

9907 2018-09-13 02:53:58 I will never forget the horrific tragedy that was 9/11—just like I will never forget our subsequent invasion of a country that had nothing to do with it, under the pretense of nonexistent weapons of mass destruction, for the ulterior purpose of seizing control of its oil reserves

9913 2018-09-13 02:53:15 Been shaken out of a few attempts recently. Oil acting hard AF to trade. Weekly view the way to go though. Could be a good spot.
9914 2018-09-13 02:53:12 This time is different. Russian posturing economically (by claiming Ruble will bounce back at year's end, probably b/c Russia will increase oil output while US/Iran tensions create a market vacuum, bringing money into Russia), its supporting N. Korea while attacking NATO's future
9915 2018-09-13 02:53:09 加拿大都是oil sand，成本就比海里稍微便宜点。。。也挺贵的
9916 2018-09-13 02:53:07 Double cleansing itu step awal dari skin care, pertama bersihin muka pake cleansing oil / milk, trus setelah bersih,cuci muka pake facial wash, abis itu pake exfoliating toner dulu, setelah itu biar mukamu ga iritasi, pake hydrating toner, hydrating toner bisa pake air mawar
9917 2018-09-13 02:53:02 And if Canada’s government had any interest in providing for Canadians well being and economic future we could develop much larger oil reserves than America has.
9918 2018-09-13 02:52:49 Way to go!   Keep up with the oil changes.

9930 2018-09-13 02:51:04 Your property taxes are State regulated, they’re not part of Fed tax cut; gas prices are based on numerous factors: oil price on open market plus added taxes: Fed, State, County, city... I probably missing something. You need to take your grievances to local politicians
9931 2018-09-13 02:50:59 Potus45 was out tooting his tooter about his Global Climate acuity today. He rolled back mandates preventing the discharge of methane at gas at  oil & gas wells. Quite a coincidence with Putin's Arctic zone drilling policies.

their oil and the complete breakdown of their populations. Even to stealing their oil before the job complete. :)
9935 2018-09-13 02:50:14 The geologist that works for the oil company will deny climate change. The oceanographer who works on a research Grant will claim that not only is it bad but it's so bad he/she will need more $ to study how bad. Follow the money. Both are bought. Truth is in the middle

9938 2018-09-13 02:49:58 With our daughter having cancer. I see how it’s helped her as far as CBD oil. I see hallucinogens as anothe form of mind control. Only my opinion, been there done that I guess.
9939 2018-09-13 02:49:56 CBD OIL! I’m telling ya. I was HELLA skeptical. But I couldn’t get any meds to really work & I felt like all the medicine was making me crazy. So I entered a give away at Serene Leaf in Pratt & won. Now I will NEVER use anything else. I still have some bad days but I’m doin great
9940 2018-09-13 02:49:48 Ok now after doused his dumpster fire with oil he threw a couple other people on top of it.

9975 2018-09-13 02:43:42 My job at an oil company I thought I’d be there till I retired. Take it nice and easy. But you hit the nail on the head - challenges and $$ kind of trumped that. Plus the desire to feel proud of your company’s product.

9994 2018-09-13 02:41:23 The inept & obtuse handling of our economy by some of our imbecile leaders led to the high inflation & price hike in the country . The escalating hike in the oil price is pervasive enough to pull back the country’s growth to nought .......
