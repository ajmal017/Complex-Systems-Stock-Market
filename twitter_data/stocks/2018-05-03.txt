68 2018-05-03 23:05:23 Immediately buy a homeless/animal shelter And fully stock it. With the remaining money, I'd put it in stocks, and use the dividends to buy more, until the dividends are enough to support my shelter fully. Or buy another

93 2018-05-03 22:41:55 Wait.  How do you reconcile the right blaming Obama (falsely) for not taking away bump stocks but then you say Dems want to take your guns. Or saying from 2008-2010 the Obama Admin didn't get gun control done but then saying again, they want your guns.  Pick a lane.

103 2018-05-03 22:36:11 You can invest the money in stocks or even a high interest savings account. 

If stocks are successful, I would have to pay tax. 

With a savings account, after paying tax, and the inflation my loan is subjected to, I really would be no better off

107 2018-05-03 22:33:53 Hi David. I don't have a specific view on NPN. Stocks that trade on PE's of >50x don't fall into the fundamental basket for me. I've read all the reports on the massive discount but at the end of day it all depends on Tencent. But at <R2500 I may be interested.
108 2018-05-03 22:32:54 I had a co-worker mention coal was coming back while talking about my stocks. I gave him a little smile and told him the jobs weren't coming back and the were mostly automated jobs now. He gave me this "awe shucks" look. Lol

110 2018-05-03 22:32:41 The total value for BB's stock holdings is ~$10B. Biotech stocks are very hot. Many biotech funds like Perspective, RA Capital, are doing extremely well. In fact Joseph Edelman earned a spot in Forbes' The 25 Highest-Earning Hedge Fund Managers. BB is actually the exception.

118 2018-05-03 22:22:46 Give me a break. $1000 bonus. They tax that at 40%. Most people took home about $526 bucks. Now those same corporations are not giving raises. Many have had layoffs. And most passed the savings to shareholders and to buy back stocks. The rich get richer. It is not working.

133 2018-05-03 22:07:48 Thanks Bryce, the angling group BASS are insistent that the science for bass stocks is accurate and won't listen to alternatives, ironic really that one of their main players is willing to skew the results of your survey by completing it whilst not being a fisherman
134 2018-05-03 22:05:42 Very Strange time in income sector. Rising rates should tank regular stocks and income stocks. Tanking stocks should dampen rising rates. Kind of a chicken and egg world. Hard to tell which will be bigger, the egg or the chicken?

137 2018-05-03 22:04:25 This sounds like good news but then why were people trying to get rid of their stocks?

143 2018-05-03 22:00:15 This guy and everyone like him are plagues. He’s wrong over and over again, and all he does is come on CNBC and trash companies with thousands of employees hoping to manipulate a sell off. I own none of those stocks but this lizard needs to stop being put on cnbc.

150 2018-05-03 21:56:39 Yeah one of many reasons I don't invest in individual stocks (companies) is cause of so many variables that matter.  AUM is just one for robos.  Case and point, how many years was AMZN not even profitable?

158 2018-05-03 21:47:46 @jimcramer do you read anything into the after market action of stocks when the volume is 5 to 10 per cent of average daily volume.
159 2018-05-03 21:46:58 I love it - Elon first said he doesn’t give a shit about day traders. And apparently he doesn’t give a shit about analysts. Those who make their living off stocks require volatility to profit more, and Elon said we don’t need them. So nice to see someone NOT play by their rules!

168 2018-05-03 21:42:29 “I think stocks will go up another 15 to 20%, but ultimately, when the recession arrives—and it will arrive—there's going to be a very hard sell-off in equities,” said Scott Minerd of Guggenheim Securities in an interview with CNBC's Brian Sullivan on Tuesday.

173 2018-05-03 21:36:40 I always follow up with: "You have a bond with a 2% yield. Inflation averages around 3%. How much is your real rate of return?"

That typically changes most minds, but some students know people who lost everything in stocks. They believe that it'll happen to them, too.
174 2018-05-03 21:33:58 Prices are normalizing and stocks are more available
175 2018-05-03 21:33:51 "Right after we were raided by the FBI and told we were being investigated for wire fraud, we sold all our stocks and put the proceeds in new bank accounts under our wives' names, and the government is all acting like we were trying to hide the money WTF?"

181 2018-05-03 21:33:17 That’s called a bump stock. It’s a stock you put on the back of an AR-15 where it bumps against your shoulder making the firearm shoot faster. It’s not the rifle itself. I agree with you that bump stocks are not necessary except if there was a zombie invasion
182 2018-05-03 21:32:19 It wasn't the best day on Wall Street after reporting quarterly results for these #retail stocks $TUES down 7.5% to close at $3.38 $SFM down 13.3% to close at $21.15 and $SBH down 11% to close at $15.12

184 2018-05-03 21:31:18 Honestly, at this point, it’s all just theater. Trump thinks violating due process by disarming citizens before hand is okay. The NRA is okay with banning bump stocks. You support every crazy 2A violation in this state and are pushing for more!
185 2018-05-03 21:28:50 So people who went to school, got jobs, paid taxes, and contributed to society, but barely made ends meet and certainly did not have savings /stocks were not personally responsible? It is all about you.
186 2018-05-03 21:26:19 tomorrow i'd really like an on target number for #nfp. too high and it will increase the chance of increased tightening and kill stocks. too low and it will be risk-off and kill stocks. I'm positioned now for a risk rally in #FX so stocks, bonds and $vix are important here

255 2018-05-03 20:49:51 Let the stocks and market lead your thesis. So here it is. You're sitting on cash. You have to put it to work. You dont know where and so you stick a chunk in utilities because that's the default plave of rest where u can collect the dividend 1/2

257 2018-05-03 20:47:47 I don’t care if bump stocks are banned. They aren’t nearly as effective as the media makes them out to be

261 2018-05-03 20:44:43 @RoyalCaribbean your recent changes in policies is why your stocks are crashing.
262 2018-05-03 20:44:29 Yes higher risk because of fewer stocks so if one hits the skids you’re down XYZ % but with 40 you’re only down X%
263 2018-05-03 20:43:27 #LargeCap #stocks that outperform in #bullmarkets are often called “#Market leaders”, implying that other #equities get dragged along for the ride.

265 2018-05-03 20:39:54 I would have thought less hard than being up 15% ( or 18%!) with 40 stocks. The reason being your 1st pick should be better than yr 5th 2/3

270 2018-05-03 20:37:25 rackets with stocks or shares stockbrokers do not often make sure wither their gained or earned inwards are juresidictionally approved or denied .
271 2018-05-03 20:37:15 It’s not solving for that.  It’s solving for making assets much easier to move and control.  Right now it takes 2-3 weeks to move stocks between brokers - a tokenized asset can be moved in minutes.
272 2018-05-03 20:36:58 Higher risk because more concentrated? Or higher risk because of the type of stocks? Or perhaps both. Being up say 15% with 15stocks 1/2
273 2018-05-03 20:35:29 Stock buy backs were driving the recent runups in stocks. When gas prices go up, it's 2008 all over again. The 99%ers will feel the pain. Trump and guys like Hannity will swoop in and scoop up more real estate.

290 2018-05-03 20:17:43 THURSDAY CLOSING BELL:  

U.S. Stocks erased a nearly 400-point loss Thursday afternoon as tailwinds from strong earnings helped the index snap a four-day losing streak.
291 2018-05-03 20:17:29 The Boulder City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to advance a ban on the sale and possession of assault weapons, bump stocks and high-capacity magazines in the city.
292 2018-05-03 20:16:48 Looks like a leak of $ATVI earnings caused volatility in both stocks.
293 2018-05-03 20:16:47 The economy is dictated by more than stocks. Retail and restaurants are struggling in many regions.

306 2018-05-03 20:09:16 Amidst these additional cuts, a friendly reminder that Sue Thomas has take a 40k raise from what she made last year and in 2015 Truman had 500k invested in oil stocks.

309 2018-05-03 20:08:38 Checked with some stocks, seems to be responsive to the past price action. The stochastic RSI moving average drops fast as soon as the price stops advancing. This should work for short term trading.

321 2018-05-03 20:03:30 After earnings season ends, probably sooner, Stockmarket will rally as even the slightest bit of bad news has beaten down equities beyond reason. Traders looking for relative value will drive market up to 25k by end of May. #stocks #bullmarket #rallytime

379 2018-05-03 19:34:14 More than enough stocks they carry, anytime.
380 2018-05-03 19:33:40 Oh don't worry... if that's the case house & senate Republicans will just pass a bill to ban bump stocks. Have we all figured out yet that most (R)s are actually (D)s?
381 2018-05-03 19:33:24 Am I the only one who's noticed that stocks are down less than 1% from before FOMC despite the fact entire fintwit has gotten apocalyptic?

(And just because Warren Buffett can't find places to invest his growing cash hoard doesn't suggest there's a market bubble, does it?)

414 2018-05-03 19:13:17 Stocks aren't exactly my forte, but I do know that uncertainty is nooot good.

 I was trying to understand exactly the extent of information that the Dow dropped early after reading that article. Guess the full info on the earnings will drop for real after close.

417 2018-05-03 19:09:35 Possibly but those higher risk stocks should only be a smaller % of portfolio and only management execution can decide if it deserves to be a higher % problem is too many times we let our emotions decide instead

427 2018-05-03 19:07:15 #EmergingMarkets stocks, bonds, and currencies have faced headwinds recently, posting monthly losses in April.  Concerns include potential #TradeWars, uncertainty around continued global growth and the recent rally in the dollar.
428 2018-05-03 19:06:51 I use both, but playing fast moving stocks with limit orders can be pointless.
429 2018-05-03 19:06:46 Part 1 we’re penny stocks can be played in many ways. I think it’s important to know the fundamentals in anything. It will let you know if it’s worth the price. A stock at 50 vs 60 doesn’t mean the one at 60 is better.

432 2018-05-03 19:06:01 Ah but with your concentrated portfolio only one or two stocks can make all the difference.  Thankfully it’s not a race and as long as we aren’t losing it’s all good in my book
433 2018-05-03 19:06:01 Yeah, nothing he's ever done has succeeded (said with sarcasm).  Sell your stocks back, I'll take them at a discount :)
434 2018-05-03 19:05:33 Wow the microcap pot stocks are really tanking these days. Investors are getting more selective in the cannabis sector! The serious players should outperform going forward, and many of the promo stocks will disappear.

461 2018-05-03 18:56:33 Perhaps market is trying to price 3-6 months ahead at this time. The elections may result in a lot of change in the political environment and bring uncertainty. This earnings growth related to the corporate tax cuts won't sustain either and stocks already priced it in.

511 2018-05-03 18:27:07 They need to make a lot of moves. 
1. Move Bruce to 1st, Nimmo needs to play.
2. Trade for a real catcher, they’ve got Peter Alonso who’s hot right now, trade him while his stocks high. 
3. They need to move Lugo into the rotation. Move Vargas to the bullpen.

517 2018-05-03 18:23:04 Marc Faber: "Based on the recent market action of stocks around the world and in particular in the US, I am growing increasingly confident that the January 26, 2018 high at 2,872 for the S&P 500 was a major top indeed."

520 2018-05-03 18:21:36 Peak earnings & rising short rates are the culprits. Notice leading economic indicators (ISM new order, stocks) have rolled over but coincident indicators (employment, inflation) are still rising. Not good backdrop for equities (SPY), better for US long bonds (TLT).

531 2018-05-03 18:17:27 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U.

532 2018-05-03 18:16:09 -Options are great because they don’t tie up extant money, but same day sales raise your gross income. I never risked buy& hold options because I had other exposure.

-Discounted stocks mean you make the discount % iff stocks stay even, but your existing $ is tied up/risked.
533 2018-05-03 18:15:47 you pull up all stocks in that arena then once you see a stock in a certain field (such as bio) start going?
534 2018-05-03 18:15:47 @capitalmind_in in the spirit of your high price theory (which I did a Leibniz on, 3-4 years ago), how about this - buy all stocks that are about to hit centuries (like 85 going to 100, 800 going to 1000, 77,000 going to 100,000)? Indians are century lovers.

566 2018-05-03 18:03:17 the @etrade commercials basically saying ‘don’t get mad, get even’ also are bullshit because no one beats the market trading individual equities and most people should just have index funds and encouraging angry, uninformed investors to play around with stocks is irresponsible.

619 2018-05-03 17:39:12 What we actually saw was investors switching to “absolute return” strategies after the lows. Only after large gains in stocks do they want back in stocks. It may best to shift to absolute return before losses. Everyone gets what they want... if they want to avoid gains, wait...

642 2018-05-03 17:30:31 And he couldn't be more right, if individuals don't like volatility they shouldn't be in risky stocks... or individual stocks in general, go find an ETF and you'll enjoy life a lot more.
643 2018-05-03 17:29:48 Why in the fuck is there a stocks app already installed on iPhones??? What even are stocks anymore? I need more room for senseless photos of my dog ok
644 2018-05-03 17:29:28 Gold is NOT meant to be something you hold that "skyrockets" its insurance against economic folly. If you want to speculate buy mining stocks, cryptos, bio tech stocks etc
645 2018-05-03 17:29:24 How do you get into stocks and bonds I want my bank like dat 
646 2018-05-03 17:29:08 The stocks
647 2018-05-03 17:28:54 Yeah that is certainly the way it works in many cases....hence the absurdity of more indices than actual stocks

670 2018-05-03 17:16:58 Law of averages will catch up. I expect 3% cut in 2018. Current rally if fabricated one with focus on Index managemt. Stocks are selling off on account of profit booking after giving good results because valuations are stretched.

676 2018-05-03 17:14:20 The main thing that concerns me about US equity-based dividend plays is that, as you said, they are trading near ATHs.

Many of these stocks don't diverge too much from the largest indices. If we are in agreement that US equities are boasting generous valuations then what's next?
677 2018-05-03 17:13:59 Why is it that Turkey's gross external debts (currently around ~50% of GDP) excite anxiety in the EM commentariat in way that the similar or larger external debt stocks of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Chile or Uruguay do not?

710 2018-05-03 17:00:21 I think it's clear that those gain from stocks last year, helped fuel the crypto rally as investors had more free money to play with and were more risk tolerant chasing alpha. But this stock market is topping out and played out now, will be interesting to see how it unfolds

774 2018-05-03 16:31:20 Also tell Wapner to stop calling individual stocks down 20% = bear markets...

Stocks aren’t markets.
775 2018-05-03 16:31:20 Stocks aren’t cool anymore. Pogs are the new economy.

777 2018-05-03 16:31:09 Since yesterday's FOMC mtg was modest bullish for stocks on the surface, is the reason it's still a negative because - one step back - the Fed is no longer stocks-positive, so a meeting that spotlights the Fed also spotlights that, big picture, the Fed is stocks negative?
778 2018-05-03 16:31:05 Yes

780 2018-05-03 16:30:46 Probably because he's a narcissist who gives himself credit for anything that people think is good. 

Stocks aren't irrelevant. What I'm saying is stock prices have been rising for years, but their book value (price to revenue) has been flat.

790 2018-05-03 16:25:44 Stocks are selling and some technical levels are being lost. Breadth momentum is further weakening, although the speculative activity is somewhat turning bullish. Some of the growth issues are still holding Monday’s lows, but financials and industrials are selling off now. $SPX
791 2018-05-03 16:25:38 What’s good about higher prices at the following:
Gas pump
Grocery store
Restaurants
Farmers Markets

While, of course, companies are buying back stocks & not giving raises or hiring new people. 

How’s that extra $7.50 looking now?

How can you make money in this case as few stocks do this

816 2018-05-03 16:14:45 He mentioned about that all CEO's want to say but Elon said it , so was not sure if he is praising him ??? ..  yes, it is cash burning... I am not into $tsla as was never sure of the hype..
817 2018-05-03 16:13:35 okay so you have 2000 shares total. 1000 shares can be sold at $25 a piece and the other 1000 can be sold at $75 a piece. Then a change in stocks happen, the $25 shares increase to $50 and then the $75 decrease to $50. Which shares do you sell

822 2018-05-03 16:11:40 Which comment, he had a near 30min sarcastic rant about Elon.
--
I am very torn, as I like Musk, but as a company, $TSLA is a cash hungry loss making mess. If Tesla can hit 4-5k model'3 product', then he won't need to request more capital before winter.  yours... overly hopeful?

829 2018-05-03 16:08:14 Interesting that small- and mid cap equity indices ($RUT, $IWM)  have outperformed large-cap stocks ($SPY) during the recent soft patch. 

It shows that concerns are focused on global macro softness (Europe), trade and geopolitics, and not so much on the domestic fundamentals.

832 2018-05-03 16:07:19 Bloomberg's @GinaMartinAdams: the S&P breaking below the 200DMA tends to be a buy signal. It would be more ominous if stocks pushed below Feb & April lows.

856 2018-05-03 15:58:47 Market Pulse:
Market turmoil may be linked to such volatility leading to a further boost in HTF and within institutions. This is also linked to the incredible and broad retreat in stocks from the “fat finger” trading in future contracts.

891 2018-05-03 15:43:17 Grant, I’ve noticed a similarity in nearly every crypto pusher;
1. They do not have a 401K
2. No investments in stocks or bonds
3. No emergency money in a savings account
4. They all try to push certain coins to try and create a surge. 
It’s truly comical.
892 2018-05-03 15:43:10 Right..... . So because their launch sites have became eroded, they decided to end a 63 year war, release American prisoners, and their leader stepped across the DMZ for the first time in decades. Jesus. Look...around. ISIS done, JOBS, Stocks booming.NK at the table.MAGA!

898 2018-05-03 15:39:15 Leaders are hitting Relative Strength values above 90 vs the market last 6 weeks...this means they are beating 90% of stocks out there. IBD is a good resource. You find the Apples before they become Apple. This is where the $$$ is at even during a correction
899 2018-05-03 15:37:22 @jimcramer Most #stocks you have prompted after #Earnings have got hit pretty bad. I must admit, you are fantastic #contrarian indicator, almost as good as Lebenthal. Keep up the good work!

901 2018-05-03 15:34:21 Don't believe You. You are obviously readying conservative stats. The majority of wealthy/corporate America are investing in shares stocks dividends.......
902 2018-05-03 15:34:10 Sir he made investments in those 7-8 stocks.... out of profits he made from Trading. (I don't know he has insider info). Further, he chased momentum stocks IT, Pharma, Financials when they stared to run and benefited BIG time from momentum.
903 2018-05-03 15:33:40 IMO, if this sell off in stocks really gets going, or should I say WHEN, I believe commodities-especially Silver & Gold, as well as Cryptocurrencies will vault, VAULT, higher.
904 2018-05-03 15:33:30 @Varneyco real estate looking much better than stocks  especially when the globalist r trying 2 hold @realDonaldTrump and his supporters hostage 2 their whims. What a pathetic game being played by money changers these past three months, every week it's  different fake fear.
905 2018-05-03 15:33:01 If you stop black marketing and have sufficient stocks then progress rate will get doubled.

Many people trying to buy mi phone and TV but this insufficient stocks, flash sales, and black marketers making them to choose other products.

907 2018-05-03 15:32:33 why did tsla gap down on good earnings? just farming stops?

908 2018-05-03 15:32:09 Yeah lets ruin them like they did Yair & Choi.

Who cares if one loses? As the winner continues to win both stocks rise. The fight game isnt about protecting anyone its about seeing who the best is.
909 2018-05-03 15:31:45 $TSLA report was amazingly good. But remember, WS doesn't like to get its feelings hurt. We trade stocks like our politics. We vote stock prices on FEELINGS. So sell $TSLA to 250. Because you hurt Ben Kallo's feelings.

916 2018-05-03 15:28:28 I think to your question the answer is mostly: those who don’t believe in capitalism in the long term or who have a shorter time horizon or who at a moment in time are using stocks as an alternative to a zero sum game commodity. (1/2)

920 2018-05-03 15:27:07 I've been watching stocks really close over the last few months. The so-called "Tech Wreck" has not even started. We need a Tech Wreck followed by a Tech Reck, meaning, a reckoning for all of the capital that's been wasted on this industry over the last 8-10 years.
921 2018-05-03 15:26:59 Thanks. Here's a question. When you sell calls against dividend paying stocks, do you owe the dividend to the holder of your contract if your expiration happens after the ex div date?
922 2018-05-03 15:26:53 Agreed but examples of one aren’t arguments won.  Stocks are serially non autocorrelated.  Long proven. Finding that it snows in June or is a head wave in Maine in January says nothing about the future.
923 2018-05-03 15:26:49 I just find it hard to believe that stocks can catch that much traction here when it seems everytime they rally, yields rally quicker and quicker.
924 2018-05-03 15:26:48 #Apple buys its own stocks by $100bn
It has begun. Keep an eye.
925 2018-05-03 15:26:36 So, I guess we forgot about Bump Stocks?

It's a very close call.

943 2018-05-03 15:19:41 US monthly trade deficits collapsed by 8.7 bil in April. Why? Is it because of 'trade war'? Not yet. Is it because of economic slowdown? Most likely. There is a serious slow down. Stocks are indicating that. 10 year bond yield will go down, reflecting serious deepening slump.
944 2018-05-03 15:19:38 The Dow has oscillated within a 4% range for the last several weeks. Opening with a 1.5% dip is statistically irrelevant. One or two stocks can cause that.

You didn't exist in 2008, did you? Remember the 7-8% drops in one day? Those are what happens when things are really bad.

An investment advisor who bought stocks for his/her own account and then recommended them to clients at a higher price (front-running) would lose his/her license.
961 2018-05-03 15:15:34 Don't confuse people even more. We can transition to using the term 'ICO' only for the new, tokenized version of stocks, or other financial/investment contracts. 

The underlying tokens are not 1 or the other, it all depends on the contract being made, or implied in marketing.

986 2018-05-03 15:01:14 As I and so many others pointed out - it was a total scam. Not only buybacks, but many companies have used the extra cash to raise their dividends, which helps some, but 80% of the benefit goes to the very wealthy who own 80% of all stocks.

1042 2018-05-03 14:40:50 This close to switching to Crypto. ASX stocks aren't much better than Dow performance. Trying to squeeze blood out of a stone I'm finding. Not sure about others on here..

If the analysts and the financial press know it all then why did they bid up Tesla stocks to begin with???
1047 2018-05-03 14:40:01 Investors should understand that economic growth may accelerate  based on this stimulus and prepare themselves for higher interest rates. In such an environment, bank stocks may benefit over bond-like equities, such as utilities, real estate and consumer staples.

1052 2018-05-03 14:39:10 Why? Maybe the AT-4 was a bad example. My point was that they're unavailable to the public, so no one has them.

Banning accessories is slippery slope we aren't willing to start down.

Do you know who owns the company? The stockholders.

Whether they hold or sell the stock, it's "harvested by the shareholders."

1417 2018-05-03 12:18:57 $I in the end all what stocks need is cash. a good story is not enough. $I has 2 opportunities. earning money = failed or stock offering = most likely not.

1446 2018-05-03 11:57:33 Despite a friendly FED and great earnings the market continues to be under pressure and experiencing failed rallies - this is NOT a good sign.

1460 2018-05-03 11:53:05 Yeah, I know that - but I'm thinking about the number of shares owned using a relatively high priced ETF vs a basket of stocks that are likely to have an average price lower than the ETF - you would end up with more shares, ie, more volume.

1914 2018-05-03 04:49:04 Those who don't see the stocks as ownership are always gamblers
1915 2018-05-03 04:48:35 Yeah so are stocks and tax is still payable on that. Specifically real property gains are taxable at 25%.

1917 2018-05-03 04:47:53 Lets see, unemployment is the lowest in 2 decades, highest # of employed Americans EVER, black unemployment is lowest EVER, stocks are highest EVER, housing prices at 4 year high, first time in 20+ years of 3% GDP growth for 3 straight qtrs....I sleep just fine.
1918 2018-05-03 04:47:41 Lied about writing an executive order banning bump stocks.
1919 2018-05-03 04:47:10 We have become the laughing stocks of the world.  This is so f$!king embarrassing..the Darwin awards are more appropriate for this moron
1920 2018-05-03 04:46:46 Some people want bring a stock down in order to buy it. The next day they praise the stock in order to sell it. The day trading in stocks is always artificial
1921 2018-05-03 04:46:14 Ah good, another buying opportunity for gold stocks around the corner.
1922 2018-05-03 04:45:35 They are good stocks right .Any new issues?

1924 2018-05-03 04:43:49 That peak of 2007. Whenever someone says pharma sector has corrected enough, this picture comes in my mind. you dont buy leader stocks of previous bull market (pharma in this case), its a 'correction trap' always

1926 2018-05-03 04:41:42 Fake news about some stocks are being spread by some vested interests on Moneycontrol forums. So, please don't get moved by that deceit
1927 2018-05-03 04:40:51 Nice gains! But to be fair, many cannabis stocks in that time went up that much or more and your money wouldn't have been locked up either.
1928 2018-05-03 04:40:23 GST council may cut gst on cement, paint & white goods from July Sources to Cogencis: @VivekIyer72 related stocks will be in focus.
1929 2018-05-03 04:39:30 Not sure yet. Could be 93s or 95s, likely the latter after the coming low in the 10Y yield, to rise well north of 3%, which will be one of the reasons for the crash in stocks this Fall. In Gold, I'm looking for at least a ST low at 1270, below there 1245. But it could be worse.
1930 2018-05-03 04:39:04 And this is why even long term investing is extremely difficult. Risks have to be quantified upfront and not after an event happens. For eg : in aviation stocks, when stock is rising, we discuss rising passenger traffic and when the stock plummets, we discuss fuel prices, mgmt.
1931 2018-05-03 04:38:35 Can’t sleep I hear noises
1932 2018-05-03 04:38:28 Have a look at apex frozen foods, waterbase and avanti feeds. Great entry point now, good summer/monsoon stocks. Solid fundamentals as well. Expecting a good result, debt free(Avanti feeds).
1933 2018-05-03 04:37:46 Fiat Money, Gold, stocks, MFs nothing has intrinsic value. It is only belief. The government told you that the piece of paper has value so you believe it.

1939 2018-05-03 04:33:12 When I was trading stocks my portfolio was consistently up 20% a year and I thought I was killing it. Then I came to #crypto! 
1940 2018-05-03 04:32:35 What? The wall? Nope? Banning abortion? Nope. Gorsuch has nothing to do with Trump. No Muslim ban. Unemployment close to same as Obama. Stocks only up 20%, gas is $1 gallon MORE. Thousands owe more in taxes & millions have lost their jobs. So much winning.
1941 2018-05-03 04:31:55 What has changed for PBA and Patel Eng? You had given a wait period of 1 to 2 years for these two stocks.
1942 2018-05-03 04:30:58 Kudos to you bro- but sorry for the comparison, I liken crypto's to penny stocks. Keep in mind I don't know a hoot abt cryptos but the idea of them conjures up boiler-room pennies. What am I missing?
1943 2018-05-03 04:30:42 The only thing exciting about your playstyle is seeing just how many stocks you can manage to SD away.
1944 2018-05-03 04:30:21 Real estate needs to have the same high level of oversight and protection that exists for purchasing stocks bonds and mutual funds.

Buyers need to be afforded better protection with mandatory cool off periods, stricter requirements for offers, and mandatory home inspections.

1983 2018-05-03 04:04:32 USD is less volatile and therefore more useful for payments. But, yes, it's not an investment. But this isn't a discussion about USD vs. BTC. USD isn't an investment. It's not a commodity. BTC is. So it's BTC vs. stocks and other commodities. And about managing risk.
1984 2018-05-03 04:03:03 One can see an irrational stance towards company results and subsequent stock performance in the market: people continue to expect stocks that have run up 20 - 30% in recent rally to keep moving up after they come up with strong results. Wasn't the prior rally bcoz of that only?

2022 2018-05-03 03:32:03 It’s like stocks, you’re either a day trader or a long term holder. Buy shoes and sell quick for smaller profits, or buy your shoes and hold for a long time for a higher yield. I’d rather make $125 on a shoe within a week over $200 in 6 months unless I bought like 50-100 pairs.

2036 2018-05-03 03:21:35 We didn't get to do our return to stocks today because we got steamrolled
Also,
GASP 
Someone called out
(Someone always calls out)

So, from my calculations, we will have ~135 returns to do tomorrow.
A larger than should be % are 0.00 copays
2037 2018-05-03 03:20:33 Barbaric?  Really?  Let's get some perspective here.  Putting someone in stocks, branding them and holding them down when they are raped IS BARBARIC!  Shoes in the house?  Meh.

2041 2018-05-03 03:18:01 Bitcoin is not made from a thin air. Each Bitcoin requires a huge amount of energy and thousands of dollars to produce. Only Fiat money is produced out of thin air and it is used to pump the stock market. Billions of dollars are printed on a daily basis to pump stocks.
2042 2018-05-03 03:17:56 Real Estate can see deep correction about 30% as over supply is there + huge auctions of properties through banks (mortgage) . better avoid Real Estate Stocks.
2043 2018-05-03 03:17:52 Rich people don't buy penny  stocks. Why? Because they are too good
2044 2018-05-03 03:17:49 Do they want more random mass shootings? All anybody in power is saying is common sense gun control, ban bump stocks and high capacity rifles that fire rapidly. It would be almost impossible to ban and confiscate every gun in America.
2045 2018-05-03 03:15:09 That’s because “small business” doesn’t have stocks, they’re private owned.  If you look at the Fortune 500 companies all they’re doing is stock buy backs in record numbers.  They ARE NOT creating new jobs, they’re pocketing the extra money and investors are getting richer.
2046 2018-05-03 03:15:01 Paychecks aren’t going up. Businesses are buying stocks back to make themselves richer. We’re not getting more money each week.

2048 2018-05-03 03:14:45 @tomwfranck TOM, you are causing false and unneeded panic and volatility in the market through reckless reporting. A 3% T-Bill yield won’t do much to stocks unless you guys hype it. Return to fundamentals please.

2050 2018-05-03 03:13:48 I am talking about stocks here. And of course there are many ways to fool people. Momentum is one of them
2051 2018-05-03 03:13:43 The Left works in small increments so you really have to be vigilant. They know the slogan "ban all guns" does not play well so they use wording like "reasonable gun control," to push forward the agenda. Be wary of conservatives who embrace things like "just ban bump stocks."
2052 2018-05-03 03:11:58 I thought you said tech *stocks*. Now *that* I could go for.
2053 2018-05-03 03:11:37 So many other stocks with much cleaner moves and larger ranges, I’m filtering out a ton of noise too and developing my edge. Good luck!

2060 2018-05-03 03:08:01 I just have one small request. I want them all on public display in stocks before they're dispatched to the lower realms to burn in hell for eternity.

2138 2018-05-03 02:25:26 The dollar rally's is what triggered a lot of these moves, and spurred some investors to sell EM stocks/bonds.

2166 2018-05-03 02:04:39 time to invest in hard disk manufacturer stocks ;-)
2167 2018-05-03 02:04:33 I think you’re overestimating the GOP appetite for crypto. If this was stocks etc, fine. Crypto is different and, at this point, would be carved out IMO
2168 2018-05-03 02:03:33 You know your risk reward was inexistant when you scratch two options 13 days before expiration that was down over 50% yesterday with stocks that goes nowhere. #scratch

He’s been wrong about a lot more the Bitcoin.
He employed people to stay out of stocks in 2011.oops
2178 2018-05-03 01:52:21 This is why it’s important to start investing now. People always say that they are waiting to time the market. There’s no proper timing. There will always be stocks performing exceptionally well in both bull and bear markets. The time to invest is NOW.

2190 2018-05-03 01:41:20 Any article I would provide would be considered "fake news." This is how I judge: my MAGA father and brother and various other family and friends have stopped hooting about @SpeakerRyan 's baby and Trump since the deficit went up, their stocks dived and they've seen no $.
2191 2018-05-03 01:41:02 The limitations of time... I  actively trade the futures markets primarily: ES, CL, GC, and a little 6B, 6E. Along with a few blue chip US stocks. FB, MSFT etc. The Chronicles take a couple of hours, the tweets 10-15m :-)
2192 2018-05-03 01:39:03 I tried crypto currencies & stocks, & just can’t get wit it
2193 2018-05-03 01:36:18 Since I’ve recently picked an interest in stock it would be nice if the people who tried to talk to me would just surprise me with stocks instead of just aimlessly talking to me 
2194 2018-05-03 01:32:00 Beginning to think about bonds, stocks and investing in your employer’s provided retirement plan are key to making smart investments.
2195 2018-05-03 01:31:48 A convicted domestic abuser (felony or misdemeanor) is prohibited by federal law from buying or possessing a firearm.  Will another law make them stop their illegal behavior?
Sounds like the states need to step up their enforcement of another federal law.
Bump stocks.... meh

2198 2018-05-03 01:24:04 He filled the WH with swamp creatures. He’s done nothing for the middle class, he’s killing our environment, insurance premiums rising, gas prices rising, deficit soaring, stocks declining, companies closing, corp welfare highest ever and still waiting infrastructure plan.
2199 2018-05-03 01:23:13 Let's see...the economy is booming, the stock market is breaking highs, massive tax reform was passed in about a year, unemployment is at about 4%, ISIS isn't as active as they were a year ago, we're attempting peace with North Korea, bump stocks were banned...how is that a joke?
2200 2018-05-03 01:22:40 The Jensen and Dylon Joint co. We do stocks. We also make joints.
2201 2018-05-03 01:22:00 There are still states where domestic abusers may own a weapon.

People are allowed to own weapons despite mentally ill people living with them.

Bump stocks are still legal in many states.
2202 2018-05-03 01:21:44 Trump tax cut is not working.  Companies pay more dividend and buying back their stocks instead of hiring... 
Apple spent $22.8 billion buying back its own stock in the first three months of this year and announced plans for further $100 billion worth of share buybacks.
2203 2018-05-03 01:21:13 No actually the Constitution refers to a "well regulated" (notice the word regulated?) militia (which at the time used *muzzel loading* rifles, not ARs with bump stocks). Bye troll.

2226 2018-05-03 01:03:39 I just invested in stocks let’s see
2227 2018-05-03 01:03:09 I agree with your original statement. One size does NOT fit all. Low price high volume stocks may benefit from sub penny while Berkshire May benefit from $100 ticks. Clearly sub penny ticks in less liquid high value stocks would just facilitate gaming and be bad.
2228 2018-05-03 01:01:18 Yes so you’ve convinced me hodling money is speculation, but so is trading stocks. 

I guess a distinction can be made between trading stocks (stock market) and a company raising capital through share issuance. One is speculation, one is putting capital to work. Amirite?
2229 2018-05-03 01:01:14 Its not an easy clean environment for longs, but it is still worth tracking a list of stocks holding up well. Covered some earlier in video

2248 2018-05-03 00:48:37 Or for that matter any other stocks.

But is he bold or arrogant?
2249 2018-05-03 00:48:32 You don't know about capital mkt trading activities by Karti C when PC was union FM in UPA govt. Karti will face investigation on insider trading too.

2250 2018-05-03 00:48:23 No "direct" stocks, But short options? Or Mutual funds/bonds in relevant industry competing against Tesla? (Sorry to ask the way you ask E. Musk)
2251 2018-05-03 00:47:37 I’ve found many retail investors in Asia still don’t think of stocks as a place to accumulate long-term wealth. I’ve been trying to raise that level of education, but expect it will take a decade or two for participation to reach US levels
2252 2018-05-03 00:46:59 So ur resisting a great economy, Higher wages, peace with North Korea , American prisoners being freed! Tax decreases, people getting bonuses, stocks, better health Benefits, college tuition paid for, etc lol that’s just dumb
2253 2018-05-03 00:46:38 Can I ask the reason behind your comment? He has explained multiple times the reasons FAT has fallen. Lots of stocks have. Not sure the purpose in saying this?
2254 2018-05-03 00:46:30 In some Asian countries the CEO’s pride is so entrenched within his company’s performance that were such a shocking security breach to occur, the CEO would resign immediately & some even commit suicide. Not advocating that but time in the public stocks for CBA would be wonderful
2255 2018-05-03 00:45:04 I can’t stop checking my stocks aghhh what have I become!
2256 2018-05-03 00:44:44 Are you referring to commodities/stocks or something else entirely?
2257 2018-05-03 00:44:33 Or tax scam? Maybe trade war? See how stocks are dropping and prices for gas going sky high? Last time it happened right before recession. Republicans crash economy and democrats have to put it back on track.

2298 2018-05-03 00:11:43 That sounds refreshing. If you follow the PEOPLE not the MONEY....Do you have disclaimer of owning any stocks in the auto or relevant industry (or short/long option) like other writers/analysts?

2301 2018-05-03 00:09:04 ok invest in broad stocks that have longevity first before delving into risk stocks
2302 2018-05-03 00:07:18 @BluegrassCap Visa Europe was an absolute steal for $V and along with $MA will continue on printing money for years as more people and businesses go cashless. Stocks should be great for the foreseeable future #investing #trading #TomsTruths
2303 2018-05-03 00:07:15 Yup. After all this years, I can't still trade thin stocks , forget mentioning them on twtr!
2304 2018-05-03 00:07:06 I agree. Also stocks. No one should own things, fuck them if they want to create a market on goods.
2305 2018-05-03 00:06:16 How are the NYT’s stocks doing over the last 5 years?
2306 2018-05-03 00:05:59 70-100 innings, the vast majority of which will be high leverage and pitched at 100% effort, are likely better than 160 innings of 80% effort, many of which are not high leverage.

2309 2018-05-03 00:02:53 That’s BS I just read the deficit comparisons and at this time during Obama’s first term obama was twice as high. Name the stocks, mine are doing great! How are trade wars hurting farmers, they don’t have to compete with Mexico. Besides deficit is based on interest due overall
2310 2018-05-03 00:02:25 $SPY If you continually watching (getting caught up in) every move on the indexes, you're going to have a hard time holding GOOD stocks!
2311 2018-05-03 00:02:08 Haha, I own stocks.  Was more a commentary on the way it was sold to the public
2312 2018-05-03 00:01:59 I short my stocks sometimes...
2313 2018-05-03 00:01:10 Nobody cares about Main Street. Get with the program and just buy stocks.
2314 2018-05-03 00:00:34 @GeoMiner $SPY As I've often posted, I'm mostly focused on swing trading individual stocks. Some you can hold for a longer time. Example $LX
2315 2018-05-03 00:00:29 Have you seriously examined yourself? You create division, name call, label and use BS data. The economy is soaring higher than it has in 20 years. I personally day traded stocks and made over $40 Dec-March. Ask someone about their 401k...you really don't have facts.
2316 2018-05-03 00:00:28 I hate the semantics people play with a bump stocks.  The left is essentially right in their assertions . It's designed to emulate a fully automatic weapon . The only reason it's legal is because technically it's still only a single round per depress of the trigger.
2317 2018-05-03 00:00:13 Plan on havin some savings bond put up and some stocks purchased by the end of the year
