0 2019-01-11 23:59:42 trading stocks similar to as done before, but remember that pricing will decay if underlying stock doesn't move. Feel free to DM me if this doesn't help. More characters to type with in DM
1 2019-01-11 23:58:49 2. The S&P 500 index is calculated by taking the sum of the adjusted market capitalization of all S&P 500 stocks and then dividing it with an index divisor. 

While all markets are manipulated, there’s been multiple articles I’ve read on how the alt market cap is entirely wrong.
2 2019-01-11 23:57:32 1. Market cap is not the sum of all tradeable assets. It’s the sum of total dollar market with outstanding stocks (coins). While it is an index like $SPX, there’s major differences. 
Stocks have buy backs but only in #crypto are there “burns” that inflate market caps.
3 2019-01-11 23:56:02 Weed stocks have been absolute beatuies
4 2019-01-11 23:55:49 yes let them underestimate us and they will pay with their stocks
5 2019-01-11 23:55:41 also if you were an investor won't you be reprehensive during such periods? unstable geopolitical scene = stocks plummeting! so its a normal occurrence throughout the hate filled history of man! try to be objective eh and not sheepishly engage in argumentum adhominem! jana!
6 2019-01-11 23:54:33 If any of you want another play similar to $NTNX but different (same same but different... James Franco voice) then check out $PSTG. Full disclosure I own all stocks I’ve mentioned and will be buying $PSTG back on 1/21/19.
7 2019-01-11 23:50:53 ..........

Stocks are hard.
8 2019-01-11 23:49:20 I still think some Chinese stocks will go down further but I believe a significant yuan devaluation will be the next development to unfold.
9 2019-01-11 23:49:08 Strong December employment data suggests the US economy is chugging along, encouraging investors to look past weak manufacturing activity and buy up US stocks in anticipation of strong profits ahead
10 2019-01-11 23:48:11 Because it is much less directional than stocks.
11 2019-01-11 23:47:05 Put him in stocks in the market square
12 2019-01-11 23:46:58 Never understood the reason some ppl feel the need to complain that CEO’s make to much $. 1 It’s a company not the government so it’s not ur $ they are using. 2. Most CEO’s actually make an appropriate salary for the job. The rest and ussualy largest section of pay is from stocks
13 2019-01-11 23:46:40 @AOC should be OK, even w/ t occasional error, as long as she unwaveringly pursues the best interests of the people and of her constituents, and doesn’t sell out, or start buying stocks on wallstreet that have advantages bc of congressional legislation, like t other senators do.
14 2019-01-11 23:45:36 It would make sense that an equity Fund Manager making a return to the game, from a long hiatus, would say stocks are going higher.  Wouldn't help his case to say the opposite.
15 2019-01-11 23:44:47 C’est le principe du congélateur tombeau... grande capacité, mais gestion des stocks plus difficile.

18 2019-01-11 23:42:42 Yes. If we zoom out, Chinese stocks are actually down almost -60% from the 2007 peak and have underperformed for 11 years.

Is that bullish or a bearish for you going forward from here on?
19 2019-01-12 23:59:52 The old scoundrel keeps pretending he's got stocks of trust and credibility to pompously appeal to, when he pissed that all away years ago.
20 2019-01-12 23:59:26 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
21 2019-01-12 23:59:23 I can’t believe we played all of Smash 4 with 2 stocks...wtf were we thinking?
22 2019-01-12 23:58:42 Yeah, where are the stocks?!
23 2019-01-12 23:58:02 The problem with #currency is the government can print it faster than you can save it! Don’t believe it? Look at the current US government’s deficits and debt level and tell me how the USD fiat currency is going to maintain purchasing power? #investing #gold #stocks
24 2019-01-12 23:58:01 Mmm #shorting @Activision at the minute given their split with @bungie. Was expecting their shares to drop some more tbh. #stocks #gamestocks
25 2019-01-12 23:57:37 When the 2nd Amendment was written there weren't any bump stocks and assault rifles.  The 2A didn't change with the times.

28 2019-01-12 23:56:30 I’m sure after windrush and grenfell the chap should invite her for tea and biscuits. Lots of deaths in this country of late have been of the preventable kind but hey ho an of the cuff remark. What do you suggest ? Birch or the stocks ?
29 2019-01-12 23:56:00 Gundlach (again): "Now we're in a bear market, which isn’t defined by me as stocks down 20%. It's determined by the way stocks r acting"

"So now this is a lime, which isn't defined by me as a green, citrus fruit. A lime is determined by me, based on how a given food is acting."
30 2019-01-12 23:54:47 World demand--importer stocks & how demand responds to old crop/new crop inverse--is biggest question for next 6 months
31 2019-01-12 23:54:22 The past week has seen an uptick in tech stocks. Could this be a sign of increased confidence in the sector, or is this just typical market behaviour the early part of the calendar year? There are many tech trends to be excited about in 2019.
32 2019-01-12 23:51:13 Trump has been already damaging this country. He has no clue of constitutional law & could care less. He's been eroding our democracy for basically "Trump Law". And some ppl agree with murderers & rapists coming over the border. These ppl just want their guns w/bump stocks, etc
33 2019-01-12 23:50:50 Thanks for the information. Doesn't the aforementioned work mostly use U.S. stocks? Has AA and/or Stambaugh looked at the out-of-sample data using futures markets and options as well as time-series implementations (vol targeting)?
34 2019-01-12 23:47:52 Stocks were one of the most effective means to shame and prevent recidivism in the medieval periods...miss those days
35 2019-01-12 23:43:29 Guess someone just bought stocks in a construction company.
36 2019-01-12 23:40:21 Most money I have ever made in my life,  

My stocks are killing it.

37 2019-01-12 23:39:44 You build a wall, and stocks in Home Depot Mexico go up overnight, mostly due to ladder sales.
