@CommSec can you also start to use .AX when you report on ASX stocks on twitter?

Thanks.

10 2018-05-08 23:45:55 Are the pure stocks running time trials or drawing for position
11 2018-05-08 23:45:31 Javi you do realize I don’t understand like 60 percent of things that happen is smash right. You shouldn’t lose stocks to me.

14 2018-05-08 23:43:58 As Martin Armstrong always say, the bubble is in the bond market. Not in the stock market. Being bearish long term on the stocks will land one in the poor house. The money needs to park somewhere coming out of the bond market and it's stawks. SNB bot som much AAPL. That's an eg

41 2018-05-08 23:38:00 I have a couple of very small stocks that I keep just for fun.  Every month while @BarackObama was POTUS they went up.  Now with Trump they have fallen considerably.  It’s just heartbreaking knowing some people live off their 401Ks.
42 2018-05-08 23:36:42 should gone with “no stocks used”
43 2018-05-08 23:36:38 @PatrickWalker56  Any ideas on the US dollar strngth? Expecting some selling soon? also the biotech stocks esp $IBB weak. Expecting more serious selling or will 100 hold.

58 2018-05-08 23:21:35 Quantitative Easing fuels freshly printed money into the economy via robots running programs on Wall St. to boost stocks. Universal Basic Income (UBI) fuels freshly printed money into the economy via humans running households on Main St. to boost living standards.
59 2018-05-08 23:19:51 We still haven't truly recovered from the last one but no one talks about this because of fixation on stocks, GDPs, home prices.

67 2018-05-08 23:12:25 Let’s not buy anything b/c evil corporations will get rich. Also let’s never trade stocks or put money in a bank account. The financial industry has huge bonuses and is corrupt. 

While we’re at it, let’s only buy the most expensive organic foods, b/c everyone can afford it.
68 2018-05-08 23:11:02 In Crypto the best thing is to narrow your focus on quality. Lots of shitty stocks and lots of shitty Crypto. The past haunts Crypto because if you look, most Cryptos traded in a flatline manner which isn’t good. Most was trash and was pumped last year.
69 2018-05-08 23:10:37 Don't invest in penny stocks selling a story and stock.  Rather, invest in microcaps with a real business and profits.

74 2018-05-08 23:09:13 It's not that the #IranDeal obama signed was good or bad..it's why @realDonaldTrump is backing out of it: defense stocks soar & war hawks get to play chicken with #iran poss lead us to war..

87 2018-05-08 22:58:18 Warren Buffett is 87 years old. He ain’t gonna change his views. He also thought that there internet thingy wouldn’t take off! He struggled during the .com bubble! He got Amazon and Google completely wrong. He doesn’t invest in Tech stocks, why? He doesn’t understand them.
88 2018-05-08 22:57:09 Some scammer making money by shorting stocks
89 2018-05-08 22:56:27 The stronger stocks will survive and the weaker ones will be bought out or die
90 2018-05-08 22:55:50 Mark very much enjoy your tweets. Want to ask you what is your opinion on Warren Buffet's approach to investing in stocks? Do you have a % of your portfolio that you invest long term like Warren? Thanks@

92 2018-05-08 22:54:15 Plus the large cap stocks, patterns are easier to spot as they develop
93 2018-05-08 22:54:10 But if you start with 50 over 100m screen and only select stocks with yield of 2.6% or higher, it has outperformed benchmark by quite a bit.

99 2018-05-08 22:52:51 for you guys bullish technology stocks along with our team, seeing the leader of the group, software, go out at new all-time highs today is encouraging for that entire sector, and the market for that matter $PSJ $SPY

101 2018-05-08 22:50:13 Your making a mountain out of a mole hill. Tell me who has the most chemical weapons stocks in the world. That's right the USA, so if your so against them why do you stock them?
102 2018-05-08 22:50:04 I don’t short stocks.
103 2018-05-08 22:49:41 Yeah, would be if aka Alex Awan.  Wonder how much of a piece of the satellite technology & nuke technology & interests in current & yet-to-be military assets (as in stocks) the ppl responsible for delaying, deferring & otherwise obstructing investigation/prosecution own?
104 2018-05-08 22:49:03 Stocks are a joke
105 2018-05-08 22:48:49 Cayendo un 10% en el after   esperemos que cuando cotice mañana corrija al alza . Muchos valores este trimestre ante buenos resultados han caído pero recuperan pronto
106 2018-05-08 22:48:38 It literally doesn't & will never work this way. To have a "minor league system" you have to have the stick/ball franchise system, which we literally do not have. There is no path to this unless those cup teams start fielding street stocks at Hickory or such.
107 2018-05-08 22:47:44 Didn't think it was April fools day again. We will accept some tea bags in exchange as stocks are low

114 2018-05-08 22:43:38 I wonder how many of trumps cronies bought oil related stocks going back to yesterday or previous days.
115 2018-05-08 22:43:21 I can't find any shorts I'm my size because all you pink belly pork eaters have the stocks filled with 40/40 jeans
116 2018-05-08 22:42:49 Trump doesn’t run the country. When two-thirds of all shares of stocks in companies are owned by 1% of all shareholders, the President, regardless of who he or she is, remains a servant to the 1%. 90% of all wealth is owned by less than 1% of the people. Can’t give Trump credit.
117 2018-05-08 22:42:29 Privé by BBH will have unlimited stocks. So itutuloy ko yung iponing ko. Huwag na muna yung concert tix ng exoplanet 5 kahit may ipon hindi naman ako nakakapunta huhuhu sad
118 2018-05-08 22:42:19 Today I took my first risk and bought stocks my next step is to open a business
119 2018-05-08 22:41:36 He’s right about taking market share from gold but only to a point.  If bitcoin is the new gold&insurance for fiat collapse, what do you buy as insurance against bitcoin failing? Methinks Gold.  I think bitcoin takes good chunk of bonds and stocks too.
120 2018-05-08 22:41:17 hmmmm....i don’t think the other tech stocks are trading at less than 12 x EBITDA

125 2018-05-08 22:40:09 so Privé by BBH will have unlimited stocks? yet i don't have a chance to buy one tho, coz it's so expensive ㅠㅠ

129 2018-05-08 22:36:45 Imagine how much more popular your TAX PORK BILL would be if all American taxpayers were included by the K STREET LOBBYISTS photographed sneaking into your Senate office. Many of the Corps. you brag about are buying back stocks and not giving raises or bonuses. SAD! Just lies!
130 2018-05-08 22:36:16 “unlimited stocks”

131 2018-05-08 22:35:16 Yay, gas is going to sky rocket, and the stocks are going to drop. But at least you keep undoing everything @BarackObama has helped build. @realDonaldTrump
132 2018-05-08 22:34:58 $BLNK not a single trade on this name today. That's a win. I didn't sleep well last night and only got two hours of sleep so I didn't have the energy to handle such a stock. Yes. You need rest to handle wild stocks like this. If you don't get sleep you're more prone to mistakes.
133 2018-05-08 22:34:22 Yes Privè has unlimited stocks!!!
134 2018-05-08 22:34:07 Because they're not sitting on fossil fuel or weapons manufacturing stocks at the moment. They'll get over it.

138 2018-05-08 22:31:06 I'd agree with all of your statements on guns. I would go a bit further and eliminate bump stocks and rifles primarily used for shooting people, but we're on the same page, if not verse. The NRA is absolutely against all of this, and that's where I have disagreement.
139 2018-05-08 22:30:35 Should add, we all contribute to guild stocks as best we can, some more some less. And we're very generous with handing out supplies from the bank. We have built a lovely little community, we treat them well and they respond in kind. Drama is rare.

141 2018-05-08 22:30:08 Stocks hold steady as Trump exits Iran deal, reinstates sanctions;  "MARKET ALERT: Stocks, oil fall after Trump says US will withdraw from Iran nuclear deal". "hold steady" or "fall"?! Make up your mind FOX!!
142 2018-05-08 22:30:04 Buy defense stocks. One-eyed Moloch is saddling up. Expect a special performance by the Four Horsemen.
143 2018-05-08 22:29:21 Remember how leaving the Iran Deal would crush markets and send oil higher? Well, oil fell $2 and stocks were flat. So...
144 2018-05-08 22:29:14 This just seems to be a smoke screen, so the bombings in Yemen still go on with more veracious times ahead and Israel laughing all the way to the back with stocks & shares of US military firms going through the roof

166 2018-05-08 22:13:44 I just think we have not seen the top of the markets, probably not for the large cap stocks. If I miss a top, so be it. I am managing risk, rather than taking a speculative directional (short) position anyway...

184 2018-05-08 21:58:19 This is very exciting if you love Nuclear War. Finally the Military Industrial Complex gets carte blanche. If you don't have military stocks, it is time to buy them. Saudis and Israelis open up those bottles of Champagne.  Oil Industry? Look for oil prices to scream.

186 2018-05-08 21:55:06 Keep telling yourself that clueless libtard. You're right though, once the criminals find out bump stocks are banned, they totally won't use them. The same as drug dealers who won't sell crack because drugs are illegal. Makes total sense.

230 2018-05-08 21:33:16 Watch the #StockMarket today! #POTUS withdrawing from the #IranNukeDeal probably caused stocks to react negatively. In addition, watch #oilprices sky rocket.

236 2018-05-08 21:31:09 And we’re back to speculation vs investment. It also hinges on the unique traits of very high leverage with real estate. No one does 65% LTV on their stock portfolio and then buys stocks they plan to lose $ on (reverse dividend?) to save tax. Becuz...dumb.

293 2018-05-08 20:58:22 The high number of deaths and majority of deaths were from AR 15’s and guns with bump stocks. Look at how many people were killed per incident.
294 2018-05-08 20:58:15 La dernière fois t’étais contente pour 3 maintenant sa en veux 6 alors que les stocks se réduise
295 2018-05-08 20:56:54 Neil maybe you need to sell those oil stocks you have bought into companies with contracts in Iran as you continue want this " deal " to stay so your pockets can get full.
296 2018-05-08 20:56:19 All my sources are reliable trustworthy, award winning newspapers with integrity for decades. Sensible gun laws and more Gun control needed NOW! BAN ALL AR15’s and the like BAN ALL BUMP STOCKS. ALL GUN SALES SHOULD REQUIRE WAITING PERIODS & BACKGROUND CHECKS.
297 2018-05-08 20:56:11 There we have the truth! Neither of us reall know enough about it to talk with any degree of authority. So I'll just stick to supporting the UK fishermen, letting DEFRA manage stocks; and you won't.
298 2018-05-08 20:55:55 I feel like a lot of filmmakers have their aesthetic tied to a specific photographic look. Manhunt, Maps to the Stars, Passion, etc all look extremely cheap to me. They all let you know their directors can no longer command the budgets & film stocks they once did
299 2018-05-08 20:55:34 Democrats don’t want to take away all guns. That’s pure bullshit. We want stricter, enforced laws for gun ownership & purchases. Many want stricter training. And we do want to get rid of AR15s or limit access, and no bump stocks. Many of us are licensed gun owners, too.

507 2018-05-08 19:31:48 It may sound funny, but LT or ST is decided by the stocks' momentum. If momentum looses in short term it is ST and so on. Once a stock becomes LT its ur Gem, preserve it. How do u know it? Use CCI 34 W <100 for exits.
508 2018-05-08 19:31:31 But what does that mean? Does that give Israel carte blanch to attack Iran’s “weapons stocks”.  Last time someone went after WMD, turns out they weren’t there.

510 2018-05-08 19:30:56 A bit odd that enthusiasts for the privatisation and marketisation of higher education also advocate the disinvestment of USS from the corporate stocks and shares of global capitalism and a nationalisation of the fund via a shift into government-issued gilts.
511 2018-05-08 19:30:40 I try not to be prejudiced. But most stocks are owned by a small fraction of the population. They could easily afford to pony up for universal healthcare, preschool for all, a National pension, and subsidize college. Look at the latest Bezos story for an example.

519 2018-05-08 19:25:04 Many novice real estate investors soon quit the profession and invest in a well-diversified portfolio of bonds. That's because, when you invest in real estate, you often see a side of humanity that stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and saving money shelter you from.

525 2018-05-08 19:22:46 Agree. I guess all stocks that are moving these days are "chatroom pumps".

527 2018-05-08 19:22:20 Here's a platform that would shake up the New York AG race: devoting 100% of the role's time and resources to putting Chris Cillizza in the stocks in Times Square.
528 2018-05-08 19:22:12 Invest in Boeing, Northrup Grumman, Raytheon etc as stocks are up
529 2018-05-08 19:22:11 It's also not unusual. The big 4 - wheat, rice, corn, soy - average between 20-30% carryover (ending stocks divided by the most recent yr's use).
530 2018-05-08 19:21:54 Pfffft!  Buffett has a mediocre track record in Tech stocks. This is called “pumping your book”.  Usually better to take the other side or avoid altogether...and you know this, @jimcramer
531 2018-05-08 19:20:44 Stocks are embracing Trump speech. Patriotic duty. Stocks will most likely close positively. Dollar strong.

538 2018-05-08 19:18:40 The propping up of bonds is now pushing cash back into stocks, again exactly like I said would happen yesterday as stocks are now well off their lows. This market is so IN OUR FACE rigged it is beyond belief laughable.

555 2018-05-08 19:12:16 The Iran Deal was an international deal, and the EU knosw that Iran has kept it's side of the bargain and will stay in the deal. Oil stocks soared on hearing the news. A rerun of Republicans in power fucking up the Middle East and cashing in on oil stocks.
556 2018-05-08 19:11:40 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
557 2018-05-08 19:11:00 Sure looks like today was a good ol' fashion shake out by the big boys to grab panicking oil and gas stocks this morning. What a bounce off those panic lows. 
558 2018-05-08 19:10:56 Defense stocks too.
559 2018-05-08 19:10:39 I think it’s about investing in what you know. People feel they understand it better than stocks or anything else.

563 2018-05-08 19:08:46 Dow declines as Trump exits Iran deal

564 2018-05-08 19:08:31 In the 80s and before people were surprised when the poor and middle class owned stocks so I feel that cryptocurrency owners will be the future rich because of economic foresight regardless of profession.
565 2018-05-08 19:08:24 Now what do we do with Iran. We are isolated and the value of our opinions have plumeted. The hatred of everything Obama did is going to ruin any chance that President Trump has to get anything done.

581 2018-05-08 19:03:16 And there goes the DOW. Stocks gonna drop, gasoline going to skyrocket.  America gonna pay a tarif for this idiotic liar and his obsession with destroying the country in higher gas prices.  Which will fuck with auto sales.  Which will fuck with my job. I hate you, Trump.

666 2018-05-08 18:35:36 I wish I was just getting into stocks now.... instead of last November  I set an alert on each of the stock I’m in for when they come back up to where I bought in. Not looking at them till I get an alert 
667 2018-05-08 18:35:11 Weird day for the stock market, naturally -- stocks rallied earlier, have managed to keep losses limited, now falling a bit again, but energy shares having the outsized effect here. #OOTT #OPEC
#Iran

A bit of "sell the news" going on, though, at least w energy shares.
668 2018-05-08 18:35:11 My Take:  Speech on #IranDeal 

- Not restrictive enough as is
- Opens door to renegotiating
- Honors Iranian people 
- Mentions cooperation w/#Europe 
- Pivots to peace w/#NorthKorea 

Oil -$1.70 
Stocks -0.3%
Dollar +0.3%
669 2018-05-08 18:35:07 Lol again?! You wrote about $sq, $w, $nvda and all of these stocks skyrocketed.  Poor people who follow your "alerts"

671 2018-05-08 18:32:32 Of course, as quickly as I state Stocks begin trading in positive territory, then they quickly reversed back into negative territory; while MBS is now down 12bps.  There may be a "flight to safety" pattern here for investors!

684 2018-05-08 18:29:06 Ok deal done, stocks move higher. Truth is Iran sucks anyways and the #IranDeal was crappy and ended in 7 years. But Trump wont follow any political norm. Now Iran rushes to build a weapon of mass destruction.
685 2018-05-08 18:28:45 The fireworks in the market happened today well before President Trump made #IranDeal announcement...now that it's done, it's being digested relatively well, with oil prices steady & stocks pretty flat

716 2018-05-08 18:18:40 Yes it is. Obviously understand the need for rules, but he's 6'7" and his knee is coming out of the cradle on the 37's. Nobody stocks the size so it's not like he can just go try Bauer, Vaughan etc...meanwhile off-season clock is ticking and he can't order his gear.
717 2018-05-08 18:17:58 I'd be happy with that. Have averaged up from 22p and think there is legs back to where the seller crashed it. I use both the 200 EMA and MA as some stocks have support/resistance at one and not the other; using both helps me to catch them!

792 2018-05-08 17:37:50 Can you show us a statistics of #Trump not helping & making the country worse?!.. from my understanding he's done a bunch of good... no trump humper but a lot has changed in many ways. stocks, jobs, income, taxes, I'm open for what you're stating?...
793 2018-05-08 17:37:42 Pension managers make the decisions what stocks to buy and sell, not governments. #redherring
794 2018-05-08 17:36:14 Politics, only interests, no friendship. Interest = friendship, both, if overlap, is the best. Buying stocks is like buying hope. Life is about preparation; so, ready to go, make a decisive breakthrough.

796 2018-05-08 17:35:23 Take out some time and do some research! If you look at past 4-5 years chart cycle you will know that avanti feeds and waterbase are monsoon stocks. Every year post monsoon (june/july/aug/sep/oct) these generally does a 2-3x. Predicting 500-600 for waterbase this year!
797 2018-05-08 17:34:27 Simple-personally, do you invest all your money in oil stocks? Assuming “no” because that would be high risk.  That is what our economy is-high risk, volatile.  Like a good portfolio-we need diversification-it’s really that simple. #ableg #LakeOfFireParty #ABPoli #neverkenney

800 2018-05-08 17:33:52 In The Market: Earlier this year, we've noted how #utility #stocks quickly became underperformers as interest rates rise. Today is more of the same. $DJU (Dow Jones utility average) sinks 2%; at 686, it's now down 5.1% YTD. $D hits new multiyear low. $PCG undercuts 50-day MA

803 2018-05-08 17:32:28 Good advice.  Save/Invest 50-75% of your income for retirement.  More people should heed this advice.  Nothing feels better than cash in the bank and stocks in your portfolio as age wages closer and closer.
804 2018-05-08 17:32:17 Oil #stocks have still not caught up to the increase in oil prices which creates a buying opportunity for investors. #oil sentiment has been so bad for so long that any increase in oil brings a slow increase in stock price but any oil price decrease causes a stock price plummet

833 2018-05-08 17:23:02 Most of my stocks went into a buy yesterday, but the Dow wasn't in a buy yet. I waited until today to see what was going to happen. The Dow turned back down this morning pulling the stocks down. I'm sitting here on the sideline just waiting and watching for some kind of signal.
834 2018-05-08 17:22:49 Expect stocks to again fall, allies namely GB and France to mistrust us, NK to have doubts about looming talks, Iran to resume nuclear threat, and for what?  All because this hateful, spiteful, “I know best” idiot wants to undo yet another Obama program. Even Pompeo favors it.

869 2018-05-08 17:08:31 It’s all in the assumptions. Understand what your assumptions are and more importantly make sure the client understands and agrees with them. It’s designed to be a moving piece and will change. The key is to revisit regularly to make sure it remains relevant and not fantasy.

916 2018-05-08 16:52:07 UNLIMITED STOCKS YALL (pero ala ako pera so....:)
917 2018-05-08 16:52:00 Sure. And big corporate tax cuts trickled down in every company to every employee. Except it didn’t. They bought back stocks, closed stores and rewarded CEO’s.
918 2018-05-08 16:51:09 I love having friends I can talk finance, stocks, and other sources of income with... I can talk about that all day!
919 2018-05-08 16:50:51 Please produce unlimited stocks after the date of release. :'( Many of us have already a thought that Privé by BBH might be sold out as of july. So please. Huhuhu. And by the way, thank you so much! @privenyofficial
920 2018-05-08 16:50:39 Buy stocks in oil? This seems like another CON from @realDonaldTrump to help his rich buddies and himself. #twump probably just told his broker to buy low, sell high. #FakePresidentREALCONMAN
921 2018-05-08 16:50:35 Prolly stocks / bonds and low risk medium return stuff.  I would go to a firm for help cause I have no idea how to do that stuff tho.

I already have the project I want to be doing *waves hands around at all his nonsense*
922 2018-05-08 16:50:24 unlimited stocks โอเคคคคเบาใจละ
923 2018-05-08 16:50:21 That must mean I’m down on oil stocks again.  Lol
924 2018-05-08 16:49:17 ชอบตรงคำว่า 'UNLIMITED STOCKS' สรุปคือสินค้ามีเพียงพอกับความต้องการแน่ๆ!?! โอเคค่าาาา เตรียมตัว คุณพูดเองนะว่า Unlimited อะ

927 2018-05-08 16:47:39 Saving is hard. 
Me: Want to save money for when the stock market crashes, so I can take full advantage and buy low. 

Also me: Don't like seeing money just doing nothing cause I know time is money, and gotta put it to work, and really want to buy stocks.
928 2018-05-08 16:47:12 Would you invest in stocks and stuff? Or would you start on a project you have maybe been sitting on for a while? I always love to hear stories like “I would open a bakery” or whatever.
929 2018-05-08 16:46:08 drop the attitude or face my plant based wrath
930 2018-05-08 16:45:50 Plan on combing your amazing method and adding a dividend growth twist (use your screen with dividend champions) for a long, long term hold with dividend growth stocks
931 2018-05-08 16:44:59 I got in just before the drop with my tax return cash, but man o man did people get a deal on $shop when it dropped to the 150's. Jealous. #stocks #investing #tsx
932 2018-05-08 16:43:16 Some people trade futures because they can't figure out which stocks to watch each day, but it only took me 14 months to solve that riddle.
933 2018-05-08 16:43:06 @senatorduff We respectfully ask you to call HB5542, the bill banning bump stocks, today. #callHB5542. @CAGVNews @ActTogetherCT @NewtownAction @CTDemand

935 2018-05-08 16:42:07 oh god I'm barely recovered from the met gala (my thesis) and now I have to contend with Eurovision week?? I didn't even think about my glitter stocks
936 2018-05-08 16:42:04 @KerriMPR How about limiting the amount of bullets that an accomplished marksman can fire in a particular amount of time and ban guns and accessories that would enable exceeding that amount in that time? Magazines, ammo belts, bump stocks etc.
937 2018-05-08 16:41:27 What's keeping stock prices up? Machine trading, market manipulation, wishful thinking, collective insanity? Bond rates are up, credit spreads are tightening, geo-political tensions at it's highest. Dump your stocks and grab your puts for pennys $NDX $SPX
938 2018-05-08 16:41:11 unlimited stocks wow shet calling ba e2 para mag collect

940 2018-05-08 16:39:56 1) only if you make seven figures or more per year.  The rest of us aren’t seeing ANY increase 
2) no, they are merely at the cyclical part where they need to hire for season.  Most corporations merely bought back stocks, inflating the price and enriching their CEOS

946 2018-05-08 16:38:04 2:14 PM EDT, 05/08/2018 (MT Newswires) -- MidEast stocks mostly declined, with investors cautious ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision about the Iran nuclear deal. Trump is slated to make his announcement at 2 PM ET.

965 2018-05-08 16:29:54 Many critics celebrating Trump's decision to upend Iran Deal were also cheerleaders of the Iraq War. Maybe foreign policy should be dictated by circus monkeys who throw darts to decide stocks.
966 2018-05-08 16:29:37 I visited @Jesse__Montana and we really talked about stocks and investments. What is life.
967 2018-05-08 16:29:11 Maybe 10% lower on stocks would be good ;-)
968 2018-05-08 16:29:06 Heniken would be more excited now after this news....

Any positive development can put the stocks on rapid fire mode
969 2018-05-08 16:29:03 I am glad you like this one... feeling good about my portfolio :)

976 2018-05-08 16:25:22 $tsla moving downward as traders think Iran will flood market with oil, thereby lowering the need for electric vehicles. This is just temporary bullshit as @elonmusk would say. Tesla is upward trending. Good chance of a pop upwards after 2pm Trump speech. #tesla #stocks #oil

987 2018-05-08 16:21:53 Jon you watch way way too much Fox or wacko news. The "bans" haven\t been written yet. Most people, ( the kids marching included) want bans on assault weapons, high cap magazines, bum stocks, have background checks and a registry.
988 2018-05-08 16:21:21 The top five stocks higher at noon today are $JEC, $EXPD, $EVHC, $IT, and $MLM.

997 2018-05-08 16:18:54 At time of purchase most stocks would fall in this category. I find that a portfolio made of a basket of such stocks is more defensive than what market refers to as defensive stocks!!
998 2018-05-08 16:18:31 Carnage for Argentine related stocks everywhere. Screw fundamentals when confidence is lost. Man, it's going to be a very tough May...

1005 2018-05-08 16:16:14 At time of purchase most of my stocks would fall in such basket. Let's say i put 5% of portfolio. If it falls and becomes 3% I buy more to take it to 5%. A good friend and v smart investor taught me this. Depending on conviction n risks I am willing to go 15% ish also in a stock.

1021 2018-05-08 16:13:12 Given the recent increase in oil prices, I wouldn't be surprised if we found out that Donald Trump had a lot of futures and options in oil stocks.
1022 2018-05-08 16:13:05 I mean the way he handled the scandal issue n now Facebook stocks are rising like crazy on the markets,other companies struggle to come back from that
1023 2018-05-08 16:12:34 they said unlimited stocks on CORE products so does it mean only the initial release will be unlimited? and the next release will be limited edition?
1024 2018-05-08 16:11:26 I'm middle class and I know how to handle my money.  I didn't get any tax cuts. Bonuses are one time handouts, hourly wages are stagnant. Example-  Apple bought back $100b worth of stocks, they didn't reinvest in their employees wages. But do go on.
1025 2018-05-08 16:11:15 Privé doing a nice job “unlimited stocks” unlike SM smh

1039 2018-05-08 16:08:07 Use it as an indicator of one potential outcome, not the outcome itself.
1040 2018-05-08 16:07:30 More like 6-4. Its favorable without izayoi stocks. But when she does, its hard especially on flight, 50/50 in the corner etc.
1041 2018-05-08 16:07:20 My 3 major investment mistakes:

1. Sold NFLX at $2.50/share
2. Sold AAPL at $17/share
3. Sold ADBE at $26 & $42/share

Summary: Not patient, not acting on Investment media "news", and investing in markets (indices) not stocks would have served me well.

1071 2018-05-08 15:58:48 Ideally the stock runs enough for the guru to get paid on their PP price or options and still enough meat on the bone for the little retail guy. 2017 no problem, this year not so much. Better to find your own stocks and do your own DD IMO

1081 2018-05-08 15:52:16 That is my impression as well. Either they do not understand the technology (Warren didn't buy Amazon&Google stocks back then), either they don't understand the technology until their bags are full.

1083 2018-05-08 15:51:16 Picking stocks is hellishly hard, I knew about CC but dismissed it as 30% sales bump. Even working for the company I did not see it.
1084 2018-05-08 15:51:15 $IPDN longs, please contact your brokerage firm and ask them to move your stocks from a margin account into the cash account or ask to take delivery of physical share certs. That way they can't lend the shares to short sellers and profit off of you. This is very effective.

1223 2018-05-08 15:02:18 Isn’t it like stocks, it’s value fluctuates? Bitcoin used one week to pay $35 charge could have value tens times that amount in a month. So it’s a fluctuating value currency that can be used as barter for purchasing.

1231 2018-05-08 14:57:19 Y I largely hunt in out of favour stocks: 
a) pessimism about biz = non crowded trade = leads 2 attractive valuations = limited downside. Hence EASIER 2 develop conviction.
b) Just SMALL improvement in biz can = big +ve move in stock.
c) Doesn't need intense tracking
1232 2018-05-08 14:56:30 You'll hear this a lot, and Buffett reiterated the point at the start of this years meeting. But nothing hurts more than selling too early. Not even a 100% loss. 
I have a geniuine fear of selling because of this. So I only buy stocks I'm comfortable holding forever.

1262 2018-05-08 14:42:56 Fair enough observation, however, tell me one time in history an incoming Prez like Trump?  Since that time, the Trump Tax Law made it possible for the mega rich to buy back their stocks and will ultimately become the biggest benefactors.

1303 2018-05-08 14:20:31 Buffett is completely delusional. It's largely because he made his fortune during a brief period in time in which every major currency is fiat only. Since losing currency peg in '67 with France Gold has outperformed stocks for most part.

1403 2018-05-08 13:40:43 For those that think this is all about Iran - it’s about the knee jerk to Iran. The agreement does little to fundamentals for at least 6 months. Any alt deal is likely in reality to make things worse in the region than better. Add to that all eyes on venz and stocks #OPEC #oil
1404 2018-05-08 13:40:35 Difference is that the bar of entry into stocks is a few hundred bucks of savings. Entry into #vanRE is now a few hundred thousand, aka exclusive to the wealthy. (Plus ofc land is limited, stocks are not.)
1405 2018-05-08 13:39:48 It won't happen. Even passing an assault weapons ban is near impossible. The best they can do is ban accessories like bump stocks. Limiting handguns is a dream. Plus you can make your own guns now. They sell kits online you can assemble yourself. It's not going to happen.

1444 2018-05-08 13:19:10 IMO with these crazy movers, it's so important to not get into the mentality of needing to "nail the stock" vs nailing the setup. As much POTENTIAL there is for a big move, I will avoid certain stocks to preserve mental capital as I know that is not where my strengths are.
1445 2018-05-08 13:17:23 This is what I was meaning to say :P I see meaningless fluctuations in the Market just because of something totally irrelevant. Just like Crypto... Also at the end of the day, laymen DO buy stocks/options just to sell it to someone who is willing to pay higher

1592 2018-05-08 11:50:08 There is enough idiosyncratic noise in equities and FX, that the movement of their respective vols shouldn't carry the expectation for one to mirror the other. Not everyone in stocks is in FX, and vice versa, and those with both can hedge the FX in a number of ways.

1616 2018-05-08 11:28:35 Joined up thinking is required as is a clear understanding of what the objective is.

Lumping tax on something doesn't always create a tax take (e.g. heartily debated by @ConHome when reducing top rate from 50 to 45%).

1619 2018-05-08 11:26:27 Why are US stocks doing so poorly relative to international stocks since your inauguration?
US stocks crushed international for 8 years under Obama.
1620 2018-05-08 11:26:23 Sensible from which viewpoint? 

I suspect not for those who find their tax / deductions rising by over 50% on their pension income (and have little choice but to pay it) whereas those with alternative assets would then create income in other ways and avoid the NI.
1621 2018-05-08 11:25:52 So are you telling me that's where you lost your sense of humour?

Or was it in the fantasy conspiracy land made by those who've shorted stocks perhaps?

In either case, I'm not a member of either of those clubs.

1727 2018-05-08 09:27:56 Everything helps me learn. However, i find that watching the dvds first then lessons/webinars is best. Traders should spend some time watching stocks throughout a few days and analyze price action and see the patterns/setups they want to trade play out.

1944 2018-05-08 06:05:46 Fund managers playing with other people's money. Otherwise, who in right mind will buy after such horrible results for huge tgts we see in brokerage reports for these stocks. Mutual Fund Sahi hai. SIP sahi hai.
1945 2018-05-08 06:05:13 Interesting @Lefsetz letter today on the major label’s immediate sale of Spotify stocks > ‘The stewards of the labels aren't thinking about tomorrow, just today. Isn't that how we got into this mess, the execs fighting to pull the business back to the past’
1946 2018-05-08 06:04:38 Sales tax? God you're not getting it. Transactions aren't just sales of goods. An employee is engaged in a transaction with their employer, sales of stocks are transactions,  etc. Land taxes only make money for the counties.
1947 2018-05-08 06:04:34 Would you take tech advice from a guy who is buddies with Bill Gates but never owned MSFT? Missed GOOG/AMZN? Does AAPL have a better moat than GOOG/AMZN? And then buying into AAPL share repo? There are no cheap tech stocks, just wrong estimates.
1948 2018-05-08 06:04:28 "Money doesn’t know how you made it. A hundred dollars made by solving easy problems (buying stocks where both your IQ and EQ were at their highest) buys as much as a hundred dollars that caused you to lose your hair."
1949 2018-05-08 06:03:47 The vast majority of #guncontrol advocates are not anti-gun. We want common sense #guncontrol with background checks, no loopholes, no bump stocks, no military style assault rifles. Personal protection by skilled, qualified permit holders is fine. So, no, not hypocritical.

1953 2018-05-08 05:59:32 Thanks to the work of Barak Obama, the USA is in pretty good financial nick.
I predict a false rally of American stocks, which in Australia will be pounced on by LNP, they will call an election towards the end of this year, with their "baby boomers budget"
1954 2018-05-08 05:59:31 Dear Atul, here the question is never about buying at lowest price & selling at highest price. It's about buying at highest price & selling at lowest price, under the guidance of expert. People have bought NCLT stocks at highest price & sold at lowest
1955 2018-05-08 05:58:35 Ever since the first full fiscal year under Trump started, stocks have been more volatile than they have ever been. The economy has been improving, yes, but this boom will only widen the gaps between rich and poor without creating a middle class.
1956 2018-05-08 05:57:29 Acting as senti and good wisher of retail investors....I doubt he gave buy call when he and his big client want to sell..How stocks came down 30-40% down after buy call...He is wolf..Be aware of such emotional mails..This is just tool to make fool..

1980 2018-05-08 05:40:08 2/2 We can also ban bump stocks although I don’t know how much of a difference that would make. They were used once but that is once too many. Lastly, ban AR’s? Why? What about handguns and shotguns?  Pretty sure handguns account for almost 80% of all gun deaths.

1988 2018-05-08 05:30:10 Just like using the stock market to say the economy is good when the vast majority of people are not in a financial situation to even have 3 months wages saved, let alone own any stocks. Health of economy should be measured by how well the poor are doing, not the wealthy.

1990 2018-05-08 05:28:48 I wonder if Tesla stocks took a dive
1991 2018-05-08 05:28:04 In dis result reason
IT,FMCG all expected to report gud result
so stocks run up
aftr gud result profit booking
In HEG,GI case no run up happened inspite of high expectation
So der might b only 2 ways stocks can react
1)consolidate
2) fly high

1992 2018-05-08 05:26:42 Almost 90% of calls are so called 'breakout' trades, after a 6-7% move call is given for the next 2%. Always felt this is more to offload their stocks to gullible retailers and  who never wants to put stop losses:-(

2255 2018-05-08 01:39:34 The NRA needs to get with the program.  Doubtful its members are so unflinchingly out of touch with the citizens of the US.  The NRA is becoming as predictably wrong as are the liberals.  "Bump stocks" and 40 round clips are really not necessary for civilians...

2262 2018-05-08 01:33:20 Exactly my thoughts that it's the Republican's and Conservative's family for sorting this to happen. They don't see that people's lives are more important than a few votes.
Bump stocks need to be banned, now.

2268 2018-05-08 01:30:53 This is the main reason imo. Same with building up the Atlantic Fleet to “combat” Russia again....all excuses to ramp up the war machine to make money for someone. Who has recently invested the most in wartime stocks?

2270 2018-05-08 01:30:00 No, bump stocks do not make full auto. They may make it shoot like a full auto but it still is a semi auto gun. There are other ways besides a bump stock.

2279 2018-05-08 01:18:30 Stocks are for the most part bullshit. Most ppl buy them for the same reason we buy crypto to sell to a greater fool. How many hot stocks pay dividends? Please.

2292 2018-05-08 01:01:10 My idea for the opioid crisis is stocks and bonds. Stocks like the ones you put your head through and you are pantsed by school kids.
2293 2018-05-08 00:57:53 The bump stocks are being banned. I’m talking a stock AR. I have one and it’s the same as shooting a semi automatic pistol and those have been around for 100 years. I’ve got a semi auto Colt that just turned  and still works.
2294 2018-05-08 00:56:38 @ZenTrends Hi Cody, could you look in your database if there is any non-leveraged ETFs that have performed better than $FDN and $QTEC over 3 years & 1 year? Both hold many of the stocks we like but may negate single stock risk.

2300 2018-05-08 00:48:57 I hoped everyone shorted their stocks and rebalanced their 401k’s tonight to a more conservative stance because as soon as Trump kills the Iran deal he is going to 86 the market.

2315 2018-05-08 00:30:23 Just think of it as a buying opportunity. Cheap stocks. Recessions are a natural part of economy and we will experience several more in our lifetime.
2316 2018-05-08 00:29:48 Correct, Stocks and Bonds are least interesting asset for #Tokenization, but they will still migrate to #Blockchain as we move from Analog/Electronic Ownership to Digital Ownership.
2317 2018-05-08 00:28:39 I have mixed feelings on this. I don't think SEC is staffed for investigations on these little flakey stocks. Anyone with 1/2 a brain would know that $LFIN was a very risky trade. The shorts & options holders got put in a tough spot because the stock hasn't traded since SEC halt.
