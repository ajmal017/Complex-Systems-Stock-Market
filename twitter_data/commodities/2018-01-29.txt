48 2018-01-29 21:06:51 It's easier to get through the transfer window if you remember that football is now a business. Players aren't local lads from around the corner. They are internationals that essentially are commodities to be traded back and forth.
49 2018-01-29 21:06:05 Correct! Commodities do not exist. I agree with this. However, we are debating semantics. Labor vouchers are given in exchange for products based on the amount of labor put in. What better word is there to use other than “value?”

54 2018-01-29 20:40:16 and we told you that private property is anything thats used to produce commodities, something that you and your brain dead buddies didn’t understand seen as they thought a car wasn’t a commodity and that selling a part of a car was “commodity production” lol

56 2018-01-29 20:29:17 those are also commodities, did the car itself produce them? No, they are commodities part of a larger commodity, it I removed a diamond from a ring did the ring produce the diamond? No, it was a part of the commodity of the ring you tool
57 2018-01-29 20:26:57 oh my god you are an actual idiot, does your television produce something that you can exchange either for other commodities or for money?

59 2018-01-29 20:24:56 private property are things that produce commodities for sale (and therefore use) and personal property tends to be a commodity itself, easy peasy
60 2018-01-29 20:22:21 "I was a commodities broker in 1984 and I had a stack, a foot high, of people who had invested into silver in 1979 and 1980.

79 2018-01-29 19:01:08 The bullish consensus is 91.5 % on a weekly basis for the stock indexes. Do 91.5% of the people win when they go to the casino? No! Take caution as the market is extremely overbought. Buy SPXS, or buy Out of the money Puts for protection. #Commodities #Stocks #Frorex #ETF

135 2018-01-29 15:16:08 There is also another bigger issue, If he didn't treat people like commodities, he might get more credit for helping. Trump demands credit, people demand respect!  If he gave a little he would receive. I'm just afraid that may be beyond his capabilities.
136 2018-01-29 15:13:31 Yes, me too. I’m wary of nostalgia for commodities but I do think there was a more open-minded sensibility to video stores. They were like the next best thing to a library. Sp*tify and movie streaming services always have an in-built corporate curation system...it’s so limiting
137 2018-01-29 15:10:48 That's how we've been killing the economy. When we stop spending lower denominations, we encourage hike in prices of commodities. Imagine if N1,000, N500, N200 and N100 notes are all made coins and the lower denominations are made into notes. It will check corruption/stealing.
138 2018-01-29 15:07:31 Lo de la descorrelación da para un largo debate. Por poner un ejemplo ejemplo la cartera de @azvalor cargada de commodities no se parece en nada a la de @MagallanesValue Microcaps y podría ser una buena cobertura ante una fase bajista.

237 2018-01-29 07:40:41 Why China,  heaven and earth?  What is regional integration supposed to achieve when Kenya is a member of several regional integration blocks who have plenty of fish and other commodities that Kenya prefers to import from elsewhere
238 2018-01-29 07:39:29 But it’s govt duty to ensure quality control by effective check on commodities & their prices
239 2018-01-29 07:38:03 Please check the price rise of the fuel. Since last 60 days the diesel prices are going through the roof.
I think the govt needs to take a stand on this.
Where is the acche din? Fuel prices are directly impacting the daily commodities. PLEASE NOTE - COMMON MAN IS SUFFERING

Markets only deliver perfect competition when there is perfect information.  That is not an impossible counsel: commodities markets often have near perfect information about current supply and demand.

Housing, not so much: uncleared markets atest market failure.

247 2018-01-29 06:07:40 I was unaware of that,I apologize. Still cannot fathom as to why you are not in IPL's team's radar for coaching. LHB's are precious commodities and you are right up there with Dada.

249 2018-01-29 05:56:23 I would actually prefer to see Asuka vs Charlotte. The Queen vs the Empress. Sure, Ronda is a good fighter, but can she work a pro wrestling match? That remains to be seen. At least we'll know what we're getting with Asuka and Charlotte, they're proven commodities in the ring.

253 2018-01-29 05:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
254 2018-01-29 05:15:54 Yes, memory is in huge demand but they're commodities, which is why they're all made in low cost countries
Same with solar cells. 

But sure, it could happen. Cost per watt dropped 12.5% in 2 quarters which means the price drop in one year will almost equal the tariff

261 2018-01-29 04:06:20 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
262 2018-01-29 04:02:28 And if I may add, this government has been indiscriminate in its use of the Essential Commodities Act - using it to control the prices of medical devices and regulate IP licensing deals. Globalisation for the world and price control raj for India.
263 2018-01-29 03:43:36 A única coisa certa no mercado de commodities é a volatilidade nos preços. Amarraram o país inteiro ao preço de uma só commodity e, surpresa, na primeira baixa prolongada do petróleo a economia colapsou, pois a ganância dos socialistas tinha matado o resto da economia.

264 2018-01-29 03:33:33 "whether we like it or not, we are being watched, numbered, and cataloged as commodities, our personal lives logically reconstructed and stored by companies we’ve never heard of and people we’ve never met"

267 2018-01-29 03:25:15 भ्रष्टाचार के चलते आज 3 पूर्व CM जेल में, अब कोई नहीं बचेगा: मोदी - It appears thayt Shri Modi government  had been failed to control commodities prices and certainly shall effect the tone of next election of 2019-We vote to BJP because there is no alyternative.
268 2018-01-29 03:24:11 This is the most right wing, biased thing I've ever heard on your show. The way the government was characterized w/o one reference to right-wing forces controlling prices, commodities, black market, media, & the support of the u.s. for countless nefarious acts is unconscionable.

272 2018-01-29 03:07:31 En realidad, no es invención alguna.. en los hechos, AMLO tiene como ejes de crecimiento económico estos dos commodities (Granos y petróleo), ambos producidos aquí a pesar de eficiencias, ventajas comparativas, tecnologías, etc.
273 2018-01-29 02:54:50 Minnesota United's Christian Ramirez left out of the @ussoccer_mnt squad tonight vs. Bosnia. A confounding decision since this is suppose to be massive "reboot" for the U.S. yet Morris and Zardes -- known commodities -- are playing instead of Ramirez. #MNUFC
274 2018-01-29 02:50:59 It is high time policy makers should ensure Ethics in Agriculture.India emerging as Food Adulterant Country having no appreciation of sanitary, phytosanitary aspects whatsoever that may jeopardise exports of almost all Agri commodities besides endangering lives of our own people.

279 2018-01-29 02:45:12 @SecretaryCarson @realDonaldTrump   The cost to taxpayers for programs to help people is $20/yr.  So it’s not the cost but families have deteriorated. Start back programs such as commodities cheese,rice, dry milk,and dry beans to feed kids. Stop SNAP
280 2018-01-29 02:45:09 Seems to me steemit has its roots in monetizing content. I think it is time to move #Resistance away from monetization. After all, it appears that money, commodities, markets ... you know.. it's called capitalism that is in the center of peoples woes. 

I use Linux for a reason.

283 2018-01-29 02:28:18 It's sure an odd coincidence that when the dollar busted down Commodities started picking up.


284 2018-01-29 02:11:17 By the way, inflation numbers are artificially held low, too. They don't add real commodities to the basket of goods they make their assessment on.

292 2018-01-29 01:25:54 True, we spent a lot of promotion money reversing the anti fat myth though.  Anyway, back to your original comment, I am aware of other commodities and their trade deal benefits. Nothing wrong with countering your comment with "Are you fulfilling it?"
293 2018-01-29 01:22:32 The service and relationship are valuable commodities. My family had a hardware, sheet metal, and roofing supply shop for decades.  The sense of community and networking of local experts and craftspeople was pretty great.
294 2018-01-29 01:16:29 Ok, was curious, we took a hit for other commodities twice now and I'd like to make sure those others make full usage of our hit.

298 2018-01-29 00:21:41 Absolutely wrong!  The mere fact he won rung in growth in the stock market, increases in commodities tied to economic growth and a general change in business activity which has been growing the economy.  Main drag now is the Fed tightening $$$.
299 2018-01-29 00:18:01 When the majority of the world uses $ as pricing basis for commodities it becomes clear dollar is the driver. Not just oil either. Almost all commodities the dollar will be a huge driver. You think it’s just a coincidence that dollar decline pairs with commodity index rise?
