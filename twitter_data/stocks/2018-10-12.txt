2 2018-10-13 23:50:03 That is the best question everyone must ask. Where is the money going? Bravo to you!

Here is the simple answer. Profit/Savings which goes into asset prices stocks bonds RE etc.. rather than the productive functional economy where the 99% live.
3 2018-10-13 23:48:57 all of #lithium is coming down off of it's prior run atm. The lithium futures do not bode well for any of the stocks here. I would look for the industry to shape up again.
4 2018-10-13 23:47:55 None of the support/resistance levels in these stocks are substantial. A good week next week and they will be right back over.

13 2018-10-13 23:36:38 We've been in a strong downtrend for the past week or so. Is it too soon to be thinking we have an intermediate bottom (or it's imminent), and stocks are now set up to rally into year end?  Or is there still more downside ahead?
14 2018-10-13 23:34:02 In a way it is about who has control of our country.
Since Trump became President, we have seen jobs created, less unemployed, stocks rose, U.S.A. Prisoners released, no ISIS attacks. 
So I say, Republicans do care more about Americans than evil Democrats.
15 2018-10-13 23:33:49 IS WALL STREET PUSHING STOCKS (to support trump & republicans before election?)  Although a strange poll, I heard republicans & trump need a strong stock market to retain younger voters, so they are "encouraging" wall street to push stocks.  Did Wall street tell you to buy?

40 2018-10-13 23:25:18 Despite U.S Stocks sinking dramatically in the last week, the economy still has plenty of momentum, with interest rates and the unemployment rate still low and wages still high. 9 year year economic expansion not over yet #SUACCF18

49 2018-10-13 23:08:21 It’s interesting how when that reporter told Lebron to “shut up and dribble” his level of support went up. &when Nike made Kap the face of their new campaign, Nike’s stocks went up, but when Kanye met with yalls president his music didn’t get more popular 
50 2018-10-13 23:05:52 EXECUTIVE ORDER 6: The term “asset’’ means and shall include all properties including funds, liquid assets (bank balances), receivables, stocks and bonds held in portfolios, insurance policies, shares in listed or unlisted companies, and all manner of fixed assets.
51 2018-10-13 23:00:37 Matt was probably blackmailed by @jontester few insurance companies. Raise rates or we pull out of Montana leaving your citizens nothing. Funny how insurance stocks went up 400 percent since Obama care. Insurance companies have major leverage since then. #WalkAway

54 2018-10-13 22:56:45 When will the UN speak out against the abuse?!  Locking up Trump's family and the crooked Congressmen who vote for things that raise their stocks would help stop the abuse too!!  Let's do tgat first, then rip babies from their parents.
55 2018-10-13 22:56:40 I literally do not need any of your money. I have a retirement fund & stocks & I’m only 21. This is just the natural way of life. I am above you, and I always have been. It is natural for Me to take without pity.

56 2018-10-13 22:55:54 Well, he's pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord which is bad for everyone. Also, all my stocks and shares took a big hit - in the letters the agents sent out they basically blamed Brexit and Trump.
57 2018-10-13 22:53:04 @Nouriel predicted the 2008 crisis, which was the result of the same Fiat manipulation that has led to our current asset price bubbles (stocks/housing), so I would expect him to again comment on this repetition of history we face. Maybe he was bought-off post 2008.

63 2018-10-13 22:46:07 How sweet. Since I just got a Scotia Itrades account it is clear to me that I have a lot to learn. My older son is teaching me how to buy stocks. While this is not a profitable enterprise it is a learning business and I will spend only minute bits of cash as I am not Bill Gates.
64 2018-10-13 22:46:06 I keep it about the tickers might reference what someone said but it's about the stocks... Someone chooses to personally attack me everytime - I'm broke, I can't find my own plays, MM being my father, friendship bullshit it's always the same... Back to family though

66 2018-10-13 22:45:07 The late January/early February stock swoon was said to be because of rising Treasury yields. Same with this month's. With US stocks hitting fresh record highs after the early 2018 slide, investors should rightly ponder why this time shouldn't  be different. $SPX $DJIA

73 2018-10-13 22:37:26 We are reaping the benefits from the Obama Administration. Not this Con Man. Those cuts went to the rich. Those Corporations are buying back stocks to play on the Stock Market instead of sharing it with their employees.
74 2018-10-13 22:37:01 Cheese and eggs?  Who stocks up with that amount of those?  2nd one looks like most batchelors’ fridges.  I knew a guy who only had Dr. Pepper in his fridge!
75 2018-10-13 22:34:04 Hard to say because a lot of 1999 tech companies are long gone. It would require some digging to come up with a number using only the stocks in the index at the time. The tech index today isn't the same. It was split between Communications Services and Information Technology.

77 2018-10-13 22:31:48 People are not suffering with Trump. They have jobs, greater security from criminals crossing the border, increased home ownership, increased wages, violent crime has decreased, more opportunities with business growth & stocks rising.

80 2018-10-13 22:28:35 As a novice technical trader in stocks, it is the up and down that makes you money not the sideways. Just so you know when you hear the news making it sound like a panic frenzy. Someone is always making money. Special thanks to Thomas Bilkowski books.

88 2018-10-13 22:19:44 Friday’s stock market rebound was a sight for sore eyes! The S&P500 closed above the 200 day moving average, keeping the uptrend alive. But we are not w/o damage. Small and Mid Cap stocks, real estate, industrials, materials and financials all remain below the 209 DMA. Troubling.

92 2018-10-13 22:10:19 December 31, 1999 was near the top of the tech bubble. What happened to Dow technology stocks since? Apple (AAPL) up 5,949%, Microsoft (MSFT) up 87%, IBM (IBM) up 30%, Intel (INTL) up just 9%, and favorite Cisco Systems (CSCO) is down 14%. Who knew? It's why l own index funds!
93 2018-10-13 22:09:05 So is @fordnation taking credit for energy stocks taking a tumble the last few days?  Don’t be fooled people.
94 2018-10-13 22:08:44 Stock markets have a habit of slumping or autocorrecting. Ppl who play stocks know how to ride the ride & falls. Media is very silly to make Stock Market sound as indicator of economic well being particularly when there is history of insider dealing in Pakistani stock market.

151 2018-10-13 21:14:26 The availability of services at a location depend on few factors like the type of item, coverage of courier partners, and policies of the respective sellers. In case you like a product, you buy it while the stocks are available with sellers. -Rajas

157 2018-10-13 21:09:08 Hussman seems to always think stocks are overvalued and has been predicting crashes for at least the last 5 years. One of his charts seems to suggest that since 1990 stocks were only fairly valued in 2009. Maybe his perspective is a bit too negative?

162 2018-10-13 21:06:39 Psst. 4th liner is code word for bad player. If your team stocks up on fourth liners to block prospects they're stocking up on bad players.
163 2018-10-13 21:06:17 Rule of thumb on stocks. By the time average people get info on a stock. It’s too late to make money.
164 2018-10-13 21:05:51 despite the fact that probably is ponzi scheme and so on it s really stupid to sell apt to invest in something that went to 17k from few cents. could have happened with any stocks. In something new with such a trajectory you just put spare money that you don t need.

171 2018-10-13 21:00:05 It's our poor folks economy!!!! I can't afford stocks. Neither can any other poor folks. You don't have a clue how we have to live.
172 2018-10-13 20:57:24 You can make a living by swiping stocks, but the condition is you must be damn wealthy. #rationaleinvestor
173 2018-10-13 20:55:53 The computer/algo are progress, 100%. Investors used to have to pay a "specialist" 1/8 per share to trade stocks, which would be like USPS charging $2 to mail a letter. Sign of financial oligopoly that it lasted as long as it did!
174 2018-10-13 20:51:51 Not to mention that since Q4 2012 stocks have more than doubled... yet valuations (by this measure) unchanged due to strong top line growth + tax cuts
175 2018-10-13 20:51:17 Get rid if bump stocks, limit magazine sizes, update gun registration. My favorite idea is one that America's founding fathers supported and enacted which is requiring regular inspections.
176 2018-10-13 20:49:29 He publicly stated that he has no financial ties in crypto and advocates people put money into gold and stocks but so far he already told people not to touch BTC losing out on 30,000% profit potential. If BTC continues to rise while metals and stocks fall his reputation is shot
177 2018-10-13 20:48:48 Oath mate.. Good money to be made from here but need to choose wisely i reckon.. the strong stocks will rally..
178 2018-10-13 20:45:22 OMG. What kind of fool are you.  Are people back to work. Stocks up more money coming home to families if corporations are making money stock go up  people get jobs. More jobs less people to fill them. Pay goes up   Nice Democrat talking point
179 2018-10-13 20:43:29 She us right... people are back working..stocks are up...housing is doing well...
180 2018-10-13 20:43:28 Honestly, not even thinking about changes to himself, I think he's already going to benefit from Ultimate's changes. Defensive options being nerfed and the meta very likely being 3 stocks means Lucario has more chances to utilize aura and will be able to pressure better.
181 2018-10-13 20:43:09 You just asked what it's called. The only other answer is stocks or being  drug dealer
182 2018-10-13 20:42:24 I have thought about this too, but what is in the sales tax?  Do you count stocks that are not in 401ks/IRAs?  Loopholes are what need to be closed.
183 2018-10-13 20:41:59 Which stocks can one invest in?
184 2018-10-13 20:41:02 I’ve ordered them all from depop! Lots of people are selling unused ones or ones they’ve swathed on their hand but never worn! But the new Morphe store in Westfields stocks his products!! I need to go soon do you wanna come with me?
185 2018-10-13 20:40:25 Is it OK to not approve of either blocking or dumping at superspeedway speeds? I feel both of them deserve a full year's sentence in Hobby Stocks at their local short tracks before resuming in a top tier series.
186 2018-10-13 20:37:49 Pot stocks in an uptrend don't see it dumping like people think. It's been in a corrective phase so let's see if we can see new highs.
187 2018-10-13 20:36:27 The fundemantals of small/mid size/ and large companies hasn’t looked this good in decades. Small cap stocks are booming. You don’t have to like Trump but I specialize in markets and the economy and cutting taxes and burdensome regs is the main reason we are growing 4% a quarter
188 2018-10-13 20:35:40 Yes sarcasm, since banning assault weapons & bump stocks seems to be a joking matter to shooters. 

Freedom comes with responsibility not only for oneself but also for the society one belongs to. 

One child saved is worth any pleasure lost for shooters.

195 2018-10-13 20:23:08 No, many of us do both. I select stocks abroad with extensive fundamental bottom-up equity research (on the ground, with Mgmt, suppliers/competitors- these details are CRITICAL). But how do I choose where to devote these hours? The macro drives step 1

200 2018-10-13 20:17:09 price manipulation's the rule in stocks, too.. they just legalize the ways quicker.
201 2018-10-13 20:17:08 1) Starting in 2010 I did some serious trend study. Among other things I studied snap-backs such as Friday's. I correlated the names and strength of stocks that snapped back on the 1st day with the eventual swing winners. The 1st day was the weakest correlation (very low).

207 2018-10-13 20:09:25 Two actually, both of which hold no value to me whatsoever...Not a car, or my home, or stocks, etc. I noticed you're very sour lately.=) Is there something in particular that's troubling you?
208 2018-10-13 20:08:27 Lots of stocks showing great snap back potential and some important ones looking like they still want a bit lower.

A positive close in the broad market indices next week would be a big win. Its going to be choppy.
209 2018-10-13 20:07:10 10 year bull run has to pull back at some point. I think gold and $btc are great hedges against the trad market. Tech stocks extremely over valued, buyers are exhausted, market is over bought, boomers are retiring and exiting the market, shit is topped
210 2018-10-13 20:06:07 Does anyone know about stocks and the stock market?
211 2018-10-13 20:04:53 Georgia..?  :D Right outside the Atl. in Marietta...yall have a good weekend,..  Checking up on everyones feedback on stocks and comments about what i missed.
212 2018-10-13 20:03:45 Yep, that’s a big win. I’ll track my team, you track the stocks.
213 2018-10-13 20:03:27 You're a smart man. I really like MJ, its an etf. I just got into the stock market about a year ago so still fairly new to it man lol. Done lots of research, especially in weed stocks though.
214 2018-10-13 20:03:21 Getting into trading stocks. Last time I tried I lost $1k in a month. Started with $1k to begin with. This time I'm taking it with a more conservative approach, just $5 to begin with! I guess I have to (re-) start somewhere. For me that's really, really small (for now). #stocks
215 2018-10-13 20:03:08 Corporate law is antithetical to free markets. Stocks may represent private ownership, but corporate law is an indirect subsidy and government intervention. Corporate law causes many of the problems government uses as an excuse to regulate.

220 2018-10-13 19:57:16 They are right in this case. DO NOT sell/cash out when value down. You will loose your shirt. Only 2 times really matter. When you buy stocks and when you sell them. The rest is artificial accounting. Now is the time to buy if you can, or wait it out until they go back up.
221 2018-10-13 19:56:26 And bonds and stocks have been correlated since 2012 at least.  Front run the central banks.   Bonds will once again play its role as income generation once that crap in all assists classes is cleared away.  But the central banks have tried to prevent this cleansing function.
222 2018-10-13 19:55:30 So stocks going up because we mortgaged our children's future by cutting tax rates is a good thing why?  There is so many other ways that money could have been spent that would have gotten us much bigger bang for the buck and helped all of America, not just the wealthy.
223 2018-10-13 19:53:56 yg’s stocks and income are still higher, even higher than jyp’s

245 2018-10-13 19:35:09 This year? ...to new lows....next year we will see. But some stocks will go up in this period due to stronger fundamentals and mispricing. Stay away from tech...!
246 2018-10-13 19:35:02 And I do consider everyone on this text more knowledgeable about u stocks than I am so I appreciate it!
247 2018-10-13 19:33:52 Lost in the TL. I don't buy the UCLA piece,leave out so much. Ppl in 20s w extra cash wanted stocks-stocks scarce. Stocks of legit companies had chunks of their stocks bought by shell co. One shell co spun off another. Margins low. When crash,margins got called. -1
248 2018-10-13 19:32:50 Sure. An intelligent woman is invaluable due to her great advice nd wise opinion. Her higher standard of character and elevated ideas helps to cultivate a relationship in numerous ways. Teach urself about stocks and real estate. A man wants to share his interests with his partner
249 2018-10-13 19:31:44 But, but, but the slump in tech stocks is a buying opportunity... okay, pile your savings in then.

Or, perhaps last week wasn’t even part way toward a correction. Valuation is about bond market now, and all that maturing Corp junk debt over next four years.

255 2018-10-13 19:24:56 If you’re talking about banking, this is pretty over the top. Banks are performing a service. You can put your  wealth toward stocks, gold, real estate etc. and hold the rest of your cash. Rappers who get robbed wish they put it in a bank.

257 2018-10-13 19:23:05 People who pay for, and thus enable data caps, deserve to be put in stocks and get all kinds of rotten fruits thrown at them

260 2018-10-13 19:18:18 Asian markets mixed on strong Chinese trade data

SINGAPORE (AP) — Asian stocks were mixed on Friday as better-than-expected Chinese trade data gave some markets a breather from worries about the impact of punitive tariffs.
261 2018-10-13 19:18:07 U would be correct however the article states all his losses were do to real estate and had nothing to do with stocks.  The loses u can fraudulently claim in real estate can be astronomical.  Remember Trump supposedly claimed real estate loses and didn’t pay taxes for years.
262 2018-10-13 19:17:27 the 1%-6% people lose in EV to the house edge is maybe worth it to them for a sweat. they'd lose much quicker at poker/lottery/even stocks. and flipping at a disadvantage might be the only thing they can beat "game" wise

267 2018-10-13 19:15:04 I support the 2nd Amendment but like 90% of America believe we needed expanded background checks, I would like bump stocks outlawed and want REAL measures for mentally ill people to be addressed. I don't believe that they should be able to own guns. Anything else?

26 states, including red states OK, NM, FL, & ME, passed gun control laws in <5months. Bump stocks banned in 8 states & counting. ~250K voters registered by gun control groups. If they get better at policy, the next knock on your door will be to take all your guns away.

314 2018-10-13 18:23:38 Thanks. Wouldn't touch Danske with a barge pole. My biggest investment regret of the year is not going short when the Estonia news came out. Stocks never do well in uncertainty and bank stocks even less. Will look up the other two.
315 2018-10-13 18:23:01 All the good giveaways are always only for US citizens  Speaking of that, do you know where in the UK stocks The Elizas? I hate ordering from Amazon!
316 2018-10-13 18:22:41 20% of the stocks would create 80% of the wealth. And 80% of the wealth would be created in 20% of time. So have a focused portfolio and be prepared for lumpy returns.
317 2018-10-13 18:22:35 Anyone can google how much of a liar you are. Beto wants universal background checks, not to take "popular" guns away. You're talking about bump stocks which Trump has also said he wants to ban. Trump changes his story depending what kind of crowd he is in front of just like you.

323 2018-10-13 18:16:17 Stocks perform well in the months leading up to an initial rate hike. When the Fed first raised rates in 1994 1999 and 2004, the S&P500 rallied 11% 21% and 18% respectively in the 12months prior to the moves. Stocks then declined in the subsequent months period after a hike

333 2018-10-13 18:09:56 The ultimate cause of the economic crisis of 2008 was back in the early 80s when the Reagan Admin pushed through deregulation of stocks and securities. The collapse was delayed by the rise of the internet as a brand new industry.

378 2018-10-13 17:32:16 @carterthomas Hi Carter. Any new videos in the cards soon? Missing your viewpoint on stocks and crypto both. Enjoy your weekend!
379 2018-10-13 17:29:44 If I look at the indices and #stocks, there is a lot of volatility. It's like the 'chaos' after a storm. Wait until the 'chaos' settles a little bit and new pattern appear. Means: Wait until the odds are high to make money in stocks.
380 2018-10-13 17:29:35 We covered all stocks worth a swing or a hold into earnings, same list as the other post, added one more symbol, stocks are a much easier read
381 2018-10-13 17:29:13 Personally I think it was both inevitable, and planned... This crash in stocks will divert funds from traditional stocks/bonds/financial systems into the modern/crypto/blockchain financial systems.. The end game is OneWorld.... Easiest way to do it, is change global finance...
382 2018-10-13 17:28:01 My general #watchlists contains only very few #stocks. I will observe them to find out when the market is ready to move again.

385 2018-10-13 17:25:19 Market losses in USA were widespread, and stocks that have been the biggest winners on the market suffered steep declines. #Apple and #Amazon, the two most valuable companies in the S&P 500, each had their worst day in two and a half years. #SQQQ gained % as #AAPL and #AMZN fell.
386 2018-10-13 17:25:15 Weekend routine is done. Best charts: Gold miners, f.e. $SA, $KL – Cannabis #stocks $CGC $APHQF $ACBFF – $MTCH.
387 2018-10-13 17:24:10 US. stocks plunged Wednesday as investors, fearful that rising interest rates and trade tensions could hurt company profits, ramped up their selling of high-flying technology and internet stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 831 points, its worst loss in eight months.
388 2018-10-13 17:22:05 Don't let Mr. Market dictates our investment action. Pick our stocks as if we invest in the business. We can relate with this fact: 70% of M&A is considered failed and one of the reason is because they pay "too much". So are we pay too much for our investments?
389 2018-10-13 17:21:47 Govt should not justify it should take corrective measures savings of people like me who are from middle class are invested in stocks if it falls below current levels it will be very dangerous !
390 2018-10-13 17:21:00 Vosine appears to be in keeping with the precedent listed in Heller for regulating arms.

A ban on bumps stocks has not been heard by SCOTUS. However, a lower Federal Court has ruled they constitute arms and as such their manufacturer is entitled to protections under the PLCAA.

395 2018-10-13 17:17:54 Don#39;t panic if double-digit gains in your stocks shrink fast. Hereâs what you should do: If a leading stock you own soars 20% or more…
396 2018-10-13 17:17:41 tbh I always thought the big3 were big3 because of the quality of stuff they put out and not because of the stocks.. they put out more innovative stuff and create trends which other companies follow.. what’s so hard to grasp about this
397 2018-10-13 17:16:58 All I know is calls in tech stocks are real cheap for earnings.
398 2018-10-13 17:14:03 Stock buy backs, I thought companies sold bonds to buy stocks back? You said something in you vid about margin selling?
399 2018-10-13 17:13:22 Found the following relevant for October:
1. Very hard to short a market when the financial stocks(XLF)... watching them closely next week ... for continuation
2.More market bottoms take place in October than in any other month. A simple observation that i made over the years.
400 2018-10-13 17:13:10 Looking at my portfolio is giving me heart palpitations, these people need to fix their trade disputes so my stocks can behave again

402 2018-10-13 17:12:18 There are value stocks that have just corrected on their way up - BRK/B is probably what a lot of people think of. There's also expensive stuff like $XBI, $SMH, and $TSLA that may be entering downtrends. It's recently stared paying off to be short expensive junk.

405 2018-10-13 17:11:21 The plan was to see if I would do better trading stocks over forex and that answer is no.  I am going to keep trading but I am starting over with backtesting on forex.  While I am doing that I can save up to replace the money I lost in stocks

414 2018-10-13 17:02:32 Sounds to me like Apple's line of watches are the real winner here through serendipity. It's not ridiculous to expect a bump in sales soon, so I recommend Apple stocks. #MoneyNeverSleeps

424 2018-10-13 16:55:58 not to worry.  stocks are only for the benefit of a select few.

428 2018-10-13 16:54:26 All right now. People want to lecture me about that stocks rise and fall. You need to have accountability when you are there facing down these situations. My word on this was clear. You can't just cherry pick something because it does not fit your agenda. This is Trump's mistake.
429 2018-10-13 16:52:55 You put people first or put profit first. At the moment it’s not a game it’s a war - stocks are the scorecard (votes are the bullets)

437 2018-10-13 16:49:08 I agree FI is a better investment than stocks that’s why I have my money in it. Let’s say I offer you two shares. One that will payout 60p for three years and then be worthless and one that will payout 20p for 10 years but you must sell it within three. How do you value them?

450 2018-10-13 16:39:21 Trump is opposed to the Fed’s raising interest rates & causing stocks to temporarily decline. It’s the responsibility of Federal Government to help control inflation, not tamper with interest rates while US economy is exceeding in growth as it is currently doing under Trump.
451 2018-10-13 16:38:20 Sold $HEAR for 12% gain yesterday (bought at $18.70 on 10/11/18 and sold at $21.02). Couple key points: 

1) Market was favorable. 3 out of 4 stocks move w/ the market. In that sense, the timing turned out to be accurate. 

2) $HEAR had impt catalyst + high vol so it moved.

496 2018-10-13 16:10:09 I like the first BAOunce. It’s quick but u cannot be early and have to be over float rotated high demand stocks. We discuss this apart of the club every day. Or zombie hours find stocks that consolidated where shorts think they win and it zombies them
497 2018-10-13 16:09:51 Market cap is a measurement for a corporate's stocks not currency, XRP is currency, he's right btw...congrats for you..
498 2018-10-13 16:08:28 I’m investing in stocks

500 2018-10-13 16:07:38 I  bag holders . Don’t hold too long you see this hold out before , plenty of great stocks out to get you $$ back.
501 2018-10-13 16:07:07 Tip - Day traders typically do not keep any positions or own any securities overnight. Swing trading is based on identifying swings in stocks, commodities and currencies that take place over a period of days. A swing trade may take a few days to a few weeks to work out.

505 2018-10-13 16:04:59 this is false!! very misleading!! stocks surged after
Trump won!!! from 18,589 to 25399 today!! you phony
graph doesn't show that does it!!?? you are lying!!!!!
506 2018-10-13 16:04:16 Part of being prudent may be deciding which stocks to pick up more of while others are busy panicking.
507 2018-10-13 16:01:32 Good for Auto ancillaries & tyre stocks
508 2018-10-13 16:00:50 US stocks, but we're trading a lot of Canadian companies lately, tickers with F astroturfing the end, up to you
509 2018-10-13 16:00:12 Stocks are shares of a particular company that that company sells to the public.
510 2018-10-13 15:59:41 If you struggled with your trading this past week...reflect, recalibrate and get ready to re-engage next week. Study both sides of the market in-depth so you are flexible in your #trading. The more prepared you become, the fewer surprises you face. #girlswhotrade #stocks #study
511 2018-10-13 15:58:14 If you are wealthy or have money in stocks, you are doing well.  If you have healthcare from your employer, you’re doing great.  If you are in the service industries, you are screwed.  Working two jobs and having a family, is that making America great? No!
512 2018-10-13 15:57:45 “October: This is one of the particularly dangerous months to #invest in stocks. Other dangerous months are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.”

- Mark Twain
513 2018-10-13 15:54:58 We are the piggy bank of the earth. They just fire the printing press up and make it out of thin air. We are 21 trillion in debt and another 21 trillion MISSING. USA dollar is 99.99 percent depreciated. Stocks and all that is played by a video game.
514 2018-10-13 15:53:54 MY NIGGA WHAT?!?! Me and my mama have literally had this conversation hahaha student loans would’ve been paid, stocks would’ve been purchased, and a nice nest egg. That nigga would’ve been my benefactor 
515 2018-10-13 15:53:41 Sir, I wonder how many stocks do you have in your portfolio.. So many buying your doing.. Aren't u diluting returns?
516 2018-10-13 15:53:07 US stocks are plummeting like the Chinese won the Korean War.
517 2018-10-13 15:53:05 things, it is pretty specifically not indicative that the markets are worried about a major crisis. There is broad agreement that US stocks will report higher earnings in 2019 than 2018 (with the usual caveats that were just as true 2 weeks ago as now).
Good poker players...
518 2018-10-13 15:51:37 A worker, is worthy of their wages. Unless they work they shouldn’t eat. Investing provides additional wealth if you have a “right” strategy. A friend gardens for relaxation, if she picks a tomato she looks for the right one. I do the same for stocks, I  twenty and select one.
519 2018-10-13 15:50:55 Both phone out of stocks
520 2018-10-13 15:50:46 If it ends up being 3 stocks then it should be more consistent based on that fact alone, but we shall see though.
521 2018-10-13 15:50:07 Sure! I find China is pretty ok as a vegetarian, they have the right kind of Buddhism, and once you have a bit of Chinese under your belt you can do fine. As usual you have to watch out for stocks / seasonings in non-veg places.
522 2018-10-13 15:48:56 Why traders use Margin? Can someone explain? From what I read once margin calls hit, the stocks you own with margins are sold at market price. U can't even hold for come back. Dangerous no? $mu $amat $amd $baba $bidu $amzn $jpm $googl $ba $lmt $bac $tlry $noc $rtn $tsla.
523 2018-10-13 15:47:45 Yeah, the top 10% have most of their $ in stocks that are only taxed at 5%. So it really doesn't matter where they live or what they do unlike "The losers on the bottom" where that income matters and is a great deal more painful to lose
524 2018-10-13 15:47:32 I agree. I saw some signs of a pullback coming and totally ignored them. Major signs around the market like indexes not aligning and some stocks getting sold off. It was like a perfect match from the book How to Make Money in Stocks
525 2018-10-13 15:45:27 Hey , what’s the future pps look like in a year do you think ?

529 2018-10-13 15:43:24 Cavuto is a ardent anti trumper. He wants to hype up fear. Next week will stocks will rally ( people ain’t buying this guys fear mongering) only in news can people be so wrong so many times and still keep a job. These types want @realDonaldTrump  to fail to say they r right
530 2018-10-13 15:41:33 The overall Twitter sentiment seems to be bearish, there's literally no other way then down, it seems.

I'm still extremely bullish on crypto & commodities.
Extremely bearish on the current monetary system, stocks & the current housing prices.

538 2018-10-13 15:33:19 Thank you so much for the effort! If that's the case can I choose to keep the unsecured order money with you guys. So that as soon as the physical stocks in stores have been secured and the order will be taken in?
539 2018-10-13 15:33:16 Scam artists r good at what they do, example how many elderly have been scam/ out of their entire savings by scam artists coming 2 their door 2repair roof driveways or get them 2buy bogus stocks. Most campaign offices hv volunteers that arent use 2dealing with this kind of thing
540 2018-10-13 15:32:59 Brothers homie, with an appreciation for beautiful frames and beauty 10x stocks! Haha
541 2018-10-13 15:31:08 I'd just like to say good evening to all of you except that one popular local beauty store which did not put on sale their stocks of The Ordinary's niacinamide + zinc serum, and now hiked their prices from P500 to P1500.
542 2018-10-13 15:30:55 Ah and that intersect point where we agree completely. #WeThePeople need to have the power. A system where central banks can buy stocks or whatever asset class and then dump them on the market all with intent to manipulate markets is not a recipe for success.

545 2018-10-13 15:29:37 At the moment they aren't restocking online, so we are trying to secure stocks from physical stores whenever we can!
546 2018-10-13 15:28:23 Yes seriously, they are losing, and now they are selling off stocks to make the market dip so they can blame it on @realDonaldTrump. This whole thing is a process to undermine the lower and middle classes of America. They think we are deplorable, unintelligent, and need guidance.
547 2018-10-13 15:27:40 @timseymour Tim, you think this Wed will be a sell the news type event for C stocks?
548 2018-10-13 15:27:36 My stock portfolio numbers are where they need to be. Up 50% in the last month. For now my portfolio consists of automotive, pharmaceutical, semiconductor, cloud computing, and cannabis company stocks. Glad I discovered @RobinhoodApp
549 2018-10-13 15:26:29 Higher rate environment is ushering in higher volatility for stocks, I think the issue here, is we do not know how Large tech (higher weighted) will trade in this environment, or how future cash flows should be valued
550 2018-10-13 15:26:18 When it comes to money, taking risks means investing in things that can go down in value — like stocks, real estate or anything else. Can you get through life without taking risks? Sure, but as my dad was fond of saying, you’ll never get a hit from the dugout. #investing #money

560 2018-10-13 15:20:31 This means to focus more on the index and not the stocks ?
561 2018-10-13 15:19:46 Day trading requires an intimate understanding of the market and how it works as well as a keen eye. It also has to be your main focus if you want any success. The market grows over time. Do your research and pick stocks you think will grow and sit back and let your money work.
562 2018-10-13 15:17:10 Do you have visibility for Earnings growth improvement for high weightage NIFTY stocks ? or whatever be the earnings outcome NIFTY would still climb higher ?

568 2018-10-13 15:13:43 Yeah. Every day - some new abomination. *sigh* My daughter & her fiancé, have a large garden, thankfully. Although, it’s non-GMO/organic, I’m still appalled that Monsanto bought up 40% of the heirloom seed stocks/companies.

581 2018-10-13 15:03:23 True about DB pensions but wrong about housing. I made money on all the houses I bought in the 1990s. Here's a bigger problem, I think, the 2008/2009 crash scared many people out of stocks and they have missed all the runup since then. Houses too, rented instead of buying.
582 2018-10-13 15:02:31 Why didn’t congress bring fact out that Dr Ford has stocks in the abortion pill??  Or fact that she works on committees to get President Trump out of office??  Or that she and Fienstiens husband work together??  Hmmmm?? Ford had motives to lie about the confirmation

607 2018-10-13 14:40:51 Just with the options action on $pyx , A LOT of money is guessing on calls Oct 19th between 50/65 and Nov calls 50/75... way more than puts. 4M of volume this Friday (50% of the float) which make me think it’s accumulation at 42.5/43.0 by algos.

609 2018-10-13 14:39:52 Just a reminder : Amazon moving up your minimum wage to $15$/hr while they're also taking away your monthly bonus opportunities, and your stocks you use to get for your anniversaries. It's all just for show.
610 2018-10-13 14:39:13 When you could sell

1) Use Stairs technique for stocks advancing in 40-65 degree ie old resistance becomes support & sell when price closes below that support which was a resistance earlier.

2) For stocks advancing above 70 degree, sell into strength at 1st sign of weakness.
611 2018-10-13 14:38:15 You know that most people do not own any stocks, right?
612 2018-10-13 14:37:42 Fully agreed.  These so called experts B******s like tulsian , sharma , shah of geojit etc on CNBC  have created  lot of losses to investors who followed them  since last ten years. They recommend stocks which has already jacked high by their own cartel which SEBI to investigate.
613 2018-10-13 14:37:34 I'm glad you're in this but if you like crypto for what it is you wouldnt br into xrp.  You want a centralized bank coin go get BOFA stocks.  XRP devs own majority of the coin, that's not crypto, learn more.
614 2018-10-13 14:37:01 “20% of the stocks would create 80% of the wealth. And 80% of the wealth would be created in 20% of time. So have a focused portfolio and be prepared for lumpy returns.”

617 2018-10-13 14:35:51 Stocks prices are driven by sentiment. Poor sentiment and economic uncertainty makes NSE the cheapest asset class in the world today. Single digit PE ratios make expected returns high even if economy ramins mediocre.
618 2018-10-13 14:35:44 oh and besides you know that the @TRXC has 42 million shares. It represents about 40% of current stocks. In addition, they want to sell #TRXC 15.5 million Shares to Sofar SPA, a pharmaceutical company that developed ALF-X. These shares will expire in September 2016
619 2018-10-13 14:34:39 Well, the people haven't voted for all this, because none of this was made clear in the Ref, but their elected representatives have knowingly voted for this catastrophic situation.

626 2018-10-13 14:28:39 This is true. BUT, after viewing the stock prices, that could also be motivation TO go - as over the next 10 years WWE is set to make millions....In a blink of an eye, the stocks could go from $85 to $60 - The stockholders always have the last word.
627 2018-10-13 14:28:27 It's a residual but can increase at the same time as investment when growth is high. More so with variable capacity. Grasselli & Nguyen have added consumption with stocks as the residual, but of course very complex model.
628 2018-10-13 14:27:29 From Yemeni army stocks. Yemen in 2000s purchased small batches of different modern Russian weapon - SVU, OSV-96, PKP, RPK-203
629 2018-10-13 14:27:04 The mainstream media -- the same folks who told you "Trump can't possibly win" and then "if he wins the markets will crash" -- they've been proven dead wrong.

Since the election, stocks have soared.

637 2018-10-13 14:19:47 Rate riku kwira again soon. Now the impact will be very huge. The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange is now in a bubble (overpriced) because pple offloaded their bond notes buying stocks ( huge demand).

643 2018-10-13 14:13:11 @BradHeffington should be right long term. Supply should tighten especially considering India and China lower stocks. Question is how hard does China hold on Soybeans and Cotton with Trump. Clearly Trump is going try to extract many concessions and looks like good leverage to me

Everything is politics. The Lemmings who pray to the #MSM will move against Trump and the #GOP. The rich #Dems would rather
648 2018-10-13 14:10:40 I have sold all my stocks at first fall of Jan 2008 ,but never had the courage to buyback at any price. Realised that one has to travel the valleys to climb the mountains.

662 2018-10-13 14:02:08 Finally the stock market has begun to reevaluate the "new" economic situation. The beginning of the response to QE and some of its ramifications. This will be a several year process maybe just beginning. #stocks #QE #wsj #Fed

666 2018-10-13 13:59:18 15 yrs is a long period. 15 yrs back there was no Dmart. A new form of retail may emerge in nxt 15yrs and Dmart may not exist too
Why love the stocks even when they disappoint on earning metrics.
If the trend continues, Dmart will be derated to 30-40 PE. However 100 PE is insane.

672 2018-10-13 13:56:37 Stocks are easy. The market doesn't like low unemployment or higher wages. It drives inflation, which drives up interest rates, further hurting the middle class, and poor, which favors the bond market. And you thought the 1% cared about you!
673 2018-10-13 13:56:13 Traders not taking bond notes. Does it imply that they taking rtgs which they then use to purchase stocks on ZSE as evidenced by massive activity

683 2018-10-13 13:41:43 Bear markets are no fun during the initial sell off, but once confirmed the fewer stocks that are being accumulated are far easier to identify on market. Decent short term news flow is a must, honour resistance levels on the chart when trading and always sell the news...
684 2018-10-13 13:41:35 There are ~ 1500 stocks listed on #NSE.

687 2018-10-13 13:40:09 May mga nakausap ko na still buying stocks even puro loss ung port nila. Kaya minsan iniisip ko, is it even a good idea investing in the same company na going downhill? Is it best to wait until the company goes up again rather than investing more into it?

689 2018-10-13 13:39:32 My quant colleague used to trade 8k stocks at once because of the improved risk effect, often with low to negative friction (e.g. earning rebates as the portfolio cycles around different % in different issues). In the future, perhaps retail will get closer to that, 25% vs. 0.12%
690 2018-10-13 13:39:18 Yes, trend follower, though I have learned to call it ‘absolute momentum’ as traditional TFers get very upset when someone uses same method on stocks. Only stocks, not regd as CTA.

692 2018-10-13 13:38:21 So out of 31 different stocks in my portfolio only two ended up in the green after this week's bloodbath.  Walgreens and Starbucks. Drugs and coffee...yup.
693 2018-10-13 13:37:11 All depends how good the  AI  developers were originally. There is also an art to picking stocks. One that I have never learned. If you want to make money in market do the opposite of what I did my whole life.
694 2018-10-13 13:36:25 the stock behaved very well this week, holding above the lows, while other stocks were tanking on Wstreet.
695 2018-10-13 13:34:58 Comeone let's focus on the bigger stuff, like the corporate who is sucking out the peoples economy from the middle class, and then buys back their stocks and yachts instead of paying their tax that will build infrastructure...
696 2018-10-13 13:33:41 I love the decline in crypto prices almost as much as i welcome a decline in stock values .  .  . long term thinking and patience. If you really HODL - whether it's quality stocks or quality crypto - what are you afraid of?

702 2018-10-13 13:30:50 excellent tweets Miserly..my only observation is some momentum stocks can crash straight down into single figure p/e deep value...#SOM was close to that this week for instance intraday Thursday based on my interpretation of their likely earnings
703 2018-10-13 13:30:39 Lol close

705 2018-10-13 13:29:32 The good thing of this pullback, if it is just a pullback, is that once out of reach stocks, can now set up.
706 2018-10-13 13:29:26 Fed is ending the era of easy money too quickly. Rising rates sent stocks spiraling lower this week.

758 2018-10-13 12:48:31 2000+ stocks sounds like a recipe for inefficient asset allocation due to uninformed investing (unless it's a roll-your-own index fund).
759 2018-10-13 12:48:17 Perhaps “full disclosure” would be disclosing non-crypto stocks or bank alliances.

762 2018-10-13 12:45:47 Very Good article on options but I feel stocks are easier to read and gain from.
763 2018-10-13 12:44:19 Finance tip: Don't invest in stocks if you don't have stable income, or if your income is still too low. The best thing to do is focus on increasing your income first.
764 2018-10-13 12:43:48 #PMModi #FM & other Ministers are spinning lies on GDP growth of 7.4% & excellent state of economy. It is a #JOBLESSGROWTH contrary to promises of 3Cr jobs of #PMModi.Removing rent;interest;salaries;stocks & foreign technical services GDP will be less than 3% @RahulGandhi
765 2018-10-13 12:43:48 @FinBrain_tech do you provide a demo account or a trial account?it is difficult to understand what is offered and the presentation of the information provided from your website without being able to access at least few stocks?
766 2018-10-13 12:42:35 Agree except for pot stocks. No patient access (effectively situation in Aus) = no industry. When that sinks in plenty will lose big on get-rich-quick investments.

771 2018-10-13 12:38:18 There are more relevant news sources like business standard which keep publishing rumours for NBFC’s and 2-3 days later it’s all wrong. Unfortunately in the middle these stocks get shot down.

775 2018-10-13 12:35:34 After owning a Model X for 2 months, I sold all other stocks and invest in Tesla only. I will get another Tesla next year and another one after. All ICE cars will be replaced by Tesla. Consider EVs from other brands? Yes, but no one in the same league yet.

824 2018-10-13 11:35:13 When stocks are down cash is up. I have no long-tern core positions, and I trade only high probability set-ups with conservative profit targets. I stop out with max of 1% loss on a position. No windfalls, just steady gains compounded regularly offset by tolerable losses. #Trading
825 2018-10-13 11:34:32 Quality of #earnings across #US #stocks are camouflaged by falling share counts which account for more than one quarter of the big #banks’ #EPS growth this year, and more than half next year #stocksinnews #StockMarket #stocks #DJIA #NASDAQ

844 2018-10-13 11:15:41 I agree. Research is all that matters. For instance: I invest in BTC, and I will not encourage someone else to do it.

I've not done my research on Nigerian stocks, but I've looked at our economy as a whole and I've written it off for the next 4 years.

882 2018-10-13 10:39:04 He loses money shorting Tesla stocks and make up fiction about how Tesla selling more cars is bad business. He is a basic short shill.
883 2018-10-13 10:37:59 This thread is good. I disagree that USD denominated are the *only* way to go. When you invest, you just have to make sure your returns consistently beat the bogey man (inflation).
Any money I have today would go to buying Nigerian public stocks. They are so darn cheap right now.
884 2018-10-13 10:37:39 Now is the perfect time to put stocks into DASH. watch it go up 6% by tomorrow afternoon. And I expect monero to go up 2%-4%. Big gains tomorrow for those other who invest as well. Cryptocurrencies are not just the future, they are the now.
885 2018-10-13 10:36:04 The new Stocks app looks much glossier now but gets in its own way. I want charts not news (I have a news app). If I see the whole chart prices are hidden. If I drag the chart down to see prices I only see half the chart. On a daily chart, why is the horizontal axis logarithmic?

897 2018-10-13 10:23:02 Most pot stocks didn’t really sell off considering the week we had - most green weeks - $cgc inside week with green week last year- I don’t like trading this garbage but there could be a really nice measured move in $cgc next week!  $mj and $cron green weeks too
898 2018-10-13 10:22:45 Of course I have stocks! I've invested into many farm produce companies! Gotta finance them apples 
899 2018-10-13 10:20:50 I have nothing against VMY, I hold good position for more than a year, my style is to watch even a stock go to zero, gives me much stronger motivation to select better stocks next time. That is the only way to discipline ourselves in resource sector. Hope VMY will come good.

901 2018-10-13 10:18:25 Congratulations to lovely Lorraine who has been helping tidy Stocks’s for 20 years today! She celebrated by coming in for Open Day!
902 2018-10-13 10:18:22 StockMarkets follow US stock futures. US Fed increased 7x consecutively since 2015 interest rate & US economy outlook is alike 2008. In panic world stocks can crash probably in nxt 12 months  Pk stock exchange falling streak is due to Int'l scena, not @ImranKhanPTI reigning power
903 2018-10-13 10:17:53 The point is clear and undisputable. Still, if I would like to play the devil's advocate I would argue that "long-term investment" in the survey can be quite tricky since in the very long term stocks came out to be the best asset class to be invested in
904 2018-10-13 10:17:09 Tbh the market looks bearish as hell. 
For stocks...interest rates.. and everything else that’s coming that’ll  cause another recession. Yet big guys are watching this train wreck& printing more $,and they choose to now call out bitcoin as a scam. I am sooo bullish on bitcoin now

914 2018-10-13 10:11:17 I totally agree to this! I bought some Nigerian company stocks and they have just been moving one step forward 2 backwards... Am even tired of checking my investment portfolio because I just get angry...but then what early bird company do you recommend investing in?
915 2018-10-13 10:10:16 @NikeStoreEurope Le maillot PSG x Jordan flight knit 23 sera mis en vente à quelle date? les stocks seront-ils suffisants? Je fais référence au 1er octobre 9h du matin ou j'attendais la mise en vente et malheureusement impossible de l'ajouter au panier...
916 2018-10-13 10:07:24 Swiss Alps Energy is one of the best ico that ive ever seen and have a unique idea. I did not see the project more interesting on the Internet. #SAMTokens #Swissalpsmining #finance #stocks #altcoin #tokensale
917 2018-10-13 10:07:04 Quality-Momentum stocks certainly seem ripe for a further fall given their  run-up over last few years. A company doesn’t double in a year due to compounding of high returns of capital, there must be a market sentiment part of the re-rating and that can reverse very quickly.
918 2018-10-13 10:06:31 Ekdum barobar everyday u ppls suggest 30-40 stocks target hits 1-2 and stoploss hits 28 but fullday @CNBCTV18Live @CNBC_Awaaz highlights yeh sabse pehle humne bola tha even same for @ZeeBusiness ..kalka RBL kud kud ke sab bol rahe thee buy fir wahase 20-30 rupees dwn
919 2018-10-13 10:05:34 Cannot agree more.
Food for thought. You cannot pinpoint at the 20% stocks that will give you 80% returns, nor can you time the buy to chase the 80% returns.
920 2018-10-13 10:05:03 US Bonds will do well again after the economy starts to do poorly. Investors don't hold bonds. Everybody is invested in stocks and real estate.
921 2018-10-13 10:01:38 Completely agree. The spike in US bond yields triggered the fall in equity markets. Momentum strategies exaggerated the moves in growth stocks (ie stops getting triggered). Don't see any reason to suspect a recession is here. Company updates continue to be strong in my portfolio.
922 2018-10-13 10:01:20 You should be worried because your pension fund invested heavily into FB and other "tech" stocks, and FB stock will crash without warning some day soon, taking entire line-up of "tech" investment frauds down with it. And Suckerberg already screwed up so Trump cannot be blamed.
923 2018-10-13 10:00:55 I'm inspired! A very serious approach to implementation. A team with highly qualified specialists. Success is imminent! #bitcoin #ethereum #ICO #cryptocurrency #blockchain #smartcontracts #finance #stocks #altcoin #tokensale

925 2018-10-13 09:57:21 I used the same logic more than a year ago to get into VMY , I will hold VMY and add again if a CR comes again as it  should, time frame of exit 2020/21/22. Reg GXU , such stocks  backed by MMs can go up 10X or 20X in a matter of weeks, may be a good idea to exit at that time.
926 2018-10-13 09:57:02 It gets worse they are now suggesting we allow them to repent just like Henry 2 . Perhaps we should bring back the stocks for wrongdoers , Mr Johnson covered in rotten veg now that appeals.
927 2018-10-13 09:56:14 So I take it you are a trend follower? Do you only trade stocks or do you trade any other markets. I'm curious because we seem to trade very similar although I think I probably have a bit higher risk tolerance. I was up about 25%, after this last week up about 8%.
928 2018-10-13 09:54:38 I'm in SM SEASIDE CEBU rn and i checked NBS they don't have stocks yett! I'll come back next next week~~ But i'll still accept orders for TIME MAGAZINE : OCTOBER 22,2018!! Will post details on this, payment first basis.

934 2018-10-13 09:48:17 Always like a value play. Most #uk homebuilders  are low multiple stocks due to #Brexit. For example #bdev (just paid fat dividend) and #rdw which recently provided it's trading statement....  both 6, 7 x stocks.

938 2018-10-13 09:44:23 Superbly written.... I never sold. I moved money around, to be sure, out of some stocks and into others. But I never pulled any money out of the market to put under my mattress. I never tried to time things and wait for the volatility to settle down.
939 2018-10-13 09:44:00 It's pointless asking them about it.. they've taken orders clearly without planning stocks or logistics..
940 2018-10-13 09:42:33 So good they can keep buying back their own stocks.....

960 2018-10-13 09:13:11 WW FDR & LBJ did most 2 destroy middleclass because they separated the people from real money & forced them on2 privately issued debt based federal reserve note. This, with lower interest rates, is why wages have stayed down while assets like stocks bonds & real estate have risen
961 2018-10-13 09:12:33 Everything is down from then.I mean even best stocks.
962 2018-10-13 09:12:28 of course, thet its CEO bumped stocks for 60%, he earned a lot of money. really a lot of money (nearly 1 million of USA dollars). so can a fair business play this way? no, cant #TRXC #AvoidTRXC #Scam #Fraud

Some stocks follow 150 or 100 or even 50. While some stocks  remain choppy for years so no EMA can be applied to them

High volatility can only give you thrill like that of a roller coaster but you mostly can't make money from it.

1009 2018-10-13 08:15:02 Stocks don’t crash from a top. There will be some kind of rally before that happens. We went through the same thing in February. However in this market anything could happen!

1012 2018-10-13 08:10:24 RT CNNBusiness: Stocks open lower but rebound from sharp overnight losses. Dow falls 50 points, or 0.2%. The S&P 500 is on track for its sixth down day in a row. Square sinks 6% after announcing CFO departure. Sears loses another 7% on bankruptcy fears. Watch live …

1031 2018-10-13 07:39:08 It would depend what fields you invested in; market wise I’m talking. If you can look into the long term and got spare coin that can withstand a market tumble, then sure go with long term stocks. It’s these medium term and nervous investors that get screwed over during collapses.

1063 2018-10-13 06:51:33 I am a novice in stocks but here are my views. Are funds allowed to sell large percentage of portfolio if valuations heat up/or guess a downturn is eminent n move to cash? Funds will/can under perform once every few years. Also do they have the flexibility like an individual.
1064 2018-10-13 06:49:06 I would think so too. Like, I wouldn't buy it now at least (stocks, not weed itself lol). But one shall not underestimate how crazy people could be, so, I don't want to short it at the moment either...

1097 2018-10-13 05:50:13 Yeah, a paradigm shift has taken place. Suddenly unhealthy men with beer bellies and AR’s (with bump stocks) in their hands are whining and crying like offended school girls, everytime someone takes a punch at them. Snowflakes indeed.
1098 2018-10-13 05:49:59 This is incorrect. Most stocks have been undervalued for a long time. Why should fianancing government debt be a way for earning "safe" money? Raising rates just lower bond prices and hurts exports by strengthening the dollar, which then lowers stocks as well, retirement funds.
1099 2018-10-13 05:49:08 Just stick to the hustle, maybe invest in stocks.

1128 2018-10-13 05:10:46 Stocks are based on market value. Stock up accordingly.
1129 2018-10-13 05:10:42 At least the stocks are semi-available.
1130 2018-10-13 05:09:57 I understand.  The fact that the stocks trading price means so much to Mr Musk is all one needs to know to reveal his true motive.
1131 2018-10-13 05:09:44 All my tweets reflect my personal opinion and none of them should be considered as a buying recommendation. I also do a lot of Option Strategies with Stocks I own to enhance Returns or minimize losses which I cannot post. Having said that what do you find wrong with ibulhsgfin?

Your anti-gay utterances to join you husband in his anti-gay political stance isn't just funny because you're a homophobic old lady.  It's funny because Mike is the poster boy for closeted homosexuals worldwide.  He's gay.

1197 2018-10-13 04:03:28 It's a racket. People don't understand the market. Every time there is a downward swing in stocks, most regular people get looted and plundered because they don't get the long term nature of it and rush to sell. What's going on is a tragedy.
1198 2018-10-13 04:03:12 Stocks of Indiabulls, Adani and Reliance ADAG group stocks are getting moved up. Along with some high beta, counters are hitting the upper circuit are the sign of sky is getting clear. Though no need to be extremely bullish on NBFCs.
1199 2018-10-13 04:03:11 Just looked at volatility index, it's nt encouraging. When was last time vix went above 18. But trend index is down as stocks r beaten down, bounce should happen. New leaders of fall will emerge.

1205 2018-10-13 03:59:07 I literally just bought 3900 dollars in apple stocks and my dad is heated 
1206 2018-10-13 03:58:40 People like her are why I genuinely believe that public shaming & stocks in the town square should still be a viable punishment. What a piece of garbage
1207 2018-10-13 03:58:05 Most my stocks are US at this point. With the exception of Aurora. A bit of a curveball on them with uplisting and possible deal.
1208 2018-10-13 03:57:21 On the last post about Soybeans, I missed if the "Dow" continues to drop-so should the Dollar. Also wheat and Corn are looking better on the charts. Stay long wheat, but wait to add on. Lower buy-stops on the the indexes to take a profit. #Commodities #Stocks #Agriculture #Grains
1209 2018-10-13 03:56:52 it sure is hard to focus on my parents talking abt the importance of stocks while my brain is making apocalypse survival plans for environmental collapse in 2030
1210 2018-10-13 03:55:50 You must be fully invested in stocks.  There will be great buying opportunities when it all crashes.  It’s artificially inflated by corporate buy back, easy money, and growing govt. and corporate debt..
1211 2018-10-13 03:55:03 i think most of the stocks would be obivous. youd do pretty well holding ford and general motors starting in 1918 for example

and youd probably remember to sell in 1929 before the crash
1212 2018-10-13 03:52:18 Like in 1918 knowing to buy Google or Amazon is useless. What stocks will go up between 1918 & 1929?  Not sure I know. I also don’t know who won World Series for a few years. I could easily waste the $1000 I’m theoretically given.
1213 2018-10-13 03:50:51 CESc up understandable.... But analyst om channels will cohert calls of  collateral benefits in future group  ...  Future groups stocks will increase because of this ... And some retailers will get trapped... Chasing stories or chasing values... ?
1214 2018-10-13 03:49:24 Finance. I dropped law and picked up forex and stocks. Ain't regret it yet
1215 2018-10-13 03:47:16 Does that mean they could be sold out for today but there would be more stocks tomorrow??

1219 2018-10-13 03:41:40 Don#39;t panic if double-digit gains in your stocks shrink fast. Hereâs what you should do
1220 2018-10-13 03:40:33 50%.... you are kidding right? It's more like pretty much everyone and that goes to any one investing in bonds, forex, stocks, real estate etc! People may preach, pretend and even believe in the tech but like the grade goes "show me the money!!!"
1221 2018-10-13 03:40:19 Great to see the analyst forecast a big jump in #Uranium spot price the beginning of next year to circa $40 and steadily rising to $60 within 2 years.  The last time spot was at $60 virtually all current U stocks were 10 - 20 times current share prices! IMO it is a one way bet!
1222 2018-10-13 03:39:38 We don’t sell our houses if prices go down few days later of buying it because we know that it’s price will go up in long run then why to sell stocks when it went down few minutes later of buying it.
1223 2018-10-13 03:39:30 I've done well with MJ (ticker symbol). It's an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). If you're not familiar with ETFs, they're like mutual funds but trade like stocks, i.e. when you buy or sell, it happens immediately--not at day's end. You can buy ETFs through most any retirement IRA.
1224 2018-10-13 03:36:22 Ahhh fair. I think once he becomes an actual Daddy will it rise again for me. 

The stocks, rising. Ahem. 

But they’re too sexy a couple for me. Like Brangelina. It’s overdose.

1229 2018-10-13 03:35:13 Salaries at the top went way up. Higher than ever. And ownership reinvested their profits in their stocks. Some new jobs were added but not at a higher rate than was improving year by year since the Obama recovery. Facts.

1234 2018-10-13 03:30:16 Dropping market is a good news. An intelligent investor should buy the stocks at bargain prices during market decline.
1235 2018-10-13 03:30:02 வருமானம் கூடியுள்ளதா, Consumption கூடியுள்ளதா, Stocks without demand - prices would come down. e-g. Prices came down during DeMon. Prices of seasonal agricultural commodities not reflect the conditions of economy.
1236 2018-10-13 03:29:12 Corrections (profit taking) are good. Stocks will be climbing higher.

1240 2018-10-13 03:22:17 Are we winning? Ask Ford employees, anyone putting gas in their car or grocery shopping. Ask Harley and Trane employees, investors in stocks, farmers who export. We are not winning. At least not the 99%.
1241 2018-10-13 03:22:05 #rpiFTI My explicit costs are commissions and accrual reversal.  And my implicit trading cost should be price trend, but it's very small, coz all stocks I bought have good liquidity, so orders finished quickly. Accrual reversal is larger. But commissions is easy to measure.

1268 2018-10-13 02:55:53 When the stocks go up in record numbers, the media focuses on Robert Mueller and Stormy Daniels, when it's bad they blame Donald Trump for the saggy stocks. Fake news!!!
1269 2018-10-13 02:55:32 everything is overpriced. I hear people talking about stocks with a 15X P/S ratio as if it is cheap to buy. Insanity.
1270 2018-10-13 02:55:13 When the stock markets are through the roof the media does not report it but when the stocks tumbles, it's major news. The media only focuses on the bad things surrounding Donald Trump.
1271 2018-10-13 02:54:58 How's that "resisting" going? 2 supreme court judges, tax cuts, wall started, unemployment way down, stocks way up...................not going so well huh?
1272 2018-10-13 02:52:49 TAKE A LOOK AT WALL STREET STOCKS ARE FED UP CAUSE OF 45 TARIFFS
1273 2018-10-13 02:51:37 Not during the stagflationary Volker years! But more important is that it doesn't matter if it's "the right reason" or "the wrong reason"... WHATEVER the reason, houses, cars and stocks get considerably more expensive!
1274 2018-10-13 02:50:09 You worried about  physical appearance I’m worried about investing in stocks. We are not the same

1278 2018-10-13 02:44:37 Donald “the dumbass” crows about all the jobs and how great the stock market has been under him - riding on Obama’s coattails but okay - now stocks losing more than it has in YEARS thousands of layoffs coming - but not his fault. Encouraging hate and violence...
1279 2018-10-13 02:44:16 Let me guess, you have no idea what the term blue chip even means. Right? Gotcha didn’t I. Don’t be embarrassed most people that tweet about “their stocks” have never even purchased any type of security through an individual brokerage account.

1283 2018-10-13 02:42:32 Lmao!! This is the worst article ever written. What about equity? Building Credit? Using the equity and credit to purchase more? Doubling up? Tripling up? With renting you can’t create more credit. Real estate in general is a better more safe and sound investment than stocks

1303 2018-10-13 02:18:40 Only people who own stocks received a benefit... teachers, military, policemen, store workers, small business employees, hourly workers, waiters... who typically don’t have stocks were left in the dark.

1305 2018-10-13 02:13:34 I say:  Learn about stocks (try the internet).  Then own some. Your life and economy will turn around.
1306 2018-10-13 02:12:29 Shopping for clothes in stores always just kind of reminds me how no one stocks for my body type and it makes me feel very fat to bargain with sizes over choice of style.

1309 2018-10-13 02:10:38 That was my first thought as well, I give that prospect little chance of going forward. So I’ve come up with my sencond option and one more pleasing to my thinking. Losing TBell makes little or no sense to me as our ruck stocks average & he being a club highly regarded leader.
1310 2018-10-13 02:10:20 stocks are depressing
1311 2018-10-13 02:10:01 The only way he’ll listen is if the stocks suddenly dropped if he comes out to say they’re still doing the show there.
1312 2018-10-13 02:09:52 Maybe from the shakeup of the tech sector? Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix, Amazon are no longer counted as tech stocks- moved to Comm Services, Telecom, Consumer Services...
1313 2018-10-13 02:09:12 'Futurist' wasn't a word in 1918. You would've been 'that loudmouth schnook at the end of the bar talking crazy talk about shorting buggy whip stocks or some nonsense about the Habs not promoting Bowman to GM when they had the chance.'
1314 2018-10-13 02:08:10 At first I read the beginning as socks instead of stocks and I was very confused.
1315 2018-10-13 02:07:41 Sure dude I’m sure stocks like Enron, Kodak or blockbuster were bought back.
1316 2018-10-13 02:07:19 How’s I’ve made most of my money,
1. Stocks and bonds                                        2. Stockings and bondage                               3.  Chicken stock and James Bond

She was a single parent widow from when her son was around 5, and a Croatian immigrant. She owned three properties when she passed. That was America. What is it now? Stocks and bankers.

1325 2018-10-13 01:54:21 "Where did anyone get subsidized education?" Universties are subsidized....by taxpayers. Or go your way...what percent of university students in the US come from families already of wealth...where they cash in stocks to pay for their kids degrees?

1329 2018-10-13 01:51:58 Yeah stocks paying people for doing no work for dividends or risking no money other than other owners selling more lowering the price.

The only freedoms I’d want to limit is finance, there is no reason for many of these companies to be public, it’s a cost in aggregate.
1330 2018-10-13 01:50:34 That's not other people's fault that you don't understand stocks????
1331 2018-10-13 01:49:08 I'm dreading the next recession. The Fed is still sitting on stocks from the prior bailout, GOP has run up the debt, interest rates are still extremely low. It means gov't will have limited resources to fix the economy.

1333 2018-10-13 01:48:58 Financial rates are making investors back out. People are becoming frightened of the market somewhat. People are selling certain energy stocks. Slower tech stocks while the worldwide economy is faulting. Investments are growing dominately on metals while switching from stocks.

1336 2018-10-13 01:44:33 Idt you understand the difference between utility of goods & an arbitrage trade

Arbitrage/delivery can occur for real goods with utility like corn, or contracts like shares of a company

If you can reason that money should be conserved for labor & management, you’d limit stocks
1337 2018-10-13 01:43:21 PSA= trading educators need an IB agreement to be a professional, if you’re nterested in trading stocks, educating yourself is a must. I just saved hella money and I’m currently unfollowing fake traders.

1344 2018-10-13 01:38:19 People ask, why trade YM when ES more liquid. Answer is much more reliable in movement with 30 stocks and less shenanigans.   I have no prob flopping 10s and20s and frankly that size works for me.  Next week I’m setting my default to 40 and we shall se

1351 2018-10-13 01:34:07 What has he done well? And we won’t know the effects of his economic policy for years yet (stocks are speculation and not indicative of the overall economy) he’s riding the Obama trends at the moment, so that can’t be something to boast about.

- The blue wave has come, and the CCP concept stocks are dangerous.
1354 2018-10-13 01:32:32 I think investors start focusing on the US. Canadian stocks are over priced at this point and there is still a lot of concerns with the retail side of the business in Canada. I think Canadian listed, American companies like $tcnnf $lhsif $mmnff $mpxef $ithuf get the attention
1355 2018-10-13 01:32:13 The jobs were there from President Obama,  the tax breaks were for the top 1-3%; the deal with China is hurting America all except Ivanka shes benefiting from that & the stocks were already good the jury is still out on Korea but you people BELIEVE all his lies & BS wake up.
1356 2018-10-13 01:31:38 It's like every day they report "stocks are mixed today". No Kidding. Some up, some down. Genius
1357 2018-10-13 01:29:31 The poster literally said “you can have bump stocks” that’s where it could’ve ended  but instead add that last line in that makes the first part where they agreed useless
1358 2018-10-13 01:29:28 I think the employees and management at my sephora just don't give a shit. Half the time they don't even know what they're selling. My ulta at least stocks the shelves.
1359 2018-10-13 01:29:14 Should add the poll : Sell Canadian pot stocks and buy Us
1360 2018-10-13 01:27:32 But you didn’t comment on what I was talking about so once again why reply me ?? My focus was on the fact that this person is acting like she can’t be for gun ownership while saying what SHE feels could be worked on aka bump stocks which is true. Her example about car vs gun

1377 2018-10-13 01:14:45 I have a friend in it. I don’t hope stocks drop on anyone. I owned INPX for months and got more on the way down. Not my cup of tea.
1378 2018-10-13 01:12:03 are you sure you have enough stocks????
1379 2018-10-13 01:10:57 I mean, you're a CEO.
The stock is at $10/share.
(a) you go with Plan A. Everything is fine. The stock stays at $10/share.
(b) you go with Plan B. The stocks goes up to $12/share for a month, and then the company folds and the stock is worthless.
This advice says you must pick B.

1392 2018-10-13 00:59:13 Same tight budget here. Although it varied with commission (laid off now, less than a week). Tax cuts? Didn't feel it. Company? Eliminated my channel, despite the cuts. 

Anyway I knew nothing about stocks til recently but the Robinhood app makes it easy to use understand for all

1409 2018-10-13 00:44:34 Oh wow there’s more... do you get drunk and walk around telling stock brokers about how penny stocks are the next big thing? All of his hate came from the fact that you don’t know wtf you’re talking about... Go back to BWW and have your fantasy big board there

1411 2018-10-13 00:43:38 I don’t want to get into the game of touting individual stocks. 
My advice for investors who want #cannabis exposure would be to buy an ETF for the sector, such as $HMMJ. It seems to be holding in the $23-24 range after big run-up. 
If it sinks, it could be a buying opportunity.
1412 2018-10-13 00:43:25 So far I've only seen dog photos in 3D on Facebook. If this trend continues, I could see FB stocks skyrocketing.

1432 2018-10-13 00:29:47 I’m sympathetic, but not understanding stocks is not a good excuse to denigrate investment in the market. You can learn. My sister spent 2-3 months researching what goes on in the market and then made quite a bit of money through investing smaller to larger amounts.

As a guy making less than 40k a year my taxes have gone down and due to the tax cuts my company who hates our President gave every employee a raise and bonus of stocks because of the tax cuts. I’m not a 1% he’s full of shite
1442 2018-10-13 00:23:50 $SPY $QQQ $DIA $IWM just finished scanning thru 100 or so charts. Even stocks that bounced hard today with bullish daily candles, still formed bearish weekly candles.

1520 2018-10-14 23:28:26 That financial instrument is called a bond. So you suggest to outlaw stocks and reclassify bond from liabilities to capital?
1521 2018-10-14 23:27:44 Every time someone mentions either Eminem or MGK, Mountain Dew stocks go up
1522 2018-10-14 23:23:50 was he sent to the stocks afterwards
1523 2018-10-14 23:19:41 That much net worth is not in a savings account. It is in stocks, bonds and other investments. You don't pay taxes on any of that until you sell it. Banks only insure up to $250k. That's not where wealthy people put their money.

1536 2018-10-14 23:05:40 I do not support a waiting period for one simple reason.  While a law abiding citizen is waiting, they could be gunned down by a  criminal that does not follow rules.  I see no need for bump stocks.  The so called "assault weapon" has already been banned. Do you support abortion?
1537 2018-10-14 23:05:34 Stocks are mostly speculative anyways, everyone likes to watch the demise of others (when people slow to pass an accident - ever thankful it's not them).  @elonmusk seems to be untouchable - ask our mutual friend
1538 2018-10-14 23:05:05 All good man. That point of view is  keeping american stocks reasonable for me 
1539 2018-10-14 23:04:27 Is that their vehicles bought by amazon.  Until I see a drastic price change in stocks I am not feeding into it.
1540 2018-10-14 23:03:23 A little time in the stocks before the Weeny Roast would be a good step, too!
1541 2018-10-14 23:00:13 Agree. Repeal the Patriot Act, current gun bans on Fully Automatic & defend our AR-15 & bump stocks! Smh to those who think the opposite.

1551 2018-10-14 22:49:34 RT ThroatPunchG "RT AnnaKrukCorbin: I don't own or understand stocks.

We are a lower middle class family on a strict, paycheck-to-paycheck budget.

I budget $35 for gas each payday. 
Today, I paid $45.

Last week's grocery bill was $30 higher than we're used to paying. 

Ho…
1552 2018-10-14 22:49:29 This is exactly why it should be a crime for a member of the House or Senate to have substantial family holdings in medical device or pharma stocks while voting on our health care.
1553 2018-10-14 22:44:06 Googly eye stocks are way up.  There is suddenly a nation wide shortage.
1554 2018-10-14 22:43:15 Minnie Driver the licensed practical nurse is checking/trading/buying/selling stocks but is eaten and digested by Whitney Houston.
1555 2018-10-14 22:43:13 Banning bump stocks was this dude's top criticism. 

Face it, aside from some of his childishness, he's been great for this country.
1556 2018-10-14 22:36:33 Hope their stocks drop 50%. Hope the prince is incarcerated like he did to his family etc.....then replace him with someone with integrity, intelligence & mind for human rights. Open prisons!

1559 2018-10-14 22:32:35 Highly partisan primary voters may get duped by party bosses, but general election voters would be stupid to vote for a House or Senate candidate who owns millions in medical device or pharma stocks while voting on our health care. Unless they enjoy paying more for health care...

1561 2018-10-14 22:29:52 Even the NRA pushed to ban bump stocks.  Most Americans were for that ban.  Sometimes you have to except what you don’t agree with.   That by no means doesn’t disqualify trump as being conservative
1562 2018-10-14 22:28:44 Watch out for scam stocks, nothing wrong with trading. Just avoid falling for social media based manipulators.
1563 2018-10-14 22:28:43 Depends on where you are in life. I’m nearing retirement so I have also moved more into low risk bonds rather than stocks. I do think the recent sell off isn’t justified and presents a decent buying opportunity. Remember the old adage: Risk not thy whole wad!
1564 2018-10-14 22:28:39 And if you shorted all of ARK’s stocks like your short TSLA, you’d be sleeping in a totaled van down by the river.
1565 2018-10-14 22:26:38 I guess you haven't seen their stocks.  I'm here in China right now and they are worried.
1566 2018-10-14 22:25:55 Ok. We will see wont we? I just moved my biggest investments to extreme low risk so I'm good. Sold 80% of stocks. All is good here.

1591 2018-10-14 22:00:46 Sterling will find its appropriate level to allow trade. Probably will go lower to start with and then bounce back. Low sterling can give high stock market for foreign stocks.

Can the Dems do that? Hope so.
1595 2018-10-14 21:57:04 Well done. Reactions have been so visceral. It was a kiss. They have been publicly humiliated, I'm sure some people won't be happy until that are put in the stocks, or hung drawn and quartered.
It's a dance comp, they wernt the best or worst.
Voters made the right choice.

1612 2018-10-14 21:43:59 Great Job @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump , Keep the economic engine moving. Stocks will go up, investors take a profit, stocks go down, and when its down, investors will buy in again. For the Dems who dont understand it, just keep calm. dont get your mobs blocking streets.
1613 2018-10-14 21:43:52 Same here. Was so into this theme couple years ago when Trudeau got elected and more States were legalizing. Now the stocks are in a frenzy and there's a legalization story on the news every night. 
1614 2018-10-14 21:42:42 Man if I don’t make money on my stocks tomorrow somebody dying.
1615 2018-10-14 21:40:12 This strategy is a lot more sophisticated and scares people. It's hard understanding inflation, now add risk-adjusted or time-adjusted inflation to the mix.

The non-initiated want a stable asset with stable returns. We don't want to pick stocks and end up very unlucky.
1616 2018-10-14 21:37:07 You're expecting that I don't understand economics. Inflation will happen, but not to the extent that it will negate the fact that after 200 months the $5000 is still a wiser choice. I do know investments. I understand stocks & real estate. I know the value of residual income.

1618 2018-10-14 21:35:12 You make a great point. The best bull markets are led by growth/tech/momentum stocks. Need their leadership
1619 2018-10-14 21:33:45 The lower chart has only world's stocks, while the higher chart has both stocks and bonds.
1620 2018-10-14 21:33:44 #FirstMan is truly exceptional. One of the greatest moments in human history so brilliantly portrayed. Gosling gives such a nuanced performance and the direction is stunning. Chazelle's decision to shoot on multiple film stocks completely pays off.
1621 2018-10-14 21:33:25 It’s all tied in right? Interest rates falling fuel debt buybacks leveraging the balance sheets. CEO comp tied to stock performance. Funny thing about leverage it works both ways. Once it starts the great unwind takes place and with it the floor under stocks
1622 2018-10-14 21:32:43 Total current market value of all world's stocks and bonds, charted. Removes the bias of only watching US stock market or something similar.
1623 2018-10-14 21:32:07 The de-trousering was like the final flourish to whatever programme they were filming  how he lived is literally beyond me  (I also have major horrors about the thought of being in stocks and falling face first like that- not being able to stop yourself Jesus!!)
1624 2018-10-14 21:32:03 The epitome of getting old is finding a deep interest in buying and trading stocks. And I'm there.
1625 2018-10-14 21:32:00 With premium bonds you are losing money unless you get very lucky. better buy a house or put it in a stocks and shares ISA.

1630 2018-10-14 21:29:40 None of that will happen if the Dems get control of the House. All those investigations will be replaced by investigations into Trump's tax returns, Kavanaugh's impeachment, and obstruction of the MAGA agenda. Stocks will TANK.
1631 2018-10-14 21:28:58 Ameritrade buy stocks short but a bond for your 50 y/o self, invest in a farm or restaurant
1632 2018-10-14 21:28:35 Agree @economisms .  The penny stocks in this space are still “behaving”.  When the penny stocks, like $mphmf start moving - that is when the bubble has started.

1636 2018-10-14 21:25:44 #MorganCreekCapital I enjoyed the recent @MarkYusko interview on CNBC. Yusko is probably correct. Stocks are poised for a 40%+ correction. However, I don't believe it will happen because central banks use the stock market as a policy tool and a measuring device. #Stocks
1637 2018-10-14 21:23:32 Hello Pol. BREAKING: Britain has stocks of bobble-hat bobbles for one mild winter - only. A harsh winter will see people trapped in their homes (unheated as heat is sourced in EU) and dying like flies. FLIES IN RIDICULOUS BOBBLE-FREE HATS!
1638 2018-10-14 21:23:16 Russian sources that had ties to the Russian Conglomerate that bought controlling stake in 20% of US uranium stocks. Then Bill Clinton was paid $500K for a speech to Russian Politically tied Oligarchs and Russian Financial Persons.

1647 2018-10-14 21:17:26 #DJIA What happens when the rules change and the US Federal Reserve is allowed to buy stocks for its own account? Does the Dow go to 100K? Will the Fed even allow a correction greater than 20%? #Stocks
1648 2018-10-14 21:15:44 I don’t mind paying high taxes for my country ONLY and wake up stocks are at an all time high and the economy is the best it’s ever been
1649 2018-10-14 21:14:45 #DJIA The stock market is nothing but a policy tool used by central banks to stimulate economic growth. The Swiss National Bank owns a gazillion shares of US equities. Seriously, is a 50% stock market correction even possible in this environment? #Stocks
1650 2018-10-14 21:14:32 That's two days in the stocks 
1651 2018-10-14 21:13:53 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
1652 2018-10-14 21:11:50 trade stocks or buy things and sell them at a higher price
1653 2018-10-14 21:09:55 @LizAnnSonders 81 year old Schwab customer now pairing down equities and increasing fixed income now at 70 % fixed and rest stocks and funds. Markets beginning to make my old nerves rattle a little.
1654 2018-10-14 21:08:57 Will everyone STOP saying bonds and stocks are not correlated. They have been for 200 years. Go see what happens if the 30 year bond goes to 6 percent. Do you really think the SPX will have a 18 P/E ?
1655 2018-10-14 21:08:30 I will switch back from stocks to crypto if I get this
1656 2018-10-14 21:08:27 This is not the time to be having rift at all.This is the time to be united as one.Don't make us laughing stocks to those good for nothing empty headed buharists.

1658 2018-10-14 21:06:40 It's not just H&M. I'm trying to find a pink shirt (going as Dr Ellie Sattler for Halloween, obvs) and no where stocks things by item?? I got confused and left. Bought the Buffy shirt and Deadpool 2 instead

1661 2018-10-14 21:05:13 Aussie shares appear set to dip at the open. In contrast, US stocks rallied over the weekend. After being hammered during the two-day sell-off last week, they rebounded as some strategists expected. #market #saving #invest #money $RZI #morning #ASX
1662 2018-10-14 21:04:47 I was almost alone 20 yrs ago, arguing against peak oil myth, all that happens, is as existing stocks start peaking, it gets more valuable, so technology gets developed and it gets cheaper again. There are about 300 yrs of oil in coal desposits etc etc
1663 2018-10-14 21:04:27 The answer they asked a group of billionaires what was most important to there success all answered the same, Focus. If poor focus, hard work and Financial literacy. Stocks read financials & take risk especially when young.
1664 2018-10-14 21:02:32 But all those stocks were publicly traded with reported prices & dividends. The indexes just report the cumulative results. S&P 500 fund didn’t exist in investable format for first few years either. I wouldn’t ignore this important data for that reason.
1665 2018-10-14 21:02:26 Yes but let them keep their guns. They think the government cant take over their country but little do they know, they are being taken over anyway by so much lies twitter, media and more cover up. These people are taking from you with laws for the rich, stocks, shell companies

1670 2018-10-14 20:55:14 the more i watch smash ultimate the more i love the pacing the game has

it's fast, people lose stocks quickly but like.... not in an explosive way? It's interesting, I really like it
1671 2018-10-14 20:54:22 Do I think the low for the market is in. Nope! Will take weeks of consolidation and back filling. But with that said on a % basis I think most of the damage has been done! Some stocks have been taken to the woodshed! Sit at or below 400 emas. All about valuations now! Earnings!
1672 2018-10-14 20:54:17 Wonder is it smart to cash out on stocks to pay my last CC
1673 2018-10-14 20:52:23 Keep calling these people out. Shaming them will scare others!  It’s like putting people in stocks at the village square. Everyone sees you ugly!
1674 2018-10-14 20:50:26 tfw you blow up your account on "penny stocks"
1675 2018-10-14 20:49:56 I would get out of debt,start an "at-home-based-business, invest in real estate, /stocks, travel the world,& remodel my home, go to the spa & eat at my favorite restaurants!  
1676 2018-10-14 20:48:32 If you don’t mind me asking, how did you learn to trade options or stocks in general. Any books or websites to start learning?
1677 2018-10-14 20:48:11 @RealCandaceO
The reality is 1-in-2 Americans have little, if anything, in the stock market. A once-every-three-years study by the Federal Reserve Board found that in 2016, only 51.9 percent of families owned any stocks, either directly or as part of a fund.
1678 2018-10-14 20:46:06 I work 60 hours a week, go to the gym, research my stocks and the stock market, and still work on my website. My mind is right

1688 2018-10-14 20:37:32 I see a retest likely around 2700 level in coming days but, options market are not that bearish for Indexes as well as the stocks, hence I expect a retest and then a bounce to 2800 later in the week. IMHO. It's going to be another wild and volatile week, great for nimble scalper

1690 2018-10-14 20:34:49 ......... bought back their own stocks and laid off some of their workers. The other corporations pocketed the money which means offshore accounts and also means no taxes being paid from them. So we recently passed the largest military budget.......
1691 2018-10-14 20:34:21 SMART MONEY:  Is selling stocks and buying protection (Stocks Puts) to protect themselves against a stock market decline (VIX was up 50% last week).  Passive Investors should consider protection against the upcoming massive stock market crash
1692 2018-10-14 20:34:04 Made them more money--lower taxes for the wealthy, more money in stocks--which is ALL they care about.
1693 2018-10-14 20:33:50 You can't buy stocks with $1 at the outset. Broker accounts usually want at least a $1k that you can risk losing. More if possible.

That stocks list at $1 does not mean you can just grab a share by skipping your morning coffee once.
1694 2018-10-14 20:32:55 Not really!! Closed by almost 3% down which is very common and completely moving along with world wide earlier drop of global stocks. Sorry but has nothing to do with any feat of sanctions.
1695 2018-10-14 20:31:43 The landlord won't care what the stock is worth in ten years if you spend next month's rent on stocks today.
1696 2018-10-14 20:31:43 I spend $20 a month to buy stocks on STASH.  My measly few stocks sure took a nosedive.  Ouch.  But yeah ... groceries, gas ... everything is going up.
1697 2018-10-14 20:31:27 I bought stocks in 09, cashed out in 17.  my strategy is simply... buy when dems are in office, sell when they're not.  This time I made about 140%... waiting for the next turn.
1698 2018-10-14 20:31:16 Just take the L. You’re stanning pilgrims who would joyfully put you in stocks for not going to church to attack someone who is. I’m sure you have a point, but you aren’t making it

1706 2018-10-14 20:16:49 It happened last week on $ rh, as you know, 4 a trade only, but it is unlikely I would buy Tesla

1707 2018-10-14 20:14:46 I'm skeptical of any punishment on Bin Salman, as this will affect oil price, military stocks and  investment from  ( Saudi Fund ). Trumps worries are purely business and strategic. That has always been American Policy!!

I hope they act on this though!!

1713 2018-10-14 20:09:30 Then there's the issue with taxes. This narrative that Trump lowered taxes for the rich is deceptive. He lowered taxes for those who are invested in stocks, but at the same time raised taxes on the highest tax bracket (which I vehemently oppose) and closed loopholes (I support).
1714 2018-10-14 20:09:21 Aw cmon - do you guys have stocks in Kleenex?? Thanks for heads up on this so I can resupply for tomorrow!! You folks are amazing!!

1719 2018-10-14 20:03:34 For sure all I was saying was I like this set-up more long into earnings. There will absolutely still be guide downs but many of these stocks have already come down hard so will be instructive to see how they react. Banks sure act like ass!

1723 2018-10-14 20:00:46 India is a growth market. We need to educate more people to invest in stock market, mutual funds to start with and then slowly building a portfolio of quality stocks. Definitely this will boost economy overtime and will build wealth for individuals.

1749 2018-10-14 19:47:18 It's bad for U.S. car purchasers, bad for car makers/workers, bad for those affected by inflation (tariffs cause inflation).  Also bad because GDP shrinks w/tariffs, so ultimately all companies suffer, as do stocks/pensions/retirement plans.

I've come to really rely on that delivery thing.
1770 2018-10-14 19:33:44 Imagine Cotton or Graham as SecDef. its probably going to be a good time to buy weapon producing company stocks?
1771 2018-10-14 19:33:43 Do the Saudis have a lot of USD invested with US banks and equities? To more safely allow them the option of implementing the threat of selling oil for CNY,  my guess is that money will be leaving the US ASAP. Doesn't bode well for US stocks IMHO.
1772 2018-10-14 19:32:28 Prince Mohamed bin Salman is able to shut-up @realDonaldTrump, because, it is Saudi Arabia that owns the Stock Market, not @POTUS as he has been bragging about. See how easy it was for the Kingdom to collapse Stocks last week.
1773 2018-10-14 19:32:23 You getting moved up pal? Stocks?!
1774 2018-10-14 19:32:03 is that why you have no stocks
1775 2018-10-14 19:31:55 Stocks are only being held up by corporate buybacks using  their tax scam dollars. They will not be able to maintain these levels for much longer. The housing market is dropping,  interest rates are up,  pay is stagnant,  prices are increasing,  layoffs are

1785 2018-10-14 19:17:30 Interesting Data Point:

1786 2018-10-14 19:16:43 ME TOO. I NEED IT SO BAD :( I also want a t-shirt or something to remember the tour by ;( but if they really sell everything on the 16th that'll be really shitty of them. I think (I HOPE) they're smart enough to have seperate stocks or whatever I can call it

1793 2018-10-14 19:13:27 Even with so much diversity and pressure on myself and family, I truly love Penny stocks. I wrenched professionally on autos, using the latest scan tools and scopes. pico, not anymore. It's like one big family with learning. I truly find real meaningful joy in this.
1794 2018-10-14 19:11:23 There is a big difference between technical analysis that makes us feel better by explaining why stocks are up or down on any given day and technical analysis that helps us stay invested with the primary trend. 

Neither is right or wrong, just significantly different objectives.

1797 2018-10-14 19:09:55 In 2010 when I left SEARS the stocks were at almost $99 a share. I sold mine.
Today their stock is at 40 cents a share.

1799 2018-10-14 19:08:15 What broker do you use to short? HL won't let me short and a few AIM stocks I'd like to short!
1800 2018-10-14 19:08:13 Just finished my weekend process (been doing it for 39 yrs) reviewing large numbers of tech stocks (79 currently). Even though I'm involved with markets every day I was shocked how much damage has been done to tech stocks. 22% of these techs hit 52-week lows over past few days
1801 2018-10-14 19:08:00 Precisely why it was a bad strategy to throw every guy at LA early.
1802 2018-10-14 19:07:23 Perhaps it's instructive to view the "time to panic" as being too late, hence the panic? If positioned to react in a way that takes advantage of panic does that not serve them better? When panic sets in or mania for that matter you get a "stock market" not a market of stocks.
1803 2018-10-14 19:05:57 And from what I'm hearing, their stocks have been taking a HUGE hit over this.
1804 2018-10-14 19:03:24 We at Myntra believe in providing great deals and discounts. However, discounted price on our range is limited till the stocks last. So do keep an eye out for them!

1805 2018-10-14 19:02:07 I really do not know why people are so obsessed with financial analysts commenting on #crypto. Their job is fortune telling. They mostly do not get it right on IT tech stocks and there is huge amount of input on that. So all they say is pure speculation without input or knowledge
1806 2018-10-14 19:02:04 It's true bro, slow and steady value stocks. Buying an asset at a discount and patiently waiting for full value to be realized. Ben Graham style

1808 2018-10-14 19:00:06 @Teresa159Harris(555),
@Sara59703838, I would sell all off my U.S. stocks and invest in the UAE. I would invest in Emaar,  they are building in Africa, still doing things in the UAE. I hope I answered your question, that is what I would do. I would invest in the Arab women.

1812 2018-10-14 18:59:04 One of the myriad skills I will bring to my next lab will be my obsessive dedication to rearranging the stocks of media so that the ones that will expire soonest are at the front of the fridge.

1814 2018-10-14 18:56:33 Jimmy, get your money out of stocks ASAP. Or u can wait for the first rebound to get $ out. Many ways to make $ in a bear market, like bond gold dollar and future, just not in stocks. Trump economy will be F Ed soon.

1817 2018-10-14 18:52:27 I have never owned gold as it is a non-productive asset while stocks theoretically at least are producing profits or expected future profits. But at least gold is tangible. Crypto is not only a non-productive asset, it is also a make-believe pseudo asset.
1818 2018-10-14 18:51:41 Hi Marcus, I have checked the stocks in stores near you. It seems that we stopped selling our red grapefruit. I am sorry about this. (1/2)
1819 2018-10-14 18:51:29 Stop w/ the lies/deceit to rile up your base & to continue on with your BS self-centered narrative - you have no legitimate plans/policies. Costs are spiralling out of control due to the trillion dollars being added to the deficit by your tax cuts/tarriffs/decrease in stocks.
1820 2018-10-14 18:49:16 @edevlin77 could be possible we know these stocks go now days
1821 2018-10-14 18:48:40 Woww. 
Where do you focus your attention to select stocks? ATH and high volume? Fundamentals are important in your trading, too?
1822 2018-10-14 18:48:27 So, does that mean since I bought one, I have stocks in BoneyPlays™?
1823 2018-10-14 18:47:49 America has always been great. It was better before Trump. Our climate will get worse, because of the roll back.  We are in a trade war. Stocks are plunging. He backs sexual predators. He will let Saudi get away with murder. America has never been so divided. So what’s great?
1824 2018-10-14 18:45:43 Many don’t watch what’s going on, if so it’s FOX or FB that pushes propaganda. The ppl that I know that have $ look at their stocks, nothing else. Then u have FAKE Christians. Gun lovers that don’t care about anything else & believe their Guns will be taken away. It’s sad.
1825 2018-10-14 18:45:26 if you are not in the market the market laws do not apply to you. journalists will not be punishable by SEC for misleading information unless they are spreading information regarding stocks they cover or are doing it for someone who does and you need to prove the link.

Everyone should be able to vote from their computer or cell phone just as we file our taxes, manage our bank accounts, trade stocks, etc...

1894 2018-10-14 17:46:50 This happens in the Medici world too. OTC stocks - penny stocks - non traded REITS, private placements caveat emptor reigns. The brazen boiler room tactics are the issue, not the product ?#cryptocurrency #blockchain #crypto #bitcoin
1895 2018-10-14 17:46:40 Agree on disclosures. People age differently.  I have a grandfather-IL lived to 99. His position was appointed under 4 presidents including JFK. He politics, stocks & law until a few months before he passed.  Not saying we need a 99 yr old pres. My dad is 74 and sharp as a tack.

1898 2018-10-14 17:45:38 Can support your argument that stocks have been sensitive to inflation expectations? 

If anything, stocks sold off more to the vertical move and technical breach of 3% for 10Y.
1899 2018-10-14 17:43:13 "diverting food stocks away" as in for allied soldiers, instead of the Indians, not properly administering India and leaving it in a state along with disease, crop death etc. 

Yes, there was some natural causes but the British administration was almost non existent.
1900 2018-10-14 17:42:27 Swede here Ken... You're really contrarian in that paper, if you didn't already know that. Can't remember last time someone wrote you should buy in the middle of a correction in that paper :) It's only why stocks fall (if you want to know, it's the high oil price! look out!!)
1901 2018-10-14 17:41:41 Check out just one lap to learn about ETFs. Other sources easy equities and etfsa. This is investing in stocks
1902 2018-10-14 17:39:05 As for the Bengal famine, food stocks was not diverted the famine was caused by nature. The criticism was the failure by Churchill not to send food to Bengal when there was plenty available.
1903 2018-10-14 17:38:41 The top 1% pay 39% of taxes for US.  The majority of the 1% pay 39.5 % on income and sometimes more if self employed. I cannot find the stat, but it’s the uber wealthy of 1% (Bezos, Trump, Buffet) that have loopholes because of RE, trusts & stocks. Up to $75k plays 15% of income.

1905 2018-10-14 17:38:09 As a teacher, I can tell you that common sense gun laws extend beyond bump stocks and existing laws. We need accountability laws for adults that do not properly store their guns and the child has easy access (which in my case happened by a child with no malicious intent).
1906 2018-10-14 17:36:50 Profits go to the stockholders. Not all Ford or GM stocks are owned by Americans.
1907 2018-10-14 17:36:23 ...that enable high casualty counts like bump stocks, high capacity magazines, etc.

Essentially, treat guns like motor vehicles.  Try to weed out the bad drivers from the good.

1917 2018-10-14 17:29:08 Saudi Stocks Crash Most
 
Saudi Arabia warned on Sunday it would respond to any "threats" against it as its stock market crashed the most since 2016 after President Trump's warning of "severe punishment" over the disappearance of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi.
1918 2018-10-14 17:28:49 The apartheid divestment movement was effective. Civil service retirement funds, university endowments, and many more took to ethics-testing where they put their money. Led to abandoning tobacco stocks too. 

But they were beholden to publics who cared. VC's? Much less so.

1928 2018-10-14 17:21:12 Diverting food stocks away from India to support Britain ultimately killing 4 million Indians, being active in nearly every theatre across the world, from UK to Japan, without India, Britain wouldn't have survived either war.
1929 2018-10-14 17:20:11 Yes! We need universal background checks, elimination of loopholes, ban bump stocks, high capacity mags & assault-style weapons. Guns of war have no place on our streets.

1931 2018-10-14 17:19:14 The best business advice I have ever heard is that don't play the penny stocks.
1932 2018-10-14 17:19:12 But there were stocks that do very well in that environment. I traded IIN, AAXN, HFC etc when market formed a base in February-March
1933 2018-10-14 17:18:50 Sales can be sometimes a rip off when the sell overpriced bad quality things on sale. But you should get it, usually they get huge stocks during this time of the year.
1934 2018-10-14 17:18:27 Mr. Stelter, you are on the right track discussing Fox news. Find out who’s on the board, who owns huge amount of stocks, and their beliefs. Something is very wrong with FOXNews.
1935 2018-10-14 17:18:07 then bitfinex is lagging thats means huge move in bitcoin :) it is always like that this time huge move to the upside because stocks will be propped up next week if I'm wrong all money will go gold silver and we have crisis then it is game over :)

1944 2018-10-14 17:09:55 I wouldn't start market-timing. I'd only lighten up on stocks if you've discovered your risk tolerance is less than you imagined.
1945 2018-10-14 17:08:58 No. You're not. You're really not. Invest in stocks & shares. Bet on a horse. Same thing. No entitlement. It's all a gamble.

1950 2018-10-14 17:07:28 If you were rattled by last week's decline, clearly you've misjudged your risk tolerance -- and it would be prudent to cut back on stocks.

2 - Go through your portfolio & see if they need to be reshuffled and wait for the tide to turn.

1970 2018-10-14 16:52:22 I told you about Jim Koch selling.  This is not a liquid stock.  I knew the small shares he was selling would dramatically effect the price.  Insider sells in very liquid stocks don't really matter, but small volume stocks is different.  You have lots to learn bro.
1971 2018-10-14 16:52:14 These are not unique stocks, I know u have put the source 
But this is not data about unique stocks
It just adds the number of stocks across schemes without de-duplicating
Just for example Motilal holds actually has around 61 unique stocks across all schemes
1972 2018-10-14 16:52:05 That’s a good idea. And I guess it would come off as wanting to see their money, but yeah. I really would just ask about the companies they chose and why. But you’re right, stocks are the only things they could have.

1991 2018-10-14 16:39:08 STOCK MARKET CRASH:  Many analysts are predicting a stock market crash because 1) trump's trade wars, tariffs. 2) 20% decline in China stocks 3) higher inflation (oil, interest rates).  It would be great if it happened before the Midterms.  republicans would lose supporters.

What DA does for bts is manage some events and some networking. So Sm is not involved.

2012 2018-10-14 16:20:35 True, but you get also substantial potential risk. When US president tweet of (severe punishment) you can't look for undervalued stocks '' calmly''. Similar to 1990s when real estate was dirt cheap but country was in war.

Get top gain/loss from NSE website everyday or stick to some stocks (say personal favorites) and trade them or by following news in media ?? 

This is my main confusing point.
2015 2018-10-14 16:15:50 You know music is trash and people have low standards now when we have people like Lil Pump and 6ix9ine running round in the main stream. I remember when Soulja Boy and Nicki Minaj were the laughing stocks of the main stream and they are no where near as bad as these two clowns

2018 2018-10-14 16:15:03 Good stuff Martin.  Recently started demo trading smaller cap US stocks. Liquidity is insane compared to AIM and well suited for intra day and swing trading. Scanners are key though.
2019 2018-10-14 16:13:07 So, would you keep these stocks in your shorting list or wait for for the short covering to go long, since lot of shorts have already been build up ?

2022 2018-10-14 16:09:53 I hear $MSFT is 90% over-valued, if that's the case you gotta wonder how overvalued other less established tech stocks are.
2023 2018-10-14 16:09:44 I bet #RickScott, while he’s done nothing but *blah-blah* for our beloved brave veterans, HAS seen his own bank account and stocks portfolio grow like Jack’s beanstalk! Like all GOPs, he’s lining his own pockets, not serving the common American, even our vets.

2027 2018-10-14 16:09:02 I predicted this market drop that's why I alerted to buy $TVIX it goes up while market goes down. Exploded +75% in a few days
This is not the time to park your money into known stocks and wait for 5% 10% upside in a year. U need much better & safer strategy like ours for example

2029 2018-10-14 16:08:47 I'd say they already have and that trend will continue. However if Saudi's stocks continue to slump, you might see the Saudi Royal Family ditch MBS as being more costly than useful.

I've often wondered if wealthy news reporters or pundits--not to mention the corporate heads and owners--lean GOP because they gain from tax cuts, have so much money (i.e. in stocks) themselves. @AliVelshi is a money guy
2041 2018-10-14 16:02:24 Who stocks this?
2042 2018-10-14 16:01:01 @Nouriel you are simply fighting a battle you cannot win. Unlike stocks, cryptocurrencies cannot be stopped. They are the bubble that in unpoppable- they will simply inflate & deflate in cycles. But never pop
2043 2018-10-14 16:00:01 Tax cuts overwhelmingly catered to the 1%, basically Trump and his friends. 

Majority of Americans aren't invested in stocks. 

But good job on parroting talking points for the ultra rich and powerful, so they can maintain their control over you.

2047 2018-10-14 15:58:05 I am going to buy stocks in whatever companies make those large protest signs. The Democrats did actually create jobs for the sign manufacturers :)... it is so nice for the Democrats to support small business like that ;)

2050 2018-10-14 15:55:28 Radical LEFT Dems ignorance is bliss!  AR is not assault rifle and bump stocks do not help you shoot better, actually makes gun jerky and harder to control, nobody I know even uses one.  Criminals do not care about laws and will get there hands on a weapon no matter what.

2060 2018-10-14 15:48:47 $BTC break out by EOY theory: people liquidating stocks at the top, taking any loses for tax write-off balancing, avoiding 30-day wash-trade buy back of stock, moving cash to crypto exchanges to buy bitcoin before the next recession. Might see surge in $XAU via $GDX / $GDXJ too.
2061 2018-10-14 15:48:21 winningtech: also note that there are far fewer U companies today than back then. There are only I believe 60 or so U miner stocks left today. This is a recipe for explosive gains ahead.

2069 2018-10-14 15:45:54 Every time I see Larry Kudlow talk on TV with the WH in the background I expect at the end for him to give a disclaimer like he used to on CNBC that he has no positions in the stocks or markets he has weighed in on. Silly really since now he does.
2070 2018-10-14 15:44:00 Extra money in folks' pay? Wages have gone down under Trump. Many folks with full time jobs still need SNAP! Most folks at mid income level don't own stocks. And none of the econ indicators are anything more than a continuation of trends under Obama.

2094 2018-10-14 15:26:21 FACTS:
- You can hold a fundamentally good asset, but you still lose money ; You can also be holding a fundamentally bad asset, but you make money.
- Stop thinking on fundamentals. Focus on Price Action & Risk Management.
- Dont Trade if you cannot stomach risks.

2095 2018-10-14 15:26:10 You are completely missing the point. Money is not created out of thin air in the stock market. For every seller there is a buyer who pays with cash. Money destined for stocks may go into AAPL, or it may go in other companies, or both. The INDEX value is net $ amount invested.

2110 2018-10-14 15:19:44 @RepDonBacon, I am watching you on Chronicle, how do you propose to weed out the 1% of the people who should have their 2nd amendment rights restricted? Do you wait until they have committed a mass shooting? Who needs bump stocks? How do you propose to fix Social Security?
2111 2018-10-14 15:19:33 You’re digging in here? Try this: if you knew positively that AAPL would be down -10% next year while all other S&P stocks were all up +10%, would you still index? Or would you perhaps short AAPL to negate it’s assured negative impact?
2112 2018-10-14 15:18:42 Do you expect a green market this week? I hope week of trench stocks will send us in red... but banks probably made a nice protists
2113 2018-10-14 15:18:26 Definitely meant BEAR arguments. It’s logical that stocks come off of nosebleed valuations but until that share buyback liquidity is exhausted it’s unlikely logic wins out

And now $MLHC...
Definitely not ashamed about talking negatively about this list. They all ended up the same. Lots of investors screwed. $MLHC will be joining that list.
2115 2018-10-14 15:17:51 Many safeguards don't infringe on the 2nd amendment: universal background checks, eliminate bump stocks, raise legal age, limit amounts of gun purchases (Vegas shooter bought 55 guns in one year!).

2118 2018-10-14 15:16:06 I have numbers. We are flat. GDP is giving life to inflation as interest rates go up and tech stocks are slumping from lower demand. It’s all relative. Obama tried to tell you. Can’t mess with one side and not effect the other side.

2127 2018-10-14 15:10:06 That billion dollar company has shareholders they have to pay profits to...and those shareholders are everyday men and women who own stocks or have 401ks.  Someone who runs a cash register does not deserve $45k/year.  They just don’t.

2130 2018-10-14 15:08:51 Cdn market place is COMPLETELY different than US. In Canada it is way easier to make a living selling mutual funds than stocks or ETFs. It is w easier to get licensed, less PD credits needed, less prof fees, almost no liability, clients hardly see fees & no fault of funds fall.1/

2132 2018-10-14 15:08:20 $2 mil = rounding error for Monster. Why would they want any negative suit publicity around their own event  It’s worth every bit of the $2M for the extra fan interest. Remember, Monster out-performed all NASDAQ stocks for 15 straight years selling sugar water $$$$$
2133 2018-10-14 15:07:33 Yes. Incredibly hard to find value in this market. Defensive stocks presenting value are TR, HSY and GIS

2135 2018-10-14 15:06:31 This past week’s sharp drop in stocks followed Treasury yields’ breakout above their previous highs for the year, with the benchmark 10-year note surging as high as 3.231% on Oct. 5 and the 30-year bond also hitting 3.405%.
2136 2018-10-14 15:05:41 You are missing the math. More money won't be created in the stock market if AAPL goes 10% per year rather than down -5% per year because the net amount invested in stocks universally will not change. It's finite amount. One company gets big; the others do not grow as fast.
2137 2018-10-14 15:05:15 Why do I have a feeling that the funny episode of purge !when. They show stocks crashing and American US citizens been laying off from steel companies will really happen in here . Because of this trade war uprise prices ! Umm .
2138 2018-10-14 15:04:16 The both of them were worth more than 100,000.

2141 2018-10-14 15:03:07 Consumer spending is still strong, in spite of inflation. Foreign investors are now not buying stocks. Trade wars are also spiking prices. Paychecks not keeping up. Trump emptied out the Fed to pay for tax cuts. Soon, consumers will cut back. Economic storm is coming.
2142 2018-10-14 15:02:48 About 23 more days to the election.  When the stocks dropped the dems pounced on that but it didn't work.  I'm betting they'll come up with something else.  They're desperate.  BEWARE.
2143 2018-10-14 15:02:22 This means more jobs for Americans, right?
Isn't this what everyone wants? According to MSM and politicians?
More jobs?

2149 2018-10-14 14:59:04 To give you a context @Raghav_Bahl  invested in a penny stock of a defunct company that rose 1700 times.
Doesn't this smell fishy and a case of money laundering ?
Round tripping of money via penny stocks that are manipulated.
Whom are you fooling @Raghav_Bahl  ?
2150 2018-10-14 14:58:40 Strongest economy. Maybe you don’t own stocks cause the people on Wall Street aren’t so confident. You can stimulate a full employment economy by borrowing money but when you do you balloon the debt and deficit which is why rates are rising and the bond vigilantes took over.

2152 2018-10-14 14:58:05 @M2JaspreetSingh I have a video idea. How are you prepping for another potential/imminent financial collapse? Does it go beyond portfolio diversity (owning stocks, real estate, etc.)? Like, do you have a special savings account for 2-3 years expenses or something?
2153 2018-10-14 14:56:46 $vyst So, i make a post on ihub about shorts not really being a thing on penny stocks and that bashers will bash. It gets deleted lol. Stupid ihub, it just makes me chuckle everytime I go back there.

2155 2018-10-14 14:55:59 We're not in wartime. We're not in a financial crisis. So, why does America have to bankroll the rich when there's plenty of tax revenue? Many of them used that money to buy back their own stocks! Some gave bonuses. Trickle down economics is pee-pee.
2156 2018-10-14 14:55:44 So do you trade in cash or f&O bro?

2164 2018-10-14 14:48:44 Good thing he had a Nobel prize to sell. Most people don't.  You must have stocks and bonds, because you praise this economic mess and want more cuts in taxes to capital-intensive resources. The other 98% doesn't own wealth and need health care leadership.

2200 2018-10-14 14:17:47 The stock market is in a bubble similar to housing before the last recession. When this bubble bursts it will be as bad or worse because of the over-valuation and prices of stocks, driven up by corporate buy-backs due, ironically, to the extra money they have from the tax scam.
2201 2018-10-14 14:17:17 If u take ALL stocks from nifty, nifty next 50 & nifty mid100 on Google sheets & check price CAGR of previous 6 years, some true gems can be seen.

2206 2018-10-14 14:14:04 Absolutely..very good presentation..and most of these points echo with Phil Fisher on 'When to Sell' in his book Common stocks and uncommon profits...

But why shouldn't people be allowed to sell too cheaply or buy too expensively, if they want?

2266 2018-10-14 13:30:52 Maybe Walmart only stocks products that might sell to their casual customer? 

Retail is business. It's not a show of support.

2268 2018-10-14 13:30:13 mutual funds will fall along with it coz they hold the similar stocks that will be sold if one redeems etf. index fund is nothing but a mutual fund.
2269 2018-10-14 13:30:12 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
2270 2018-10-14 13:28:03 VRNG WAS ONE OF MY FIRST STOCKS THAT I REALLY PLAYED WITH FOR ANY lenth of time, cost me , BUT learned a few things , SLOWLY
2271 2018-10-14 13:27:50 Agreed.  The only way to do what I stated is to buy super solid dividend stocks that aren’t going anywhere.
2272 2018-10-14 13:27:46 We want a stable economy that never crashes and anyone can get get into anytime and slowly gain wealth. Stocks should slowly go up if the company does well and the future looks good, and take jumps on great news with no crashing unless the company falls apart.
2273 2018-10-14 13:27:24 Bullshit. You are saying you lost stocks because of trump so somehow your life gotten worse. How then did you lose stocks when stock have continually went up during his presidency? I didn't put words in your mouth, this is what you said. And now you got a letter blaming brexit?
2274 2018-10-14 13:27:02 how would a big index fund be categorized? Asking as govt employee with 457 mostly in stocks and index funds.
2275 2018-10-14 13:25:02 She should have bought Canadian cannabis stocks 
2276 2018-10-14 13:24:35 Well, what happened to all that "winning" he promised us? My taxes aren't lower, gas prices are going up, stocks have been going down. He hasn't done shit but hold rallies and take credit for the economic successes of Obama.
2277 2018-10-14 13:24:00 JOBBER, in law, a person that buys and sells cattle for others. Hence stock jobbers are persons who buy and fell stocks for other persons.
2278 2018-10-14 13:23:51 I think it’s the whales putting on too much weight by eating too many fish. That’s why the fish stocks are down. We have to help the fisherman
2279 2018-10-14 13:22:43 Paper stocks rerating looks highly probable. You can go with 2 approaches either basket or single high conviction.

Some cos:
Yash paper - Subramaniam pick
JK paper - leader
NR aggarwal - Dolly Khanna latest pick

Disclosure : Invested in NR aggarwal 

Take decision wisely!

2281 2018-10-14 13:17:38 So you admit that Norway's partial ownership of Equinor and their selling of oil profits to purchase stocks and divide that money between their budget and a pension system is the means by which they can afford to provide services to everyone which means you admit...

It works
2282 2018-10-14 13:17:35 Government falsifies the inflation by measuring it as change in consumer prices and not as expansion of money supply. This is the main reason that the gap between 0.1% is getting bigger and bigger - most inflation goes into assets, gold, stocks, etc and is not visible in CPI.
2283 2018-10-14 13:17:35 Everyone stop fueling @Nouriel 's trolling.  It's what he feeds on.  This hypocrite supports the system that creates penny stocks which are no different then shit coins and centralized banks.
2284 2018-10-14 13:17:04 It turns out that people that trade stocks and commodities don't pay income tax, they pay capital gains.

2288 2018-10-14 13:10:19 If the American stock market drops 25%, I will shift some money from short-term bonds to stocks.
2289 2018-10-14 13:09:27 These stocks are probably a good buy now. Everybody knows what Trump is going to say:- ' . . . the Saudis say they didn't do it, and I believe them.' Even if shown a video of them doing it, he'll say it's fake (news?), or the killers aren't Saudis, or something of a similar ilk.
2290 2018-10-14 13:04:58 80% of stocks are controlled by 10% of the population.  The top of the economy “invests” in already existing assets, causing asset price inflation the rest of society must pay.  Household debt is way back up.  That’s what matters to households

Why allow stocks to rule prices. Look North...oil comes from North America too!

2296 2018-10-14 12:55:42 That’s why I like Divvy paying stocks. At least CAKE might be saved with Chairman putting in £10million and a potential share issue coming to raise additional funds, but the dividend cover will drop from about 6 to zero. But hopefully it can trade out of difficulties.
2297 2018-10-14 12:55:06 STOs are a fantastic new type of digitization – stocks.  STOs offer more creative ways for startups and listed companies to raise funding beyond ICOs.  Great for regulatory compliance especially dealing with different jurisdictions.
2298 2018-10-14 12:51:52 Thanks a lot bro.. it was really nice talking with u...and i like these stocks personally now.. not recommendation  as i might exit as soon as my stop loss hits...
2299 2018-10-14 12:49:33 TJX parent company of TJ Maxx & Ross stocks trading at $109 & Sears stock is $0.37 is unreal. Amazon for some reason can’t touch Ross & TJ Maxx & it’s fascinating to watch lol

2318 2018-10-14 12:28:23 Yeah well diversifying into international stocks has been poison for returns for years and maybe forever.
2319 2018-10-14 12:28:16 @SenTedCruz supports the @NRA...IE, he wants more not less Semi Automatic weapons on our streets, opposes banning bump stocks, sees gun violence as just acceptable collaterial damage if he can protect the gun industry over saving lives.

2324 2018-10-14 12:20:06 Probably nothing to be investigated. Pelosi’s husband holds commercial real estate & earnings are connected to her husband's heavy investments in stocks including "Apple, Comcast, Facebook, Shutterfly and Walt Disney."
2325 2018-10-14 12:19:47 Switching to Mac is very disruptive. Engineers also struggle for a few days to make the switch. Unless you have some use cases where Mac is proven to be a better alternative, it is better to save your money and precious time by sticking to what  we know. Same as stocks 
2326 2018-10-14 12:18:51 it’s not yet in stock, bc it will be released on oct 22, but i just reserved in national bookstore so that when the stocks arrive, they will prioritize those who reserved 
2327 2018-10-14 12:17:49 But so many stocks will be crossing 20ema/50ema...which one to pick?
2328 2018-10-14 12:17:07 Sana nga marami silang stocks. Alam naman nila na maraming naghahanap ngayon.
2329 2018-10-14 12:14:59 So Andrew what stocks that you currently own fit that criteria ?

2332 2018-10-14 12:12:17 What about our rights that are not equal right now? What about women's rights that the GOP has changed? Common sense guns, we already have. Bump stocks being banned, we need enforcement of existing gun laws and school security. We all care about environmental issues.

2335 2018-10-14 12:08:30 Thanks. Right now I just want to focus on shares only but need a broker who offers a very wide selection of USA and UK shares. My screening method well be more technical than sector specific. I'll ask them if they can confirm how many stocks they cover in each exchange.
2336 2018-10-14 12:07:57 marami pa po stocks don?

2342 2018-10-14 12:02:40 It really depends on what you want to trade. Tasty Trade may be good for you. I personally wanted to be able to trade commodity futures and futures options as well as stocks and stock options. I use schwab currently and they are pretty good for what I need.
2343 2018-10-14 12:00:55 He expanded it by releasing more money by tax cuts. But it's not "better". Corporations are reinvesting their money into their own stocks. Thus inflating the stock market. Meanwhile we're accumulating record debt..by the day. That cant continue.
2344 2018-10-14 12:00:21 My judgement re: #stocks . Market could go up or down from here. Better off waiting/holding. If you have some cash you could average into stocks that you like which are down. Ultimately, if you like your holdings, you are holding anyways.
2345 2018-10-14 11:58:39 Recent Index performance was lead by few stocks where as funds are more diversified. Over a period of time this abnormality will go away !!!

2347 2018-10-14 11:57:03 #StockKlass: thanks for ur question. The best time to invest in #Stocks is when market is significantly cheap. Not only that, you must take cognizance of coys earnings & macroeconomic indicators- these must wear positive outlook. Pls note, market is designed for long term.

2357 2018-10-14 11:47:56 Tadawul cracked 7%. Now 5% trading down and it trades more than oil stocks
2358 2018-10-14 11:43:53 Keep in mind its not an all buy signal for all stocks yet.. there are a number of parabolic momentum names  (nasdaq) that still have a little more downside ahead $QQQ $SPY $DIA $IWM $EEM
2359 2018-10-14 11:43:15 I believe the dollar is going to fall over the next 12 months. The #USD was very weak during the carnage that showed up this week with stocks.

2361 2018-10-14 11:37:49 yes, I checked this link too and I'm really crazy how this #ponzi project plays, it is a really #criminal and #scam. #TRXC should answer all our questions, also about why their CEO makes money with bumping stocks #fraud #scam #AvoidTRXC

2363 2018-10-14 11:36:27 The most important thing to remember about $TSLA isn't that the CEO is a pathological liar (though he is) but that an onslaught of superior competition is coming. Go drive an i-Pace & look at the e-tron, Taycan and Mercedes EQ series, not to buy those stocks, but to NOT buy TSLA

2367 2018-10-14 11:30:40 Can I ask where do you download the data from? I am trying to do similar exercise for few Stocks.
2368 2018-10-14 11:29:44 For sure. The only problem is that silver has become manipulated to a statistically significant degree (I guess it has that in common with BTC).

Idk if it's prop trading or a massive client, but JPM owns the silver market.

2384 2018-10-14 11:15:20 Of course. In order to control it, drama is created - like 911. Btw #Saudi stocks have taken a plunge... now there’s a surprise
2385 2018-10-14 11:15:04 Saudi stocks sank as much as 7% today. That's more than when oil fell below $30/bbl in 2016. The kingdom has responded to Trump's threat to punish the nation if its responsible for Khashoggi's fate with it's own threat. It'll retaliate with an even “stronger” response. Here we go

2390 2018-10-14 11:12:05 To be honest with people I’m not a good back and fourth trader. My specialty comes from narrowing down 2-3 stocks every weekend and focusing on one trade at a time. I’ve done quite well lately with this strategy. Last week was and exception with the volatility.

2429 2018-10-14 10:18:38 Bitcoin price was going south in tandem with the stock price drop was due to its small correlation with the technology stocks in Nasdaq - the Nasdaq index. Having said that, crypto is still treated as an independent asset class.

2442 2018-10-14 09:56:23 One can always trade in and out of stocks.
It should not be mistaken for long term investing. 

The quick money making gives a kick but does not create great wealth. Holding for long, does. 

My average core stock is around 5X to 7X up over last 6 years.

2654 2018-10-14 05:15:53 To be fair to Moseley I did get dragged into a gammon pub. Can't say which one because I'll get put into twitter stocks and pelleted. Hope the youngsters feel differently

2656 2018-10-14 05:13:40 Yes 
Even in large caps mutual funds where all the stocks are in derivatives segment also
There is no hedging by mutual funds.
Reason, they say we are not technical analyst but fundamental analyst 
And who knows when markets can turn. Which will effect their performance if hedged

2662 2018-10-14 05:08:58 It is a big topic, difficult to discuss here.
Hedging by shorting is possible only in F&O stocks.
But most of the money flown to midcap and small cap MF.
They can not do hedging.
Hedging thro' indices also not possible due to the definition of hedging to the extent of underlying.

2665 2018-10-14 05:07:25 It’s a nice to have your Micronation having a wide publicity, but it’s also good to make economic growth as well. Examples include buying stocks, making land leases, growing and selling live stock and crops. These are all why Domolica has grown to be what it is now.

2685 2018-10-14 04:50:20 Your point well taken. The only argument was on value basis the stocks were not suitable recommendations at crazy valuations by value experts in hindsight. Were they momentum picks, then it was a different call and possibly earlier exit too.
2686 2018-10-14 04:46:44 The best time to avoid media and news is when stocks are going down.

2691 2018-10-14 04:40:17 What do you mean by "speculative assets benefit from inflation"? Are you talking about bonds, stocks, metals, property and the like? If so, do you mean that they actually benefit from inflation--or just that they have a better chance of keeping up with it?

2758 2018-10-14 03:01:16 My allocation is 50% bonds 10% cash and 40% dividend paying stocks.  As rates go higher the stock allocation will go lower.  My great fear is that too many people will listen to you and we won't be able to cope with the next crisis.

2787 2018-10-14 02:26:10 Bump stocks are junk, no serious gun advocate, hunter would ever want one.  And he didn’t do anything illegal. That cannot be it, I seriously hope you have more proof showing he’s committed acts that are unconstitutional.
2788 2018-10-14 02:25:41 Edelweiss was a blind buy below 155 mate and Bajaj finance was a blind buy below 2000. They’ve recovered well from the lows and will@keep@giving bounce. These two are the best stocks in their sector in terms of stability and and growth
2789 2018-10-14 02:25:02 I've filled out the forms- I'm sending you back to pre-po stocks and replacing you with a more modern variant.
2790 2018-10-14 02:23:45 tbh tried stocks, up 30 percent, down 30 percent, eh

crypto and political were better

some friends did well in stocks though

hmmm
2791 2018-10-14 02:22:29 Holy Sham Crash Batman-artficially inflating stocks only benefits fat cats like Trump & those manipulating the levers who know before they move the levers what stocks the levers will deflate so they can divest in time-you'd think they'd get global warming but they're just cheats!
2792 2018-10-14 02:21:15 what we invested into it. And, we also PAY 2300.00 Every month for commercial health for 2 of us. We don’t have 401Ks, Stocks....... OBAMA AND DEMOCRATS STOLE OUR RETIREMENT. SO, Until @realDonaldTrump FIXES The theft from the thieves, I won’t be happy. Who’s going to help Us???

2796 2018-10-14 02:14:26 If you feel the urgent need to sell stocks when the market drops – you may benefit from more frequent review of intrinsic value estimates for each stock in your portfolio. If you didn’t estimate intrinsic value in the first place, it may be a good idea to start. #investing
2797 2018-10-14 02:12:46 Maybe they can run em in  street stocks or bombers that way doesn't cost so much when it's a crash fest lol
2798 2018-10-14 02:12:29 Just the opposite.
He knows how corporate corruption impacts the bottom line and sells their stocks short.
2799 2018-10-14 02:12:12 If you believe in @radiogel product & market potential with coming PR push the demand 4 $RDGL stock will surely be there. You formed ur entire reasoning based on what happens with 90% of OTC stocks. #RDGL has a life changer cancer drug, they’re not like ur ave OTC company.  
2800 2018-10-14 02:11:59 Leverage meaning, taking a loan and investing in (hopefully well researched) stocks such that return is greater than the interest you pay?
2801 2018-10-14 02:11:36 As the ratio of deficit/gdp grows it could cause an increase in the yield demanded by bond investors, increase the cost of capital and push stocks down. Might also create a need for more aggressive corporate taxes/fees to pay down that debt. And cuts in all government spending.
2802 2018-10-14 02:11:25 Woah were you the guy sitting at the next table at the bar tonight arguing about marijuana stocks with his friend for most of the third period? Or do great minds just think alike?
2803 2018-10-14 02:10:52 Bunch  of pumpers on these Canadian Marijuana stocks. They will attack anyone that doesn’t believe the stock is going to over 100
2804 2018-10-14 02:10:03 HAPPY BIRTHDAY LO STOCKS!!!  @laura_stockton
2805 2018-10-14 02:08:31 Zalora. They're authentic and got loads of stocks and you might get discounts too.
2806 2018-10-14 02:07:28 You are right, they do not.
Agha's sources them and stocks them, similar to people buying in bulk and reselling
2807 2018-10-14 02:06:41 Not me. I like the fact that I bought Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and others and have large gains in them, more than real estate gains. Plus, more interesting to follow stocks..........plus no vacancy worries.........Peter
2808 2018-10-14 02:06:34 Stocks may be up 26% under Trump -but at this same time under Obama they were up 38%. These educated men are ill informed; they read  headlines but not substance & put their bank accounts before country. Despite rebuking Trumps behavior they like a bully& buy into his phony rage
2809 2018-10-14 02:06:04 Your reminder that Trump said on October 1, one year after Las Vegas massacre, that bump-fire stocks would be banned “over the next couple of weeks.”
2810 2018-10-14 02:05:32 Wonder..... Has that got anothing to do with Tec Stocks falling. Public becoming safe aware.

2813 2018-10-14 01:56:33 Will be my last before I call it quits. Saved enough people enough money and hate to see such ignorant “economists” preach all the wrong things about economics. Hence why I’m on here talking to anyone who wants to listen. Stay away from stocks, bonds & real estate next 2yrs
2814 2018-10-14 01:55:42 ipush man kong mommy aning stocks oy
2815 2018-10-14 01:54:45 Still long few stocks in my retirement account.  5-10 years hold.  Added the dip on some of them.  $GOV $CAT $ZION $GPOR $QCOM $BABA $FB $BIDU etc..
2816 2018-10-14 01:54:39 No I understand the point of her tweet but the facts in the tweet state that she 1. Has 0 understanding about stocks which means she probably doesn’t know much about saving either (maybe) and 2. She’s basing her increase in price on gas and grocery which both vary each time
2817 2018-10-14 01:52:26 This is trading 101 its stocks for dummy’s now some stocks have a lot of O/S and are rated high valuations different factors like share holders dividends stock options and multitude of other stuff affect that but in the OTC it’s very simple high O/S High A/S low pps
2818 2018-10-14 01:50:54 Omg. Hahaha. Dapat madami cla stocks. Gow fren. Sana mkakuha ka ng copy.
2819 2018-10-14 01:50:06 @JimmyKimmelLive the only crazy person here is you! @hereKANYEWEST is telling the truth! Democrats &  #obama did absolutely nothing for the African American community or this country. @POTUS  has done so much for USA you all hate him for it! How are your stocks doing Jimmy?
2820 2018-10-14 01:49:44 Listened to @ambareeshbaliga and @hiddengemsindia in ET and CNBC when I was new in 2011. Sometimes free advice is valuable. It's important how you grasp the important points from them to identify value stocks. 

Learned what not to be done thru SP Tulsian recommendations.
2821 2018-10-14 01:48:55 Yeah it was tricky for sure. The last time I traded $TVIX I lost about $150, so I was determined to make it back, but at the very least I stayed green. TVIX & $SQQQ trades a bit differently than penny stocks, I'm going to nail it one of these days.
2822 2018-10-14 01:48:18 A R/S happens if they add more shares to the A/S market value goes down not up so if radiogel is going to be valued at let say 200mill dollars... the pps will never reach over .01 due to the fact there’s too many shares to drive pps up.... its how stocks work
2823 2018-10-14 01:47:58 Stocks? I’ve had something like 57¢ to my name for two weeks. I’m not kidding. Yea, I can do better, but despite working full time, i have zero leeway for mistakes as my housing costs are 70% to 80% of my $10.00/hour wages, and when I break out, my budget and I pay for MONTHS.
2824 2018-10-14 01:46:07 I ALMOST TWEETED ABOUT CANNABIS AND WEED STOCKS ON MY WORK TWITTER OMG DJDJDJJD

2828 2018-10-14 01:43:00 Por puro miedo o porque el proveedor se cansó de que le paguen a 180D y decidió mandarle las banderas a @CiudadanosCs ...@PPopular  y @vox_es  que han agotado todos los stocks ultimamente...
2829 2018-10-14 01:39:39 if my recollection of my long-ago time in print is correct (i.e. last decade) that stock chart is probably just a few drag-and-drop files, if not a ready-to-go image. And the readers would call if anything was amiss with the stocks, comics, horoscopes or columnists.

2838 2018-10-14 01:29:41 Money left crypto this past week when stocks tanked.  I love crypto’s but same will happen if crisis happens.  It’s no different
2839 2018-10-14 01:27:24 OMW to dump my life saving in pot stocks.
2840 2018-10-14 01:27:01 @Nouriel the market has been correcting long before equities took a dip. Crypto was going finish its correction regardless of what stocks wanted to do. To take one example and make such a bold statment shows your ignorance. Let's see if the same happens during a bull market.
2841 2018-10-14 01:26:25 When I find myself drawing more Fibonacci Retracements than Extensions, it's likely not an environment where stocks are going up.
2842 2018-10-14 01:26:09 LMAO you do know this happened once Henry got added right? The rotation had been stopped when Kyuhyun had gotten added back in 2007, SM even announced that. They bought stocks in 2008 and I even have links to the different discussion boards where korean elfs were asking for help.
2843 2018-10-14 01:26:07 My investments in Apple according to stocks and my time will never be regretted
2844 2018-10-14 01:25:58 She probably did what most corporate owners did, buy back their own stocks to increase their own net-worth and invested offshore.
2845 2018-10-14 01:25:28 I mean it is about that time. They have been calling it for a few years now. Stocks making that drop may be the first signs to tighten up
2846 2018-10-14 01:23:57 The US may have entered a bear phase in a secular bull of several months duration

It's disconcerting that small stocks have really struggled in AUS and now cop it in the cods.

Counterintuitively they may come good during this volatile period.

Just watch and keep an open mind
2847 2018-10-14 01:21:55 Stocks have been going up ever sence he was elected. How then did you lose stocks if they continually went up? Brexit? OMG!! How has your life gotten worse because of Trump? And how has your life got better with Obama? I think I may have an answer.
2848 2018-10-14 01:21:30 $pyx has a low number of shorts compared to over marijuana stocks. $tlry a short squeeze worked because they could manipulate it and control the float. $pyx that isn’t happened.
2849 2018-10-14 01:21:23 84% of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10% of households.   

“For the vast majority of Americans, fluctuations in the stock market have relatively little effect on their wealth, or well-being, for that matter,” said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at NYU.
2850 2018-10-14 01:20:14 I think several other cannabis penny stocks have done quite well. Besides Tinley has an experienced team in the largest cannabis and brand building market in the world. Patience and vision are all one needs here.
2851 2018-10-14 01:19:35 Still counting on our tweets to get you higher ratings. Probably not feasible since you don't listen to the people who got you those in the first place. You want more stocks . I think renewing our show is the first thing you do on Monday.

2855 2018-10-14 01:10:23 Right 
Dumbasses out here buying stocks! Dummies!
2856 2018-10-14 01:10:08 Last week was the first week I didn't give my top growth stocks for the week. Reason was, I didn't have any. I only play when I feel there's money to be made.

$PBR and $PBF

2861 2018-10-14 01:03:40 I just checked my investments and with the dip in the stocks this week I’m down like $4000 bitcccchhhhh
2862 2018-10-14 01:01:14 I’d like a list of all the idiots that bet on Ole Miss at -7. I have some Gordon Gekko level stocks I need to unload.
2863 2018-10-14 01:00:50 “20% of the stocks would create 80% of the wealth. And 80% of the wealth would be created in 20% of time. So have a focused portfolio and be prepared for lumpy returns.”
 - @dmuthuk
2864 2018-10-14 01:00:30 No but Donald Trump and cronies do!  Helps them greatly in influencing the cost of oil, that allows oil companies to make billions, and of course the wonderful politicians that have stocks in oil that can tell what the futures will be doing long in advance.
2865 2018-10-14 01:00:00 War only benefits those who owns stocks in military contractors, the rest of us merely die in them.
2866 2018-10-14 00:59:27 Absolument pas; les vêtements traîne parterre, ou dans des stocks et je peux vous dire en ayant bosser dans le prêt à porter que vos mieux laver les vêtements avant de les porter parce que les conditions dans lesquels ils se trouvent avant qu’ils soit en mag 
2867 2018-10-14 00:54:55 If you’d like, then you can go ahead and order it and they’ll ship once their stocks systems are updated. Might be easier than constantly checking back to see do they have it in stock.
2868 2018-10-14 00:54:37 Anybody got any shares in stocks?
2869 2018-10-14 00:54:23 I dropped considerably the best aviation school in the world. But guess what. I’m still studying in the best private school for stocks/trades in LDN.

don’t listen to celebrities when they talk about politics

think for yourselves

celebrities and rappers are no different than congressmen in the sense that their “beliefs” are bought and sold like stocks
2874 2018-10-14 00:49:47 I think a big part of it is bonds becoming more attractive, so funds are rethinking the appropriate p/e of stocks
2875 2018-10-14 00:48:55 I Totally support SEC on that
2876 2018-10-14 00:45:20 Loll i been in the game in Feb... purchased at dips.. so not lost much... i guess thats why i am bored... and to scared to go alllll in on crypto.. i hold more stocks
2877 2018-10-14 00:44:07 Something to note: Yes, Bitcoin didn't pump (like gold might do when stocks crash), bút on February 2nd through 6th, SPY went down 7.8%, while Bitcoin dumped 36%, whereas now SPY dumped 6.35%, while Bitcoin dumped 'only' 6.8%! (BITF.) BTC getting less of a risk asset?
2878 2018-10-14 00:42:36 It is, but I think it'd get really old really fast having to do it multiple times per game... I think I'll just stop losing stocks so I don't have to do it

2880 2018-10-14 00:40:04 "In the past year, cannabis stocks outperformed gold, bitcoin, and the broader market."
2881 2018-10-14 00:35:23 That just means the economy is doing too well. 

If you see a restaurant that serves nothing but cold cereal start shorting construction stocks.

2889 2018-10-14 00:21:57 Trying to time the market is a Fools errand. Buy stocks of good companies, hold them when they go up, continue to hold them when they go way down, if you have extra cash buy more when theiy’re down. Don’t look at the value for 20 years and you will have a shit load of money.
2890 2018-10-14 00:21:50 Taking unproven penny stocks’ word for it and you’re going to have a bad time.

2897 2018-10-14 00:12:27 @NRA - Instead of giving @DonnaShalala an “F”, why don’t you give one to yourselves for doing NOTHING to help prevent school shootings, ban bump stocks, etc.  In fact, give yourselves an F-.
2898 2018-10-14 00:12:20 1/Currently watching the next bearish trigger when the Moon conjoins heavy Saturn tomorrow (Sunday) evening. Let's see if there is another small drop.

2900 2018-10-14 00:08:17 Crypto is just like the stocks but lacks regulation. It's one huge difference is that acts as a currency. The issue is that it's a pointless currency unless it is adopted. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of crypto, but the fact is very few develop a market for their own ICO.
2901 2018-10-14 00:07:51 Donald believes the economy is booming when the stock market is cranking out moola for his friends and folks like him.
People I know don't on stocks. The market is a dark unknown place. People I know are trying to figure out the monthly budget on unchanging middle class wages.

2903 2018-10-14 00:04:03 I think it's a good idea. Companies should have to put out fins.
2904 2018-10-14 00:03:59 As in you mean stocks?? Pretty common
2905 2018-10-14 00:03:58 That's just a random number I selected the point is Norway takes that money from oil then invests it in stocks and then uses part of it to finance pretty much everything and they have enough to give back to the people via a pension system. There's a problem here you're not seeing

2908 2018-10-14 00:00:37 1.Well if you're investing in MJ stocks based on revenues and market caps right now, its hard to single out any company that wouldn't be considered overvalued. Its about potential. Especially with startups like Tinley. They're developing something thats never been produced before
2909 2018-10-14 00:00:18 I like that screen it shows weighted stocks where do you get that that is a good tool
2910 2018-10-12 23:58:50 If the firearm was a snub nose revolver I'd agree. 

A Semiautomatic weapon that excerpts detachable high capacity magazines is a potential weapon of mass slaughter & is unnecessary for hunting or self defense. Folding or telescoping stocks make long arms concealable. Unnecessary
2911 2018-10-12 23:58:50 Since sellers have great offers and discounts during the sale, products may run out of stock really quick. In case you like a product, we'd recommend that you buy it while the stocks are available with sellers. Happy shopping. -Aaditya
2912 2018-10-12 23:58:33 How would time value of $ come into play? A $3000 loss carryover doesn't "lose" value vs a non-realized cap loss that you never get to take at all. You can always TLH again in the future (but stocks tend to rise over time so in general TLH gets harder when you wait)
2913 2018-10-12 23:58:30 Economy=job opportunity.  What you do with it is up to you.  Buy an iPad,can’t afford one, get a library card and read books on stocks, oils markets, understand how they work and understand risk/management.  Dividends alone would cut out fluctuation risk.
2914 2018-10-12 23:57:38 You’re right.  People flee risk, and crypto is about as risky as it gets.  Don’t believe me, watch the price action.  When stocks dove, crypto dove more.

2917 2018-10-12 23:54:03 @UN If the working class must make due on low wages and benefits it is wrong to give wealthier people and poorer people government perks that allow them to have more children than is fair when often the rich just live off government perks, stocks and control of business worldwide

What are your thoughts for the U stocks moving higher from here,

- Are we waiting on another significant event - 232,Kazatomprom IPO?
- Should stocks continue to rise slowly with the rising spot?
- Market uncertainty stopping gains?
- Waiting for a higher spot e.g. $30+
2920 2018-10-12 23:46:51 I find weak stocks tend to consolidate during big sell offs. Not sure why, maybe all focused on selling past winners. It’s what makes short selling so tough. Would think selling $TWTR and $TSLA this week would work, not so much
2921 2018-10-12 23:46:39 I think my stocks just went down
2922 2018-10-12 23:46:23 Damn that’s good! But I rarely trade stocks I’m mostly trading SPX and The DAX so the commission is worth it for the amount of leverage you can get
2923 2018-10-12 23:46:05 @pizzahut, put bacon or ham or anything in your stuffed crust and your stocks will soar.

2948 2018-10-12 23:40:07 No I am totally into stocks gold and how it all works! I have been buying gold and silver for years! Just a good way to be diverse.  The Federal Reserves scares me...too much power with no a lot of oversight!
2949 2018-10-12 23:39:29 Being a career publishing pro (like you), the stock market is my only hope of funding my retirement. I do a few ETFs but mostly equities. Hit me up any time you want to chat stocks.
2950 2018-10-12 23:34:31 How do you feel about the three mile limit ? let me guess all for removal of it tories removed it in 1984 inshore fish stocks collapsed . You lot would fish out everywhere with no thought of the future stocks or anyone else creelers ,line fishermen . No sympathy for you .
2951 2018-10-12 23:32:14 And we are off! The Millerstown Pic-A-Part Pro Stocks start off our this years Stampede!
2952 2018-10-12 23:31:41 Anyone in the senate or the congress must sell all of their stocks within 1 week of being elected. As trump has shown, the temptation to pass bills to help themselves is too great. This is common sense and our govt needs to start using common sense.
2953 2018-10-12 23:31:34 So stop compromising. Bump stocks? Really, you caved. Stop it.
2954 2018-10-12 23:30:52 I notice it is all tech stocks dropping, might have something to do with new policies in place at companies, limiting freedom. Also the Fed raised interest rates.
2955 2018-10-12 23:28:19 Best part imo, “all debt was bought to prevent any Dilution” - when a person buys debt its with the expectation of a very healthy return - this can be huge - $eomn

2958 2018-10-12 23:23:23 No offence Nelson but why so much focus on dividend heavy stocks? Do you need income supplements from dividend stocks now? At the end of the day what really counts is total returns. I went through similar path so I know what I feels like adding dividends but it can mislead you.

2980 2018-10-12 23:09:24 Yup that's why stocks are tanking
2981 2018-10-12 23:08:45 I think that’s right, but I think it has to be Main Street stocks, so to speak. That said, autos and homebuilders are already there, and banks and consumer disc already more than halfway. I think the Fed could care less about nasdaq (at least for now).
2982 2018-10-12 23:07:34 The market dip might be a double dipper but can a Christmas rally cover the FED? All I can say is hold your current stocks and buy good companies on the dip.
2983 2018-10-12 23:07:02 You mean the 75 months in a row Obama had of job growth prior to Trump? Oh yes let's ignore that and that he handed him the stocks at 19k

2996 2018-10-12 22:59:34 It's curious why a we see a market crash as apocalyptic. 

-84% of stocks owned by Top 10%

- most Americans do not rely on stocks for their income (at least in the near term)

- US Corporations sitting on almost $2T in cash stockpiles

You'd think we could withstand a crash?

3026 2018-10-12 22:41:07 In a market like this week, not being able to day trade is really bad..I lost money because I couldn't use stop loss when stocks were going down 3-4% a day because your app won't allow me to sell my stocks on the same day..

3029 2018-10-12 22:40:05 A: Paddlefish and Hackleback mature at a much younger age than most sturgeon. They can spawn as early as 2-5 years, because of this the stocks are still healthy in the Tennessee River and we feel comfortable selling this product.

3031 2018-10-12 22:37:30 A few thing I’ve noticed this week 

Turd real asset stocks rallying

Carry continuing to outperform 

Silver holding false total  return breakdown 

EM hold multiyear support 

XME holding Quartely breakout 

...all of which suggest future trend of USD is lower
3032 2018-10-12 22:37:26 The Dow down more 1400 points in two days, worst week in Chinese stocks history. Could be something, probably is nothing but the volatility year long is interesting.

3035 2018-10-12 22:34:53 Whoever is running your social is having a nightmare. Selling Hijabs to 3 year old children is not a good look. The last time I checked a 3 year old cannot object to wearing hijab, so best you pull it before your stocks price plummets
3036 2018-10-12 22:34:43 Heck yes. Took out mortgage on my house to buy stocks.

3042 2018-10-12 22:27:37 Bet you regret selling all of your stocks to me
3043 2018-10-12 22:27:32 A look back at times when the World's stock exchanges have suffered catastrophic collapses will show that most stocks recovered and the exchanges eventually reached new heights. At 90% only stupid people would bail !!

3048 2018-10-12 22:24:47 RT Gil G: When stocks were rising, Trump said it was all him.  Now they're tanking  badly, and suddenly it's all the Fed's fault.  Might all those tariffs  have something to do with it????
3049 2018-10-12 22:23:10 Can y’all make the 3 day wait shorter so when I sell my stocks I can deposit the cash  back in my bank  account?
3050 2018-10-12 22:22:26 Bah non ptdr si personne n’achetait de viande la demande baisserait et donc les stocks aussi, c’est logique l’offre et la demande
3051 2018-10-12 22:20:50 It's not a victory. They're screwing over workers that have been there longer by taking away stocks and bonuses. I'm for supporting raising the minimum wage, but not when it means screwing over dedicated, loyal workers that have put up with that miserable workplace for years.
3052 2018-10-12 22:19:03 We’ve been here before, although I felt slightly different this time! We’ll all hit ath’s again soon and maybe then I’ll consider taking some risk off the table with my more cyclical stocks. Until then I’m relaxed.

Get out of index funds too

If they drop a lot, then the index will follow
3059 2018-10-12 22:15:15 Mr Buffett is heavily invested in BANK STOCKS, so it is his duty to call bitcoin a scam or a ponzi scheme! If bitcoin is ‘rat poison’, then the BANKS ARE THE RATS!! lol

3062 2018-10-12 22:14:06 So from my analysis... I feel we will have 40% to 50% correction, maybe with some minor flash crashes like the one we just had.  I don't think it will be a reset, but I do feel that crypto currency and these new pot stocks will reset like the DotCom.

3066 2018-10-12 22:13:21 @jimcramer Jim - seems ppl ask about and buy stocks like Tesla no matter what you say.  Perhaps coach your followers on how to position it as a spec stock and limit their allocation accordingly when they call in.  They won't take "No." so do the next best thing instead...
3067 2018-10-12 22:12:49 Many producing junior Gold miners have been slaughtered, selling below book, below 2X revs, 1/2 of NAV. Twitter world focused on low cost minersthat are up.

3074 2018-10-12 22:06:38 I was wondering how the market drops affect penny stocks?
3075 2018-10-12 22:04:20 Right some are just created by a lender, sometimes insured...

Interest, loans & stocks should be illegal.
I know cars would be cheaper if no one got it loaned, & no one could get spending capital from lending.

People should raise money from decaying royalty agreements or labor.

3082 2018-10-12 21:58:53 That’s why invest in stocks which have a PPT to bail us out and not in metals. Lol.
3083 2018-10-12 21:58:37 dude, I just caught into stocks! you should try trading penny stocks, I made like $1000 so far
3084 2018-10-12 21:58:03 Update: Starting next week, I will be focusing on trading stocks under $1 (OTCs included). I will be sizing up on these positions and honing in on having a "stock sniper" mentality. 

The goal is to turn $2,550 from the start of October 2018 to $25,000 by the end of May 2019.

As volatile $CTL is a prime example.

3091 2018-10-12 21:52:29 To me it looks as if U stocks are waiting for the next big sector wide catalyst before taking again? (Maybe a decision on Section 232)
What are your thoughts?
3092 2018-10-12 21:51:29 It seems U stocks have come down off highs after the first real "hype" driven run and are looking a little stagnant, especially in these market conditions.
3093 2018-10-12 21:51:11 The Erdogan narrative is not simply geopolitical machinations vis a vi KSA in the ME, but also economic,  moving markets - energy stocks, defense stocks, etc.

3097 2018-10-12 21:49:47 @FCTCofficial are idiots for thinking that. 

Excluding my 401K which @SGottliebFDA has been instrumental in restoring through BT stocks, we receive no money from them. Nor do we contribute to their top line anymore.

3105 2018-10-12 21:44:44 Most major asset classes, over time, will rise (stocks, bonds, real estate). The value of these core assets will grow faster than the value of cash. In times like these, when there's fear in the stock market and losses are everywhere, it's good to be reminded once again.
3106 2018-10-12 21:44:21 I couldn't agree more, you're absolutely right Carter. I think there's a slight correlation between tech stocks and crypto (at least under market stress) and a slight inverse correlation between cannabis stocks and crypto; both due to the investor base.
3107 2018-10-12 21:44:08 I got very  heavy in Cannabis stocks on  Wed. and Thursday.  Once I saw stocks like CRON NBEV TLRY and CGC all reverse while the market was gettin thrashed, I knew I had a must buy sector

3139 2018-10-12 21:28:48 Charts are the silk napkin at a fine dinner  and the fine wine? My stocks, as a conniseuer of good companies. The dessert? Crime Brûlée of profit. Charts are one of my keys  to success.

3144 2018-10-12 21:27:45 Problem is Peter.. Global X switched its URA tracking Index this year from Solactive Uranium Index to the Uranium & Nuclear Index.

3145 2018-10-12 21:27:37 The low rates didn’t create real growth. That’s still limping along. The low rates created a risk on attitude to stocks. They went up. You can’t use rates as a tool to control the stock market forever.

3150 2018-10-12 21:24:40 Nous voulons des #coquelicots et des concitoyens au dessus de tous soupçons de bêtises humaines. N'achetez plus les stocks de mort ! Aimez la vie !
3151 2018-10-12 21:23:40 I just checked my $50 in stocks that I invested for the hell of it. They are all up. I think I missed my calling in life. 
3152 2018-10-12 21:23:15 investments in stocks, sewin up the blocks to sell rocks
3153 2018-10-12 21:23:10 Here too i have them in my pot stocks!!
3154 2018-10-12 21:22:09 Yes general boycott is all they will understand.  Everything food elec water gas lottery( would really hurt them) if you can your job school on and on. Shut down credit cards.  Quit investing in stocks.  Turn off cable.  So many things to shut them down!!
3155 2018-10-12 21:21:54 Does @GuyAdami even own stocks? He never talks about what he owns! @CNBCFastMoney
3156 2018-10-12 21:21:37 Nope! No stress just the same old family issues. Stocks? Worry is bad for your health, and stress is a major health issue. Go take a hike, literally. If you invest for long term you don’t get affected by short term moves. I do invest multi faceted which means it’s a fine balance.
3157 2018-10-12 21:20:06 so
stocks go down
the super rich buy
stocks go up
the super richer sell
any questions ?

3159 2018-10-12 21:18:59 @CNBCFastMoney No one mentions huge pro ETF trading and effects on individual stocks. XLF was huge today. XLI, XLB and always XLE. Seem to lead everything.

3161 2018-10-12 21:18:21 When republicans talk about the economy. They are talking about stocks and investments. Not real day to day life.. How is the economy doing for you?
3162 2018-10-12 21:17:08 Where is the evidence? When it comes to conservatives, guilty until proven innocent. When it is a DEM innocent no questioning. Hypocrites.  DEMs will destroy this economy. Stocks will tumble at any signs the DEMs could take the Senate. The US downfall would start from then on.
3163 2018-10-12 21:16:23 Next week/month I predict the markets to continue dipping all the way back to low February levels. Let’s see what happens #stocks #stockmarketcrash
3164 2018-10-12 21:16:00 $CRON actually did same transition from OTC to #nasdaq. Ran up, then tanked. Better environment now for $ACBFF $ACB. I like buying #puts on $TLRY day before and Open of $ACB. More #pot stocks to trade will deflate $TLRY hype.
3165 2018-10-12 21:14:58 Wouldn't every millennial with a 401k (rarer than previous generations) or an IRA (more likely for a millennial to have, imo) own stocks? Even if by way of an index fund?
3166 2018-10-12 21:14:07 Bag holding is someone who holds on to a position decreasing in value until it’s rendered worthless.

Example: Holding a position in ENE years ago even though they were going bankrupt.

Stocks overall, penny or not have decreased but they inevitably rise.. if it’s a good company
3167 2018-10-12 21:13:52 How can we start a class action Law Suit for public corporations taking political positions that are not representative & on the best interest of all stockholders? It is obvious Facebook, Google, and a few others are engaged in conservative censorship and it is affecting stocks.

3185 2018-10-12 21:05:36 @timothysykes today was a lesson. I should’ve realized call of duty came out today and should have bought some stocks associated with that game because they all jumped up today!

3187 2018-10-12 21:04:39 It's just stocks. The cumulative percentage includes some selling as well, so though it's impressive it's a bit deceiving.

Now if they will only consider reducing those same Indian stocks another 2 million or more bales..Yet, as stated, this was a major bridge for USDA to cross.  Excellent!
3193 2018-10-12 21:03:19 Every democrat should play that clip on their ads. It’s so true... I’m really worried about boom/bust. It feels like 2006-2007 all over again. We all knew the gains in real estate and stocks would come to an end.

3210 2018-10-12 20:56:38 I’m trying to figure out when the ideal time to buy cheap stocks will be during this election cycle.

I do not budget for gas.

I don’t know how much groceries cost.

I think the economy is great.

Losing two subs looks way more dramatic
3216 2018-10-12 20:54:56 Exchanging idiosyncratic risk for systemic risk improves the odds.   

Many stocks go down more, and many stay down longer.  Few can identify which will or won't. Thus, risk transfer, but keep the upside.

3222 2018-10-12 20:52:04 It is actually pretty easy to get wealth with the right tools. Here's a few free tips: 1) Buy a suit 2) Invest in stocks. Just made you into a money making machine. No need for cliffs and boats.
3223 2018-10-12 20:51:57 Talking about stocks >>>
3224 2018-10-12 20:50:41 That’s my point.  It’s costing shareholders big $$.  Have you seen what there stocks have done in the last 30 days?  Facebook is down 25% from its peak, Twitter is down by apx 30%.
3225 2018-10-12 20:50:19 Is this some new Art of War misinterpretation. Does that mean to keep money secure you invest in penny stocks?
3226 2018-10-12 20:50:16 Chip stocks are rebounded big today, look at the semiconductor ETF $SOXL and pay particular attention to $NVDA ready to rebound.
3227 2018-10-12 20:50:07 Yes.
Plenty of stocks look like this.
3228 2018-10-12 20:49:42 more stocks will be lost from SDs due to directional air dodges than anything else in the early part of Ultimate for sure
3229 2018-10-12 20:49:00 No, Sarah. Invest in stocks. There is no worse way to invest money than in farms. Instead, look towards stocks like Tesla(TM). I didn't become a millionaire (technically) by investing in sheep/pigs. Factories: key. That's a fee lesson. Next time it'll be $100 a month.
3230 2018-10-12 20:48:29 If you own a portfolio of stocks, you must learn to sell the worst performers first and keep the best a little longer.

3239 2018-10-12 20:44:35 Correct, among others...could simply be shares converted and reported by TA.  T-trades are meaningless on real stocks like RDGL with liquidity and market interest.  Trading millions of dollars daily.  T-trades matter in .000 land and nowhere else.  $RDGL

3245 2018-10-12 20:42:53 What if someone proposed a *maximum* wage? Say, $200,000 including bonuses, stocks, etc?

That would only affect future earnings of 3.7% of US households. And they certainly wouldn't suffer.

Instead, corporations could pay living wages with the excess profit.
3246 2018-10-12 20:42:05 70+% of all stocks go down with the market!!  At that point, if you are trading an equity for an index, because you want to stay invested, net, net is a crap shoot!!

3251 2018-10-12 20:39:41 This seems to indicate no or slowing growth Rhombus. This does not compute. Stocks aren't meant to do that are they? Especially big ones like VOD.
3252 2018-10-12 20:38:39 #SUACCF18 Our stocks are definitely suffering as of right now. We are down thousand of dollars. It probably has something to do with the  international trade war causing a slow growth in economy and a buyback blackout time. We will keep an eye out.

3254 2018-10-12 20:37:36 In fact, he’s not. There’s not one thing you can present that he’s done that has made the country better. He’s made friends with a mobster in Russia and is pissing off the Chinese. When every investor is telling me to get out of US stocks, that’s a head’s up about what he’s done.
3255 2018-10-12 20:37:20 Yeah... pretty sure the average Fox viewer doesn’t have two pennies to spare to rub together let alone to buy stocks.

3259 2018-10-12 20:35:06 In yesterday's USDA report, #Corn ending stocks were increased only 39 mln bu as exports increased 75 mln bu, (a future upward adjustment of E-15 is expected of 50-100 mln bu in the November report).
3260 2018-10-12 20:35:05 Current #potstocks game plan: Might not sell before the 17th as previously planned. There was no huge run up, so I'm less worried about a big dip. U.S. markets got hit & seem to be recovering, so that's bullish for all stocks. Lots of news still coming, deals too. 1/2
3261 2018-10-12 20:34:10 Identical. I've noticed this the last three crashes we've suffered. Most of the hairstylists in her salon were touting stocks they owned. The 2008 crash it was houses instead of stocks. We had one hairstylist here in Vegas who owned 12 houses ; a dancer who owned 17.
3262 2018-10-12 20:34:03 Might be difficult to find data on that given the whole cryptocurrency market (doesn’t count as stocks although many millennials trade crypto like stock) and student loans are crippling. But anecdotally, access to markets has never been easier.

3274 2018-10-12 20:30:14 This week the volatility index (VIX) soared to over $20 and markets were down substantially. Many stocks were down yet physical Gold, Silver and #Uranium were up. Commodities bulls are loose.
3275 2018-10-12 20:29:58 Reading the @guardian article today on the CPP fund investing in US private prison stocks. If the free market isn't ideological, it is still violently radical.

3278 2018-10-12 20:29:00 @cvpayne why are you such a d ok to people like Stockton. YOU NEVER LET HIM FINISH A THOUGHT. You vomit talking points.... if u think this is a good economy you're stoned. I've gotten a 1.4% raise in 10 yrs...while 1% like u and bankers are getting rich. Free money drove stocks
3279 2018-10-12 20:28:43 If you have insane gains - just take some off the table. We entered a bear market a week ago. There is no such thing like new highs - except with #Cannabis stocks.

3281 2018-10-12 20:28:24 #stocks #Fridayfeeling   For those who can wait until Trump's crash has come and gone consider investing in Union Pacific and Caterpillar Tractor. Put them away, forget them, and reinvest all dividends in a tax free account. Then watch the miracle of compounding over decades.
3282 2018-10-12 20:24:21 #TheFed#Loco ? "Trump said: “The Fed is going loco & there’s no reason for them to do it.” On Thursday morning, as stocks were falling again, he lashed into the Fed for a third time, averring that it was “out of control." @JohnCassidy

3290 2018-10-12 20:21:08 World stocks ex Europe sharply higher: US +1.4%; Europe -.2%. Caution is advised as today might be a dead cat bounce in an oversold market.  Barring new trade issues with China, 3Q earnings will set the tone and should be a positive. Still short-term very uncertain.

3294 2018-10-12 20:19:46 Playing stocks that have a spread is definitely an art, I know the early prop trading / scalping days of my early 20s helped a lot with that.
3295 2018-10-12 20:19:43 Picking stock is all BS but the reason tech stocks get affected when t notes are high is generally tech has low cash flow. They capitalize with debt or finance. When t note yields are high fewer investors put money into tech.
3296 2018-10-12 20:19:27 Ahh, that's much better. Major averages finish in the green, getting help from level bond yields, decent bank earnings, and a rally in the big tech stocks which were hammered in the selloff. Enjoy the weekend!
3297 2018-10-12 20:19:25 It’s odd that all but 17 stocks fell...

What is the 17th letter of the alphabet...?

There’s a much bigger picture here, surface dwellers will never see it. We must DIG!

3300 2018-10-12 20:17:55 US stocks have experienced a volatile week with two deep bearish trading sessions, but we survive :) Let me wish you a great weekend.
3301 2018-10-12 20:17:25 @MadMoneyOnCNBC Some people are on here stating to sell your stocks and buy crypto and gold because everything is about to crash due to the U. S. debt. Your thoughts?
3302 2018-10-12 20:16:21 Jim would you consider DIS and F value stocks and would you recommend buying them?
3303 2018-10-12 20:16:21 Yeah and people like me are reluctant to put much into the market because we don’t want to pay off other peoples’ gambling debt. I have been considering buying some steel and aluminum stocks but not when I see the market is way over leveraged or whatever it’s called.

3305 2018-10-12 20:15:45 Is Donald Trump even invested in many stocks?
3306 2018-10-12 20:15:36 @realDonaldTrump business cronies bought back their own stocks, at bargain prices, nothing has changed, for them to climb back.
3307 2018-10-12 20:15:26 Will gusse what wise guy its not trumps job or trumps fauilt for the weeks slide on wallstreet, if any thing when the fed rasies rates to quick or to fast it is going to cause some pain in stocks.

3312 2018-10-12 20:14:12 He's partly right.  Stocks are down because interest rates are up.  The catch is that interest rates are up because of trump's "policies".  The tax cuts stimulated a great economy.  Additional inflationary pressures come from price increases from the tariffs and counter-tariffs.

3320 2018-10-12 20:12:01 That is how stocks work in my personal life. I don't know abt owning them, but good jobs don't open up for years after the market goes down because of this impact of stock prices on retirements in good jobs.
3321 2018-10-12 20:11:28 Stocks finish higher but leave intact biggest weeklong slump since March
3322 2018-10-12 20:10:52 After a midday plunge stocks rebound to close broadly higher.
Dow ends +287, +1.2% to 25,339.  S&P +1.4%.

Nasdaq +2.3% as pummeled techs lure buyers.

Still heavy losses for the week: Dow -4.2%, S&P -4.1%, Nasdaq -4.9%.

Next week: avalanche of Q3 earnings reports.
3323 2018-10-12 20:10:51 Finally the stocks gave us some food after starving us, was a fun day.
3324 2018-10-12 20:10:18 My dear Sir, see exactly happened what I guess, those brokers sold their stocks after creating artificial recovery of  607 + 287 = 894 followed by negative 394 + 880 = 1274
3325 2018-10-12 20:10:15 People ask us what stocks to buy, we say all of them! Hard to go wrong at the moment for the long haul. We have been trading since day one. Very happy for this gold rush that is still near at the beginning.

3385 2018-10-12 19:45:45 If short-term gains, you're talking day trading, it's too hardcore to monitor stocks yourself so you need a trusted broker. If long-term gains, just put in more in your index fund or supplement that with stocks from companies you believe in. Talk to a planner is my real advice.

3403 2018-10-12 19:41:05 Considering all the belly-aching about recent stock & bond market volatility, I thought I'd add some concrete reality to the discussion. Since 2004 U.S. Stocks are up +228%, Foreign Developed stocks are up +106%, Emerging Markets are up +176%, and Agg Bonds are up +69%.
3404 2018-10-12 19:40:36 iHub is a pos platform and if you based any decisions on that site, you deserve to lose your money. However, your hate is mis-directed; you should be blaming the company and pumpers, cause all the stocks you listed have the same obvious issues and it's not the 'bashers'

3409 2018-10-12 19:39:20 #stocks  investors need a clear path either up or down for the DOW and S&P 500, not a string of head fakes from central bankers and hedge funds. Trump's depression is here. Wait for clearer signals, but get out if you're close to retirement and have ridden Obama's bull market.
3410 2018-10-12 19:39:06 IF the CEO pulls of this R/M it will be an easy 10 bagger for me and I really need the money. Could set me up to pay off my mortgage. If its an explosive deal .004s is not out of the question. Have seen way higher float/ O/S stocks do R/M and reach .0046

3412 2018-10-12 19:37:59 Everyone freaking out about their tiny hit to stocks and retirement.

3413 2018-10-12 19:37:49 $AMD when Lisa’s on CNBC with Cramer in a few weeks ,stocks at 40.00 you will say I should have bought the dip !
3414 2018-10-12 19:37:40 The market seems to be having a ‘dead cat bounce’ imo. Further downside will come to most over valued stocks. Not out of the woods yet.
3415 2018-10-12 19:37:13 Yea I don’t mean to make it sound easy. But I can’t imagine your chances go up on that 21st game if you stop believing you can win.

3420 2018-10-12 19:32:49 I would be inclined to say that when stocks dumps ppl rather buy equities as opposed to crypto As we have seen with the lack of bullish momentum following btc dump

Business losses due to trade wars, a skyrocketing National Debt. Why would any sane man keep his money in stocks? .... Sell and get the hell out for a while

3439 2018-10-12 19:26:47 One of the funniest thing I have come across since the decline in stocks is when people say buy amazon, and Netflix
3440 2018-10-12 19:25:43 IMO you shouldn't invest in penny stocks. If you looking to invest in a company that can benefit you and the world search for something that is traded on more elite exchanges that require more disclosure on the companies behalf.

Once again, All IMO @TradingTeacher
3441 2018-10-12 19:25:39 YES!!! ^^^^
Americans should NOT FEAR a market disruption. The economy is MUCH more than stocks & bonds. 
Not to say there won’t be pain - there will. But it will be ok.
3442 2018-10-12 19:25:27 Well yeah and every time it leads to a major risk off event or recession. So "buy stocks, the economy is great, but we're going to pop the bubble!" 3 times in 20 years....
3443 2018-10-12 19:25:11 Let’s see.... Democrats on the verge of taking control of the house again. A likely impeachment proceeding on the horizon, INFLATION, business losses due to trade wars, is there any reason for any sane man to keep his money in stocks? ... one word of advice....”SELL”!!!
3444 2018-10-12 19:24:49 BOY WHY

this is apart of the game. Stocks on discount.

Investing is a longterm game, no emotional money
3445 2018-10-12 19:24:41 Absolutely insane breakout on 10 times average volume - this is going nuts from yesterday close of $5.78 to ATH of $8.00.

As @Scottrades says ...you never have enough of good/running stocks and I am repenting not loading more of this yesterday...I’ll still not learn though 
3446 2018-10-12 19:24:17 Sounds like manipulation of stocks
3447 2018-10-12 19:24:14 My mom never earned above minimum wage for 30 + years.  Managed to raise  two daughters, give them opportunities AND save a small pension plan.  It can be done. Learn about stocks. Read a book. Take a class. Nothing keeps us from learning.
3448 2018-10-12 19:24:09 We must be careful not to over-trade. More importantly, no vengeance trading! Trying to "make it back" is a wicked proposition. #stocks

3489 2018-10-12 19:05:17 Starting to see FEB 2.0. Obviously much different because most stocks have broke major support levels this time around. I could see a quick multi week bounce then either some consolidation or straight back into a retest of lows. Like Feb.
3490 2018-10-12 19:03:38 US actions are inflationary even if they may be transitory. So, the bonds mildly sold and Fed had to tighten further, and the stocks corrected to compete against the rising yields. The “meltdown” is only a 7-8% pullback. What’s so tragic or mysterious about this?!?
3491 2018-10-12 19:02:49 Low volatility day:

3533 2018-10-12 18:46:57 I don't see much else Trump *can do* besides a trade war, admittedly, but for the long term it worries me as a lot of the tech stocks are ones that tanked on the 10th-11th that led to drops in the economy then.

The bailouts to farmers are also literally socializing handouts.

3538 2018-10-12 18:45:50 Stocks were up 400 ,dropped 500, now back  up 30 points. Have not seen swinging like since the Brunette Jewelry Host GIF.
3539 2018-10-12 18:45:15 Why? Its the tech stocks tumbling. By your philosophy Serge and Zuck should step down

3542 2018-10-12 18:44:07 I am.  But it’s not on regular stocks.  Bought DGAZ stock & UNG puts.  Whenever small tumbled like this happen, I look to natural gas for a play.  Plus, its that time of year to be looking that way
3543 2018-10-12 18:44:01 Also, many of strong tech stocks held above 200dma early in year. Many ripped below. Be patient. If it is meant to go up, it will.

3558 2018-10-12 18:36:40 Still flat. This bounce is an obvious bull trap that was apparent by about 9:35 am. Mid/small cap stocks ($MDY $IWM) are lower than yesterday's close. They peaked ~15 seconds after the opening bell. This is NOT (nor has it ever been) a buying opportunity. You've been warned.

3561 2018-10-12 18:35:30 Yes I do understand stocks rise and fall as well as how they function. There's a lot of volatility that has so much to do with the tariffs. I swear I didn't project anything on Trump that he has done or not done on his own already. So I guess radicalized Democrat is a compliment.

3632 2018-10-12 18:05:57 Hoping for doomsday; and lining up your best options in case of a bad economic situation, are not the same thing. (Joe Kennedy Sr. made his first killing shorting stocks in 1929.  Yet, I doubt he was "hoping" for a collapse).
3633 2018-10-12 18:05:55 @NileshShah68  Surprised to see the performance of Kotak PMS far below benchmark (last 12-15 month) What is surprising is selection of stocks & value at which they been purchased.

3644 2018-10-12 18:02:09 2:00 PM ET  for margin clerks.  My sense is they'll try to knock 'em and when they don't cave, shorts will turn tail and cover.   But we're not playing that, per se; we own our stocks, we've got some non-correlated hedges and the market will dictate the rest.  Good luck.

3652 2018-10-12 17:56:43 He's absolutely right.  The valuations on these stocks is bubble territory.

The market is going to be massively over-supplied and many of these companies will be belly up two years from now.
3653 2018-10-12 17:56:25 sauteeing,  making  stocks,  apps,  entree's  and desserts  i was tired and bored with cooking, and ready to do  other  things. Then, about 23 years  ago, I took up the challenge of artisan bread baking.  It refreshed me and changed my life.
 
When telling others about it,
3654 2018-10-12 17:56:20 Boy the PPT (plunge protection team) is working overtime today to hold the market up. #stocks #StockMarket
3655 2018-10-12 17:55:35 Taking this time to sit out of the market and study my scorecard of past trades. Specifically losing trades. Analyze what went wrong. Revise my rules as needed. Learning. Taking action. Improving.

3666 2018-10-12 17:51:39 Okay, Gary, I have no idea what "counterfeit stocks" are...
If I short a stock, I borrow "real" stock from my broker, and sell it to someone that wants to buy "real" stock..
I do this all through my broker..
What is "counterfeit" stock??
Serious question, I have no idea..

3685 2018-10-12 17:41:51 I had a dream last night that I went to buy 500 stocks but accidentally bought 500 socks instead because I didn’t read it close enough. I wasn’t upset in the dream though.

3687 2018-10-12 17:41:36 As for the Scheftels company laying itself open to the charge of bucketshopping in "shorting" stocks, such a possibility was never dreamed of. #GGRadventures

3690 2018-10-12 17:38:44 Very helpful when everything was green this morning. I was watching my stocks rebound this morning which is what I’ve been waiting for. Way to go check n you profiting. Enjoy your stay in SF!
3691 2018-10-12 17:38:30 Thank you Richard, I’ve picked up ColdZyme and I’ve been told good things so I’ll give it the next 24 hours to see. But I’ll also see where stocks this honey rum!
3692 2018-10-12 17:38:13 I've made such a wide variety of mistakes over the 38 years I have traded for a living it is stupefying. The good news is that if you are open to them, you learn from those mistakes. I trade futures, stocks and options.
3693 2018-10-12 17:38:03 You're a bad lawyer if you're not making money on the ups and downs of a thing.

Stocks? Imma sweat every fucking decimal point on the way down because I'm losing imaginary realizations.
3694 2018-10-12 17:37:56 1/2 A SINGLE TIMELY #TRADE makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE!  Many stocks like $VPG headed down recently.  Past 40 wk buy-n-hold return: +34%.  Our subscribers' return on 34 wk long + 6 wk short:  +103%.  Same stock, same period.
3695 2018-10-12 17:37:40 stocks look bad
3696 2018-10-12 17:37:32 You’ll get hooked quick. Calling your shot on a stock based on research and seeing it rise/fall in value is the same feeling (good and bad) as buying a player and seeing their price/performance change. 

Only difference is the higher monetary cost with stocks haha

3698 2018-10-12 17:36:33 I don't believe the SRPT correction had anything to with last weeks micro-dys GT update. Look at the entire biotech sector and how many stocks got punished. Also, the SRPT correction started three days BEFORE Dr. Mendell's WMS symposium presentation.
3699 2018-10-12 17:35:22 Time for Stocks and Socks season!!!
3700 2018-10-12 17:34:25 No one on fintwit, aside from the usual perma bears, even remotely thinks we have entered a bear market or that this correction is nothing else but the usual blip. That bothers me a bit. Margins will take a hit with higher yields and stocks are still very expensive historically.
3701 2018-10-12 17:34:24 I still remember McCain's Sept 2008 (DEEP RECESSION) declaration that "The fundamentals of the economy are strong." Nobody gave a shit, and stocks continued to get shredded for months. I was busy going broke from the housing bubble though, so I wasn't paying close attn.

3710 2018-10-12 17:32:11 The buying low, selling high concepts are identical to me. Like buying the massive dip on the Chinese tech stocks right now is basically like buying Amari Cooper in dynasty haha

High price and performance in the past, very volatile, but massive upside if/when it hits
3711 2018-10-12 17:31:47 This is where I buy stocks

3714 2018-10-12 17:31:01 I’d say it’s a hugh step up from O’Bama! The deficit during his time was more then all the presidents together. The the stocks are back to where they were. Higher then Obama could only dream! Every promise Trump made, Trump has kept. He’s done more in 2 yrs then Obama in 8yrs!
3715 2018-10-12 17:30:32 This is the kind of signing that stocks the G-League affiliate. I'd be surprised if Machado gets a Lakers practice in.

3718 2018-10-12 17:30:04 Dollar General is doing really well!  With the Dow sinking, I "named my price" by placing limit orders which went through the next day on several Tech Stocks...what goes up must come down. Feel free to join my ladies stock group on Facebook at Linda's Stocks...

An incline of the head, a sense of impatience radiating from the redhead as she waited for him to fill her in.

3724 2018-10-12 17:28:03 The best buy would be stocks or land or any other asset that has not catastrophically changed in value.

3727 2018-10-12 17:26:57 I’ve found the parallels between stocks and fantasy football are striking. 

But also I might just be saying that because I’m an idiot 21 year old who doesn’t understand stocks as well he understands fantasy football haha
3728 2018-10-12 17:26:56 I retired: I became sick due to faulty chemical exhaust system. I worried that my retirement wouldn't be enough to live on and pay bills for work related medical condition. Put it in stocks, had it for 1 year before the collapse, One day it just disappeared! Worry all the time!
3729 2018-10-12 17:26:10 Now I know you lie.

800 points then next day 500.
You might want to keep a closer eye on your stocks.
Me?
I have blue chip stock.
I never worry.
3730 2018-10-12 17:26:00 start with the owners who have vested stocks

3733 2018-10-12 17:25:29 the Stock market acting weird truth, the Democrats want it to go down.
Every body keeps blaming on fed raising rates or Trump's tariffs 
maybe they found a way to manipulate the computers that buy and sell stocks
3734 2018-10-12 17:25:17 the Dow doesn't make any difference to me as i don't have stock. Only the rich who have millions in stocks benefit from higher stocks. All stock does to small investors is make them pay more income taxes on their stocks.
3735 2018-10-12 17:24:58 Your boy in stocks now
3736 2018-10-12 17:24:38 USD rallied on Friday, as investors gained back confidence in the economy and a four-day equity selloff ended.

3737 2018-10-12 17:24:12 But it does highlight something a lot of people forget, in that a vast majority of middle to low income people don’t own stocks or aren’t invested enough in the market for it to make a difference in their lives. Aka Wall Street is not the economy
3738 2018-10-12 17:24:08 October 1988. AFTER Reagan's Trickle Down Theory tax cut. Black Monday. I was in 8th grade and the "stocks" we chose in our Social studies class ALL of them tanked. Hell, Ferris Bueller's teacher was talking about VooDoo Economics.
3739 2018-10-12 17:23:17 bank stocks horrible today.  What does that mean?
3740 2018-10-12 17:22:22 What would I want to see happen? A strong close and a down open on Monday would give me conviction to add to top stocks in my long-term portfolio. #stocks #investing

3744 2018-10-12 17:21:04 Since when you started doing stocks ?
3745 2018-10-12 17:20:49 The cognitive dissonance that erupts whenever a real topic comes up.
Like that stocks can go down too.
Or *both* parties are stocked to the gills with warmongers
Or that the US is really far away from legit #1 world status in practically every dimension...

3748 2018-10-12 17:20:22 Our 12-month market objective for the S&P 500 is around 3150, up 10% from current levels plus dividends. Our stocks should significantly outperform the averages as we have done for our entire career.

3758 2018-10-12 17:17:01 Stocks are not moving today on fundamentals. It’s short-term traders taking advantage of volatility based on increased fear.
3759 2018-10-12 17:16:58 I haven’t found Motley Fool to be the best investment advice for me. I feel as if they push lower quality stocks to new investors. They’ve used that same clickbait “could be like amazon...”, for quite a few stocks.
3760 2018-10-12 17:15:42 It would appear as 1 dollar stocks are manipulated quicker than 300 dollar stocks.
3761 2018-10-12 17:15:21 True. Lets see what happens with gas prices up another 50cents and stocks down 10%.  

They can take major hits. Russia devalued currency by 50% imposed massive hardship.

Chinese & Russians can do it because they've never had it good. And US has only had it good relatively.
3762 2018-10-12 17:15:12 A Bull Market is when stocks are on the rise. Think of when a bull uses its horns to throw the stocks in the air. The Bear Market is when they are lower. Visualize a bear using it's paws to knock them down. 
#investments #bullmarket #bearmarket #stocks #financialplan #retirement
3763 2018-10-12 17:14:31 Yet here we are again. Once markets understand the impact of rising rates on Main Street it will see the unrecognized bubble and understand why bank stocks are overvalued. NIM, credit and growth are at risk - as is Main Street.
3764 2018-10-12 17:14:17 As if yesterday’s opp to buy tech stocks wasn’t enough we just got another one 30 minutes ago. Larry Kudlow said that blue collar is killing it, he’s a total cheerleader and like his boss not everything he says is true.  Wages up 70 cents in last year, not exactly killing it

3767 2018-10-12 17:13:55 It’s all the users whining about high data charges.  All the cord cutting and the same investors say these are great stocks to buy. How do you square that reasoning?
3768 2018-10-12 17:12:56 FWIW, it makes perfect sense to take some off the table of stocks that have had a good run, then look to buy back at the lows. 1st thing I’d buy at the low is at today’s ratio is Silver then gold

3771 2018-10-12 17:12:28 I have a theory about this. #Billionaires have tried to bring down @realDonaldTrump any way they can. They can't do anything about #BoomingEconomy but they can sell their stocks and get plenty of cash to send to #DemocRats trying to win #2018Election.

3776 2018-10-12 17:10:37 How's Trump getting on with banning bump stocks? Are you going to ask him that question when you next interview him?
3777 2018-10-12 17:10:17 Both of my stocks are up today. It’s a good day.
3778 2018-10-12 17:10:07 A consistent buy and hold methodology has worked for many people in other investments like #stocks and #realestate, I reckon the same method works for #cryptocurrency, too.
3779 2018-10-12 17:09:35 Hmmm... one of us has taken graduate level economics courses and trades commodity stocks, the other hasn't.  One of us also understands how percentages work, the other not.
3780 2018-10-12 17:09:29 Jim, are you still telling people to buy stocks in this tape?
3781 2018-10-12 17:09:28 Stocks 7% c’mon now
3782 2018-10-12 17:09:05 That's because 80% of UK fish stocks are caught by EU trawlers.
3783 2018-10-12 17:08:22 The ways in which financial volatility spills over into the real economy have been studied, no?

Generally, though, the value of "stocks" are responding to prospects in the real economy, not the other way around, unless and until capital costs go up due to dynamics of fin mkts.

3785 2018-10-12 17:07:06 Let me help you understand stocks. In an honest public company. Shares are sold that give part of the company's ownership. Own enough you own the company and tell it what to do. Company makes money you make money. The markets are people gambling on companies making money...#vegas

3789 2018-10-12 17:06:34 @tomkeene Once markets understand the impact of rising rates on Main Street it will understand why bank stocks are overvalued. NIM, credit and growth are at risk.

3792 2018-10-12 17:05:14 In yesterday's USDA report, #Acres were cut 600,000 on #soybeans; ending stocks on soybeans increased only 40 mln bu for 2018/19 but at a huge 885 mln bu (looks like a corn carryout).
3793 2018-10-12 17:04:50 Pretty sure 4% return on stocks annually is an amazing return. 10% would be ridiculous.

3795 2018-10-12 17:04:44 I didn't sell, but all new money saved was kept in cash, then when the market was around 6,500, I did a bunch of buys.  Right now, I'm pretty heavy in cash, invested in some dividend paying stocks, and waiting for the recession (inflation recession?), then I'll purchase again...

3799 2018-10-12 17:03:02 Stock broker who sells stock from 1918 right up to 1929, at which point I advise all clients to sell, then short the market in September of 29.
After a few yrs vacation I advise clients to buy stocks in companies positioned to manufacture planes trucks steel in a war time economy
3800 2018-10-12 17:02:58 Lol, fire your broker. There is an etf that trades on the NYSE you can look into. Mostly Canadian stocks but I think Altria is there too. Legal at federal level in US within five years. Let’s see if my prediction is right.

3816 2018-10-12 16:58:47 Rubbish. 

Answer: more selling than buying.

Why is there more selling now than buying? Because the relative prospects for residual equity interest ("public stocks") have diminished.

3826 2018-10-12 16:56:36 Markets are so inefficient it is ridiculous.

Crap stocks trading at 150x sales (vast majority of companies don’t even survive 50 years).

Total value of market goes down 10-15% in a  few days. Unlikely anything changed to warrant hundreds of billions of change. Funny.
3827 2018-10-12 16:56:33 $IWM $SPY $QQQ it seems like we're back to those frustrating early spring days. I hope we can leave these days behind us soon. #stocks
3828 2018-10-12 16:56:21 Looking at #stocks today it’s sad to realize all the money you invested in your retirement portfolio since Independence Day has been erased.

3834 2018-10-12 16:54:27 Far from a bubble or even a correction. Bond yields are up. People moved money. Now we have dip buyers boosting the stocks again. Higher interest rates help the banks more than people, so I see where he’s coming from. If the dollar is too strong though, our exports are limited
3835 2018-10-12 16:53:49 Generation Z in general is much more open to risk so it’s really about the age of the person you’re asking.

I have a very high tolerance for risk (hence my boudoir career) so when I was looking out what stocks to buy I had to think long and hard about which stocks I believe
3836 2018-10-12 16:53:22 Yup.  Which is why the Trilemma will hold.  USD doesn't go up on that.  Rates maybe, stocks for sure, but not the USD.
3837 2018-10-12 16:52:35 The big short of stock is beginning, If you own stocks  now Just shut your eyes and blame tRump ! . 2020 the have gone up 100% again or more . And if you have money you can can buy them cheaper today LOL

3855 2018-10-12 16:49:09 Its not about letting others make decisions its about cooperative decision making. Fish don't know about national waters so we need cooperatively agreed quotas to avoid one nation exhausting the stocks.

3862 2018-10-12 16:47:27 February was the high of the year in growth stocks and many are 25% off those highs. Not the first year of this. May highs often a quant churn, rotation to revisit Feb highs only to be rejected... buy October, sell February warrants evaluation?
3863 2018-10-12 16:47:08 Some twenty three year olds still ask there parents to go out and others are married in states far away. Some ask how to take loans out and others receive dividends from stocks they invested in years ago.

3873 2018-10-12 16:46:11 Stocks fall back on news that Trump:Xi meeting may not occur after all. #10Y futures back to recent highs.
3874 2018-10-12 16:45:49 Then they best get selling stocks whilst they can, when the Republicans lose their hold, the markets may dip, which is a normal gut reaction.

3877 2018-10-12 16:45:36 I knew that’s what you meant but was just pointing out there may be the other side, too, especially given the opportunity for a positive headline on trade (among others). EMs, China in particular, been punished much more than US stocks—room for global recovery, too.
3878 2018-10-12 16:45:14 I’ve done the math before. My conclusion at the time was that stocks > home ownership

3880 2018-10-12 16:44:52 Audit the fed. Drop stocks and invest in metals. Gold silver and platinum before it's too late. And audit of the fed will bring the end of the fed and fiat dollar, and bring a metals backed dollar. Prior investment can turn a HUGE profit at that point.

3992 2018-10-12 16:14:02 in short; nothing major. it's been a while since investors have taken profit, indexes fell between 4-6% & correction territory is -10%, upside is that stocks are now more affordable going into earnings season. Any investor panic is really just white noise
3993 2018-10-12 16:13:56 This is what a strong stock looks like. No sells in 45 minutes of trading action. Getting locked by long term holders. Strong stocks don’t dump 100’s of millions in a couple hours lol learn and understand the difference  $NHPI

4006 2018-10-12 16:10:25 Soaring bond yields have dampened demand for riskier assets as it has sparked speculation about faster-than-expected rate hikes. Higher rates will likely erode corporate profits and slow down economic growth, making investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks.

4010 2018-10-12 16:09:36 A slight bargain hunter rush at the beginning but the reality of higher bond prices tempting investors to trade in stocks for bonds will continue.  I don't think an equilibrium of actual stock value has bottomed out yet.
4011 2018-10-12 16:09:34 I think what's happening to that stock market has to do with computers buying and selling stocks, who puts data in these ,"democrats"
4012 2018-10-12 16:09:34 No it's not safe to buy stocks. The overnight bounce stalled after open and now has failed because all the major averages tested their 200 day averages, were turned back and now are moving lower again.

4015 2018-10-12 16:07:50 If today's rally stays intact (and at times today, it's looking a little "iffy"), many leading stocks will start forming tradable reversal chart patterns.
4016 2018-10-12 16:07:37 So while this is going on. The south bracing a hurricane, stocks plummeting and two people in WH acting cray cray. Why wasen’t  this stopped?
4017 2018-10-12 16:07:10 You are right on all of it, but it seems a bit one sided and negative.  I didn't vote for Trump but I seize the opportunities he has made.

Stock buybacks are happening, so I buy stocks and have doubled my salary this year.

4026 2018-10-12 16:05:26 As far as I'm concerned it's you doing the unwarranted barking, good sir. Whether one invests in crypto, stocks, precious metals, or moon rocks (for all I care), the bottom line is profit.

Clearly, you have the narrative of someone who has missed the boat on this asset class.

4037 2018-10-12 16:01:22 @greggutfeld Obama NEVER had a year in which the economy averaged 3% GDP growth. In just 18 months, Trump has already had a year in which growth averaged 3%. It is economic growth (as measured by GDP) that determines how well the economy is doing, not fuel prices or the stocks

4045 2018-10-12 15:58:33 I almost wish it would go down more. Domestic stocks are still over valued vs foreign.
4046 2018-10-12 15:58:02 No. I believe that the people actually WORKING - picking our crops, making our food, driving trucks, teaching kids, building roads - should earn more for their labor, since they work harder, create more, vs a guy who inherits billions from daddy and trades stocks for a living.

4049 2018-10-12 15:56:09 The history of Wall Street thru every recession, depression, or crash shows that no matter how steep the decline stocks always recover. Actually they return not only to their previous highs but most often even HIGHER

4075 2018-10-12 15:48:41 Should’ve bought more Aurora stocks when it was down yesterday. It’s up again, but is still might buy some.
4076 2018-10-12 15:48:27 They will be taking over shares and stocks in the near future?
4077 2018-10-12 15:48:27 Gotcha.  I realized something I'd read earlier couldn't be true when the news this this morning reports stocks down, gold up.
4078 2018-10-12 15:48:24 After the recent dip, a market correction (profit taking) isn’t a bad thing in fact it’s good after a 52 week high; gives stocks a chance consolidate before moving higher, which they did, opening on a high.
4079 2018-10-12 15:47:59 That's some stupid investment advice unless you consider investing to be a charity. Believing in a company is not the way to pick winning stocks. You might feel good, but you probably won't make much money. Due diligence is how money is made on Wall Street.
4080 2018-10-12 15:47:37 Stocks doing the dead cat bounce, giving a good entry to get short imo
4081 2018-10-12 15:47:35 I was not sobbing when my stocks were tanking. I'm not ecstatic when they're rocketing. Detachment helps navigate volatile market and allocate capital efficiently.
4082 2018-10-12 15:47:35 $HEAR is one of the most shortened stocks in the market. The only one profitable. Now with the preliminary Q3 report and the surge in guidance. $HEAR will rock.
4083 2018-10-12 15:47:28 Yeah cause the difference between that and the return on stocks will determine if u come out on top.  What’s left over from that difference u reinvest in stocks. We haven’t even talked about taxes as well ha

4086 2018-10-12 15:46:55 @asymmetricalpha a scary thought for you:

Since we're still yet to break the trendlines in play since 2pm 10/09 on most stocks today's gap wasn't the dead cat bounce but a technical reset to touch TL. Which means there's still a bounce to come...

But how low first??
4087 2018-10-12 15:46:32 $SPY I'm still bullish on select stocks however at the same time think it smart to stay hedged some on the overall market. Example $UVXY

4089 2018-10-12 15:46:18 Nice bear market rally, but this sucker's got way more room to fall! Credit cycle is turning...very bearish risk assets. Best hedges will come from the most over-hyped mo-mo stocks, like $NFLX $AMZn and $TSLA

4095 2018-10-12 15:44:06 Seeing lots of stocks I've exited with decent bounces (of course), but then when u see it in context of daily/wkly charts it's barely a blip, that damage was so sudden and severe. Similar to the correction in Jan/Feb, could easily take a couple of months before all becomes clear.
4096 2018-10-12 15:44:03 i wouldn't be surprised to find out the US stocks plummeted because they funnelled their funds into Canadian weed stocks. Especially with the upcoming legalization in a couple days.
4097 2018-10-12 15:43:52 is that assessment made under the influence (overweighting) of cannabis (stocks) ?
4098 2018-10-12 15:43:50 Then why didn't it soar Wed when the bulk of the drop in stocks occurred? 
Coz the rise in #Gold yest was due to the thawing of US-China relations with news of a  meeting between Trump and Xi at G20 on Nov 30 and US Treasury choosing not to label China a ccy manipulator.
4099 2018-10-12 15:43:49 To be fair the market had a huge dive as Obama came into The Great Recession so there was a huge gap to move up to. Also, stocks do not equal a good economy or wages as the past 6 years have shown.

4106 2018-10-12 15:41:57 Oh please stocks are up 40% since election. The only reason Obama had an increase is because we were already on a major downturn. Anyone or monkey, dog or cat sitting in the President’s chair during that time would have had the same outcome. Nice try.
4107 2018-10-12 15:41:42 It’s funny, when markets go down people get scared yet when the prices of consumer goods go down people line up for hours to buy the product. This is because we’re taught to consume instead of invest, and taught to see value in discounted products versus discounted stocks.

4117 2018-10-12 15:39:28 My advice to young investors... Research & Analyse 4-5 stocks only, instead of more & more. Mastering 4-5 stock will be having more possibility of turning you to be wealthier instead of 100 and so on stocks.

You are just a stock away from becoming billionaire.

4144 2018-10-12 15:28:17 CNBC always does it with stocks hoping the herd will buy their bags..SMH..such journalistic integrity..LMFAO
4145 2018-10-12 15:27:53 That’s good. The market was down 1500 points as of yesterday but up another 200 today because of tech. Hope your stocks are doing well. Mine aren’t.
4146 2018-10-12 15:27:50 Whatever methods you use to pick stocks, your success will depend on your ability to ignore the worries of the world long enough to allow your stocks to succeed. No matter how intelligent you are, it isn't the head but the stomach that will determine your fate.

4147 2018-10-12 15:27:50 Thanks to @Farshad_Tehrani I’m buying stocks.
4148 2018-10-12 15:27:43 I would invest into things like Starbucks and apple and buying stocks and buy my own house. I would try and make my money make me more money.  Gemini Venus(2H) is the only thing in my 2nd house.

4151 2018-10-12 15:26:53 Let's substitute stocks for investments. My coworkers are so consumed by their student loans that they aren't investing period. It also doesn't help that at our job we can't even contribute to our 401k until a yr, well 1 yr if your anniversary falls close to an enrollment period
4152 2018-10-12 15:26:41 My strategy is never buy on IPO day but then I missed TRUL and I was second guessing to change it, stocks behave like erratic kids can’t guess what will they do next

4154 2018-10-12 15:26:21 Fox News stock analyst says buy stocks...a strong stock market is good for republicans going into the midterms
4155 2018-10-12 15:26:08 Its just borrowing money to buy (or short) stocks. Accounts have individual limitations to them depending on account size and a few other things. But forced selling doesn't care about price. Just about getting to cash

4159 2018-10-12 15:25:15 Headlines from @HoustonChron:

"Markets drop again as risks grow"

Same newspaper same day

"Profit reports may slow stocks' tumble"
4160 2018-10-12 15:24:12 It's my own theory from watching stocks for years. Oftentimes though I find my stuff matches Elliott Wave pretty well. Probably due to the symbiotic nature between Elliott and Fibonacci.
4161 2018-10-12 15:24:08 don't jump too fast, if u focus on individual stocks, that's ok, hehe
4162 2018-10-12 15:23:53 What about Cairn India, Vedanta, and many more are trading below it's IPO or FPO.....
4163 2018-10-12 15:23:15 70% of small cap Technology stocks are down 20%+ from their 52-week highs.
4164 2018-10-12 15:23:10 this weeks stock market decline was in part caused by investors concern that the 20% decline in China stocks and the 10% decline in European stocks in the last six months will result in economic problems for US companies...causing problems here
4165 2018-10-12 15:22:58 "stocks have fallen back into correction territory" - for this afternoon
4166 2018-10-12 15:22:08 Would be as good as the stocks then
4167 2018-10-12 15:21:31 Stocks rarely perform in the time frames we predict, & it’s why the market only works for investors having long-term focus. Performance is never linear, up and to the right, year after year. You sometimes have to hold a position for few years before it goes up 100% in 3 months.
4168 2018-10-12 15:21:28 You how curiosity is when stocks are advertised it all looks like honey road
4169 2018-10-12 15:21:10 Of stocks do 10% over the next 20 years, I'll eat my hat.
4170 2018-10-12 15:20:12 You can tell! And that's what I love most about your stocks.
4171 2018-10-12 15:20:10 I do the same in a cash acct with TdAmeritrade. I trade mining stocks <gold> and lately, I've been trading marijuana stocks. For fun you should look at ACBFF.
4172 2018-10-12 15:19:57 but to my point if a visit to Home Depot and your local gun store cant take out the robots then humans have already lost. And not the local gun store that stocks a bunch of .50 cal stuff.

4174 2018-10-12 15:19:19 Stocks: $150k @ 10% / yr = $2.6m 

less $1k / month rent = ($360k) 

Net: $2.2m 

House: $150k @ 6.8% / yr = $1.1m

less: 2% annual repair = ($90k) 

Net: $1m

4175 2018-10-12 15:19:16 Time to contemplate the fact that the $VIX closed at 11.61 on October 3rd, just 5 trading days before the big $SPX selloffs of the last 2 days. 

And everybody on TV told you then that low VIX meant it was safe for you to be buying stocks. 

They did that in January as well.
4176 2018-10-12 15:18:59 To be fair, Twitter has as well.  All tech stocks are sagging, which is unfortunate as I work for a Semiconductor company. :(

4180 2018-10-12 15:17:26 Thanks very much for that important information. I wanted to do stocks this coming month end but with this kind of information I feel I have to study it more
4181 2018-10-12 15:17:26 $MLHC huge volume this AM setting up for next week. All stocks have pullbacks/dips on uptrend. Lots eyes on this might break 1 billion shares traded today if this continue. We shall soon find out if this is running to .01 next week or later this month. GL 
4182 2018-10-12 15:17:24 I always enjoy the sparring with Dave Stockman. However, today you all ganged up on him pretty badly & Liz was overly aggressive & personal, badgering him as to when he sold his stocks. It was difficult for me to assess his argument. 
4183 2018-10-12 15:17:21 Yeah, and many other stocks.

4188 2018-10-12 15:16:12 Was a teenager, but still very aware. 
By the start of the 1982 stock market rally, No one, and I mean no one, was interested in stocks. Everything was hard asset, real estate and commodities.
4189 2018-10-12 15:15:53 1557 global stocks out of 2767 in MSCI all world index are in a  bear market
4190 2018-10-12 15:15:05 Stocks are dropping because interest rates are going up but they are only going up to curb inflation created by 3 factors.
4191 2018-10-12 15:15:00 We work for iStockphoto, Getty Images, Dreamstime, and more 5 others image stocks sites. More options, just for you.
4192 2018-10-12 15:14:44 I've heard of someone (in France) taking a student loan and putting it in a "guaranteed" investment with a better ROI than it cost him.
With stocks it would be finding a sucker to dump the risks on 
4193 2018-10-12 15:13:14 Usually deflation proceeds inflation. Keep powder dry for pickups in precious meatals stocks real estate and crypto as people need to sell to make ends meet. I'm sure that time window will be very small.  Be ready to act when opportunities present
4194 2018-10-12 15:13:09 NYSE TICK did register its second lowest reading in a decade (H/T Sentiment Trader) rampant selling. while % of Stocks above 10-day ma got down UNDER 3%, while % above 50-day ma UNDER 11%-  Put volumes yesterday were 2.5x avg..  yet Equity Put/call relatively lower
4195 2018-10-12 15:13:08 Yes, fair comment! I had a pretty big pf refresh, start of the year. Held mostly same stocks since, as reported each week - buys and sells!

This week I have sat on my hands (effing hard!), just topped up on  #VCT this morning with recycled divis!

4201 2018-10-12 15:11:13 As well we all should, things have a way of changing fast  especially when the “Street”, analyst or companies leak out news whether pos or neg which can make or brake stocks

4203 2018-10-12 15:11:09 Over the long-haul that is just not factual. But you invest how you are comfortable. I'm far enough away from retirement that I can take on some risk. And some stocks I buy are for 'fun' to try to make more money than I would in a savings account.
4204 2018-10-12 15:10:57 Treasuries on course for 3rd largest annual loss in 40 years; 16 of 21 commodity markets in correction (>10% price decline); 1557 global stocks out of 2767 in MSCI ACWI in bear market (>20% decline); ACWI equal-weighted global equity index -17.9% since late January.

4209 2018-10-12 15:09:25 That's the result of inflation and the teriff war trump started with China. Stocks don't directly impact day to day prices.
4210 2018-10-12 15:09:25 Investors saw the president’s policies as a reason to buy stocks. Now, the consequences of his measures are unsettling Wall Street.
4211 2018-10-12 15:09:25 So the economy that you aren't benefiting from? Especially if you don't have stocks. Then for foreign policy, how's that working out with NK right now and their new missile plant?
4212 2018-10-12 15:08:46 Wouldn't be surprised if U.S. stocks are close to unch by the end of the day, this bounce seems half-hearted.
4213 2018-10-12 15:08:36 Stocks are up again . But for how long tho? 
4214 2018-10-12 15:08:23 Stocks are up today, so you can go back to ignoring it. You only pay attention when you hope it's going bad. When you find yourself rooting against American should tell you something
4215 2018-10-12 15:08:17 LOL   I recall those old Chinese copies with the 2-part stocks weren't fabulous, but they sure got wide distribution.
4216 2018-10-12 15:08:01 You must be realistic not all stocks will sky rocket to  .01 or higher in one day. This poll end at the closing bell today. Next week it should be higher we shall see. Good luck on this stock and future investments.

4234 2018-10-12 15:03:38 I buy essentially the same amount every month to cost average. Don’t have time in residency to research stocks in depth enough like I use to.

4240 2018-10-12 15:01:58 A few things to consider before panic-selling all of your stocks (thread):      

The most active traders in Sweden made 4% less per year than their do-nothing counterparts

The U.S. economy has been in a recession nearly 20% of time since 1928 and compounded wealth at ~10% p.a.

4242 2018-10-12 15:01:44 What does it mean when a volatility fund has negative convexity?  And why would they need to dump stocks?
4243 2018-10-12 15:01:41 @rorycarron ... have you added any stocks in this dip ??
4244 2018-10-12 15:01:39 This is super interesting and a story i hear a lot. I was shocked when i realised that kids normally have to buy reading books now too as library stocks are so low. #systemsfailure big time
4245 2018-10-12 15:01:27 I actually took this bounce to move my fund to a safer one, away from stocks.
4246 2018-10-12 15:00:20 Lesson number 1. Don’t trade stocks for 3 cents. Set a stop out level lower that is reasonable and you’re comfortable with.  If something is working add to it then  find a level to sell it and not before then. Otherwise you won’t make money
4247 2018-10-12 15:00:01 wow, it’s like you put the pitch from Wolf of Wallstreet into an article about weed stocks. Brilliant!

4251 2018-10-12 14:57:24 Today. I buy stocks. 
4252 2018-10-12 14:57:07 Thanks for having me on.  Enjoyed it.  Didn't get to it but three stocks the index recently bought were $SHOP (for small biz who want $AMZN alternative), $ILMN (driving exponential decline in gene sequencing machine cost), and $GWR (narrow gauge railroad, strong fundamentals).
4253 2018-10-12 14:56:56 Thanks for the look back. Was one of my fave shows every week.I remember '87 very well('73-'74 too for that matter). Biggest difference today is the level of T-Bond interest rates. In '87 close to 10%. Was easy for pension money to wholesale switch from stocks to bonds.
4254 2018-10-12 14:56:22 You are correct, you do not understand stocks. That the price has increased on goods, of one sort or another, does not represent "how the economy is" any more than the stocks do.  Usually, those increases are a consequence of things like taxes (which is what a tariff is).
4255 2018-10-12 14:56:19 You're the guy who told everyone to sell their stocks after Trumps election because he was going to crash the market, right? Ya...i dont think you should be giving any financial advise. You have no idea what you're talking about...
4256 2018-10-12 14:56:12 I was wondering why Monster's stocks were dropping.
4257 2018-10-12 14:56:08 How many people have modified it. Bump stocks and background checks yes it has been basically non existing. When a person can walk in a gun show and buy a gun and walk out really

4267 2018-10-12 14:53:59 #Stocks,#Indexes Consistent with our view SPX has emitted a major top signal, we await the next SPX top signal, locally signaling the end of the influence of the most recent SPX signal, which was a bottom signal.
4268 2018-10-12 14:53:58 Using OD /is/ a cost, but it's a significantly more accessible one, and one she has access to.

4269 2018-10-12 14:53:46 What aftermarket parts are you referring to? Bump stocks? Sure, those are impractical, but bump fire is possible without them. Gat triggers? Also impractical, but it theoretically isn’t that hard to make an illegal fully automatic AR-15, so there’s that.

4298 2018-10-12 14:47:19 Stocks: The 300 point jump in the Dow this morning may be a sign the model can be correct that an intra-month low is due. Given that volatility is high, most would assume it too difficult to forecast. My stance is more selling can occur later this month, but it can bounce a bit.

4305 2018-10-12 14:46:35 Said it before, but there are zillions of self-proclaimed free market thinkers out there who perpetuate the myth that the Fed saved the world and drove stocks up.  They don’t understand how they violate their own, perceived, beliefs.

4309 2018-10-12 14:45:35 That's not how the market works. It's a #'s game, and policy - not politicking - has WAY more to do with determining market success. Again though, stocks are rallying today. Fears of tariffs & other *policies* is real, bc it affects business. Kav, Russia, Mueller etc don't.
4310 2018-10-12 14:45:26 The yield on 10-year United States Treasury bonds reached 7 yr high this week of 3.25 percent, receding Wednesday as stocks dropped, up from 2.82 percent in August. The 10-year rate was below 1.4 percent as recently as July 2016.
4311 2018-10-12 14:45:25 OK, so it looks like #BTC #Bitcoin is moving sideways or slightly up probably because we have a little bit of a rebound going in the #Nasdaq and stocks. However, this is temporary. Look for another BIG drop somewhere to the 5000-4000 level. I am bearish unless we cross 6660-7000.

4343 2018-10-12 14:37:31 That’s an area I have very little knowledge of to be honest. Simply musings and thoughts. Rates and tech stocks I think are huge influences imo.
4344 2018-10-12 14:37:16 Stocks went up and down. Amazing.
4345 2018-10-12 14:36:59 It's a distinct possibility given the recent news honestly. I've heard their stocks have dropped enough to notice since said news came out. If they do go through with it, it'll be the last one for quite a while.
4346 2018-10-12 14:36:46 Stocks off opening highs. Dow +200 points after up 400 earlier in the session.
4347 2018-10-12 14:36:39 Stocks are where middle class people are encouraged to put as much money as they can for the eventual retirement of their fund manager via trading fees, "poor performance" & other devices.
4348 2018-10-12 14:36:16 I do own stocks and I completely agree with you. Everything has become more expensive under this Administration. Especially groceries, healthcare, transportation. The money I have left over to live on is a lot less
4349 2018-10-12 14:36:08 The bottom 20% bracket owns more stocks than the higher-income brackets? And owned more than 20% of all stocks in 2010? Seems a little curious.

4361 2018-10-12 14:34:07 Jeff: Intermediate-term is "position trading," holding winners for several wks-several mos, best done w/ growth-stock breakouts. Short-term is either day trading or swing trading (1-5 day holds, or perhaps to 10 days), best done w/ pullbacks. One must figure out objective #stocks
4362 2018-10-12 14:33:39 $jpm this is y u don't buy bank stocks until the CC. How many times have banks done this right after a call. On the flip side, after the call & pullback has been a good time to buy.
4363 2018-10-12 14:33:26 U.S. stocks opened higher on Friday, as bumper results from the country's largest banks, including JPMorgan (JPM.N), set an upbeat tone for the earnings season.

4391 2018-10-12 14:28:00 Mortgage rates this week hit their highest level in more than seven years, at nearly 5%. The Federal Reserve has become the center of attention for rising interest rates that helped knock stocks off balance.
4392 2018-10-12 14:27:37 Stocks bouncing back like round ball
4393 2018-10-12 14:27:33 Energy stocks were the biggest losers Thursday, as oil prices fell, while the sectors that led Wednesday’s rout, like technology and communications, posted more-modest losses.
4394 2018-10-12 14:27:23 #ThisDayinMarketHistory 1990 - Just as investors are feeling pessimistic, the great bull market of the 1990s begins. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edges up 9.90 points to close at 2407.92. Stocks will more than quadruple over the next ten years. #BullMarket #DowJones #Stocks

4397 2018-10-12 14:27:02 10/10/18 most stocks hit their 52week low. Would have been the perfect time to get in. I just bought into $IGC at 4.93 a share before Canada has its first day of national recreational sales on 10/17/18. Let's see what happens with these weed stocks on that day.
4398 2018-10-12 14:26:45 Now that the first hour is ending #stocks are fading. We shall see later in the day what's up

4402 2018-10-12 14:26:22 Yup I believe so.

And there is no way to stop it. The question is not if but when.

QT and raising rates will make debt more expensive and stock buybacks fueled by cheap debt more expensive.

The PE ratio of stocks is to high and historically it always normalizes aka crashes.

4412 2018-10-12 14:23:57 I'm skeptical of up opens after down closes during periods like this, especially on Fridays. If they fade this rally into the bell, then not over. Margin folks had forced sales yesterday, and you could see some flatten out their risk into this rally. #money #investing #stocks

4455 2018-10-12 14:15:14 Interest rates...what interest rates?  Bank stocks surge and the Dow is up by 294 points...
4456 2018-10-12 14:14:48 Wow, would you look at that!!   Dow up 315 without one word from the Fed.  I hope we are entering a new era of a humble, but also non-politically-motivated Fed.  QE never lifted stocks, but by reacting to the market tantrums the Fed wanted people to believe that it did.

4459 2018-10-12 14:14:31 It is very early in the session and stocks are broadly higher. But many are currently trading below their open,  and in a very narrow range.  Even the #FANG stocks.  This dynamic will probably change and but keep your emotions in check. Trade with discipline.

4481 2018-10-12 14:09:32 I'd like to be 50/50 stocks/bonds + T-bills. Right now I'm about 70/30. It hard to cash in an investment that has been earning 8% or more per year.

4488 2018-10-12 14:06:51 I was thinking about what type of bear market would be the worst for investors.  A 2000s style flattish market seems benign, as bonds provided some protection.  An inflationary cycle ala 1970s seems like it would be the worst, because bonds and stocks would get killed.

4525 2018-10-12 13:56:19 #stocks $spx pretty narrow range on high volume. We are moving from fear to FOMO and at some point should shoot much higher and see vix plunge. May be Monday but I’m guessing biggest rally is today. Note the big gain so far is misleading  -because of huge late selloff yesterday
4526 2018-10-12 13:55:59 Maybe when impaired I'll see 'win' in these stocks.

4550 2018-10-12 13:49:59 Fair point. Right now the only "utility" of most coins is trading them like penny stocks into an exchange. This will change over time.

That being said, exchanges themselves set the conf limits so you would think they would want to make it as frictionless as possible = more fees

4552 2018-10-12 13:49:46 Sounds like all of us. And most people don’t own or understand stocks. The ones who do, want it to stay that way. They try to make you think your 401k is a big deal when they don’t even invest it in any real money making stock

4555 2018-10-12 13:48:34 interestingly, Mr. Shah hasn’t rebutted on the illiquidity part about stocks held in MFs. Actually he can’t coz what is mentioned in the article is true. There r stocks whr avg 3 month vols r in thousands & a MF holds 1 crore shares of the same.
4556 2018-10-12 13:48:22 And NO we did not come here for a one night stand or a swing trade. We trusted your vision on rebuilding this company. We r now left with insane outstanding shares, high float and stocks price lower than before u took over the company. So much disappointment.

4667 2018-10-12 13:26:20 It is not good for small individual investors to invest in individual stocks. Even in great companies like Apple or Alphabet. Instead invest in ETFs tracking broad U.S or Global indices like SPY or VT! They provide sufficient diversification you can't get on your own!

A owns stocks.
B borrows A's stocks.
B sells them to C.
      Stock value goes DOWN.
B buys them back from C, B making money.
B gives stocks back to A

Now if you are B, it pays to bad mouth or undermine the company (Tesla) issuing the stocks.

4694 2018-10-12 13:17:30 @SRuhle so let me share owning stocks is a problem when you don’t have the money to lose. The real problem is if you can’t build a big enough balance the fees paid eat your balance. Company options now place fees on employees to cover 401k accts further reducing savings
4695 2018-10-12 13:17:25 I don't believe the market is correcting.  This is the 3rd down turn this year.  I'm cynical enough to think institutions are selling, raking in huge profits, causing the down turn, then buying back the stocks 2-3 days later at lower prices, causing the market to rebound. Repeat.

4702 2018-10-12 13:16:09 The Fed Board rate has nothing to do with this stock market sell off. Trump’s tax cuts ballooned the deficit causing higher Treasury interest rates which triggered a move from stocks to Treasuries. #doyourhomework #stockmarket #Treasuries #taxcuts #deficit
4703 2018-10-12 13:15:55 People who say the drop in some stocks are indication of a bad economy are not right in any fashion. The federal reserve spikes interest rates in compensation of a growing economy, the drop we saw is the compensation that resulted. It will get passed the place it was shortly.

4732 2018-10-12 13:07:06 So why do rising interest rates cause stocks to go down? New post tonight.
4733 2018-10-12 13:06:47 Since the Fed raised interest rate. In the stocks dropped. And people are going to pull their money out of the stocks, and put it in the banks. For the higher intest. . I'd put it in something else instead of the banks,  like gold. Because who owns the banks?

Some may be a value TRAP.

Be careful while selecting stocks only based on P/E.
4777 2018-10-12 12:55:59 The drop in DJI states that we’re headed towards another recession probably worse than the last one we had. And although you don’t own stocks, financial literacy really is important for everyone or even basic understanding of economic principles from a macro scale.

The number of points the Dow has lost over the past two days. And the worst may not be over. Tech stocks have been hit especially hard during this recent sell-off.

Markets are for the big boys and the foolish. Markets do not represent the real economy.
4904 2018-10-12 12:02:12 No kidding. The fed keeps raising rates. Big banks get dividend from the @federalreserve meanwhile the economy slows and stocks tumble. Let market forces control things not the printing press known as the federal reserve.
4905 2018-10-12 12:01:58 Don’t check your stocks. Just ignore that for a bit.

4908 2018-10-12 12:00:28 Slippery slope. They didn't limit it to bump stocks, they also included anything that allows the gun to fire faster. Which could be any number of components (trigger, bcg, super fast finger). They knew that it wouldn't pass bc of that, and used it to point fingers politically.

4916 2018-10-12 11:56:29 While markets may temporarily stabilise, I see no compelling reason to currently re-invest in so-called "growth stocks." Institutional investors are taking profits. That leaves retail "day-traders" to pitch their wits against computer algos until there are no day traders left!

4921 2018-10-12 11:55:21 If your portfolio was a diverse mix of both bonds and stocks, then the drop shouldn't hurt your long term gains. Fundamentals in the economy are still good. No, I expect a rebound by midterms.
4922 2018-10-12 11:54:29 There are plenty of other stocks out there.  Remove the chart name and your bias. If it was any other random stock. Would you still buy it?
4923 2018-10-12 11:53:30 Well it is true. Markets don't just go down right away simply because something was announced. These things manifest over certain periods of time. Stocks react to other events including buyouts and takeovers or when subsidiaries are spun off. Sometimes it can be the weather.

I had several that declined 10-14% that first week and continued to go lower after exiting. Index has done good job of masking severe weakness underneath.

(4) U.S. Dollar Recovers Slightly. 
(5) Oil Prices Rise on Oversupply Fears.
4991 2018-10-12 11:28:13 Ano ginagamit mo maam to filter US stocks? Trading view ba?
4992 2018-10-12 11:28:13 The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 was up 0.8 per cent. Some of the sectors hit hardest by the selling rebounded most strongly, with the index tracking technology stocks up 1.4 per cent. (FT)
4993 2018-10-12 11:28:05 Major indices bounced off their lows in Europe and across Asia and futures trading pointed to gains on Wall Street. US stocks had suffered another heavy fall on Thursday, extending their losing streak to five sessions
4994 2018-10-12 11:27:05 That is also what happened to Naspers in the last year. They lost 40% of their value because people panicked and sold the stock. Are you now going to say Naspers stole from the investors?

Guess what, ALL stocks are down massively this year. Are they stealing from investors?
4995 2018-10-12 11:26:25 Global stocks are staging a recovery, with #WallStreet set to open higher after a negative week, as US inflation slowed in September.
4996 2018-10-12 11:26:05 I'm reading SA108 notes 2018, on P1 it decribes what is an asset, and  defines stocks and shares as assets. Are Contract for Difference (CFD)  defined as an asset as you don't actually own the underlaying share that  it relates to?

5000 2018-10-12 11:24:26 There is some merit to the argument that Trump's trade policies will cause disruption to stocks... but reconfigured supply lines - that favor the long forgotten American worker, economy, and tax base - are well worth the price.

- JMH
5001 2018-10-12 11:23:10 To find the right portfolio allocation for you its best to talk to an advisor, but you probably know if you have too much in stocks—you can’t sleep when they go down even a few percentage points.
5002 2018-10-12 11:23:00 This is so true. I’ve been saying this as well. For many, this economy isn’t great at all. All our necessary costs (gas, food, healthcare, etc.) are up while income is about the same. And those without investments (property, stocks, etc.), haven’t benefitted there either.
5003 2018-10-12 11:22:21 There is some merit to the argument that Trump's trade policies will cause disruption to stocks... but reconfigured supply lines - that favor the, the long forgotten, American worker, economy, and tax base - are well worth the price.

5004 2018-10-12 11:22:17 The stock market is 20 pts away from where it was on Jan 1.   So officially the stocks gained nothing.   @realDonaldTrump the great BUISNESS MAN.   Obama gained every year in office.    @EdKrassen
5005 2018-10-12 11:22:04 This is why Indian stocks react positively
5006 2018-10-12 11:20:49 You know what! When you are a stock investor and the stocks are increasing in price everyday you take profit, then the prices drop, they buy low. This is why they are rich. If my stocks are part of their stocks then I make money. My 401K becomes more valuable. Yeah
5007 2018-10-12 11:20:16 No, it’s a Stocks/Shares ISA platform, where investors funds are invested in 3 mutual funds. You can have low, medium and high risk (depending on how much growth you want) but he key difference between other platforms is that you can save as you spend.
5008 2018-10-12 11:19:56 Stocks came crashing down because treasury rates increased.  It all happened in an instant.  The rest, I can agree with.

5065 2018-10-12 10:44:18 This guy needs to be put in stocks in the plaza. Then tar and feathered. Finally, removed from office.  If Republicans need to cheat to win, perhaps they shouldn't be allowed. Amorality. Gerrymandering and suppressing votes--now that's cheating.

Blackout: definitely improved since beta, armor situation is still EHHH. Multiplayer: I got absolutely shreked, spray and pray, stocks are OP, not a fan honestly
5143 2018-10-12 09:56:15 Stock Market crash mostly affects the billionaire class. They hold the vast majority of stocks. But the only instance of "trickle down" happens in such cases.
5144 2018-10-12 09:56:08 Thank you for the suggestions! I am reading them now. What I want, basically, is an article titled something like 'Stocks and flows: migration studies and demography in postcolonial perspective'. Surely someone has taken on the migration studies language of migrant 'stocks'?

5146 2018-10-12 09:55:39 Furthermore, I'm starting to learn more about longer-term trends on the daily chart, and consider holding stocks for swings of a few days to maximize gains. But I'm not there, yet. ;-)
5147 2018-10-12 09:55:27 I understand not being able to place the order could be disappointing. However, as informed previously, due to huge demand and limited stocks, the product is currently unavailable. We're trying to get this back in stock, please stay tuned. ^RS
5148 2018-10-12 09:55:08 I don't do mutual funds. If I did I wouldn't pay so much attention to individual stocks. I do index funds.
5149 2018-10-12 09:54:50 The market breadth (gainers/losers) of 0.88x for the day indicates that the number of sellers outpaced the number of buyers in the market today. At the end of the day's trading, 15 stocks advanced as 17 stocks declined; NIGERINS (+10.00%), PRESTIGE (+8.33%)...
5150 2018-10-12 09:54:16 No. Actually, I now try to hold each (winning) trade for at least 1-5 dollars per share. I mostly trade larger cap stocks, and try to find setups with a potential move of 2-10 dollars per share in my favour. It may happen that I exit trades earlier because of weak price action.
5151 2018-10-12 09:53:39 In just one week, someone used up all their money buying stocks of groceries at ridiculous prices. Someone spent away their money buying USD at 500%.. only to find out it’s at 150% now.. The prayers on Sunday will be thunderous

5173 2018-10-12 09:34:50 I think lots of stocks are cheap. I've been buying and have a shopping list as long as my arm - once I think the market has turned. Brexit uncertainty has certainly thrown up a lot of bombed out stocks, esp high yield financials. Aviva? LLOY?

5177 2018-10-12 09:31:00 Argh but there’s nowhere in this city which stocks the brands I wear. Oh well. An excuse for a trip to the BIG city.
5178 2018-10-12 09:30:25 Yeah, and the arb boosted imports as well. Still, the scrap ban comes at a bad time with exchange stocks where they are, and I get the feeling traders are bracing for some pretty hefty backwardations, even though the macro picture may keep prices pegged back

5193 2018-10-12 09:19:42 Actually, the ATF does not want to ban bump stocks. They allowed them in the first place after review. TRUMP talks of banning them. Idiots with no comprehension of how firearms operate want to ban them.
5194 2018-10-12 09:19:36 none of the time frames I look at, gives me a reason to believe that dis fall is complete...…...our markets are actually trading at 9000 if few of the stocks which went up madly taking the whole index trade at original levels....9900 is key support and not 10200
5195 2018-10-12 09:19:34 Not moving at all, while other stocks are on a roll..

5205 2018-10-12 09:09:22 Technically market has made bottom. Also all momentum stocks are getting hot at these bottom. From my point of view, Nifty correction is over. Otherwise if not then it will be big problem for Market. It has already corrected more than 10% in a month.

5208 2018-10-12 09:05:55 It is implodingin itself as we speak. Our tax money went to the top 1% 2x in 6mo. they are going for a 3rd time! The top 1% did not reinvest in their employees or economy, instead they did stock buy backs artificially inflating their stocks & the market. Bubble is ready to pop!

5213 2018-10-12 09:01:33 No. Chump is blaming the fed. Except he kicked out Yellen and installled Powell. I think Yellen would have kept the interest rate down, still, with all the uncertainty now of trade wars and the ICCC report. Stocks need an adjustment but companies need to rapidly shift gears.

5218 2018-10-12 08:57:41 Interesting. Matt Simmons always believed a true global recovery would come on the back of a high oil price. Most people also think ZIRP is good for growth when in fact it is destructive & steals the elderly's income. It in essence forces conservative investors into stocks/bonds.

Cash down to 49% in part due to a blue screen increasing stocks. Unlikely to do much more today for fear this could be a dead cat bounce and Friday often a day for trader sells?

5242 2018-10-12 08:35:38 @Roubini is wrong.

In 2009, just days after stocks bottomed, Roubini warned a further fall of 40 to 50% in global markets “could not be ruled out”, adding investors should “brace ourselves for new lows on US and global equities in the next 12 to 18 months”.

5266 2018-10-12 08:22:21 That's what they USED to be about. You do realize that the NRA lobbied for and helped write the first 2 gun control laws in the country, right?

And perpetrators who buy bump stocks and commit mass shootings aren't real concerned about gun safety.
5267 2018-10-12 08:22:17 Massive correction ahead will come......we hope !

Since 1984, the S&P 500 to gold stocks ratio only reached y'days level once and mining stocks rallied almost 200% for the next 7 months. We should be close to an 'inflection point' for historically undervalued gold stocks.
5268 2018-10-12 08:22:14 @MorganLBrennan @VonnieQuinn in a largely random (opaque) system, statistically the best week for buying stocks is 3rd week in October in US/UK markets. This year is likely no exception. An explanation for why markets tend to fall in October is elusive.  #ComplexityScience

5274 2018-10-12 08:17:04 Still UBS/banks sell stocks big from their ETFs at my expense and their MMs rebuy them cheap.
5275 2018-10-12 08:16:48 yeah because if you sell now, you will book losses and if you don't sell you will book further losses - in any case you have to book losses so selling stocks is the worst thing you can do right now

5278 2018-10-12 08:14:45 It is ordinary for stocks behind new tech to have higher volatility during price ascension. Facebook's private valuations were no different. But lately Bitcoin's volatility has sunk quickly. In fact, versus food, it's not all that different from the dollar's.
5279 2018-10-12 08:10:05 By pulled the trigger I mean I completely exited stocks and am holding cash in my 401k. So every market drop is money I'm not losing and money that will be buying the bottom.

5308 2018-10-12 07:52:38 Yes!, this is similar to some of them who did chest thumping of buying quality stocks during the Mid and Small Cap carnage in the early part of this year. Now, some of their PF is down 20% or more.

5321 2018-10-12 07:44:44 This is short lived bcoz some companies decided to suspend buz, few companies are reordering, we still don't hv critical stuff like fuel, forex payments backlog still a headache. Fact is USD stocks remain critically low, only its demand has just temporarily gone down!

5329 2018-10-12 07:35:06 I'm paying more attention to the economy more than anything right now: we're due for a Recession around 2020, so this may just be a temporary drop ala 2000 rather than 2008, but we need to see how stocks end today before we get an idea.

5342 2018-10-12 07:22:56 It is a matter of time. Holders may not return their money within a year, but they will get much more in 10 years, I would guess – HT market will recover after the depression (if it will actually happen). Also, #crypto rise does not depend on those who lost their money in stocks.

5505 2018-10-12 05:21:34 In a 30 years investment period, its better to stick to sound and repeatable investment process. Occasionally it goes out of favour and yields lower return but saves lot of agony in tough times. Asset Allocation is one such, second being buy and hold quality stocks.

5507 2018-10-12 05:20:31 And crypto is in a bear market. Go back and check volatility of US indexes in 2008. A lot of daya were +3% or -3%. There were -8% days in indexes. Do you know how much some stocks need too fall to have a -8% in indexes?
5508 2018-10-12 05:20:31 Some of the stocks I am holding from 2014-15 n I always have around 10-12% of my portfolio in cash in gud times which get deployed during correction plus I don’t hesitate 2 borrow n invest during panic....!!!!

5515 2018-10-12 05:15:25 Purchasers rarely stockpile, DH; sellers do, so that they can be assured of stocks out of which they can continue to make sales.  For a customer who can't buy cheese, well, there are other foodstuffs.  For a cheese-seller who can't sell cheese, ruin beckons.

5519 2018-10-12 05:12:18 Corrections are a normal part of the business & market cycle. The way earnings have trended, any sort of trade deal with China is likely to restart the bull market.

5524 2018-10-12 05:07:00 Oh, you've gone and drunk the kool-aid. Trump is a con man, who has fooled an awful lot of otherwise intelligent people. Interest rates are rising, stocks are dropping (last week he praised himself for unprecedented stock growth, now he says he knew the drop was coming).

5526 2018-10-12 05:06:03 The government has pretty much unlimited funds. By your hindsight dependent logic, the correct policy would have been to borrow to the very limit we could service (which could be debt financed itself anyway) and put it in stocks.
200% return! It would have been right to do it!
5527 2018-10-12 05:06:01 Stocks fell from the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates this week for the third time this year, and alluding that they might do it an unprecedented 4th time, undermining economic growth.

5552 2018-10-12 04:53:52 100 million at .0005 isnt necessarily low volume, but there isnt a lot of money being traded. that's only about $50,000 dollars in traded money to that point. your looking for 300K traded in stocks in the OTC. a million dollars in a day is great for a penny

5562 2018-10-12 04:47:20 Love the rant.

It goes beyond stocks. Consider the housing bubble, the dot-com bubble, the energy frauds by ENRON and others. Capital is inaccessible to regular people but it does a ton of harm. The entire world is still convulsing from the 2008 crash.

5564 2018-10-12 04:46:08 When panic strikes, a/c balances are pushed to the Zimbabwe stock exchange as a hedging tool against hyper inflation, this then pushes up the prices of  stocks, which means more RTGS is generated, upon cooling off, the same RTGS balances are then sold at high prices back to banks
5565 2018-10-12 04:45:43 #Trump is not alone in blaming the Federal Reserve for this week's tumble in stocks, as many investors attribute the ebbing of easy money for spurring an outbreak of #StockMarket turmoil.

5575 2018-10-12 04:39:49 My take: when the bond interest rate rise impacts stocks the hint that the Fed will have to abort tightening and thus ignore inflation gives the gold market the smell of stagflation.
5576 2018-10-12 04:38:27 Trump is using Kanye, the same way he used every single celebrity who volunteered for his shitty show that ran on NBC for years. It's a fucking ploy. Fuck Kanye West, Fuck Donald's Trump.

5581 2018-10-12 04:35:44 If we move above 10500 today we can turnaround sharply in the short-term and as said earlier give a Q2 result rally in stocks and even indices.
5582 2018-10-12 04:34:27 Feeling it aswell, already -10% loss of the total I put in stocks
5583 2018-10-12 04:33:51 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump So...still want to gloat over the markets?  You own the losses for all your bs on the increases. Lucky I am smarter than you and my money is in smart stocks. You people are guiding a bubble. Stop wasting time with Kanye meetings & work!
5584 2018-10-12 04:33:39 Only because I worked in a call center can I explain this in very lay terms.
Stocks 101: a share is a very small portion of a company. When you get a share, you become an investor. When the company does well, the value rises because more people want a piece of the pie.
5585 2018-10-12 04:33:22 Part of why the stock market has been doing so well is due to the tax bill giving corporations huge breaks which allowed them to buy back massive amounts of their own stocks. The rich get richer. Our kids will be left with the bill for that $1.5 trillion disaster.
5586 2018-10-12 04:33:09 It’s all tech stocks... but his China made TV remote still works, so clearly it’s the filthy hippy liberals fault.  Wouldn’t have happened if had  we not spent so much on FBI investigations on EVERYONE in his cabinet.  #firethefool
5587 2018-10-12 04:33:06 The uranium stocks addition was a nice touch
5588 2018-10-12 04:32:31 That's one setup I do follow most of the time in stocks..
5589 2018-10-12 04:31:20 they're down
Fed raised interest rates
this raises yield on new bonds
rich people moved some money from stocks to bonds
less rich people saw the market dip, panicked, and sold, which caused a larger dip
even poorer people saw this dip, panicked, etc
5590 2018-10-12 04:31:19 @Abhishekkar_ hi bro, in your yesterday video (Vwap cash) you traded in 5 stocks, but why you traded particularly that 5 and how you find that 5 stocks for intraday? Please explain  (Thank you for educating small traders )
5591 2018-10-12 04:31:00 Stocks go up when profits go up. Bonds go up when interest rates go down. Hopefully you have the same information as insiders when they are allowed to make buy/sell decisions. In reality, broad diversification and hoping for the best is all you can do.
5592 2018-10-12 04:30:53 Reduced exposure to #ASX by at least 50% over the last week. A lot of damage done technically to various stocks, may be a prolonged period of predominantly cash coming up if things continue #trading #EOD
5593 2018-10-12 04:30:52 October: "This  is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks in. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February." - Mark Twain.
5594 2018-10-12 04:30:41 Let's all remember the reason why YG is not in the big3 for now, it's a company who bought Big Shit's stocks.
It's not about the music, my babies 
5595 2018-10-12 04:30:00 Diversify. I own 2 homes which will both be paid off in a couople of years. and have stocks, savings etc but the greatest investment was my houses.  Of course factors like when you buy, how much is your rent and interest rates all factor in so you have to do math I guess.

5600 2018-10-12 04:26:40 This is a pretty slim data set though. Btc in an outlier upwards year and stocks in the middle of a long bull. Let’s see a longer timeline. I believe it’s close to 0 correlation
5601 2018-10-12 04:25:41 We have a market day today full of bounties and optimism.

5602 2018-10-12 04:25:23 Sounds like a stock trader through and through to me. Problem is, tech stocks will drop 50% but by that stage, Crypto would have increased another 1000%+

5605 2018-10-12 04:23:57 You mean like the suggested combination of high interest rates in part caused by tax cuts and business deregulation as well as the trade war with China applying pressure to tech stocks? I mean there are multiple points involved.
5606 2018-10-12 04:23:37 No. That’s not correct. The market is up since 1929, but I said it ‘was on a great 10 yr run.’  The market has not been up consistently since 1929. There are long periods during that time where you would have been better off not being heavily invested in stocks.

5618 2018-10-12 04:14:51 "This creates a cascade of poor decisions." - I'd say it creates a cascade of rational reactions to fear until the point when it is overdone. This could be 20%+ lower however on an index or worse on individual stocks. Volatility clusters, see Mandelbrot.

5627 2018-10-12 04:11:11 That was very terrifying. Had any of my stocks tanked considerably I'd be in real trouble.
5628 2018-10-12 04:11:02 A well balanced portfolio should include:

5630 2018-10-12 04:10:39 I check btc charts first and then I know whether the stocks are up or down. And most of the time bitcoin trades in reverse to gold.

About the ECON:
Canada, Mexico, Japan, South Korea and the European Union agreed on Donald Trump’s terms. China’s stocks stumbles because the growth rate down. Meanwhile, US stocks down because of the growth rate UP!

5641 2018-10-12 04:05:04 My reasoning suggested crpto coins to be a great indicator for markets.  People get into it as there is more free money and any fall in crypto would suggest tightening of that which would lead to liquidation 1st in crypto and then in stocks.

5660 2018-10-12 03:57:53 One thing I learned during my short time on Wall Street - the smartest investors listen to economists when planning their portfolios.

In reality, stocks have to do with fundamentals, irrational exuberance, random investment fuckery, and the economy.    But it's complex.
5661 2018-10-12 03:56:40 If they become the market leader in drinks, that could pay well, but there’s a **lot** of competition. $KO was rumored to be talking to $ACBFF and both stocks went crazy until the latter denied anything had happened. I’d look at companies given licenses in different CA provinces

And yes, you do understand stocks, you can't afford them and if you could, they would crash the moment you invest in them. Warren Buffet will get your money.
5696 2018-10-12 03:36:17 really you're so smart you should analyze and sort the tape by trade size - stocks move in cycles, cycles driven by smart money accumulating or distributing and you should be able to see that, additionally there are "groups" that behave similarly and graph could come in there

5754 2018-10-12 03:07:03 #RMITEP3 Investing in the stock market can be detrimental. I think investing in something physical would generate a greater and safer return in the long run. Also, there will be new guidelines and reporting standards that will follow that will raise costs even higher in stocks.
5755 2018-10-12 03:06:52 then you also know that the stock market is not a complete picture of the economy either, 30% of the TSX is O&G & mining, 34% is financials... we know where oil is and interest rates which affects financial stocks are rising. And then there is Trump

5765 2018-10-12 03:01:48 It’s actually a lot more complex than that.  I’m not going to do your homework for you, but do a little more research on the bonds, tech stocks, & China for starters...
5766 2018-10-12 03:01:37 I wouldn't call it tanking just yet. It is seeing a dip and if it continues that way for a while, then it will be tanking, but its too early to tell. Just look at the Dow from June 11th to June 27th of this year. It bounced back from that. Sometimes a correction in stocks is due.
5767 2018-10-12 03:01:24 Buying and owning stocks represents "hope." No one likes to see it crushed.

5786 2018-10-12 02:55:34 You compared bitcoin to gold while stating bitcoin moved lockstep with stocks when gold did the opposite.

Also you can’t have a monetary system with a fixed supply. That’s deflationary and no one lends in a deflation environment. You’re welcome and ditto! 
5787 2018-10-12 02:55:30 Marek, what makes you so sure if that. If mkt participants ARE  rotating out of growth stocks into value plays, when has value investing ever driven mkts higher.? Particularly in a late cycle bull..? :)
5788 2018-10-12 02:54:18 Also I don't think taking more money away from the average Indian is the right way to see it. A country where some 2-5% owning stocks, it's anything but average. Also no-one is forced to enter into markets.
5789 2018-10-12 02:54:06 While everyone is talking about the huge on-going sale on Amazon & Flipkart, I see a bigger sale & discount on the stock market.

5793 2018-10-12 02:51:34 When they reverse course, it means rate cuts, it means the end of #QT, but it also means a return to #QE on steroids. The #Fed will be the ultimate buyer of USTs imho. Hence why I believe bonds and stocks rise together (yields fall) but the dollar will pay the price.
5794 2018-10-12 02:51:15 Stocks plunge once again today ... Dow -550 points as investors shun risk.
5795 2018-10-12 02:49:32 get used to it, if youve traded stocks you can see crypto is no different

5798 2018-10-12 02:47:51 It shows a lot of hedging against more downside in stocks (fear).  Extremes can help identify inflection points.... speaks to odds.

5827 2018-10-12 02:35:53 True, but those are the stocks that lead up trends. So for me, a lack of growth names meeting that criteria is a red flag and has been a big tell in the past.  So I will look at any bounce as suspect as long as that condition exists.

5836 2018-10-12 02:28:36 Imo. Incorrect statement. 
First, people need to understand that the stock market is inefficient when it comes to valuing stocks. Hence overall market is usually overvalued or undervalued but not fairly valued. Market sentiment powers the push to either side.

5837 2018-10-12 02:27:30 Just reviewed 479 charts from S&P and NDX. No long/short setups, as all are extended to the downside. Perhaps 15 began showing signs of a positive divergence, retailers $GPS $HD $TGT $CMG, staples $JNJ $KHC $PEP, and a few REITS, so faint improvement #stocks
5838 2018-10-12 02:27:16 Agree it was the fed and funds expecting lower returns from debt ridden growth stocks.

5874 2018-10-12 02:13:50 WAYFARER COOPERATIVE stocks slump
5875 2018-10-12 02:13:39 apple stocks rise by 69%.
5876 2018-10-12 02:12:47 Point of sale stock brokers with good advice don't have as much power as they did 20 years ago because people buy and sell stocks themselves these days all chaotic.
5877 2018-10-12 02:12:37 That's why this boomer is sticking with the anti stock market: Canadian Pot Stocks!
5878 2018-10-12 02:12:23 Now @jimcramer you said you were t recommending Chinese stocks:)
5879 2018-10-12 02:12:16 For all my efforts at staying green I suddenly find myself in the red albeit in some very good #CAMJ stocks sure to that blaze a new trail $ALEF $PREV $TRUL $PYX need to p/u some $TGOD & $TRST Wishing everyone a green day tomorrow 
5880 2018-10-12 02:11:30 The market decline is fake news.  No one is reporting the stocks that are going up.
5881 2018-10-12 02:10:02 Stocks... You mean like soup base?
5882 2018-10-12 02:09:05 As of 10:05 a.m., PSEi 6,918.02 up 33.64 points or 0.49 percent #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
5883 2018-10-12 02:08:34 Feb 2018 was the first and much needed breather after the huge 2017 bull run. This one comes after a divergent like new high that took just couple months to form with many individual stocks extremely extended. In an intraday chart this looks exhaustion , IM humble O 
5884 2018-10-12 02:08:24 The better strategy is clearly "buy stocks that don't go down".
5885 2018-10-12 02:07:30 Also, gasoline stocks are at record high for this time of the year.

5887 2018-10-12 02:04:56 U.S. Market Check
U.S. stocks tumbled a second day, with major averages notching wild swings in heavy volume.The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 3.146 percent.
5888 2018-10-12 02:04:55 I eat mint cookie & cream ice cream almost every day. Ima buy stocks in Ben&Jerry.
5889 2018-10-12 02:04:46 This time for opportunities to mump more money for long-term prospective of good stocks like Bajaj finance.. Eicher motors ..Pageind ....Etc more to come
5890 2018-10-12 02:04:44 While stocks in Japan and Australia added to this week’s losses, South  Korean equities rose and futures signalled gains for China, after the  Shanghai Composite slumped to a four-year low.
5891 2018-10-12 02:04:02 My gut tells my that most loyal Fox News viewers don’t invest in stocks.  Just a hunch.
5892 2018-10-12 02:02:30 Just because I am invested in Marijuana Stocks and support Cannabis doesn’t make me a “Pot head”. You can call me “your Highness” !! 
5893 2018-10-12 02:01:52 Yes, except for me there's an overriding rule that says any stock I buy falls through the floor. Indeed, someone following my purchases could make a fortune by selling short whatever I buy. My pot stocks, e.g., immediately lost 50%.
5894 2018-10-12 02:01:40 Check market crash in last 2 days in dow. 
My concern is MAINLY due to these stocks u mentioned. They can fall MUCH more than broader markets. To me they seem to be in a bubble zone. 
Just my opinion, can ALWAYS be wrong.
5895 2018-10-12 02:01:15 Also stocks in the US are now generally owned by a handful of people rather than virtually everyone like it was back in the 20s. So a crash in the market doesn't really effect all that many. But the press always likes to make the comparison to stir panic.
5896 2018-10-12 02:01:13 Going long defense stocks and oil.  That is one way to pump up the markets.
5897 2018-10-12 02:00:25 I’m sure wherever he is, he’s still bitching with a smile at sellers of his stocks :)
5898 2018-10-12 01:59:22 updated redrum with new stocks :)
5899 2018-10-12 01:58:36 45: I make mighty economy!
<stocks are up>
45: it's all me, toldya so
<stocks are down>
45: the stupid federal reserve ruined everything by charging banks interest on their loans! We can't keep winning if we don't have all your money! Vote R next month!

5901 2018-10-12 01:58:31 Greenspan was growing the money supply by 8% in the early to mid 1990s, and  exchange requirements for earnings were lowered(low quality stocks were then listed)....internet bubble

5903 2018-10-12 01:57:55 Are they? Because from where we sit ... its okay to sexually assault women, partner with Russians to win elections, and buy stocks as a Senator if you have inside knowledge. But do go on ....
5904 2018-10-12 01:57:38 Lmao someone teach me about stocks because I have no idea how to read my investment portfolio lmaooo
5905 2018-10-12 01:57:12 I am up in 2 weeks but down this week slightly. Holding cannabis and cancer and digital exchange stocks. All have fared ok. Carnage is in tech but American core economy from retail to banks to autos to real estate is bankrupt for a few years.
5906 2018-10-12 01:57:05 You have also been saying for weeks to stay away from Chinese stocks.
5907 2018-10-12 01:56:29 But in which stocks??
5908 2018-10-12 01:55:55 Bought stocks for the first time and it was the worst day for the stock market in 2 years... ooops
5909 2018-10-12 01:55:15 And to think insurance stocks making new highs, just got my auto premium, WTF
5910 2018-10-12 01:55:04 About time. This is stupid. China’s stocks market has been pummeled. The USA is not Immune to the same fate. Economies are connected and interrelated.
5911 2018-10-12 01:55:04 BREAKING: There's something going on with the markets, so you should buy some stocks and sell others on a case-to-case basis. Basically, as you were!
5912 2018-10-12 01:54:34 But then, our stocks still green no matter what :)))
5913 2018-10-12 01:54:21 Better lucky than good haha. Are you a full time trader?
5914 2018-10-12 01:53:29 Worst is buying already outperformed stocks in a bull run hoping still lot of juice left
5915 2018-10-12 01:52:25 How is that Boycott asking for a homie who own Nike’s stocks
5916 2018-10-12 01:52:00 They got it throwing it at .com stocks that increased exponentially daily
5917 2018-10-12 01:51:51 Can robots buy stocks?
5918 2018-10-12 01:51:45 Now if the stocks rebound from this. It's not Trump's doing but Obama's. Right?
5919 2018-10-12 01:51:43 There will more likely than not be a dead cat bounce in the morning. #StockMarket #WallStreet #stocks
5920 2018-10-12 01:51:41 Lmao you didn’t say anything when the stocks were rising but you’re one of the first to speak when they fall
5921 2018-10-12 01:51:40 268 stocks in the S&P 500 more than 15% off their 52-week high,
5922 2018-10-12 01:51:39 Join the club. Spiraling stocks, the economy is not as strong as you think.
5923 2018-10-12 01:50:57 Didn’t you liquidate all your stocks 2 years ago and thus missed out on a two year stock rally? I’m gonna call that pretty dumb and heartbreaking.
5924 2018-10-12 01:49:51 Same here. Stocks mean nothing to me. My pay check seems to be shrinking with costs of goods and services rising. 
5925 2018-10-12 01:49:44 It’s more of an Federal Reserve thing than import/export thing. They may be raising interest levels a little sooner than needed. Google and Facebook(and like companies)stocks have been going down.
5926 2018-10-12 01:49:40 @Chrisdm91 gun doesn’t fire automatically. I am against bump stocks bc tbh you add a bump stock & the shot becomes inaccurate. I can’t explain why anyone would want to go to the trouble to add one when my shot literally becomes off with a bump stock. 6, for those who hog hunt
5927 2018-10-12 01:47:56 Sometimes it’s your only investment and you can live in it! Try that with stocks!
5928 2018-10-12 01:46:06 @StocksToTrade Having issues with STT loading all it says is "error retrieving data" and support hasn't been helping, really need to fix this ASAP
5929 2018-10-12 01:45:20 Today: NY and Naz 52w lows continued to increase as the S&P and Naz moved lower. We are looking for a divergence between the subsurface of the mkt and the surface (the avgs)

NY lows: 513 vs 479 Wed
Naz lows: 384 vs 325 Wed

Hi Naz volume and range yday & 2day r a plus #stocks
5930 2018-10-12 01:44:58 Totally agree, I think my stocks should go up, and every other stock should go down
5931 2018-10-12 01:44:35 @jimcramer can you please give me your take on these cannabis stocks???  Particularly Aurora (ACBFF)
5932 2018-10-12 01:44:27 In other words, tell grandma to put her life savings in stocks right before the crash so Rupert Murdock can make money on the crash.
5933 2018-10-12 01:44:21 Need to add stocks on my portfolio para bumababa average ko. Hahahah
5934 2018-10-12 01:44:13 As of 9:40 a.m., PSEi 6,856.65 down 27.73 points or 0.40 percent #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
5935 2018-10-12 01:44:10 50s stocks are up !!! I love to see that shit 50
5936 2018-10-12 01:43:35 A licensed esthetician in our FB Good Neighbors group just told us it was a good time to buy stocks.
5937 2018-10-12 01:43:10 I've been investing for ~10 years and only trading/watching the markets closer for <2 years so my normal is the Canadian cannabis markets 
5938 2018-10-12 01:42:39 The tech stocks, overhyped, overvalued, and too tied to a sinking Chinese economy, are what lead his drop.

As you can see by the other comments, there is no shortage of idiots thinking it affirms some political view they hold.  This is wrong.
5939 2018-10-12 01:42:30 All these stocks going down seems so unfair.
5940 2018-10-12 01:42:27 Got a 20 in stocks
5941 2018-10-12 01:42:24 The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) rose 0.8 percent in after-hours trading, while the Invesco QQQ Trust — which tracks the top 100 stocks in the Nasdaq Composite — jumped 1 percent.
5942 2018-10-12 01:42:23 My closing "green" stocks:   SODE .10 +40%....DIRV .009 +13.9%....RLBD .059 +5%....PAOG .002 +5%....GGTTF .81 +2.4%
5943 2018-10-12 01:41:10 Big day for bank stocks tomorrow with the earnings release of JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Citi
5944 2018-10-12 01:40:58 Who cares? Some people make money when stocks are up. Some make money when stocks are down. And some make money when interest rates go up. Stocks can't always be high. They must come down at some point or no one makes money. Don't they teach this in school anymore?
5945 2018-10-12 01:40:51 If i go trade stocks what platform do u recomend?
5946 2018-10-12 01:40:49 Yes good plan.... Let’s hope we can all retire early with these pot stocks....lol It’s just nice that we finally have something in Canada to invest in...been a while since I invested in any Canadian stock
5947 2018-10-12 01:40:43 I just searched for “stocks” on Twitter. Everything about the drop in the last few days was political - blaming Trump - and not even a hint of insight or actual thought. This political climate is much worse than I feared.
5948 2018-10-12 01:40:15 And yes basically only holding for the buy out rumours I think they eventually get taken out, along with $OGI $APH etc. Most of these companies not in the top 7 will be dead in 3-4 years. Then the story will be US cannabis which I'm already positioning for
5949 2018-10-12 01:40:02 First step to investing: put your money anywhere other than cash. 
 ETFS, stocks, bonds, real estate, even a CD is better than cash. 

Keeping your money in cash means losing average of 3% a year.

Doesn't sound like a lot but it means your money loses half its value over 20 yrs.
5950 2018-10-12 01:39:53 Can someone teach me about the stock market and how to invest in stocks?
5951 2018-10-12 01:39:19 @RichieFirth @bushontheradio Richie just ask Kiosk Dave if he stocks creme eggs now
5952 2018-10-12 01:39:19 At a minimum Amazon should offer them free access to all of the ebooks it stocks so as to facilitate the creation of even more and better content, a clear win-win.
5953 2018-10-12 01:39:00 Always another deal! Always another white whale. I am trying to not fall in love with these and just keep the cash register flowing.
5954 2018-10-12 01:38:17 Quick question how much in your opinion do rising rates contract multiple even for “value” stocks as interest rates increase. Where does the outperformance come from? Multiple expansion or accelerated earnings growth?
5955 2018-10-12 01:38:15 Claim olive oil, worth more than gold ;) friction at oil stocks
5956 2018-10-12 01:37:59 Maritime is interesting. I invest in military industrial; not a great day for stocks except textron (for myself). Any new sub tech stocks you recommend? I love LMT Raytheon etc. as an international edm dj I encounter ppl daily, globally, & find respect as well
5957 2018-10-12 01:37:02 So ballpark, how many people appeared in your mentions to explain stocks to you?
5958 2018-10-12 01:35:36 Analysts can sit and decide whether to suggest retail to buy or sell finally. It's like vendor selection process. Whoever submits lowest quotation, gets selected. With stocks, whoever provides higher target.... 
5959 2018-10-12 01:35:25 yeah cause you screwed over the stock market!  WTH is up with stocks plunging? oh that's right Trump!  #trumpnotpotus
5960 2018-10-12 01:35:18 I like reading finance news just because I like to.
But when the markets are acting like this, I don’t even bother reading news tbh. The articles that many of these financial medias write and so forth are just wack. Lol 
#trading #stocks #stockmarket
5961 2018-10-12 01:34:23 October 12, 2018: PSEi opened at 6,872.89 #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
5962 2018-10-12 01:34:14 That’s the right mindset. Pretty minor red day compared to a lot of others stocks in the same space. Give $eve.v some time.
5963 2018-10-12 01:34:13 Also, its not your country.  Were you a wise spotter of anything at all, you might understand that our version of your RRSPs are often invested in stocks.

I don't think "posting videos" makes you very wise.  Nor does it make you a scientist.
5964 2018-10-12 01:33:11 im gonna short the MF stocks  like never then move 2 VN with the loot :))))
5965 2018-10-12 01:32:28 Good time to buy bollard stocks
5966 2018-10-12 01:32:20 The school district, the girls, their parents, everyone involved in this fiasco, should be forced to endure exactly what he was subjected to since they refuse to bring back the stocks. Or public floggings.
5967 2018-10-12 01:31:19 Even after this week, the majority of stocks tied to major indexes are still grossly overvalued

be careful out there, kids.
5968 2018-10-12 01:31:02 Saw that. Makes my purchase today even better though I don't plan on holding this too long. Only as long as it makes me money. I have been in them for a year already, this was an add in my trading account
5969 2018-10-12 01:29:59 I'll diversify when they pry my cold dead hands off my GSE stocks ;)
5970 2018-10-12 01:29:45 Real #Love Begins where nothing is expected in return...

5971 2018-10-12 01:29:40 Yeah Kelly and Quaynor especially Quaynors stocks have risen this year originally thought around 30 now could be in the teens!!
5972 2018-10-12 01:29:37 It was the tech stocks that led the loss and fell deepest.  They'll all be back as a result of the holidays.

As to your tainting it as an act for the morbid, you're wrong and venal, if not ignorant.

These equities are broadly held in retirement and pension plans.
5973 2018-10-12 01:29:20 Watching some NFL action for a while, sipping some green tea, recharging after being out in the rain, wondering if most stocks will drop more on friday?
5974 2018-10-12 01:28:05 Replace Elon with anyone is a mistake. Wall Street doesn’t care for anyone or thing except movements that generate sales of stocks for commissions. Let Elon run the most innovative car company in America. People forget Tesla is an American company.
5975 2018-10-12 01:27:40 "stocks fluctuate"
5976 2018-10-12 01:27:01 When are they gonna make America (stocks) great again? Asking for all the Robinhood accounts out there sucking wind $spy
5977 2018-10-12 01:26:28 That’s hilarious coming from someone who probably has money in stocks or a 401k. I’m sure you aren’t complaining about the extra money they’re making you. But go ahead and bash the GOP. You’re quite the hypocrite and quite often.
5978 2018-10-12 01:25:30 The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 831.83 points, or 3.1 percent, to 25,598.74. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks shed 46.45 points, or 2.9 percent, to 1,575.4   wait till april when those tax cuts come in lol.
5979 2018-10-12 01:25:00 Two things I love most: When Wall Street freaks out and stocks go on clearance and McRib season at McDonald’s...not necessarily in that order.
5980 2018-10-12 01:24:24 I believe the bump stocks and/or high capacity rifles used in Vegas, Sandy Hook, Parkland and other mass shootings that slaughtered innocent Americans were legally obtained.
5981 2018-10-12 01:23:53 First News 12 October 2018 - US stocks lower, PSEi at new low for the year -1.66% to 6884 (14.5x), S&P/EM, GIR, Foreign Portfolio Net Outflow, Rice Tarrification, PHL GDP, Auto - GTCAP, AC, Energy - MER, AP, MPI, GTCAP, PSALM, NGCP, AP, CLC, MPI, CLI, SM, SMPH, BDO, CHIB
5982 2018-10-12 01:23:24 Time to buy
Fundamentals are still strong 
Fund managers moving to bond market dragging stocks down
They will be back
5983 2018-10-12 01:23:00 Time to start buying lower priced stocks.
5984 2018-10-12 01:22:43 I'm just impressed that my stocks are negative for the year.
5985 2018-10-12 01:22:19 I have stocks and bonds. Her father wants to go fishing with me and he don’t even like fishing.
5986 2018-10-12 01:21:13 Sorry to break this to you, Liberals but $BILLIONS of Insurance Company Dollars will be flooding our economy in order to put these people back into their homes & businesses, causing the DOW to JUMP at least the 1,000 points they just lost.

BUY STOCKS NOW & thank me later.
5987 2018-10-12 01:21:12 Lucky bastard. I got some British bank worth 5 bucks I sold the other day.  I've got mostly solar, weed and super cheap biotech stocks that are basically lottery tickets.
5988 2018-10-12 01:21:09 I very much relate. Have to say though, I first read stocks as 'socks' and was very confused.. 
5989 2018-10-12 01:21:08 Please make it available w/lots of stocks at Lazada for people who live in provinces or better yet make it available in major malls here in North Luzon.please.
5990 2018-10-12 01:20:57 Yet look how well the pot stocks have held up during the blood bath the last two days...
5991 2018-10-12 01:20:41 Yes, $SNE is on my radar!
I'm moving with momentum now, hence the selection of stocks I am now holding.

5993 2018-10-12 01:20:02 Oooo, tin foil stocks prices are about to go up!!! 
5994 2018-10-12 01:19:10 Kanye spoke his truth. Trump is ending the Korean War, signed ANWR, Jerusalem Embassy, ISIS gone, Iran weakened, China on their heels, NAFTA replaced with better deal, unprecedented growth in economy, jobs, stocks, & manufacturing. NFL In Canada, Right to Try, Save Our Seas Act!
5995 2018-10-12 01:18:08 first thing imma do when i get me some money from blowing up is invest in stocks and buy 5 new wigs
5996 2018-10-12 01:17:54 That’s all any school stocks up on at Vcu they do got a littler more variety
5997 2018-10-12 01:17:51 But Jim, just the other day I thought you called $BABA and other Chinese stocks "toxic?"
5998 2018-10-12 01:17:06 Crypto and Stocks are on sale and I’m out of fiat! Doh! 
5999 2018-10-12 01:17:06 Along time ago my daughter bought a few speculative penny stocks but the others I’d have to ask. There are about half dozen or so big players who invested early when medical cannabis approved. Followed the development because we knew eventually it would be BIG!
6000 2018-10-12 01:16:48 Facebook is not a business it’s a scam, and scams generally end up being penny stocks.
6001 2018-10-12 01:16:07 I don’t know Steven but back in February there were individual stocks to trade long side , this time around every thing in the woodshed!
6002 2018-10-12 01:15:15 I mean,  you can invest as little as you want, all it does is let you buy stocks without a commission.  So like,  most of the pot company stocks are between 2 and 50 bucks right now.  As long as you have enough for the stock, you're good.
6003 2018-10-12 01:15:10 People always ask why im broke. Nigga i buy stocks and food leave me alone. Gotta get this paper for the future.-VSU
6004 2018-10-12 01:15:00 I think a lot of ppl take the 200dma for granted. And tbh is hard to say hey I'd short it. Stocks really don't spend much time under it. But we can still wash pretty far is a week or so.
6005 2018-10-12 01:14:24 Q: With the stock market dropping 1300 this week what do you recommend?
A: There is no simple answer but I would recommend that you don’t just panic and sell all your stocks.
6006 2018-10-12 01:14:13 Less than half of Americans own stock. And the majority of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 1%. It’s never been a good indicator of overall economic success in this country. Food prices are soaring. Gas is higher. All goods higher bc of the trade war with China. Winning
6007 2018-10-12 01:13:38 Stocks look like they just found out who's president
6008 2018-10-12 01:12:12 We talking penny stocks oorrrr
6009 2018-10-12 01:12:08 You said you don’t buy Chinese stocks due to the China trade war

6015 2018-10-12 01:10:21 My stocks haven’t budged and somehow I’ve lost 14 bucks after market 
6016 2018-10-12 01:09:57 I think tech stocks are more valuable than crypto and will be in the future. As AI gets better, less and less need for medium of exchange.
6017 2018-10-12 01:09:52 Stocks are in the shitter and I’m pissed.
6018 2018-10-12 01:09:45 i think our dollar is crap at the moment. So i wouldnt buy us stocks. 

I think ill buy more bns tomarrow as my money didnt transfer over tonight. 4.7% yield is sweet!
6019 2018-10-12 01:09:39 I agree man... This is why I moved into stocks motre than talking games. I'm not too happy with the direction most games are headed

Maybe we need a VR focus Next Gen with far deeper games
6020 2018-10-12 01:09:19 My life lately has just consisted of watching stocks drop and fall. It’s pretty fun, ya never know what’ll happen
6021 2018-10-12 01:09:04 Yes sir, and information technology stocks sored and their financial infastructure can provide accommodation for American artists.  We do not inflate our economy, we adapt and move forward for happiness, love and privacy.   We can do this.  Thank you I.T.

6024 2018-10-12 01:08:00 There is nothing more powerful and bullish in stock markets than when deep value stocks are coupled with price momentum. The value trap is converted into a trending stock. This has just happened in the South African gold stocks. Up 9% in 1 day! #goldshares #gold #

6026 2018-10-12 01:07:15 Didn't know the media stocks alcoholic drinks in offices and are allowed to drink at work. Is that why so much of fiction is passed of as analysis by the media?

6027 2018-10-12 01:06:54 Prefer to go long or sit on the side with cash in bearish times. I don’t like to pay for locate fees. I have shorted ETB stocks for profit as recently as yesterday, but I would rather look for good longs which why I am cautious in the short term. Cautious doesn’t mean paralyses

DJT was elected & been POTUS 4 ~2yrs.

Today he signed 2 bipartisan bills with 100% support.

REJOICE!

But

Tomorrow Donald Trump will go down.

6034 2018-10-12 01:04:37 You know what @RobinhoodApp should do? Put an open chat feed on every stock to allow people to talk about trading. Just like you can now do with the #cryptocurrency. You should do this @RobinhoodApp ;)

6035 2018-10-12 01:04:14 Stock market shake off tactic - some of us noticed that stocks are made to plunge for no apparent reason and later after the mom and pops have sold these stocks, the stock then goes way up. The rich are shaking poorer owners off the stocks off, "like a dog shaking off fleas."
6036 2018-10-12 01:02:52 What’s the parameters of slow stocks? Ty
6037 2018-10-12 01:00:50 So you think this stock goes the highest if it’s not bought out? I’m a newbie to investing In stocks but was able to grab a bunch of shares before the results came out.
6038 2018-10-12 01:00:19 Stocks, unlike idiocy, are limited.
6039 2018-10-12 01:00:10 If stocks tank I just want the yield on the 10 yr T note to drop again. Mortgage rates would follow.
6040 2018-10-12 00:59:40 Unfortunately I I can invest in individual stocks and I invested in SHLD, I thought it was a sure thing. I just checked it’s down to 0.34 cents a share which means I lost $132,000.00. My wife is going to kill me :(
6041 2018-10-12 00:59:23 Nike stocks nearly $75 for those who wanted to buy. But I guess the Nike hype is gone so is the interest 
6042 2018-10-12 00:58:06 Right........Over 600,000 babies killed every year in the US compared to over 15,000 gun related deaths every year in the US (not even 50% of this number related to guns that use bump stocks)... you were saying what should be the bigger issue?
6043 2018-10-12 00:57:55 Gov Phil Bresden also had good ideas to protect our children from gun murders in school by  taking guns away from mentally ill and pre screening for gun ownership and banning bump stocks while strengthening 2nd Amendment right.  Marsha’s, I am A rating
6044 2018-10-12 00:57:41 Luckily I inform people about negative aspect of numerous stocks ... $WEED $CGC is one at times ... $TGOD $XLY.V $ACB $CHOO.C plus many many others ... nothing bitter about me ...
6045 2018-10-12 00:56:02 You had any stocks work out for you yet?
6046 2018-10-12 00:55:21 You're right about pension & large amount of baby boomers. BUT-once they began initiating 401k's is when Employer provided pensions stopped & focus began on stocks. Now co's must pay big mgmt salaries & bonuses, then stockholders. 0 left for worker pay increase = Income disparity
6047 2018-10-12 00:54:52 I'd like to see @SenSanders , @SenKamalaHarris @SenWarren call for the end of corporations buying back stocks. It manipulates the market, diverts money from wages and investment. Wage stagnation began when they were made legal under Reagan.
6048 2018-10-12 00:54:42 Exactly. Stocks should be buy & hold. You don’t panic-sell on a 2-day fall.
6049 2018-10-12 00:54:01 I don’t agree. When the market fell in 08, I stayed in stocks while others sold off at a huge loss. When the market came back I got to ride it back up. It’s hard to time when yo jump back in but I did much better holding than my colleagues did selling.
6050 2018-10-12 00:53:53 Also can you explain what makes gold / silver stocks on now when there are other stocks with breakouts today as well, is it because gold stocks are all breaking out together?
6051 2018-10-12 00:53:23 That Trump wasn't critical of the same Fed policy while stocks were rising.
6052 2018-10-12 00:53:14 Guess you don’t dabble in stocks then?
6053 2018-10-12 00:52:38 Awesome. I wasn’t able to find on google but did on yahoo stocks. Now I know they’re called heat maps! Ty.
6054 2018-10-12 00:52:15 That's okay Whoever has stocks and texted a lost a lot of money cuz the Dow dropped
6055 2018-10-12 00:52:04 You seriously think the present day inflation environment is the same as the 1970s? It is not the Fed's job to bull up stocks, but neither is it their job to tank the economy into a recession fo no reason. US govt real interest rates are already highest in developing world.
6056 2018-10-12 00:51:27 @jimcramer should we forget about Cannabis stocks and focus on tech opportunity?
6057 2018-10-12 00:51:13 Matthew-I think you should develop a dividend stock checklist.
Establish your own criteria and refine it over time.  Then rate some stocks using your criteria.
6058 2018-10-12 00:50:47 Every day for the last two years: “Market seems overvalued.” “Equities are frothy.” “We may be due for a correction.” This week: “OH MY GOD STOCKS ARE DIVING!”

6060 2018-10-12 00:50:27 I’m reminded today after the 2nd day of stock meltdown that mental health of people who invest heavily in stocks is important 

If you know of someone who trades stocks talk to them b/c they’re in financial crisis from the last 2 days of losses

6061 2018-10-12 00:49:41 urbanization, population growth, lack of land, tightening lending rules in most economies in a housing bubble, pension plans full of bank stocks. i dunno man, i think governments will want to create sideways rather than a lasting correction. there's always gems out there.
6062 2018-10-12 00:49:40 I was waiting for my “You’re going to be okay, girl” email from @Vanguard_Group and they didn’t let me down. Cause, honey them stocks...
6063 2018-10-12 00:49:36 I say US stocks you’re interested in.. 1) the market is down so good time to buy and 2) I only know US stocks so I can’t advise on Canadian stocks 
6064 2018-10-12 00:49:30 I had about $100,000 in stocks in an employee savings plan. Lost it all in the Bush economic crash with two kids in college an no decent employment prospects. The stock market is irrelevant to me for the rest of my life. It's mostly a separate economy for corporations and the 10%
6065 2018-10-12 00:49:23 Soon their stocks are going to be worth.... ten cents
6066 2018-10-12 00:49:02 I’m shocked to hear that The Bitcoin Channel is discussing stocks.
6067 2018-10-12 00:48:39 Stocks Should We Buy On Spot Or Sell To Find The Bottom? I Was Predicting A Correction And Expecting About 3% And Almost 6% Was A Surprise.

6070 2018-10-12 00:47:53 However theres no good alternative other then investing in land as interest rates have dropped so bad...in 80's I had money in CD's getting 12-14 pct interest..today? Not worth it so moneys been going into stocks and land (bubble burst)
6071 2018-10-12 00:47:12 You need moderate stocks and risky.
6072 2018-10-12 00:46:22 In #ia03 debate, both @YoungForIowa and @Axne4Congress talk about violence being a problem and agree on banning gun bump stocks. "It's hard to legislate away evil," says @YoungForIowa.
6073 2018-10-12 00:46:21 It’s never easy to accept when things don’t behave as expect them too. It’s a market of individual stocks and the $bit market is a healthy one. Personally still bullish another green day and a strong VWAP - GL though :)
6074 2018-10-12 00:46:16 the FANG stocks took a huge lose yesterday .

6075 2018-10-12 00:46:08 I own amazon. Love it. What do you think of GE. I have made good money on GE in the past. I am looking st them now. As for M stocks. Someone is going to make money. Corona already buying in Coca Cola looking.
6076 2018-10-12 00:45:51 So Today many stocks have a far greater number of shares issued then in 1980's  And their simply overpriced.. when a real crash happens that weight of extra shares will drop many down like a rock
6077 2018-10-12 00:45:41 The number of people "investing" in $TSLA bc of ideological reasons is alarming. One thing I will credit @elonmusk for is the cult like following he has generated. Other supposed "clean energy stocks" don't generate this type of hype. $TSLA is a zero.
6078 2018-10-12 00:45:24 Let the overpaid under informed talking heads and empty suits at Fox be the first to buy stocks.
6079 2018-10-12 00:44:25 Putting aside your asinine notion I'm ok with kids being murdered because I disagree, I'll tell you why you make no sense. Bump stocks have been used in 1 mass shooting. More are killed per year by knives, hands and feet, and pistols. Bump fire can be done by hand or with a belt

6082 2018-10-12 00:42:41 Many stocks these days are Over priced, For example to keep say MSFT attractive in price  as its value moved up towards 100 the company went through splits 2-1 3-1 3-1 2-1 etc so now theres a Huge amount of MSFT stocks  vis a vis how many issued in 87 when it was around $50
6083 2018-10-12 00:42:39 Q: Should bump-stock ban be put into place? 
@YoungForIowa: I'm for getting rid of bump stocks. Also need to upgrade mental health and fix the background check system, plugging holes. #IA03 #IPTVDebate @KCCINews
6084 2018-10-12 00:42:35 Depends. Corps don't pay taxes and many did help employees. All corps aren't bad. Time will tell if investments will end up helping the deficit. Hard to say. Stocks are over rated. Don't think it is a smart thing to brag about that. Most people aren't invested anyway.

6087 2018-10-12 00:41:47 I did the same during the crash & it worked out well in the end. But since then I’ve added some stocks that are higher risk. It’s mainly those stocks I’ve been trimming, but sticking with my high conviction investments. You’re right about timing, it’s hard to get right, out & in.
6088 2018-10-12 00:41:32 The migration to web browsers like @Brave that block ads, popups and trackers could not be having an effect on social media tech stocks, right! Do it and do it now!
6089 2018-10-12 00:41:29 $SPY $QQQ $DJIA After midterm elections pass, stocks have done very well historically. According to Lynch, "since 1946 S&P 500 has never been down 12 months following. That means we may have just entered best nine-month period for stocks in entire four-year presidential cycle."
6090 2018-10-12 00:40:26 The only time Obama suggested “now is a good time to buy stocks” was exactly when the market hit bottom in March 2009. Meanwhile, Trump hypes every upward move Iike a penny stock promoter, then disappears when the market tumbles as a result of his trade policies killing profits.

6098 2018-10-12 00:37:48 Hi Jim, 
you are my inspiration when it comes to stocks.
Many, many thanks for your wisdom and courage! 
Especially in the craziest time like now.
6099 2018-10-12 00:37:24 Less than 10% of $SPX stocks, over their 5 ema, 10 ema and 20 ema.....get ready for a RIP YOUR FACE rally...............soon, very soon.......no time to be SHORT anything....nothing
6100 2018-10-12 00:37:22 We can both agree on that! The average American seems to het both ends of the stick—when stocks are high, companies pay stockholders (trickling up), but when they fall, the layoffs, benefit cuts, and wage cuts trickle down!
6101 2018-10-12 00:35:04 You mean stocks right?? ///
6102 2018-10-12 00:34:23 It is. The Fed is raising rates to curb possibility of inflation. Which is wrong-headed given models show inflation is unlikely. The tariff fight with China isn’t at issue with the sell-off of tech stocks and bank stocks. Bank stocks always take a hit when Fed raises rates.
6103 2018-10-12 00:33:01 The left is desperate to win in November so much so that the Fed Reserve is increasing interest rates to tank stocks and the economy! Let that sink in. Don’t buy it, vote red in November!
6104 2018-10-12 00:32:10 Trump will go crazy making up excuses.    The Dems planted an “economy bomb” to detonate before the mid terms.  Soros and Bezos and Buffet working together.   ... the feds fault... China is dumping stocks to hurt him... just wait and enjoy
6105 2018-10-12 00:31:56 Yeah, we keep hearing about how strong and great the economy is doing and see the inflation you've described. And stocks and bonds are our retirement income and they are getting eaten away by what's happening on Wall Street.
6106 2018-10-12 00:31:27 Sucks, will be hard to buy the stocks I like. Have to buy yawners now $XOM $VZ $JPM
6107 2018-10-12 00:30:59 If you stand for life, you would ban bump stocks and AR-15s, you worthless ‘senator’
6108 2018-10-12 00:30:27 California Democrats think they run all of America. Thank heavins they don't. They tried to regulate Tech Stocks and we know the outcome of that in the past 2 days. The market started its free fall on Wednesday with the selloff of Teck Stocks. It has declined   by 1,500 points.
6109 2018-10-12 00:30:26 General Electronic stock has been hammered, dropping from $32 at the beginning of 2017 to a nine-year low near $11 late last month. But  $GE has a legacy product offering that is always in demand and it is chief among those defensive stocks I always reference
6110 2018-10-12 00:30:22 Good one Pomp.. but I think this is why crypto will get manipulated right along with the stock market. Can't have the nasdaq and s&p dumping and crypto rising. Crypto will dump right along with stocks. Gold may be safe tho. Crypto needs to decouple from the legacy system IMO.
6111 2018-10-12 00:30:14 It's simple, ma'am-if your rich in this country, today or own a major business, having stocks is good-if your middle class, well-thank Donald Trump and the Republican congress people for that
6112 2018-10-12 00:30:06 stock doesn't mean stocks of shares here.
6113 2018-10-12 00:29:11 @realDonaldTrump I don't own or understand stocks.

ask me how the economy is?
6114 2018-10-12 00:28:59 You may not invest in stocks, the market has an impact on your daily spending.  Unfortunately it has an impact on all the social programs.  As you continue your fight for Medicare/Medicaid keep an eye on the market, it impacts how much GOP will cut all benefits.

6121 2018-10-12 00:27:54 Normal for tech stocks to take a beating. Asia always find its competition are front row.
6122 2018-10-12 00:27:53 Yet, people can make a living going on television “explaining” why stocks went up or down. You can always find some reason for the fluctuation.
6123 2018-10-12 00:27:37 When the stock market is in the rise @realDonaldTrump pats himself on the back. Now that stocks are falling the past 2 days he is blaming the Feds. Hello! His federal reserve pick.
6124 2018-10-12 00:26:58 "When stocks selloff people come to  Real estate as safe investment" says the RE agent who lives on RE comms. These laughs are why I tune to @CP24 hot property than big bang theory at 7.30pm
6125 2018-10-12 00:26:52 better chill out soon. don’t know how much more these housing stocks can take ie XHB. And with the weaker CPI on used cars due to higher rates already
6126 2018-10-12 00:26:38 Congrats Trump, you finally beat Obama, $1400 loss in 2 days. You R A damn expert aren't you. Keeper up that's when folks will shit can your ass. The ones that has stock only voted for you because of tax cuts for rich driving stocks. Loose that and we'll loose you! Yahoooooooo!
6127 2018-10-12 00:26:23 Not really. It is in all likelihood a market correction. Many likely to see it as a buying opportunity. Tech stocks & interest rate worries drove it. Sky is not falling.
6128 2018-10-12 00:25:32 $SPY "going long on stocks"  Remember many will rise with the tide (market) but not all will continue higher. Be selective.
6129 2018-10-12 00:24:38 As much as I support the cause of gun control,  repealing 2A isn't the right way. Some people actually need guns.  And, the blowback would be disastrous. Instead, raise the age to 21. Prosecute parents if their guns are used.  Ban bump stocks, etc. It's complicated but doable.
6130 2018-10-12 00:24:29 How many people are killed by fully automatic weapon? Not AR-15s, but machine guns? They'er regulated, so aren't the gun of choice of mass shooters. No, they get semi-autos and use the bump stocks  endorsed by the NRA.
6131 2018-10-12 00:23:50 I’ve been actively trying to get my finances in order.  I have a basic ass will, life insurance,  a 401k , my credit score is good but could be better & im so excited about it.  Next i actually have to utilize my Robinhood app and buy some stocks.
6132 2018-10-12 00:23:15 I can explain stocks. Say you have money, if you let that money pretend to support a company for a few microseconds and then move it at just the right time to a different company, you can just have more money for no reason. Nothing productive happens, but capitalism rewards you.
6133 2018-10-12 00:23:14 Stocks will be back. I'm buying, not selling.
6134 2018-10-12 00:22:58 stuff happens. Normal mode is really just to try and obtain stocks and not necessarily mixup. She has a good DP, she has ways of forcing you to respect her (oki as well), she has consistent damage and unlike Valkenhayn she doesn't rely on meter for movement which constantly-
6135 2018-10-12 00:22:50 Let’s call the market today a nice little discount sale on Stocks. Once they are down low like today, then they go.....
6136 2018-10-12 00:22:33 When the government borrows money to run trillion dollar deficits it tihghtens the money supply, interest rates rise and stocks fall. The market is reacting to the GOP running up the national debt and deficit and tightening the money supply. Period.
6137 2018-10-12 00:22:28 Stocks are Gambling for the elite.  Wall St is a scam.
6138 2018-10-12 00:22:06 I believe the negative correlation will reinstate itself with cash fleeing stocks going into bonds. We aren’t there but it is coming.
6139 2018-10-12 00:21:53 Baby Care Plus Super Sale!! 
Hurry,  Limited Stocks only¡
6140 2018-10-12 00:20:50 Bump stocks increase the rate of fire. They do not make your gun automatic nor are they a substitute for full auto.
6141 2018-10-12 00:20:03 Scary for McConnell! We are building a custom set of stocks in front of the capital for old Mitch. Setting up a line 10 yards back for egg/vegetable throwing. He’s the turtle man, he eats anything. @senatemajldr
6142 2018-10-12 00:19:19 I see a lot of arguement of whether this is a correction or a crash? Two answers settle that debate. 1. Skyrocketing yields 2. Feds shedding a 4 Trillion balance sheet. If 30-50% is a correction to you then sure it’ll be a correction. #markets #DowJones #stocks #xrp #btc #forex
6143 2018-10-12 00:19:04 I was fortunate to have a teacher in high school give us a lesson on this.  We tracked our stocks in the local newspaper (1997!) and then reported back.  It was awesome.  #MasteryChat
6144 2018-10-12 00:18:58 Have you ever done a video on the rumour of WT armament stocks/shares? Lots of stuff up on XJW sites with screenshots of sources however unsure of credibility & not mentioned on JW survey/facts. Also some comments suggest these rumours are based on poor understanding of subject.
6145 2018-10-12 00:18:52 Markets in Europe fell as well, but not as much compared to the U.S. and Asia, seeing as stocks had already been declining for quite a while in that area.
6146 2018-10-12 00:18:50 So stocks are way down. Gas prices are way up. The deficits are huge. The Republicans want to cut out your medicare and social security and your healthcare. And people vote for them because?............
6147 2018-10-12 00:18:45 Crazy day in stocks market 
6148 2018-10-12 00:18:42 Ok let's be serious here. Re: stocks - Granted, but this is elevated by OD. This however does NOT mean that she is reliant on OD to start playing the game. GA w/o stock still provides many functions for her given the movement it possesses, and she can use this to 'start playing'
6149 2018-10-12 00:18:41 To be financially secure, you have to "play to not lose"

To become wealthy, you have to "play to win"

That means taking calculated risks with accelerated strategies

Such as building a business, value investing (stocks, real estate, etc) 

Or take a high-earning career path.
6150 2018-10-12 00:18:30 Huh. We don’t own derivatives? We own stocks bonds mutual funds and ETFs. We super rarely buy options for clients or use margin. We’re conservative mostly.
6151 2018-10-12 00:18:14 Stocks and Crypto dying together it seems, what happened to the crypto hedge?
6152 2018-10-12 00:16:42 I like the stocks lol
6153 2018-10-12 00:15:55 @FOXSports whoever came up with that intro segment with the stocks should be reprimanded.
6154 2018-10-12 00:15:51 People have been so worried about a flat yield curve signaling a recession... if you look, the reason that signals anything negative is because the steepening that follows is historically negative for stocks..
6155 2018-10-12 00:15:04 I am long stocks, bonds and gold here and short usdjpy.. CPI should help risk parity trade bounce meaningfully
6156 2018-10-12 00:14:52 Similar to the U.S., China’s tech stocks were hit hard. Chinese social media and gaming company Tencent TCEHY and smartphone maker Xiaomi fell 6% and 8%, respectively
6157 2018-10-12 00:14:48 Stocks !
6158 2018-10-12 00:14:39 The matter involved is penny stock. I know lot of people involved in LTCG penny stocks transactions. It is way to do money laundering
6159 2018-10-12 00:14:38 @MarketWatch online has a program where students can build “portfolios” of stocks to watch. Throughout the lessons Ss use their knowledge to research and decide what to buy/sell. I gave them each “100,000” to start.
6160 2018-10-12 00:13:43 Precious childhood memories that are better investments than many blue chip stocks. Best thing of all...They put smiles on peoples faces!
6161 2018-10-12 00:13:18 stocks are low as shit rn jesus christ
6162 2018-10-12 00:13:14 #3500EDGELuigi it also appears that Trump's tariff policies have caused the negative market trends. U.S. tech companys' stocks have fallen dramatically over the past several days partially due to the unrest of our relationship with China.
6163 2018-10-12 00:12:43 Honest is the short and easiest way to make a successful! My stocks information is just a general predictions never to be used as typical guideline for buy/sell any stock! I do my own chart analysis but there is zero guarantee! And it always a possible not a assuredly!
6164 2018-10-12 00:12:23 True, while stocks in the foreign countries are plumeting.
6165 2018-10-12 00:12:06 Hopped in $HMY due to rel vol >1.5 and #gold is increasing. 2 positive indicators. Break and hold of 2.05 is key #stocks
6166 2018-10-12 00:11:55 Yes. I killed it a week or so ago on acbff look them up. I did not want to be greedy so I sold but still made great money. There are going to be an Amazon among weed stocks. I just can’t figure out who is going to end on top.
6167 2018-10-12 00:11:47 A2: Economics class — a stock market game where students must use the knowledge we gain in class to buy/sell stocks in class. Gamify economics.  #MasteryChat

6169 2018-10-12 00:10:11 Folks keep clamoring here about the stock market dip, blaming tariffs, but it is really a lot to do with debt, interest rate increases, mandatory withdraws from the stock market (from 401ks), diminishing EROI, chronic low fertility rates, and the tech stocks/buy-backs bubble.
6170 2018-10-12 00:10:10 i’m on the hunt for out of print skottie young covers. any place that stocks those?
6171 2018-10-12 00:10:08 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
6172 2018-10-12 00:09:45 Exactly, Karen. But the Magaz are too stupid to understand Fox exploits their viewers to put money into the 1%'s pockets. So we'll probably hear the Magaz chanting: "Buy Stocks!"
6173 2018-10-12 00:09:44 Lots of panic in the stocks and crypto today. Remember to stick to your game plans. Take losses/gains as they happe and plan your next moves. Worst thing you can do is hold onto a losing trade.
6174 2018-10-12 00:09:10 She needs to actually play the game to get stocks and her mixup is too full of holes, unsure on B/A because of that really, You actually get to play neutral against her too easily
6175 2018-10-12 00:08:44 Google stocks heat maps and you should have several different type of sites.
6176 2018-10-12 00:08:44 Stocks down trump down.
6177 2018-10-12 00:08:29 Remind your father he hasn't tweeted about the markets for a while & how great things are with him as @Potus.
 Oh Donnie Boy, The Stocks, the Stocks are falling
But we all know, he'll try to blame the Fed
His knowledge of finance is so appalling
He's In Way Deeper Than his Head
6178 2018-10-12 00:08:29 stocks stocks stocks on my fuckin mind
6179 2018-10-12 00:08:12 No stocks?  Not even in your retirement plan?
6180 2018-10-12 00:08:04 You have to wait it out if your stocks are down. There is no other way. They will lose a fortune if they sell on the down.
6181 2018-10-12 00:08:01 Parts of your state don’t have clean water for years now. Flint still has no clean water after years!!! You blew up the deficit and left middle class to pay for it. Jobs closing. Wage gap increasing. Inflation up. Stocks down. Housing costs up. GOP attacked preexisting conditions
6182 2018-10-12 00:07:41 Like the Magaz can afford stocks? That's 35% of the Fox viewership. Magaz so got what they deserve: elitist out of touch extremist blowhards who want the 1% to get rich, along with themselves. Pretty much FU to the Magaz! Who are 2 stupid to understand that! Chant: Buy Stocks!
6183 2018-10-12 00:07:34 The market was doing fine with normalization until JP spouted off being “nowhere near neutral” and would go “past neutral”.  Bonds and stocks both tanked on his apparent ability to see the future. Dumb.
6184 2018-10-12 00:07:11 And please learn about stocks and investments.  It really isn't that hard to open a basic Roth IRA account and start.  Vanguard is soooo helpful, low fees, will answer all questions.  Not affiliated, just very appreciative.
6185 2018-10-12 00:06:23 $acst on watch for that 1.25 break. Relative Vol increasing #stockstowatch #stocks #trading
6186 2018-10-12 00:05:36 @wril2 Odd how so many simply assume that everyone bought stocks at the HOD, just one day prior to the sell off.
6187 2018-10-12 00:05:36 I suspect that Trump collusion with the CCP's princelings to throw stocks. Because the CCP exchanged stocks with Washington politicians and Wall Street companies.
6188 2018-10-12 00:05:16 The market’s been overvalued for a good while, and a correction was due. Mr B and I are long-term investors, though, so in downswings we joke that it’s a good time to buy more stocks at better prices 
6189 2018-10-12 00:05:01 Invest in YOURSELF! Whether it be through school tuition, paying the markets for lessons, hiring tutors, or even buying books. The reward of #FinancialFreedom is worth twice the cost of pursuing it! #beginners #money #family #stocks #motivationalquotes #quoteoftheday #success
6190 2018-10-12 00:04:59 The DOW is an average of thirty companies which makes it a very unreliable source when talking about stocks. Gas is decreasing in price lately which it does every year around this time. Interest rates rise when the economy is good and go low when the economy
6191 2018-10-12 00:04:36 Day 3: In spite of this week's market performance, remember that the annual S&P 500 return over the last 90 years is 9.8%! While times may seem turbulent in the coming months, think of it as some stocks being on sale! Be smart, research, buckle up and #TrustTheProcess
6192 2018-10-12 00:03:38 Thank you for supporting my doll Recently I have received a lot of dm about whether I will make the dolls again or not. I am sorry to tell you that I don't have a plan to reproduce it and I don't have any stocks. However, there is something coming~ Thanks for your supports
6193 2018-10-12 00:02:59 An amusing interaction, but I wish somebody would point out that trying to ban bump stocks or large magazines is not the same thing as "demonizing guns."
6194 2018-10-12 00:01:55 Yea not good to invest in stocks to much of a gamble
6195 2018-10-12 00:01:34 The super fan @drewontarget picked this one up for me, but you can get it online and I think @PalmettoArmory stocks it as well.
6196 2018-10-12 00:00:52 my stocks are down today, from what i’ve heard
6197 2018-10-12 00:00:45 I am using Profitly now and plan on using Stocks to trade Platform when I start Live Trading! I feel like I’m on the right path though and have come along way since the beginning of Summer! Couldnt do this w/o @timothysykes and Mike your tips have helped me huge too! Thank u
6198 2018-10-12 00:00:21 I agree new gun laws. No automatics, semi automatics, bump stocks, hand guns, tougher background check. No child should be afraid to get killed in their school. Ever!
