3 2018-06-03 23:59:37 I smell like gas & oil & dirty head to toe, but I actually feel accomplished & happy.

Days since I last felt accomplished and happy: 53 days.

6 2018-06-03 23:59:24 I'm referring to the oil being pulled from the ground. If the bacteria thing works and doesn't pollute our Earth, then I support it. Let's be realistic.
7 2018-06-03 23:59:22 Just put a few drops of Lavender oil in my diffuser and my room smells delightful 
8 2018-06-03 23:59:09 The issue is the weakness in emerging market currencies.. do indeed, oil priced in Brazilian reals or Indian rupee has spiked.. but that’s more of a currency issue which the article ignores despite mentioning these 2 countries hit with higher fuel prices
9 2018-06-03 23:59:04 The rise has been relatively recent with a view that when oil hit $50 that it could as easily return to $20 as rise to $70. The OPEC plus Russia production cuts that started in 2017 have only now reduced glut and in part achieved due to Vz et al outages. Now is the time for M&A

13 2018-06-03 23:58:19 I was surprised that one of the hardest things to find is a good Keto mayo, so I experimented with making my own using olive oil.   Much better than supermarket stuff with soybean oil.
14 2018-06-03 23:58:18 He, Redd and others worked in F-Bombs the way the great masters worked in oil, and we all laughed.
15 2018-06-03 23:58:17 Clove oil is amazing for tooth pain. If not that, two Advil and two Tylenol.

40 2018-06-03 23:57:16 I'm taking a wild guess that Google is trying to zoom in on products that they'll eventually take down channels like InfoWars over, the conspiracy theory channels, which often rely heavily on revenue from "snake oil" sales.
41 2018-06-03 23:57:14 Ya okay ko catrice loose powder.  Biasa aku pakai simply siti pny loose powder or two way cake dia w/ argan oil tu. Mmg terbaik.  5

43 2018-06-03 23:57:09 Migraines are brutal. If you have peppermint essential oil, put some on temples and back of neck...that could help with the above suggestions by others.

Check it out.
I used to teach history.
Should have stuck to snake oil.
Didn't find it did you?
Hes' still looking for it!
Ain't there!!!
Ha. Ha.
45 2018-06-03 23:56:56 Low oil prices for a lengthy period would also be damaging to high cost bitumen extraction. How long would producers in Alberta be willing to weather that kind of downturn. IOC's have exited some of their expensive projects already.

46 2018-06-03 23:56:48 find u someone that loves u like finn loves baby oil
47 2018-06-03 23:56:46 If Raw tomorrow night isn’t just three hours of @FinnBalor coving himself with baby oil I’m cancelling my @WWENetwork subscription.
48 2018-06-03 23:56:42 Child support, oil change, wheel bearing, registration renewal, car insurance ... good bye most of my pay ... fuckers
49 2018-06-03 23:56:37 If he would embrace the coconut oil maybe he could achieve the high level of ketosis that is necessary for proper baseball playing shape.
50 2018-06-03 23:56:05 Joey Ryan called, he said he wants his baby oil back
51 2018-06-03 23:55:50 Baca tentang per-oil-an, Eucalyptus ternyata memang memberi efek calming. Pantesan koala bobok terus .
52 2018-06-03 23:55:47 Used a different hair oil than I usually do and now feel like a grease trap 
53 2018-06-03 23:55:42 Get your oil changed!! Or find the right oil and add some until you can
54 2018-06-03 23:55:31 The flag off of the Oil tankers.. another #Graftshit in the making.. now you know..don't thank me
55 2018-06-03 23:55:28 Yeah, I just googled it. Might try it. Peppermint oil is, unfortunately, according to ASPCA, toxic to dogs. But I found a page that says that vinegar is anti-ant and so is lemon juice. So maybe peppermint on the countertops and vinegar around the dogs bowls
56 2018-06-03 23:55:23 Why deal with Pfizer? CBD oil will destroy them soon.
57 2018-06-03 23:55:12 It's fair to point out that oil prices haven't been spiking. That said, this piece makes an argument for how to view further price increases, which I found compelling.
58 2018-06-03 23:55:06 Wow sis ily and honestly don’t even have one I’m breaking out like crazy rn JAKSJJAJA BUTTTTTT tea tree oil is a life saverrrrrrrrrrrr ;))))
59 2018-06-03 23:55:05 goodluck girl! cuba pakai oil cleanser simple or bio essence it works wonder on my skin

61 2018-06-03 23:54:57 It happens in every bust. When a lot of us came back in the 80s after the 1st volcanic bust and recession, it was to contract work. No health plan. No free parking pass. No job security. No guaranteed hours. No perks, period. The oil industry gets leaner and meaner in each bust.

64 2018-06-03 23:54:31 3. Majority of oil marketers sponsor the campaign of many politicians and some are even in govt offices so don’t expect uninterrupted power supply soon .
65 2018-06-03 23:54:23 They used to give us CLP when we deployed. That oily ass shit used to attract sand like a mug. I tried using Chapstick and lemme tell ya. Shit didn't stick like oil did. And the shit is smooth as hell and works as a natural lubricant. Allows the weapon to remain quiet as shit
66 2018-06-03 23:54:22 Lol I see miles of train all oil tankers with one grain car on it and you call that moving grain lol
67 2018-06-03 23:54:20 I have a nice selection of face masks so at least I can go through the motions of some kind of self care while I’m feeling so down. This one has sweet almond oil and it smells so good I want to lick it off my face.
68 2018-06-03 23:54:16 There’s versions of The Golem that go exactly in that direction... and (a stretch) isn’t that how oil is treated in There Will Be Blood?
69 2018-06-03 23:54:14 Americans are stupid. Politicians are full of hypocrisy and theres a moron as president. What do you expect. You wont overthrow your own government because of blind patriotism but you'll happily overthrow over governance for oil and money. Absolute hypocrisy and stupid.
70 2018-06-03 23:54:11 Trump could rape a baby while committing murder on 5th Avenue and simultaneously collecting a bathtub of Russian oil money. Republicans and evangelicals would blame the deep state.
71 2018-06-03 23:54:08 Girl, I know the "courting while cooking" thing.  Yep, a lot of chefs use different oils for different foods, etc. I went to a F&W demo where Tyler Florence pan seared quail...and I can't remember what type of oil.

74 2018-06-03 23:53:08 Every day I oil my baby, lotion him, and then baby powder he smell so good lol
75 2018-06-03 23:52:53 Oh yeah? What's the next gem, the one about climate change causing volcanoes or the one about how global oil consumption is going down?
76 2018-06-03 23:52:46 I bought the E85 solely to hijack the HOV lane. That garbage ruins your car.
77 2018-06-03 23:52:35 • Shave, then use an olive oil/sugar scrub, shave again... It will get off dead skin you didn't realize was even there. I have tried it, this actually works!!! Hope you guys enjoy this shaving hack
78 2018-06-03 23:52:33 2. Who do you think those generators are been produced for?? Africans and we import refined oil from the United States,common sense will tell you that once we don’t need petroleum products that the barrels imported will go down meaning some country revenue also goes down.
79 2018-06-03 23:52:27 One week post hot oil all over hand incident and my hand is finally starting to feel like it’s not on fire whenever I move! 
80 2018-06-03 23:52:25 Well I can see you are feeling very defensive now, I never insinuated you were stupid just curious why any West Texan would vote against their own interest if they lived around where oil and gas was produced. Maybe your not a lifelong Texan 
81 2018-06-03 23:52:25 Many more Americans are employed working on new energy technology already than in coal and oil. Too late.
82 2018-06-03 23:52:23 Slightly off-topic, but weren't we more self-sufficient in oil, gas and coal in the 70s - or early to mid-80s? Now we are a net importer, and a lot comes from Norway, EU countries and Russia (slightly risky). How are those trade deals coming along?
83 2018-06-03 23:52:11 baby oil, sold for adults, call it OVER because, Mr. Balor says in the tv spot, "It goes over everyone"
84 2018-06-03 23:52:09 How much body oil do you go through during a tour??
85 2018-06-03 23:52:07 HOW ARE YOU GONNA TEASE US AND THEN NOT PUT BABY OIL???? HOW DARE YOU!!!!

87 2018-06-03 23:51:55 Especially if you take fish oil at the start and end of each eating window (or a vegan equivalent of EPA & DHA) and if you try to get 40-50% of your cals in during your first meal.


88 2018-06-03 23:51:48 1.The issue of power in Nigeria can be traced to the oil marketers, what do you think will happen to the demand of petroleum products if NIGERIA has 24hrs uninterrupted power supply? The demand will fall and the sales will reduce so they won’t allow such to happen.
89 2018-06-03 23:51:42 This article truthfully recounts the career of a failed academic and admitted liar and fraud who makes millions of dollars selling lies to people who never got the fancy Ivy League education he did, about periods of American history that he never lived. All he sells is snake oil.

91 2018-06-03 23:51:41 @nestsupport I ordered the Nest lock oil rubbed 3 days ago. The site said it ships in 11 days, but the confirmation is saying 5-6 weeks. I tried emailing you immediately after it happeneed with no response. What can be done here to expedite?
92 2018-06-03 23:51:36 if you have like a cookie sheet (i usually put tinfoil over it so the oil cleans up easier)

preheat to 325-350F, put the fries in for about 10 min
93 2018-06-03 23:51:16 Are you delusional? Obama damn near killed not only the Coal mines, but the Oil fields & all power plant jobs. Which just incase you live under a rock all combined is over 5 million jobs nearly lost. He also PUSHED Car companies OUT of America costing 56k jobs. Welfare is NOT job
94 2018-06-03 23:51:10 Cooking done. Face mask on. Hot oil treatment in process. Only thing that would make this better is if he was eating me out rn

96 2018-06-03 23:50:50 Funny how oil has been dropping last couple weeks, but summer is here so gas goes up anyway. Such a racket
97 2018-06-03 23:50:40 I don't like the idea that I actually exist. People could see me doing something dumb and be like "This girl knocked down a bottle of olive oil and it got all over the grocery store. I'm talking olive oil everywhere. The floor, her hands, her shoes, olive oil just everywhere."
98 2018-06-03 23:50:38 Don't you dare go out to buy more baby oil
99 2018-06-03 23:50:33 I regularly wake after 5-6 hours feeling more tired than before I went to sleep.  Crazily, despite the government planning to legalize recreational pot, I can't get cbd oil in Canada.  Anyone try making it?

105 2018-06-03 23:49:46 I’m not sure why @FinnBalor is all about baby oil now, but I approve.

131 2018-06-03 23:47:16 I didn't realize the movie Deepwater Horizon was about the BP oil spill. And I didn't realize the disaster on the rig and that 11 people died. I only always heard about the oil spill. I'm so glad I watched the movie.

134 2018-06-03 23:47:00 How are renewables risky?  By definition we will never run out of the source of the power, unlike oil and coal which are finite resources.

139 2018-06-03 23:46:40 I'm not sure it's valid to consider social costs. I know Saudi Arabia is dependent on oil revenue... well, for everything. Being the lowest production cost producer by far gives them a fair bit of leeway though
How low for how long does oil have to be for S.A. to implode?  cont'd
140 2018-06-03 23:46:25 Don't M&As in a typical industry happen more at the bottom of the cycle, when oil was below 40? Some offshore drillers did do M&A (Songa, Atwood etc) but not enough.
141 2018-06-03 23:46:17 Diata... what? Where can we find that? And peppermint oil. KK. We think they're coming from an old woodpile near the foundation.... not sure. We can't seem to find the source. They're on the countertops, but not on the floor. Cupboards are clear.... *shrugs*
142 2018-06-03 23:46:15 I had to go buy some coconut oil today these stretch marks are soo ugly and dark
143 2018-06-03 23:46:10 You do you. Just make sure he gets his oil checked first.

147 2018-06-03 23:45:20 When u talk about oil search it's the oil firms that pays most of the bills after they are successful they take it back in number of years. Yes the country may contribute but it's always not more than 10%. News reaching me says we have 7 oil wells at commercial quantity up north

149 2018-06-03 23:45:19 Like any coconut oil? Or is there make up specific ones? :0
150 2018-06-03 23:44:50 Diatamaceous earth and yes, peppermint oil
151 2018-06-03 23:44:24 but they have no problem getting oil/gas to everywhere.
152 2018-06-03 23:44:19 HAHAHAHAH all the baby oil
153 2018-06-03 23:44:04 Finn Balor can keep his bloody baby oil & eyebrow raises because Zelina's here now 
154 2018-06-03 23:44:03 @djtraumahawk Dude, weeeee have ants. Little Black Ants if my Google-fu is still strong. Does peppermint oil help to repell the little fuckers? We can't use sprays because of the dog. We put down some traps, but want to keep them off the counters. Any ideas?
155 2018-06-03 23:43:57 Oil will be 50 more years or longer, get used to it
156 2018-06-03 23:43:56 @jessismiles__ our 1 1/2 year old is the same when her allergies kick in! And was even at his age. Peppermint oil, mixed with eucalyptus, and tea tree oil in a diffuser helped her, along with a humidifier and baby menthol cream (we found an organic one at CVS, brown jar!) 
157 2018-06-03 23:43:42 If only we'd been told before he was elected leader...ah yes, decent political journalists, people who remembered his meetings with his "friends and fellow travellers...oh no - we must be "red Tories" to believe these smears...the man is pure snake oil..
158 2018-06-03 23:43:33 I don’t burn, but I still have to use sunscreen because it just feels better. I feel like laying out in the sun without sunscreen is like....putting some meat on a hot dry pan with no oil.
159 2018-06-03 23:43:29 Our oil is no more ethical than anyone elses. That's just industry virtue signaling while the same industry operates in all the countries they say are unethical.
160 2018-06-03 23:43:17 I made a bomb ass creamy salad dressing today. Evoo, sunflower oil, white wine vinegar, mayo, garlic paste, red pepper flakes, Himalayan salt and ground black pepper. 
161 2018-06-03 23:43:16 those abs need baby oil to really make them pop.

How much is the price of changing the gear oil of rav4 2013??
164 2018-06-03 23:42:58 Try Surplus Supply from Lincoln, NE they have loader valves. One hydraulic outlet box going in and two valves coming out. Be smart and get the o-ring ones, pipe fittings weep oil and in time makes a mess.
165 2018-06-03 23:42:20 bee pollen, activated charcoal, snail mucin, rose water, hydrolized pearl, coconut oil, coffee grounds, which go on my skin and which are to consume, does it matter anymore ha ha HA ha

@CMShehbaz @MaryamNSharif
169 2018-06-03 23:41:51 Needs a little more than an oil change; make sure your life insurance is up to date before you go under there.
170 2018-06-03 23:41:45 I've seen the chart, but I don't get the results (burning, etc) that you've gotten. I do use vegetable oil/grapeseed  when its something that I don't want its flavor (olive oil) to obstruct.
171 2018-06-03 23:41:44 Coconut oil!
172 2018-06-03 23:41:43 Palm oil.
173 2018-06-03 23:41:42 Not just the oil. The whole Iraq was handed to the ayatollas. Syria,Lebanon Bahrain and Yemen are next. Who dictates these policies?

181 2018-06-03 23:40:27 I remember as a kid the stores starting using plastic bags because the enviro nut jobs said paper bags would eventually kill all of the forests and trees. Now it's don't use plastic bags but use paper again. Same will happen w oil and renewables.

185 2018-06-03 23:39:47 It’s the coconut oil, it takes the fight out of you.
186 2018-06-03 23:39:34 I thought Kapler was a new wave, analytics manager. He coconut oil slippin'.
187 2018-06-03 23:39:33 Marinating is ok, but can sometimes be overblown. As far as cooking goes, olive oil, with Kosher or sea salt (never table salt!) and pepper. Sear quickly on both sides on high heat, then turn it down to med low, and baste with a garlic butter sauce until internal temp is 150-160.

190 2018-06-03 23:39:13 Finn Balor has tweeted about baby oil more than he has about pride month. I'm not saying that corporate pride is a joke at best and a cruel commodification at worst. But it absolutely is that.
191 2018-06-03 23:39:00 Moloch whose judgements are algorithmic leg! Moloch whose oil is rotten tweet!
192 2018-06-03 23:38:50 So this justifies the continuing oil price hike by Modi Sarkar!
Can you pls check n advice what was the international crude oil rate then?
Another proof of Modi trying to out perform Congress in all fields in the limited time he has as of now.
Corruption stories not far behind.
193 2018-06-03 23:38:49 I think the ticket fares never went down since the previous oil hike!
194 2018-06-03 23:38:45 Theory: Finn Balor is pushin baby oil as part of his new gimmick and upcoming feud with Velveteen Dream.

Dream will be promoted to the MR after Takeover: Chicago and his first feud will revolve around wanting to bang Balor.
195 2018-06-03 23:38:39 You were missing confirms left and right. Was that a pad issue? Also I see you and Oil King wiping your eyes a lot on stage. Was there some messed up conditions up there? I mean damn it feels like some BS was going on.

I totaled that car 5 years ago.

199 2018-06-03 23:38:17 It was trippy the first time I saw learned that he literally committed to go to war for oil and that he wanted to use Afghanistan to enact vengeance on the Soviet Union for Vietnam

209 2018-06-03 23:36:33 motor oil isnt for drinking
210 2018-06-03 23:36:26 Good one, Sabina!
"The idea that if you engage in enough of this low-value activity, it will somehow add up to something of high value in your career is the same dubious alchemy that forms the core of most snake oil and flimflam in business."

211 2018-06-03 23:36:24 Do you cook the veggies in the oil and then use it for the steak or do you cook the steak first and reuse the oil for the veggies?
212 2018-06-03 23:36:23 my mood 24/7 ?
213 2018-06-03 23:36:18 Peppermint oil be saving my life when I have a migraine in the car

216 2018-06-03 23:35:47 oil painting is very tedious and messy, but there is something v meditative and charming about it.
217 2018-06-03 23:35:23 oil , money and great history, with 3 top empires in the history
218 2018-06-03 23:35:14 Liverpool & spurs have 0 trophies for almost 10 yrs each now. Chelsea is falling apart - their owner is allowed in the UK because apparently he is a jew now. Lol. Utd are a $$$ juggernaut. I cant hate because theyve earned their corn. City have oil money but the club is well run
219 2018-06-03 23:34:35 Trick for rehearing pizza: microwave, then singe the bottom with a frying pan (oil not needed). Melty cheese and crispy crust
220 2018-06-03 23:34:09 The best thing that has worked for me is rubbing euclyptus oil on my forehead. The cooling sensation is so intense that it almost takes away from the migrain. I prefer not taking medications so this works for me

224 2018-06-03 23:33:49 coconut oil works as a good body tanner 
225 2018-06-03 23:33:37 It's cannabis oil without the psycoactive Thc portion. The world anti-doping agency has removed it from the banned substance list. It's used for anti-inflamation and pain relief.  The UfC now allows their athletes to use as well.  It does not create a high.
226 2018-06-03 23:33:29 Are you kidding me? 

I comparing domestic products opposed to shipping them around the planet. The imported products still need to be moved within the continent. 

Look at the advantages of an oil pipeline for example.

Trump gets it. We moving in the right direction.
227 2018-06-03 23:33:06 Why is it that the only part of Bloodsport I find odd or off putting is that JCVD is oiled up, while meditating at a shrine, during a montage. Who oiled him, did he oil himself, and most importantly why is he oiled at all?
228 2018-06-03 23:32:44 You gon put special oil in there 
229 2018-06-03 23:32:44 ??녜??

234 2018-06-03 23:32:16 I find it hard to believe how quick Oil King mastered Falke. Give him a little more time with this unique character, as you say, and he'll make some noise.
235 2018-06-03 23:32:10 I been telling my boss for the past week the truck needs oil and this mf still just doesn't care, fuck it I guess

240 2018-06-03 23:30:13 yeah my skin sucks but at least i know not to use coconut oil on my face
241 2018-06-03 23:30:09 The Trump Administration, EPA Scott Pruitt, especially wants to continue its cozy relationship with the oil industry and increase Americans reliability on oil and gas.
242 2018-06-03 23:29:51 About to fight the firstFar Cry 5 boss & only thing I don't like is that I hit a point where I'd done all story missions except find one rando hostage & a rando oil tanker. Had to run around aimlessly for way too long hoping to stumble upon them. Broke an otherwise fun experience
243 2018-06-03 23:29:46 I need to prepare for Jouvert because my body is due to fry with that oil as usual
244 2018-06-03 23:29:42 @Tesco: ditch palm oil in your own brand products! Over 300 football fields of rainforest are cleared EVERY HOUR for new palm oil plantations – and your continued use of palm oil is contributing. Take responsibility!
245 2018-06-03 23:29:37 Our tariffs will make you pay more for water, oil/gas and electricity. Make you happy how Donny makes America great ? Poor blind sheep.
246 2018-06-03 23:29:15 Jimmy started immigration problems and ME problems that led to 9/11. Bush and his Oil cronies were SA , IRAN , UE and. Dems, Conally and Oscar Wyatt had Iraq. Banks came undone. bHo same thing on steroids + death of HealthCare , terror and #BLACKLIVESMATTER .

265 2018-06-03 23:26:45 Hands ~ refrain from touching your face and wash hands more often
Exfoliate ~ once or twice a week  as this removes any excess dirt and oil from the skin 
Products ~ lemon juice, aloe vera, tea tree oil and witch hazel helps remove oil and dirt and also helps to clear pimples.

269 2018-06-03 23:26:01 You're asking to introduce another point of failure. An X% failure rate becomes a 100% failure rate if it malfunctions at the moment it is needed most.
270 2018-06-03 23:25:30 And your point is.........what
The only reason we still had sanctions on Cuba was because they don't have oil or anything else that will benefit us. The time has come to put all that aside.

294 2018-06-03 23:21:06 Today I went to my dealership for a simple oil change. Walked out needing a filter change, brake fluid change and a new battery. What kind of shit is this 
295 2018-06-03 23:21:02 Fergal and that oil..

301 2018-06-03 23:20:00 You do need some complex carbs here. Brown rice, sweet potatoes, beans, all very inexpensive.

And more olive oil. Even if you're taking a supplement, you can't beat the real thing. Mediterranean diet is best (IMO). Sans wine (if you must).
302 2018-06-03 23:19:54 I recently learned that my liver cancer has recurred and am looking to supplement traditional treatments with CBD oil. But I'm finding the many claims & statements about it truly dizzying. Does anyone have any advice about reputable sources or optimal dosages?

304 2018-06-03 23:19:46 Oil King: the hero that Falke deserves!
305 2018-06-03 23:19:42 One doesn't need a doctor for health care. Often, quite the opposite.

The lessening of the mass consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and hydrogenated oil products would go much further toward caring for millions of health conditions than a decade's worth of medical graduates.

*he then hits a pose*
EXACTLY. OIL. KING.
309 2018-06-03 23:19:08 Thanks for the helpful info. Still don't want more shipping traffic in a sensitive area - whether oil, goods, American, Canadian, etc. I know that's not practical, but I'm not always practical  I spent too much time on the west coast as a child to quietly watch its devastation
310 2018-06-03 23:18:57 Iffa hear
311 2018-06-03 23:18:53 Today I changed the oil in my car and rotated my tires. I feel accomplished af 
312 2018-06-03 23:18:47 Isn’t Russia in crude oil BIGLY?
313 2018-06-03 23:18:31 Seriously! Brussels sprouts roasted with olive oil, salt and pepper? Or balsamic vinegar? Divine! Better yet, with bacon...
314 2018-06-03 23:18:07 Also with Hebron, remember when he let Exxon walk because he wanted 9.9%? The place went up. One year later they crawled back and offered 4.9% ownership. excellent. "The oil will stay in the ground"
315 2018-06-03 23:18:04 3 transportation constraints. Piping lines and trucking can only carry so much. There is always a lag time during peak demands.
4 High crude oil prices which is controlled by the market, again capitalism and by greed that is kept in check by the market place.
316 2018-06-03 23:17:45 I have a bunch of bacon grease I need to use. Can I confit fish in it? Maybe thin that flavor out with coconut oil and use it w Mahi Mahi???
317 2018-06-03 23:17:38 Why does Port Of Van load out more coal than anyplace on the planet and have jet fuel coming in at 2500% more than yrs past? Why not bothered with mills of gals of raw sewage dumped routinely? But worried about transporting oil?
318 2018-06-03 23:17:17 Umm...knew this when I was a kid...If this got pass y’all, then I’ve got some miracle snake oil for sale.

320 2018-06-03 23:16:57 He was there 2 years, not 4. He transferred after 2 years. He rarely mentions his other college. I am sure they are thankful for that. 
And he did NOT graduate the Wharton MBA program. Trump always says Wharton vs UPenn. Just more snake oil.

324 2018-06-03 23:16:37 Pastels because the chalk ones get everywhere on everything and the oil ones because sticky and messy and hard to control

351 2018-06-03 23:13:41 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
352 2018-06-03 23:13:35 I need a good sunscreen but all I use rn is moisturizer and vitamin c oil
353 2018-06-03 23:13:33 Plus high oil prices, plus an aggressive talk radio campaign...
354 2018-06-03 23:13:33 that too... oil for lubrication is one thing, unless we can find something else that works well... but in my mind, the future is solar...
355 2018-06-03 23:13:32 US Congress has opened the Alaskan wildlife refuge to oil drilling. Just saying.

362 2018-06-03 23:13:16 what oil do you use for the egg fried rice, mine never turns out the way I want it to.
363 2018-06-03 23:13:13 Hahahah Baby Oil
364 2018-06-03 23:13:08 Yes, fwiw, I am also unable to access it for some reason.
365 2018-06-03 23:13:01 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
366 2018-06-03 23:13:01 Why leave a negative review for a dirty air bnb? Why out the snake oil salesman? When information is privileged and protected by a small group "in the know" it allows for the masses to be taken advantage of. The market is too slow to correct due to insufficient information
367 2018-06-03 23:13:00 I attempt to make myself dinner & I ended up burning my black bean burger & splashing oil onto my foot

370 2018-06-03 23:12:39 I made a healing salve today from cannabis infused almond oil without decarb to keep THCa, a high CBD infused coconut oil, jojoba oil, a little beeswax and some essential oils. And….

It works on my costochondritis without any psychoactive effects. #CannabisIsMedicine
371 2018-06-03 23:12:31 I am against all subsidies...for corn growers/ethanol producers, oil and gas, raisin/cherry co-ops, and sugar. All of them...but fair trade is not fair. Quit professing it to be.

373 2018-06-03 23:11:28 My IRL brand can be summed up by yesterday when I purchased the hippie free-range eggs that cost $5 and took them home in a reusable tote bag...which I got from attending the Global Oil Expo when I worked for a hydraulic fracking company 
374 2018-06-03 23:11:11 Ugh what an expensive ass weekend. Went to costco, then found out registration was due, needed a smog test, and was like 200 mi from an oil change so might as well do that all at the same time. Bah. who needs money anyhow.

382 2018-06-03 23:09:55 Don’t know much about politics but it baffles me that Venezuela, the country with the largest oil reserves in the world is one of the poorest.

•Baby oil
•Artificial watermelon-flavored candies
•Hotel room bedding (in most cases)
•Candles after they’ve been blown out
•Bath & Body Works’ Moonlight Path
•Onions and garlic TBH? Just not in bad breath h
•GASOLINE TBH??
385 2018-06-03 23:09:43 Coconut oil or almond oil in your shampoo or conditioner should help! Or buy a leave in treatment for your hair and add the oils to that! Only a few drops though to avoid excessive oiliness
386 2018-06-03 23:09:32 Yes, I'll switch between them. But I do like those oil ones! They work nicely for dirty work at the smelters
387 2018-06-03 23:09:32 When I was a kid, the swinger I was fell on my mother's feet. I made some massages with some medical oil, it helped a lot until it was completely cured.

419 2018-06-03 23:04:17 I successfully transplanted mama spider to a bush and also successfully changed my very old motor oil and filter. Gotta take the older car to the body shop tomorrow morning, and then replace the motor mounts on the daily driver. And then back to chapter 2.
420 2018-06-03 23:04:14 Showers and baths add moisture to your skin, but they can also dry it out by removing the skin's natural oils. Hot water washes away oil faster than warm water. So use warm water when you cleanse your face and limit yourself to one short (five minutes) warm shower or bath a day.

424 2018-06-03 23:03:53 Yep. 
Just put them in a flat pan with a bit of olive oil (or regular oil) and water...that way they don't stick together. And store them in frig.
I usually make a double/triple batch and then vacuum seal and freeze them. So I have quick cook ones later.

433 2018-06-03 23:03:07 Yes the primary reason is to get Cdn oil to world markets. Because the cost for not doing so is billions a year because of discounts bc of the US monopoly. This is NOT a secret. Been in the news for years!

445 2018-06-03 23:02:01 Showers and baths add moisture to your skin, but they can also dry it out by removing the skin's natural oils. Hot water washes away oil faster than warm water. So use warm water when you cleanse your face and limit yourself to one short (five minutes) warm shower or bath a day.

471 2018-06-03 22:58:47 Try some CBD oil for your pup. Won’t hurt anything.
472 2018-06-03 22:58:46 Oil was $130/barrel at sanction and the interest rates were low. Ya can see where they were coming from at the time.
473 2018-06-03 22:58:24 From what I heard they tried legal in Georgia CBD oil it didn't work and then the father gave him real weed to smoke and that stopped the seizures, which caused the med "pros" to get police involved..

476 2018-06-03 22:58:14 Take Iran for an ultimate example. We over threw Iran’s legitimate democratic government to reinstall the shah, leading directly to the ayatollah who now control Iran and it’s Wahhabist government. All for better access to oil.
477 2018-06-03 22:58:01 the worst part of being a virgin is everyone gets to point at the olive oil and say "haha it you" and theyre right

would i do it if i wasn’t scared? 
and if the answer is yes, then why even question it? don’t let fear be the one to get in your way, get out there hold onto your faith and do what you need to do

485 2018-06-03 22:57:17 I make my own. Shea butter, coconut oil, arrowroot, baking soda, essential oils. I can’t tell if it works or not.
486 2018-06-03 22:56:50 All this is planned to be in place by 2022. Meanwhile the EOPS is to send out small quantities of oil to potential buyers so that they can sample our oil & price it. This also frees up space in the Ngamia tanks so that more barrels can be drilled & more tests carried out
487 2018-06-03 22:56:38 when mixing a vinaigrette, add an acid (vinegar/citrus), mustard, and an oil in that order. you want it to have a consistency similar to The Three-Time Grammy Award Winning 1999 Summer Hit "Smooth" By Santana Featuring Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty

490 2018-06-03 22:56:17 It's a nonstarter. It wouldn't be wildly adopted unless it's been proven reliable in the real world. People in the real world, especially those utilizing a gun for self defense, would be unwilling to be a beta tester for an unproven tech.

492 2018-06-03 22:56:08 How much is a barrel of oil these days? Lol
493 2018-06-03 22:55:42 Recession. Anchorage has been hit the hardest (just from memory - too lazy right now to find the numbers to be honest). I hate to say it, but given our gov, which seems 100% willing to destroy whatever we have to support the oil and gas industry - I wish I saw better times ahead.
494 2018-06-03 22:55:22 What type of permanent work would be created by this pipeline for BC specifically after it’s built? Are oil tanker sailers Canadian? These are male dominated oil patch jobs. Now how many men and women does BC’s Tourism industry employ? And will be at risk, of an oil spill?
495 2018-06-03 22:55:22 Semuanya tergantung cara make up kamu.

Step pembersihan kalau pakai cleansing oil artinya make up kamu heavy. Kalau biasa aja, fw sama micelar water juga nampol.

511 2018-06-03 22:53:51 Sorry, but you’re wrong yet again rentboy. The majority of UK oil imports come from Norway as well. Try having at least a modicum of a clue so you don’t embarrass yourself with your ignorance again.
512 2018-06-03 22:53:44 so they say but i have fine straight hair and if I didn't wash it everyday it would stick to my scalp and drip oil LOL

Already hungry opposition is getting feed from increasing oil prices.Public dont care about logic
528 2018-06-03 22:50:39 They bet on the price of oil being high like it was at sanction. It was smart thinking using a non renewable resource to pay for a renewable one. We wouldn't have felt it half as bad if oil stayed high..However oil prices crashed.. Newfie luck.

It is like take the fuel out of Hitler's army, but in this case the fuel is the money made on oil by the deep state cartels and the Islamic states that back them.  Understand?

542 2018-06-03 22:48:58 The 7 to 15 billion is the lost opp for selling oil in the US and having to pay rail to get a lot of it there.
It’d be like if Canada decided all BC lumber and mining products should be sold at a discount of 7 to 15 billion per year? Would that affect employment in BC?

545 2018-06-03 22:48:21 My son just left work after having an anxiety-induced seizure. The only thing that helps him is CBD hemp oil. It's legal where he lives, but the VA can't prescribe it (Fed law), he has no other insurance and it's very expensive. He ran out today, thus the anxiety. Makes no sense.

567 2018-06-03 22:46:20 We still import because we have a large refinery capacity. A surplus is no good, when that happens futures fall and the price of crude oil actually drops.

588 2018-06-03 22:43:05 My system is so sensitive, I can't take valerian root, kava kava, passionflower. Forget about CDB oil. The recommended dosage is 20 drops. ONE drop & I'm out.
589 2018-06-03 22:42:57 Oil Shaw, Oli Burke! Ole
590 2018-06-03 22:42:44 What your describing is 7 to 15 Billion $ worth of extra oil tanker traffic through the Burrard Inlet. Once it’s twinned, will 15B be enough for a federal gov’t that asked for a small deficit in 2015 for infrastructure spending and has spent us into debt well beyond that?
591 2018-06-03 22:42:42 This way they can sell any amount of oil at market price through Iraq, and get paid from Baghdad the balance between what they used from kirkuk and what they piped to Iraqi ports.
592 2018-06-03 22:42:29 Asparagus, as long as its grilled with olive oil and kosher salt -- this one isn't even close
593 2018-06-03 22:42:27 Oil, onions (optional), mixed ground beef, tomato sauce with tomato pieces, tomato mark, oregano, and garlic powder or fresh garlic.

598 2018-06-03 22:41:17 There is a product called bio oil. It’s for stretch marks, scars, and blemishes. Helps to lighten them and like... replenish the elasticity.

600 2018-06-03 22:40:41 The oil and coal lobbies are spending millions to spread this kind of thing. To you, it's always about money while the world is falling apart. But - What if you are wrong..... Food for thought.
601 2018-06-03 22:40:38 Get you some mct oil
602 2018-06-03 22:40:21 All of these and also Charlie and musk oil (though not necessarily together).

609 2018-06-03 22:38:57 Why do recipes ask you to pan fry/sear in olive oil.  Are they trying to start a house ?  Learned that from experience in my apartment back in the day.  Use vegetable or grapeseed oil.  Stick to marinades and dressings with the EVOO.
610 2018-06-03 22:38:57 Anointing oil is —take any oil in your home,  pour a little into a container. Pray and ask God to bless the oil, sanctify it, and impart His healing power into it. That is all...Bam! Easy, simple!
611 2018-06-03 22:38:45 Opportunities? The Scotiabank newsletter I tweeted to you earlier estimates an opportunity cost of 7 to 15 billion Canadian economy on an annual basis for not getting a pipeline to tidewater. Cdn oil sold in the US is heavily discounted because we can’t get it to other markets.
612 2018-06-03 22:38:28 Handy cleaner for this. A mix of white vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, a few drops of lavender oil in a spray bottle.  Spray and blot 
613 2018-06-03 22:38:25 They been feasting on me the past two days. This is like my 15th bite. They basically went from legs, to arms, to fingers. It's good thing I have a 16 oz tub of my Shea butter, olive oil, and tea tree oil mix to combat the itch. Annoying but harmless.

616 2018-06-03 22:38:02 You like olive oil.
617 2018-06-03 22:37:54 ok, things @SpringHillTenn doesn't need any more of, banks, pre-schools, more houses, oil and tire changing, and what we need is for local government to quit loly-gagging on widening the roads #roads #Springhill

621 2018-06-03 22:37:25 the oil!
622 2018-06-03 22:37:11 I think I'm allergic to the batter Wendy's uses or the oil maybe, on the chicken strips. They're so good but after I eat them I'm having allergy issues :(
623 2018-06-03 22:37:07 Just... Stay like this. I'll get the olive oil.
624 2018-06-03 22:36:38 Thanks Brent. I’m surprised it’s less than 2% of GDP. Many have referenced it as the Saudi Arabia of U3O8.... but Saudi oil is over 40% of GDP. Perhaps a misguided comparison from a % of GDP standpoint? Interesting.
625 2018-06-03 22:36:24 Ok just saying....McDonalds mocha Frappes are 10 x’s better then any Frappe Starbucks has. Hands down!
626 2018-06-03 22:36:15 At St. Pete GP several years ago, Corvette Pace car blew the engine halfway through the pace lap coming to green - dumped oil all over the track. Didn't do much for the plastic pig badge.
627 2018-06-03 22:36:10 Oh I didn't mean Hook Up. What I meant was do you have or know of someone that does the oil you can use in e-juice.

All the ports on the west coast need to be shut up. Sure you can see oil but it can be cleaned up
 What about a tankard full of coal or fertilizer. Would leak for and are leaking for hundreds of years.

632 2018-06-03 22:35:26 Thank you so much! And girl coconut oil and shea butter is a life saver. Used it my whole pregnancy. Even if you use it a couple times a day now it could reduce the look of them. You just have to stick with it. I didn’t know about it at first so my boobs are bad 
633 2018-06-03 22:35:19 If only they didn't kick sick kids and families out of treatment simply because they were using hemp oil or cannabis though. That broke my heart and shattered my faith and trust in Children's Mercy.
634 2018-06-03 22:35:15 Yes. I have had spider bites that even turned black... Neet lavender oil, lots of it, seemed to help with the itch. It also helped to prevent infection. Right after the bite, any bite, I pour amonia over it to neutralize any acid in the poison. Then I switch to vinegar...
635 2018-06-03 22:35:14 My #SundayFunday: mowed the lawn, changed oil in wife's Jeep, painted a little, and (badly) attempted to fix a/c.

637 2018-06-03 22:34:58 We have a massive resource sector. We are the United States biggest single oil supplier. A lot of our resources remain untapped. The US currently has a buying advantage because the US $ is stronger than the CDN $....

639 2018-06-03 22:34:43 And we are still importing crude oil from UAE.Why not buy the oil from Tullow Oil and save on logistics? Will be cheaper as we envisage cutting the 50k barrels average import of crude oil to zero.We also consume more than we refine at Msa.

641 2018-06-03 22:34:22 The extra money Nalcor is making on oil and gas. Using it for rate stability is DWs point.
642 2018-06-03 22:34:22 man these guys are snake oil salesmen. #alternativefacts #recollectionskeepchanging wtf?
643 2018-06-03 22:34:18 Since facts matter, allow me to correct something.  Gas prices have nothing to do with foreign policy. Oil is up because the supply-demand gap has closed and demand is rising.
644 2018-06-03 22:34:12 When will the Chopped contestants learn to NOT USE TRUFFLE OIL!!!
645 2018-06-03 22:34:07 I am PAIN FREE.. 
You have to try Hemp THC Free CBD oil.
I have Fibro, osteoarthritis, gout, CRPS, BPH bladder disease (can't pee), Gastroparesis, hair was falling out, serve depression, and more.

647 2018-06-03 22:33:58 Franklin Graham is a hypochristian and christofascist. He no more has the love of God in his heart than does any other theocratic fascist. He is a new age Pharisee pandering his snake oil to the idiot masses.
648 2018-06-03 22:33:43 @Tesco ditch the palm oil. No excuse for your ignorance and lack of compassion.
649 2018-06-03 22:33:29 And they won't in Texas. New York and the Eastern Seaboard States, its possible as we supply the grid. Canada has a larger economy than Russia based on GDP, Texas may as well, I don't know. In 1980 the largest holding company was Murchison Oil, Dallas. My cousins are Murchisons.

655 2018-06-03 22:32:46 Exactly!  True communities were built 100 years ago.  Seems like much of the oil & gas is temporary and the workers are living away from their families.
656 2018-06-03 22:32:42 According to your graphic, Looks like Canadian oil is still in the pipes Mikey.  Perhaps our engineers, welders, pipe fitters, NDT techs are just a little bit better. :)
657 2018-06-03 22:32:29 You just pre-heat the deep-fryer to 350 and let the JPEG cook for 7-10 minutes until it's totally unreadable. Canola oil is best for this but vegetable or even peanut work too.
658 2018-06-03 22:31:42 You need to aim higher. Look for the job where you can get somebody else to oil them for you.
659 2018-06-03 22:31:39 Got to start taking castor oil from tomorrow. God give me strength 
660 2018-06-03 22:31:23 ......That could be explained, if it were only about Sanctions. I think it's to do with their abundance of Oil. Think about this: Russia doesn't make or produce anything. They've nothing too use, and or offer the World in Trade, other than Oil.....

666 2018-06-03 22:30:50 Since I can’t smoke without freaking the fuck out I decided to try some CBD oil for my nausea. I went from wanting to puke to perfectly fine on 5 minutes.

668 2018-06-03 22:30:19 Spider bites can be v. poisonous. Too many cooks spoil the broth. Keep it simple. It’s too late for first aid, etc. The tissues have already been affected. Use some annointing oil. Rub it on as you pray, & let God do the rest. ACTIVATE YOUR FAITH, SPEAK THE WORD. I’m praying 4u.
669 2018-06-03 22:29:55 You just cook it for 30 seconds at the end, in oil that’s so hot it’s basically on fire.

672 2018-06-03 22:29:24 Yeah a champoinship team before the Thailand president saved them. And after that billions of £ from the oil pumps and still dont understand that they are just as plastic as the Chelsea fans 
673 2018-06-03 22:29:16 Our organic palm oil is sustainably sourced from South America, @RSPOtweets certified, plus part of a massive reforestation project. We visit where we source & work with our suppliers to leave the earth better.
674 2018-06-03 22:28:55 I would say wear it to Starbucks. But hey save like $3.50 and go over to McDonald’s where I think the coffee tastes better anyways.
675 2018-06-03 22:28:54 Boycotting clean, responsibly produced Canadian oil is the same for the environment as Boycotting responsibly produced palm oil. Somehow they don't see the utter hypocrisy??? So sick of hypocritical, virtue signaling companies.
676 2018-06-03 22:28:51 I remember using cooked beans in some if the earliest recipes I tried. Maybe they were baked? Because last time I accidentally used some cooked, yeah, they disintegrated in the fry oil.
677 2018-06-03 22:28:49 Yr ass needs a baby oil on it

680 2018-06-03 22:28:11 But you’re willing for us to take on this risk... for the sole purpose of selling oil half way around the planet to Asia. What’s in it for you personally, to be here lobbying for it?
681 2018-06-03 22:28:10 Paul Mitchell tea tree oil shampoo works for me! Just can’t use it everyday. I use the dark brown redken one other days and the conditioner always.

684 2018-06-03 22:27:54 Here is your real proper test as the governor of the first oil producing area in Kenya. Rise to the occasion and make your people proud. Kenya and the other governors are watching
685 2018-06-03 22:27:48 Bcz the people in authority want money, not oil cz they already have free public money to import the same. In short, they never think like you do.
686 2018-06-03 22:27:44 We should all do what they did in the days of old.  Repel the invaders with boiling oil thrown from our castle ramparts.
687 2018-06-03 22:27:42 In case you didn't notice, @AndrewScheer only sees a PM in terms of how he can serve private corporations in oil and gas. That is his yardstick.

So he will tweet juvenile memes about it.

Clearly NOT ready for any leadership position.

688 2018-06-03 22:27:33 It’s hilarious! That club was nothing but a mid table blip before the oil money.  Now they have the best team money can buy, and STILL have fans dressed as blue chairs.
689 2018-06-03 22:27:26 Went to a restaurant and ordered a Guinness. The bikers next to me said it was motor oil so I replied that “I am a finely tuned machine that needs oil”. Long story short, we’re friends.

705 2018-06-03 22:24:39 Please tell me that you have stock in baby oil???  They should be paying you to promote it. lol.
706 2018-06-03 22:24:37 Oof honey soap dries you out. Look for a separate face wash (not soap!) that’s moisturizing. I do recommend a lotion, oil free ones are lighter weight. Burt’s bees makes a nice one. Since you’re looking for low effort just a face wash and lotion should do you fine
707 2018-06-03 22:24:20 @checkupcbc Nice that fat cat oil workers and people living elsewhere in country get to treat BC like sacrificial lamb.Jesus was sacrifice.This is dirty oil,dirty politics+I'd rather leave Canada than pay for pipline I'm so against.Hate gun culture foisted on us by right wing.xo
708 2018-06-03 22:24:20 Let’s see which cartel steals oil revenues. If the people of Turkana are now enjoying better roads and a higher standard of living in 2 years then this is a pointless PR exercise
709 2018-06-03 22:24:06 In the 1980 environmental lobbyists painted a grim picture of total deforestation in Germany. Like peak oil, fear of nuclear power and the End of Growth, it was all leftist bs.
710 2018-06-03 22:23:55 And crude oil is still the same, why is gas prices up?!

728 2018-06-03 22:21:09 The oil in Generac pressure washer should be changed after every 20 hours of usage. RT to spread this #MaintenanceTip
729 2018-06-03 22:20:59 What's the problem with that? Don't you know Drumpf's bff Putin will be able to sell off his billions in oil money while the storms increase and the oceans rise. No big deal as long as these two dictators get to ruin the ecology of the entire planet.
730 2018-06-03 22:20:50 pork farmeers should have payed more into trumps campaign they dont count as much as big oil or big steel in trumps book  , EU Canada and mexico play it correct dont punish all america go afther those states that supported him most.
731 2018-06-03 22:20:43 EVENING LADIES AND GENTS! Looks like I'll be enjoying some #Fetish frolics tomorrow so I won't be burning the midnight oil too late. Nothing like being at the mercy of a beautiful lady. #Kink #Femdom #FetishLife #Deviant #Worship
732 2018-06-03 22:20:36 holy confirmation is when u get lathered in more oil basically
733 2018-06-03 22:20:35 I bet he bakes at the weekend...while his wife is out rescuing birds from oil slicks in the sea. She is bound to be lovely, Xabi would never marry a dick head...
734 2018-06-03 22:20:35 Gas station attendants who would pump your gas, fill your tank, wash your windshield, check your oil, and expect no tip when you paid for gas at 30 cents per gallon.
735 2018-06-03 22:20:19 Let’s see where the money paid for that oil ends up
736 2018-06-03 22:19:53 Burning the midnight oil, cramming for my numerical methods. Approximation, interpolation, bisection, ffs.
737 2018-06-03 22:19:31 they cook with peanut oil too
738 2018-06-03 22:19:22 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
739 2018-06-03 22:19:16 Later tonight I might bet to making some Green Olive Oil...or would Veg oil be better? I was thinking about Brownies later tonight.

741 2018-06-03 22:18:39 Why is it so incredibly difficult to find snack food in the United States that doesn't have palm oil and corn syrup? Get your shit together and find another binding agent already.
742 2018-06-03 22:18:38 This may be cold at first. He crawls back onto the bed and settles himself on top your legs. But it will warm up quickly~ He flips the cap of the massage oil open, pouring just a little in his hand and rubbing them together, then he gently starts to massage, starting at the top
743 2018-06-03 22:18:33 Fuck oil companies. That is enough. We deserve a world with clean air. You have been profitable for almost a century. Enough!
744 2018-06-03 22:18:14 I’ve been lagging on my oil change all day  I hate going to get it done. I hate going in to mechanic shops. I have to be all bitchy and rude so they don’t try to upsell me on shit.
745 2018-06-03 22:17:56 Yup - I stir-fry it with some sesame oil.
746 2018-06-03 22:17:40 .@JustinTrudeau lies about being environmentally friendly. When push comes to shove he supports oil robber barons over Indigenous Rights & environmental protection & the integrity of coastal waters/communities. What’s to like?!
747 2018-06-03 22:17:32 This is utopian thinking. 

Senators won't shake tables

Allowances of the senators are best guaranteed by proceeds from oil money. 

Businesses will ask for moratorium. Tax avoidance measures will rise. Some businesses will fail. Senators can't afford 'delayed gratification'

754 2018-06-03 22:16:29 Looks amazing with your signature super hot no oil ass zucchini!
755 2018-06-03 22:16:26 Oh I know exactly what the actual increase will be — West Ridge will go from 1 ship per week to 1 per day. The term “our coast” ignores the five American oil refineries and 439 tankers that serviced them in 2016 (the latest year we have data for)
756 2018-06-03 22:16:14 WOW he's one luck bastard! I get like 21$ a week....gas prices over 3$ heating oil up as well...Id say I'm losing not winning
757 2018-06-03 22:16:06 [food] so I grew up with my dad being absolute garbage at making chicken and so I assumed it'd be tricky to cook

...but turns out you can just get some chicken, add some herbs and oil or butter and cook it at the same time w/ same temps as baking ovenbaking some potato halves
758 2018-06-03 22:16:00 what works on stretch marks??? not bio oil lol
759 2018-06-03 22:15:55 Does bio oil work good for stretch marks y’all I just bought some ?

763 2018-06-03 22:15:21 btw, If the coal town you grew up in is like coal town I grew up in there were houses w/ gardens for those who worked for the pit; youth clubs, outings to the coast each summer, a community hall, sports teams, and working mens' clubs w entertainment.
Oil & gas companies do dick.

765 2018-06-03 22:14:58 “Insinsistent”,eh? Would that be a word invented in the fantasyland occupied by hypocritical green sham leftists that eke out a living pocketing dollars from certain US charities that are intent on landlocking Canadian oil? Or is your spelling just as bad as your “math”?
766 2018-06-03 22:14:51 The Batah took his spear jumped on a white horse threw the spear hit the thing , the thing didn't die but flopped into a hole in the reefs moaning and thrashing . People gathered gave it a golden oil of  healing to try make it stop screaming. 
Next it healed , came out the reefs
767 2018-06-03 22:14:49 Racism is being lit like a gasoline trail to a soaked rag in an oil tanker in a drought ridden cornfield. It’s terrifying.
768 2018-06-03 22:14:43 Ouch! I wound up having to weed whack the entire yard because the grass was so high and after that I could not raise my arm above my shoulder so I'm thinking its subscapularis or deltoid involvement but I'm too busy to any rehab so the CBD oil sounds good if I can get it
769 2018-06-03 22:14:40 he just made the government bail out an oil pipeline the natives living near it opposed
770 2018-06-03 22:14:27 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
771 2018-06-03 22:14:21 Mungwaru, tega tikudzidzise economics. Kune concept inonzi circulation of money. If everyone has an income they will spend especially the youth. That allows money to exchange hands and oil the economy. Reason why Japan give away up to $1000 on some occasions to students. Focus

773 2018-06-03 22:14:16 but we can't get a picture of Earth? looks like oil and water to me.
774 2018-06-03 22:14:04 The possibility is still there, the risk is real and this is all for the purpose of expanding the oil sands for the purpose of selling oil to Asia, something we aren’t really doing now to any extent. There’s no reason for us to be taking this inrvessary risk for money or for Asia
775 2018-06-03 22:13:58 Yes it’s called downgrading services and funneling profits from oil and gas for the next 60 years to hydro to get the rate to the rage of 18 cents.
Rate mitigation my ass
776 2018-06-03 22:13:56 Not scared because you are not scary.  You offered the word scared.  You don’t speak for the left so you don’t get to define the reaction.  You have been and always will be a con man and snake oil salesmen
777 2018-06-03 22:13:55 Oil money, it'll buy you what you want.
778 2018-06-03 22:13:43 Lol they look like they’re going to the club to post and wait for other men to buy them drinks. That look. Twitter world and new gen is kinda diff. It’s a more feminine gen from what I see. World in general. Dudes oil themselves up & pose in pools with button down shirts. Ehh lol
779 2018-06-03 22:13:31 Have you tried lava bean? It applies iridescent and dries clear? And remove with coconut oil? Its good stuff

783 2018-06-03 22:13:08 Yes...the Oil Guy is right: She´s has signed the Contract with Dr. Luke before that all happens.  There is no Proof and no Judgement in the Case, and and as I already wrote: She cant read the Mind of Dr. Luke, she dont know if he´s Guilty or not.
784 2018-06-03 22:12:57 i put on sunscreen before the oil but i know my shoulders & ass bouta get burnt smh
785 2018-06-03 22:12:49 Wealthiest country in the world just about. Just think if we didn’t have 60 million in the UK and had the same population as Norway we could have had all that oil wealth shared amongst a few million people
786 2018-06-03 22:12:46 It is one of the ten commandments that you have to get a neck tattoo if you work in the canadian oil industry

789 2018-06-03 22:12:16 Ecstatic. President Trump doesn’t control gas prices, but I do know this. He has enabled more oil exploration. If a democrat had been elected, they would have forced less exploration, which would have driven prices much higher yet. Still working on healthcare, details to come.
790 2018-06-03 22:12:02 No, but I take other meds, I have a seizure friend who used to use CBD Oil
791 2018-06-03 22:11:43 God bless, reported :)
792 2018-06-03 22:11:27 If you don't support Alberta Oil, then you support oil from Iran, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia. And with it, the dictators it finances to oppress their people.
Oil will be needed far beyond the year 2030. Renewable energy cannot replace oil for at least the next 10-20 years.
793 2018-06-03 22:11:15 Imma laugh cause I guarantee your just smoking a bowl of meth pretending like you never touched the shit lmao. "Dabs" uh huh. The fuck kinda dabs you smoking out that oil burner. Then you take the time out of your day, when your not sucking dick, to come on my page? FoH.
794 2018-06-03 22:10:56 YES, go to the ER. Also, after they send you home...try a paste of crushed benedryl and vit E oil, apply directly over the bite. I use this method for fire ant bites. Don't know if it will help for a spider bite, but maybe...?

(Just be careful on doage, skin absorbs too!)
795 2018-06-03 22:10:51 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that

798 2018-06-03 22:10:41 Pasta with spinach, tomato, chicken, lemon juice, pepper, and olive oil + butter + garlic = a fucking party.
799 2018-06-03 22:10:30 Especially because it’s hot asf and all the oil that’s going to absorb on my forehead lol
800 2018-06-03 22:10:28 Amazon is your bet. Let me know if you find the rose hip oil!
801 2018-06-03 22:10:24 I’m in the middle of making brownies and there’s no vegetable oil

804 2018-06-03 22:10:06 RT @LivingSafely: Big #Mac this June? The first three #ingredients in the Special Sauce are oil, pickles, High Fructose Corn Syrup.
805 2018-06-03 22:10:01 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
806 2018-06-03 22:09:47 U people r dumb. U can’t compare the figures in the right perspective. U forgot the oil prices when comparing the CAD of both periods? It’s not ur fault as intellectualism is a scarce in the ruling dispensation and among its supporters also and their spokesperson. So enjoy .
807 2018-06-03 22:09:47 Right - because our ecomies are the same and there is no difference between exploration and extraction of established reserves.

Hate to put it to you - oil isn’t going away anytime soon.
808 2018-06-03 22:09:36 Oooo yea that's true
809 2018-06-03 22:09:25 Increase will be in Aframax-sized tankers (~750,000 barrels) v. VLCCs (~2,000,000 barrels), which are class utilized to import Alaskan oil to WA State refineries. If switched to VLCCs, number of tankers would actually decrease from KM's Westbridge.
810 2018-06-03 22:09:08 He could care less! There is MONEY in Oil! That is all that matters to him!
811 2018-06-03 22:09:05 OH MY GOD LET ME BREATHE. bannock is scone-LIKE. it has roughly the sane consistency as to what i consider a scone. the only real difference is the amount of oil and cultural significance.
812 2018-06-03 22:09:03 Have you tried RSO oil?
813 2018-06-03 22:09:00 Canada has 15 refineries in 7 provinces producing nearly 2 million barrels per day. Nationalization of oil industries by several countries have allowed them to export their oil at market value. Biggest oil refinery: St John NB. USA has 141 refineries.

820 2018-06-03 22:07:53 Our organic palm oil is sustainably sourced from South America, @RSPOtweets certified, plus part of a massive reforestation project. We visit where we source & work with our suppliers to leave the earth better.
821 2018-06-03 22:07:40 Oil me up Scotty.
822 2018-06-03 22:07:37 .. yeah and history repeats itself. I know shaping policy is a tricky thing to do, but is caring about our planet really asked too much? I mean, you burn oil, you're causing carbon dioxide, it's that simple.
823 2018-06-03 22:07:16 So I got my oil changed at Walmart and now there’s random underwear in my front seat. Ok. Many questions.
824 2018-06-03 22:07:13 The scrub I use is Olehenriksen walnut scrub. Aba I need the rosehip seed oil too.
825 2018-06-03 22:06:58 quart? REALLY? I have couple locations near me first location said 90 minutes so I call next location and they say 60 to 90 minutes. So I go to 2nd one. Instead almost 4 hours!!! Dammmm I'm an uber and Lyft driver so I need more oil changes than most and I know this much (2/3)
826 2018-06-03 22:06:57 @pepboysauto Pretty disappointed with simple oil change. First of all dont understand why an oil change should be $85? Then after reminding him I have discount and saw it for $55. He tells me that only includes 4 quarts. The price would go back up to $85 for one more (1/3)
827 2018-06-03 22:06:52 Oil me up and stuff me like a chicken I’m ready
828 2018-06-03 22:06:44 I beer per 9 to keep the body limber. My friend calls it aiming oil. It’s not that difficult to be responsible about it.
829 2018-06-03 22:06:42 @LauraLoomer oil extraction from coal was used in WW2 I want one in USA. 41% more oil reserve for this country . land ready for plant in Salyersville Kentucky & KY. alone has more oil than IRAN  this could be sold to IRANS customers breaking them .
830 2018-06-03 22:06:39 Just wait every few thousand miles so you can offer her an oil change.
831 2018-06-03 22:06:13 The Oil fucking up another high draft pick? *sigh*. I really should find another team to cheer for
832 2018-06-03 22:06:05 ？？？
833 2018-06-03 22:06:02 Just a question, but why doesn't our country, the US and others stand up to Saudi or Iranian oil?
834 2018-06-03 22:05:57 @MBuhari would rather invest every kobo Nigeria has, in a hoax venture like the oil search in the chad basin than, to investment in a profitable venture like NLNG
835 2018-06-03 22:05:38 Also said, don't ask, don't receive.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.....and all that!
836 2018-06-03 22:05:28 Dor down 12.5% tonight,mcap is less than half of prim and only a fraction more than gun,pity there is no effort to support the SP in Australia,simple fact that income from oil should make SP at least 5 times this price and that is a fact that will not interfere with our JV angus
837 2018-06-03 22:04:59 As if @AndrewScheer wouldn't have done the exact same thing. The fool would probably lick their oil stained boots before and after too.
838 2018-06-03 22:04:55 Lol!   No cop/ Sheriff is going to do this.  We took our oath to COTUS.
839 2018-06-03 22:04:54 Great article... The challenge remains the rapid development and deployment of decarbonized systems and diversifying Canadian segments of the population that depend on the oil and gas sector.
840 2018-06-03 22:04:51 Yep ripping the customers off    Fraud and lazy   That’s what’s happens , a box of quality oil is 30-60 for a 3 gallon box I believe , that’s why the industry sucks because there’s to many cats like him.
841 2018-06-03 22:04:47 Blunt before this oil change 
842 2018-06-03 22:04:18 My god how blind can you be. All Arab nation how great they are are indeed Planet distance from Israel in all fields. If not the Oil they have they would still live in a dessert. Open your eyes and get out of your brainwashed mind and discover the real world
843 2018-06-03 22:04:13 I agree. I was going to comment by saying look into cannabis oil (much more potent than cbd oil) and very effective for overcoming cancer.
844 2018-06-03 22:04:08 Very interesting,  it's definitely something we don't think about. Most of the world is stuck on the consumption of water and oil, but this brings to light the consumption of other resources. Thank you for sharing.
845 2018-06-03 22:04:02 Well you must do it strategically because everyone I’ve seen who highlights their chin looks like an oil slick  your makeup never looks bad
846 2018-06-03 22:03:49 I only get my oil change there since I get a discount or warranty work. Other than that, I do myself lol
847 2018-06-03 22:03:46 Nigga said go side ways over the bumps ... bitch how come u try and make my car over a speed bump without the oil pan getting tko’d by that shit
848 2018-06-03 22:03:45 Whoa wrong!! Same arguments used for Energy East. In fact i asked that to Irving when i was an intervenor against EE theres no plans to stop current oil by rail which is a different product- in fact they want both. Oil by rail to Belledune nb and Energy East

852 2018-06-03 22:03:17 How come it seems that whenever you get a simple oil change your car comes back very slightly worse off than before? Like the gas has a quarter second lag or your air conditioning is oh so noticeable less cool?

860 2018-06-03 22:02:35 Wrong our oil comes from Saudi
861 2018-06-03 22:02:29 ps: In India coal contributes with 56.9% to their energy generation, cutting this by 50% with oil from Canada would cut down their CO2 emissions by how much, has anyone done the calculations? #cdnpoli #bcpoli
862 2018-06-03 22:02:20 No money or oil in it for the US bro
863 2018-06-03 22:02:17 Oh my, I'm so behind the times!!!! Well at least the poor baby isn't getting castor oil, Father's John or cod liver oil. Lol
864 2018-06-03 22:01:58 Ok sis drop the names of the moisturizers and eye cream etc all. Pls me now just use toner, moisturizer and oil. Starting to break out
865 2018-06-03 22:01:54 I was never big on milk. Butter and cheese however.... I've switched over to avocado oil for all cooking needs. Goat cheese, feta and parmesan seem to be ok as a substitute to cheddar and mozza. 

Blend frozen fruit with almond milk and refreeze. Close enough to ice cream!
866 2018-06-03 22:01:46 Ok..you are just ignorant,  full of feelings not based on truth. take a few minutes to think of the whole world..."arab self determination" go talk to the oil rich muslim countries about how You are a victim in the middle east.
867 2018-06-03 22:01:41 My first thought was that you dipped your sushi in nuln oil rather than soy sauce.... that would have been a new paint fail!

869 2018-06-03 22:01:35 Please jump on a plane and go and blockade Saudi oil. Oh that’s right you don’t have the guts. Or perhaps go to Iran and blockade their oil. Again too afraid. You’d rather attack a modern country that had some of the most stringent controls in the world.#convenient1stwrldprotest
870 2018-06-03 22:01:11 Thanks for the warning.  Hahahahaha
871 2018-06-03 22:01:05 'fat oil'
872 2018-06-03 22:01:01 @FreshMenuIndia @FreshMenuCares you IDIOTS, after eating the food that you served, which was visibly stale, I got sore throat and up coughing the whole night. If you can’t serve good food then you had better not serve and cheat people. Not sure what kind of oil you use.

875 2018-06-03 22:00:41 You need maybe a bit more heat in your kitchen to get it to rise better. Make sure the yeast isn't expired, and it has enough sugar to live on. Also a bit of oil helps it from sticking to your hands.
876 2018-06-03 22:00:32 @TerryMcMillen  and the Amalie oil team has been a force to be reckoned with in 2018. Unfortunate round one lose but the track has been tricky in #E1 #Route66Nats #NHRAonFOX

888 2018-06-03 21:59:24 ISRAEL gets,free oil and gas,from SAUDI ARABIA for going along with the  UNITED STATES pulling out of the IRAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS DEAL,
889 2018-06-03 21:59:13 Our organic palm oil is made in South America – where there are no orangutans. We visit where our palm oil is grown & work with suppliers who share our values to leave the earth better. Our palm oil is @RSPOtweets certified and supports massive reforestation projects.
890 2018-06-03 21:58:45 China's electricity that fuels all those electric busses is produced predominantly from coal – 73% in 2015. Replacing let's say 50% of that coal with oil would represent cutting how many millions of tons of CO2 ?? Has anyone made the calculations? Just asking #bcpoli #cdnpoli
891 2018-06-03 21:58:44 Because the EU tells us we are not allowed to produce too much of a lot of things. Farmers have to cull livestock to keep prices higher and crops are held back for the same reason. As for oil, we export nearly as much as we import. Self sufficiency is within our grasp.
892 2018-06-03 21:58:29 Oil=snake oil
893 2018-06-03 21:58:28 Our organic palm oil is made in South America – where there are no orangutans. We visit where our palm oil is grown & work with suppliers who share our values to leave the earth better. Our palm oil is @RSPOtweets certified and supports massive reforestation projects.
894 2018-06-03 21:58:19 May 18th, 60 fund managers with a combined $10.4trn in assets urged the oil and gas industry to be “more transparent and take responsibility for all of its emissions”.
895 2018-06-03 21:58:18 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
896 2018-06-03 21:58:15 GAS has,gone up tremendously because of SAUDI ARABIA ,,it was SAUDI ARABIA and ISRAEL who pushed the,UNITED STATES to abandon the NUCLEAR WEAPONS DEAL this effort will prevent IRAN from selling OIL and,in doing so SAUDI ARABIA gets,to control the world's oil market prices, and,,
897 2018-06-03 21:58:08 Perhaps petroleum prices will get so high that every driver will stsrt looking seriously at electric vehicles. It'd be bad for the oil companies, but great for ecology .

900 2018-06-03 21:58:02 Kombucha looks and tastes like a man from New Jersey filled a mason jar full of runoff from an oil refinery, slapped a 5 dollar price tag on it, and then flew to LA to sell it under a name that may or not sound like the Incan god of prosperity.
901 2018-06-03 21:57:53 That's all you got. LOL You have been Hoodwinked and bamboozled by a snake oil salesmen Donald John Trump.
902 2018-06-03 21:57:51 Also, Trans Mountain would displace Alaskan crude; the Alaskan oil fields are drying up, with production falling yearly. Trans Mountain oil will then head down the expanded Sumas pipeline, feeding Washington state refineries. More likely that tanker traffic overall would fall.
903 2018-06-03 21:57:44 Yeah so back to that diet days with virgin coconut oil (not even once)
904 2018-06-03 21:57:42 Lender as no obligation  to check if you keep up a endowment  your property your responsibility  does your car manufacturer  check to make sure you check the oil in your engine ??
905 2018-06-03 21:57:36 @SecOfState70 save coal. oil extraction from coal plant 41% more oil reserve for USA. the process developed in WW2  this is 500 000 new jobs .land ready in Salyersville KY. in middle of coal mine land , KY. has more oil than IRAN. 600 yr. supply/ we can sell oil to other country
906 2018-06-03 21:57:25 Bruh that Cantu oil will get you RIGHT
907 2018-06-03 21:57:23 Rubbing peanut butter on a stubbed toe acts as a painkiller, due to the oil in the peanuts.
908 2018-06-03 21:57:20 < setting a dot of oil in the center, igniting it a moment later. "It won't burn you. Just don't move your hands too much."
909 2018-06-03 21:57:08 Oil sound in the intro...That's brilliant! Beautiful energy and hands (hands of a healer), beautiful back (back of a dancer?).
I still haven't recovered from the last video (YES, I was watching on the studio cam), it's really special to me for some reason.
A big Thank You 
910 2018-06-03 21:56:44 me: opens a bottle of olive oil and holds it slightly near my face
my brain: slorp
911 2018-06-03 21:56:37 Omg
I put the olive oil bottle next to the water bottle 
Omg
912 2018-06-03 21:56:17 Purging kali ya? Kamu baru pertama kali pakai face oil atau gimana?
913 2018-06-03 21:56:13 my hair is so fucked, coconut oil isn't even fixing it
914 2018-06-03 21:56:07 I legit drench myself in coconut oil

916 2018-06-03 21:55:37 I better be able to smell the layers of scented oil over trash
917 2018-06-03 21:55:36 Thanks, Katie. These evil people need to be rounded up and boiled in oil (slowly).  Trump/Sessions have been catching quite a few of these since Jan 20, 2017! 
918 2018-06-03 21:55:28 I think the healthiest way is to have fresh organic veggies, good cheese, and good olive oil. Oh, and food made with love! That's what makes a meal healthy 
919 2018-06-03 21:55:24 100 years ago Trump would be a third string snake oil salesman — 2016 America puts him in the White House. Amazing ! The WW II Vets gave their lives and blood to free us from leaders like Trump !!
920 2018-06-03 21:55:16 So heartbroken you decided that caping for Wall St, big pharma, big oil, fracking, drilling, pro wars of aggression for profit, pro Jim Crow PIC, pro MIIC, pro education for profit, pro low minimum wage, centrists was the only way to go.
921 2018-06-03 21:54:38 Oil of Ulaz toch?
922 2018-06-03 21:54:30 However, oil could have been replaced by other resources, were it not for the shrewd manipulation by these early "oiligarchs."
923 2018-06-03 21:54:19 No, they voted against a #GOPTaxScam that gives elites like @WarrenBuffett $29 billion more and average Americans just a pittance. Now @realDonaldTrump is increasing oil, gas, insurance, medicinal and food costs that an extra $600 won't cover.
924 2018-06-03 21:54:11 そろそろ暑くなってくる時期だし水分(推奨2L)取りましょう〜
925 2018-06-03 21:54:03 This sounds cool. But are you letting oil refineries work on the banks of the Great Lakes? Are you working to ensure coal factories remain operative near our rivers? If either are the case, then it’s clear your AWIA isn’t anywhere near good enough.
926 2018-06-03 21:53:54 That’s not oil.
It was hot.
927 2018-06-03 21:53:53 Put like half a bottle of olbas oil on a tissue and still cant breathe 
928 2018-06-03 21:53:43 Cannabis oil. It works!
929 2018-06-03 21:53:34 Dude she pestered you for iptv,  you never replied to it, now I'm cool with what you want to say,but yer I have been oil with you,  so I ask you defend yourself then
930 2018-06-03 21:53:19 Less oil
931 2018-06-03 21:53:17 But no jokes, bam’s oil is really good. Didn’t pay attention, checked recently and my okada scar has faded out really fast.
932 2018-06-03 21:52:56 Anyway the.jubilee thieves will eat the money we get from that oil
933 2018-06-03 21:52:47 In Kenya, when oil, gas, gold, rare earth metals, titanium and other minerals are discovered, there are always two types of cartels waiting in the wings - that of officials and former officials of Ministries of Mining and Petroleum and the British dogs of war.

935 2018-06-03 21:52:33 The worlds supply of rose oil comes from the Balkin Mountains. The roses have to be gathered during the darkest hours. The pickers started at 1 in the morning because 40% of the fragrence dissipates in the light of day...Wanda Phillips
936 2018-06-03 21:52:31 Where does Chilliwack First Nation get the Gas? Washington State
Tho Alaska Tankers sailing past  Burnaby sure come in handy for protesters to get cheap US gas!
Remember Alberta’s only Export market for Oil refined to Gas is USA who then sell gas back to Vanc area idiots. WTF 
937 2018-06-03 21:52:06 I guess, I will have to step up the attention to detail with a little welcome home reflexology for you, in a few weeks, Miss.  
Any particular essential oil that you would like me to procure? 
And any preference in a tea served?
Aiming for maximum relaxology here. 
938 2018-06-03 21:52:04 Kurdish oil being exchanged by thugs. Thats what it is
939 2018-06-03 21:51:59 Ethanol has horrible long term storage capability.  Ruins motors that sit for extended periods of time. especially small engines.
940 2018-06-03 21:51:56 You can only spend the money once. Using tax dollars to bail out a US corporation is not as good a use as spending the money on creating long-term sustainable jobs for Canadians. Oil is on the way out, renewable energy is on the way in.
941 2018-06-03 21:51:52 Tea tree oil, aloe Vera, definitely start using a moisturizer with spf to protect from the uv rays,premature aging, & dark spots!!! I use one by Olay everyday!
942 2018-06-03 21:51:48 Am I the only one that spits in the cooking oil to make sure it's hot enough?
943 2018-06-03 21:51:40 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong.
944 2018-06-03 21:51:39 Restaurants that give u oil instead of butter should not be allowed to operate
945 2018-06-03 21:51:38 Disagree about flavor. Grechka is very versatile, I’ve been eating it with butter and salt  but also I’ve successfully mixed it with ground cumin and olive oil and with chili peppers and red curry and olive oil.
946 2018-06-03 21:51:37 Jobs out the wazoo out here in the Permian Basin working the oil fields. If you've got a Class A CDL and a year experience, you can make 70-100k a year out here. But these 106 degree days just need to go away!!
947 2018-06-03 21:51:29 This is great!!!! Everybody gets a job paid for but the oil Barons. 
948 2018-06-03 21:51:28 Should have phoned the police, it’s theft pure and simple! Hope you’re all well otherwise well! X
949 2018-06-03 21:51:19 @Tesco please ditch palm oil from your products!
950 2018-06-03 21:51:19 and i can only hope that the oil price stabilizes during the whole process.low possibility,but for the sake of govt spending,promises to be fulfilled,oil price must be in favor.

952 2018-06-03 21:51:01 I'm not even starting on "UK Oil"  
953 2018-06-03 21:50:48 Americans need to be smarter. Didn't anyone learn to purchase fuel efficient cars from last oil increase? I did. Instead of purchasing another car, I purchased solar panels. I am doing all I can to depend less on oil and coal.
954 2018-06-03 21:50:48 I just love it when I get motor oil all in my hair
955 2018-06-03 21:50:47 Also watch Run from the Cure on YouTube, the oil can work miracles, I’ve seen it first hand.
956 2018-06-03 21:50:46 Baby oil trick to get fake tan off has changed my life 
957 2018-06-03 21:49:54 Please try Rick Simpson cannabis oil. It cured my nephew of stage four glioblastoma brain cancer at 72 hours to live by doctors prognosis. My sister died of colon cancer in 2012 and I wish I knew about it then. Phoenix tears is website,videos on YouTube how to make. Good luck!!
958 2018-06-03 21:49:51 The control big oil and coal seem to have on our government,  the absurd laws Trump is creating to protect a oil and coal while stomping renewable energy at is a concern 

I have many more, would you like a few more or are you satisfied?

965 2018-06-03 21:49:06 By adults, we definitely don't mean just parents. Our parents are lovely  by adults, include snake oil salesmen,  jargon-spouting 'consultants' and a whole host of others wanting something but giving little if anything. It's a very strange business

969 2018-06-03 21:48:39 They didn’t deal in metaphysics, cleanse nonsense, joint cracking, or other snake oil.

973 2018-06-03 21:48:14 Hey @jamespeshaw , the fear is strong about this announcement.
Trolling even on this post is ramping up.
They’ll be at fever pitch by Thursday or so.
Breathe, you can do it.

The whole world is watching; Megan Wood made history with the halt to oil & gas exploration permits.

974 2018-06-03 21:47:57 The metaphor of the double-edged sword is stupid. I don't think the gladiators were like "this side is for separating the heads of my enemies from their bodies and spilling their entrails upon the hot earth, and this other side is for slicing bread to dip in olive oil."
975 2018-06-03 21:47:56 CBD oil first of all, keto diet among other natural cures and treatments for cancer. Praying for your Mom.
976 2018-06-03 21:47:54 You Dems are so screwed up. Trump has no control on price of a gallon of gas. He opened up more land to drilling which should over time make more oil available. Why do you want to blame that on any president unless their policies restrict production like Obama did. Screw allies!
977 2018-06-03 21:47:39 Now imagine if it were oil.... we’d be there tomorrow 
978 2018-06-03 21:47:34 Sprinkle it with garlic salt, red pepper flakes and a drizzle of olive oil. Delicious.
979 2018-06-03 21:47:31 This is a recipe I came up with 5 years ago. It is a medicine/food.

Boil: Turnip, broccoli, boneless skinless chicken. 
Raw: Cucumber, apple, grapes, 

One tbls: Olive oil, sea salt, bio-active chia seeds and flax seeds, lemon.

Dice it all up, stir and enjoy
980 2018-06-03 21:47:08 So we don't have a pipeline to tidewater? 

I could have sworn TransMountain went to the coast. 

And yes Cdn oil is shipped to the US because it's close, meaning its more economical.
981 2018-06-03 21:47:03 For starters we have the TPP don’t sell us Canadians short.. we have valuable resources that are wanted... lumber.. oil.. the main ingredient of steel ( can’t recall what it’s called)
Chin up young grasshopper.. there is light ahead

983 2018-06-03 21:46:47 That is great you found other outlets. Another good one for Autism and Anxiety is Essential Oil Diffusers. I found this new DoTerra Oil diffusing necklaces. THE NECKLACES ARE CHEAP ($12) and you can even use other oils (dont have to use doterra oils as they can be pricy)

985 2018-06-03 21:46:35 I’ve decided that after turning 21 , I’ll be on that hemp oil . No one will tell me shit because it’s definitely needed for this
986 2018-06-03 21:46:28 Only the implementation of policies aimed at curbing consumption of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, thereby averting disruption of the world's #climate patterns, will give the Great Barrier Reef the life-saving reprieve it needs so much.
987 2018-06-03 21:46:20 And do honestly expect London to survive without the water it imports from Scotland ,or the oil and gas. What about Scotland's food produce exported through English ports, all revenue  to Westminster treasury. So who losing out on exports , certainly not Scotland,
988 2018-06-03 21:46:16 Me: I’m not gonna spend money anymore
Also me: spends $100 on gas/an oil change and then spends $37 at Target 
989 2018-06-03 21:46:11 Inc. v. State Oil Co.. (2012) The incorporation doctrine violate the Free Exercise Clause.
990 2018-06-03 21:45:39 Yeah just run your car for an hour down the freeway then go home and pull the oil plug and let it drain on your face. That would be more exiting than than a movie about RBG

995 2018-06-03 21:45:20 you think edibles get you floating? This this will have you in outer space. It's bud, rolled in oil/wax, then  rolled in kief.
996 2018-06-03 21:45:16 Might bring olbas oil back
997 2018-06-03 21:45:14 After all those readings, I learned that I need to change my cleansing oil sbb yg skrg ada mineral oil  Serum will stay as it is sbb helpful  oh yes, moisturizer pun will change to water based. Tu jelah, harap helokla lps tu  

If not, going back to my original routine.
998 2018-06-03 21:45:09 Partying is cool, but? I really rather prefer having my lips moistened, the soles of my feet anointed with frankincense oil, and my consecrated vessel placed in my right hand, when on the precipice of death…
999 2018-06-03 21:45:05 Good point I love it! How do we keep it from deteriorating further? Glove oil?
1000 2018-06-03 21:45:00 Taxpayer funded @CBCToronto running full on aniti KM rhetoric with muslix munching hoopleheads. So lets spend $4.5B to buy it and then have another $1.5B to fight it. Oxymoronic. Caller says world and Cdns would be fine if Canada didn't process oil WTF????
1001 2018-06-03 21:44:59 Surprised @JonathanWNV would step forward to defend a seven fold increase in oil tankers off our coast & 4-10 Billion buyout using tax payers dollars of Kinder Morgan. Not going to serve him well in North Vancouver. @checkupcbc
1002 2018-06-03 21:44:50 "The world will continue to use other oil," says James, calling from Saskatoon. "Why should we be funding Iranian interests when we could be funding Canadian interests?"
1003 2018-06-03 21:44:36 For fibre? Seed? Oil?
1004 2018-06-03 21:44:31 To those driving an Audi A4 2.0T or 1.8:

Whats your oil consumption like? Are you hitting the 1 Litre per 800 KMs? which is basically the fuel tank's range. Did you probably have the problem fixed? I hear one has to replace pistons and rings. — looking for recommendations
1005 2018-06-03 21:44:18 ماتشوف شر والحمدلله على سلامتك
1006 2018-06-03 21:44:13 Nigeria is not a country but a business empire belonging to the British and shell is the major demons behind this, just because the British found oil in Nigeria they turned her to business empire, the British are demons in human's shape...........Shell get ready for more war

1009 2018-06-03 21:44:06 Tak. I rasa sebab i add biored cleansing oil to my routine. Ada cakap maybe kulit tak sesuai dengan mineral oil. So i stop semalam. I thought sebab i sinus or constipated (but maybe one of the factors too). :(
1010 2018-06-03 21:43:57 I use Argan oil hahaha but yeah if the curls aren't comin thru another shower is the go!
1011 2018-06-03 21:43:49 I can make soap from burned wood and oil. I can sew. I can cook and probably be able to build a house from scratch if you don't want it plastered.
1012 2018-06-03 21:43:35 @checkupcbc  This caller is so full of ka-plooey.  There are NOT reports that say our tar oil is easy to clean up.  Especially in sea water.  And yet he talks and talks and talks.
1013 2018-06-03 21:43:15 This being, people’s livelihoods that are based on oil patch work they haven’t even started yet. This is about expanding activity in the oil patch to ship oil to Asia. This has absolutely nothing to do with the current male dominated work in the oil patch.
1014 2018-06-03 21:43:13 #FakeFrenchFriesFacts in the 1950’s fast food companies began experimenting with adding psychoactive mind control drugs into the frying oil. This is how Ronald McDonald, the Burger King, and Wendy pushed their agenda. They knew even vegetarians couldn’t resist their fries....
1015 2018-06-03 21:43:04 You know your getting on in life when you care more for lighting oil candles and having motion air fresheners dotted in every corner of your gaff
1016 2018-06-03 21:43:03 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
1017 2018-06-03 21:42:37 If Nebraska wants their corn, they can keep their corn.
1018 2018-06-03 21:42:35 I went to private school and they didn’t offer shit either. Maybe they should just offer a “basic human functions” class that teaches taxes, cooking, oil changes, farming etc for freshman.
1019 2018-06-03 21:42:24 I’m confused with these pit strategy’s. How were we ahead of Hunter-Reay, then all of a sudden we are 40 seconds behind him.
1020 2018-06-03 21:42:15 Two heads! So much olive oil. So much win
1021 2018-06-03 21:42:11 im considering commissioning an oil painting but I think I'm gonna have to get some folks to pitch in if I go that route
1022 2018-06-03 21:42:10 Oregano oil & powdered vitamin c!
1023 2018-06-03 21:42:08 You can throw it into a body oil for a diy shimmer oil! Or some into your primer/setting spray.
1024 2018-06-03 21:41:57 Juniors. 10 notebooks. Pencil case. Watercolor. Oil pastel. Ballpens. Bond papers. All kinds of pad papers HAHAHHAHA
1025 2018-06-03 21:41:55 North Sea Oil and Gas is in decline; rabbits are being struck down by disease across the country - when was the last time you saw one outside of a hutch? More Unicorns, Endless Cake and Sunlit Uplands fantasy from #Brextremists...

1026 2018-06-03 21:41:49 Is the seal under the cap of a bottle of extra virgin olive oil its hymen?
1027 2018-06-03 21:41:34 Pros & cons I learned @checkupcbc today: Increase in tankers picking up Bitamen oil on BC coast is serious concern & FN communities along pipeline disagree w/th opposition b/c they want pipeline for long term jobs & they negotiated right to supervise pollution risks with the feds
1028 2018-06-03 21:41:25 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1029 2018-06-03 21:41:25 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1030 2018-06-03 21:41:23 Planning to let go (sell) my current skincare (certain je). Cosmoderm vit E, the ordinary and face oil tu. Cleansing oil dah guna more than half   tsk

1032 2018-06-03 21:41:10 But it's cooled, about 15 minutes and season the seasoning oil.
1033 2018-06-03 21:41:04 Hi Rose. Your pizza with pesto and motor oil will be delivered in 26 min via rocket.

1037 2018-06-03 21:40:22 Rail could be made safer with infrastructure upgrades and tighter regulations. I know you can't move as much oil but the point is not to use so much .
1038 2018-06-03 21:40:17 We also have resources, in Libya Gaddafi used revenue from oil to fund such policies. We've Diamonds, Gold & other resources, which the MDC Alliance gov't could use to fund such policies. Our tragedy is that some people where hypnotised by ZanuPF to believe that it's not possible
1039 2018-06-03 21:40:13 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
1040 2018-06-03 21:40:06 50% of our crude oil is imported from Norway. In the customs union.
1041 2018-06-03 21:40:06 lol - walmart before it sold milk, tires, oil changes and drugs.
1042 2018-06-03 21:40:05 Coconut oil helps too but cba for that all the timeee. Showers the go
1043 2018-06-03 21:40:02 He lost his mind during the BP Oil spill and I couldn't watch him after that. It was a Howard Dean moment.
1044 2018-06-03 21:39:59 Say what? Aether = snake oil. Absolutely no emperical, physical proof...
1045 2018-06-03 21:39:55 Cuban officials have raised the death toll from Subtropical Storm Alberto to seven - In addition to damage caused in the agricultural sector, they said, Alberto triggered some 100 mudslides in Havana & brought an estimated $1 Million in losses after an oil refinery collapsed
1046 2018-06-03 21:39:36 
1047 2018-06-03 21:39:34 I've done 1 A3 painting, 1 coloured pencil drawing, 2 A3 oil pastel drawings, and 2 A4 oil pastel drawings.
1048 2018-06-03 21:39:32 i’m sure being rich is nice but honestly it’s my dream just to be able to afford a car that doesn’t require a quart of oil every other damn day
1049 2018-06-03 21:39:27 Tbvh, kulit muka lately ni ada je masalah. Jerawat pasir + biji biji naik mendadak, and ya tuhan, the excessive oil at my t-zone 
1050 2018-06-03 21:39:21 for real: when El Trumpo cries about #CNN being unfair, a sad wolf wants to become politician
1051 2018-06-03 21:38:50 Today is Oil's birthday, it's a Sunday not a Weakday
1052 2018-06-03 21:38:36 No one is saying we will stop using oil overnight. We are saying stop expansion and plan for a just transition.
1053 2018-06-03 21:38:16 Sorry, he called himself a racist with his actions and nasty tongue...All People are not on the Illegitimate President's falsehood propaganda movement wagon. Over 65% of the American people will never buy the snake oil he is selling. So don't be angry at the non-believers..
1054 2018-06-03 21:38:07 Oh, honey. That's not olive oil. They say it is, but when the price is that low, you are getting corrupted oil with who knows what.
1055 2018-06-03 21:38:01 Yes coconut oil.
1056 2018-06-03 21:37:57 Grid will not support transportation as it moves from oil to EV. So electricity generation will need to change.
1057 2018-06-03 21:37:40 Entahlah, tp lately ada problem la. Excessive oil and jerawat pasir, biji2  stress . . . Tu yg mcm tpikir cari brand lin yg suits my skin better.
1058 2018-06-03 21:37:39 250g flour. 15ml warm water. 5ml olive oil. Pinch of salt. Mix into dough. Roll out into rough circle. Put onto frying pan. While frying add sauce, toppings, and cheese. Put under grill. Cheap. Quick. Delicious.
1059 2018-06-03 21:37:31 Free cigarettes!!!  That’s what happens when you start producing for the world and dump it in other countries. Other countries keep their environment clean by doing so (same as oil).
1060 2018-06-03 21:37:25 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts grape seed oil with 1 part white wine vinegar and 1 part tahini. Add parsley and jam to taste.
1061 2018-06-03 21:37:19 Love coconut oil - best make up remover ever.
1062 2018-06-03 21:37:11 You obviously don't know the history of Donald Trump. He's a modern day snake oil salesman. He cons people for a living, always has, always will. My cat could run as a Republican but he's a cat not a Republican.
1063 2018-06-03 21:37:07 My mom's boyfriend just poured oil all over his steak, and then put butter on it . That is one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen . What the fuck. He just poured straight up cooking oil on it, oh my God he's putting ketchup on it now , I'm gonna throw up please kill me
1064 2018-06-03 21:36:51 2 cans chickpeas
Chopped cilantro
Chopped green onions
Minced garlic
Cayenne
Cumin
Black pepper
Lemon juice
Olive oil

Mix it up.
1065 2018-06-03 21:36:49 I see @LeevyLin in every top 8 this Time!
Rashid still OP or Oil King is amazing? ........
1066 2018-06-03 21:36:49 Except @realDonaldTrump didn't bend over for North Korea. Unlike  Obama who bent over for Iran & Cuba. You're too blinded by politics to see the difference. NK is begging us. Not the other way around
1067 2018-06-03 21:36:48 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.
1068 2018-06-03 21:36:29 Damn. Autocorrect strikes again! Olive Oil!
1069 2018-06-03 21:36:17 Who nicked their oil then?
1070 2018-06-03 21:36:00 So I can confirm that a combination of coconut oil and refreshing antibacterial foaming hand wash makes for an interesting sensation in one's mouth.
1071 2018-06-03 21:35:56 My oil light flashing girl fuk this car
1072 2018-06-03 21:35:36 Norway is NOT going backwards though. Nobody is suggesting complete shutdown of oil and gas. Trudeau's move is definitely a backward one.
1073 2018-06-03 21:35:33 Anti nutrients from grains and legumes are a myth spread by snake oil doctors who usually sell the cure. Most of the world live on whole grains, rices and legumes and they are the region's that don't suffer with obesity and diabetes.
1074 2018-06-03 21:35:30 The conversation keeps missing the point that this pipeline is meant to supply the dirtiest crude oil to be used as fuel! Not for petrochemicals and other useful and necessary (for now) products. If we must use the tar sands, use them wisely. But using them for fuel is the worst!
1075 2018-06-03 21:35:26 Israel took it like it took Jerusalem...Israel nationalized oil pipeline once part-owned by Iran, says chairman
1076 2018-06-03 21:35:25 So #janesanders where have u been hiding out at haven't seen u 4 while Did charges get dropped r reduced curious Well I see u back  w snake oil poison we not buying thanks anyhow .

1077 2018-06-03 21:35:11 Amazing how incompetent most service is at dealerships these days. Peterbilt Calgary had one of our trucks for 2 weeks, we said something wrong in exhaust, they said nothing wrong, stranded, motor going thru oil when exhaust brake is used.

1080 2018-06-03 21:35:04 A brightening facial mask, sparkling white, with crystals, peacock oil, and exfoliating pumice. It smells invitingly lemony.
1081 2018-06-03 21:34:54 the best therapy is watching commercials and criticizing them down to every last frame
 ahem

MAYBE IF YOU DIDN"T SELL SNAKE OIL YOU WOULDN"T NEED SPECIAL PROMOTION YOU DUMB BITCH
1082 2018-06-03 21:34:43 L'Origine du monde ("The Origin of the World") is a picture painted in oil on canvas by the French artist Gustave Courbet in 1866

2nd base: u get a drawer at their place

4th base: facebook official
1084 2018-06-03 21:34:28 It's about focusing on what you eat MOST of. I do love a squeeze of rapeseed oil mayonnaise sometimes 
1085 2018-06-03 21:34:14 كيف اشارك؟
1086 2018-06-03 21:34:11 Apparemment le combo beurre de karité et bi oil est gagnant.
1087 2018-06-03 21:33:56 Exactly. Norway hasn't shut #oilandgas down, it's using the revenue from oil to transition to green economy. I wish the enviro groups here could grasp that concept
1088 2018-06-03 21:33:48 The world has access to oil produced in Canada through the existing TransMountain pipeline. It ships to the US at the same price.

There is no magical tidewater price for the products. If there was, they would be getting it already.
1089 2018-06-03 21:33:48 Oil... Heated at high temperature... Bursting open...
1090 2018-06-03 21:33:44 Tea tree oil
1091 2018-06-03 21:33:43 French fries aren't actually made out of potatoes. During the frying process, the potato is sublimated and what remains, (The french fry,) is actually just solidified oil. #fakefrenchfriesfacts
1092 2018-06-03 21:33:27 Most irresponsible workers w/ money in order from least to most:
Oil Rig

1093 2018-06-03 21:33:18 body shop’s tea tree oil sucks idk why i keep buying them tbh
1094 2018-06-03 21:33:12 Shut Up Meg....
1095 2018-06-03 21:33:05 Exactly ! I did that yesterday and i had a oil pen but that shit not like a blunt ... i just need me a nice blunt break once n awhile 
1096 2018-06-03 21:32:55 Coconut oil is not expensive. And it tastes good too. Just sayin.
1097 2018-06-03 21:32:55 you can use coconut oil for an unsettling amount of things
1098 2018-06-03 21:32:53 labor me please I’m fenna drink a whole bottle of castor oil & have some rough sex an walk it off 
1099 2018-06-03 21:32:51 It’s a 2way street, that’s why there is pressure on both sides. In the case of petroleum products there are many other non eu countries who could easily step in with little or no notice with the refined product. Oil refining is a dyeing trade not only in the UK but also the EU
1100 2018-06-03 21:32:50 Assalamualaikum kak iman, cleansing gel ni sama function dengan cleansing oil ke boleh guna untuk double cleansing? Ke dia macam cleanser biasa je? Contoh yg innisfree bija trouble cleansing gel
1101 2018-06-03 21:32:42 Want pentagrin or any other youuber to see this and then see shut out of context and then say shit about you and others. I mean it’s good that your trying to find out about if this girl or guy is a pedo, but don’t dig to deep and miss your ‘oil’ entirely (oil as in proof)
1102 2018-06-03 21:32:28 Solar can be decentralized and won't require a grid. Zoom out. Also renewable is renewable by definition. Oil is going to run out at some point. Not going to argue when. But at some point need to pivot. Why not now while we have some oil as a runway?
1103 2018-06-03 21:32:23 He filled up my gas tank and advised that I get an oil change in the next 350 miles.
1104 2018-06-03 21:32:17 That was in spite of Harper not bc of him. If U look at all latest Economic reports, unemployment is at lowest level in 40 years. Harper took a $13.8B surplus & turned it into $18B deficit. He added $160B to our National Debt, left Infrastructure crumbling & Econ depend on Oil.
1105 2018-06-03 21:32:16 I could literally smell the castor oil RN
1106 2018-06-03 21:31:58 Trump is making us energy independent, unlike Obama, Hillary and the Dems who wanted to keep us dependent on foreign oil. So the price of gas "down the road" will DROP because of this. Nice political deception Chuckie.
1107 2018-06-03 21:31:56 One of the funniest shit this Buhari did was telling Nigerians he wanted to diversify the economic and not rely only on crude oil only for him to waste shit load of money on several tests in the north looking for crude oil...
1108 2018-06-03 21:31:53 Most sensible Nigerians know that only states where oil is back up shortly.
1109 2018-06-03 21:31:49 You know it’s too hot in your room when your coconut oil for your skin, which is normally solid in a jar, has turned to liquid
1110 2018-06-03 21:31:49 Definitely not my Argan oil !
1111 2018-06-03 21:31:05 Ohhhh, just LOVE that smell! I even have a bottle of Bog Myrtle essential oil for those moments that I need to be transported to Sutherland Lovely shots as usual, Hazel.
1112 2018-06-03 21:30:53 おはようございます！今日も一日おいしいご飯を食べられるようお手伝いさせてね
1113 2018-06-03 21:30:28 That's just it, The pipeline is for existing oil. Alberta put a cap on expansion already. So maybe cut #alberta some slack. Right now the Americans have us over a barrel (NPI), they're the only way for us to export so we only get 75 - 80% of world price
1114 2018-06-03 21:30:17 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
1115 2018-06-03 21:30:12 Tell me about the castor oil yeh let ya girl know
1116 2018-06-03 21:30:12 It’s more like peanut butter. You really have no idea how your life would change without the oil sands. Educate yourself instead of being a radical
1117 2018-06-03 21:30:11 Please sell us your Nucs. before break up, as we supply you oil in return?
1118 2018-06-03 21:30:02 coconut oil is so underrated it’s literally good for your entire body
1119 2018-06-03 21:30:00 Typical....let's keep playing a guy that's 6-47 with 30 ks...oh yeah Dylan...you're gonna have to go get more coconut oil. #TanYourNuts
1120 2018-06-03 21:29:39 And to be quite honest, that is the same tweets we saw from you with Freeze.  The difference is I knew Freeze was a snake oil salesman but Matt Luke is really a good guy!
1121 2018-06-03 21:29:29 Aiken tree tea oil its quite ok lah for my face.
1122 2018-06-03 21:29:27 Coconut oil is not for your face, sis. Stop clogging up your pores cos your favorite youtube/instagram "skincare expert" asked you to...
1123 2018-06-03 21:29:24 They are also my favorite vegetable. Especially roasted with olive oil, salt and lemon pepper! Yum. ;)
1124 2018-06-03 21:29:17 No, it's me.  We can have cheese on toast brushed with garlic  and  some olive oil and basil sprinkled on top.  save the tenner and buy some gin for after.
1125 2018-06-03 21:29:07 Have you noticed ON debt? PQ paid down theirs with the highest equalization pmts in all of Canada.... There is a favouritism and vote buying going on! Notice PM speeches in PQ are different to ROC.... PQ has oil pipeline but AB can not have theirs? Couillard came out agiainst AB!
1126 2018-06-03 21:28:51 When ever I think of med school, I just think of a school filled with greasy Sicilians and a strong scent of olive oil.
1127 2018-06-03 21:28:39 Some of yall are outchea really putting coconut oil on your face... Wild.
1128 2018-06-03 21:28:38 Geez, I sure do love me some racial slurs from my religious and moral leaders!

Keep selling your delusions and racism, Mr. Huckster. Your brand of snake oil is no longer in fashion.
1129 2018-06-03 21:28:32 DO WE NOT PRODUCE OUR OWN FOOD? DO WE NOT PRODUCE ANY MEDICINES? DO WE NOT HAVE OUR OWN OIL??? WELL I AM HERE TO REVEAL TO YOU ALL!! YES WE DO PRODUCE ALL OF THOSE THINGS. SO OUTSIDE OF THE EU WE CAN UP PRODUCTION AND BE SELF SUFFICIENT. SURPRISING THAT ISN'T IT. WE DON'T NEED EU
1130 2018-06-03 21:28:20 Govt advertises an expensive leaky pipeline as the future of our children / job growth. It's a short sighted plan. Govt also subsidizes the oil and gas industry.
1131 2018-06-03 21:27:51 I don’t have to be super dumb wealthy in this life. I just want enough to have auto pay for all my bills, on time oil changes, weekly grocery and laundry service, and a housekeeper. Dassit
1132 2018-06-03 21:27:35 Also, his eyes are like oil puddles
1133 2018-06-03 21:27:34 Brought my tool box home       Reorganized my tool box  changed my oil  washed my car  vacuumed my car  cut the grass  cleaned the garage 
1134 2018-06-03 21:27:16 Lavender oil sis
1135 2018-06-03 21:27:14 Cleanser, oil cleansing, scrub, toner, serum. Dah. Aku pakai ni ja. So later boleh breakout lah?
1136 2018-06-03 21:27:07 Probably the type of oil used to cook them in
1137 2018-06-03 21:26:25 it’s wayyyy too hot. i walked outside to check my oil and things for my car just to turn around and go back inside.
1138 2018-06-03 21:26:15 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
1139 2018-06-03 21:26:12 #Iraq & Iran have begun exchanging crude oil. Crude from #Kirkuk’s field in N. Iraq is being shipped by truck to Iran, Tehran will use the oil in its refineries & will deliver the same amount of oil to Iraq’s southern ports, #Iran’s SHANA News Agency reported on Sunday : Reuters
1140 2018-06-03 21:25:59 And for someone who is all about having valid arguments, where did snake oil come into play?
1141 2018-06-03 21:25:57 Plants per acre depends on how you’re going to market it: seed, fiber or floral material to make cbd oil. Last year we had 2 weeks of 100 degrees plus and it looked 10 trines better than the corn. Someone in Australia told me they can grow a successful crop on 7 inches of water
1142 2018-06-03 21:25:35 And gas so far up 22%. Trump supporters have short memories. If it’s economic anxiety, why do they vote Republican? Anyway, just bought a hybrid, 
big oil. 
1143 2018-06-03 21:25:29 I was with some makeup in the picture but I wash my face with a soap that is specific for my skin. Coconut oil is awesome too. I drink a LOT of water and I use a black mask sometimes... anyway my skin is terrible, that’s just makeup lol
1144 2018-06-03 21:25:27 It's my grandmother's oil lamp. #aulwan. What's a bong? #aulwan
1145 2018-06-03 21:25:26 Not to mention the fing oil Norway has.
1146 2018-06-03 21:25:22 Do you have a citronella candle to keep them away? Oh and Avon's Skin so Soft dry oil is recommended too x
1147 2018-06-03 21:25:17 Your face like dirty oil .
1148 2018-06-03 21:25:09 I agree we need to transition from oil. We can;t go cold turkey just yet so there will still be a need for some oil. You want to shutter Canadian oil so we have to import?

The #NDP in #Alberta has done some great stuff environmentally & you want to cut the legs out from Notley
1149 2018-06-03 21:25:03 Shehbaz sharif is really a proud son of soil.he burnt midnight oil fr bringing about historical nd practical changes in all walks of life.he evolved our edu,medical,and infrastructural skeleton to its world standard.hats off SS.u r a man yar
1150 2018-06-03 21:25:01 And people's livellihoods are on the line here - oil spills destroy fisherman's lives, rob Indigenous people of their way of life, kill many kinds of animal and plant life.  Yes, we get it AB, you are having a hard time changing, but you must.  all of our lives depend on it
1151 2018-06-03 21:24:57 As an Okie, I am happy about it! I hope other states do likewise. It is a law crafted out of hate and fear. If you add gas and oil to the hate and fear, you'll understand Oklahoma politics.
1152 2018-06-03 21:24:45 Exactly. Those people were so duped by a snake oil salesman.  “Only I can fix it” should have been a wake up call across the board. And now we are ALL trapped by the lunatic at 1600 and the enabling congress that seemingly cares not a whit for this country.
1153 2018-06-03 21:24:42 My neighbours have been fighting since morning, disturbing my peace. One mind is telling me to get a calabash, place three boiled eggs sprinkled with palm oil and place it in front of one neighbour's door. I want the fight to continue.
1154 2018-06-03 21:24:17 I'm about to order some fermented skate liver oil..?   (I wish there was some way I could gauge how far I've come... Lol). 
I love your content Jordan- consciousness, aliens, politics, holistic health, ect.
1155 2018-06-03 21:24:13 I don't know how I could of been more accommodating to mega fans of CBD Oil  I said like 3 times it works for "some" people.  So should I take their anger as they are mad because I denied it to be a a super mega cure-all?
1156 2018-06-03 21:24:12 Saudi Arabia is the world worst country sitting on world largest oil deposits. But it was again created by Invading British forced defeating Otomans. British delibretly joined 3 provinces of Ottoman Empire & handed over the reigns to the dacoits of Riyad -- known fact, in history
1157 2018-06-03 21:24:04 Please, tell us how YOU benefited from Obama’s treasonous tyrannical tenure??
1158 2018-06-03 21:24:01 Do. Get an ERPO on him and laugh.
1159 2018-06-03 21:23:59 Someday I will figure out the magic amount of argan oil I should put in my hair to make it look shiny and health and not permanently wet.
1160 2018-06-03 21:23:55 I just shaved my whole body and put baby oil and my body feels so damn soft. Someone come touch me
1161 2018-06-03 21:23:48 I hear you ... try peppermint oil spray on nest then knock down in morning before it gets too late. I don't like killing them either. You could also try cutting up some jalapeno's and put in water and spray nest.
1162 2018-06-03 21:23:37 Use the Gentle Magic Lotion (toner) and spray the Clicks brand Tissue oil
1163 2018-06-03 21:23:36 Don’t fry it in coconut oil just add a tiny bit after it’s cooked . Jamaican shit
1164 2018-06-03 21:23:35 A small bottle of olive oil here is $7.00....where you shopping, dude???
1165 2018-06-03 21:23:05 @Skinesis Overnight Facial Oil is seriously my favourite skincare product. I’m on my 4th bottle! I salute you Sarah! I need to book in for a facial.x
1166 2018-06-03 21:23:04 He's the first son of one of the richest woman in indonesia. Bangun bisnis di bidang oil & gas since 20 years ago. Kantor nya sederhana, ruko biasa tapi bertahan dari duluk. Kalo dibanding sama competitor yhaa kalah jauuuh ~~
1167 2018-06-03 21:22:51 And don’t forget about the oil under the Clyde
1168 2018-06-03 21:22:42 Peat-based rainforests are one of the most essential tools in the fight against climate change as just one hectare can hold 6,000 tonnes of CO2 (10X more than normal soil!). @Tesco – ditch palm oil from your own brand products!
1169 2018-06-03 21:22:37 I need to take these braids out, do a deep conditioner AND hot oil treatment...and don’t feel like doing any of the above. 
1170 2018-06-03 21:22:30 Oh! Obama’s “no drama” list??!!  Lolololol!!
1171 2018-06-03 21:22:23 Just crispy iceberg lettuce with toms, cucumber, chopped peppers and topped with loads of anchovy fillets .... dress with a mixture of olive oil, balsamic, whole grain mustard and a little honey all blitzed up 
1172 2018-06-03 21:22:20 I'll oil you on the 7th day.
1173 2018-06-03 21:21:55 i'm so tired of this argument.  It has nothing to do with the reality that this is a pipeline EXPANSION,  we still would be using oil.  We are saying no more expansion in this area of energy.  that's it.
1174 2018-06-03 21:21:51 Anyone know what Meetha Attar actually is? As far as I can tell it means "sweet essential oil"
1175 2018-06-03 21:21:39 Amen and AMEN!
1176 2018-06-03 21:21:36 When I was a child we saved bacon grease to cook fried chicken with  but we never saved fish or chicken grease. I don't ever remember vegetable oil  being expensive 1 gallon of cooking oil cost 6.75 at Walmart Come on!
1177 2018-06-03 21:21:32 You know what's really unhealthy? Avoiding fats and carbs. Someone who regularly eats fatty fish, oatmeal, potatoes, olive oil, etc. is a lot healthier than someone who doesn't.
1178 2018-06-03 21:21:25 Kenya, tarihinde ilk kez ham petrol ihraç etmeye başladı. 2012'de İngiliz Şirketi Tullow Oil tarafından 750 milyon varillik petrol keşfedilmişti.
1179 2018-06-03 21:21:15 
1180 2018-06-03 21:21:13 My dude slithered up on an oil spill homie
1181 2018-06-03 21:21:12 @MorninAfterKill apparently youtube is banning people over CBD oil advertisement, so stay safe
1182 2018-06-03 21:21:02 As far as a difference, you can def tell it’s made without oil and butter but they still taste good (if that makes sense). It’s def a much healthier option and I recommend it. Plus you save so much money and your kitchen won’t heat up!!
1183 2018-06-03 21:20:58  Lol fried with Oil ndoda Cabanga 
1184 2018-06-03 21:20:57 Cantu leave in Argan Oil + aloe vera juice then argan oil to seal it in
1185 2018-06-03 21:20:54 the discard is on his eucalyptus oil 
a posterior facial vein out alone
1186 2018-06-03 21:20:47 In fairness many of the people who are criticising the economic case for Independence haven't accounted for secret oil fields, magic money trees, the commodity markets treatment of Unicorn Horns or the Independence Dividend. I'm sure it will all be fine. 
1187 2018-06-03 21:20:36 Cough cough! Seriously???
1188 2018-06-03 21:20:23 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,
--Matthew 6:17
1189 2018-06-03 21:20:22 You need to check of course but I think you will get a safe one easily enough - there are tea tree oil shampoos for sure. I don't like the idea of the systemic ones much if they can be avoided
1190 2018-06-03 21:20:16 Pretty obvious Bryan works for oil industry
If there were less things made from oil products, people would use less things made from oil products. If govts. subsidised non-oil products at same rate they subsidise the oil industry, Canadians wouldn't be forced to use oil products
1191 2018-06-03 21:20:14 Oh no! The liberal presents valid reasons your attempt to dismiss facts about Alberta's recovery (because oil climbed to $70, btw) and you're upset I used adult language. Wah, wah, wah
1192 2018-06-03 21:20:08 Spray them with citrus oil (lemon or lime preferably) and Chili Pepper... or perhaps try playing the Red hot Chili Peppers on your stereo when your out. Maybe that was it?
1193 2018-06-03 21:20:05 Sanot is having a light supper this evening.. a grilled chicken salad with a touch of oil and vinegar 
1194 2018-06-03 21:19:42 I believe it’s Gourmia. I like it because I like fried zucchini and eggplant as snacks, so with this I literally just pop the veggies in with a little seasoning and sometimes bread crumbs and they taste just as good but without the oil or butter.
1195 2018-06-03 21:19:32 Petroleum products are shipped from Rotterdam ( 5 oil refineries ).
1196 2018-06-03 21:19:23 If I can't oil the food can I use a cooking spray?
1197 2018-06-03 21:19:17 Yesterday I got my nephew his first Oil perfume. He was so gassed. I can’t wait to share those moments with my son one day. 
1198 2018-06-03 21:19:13 Cambio é uma variavel super complexa. Na teoria que pode “controlar” o dolar é o FED via expansão ou contração monetária. Mas isso uma inverdade.O dolar tem muita liquidez e funciona como reserva de valor/meio de troca global e conversa com juros Tsy, eur,jpy, ouro, oil e iron.

1200 2018-06-03 21:19:01 You don’t have to be an economist to recognize that Trump’s rising gas prices plus Trump’s rescinding of fuel efficiency standards means higher profits for oil companies, higher costs and pollution for the average American.
1201 2018-06-03 21:18:59 I agree with refineries, but they're very expensive and take a long time to build. One option would be to build a bitumen upgrader that woulds allow us to ship without a diluent and eliminate some of the opposition b/c it would more like traditional oil
1202 2018-06-03 21:18:55 The kid was one of their best D men last year, it has nothing to do with the Old Boys Club. It's called a quality AHL depth signing to help the younger players develop in the minors. Sorry but the name on the back of his jersey is irrelevant.
1203 2018-06-03 21:18:54 Must address underlying issue! Canada has to move to fossil fuel free society and Trudeau Govt must give people the timeline for getting out of tar sands business. Transition oil and gas workers to equally well paying jobs in other industries. This takes time so get on with it!
1204 2018-06-03 21:18:41 Some days I do well, some really horribly, because cookies (oil free at least).
1205 2018-06-03 21:18:34 Praise Like Oil. Sweet Hold Of The Anointing. Blessed Assurance.
1206 2018-06-03 21:18:27 @checkupcbc if Canada stops ALL pollution it will mean next to nothing on the world scale. You need to get the rest of them to change and just not selling them our oil will do nothing.
1207 2018-06-03 21:18:21 New housing here is like Palm oil plantations in SE Asia. Parish Councils are powerless to stop more houses being built.
1208 2018-06-03 21:18:14 Our basement was ripe with it. Spraying all the surfaces with vinegar and tea tree oil and keeping a dehumidifier on in summer killed it. With better insulation, we don't need the dehumidifier as much now.
1209 2018-06-03 21:18:07 I don't agree, research already documented Turkana region as having underground water aquifer enough to serve Kenya as a whole for more than 70 years? Water availability question does not hold. Why aren't we adding value to the crude oil at source to sell at premium! Politics.
1210 2018-06-03 21:17:45 “Buy your gas at the highest elevation possible. Let the oil company pay for that extra potential energy!”
1211 2018-06-03 21:17:43 I had to coat my nose in castor oil and put the ceiling fan on last night so I could breathe properly and get to sleep. Without both those things, the air was hurting my nose and throat.
1212 2018-06-03 21:17:38 I mean oil pulling is apparently a thing but I’d prob go with the shower gel than have a mouthful of warm fat for 10 minutes
1213 2018-06-03 21:17:38 #FakeFrenchFriesFacts
In medieval times, Potatoes and boiling oil were flung from castles onto enemy attackers.  Naturally someone accidentally combined the two, to both defender and attacker’s delight!
1214 2018-06-03 21:17:33 The world crude oil price has risen from about $48 to $79 per barrel in this regime so you should know fuel will go up & so will transport fares 
1215 2018-06-03 21:17:29 Suggesting people cannot speak out if they are currently using any oil products is missing the mark.We must alter our present use of fossil fuels to allow our children to have reasonable future. We cannot wait, and we shouldn't be going backwards. #ClimateChange
1216 2018-06-03 21:17:19 Done with the oil change. Nissan picked a really weird place for the filter that makes me shake my head every time I change it.
1217 2018-06-03 21:17:01 Where is Jesus in your life? You preach words but your walk & your words are not congruent. Leave CA. We do not want hypocritical snake oil salesmen telling us what to do. Perhaps your time is better spent asking for forgiveness for being a false prophet & leading others astray?
1218 2018-06-03 21:16:52 Yup it's from @richsharris book. Touching chilli Brocoli, only I was missing the chilli past so used a hot sauce instead. Garlic, lemon zest, toasted sesame seeds and sesame oil
1219 2018-06-03 21:16:49 tea tree oil, castor oil, and olive oil together
1220 2018-06-03 21:16:49 Personally, I'm not intetested, like my old technology that never fails. Gun makers have worked for hundreds of years to develop reliability.  No twerp or state legislators is going to interfere. Even Dennis the troll.
1221 2018-06-03 21:16:39 Come by Washington sometime, and I will gladly tell you to your face that your an oathbreaker, while I am an OathKeeper.
1222 2018-06-03 21:16:25 Your model 3 will need an oil change. Many Teslas have sent people into concrete walls and stationary objects. Have had their suspensions fail on them. 55,000 Model S and X have a recall on their brakes because of the change of them locking up.
1223 2018-06-03 21:16:21 They say CBD oil works better and ya can keep ur job 
1224 2018-06-03 21:16:12 China 1.3 Billion people,most powerful country in the world,1 BILLION >than USA,have more american $$$ then the USA gov't,they own the USA,desperate for oil,war in 5 yrs, middle east & Asia corridorhttps://wm-so.glb.shawcable.net/service/home/~/?auth=co&loc=en&id=337822&part=2
1225 2018-06-03 21:16:07 @checkupcbc There is unlimited clean free renewable energy in Canada. The govt. should transfer all subsidies from pipelines and oil cos. to renewables at 10%/yr until we reach near-zero-carbon by 2030 as required by the IPCC, the Paris Agreements, and mainstream climate science.
1226 2018-06-03 21:16:06 It's that or coconut oil.
1227 2018-06-03 21:16:00 I swear people need to stop filming themselves driving if their check engine light , service soon, oil changed required, or gas light is on smh
1228 2018-06-03 21:16:00 I have an art display of eleven oil paintings at Fornax Bread Compnay, 27 Corinth St, Roslindale, MA 02131, through June and July of this year.
1229 2018-06-03 21:15:46 As a native Atlantian my only advice to y’all transplants is Lake Lanier is huanted. I hope y’all throwing some holy oil on before y’all go b/c dawg...no cap someone either goes missing or dies there seemingly once per year.
1230 2018-06-03 21:15:29 Aloe Vera gel or tea tree oil, that will help get rid of the infection and blister! X
1231 2018-06-03 21:15:25 Who do you think that you are fooling? Please bring a link to justify your claim that PMB approved 3billion USD for oil search. This is how you start false information and make it look real. You are not a human being.
1232 2018-06-03 21:15:20 The author needs to learn how to read the tax returns of a 501c3.  Failed to account for the income for “program service”.  This is money they get from providing services to its members and others.  No one else is “lost” except for liberals who can’t figure out how we do it.
1233 2018-06-03 21:15:20 I haven’t had oil down in so long & i have some at home & i’m very excited
1234 2018-06-03 21:15:19 I absolutely feel this. 
Was almost overwhelmed by it today.
Even mindfulness skills weren't making a dent.
I tried a tab of cannabis oil under my tongue, and it really calmed me down; helped bring brain chemistry into balance.
1235 2018-06-03 21:15:12 tariffs on lumber imports have increased the price , remember when a tariff goes on all prices rise , not just the imports !!!!  Oil  right now is in a contango  !!!  will drop which will hit the frackers
1236 2018-06-03 21:15:08 .@DonaldJTrumpJr I’m curious do you use straight crisco or olive oil for that slick grease look you so love 
1237 2018-06-03 21:15:08 They are vegan. #FakeFrenchFriesFacts 

Nope. Most of the time they are fried with chicken, fish, and any other animal foods that need to be fried. Same oil. Gross.
1238 2018-06-03 21:15:06 This oil business can only end badly
1239 2018-06-03 21:14:56 @Nopepperdotnet What are the odds the oil in LaMarre's  hair helped him catch up to that gapper?

1244 2018-06-03 21:14:29 But I NEEDED new headphones and I WANTED an oil diffuser.
1245 2018-06-03 21:14:27 All you have got is copycat old technology from North Korea.
Without oil you would have all died of hunger. 
You are realy, truly lame.
1246 2018-06-03 21:14:09 What are they 22LR? Just think of electronics taking any sustained recoil. Hot 9mm loads while not bone crushing might just be too much, especially on Mars.
1247 2018-06-03 21:14:00 I need an oil change and inspection. Are there friend discounts? Pls, Mom??

1251 2018-06-03 21:13:40 Yes I am. I owned one for many years. My Model 3 will never need an oil change, timing belt change. S4 had a stability sensor fail and nearly sent me into a concrete wall on the freeway after it locked up the rt front wheel with no warning.

1254 2018-06-03 21:13:13 Idk why you would have oregano for your essential oil diffuser but now I can’t stop smelling oregano, idk how to feel.... hungry... that’s how I feel

1259 2018-06-03 21:12:29 We usually advise applying cooking oil to your food rather than the grates. Also, if you try to pick something up or flip it, close the lid and wait about another 30 to 60 seconds before you try to move it again and it should come off a bit easier. We hope this helps!
1260 2018-06-03 21:12:22 The only models I've read about are .22 LR. I sneeze with more recoil than that.
1261 2018-06-03 21:12:14 Amanda's got a convoy of oil tankers filled with booze parked up behind the theatre. #BGT #BGTFinal #BritainsGotTalent #BGMT
1262 2018-06-03 21:12:06 Do you know where they are getting the steel from ? Do you know where we get oil from ? If you know the answer to the questions they are using trade to try to control us .
1263 2018-06-03 21:11:52 RIFINE IT FIRST! THEY SAY THEY DONT HAVE THE MAN POWER THEN STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT LOSING JOBS OBVIOUSLY CANADA HAS THE SKILLS MAYBE NOT THE BRAINS WHEN WERE GOING TO SELL THE LAST OF THE CENTURIES OIL ACROSS THE OCEAN AND LEAVE US PAYING 2.00 per litre SAVE OUR OIL!
1264 2018-06-03 21:11:50 Roast veg (sweet potato, carrot, onion, garlic, courgette with some oil and salt) with rice. Easy and healthy :3
1265 2018-06-03 21:11:39 Try cocoa butter as a moisturizer. Ur skin produces more oil to make up for the lack of moisture :)
1266 2018-06-03 21:11:26 So therefore, you can not make an over simplified comparison of oil versus metal extraction as being equal. We should be conserving oil & gas as if it were a precious metal versus blowing it out our tail pipe for a $2 Timmy’s Drive thru coffee.
1267 2018-06-03 21:11:25 @pastorjlawrence took us to school today ... Oil &water do mix.  Stop blocking relationships with people because you didnt get along in the past.  You need an emulsifier (egg) of Jesus & you will be surprised Oil &water makes mayo & on the right sandwich  it will bless you!
1268 2018-06-03 21:11:18 Yeah that's it.

You nailed it.

Now do the world leaders that sat on their fat asses as Putin waltzed in and took Crimea.... and then rewarded him by attending his Olympics, and then sanctioned everything BUT oil and gas to EU.

Go ahead..... we can wait...
1269 2018-06-03 21:11:12 Croud oil 135 dollars par barrel
In India rate 65 rs litter by Congress

Now croud oil 70 dollars par barrel
Rate this time 80 rs litter by BJP
1270 2018-06-03 21:11:06 The sausage and oil are probably the best parts.  You seem to be conflating grains and carbs.  Grains contain carbs but also lots of harmful anti-nutrients.  It doesn't matter whether they are white or brown. The carbs in vegetables however are something quite different.

1272 2018-06-03 21:10:55 Wow. Muslim countries world domination with oil and solar power.
1273 2018-06-03 21:10:55 It could be the cannabis oil...or it could be the 4 years of chemotherapy and the stem cell transplant that caused the remission. Who knows.
1274 2018-06-03 21:10:55 now I have oil in the front and then sun screen in the back :) let’s see how this goes lmaooo
1275 2018-06-03 21:10:41 Absolutely Brett ... way over here in Ontario we welcome pipelines from out west. There all over the place here anyhow lol. Pompous Quebec politicians cutting off easterners in need of oil refineries to ship to Europe.

1281 2018-06-03 21:09:49 Then KO has done his job! It has a teddy bear, a soccer ball, some motor oil, hair gel, and a bag of nuts and bolts.
1282 2018-06-03 21:09:49 Bad for a free market economy. Bad for the environment. Bad in that we should be moving toward renewable resources. Bad that Trump panders to coal n oil producers.
1283 2018-06-03 21:09:32 Do you know where Canada and Mexico getting their steel ? Do you know where we get oil from?
1284 2018-06-03 21:09:24 Scienc has been questioned - that is the nature of Science. It does not need a greedy little lawyer being persuaded by oil/chem/gas/coal executive political contributors to do the questioning.
1285 2018-06-03 21:09:07 Kahan ha bhai oil? 
1286 2018-06-03 21:09:00 "A $14 Greenhouse Chip tonic is concocted from almond milk, cashew milk, peppermint oil, cacao nibs, barley grass, wheat grass, oat grass, maca, eleuthero, astragalus, cordyceps, tocos, cacao butter, coconut oil and lakanto "

Best give me a back rub for that price
1287 2018-06-03 21:08:57 You are asking a lot. Having said that he could be effective . Just not in the top 6. Question is will Oil Brass play him in a 3rd line role?
1288 2018-06-03 21:08:30 Gas.

Not oil.

1294 2018-06-03 21:07:46 America losing its influence there a bit now tho, even Netanyahu saying he wants to do business deals with iran, and if all these countries carry thru with stopping use of dollar to trade oil it certainly wont be able to afford it. EU wants oil/gas from iran
1295 2018-06-03 21:07:45 Look for zero point foods--corn, grilled chicken, bbq veggies and fruit. Estimate the oil they use. And bring snacks in your backpack! (and do a lot of dancing!) :)
1296 2018-06-03 21:06:57 Isn't Leadnow funding you? Sorry you will never get the vote with your anti Israel, oil, military, police party...get back into the shadows where you belong.
1297 2018-06-03 21:06:55 So there is no compromise or transition period? Just shut down #oilandgas? Then how do you run the economy? Import oil.?
So we'll be poor, but we'll feel morally superior b/c at least #Canadians aren't extracting the oil we use? Doesn't sound practical to me

1298 2018-06-03 21:06:49 Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Palestine and Yemen for starters

1300 2018-06-03 21:06:11 You know it and so do your Tory chums. Whether it be Oil over the last 40 years, surplus electricity, whisky and other food and drink exports and even our water are the cash injection the rUK needs. Feck, if successive uk govts could balance the books, we would all be better off.
1301 2018-06-03 21:06:09 Drink the anointing oil, dia fada. Lol
1302 2018-06-03 21:06:04 coconut oil smells weird

1309 2018-06-03 21:05:07 Because he can't peddle the snake oil talisman that Pres. Trump is evil. People are improving. Don Lemon believes the lies of his own false religion. And he refuses to see he was lied to and lose face. But hey that's jyst my opinion.
1310 2018-06-03 21:05:07 Maybe you could try (don't laugh) giving her a little foot massage while you cuddle up before bedtime. Just a teensy bit of coconut oil on your hands & nice slow (non-tickly) strokes - it's incredibly soothing & could help her relax into sleep.
1311 2018-06-03 21:04:58 Modern south Indian diet is heavy on refined oil or ghee (north indians & Brahmins) and we eat fatty yoghurt too. That is why we vegetarians have high incidence of heart disease in India . 1 TSP of oil is 120 calories and has carcinogens too.  Traditional diet was not oil heavy
1312 2018-06-03 21:04:55 trump has entered into an oil parternership with Russia , Iran oil out put & production threaten the oil price scam of the market , with Iran out of the way the price fix is in place  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ !?!

1315 2018-06-03 21:04:41 Biafra is not Nigeria, stop calling Biafra Nigeria, Biafra is existing for thousands of years before Nigeria, The name Nigeria is just designed by British to blanket Biafra, only for oil.
1316 2018-06-03 21:04:38 So instead of paying $200 to get my headlights changed and my oil changed I just need my man to my patient and luckily he loves what he does.
1317 2018-06-03 21:04:34 Suggestions of things NOT to use:

Sharpie white oil pen

White out pen

I've used them before and they kinda suck real bad but probably cuz Idk how to use things correctly 

I'm trying to find good white pens too so I'm not sure myself :'))
1318 2018-06-03 21:04:31 Anytime uncle 
1319 2018-06-03 21:04:19 Where is Canada and Mexico getting their steel ? It's an abuse of nafta ,,where do we get oil ?  If you actually knew the answers to those questions ,you wouldn't be running your mouth .

1323 2018-06-03 21:03:46 The fact that you use the term ‘tar sands’ says all we need to know about you. Let me know when u find a more responsible country that produces oil. Until then shut your hole and stop accepting the money we send you.
1324 2018-06-03 21:03:41 I hate bitches that don’t take care of their toes  if you’re not gonna get pedicures okay whatever but at least put a clear coat and some cuticle oil on them bitches
1325 2018-06-03 21:03:40 Some oil from TMP is refined in the oil refinery in Burnaby and turned into gasoline used in Vancouver.

1330 2018-06-03 21:03:08 O Pedro Parente foi malandro. Entrou no fundo e saiu no topo o Oil.    Ele sabe q agora é  pedreira e ladeira abaixo...  

Talvez o verdadeiro  motivo da renúncia
1331 2018-06-03 21:03:00 Despite the national population rising by 20% and economy growing by 87% since 1990, carbon dioxide emissions have only increased by 3%! Oil and gas companies’ emission reduction efforts have clearly been effective!
1332 2018-06-03 21:02:54 I scheduled trims on my calendars. So that depends on how fast it grows, it’s once a month for me.
Weekly deep condition.
Natural products.
Twist outs before or everything with a sealant such as olive oil or coconut oil. 
I never met my hair go dry.
1333 2018-06-03 21:02:51 You would think someone would have that done in 5 minutes.
1334 2018-06-03 21:02:43 Difference is these  don’t  profess theirselves to be religious or devote Christians. The Asian no sorry,  the Pakistani men that involved in large scale grooming profess to be devote Muslim praying 5 times a day. I have interview one and he didn’t believe it’s Haram or wrong 
1335 2018-06-03 21:02:36 I have no issue calling out the Edmonton Oilers on the questionable decisions they make & have done so on many an occasion. However,  the fact some are trying to make something out of them signing Keegan Lowe is beyond idiotic. Not everyone who plays in the AHL can be 20.

1340 2018-06-03 21:01:39 I’m no economics powerhouse but gasoline and airline prices go up after every Memorial Day to take advantage of consumers increasing summer travel. Oil and airline companies never come right out and say they are taking advantage of the increased demand, nevertheless, prices 
1341 2018-06-03 21:01:38 @narendramodi Please take some actions to reduce the OIL prices.  We must win 2019 election too.

1349 2018-06-03 21:00:27 This is obviously about trump pandering to oil oligarchs to raise the price of oil.

1352 2018-06-03 21:00:18 There’s plenty of jobs if people are willing to work, just come to West Texas, the oil field will put you right to work
1353 2018-06-03 21:00:15 Why is it that airlines raise prices and add fees every time oil prices go up to a certain point but never drop fees or prices when they go back down below that point?
1354 2018-06-03 21:00:10 June 03, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1355 2018-06-03 21:00:09 Take a potatoey and peel it, cut it in half and slice thin, little bit of oil, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning. Just wrap it all in a foil pack and cook.
1356 2018-06-03 21:00:07 Two days ago, I almost injured my hand in the grinding machine ; the injury was like bullshit for most people. I had to go the clinic to rap it up so that no oil or chemicals are affecting. the doc pressured my hand and I almost collapsed  modafucka

1363 2018-06-03 20:59:18 A lot still needs to be done in scaling up efforts in Agriculture. For the modest economic growth recorded so far to be sustained, it must not be driven by oil alone. #Agriculture #Export
1364 2018-06-03 20:59:17 Hmmm.. maybe that means higher crude prices to further stimulate investment = no further oil production at this time.

1372 2018-06-03 20:58:15 Today is a much nicer day to get some work done. Just have to look up the torque values for the tensioner and the pulley bolts, slap the new belt on, dump some oil in the engine, and check that off the list.
1373 2018-06-03 20:58:14 Long overdue for an oil diffuser.
1374 2018-06-03 20:58:06 So you are ok with Petrol at current prices and the fact that when oil prices fell consumers did not benefit and are bearing the brunt of rising prices now?
1375 2018-06-03 20:58:03 if you have a heart, start helping Iranian with their oil revenue, prisons are full no human rights, not enough jobs people have 2 jobs trying to feed the family, you talking about beliefs and moral can't-fool me, old  man.

1380 2018-06-03 20:57:25 I'm talking specifically about Trump/Pruitt decision to pull from Paris. There was greed because coal/oil/gas/chem executives that contribute to them were the powers behind decision, as well as Trump's spite for Obama & Pruitt's spite for EPA. Ignorance because they deny science.
1381 2018-06-03 20:57:00 @checkupcbc i am very angry that the Trudeau government gave 4.5 billion to a Texas oil company. Why not put it on pharmacare, childcare, retraining oil workers in the Green Economy. This is a crime, a theft from Canadian citizens. We should be removing oil subsidies.

1389 2018-06-03 20:55:59 Why not just use 700 to buy full local chicken then kill it, use 200 kerosene to boil it, add salt, pepper, curry, tyme and Maggi all for 300. Now use power oil of 250 to fry it..
1390 2018-06-03 20:55:59 McCarthy is a snake oil salesman on steroids.
1391 2018-06-03 20:55:58 That guy hugging @channingtatum gave me flashbacks of a 13 year old me being hugged by Peter Andre after he’d come straight off stage. Channing, take if from me, that oil is NEVER coming off your clothes  #BGTfinal2018
1392 2018-06-03 20:55:56 #Iran & #Iraq begin exchanging crude oil as crude from #Kirkuk in northern Iraq is being shipped by trucks to Iran which will return same amount to Iraqi ports in the south.
1393 2018-06-03 20:55:55 Venezuela is being  brought down by   embargos by the U.S. & allies.
Corporate Oil companies want their ownership of Venezuela's oil back again.
Learn more about the situation.
You are misinforming people.
1394 2018-06-03 20:55:50 y'all! i put lavender oil on my neck and on the other side of my pillow case and had the best sleep i've had in months. 5/5 Maras recommend.
1395 2018-06-03 20:55:39 The World Cup opener between Russia and Saudi Arabia will show us who hates gays and loves oil more. Winner should play the Confederacy #WorldCup
1396 2018-06-03 20:55:34 Some days like today especially I just want to quit breast feeding to be able to use CBD oil for my sadness.
1397 2018-06-03 20:55:33 @Anaridis If you haven’t researched the 1973 Oil embargo you should. Imagine today: Only allowed to get gasoline every other day based on the last digit of you license plate. Even or odd number. Gas lines so long people were running out of gas to get gas. 
1398 2018-06-03 20:55:30 Yeah, I see those here too. I’ve got a lot of friends in the oil field or construction and they are out in long sleeves working in this heat. It’s crazy!
1399 2018-06-03 20:55:30 And another thing! Why am I suddenly craving a Bloody Mary and some peanuts? Or pretzels...less oil...

1401 2018-06-03 20:55:10 You are fooling no one.  Snake Oil salesman should stick with their snakes.
1402 2018-06-03 20:55:06 Peter Griffiths is calling from Victoria. He believes that we should be creating and selling products to prop up our economy, instead of transporting and selling oil.
1403 2018-06-03 20:55:04 "Coastal elites?" Why must you say that? Why do you see thriving & highly educated economic centers of power 2 be so different than middle America? We all play a part: whole country is beautiful because farmers, Wall Street, tech, Hollywood, Small Towns, Oil Ind. & immigrants etc
1404 2018-06-03 20:55:03 it has also been used to support the less fortunate provs. Then please explain how PQ gets 10x+more than ON. It looks like pandering and vote buying!! PQ can have pipelines but AB can't. PQ claim enviro but dumps sewage. Hypocrisy much? PQ should support AB Oil -more money for PQ
1405 2018-06-03 20:54:58 @Tesco hi Tesco and every little helps - every person asking you to move up your targets to ditch palm oil must help. In the meantime could you clearly label products so customers can make choices without having to hunt around the small print?
1406 2018-06-03 20:54:46 Come take them!
1407 2018-06-03 20:54:38 When the price of oil was low they never lower the prices
1408 2018-06-03 20:54:31 OMG even HRC wanter snake oil Comey fired.. & Trump fired the leaker ..
1409 2018-06-03 20:54:27 Actually at this time of year I discover that all vegetables are good cooked in olive oil and served cold with lemon juice. Grilled cheese too.
1410 2018-06-03 20:54:22 Apply a product containing salicylic acid directly to pimples to absorb oil and reduce size.

1412 2018-06-03 20:54:04 Ray. Grey. Lamp. Oil. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Lamp Nation attacked
1413 2018-06-03 20:53:57 The US is energy self sufficient so it’s not from military - that actually reduces oil production. Pipelines use vastly less land than wind, or even the grids transporting wind electricity (what little there is).
1414 2018-06-03 20:53:43 @CBC the selling of oil has nothing to do with renewable energy!!! The world climate is not impacted by canada and our ethical oil industry. China, india and others are the issue

1416 2018-06-03 20:53:31 I thought he ditched Twitch to become a full-time poker soap opera director and snake oil salesman for crypto. Not that I don't enjoy the occasional #morerakeisbetter remark.
1417 2018-06-03 20:53:14 @checkupcbc
#Alberta's just emerging from recession, so we're a little sensitive about people obstructing infrastructure when #oiljobs are at stake. Seems environmentalists only satisfied if we shut #oilandgas off altogether. Then they'd have to import oil
1418 2018-06-03 20:53:01 i shaved with jojoba oil and yesssss. closest, softest shave i ever had.
1419 2018-06-03 20:52:56 @realDonaldTrump congrats on job no.s but gotta watch negotis w allies no trade wars sir !

1420 2018-06-03 20:52:53 From a place you will never see

Will come a sound you will never hear.
1421 2018-06-03 20:52:29 I was going to suggest this PLUS, if you can get oil between the two bowls.  Basically, combine all the ideas... 
1422 2018-06-03 20:52:15 EVERY Alaskan gets a UBI dividend...PER YEAR... it is about $2078, per PERSON... per year... 173/mo... is paid for by Oil Revenues. How many people in California? 35.11million. ALASKA? 643,786.... Alaska's money to California for comparison...
173*35,110,000=6,074,030,000. 6Bn.
1423 2018-06-03 20:52:03 The amount of macrolides in ambrette seeds and angelica root oil on the other hand is not sufficient to use  these as pure musk ingredients, they are rather  musk nuanceurs.
1424 2018-06-03 20:52:00 Not seen that much oil since Dallas
1425 2018-06-03 20:51:53 Joe is calling from Edmonton. He believes that the government didn't have much of a choice in buying out this pipeline, because Canadians rely heavily on oil.
1426 2018-06-03 20:51:48 Lmao it's oil, you don't inject it 
1427 2018-06-03 20:51:47 No photo, but tonight's supper is rigatoni with homemade gravy, Italian sausage, garlic bread & applesauce cake. Oh, and a tomato, garlic & olive oil salad.
1428 2018-06-03 20:51:43 And the price of oil is going up due to the instability @ReaalDonalTrump is injecting into the global markets. Double whammy.
1429 2018-06-03 20:51:37 From a health standpoint you can’t answer that unless you know the detail of the diet. Drinking half a litre of oil a day with vegan processed foods is worse than consuming predominately veg with organically raised meat. From an ethics standpoint...
1430 2018-06-03 20:51:28 Yep. The purchaser wanted a selection of more left field flavours. Others are truffle oil truffles, blue cheese, basil in white chocolate, blackcurrant & basil, elderflower... Also available as 24 salted caramels/pralines/gianduja for the less adventurous;-)
1431 2018-06-03 20:51:28 The amount of macrolides in ambrette seeds and angelica root oil on the other hand is not sufficient to use these as pure musk ingredients, they are rather  musk nuanceurs.
1432 2018-06-03 20:51:22 Its our hope that trucks carrying the oil won't vanish along the way or engage in black market
1433 2018-06-03 20:51:17 Concealment, actually. Heh.
1434 2018-06-03 20:51:05 Probably some grilled cheese sandwiches, garlic bread, or just eating it with oil and vinegar.

1441 2018-06-03 20:50:48 I applied olive oil to my nails because I read about it and my phone died. How’s your day going?
1442 2018-06-03 20:50:46 It was only after I left the store with just baby oil, a snickers bar, and romaine lettuce, did I realize my transaction probably appeared odd to the cashier.
1443 2018-06-03 20:50:16 You're sick anty
1444 2018-06-03 20:50:14 Cranky bot needs an oil can enema. Loosen up all those internal joints. He’ll feel better after.
1445 2018-06-03 20:50:11 Can't imagine Baxter, Lancaster or Schmidt ever being in a fued the way Eddie Jones is. 

Didn't think England could get lower than 2005 but here we are. RFU have bought snake oil and it's too late to do anything but double down.
1446 2018-06-03 20:50:08 i just put on tanning oil thinking it was sun screen 
1447 2018-06-03 20:50:01 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.

1450 2018-06-03 20:49:53 Not even close Einstein First of all we are now the largest exporter of gas So the prices go up the US benefits. Our oil companies benefit and get paid. Oh and when the prices drop & it will Our companies will survive without raising prices. Please research figure out the rest!

1455 2018-06-03 20:49:07 John, I have a confession. I picked up a luscious bunch of organic parsley this afternoon, and my favorite spaghetti, when I was at the supermarket. It was only when I returned home that I realized I had about 1/2 tsp of olive oil left. RIP

1461 2018-06-03 20:48:32 Oil prices are half of the peak in 2008
1462 2018-06-03 20:48:28 Alberta is just coming out of the most serious recession since the 80's, so investing tax dollars in oil, as we did with the auto industry, makes sense economically. The feds will get their money back with profit

Even Nuke program could be disposed of ? Taken back ? with ICBMs ?= questions ? or answers ? But wrong - seems real !
1467 2018-06-03 20:47:43 I spent my life in oil refining. A woman engineer will be paid more and promoted faster than a man with all other things equal.

1469 2018-06-03 20:47:00 Deeds, not words. @RepErikPaulsen We are paying for Dean’s campaign as we go. And if he were buying it, I would greatly prefer that to the folks that bought you: the Koch’s, the Mercer’s, the NRA, the oil companies, big pharmaceutical and on and on and on.

1472 2018-06-03 20:46:46 The question is which elements are favored. Compare the US, Germany & Denmark for example (while I always am uncomfortable about the "Scandinavians" in that regard because they have this ultimate edge of small pop., strong economies AND valuable resources like oil/gas).
1473 2018-06-03 20:46:34 Funny how the only thing that gets smaller is the seat size and leg space.Why didn’t the tickets cost less when oil was $50 a barrel?

1475 2018-06-03 20:46:29 Wealthy farmers, coal companies & oil industry executives made a little less money because they couldn't dump sludge. I'm sure some communities were hurt. But FAR FAR more ppl are hurt by the sludge/poison/CO2/pollution/chemicals. As world progresses, ppl must change & adapt.
1476 2018-06-03 20:46:28 Ppl threw cauldrons with burning oil while their citadels were under assault & the next day were perfectly capable to use it just to cook, weren't they? At least that's the way I see it.

1492 2018-06-03 20:43:40 Lol and then frying requires sooooo much oil. But they literally only take like a minute to fry. It’s all the rising that takes time. But yea if I move somewhere with a dope donut shop I’d probably never make them again.

1494 2018-06-03 20:43:20 here comes the barbarian hoardes from the west teaching tropical people how to live their lives while living on canola oil themselves. These barbarians are probably on monsanto / canola sponsorships targetting rival palm oil industry and plantations.

1506 2018-06-03 20:41:11 The EU supplied 30% of our food in 2016. We supplied 49%. We get most of Oil and Gas from Norway. Can’t find figures to contest your medicine figure, but can’t find anything to support it either. Trade agreements take years to be made, so we will be in limbo for some time.

1522 2018-06-03 20:39:31 Exporting is a wrong road to follow. It would have been best to wait a little longer and have all logistics in place to process and refine our own oil. We will not maximize on the proceeds; fact. An open avenue for corruption has been created. Sad.

1524 2018-06-03 20:39:08 Uy where did u buy the coconut oil?
1525 2018-06-03 20:39:06 
1526 2018-06-03 20:38:54 Stuck together like, just sealed (vacuum)? I'd try dish detergent or oil. Anything that may break the seal... If they're stuck like by a sticky substance, soaking. With either sitch I'd try prying apart with a silicone utensil, so they don't break.
1527 2018-06-03 20:38:46 Like that, fried so it’s crispy on the outside, it’s great. Real subtle flavour though, hence I cooked it in sesame oil. I think in that dish, the veg with teriyaki is all flavour, while the tofu is an interesting texture to go with it. Start with stir fries!
1528 2018-06-03 20:38:45 Apparently SoFlo hates America. Sad.  I’m glad I love my country.
1529 2018-06-03 20:38:41 No we don't. The US is going to be an energy exporter in a couple of years and they only buy oil from us at a discount. What do they need us for ?
1530 2018-06-03 20:38:37 You need to seek therapy
1531 2018-06-03 20:38:36 Word around the office is you've got a fat cock

i got a fat cock too

maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime

maybe a little oil?
1532 2018-06-03 20:38:28 @jamesmartinchef great 2 see you do wiener schnitzel! if you dont mind a tip from a viennese-use pork lard and oil instead of butter (really!), and have the schnitzel swimming in it, the result will be amazing. i come round to demonstrate ha!
1533 2018-06-03 20:38:26 U meant oil that is going to be extracted from Turkana can only be used to refil tukutuku alone..Hiyo noma.
1534 2018-06-03 20:38:20 Can't get enough of the old school uniforms this weekend between @whitesox @Brewers ...love it!!!
1535 2018-06-03 20:38:19 Actually, While seeking knowledge you dnt discriminate, you'll pick what you think is good n leave the rest,I wish he has a diff platform to air his personal opinion not under the umbrella of the deen.

The oil blotted from one serving can power Milwaukee for 2 days.
1537 2018-06-03 20:38:08 I will black castor oil my scalp until that new growth starts and he in heaven. Old plaits look better idc idc idc
1538 2018-06-03 20:38:06 I just made a simple but tasty salad dressing using just a few ingredients, and I loved it. Olive oil, lemon juice, fresh minced garlic cloves, salt and pepper. It was delicious on the salad.
I thank God that my health is better than it once was.
1539 2018-06-03 20:38:04 I think you gonna need some baby oil for me to spread on that sexy, brown frame of yours. Let me lay and grind on your ass...all day!!
1540 2018-06-03 20:38:02 Kenya, tarihinde ilk kez ham petrol ihraç etmeye başladı. 2012'de İngiliz Şirketi Tullow Oil tarafından 750 milyon varillik petrol keşfedilmişti.
1541 2018-06-03 20:37:57 If its well managed oil resources will help grow our economy.
1542 2018-06-03 20:37:56 Would be cooler if Willy was on an old triumph with a rag hanging out of jacket to wipe the oil off his shoes!
1543 2018-06-03 20:37:39 #BGTFinal I Wana crawl up my own arse oil #wiggle #cringe 
1544 2018-06-03 20:37:38 60-70% of KM product now is consumed in BC.  Your statements are bald faced lies.  Almost all oil exported is to the USA.  Canada refines gas and diesel but I suspect most of the diesel and gasoline sold in BC is from Washington or California.  You are not adding value to convo
1545 2018-06-03 20:37:23 Mix equal weights of egg, flour, sugar and oil. Bake for 40 minutes. It's called CAKE and is cheap and palatable.
1546 2018-06-03 20:36:58 Trump removes Obama obstacles to oil and coal production and the US will soon overtake Saudi Arabia as the number 1 energy producing country.  And you give credit to Obama 
1547 2018-06-03 20:36:58 The gas station attendant would not only pump the gas for you, but would clean your windows and check your engine oil level.
1548 2018-06-03 20:36:55 I also do a lot of veggies in my own Chinese dishes, I use coconut oil instead of whatever the restaurants use and omit the sugar... just want to give you some tips. One other thing you may enjoy I get strawberries serve them with strawberry cream cheese and whipped cream lol
1549 2018-06-03 20:36:47 Too bad so many here seem to forget that $1.5 billion oil spill response plan is tied to getting KM pipeline built. If you kill KM, you kill both, leaving the Coast with the bare-bones response capability it has now.
1550 2018-06-03 20:36:37 Now is the time to build up our oil cony so that we have strength in bargaining. Make Canada Great again.
1551 2018-06-03 20:36:31 This guy hasn't heard the story of Standard Oil.
1552 2018-06-03 20:36:15 Unless Billy has backing of an Oil Shiek or  Mafia mobster unlikely he would be competing any better than were doing right now
1553 2018-06-03 20:36:07 In honor of me, Doritos will be making a chip that tastes like bitterness and baby oil.
1554 2018-06-03 20:36:01 Toh truth Sayer, you are part of the people he is talking about if you know the kind of man he is why going to his place to study??  Biko let me rest abeg
1555 2018-06-03 20:35:59 Hmm I think I might have to give em a try, I’ve been using natural coconut oil for my wavy hair and think those products would definitely benefit me just as well 
1556 2018-06-03 20:35:55 The evaporation of 'Fleur de Peau' commences with metallic-cold aldehydes  and an angelica root vibe (naturally featuring also Exaltolide/Thibetolide) in a  splash of bergamot, accented by pink pepper and with added sweetness by a touch of carrot seed oil.
1557 2018-06-03 20:35:47 Saudi bribes its people into obedience, like the Emiratis, theres a difference imho
Mubaraks Egypt had some liberties, within limits, but Sissi's comes close i think

Gaddafi's Libya i think could be compared, but even here bribing people with the oil wealth happened.
1558 2018-06-03 20:35:35 I need an oil change, hair do & more shit. I’m tired of spending my own money
1559 2018-06-03 20:35:18 I agree with you John but unfortunately my husband misses it now he is living in the UK, I keep trying to convert him to mayonnaise but he keeps begging for Miracle Whip, I am not going to pay $40 a jar for oil, help:)
1560 2018-06-03 20:35:16 These oil diffusers are like the best gift to get your ole girl 
1561 2018-06-03 20:35:13 K it probably doesn’t even need a oil change
1562 2018-06-03 20:35:06 exactly, you need to hound them, it's gonna be a sight effect of the oil leak/crash that they didn't fix properly
1563 2018-06-03 20:34:59 A little bit of oil around where they're locked tight? And maybe a knife tip? I bet it only needs one small seal-break....
1564 2018-06-03 20:34:53 Shit i put on oil and I’m out in the sun
1565 2018-06-03 20:34:42 So I went to get an oil change and tell me why my lovely bitch as car has problems of the amount of $600 lmao I don’t have any kids but fuck It I’m taking StepDaddy Applications I need the help.!
1566 2018-06-03 20:34:35 A refinery needs a lot of water which L. Turkana can’t sustainably provide. Second the area is quite fragile security wise so crude oil transportation is safer rather than refined petroleum. But then again this is Kenya, the business might be logistics and not the actual oil
1567 2018-06-03 20:34:29 Where do you get your information?  Suncor is publicly traded, mostly owned by Canadians.  I do not know who markets the oil from the oilsands.  Liquified natural gas, molten sulfur are shipped by train to the west coast.  We know we watch it every day.
1568 2018-06-03 20:34:14 I hate being nearby Hobby Lobby on a Sunday and thinking "hey, I could pick up some more canvases/oil paints" only to realize IT'S A FREAKING SUNDAY!!!
1569 2018-06-03 20:34:09 If an oil company was run by toddlers, they could outsmart the Liberal Party of Canada.
1570 2018-06-03 20:33:59 any ardell wispies and use castor oil at night to help your lashes grow
1571 2018-06-03 20:33:58 nothing better than putting coconut oil on fresh shaven legs 
1572 2018-06-03 20:33:43 As I turn life a page to the land of the great Osage
To those Oklahoma Hills where I was born
Where the black oil rolls and flows
And the snow-white cotton grows
In those Oklahoma Hills where I was born 
1573 2018-06-03 20:33:38 hmm, oil? messy but it might help
1574 2018-06-03 20:33:38 Give her some knowledge too, show her how to work on cars, change oil, teach her how to drive stick shift. Idk maybe that’s me lol little things like that she can learn and hold onto forever. Plus it’s good for bonding and it’s fun. Women would understand us more haha
1575 2018-06-03 20:33:32 My problem is oil tycoons are well known for self interest blood shade in mostly Mideast countries and Africa.  Will this happen to our peaceful country??
1576 2018-06-03 20:33:28 Isn't that smart, we have our own oil why would the dipshit buy it from foreign countries
1577 2018-06-03 20:33:19 I'm my getting my oil changed today  I just wanna sleep in
1578 2018-06-03 20:33:17 Kind of makes you wonder why the price is going up when the price of a barrel is going down. Does Trump have friends in the oil industry?
1579 2018-06-03 20:33:12 Kai mutumina... Kayi magana wallahi
1580 2018-06-03 20:33:12 Fact is this proposed law cannot be passed at the moment. Because oil account for not less than 80% of out national earning. Except they is a political will to strengthen other sectors  with same money. Only then will this happen
1581 2018-06-03 20:33:08 I agree, they said if the problems are related to the oil leak, they'll reimburse me. But I can't risk paying the inspection costs upfront, for them to say no. It's their fuck up, they should sort it
1582 2018-06-03 20:33:02 My mom said deer park taste like oil and i couldn’t agree more
1583 2018-06-03 20:33:00 Maybe it was the baby oil that made the difference for Lex!
1584 2018-06-03 20:32:53 me: i love oil painting
body: im gonna make you allergic to it
1585 2018-06-03 20:32:50 She sells clothes for women, men and children, she has a recipe website, she sells natural oil based beauty products very affordable and their amazing! I use it, she uses it, my dad, my son and my niece and she does videos on YouTube too
1586 2018-06-03 20:32:46 In a just world, one of the pits of hell must be reserved for people who put oil filters on too tight. 
1587 2018-06-03 20:32:46 Know this—the more Trump does to try to excite his base, he increases excitement on the opposing side 10x more. This is a fight for the soul of the country, and don’t for a second think Dems aren’t up for it. Trump’s gaslighting fools only the ppl willing to buy his snake oil.
1588 2018-06-03 20:32:42 No, it recognizes that it is better to sell our ethical oil while the world is moving off of fossil fuels.
1589 2018-06-03 20:32:34 me in line at the T* M*xx holding three (3) different bottles of lavender essential oil, with my freshly Lavender Scented Body Washed arms and hair: its pride month Bilch!
1590 2018-06-03 20:31:47 There is a product called Swimguard, you put it in before swimming and it helps a bit. Swim caps help, rinsing after being in the pool and putting oil in will help keep the color too.
1591 2018-06-03 20:31:32 Use peppermint oil mixed with water in spray bottle.   Have a hot bucket of water underneath when you knock down nest with broom.
1592 2018-06-03 20:31:29 Much better is @JimJams_Spreads or @PeanutButterCo #DarkChocolate Dreams using less sugar and sustainable palm oil 
1593 2018-06-03 20:31:27 Why aren’t the tax savings by large oil companies being passed on to consumers? File that under “rhetorical question,” I guess.
1594 2018-06-03 20:31:27 PSA: Air fryers are a lie. They do not produce delicious fried things in the way that oil fryers do.
1595 2018-06-03 20:31:09 So your position does not revolve around oil and gas at all ? Everything in West Texas revolves around oil and gas from Walmart to getting a haircut
1596 2018-06-03 20:30:49 Even if it's early or late oil. In whose account are the funds being deposited the owners of ngamia or the camel ??
1597 2018-06-03 20:30:32 Now now. Things will get better. 
Have you tried rubbing yourself in olive oil to improve your deliciousness?
1598 2018-06-03 20:30:29 If ur gonna put oil and vinegar on salad you might as well not use the oil don’t @me
1599 2018-06-03 20:30:27 My guess is Wacha wanted no part of that top of 9th...
1600 2018-06-03 20:30:27 Coconut oil price is Rs 230 that's produced in India plenty, whereas oil is traded now $89 in free market, I paid euro 1.47 today, no state can control, only tax reduction & reduce consumption. Some spent 10l with 2 vechicles at home n cry for 5₹, just adjust life
1601 2018-06-03 20:30:22 You a chocolate stallion. Baby oil on you must be a sight!!
1602 2018-06-03 20:30:15 What is this super supplement I’m talking about? It’s not fish or krill oil, but it’s a stellar way to get your Omega-3’s phospholipid-bo...
1603 2018-06-03 20:30:14 I am an atheist..but yeah, good question..Why would you seek shelter in a haram culture when there are oil rich muslim countries all around you?
1604 2018-06-03 20:30:09 City fans will be Burnley fans once they get oil money too. Yup, squad didn’t hit too many out this year but I’m all for Babe Ruth Jr. doing his thing now lol.
1605 2018-06-03 20:30:07 Venezuela: what happens when a deeply soulful, proud country with the greatest oil reserves on earth succumbs to ideological hubris and political chicanery geared towards annihilating the hopes of an entire generation. I wonder what Simón Bolívar would think of all this?
1606 2018-06-03 20:30:06 McCarthy has been spot on re: Trump/Russia.  
I don't think he has the depth in trade.  Is anyone aware that Mexico imposes restrictions or tariffs on many products including beef, apples, soy oil, liquid  caustic soda, hydrogen peroxide,  bond paper, welded carbon steel pipe...
1607 2018-06-03 20:30:04 To select a healthy cooking oil, look for expeller- pressed or cold-pressed oils to ensure you are buying high-quality, undamaged oil. Oi...
1608 2018-06-03 20:29:59 We’re at 76 USD per barrel today. UAE have increased the petrol prices when we had the Oil down term for better profit, and now Oil prices are increasing; however, nothing done yet with the petrol P&L to adjust for that increase!
1609 2018-06-03 20:29:54 Cooking oil mixed with sugar might be the best of both worlds but...... er...... "interesting".... :-p
1610 2018-06-03 20:29:52 Bloody thing just kept going ... and going and going. A little oil now and then and a bit of water ... couldn't stop the beast !!!
1611 2018-06-03 20:29:44 Contra o clickbait: Oil Pulling, o chamado “Kavala ou Gundusha” é uma prática de higiene dental da medicina ayurvédica. O óleo extrai bactérias e toxinas de suas gengivas, dentes e glândulas salivares, pulando em torno de 10 a 20 minutos.

de nada.
1612 2018-06-03 20:29:38 U a release the oil inna u back now that’s y

1614 2018-06-03 20:29:28 The few I have are stained and spotted with oil.  Someday that’s how my kids will know those were the best recipes.
1615 2018-06-03 20:29:17 No suncream   ... but baby oil .. Hmm
1616 2018-06-03 20:29:13 Ei so one man dey wey dey collect 3.5 percent shares of Ghana oil revenue??? O'Lord i need this breakthrough

1620 2018-06-03 20:28:58 Looks like the owner uses the same oil to do his hair. 
1621 2018-06-03 20:28:44 Tea tree oil has changed my life and my skin 
1622 2018-06-03 20:28:38 Petrol is refined in the U.K. ( we are the only one’s with our own oil ) , medicines are international as is food . Bullshit
1623 2018-06-03 20:28:34 And by the way in whose account are the 2 yr oil "samples" revenues being credited another IFMIS or NYS in the offing?  Has treasury opened a "ngamia" oil deposit account or the owner of the camel knows best ?? Just asking ?
1624 2018-06-03 20:28:31 You are taking our oil to UK.
You Brought in UN tankers to Transport Oil from Turkana to a shell Oil Ship in Mombasa then to Shell refinery in the Gulf. 
Looting from the poor. Tullow is a British Firm.
1625 2018-06-03 20:28:11 Why dont we tap the local market we import crude oil at higher price which affects leaving Std but the moment our crude oil goese to own market it will improve lives 1 barrel of oil world market price is 50dollars 1b=159 litres local retail price 1lt=93ksh/1lt=0.93$
1626 2018-06-03 20:28:07 Eclipsed 1hr for a basic oil change at Walmart....never again
1627 2018-06-03 20:28:06 Fake anointing oil.
1628 2018-06-03 20:28:01 They need to find the budget for crucifixes and burning oil somewhere.
1629 2018-06-03 20:27:57 Honestly wit a day, sent my brother to get sun cream and he came back with this fancy spray, ignoring the alarm bells in my heed, we literally covered ourselves the stuff and went out in the 30 degree heat. We’ve returned to find out it’s tanNING OIL!! Couldn’t write it. Cooked X
1630 2018-06-03 20:27:55 @MediaMuseumPH loved the 2001 showing today, but please will someone oil the curtain runners!
1631 2018-06-03 20:27:53 If proper controls are put in place, every Kenyan will benefit since oil prices will go down drastically reducing the cost of commodity transportation. Basic commodity prices will come down, employment opportunities will surface and general development of infrastructure.
1632 2018-06-03 20:27:43 Single ingredients will give you more kcal/£ but aren't palatable. Cooking oil is around 6000 kcal/£, granulated sugar about 5000kcal/£...
1633 2018-06-03 20:27:38 All true. They may have been taken in by a con artist but they asked for it. Their prejudices, hate, and ignorance made therm susceptible to a snake oil salesman like trump
1634 2018-06-03 20:27:38 Rule: You keep you're first bless oil.
1635 2018-06-03 20:27:35 I very much doubt there would be any food shortages. We produce tons. Tons are also thrown away by supermarkets & shops as waste. Just as well our oil & gas lines come Norway, so there wouldn't be any fuel shortages. All scaremongering as per usual.
1636 2018-06-03 20:27:25 you need to get real old man, need to start concentrating on Iranian people, stop wasting oil revenue in the proxy war in the middle east, people deserve better than this. GOD, will punish you, for  just creating war and misery, injustice,

1640 2018-06-03 20:26:48 can you put tea tree oil on dogs?
1641 2018-06-03 20:26:33 In Margarine ist Palmöl
In Nutella ist Palmöl
In allen möglichen verarbeiteten Lebensmitteln steckt Palmöl

Say no to Palm oil eat butter and potatoes
1642 2018-06-03 20:26:27 Your assertion makes a lot of sense. Inspite of this, take into consideration that we already have a refinery in mombasa, we already have the crude oil at Ngamia. Ngamia should fund its own refinery by having its crude refined in Mombasa.
1643 2018-06-03 20:26:13 I understand that one of the world's best oil expert comes from Kenya. Why can't he be hired to give advise on whether to build a refinery in Turkana or continue exporting the crude oil?

1645 2018-06-03 20:25:55 1: drink a lot of water!! 
2:avoid using face masks everyday. I would stick with cleansers/water every day and face masks twice a week!! 
3: use coconut oil to remove makeup, avoids harsh chemicals used in makeup wipes
4: eat healthy! Eat lots of fruits and greens!

1647 2018-06-03 20:25:45 I don’t understand why everyone suddenly cares about Kanye in the last 2 months. You guys are writing thinkpieces over this man. If you don’t want to feed the fire why are you pouring oil all over it?
1648 2018-06-03 20:25:41 @checkupcbc Liberal MP's who think their seats are not in danger have a rude awakening ahead. Citizens are outraged that these MPs are putting the interests of Big Oil ahead of people. @JonathanWNV repeating the same rhetoric doesn't make it true.

1650 2018-06-03 20:25:17  did you see the baby oil video ? 
1651 2018-06-03 20:25:11 What ever comes from Kenya is not good, it need to be taken to other countries for value addition. We produce clothes here but we have to import clothes. The same  applies to oil.
1652 2018-06-03 20:25:03 chicken popcorn or twister but here it tastes like oil soaked cardboard also I've tried local chicken shops idk why I couldn't stomach their chicken or french fries
1653 2018-06-03 20:24:49 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1654 2018-06-03 20:24:36 Or put them over oil heater and kick them up and release. Feel that heat infiltrate your bed
1655 2018-06-03 20:24:32 yeah gas prices always go up this time of year for the summer and honestly if we bought less foreign gas/oil from opeq then gas prices would be lower. sadly right now the west has made itself subject to what happens with opeq and until that changes we'll suffer.
1656 2018-06-03 20:24:30 "t's a big deal for scots, but for most in England it's pretty meh I suspect."

Do you think so? I think you are wrong and that explains "the project fear" during the Referendum of the Scots"

Just imagine the UK without the oil and what would mean to the UK: the GBP collapse

1658 2018-06-03 20:24:21 560 MILLION GONE FROMTHE PORK INDUSTRY.   YOU GOOFED. BIG TIME. WAIT TIL CANADA STOPS SENDING OIL. LUMBER. FRESH WATER. REAL MAPLE SYRUP.   YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW MR . SO CALLED. PREZ.
1659 2018-06-03 20:23:21 Had these on my kale last year. They spread quickly. Neem oil or insecticidal soap are both effective organic options. Orchard hardware sells a good selection of organic pest control and fertilizers. Good luck!
1660 2018-06-03 20:23:21 Is it just me or does black seed oil and turpentine gum spirits taste the same

Praying for your mom in the powerful name of Jesus. Mercy and grace upon her, and your whole family.
If you live in a med cannabis state, I highly recommend getting her on Rick Simpson Oil ASAP. Sixty - 90 grams over 60-90 days. No guarantees, but hope.
1664 2018-06-03 20:22:59 @AldiUK having checked quite a few packs of food from your stores they all contain #palmoil - why don’t you be the first supermarket to stop using it? Or only use #sustainable palm oil?? Go on!
1665 2018-06-03 20:22:54 Gas station attendants that pumped ur gas cleaned ur windshield and checked the oil! I was scared the first time I had to pump my own gas

1668 2018-06-03 20:22:49 I can’t explain what being high and having peppermint oil on your temples, forehead and back of your neck feels like, but just know it’s a fucking experience.
1669 2018-06-03 20:22:44 While I believe the participation of society in spending decisions is efficient in terms of allocation I also believe little is discussed in the brazilian socity about the revenue side. This is obvious when we look at the latest crisis about oil supply.
1670 2018-06-03 20:22:33 I'm still waiting for an airline CEO to reduce their salary whenever they have the raise ticket prices due to the high cost of oil.
1671 2018-06-03 20:22:16 Since forever but only if it’s cooked with palm oil.
1672 2018-06-03 20:22:08 It might but perhaps a bigger container with soil filled with "live" soil (natural stuff like earthworm castings, guano, fish oil, etc vs fertilizer) will be fine too. Trees explore their container to see how big they can grow a canopy and can get unhappy in typical pots.
1673 2018-06-03 20:22:07 we don't get fuel/oil/petrol from the EU, we make and supply our own medicines and only 15% of our food comes from the EU, PLUS we would be open to trade with other countries who would flood the uk with products cheaper than we get them from the EU
1674 2018-06-03 20:21:59 I put Wild growth oil on my brows ONCE and now they look like bushes
1675 2018-06-03 20:21:55 What would you do when you possess that much oil, and a US tries to steal & rob it by lies and force?
1676 2018-06-03 20:21:48 I’d go with the oil!

1680 2018-06-03 20:21:16 We should ban all sports because athletes take salt pills and electrolites to replenish sodium when the body sweats, fish oil to keep joints in good working order, protein to feed muscles...but why would we keep horses safe?

1684 2018-06-03 20:20:38 That'd have to be one big horse but the space shuttle would look cool.  And both of those would be preferable to perching atop an oil derrick.
1685 2018-06-03 20:20:35 Why do you want the country to fail ? We should just use our own oil we are the number 1 exporter of oil now. If Jerry Brown would stop taxing gasoline Ca citizens would have more money to care for families or parents.

1692 2018-06-03 20:19:39 @delong What would happen if America nationalized the energy industry? What are the advantages to having private nuclear/coal/oil companies? Is the energy industry competitive enough that it being private provides a clear advantage over it being state run?

1696 2018-06-03 20:18:58 But lower oil never results in lower prices. It’s an amazing thing
1697 2018-06-03 20:18:57 That comparison is very weak. Russia has a much more diverse economy than Venezuela. They have a number of other resources and a massive arms exporting industry. Venezuelas entire social safety net was based on oil, when the price crashed it created a brutal domino effect.
1698 2018-06-03 20:18:52 Is it too expensive to refine the oil or quality of crude is bogus and inefficient for local consumption. I wonder?
Plus anyone who alleges it’s too expensive to build a local refinery for this crude is out of their wits. NYS 9B, NCPB 1.9B and on and on....

1700 2018-06-03 20:18:34 Not much. Will add to GHG emissions. Will offer short term gain at the expense of the environment. Oil as fuel is global carfentanil.
1701 2018-06-03 20:18:27 That dawn soap ad where the duck is covered in oil, then they wash him off in dawn soap, then load him in the dishwasher.
1702 2018-06-03 20:18:18 Check the NEB filings; the bulk of commitments for the expanded pipeline are for refineries in the US. A small fraction are shippers shipping oil overseas.
1703 2018-06-03 20:18:11 I really love the ability to use old motor oil. Ton of the guys at the barracks do oil changes. Now its free full to mix in. Bought the 1919 before i ever considered the truck so at the moment i have no Mount. Gonna have to wait to mount it.
1704 2018-06-03 20:18:09 Not an FP person but~seems like the economies suffering the most~or will eventually suffer were/are dependent on gas/oil instead of a diversified market~hence they end up w/volatile socio econ probs vs healthy sustainability~i.e. Venezuela ,Russia, ME &a few countries in Africa

"Check the oil, ma'am?"
1722 2018-06-03 20:16:16 @checkupcbc It’s probably the only way to beat the endless court challenges etc. and get it done. Those against it ignore oil by rail delivery and its far worse record. They say we should do something else. But we’re not the rest of the world, that wants it.
1723 2018-06-03 20:16:14 I went to HEB twice this weekend and both times I forgot to buy peanut oil, shiiiiiiiiiiiiiitttt! Is there ANYONE out there that loves me enough to grab me some peanut oil?! I’ll pay double!
1724 2018-06-03 20:15:55 I’m not sure really I don’t have sensitive skin, but it’s all natural so I think that would be a plus! It helps control oil too
1725 2018-06-03 20:15:45 If I was a president who is claimed to have studied economics and pol sci at university & was on a borrowing spree to "develop" a country I could have built an oil refinery in my country immediately oil was discovered. It is the common sense thing to do. Am not a president though

1738 2018-06-03 20:13:59 Sure,  between the oil rigs, gas wells, and the trophy hunters, there are probably a few trees left...but then there are the fires, because of the Climate Change you all in the Fascist Trump Administration deny! @GOP @TheDemocrats #TrumpIsAFascist #TrumpCabinetGrifters

1744 2018-06-03 20:13:15 CBD Oil does not have any THC in it therefore this is ridiculous @CNN
1745 2018-06-03 20:13:15 Usually use mixed herbs, finely chopped onion, olive oil and red wine. Stir it all in a bowl then tip it over the steak and leave in fridge overnight. The herbs and onion stick to the steak and it absorbs the wine. I am hungry now!

1753 2018-06-03 20:12:29 AND much of trade to the US is crude oil refined in the US creating jobs there. Canada may need to institute a policy of replacing all purchases and sales with the US with sales to more reliable partners.

1756 2018-06-03 20:12:09 That’s it. And it was Texas who started shipping as soon as they could. With Fracking we have a surplus of oil. Also why fuel is so cheap around here.
1757 2018-06-03 20:12:09 So, the military industry funds the US government and calls the shots there, and another industry does the same in Russia, most likely Oil & Gas.
1758 2018-06-03 20:12:03 I was making a #FakeFrenchFriesFacts where the origin of fries was from Algerians throwing cooking oil onto French potato fields in the 1800s and TIL Algeria actually has a sizeable potato industry, producing around 5M tonnes of potatoes in 2013.

1766 2018-06-03 20:11:29 water = human right for everyone. When Kurdistan or Iraq sell oil, than this measure don't affect TR. But when you built a dam and cut the water supply to millions, than you are doing something wrong #WaterCrisis #Kurdistan #Iraq

1775 2018-06-03 20:10:45 Lmao I drove such a shitty car for years that I learned how to change the oil and tires. How to add power steering fluid, coolant and window wiper fluid. How to jump a car, I learned how to fix broken tail lights, How to make my car not over heat 
1776 2018-06-03 20:10:41 It’s probably just recycled motor oil
1777 2018-06-03 20:10:40 French Fries were invented when King Louis XVI fell into a vat of hot vegetable oil. Later versions of the dish replaced Louis' crispy, fatty meat strips with potatoes, due to the lack of Louis meat after that time. #FakeFrenchFriesFacts

The middle easterns are losing clout in the world. Why? Oil is no longer the ‘liquid gold’.

So how do they regain clout?   

1- Solar power monoply (just google and you will see what’s going on)

2- Gold

But most of the gold is held by China, Russia and the US.

1787 2018-06-03 20:09:49 Weaning off of oil is going to take time. I agree we need to put money in sustainable energy but in the meantime we have use oil. We also should be able to move it.
1788 2018-06-03 20:09:29 yes that is true because the USA had a law against/allowing oil/oil goods export dates back to the 1970s (I belive) with issues with OPEC and oil prices

1797 2018-06-03 20:07:45 Scheer,Remple and Harper have been consorting with the enemy(TRUMP AND FOX NEWS) and as such should be charged with treason in trying to undermine the govt of Canada during trade negotiations.These miscreants do not want free trade,nor are they supportive of selling oil worldwide
1798 2018-06-03 20:07:40 It wasn’t until just a couple years ago that we started exporting oil again.

1805 2018-06-03 20:06:45 Ugh, politics and celebrities mix like oil and water. Wish Hollywood would stick to making great movies. It seems their interest in politics has done the opposite of that these days, and it's starting to show at the box office. People watch movies to escape, not to be lectured.
1806 2018-06-03 20:06:45 Kurdistan - A country within a country...... massive oil wealth unable to break free...... Sound familiar?  
1807 2018-06-03 20:06:30 Aw nice. I'm glad to hear that. I've been obsessed with geography since I was a boy and I even had one of those CCTV things that magnified books and put it on a screen so I could read the maps. I particularly loved the map I had containing all known major oil fields at the time.
1808 2018-06-03 20:06:27 Something needs to be done about the oil dumping and other waste. As the Kurds seem to be the ones who managed to 'sweep up' most of ISIS, theyd probably get the job done, because the Iraqi government seem pretty feckless. You think the new government will fair much better?
1809 2018-06-03 20:06:18 I am 61, and am speaking off the back of a career in the international oil exploration industry, and observing how people are treated throughout the world. I apologise if having different views to you makes me me not grown up enough to be worthy of a conversation.

1811 2018-06-03 20:05:45 They use Political Prisoner oil to fry their fries.  I hear it's almost as good as peanut oil.
1812 2018-06-03 20:05:41 Oil prices are not that high specially the kerosene since it's abundant worldwide, they just look for an excuse to make more money. They should ask the gov to lower taxes and insurance companies to lower their costs.
1813 2018-06-03 20:05:40 Tanning oil, mango blue moon, kfc. I’m thriving.
1814 2018-06-03 20:05:28 Gonna oil my scalp and tie it up yah
1815 2018-06-03 20:05:27 To the contrary, it is because I am an independent thinker and can see the horror that is Donald Trump for myself that causes me to be so outraged. It is you that are taken in by the snake oil salesmen and those preaching his message of hate and exclusion! WAKE UP!
1816 2018-06-03 20:05:23 Reports of 32 leaking oil
1817 2018-06-03 20:05:21 How much oil reserves do we have. From the last news I got, it is a very limited amount. Why not refine it in Turkana and export within COMESA?
1818 2018-06-03 20:05:19 1460 days left no legacy nor hope for a better Kenya in sight infact we like nigeria are set to export crude oil and import refined petroleum and oil products..talk about zilch in value addition..this oil will be our curse too..

1823 2018-06-03 20:04:43 Of course zaddy na our oil dey make that skin dey glow like that. True or false.
1824 2018-06-03 20:04:33 That oil barrel is a #Suidlander in South Africa, a #whitegenocide protagonist, in the common attire of black, black shirt fascists, and black jack boots. The obesity is a statement of white privilege and wealth with the mentality of an American redneck.
1825 2018-06-03 20:04:18 oil started running out in the late 1990s and the government cut taxes in the 1980s (to the very rich) ~ instead like Norway invested it where it worth a lot more (their capital wealth fund the biggest in the world) ~ and the sales of oil went abroad and not used by the UK market
1826 2018-06-03 20:04:15 "Fun Facts" are done. I'm into "No Fun Facts" now. 

*Linoleum is primarily made of all  natural products, such as linseed oil from flax, wood powder, limestone,  resins and some colored pigments. The backing is made from jute, which is a natural grass.
1827 2018-06-03 20:04:13 I couldn’t oppose this decision more! How dare the Government use our tax dollars to buy out an American oil company for such an outrageous sum.
1828 2018-06-03 20:04:13 Um...lol...no...that's not at all his stance on oil. He knows that people are stuck on using it (for now), but he is also optimistic about, and trying to move towards renewable, environmentally safe resources. I see him trying to make the best choices that he can for Canadians.

1833 2018-06-03 20:03:47 Instead, let's just ban any product or person named Trump from entering Canada. And let's sell our crude oil to China instead of the US while reducing as much as possible anything purchased from the US.

1846 2018-06-03 20:02:00 There are a million reasons against risking our coast, the BC Tourism Industry and all the industries including FN’s that depend on the coast for their livelihood. There’s only one reason to sell oil to Asia. That’s money! Much like the pros and cons for and against prostitution!
1847 2018-06-03 20:01:46 We need to stop killing our home, earth. Having the technology to get energy from the sun,  wind, etc.makes digging & burning coal & using oil obsolete as well as unhealthy for every form of life on our beautiful planet!

Kenya imported petroleum products worth 211B annually (KNBS, 2016). Additionally, Kenya consumes 84,000 barrels of crude oil per day (USEIA, 2013)

Kenya may get Ksh 103B annually ( 43 USD/barrel) in Early Oil Export if 2,000 barrels will be transported daily.

The truth is that since most products don't look like what you'd expect (ie massage oil bars are not soap) staff talk to people to ensure they don't do something stupid with their purchase then come back and complain about it. :-)
1894 2018-06-03 19:56:43 sorry i forgot to reply to you.. incase you dont know the vat rate in wb is 22.5% if you want the proof i can dm you the rate card.. also, has modi government reduced out on cost of petrol? nope.. the crude oil price went down, still its expensive, for what?
1895 2018-06-03 19:56:42 We didn’t create a power vacuum, we (the West) put stooges in power who would give us cheap oil & multi million contracts & not give a fig about the people. Check out the board of BP & the oil contract they’ve just signed.

1901 2018-06-03 19:55:39 I agree. It’s stupid to blame the religion or their lack of religion.
After all Islam has been in the world for over 1400 years and such attacks have only been happening in the past 30... incidentally just when the wars for oil and opium were renamed “war on terror”.

1909 2018-06-03 19:54:24 Pathetic. This guy has his head deep up his ass. Nothing but a garbage dump will be named after Trump. Most likely he'll flee the country to avoid the sealed indictment awaiting after the snake oil salesman is abruptly terminated.

1912 2018-06-03 19:53:54 Vi levde litt for høyt på oljeinntektene, men det kunne bare ikke vare i lengden. Jeg husker en utgave av The Economist fra begynnelsen av 90-tallet som handlet om Norge. Tittelen, som preget hele forsiden av utgaven, var "By Oil Alone?" Utgaven fikk hovedoppslaget i Dagsrevyen.

1920 2018-06-03 19:52:50 You can also add castor oil. That’s what Kimmaytune puts in her leave in conditioner too. I didn’t have any on hand, but I am going to put some in now that I bought it.

1926 2018-06-03 19:52:10 Tommy Thomas also acted for the PAS State Govt. in the matter against Petronas for claims on Oil Royalty. So that should also make him a supporter of the Islamic Party rite, what say you?
1927 2018-06-03 19:52:05 Well if you do some reading you might discover that trade also involves services and the US sells more than it buys in total from Canada. Take out oil and gas and it sells more than it buys in products as well.
1928 2018-06-03 19:52:01 I took a leave in conditioner that I was not really crazy about, but that I did not want to throw away, and I added a few tablespoons of 100% pure aloe juice & extra virgin olive oil. It’s a recipe that @kimmaytube posted years ago on her YouTube channel.

1934 2018-06-03 19:51:24 Not true of me. I have empathy for all. These wars benefit only the war and oil industries, plus the expanistist ambitions of settlor colonial Israel. Blaming soldiers in anti human especially in the US where most middle class people don’t know even know one person involved.
1935 2018-06-03 19:51:21 The elites are busy salivating on the black gold in turkana, to an area that is highly marginalized you'd think the 5% of the revenue would benefit... Neo-colonialism is extracting oil from the county then exporting it for refinery.
Tuko na ujinga Tu!!
1936 2018-06-03 19:51:18 The idea that oil competes without foreign military occupations, government siezing of land for pipelines, and other oil subsidies is hilarious.

cartel interests of the Anglo-American companies. To the fury of the Iraqis and the French, it held down production to maximize profits elswhere. The company kept a monopoly of Iraq's oil sector until nationalization in 1972.

Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Secretary, denied that oil interests influenced policy in Iraq, but the archives show that the British government rushed troops to Mosul in 1918 to gain control of the northern oil fields. Britain and France clashed over Iraq's

1946 2018-06-03 19:49:40 Swiss wealth is also historic as is their v expensive cost of living (food prices etc).
Norway's wealth is from good management of oil revenues. I agree Norway is good but even Norway doesn't recommend their relationship with the EU. 
Even Yannis Varafoukis thinks we're bonkers.

1949 2018-06-03 19:49:18 @checkupcbc Oil sands are a mixture of sand, water, clay & bitumen. Bitumen is simply oil that is too thick to flow or be pumped without being diluted or heated. Canada’s oil sands are found in 3 deposits – the Athabasca, Peace River & Cold Lake areas in Alberta and part of Sask.

I pay $40+ per tank for my gas vehicle (2 weeks).
My electric vehicle needs no gas, oil, tune-up or exhaust system.
You don't need a degree in economics to see the big picture

1964 2018-06-03 19:48:07 Anything can happen in Kenya. Not sure if what Kenyan president launched/flagged today was crude oil or water ? Let us wait for crude oil scandals.

Certain governor used CLEAN WATER tankers to launch dry boreholes. After the launch event the water stopped running from the taps.

1967 2018-06-03 19:47:23 The point of confederation is not to get oil to tidewater ffs. Furthermore, oil has been going to tidewater for about 60yrs, separating would make it indefinitely more difficult if AB were a foreign nation attempting to push more brainiac. If u were ABn you’d know that.
1968 2018-06-03 19:47:10 Pulling into a gas station and having someone come up to your car and ask how much gas you wanted so they could fill it up for you. They would check the tires, check the oil, wash the windows etc.

2000 2018-06-03 19:43:04 Vitamin D and fish oil are also very beneficial
2001 2018-06-03 19:43:00 There are a million reasons against risking our coast, the BC Tourism Industry and all the industries including FN’s that depend on the coast for their livelihood.

2006 2018-06-03 19:41:59 Who in the name of sanity gives an oil producing company a tax rebate instead of charging them tax. Meanwhile Norway was taking tax from the same company.
2007 2018-06-03 19:41:57 Yeah G said the oil should be almost smoking. It certainly wasn't as hot as you described. Quite thick as well, like a quiche. Not fluffy. Hey ho, it got eaten.
2008 2018-06-03 19:41:51 Globalism is a good strategy to prevent war. When all of our (world) interests are similar the likelihood is peace will break out.

2057 2018-06-03 19:36:52 @LidlUK purchased the Parkside inverter generator the oil bottle was in the box but rest of toolkit was missing. I attempted to report this via your contact us webpage but you decided to reject the complaint claiming I’m a spam bot #notHappy

Me: hey, have you tried this stuff?
Cashier: yes. people say it's supposed to help with stress.
Me: did it work for you?
*cashier smiles calmly*
Cashier: I don't have stress.


2060 2018-06-03 19:36:25 Personally I think using house insurance is the way to go. So if you don't use qualified/certified companies or people to do gas/oil/plumbing/electrical etc work your insurance is void if there's issue caused by their work.
2061 2018-06-03 19:36:21 Well he’s bought KM so the Albertans can stop bitching and punsihing BC because sorry we don’t want our coastline filled with oil. FYI there was one hundred litres of oil that just spilled from Trans Mountain. And lots of Canadians love trump just not Harperites 
2062 2018-06-03 19:36:17 Found an old Pyrex dish I didn't know was in there. 

Yeah I don't think I let the oil get hot enough and perhaps wrong kind of oil?

2067 2018-06-03 19:35:51 Which might apply if we were talking about social housing which we’re not. Ask the folks in Lac-Mégantic about #NIMBYism where 47 people were killed in the middle of the night by an oil train fire, a train we are now spending 130M to reroute away from town! @MarcGarneau
2068 2018-06-03 19:35:48 It feels like a dream that we have crude oil in Kenya !!

If only...
2072 2018-06-03 19:35:06 Sarah Huckabee is everything that I wish you could be. Your open letter to her defiles her as only a huckster snake oil salesman can; which is not at all. As a husband and a father and human being How Dare You.
2073 2018-06-03 19:34:54 Oil is refined into petroleum and diesel in this country which EU country do we import oil from.
2074 2018-06-03 19:34:44 I remember hearing reports of oil companies storing their oil for times like this.  They are Viciously profiting.  Wish we could kick them to the curb with more electric cars
2075 2018-06-03 19:34:41 Said the CEO who hasn’t tried his own airline’s miserable basic economy product seats.  

Also, I am sure he will look to lower prices when oil prices fall, too.

2083 2018-06-03 19:33:07 Today I realised the biggest difference between being 23 and being 27.

23: "oh look I've got sunburn - yay! Someone pass me over that baby oil so I can get the part I've missed"

27: *arms get slightly warm* "someone pass me the factor 50 quickly, can't cope in this heat!"
2084 2018-06-03 19:33:03 How much money has PSU oil companies spent in acquiring stakes in Energy (oil) sector in Russia? Any nos? Where does that money come from? Let's talk numbers instead of ranting the "CON"gress line.
2085 2018-06-03 19:32:54 $ZN  I know nothing about this company . What I do know is that oil and gas cos that produce frequent drilling updates composed of excessive engineering gibberish are usually frauds , especially when they are serial equity issuers . @zerohedge @BrynneKKelly @AlderLaneeggs

2088 2018-06-03 19:32:19 Well, the oil industry in Iraq works anyway. Hard to imagine why, eh?  ('Journey in The Danger Zone - Iraq', BBC2).
2089 2018-06-03 19:32:17 I was living in Laurel, MD during the Oil Embargo in the fall of 1973. Working tunnel construction in Crystal City, VA. This 10-20 cents was nothing compared to that mess.
2090 2018-06-03 19:32:14 @CTVpolitics Both APC AND PDP failed Nigerians. PDP even failed Nigerians most cos durig their time Crude oil marketed well
2091 2018-06-03 19:32:04 If going w/ chicken, take shrooms/onions out of pan. Turn heat up, add more oil if needed, quickly brown the cubed chicken (or strips), let's say 2' per side. Then turn heat down to minimum, put lid on and don't open it for 10'. You're "steaming" the chicken.

2095 2018-06-03 19:31:42 how does chili oil pack so much heat in such small amounts
2096 2018-06-03 19:31:37 We have a railway line that would reduce the cost of transportation tremendously - Why are you obsessed with private enterprises that just loots our resources without getting value for investment.  The oil proceeds will be eaten by trucks and nothing left do the community & govt
2097 2018-06-03 19:31:35 My favourite one ever was a woman who brought in an oil painting that she was convinced was by Turner. Some expert had said so. The AR expert disagreed and said it was absolutely not a Turner. I thought she was going to hit him.

2100 2018-06-03 19:31:15 Ooook so I did something to the upper section of back so that's fun. So that's why we passed on the two night streams lately also been trying to learn how to edit videos and everything and there's only so many hours lol so been burning that midnight oil more than usual

2103 2018-06-03 19:30:34 Hi @greenandblacks, just noticed your Pralines have palm oil in them. Is it sustainably sourced and have you considered using any alternatives especially in light of your commitment to ethically sourced cocoa.
2104 2018-06-03 19:30:12 No surprise there.  FedEx was quick to hike fees when oil was rising before but didn’t cut rates when it fell....

2112 2018-06-03 19:29:35 Sounds a lot like North Dakota Tinder as well. Oil field boys and farmers who are all about those traditional gender roles.
2113 2018-06-03 19:29:23 only SWEET almond oil tho! try using it on your hair tips first. it conditions your hair so much. Huge vit E boost. Good luckKKK

2116 2018-06-03 19:29:08 We should be able to feed Canadians domestic oil and export as well....... we would need a refinery and be good to go.
2117 2018-06-03 19:29:05 are you suggesting people take shots of coconut oil i’m confused
2118 2018-06-03 19:29:01 I detest the man for what he is.  At best he's a poor businessman who gets by on bluster and balderdash...and by cheating. I think he is President only because he's a snake oil salesman. I believe that he sees the presidency as a piggy bank for himself and his kids.
2119 2018-06-03 19:28:52 Doing that legendary Castor Oil run, I see.
2120 2018-06-03 19:28:33 Chop onion/shallot, throw first in pan w/ butter, olive oil or coconut oil, then add mushrooms, don't cover, you want the shrooms' water to evaporate. In the meantime, quickly parboil the frozen veggies (or fresh ones) in salt water...
2121 2018-06-03 19:28:21 MMnn,,,Next time westminatsr ignores scotlands vote cos it suited them,and ,they could,
Scots should ask for the 300BILLION we have "pooled and shared" of our oil revenues.
Thats 92% leaving scots with 8% of their own oil
Disgusting Andrew
2122 2018-06-03 19:28:20 you learn a lot about people while sitting in the auto department at walmart waiting for an oil change
2123 2018-06-03 19:28:17 i highly recommend sweet almond oil as a body moisturizer. i have only used it in my hair twice and both times it fixed it drastically.

2127 2018-06-03 19:27:56 @seunokin @CTVpolitics @channelstv @APCNigeria neither  restored peace  in Niger delta nor increased crude oil production , they just restored it the way they met it in 2015.
2128 2018-06-03 19:27:50 This is your *first* oil? Dang, dude. This is amazing. I’m planning to do my first oil portrait at the end of this summer. This is amazing. Would never guess this is your first!

2131 2018-06-03 19:27:21 Nearly all Scotland’s known oil reserves are owned by non-Scottish companies; whisky industry is dominated by UK and overseas multinationals; salmon industry is dominated by Norwegian and Ukrainians and banking and financial sectors dominated by London and foreign entities.
2132 2018-06-03 19:27:11 You have evidently not been able to put down going to McDonald's.
This is part of the reason the economy is booming. We are no longer relying on the east to get oil. 
All this coming from a guy who doesn't have a car....
2133 2018-06-03 19:27:00 Sometimes it gets rid of what was deep in your skin, it will go away afterwards. I mix my moisturizer with tea tree oil, it usually does the trick.
2134 2018-06-03 19:26:52 All the couples in the oil change place and then there’s me 
2135 2018-06-03 19:26:39 Is that really the case though? As in, back in 2016, just probing of few individuals from the south led to oil facilities vandalisation.

Protein (no red meat): $10
Dairy (Yogurt, Milk; no cheese): $5
Misc (olive oil, spices, honey): $5
2142 2018-06-03 19:25:51 So about this @lizzo coconut oil EP y’all better get on it
2143 2018-06-03 19:25:50 I think there's something you're missing with the analogy. Do u mean fuel prices in GH drops when world crude oil price drop?? Crude dropped from $100 to $35 did it ever reflect in fuel price in GH? why r we affected by increment only?
2144 2018-06-03 19:25:34 Never put water in a pan with hot oil.  
Just burned tf outta my hand 
2145 2018-06-03 19:25:22 Also cut out all forms of sugar even fruit, cancer feeds on sugar. So just starve it by not feeding it. Add CBD oil, also eating a raw organic vegan diet helps. Look up the Gerson therapy treatment, many people find help and success with this treatment
2146 2018-06-03 19:25:17 Dejavu all over again... with a twist:

Back in the 70's, president Carter tried to implement these fuel standards but was thwarted by the Republicons and special (oil company) interests.

50 years later, the remaining but neutered goals are killed off by the same perpetrators.
2147 2018-06-03 19:25:16 Thanks! It's oil, right? I just don't want to waste money online with a site that's not reputable.
2148 2018-06-03 19:25:13 Please be on the lookout for looters in the oil sector. Its very prone due to the quick big money there.

2152 2018-06-03 19:24:16 I've been using coconut oil for almost a year for a lot of things but mainly I used it for taking off all my makeup cause your girl uses nothing but waterproof and longwear stuff cause of my oily skin and my watery eyes but omg I just can't use it anymore!
2153 2018-06-03 19:24:10 If the oil is so precious, why sell it? Leave it in the ground to keep Canada energy-independent for as long as the oil lasts. In the meantime, create long-term jobs in renewable technologies or other industries.

2156 2018-06-03 19:24:03 Yup it does seem like the most generous water sharing treaty with any lower riparian state anywhere in the world. Any revision to more equitable terms would mean Pakistan would turn into another Saudi Arabia - without the oil.

2160 2018-06-03 19:23:45 I learned that having a hydrating moisturizer and using oils help your face from overproducing oil.
2161 2018-06-03 19:23:37 If we can identify the artists and subject, maybe...as it stands, oil on canvas of a child, well painted, around €800-1500. More, once I've cleaned it and restored the frame.
2162 2018-06-03 19:23:33 Remember say Na those wey no necessarily lick the oil before them show you love valid pass.
2163 2018-06-03 19:23:24 Uh oh Looks like you need to get your oil checked again
2164 2018-06-03 19:23:23 Qatari regime has been using the oil to finance all terrorists in the region just to become an important contary in the gulf and Arab world regardless of thousands of victims.
2165 2018-06-03 19:23:19 HOT TAKE: Coconut oil is overrated.
2166 2018-06-03 19:23:14 Ethanol...the greatest boondoggle ever perpetrated on the US consumer. The rest of us gifting the American cornbelt. More expensive to produce; less miles per gallon. Crazy.
2167 2018-06-03 19:23:05 It's been a while since I told you all to slather yourself in scented oil like an ancient roman bather. Seriously, ya'll. It is divine. Love your skin, give it all the oil. Don't miss an inch of it.

2169 2018-06-03 19:22:46 I tend to follow Jamie's recipes, so pretty much all my food just tastes like a vat of olive oil.
2170 2018-06-03 19:22:42 What are you on?

Igbo ppl still farm.

Which ppl produce garri, palm oil, cocoa, locally made rice?
2171 2018-06-03 19:22:32 Nationalization is transforming private assets into public assets by bringing them under public ownership of national government. Government wants to obtain more revenues from oil for oil-producing countres' governments. A revenue making process.
2172 2018-06-03 19:22:26 The shitstorm carnival snake oil huckster you call a President does stupid things that affect my country Hoss.

2180 2018-06-03 19:21:26 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
2181 2018-06-03 19:21:18 Okay so t zone area! That means too much oil build up. Go with something very simple like CereVe cleanser for normal to oily skin. Then use witch hazel with rose or aloe extract :) the simpler, the better
2182 2018-06-03 19:21:17 Idea 208 : Frying pans with a container which can be used to store oil, then whenever you want to fry something, you put it on the pan, it figures out depending on the density and weight how much oil is needed.
2183 2018-06-03 19:20:58 My cousins 7yo is trying to buy an oil painting from me with the €3 he got for ice cream earlier. The look of panic in his dads face as he realises he may have to actually buy it to placate his kid is priceless*!
(*The painting, not so much!)
2184 2018-06-03 19:20:51 Misleading language, they mean Canada won’t be solely reliant on the US as an export market for its oil. But why we are exporting oil in the West and importing oil in the East makes no sense. The money would have been better spent on a refinery, or even better, not spent at all.
2185 2018-06-03 19:20:42 I was so sick of this server at work asking all the guys to check her oil I just went out and did it my fucking self
2186 2018-06-03 19:20:22 Nice!! Bet it feels great. I made some coffee oil too. So soothing.
2187 2018-06-03 19:20:19 its not positively historic but negative....u want to be like s.korea and singapore but u act in a funny way...why cant u refine the oil here ..

2191 2018-06-03 19:20:10 Awww my pleasure Marsha. Let me know if it works out for you. What you can also do is lightly coat the dough with oil, it will help getting it out of the container. I work in midtown by Rockefeller Center.
2192 2018-06-03 19:20:08 Please don't positively rationalize the high gas prices. People are robbing Paul to pay Peter while oil companies are robbing us.

2195 2018-06-03 19:19:45 I made a point recently to research our history with Iran. In 1953, the CIA sent Kermit Roosevelt there to overthrow democratically elected Mosedegh(sp) and reinstall the Shah, who was complicit in the theivery of 99% of oil profits by England, who cut us in for the favor. 1\
2196 2018-06-03 19:19:44 The shipping of 2,000 barrels a day is a pilot scheme to inform streamlining of logistics for major oil exports from 2021
2197 2018-06-03 19:19:33 Those Russian yachts just off the coast? They are you daddy now. The UK Govt sold you off for cheap oil and gas. Easiest way to solve border issue?  Have no border.

2200 2018-06-03 19:19:00 guess which dumbass spent almost 6 hrs wondering why her hair doesn't look completely dry yet and then realized the hair oil drops were supposed to be put on it BEFORE you wash it 
2201 2018-06-03 19:18:48 The snake oil salesman is not necessarily a scammer.
2202 2018-06-03 19:18:41 Part of his plan to "phase out" the oil sands.
2203 2018-06-03 19:18:35 It's because they had no oil.
Learn your history.
2204 2018-06-03 19:18:34 Their peak of mount vernon lubricated with lamp oil/kerosene twisted into their fish pocket
2205 2018-06-03 19:18:31 OMG cut off from the Euro oil wells.I seem to remember we had Allies in WW2.These brilliant free trading countries are our future.Europe has  been a nightmare for Britain for 5 centuries.
2206 2018-06-03 19:18:24 It's hilarious that ppl still can't recall that the fuel prices were lesser pre 2014 even when the crude oil prices were $ 115+. Modi & the @BJP4India Govt are fleecing the public & as usual we in general are moronic.
2207 2018-06-03 19:18:20 My list has @VillaCappelli on it. Or you can google UC Davis olive oil study to find out the few that pass their independent study each year.
2208 2018-06-03 19:18:15 Need to look up how canola oil compares to vege & olive oil but I have too much in stock to take account of anything that'll send me to get diff oil rn

2215 2018-06-03 19:17:30 I just went shopping and finally remembered to pick up another thing of coconut oil.  I've been missing it and its healthy, flavor-neutral profile.
2216 2018-06-03 19:17:25 "VINEGAR & OIL!  VINEGAR & OIL!"
2217 2018-06-03 19:17:19 Constuction is under control is what he said. The price is still 3 times more & oil is halfway to where it needs to be to justify it! Demand is reducing, and the 2x bills are still on the way. You misinterpreted or selectively misled yourself.....again!
2218 2018-06-03 19:17:15 My first game abroad was in The USA at a Citgo Oil Company golf day held at Don Shula’s Miami Lakes Country Club. Ladies from Hooters were on every hole offering alcoholic beverages..it was a texas scramble...it was the 1990s-what was I to do...we came 3rd #shameofit #fun #enjoy
2219 2018-06-03 19:17:07 Not sure what's in theirs but I use ground coffee, coconut oil and a bit of natural face cleanser
2220 2018-06-03 19:16:50 They sure love that fry oil
2221 2018-06-03 19:16:40 I am not a prophet of doom, but Kenya wasn't ready for oil, not just yet.

With scandals involving tax money, money from oil will suffer worse.

2223 2018-06-03 19:16:19 There hasn’t been a good intentions invasion since the Second World War. If the Middle East didn’t have oil and other riches we’d never know half about some countries as we du now.
Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and next stop Iran. A journey of failure.

2231 2018-06-03 19:15:29 @Cadillac I had an oil change and tire leak fixed yesterday at Suburban Cadillac dealership in Troy, MI & was driving home today and starting hearing a “chugging” sound - the lug nuts on two of my tires were so loose I could turn them with my hands!! This is complete negligence

2233 2018-06-03 19:14:57 Please tell me where the oil fields are in the EU. This is the most ridiculous Brexit story to date. Only remainers would take it serious. They put their heads in the sand, if you tell them house prices increased 300% under Blair & youth unemployment increased from 2004. Why
2234 2018-06-03 19:14:57 Stupid Oil lol
2235 2018-06-03 19:14:42 Well. So is castor oil but it has to be done.
2236 2018-06-03 19:14:29 And in Cruise of the Condor, Algy did it with a 2 gallon can of oil after an Immelmann turn!!

2238 2018-06-03 19:14:19 Record ever in TX is 120 F in June, 1994. Houston's records are 108 - 109 F in 2000, strangely enough in Sept., not June-July. Lots of Btu's from up above that required orders of magnitude more Btu's from down under to tame (like from underground Oil & Gas...)
2239 2018-06-03 19:14:19 I'm a big fan of the Beverly Hillbillies (for obvious reasons). But hey, weren't those folks from Texas?

2262 2018-06-03 19:12:01 Palm oil companies have illegally force entire villages from their ancestral land and also been found to use child and slave labour in plantations. @Tesco – stop contributing to these human rights abuses and ditch palm oil from your own brand products!
2263 2018-06-03 19:11:57 @RenHotels disappointed to see that your bathroom soaps contain Palm Oil Products - why do use products that contain the massively environmental damaging Palm Oil?

2265 2018-06-03 19:11:52 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

2270 2018-06-03 19:11:19 His lies to Americans.  Programs destroying the environment: not helping Flint with water, oil and gas leases, supporting fossil fuel use, hunting of threatened species for sport, parks etc are not being protected. His lack of ethics, insults to career employees etc.

2276 2018-06-03 19:10:44 It is an honour to be part of the historic moment. Especially being on the ground, with the issues that have been there since it's discovery in 2012. I can say so far the government and @TullowOilplc  have made a tremendous step. May the oil be a blessing to Kenyans! #Validdream
2277 2018-06-03 19:10:29 Hi Julia, currently around 93% of the total palm oil used in our own brand products comes from either a mass balance (25%) or segregated (68%) certified sustainable source. 1/3
2278 2018-06-03 19:10:28 Peat-based rainforests are one of the most essential tools in the fight against climate change as just one hectare can hold 6,000 tonnes of CO2 (10X more than normal soil!). @Tesco – ditch palm oil from your own brand products!
2279 2018-06-03 19:10:19 The palm oil part got me 
2280 2018-06-03 19:10:11 One thing I've always wanted to learn how to do is work on vehicles. I'm def not a mechanical guy. My dad wasn't, so in turn, I never learned.

I can confidently change the oil, but that's about it.

But, I might've taken a small step in that direction today

2287 2018-06-03 19:09:22 thank u mama- I hope ur sunburn gets better soon omg! a mixture tea tree oil, lavender essential oil, and coconut oil is what my sis uses for my nephew & it eases the pain and heals it within days!

2289 2018-06-03 19:09:17 I most certainly do. Hanging onto this “ you don’t understand” notion and yet, not defending your position on why YOU believe as you do, isn’t getting you or us any father in this discussion! Why do YOU think it makes sense to expand the oil patch to sell oil to Asia!

2295 2018-06-03 19:08:15 I sympathize with Turkana peoples. They have been marginalized by consecutive governments since independence. Oil could have been an equaliser, apparently the same people who denied resources & development to Turkana people are the one deciding what share they should get from oil
2296 2018-06-03 19:08:12 The decomposition point of Olive Oil is 220 degrees Celsius
2297 2018-06-03 19:07:54 The cost of oil was just cut in half. Lower prices will be at the pumps soon.
2298 2018-06-03 19:07:48 I'm saying that, how the oil money is to be used is clearly stated. If we so wish to change the laws,  we can but not to do it illegally. I have no problems with what government does with our money so long us it's legal.
2299 2018-06-03 19:07:42 Oooh Alicia love to cum oil that hot bod and have my way with you
2300 2018-06-03 19:07:37 That's very stupid of kenya exporting oil while we killed our own refinery......who is benefiting from all these? The high and mighty

2302 2018-06-03 19:07:21 I agree, the entire situation was TRUDEAU, he needed to step in , as any manager would when two employees are fighting. TRUDEAU in true PETER PAN fashion, prefers a different ending, an ending where the Government owned PIPELINE shuts down completely, out of the Oil Business.

Oil could have been an equaliser, apparently the same people who denied resources & development to Turkana people are the one deciding what share they should get from oil
2312 2018-06-03 19:06:02 Just because producers want to ship more and increase oil sands activity, certainly doesn’t justify the expansion. Not at the costs of doing this already, politically. The slim margin of difference and the risk to Metro Vancouver and BC’s sensitive marine ecosystem!
2313 2018-06-03 19:05:58 I could totally see a spot within an episode where Dean smiles and acts like a kid when it changes over to 0. Also I can see them groaning over needing new tires, oil changes, etc AGAIN. They take better care of her then themselves!

2315 2018-06-03 19:05:42 We currently have the highest oil, gas and resource production in our country's history. 

What are you talking about?
2316 2018-06-03 19:05:31 Closed back in 2004; onsite storage facilities converted to hold imported refined petroleum products:  enter Triton! An incomprehensible series of missteps, miscalculations and mistakes that have now resulted in early oil being exported to be refined elsewhere. Stupidity...
2317 2018-06-03 19:05:29 And you could work on it yourself! Loved that oil filter you could change by just opening the hood.
2318 2018-06-03 19:05:27 Palm oil beans and unsliced bread  remains undisputed for life 
2319 2018-06-03 19:05:26 .@IcelandFoods has promised to ditch palm oil from their own-brand products by the end of 2018. @Tesco – we know you can do this too! Do the right thing, ditch palm oil and help slow down the destruction.

2324 2018-06-03 19:04:36 I will continue to buy their oil soaked “organic ” products and continue to drive up their carbon footprint. They don’t care if we boycott l, but I will love exposing them when I buy a box of crap that they transported 100s of KMs to get to my store. 
2325 2018-06-03 19:04:32 Thats agood work Mr.president.Ithink the oil should now be a ladder to the people of turkana and kenya to improve the living standards of the people.Let not the hand of corruption touch the oil.
2326 2018-06-03 19:04:25 APC leaders are thieves. They are corrupt. The so called search for oil was a fraudulent scheme to embezzle funds. Thunder fire APC government and their leaders. We are not talking it easy anymore. Calamity Buhari and his gang of thieves and criminals must be kicked out in 2019.
2327 2018-06-03 19:04:21 Only because the enviroloons have made it impossible to ship Canadian oil to Canadian refineries.  I would prefer to buy Canadian oil made in a 'stoning women is ok' free refinery, wouldn't you?
2328 2018-06-03 19:04:18 If you support a national 55 mph speed limit (50 for trucks) I'll support you. We could cut emissions, gasoline prices, foreign oil imports, and reduce severity of traffic accidents.
2329 2018-06-03 19:04:12 Alaskans own 143,058 shares of BELLATRIX EXPLORATION LTD, worth $112,631. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.
2330 2018-06-03 19:04:11 The saddest part is the cartels killed the Coast based refinery, and now “export” crude oil so that we can “import” refined oil. What happens when people join GoK? Do they stop thinking rightly?
2331 2018-06-03 19:04:08 Sell oil and arms
2332 2018-06-03 19:04:07 also gregarious mammals like...primates...the kind of mammals, you know, humans are.  Can we change the phrase to "frog oil salesman" now?
2333 2018-06-03 19:04:01 Oh interesting, do you use essential oil as scent?
2334 2018-06-03 19:03:50 oil pizzas are the best mate
2335 2018-06-03 19:03:47 No but I can only use synthetic oil.
2336 2018-06-03 19:03:39 Waiting for the oil to heat up in the popcorn popper.
Being careful not to scratch a new record. Plus being able to read liner notes that were about a foot square.
Stretching the phone cord to the limits of its length.
The music skipping because you bounced  wearing your Walkman
2337 2018-06-03 19:03:33 I'm really sorry to hear this. It sound's like theyve got a plan in place.
Have you considered CBD oil?
2338 2018-06-03 19:03:30 Shaving your legs with baby oil is a game changer
2339 2018-06-03 19:03:11 Lego toppings > pizza bathed in oil.
2340 2018-06-03 19:03:05 The oil is too much ooo

Do you want to swim or bath??!!!
2341 2018-06-03 19:03:04 The banks want profit not production.  Be prepared for 15-20 percent  price increase until oil supplies increase.
2342 2018-06-03 19:02:53 Difference - current president, price hike driven by rising oil price. Previous president, oil price was low, and went down even further but petrol price was going in opposite direction.
2343 2018-06-03 19:02:53 You’re not supposed to be using the massage oil goofy ... not there ...  ... now I stepped off in it haven’t i ...  ...
2344 2018-06-03 19:02:34 I believe the opening of Turkana oil is not opening a looting point for CORRUPTION...
2345 2018-06-03 19:02:30 So, since Mr @phuthiseloba is in the custody for RAPE,does it mean that Fish Oil or Vaseline is currently taking its course..?
2346 2018-06-03 19:02:20 We don’t have enough oil.
2347 2018-06-03 19:02:18 Seems US shale oil missed the memo...it has now spent $280 billion more that it has earned chasing the dream of energy self sufficiency and whilst this has massively supported US in reducing imports the bill will still need to be paid when the music stops.
2348 2018-06-03 19:02:15 Such a strange tactic. 

Do they ever use electric cars?

Buy our oil, so we can drive over you since you banned guns.  

Then buy our oil again.
2349 2018-06-03 19:02:09 Changing oil, how to change a tire all of that stuff bro . Even to learning how to properly shave.  So many things young men missing out on to eventually have the knowledge to pass to their kids someday.
2350 2018-06-03 19:01:42 Goods to market at what expense? You already have a market just across your own border plus with Alaskan production on the decline and demand building regionally, there’s no need to sell oil to Asia half way around the planet at little more profit and at a great political cost!
2351 2018-06-03 19:01:36 Everything with him is a negotiation tactic. Logically it doesn't make sense that a guy who is in the real estate business would want to pay tariffs on something he buys a lot of. The rest of the world will call his bluff.  Hey we got oil, water, and hydro to bargain with.
2352 2018-06-03 19:01:34 Your wrong again. This country is about to become the highest producer of oil in the world. That means we can no longer be held captive by other countries. We have independence and will control price.
2353 2018-06-03 19:01:30 Four years ago, I went to my Fiancée(girlfriend at the time)’s house for the first time. I asked to see her oil paintings. She said, “oil paintings?” I said, “Every morning you send me an oil painting. I have them in my phone.” She laughed.

She was sending Android selfies. 
2354 2018-06-03 19:01:22 This white lace comforter and olive oil dense hair was a terrible mix. My lifestyle doesn’t match my aesthetic

2362 2018-06-03 19:00:39 Anytime now the world might be moving to clean energy, putting up refinery structures will take time and the oil might end up loosing it's market. There is rush for markets before going clean

2371 2018-06-03 18:59:48 Verified: Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft.
2372 2018-06-03 18:59:48 Remember when jimmy carter went on national tv and stated the world was about to run out of oil? Remember when Al Gore said that global warming and climate change would kill us all? That date has passed too. Liberals love to exaggerate with scare tactics.
2373 2018-06-03 18:59:44 What’s better? Cologne or oil?
2374 2018-06-03 18:59:42 I tried to take a multivitamin that had fish oil in it & it was so disgusting. It's in the toilet now. 
2375 2018-06-03 18:59:38 $75 for a fucking oil change 
2376 2018-06-03 18:59:37 Hahaha there is a lot “wrong” with me. I like it though, like “texture” in oil
2377 2018-06-03 18:59:35 aight. so i used so sugar, lemon juice, aloe vera juice(because i had weird what the fuck wounds on my knees from stuff), honey, and olive oil.
2378 2018-06-03 18:59:14 Man you should cover your mug. No oil painting.

2381 2018-06-03 18:58:50 I hope it wont be a curse like nigeria where they produce oil for export yet they que to buy the product at petrol stations.@ahmednassirlaw
2382 2018-06-03 18:58:40 Since we don't buy Saudi oil that comment makes no sense.
2383 2018-06-03 18:58:36 SC speaking as a petroleum engineer en hving seen oilfields b4..
We are where oil producing countries were in 1970s.
Nothing to be proud of
2384 2018-06-03 18:58:36 面積分は流束を、線積分は循環を、それぞれ微小部分の寄与を足しあげてるという考えが大事です
2385 2018-06-03 18:58:35 You reap what you sow Theresa. I just wish you grew a set of balls and call this continuing tsunami of terrorism what it is and deport, jail and refuse entry. Olive oil and balsamic vinegar doesn’t mix. You are destroying the island that was, once, great.
2386 2018-06-03 18:58:32 There is no such thing as sustainable palm oil.  The only decent thing to do is avoid it altogether.
2387 2018-06-03 18:58:23 No The price ya the marijuana oil is over R1000 has me very confused. I feel you Sema. Hope the Lavender helps. I'm trying absolutely everything lately. I'm a zombie
2388 2018-06-03 18:58:19 Looking for more baby oil???
2389 2018-06-03 18:58:14 There should just be fountains of an inflammable oil squirting out of the top, over the razor blades.
2390 2018-06-03 18:57:36 Looks like there needs to be an oil embargo...on Trump's hair
2391 2018-06-03 18:57:35 Everyone I speak to seems to be shouting about cannabis oil lately.  Seems half the pensioners are on it.
2392 2018-06-03 18:57:26 Interesting, I'm about 130% :/.. obviously it's not accurate and some of it will be a necessary evil based on where I live; the only option to heat the house is oil without spending £20k+ I don't have, likewise car is the only viable travel option. Those in cities will do better.
2393 2018-06-03 18:57:17 Principles and Pickles are kind of like oil and water
2394 2018-06-03 18:57:16 The Jubilee government is forcing importers to use the SGR to transport cargo but would rather use the road to transport oil
2395 2018-06-03 18:57:14 Go sell your snake oil somewhere else.
2396 2018-06-03 18:57:14 They are waiting for the highest bidders, people with oil money 
2397 2018-06-03 18:57:04 Diet Tip: Eat Plenty of Smart Fat. 

The best fats to include in your diet are Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Grass-fed Butter, Avocados, and Omega-3's.  Plus fat from healthy animals.  FYI, never cook with liquid fats.
2398 2018-06-03 18:57:02 Vaping, as in the traditional form, as it was developed, no. If you're talking about the NEW cannabis cartridges? It definitely delivers a high concentration of THC, but doesn't deliver the oil to treat seizures. By all acounts, I'm not to smoke cannabis while on meds I'm on.
2399 2018-06-03 18:56:57 had me one of them K&N oil filters so removing would be easy....that nut just rounded stright off -_-

2407 2018-06-03 18:55:23 The perfect @jennyashman is in Italy for two weeks and is texting me ONLY pictures of pasta she is eating and also oil paintings of Judith decapitating Holofernes with the hashtag “Times Up” because she is a best friend who knows me so so so well.
2408 2018-06-03 18:55:16 I use baby oil too.
2409 2018-06-03 18:55:08 Oh, I don't mean to sound smart, but start with the easy things first, make sure your oil isn't low

2414 2018-06-03 18:54:39 If anyone ever drops grease, oil, alcohol or cigarettes on my Indian stone again I’m gonna sue their ass
2415 2018-06-03 18:54:31 Don't be disingenuous, your product isn't able to be grown, produced, packaged or shipped without the Oil and Gas industry. Will be boycotting your products.
2416 2018-06-03 18:54:27 Thirdly, there is NO "misguided narrative that we must choose between protecting the environment and growing the economy." That has never been an issue and in point of fact, renewable energy jobs have been growing faster than coil and oil.

2419 2018-06-03 18:54:13 The bread and oil thing happened to me at a Turkish Restaurant here in Wales. We never went back, so they lost customers for the sake of a couple of quid !
2420 2018-06-03 18:53:43 Baby oil apparently, or if you got like coconut oil or something it should break it down a bit
2421 2018-06-03 18:53:41 The REAL dangers to our national security is the use of oil, & the trade with those who hate Freedom. It's the absurd war on drugs that makes insane & evil people have armies & the inability to disagree without animosity. It's the worship of money & the eroding of Democracy.
2422 2018-06-03 18:53:34 Dyinnn..someone said you want to fight men that were fed cocoa yam and palm oil from six months old..you gon learn today
2423 2018-06-03 18:53:13 All of this isolation tactic to give Russia a prominent roll.. Israel already aligning with Russia on middle east talks and Saudi colluding with Russia on opec prices ! When oil price is controlled to be high, Russia wins !  Putin moving the chips thru trump !
2424 2018-06-03 18:53:12 They're just quenching the urge to be classified as an oil exporting Nation. At core of offshore oil infrastructure is pipeline development
2425 2018-06-03 18:52:51 According to me we should bring back to life the Mombasa Oil Refinary,process our crude oil and sell the final product.

2443 2018-06-03 18:50:58 Production Sharing Agreements on oil, gas, nuclear power are always shrouded on secrecy and we'll guarded. They are only available after 25 years post production
2444 2018-06-03 18:50:46 It can be viewed in that capacity yes. However, with regards to specific things, such as Seizures? Just smoking the plant won't & isn't a fix. I know from experience. CBD oil is the necessary ingredient. The normal amounts of THC is good for anxiety & other things.
2445 2018-06-03 18:50:40 You can do that with any snake, just dip in in used engine oil, and spray it with a hose pipe.

Lazy. Sad.
2446 2018-06-03 18:50:37 I've read similar things. What we have today is a small number of young people making noise, not votes. Also, young people are by no means all demos,  especially in local elections.

2448 2018-06-03 18:50:30 No way...unless the cartels have already infiltrated that sector.Changamwe plant used to refine imported crude oil
2449 2018-06-03 18:50:26 I’m sure that you would. If Westminster hadn’t squandered all the North Sea oil all the home nations would be in better positions. I wish Scotland every success if she ever votes the break up the union. To want you to fail would be churlish. As long as you still let me visit?

2457 2018-06-03 18:49:39 Govt regulations cut... and how is this good? Because of this, we will have more air and water pollution, oil rigs are more dangerous, etc... profits over people.

Constitutional circuit judges appointed... so? Even Neil Gorsuch is now going against Trump. 
2458 2018-06-03 18:49:17 Yes, that's the problem. And other teams have been built that way for a number of years & haven't tried to migrate.

2469 2018-06-03 18:47:38 Wow.anyone but Secretary Perry tout this meeting? I disagree with Sec Perry a lot but he had advocated for micro energy,wind, solar in the past?  More hydro power in AK? So damup more nature. Sad. Oil and gas is what’s causing the receding sea ice Murkowski. You know this
2470 2018-06-03 18:47:36 Apologies wrote rubbish the first tweet, now deleted! South Sudan is one of Africa’s largest producers of oil, it seems to me civil war  is fuelled by oil prices and revenue. People are always the cost when such large revenues are at stake. #southsudan
2471 2018-06-03 18:47:30 will we be exporting oil and at the same time importing????... Mbona sielewi name hii story.. — Thinking loud
2472 2018-06-03 18:47:24 Yes be careful. Free speech police & the triads. I didn't realise we are watching the steady destruction of our society because our Gov had 2 accept it as a condition of maintaining a steady supply of oil. I suspect the cost 2 our society will be far greater in lives let alone £.
2473 2018-06-03 18:47:23 The low smoke point of olive oil is actually a myth. You can cook with it at higher temperatures. However, it comes down to taste as well. Olive oil has strong flavour, corn is more neutral tasting. Soybean oil is higher in sat fat than corn oil. Canola also has a neutral taste!
2474 2018-06-03 18:47:17 Coconut oil
2475 2018-06-03 18:47:13 So, for us, the concept of self-determination is working pretty well, even though the rest of the state can't get it's act together due to it's slavish worship of a Jesus that bubbles up as crude oil and demands that the different must be punished / ostracized
2476 2018-06-03 18:47:10 Oomf I got his shade alright, I'm going to give him a new oil exchange b/c I'm feeling good today.

2478 2018-06-03 18:46:56 CBD Oil is a miracle.
2479 2018-06-03 18:46:56 So the USA relies on Canada for its lumber, oil, water, electricity and according to many of your auto makers, our steel and aluminum. Yet somehow in your mind Canada is stealing your resources?? Time to wake up and start looking at the facts/
2480 2018-06-03 18:46:48 Omg I just took a full dropper of ear oil !!!! It looks similar to the FOL bottle  am gonna die ? Lmao  ing. Distilled water olive oil , vitamin D tastes ok idk what else 
2481 2018-06-03 18:46:42 Absolutely! It is important to try to wash the oil off with soap and water as soon as it comes in contact with the skin. The oil can be transferred from clothes, backpacks, etc. several months after exposure as well.
2482 2018-06-03 18:46:39 oil oil oil on the road... WE’RE GONA CRASH
2483 2018-06-03 18:46:17 He smiles lovingly, pressing a kiss to Matthew's lips and goes to the bathroom to set up the bath. A sandalwood oil bath would help with his headache very much.
2484 2018-06-03 18:46:13 Sweet Sunday: Corn on the cobb. Grilled on an open fire w/a pork roast thinly sliced garlic, marinated w/olive oil fresh herbs,spices, pears, apples all blended together in some yummy goodness.

2489 2018-06-03 18:45:42 Ontario and the rest of Canada has been treading water going nowhere  for years - the second largest landmass in the world with huge minerals, forestry, agricultural and oil wealth *stagnating* due to INEPT GOVT and external activist interference

2492 2018-06-03 18:45:04 Hopefully the next bengals stadium is like Lucas oil stadium so we can host an NCAA regional or final 4. They should have a convention center attached to bring in more revenue
2493 2018-06-03 18:45:03 the locals on the beach this weekend put on a pound of tanning oil and lit up a cig under their towel so the wind wouldn’t put out their light
2494 2018-06-03 18:44:58 Try a nice beard oil! It will help you during the itchy phase
2495 2018-06-03 18:44:56 I am a 7th generation CA. My grandfathers name was in the old sidewalks down by J and I Magnins. He built the oil docks in Oakland; the San Rafael, Richmond Bay and San Mateo bridges. My great Aunt was the first female DA for the state.  They would be horrified at condition CA.
2496 2018-06-03 18:44:55 Arab oil ministers stress need for continued OPEC, non-OPEC cooperation: RIYADH (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC Arab oil ministers stressed the need for continued cooperation between oil producers who are part of a pact for a global supply cut that is due to expire at the end of…
2497 2018-06-03 18:44:54 It is, I try hard to eliminate palm, & I’d rather have butter than palm (or any oil) in bakery items but can’t give them those. Also discovering how much milk creeps into unexpected things - found out there’s dried milk in some crisps!!
2498 2018-06-03 18:44:51 Kenya officially joins the world oil producing nations and w will be attending the next summit for these nations. Fisayo Akande Habila Ayakpat Ola Oladimeji kindly advise of the venue and the date

2501 2018-06-03 18:44:43 Yeah and scrub for a couple of mins, repeat once a week, should see a difference. Almond oil is also good for reducing dark areas
2502 2018-06-03 18:44:38 The most hated sentence in my book “ Ray can you do me a favor? “ ... fck no! It’s never “ can you rub oil on my back” ! #foodservice
2503 2018-06-03 18:44:36 Perfume oils are oil fragrances used in making perfume.... they smell exactly even better than perfumes.. they last longer too because they are concentrated.
2504 2018-06-03 18:44:34 Talking to a random dude at the oil change place about weed because he dropped his grinder and spilled his weed on the floor
2505 2018-06-03 18:44:31 EU major problem is OIL. SOLUTION....Recognize Hebrew Biafra and negotiate oil or continue Biafra GENOCIDE for oil and Syria war for oil pipelines to Europe. Italy is awake...thanks to the MOST HIGH.
2506 2018-06-03 18:44:10 This is so brilliant. 

After stagnant wages for a decade it is so heartening for everyone. 

Especially if we can be oil independent in a few yrs.
2507 2018-06-03 18:44:04 I guess today's as good a day as any to check my oil. I don't think I've checked it since j20
2508 2018-06-03 18:44:02 Oh I know the chances the oil drafting him are slim and honestly I am hoping for bode Wilde as he seems like a perfect fit and in acouple years he could be a beast on the Blueline.
2509 2018-06-03 18:43:53 I swear, there are people so skeptical of any educated person, viewing them as cunning and slick, they can't detect the clumsy snake oil salesman right in front of them.
2510 2018-06-03 18:43:50 Please tell me more about this lavender oil, I suffer from terrible insomnia 
2511 2018-06-03 18:43:37 So shrinking our national parks, loosing clean water restrictions, off-shore oil drilling in protected seas. Trump also hates wind turbines. That whole net neutrality thing. Where are these breakthroughs? All I see are set backs.
2512 2018-06-03 18:43:36 Why exporting and where to....changamwe oil refinery is there....mbn wasifufu na tuanze kusafisha wenyewe...let's the oil refined here in kenya and used locally.
2513 2018-06-03 18:43:36 I often wonder whether my chest is full of rusty nails and engine oil.
2514 2018-06-03 18:43:36 Alaskans own 12,156 shares of NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY PARTNERS, worth $59,976. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in CANADA.
2515 2018-06-03 18:43:03 Just use more oil my butt is hurting
2516 2018-06-03 18:42:57 Gun Oil ™ is an excellent product
2517 2018-06-03 18:42:53 He'll put a fingerprint lock on the landing craft and only realize he has to take off his glove to open it after he lands.
2518 2018-06-03 18:42:40 Robert - have you watched any of Florida Marqui’s YT videos, recent ones re Caribbean, Venezuela, Russian & US ships?  Has a lot to do with big US oil co’s, etc.
2519 2018-06-03 18:42:40 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
2520 2018-06-03 18:42:35 Clearly sexist Bernie Bros will cause mass extinction. We can't blame it on extreme destruction of forrests, mountain blasting, oil burning, colonization of sensitive environments, or, u know, anything else..
2521 2018-06-03 18:42:27 what's perfume oil for sef? Is it a type of perfume or what? 
2522 2018-06-03 18:42:13 Also consider Kenya having a morden oil refinery to ensure we don't export crude and then import more expensively. Just a thought
2523 2018-06-03 18:42:07 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
2524 2018-06-03 18:42:07 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2525 2018-06-03 18:42:03 If you mean "cooks with lard instead of vegetable oil", yes we do, git tae feck. :D
2526 2018-06-03 18:41:58 So now lorries will passing each other as some import and others take oil for export? #crudeoilinkenya

2528 2018-06-03 18:41:19 Could be a promising year in Bakersfield as finally the oil are getting better at developing their players, I will be watching Lagesson eagerly
2529 2018-06-03 18:41:18 If he has the technology to go to Mars, you'd think a smart gun would be a lunch time project!
2530 2018-06-03 18:41:16 We have our own oil and our own farms. I think a trade war wont be the end of the world. It might actually work out really well and bring some industry back to America #MAGA
2531 2018-06-03 18:41:12 Honestly I feel like this will force Canada to diversify our exports, thereby reducing risk, while the cost will be largely absorbed by US business. If the US escalates, we can stop selling oil. I'll be stocking up on bourbon however.
2532 2018-06-03 18:41:09 Peppermint oil around your edges.

Your welcome.
2533 2018-06-03 18:41:03 So infrastructure is more expensive. Also most petroleum is actually processed in Singapore and imported rather than having someone refineries. Ironically oz exports a lot of oil, but it is the wrong grade for turning into petroleum. It's is too high quality.
2534 2018-06-03 18:40:56 @proud48percent @nickreeves9876 The greasy opportunist will be off to find some other gullible people to sell snake oil to.

2536 2018-06-03 18:40:43 When in doubt, olive oil is your friend
2537 2018-06-03 18:40:27 Somebody tell them we have oil and they'll be right over
2538 2018-06-03 18:40:25 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
2539 2018-06-03 18:40:18 Bonkers isn't it. I buy palm oil free everything, but it certainly limits choice! And yet there are so many perfectly good alternatives.
2540 2018-06-03 18:40:10 Beard oil/balm recommendations?
2541 2018-06-03 18:40:09 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
2542 2018-06-03 18:40:07 @PetroleumMin it's okay if the prices of petrol and diesel is higher due to high taxes imposed but I hope that the collection would help government to repay old Debts from other countries to buy oil when they provided Subsidies @PMOIndia @narendramodi
2543 2018-06-03 18:39:59 how do Italians get a party started? shots of olive oil

2547 2018-06-03 18:39:47 So, kalau rara start jual minyak kelapa atau nama omputihnya virgin coconut oil ada orang nak beli tak? Homemade with love from langkawi.
2548 2018-06-03 18:39:42 Ononmorrow evening straight after work I'm going to drain the oil on the Striple and let it do so overnight
2549 2018-06-03 18:39:42 Relatively cheap to run! Oil and filter once a year, serviceables are relatively cheap. cambelt every 5 years at approx 1k is the only biggie. Real cost prob around 1-1.5k a year, inc insurance & tax.

2553 2018-06-03 18:39:29 Depends on the day. I do take a full dropper daily (usually when I break my fast because of the MCT oil) and more if needed. The roll-ons are great for the "as needed" stuff, and for specific purposes. I REALLY love meditating while using the Solace roll on. Super soothing.
2554 2018-06-03 18:39:01 I think Tkachuk will go earlier then he's predicted and that just means the oil may get a shot a one of the top 9 players but either way I will be happy the oil aren't trading the pick.
2555 2018-06-03 18:38:58 "Sandalwood or peppermint oil bath, love? I can get one ready for you."
2556 2018-06-03 18:38:55 Rub that cuticle oil on my ass
2557 2018-06-03 18:38:48 Early Oil programme will only benefit transporters and Tallow.
Today's crude price $ 65.
150 barrels per truck × $65 × 100 Bob - transport costs of 400,000 = a balance of about Ksh 575,000 for Tallow.
2558 2018-06-03 18:38:40 Those thinking  of cheaper gas prices now that we are producing oil,  let me tell you some, you are California dreaming.
2559 2018-06-03 18:38:39 For soup, cook ground garlic in oil, then simmer with pork, dill, vegetable broth and peas. Top with tarragon.
2560 2018-06-03 18:38:22 I’ve friends who’ve gone full vegan & trying to buy ‘vegan’ processed food that’s palm oil free is almost impossible. I expected vegan products to use rape/sunflower as oil/fat of choice! Not use palm oil as destroying animal habitat!
2561 2018-06-03 18:38:22 I will never forget that one blue zip tie from the mineral oil build
2562 2018-06-03 18:38:20 Again, who is preventing you from making a smart gun?
2563 2018-06-03 18:38:20 They might. For a while. If it's underwater it's underwater. They're more likely to want a bailout than to cary on in a bear oil market.
2564 2018-06-03 18:38:13 That's why all the polls show the demos being set up for a big failure in November. Love to see your tweets from before the last Pres election.
2565 2018-06-03 18:38:12 Maasai Mara rakes in about ksh3-4billion yearly. 19% is set aside for the communities. BUT man, nothing gets to them. Narok is among the POOREST. Narok Governor has been accused of LOOTING. Turkana, once the oil was flagged to Mombasa, forget it. It has gone with the money
2566 2018-06-03 18:38:11 You right  excuse me is a go buy ORGANIC potatoes and ORGANIC vegetable oil 
2567 2018-06-03 18:38:11 *smells of  oil and cocoa butter* 
2568 2018-06-03 18:38:05 yeehaw america, walmart, inbred, ford, trump, farm, family dinner, school shootings, freedom, oil, obesity, football & guns 
2569 2018-06-03 18:37:56 So as you can see, the £17.5bn from Scottish oil sales is a very small part of overall GDP.
2570 2018-06-03 18:37:51 Hi doc  so is that you releasing pythons into the Everglades?Don't fuss over Canada. We are net minus producer of CO2. Focus on China India USA instead. What is that tarsand thing you reference. Tar doesn't exist in nature. It is a byproduct of mainly  coal and small bit from oil
2571 2018-06-03 18:37:46 Honestly I have 30 in my ears and I've never had an issue, warm water and tea tree oil twice a day untill the swelling goes down then warm salt water for a few weeks helps them heal fine
2572 2018-06-03 18:37:38 I'm sure @SeanPaige @MichaelCLFields and the rest of the Oil & Gas Daddy hacks in @coloGOP will chime in soon about how government shouldn't pick winners and losers and how subsidizing energy producers violates their firm principles. #copolitics #coleg
2573 2018-06-03 18:37:32 I always smell like some type of coconut product oil or butter 
2574 2018-06-03 18:37:29 Drinking castor oil will help

2576 2018-06-03 18:37:16 Like a pervert on a crowded bus
A glare of love bears down on us
Like a carcass left out in the heat
This love is bursting out of me
Like an oil tanker tipped at sea
This love's contaminated me
Like a constant twitching in my eye
This love of ours will never die
2577 2018-06-03 18:37:12 Just how many barrels are needed to fill one oil tanker for export? @UKenyatta
2578 2018-06-03 18:37:08 Hate getting a oil change feel like I been here for years
2579 2018-06-03 18:37:08 Girls does the coconut oil make the scalp itchy vele? 1st time user I've Been scratching myself all day @GirlTalkZA
2580 2018-06-03 18:37:01 Please do keep trying to educate somebody who has medcial cards in past, somebody who has been addicted to pills and kicked them. You can get the medical use from A) oil/edibles B) you can still smoke said weed from medcial shops. Oil is ur CBD which is for pain.
2581 2018-06-03 18:36:44 .@tesco Unsustainable palm oil is one of the most environmentally damaging industries in the world, and you use over 40,000 tonnes of the stuff each year! This cannot be sustained so please ditch it!
2582 2018-06-03 18:36:41 Coconut oil, coffee, and bicarbonate should do the trick
2583 2018-06-03 18:36:21 Argan oil works well
2584 2018-06-03 18:36:20 Absolutely stop “Veg Oils” today Olive Oil Butter Bacon grease beef tallow green light. If you want to understand why no Veg Oils ...
all the way down to the molecular level ... Follow Tucker 
2585 2018-06-03 18:36:20 The Earth is expanding.
The weakening magnetic shield is fucking everything up.
i'm pretty sure we've extracted way too much oil
and the more the Sun freaks out
the more furiously they play wack a mole 
and when shit gets worse they point at me
and say "it's thor's fault"
2586 2018-06-03 18:35:57 You like the guy? He's a product of nepotism who's never done an oil deal in his life. Grew daddy's high margin consulting business in a bull market with a pile of money. WAY out of his depth here.
2587 2018-06-03 18:35:56 Wow so much hate for Canada in this thread. Please build a wall along Canada as well, keep you arrogant asses from coming in and keep the water, oil and electricity we sell to you at a ridiculously discounted price to ourselves.
2588 2018-06-03 18:35:52 Discovered a recipe today for cake in a cup.

2589 2018-06-03 18:35:49 It’s clear. No smart guns on @NRA’s watch...sales would decline by double digits if stolen guns couldn’t be fired.

2590 2018-06-03 18:35:30 Once your personal experience has taken its course: the whole thing could burst into oil clouds, for the all of me. Fuck you
2591 2018-06-03 18:35:30 I need some oil for my waist today is already the 3rd
2592 2018-06-03 18:35:24 What was UPA's oil deal ? Can you explain and then we can engage on a discussion
2593 2018-06-03 18:35:13 Sunday funday shots are 450tk offline!   Let's get to a drunk oil show tonight  topless in 5 shots 
2594 2018-06-03 18:35:04 I never get out, so part of me is like, go them for just living life, being out, pubs are a nightmare up here when the Sun is out, its like walking dead but they are drunk Scottish oil workers and their angry wives
2595 2018-06-03 18:34:53 That reminds me, I forgot to oil and glitter my chest.
2596 2018-06-03 18:34:49 And stop nexen from having us make up shortfalls on any money they lose on their oil. That’s a conservative deal. Real deal makers. Lost 3 billion on the automakers in 2009. #dontvoteconservative #ScheerIncompetence #scheerstupidity
2597 2018-06-03 18:34:48 The purpul hair shampoo and hair oil did wonders for me. No more dandruff/ itching
2598 2018-06-03 18:34:42 Mandatory restocking with criminal penalties for failure. Most FFLs are either small shops or transactional dealers. Stocking an unsalable $3000 product is an undue, unfair burden.
2599 2018-06-03 18:34:08 Americans along with others should probably mind their own business too, they wouldn't be near the sand if there wasn't oil there.
2600 2018-06-03 18:34:01 They will to pay their costs the same way shale producers carried on in the low price environment before they drove their costs down - which, by the way, the oil sands operators have had considerable success in doing.
2601 2018-06-03 18:34:00 Love #argan oil? Remember that it's only made in #Morocco. If it comes from another country, it's probably not the real thing.
2602 2018-06-03 18:33:56 The Environment is a Leftist. Soros is paying it to make the Right look bad.
It's time we put the CFC's back in Hairspray and took the bitch to task.
Also proposing competitions for the best Fracking earthquakes by our friends in the oil biz. Vote Plunder, it's Freedom Baby!
2603 2018-06-03 18:33:55 Okei, but norway has a oil fond that has over 100 billion dollars in it. I dont think ur artikle thinkd of that. But i can agree that germany is rich aswell.
2604 2018-06-03 18:33:51 I could pour a whole bottle of oil serums on my hair and it would still be dry as hay
2605 2018-06-03 18:33:44 Tbh, value of rupee in dollars is not much of an issue. Big success is that now India is bypassing US currency in oil imports from Iran. Let us not over estimate the value of US dollars.

2607 2018-06-03 18:33:13 Awww! Someone upset that their proxies(ISIS, Al-nusra, Al-Qaeda) are screwed up badly in Syria & Iraq. Plan to capture oil reservoirs are scattered.
Sorry for the loss 
2608 2018-06-03 18:33:07 Can a smart gun be transferred? Be careful how you answer this.
2609 2018-06-03 18:32:51 I need to go to the store for some olive oil
2610 2018-06-03 18:32:50 Exactly right!  I took oil & gas law one semester... No real reason... seemed interesting... maybe it was Beverly Hill Bellies influence... was cool, and I remember stuff from that class more than most!
2611 2018-06-03 18:32:46 Regular Busch was my unemployment beer in 1998-99 when I got laid off in the oil field.  Coors Light is the most watered down beer I ever actually drank.
2612 2018-06-03 18:32:39 Question is; will that oil reach Mombasa with “looters” loitering all over.
2613 2018-06-03 18:32:22 .@IcelandFoods has promised to ditch palm oil from their own-brand products by the end of 2018. @Tesco – we know you can do this too! Do the right thing, ditch palm oil and help slow down the destruction.
2614 2018-06-03 18:32:12 But in typical #gunsense fashion, I expect Dennis to say that because NJ didn't submit to the latest demand of anti-rights people, the state is in the pocket of the NRA.
2615 2018-06-03 18:32:08 Absolutely, she's screwing us now on mag limits, they hot 15, in 1990 now it's going to be 10. Never trust New Jersey politicians.
2616 2018-06-03 18:31:54 A girl said she uses Olive oil on her lips every morning, in d evening she uses Shea butter on her lips b4 she sleeps and puts her lips in d mouth of bottles 2 suck it that she wants to hav pouted lips

I asked if it's her lips d angels would use 2 blow trumpet on judgment day
2617 2018-06-03 18:31:40 @UKenyatta  Why export oil while were importing it too?  Let's have #zero import of oil then export surplus this is the only way out otherwise the idea of exporting must have a backup of #bigfish maximise Kenyans utility for economic boost
2618 2018-06-03 18:31:22 Hahahahaha. A single gun. And if it is as unwanted as you say, there is no restocking.

The @NRA is a terrorist organization, facilitating pass-through gun sales to criminals.
2619 2018-06-03 18:31:08 I’ve been a black coffee drinker my whole life but now will occasionally do a fat-added coffee to help some days. Also found some avocado oil based mayonnaise that I like, and which can be added to veggies or meat as a dip or something.
2620 2018-06-03 18:30:48 Or you could have a dream about drowning in oil!
2621 2018-06-03 18:30:46 I guess it's because we've run out of other logical fallacies? I mean, the current administration has been going through them at an alarming rate. We'll run out of those before we run out of oil, probably.
2622 2018-06-03 18:30:38 Value addition isn't even being considered. Transporting crude oil for export doesn't make sense. What happened to our oil refinery?
2623 2018-06-03 18:30:33 Well isn't that just precious.

What I mean is that right now, Donald Trump and Theresa May wholeheartedly support Saudi Arabia, a tyrannical oil monarchy. Past alliances and interventions are too many to count.

I ignored your "minorities" question because I don't understand it.

2627 2018-06-03 18:29:56 When Dani washes away the homeowners rick Simpson oil  because she’s trying to be helpful 
2628 2018-06-03 18:29:40 Plus this isn’t normal oil being pulled out of the ground, it’s tar sands which is incredibly bad for the enviro & bitumen which we know so little about we don’t even know if the bitumen will sink or float when there is a spill in the ocean (ie if it’s even possible to clean up)
2629 2018-06-03 18:29:28 so, my suggestion would be to use an oil cleanser to take off makeup. a normal, low-ph cleanser. some type of BHA product (helps with oil). and gel moisturizer (nothing too heavy).

i like a lot of asian skincare, so i kinda stick to their methodology of layering products.
2630 2018-06-03 18:29:27 why export crude oil when we have a refinery at Mombasa??
2631 2018-06-03 18:29:27 My new associate used to work at Sprouts & told me they have a strawberry flavored fish oil so you get strawberry flavored burps & now I’m real curious.
2632 2018-06-03 18:29:08 2/2 This was viewed as a backdoor way of forcing this on the public and eventually mandating it anyway. The Bill's author was the same as the original bill, and she is well known as a vehement anti gun person, not to be trusted.
2633 2018-06-03 18:29:06 WHY , again , are we exporting oil ?
2634 2018-06-03 18:29:00 Are we exporting crude oil, then import refined oil products?
2635 2018-06-03 18:28:55 That's a good enough reason to veto.
2636 2018-06-03 18:28:53 Phew, I watched how they make baby oil once, it's worse than sausage
2637 2018-06-03 18:28:48 飯食ってなかったし夕食食べに行かねば
2638 2018-06-03 18:28:44 The first place to look is going to be the 90s oil glut, & I will, but this is a different sitch. The sands are high cost, active ops. Think on it: Suncor & Cenovus just going to operate at a negative margin cuz they got a pipe to fill?
2639 2018-06-03 18:28:40 #FakeFrenchFriesFacts Napoleon abandoned the seige of Moscow after the French fry oil froze over.
2640 2018-06-03 18:28:18 After hearing @Sequisha talk about using coconut oil for his stache I finally made the switch and I'm never looking back. Plus, you can smell like coconuts all day.
2641 2018-06-03 18:28:17 From the guy who supported tax cuts so the oil friends of his buddy, Harper, could make more cash.
2642 2018-06-03 18:28:07 It’s actually very good, but one thing with it, if you’re using it, it’s better you use all the products together, the hair conditioner, hair cream, hair oil and all
2643 2018-06-03 18:28:00 If you do not eat Greek food often, the lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil combo used as a flavor agent on stuffed grape leaves is refreshing.  It reminds  me of the tamarind used in Filipino food.
2644 2018-06-03 18:28:00 High horse? Just stating fact. Are you anti US? You need to understand something. The world market runs off off something called the Petro Dollar. No oil moves anywhere without it. And guess who runs the Petro Dollar, the US. Do some research.
2645 2018-06-03 18:27:59 Well not oil but there are plenty of forward thinking industries. Oil is archaic technology & we don’t need it. We have the land/resources to produce as much energy we can export from better sources: Wind, Solar, Salt Water, Hydro. Becoming a world leader in new technologies 
2646 2018-06-03 18:27:57 So my question is. Do you drive a golf cart for your personal vehicle. I don’t care if my truck get 10 MPG. Moe gas it burns, the more oil needs refining the more jobs people have to keep the pump a pumping!!

2656 2018-06-03 18:26:44 Sure. Finely chop herbs (parsley, thyme, rosemary) and garlic. Mix with butter. Loosen skin and place herb butter between skin and breast/legs. Rub chicken with olive oil.

Of course, if real costs of obtaining /maintaining our oil supply were honestly calculated, gas was never cheap. But we love our societal lies.

2674 2018-06-03 18:24:51 Before we export we should  be able to satisfy Kenyans need on oil energy We should only export surplus. 0 oil import will boost Kenyan economy @MigunaMiguna @UKenyatta  our economy will only be safe if we use the oil for domestic purpose and do away with export
2675 2018-06-03 18:24:48 Idle thought about the early oil export from Kenya...I wonder who prepared the customs declaration and what value the crude oil  was given.
2676 2018-06-03 18:24:47 Who else feels like most Kenyans won't benefit from the crude oil?

2679 2018-06-03 18:24:15 it was getting the frying effect without having to deep fry which really sold me. the first few tries (without oil) had me rethinking, but then i got an evo bottle from bb&b and i was done for.
2680 2018-06-03 18:24:06 Get you some peppermint oil to wipe those suckers out! Just mix a little of that and some water and you can spray it on and around your plants to keep them away.

2687 2018-06-03 18:23:42 Good point, thght where does our oild come from, as u say NorthSae, ME & USa, only oil  & gas producing EU states are Denmark & Romania.  Still good to show quite har far t Project Fear has progressed.  wld write more but off to Boots to stick up on pills, Tesco for tin food.....
2688 2018-06-03 18:23:42 Exactly... It was wenger’s failure to adapt tactically that saw Arsenal struggle to compete in his last 10 years... not oil money
2689 2018-06-03 18:23:35 Exactly, refining the oil locally would not only create jobs but also improve our local eceonomy.
2690 2018-06-03 18:23:34 Unfortunately, the average Kenyan doesn't know these things and are busy celebrating oil exports and anticipating the coming wealth.
2691 2018-06-03 18:23:33 Remember Trump boasting he would steal Iraq's oil. Is it more shocking he promised war crime openly, or that we always do things like that but with more tact ?
2692 2018-06-03 18:23:24 Typical troll tactic--he can't admit that he's wrong, because doing so would undermine his whole agenda. But he's got to keep pushing that agenda.

2697 2018-06-03 18:22:53 Its common sense not fancy economic theories that if you continually buy from your neighbour, it's they who will grow wealthier. Let's develop our capacities to refine oil esp now that we have ours. Oil affects every sector. We get hold of that, our entire economy will grow 2fold
2698 2018-06-03 18:22:50 Canada's top 5 states as trading partners are Michigan/auto industry, Illinois/crude oil, California/agriculture, New York/gold for your national banking industry and Texas/oil/agriculture. The list for July 1 is the same as all the other Allies and hopefully discussed at the G7.
2699 2018-06-03 18:22:47 That’s funny. They’re prices didn’t drop when oil prices were low!
2700 2018-06-03 18:22:41 I'd rather cut off my own head and pan fry it in olive oil

2702 2018-06-03 18:22:32 Somebody explain to me  slowly like a grade 1 kid; if Kenya imports crude oil,  why are we exporting it?Am not feeling well. @MigunaMiguna #Checkpoint
2703 2018-06-03 18:22:28 I still pop popcorn on the stove. None of that chemical laden microwave garbage in this house. I bought us a nice steel pot with glass lid. Try popping using macademia nut oil. Outstanding!
2704 2018-06-03 18:22:24 The Black Gold of Turkana season 1 loading....... I can already smell something sweet in use of trucks to transport the crude oil,  exporting the crude oil and importing the finished product. This will be one intriguing series..

2719 2018-06-03 18:20:46 1 small onion, finely sliced and brown in a tiny bit of vegetable oil. Add dry spices, a 1/4 tsp of turmeric powder, 1/2 tsp of coriander powder, salt to taste, chilli powder to taste. Fry until spices are cooked, add small cubes of potatoes, 1/3 tin of chopped tomatoes.

2721 2018-06-03 18:20:40 Great collection! I have a few more around too. Friend said you can add  a little essential oil when you burn them too, works with any  unscented candle, going to try that soon
2722 2018-06-03 18:20:39 Perhaps oil is too costly therefor @RailMinIndia can't afford it and train going late. ..
2723 2018-06-03 18:20:33 @LBC John Redwood is absolutely living in cloud cuckoo land - talking total snake oil and unicorn fantasy. You needed to ask why he advised his clients to move their money out of the UK.
2724 2018-06-03 18:20:32 No one is stopping anyone from investing in that product. Maybe Obama or Hillary would put up their own money?
2725 2018-06-03 18:20:29 In 2017, The Attorney General, Raúl Cervantes, announces the government will adopt the stratgey Colombia uses to fight gas and oil theft from pipelines.
2726 2018-06-03 18:20:25 If oil didn't transform Nigeria into a 1st world country, I don't see it helping Kenya, a mirror image of NG.
2727 2018-06-03 18:20:24 Speaking in Turkana, during the flagging off of the trucks carrying crude oil from Lokichar to Mombasa, president Kenyatta issued a 'shoot to kill' order for bandits who won't surrender guns in Kapedo.

2735 2018-06-03 18:19:34 There actually WAS a demand for a kill switch on cell phones by people who used them.

Nice try.
2736 2018-06-03 18:19:28 Oil is the word on almost everyone's mouths in Kenya today,here in Nakuru it's no different. These simple sentiments when magnified turn to everyone wanting a piece of the pie. Oil has been a curse elsewhere but I hope that for once we'll do things differently.
2737 2018-06-03 18:19:24 Dawn dish soap normally works pretty good bc its not oil based. Soak the spot with water... than soap and back with water again.
2738 2018-06-03 18:19:21 So I go to Wal-Mart for the $20 oil change ,ok have my spare changed with front pass.side. no charge, hell ya. AND A BROKEN BRAKE LINE. West tusc Canton.
2739 2018-06-03 18:19:21 Interestingly, we sabotage ourselves in every corner.
We can't even use land trains to transport the crude oil coz our roads can't support.
Just thinking of a lorry carrying 120 barrels instead of dragging ×3 the amount.
Could be best if roads can support.
2740 2018-06-03 18:19:21 You can tell this food list is pre-Single market. Look at the list of crap food they advise you to stock up on!No rice, no pasta, quinoa type stuff. No pasta sauces, tinned pulses, tinned tomatoes, cooking oil, tetra pak milk/juice etc. At least we can stockpile better food now.

2745 2018-06-03 18:19:03 The economists I interviewed said that pipeline revenues are stable and don't fluctuate the way producers' revenues do. And keep in mind that oil sands producers don't cut back production when prices fall (in some case they boost output to lower per unit costs).
2746 2018-06-03 18:18:52 i learned the trick of using an oil diffuser (the evo bottle really is great and is on qvc as well as in bed, bath, & beyond) and it makes such a difference!!

2751 2018-06-03 18:18:37 They're not EU leaders enemies, they're their oil rich buddies. They're our enemies.

2753 2018-06-03 18:18:27 Is it just me or is Turkana getting only 5% of the oil too little?
2754 2018-06-03 18:18:21 So the NJ law has been repealed? School me.
2755 2018-06-03 18:18:18 Oil and polítical pressure, the price isn't real . The reduction in the use is a must. OPEC is a cartel, very bad for the markets.
2756 2018-06-03 18:18:17 eu and Canada started . Canada admitted to dumping Chinese steel abusing nafta , oil under sanctions allies cut Nordstream 2 ,we sanctioned Russia again ,Canada threaten to pull their oil pipeline . Two national security industries allies went after .
2757 2018-06-03 18:18:15 Renewable energy is truly a great step forward, but when you have @realDonaldTrump & his clowns denying climate change, taking scientific research out of the EPA, denying human impact climate change, allowing drilling for oil in sensitive areas, his claims are beyond a disgrace!
2758 2018-06-03 18:18:11 The oil from Turkana should benefit the nothern marginalized communities. They need water, roads, food, hospitals and schools

2764 2018-06-03 18:17:26 It’s a dealership silly they always take that long they bullshit for about 1:30 of that 2 hours and take the other 30 minutes changing the oil
2765 2018-06-03 18:17:21 @ntvkenya why would kenya export the crude oil while kenya is a major importer of oil? Misplaced priorities

2773 2018-06-03 18:16:37 Indeed. Genie Energy is worth looking into, you will recognise some globalists sitting on the board. They are after the Golan Heights. Apparently has more oil than in Saudi Arabia.
2774 2018-06-03 18:16:34 my mother gave me a fish oil supplement and I broke it in half and swallowed the oil from it. don't ever do that if you like yourself.

2782 2018-06-03 18:16:05 Can someone make me understand why we are exporting oil instead of refining and sell it locally to citizens. Saving money lost in foreign exchange to acquire external oil.

2829 2018-06-03 18:11:54 Exactly. It's your land. You should earn a percentage. That's how it works in AK. Alaska's natural oil wealth was created by no one and is considered as owned by all Alaskans, so the rights to drill are sold to oil companies, and 25% is put into a fund that pays dividends to all.
2830 2018-06-03 18:11:52 Adorable. The impetus for the veto of the repeal of the law that @NRA opposed...was the law @NRA opposed.
2831 2018-06-03 18:11:39 2000 barrels per day (projected) at today's oil price is $47m per year. Trucking costs alone will be around $3m p.y. min. At the moment, this is a complete vanity project. Nothing more. #beskeptical #questions #misdirection
2832 2018-06-03 18:11:35 What’s even funnier than that is the Aluminum and Steel mills, and most of the oil and gas companies, are American companies.

2879 2018-06-03 18:06:41 Oh no, do. When I was 11 my cat fell in some car oil. When I say some I mean about a foot, in one of those tubs that they'd left uncovered.
 He survived but I followed the footprints, and smacked on the door and yelled at the guy.
2880 2018-06-03 18:06:39 A few years from now 'The Ngamia 8 Oil Scandal' will be all over the news. Wait. 
2881 2018-06-03 18:06:29 it’s not makeup technically, but the brand Sol de Janeiro is everything right now. Their body oil is a Rihanna body lava dupe. 35 bucks and it smells and looks amazinggg
2882 2018-06-03 18:06:28 Twitter's a public forum. People come and go as they please. I'm sure that distresses you as well.
2883 2018-06-03 18:06:19 This is what happens when you try to mix English & Maths; they just don’t work. A bit like oil & water!!!
2884 2018-06-03 18:06:16 That food was oil 
2885 2018-06-03 18:06:13 Now that we are exporting oil can the govt (parliament) kill all taxes imposed by ERC with immediate effect.

2888 2018-06-03 18:06:09 You are over analyzing Trump. He’s starting a trade war to destroy the western economy simply because Putin ordered him to do so. Ditto re high oil prices.
2889 2018-06-03 18:06:03 Kenya does not refined crude oil anymore?
2890 2018-06-03 18:05:59 Justin???  Justin???  Daddy's boy???   Ultra Liberal talk, talk, talk, and I'll bet Justin doesn't even know about the US oil embargo, US corporations fleeing US to China in the 70's, 80's, 90,s? Greed of CEO's.
2891 2018-06-03 18:05:50 World morally bankrupt. Saudis pretend to be pious muslim land, yet massacres thousands in Yemen. Shia Iran though does not export global terror like Saudi Wahabis,it has proxies in Yemen. America for oil/energy needs and for arms sales supports Saudis; exploits Shia-Sunni divide
2892 2018-06-03 18:05:49 What you mix yours with ? Cause I kno you could use water or apple cider vinegar and some kind of oil cause it’ll dry out yo face hella much

Now what veto are you on about?
2895 2018-06-03 18:05:26 I got real Italian olive oil. Tastes better than what I’ve been using.
2896 2018-06-03 18:05:22 The coconut oil in coffee does NOTHING guess what I’m still freakin hungry
2897 2018-06-03 18:05:20 Don’t we want a NJ native to weight in?
2898 2018-06-03 18:05:14 •Use Jamaican black castor oil to help thicken your hair!! (It works) It smells great too
•Olive oil (Can’t go wrong with that)
•African best castor oil. Massage gently throughout scalp everyday.
•Wrap your hair at night so them edges won’t disappear (I learned the hard way)
2899 2018-06-03 18:05:11 That is very well stated! Communities cannot wait for the oil to be sold before they receive benefits.
2900 2018-06-03 18:05:07 Must be standing too close to those fumes the oil money is burning off of

2904 2018-06-03 18:04:57 Answered that already, but for you, one more time. It was not a clean repeal bill, it was tied into other gun proposals. It was only part of an unacceptable deal. So, no he didn't veto it in the manner of your characterization.
2905 2018-06-03 18:04:44 Not #FakeFrenchFriesFacts: Fried in pure olive oil; no seeds, nothing else.
2906 2018-06-03 18:04:41 Why the NJ law repeal veto?
2907 2018-06-03 18:04:39 Oil change , Tire Rotation & Alignment All done for less than $50 I fucks wit my car plug lol
2908 2018-06-03 18:04:38 Yeah but they’re not oil based and even before I started using makeup, my skin was like that :( I just need to find the right products I guess
2909 2018-06-03 18:04:25 @hollyfinchhh_ have you tried cannabis oil for your anxiety?
2910 2018-06-03 18:04:16 Boleh explain more pasal kerja oil and gas tu?

2912 2018-06-03 18:04:09 But he’ll happily let the chinese do it and oil companies.. he’s a joke #cdnpoli
2913 2018-06-03 18:04:04 The price of oil needed to rise! That is the best piece of BS in a whole pile that you keep tweeting. Bottom line.. you support a #racist #lying #CINO then you are one as well. One who will spew hatred towards everyone who doesn't agree with your skewed view of reality.
2914 2018-06-03 18:03:53 The initial “impetus” was three years before the NJ law...it’s gun sales. 

What was the impetus for the VETO?
2915 2018-06-03 18:03:49 Happy birthday mac!
2916 2018-06-03 18:03:43 If you want a gun that you call smart, make one. Or get someone to make one for you. Just don't mandate that others can only buy what you call smart guns.

But since that isn't sufficiently meddlesome, you control freaks will never accept it.
2917 2018-06-03 18:03:40 You know some of that oil is from nexen? Right? That company that Harper gave away the farm to?So if they can’t get their price we make up the difference for them. That’s a harpertard conservative deal. Like Dotard would do.Harper and nexen?Remember? #dontvoteconservative
2918 2018-06-03 18:03:39 Alright, they need to hurry with my oil change cause I have a nap scheduled at 11:30

2920 2018-06-03 18:03:25 The Turkana people should be the first beneficiary to this new opportunity... They should get good schools, hospitals, etc. 
Hope the cartels will not take over like they have done it to Uasin gishu farmers. #SayNo to cartels in Turkana oil.
2921 2018-06-03 18:03:12 With oil prices near $70 per barrel. The energy jobs should be good paying American jobs.
2922 2018-06-03 18:03:00 It will though I think many organizations had reached that point over the past year or so. problem is some are stuck with the players they have (aka the Edmonton Oilers)
2923 2018-06-03 18:02:53 Paris climate accords would have decreased oil production tax coal and oil use and increased renewable expenditures

2926 2018-06-03 18:02:35 You'll no doubt be aware that Scottish oil isn't as big an issue as it used to be. Tax receipts have collapsed big time.
2927 2018-06-03 18:02:30 Lots of prayers. Keto or Mediterranean diet. Rick Simpson oil. Vit. C and B.17. Known plenty of people to cure themselves naturally. Diet change is most important

2929 2018-06-03 18:02:19 I tried to tell my work husband this week to massage his belly with coconut oil because that's where you keep all of your rage. He got pissed at me for mentioning coconut oil because it made him hungry and then went off to order Popeyes. 
2930 2018-06-03 18:02:12 Nobody's stopping him, if he makes a product people want he'll do well. But if he wants to sell a stinker, well...  Don't people read Consumer Reports?

2933 2018-06-03 18:02:05 Why are you being tedious?
2934 2018-06-03 18:02:03 Shoutout to my Dad for changing the oil in my car in 20 mins for $30 vs Chevy wanting $85+ & waiting all day! 
2935 2018-06-03 18:02:00 Qumulo is focused on HPC and large-scale unstructured data workloads in media and entertainment, life sciences, higher education, oil and gas, and others.
2936 2018-06-03 18:01:48 In matters of industrialization. Lokichar is far away from the railway belt where 70% of Kenyans live. Industrialisation will, hence, be experienced far away in the latter areas. Oil extraction is not labor intensive  to change a place completely.
2937 2018-06-03 18:01:46 Well during his term Dems were touting his success. My point is he hampered growth by mandating companies with 50+ employees cover healthcare and mandating HC for everyone plus hampering oil expedition and fracking and adding T of new refs. Also the Paris climate

2941 2018-06-03 18:01:27 Is it baby oil time yet ? @FinnBalor
2942 2018-06-03 18:01:17 If someone powerful asks you to do them a favour but the favour happens to be something you intended to do anyway (keep oil in Goldilocks zone $60-80) why not agree and be owed a favour back...works until someone else you partner with calls u out as a pupit to original requester.
2943 2018-06-03 18:01:10 The emissions cap is much misunderstood. As @SPhillipsAB explained to me in an interview, CCI will lower carbon-intensity of crude oil, allowing production to rise while oil sands emissions remain around 70 Mt. Cap is the penalty if producers don't act.
2944 2018-06-03 18:01:06 that clay and vinegar is a mask , then the witch hazels is for after . the tea tree oil is for spots , gotta dilute it with aloe vera or castor oil and dab it on your spots and rinse off and shit , i use to have really rough skin i don’t break out at all no more
2945 2018-06-03 18:01:01 Mag pri prito sana ako. Prep na lahat. Ending, wala palang oil. 
2946 2018-06-03 18:00:55 In my opinion Ford is just another con man selling fake Trump snake oil.  Unbelievable 37% of people in Ontario are on board with his bs.
2947 2018-06-03 18:00:51 we are #Canadian need to change our point of view after #NAFTA agreement. We have to make a decision based on our own interest. Like USA did. We need to make a oil separation in Canada because of the higher price of oil.

2949 2018-06-03 18:00:50 But sad to see armed police escorting a CRUDE oil truck 50yrs plus after independence. You can’t do much with crude oil. I support #Shoot2Kill order by @UKenyatta. Time to pacify this region
2950 2018-06-03 18:00:50 That Jubilee will be exporting crude oil from Turkana to China and then importing it back, is one of the biggest joke of our lifetime.
It’s cheaper to upgrade the changamwe refinery than ship the oil to China, unless the export is for paying China for building the SGR to Naivasha
2951 2018-06-03 18:00:45 The entire *country* of Belize produces less than 2,000 bbl per day of oil. By comparison, the US produces over 10 million bbl per day. This is like Switzerland banning banana plantations. 
2952 2018-06-03 18:00:39 another nice one to try. get some veggies, par-boiled root veg work well (taters, carrots, sweet potato, butternut squash) or sweet veg (toms, peppers, onions), coat them in a little olive oil and toss them in a couple of teaspoons of the rub.... Grill those badboys!
2953 2018-06-03 18:00:28 Holy shit that was prolly the easiest repair ever. Took like 3 mins to replace that oil pressure sensor on my gti
2954 2018-06-03 18:00:27 Not my job to prove your point. It’s YOUR job to do that. I’ve already disproven your demagoguery repeatedly. Therefore you are a paid bot, an ignorant troll, or just plain lazy at supporting your stance. Or all three, they aren’t mutually exclusive. Which are you? Be honest now.
2955 2018-06-03 18:00:26 @justice4earth Good for you Oscar. I read your petition and am joining the fight to ditch palm oil. Come on 
@Tesco the planet deserves better I will not set foot in your stores til you ditch some things, palm oil being one. #losethepalmoil

2957 2018-06-03 17:59:55 I also like the message that oil companies must go away!
2958 2018-06-03 17:59:54 Have you seen any studies with liposomal hemp oil?  I have seen life-changing effects with a few of my clients who have severe cases of IBD
2959 2018-06-03 17:59:49 No, no, no. I can only eat churros if they are still sizzling from the oil, with a freshly squeezed orange juice and morning coffee. Preferably in the Tribunal area of Madrid. The infrequency adds to the delight, also a good way of avoiding even more weight gain. 
2960 2018-06-03 17:59:37 America, first you attempt to take down our guy Drizzy then you slap tariffs on our steel and aluminum trade? One more strike and we’re taking away things we gave to you; basketball, Ryan Gosling, canola oil. You’re only hurting yourself. This is serious.

2963 2018-06-03 17:59:06 @ahubaoscar why is your country exporting crude oil while it actually imports the same..though processed?
2964 2018-06-03 17:59:02 Nutox cleansing oil pn best. 
2965 2018-06-03 17:58:59 We are just a funny people. So now we are exporting oil??? We have satisfied our internal demand to the point of export!! We are buying petrol at expensive rates, and here we are exporting!!! Hehe!! I rest my case.
2966 2018-06-03 17:58:49 Oh, so you would like to correct the record? 

Was a repeal passed?

Did the GOP governor veto it?

#gunsense
2967 2018-06-03 17:58:41 Minister of finance..boo-hoo. U borrowed money, u increased auto tariffs,taxes on corporates and personal are on the rise, oil boom yet nothing to show for it. Fuel and forex is still smoking weed, what difference will we experience if this is done?
2968 2018-06-03 17:58:32 Gas prices haven't been this high since the LAST Republican Administration.

Now I'm not saying that the GOP is totally owned by the oil & gas industry, but...

Oh wait. Yes I am.
2969 2018-06-03 17:58:27 The tariffs a method for Trump to find suckers to pay for his massive tax cuts to the wealthy, including his family. He's not complicated. Just a con man selling fake snake oil
2970 2018-06-03 17:58:25 Kanye reminds me of those pastors selling miracle oil, fuck outta here
2971 2018-06-03 17:58:16 Dennis refuses to explain why he won't start a company to design guns the way he wants them. He seems to think the NRA is preventing him somehow.
2972 2018-06-03 17:58:09 Look, I'm not going to debate with you about whether oil is a renewable energy source or not. It's foolish. Progress would be finding a better, renewable source of energy that doesn't pollute. It's simply the responsible thing to do.
2973 2018-06-03 17:58:08 @GOP doesn’t care. Evangelicals want Jerusalem, 1% wants money, oil/ gas companies want to drill, racists want a white America, Koch brothers want private no science schools. A big nasty tent
2974 2018-06-03 17:58:05 There's supposed to be a cap on size of oil sands development right? How does that jibe w 10 new lines? Like anything else, if they want to survive they'll need to shoot for new tech in a transistion to new energy sources. I realize that's not going to happen overnight of course.
2975 2018-06-03 17:58:02 Please do not make me drive to you just to force you to get your oil changed. It will take 15 minutes. I believe in your capabilities to get this done today! 
2976 2018-06-03 17:57:59 Exactly.  Europe refuses to get tough on Russia. Want to really hurt Russia?  Put sanctions on their commodities.  Don’t let them trade, period.  Their economy is wholly dependent on oil. Watch Russia collapse when they can’t sell their oil.
2977 2018-06-03 17:57:58 U don't have to vent ur frustration on the illegal usage of our oil money on social media alone, u take a legal action against the govt if u so much believe there's an illegality.

2987 2018-06-03 17:55:45 I presume people look at #oil production/exports data from 2012-2015 and forecast/think that US withdraw from #JCPOA will have the same effects as previous #sanctions...

2992 2018-06-03 17:55:10 Oil and gas are completely different than coal.  I’d think u would realize that.  Your hurting those industries by propping up coal by artificial means
2993 2018-06-03 17:55:03 A world in transformation by @IEA:
1. Rapid deployment and falling costs of clean energy technologies.
2. Growing electrification of energy, the shift to a more services-oriented economy and a cleaner energy mix in China.
3. Resilience of shale gas and tight oil in the EEUU.
2994 2018-06-03 17:55:01 It usually says it on the oil cap or owners manual
2995 2018-06-03 17:54:45 i'm at the part during church where the priest smears oil on your forehead and he smeared it on my bangs ayo bro you have a fucking pipeline to god doesn't he ever tell you how long styling my bangs can take
2996 2018-06-03 17:54:39 “The man who wears the star.” This is a quote from one of my favorite 1960’s oil company #TV commercials - for #Texaco - when the “service station” reigned in the USA, and a driver saying “Fill ‘er up” meant a “gas station” attendant would pump gas into your car, and much more.
2997 2018-06-03 17:54:35 Yes liberals have been kicking the oil industry in the teeth for 3 years now, but we need to stand united on the steel industry? Really?
2998 2018-06-03 17:54:34 The price of oil needed to rise.  Health care is screwed because of your communist BHO, but trump will fix it.  There is no trade war, it’s called negotiation.  It will all play out and you libs can go back to pointing out his spelling errors 
2999 2018-06-03 17:54:30 we are #Canadian need to change our point of view after #NAFTA agreement. We have to make a decision based on our own interest. Like USA did. We need to make a oil separation in Canada because of the higher price of oil. We have oil here why we are paying higher price
3000 2018-06-03 17:54:30 I don't think Europe even cares about being defended. They just want gas and oil and pray that Russia doesn't show up one day with its tanks and drunk soldiers.

3005 2018-06-03 17:53:42 Question: Since it's an oil can the oil be transferred right after touching the plant? For example, if I rubbed the palm of hand all over the ivy and then immediately shook someone's hand would they get the rash too?
3006 2018-06-03 17:53:34 Spent some time in Dubai and it's beautsss! They discovered oil in the late 60s and developed so much from it. Made me sad thinking Nigeria has sooo much potential 
3007 2018-06-03 17:53:34 Yes, that is what the initial impetus against the technology came from, common knowledge.
3008 2018-06-03 17:53:12 @Tesco: ditch palm oil in your own brand products! Over 300 football fields of rainforest are cleared EVERY HOUR for new palm oil plantations – and your continued use of palm oil is contributing. Take responsibility!
3009 2018-06-03 17:53:09 Tis an embarrassment that 55 years later we still export what we produce in its raw form.. why don’t we process the crude oil and sell it locally ? ? ?

3015 2018-06-03 17:52:43 Lirio Mexican bar soap! It’s for washing clothes, and I used fresh aloe Vera to remove my dark spots! Right after I’m out of the shower, I moisturize with baby oil gel 
3016 2018-06-03 17:52:36 I just soaked myself in baby oil  my body feels so amazing.
3017 2018-06-03 17:52:28 Is non GMO verified a hoax?  I've bought products with this label that most certainly contain GMOs..e.g. good natured selects pnut butter pretzels.  Canola oil is listed but it's not cold pressed..pnut butter is not organic and neither is the wheat!
3018 2018-06-03 17:52:19 Omg you and Boston pizza. Lol oil and vinegar

3020 2018-06-03 17:52:09 No, liar, I said that the law in question worked against the development of "smart" guns. That does not mean that it is the only thing doing so.

3026 2018-06-03 17:51:45 As for cars, I think gas and oil cars are a relic from a different age. They need a modern fuel that is environmentally friendly.
3027 2018-06-03 17:51:43 Or sweaty hands, dirty hands, middle of the night, it's not a technology that should or can be mandated. It easily violates Heller, no sane person would want that for home defense.

3031 2018-06-03 17:51:32 As for your “shill” question...he has said that he believes a strong economy and clean air and water are not mutually exclusive. That’s the extent of what I know about “shilling” but if you believe every conversation with an oil company is sinister, I can’t help you.
3032 2018-06-03 17:51:32 When someone promoting something like ketogenic diets for cancer aligns himself with snake oil hucksters selling rank quackery, my skeptical antennae start twitching and I think that maybe the guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
3033 2018-06-03 17:51:22 Loving the class mix of jellied eel and olive oil! This sums me up perfectly! Proud jellied eel with a few dashes of olive oil!
3034 2018-06-03 17:51:02 Aberdeen- isn`t that a large oil port too? North sea oil is off the coast of Scotland isn`t it? Is Buzzard oil field the largest found to date (just off the west coast of scotland)?
3035 2018-06-03 17:51:01 Unfortunately this is the world we live in. Why don’t we refine our own oil and have pipelines that go both directions?  We have the projects planned yet everyone seems to be against them or at least they all get cancelled.
3036 2018-06-03 17:50:55 Lol. Please tell me you got your oil changed?
3037 2018-06-03 17:50:34 I’ve literally been waiting to get my oil changed for 6 hours. That’s a whollle shift bitch

3039 2018-06-03 17:50:26 Alah apa pulak tuuuuu :( i dah beli moisturiser, toner, tea tree oil, acne cream, now i kena beli serum pula keee 
3040 2018-06-03 17:50:24 But it dries your skin after. Apply moisturizer. The more dry (and clean as you think of it), the more oil it produces after.
3041 2018-06-03 17:50:11 Update I also bought a turmeric wellness shot and I have coconut oil in my hair I HAVE ARRIVED
3042 2018-06-03 17:49:58 The law said that once "smart" guns were on the market, only "smart" guns could be sold in the state. It was a stupid law, and it hurt your desires.
3043 2018-06-03 17:49:52 You said the NJ law was the problem...it’s not, is it?

3048 2018-06-03 17:49:36 i advise everyone reading this to invest in HEMP OIL. you can use it for fuckin anything & its rly good for you but i will never use another lotion/moisturizer bc this shit is heavenly and makes me so soft 
3049 2018-06-03 17:49:28 let’s not forget that in freshman year i wrote a 7 page research paper on memes and did an oil painting of pepe the frog

3052 2018-06-03 17:49:18 How was the 1 million barrels per day reduction calculated?

It's highly unlikely that #Iran's #oil exports will fall by that much provided that we "only" have unilateral sanctions by #Trump!
3053 2018-06-03 17:49:16 @JustinTrudeau Trump's not complicated. The tariffs are his method to get other suckers to pay for his massive tax breaks for his family and wealthy friends. He's just an old fashion con man selling snake  oil.

3059 2018-06-03 17:48:53 Sadly for the City Group oil barons, it's more difficult to buy an MLS Cup than buying the EPL. Nothing stopping buying a stadium though, weird you don't have one.
3060 2018-06-03 17:48:42 Christie did not veto that as a stand alone, it was tied to other gun issues. Not what you think. The smart gun law was passed in 2002, long before there was even a decent working lab model. The law didn't appear put of thin air, it was debated for years prior to passing. Sorry.
3061 2018-06-03 17:48:42 Time for the penny pinchers to sell, bring someone with deep pockets, sell it to a Qatar oil baron, this way they would bring in #Harper and #Machado I want my @Yankees to have competition

3068 2018-06-03 17:48:01 Wrong again #swamprat! If we deal with polititions like you who have been taking bribes on the backs of American people for decades, we can negotiate lower prices with the oil companies or create more competition for them through alternative sources. #MarketDriven
3069 2018-06-03 17:47:40 Most important, we need to know  the cost of refining the oil bearing in mind the transport cost to overseas and back, by-products handling and who is to benefit. In short Kenya needs its own refinery which am told shud cost sh120b
3070 2018-06-03 17:47:34 coconut oil as a moisturizer is the goat. makes you smell amazing and makes your skin soft as a frikkin baby
3071 2018-06-03 17:47:21 What a sweety...
In Portugal we would make collars of eucalyptus pods against ticks. I suppose a few drops eucalyptus essential oil in a carrier oil between toes and around neck will do the trick. The thing is dogs hate the smell, oh well...

3080 2018-06-03 17:46:27 I am curious to how you verify.  I've bought products with your seal that contain canola oil which is not labeled as cold pressed!  Some of the products do not contain any organic ingredients either.  How are you verify ingredients?
3081 2018-06-03 17:46:26 And there's the problem that if you need to hand a working gun to someone else, all of those things get in the way.
3082 2018-06-03 17:46:18 I'm not denying that waste disposal is expensive and difficult. Claiming that nuclear power as a whole is worse than coal and oil is, however, simply erroneous.

3100 2018-06-03 17:43:49 The government should now think of building a refinery to Western Kenya so that we can easily export oil to landlocked countries other than Mombasa which is 1000km away from turkana
3101 2018-06-03 17:43:46 Yeah.
I wonder why all these foreign countries sell to US to get usd for? To buy oil and commodities maybe? Just price them in other currencies and the foreign countries will no longer want usd.

3118 2018-06-03 17:42:07 The reason is simple, years ago a law was passed in New Jersey thst stated once the AG approved a smart handgun, ONLY smart handguns would be legal for sale.  So it woukd outlaw every non-smart gun. The NRA wisely opposed this as a mandate.

3126 2018-06-03 17:40:50 People really need to stop using this argument. You sound like toddlers. Just because people don't want to expand the pipeline doesn't mean we think we can go without oil. Lets use less on things that matter. Not single use plastics, crappy kids toys, dollar store junk...etc...

3144 2018-06-03 17:39:05 We currently are NOT selling significant amounts to Asia, only a few small tankers / month to California refiners with Heavy Oil Coker’s. There is NO safety record to compare with, if we haven’t done much of this before. Selling oil to Asia is a new, stupid idea!

3147 2018-06-03 17:38:30 Stop propping up middle-eastern dictators so you can have a "special relationship" ie. access to their oil.

That's my economic argument.
3148 2018-06-03 17:38:28 I don’t understand much about oil but I know Wakili is a sharp mind. They say poverty leads to innovation but not in Africa!
3149 2018-06-03 17:38:26 funny my smart phone isnt smart all the time. Often I have to type in the pw instead because it cant or wont read my fingerprint. I sure dont want that happening when I need my gun to function.
3150 2018-06-03 17:38:02 .......And still killing Biafrans by proxy through islamist Nigeria and for the same oil till today.
3151 2018-06-03 17:38:00 #FakeFrenchFriesFacts the best ones are fried in motor oil

3153 2018-06-03 17:37:43 If It Be Oil Theft,then For Her Being In Possession Of The Monies Of Stolen Products,she Is Still Going For Death Sentence With Option Of Life Imprisonment,as An Accomplice To Such Crime,so No Escape For Her.
3154 2018-06-03 17:37:40 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
3155 2018-06-03 17:37:34 It’s a fryer that doesn’t use oil to make fried goodies
3156 2018-06-03 17:37:29 WEIRD ASS QUESTION. DOES ANYONE HAVE SOME VALVE OIL LMAO
3157 2018-06-03 17:37:27 Squash
Combine egg & milk together.
In a second bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, salt, pepper & garlic salt. 
Dip yellow squash slices first in the egg mixture, then dredge in the dry mixture.
Heat 1/2 inch of oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. 
Fry squash until golden brown.
3158 2018-06-03 17:37:12 All PSU Oil Company said they mix 10% Ethanol/Bio Diesel in Fuel Oil.Does it included in the price mechanism of Petrol & Diesel?Does Bio Diesel & Ethanol r covered by GST?I Think..YES !! @CMO_Odisha @Naveen_Odisha @dpradhanbjp @sasmitpatra @samasmrati @ANI @AAP4ODISHA @Giridhari_
3159 2018-06-03 17:37:02 Yeah cloves like what you put in pumpkin pie lol I believe you can get the oil at a store like sprouts.

Simply the best 
3162 2018-06-03 17:36:29 Too hot for lotion right now. Eucalyptus body oil all summer 2018.
3163 2018-06-03 17:36:06 Alaskan oil tankers do no sail to or from Westridge Marine Terminal in Burnaby and pass through Metro Vancouver and the Burrard Inlet with 650 000 barrels of toxic and flammable sludge. Where’s your business case for selling oil to Asia to prove its anymore profitable!

3168 2018-06-03 17:35:46 Kenya exporting oil...it's a milestone for Kenya but i do fear this ninja called  william ruto....I know he is thinking how to own that turkana oil field.
3169 2018-06-03 17:35:42 Let’s remember how oil and lumber  the USA receives from Canada. Let’s talk tariffs shall we  .....
3170 2018-06-03 17:35:33 @realDonaldTrump  how much do you buy Canadian oil for and how much do you sell it for ?   Fuck your trade war    I hope  one day you are poor in money and not just in  moral
3171 2018-06-03 17:35:21 Coconut oil has literally been my bestfriend for the past 2 yrs !!!
3172 2018-06-03 17:35:19 Extra virgin olive oil is the greatest thing on this earth
3173 2018-06-03 17:35:16 そろそろおうち帰るべ
3174 2018-06-03 17:35:14 It made my hair flaky. I like the Argan oil one.
3175 2018-06-03 17:35:10 They have coconut oil?  The range here in this country is too small.   only recently did they start stocking their liquid(massage-like) oil
3176 2018-06-03 17:35:10 Great news.

It’s a pity The Telegraph didn’t mention that the alternative therapy was cannabis oil.
3177 2018-06-03 17:35:06 Why not just ramrod some Big Oil project down the throahts of the tribal members in your state and reap the benefits of all that $$ spent making sure that they are not able to effectively defend their own descendants futures from poisoning? Worked last time. Might again. #NoDAPL
3178 2018-06-03 17:35:01 The parable you speak of is very important since all start with oil in their lamps eager for the appearing of the Bridegroom. Why do you think the foolish virgins might lack sufficient oil for the night? (Why would they not bring extra vials of oil?)
3179 2018-06-03 17:35:00 Hey when there is excess price goes down not up.  Think about it the reason they ship over seas is so there is less here and so the demand dictates the price! Think of oil the more in the market the cheaper it is.
3180 2018-06-03 17:34:44 Some silicone oil might penetrate and add some lubrication to the connection so you can get them apart, you would just need to clean it off well afterward so it doesn't affect the connection of the new sensor. A little cleanup is a lot easier than breaking the connector or wire.
3181 2018-06-03 17:34:42 The used cooking oil is used by dry cleaners, to Starch shirts. #FakeFrenchFriesFacts
3182 2018-06-03 17:34:23 @SpeedcoPM has gone down hill ever since @LovesTravelStop has bought them. Not enough employees and the ones they have agree it’s worse instead of better. You now pay to grease fifth wheel. No extra oil when you put in Lucas. Filters are their brand which are inferior.
3183 2018-06-03 17:34:16 Hot oil treatments always make me feel like a new person 
3184 2018-06-03 17:34:14 Non Of Our Oil Transaction Is From Oil Theft,if Is oil,they Will Not Pass Via The International Waters,the Certifcates Of Deposite Are Available,if You Doubt Me Collect The Document From President Of Worldbank And Call The International Companies.
3185 2018-06-03 17:33:54 You ARE part of LGBT+. You are family. You belong. And no one should tell you otherwise.

And if you (general) say any of those don’t belong? Go fuck yourself with a very long spike. Covered in spikes. Dipped in hot oil. 

Because we are supppsed to be accepting and welcoming.
3186 2018-06-03 17:33:35 The oil field guys all act like this around here. Money and toys is their life.. if that business ever went bust. They’d all be fucked.
3187 2018-06-03 17:33:23 Dear God, who ordered a C.O. Cocktail? Castor oil prepared soda? Yuck.
Maybe they gave that to bad customers?
3188 2018-06-03 17:32:56 Selling coconut oil and getting people to write his rhymes perhaps?...
3189 2018-06-03 17:32:53 Exactly. Both Powerful NIGERIANS & Multinational oil companies have looted substantial % of our oil wealth undeclared, some %tage is further siphoned by unscrupulous officials in NNPC, Local oil companies, marketers & ministry of petroleum big wigs in d past.We need to stop dis.
3190 2018-06-03 17:32:53 Ready oil pump hnd blade..
3191 2018-06-03 17:32:35 I use a wet washcloth with some drops of a headache essential oil blend, it is a nice relief until my 3 ibuprofen kick in. I probably need 4 but I don't want to take any more
3192 2018-06-03 17:32:31 Then why is Honduras deforesting 98% of their lowland jungles for palm oil production?

3194 2018-06-03 17:32:20 Guys since I’ve been in Wisconsin, Kev washed my car, got my oil changed, bought me seat covers and is now hanging out with my family. What’d I do to deserve this man 
3195 2018-06-03 17:32:18 No. We don't care about some random oil reserves in the middle east. In case you haven't noticed, the US figured out how to tap US reserves far in excess of total middle eastern reserves a decade ago. Haven't cared since, find some other excuse for your problems.
3196 2018-06-03 17:32:18 And it is what will always hold the game back in non-traditional hockey markets. At the speed the game is played, it should be far more exciting but that would put an end to the want for parity...which is a killer for high-end talent.

3199 2018-06-03 17:32:07 Obama was a joke... his slow stock market growth was carried by big oil which he campaigned against..
3200 2018-06-03 17:32:03 Counsel, did we re-open or refinery at the Coast? or we are exporting the crude oil then we import the products?
3201 2018-06-03 17:31:59 Now now @SheilaGunnReid Isn’t exactly a journalist. She’s more like @Lauren_Southern selling snake oil in the naive way plebs do when they garner misplaced empathy for the consumer entitlement.
3202 2018-06-03 17:31:58 They have to track that oil,it may not reach its destination.Even if it does,they may find water inside instead!!That’s how I distrust these fellas!
3203 2018-06-03 17:31:57 honestly aloe vera deserves the same level of hype as coconut oil
3204 2018-06-03 17:31:54 Yes. CBD oil works best
3205 2018-06-03 17:31:50 @WilliamsSonoma , why is the @TylerFlorence olive oil only available for in store pick up only?

People had oil wells in their home, everyone had their own orchards where they grew grains, vegs, and fruits. People use to bath with milk
3211 2018-06-03 17:31:05 don’t trust people who say to put coconut oil in your mascara to make it work again...it ruins it
3212 2018-06-03 17:30:53 The excess inventory vanished rapidly, and even reversing cuts will not stop that trend in any meaningful way. If cuts are not reversed, however, oil prices will surge in July, later leading to a severe global recession, which impacts a few more BILLION people than your portfolio
3213 2018-06-03 17:30:49 You are moving fast, wait until the contracts for these oil ventures become public if ever they will.
3214 2018-06-03 17:30:47 I can’t take credit. @themanfronUNCLE posted it first.
3215 2018-06-03 17:30:31 Indeed, you wouldn't want 100, 000L of oil leaking out and contaminating the ground....
3216 2018-06-03 17:30:28 Came to Walmart for an oil change, leaving with having to buy two new tires 
3217 2018-06-03 17:30:22 Misleading the public is @MikeHudema job too.  Funded indirectly by BIG USA Oil and Gazprom.

3219 2018-06-03 17:30:04 I worked at Arby'a age 16 in Dayton, Ohio. We never changed the fryer oil. We also picked up food from GFS in Fairborn, OH. FROZEN and it thawed out many times. We then reheated heat. Managers promoted this practice. Still goes on. Most likely.  #FakeFrenchFriesFacts
3220 2018-06-03 17:29:39 Just close his oil veins and watch how bad he and his dogs will die and 80 million people will be free

3223 2018-06-03 17:29:16 Kenyan doesn't need oil to grow the economy.... we have enough money but in people's pockets!! 
Corruption, impunity and negligence is killing Kenya under your watch. Words without actions will take us nowhere.

3228 2018-06-03 17:28:44 Must we export oil only to import oil,  our leaders are really failing us and worst of all we are failing us
3229 2018-06-03 17:28:43 You could take some hop oil with you!
3230 2018-06-03 17:28:41 Well, for many centuries in the oil paint biz they've been grinding up lapis lazuli to get this color powder & they've always called it ultramarine. Maybe you should too?
3231 2018-06-03 17:28:40 So we are exporting oil now? And then we'll have to import it back? Jameni!
3232 2018-06-03 17:28:23 Why should we export crude oil while we still importing it??? MWENYE ALIROGA KENYA ALIKUFA AKI!!!

3234 2018-06-03 17:27:45 Where can I bathe and oil myself in a room full of candles, flowers and prayer?
3235 2018-06-03 17:27:35 100% and these have been one of the better NHL Playoffs in some time. Agreed on the old school elements but the Vegas story is one that has had almost everything break right for them. Not exactly a repeatable feat.

3237 2018-06-03 17:27:24 oil will end eventually , its a fact that need to be accepted , world will move on some rich guys get poor and new wealth rise again on new thing
3238 2018-06-03 17:27:06 Demonitisation and Gst made the public poor.gst and income tax collection high oil prices will make public more poorer.

3241 2018-06-03 17:26:31 It's the nuclear scientists he's after and some mini nuke bombs, b4 the US of A dismantle them for good..+ manpower for the rehab of Syria, in exchange of oil, pistachio nuts and dates fruit.
3242 2018-06-03 17:26:27 But how come crude oil for export is not using railway yet the mzungu you were condemnion June 1 constructed for you railway up to Kitale 100 years ago???
3243 2018-06-03 17:26:17 As we begin today transporting Oil from Lokichar, Turkana to Mombasa, we need to know it will take us one year to just fill One Oil Tanker. We will basically be exporting One Tanker per year! Nigeria exports 3m Barrels per day ....Kenyans shouldn’t build Castles in the Sky!

3253 2018-06-03 17:25:33 Oil exploration in Kenya will be a big step towards economic growth given its importance.However,the refining of it will make it competitive

It’s time to get ready for some Racing Springfield Raceway.
3258 2018-06-03 17:25:08 Long distance phone calls cost a lot.  Gas stations had people to fill your tank, check the oil and clean the windshield.
3259 2018-06-03 17:25:08 The problem with that argument is that there is a limited market for electricity. BC is building Site C, etc. Where will AB sell all that power? It's not like oil, where you can put in a pipeline and then a ship bound for Asia.
3260 2018-06-03 17:25:04 0 history, emptyhad and oil money. It's like I'm debating a fucking football memes account.
3261 2018-06-03 17:25:02 Good! On thursday I had a headache for pretty much no reason. Other than that my energy is up. I am getting some testing strips with the MCT oil on monday. So we will see how it is going for the actual ketosis.
3262 2018-06-03 17:24:53 we sell bricks.. oil base bricks.. fish scale bricks.. whole briccckkkkssss
3263 2018-06-03 17:24:51 Wow looks good!! So maybe poached in oil?
3264 2018-06-03 17:24:29 This I can agree with. The NHL is the only league that seems dedicated to holding superstars back, and limiting offense.
3265 2018-06-03 17:24:29 For sure and I get that but to be honest, there are just as many quality teams in the NBA as the NHL. The difference being, basketball is the one team sport that allows for a high-end individual talent to carry the collective. Can't do it in hockey. I'm a fan of both.
3266 2018-06-03 17:24:27 Nor will the fact City were a nothing club with zero history until the Arab oil money. The fan base then rose from 27 to 36 overnight. Lovely blue seats at the Emptyhad though.
3267 2018-06-03 17:24:24 I’m trying out this CBD oil for anxiety
3268 2018-06-03 17:24:18 My face is mad rude for producing this much oil
3269 2018-06-03 17:24:17 As well, specific refineries can handle heavy but not light crude. Refineries in Houston are watching Light Bakken Crude sail right by them because they can't refine it. They're configured for heavy crude from Venezuela & that supply has collapsed. Alberta oil is taking its place
3270 2018-06-03 17:24:14 Let me hope that the Crude Oil export launched by President Uhuru today in Lokichar won't be a project where Kenyan's "Hustler" number1 will ask his sycophants to carry money in sacks.

3277 2018-06-03 17:23:01 I called a car service that will pick up my car, take it to be inspected, get an oil change and go to the tax office to get it registered.

All for no additional costs.

It's mom. My mom is going to do my car stuff for logistics reasons.
3278 2018-06-03 17:22:58 It started with just putting it on my sunburnt chest but now I’m full blown addicted to coconut oil. Slather it all over my entire body every morning and lay in my bed pretending I’m in the Bahamas 
3279 2018-06-03 17:22:57 my hair loves oil. i can put any product under the sun on it and it will not work. until i put that oil blend on it, magic.
3280 2018-06-03 17:22:52 Turkana oil may open another door for corruption `processing services'
3281 2018-06-03 17:22:52 And are quite happy to ignore the fact that the oil and gas industry is foreign funded as well.  Foreign funded oil and gas lobbyists.
  CAPP is a half a step away from being foreign controlled.
3282 2018-06-03 17:22:42 Very true! But I also think we are watching something very special in the NHL playoffs this season - a bellwether of sorts. Vegas is what the Oilers tried to be & this success will make it easier for many teams to toss off the old school hockey elements that are out of touch.

3287 2018-06-03 17:22:22 Please; we have seen thousands of "anti oil activists and protesters" paid by CDN NGO's with money sent directly from US NGO's. Sauce for the goose!

They were originally known as greasy potatoes in oil, until the French invented the fryer. 
3291 2018-06-03 17:21:49 Also, on the whole, the NBA is far more fan-friendly than the NHL. IMO, the plan for every league should be to showcase its elite talent, not to go out of their way and help the underdog. Greatness stands the test of time.
3292 2018-06-03 17:21:42 upside is..all those who lose their jobs can be retrained in the alternative energy industry... look at all those abandoned oil wells that can be repurposed & used for the geothermal industry... solar/wind installation techs....
3293 2018-06-03 17:21:41 Crude oil dip benefit should be passed to the actual consumer not ujjwala and homes .Govt wud have already planned for that separately I believe
3294 2018-06-03 17:21:35 In a land far, far away, AKA Fort Bliss Texas, I went through a course that required an NDA.  After the paperwork was complete, one of the first things we were told was that "International Law grants the Right to Self-Defense"...Self defense cannot be denied.  The Left hates that

3296 2018-06-03 17:21:31 Highlighting the high school monologue our political parties partake in. How are you going to ensure that the people of NL can benefit from marijuana legalization? Have you considered how you can utilize this new industry to reduce our reliance on oil?
3297 2018-06-03 17:21:24 To retaliate PMJT should use all the Canadian steel to make pipelines and sell our oil at world prices.
3298 2018-06-03 17:21:15 Is without green. He calls the PM lays on D. He gets everyone is position. He's the oil that makes that engine run smoothly. Even on offense. He can handle the ball and make things happen. He gets more triple doubles than anyone on the team. He produces all around every night.

3300 2018-06-03 17:20:55 So it’s not a gift to allow companies like GE get away with not paying taxes and giving subsidies to the oil industry who have made record profits for years?
3301 2018-06-03 17:20:50 Because the technology doesn’t work. That’s why.
3302 2018-06-03 17:20:49 คุณทำให้ฉันยิ้มจนแก้มจะแตกล้าววววววววววว
3303 2018-06-03 17:20:47 Education me on this oil pull?
3304 2018-06-03 17:20:37 I do agree we will increase oil use for production only of meaningful products. We can no longer mass produce oil at increasing rates merely to waste it out out tail pipes in lineup for $2 Timmy’s. Or waste on single use plastics. If you don’t change, it’s going to get expensive!
3305 2018-06-03 17:20:32 Oh, if you enjoy, absolutely happy for you!
I've tried, and just can't get interested.  I just can't get interested in a league of a few constructed superteams against everyone else. Just feels like watching Olympic basketball when you already know who is going to win.
3306 2018-06-03 17:20:20 Sounds like a pretty awful night out  Nearly: Rapeseed/Butter & Cold pressed Rapeseed! Oil for heat & butter for colour

3308 2018-06-03 17:20:09 Interesting question, the point of the ‘where are you from’ jokes seems to me to be about tourist stereotypes & prejudice, the first I read was written by someone from Texas against the oil pumping 10 gallon hat prejudice. I wrote mine as I speak, against prejudice about Scotland

3311 2018-06-03 17:20:03 Save your selves from what? All American presidents have gone to war and usually just to steal oil trumps trying to get rid of nuclear weapons in North Korea but even if he did that people would still hate him.
3312 2018-06-03 17:20:03 They're all globalist - Bush in big oil - they d nothing abt NAFTA or China - they had to satisfy their donors who put them into office - Trump doesn't owe any1 - pd his own campaign.  Presidents going into office paid for.

3315 2018-06-03 17:19:47 I was pulling your leg. Have a good evening and good night's sleep and let's dream of oil and oil revenues. Nice week ahead.
3316 2018-06-03 17:19:33 So much stuff I already need to buy and when I took my car to the dealer to get my oil changed they told me it was time for some new tires 
3317 2018-06-03 17:19:32 They usually supply little sachets of a kind of oil cleanser with the strips. If not I'd think any oil based product would work.
3318 2018-06-03 17:19:17 I think the reason for trains is more history/culture/density in Europe, but it doesn't hurt that oil has been pretty cheap for a long time, making cars a pretty affordable option in the US.
3319 2018-06-03 17:19:16 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)

3322 2018-06-03 17:19:03 No, because he’s a snake oil salesman that is ruining the country. Nothing to do with race.
3323 2018-06-03 17:19:03 I think you could make money by offering a chain of real service stations where they pump gas & check the oil.
3324 2018-06-03 17:18:59 The neem oil and insecticide soap is organic and will do you know harm when you finally get around to eating your kale.
3325 2018-06-03 17:18:58 “There's no such thing as gas shortage man, its all set up by the government, everything's controlled by the oil companies like I heard about this guy who invented a car that runs on water man, its fiber glass, air cooled and it runs on water!”
3326 2018-06-03 17:18:57 Can someone give us a report on the status of Changamwe refinery plant. why did its operations stopped to an Extend we export Lokichar Oil to foreign countries
3327 2018-06-03 17:18:44 Deductions. All businesses get them,  oil and gas cook pants have large expenditures they get to deduct. They spend alot to make alot. Rick and reward. 
I only want a flat tax and gov funded political campaigns. No gov winters and losers.
3328 2018-06-03 17:18:43 This future must be properly managed otherwise it may just turn out to be a curse in disguise. Oil is a thorny and deadly issue in the Middle East, Nigeria just to mention a few. Stakeholders participation and involvement is crucial to sealing all risks around Oil business.
3329 2018-06-03 17:18:43 You keep asking the same question over and over, despite the fact that you've had your question answered.

Just admit that you're only here to troll.

3333 2018-06-03 17:18:03 Kanahus Manuel one of the loudest and nastiest voices against KMC grew up with her father at the tit of the gas and oil business with her father owning a gas station. I guess she must feel guilty.
3334 2018-06-01 23:59:49 Hillary didn't make a uranium deal.  Conspiracy theory created by right wingnuts. You know who did? Trump & Zinke, when they cut Bears Ear, a sacred tribal site, to sell rights to Uranium One & to oil companies to mine, drill & frack, destroying the area. That's the real scandal.

3345 2018-06-01 23:58:44 @JustinTrudeau Why did Trump impose steel sanctions on Canada? It's simple. He is mandated to create ripe markets for Russian steel, LNG, and oil exports. He was told to do this by entities that are blackmailing him. We are sorry!

Backward, lazy Muslims to erase western civilization and take all that we have built?

3383 2018-06-01 23:56:59 Where one barrel of oil fuelled extraction of >30, now ratio may be <1 to 5. Market is now at a point of 'Peak Consumption' & most insiders don't expect price to remain above $60/bbl. Why else would Saudi & Russia be selling ownership of state owned oil companies?

Yet still notice that ig is full of "Black woman is God" posts featuring nubile, nude, darkskinned women who would slide off concrete they used so much baby oil?
Be like, Grandmas aren't God?
3385 2018-06-01 23:56:57 This is why liberals and economics don't mix. Like oil and water. @realDonaldTrump cut taxes and there was still a record in the first quarter in government income (tax income).
3386 2018-06-01 23:56:54 In other early Nymex trading in December contracts, heating oil fractured 0.97 cent to $2.3945
3387 2018-06-01 23:56:47 And now the Republicans are back and time to increase profits for oil companies.

3394 2018-06-01 23:55:45 Solar & wind are so reliable that in Houston, TX oil capital, 40% of home plans are 100% solar and wind. I know cause I lived there and had them. 1200 jobs gained vs 9600 lost is Trump math that leads to bankruptcy.  Some business man, that tax cut is balloning the deficit.

You’re on the right path. We need to fine or take legal action against these companies that hire them#MAGA

3399 2018-06-01 23:55:24 That's why it rolled out now. Nothing fair or unbiased about this. The questions and timeline were decided with the NDP/ Green agreement last summer. This means more to Andrew Weaver than all the oil and gas in the world.
3400 2018-06-01 23:55:21 Your kind makes me nauseous for the future of this country when someone as egregiously corrupt as Pruitt is characterized as a hero for dismantling such an important public watchdog in return for oil and coal industry kickbacks and profits.

3419 2018-06-01 23:52:50 Plus oil companies are another reason we dont have hydrogen cars.
3420 2018-06-01 23:52:11 Be patient! Big Oil can see the end coming and they are going to rip us off for all they can get before that happens.
3421 2018-06-01 23:52:10 Coconut oil is the answer to all of your problems.
3422 2018-06-01 23:52:06 @mikewaid I tried your beard oil at Hair Genius today. Really good stuff - how do I get my hands on more?

3426 2018-06-01 23:50:53 Is that a more beautiful sight than a sold out Lucas Oil?
3427 2018-06-01 23:50:18 Vitamin E oil is working wonders for my skin
3428 2018-06-01 23:50:03 Cetaphils sensitive skin! Also my mom started mixing witch hazel and tea tree oil for me (2:1)  as a toner and buh bye dry skin!!
3429 2018-06-01 23:49:38 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
3430 2018-06-01 23:49:13 Tell me what's naive about it? I've got my job back since oil went up to $70 a barrel and 3 buddies of mine are back working. Don't tell me what's naive if you aren't down here  in the gulf working.

3433 2018-06-01 23:48:57 Never new much about the coconut nutrients till l watched a documentary,  from the oil, to the water, to the nut itself to the tree, to the sell, e. t. c wow! Ve really underrated coconut
3434 2018-06-01 23:48:53 Yeah, but the Doobie Brothers is a great band. There’s enough oil in the Permian basin to cover the costs. I say it was worth it.
3435 2018-06-01 23:48:45 That ouai oil is so good. I’m obsessed
3436 2018-06-01 23:48:38 Try to avoid washing your hair everyday. Constant shampooing leaves hair and skin dry and will increase oil production to overcompensate.
3437 2018-06-01 23:48:32 Honda makes weed eaters now. More expensive but runs great. No mixing gas and oil
3438 2018-06-01 23:48:31 Oh yah? Canada just bought a pipeline to ensure we get our oil to China. Trump is driving your allies to trade with Russia and China instead of you.
3439 2018-06-01 23:48:14 Apple vinegar or oatmeal bath as well and then rub small amount coconut oil on

3445 2018-06-01 23:47:16 @DineshDSouza would you look into the kinder Morgan pipeline of Canada and how the Chinese have a 60% interest in energy here. We will be shipping most of our oil to fuel chinas economy because Trudeau has bought the pipeline.

3449 2018-06-01 23:46:57 Another moron who absolutely does no research. This month alone he brought in another 200,000 + jobs. Oil production is making us energy independent. He signed two important pardons (Barack didn't have the courage to do) That's just last couple of days
3450 2018-06-01 23:46:55 Thank you! It has turned into a yearly thing, but I ruined it last year, so we're really looking forward to this trip. Last year, I burned my thumb in a kitchen oil fire and we had to come home early to go to the burn center. It was just a dumb accident.
3451 2018-06-01 23:46:52 They are not writing as honest researchers. They are a megaphone for the #RealEstate industry. But they are discrediting the whole @UBC because they sound like a snake oil salesmen, but NOBODY BELIEVES THEM

3457 2018-06-01 23:46:16 The political uproar surrounding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s decision to buy an oil pipeline to ensure its expansion echoes a famous moment in Canada’s past.
3458 2018-06-01 23:46:14 とても嬉しい。ありがとうございます…。
3459 2018-06-01 23:46:14 I'm sorry to hear that! My friend had amazing results giving his cats cannabis oil for cancer and kidney disease.
3460 2018-06-01 23:46:13 The political uproar surrounding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s decision to buy an oil pipeline to ensure its expansion echoes a famous moment in Canada’s past.
3461 2018-06-01 23:46:10 i was at walmart looking for cooking oil and i saw a man wearing a construction uniform w a navy blue polo thinking he works here so i asked where i could find the oil and he looks around and says, “u may want to try aisle 15, but i’m just a construction worker what do i know” 
3462 2018-06-01 23:46:06 Worked a 9 hour day came home cleaned the house then changed my oil in my car and now about to cook dinner. Its almost like I live alone the shitty part is I don’t wheres the helpppp

3466 2018-06-01 23:45:34 For who? Just you or for all involved!!
Canada is your greatest trading partner and you call us spoiled?!
How about market value for all the NAFTA subsidized oil you buy!!
I suggest seeing a shrink! Maybe it's early dementia kicking in!
3467 2018-06-01 23:45:29 Canada wants to sell oil to China with the KM pipeline expansion
3468 2018-06-01 23:45:11 In addition to other seasonings use Turmeric powder. It’s a healthy spice, very beneficial. Also, sauté some onions and fresh chopped garlic and parsley in olive oil before mixing the rice. You need a good quality jasmine rice as well.
3469 2018-06-01 23:45:07 Get out there and see them now before they are sold off for oil and mining rights. Time is running out.
3470 2018-06-01 23:45:05 I’ve been there a few times for oil and a battery but this just seems way wrong.
3471 2018-06-01 23:44:54 Every time I go get an oil change 
3472 2018-06-01 23:44:48 My jar of coconut oil has turned to pure liquid. I need an AC ASAP.
3473 2018-06-01 23:44:46 Haley said cocoa butter and coconut oil
3474 2018-06-01 23:44:45 If @jjhorgan was really concerned about oil spills he should ban all the unescorted, unpiloted single hulled oil barges delivering fuel to Vancouver Island every week.
3475 2018-06-01 23:44:44 What stupidity, to appease his oil/gas donors by throwing money at a dying energy source. Retrain coal miners for clean energy jobs now!
3476 2018-06-01 23:44:37 Maybe we should produce BETTER sedans, or LESS EXPENSIVE sedans or another product that other countries also want. Doesn’t your state make a fair bit of money off oil and pays no state income tax? You just want me to buy inferior quality products because they are made here?
3477 2018-06-01 23:44:37 Gas prices are climbing. $488 per gallon in California (mainly because of their stupid environmental). Oil is at $60+ a barrel.  West Texas oil companies are making money at $45 per barrel. You don’t know what you are talking about.
3478 2018-06-01 23:44:36 I don’t agree with the tactics used but one ‘survivor’ of this scandal has admitted at the enquiry back in 2016 that she and her group were openly planning the destruction of an oil refinery in Wales it was prevented by the undercover team, so does the end justify the means?
3479 2018-06-01 23:44:35 それな…。大きい会社ほど大変そうだ
3480 2018-06-01 23:44:06 Don’t forget to do routine oil changes! It keeps the motor healthy
3481 2018-06-01 23:43:46 TLは頑張って見てるつもりではあるんですよ。断片的に。
フォロワーの「好き」くらい知っておきたいっていう気持ち。まぁ何かするわけではないんですけど
3482 2018-06-01 23:43:45 While Ca has oil, it need US to refine that oil. See how this works... better to not be to cocky! Better to come to an agreement that benefits both!!!!
3483 2018-06-01 23:43:39 Dad took my car to his work and cleaned it, change oil, fix the damage that @ItsPapaDa did and cleaned the stains of salt in the car...
3484 2018-06-01 23:43:38 U can't compare d US with Nigeria u are learned dan dis. How many factories are in Nigeria? Nigeria is dependent on only Oil & nothing more, Us has a stable power supply so people cud generate income for themselves, Nigeria does nt have dat in place
3485 2018-06-01 23:43:34 What the heck did kodaka tweet about Detroit. I put it through google translate and it said something about an arab oil king
3486 2018-06-01 23:43:31 @BWWings Can I get a follow?
3487 2018-06-01 23:43:29 So the tax code shouldn't apply to oil and gas ?  I think provinces like Newfoundland shouldn't get equalization payments. Encouraging failure.  I guess Trudeau could use that money to give to bombardier or the CBC. Welfare losers. Or a convicted terrorist ? Buy a pipeline ?
3488 2018-06-01 23:43:28 (Sigh) the dollar is weaker. Period. That’s why.  The oil market is priced in dollars, so everyone buys and sells in dollars. The oil sheiks get paid in U.S. dollars, so if the dollar goes down in value, they need more dollars to receive the same value.  Get it? #gasprices
3489 2018-06-01 23:43:27 Heat the pan on the stove with oil, roll the chuck generously in Plain flour add to pan & brown (don’t be shy), when nearly done add the veg to fry a bit then add stock. Stir to get the bits off the bottom of the pan then add tonnes tomatoes & stir
3490 2018-06-01 23:43:12 Well Canada does have oil
3491 2018-06-01 23:42:33 well said! so many people underestimate this number, we need to move away from the oil and coal industry and more towards renewable energy sources to save our planet. #es161

3493 2018-06-01 23:41:59 From an oil company that would love for this to be the case, and has plenty more money than whoever gave the scientist the grant.
3494 2018-06-01 23:41:47 nooo a lot of karijan love it it just has so much oil in it I can’t
3495 2018-06-01 23:41:29 my favorite kind of oil, Central Business District Oil
3496 2018-06-01 23:41:28 ちょっとびっくりした…いい意味で…
今まで無いと思ってた人に反応を示されるととても嬉しくなりますよね。ね。
3497 2018-06-01 23:41:26 Well said.  I wish the MPs would ask for the pipeline East and ask why we are allowing Paul Martin and sons to continue to import Saudi oil.  Are we OPEC or Canada.  Until we have an answer in parliment it means they are ALL corupt.
3498 2018-06-01 23:41:19 THIS. YES. 
Fish oil, caffeine, creatine - all impermissible. Shoot, we even used to be limited in the amount (%) of protein we could provide to athletes at any given time. 

Lots of regulations to navigate between fair practice & evidence based practice. But. Thems the rules 
3499 2018-06-01 23:41:09 This is a pretty good show for people who invest in oil and gas securities. A little technical improvement is all that's needed.
3500 2018-06-01 23:40:38 not sure if you also noticed, oil companies are investing in this renewable energy as there is far bigger profit to be made
you people demonize FF companies when it suits you, "they're just in it for the huge amount of profit" but when they invest in "renewables"oh they're great

3504 2018-06-01 23:40:19 It’s pretty much the type of foods that are easier to keep down as opposed to the spice / oil heavy foods. Eat anything too rich it might try to come out again

3512 2018-06-01 23:39:20 Give the world a break with this foolishness.  A 10 yr old can catch trump and his team in their own lies, conflicts, changing stories.  They are attacking our allies, press, citizens, intel, decency with help from people like you.  Snake oil salesman is accurate.
3513 2018-06-01 23:39:20 I've worked with oil Executives in the past, and if there's one thing I know, they are "summoned" by no one.

They are CEOs, held to account for their profits. They may meet with the Pope, but it won't make an ounce of difference to them. 

Most are assholes.

3547 2018-06-01 23:35:39 I believe the Queen is Pope of the Anglican Church... the Anglican Church is burning the oil if anyone. Churches are empty in UK and most of EU...the void is now being filled.
3548 2018-06-01 23:35:20 I wish I could offer insight to what helps. The only thing I found that lessens the pain at all is cbp oil that has no thc in it. Last month was the first I used it and it was the first time I was able to stand up on my period with out bawling my eyes out in a long time.
3549 2018-06-01 23:34:55 My new favourite Twitter Idiot is the type who firmly believes that if you have ever used oil or gas or its byproducts, in any way, you cannot voice a negative opinion about that industry.  #LifeInAPetrostate

3552 2018-06-01 23:34:38 yeah! I was learning about chiaroscuro, which is an old oil technique, but i put a spin on ‘traditional’ style by incorporating a ‘contemporary’ subject and using contemporary media! that was the basis of the project.
3553 2018-06-01 23:34:31 I want my friend to go into labor, help me pls she won’t drink castor oil  but I need this little girl to come out I wanna meet her
3554 2018-06-01 23:34:24 For the past couple of years, I’ve been ordering pizza win an olive oil base with spinach and peppers.  Palmist never get a meat, except grilled chicken every once in a while.

Trying to cut back on calories & processed meats where it’s easy.
3555 2018-06-01 23:34:16 Is there a place on Guam where you can get aromatic oils???? There used to be one at ASC but that was YEARS ago and I want to get oil for our warmer we have
3556 2018-06-01 23:33:39 How, is it about oil? Some what yes. But more so about the petrodollar. The world goes by the value of the US dollar, and righty so. Some are and have tried to change that. Even China in recent times. You want the value of the US dollar to fall? Then inflation would take over.
3557 2018-06-01 23:33:36 ちょっとなにいってるかわからない

3560 2018-06-01 23:33:01 37 elements per dish? 12 of them finishing salts and truffle oil? That would be a ballache.
3561 2018-06-01 23:32:50 I also made time to stop and get my baby’s oil changed. An auto place had a sign that caught my eye, and I did right instead of claiming an excuse and waiting until the worst again. I’m proud of myself  It felt good
3562 2018-06-01 23:32:24 I really just saw someone say canola oil is high in omega 3s... omega 6 and 3s are not the same thing....
3563 2018-06-01 23:32:22 US oil exports hit another record high in May. Displacing Angolan & Nigerian producers. Congrats!@algore @BillNye @JayInslee @NaomiAKlein

3574 2018-06-01 23:31:04 I've a big pot of spaghetti on the hob plus some chopped onions in olive oil that'll soon be joined by a tin of chopped tomatoes. When the Linda McCartney's veggie sausages in the oven are done they'll be chopped up, added to the toms/onions and then to the spaghetti. Ready..?
3575 2018-06-01 23:30:43 There *is* a plan: kill US solar industry, fulfill Robert Murray's wish list, keep MAGA angry, drive up oil price to help Rosneft, build soundproof rooms, order pens, crash economy, scoop up cheap real estate, get booted out, wait 8 years, do it again. So. Much. To. Do!
3576 2018-06-01 23:30:30 Plus it was from saje so it was a legit oil 
3577 2018-06-01 23:30:28 GO TO THE STORE AND BUY SOME FOR YOURSELVES.' SO THE FOOLISH ONES WENT OFF TO BUY SOME OIL; AND WHILE THEY WERE GONE, THE BRIDEGROOM ARRIVED.

3584 2018-06-01 23:30:00 Oh man time’s have changed. I knew from last summer after tanning when I got brown spots. This year tanning hasn’t went well. What happened to when I could bask in the sun  with baby oil? This year I have too many skin sensitivities I can’t even tan. #sunscreenparabenfree
3585 2018-06-01 23:29:52 That hot oil treatment was so rewarding.
3586 2018-06-01 23:29:40 @NicoDujovne una propuesta. Bajar el precio del gas oil comun sustancialmente.(30%) No las naftas ni el infinia. Se va a producir una explosion productiva, sin precedentes. Campo industria transporte

3588 2018-06-01 23:29:26 Russia gets the soybean contract with China. Sorry American farmers. Russian oil sells thanks to Iranian sanctions. Canada and Mexico are National security threats. WTF America. It’s time for Biff to clean Marty’s car.
3589 2018-06-01 23:29:22 Yes they did. Washington State is hooked on discount Canadian oil for its Salish Sea refinery complex. Anyone who buys the @GovInslee drivel - there is also land going at bargain prices down in Hanford, WA.

 It’s amazing how for *profit wars arranged for private, 0% taxpaying, global oil companies, happen in far off exotic locations by “serendipitous” meetings 
The bill? Taxpayers
3592 2018-06-01 23:28:38 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
3593 2018-06-01 23:28:18 How some other info I have seen from several different outlets report that Iran has for some years attempting to run a oil pipeline up thru Syria to Turkey. And Iran wanted to change their oil from being traded in US dollars as so many in the region use to their own currency.
3594 2018-06-01 23:28:15 Awesome,  need more news like this to counter bad media about Tesla from paid oil lobbies
3595 2018-06-01 23:28:06 Shitty news week for greenies like myself: Trump coal bailout, Kinder oil sands, big China CO2 increase, DRC opening up Congo rainforest to logging etc. Appears we are at the freeze-dried Han/amputee Luke chapter of the #climateresistance saga.
3596 2018-06-01 23:27:59 I’ve never had a bee sting, but I’m pretty sure coconut oil helps with literally everything.
3597 2018-06-01 23:27:50 More global warming means more permafrost melting in the oil fields of Siberia. Putin's strategy is long term.

3613 2018-06-01 23:25:37 I know that feeling...and it works with trucks, too.  I can change the oil & grease the chassis on my truck and just need to wash my hands...but if I break out the pressure washer to clean the truck, I'll need a head-to-toe scrub down myself.
3614 2018-06-01 23:25:31 My only concern with the law is that it may open up snake oil salesmen and other quacks to prey on people at their most desperate.
3615 2018-06-01 23:25:30 "Hey Ben!  Remember that time they court-martial'd you?  Look, here it is!"  Practically pouring whale oil on the fire.
3616 2018-06-01 23:25:24 I want to share something I read
 There is a fish oil, a particular one, called Skate fish or rat fish. You can order off of Wal-Mart. It helps you to decalcify your pineal gland. Basically gets the junk out and allows you to think clearly
3617 2018-06-01 23:25:16 It also boosts transit usage and encourages more sustainable transportation. The real question is should the extra money go the big oil companies or to help people?

I don't generalize, but it's pretty common. Lawyers and cops are like oil & water. But, I never lost a case.

3634 2018-06-01 23:21:35 So when Obama wanted BP to help the Govt pay for their oil spill, he “had his boot on the neck of BP” according to GOP.

3639 2018-06-01 23:21:06 Dad, what does Feckless mean.
Son, Feckless would be when an anti-regulation, pro-oil Republican Senate Candidate in an oil state, wakes up to find the Koch Brothers are funding a media blitz for his Democratic opponent. The proper usage would be Feckless Cramer.
3640 2018-06-01 23:21:02 Much in the same way that the US shrinking its dependence on foreign oil reduces those political problems, reducing US growers dependence on exploiting foreign workers would reduce THOSE political problems as well.

3645 2018-06-01 23:20:38 I need to go shopping, get an oil change and sleep for 30 years. All before my trip in 2 weeks lmao
3646 2018-06-01 23:20:36 Hey Margaret, Just came back in from watering my raised bed gardens.  Tomorrow we will have fresh lettuce, and a nice mix of onion, tomato, basil and olive oil.  The best salads!  Is it a good drive today, or are the asshats in big supply?
3647 2018-06-01 23:20:23 Hmm I'll have to research this using my 26 volume encyclopedia. Speaking of which, does anyone know some whale oil salesmen? I don't trust "electricity" to make my light and I don't know what kerosene is.

3654 2018-06-01 23:19:08 Probably only important in the consumers mind more than reality. Important to me is that major oil companies can see the writing on the wall and looking no looking at how to be a part of the future
3655 2018-06-01 23:19:06 Wait till he tastes it especially with normal oil
3656 2018-06-01 23:19:06 Of course they are allies. What happens at night or when there is no wind? Any wind/solar kW must have its gas/oil equivalent.

3658 2018-06-01 23:18:46 Everyone in the UK should read this no matter their politics, how Scotland was screwed over but didn't know it, I only read McCrone report a few years ago, SNP need to make more of this & the re drawing of the maritime line to include Scottish oil wells in English waters
3659 2018-06-01 23:18:36 Glen, I’m not involved in oil. The argument is more complex than a single tweet. Look at my previous and then comment pls.   Just disappointed in those who are anti oil at all costs. Seems like they want cessation without understanding what that truly means.
3660 2018-06-01 23:18:29 Its been proven that marijuana oil, the venom of certain American pit vipers (most notably rattlesnakes and copperheads), and the venom of certain bees and scorpions have been known to dissolve cancerous tumors
3661 2018-06-01 23:18:10 But we have wheat, dairy, oil wine and beer...overall a good week!
3662 2018-06-01 23:17:48 Oil change as soon as I got here 
3663 2018-06-01 23:17:38 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for a vegetarian diet, and put some lemongrass essential oil in my diffuser.
3664 2018-06-01 23:17:22 lol that’s the oil they put on your cuticles 
3665 2018-06-01 23:17:20 THE FOOLISH ONE TOOK THEIR LAMPS BUT DID NOT TAKE ANY EXTRA OIL WITH THEM, WHILE THE WISE ONES TOOK CONTAINERS FULL OF OIL FOR THEIR LAMPS. THE BRIDEGROOM WAS LATE IN COMING, SO THEY BEGAN TO NOT AND FALL ASLEEP.
3666 2018-06-01 23:17:14 ....and hope there is oil beneath them all!
3667 2018-06-01 23:17:10 Google games I like:
1. Search for DIY home colonoscopy kit on Google. Then drive to New Balance store and buy USA Made shoes.
2. Google hair braiding for arm pits. Then go to Autozone and buy oil and filters for my John Feer tractor. 

Keeps the search engines guessing 
3668 2018-06-01 23:17:08 At one point separating sand from oil was a  huge energy expense too.
3669 2018-06-01 23:16:49 Guess the bromance between Trudeau and Trump spawned by dreams of oil profits has gone sour over steel tariffs.
3670 2018-06-01 23:16:48 i stood in my room for 40 mins COVERED in oil and not a scrap of tan came off me hahahahahaha biggest waste of time ever

3673 2018-06-01 23:16:42 Well your the one that brought up “how long does it take to to recharge the battery”. But yes I get we can’t survive without oil. But that doesn’t mean with cars. Now maybe yes. But not in the future

No se haria cargo de la refineria pero si de abastecer por intermedio de la firma Dapsa a red de estaciones Oil
3678 2018-06-01 23:15:44 I was joking, but we do come across the occasional patient who is taking 1/4 c of coconut oil every day because they heard it's good for them. That's no joke!
3679 2018-06-01 23:15:41 Check your Transmission oil today.
3680 2018-06-01 23:15:40 Local establishment knowing I loathe myself & how snake oil susceptible I am to automatically not give me the toast, though
3681 2018-06-01 23:15:08 I accidentally put lime cordial in the pan instead of olive oil and i dont regret it
3682 2018-06-01 23:14:57 just bought a lip oil and my lips are soft as ever omg 
3683 2018-06-01 23:14:48 THE PARABLE OF THE TEN YONG WOMEN
"AT THAT TIME THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN  WILL BE LIKE THIS. 
ONCE THERE WERE TEN YOUNG WOMEN WHO TOOK THEIR OIL LAMPS AND WENT OUT TO MEET THE BRIDEGROOM. 
FIVE OF THEM WERE FOOLISH, ANT THE OTHER FIVE WERE WISE.
3684 2018-06-01 23:14:47 Charging time? Convenience of refueling is a big thing between the two. Parallel and series formats are just the way the batteries are wired together. Advanced countries use oil is what I'm saying. Without oil, you wouldn't have the structures you live in
3685 2018-06-01 23:14:27 In the olden days, mayonnaise was an excellent substitute for eggs. Like applesauce instead of oil or milk with vinegar for sour milk.
3686 2018-06-01 23:13:59 ‘Who you with’ ‘gbs oil’
3687 2018-06-01 23:13:56 This olive oil ain’t virgin anymore lol
3688 2018-06-01 23:13:47 Burning the midnight oil with my team, planing one heck of a shoot!

3692 2018-06-01 23:13:24 Im always proud of you brother. You're a winner!!!  I'm glad you had some good grilling. A simple sauce for fish is: a garlic, olive oil red onion, citrus mix. It’s made with sour oranges (available at Latino groceries) but you can mix fresh OJ and lime juice with good results.
3693 2018-06-01 23:13:19 As long as it's not full of artificial crap, it's fine.  Eggs, oil, and vinegar/lemon juice all go into the cake anyway, so may as well use them pre-combined.
3694 2018-06-01 23:13:16 I’m convinced that coconut oil is actual magic in a jar.
3695 2018-06-01 23:13:06 The larger question is that do we need to have there oil and chemical refineries spewing venomous smog in a city so fraught with pollution like mumbai. I think that there should be a movement to move these refineries as well as RCF out of mumbai..
3696 2018-06-01 23:13:06 CONTRARY TO BELIEF

YOU DO NOT NEED A LOT OF COOKING OIL TO HAVE FOOD NOT STICK

a little goes a long way

3697 2018-06-01 23:13:06 But my un-knowledgeable friend, we have some things that are very important the EU will be delighted to have...seas where Spain etc fish, oil and renewable energy to die for. Tell me again we won't be welcome....?

3700 2018-06-01 23:12:59 Tesla is eating the business of all fuel based cars (Read traditional car makers and oil companies). Also, what would America do, if they don't have to fight wars for Oil anymore (Read gun lobby et al).
3701 2018-06-01 23:12:26 Por favor, que tal si redactamos como corresponde, no sera que "la justicia resolvio que Oil quede a cargo de YPF"...bah, se me ocurre, vió!!
3702 2018-06-01 23:12:20 No we are fucking not. No Iranian oil means my gas is 5.80 a gallon and now beer is going up because fucknuts is playing tariff wars. 

Bill would be banging Russians in Russia and with a nuclear cock and we'd be better for it.
3703 2018-06-01 23:12:08 It’s just oil, eggs, and a little acid for tartness. You’ll be fine.
3704 2018-06-01 23:12:04 Still wise to get out to your spot early because I would say they will close the roads to avoid risk of more oil spills. Don't care what time they start as long as it safe day
3705 2018-06-01 23:11:53 “Where are you from?”
“Turkey.”
“Where in Turkey?”
“Aydın”
“Where’s that near”
“Kuşadası”
“Huhh?”
“İzmir. It’s close to İzmir. Yes we always eat ÇİĞDEM and also drink olive oil while looking Atatürk’s photo. We clean everywhere with using KLORAK. ONUNCU YIL MARŞI. LAİKLİK OKAY??”
3706 2018-06-01 23:11:44 For sure. This is why there should be no pipeline and Canada should grow some balls, create jobs, and sell refined oil
3707 2018-06-01 23:11:27 Bill Clinton pardoned Mark Rich who was indicted on 65 criminal counts, including income tax evasion, wire fraud, racketeering, and trading with Iran during the oil embargo. Who's wife gave a huge amount of money to the Clintons. Pay for play.
3708 2018-06-01 23:11:27 I think I tried just using glazes at first but then had to give in and mix. I may have actually just mixed Nuln Oil in instead of black. Pre thins it kind of

3711 2018-06-01 23:11:18 I hear and feel you!  Valor essential oil is amazing with the tension.  I use Young Living Essential Oils but I’m sure there are others!  One of it’s uses: TMJ.  I was so hesistant but tried it and now I won’t be without it 
3712 2018-06-01 23:11:14 And the oil outpost Of Israel will spread UAE practice? I am responsible for the shooting death of the Nazi war criminal in Sth Australia and return of Nazi stockpiled paintings in Europe. Cash in chips. Free Latifa.
3713 2018-06-01 23:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: undercooked crust with damp coconut oil and egg.
3714 2018-06-01 23:11:07 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
3715 2018-06-01 23:10:55 Yeah that’s when I took mine off when it was all mouldy looking hahahahaha I also did it in the shower like applied the layer of oil while in the shower and washed it off with shower gel and a sponge
3716 2018-06-01 23:10:45 Alhamdulillah
3717 2018-06-01 23:10:43 Rather than throw labels, why don’t you try and enter into a conversation regarding it? Explain to me, why Trump can say the word, why his followers can, but a comedian can’t?
3718 2018-06-01 23:10:29 I came to get an oil change and sat in the lobby watching makeup tutorials and I kept wondering why I couldn't hear anything, then the mechanic came up to me and asked "is that Jaclyn hill?" My Bluetooth was connected to my car..
3719 2018-06-01 23:10:26 .@SecretaryZinke Couldn't you have hired just 1 person who wasn't corrupt & tied to SCI, the NRA, Heritage, Trumps campaign, Koch Industries, oil/gas/mining lobbying, Whitefish or your SOFA PAC? Just one? Just one natural resources person who didn't have a dismal reputation? 3/3

3721 2018-06-01 23:10:10 I seriously think it’s the sensor. I took it in for an oil change last week, but I just don’t want to chance it.
3722 2018-06-01 23:09:59 oil based paint is gods creation, in that statistically most of gods creations suck ass so he probably made that too

The French?Prior to them after selling Iraq’s oil or after and during the sanctions ?
3725 2018-06-01 23:09:29 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
3726 2018-06-01 23:09:24 I'm not against improving cultures. I don't agree the oil and gas industries is the way to go about it but a 65 year old dilbit pipeline expansion/twinning sure got ur attention and pulled the fur right over for ya didn't it? This is how they make us all suffer in the long run.
3727 2018-06-01 23:09:20 2 ) كلامي. هل تقدر تقول ليش المحكمة  العليا في امريكا قررت تفكيك شركة standard oil  في سنة 1911 وهل ما حدث يصح في بلد ديمقراطي وأين العدل هذا هذي القضيه ؟ كذلك اين العدالة في قضية دريد سكوت وما الذي يبرر حكم المحكمة العليا للولايات المتحدة ضده سنة 1857 ؟ أيضا هل ما حصل للسيدة
3728 2018-06-01 23:09:15 CBD oil is my new best friend.  Knees haven’t felt this good in years.
3729 2018-06-01 23:09:14 Let's invert that because it's a shorter list. The only thing that might possibly be right with it is the pastry, but it's contaminated with fish oil.... So no. Just no.
3730 2018-06-01 23:09:08 My hair smells so good when I wash it with olive oil shampoo 
3731 2018-06-01 23:09:06 Lapis lazuli has a porous structure which is why it also works so well as a paint pigment with various binders oil tempera or water
3732 2018-06-01 23:09:00 Listen I am SO allergic to poison that I develop massive yellow blisters. Poison is an allergic reaction to the oil(s) on the plant's leaves, if you hadn't known, that comes as blisters and/or a red rash. That being said, the only time you can spread it is after initial contact..
3733 2018-06-01 23:09:00 Ok but I have an actual unpopular opinion which is I prefer the bland cheap processed olive oil to the super fragrant unprocessed extra virgin and yes I am ashamed.
3734 2018-06-01 23:08:46 The oil in her skin can be used in fryng plantain or akara

3741 2018-06-01 23:08:02 The Saudi's have something called OIL or else they would be just as backwards as the Palestinians. And you're so cool with the catch phrase Zionist. I'm just a non-religious Jew from NY.  The Jews are allowed to have a majority country just like Muslims and Christians, Mr. Hater
3742 2018-06-01 23:07:57 Way too kind, there are ass cheeks in the air ready for Trump to summit like he was Edmund Hillary ready to explore for oil on Everest.

3753 2018-06-01 23:05:49 Unfortunately it's not just the U.S.. The Canadian government has just decided to purchase a $4.5B, non economically viable oil pipeline. Socializing risks, privatizing profits. #TYTLive

3761 2018-06-01 23:04:46 Perhaps Alicia if you were to become informed and not stay in an alternate reality, you would understand how the rest of the world sees Trump as a snake oil salesmen, a lying conman and morally corrupt! We are all awake and realize our democracy is crumbling everyday!

3770 2018-06-01 23:03:45 Exactly!! We just had that for dinner two nights ago, and I almost went after a kid for trying to shuck it before we'd nuked it. The only other way I like it is marinated in lime juice, olive oil, and cayenne before grilling. But that's not even a little bit convenient.

3799 2018-06-01 23:01:16 Oh! And I should add that once you start shampooing less (and with sulfate-free shampoo), that your scalp might be a bit oily for a little bit. If you’ve been drying it out constantly with harsh shampoos, it’ll produce more oil to compensate.   :)
3800 2018-06-01 23:01:13 It grasps the taste of whatever you cook it with! So this was cooked in a bit of oil, hot sauce, onion and garlic, cayenne, and soy sauce :) I like it firm and either baked or fried

3823 2018-06-01 22:59:23 When all the oil is going to fuel the military ... you’ll be glad to have some coal still around. Or maybe you think we will never have another global war. But since it’s not your job to prepare ... let’s be honest about how much you know about it.
3824 2018-06-01 22:59:07 I haven’t been to a BP gas station since the oil spill

3826 2018-06-01 22:59:01 Which, of course, could be easily resolved with some 3 in 1 oil, gauze pads, and antifreeze. It was all ball bearings in those days.
3827 2018-06-01 22:58:59 It definitely can. Like others in this thread I have an old family recipe that uses it in place of eggs and oil for a chocolate cake (flavored with cocoa.) It's very moist. Don't know about adding it to other cakes.
3828 2018-06-01 22:58:57 Drown them in petroleum. Hang them from oil wells. Shoot them with... guns? I guess not all just executions can be fitting.

3865 2018-06-01 22:55:06 Let us ask Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell if they agree with this idea. My sense is that Koch Bros (and Big Oil) will throw a fit and make them stop it, if it ever gets that far. Bros are already very upset about the tariffs.

3868 2018-06-01 22:54:45 Oh so using constant gasoline, and the US spending billions on oil isn’t doing the earth wrong? And what are you talking about can’t refuel in 3 min. There is recharging stations all over the place and they are becoming more common than ever.

3884 2018-06-01 22:52:10 I agree. Only in Canada do we bend over and take one when people disrespect our laws, breaking and ignoring them, and knowing those with authority will do nothing. But heaven help a P/L company if they spill a teacup of oil #cdnpoli #TransMountainPipeline

3913 2018-06-01 22:48:08 Look, if you're trying to say that experts often can't properly estimate the amount of oil in world reserves, that's a valid point but nevertheless, oil is still finite.

3953 2018-06-01 22:42:12 Heya, very simple - score the LJ 2 or 3 times, squeeze of lemon juice, lather with olive oil and bbq for 2 - 3 mins each side - more lemon juice to serve.
Enjoy
3954 2018-06-01 22:41:53 @chipfranklin the oil used to break in baseball gloves is mink oil. Not sure if it's still sold.
3955 2018-06-01 22:41:51 Oil money flowing into the UK and historical geo-political ties.
3956 2018-06-01 22:41:50 These factors are a non-trivial driver of the wave of automation in the oil and gas industry.
3957 2018-06-01 22:41:38 @AriMelber @TheBeatWithAri @robreiner @Scaramucci
Middle class tax cuts are going back to the oil companies as artificially inflated gas prices. #TheBeat
3958 2018-06-01 22:41:35 Here's an idea charge the rest of the world prices for oil and gas
3959 2018-06-01 22:41:30 #askethanandgrayson if corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables. Wat is baby oil made from ?   
3960 2018-06-01 22:41:27 Trudeau’s plan worked- there will never be one drop of oil expansion- ever.
3961 2018-06-01 22:41:19 With bourbon instead of olive oil and sugar instead of parmesan...
3962 2018-06-01 22:41:13 ลองซื้อ rosehip oil ของ the ordinary มาใช้ ฟีลลิ่งเหมือนเอาน้ำมันพืชมาทาหน้าเลยอะ :O ถ้าไม่นับเรื่องนั้นนางก็โออยุ่ จากหน้าแห้งเป็นกระดาษทรายคือกลายเป็นดิวอี้ชั่วข้ามคืน แต่ทาตอนเช้าก็พังไปหน่อยหน้าเงาประหนึ่งเพิ่งทอดไข่เจียวเส็ด 55555
3963 2018-06-01 22:41:12 Has anyone use the black castor oil eco styling gel?
3964 2018-06-01 22:41:11 Oil Combustibles era de Cristóbal Lopez, socio de Tinelli, pensar q éste último le hizo publicidad dentro de su programa Showmatch, seguro tenía acciones tmb, q oscuro todo, ah pasó a manos de YPF x orden del juez
3965 2018-06-01 22:41:10 can you believe they literally spent a good minute and a half talking about vegetable oil and cooking spray
3966 2018-06-01 22:41:07 Some day, I agree, but until all cars are electric (and the electricity generation grid can support all that capacity with renewables), oil will be necessary for gasoline #tytlive #BuyCanadian #shutcoalplants
3967 2018-06-01 22:41:07 I think if you put 2 cups of coconut oil in there it should be able to run no problem for another 5000 miles
3968 2018-06-01 22:41:02 Palm oil. Coconut oil. I rest my case.
3969 2018-06-01 22:40:55 #askethanandgrayson brush you’re teeth with oil or get a haircut?
3970 2018-06-01 22:40:46 Even though I was concerning with just budgetary framework, and how far we still have to go.,with the much taunted oil economy and human capacity.

Big data economic growth puts California just a step ahead of England for so many reasons you and I know.

But do we have much to..
3971 2018-06-01 22:40:45 I’m breaking out and it might be that bio oil so it’s a dub for that.
3972 2018-06-01 22:40:45 deep conditioning is the key. You should also pre-poo your hair (apply hot oil and let sit for a day or apply some moisturizing masks)
You can also co wash your hair (only use conditionner instead of shampoo)
3973 2018-06-01 22:40:42 YPF se quedó con la operación de Oil, la empresa quebrada de Cristobal López
3974 2018-06-01 22:40:42 To paraphrase a friend what a week I’ve had I’ve burnt my chest and neck with boiling hot oil and now I’ve a glass of whiskey  watching killing eve #LifeIsStrange
3975 2018-06-01 22:40:20 Pope to meet with oil executives to discuss climate change.  

The Pope should be focusing on Souls not Oil.

3978 2018-06-01 22:40:03 London Hyrdocarbons . London produces more oil than the NS apparently 
3979 2018-06-01 22:40:02 Jan24 Frederick Wrona expensed $7.00 on Other Costs - Oil Sands Lab Meeting #ableg
3980 2018-06-01 22:39:56 You're oil claim is not true. We reached max oil
storage before Trump was elected. How do you know? 1. The price has been depressed for some time. 2. Active Oil rig count has never recovered. Storage is maxed out. Trump oil deregulation  was more symbolic, and Koch bros wanted it
3981 2018-06-01 22:39:51 What is baby oil made from?  @EthanDolan @GraysonDolan #AskEthanAndGrayson
3982 2018-06-01 22:39:45 Gottcha. I was actually at that game against Edmonton. I’m from Winnipeg but was in New York when Oil were in town. Was WWE night and than met Henrique and Butcher after and got there autographs.

3984 2018-06-01 22:39:24 Actually, this makes sense. The oil industry has spent the last ten years or more gradually diversifying and working on a staged migration into sustainable energy, foreseeing public and investor sentiment. If they're "forced" backwards, they lose billions too.
3985 2018-06-01 22:39:21 I done did all that  even that nasty castor oil
3986 2018-06-01 22:39:12 If corn oil is made of corn and you is vegetable oil is made of,is you know what roasted baby turtle?   #askethanandgrayson

#NostalgicSummerScents
3991 2018-06-01 22:38:46 I’m just tryna get an oil change
3992 2018-06-01 22:38:25 Even if you did decide to smoke over using oil, who cares? Better for you than being drunk, plus I don’t understand why conservative leadership hates government regulation yet it regulates the most idiotic of things.
3993 2018-06-01 22:38:24 If vegetable oil is made from vegetables and olive oil is made from olives what is baby oil made from? #AskEthanandGrayson LOVE YOU BABIESSSS
3994 2018-06-01 22:38:08 Rub yourselves with oil like you did to your ideas

3997 2018-06-01 22:38:00 @jiffylube your location on Johnnie Dodds in mt pleasant SC refused to give me an oil change at 6:35pm. I pulled up and only 1 car was there. He said we’re closing. I said what time u close? He said ‘now.’ I said what time? He said 7. I told him we had 25 mins and he refused.
3998 2018-06-01 22:37:55 The kind of Oil money involved definitely commanded a significantly high risk vote.

4003 2018-06-01 22:37:35 Those are all democrat talking points. And I’m the one being closed minded? Please. China is communist dictatorship who is no ally of the US and the Russian economy has been degrading with the increase of American oil production.
4004 2018-06-01 22:37:34 Can someone show me a picture of a coconut oil,please
4005 2018-06-01 22:37:26 So today I kind of adulted. I made a list of things for my mom to get at the store but I ended up driving the other car there and I got an oil change. So my mom went to work and gave me money to buy the oil and shop for the items (she said no yogurt and no makeup) while I waited.

4008 2018-06-01 22:36:41 My truck needs an oil change but I have absolutely no idea where the oil filter housing is

4012 2018-06-01 22:36:27 « Hands off the Amazon Reef » « Break free from oil » et une ou deux petites en français, espagnol. Donc, oui, c'est étrange pour une manifestation à Paris... ;)
4013 2018-06-01 22:36:09 Wisely and Trump , it's like trying to mix oil and water !
4014 2018-06-01 22:36:07 Son. You are so right. Would help us old  people with chronic pain too. The oil extract doesn’t get you high but has proven medical benefits
4015 2018-06-01 22:36:05 Most valuable asset is Data these days! Not oil, the 60's we're enclosed knowledge not easily pervasive yet Social Media is improving livelihood daily. Bad intentions are everywhere yet they keep making the Good Stronger, Better.
4016 2018-06-01 22:35:56 Americans drive about 15k miles/yr on average and people generally do oil changes every 5-7k miles. Synthetic is popular here and most people could probably get by with 1 change/yr. So why do they do it more often? Good marketing.
4017 2018-06-01 22:35:49 YPF se quedó con Oil Combustibles..., YPF es de todos, Cristóbal nos robó a todos, cierra.
4018 2018-06-01 22:35:36 My boss had an oil pen sitting on his desk and y’all know my ass stole it and passed it around the building because that’s just me. Keeping the staff uplifted and motivated. 
4019 2018-06-01 22:35:34 Just to make you reconsider your choices even more
"It takes 162g of oil and seven litres of water (including power plant cooling water) just to manufacture a one-litre bottle, creating over 100g of greenhouse gas emissions (10 balloons full of CO2) per empty bottle"
4020 2018-06-01 22:35:34 roadwork that consists of fresh oil and chips is the bane of my fucking existence
4021 2018-06-01 22:35:24 If you hate oil, fine. I get it.  Understand though that for us in AB it means income. Think of BC logging, wine and fisheries being banned.  If you hate nuclear as well, you’re not a realist unless you wish to live like a pioneer. Most do not.
4022 2018-06-01 22:35:23 You got me, I need to refill up on my oil to continue my duties. Have a great rest of your day ! ^JP
4023 2018-06-01 22:35:03 #freemelania You all need to calm down and let Melania rest! When you have a @realDonaldTrump -ectomy it requires a very VERY large incision! Send your good thoughts and lots of Vitamin E oil!
4024 2018-06-01 22:35:01 Bu, oil and eggs are already ingredients. That's double jeopardy, lol.
4025 2018-06-01 22:34:48 Pres. Buhari to Nigerian youths: “You are undoubtedly Nigeria’s most important resource – not oil, not agriculture, not solid minerals – but you and all of us. Your energy, intelligence and talent are what will drive and develop Nigeria, long after we are all gone.”

4028 2018-06-01 22:34:44 Well...upon reading the poll I freaked out, my body said "Noooooo", but then I realised what goes into mayo: eggs, oil, a tad of vinegar. Not such a freak idea after all. Still....I don't think I will be using this technique in the future

4030 2018-06-01 22:34:33 Oil boom you mean? Don’t be deceived by propaganda get your facts right
Pls give me oil price rate from 2010-2015?
And how much are we buying fuel in those years compared to the amount now considering that the FG is paying more on subsidy than during GEJ regime
4031 2018-06-01 22:34:24 The best way to hit back would be to require all trades in the EU are denominated in EUR, or local currencies, instead of USD. End the US Dollar as the world's reserve currency. No longer quote oil, gas, etc in USD, translate all into EUR.
4032 2018-06-01 22:34:19 Do I want to do an oil change and wash the Speed tonight and go to ISS tomorrow?

Come on!!!! If this happened a week ago only

4040 2018-06-01 22:32:55 No debate. Simplistic rhetoric. Better recycle all your oil based clothing, kayaks, shoes, car parts. Don’t buy gas, forget your bicycle parts. Solar oven to cook your meals in 3 hours, mid summer. Say no forevermore to a warm vacation.
4041 2018-06-01 22:32:53 Lo de Oil es más choto porque los dueños están en cana, de manera bastaante dudosa.

4044 2018-06-01 22:32:41 The future wars will not be on oil, gold but Water.

Let’s just not do that anymore.

4050 2018-06-01 22:31:49 Weird hippie here... Tumeric in a baking soda paste+a splash of oil. Let it sit til dry, rinse with vinegar (wheee) repeat once a week. keeps your labs nice and light too.+keeps my pores from flaring up. +pubes thinner. Takes longer than bleach, I assume.

4057 2018-06-01 22:31:16 I know when I begin using oil paints I’m going to turn all the way the fuck up
4058 2018-06-01 22:31:13 I use avocado oil
4059 2018-06-01 22:30:51 Well if you had that attitude towards incompetent and corrupt rulers Pakistan would have been in better position and me not here wasting time on that. You trying to potray that you are champion to comment and more loyal while sitting in oil rich Qatri yards... Hilarious
4060 2018-06-01 22:30:37 Coconut oil right after a shower. I actually break a piece off cuz I leave it in the fridge. Then just feel the cold pieces melt in your scalp as you spread it. Sometimes I mix it with the help grease.
4061 2018-06-01 22:30:35 My nigga asked me if I needed money, no but I would rather you pay for my oil change versus me. 
4062 2018-06-01 22:30:16 85% of America's global economy is powered by oil & gas & coal. Our #RFID tags are made to handle the harsh conditions of these fields.
4063 2018-06-01 22:30:16 Hope his knees holdup better!
4064 2018-06-01 22:30:05 Agreed! Also, the numbers speak for themselves: 94% of Black women voted for Clinton. A remarkably unified voting bloc  that understood how important it was to defeat Trump. Black women remained impervious to snake oil, fear bait & fake news and deserve to lead moving forward.
4065 2018-06-01 22:30:03 I would love to rub loads of oil all over your amazing body Hun xx

4067 2018-06-01 22:29:39 Seguramente el frustrado presidente de AFA @cuervotinelli va a tener a algún directivo de YPF en la pista, ya que tomaron el control de OIL COMBUSTIBLES de su ¿ex? socio don Cristóbal López.

4073 2018-06-01 22:27:45 To help the stress,  I made a nice steaming bowl of combination Lavender oil and Patchouli oil

Essential oils are not so expensive here and they had a nice variety at the pharmacy.  It was still a little money, but I think it was worth it
4074 2018-06-01 22:27:45 Gotta be careful with my oil leak so I aint comin to summer reeze 

Hurt someone during SKOURGE for me
4075 2018-06-01 22:27:42 Coal was replaced by technological evolution, i.e. oil, gas, energy efficiency. Problem was we didn't replace those jobs. Steel is being replaced by globalist offshoring. Different problem. Steel doesn't need to go. Bankers/public sector workers will be poorer if we keep it.
4076 2018-06-01 22:27:40 Im listening to my Elvis' Golden Hits record while my air diffuser is chock full of an essential oil called Cheer Up Buttercup so ya I'm enjoying my summer thank u for asking

4078 2018-06-01 22:27:26 Hey Canada let’s sell our oil and softwood lumber to China and drain our over production of hydro into the   Ground. Tell dick head Quebec has sold hydro to America at a discount for years and Ontario has purchased it back for money. And we actually paid Michigan to take surplus.

4082 2018-06-01 22:26:26 How many gallons of potable water are being hauled off to frac new wells? Any figures on this? The U.S. has all the oil and gas it needs right now. Our water is being used up to produce more oil/gas that is exported. How stupid are we?
4083 2018-06-01 22:26:20 Not sure. JP + 10 ? I’d probably offer Nuge straight up. And you know what I think of RNH and JP. I think Svechnikov can score 40G for sure maybe 50G.
4084 2018-06-01 22:26:19 The country is appeasing their oil suppliers.

4086 2018-06-01 22:26:16 One thing that very much bothers me about Erdogan is that he is the only single leader to vociferously condemn Israel (even while delivering them oil the next day). Everyone should condemn both Israel & him. #pot&kettlebothblack
4087 2018-06-01 22:26:16 Who better to buy oil from? Western stable democracy with cap and trade on carbon, or a mid-east sheikhdom that surpresses women and religious minorities and supported 9/11 terrorists? #BuyCanadian #tytlive
4088 2018-06-01 22:26:13 Hey.  Go for yogurt,  and coconut oil or olive oil.  Best cleansers moisturizers ever.
4089 2018-06-01 22:25:57 The man was a slimy snake oil salesman. Total misuse of power. He's not a family man and isn't the man for Missouri. He actually sounds like he needs help.
4090 2018-06-01 22:25:47 This is why they mix it with heavy oil. Just 20% of Permian production can meet WTI specification, 80%  must be mixed with heavy oil to get the WTI grade. This is exactly why the WTI price is in freefall.

A multi-million $ #racecar pulled apart for inspection,reassembled, clocking laps minutes later.
I can't even change my oil without winding up with extra #bits when I'm done.

4102 2018-06-01 22:24:21 Go away, this is my home. This is my castle. I'LL defend myself with cannons and boiling oil.
4103 2018-06-01 22:23:51 The world will use oil with or without this pipeline. It just won’t be Albertan oil, and therefore won’t be nearly as ecologically sourced. 

You’d rather have Russia or Saudi Arabia produce all our oil? 

You demand our services, then decry the process of giving them to you.
4104 2018-06-01 22:23:36 Why did i decide not to eat anything before getting this oil change 
4105 2018-06-01 22:23:33 I need to go to The store to buy oil and conditioner and i don’t want to drive bc my car is dirty but everyone refuses to do my chores for me

4110 2018-06-01 22:23:16 No, it does not come from oil, try again.

Even if it did the amount of climate change from this low amount of nitrogen compared to that of the methane produced by Anag would be negligible. Keep grasping :)
4111 2018-06-01 22:23:05 Agree on the need for stronger communities. In that light, have you considered changing your position on [tar sands/oil sands/bituminous sands]? Because if we don't stop runaway climate change there won't be communities worth the name.
4112 2018-06-01 22:22:44 Test your relationship with your significant other.  Go golfing together or change the oil and fix a flat on a car together

4116 2018-06-01 22:22:15 They need to put in the labels of suntan oil that it's not recommended for red heads
4117 2018-06-01 22:22:13 Wait, they just nationalized their oil supply and we've just raised tensions? Has anyone told President Orange that it's the great WHITE north? Or is he branching out? Shit, we're going to have to winterize everything... #tytlive
4118 2018-06-01 22:22:07 He lied about electoral reform, he lied about clean drinking water on the reserves, he lied about thorough environmental assessments before oil and gas projects, he has violated ethics rules numerous times. And he cheered both times Trump bombed Syria.
4119 2018-06-01 22:22:05 وأنا يا صديقتي أخبرتُك أنني أخاف الفقدان كثيراً أخاف أن أستيقظ يوماً ولا أجدك ، أخبرتك كل الأشياء التي قد تخيفني ويؤسفني أنك فعلتها وغبتُ!
4120 2018-06-01 22:21:27 See your making stories up again  You should do a little research before print like phone oil companies up that couldn't ship oil each month because the pipeline capacity was over booked A phone call to a few of the big producers would have shown you different to what you wrote
4121 2018-06-01 22:21:21 It's #NationalDonutDay! Do you have a sweet tooth like we do? Since our signature oil change only takes 10 minutes, that gives you some extra time to go grab a treat afterward!

4125 2018-06-01 22:21:16 You evidence that Canada has treated us poorly? While timber and oil piplines are issues, out here in the West we find Canada to be a very cooperative neighbor. Sorry NYC and Washington DC are treated poorly. Quit your blustering which only hurts us.
4126 2018-06-01 22:20:57 Some of my old vehicles would be happy that's ALL the oil it leaked or burned...

4150 2018-06-01 22:18:17 So you’d rather Russia or Venezuela export oil? Both of which being far less ecologically considerate? Alberta, which is part of Canada if you didn’t notice, spends billions annually protecting the environment.

You’d rather support international dictators than Albertan families.
4151 2018-06-01 22:18:07 Canada and it’s oil says HELLO China!
4152 2018-06-01 22:17:55 Agree that it sounds gross, but mayo is just eggs & oil. Most baked goods have eggs & oil in them.

4154 2018-06-01 22:17:45 Lol i just debunked this false narrative in your other post.. Venezuelans suffering because their economy is heavily dependent on oil prices and their govt suffers from massive corruption..
4155 2018-06-01 22:17:44 Summer of '73 it was .259 . I could fill up my VW for less than the price of a gallon today. That winter was the 1st Arab oil embargo, officially to punish the west for supporting Israel.

4160 2018-06-01 22:17:35 Why is then Midland WTI still USD 10 cheaper in Houston. If oil is already in Houston, transport is not an issue anymore, only quality can be.
4161 2018-06-01 22:17:31 The pipeline purchase was a response to possible US action like this, ilike it or not we depend on selling our oil, if we can't sell to the US we need to be able to send it to BC oil terminals, China will be happy to buy our oil #tytlive
4162 2018-06-01 22:17:26 also you have to drink the oil and if youre getting breakfast youre gonna have a full tummy already

4166 2018-06-01 22:16:55 This Jaguar don't need oil change like mine
4167 2018-06-01 22:16:53 Wait a minute: you were suggesting climate change as supporting death yes? I see massive energy use. The nitrogen used to grow plants indoors comes from oil. This is not zero death. How much of your food comes from here?
4168 2018-06-01 22:16:47 Car was super low on oil. Thirsty girl!
4169 2018-06-01 22:16:43 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for internalized misogyny, and put some benzene essential oil in my diffuser.
4170 2018-06-01 22:16:31 Saudi Arabia would hardly support electric power! If oil use can be reduced, they'll lose their power, which is why they're investing so heavily in current tech giants.
4171 2018-06-01 22:16:21 Please dont elevate @JustinTrudeau to anything more  than he is; a corperstist schill. He just paid 4.5 billion dollars to a Texas oil company for a 65 year old pipe line. He continues to betray first nations canadians, and break promises continually.
4172 2018-06-01 22:16:18 1)Change the oil in your car regularly, it has to be done if you want your car to last more than a year. 2) Don’t tell@me all oil brands and filters are the same thing.
4173 2018-06-01 22:16:07 Just apply some oil to the seized joint and it'll break the rust up... 
4174 2018-06-01 22:16:01 Putin told him to. Putin wants wedge between US-EU; also wants breakup of EU. This gives him more influence over individual countries dependent on his oil & gas tit! Making them dependent on RU energy, therefore compliant on RU policies.  There’s more....

4178 2018-06-01 22:15:45 Hey @JustinTrudeau why not put tariffs on electricity that we sell to the States or Oil, or Natural Gas, the stuff that they need. The stuff you put tariffs on will cost me, the average consumer.  Thanks, Dickhead.
4179 2018-06-01 22:15:36 There were several reports of rising material costs, notably for steel, aluminum, oil, oil derivatives, lumber, and cement. A few Districts noted that these reports of rising materials costs were becoming more common across contacts.

4180 2018-06-01 22:15:33 Quite. Inflation of food prices was a major factor in the economic downturn of the 1970s, often blamed on the (non-existent) oil embargo by Arab states.
4181 2018-06-01 22:15:25 Please you know what happens next. Tommy is elevated to a mouthpiece and the rates keep going up and the oil prices keep going up and working poor rents keep going up and me and @Gavin_McInnes and @ezralevant collect the dividends. Dupers and Dupees thats all its about.

4216 2018-06-01 22:11:22 It's from Fallout 2. The Enclave sent the all-clear signal to Vault 13 to convince them to open. They opened fire to scare the dwellers into submission before kidnapping the rest as test subjects and taken to the Enclave Oil Rig.

4230 2018-06-01 22:09:13 Well we'll just have to disagree on that one, particularly on the oil nonsense.
4231 2018-06-01 22:08:57 There are many oil burning units in Americas power generation fleet. It's not that they have grown a conscience, it's that they want to protect profit.

4237 2018-06-01 22:08:05 THE # 1 thing folks ingest that INFLAMES THE BODY IS

OIL OIL OIL..YOU DO NOT EAT OIL !!!

OIL is not a soluble and does not mix with water...it clogs everything in your body and causes inflammation

SNAKE, FISH, KRILL, HEMP, OLIVE, SOY, CORN, CANOLA, MOTOR ..ect.

IS BAD FOR YOU

4240 2018-06-01 22:07:56 It would be a very wise investment to take the necessary steps to insure clean oil. Glanon International manufactures a portable filtration unit called a Filter-Cart that is a wise investment. The Filter-Cart will remove that contamination, water and particulates.

4245 2018-06-01 22:07:31 I get mine from a friend's trees in western MA. If it were graded, it would be Grade B motor oil, aka the best. Vermont maple syrup is second best, at best...

4253 2018-06-01 22:05:57 I spent 30 minutes stood with baby oil on to try and soak off my tan and then an hour in the shower trying to get it off just to have fresh skin to tan in the morning. Why am I not naturally blessed

4260 2018-06-01 22:05:12 About 10%.  US also exports oil to Canada.  A bit more complex than you portray.  Canada doesn't want to play hardball with the US.

4263 2018-06-01 22:04:28 As machines become more sophisticated and powerful, their need for clean oil becomes more and more critical. It is generally agreed by those who design and manufacture them that about 75% of all hydraulic system failures are caused by various kinds of contamination. I

Not only it would be heavily defended, it would also took a lot of Germany's oil reserve which is running dried by that time.

4285 2018-06-01 22:01:13 Reliability is incredibly good where it matters most on Teslas simply because its electric, and has a fraction of the moving parts that combustion engines have. No oil changes, no oil, no timing belts, no spark plugs, no headers. The only thing moving are the wheels.

- microwave brussel sprouts for 3 mins
- toss in a bowl with olive oil
- toss in spice mix (paprika, dry mustard, garlic powder)
- roast on a wood skewer on the barbecue 6 mins/flip/6 mins (or in the oven in a  pinch)

4328 2018-06-01 21:53:20 Bacopa, Lion's mane, Syrian Rue, Nigella sativa oil, Cannabis indica/sativa, Gotu kola, Catuaba bark all with the similar purpose. They all work in unison for a combined effect when consumed daily.

4355 2018-06-01 21:49:55 omg yes! like im sorry i didnt know i had to research oil changes beforehand so i can answer all their questions!
4356 2018-06-01 21:49:53 Our country, in this case Canada, seems to hate oil & gas at the federal level.

As far as water goes, we have _a lot of it_ so that should be a no-brainer.

As far as the economy goes, the numbers explain themselves.

Keynesian or ?
4357 2018-06-01 21:49:52 Lmao I think this tweet is meant to be read in-between the lines
4358 2018-06-01 21:49:31 I seriously doubt that claim. More pressing issues: Constitutional crisis, tariffs threatening thousands of jobs and consumer prices, skyrocketing oil prices caused by GOP policies, losing or being unable to afford healthcare (again threatened by GOP policies). Own your errors.
4359 2018-06-01 21:49:27 See this is why you do those checklists when you get an oil change.  It's a domino effect that leads right to all of your hidden bodies.  I have no sympathy for this fellow.  He didn't do his due diligence, and also he is evil and all that.

4364 2018-06-01 21:49:08 Trump doesnt control gas prices. You are all so smart, you would think you'd know that. Supply and demand. When OPEC cuts production, oil prices rise.
4365 2018-06-01 21:49:06 At some points it's amazing how much sound editing starts to feel like some kind of hard labor on an oil rig rather than artistic and white-color.
4366 2018-06-01 21:49:02 @bpnutrition 

I do not need you to be the latest trend,
I do not need you to be high end! 
I just need you to be mold free, robust with oil is what pleases me!

4368 2018-06-01 21:48:59 You're hypocrisy is mind numbing. Tell us about your non-carbon footprint and how you are not responsible for the oil companies need to build more. Maybe you live in one of those gated communities pushing the wildlife back while screaming save the whales. So obvious, yet so dumb.
4369 2018-06-01 21:48:55 Example, México is a country that produces oil, and have to import gasoline from the USA to the consume in the mexican territory
4370 2018-06-01 21:48:27 The government gives 3.3 billion dollars in subsidies to oil and gas producers every year. Not enough?

4380 2018-06-01 21:47:26 "Climate megacrimes..."? Where do you come up with this alarmist crap.

"Peace Region will never be the same..."? Ever walked over reclaimed oil/gas well sites? Trust me when I say I can show you sites that you would never know were once developed.

Relax. We got this.

4383 2018-06-01 21:47:00 Scottish GDP lags behind the UK and declining oil revenues have raised questions over the fiscal sustainability for an independent Scotland – especially if it intends to retain the pound,” he added.
4384 2018-06-01 21:46:50 It's their choice. Just as it was the choice of proponents to bully the Feds into signing over control of a pipeline that will pollute and spoil BC waters. The oil spill is a matter of time, the choice of protesters is a matter of conscience.

4390 2018-06-01 21:46:09 @thefive Greg, 1st rub olive oil on wax that's in your sink&scrub w/green dish scrub pad. Then use Dawn soap and hot water in separate bucket,&scrub the olive oil&wax with the dawn soap mixture.

The olive oil will start2break down the wax&the dawn soap will wash them both away.

4398 2018-06-01 21:45:43 They will see the sky will look like the black filth of oil, the earth beneath them will crack piece by piece, the oceans will be on fire that day and they will explode in their places. Allahu Akbar, picture this in your mind.
4399 2018-06-01 21:45:32 "Pope convenes oil execs to talk climate change." – The only climate changes the Pope should be concerned with are those detailed in chapters 8 and 9 of Revelation.

4401 2018-06-01 21:45:19 @EPAScottPruitt on that note CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. All your oil/gas/chemical lobbying asswipe money will never change that its amazing that ur capable of sleep but just shows the evil deep seeded root of greed in this mans soul where money is more important to him than life

4404 2018-06-01 21:44:40 @TheFive boiling water melts the wax Greg! DUH!  also Murphy’s oil soap helps get it off of carpet.
4405 2018-06-01 21:44:39 Scotland’s revenues from North Sea oil have collapsed by 97 per cent in the past year as oil prices have plummeted, reigniting a fierce debate over whether an independent Scotland could finance itself.
4406 2018-06-01 21:44:32 Make sure to take pictures, thanks to our minister @cathmckenna all of that will be an oil wasteland. Plus we will be paying for the privilege.
4407 2018-06-01 21:44:16 Generator wanted the oil from the ejadindin, òróró eja díndín
4408 2018-06-01 21:44:13 Taxes collected from oil production fell from £1.8bn in 2015 to just £60m in 2016. The gap between tax revenues and what Scotland spends is now 9.5 per cent, or £14.8bn, compared to a 4 per cent deficit for the UK as a whole.
4409 2018-06-01 21:44:12 I love your dark chocolate digestives but, whilst shopping, my daughter pointed out that they contain non-sustainable palm oil, so if I buy them I'd be destroying the #environment and killing orangutans.
So I'm not allowed them anymore!
Please find a sustainable source!

4411 2018-06-01 21:44:02 I'm glad you are continuing your crusade against corrupt elected officials...oh wait.  Why don't you start with @EPAScottPruitt? You know, the guy who has turned the EPA into every big oil polluting lobbyist dream? #spareme #fauxoutrage
4412 2018-06-01 21:44:01 Use oil.
4413 2018-06-01 21:43:51 I'll raise you a tiger balm and say 
Wong To Yick Wood Lock Oil. It's amazing stuff but for your own sanity, thoroughly wash your hands before touching eyes or junk...
4414 2018-06-01 21:43:49 Saddam killed by USA over oil reasons.
Gaddafi, the same.
Nasser, God knows.
Ali Abdullah Saleh was killed by Houthis after taking Saudi's side.
You really look like a fool 
4415 2018-06-01 21:43:44 so many things need to be taken into account when eating ethically. being vegan and simply not eating anything derived from animals doesn’t make you amazing when you’re eating avocados, palm oil, fruit/veg flown from abroad etc
4416 2018-06-01 21:43:41 From what I understand they all work for the republican oil company in some capacity. Get it
4417 2018-06-01 21:43:39 Lavender essential oil spray?
4418 2018-06-01 21:43:29 I have tremendous amounts of respect for any man willing to draw a line in the sand regarding the overuse of this passé hand gesture. It was cool when wrestlers did it, not so much when the guy changing your oil at Jiffy Lube does it!
4419 2018-06-01 21:43:23 And, given the current trade instability with the US, Canada must find solutions for diversifying our oil markets.  Pipelines east and west address that issue.  Additionally, using pipelines for oil frees up rail cars for transporting western grain to ports, east and west.
4420 2018-06-01 21:43:22 Please note: a laughing brown-eyed INTP oil heiress, slowly removing a periwinkle pair of quick-witted knee-high riding boots, quietly brushes the awesome mane of a thoughtfully thrilling blue-eyed cremello Canadian Pacer horse.
4421 2018-06-01 21:43:16 How could this help us taxpayers who don't even live in the Western Provinces ?  We can sell oil overseas great what is the returns for Canadians for use of this pipeline ?  If we the taxpayers own it should be profitable as oil/gas companies use ?  How much is our shares worth?

4427 2018-06-01 21:43:00 Also that oil is delicious.  Good in soy sauce for dipping gyoza.
4428 2018-06-01 21:42:28 Modi ji made a blunder by not punishing and finishing his enemies, or the enemy of state. He will pay for this mistake (that's what we have learnt from history)
4429 2018-06-01 21:41:55 @realDonaldTrump oil companies are crooks and shouldn’t have the ability to shoot gas prices up in the summer, make a change, make America great
4430 2018-06-01 21:41:38 Neolib Canada, which is busy developing the environmentally most destructive oil in the world, knows how to protect its own interests (yes, I know Trudeau sucks up to Israel at every opportunity, so you're down with him).  If Trump takes NK off the table, what's wrong with that?
4431 2018-06-01 21:41:38 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
4432 2018-06-01 21:41:33 CA gun laws aren't about #gunsafety or crime reduction. They're about sucking you into a game of *pin a felony on a jackass' so they can make you a prohibited person AND take your guns. Better to have a boating accident

4434 2018-06-01 21:41:11 alternatively make basil pesto! No tomato. Basil, pine nuts, parmesan cheese, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, mix together. Red pesto is great too, replace the basil with roasted red peppers and add chili for a kick!
4435 2018-06-01 21:40:53 As if it takes a real genius to figure out the oligarchs in the American south have the same business objectives regarding oil as the oligarchs in Russia.  This stuff is REAL difficult to figure out, right?  Nobody can see it at all, right?
4436 2018-06-01 21:40:34 Why say "Oil industry" when you mean "natural gas industry"?
4437 2018-06-01 21:40:32 The standout here is that mobile operators and oil aren’t investing in R+D... you’d think they’d invest in research to diversify?

4442 2018-06-01 21:40:21 We shall see, unemployment down again and stocks rising.  Oil is back to a respectable price per barrel. It pains me that some can't see the forest for the trees.
4443 2018-06-01 21:40:18 Today is a good day you feel me. Shit finna go get my oil change, hit the gym, clean my apartment, cook dinner, hell may hit a movie by myself shit... we finna embrace this good feeling today.

4503 2018-06-01 21:31:44 Also interesting that you observe that some “dictator regimes desire it now.”  So the current president of our country believes we should invade and take their oil.  Like that, you mean?  Have you been outside the U.S.?  Since the end of WWII *we* are as imperialistic as anyone?
4504 2018-06-01 21:31:33 How come when you get your oil changed they treat you like you’re stupid 
4505 2018-06-01 21:31:24 Can I look for recommendations on an oil plug on fb? 
Asking for a friend...
4506 2018-06-01 21:31:22 TRAFFIC UPDATE AT 22:18: The roads on the TT course remain closed between Ballig Bridge and Douglas Road Corner, Kirk Michael to deal with oil spillage.

The rest of the TT course is now open, including the Mountain Section that is one way. #iomtt
4507 2018-06-01 21:31:20 iya, kleveru face oil sedangkan pacific herb kan serum jd ya beda step
4508 2018-06-01 21:31:17 And if @BillClinton can pardon Marc Rich after receiving $$$$ from Rich’s ex wife, @realDonaldTrump can pardon anyone he wants. FYI, Mr. Rich was indicted for trading oil with Iran and $$$$ tax evasion. He was a fugitive from justice for many years. An abomination of a decision.
4509 2018-06-01 21:31:17 That's because they're Quebec jobs. Oil field, shutting them down. Those jobs don't matter to Trudeau.
4510 2018-06-01 21:31:15 CBD oil in mascara? Hopefully I’d get high... volume for my lashes. 

Lol, get it?
4511 2018-06-01 21:31:12 Aku sih pakai Nacific dulu baru Kleveru. Alasannya sih gatau wkwkk tapi kalo di 10 steps Korean Skincare sih abis serum itu face oil. Nah, Nacific itu kan serum, Kleveru itu face oil. Jadi kalo dibarengin makenya ya gapapa. Tinggal sesuaikan sama masalah kulitmu.
4512 2018-06-01 21:30:31 Castor oil can fix that js

4514 2018-06-01 21:30:18 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
4515 2018-06-01 21:30:05  oxi! But they need to clean their pans better and use fresh oil...#justssaying. Not trying to start a chippy war 
4516 2018-06-01 21:29:44 I used sunflower oil in a Xantia 1.9 TD. Didn't tell the wife that car had a full tank of low cholesterol cooking oil. Told me car started to smell like a chip shop but it went really well...until crank timing belt pulley spun on the crankshaft when the keyway failed.
4517 2018-06-01 21:29:43 But oil tanker & commercial fishing kills the waters. 

LOL.

Government at every level in this State is filled with grifters.
4518 2018-06-01 21:29:39 Opinion time.  You buy a brand new car that is less than a year old.  You take it in at 3 months & the dealership puts 3 deep scratches into it.  They promise to fix it at the next oil change & now they don't want to fix it now there is another scratch that paint has been removed
4519 2018-06-01 21:29:31 And also canola and soybean oil!
4520 2018-06-01 21:29:26 Probably watched too many movies or lots of stupid WCW angles from the Vince Russo era. Also my phone tried to auto correct Vince into concept, looks like the spilt cod liver oil is still effect me haha
4521 2018-06-01 21:29:17 Hey Phil, tell your friend that this April  2,600 gallons of oil spilled into the river from a foreign-flagged ship called Iver Exporter, currently moored at the Shell Norco Manufacturing Complex. EPA do your job.
4522 2018-06-01 21:29:15 Girl, 1. You're hella cute idk what you're talking about and 2. Come over and we'll do some shit. I got some coconut oil specifically for hair, we could make some masks or deep condition. Let's gooooo
4523 2018-06-01 21:29:08 على حساب مين توزع هالتذاكر!؟
4524 2018-06-01 21:28:59 I wish someone would deliver palm oil to my door step.
4525 2018-06-01 21:28:44 This bothers me so much. “OIL IS 100% CALORIES FROM FAT” ...and the problem is? It’s obviously not a weight loss food but that doesn’t negate its health benefits. Although I’m weary about consuming coconut oil bc saturated fat, canola oil is a good source of omega-3s 
4526 2018-06-01 21:28:32 OMG my back is killin me! (bent over to untangle the hose) 
Trying cbd oil for the first time! COME ON CBD!
4527 2018-06-01 21:28:31 Lol wax oil would have been more use
4528 2018-06-01 21:28:28 I'll admit this freely... Coconut oil tastes gross.
4529 2018-06-01 21:28:22 You’re right to be skeptical brother. These “flat earthers” aka cognitive elite from academia would have us believe that a medicine is safer than such well- researched supplements as vit D, fish oil, probiotics , & curcumin to name a few.
4530 2018-06-01 21:28:19 Coconut oil for me. Are you drinking Bubly brand seltzer?
4531 2018-06-01 21:28:15 41k 

I’ll go to NTA complex inside gate market in Ibadan ...I’ll cut different types of materials , atiku and guinea then take it to aboki inside sabo . 

Fabrics and sewing at least 30k . Buy perfume oil 5k . 

Total 35k . Put 6k for wallet, big boy de .
4532 2018-06-01 21:27:59 @India_Yamaha very disappointed with the service..service team charged 7k for changing fork oil cap. Removal of  fork bend..but now telling to change some bearing which again costs 1k..it's not even month I hve serviced the vehicle..is this the kind of service you are providing?
4533 2018-06-01 21:27:23 I’m honored! Thank you to all of my fans 
4534 2018-06-01 21:27:13 Let me guess: there’s some underlying reason he wants to do this. Perhaps mining, building private prisons, oil & gas drilling? All of the above?
4535 2018-06-01 21:27:12 @MMAXXXOFFICIAL @JillKassidyy  vs @RileyReyXXX  in a baby oil match the lady who survives gets to has her way with @iluvchristie 
4536 2018-06-01 21:27:08 Essentially Oil Therapy, licensed. Contact Lynn. Can come to me in Clanton or I can come to you in Prattville, Jemison, Thirsby or Alabaster area. 30minute sessions.
4537 2018-06-01 21:26:55 Massive oil and gas fields, not to mention the diamond mines, why not?
Mexico would actually be a VERY wealthy country with all the oil they have there, but since their government is so corrupt, it is still poor.
4538 2018-06-01 21:26:31 Jasmine oil blend took me by surprise this last week and I am LOVING it 
4539 2018-06-01 21:26:25 I really can't complain about this heat. The coconut butter turns into coconut oil on its own now, no microwave necessary.
4540 2018-06-01 21:26:18 No more surprising than a left leaning elitist from Ontario trying to educate the great unwashed populous from Alberta on the dangers of the oil sands.

4543 2018-06-01 21:25:49 @Walmart yo one of your oil change guys crashed my car into the curb and said nothing to me. Like for real tho.
4544 2018-06-01 21:25:46 I try to talk every Uber driver into buying a Tesla.  When they tell me how much has and the monthly oil changes , it makes financial sense
4545 2018-06-01 21:25:44 I saw Trump saying a very long goodbye to the NK spy guy today. At one point I thought Trump was either going to kiss him or check the oil and antifreeze in his SUV.  That hambone just kept waving. Geesh.
4546 2018-06-01 21:25:36 It actually works to give the cake moisture. You can substitute for oil. Mayo is eggs and oil emulsified so in a pinch it could work. Especially good with chocolate cake or as a quick base for a frosting

4548 2018-06-01 21:25:31 It's easy. Don't like guns? Don't buy one. Problem solved. You don't see me trying to get asparagus banned.
4549 2018-06-01 21:25:31 Mine actually do too  I use coconut oil on them
4550 2018-06-01 21:25:14 Not negative at all. Only responding the the calls the JS has made on oil. I did not make those calls, he did. And he has been wrong on the rally from $50 to $72. Fortunately I don't listen to his advise. I do my own research and trade accordingly. Congrats on your winning trade.
4551 2018-06-01 21:25:01 Holder only. I won't experiment out of principle, probably dumb as there's a lot of money to be made off ppl who believe in shit coins. There's only BTC, all else is hype/snake oil/scams/smoke and mirrors

Not sure about tomorrow and Sunday. Something shall be grilled though!
4554 2018-06-01 21:24:55 They also reaped HUGELY from investing in slavery. That didn't make it right. It is 2018. NO government on earth should be investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure. Instead, they need to be investing in renewables and ways to transition away from oil. #Climatechange
4555 2018-06-01 21:24:40 I loved the patronizing comments about me from the Exemis executives....Nice try! But sorry they are not simply selling snake oil! Call it morcellation or XCor-ing they are both oncologically dangerous and defective when it comes to tumors with malignant potential.
4556 2018-06-01 21:24:38 Never buying your products again.  Oil has made our civilization possible.  Fossil fuels will still dominate our energy mix for decades because renewables are a long way from competitive or scalable.
4557 2018-06-01 21:24:30 I appreciate your America first policy,  that said you should check out how much the states owns in this country, GM, Ford, Dodge, US steel, oil fields in Alberta,  not to mention NORAD, it’s ok, our prime minister is an idiot but in 2019 get ready!!

4574 2018-06-01 21:22:47 Punya olive oil nya Wardah yang udah sebulanan lebih dianggurin soalnya dulu beli cuma karena penasaran aja
4575 2018-06-01 21:22:44 Meanwhile bonds, stocks, commodities (oil, gold, etc.), inflation numbers (those hedonic & seasonal adjustments are so handy) are manipulated regularly by CBs (BoJ, SNB & others flat out prop up stocks) but there’s no pearl clutching  about these much larger scandals.  Spare us.
4576 2018-06-01 21:22:41 We can't become energy independent if our oil is sold on the global market, which it is.

4578 2018-06-01 21:22:19 LOL Canada doesn't need us. You do realize we buy majority of our oil from them right?

4607 2018-06-01 21:18:33 The idea that batteries need replacing is a myth , likely put about by oil companies and Manufacturers against EVs. Many low end Leaf taxis about with excess of 250,000 miles. NEVER ever heard of a Leaf or ZOE or any EV contact I know needing batteries being replaced.

4633 2018-06-01 21:15:16 All crap, all snake oil sellers wanting your money! There is no GSM, one likely by 2050 will cool the globe 0.13–0.3°C. The Little Ice Age was only 0.5°C cooler than early 1900s and we have warmed 1°C since then! 0.3°C cooling would still mean 1.2-0.3=0.9°C WARMING! No ice age!
4634 2018-06-01 21:15:10 Talking about persistence with @thedoophus and he said 
“The squeaky wheel gets the oil.”

Profound.
4635 2018-06-01 21:14:58 Coconut oil is the best!!  unrefined extra virgin coconut oil
4636 2018-06-01 21:14:53 Have you ever tried CBD oil for that?
4637 2018-06-01 21:14:37 @Franktmcveety I wonder why there has not been an uproar over the crude oil tanker run aground at Morrisburg, On? Why is crude oil being moved by waterways (St.Lawrence) and not by pipelines? Not Alberta OIL!!
4638 2018-06-01 21:14:35 Donuts are cut and rising for the 2nd time. Glaze is made. Oil's heating up.
4639 2018-06-01 21:14:29 Would you like him to force oil pipelines through your community?
4640 2018-06-01 21:14:15 Your right we should just keep buying oil from all those country's that want to kill us and rape our women. #arrogantelite

4644 2018-06-01 21:13:56 Can you imagine driving to get your oil changed, you 35 miles away from the dealership and your air just stops working ????

4668 2018-06-01 21:11:38 We should cut off cheap oil. I’d like to see them walking, or waddling, not driving. Fat bastards would notice Canada then.
4669 2018-06-01 21:11:37 Aren't the UK self governing now? Thought it was a democracy , so we've been taught which we try and impose on oil rich countries by invading them under the guise of liberating people and putting a democratic system in place . I must have missed something - oh yh nationalism+oil
4670 2018-06-01 21:11:36 The US has ripped off Canada for decades now why the hell should Canada trade with the US at all. Canada should triple tariffs to the US starting with our oil then our hydro and so on. I am sick and tired of idiot Trump putting down our country.

4681 2018-06-01 21:10:54 Correct climate leaders don’t , oil producing nations do . If you want to be a climate leader maybe it would be better done somewhere that doesn’t have oil . I hear reducing emissions is really easy there .

4691 2018-06-01 21:09:37 you know i was debating on using that this morning but i was nervous that it would dry it out toooo much... but i feel like being dry is better than all this oil
4692 2018-06-01 21:09:36 What’s is breadth oil I ask?? You ask?? I did not know
4693 2018-06-01 21:09:28 My mom just put vegetable oil in the closet like it was sun screen
4694 2018-06-01 21:09:17 Gel , water and oil lol
4695 2018-06-01 21:09:03 Veg oil in a diesel? That was my first TV item back in 2006. Bought the Merc off @FifthGearTV office and ran it for the next 18 months on filtered kebab house cooking fat.
4696 2018-06-01 21:08:47 Busy filling a car boot. I’m on a mystery tour of Leith. Tyres..check...water...check....oil...check...kitchen sink?

I’m about ready to say goodbye to this phone. It has been doing some weird word spelling since it’s second update. I’m convince it’s still got bugs. #size
4697 2018-06-01 21:08:43 You do still grow it but America's consumption is too high that it can't meet demand. Plus your farms were sold to big interest to produce oil. That's not going to change because of a tariff on Canada. Unless you're fine with converting your country to 80% farm land.
4698 2018-06-01 21:08:36 I don't really care what China can afford to lose. What America can't afford to lose is its ability to be self-sustaining. Russia holds oil and gas over many small European nations that can't produce it themselves. We need to be self-sufficient to be competitive.

4708 2018-06-01 21:07:16 It is still far from the workers having say on the production, not to mention that it means nothing on how the environmental impact of oil extraction could be reduced. At least we hope fuel prices will be untied from international market, as Brazil is fully capable of producing.
4709 2018-06-01 21:07:09 Theater popcorn is nasty. That oil they pour on top and call butter is an utter travesty. I actually prefer the '80's old school hot air popper type w/ real melted butter and just a touch of salt. @TomServonaut don't you agree?
4710 2018-06-01 21:06:33 She is one of my all-time faves. I'm listening to the new record in a waiting room during an oil change and trying not to cry? I really should know better than to give a first listen in public.

4715 2018-06-01 21:06:06 I only wish I had as much of a clue as a guy that clearly buys all the snake oil Trump can sell.  
4716 2018-06-01 21:05:58 Trade cannot be increased if transportation can't move goods fast enough, because oil prices are too high
4717 2018-06-01 21:05:56 One theory is that China’s stricter policy of adhering to the United Nations sanctions last year against N Korea has brought Kim Jong Un to the negotiating table.  China had accounted for 83% of N Korea’s exports by 2016. By Nov Chinese customs data showed no oil exports
4718 2018-06-01 21:05:53 @realMAXBMW  my brand new g310gs purchased at max bmw in Troy , ny is burning oil at a feverish rate and is losing power when ridden for over 20 minutes. Not the experience I was hoping for with my first new BMW!

4728 2018-06-01 21:04:59 i haven't did it in awhile but putting an oil mixture usually does the trick. like coconut & olive oil.
4729 2018-06-01 21:04:46 probably once a year or less than that :P It's just easier than dropping oil on the exhaust pipes or getting out the foil
4730 2018-06-01 21:04:38 as long as there's no oil, minerals or  anything else he can lease it for then maybe he'll help.
4731 2018-06-01 21:04:25 Coconut oil pulling worked for me
4732 2018-06-01 21:04:21 Why do oil companies want the opinion of a man who protects pedophiles?

4734 2018-06-01 21:03:53 Oil for Mercedes Benz's & industrial eqpt & Bordeaux's.  Throw in a Airbus's.  Balance any net at a gold price trading WAY higher than it is today (as the EU proposed doing in the 1970s) & it would work just fine.  Unless you were the US government...then you'd have issues
4735 2018-06-01 21:03:17 I need to remember to pack baby oil

4739 2018-06-01 21:03:05 So for 16 years of PdP that you are praising, all they could do was to initiate projects and couldn't complete them? 
Yet you are asking Buhari to Initiate and complete projects in 3 years....

4740 2018-06-01 21:03:01 Get my car back from an oil change.. and they got oil all over my damn seats... got khaki color seats too hope they ready to detail my shit!
4741 2018-06-01 21:02:53 As a Canadian I have to day trump doesnt know what hes talking about we sell America power and oil and buy it back at a loss. If he destroys NAFTA it will help us alot more
4742 2018-06-01 21:02:46 All levels of taxes including hidden and the Cons favourite user fees total 55% in Canada.
We kid ourselves when we think we are anywhere near the 30% of the U.S. Bothom line Albertans have virtually nothing to show for all the oil we sold? gave away?
4743 2018-06-01 21:02:35 So I’ve been putting coconut oil on my eyebrows every night to make my eyebrows grow back thicker and more hairs and it literally fucking works!! I should’ve took a before and after picture

4748 2018-06-01 21:02:12 Yes. Sadly it is our rivers & seas which are the dumping ground for this kind of waste. It's no way to treat them in the 21st Century.
Rubbish not put in bins. Sewage misconnections from homes. Oil washed off streets. 
Multiple sources, more needs to be done to track the sources.

4752 2018-06-01 21:01:40 Thing is the good folk would move south for the REAL money, and then the iscot ecconomy doesn’t get near 0.7% and simply fails.   Just like Venezuelans who can’t Eat mega valuable oil , Natz would starve.  Natural selection
4753 2018-06-01 21:01:36 Yes, i used stats to revolutionize two parts of my industry that helped lead to the low nat gas/oil prices we have now.  
But you don’t need to be an expert to read their methodology.  The daily caller article actually does exactly what your wikipedia article spoke about.
4754 2018-06-01 21:01:33 As long as you aren’t frying chicken! I’ve done it naked before and was hoping around trying to dodge hot oil.
4755 2018-06-01 21:01:32 Especially now that #Trump has started a trade war, let's not be bailing out a failed American Big Oil venture by buying for 4.5 Billion that which they were about to abandon.

4759 2018-06-01 21:01:25 that sauce before, it was hard to explain but I liked it. Oil based I believe.   It was also topped with a yummy avocado puree and a tiny lil adorable crispy purple potato chip

4760 2018-06-01 21:01:19 I just got an oil change for my car by myself for the first time and I feel like a big girl lol
4761 2018-06-01 21:01:15 A lot of oil between here and Wyoming and a lot of companies in Denver. I do title research, leasing, and surface use. Going to be beautiful night for Rockies game tonight.
4762 2018-06-01 21:01:01 Yes of course. But nukes have only been used by the USA. Russia can quite easily invade certain Baltic nations and cut off oil exports to Western Europe. The response wouldn’t be a nuke. And if there’s an invasion it would utilize tanks and other vehicles.

4764 2018-06-01 21:00:50 No se van a quedar con.OIL
Miren que la muchachada esta de acuerdo con lo que nos robo Cristobal
No armen otro quilombo
O si lo hacen que sea antes de arreglar la plaza
4765 2018-06-01 21:00:46 The most frustrating thing for me last night is how fast my down and in shot burned up. I don’t have 10,000 revs, I have three, and I should’ve been able to throw hard enough to compensate for any oil loss, but I fucking guess not

4767 2018-06-01 21:00:41 Just an FYI Gavilan College has opened an Essential Oil Class registration is open ! Register now !
4768 2018-06-01 21:00:32 Aaaahhh, this people (NDC), I don't think far? So what at all shd we use the oil money for. 
I even want the money shd be use to construct a bridge from Nkwakwa to afram plains (on Volta river)
4769 2018-06-01 21:00:30 Bad boy oil
4770 2018-06-01 21:00:16 Happy birthday sir..  More grace and more oil.
4771 2018-06-01 21:00:16 It is a series of interconnected markets for a varying quality of product. That bullshit is barely oil, and its price is a function of a buyer's willingness to take it on. Y'all got a lead order I don't know about?
4772 2018-06-01 21:00:15 Let this tea tree oil clear my skin, in the name of Jesus
4773 2018-06-01 21:00:10 June 01, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4774 2018-06-01 21:00:06 1/"Would be good(?) to hear of closed long term sales contracts..." Not how it works. Crude oil sales aren't (I don't think) like electricity contracts. Both Birn and Anderson describe how they do work in more detail in the interviews (soon to be another column)
4775 2018-06-01 21:00:06 Canada will make a lot more back from selling the product and exporting.  Oil will eventually run out and thus the provinces need ways to cut back on energy usage entirely for all parties in a few decades.  Winter heating fuel demands?  Interesting - renewables can't do the BTUs.
4776 2018-06-01 21:00:02 My family can no more get along with your family than oil mixes with water.
ぼくの家族と君の家族が仲良く過ごせるというのは，水と油が混ざるというくらいありえない話だ。

4778 2018-06-01 20:59:47 When ever I tell people I make and sell wine, castor & coconut oil men does look at me like I'm some genius lmfao
4779 2018-06-01 20:59:45 Housing, daycares, car mechanics , and hairdressers are all in high demand. Took me 3 hours to get an oil change today. 2.5 hr wait at sports clips.
4780 2018-06-01 20:59:43 Sometimes u need to have a hot bath with bath bomb, teeth whitening strips, leave in conditioner and then smother yourself in body oil n just lay and let it all work it’s magic 
4781 2018-06-01 20:59:39 So, to say that Hitler is going to win the war if (insert scenario here) is just pure fantasy. Britain could stand up against Germany because simply they have all the resources of the world, oil in middle east, rare metal of south africa, etc, etc.
4782 2018-06-01 20:59:39 US action vs oil/euro traders doesn’t account for system wide illiquidity of the euro.
4783 2018-06-01 20:59:32 Hmm, pls don't hang around too much with Blair the-snake oil seller! #Ethiopia
4784 2018-06-01 20:59:31 Canada’s most pressing challenge is respecting the next 7 generations health and wellbeing and oil extraction and transportation.
4785 2018-06-01 20:59:19 Transplants, too! Especially when it rains. They have this “I know how to drive in this” mentality, but don’t realize that, bc it doesn’t rain very often here, the roads are slick with oil and way more dangerous than usual.
4786 2018-06-01 20:59:18 How does one treat a corticosteroid allergy? Would peanut oil or bee venom work?
4787 2018-06-01 20:59:10 In getting my oil changed and they trynna sale me shit but i was prepped before i got here so just change the oil man
4788 2018-06-01 20:59:00 Not to say there is no liquidity crisis whatsoever that would justify further pressure into the stock, right.. my only concern is to oil price. It seems to be reversing its recent rally
4789 2018-06-01 20:58:25 I told you rubbing lavender oil on my kneecaps would go a LONNNNNG way.
4790 2018-06-01 20:58:23 All about the oil $$$$.
4791 2018-06-01 20:58:14 Ur no oil painting
4792 2018-06-01 20:58:13 #doomsdaypreppers preparing for apocalypse means teaching your best friend how to rub oil into eggs so they last 12 months. Who knew 
4793 2018-06-01 20:58:08 @HowtoADHD soooo.....ADHD and pregnancy.   Any thoughts?  Can't take stimulants.  Both my docs say "hydration and omega-3s" (but not the fish liver oil kind...that's not good for baby.)  Ok, can do that , but still losing my mind a little over here....
4794 2018-06-01 20:58:05 Which probably means that oil companies have major investment in alternative fuel companies.
4795 2018-06-01 20:57:51 お腹いっぱいは幸福で怖い
4796 2018-06-01 20:57:49 Yeah, that oil baron is pretty harsh. I wouldn’t want to go up against that guy. #shakin’inmyspaceboots
4797 2018-06-01 20:57:39 @illuminati_xyz can you please update Lucas Oil AMA Motocross 2nd round please, thank you
4798 2018-06-01 20:57:38 Strange how I'm hearing about TOP 2 times in 2 days when I haven't thought of them in decades. I was driving along yesterday listening to Deep Tracks on Sirius XM and they played "Only So Much Oil In The Ground".
4799 2018-06-01 20:57:34 Canada just spent a $4.5billion for a pipeline that originally cost KM $550 million. Need to start the transition off fossils fuels to stop the oil subsidy burn.
4800 2018-06-01 20:57:28 Instead of eating rice all the time please try hot coco yam and palm oil with small salt inside the palm oil . Wow
4801 2018-06-01 20:57:25 Basically, oil is the very reason why German Reich declared war on the Soviets. Hitler needed the oil in the Caucasus because German Reich are simply on oil shortages. Oil from Romania just couldn't supply the huge demand of the German war industry
4802 2018-06-01 20:57:14 ...or any number of other factors that could affect outcomes, e.g geography, resources, history, population. Reminds me of the people pointing to Norway as a great example of successful social democracy while ignoring their huge oil wealth and tiny population
4803 2018-06-01 20:57:13 When the oil is exhausted, the flame goes out. — Japanese proverb [34407] #Japan
4804 2018-06-01 20:57:13 Kaya siguro madaming ayaw sa bakla kasi hindi pa sila oriented kung paano nila tayo papatunguhan. Maybe, confused din sila. If you've been to that part, alam mo how hard. It's like filling a glass of water with oil and the goal is replacing all the water.
4805 2018-06-01 20:57:03 rose oil makes me feel better than how you make me feel about myself
4806 2018-06-01 20:57:00 The higher price that it'll fetch on the Pacific Rim comes from accessing a different market,  not increased supply. Oil is not one giant unified market.
4807 2018-06-01 20:57:00 Look at all that stolen Native American lands that white people put oil pipelines through fresh drinking waters still you never learn , when it comes to keeping land clean ask the Native Americans at why they so good at keeping it clean
4808 2018-06-01 20:56:57 Like a snake oil demagogue (ccing in the expert on that subject - @SnakeOilPrez )
4809 2018-06-01 20:56:54 Question is why couldn't EUR muster the liquidity?  Was it b/c of some fault of the EUR, or b/c the US invaded the 1st oil exporter that priced oil in EUR, sanctioned the 2nd one out of the financial system, & then prevented EU banks from providing the liquidity?
4810 2018-06-01 20:56:50 It’s oil on the water if the west
4811 2018-06-01 20:56:40 Alright.
I only tried this recipe out once and used butter, but substituted it should be:
400g of almond or hazel nut flour
6 eggs
2tsp backing powder
150g sugar
Half a cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 pinch of salt
1 cup of oil (I recommend sunflower oil)
4812 2018-06-01 20:56:39 2 spoonfuls a day keeps the doctor away nice to hear from a fellow herbalist 
if u dont take organic coconut oil then i highly recomend atleast a spoonful a day 
300ml from aldi £2.30 absolute bargain and u will feel great
4813 2018-06-01 20:56:36 Mayonnaise is emulsified eggs and oil.
4814 2018-06-01 20:56:30 I also hear he's into oil byproducts. His friends call him John Reifein.
4815 2018-06-01 20:56:19 It's so muggy out that I started sweating putting oil in my car. Not changing the oil ... just pouring in a quart of oil.
4816 2018-06-01 20:56:17 So all trillions PDP budgeted & spent since 1999, what exactly did they use it to fund and complete?
Modern day wisdom have gone beyond praising Govt that cant complete projects in 16 years they were in power with abundance of oil boom....
Bilateral agreement? So PDP looted all?
4817 2018-06-01 20:56:16 One of my coworkers fixed my oil leak for free  s/o him for real

4822 2018-06-01 20:55:35 Thats where you wrong, my friend. Hitler and Stalin are just partner because circumstances, not friend. There is no Fascist and Communists could live side by side. And even if Hitler didnt declares war on the Soviet, he still going to lose the war, why ? Oil.
4823 2018-06-01 20:55:19 If u really do work on statistics.. pls can u tell me what is d cost of oil barrel in GEJ regime and PMB regime

4826 2018-06-01 20:54:58 The reason Venezuela's economy tanked is because of their extreme and almost exclusive reliance on oil, not Chavez's vaguely pro-worker policies

4830 2018-06-01 20:54:41 So... who uses plain coconut butter/coconut oil as a eye make up remover? Just read that it can clog your tear duct and is super bad for your skin?? Thoughts?! I have been issuing this for months.
4831 2018-06-01 20:54:26 I need to go get an oil change before I think about going anywhere else today
4832 2018-06-01 20:54:18 Me too!!! Kick that little girls butt!!
4833 2018-06-01 20:53:52 copy, paste 
Bill Clinton pardoned Mark Rich who was indicted on 65 criminal counts, including income tax evasion, wire fraud, racketeering, and trading with Iran during the oil embargo. Who's wife gave a huge amount of money to the Clintons. Pay for play. AGAIN.
4834 2018-06-01 20:53:47 Likewise. It'll only get muddy again. Clean and oil the moving bits.
4835 2018-06-01 20:53:45 Pls  look after  rapidly hide of oil rate sir,
4836 2018-06-01 20:53:44 Income inequality is huge in the USA. Fossil fuels are destroying the climate. Maintaining an oil supply creates wars.

Does Tesla have plans to ever release a super affordable “people’s car”?

Is it possible to create a 21st century equivalent to the Mini, Model T, 2CV, Beetle?
4837 2018-06-01 20:53:36 Rex Tillerson failed to get the sanctions lifted in Russia. That was his #1 job, When ExxonMobil pulled out of their deal to drill oil in Russia, Rex was fired a few months later. 

3. Destroy our State Department. - Rex succeed here. 

4. Take America off of the world stage.
4838 2018-06-01 20:53:22 Says a man who has relied on oil for his and his families health wealth and longevity.without it you would be riding a horse, and sitting in the gloom of a candle the oil companies should call your bluff.shut down for a month.sit back and watch your world fall to pieces
4839 2018-06-01 20:53:17 Says the man who said the age of oil is over and we will never see oil over $40 again.
4840 2018-06-01 20:53:16 I CRIED a literal oil on canvas
4841 2018-06-01 20:53:06 We use Vanilla exstract, and baby oil for masquitto repelliant, but just running through past mental notes Khole, it may help you tan quicker.
4842 2018-06-01 20:53:03 DILLY DILLY!!!
4843 2018-06-01 20:52:55 Most people forget that we have the refineries also. Mexico and Canada need to send the bulk of their oil here. Tax every Gal. Of oil mexico sends here  to pay for the wall. (Eric Bolling idea)
4844 2018-06-01 20:52:38 I've been using pumpkin seed oil in my hair. ...so far so good.
4845 2018-06-01 20:52:37 scientists are discovering coconut oil is helpful with this diabetes of the mind.
4846 2018-06-01 20:52:34 . @paulgazelka, at state GOP convention, brings up Dayton's vetoes of bills pertaining to wild rice, oil pipelines, opioid abuse, protest penalties, tax cuts. "It was sort of like everywhere we turned a good Republican plan got vetoed." Gets applause by saying, "he is done."
4847 2018-06-01 20:52:31 If this baby oil thing for removing tan doesn’t work I’ve just turned myself into a slug for 40 mins for no reason
4848 2018-06-01 20:52:27 I wish we could turn off our oil pipelines to the US.  PLEASE stand firm against this bullying tactic of Trump.
4849 2018-06-01 20:52:16 How much oil/butter can you do per cannabis plant minus the buds? meaning the stems, branches and everything except buds #CannabisCommunity #420lifestyle #cannabisoil #cannabutter #cannabis #420help #420community
4850 2018-06-01 20:52:06 Yes.  The bastard has driven down unemployment to it’s lowest number in over 50 years. The bastard has turned our oil industry into a major exporter of energy, making the USA the number one producer of energy.  Bastard! 
4851 2018-06-01 20:51:26 Decide to do something responsible today and get an oil change rather than procrastinating it like last time and it’s a two hour wait

4857 2018-06-01 20:51:02 You don't think antitrust action had any role in swinging monopoly away from standard Oil, ATT, MSFT?? That didn't happen by itself Brandon.
4858 2018-06-01 20:50:54 I bought call options on oil. If it rises I profit if it drops I save at the pump. Win/win right?

4866 2018-06-01 20:49:35 Thank you! Totally unrelated, re your diary comic the other day, I’ve been meaning to message you to say the guy in the pot store congratulated me on using the same cbd oil as his mom.

“I laugh like I’ve got gold mines Diggin’ in my own backyard.”
4868 2018-06-01 20:49:18 Please where can I get lavender oil in Abuja? I couldn't find it in the whole of KD. 
4869 2018-06-01 20:49:10 I think it depends on the movie theater, because I worked at an AMC in Florida and we popped it fresh about twenty minutes before first movie (initially with coconut oil, which was why it was delicious and 1 MILLION calories). Later with corn oil.
4870 2018-06-01 20:48:59 No OIL, No LIFE!!!

4875 2018-06-01 20:48:24 Ohhh lol most of the time I wear braids, but when I wear my hair out I just deep condition it once a week. I use a hair mask and whatever oil I have, and I use a blow dryer while it’s conditioning to apply heat. That’s really it fr.

4878 2018-06-01 20:47:56 At this point it’s 70/30 against @JustinTrudeau being tough enough so far. Just a thought Justin, we supply the majority of the US’s oil import needs. Any thought of a price increase/barrel along with the already quoted tariffs? This isn’t just Trump, it’s the spineless @GOP too
4879 2018-06-01 20:47:50 Heck even in Ft. Mac they built things faster, and not the oil, the city road crews. Saw a sewer/water replacement/sidewalks/lawns move amazingly fast through my parents neighbourhood. Weeks not months.
4880 2018-06-01 20:47:45 Haha, please sell me more snake oil. For real, if you want to be successful your product needs to be better than bullshit. Have a great life, player.

4883 2018-06-01 20:47:23 No, they will not be affordable, safe, or effective. You may as well give your life savings to a snake oil salesmen. That’s basically what trump is anyway. We need to fully fund the FDA to speed up approvals of thoroughly tested drugs that are safe and effective.
4884 2018-06-01 20:47:07 Thanks, Craig, for the new installment! It's time to get back and listen again starting from the Columbus Day while waiting for an audible version. Tell R.C. Bray to burn some midnight oil, will ya?

4886 2018-06-01 20:47:06 What do you do? Just season, oil, cook it down?
4887 2018-06-01 20:46:46 Everyone thinks that you have to be against EV's or working for "big oil" if your bearish on Tesla. Nope. Childish false causation. And stop comparing them to Amazon. Amzn was never structurally insolvent and comparing a retailer to a car mfgr is just asinine.

4889 2018-06-01 20:46:34 Venezuela has the world's largest known oil reserves. Plus hydropower, and undiscovered mineral wealth in the virgin forests. The current crisis is about government mismanagement and outright thievery.

4891 2018-06-01 20:46:16 I bot a Yale Real Living Key Free Touchscreen Deadbolt in Oil Rubbed Bronze (YRD240-NR-0BP) to keep “them” out of my house and now it’s like an open door! “They” recently took one shoe from 2 different pairs and some air compressor parts.
4892 2018-06-01 20:46:06 Its a gorgeous facility and a nice little racey track!!  Both Trucks/Xfinity should be there...should.  Memphis and Lucas Oil Raceway seem like no brainers to me for trucks.
4893 2018-06-01 20:45:51 Only in the movies can you see something like this take place. Enjoy the show. I'll take a large coke, some goobers and a large popcorn with a lot of that oil you call butter. Movie time.

4935 2018-06-01 20:39:17 IIUIC, if the price elasticity of oil supply and demand is a ~10% change in price for a 1% change in quantity, we only need EOR to store 10% as much C as is in the recovered oil for it to be a net positive. At > 1.1x, EOR is as good as saline CCS. Am I missing anything?

5029 2018-06-01 20:27:12 @RalphGilles Is anyone paying any attention the oil prices.  I live in houston and we plan on driving it up as high as possible.  Then will everyone want a RAM or a Jeep?
5030 2018-06-01 20:27:10 lmao this dude aint go no tweets he not real he a bot that smell like doo doo oil
5031 2018-06-01 20:26:59 My only big difference is that I’m no longer worried about peak oil.
5032 2018-06-01 20:26:45 What if a terrorist poisons the water? Or an oil spill happens somehow? Or a mass fish die off? There are 100's of ways to contaminate the water supply and they don't have a basic plan of action.
5033 2018-06-01 20:26:42 Oil will end 
but the milk will not end, God willing, and the children of the world will need it
5034 2018-06-01 20:26:41 I moisturized then did a rosehip oil face mask & wow I swear my dark acne scars are all barely there now if not gone completely I am SHOOK
5035 2018-06-01 20:26:40 YES castor oil is good too! good luck!!
5036 2018-06-01 20:26:39 After that I worked in a garage for a while doing oil changes and tire changes and I had a lot of pain in my leg, so I went to the doctor and he said my leg & ankle muscles on one side were straining an extreme amount since the ligament was worn out, so one ankle was

5038 2018-06-01 20:26:14 If science says dilbit is too dangerous to move, maybe build a refinery in the tar sands, have a national oil company, call it PetroCan and use the tar to transition off oil. Pierre Trudeau?
5039 2018-06-01 20:26:11 #PetrolPrice I think is high time we plan for a national petrol price strike??? these increases/taxes on oil/petrol is gonna kill SA
5040 2018-06-01 20:25:38 De flea the sheep in the field up the road. Boil your head in oil...
5041 2018-06-01 20:25:34 — make sure to moisturize your face!
— use a clay mask 1x a week to help remove oils from ur face 
— ALWAYS remove your makeup in the night bc if u sleep with it on all the oil and bacteria will get into your pores (ig:lmaoselfcare) 
5042 2018-06-01 20:25:31 And I gotta get the oil filter cover back on the go kart. Crankcase been exposed for awhile.

U.S. oil output jumps to record 10.47 million barrels per day...
Pope to meet with oil execs to discuss 'climate change'... 
Oh, it's naughty to produce oil? It makes non existent AGW worse?
What a coincidence and a little distraction never hurt, right?
5052 2018-06-01 20:23:46 Some people vaguely try to exchange this with an "energy theory of value", as in human-expended energy VS something like oil, the reasoning being increasing automation making that possible. Even then, though, it comes down to human labor making it possible AT ALL, so.

5054 2018-06-01 20:23:37 I’ve needed to get an oil change for over a month now. My dad really needs to teach me how to do it myself. 
5055 2018-06-01 20:23:32 I am sure that played a roll.  The vet suggested vitamin E oil to soothe it, which I have on hand.  She’s not squinting or doing anything weird with her eyes, which is a good sign.  I am just one of those overly cautious dog moms.

5064 2018-06-01 20:22:33 Don't base your economy, on a volatile commodity! Does that help? There's also oil fields in Turkey! But the barge poles are out!
5065 2018-06-01 20:22:28 I mean economic policies that prioritize private capital over public good.
I'd argue it's been effective at staving off any meaningful policy measures toward carbon reduction, including cap-and-trade.
We have a gov't flush with oil money and no national climate policy.
5066 2018-06-01 20:22:22 I posted some charts of crude oil earlier.
5067 2018-06-01 20:22:03 How generous of you to promise that some other countries will contribute money.
Are there even any more sanctions possible?
Your master, Vladimir Putin, is delivering them oil by sending tankers into the Pacific to meet up with NoKo tankers in violation of existing sanctions.

5077 2018-06-01 20:20:35 You mean the way trump earned those millions Daddy's gave him as seed money? Unlike the Obama's who have multiple degrees, worked as lawyers, a senator, OH! AND PRESIDENT! Who KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN unlike the Bush who had oil dealings with that family or did U not know that?
5078 2018-06-01 20:20:32 Yes. Electricity, not oil. Hydroelectricity for one.

5085 2018-06-01 20:19:56 Quien toma el control de la quiebra de OIL ? YPF ( estado argento) o sea, los que pagamos impuestos, por ende también nos hacemos cargo de pagar los sueldos de los C5N
5086 2018-06-01 20:19:52 I was an oil man for a couple years so, different viscosities get me going.
5087 2018-06-01 20:19:52 Did I read that it was food oil?
5088 2018-06-01 20:19:51 How much oil do we get from Canada again? I'd rather get it from them than the Saudis
5089 2018-06-01 20:19:43 you know about not storage tech I dont? thats the issue. energy density of oil is just stupid high.
5090 2018-06-01 20:19:43 I'm talking about privately owning infrastructure...i.e. roads, bridges, schools...not welfare. Big oil does not need our tax money. WalMart does not need our tax money. Those tax dollars should be used on things the people who pay for them use...roads, bridges, schools,water etc
5091 2018-06-01 20:19:33 Thank you so much! I use vitamin e oil for my acne and heard castor oil (I think that’s how you say it) is good for hair growth too. So I’m just going to try everything and see what works.
5092 2018-06-01 20:19:32 And on oil specifically... I’ve never heard somebody refer to themselves as a fiscal conservative yet be so clueless about global economics. Venezuelan sanctions plus withdrawing from the JCPOA has led to not enough output for our consumer and commercial demand.
5093 2018-06-01 20:19:18 And to answer your question, I’m not a fan of any of the political labels, the progressives always have this arrogance that irritates me especially on 2nd A and speech rights, but I’d take them over a snake oil salesman any damned day.
5094 2018-06-01 20:19:16 Y’all wanna lose acne scars and sunspots use avocado & vitamin E oil you’ll be good, every night before bed

5100 2018-06-01 20:18:41 This (the limitations of coal) was precisely why Jackie Fisher converted the Royal Navy to oil with the Dreadnoughts: it was a national security issue.  Except Fisher was right and Trump is wrong.
5101 2018-06-01 20:18:38 This is about electricity. Most of that money is from oil which generates les than 2% of electricity.
5102 2018-06-01 20:18:31 The international oil markets are a Zanu PF project and a product of 38 years of mismanagement 
5103 2018-06-01 20:18:29 So the gas varnished in the tank so it wouldn’t start. Figured that out but didn’t know how to drain the tank. My parents yard guy came out to help me fix it and he tipped it over and poured gas out. Now oil is in the muffler and just needs to be burned out.

5110 2018-06-01 20:17:24 The lazy man's version (not that I would know) is to use the refrigerated biscuit rolls. Unless you look closely, you not see that they are already produced in a way that you can punch out the center to create doughnuts and holes. Put some oil in a pan and fry them up.
5111 2018-06-01 20:17:20 Great details in this story - Alberta’s government had prepared a full contingency plan that included choking off oil shipments to British Columbia in three days and making an offer to buy the project by itself.

5114 2018-06-01 20:16:38 I love it when customers message me about the relief from pain they get from using our oil 
5115 2018-06-01 20:16:24 well she is kinda right tho gas is over $3 a gallon here in ny alone and on the rise still while we pump our own oil to sell to over sea countries why are the prices so high it is wiping out any amount saved by lower taxes. lower the gas prices so we can enjoy the tax cuts.
5116 2018-06-01 20:16:20 when are you going to meet with your constituents at a town hall? Or are you too busy rubbing elbows w/ oil & gas bigwigs?

shit has risen to top
sorry
5119 2018-06-01 20:15:35 "...If they won't share it?" The story is still the same, the hunt is the oil
5120 2018-06-01 20:15:21 Okay then.  But still, I do honestly regard "complete failure" as a lousy argument, since the solar industry is employing more people than the oil companies, the coal companies, or the natural gas companies.  Trump's need to throw govt power against it tells you a lot.
5121 2018-06-01 20:15:20 Side note: this is the first oil I’ve ever tried and I LOVE IT. Dont plan on changing up lol
5122 2018-06-01 20:15:19 I havn't researched, but I would prefer coal over oil or fracking.. So it's possible allot of the fracking guys are going back to coal, which I would see as positive
5123 2018-06-01 20:15:13 My mom just gave an old woman a leson on what kind of olive oil to use in cooking

5133 2018-06-01 20:13:42 well... reason Big Oil is jumping in with Alternative Energy is simply a $ thing, and it's really no shocker.

New electric plants are?
Natural Gas fired instead of coal, while still a fossil fuel it's among the cleaner, why we use it in houses.

5138 2018-06-01 20:12:38 Doesn’t anyone get it! The KM mess is about stopping intensification not shutting down the oil patch. We can not meet our international obligations by building more oil infrastructure. The Greens are the only party offering an alternative to the status quo that will INCREASE jobs
5139 2018-06-01 20:12:38 Execution 2: Short USD & long real assets like gold, land, oil etc. 

Personally, I believe the best thing will be gold miners. A basket of them would be my best guess as what would perform better.

5141 2018-06-01 20:12:31 Axios revealed that leaders of the oil and gas industry, including Bob Dudley of BP and Darren Woods of ExxonMobil, and representatives of large investors including Larry Fink of BlackRock, would be meeting #PopeFrancis next week to discuss #climatechange.

5147 2018-06-01 20:11:36 Totally agree. We need more oil tanker environmental guys! I have said before it's whatever is authentic for each person to do  not everyone is an activist but within everyone there is something however small would be a move in the right direction.

5149 2018-06-01 20:11:03 Um... If you don’t think that the hand-picked Federal Reserve chair of Donald Trump and his decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal doesn’t have an effect on both the fed rates and oil prices you shouldn’t be commenting on this tweet.
5150 2018-06-01 20:10:56 Ahem. Americans are not picking on Canada, Trump is and his followers 
Like this Floridian nattering on about agriculture. Some Floridians like Trump because he has hotel resort and golf course. This is why coastal oil exploration is banned in Florida but open everywhere else.
5151 2018-06-01 20:10:55 Earth (Oil), Wind and Fire (Solar), have done some good things together.

5159 2018-06-01 20:09:49 Completely agree. None of my grandparents are here. My own parents (dad is 82) seem to just accept it. Makes my blood boil. I don't want this in my life. I'm going to duck out of it because we have been sold out for oil. It's all about money. We have all been sold down the river

But did some1 askd #RahulGandhi that the loan of 6.7 billion dollar of Oil purchased from #Iran during congress rule which is left upon the present govt., who will pay that debt? His Mother ?
5166 2018-06-01 20:09:00 Uma solução poderia ser uma proposta de fragmentação da Petrobras, tipo o que aconteceu com a Standard Oil
5167 2018-06-01 20:08:54 An excuse to give more money to the coal and oil companies, no doubt.
5168 2018-06-01 20:08:49 The trillion borrow was to stabilized the economic as a result of the recession caused by years of looting and fall in crude oil price. The last time we had recession there was enough money which serve as buffer, this time ur govt looted everything.
5169 2018-06-01 20:08:27 You an ass Trump. You think Canada is screwing the US, think again. You buy our oil cheap, you sell it back a large profits once it's been refined. You bring our aluminum to the US then sell it back to Canadian business at extreme costs. Your about to put Americans out of work.

5177 2018-06-01 20:07:16 Oil is actually oil & gas and gas can augment renewables, is also not considered baseline fuel as coal is.
5178 2018-06-01 20:07:14 After all the volatility during this shortened trading week, the DOW ended a bit lower, SP about flat, and the NASDAQ a bit higher. Oil declines and trade war fears persists as historic talks with North Korea open.

5180 2018-06-01 20:07:09 I enjoyed that RMQ tribute video. Did you switch to oil based when working a layer of colour over the water-based goauche?
5181 2018-06-01 20:07:06 Cloud iridescence is the occurrence of colors in a cloud similar to those seen in oil films on puddles, located in the general vicinity of the sun or moon. It is a fairly common phenomenon, most often observed in altocumulus, cirrocumulus, lenticular clouds and cirrus clouds.
5182 2018-06-01 20:06:53 Oil & coal want to keep our dependence upon oil & coal.

5186 2018-06-01 20:05:50 Where to get cbd oil in Fort Worth???
5187 2018-06-01 20:05:48 It said eat...you cant eat it raw but you can take raw weed and throw it in some cake or cookies batter and it works the same you don't need butter or oil or wax.
5188 2018-06-01 20:05:47 You can’t get oil from waterspout ...but you can get milk from almonds ?? ..Please explain yourself
5189 2018-06-01 20:05:45 Some grocery store ones are some kind of whipped edible oil, ugh!
5190 2018-06-01 20:05:34 These old robot bones need some oil again.
5191 2018-06-01 20:05:32 Pope to meet with oil execs to discuss 'climate change'...
5192 2018-06-01 20:05:15 Thanks for the oil change, tints, new battery AND new ac filter  but leave me tf alone now 
5193 2018-06-01 20:05:13 When you wait 3 hours for an oil change @pepboysauto what a complete joke especially since I had an appointment
5194 2018-06-01 20:05:07 OOOOO I’ll have to try the oil itself!
5195 2018-06-01 20:05:04 Your government is forcing through a pipeline that will lock in GHG emissions from the oil sands and burning of the product for decades to come. Your government thinks increasing oil sands emissions to 100Mt a year is a good thing.
5196 2018-06-01 20:04:48 Nigaassssss be takin . Nigga talking bout he got money... yeah RIGHT now. We remember when u couldn’t pay for a 5$ smell good oil . 
5197 2018-06-01 20:04:39 You're supposed to get peppermint oil, and mix it with castor or coconut oil and use it to massage your scalp. Doing that increases blood circulation; which in turn triggers hair growth.
5198 2018-06-01 20:04:35 Similar recipe...100g self raising, half tbsp olive oil, 90ml boiling water, salt and pepper. Mix, knead, roll, grill 4-6, flip, grill 2.

5205 2018-06-01 20:03:58 I just LOVE going in for a routine oil change and coming out with over $250 in charges for surprise upkeep that just comes up.
5206 2018-06-01 20:03:56 Concentrate on oil production/extraction improvements. Get Alberta and her citizens back on track to be the powerhouse it once was.

5210 2018-06-01 20:03:38 Aren't we already doing this? I thought that was the one thing most of humanity was on board with, wrecking the environment. I mean we've pretty much given Big Oil, Big Pharma, and International Banks free reign to do with us and their planet as they see fit.
5211 2018-06-01 20:03:34 Devastating. I have many of my friends that use CBD oil with excellent results.

5215 2018-06-01 20:03:20 Would need to see the evidence. Oil companies have been compromising alternatives in every single which way since 1900 or so. For example most of the wind farm pushback in Australia is oil company financed.
5216 2018-06-01 20:03:03 The New Democrats in Alberta are currently in a dispute with BC. I disagree with oil dependance and believe we need to find better energy resources, but respect that they can set party aside to fight passionately for their respective provincial interests.
5217 2018-06-01 20:03:01 If we cut off the oil, we'd be invaded tomorrow lol

5224 2018-06-01 20:02:17 Oh, you meant things like the pork?
Pork chops/schabowy i typicaly make - you hammer it like usual,
then you season it with cumin and maybe a bit of powder garlic. 
Then you put it in the egg, flour & breadcrumbs paneer.
Heat some oil in the pan, but cut it to half when you put >
5225 2018-06-01 20:02:16 "Expanding oil sands production beyond current levels could increase global emissions by 50 to 150 million tonnes CO2 annually by 2030". Perhaps this can be offset by increasing c-pricing domestically/internationally, which is the most cost-effective way to do so 3/N

5229 2018-06-01 20:02:05 Hey Phil, a clip was played today where your dear Obama was talking and said manufacturing jobs were NOT coming back!!  He was also killing the coal industry-no more!!  Susan Rice, big advocate against global warming makes millions on oil stocks!!
5230 2018-06-01 20:01:57 I’ve gotten my oil changed twice and both times something is wrong
5231 2018-06-01 20:01:54 It's so good. I mix it with coconut oil, or castor oil or any carrier oil and use it to massage my temple area and where the pain areas are on my head. Wintergreen Oil is also very good too.
5232 2018-06-01 20:01:44 Absolutely, though I think the tricky part here is balancing the availability of viable alternatives. If every skeleton is near an oil spill you can ignite... it feels rote. If you ran out of firebombs earlier and don't have a way to fight them, it feels unfair.
5233 2018-06-01 20:01:27 Arr, an end to the senseless war on whale oil is nigh. I can feel it in me bones.

5238 2018-06-01 20:00:57 I use it to help model the global oil markets in projects used by investment banks, hedge funds and governments. Enterprise enough? :) I can tell you why (as a decision maker and engineer) I embrace Laravel for enterprise.
5239 2018-06-01 20:00:49 Did I not also hear Mr Wood claim that they had reduced the cost of producing a barrel of oil by more than 50%
5240 2018-06-01 20:00:42 You can't just add a gif like that

Why is he staring at me and clenching his jaw?? Is that how you sell snake oil?
5241 2018-06-01 20:00:18 Saudi is running out of oil. America will be the next top producer and as an owner of oil royalties. I like it when the pieces go up. It’s means the economy is going up! Woohoo!!
5242 2018-06-01 20:00:07 You can also alternate between coconut oil and thick layers of aloe. 

All together thats my tried at true. Take it from someone that’s been around the block a few times. It works.
5243 2018-06-01 20:00:04 Usually I'll serve them with a lemon + sage roasted chicken, but they go with anything! They're even great served cold in a salad the next day.

They're easy to prepare too. Chop them in quarters, drizzle w/ olive oil, salt & pepper. Cook for 20ish mins until tender at 425deg.

5272 2018-06-01 19:57:24 The Liberal government put itself in this box of no pipeline or a National Energy Pipeline. As our mayor why are you partisan for "phase out AB oil" @JustinTrudeau ? 

I feel you might have a worse argument than Scheer or Trudeau
5273 2018-06-01 19:57:17 I’m sitting here while my car is getting an oil change and a mom just asked her daughter how her day was and she said she watched power rangers and this might be the cutest thing I’ve seen
5274 2018-06-01 19:57:09 Don't bet on that. Also what you are talking about is politicians masquerading as leaders. We will take bombast over snake oil right now.
5275 2018-06-01 19:57:09 If we look at the ethics of where food comes from, unless you go raw there really is little room for judging others. A lot of ‘vegan’ foods contain palm oil, which I discovered whilst doing it. The palm oil industry is a long way from squeaky clean.

5278 2018-06-01 19:56:48 Do you still take cod liver oil?
5279 2018-06-01 19:56:36 if this oil change is more than $50 im fucked
5280 2018-06-01 19:56:24 Lol i see nothing wrong with your previous statement. You can’t get dropped if you don’t get picked up, the hopping ain’t that bad just don’t get in the way.. and the oil yea that’s just our secret
5281 2018-06-01 19:56:19 It's bad that I pay no attention to what the President of United states says publicly bc all he is snake oil salesman doing what snake oil salesman do.
5282 2018-06-01 19:56:17 It’s June 1st 2018 and you aren’t hip to oil pulling yet? Smh
5283 2018-06-01 19:56:15 Yeah. Other dealership is for Kelsey's car, now I'm here for an oil change
5284 2018-06-01 19:56:12 Snake Oil Salesman? I think you mean fascist lying  cunt, no?

5287 2018-06-01 19:55:48 Go ahead and put a tarrifs on all of Canadian goods.  We are a resource rich country.  Bottom line this will only hurt the American economy and working class Americans.  Your President needs an economics class.  Make sure you add a tarrifs on hydro and oil too... putz

5290 2018-06-01 19:55:33 That's totally false. I work in oil, if you're going to speak to a topic at least do a little research
5291 2018-06-01 19:55:32 And 50,000 gallons of crude oil
5292 2018-06-01 19:55:16 Everything will cost more. Fewer kids will be educated
 More schools will get shot up. More wars will cost more. Oil will continue to spill and not be cleaned up...
5293 2018-06-01 19:55:16 Hey I remembered Joy Reid at the GOP's presidential primary debate in which she claimed we went to war with Iraq because of oil .... Oh wait my bad; that was @realDonaldTrump, nevermind!
5294 2018-06-01 19:55:00 Speaking of security issues, should not the be a tariff on imported oil, wars are won or lost because of non-secured fuel supply.  Ooh, but wait, that would cut into the big oil company profits
5295 2018-06-01 19:54:53 Oil Cos charge 6p extra per ltr to provide water,toilet n air-pressure facilities at outlets.But,it is missing in 90%outlets in India,particularly in rural petrol pumps.What minister is doing abt it?Why don't reduce profit margin of delears as first step.Coz,they donate 2 party?
5296 2018-06-01 19:54:46 That one too dey or they are on fish oil medication
5297 2018-06-01 19:54:27 Maybe she's recovering from a nip n tuck, lift, suspension work & oil change. Thoughts & prayers.
5298 2018-06-01 19:54:09 The list seems odd,when you first read it,however.When you break food products down to ingredients.Shit gets real. Tomato sauce and ketchup ? Think tomato farmers,Mayo ? egg and veg.oil producers.A LOT of farmers did in fact wake up looking at job and production losses.
5299 2018-06-01 19:54:02 How do your employees feel about $2.00 gas, winter Mexico tripa becoming unaffordable or their spouse working in oil and gas losing their jobs? “Carbon neutral” is affordable to owners, but not to the average worker. You play to Rosedale enviros but not the average Canadian.
5300 2018-06-01 19:54:00 Remember,  1 drop of synthetic oil is harmful to the DNA...

What percentage of organic is required to achieve the organic label?

What percentage of the pure label is required to achieve the pure label...

5301 2018-06-01 19:53:43 That'll be gold oil and drugs ?
5302 2018-06-01 19:53:33 Why no try portia m marula oil, but don't expect instant results. Uneven skin needs atleast 2months before you can see results
5303 2018-06-01 19:53:29 I put olive oil on everything I eat, I think I need help
5304 2018-06-01 19:53:15 at the dealership waiting for an oil change. it is full of white men.  just heard the words "mexican border" from someone's conversation.  send help.
5305 2018-06-01 19:53:14 Kilo of correct turkeyS is 1200naira, just boil (maggi 10naira, curry 20naira, onions 10naira with salt (no need buy just ask mummy michael) and fry with 100naira g.oil
5306 2018-06-01 19:53:04 Lmao y’all cause earthquakes when y’all hop, y’all love dropping folks, and the oil taste too good. How are y’all not dangerous?
5307 2018-06-01 19:52:59 Pedro Parente resigns from the Presidency of Petrobrás .

Now onto pressuring against the sell-off government — under watch for the nomination of the new Petrobrás President.

5308 2018-06-01 19:52:39 Was doing a mission in Destiny 2 to stop some Hive shaking a big oil rig type thing to pieces. My neighbours then began playing music so loud that the Rider toys on my desk began rattling.

Immersive.
5309 2018-06-01 19:52:25 Mayo is whipped eggs and oil. Many cake recipes call for eggs and oil (to keep it moist). So I can see the logic in it. But I'm a proponent for segregation of eggs and oil UNTIL they're in the batter. If they accidentally make mayo, whatever, but I won't facilitate the process.
5310 2018-06-01 19:52:22 I was supposed to just get an oil change today. Ended up getting that, tires rotated, fluids topped off, and a new air-filter. 
5311 2018-06-01 19:52:22 When I included @MBuhari in today's qunut everyone echoed a Rigorous Amin,one man,so much love
5312 2018-06-01 19:52:10 Paid off my engine, got his PJ Masks bed and his PJ Masks toy bin. Paying my insurance, gas and oil and that's it.... Til next payday
5313 2018-06-01 19:52:06 We import oil too
5314 2018-06-01 19:51:52 Isn't fish n chips halal anyway? As long as you don't use beer batter or fry something non-halal in the oil
5315 2018-06-01 19:51:45 Bring CAKE to meetings :) Oil for good conversations that build relationships and facilitate knowledge exchange. #poweroffood
5316 2018-06-01 19:51:35 Avengers style?
5317 2018-06-01 19:51:28 Well what's better killing our planet or making oil companies take all of our oil and money? I know the Paris accord isn't followed right everywhere but atleast it's a start for us young people
5318 2018-06-01 19:51:27 That's a LOT of oil, when you stood up I was so scared you were going to slip!!
5319 2018-06-01 19:51:27 Finally an anecdote: I was told by the 3M rep not to "wear" my scope around my neck. Apparently at that time the oil from your hair would damage the tubing over time. Not sure if still true today. 
5320 2018-06-01 19:51:23 Quick queation: Is it the same oil we have in Nigeria they have in Dubai?
5321 2018-06-01 19:51:23 Yes and no. You can but you can’t use waterproof or use oil to remove makeup.
5322 2018-06-01 19:51:19 Cos we all know water is best in electrical and oil fires!
5323 2018-06-01 19:51:14 Any time anyone says "tar sands" in relation to the Oil Sands, their argument is devalued by half for attempting to emotional blackmail their audience.
5324 2018-06-01 19:51:12 Maybe I like burning oil.
5325 2018-06-01 19:51:11 @seanhannity if US oil production is up then why are gas prices going up?
5326 2018-06-01 19:51:10 Without ibuprofen and peppermint oil I’m dead I tell ya. These headaches are killing me.
5327 2018-06-01 19:51:03 Always coming at me for oil burning
5328 2018-06-01 19:51:02 Does anyone know what grade oil goes in a TTT ?
5329 2018-06-01 19:50:57 You know how many caring vegans don’t knowof all the palm oil they are using ?
5330 2018-06-01 19:50:56 Car getting an oil change and vacuumed not washing it though
5331 2018-06-01 19:50:49 Because oil and coal folks know to ‘say nice things’ to @realDonaldTrump so he’ll fall all over himself to please them. They’re mocking him and he’s falling for it. He’s so desperate to be liked. He doesn’t realize they’re playing him to feed their greed.

Pencil on wood
5333 2018-06-01 19:50:28 they don't even get - those countries were about to go under, then they struck that vein of oil in the north sea.  if not for that, sweden finland and denmark would be hurting, real bad  could not afford safety net programs.  funny how berners and trumpists don't know that.
5334 2018-06-01 19:50:22 Yep -- kinda like proclaiming June National Ocean Month and yet the Administration has spent the last year attacking monuments, sanctuaries, and trying to place oil and gas drilling operations in 90% of our offshore waters. #ProtectWhatYouLove #ProtectOurCoast
5335 2018-06-01 19:50:14 Sit down little man  @POTUS wonder how  you Trump will do without  oil and electricity  as Canada is the largest foreign supplier of oil, natural gas, and electricity to the United States    Hey @GOP @SenateDems @WhiteHouse @SenateGOP  tell Tiny how  losing Allies is not good
5336 2018-06-01 19:50:08 Blowing up the whole thing, starting over with kingdingdon & all white super humans is the goal.  Partnered w Ru,  oddly - Arabia, oil soothes.  Curiouser new Nat sec guy is deep in anti- Muslim.  Wiley coyote says WTF!
5337 2018-06-01 19:49:56 look more eurotrash . Clean up eu first with their coal and dirty oil drilling ,better yet go to Russia and China . Joe fitness take a bike .
5338 2018-06-01 19:49:46 Will enjoy marmite on rich tea biscuits - until Hovis digestives lose the palm oil.
5339 2018-06-01 19:49:38 That’s good. It’s mainly the lavender oil that caused me spots. They do though add things in that can cause a lot of irritation to a lot of people.
5340 2018-06-01 19:49:38 Wow! Didn't realise that along with all of his other awesome powers he's psychic!

What a fab super power. Next thing you know he & his cohorts will be trading on his predictions on oil, boeing, steel price changes etc before they happen!
5341 2018-06-01 19:49:36 I need my car detailed and an oil change and also 1 million dollars
5342 2018-06-01 19:49:35 Can’t say I’m gutted Emre is off, when good he’s great but too often he can be a bit “Huddlestone” like an oil tanker stuck in a pond #lfc
5343 2018-06-01 19:49:33 Target....EU.  Putin's order to Trump.  Prices for Russian steel/aluminium, oil/gas are on the rise.
5344 2018-06-01 19:49:29 Were that so he could write under oil sludge?
5345 2018-06-01 19:49:29 I look forward to the Kanye oil painting commemorating it.
5346 2018-06-01 19:49:20 By burning oil?
5347 2018-06-01 19:49:10 @bobzimmermp wake up. Nothing pipeline isn't in our interest. We are running out of rafined oil, we are paying through the roof. 
And now we are running out of rafined product.
Liberals get your shit together!
Stop selling us off to China!
5348 2018-06-01 19:49:06 It gets like that man.. I honestly want to like them as well, I use olive oil tho 
5349 2018-06-01 19:49:00 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
5350 2018-06-01 19:48:43 If food catches on fire during cooking, we turn off the stove or oven and then try to extinguish the fire with a fire extinguisher or by dropping a pot lid, baking soda,  or salt onto the fire. We never use water on burning grease or oil because it will spread the fire.
5351 2018-06-01 19:48:39 Coconut oil is amazing too. Cooking, teeth cleaning, lube. So many functions.
5352 2018-06-01 19:48:25 Don’t forget all the oil too.
5353 2018-06-01 19:48:17 Not pretending!!! Love it. Berry or coconut with a drop of lime oil. We call them mocktails! 
5354 2018-06-01 19:48:12 And always use peanut oil
5355 2018-06-01 19:48:09 Well, he didn't lead the country to war over oil (or misinformation).
5356 2018-06-01 19:48:02 Fam how is it legal to put cancer in food like rapeseed oil
5357 2018-06-01 19:48:00 Thats why you want to dump oil in it and pollute it for a real adult to have to clean up after you
5358 2018-06-01 19:47:46 Congratulations to Trump. Let the arab world hide and party with the oil .  Sleep young angle may Allah grant her a beautyfull place in Jannat. Will a muslim mother ever give birth to another Salladin?
5359 2018-06-01 19:47:43 Or they use fish oil as body cream.
5360 2018-06-01 19:47:30 Crack a physics book, bro.  The oil industry has a few they can loan you. They've read 'em cover to cover and agree that it ain't the sun, it ain't mysterious underwater volcanos, it's us burning the ancient pre-dino salad they dig up.  They just want to keep you in the dark.
5361 2018-06-01 19:47:26 That rose hip oil is beautiful x
5362 2018-06-01 19:47:23 I’m using castor oil! A friend with Afro hair suggested it. It’s just got the consistency of car oil so it’s impossible to use and then leave the house (I have a constantly gross greasy mop )
5363 2018-06-01 19:47:00 Unlike many people....president trump can chew gum and run the country too....evidence is highest employment in many years....highest employment among minority groups and in some cases highest employment in recorded history....lowest dependable in middle east oil ever....
5364 2018-06-01 19:47:00 “In #socialmedia the 'squeaky wheel' gets the oil. You have to put yourself out there, to find people who will relate or even debate with you, depending on what you are looking for.” @jessicanorthey
5365 2018-06-01 19:47:00 The Barcelona agreement which allows floods of Muslims to come to Europe Blackmailed Europe and British governments by threatening to withhold oil. They fund most of the mosques in the UK
5366 2018-06-01 19:46:55 What’s the best method to exterminate gnats from a houseplant??? I’ve used neem oil multiple times but they keep coming back #houseplants #killgnats

5369 2018-06-01 19:46:52 If your going to ship oil through America? You should use American still to make your pipe lines. That simple
5370 2018-06-01 19:46:40 Yesterday I had fresh popcorn pooped in coconut oil and it was sooooo good. Best popcorn I’ve ever had. And it had the perfect amount of butter and salt.
5371 2018-06-01 19:46:31 —it is plausible to think that agreements for China to buy more US oil & gas could meet the needs of both countries while eroding that politically painful bilateral surplus. Increased US LNG exports to China could be “meaningful for rebalancing trade”. Via @Ed_Crooks #OOTT #ONGT

5374 2018-06-01 19:46:22 @Audi Why would an A6  not have an oil dipstick? I get we want to trust computers with more responsibility but if it's wrong you've destroyed the motor.
So here I sit, with my car in my driveway waiting for the dealer to overnight one because it's a 3,600lbs paperweight.
5375 2018-06-01 19:46:16 Dear Sir @NAkufoAddo , pls let us look like we are going ahead with without aid, with brainpower and start making our own petrol. We have crude oil and the investors in Ghana to make this happen. Then we name our price. #Accra #Ghana #CountryOf1sts #PetrolPrice @AlanKyerematen
5376 2018-06-01 19:46:09 These two movies are my dream.Well all my movies are wet fantasies for me. Coming up soon. They will set your screen on fire, your mind on fire, and you will know, cinema has been such a tormenting mistress for me.The posters are on my oil paintings.

Judge: This molten lava brownie is baked perfectly....BUT, is it me or does it taste promiscuous?

Me: Yes chef that’s correct. The kitchen was out of extra virgin olive oil so I made do with olive oil.

-Apply an oil mask treatment weekly
5380 2018-06-01 19:45:52 How the hell does a bolted piece just pop off driving less than 30 miles per hour to cause oil to actually explode in my car.
5381 2018-06-01 19:45:44 POTUS scared. 30% of tax deduction taken in gas. No reason in America who produces enough oil for the country has to bow to speculation. Get gas prices back to $1.00 and charge a $1.00 federal tax for roads and bridges.
5382 2018-06-01 19:45:43 Looks delicious! :3 Fried sprouts with olive oil, sunflower seeds & sea salt is pretty bombastic too :O
5383 2018-06-01 19:45:40 Not oil? But spent billions searching for oil in the north.
Not oil? But made yourself minister of petroleum, why not minister of youths?
5384 2018-06-01 19:45:35 revisiting anwar.,

5387 2018-06-01 19:45:26 So says an Obama acolyte as  the Trump economy booms. Canada has to open up its oil production and then deal from strength.
5388 2018-06-01 19:45:04 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

5390 2018-06-01 19:44:55 Difficult final practice session for the solos due to oil on the course from an early RTC and again during the practice, sure there'll be a few frustrated riders hoping for a longer run... Tomorrow we race.
5391 2018-06-01 19:44:48 You ought to be leading the CBD oil revolution happening via Holland & Barratts  not many can tell the difference between Hemp & Cannabis
5392 2018-06-01 19:44:35 I suggest you get a grip if you think this fascist, racist lying so called president has done one single thing to benefit America.  It’s time to come down to reality and get a grip that your country is being overtaken by a snake oil salesman.  Get off the Trump Elixir.
5393 2018-06-01 19:44:18 Fun fact:  Getting oil popping onto the top of your foot while cooking hurts *WAAAAAAAAAAAAY* more than oil popping onto your hand or arm...
5394 2018-06-01 19:44:15 Bout how i need a oil change
5395 2018-06-01 19:44:06 @ResEvilfanboy and I are creating a new energy drink by combining engine oil and water. Want in, Eric?
5396 2018-06-01 19:44:00 "M. King Hubbert of the Shell Development Co. predicted [one year ago] that peak oil production would be reached in the next 10 to 15 years and after that would gradually decline." - — March 9, 1957 Corpus Christi Times (Corpus Christi, TX)
5397 2018-06-01 19:44:00 So who, if not the USA is going to defend Europe from Russian aggression- say in the Ukraine or if Russia wishes to make more in roads? Western Europe has nothing to fear, and can’t truly resist Russia since they rely on Russia for oil imports (and Arabs)

5400 2018-06-01 19:43:58 Since the US buys so much oil from Canada at such low costs to  us, maybe we should raise the costs about 200% to stop the US from taking advantage of us here in Canada.
5401 2018-06-01 19:43:29 watching @Sodapoppintv open his po box gifts is hilarious. people sending him anvil, steering wheels, car oil pans. lol. i gotta start sending people troll gifts.
5402 2018-06-01 19:43:28 These oil companies are dreaming if they think their heavily polluting dinosaurs running on petrol will still be around by 2040.The bp's estimate of 6% of electric by 2040 is laughable, a bit like the tobacco industry telling us that smoking does no harm.

5417 2018-06-01 19:41:14 2019 will see an uplift in capital expenditure by oil and gas operators....good news for industry, supply chain and Aberdeen
5418 2018-06-01 19:40:57 Coal is so bad that even OIL is against it, haha.
5419 2018-06-01 19:40:45 That was me. I bought some anyway. Figured an oil change can wait.
5420 2018-06-01 19:40:38 As much as oil in their billions of federal support annually.
5421 2018-06-01 19:40:38 And when Obama came on board, he snapped his fingers and thing went right?
Assuming you can compare both our economies. Forgetting we have o mono dependant oil economy.
My brother the man took the right steps. Things are now materializing.  The economy recuperating.

5. Reducing GDP growth to a trickle

I can't rejoice in any of those.

5437 2018-06-01 19:39:17 Scrub: Raw cane sugar or brown sugar (to assist in exfoliating your scalp), mixed with aloe Vera & a little bit of rosemary / lavender  

Moisturizer: heating up a mixture of castor oil & honey until it makes it more liquid-y & easier to get through the roots 
5438 2018-06-01 19:39:15 it is still remarkable to me that all it takes is oil, salt, and heat to make every vegetable delicious
5439 2018-06-01 19:39:10 Why do you not care about the health of children? Also, we keep pulling up more and more oil and yet our prices are not going down. And the cost of energy is NOT the reason people are poor.

5446 2018-06-01 19:38:38 Agreed! What’s worse is the governor has signed the use of CBD oil into law but the Brill family is still being prosecuted under current law. The issue here is that CBD oil didn’t work. Medical Marijuana did for their son David. Now he’s left to suffer seizures w/out his parents.
5447 2018-06-01 19:38:34 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.  

Let that sink in.
5448 2018-06-01 19:38:07 @ManxRadioTT announced a message from Race Control that the oil slick at Hailwoods was caused by an RTA earlier in the day, so why wasn't this dealt with accordingly! To many ball's ups happening this year already!! #LoveTT
5449 2018-06-01 19:37:58 Its oceans month brb gonna start deep water oil drilling in celebration
5450 2018-06-01 19:37:57 It's amazing that OIL & GAS companies are more concerned about t/ welfare of our planet than our "president" & GOP. 
Climate change will harm every single person in one way or another. 
We may not be 100% responsible, but even if it's just 10%, we need to do EVERYTHING we can!
5451 2018-06-01 19:37:54 Someone said, Nigerian youths like to do nothing and expect because we have oil that everything should be done for them!

A true illiterate will say “lazy” wasn’t mentioned! But what’s the dictionary meaning of lazy? 

An educated person just summarized what was said in one word!

5458 2018-06-01 19:37:19 Was not expecting to waste my Friday afternoon at the dealership waiting for them to change the oil in my car! Should not take two hours.
5459 2018-06-01 19:37:19 Is that why OIL was -1.65???

5461 2018-06-01 19:37:10 What "purity"? Not destroying my people's nations for exorbitant extraction of oil to dominate the entire planet?
5462 2018-06-01 19:37:06 Aye, they proper sound. Think they use a different type of oil or something? The batter is proper tasty!

5464 2018-06-01 19:36:59  whispers “really? Do you buy the lilac oil or do you make it?”
5465 2018-06-01 19:36:58 YOU DO REALIZE we need oil & coal to create new renewable energy sources? We either make it here or import. I have family in West Virginia, there was no reason to shut down coal mines that generations of families depended on. After Trump rolled back O regulation, mines opened.
5466 2018-06-01 19:36:58 I have seen places in California advertising Philly hoagies that aren't aware that the hoagie is not made correctly if you havent used enough oil and vinegar (or properly soaked the bread with it) that you cannot see it through the paper it is wrapped in  #FFStoner
5467 2018-06-01 19:36:54 Even here in Canada ... we have people going backwards toward fossil fuels instead of moving forward to clean energy, a group wanting to relive the boom times of big oil consumption.

5475 2018-06-01 19:35:34 This should give even the pro pipeline, never stop needing oil group pause for thought.  We can either figure out how to recycle, do without or how to turn plastic seafood into food.
5476 2018-06-01 19:35:33 To be fair, mayonnaise is basically just eggs and oil. And eggs and oil are ingredients of most cakes. So it's not THAT far out. It just SOUNDS weird.

5479 2018-06-01 19:34:39 I stay having to do the “my boyfriend will handle it” lie when I go get a oil change because y’all mechanics play too much! 
5480 2018-06-01 19:34:35 You can’t put on the act of “apex alpha male who does everything” then act like your girls dumb or weak bc she can’t change tire or check her own oil 
5481 2018-06-01 19:34:30 It will go away eventually. Mine was as big as that in many areas. Stress is the culprit. Avoid using hair wax din muna. Try using argan oil for styling instead.
5482 2018-06-01 19:34:29 There's a certain perception you have of a food when you taste it; and supplements tend to have a very... well, "chemical" taste that is rather hard to mask. Chicken nuggets that also taste like omega-3 fish oil capsules would just throw everything out of whack.
5483 2018-06-01 19:33:56 Go see them before they get turned into coal mines and oil wells.
5484 2018-06-01 19:33:54 The researchers used coconut oil, butter and cheese as their sources of SFA... It would be interesting to see if all type of SFAs (short vs. long, even vs. odd-chained...) have an equal effect on liver function!

5492 2018-06-01 19:32:20 Changed the oil in my car and I forgot to unscrew the plug so that the oil could drain into the oil drain pan. So guess who got to cook their fingers in almost boiling temperature oil? This guy!

5498 2018-06-01 19:31:43 It only has a population of 5.3 million. That's a lot of oil to go around.

5516 2018-06-01 19:30:03 Thanks! All new and hopefully useful suggestions. Currently using flypaper (gross) and lemongrass essential oil. Also fresh basil. This is the downside if living next to a sheep farm.
5517 2018-06-01 19:29:47 Frank went from selling snake oil to selling Trump. That’s quite the demotion.
5518 2018-06-01 19:29:35 Nice pedipath dx! But we didn’t do oil red O in this case.
5519 2018-06-01 19:29:03 I’ve heard of lots of oils referred to as being a healthy part of a diet for their fatty acids and other necessary components. Like coconut, avocado, grapeseed oil, etc.
5520 2018-06-01 19:29:02 The facts are clear: @PepsiCo has been sourcing Conflict #PalmOil from PT SPS II –– a notoriously bad actor that has allowed the continued destruction of critical forests in the Tripa peatland. Does that seem in line with PepsiCo’s “sustainable” palm oil policy?

if the UN suggested the policy,
we know it was just another attempted nail in the coffin.
5523 2018-06-01 19:28:43 Try oils. Argan oil and Jojoba oil has worked well to clear my spots. But you will see results after about 3 months of consistent use. A quick fix is steroid cream
5524 2018-06-01 19:28:12 sim, o PT é culpado da destruição da empresa, só falei que a ida do oil aos $25 também ajudou nisso ...

5560 2018-06-01 19:23:21 It’s produced in Alaska, but the refineries there are not sufficient to supply your state’s demands, so a large amount of your oil gets refined elsewhere (lower 48) and shipped back to you. Your price at the pump includes those shipping costs.

5569 2018-06-01 19:21:59 Actually No!! We created South Sudan in order to have access to oil. So The Permanent members of the Security Council have a duty of care here.
5570 2018-06-01 19:21:57 oil paint,  smudge tool use pannierkengaa polaaaa
5571 2018-06-01 19:21:50 Electric cars need power plants, which are run on coal, oil or natural gas. Electric cars are NOT non-polluting. Hydrogen cars would be.
5572 2018-06-01 19:21:50 It’s not something I wanna see in this day an age. The extremities of the lips the oil like darkness of the skin, “the jig”that comes with it. It’s all disrespectful, like we’re clowns and should dance for our bread n butter now we’ve been liberated from slavery.

5578 2018-06-01 19:20:57 We are!!! Yet you keep spending billions on agriculture, oil, exportation, etc. But nothing tangible on man power. You can't even fulfill your promises on youwin SME program and education. Who una dey deceive? #NotTooYoungToRun @ShehuSani @MBuhari @AsoRock @HMKemiAdeosun
5579 2018-06-01 19:20:49 ..and TBH who cares what Sco 'wanted' or not 300 odd years ago! A lot can happen in that amount of time, or even in the last 40 years that is more relevant to what we can be in our near future. The discovery of oil, wind power generation, growing exports of quality food/drink etc
5580 2018-06-01 19:20:41 El juez Cosentino dispuso que sea YPF quien disponga de Oil Combustibles
5581 2018-06-01 19:20:36 “Oil price is low”, “last admin stole us blind”, “yen, yen, yen”!

Suddenly none remembers:

*The avoidable time-lag in setting up a cabinet.

*The initial lack of policy direction & some ineffectual decisions, that likely scared off FDIs.

*The -ve Impact of PMB’s long absences.
5582 2018-06-01 19:20:16 You had me until you went to Harris! That's trying to combine someone trying to clean up the corruption partied with a CORP DEM. WORSE THAN OIL & WATER MIX! Give with one hand and take away with the other!
5583 2018-06-01 19:19:57 "He said oil can!"

"...oil can what??"


5584 2018-06-01 19:19:55 And the pens were filled with crude oil.
5585 2018-06-01 19:19:51 So when I bought my car I was supposed to get 3 years of free oil changes and they charged me last time and I didn’t even notice it . I needs my coins back 
5586 2018-06-01 19:19:49 You need our oil and gas, forestry, fresh water. We have allies, while you fucked yours over. We can always turn off the taps? Start putting solar panels on every building in NY state

5588 2018-06-01 19:19:42 Gary, IN is about as dystopian as Ive seen. The entire skyline is oil refineries and factories all spewing out smog with back-to-back billboards about mesothelioma settlement lawyers in front
5589 2018-06-01 19:19:40 Do you think Prince bin Salman or American drillers are trying to get oil below $66?  Why are you thanking them?  Did you thank the Saudis when oil was north of $100?  Why didn't you thank Putin as he is part of the cartel that helped cut production?
5590 2018-06-01 19:19:35 Oil at $70 a barrel - #3?
5591 2018-06-01 19:19:15 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇

5594 2018-06-01 19:18:54 Thanks babe! In such an uncomfortable place im tempted to try coconut oil! X
5595 2018-06-01 19:18:53 As it should be devolved along with oil  extraxtion tax.
It is a crime it does not come to us.
These are the 2 main reasons the unionists wontet us go.
5596 2018-06-01 19:18:52 Switched from Gouache brushes to a single oil brush and it is 

Already much faster
5597 2018-06-01 19:18:51 The whole thing is sad, no other word can I find to describe it, how much longer will Scotland have to put up with this, infantile parliament. They need to get a grip and deal with 2018 not brave heart not oil not buying votes by giving money on stupid things, sort Scotland now!
5598 2018-06-01 19:18:50 Odessa reminds me of a black and white movie of a stampede, oil boom, and D-Day truck landing beach combined into one.
5599 2018-06-01 19:18:47 Yep everyone go see them now before they are all sold off to the oil & gas boys for pennys
5600 2018-06-01 19:18:45 You know I'm just wires and gears filled with oil used to reduce the friction and metal you can't eat that you will have stomachache if you do
5601 2018-06-01 19:18:44 Petrol lawnmower starts runs for a couple of seconds then cuts out. Checked the obvious fuel & oil. Could it be the spark plug? Anyone?
5602 2018-06-01 19:18:40 I re-up in Paks but I think most places have it ... Its the Hawaiin silky argan oil range
5603 2018-06-01 19:18:39 @marklevinshow I feel so much better about our unfair relationship with China now that Trump has imposed a 25% tax on steel. Do you remember when Hillary rushed in to save the day and championed a "Windfall Profits Tax" on oil companies? I never got any of that money back, either
5604 2018-06-01 19:18:27 Oil is the reason the economy runs.
5605 2018-06-01 19:18:22 Gas prices go up during the summer because oil companies know they can get it. Supply and demand has little to do with it, but company profits do.

5607 2018-06-01 19:18:03 eating a pasta in an oil based pesto and a pasta in a red sauce w/o getting either sauce on my white tank top challenge
5608 2018-06-01 19:17:57 I bought more today...seems like the short term support at $50. I think oil price is the biggest concern for them. But they are at 52wk low, my guess is downside is limited from here
5609 2018-06-01 19:17:48 What saved the whales from being hunted to extinction for whale oil in the 1800s? Protests? Advocacy Groups? Op-Eds?      Nope.   Petroleum came along as a better alternative to whale oil and thus saved the whales. So how do we solve today's problems? Create better #alternatives.
5610 2018-06-01 19:17:34 Makes sense for Paige. Beautiful exterior, but if you pop the hood and look inside, it's complete mess. Loose wires, oil dripping, rusty motors. The true Paige experience.
5611 2018-06-01 19:17:28 Russian money and culture are like so much oil and water. Shame this and the BBC TV centre fell foul to commercial needs. London is so much of a millionaires' ghetto now. No soul left.
5612 2018-06-01 19:17:20 Hebrews 8:8 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: NOT Ishmael, his blessing is a oil rich country with over 300 princes, but the Kingdom belongs to Israel
5613 2018-06-01 19:17:19 Although I'm not a fan of fossil oil and gas, I appreciate that we are building on top of what they have built already. Thank you for the good posts and articles, I enjoy them. Have a great day =)

5616 2018-06-01 19:17:17 Lastly, oil exported to USA means it is refined in USA and sold back to BC as refined product. 70% of volume shipped by existing Kinder Morgan line is refined and ultimately used in BC now. As population increases in BC do you think that % of consumption in BC goes up or down?
5617 2018-06-01 19:17:09 Why isn’t Cannabis Oil More widely known And Used by Ouf so called Doctors in the U.S.? U Cannot Get F**K**G High from the friggin Oil, & it is Known to Stop nausea so Cancer patients can Eat

5627 2018-06-01 19:15:37 I’ve shed a tear reading that.  Cast iron anything, best ever and you just oil and heat it once a year to treat it
5628 2018-06-01 19:15:28 I think there are far worse than oil even. But I like the basic appeal to scale with that. Also tiny houses need to fuck themselves.
5629 2018-06-01 19:15:20 Where is the reserve oil they sold at half price, these criminals
5630 2018-06-01 19:15:10 I never said anything. So if you're just as bad as me, maybe.

5634 2018-06-01 19:14:34 Depending you can also try other products other than olive oil like coconut oil which you can get out of most grocery stores in large jars. Its great to experiment to get the look you want.
5635 2018-06-01 19:14:33 Ethanol is very competitive, always has been. Your funders don't care about competitive, or favorable economics. It is all oil all of the time. If you put gasoline and ethanol on the same playing field, I would listen to the discussion. Until then, it is a joke, and you know it.
5636 2018-06-01 19:14:20 This the worst part about getting a newer car. I miss $40 oil changes on my civic lol

5638 2018-06-01 19:14:13 Aye and I even went to the effort of slipping some sweetcorn & olives under the pepperoni, and drizzling a mix of olive oil, chilli and garlic over it, to sex it up... then fucked it completely 
5639 2018-06-01 19:14:07 Omg! I used to rip things like this out of pubs. Nothing more than snake oil from a good salesman. The pub ones used to have all this info on the display but all they did was held the boiler off for 30 minutes when the stat called.  That, apparently is a saving! 
5640 2018-06-01 19:14:06 Olive Oil ain't gon' be able to christen The jersey devil like them will.
5641 2018-06-01 19:13:53 It's not just about clean tools, but the right tools and the right technique. Single blade razor, proper shaving soap, finish with alum block and a natural Shea or jojoboa oil for moisture. Man could write a book on this still.
5642 2018-06-01 19:13:40 So you want to drill into the oceans to look for oil? Don't think you can do this without fouling the water and sands.

5647 2018-06-01 19:13:11 Where I am going with this is they are moving oil, natural gas, sulfur, and other petroleum products moving all day every day now to west coast. If no pipeline they will move it by rail. They have capacity to move 1.25 million bbl/day now by rail. BC will not be able to stop it
5648 2018-06-01 19:13:11 or HIGHER!!! 
Once the issue of Iran is resolved or cooled off for a while, Oil demand will stabilize and, if you watch the Stock market, the price of Oil has been going Down this week.
Down from the High of $73.00 a Gallon, to just over $62.00 a Gallon.
So, at the moment, we are
5649 2018-06-01 19:13:09 Leverage against everyone.
To make a picture complete  your have to also include Canadian oil, which will bring us to even more staggering numbers.

5652 2018-06-01 19:12:58 I hate when you send someone a text then later they text you about some other shit acting like the text message you sent them doesn’t exist and won’t acknowledge it. Keep playing with me and imma smack you with baby oil om
5653 2018-06-01 19:12:45 In your math, how does that weight against the handouts to oil?
5654 2018-06-01 19:12:39 I for one is happy to see higher pricing. The oil and gas industry has been hurt with millions losing jobs and companies going out of business.  Hoping they start new projects which will require more people, equipment and products used in exploration
5655 2018-06-01 19:12:30 Is anyone looking at what's happening in #Libya?! U know, the country NATO cdn't wait to liberate (mainly Oil) a few yrs ago?! Sounds like it's become a hell on earth especially for African migrants?!
Can't imagine Libyans being happy w/ this destruction of their country!
#c4news
5656 2018-06-01 19:12:26 If it’s just pure rosehip oil, then brand shouldn’t matter. Are you sure the mixed reviews aren’t just from people being disappointed that their faces weren’t magically fixed?
5657 2018-06-01 19:12:23 How is it every time I go to my car dealership for a service I have to end up going in and talking to the manager ? Like how... why  6 hours for an oil change and tire rotation?!
5658 2018-06-01 19:12:21 I can feel when this bitch need oil .. car be driving weak as hell lol
5659 2018-06-01 19:12:18 The smell of tanning oil is one of my favorites
5660 2018-06-01 19:12:12 The ignorant masses in your replies feed deriding Commisso as a snake oil salesman and defending the awful people running our game into the ground with nothing to back what they're saying up except their own baseless prejudices are why I'm convinced US soccer is beyond saving.

5665 2018-06-01 19:11:28 Retweeted Crimes of Britain (@crimesofbrits):

Remember Mark Thatcher, son of Margaret Thatcher, was caught funding a coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea (Africa's 3rd largest oil producer) in 2004. His punishment? A fine and four year suspended prison sentence.
5666 2018-06-01 19:11:21 Apparently I can't purchase a drum of crude oil without people asking questions
5667 2018-06-01 19:11:21 Okay, I almost wasn’t able to pay for my extra virgin coconut oil at Boots & I couldn’t pay for my favorite Thai dish cuz my Visa Card was acting up. I thought I was going nuts. It’s nice to know I’m not alone.
5668 2018-06-01 19:11:20 is so amazing! This stuff keeps me calm and relaxed. Helps me sleep better! I love the cbd vape oil! Stays on me 24/7!

5673 2018-06-01 19:11:00 President Trump did say “I’d take the oil.”
5674 2018-06-01 19:10:57 ATTENTION !

PERRY STONE - PROCLAIMED PROPHECY...?

SAID his friend HIGH HIGH HIGH up in Suadi Arabia said

They will RUN OUT OF OIL IN 4 YEARS =2022

NEVER NEVER LISTEN TO THIS MORON !!!!

All liquid levels in the earth are RISING !

It is easier to get OIL today, then yesterday
5675 2018-06-01 19:10:44 Having this (beat up) Lexus makes me realize even more how much I don’t want a luxury car. $50-$55 in the tank, $85 oil change, $x,xxx for everything . And I damn sure don’t want an American-made car.
5676 2018-06-01 19:10:39 It hot then cooking oil outside

5679 2018-06-01 19:10:13 What we are Not hearing about, is the effect that President Trump's policies of opening up of the Oil fields on the East Coast, Shale and Anwar are having in KEEPING Oil prices LOWER than they Could be right now.
Had the Policies of obama been kept in place, prices could be $5.00
5680 2018-06-01 19:10:11 Stone and the soil you're killing me killing me

5682 2018-06-01 19:09:52 Every freaking year Oil Prices  rise when summer time nears Everyone knows this even Lying Dems! The want to use this to hold Trump responsible & make him look  like he doesn't know what he's doing! How much more can Ppl take of LibDems Lyin Games? Enough already!
5683 2018-06-01 19:09:42 ORS Olive Oil Nourishing Sheen spray.
5684 2018-06-01 19:09:35 I think your numbers may be low. Not easy to find stats but looks like 250,000 bbls are moved by rail in 2018 and estimated 390,000 bbls per day in 2019. Oil export by rail has to be going to USA (that is about 170,000 bbl/day now). Oil by rail to export by ship much higher.
5685 2018-06-01 19:09:06 Holy crap. It still mystifies me that any real American can believe anything this vile, lying snake oil salesmen vomits up. Amazing that anyone still buys his act. He’s psychotic.
5686 2018-06-01 19:09:01 Blame oil prices not politics....
5687 2018-06-01 19:08:56 Yeah, my hair is rough but I’ve been sleeping in coconut oil which seems to help after a bleach ...
5688 2018-06-01 19:08:54 self love used to mean wanking off until you cldnt see properly but instagram has turned it into Fresh facemasks and coconut oil
5689 2018-06-01 19:08:50 Oh if it's under the floor boards I'll just sprinkle oil of citronella everywhere and open the windows. It's if the cats have lobbed it into a shoe or somehow shoved it under a rug. The bastards do that.
5690 2018-06-01 19:08:41 I'm mostly hated though because I'm an aggressively abrasive asshole. The only reason I'm not resorting to my old self right now is because this CBD Oil takes the edge off. The whole "you're hated" attack is years old and lost its punch when I looked at who hated me.
5691 2018-06-01 19:08:19 Yes we used to be and you are destroying our national parks and lands with your EPA, Interior and Park reg changes, all geared to poison our views, destroy soul and poison water with you mining and oil drilling initiatives.
5692 2018-06-01 19:08:17 So much better if you infuse it in oil and drizzle it on top
5693 2018-06-01 19:08:10 Idk if I really like frying with Canola oil 
5694 2018-06-01 19:08:08 Considering it's Pruitt, I admire his restraint. He could have ordered solid gold pens with the logos of all major oil companies etched on them.

5699 2018-06-01 19:07:44 We pulled another keg of Term Oil Maple Cakes into the taproom so we now can do two pours per person!
5700 2018-06-01 19:07:31 If you can supply 20 carton of castrol non-synthetic oil DM Asap..@Gidi_Traffic kindly help retweet.
5701 2018-06-01 19:07:25 And my hair too, my hairline stays intact forever because of baby oil
5702 2018-06-01 19:07:23 Who benefits from higher oil prices?  Russia and its oil oligarchs, Middle East (with oil reserves), and Koch and Mercer and other U.S. oil oligarchs.  Who is hurt?  All Americans who breathe the air, drink the water and drive.  Let's move to sustainable energy all over the U.S.
5703 2018-06-01 19:07:22 Take their oil take their gas then kick khameniees --- Freedom for Iran
5704 2018-06-01 19:07:14 @LeoDiCaprio now contact osmond family and lexington on blocks in chicago with celebrity Christina Stansberry spirit oil all omens please that limit they after cells georgette acts like she owns van tansberry with devil patricia norales
5705 2018-06-01 19:07:12 So I’m getting my oil changed and I thought I was smart by getting an iced tea for while I waited. What did dumb dumb do? She left it in the car... wow this is a day
5706 2018-06-01 19:07:11 I’m going to need  that toilet paper to turn into castor oil quickly smh .. My head is hurting
5707 2018-06-01 19:07:02 Yes it did. At first it was horrible, I was on fentanyl and morphine and I didn’t get up for almost 5 yrs. I was fighting off new reinfections of Lyme with the Oil I’m far from pain free but I’m slowly returning to the life I left 22 yrs ago. I believed I was dying
5708 2018-06-01 19:06:32 And soybean oil 
5709 2018-06-01 19:06:26 Guys baby oil is the best for your skin. I might be old but it works for my whole body
5710 2018-06-01 19:06:21 So Buhari said this?? 
Youth, not oil, are Nigeria's most important resource ' Buhari
But no any youth trend it?? 
But they trended the youths are lazy
5711 2018-06-01 19:06:17 I bought a factor50 dry oil spray. I'm living in hope as over here in the UK we normally get rain & temps of around 60°f on a HOT day.
I digress, it's called Calypso & if you buy some be careful putting on your face, it bloody stings if it goes in your eyes!! Got a gorgeous smell
5712 2018-06-01 19:06:00 It’s the knee-jerk association that any construction supporting the oil sands is bad for the environment. This will significantly reduce the carbon footprint to transport the oil. They would be using rail and trucks otherwise.
5713 2018-06-01 19:05:56 i shower everyday and have since i was a kid! i feel SUPER gross if i don’t wash my hair, so i started just conditioning to gently refresh my hair :) and when you rinse it feels brand new! (minus the total stripping of the oils) on days i shampoo i use coconut oil too
5714 2018-06-01 19:05:48 Depends on the oil make sure their not giving you a really cheap
5715 2018-06-01 19:05:43 Oil isn’t finite. It’s being created every day. 

We are, however, using it faster that it is being formed.

Your argument then isnt that ethanol can power the world, but that the world should reduce its power demand to match the supply of ethanol.
5716 2018-06-01 19:05:42 Buhari to Nigerian youths: “You are undoubtedly Nigeria’s most important resource – not oil, not agriculture, not solid minerals – but you and all of us. Your energy, intelligence and talent are what will drive and develop Nigeria, long after we are all gone.”
5717 2018-06-01 19:05:41 Jojoba oil
5718 2018-06-01 19:05:40 I put on oils all over my body when I go to bed so I try to minimize the amount of oil I get on my other sheets. Also, I honestly feel like it just feels softer and cooler. Plus my grandma always told me to use one to keep the fitted sheet and your comforter/blanket more clean :)
5719 2018-06-01 19:05:36 With hair oil in eyes XD
5720 2018-06-01 19:05:31 love how Andre the Giant called Macho Man "Olive Oil"

5722 2018-06-01 19:05:24 I’ve used almost a whole jug of saddle oil on grandpa’s saddle since I got it & I really want to fight my uncle for how he mistreated it 
5723 2018-06-01 19:05:13 Baby oil is really my best friend during the summer
5724 2018-06-01 19:05:03 The bull's back is broken this week:)
5725 2018-06-01 19:05:02 at the same time the Coconut oil prices have hit the roof at 250 Rs/ Litre from 75 an year ago. Coconut selling at 40Rs from 7/8 an year ago. Did you ask why? Only  asked why petrol is 80 against 70 in 2013
5726 2018-06-01 19:04:55 寝る時間早いせいで

5727 2018-06-01 19:04:48 Finally getting this oil change
5728 2018-06-01 19:04:47 Amin..
5729 2018-06-01 19:04:46 lol This explains your consumption of the Mountain Dew energy drinks. All that Bromonated vegetable oil. The perfect lubricant.
5730 2018-06-01 19:04:45 Yesterday I had $33.86 in the bank. After my direct deposit today, I titled&registered my car, paid insurance, got an overdue oil change, paid my student loan and credit card.... pretty close to where I started yesterday. Payday huh? Can’t wait to pay rent... with uh...
5731 2018-06-01 19:04:44 #NowPlaying Read About It - Midnight Oil
5732 2018-06-01 19:04:39 You are an idiot regarding economics, just like those complaining about oil.  Aren’t you proud that our friends, family and neighbors have jobs, and that we don’t have to depend on other countries for oil? #MAGA
5733 2018-06-01 19:04:38 Bumblebee oil I'll buy.
5734 2018-06-01 19:04:35 But does he own a washed up dilapidated oil pipe line?
5735 2018-06-01 19:04:30 Let me oil my hair and sleep..
5736 2018-06-01 19:04:21 my 22s are winchester browning both jap and belgian and ruger and older target winchester bolt, all do this
I clean after every use with hopps brush then patch till clean then light oil patch 3 times. I fire 3 rounds to clear bore before am serious
5737 2018-06-01 19:04:17 You said there was oil down. Here is the location.. Thankfully no one injured. @urgentlee
5738 2018-06-01 19:04:09 Thanks Jimboman :) She is a tough cookie. Have a good weekend T.H.O.H! Let's slay oil next week :)
5739 2018-06-01 19:03:58 I don't generally do it, but I've used recipes that called for it before and they turned out fine. Mayo is just egg and oil, both of which go in cakes all the time.
5740 2018-06-01 19:03:54 While everyone is putting on sun screen I’m putting on tanning oil 
5741 2018-06-01 19:03:52 What a shame that our current govt.sees no value in preserv.the health of our oceans so these wonderful creatures can thrive.They only care about the $$ to b made by drilling for oil.Destroying ocean habitats &destroying sonic ability of dolphins&whales by blasting b/4 drilling
5742 2018-06-01 19:03:51 Festejan los trabajadores de Oil Combustibles: YPF se hace cargo de la operación de la empresa
5743 2018-06-01 19:03:47 I have the Argan oil container, and it never caused damage to my hair or scalp. So I assumed that maybe she’s allergic to the ingredients.
5744 2018-06-01 19:03:27 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
5745 2018-06-01 19:03:15 Even without everything, ADA oil still untouchable
5746 2018-06-01 19:03:13 Trump makes the oil from the swamp snakes he purged from the DoJ and FBI.
5747 2018-06-01 19:03:01 Time for Canada to put up a wall at the Canadian / US border and turn off the oil pipelines....in fact we should also start selling our oil in Chinese Yuan.
5748 2018-06-01 19:03:01 didn't the whole mineral oil / baby oil thing mentally prepare you enough for this?
5749 2018-06-01 19:03:00 What, no whale oil reserve included?
5750 2018-06-01 19:02:55 Things Republicans are doing to ruin the economy
-when Trump is charged with obstruction of justice
-when tariffs kick in and prices rise on things we need
-when rising oil prices due to bad politics in Middle East make gas unaffordable
5751 2018-06-01 19:02:54 Also I’m pretty sure these road side iftari providers use the same oil all month long. So watch out.
5752 2018-06-01 19:02:53 Totally agree; the Aramco ipo is coming, strong oil price is the key
5753 2018-06-01 19:02:37 Last night’s dreams involved me being on board a Grand Central train as it was attacked going through a dystopian urban landscape. And then I was ‘rescued’ after deciding to go and live on a disused oil rig off the Western Isles.
5754 2018-06-01 19:02:33 Actually, I think Trump is an idiot, but the people behind the scenes are the ones who are attacking Europe with these policies. They got scared when some countries started trading (oil) in Euros and will not accept anything but obedience to the dollar. They are Fascists.
5755 2018-06-01 19:02:14 #thisisnigeria sir,  that road is the surest goldmine for every administration in this country after Oil

5757 2018-06-01 19:02:07 Coconut oil is a #FavoriteFind
5758 2018-06-01 19:02:01 I am sure she will.
5759 2018-06-01 19:02:01 First batch of oil of the year
5760 2018-06-01 19:01:59 #totp 1977? Someone was burning the midnight oil editing all the bad dangers out of this program.
5761 2018-06-01 19:01:56 Oil was RT! I also froze it. They won't be. Lots more things to check first.
5762 2018-06-01 19:01:45 Todo bien con los #YPF en el salvataje por OIL combustible pero lo que no se dice es cuando devuelve Cristobal Lopez lo "adeudado a la AFIP". En este país no todos somos iguales ante la Ley. Falta que me digan que se va de vacaciones a las Islas Seychelles 
5763 2018-06-01 19:01:41 Ordered the body oil. Can't wait to get it!
5764 2018-06-01 19:01:41 But I'm sure the we will have the same fun you guys had today next week. Encouraging moves today in oil. All great. Also interesting pop in stocks.
5765 2018-06-01 19:01:23 Much much more. So far in Syria only we discovered the remains of 1600 civilians killed by the US. This is nothing compared to the total no. What does the US do in its wars other than killing civilians and stealing oil. ISIS is a joke. They were few thousands.

5768 2018-06-01 19:01:14 I get so bothered by the tasty videos that dont move the pan around when they put oil in it and just put the steak directly on the pan when you can clearly see the oil chillin on the side.
5769 2018-06-01 19:01:14 Price of oil had dropped ten dollars a barrel yet price of gas remains high?
5770 2018-06-01 19:01:11 So many lies in this tweet. The government isn'y buying out Kinder Morgan, they are buying out the pipeline. The product has a large market. People need oil for gas, petroleum products, plastics. Shame that you have to go to such lows to get people to sign a petition. #FakeNews
5771 2018-06-01 19:01:04 Currently getting aye oil change

5774 2018-06-01 19:00:50 so lets depend on foreign oil that hasn't hurt anyone you simpleton
5775 2018-06-01 19:00:49  it’s always something which is why I avoid going unless I need an inspection or oil change
5776 2018-06-01 19:00:43 when i mentioned i got my car's oil changed yesterday two separate people were like "wow, what a responsible adult thing to do."

folks change your fucking oil
5777 2018-06-01 19:00:41 did you at least catch something to break the side window?  My sidedoor exploded spontaneously last summer while just sitting there parked.  And yes, they're hard to work on.  Need Gumby arms just to get the oil filter off.
5778 2018-06-01 19:00:40 Último mMomennto:

5779 2018-06-01 19:00:25 Tone goes full goldmansachs mode telling u USA isn't super power & monopoly keeping keys for global trade, especially oil = #petrodollar control :D Even 5 years old can see how obvious it is. He may be right for #BTC now, but tomorrow with decentr. #cryptogold USA is finished ;)
5780 2018-06-01 19:00:21 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
5781 2018-06-01 19:00:20 Also to point out. Two of the top 3 oil producing nations throttled back production to raise prices. The 3rd has done the opposite and increased production to keep the prices from skyrocketing. Who is that 3rd country? The good old USA......
5782 2018-06-01 19:00:19 A gallon of ethanol provides less energy than a gallon of gasoline.  And the cost differential between them fluctuates depending on the price of corn and oil. In some conditions ethanol may be cost competitive, but in many conditions it isn’t. /
5783 2018-06-01 19:00:16 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
5784 2018-06-01 19:00:11 Think imma try being an Instagram Hoe.

5785 2018-06-01 19:00:10 How comes I can sit out in the sun without sunscreen an afternoon and instantly turn red that night but I use tanning oil every day for weeks and barely increase a shade?!!?
5786 2018-06-01 19:00:09 As your comment suggests, its clear that companies in the oil, gas, and mining sector are willing to take risks that open them up to FCPA enforcement. The disclosure requirements of Section 1504 could deter these companies from continuing to take those risks.

5790 2018-06-01 18:59:54 Not sure how long I’m gonna be waiting for my oil change, but I honestly regret this decision and I should have done this myself tbh
5791 2018-06-01 18:59:48 I love to be told that cooking with olive oil turns the olive oil toxic. I think it's great to be told that.
5792 2018-06-01 18:59:32 Bueno una buena es verdad que ipf se quedo con oil
5793 2018-06-01 18:59:30 My grandma has carbon dioxide buildup in her lungs so I was with her and my mom in the hospital since last night. She is unconscious but stable now. If the carbon dioxide comes out of her body, she should recover. She survived her blood infection recently, so she'll survive this.

5796 2018-06-01 18:59:09 It’s fresh zaatar. Make it in a salad with lemon juice, olive oil, raw white onion and sumaq powder
5797 2018-06-01 18:58:48 Record oil  production from the US and expectations for OPEC to boost their output  has taken its toll on oil this past week. Although had it not been for  the weaker dollar,  it could have found itself trading lower still.
5798 2018-06-01 18:58:43 Lol toh Allah baki wadanda kikeso
5799 2018-06-01 18:58:38 Data is the new oil. What happens if you’re responsible for an oil spill? You get a big fine! #GDPR
5800 2018-06-01 18:58:29 Energy: pretty weak rig count this week. US total +1 (oil +2, gas -1). Haven't looked at Ohio/Utica in a while think they're 1 rig off their peak.
5801 2018-06-01 18:58:02 Crude oil prices set for a weekly gain but look indecisive amid the directional market on Friday. Brent failed to stage a recovery yesterday, with the price has settled around  the 20-DMA after a spike above $79. Market participants  already digested the latest signals from OPEC.
5802 2018-06-01 18:58:00 1/21
Lets talk about $BTC Bitcoin, oil, gold, institutional money, and illicit money (which people refrain from talking about for moral/political correctness). 

I will also try to connect dots about when 100k, 250k, 1 mil. 

Time for Lannister bombs!
5803 2018-06-01 18:57:56 Not even close. The constitution keeps my ass free. The troops we have deployed around the globe ensure that US oil and opium interests are observed by all....those machines of war do not keep US citizens safe. They keep our oil and opium safe.
5804 2018-06-01 18:57:53 Ryan since you drive around on a limousine and you don't have to worry about what you pay for gas your tax cuts although did help most Americans monthly income now we're giving it to the oil companies because our gasoline prices have doubled so just shut up
5805 2018-06-01 18:57:52 Why are we selling/transporting raw crude? Refined oil floats making clean up easier. Raw crude blobs and  sinks making clean up much harder. Create Canadian jobs here by refining it! Same with our forestry products too. Canada needs to stop selling our raw products overseas!
5806 2018-06-01 18:57:46 Will need a cross over my purple indicator for me to start pressing. I don't know can only play my levels but yes I do think one more bounce up is in the cards. Don't know for sure but taking the trigger and shot which I did. Will just be careful if oil slips its slips hard/fast
5807 2018-06-01 18:57:45 Nothing is more terrifying than getting your oil changed. Bc you come to get a simple oil change and suddenly you need 3 new tires 8 new pumps for whatever and then you just need to throw the whole car out
5808 2018-06-01 18:57:45 You're defending the ones selling the snake oil, brah.
5809 2018-06-01 18:57:43 That's only half of what we use. We should use more nat gas and not rely on foreign oil.
5810 2018-06-01 18:57:20 Dirtiest oil in the world? What American company pays you guys? You won’t find a cleaner process anywhere in the world. Canada produces about 2% of the global CO2 emissions and the OIL SANDS account for 10% of Canada’s GHG. So about 0.14% of the global emissions. #paidprotestors
5811 2018-06-01 18:57:15 i use vitamin e oil, almond oil, and vaseline to grow out my eyelashes & brush it through with an old mascara wand. it should help with eyebrows as well! brushing through with the mascara wand also helps stimulate the hair growth! i’d do it every night before bed to get best resu

5820 2018-06-01 18:56:42 I swear every time I take my car to get an oil change they always find something else that needs to be changed as well

5843 2018-06-01 18:54:14 Canada's used to getting shit on by the US in trade, look at our oil and electricity and water. Pretty major components to civilization. We're more surprised Trudeau of all people had the back bone to push back more than anything.

We're fairly numb to it, not outraged.

5846 2018-06-01 18:54:04 if the concern is for the literal heat released by burning oil, it's trivial; swamped by insolation/IR emission cycle, which is in equilibrium in any case

if it's about greenhouse, more plausibly effectuous, but we don't understand that system nearly well enough to characterize

5853 2018-06-01 18:53:26 yea that sounds about right. Politics of 45Q implementation are diverging from original policy goals for storage right now. See Hoeven/Cramer & oil backed EAC efforts. I'm hesitant to put much faith in "incidental" storage via EOR, much more needed to make this all worth it imo.

5874 2018-06-01 18:51:43 I'm reading a book on Texas oil families and how they went from nothing to millionaires practically overnight and it's absolutely fascinating to see how white people view poverty and wealth and who is deserving of respect and all these things.

5881 2018-06-01 18:51:06 Where I bought Midnight Oil and Betty Boo. To think what I could have had!
5882 2018-06-01 18:51:01 It was better than nice. I count myself very lucky to have benefited from the post-war social consensus that fell apart in the 1970s under the strain of the oil price shock etc. Our politicians could have done more to defend that legacy and they have been failing us ever since.
5883 2018-06-01 18:51:01 The oil prices are high all over the world this month. Neither @narendramodi or @RahulGandhi can control that. As a journalist, @suchetadalal should know better.
5884 2018-06-01 18:51:00 That is (a) extremely interesting! (b) still, not critical, to our discussion. The energy in oil came from somewhere. Over a long period. Releasing it quickly can only disturb the natural thermodynamic equilibrium.
5885 2018-06-01 18:50:53 11:30 why. did they out tariffs on oil???
5886 2018-06-01 18:50:47 Exactly.

5889 2018-06-01 18:50:26 @jimsinegal could US be using tariffs to purposefully create inflation (since it’s harder to do with oil now) partly because inflation helps devalue our multi TRILLION dollar national debt?

5893 2018-06-01 18:49:48 You’re sefish. 
America doesnt fight for oil, or wealth, we go to third world countries to stabilize them in hopes that they will become allies. And trade partners. 

America isnt for America.
America is for Humanity. Thats why i fight.

5895 2018-06-01 18:49:37 You mean like building energy east to refine our own oil ?
5896 2018-06-01 18:49:18 The article is another example of a prolific author who has repeatedly demonstrated that he does not understand the oil business or refining. He confuses light and heavy crude and ignores the existing refineries tuned to heavy oil that are crying for supply. #bcpoli #cdnpoli

5914 2018-06-01 18:46:19 We buy lots of your products and enjoyed them. Not anymore. 

Every part of your company uses oil. Your company would not exist if there was no oil. For you to continue without Canadian oil, you will have to use imported oil. Why do you think that is better?
5915 2018-06-01 18:46:11 Thanks Avi. I think the value in that report includes emissions from burning the oil that would travel through the pipeline, which though obviously very important, doesn't count on Canada's balance sheet (the focus of my analysis)
5916 2018-06-01 18:46:09 You’re annoyed at finishing 3rd? We’re annoyed about not winning the league at least 10 times since Fergie and oil money, annoyed that we don’t have 7 European Cups instead of just the 5. Sorry mate, different calibre. 
Thanks tho!
5917 2018-06-01 18:46:08 "Ocean in a bottle" :) I added oil up to about the second ridge, then the rest with water. Added one drop of blue food coloring and then a ton of sparkles.
5918 2018-06-01 18:45:57 I also include major conflict in the middle east. Cause oil shortages, raises price, gives T rump cover to lift the sanctions and Putin moves a lot of high priced crude. Also, sells a lot of weaponry

5960 2018-06-01 18:42:06 We are 100% self sufficient. We have lots of everything except people. But the ones we do have are outstanding. We have hydro, uranium, coal, solar, so much wood, minerals and food, we grow so much food , and we also have alot of oil. We are ok. Good luck on your end.
5961 2018-06-01 18:42:01 Or u could just say that u are all about oil & oil only, that any competition is bad?! And u missed a question, if a mandate, why can u still buy ethanol-free?

5984 2018-06-01 18:40:22 At pharmacies or pharmacy counter. I have a plant spray bottle and fill it w water and pour half bottle of oil in. I went overboard last weekend used whole bottle, son really freaks out.

5988 2018-06-01 18:39:39 You do realize the Saudis stopped the oil price hike at Trump's request right? Bad actors (who lost the Iran deal) were aiming for $200+ a barrel.
5989 2018-06-01 18:39:35 Look at the type of jobs that were created under Obama. They were mostly part time, minimum-wage jobs. Under Trump they are actually trades and oil and gas jobs. A lot better paying jobs now
5990 2018-06-01 18:39:32 I’m all for equality in the workplace. The lady that changed my oil and rotated my tires was not only knowledgeable but she was a cutie pie. #ThankYouDear #MuchRespect #KnowsMoreThanIDoAboutCars
5991 2018-06-01 18:39:31 Well just cut off the power and water. And maybe charge more for oil

5994 2018-06-01 18:39:09 You are making my point for me.
What you are saying is that is is "cheap" to use up the energy savings if a million years in a single century. And then what? Civilization collapses? Oil is finite.  i.e. not sustainable. We are using it faster than it is generated.
5995 2018-06-01 18:39:05 I attempt to make the sauce myself but im not a good cook. I just buy a large jar of diced tomatoes, and i add a bunch of basil, garlic, some olive oil, and other seasonings. I sometimes add mozzarella cheese on top bc I’m not a big lover of American parmesan. It’s powdery 
5996 2018-06-01 18:38:39 Oil breaks down the glue, u really need to massage it in tho and leave it for a bit

"We'll win easy, and then we'll have all that timber, oil and mineral wealth and we'll be bigger than Russia, too!" Bolton said.
5999 2018-06-01 18:38:21 This man really paid for my oil change and my alignment . 
6000 2018-06-01 18:38:10 The market for fossil fuel exists because we consume. Widespread implementation of solutions has not happened because consumers don’t want to just as much as the big oil companies don’t.
6001 2018-06-01 18:38:08 Any sort of oil will remove them! Baby oil or whatever
6002 2018-06-01 18:37:58 I just wish Oil of Olay would sign him to an endorsement deal already.

That or Dunkaroos.
6003 2018-06-01 18:37:48 How much oil has he got in his bastard hair
6004 2018-06-01 18:37:46 .@Wendys chili is surprisingly really good. Put cheese, crushed crackers, and their hot oil and it's 
6005 2018-06-01 18:37:21 So please tell us Mr. President, how is this acceptable from one of our allies?  Your French President, is turning a blind eye to this torture for oil!

"This distinction is important because oil is really the only fuel for which the United States depends on imports."
6007 2018-06-01 18:37:06 Maybe @ScottPruittOK bought $130 pens because they’re made out of coal and oil and gas?
6008 2018-06-01 18:37:06 @SmitaGondkar tel is so middle class, say clarified butter to match your standards since oil sounds cheap.
6009 2018-06-01 18:37:03 Animals being killed for food = factory farming/animal agriculture -> which contributes to habitat loss and many other severe environmental issues involving the same results and consequences of oil and lumber companies...
6010 2018-06-01 18:37:02 @HarryConnickJR Stop sucking? Seriously? How about taking a USEFUL pledge and stop buying bottled H2O, soft drinks, etc? What about to go containers? How about stop using gasoline& oil in cars? Hollywood Freaks!!!!
6011 2018-06-01 18:36:41 When your waiting on your oil change, when the time you have to stream with your buddy and get to your second job at the same time smh.
6012 2018-06-01 18:36:27 Canada will survive, the EU will survive, Mexico will survive. The US, with its energy policies anno 1920 (coal, oil) and so many other anti-innovations, is sinking. It won't go down, but its "emerald city" its "beacon of hope" status is gone. Trump killed it.
6013 2018-06-01 18:36:25 Really wish National Tire & Battery (NTB) had a mobile app that I could link to their system to remind me when I needed oil changes and tire rotations on our vehicles.
6014 2018-06-01 18:36:06 The Americans, "Oleg" actor, posts that there shouldn't be any profit in the petroleum industry? Maybe he should go see Deepwater Horizon and say that.  
Costa's daddy, Vladimir Putin, and his buds, sure made a ton of dough on Russian oil.

6031 2018-06-01 18:34:47 Bought a bottle of olive oil from a specialty store & had trouble getting change back into a small pocket & the old proprietor tells me, "Don't break a nail. You'll get mad."

6062 2018-06-01 18:31:13 Love to know if the anti oil peeps truly understand what life would be like without oil. Until we have better alternatives with high energy density, we’re stuck with oil. Too bad “greens” are so anti nuclear. Also too bad making solar cells pollutes so much.
6063 2018-06-01 18:31:13 Pedro Parente and his policy of oil, gas & fuel prices does not attend our national interests. They defend the interests of big oil companies, especially those that do not have their own oil reserves. Why does Brazilian oil produced with national costs need to be in US$?

Jesus.

Coal and oil are produced over millions of years, and are made up of thousands of growth seasons. You cannot replicate that energy density with a single season of corn growth. We’d be better off with a field sized solar panel.
6111 2018-06-01 18:25:25 Simple economics - supply and demand. Demand for oil is SKY HIGH as economy grows, more people r driving, more businesses r operating......
even here Trump has helped. By reversing many of Traitor Barry's restrictive drilling and transporting policies, oil is much more plentiful!
6112 2018-06-01 18:25:23 I am grateful to him and the PM.  I acknowledge that the food my family eats, the clothes we wear, our roof shingles that keep out the rain and snow, the plane that keeps my husband in the air and the vehicles that transport us ALL require oil and gas to get from points A to B.
6113 2018-06-01 18:25:20 I like turrets... I can pour oil on my enemies (or solicitors) from there..
6114 2018-06-01 18:25:12 If #DAPL started leaking, how long would it take to stop the flow of oil? Just nine minutes, says Energy Transfer Partners.
6115 2018-06-01 18:24:54 You could do something productive... or something delicious? I gravitate to tempeh. When it’s done growing, cut thin, fry it in sesame oil, brush with hoisin sauce (blue dragon ftw) and somehow... bacon?
6116 2018-06-01 18:24:39 him: wow you really smell good ... is that like a sheep smell?
me: haha yeah I cover myself in purified sheep's oil every night
him: I love you so much marry me
6117 2018-06-01 18:24:35 The Moroccan Argan Oil One Is Good Too 
6118 2018-06-01 18:24:31 The green fried ones are good too. Plus you get all the extra fat and cholesterol from the cooking oil. 
6119 2018-06-01 18:24:27 Oil will be cleared up in 10 mins and ready to go again #IoMTT
6120 2018-06-01 18:24:22 10 minutes before oil cleaned up then to get riders back to restart session #iomtt
6121 2018-06-01 18:24:21 hiiii, just gonna drop a quick, basic skincare trick if you guys didn’t already know, but using real/natural african black soap and witch hazel really will change your skin. both are cheap and will smooth out minor imperfections and control the amount of oil your face produces
6122 2018-06-01 18:24:12 I voted hells no, but to be fair, I have had it and it was tasty. It just seems a waste because isn't it the oil and eggs that make it rich? Most mayo is made of questionable quality oil, so save that stuff for the sammiches, I say, and use fresh, fabulous oil and eggs in cake.
6123 2018-06-01 18:24:09 OIL FUTURES EXTEND LOSSES, U.S. FALLS TO LOWEST SINCE APRIL

6124 2018-06-01 18:23:50 Yea, and if you need the trees for lumber, you have some really great trees in ur national forests . Just clear cut them all and you'll be good for a few years. And then once you do that, I'm sure there will be some good coal or oil underground. #TrumpIsAMoron #TrumpIsALiar
6125 2018-06-01 18:23:47 my fav rach is “vaping oil” rach
6126 2018-06-01 18:23:44 the sense of humor my relationship has created is disturbing. most of the time it is just us saying "olive oil" in different inflections until the other person laughs.
6127 2018-06-01 18:23:36 Oil at Hailwood Rise. Riders ok.
6128 2018-06-01 18:23:31 Someone please tell me why it costs so much to change the oil in a motorcycle at Steadman's in Tooele -- I hear over $80 plus the 2 quarts of oil and filer.  A lot more than the car ($29.99 includes oil and filter)....
6129 2018-06-01 18:23:31 I have been using @NaturesUltra CBD Oil for my neck pain. It works for me. Pharmaceutical grade 99.7% CBD. No side effects. I get side effects from medicines easily, so #FeelingNormal is important to me.
6130 2018-06-01 18:23:29 Just washed , oiled and aloed my my hair  aloe and oil for nutrients
6131 2018-06-01 18:23:18 Red flag in #IOMTT practice. Riders are ok. Oil on circuit needs to be cleared and track cleaned.
6132 2018-06-01 18:23:18 I seem to recall Obummer tapping our strategic oil reserves. He was soooo clueless.
6133 2018-06-01 18:23:14 Crude Oil closing without a bounce? 
Sign of the times, neither Friday Nymex close can lift it.
6134 2018-06-01 18:23:06 Asked about that, she said it's a stretch & that in terms of trade agreements affecting pipeline, NAFTA Ch.11 is more relevant, & that the real explanation is political calculation. Trudeau painted himself into corner. My feeling? Oil companies play more expert chess.
6135 2018-06-01 18:22:57 All OK just oil down
6136 2018-06-01 18:22:53 And sprayed with Pam before grilling (as if there wasn't already enough oil in donuts)
6137 2018-06-01 18:22:51 Revenue imo will be higher in Q2 just because prices for oil are averaged higher, unless oil selloff continues.  I'd recommend buying a few days before ER and then selling the inevitable rip up.  Buy rumor sell news scenario.  Their move to crude is smart. they'll sell ng land.
6138 2018-06-01 18:22:41 I have so much damn oil on that any bug that lands on me gets stuck. v similar to the mosquitos getting trapped in the sap from Jurassic Park....clevah girl
6139 2018-06-01 18:22:22 @DeptofDefense Let me take back the ridicule.  If I am trying to make progress, I would, in reality, state my opinion very forcefully...not ridicule.   Oil would be far from my mind.  Human rights would not be.
6140 2018-06-01 18:21:55 UR ALL WRONG BIDEN IS THE ONE   CONTROLLING THE GAS PRICE AS HE  RUNS THE CFR  WHO SETS THAT  GAS PRICE N OIL AND HE N ALL THE PAST PRESIDENTS SIT ON THE GAS COMMISSION SO THE INFLUENCE THE $ AND ALL GAS SHOULD BE 10 CENTS CAUSE THEY MAKE IF ALL FROM OUR SEWER!
6141 2018-06-01 18:21:54 Take some ibuprofen. Apply oil religiously until your scalp naturally loosens the braids. That should also help with the itching. Some people do dry shampoo sometimes but idk I never did

6143 2018-06-01 18:21:37 sarap matalsikan ng oil hehehe
6144 2018-06-01 18:21:37 Some people have already invested in tanks that you can put used oil in (like waste oil from fast food companies) that turn the oil into fuel you can use for your car. Just in case there is ever a gas crisis.
6145 2018-06-01 18:21:28 As a short person who hates turns and is good at underwaters, long course is superior
6146 2018-06-01 18:21:25 ITS SO TRUE THO!!! i can only bathe if i’ve showered + if i have a bath product like a bath oil or bath bomb .. AND if i’ve thoroughly cleaned the tub.. the bacteria sis ...
6147 2018-06-01 18:21:14 I have to wait for an oil change. Wahhhhh
6148 2018-06-01 18:21:13 They wanna bring back coal and drilling for oil. Good times
6149 2018-06-01 18:21:11 Oil
6150 2018-06-01 18:20:56 Good to hear no riders are injured in the red flag. But a lot of oil on track so we will remain under red flag conditions.

6160 2018-06-01 18:20:18 Process Industries like Oil and Gas, Petrochemicals, Power Generation and Distribution, Pulp and Paper, etc. are facing the opportunity to move their in-plant technologies to the next generation of Process Control Architecture.
6161 2018-06-01 18:20:17 It's also great for American oil companies now out producing OPEC on total oil. Many new jobs and exports lessening trade deficits.
6162 2018-06-01 18:20:10 you've got to make your descent, slowly, and oil up those sticky keys

Oil and gas exploration
6177 2018-06-01 18:18:55 Keeping inflation low is more important. Deficit is low because all the excise loot from Petrol, gas, low oil prices windfall. Also means he did not spend more when needed for projects to create jobs.
6178 2018-06-01 18:18:55 Incident hailwood rise, no injuries. Oil down
6179 2018-06-01 18:18:52 Haha there is no protocol yet! I just bought some vegetable oil in from home and have been experimenting. Can you drop me your email on DM?
6180 2018-06-01 18:18:49 I killed that after 4 oil changes and i started off with 0  that doesn’t last long
6181 2018-06-01 18:18:46 Then keep oil rigs, pipe lines and tankers at a minimum...
6182 2018-06-01 18:18:44 lol I forgot how much money cars take, I just got this hoe and it needs a oil change.
6183 2018-06-01 18:18:42 Literally what would we do without the service @DawnDish provides to the oil-bird-cleaning industry. We’d be up shit creek man. 

Oil birds here. Oil birds there. Oil birds all over this motherfucker.
6184 2018-06-01 18:18:35 Seriously Bill? Come on. Oil production has been increasing for years. We saw record high production levels almost every year under Obama. Trump didn’t invent fracking. He didn’t discover the oil in Texas and ND. This is a stretch, even for you as his biggest fanboy.
6185 2018-06-01 18:18:22 @TireDiscounters what is a phone number to file a claim for damage that was caused due to a oil change?
6186 2018-06-01 18:18:20 Thanks @realDonaldTrump: Oil prices are surging to the highest level since 2014 because of "fears of military action in Syria and trade conflict with China," according to GasBuddy.  Keep up the good work Mr. Prez
6187 2018-06-01 18:18:18 Hebanna does the president have the power to halt global oil price upsurge

6200 2018-06-01 18:16:41 Or maybe they simply want to delay the inevitable! Again, Water and Oil do not mix together! Funny Physics! Poor Govern should have Poor or less services! DEBT is not good!

6222 2018-06-01 18:14:48 This is very interesting, but is it just a coincidence?  How does a top or bottom in oil lead to a top or bottom in stocks about 10 years later?
6223 2018-06-01 18:14:44 Oil show! But like, olive oil. In a pan. For cooking something awesome. So, basically a cooking show.... I might currently be hungry.

6227 2018-06-01 18:14:15 And of course the US has never subsidized the dumping of agriculture products in Canada. Nor have they supported the dumping of drywall into Canada . Nor are they paying a lower price for Oil because Canada has limited access to other markets outside the US.

6253 2018-06-01 18:11:53 Lol.... Hakane kuma
6254 2018-06-01 18:11:46 @B_hundred_Hyun i was burning the midnight oil, and to see that you're finally on twitter was really a surprise and a relieve to my tiredness. baekhyun-ah oppa, you've worked hard today pls sleep well~
6255 2018-06-01 18:11:40 The olive oil that we cook with has finished and I need to make a conditioner. 
I'm going to use the one these people pray with.
6256 2018-06-01 18:11:37 Yes. we should not dependent on Russian gas or oil in Europe. On the other hand closing nuclear in Germany was huge mistake which made Germany even more dependent on Putin
6257 2018-06-01 18:11:34 From a box or scratch? People got all kinds of ways to improve a box mix, but I have never heard of adding mayo. My BIL swears by throwing in an extra egg, Mayo is oil and eggs, basically, but........
6258 2018-06-01 18:11:30 I walked into get an oil change at my dealership and walked out buying a car HAHAHAHA
6259 2018-06-01 18:11:25 US need oil to be around 70 dollar a barrel for fracking to be economical
6260 2018-06-01 18:11:24 Literally just took 2hrs to get a oil change 
6261 2018-06-01 18:11:23 Bingo. Ad campaigns depict oil coming from cartoon dinosaurs but nearly all of the bio-mass was plant life.
6262 2018-06-01 18:11:21 WTI oil at $66.19/barrel, -$0.84.
6263 2018-06-01 18:11:12 This one holds 16l of fluid. What’s with the backup plan mid oil change?
6264 2018-06-01 18:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: moist crust with stale motor oil and pineapple.
6265 2018-06-01 18:11:05 At the time of budgeting, the Gov't can (and often does) ask for money from the FED. Since America prints it's own currency, and our currency is not backed by metal (but instead backed by credit and oil - i.e. the petrol dollar) the FED can print more. (3/)
6266 2018-06-01 18:10:56 Yeah i totaly agree but you choosed the wrong time to post this statement in my eyes because it put oil into the fire :)
6267 2018-06-01 18:10:47 Yes sir, those oil rigs off California but not off Florida coast will look great and pose no environmental threat. So sure of it that @realDonaldTrump won't hear of them near prescious Mar-a-Lago.
6268 2018-06-01 18:10:45 I haven’t changed the oil to my truck in months  it’s needs to be done today or it’s breaking down
6269 2018-06-01 18:10:42 Yup, I found a simple conditioner that help with making things smooth, but then.if inuse it properly (only every few days) then oil and dandruff goes crazy :/

Maybe I just need to keep doing it so my scalp gets used to it and evens out?
6270 2018-06-01 18:10:42 And if oil goes to $100/barrel maybe they can/will.
6271 2018-06-01 18:10:35 @CarlGratiot Its a slippery slope and not becasue of all that olive oil and cheese you like on your breadsticks. Did someone stay breadsticks? mmmmmm #unlimited
6272 2018-06-01 18:10:34 ugh... that's not good. I use desert essence blemish touch stick. Pure teatree oil is too strong
6273 2018-06-01 18:10:27 PM sir think something bipol of UP Karnatka Punjab is a awaking  call for BJP.
This failure is a failer of your policies remember that time when you said on hike oil price modi is a fortunate man then why nation need a unfortunate person But today u know who is the unfortunate

6277 2018-06-01 18:10:19 Not seeing oil companies raising wages either! Some of us cut by at least 22% direct! More through other “pruning” 
6278 2018-06-01 18:10:07 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
6279 2018-06-01 18:09:55 Termasuk actually. Kalau oil based dgn milk rasanya dah dikira double cleansing.
6280 2018-06-01 18:09:52 i might just leave my car here after this oil change  tell them to keep it
6281 2018-06-01 18:09:38 trump will sell you snake oil for whatever ails you.
6282 2018-06-01 18:09:30 Chillin in big o getting my oil changed and they have wonder pets on. Bet your ass I’m singing along
6283 2018-06-01 18:09:29 If our president is a snake-oil-salesman then Brennan is the snake.  I want our president to make snake oil out of that snake, I’ll give him a penny for it even though it’s worthless.
6284 2018-06-01 18:09:29 The cryptomarket is manipulated, sure.

What about the Fiat printing.
The stock market pumped by debt.
The QEs.
The emergency liquidity on stocks the day of the brexit.
The flashcrash of DOW.
The fall and rise of oil.
The 2008 suprime.
The 2008 A+ ratings.

Fix your market first.
6285 2018-06-01 18:09:21 Think it's you that needs help.  SWF built when oil price is high, helps when it's low.
Not hard.  Just look at Norway.
6286 2018-06-01 18:09:17 Ha! Well, it’s just eggs and oil so 
6287 2018-06-01 18:09:14 So Trump your little French President friend is allowing these people to be tortured for oil?  Wow, the world is skankier with you and your friends in it!
6288 2018-06-01 18:09:12 I’ve had this problem before. #fairskin And it sounds weird, but if you massage a little olive oil into your scalp and gently exfoliate (eg with a washcloth, an old toothbrush, or something like that) it should help.
6289 2018-06-01 18:09:02 It happened every day of your Presidency in every major city. You did nothing but condemn police, drive racial unrest, pardon drug dealers
6290 2018-06-01 18:08:53 #SpiritualAwakening and  #CBDOil what a great combination! Of course they don’t have to go hand-in-hand, yet I could see that would be a natural progression. One way or the other. I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil for neck pain. Works for me! #Namaste

6292 2018-06-01 18:08:39 You're right that we've had GDP growth, but our prospects have dimmed.  When Trudeau was sworn in, CADUSD was 76 cents; today it's 77 cents despite crude oil's rise from $44 to $68. This points to worsening fundamentals for Canada -- deficits, taxes, lower business investment.
6293 2018-06-01 18:08:34 fr actual bacon be doin na trick but den i think bout alla oil it secrete in comparison lol
6294 2018-06-01 18:08:28 I literally just hopped in the shower put oil  in my hair , and it turned out perfect .

6296 2018-06-01 18:08:03 Yes..it’s eggs and oil. Try applesauce or whipped prunes..
6297 2018-06-01 18:07:54 This guy. I bet money he doesnt use cbd which does not produce a high but "has to" use the smokable mmj 
" because the oil doesnt work" wud b his story. Cuz hes a phony n just a pothead. I blocked him last night.i cant deal w ppl that refuse to accept truth n that they r wrong
6298 2018-06-01 18:07:47 Low tax to save jobs when the oil price was low.  If only we had 40 years of Sovereign Wealth Fund to rely on eh.
6299 2018-06-01 18:07:47 We’re not law abiding. I will not abide by a government that does shit like lock millions of human beings in cages because of they’re skin color. Come and take them.
6300 2018-06-01 18:07:38 Yeah cuz he sold our integrity to Iran in exchange for oil? Lol. Gas prices are fine. It's 2018. They were higher in 2002 lol.

6303 2018-06-01 18:07:23 You don’t want that greasyness now you don’t wanna leave cap with a glob of oil when he’s playing with your hair
6304 2018-06-01 18:07:19 Socialized medicine is a ponzi scheme that will wipe out an economy which should be thriving.  All the oil work in Alberta, for example, and the money is wasted in Ottawa.  Trump knows a good deal & when to invest.  Right now, Canada is a bad deal so NAFTA will get trashed. #MCGA
6305 2018-06-01 18:07:09 And they will look so nice with oil wells, mining, clear cuts, polluted waters and resorts!
6306 2018-06-01 18:06:57 @FatKidDeals any diffuser + essential oil bundle deals?
6307 2018-06-01 18:06:47 Just start drinking the CBD oil, you’ll be fine
6308 2018-06-01 18:06:42 a secret deal is been made, wasted Iranian lives and oil revenue in the proxy war in Syria, Iran got the push as well is all about oil and selling arms. the USA and Russian always working together. are not an enemy as such.
6309 2018-06-01 18:06:42 We don’t want your tainted milk and dairy products so go to hell and let’s cut our oil,  natural gas and hydro electricity to the United States!
6310 2018-06-01 18:06:41 Right, that’s too high...I hope you get some more convenient! Cause a oil change should not be that much. 
6311 2018-06-01 18:06:30 Angel’s Donuts  now I think. I did a story on them after surveillance system scammers targeted their shop. They use clean oil, and the proof is in the fresh flavor of every donut. I’m on a #KetoDiet now and shouldn’t talk like this. :)
6312 2018-06-01 18:06:28 any oils like olive oil/coconut/almond oil or honey mixed with some sugar works great as an exfoliant to remove the dry skin!
6313 2018-06-01 18:06:20 However, I’m still buying their hot oil hair treatment, it’s wondrous stuff 
6314 2018-06-01 18:06:13 Nice article! I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil for my neck pain. It works for me! I am so happy to have a natural alternative without any side effects.
6315 2018-06-01 18:06:09 Promoter of Sandesara Grp is also best frd of PC and virtue of which he got huge amount of loan for exploration of oil and gase in Africa. Then he said that he found nothing and all d money has been spent. There was not proper assessment of viability.

6319 2018-06-01 18:05:32 Make sure they give you the benedryl. It helps. Drink a ton of water. The adriomyacin will make you pee red- and could give you a UTI- so be careful. If you are up for acupuncture after- that was a godsend for me- but your call.  Get some black cumin oil. You got this! I promise.

6351 2018-06-01 18:01:13 My guess would be that someone up in your government is thinking you better not look to the US for oil!

6362 2018-06-01 18:00:29 True.. such people were happy eating dal at rs 200.
Plus they should check the term 'under recoveries'of oil companies and how they were burdened by Cong govt...and how BJP made oil companies sustainable.
Plus debt of Iran paid.
6363 2018-06-01 18:00:18 The CBD oil isn’t going to work for me. It does help me with my pain but it gave me an itchy rash so I can’t recommend it. It’s legal in all 50 states so feel free to try it but check first to make sure you’re not allergic.

6372 2018-06-01 17:59:44 Well here’s some jolly news. The oil service industry in Alaska lacks the equipment to really get after drilling up ANWR right quick. Because domestic oil service companies have focused their cap ex to serve hydraulic fracking and deep offshore in lower 48. Silver linings baby.
6373 2018-06-01 17:59:37 The internet isn't oil. It's not a finite resource. You already have tiered plans for speed, so the data cap is just a way to milk consumers for more. Your documentation even said it only affects ~2% of customers. Really going out of the way to dick over such a small number.
6374 2018-06-01 17:59:33 If you believe a damn thing they say then you're a fool and a liar. This is the same MIC that has killed millions a long side Israel in the ME for Rothchilds oil. Stop lying Jackk. Israel & the U.S protects and funds ISIS

6384 2018-06-01 17:58:25 @JustinTrudeau 

Canada, Europe, Mexico must shore up deals with each other. Impose higher tariffs on its oil to US & reconsider pipeline to US. Canada and Northern European countries should form a new union. Canada must speak out against this Trump admininistration.
6385 2018-06-01 17:58:23 Watch out folks, these stats are totally phony. A sure sign the doodoo is hitting the fan. Governments ALWAYS lie about such things. China's oil for gold push is changing everything. The dollar is deadman walking.
6386 2018-06-01 17:58:20 WINNER WINNER OIL PAINT THINNER.
6387 2018-06-01 17:58:07 I literally have all of the different eco styler gels beside the Black Castor Oil  kind, so I decided to go ahead and go buy it & had no clue it was so much more expensive than the other ones 
6388 2018-06-01 17:58:07 and you get to continue service and ice engine so your car dealers have continued income. and you still ise fuel so big oil is happy. everyone win except var owners which still get sucked dry.
6389 2018-06-01 17:58:05 Well I do it a lot,pass tru d first gate to come out from d second, beating d main road traffic
6390 2018-06-01 17:58:01 awesome!  Is that oil or acrylic?  Looks great!
6391 2018-06-01 17:57:55 Mayo is emulsified eggs, oil, and lemon juice. You wouldn't think twice about using any of those ingredients in a cake batter.
6392 2018-06-01 17:57:51 You know mayo is basically oil and eggs, which is also in cake batter. My mother used to make a chocolate mayonnaise cake which was delicious. I don't think you should just add it to your already existing recipe though, you need to find a recipe that already calls for it.
6393 2018-06-01 17:57:44 Buy Mealsumm products for 100% oil free deliciousness.
6394 2018-06-01 17:57:34 We just got some new *East Coast Sour Diesel Edible Oil Dripper- OM Extracts*
6395 2018-06-01 17:57:30 i hear you. i however would be more interested in developing a really good oil brush engine a la artrage instead of using simplistic textures for the brush strokes.
6396 2018-06-01 17:57:25 Mayo is eggs + oil, folks.
6397 2018-06-01 17:57:20 Yes o,when I'm coming from d airport, I drive tru airforce base and come out through d second gate to beat the main road traffic
6398 2018-06-01 17:57:18 We'll be taking the car in for service, and this time it needs more than just an oil change, so we might have to put it on the credit card. Still trying to get them to let us have 4 people like we were before, but lately it's just been 1 (me) in the repro center.
6399 2018-06-01 17:56:52 I just bought a cool new CD/cassette tape player! Scientology is the only true science! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
6400 2018-06-01 17:56:33 Oh dear. The sorry part of this is that you actually believe it. I'm going to assume that you do not remember UK having to be bailed out by international markets in 1970s. It was ONLY the finding of North Sea oil that saved Westminster's sorry behind.
6401 2018-06-01 17:56:24 First I use Dermalogica pre cleanse oil, then the Yes to tomatoes wipes, then I use the checks and balances cleanser I tone with the first aid beauty facial radiance pads then the origins Original Skin renewal serum and the Algenist power eye serum and
6402 2018-06-01 17:56:22 My understanding is that it makes the outside crispier than butter, but I haven’t tried it bc mayo is gross. It might be more delicious cooked tho, bc it’s oil+egg.
6403 2018-06-01 17:56:17 Depends on the oil I guess. If you went from Castrol GTX to sunflower, that's a recipe change for the best.
6404 2018-06-01 17:56:13 @David_Moscrop I feel like you might be the only person who can write a cogent piece that is read by mainstream folks that articulates how fucked up it is, from the perspective of millennials, that Canada just bought an oil pipeline, given what we know about climate change.
6405 2018-06-01 17:56:13 During War and Crisis only bullets, food, oil, and water matter
6406 2018-06-01 17:56:08 Wlh I do it,bahaushe akwai alfarma ai
6407 2018-06-01 17:56:03 @followlastma @TrafficChiefNG Lastma needs to station a traffic warden at Admiralty Road Forte Oil/Tantalisers junctions. Or traffic lights. Unnecessary gridlock all the time
6408 2018-06-01 17:55:53 Oh now you are goin to tell us how we converted .
I wounder why you are known as #indiots
Now i know why. 
& the fight in egypt is because of the oil.
Muslim countries are rich in oil. Thats why west is interfering in it & killing innocent people
6409 2018-06-01 17:55:49 Any particular oil you recommend?
6410 2018-06-01 17:55:47 Obama never united the Oil and Solar/Wind industries. Makes you think.
6411 2018-06-01 17:55:44 US hate it when other countries buy from Russia, can`t understand if its ok for US to sell arms and not other countries, its just like any other selling for money or oil just like the US does!
6412 2018-06-01 17:55:39 @3ManFront My buddy at work at Niffer's dropped something and went to grab it...  Problem was it was the fryer.  Hand deep in 375 degree oil...
6413 2018-06-01 17:55:37 Radicalism is often a result of not being heard, so, like the saying goes, the squeaky hinge gets the oil. The Feminine is by nature softer and more subtle/quiet; in a Male dominated world it is difficult for the Feminine to be heard.
6414 2018-06-01 17:55:36 With this pending trade war about to happen it not the 
USA , Canada, EU or China separately we are all in this together we need each other if you don’t think so close your borders no imports or exports your country will be in ruins in no time , NO OIL , NO HYDRO , NO WATER
6415 2018-06-01 17:55:29 # Thank God it's Friday.  A new month a new and fresh oil.  God help us#
6416 2018-06-01 17:55:26 This particular tweet with its "sarcasm" only confirms that Saudis have deliberately propped up oil price to give Leftists the chance to badmouth Modi gov. 
1)Arabs increase price
2)Make India reduce oil taxes.
3)Which means, India gives tax money to Saudis

COLONIALISM 2.0.

6418 2018-06-01 17:55:22 Clearly my internet nonsense is what hooped that oil all up and why your car needed an immediate oil change and, I mean, come on...Victory McDonalds has me written all over it
6419 2018-06-01 17:55:18 $90 for an oil change  throw the whole car away
6420 2018-06-01 17:55:14 I’ve been told I’m annoying my whole life, and I’ve always hated it, but when I want something being annoying really comes in handy  the squeaky wheel really does get the oil 
6421 2018-06-01 17:55:14 Oil companies are raising because they are doing market correction. Pls read IEA report of 2008. The Cong govt killed the oil companies and our deficit was in double digit. Since 2014, there is steady improvement. You don't want to have high deficit budget i.e. exp more than inco
6422 2018-06-01 17:55:10 @Shell does that mean you still need to clean oil spills. Especially the one in my fucking backyard
6423 2018-06-01 17:55:10 Wind power is quite important in Alberta.  Although its overshadowed by the oil sands, there are quite a few wind generators in the southern part of the Province, where the winds are highest.
6424 2018-06-01 17:55:10 I’m slicker than niggas...Like olive oil.
6425 2018-06-01 17:55:03 Masarap po siya. For me. Pero try nyo po. Wag lang iburn yung tuyo para di mapait yung oil. Hahahaha
#ALDUBasZacAndZendaya
6426 2018-06-01 17:54:51 I used to hunt quail in the Calientes, near Bakersfield. It looks like Mordor, at least when driving through the oil fields.
6427 2018-06-01 17:54:29 Secret oil fields?
6428 2018-06-01 17:54:21 Very steady away tonight for all riders @iom_tt especially with a few oil/damp patches around!
6429 2018-06-01 17:54:20 Tires, car batteries & more -> I’m working on a story today about getting your car ready for the heat 

... so I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised when I dropped my personal car off for an oil change today, there was a nail in my tire! 
6430 2018-06-01 17:54:11 Moron lol Canada is going to have to just start refining our own oil.  Its a sad time to be an American. SO glad that I'm Canadian.
6431 2018-06-01 17:54:06 Love it when I’m cooking w oil & it splashed all over me
6432 2018-06-01 17:54:01 Guess what y'all so I got my oil changed an come to find out I need brakes... Lol I had already called it tho.... So I'm getting front brakes an back brakes tomorrow an then I'm scheduled for a tune up next week.... I'm on it! Then I should be good for a lil while..
6433 2018-06-01 17:53:46 よりによって今日これかよ！って感想でしたね
6434 2018-06-01 17:53:44 Suggest a food processor and slooooowly add oil. Perfection at all times.
6435 2018-06-01 17:53:38 We do know wat drives oil prices but then hv u never heard economists telling u b4 who's responsible for the fuel hikes nd the drop of the rand inSA?
6436 2018-06-01 17:53:35 I drove through there once at night and all the lights on the oil rigs create a really interesting experience unlike anything I've seen elsewhere.
6437 2018-06-01 17:53:32 Our  oil is sold at a discount to American Oil companies then they turn around and sale their at market price go figure!
6438 2018-06-01 17:53:26 I use Johnson & Johnson’s baby oil gel.  It makes you smell like a little, but also helps with the chaffing.
6439 2018-06-01 17:53:23 $Oil is getting killed and the $usdcad just shrugs its shoulders lol
6440 2018-06-01 17:53:06 but it prints colored oil! that took some effort!
6441 2018-06-01 17:53:03 NAFTA coming out of Clinton admin killed many jobs in many industries.  Oil industry was severely impaired by the huge influx of Canadian Tar Sand crude.  Canadian imports only good for Canadian economy. Cost US trillions in economy.

6444 2018-06-01 17:52:39 Why did you need to remove my tires to change my oil??? Am I missing something or they saw a woman come in so they tryna tell me what else is “wrong” with my car?
6445 2018-06-01 17:52:31 You mean the rising of Oil prices was bcoz of Zuma? U gv too much credit to Zuma don't you think?
6446 2018-06-01 17:52:24 What always fascinated me about #oil rich Central Asian countries is their infrastructure... today’s #Baku is unrecognisable... the 1st time I went to #Ashgabat (years ago) I realised its streets were paved with Italian marble. As for the #NorthSea oil ... oh well
6447 2018-06-01 17:52:23 I was all set to get out of bed and go get Bruce this well overdue oil change and then @MsMyaG was dressed in bubbles... Damn Bruce, uve waited this long bruh...
6448 2018-06-01 17:52:21 @EmmaHardieUK first time buyer today and the lid wasn't on my bottle of facial oil bought  had a full on disaster in bedroom
6449 2018-06-01 17:52:19 He did get the oil part right. For now....
6450 2018-06-01 17:52:11 “Better than Trump” is not good enough, @AmericasPledge.  @JerryBrownGov, it's your last chance to prevent cancer and show real climate leadership by phasing out oil and gas production.  #WeAreStillIn #BrownsLastChance #StepUp2018
6451 2018-06-01 17:52:09 That camera has never been more free of dust or oil! 

6452 2018-06-01 17:52:03 2 yrs, 2 recalls @Ford. Y'all got my next oil change?
6453 2018-06-01 17:52:02 The United States continues to occupy eastern Syria so their oil can be looted and supports a regime that commits non stop atrocities in occupied Palestine. Unfortunately, the description Nazi/Zionist might very well apply to Trump.
6454 2018-06-01 17:51:55 I hate mayonnaise but I've had cakes and found out they had mayonnaise in them and they were good. it's made up of normal cake ingredients (eggs, oil, vinegar)
6455 2018-06-01 17:51:55 Ha ha ha , mayo replaces the eggs ,oil and salt. It is super moist
6456 2018-06-01 17:51:53 That's right. But, it's the oil cos that are raising the prices every day. The oil cos are central govt undertakings.
6457 2018-06-01 17:51:50 The naked beard oil is good
6458 2018-06-01 17:51:50 Told my dad I needed an oil change. He ain’t text me back. Cool. Imma just request the money on cash app

6460 2018-06-01 17:51:21 and the people that like the proximity to Marfa and Big Bend and are desperate for a good paycheck do not want to work in Oil.
6461 2018-06-01 17:51:16 It's wild how just swishing oil around in your mouth for 15 or 20 minutes a day gives you so many health benefits. I think my favorite benefit is how soft my lips get, lol. I'm very insecure about them. Always have been. So when they're soft, I feel like I'm the shit.
6462 2018-06-01 17:51:01 #lrt exactly i met milk dud ( @VanityXVixxen ) 7 months ago and we damn near two peas in pod of oil
6463 2018-06-01 17:50:55 My favorite is the real Krispy Kreme. The ones in the south. Not the crappy version they make in #California where they use some lame oil. @krispykreme
6464 2018-06-01 17:50:34 Does this mean no more oil drilling or sonic testing in our waters? If not, then your tweet isn't worth the bits it's made of.
6465 2018-06-01 17:50:34 Came to get an oil change and I look back there to see one of my tires on the ground next to the car. I hate mechanics lmfao

6473 2018-06-01 17:49:44 I know from friends who have swapped that for pain pills. I’m looking into CBD oil that Won’t get me high. Edibles or a pinch in a bowl just before bed. I’ve already gotten good results.

6481 2018-06-01 17:48:48 Patients also feel like it's too good to be true. We keep hearing about how much "care" costs while the dirty insurance hands in the pie are never exposed. We reason it's a bad doc or that we are going to be sold Ukrainian dog hair oil as a cure all when we get there.
6482 2018-06-01 17:48:40 Yes she's down as Mary Magdalene but has the anointing oil.
6483 2018-06-01 17:48:36 Lol you know what's wild? I'm oil pulling right now. You know why? Pork. I had pork, two days ago, that stressed me out the next morning to the point where I decided I had to start oil pulling again.
6484 2018-06-01 17:48:27 Shutting down or constraining major capital-intensive industries on a whim is not the way to achieve prosperity or growth. Under both Obama and Trump, the US has pushed towards energy independence, including by boosting oil production. We should definitely do the same.

6497 2018-06-01 17:47:05 As much as it could be a good thing, its not going to happen. One example - why is Trudeau and his LIEberal government INCREASING oil coming in from the Saudi's???
6498 2018-06-01 17:46:59 You can be referring to fiat, bitcoin, gold, oil, or diamonds and the unit of measure doesnt matter, these are basic economic principles. Inflation is an increase in supply of the unit, deflation is a decrease. Saving or storing takes the unit out of supply, aka deflation

6500 2018-06-01 17:46:34 Wasn’t this pipeline leaking oil somewhere recently? @JustinTrudeau spent a lot of money for something that will have to be decommissioned soon anyway. 65 year old pipeline infrastructure is going to be a hard sell back to private sector without taking massive loss.

It's  aubergine seethed in olive oil.. Then it's baked in tomato sauce and garlic. We'll have instant pot chicken with it. It smells great.
6505 2018-06-01 17:46:07 Let's catch a wink! The BJP can burn the midnight oil...scheming! It's just that the opposition is catching up with it and it's plans and strategies to some extent but am sure the BJP will come up with something novel or even devious as usual. They are still way ahead. I agree!

6512 2018-06-01 17:45:30 Ultimately, real mayonnaise (not the toxic waste of Miracle Whip) is eggs & oil. So why not just use eggs and oil? And butter. Lots of butter.
6513 2018-06-01 17:45:21 Getting my oil changed.. what will the tell me?
6514 2018-06-01 17:45:21 Hmm. I go with eggs and cheese too but none of the other crap. Bacon, brats, ground beef, pepperoni, coconut oil to up the fat. Butter, whipping cream, sour cream.

6523 2018-06-01 17:43:33 Mr Bhakt, please also see what was the oil price per barrel when petrol was 82. Why do you want to prove the wrong of Modi right? Leave the bhakti and demand your rights.
6524 2018-06-01 17:43:29 Of course I bring my car in for a simple oil change and everything else is in need of fixing.. lololololololololol
6525 2018-06-01 17:43:22 All these oil and gas people will be talking small small.
6526 2018-06-01 17:42:52 How to Hate by lil wayne and t-pain will always be raw. Wayne's bars are slicker than oil in that.
6527 2018-06-01 17:42:44 Oil industry Item. Our systems reduce the amount of oil and hydraulic oil purchased, used and disposed of and could be applied to mechanical devices ranging from gear boxes to semi-trucks; The options are endless. Also we are looking to license our products as well as partner
6528 2018-06-01 17:42:33 the first day i saw all that shit those twitters were doing i wanted to say how about you focus on taking palm oil out of your products before starting twitter beef as a marketing strategy but i blocked them instead
6529 2018-06-01 17:42:30 Literally the pills did nothing i took them for a year and my hair didn’t grow one inch. What really has saved my hair is melaleuca oil (tea tree)! Literally the only reason my hair has grown so fast
6530 2018-06-01 17:42:13 Nor without access to Tide Water for our OIL . The EU is just as protectionist or worse

6536 2018-06-01 17:41:16 That’s good to know because I literally was about to buy the pill to use with the oil cuz I like the oil. 
6537 2018-06-01 17:41:05 to be fair interest rates at 0 across the whole worlds central banks, Quantitative Easing around the globe in a race to the bottom devaluing currencies and now china, russia, saudi, iran all not using USD for oil i think these are good reasons to own bitcoin as a hedge
6538 2018-06-01 17:41:04 They can’t. They don’t have oil
6539 2018-06-01 17:41:00 I was an absolute bitch about buying extra stuff from the guy who just changed my oil and STILL left spending $70 ?!
6540 2018-06-01 17:40:47 Yes, lets cut down all of our forests to meet the lumber demand in the US. We then can open up much more land for oil and gas drilling. This will make America great again. It will look as ugly as #DonaldTrump but we will be great. #VoteBlue
6541 2018-06-01 17:40:45 First time that I can remember, oil is up... 50, 60, 70$... and Canadian dollar is falling. Something is happening with our economy and it stinks.
6542 2018-06-01 17:40:44 Where are the facts !!
Just once check the term 'under recoveries' of oil companies and how they were burdened by prev govt. And how BJP made oil companies sustainable. Plus debt of Iran cleared. Hope u read on difference in subsidies given also

6547 2018-06-01 17:40:16 Great so now I prob can’t go and see Catie tomorrow cause my mom’s like I need someone with me in the car and blah blah blah and that I’m due for an oil change and tires LIKE CHILL AND LET ME GO UGHH I might sneak there

6550 2018-06-01 17:40:13 Extremely nice. The basil oil is very handy to make plain salad somewhat less plain
6551 2018-06-01 17:40:11 No, the physics behind optics doesn't change. Once its out of sight its gone,if you can find it again no matter which means you use it wasn't ever really out of sight unless you change elevation. I can see oil rigs from home getting towed out to sea, they get shorter as they go.

6553 2018-06-01 17:39:53 All energy deals made with corrupt north eastern usa companies for cdn energy should be rescinded. All oil should stop flowing south.  We need our own refineries. The us can buy full priced goods going forward. Thanks for bringing it up
6554 2018-06-01 17:39:45 You forgot to mention @JustinTrudeau;s responsibility for the decline in global crude oil prices - oops, that was @RachelNotley wasn't it?
6555 2018-06-01 17:39:31 You do realize Canada is  the # 1 supplier of energy to the USA with the worlds second largest oil reserves after Saudi  arabia - right ? We have the right to protect our food supply as you do with your military plane purchases that must be US made only
6556 2018-06-01 17:39:29 Bouta shave this body, shower, throw some body oil on skin & go sit by somebodies pool 
6557 2018-06-01 17:39:10 Bypolls and fuel prices has no connection. I am with you on oil prices, and middle class will feel the pinch. But let's be clear, subsidy is not the route which you want to take. Govt needs more money esp to implement ambitious plan of healthcare.

6559 2018-06-01 17:38:59 Now if only Ontario had all that oil production to skew the GDP numbers and make it seem relevant to this province, or make it appear that it's somehow the result of good governance.
6560 2018-06-01 17:38:57 Everything Trump has done internationally is to either benefit his personal business or to help Vladimir Putin. After pulling out of the Paris Accord Putin was on the news smiling and happy as hell. The Iran Nuclear Deal has benefitted Russia whose major export is oil.
6561 2018-06-01 17:38:48 Hmmm the currency ... ? Oil should have more options ...
6562 2018-06-01 17:38:48 I would also credit AC power for a lot of the growth and the transition from coal as our primary energy source to oil....
6563 2018-06-01 17:38:37 WHY didn't this guy run some of His Own carbon 60 in oil, through the same filter, for comparative purposes ? He had plenty of bottles of His Own brand right in front of him .. and WHAT was this experiment supposed to prove .. anyway ?
6564 2018-06-01 17:38:33 At 1:00pm  I got a correlation sell signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLN18) and USO on my software.
6565 2018-06-01 17:38:26 Remember the XL oil pipelines? Where is that oil coming from? 

Alberta, Canada. 

It would tragically hilarious if after all the struggle by Native Americans and environmentalists to stop the pipeline, it falls victim to Trump's trade war.
6566 2018-06-01 17:38:26 accidentally flew out of LAX with oil pen in my purse... (thought I got rid of it in Cali) - arrived home to MN with a nice little surprise. No issues from TSA

6570 2018-06-01 17:38:13 @tedlieu Could you talk to whomever is in charge of the @DeptVetAffairs and ask them to stop buying fish oil because it's all rancid and do a proper study on CBD oil?

6573 2018-06-01 17:37:55 They have the authority to sell great lakes water to corporations. They have the authority to approve Canadian oil pipelines through them. May not be the ultimate but it's sure the penultimate.
6574 2018-06-01 17:37:52 Sandro so fucked he just poured vinegar over his pizza instead of olive oil
6575 2018-06-01 17:37:47 What happens if there is a massive oil leak at the oceanside port in bc who pays for the after affects residnts of bc does certainly not alberta or provinces east of bc
6576 2018-06-01 17:37:46 It really does make it moist.  It’s eggs and oil just try not to think about it
6577 2018-06-01 17:37:41 I often add mayonnaise to a cake mix. If I was going to substitute mayo, though, I don't think I'd do it for a butter cake -- only for a cake that called for oil. Blue Plate is less tangy than Duke's or Hellman's (but I'm a Duke's guy).
6578 2018-06-01 17:37:40 Well I use it with other products. But yes it has Kelp Extract which helps slow down the oil production and it has wheat protein to help nourish any dry spots you may also have. 
6579 2018-06-01 17:37:18 Eggs, oil, vinegar... that’s all mayo is. No difference in adding mayo than there is in adding Crisco or vegetable oil.

6590 2018-06-01 17:36:17 It means consumers will pay more $. His bread is buttered by the old guard: oil, gas and nuclear industries. Obama's was buttered by the utilities and environmentalists which also means we paid more $. So, not much.

The fact is that US and allies don't want Stable Middle East, as they won't have leverage over Oil anymore.
6598 2018-06-01 17:35:23 They skim every day. Food service has to film wrap fryers to keep them out of the oil at night. I remember hosing down buildings every morning to get rid of those things.  At least tons of mayflies means a healthy lake.

6603 2018-06-01 17:34:50 Does your vision include ending or drastically curbing oil & gas extraction in Colorado? Or just producing more renewable energy here while allowing for fossil fuels to be extracted, exported and burned elsewhere? #copolitics

6607 2018-06-01 17:34:27 Canadian GDP was US$1.12 trillion in 2005 (before Harper), peaked at $1.84 trillion in 2013 & has been falling ever since as oil prices (2014-5), Trudeau's policies (2016+) -- "phasing out" oilsands, higher deficits & taxes -- push our dollar lower.
6608 2018-06-01 17:34:27 If anyone needs an oil change soon, come to the one in Smyrna. There’s an incredibly sexy Nubian king working here. I just might need new tires next week. And new brakes the week after.
6609 2018-06-01 17:34:26 Good recipe. But I prefer to use olive oil.

6621 2018-06-01 17:33:15 Maybe read the article next time. It's about the shrinking disparity of heavy and light oil on the world markets, and how world refineries need stable heavy supplies. And how the US has the cheapest and most stable heavy supply because Canada heavy is land locked.
6622 2018-06-01 17:33:08 Yip an they had to extra gas first before they reached the oil and tha has taken 5 yrs

6668 2018-06-01 17:29:42 remember when jimmy carter went on national tv and announced to the world, in a few years, the world would run out of oil ? He was also a democrat.
6669 2018-06-01 17:29:41 -Okay, now boss...question. Why do we put oil on pizza sauce?
-Because it Cooks the sauce better
-Mmm....so it's pretty important....
-.......You forgot to put oil in the sauce didn't you?
-Hey now, that's a rather loaded question.
6670 2018-06-01 17:29:37 @PepsiCo has been sourcing Conflict #PalmOil from PT SPS II –– a notoriously bad actor that has allowed the continued destruction of critical forests in the Tripa peatland. Does that seem in line with PepsiCo’s “sustainable” palm oil policy?
6671 2018-06-01 17:29:29 But there is this stuff my friend uses and it helps her eyelashes grow and they are so long!! I use coconut oil and it helps mine stay long and healthy I’ve noticed

6673 2018-06-01 17:29:23 There is much discussion about the correct oil for mayonnaise. Some say safflower, some still swear by olive oil, which I think should be included in some amount. (That here may turn out to be my most controversial tweet.)
6674 2018-06-01 17:29:13 There has always been people who think of self before others.. I was born into the infancy of the NHS..

6678 2018-06-01 17:28:59 And another thing plants thrive in a high CO2 environment. Could oil possibly be a byproduct of the eaths core? Not a fossil fuel due to it's found at such great depths.

6762 2018-06-02 23:48:25 When I first went to Thailand in 1992 you hardly ever saw anyone overweight. Now it's common, particularly in cities, also outside. There's been a huge proliferation of Western junk food – cakes, cookies, donuts everywhere. Also big increase in soy oil, less traditional fats.

That tin is hilarious Did you see the bit where it says "oil based" 
6797 2018-06-02 23:43:14 Palm oil producers create the most amazing, smoking fires in clearing the land in Indonesia and Malaysia to pollute Singapore and the rest of the region. Some of this is used to produce bio-diesel to reduce CO2 emissions and save the planet.
6798 2018-06-02 23:43:08 its because oil is priced in dollars. If that changed the dollar would collapse.

6805 2018-06-02 23:42:06 It's weird that MS went total 2A now. Only reason to get a CCW is for other states
6806 2018-06-02 23:41:58 Palm oil is a failed biodiesel experiment that destroys natural forests and replaces them with carbonbagging dreams. Cattle provide milk, meat and various useful other materials. That's why.
6807 2018-06-02 23:41:53 Note to self: When putting oil in @katiehrupka car, make sure to put the cap back on.
6808 2018-06-02 23:41:50 Exactly!!! I agree completely. How can someone be “pro-life” and then not want to help people fleeing persecution? Or those with drug-addict mothers? Or those who are simply another color in another country we are fighting in some war over oil? It’s #Hypocrisy at the extreme.
6809 2018-06-02 23:41:22 Lengthy red in Heat 1 to clean up oil after it appears a blown motor on the Capelli machine
6810 2018-06-02 23:41:10 Your food's delivered on trucks that use oil & gas that arrive by pipeline. Cant wait til you start delivering by horse & wagon, stop packaging in plastic, & stop tweeting on your icky fossil fuel computer.

Your brand never hits my shopping cart again.

6811 2018-06-02 23:41:07 Thanks. Guy at the oil change place tried to get me to sell it to him because he liked the color. Not for sale buddy!
6812 2018-06-02 23:40:41 Warm bath with lavender oil and bath milk, coming right up 
6813 2018-06-02 23:40:36 みんなすけべすきね………
6814 2018-06-02 23:40:33 Ah. Well any of the above would work, or sesame oil like @StaceyinSpacey said. I'd probably personally go with sour cream (and a splash of milk if it's still too thick) just so it looks more dip-like.

6818 2018-06-02 23:39:54 I don't wash my face anymore I just rub coconut oil on it and go and my skin is the clearest it's ever been
6819 2018-06-02 23:39:37 how much oil did you put in? it only really 'explodes' if you coat the whole pan
6820 2018-06-02 23:39:35 I'll be your baby oil 
6821 2018-06-02 23:39:34 Government and common sense is like water and oil
6822 2018-06-02 23:39:30 Many were in the same situation that you say this family in Georgia was. A child who needed CBD oil, its different from THC which is the psychoactive properties of marijuana that get you "high".  But their children stop having seizures while talking the oil.
6823 2018-06-02 23:39:26 Scotland is the only country in the UK which could feed its population, have enough fuel and power and still export. We also have water, oil and renewables. We have an option to go it alone. I feel heart sorry for many people in rUK but they should not have voted Tory.

6826 2018-06-02 23:38:52 he should re-evaluate his stance on ISIS, Islamists, sharia oil and funding terrorism if he wants to be true to his supposed claims of champion to LGBT and feminists.... unless he enjoys being a #Hypocrite of major proportions!
6827 2018-06-02 23:38:26 i'm walking around with a box of oil paints for aesthetic purposes only
6828 2018-06-02 23:38:20 Warren please stop doing that cheap and shitty thing people do, claiming that because people use oil products they have no ethical agency.  It is really really fucking stupid.
6829 2018-06-02 23:38:17 If they don’t get some beard oil ASAP
6830 2018-06-02 23:37:51 You know it’s hot when your coconut oil becomes liquid. 
6831 2018-06-02 23:37:40 Hahahahaha!  My son just quit—he bought one of those vape thingees and slowly tapered the amount of nicotine until he gave it up.  He mixed it with CBD oil which he says helped with the anxiety

6833 2018-06-02 23:37:01 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
6834 2018-06-02 23:36:46 Hold up. Oil will move. Pipeline is going forward. Relax. Trudeau knows we need the sales and jobs. He may have to pay off Burnaby somehow. But I feel it can be built safer than it has been so far. Too many little spills. 
Building too sloppy fast.
6835 2018-06-02 23:36:28 Olive oil and honey on mine. Trying to be healthy!
6836 2018-06-02 23:35:53 "You know!" he calls down, trying very little to resist the temptation to laugh mirthfully. "Back in the day, I'd have you be cleaning up that oil yourself."

He lowers his tone. "With your tongue." 

...that was quite possibly the raciest tone he's ever employed.
6837 2018-06-02 23:35:32 Ask Charles Koch, he built an oil refinery in Hamburg after meeting with Hitler. They greeted him with his favorite salute.
6838 2018-06-02 23:35:30 Hello sir, could you please let us know the state tax being charged on oil? Can you not show Modi that if he can’t reduce price, you will!
6839 2018-06-02 23:35:21 Whether or not you will be my first guest on my show...... ON a serious note it should be about how cars could run on water and how the government stopped this from happening because it would ruin the oil companies.
6840 2018-06-02 23:35:09 Put tree oil under your nose, wrist and behind your neck. Vapor rub on your feet with socks on before you go to bed .
6841 2018-06-02 23:35:02 I agree, just shows the corruption and greed that is the oil industry. Environment be damned.
6842 2018-06-02 23:34:29 It's probably from the oil in the makeup. Look for foundations with less oil. And I always put powder on top of the foundation cause it kinda soaks up the oil too.
6843 2018-06-02 23:34:27 France is also stealing Yemen Oil via Total, well known fact. Frogs is the cloaked profiteer of human suffering everywhere. Ask Africans about the "colonial taxes" they have to pay!!!! First they get abused by colonialism then they have to pay large sums for their freedom!! Sick
6844 2018-06-02 23:34:27 WRT Cesar anything: get w/o dressing, ask for Oil/Vinegar. Cesar Wrap w/just vinegar (skip oil) is actually pretty awsome. Can also replace with a hot sauce for same effect.
6845 2018-06-02 23:34:23 The journey wasn't a good one. I mean the end point! 
6846 2018-06-02 23:34:05 THC oil candies. Approximately 10 mg THC / candy. If provides a very gentle base layer that extends itself across an entire afternoon evening.
Or you can eat the whole 100mg for a concert level experience.
6847 2018-06-02 23:33:50 We just referred to him as " The Head" I don't think he got that we mean the bathroom
6848 2018-06-02 23:33:38 I’m wondering if she uses a coconut oil maybe for that flavor but it sure sounds good! I’ll have to look some recipes up myself.
6849 2018-06-02 23:33:32 I got boiling oil splashed on me. I couldn’t take my pants off fast enough and it just kept burning.
6850 2018-06-02 23:33:15 And please don't forget as he "politely" stood by as atrocities were committed against US citizens at #StandingRock.  Under his watch in North Dakota, oil men hired paid mercenaries who committed human rights violations against our native Americans & other water protectors.
6851 2018-06-02 23:33:09 I hate hot oil treatments cause the oil be dripping all down my neck eww so uncomfortable
6852 2018-06-02 23:32:56 いや わかってたさ 鍵垢をヒョローしたらすけべ垢を作りたくなることくらい
6853 2018-06-02 23:32:52 Maybe a little sesame oil?
6854 2018-06-02 23:32:46 Why did the oil monarch do after a socialist revolution hit Switzerland?
6855 2018-06-02 23:32:30 You have not made a convincing case that UK voters would accept EEA FoM, nor a case that membership is suited to the UK economy.
If anything, it's EU-lite, which is fine if you sell fish and oil, but a bit pointless if you're the #1 financial services economy.
6856 2018-06-02 23:32:00 I look up to u bamike Bea.....,more info abt uo oil.
Is it only in naija??? Or ard africa
6857 2018-06-02 23:31:34 The u.s. maybe producing alot of oil.What good does it do the American citizen when the oil companies sell it to overseas buyers?

6860 2018-06-02 23:31:06 One more match until I make top 8! Took down Snake Eyez and Brolylegs, time to take down the king of oil next!
6861 2018-06-02 23:30:59 You all can't tell me after that baby oil video that Finn doesn't know what he's doing to us 
6862 2018-06-02 23:30:36 Sorry, this is wrong. Breaking the Iran deal affected oil prices significantly upwards. On unemployment yes, the US economy was near full employment when he was elected
6863 2018-06-02 23:30:25 The problems in Alberta have to do with the fact Oil tanked and the previous Conservative government put all their eggs in that basket and were banking on oil always being over $100 a barrel
6864 2018-06-02 23:30:24 What is beard oil for and should i have it
6865 2018-06-02 23:30:20 really !  higher trucking costs to deliver in mtn communities , USA increasing prices because of reduced  importing oil , which results in paying  higher prices to US producers-passed on to users , in  transition period between sumr/winter gas !!

luv the way ya just make up stuf
6866 2018-06-02 23:30:18 Actually sounds pretty normal. You like the lighter crisp brews and heartier sips but not the ultraheavy motor oil types. Try an old ale. Old Stock by @NoCoastBrewCo would put probably suit you nicely. It's one of my favorites
6867 2018-06-02 23:30:15 ایندوکلئاز یک آنزیمه که سلول های چندگانه رو توسط جداسازی نوکلوتید ها از انتها جدا میکنه البته تو ایران شدنی نیست سنتز این داروها چون مافیا دارو سازی هست و مردم رو با داروهای غیر استاندارد به کشتن میدن سه بار در هفته باید تزریق بشه در شرایط حاد تا وقتی پیدا کنید میتونید از CBD oil
6868 2018-06-02 23:30:01 I believe liberals who hate oil came up with this idea.
6869 2018-06-02 23:29:46 Man animal behaviourists sure get a broad education these days. Footprint casting, hair comparison, oil recognition. Wow. #metvwonderwoman
6870 2018-06-02 23:29:42 What?!
The Morton County justice system & the judge are both a JOKE!
Just lap dogs of the big oil interests, no justice there!
I watched the live streams...
The Water Protectors rights were violated over and over!
6871 2018-06-02 23:29:23 3 hours waiting for a oil change and check up. I waited patiently, and I got my oil change for free

6876 2018-06-02 23:27:51 It can be done. Cheap egg and oil substitute. 

It's not a never, but I'd just stick with eggs and oil most of the time. I'll just mainline the mayo.

Don't judge me.

6878 2018-06-02 23:27:39 Google and do research Dick. He is not a billionaire. He is a grifter and snake oil salesman. How do I know this, I worked on Wall Street and he was hated by the bankers for not paying his debts.

6885 2018-06-02 23:25:22 Imagine we had guys like this in positions of power. Guys that can actually think. All we have are privileged idiots that sleep all day and wait for oil proceeds so they can buy their 50th house and campaign for elections. The state of the country tells it all.
6886 2018-06-02 23:25:21 We need to find them. Gather yam, kola nut, cows and crude oil and give them in apology.
That's somebody's project topic in the NDA!!! 
6887 2018-06-02 23:25:10 Also got to visit with my friend, James Tennison, who was named a Signature Master, the highest recognition by Oil Painters of America. That's his portrait of Charlie Brown that is in the show.
6888 2018-06-02 23:25:07 Wrong. This is about enviro crazies in Canada and the States that are funded by the groups that Vivian Krause is exposing daily. Dig deeper and you’ll find people like Warren Buffet who has a lot of interest in rail companies and they don’t want oil moving through pipelines.
6889 2018-06-02 23:24:50 It has an oil leak  like super bad

6893 2018-06-02 23:23:28 Alaska is begging China to build our NG pipeline from Prudhoe Bay oil field to Anchorage or the valley. Our Gov is kissin ass and sucking what ever they say and let's see how the trade wars go...lol Trump may be killing a state that voted for him...lmao.

6897 2018-06-02 23:22:29 Nun bubba, you can fuss and argue all you want, but this old group of Americans ain’t about to give up their weapons. We are born with them and we will die with them.
6898 2018-06-02 23:22:18 Nooooooo that’s like 3 weeks... Ok, have u tried Clove oil? It’s natural & works on tooth ache.. London Cabbies know all the tricks. X
6899 2018-06-02 23:22:07 Should of took care of those Damn oil lanterns, candles & woodburning & furnaces stoves years century ago.
6900 2018-06-02 23:21:55 Spot on!!! We are there for oil profits only. Unfortunately our leaders over here put more value into $$ then human life.

6902 2018-06-02 23:21:41 I've heard of people using it when they are out of eggs or veg oil or something. I never knew there are people who do this on purpose. 

I'm always out of mayo. I don't buy it  nasty stuff
6903 2018-06-02 23:20:35 ugh, i'm sorry, canker sores are AWFUL - i had two a little while ago and I was MISERABLE. I found that daubing at them with a Q-tip covered in hydrogen peroxide worked pretty well - and if you're brave, a little tea tree oil (and i do mean a little) directly on the suckers.
6904 2018-06-02 23:20:24 Oh okay! Well no there’s no tomatoes of any kind or onions here. Although they’d be great additions lol it’s cooked in chicken broth with lemon, and olive oil
6905 2018-06-02 23:20:17 If it ain’t ocky oil it don’t touch my body
6906 2018-06-02 23:20:12 Still cant move on with my facial oil
6907 2018-06-02 23:20:10 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
6908 2018-06-02 23:20:09 How could the US allow a shithole country like Cuba, to get a grip on the country with the largest oil reserves in the country and ruin it, have terrorist training camps in there??? @POTUS @marcorubio
6909 2018-06-02 23:20:09 So just to point out the most obvious - as no vehicles are made in Scotland. Vehicles are an 'English export' and bigger than oil....

6917 2018-06-02 23:18:38 Truth to power here! Neither do I. It’s like not even on my list of things to care about! I’d say it’s a ploy of Trumps to keep the press talking about him & his crime family. After all he’s a snake oil, real estate, Reality Show host con man, where any press is better than none!

6934 2018-06-02 23:16:14 The shipping industry will this year scrap the largest number of oil tankers in over half-a-decade, driven by weak earnings, firm prices for scrap steel and the need to prepare fleets for strict new environmental regulations.

6937 2018-06-02 23:16:01 Just the opposite, we want oil to go up, directly related or not gas increases with it. Houston is a  oil and gas city, when it’s up everything is good. Some areas still have Harvey damage but mostly rebuilt.
6938 2018-06-02 23:15:52 Dammit, looks like a BS movie night tonight!! 
6939 2018-06-02 23:15:49 You know that nothing's gonna happen to RuSSia. The West will still beg at Putin's feat for oil and gas deals and "dialogue." Trump, Schröder, Juncker, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Greence, etc. are all in Putin's pocket.
6940 2018-06-02 23:15:45 It boiled over so much we stopped sending oil to Japan and sent over to Europe to help our allies , Japan did not like it and bombed Pearl Harbor

6947 2018-06-02 23:14:35 Additionally, worldwide, renewable energy sector is already employing more people than oil industry. Canada is way behind on this. Investments into propping up a dying fossil fuel industry should be diverted to transitioning workers into those sectors.

6949 2018-06-02 23:14:30 Sources say that Ivanka Trump began drilling for oil in an eloquent puppy, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice. But her emails!

6951 2018-06-02 23:14:00 Not since November but first time I’ve gotten an oil change outside the dealership
6952 2018-06-02 23:13:58 I don’t know how people can do oil pulling for 20 minutes. I managed only 2 minutes 
6953 2018-06-02 23:13:58 I know you mean well but please don't call this stuff oil. It's tar sand bitumen which is diluted with LNG condensate & or other harmful solvents. It may float for a while at first in sea water and spread over several kms before sinking or beaching itself and destroy ecosystems.
6954 2018-06-02 23:13:55 Olive oil, butter, pomegranate molasses and za’atar rubbed all over the bird. 2 cloves of garlic and half a lemon inside. Rest of garlic bulb scattered in tin. Cook ..

6959 2018-06-02 23:13:16 No just short term thinking. we sold our State Oil Company.  In Norway they have Statoil that will exploit fields if the Large Oil Companies don't. That way they can either charge a realistic tax or produce and sell the oil themselves-simple strategy really.
6960 2018-06-02 23:12:42 Sigh.. The US has lost every trade case on softwood. How are those Oil subsidies working out for you.?  Have a nice evening.
6961 2018-06-02 23:12:41 Doesn’t matter! And what your country is done for football? Nothing! Zero! All they do is steal this oil money! Billions of dollars every year! Nigerian team could of have best players and manager! Need to invest in Sport! Shameful to watch!

6970 2018-06-02 23:11:07 Yes but you can't rely on oil is my point.
6971 2018-06-02 23:10:50 there's gotta be enough olive oil for the both of us

6976 2018-06-02 23:10:15 A country with a real media would discuss corn prices and how it effected poor Africans.   But we don't have that.
6977 2018-06-02 23:10:08 The shipping industry will this year scrap the largest number of oil tankers in over half-a-decade, driven by weak earnings, firm prices for scrap steel and the need to prepare fleets for strict new environmental regulations.

6981 2018-06-02 23:09:53 But on a helpful note, try peppermint essential oil. Just inhale it & if it’s not too much for you, put a dab on your nostrils and maybe later on, try some on your temples. DO NOT get it in your eyes 
6982 2018-06-02 23:09:25 What tax cut?  Increases in oil prices just sent our tax savings to Russia and the Middle East.  While the US is borrowing heavily to prop up our economy.  Wonder why?
6983 2018-06-02 23:09:21 Damn Marines use to steal my chicks.. ( I don’t mind sharing as long as go first!!) 
6984 2018-06-02 23:09:15 @GovernorVA thank you for signing the cbd oil legislation, but we have a long way to go. As a non-military PTSD sufferer, medicinal marijuana would help me. Where does Virginia stand?
6985 2018-06-02 23:09:05 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
6986 2018-06-02 23:09:02 when scott pruitt inevitably gets charged and sentenced, the punishment ought to be waterboarding except replace water with crude oil
6987 2018-06-02 23:08:56 charcoal is the new coconut oil
6988 2018-06-02 23:08:46 Ok. We're gonna need an inflatable pool. several gallons of coconut oil, a flatbed truck, a few hundred dollars worth of sex toys, some rope, a bunch of bananas (potassium), a large quantity of your favorite liquor, an enema kit, carmex and a pass to the Grand Canyon camping area
6989 2018-06-02 23:08:44 Bet it smell like coconut oil and love in there.
6990 2018-06-02 23:08:44 True. The left coast is silent and more concerned with the gender or racial controversies of the day plus all the rest and their counterparts are either uninterested or do not smell oil or natural gas and unless you moved those unfortunate people to another continent...Sorry?

7012 2018-06-02 23:05:47 Can either of you offer up an alternative to oil? Do you even realize how many different fuels and products are made with oil? No, you probably have no clue.
7013 2018-06-02 23:05:42 Then how come price is similar? 
Even usd price is similar. So what inefficiencies has Modi removed in the system to produce oil from crude cheaper? That too almost 35% cheaper?

7035 2018-06-02 23:03:07 Or is bread a gateway drug to butter? Anything that causes excessive dopamine can be addictive.

Arguably butter is suboptimal anyway; bread and olive oil and balsamic vinegar is more Mediterranean diet.

7042 2018-06-02 23:02:15 Thanks to @potus, we have millions of barrels of our oil. We are producing our own steel so we don't have to buy cheap sh*t from China. Building factories everywhere to build our own autos, so who who cares if EU thinks DJT is an isolationist leader? We can do all things in God!
7043 2018-06-02 23:02:13 Damn!! That’s where we got that.. Use to have contests in my division on ship.. 
7044 2018-06-02 23:01:59 Also my skin absorbed ALL this oil and im still not as dark as desired 
7045 2018-06-02 23:01:47 We produce more than half of our own oil production and we are net exporters to the EU of oil too.import from Norway, Algeria, Nigeria. We are one of largest exporters of petrol in the oecd!

7048 2018-06-02 23:01:32 Those numbers are a pipe dream :)  
Even if we believe stats from Big Oil lobbyists (I don't) - you can do the math on the billions of oil subsidies + bail out, + the reclamation costs that can range from $100,000, up to millions of dollars of 330,000 wells in Alberta.  #Facts

7050 2018-06-02 23:00:56 OMG!!! Ok cause I’ve been using Tea Tree oil too!
7051 2018-06-02 23:00:39 Your entire tweet is riddled with incorrect information. You apalling snake oil salesman. As a decent person (I assume) you should be ashamed of yourself.
7052 2018-06-02 23:00:38 Simple recipe for summer haricot vert side dish- add a vinaigrette (parsley, garlic, onion, red wine vinegar, olive oil) to cooked cut beanpod? pieces.
7053 2018-06-02 23:00:38 2/? Many people make the mistake of trying to "dry out" oily skin, but you actually need to make sure it's sufficiently moisturized so it will stop thinking "welp, guess we're in the desert, time to oil up!" A good line is Cetaphil or Cerave.
7054 2018-06-02 23:00:37 そんなことしたら、怒りはこんなもんじゃなかっただろうなぁ（笑）だから貴方が前で正解！！
7055 2018-06-02 23:00:34 It actually got hot enough to melt my entire jar of coconut oil
7056 2018-06-02 23:00:27 Way to go Mango Mussolini, forcing energy companies to buy from oil, coal and nuclear in order to bail them out is asinine. It is in no way a security issue. Get ready to pay more for energy America! Being this regressive is like forgetting how to make penicillin.

7058 2018-06-02 23:00:21 1/? If you're not already slathering yourself in sunscreen every time you go out (or even if you sit by a window), then start asap. Don't get soap with sulfates, it will dry out your skin and make your face decide it needs to make up the diff and overcompenstate with excess oil.
7059 2018-06-02 23:00:18 No mention of the bipartisan efforts to deliver #45Q tax credits for 'clean coal' and enhanced oil recovery. How is recently legislated long term support for new coal not relevant here? #CCUS

7066 2018-06-02 22:59:40 Haha. Competitors join forces to put pressure on an opponent? Hardly 'record books' territory here. If this had been oil&coal joining to condemn, say, Obama admin plan to prop up solar, you'd be screeching about oligarchy and monopolies.

7092 2018-06-02 22:54:52 Just give us one of the those oil tycoons from the Middle East. Any will do, but with enough smarts to throw money at important people to run the club.
7093 2018-06-02 22:54:49 CBD oil is great. Get some!
7094 2018-06-02 22:54:49 Maybe? Dunno. Figured I’d leave out the whole instability of the oil
Market point :)
7095 2018-06-02 22:54:48 huh, how in the oil prior frying ? after for taste?

7101 2018-06-02 22:53:55 The joy of having free time is that my dinner is oven baked chicken (seasoned with salt, pepper, and olive oil) and steamed Farmer's Market asparagus. Time to cook is a wonderful thing.
7102 2018-06-02 22:53:54 lactovegetarian because I'm allergic to animal body parts served up as food. (also extra virgin olive oil is off too.) brings on chronic fatigue, migraines and a dire need to spent quality time in the bathroom impersonating ducks :-p

7119 2018-06-02 22:51:59 That's probably it. Given that I don't fry, and only use olive oil in other cookery as needed. And that the smell of chippers even across a road can threaten the contents of my stomach with Surprise Expulsion... :P

7202 2018-06-02 22:40:19 Dry immediately after each use with paper towels. Once you can start to use it for cooking again, take some high-burn-point oil (I use safflower), and use a paper towel to coat the entire interior surface. Then put it in the oven at 425 for 30 minutes

Will need further investigation.

7218 2018-06-02 22:38:42 No, Petronas pays dividends. The royalties come from the output of oil & gas, which have to be paid regardless of whether it’s Petronas or a non-GLC like Shell
7219 2018-06-02 22:38:32 Instead of banging on, did you actually anticipate and try to prevent this? One reason why folk voted as they did; is because it doesn’t matter how absurd the story is, as long as it fits your narrative of socio-economic armageddon, you’ll peddle it.

7228 2018-06-02 22:36:02 I keep hearing that but no one seems to give much of a reason.

Other than "cavemen didn't eat them" but I'm pretty sure they ate more beans in the paleolithic than they did coconut oil.
7229 2018-06-02 22:35:40 okay so you could bake it with olive oil and parmesan and if you use enough spices it’ll taste alright or just put it in pasta sauce or as a homemade pizza topping but honestly. it’s pretty disgusting
7230 2018-06-02 22:35:39 i have an actual CBD pen from a line called organabus, it comes with a charger and oil already in it, the lady said i probably could refill it with a syringe once its out but i only just got it not too long ago, and i have mango flavored 250 mg cbd oil you put under your tongue
7231 2018-06-02 22:35:17 Ok I’ll need some High quality gun oil before i can do this mission
7232 2018-06-02 22:34:42 There is so much oil and silicone keeping all that hair down as best as possible hahahahahaha
7233 2018-06-02 22:34:01 So busy I be on the historical factor of #Jeffrey and ilk I be in   high #dungeon you go mess with my #oil! And pay so much for #fuel!
7234 2018-06-02 22:33:54 My neurologist and I discussed her methods years ago and she said it was snake oil and she was right!
7235 2018-06-02 22:33:44 È arrivato il genio, io parlo di Oil e lui mi parla di benzina. Ti meriti proprio il governo che hai scelto.
7236 2018-06-02 22:33:43 I'm not against oil being used for products. I'm against oil being burned. With that said, take away Exxon gasoline profits and the company will be worth only a fraction of what it is today
7237 2018-06-02 22:33:36 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
7238 2018-06-02 22:33:28 You do understand that Alida's money is from John D. Rockefeller, the original oil robber baron, right?
7239 2018-06-02 22:33:20 There is no massive crude oil deposits
7240 2018-06-02 22:33:17 In summary @MBuhari is the reason we had a recessed economy and not oil price crash neither is it @GEJonathan actions or inactions.. He is the one getting it back albeit slowly.. So he deserves no accolade yet.
7241 2018-06-02 22:33:14 U really R uninformed! Canada did OK bc Cdn Banking system & large Liberal surplus of $13.8B Harper inherited. But Harper unable to have a single Surplus of his own (last one was FAKE) put all economy reliant on Oil & left Infrastructure crumbling #cdnpoli

7244 2018-06-02 22:32:52 Synthenol oil injections.
7245 2018-06-02 22:32:50 sometimes eucalyptus oil smells great but other times it just smells like straight cat piss
7246 2018-06-02 22:32:48 Estee lauder gila sih. Terus Dior undercover (ini oil free). Ini semua full cov. Kalo yang medium to full Chanel Les beiges bagus bgt.
7247 2018-06-02 22:32:12 Wash them up once a week and coat them in oil, leather will stay moist and flexible longer
7248 2018-06-02 22:32:07 One can't judge a person's culpability, but you can and should judge a person's sin as sin. Do you judge what is good and bad for one's physical body (drinking water instead of oil)? If so you can see why we Christains apply that same principle for the soul.
7249 2018-06-02 22:32:00 @SenateFloor save coal . energy comp. is ready to fund in full a plant in Salyersville ky. extracts oil from coal no pollution air ,water. 41% more oil reserves UNITED STATES 500 000 new jobs highest quality oil. more oil in ky. than IRAN & we can export this oil. gas prices down

Now have to clean kitchen or get on Twitter... here I am!
7255 2018-06-02 22:31:13 Let’s just say no to nature path foods, unless they can prove they don’t use any oil products.
7256 2018-06-02 22:31:11 Lavender Essential oil. Just used it for same thing on my mom.
7257 2018-06-02 22:31:08 You are peddling fake news here. It was an Economic War Game. We import 45% of our food - that is true, however not all of it comes from EU. As for petrol, Norway and Qatar provide our oil and gas (besides our own fields.)
7258 2018-06-02 22:31:08 The cost of not having the oil, gas and coal industries would be poverty and misery for everyone on earth.
7259 2018-06-02 22:31:05 @KHayhoe: RT @EricLiptonNYT: This has got to be one for the record books. Oil industry joins with solar and wind industry to condemn Trum...
7260 2018-06-02 22:31:01 This one cover-up gave us Iran Embassy takeover, the Iraq War, the
theft of over three trillion dollars in Iraqi oil and now this corrupted 2016
election.  It was the father of them all.
7261 2018-06-02 22:30:02 I just simply hate my today salad with Vignette salt and oil, Steak with whine-thyme sauce and potato stuff + Cake...good food~
7262 2018-06-02 22:29:58 only in an African household would I come back home to find my sweet jar has been replaced with oil 
7263 2018-06-02 22:29:35 A staggering level of denial and self delusion - “This snake oil really hits the spot”
7264 2018-06-02 22:29:24 I don’t usually use concealer and rn I’m not out in the sun so I’m super pale. The missing a tiny tiny dot with coconut oil helps a little. The spoons work. The classic prep-h beauty today trick will work for an hour but then the puff comes back
7265 2018-06-02 22:29:13 Celebrate the sun with new Machine Gun joints! Oil & keif infused, with flavors like Pineapple, Cherry, Grape & more! 20% off all day! YAY!
7266 2018-06-02 22:29:02 Methane, hydrogen and oxygen will be the oil and natural gas of the Solar System!
Once the ball of propellant manufacturing outside Earth's deep gravity well starts rolling, it'll be unstoppable! Everything else will be easy by comparison.
We KNOW what to do once we get there...
7267 2018-06-02 22:28:49 The oil wars have already been raged or raging. The next big war will be over WATER, and to a lesser degree, food.
7268 2018-06-02 22:28:49 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
7269 2018-06-02 22:28:29 So if @MBuhari failure is tied to oil price crash, has oil price increased significantly now that we experience economic growth? No! So why? By relaxing his command & control on the economy, allowing ease of doing business, this has led to increased output for us..
7270 2018-06-02 22:27:35 Max was wrong about Peak Oil, he was wrong about gold.  This is just another wrong feather in his cap
7271 2018-06-02 22:26:59 the largest percentage of the pump price for gas is TAXES !  the "GREEDY" oil companies are making just pennies per gallon.
7272 2018-06-02 22:26:58 You forgot to slosh the olive oil about ;)
7273 2018-06-02 22:26:55 He took my car to get an oil change, washed it, & gassed it up for me. Allll while I’m in San Diego!
7274 2018-06-02 22:26:53 Candles & oil lamps...
7275 2018-06-02 22:26:45 Perbincangan sama seorang seller shopee pagi ini. Ceritanya abis beli cleansing oil.

Me: "hah? Gimana?" 
S: "aku ngirim barangnya dari kota mana?" 

YA SUGAN MANEH. 

Pibataleun puasa wae.
7276 2018-06-02 22:26:36 ‘Don’t forget your toothbrush! Check the oil in your car!’ Like, dude, I’ve been going to sleepovers since I was 6, it’s not that complicated.
And they’re like ‘write your schedule down’ like, my boys can only be in one place at a time, I’m not likely to miss them 
7277 2018-06-02 22:25:49 CBD oil is legal in Georgia. It doesn’t work for everyone. However if cbd doesn’t help with seizures marijuana probably won’t either. I hope this kid was placed with family and not foster care. I suggest trying CBD oil you can even smoke it.
7278 2018-06-02 22:25:47 Spice up your life! Fig & HONEY, cracked pepper & olive oil, roasted garlic, FIRE roasted TOmaTO!
7279 2018-06-02 22:25:45 Same here man! These honeys don’t know about this oil field money 
7280 2018-06-02 22:25:43 Who mentioned oil? Scotland is more than a string fiddle. Unlike our neighbours.
7281 2018-06-02 22:25:26 Ripped off?
You got wares and services & the world got worthless hyperinflated FED fiat-dollar which is merely held alive by its dollar-for-oil monopoly and the OPEC cartel.

US economy has been gutted and outsourced for decades, that's where your trade deficit comes from noob.
7282 2018-06-02 22:25:21 Take the fillet, salt and pepper it well, oil and pre-heat your pan on medium or medium high, and then set the fillet in it skin side down first, and DON'T TOUCH IT. For like a solid 4-5 minutes, just let it sit. That's the trick to browning anything, is DON'T TOUCH
7283 2018-06-02 22:25:20 I am building a boston whaler to hunt whales for whale oil. I hear they are lifting sanctions.
7284 2018-06-02 22:25:03 Thanks for the information, and tip, I now know all diseases in motor oil are super rare.
7285 2018-06-02 22:25:02 Then in goes the cooking oil and the meat, making the pan sizzle. Sebastian chucks the vegetables in soon after and stirs everything with two huge spoons. 
"Do you want the noodles on the side or in with the rest?"
7286 2018-06-02 22:25:02 @EricLiptonNYT Band is back together! Early days oil industry owned much of PV industry. Awash in petro dollars, they bought up the supply chain to power remote equipment/rigs. Exxon, Mobil, ARCO, BP, etc. (Also Total is majority owner of Sunpower) But Fascinating times indeed!
7287 2018-06-02 22:24:34 Did Moore give Walters an oil check at the end of that #IREUSA match? Is that what set Walters off? 
7288 2018-06-02 22:23:57 My favorite quick & easy keto dish!
Rotisserie chicken shredded, fresh string beans, diced onions, and chopped grape tomatoes. Season with salt, pepper and garlic. Cooked in olive oil and done in 10 minutes!!
7289 2018-06-02 22:23:55 I’ve accidentally gotten it in my eyes, nose and mouth. You should take care to keep it out of cuts and cracks in your skin.  The vapors emitted by hot motor oil are hazardous.
7290 2018-06-02 22:23:53 WM has had 92% of scottish oil for 50 years and still managed to near bankrupt the country.
No wonder scots want out
7291 2018-06-02 22:23:46 I don’t mind paying a little extra so that we can put sanctions on Iran . And last I checked the president doesn’t dictate the price of oil
7292 2018-06-02 22:23:42 Nah, Typhoid Mary.
7293 2018-06-02 22:23:25 Supply and demand teach me what I’m missing. I worked in the oil fields and overseas.  I will be respectful whatever makes our life’s better.
7294 2018-06-02 22:23:23 Palm oil on your white tee. damn you should of never ate that jollof rice before putting on your white T
7295 2018-06-02 22:23:18 You people that put plenty oil inside food
7296 2018-06-02 22:23:16 Burning the midnight oil too?
7297 2018-06-02 22:23:14 Fuel price rise was BJPs major election issue in 2014. They shudnt hv let dis happen, specially near 2019. And they have been bragging about lower fuel prince since they have won, it was coz of cheap crude oil though. Ab thorri to lagegi hi.
7298 2018-06-02 22:22:36 When the price of oil fell to $50 a barrel the pound was at its strongest. So why was that if the pound is so dependent on oil exports?
7299 2018-06-02 22:22:16 Let your parents change your oil or harp on you about saving money, they won’t be around forever 
7300 2018-06-02 22:22:03 I want to try hemp oil, I hate pharmaceuticals.  I take 30+ pills a day 
7301 2018-06-02 22:21:54 Hahah indeed. The guy used some sort of oil that smells like old wood. Feel dignified 
7302 2018-06-02 22:21:54 Fuck Feed Me Oil 2
7303 2018-06-02 22:21:34 This is horrible. Maybe they should have gone to a State where it is legal for med reasons? Possibly get the oil, so he wouldn't have to smoke it? The oil doesn't have THC in it so it should be legal. I hope the parents get alot of support in their cause.
7304 2018-06-02 22:21:25 Q4 of #NHRApsm will reconvene after TOP FUEL due to an oil down during the @PapaJohns Charity Challenge. #Route66Nats
7305 2018-06-02 22:21:21 @UPenn_MedEthics  saw you on Washington Journal. What about the situation in the  movie Dallas Buyers Club where those dying had to fight. Also Lorenzo's Oil. Why don't doctors fight the pharmaceutical companies to make these type of medications available.
7306 2018-06-02 22:21:04 Alberta is in trouble because previous administrations put everything into the gold rush of the tar sands. Then the bottom fell out of that market. There is no future in an oil economy. Everyone needs to wise up, NDP in Alberta included.
7307 2018-06-02 22:20:46 Everything did you see how much we losing if we made all that here we wouldn’t need them I think that’s what’s going on and gas prices going mean the oil field jobs are doing better and more jobs created everyone benefits from that the problem is no one giving anyone a chance.

Yemen is a target either due to its offshore oil deposits (recently re-discovered) or its startegic location

7313 2018-06-02 22:19:48 Seriously,  does the peppermint oil really help migraines?
7314 2018-06-02 22:19:26 Yes! I was distracted by this also, but kept thinking of an Australian chef who (over) uses the acronym ‘EVOO’; extra virgin olive oil. But, back to OOO ...
7315 2018-06-02 22:19:11 Baba yache dnt rush me plz,he never got ready

“Hello. How are you?” today.
7319 2018-06-02 22:18:39 Apologies #Australia - please don’t waste your money on listening to the drivel that spouts from this shit stirring snake oil salesman. He’s not worth it.
7320 2018-06-02 22:18:30 I marinated a filet with it and some of Erin Dickens' Provence seasoning, some fresh asparagus flash-seared in olive oil and garlic, and then because there was waaaay too much wine left to just cork and put back in the fridge, I nibbled on a couple of different cheeses....
7321 2018-06-02 22:18:13 I really have to watch this movie again.
7322 2018-06-02 22:17:39 Sooo tell me why i always thought my dad would do the oil in my car till i fucked up the car Bc i didn’t put oil in it.
7323 2018-06-02 22:16:49 I will take that as a yes thanks to you, I know all diseases are super rare in motor oil.
7324 2018-06-02 22:16:47 currently on dnd: our rogue is trying to pull a vial from the big bads hand with a bottle of slippery oil and it's the dumbest thing we've ever done
7325 2018-06-02 22:16:38 What’s your take on crude oil?
7326 2018-06-02 22:16:32 See oil it will kill sombori with cough

7328 2018-06-02 22:16:13 Having a job is overrated, says Nancy
7329 2018-06-02 22:16:05 It takes repeated exposure over years. Used motor oil contains metals like chromium and lead, plus many harmful volatile chemicals.
7330 2018-06-02 22:15:39 I’ve used AON Mother Natural and Essential CBD Oil and both are great but going to try this because of cost.
7331 2018-06-02 22:15:25 I mean it. 
I deal with rheaumatoid arthritis, asthma, & insomnia. It is no fun at 2 a.m. in the morning. 
I consider people who cope with chronic pain, & rise above it, to be special.  If I had not found relief with Hemp Oil & Nano Curcumin, I would get even less sleep.
7332 2018-06-02 22:15:19 They have sold themselves to their western masters. Too busy infighting over oil as well. #shame.
7333 2018-06-02 22:15:13 I need an oil change

Doesn't matter she, like Ivanka was and really is one of them. She's not conservative, think was raised by commies
7336 2018-06-02 22:14:18 I got coconut oil on my phone camera a week ago and i havnt made any effort to get it off so everyone can just deal with slightly blurry pictures in the meantime
7337 2018-06-02 22:14:02 Additionally, if you understand economics, u do know that a prov govt have no control ovr world oil market pricing. In itself it is laughable that u r trying to say that ndp had and or has cntrl over oil market pricing. Come on, economics 101. U r smarter then that!
7338 2018-06-02 22:13:57 Oil change at Walmart , but I'm trying to keep up with the timeline to get updates on the game

7348 2018-06-02 22:12:54 They must enjoy subsidizing farmers, including corporate growers.  Ethanol doesn't use shit corn, it demands the BEST and leaves the junk to be used for food.
7349 2018-06-02 22:12:52 Do you have some olive oil you can warm up and put in your ear?

7356 2018-06-02 22:11:46 wbrettwilson has proably created more meaningful employment than the liberal government in the last 3 years. the rich are not the problem. I work hard in the oil sands pay my taxes ( a good part of which subsidize the have not provinces who don't want our oil).

7361 2018-06-02 22:11:20 @KeepCanWorking ayyyye die in a river of oil
7362 2018-06-02 22:11:18 As for the price of gas increasing, you forgot that American oil barons profit when the price of oil goes up. By keeping Iranian oil off of the market, Trump also helped American oil barons. Quit blaming just the Saudis when U.S. also kisses big oil ass!
7363 2018-06-02 22:11:10 Re read my tweats, i never said it had nothing to do with it. But it certainly was not the reason for such a speedy deep recession recovery! Of course it helps now, but please, oil has just started to gain momentum, so don't make it sound like rcvry is all oil based!
7364 2018-06-02 22:10:57 Will soon listen to this piece...& this is at the heart of why distributing (selling) oil from the tar sands is haunting. As some shout that we "must" take $ from this "resource", others of us cringe at the thought that it just perpetuates & accentuates global fossil fuel damage
7365 2018-06-02 22:10:57 The 1924 Encyclopedia Britannica article on oil predicted it would run out by the early 1940's.
7366 2018-06-02 22:10:49 Your vested interest as an oil banker is not the same as my interest as a citizen and taxpayer. Attempting to conflate them is a good example of how irresponsible you are on this. Sad to watch. You seemly can't absorb the many facts that contradict your financial interest.
7367 2018-06-02 22:10:48 To me it looked less like a concerted slowdown than a number of elements that were waxing and waning out of sync momentarily coinciding on the downside, including the trough of the oil crash and and a strong-dollar-induced manufacturing slump.

7370 2018-06-02 22:10:05 no idea. I'm not one for calling anything of that nature a 'subsidy' but guess it depends on how you allocate WoS oil revenues
7371 2018-06-02 22:10:03 Smoking point for olive oil is 375f, all I can say is it’s a good thing the olive is still in the olive! Texas is smoking hot today!!

7378 2018-06-02 22:09:41 Both the sinkholes in Texas and Israel are making some places unstable. Israelis removed water holding land intact. Dead Sea region is not considered dangerous due to sinkholes. Parts of Texas are becoming like Swiss cheese due to oil removal until every last drop was gone.

7381 2018-06-02 22:09:25 should have written "when oil fell back in 2014" -- that's when the measured tourism outflow jumped (and by more than can be explained by the rise in actual tourists)

7393 2018-06-02 22:07:47 In other words, you like the idea of earthquakes and sinkholes by removing oil and natural gas. Take a good hard look at USGS earthquake zone maps. Earthquakes in Oklahoma and some states are the result of fracking, Texas has unpredictable sinkholes due to oil removal.

7412 2018-06-02 22:03:51 can it be both a tactic - the method used to measure the tourism deficit was changed to keep the surplus from soaring when oil fell - and the reflection of a fragile rebalancing driven by the 2016 fiscal loosening?

7433 2018-06-02 22:01:15 I would say that you have nothing to back that up. Fact is UCP + the instry said they could not afford increases, it would kill the fragile economy.  The increases were brought in, economy+growth in conjunction with. while oil was still too low to get us out of recession. Magic
7434 2018-06-02 22:01:13 PS, in Colorado, it is often an individual choice. Many individuals who use CBD oil are using it via self-prescription not from a provider prescription. And there is research being done in CO.

7436 2018-06-02 22:00:57 Rumor is Canada has been funneling Chinese aluminum and steel into U.S. under guise of “made in Canada.” Some industries are critical to U.S. economy and national security. China can’t become monopoly source. Think oil independence.

7439 2018-06-02 22:00:21 Why we use olive oil in our soaps: Olive oil contains oleic acid and polyphenols which improve skin tone and texture. It can also help replenish the oils that we lose in our skin as we get older, resulting in a younger, smoother appearance. #eekohgoods

7457 2018-06-02 21:58:09 We can shut down steel, aluminum, water, electricity, oil, gas, lumber, dairy and much more. Then you all will be paying other countries that love Canada a higher price to import these commodities.
7458 2018-06-02 21:58:03 Sounds like an admission that Scots aren't really a crowd of benefit junkies supported by "the marvellously tolerant English" to quote M. Thatcher as she squandered oil revenue on an overheated South East English economy.

7469 2018-06-02 21:55:45 I think Iran exists in a unique scenario in which her ability to project power in the region via subversive political strategy directly translates to her ability to negotiate at the international table through the price of oil. It's a very high stakes game.

7474 2018-06-02 21:54:36 Really? Your US Gulf Coast refineries need 2.7 million b/d of heavy crude oil and with Mexico and Venezuela in decline, they're buying it from Canada. So, still wanna fuck with us? We can figure out how to get crude oil to China, trust me.
7475 2018-06-02 21:54:31 This way The home country doesn't have any responsibilities toward their citizens and reaps the rewards.

7500 2018-06-02 21:50:25 Please next time use your common sense even though its not common. We sold oil for the number of months PMB did not appoint ministers. Nobody is asking for accountability during this periods. Please next time ask for the handover note not propaganda note for details
7501 2018-06-02 21:50:22 I want a chef coat. I’m sick of my good shirts being ruined because of oil stainsssss 
7502 2018-06-02 21:50:20 oh yg tu i tak suka sbb dia ada mineral oil
7503 2018-06-02 21:50:19 Who are you trying to convince?   If you think you can presuade us, think again. We know about the deregulations on the envionment, big oil & big banks, the tax break for the rich.  Did DJT drain the swamp? If he did, he replaced it with a cesspool. Won't vote for you.  Resign!
7504 2018-06-02 21:50:14 Just looked in the mirror at myself and I am literally an oil slick  brill
7505 2018-06-02 21:50:04 How does oil boom impact on our naira value when we export oil only to import it back refined and more expensive? See let's leave sentiments aside.. @MBuhari was elected to do better than @GEJonathan but he is currently done worst than even Abacha or himself in 1983.. Simple!
7506 2018-06-02 21:49:24 i don’t really like them, i like eel sauce and that’s a huge thing for me and it tastes like peanut oil

7509 2018-06-02 21:49:01 Today at work I rescued a little mouse that was stuck to a sticky trap. I took him outside and rubbed cooking oil on his body to free him and after a minute  he skittered away

7511 2018-06-02 21:48:48 I rubbed some of the calming essential oil nikki got me for my birthday on my sore muscles and oooo baby that shit does wonders

7513 2018-06-02 21:48:34 I as an individual can as well set my ranking scale go on Wikipedia and rank your famous A.B.U. Number 11100. Even your so called NUC ranking is flaw. Come to AUN and you see the difference!!
7514 2018-06-02 21:48:22 I do 1 tbsp light olive oil rubbed into filets

Paprika, ground cumin, salt, onion powder, black pepper...1 tsp each, 1/2 tsp chili powder, mix spices in bowl first. Then sprinkle onto filets and rub in. Put salmon back into the fridge for an hr or two. Then bake. 
7515 2018-06-02 21:47:53 Yup coffee my morning weakness....but now I use no creamers put 2 teaspoons coconut oil and a teaspoon of organic honey....not bad...and coffee is brewed with distilled water.
7516 2018-06-02 21:47:51 Note that some industries such as oil actually created jobs in spite of the Obama admin not because of it. The difference between gov jobs and private sector jobs is in that private sector jobs create revenue while gov needs private sector revenue to exist. It creates nothing.
7517 2018-06-02 21:47:26 How so?  The New tariffs trump wants to impose will affect our ability to manufacture and slow growth.  Sell your snake oil some where else @GOP
7518 2018-06-02 21:47:16 lol I guess baka shiga rana ba yau
7519 2018-06-02 21:47:00 I need a oil change and every shop is stupid busy :(
7520 2018-06-02 21:46:42 Korean war ending & trump is not the reason
Us being polluted by trump & pruit &massive oil spills from pipeline.s
Repealing environmental regulations just as bad as environmental criminals on the show Night Rider.
Not giving a damn about democracy probably believes it's dead ew
7521 2018-06-02 21:46:41 i been calling the dealer for a week to schedule an oil change & NO ONE has answered i even left a voicemail so i text my friend that works there & he got me in the same day

7528 2018-06-02 21:45:49 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!

7536 2018-06-02 21:44:48 Quit using oil and you'll be back in the dark ages LOL.
7537 2018-06-02 21:44:26 World is going electric on auto-mobile,unfortunately US never projected ahead that we would not be needing Oil that long;as they spent so much in buying, chanelling oil pipe lines to store for the future use.
Trump don't believe in climate change,what a mistake to happen to US
7538 2018-06-02 21:44:22 He had this leaked for his deplorables! And this TV Reality Show he’s putting on with NK is for his clueless base, who wouldn’t know a real deal from a Con if you pointed it out to them! Don’t get riled up over his Con! He’s a snake oil real estate reality show con man!

7542 2018-06-02 21:43:55 Oil market rules becoming more like housing markets with location location location being key factor along with type/quality of product. In same way you cannot compare NY apartments with Florida apts we need more indicators than simply Brent and WTI when $19 dif exist in US alone
7543 2018-06-02 21:43:45 Estaba viendo las historias de fuel oil y me dieron ganas de ir, hasta que vi "hambiente " y se me paso
7544 2018-06-02 21:43:40 Got laid off because Obama was ruining the oil & gas industry. Trump comes in, and I get my job back. Funny how that works.
7545 2018-06-02 21:43:39 How true is this? Heard his father is a billionaire into oil and gas
7546 2018-06-02 21:43:26 My grandmas view on CBD oil: "what good is it if it has no side effects?!"
7547 2018-06-02 21:43:15 You have to list palm oil under the Food Information Regulations 2014, and to suggest you do it to offer choice is wrong.

7549 2018-06-02 21:42:52 Playoff numbers are mostly luck, like a guy having a hot streak in the regular season. And unleashing anger usually doesn't help the team win, especially with a guy like Lucic, who's generally better than most teams' enforcers, so the Oil are at a disadvantage post-fight.
7550 2018-06-02 21:42:47 I just checked Aba is in Abia state with a budget of 141bn naira for 2018 and is among the oil states. Why haven’t the government of the state change the system or situation of the state?
7551 2018-06-02 21:42:41 ran my car out of oil, then almost ran in out of gas on the interstate. i like to say it’s because i live on the edge....
7552 2018-06-02 21:42:38 Dis you know that the number 1 exporter of oil to the US is Canada?  Did you also know that the number one occupation in red states is truck driver. Good luck with that!

7557 2018-06-02 21:42:08 Mayo is an emulsion made mostly oil, with a couple egg yolks, and a little vinegar or lemon juice.  Oil & egg yolks make a cake moist, and the acid helps the  baking powder react to make the cake fluffy.  (I was Betty Crocker Homemaker of the Future for my high school )
7558 2018-06-02 21:42:08 i was like 7 thousand miles over getting my oil changed & then i got it changed & now my car is saying i need an oil change this is some bullshit
7559 2018-06-02 21:42:06 Does insurance cover the oil?
7560 2018-06-02 21:41:46 Back when I used to do a lot of chainsaw stuff, I would use my used motor oil as bar oil.  Worked great, and no cost!

7569 2018-06-02 21:40:50 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
7570 2018-06-02 21:40:50 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7571 2018-06-02 21:40:45 I would always ask josh if I can be a stay at home mom, and he’d tell me no.. only if he went back to the oil field.
7572 2018-06-02 21:40:37 This guy just got a different topics abstract,edited it to flow with his work,its very poor from the start and contradictory.

7577 2018-06-02 21:39:49 SOME PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY NAIVE, IT IS JUST PATHETIC THAT PEOPLE STILL LISTEN TO THAT FAILED SNAKE OIL SALESMAN.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE SINCE PEOPLE LIVED THROUGH 8 LONG YEARS OF OBAMA MALAISE.
7578 2018-06-02 21:39:48 But Oil Execs aren’t Christian. They’re Capitalists.
7579 2018-06-02 21:39:37 Peppermint oil. Make a line across the area front and back. Worked wonders for me on my kitchen counters. And so far, they haven’t returned.

7592 2018-06-02 21:37:38 I think that as a Canadian,  rather than putting Import Tariffs on US goods,  that we apply an Export Tariff on Canadian expertise such as Hydro Power, Oil, Water and products that they have to buy.
7593 2018-06-02 21:37:35 Make a pizza! Use a base of sun-dried tomato oil and manchego, add prosciutto and salami and bake. Top with yogurt sauce.
7594 2018-06-02 21:36:57 If any of my fellow live resin smokers are ever frustrated with how much oil is left in a container when you’re done, just cut a short section of a straw, use that to scrape out the remainders and thank me later 
7595 2018-06-02 21:36:43 I mean it wasn't a tube of LUBE, it was olive oil in a jar bc i don't have the real stuff, but

Still
7596 2018-06-02 21:36:43 There is no such thing as “safe nuclear power “.  So, we own up to the fact we’re too dependent on fossil fuels. Fracking helps. Continue to explore renewables and make emissions from fossil fuels safer. BTW, oil prices are currently artificially inflated by OPEC.
7597 2018-06-02 21:36:31 God so I didnt drink water today
7598 2018-06-02 21:36:28 I agree for the most part. Independents have abandoned him. So have republican women. He is running out of snake oil. And after this unadvised trade war it’s going to be horrible for him. He’s directly hurting a key voting group for him. And cost all of us hundreds of dollars
7599 2018-06-02 21:36:26 So does oil and gas to the tune of 3.4 billion in subsidies a year so spare us all your rhetoric!

7622 2018-06-02 21:32:17 Sour cream is not mayo. Mayo is just oily. Y'all might as well just put extra oil in your damn cake and leave off the vinegar and flavourings.
7623 2018-06-02 21:31:57 Mayonaise is eggs and oil . Eggs and oils are integral to all cakes . There's a super popular Italian restaurant in Chicago that has always put mayo in its chocolate cake .
7624 2018-06-02 21:31:38 Hey Gunnsie Wunnsie... Dude(tte)! 
You need to add a warning when you post a selfie like that. We need to send in a HazMat team to clean up your mess!
7625 2018-06-02 21:31:32 I like to wake up and do some intermittent fasting. Then my first meal consists of 8 oz grass-fed grass-finished beef, 1 cup sweet potato 2 eggs and one tbl of coconut oil and a bunch of greens thrown into my Vitamix. I like my biggest meal to be at breakfast
7626 2018-06-02 21:31:32 higher insurance premiums, higher gas prices, coal runoff in the water, dismantling of national parks to drill for gas and oil, ruining our coast to drill for gas and oil, raising the cost of imported raw materials for building you know, everything. Yeah bang up job.
7627 2018-06-02 21:31:31 The spa started selling this $32 body oil that 100% smells like boiled peanuts.

7629 2018-06-02 21:31:28 You #forget oil crashed 2014? BTW global demand for oil continues to increase. Time to get @jjhorgan out of the way so we can export at full capacity & clean up this mess!!!  Interesting no one #bitched when #Alberta paid billions $$ in #equalization payments to other provinces.
7630 2018-06-02 21:31:12 My 5 yr old just told me he has a zombieache and I don't know how to fix it. Hmm must be vaccine damage, that's what the mom groups on Facebook would say.
*rubs coconut oil all over my kid*
*throws vitamin c at his face*
There. Should be fine, go play.
7631 2018-06-02 21:31:02 This has nothing to do with socialism or capitalism. Both systems encourage entrepreneurs. It’s state control in crucial areas that matter. Imagine railways were given to Ambani. They sell India’s oil at international prices to india. That’s capitalism

7633 2018-06-02 21:30:57 More reason they wouldn’t survive.
I guess every month they buy new speakers and generator, and the normal Sunday offering is for buying fuel and oil?
7634 2018-06-02 21:30:44 That’s the way it should be. They keep pouring oil on the flames of sectarianism by doing this stuff.
7635 2018-06-02 21:30:21 Too be honest I listen for good verses no matter what it talks about, whether it’s about the drugs his mom sold him or how black people should be paying the same price for an oil change

7646 2018-06-02 21:28:53 くにいさんも音けっとに参加されるのか
7647 2018-06-02 21:28:49 My mechanic just said to me, “You can take this anyway you want, but in this heat, I am the hottest one out of all of these guys.”

....mmkay let’s just stick to changing my oil honey
7648 2018-06-02 21:28:48 Also, let's ban some guns and nationalize the oil industry!
7649 2018-06-02 21:28:43 More rigged than an oil rig
7650 2018-06-02 21:28:16 Finally got my windows tinted, car washed, and oil changed 
7651 2018-06-02 21:27:34 Right, and a tax on oil production is a tax on oil producers, not people.
7652 2018-06-02 21:27:29 I'd do a larger one for your family size (leaving room in the basket for air flow is key). But omg if you want the kids to eat more veggies, a quick spray of oil plus a dusting of corn starch or rice flour etc makes them so tasty/crispy. Also easy chicken/fish nuggets.
7653 2018-06-02 21:27:17 @VinnieTortorich stupid question maybe. Adam Carolla always talks about taking a shot of MCT oil in the morning. Would Olive oil have the same effect? Or is MCT oil better?
7654 2018-06-02 21:27:15 I saw a special where a woman had oil made for her son with seizures, he went from an average of 3 seizures per day to less than 1 a month on average.
7655 2018-06-02 21:27:01 Ran out of words? 
What about the facts?
Why aren't you or the @GOP talking about the #GOPTaxScam anymore?
Because like Buffett who made billions from this, Americans made maybe a extra few hundred or a thousand? OR because gas, oil and sanctioned items caused prices to rise?
7656 2018-06-02 21:26:59 Best thing I did for myself!! If you have aching joints, do not hesitate to treat them with CBD oil!!
7657 2018-06-02 21:26:55 Daddy pays son $112k/yr to run oil business..
7658 2018-06-02 21:26:36 NP on @WNRRGospel  "Pour Your Oil" @thejoshuarogers on @ThoseBaxters Radio Show follow us on all social media
7659 2018-06-02 21:26:31 He tried the CBD oil from what I understand and it did not stop them. His seizures only responded to THC in the whole plant. 71 days seizure free until they took him from his parents.
7660 2018-06-02 21:26:27 Think bikinis not banks
7661 2018-06-02 21:26:26 Good for oil/balsamic mixing and for dipping sauces.  But these jokers who hold onto 5/6 for making a desert in are living in a dream world.
7662 2018-06-02 21:26:25 i didnt know oil repairs take this long:/ dafaq
7663 2018-06-02 21:25:50 Again with the selfies, Gunnsie Wunnsie? 

You really should stop. Because #Caring... (Not!)
7664 2018-06-02 21:25:45 Yes it can be a goal fr every child,but that doesn't make it the best in Africa,congratulations as u graduate.
7665 2018-06-02 21:25:38 @tacobell it would be nice if you found a way to no fry the cinnamon bites in the same oil as the spicy naked chicken!
7666 2018-06-02 21:25:36 We could just shut off the taps of oil, turn off the water and electricity going into northern New York, and refuse your vessels to export coal out of Vancouver. We have TPP and will be just fine.
7667 2018-06-02 21:25:29 I can see you doing that... I love teaching kids. Especially things that that can use as adults... Changing a tire, checking oil, fixing a leaking tap...
7668 2018-06-02 21:25:26 He washed her windshield, checked  her oil and the tire pressure.
7669 2018-06-02 21:25:22 yeah wow this unintentionally became a really good resource lol! I feel a lot better thanks to yalls advice~ (I also took a large quantity of CBD oil so that helped too haha)
7670 2018-06-02 21:25:21 Trade deals are formed by bureaucrats who can not be trusted.They have destroyed manufacturing
and made America into a banana republic. We export minerals, oil and gas, farm goods.We import iron,  aluminium, machinery and
manufactured goods.
Export Bananas
7671 2018-06-02 21:25:18 The father is a successful oil and gas tycoon. Never a deadbeat.
7672 2018-06-02 21:25:05 I gotta love/hate relationship with bmw, the whole not having a dipstick thing is fuckin weird 2 me! Car holds together pretty well though just needa change the valve cover cause shitty slight oil leak rip
7673 2018-06-02 21:24:58 When oil gets together with solar and wind to complain about trump and coal, there's a big problem...
7674 2018-06-02 21:24:48 Wait. Dip him in hot oil and cover him in glaze!
7675 2018-06-02 21:24:40 The problem with starting without proper infrastructure means that Turkana may in the end remain as it is. Without infrastructure. The government should have asked the oil companies to make tarmac roads.
7676 2018-06-02 21:24:36 The richest black woman in the world isn't Oprah, it's a Nigerian Philanthropist/Oil Tycoon named Folorunsho Alakija.
7677 2018-06-02 21:24:34 U applying the OIL at the wrong place old man
U shudve applied it where it is bleeding now 
7678 2018-06-02 21:24:13 Here r some tips to it; Put lotion or powder (rub it in) before waxing
Or besides waxing you can get
Threading? Idk if this technique is used there or not but its less painful.
Also to avoid rash or redness put oil (coconut oil or olive oil) on your skin after waxing or threading
7679 2018-06-02 21:24:02 Good news sa mga motorista, oil price rollback, aarangkada na ngayong araw #RapidoHatawBalita #DZRHNationwide @doe_ph
7680 2018-06-02 21:23:56 Dan: If baby oil dissolves condoms, what the hell does it to babies???

Marucho: This may shock you but condoms and babies aren‘t made from the same thing.
7681 2018-06-02 21:23:41 The Reason they Gang Up Against Him

"In 2019, we're going to remove oil bloc licences from individuals and give to host communities, because they deserve it"
President M. Buhari
7682 2018-06-02 21:23:04 I went into this store because it said liquidation sale and also it said emu oil so I was curious but I walked out with 3 jugs of protein, buy one get two free I couldn’t pass that shit up, $10 for 3 jugs of protein??! I’m overjoyed
7683 2018-06-02 21:23:04 Yasir mutanen ABU,me I don’t have time to argue. All I know is AUN is the best and I’ll continue saying I’ve graduated from Africa’s best university as far as AUN is concern. With cross examination or not, AUN issa goal wollah
7684 2018-06-02 21:23:01 This mf told me to bring some baby oil and pop rocks 
7685 2018-06-02 21:22:59 2/Now we're into the heart of the issue: cost of rising oil consumption vs. the cost of electrifying transportation. Thus far, you're losing the political battle. Polling data shows very clearly Canadians want a gradual transition with lowest costs possible. How do you change?
7686 2018-06-02 21:22:48 Ditto for Canada & oil sands pipelines @Bill_Morneau; @joycemurray?
7687 2018-06-02 21:22:26 #YPG/#PKK, Syrian regime reached an agreement on sharing oil from the Al-Omar oilfield -- one of the largest oilfields in YPG/PKK-occupied Deir ez-Zor province in eastern #Syria.
7688 2018-06-02 21:22:24 You really shouldn't post selfies, Gunnsie. You're not helping yourself.
7689 2018-06-02 21:22:10 PIPELINES give us a SAFE & efficient method of selling our significant reserves of OIL to Overseas accounts thereby  supporting our Government Services especially developing #  GREEN ENERGY ALTERNATIVES
7690 2018-06-02 21:21:49 Perhaps if automakers didn’t relentlessly promote profitable F150-type trucks and enormous SUV’s, and lobby the government to deregulate fuel economy standards and pollution controls, we wouldn’t need to import so much oil or drill the Arctic/offshore.
7691 2018-06-02 21:21:42 Chopped, blended with parsley, garlic, and olive oil, and then tossed with pasta.
7692 2018-06-02 21:21:38 Now that it is summer and my parking lot is pretty far from my office, can any of you recommend some good oil blotting papers?
7693 2018-06-02 21:21:30 whats better than being freshly shaved and covered in coconut oil...ill wait 
7694 2018-06-02 21:21:29 We make millions of dollars daily on oil sales alone and yet we are still one of the poorest countries in the world, I doubt there will be any difference if those jerseys were made in Aba..
7695 2018-06-02 21:21:17 You forgot to mention the men he saved @ the oil rig, the lady @ the bar, Lois @ the scout ship, his own mother. The soldier falling out of the helicopter, the bus of kids as a teen, Lois in the pod, Lois falling from the ship, that family when he killed Zod.
7696 2018-06-02 21:21:15 Wow. Chipotle Ranch has 6 grams less fat than Newman's Own Oil and Vinegar. #TheMoreYouFuckinKnow
7697 2018-06-02 21:20:58 On a lighter note, for those who have stressful callings , take a bubble bath using Dr. Teals lavender and aloe vera body bash or bath salts.  99% of all the sicknesses in the world starts with stress.  When you are stressed, your whole body is stressed.  Lavender oil or...

7699 2018-06-02 21:20:36 I don’t care how black I get I’m still drenching myself in baby oil before I go to the pool
7700 2018-06-02 21:20:17 During a sleepover, Louie Gohmert calmly tells President Trump that transgender people are drilling for oil. Tila Tequila turns the corner.
7701 2018-06-02 21:20:16 This Nike Nigeria jersey partnership is the same thing with the oil exploration in the Niger Delta. Those companies are there to drill oil but not to help Nigeria refine locally.
7702 2018-06-02 21:20:12 standard oil and at&t survived break-ups  so should amazon
7703 2018-06-02 21:20:00 The same tire that tore in December just torn again so I need a new tire, new brakes, new headlights, an oil change
7704 2018-06-02 21:20:00 Aphogee 2 step protein treatment, Aussie moist conditioner and argon oil!
7705 2018-06-02 21:19:58 Agree. It’s the same, everywhere. At @UW SOM a lot of oil paintings of dead white people.
7706 2018-06-02 21:19:53 It would probably help you a TON, Michelle. The oil doesn't make you high.
7707 2018-06-02 21:19:44 I use a combination of shea butter, castor oil, coconut oil and virgin olive oil and it has really helped with my hair growth, maybe try that, also, let the hair rest sometimes.
7708 2018-06-02 21:19:42 For the energy independence, ultimately, global dependence on oil is required to maintain demand for U.S. dollars and this demand is needed to keep the U.S. dollar global reserve currency. This is why energy independence is not here yet.
7709 2018-06-02 21:19:34 these ~creative~ yt girls r sooo shameless deadass they’ll be like ur perfect for my uni project i want to shoot u drenched in oil naked outside a council estate for aesthetics
7710 2018-06-02 21:19:34 Apples to oranges though (?) as thermal loses are included in diesel's 50mpg but not in the EV's 140mpge. Energy from oil (1700kWh /$80 barrel) comes in at around 3.5p/kWh compared with electricity of around 10p/kWh. EV's mpge would need to be ~3 better than ICE to brake even?
7711 2018-06-02 21:19:16 Bitches clinging on to BTS now that they r more popular. And they slipping right off bc we all coated our boys with lavender smelling coconut oil. For soft skin and lavished hair

7717 2018-06-02 21:18:37 According to NUC ranking for this year A.B.U Zaria came the first in Nigeria,so if AUN can't come first in Nigeria you dnt talk about Africa.Go and put your house in order.

7720 2018-06-02 21:18:02 Low THC CBD oil did not help this young man. He tried the whole plant medicine with THC and went 71 days without a seizure. He has had daily seizures since they took him from his parents.

7728 2018-06-02 21:16:25 Is it really economically viable to truck oil from Turkana to the port of Mombasa?Or has something snapped?!
7729 2018-06-02 21:16:07 It cures everything except the need for more CBD oil.

7764 2018-06-02 21:11:37 @tesco @sainsburys @waitrose @marksandspencer @coopukfood @Greenpeace @GreenpeaceBR @GreenpeaceUK NO MORE PALM OIL
7765 2018-06-02 21:11:24 There is probably enough oil on earth to last the next 1000 years. The problem is accessible oil, most oil isn't accessible and will only become accessible in the next million years
7766 2018-06-02 21:11:16 Accommodation in AUN is perhaps the best. With 24/7 water and electricity supply, unlimited internet access, 24hr e-library (the biggest in Sub-Saharan Africa) , 24hr air conditioned rooms, and over 600 securities working day and night at close locations within campus.

7770 2018-06-02 21:10:26 It's clear to anyone who can read that I accept him as president since I'm encouraging him to resign. People like you need to get over the fact that he's, at best, an unethical snake oil salesman (& you bought,) & at worst, a criminal. Ties to Russia have been shown either way.
7771 2018-06-02 21:10:09 By the way ,you  people screaming ,global warming,cooling,whatever 're term you are using ,have you sold your car and stoped heating your house with oil

He lies he manipulates and sells snake oil to gullible people. I really hope 1 day you wake up and nitemare is over.
7782 2018-06-02 21:08:24 Coconut oil and aloe are also possibilities. Don't use things with sugar in them (no honey or jam, for example) or things involving animals fats, which go rancid.

7786 2018-06-02 21:07:54 no, no, no

Skin OIL
7787 2018-06-02 21:07:30 Fank yoo!  Mom says Sparkey sent em.  All cleaned n steel wooled now.  Need some coats of Shaker Oil next. Long project but she likes.

7788 2018-06-02 21:07:28 And use olive oil plus calculate your calorie count. Ye na ho ye kerny sy gain ker jaao

7790 2018-06-02 21:07:11 Yep guess he his bn manipulated for financial gains bybsome people. Mr kenny is an IT guy and also into oil and gas he his self made that much i know of him and his twin brother.
7791 2018-06-02 21:06:59 Regulations don’t allow P/L in backyard or close to other property. Pipelines are safer than oil trains running thru centre of many major cities. Stoping oil from moving won’t happen. We just get to pick the method
7792 2018-06-02 21:06:56 It wasn't left in rain it was covered in motor oil!
7793 2018-06-02 21:06:50 Oil prices rose after Trump pulled out of Iran nuclear deal which raised gas prices enormously ...This puts a huge dent in consumers pockets and hurt consumer spending which is 70% of the economy.
7794 2018-06-02 21:06:44 Trump could ask his handler,Putin to pump more oil. Increasing supply , making the price of oil cheaper making the price of gasoline cheaper
7795 2018-06-02 21:06:37 Not when you look at shale oil production decline, reserves and profitability (often lack thereof).
7796 2018-06-02 21:06:29 If you think entertainment and politics are oil and water, you know absolutely nothing of the history of art and entertainment.  This is just embarrassing.  Way to go, youth of America, make these types of people scared.  You are on the right side of history.  Lead on.
7797 2018-06-02 21:06:22 MOVIE industry is tax subsdized? And the oil industry? BC subsidizes the by 345 mill a year. Canada by 3.3 Billion. Factor that into the price of oil and it’s no longer cheap. Renewables provide 8 x the jobs and don’t kill the planet.
7798 2018-06-02 21:06:15 Thanks bud. I was hoping to avoid a bigger intervention than 0000 wool. How about a wax stick then danish oil...?
7799 2018-06-02 21:06:07 確かにつまむにはちょうどいい…。でも腹は膨れないw
7800 2018-06-02 21:06:05 Boil it first then let it soak, preferably run some cold water on it so it doesn't stick then get in the pan or something with beforehand having oil and the flavors or whatever you like in it.

7804 2018-06-02 21:05:25 I blame him somewhat for the rise in prices when he pulled out of the Iran deal and the market factored in the loss of their oil.
7805 2018-06-02 21:05:16 Extracted when drilling oil or if from the US it will be from Fracking

Fracking Industry will love it
7806 2018-06-02 21:05:07 How do you reconcile promoting islam and gay rights? Mixing oil and water?
7807 2018-06-02 21:05:01 Cos some snake oil salesmen sold idea that USA is new Rugby frontier. And then didn’t have the foresight to include team USA as one of the competing teams

7813 2018-06-02 21:03:45 I hate how dry my scalp gets, even when I oil it. That’s why I wear wigs, I can just snatch it off and scratch all I need to 
7814 2018-06-02 21:03:32 Let me see. Our oil and gas industry is beholden to the USA.  How does BC want the rest of Canada to support BC jobs?
7815 2018-06-02 21:03:19 What are you talking about? I taught you how to clean it. You didn't even know you were supposed to oil it after you cleaned it. 
7816 2018-06-02 21:03:17 You dropping oil on your foot was written in the book.
7817 2018-06-02 21:03:15 When we look at these world crises: Italy, Brexit, Ukraine, Eurocrisis, Trump’s polarization, North Korea, Trade Wars, disunity of the West, high oil, Iran policy, instability in Qatar, Israel, and Syria, one must ask, who benefits m? Only one answer comes to mind ... Russia.
7818 2018-06-02 21:02:52 All of Canada is personally invested in the oil sands. To claim otherwise is sheer ignorance. The reason Canada weathered the '08 recession was largely due to resource revenue. Every province in this country has a vested interest in seeing these projects supported.
7819 2018-06-02 21:02:51 If you’re a male and don’t know how to change oil or a tire you’re sad. If you’re a female and can do it you’re a blessing.
7820 2018-06-02 21:02:48 Trump IS to blame for our jump in gas & oil prices...as a reward to Putin for stealing the election for him. 

But those who are the cult followers of Trump will never "see" it. Or just don't care.
7821 2018-06-02 21:02:48 I kept hearing Hamid trying to talk to his defenders. I couldn't quite make it out but it sounded like "oil can".

7823 2018-06-02 21:02:29 And we just spent 4.5 billion dollars on a pipeline when 7.3 million barrels of oil per day will be displaced by EVs...

7827 2018-06-02 21:02:20 Hell no, I am just average Joe citizen, the problem however as my ignorant-self sees it is that we are not moving towards an understanding that we do not have to wait until the last drop of oil is burned.
7828 2018-06-02 21:01:59 This is Nigeria! if government finds oil in your backyard it's government property, but if they find weed it's yours and you are going to jail.
7829 2018-06-02 21:01:55 Sorry; we can’t support this initiative of building reservoirs to conserve water;we have to support orange train; we also support Independent power producers (IPPs) to continue producing costly electricity from furnace oil  compared with cheap power produced from water; patriots!
7830 2018-06-02 21:01:53 Can I suggest you take a look at CBD oil. it's completely legal in the UK. Make sure to do some research and shop around for a reputable source
7831 2018-06-02 21:01:51 Plus we have so much oil here in the USA that really hasn't been dipped in to. You eat up their lies like M&M's don't you????
7832 2018-06-02 21:01:43 Might be a daft question, but where can I get CBD oil from? Locally, not online...

7835 2018-06-02 21:01:07 MOORE & ORTIZ, OPINION writers are partisan fools who are supporting Trump's destructive agenda. Apparently they don't even have their facts straight. The Keystone Pipeline was mostly for exporting oil to make money, not for our own use. BAD deal, especially for our environment

7837 2018-06-02 21:00:20 1. Always carry extra car fluids. Oil, radiator fluid, heck even brake fluid. 
2. If your car is more than 3 years old, not a bad idea to both have and learn how to change an alternator. No alternator = no power.
7838 2018-06-02 21:00:18 Try mixing essential oils for it!! It has made one of mine disappear just about 100% in basically 2 days! I think I used teatree oil with lavender oil mixed with coconut oil, but I would search it up too hope this helps even a lil bit!

7859 2018-06-02 20:57:07 Wrong, the market determines the price of a barrel of oil. The US is nearly oil independent.

7874 2018-06-02 20:55:21 As a complementary, if we want to sell our gas (or oil) to the US (and we do), we have to compete with the prices they can produce at.  Other refineries, such as those in Saskatchewan have operated at very low margins due to this.
7875 2018-06-02 20:55:20 Thatcher used North Sea oil revenues, to pay dole. She privatized, sold and asset strip public utilities. The public infrastructure and industry became neglected. Many areas that voted leave still suffer intergenerational unemployment.
7876 2018-06-02 20:54:55 Meh.  Hate oil but embrace coal.  BC failed logic.
7877 2018-06-02 20:54:53 Of course you need to transport the oil from Midland to Houston. Uber? Train? Cause pipelines are not an option.

7882 2018-06-02 20:54:21 Can’t you even read. Their tweet states they want to end dependency on carbon based energy. That would include oil from OPEC, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. With your constant attacks, it is clear you don’t have much of a case for the pipeline that makes and sense at all.
7883 2018-06-02 20:54:19 Ok, for every dollar made burning oil, spend 50 cents building or researching renewable resources.

7887 2018-06-02 20:53:34 There are fifteen refineries in Canada. Happy to see more; we should work on improving the investment climate. TransMountain carries refined products from Alberta refineries. It also delivers unrefined oil to the refinery in Burnaby BC, and to two others in Washington state.

7923 2018-06-02 20:48:10 You stated: ‘British Columbians need oil just as much as anyone else. ‘ I pointed out this ‘oil’ is not for BC, or even . I didn’t say it wouldn’t benefit the economy only that it was to be exported to and for foreign markets
7924 2018-06-02 20:47:56 i dropped frying hot oil on my foot haha if i get a burn mark it will never fade haha this hurts haha
7925 2018-06-02 20:47:39 Oil was quite the way to go in the past!
Yeah definitely not sex education kind of material xD (not offense for any fic of course!) still when I see split used as LEGITIMATE lube (like from people clearly convinced it would work in any normal life situation) Im just 
7926 2018-06-02 20:47:29 Our President 100% correct!  In spite of this, the Dems say that they support the evil of sharia law...last time I checked, America is a Judea-Christian nation.  Christianity and sharia mix as well as oil and water.
7927 2018-06-02 20:47:15 Another snake oil product, are people really that gullible?
7928 2018-06-02 20:47:13 An oil change turned into $1200 real quick
7929 2018-06-02 20:46:48 I use a lotion, cream, frizz gel , oil then a setting foam.
7930 2018-06-02 20:46:41 I feel the same way about the Sox logo but getting a Sox hat after the Cubs win feels like cheering for an oil company or something
7931 2018-06-02 20:46:39 Ooo I feel you on the itching. If and when you try again, try buying tea tree oil and putting some on your scalp, it smells a little weird but it goes and away and it’s a reliiiief
7932 2018-06-02 20:46:38 Cheesesteak wit turkey bacon straight oil 
7933 2018-06-02 20:46:30 Also public service announcement: Oil trains are worse than oil pipelines. If we have to choose one, it should always be oil pipelines. But we should be decreasing our oil dependency by increasing our mass transit infrastructure
7934 2018-06-02 20:46:26 There are biodegradable bags ready to market, but plastic is made from gas and oil, so...
7935 2018-06-02 20:46:20 That picture just stained my white. Look at all that oil FFS.

7938 2018-06-02 20:45:43 Couples run errands like oil changes and stuff together??? Can’t relate
7939 2018-06-02 20:45:40 Gawd I’m already terrified of Labor this didn’t help me but I’ve been doing pelvic exercises (kegals) and exercising period can help prevent tearing. My doula also told me to use coconut oil so I don’t tear!

7942 2018-06-02 20:45:22 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
7943 2018-06-02 20:44:57 ふりーふーど…!
7944 2018-06-02 20:44:56 putting tea tree oil on your roots helps a ton! also whole blends shampoo + conditioner helped my hair grow quickly after the lady screwed up my hair. don't stress it too much tho bc your hair grows unevenly and it'll start looking even soon.
7945 2018-06-02 20:44:50 おお！
おめでとうございます
7946 2018-06-02 20:44:36 Civilizations are being judged by how much energy they create and where its being siphoned from. Nigeria is so dependent on fossil fuel that we fail to realize that one day, it'll be depleted. Then what? 
The transition will take its toll on us, that's if we find the oil revenue.
7947 2018-06-02 20:44:22 クラブはご飯を出すべき
7948 2018-06-02 20:44:14 I said fuck an oil change bitch I did the race
7949 2018-06-02 20:44:05 ( my mentions are going to be full of coconut oil, watch)
7950 2018-06-02 20:43:49 defence spending & take pleasure in sending Trident to wherever you want to base it. Rump UK's budget will be struggling without Scottish oil to bale it out; on top of brexit, it's a "brave" claim you'll be better off! 
7951 2018-06-02 20:43:28 それなんですよねー。徹夜明けは腹が減る
7952 2018-06-02 20:43:06 Cetaphil and coconut oil.
7953 2018-06-02 20:42:56 Well How much is Canada paying to run an oil line right in the middle of America? No benefits for us on that deal.
7954 2018-06-02 20:42:49 Seriously? Surely a country with oil and gas can produce rubbing alcohol!
7955 2018-06-02 20:42:49 Making cannabis olive oil cuz health is wealth 
7956 2018-06-02 20:42:47 Do you recommend any fish oil or other supplements when doing the 3:1?
7957 2018-06-02 20:42:46 A friend just pointed out that Myull record is 4-2-0 while I was outside vaping my medical cannibindiol oil 
#scg #regionals #mtg #merfolk #modern
7958 2018-06-02 20:42:21  I realized I didn’t have oil when I was putting it together. Luckily they included it with the mower!
7959 2018-06-02 20:41:58 Don’t watch Trudeau or CBC,just stating facts, Canada has massive surplus of everything we produce, we will do just fine, we have surplus hydro, coal,oil , nuclear,timber,gold,iron,If you think we are going to roll over to arrogant American pricks,not going to happen
7960 2018-06-02 20:41:57 ALL ABOUT OIL
7961 2018-06-02 20:41:37 And they are not lying to you at all. Oil change every 3 months insurance and all the unnecessary expenses that come with it. God forbid you pop a tire now that trust me lol.
7962 2018-06-02 20:41:35 675 squeegee pulls this week. Then spent today angle grinding oil drums into garden planters. Arms like Arnie.
7963 2018-06-02 20:41:07 cannabis infused oil in your peanut butter will make you and your dog happy.
7964 2018-06-02 20:40:40 I’m looking good on the TT coverage tonight, very dapper. Call that a tache, @Lee_johnston13, you’re just playing at it. Maybe you need to use more of that beard oil you’re flogging?! 
7965 2018-06-02 20:40:25 Ohh no, drink water? Take a nap? CBD oil?  hope you feel better soon!
7966 2018-06-02 20:40:24 髪がさーサラサラしてるのちょっと気にしてんだよなー
7967 2018-06-02 20:40:23 Haven't they been doing this for decades with the oil. Sell licenses to foreigners then ask them to put their HQ in London or offshore? So all the revenues & profits flow out of Scotland.  I cant wait for the day this all stops.
7968 2018-06-02 20:40:10 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
7969 2018-06-02 20:39:58 You can't support someone who wants to use you as the object to pull himself up.
See everybody is underpaid in Naija except oil workers, senators.
The argument for salary increase should apply to everyone. But its outright foolishness to support someone lying about you.
7970 2018-06-02 20:39:52 ,,,, we have been putting off renewable energy sources for decades and now facing the fall out. Europe is far ahead of us... oil has never been the answer considering the first electric car sold in 1866... forced off the market by oil industry. Society was scammed by petro corps.
7971 2018-06-02 20:39:27 Maybe they remind him of oil wells.
7972 2018-06-02 20:39:25 These oil rich states are more or less pawns to expending forays of the West and Russia
7973 2018-06-02 20:39:20 I have no clue why people do it. It’s like why do people touch POL hair or touch 18th Century oil paintings in museums!?
7974 2018-06-02 20:39:11 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
7975 2018-06-02 20:39:08 Like it or not @JustinTrudeau has allowed oil sands exploration- argument is lost. Under doctrine of paramounts, BC is limited to a narrow legal question: can they limit transport across BC? Court cases have gone against BC - Now that Canada owns pipeline Feds will halt protests
7976 2018-06-02 20:38:59 omg so imagine one time nicole couldn’t come out for an occiasion so brought me a present so i’m like omg ok and it was beard trimmers and beard oil for when i go on T and i think about it everyday what a fucking cutie
7977 2018-06-02 20:38:55 Oil change for my lawnmower and yard work ovo went pretty smoothly except for a surprise fuel leak after starting it ouo
7978 2018-06-02 20:38:51 I've had one for a year. Makes delicious fried potatoes with barely a spoon of oil in 24 minutes. Kinda hard to keep clean tho' but worth it.
7979 2018-06-02 20:38:41 The titration part. I want to laugh, then cry. It's very disturbing. 
That same feeling I had when someone recommended a certain oil for pseudomonas.
7980 2018-06-02 20:38:29 お腹すきましたね
7981 2018-06-02 20:38:09 Coconut oil works for everything. You going through a rough time, use coconut oil. 
7982 2018-06-02 20:37:56 They hate Oil Cans, they're racist.
7983 2018-06-02 20:37:45 We roast them in the oven at 350"°F in olive oil and choice of seasonings and they are to die for! I’ll eat the leftovers every day at lunch! We’ll literally eat a couple pounds of the things in days. Warning: I also eat kale, raw or cooked. Do not, for any reason, boil brussels!
7984 2018-06-02 20:37:38 National parks must be for people, plants, pumas - not Big Oil...
7985 2018-06-02 20:37:35 Went for an oil change the other day, after they refilled my oil the guy comes over to me and shows me this stick with oil on it like I’m supposed to know what that means..so I went along with it and said “that looks great” #noclue #TrueStory
7986 2018-06-02 20:37:35 Go swim in your Oil
7987 2018-06-02 20:37:23 What if Obama stopped all oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico contrary to Court Order.  Is that obstruction of justice? 

No reflection from Literally not Seriously crowd.
7988 2018-06-02 20:36:57 I have read that in Ancient Greece, which was a culture that thought sex between 2 men was even superior than straight sex (quite misogynistic but not the point) olive oil was used so much for that purpose that its arguably the reason it was so cultivated/appreciated in Greece.
7989 2018-06-02 20:36:51 i turned abbachios wine into olive oil. thats for the piss you dick
7990 2018-06-02 20:36:43 I agree 100%!  Great having you back on the tele. I hope you become a more permanent character. I haven't missed an episode of @etvImbewu. Maluju Oil needs your presence. All the best.
7991 2018-06-02 20:36:31 There are over 1,000 shipping vessels on the oceans each day. The air pollution from one ship ( bunker oil used to power ships) is equivalent to the exhaust from 50,000 cars. And where do you think they throw their garbage each day?? Laws needed soon.
7992 2018-06-02 20:36:27 But they are not okay with it are they? Only the ogliarchs are making the dollars from their oil deals and money made during the USSR split. The amount of poverty and inhumane treatment is shocking. Those who dare stand up are either imprisoned or killed.
7993 2018-06-02 20:36:24 With today's regulations in regards to underground petroleum product storage, an oil change facility costs anywhere from 750k to 2 million dollars to build out. I will continue to lease existing facilities. Fortunately JiffyLube already has done the feasibility studies
7994 2018-06-02 20:36:23 Only the Bold Beardsman oil and balm are expensive. Maestro’s and Shea Moisture you can find at Target.
7995 2018-06-02 20:36:14 Rebecca Otto is Minnesota’s finest snake oil salesperson. Wow. #DFL2018
7996 2018-06-02 20:36:12 @NissanCoolSprings. Kuddos for the service department. Brian checked my Quest in for a routine oil change, and they completed the job in record time, washed my car, gave me a detailed report of the various aspects of the car, and charged less than I have paid anywhere.
7997 2018-06-02 20:35:57 Nah mate u know u can't mix water and oil together
7998 2018-06-02 20:35:55 Archival records show oil lifting from the ND some 50 yrs prior to the publicly declared 1957

YET,, yet the European expatriates cannot fly an aircraft from Italy to Brass

They stop at Lagos & then find their way to our guinea pig environs

Make the Fed argument for ND...7/
7999 2018-06-02 20:35:49 I don't know about you but I would love to have the USA not dependent on foreign oil
8000 2018-06-02 20:35:39 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
8001 2018-06-02 20:35:35 What i enjoy EVEN MORE than hearing basic shit is when someone’s tip is utter horsehit, case in point: adding oil to pasta as it boils.
8002 2018-06-02 20:35:32 WesternSahara of Egypt or Iraq or Algeria? Sahara extends from Morocco to MiddleEast. Actually. Each country has its own Western Sahara. Laletly, they discovered oil in WesternSahara of Egypt?
8003 2018-06-02 20:35:28 Just listen to a pod cast talking about 10s of billions being poures into alaska for oil, gas, minerals and infrastructure. Capacity is coming back on line yhay has been dormant for 2 decades in the rust belt.
8004 2018-06-02 20:35:27 You suggest just printing loads of money? OMG. as if the pound hasn't fallen enough already... And most of our expenses such as money owing to the rest of the EU, or buying oil internationally is priced in Euros or US dollars... Learn how the economy works? LOL
8005 2018-06-02 20:35:24 Mungkin ko x ngam sama oil cleanser yg ada mineral oil kali kin. Cuba try yg teda mineral oil? Mungkin la  Sama acid exfoliator BHA
8006 2018-06-02 20:35:22 Ye said unto the Lord, and go to them with oil olive, and make the brethren.
8007 2018-06-02 20:35:19 $40 dollars for an oil change and car wash turned into $100 wahhhh but my car needed the wash specially really bad.
8008 2018-06-02 20:35:17 Is it safe for the nether region?

Did you know the reason a persons pits and nether region smell so bad is those two area's, unlike the rest of you body, secretes an oil?
8009 2018-06-02 20:35:14 We are working for us 
Our passion for your oil
8010 2018-06-02 20:35:03 Bout to be at this Nigerian event asking if they used peanut oil 
8011 2018-06-02 20:34:53 I'd even be a little suspicious of Olive oil unless you know your getting a superior product. Best to stick with animal fat and coconut oil and perhaps Avocado. Ghee is an excellent choice as is Lard, Tallow and cold water fish fats.
8012 2018-06-02 20:34:32 vape oil. Please I must see
8013 2018-06-02 20:34:31 LOVE to walk around Los Angeles and listen to people talk about CBD oil

8017 2018-06-02 20:33:36 Too bad. Looks like you sold out and decided to be political and join a liberal basher Make sure that is what you want because you can't go back on social media. Entertainment and politics are oil and water.
8018 2018-06-02 20:33:36 nutox cleansing oil
8019 2018-06-02 20:33:11 I’ve seen oil tankers that turn quicker
8020 2018-06-02 20:33:10 Oil... Evraz is a major oil pipe manufacturer and Exxon is a major oil company.
8021 2018-06-02 20:32:52 Hasnt even been a month and my dad doing an oil change to the semi this man puts miles down
8022 2018-06-02 20:32:49 I hear he installed one at work. That’s how he ended up with brain damage. He installed it between two walls. Repeated strikes to the head while bending over, IYKWIM...
8023 2018-06-02 20:32:36 Coconut oil 
8024 2018-06-02 20:32:14 You forget that while American military power has helped to keep “the peace” for many years, the flip side is that the projection through other countries allowed the US to manage a number of interests overseas, including oil supply. And that role as World Policeman was ....
8025 2018-06-02 20:32:01 Scary stuff.....better stick to Olive Oil or Ghee.....What did you say?
8026 2018-06-02 20:31:59 Resource curse.  Little labor needed to extract oil.  No possibility of large-scale agriculture.  Tourism limited to the haj.  Unattractive living conditions for international tech and finance.
8027 2018-06-02 20:31:56 Somebody said he’s like an oil spill
8028 2018-06-02 20:31:56 get the tanning oil out
8029 2018-06-02 20:31:40 They will probably give them government jobs next, like maybe in the oil and gas business. 
8030 2018-06-02 20:31:28 That's not true. The recession was the result of oil prices dropping dramatically. While fiscal restraint and increased tax in Sask is more responsible to future generations, it hit their economy harder and Alta is bouncing back faster. Check some of @trevortombe good work
8031 2018-06-02 20:31:24 For like the first six months, then I just used the tea oil and clips and wavecap overnight to hold em down
8032 2018-06-02 20:30:57 I don’t believe in oil changes
8033 2018-06-02 20:30:53 Nick Ackerman: Donald Trump is a flim-flam artist trying to sell his next bottle of snake oil.
8034 2018-06-02 20:30:41 You're forgetting about the genocide.
8035 2018-06-02 20:30:15 2/ Don't put all your eggs into one basket. Don't count on eggs unless you can control the price of eggs.

 is not a major producer globally. We have one big customer. Putting faith in oil and gas is asking for economic trouble. That's what tanked Venezuela.
8036 2018-06-02 20:30:12 Petroleum, or crude oil, forms when tiny little sea animals and plants die and then get mixed up with sand and slit on the sea floors.
8037 2018-06-02 20:30:05 Started cannabis oil today see if it helps my rheumatoid disease? Don't know yet but I'm gonnae watch the doors and eat some crisps.
8038 2018-06-02 20:30:03 hey @Yelp Is it possible to search results only for businesses that have been permenantly closed. Specifically I want to search for all the listings under "Oil Change Stations" that are marked as closed.

Thanks @yelpsupport
8039 2018-06-02 20:30:03 @TomGaymor I'm watching from a north sea oil rig, looking forward to my Detroit trip in September

8042 2018-06-02 20:29:42 racism is wrong & there's no excuse.
FYI; zionist roseanne racist-comment-scandal is a pro-trump netanyahu anti-iran psyop to distract from trump netanyahu israel zio crimes against palestinians. meanwhile zios break iran deal & are pushing war with iran for their oil masters.
8043 2018-06-02 20:29:32 An oil sheikhdom which had to lobby US and trick its population for protection back in 90's? A sustainable and not at all exceptional economy indeed.

Okay, let's do this. Let's see where most refugees in US are actually from. Then let's check America's military history in that\
8044 2018-06-02 20:29:22 @Avon_UK re. Skin So Soft Original Dry Oil Spray.  Can you confirm that it still contains citronella pls?  Ingredients not displayed on new bottles. Thanks

8046 2018-06-02 20:28:40 Mueller is running a tight ship that doesn’t leak. The WH, on the other hand, has been leaking like an offshore oil rig since day one.

8051 2018-06-02 20:28:13 "The best way to keep gas prices as low as possible is for Democrats to give up their opposition to domestic oil production and permanently shelve their gas tax increase proposals"

Actually, I think the better idea is to move from fossil fuels to renewables, but that's just me.
8052 2018-06-02 20:28:08 Don’t recommend oil pulling when you have a cough hahaha just nearly died 
8053 2018-06-02 20:28:05 If you’re suggesting there are no alternative markets or that it isn’t safer and cheaper to transport oil through a pipeline than by truck- those arguments seem weak and every expert disagrees. Argument that bitumen should be left in the ground, has already been lost
8054 2018-06-02 20:28:02 With all our oil money, ours is more than 80%.
8055 2018-06-02 20:28:00 
8056 2018-06-02 20:27:58 I shouldn’t be allowed near kitchens for the remainder of this week.

Monday I burned myself with a baking tray (still pretty badly burned)
Wednesday I spilled hot oil on my foot.
And not long ago I sliced my finger with the blunt end of a knife...
8057 2018-06-02 20:27:57 Stop pretending like this matters, it’s the economic cycle!  I’m not a Trump supporter either, but this kind of ignorance annoys me!  It’s like crediting Obama for lower oil prices (it was supply and demand!).  I expect better from a financial reporter
8058 2018-06-02 20:27:56 Look at the way he controlled the oil industry, taxed citizens and increased regulations. I thought he was amazing when he first took power and then I realized where that road leads. I feel bad for Venezuela but I’m glad I got to see what that ideology manifests.
8059 2018-06-02 20:27:56 It’s also sprinkle some oil on “Rey’s parentage”

8062 2018-06-02 20:27:14 Nothing is better than an ice cold @budweiserusa  after changing the oil for your motorcycle.
8063 2018-06-02 20:27:07 I've seen egg whites and olive oil? But do not quote me on if that's 100% safe  The egg whites I don't believe, maybe the Olive oil

8066 2018-06-02 20:26:44 "Kerrison got the science ramped up" super high cadence seated aero climbing attacks (never before or since), reverse periodisation (WTF), torque work (been around a zillion years), discovered Teide (conveniently distant from A-D). Marginal smoke and mirrors with added snake oil.
8067 2018-06-02 20:26:43 1/ People who are ignorant of what happened in Venezuela shouldn't invoke it. What happened was V had 50% of GDP and 95% of exports tied up in oil and gas. Then the Saudis forced the prices down. We felt it in  with only 9%/14%, but V economy was ruined. Here's the lesson:
8068 2018-06-02 20:26:39 The thing is that oil is rebounding at tge same time as the policies put in place by the ndp are kicking in. Had it not been for the ndp growth and no austerity policies, we would only see a little growth due to oil rebounding. UCP has no other plan then cuts +cuts = regression
8069 2018-06-02 20:26:38 I tried it with a facial oil I already had & then with a primer and neither worked 
8070 2018-06-02 20:26:37 Nonsense. Oil prices crashed in the early 1990s, we recovered quite nicely without the massive overspending.
8071 2018-06-02 20:26:24 Spent some time in Norway. Love their system, higher cost & all. But they’re funded by a nationalized oil industry. They are also predominantly homogenous. Lots of ppl here would cut out their own eye before helping black/brown ppl (& racism is prevalent in Scandinavia too).
8072 2018-06-02 20:26:14 I don't get how people aren't complaining about gas prices and oil right now and oil prices are still at record low levels... fuck $4.88?!
8073 2018-06-02 20:26:08 when you go to town for an oil change and come home with 4 new shirts, a dog toy, and groceries you didn’t plan on buying..

8081 2018-06-02 20:24:59 I saw a new ‘even more spreadable spreadable’ butter in Waitrose yesterday. I thought it might just be oil in a tub.

8111 2018-06-02 20:22:06 Oil prices are going up even higher real soon
8112 2018-06-02 20:21:42 They can’t supply the whole country,We will be like Nigeria,December they run out of petrol,worse they have got oil but no refineries
8113 2018-06-02 20:21:39 Clean: yes. Greasy: can't be recycled. (Grey bin waste is incinerated for power generation, so that oil & fat is still being put to use...)

8115 2018-06-02 20:21:26 .... we have been bullshitted on resources... all we need is more refineries. Remember, they wanted to build the pipeline FROM Alberta to Texas refineries. In BC, Alberta oil goes through pipeline to Washington state, refined and sent back to us at higher price!!!

8117 2018-06-02 20:21:13 There are none, bro. Sorry. The Asian markets are a fiction. Know how much of our bitumen went to Asia in the last 7 years? 600 000 barrels. Not even a whole tanker. In 7 years. And in that time HUGE amounts of cheaper, cleaner oil became available from the US.

8119 2018-06-02 20:20:27 Our club will grow when they will start to act like a football club and not like an oil company.
8120 2018-06-02 20:20:21 Personally I wish the government all the best in transportation of oil from Lokichar to Lamu though a lot of questions not yet answered especially Environmental implications and the 5% of the community.  They can silence our leaders but they can't silence us
8121 2018-06-02 20:20:19 If we weren't importing things we already have, the prices wouldn't be so high. Oil, for example. We have plenty of our own, but, we still import it from countries that hate us. That's why the gas prices are so high.

8126 2018-06-02 20:19:39 Infact @UKenyatta should flag off the tankers and follow them to Kainuk Drift, the River Malmalite might sweep the trucks away and spill the oil.
8127 2018-06-02 20:19:24 I know we are free thinkers and wouldn’t allow someone or some party to tell us how to think or how to vote. 

I know each one of us has done our research to support our arguments and views.

I know we are not buying snake oil from Democrats.

8131 2018-06-02 20:19:08 No accident. And the AB NDP have done remarkably well despite so many rookies - as well as or better than the more experienced PCAA. The NDP didn't devastate the economy - that started with oil prices before the were elected.

When fearmongering through lies is all you have...

8138 2018-06-02 20:18:02 Scotland has only to look at Norway to see where its oil money would have been if independent since its discovery, its what McCrone warned about. Instead it has a "geographical share" of around 9% , when it rightfully should have had 100%.

Thats 30 years of parasitism to address
8139 2018-06-02 20:17:50 My coconut oil is solid again. 
8140 2018-06-02 20:17:31 Yes.  Now there’s a company in Colorado that produces the oil for treatment of seizures but it’s only legal in states that have legalized marijuana.  It’s called charlottes webb.
8141 2018-06-02 20:17:22 So many people done wrote me bout some baby oil  no they’re just naturally shiny af. They on swole in real life.

8146 2018-06-02 20:16:41 If you are trying at a high enough temperature and maintain that temp, you just have to let the surface drip dry.  The bubbles that come off the food are a good indicator, that's interior water being turned into steam, when that stops oil can start sleeping in.
8147 2018-06-02 20:16:40 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

8150 2018-06-02 20:16:26 It didn't cost you anything because they are supposed to check it when they change your oil, assuming you got anything other than the bare minimum option. They do that crap all the time.

8155 2018-06-02 20:15:40 It is SO beside the point! We have lots of great vegan chefs/restauranteurs and when they’re feeling out interest on new menu items someone is ALWAYS like, “can you make it with no oil or sugar?”
8156 2018-06-02 20:15:34 Banning plastic straws is fine, but drilling for oil off Florida’s (money-making, tourism-attracting, environmentally vital) coasts is officially on the table right now. No objection to doing the easy thing, but it shouldn’t be a big energy-sucking fight. We have that elsewhere.

8158 2018-06-02 20:15:28 When I worked in the oil industry, often the only time I could attend conferences was on the weekend- and it's the same for many other industries that are not flexible about taking time off for continuing education. 

Having child care on-site opens up the weekend as an option.

8166 2018-06-02 20:14:28 Do you think the experiences with Russia would become more pleasant, if we stopped buying its oil & gas, destabilizing the country as the result?

Not to mention that our energy supply would become too dependent from the USA. Trump's and @GOP's USA.

Neither is enticing.

8190 2018-06-02 20:10:36 ITJM, or shouldn’t the Feds try to increase the value of oil assets by creating customers other than US, which will enable more sizable investments in renewable energy? Canada has the 3rd largest oil reserves and only .05% of world’s population-  why is gas $1.60 per litre

8200 2018-06-02 20:09:06 That’s the marketing and profit plan of big oil. Has been from the get go.
8201 2018-06-02 20:08:42 I got some pure thc oil that shit be having u stuck 
8202 2018-06-02 20:08:40 I need more oil
8203 2018-06-02 20:08:37 You know what was the crude oil price then?
8204 2018-06-02 20:08:35 More like an oil pan
8205 2018-06-02 20:08:26 "BC" is not the lower mainland or the Island and according to your own source BC is producing and refining plenty of it's own oil. Not many hard numbers in that summary.

8207 2018-06-02 20:08:04 I forgot how much I love warm Italian bread with oil & balsamic vinegar! Could eat it all night.
8208 2018-06-02 20:08:00 The Doctor is having a look around holding his oil lamp. #DWBar
8209 2018-06-02 20:07:58 Well, Ryan does have the side thing going on with the glory hole. That might support half his phone bill.
8210 2018-06-02 20:07:56 I’d love to know who the oldest living Robin is and invite them along. The ‘60s Scots? The ‘85 Champions. Be good to welcome back the Gulf Oil legends, too
8211 2018-06-02 20:07:48 He needs not to shade more light. I understood his point, clearly. Thing is, we are either here to share in Bilkisu’s joy or to discuss why she made the statement “Africa’s best university.” It can’t be both. 
8212 2018-06-02 20:07:46 Que combustible de mierda traen a 25, menos mal que solamente compré 10 lts... La camioneta humea dia y noche con ese gas oil 
8213 2018-06-02 20:07:33 The one area that he is a genius is manipulation he has your entire media wrapped round his wee finger he is clearly smarter than all of them that comes I supose with over 50 years of being a snake oil salesman LOL
8214 2018-06-02 20:07:25 Sis google your car see how many quarts of oil it has what type of oil synthetic or conventional or halfsies and maybe even get a deal on Groupon ! Lol don’t let them over charge you it happens a lot.
8215 2018-06-02 20:07:11 Lmaoo I’m not trying to have my hair smelling like vegetable oil 
8216 2018-06-02 20:07:07 As an FYI neither Ghana or Nigeria are classed as North African and Nigeria doesn’t seem to export Oranges either ( oil & by-products mainly )
8217 2018-06-02 20:06:59 Easy to do and very nommy. I used sesame oil to brown beef strips. Added the veggies, a little grated root ginger and splashes of oyster sauce towards the end. Nom nom
8218 2018-06-02 20:06:59 I really want that rms concealer but idk abt putting coconut oil and beeswax under my eyes
8219 2018-06-02 20:06:58 In the north Sea with "your oil".  That's the best you can come up with? "trident" tbh I wanted Scotland to stay but now get on with it. You have to apply for EU membership, you won't get this until your Gdp gets a hell of a lot better! With nicky at the helm you're going nowhere
8220 2018-06-02 20:06:32 The attacks on Joy Reid originated from the left, as she was not a Bernie apologist or snake oil reporter.
8221 2018-06-02 20:06:07 1975... Oil discovered
1975....UK says it will run out in 40 yrs
2015.... Oil still flowing
20??..... Unionist Scots finally able to add and subtract?
8222 2018-06-02 20:06:06 At grease monkey getting my oil changed, asked 'what type of oil'... I'm like whats the evidence based practice for the different types?
#nurseproblems
8223 2018-06-02 20:05:37 If I'm going to do anything structural geology, mining or oil industry related then I'm going to have to go to Wyoming, Montana, or Colorado. Which I'm fine with it. But if I want sedimentology or paleontology then I'm staying here.
8224 2018-06-02 20:05:36 Thank u more... will tension u with the food i make with it... ya owing me castor oil oo.
Eleke puff puff
8225 2018-06-02 20:05:13 Well, they helped my daughter w pain and she took fewer opiates after surgery. She has FASD. Addiction is on her DNA. Live in CO. Many people I know use CBD oil for pain, sleep & anxiety. they say it works. CBD is better than Ativan IMO
8226 2018-06-02 20:05:13 Have you tried peppermint oil capsules?
8227 2018-06-02 20:05:04 Yeah I think ima try the oil thanks
8228 2018-06-02 20:05:02 Did some costings on baking wheat vs gluten-free bread. A loaf of wheat bread would be nudging a dollar, and that's a fairly big loaf using fancy pants olive oil and maybe even some seeds. Bog standard gluten free loaf? Seven bucks at least.
8229 2018-06-02 20:04:59 You can use both but I prefer butter for the soft crispy effect. Olive oil if you don’t like them soft in the middle 
8230 2018-06-02 20:04:58 @PolisForCO I've been fighting for local control over oil & gas issues, but we've got a long way to go. We cannot sacrifice health & safety of the people in CO #WorkingPeoplesForum #copolitics
8231 2018-06-02 20:04:49 Went through all our steaks today, which was impressive. Busy but fun! :D.
*looks at hands , vaguely proud of butter and oil splash-burns*
8232 2018-06-02 20:04:45 600 barrels of crude oil will tomorrow be evacuated from Lokichar, Turkana County, marking the beginning of Kenya’s journey as an oil producing and exporting country. The four trucks known as tank-tainers will be flagged off by President Uhuru Kenyatta from Ngamia 8 well
8233 2018-06-02 20:04:44 Harper killed manufacturing across Canada, he was all about the oil. Between Trudeau and Wynne, everyone has better paying job opportunities. I have been with a manufacturing co. since 2006, it almost went bankrupt,2011/2012 I did. Now business is booming again.. #RuralOntario
8234 2018-06-02 20:04:37 I hate seeing people’s check engine light, oil light, or tire pressure light on in their stories. Go fix that!
8235 2018-06-02 20:04:36 Yeah, I'm pretty tired of this one. Replace "oil" with "asbestos" and think about the morality of your statement.
8236 2018-06-02 20:04:18 And why is real is letting them explore for gas and oil on Syrian land is that why were there
8237 2018-06-02 20:04:02 It’s cryptocurrencies and alternative energy vs oil and big banks. #whowouldwin
8238 2018-06-02 20:03:40 Butter is fucking gross I avoid it at all costs (pro tip: use olive oil and a dash of salt when cooking literally so much better)
8239 2018-06-02 20:03:33 Amen. So true. If only the millions of Morneau Shepell were generated from oil, sold and needed to be delivered via pipe....we can only dream...made advantage easy for his firm once already.
8240 2018-06-02 20:03:18 Exactly, price was same in 2013 when UPA2 was in power.
Also, crude oil taken from Iran on debt. Where the public money has gone allotted for crude oil?
Is it the same with Swis bank?
Mr. Intellectual @JhaSanjay please explain, am not getting this a/c.
Say pl. Ur shares too.
8241 2018-06-02 20:03:09 Just kidding. I miss chamru nala more than chitrakoot or malinger. Was fun to cook assorted rice veggis and oil pulao there after a shower in waterfall.
8242 2018-06-02 20:03:05 I support those boycotting palm oil to save orangutans, but the industry is also causing widespread destruction of human peoples and cultures.
8243 2018-06-02 20:03:03 We're at Toyota getting the Camry's oil changed and this lady is here in the lobby with her two kids and they're being loud, running around, crying and screaming and she's just sitting on her phone not even paying attention 
8244 2018-06-02 20:02:44 Someone from your village just told me you tweeted that a bit early. I poured anointing oil on it.
8245 2018-06-02 20:02:43 Of course, they can. Let them! It’s allowed. All what we know, we are among the best. 
8246 2018-06-02 20:02:32 The costs of accelerated electrification are unclear, yes. Renewable costs keep falling faster than predicted so that cuts both ways.

It's a risk well worth taking since the cost of failing to slash oil use is a game of Russian roulette.
8247 2018-06-02 20:02:27 A little olive oil, salt and pepper, garlic to taste, then sauté over medium heat for about 6-8 minutes.
8248 2018-06-02 20:01:58 My dad washed my car, changed my oil, got it serviced for its recall, and got me new tires all while i was on vacay  love that man 
8249 2018-06-02 20:01:54 Throw a little rosemary in that olive oil, and I'm putting my dinner plans on hold to join you.
8250 2018-06-02 20:01:53 From the posted Links you are stating the obvious challenges facing the oil sector which is domestically refining our oil! There is NO proof whatsoever regarding the crux of this conversation and your false allegations on the most esteemed V.P @ProfOsinbajo
8251 2018-06-02 20:01:46 Thank you for following Angie!
8252 2018-06-02 20:01:38 I remember walking through a pig farm when I was growing up in Yorkshire(the farmer would always wave at us kids as long as we were well behaved) and one sty had a pig bigger than an oil drum on legs that was terrifying lol.
The piglets were cute though.
8253 2018-06-02 20:01:36 Challenges in sales for each of the following industries? Which are the most rewarding? -

SaaS/software/IT/Security (are these different industries within themselves?)

Insurance

Financial services

Real estate

Oil & energy

Telecommunications

Hardware

Biotech/chemicals…
8254 2018-06-02 20:01:25 Another reason to get that pipeline built, imagine if trump taxes our oil more, and we can't get our resources anywhere,
8255 2018-06-02 20:01:16 my parents bought an "air fryer" as a way of frying things w/o oil but that sounds like bs, does anyone know anything
8256 2018-06-02 20:01:11 YouTube! (My friend pointed out afterwards that most of those vids are done in warm climates without salt. That’s why it looks so easy). 

But yeah, there are some things I won’t do cause they’re tricky or because it’s not worth my time (oil changes).

8259 2018-06-02 20:01:06 Not sure what the oil lobby would do; we still require oil. Why not just remove subs? In 2015, the USA withdrew from the Paris Climate Pledge. Every Western nation, other than USA, has fully implemented or in process.  USA West coast is implementing it.
8260 2018-06-02 20:00:58 Yeah, she could hold her breath underwater a long time.... 
8261 2018-06-02 20:00:56 I use olive oil but it still comes in a bottle. I do get stung by bees tho
8262 2018-06-02 20:00:50 Nice. We make our own as well. It’s really easy. Haven’t tried oregano oil yet either. Sounds good.
8263 2018-06-02 20:00:43 Oh that makes sense actually. Saltiness retracted! All sopped up with a piece of bread and olive oil. 
8264 2018-06-02 20:00:21 We all know what the problems are, infrastructure isn't the only challenge, Nigeria didn't have ANY thing, yet,Telcos came in,why? With all the Challenges here,Oil & Gas guys have refused to leave, why?We can still make it work if we want to whilst waiting/building infrastructure
8265 2018-06-02 20:00:04 1) pipelines make lots of money 2) TMX enables 590,000 b/d of Alberta oil sands production, which translates into billions in Canada govt tax revenue 3) AB + industry are already de-carbonizing. Done deal. Paid for by AB carbon levy and industry $$. Good deal, eh? ;0)
8266 2018-06-02 20:00:03 I smoke cbd every night before I go to bed  I have hella anxiety and it would keep me up all night and this is the only thing i found that helps. also lavender is a natural calmer. use an essential oil diffuser or take shit shower w lavender soap. happy napping
8267 2018-06-02 19:59:56 Oh i’m sure Trump has friends and interests in oil/gas that would profit from the increase. There is a reason they rolled out the red carpet for him in Saudi Arabia. 
8268 2018-06-02 19:59:46 There is nothing sustainable about oil sands expansion. I don’t understand how people think we can continue as we are. We have to start somewhere and expansion is not starting.
8269 2018-06-02 19:59:41 Georgia come out of the dark!   CBD oil from medical marijuana or (smoking/ingesting  pot if unavailable )has helped seizures and other conditions for 30 years.  The medical studies are positive, conclusive and many.  It’s time to step up and do the right thing.
8270 2018-06-02 19:59:33 i love how my grandma just sold me a bottle of cbd oil, what a queen
8271 2018-06-02 19:59:16 It's just regular olive oil and butter. Is that wrong? What do you recommend?
8272 2018-06-02 19:59:13 I need someone to rub me down with hot baby oil while Dance for You by Beyoncé plays in the background...
8273 2018-06-02 19:58:45 Sister sister  use bio oil
8274 2018-06-02 19:58:43 Give it rest old man. Snake oil salesman.
8275 2018-06-02 19:58:20 using less FF, as with a tax, is not sufficient. choosing to not drive or fly, eating less meat (until they start feeding them seaweed), and buying local organic helps reduce my insanity, but real change requires oil company bankruptcy.
8276 2018-06-02 19:58:19 His lifetime list is long and disturbing. Weapons manufacturers, tobacco giants, oil companies, Koch Industries.
8277 2018-06-02 19:58:05 All they wanted to do was build a seed oil farm
8278 2018-06-02 19:57:38 This makes me so angry (and could they have, perchance, given him CBD oil without the THC? Might that have worked? That's legal to buy; I know a ton of people who use it with their dogs!)
8279 2018-06-02 19:57:35 Talented girl.
8280 2018-06-02 19:57:29 when i do normal things like get my oil changed i feel like a productive member of society
8281 2018-06-02 19:57:21 Not only did Howard get my oil changed for me but he also got my car washed and wiped down the inside
8282 2018-06-02 19:57:08 Cooked my whole breakfast in weed oil now I’m high as shit smh
8283 2018-06-02 19:57:06 As a resident, candidate, and elected official I've witnessed how our City Council co-governs with oil & gas. I want to see my community have the same access to the Council. - Crystal Murillo #WorkingPeoplesForum #copolitics
8284 2018-06-02 19:56:52 I Think You Can Use Alcohol I Seen People Say That For Laces But Idk If It Still Applies , Id Just Use Some Oil To Be Safe If Anything
8285 2018-06-02 19:56:34 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
8286 2018-06-02 19:56:16 Since they decided to go to aso rock to shake hand with failure. Unless a cleansing oil is poured on them,they will still be losing matches. A word is enough for the wise.
8287 2018-06-02 19:55:52 Because it gives them an opportunity to not talk about net neutrality, infinite war, mass surveillance, oil pipelines, GMOs, environmental destruction, and the continued growing gap between the ultra rich and the rest of us.
8288 2018-06-02 19:55:46 are you on a stovetop dripping in oil
8289 2018-06-02 19:55:33 I'm not sure it does, but you can attribute the savings only once. So either you have clean electricity or you have clean oil. The sequestration still counts somewhere.
8290 2018-06-02 19:55:02 My body be glossy asf with Vaseline and Baby oil. i don’t Play that ashy shit lol
8291 2018-06-02 19:54:58 Lol yea that was the problem. Not the PC cruising for decades on an oil economy with no diversification.

8293 2018-06-02 19:54:44 This pathetic money grubbing piece of swamp scum would sell his mother to the Arabs for a barrel of oil.
8294 2018-06-02 19:54:39 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
8295 2018-06-02 19:54:37 Of course they do Heid...it's a man thing lol x
8296 2018-06-02 19:54:22 Put some coconut oil on it
8297 2018-06-02 19:54:19 Or we could close our borders and become self efficient. We don't need to trade with the USA anymore. Refine our own oil, greenhouse Will give us fruits and vegetables. What else do we need?
8298 2018-06-02 19:54:19 Let me know.  Ive found it few times
It does who knows. Heard Krill oil best....   f oil.

8301 2018-06-02 19:53:23 You are argueing my point for me, you look at what policies have worked, you pick ones that suit your country specifically, you implement and review. Oil isnt a solution, how you utilise it is
8302 2018-06-02 19:53:20 Gunner told her not to shave it and she misunderstood and stopped shaving at all
8303 2018-06-02 19:53:06 Isn't this from/of Carters oil film?
8304 2018-06-02 19:53:05 I went with my friend to get her oil changed. The auto place was grilling free hot dogs outside. She was then informed her she had to get some other unexpected shit fixed. I said look at it this way, 40 dollar hotdog.
8305 2018-06-02 19:53:02 I know I’m not the only one who burns the glade plug-in oils in the oil burner. Probably inhaling cancer, but at least the room smells nice. 
8306 2018-06-02 19:52:54 Hahaha, good grief, they don't realize that many people from all parts of the country work in Alberta in the pipelines, NS sure didn't complain when there oil industry got rescued from the gov and turned it into a profitable project
8307 2018-06-02 19:52:38 CNRL, Syncrude, and Suncor all have Upgraders. They enable those companies to turn cheap Bitumen into Synthetic Crude, which sells for World Oil Prices. Synthetic Crude flows through pipelines without being Diluted. Profits and jobs are shipped to America with the Diluted Bitumen

8313 2018-06-02 19:51:56 Came up here for a oil change ended up spending $200 on some other shit I ain’t come for
8314 2018-06-02 19:51:50 So that's what castor oil was for
8315 2018-06-02 19:51:45 それはありますね
8316 2018-06-02 19:51:38 Not an oil country, but rather a commodities one, many (iron ore, soybean, etc).
8317 2018-06-02 19:51:36 use a cleansing oil or oil based serum and find a moisturiser that works for you! sounds wrong but oil is the best treatment for it, don’t try and dry it out bc oily skin will counteract any dryness by producing more oil :)

8323 2018-06-02 19:51:07 Remember, kids: every barrel of dirty Canadian oil that is not distributed equals one more barrel of oil distributed from good 'ol clean fun-loving human-rights-cherishing Middle East countries.
8324 2018-06-02 19:50:53 That's your classic "Socialism" scenario, and it is doomed to fail, as it has already failed many times already. 
We should send all the liberals of to Venezuela, so they can take a good look, how socialism destroyed a successful nation, which was rich in oil! One of the richest.

8326 2018-06-02 19:50:09 The truly sad thing is that the plastics and oil industries are directly connected and the crooked politicians that rule the world bend over for these corrupt industries. While I’d love for plastics to go away forever it’s certainly not an easy thing to do.
8327 2018-06-02 19:49:53 Also since im super lazy I think im gonna make like diy makeup remover wipes by putting almond oil and rose water in a bottle and soaking cotton pads in it

8336 2018-06-02 19:48:21 50 minutes into racing and we have our first rod through an oil pan.
8337 2018-06-02 19:48:17 YALLLL so last week I ran out of makeup remover and it was late so I couldn't buy any so I tried to just wash my makeup off and it didn't really work so then I googled it and internet said try coconut oik but I can't use coconut oil on my face so I used almond oil
8338 2018-06-02 19:47:57 "But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil." ~Psalms 92:10 #Jesus #God #Bible
8339 2018-06-02 19:47:54 Andy got my windows tinted today, changed my oil, rotated my tires, and did my breaks. Bless his soul.
8340 2018-06-02 19:47:44 Your articles is pure garbage, to lure in gullible ppl to short $TSLA.

Who pay you? Big oil, Legacy Auto or Koch borthers?
8341 2018-06-02 19:47:19 Orange oil and eucalyptus are two that I know of. I think tea tree oil is bad, too. Just be careful and look it up before, if you have pets of any kind.
8342 2018-06-02 19:47:10 電波ソング→萌えソングではない。と思う
8343 2018-06-02 19:47:06 Good effort. I sincerely hope that isn't a refined oil your fish is being cooked in the.
8344 2018-06-02 19:46:47 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
8345 2018-06-02 19:46:37 Just how much of applications that need oil can be run by electricity?

That can be handled by solar, wind and nuclear - and of nuclear, we get a lot out of very little.

Then, there's Thorium, a nuclear fuel within India.
8346 2018-06-02 19:46:35 You ever focus so hard you forgot what you were focused on? I was pouring oil in a squirt bottle super focused and overfilled it because I was so zoned into the pour. I guess it slipped my mind.
8347 2018-06-02 19:46:15 And 2 hours later I pronounce the kitchen to be cleanerish, or at least mostly visibly clean. So I didn't use Murphy's oil soap on the cabinets of wipe down the walls or vacuum the curtains. I cleaned the counters, stove, microwave, and miscellaneous dishes & tupperware.
8348 2018-06-02 19:46:11 Saut shrimp & veggies in 1tbsp of coconut oil & serve over brown rice spaghetti. Delicious & easy 2 make in bulk.
8349 2018-06-02 19:45:39 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
8350 2018-06-02 19:45:18 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8351 2018-06-02 19:45:17 I’m glad that my nose ring got in the way of your free oil change so much that you had to complain to management about it :)))))
8352 2018-06-02 19:45:11 2 1/2 wait @Walmart for a oil change  I can’t !
8353 2018-06-02 19:45:03 Ask the oil companies where all these profits are going?? 
8354 2018-06-02 19:44:42 I put some deep muscle relief oil on my knees & calves. OMG, this stuff is amazing! 
8355 2018-06-02 19:44:20 Be careful when you rip them off I’ve always used coconut oil to take them off so it doesn’t rip my real lashes
8356 2018-06-02 19:44:09 ㌦円 本来はOILのような値動きをするはずだったのでは？
8357 2018-06-02 19:44:04 Almost had a hot oil incident, called granny for help and she just yelled “que pasa”, and did not budge. I now find her eating jello without a care.  cool...

8361 2018-06-02 19:43:30 @JusCallMe_Dee hey girl I wanna try some twists that I wear throughout the week. I was just curious like what products do I need? A custard, oil, or a cream? 
8362 2018-06-02 19:43:23 Spermaceti (which is the stuff you're on about), from which the whale derives its name, was a prime target of the whaling industry, and was sought after for use in oil lamps, lubricants, and candles.
8363 2018-06-02 19:43:16 The hits just keep coming in ST-4 as the #29 T's Concept 86 is being forced to stop with an oil cooler issue. #SuperTaikyu #Fuji24h

8366 2018-06-02 19:43:01 Put vitamin e oil on my face and I’m feeling so hydrated and dewy
8367 2018-06-02 19:42:58 Not true. The surge is due to a rise in global prices, not just a trend in India! 
And when oil was >$100/barrel, we were insulated by way of government subsidies. Why didn't anyone bat an eyelid then?

8371 2018-06-02 19:42:20 Watching a beer head of a man flex his masculinity at the oil change place to his wife but also yelling at her for things no one could do anything about is so nice. People in this world are nice and considerate to one another
8372 2018-06-02 19:42:17 Steam some broccoli and kale, douse in olive oil and salt salt salt. Great greasy salty healthy snack, you won't even notice it's a healthy vegetable.
8373 2018-06-02 19:42:10 Petrol price is influenced by global politics and has nothing to do with president,Sanction to Iran and the increase of oil is the cause of petrol increases,By December 1 Burrell will be close to $100 and Petrol will increase up to R18 a ltr
8374 2018-06-02 19:41:54 When will you end your expensive trips to your golf courses on our dollar, and your violations of the emoluments clause?  You are nothing but a snake oil salesman and a two-bit grifter.

8377 2018-06-02 19:41:32 Agree to disagree.
8378 2018-06-02 19:41:29 Basically no one wants to surprise a vendor when they have two vats of 350 degree oil 
8379 2018-06-02 19:41:06 Ya need turbo with ya base model self, syke nah but thas dope I recently purchase a bmw 328i and that car has been eating oil so imma possibly go back to Japanese so I can save a lil bit on deniro after it gets out da shoppp
8380 2018-06-02 19:41:03 I didn’t clean up the oil spills from the Exxon Valdez to have my kids tell me they don’t like a form of cheese on toast. What is this world coming to?
8381 2018-06-02 19:40:56 Exactly! while they take our precious primitive land in Southern Utah so they can profit from it and drill for oil and gas. Mother Nature is pissed!
8382 2018-06-02 19:40:54 The oil in this whole thing makes me want to throw up.
8383 2018-06-02 19:40:33 Have they been wrong? Or have they strategically created perpetual chaos for the sake of the 1% & Israel & Saudi Arabia? Land grab, oil, other resources, & implanting militant Islamists to convert most to radical Islam, less Muslims, Christians, etc, has always been their mission
8384 2018-06-02 19:40:27 That raw coconut oil good for the hair until you get ready to cuddle. Your girl end up with a pimple on her chin cause you trying to lay up while she play with your hair......
8385 2018-06-02 19:40:22 At the time fracking was the middle way toward renewables, half as dirty as oil/coal. We in NYC are better off with buses using natural gas, auto emissions regs. Our air is actually breathable now! I'm sure Hillary wanted to go fully green but knew impossible over night. SMDH
8386 2018-06-02 19:40:22 All that coconut oil
8387 2018-06-02 19:40:16 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
8388 2018-06-02 19:39:55 To much coconut oil
8389 2018-06-02 19:39:49 That's assuming people want those jobs. Not everyone wants to be a oil platform worker and not everyone wants to be a doctor either. You can't force people into professions they don't want.

8394 2018-06-02 19:39:09 Soft-core porn, meaning just rubbing and oil. I don’t consider it porn but I mean some people do.
8395 2018-06-02 19:39:08 One dynamo you should definitely add is the Creosote Oil Dynamo.  Consumes Creosote Oil in bottled or liquid form, good early game power source but produces a small amount of byproduct that has to be periodically removed or efficiency goes down fast. Recognizes most mod oil types
8396 2018-06-02 19:39:04 Only me and tom would think it was a good idea to use oil in 30 degree heat when everyone is using factor 50 and still burning. So we've been stuck in the room today with blisters  thank god for room service 
8397 2018-06-02 19:38:44 But in your own words IF they treat their staff like the article shows then the company is awful.  Also I did research lush today and found out that despite claims to being eco friendly they still use palm oil.
8398 2018-06-02 19:38:19 Our family is Aboriginal and is very involved in the Alberta oil patch. It’s very clear to me that you are uneducated as to the prosperity the Alberta oil patch has provided to all Canadians. It’s called progress and it’s in the National Interest of Canada. #KinderMorgan
8399 2018-06-02 19:38:13 This oil is the worst thing that has ever happened to me.
8400 2018-06-02 19:38:12 I think the Black Cumin Oil is the best way to get rid of Asthma.......
8401 2018-06-02 19:38:02 Tesla occupy a place as electric vehicle constructor but don't satisfy market and permit oil to stay pollution and big profits to oil companies, all is conspiration against public.

8407 2018-06-02 19:37:08 RT LoriShemek: When inflammatory oils high in omega 6 fat, such as vegetable, canola, sunflower and corn oil are cooked over high heat, they release toxic chemicals called aldehydes that have been linked to dementia, cancer, and heart disease.  #inflammation #cancer #dementi…
8408 2018-06-02 19:37:04 Can Black Cumin Oil be great for Asthma........
8409 2018-06-02 19:36:58 Hlawulani your analogy is wrong. Look at the oil price and zar vs usd in January. This is qn attack on SA like it was in Brazil só that SA tows the western countries line.  SA chose BRICS ànd is being forced out through this.  Ppl need to rise up like Brazil
8410 2018-06-02 19:36:52 In use beard balm might need to buy an oil now
8411 2018-06-02 19:36:48 I concur with ur idea. I think they are promoting restructuring. After all PMB have nothing to lose, he doesn't have oil.
8412 2018-06-02 19:36:45 Probably the oil was too hot ... or was it oil in those days 
8413 2018-06-02 19:36:36 It’s not me that demarcates them into sects it’s them- and there is definitely a fundamental ideology happening in all religions including Christianity. That is not to say that the worlds reliance on oil hasn’t caused the west to manipulate those divisions
8414 2018-06-02 19:36:35 Yeah and?? What does that prove? 

The fact that #KSA harnessed oil to be a top 20 economy in less than 50 years is a testimony to its success. Try again.

8432 2018-06-02 19:34:10 The leaves cause an oil like substance when crushed under the bogies and lubricate the track. SO it has to be done for safety reasons.

8435 2018-06-02 19:34:00 Yes, the oil riches e.i. Others pay for their wealth so they can spend money beyond what’s sane. The problem is that in rich countries wealth comes from finances not production(moved to poor ones) so Middle Class poorer.

8442 2018-06-02 19:33:26 I can think of a half dozen jobs that pay 6-figure salaries without requiring a college degree. And I agree college isn’t for everyone. Why should a guy that hates school turn down a $150k job in oil industry to get a degree from some crap school and then be a barista?
8443 2018-06-02 19:33:09 In 20 years the barrel of oil will be worthless.

8451 2018-06-02 19:32:07 japanese steakhouses are only good because of the presentation. Their food is the farthest thing from seasoned- seeing how they only use butter and oil to cook
8452 2018-06-02 19:32:01 “it’s my belief.”  THEN you accuse others.

Kindly start off by getting your own house in order. 

The SNP in Wipe1 predicted there would be £6.7 - 7.9bn in oil revenues - realised £100m.

Those in #bettertogether and elsewhere PREDICTED it was a lot of shite. 

Why was right ?
8453 2018-06-02 19:31:50 When a Christian enters politics they check God and their Christian principles at the door. The are like oil and water. Jimmy Carter was the only person, in my opinion, who managed it as well as he could under the circumstances. He never lost his Christian witness.
8454 2018-06-02 19:31:36 That was one stinky bag in a heatwave  spilt coffee. Olive oil. Bacon bits
8455 2018-06-02 19:31:25 Have you got an actifry? If not I highly recommend. On slimmers just point a drop of olive oil & you've got egg and chips!

8458 2018-06-02 19:31:15 Our oil? You’ll find it was the UKs oil. Investment on exploring and drilling wasn’t by Scotland either.

If you’re such a successful country then why do you rely on handouts from the Barnet formula?

Hope you get your wish. You’ll end up like oil rich Venezuela. Bust.

8464 2018-06-02 19:30:39 So fire fighter, law enforcement, oil field worker, sales, business owner, and all can make well over $100k not respectable?

8467 2018-06-02 19:30:23 He's right and you know it. It was a horrible resolution and you didn't even have the decency to abstain, in fear of angering your oil suppliers.
8468 2018-06-02 19:30:23 To my knowledge, none of the registered companies has the ability to do drilling. Correct me if Im wrong. Not to mention companies with the only qualification of being close to one political side. As for experts, of course we have many working in internatiknal oil companies.

8470 2018-06-02 19:29:59 Yes, less consumption, more production. Economists may not like it, but foreign countries aren’t necessarily trustworthy, so we can’t rely fully on a theory that has some unrealistic assumptions to begin with. Just remember the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973.

8476 2018-06-02 19:29:25 BJP /RSS meet.  Let's hope some urgent strategy would be worked out to provide  some  immediate relief in oil price & some  other  systematic  measures to woo farmers and  other  aggrieved  people  in view of the coming state elections followed by   election 2019 to win the same.

8478 2018-06-02 19:29:00 Yes the drive from skye accross the kyle of lochalsh was like one big oil painting.  Breathtaking.
8479 2018-06-02 19:28:50 Rosehip oil has saved my dry skin as well as Cerave cream and the Klairs toner 
8480 2018-06-02 19:28:45 Babe is giving me a foot oil treatment 
8481 2018-06-02 19:28:20 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
8482 2018-06-02 19:28:18 We are going to revoke all Oil Licenses in 2019, and ensure Host Communities own those Oil Blocs because they deserve it ~ PMB.

8485 2018-06-02 19:28:00 They Conspired With Oil Multi National Comp to steal Our Crude Oil, corner Oil Blocs, pollute the environment, failed to develop Oil Producing Communities, and deliberately refuse to clean up the environment after spillage. We are going to revoke all Oil Licenses in 2019 -  PMB
8486 2018-06-02 19:27:48 What about fuel why do we still depend on the damn Saudis to provide oil at high prices when we can extract hydrogen.
  Fuel is through the roof here in California. !!!
 #Hydrogen is the future
8487 2018-06-02 19:27:47 Atish Patel, if it gets any hotter I think we need to show the powers that be the profit potential of building close to an Alaskan oil field!
8488 2018-06-02 19:27:46 And WHY do you think that is David?
8489 2018-06-02 19:27:44 Desanimado eu fiquei no período do PT... hj temos valor e pespectiva ( oil tem preço/ operacional redondo)...Ainda não sabemos o grande gatilho que é político... O mercado observa o amanhã... Parente já era...Não compre apenas pensando em 3-5 meses...Ser estatal tem preço...
8490 2018-06-02 19:27:40 How must you have felt about canola oil?!
8491 2018-06-02 19:27:05 my cashapp is $cocaineblaze if anyone wants to put towards my oil change, lol.
8492 2018-06-02 19:27:04 No one with an ounce of education gets their news from Television. So your numbers make perfect sense. Himmler would be proud of your propaganda operation....those TV watchers are perfect for your snake oil 
8493 2018-06-02 19:26:53 How many of the 16 legal challenges cited were by BC Govn’t? As for ‘follow the law’, recall that @jjhorgan walked back on regulating the flow of oil unilaterally & instead referred the Q to the courts. Recall that #Notley applauded him and declared victory.
8494 2018-06-02 19:26:42 If I don’t find my jojoba oil im gonna have a bf
8495 2018-06-02 19:26:40 That's confusing. Wd-40 displaces traditional lubes, oil, grease. I wonder why they'd use it on that particular joint.
8496 2018-06-02 19:26:30 If he's so good with math, why would he spend tax dollars to complete a pipeline (to sell) that won't be of any value if China no longer needs Canadian oil.

Perhaps you should stop regurgitating what you hear and start paying attention to world issues.

8501 2018-06-02 19:26:03 Oil change, new spark plug wires, and new spark plugs done on the Stang hehe
8502 2018-06-02 19:25:59 Ditching the Iran deal has complicated matters hasn't it? Your party and president are fools to have backed out of the deal. Oil prices just one problem it's creating.
8503 2018-06-02 19:25:49 Trust me, you don't. Very shitty, chalky. Feels like glitter on your face, but it doesn't even look good. Stinks, like canola oil. Don't waste your money. Please 
8504 2018-06-02 19:25:18 My dry shampoo ran out so I’m looking like a bottle of cooking oil :(
8505 2018-06-02 19:24:56 if you’re still having problems, you might have to mix in an oil with the foundation. but tbh as a fellow dry skinned girl, you should always stray away from super matte foundations
8506 2018-06-02 19:24:52 Genie oil their board of directors and why Israel is allowed to give them the right to Syrian land for oil exploration
8507 2018-06-02 19:24:52 Pretty soon, the swamp will be producing crude oil.  It’s being filled with enough dirty people that it’s only a matter of time.
8508 2018-06-02 19:24:40 It's crap. Just like a lot of jobs some companies good, some not. I make well over 100 grand. Don't work for bad operators, they dissapear
8509 2018-06-02 19:24:39 They are all in with this snake oil salesmen served them right.  The titanic is taking on water and @MichaelAvenatti is playing the music.  #bastamyazz

8514 2018-06-02 19:23:20 Genie oil and their board of directors and why
8515 2018-06-02 19:23:20 coconut oil is my everything, i swear.
8516 2018-06-02 19:23:07 I put tea tree oil on my scalp the night before wash day.  I ALWAYS use leave in conditioner.  Heat doesn’t come near my head unless I’m prepping to have my hair braided or I go to the salon and she does something special.
8517 2018-06-02 19:22:50 Jesus... I remember hearing about the property boom in Brazil for years. Everything was positive in the media until the world cup. Do oil reserves not float these countries well?
8518 2018-06-02 19:22:48 This is being politicised unnecessarily...it's the CM's prerogative and personal decision...this can stop now!
Better control and reduce oil price ...
8519 2018-06-02 19:22:44 Nissan, Volkswagen parts and maintenance is expensive. Oil change for Volkswagen is $100
8520 2018-06-02 19:22:42 Co-co-nut oil
8521 2018-06-02 19:22:34 I swear by cleansers/toners rather than make up wipes or micellar water as they’re more natural and don’t have hidden chemicals. Salt water is good because it can balance oil 
8522 2018-06-02 19:22:31 Question for the men and women with fades: what do y’all put on your hair to moisturize it? This coconut oil isn’t working.

8526 2018-06-02 19:21:35 The truth is hard. We're trying to create lots of new great-paying oil jobs that the climate  just can't afford.

Trudeau's climate and economy platitude gets in the way of discussing that.
8527 2018-06-02 19:21:34 Use Wild Growth Oil, I massaged it in my scalp every other day and my hair has grown sooooo much
8528 2018-06-02 19:21:32 どのようなレベルか分からないけどちょっと分かる
8529 2018-06-02 19:21:18 I depart Monday, thanks for the oil and salt reminder. Nappies, wipes, bottles etc. had blinded me.
8530 2018-06-02 19:20:42 first look at your oil deal, people all around the world will get a heavy shock.
8531 2018-06-02 19:20:34 Damn I just had a customer throw a hissy fit over me being on break and not selling her an oil burner 
8532 2018-06-02 19:20:32 Almost time for Golden Oil to be here for Vendor Day! 1-5pm. 15% off all Golden Product, and free battery with purchase of Golden Cart!!!
8533 2018-06-02 19:20:29 Yes, and Europe will be deforested and oil reserves have peaked and we all gonna die.
8534 2018-06-02 19:20:23 Sure., but that is not what the pot crowd cares about. Nor are the products really intended for that. They use that as a facade. The ultimate goal is recreational use. So is CBD oil. It's just a step they are taking to achieve the ultimate goal.
8535 2018-06-02 19:20:12 That might not work well — CBD actually needs a small amount of THC to work properly. A lot of CBD out there is just charlatan oil.  :-/

8541 2018-06-02 19:19:36 Eucalyptus and peppermint is the best mix for an essential oil diffuser.
8542 2018-06-02 19:19:34 Ah, but oil... and RU.
8543 2018-06-02 19:19:29 False alarm everyone! The two lines on the test turned out to be just oil stains. Also, my friend says he's onto you, @meanestklingon - scouring the twitterverse for a robot baby? You're not the first one, pal.
8544 2018-06-02 19:19:24 I just had the worst nuggets from Chic-Fil-A. I never go there based on moral principle, but everybody raves about it so I tried it. The website says 12g if fat in an 8 piece. I call bullshit; they were dripping with oil and grease.

8549 2018-06-02 19:18:41 My lawnmower died today. He was tough old bird... I tried starting the old guy for the 2nd half of the yard and look like a blood vessel had been broken. Oil was shooting out of the side of it. #RIPOG

8552 2018-06-02 19:17:48 Any chance that the PC’s spending like drunken sailors, and not saving any cash during the oil boom bear any responsibility
8553 2018-06-02 19:17:44 Been taking fermented Skate fish liver oil capsules for 3 months...The difference in my awareness is staggering. Also cut out refined sugar use natural if you must. Coconut oil use it! Same with organic honey and garlic...guarantee you results..

8559 2018-06-02 19:17:13 You got to remember all the oil that they produce doesn't just go here it goes to every country in the world that buys oil so we got 3.5 billion people in the United States you're looking at minimum of 7 billion cars 930 motorcycles boats and tractor trailer trucks

8567 2018-06-02 19:16:32 So Canada should charge more for oil exported to the U.S. Thanks for the tip.
8568 2018-06-02 19:16:29 Your making a joke right?
8569 2018-06-02 19:16:13 In any type of work in the oil field, you come to realize 40 hours is part time 
8570 2018-06-02 19:16:10 I thought I needed to rush and find someone to love when all i needed was some coconut oil
8571 2018-06-02 19:16:03 They charge what the market will bear but they also have to cover their costs buying it from the manufacturer shipping refinement and shipping in from the refineries. Because of the Uproar of refineries in this country sometimes they have to shipped refined gas not crude oil

8575 2018-06-02 19:15:38 There’s a catalyst on allot of things like oil will hit a point that the government and companies will slow the supply and the price and demand will rocket up. Future cars will be electric or even nuclear powered. When we hit a point where even the planet it self
8576 2018-06-02 19:15:35 it's amazing how enjoyable it is to exist when your room isn't filled with emotional smog
8577 2018-06-02 19:15:32 The thing about oil though.
Once it gets infused with a scent, you cannot get rid of it either.
8578 2018-06-02 19:15:25 The oil I’m getting off of my face is literally black from sitting on the sidewalk in Pittsburgh welcome to the city everyone
8579 2018-06-02 19:15:23 The syrup is SO good in gin & tonic. Like. SO GOOD. And the oil is a new one for me but can be used for dipping bread or in a focaccia recipe I have... also for an aioli but we all know my thoughts on mayo lol
8580 2018-06-02 19:15:20 Oh be quiet! I want hear about the unrealized potential of green energy infrastructure on the Canadian economy. So long as Canada allows Big Oil & the #MilitaryIndustrialComplex to suck all the oxygen in the room, what should be a priority, stays unrealized!
8581 2018-06-02 19:15:19 Oil spillage
8582 2018-06-02 19:15:19 Then I hit it with some oil and put my new silky Durag on

8584 2018-06-02 19:15:03 If I have not had fish oil in the morn, I swear more than a sailor and a stevedore.
8585 2018-06-02 19:14:52 And no oil does not belong to every human being on Earth it is a commodity like everything else the people that buy the mineral rights or in this case the government they pump it out of the ground they are the owner kinda like how you own a car
8586 2018-06-02 19:14:50 Minutes ago, Jason Chaffetz allowed oil drilling in the cast of Hamilton while you were distracted by Trump's tweets. Bad!

8588 2018-06-02 19:13:36 He said in the Middle East their government is not like our government some places still have kings that have absolute control so they may actually have control of the oil wells either the king or the government so it works a lot different than it does here.

8598 2018-06-02 19:13:05 "Think" is not a risk the Oilers franchise can take this year.  Stand pat, with ok goalies, they make playoffs & continue on way.  Lose RNH to a pick that doesn't blow doors off immediately (which 25/55 is for rookie) & Oil don't make playoffs & remain in tailspin.
8599 2018-06-02 19:13:02 Feed my ducks with oil? Are you stupid?? #koulzbot
8600 2018-06-02 19:13:02 It can still happen with the weather change and humidity in the air.  Maybe you are allergic to the detergent. Try the coconut oil either way. Don’t get the processes kind
8601 2018-06-02 19:12:48 So I dyed my hair in the winter and people say for a hair mask buy coconut oil and put it in your hair so I did that put it was hard so I heated it up with a blow dryer. Since then I use it on my lips when they are chapped and also on my eye because my eyes get flakey and dry
8602 2018-06-02 19:12:40 Oil is actually renewable.
8603 2018-06-02 19:12:39 Argan or jojoba oil! Also derma-e has a hydration mist with hyaluronic acid in it that changed my life
8604 2018-06-02 19:12:36 westminster has had access to all our resources for 300 years and all they did was waste them, they've had near 50 years of oil revenue and what did they do with it? war after war, used it under thatcher to offset mass unemployment, then more wars under blair etc. time for us now
8605 2018-06-02 19:12:29 Plus, there is nothing green or clean about solar panels. If we somehow replaced the energy oil provides us with panels, the damage to the Earth would be incalculable.
8606 2018-06-02 19:12:23 I'm thinking it's Saudi behind much of it ... apart from.the Political stance there's oil & money....
8607 2018-06-02 19:12:19 The secret to MY rice is that I use 1 part rice and 1 part unsweetened shredded coconut. I saute onions & spices in grape seed oil and add shrimp, then add the rice. It's really delicious.
8608 2018-06-02 19:12:18 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.

8615 2018-06-02 19:11:42 How about the millions of liters of diesel released by ships yearly, when they get rid of ballast water? Or the pollution of gasoline/oil around marinas? Plastics are just part of the problem!

8618 2018-06-02 19:11:25 Chris how it good business sense includes slapping tariffs on everything we use to build stuff, driving up the price of real estate. Or how it’s good business to sanction Iran, driving up oil prices. Here’s the business sense in using our tax man bet to prop up

8620 2018-06-02 19:11:08 I had a coconut oil packet next to a wad of cash and when it got hot the packet melted and now the cash looks see through and @Chase can’t figure out its real money... uhhh duh
8621 2018-06-02 19:11:03 Change own oil and brakes, keep car clean like dad taught, save a lot on maintenance. Grandpa Mike was a mechanic after retiring US Army, got nicknamed "Honest Mike" because a Wichita reporter broke down near Chapman. His rate and work was amazing. I'm very proud of my family. :)

8634 2018-06-02 19:08:42 It's not going to be easy by any means but those who say oil demand growth is inevitable should be honest about what that means for the climate. 

Happy to look at those models but since we are just 20 years from passing 2C, we have to slash all carbon sources
8635 2018-06-02 19:08:41 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
8636 2018-06-02 19:08:37 I dont trust anyone who doesnt use shampoo. Are you afraid of stripping oils? Use less!! What is the logic? Body oil magically cleans hair? No? Then what?
8637 2018-06-02 19:08:03 @MarkJaccard I am puzzled by the projections of continual demand for our oil, since it seems at odds with the global desire to shift away from FF. Do these projections have high uncertainty? Is it the self-assurance of tobacco companies before the collapse of cigarette smoking?

8648 2018-06-02 19:06:22 If you honestly believe that we have not had a way to do away with fossil fuels for ages you are an idiot. But the major oil producers would go broke and the petro dollar would cease to exist. Senator school must not be that difficult...

8659 2018-06-02 19:04:37 Korrek. Tina Jou Ma se Petterson approved the sale within 24hrs of it being presented to her - although oil was trading at $52 at the time. And once scrutiny started in 2016 she maintained, for months, that it was a 'stock rotation'- later proved to be a lie.

8684 2018-06-02 19:00:44 Why do people share personal things with me? Like I’m just here to get my oil changed bro.
8685 2018-06-02 19:00:37 Plant based, rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, nuts/seeds, olive oil; limited in dairy and fish, and very small amounts of meats (mostly used as garnish).
8686 2018-06-02 19:00:34 Clark's pt about oil is spot on.  Russia is in Syria for exactly that.

Years ago, I read that Churchill drew the ME "new" nations' boundary lines to purposely include infighting factions and thus create "weak" states: UK wanted easier control of ME ... to get the oil. (fucker)
8687 2018-06-02 19:00:28 Oil is the obvious one, but without knowing which small country how can i give you an answer? How about you tell me how staying as part of UK will improve the lives of ppl in Scotland?

8689 2018-06-02 19:00:24 newspapers that if the fires were left to burn over a period of several months, enough smoke from the 600 or so 1991 Kuwaiti oil fires "might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of South Asia ..." and that this possibility should "affect the war plans";[61][62]

8698 2018-06-02 18:59:25 This is as dishonest as the oil forecast in the white paper

8700 2018-06-02 18:59:18 Eggs and vegetable oil mixed together. Check your cupboard you already have the ingredients . You should add free cooking classes to the list of demands!
8701 2018-06-02 18:59:10 Yes oil revenue of any kind is bad.......and nobody said rely on it?  To supplement is more appropriate.

8709 2018-06-02 18:57:54 I’m not even lying, I was the only owner of my 2007 Elantra and the only maintenance needed was just routine (tires, oil, etc) when I sold it, it still had the factory belts and everything. It lasted me a solid 10 years.
8710 2018-06-02 18:57:53 You could pretreat with a neem oil and dish soap mix. Other than that just keep an eye on the plants.

Oil exec #1: Well, let’s go then. Always wanted to see Rome…
8714 2018-06-02 18:56:42 There is this thing call “Technology” that creates jobs and makes other jobs obsolete. There are also shifts in market demand for good and services.. when was the last time you seen a milkman, or a full service gas station that checks your oil?
8715 2018-06-02 18:56:36 Salmon oil pal...
8716 2018-06-02 18:56:34 Is that like the British nationalists that think they should keep all the oil money in the UK? I didn’t see Westminster offering to share it with anyone, did you? As I recall the money was spent destroying Scotland’s industrial base and making Londoners rich.
8717 2018-06-02 18:56:26 Gift by @narendramodi led @BJP4India Govt. to the people of country on losing Karnataka and By poll Lok Sabha and Assembly election.... Price of Cylinder Gas increased by Rs 48 and Petrol and Desiel oil is touching sky despite low price of crude oil in international market.

8719 2018-06-02 18:56:09 I took my car for its first oil change today.. when they showed me that bill I damn near threw up in my mouth. 

I want my Nissan back. 
I want my $18 oil changes back. 
$80 is tew damn much man. 
Nobody told me life would be like this before I got the car 
8720 2018-06-02 18:56:05 Nice... 
8721 2018-06-02 18:55:56 Trump will be ordering grid operators to buy electricity from coal and  nuclear plants. Does that sound like limited govt to you?? Even the oil  industry condemns that unprecedented intervention in the free market.   Everything the GOP claimed to stand for was a lie.  #MN02
8722 2018-06-02 18:55:38 Anyone have a good read on uncertainties/challenges of doing CCS by way of EOR type strategies? On surface seems like oil production cancels out capture.

8726 2018-06-02 18:55:19 @WhitlockJason in TX, in ranching/hunting, oil/gas & real estate businesses we need welders, fitters, HVAC, plumbers, drivers. No college req’d and most make around $100k or better. Problem is snowflakes don’t have grit and push.

8728 2018-06-02 18:55:00 ensure that Canadian oil can be shipped to Asian markets, to reduce reliance on the U.S. market. He's also an amateur boxer. Eat your KFC, Trumpie.
8729 2018-06-02 18:55:00 I agree that we should be looking for ways to reduce DEMAND. But until then, why would support attacking Canadian SUPPLY? The world wants our oil along with our best in class environmental & social standards. Ontario trucks run on Saudi refined oil.
8730 2018-06-02 18:54:56 Our oil money kept you lot afloat. Why else would you be so keen to keep us in the Union. Have a nice one in your post Brexit little England isolation
8731 2018-06-02 18:54:44 I doubt anyone will want the responsibility besides Libyan players shall probably call it an infringement on a sovereignty that doesn't exist. Only the US can successfuly undertake such a  role but I dont see it happening under Trump unless we assign 1/2 Libyan oil to him
8732 2018-06-02 18:54:39 Because he is serving an economic purpose for donors through the dismantling of his agency and the advocating for the needs of coal and oil companies.
8733 2018-06-02 18:54:28 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!

8735 2018-06-02 18:54:00 Sounds good to me.

Except for this pipeline the only tax dollars spent on oil and gas is a credit for exploration and an accelerated assest depreciation. 

The industry gives those up and the rest of Canada agrees to exclude resource revenue from equalization.
8736 2018-06-02 18:53:59 I forgot to put cooking oil before making eggs... fuk
8737 2018-06-02 18:53:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
8738 2018-06-02 18:53:56 That will struggle. Different cooking methods required there, at least prior to finishing. Your mushrooms need steam to start them & good seasoning, then lowered & garlic, butter to finish spring onions will burn & the toms need herbs & olive oil 
8739 2018-06-02 18:53:54 21:53 You drill oil in Turkana then transport them via road to Mombasa. Some things doesn't add up at all. via @EldonLangat
8740 2018-06-02 18:53:46 It’s that math based on the @CPC_HQs sale of GM stocks to balance their budget? The track record has been pretty good when you look at other oil resource projects.
8741 2018-06-02 18:53:42 Its brilliant. Super easy and no nasty lingering smell. I use the oil. I just made the mistake of doing mine then going straight to bed. I have gradual mousse too but yet to try. They also do a face range which is brill 
8742 2018-06-02 18:53:13 In 8 years, the government has “tested” with solar energy generation and has gotten nearly nowhere in terms of being self-sustainable. 
All because oil tax is still attractive?

8745 2018-06-02 18:52:53 @kristenaiken Donuts are deep fried in pure oil. Oil has 9 calories per gram. Sugar has 4 calories per gram.

I’d walk on the floors and tell PEOPLE, to come talk to me, BEFORE committing to a car, to see what the financial upkeep is. Niggas don’t listen, never came.

8753 2018-06-02 18:51:31 Only because I’m not convinced Alaska is done producing oil that will be shipped to the Salish Sea.
8754 2018-06-02 18:51:18 Good, we can use our own oil, quit making middle Easterners rich and quit protecting oil rich countries..
8755 2018-06-02 18:50:56 @RobRains Luke Weaver definitely has a discoloration on his cap that he keeps going to with his fingers. Not saying it's anything. Could be after using the hat many times the oil from his fingers is attracting dirt, but I would point it out if I were a Pirates player for sure.
8756 2018-06-02 18:50:51 We were already poised to over take  all of OPEC in production in the course of the next two years......we no longer need any of our trading partners oil which is one of the things they NEED to sell us....Now who carries the big stick? That's right...the USA
8757 2018-06-02 18:50:42 The Iraq war was not for oil. This is a common leftist talking point. It was for Israeli interests & its national security. If it was for oil, its because Israel wanted it to steal Iraqi oil for itself. 70% of Israel's oil imports came from the Kurdish region in northern Iraq.
8758 2018-06-02 18:50:25 Reportagens assinadas por pessoas que desconhecem completamente o segmento de Oil&Gás e que sequer se preocupa em ouvir os especialistas do setor, trata-se de um desserviço ao país. Aos leitores da Folha, nem falo mais nada
8759 2018-06-02 18:50:10 Just got a discount for an oil change by simply sharing my Popeyes with the mechanic. Won’t he do it 
8760 2018-06-02 18:49:59 Is she the one that owned stock in Trojan??
8761 2018-06-02 18:49:59 *goes in for regluh ass $40 oil change* 

“Actually, ma’am, you need 4 new tires, a new engine, water hose, battery, a new liver. Total: $7000”
8762 2018-06-02 18:49:57 I was due for an oil change about 3000 miles ago but still haven’t gotten one. Is my car gonna be.... okay?
8763 2018-06-02 18:49:56 Do you ever use plastic straws? Plastic toothbrushes? Disposable razors? Do you consume palm oil? Eat at all you can eat buffets that have meat/dairy products available?
8764 2018-06-02 18:49:52 Oil
8765 2018-06-02 18:49:40 Mathis Brothers easy.  If you’ve continued to sell furniture through 2 oil busts and a continued... rodent rumor... you can handle yourself
8766 2018-06-02 18:49:39 I nearly poured water inside my oil tank and @ba55ey saved the day.I call  for help or I take my car to dealership so they can Put oil/water/coolant in my car.I am car useless.This is a man role. (No devil worshipper should say anything about gender role or female mechanics)
8767 2018-06-02 18:49:22 @fordnation Hi Mr Ford.  Recently heard about a massive chromium deposit in northern ontario. Its dunbed the "ring of fire".

Are there any plans to begin tappimg into "Ontario's Oil sands"?

Could be MASSIVE!

;) ;)  

Cheers!
8768 2018-06-02 18:49:10 I used an entire jar of coconut oil and broke two nit combs last time  I can't take it any more.
8769 2018-06-02 18:49:04 Banks just don't grow. Like autos. And my dumbass dabbled in oil again, that never works out for me, already battling contango, and like I know global supply and demand or time COT reports.

8773 2018-06-02 18:48:45 If DT is Putin's puppet, answer me this;
Why did DT push through such a high Mil spending package?
Why did DT open up ANWR?
Why deregulate Oil/Gas regs?
Syrian actions certainly not pro-Russian.
All this "Trump is a traitor, beholden to Russia" is BS.
8774 2018-06-02 18:48:37 Not only Jamaica, also Guyana. Alberta has a slush fund from oil and gas revenue. I shudder to think how Guyana will manage any oil and gas revenue

8780 2018-06-02 18:48:05 It was RFK who pissed off the Mob after old man Kennedy got their support in WVA., elsewhere, for JFK. Bobby kept going after them. FBI, CIA, Johnson, Tx. Oil $’s-all involved.
8781 2018-06-02 18:47:51 Luke Weaver definitely has a discoloration on his cap that he keeps going to with his fingers. Not saying it's anything. Could be after using the hat many times the oil from his fingers is attracting dirt, but I would point it out if I were a Pirates player for sure. #STLCards
8782 2018-06-02 18:47:39 Hard to say. Crime needs to be covered, but media tend to pay too much attention to violence. Especially during terrorist attacks. This might play a role as well. Some people like adding oil in fire.

8792 2018-06-02 18:45:38 Good grief. In states whose economies rely heavily on the oil or coal industry, not having a relationship with your state’s business leaders would be odd. Stop trying to make it into something it’s not.
8793 2018-06-02 18:45:36 AUN’s world-class education and state-of-the-art facilities in addition to being Africa’s first development university gave it the right to be called Africa’s best uni.

8798 2018-06-02 18:44:54 I don't think the lights are on. He's trying to use an oil lantern like the olden days. Because there's so much empty space in his head where a brain would normally be, the air flow puts it out.
8799 2018-06-02 18:44:48 Actually he backtracked on that. He planned to re-nationalise the oil in 2010. 

He did say something about giving people the oil revenues directly but that never transpired and was likely just propaganda
8800 2018-06-02 18:44:41 I do a wash every two weeks so I guess you would say twice a month or when it gets really dirty and okay that’s good to know cause I’m just getting into the co wash I always did an oil treatment.

8802 2018-06-02 18:44:39 This should not be simply about the Orcas.... their demise is the diminishing food source and being harassed by commercial Whale Watch boats. The reason to oppose the pipeline expansion is because of the dirty oil sands extraction process. Canada is not green but an oily mess!
8803 2018-06-02 18:44:34 Kenya is an oil producing and exporting country but we still importing petroleum products and our fuel prices are 'astounding'

1. Mix some neosporian, coconut oil, and olive. Apply it to your stretch marks every night before going to bed. They should be gone in 2 weeks.  

2. Exfoliate daily with almond oil, sugar and lemon juice before you have a shower.

8809 2018-06-02 18:43:34 Use a potato peeler and a deep fryer. The potato peeler will slice them at the right thickness. Just remember you can drop them as fast as you can in the oil. Just not all at once. You gotta put in one at a time like dealing cards
8810 2018-06-02 18:43:33 There is no Ab- ezam zam. And not even oil rich. So we are poor people who even don't know water is most important and for this trees are much more important.
8811 2018-06-02 18:43:31 so if i intake thc in different ways like vape vs oil vs eating vs smoking it does it compound highs in different ways or it is like just stacking on top of the original high?
8812 2018-06-02 18:43:30 Stability in the Middle East is the primary factor for the oil market.  As much as this author would like you to believe, the US market, even at its highest production does not have a huge impact on prices.

8820 2018-06-02 18:42:47 The LCO (Liquid, cream, oil) method works really well for me (during the summer I don't use moisturizing creams as much). I love the "gel" type leave-ins too. And then I like olive, jojoba and black castor oil a lot.

8822 2018-06-02 18:42:33 I am sorry that caring about the climate impacts your job. But #climatechange is accelerating and the world HAS to transition away from oil or we all perish. There are currently more jobs in renewables than oil, gas and coal combined. It’s time to retrain.

8824 2018-06-02 18:42:06 How many countries have we taken advantage of?  Over threw the democraticly elected gov of Iran in the 50s to install a dictator for oil, propped up south American doctors for the vegetable and fruit companies.

8832 2018-06-02 18:41:17 as a reserve I'd think favoured generators would be oil. Engineers would know better than I the lowest cost plant under very low capacity factors.
Baseload plants would be the worst - which is why I find any use of the term "reserve" with the proposal cringeworthy.
8833 2018-06-02 18:41:17 It is the same for pets! At least the don’t try to give people the same vaccines every year for the rest of their lives!  One third of all dogs have cancer and this is one of the reasons.  CBD oil is working very well for pets.

8846 2018-06-02 18:39:53 I guess once you spritz it, the oil creates some type of film on the surface of the water I’m guessing that’s what traps the odor!!
8847 2018-06-02 18:39:37 The global demand (need) for oil will remain for many years, albeit slowly reducing. If not our oil, someone else’s. Alberta needs access to global markets to benefit from global prices.  Thus the need for the pipeline.

8857 2018-06-02 18:38:32 I would also point out that Trumpian foreign policy has sufficiently destabilized the Middle East to put upward pressure on oil, erasing any wage gains with increases at the gas pump. We are almost back to gas at $3/gallon.

8861 2018-06-02 18:37:57 on the other hand, protectionist executive orders that favor specific countries and oil companies, combined with stagnation of renewable energy initiatives probably do have a significant cumulative effect.

8873 2018-06-02 18:36:44 Those cars, driven by people.  Those people, created by parents enticed by cheap energy and oil.  That oil created a population growth of at least 4B more than would have without.  So, with every EV, include lots of condoms to quell the future growth when oil runs out.

It’s funny because a majority of African countries have their main exports as oil and gas and not gold.

Where people get this idea that gold would save the continent is baffling to say the least.
8881 2018-06-02 18:35:59 @phil_goff Annoyed my gas will cost more!We get taxed to death now you want to tax BNB's! Competition should drive prices down.Charge the oil companies 11.1 cents a litre!I use trains 3days a week because traffic is bad.Yes we need to pay for infrastructure.

8883 2018-06-02 18:35:15 He would have to canonize any oil company that came up with such a miracle. Maybe make the CEO the next pope.
8884 2018-06-02 18:35:12 Some things truly are coincidences. I don't think Trump has had much to do with oil prices. If anything, his push for U.S. to export more oil might have relieved some pressure (though it hasn't, as can be seen from the widening Brent/WTI spread).

8896 2018-06-02 18:33:48 There's a shift happening for sure. Kochs are spending money on some Democrat candidates. I think the Kochs and his oil & gas buddies have grown tired of Trump's antics, and another one of those political shifts is in the making.
8897 2018-06-02 18:33:48 lol! It’s that just your feelings or do you have facts?

8898 2018-06-02 18:33:39 I can imagine some very confusing conversations going into your average Sony dealer and trying to buy Sony oil...
8899 2018-06-02 18:33:27 Every year government has to pay interest of 5lac crore due to loans taken by congress. Government needs to collect tax otherwise it wont be able fund government. If they reduced tax on oil they wuf have to borrow more for running govt and in future interest outgo wud be more
8900 2018-06-02 18:33:25 Morrisons are committed to the responsible sourcing of Palm Oil and also looks to use supply chain systems which minimise the environmental impact associated with the production of key commodities. 1/2 - Marya
8901 2018-06-02 18:33:13 At the car wash finally. I haven’t washed my car since I bought it, other than the free wash at the dealer when I get an oil change 
8902 2018-06-02 18:33:10 Done swiped the oil on my shirt
8903 2018-06-02 18:33:01 Mineral oil should dissolve the glue and free the the bird from his sticky situation
8904 2018-06-02 18:33:00 Just thought I should mention I stopped using store bought deodorant. Started using coconut oil and lavender and I honestly feel so much better 
8905 2018-06-02 18:32:58 There were other options. Walker played right into sorry GOP legislature hands by heisting the PFDs rather than forcing the issue on oil companies or income taxes. Will Walker veto budget for Knik Arm bridge? For road north of Juneau (Juneau non-access)?
8906 2018-06-02 18:32:58 1/Pay attention? Perhaps I should ask you to do the same, sir. The non-oil sands crude is light sweet shale oil, which doesn't compete against oil sands heavy. You know that, right?
8907 2018-06-02 18:32:55 Big Oil. $3 a gallon is nothing if you live in the Bay Area we're looking at 4 dollars a gallon right now. And if Trump really want it to help Americans lower gas prices he would do what Bill Clinton did release strategic oil Reserves to push down World prices.

8909 2018-06-02 18:32:36 I don’t like them either. No fan of stodgy foods generally, but have always ascribed my revulsion to my origin in a South coast resort where the smell of them frying in slightly stale cotton seed oil swamped the smells of the sea and the candy floss

8913 2018-06-02 18:32:15 Oil sand are not 'lucrative' to Canada, they're really a drain on the economy, as it's sold at bargain basement prices and is forever being propped up by billions of taxpayers dollars! Those dollars should be better spent on healthcare, infrastructure, schools, green tech!
8914 2018-06-02 18:32:14 Yeah, pissing off your oldest trading partner and ally, not to mention your largest supplier of foreign oil certainly makes sense. Canada is going to match tariffs dollar for dollar. We'll be just fine trading with the rest of the world.
8915 2018-06-02 18:32:07 Kalamazoo, still not completely cleaned. Remember Valdez, decades later, still not cleaned. Are we concerned? We should be. More, or as least as, concerning to the planet is the expansion of the oil sands. Ever see aerials?

8929 2018-06-02 18:30:40 I just find it difficult to believe that the underinvestment started to put pressure on oil prices around the same time that the world started to realize Trump wasn’t going to moderate at all
8930 2018-06-02 18:30:35 I thought UEP is United Estate Plantations when they had palm oil plantations. Properties come after Sime started the development later.

8941 2018-06-02 18:29:45 Those are the fault of the oil corporations, though. It’s not our government’s fault that the industry slowed down. The jobs aren’t going to come back to like they were 10 years ago.

8945 2018-06-02 18:29:09 I once saw him referred to as Jordan Patreon.
Made me giggle because he's a huckster of the original type.
(Not saying patreon is bad, or just for frauds, but if you're selling snake oil, it's good to have an easy transaction system to use.)
8946 2018-06-02 18:28:55 Which slowed down the flow of oil so the Saudis can charge more. And why during the Obama Administration did gas prices go down even though they were stopping the flow of shale oil. And fracking explain that. You can't can you without telling the truth.

8955 2018-06-02 18:28:17 I think the point is that the world is more complex than people think. 

Saudi Arabia is a backwards theocracy but it's still supported by the West because of its oil.

8957 2018-06-02 18:27:53 Another puff piece by the @latimes about #BigOil's Governor in Sacramento, #JerryBrown. How can he be a "climate leader" when his administration approved 12,000 oil wells, including 238 NEW offshore wells? When will the @latimes tell the truth about Brown? #BrownsLastChance #MPAs
8958 2018-06-02 18:27:52 Most of the shock was for how people could vote for something so obviously self-destructive, based on tissue thin lies (such as the EU being undemocratic) and snake oil promises. The only thing it demonstrated was the parochial xenophobia of around 25% of the population
8959 2018-06-02 18:27:48 We can do any of our meals with no carbs & add coco oil. :) I would get Rosemary Garlic Chicken with all Veggies :)  Yummm - LR

8961 2018-06-02 18:27:38 Cold spoons from the freezer work well and a very tiny dab of orange concealer (I mix with a little coconut oil)
8962 2018-06-02 18:27:36 Canada won’t stop selling us 99% of their oil exports. Obama could have ended the war. Why didn’t he? Not a GOP war. Tax cuts for everyone, not just the rich. Right about one thing- the Korean War ant going to end based on that envelope alone. It is another piece of the puzzle.
8963 2018-06-02 18:27:36 I think it had a lot more to do with underinvestment in high fixed cost projects beginning to bite, despite resurgence in US shale output, in the face of fairly steady global oil demand growth.
8964 2018-06-02 18:27:26 Turns out that the CostCo brand Nutella is free of palm oil. My scale is now crying for mercy.
8965 2018-06-02 18:27:22 But I'm working for an oil company...
8966 2018-06-02 18:27:20 I was looking for your Thai infused oil. Couldn't find it in a couple of shops. Where can I buy?
8967 2018-06-02 18:27:16 I would love the oil bc my body aches and I can’t take NSAIDs due to my kidney function being poor. @LuckyLuciousP what ya think bro? I should win right?
8968 2018-06-02 18:27:16 I think these gold standard people live in la-la land. 

Imagine Nigeria with a gold standard when its economy is based on oil? 

Our debt based economies are ridiculous but he gold standard will create even worse booms and busts.
8969 2018-06-02 18:27:14 Is it not a utility like water like Electric  And natural gas the government does regulate that Then they're pumping oil which belongs to every human being on this Earth may well companies don't on the property or the oil

8976 2018-06-02 18:26:47 Not surprising this US wannabe Republicanism sprung out of Alberta. Ever since oil was discovered we've just been a US colony, sold out by our own politicians.
8977 2018-06-02 18:26:45 Crude oil price in 2004 : $37
Crude oil price in 2014 : $114
Crude oil price in 2018 : $72
8978 2018-06-02 18:26:34 Are you being deliberately obtuse? 300K barrels a day flow through the existing line to Burnaby. Oil, gas, jet fuel and other refined products. Once again the US reliance is only 20% of the total. A drop in the hat.
8979 2018-06-02 18:26:19 Remember Maisel did a photoshoot at the shore affected by the oil spill?  Well he was banned for few months from Conde Nast for that, because  investors was upset and was told that Vogue ids for selling clothes, not  political statements. So Teen Vogue is just boosting sales.
8980 2018-06-02 18:26:03 Two things brother - 1) the fuel price is regulated by the department of energy 2) Secunda's fuel is from coal, but Natref is traditional crude oil refinery.

8988 2018-06-02 18:25:24 Sorta on the same topic..

8996 2018-06-02 18:24:40 @JustinTrudeau should start by ending the funding and support for one of the dirtiest #fossilfuels in the world- the #tarsands. By pumping this dirty #oil out of #Canada & into air- he furthers the impacts of #climatechange which causes the #ocean acidification & #coral bleaching
8997 2018-06-02 18:24:26 We will still have to rely on foreign oil. The pipeline is not for moving oil. It is for moving diluted bitumen, which will be refined elsewhere and sold by someone else as oil. Why don’t you lobby for a refinery to be built in Alberta, and then start talking about Canadian oil?

9010 2018-06-02 18:22:25 Who funded the Oloibiri oil exploration and production? Aside revenue sharing back then, what other participatory role of further investments, etc were assigned to State govts (producing $ non producing)
9011 2018-06-02 18:22:22 That's a macroeconomic problem. The price crude oil drives the price of petrol.

9013 2018-06-02 18:22:12 I think Forecast for 2018 is a profit of around $20 mill & about sales of $160 mill. There is expenditure of the drilling but this will increase reserves. Most forecast were done with lower oil prices so could even outperform.

9028 2018-06-02 18:20:16 BUT OLIVE OIL no
9029 2018-06-02 18:20:14 Were any State governments part of the arrangements in 1958 for the exploration and production of crude oil, or was it a Federal Government affair 100%
9030 2018-06-02 18:19:57 Oil change got my car driving like a race car lol
9031 2018-06-02 18:19:42 This is the classic snake oil sales play. You get on their level. You be relatable, which admittedly in our celebrity-worship culture is a tad distorted, but be relatable, then say all the right things to get them riled up.

9034 2018-06-02 18:19:29 RUSSIA supported North Korea and broke with Int'l sanctions on oil export to the peninsula, which (of course) Putin denied. RUSSIAN interest's($)?? Ummm. I'm sure it goes far beyond this. SIMPLETON & Company, without fail, always has dubious intent(SHADY as hell)about everything.
9035 2018-06-02 18:19:28 Me too, they have 3 unacceptable qualities for a modern mass produced powerplant, namely fuel & oil consumption combined with belt change intervals.

9037 2018-06-02 18:19:02 Went through my closet today, and the amount of shirts I had to get rid of because of oil stains from all the food I’ve dropped on myself is embarrassing. 
9038 2018-06-02 18:18:56 we hit an intersection on city life, isolated country comfort aesthetics, and affordability other cities and Texas don’t have  and Austin is only faux-diverse ... just because your whites think their chaco sandals make them mayo w olive oil doesn’t mean the city is diverse lol
9039 2018-06-02 18:18:45 Apparently a highway in Poland was closed the other day because a truck overturned and spilled 12 tons of molten chocolate!

The reports said it was harder to clean up than oil because it was solidifying as it cooled!

For some reason, this amuses me greatly!

Not giving a damn about democracy probably believes it's dead ew
9045 2018-06-02 18:18:09 We are awash in oil. It’s literally washes up on the beach in Santa Barbara as tar. We need to stick a rig in the ground off shore to relieve the pressure.
9046 2018-06-02 18:18:00 went to the credit union, gonna get my oil changed! the day progresses and i am still motivated!
9047 2018-06-02 18:17:48 Lets hear Uhuru tomorrow on oil.Let's us know how crude or refined he is.Let's know whether he is a freedom fighter or a home Guard.Tomorrow.

9059 2018-06-02 18:16:47 The best advice I ever had is to not push it too hard. Sketch lots, and make it fun and absorbing. Don’t be afraid to move on if it’s not working. When I’m in a rut I reach for oil pastels and a piece of fruit - it’s fast and spontaneous and brilliant for understanding colour.
9060 2018-06-02 18:16:42 Gentleman, thats like moses telling the fellas to let Jethros girls water their livestock first at midians well in the ten commandments.  How the hell are they supposed to get their oil to Syria's Port safely?  Just askin?
9061 2018-06-02 18:16:41 Trump allowed the US to produce more oil than ever before. OPEC is keeping the supply repressed.
9062 2018-06-02 18:16:37 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
9063 2018-06-02 18:16:25 It’s true. We used to, and some countries still do, burn wood and oil inside our homes for energy, until Edison and Tesla came along to produce bulbs and electric  grids. Elon’s  is an extension of making outdoors cleaner like electricity did for our homes. Love it. 
9064 2018-06-02 18:16:13 He has the mobility of an oil tanker, no pace, below average ball control.. i could go on. Henderson is the better player by miles

9067 2018-06-02 18:15:56 Hey, thought you said gas prices would be the lowest ever during your Presidency? Don’t you have some business deal you can use to get OPEC To lower the price of oil? Asking for all of us common people. #theconcontinues

9069 2018-06-02 18:15:53 @mepratap why people are not thinking about, how our government repayed the $6.5 billions crude oil due.
9070 2018-06-02 18:15:52 Careful, I was insulting people long before you were hatched..... 
9071 2018-06-02 18:15:51 Gee dippy how about gas prices normally go up this time of year because they're switching from Winter grade to Summer grade and it's the summer travel season so the oil companies raise the price of gas slowly has nothing to do with Trump happens every year.

9099 2018-06-02 18:13:23 You should issue a correction to the effect that @Transport_gc does not ‘control’ marine oil spill response. Rather, it regulates it. Henceforth, though, a federal crown corporation, rather than @TransMtn, will probably ‘control’ @MarineResponse.
9100 2018-06-02 18:13:08 I met this lady while getting my oil changed and we became Facebook friends months ago. She entered her dog into a FB contest and won. I voted every day. This is who I am now.

9107 2018-06-02 18:12:47 I absolutely love the brand and I was excited when the foundation came out but from the way I see it (haven’t bought it yet) is that you absolutely have to use the wake and bake oil with it for it to perform the way everyone says it performs

Make senses
9116 2018-06-02 18:11:35 They should also investigate what percentage of oil comes from renewable energy and also the thermal efficiency of a combustion engine vs a fossil fuel power plant.
Most of us already know though!
9117 2018-06-02 18:11:33 Yeah your talking about 1 litre at 10.00 per week . But I push hard on it as it's not my bike but a company bike. They are company bikes I have ridden three different tigers all 2014 and all of them the same oil usage. I would imagine the triple being the same

9130 2018-06-02 18:09:55 You could be 'independent', after a fashion. But you'd be skint. You'd lose the £10 billion annual fiscal transfer from rUK, for a start.

9143 2018-06-02 18:08:00 I love the engine and gears. But it uses so much oil I do about 500-600 miles per week and have to fill it up by 700ml . Apparently it's because it's a large capacity engine with only three cylinders. Because the piston are large it makes the pistons /cylinders go egg shaped
9144 2018-06-02 18:07:47 OPEC is trying to ruin our economy by raising the price of oil and forcing us to raise gas prices. It's time to let loose our reserves and get prices back in line to continue America's growth and not be hindered by Muslim run Opec.

9150 2018-06-02 18:06:53 In 2003, just as the U.S. invaded Iraq, I created a model portfolio of U.S.-based oil field servicing companies. Needless to say, the portfolio did very well. Sadly, I did not actually invest in those companies at the time.

Now may be the time to repeat the exercise.

9170 2018-06-02 18:04:12 2. Saudi Arabia now has 100% ownership and control of the largest refinery in America. They can throttle the Port Arthur output based on keeping prices high.
3. The fabricated Iran crisis has provided another excuse for oil companies to raise prices.

9172 2018-06-02 18:04:01 So looks like I’m allergic to banana boat tanning oil 
9173 2018-06-02 18:03:55 When you’re getting your oil changed, then they turn on the radio & Pandora immediately turns on & starts playing Backstreet Boys
9174 2018-06-02 18:03:48 Also industrial military happily instrumentalised Western feminist concern about treatment of women under Taliban (no other Westerners cared before 9/11), and grew that into a blanket islamophobic narrative to fuel wars for oil.

9176 2018-06-02 18:03:43 TBF there was that time when someone I knew had tried making a cake using olive oil and she asked me to try it and tell her what I thought but it was a really strange colour and I knew it was going to be awful so I just told her I didn’t eat cake.
9177 2018-06-02 18:03:30 ฮือ
9178 2018-06-02 18:03:30 You're mad. Who is the 'we' who send things south? Businesses, not the state. Oil revenue is pretty much zero now. It is only the tax take that counts. You've hoovered up the SNP's crap propaganda and now parrot it. rUK exports vehicles, aircraft, pharmaceuticals, and much more.
9179 2018-06-02 18:03:26 Dey b iffy on dese oil change prices
9180 2018-06-02 18:03:24 Crude oil production in the US is at a record high, so why are gas prices high & rising?
1. Foreign oil companies are NOW allowed to pump US crude oil & EXPORT it. So, US crude is pumped from our gulf by foreign companies, depleting our limited resource, and shipped to Europe.
9181 2018-06-02 18:03:15 All for the oil
9182 2018-06-02 18:03:10 i’ve been taking fish oil and my cramps were SIGNIFICANTLY less painful this month.  I was also less bloated.
9183 2018-06-02 18:03:06 #BattleOfBritain From 15 May 1940 a night bomber campaign was launched against the German oil industry, communications and forest/crops
9184 2018-06-02 18:03:01 And also the oil production has slipped under 1.3M from 3M, but candidate @petrogustavo keeps saying the problem is the Dutch disease and not the socialist government? In appreciation that you are a serious economist, I would expect a serious answer for both our countries.
9185 2018-06-02 18:02:56 We should be. Trump can crush us on steel, then on autos then squeeze us on oil (because we are too stupid to not build pipelines to access other markets). Trump winning, Trudeau losing.
9186 2018-06-02 18:02:56 Nigeria got more oil then England.oil is money
9187 2018-06-02 18:02:38 3/If Jewell is right, displacing oil should be our lowest priority. 1) ditch coal 100% 2) energy efficiency, esp. building stock 3) electrifiy industry 4) electrify transportation aggressively after next gen of EV batteries hit market in the early 2030.
9188 2018-06-02 18:02:34 Real Donald Trump. I've always had an interest in politics, since going to work for Kenneth Betz, Reg.of Deeds, 1964. A retired Standard Oil Man of great integrity & honor. The character traits Donald Trump, for a number of years, had considered living up to, for family& Country.
9189 2018-06-02 18:02:24 You still wasting taxpayer money to scout out what you're going to sell out to big oil & gas, mining interests or the timber industry?

We are ONE family bitches
9194 2018-06-02 18:02:04 Lucic is a smart, team guy. He struck oil on his final contract and—being a smart guy—he knows it. I hope and expect him to live up to the high professional/leadership standards that Chiarelli asked of him. In doing so, he can still provide value, even if hes outside the top six.
9195 2018-06-02 18:01:55 @GaneshVMK long term solution to petrol rate hike would be to blend ethanol with oil on large scale production & hybrid vehicles. The good news India's 1st Bio-refinery is under construction in Numaligarh-Assam for ethanol productivity from bamboo. @PanchananRay1 @premdah
9196 2018-06-02 18:01:51 Exactly what it was planned for, remove the Ottoman empire from the oil
9197 2018-06-02 18:01:49 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!

9202 2018-06-02 18:01:20 @KellyannePolls we can save COAL .extracting oil from coal highest quality oil . 41% more oil reserves & plant that can do this can be built EAST KY. coal comp. ready to fund project . first plant built in WW2 no pollution AIR, WATER  & makes UNITED STATES self reliant. retweet.
9203 2018-06-02 18:01:16 Ooh *sucks teeth* I'm not an expert  but I've seen dents being steamed out successfully, with a wet cloth and an iron. Sort of swells the wood up again. Once it's dry you oil or polish. But..
9204 2018-06-02 18:01:15 Agreed.  Guessing it's because of sheer volume lowering the fryer oil temp.
9205 2018-06-02 18:01:13 Barley 11 am and I’ve already finished my laundry, did an oil change on my car, and washed and detailed the inside of the car as well! Now time for the A’s game!
9206 2018-06-02 18:01:10 I wonder if it bothers @EricTrump and @DonaldJTrumpJr that television depicts them as absolute oil slicked morons everyday and their dad never says boo about it. But God forbid someone calls @IvankaTrump a naughty word and Daddy is breaking the law to demand they be fired? LOL!
9207 2018-06-02 18:01:04 pour a little bit of coconut oil into your kale so its easier to scrape into the trash.
9208 2018-06-02 18:00:59 Jha 2  you din pay Iran 6 billion dollars for oil , it was another burden along with countless scam your party did . Election by election your party is shrinking , trust me ppl of India will make themselves congress mukt very soon .
9209 2018-06-02 18:00:56 Look to Norway and see what's possible. They extract roughly the same amount of oil yet they make a huge profit but in the UK they make a loss 
9210 2018-06-02 18:00:52 YPG/SDF offers stability to keep the oil flowing.  SAA is already stretched too thin.
9211 2018-06-02 18:00:44 Is it same as your crude oil prediction ?
9212 2018-06-02 18:00:41 2/For oil demand to trend to zero by 2050 requires massive electrification of transportation. Not going to happen without very aggressive policy intervention. Cf. Dr. Jessica Jewell in several of my columns: In her modelling, power gen always leads, transportation always lags.
9213 2018-06-02 18:00:31 Barrel of Oil: Barel adalah standar ukuran volume minyak mentah dalam perdagangan minyak internasional.

9215 2018-06-02 18:00:16 Carry hair oil so he can oil the scalp while at it
9216 2018-06-02 18:00:12 Hey! I actually work with a great company, it's called @NaturesUltra and they have all organic products with high quality cbd oil. 99.7% pure cbd and the drops actually taste good. I use them, my dogs use them, my friends have kids using them, super awesome stuff.
9217 2018-06-02 18:00:10 I thought my delivery today was like almost all toilet roll and i was well happy bc /sensory/ i love doing it bc its soft and some of em smell so good like shea butter n coconut oil but then i spotted. the cage of household bottles. No
9218 2018-06-02 18:00:09 Wondering why their skin looking like a days worth of fry grease but coconut oil is life
9219 2018-06-02 18:00:03 Getting my oil changed in my car, just waiting for one of these guys to come out and offer me something else that I NEED because they know I don’t know any better. 
Never fails.
9220 2018-06-02 18:00:02 Burning the MIDNIGHT OIL should never be for nothing but something totally worth!!! Don't do it if you won't do it...!!
9221 2018-06-02 17:59:59 It is antiAmerican to report on such things! Don't you know climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese to destroy good jobs in the American coal industry? I have it on good authority from the oil companies that hydrocarbons are good for us! And carbon dioxide is life!
9222 2018-06-02 17:59:55 @Newsweek @USATODAY @Salon @Reuters @nytimes @MSNBC @CNN @AP @WSJ Koch Bro’s/oil/coal &downstream industries have scientific proof “climate change” &life is affected; under DJT’s Pruitt, will suck every drop of minerals out of earth, 2 implosion. Beyond earth deserves better.
9223 2018-06-02 17:59:49 I’m getting my oil changed so I’m in the back, you good fam! 
9224 2018-06-02 17:59:44 Eh, he has a history of producing results. This is a bad miss for sure, but a snake oil salesman is a bit silly. It’s not like the gophers were the only team that wanted Vic
9225 2018-06-02 17:59:41 Bandages or cotton balls soaked in tea tree oil.... leave on overnight for 2-3 days
9226 2018-06-02 17:59:23 Dear Queen Elizabeth, Preisdent Donald Trump, Mrs. Angela Merkel, Iranians have well undertood that the Mullahs installed in Iran through your governments are for cheap crude oil and natural gas and fullfil the role of your long hand to KILL Iranians and to Imprision Iranians!
9227 2018-06-02 17:59:15 I love the way your skin shimmers and glistens with that oil. 
9228 2018-06-02 17:59:05 OILに関しては 直近ｻﾎﾟｰﾄではなく 週足ｻﾎﾟｰﾄを割ろうかどうかという場面 大注目である
9229 2018-06-02 17:59:02 Yeah. I dont read. Barely know how.

One thing, have fun trying to fly and move supplies back and forth with your solar and wind garbage.

Solar and wind are complementary sources.  Coal and oil do and will continue to do all the heavy lifting
9230 2018-06-02 17:59:02 The price should have been eesuced when oil price was down, I agree..
9231 2018-06-02 17:58:53 1/Sorry, Jaccard's paper is already way out of date. Cf. Canadian Energy Research Institute's 2018 oil sands annual supply cost study. Producers like Cenovus already have cost costs of $7-$10/b, declining another 20% by 2022. This is what I mean by academics need to catch up.
9232 2018-06-02 17:58:45 Oil and gas have been getting billions yearly in subsidies, taxpayers dollars have to go to things like healthcare, schools, infrastructure, better energy technologies, social services and the like! Oil and gas are bleeding us dry, time to turn off the tap of taxpayers $ to oil!
9233 2018-06-02 17:58:18 Nothing like getting a hungover oil change
9234 2018-06-02 17:58:17 Hope the Oil don't draft Smith.  I think he disappears in big games.  Would rather Oilers took Bode Wilde if looking at dmen if all the others are gone.  Otherwise take Veleno, or trade down and take Bokk to play with Drai.  German connection.

9240 2018-06-02 17:57:45 Setting that aside, am I the only one who feels like he doesn't look like a quarterback? If I saw him on the street I'd be more inclined to ask him to change my oil than give me an autograph...
9241 2018-06-02 17:57:43 ladies, if your man doesn’t give you a full blown body massage with oil & a hot towel when you’re experiencing period pain you need to find a new man
9242 2018-06-02 17:57:42 This mechanic is flirting with me. Listen boss, unless you talking about a free oil change I ain't tryna hear it lol
9243 2018-06-02 17:57:39 I HAVE OIL FOR PAN AND MAYBE USE BUTTER AS SUBSTITUTE?
9244 2018-06-02 17:57:39 I am disabled and depend on this oil very much! Love on a fixed income so I don't have much money to buy it. Please, I'd love to win!
9245 2018-06-02 17:57:39 my bfs sub got soggy from the oil and vinegar and he says "*siiiiiiiiiigh* can you fix this please?"

9254 2018-06-02 17:56:21 @Enterprise reserved a full size car, show up, no car, “we will upgrade you to a sante fe” 25 min later they say it needs an oil change and can’t rent it but they have a truck. Thanks but I have my own truck that gets better mpg than your F150. That was the point in renting a car
9255 2018-06-02 17:56:18 I'm going on a date but I actually look like I've been covered in oil I'm so sweaty
9256 2018-06-02 17:56:10 Dnt be such a fool na, tz just lyk u saying Bam oil is also bamteddy oil..

9257 2018-06-02 17:56:09 People wanna suddenly act like tumble wave is a legitimate thing that deserves respect but where were y’all when OK Oil Company, Austin Snodgrass, Paxton Reed, and Twayng McGraw were out here doing the goddamn thing? 
9258 2018-06-02 17:55:59 A squeaky wheel gets the oil

9262 2018-06-02 17:55:42 Americans are assisting the Saudis (who are being sued for blowing up world trade center-new York) in blowing up land on Yemen so that oil terrorist can get their ships thru. Bibi Mossad steals and kills scientist, will bibi kill California,largest eco, in a blink of the eye.$$$
9263 2018-06-02 17:55:38 Organic Coconut oil is that bitch 
9264 2018-06-02 17:55:30 yes but also sober. No smiles. My guess is that they dont want people to think its mind altering because its an alternative to vaping hash oil.
9265 2018-06-02 17:55:30 This is simple arithmetic. By the time oil price hits $100, subsidy will as well hit #2.7trillion. Then eye go clear everybody.
9266 2018-06-02 17:55:20 Oil change cooliant and break fluid 120 ugh mean while car wash getting baby CLEAN is a must !
9267 2018-06-02 17:55:16 Should i remind you how was your shitty country before you discovered oil and natural ressurces ?

9272 2018-06-02 17:54:46 How is oil reaped in Scotland which is stolen by England a shared history?
9273 2018-06-02 17:54:43 Liberals just do not understand economic recovery. They try but they listen to the wrong folks. Nancy being one of them. Wow we are moving forward and America is great again. We must have oil higher as the companies will drill for more. More drilling more jobs. More jobs,= better
9274 2018-06-02 17:54:42 I spy with my eye, two oil money teams
9275 2018-06-02 17:54:39 We have direct first hand indicatiors inside that they will NOT support the regime if there R alternative sources to pay their wages collapse of the currency & closing oil markets will make it hard 2 sustain their payrolls
9276 2018-06-02 17:54:39 Petrol depends upon international cruide oil jo 110 dollar Tha tab kyun ki war hui thi USA and Iran k bich mai 2004. So petrol price were increased Ab vo 80 dollar Hai. Petrol price should be reduced.  Stop copy paste of what's msg.  Thoda Google pe padh le English aati ho toh
9277 2018-06-02 17:54:33 @Ncoleycole hi, you got any more of those oil change coupons?
9278 2018-06-02 17:54:33 Oil rolling over and dollar had face ripping rally, usdcad has done nothing. Gold still flirting with 1300 zone. EEM went sideways in the meantime. Interesting !!!
9279 2018-06-02 17:54:30 The manager at the Oil Change always calls me "Pretty Lady" 
9280 2018-06-02 17:54:23 #england v nigeria *Iheanacho bows head before he goes on* Hubakabba! Oil ah mek mi no head butt mi team mate!
9281 2018-06-02 17:54:17 BUT, a guy taught me how to manually take off my “oil change required” light with the pedals lol so that’s cool.
9282 2018-06-02 17:54:14 Can’t believe I have to pay $70 for a dang oil change...
9283 2018-06-02 17:54:12 @narendramodi please look into real issues of this country like rising oil prices, economic growth, please stop controlling RBI and Governer. We need strong Governer like Raghuram Rajan. Further don't waste our money in travelling overseas, do something for us
9284 2018-06-02 17:54:01 Does small government include trillions in bailouts to Too Big To Fail Banks that crash the entire planet's economy? How about subsidies and tax breaks equaling 10s if billions to Oil Corporations? What about the 650 billion to "Defence?" 80 billion on "drug interdiction?"
9285 2018-06-02 17:53:52 Lol I heard if u drink castor oil it’ll wrk
9286 2018-06-02 17:53:34 good need anything yae gas price are bouceing almost 4 dollar a gallon oil prices bounce up 30 cents
9287 2018-06-02 17:53:32 @realDonaldTrump MR. PRESIDENT I FEEL THAT THE MAJOR OIL COMPANIES NEED TO START LOWERING THE GAS PRICES FOR THE HARD WORKING MIDDLE CLASS, POOR AMERICANS. THERE NEEDS TO BE A PUSH BACK AGAINST THESE OIL COMPANIES AND THEIR LOBBY, SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP FRIENDS. #SAD
9288 2018-06-02 17:53:25 Not only was there no line to get my oil changed, after the 6th attempt I was able to get a hot and ready pizza that was actually both hot and ready at @littlecaesars.  This event was months in the making.
9289 2018-06-02 17:53:23 Getting our oil & gas to foreign markets via new pipelines, would go a long way towards paying for needed infrastructure.  #cdnpoli

9292 2018-06-02 17:52:31 Well, the US drilling rig count and crude oil stock pile has increased recently, and has capped the crude oil’s price rally.
9293 2018-06-02 17:52:29 Lmao talking about oil down and tell me why “sweat oil down” pop through my brain 
Boyy that was some kixx

9298 2018-06-02 17:51:58 True, but I don't know what Brady advocates now, he might be in favour of EEA/EFTA, which, while still not great, is, at least defensible. At least, he doesn't appear on TV at every opportunity selling snake oil and unicorns like Redwood and IDS.
9299 2018-06-02 17:51:38 I’m not arguing about climate change, simply replying to your comments regarding cost and economics of a particular pipeline. Canada and world need a plenty of oil for as long as forecasts look ahead. Challenge is to produce, transport, use it as cleanly and safely as possible.

9301 2018-06-02 17:51:21 Candance, more grace and strength to you 
Ps 23:5-6
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
You anoint my head with oil;
My cup runs over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days of my life;
And I will [d]dwell in the house of the Lord
Forever.
9302 2018-06-02 17:51:12 Hardly a second oil boom is it? Anyway it’s all down to revenue and the price of extraction.  Whilst I hope many oil workers get their jobs back I don’t look forward to “It’s oor oil “ all over again.
9303 2018-06-02 17:51:09 Sir, its bureaucratic decision to price it according to oil market. Both @INCIndia and @BJP4India are following it. Best indirect tax for the Govt - Both State and Central?
9304 2018-06-02 17:51:07 I think so. Lol it’s my fave. I grill it first to reduce the oil/fat.
9305 2018-06-02 17:50:51 @odysseuslahori Hahahahaha. Never thought that I would hear this from a Pakistani. Anyway, the oil is going to run out soon and the rest of Asia is only getting richer. Things will be soon back to where they were.
9306 2018-06-02 17:50:31 Well i went in for an oil change.......
9307 2018-06-02 17:50:28 I just bought the Ryobi with the 40V battery. Highly recommend, it works great, no gas, oil or cord! One battery charge should finish your entire yard.

9309 2018-06-02 17:50:26 I’m going to invent a cash app but for weed so for my birthday people can send me weed and oil cartridges and edibles. I would love that
9310 2018-06-02 17:50:16 Essential  oils, Lavender. I got into a fight with a small scorpion and it nailed my knee 5 times. Lavender oil made the stings almost painless and no swelling. gone in 2 days.
9311 2018-06-02 17:50:15 and add a dash of olive oil
9312 2018-06-02 17:50:11 I deadass got charged $145 for an oil change LMFAO
9313 2018-06-02 17:50:07 There’s a store in downtown Summerlin where I get some jalapeño oil and it’s good with popcorn
9314 2018-06-02 17:50:01 last year was his first solid season, Kbomb would be a good comparison. the one reason I would agree with you is because Chia does like to spend money like a drunk oil worker.
9315 2018-06-02 17:49:59 He has the mobility of an oil tanker
9316 2018-06-02 17:49:58 Suspension. Oil leaks. Starter noise.
9317 2018-06-02 17:49:52 Govt doesnt sell fuel, Oil Cos do. Anyways, there's never a dearth of mungeri lal stuff - carry on
9318 2018-06-02 17:49:48 Lol! Is this a parody? Comparing oil producing dictatorships with an oil importing democracy!
9319 2018-06-02 17:49:39 Nearly there! New piston & rings might prove cheaper than gallons of oil for the return journey.
9320 2018-06-02 17:49:38 Yeh Nawaz Sharif international oil prices bhi dictate karta hai
9321 2018-06-02 17:49:22 Soon to be the oil drilling and mineral mining when all of the national monuments get abolished.
9322 2018-06-02 17:49:16 Ah, right....BP the oil folks....Sorry, had a senior moment there....or rather a Daffy Duck one...I have LOTS of the latter.... xx
9323 2018-06-02 17:49:05 Leah and I will be with Tone Vays on his Trading Bitcoin vlog this afternoon at approx. 4:00 EST. Probably talk about stocks, gold and oil at the same time. @ToneVays @YouTube
9324 2018-06-02 17:49:05 Adulting hard today. Just got all four tires on my car replaced and now getting oil changed and wipers replaced too. Trying to get my car in tip top shape!
9325 2018-06-02 17:49:04 All I use is castor oil on it & get braids . No perms , no heat & I barely comb my hair lol
9326 2018-06-02 17:49:00 You can start exploring & producing your own oil
9327 2018-06-02 17:48:59 He's no environmentalist but maybe he'll act in this case cause it doesn't involve oil .... #fakeenvironmentalistTrudeau
9328 2018-06-02 17:48:58 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
9329 2018-06-02 17:48:54 I like to use a heat stable oil, (currently Spectrum's organic shortening). I heat the pan, then rub the oil in, let it get a bit warmer but not to smoking, cool, wipe off excess & repeat. I do rinse mine with hot water if there's something saucy on it, never detergents though.
9330 2018-06-02 17:48:35 So clean and oil your guns as needed!
9331 2018-06-02 17:48:31 By combining their capacities for oil that democratizes information move beyond our imagination.
9332 2018-06-02 17:48:29 Ebuehi is a spice. I’ve been saying this since. Real life Mobil 01 premium engine oil.

9334 2018-06-02 17:48:23 I wanna know who really comes to delta sonic & pays $20 for a oil change cause these signs ..... ALL LIES !
9335 2018-06-02 17:48:11 Get a full tank, vaccum the inside, wash the outside, and get the oil changed, after that I’ll feel better
9336 2018-06-02 17:48:10 Any suggestions for a good oil free drug store foundation for oily skin?! SOMEBODY HELP ME.
9337 2018-06-02 17:48:06 I was so sad I couldn’t eat there cause of peanut oil. We waited like 30 minutes too.
9338 2018-06-02 17:48:04 In the meantime use oil and a highlighter either mixed together or applied with a brush after on the places that will show lol
9339 2018-06-02 17:47:55 A wiseman once said that violence is the oil that greases the engine of history.
9340 2018-06-02 17:47:49 In the United States the government doesn't own the oil companies so they don't control it's all based off free market also the reason why winter gas is cheaper is because of additives they have to put in the fuel like ethanol
9341 2018-06-02 17:47:46 "Bona Fide"! more like BONE FRIED, SHHHQDHQHDHQHDHQHDHSDPQHDSPHDPQ (oil noises)
9342 2018-06-02 17:47:46 Fun suiting run but this UA is wet like it was held underwater. Eww. Tempting to clean up in the pool, but remember that oil slick disaster in the Gulf? A swim would be like that except w floating Cat Cheese or something more gross, if possible.
9343 2018-06-02 17:47:39 Jamaican castor oil let it sit in ya beard for 15 minutes then rinse it out
9344 2018-06-02 17:47:31 If you are gonna take ur car to Walmart to get an oil change, do not go to California Walmart cuz by the time u get down the street your car might be seriously messed up cuz they can’t do their job
9345 2018-06-02 17:47:13 Yes yes. Malapit ka na pati magwork. HAHAHAHA Nakakagutom! Chili oil pa 
9346 2018-06-02 17:47:09 the one day i decide to do good and put oil in my hair i put way too much now my hair looks wet
9347 2018-06-02 17:46:31 Man the oil and gas industry must love @gmbutts He just keeps throwing unearned massive amounts of taxpayers money for nothing! #gasplant #KinderMorgan
9348 2018-06-02 17:46:30 CBD oil under .3% THC is legal now in all 50 state, I can ship it to your door no problem
9349 2018-06-02 17:46:26 Check the Daily and the Evening Standard before giving out the snake oil.
Then come back and apologise.
9350 2018-06-02 17:46:26 What is a barrel of oil and gas? Easy. A Tory politician on the make.
9351 2018-06-02 17:46:16 How do I become an oil expert? 
9352 2018-06-02 17:46:16 @Shell @Chevron @Esso_GB @exxonmobil Thoughts and prayers are with the families of the oil executives - hope they aren’t starving.
9353 2018-06-02 17:46:12 Norway has huge oil and gas; Switzerland has bankers and their secrets. I'm afraid of loosing our existing markets, and no one has pointed out where the benefits are. Are they with the now-protectionist USA? #stopbrexit
9354 2018-06-02 17:46:09 Vaseline is like coconut oil, the remedy for everything
9355 2018-06-02 17:46:09 cuticle oil smells so amazing
9356 2018-06-02 17:45:55 Time for a oil change
9357 2018-06-02 17:45:55 I know gas is cheap in those countries they had a lot to do with how the country is run and a substitute he's or some other way of doing things for example in Kuwait most of the workers are foreign because the oil is owned by the government and they spread the wealth
9358 2018-06-02 17:45:24 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
9359 2018-06-02 17:45:18 One cannot do without tea and cookies! Like the sun and the moon! Water and oil!
9360 2018-06-02 17:45:09 Leaving Totota with a free: oil change,tire rotation, airbag replacement, and car wash 
9361 2018-06-02 17:45:09 Bruh facts. Niggas might as well eat sugar and flour and drink oil cuz sheesh
9362 2018-06-02 17:45:06 We should be discussing how Russia funds environmentalist groups so the US becomes divested in green energy and stops using oil so we can't compete with them in Europe. Climate change is just propaganda.
9363 2018-06-02 17:44:35 It will be a crime against humanity when climate change puts the entire state of Florida under water. Ignoring climate change for the sake of oil profit is the same as watching a car speed towards a child in the road and just walking away & letting it happen.

Should be opposite! Stop oil being sold off shore! reduce federal taxes on oil! Tell oil cos to reduce gas prices !
9367 2018-06-02 17:44:00 Some kind of beautiful "snake oil salesman" inception
9368 2018-06-02 17:43:41 last time i checked the price of oil was at $76 a barrel. the Rand is expected to weaken further. transport costs sheesh
9369 2018-06-02 17:43:36 Alberta is rebounding from oil recession of the last two years. I am a public employee and no lay offs, investor confidence is coming back to Calgary, the construction business and housing are doing well . Job creation is on the upswing including oil and gas
9370 2018-06-02 17:43:33 Lol Una go chop am, no be by jersey
9371 2018-06-02 17:43:13 The considerable and vocal forces who think that oil is the root of all human evil have been distracted. We can't contemplate an orderly and inevitable transition when public discourse has been polluted by the social media and when our democracy is at risk from same. #cdnpoli
9372 2018-06-02 17:43:05 Random, but have you tried it with a teaspoon of coconut oil in it? Coffee destroys me but I had a coconut oil coffee a while back (Black no sugar) and I didn’t bloat. Had it as usual the next day (milk and sugar) but with coconut oil added and I was fine. Worth a shot?
9373 2018-06-02 17:42:58 Bálor & his baby oil snap has me weak af LORD HELP ME

9380 2018-06-02 17:42:08 That’s how Chicago is  try using Hemp Oil instead of lotion, it doesn’t feel as heavy
9381 2018-06-02 17:42:04 Different era's pal. Just exposes how little you know on the subject of Venezuela. The country flourished under Chavez and only started to truly deteriorate shortly before his death. The reason it deteriorated? US sanctions on oil and other trade, not because of leftist policy.
9382 2018-06-02 17:41:59 Hoy es con fuel oil
9383 2018-06-02 17:41:48 If I could go one day without oil being sprayed on my face that’d be cool
9384 2018-06-02 17:41:47 I would generally agree with you but pulling out of the Iran deal wasn’t well thought out and put direct upward pressure on oil prices

9386 2018-06-02 17:41:41 I finally got to play West of Loathing on the Switch and I love it. It's probably the most I've laughed out loud at a game in a while.

The only major bummer is that the expert level snake oil combat items crash the game immediately.
9387 2018-06-02 17:41:38 NAOKIのCDいいねええ！！
9388 2018-06-02 17:41:32 Yeah, do that at home or away from people. Or get the oil and use a vape.
9389 2018-06-02 17:41:23 The problem is that like an oil tanker changes appear almost imperceptible-movement likewise,many think nearly 30 months after the vote and their job is still there and their mates down the pub still ok, that nothing is to change. But the clouds are gathering and it will rain!
9390 2018-06-02 17:41:16 Michael on his last day said you know who is “a snake oil salesman who gets easily done over by other snake oil salesmen”...that’s stuck with me haha
9391 2018-06-02 17:41:12 What I hear in your response is consumption-based accounting for GHG emissions. In which case oil sands emissions numbers go way down, as per Fellows et al. And you know that SAGD op costs are down to $20/b, competitive with Tier 1 Permian Basin wells, right?
9392 2018-06-02 17:41:07 Except the DAPL will be used to sell oil to other countries. Like, literally. That's what it's for.

It will only enrich oil execs. It won't help us.
9393 2018-06-02 17:40:50 What has happened to reason, logic, education!
Shame on you guys for believing anything uncritically. A 60 second google search would show its from 2016 and the organization has NO contacts, no members, no names associated NOTHING! Wow i have some snake oil to sell you lot!
9394 2018-06-02 17:40:48 Getting a lube job & screwed over

9396 2018-06-02 17:40:39 I rather oil than lotion
9397 2018-06-02 17:40:37 I added orange oil to it. Smells great!
9398 2018-06-02 17:40:36 I hate when that page just tries to dumb down African dish names. It’s native jollof rice. Wtf is “Palm Oil Jollof”.
9399 2018-06-02 17:40:35 Really? To bankrupt a province of our nation? To layoff hundreds of thousands of workers? To make their kids homeless and hungry JUST because you wanna FEEL better?! You’re worse than I thought. Why don’t you boycott Saudi Arabia oil? They will pickup the slack no problem!

9406 2018-06-02 17:40:06 Last night, my phone blew up from one of our most recent clients for CBD oil. She is an older woman who started taking the oil 8 days ago. EIGHT DAYS AGO. She has not been able to walk for 3 years and now she is walking up and down stairs like normal. Touches my heart.
9407 2018-06-02 17:40:02 As you popped up in my TL I wanted to thank you for all your recent excellent contributions to GCN.

From the days my kids used transfer tattoos, I seem to remember baby oil worked.

9409 2018-06-02 17:39:53 Não é assim que economia ou administração funcionam. A petro tem q considerar o preço internacional pois entra em sua estrutura de  custos, já q parte do petróleo é importado. Outros setores, outras realidades. Estamos falando da indústria de oil & gas aqui.
9410 2018-06-02 17:39:49 Saute baby spinach and chicken together with a bit of olive oil. Quick meal. Sometimes I add in salsa and sprinkle Reggiano cheese on top

9412 2018-06-02 17:39:49 I wanna learn how to change my own oil in my car since I can change my tire.
9413 2018-06-02 17:39:44 Most people who are vehemently for the pipeline are people who make money off of big oil. In my experience.

9415 2018-06-02 17:39:07 @FreshMenuIndia  I had the most horrible experience. I ordered two items from your menu and both were drenched in oil and tasted disgusting. The fish fingers were stale and inedible. Don't you have any quality checks before you send out the food? Order : FM12114866 #freshmenu
9416 2018-06-02 17:39:05 @KellyannePolls Kelly, PLS tell Potus he needs to talk to US mnfacturs to lower pirces autos, steel should be cheaper use more US. Oil should be less in America verses selling overseas raising our prices. Gas is one thing he should  make inexpensive drives economy!

9418 2018-06-02 17:38:47 Called @Honda bc I needed to know how to reset the oil life in my car, they told me to come down and they could reset it. Asked @YouTube same question, done in 10 seconds.

9421 2018-06-02 17:38:17 PS #Russia is the one attacking us. Picking Iran because, as Trump said, should have taken the oil when made the deal. Even though the public was mislead about WMD. It would be stealing.
9422 2018-06-02 17:38:15 Burdock Root; Comfrey; Coconut Oil; Turmeric. Simmer the herbs with Spring Water to make the infusion. Add the Coconut Oil (organic, virgin).  Ice the finger first for the swelling  Wrap the concoction with gauze Repeat 2-4 times per day.

9425 2018-06-02 17:38:00 I have actually. We addressed our wedding invitations in crude oil & the collected tears of orphaned puppies.
9426 2018-06-02 17:37:52 Why would they have trouble? The pipeline itself has made clear sense from day 1. Both as an infrastructure system component and as a key strategic asset to Canada's oil industry. The problems have always been political and with the irrational concept of "social licence".
9427 2018-06-02 17:37:51 Never experienced anything like this. I have narrow ear canals so they get ‘clogged’ I treat with oil & get them irrigated. I had them irrigated beginning May but still felt blocked ...now I know why. Sinus & middle ear!

9433 2018-06-02 17:36:54 Jordan, country with no natural resources, and a moderate beacon of stability in the region has taken in hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, adding hundreds of millions to its nat'l debt.

Can't any of the mega wealthy oil states help a brother out?
9434 2018-06-02 17:36:53 Take the blinders off. This govt. Let Kinder Morgan slip away and has burdened Canadians with a pipeline. Btw when will see it running oil. He failed to negotiate trade deals with Trump and now chooses to lecture DT on his lack of common sense.
9435 2018-06-02 17:36:52 My point is Tmp is already shipping many types of energy including dilbit. This is nothing new. Also you may be interested to know most of the gasoline in BC comes from US refiners which use oil exported  from oilsands. The new Tmp line will reduce rail shipments of oilsands oil

I remember during the fiest Gulf War when Halliburton was one of only two companies IN THE WORLD that had the capability and resources to put out the dozens and dozens of oil well fires.

9442 2018-06-02 17:36:10 Well small companies have higher insurance anyway.  Also, you should be able to remember when your in surance shot through the roof in your early 30’s.  Thanks to Bush’s schemes to get insurance and oil companies paid.

9446 2018-06-02 17:35:44 The problem with smoking is the THC an hallucinogen. It’s a shame he could not be treated with cannabis oil much safer. Marijuana made my sons worst. He stopped breathing on me one day. I ad to resuscitate him in my home. No way should these parents be jailed. They need help.

9456 2018-06-02 17:35:08 Have you actually written in crude oil? Liquid gold they say.
9457 2018-06-02 17:34:56 Me: Motivated enough to drive an hour to work, work a full day, drive to class, get out of class at 8, drive an hour home, take the trash out, change my oil, cut my own hair, shower. 

Also me: Too lazy to toast my @PopTartsUS.
9458 2018-06-02 17:34:51 Eh - some1 told u? Govt issued special bonds to Oil Cos to partially cover some of the losses. Plus took explicit subsidy on the budget

9462 2018-06-02 17:34:35 finally got this oil change over with
9463 2018-06-02 17:34:33 We ignore this because most of the emissions come from burning oil and 2C scenarios require those emissions to go down.

When oil demand goes down, the most expensive oil will fall off the market. This is seperate issue than high emmisions oil.

9466 2018-06-02 17:34:25 Bros! Don't wait till 2019! None of your promises or expectations about the oil sector have gone as planned. There's no guarantee that you can make that target  either...

9468 2018-06-02 17:34:16 One of the more interesting remedies posted but what is Purification Oil?
9469 2018-06-02 17:34:15 I am not. I have been surprised by the support I have seen in Canada for Trump’s position. I can easily see a Cross Border tax on the horizon including oil.

9473 2018-06-02 17:33:50 Update on that olive oil under eye thing.. if you have animals maybe don’t. I keep waking up to my cat licking my eyes 
9474 2018-06-02 17:33:44 Last night I sliced up the remaining pepper, sauteed in olive oil and served on top of ribeyes. Worked. :)
9475 2018-06-02 17:33:41 Use Coconut oil babe or Castor Oil
9476 2018-06-02 17:33:36 Oil - cloves, cinnamon, mustard seed, turmeric, garlic, ginger, chilli, red onion, rhubarb. Red lentils and water to stew down. Think about tempering when I see how it turns out.
9477 2018-06-02 17:33:30 Yeah, they gave him a rubber training rifle.  Rubber gun squad??

9487 2018-06-02 17:32:11 Capitalism has resulted in the absolute destruction in the environment in the pursuit of dirty oil and coal. That has lead to millions of pre mature deaths in the middle East and air pollution. Please tell me why capitalism is so great?

9496 2018-06-02 17:31:18 Can we get a MJ emoji? Truthfully, I don’t use it. I don’t NEED to use it. I wouldn’t get in the way of a person (or animal) who needs it/ benefits from it. SO many ppl w/ Cancer, seizures, & medical conditions will be helped. It’s CBD oil reduces pain AND inflammation, no ‘high’

9505 2018-06-02 17:30:43 Akuuu pakee yang calendula toner sma fresh origins serum.

Yang calendula ini kayak semacam air + bunga gitu tapi dia bisa bantu kurangin beruntusaan dan jerawat

Kalau serumnya ini HOLY GRAIL AKU dia oil cuma pas di muka langsung ngeresap

9506 2018-06-02 17:30:38 very rarely, just make sure you keep your skin clean no oil
9507 2018-06-02 17:30:36 I need to go fill up, get an oil change &’ wash my truck.. but it’s so fucking hot!
9508 2018-06-02 17:30:33 I agree. A mix of oil seed, cereal and pulse/legume is a good long term approach for a healthy productive soil. Just seeding one crop becomes a monoculture and crops don’t perform to their full potential.
9509 2018-06-02 17:30:30 Starting from today im gonna try using olive oil to massage into my stretch marks on the booty to see if they fade, I've seen so many videos on it so ill let you know

9510 2018-06-02 17:30:05 Essential oils are amazing ok!Especially peppermint, if you ever are hot during the summer get a bottle of peppermint oil put it in a spray bottle with water and shake the spray bottle. Then obviously spray anywhere you feel hot and your body will feel amazingly cool in seconds!

9517 2018-06-02 17:29:16 You might find that Venezuela struggled so badly because they rely heavily on oil, which went down massively in price and how much political corruption they suffered.
9518 2018-06-02 17:28:42 i am fully convinced that the rubber key contacts in my keyboard have been permanently damaged by the coconut oil. good thing i purchased another set
9519 2018-06-02 17:28:42 I think organized religion is awful. I think Christian fundamentalism is more detrimental to domestic politics, but Wahhabism is just as bigoted. We just love that Saudi Oil

9524 2018-06-02 17:27:54 cbd oil works wonders for my baby. my angel has very very bad anxiety and OCD (YES!!! cats can get OCD) and cbd oil has helped him become more calm and feel safer in his body. he’s become more social as well. it works and I’m so happy! I want him to live a comfortable life!
9525 2018-06-02 17:27:41 You prefer the status quo? AB oil currently boots grain off of many 1000s of railcars annually; dangerous, inefficient. We also pipe 320K bpd to climate-nightmare Koch brothers at their Pine Bend refinery in Minnesota. #KM expansion would be an improvement. #abpoli #bcpoli
9526 2018-06-02 17:27:38 Just spilled a load of oil on the kitchen floor. On the plus side we now have an indoor skating rink

9528 2018-06-02 17:27:26 Pakis did not put oil in the bearings.
9529 2018-06-02 17:27:22 They are both Arabic speaking and Islamic believing... you see, what goes on in these rich oil fields, is not always, seen, is it by our Western politicians... it is interesting..
9530 2018-06-02 17:27:17 If ur having a lot of pain, take a quetip, soak it in some pure clove oil and smash it against ur open tooth. It'll hurt for a bit but the oil will kill the nerve and keep it from hurting more

9536 2018-06-02 17:26:40 Yes, because it's true. The DAPL isn't going to help the US in any way (helping the oil company profits does not help us, the people. You and me,) And it's liable to do harm *to* the country. Again.

9545 2018-06-02 17:25:16 Joe - we have the worst government in SK now - NDP was far better than SP. We were not in debt like we are now. SP could  not even save money when oil was at an all time high. They blew every cent. Now high power bills, SGI plates up over $250 this year from last.....etc

9576 2018-06-02 17:21:48 Odd that. Most people in Scotland who remain no remain that way because they believe the myth we're too small, an economic backwater subsidised by England, and the oil's worthless, running out, a burden etc. That's the propaganda fed endlessly to Scots.
9577 2018-06-02 17:21:30 You go to get an oil change and they tell you the brakes are broken, you need a new filter, you’re low on gas, your credit score went down, you have three days to live...

9590 2018-06-02 17:19:54 Commodity prices change. Oil was $28 dollars and now closer to $80. Every year thousands of people lose jobs to machines and AI. The number people who die falling from local trains in Mumbai is as big as nation wide farmer suicides. Not vote bank not important. Only farmers.

Did you act against BC when it illegally blocks an approved pipeline! You certainly acted in France when you apologized for not killing the heavy oil faster?

9639 2018-06-02 17:13:31 Dollar was 52 INR. Giriraj ji is right and at that time although crude rate was high but considering dollar rate and inflation the petrol and diesel prices are similar. Sanjay ji needs to justify his statement instead of blaming BJP. Also Indian oil companies export oil.

9644 2018-06-02 17:13:07 1. How is there conflicting info on how large this tax cut is? I've seen it published as not top 10. Data? 

2. Energy independent? Don't we still get a lot of oil from outside the US? 

I agree with the rest though!
9645 2018-06-02 17:13:07 I was hoping coconut oil would help... you know cause it fixes everything... yeah I was wrong.

9668 2018-06-02 17:10:31 Our midfield was non-existent. Mikel has had to abandon the midfield to go look for crude oil in front. Joel Obi who is supposed to deputize for him has been playing as if he is a greenhorn. We had no midfield.

9670 2018-06-02 17:10:16 The equivalence argument again, this time with China. In terms of trade balances,  US's trade surplus in manufacturing with Canada and essential  raw materials + oil Canada provides China is way different.
9671 2018-06-02 17:10:14 Talvez vc possa responder com as info q tem hj. Mas e se congelarem o diesel com esse desconto de 0,46 e a gasolina em 4,2? E o OIL for p $100, USD p 4,20?
Vc estressou esse cenario? 
Por outro lado e se sair cessão onerosa?
Desculpe, mas essa pergunta, assim, n faz muito sentido
9672 2018-06-02 17:10:11 Diesel is 315 and with sanctions from the Middle East we can probably expect to pay are oil companies even more shouldn't the oil of this country belong to the citizens and not a corporation. just a thought? #FundAmerica

9679 2018-06-02 17:09:39 Just another opportunity to make money for himself and his friends. Lucrative oil contracts, commercial/military sales/, Trump branded properties...

9706 2018-06-02 17:07:02 1- Markets by nature are efficient and encourage efficient allocation of scarce resources, because if what you make money from runs out, profit incentive is destroyed. Also, as resources like oil become scarcer and price rises, alternatives like renewables become more attractive
9707 2018-06-02 17:06:47 When you find out as a soldier that you’ve been lied to and that there aren’t any “weapons of mass destruction” and you aren’t liberating anything but oil fields, of course it becomes more about dying for the men to your left and right than about your country.
9708 2018-06-02 17:06:42 A large twisting of logic happening in this article.  The oil markets are responding to the growing unrest in the Middle East which has grown specifically because of Trump's policies.   This doesn't change just because he's done other things.
9709 2018-06-02 17:06:33 Have heard that basil essential oil can help.
9710 2018-06-02 17:06:26 By importing oil from those countries we’re helping their economies instead of growing ours, not to mention we probably have no idea what extraction methods they could be using which could be hurting the environment even more... @CanadianGreens @jjhorgan #TransMountain
9711 2018-06-02 17:06:01 @ArnoldClark absolute shite service!! Bought 3 cars in 5 months!!

Second car oil filter needed

9716 2018-06-02 17:05:30 Producing our own oil, instead of relying on foreign sources might be a good idea. Forget sending the pipe over the mountains to sell the oil to china, point it east to Toronto, refine it along the way and we'll be one step closer to self sustainability. #CanadianFuture
9717 2018-06-02 17:05:27 @DrAseemMalhotra #pioppidiet why is it when i go to the supermarket 90% of food is either in sunflower oil or low fat food and full of additives and not in  olive oil just dont understand why ?

9719 2018-06-02 17:05:19 Yes sure UPA got oil free ( didn't have to pay at that time this govt is clearing this huge debt to Iran) time and situation was/,is certainly different.
9720 2018-06-02 17:05:17 You are such a classless man yourself. And character, please, you are jelly underneath that ugly face, Lucman.
9721 2018-06-02 17:05:15 Unless they are getting a Svechnikov, I wouldn’t trade up as anyone left would essentially be in a similar tier to who is available at 10 and who knows who would be better.  Oil need to accumulate young assets so I’d rather keep the sweetener than use futures to trade up.
9722 2018-06-02 17:05:09 I love the quorn nuggets! I usually dip them into some olive oil & garlic. Nice to hear that you're having such a great time lovely, have a brill evening! 
9723 2018-06-02 17:05:08 - Thank Obama for 7 yrs of market growth.
- Already signs of inevitable GOP slowdown.
- GOP war in Iraq the root cause. Thanks GWB.
- 1.1T debt for tax cuts for rich. Historic inequality.
- Not after Canada stops selling us oil in trade war.
- Not yet. Big envelope is not peace.

9729 2018-06-02 17:04:11 Mr.admin what is the price of crude oil on that time?
9730 2018-06-02 17:04:08 when isis  Add oil Supply   the prices were low And if you go into Iran or Iraq and look  At what they charge for fuel to their own people You'll  know its a  Lie.   They seem to fix prices through Spring and summer then theyll drop back down through Winter.
9731 2018-06-02 17:04:07 You bad bad 
9732 2018-06-02 17:04:07 Same way is Israel they have technology to grow food in desert. Arabs have oil but Tesla car has shown to end that's dependency. Just imagine world after that. If you do not grow up.

9739 2018-06-02 17:03:02 You may want to blame Thatcher but it was and era that had run it course. If you want blame anyone blame the NCB for not evolving and leading the in clean coal tech & mechanisation & cheap oil imprts. Digging the NCBs heels in was not the right move (National Coal Board)

9741 2018-06-02 17:02:59 Instead of obstruction, they should ask themselves does it really make sense to buy oil from other countries that most likely don’t care at all about human/women’s rights or the environment when we have perfectly good oil in our backyard?! @CanadianGreens @jjhorgan #TransMountain

9758 2018-06-02 17:00:50 I regret not going into Criminology. Partially it was the Uni's fault as the classes I could take were gutted so they can focus more on Oil & Gas. Forensics was at an odd pivot between the social sciences and chemistry, in the end even law was taken out when I was in 3rd year.

9761 2018-06-02 17:00:30 You certainly have to wonder why @Paulsoglin is running for the Dem nomination. He’s had a fine oil career. But Soglin has scant support at the Dem Convention, and his talk had all the enthusiasm of a DMV worker on a Friday afternoon.
9762 2018-06-02 17:00:25 What a sad x for the Oil Patch.  We have worked for 40 years in Exploration & have  never felt such hatred toward it.   not sure where these people think the products they use come from!

9764 2018-06-02 17:00:24 Undoing BO's deal coincides with Netanyahu & Saudi desires for war w/Iran; the military-industrial complex is (of course) always ready for another big war. Resulting higher oil prices reward/empower oil oligarchs and energy cos. T will take a slice & gets a diversion. Winning!
9765 2018-06-02 17:00:20 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

9768 2018-06-02 17:00:12 It's no secret that we have been bullied by the US market for a long time.  We give you our oil (sands) and you sell it back at a higher price.  If Canada would realize we have everything we need and not try and play nice we us anymore it's you who would suffer.
9769 2018-06-02 17:00:10 The Oil is not good. It's too expensive to get. Finds around the would will keep prices down. We have to look beyond Oil and I think together we can do a lot. We have so much in common. You already have so much devolved power

9771 2018-06-02 17:00:05 oh yeah thats why he is saving multi billion dollar coal/nuclear plants, cause he is invested in oil. He is saving them because just one nuclear plant failing could jeopardize americas security. No new ones are being built, let the old ones close down in a sane, rational way.
9772 2018-06-02 16:59:45 I’m invited to a birthday party tonight where I know no one but the birthday child. With my current anxiety level this is a stressor and now I forgot to take my CBD Oil

9774 2018-06-02 16:59:39 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
9775 2018-06-02 16:59:17 If a product actually works but isn't the normal product everyone is use too is it still snake oil?
9776 2018-06-02 16:59:07 Do you people really mean ki by bringing oil under GST will bring price down. States Hage power to increase the price. Intelligence though present in abundance some people like to store it for may be next birth. Bashing a political king for issues which if in his hand will do all

9782 2018-06-02 16:58:50 You've been conned by Trump. You have zero credibility. Should have read up on him before jumping into his snake oil wagon. Sucker. Btw, he does coke, has for years. Check out his days at Studio 54.
9783 2018-06-02 16:58:49 Be sure, if you want TRUE CBD OIL THAT whomever you purchase from is selling you NON HEMP CBD oil.

As another note...the CBD OIL has to have a trace amount of THC in order to activate the CBD otherwise it does nothing. 

Do not my waste your hard earned $$ on ANY hemp CBD oil.

9794 2018-06-02 16:57:37 Cant do that the car broke on the side of a road. I rented a car and left it at a repair shop. That is how I know that there is to much oil. The dealer should be picking it up but they are saying its not there fault. How long could the car go with to much oil?
9795 2018-06-02 16:57:36 I intermittent fast everyday and today’s end was met by eating salmon cooked in Cocnut Oil w/ 1/2 onion black and Himalayan sea salt, 1 Avocado and kale, spinach Swiss chard and red leaf lettuce. This will be a repeated meal.
9796 2018-06-02 16:57:34 You look good.

Agree with you on all those though I stopped using coconut oil because it was making my pores look large/clogged.
9797 2018-06-02 16:57:28 stick a carbon tax on the industrial Demand Side Units / Diesel Generators now at 544MW. Crazy that we are now moving back to oil generated electricity after building efficient ccgt fleet.
9798 2018-06-02 16:57:22 the dealers association didn't want anyone else besides nepal oil corp. because they would then not get the fixed commission percentage they receive now, they would have to compete and lower the selling price of petroleum products. It's a syndicate.

9803 2018-06-02 16:56:37 About time, but I still don't hold out hope. Oil companies won't want this cutting into their profits.
9804 2018-06-02 16:56:36 He used my town as a selling point for his sheep.. That does not fly here in Midland TX.. He has no concept of Big Oil no democrat does.. He is way out of his league on this one..

9806 2018-06-02 16:56:33 You fools didnt really believe 'free education' was REALLY going to be free now did you? Fuel price is so high because of additional levies and taxes, not because the oil price is particularly high.
9807 2018-06-02 16:56:31 This includes the heating oil /gas that people use to heat their homes as well.. bye bye 20 bucks a pay check
9808 2018-06-02 16:56:29 I'd happily live off garlic bread to be honest, which can be vegan if using oil, not butter.
9809 2018-06-02 16:56:25 Sorry, just like every president before him, he’s responsible for gas prices weather or not he has directly effected them. Pulling out of the Iran deal caused oil to go up. Look at a chart.
9810 2018-06-02 16:56:11 Ahhhh this enriches Canada because we get to expand our market for oil.
9811 2018-06-02 16:56:09 Today's responsible task was getting the oil changed. Maybe soon I'll get new brakes on the other car. Seems like a thing I should do.
9812 2018-06-02 16:55:59 Hmm I think a Eau de Herschel would be a woodsy mix of motor oil, pipe tobacco, a hint of American Adjunct Lager, just a touch of powerbait and CLP or Remmoil
9813 2018-06-02 16:55:56 i heard there was doinks, riddim, n oil 
9814 2018-06-02 16:55:52 oddly enough you sure want to have our technology snorts ey no worries soon you will have your country all to yourself. no tourism no trade only what will you wear or drive in or make a cell call with. you import more oil than any developed nation you need those precious metals
9815 2018-06-02 16:55:52 Wonder if there’s any other humans out there like me—

I can’t stand the way any type of gel/slicked product feels on my scalp. Let alone my hair doesn’t support it. I  dead have to slick my hair in stages.

Flat iron/heat
Hair oil
Light spritz/holding spray.

Hair gel who?
9816 2018-06-02 16:55:47 India Consumes 4.2 Million Barrels Crude Oil Per day. With GST @ 28% Oil Rates could be decreased by Rs 30+, yet Govt can earn huge Tax to Wipe out entire Poverty of India within 5 years. Why is there no Road Map nor Intention? @FinMinIndia @PMOIndia @INCIndia @RahulGandhi
9817 2018-06-02 16:55:44 Sebenernya gitu doang kalo kataku sih sudah sangat bersih. Waktu itu temenku beli diaku trs dia habis pake biore cleansing oil coba pake micellarwater lagi biar bener2 bersih etapi hasilnya??? Kapasnya bersih coy
Jadi terbukti itu semua dosa udah kehapus cuman pake cleansing oil
9818 2018-06-02 16:55:36 A lot of countries that do it have large oil reserves, like Norway, so that they can have huge export income to cover up the loss of production their socialism otherwise creates.
9819 2018-06-02 16:55:20 My CBD oil has arrived. It tastes like a mouthful of grass clippings.
9820 2018-06-02 16:55:04 If you in Canada, say you have so much oil, then why are your gas stations selling gas at $1.40 per liter or $5 per gallon vs. our $2.75 per gallon price???
9821 2018-06-02 16:55:00 aku saranin pake produk yang kupake aja ya soalnya tipe kulit kita sama. but what works on my skin, may not works on you.

pembersih ㅡ viva

9822 2018-06-02 16:54:55 No democrat is for Big Oil and Midland is Big Oil you are pandering now..You lost my area in the primary for good reasons. Anyone that works in the oilfield that votes for you votes against their own livelihood. You do not grasp our economy here in the Permian Basin.
9823 2018-06-02 16:54:46 also one of my favorite meals rn is “toss whole broccoli heads and chickpeas in olive oil and your choice of spices and roast them at 350 for 20min”. keeps well, the broccoli is still pretty good cold

9830 2018-06-02 16:53:45 The white one is one I usually use it works better for me because it’s heavier oil than the yellow cause my hair is thicker
9831 2018-06-02 16:53:40 Tell the oil companies to stop playing games with the futures market they are steeling the tax cut from the middle class. Remember the middle class? we vote in 2020. Don't wait till then it will be to late. Get the gas prices down. Tax $$$ cut lost.
9832 2018-06-02 16:53:21 You are silent on high  crude oil prices during UPA time and low during NDA.

9841 2018-06-02 16:52:10 I got to eat them and not play with hot oil because that is fucking dangerous. Nope, not going there.
9842 2018-06-02 16:51:57 That’s BS. No D Prez would have pushed Iraq. They were forced to vote on it b/c of Bush/Cheney wanted the oil. And I lived in OR in ‘00. Nader almost cost Gore OR and WA. He had to divert resources there which could have been used in say FLORIDA!
9843 2018-06-02 16:51:42 Hmmmm, I hope this girl is made of gold or made oil or even diamonds.

9850 2018-06-02 16:50:59 No Canada does this because we play the 'long game"' you buy our lumber, oil, aluminum, etc. Because you don't have any. Because USA was short sighted and greedy and used up their resources.  We were hoping to have allies to the south that had common sense and decency Gloves off
9851 2018-06-02 16:50:53 Good move. You never know when you’re gonna need motor oil and lagostina pots at the same time.

9856 2018-06-02 16:50:23 I know, my point was that YPG let ISIS oil through to TRK. That shows the power of money, on every faction.
9857 2018-06-02 16:50:17 No, it's definitely not due to any sanctions or even a drop in oil prices, but nice try

9865 2018-06-02 16:49:28 What we really should hope to see is the rise of oil prices to a point where solar/electric, wind, geo-thermal become a no brainer alternative.

9875 2018-06-02 16:48:32 President Trump unrolled President Obama's EPA policies to bring back manufacturing to the United States.   Natural gas and oil production creates pollution and jobs.  It's a catch 22.

9883 2018-06-02 16:47:44 US wants to prevent 'goods' and food from going into N. Korea & China goes behind our backs and gives them oil, etc.  China is sneaky.
9884 2018-06-02 16:47:36 Yes! its true that crude oil prices are going up and in near future it has to go up only. But the suggestion made by you is very sad because in most of the states BJP is in power. Plus it never gave any relief to people when the crude oil prices were less.

This may not work on all skin types but Ariana revealed in an interview that she uses coconut oil to keep her skin clear. She says she uses it every night on her face,hair,body. Just try out a little bit and see if it works with your skin type or not.
9903 2018-06-02 16:45:06 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!

9905 2018-06-02 16:45:04 Basically compare the crude oil. Unpresidented fuel price hike when crude oil is unpresidented Low.

9908 2018-06-02 16:44:49 I anointed my forehead with blessed oil to keep me sane at work today. 
9909 2018-06-02 16:44:39 It would make everyone's life easier if we just sucked up the truth. Trump knows how to lie, cheat, steal and con people. He has the charisma of a snake oil salesman that suckers in the desperate looking for a cure. It's greatif you are looking for a cult leader. But nowhere else

9914 2018-06-02 16:43:55 I agree!!! That's all Canada is doing is selling off it's resources eg. wood, iron ore, oil, etc. simply because Canada topo cheap to invest in own infrastructure because the technology is US owned!!!
9915 2018-06-02 16:43:45 Seunghwa knows, like the back of his hands, the fragrance of oil color.

He knows— perhaps too well —how the canvases are sorted by their sizes in the corner of the room.

He knows how brushes are grouped, how the door makes creaking noises whenever one opens it, how the AC

9916 2018-06-02 16:43:43 Before everyone @'s me for saying "Yes, you CAN put mayo in chocolate cake", let's take a moment to analyze what mayo is.

Mayo has 3 ingredients:
1. Eggs
2. Oil
3. Vinegar

Eggs & oil are already standard cake ingredients. Vinegar is acidic-acid amplifies flavors.

Add the mayo!

9927 2018-06-02 16:42:41 CBO says economy will slow in 2019 after initial surge from TaxScam & estimated annual deficit of $1.5 Trillion maybe $2.3 Trillion 2019. Corporate CEO's say not going to hire more people after huge tax cut. Trade war will cost over hundreds thousand jobs. Oil prices up.
9928 2018-06-02 16:42:40 I need to get up and go get my oil changed and hit this gym
9929 2018-06-02 16:42:32 You think those borders are really closes? We remember the ISIS oil went even through Kurdish areas to TRK. When money is involved, a lot of principles are set aside... 1/2

9931 2018-06-02 16:42:12 #BJPKillingFarmers India is dependent on farmers. Oil will be finished within 50 yrs. Our country will survive easily because of farmers ,nuclear energy.Our farmers should be given all help.Even US gives huge subsidies to farmers.Never should we neglect our farmers.Its shameful.

9935 2018-06-02 16:41:28 favorite thing i learned on my study abroad trip: belize has put a moratorium on ALL offshore oil exploration and drilling and is planning to ban single use plastics by 2019 (in short belize is the best country thank you goodnight)
9936 2018-06-02 16:41:17 Too bad that oil tanker traffic is going to increase by 500% and finish them off. Thank the federal government's trans mtn pipeline decision & Alberta's greed for dirty oil revenues.
9937 2018-06-02 16:41:15 Finally bought an essential oil kit and diffuser

9941 2018-06-02 16:41:01 People don't want to put in the effort.
9942 2018-06-02 16:40:47 Guy at the oil changing place just tried to tell me he added power steering fluid to my car.....

9947 2018-06-02 16:40:24 If u understand the oil mkts u would have known gas would go up.. nothing to do with Trump. OPEC has been flooding oil mkt trying to hurt shale producers but couldn't sustain prices. Had to reduce production at some point which is now. However our shale will prevent prior highs
9948 2018-06-02 16:40:14 Let me correct your mispelling.  "John Brennan" is spelled "Donald Trump" who is the worst liar and criminal in history.  He should be shot, drawn and quartered and boiled in his own oil.
9949 2018-06-02 16:40:12 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
9950 2018-06-02 16:40:11 The Shaw had his faults, but he shared the oil profits with the people, and they worshipped whatever way they wanted!
When the Shia Islamists and Khomeini took over, women were oppressed under Sharia Law, and the Oil profits went to the Mulahs while the people starved!
9951 2018-06-02 16:40:10 And impose a significant price hike on oil going south of the border
9952 2018-06-02 16:40:02 Also, so the option is to just do nothing? Keep doing coal, which by the way there is no such thing as clean coal, and there are more Arby’s employees than coal workers in America. You are just fighting the big oil fight for the billionaires and getting nothing out of it

9963 2018-06-02 16:39:08 The starting eleven for this game are the same that would start our first game against Croatia. Odion Ighalo is left to perform miracles alone without the ball and a strike partner. The tactics and the players are like water and oil.  We have a 4:4:2 or 4:3:1:2 type of players.
9964 2018-06-02 16:39:00 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
9965 2018-06-02 16:38:56 I wish I could order an oil change online
9966 2018-06-02 16:38:45 Germany & France are going to get the majority of their energy needs from renewables in 20 years time. China has already invested 300 billion into renewables. If Somalia has billions of barrels of oil beneath its soil its going to stay right there for another million yrs, tragic.
9967 2018-06-02 16:38:41 have you heard of/tried oil cleansing? I’ve heard it counteracts the natural oils produced by your skin
9968 2018-06-02 16:38:40 Castor oil in soda? Why?
9969 2018-06-02 16:38:34 The oil is my must have!!! I use it when my hair is styled... dried curly or straightened. Do you have the split end mender??

9972 2018-06-02 16:37:55 Idk why, but olive oil helps my cramping. Like whenever I’m cramping, I cook food with olive oil or dip bread in it and the feeling leaves. It could be in my head? Someone try it and tell me if it works for you too lol
9973 2018-06-02 16:37:53 Well, tbf many video game characters eat roast meat they find under a smashed up phone both or an oil drum.
9974 2018-06-02 16:37:52 Try drunk elephant products. I use mostly the whole line and it’s a game changer. It’s pricey but Sephora has samples and also kits to introduce you to it. I love the cleanser and the facial oil.

9991 2018-06-02 16:35:48 It's because tech has flourished primarily in deep blue areas. Same thing with the oil and coal industries, just from the other end of the political spectrum.
9992 2018-06-02 16:35:42 The reason we study history in schools is because of John D. Rockefeller. He got 20 historians and designed history and put it into colleges. Alcohol prohibition was backed by John D. Rockefeller. He got busted because he was monopolizing oil. His net worth was 318 billion.
9993 2018-06-02 16:35:42 Nelsonville Music Fest has been super beautiful and I'm thankful to be working it but why does every french fry vendor gotta fry with peanut oil?!?! I'm jonesin' over here
9994 2018-06-02 16:35:40 ...and growing. You could actually say it is above 100, since we have large net exports on top of that. However, offshore oil platforms mostly produce their own gas power, which is not counted here.
9995 2018-06-02 16:35:37 Resorting to putting hair oil on my hands as I think oil breaks down fake tan and I don’t have any body or face oil. Yet another hand tanning fail 
9996 2018-06-02 16:35:31 Are you gonna add the whole bottle of oil again? 
9997 2018-06-02 16:35:01 People with anxiety: CBD oil is the truth
9998 2018-06-02 16:35:00 You missed the oil king!
9999 2018-06-02 16:34:54 Also oil spills in someone else's back yard are easy to dismiss when it's not yours. Coal spill from a tanker doesn't cause equal devestation.

10001 2018-06-02 16:34:42 Sitting here waiting to get an oil change
10002 2018-06-02 16:34:39 Pruitt was selected to destroy the very agency he heads. Until he's done giving our environment away to the worst polluters, i.e. Big Oil/Coal/Gas, Trump will keep him in place.

10008 2018-06-02 16:33:55 The process of destruction is as follows first humans will drill a hole for fast transportation in earths center to connect north and south pole this will lead to open lava on earths creast this will lead to burning of all oil in midel east oil will create black clouds the oil
