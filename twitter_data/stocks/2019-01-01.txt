8 2019-01-01 23:56:47 Obama didn’t start a trade war with China, Mexico and Canada. Obama didn’t add $1.2 trillion to the deficit so that billionaires could save billions on taxes, not raising employee wages and hedge fund mercenaries selling their stocks that hit a peak.  This was all Dictator Trump.
9 2019-01-01 23:56:05 Obama wasn’t POTUS in 2017 and 2018. Trump was and the stocks went up when he was POTUS.
10 2019-01-01 23:55:45 Not a valid criticism. Unless you're sitting on cash, and willing to accept a minuscule promo rate of 2% and at best staying even w inflation, you're gonna be in a mix of stocks and bonds. Trump tweeting his complaints about the Fed didn't help. Look it up on CNBC. He owns this.

14 2019-01-01 23:55:03 Your tax cut was a loan, that we will have to pay back. Your tariffs are a tax we really going to feel in 2019 and they will continue to drive stocks lower. Your an economic disaster!

I think there definitely are stores here in the UK with larger anime merch stocks but (at least where I live anyways) there is a surprising lack of Anime Merch in physical stores.

58 2019-01-01 23:46:47 I have found that time series and it isn't per capita sugar human consumption, it is "food supply quantity" which seems to be the sum of domestic production, imports and variations in stocks.

I am very skeptical using it as a proxy for sugar consumption.

66 2019-01-01 23:44:41 When you trade stocks, let your winners run and sell the losers.

Biden is the perfect choice.

Older GOP will relate with him. Young Dems stay united and follow the game plan.

Get on board Green Party. Your Putin-backed protest votes helped Trump get elected...let THAT sink in.

76 2019-01-01 23:42:50 Notice he hasn't talked stocks in a while. That was his big thing lol
77 2019-01-01 23:42:27 Sincerely, stop. Economics, stocks, the Fed, negotiation, and leadership are not your strong suits.   Really, you don’t have a strong suit.
78 2019-01-01 23:42:17 Do you think stocks appreciate oil falling 30% in weeks?
79 2019-01-01 23:41:56 Stocks in 90s and housing in ‘00s for example totally ignored rate policy from Fed.
80 2019-01-01 23:41:42 Do you think it's luck stocks are going down and feds have no pay? Pray sir for forgiveness.
81 2019-01-01 23:41:31 
82 2019-01-01 23:41:19 ES is going to open in the same relative place as the SPX. ES is the SPX underlying... the SPX can't be a certain price if the stocks in it don't get it there

it's just a matter of whether the ETH buyers or sellers get clobbered by the big money players in RTH
83 2019-01-01 23:41:00 Trump froze federal salaries that don’t keep up with inflation anyway.  Trump shut down the government so who knows when we will be paid again.  Oh, and 2018 was the worst year for stocks in a decade and the worst December since the Great Depression.  Sure, good gas prices lol
84 2019-01-01 23:40:45 2 stocks, 7 minutes, Fd, no items
85 2019-01-01 23:40:35 Stock market needs to go up and when gas prices go down so doesn't the  stocks ......not good

95 2019-01-01 23:35:09 ultimately it needs to be bot at or above in RTH. it may get moved up ETH though. this means lots of stocks got bot after hours... it has to open very close where things that make up the  index actually are.

after hours buyers aren't the strong hands usually

97 2019-01-01 23:34:54 getting more character to elite smash and I fought a laggy megaman with kirby, 3 stocks 5 mins and it was the most unfun match I played in my life
98 2019-01-01 23:34:53 Wouldn’t that also be true of most of 2018? Stocks peaked in the last two weeks of Q3 after all. I’m just skeptical of the timing, and the historic examples of other speculative bubbles tell the same story.
99 2019-01-01 23:33:23 I buy all my clothes from one store...when you're a big guy you find someone who stocks your size and stick with them,
100 2019-01-01 23:33:12 Did you notice that this was the worst year for stocks in the last decade?
101 2019-01-01 23:31:25 Stock futures open with a bang to start the new 2019 trading session. We're still  expecting stocks to test the Trump rally support level set in November of 2016. One eye on the markets the other on the #RoseBowl . #GoBuckeyes #cnbc #Bloomberg
102 2019-01-01 23:31:15 US stocks post worst year in a decade as the S&P 500 falls more than 6% in 2018
103 2019-01-01 23:31:02 The dow jones industrial will recover. If you were savvy at all, you would have been buying stocks on this dip. However, you are too busy whining about trump

106 2019-01-01 23:29:26 Stocks?
107 2019-01-01 23:28:58 @JustinTrudeau Sunny Ways!!!! CDN Stocks Close Out Worst Year Since 2008, CDN $ down 29% v USD, 4.5B pipeline to nowhere, 2018 Inflation rate est 2.3% & Federal Debt est 671B. Awesome that we will be getting more money back than we pay into the Carbon Tax starting April.
108 2019-01-01 23:28:35 Definitely want to get into stocks/ investing this year so if anyone has any tips, let me know 
109 2019-01-01 23:27:43 So are stocks. The only thing going up is Cost of Living.
110 2019-01-01 23:27:24 LOVE this!!! Now, THIS is something for our younger generations to look up to. It can’t all be about the fast life, women, cars, and jewelry. Let’s talk more about real estate, stocks and bonds. Investments in 2019!
111 2019-01-01 23:26:12 How’s the stocks Dow doing .... hmm not mentioning them
112 2019-01-01 23:25:30 ...unless you live in an oil-producing state--and the economy takes a dump. No money from gas...no value from stocks (retirement taking a dump)...what's next in your GLORIOUS bag of tricks? "Biggest depression EVER...bigger than the Great Depression--oh, the Greatest Depression!"
113 2019-01-01 23:24:23 Well actually low stocks, just like massive deficits, are now good for the economy.  Also apparently while four legs remain good, two legs are now better.
114 2019-01-01 23:23:59 Is there a reason it happened after yields had started to rise, and projected to rise further? Seems to me price of money is less relevant than speculation (same story in 90s with stocks, 2000s with housing).
115 2019-01-01 23:23:46 oh we do that but with like. fifteen stocks lmfao
116 2019-01-01 23:23:35 Low gas prices hurt stocks, stock markets, 401k, pensions, etc
117 2019-01-01 23:23:29 Trump started by banning bump stocks, he is very open to going further. 
Cheers.
118 2019-01-01 23:22:42 A degree in rocket science is not needed here.  Investors may want it to be a different story, but the bottom line is this: stock volatility was caused by lies from Trump - Stocks rose based on willful and intentional statements to suggest growth and dropped following results.
119 2019-01-01 23:22:20 Maybe it's a bust and stocks will rebound

122 2019-01-01 23:20:30 US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.
123 2019-01-01 23:20:05 What about stocks? 10 year low I believe, that’s down to you.
124 2019-01-01 23:19:59 The Dow fell 5.6%. The S&P 500 was down 6.2% and the Nasdaq fell 4%. It was the worst year for stocks since 2008 and only the second year the Dow and S&P 500 fell in the past decade. (The S&P 500 and Dow were down slightly in 2015, but the Nasdaq was higher that year.)

128 2019-01-01 23:18:02 If you are not going to pay attention to charts, then you shouldn't be investing in stocks. It is a complete cop out to say, "Well, I just buy good companies. The price swings don't matter."
129 2019-01-01 23:16:54 So are stocks and 401(k)s. At least the Deficit is WAY up!
130 2019-01-01 23:16:19 Illinois banned bump stocks too. You have to turn them in or destroy them. Because we all know if you're going to use your assault rifle you're going to follow the law to the letter.
131 2019-01-01 23:15:30 Every single one of those stocks but one tanked this year.
132 2019-01-01 23:14:37 Well since stock markets are actually ‘inversely’ correlated to real economic activity, the BETTER our economy gets, the better an environment for investment it becomes, thus ‘stocks’will continue to fall as investors chase returns in actual businesses instead of paper stocks
133 2019-01-01 23:13:49 I'm not investing there either. But I know that picking random foreign stocks is not a good strategy.
134 2019-01-01 23:13:34 when someone two stocks you in smash
135 2019-01-01 23:13:20 NO!!! We are a NET EXPORTER!!!!  

Please update your thinking!!!!!  Look at the relationship between oil prices and the stock market!!!!  Oil up, stocks up.  Oil down, stocks down!!!
 
PLEASE!!!!!
136 2019-01-01 23:12:57 It’s hard to fathom such a number... But I believe Each Of US Owe China about $10,000.00 for the #WelfareForTheRichScam Think of What Us ordinary Folks would do with an Extra $10,000.00.Lots of Us would go spend it and Zap The Economy.The rich bought Stocks,or a 3rd Yacht.#Resist
137 2019-01-01 23:12:56 I want to hear more stocks news soon.
138 2019-01-01 23:12:54 Stocks and wall street are for gamblers who try to use them to make up for living above their means. Anyone putting down the economy under Trump, thinking ongoing 1.9% growth under Obama was fine, and complaining now, are hypocrites. Plus all dems predicted recession coming
139 2019-01-01 23:12:51 MSCI Asean rose 0.5% Dec. 31 to 759.44.

Philippines 1Q CPI seen at 5%

4Q GDP Forecast Steady; China Seen at 6.4%

US stocks post worst year in a decade as the S&P 500 falls more than 6% in 2018

US crude ends 2018 down 25%, settling at $45.41, first annual loss since 2015
140 2019-01-01 23:12:35 As a value investor I understand the temptation to go against consensus. But that may be like buying newspaper stocks in 2000.
141 2019-01-01 23:12:32 The other day I was at the trans Siberian orchestra and I would occasionally pretend to check my stocks so the people behind me would think I was cool
142 2019-01-01 23:12:20 Ha what a crock. Don't try to tell me you picked random foreign stocks this year and that was your secret. You could have done the same thing with US stocks.

Nice try to impress people on the internet. Problem is, you don't know what you're talking about.
143 2019-01-01 23:11:50 @AskRobinhood Hi, I cannot purchase any stocks. I have submitted a ticket but have not received any response. I would appreciate the help

146 2019-01-01 23:09:03 Now is the BEST TIME TO BUY stocks!!!
147 2019-01-01 23:08:48 All you got left. Approval low, stocks low, gas low. Impeachment odds high.
148 2019-01-01 23:08:41 What about the stock market?  Worst year since 2008.  Your bat crazy changing your mind is sinking stocks.
149 2019-01-01 23:08:35 Stock prices are low too. 2018 was the worst year for stocks since 2008. You like to take the credit when stocks rise but then you go strangely quiet when they fall.
150 2019-01-01 23:08:33 AS THE LIBERAL BUSINESS'S WE DON'T WANT OR NEED SHUT DOWN THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUISNESSES ARE OPENING WEALTH IS BEING SPREAD. DEMS HEALTHCARE WAS PLANED TO RUIN ALL AMERICANS.

Dow Jones lost 2000 points in 2018, worst year for stocks in a decade.
But please, tell me more about the 10 cents a gallon we're saving.
153 2019-01-01 23:06:08 US stocks are down the worst since the Great Recession. This is a fact. Global stocks are also hurting, in part because of Trump’s terrible foreign trade policies
154 2019-01-01 23:05:05 Cuz the stocks are down
155 2019-01-01 23:04:41 My prediction on Iowa/ISU early NFL Draft possibilities.
  
Hockenson- Gone
Hooker- Gone
A. Nelson- Returns
Montgomery - Gone
Butler- Gone

I think Hooker and Butler are tossups but will lean towards leaving.  Hockenson and Montgomery stocks too high to return.
156 2019-01-01 23:04:17 U have the wrong end of the stick. We need to reform Bankruptcy laws & protect pensions over stock holders. U gamble when you buy stocks or invest. Win or lose your money! U devote Ur very life when U work for a pension promised, that is not a gamble, but Legal promise broken.
157 2019-01-01 23:04:01 US futures strong opening minute is a true sign of a good year for stocks in 2019

159 2019-01-01 23:03:19 Time to buy Brazilian stocks.
160 2019-01-01 23:02:42 I started trading a year ago and lost $ holding stocks. Then I ran across videos on day trading n began reading charts and making small profits. But didn’t know I needed a margin acct n was put in a 90 restriction and lost 1/2 my acct by swinging. Now I’m in 2019 free!
161 2019-01-01 23:02:00 S&P on US stocks are all down. So prove your contrary results with evidence or I’m afraid we will have to conclude your are lying, ma’m.

165 2019-01-01 22:56:43 Why wouldn’t they want an economy expanding? More money spent more taxes made. More people can invest into stocks and what not. Why wouldn’t the feds want a prosperous economy?
166 2019-01-01 22:56:23 God damn idiot. Stocks are down gas is down and you think this is winning? Hmm must be Opposite Day. When gas prices are down that’s bad for the oil business. But not only that all the industries that survive cause of the oil industries.
167 2019-01-01 22:56:23 You mean like our stocks??
168 2019-01-01 22:55:48 Stocks had their worst year since 2008. Is that okay because you liked the Apprentice?
169 2019-01-01 22:55:47 Lol...when the stocks climbed for months he had nothing to do with it,down now his fault!
170 2019-01-01 22:55:21 Good..OAN  has some intel on Los Vagus shooting that shooter had meeting with other Trump haters.Extra weapons were likely for others to shot with him. Had like 15 AR15 with bump stocks. They think other shooters chickened out. Media is no@t letting public know the truth.
171 2019-01-01 22:55:12 It ridiculous to be concerned about the state of this defense and now want a defense minded coach.  That’s like day trading stocks folks.  Get the right coach no matter what group he coaches
172 2019-01-01 22:53:57 E-commerce, dropshipping, day trading stocks, YouTube, affiliate marketing. Just some things to make an actual living off of.
173 2019-01-01 22:53:53 Mutual fund saw some gains, averaged ~11% gains, a bit above it's yearly average. Got some growth out of some small pharma stocks.

On a larger scale MSFT grew ~20%+, TWTR grew 19%+, and NFLX saw a whopping 37%. Do you even trade?
174 2019-01-01 22:53:44 lmao i love when the stocks FALL

178 2019-01-01 22:52:06 How about them stocks you used to talk about?
179 2019-01-01 22:51:59 Not if your 401K has oil stocks.
180 2019-01-01 22:51:59 We play 7 stocks over here boi
181 2019-01-01 22:51:33 Gas prices, like gold prices, are low right now because few people are speculating on them because of the overheating stock market but now stocks and shares are going to hell Wall Street will move their money into commodities like oil and gas and prices will soar
182 2019-01-01 22:51:21 who the fuck playing 7 stocks
183 2019-01-01 22:50:16 Yeah — but the stocks are going along for the ride, dude.
184 2019-01-01 22:49:45 I did read a piece on people buying up Raytheon stocks in anticipation of bombing. That’s just horrible
185 2019-01-01 22:49:03 Well if it is a consensus idea, then we should buy all the automaker stocks except those that don't make cars with internal combustion engines.
186 2019-01-01 22:48:59 Trump froze federal salaries that don’t keep up with inflation anyway.  Trump shut down the government so who knows when we will be paid again.  Oh, and 2018 was the worst year for stocks in a decade and the worst December since the Great Depression.  Sure, good gas prices lol
187 2019-01-01 22:48:58 Since we elected a #Republican president:
Stocks: DOWN
Real wages: DOWN
Inflation: UP
Interest rates: UP
Nation debt: Skyrocketing

191 2019-01-01 22:47:44 BREAKING: US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.
192 2019-01-01 22:47:39 I really wanna invest in something this year that will benefit me in the long run.. maybe buy stocks 
193 2019-01-01 22:47:26 No it won't. It means more people will waste gas and oil/gas energy stocks will continue to go down. You never look at the long-term picture, do you?
194 2019-01-01 22:47:09 It’s about money. If they don’t confirm it then their stocks won’t drop significantly because there’s no reassurance. But it’s definitely NOT because they care about their artists. Just look at the other shit they do to them
195 2019-01-01 22:46:53 And you have nothing to do with it. But you are responsible for low stocks! 
196 2019-01-01 22:46:48 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 15% Positive, with #DIVERSIFIED FINANCIALS 3% Positive. Stocks: $AVL was 22% Positive, with $SPX 0% (Neutral). #ASX

210 2019-01-01 22:43:17 Stock market is no where near shambles.  That is fake news.  The Dow is up 6000 points in 2 years.  Stocks GOP up and down.  But far from shambles. GDP is still a great indicator of economy,  which remains #1. Trump is winning.
211 2019-01-01 22:42:27 This is why so many colleges are laughing stocks.
212 2019-01-01 22:42:20 Totally agree. But I'm keeping the 50 and 200 for filtering uptrends not for intraday price action. The stocks slice through them like hot knives through butter these days and then halt at some arbitrary resistance. Some 26 year old hot shot at GS in Jersey having a power trip.

254 2019-01-01 22:15:54 Oil would have to be at a very high price to hurt stocks. Right now, low oil prices are helping the economy slightly and keeping inflation down. Oil followed SP500 this time. Put USO/SPY both on a chart and SPY clearly leads USO lower.

262 2019-01-01 22:06:03 Here are the facts: 

- Worst stock market year since 2008 Recession 
- Worst December for stocks since Great Depression
- 800K fed workers (including >200K Vets) with no paychecks
- Record trade deficit with China
- Budget deficit nearing $1T a year
- Nat’l debt approaching $22T
263 2019-01-01 22:05:09 Maybe for your stocks but not your television show
264 2019-01-01 22:04:34 Good read, can resonate with your Squirrel syndrome, perhaps I should also limit my stocks to just 2 and not flip every minute in FOMO.
265 2019-01-01 22:03:30 Y'all played no one,until LSU in which you got beat. Never were National Champions. Yall are laughing stocks
266 2019-01-01 22:00:11 There's no mistaking that Warren Buffet is a genius. How did he create so much wealth in stocks before there was an internet? He did his DD. He knew who, what, where, why and how they were going to succeed before he invested a dime. Shouldn't we if we're to be as successful??
267 2019-01-01 22:00:11 Ontario is viewed as laughing stocks, much like most Canadians view the USA and Trumplandia.
268 2019-01-01 21:59:21 Such kindness! Thank you. Nolan's supermarket in Clontarf is not far from me. It stocks gut goodies like kefir and sauerkraut and great Irish green veg. I will stock up and focus on sleep, healthy food, water and fresh air. Maybe stress, bugs and viruses will back off for a bit!
269 2019-01-01 21:59:07 and not all stocks had lousy year.
270 2019-01-01 21:57:57 Did you know Wall St. ends 2018 as the worst yr for stocks since the 08 crash? All that winning! 
271 2019-01-01 21:55:39 With the possible exception of #NFLX, all the #FAANG stocks have solid earnings, boatloads of cash, and little or no debt.
272 2019-01-01 21:52:01 While stocks might be part of the story, I’m making that claim based on a confluence of US activity indicators finally showing signs of aggregate growth finally slowing (from elevated levels) and the role of lower oil prices (and to a lesser extent wider credit spreads)
273 2019-01-01 21:51:21 Vaisu vs Robin? Vaisu 2 stocks, Robin 1
274 2019-01-01 21:51:17 PMI is a business owner survey, if they don’t understand their orderbook, production, inventory etc, who does ? But soft data has to be confirmed by hard data. And obviously PMI and stocks are leading indicators, and so are Creditspreads, yields and yieldcurve. A lot of dots
275 2019-01-01 21:48:19 nay, because tang safety does not ergonomically go with PG stocks.

277 2019-01-01 21:47:25 It'd better be better than 2018, finances wise. My stocks took a serious blow in 2018.

On a different note, 2018 was the year where I first embraced spirituality. It's all part of one same programme to liberation.

279 2019-01-01 21:45:51 a since 6 week 10% drop is stocks will swing activity that much? Especially given already low levels unlike 2014? ROW delta from 2018 depends on what ones view on Chinese stimulus and efficacy is.
280 2019-01-01 21:45:29 Blood's gross.

I'll take your stocks though!
281 2019-01-01 21:44:14 All three stocks lol
282 2019-01-01 21:43:23 Oh I know! But it's doing well so far, we haven't started giving the sheep any extra feed yet which is a bonus, especially this year when stocks are a bit low
283 2019-01-01 21:43:13 For US indices it will always be classified as dip generally. Even 07-09 looks like just a dip now in retrospect. For individual stocks not so much

286 2019-01-01 21:39:03 Never love a stock. Your loved stocks play hard to get.
Choosing whom you follow in life is important. 
Try to follow only those who improve you as a person.
Emotion is certainly the hardest thing to overcome.
Twitter is a tool – use it wisely!
287 2019-01-01 21:36:15 Exactly! Daleks became laughing stocks during the late Davies and Moffat eras because they became so underpowered and yet there were always so bloody many of them onscreen. The Daleks at their scariest is when there’s somewhere between one and a small room of them.
288 2019-01-01 21:35:51 If you're just starting to invest, then the timing of you entering the market matters. E.g. if you started investing in stocks in 2000 (like I did), that was a poor year to start. Starting in 2002 would've been 2x+ better. But timing is very very hard.
289 2019-01-01 21:35:41 Learned a great deal from last years gyrations.  The year end moves for my stocks put me in the black with a YTD net worth increase.  That being said, my stubbornness prevented me from capturing ~$250k in real profits.  I will not let that happen again for 2019.

2) Brazil supplies China with soy bean trade
3) American farmers lose beef, soy, and wheat trade
4) largest trade deal in world excludes USA
5) FED MFG Index drops worst in over a decade

295 2019-01-01 21:31:17 yeah i checked the comments and it merely just seeme people asked why or whats the point in playing on 5 stocks. but for some who said it pointed out illegitimate clips made no sense

301 2019-01-01 21:26:21 It's going to be interesting now that we have record buybacks out of way. You have to question if stocks could not rally on great earnings in 2018 what's going to be the catalyst with lower income projections. Cnbc & bloomberg shame on them for hiding the mess in the bkackground
302 2019-01-01 21:25:26 he played on like 14 stocks lmaoo, but i don't believe dillon deserves hate. it feels like he's getting upset for people merely pointing it out but id just let the kid have his fun. is justa game
303 2019-01-01 21:25:22 What you mean like this?

305 2019-01-01 21:24:43 Ok great, I thought that was the case but wasn't sure. I have several divi stocks and love to earn passive income. Great job on your December numbers and good luck in 2019.
306 2019-01-01 21:24:19 imo looking at more than 3 stocks makes me just uncomfortable, and feels kinda sus to the "clipping community" under tournament rules clips hit off skill/fundamentals in legal rule matches are so much cooler but to each their own. Had the same issue with sodrek clipping in s4
307 2019-01-01 21:23:42 The stock market only benefits the people with excess capital to invest in stocks. I've honestly seen some idiots suggest that people invest in order to get ahead, like we're just sitting on thousands of dollars with our thumbs up our asses wondering why we're poor.

 Run businesses

 Self-educate
 Listen to books
Trade stocks
 Build professional relationships
 Meditate

STFU and educate yourselves before making blanket assumptions.
311 2019-01-01 21:22:17 Sane advice, you always should disperse your picks! No matter crypto, stocks, metals....
312 2019-01-01 21:21:13 When all else fails, it’s “stock price bro.” Same argument every other Bagholder of every fraud I’ve bet against, up to #9 now with $TSLA $TSLAQ. 

PJ - What other stocks/coins look good these days?
313 2019-01-01 21:20:34 There were winners but depending on periodic comparison I guess. The gainers/losers is highly depended on when were the stocks acquired, like I have Engro @ 340 when it was thought to be really low. I’ve known people who acquired it at 500!
314 2019-01-01 21:20:06 So naturally gaming stocks are down 50%. Lol
315 2019-01-01 21:19:53 so Why the stocks P/S ratio going down？
316 2019-01-01 21:19:26 I know, that’s why I added the -equivalent disclaimer, I donate to a local org that stocks houses for recently-rehoused homeless folks. Write-offs don’t matter much anymore, given the new tax rules.
317 2019-01-01 21:19:24 I just noticed I started the year by two-stocking my cousin with Falco and taking his three stocks with spikes, WELCOME 2019
318 2019-01-01 21:17:54 Surely this is #ResignTrump' fault. After all, he banned bump stocks.

320 2019-01-01 21:16:11 And those guys were the old school. They had an actual pecking order and knew how long it took. Chris and his buddies(S1&2) just wanted what they wanted and were petty about it. It’s why they beat up that guy selling the phony stocks.
321 2019-01-01 21:15:53 It's 2019 so if you wanna squash any beef with me, 1v1 Smash, battlefield, no items and 3 stocks
322 2019-01-01 21:15:15 I think ours got rid of them in August so the stocks are low.
323 2019-01-01 21:12:56 @AP There's an accurate assessment. Judging end of year when stocks typically are trending down, discounting earlier this yr.

346 2019-01-01 20:52:57 The challenge with the predictions on the economy and stock market is that those are largely consensus opinions at this point. At the beginning of 2018 the consensus was to pile into EM stocks but it turned out to be a disastrous year for EM.
347 2019-01-01 20:51:10 I voted remain btw. Potential benefits of Brexit: Greater liklehood of lower unskilled immigration numbers under brexit leads to lower house price inflation, higher wages, more UK training & apprenticeships. Fishing stocks recover under local custodianship.

358 2019-01-01 20:42:49 Nonsense. Trump's knowledge of financial markets is far more sophisticated than most - his record (including large bond issuance and the occasional corporate bankruptcy) speaks for itself. He'd like stocks to rise, but after a 10-year bull market he knows nothing is forever.

370 2019-01-01 20:30:07 First, you’re as ignorant as Trump-any economist will tell you stocks does not indicate overall health of market conditions. Just one factor.
Second, highest and most GDP jumps between the two goes to Obama.
And third, a monkey could have continued growth. And a monkey did.
371 2019-01-01 20:29:52 You forgot to mention the record losses on stocks?
372 2019-01-01 20:29:25 Now I get it.  Your problem is staying on topic.  Banning bump stocks wasn't the topic.  You claimed CNN ignored the Republican offices getting shot at.  Someone proved you wrong, so you deflected.  I suppose I should have suspected no less from a Trumper.

375 2019-01-01 20:28:14 I am trend follower, so either I am out in couple of months or hold for years if stocks are trending well. Not a particular number as such. My average hold period for my long term accounts is 12 to 18 months.

390 2019-01-01 20:16:14 Another winner-take-all wealth redistribution:

“It certainly made most Americans poorer. While 2/3 of the corporate tax cut may have gone to U.S. residents, 84 percent of stocks are held by the wealthiest 10 percent of the population. Everyone else will see hardly any benefit.”

Brilliant tactic.

438 2019-01-01 19:40:44 No. Under Trump, since he took office, the indexes are up an ave of 11% total over approx 2 years.

As for 401ks, the average one (which contains FANG stocks & high profile tech names) is actually down 15-20% for 2018 (but up 5% overall since he took office).

463 2019-01-01 19:25:35 This ride is on a broken bumpy track.  Stocks falling, racism at its highest,  govt shutdown on your watch and your fault.  Always dividing, throwing jabs, that only your Trumpets believe. Fake news, fake president
464 2019-01-01 19:25:25 Afraid my crystal ball can't tell you whether liquidity  restored in 2019. My best guess is that the ECB pulling back from growing its balance sheet & the share buyback window closing in January will upset stocks at the outset of the year and  provide near term support for gold.
465 2019-01-01 19:24:51 But that's the point: other things than the price of money matter to risk appetite. Number one being psychology. Fed raised rates to over 5% then and stocks went up steadily
466 2019-01-01 19:23:11 Always get my head around when someone says "moneyball" because he signed a player on a free, loaned him out for couple of seasons with ludacris(yes the raper) amount of millions in fees and then sell him for x amount of millions. That's more like managing shares and stocks
467 2019-01-01 19:22:49 Another fraud hiding under the guise of religious prophet, because blind faith is like money in the bank, stocks, summer homes, expensive cars, planes, etc. And all tax free. For them.  And people ask me why I don’t “believe”.

469 2019-01-01 19:22:30 Great job on this, Justin. I think everyone was loving your spread sheet for the first 3-4 months of 2018, then it all started to go downhill for some stocks lol. Not to mention my pick got de-listed but it’s still going as a private company. 
470 2019-01-01 19:22:11 Yes. But I think that drop is pretty normal. Like stocks cannot always remain constant. Observation for now. If the stocks drop even lower, that’s a —- let’s hope, this will not become Cube 2.0 that actually leads to a lot of catastrophe shjshsjsjs PRAYERS

477 2019-01-01 19:15:52 You have done this from day one. You do it with books, businesses, stocks, countries, and, sadly, people. When you think they like you, you promote them. When you get mad at them, you eviscerate them. You are the poorest excuse for a human...let's use your term...in history.
478 2019-01-01 19:15:29 Goldman-Sachs was one of the worst hit stocks last year.  I'd bet on them to rebound if I was desperate enough for money to bet on evil.

Stocks? 

Interesting that the FED raised rates 8x ion the last two year and I believe 1x in Obama's years in office. 

It's no coincidence then that stocks will be affected. 

But people working is key.

492 2019-01-01 19:09:01 Yet stocks and the economy soared on two key dates . Election night and inauguration . Obama didn’t pass one law that helped the economy .  In fact the only major law , the ACA probably hurt it more then helped . Through 8 years it was the slowest growth in history .

495 2019-01-01 19:06:38 Yes - the portfolio is more balanced with respect to volatility risk, and it gets some exposure to the betting-against-beta anomaly when it's done with individual stocks. I don't know if it's as effective for investors who have to pay the margin rates I see advertised, though.

501 2019-01-01 19:03:43 This will increase the amour stocks rapidly! I’m buying then !! #stockstowatch
502 2019-01-01 19:03:19 Both Liverpool and Man U keepers have been laughing stocks in recent times.
503 2019-01-01 19:02:54 Which of these stocks do you think will perform the best in 2019?
504 2019-01-01 19:02:38 What about start selling @Blizzard_Ent stocks and get the hell away from that company you cost cutting and stockholder horny ones?
505 2019-01-01 19:01:58 Navrée ! Comme indiqué c'était des petits stocks mais reapproviosnnés au fil du mois... alors rdv mardi prochain ;)
506 2019-01-01 19:01:08 Even better? Stop electing people who can afford to buy stocks.
507 2019-01-01 19:00:42 Now have a small portfolio of stocks including #GGP #HUR #WSBN which are just 3 that I think will perform well in 2019. I do a lot more research and don't just jump in, and sell at a reasonable profit or a small loss, as you cannot get sentimental about the shares you hold!
508 2019-01-01 19:00:26 I learned about TA and shorted the fuck out of the S&P and various stocks. It went from a shit year to an amazing one.
509 2019-01-01 19:00:23 No one is bullish gold stocks that is for sure.
510 2019-01-01 19:00:14 Bien sûr puisque l'Allemagne nous refile ses vieux stocks pourris et que l'arme française qui aurait dû être développée ne l'a pas été.
D'autre part, on parle d'une arme de GUERRE qui doit être solide et efficace en condition de combat, pas du tir civil-mumuse.
511 2019-01-01 19:00:04 No one was buying US Steel, 
Steel mills were closing. *** 

Trump comes in, 
Puts tariffs on steel,
Tries to buy 5bn worth of steel slatted fence. 

( xxx  - you would do well to buy stocks in US Steel at this time, lets check who did.)
512 2019-01-01 18:59:34 While its historically true you often learned you were in a recession after it had started (I could give 20 historical examples), data isn’t weak enough today to suggest we are. Some solid recession indicators say not yet. But is growth slowing, YES! Stocks sniffed it out in Oct

517 2019-01-01 18:57:44 Naturally you chose the one piece of good news in this entire article.  Consumer confidence down, stocks down.  One item is significantly up, our national debt after your rich person tax failed to generate the growth Republicans promised.
518 2019-01-01 18:57:34 Lions and Cardinals are bigger laughing stocks and they’re older teams
519 2019-01-01 18:56:30 US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.
520 2019-01-01 18:54:17 Bump stocks are band Trump signed the law passed in October.
521 2019-01-01 18:53:53 Having raced street stocks on dirt for a couple years, I can say I've been in races that were huge dumpster fires. It comes with the territory.
522 2019-01-01 18:52:14 I'm not touching International stocks in retirement. Maybe BP or RDS. Only for the yield.
523 2019-01-01 18:52:10 Stocks like PBPB, SNAP and LC disappointed all investors who were impatient and thought they had to invest in these IPOs right away.  The fear of missing out on the next AMZN or GOOGL drives poor investment decisions by those who have not studied the behavior of IPOs.
524 2019-01-01 18:51:08 Great Recession planning! Are you afraid that you sold prematurely? What would you say are the top performing high yield stocks rn?
525 2019-01-01 18:49:40 I blame the players. I don’t recall a Mixon, or Perine, or Westbrook, sitting out of the Sugar Bowl in Oklahoma’s 2016-17 season when they all had locked draft stocks and were presumably “playing for nothing”. If the players wanna hurt their team by not playing, you gotta let em.
526 2019-01-01 18:49:16 1 more year and I'm child support free. I'm taking my stocks up 2 more percent afterwards. I'm retiring early you can bet that.
527 2019-01-01 18:48:31 Right with you Chris. It's tradition but so was hanging and putting people in stocks!
528 2019-01-01 18:47:48 @DA_Stockman believes stocks will decline significantly

532 2019-01-01 18:45:20 Resource stocks are on their arse but are they at the bottom? If they fall further, I fancy gold miners in 2019. If it's just a correction, any Co with cash (or able to raise easily) will do well

538 2019-01-01 18:41:39 In all seriousness, can you imagine a CEO of any major company tweeting like this? If these tweets we're coming from Tim Cook's account, what would the news be? What would happen to Apple stocks?
539 2019-01-01 18:41:25 Thanks for the great Q. You are spot on; $CIEN is technically in buy range. RS line impresses. Yet until the market shows a new confirmed uptrend, all #stocks, even Leaderboard, show a much higher downside risk. Ultimately, one should trade carefully now @IBDinvestors

585 2019-01-01 18:12:54 The republican'ts and @realDonaldTrump had 2 years to get the wall built, nothing was done. Now that it's time for @SenSchumer Pelosi get control, deals are to be made? I say bad timing. Trump and the republican'ts catered to the demonrats with bump stocks. It's bad business.

592 2019-01-01 18:10:42 It's about the direction of rates not absolute value because stocks move based on changes to underlying inputs. For example, if the risk free rate was at 20% but heading to 15% that would be very bullish for stocks

602 2019-01-01 18:05:09 Not surprised that clothing stores are doing badly. Once again M&S had insufficient sale stocks of mens' casual shirts in the largest size.

604 2019-01-01 18:04:29 That $1.3 trillion tax break for the rich, during Christmas 2017, was your wall money. Then the rich bought stocks in their companies, and left the US.

607 2019-01-01 18:01:35 These are cheap stocks that are well off their highs with strong long-term fundamental prospects. Most investors would do well to ignore the big macro picture. More often than not, the consensus macro assumptions are wrong anyway.

614 2019-01-01 17:58:19 You are babbling. How about what you have done to stocks? We were booming under Obama. Two years in and you have already had the worst year since 2008!!! What about all that winning you promised??!!!!
615 2019-01-01 17:57:53 Hopefully that will help the stocks
616 2019-01-01 17:56:58 Same here in northern parts of Ireland at the moment. Anglers are hoping for a cull! As they are devastating fish stocks.
617 2019-01-01 17:55:50 Thanks 
618 2019-01-01 17:55:44 When everything has gone to shit, you shouldn’t be asking whether you should sell. You should be asking why you didn’t sell when the market first showed that it was broken...which was many many weeks ago. Most resolute bulls always lose the most  when stocks correct. Be smart.

622 2019-01-01 17:54:26 ils font les stocks en fonction des préco. Donc si tu ne l'achètes pas là, c'est foutu (ou presque). Car ils gardent un petit stock qu'ils mettent en vente après un certain temps (donc au mieux fin d'année je dirais). Sinon faudra l'acheter à un prix exhorbitant sur ebay.

630 2019-01-01 17:49:55 Yes stocks are down 6% worst year in 10 years things are really working sad
631 2019-01-01 17:47:55 Interesting info, thanks. I do know the Chinese New Year (lunar) starting about February 5 will have water increasing and mixing quite a bit with earth. That fits. (Might also be consistent with a choppy year for stocks overall.)

641 2019-01-01 17:44:07 Yep, their cyclical analysis nailed the directional trend rate of growth. The back half of 2012 was the slowest rate of GDP growth ever without tipping into a recession. The other close recession was early 2016, which their leading indices nailed as well. And late ‘18. Stocks

651 2019-01-01 17:35:34 A reminder from yesterday: 

Under Trump and thank to him, "US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent." (The Associated Press)
652 2019-01-01 17:33:00 @BMTheEquityDesk Sir,When you develop portfolio with % allocation to each stock then while averaging would you prefer to average all stocks as per original % allocation or you would prefer to average only stock which has fallen?

654 2019-01-01 17:32:33 To some, bump stocks were stupid but you’re not seeing the message behind the ban. That ban is going to lead to a snowball effect. They start off by taking a little then they take more and then more and more until they demise it. NRA needs to step up to the Trump Administration!
655 2019-01-01 17:32:17 US stocks post worst year in a decade as the S&P 500 falls more than 6% in 2018
656 2019-01-01 17:32:17 Sure the Yanks might chip in here but seems partly due to FED and Google and Facebook etc stocks dropping due to the fact their stocks are being dumped due to their collusion with the Clinton’s evil activities.

Obama/Clinton/Dems have been up to some very bad stuff it seems.
657 2019-01-01 17:31:42 Good stuff today. There's a few energy related and  power transmission technology stocks that might be worth another look now.
658 2019-01-01 17:31:03 Someone explain to Mr. AKD the concept of economic impact of regulatory duties and utility price adjustments on households. The purchasing power for goods with fixed demand such as food items and energy is not cost elastic! Maybe you should stick to stocks!

660 2019-01-01 17:29:30 @realDonaldTrump why did you ban bump stocks?! Why are there red flag laws and one coming down the pike for federal red flag law? I have been a relentless supporter. I was trusting the plan. Where's national reciprocity?
661 2019-01-01 17:29:15 Worst year for US #stocks in a decade! Gov’t #shutdown currently crippling fed employees and their families. No AHA repeal. No #wall. And the lies! So many lies.

675 2019-01-01 17:21:13 Stocks and 401ks are the same so that's easy. No president can be blamed for a crash or fall but they do have minor and I mean minor influence on a rise. Investors control the fall through their own fears.

686 2019-01-01 17:13:15 For example, after analyzing over 1,600 IPOs from 1982 to May 2017, we learned that 11% of all stocks reached their all-time highs within 10 trading days and never went higher.  Who knew?

690 2019-01-01 17:12:24 In September 2014, 2 trader friends and I decided to study the best performing IPOs and Super Growth Stocks of all-time.

710 2019-01-01 17:05:38 This ride?

No thanks #moronTrump
711 2019-01-01 17:05:14 In reality, the drop in the FTSE is magnified by the lower value of Sterling. The companies (especially in the FTSE100 that generate more revenue outside the UK) should be showing healthy profits - and yet their stocks are still falling.

749 2019-01-01 16:43:23 As usual, the #GOP is messing up a good economy with their incompetence and greed. 2018: The Dow fell 5.6%. S&P 500 down 6.2% and the Nasdaq 4%. It was the worst year for stocks since 2008 and only the second year the Dow and S&P 500 fell in the past decade.  #Mueller will #MAGA!
750 2019-01-01 16:42:38 Tell us again that Presidents should be responsible for what happens to the markets during their tenure. In 2018: The Dow fell 5.6%. The S&P 500 was down 6.2% and the Nasdaq fell 4%. It was the worst year for stocks since 2008.
751 2019-01-01 16:42:37 Would be interesting to see what the margins are and which way they are trending. With the US equities, stocks have been coming off of record margins (another reason to be extra bearish). The number is baked into PE which doesn’t get conveyed with one single number
752 2019-01-01 16:42:25 buy pot stocks
753 2019-01-01 16:42:17 It was a fad. Buy blue chip stocks
754 2019-01-01 16:39:46 If you don't get it, let me give you an example: if you group Apple, Amazon... stocks together with a small local shop stock in your small town. Why would this little shop want to do better if at the end of the day, the other big companies drive the stock price up for it?
755 2019-01-01 16:39:05 Apple stocks are 1056.96 and they got me fucked up
756 2019-01-01 16:37:57 Stocks?

759 2019-01-01 16:36:20 Bad link ...I’ve handled and shot the MP3008 as well as examined three PG’s in unfired condition. Two had “T” type stocks and one had the skeleton stock as seen here. The privately owned PG I shot had subtle factory alterations to the chamber and a thicker barrel.

Here's the silver lining... 
WALL STREET are gonna PUMP #Crypto to the Moon
764 2019-01-01 16:35:06 But I do not think it’s constitutional to ban bump stocks from law abiding citizens who have bought them leagly. Especially without compensation
765 2019-01-01 16:34:02 For everyone saying Jennie will get kicked out: she WON'T. YG's stocks did NOT drop after the news, knetz are reacting WELL to the news, YG's known as CHILL when it comes to dating 'scandals', so calm down cause no one is getting kicked and no group disbands. Chill.
766 2019-01-01 16:33:32 Hey tRump: 2018 worst for stocks in 10 years Dow fell 5.6%. S&P 500 was down 6.4% Nasdaq fell 4%. Worst year for stocks since 2008 and only the second year the Dow and S&P 500 fell in the past decade. December was a dreadful month. Dow down 8.7% -- its worst December since 1931
767 2019-01-01 16:32:13 3 injured, no one killed.  Thankfully he wasn’t a right wing terrorist in the US with access to high capacity mags and bump stocks. Killing 60 and injuring hundreds in a few short minutes. They’re much more efficient here and they aren’t Islamic terrorists.
768 2019-01-01 16:31:23 My very simple 12-month timing model between US stocks, Intl stocks and bonds suggests 100% bonds right now
769 2019-01-01 16:31:03 However we are talking about money to fund lab studies and other research projects from Pharma which are avoidable. And it can’t be avoided then it must be declared if related in anyway to the topic. We are also talking about stocks, board membership, ad board payments.

772 2019-01-01 16:29:41 Union 1s restocked 3 times. Concords are still restocking. Bc3 released almost a year ago and is still restocking. Your point seems invalid especially when most of these static restocks are not  full sz runs but just tiny stocks of small sz’s that get a pair or 2 restocked.

779 2019-01-01 16:22:18 If trumpets voted against bump stocks and for background investigations, 100’s would still be alive! So sit down and STFU, you are one ignorant man in a pool of many.  Harp on one life when so many are dead, many deaths could have been prevented. #fuckingmoron

781 2019-01-01 16:22:03 One pundit doesn’t represent 70 million democrats who don’t want to lose jobs, see stocks decline or disappoint investorsresults. But this will happen if Trump keeps tweeting “tariff man. I love Tariffs we are taking in so much money.. Maybe we’ll triple it. We pay that 20% tax.

783 2019-01-01 16:20:05 No, Obama didn’t talk like Trump - On March 3, (2009) Obama told reporters: "What you're now seeing is profit-and-earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you've got a long-term perspective on it."

789 2019-01-01 16:16:24 And this explains why you aren't an economist. Labor is at a choke point. Worst year since 2008 for stocks. Growth can only occur when labor pool expands.
790 2019-01-01 16:16:23 What is to stop them from buying stocks next?
791 2019-01-01 16:15:45 Such as: US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.

4) Opportunistic or just buy "momentum stocks." 
5) Growth Oriented or Value Buyer.

796 2019-01-01 16:12:38 Let us see how the stock market will react tomorrow! I expect a bumpy ride! But I am not going to sell my stocks. They are all ETFs following broad indices in REITs & global stocks. I should do well. Those who time will have a hell of a time! Happy New Year!

798 2019-01-01 16:10:47 For such high profile hot stocks it is efficient . And usually expensive pricing all known info. All major hedge funds on it analyzing it day and night with lawyers. If there was such chance it would already double. The inefficiencies are in low liquidity stocks with no coverage.
799 2019-01-01 16:08:41 Yeah, you're doing great by entering the new year with a government shutdown, stocks way down, and false claims that Mexico was going to pay for the wall. Yeah great things are coming. F You! #TrumpResign

807 2019-01-01 16:01:01 The issue with discounting stocks in anticipation of recessions is timing. What do you do in the meantime? As a vanilla fund manager, you have to put money to work. If the recession picture becomes more likely they will be sold hard again.

816 2019-01-01 15:57:22 But I started investing with my own money. I have decided to stick with for 10 years. I need to run my program every month once and it gives me top 10 momentum stocks and rebalance the bucket. Each bucket holding period is 6 months. High draw downs expected.
817 2019-01-01 15:56:32 Stocks are down, interest rates are up, inflation is up, real wages are down.
We can’t wait till you’re behind bars and we have a real president again

819 2019-01-01 15:55:30 Stocks went up when trump won election. Stocks went down when trump lost half the midterms.  Stock market is dependent on trump

828 2019-01-01 15:50:44 But their intraday data is fine for high liquid stocks. Data may be wrong during high volatility as they dont capture accurate high and low during the interval.

Gotta have some appreciation for that! Don’t ya?

834 2019-01-01 15:47:35 Facebook stocks are down and will continue to fall until they do a buy back to make their numbers look good.
835 2019-01-01 15:47:26 The numbers released are off take numbers dispatched to dealers. Retail figures are usually highest in December. With high focus to liquidate stocks in current year and take minimum stock next year.

839 2019-01-01 15:45:54 “US stocks suffered the worst years since the last time we had a Republican President”<-fixed it for you. It’s ok to name facts. Like GOP economic policies led to the Great Depression, the drop in the ‘80’s, the Great Recession & now Donald.

5) don’t mess around with phase 1
6) if gunna play with microcaps, use stops 
7) think what is risk 1st vs what is gain 1st 
8) buy when trending up and use technicals to help 
9) get to know a few stocks very well and trade ranges

868 2019-01-01 15:23:29 Find stocks that rejected the October or December pullbacks in the overall market or both.  The next leaders usually hold up well during stock market corrections.  Also continue to be patient while this correction plays out into 2019.

878 2019-01-01 15:18:56 Hey stupid, what do you have to say about the economy now?!!!  You have been awfully quite lately. Maybe because, US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.
879 2019-01-01 15:18:24 The first thing to go when a company's stocks drop are jobs! I know from experience. Gotta keep the stockholders happy.
880 2019-01-01 15:18:02 MSNBC:
US stocks conclude 2018 with the major stock indexes posting worst yearly performances since the 2008 financial crisis.
881 2019-01-01 15:17:51 Stocks suffer worse loss since 2008!!  Tell federal employees how great everything is!!  Trump is teaching you to lie very well!!
882 2019-01-01 15:17:36 Most individual stocks are in a bear market, let alone the indexes.  Many advisors would be in the same boat.

899 2019-01-01 15:08:57 With two stocks its not as fair as 3 stocks because moves do much more damage and people die earlier. Giving 3 stocks gives wiggle room for each person to take back the game. With two stocks whoever gets the first stock pretty much wins

919 2019-01-01 14:56:23 More important - to invest in stocks they receive inside information about by virtue of their office, !!whether or not!! they pass legislation that affects it. 
This really needs to be better understood as a way they can feather their nests.
920 2019-01-01 14:55:03 More conservative states should put the federal bump stock ban on their next ballot and if the people vote to keep bump stocks legal the state should keep them legal regardless of what the federal law is.

927 2019-01-01 14:50:19 Face it, Donna. @realDonaldTrump doesn't work. After 2 years, there is NO wall, NO ACA repeal,  NO infrastructure, NO middle class tax cut, NO deal with China, and stocks have tanked. He plays golf 4 days a week, can't read and is incapable of making a deal. #MAGA

966 2019-01-01 14:24:29 With cap-rage like that, stocks will drop even further the day after new year. Thanks Trump, for crashing the market—you own this one too. like the Government Shutdown.
967 2019-01-01 14:24:15 So sorry for your loss. Time to get serious about limiting access to military type guns, ammo, clips, stocks and whatever we are able. Guns in every house made sense when the US was filled with hostile natives and wild animals. No longer!
968 2019-01-01 14:24:02 2018 has been the worst year for stocks since 2008.  USA is UGELY divided.  Our allies are all pissed off at us. We are friends with dictators murderers and thug countries.  The debt is sky rocketing and the deficit is even worse.   All in all you have made the country worse.

985 2019-01-01 14:15:26 All non dividend paying stocks are inherently a Ponzi scheme. No one can make money without a greater fool. We are witnessing the end of the baby boomer bubble/Ponzi. Ergo, your floor is not low enough.
986 2019-01-01 14:15:17 To be honest, I think my investment success matches most others. Those moonshot stocks that were rocketing upwards just lost me money in the end, while boring companies that just churned out cash year after year became my big winners over time.

1004 2019-01-01 13:58:08 One take is relative, ie quality companies in the US are typically more attractive than foreign quality companies.  

Montier’s take is from an *absolute* perspective, ie what should we expect from stocks in general. You said the take was “insane”. Wondering why specifically.
1005 2019-01-01 13:56:51 Stocks is the greatest. I’d brush my teeth with it if I could.........hmmm
1006 2019-01-01 13:56:37 Race card pulling. Modern day equivalent of finding a handy villain to throw in the stocks in order to mock and throw rotten fruit at. Helps the fruit chucker feel superior and righteous.

1011 2019-01-01 13:51:59 Sensex is just the indication of 30 stocks and not the business activity or the whole country. It doesn't take the account is small business activity of small companies. So don't give these jumlas to us . Say this to urban naxals they might buy Ur stories.

1013 2019-01-01 13:50:13 Lol, ridiculous. tRump brought his own swamp. Manufacturers closing plants, stocks in the tank, govt shutdown, endless scandals, he is friends with our enemies, US is a laughing stock of the world.
1014 2019-01-01 13:49:01 When her stocks went sky rocket
1015 2019-01-01 13:49:00 Your president just banned bump stocks and it’s more than President Obama did in his entire 8 years...   trump is taking your guns faster than President Obama did
1016 2019-01-01 13:46:27 I got 0.2% on my savings account, which is somehow still considered decent. Inflation rate is like 10 times that. Without investing into stocks, there's no chance for proper interest anymore. And with the -5% the market took in 2018, I guess having money means you're screwed.
1017 2019-01-01 13:46:21 Hahaha. Amman ate, adda lang dagitay adda issue na nu apay adot stocks mi nga agas jay treatment room   HAHHAHA

1024 2019-01-01 13:43:10 Really?   Lying already in 2019.  Are you ignoring as usual the booming economy?  The fact the stocks soared to record highs?   Unemployment lowest in decades?   Millions of jobs created?  2018 was a great year and Trump continues to keep his promises.  Reality check.
1025 2019-01-01 13:42:51 US stocks post worst year in a decade as the S&P 500 falls more than 6% in 2018. I love winning?????

1031 2019-01-01 13:37:13 On one hand, they argue that US stocks are perilously expensive (Montier), but in the GMO post on US quality, they argue US quality valuations are 1) justified, and 2) attractive, whereas EM in this case is not.
1032 2019-01-01 13:37:08 Well you let us down with the bump stocks...another mistake like that could cost you the entirety of your base.
1033 2019-01-01 13:37:04 bad link
1034 2019-01-01 13:36:03 You can adapt to anything. You dont need money also. You can beg too. Thats not the point. NPV of money is net of inflation and returns from stocks or FDs across time. You cant selectively tell stories.
1035 2019-01-01 13:35:25 That’s good to know. I’ll plan a visit once I run a bit lower on stocks . Relieved to hear I don’t have to wait until December.

1040 2019-01-01 13:31:14 When REALITY isn't what Trump expected, he won't change his expectations, HE CHANGES REALITY:
Fences are called walls.
$25B Wall is called keeping a campaign promise.
Bump stocks are called machine guns.
Legal searches are called break-ins.
Fox and Friends is called news.

1052 2019-01-01 13:24:06 To add to this, the choice was to not charge consumers extra because of higher taxes on sugar but now they're forking out more for old stocks of the classic recipe than if you guys just upped the price.

It is weird though that there's still loads of the old stock 
1053 2019-01-01 13:23:26 Are you complaining because you didn't look at ta and pull out? I bought a couple stocks the last 2 nights and I'm up slightly. Also, markets have cycles and exhibit fractals, so pinning the performance down turn to trumps policies is really silly. 1/2
1054 2019-01-01 13:23:26 Just a heads up: The DOJ made bump stocks illegal to own and if you have one you can be charged with a felony.

1078 2019-01-01 13:05:58 Taking profits from stocks that increased in value is smart. 

It's smart if you re-invest later when stocks are down.

If you sell and use the proceeds for vacations, you may learn what "running out of money" means.

1079 2019-01-01 13:05:51 2018 was awful for gaming PCs. High prices on memory, GPUs, criptomining drowning stocks, expensive CPUs and a new GPU generation that brings nothing to real gamers. I hope new year will bring you a pair of cleaner glasses.

1360 2019-01-01 07:44:50 Best top up cocktails and check ammo stocks. Lol 
We're close to 2019!
1361 2019-01-01 07:44:34 Stocks
1362 2019-01-01 07:43:18 yg stocks are going down oh no
1363 2019-01-01 07:43:06 The government is shut down because of ignorant RW personalities, 2018 was worst year in stocks in a decade, our allies don't have faith in or trust us, Russia & China are making some serious expansion moves, the planet is dying, etc. - but sure, we're great "again".
1364 2019-01-01 07:41:42 64 is so much faster paced that its played competitively with 5 stocks
1365 2019-01-01 07:41:17 4.0 gpa, more investment return in myself/stocks, and be stage ready for 2020 are the only things I’m focusing on this year. Everything else can wait.
1366 2019-01-01 07:40:19 2019 stocks.
1367 2019-01-01 07:39:40 YG's stocks are falling down ! OMG ! :(
This is a bad sign !

1368 2019-01-01 07:38:51 @realDonaldTrump It only took 2 years for Trump to destroy a decade's worth of economic prosperity under President Obama. 2018 stocks officially down over 6% year over year.  Trump destroyed the economy like he destroyed so many of his businesses. #ImpeachTrump #LockHimUp
1369 2019-01-01 07:37:03 Oh yes he is poorer, a lot poorer, than he ought to be given the head start he's had in life. but money is all he ever talks about, the Dow, the stocks, and getting the better of someone, anyone, Obama, Dems, Mexico, NATO, in fact anyone except Putin!
1370 2019-01-01 07:36:44 I got into a twitter fight with a kpop fan and had to spit out facts about stocks and ramifications and breach of contracts and citing it (screenshots). It’s 2am let me sleep you crazy Blackpink fans. It’s the first day of 2019 and y’all have me write like its a school essay
1371 2019-01-01 07:34:57 Since the markets were untradeable for most of 2018 I spent my time doing other things, one of them being declutterring and minimizing my existence and belongings. Now, I want to do the same thing with my trading. I want to identify a handful of stocks and get to know them well.
1372 2019-01-01 07:34:43 I'm happy for them but I'm a lil disappointed to Jennie. They should be more attentive. Chu, Chae, and Lisa will suffer also because of Jennie's involvement and also YG stocks (I saw some pic that YG stocks decrease!?)
1373 2019-01-01 07:32:26 They have passed allot of gun control laws across the USA. The DoJ is going to start going door to door looking for bump stocks in March. If that that clause is removed.
1374 2019-01-01 07:30:19 This Year may your hair and teeth, your face-lift, abs and stocks not fall, may your blood pressure, your cholesterol, white blood count and mortgage interest not rise. Happy New Year!

1375 2019-01-01 07:30:02 "US stocks post worst year in a decade as the S&P 500 falls more than 6% in 2018" Hmmm
So we have not seen any pain in 10 Yrs - be prepared...

1381 2019-01-01 07:26:16 Stocks are going to go up soon. Annoying Trump/gas stocks this year. We need to set a realistic cap on how much we are spending on refugees each year...
1382 2019-01-01 07:26:07 I did not move the goalposts. It is like “oil companies depreciate their stocks” — well, every business does. 

I’ll make you a deal. It is very late where I am (Happy New Year, by the way). Send me info about the subsidy and I will happily read it later today. 100% sincere.

1384 2019-01-01 07:25:00 Themes for 2019: Like commodities especially Gold & oil stocks at current levels $poly $CEY $HUR $pmo.  Royalty Co. $APF general fund $CYN and Uranium fund $GCL offer good risk to reward. $BMK, $nsf $opti offer diversification & growth in what will be a volatile 2019.  GLTA.
1385 2019-01-01 07:24:34 A lot of assumption, no proof. But if you are so sure about it, you probably are invested into the same stocks too. Or not? 
1386 2019-01-01 07:23:26 I wasn’t discounting your thesis but rather agreeing with you . A V shape recovery is possible for most stocks but it rarely happens. Perhaps , you misunderstood my intention. My third tweet in the new year should not disqualify me from my resolutions , eh ! Cheers!
1387 2019-01-01 07:22:31 Long term yearly gain is ~11-12%. Stocks were trading at ridiculously high multiples & earnings values. Worry about the 1/2 of the nation that can’t afford to be invested. Real wages haven’t risen in 40 years. Once, we taxed the hell out of the wealthy & corps & all prospered!
1388 2019-01-01 07:18:09 En 2019 les choses vont réellement commencer car avec les fêtes de fin d’année Macron a bénéficié d’une accalmie salutaire. A partir d’aujourd’hui le mouvement des gilets jaunes va passer à la vitesse supérieure : préparez vos stocks de boites de conserve et bouteilles d’eau
1389 2019-01-01 07:17:38 2018 was historic for stocks. The Dow fell 5.6%. The S&P 500 was down 6.2%. The Nasdaq fell 4%. It was the worst year for stocks since 2008 and only the second year the Dow and S&P 500 fell in the past decade. So much winning!

1400 2019-01-01 07:08:35 What makes 5 stocks sus? Like some people just prefer longer games
1401 2019-01-01 07:07:27 if we look at mid cap n small cap stocks..lots of them are on verge of break out ....so probability of very good broader market
1402 2019-01-01 07:03:06 First new thing of 2019 i learned today was that Disney owns roughly 80% of ESPNs stocks.
1403 2019-01-01 07:02:29 Bump stocks are illegal now. If, for some reason, you have one already in your possession, you have 90 days to turn it in to ATF or destroy it.
1404 2019-01-01 07:01:28 Last few years we saw massive road building , yet Cement stocks went no where 
Thing is biggest market for Cement is Real estate /construction. To be bullish on Cement in India is about being bullish on RE (In my view)
1405 2019-01-01 07:00:59 Beat my brother in Smash Bros after going down 3 stocks. I told him “Call me LeBron I bring it back from a 3-1.” He isn’t talking to me.

1411 2019-01-01 06:53:54 Let's hope for a better year!

US stocks suffer the worst year since the 2008 financial crisis
1412 2019-01-01 06:53:08 It’s not concern about the account type, but the proposed underlying investments. It’s hard to see how Warren’s proposed Accountable Capatalism Act doesn’t result in a significant devaluation in stocks and thus the retirement accounts that hold stocks.
1413 2019-01-01 06:53:00 Smash-related things I wanna do in 2019:

• Post about tournaments on Twitter more
• Beat an actual good player in bracket
• Take a game off @WeSSlowDancer’s Richter without him SDing all three stocks
1414 2019-01-01 06:52:17 A monkey throwing darts at a list of stocks could have beaten Einhorn’s return!

1420 2019-01-01 06:45:56 Not to happy with the medical marijuana stocks lately. I was reading tilry and A.B. are working on a non alcohol cannabis beverage. Gotta change with the times. What are your thoughts,on the stabilization of the medical  cannabis industry?
1421 2019-01-01 06:43:36 stocks rise by 1%.
1422 2019-01-01 06:42:47 I don’t think you are serious ! Why would it be a V shape recovery when stocks simply don’t trade in this manner, sans a few with catalysts. No it will be just as rough whenever the recovery begins. First, we have to flush before an uptrend can even begin.
1423 2019-01-01 06:36:32 Which are leading stocks in this sector?
1424 2019-01-01 06:34:50 2018 was the worst for stocks in 10 years @realDonaldTrump happy new year
1425 2019-01-01 06:34:31 I hear in 2019, they’re going to bring back the stocks and pillory. Instead of throwing cabbages at your head when you’ve been bad, instead you’ll be forced to listen to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez @AOC and her policies.
1426 2019-01-01 06:33:15 @realDonaldTrump @GOP I just heard that stocks closed out the worst December since 1931.
Just thought you should know. My 401k is just about dead. Thanks.

1435 2019-01-01 06:25:08 Stanley druckenmiller was also complaining same thing about US stocks and games that algos play because of which usual logic doesn't work in short term.

May be same algos are deployed here to cause chaos and make money for them.
1436 2019-01-01 06:24:57 pharma especially biocon kinda stocks ..auro etc. u see its correlated to US pharmas  and the bull mkt of debt helped them climb this from 1994 . thats unwinding// same year viagra was discovered may be this will be unwind of that bubble

1455 2019-01-01 06:02:44 dude I just played a really good Wario, but I played really campy and patient and I ended up winning even though I was behind the entire game. Seriously, NEVER give up. Even when you’re at kill % on your lat stock and they have 3 stocks, you can still win
1456 2019-01-01 06:01:34 4 stock 8 min is Melee. Each game has their own competitive ruleset. Melee is super fast, which is why they put 4 stocks to make matches last longer. Smash 4 is much slower than Melee, which is why its 2 stock, so its not as drawn out. Ultimate is faster than 4 but slower than M
1457 2019-01-01 06:01:32 Akshay bhai money is that easy to make
 What you have to do is spot the trend and long or short stocks in that direction 
 Use any tool or indicator to find stocks just manage risk and rest will be fine 
@Amit_Gulecha
1458 2019-01-01 06:00:54 How I see it.
3 stocks: no problem
7 minutes: [only a pain I see if you face a projectile spammer for that long]

Omega or Battlefield: Personally I prefer Omega, Platforms so far for me have been annoying

No Items: Unless it's fun with friends Items should be Off.

1468 2019-01-01 05:58:44 But nothing about universal background checks, bans on violent offenders and the mentally ill owning, extended magazines, required safety training, mandatory insurance, limits on ammo, banning bump stocks.
Or anything that would actually lower gun violence.
1469 2019-01-01 05:55:38 YG stocks went down wtf
1470 2019-01-01 05:55:20 Commodity stocks command a set PE that ranges between 5 and 10. Paying anything more than this is a sure sign of getting trapped.

These are simple business depending upon the price of the commodity and the mgmt expertise to the company, no competitive advantage or moat.

All trumps whining.....
1479 2019-01-01 05:49:00 LIES. Everything you said is wrong, pay is not up, you started a shutdown, you froze federal workers pay, lied to the military about raises, stocks fell the most in Dec since 1933, got rid of regulations that protect us, and you took children from parents. Nice accomplishments.

1538 2019-01-01 04:50:38 That’s total bullshlt. If you invest in the market there are no guarantees. President Trump’s policies raised the market. It’s reacting to the rate hikes. Blame the Fed. Buy cheap stocks now and stop crying.

1743 2019-01-01 02:33:40 So you want him to care about something that is the States responsibility, care about something he put a panel on and had parents and meetings about, banned bump stocks, has wage growth going, revamped VA, and he’s done all he could for gov workers.  But yeah.  He doesn’t care.
1744 2019-01-01 02:32:39 hey guy, i just started following you cause is see you on tv, but, you never talk stocks on twitter, just sports and stupid stuff.  so if i want to read your stocks insight should i go elsewhere?
1745 2019-01-01 02:32:04 US stocks suffered worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent. You're not getting a wall either.
1746 2019-01-01 02:30:26 Manipulated stocks and short selling by using media the short sellers control to sow chaos while they cash in.
W/o thinking the addicted and stoned play their pawns.

1758 2019-01-01 02:23:11 U.S. Market Check

    U.S. stocks ended the worst year since the financial crisis with a narrow gain in thin pre-holiday trading.
    The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell three basis points to 2.68 percent.
1759 2019-01-01 02:22:58 Stocks around the world limped into the end of a dismal year that’s seen bear markets in equities from Japan to Germany.
1760 2019-01-01 02:22:36 Sacrifice,are you delusional?! The only one that’s sacrificed anything is the American people,farmers going broke,plants closing by the dozens,800,000 people can’t get their pay check,stocks worst in a decade,put the bottle down,its eating your brain,
1761 2019-01-01 02:20:49 I’ve just spent the last 2 hours of my life watching videos about how stocks work and the stock market and I think I’m a genius! Happy New Year

1767 2019-01-01 02:16:37 its all fun until the stocks drop which i predict is happening as we speak
1768 2019-01-01 02:15:32 Stop and think about all the shares sold this past 50 days. Trillions of $$. We have had the most gains in the past 26months. Stocks sold, sold at a profit. That profit goes into pockets and when you take profits, you pay capital gains. WIN-WIN

this time it's the other way around.
Trump is the one stuck on the Titanic with no life vest,
He lost the Congress.
1773 2019-01-01 02:13:34 Ok. Did you get the wall, excuse me fence? Did Mexico pay? Is Isis gone? How’s that brand new health care plan? Did you get the middle class tax break? How are your stocks and 401k doing? Tell me again how you’ve been winning? I’m waiting...

1775 2019-01-01 02:09:20 How’s your 401k?  The worst yearly decline for stocks since 2008. All three major indexes finished in the red during the finale of a tumultuous year. The Dow Industrial Average and the S&P 500 recorded annual declines of around 6 percent each.
1776 2019-01-01 02:09:04 2019 brining in New stocks , New , New , New , New , New everything like the late Bankroll Fresh said Streeeeeeeet!!!
1777 2019-01-01 02:08:14 Everyone is aware that the stocks a low but it’s no excuse for selecting a test opener with no technique or first class opening experience, let alone the continual Mitch Marsh fiasco
1778 2019-01-01 02:08:09 I could play with one hand and still get two stocks
1779 2019-01-01 02:05:49 Really? U.S. Indexes Close With Worst Yearly Losses Since 2008
Stocks rise on the year’s final trading day, but not enough to offset bruising last few weeks of selling.

1786 2019-01-01 02:03:01 As 2018 ends there’s a couple things that I accomplished and somethings that I didn’t. I got a car (kinda), and started investing in stocks but I failed in staying consistent with reading, workouts, meditation and streaming. So in 2019 I will work on all these and more.
1787 2019-01-01 02:02:51 give us back bump stocks
1788 2019-01-01 02:02:48 In fairness, you have to look at the growth in stocks over a longer period than one year!
1789 2019-01-01 02:02:14 you know those people who don't understand the stock market and how there has to be someone to like, want buy the stocks you're selling. that's what i feel like whenever i sell a nocturne egg in like 5 min for 200k. who buys this shit

1794 2019-01-01 02:00:45 Nikkei? 
ASX? 

And when you decide to invest is very important - go in days before a 20% drawdown and 2% outperformance is cold comfort

For several years now, I have invested in stocks, bonds, and funds seeking growth. Things haven't been good as of late.
What is your current prediction for 2019? Will it be a good year to invest in additional securities?

DM me your response.
Thanks.
1815 2019-01-01 01:44:33 The worst yearly decline for stocks since 2008 is your fault, not the Fed. Heed your own advice and resign now!

1837 2019-01-01 01:29:26 thx @davidbcollum @sunchartist Don't bring an economist to a stock market fight. Economists don't predict economies well, stocks do. You can go long and short stocks not the economy. #BakesTakes_
1838 2019-01-01 01:29:10 Stocks have been sliding since before the midterm.  And we're on our way to a trillion dollar deficit because of the tax scam...
1839 2019-01-01 01:29:08 Americans shrugged as 2018 drew to a close, a bad year for stocks, a tax cut that failed to pay for itself, a Trade War killing the heartland, Car and machinery plants shutting down, inflation up. no end in sight for the government shutdown, trade deficits. Bleak, very bleak.

1852 2019-01-01 01:17:09 Why is it a joke? Elaborate. 1) it has 0 commission . Because of that we can buy stocks in layer. Why pay b.s commison ?  2) option is easier . 3) great for part time traders . @jennyvarela1 @RobinhoodApp

1864 2019-01-01 01:11:48 Beef has become an occasional luxury for me, rather than a regular meal---restricted to trips to BBQ pits & a few ribeyes a year. I'm mostly pescatarian now, although that presents problems of its own like overfishing & declining stocks.
1865 2019-01-01 01:11:20 Agreed! What I'm wondering is why do gun illiterate people think they know what should be banned or allowed? There was a large uproar to ban bump stocks but many couldn't define what they are. Same with ARs. People get caught in sp00ky rhetoric rather than effective policy.
1866 2019-01-01 01:11:09 Wait... the CDC Director resigns for buying tobacco stocks

1877 2019-01-01 01:04:35 Is this true or not
The Dow fell 5.6% The S&P 500 was down 6.2% and the Nasdaq fell 4%. The worst year for stocks since 2008 and only the second year the Dow and S&P 500 fell in the past decade. The S&P 500 and Dow were down slightly in 2015, the Nasdaq was higher that year

1934 2019-01-01 00:40:54 It’s odd considering what he did last season. He’s definitely a guy who relies on athleticism. They’re counting on him to score more now so that might have a bit to do with his lack of stocks. Plus, he’s still getting his conditioning back. I think he’ll get them back up.

1985 2019-01-01 00:10:12 YO, my fiancé LOVES the orange Rockstar Recoveries. It's all he drinks in the morning. Every time there's a 10-for-$10 sale, he stocks up.
1986 2019-01-01 00:09:21 The focus of 2019: My little family, career, pursuit of a Masters in Business, fitness, health, travel, finance, investment in stocks, save for a house before 30. 
1987 2019-01-01 00:08:08 President Trump elected stocks rise to all time highs! Extreme Democrats take House stocks nose dive!
1988 2019-01-01 00:07:59 smh oh boy know what’s gonna happen in 2019... RT @AP: BREAKING: US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.
1989 2019-01-01 00:07:57 2018 was the worst for stocks in 10 years. 2019 America it’s Time for a major #change... #Happy_New_Year_2019
1990 2019-01-01 00:06:21 Under Dump, US stocks had their worst year in a decade. The DOW and S&P had their worst years since 1931 (during the Great Depression).

Looks like having a failed businessman in the White House isn’t such a hot idea.
1991 2019-01-01 00:06:07 I think I'm done arguing now. The grammar police are knocking at my door. If you need me, I'll be in the stocks.
1992 2019-01-01 00:05:37 US stocks conclude 2018 with the major stock indexes posting worst yearly performances since the 2008 financial crisis.
1993 2019-01-01 00:05:29 For 2018, the U.S. #PermanentPortfolio finishes down 1.72%. Stocks, bonds, & gold all down on the year. (Only other time that’s happened was 1994.)

VTI -5.23% #stocks
TLT -1.61% #bonds

BIL +1.74% #cash

1995 2019-01-01 00:04:40 Stocks End it’s Year The Worst Since 2008
1996 2019-01-01 00:04:39 These thinly traded stocks are definitely hard to purchase without moving them. When their time comes it will be epic. To 2019! 
1997 2019-01-01 00:04:23 Trump took credit when stocks rose, he needs to take credit for worst decade ever! Sorry, he cannot have it both ways! And any delusional followers think so are wrong !
1998 2019-01-01 00:03:58 there is money to be made in the stock market. AIM is tough to crack and a lot of it is about risk management, timing and taking profits.  Try trading stocks in the FTSE 250 so many opportunities out there.. all the best for 2019
1999 2019-01-01 00:03:53 Pretty sure this has already happened to lots of the ASX-listed pot stocks? Most of them got absolutely caned in 2018.

2005 2019-01-01 00:02:09 I think Stocks will skyrocket again like they did after Trump’s election/Passing of Tax Bill when Trump goes to Davos in January and China Deal is finalized in a few months.
