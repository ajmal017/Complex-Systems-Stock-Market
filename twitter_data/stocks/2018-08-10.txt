14 2018-08-12 23:39:04 Interesting week next week with some big Dow components and lots of retail stocks reporting earnings! I think this week will be a lot more volatile than last week's snoozer.

19 2018-08-12 23:34:04 I’m not sure your level in stocks, but whatever your P/L’s are in stock trading, it could be double that pretty easy with the leverage for a simple answer. So if your not making profits in stocks, it will be worse here. Options can change your life quick lol.

40 2018-08-12 23:33:11 Fighting for what? For senators to be able to use their seats for personal wealth by voting on personally owned stocks? Fighting to poison our BWCA with copper mining to please your polynet donors? Fighting to debate. Ha!

43 2018-08-12 23:28:36 No not really. Trading and how stocks move is the same for options, except it has a lot more leverage. For me it’s just terminology and getting the feel for buying & selling the call & puts. I do remember looking at Skyview trading & tasty tricks if I remember the names correctly
44 2018-08-12 23:28:15 "Consumption market of last resort" - how?  Under USD-centric system, US consumes more only when global CB's lend to US to consume...& they haven't done so in 4 yrs.  Only way US consumption can rise is via weaker "USD/rising rates/rising stocks" combination of the US Trilemma.

47 2018-08-12 23:26:00 Weeklies are only worth it on stocks with really low premiums like $BAC. I'll toss in 30 dollars and get 5 contracts and if I'm wrong, whatever I only lost 30 dollars. But if I'm right, the upside is endless.
48 2018-08-12 23:22:11 I couldnt beat his ness was taking stocks was fun
49 2018-08-12 23:21:49 I believe it is known the “fees” or revenue come from loaning out the stocks mainly to hedge funds selling short and other investors. There are several basis points or more in interest made from stock loans. I don’t believe they are keeping this quiet.
50 2018-08-12 23:20:58 @TinaSmithMN Tina your commercials are such a joke You don’t even support single payer and are rolling around in the swamp with this medical device stock. We don’t care how personally wealthy you are, just earn it like everyone else instead of voting on YOUR stocks in senate

69 2018-08-12 22:52:46 I like to think that the strong-willed stubbornness is actually determined leadership in training. It helps me navigate through my frustrations a little better. But, oh, it is so hard sometimes to not just want to put everyone in stocks and be done for the day. 
70 2018-08-12 22:51:56 They're invested in stocks and stuff, don't get me wrong.

77 2018-08-12 22:42:05 <@360287559227539468> stocks now are $T+2 they changed it. So after selling a stock you can use that money again after 2 days
78 2018-08-12 22:41:52 That comment shows inexperience and immaturity about the crypto space. So are u saying there is NO volatility in stocks or paper money? No volatility in Facebook, or Tesla, or Turkey Lira, or Venezuela, etc? Atleast with Bitcoin there is no CEO, no dilution, no central control.
79 2018-08-12 22:41:10 And you can't even order them all from one place because who actually stocks what is a lottery.

81 2018-08-12 22:36:20 Stock market value is linked to confidence.  Sounds too simple to be true, but it is.  If China decided to dump US treasury notes, that would scare the crap out of people and they'd dump US stocks and the market would nosedive.
82 2018-08-12 22:36:13 ".. US buybacks could total as much as $1.2tn for 2018. That would lift the total since 2010 to over $5.1tn, bigger than the Fed’s entire $4tn quantitative easing programme. In fact, companies themselves have been the single biggest buyers of stocks since the financial crisis."
83 2018-08-12 22:35:55 That money will be gone in 2 years.....People don’t know how to manage it....Hey dude invest 40% in stocks and 30% in savings.
84 2018-08-12 22:35:37 It’s facts.
85 2018-08-12 22:34:46 that’s your opinion, but go off 
86 2018-08-12 22:34:32 Why trade stocks when you can trade silly bandz?
87 2018-08-12 22:34:02 And wrong lol

89 2018-08-12 22:32:24 While people are worrying about getting new cars (which is dope don’t get me wrong) I want to research more about how to decrease my student loan debt, increase my credit score, invest in stocks

94 2018-08-12 22:27:44 I don't have an archived version to compare against, so I'm not 100% sure.. But I do see that other Nasdaq stocks say Home Market as Nasdaq (and NYSE as NYSE) as one would expect.
95 2018-08-12 22:26:33 Gaslight Trump -

If you lived in the real world, you would know that very few people have pensions these days.  

And less than 50% of Americans own stocks.

96 2018-08-12 22:26:22 @dixielee1969 Tks.  I have a 7 min timer to keep from trading at open & beginning to think that is not good when you have hot stocks moving fast at the open.  Waiting 7 min has meant $ lost in fast market.  What say you?
97 2018-08-12 22:26:09 The guy who came up with the formula for GDP did not think stocks should be included as "productive" economic activity, because it is not at all productive for the economy when Dick sells his stock to Harry.

100 2018-08-12 22:23:56 Trading stocks started with the trading of tulip bulbs in Holland.
101 2018-08-12 22:23:14 This calf was actually stillborn. A 3yo in the same group was injected with broad spectrum antibiotics this week. Salmon stocks are down and these whales are truly struggling. Very sad.

105 2018-08-12 22:18:57 What stocks are you guys watching this week? I just might to a live webinar reviewing them
106 2018-08-12 22:15:58 Heard an analyst say #socialmedia is strong on raising alarm but not following it up with solutions/positive progress. Really?

107 2018-08-12 22:14:28 I was shopping for stocks to buy the other day and came across 21st Century Fox. I definitely avoided them. We need to lead a campaign to inform people that they need to quickly sell their stocks. That should hit their stock price. Hannity and Ingram will be a history afterwards.
108 2018-08-12 22:12:07 this wouldn't be as big of a deal with 3-4 stocks imo

2 stocks is probably the worst thing about smash 4 competitive

besides bayo and lylat that is
109 2018-08-12 22:10:21 It is odd, so I'm not drawing conclusions, but could reflect a change in a database somewhere.  If you look at other cross-listed NASDAQ stocks (eg ATTU, on Berlin as ATTUNITY), they say NASDAQ.
110 2018-08-12 22:10:12 Whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like to go to avoid the labor of thinking.
111 2018-08-12 22:08:47 "stock prices of European banks, which have been big lenders to Turkish banks, dropped over fears of Turkish corporate bankruptcies. The currencies of China, Brazil and Mexico also weakened, and U.S. stocks fell before recovering"
112 2018-08-12 22:07:27 Holds are pretty rekt. So moving degeneracy onto the stocks. Some short sp500 with SDS and some HMNY cuz pennyshitstockyolo
113 2018-08-12 22:06:29 Couldn't individual state pass requirements that you cannot be on the ballot for president or congress without first selling all your stocks? That would cut down on some of this.

115 2018-08-12 22:05:00 as per Noel Fryer “As for the US, stocks will still be the lowest in 5 years, whilst confirmation of yesterday's record US yield will have to wait for actual harvest data. The fund short is put at around 60,000 contracts.”
116 2018-08-12 22:02:49 Acually the nickel  deposit is the dark horse... nova sold one tgats very similer albeit  proven with drills for ... was it 100 million?
117 2018-08-12 22:02:14 He’s right. There’s basically zero support whatsoever for what you’re saying. It’s neat that you’ve swallowed that horseshit so corporations can buy back stocks and further funnel our nation’s wealth to a handful of people and whatnot, though.
118 2018-08-12 22:02:14 The wall st stocks thrive on war. China is heavy on US stocks. China would make a ton on getting it's own ass kicked.
119 2018-08-12 22:01:10 This silly folks... Why is this country so hell bent on destroying itself. The photo and the public shaming until the restaurant  owner must apologize. This like15th century stocks in the square punishment. This is the United States in 2018 not midevil Europe

128 2018-08-12 21:46:22 Go to London with part of it, and buy stocks with the rest. 10 grand isn't a hell of a lot, anymore.
129 2018-08-12 21:45:47 Boutta start throwing more bread in my savings & buying up more stocks.
130 2018-08-12 21:45:46 Don't let London spoil you! & switch on spell check you gorm. Have a good night!
131 2018-08-12 21:45:34 We can sit around and moan about all the problems in the world or can just get on with it and start buying stocks. If you really care about those millions of ppl, use the trade profits to help them.
132 2018-08-12 21:44:57 And that's why investing in stocks is a waste of time unless you're just investing for long term purposes. Plenty of ways to invest your time and money where you can have some semblance of control in the outcomes.
133 2018-08-12 21:44:44 Both decisions need to be made intelligently.  

Invest $100k in education for a Philosophy degree and you won't likely see an ROI.  

Invest $5k chasing hot stocks with little underlying value and you can get burnt just as easily.

135 2018-08-12 21:43:25 Oh and fb Netflix twtr etc aren’t bubbles among many over valued stocks.  It’s based on future prospects. We should keep burning fossil fuels and the like hey. Why not continue destroying this world for our children.  Millennials will believe in those ideas and that is Tesla
136 2018-08-12 21:40:15 God damn it. *stocks up on water and defences*
137 2018-08-12 21:39:17 I have racks in stocks, life insurance, retirement, savings deposits, bank certificates, real estate, you name it. I feel i got my money floating around everywhere!
138 2018-08-12 21:38:22 My boy @lmaogoddesslmao and i took 4 stocks in a crew battle. Grapple bois
139 2018-08-12 21:38:06 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $ATVI, $CBOE, $DOX, $NEWM, all may climb w/in 14, 10, 17, 19 days up to 5.9%, 2.6%, 2%, 6.6% respectively 
140 2018-08-12 21:37:49 I've been seeing the same pattern all over the place - American stocks, German stocks, South Korea, etc... Can you short something if you don't know what exchanges will survive? All this growth is built on debt... Its only a matter of time...
141 2018-08-12 21:37:38 USD Soars on Risk Aversion, CAD May Gap Lower - Asia Market Open
The US Dollar soared on haven demand, climbing as European financial exposure to Turkey sent global stocks tumbling. CAD may gap lower as Trump threatened auto tariffs on their neighbor...
142 2018-08-12 21:36:43 so, and this perhaps should have occurred to me sooner, if you have an idea of what you'd need I can check my shame-inducing stocks to see if I have any suitable I could send to you?
143 2018-08-12 21:36:02 And corruption like the medical device stocks Tina Will be voting on in the senate. Then selling them to enrich herself with millions. Tina should sell or step down
144 2018-08-12 21:35:48 Despicable that these companies would even be associated with @FoxNews which peddles lies, misinformation, propaganda, conspiracy theories, and who promotes white nationalism.  Time to rethink my purchases and stocks.  The American public does not have to support these companies!
145 2018-08-12 21:33:36 Ben Graham wasn’t nearly as good an investor as Warren is or even as good as I am. Buying those cheap, cigar-butt stocks was a snare and a delusion, and it would never work with the kinds of sums of money we have. You can’t do it with billions of dollars..." Charlie Munger
146 2018-08-12 21:33:34 Well everyone is watching from around the world... and your economy, stocks, currency etc. will all keep going down, until that dictator leader of yours leaves. Which... is a long way off! So GL to the people of Turkey.
147 2018-08-12 21:32:45 Reading "Trust me" and "Funding secured" in the interwebs always make me suspicious. ETF's, Stocks (good ones which survived even wars, like KO etc) Physical Gold and some crypto
148 2018-08-12 21:32:44 In traditional markets, a lot of #stocks and #commodities never fully recover after falling 90% from their ATH. 

The same will happen to most #Altcoins. Be careful out there.

#Cryptocurrency is not different.
149 2018-08-12 21:32:08 If it becomes de rigour to not issue stocks in the traditional fashion, it’s plausable that the utility token has several functions, could act as transferable frictionless stock,  if the platform has proof of stake that also acts as a form of dividend. And gas for network
150 2018-08-12 21:31:30 Get the stocks set up in the town square!
151 2018-08-12 21:31:14 Chuffed for yea. Don't change once you make it big. Haha.

153 2018-08-12 21:30:46 When the deal was announced both stocks when crazy and touched 835 and 70 respectively.. but that's when the thugs of hindostan.. played contract and started trapping the retail investors who started buying above 800 and 65

156 2018-08-12 21:27:40 Exactly. Government isn't stockpiling. Some companies have increased stocks
157 2018-08-12 21:27:11 I heard a bunch of candy asses are suing @elonmusk because of tweets. I wonder if it's to cover the cost of all that rectal cream they need after selling their stocks too soon and coming up short where it counts?
158 2018-08-12 21:26:10 Well actually I said the opposite,more restraints. No more bank bail outs,clamp down on exotic derivatives. Bring back glass steagall. Dodd Franks sucks-no bail out but where does it say no bail in? Stocks rise & fall on performance of a corporation.
159 2018-08-12 21:23:16 Thank you for your feedback. I was just writing in the heat of the moment, with 5 pints down me so my appologies haha
160 2018-08-12 21:21:30 If it ain’t stocks, don’t ask me to spend my money on it.
161 2018-08-12 21:20:13 Hope you're a better proFeSSional actor than speller, Tom. Bon chance!
162 2018-08-12 21:20:11 Now that I actually study charts and graphs in the stock market I can’t believe I picked some of the stocks I did last year 
163 2018-08-12 21:18:46 Nothing really gets to me anymore if you really want to get to me you got to tell me my stocks are going down lol
164 2018-08-12 21:18:07 @OriginsUKPR I went to place an order using the code you sent me in an email this morning but it seems you've run out. No disclaimer along the lines of "while stocks last". Disappointing.
165 2018-08-12 21:17:02 Only purpose of a blockchain is to minimize trust and be immutable, it is not doing any of that!
But the tech could be pretty helpful in a lot of areas!
If waltonchain would offer stocks, I would buy that
166 2018-08-12 21:16:14 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your bipolar disorder
167 2018-08-12 21:15:10 Well the way I see, with 4 stocks 1 stock is equivalent to quarter bar and theres always been thing like rest....macs ko punch....wobbling... you also have to build up meter first right?
168 2018-08-12 21:14:02 People are willing to buy penny stocks high but not short-sell high...
169 2018-08-12 21:13:25 and margins do peakout right? how much they can expand those? buying price is the only thing which can justify holding stocks at 80-90PE. and Yes looking into JUST PE is naive as you mentioned. No second thoughts on that but when its around 100, its red signal.
170 2018-08-12 21:11:50 This is why I always recommend investing in stocks and shares with tin foil manufacturers. The worse it gets the more you make!

183 2018-08-12 20:59:47 @RealConstable should have sent this to you -- More or less, you guys are arguing for a glorified butterfly.  Does implied #volatility warrant these kinds of #options #traders? #investors #stocks #investing #SundayMorning #SundayThoughts #SundayMotivation #SundayBrunch

185 2018-08-12 20:59:36 Il y'a beaucoup de paramètres qui rentrent en compte, le taux de change euro/ dollar n'est plus le même qu'il y'a 10 ans (le pétrole est acheté en dollars). La conjoncture internationale avec la crise avec l'Iran (les compagnies font des stocks)...
186 2018-08-12 20:58:21 well done Tom!

189 2018-08-12 20:55:27 Both $MLM and $VMC management said demand was going to accelerate into 2nd half yet stocks got hit hard. Wondering if the stocks are signaling a decent slow down here domestically coming. Otherwise both of these are screaming buys. Significant margin expansion.
190 2018-08-12 20:54:43 Is there a good way to estimate the total shareholders of a particular public equity?

After some googling it appears institutional holders are readily quoted. Big stocks appear to have 2000 to 2200 institutional shareholders -- think IBM, GOOG, and AAPL.
191 2018-08-12 20:54:05 The government do lots of stupid things, though my understanding is that it's Sanofi increasing insulin stocks because it needs to be refrigerated

202 2018-08-12 20:36:54 put it in the microwave, im no pediatrician. most of us have had more vacs than the general public from travel & working in hospitals - most of us dont die. they rest you cant easily know. & i have stocks in these companies - we all do. i just also like science.
203 2018-08-12 20:36:46 This has to be fake news.  If not and people buy the ipo, I'm selling all my stocks.
204 2018-08-12 20:36:42 that is good news but gouvernemt bonds and company stocks will turn to security tokens
205 2018-08-12 20:36:16 Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked banking stocks are Hancock Holding Company HBHC , Capstar Financial Holdings CSTR and First Bancorp FBNC , all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .
206 2018-08-12 20:33:42 Who are these Americans? The minority group of popular votes in the presidential election? Or the uppermost 10% stratum of wealthy Americans who own those stocks used as yardstick in measuring a robust economy? Aren’t all these stocks owners those rich Americans & businesses???
207 2018-08-12 20:30:14 I’m really sorry about your stocks , i hope they go up soon - xoxo your fav stock broker
208 2018-08-12 20:28:23 There’s one near us, but he’s dodgy as hell and also stocks golliwogs. So maybe I just need to start a non-racist one?
209 2018-08-12 20:26:43 Turkish gold merchants are all stashing their gold stocks and jacking up prices right now.
210 2018-08-12 20:25:41 Why are you saying yes. I will buy the remaining stocks and keep them at home. Minimum of 3 pairs at least.
211 2018-08-12 20:25:25 @zerodhaonline is there an app where i can track mutual funds and stocks in a single place ? These are ones bought outside Zerodha.
212 2018-08-12 20:25:17 I think they are fine if treated as equity. 

No matter even they are unbound from jurisdictions. Stocks prices are mostly collective imagination anyway, tokens can just as well. 

Will completely agree though, that having to purchase tokens to use some network is pointless.
213 2018-08-12 20:23:14 If you find it hard to be alone you should not be in a relationship. Go get some money, invest in stocks or become a gutter boy/girl
214 2018-08-12 20:23:05 I stay with her esteem, nor to the stocks were but if people as in proper conditions.

217 2018-08-12 20:10:46 When I got into financial markets, I started out buying shares(stocks), until I learned of special funds offered by commercial banks practicing retail banking. Please do read my article.
218 2018-08-12 20:06:42 Nonsense. Only the nation state has an interest in conserving the fish stocks in its own waters and requiring sustainable fishing. For outsiders, they’re a lootable resource.
219 2018-08-12 20:05:33 After never investing in stocks or even having 401k I decided to go all into #blockchain projects and used @garyvee and his wisdom to push me everyday. Working for other people sucks, it's time to get into the position to be able to work for myself. #Motivation

221 2018-08-12 20:02:21 Interesting...people/media are all talking about EU banks but they don't talk about that: "American investors, for example, own nearly 25 percent of outstanding Turkish bonds and more than half of publicly traded Turkish stocks, according to the I.I.F." - FT
222 2018-08-12 20:02:00 Much of the "news" = "noise."   Leads to bias. #stocks

224 2018-08-12 20:01:05 This person complains about everything!! @Marriott Don’t give in to the complaints of a blabbermouth that only complains to get attention.
225 2018-08-12 20:00:45 Hahahahah xD someone's been learning about stocks :p
226 2018-08-12 19:59:07 Definitely. I've held back on any investments besides a little in CRYPTO. I would stay away from any real estate & stocks unless it's very short term. Honestly, because silver has been suppressed so heavily I would consider small investments there as well.

228 2018-08-12 19:58:45 I mean sales figures is something we don't have access to, so you can't really claim anything for or against GOG's sales. Also, you'll note that GOG mainly stocks legacy games that aren't available elsewhere on their second / third run. Also, Steam was "cracked" a long time ago.

230 2018-08-12 19:53:10 Stocks should discount ahead of elections the possibility (and high certainty) of a profound change in D.C. We may once again see a seasonal decline from n October and a post-election rally in November, then a rough landing begins after this weakened global trading in 2018.
231 2018-08-12 19:52:34 No, they're upset because the person who defamed them is losing another lawsuit characterizing his speech as illegal slander, defamation, and libel, and if they continue to host his content, they'll lose money and their stocks will go down.
232 2018-08-12 19:49:49 TY so. much.  My husb is Oneg & there were times during his chemo that stocks were so low there was a risk they'd run out.  He's had to have 100s of bags of blood!  Without donors like you he wld not be here.  I wld be a widow, his son wld have no dad.  THANK YOU SO MUCH

239 2018-08-12 19:39:50 No need to borrow money to buy more $TSLA shares. Sold 1/2 position on $AMZN @ $1894 last week to have some cash available for more $TSLA purchase. Took profit on other stocks too and will rotate into $TSLA if it goes below my last purchase price. Margin buying is not my style.
240 2018-08-12 19:36:58 As I watch this surprisingly anemic Unite the Right rally come together, I can't help but imagine 3 well placed Deep State assassins with AR-15's and bump stocks could rid humanity of this festering boil in seconds.
241 2018-08-12 19:36:09 4.1 GDP,  unemployment at all time low. Economy is doing great. Stocks are way up. We’re able to buy a second house with money saved from taxes. We’ll never go back to past leadership that got us in the mess in the first place. We are all Americans.
242 2018-08-12 19:33:36 It's partially taken - american investors own 25 % of Turkish bonds and 50% of publicly traded Turkish stocks, according to the I.I.F.

245 2018-08-12 19:32:02 We’ve told them enough times. My local @Tesco no longer stocks it following my efforts. Neither should Waitrose. You want to buy a copy of #WDDTY? Go ahead. Subscribe for all I care. But do so via their website. Keep the public protected from their nonsense.
246 2018-08-12 19:30:53 always use that even with stocks
247 2018-08-12 19:29:39 Tip for young investors - diverse your investment portfolio. Invest in  Cryptos, gold, silver, and tech and cannabis stocks. Invest in stocks that pays dividend. Keep informed about news, current affairs. 

Have multiple streams of passive income. Don't put all eggs in one basket
248 2018-08-12 19:25:52 And I will tell you that I believe the economy is cyclical and there is not much one sitting president can do ... but we need to focus on the true economy - not the one reflected on Wall Street.  That makes me money but not every American owns stocks ...
249 2018-08-12 19:24:57 Im actually a terrible designer, I cant do nothing without stocks/images etc... I actually am doodoo
250 2018-08-12 19:23:40 Would then need to select the green stocks that closed in the top 25% of the day's range, or the red stocks that closed in the bottom 25% of the day's range.
251 2018-08-12 19:21:54 Very impressed that you know the best Russian Black Garlic still have the stocks attached.
252 2018-08-12 19:20:33 And the executives selling their stocks don't even get jail time for insider trading... sad...

259 2018-08-12 19:08:27 It doesnt ruin your whole game one though vecause you have 2 stocks to try to bring ot back instead of one as i said.
260 2018-08-12 19:07:08 Or because Elon didn’t take their investment and they really want $tsla stocks?

262 2018-08-12 19:06:18 Every president since Kennedy put assets in some sort of a blind trust. Now the president owns global businesses, House members trade in pharma stocks. At least one senator owns millions in medical device stocks. Corrupt. Vote them out!
263 2018-08-12 19:06:12 Also would like to add that only 11%of the tax cuts given to the top 1% we're used to give raises or add jobs. The rest of the money was used to buy back some of their stocks which is the biggest reason the market is on an upturn once they screw that up the market will tank
264 2018-08-12 19:05:45 Bryan, took years. But you must remember, when I started there was in internet. I drew some charts by hand! Chartbooks from Daily Graphs were MAILED to me.

270 2018-08-12 18:58:06 Stock buybacks. Again, good my stocks and 401k, but most people don’t own stocks and I think half of American workers still don’t have a 401k (from memory, could be more). Usually “investment” means automation btw - not great for jobs.
271 2018-08-12 18:57:56 Slalom was sliced sideways by you slick shadow spheres scouting super sneaky stocks, solemnly leaving slalom still, shuddering and slammed.

276 2018-08-12 18:45:48 And our electoral system is being hacked by Russia as we speak because you did not feel that it was Important enough to fund. if you read the financials, there are very few job wage increases and corps used the tax credits to purchase and unload stocks. Your email is a scam
277 2018-08-12 18:44:30 Dear @SEC_News , the Commission might want to check the names of people who shorted Harley stock shortly before this announcement, and compare it to the lists of people who shorted other stocks shortly before previous tweets. Bet you find a pattern of people who benefitted

281 2018-08-12 18:39:42 Your best argument is stock options? Stock options are just a ploy for the working class to feel like the ruling class. Very few people have enough stocks for it to actually matter, that's the way they want it to be. You say it's gotten more complicated but it really hasnt.
282 2018-08-12 18:39:40 Can you pay taxes in gold or Amazon stocks?
283 2018-08-12 18:39:17 I don't use credit cards, There's nothing on my credit since I bought my car five years ago...SO no my finances have nothing to do with my credit at this time. Tho my stocks and bands keep me in good financial stability. I don't rely on credit that can change at any moment....
284 2018-08-12 18:38:03 IKEA will soon run out of stocks to the Amazon/Flipkart e-tailers who will loot the last pin out of its stores to make windfall online.
285 2018-08-12 18:37:30 You are correct... but add $2 billion purchase of $TSLA stocks and Bloomberg article, it seems to point that Saudi did this to open a discussion about taking $TSLA private or to make a large investment. Just my guess based on observation.

288 2018-08-12 18:32:45 There is way more noise and way less signal in the crypto space but I don't think the exposure to understanding ratio is worse than the public equities sector. Anyone investing in tech stocks should have a pretty solid understanding of macroeconomics (currency/capital controls)
289 2018-08-12 18:32:02 The modern day equivalent of being pegged with tomatoes while locked in stocks. Sorry that happened to you. :(

299 2018-08-12 18:29:16 It's not just cats. We have a colony of crows here, and this year they have eaten whatever birds we had around here. Any bird who has tweeted is instantly surrounded by a murder of crows, and we now have NO birdsong AT ALL. Parakeets also take food stocks.

305 2018-08-12 18:21:11 This is called Capitalism. One of your previous examples conceded that America is negotiating from a position of strength (Economically speaking). Invest in stocks, start your own company, take a risk. The odds are in your favor.
306 2018-08-12 18:20:46 The stupidest trend I see is crypto people trying to use technical analysis on publicly traded stocks. Ridiculous lol.

309 2018-08-12 18:16:10 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your carpal tunnel syndrome
310 2018-08-12 18:14:09 False. We don’t have universal background checks. We don’t have a gun registry. We don’t have required safety training. We don’t have a ban on military-grade assault rifles. We don’t have a ban on high-capacity magazines and bump stocks. We don’t prosecute negligence. Etc.

317 2018-08-12 18:08:34 Forgive me if I’m wrong, but if we compare our results to the “index”, then isn’t index investing just “average”?? It certainly is better (and easier) than picking specific stocks for most however

The only thing your tax cut did, was allow companies to buy back their own stocks and made the rich, richer. The average person is losing!

For sympathy I use Google but most of the stocks have no sympathy! I was wonder if I'm doing it right or there has always to be sympathy ?
325 2018-08-12 18:01:36 Actually, companies are putting their extra money into their stocks and wages aren't keeping up with inflation
326 2018-08-12 18:01:17 Anyone notice that McClintock's financials are exactly the same as they were 10 years ago?  His house hasn't increased in value. His stocks have not gained profits. Has anyone challenged his Financial filings?
327 2018-08-12 18:00:13 Buy stocks na sa tingin mo ay tatagal at nag ooperate pa rin after 20-50 years.

Kapag stock trading kasi, dapat tutok ka at kung Jollibee ung bibilhin mo sobrang baba ng return in the short run. More on investing and inactive/passive trading yung mga ganung company.

404 2018-08-12 16:57:49 ECONOMICS IS EASY WHEN U GET THE HANG OF IT stocks are hard and obvi your class will be different than mine but ask a lot of questions!! it also helped me learn valuable skills :3
405 2018-08-12 16:57:43 Yun lang. malamang sa mga resellers na lang meron stocks 
406 2018-08-12 16:56:43 I think Stocks are still a play till the end of the year.
Then, we'll have to revaluate.
Buying pressure is maintained with media coverage and ETFs sold to middle class. 
When this will run out of gas, run for your life. 
407 2018-08-12 16:55:27 Yes but you can trade anything, not just stocks!
408 2018-08-12 16:55:09 Je pense que c'est acheté avant lannulation qd meme. C'est dans les stocks, faut écouler. Stalké c'était en seconde partie de soirée voire plus tard
409 2018-08-12 16:54:10 Yes, I agree. Don't think I'll be paying 23% conts anytime soon btw 
410 2018-08-12 16:54:09 True. Bukan nak buka restoran je kena ada fulus kepok2. Nak sewa lot kedai dlm mall pun paling kencang kena ada 100k which includes rent, stocks, renovation, system, security, staff lagi. 

Tak semua orang ada duit nak terus buka kedai.
411 2018-08-12 16:52:55 For what it’s worth Nassib said editing made it sound like he thought banks were giving out 10 %. Said he was factoring in stocks and other investments.
412 2018-08-12 16:51:47 A very old 'rule of thumb' was pay half your age as a % based on the age you start.

Start at 20, pay 10%.

No doubt it can be disproved but getting people saving is more important, initially, than saving the right amount (imo).
413 2018-08-12 16:51:42 Us "are Ian Kinsler shirts in stock yet"
Red Sox Team Store that stocks Drew Pomeranz shirts " ya we don't stock shirts of players until they're good"
414 2018-08-12 16:51:24 With @Extraction_OG stocks plummeting and the cost of paying for @broomfield’s health and safety...I will say this one last time...Extraction cannot afford to do business in Broomfield. #copolitics #xog
415 2018-08-12 16:50:47 My friend, your “condescension” is “futile” when you’ve used “incorrect terminology.”

A “decentralized blockchain” is not akin to “derivatives” or “stocks” therefore a more apt “description” is “warranted.”

Don’t get condescending with CT you twat. You’re in our realm, behave.
416 2018-08-12 16:49:42 Recipes, keeping an eye on your stocks, writing the company newsletter… the possibilities are endless.
417 2018-08-12 16:48:36 Toby couldn't   including cocky stocks ?!?
418 2018-08-12 16:46:18 Facts it bugs me when people say “im an artist” but all they do is throw stocks around. I do it but my stuff is far from art
419 2018-08-12 16:45:19 All this talk about #SpaceForce reminds me, what happened to banning of bump stocks & gun control laws? When will Flint have clean drinking water? When will Puerto Rico have power? When will we have a capable group running America instead of trying to distract us all the time?
420 2018-08-12 16:45:03 @GOP say anything to make a buck....Donald Trump Sr. Not only will this admin say anything to make a buck, manipulate stocks for instance but they will do anything, back channels for hotels, russian oil, etc.
421 2018-08-12 16:42:58 Earnings continued to drive stocks. A tighter Treasury yield spread and higher dollar amid emerging market woes weighed on markets.
422 2018-08-12 16:42:12 Hi guys!  I'm new to the idea of stocks and investing.  I am looking for safe legitamate ideas, mentors, and ways to invest in my families future.  My philosiphy is that, If we could lend a hand, and help each other.  The world would be a better place.

423 2018-08-12 16:41:52 Weird: Under a dividend discount model, where implied value/price is function of future dividends, due to time value of money, value (generally div paying) stocks theoretically could have higher PEs than growth (generally non div-paying) stocks depending on size of discount rate.
424 2018-08-12 16:41:38 She is right. Industries are calling out for employees and there is no one there to hire.  We need free community college and vocational education programs.  And no more tax cuts to the wealthy who just take the $$ and run, buy yachts, buy back stocks and stick it to taxpayers.
425 2018-08-12 16:40:59 Coupled with a tendency to speak before my brain is in gear. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't! 
426 2018-08-12 16:40:40 Which of these MJ stocks will be the biggest gainer in the coming months? $RSHN $LCLP $MDCN $HEME
427 2018-08-12 16:40:14 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
428 2018-08-12 16:40:13 The amount of index buying has forced the index higher but many stocks can't be justified that high do to keep index value going higher the most shorted are the easiest to jam higher.
429 2018-08-12 16:40:10 Bcp plus que 3ans, c'est de la foutaise cette promesse. Même si ils devaient la tenir (ce qu'ils ne feront pas) les stocks sont plein pr 5ans.
430 2018-08-12 16:39:07 Hey Stocks-n-Crypto(@StocksNCrypto), thank you for following me
431 2018-08-12 16:38:19 Snap (SNAP) became the latest social network giant to report disappointing user levels. IBD 50 stocks Trade Desk (TTD) and Planet Fitness (PLNT) soared to record highs on earnings. A slew of top software firms, several shale plays and some hot apparel makers reported
432 2018-08-12 16:38:15 Two left feet?
433 2018-08-12 16:37:35 I'm an expert at putting my foot it in.
434 2018-08-12 16:36:16 The only thing going against you there are facts. Trump found that out when he asked what the major industries what would they do with the tax cuts the majority of businesses said the same answer, buy back stocks, not expand  their business. It also blew a hole in the deficit.
435 2018-08-12 16:35:45 Yes - I lost a kidney from a rugby injury in 1982 - been fine since
436 2018-08-12 16:34:50 I could survive with just one kidney, right? It's an option ....

438 2018-08-12 16:33:13 It happened after Friday nights Sun/Sky game. Stocks ran a play even though she was already up by a lot so Sloot could get her assist record. She got it. And Curt was hella pissed of about it & yelled “bush league” in her face & other things. It was so unprofessional. Smh!
439 2018-08-12 16:31:27 True, that was a quote based on last week's rates for a female retiring at 60.
440 2018-08-12 16:31:06 The article states stocks can be risky .. shocker .. It's not exactly  a secret Brandon that higher wages and energy prices create inflation ..
441 2018-08-12 16:28:53 No Thunder Stocks @NewHumberstone today so our racing weekend is over with a P3 @OhswekenSpdway and a P2 @Merrittville. No flat tires and minimal body damage so it was a good weekend.

Key levels are #EURUSD 1.14 & #USDJPY 110.0

443 2018-08-12 16:27:30 Our greedy politicians have had a big hand in this as well.  Many of them own healthcare industry stocks.
444 2018-08-12 16:27:24 @m_alalwan محمد، how would we differentiate between value stocks and growth stocks? Can you please give sample of growth stocks from TASI?
445 2018-08-12 16:26:53 unless you're studying to be in stocks, business, a doctor, a lawyer, or a scientist, i don't see the point in being so broke in college you can only eat ramen, and then after you graduate you owe at least $20k in debt.  like, what is the point?
446 2018-08-12 16:26:43 How much is the recent run up in US #stocks a function of 10-Year yields stuck below 3%? A look at 30 days correlations between the S&P 500 & long dated #bonds gives a surprising answer: not much. #Earnings seem to be the primary driver. On a separate note, sector correlations
447 2018-08-12 16:25:42 And what are your values??? Please let me know..
BTW yes Baskonia already said that they have a deal to buy 85% of the stocks
Haritz Querejeta said they were there to buy sochaux..
448 2018-08-12 16:22:09 Instead of having people talk about a record which helps the league, we're talking about this man yelling at @Amber_Stocks. It was classless and unprofessional. That 1 assist was not going to change the game. And that was only if they actually got the assist. Team @wnbachicagosky
449 2018-08-12 16:18:45 Dude if I was in japan this wouldn’t be an issue but no one stocks the fairy wand in the US anymore
450 2018-08-12 16:16:27 Time to buy TVS Motors and other south based stocks?
451 2018-08-12 16:15:05 If you're going to worry about short-term volatility, you're just not going to be able to buy the cheapest stocks. With the cheapest stocks, the outlooks are uncertain. -- Richard Pzena

453 2018-08-12 16:11:55 This may sound like a reach but I wonder if this gave the idea of trading stocks and shit like that? They put a monetary value on everything and it could have started this long ago. Just a thought.
454 2018-08-12 16:10:54 Siii, esta chica la llevo siguiendo en el dev años ya TwT y ni una vez he usado ningún stock suyo por dejadez xD o porque no me convencía la pose, tu has usado alguna owo ?

455 2018-08-12 16:09:15 Lol, Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world, not new news. But he's richer than the next richest by more than half the net worth of the next richest.

His amazon stocks alone are worth $149,000,000,000 today

Bill Gates is second richest and isn't even past $100 billion

465 2018-08-12 16:00:08 You mean the US CIA? WTF do they know about EU monetary matters or East Atlantic fish stocks for that matter? Look it up on Eurostat or something credible. Even the Dept of Finance publishes figures on the sovereign debt. It’s c.€200b, not €1.7t
466 2018-08-12 16:00:03 Ha, stocks are up.  They will crash under the next leftist president.  Because big business know they will lose money under them.  Notice the recession happened when Obama was elected.  Yeah go be tolerant somewhere else trump hater.
467 2018-08-12 15:59:44 The average millionaire has 7 sources of income. I work a full time corporate job, invest in stocks/crypto, and have side hustles. Don’t put all your focus and/or hope into one stream of income. $BTC

469 2018-08-12 15:57:38 Review of the weekly charts of my holdings follows.  I’m not a trader but do like to keep up with the trends which sometimes inform my buy decisions.  I choose stocks to buy based on their fundamentals.
470 2018-08-12 15:57:37 @NancyPelosi inside traded @VISA stocks in 2011 - She purchased 5,000 shares at $44 and sold for $64 2 days later making $100,000 and @60Minutes actually confronted her and she got very angry #CultureOfCorruption #Democrats #2018Elections #2018Midterms
471 2018-08-12 15:56:53 Evil? How is lowering taxes, strengthening the economy, bolstering stocks for our 401ks, lowering unemployment, lowest black unemployment in history, protecting our borders, bringing back manufacturing jobs, etc.etc How is that evil?
472 2018-08-12 15:55:49 No doubt your economy is better off now; corporate kick backs, stocks, a little insider trading, graft.

Stop lying and laughing on your way to the bank.

473 2018-08-12 15:54:11 Mao, generally speaking, avoided fighting the Japanese, leaving that to Chang Kai Shek's Nationalists whilst building up his armament stocks for his later insurgency against Chang.
474 2018-08-12 15:53:17 easy to bash #Bitcoin when it's making one of it's reasonable corrections. Why aren't these critics talking about how BTC has stomped all over every currency in the world including most stocks, precious metals etc over the last 5+ years. Their criticisms are cherry picked.

479 2018-08-12 15:51:09 Stocks go up, stocks go down?
480 2018-08-12 15:50:59 It's serious because women in the UK should not be forced to cover there face and Boris makes jokes about it. We need strong politicians not laughing stocks.

483 2018-08-12 15:49:18 Good for you to keep at it. One suggestion that's worked for me... Only trade market leaders: $AMZN $AAPL $NFLX etc and follow the rules laid out in How to Make Money in Stocks.

491 2018-08-12 15:39:41 The x20 rule works well: if you plan on an income of £12,000 pa, you need to save £240,000 (or thereabouts). It works but it's still daunting.

494 2018-08-12 15:36:00 The bad news is for youngsters who would have got a place in a company pension scheme - they'll be getting less from their bosses. The good news is that 10m people who got nothing, are now getting something - albeit not enough!

500 2018-08-12 15:32:37 tRUmp has sure turned his back on his city. tRUmp is in the WH so why isn't HE doing anything? If he didn't spend a 1/3 of his time playing golf maybe he could get something done.

Gotcha, tRUmp can't get anything done. What happened to no bump stocks, background checks. #SAD

511 2018-08-12 15:27:36 Absolutely. It's "double your money" in some cases, why would you opt out.
512 2018-08-12 15:27:04 What's that you say @ktw62 you'd like a turn in the stocks

516 2018-08-12 15:25:46 RE stocks like DLF, Unitech, Jai Corp pre the sub prime crisis.
Of late, a few fads with no moats might be:
1. "Specialty" chemicals. No one understands what's specialty & commodity.

2. MSME lending: Real moat is in collection, people chasing growth. Any fool with money can lend
517 2018-08-12 15:25:23 The number 1 mistake new traders make (both #crypto and #stocks ) is trading/checking too frequently. Most holdings in any market will be profitable if you buy during recognizable dips and hold for the long term.

519 2018-08-12 15:24:59 Anyone who can underperform the $spy that bad while pumping penny stocks on CNBC and trading on insider info is pretty talented. Why do you guys bow to a fraud?
520 2018-08-12 15:24:29 The  there's the danger of "I'll opt out for a bit then rejoin" and never doing so. It's tough when it's a decision between paying a mortgage off and saving for retirement. I do think that the employer-matched conts are the main reason for not opting out though.
521 2018-08-12 15:23:47 Ouais enfin on nous annonçait 1000 exemplaire pour toute la France il me semble, alors voir que les stocks n'ont jamais été "épuisés", ça fait doucement rigoler quant à la vérité derrière ces chiffres. Qui sont certainement là pour pourrir les spéculateurs.

529 2018-08-12 15:20:11 Haven't seen him mentioned yet so I'll suggest @alluvialcapital. If he's open to it, Dave would be incredible and differentiated from your prior guests. Track record identifying and investing in microcap, OTC, and other thinly traded stocks is extremely impressive.
530 2018-08-12 15:19:46 Congrats to last nights winners Justin Sanders with the Thompson’s Auto Winged 360 Sprint Cars, Jake Morgan with the Wingless Sprints, Dan Jinkerson with the Pure Stocks and Alex Gutierrez with the Mini Trucks!
531 2018-08-12 15:18:56 Agreed. Calls (already) to up rates before we hit 8%.

Yes it's low relative to DB schemes but for many workers, 8% pension contribution is more than many many would've had before AE.

Danger is, too high and people opt out. Need it to become the norm before increasing imo

533 2018-08-12 15:16:33 And exactly what did America inherit from Bush and who brought us back in eight short years causing America tock@e back in full swing? Stocks are going to crash again under your new and uninformed president who actually knows nothing of budgets or foreign policy.
534 2018-08-12 15:13:09 Hope they get Hazard pay and invest well in the stocks Got a Feeling they'll be looking for work .. Americans have long memories
535 2018-08-12 15:12:16 So thanks for bringing up something I didn’t touch on, how Darth Cheeto and his merry Congressmen are trying to slash the safety net even further to pay for corporation tax breaks that enabled massive stock buybacks. Good for my 401k and stocks, bad for the country.
536 2018-08-12 15:11:55 sir, please suggest some penny  stocks, but good business.... please, please, please.

544 2018-08-12 15:08:27 Overall market looks richly valued I agree hence one has to be careful 
But specific stocks which have already been hammered and are down by massive 60 to 70% are ideal relating candidates provided business model is strong and promoters are honest and credible
545 2018-08-12 15:08:25 8-Bit Phoenix Winged Knight Helmet was sold for 700 and was on 1200 stocks which is now 650 robux and on the other hand the Gadgets
Bandolier was sold for 200 robux on 1500 stocks which is now 1700 Robux

The sad thing is I bought 8-Bit Phoenix when it was sold

554 2018-08-12 14:52:21 I think the 2 yr oil move is largely over & that it ultimately falls below the $26 low. First stop should be mid-50's but when the global deflationary bust hits next yr, I think oil falls to $10. I think oil stocks will join financial stocks as underperformers in the last upleg.

575 2018-08-12 14:34:32 I’m just saying one year of investing in obvious stocks isn’t a story.  If he can do it over the long term then it gets interesting.  Not hating on Kanye.  I just think the story is misleading.  I own most of those stocks and I’m no guru.
576 2018-08-12 14:34:20 Do you know how to read?

Do you understand what words mean in the English language?

They made it very clear that the price could at any time! 

Are you aware when someone signs up, they agreed to those terms?

Do you cancel your insurance policy when the rates go up every year?
577 2018-08-12 14:33:33 On insider trading: When I was a financial editor in Taiwan, I was forbidden from investing in local stocks. And the reports I edited wouldn't have given me an advantage. Major investors have already made their moves well before financial analysis is published.

582 2018-08-12 14:28:58 Yeah, Trump told you to take a hike, and rightly so. He's got enough crooks surrounding him, already. You're just more dead weight, crook.
I'll bet all those to whom you touted stocks want to kick you straight in the butt, crook.
583 2018-08-12 14:28:04 Bruh I feel like I can sell these stocks right now and make a nice profit. But I just know if I hold out another couple months it’ll probably increase
584 2018-08-12 14:27:07 Why not achieving a degree useful to get a highly paid job, and then invest a meaningful % of your wage in stocks? Imo you need both a source of steady income and the temperament to invest it in stocks for a long long time.

590 2018-08-12 14:19:43 People operating scams such as payday loans, insurance and Ponzi schemes with stocks on Wall Street are filling their bank accounts with $50 million, $100 million, and more.

593 2018-08-12 14:16:20 Soybean number just plain bearish.  Large increase in yld killer and could be realized.  Small increase in demand, and yes exports increased some and likely more to come.  Even with increase in 2017 demand, stocks still at all time record 785 MB.  Tough road ahead to overcome.
594 2018-08-12 14:15:20 Haven’t theChinese backed of their tariffs on oil?

597 2018-08-12 14:12:40 Corn saw large increase in yld, now at new record.  Questionable due to fast crop development, 2nd only to drought year of 2012 and hot dry Aug.  Finally saw increase in Feed use.  Exports hiked too.  In end stocks still manageable at 1.68 BB, which should be largest for year.

607 2018-08-12 14:03:57 I’m going full libertarian. Yikes! Pervasive insider trading raises the cost/barrier to entry of buying stocks for everyone else. This is clearly not optimal & theres no incentive for a stock exchange to do this since it would cap its max size tho a stock exchange could choose to

611 2018-08-12 14:00:37 additionally, security doesn't really pay off as much as most people assume it does. When companies take hits from security vulns, they're only short-term, and the stocks recover much faster than most assume. So the pressure isn't there.

623 2018-08-12 13:52:59 BTW Short selling is an integral part of the markets for a number of reasons.

628 2018-08-12 13:49:21 Should be President but you can thank Hillary and Bernie for that.  What is lost is how the Left caused this by bussing in and flooding the boxes with voters in the primary because they thought Trump was the easy victory. Kasich was always the right choice and got my vote!
629 2018-08-12 13:49:11 Exactly. Because when based on price action, every investment, also btc investment, is a bad investment. It’s all going down. Even stocks.

634 2018-08-12 13:41:07 Ou alors, s'ils font, ils ne contrôlent pas. Les maires (de droite) ont fini leurs stocks de pesticides interdits, très dangereux (1998 1999) en les déversant par dizaines de litres au bord des villages. Je l'ai vu de mes yeux.
635 2018-08-12 13:40:56 With a $100k investment in education, you can make very conservatively $50k a year for decades. More if you invest in grad school.  Can't do that with $5k in stocks, unless you bought AMZN at the very bottom.

637 2018-08-12 13:39:08 I noticed that on some of the DB schemes I've worked on, where a DC plan was set up after the scheme closed. The rates didn't drop that dramatically but they did drop.

646 2018-08-12 13:30:26 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
647 2018-08-12 13:29:51 This is absolutely wrong. MC maybe would be 1T but to get to it you technicaly need just 1 #XRP be bought at that price and in that moment MC would be 1T. Apple is atm worth 1T but not all the stocks had to be bought at certain price to reach that value. Learn before talking!

653 2018-08-12 13:22:22 I assume it also  devalues stocks across the board, hurting shareholders generally and companies looking to raise equity, as people will pay less for something when they there is asymmetric information in the market.

655 2018-08-12 13:20:13 Your response is laughable. Did Putin request the sanctions that the WH just placed on Russia?  And if you have US stocks then you’re doing very well compared to the rest of world where Europe is flat and emerging markets are down the most.
656 2018-08-12 13:19:13 Hi miss ya, my system don't work with futures just stocks only. Have a great weekend.
657 2018-08-12 13:17:06 Just the very very rich and those who own individual stocks.  Nothing legislated to create employment and besides the past President had similar numbers after his legislation which did pass.  No one moving back. No new steel companies.

659 2018-08-12 13:15:59 Your crisis is about U  have to settle down  about 230 billion USD foreign debt within a few months before the end of year. You don’t have enough USD stocks/income to cover that shortterm debt & sleeping at the door of US, EU, Russia, China almost everybody who can borrow you.
660 2018-08-12 13:14:15 Ah he said kinda like mom and dad. Truth is when the president speaks people do listen.  Case in point Trump boasts a candidate on Twitter they supposedly win.  When he calls out a company he doesn't like stocks fall.  Words matter.  What a leader says matters.  Trumps no leader
661 2018-08-12 13:13:24 You are mistaken. The chaos that Trump is creating, at the request of Putin, is affecting all in the world. Also the stocks that I hold on the NY Stock Exchange. Not doing well, these days.

663 2018-08-12 13:11:42 I hear you.  I have been watching @savestacks on his journey too.  All I can say is have a plan.  Maybe on next rotation higher, rotate some out of cannabis and into traditional stocks.  Think of it as a kind of deleveraging strategy perhaps.  Hope you make a ton. Good luck

665 2018-08-12 13:10:35 Peter's msg was about never buying markets trending down. That includes stocks & Btc. It's a trading approach that sells when uptrend changes. Matt introduced idea of holding Btc like stocks. Ownership/holding longterm only makes sense for future earnings which no currency offers
666 2018-08-12 13:08:19 Thanks.  I'm a big fan of traditional investing and dividend collecting but somehow ended up down this road of cannabis stocks.  Now that I'm on the train, it would be very mentally difficult to just hop off and watch the industry unfold without participating.  FOMO

673 2018-08-12 13:02:25 It's not even the stock market. The Dow Jones is a select number of stocks. If a stock in it starts doing bad it's removed and replaced with another so it's designed to always go up unless there's some huge crash. It's pretty meaningless.

2) if you don’t want learn about stocks invest in index funds
3) avoid expensive management fees (do 2 will help)
4) be greedy when others are fearful

799 2018-08-12 09:41:27 Be it Steel, Rayon, Cement or Solar, the Gov't is prompt to put an anti dumping duty to help the local producer. But on agri produce, forget helping, it is actively importing food at prices which kills the farmer. Even importing when buffer stocks exist.

Why did IREDA, a PSU of Renewable Energy, give a loan to Kusum Finserv which deals in Stocks?
If you apply for a loan, the PSU will seek experience of working in Renewable energy.

 Did Jay Shah fulfill the norms?
Govt PSUs are not private properties.

807 2018-08-12 09:32:26 We take it for granted that all investors follow basic tenets. Surprisingly very few investors think stocks as part ownership of business. Getting this single perspective right would greatly influence long term investment results.

900 2018-08-12 06:08:25 These people don’t understand bid-ask spread. If this goes the way it sure seems like it’s going, bids dry up. Stocks don’t go down in price because of shorts, naked or not. They drop when bids dry up.

918 2018-08-12 05:49:12 That's a lie. After tax loop holes America comes in 4th highest. Trickle down is a lie. Companies used their tax breaks to buy back stocks. Not to invest or hire employees. Demand creates jobs. Pay people more, they buy more. Creating demand, creating jobs.

1050 2018-08-12 02:48:34 If Pokey yelled in someone’s face like that, I would be in an uproar. I don’t care the reason. Maybe Stocks shouldn’t have done that. That still DOES NOT JUSTIFY CURT YELLING IN HER FACE. But to each its own, I guess.
1051 2018-08-12 02:48:14 That's the one I'm watching, but there continue to be strong stocks against a soft SPY. the afternoon fades last week bother me more than charts.
1052 2018-08-12 02:47:42 this isn't going anywhere.. we will agree to disagree.. because both were wrong.. but what Stocks did was worse imo..
1053 2018-08-12 02:46:20 Yes- I’ve noticed that oil stocks crash whenever Elon states they will be profitable or planning to improve service in Norway. Big oil is in a panic over tesla and is determine to destroy them by short selling before elon does another Auto pilot update.
1054 2018-08-12 02:43:21 Don’t have time to Google It right now, but I think it’s around 120-150. Not sure. I do appreciate the tax break, and a much better lending platform for small business owners! My stocks have boomed so it’s been a good past year for me. Have a great weekend!

1059 2018-08-12 02:37:37 Michigan study just showed that average wage growth is outpacing inflation rate; and the numbers prove it. Despite tariffs stocks rise. Try using real data and not selective data to prove your convoluted message.

1085 2018-08-12 02:10:23 It should be converted to all fiat. It should be a mix of stocks/bonds/cash/etc with some crypto. It should have a risk in line with their operational cash flow needs. You can have your $$ grow without such massive risk

1089 2018-08-12 02:03:19 My point is that the people who can speak out against this hunter do not understand wild harvesting of whale, seal, caribou, or any other traditional food. Those same people choose to keep quiet on trophy hunting, slaughtering of mass cattle, and depleting wild salmon stocks.

1170 2018-08-12 00:49:02 نظام اردوغان يكذب في كل شيء
في مخزون الذهب الاستراتيجي
في حجم الدين الخارجي
في توزيع التهم
ونظام فشل اقتصادياً
اعتقاداً منه ان تسارع وتيرة النمو تخدم البلد متجاهلاً في المقابل معدلات التضخم وهي التي تعصف بالليرة اليوم
ومصطنعاً لنمو اقتصادي بضخ سيولة في الاسواق متجاهلا التضخم ايضا
1171 2018-08-12 00:48:30 The money that is made off penny stocks is crazy there is no other way to make this much money fast like this! @BIGMONEYMIKE6
1172 2018-08-12 00:47:02 Anecdotally, I looked back about a months worth of tweets. It appeared that they spend a lot of time warning personal investors about the perils of fraudulent micro-cap stocks (which are everywhere). Although, that was only a month...so within the $TSLAQ time horizon.
1173 2018-08-12 00:46:38 Is the money worth it? Can you get a different job within the company and then keep the stocks?
1174 2018-08-12 00:46:27 تركيا "نظام أردوغان"
متحالف مع الفرس
بعد ان فشل في الانضمام للنادي النصراني "اليورو" فشل في علاقاته مع الشرق وهو المفترض ان يكون البديل
وهذا ما دفعه للدخول في تحالف جديد مع نظام فاشي ويقترب من السقوط وهو نظام الملالي 
هذه سياسة ثورية غبية
1175 2018-08-12 00:45:59 Biggest heist in modern history. Execs make $ from fraud, get enormous salary/bonuses/stock options, fraud boosts stock prices, execs sell stocks, fraud falls apart & stock mkt crashes, Bush/Obama swoop in to give $ trillions to execs, execs buy stocks back low & make insane $.

1186 2018-08-12 00:37:55 While obviously there's no items and such in these games, discussing time/length sets is always a thing when a new game drops.

Suddenly taking things out because you saw something that wasn't placed in a tournament ruleset doesn't make it broken. Consider time and stocks too.

1195 2018-08-12 00:30:05 ...I have a problem with growth-stock investing. Companies tend not to grow at high rates forever. Businesses change... Markets mature. Competition can increase. Good managements can retire... the market is littered with once highly profitable growth stocks... -- Ed Wachenheim
1196 2018-08-12 00:26:16 That was quite the hissy fit he threw over this nonsense. Stocks kept her cool though n didn't stoop to his level. You lost Miller, get over it and move onto the next game
1197 2018-08-12 00:25:51 HE certainly has the POWER. One Tweet and the DOW moves 200 points. After 8 years of such market volatility, the NYSE will be a frying pan with a bunch of scrambled eggs, I mean, stocks in it. So much for the efficient and informative market hypothesis. Good luck, US investors!

1199 2018-08-12 00:25:07 Irrelevant for me, only when trying to buy one, which is why I hope mine lasts a long time I'm not interested in having to spend that much to replace it hahaha. Want to invest? Do it with stocks and gold. Not video games. I play the shit for fun, period.

1201 2018-08-12 00:24:02 All of the gop said it would benefit workers more than companies, it hasn’t. Trump’s campaign economist, Stephen Moore, said it create wage growth, it hasn’t. All neutral economists said companies would use it to buy stocks, which is what they did

1255 2018-08-11 23:35:39 Short thesis is correct as it was with most of the financial stocks in 2007&2008. They used SIVs, Tesla is uses false statements and reverse factoring to inflate results.

1292 2018-08-11 22:46:02 Lol I just texted you about this.  How to buy at lowest fee and be sure it is 100% gold?

Are you also looking at gold mining stocks?
1293 2018-08-11 22:45:05 Let's just fish the sea to death eh?! The EU quotas saved the fish stocks,
1294 2018-08-11 22:44:53 While I don’t think we should start we it in the main ruleset, I commented because I think the claim that it is like traditional fighting game meter is bogus. We’d be entering a world where little Mac gets 2 meters that can kill absurdly early against lightweight and 3 stocks.

1297 2018-08-11 22:39:46 Before Trump, first world advice was to take a staycation after a vacation to get reacclimated before returning to work. Now it's buy stocks impacted by tariffs to wait for their inevitable rebound post-Blue Wave.
1298 2018-08-11 22:37:24 @jimcramer Hello Jim, quick question:  Your show (Mad Money)
Is excellent in many ways, however I don’t understand how to implement your many complex strategies for pinpointing stocks to consider buying.  It sounds like you would need an army of professional staff and equipment.
1299 2018-08-11 22:37:24 Buy stocks impacted by tariffs.

1300 2018-08-11 22:37:23 Glad you liked it! If you haven’t read the book, I’d recommend it as a good read for anyone interested in dividend stocks.
1301 2018-08-11 22:35:13 I was talking about stocks btw just making sure it’s clear and you understand and private means going off the stock market
1302 2018-08-11 22:33:39 We’ve heard about the technologies to fight #IUUfishing! r we now moving into a new age where real technological advance is going to change things completely? Is technology now offering us a real hope for the future of Global Fish Stocks?@fishgovernance @DrRashidSumaila @FAOfish

1304 2018-08-11 22:31:35 Everytime I see a photo with a guy showing off a stack of cash I laugh my ass off.  A) dude put that money in the bank, stocks, etc.  B) It's probably all the money he has.  C) ladies don't date guys like that.
1305 2018-08-11 22:28:58 hahah sure stockholders of common shares don't get their money back when a company goes under but those stocks are debt issued by that same company.
1306 2018-08-11 22:28:46 Yup thats what they were buying back their stocks for. 
1307 2018-08-11 22:28:34 Where's the straw man? Matt is on the record saying big companies are more efficient/good than small ones, that he prefers redistribution of capital income rather then reducing it, and that he's fine with big for profit companies controlling production if stocks are socialized
1308 2018-08-11 22:28:19 Two categories: (1) "Deep value" investing means buying stocks that are quantitatively cheap, but where the companies are often mediocre (or worse) businesses --> this approach is more consistent; (2) Find a truly high-quality company (sustainably high ROIC) like See's Candies...
1309 2018-08-11 22:28:18 Got my lac sitting right , I can’t ride stocks , that’s just me
1310 2018-08-11 22:26:53 hahaha have you ever bought a stock b4? A company takes on an enormous amout of debt when it issues stocks; bonds are a different kind of debt that is promised to be paid back at a certain rate at a certain date. Stock just has no rate or date, still debt that allows me to vote
1311 2018-08-11 22:25:12 3 day weekend and good benefits  one more year I get stocks only thing keeping me at that place lol
1312 2018-08-11 22:24:46 You forgot to ask what other stocks he likes.
1313 2018-08-11 22:24:46 Whatever time frames you use for #trading, it's important that your methods are able to quickly determine when a trend has ended without waiting for a retracement of 90% to confirm.

1314 2018-08-11 22:21:50 The real problem is not insider trading per se, but market manipulation of stock, Markets that are lenient with insider trading allows all kinds of manipulation of stocks, and that's why they are less likely to attract investors.
1315 2018-08-11 22:21:07 Marc's grocery store chain seems hostile to vegan products.
Even when a company sells vegan and nonvegetarian versions of a product Marc's often won't sell the vegan.
For example the company stocks Old El Paso refried beans except the vegetarian version.
1316 2018-08-11 22:19:31 A few people have asked me about my top holdings and/or % so here they are across my ISA /SIPP as 10Aug :

1318 2018-08-11 22:18:07 Stocks are not debt. Those are bonds.
1319 2018-08-11 22:17:59 if going private is in any way serious, it's to allow for restructuring in such a way that it won't cause a domino effect. $TSLA  failing will lead to questions of valuations given to growth narrative stocks and then the wider market momentum being detached from actual growth.

1325 2018-08-11 22:08:35 Companies don’t buy back 109% of their stocks you fucking dope. Plus, for the 100% time, trickle down economics hasn’t been tried in a true free market. You can keep saying I’m stupid all you want, but until you show me evidence that it was a free market, that’s your problem.

1329 2018-08-11 22:01:32 everyone else who's stocks prices were manipulated? people who didnt get the same chance at acquiring wealth because they dont belong to the saggy white man club?
1330 2018-08-11 22:01:02 No logic? It makes perfect sense. You're not entitled to the companies treasury as a tokenholder unlike a stock so there's no reason why it should be apart of valuation. Icos do not report any financials to the public like stocks do as well, so how do we verify progress?
1331 2018-08-11 22:00:53 With all of the possible stocks, efts, commodities,  etc. available on all of the many exchanges in all of the trading countries, I hardly think it's coincidental.
1332 2018-08-11 21:58:00 It looks like you have the privilege of access to a grocery store that stocks quality fresh produce. That’s great, and I’m happy for you! However, not everyone has that acces. Supermarket chains have an ugly history of avoiding low-income neighborhoods.
1333 2018-08-11 21:56:21 what other stocks has he dumped? Criminals rarely get caught, the first time!
1334 2018-08-11 21:54:54 possible life goals: 
- work in stocks
- live in a box
- only eat lox
- own a pet fox
1335 2018-08-11 21:53:59 Yes but if getting caught dating happened now - it can affect mergers and stocks. Contracts for modeling etc. it would be not good.  Look at all the hate Jin got with that cohost.
1336 2018-08-11 21:51:54 It’s like comparing apples to oranges at the moment. How can you build an efficient algo for an asset that’s a few years old, vs many stocks that are 20+ years. Algo trading and TA require historical analysis. Stock market is $70T+, crypto less than$300B
1337 2018-08-11 21:50:01 REITS tend to perform better than growth stocks under two circumstances: 1.GDP slowing and 2. Inflation falling. commodities as an asset class are crashing. Owning REITS may be a defensive position into Q119
1338 2018-08-11 21:47:18 Im not saying change it but two stocks is probably the biggest reason a lot of randy upsets happen that probably would never happen w three stocks, along with one of the main urks i have w smash 4
1339 2018-08-11 21:46:39 Not enough money for food? Invest in stocks. You get free steak dinners at the shareholder's meetings.
1340 2018-08-11 21:46:32 a derelict warehouse. stocks of concrete line the walls. we accidentally startle a glass warbler.
1341 2018-08-11 21:45:49 Though timeout mus would be dragged out longer i think it would make people enjoy playing against certain characters a bit more. The reason some (or just me) people hate luigi is how being caught by his spinny hands take out 50% of your game early. With three stocks its only 33%.
1342 2018-08-11 21:45:01 Buying stocks? You mean, as stocks of provisions for the revolution? Beautiful and moral.
1343 2018-08-11 21:41:19 I f'n wish! I really hope that they are publically trading stocks. If so i might have to invest.
1344 2018-08-11 21:40:53 But i think you are right. At first the game was neutral heavy compared to now. 

I think 2 stocks was grandfarthered in. Its that because thats what it was. See also The awful stage list in PM.

1353 2018-08-11 21:27:27 3 stocks 8 mins could lessen the chances of rando upsets as well as giving someone who dies real early to come back instead of basically auto losing, especially with all the jank and things that kill at stupid low %.

1356 2018-08-11 21:21:48 My problem is that the person who runs my stocks told me this year I should try selling it and I don’t want to take advice from him bc I’m aware he’s wanting to buy it to make more money, and if he knows what he’s doing he must know my stock is going to increase in value soon
1357 2018-08-11 21:21:10 I suspect that China has already stopped making them, so good luck exercising your freedom to buy them once stocks have been sold in poundland.
1358 2018-08-11 21:20:51 Or if all you see are FAANGs.  What a run if one were to take big winnings in FAANG from the last 3-4 years and buy a portfolio of #uranium stocks.
1359 2018-08-11 21:20:00 New York congressman Chris Collins was indicted Wednesday for passing inside information on stocks to his son. The inside information was to just show up at the stock's office and ask for it to increase in value.
1360 2018-08-11 21:19:55 Why are representatives allowed to manage their own stocks? It’s such an obvious conflict of interest and a huge incentive to prioritize their own financial well being over the well being of their constituents.
1361 2018-08-11 21:19:49 #IfIHad24HoursLeft I’d go to @RayKurz house and ask him to upload me into the @CSAcasting @NYSE database and extol upon the casting director industry the correlation between casting Jim Meskimen and networks making $ in stocks!
1362 2018-08-11 21:19:14 That isnt true. You had your chance  and you failed. You know as little about why you disliked Obama as you know about why you like Trump.  Your life is and will always be pathetic. Enjoy being screwed over by Trump I'll make sure to invest in lubracant stocks.
1363 2018-08-11 21:18:44 It does, but most of that money isn't made by lending. Folks who made a fortune in finance do it through stocks, where it isn't as obvious where the exploitation is.  Like any long tailed distribution, you're gonna have a few crazy outliers, but it isn't clear what they did wrong

1367 2018-08-11 21:14:55 Still never understood why smash 4 is 2 stocks
1368 2018-08-11 21:12:55 shorting is not that different than selling in principle (and in practice)
in fact, to my knowledge, brokers that allow shorting will 'borrow' stocks and sell them on your behalf

would you consider it immoral to sell stocks you already own if you think a company is doing poorly?
1369 2018-08-11 21:12:50 2 stocks bo3 is also kinda random
1370 2018-08-11 21:10:23 I do programming and UI work, developing an entrepreneurial business plan around developing an app for Salesforce AppExchange, dabble in trading stocks, and love on my wife and two (soon to be three) kids.

1372 2018-08-11 21:08:33 Nothing short of full ban on foreign ownership.  Homes are not stocks.
1373 2018-08-11 21:08:28 What I am trying to illustrate, is neither KO punch, NOR limit, even remotely approach an unreactable screenwide kill button that is deadly at 20. It can't be knocked out, it sticks through stocks, and its literally rage 2.0. It builds primarily off receiving damage, not dealing.
1374 2018-08-11 21:05:32 Anyone who is going to damage our 401(k)s is not going to get elected. #Corporations do good things sometimes bad things but tens of millions depend on them. #Democrats own #stocks too.#RetirementPlanning #Retirement #wallstreet @LibDems @TheDemocrats @DNC
1375 2018-08-11 21:04:06 The effects of #IUUfishing can be seen in the world fish stocks and directly affect global food security and security threats, such as illegal #trafficking of #drugs, #weapons and #people. @FAOfish @S_I_F @wto @wef
1376 2018-08-11 21:03:04 I never once said it wasn't good. Not a single time. However, I can tell you that, right now, it appears it is artificial. A "super buyback" of stocks only. Which is typical of corporations to do when they are supplied a windfall injection of cash that they didn't earn

1380 2018-08-11 20:59:55 @farrisbaba hey, hope your weekend is going great. I just got back into the market this week after a looong layoff. Don't know how it got by without me. Was following your OSTK posts a few months back, you were taking heat. I got into a few stocks/options this week. Forgot OSTK!
1381 2018-08-11 20:59:40 Medical device stocks? This is not ok.  Is this why you wouldn’t debate? Why should Minnesotans watch you personally make millions from your vote in the senate off these stocks?
1382 2018-08-11 20:58:58 Exactly.  As example, stocks of Heath care coverage are at all time high since Obamacare was passed, Cigna, Aetna, Wellspoint. The money went there on the expense of everyone. Government approved.
1383 2018-08-11 20:58:40 I can concede that still lower is possible for TWTR, but I’m hedged by being short a basket of stocks including FB which I feel gives me time.  A little difference in style obviously, although I feel like I’ve learned a lot from Stewie in the past year when it comes to TA.
1384 2018-08-11 20:57:33 I've stayed away from the tesla debate as I don't trade indv stocks.  If I did, I wouldn't touch it.
1)How the hell do they burn through so much cash?
2)How the hell is this stock valued at 350ish a share?
3)How the hell are they going to service all that debt?
1385 2018-08-11 20:56:13 They’re going to do nothing and the only thing that’ll do is green light more C-suite people to say whatever the hell they want on twitter to move stocks.  Insane.
1386 2018-08-11 20:52:26 Yes. That’s the problem. You can use taxation to counter inflation when MPC is high (with C referring to purchase of newly produced goods and services, not C vs I). But as you let agents come to be with lower MPC income and rising buffer stocks, you weaken that capacity.
1387 2018-08-11 20:52:19 Stock market AND stocks
1388 2018-08-11 20:52:00 I watch twitter for investment ideas but do my own research. I completely avoid 90% of the stocks I see on twitter; occasionally, after my own DD, I find a good one. Just following the herd is expensive.
1389 2018-08-11 20:51:01 'Selective reply'? U have not addressed, ANYTHING about this admin Absolutely nothing. You've slandered A Franken, me, trashed Pres Obama, but no reply to anything, about DT's policies. Where is his health plan? Why no answers to do w/what he has done? What do you admire? Stocks?
1390 2018-08-11 20:49:59 Took 2 stocks from ML, made a few bad choices that cost me stocks.  Not too bad though
1391 2018-08-11 20:49:07 And I'm guessing nothing on the Q-Anon nut who started the California wildfire.
1392 2018-08-11 20:48:40 stock ticker, stock market, stocks,
1393 2018-08-11 20:47:20 but do note the implication: precisely because taxing the risk can’t relieve current inflationary pressure, the existence of people with large buffer stocks of income and/or wealth renders inflations likely to be more violent and difficult to control. so it’s not quite right to
1394 2018-08-11 20:47:19 Getting ready for some racing action at valley speedway tonight. B mods, e mods, vintage, pure stocks,  dirt demons, midgets, and ATVs.
1395 2018-08-11 20:46:51 You know it!
1396 2018-08-11 20:46:33 They also pumped and dumped, selling stocks under false pretenses.
1397 2018-08-11 20:46:15 Same time, same place
1398 2018-08-11 20:45:43 See you next weekend 
1399 2018-08-11 20:45:14 4/Stocks are doing well, so U DO excuse it all. S Franken, who asked for an invest, & apologized, resigned bc his party asked & shouldn't have, is 'a despicable pig', while DT trashes women who credibly accuse him, J Jordon lies about what he knew is OK w/U BC 'That's different'.
1400 2018-08-11 20:42:49 like money, stocks have a value that we all collectively agree on, but if everyone's using insider trading, no one can have faith that the stocks are worth what people say they are. without trust in the system, no one would invest.
1401 2018-08-11 20:42:46 Random beer musings....the government charges fees to help preserve and promote healthy fish stocks! At the same time, they allow big companies to dump milions of gallons of sewage and other pollutant shit into the ocean through the St. Lawrence River. Which kills said fish!WTF
1402 2018-08-11 20:41:21 It is not called diversification if all you have is crypto. you got it wrong. diversify your wealth into: euro, usd, gold, crypto (diversify some), unmovable assets, stocks (diversify some)! Last time BTC went from 7k to 10k, EOS went from 4 to 24 (6x in a month)

1413 2018-08-11 20:29:50 the only mistakes are 1) lack of diversity and 2) inadequate risk/yield vs retirement goal. IME day trading and picking stocks never works - we just don't know enough. If you have one, the indexed fund for your retirement goal is the best.
1414 2018-08-11 20:28:46 $SX $IDK $GRAT. MY normal Monday's n Thursday's routine is to drive my pups for playday, go to gym, out for breakfast, go to Costco and get home around 11AM. Check stocks, cut the grass, 2 hours, then check stocks. Monday I will be home in front of computer 
1415 2018-08-11 20:26:41 I heard on NPR that members of the U.S. Senate had 12% higher than average returns on stocks until they passed a rule that they had to report all trades.  That is unheard of.  All members of congress should have to place their investments in a blind trust.
1416 2018-08-11 20:24:15 Cool, but did you ask when Flint will have clean water? Or when the families he separated at the border will be reunited? Or how about when bump stocks will be banned? No? How about Puerto Rico? Maybe why everyone around him is a criminal? Omarosa, huh? Very important issue. Good
1417 2018-08-11 20:23:14 I had some of those stocks
1418 2018-08-11 20:22:45 wee intwana zam I love you guys my smile keeper's, laughing stocks

1420 2018-08-11 20:21:17 What about your other 3 stocks?
1421 2018-08-11 20:20:10 I am retired on soc sec and stocks in my IRA and regular account. Since trump's election, my stocks have gone down...now many are in loss positions. Don't believe what you hear on the news. Dow Jones is not all there is.
1422 2018-08-11 20:17:14 Well stocks are up and, "God is in the white house again" so I'm assuming they are all very happy
1423 2018-08-11 20:14:30 Donc c’est opération réussie vu que les stocks ont baissés 
1424 2018-08-11 20:14:06 Both sides played their part perfectly

1429 2018-08-11 20:12:47 It’s part of post ordination training, along with auctioning harvest produce, having cold sponges thrown at you while you are in the stocks, and the myriad other things that must be in the Bible somewhere though I’ve not found them xxx
1430 2018-08-11 20:12:29 1/Stocks inspird  reply, nothing else. Why? Not racism, trashg EPA, allies, the IC, conspiring w/a Foreign pwer, corruptn so deep it has already brought about resig of multiple people in the admin. NO mention of J Jordan, trumps abuse of women, pay-offs to 2, but U did insult AF.
1431 2018-08-11 20:11:49 Bought great stocks in the dip price though...
1432 2018-08-11 20:11:04 I guess we forgot about Lehman?

Am I mistaken for thinking that stocks need to be moved to cash accounts?

And when trades settle, are they held in an omnibus account, subject to lending and rehypothecation?

Been a while but some lessons you never forgot 

#lessonslearned
1433 2018-08-11 20:09:28 There’s no reason for them to hold ANY stocks unless they’re in a blind trust.
1434 2018-08-11 20:07:50 May our stocks rise high!
1435 2018-08-11 20:06:04 If Turkish banks go down by defaulting on loans, then some European banks could be subject to ‘contagion’. Move out of bank stocks and instead invest in this year’s wheat harvest.

1441 2018-08-11 20:03:40 Different worlds was a rhetorical device. Yes, my stocks are doing nicely. Do you have an IRA or other pension plan? Yours are, too. Affordable health care? My premiums more than doubled under Obama.

1455 2018-08-11 19:51:05 Crap!!! Poor conception. Stock classified into Growth & Value stocks change periodically. Can’t be extrapolated over 10-20 years to fit into his theory. Secondly, Selection bias i.e. underlying stocks play an important role. Author seems to have chosen stocks to prove his theory
1456 2018-08-11 19:50:06 Thought there was huge put buyers
1457 2018-08-11 19:48:08 Yes, I agree with all of this. Our taxes went down, and our stocks are doing well. However, our wages are stagnant and have been for about a decade. Trump has not helped wages at all.

1459 2018-08-11 19:46:29 Reasons why stocks are worth anything:
1) exits
2) dividend yields

Reasons why stocks go up:
1) people buy them
2) market makers take a cut
1460 2018-08-11 19:42:26 If you look at the history of the stock market, often new stocks of new technologies are often highly volatile. The process of price discovery is volatile because people are coming to understand something. Adoption is a process. Which will occur over time. Think of it in stages.
1461 2018-08-11 19:41:50 E.g. say US policy is fiscally irresponsible and leads to bad things. So why lend to US government and buy stocks, if it will all fail miserably soon? This is what bothers me. If something is so very bad (sad!), why are markets playing along?
1462 2018-08-11 19:41:33 As a life long Democrat I am concerned with Smith refusing to divest herself from her medical stocks, and I am absolutely against her amendment regarding land swaps to help PolyMet. This issues are proper subjects for a primary. I don't consider them "scorched earth".

1464 2018-08-11 19:40:36 1. Hedge yourself with #Bitcoin, Gold, Oil ..

1471 2018-08-11 19:33:27 From another life long Democrat, I am lost why she refuses to divest herself from industry stocks for an industry she hopes to legislate.  Why wouldn't she?
1472 2018-08-11 19:32:51 Man, if the SEC doesn't burn this SOB, I'm going to pull out of stocks and just invest in real estate. After all, we all know how honest mortgage brokers are
1473 2018-08-11 19:32:01 I think he bought stocks
1474 2018-08-11 19:30:37 Apart from the stocks kept in secure storage in the US and Russia.
1475 2018-08-11 19:30:01 Why would you sit on your hands when people are making money off stocks ? Now is the time to invest,not sit on your hands  SMH
1476 2018-08-11 19:28:29 So. You work hard to earn money. Invest it in stocks, mfunds, or it stays static. You work harder, try to earn more money. Emergencies happen, or just life happens and you land up spending a lot. Or stocks crash. Or you make a bad investigation. Or someone cheats you.
1477 2018-08-11 19:28:27 Stocks are so fucking boring, but at least they don’t bart.
1478 2018-08-11 19:27:26 @frdbwn ya, they're called low beta stocks
1479 2018-08-11 19:24:44 I thought Volkswagen stocks crashed  cuz of faulty cars? Prob should stay away from that one!
1480 2018-08-11 19:24:43 Funny because he stocks up on low cost sector ETFs, passively invests, then charges clients hedge fund fees.
1481 2018-08-11 19:24:24 Hey @RobinhoodApp,
Thanks for sending false warning messages to your customers yesterday.
Really needed this push to short sell my #NVDA stocks.
Much trust inspiring.
1482 2018-08-11 19:23:51 401Ks are a form of hostage negotiation. The poor/middle class get to invest small amounts of capital in stocks. The wealthiest people benefit from this. The poor only get the benefit if the rich are allowed to profiteer. Talk shit. Stocks crash. Poor lose money.

1484 2018-08-11 19:23:21 Don't hate me, but virtually every analysis I've seen from folks I trust is bearish as of Friday or this weekend.   Hopefully "the market" is not the same as your / my best stocks!
1485 2018-08-11 19:23:12 Check out the financial disclosure filings of your representative and two senators. I found a senator with millions in medical device stocks, and I am doing something about it.
1486 2018-08-11 19:22:52 Are you sure about that? You think the tax cuts and the trade wars will be positive for 90% off the people in the long run? Or might the allready very rich profit from these things by paying less taxes and getting more income from stocks and profits!?
1487 2018-08-11 19:21:14 And who knows how many hands those particular stocks went through before the price dropped.
1488 2018-08-11 19:20:24 If it were a Republican who had not traded stocks during the relevant time frame, that would also not be misleading.  Or an independent.  Or a communist.  Or a zebra.  It’s all about reading, really.
1489 2018-08-11 19:18:33 My understanding: Collins’ investigated through SDNY because it has to do with stocks. Evidently, investigations are automatically triggered when that kind of stock price collapse happens. Nunes malfeasance would be under Sessions’ purview & his only ethical move mandated by law
1490 2018-08-11 19:18:14 ^^^^ can't disagree with that.

1494 2018-08-11 19:14:34 1. Is a question.

There's no criticism, there's a challenge on the headline.

1505 2018-08-11 19:06:45 So according to you insider trading has no victims and makes the market more efficient. Have you taken economics 101 in highschool before writing this peace? The victims are those who were fraudulently sold the overpriced stocks by insiders and their friends and families.

1514 2018-08-11 18:57:25 Yes. You are right! The corporations and the rich guys/GOP donors buying back stocks and narrowing down the rich whenever the stocks plunges down from excess profit made from the 25% tax cut. Bravo!!!
1515 2018-08-11 18:56:58 This has caused the prices of stocks, bonds, real estate and most other assets to appreciate at rates that have no basis in the ongoing income/cash flow of the global economy. In short, they are wildly overvalued.

1542 2018-08-11 18:32:55 $study. This past week I lost discipline and took two trades that were outside my system both were bigger losers than the should have been.  So I closed down .89% on the week, which would have otherwise been a  big week. So again no more thin bio stocks for me.
1543 2018-08-11 18:31:55 Heck, I guess I’m naive, as I always thought that was the case. I mean it’s common sense. 
I just assumed once you become an elected official you can’t own stocks or anything of that nature that could be perceived as a potential conflict.
1544 2018-08-11 18:31:07 Thank immigration policies in large part for this huge & growing deficit!  Imagine how big this deficit will become if 20 million people r given amnesty & thus access to free government services. You can kiss US solvency good bye!  Liberals - this means your stocks r going down!

1550 2018-08-11 18:29:44 Why should advertising pay more than janitorial services, does it contribute to society more? Is trading stocks more important than food service? Does programming apps benefit society more than caring for the sick and elderly? We live in a society w/ its priorities all messed up
1551 2018-08-11 18:28:59 my twitter is so all over the place lol sneakers, sex, soccer, stocks.....i do like alliteration lol but seriously i must be ADD lmao
1552 2018-08-11 18:28:00 Markets are full of subjective noise.

When #Trading, I switch off that noise & look for the objective signals in charts.  

For me, that's the only way to be successful.

1554 2018-08-11 18:24:45 They cannot be, they cannot be deposited either same as you cannot transfer stocks to a brokerage too.

It's just a trading platform, you deposit USD and withdraw USD, same as with Bitmex where you can only deposit BTC and withdraw BTC.
1555 2018-08-11 18:21:12 Thats the reason the dow still on 25000.
Nobody selling there stocks.

1559 2018-08-11 18:18:01 @realDonaldTrump I am sick and tired of people bashing Trump. Stocks are up and people are working. ISIS is a thing of the past. When is the last time your heard anything about ISIS? Black unemployment is at it's lowest rate in decade's. North Korea is bowing down to us.

1562 2018-08-11 18:15:53 Who knows about stocks?  Do shareholders have to cast their vote proxy or can they attend meetings?  Is their a minimum share requirement?  I need to get @TezzmanianDevil in a @PapaJohns board meeting.
1563 2018-08-11 18:14:35 Absolutely... This why index is not coming down but stocks are trading near 52 weeks low..
1564 2018-08-11 18:14:17 This is just one that got caught. How many others are doing the same thing through different channels. Maybe it's time to ban all legislative, judiciary and executive members from buying and selling stocks while in office.
1565 2018-08-11 18:13:31 I am referring to why the shooting happened.  As for since, I am proud of what we passed in Florida.  At a minimum, the rest of the nation should follow.  We can also fix the background check system and we should ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
1566 2018-08-11 18:13:26 What other stocks do you like?

1571 2018-08-11 18:06:21 Depending what stocks
1572 2018-08-11 18:04:52 What about the 6 GOPers that bought the stocks?
1573 2018-08-11 18:01:01 On Volkswagen, look at Kodakcoin and what it did to it's stocks.  Lots of companies are jumping on the blockchain hype.  Also remember that this is the company that cheated out of emission regulations.  Bosch was also involved in that and they bought some IOTA late last year.

1576 2018-08-11 17:59:35 Taxing land is thought to not have negative side effects in the economy, but I don’t see why that shouldn’t be the case. Yes, it doesn’t affect the supply of land, but if taxed heavily it will move investments from land to bonds and stocks which are harder to tax.
1577 2018-08-11 17:58:28 Same here. Only one shop that stocks the uniform. The boys wear a suit as opposed to a blazer so it’s not as if I can save money getting trousers from somewhere else. So expensive as well
1578 2018-08-11 17:58:04 Even worse: great businesses deserving a ‘buy’ go into their sell bucket for two other reasons: 1) stock isn’t big cap / doesn’t trade enough / doesn’t bring IB revenue or 2) incompetence of the analysts (often!). So the BUYs are: 1) fee generating stocks. 2) who knows why
1579 2018-08-11 17:57:04 bts concert time. idk why i tell you this. maybe i hope a little part of you will think of us alil bit. why we act so tough toward others. but if you really thought wht im just complaining is laughable stocks, then okay i hope you have a good laugh and a good day
1580 2018-08-11 17:57:00 #Stocks  On this date in 2004, Blockbuster launched its online movie rental business, 6 years after Netflix.  By 2010, the company was bankrupt. Blockbuster made the mistake of thinking Netflix was simply a "flash in the pan."  Never underestimate your competition. #Stocks

1592 2018-08-11 17:48:07 1. I’m 41 this year, started trading at 22 and 5 years I did, FX, FUTURES, EQUITIES and I almost bankrupted myself at 27...I joined the banks for 3 years before I started my first business at 30, I swore to myself I will never trade or even buy stocks...
1593 2018-08-11 17:47:12 Florida baby  You would be surprised how many people down here talk about cryptocurrencies but always say they pulled out and hate it. this guy last night said he only will invest in stocks never coins again  I found out later the only exchanges they use is coinbase

1597 2018-08-11 17:43:17 Is it owing to royalty to their parent company (Suzuki) which is adversely impacting margins ? Minority shareholders are no longer happy with only volume. They want volume plus margin - at least for expensive stocks like Maruti.
1598 2018-08-11 17:42:08 They're signaling their side. Stocks are like sports teams for a good chunk of readers nowadays. (Why else would every $TSLA article get 400 comments?) No different than someone writing "Go Bulls!" in the comments of a sports article.

1601 2018-08-11 17:41:15 One thing these opposing you don't understand is this is a repeat in US economic history. Lotso corps used tax cuts to buy back their stocks. Middle & lower class drive the economy. Corps/rich increase hiring when economy is good. Most job openings are for college graduates (1)
1602 2018-08-11 17:40:49 Allows poor  people to work? Wtf . They aren't creating jobs but rather buying back stocks.

1607 2018-08-11 17:38:05 Let me clarify that, some forms of stocks & shares are compatibable with God's word and some are or Satan, When Jesus spoke of investing the talints the moral ones, he uses the example of the investment of money & the model is there to see in the historical practices of the day

1614 2018-08-11 17:32:32 We don't have positions. Pure research and unbiased... we do not hold shares and are not paid to pick a stock. We don't say when to sell (everyone is different), we just pick stocks that go up. We post picks and research on them.
1615 2018-08-11 17:31:46 An improvement in the stock market disproportionately benefits the wealthiest members of the US. The top 20% own 92% of stocks, therefore pointing to the stock market as an example of effective “trickle-down” is invalid.
1616 2018-08-11 17:31:33 I mean yeah but basically every store that stocks meat and dairy will also stock basic fruit / veg / beans / legumes / nuts etc... and most people do have access to those foods they just choose to eat meat instead / as well. Obviously for people who don't have access (e.g if

1619 2018-08-11 17:30:13 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim

1624 2018-08-11 17:27:05 "Little mac has KO punch isnt that the same as final smashes?"

Mac traded his aerials + recovery for KO. It gets knocked out, lost between stocks, isn't screenwide, doesnt work in the air, and kill percents are nerfed come ultimate. You dont wanna put that(+more) on Bayos kit.
1625 2018-08-11 17:26:52 They can have retirement and investment funds but never control them and shouldn’t control exactly which stocks are in them.
1626 2018-08-11 17:26:47 Depends on how he trades.  He may have a lot more high risk, on be an individual stock trader but 401k's are pretty much down because of how their stocks are dispersed.
1627 2018-08-11 17:24:58 All the results of the Obama administration, lowest interest rates in history and the printing of more money - know as quantitative easing. It also needs to be understood that the major reason stocks are rising are because the companies are buying back their own stock, not you.
1628 2018-08-11 17:24:35 Peter said buying stocks is buying future earnings. $AMZN $GOOG & $NFLX generate positive earnings. Dividends are only a by-product of earnings. Investors buy stocks for future earnings as that is an inherent purpose of business. What inherent earnings can $BTC ever offer?

1633 2018-08-11 17:16:16 The reason this argument is terrible is cloud traded his recovery and mac traded all of his aerials AND his recovery. Macs Ko punch can be knocked out of him, has very limited range, and doesnt carry over between stocks. This take is misguided as all hell.
1634 2018-08-11 17:16:03 With the Emerging market crashing...the US dollar that have break on the upside I'm scared to death about my gold/silver stocks....I really hope you will be right Tord.....but it's not easy to be bullish on PM nowadays.

you think i was joking when i made my first public bearish call on $VET?

1644 2018-08-11 17:10:08 I am mostly referring to the lower and lower yields on financial assets like CDs and money markets. Many older retirees don’t emphasize equities. Now, stock dividends are lowering. It will force many retirees into more stocks which means more risk. That’s the assault.

1649 2018-08-11 17:04:41 Maybe "penny stocks". Unless you're rich, big tech stocks (FANG) are basically worthless. Do you know how small dividends are? literally pennies per share. Do you know how huge those companies would have to be to get significant capital gains? They would need 3,4,5 trillion mktcp
1650 2018-08-11 17:03:26 Thank you... that was poor sportsmanship by Stocks.. had it just happen during the game fine.. but needing to foul when you have already won pretty much.. then call a TO and draw up a play.. that's crap.. and i hope Curt tells his team to run thr score up honestly..

1661 2018-08-11 16:48:51 @HiddenPivots hey brother don’t take this the wrong way please. I don’t know what happens to you with MDXG and OSTK. But you use to have good information and good charts ideas now is like all I read is those two tickets and a wrath of emotion like you get married to those stocks.
1662 2018-08-11 16:48:36 TONIGHT ONLY: Artwork's by Jeff Jacob's Custom Replica Models from BAPS Motor Speedway is giving a $50 Hard Charger to Pure Stocks and $10 to the first 5 Pure Stocks from BAPS Speedway to enter the gates TONIGHT!
1663 2018-08-11 16:47:37 I found Why Stocks Go Up and Down by William Pike as one of the best book for beginners. author taught the introductory investment course sporsored by the Boston Security Analyst s Society for more than 20 years. The early editions of this book are the outgrowth of that course
1664 2018-08-11 16:46:46 Just see in 5 years both the stocks! But u can't imagine a stock like IB ventures once a bad stock with loss making and traded at 25, today 700+ in just 2-3 years!
1665 2018-08-11 16:45:52 We are talking about stocks and all I said was it would seem you own stock being a CEO what in the world does that have to do with lobby
1666 2018-08-11 16:44:36 Then again you should shut up and report on business and leave the Trump relay messages to Fox news. I don't think anyone knows why your reporting on sports issues other than stocks and profits & loss.
1667 2018-08-11 16:44:25 Saying good bye to Chris Collins is a good. I say it’s throwing away the dirty bath water. He’s ethically challenged&he’s been caught helping family sell stocks b4 value plunged. These Repugs admin. r ethically challenged. Vote in democrats to be a check on prez’s power.
1668 2018-08-11 16:44:09 Very true. And Buffet is obviously widely successful. However his simplistic style might not work in the future. What seems to be fueling stocks now (some of which are double topped) are trade wars which the US is presumably winning propping up the $ against the Lira/Yuan/Peso
1669 2018-08-11 16:43:36 what I thought all tech stocks and particularly FANG are cheap no????
1670 2018-08-11 16:43:07 @richardquest Richard, my sister and I miss you on CNN. Do you only report on plane crashes and stocks?
1671 2018-08-11 16:43:05 Manish, are you a seller of emerging market stocks?
1672 2018-08-11 16:42:18 If this plays out in August OMCs might give bullish reversal in monthly charts too and that after 50% Fibonacci retracement of 2013-2017 rally.
Most OMC stocks trading at 4-5% dividend yield.

1674 2018-08-11 16:39:43 Well Robinhood is about stocks. I don’t invest in assets only.
1675 2018-08-11 16:38:04 There will be a few stocks onhand u can reserve them now
1676 2018-08-11 16:35:58 I just find it funny people actually take the time to attempt hating on quality but say nothing about the other 99% that are completely dilutive turds in the OTC...like of all the stocks being pumped right now in the OTC this is what bothers you? Open your eyes.
1677 2018-08-11 16:34:41 Amara Raja, Glenmark, Wipro, SunPharma, RBLBank are 5 of my favorite stocks to trade. My point is I never feel uncomfortable when trading them, rarely look at the positions, more time spent watching every tick, the better.
1678 2018-08-11 16:33:39 *sharpens pitchfork*
*stocks up on torches*
1679 2018-08-11 16:33:05 Bout that time i bring my friends to the round table and we discuss investments, stocks etc ,and monopolize and take over,I’ve never been about self, we have to start opening our ears and listening to each other’s ideas ,spread wealth, generational wealth was the plan i thought..
1680 2018-08-11 16:32:00 There could be a deductible amount, a low amount like a half million dollars in which no tax is charged. The big item will be the multi million dollar bank accounts. Money and assets in stocks and bonds etc.
1681 2018-08-11 16:31:33 Money and time. This sort of low price/big stocks climate will encourage more infrastructure but it will not happen overnight. And, to Pete’s point some companies have struggled even in high crush margin environments due to inefficiency’s and (quite frankly) market losses.
1682 2018-08-11 16:30:17 Mark half the grouse moors I know have cancelled because inclement weather cause a bad breeding year ........ I’d say that in its self is conservation . We are conserving the stocks we have
1683 2018-08-11 16:28:10 Sucks for the investors who would have bought those stocks, though.
1684 2018-08-11 16:27:52 The explanation that the Chinese have a permanent buy order at a specific Yuan price makes much more which gives gold a descending floor, but no ceiling.  China buying gold like the Swiss CB using worthless paper to buy dividend paying stocks will create havoc in any downturn.
1685 2018-08-11 16:27:02 Versus-because CNN “says so”. Get some facts, get some evidence, and while you’re on that mystical journey why don’t you go ahead and pick yourself up a clue. I believe your breed of moron has stocks of them at Amazon. Assuming you can click that many buttons with a purpose.
1686 2018-08-11 16:25:16 I dunno  

Retired from 1st career, working full time in 2nd.

Receiving pension from #1 for almost a decade; building smaller secondary one.

Largest savings of our lives, 65% stocks, mostly MF, lot of S&P 500.

Realize many have issues, but assault comment was nuts 
1687 2018-08-11 16:24:42 Nope, that’s a fallacy that is being borne out right before our eyes. Lower taxes means corporations buy back stocks. They dont create jobs. The small amount of increase to the average person is wiped out by inflation.
1688 2018-08-11 16:24:35 100% agree! Dollar has been King!. Stocks & Forex have been explosive while Crypto has been in depression

However, nobody on Twitter seems to care much about Stocks and they definitely don't care about Forex

Unless you have been "ON IT", go & come back when the Bear hibernates

1690 2018-08-11 16:22:24 To the best of my knowledge, over the past one year only few selected stocks have performed, HDFC Bank, TCS, Reliance, Kotak Mahindra. Rest many new stocks have been introduced and many old have been withdrawn, they'll take some time before giving returns. BSE sensex is a bogey
1691 2018-08-11 16:21:11 trump doesn't care about the Market...he doesn't own stocks...Hurry Up Mueller and lock this POS up
1692 2018-08-11 16:21:01 STORMY Daniels?   KAREN McDugal ?   And this President has the nerve to throw stones?   Oh Of course it is distraction time yet another Trump cabinet member charged. Chris Collins used WH to make big bucks on stocks.  No draining the swamp
1693 2018-08-11 16:20:04 Of course, they don't want anyone else getting any while they're busy scooping it all up because they know it really is the next great thing.  Trash it to the point of shaking people out of there positions so they can buy it up. Did the same with tech stocks when they were new.
1694 2018-08-11 16:17:40 potek ako din. they might run out of stocks

1697 2018-08-11 16:16:16 Mainly stocks but sometimes Forex when I see the right pattern forming on th chart. I see you are a foodie, what is  your specialty?
1698 2018-08-11 16:15:43 Penny stocks FTW
1699 2018-08-11 16:15:35 I can’t confirm but it’s been suggested to me that our domestic crush ceiling is roughy 2.1b bu. If that’s the case it wouldn’t matter if China wanted to import our meal, we wouldn’t be able to increase production and our bean stocks just sit where they are.
1700 2018-08-11 16:15:16 Fact that some time is referred to as alt-season, and there are daily tweets 

about coins that are absolutely going 10x-100x, should scare you. 

This is the type of herd mentality you see in dead penny stocks on

1705 2018-08-11 16:13:07 Seeing great improvements in trading.  Trading journal tells me it’s bcuz:
1-Focusing on stocks w/ catalysts & VOLUME
2-Cutting losses ridiculously fast. Just moving on if it doesn’t start winning immediately.
3-Prepping list of stocks @ 6:30am & sometimes using pre-market trades
1706 2018-08-11 16:12:22 Into the stocks!
1707 2018-08-11 16:11:01 3 rd test will Ben stocks do it
1708 2018-08-11 16:11:01 The fact is if we are to make the country truly support the interest of its citizens Wall Street will see losses in insurance stocks, prison stocks and drops in weapons manufacturing that pumps up out bloated military. It’s got to happen.

1710 2018-08-11 16:09:21 @NancyPelosi @USAGSessions @realDonaldTrump - Dear Pelosi: I sure would love to have YOU set me up for a gigantic stock market gain I want millions! Set up some stocks for me like YOUR VISA Windfall!!!!!!!!
1711 2018-08-11 16:09:10 all of Russia's chemical stocks were destroyed, verified by the OPCW, the same is not true for the US, perhaps u should address your concerns to Washington or even Porton Downs
1712 2018-08-11 16:08:44 thats IF the company which you own stocks from survives though, the economy obviously has to survive bc the govt will bail everyone out but if your stocks dont make it then you lose if the company does then most likely yeah youll make a profit but thats
1713 2018-08-11 16:08:22 Thanx, i'll have a look & see what they have. There's gotta be somewhere this side of the Atlantic that stocks what I want lol 
1714 2018-08-11 16:07:21 90% CT are panic sellers they won’t understand, they just look at day to day price and sell. You got to have strong hands  to achieve financial freedom in crypto or stocks..... if we don’t panic sell our positions we would b up no matter what... who cares #iamnotpanicselling
1715 2018-08-11 16:05:49 it’s investing stocks and like crypto currency apps, look into them sis!
1716 2018-08-11 16:05:20 Yep they closed out in 2016. 200$ for a pict is ridiculous. I will get you the name of the stocks Angel Rose uses. Sexy not erotica.
1717 2018-08-11 16:05:13 I rarely sell stocks -- especially ones with good size long-term gains -- but in the hour after Elon Musk's tweet this week I sold my shares of Tesla. Maybe 10-15% more upside on the table if a buyout were to materialize at $420, but the downside was too much
1718 2018-08-11 16:05:11 Since so many defensive options have been significantly nerfed, and dodging being super unsafe offstage, i can see edge guarding ending stocks way faster
Also, the universal landing lag of aerials being reduced kinda helps too
1719 2018-08-11 16:04:56 If Emirates Airlines stocks alcohol on its flights Elli Holman is at liberty to be served an alcoholic drink. Why dont Dubai authorities complain to  the airline instead of picking on the passenger??

1729 2018-08-11 15:57:09 Well Mother Nature wins today I was looking forward to going to either Wings & Wheels at the Waterford Speedbowl or the jbh 100 for the granite state Pro stocks Monadnock Speedway. Raining in Connecticut and New Hampshire WTF they both got rained out.

1732 2018-08-11 15:54:54 Tell about some name of Penny stocks currently which became multibegger in future..?
1733 2018-08-11 15:54:18 You know what I hate most about stocks? How easily things can take a tumble and not recover. Look at Myspace that was sold for 500 million then everybody stopped using it and investors got it for 40 million. Look at Snapchat.
1734 2018-08-11 15:53:31 A few year ago, the US had an ending #soybean stocks number of 92 million bushels....USDA projecting 785 million for 2018/19.....ppl crazy talking about 1 Billion bushel soybean ending stocks ...how the world has changed

Therefore one needs to be careful while trading these stocks.
1741 2018-08-11 15:44:08 How quickly we forget what state the country was in, I guess it would've been better to let people starve or resort to crime? Anyhow the biggest stock buy back in history has done great for my stocks and 401k. Fuck the middle class and wages going down. I'm doing fine
1742 2018-08-11 15:43:24 I ain’t even know she knew anything about stocks. She like I shouldn’t have sold my whole food stocks and start asking about a few other stocks like amazon asking if I got any shares.
1743 2018-08-11 15:42:13 Ahh yes......about Trump`s agenda.go where the monies R....The Stocks Exchange...
1744 2018-08-11 15:40:59 I don't think the Fed's actions with short term rates have anything to do with long term rates...  there is massive liquidity in system (mostly stocks now) that will move to US treasuries at some point. Also, foreign countries always buy US bonds when fear hits their markets...
1745 2018-08-11 15:40:57 Among Bank Nifty stocks , AXIS stock shows bullishness and it can move further upwards in the coming weeks.
1746 2018-08-11 15:39:14 Buy appliancesBig discount sale days

Buy Stocks During Price corrections

AvoidMediocre businesses/buying for the sake of price corrections
1747 2018-08-11 15:38:45 Guessing stocks correctly for sure 
1748 2018-08-11 15:37:53 I remember 2008. I also "remember" stock market crash, but that's more so bc every day my dad  had Jim Cramer on and he'd shout about how bad stocks were doing lmao
1749 2018-08-11 15:37:29 Not only good earnings but its also a low float and a previous runner. Also you have shorts squeezing and chasers pushing this stock up. Stocks like these like to repeat themselves.
1750 2018-08-11 15:36:53 This is true for small insider bets that trade off marginal fluctuations. But this particular case was a ton of stocks sold immediately before a huge, fast-moving crash. Somebody discreet got stuck with those losses, largely because I assume nobody could sell a crashing stock.
1751 2018-08-11 15:34:38 I hope. Was never a fan of crypto. Way too volatile. Other smarter choices for passive income or investments stocks real estate gold etc.
1752 2018-08-11 15:33:14 When I read about the downward pressure on stocks by Boomers selling their assets in retirement, I ask, wouldn't this affect fixed income more? (Given recommended asset allocation for those in retirement)

1757 2018-08-11 15:31:59 Tesla going private is an F you to Wall Street. It is one of the stocks with the most volume of trades. Huge option spreads. Short sales and margin interest. Wall Street will be the biggest loser here. Trading private equity for public is an easy trade. $tsla

1760 2018-08-11 15:29:44 There needs to be structured reform of what Members of Congress/Executive Branch, etc. can and cannot do with relations to stocks./companies  The first should be a ban of certain government officials banned from being on corporate boards.
1761 2018-08-11 15:29:21 Short selling is easy money for Wall Street firms. That’s why they encourage this flawed strategy. They take your shares without you knowing. Sell them to someone else. Charge interest. They don’t give to the customer who shares they took. And get commissions on the stocks too.
1762 2018-08-11 15:28:59 So he thinks the UK will be ok cos it produces 60% of food stocks, wonder who the 40% are who will starve?
1763 2018-08-11 15:28:46 A trader dealing with futures would be better off tracking few stocks, being aware of their ranges, how they react to certain news events rather than searching for new stocks hoping to find opportunities every where, a major edge lies in knowing your domain very well.

1771 2018-08-11 15:20:04 Also, since the tax cut has been in place, many corporations have been buying back stocks instead of investing in people. (i.e. Caterpillar company)

Next eco. policy -trade war/tariffs:
Farmers need a bailout. 
Companies are moving or laying people off. (Same ex: Caterpillar)
1772 2018-08-11 15:19:58 Social security 401k may not be around in 30 years. Better to build up your account and invest in good stocks now.

1783 2018-08-11 15:13:49 No doubt there are many stocks making new yearly and all time highs.  However, the point of the narrow leadership crowd is that 5 stocks represent 90%plus of the sp500 total mkt cap increase  .  Therefore the remaining 495 net out to near 0 mkt cap change.
1784 2018-08-11 15:13:00 I get your concern. The stocks are updated by the sellers on our website. Do keep an eye on the website for further update. ^IF
1785 2018-08-11 15:13:00 Yet, you're on here complaining instead of deleting your account so their stocks can go down.
1786 2018-08-11 15:12:15 When top rates were cut (to 70% by LBJ in '68/ WWII debt paid off) we had stagflation, and when cut to 50%->28% (Reagan) -> 39% Bush, $ left Main St for asset purchases by rich (stocks, lux houses), and the link keeping Econ coherent was destroyed. Now only ~15% GDP for Main St!

1790 2018-08-11 15:08:48 You are destroying the environment. Education is declining. You have alienated our allies and want to destroy US democracy so you can be a rich, fat, oligarch. You didn’t ban bump stocks and did nothing for infrastructure. You locked up kids. #resist

1807 2018-08-11 14:56:59 When people sell something on instagram, they used comment feature to update the stock. And i didn't get notice when the stocks are sold out. Poor me ...
1808 2018-08-11 14:55:46 A story I’d like to see:

Interviews with the people who BOUGHT the stocks that Chris Collins dumped — and got stuck with the huge losses he would have endured if not for insider knowledge.

This isn’t an abstract (alleged) crime.   Somebody got screwed. What’s their story?
1809 2018-08-11 14:52:38 A friend of mine who worked on EU fisheries policy for years says that even if Brexit happens we would probably want something pretty close to the common fisheries policy anyway, because of the nature of the beast (fish stocks move...)

How many times Did you give Trump a heads up about stocks?
 Did Trump tell you before he tweeted something bad about a company before their stock took a hit?
1822 2018-08-11 14:42:52 Your suppose to buy in when its low and sell high. Its already gone up 10$ bucks since I've bought it. If you fail to realize that stocks go up and down, which Facebook does but always recovers its your lose.
1823 2018-08-11 14:42:43 I sure hope they cash out before the trade war brings about another stock market crash. Not much of a fortune to be had when the crash makes your stocks worthless.
1824 2018-08-11 14:41:49 We’ll continue with the bullish trend. S&P 500 SPX, -0.71%  didn’t close below its 20day moving average in a month, and it is nearing the all-time highs at 2,870. Stocks are modestly priced as economy continues growing. Stocks are giving the best returns overall.
1825 2018-08-11 14:39:44 @jimcramer I'm reading your Real Money book and hunting for undiscovered stocks. What are your thoughts on $OPRX? #MadTweets #MadMoney #CleanBalanceSheet #NoDebt
1826 2018-08-11 14:39:38 Yes, mind boggling. I remember reading how SNB has been buying FANG and making a killing. There is something fundamentally wrong when you can create money with a keystroke and then buy stocks and claim you made money. If that's the case, printing money would make everyone rich.
1827 2018-08-11 14:39:29 Stocks and payers?
1828 2018-08-11 14:39:24 Bout to really start learning about stocks 
1829 2018-08-11 14:38:55 Josh - I'm OK with select dividend stocks, but will only hold in my IRA.  It amazes me how many people think dividends are 'free money' and aren't deducted from per share price.  I prefer buybacks, assuming of course the company is smart about them.
1830 2018-08-11 14:38:33 Because our local herrings were fished out. I think the East coast fisheries have managed to build up stocks again.

1835 2018-08-11 14:36:54 You can not even read properly. The fund holds less than than 4% gas or oil related stocks. There was a recommendation for re balancing of exposerto energy the sector mainly to their Statoil stake. No word of dumping oil or gas stocks as the outperformed the market as well.
1836 2018-08-11 14:36:43 Kevin, first off: Have studied your work for YEARS. Keep up the great sharing of stocks and markets knowledge!  2nd.  Got this data from "40 Great Stock Market Winners."

1839 2018-08-11 14:34:25 Yes.  The Ben Graham chapter is very interesting.  The returns from GEICO eclipsed all of his other stocks.  But he didn't sell when it was no longer deep value.  Very ironic.  A person associated with deep value investing held what became a growth stock.

1867 2018-08-11 14:06:46 Per Bloomberg: Fear of contagion this week not limited to emerging mkts. With significant exposure to Turkey, Europe bank stocks were slammed in Friday trading. Unicredit sank 4.7% and ING Groep fell 4.3%. The big German banks, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, dropped 4.1% and 3.5%
1868 2018-08-11 14:05:54 Exactly the point most progressives make. If you can't afford to buy stocks, the stock market numbers don't help you. What really impacts you is wage growth, and since the #TaxScam wages haven't kept up with inflation, on average real buying power has gone down.
1869 2018-08-11 14:05:11 EU fleets had bigger fishing boats than UK, UK quotas reduced the amount of fishing possible.

1890 2018-08-11 13:47:45 John, BINGO.  For me it is the quality US Jrs that will rise like the phoenix. So the wrong ones to sell at this time. Many will go to the ETF for safety but many may not really know they are buying Daewoo or some of the others in the ETF and far less U stocks. So, both are right
1891 2018-08-11 13:47:34 If “everyone” you know lost “everything”, it was due to what occurred PRIOR to those 8 years. If you invested in stocks at beginning of Obama’sterm, your $$ would have grown 254%. So you may blame BUSH as he caused recession NOT Obama. Learn some history.

1895 2018-08-11 13:45:41 It’s not a concern guys, I was just saying that stocks are low following the mass power outage in Colwyn Bay last night, something the store couldn’t do anything about!
1896 2018-08-11 13:44:47 No, stocks can be valued many ways. Amazon, for instance, never shows a profit and its one of the best performers on the stock market.
1897 2018-08-11 13:44:34 I have a basic question. Nifty and Bank Nifty movements are based on underlying stocks and in that case how nifty and Bank Nifty charts would be relevant to look upon for technicals ? Shouldnt all do that in underlying stocks alone!?
1898 2018-08-11 13:43:31 What a great example of wisdom applied incorrectly. So, is dollar cost averaging only truly/mostly effective for dividend-paying stocks? Or better, stocks with earnings?

1903 2018-08-11 13:37:56 Not according to a few people I know that made thousands off it over the past two years. Stocks are a VERY volitile thing. They have ups and downs and are not always predictable, but sometimes taking chances can get you results. Many big companies have investors taking chances.

1907 2018-08-11 13:35:49 FOC knows what’s happening with the cod stocks
1908 2018-08-11 13:33:52 I really couldn't tell you! I'm running my stocks down before my trip away. Maybe some sort of pasta. Hopefully not with any more fish.
1909 2018-08-11 13:31:59 First, stocks removed have outperformed afterward in certain timeframes (see Arnott, 2018), second, if a company is acquired or goes out of business, how would you keep its stock included in an index?
1910 2018-08-11 13:30:00 Be cautious on TVS stocks.. Its chairman is linked in idol theft case.. He already got bail on Thursday.. When case  hearing starts, stocks may react
1911 2018-08-11 13:29:24 And do we know anyone who might have stocks in said contractors
1912 2018-08-11 13:27:21 It looks like those stock prices were “Made in China” and like everything else made in China, it’s fake, phoney, fraudulent, smokey, completey corrupt, morally bankrupt, and comes with that quintessentially chinese cultural fake face. The scam is up, and the stocks are down.
1913 2018-08-11 13:26:47 Shhhhhhhhhhh. You’ll get strung up or put in the stocks

1918 2018-08-11 13:24:52 This chart, cited by ZH, shows that correlation between stocks and bonds is the most negative (normal) since Nov. 2017
1919 2018-08-11 13:23:17 $13 to bale, $2 to rake, $25 to do it all, 5 foot by 66-68 inch bales, now depending on every else the price might range a bit, explain if I’m doing corn stocks and it takes more wrap prolly another $1, in a regular grad bale I have just a shade over a $1 in net wrap.
1920 2018-08-11 13:22:20 Mr: Sivanath from @MorningstarInc tells the enthusiastic audience at IIT Kanpur about ETFs being a global phenomenon as opposed to an investment in Indian markets. ETFs bridge the gap between investments in mutual funds and the trading features of stocks. #mbaiitk #iitkanpur
1921 2018-08-11 13:21:31 Really?  Dig deeper. What’s the state of the US economy when Bush left in Jan/09?  Bush left a recession, 7.9 unemployment, $1 Trillion Deficit for his last budget, financial crisis, millions lost jobs, 2 wars, real estate collapsed, stocks market crashed, etc.....
1922 2018-08-11 13:21:21 But you drove A stocks. Surely the deadmans on them were harder work.

1930 2018-08-11 13:13:59 The US is sitting on and can access more energy stocks than anybody in the world and we are a net exporter. What benefit do we get from Iraq's oil?
1931 2018-08-11 13:13:48 Bitcoin has doubled in price every year outdoing Apple & Amazon stocks. However, it’s only been around since 2009 
1932 2018-08-11 13:13:22 Why is Bitcoin dropping?
1. Underlying trouble in world stock markets “propping up” failing stocks but hidden from public view
2. Unscrupulous hidden US$ printing
3. Massive inflation in progress but hidden from public view giving illusion “all is well”

That’s a start
1/2
1933 2018-08-11 13:12:38 I honestly think with all of their stocks dropping. They are going to shut these platforms down. With taxpayer money to cushion the blow. Just a thought.
1934 2018-08-11 13:11:50 Just for your own sake, I tweet way more about football than I do about stocks. You may not like following me lol.

1942 2018-08-11 13:03:36 奏コインのこの例はいい例、エアドロ基本でホルダーを獲得することの不利さが露呈している。

今後もずっとCoin exchangeとかStocks exchangeみたいな金さえ払えばなんとでもなる取引所に上場を続けるなら良いけど、CoinExとかはたまたBINANCEとか目指したいなら冷静になるべきだね
1943 2018-08-11 13:03:11 I don't need to find stocks that multibag in days/weeks to achieve big returns. Most people overlook smaller returns compounded thinking they need to find that one "moonshot" stock. For example, two 40% returns = 96% return, four 20% returns = 107% return.
1944 2018-08-11 13:02:13 need supplier na madami supply as in dli same sa supplier ko na halos mag kaubos2 na stocks murag retailer raaaaa
1945 2018-08-11 13:01:42 But how to weed out the shitcoins? Stock exchanges have criteria and a process for delisting poorly performing stocks and those of companies that are not in compliance.

IMO crypto-exchanges need to adopt a universal set of guidelines in this regard.
1946 2018-08-11 13:01:29 But a single EFT that holds 500 stocks is pretty diverse.

1949 2018-08-11 12:59:43 10/month? What a stark contrast to the 200/paycheck mine is. (400/mo) so unless you make 5/hr your full of it. Retirement too, better get into some better stocks. Mine has gone up by 1/3.. it would just be horrible if you admitted you were financially better off. Smh
1950 2018-08-11 12:56:43 Agree. Investing in stocks&shares, working with brokers&hedge funds used to be an opportunity for the elite only. Crypto market allowed ordinary people to invest directly and reap profits. Wolves of Wall Street with 25years of experience don't like that. @mo_lazarus
1951 2018-08-11 12:56:36 And by the way, @GovernorVA , please divest your dirty Dominion Energy stocks. Owning them taints you. Thanks.

1954 2018-08-11 12:48:21 I have heard this said about stocks that go to zero.
1955 2018-08-11 12:47:08 At Jiffy Lube today and they had CNN on. Headline on TV screen says, “TRUMP TURKEY TARIFFS HURT STOCKS,” and the brainless Democrat sitting next to me says, “WTF, now Trump’s gonna take away Thanksgiving from poor people by putting a tariff on turkey dinners.” I kid you not. 
1956 2018-08-11 12:40:17 Kids are like stocks they’re risky but they pay themselves of in the end. The cycle of life is continued. Look at the greater picture and not the temporary pain.
1957 2018-08-11 12:39:41 I just think that investing through thick & thin might not work in cyclical stocks where timing plays a key role in deciding your returns.

3. You buy a flat in Istanbul 

4. TRY falls -26%

1966 2018-08-11 12:18:44 can you name some stocks which would create good wealth
1967 2018-08-11 12:18:28 You need median. Average does not make sense. In fact, that’s the whole point. Average will be higher simply by a few stocks making outsized moves.

1971 2018-08-11 12:14:43 52-weekish lows on international stocks gets me excited for some tax optimization opportunities.

1994 2018-08-11 11:38:51 I understand the logic behind that but the corporations that obtained tax cuts did not have a moral obligation to increase jobs or employee wages. They pumped stocks temporarily. The 401k people have is also at risk of market manipulation, unfortunately.

1998 2018-08-11 11:27:49 @MebFaber hit it on the head with his blog post discussing “outcome bias” (falsely assuming an decision was good based on the outcome) and illustrating the need to compare the other investment options when not in US stocks if you are using valuations via CAPE.

2048 2018-08-11 10:07:06 Just curious. When do shorts become “investors”? I am kind of newbie in stocks. Please explain.
2049 2018-08-11 10:06:24 IF you plug in current production (which I don't have a problem with), SG feeding equiv. (i do have a prblm with) and the current export pace you take EU #wheat C/O to 16MMT+. Weak export demand in EU & US right now has stocks rising.
2050 2018-08-11 10:03:55 I feel there are 1000s of small companies that are doing well in India but are not listed on the exchanges.

2064 2018-08-11 09:38:19 You might be surprised by how much a couple of years of rising food prices might focus people’s minds.  Look at the reversal of societal attitudes to food and farming in 2007/8. Rising stocks and falling prices since then have allayed those fears, but one bread riot in Egypt....

2068 2018-08-11 09:30:37 Based on MACD and RSI divergence + Rising wedge pattern I'm expecting a correction..

It's hard to say that the "top" is in, all I can say is that it must be close most (if not all of them) tech stocks are reaching all time highs over and over again..
2069 2018-08-11 09:30:26 Lammy should held accountable for his racism and blatant lies. There must be some form of recourse. Perhaps a turn in the stocks might help! 
2070 2018-08-11 09:26:25 Your reasoning for thinking this is?? Look at the logarithmic graph, BTC is a great investment still. Stick to your overvalued stocks and real estate, and you will be getting passed by crypto HODLers left and right.

2077 2018-08-11 09:18:47 They have the money. They spend it on things that have nothing to do with their workers. They hide it. They buy back stocks. They increase EXECUTIVE pay. It's important to pay attention to these things.

My other thoughts on gun control would take up too many characters
2138 2018-08-11 07:43:23 You can, but how often do you find a stock that multibags within days/ weeks? These stocks go up or down whether I trade them or not.

It's harder to trade these sort of stocks as they're illiquid and sometimes unreliable; majority of my trades are now breakouts/ trend breaks.

2163 2018-08-11 07:09:36 The average mutual fund turns over its portfolio at 100 percent or more a year. Let ’ s call it “ investing at warp speed,” admittedly an oxymoron, since churning stocks at such a pace can hardly be considered “investing.” - louis lowenstein

2179 2018-08-11 06:56:48 There are now 97 lithium stocks on the ASX (my own count). They are either producing or exploring (not simply holding tenaments). That is 4.75% of all stocks listed on ASX.  While some are 50% down, the quality ones generally aren't.  @globallithium

There will be a few winners & many losers in 2018 !!

Which stocks will rebound ?

Which will continue their downward trend or never mine ?

Be careful out there & don’t day dream nor always believe in cheerleaders or managements.

Because his team got completely outplayed? Sky probably aren’t going to make the playoffs, this was...#WNBA
2190 2018-08-11 06:36:46 Me tooooooo. Like seriously. Was it that serious that he had to yell in her face & disrespect her? Especially since he’s been known for keeping players in just like he got mad at Stocks for doing? THE HYPOCRISY!

2195 2018-08-11 06:29:48 The club & administration need a re-think of how the club is run & the current playing stocks. The AFL also need to take some ownership of a sinking ship & help stabilise the club, they need to recruit a few more senior experienced players in the off season also.
2196 2018-08-11 06:29:02 My issue was more with the way he was carrying on to her and the constant yelling. If Stocks had acted like he did she would’ve been reemed as an emotional woman I feel. I just don’t think it was nearly as big of a deal as he made it. The game was over. I get not wanting a play

2237 2018-08-11 05:17:56 my memory is not as it was, you will have to start using that phrase again, hopefully the AIM market will deliver a nice little bull run as we hit September so that you can. However carefully chosen there are stocks that are delivering and will deliver.

2251 2018-08-11 04:54:49 I reality, i think most ppl will take profit at 500 lol.  It's human emotion.  Rarely do ppl really hold stocks long term.  It's instinct.
2252 2018-08-11 04:54:35 I spent a lot of early days with penny stocks like most.  I feel like I’m watching a shell company impload all over again.
2253 2018-08-11 04:53:43 It’s based on people believing it’s worth something. I lost money on it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a bad deal. It means it’s just as questionable as stocks. Not all stocks rise some go down. Some are like roller coasters & go up just to come down & go back up again.

2265 2018-08-11 04:31:33 Maybe you're ok if you're trading $ORCL but I'm out (I was a long term investor until about 18 - 24 months ago); IMO there are better tech stocks for medium long term investing. But then, never say never!
2266 2018-08-11 04:30:52 Oh my gosh,How can you speak against darkmoney when you are rolling in it? It makes your decision for you and tells you how to vote, like theGlencore polynet copper mine.

2267 2018-08-11 04:29:08 It all depends on how you look at the Glass which is half full. Suggest to use “Replacement Cost” method to calculate real worth of OMC stocks. Not sure why market ignores clean balance sheets of OMCs but love Stocks like Manpasand, PC Jweller, Geetanjali. Vested interests.

2274 2018-08-11 04:19:49 We all know shit would've been different if Stocks was out there yelling at his ass. All y'all upset over her keeping her players out there... so what? I remember when the Sun were kicking my teams' ass and he still had his starters out there.

2277 2018-08-11 04:17:43 So for that we need a list of stocks that pass the trend template ( based on moving averages) .
2278 2018-08-11 04:17:41 Bayo you have to be at high % and Mario’s barely takes you anywhere u can see in the direct.

2279 2018-08-11 04:16:41 The analysts at CNBC Aawaz or other business news channels constantly give buy and sell calls through out the day.

I sometimes wonder if they themselves own those stocks? Or do they advise their own family members to buy or sell?
2280 2018-08-11 04:16:37 Unlike stocks where they can rig the supply by counterfeiting (naked shorting)  #Bitcoin and #Litecoin are immune to that. With adoption the PRICE will have to play catch up to improving fundamentals and true supply demand economics
2281 2018-08-11 04:16:16 Did you just make the argument for me?

2285 2018-08-11 04:10:59 Success on Wall Street is correlated with finding stocks/assets that are undervalued & buying. Or evaluating which assets in your portfolio are overvalued & selling. 

Recruiting is the same skill set.

The coaches you describe wouldn’t succeed on Wall Street either.
2286 2018-08-11 04:10:47 Yeah just if they somehow did and if it was 4 stocks. Right now since all them still kill early and taking out 1 of 3 stocks is too broken so I’m not supporting it
2287 2018-08-11 04:09:38 One can imagine the conversation: 
Putin: We need to bring back our asbestos exports.
45:  Done - I'll make sure it's a revision of the previous EPA ban. By the way, can I get stocks for the company? 
Putin: Sure, I'll arrange it. 
45: Don't let anyone know we talked about this.

2292 2018-08-11 04:04:42 Yeah probably not but if Final Smashes only killed over 70% it wouldn’t matter that much if it was 4 stocks and it charged slowly enough for 1 FS per game

2294 2018-08-11 04:03:36 That’s all you can say? I will not vote for Tina, her swampy ways are too much.She’s already In The top 1% in Personal wealth and is voting in senate on stocks she owns that will make her millions more. She would never debate and take questions on her issues. Unethical, no thanks
2295 2018-08-11 04:02:46 Same as mutual funds or stocks. Some just grow in value, some pay dividends which increase the amount of ETF you have (gets rolled back in). You have to sell it to get money back.
Yeah, I didn't have $3k to start, so used ETF to get me there, then rolled that into Vanguard
2296 2018-08-11 04:02:19 I don't think that will happen but if it does I'd like it. 3 stocks is good tho.
2297 2018-08-11 04:02:14 Congrats to all who followed my call on $ABN.v now over 100% in just 3 weeks and its the talk of the town all across the country.

2305 2018-08-11 03:52:46 Tina Smith needs to divest from her medical device stocks. Period. This is a grifter move.

Like you buying certain stocks for your 401k.
They are sold at Mass auctions in varying quantities.
You can buy them too if you go to Fed Treasury website.
2323 2018-08-11 03:31:18 I will offer this bit of experience, and it comes from a trader who was position limit in strangles in many takeover stocks at once in the late 80's, if you're concerned about being assigned at a retail level, you're taking too much risk or you're hedge is bad.  good luck

2331 2018-08-11 03:24:13 Looking through my options database lots of contracts sitting in open interest that expire next Friday in some top growth stocks. Moreover the 8/17 strike is the largest open interest contract by far in some really top growth stocks. This could be setting up for some huge trades.

2335 2018-08-11 03:21:00 Perhaps it would help if I understood why a private citizen would need a fully automatic firearm...Either way, since bump stocks (such as those used by the #MandalayBay shooter to kill 58 people & injure 500) can alter semis, I think stiffer regulation for them is indicated.

2344 2018-08-11 03:09:03 Curt Miller can be heard repeatedly shouting "bush league" at Amber Stocks as the Sky chase an all-time assists-per-game record. Sky end up tying the record; as Miller and Stocks pass by each other for post-game handshakes his displeasure is obvious.
2345 2018-08-11 03:07:36 Stocks had Chicago intentionally foul and then called timeout with the game in hand so they could go for an assist record.  Curt called it bush league and returned the favor fouling Sloot so mo record.
2346 2018-08-11 03:07:18 Hear me out here.Curt is going to have his team ready for the rematch sunday.don't be suprised if the Sun score 100.after that classless display there by Stocks calling a time out when you have the game in hand and tell your team to score.

2349 2018-08-11 03:05:45 I wanted to make sure I can diversify easily, and my options are expensive mutual funds, buy individual stocks that have trade cost per stock and high prices, or an ETF that is a bundle of specific stocks (index, tech, international), with a $5 minimum at the time
2350 2018-08-11 03:05:08 So u mean the same principles, indicators and the same TA and PA applies to Forex and Stocks like FB, Twitter, Intel, Gold, etc. So we can trade them as well.
2351 2018-08-11 03:04:48 Heated ending to tonight’s game between Connecticut Sun head coach Kurt Miller & Chicago Sky’s Amber Stocks. Miller calls Stocks out on her “bush league” plays towards the end of the game
2352 2018-08-11 03:04:40 you laugh now but when you get put in the stocks who’s gonna be laughing
2353 2018-08-11 03:04:29 An ETF is just a bundle of something you can invest in, like commodities or group of stocks, but you can buy them in smaller chunks. If I wanted to invest in Vanguard index mutual fund, it would have to be a $3000 minimum deposit, and you can buy/sell once a day.

2409 2018-08-11 02:13:12 Well, I guess they sufficiently push the descending voices underground! People will follow them, google, Facebook and Twitter are not the only platform! Told husband to get out of the social media stocks now.

2411 2018-08-11 02:12:41 Additionally, the "unit bias investment strategy" is imploding. Look at the "shares outstanding" of many alts. In all my years in junior mining stocks, I never saw cartoon-like share counts like these. If #BTC dominance returns to 2016 levels, I wouldn't be surprised.

2444 2018-08-11 01:48:04 Hey lost touch seniors, did you know the House GOP passed a bill cutting multi-billions of dollars from Social Security, Social Security Disability, Medicare and Medicaid at Trump's behest? Your either rich or demented in your old age. Stay in stocks esp. pharmaceuticals.

- security token (eventually don't see a reason for all stocks to not be issued on blockchain)

2459 2018-08-11 01:31:49 @elonmusk tweeted some stuff about stock buy backs for more than the stock trades for. It appears what he tweeted may not have been true thus  artificially driving up the price of stocks.

2470 2018-08-11 01:19:14 See 18 USC 208 and OGE regulations thereunder.  Diversified mutual funds are one option. There are other options but not individual stocks.  These are criminal statutes and apply to every other federal employee. Stupid? No -- ethics.

2474 2018-08-11 01:15:16 Love this comment. Our culture researches stocks and investment opportunities before making a decision to invest, but many times as Christian leaders we do not listen to the Holy Spirit about in whom we should invest our ‘most precious commodity’, time. Great conversation.

So Frey has no problem with this. Does he do it too? Does he stand to make money also.  Tina Smith needs to STEP DOWN
2486 2018-08-11 01:03:52 Why don’t we (those against censorship) just all abandon these platforms? Then their stocks can sink when only their declining liberal base is left.  I’ve already left FB for good, this is next. Time for a new platform soon!
2487 2018-08-11 01:03:32 I don't doubt that single-payer will turn the American "system" on its ear and will result in massive industry upheavals. Jobs will disappear and stocks will fall. But, isn't that when Americans are at their best? When markets change and open up to new ventures?

2493 2018-08-11 00:56:22 I'm very worried about the Russian cyber-hacking threat. What if they hacked into our central banks & created some huge sum, like $20 trillion? They could then bid up prices on bonds, stocks & real estate, creating massive wealth disparities that might lead to populism & unrest!

2499 2018-08-11 00:52:11 I hope your stocks go to 1 dollar or less. You are a bunch of high paid business men and women who don't care about anyone but your bottom line. Totally wrong. It sucks when Martin lies to us. Easy fix replace him now.

2507 2018-08-11 00:42:33 I do agree with the comment but I also have to be honest and say I that I do like the risk/reward now on certain MJ stocks and MU after the decline.
2508 2018-08-11 00:37:43 I went 2-2 in Rivals at smash con and got 65th overall. Not a bad considering last year I only took 2 stocks. I really should practice this game more. It’s a lot of fun.
2509 2018-08-11 00:37:06 Yes, obviously the SNB really wanted to stop the Swissy from appreciating too much. The question is how much money should they be allowed to print out of thin air to achieve their fx target? The next question is - having accumulated Dollars should they be buying US stocks?

2513 2018-08-11 00:35:03 $TSLA_355 lets not forget Telsa was one of the most shorted stocks way back when it was trading at $30. Then @elonmusk made few moves like paying gov. back and the stock didnt look back at shorts since then...
2514 2018-08-11 00:34:47 As I said, I trade the indexes, not individual stocks or sectors. Of course there's always a bull market somewhere, but that's not how I do things. While I'm 99% TA, it doesn't take a genius to see that QT has created huge headwinds and that's evident in the charts I look at.

2541 2018-08-11 00:09:44 I think two of the most important lessons I have learned from you is (1) not to chase stocks and (2) be greedy when others are fearful (and fearful when others are greedy).  Can never be reminded of this enough.  Thank you for the video and have a great weekend!

2545 2018-08-11 00:06:02 Government bonds and retirement accounts just don't grow GDP the same way stocks and new businesses do. Most people who received the 2008 stimulus package either put it in their savings or just spent it. Not exactly economy growing investments.
2546 2018-08-11 00:05:46 I THINK YOUTUBE VIDEOS IS THE NEW THING FOR UPDATES FOR STOCKS...

2548 2018-08-11 00:04:20 This is what Tina Smith does. She is using her senate seat to vote on her personal medical device stocks so they go up in value. She walks away richer! Super swampy,even Corrupt. Vote for Painter Minnesota Primary , AUGUST 14th!
2549 2018-08-11 00:02:39 Her second husband is a successful business man and investor. When you have millions of dollars & stocks are booming, you make money. Thanks to Bush& Trump tax cuts wealthy pay less. The rich are getting richer, income divide getting wider. Do you understand?

2625 2018-08-10 23:07:02 So, if the DOW doesn't have enough stocks in it for you, then use NYA, which includes all common stocks listed on the NYSE. That's over 2000 stocks. Oops...if you do that, then things look even worse because it's more than 6% lower than its Jan high, and only up 0.27% YTD.

2652 2018-08-10 22:41:23 Link I don't see any verification of that
2653 2018-08-10 22:41:11 And they should not be able to buy and sell stocks.
2654 2018-08-10 22:40:40 I know for a clear fact that the BBC promotes and stocks  the gaurdian as it's newspaper of choice. The editor is a regular advisor on internal policy at auntie. What does that say in relation to the bias they are accused of. These are circumstantial photos nothing more
2655 2018-08-10 22:40:14 Surprise, surprise, but the #MAGAt crowd will crow that roaring stock market = booming economy. And I bet less than 1/3 of them even have stocks or a 401k! #sad

2658 2018-08-10 22:39:16 @FunkySX DJ Stocks doing an awesome job tonight!
2659 2018-08-10 22:38:15 The only reliable CAPE signal is: when it’s high, global small/value stocks crush the S&P 500 by a mile. When CAPE is lower, they win by less.  

There’s a pretty simple investment policy message in those insights: diversify.
2660 2018-08-10 22:37:43 I dunno who will pump them more $$ though, they have already raised a ton, diluted the hell out of the stock, reverse split, lost customers, and basically lied to everyone.  Stock down 99.9%.  Yet some think they did DD and the company is going to explode!  HAHAHA
2661 2018-08-10 22:36:18 Best part of all, S&P 500 return since 1990 = +9.84%, it was +10.31% from 1926-1989!  The returns were identical despite CAPE ratios over 50% higher in second period!  There is almost ZERO out of sample info in CAPE, yet “stocks are overvalued” is taken as universal sign of doom
2662 2018-08-10 22:32:00 Anyone else addicted to the stock market? I often catch myself checking tickers, stock prices when the market is closed... and if I don’t have any positions #fb #twtr #snap #tsla #stocks
2663 2018-08-10 22:31:53 Actually war shark is holding long not short he just asked a simple question
2664 2018-08-10 22:30:28 *sheepish grin* We may have made some good profit on soup company stocks when we bought in way back when.
2665 2018-08-10 22:30:27 These are the 3 stocks in finance sector that yesterday set all-time highs:
$HIIQ, $NRIM, $EMCF
2666 2018-08-10 22:29:09 i trade stocks under her name too
2667 2018-08-10 22:28:56 Success on Wall Street is correlated with finding stocks/assets that are undervalued & buying. Or evaluating which assets in your portfolio are overvalued & selling. 

Recruiting is the same skill set.

The coaches you describe wouldn’t succeed on Wall Street either.
2668 2018-08-10 22:28:53 In that case they wont be around much longer unless someone pumps in real money real real soon

2671 2018-08-10 22:24:59 Still have time in between the vote. It is not certain yet that there will be one.
2672 2018-08-10 22:24:40 U.S. stocks closed lower Friday,08/10/18: $DJIA -0.77% at 25,313.14, $SPX -0.71% at 2,833.28, $COMPQ -0.67% at 7,839.11, $RUT -0.24% at 1686.80.

2674 2018-08-10 22:23:18 500% in a year. Heck yeah! This is one of many 500% gainers (real, Nasdaq stocks) that we've picked.

The past year, there were only THREE NYSE stocks that gained 500%... we picked one of those too... $KEM
2675 2018-08-10 22:23:13 True let’s see if that 200DMA holds under that probably risky
2676 2018-08-10 22:22:58 Stocks , pls!
2677 2018-08-10 22:21:16 Alberta natural gas producers struggle through worst prices in 26 years. This is why I'm picking away at some of the stocks because nobody wants them. Might see some short term pain but I think in a couple of years I am going to be laughing.
2678 2018-08-10 22:19:55 Doesn't Deutsche Bank have massive stocks of gold from...  er... never mind.
2679 2018-08-10 22:19:46 Yeah been good especially in the DAX, Bailed out of many stocks but principally long ECX and CM8....definetly a leaky ship on CM8. How about you?
2680 2018-08-10 22:19:16 RT young_pfy5811 "KDclouded Watching_Stocks Its freaking ridiculous. every 5 minutes the guy is posting about shorts on $HMNY.  We all know its hella dilution going on."
2681 2018-08-10 22:18:57 I hate bump stocks, its a waist of ammo, your first shot should always count
2682 2018-08-10 22:18:36 Josh should trap across overwatch stocks ??   
2683 2018-08-10 22:17:13 I thought it wasn’t illegal for Congress or their  staffers to trade stocks on inside info per Obama ruling? Why this guy when they are all doing it?
2684 2018-08-10 22:16:13 Yeah, but $HMNY now basically is a new gym charging people a membership fee, then NEVER OPENING!  I paid for a year of Movie Pass and cannot use it now.  Literally every movie is blacked out, once in a while I can see one at 10PM and that is all.  Its #FRAUD.
2685 2018-08-10 22:13:56 I’m kinda new to the market, if was indeed working for $HMNY, would that be legal?
2686 2018-08-10 22:13:41 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
2687 2018-08-10 22:13:26 Qapples took 7 stocks in our crew battle lol but we still lost because Take and I are poop and only took 2 a piece.
2688 2018-08-10 22:13:17 And in Europe they make the cars to consume more fule than necessary because they probably own lot of stocks in the oil companies, plus they have a deal with governments that take huge taxes on the fuel!
2689 2018-08-10 22:11:43 They are doing it as we speak. Why else are the Shareholders dumping their stocks!
2690 2018-08-10 22:11:04 HMNY Certainly not allowing people to see 3 movies a month is a fraud , but alot of subscriptions services account for people not using it. Imagine if everyone at your local gym who signed up showed up 5x a week , it wouldn't work !!! You'd wait a day for a machine
2691 2018-08-10 22:10:44 Its freaking ridiculous. every 5 minutes the guy is posting about shorts on $HMNY.  We all know its hella dilution going on.
2692 2018-08-10 22:10:11 Have they been dumping $FCU, $VMY, ... I notice a bunch of uranium stocks that have been declining while the spot price has been increasing.
2693 2018-08-10 22:09:19 RT young_pfy5811 "Watching_Stocks Do you work for $HMNY? You never post anything else."
2694 2018-08-10 22:08:57 Seems to be I suppose. He was one of my followers. I made a post asking him what this is all about (pic below), and he blocked me.
2695 2018-08-10 22:08:51 Go to Stocks equal the best dogs. No p00 to pick up.
2696 2018-08-10 22:08:44 Just a thought, could Trump be purposely placing these tariffs out to affect the market where by he and others make a profit selling off affected stocks?
2697 2018-08-10 22:08:33 7th in dubs. I missed noticing a few things that cost stocks, and fox is hard to keep up with in general ;-;

Let's hope I do better in singles!
2698 2018-08-10 22:08:24 I would prefer to buy Ripple stocks if possible, XRP not sure! I think there are projects with a more positiv vision! But if u go for short term profit only, XRP could be good, dunno!
2699 2018-08-10 22:07:48 Today we closed our position in $WU at a 5% loss and went long $RESI.  Missed the huge move yesterday, but hoping to capture some significant continuation movement. #Trending #trendfollowing #trading #Investing #stocks
2700 2018-08-10 22:07:48 No Turdeau was being deliberately facetious because Modi snubbed him, you really should educate yourself on world affairs. And what exactly has Trump "sold out" to Putin? I guess properly funding NATO and crashing Russian energy stocks was Putin's genius plan all along.
2701 2018-08-10 22:06:54 Yesterday Allie was like "hey what you doing tomorrow night, wanna see Pink?" man this woman likes to randomly pull out concert tickets like she stocks a box of em #ithinkifoundmysugarmami
2702 2018-08-10 22:06:23 Maybe, I mean I don’t have a job atm so... I have a lot of money saved up tho. I earn about 1000kr-4000kr just in stocks/funds per year cx
2703 2018-08-10 22:05:16 You seem to be worried about the wrong things! I think you need to focus on the lies that you and your scammer buddies are trying to spread around to confuse people.  #TheTruth and the law are closing in on the scamming bears fast!

2705 2018-08-10 22:01:25 The #richers borrow money to spend on the military, they invest in mil/industry stocks, and hire a big time tax account to avoid taxes, so the middle class tax payer is giving welfare to the 1%.
2706 2018-08-10 21:59:52 Do you work for $HMNY? You never post anything else.
2707 2018-08-10 21:58:56 sure but i would not blindly leave that trade site there. these stable tech stocks can swing like no other.
2708 2018-08-10 21:58:54 The sad part is if literally EVERYONE with Movie Pass decided to USE it, they would go flat broke.  They only survive now because they limited the service to much that nobody can actually see a movie, hence no $ to pay for a ticket!!  They are losing customers daily.  #FRAUD
2709 2018-08-10 21:58:31 Who sold the Africans into slavery? Dare you to answer
2710 2018-08-10 21:57:15 Stocks never go down
2711 2018-08-10 21:56:46 Aye, you need to link up with @msmariasimone. She's trying to learn more about stocks.
2712 2018-08-10 21:56:44 So like what if we make a new event for #SmashBrosUltimate separate from regular singles:

- SquadStrike 3v3 (3 stocks, each stock is a different character)

- Stage Morph On (Each Player banns 1 than picks 1)

- Final Smash Meter ON
2713 2018-08-10 21:56:38 #MoviePass just announced that they are making a new movie with one of their subsidiary companies. $HMNY HAS MONEY AND MONEY BACKERS, ON TOP OF #INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE WHICH ALL HAVE A LOT OF VALUE AND EARNING POTENTIAL.

 NEW MOVIE = NOT BANKRUPT
2714 2018-08-10 21:52:10 Then teach them the difference between patriots and presidents who stocks his administration full of Muslim Brotherhood members.
2715 2018-08-10 21:51:40 Hmm; I wonder why! That's more @POTUS affe ting the markets to put money in his pockets! How many of these stocks does Donnie or his "Friends" own?
2716 2018-08-10 21:51:22 To be fair, he would have to sell his stock to personally fund it, dropping its value in the process. His wealth like many others is counted in his stocks value.
2717 2018-08-10 21:51:08 Did you sell your 401K and reap the profits or are those paper gains? You’ve neither made nor lost money until you cash in the stocks.
2718 2018-08-10 21:49:59 Gonna be real with you.  You start name calling you hurt your cause and the cause of people who short TSLA and stocks in general.  It’s not a contest man.  Keep it to fundies.

2722 2018-08-10 21:46:37 I was thinking about a put option on them, seeing how their stock is declining. Basically, shorting their stock. They (the FAANG Stocks) aren't the market darlings they once were.
2723 2018-08-10 21:46:09 If the right has such a obsession with making abortion illegal, why not go after sex before marriage. Incarcerate men who get women pregnant before marriage! BOOM! Problem solved! Buy condom stocks cos condoms will be more popular than sliced bread!

2732 2018-08-10 21:41:31 Near midday, Mortgage Bond prices holding gains. Stocks lower on negative geopolitical headlines.10-yr yield 2.87%.
2733 2018-08-10 21:41:22 Mortgage Bonds able to crank out solid gains as risk off is the trade of the day. However, Stocks are off their worst levels.
2734 2018-08-10 21:41:07 Stocks lower soon after the opening bell as the drama in Turkey weighs on the U.S. equity markets. Dow -180 points.
2735 2018-08-10 21:40:55 It can go anywhere, people get crazy in panic’s.  Stocks get mis priced all the time, that’s where the money is made.  Buying them when they’re ridiculously cheap!

2753 2018-08-10 21:32:38 Could not agree more. BRK is a kind of low beta index fund with the lowest management fees imaginable. But I personally am in a very small fund run by a value manager. Mostly very small un-followed stocks where an information edge is still possible.
2754 2018-08-10 21:32:25 Hahahahaha, no backing out now!
2755 2018-08-10 21:31:40 YOU MIGHT NOT SURVIVE

2757 2018-08-10 21:30:16 $TWTR ;-) i like how it this company is positioned in the social media space. 14-30s was a easy call but now the game is changed and , for me , harder to see but i like the general direction
2758 2018-08-10 21:29:21 Yes true, I believe the full @MarketSmith app has that option, I recommend Top Stocks app to new traders because of the price point and they get a nice introduction to the @MarketSmith line of products it’s nice for traders that work full time and may be traveling..

2766 2018-08-10 21:24:23 Lastly remember getting tips off social media is dangerous. People talking their own book, buying falling knife stocks etc. Don't construct a portfolio from Twitter, you won't last 5 minutes. Buy stocks that are going up with solid trends. Never buy below 200-day moving average.

2773 2018-08-10 21:19:37 I'm not saying you will never see a PW again. But if you diversify 20+ stocks, cut your losers at say 20-25%. You may start to see results. Having said this its a tough mkt out there atm, easy to get discouraged if you never seen the same before.
2774 2018-08-10 21:19:32 'tis great to have my thoughts substantiated by a more seasoned trader as yourself. The only breakout calls are made by "the urgers" pumping stocks they bought off the base. Respect @LINEWIPER

2826 2018-08-10 20:54:10 That’s great work; 43% is a big number.  ETF market maker hedging is all done algorithmically, and with fewer and fewer individuals buying individual stocks and assets moving from MF’s to passive ETF’s, I think this trend continues.

2843 2018-08-10 20:36:21 I'd argue that because stocks and bonds are a concept, rather than a product, the comparison doesn't hold up.

Distributing risk, allocating ownership, and deploying capital aren't what's being disrupted. It's the underlying infrastructure.
2844 2018-08-10 20:36:16 Consider your horizon: do you need the 9% income now or in 20 years? Don’t mix a defensive investment stategy (DGI) with investing in high yield (and maybe riskier) stocks/REITs. Be honest and careful.

2855 2018-08-10 20:26:01 Recently got into uranium stocks. Bought $UUUU and $UEC. As global production decreases and companies refusing to sell at a loss, demand should increase heavily on spot market. Might be a multi year hold. IMO great R/R on longer timeframes.
2856 2018-08-10 20:25:08 They fail to state that 90% of these complaints come from people that bought in and lost money due to #crypto prices falling.  Imagine if everyone who ever lost money in business investments or stocks could get media attention.

2906 2018-08-10 19:53:14 What I love about stocks like $SIGL is that they are more predictable. Company wakes up and the stock pps goes up. It's that simple. A company that is already active will have news just for the sole purpose of selling shares. Unpredictable. PPS goes down.

2910 2018-08-10 19:51:46  Hello, is this the literally one store on this continent that actually stocks my partner’s size and we literally have to save up all year to get a couple?

It is? Good!

Would you happen to have Prime shipping?
2911 2018-08-10 19:51:39 @cvpayne See what I said about bank stocks for this year? Today showed quite a lot of vulnerability.
2912 2018-08-10 19:51:35 What do you think of this: I split my div stks into REITS/MLPs yielding 9% w/ 3% annual growth and DGI stocks yielding 2-3% w/ 12% annual growth. Provides hi income while still exposed to cap appreciation. Thoughts? Thx

2914 2018-08-10 19:51:29 LOL SMH dude.. they come in every day! CHECK MY POSTS 

I have made more than two dozen tweets about new institutional ownership filings in the last few weeks.

2915 2018-08-10 19:51:18 Take a look at what he is spending tax dollars on of late. It sure isn't being spent on protecting our salmon stocks or wildlife.
2916 2018-08-10 19:49:27 Now the underpriced homebuilder stocks from your 7/25 tweet makes more sense.  I know in my town, houses that typically sold at asking within a couple of weeks have been sitting since April.
2917 2018-08-10 19:49:04 Oui, sans aucune hésitation, mais fais gaffe pour les galettes saucisse, je viens de faire un trou dans les stocks ;-)

2919 2018-08-10 19:48:49 Regardless if its stocks or crypto, $btc or $awx; good market analysis can contribute to success, but being a good trader is not synonymous with being a good market analyst.

2921 2018-08-10 19:47:47 Some thought stocks were cheap but others took advantage of the liquidity to get out. Still, for real trouble $SPX must drop below 2800. Bargain hunters will put a fight. :)
2922 2018-08-10 19:47:32 Lol. Yeah our stocks went through the roof with the Iranian deal and raising the debt ceiling and then claiming victory while he keeps it under his own ceiling that he raised. Libs - are you that ignorant?

2926 2018-08-10 19:43:25 Exception being wall street scamming investors and IRAs again today and for the last 4 quarters.

2928 2018-08-10 19:40:31 Really?Amy is walking the thin line of supporting a appointed sitting senator,Tina Smith, in her corrupt medical device stocks. Tina will personally make millions by voting to enrich herself on the stocks. Why is that ok with Amy? Why does she support this swampy behavior by Tina
2929 2018-08-10 19:40:05 Now their stocks tank and everybody revolts against unelected giant tech making illegal decisions about what private citizens can subject themselves to.
2930 2018-08-10 19:39:39 Trader's Tip #1 Swing traders hold stocks anywhere from a few days to a few months, depending on trading strategies & market conditions.  While there are many different trading strategies, most seek to identify & capture a trending stock’s “sweet spot” or the bulk of the trend.

2935 2018-08-10 19:35:14 @amyklobuchar  Amy, you are not indestructible. If you are agreeing with Tina Smith being able to vote on her personal medical device stocks, making millions off her senate seat. You are guilty also. Ask her publicly to sell them! Why do you walk the line of corruption for her?

2956 2018-08-10 19:22:30 The tories do not want social or affordable housing. Why? Probably because there are for the working class on low pay, min wage, disabled, single parents all of whom probably because they vote labour and have no cash to invest in stocks, shares and Tory profit conning companies.

2983 2018-08-10 19:07:39 @sahneydeepak Sir every correction in Index,BN & Stocks will be brought into, liquidity is huge. Mutuals don't know what to do with the money that is pouring in. Your view pls
2984 2018-08-10 19:07:25 Again, the key is “well-regulated”. Bump stocks bypass the “no automatic weapons” law. AR-15s in the hands of civilians isn’t really “well-regulated” but I do see the argument that they’re not actually much different from another kind of gun in terms of deadliness.

2991 2018-08-10 19:05:26 Thanks for ur guidance AmitJi. Just was applied the rules based on HAVELLS screenshot & RELIANCE screenshot in Quora. Hope you have already explained about it in ur Unofficed portal. If possible please share that link, will try to understand ur methodology to select such stocks..
2992 2018-08-10 19:04:58 Oof my stocks
2993 2018-08-10 19:04:48 No, it really isn’t. I think at licensed shooting ranges that AR-15s are okay, because that’s a controlled situation, but that’s the only time. Weapons designed after military weapons shouldn’t be in the hands of the public. Bump stocks shouldn’t either.
2994 2018-08-10 19:04:14 We do our "work." Then we let stocks do their "work."  #stocks

2996 2018-08-10 19:03:42 Buy stocks, such as the Big 5 banks (RY, TD, BNS, BMO, CM), BCE or Rogers (RCI.A); or ETFs (FIE, XUS and so on). Because the management fee of mutual funds are very experience in Canada.

3020 2018-08-10 18:47:26 "You don’t need to be a CFA to look at the financials and see that Tesla is effectively insolvent."

This, 100%. I am just some guy who happened to follow a few popular stocks a couple years back. The idea that professionals are invested in this company is beyond baffling.
3021 2018-08-10 18:47:21 Ok. Charges for reviewing stocks?

@HiHonorIndia Bring more and more stocks so that some customers can buy

3027 2018-08-10 18:43:06 Now imtv should do buyback shares.  The more confident they can make shareholders the better the business for them.  Foucs on the business yet realize the shareholders can bring more income if they can get more than 4 thousand to invest in stocks.

3040 2018-08-10 18:39:30 He's a rubbish constituency MP. He lied about the viability of the new benefits regime causing suffering and in some cases death. He is a total wide boy of the right. Yes. Prison too good for him. Stocks better
3041 2018-08-10 18:39:29 I agree BUT I am wondering what the sources of profits will be and if the pile in might make stocks function more like bonds.
3042 2018-08-10 18:39:19 USD bias is bullish for stocks? bonds? real estate? sp500? nasdaq? russell?
I think a weaker USD is better for these things. Definitely a tug of war today with the USD spike, but the bears are winning. Maybe you mean longer term?
3043 2018-08-10 18:38:58 Your philosophy of simplification - one camera, one lens, sticking to certain film stocks - is something I've been trying to strive towards lately, but at the moment I have too many favourite films to choose from!
3044 2018-08-10 18:38:47 1/ The familiare MMT sectoral-balances version of stock-flow consistent, while useful, isn't consistent with, doesn't explain or balance to, bottom-line balance-sheet stocks: total assets and net worth.

Because: doesn't include real assets (stock), or holding gains (flow).
3045 2018-08-10 18:38:21 Yeah I'm gonna need to learn how to trade these stocks/sell houses/get a business rolling/ or get streaming so I can afford to travel  I want to live this life always
3046 2018-08-10 18:38:12 I look for stocks with recent news / articles on Seeking Alpha with zero comments.
3047 2018-08-10 18:37:59 Competitive Smash 64 tournament matches are traditionally played with five stocks, Melee with four stocks, Brawl with three, and Smash 4 with two stocks. Therefore logically, Smash Ultimate tournaments shall be played with just one stock. It only makes sense! 
3048 2018-08-10 18:37:44 Can't be bearish US stocks until profits peak.
3049 2018-08-10 18:37:03 Yea stocks is only good for when your older in my option unless you know which ones are going to no fail in the long run
3050 2018-08-10 18:36:56 Just enough to get more pile in to dividend stocks in the midst of a currency crisis and thus creating incentives for more leverage. Fun times. A 1998 response except to equities instead of UST.
3051 2018-08-10 18:36:02 And I hate stocks I find them boring lmao, so that’s why I rely on krypto a lot
3052 2018-08-10 18:35:40 Nigeria’s stocks entered a bear market as worsening political tensions and an emerging-market sell-off caused foreign investors to shun assets in Africa’s biggest oil producer.
3053 2018-08-10 18:35:35 Shouldn’t the government at least get shares/stocks in those companies?
3054 2018-08-10 18:34:35 Ah oui, non! Quand je renouvelle les stocks pour les vacances j’achète pour réutiliser aussi après. Je ne suis pas Mariah Carey (et je n’ai pas son compte en banque)

3097 2018-08-10 18:07:20 Instead of the buybacks could they do something where they bought stocks for the employees and put it in their 401k or gave as a bonus but you had to wait say 5 years to access it? Therefore helping employees and getting the stock sorta off the market. Just brainstorming.

3119 2018-08-10 17:54:44 $SPY $QQQ $AMZN $KEM -- stocks are weakening into the close, which makes sense. Lots of cross currents, and not much out there in the way of positive catalysts.

3136 2018-08-10 17:43:28 The best time to buy stocks is when it down so you might be able to make best profit. If you wait until its peak to buy, you’ll always lost it. So does someone’s life, there are good time & bad time for you to step in.

3145 2018-08-10 17:41:02 A couple things re. SX8 from a technical point of view: 
1) Daily stocks turned bearish following the peak of $9.22 1/4 on 7/31
2) Meaning the contract now looks to be in a minor (short-term) 3-wave downtrend. 
3) Fri sell-off looks to be part of Wave C (third wave)...(cont.)

3151 2018-08-10 17:39:29 The reason why the #Russell $IWM has become so important is because it shows rotation of capital...away from tariff afflicted LG cap stocks to higher risk. Meaning investors still want to be invested, even with more risk. Once that falls, markets will see a 10%-15% correction
3152 2018-08-10 17:39:06 Charlie,  there is no enforcement. As you watch stocks understand the SEC won't do a thing about quote stuffing, flash trading, packet churning, layering, sub-pennying, liquidity, latency and dark pool arbitrage, NBBO and Reg NMS exemptions, "hide-not-sliding" or collocation.
3153 2018-08-10 17:38:18 @Abhishekkar_  Hi sir I have one question for you. Usually I trade with stocks directly and not stock futures . Is there a difference in brokerage for same. For example I short 10k to 20k shares of Tata steel with zerodha. So if I use futures10-20 lot assuming 1000 stock per lot.

3167 2018-08-10 17:30:03 I think comparing super meter in smash to super meter in standard fighters is pretty wild. So many differences.

- rounds vs stocks

- all relatively similar dmg vs random dmg/properties
- etc.

Either way, I WANT US TO TRY IT.
3168 2018-08-10 17:29:13 The stock benefits were nice when there was a potential for the stock to split by 5 or even 10, granting employees more stocks per share, but now that is very unlikely to happen. Actually buying stock is hard because of the low amount most people make.

Unless you are a big corp , you don’t see much.The big corps invested that money back into buying their own stocks which in turn made stock prices rocket and increased the value of their shares and company. Why the hell do you think the stock market is rising?

3410 2018-08-10 15:51:04 Turkish stocks already had enough, esp. banks down 40-60% over last 6-12 months. Their valuations (PE 2.5-4) certainly express systemic risks, but contagion story unlikely.

3426 2018-08-10 15:43:18 No. Clearly the bear market stemmed from the broader tech collapse. I'm saying that investors shouldn't just cavalierly ignore Turkey because its problems are part of a broader EM crisis, one that may very well impact U.S. stocks as we've seen in the past.

3566 2018-08-10 14:36:04 That's the very real danger that 401(k)s pose (unlike traditional pensions): all the investment risk is on the retiree. No easy answers. Still, I'd think that at 85 stocks would be minimal allocation. And the best annuity around - Social Security - would also provide support.

3574 2018-08-10 14:32:44 People seeing returns of stocks after the fact is a big problem. Over a long time horizon it's easy to rationalise a 90% drawdown. If you wake up and a stock is down 90% (ruining your PnL), few people can be objective about it.

3585 2018-08-10 14:28:12 I would agree with this. I never understood how people had any confidence in picking sectors or a cheap index. Of course, it's also really hard with stocks, but at least you have a shot with small underfollowed stocks or factor-based approaches.
3586 2018-08-10 14:27:58 If you have a lot of in, I think you should sell. The management has crashed 3 other penny stocks to the ground and they are so diluted that they have more incentive to keep issuing stock than consider an acquisition. Read all the excellent articles by @SeekingAlpha on this.

3597 2018-08-10 14:22:36 Agreed but the pattern continues so long as the tick data suggests repetition:  As one HFT described to me -- buying stocks that are 5s that the model says will become 6s, shorting 5s becoming 4s, netting at day's end. Our models say this is 43% of Russell 1000 volume currently.
3598 2018-08-10 14:22:36 $HMNY Bears  Love  to “PUMP” the stock price DOWN with LIES & blame it on everything or anyone they can target as not helping them spread lies. (including me) They’re just helping me spread #TheTruth to everyone they have been telling lies to about #MoviePass, Mitch, & Ted.

3714 2018-08-10 13:46:40 A very important observation indeed. My point is that notwithstanding those small exposures, current pressure on bank stocks is not differentiating on the magnitude of exposure.

3724 2018-08-10 13:42:14 Short covering in India is a myth as you can’t short stocks overnight  unlike US or other places. In actual short covering people buy back the stock, hence the rally. In India, futures just follow the cash where the contracts can be exited without impacting the stock price.

If they aren't owned by the government, they can choose who to do business with. That's capitalism.

3883 2018-08-10 12:32:50 The guy who killed 58 in Vegas and wounded he hundreds wasn’t a criminal until he pulled the trigger. He sure had easy access to bump stocks, high capacity mags and military style weapons. Maybe if he couldn’t buy those things more would have lived.

3886 2018-08-10 12:30:50 As I'm sure you know, US stocks ignored SE Asia/Russia crisis for months in 97/98. It didn't matter - until it did. Then the Dow tanked 20% in weeks. Of course, Greenspan introduced the markets to the "Fed Put" shortly thereafter. But maybe we should pay a BIT of attention?

3890 2018-08-10 12:28:21 Twitter is becoming so liberal, monolithic, anti-conservative,they stifle and bully conservatives. That's why their stocks keeps plummeting.

3894 2018-08-10 12:27:10 I don't think the issue is "just Turkey," at least not to me. Multiple EM countries have seen their bonds, currencies, and stocks fall - some more sharply than others - as a result of Fed hikes, massive borrowing in USD from the easy money days coming back to haunt them, etc.
3895 2018-08-10 12:27:02 I follow great swing traders on Twitter - though I am fundamental long term investor - because they can identify set ups in names I own or plan to own. They also flag stocks I know nothing about like $OSTK. I stick to my names but appreciate receiving all ideas.
3896 2018-08-10 12:21:44 Basically, I don't think any public official should hold stocks in companies for which they either (a) might get some inside info on or (b) might have a vote on something related to a policy effecting that company or (c) supposed to be representing voter interest vs that group.

3924 2018-08-10 12:02:41 Some journalist can provide great insights on very niche industries or topics. The problem is that they then feel like they can accurately opine on the stocks in that industry, despite not understanding finance or accounting. $FWONK is a great example of this

4309 2018-08-10 06:27:03 My Investment style: 
1 - Buying stocks of great cash rich Companies during a panic sell (Facebook scandal for example, UPS sell off earlier this year)

4317 2018-08-10 06:17:43 So Quora is your best source?  Anyway, 25% is not 40%.  It is actually about 40% shy of 40%.  Also, the Dow is not the entire stock market.  It is 30 of the largest stocks.  You might call them the blue chip stocks.

4365 2018-08-10 05:32:27 this discussion has always been interesting to me. because people look at our stocks as independent lives. Ive always seen them as part of our health bar. Essentially one stock is a 1/3rd of our health and percent is just red life until that stock is actually taken.
4366 2018-08-10 05:32:10 Yet bump stocks are still legal...
4367 2018-08-10 05:30:27 I think metered Final Smashes would make a lot of sense if we tried a 4 stock format. With 4 stocks, the ability to insta-kill (even then the metered ones are weaker) a single stock wouldn't be as impactful as it'd only take out 1/4 of your "match".

4587 2018-08-10 02:30:59 A lot of action is expected in power stocks, especially those with stressed assets (Tata Power, for one). 

PSU power distributors and financiers will benefit too, along with banks.

4590 2018-08-10 02:27:45 Sounds like flows accumulating to stocks 
4591 2018-08-10 02:27:20 My point is they spend enough money. During Madoff yes that was a issue but no longer.  Asset allocation is the problem. Pick the wrong stocks you're going to lose money. Pick the wrong players you're going to lose games. Very simple concept asshole.
4592 2018-08-10 02:27:07 Yeah, I might invest in a few low-risk stocks, but I dunno if I definitely don’t want anything to do with the higher risk ones
4593 2018-08-10 02:26:55 I agree with you. I don’t think we can sustain above 90 with current stock situation. US stocks to use has not changed much over the past few years. We will need a tighter balance sheet to sustain higher prices long term.
4594 2018-08-10 02:26:49 After reading a few very interesting posts online, it's very possible for the Helios and Matheson analytics company, which is a (to my knowledge) subscription based service for MoviePass. Good news is that there may be hope for the stock after all. #stocks

4645 2018-08-10 02:00:40 I am prone to be skeptical of story stocks like this, but fortunately experience led me to ignore it during the concept years.

4646 2018-08-10 01:59:35 There are already “forces” that take care of that stuff. This is just more to bloat the defense budget/stocks.

4679 2018-08-10 01:27:40 The Vegas shooting. Paddock in a bizarre scene with over a dozen semi-rifles all with bumpski stocks. Paddock owned several properties bordering Bohemian Grove in No. Cal.  Paddock's brother soon arrested on pedophile charges.  Many witnesses reported multiple shooters.
4680 2018-08-10 01:27:19 Yeah listen to the Fiancial review and only buy bank stocks and property in Sydney, both ethical and sound investment neither of which is in a giant bubble.
4681 2018-08-10 01:26:58 GOP Rep Chris Collins received *insider info*about “A multiple sclerosis drug the Australian firm had been developing failed a clinical test.” He was on the board of directors of comp. His family sold off their stocks avoiding $700K+ in losses 4 days prior 2 the public knowing.

4685 2018-08-10 01:24:54 Overreach by social media/search firms is likely to lead to devastating blowback imo, incl unwanted regulatory impacts, breakups & even potential executiveorders by @realDonaldTrump 

likely the worst performing stocks of next 4/5 yrs will be large cap social media/search names
4686 2018-08-10 01:24:45 With buyback, gov gets less this year. 

(Oh BTW I realized recently: for very wealthy -- ignoring shelters, offshore... -- the estate tax is paid on the full value of marked-to-market estate including stocks. Much higher than cap gains rate.
4687 2018-08-10 01:24:35 How about banning holding individual stocks if not in a blind trust?

4691 2018-08-10 01:23:56 Ah yes, the old 'no one wants the stocks? Well then let's all buy the currency' trade.
More plausible indeed.
4692 2018-08-10 01:23:50 So, I just remembered this actually. 
Yesterday, I accomplished 2 years of trading. I started on August 8, 2016. I still remember my first option trade. 
A small $1 wide short call spread in $SPY lol!

4693 2018-08-10 01:22:41 that's what i was implying & you're right. that's why stocks soared after the the report came out, consumers are spending more than what the gov projects they make based on tax data, which means more borrowing & BOOM! drizzlin dat sweet sweet debt #TurnUp

4697 2018-08-10 01:18:46 Publicly traded companies just means you can buy stocks if anything they tend to be more directly focused on profits via agrigated direction.
Private traded is more limited in scope normally owned by a family or controled group they can have an agenda
4698 2018-08-10 01:17:42 I’m a little confused on this one. They print francs, buy US stocks, but that devalues their own currency. Is this a way to both devalue and accumulate assets at the same time? My financial understanding is a little worse than I thought. Am I missing something?

4708 2018-08-10 01:05:49 Everyone is so anxious for a correction ... That even a small correction is been bought ... in the cycle of stock market investing are we at still at the #optimism #enthusiasm phase or this is more #exubarance #Euphoria phase .... Speaking purely of #Nifty and #nifty50 stocks
4709 2018-08-10 01:05:02 Ruble down 5 pct today, Russian stocks down 9 pct.  Damn, that Trump is Putin's puppet, sure enough.  Plain as day.  Treason stalks the land.

4712 2018-08-10 01:04:17 How many don’t own stocks?
4713 2018-08-10 01:03:19 Income was defined as a salary or hourly wage...when they added in total income (dividends, stocks, bonuses) the top 1% went to $340 million/year "income"....which was the exact same people every year...which shows there is a cohesive static group "hording" total income
4714 2018-08-10 01:02:49 If you think people should own stocks and bonds and hold forever, why do they need you? Your argument against Gold is using super LT time frames. People can just buy TLT and SPY and dollar cost average.
4715 2018-08-10 00:59:57 *stocks, sorry lol
4716 2018-08-10 00:59:47 I agree. Always better opps in stocks than in indexes. Not sure what he meant by that, but I don’t know his time frame, so... 
4717 2018-08-10 00:59:46 >Invest in stocks 
>Buy the newest Jordans 

Choose one
4718 2018-08-10 00:59:00 They shouldn’t even be trading or investing in individual stocks. Mutual funds and your portfolio handled by an investment company or nothing while you serve in Congress. For them and immediate family.
4719 2018-08-10 00:58:43 Raise taxes on the working class. Gas tax, sales tax, VAT. These taxes hit the poor and the middle-class, while the wealthy buy bonds and stocks and don't pay these taxes.

Great plan.
4720 2018-08-10 00:58:32 This line of thinking: Selling stocks/bonds in 401k to fund your Real-estate investment isn't a problem, because you're simply switching from one asset class to another.
Like $ Managers arguing debt accumulation by auto-enrollment not a problem: it's funding assets like house/car
4721 2018-08-10 00:56:13 We only know about how rage is in Smash 4. I haven't seen anyone complain about rage in Ultimate. (played with 3 stocks)
4722 2018-08-10 00:56:07 Why can’t you keep your promise of banning bump stocks?? You PROMISED!! Your obsessions are unbelievable!! Your favoritism is disgusting! Your language should not be used so the children in our country hear you. Shame on you! I doubt you EVER read responses to your tweets!!
4723 2018-08-10 00:55:46 This is just a scam to send our tax dollars to defense contractors. Better load up on Boeing and Lockheed Martin stocks now 
4724 2018-08-10 00:55:18 “A portfolio of stocks mimicking the stocks purchased by Democratic House members outperformed the market by 9 percent. The Republican portfolio by just 2 percent.”John Carney| @carney
4725 2018-08-10 00:55:03 Is this a function of long-term investors putting money in broadly-based etf's rather than individual stocks? Much less Trading. More money just dumped into indexes and sectors?
4726 2018-08-10 00:54:11 i dont think they ever showed it? they just said it's one battle, elimination style. so it should be 3 stocks for 3 characters, one each.
4727 2018-08-10 00:52:37 I’ve been intentional about increasing my financial literacy... some days it’s fun. Some days I end up with a headache lol. Today, I finally made a decision on the set of stocks I want to buy and hold. 
4728 2018-08-10 00:52:01 just came back from the fattest comeback of my life. my boy Senk does a sick Dunk combo on me on my first stock and i had to bring it back with 1 stock left on his fresh 2 stocks

i turned it up and did like a 26 -> 70 coast to coast combo on Lylat since Can was on a platform

4733 2018-08-10 00:49:04 Not something I give one shit about, cost only matters when I am trying to get said game, whatever it is. If I want to "invest" in something with that other notion in mind, I'll do it with stocks, gold, etc. Not old games. Same line I've said for so long but there it is.
4734 2018-08-10 00:46:31 There will always be volitity in the markets. Definitely not what it was in the past. Stocks and forex are less volitile than crypto doesn't mean people are still making a living.
4735 2018-08-10 00:46:10 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your phantom limb syndrome
4736 2018-08-10 00:45:59 What a fabulous investing crew, thank you for your ideas, what you are personally doing for successful investing, and above all your honesty. I check many of your mentioned stocks, and ideas. Thanks again for sharing your talents.

4737 2018-08-10 00:45:49 More stocks more count
4738 2018-08-10 00:43:48 Being brave is staying with stocks when storm clouds loom and not buying a fear-based asset that’s barely beat inflation since 1975. And valuations on stocks, especially looking beyond the S&P 500, are not at all time highs.  That much is certain
4739 2018-08-10 00:43:06 I learned to read from the funnies in a newspaper, I learned to Think from a newspaper. I learned to debate from editorials.  I fear my grandchildren won’t. Another shame on the current administration. Private vendetta of the Twitter fan. I guess we know what stocks he shorted!
4740 2018-08-10 00:43:01 It's a great indicator to me that stocks gonna go bye bye soon
4741 2018-08-10 00:40:48 Friends don't even want to talk about traditional stocks. They just want good job and mortgage. I guess they are just not ready.
4742 2018-08-10 00:40:34 Maybe 3 Stock 7 minutes, but definitely 3 stocks
4743 2018-08-10 00:40:28 You don't have any money invested in this company (short or long), so it is hard for you to understand what I am trying to convey to you. Stocks trading is like operating a business where time is money. Your arguments all end the same negative way with self-centered ego tripping

4746 2018-08-10 00:37:52 LooOOOooL :p
4747 2018-08-10 00:37:42 You're right about most of that @jjhorgan . But I'm not convinced you believe what you're saying. Get active with the bands protesting the open net salmon farms to removed the threat to our wild stocks..then I might believe what you say about respecting their contributions to us.
4748 2018-08-10 00:37:30 Let's all be honest. Final Smash Meter is cool af and would be hype.

BUT for Tournament Setting idk. Hazard toggle, 3 stocks, more legal stages. A bunch of steps in the direction of a clean, fair, no bullshit meta.

Adding final smash is like a step back.
4749 2018-08-10 00:35:02 What's being brave? Buying stocks when valuations are at all-time highs and expected returns are shit? You know every time valuations have been this high, precious metals investments have outperformed over next 10-15 years???? There's a case against Gold but you do a poor job.
4750 2018-08-10 00:33:55 Stamina mode with stocks is effectively tournament legal for a side event, which is really cool when you think of all the other possibilities also being introduced.
4751 2018-08-10 00:33:17 Anyone else think it’s super weird that a Congressman could go to prison for 20 years for allegedly getting private information about investing in stocks but Brock Turner went to jail for three months for getting caught red handed RAPING someone? #merica
4752 2018-08-10 00:33:03 omfg, this is me so much. i tend to make my own soups, using stocks (like chicken or vegetable stock), and adding veggies and stuff, but one of my faves is campbell’s chicken won ton: it’s 50cals for a serving, 125, for a can. i water it down so so much giving me more soup.

4755 2018-08-10 00:32:45 ooOOOoo
4756 2018-08-10 00:30:48 Or have common sense gun laws like registering guns better mental and background checks banning ar 15 and all military style guns liscensing guns. Cars are more regulated than guns. Why does a person have to have a liscense to fish but not to own a gun. Also ban bump stocks!!!

4758 2018-08-10 00:28:16 Yeah, those bump stocks are used all of the time to murder people... 
4759 2018-08-10 00:27:19 Looking for stocks to invest in 
4760 2018-08-10 00:27:15 I hate how TO’s and pros and some people are so damn scared of change. 2 stocks was stupid and tournaments ignored so many stages. It ruins it, stop ruining it.
4761 2018-08-10 00:26:36 Stocks: Global stock market risk index changed from positive to neutral due to weak Latin American stock markets. Our global stock market risk flagship was at 40% at US market close.

Bonds: The global bond market risk index remained negative and finished at 62% (last week: 69%).
4762 2018-08-10 00:26:02 Regardless of poverty, there's the issue of growth and resource consumption. Capitalism requires endless growth, but we're already consuming resources at unsustainable rates and can't continue on that path forever. How is destruction of our environment & resource stocks benign?
4763 2018-08-10 00:25:36 Deadass sold half my stocks

4765 2018-08-10 00:24:09 I have others stocks to look at. This means I have to spend part of my time watching and researching them instead of arguing in circulars with an unknown person who has nothing to lose but time. Time is money here. I already missed a few opportunities with your discussion.
4766 2018-08-10 00:23:20 Perhaps the stocks!
4767 2018-08-10 00:22:14 lol, u have no clue do u ?
these "friends" did not become rich by buying overpriced POS stocks like turdsla
4768 2018-08-10 00:21:53 It doesn’t shock me much, the only one that stocks it in SF/Bay Area I believe is one really high grossing Sephora right in the centre of the city 
4769 2018-08-10 00:21:38 Fuelled by: iconic iPhone, iTunes, AppStore, iPods, iPads, AppleWatch, Industry-leading Tax Optimisation, Market-leading stocks buybacks, low paid Chinese workers, ...did I leave anything behind?..
4770 2018-08-10 00:21:36 We endorse @repdinatitus for #NV01. Dina Titus advocates improving the background-check system for gun purchases. She's also proven she can move beyond politics as usual, working with Republicans on legislation concerning bump stocks, and children & gun safety. #Midterms2018
4771 2018-08-10 00:21:23 Imo if we're gonna have final smash meter and it works out and they get balanced then I think we should use 4 stocks but then again it does depend on how they balance them
4772 2018-08-10 00:21:13 @fundstrat tom, get back talking about stocks and the market. Enough with this crypto currency
4773 2018-08-10 00:20:16 I feel like this is actually a kinda iffy question. Maybe would be able to do 2 stocks (no rage since you can toggle that ig) or 3 stocks with rage
4774 2018-08-10 00:19:46 One question: If you win, can we place him in stocks on the Mall?

<wink!>
4775 2018-08-10 00:19:42 I will continue to buy all the ‘Rasul Douglas is a safety’ stocks that exist. That’s a classic center fielder play on the INT
4776 2018-08-10 00:19:24 Check out the Kinetics Paradigm Fund and their other funds. They have long term positions in stocks such as Texas Pacific Land Trust (TPL) and Liberty Sirius (LSXMK) that are not in the SPX.
4777 2018-08-10 00:16:18 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your insomnia
4778 2018-08-10 00:15:56 That's what I also lean in my small tenure, I use twitter to know wht masses are thinking and do exactly opposite, 90% of the time you make money or prevent big losses,
4779 2018-08-10 00:15:44 Will utilize #Robinhood until I have enough capital for E-Mini Futures
4780 2018-08-10 00:15:05 The ruble falls as much as 5% and russian stocks drop 9% as McTrumpcake monkeys offers few details on new curbs
4781 2018-08-10 00:14:10 $EMA.TO increased its dividend starting with payment date of mid November. It has been a great investment for me so far #dividends #passiveincome #stocks
4782 2018-08-10 00:11:17 I probably own way more stocks and cryptocurrency than Shoes and socks. 
4783 2018-08-10 00:09:53 I legit thought Future dropped 100K on STOCKS... I was like dam ok!! But No.. it was socks. He dropped $100k on socks. 
4784 2018-08-10 00:07:57 Doug:  the restaurant and fast food stocks are at ridiculous valuations generally (Dominos in particular looks eye popping) but agree that PZZA offers value on a comparative basis.
4785 2018-08-10 00:07:15 No. Firstly I said reasonable price. These stocks are NEVER cheap. But they are reasonablely priced IF growth happens. Value investing will slap a target price on it and sell it when it reaches “fair value”. 
4786 2018-08-10 00:06:44 Too the stocks with that harlet  #bb20
4787 2018-08-10 00:04:33 No sé sinceramente si hay diferencias... Considero que hablar de 'ahorro' cuando estás refiriendo a stocks monetarios, cheques, tarjeta de crédito, etc., es una forma muy de multiplicar -o supermultiplicar - errores conceptuales, preguntas pelotudas y conclusiones ridículas.
4788 2018-08-10 00:04:07 When a company is using “dilution,” do they normally SELL THE STOCK IN SMALL TRADES REALLY QUICKLY RIGHT AS THE #STOCK PRICE STARTS TO GO UP FAST?

Asking for a friend from $HMNY...
