2 2018-10-17 23:48:36 Also, bananas are weird. They require a lot of vertical integration, vs commodities like handicrafts. Fast turnaround, lack of differentiation within the marketplace, etc. Totally different commodity chain.
3 2018-10-17 23:44:46 It's a like giant game of monopoly, players in and out of political spheres and bureaucracies vie for ALL the markets and commodities
4 2018-10-17 23:38:04 Very True. Credit tightening is going on & so the General Commodities & CRB Index is Moving Down.
5 2018-10-17 23:24:25 Lets see The President is worried about the FED(Commodities/Inflation ) and Oil Prices  (IEAReports) ....HOW CONVENIENT!!! I wonder if investors can put in THEIR orders as to which commodity reports can be MANIPULATED?? Philly Semis/Copper/OIL/Silver? @WSJ @cvpayne @IEA
6 2018-10-17 23:16:59 Israel allows free access of food, medicine and commodities into the strip daily, this is not a siege meant to starve a population but a naval blockade meant to prevent arms smuggling.
Gaza shares a border with Egypt Israel does not control, they can leave if Egypt allows. 1.5/2
7 2018-10-17 23:12:06 It depends. Physical prices in other commodities markets (e.g. gas) have been manipulated via cash settled markets. There are instances of various ISDA contracts (interest rate swaps, CDSs) and other synthetics that had feedback on underlying prices.
8 2018-10-17 23:04:54 Lula pegou o Brasil no melhor momento, com alta das commodities! Trocou a dívida externa a 2.2% pela interna a 4%. Largou com a dívida nominal com 70% do PIB, 13 milhões de desempregados e faliu a indústria Brasileira. Em suma, atrasou o país e tem gente que acha que foi bom!
9 2018-10-17 22:53:08 The eastern exports to USA have a cost advantage.  Absolutism, personalization of political power, arbitrariness and rejection of human rights norms are much cheaper commodities.

12 2018-10-17 22:43:01 Definitely something to keep in mind when we discuss commodities #OSIF18FA
13 2018-10-17 22:36:56 When the government starts overtaxing gasoline and other necessary commodities, it is about control of the masses.  Everything the Democrats do is to make Americans slaves to the government....totally needy for necessities to live their lives.
14 2018-10-17 22:32:48 we are oppressed/enslaved/commodities, but we are NOT free, NOT EVEN CLOSE.
15 2018-10-17 22:21:19 Está na hora do Brasil considerar commodities como bens estratégicos da nação e do povo e elevá-las ao status que a Noruega trata de seu petróleo.
16 2018-10-17 22:20:01 Commodities: Coffee +4.04%, Lean Hogs -3.82%
Top commodity gainers are Coffee (4.04%), Sugar (3.62%) and Natural gas (2.16%). Biggest losers are Lean Hogs (-3.82%), Crude Oil (-2.84%) and Gasoline (-2.80%).
17 2018-10-17 22:07:52 Supply and demand. As tariff reduce supply of imported steel, prices will increase. That is the free market at work. If you want government to control steel prices and other key commodities, vote Democrat and Socialisim. See how that works for you.
