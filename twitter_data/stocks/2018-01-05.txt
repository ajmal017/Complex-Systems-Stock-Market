3 2018-01-07 23:58:00 I wanna buy some green bay Packers stocks so I can be an owner of that team too
4 2018-01-07 23:57:28 The jobs come from many ordinary people having money to spend on more than basic needs. They spend that money (instead of putting it in stocks or offshore accounts) at ordinary, mostly local businesses (not foreign yacht builders) which allows said businesses to expand & hire.
5 2018-01-07 23:56:45 Pretty sure the ranges I read about were up to 400KM so pretty reasonable. Not sure if the cold weather affects this? My stocks will need to triple up before I would spend that kind of money on a car. Actually, my wife wouldn’t let me even if they did.

9 2018-01-07 23:52:29 One of the amazing things about #altcoins #market is that it goes 24/7.  When #America isn't trading #Korea is.  When Korea isn't #Europe is.

10 2018-01-07 23:52:16 For someone claiming the government should not interfere with the market, you sure seem eager to be praised for what the market did. If stocks had dropped and jobs were lost, you wouldn’t have had had anything to do with it.

17 2018-01-07 23:49:12 Sounds like your feeling nervous. You can sell off those stocks before the bubble burst but if it’s tied to a 401k good luck with that. Besides it’s all a crapshoot anyway and we all leave this world the same way we came in, it’s the in between that counts.

42 2018-01-07 23:47:11 I’m starting to think you don’t know that much about economics. Stock market is but one indicator, and not even that good of one of the overall health of the economy. Vast majority of stocks owned by a small percentage of population.
43 2018-01-07 23:46:37 Half of all adult American citizenry does NOT own stocks and doesn’t benefit! But you don’t care about working class, low/middle class families, only wealthy friends, donors, corporations and yourself.  More lies and paranoia. You are deeply flawed, unfit, unstable.
44 2018-01-07 23:46:29 More rich getting richer, leaving the rest of us behind.  The forgotten men and women of this country do not have excess money to invest in stocks.
45 2018-01-07 23:46:20 I won’t propose a fix-all plan like Australia’s very successful ban, because I recognize 2A right

Mandatory liability insurance (as with vehicles)

Registration of all sales and transfers (again, as we do with vehicles)

Limits on capacity and work-around items like bump stocks

59 2018-01-07 23:38:25 Less than 50% of Americans own stocks.
60 2018-01-07 23:36:57 It wasn't a "big" win, u lost the general but win u did. Also, most Americans don't own stocks so it does the average Americans very little.
61 2018-01-07 23:36:45 Plus, Medicaid pays so low that it doesn’t cover the cost of overhead while taking care of the patient. ACA is an insurance co taking a cut before paying physicians and hospitals. Why did insurance co stocks go up with passage of ACA?
62 2018-01-07 23:35:48 The Stock market doesn’t create jobs. It creates wealth for a few. Most workers don’t own stocks. The market is no barometer of the economy. Didn’t they teach you that at the best schools?
63 2018-01-07 23:35:32 I think the fact that is is such an uncertain, obscure and nerdy  investment largely accounts for that. In the stock market, even highly  volatile stocks are a part of a 100+ year old institution which, in and  of itself, has a quantifiable track-record.
64 2018-01-07 23:34:09 I'm not one to demonize Wall Street, but I know people who do, and they argue (perhaps correctly) that while officially, no one is "barred" from owning/trading stocks, for many Americans struggling to put food on the table, that's a luxury they can't afford, which shuts them out
65 2018-01-07 23:33:02 Put it this way America could say they are legalizing in 10 years time and these marijuana stocks in America would be massive until then so would Canadian stocks because they would get into the America industry too.
66 2018-01-07 23:32:57 Stocks  Jobs . . .
67 2018-01-07 23:32:13 How’s the market’s valuation look?  Putting us in another $Trillion of debt will only force rates up.  When rates go up, stocks go down, in case you were not aware.
68 2018-01-07 23:31:53 Most Americans don’t give a flying hoot about stocks, Donny. Most of us just want to make enough money to bring food to the table. Goes to show how out of touch you are with the idiot folks who voted you in.

71 2018-01-07 23:30:44 The 2017 equity momentum extended into 2018 as global stocks finished the year’s opening week with extremely strong gains (WTD/YTD performance: SPX +2.5%, Nasdaq +3.3%, SX5E +2.96%, SXXP +2.1%, NKY +4.17%, Hang Seng +2.99%, HSCEI +4.29%, SHCOMP +2.56%, etc.).
72 2018-01-07 23:28:30 If "world goes to shit"... #Commodities would be all anyone cares about... #Oil & #Gold without question, but Food too! Fiat would be worthless depending on which nations involved, #Cryptos would clearly be worthless as they already have no value or use, #Stocks would go to zero.
73 2018-01-07 23:28:00 Most people can't afford to buy on the dip. If they could afford stocks, they'd already be invested. They're more concerned with feeding their children and paying their rent.
74 2018-01-07 23:27:56 Money has been made. If you invest now you are simply too late to the party. It's only speculation right now. Numbers don't back the investment anymore. It has nothing to do with the end of prohibition. It is about how these stocks are overvalued
75 2018-01-07 23:27:34 See if theres no a space for something it probably means we dont stock it and just because everywhere else stocks it doesn’t mean we have too

81 2018-01-07 23:23:51 Hey genius,  the stock market doesn’t create jobs. Most of your base still doesn’t own stocks. They are drowning in debt. They do like to see you do this though so they think things are getting better for them because they are so simple.
82 2018-01-07 23:22:56 Only the 1% make real money when stocks go up. 50 % don't own stocks.

84 2018-01-07 23:20:33 Oh. Really?  Let me go sell some of my stocks to pay for my two college kids tuition this month. Oh, snap. That’s right I don’t have any. I work for a living. Have since I was 11. In blue collar jobs with no stock options or 401k.
85 2018-01-07 23:20:31 Can't see any trace of death in d pix, dude's probably depressed from the news of his crashed stocks. And do he lays helpless on his sit after a nervous breakdown and turning his office upside down. He'll soon brace up and get on his feet, trust me
86 2018-01-07 23:19:44 Actually, as far as Trump goes, it doesn't b/c he has said he doesn't invest in stocks (he thinks it's not smart) he only launders money in real estate.  Had he actually invested his inheritance he could have spent his life playing golf and be $8B richer.
87 2018-01-07 23:19:41 Mr president, that's great for the wealthy who own a majority of the stocks. The problem is, they put that huge profit in their pockets. It doesn't trickle down. That's why we have stagnant wages. That's why we have poverty. That's why we have the biggest wealth gap in the world.
88 2018-01-07 23:18:49 Only half country owns stocks? I doubt that figure but assuming it is true, why?
89 2018-01-07 23:18:35 Insolent uneducated nobody,We elected Him and we ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS,my bank and stocks account triple ,OUR COUNTRY its respectable again,grow up You ignorant nobody!! Rgds Dr Farrugio

92 2018-01-07 23:17:09 Kings never made many more kings. Those in power don't want great or even good for us. They want, struggle and set back so their power reigns elite. Fck them policy tweakers. @jeffsessions
93 2018-01-07 23:17:09 Isn't that the purpose of retirement accounts? Investing (wisely) in diversified stocks, mutual funds, etc. puts our money to work while we are otherwise occupied. Few people get rich on a salary, but even those with menial jobs can invest young and retire well. That's a problem?

97 2018-01-07 23:15:36 Stocks and whipping post
98 2018-01-07 23:15:34 Why do I have to keep explaining that higher prices for something do not create value? The people having the stocks made money off the people who sold them, that doesn't increase everyone's total wealth.
99 2018-01-07 23:14:47 The majority don't own stocks. That only benefits your rich benefactors. Otherwise, the economy was better under Obama-No-Drama! We miss him
100 2018-01-07 23:14:29 No, the stock market has been creating more wealth for the wealthy and for speculators. Most people don't own stocks. The average person gets nothing from a higher stock market except the downside when the bubble pops.
101 2018-01-07 23:14:09 and yet 50% of the country own no stocks.... so the people who need help the most are the ones not getting any.

111 2018-01-07 23:08:16 Am I correct that 40% of stocks are owned by foreign entities? How does a booming stock market help average Americans?

114 2018-01-07 23:07:20 80% of the stocks are held by the rich. Do you think at a person with 20 bucks in his pocket trying to feed a family give a shit about  how high it is.

120 2018-01-07 23:03:01 Not everyone works for Fortune 500 companies, most aren’t invested in 401k either. The top 1% owns the majority of the stocks. Simple enough?
121 2018-01-07 23:02:50 Well I agree nobody should get harassed but they got too much money to be sitting on Twitter reading hate comments. They can go buy some stocks or something. Stop worrying about kids who think they're edgy or cool cause they tweet hate about a group
122 2018-01-07 23:00:35 Getting tired of hearing how great the stock market is doing. 52% of America doesn’t get squat from stocks. A poor choice of economic growth
123 2018-01-07 23:00:21 I think they still have stocks for that kind of behaviour here. (It's chalk, promise!)
124 2018-01-07 23:00:12 Most economists agree that the stock market only benefits the top 10% in wealth. Half of US citizens don’t own stocks.
125 2018-01-07 23:00:03 "There are times when money can be made investing & speculating in stocks, but money cannot consistently be made trading every day or every week during the year.

126 2018-01-07 23:00:01 What about the millions of people who can’t afford stocks.
127 2018-01-07 22:58:56 Wow,are you the most clueless president ever?Yep, you are.Dow only represents 100 stocks, not the entire market, right?You know the average US family does not own stock? You know the market is always artificially inflated after the holidays, right?If you don’t know this, why not?
128 2018-01-07 22:58:55 You don't understand that the stock market benefits the wealthy who can afford stocks, it does nothing for the middle class
129 2018-01-07 22:58:50 In the stock market, if there is no real value in the company and the value of the stock is still up because of the market rally, it's just a paper number... people that are benefiting right now are the ones who own the stocks and only if they sell higher than they bought them.
130 2018-01-07 22:58:11 Thank you for taking a principled stance. The public should be able to  be confident that best practice, ethical behaviours and wider environmental and health contexts are at the heart of managing our tree stocks. They demand custodianship for the benefit of future generations.

134 2018-01-07 22:56:32 No that would still be in U.S. Dollars... you need to pay attention in your finance/economic classes dawg... I'm not talking about "not trusting money in U.S. bank"... I keep my money stored in other places like #Oil $CL_F, #Gold $GC_F, #Stocks, other countries #FX, even #Crypto.
135 2018-01-07 22:55:41 Since crypto is an extremely bull market right now it's a lot easier to make profits than it is when trading stocks.
136 2018-01-07 22:55:32 Mr. President :: The Market is going great guns.
BUT how about our savings accounts for those who 
could only use the Banks to save money.

Interest Rates & CDS are 1% or less

Pls Help the common people without stocks

137 2018-01-07 22:54:45 That is good that those people are getting rich on stocks and gambling. They should think about using their business acumen to build a business that employs others and provides for their families, it is more satisfying than flexing keyboard muscles all day.
138 2018-01-07 22:54:33 Remember when you said that obama wire tapped microwaves? Get back to reality. If you stupidly think bitcoin will keep american stocks high, then I have a plot in Russia to sell you.
139 2018-01-07 22:53:08 Im slowly getting more invested into stocks...trying make small yet smart business moves
140 2018-01-07 22:52:47 This came out after they got their #TaxCut & are buying back all sorts of stocks!!!
141 2018-01-07 22:52:34 The stock market is doing very well! Of course, poor people do not have stocks. Too bad for you, working class poor! Also, The stock market does NOT = the *Economy*.
142 2018-01-07 22:50:42 any stocks I'm not on I want I'm waiting for a market pul back now
143 2018-01-07 22:50:14 The stock markets do nothing for the average individual. It has helped businessmen and companies, and the rich! Your average voter who elected you, has no stocks!
144 2018-01-07 22:49:31 Yeah, so inept as r country is safer than before, stronger, richer, I bet ur 401k (if you have one) or stocks are fatter, we’ve brought jobs back, unemployment is down, we’re improving our crumbling infrastructure, food stamps down. hate Trump but even you r doing well under him
145 2018-01-07 22:49:09 How’s your stocks doing? Oh, I forgot you sold everything.
146 2018-01-07 22:48:14 there are people there that are retired by age 35 making 100k on stocks and betting onn games what are you doing hammer 

call me when you win a bet
147 2018-01-07 22:48:14 Property really isn’t the game for wealth anymore, Ima stick to the stocks and crypto
148 2018-01-07 22:48:10 Only 50% of the country own ANY stocks, and 85% of all stocks are owned by the top 10%. Stock prices have ZERO relationship to jobs. What have you done for the bottom 50 %?
149 2018-01-07 22:48:09 Too bad that only the top 10% of wage earners own 92% of all US stocks. Pretty clear who it is you truly care about.
150 2018-01-07 22:47:54 got into stocks a few years ago with my dad's advice/supervision, can't tell you off the top of my head all the names I invested in but just recently came into the money for it and decided fuck it im going cryptocurrency bois
151 2018-01-07 22:47:42 Alan you are helping push the valuations of these stocks higher and helping spread the word to those who ant to invest but don't know how
152 2018-01-07 22:47:16 So many good stocks right now, kid in a candy shop! 
153 2018-01-07 22:45:49 That’s kinda what I believe as well Brian...that doesn’t mean that stocks only go one way tho...but they still seem good today..
154 2018-01-07 22:45:32 Sorry 
Not going 2 do that Bernie.  Have you checked your stocks value ?
155 2018-01-07 22:45:09 As far as your average person that does not own stocks, does not benefit from less regulations, and got 18 bucks a week in the cut he has done almost nothing except golf 1/3 of his first year. AFTER criticism of 44 and promise to not golf at all.
156 2018-01-07 22:44:48 We were expecting a lot more investment in the cheese selection which I’d been curating for some weeks... however the Malbec stocks were severely depleted across a fortnight ( three cases)
157 2018-01-07 22:43:44 And that would be a good thing.  How many public pension plans own those stocks?  Stock repurchases also put cash in the hands of investors to invest in other companies if they wish.  Yes I know the Rs sold this differently but this is still better than than the status quo.
158 2018-01-07 22:43:33 "In August, 2014, CNN Money reported rather quizzically that Renaissance Technologies was deepening its investments in two huge Russian telecom companies whose stocks were in rapid decline, "
159 2018-01-07 22:43:30 Who are the TALENs stocks?
160 2018-01-07 22:43:23 This only helps the rich that own stocks, and the CFO's. Stop bullshitting the American people.
161 2018-01-07 22:43:17 Stock market is going into the pockets of those who can afford to buy stocks. Who r they??? Rich upper middle class. Otherwise it does nothing for us regular people.
162 2018-01-07 22:43:05 Accomplishments, Stock market? rich people got more rich!! Regulations cut? More rich making more money? Tax cut? Yep, you guessed it. I'll just assume B.N. is a millionaire that owns enough stocks, dirty companies and has so much wealth that he qualifies for any of the bennies
163 2018-01-07 22:41:51 OMG that’s class  knew them fairy’s were up to something 
164 2018-01-07 22:41:07 Thanks for the heads up. Great looking chart. Gold stocks should really get in gear after a little pause. Cheers
165 2018-01-07 22:40:23 Tax reform...
Gorsich...
Dodd frank...
Dec 21st executive order...
My family is getting bonuses and lessened tax burden...
My stocks are soaring!
Just off the top and in addition to what he said about pedos. Unplug and research just a little.  Leave your ego out of it.  Truth
166 2018-01-07 22:40:19 How stupid are you? The rise in the stock market only benefits the rich (who own the stocks) and the ½ of the population that have retirement accounts.  To the rest it means nothing @POTUS #Trump!
167 2018-01-07 22:40:18 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
168 2018-01-07 22:39:57 Hair soaked, frozen to the bone, swearing and cursing Steve for being so late Bet the people driving past me thought I was a right bloody nutter!
169 2018-01-07 22:38:44 Worth repeating: "Celebrating the ballooning value of stocks seems a counter-intuitive way for [Trump] to stay connected to the "forgotten men and women" on whom he based his 2016 victory." #MAGA #RESIGN
170 2018-01-07 22:38:38 Bump stocks are an abomination.
171 2018-01-07 22:38:14 @greggutfeld 
My question is this..Why is it that the US has made it impossible to buy into cryptocurrency??  I have been trying while watching XRP stocks rising several hundred %. I just watched a video explaining the reason being due to US dollar collapsing..whats your thought?
172 2018-01-07 22:37:58 what did people do before stocks,welfare and almighty Social S? They depended on family. Welfare?!?
173 2018-01-07 22:37:34 Only the wealthiest Americans care because they own most all the stocks since the great recession. The rest is stocks that were bought back by the same corporations that own them. #itsatrap
174 2018-01-07 22:37:29 Mate I’m speechless  maybe there’s like bus petrol stations 
175 2018-01-07 22:37:26 And just how many of your supporters actually own stocks? I doubt many except your billionaire friends. Jobs? What happened to carrier? Jobs lost. You really have not done squat. Keep lying to yourself
176 2018-01-07 22:36:56 Stocks do NOT create jobs. Show me where you see the correlation.
177 2018-01-07 22:36:48 Did you sell your stocks as promised or did you hang on for that capital gains gift Trump got you?
178 2018-01-07 22:35:41 Record setting stock prices only benefits the owners of stocks, primarily a very very small portion of the population. Just like your tax cuts that benefit, in the long run, a very small portion of the population. Mostly the same stock owners. Roaring stocks do not create jobs.
179 2018-01-07 22:34:59 I am sure you heard the famous quote: “It’s the economy, stupid”. No one cares about more US govt debt anymore b/c we have “bitcoin” now. So, the elections may end up same, if stocks do well, unemployment remains steady and home prices appreciate. Likely!!!
180 2018-01-07 22:34:52 Someone should create a cryptocoin backed by Italian automotive stocks and call it Fiat Currency
181 2018-01-07 22:34:21 Killed me 
182 2018-01-07 22:33:31 Nice for people who own stocks, but for me with a disabled Vietnam vet & on the verge of losing everything not so good. We all voted for you but nothing has helped us... Shame that people that earned our own way through life will end up like this. Please retweet this many times.
183 2018-01-07 22:33:12 I wish you luck in the trade, you have a good one. If interested, have a look at the others I mentioned $sltk $weyl $orgs . All good stocks and heading higher
184 2018-01-07 22:32:15 Oh there are millions of liberal excuses for “what Miller did.” He used a lib tactic against the lib MSM. And y’all can’t handle that he was right. Just like you can’t handle that @POTUS is incredibly successful as POTUS.  GDP, stocks up, taxes & unemployment WAY down.
185 2018-01-07 22:32:02 To my great honor to the United States than even worse than I have every right now allows us on Stocks put more specific-but
186 2018-01-07 22:30:58 Reminder to Donald......Your supporters do not own stocks nor do they invest in stock market.

precious metals, money market accounts, CD’s, IRA’s, or real estate.
189 2018-01-07 22:29:54 May be but your ag just killed my portfolio of mj stocks.  The a hole.
190 2018-01-07 22:29:14 Is there an app similar to coinbase that lets me invest in regular stocks from my phone instead of crypto???
191 2018-01-07 22:28:36 Question: who owns all the stocks? Why does the average American benefit from a good stock market?
192 2018-01-07 22:28:31 You do know that 50% of America doesn’t own stocks That stock prices are strong because you just cut corporate taxes so their bottom lines are up and stock buy backs are in full swing Also jobs for 2017 lower than previous yr you sir are a LIAR
193 2018-01-07 22:26:56 I'd sell now if I had stocks.
194 2018-01-07 22:26:18 I have a feeling you're going to be just fine with $IDK. If you've done your homework I don't think you can go wrong if you put it a market order for SX tmrw morning and wait out the week. Let me know what you think
195 2018-01-07 22:25:20 What stocks and/or bonds do you have?
So I can tell my broker which ones to buy, or sell, as well?
196 2018-01-07 22:24:09 Lol!! Good luck!! I’m putting some of my stocks on Prozac and any antidepressant drug manufacturers I can find...plenty of money to make from depressed Dumbcrats!! This is SOOO GOOD!! 
197 2018-01-07 22:23:13 Let’s take a count here. Please reply if you own stocks and are benefiting from the stock market. If your part of the 1% it doesn’t count. Only hard working middle class Americans need to reply
198 2018-01-07 22:22:45 2018 will be a great year for EVERYONE because everyone down my TL and on FB are getting into stocks... GONE HEAD AND MAKE THEM  MOVES!!!!
199 2018-01-07 22:22:16 82% of stocks are owned by top 10%. Stop rubbing into your " forgotten man"
200 2018-01-07 22:21:15 Stocks have been up in anticipation of the GOP tax cut on corporations raising profits. That doesn't mean the economy's doing well, though some of that might turn into more hiring or more capital investment instead of more stock buybacks or dividends.
201 2018-01-07 22:21:04 Good stocks!  Featured ARS in my first Poll of the year and i'll feature it again soon
202 2018-01-07 22:20:45 The whole fleet should be kept in dock permanently, "Japan Does Not" have the "Right to Hun, Capture or Kill Dolphins Anywhere"
They continue to treat Dolphins as the reason for depleted fish stocks in the Oceans. Whereas it is their own rape & over fishing that is the problem ?
203 2018-01-07 22:20:12 Only the rich has stocks sir.  So your only pleasing the wealthy which is why your going down in history as the worst president ever!
204 2018-01-07 22:19:52 That's all an effect of Obama era policies. The average person can't even afford to play with stocks. I thought you were supposed to be the "poor person's president"! #urarobberbaron
205 2018-01-07 22:19:30 Dude you need to wake up, jobs are at their lowest in 7 years, yes the stock market is up, but it's due to corporations buying up their own stocks and growth is on par with what it's been for several years. Trumps done nothing,  but possibly ruined the environment
206 2018-01-07 22:18:49 These weed stocks looking right..
207 2018-01-07 22:18:44 Like most of the country, I don't own stocks, so how does a lower corporate tax (and resulting surge in the debt) benefit me?
208 2018-01-07 22:18:39 And how do high stocks help a cashier at a grocery store , or a stocker at Walmart ? Or a burger flipper at McDonald's ? 

Uhh it doesn't =u=;
209 2018-01-07 22:18:36 @GrooveCubeMusic and @BolideOfficial always buy htis beautiful stocks ??
210 2018-01-07 22:18:05 Have you checked the market capitalization? How many stocks? In reality 4 or 5.
211 2018-01-07 22:17:55 Except your Stocks and 401k looking sharp.  I thank god everyday Hillary is not president!
212 2018-01-07 22:17:54 Not in mine. I do not own stocks, my understanding is, only the wealthy profit there. Life long democrat here.
213 2018-01-07 22:17:43 #MAGA: Indonesia is not sinking! The glaciers are not melting! Drill baby! Drill! Yay for the DOW! It’s not helping me b/c I don’t work on Wall St or own stocks, but YAY! Don’t pay our SS & take away Medicare! Our Pres is NOT a whining baby! He’s, like, really smart. Totally dude
214 2018-01-07 22:17:12 Looks like my street stocks that I raced on dirt , had 81 Camaro that I made body’s for from colored aluminum no paint needed
215 2018-01-07 22:17:00 Need to find some rims ASAP I be floating doin 100 on my stocks like it’s 65 
216 2018-01-07 22:15:56 10% of the population owns 90% of the stocks. The stock market doesn’t affect the rest of us. You only care about the richest Americans so once again, until you prove otherwise you’re #notmypresident.
217 2018-01-07 22:15:48 IF THEY DON'T HAVE STOCKS THEY HAVE 401K AND MINE IS BOOMING!
218 2018-01-07 22:15:22 That’s really what it’s about for rich Republicans isn’t it, worshipping the almighty $. Even if it’s at the expense of “regular” people. Did you learn nothing from the real estate/banking collapse? Over-inflated things eventually burst! Banks, real estate and eventually stocks.
219 2018-01-07 22:15:00 S&P Futures have rallied for 4 days in a row, adding a total of 74.25 points (+2.8%), making this the biggest 4 day gain since 10 November 2016, 289 trading days earlier #stocks
220 2018-01-07 22:14:29 Eddie when u receive a nice tax refund send it to me because u do not deserve it and by the way how is your stocks doing moron !
221 2018-01-07 22:14:12 10% of the population controls 80% of stocks.  And corporations are doing record levels of buying their own stocks, artificially driving up the price of stocks.  The stock market does not reflect stagnant income of the majority of Main Street.
222 2018-01-07 22:12:44 Hey Ian!  Sorry I didn't see your comment sooner.  We don't focus on Crpyto trading, however, I do have a crypto account and trade the same exact patterns and strategies as I use for Penny stocks.  So yes, it definitely works!
223 2018-01-07 22:12:39 @MomentumAdvice Are you all familiar with Cassandra Cummings founder of Stocks and Stilettos Society? She’s teaching women that look like us how to invest in the stock market.
224 2018-01-07 22:12:23 As usual this is another lie from you. The average American owns NO stocks. The top 10% own 80% of the stock. You are making the very wealthy even wealthier, and  giving them most of the tax cuts as well. The top 1% will end up owning even more of our Nation's wealth.
225 2018-01-07 22:11:14 heavily guarded briefcase that can rectify vulnerable stocks
226 2018-01-07 22:10:53 With rates this low it makes sense. I agree with Buffet, if yield on longer term bonds shoots higher this will end badly. If in 4 years the 10 year bond is still at 2.4%, stocks aren't currently ridiculously expensive.
227 2018-01-07 22:10:33 My ex-wife took all my stocks. I hope they crash
228 2018-01-07 22:10:16 92% of the stocks are owned by the top 20% of wealthiest people. In other words the orange sheep that voted for you aren’t any richer today than last year. Idiot.

230 2018-01-07 22:10:00 The Dow has rallied for 6 of the last 7 weeks, adding a total of 1938 points (+8.3%), making this the biggest 7 week gain seen in the 54 weeks since 23 December 2017 #stocks
231 2018-01-07 22:09:57 Some indicators are now at a point where any small disturbance of these quasi-stable mean-reverting markets may cause a large correction. First time I see these kind of signals and high risks in stocks. It may get ugly. #SPX $SPY
232 2018-01-07 22:09:45 what about people that have NOTHING to do with stocks, that is NOT what it is all about! Besides you can thank Obama for that, you don't even know how it works huh? But I thought you were, like, smart.! LMAO!
233 2018-01-07 22:09:10 Someone teach me stocks
234 2018-01-07 22:08:42 #marijuanastocks still top on my active trading list as speculation of congressional backlash against J. Sessions increases.

238 2018-01-07 22:07:30 Get him and put him in the old style stocks
239 2018-01-07 22:07:29 Layerstyles, Colorful stocks that aren't in every fucking mixo pack
240 2018-01-07 22:07:21 What percentage of US citizens own stocks, sir? What percentage of US citizens experience these "tremendous benefits"?
241 2018-01-07 22:07:18 You're an idiot. 2017 was the worst year for jobs, the stock market benefits the wealthy, How many average workers or poor people own stocks? Raise the federal Minimum wage to $15. That would help regular working Americans, You're not interested in helping anyone but the wealthy
242 2018-01-07 22:05:48 10% own over 80% of stocks/bonds. Half f Americans don't own any stock. Job recovery is a little less than under Obama and wage growth isn't keeping up with inflation.
243 2018-01-07 22:05:47 BUSINESSES are closing down all around us but stocks are doing great certain stocks are any way how much do you have invested alot of safe guards to protect the small guy and people very little recourse if they loose have been done away with no longer do the brokers have to care
244 2018-01-07 22:04:12 the trailing 10-year, annualized return for an investor in the S&P 500 is going to go from 6.2% to 11.5% this fall (assumes flat market until then for simplicity). stocks will look much friendlier to many allocation models. #stocks $SPY
245 2018-01-07 22:03:56 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
246 2018-01-07 22:03:26 Stocks represent future, not past.
247 2018-01-07 22:03:12 The average American couldn’t care less as evidenced by your 32% approval rating. Maybe they realize that 80% of stocks are owned by the top 10% of Americans. In other words, they main people that are helped by this are the only people you actually care about, the wealthy.
248 2018-01-07 22:02:48 Hoping everyone has a great week. I missed the boat big time last January by misaligning my PF and not trusting myself. Pleased to say I’m locked and loaded this time round with some great looking stocks.

250 2018-01-07 22:02:02 The United States should not admit those into Insurance stocks, which will ALL
251 2018-01-07 22:01:22 What stocks and/or bonds do you have stake in?
I'll let my broker know which ones are the most profitable

253 2018-01-07 22:00:24 Most Americans can't afford to own stocks. The stock market does not create jobs, you moron. And you can't points to anything or corrupt and incompetent regime has done that has affected the stock market.
254 2018-01-07 22:00:06 stfu about the stock market dude. I doubt many poor or middle-class people can even afford to invest in stocks. This mostly benefits you and you creepy worshipers. Fuck outta here

257 2018-01-07 21:59:36 Here's the source that projected Obama's increase in stocks if he were to have used Trump's executive power to remove all the restrictions...? I have no idea how you could project that  clown
258 2018-01-07 21:59:27 I think some CCs and some stocks.
259 2018-01-07 21:58:44 @realDonaldTrump   Only twenty-five percent of the American population owns stocks.
260 2018-01-07 21:58:30 Millions have jobs, but no stocks. What about them? You don't fucking care.
261 2018-01-07 21:57:02 Yeah I always trade off the 60 minute chart. Seems many of these MJ stocks respond well to the 60 minute chart/moving averages
262 2018-01-07 21:56:03 Liar. It makes money for those who own stock. It's a gamble and much of the time it's rigged. The dividends paid out come out of the income of the company. Stocks don't support the employees. You could say the dividends come out of the employees' pockets.
263 2018-01-07 21:55:26 So a high stock market is an indication that the rich you just gave a massive tax break to just invested in more stocks, because that's what the rich do Donnie, they don't spend they save and invest. Trickle down economics doesn't work
264 2018-01-07 21:54:32 But who benefits not the majority of citizens but those who can afford to buy stocks.
265 2018-01-07 21:54:21 Disabled veterans don't own a lot of stocks. Many are homeless. Did you forget?
266 2018-01-07 21:54:18 Those of us with retirement $$ are complicit too. There’s a reason nearly all pension funds have pharmaceutical stocks. They are guaranteed profits.
267 2018-01-07 21:54:14 literally first 5 min of us being at savemart my nana manages to drop 2 stocks of celery, a sweet potato and a bag of mini tortillasshe had me dead omg i was cryin
268 2018-01-07 21:53:56 I think the last 20 years have demonstrated well the correlation between stocks and good times for the middle and working classes are a crock, especially since their money is basically locked into the market whether it goes up or crashes. I don’t give a damn about the market.
269 2018-01-07 21:53:10 I keep it simple: ‘Top stocks by MarketSmith’ app for historical data, estimates from Estimize. Then throw into a custom excel sheet I’ve been using for years
270 2018-01-07 21:52:58 Thanks Martin, this is helpful and clear. Agreed that your results and Appel et al's can co-exist. I have to admit a struggle with the Russell 1000/2000 ID approach, mostly because id comes from relatively few stocks.
271 2018-01-07 21:52:11 Mo tempão que alguém não me chamava de stocks ...
272 2018-01-07 21:52:07 Assuming US: Journelle has great customer service, stocks a variety of brands, knowledgeable staff and a sale atm. Agent Provocateur has a killer sale atm (eg Riva is pure silk, $60).
273 2018-01-07 21:51:35 ..wake up..every trade union, university, cities, counties, states , credit unions and businesses own securities that raise the economy so all benefit and can own stocks too..
274 2018-01-07 21:51:11 60.% of Americans don’t own stocks
275 2018-01-07 21:50:38 You’re point? Owning stocks, or not, value creation due to increased capital that the companies already earned provides better services and products for the people.
Still, Win-Win for everyone.
276 2018-01-07 21:50:28 Nice! Now I can tell everyone I know to liquidate their stocks to pay for health care, child care, rent, and bills! Thanks for looking out for the little guy, mr. Trump!
277 2018-01-07 21:50:02 Gonna do a lot for all them hard working middle class people with ALL the stocks they own! Another great tweet from the GENIUS! Sad!
278 2018-01-07 21:48:52 Ask if he'll take my 3D printing stocks back at where he recommended them?
279 2018-01-07 21:48:43 About half of Americans don't own stocks. I would bet that includes most of tRump's "base."
280 2018-01-07 21:48:27 Carrier laid off 600, joining AT&T, Cessna, 3 Kentucky coal mines, GM, HH Gregg, Dollar General, Sears, K-Mart...heck, even Burger King is quitting...but I'm sure all those unemployed workers will be happy to learn the stocks they can't afford to buy are doing well...
281 2018-01-07 21:48:23 "Standard & Poor 500 Index fund" is a fund consisting of stocks of the top 500 companies in the US. The performance of this fund is generally considered to represent the country's economy as a whole.
282 2018-01-07 21:48:23 Can i have #stocks with cheese please?
283 2018-01-07 21:48:19 Jobs please explain all the recent layoffs announced by AT&T, Comcast, Sears, Macy’s & Sears? PS your base doesn’t care about stocks they care about jobs! So...please explain!
284 2018-01-07 21:47:55 What % of the population own stocks? And of that percentage how much do they own of the overall pie? And “Your” voters in particular. Hmmm.
285 2018-01-07 21:47:20 Our stocks are better than ever now! Next day delivery  available on most products!! #Bathroom #OnlineBathrooms
286 2018-01-07 21:47:13 Our automated stocks platform will be #Crypto ready soon! Give us a follow to be notified! #btc #ltc #Eth
287 2018-01-07 21:47:11 No Jobs, Jobs, Jobs! Over 12,000 people will be out of work this year alone due to closing stores. Stocks you got lucky on that one. You inherited a country with stocks already thriving. And you really should shut up about this. Every day tweeting the same crap. Makes you really
288 2018-01-07 21:46:53 I have read and seen many self made billionaires and Trump never fits the definition. KKK member dad gave him million $ to start. If he fid not do anything but invest in stocks he would have been real billionaire now not like he lies about his worth & not actually what he is.
289 2018-01-07 21:46:49 Looked okay outside the arena seen him after the game hopefully there isn’t anything wrong!
290 2018-01-07 21:46:20 Regular Friday for me that!! Haha
291 2018-01-07 21:46:19 And we can still buy bump stocks. @SenDeanHeller
292 2018-01-07 21:46:04 Stocks
293 2018-01-07 21:45:59 the only reason the stocks did so good was because the FED kept the prime rate at zero...there was no where else to make money but the market...btw...checkout the market from 11/9/2016 til now...also  ..you forgot...Benghazi...fast and furious...Iran deal....IRS scandal.
294 2018-01-07 21:45:57 In the late stages of a bull market people become willing to pay prices for stocks that assume the good times will go on #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #Ethereum
295 2018-01-07 21:45:55 Less than 1/2 the country owns stocks “genius” #25thamendmentnow
296 2018-01-07 21:45:53 Maybe he should be blocked. In stocks so we can throw rotten veggies at him.
297 2018-01-07 21:45:21 .@panda2018TX points to gun education, comprehensive background checks, and outlawing bump stocks to help with gun violence. Gerrymandering and the NRA are preventing good gun legislation #wtcbluewave
298 2018-01-07 21:45:06 Who stocks radium tank set ups
299 2018-01-07 21:44:57 10% of population owns 84% of stocks.  Not really helping the common man, but Wall Street sure does enjoy those 7 figure bonuses
300 2018-01-07 21:44:50 He bought an entire arsenal of guns and bump stocks and high capacity magazines legally
301 2018-01-07 21:44:49 Making America great?  Stock market has been surging since 2009, my 401k & other stocks have been doing great since. When is it America wasn’t great for you? Nothing has gotten any better since he took office. When he’s impeached or resigns in disgrace, you’ll see you were had.
302 2018-01-07 21:44:37 The stock market only affects those who own stocks. It does not necessarily affect job growth. Companies can choose to hire more people or not. No matter how much wealthier they get from stocks and tax cuts. Study the subject, donniegirl!
303 2018-01-07 21:44:30 The S&P Index is a collection of stocks which are supposed to generally represent the health of the economy as a whole.  Some mutual funds buy stocks in a ratio matching that index, and you can invest in them for stability.
304 2018-01-07 21:44:19 10 pints in I could stick it in some guys shoulder and it could look like a T20!
305 2018-01-07 21:44:09 Are you a socialist who wants to crowd fun an entity that gives back to society? But some stocks! Help these businesses grow and continue to benefit society
306 2018-01-07 21:43:31 Bumpfire stocks don't make a semi-auto full auto

That is determined by internal parts, not a plastic stock that slides back and forth

You have much to learn, #gunsense

307 2018-01-07 21:41:54 Of course. The only way you can profit from sentiment data is taking the opposite position when there is some extreme positioning amongst the market participants. With 34% bearish in stocks however it is not as extreme as only 24% bullish on bonds...
308 2018-01-07 21:41:43 Thank you very much from #Germany. I trade only US stocks cause our useless government doesn't care about markets.
309 2018-01-07 21:41:33 All his oil stocks. Hmmm. Can anyonesay cobflixt of interest?
310 2018-01-07 21:41:19 Australia's Stocks Ascends to a10-Year High
311 2018-01-07 21:41:02 I have had the exact same thought first weed stocks, then crypto now this. The only thing I can find is Tencent on Hong Kong stock exchange but it’s already one of the most expensive stocks in China
312 2018-01-07 21:41:02 In the manner that you are influencing certain stocks and sectors, it a perverse”insider trading scam.” And you can quote me.
313 2018-01-07 21:40:13 Absolute world beater! Reality is, after that amount, just hitting the board is a result!
314 2018-01-07 21:40:13 Job creation has slowed and yes, the stock market is up, up, up. 50% of Americans don't have stocks. Guess you don't care about them.
315 2018-01-07 21:40:09 Calling all investors! My husband and I need a shot in the dark. Please invest in us. #investing #investors #finance #stocks #pennystocks
316 2018-01-07 21:40:06 Ur base doesn't have stocks u fool!  They can't even afford dentists.
317 2018-01-07 21:40:03 How much of that $7 trillion has gone to the people you keep claiming to be fighting for?  You know, the coal miners and middle class working Americans?  You know, the ones who live paycheck to pacheck and own zero stocks?  You’re a clown.
318 2018-01-07 21:39:51 “Mom can I have 100$ to buy stocks with I’m gunna be rich!”
319 2018-01-07 21:39:43 Rich getting richer isnt a reason to celebrate stocks.
320 2018-01-07 21:39:09 No, bump stocks do not turn semi automatic weapons to automatic.
Also, bump firing is a technique not requiring any special stock.
321 2018-01-07 21:38:48 You done any training this week Mike? Yes had 10 pints of coors and 6 whisky chasers....
322 2018-01-07 21:38:36 Public stocks now.
323 2018-01-07 21:37:49 A week is a long time in crypto. I say this a lot

Here's some perspective

Stock market - your stocks are being traded 30 hours a week, 120 hours a month

Crypto - your coins are being traded 168 hours a week, 672 hrs a month
324 2018-01-07 21:37:45 It improves my game mate...!
325 2018-01-07 21:36:52 ahh yeah. eh i think ft2 is still preferable so i'd like 2 stocks all the same :B
326 2018-01-07 21:36:13 We're finally on twitter! Give us a follow! Automate your stocks AND cryptos! #myautomatedinvestor #HODL or #HOLD
327 2018-01-07 21:35:50 Nice try but the richest 10% of Americans own over 80% of stocks. There is no data showing a booming market creates jobs -none. You help the rich and are terrible at your job.
328 2018-01-07 21:35:14 Thank you mr president. This has been the best 14 months of my investing life. Some months I make more on stocks than my actual job. Thank you
329 2018-01-07 21:35:13 What about the millions that don’t have stocks or bonds? Didn’t help me! I’m still waiting for promised raise/bonus. You didn’t win the popular vote - I believe you lost that by 2 million votes!
330 2018-01-07 21:35:13 10% Americans own all the stocks
331 2018-01-07 21:35:06 F’ing liar! 10 percent of Americans own 80 percent of stocks.
332 2018-01-07 21:34:49 Wait a minute are you saying all, like, Americans don't own  stocks?!? Impossible! Next you'll say, like, everyone didn't get a million bucks from daddy to, like, start a business! #trumplogic
333 2018-01-07 21:34:41 Ok. Foolish venture capital followed by foolish investors in public stocks. I'm not aware of anyone being coerced into buying the Uber IPO, are you?
334 2018-01-07 21:34:24 I wish there stocks trading in bitcoin, so that when buying a stock, one wouldn't be exposed to the bitcoin<->usd exchange risk... 

It's risky enough holding equities. On top of that, now we need to factor in the cryptocurrency risk...
335 2018-01-07 21:34:11 Wall street owns 83% of that 7 trillion in stocks. How does that help average americans?
336 2018-01-07 21:34:07 The MM algos are looking at many variables in the market, reading news and trading patterns in milliseconds, and assessing market sentiment. For expl, if bitcoin sentiment changes, that info will be incorporated into pricing for crypto related stocks also.
337 2018-01-07 21:33:56 You’ll be fine - you have an eye for good stocks
338 2018-01-07 21:33:23 Everybody buying tide pods for the meme is paying for my college. I got stocks in Tide, y’all.
339 2018-01-07 21:33:23 How much was driven by Tech stocks/companies in Silicon Valley? I doubt much of this growth is coal.
340 2018-01-07 21:32:53 Yes...his base does not understand that the stock margins are rising because the rich are buying back their own stocks. This is what led us into the Great Depression.  Tax breaks, but back stocks, and you can hold on to them when things tank. It goes up again you make a fortune.
341 2018-01-07 21:31:35 Omg--nobody is going to be able to buy more $SX shares Monday, because most people won't be able to afford them, reason I have no #apple or #amazon stocks! Just wow!
342 2018-01-07 21:30:56 Uh, did you get a raise, or a bonus this year? Do you own stocks? If so how much has your portfolio increased over the last year? What infrastructure projects have begun over the last year? Oh none? Hmm...
343 2018-01-07 21:30:07 The stock market is not the economy!
A lot of stock shares are held by folks in other countries!  Stocks don't create jobs, demand does! 
What will you do for the people who will be replaced by automation?
344 2018-01-07 21:30:00 The Nikkei finished Friday at the highest weekly closing level seen in the 1364 weeks since 15 November 1991. Last week's rally was the biggest weekly gain seen in the Nikkei in the 77 weeks since 15 July 2016 #stocks
345 2018-01-07 21:29:08 I was not whining. I have a 401k. I'm stating a fact. Most Americans do not own stocks. Most of America is living in poverty or check to check. I get tired of hearing about the stock market as its doing nothing to help normal everyday Americans.
346 2018-01-07 21:29:05 No jobs have not been created by the stocks. Rich are now going to cash in because of the tax break you gift wrapped. The average person will see a dismal amount of pocket change from this, in a few years the middle class will be paying the prudent for this mistake.
347 2018-01-07 21:28:47 Few days ago when I came back from Costco, my dad was like you bought more stuff than the grocer in our village stocks.
348 2018-01-07 21:28:38 Most Americans don't even own stocks.
349 2018-01-07 21:28:16 #BZT #BNR two stocks guaranteed to make people some money this week 
350 2018-01-07 21:28:16 Like 90% of my countrymen, it's done fuck-all for me because I can't afford significant stocks.

We haven't been paid the equivalent of the 1960 minimum wage since 1960. Inflation has destroyed us at the bottom, caused by the interest charges by profit-taking assholes on top.
351 2018-01-07 21:27:33 The stock market doesn’t create jobs, just rents.

2017 was lowest avg monthly job growth since 2011

And only 8% of stocks are owned by the bottom 80% of Americans, who you are are purporting to help.

So you’ve helped make rich people richer while slowing job growth

Well done!
352 2018-01-07 21:27:09 Sell your paintings..your gold.. your bonds and stocks and feed the poor you puppet. You Carolingian
353 2018-01-07 21:26:58 @tastytraderMike Hi Mike, regarding your episode w/@tastytradeRyan , "Stocks vs Options". I've been using stocks with covered calls with 'great' success. Using a mere .5% per month (6% annual) OTM CC. Appreciation +6% has done well. Is there a better OTM strike w/this strategy?
354 2018-01-07 21:26:45 Over 80 percent of the stocks owned by the rich
355 2018-01-07 21:26:13 Hey #asshat #Trump @POTUS The high stocks helps mostly the wealthy and 1%ers like your friends. It doesn't help me at all!
And those jobs you cream yourself about? They're NOT jobs in new & innovative fields...they're just in fast food, warehouse, manufacturing lines -> wealthy
356 2018-01-07 21:26:04 Free money for Wall St. Boosting stock prices, meanwhile interest rates are held at 0% so your savings account is useless. This trends people towards stocks, which pushes the price up further. When that bubble pops, everyone hurts.
357 2018-01-07 21:26:01 Very much agreed mate. I’ll stick to selling beer..! Lol
358 2018-01-07 21:25:37 I’ve been trading stocks and currency on forex for like 6 years now. I do have some cryptos (XRP, IOT, DASH) but if you want to INVEST your money you should get into silver.
359 2018-01-07 21:25:27 Sympa ! C'est facile d'avoir les livres des anciens catalogues sur leur site (en commande) ou leurs stocks sont vite épuisés ??
360 2018-01-07 21:25:19 Liar, there are penny stocks, are there not?
361 2018-01-07 21:25:09 I jumped in $TEUM when it was 1.06 ask me how im doing now ???

362 2018-01-07 21:24:03 Higher stock prices only enrich the 20% of the population that owns 92% of all stocks
363 2018-01-07 21:23:42 But 1% of the population owns 93% of the stocks. So while over half have some investment in stocks,  they don't have enough to create the kind of wealth a market boom makes for the 1%
364 2018-01-07 21:23:26 Does not. And yes he does. It’s called the constitutional method. States vote.  He wins, we win, stocks skyrocket, courts stop making laws and start just judging, factories return. Middle class grows. China, Korea, Middle East respect us. #winning.
365 2018-01-07 21:22:43 Are you talking structured products here or is there a distinction between structured products and structured notes?
366 2018-01-07 21:22:31 True but if you have the discipline to start buying stocks when young you will have a lot when you retire...so you don't have to be rich to enjoy the benefits of rising markets.
367 2018-01-07 21:22:11 With the @buffalobills now out of the playoffs, we’ll see if my decision to short folding table manufacturer stocks pays off. #BillsMafiatable
368 2018-01-07 21:21:18 The DJIA is a rigged system that is designed to rarely go down. When it does, all they do is change what makes up the index to companies that are doing fine. But it really only looks at the stocks on it, not every stock.
369 2018-01-07 21:21:01 Doesn’t help the 60% of us who don’t own stocks. And who knows what it will be like when my 401k
370 2018-01-07 21:20:41 For the few who actually own stocks. Not peer middle or working class.
371 2018-01-07 21:20:26 
Pray for a full blown trade war, so stocks will crash and we can buy low..
372 2018-01-07 21:20:19 Top 10% of ppl own 80% of stocks - so this hardly benefits the majority of Americans! Stop touting this bc most don't benefit - only the wealthy - which we all know are the only ppl you really care about you freaking hypocrite!
373 2018-01-07 21:19:10 They don't know they don't own stocks?
374 2018-01-07 21:19:05 Paper stocks??
375 2018-01-07 21:18:51 Important thread. Per @jonronson’s writing on the topic, Twitter seems to be a lightning rod conducting the anger extant within the community. The two minute hate. Perceived transgressors strapped into the stocks. It could be any one of us on the receiving end.
376 2018-01-07 21:18:39 i bought a load of dogecoin a year ago, and now its paying nicely, lol shows throwing darts sometimes pays, as well as all the darts I threw at weed stocks lol
377 2018-01-07 21:18:30 A majority of stocks are owned by the extremely wealthy. These numbers do relatively nothing for the average American. Plus it's a bubble. Gonna pop thanks to deregulation and reckless risk taking.
378 2018-01-07 21:18:19 Third, stocks give an assessment of how valuable investors think the company is. When stock prices rise, it means investors think earnings will improve. Falling stock prices mean investors have lost confidence in the company's ability to increase its profit margins.
379 2018-01-07 21:18:03 #TotallyFalse
the money is worth far less today than if put into stocks
380 2018-01-07 21:17:57 Second, stocks provide the capital for companies to grow large enough to gain competitive advantage through economies of scale. Owners use personal credit cards, bank loans and eventually even float their own bonds.
381 2018-01-07 21:17:40 similar to the one in cardiff, hopefully just took him out the game as a precaution
382 2018-01-07 21:17:39 Higher stock prices <> jobs and 40+ percent of Americans don’t own stocks...just a reminder
383 2018-01-07 21:17:36 Stocks affect the economy in three critical ways. First, they allow individual investors to own part of a successful company. Without stocks, only large private equity investors could profit from America's free market economy.
384 2018-01-07 21:17:25 Time to sell those folding table manufacturer stocks.
385 2018-01-07 21:17:21 Job growth down under ur watch! 50% of Americans don't own stocks, which probably includes some of ur 32%. SC Mueller & NYAG Schneiderman r close. Obstruction, RICO, money laundering, racketeering, conspiracy. Indictments dropping soon! Who's next Donnie? Resign now! #moron
386 2018-01-07 21:17:09 And yet, half of the country do not possess stocks of any kind.  How does this help them?
387 2018-01-07 21:17:03 US stocks: technical indicators are stretched#Forex
388 2018-01-07 21:16:57 Hey guys lets talk trading.... penny stocks....
389 2018-01-07 21:16:48 Looked in pain as he skated off !! He’s been playing well recently aswell
390 2018-01-07 21:16:17 It’s scary the weight of power his tweets carry.
He’s spoken out against companies causing their stocks to drop.
391 2018-01-07 21:15:24 Called in “sell” on folding table stocks.
392 2018-01-07 21:15:17 Average Americans don’t own stocks.
393 2018-01-07 21:14:42 Well if he signals to the Fed he wants to pump up stocks.
394 2018-01-07 21:14:37 If I had stocks that would be great. What I need is higher interest rates at my bank for the little money I have. I need my employer to pay a living wage. That's what most ppl I know want.
395 2018-01-07 21:14:32 Hopefully @Stocks_68 is not too hurt and can manage the belfast game!
396 2018-01-07 21:14:23 What does $GROW do? #bitcoin #blockchain #stocks
397 2018-01-07 21:13:49 All of this money is going to the top 0.1% - 50% of Americans and the vast majority of your base do not own stocks. These dollars are going to those who you gave tax breaks and they are not going to share the wealth. You have done nothing for those who need you
398 2018-01-07 21:13:15 Show the Dow not s and p...lol.  and that's after their full terms right? Not just barely one year.  Research a little more even msm is reporting the yuge gains.  Did you sell all your stocks?
399 2018-01-07 21:11:38 that's funny! I lost my healthcare! Trump overturned all Obamas policies that's why stocks are at record high! Wake the f up
400 2018-01-07 21:10:52 TD direct allow buying #ffwd. Also allow international stocks to be traded in case u like to buy some #nuu!!
401 2018-01-07 21:09:59 Corporations are only in it to increase the price of stocks for their shareholders. One way they can do that is by keeping labor costs down.
402 2018-01-07 21:09:44 7 trillion dollars into the pockets of those who are wealthy enough to invest in the stock market and own companies in the stock exchange. Not everyone owns stocks.
403 2018-01-07 21:09:37 really 1.7 million jobs tax cuts just gave billions in christmas bonus pay to lower and middle class companys gave a pay raise of 3 to 6 a hour companys spending billions in the us stock market and 401 ks everybody that has stocks or 401 k is killing it trump is a rock star
404 2018-01-07 21:09:29 It's hilarious how you think you are responsible for the booming stocks
405 2018-01-07 21:09:23 For those who have stocks.  For those who don't. What do they get?
406 2018-01-07 21:09:18 How can we trust analysts valuing stocks using intrinsic DCF valuations when in fact the single most important number in most of their valuations, the terminal value, is derived by using a multiple (ie a relative valuation)?
407 2018-01-07 21:09:14 i agree w this sentiment but also think 3on teams is sick as a variation to normal crews.

also curious, why not do current crew style? feels like you could just have a lot of front heavy crews this way no?

lastly normal crews i enjoy but 4 stocks is "too stable" lol
408 2018-01-07 21:09:11 He’s not the only one. The first world sees of him is in the England shirt...how crazy is that.  Modern players are hiding in youth teams then finding themselves in league two feeling sorry for themselves
409 2018-01-07 21:09:08 I made some research about those stocks $RTM $AAZ and $LOTO

Imo they will be good money to make just check the coming weeks
410 2018-01-07 21:08:41 I worked in factories. Stephen Miller and his boss are no friends of factory workers no matter what crap they say. “LOOK -STOCKS ARE UP!!!
411 2018-01-07 21:08:32 On top of that, too many people think of outplaying as winning neutral more or getting a percent lead. But if someone keeps dying at 75 to a rage character at 150, they're getting outplayed. Finding ways to finish stocks matters more.
412 2018-01-07 21:08:29 what are stocks? do they moon? lmao... 
413 2018-01-07 21:07:55 Please get an education. Rising stocks DOES NOT MEAN MORE JOBS!
414 2018-01-07 21:07:40 Yet again not so smart guy you still don't get it jobs increasing and stocks doing great doesn't mean anything because our increasing national debt is out of control and you're to dum to see that
415 2018-01-07 21:07:40 .@POTUS Too bad most of you base don't own stocks! Your just helping you rich friends get wealthier! Just like your #TAXSCAM! Bad! Sad! Resign Liar-In-Chief!
416 2018-01-07 21:07:33 Its not real money, can't spend it, feed your family, provide shelter, or clothes with stocks. They have no true value
417 2018-01-07 21:07:21 Only for the wealthy that can afford stocks. Majority of people cannot afford stocks. #ImpeachTrump
418 2018-01-07 21:07:20 Only about 1/2 of Americans own stock. You seem to think rising stocks benefit everybody, but they don't. How dumb ARE you? And why do you keep randomly capitalizing words?
419 2018-01-07 21:07:17 Your base don’t own stocks only you and your rich buddies will benefit from tax reform. Your base will remain in low paying jobs
420 2018-01-07 21:06:27 That’s the problem with all the money mate. This is Loftus-Cheek’s first proper season of full time regular football in the Premier yeah he’s been on 60k a week at Chelsea for 3 years! Not a bad gig if you can get it!!
421 2018-01-07 21:06:22 Too bad half of Americans can’t afford to buy stocks because of low wage jobs and/or high health insurance costs/co pays. Economy is booming for the rich corporations who will not share it with their workers
422 2018-01-07 21:06:12 At #LFWM and a model? Don’t forget tomorrow’s the last day to pick up a goodie bag - get there while stocks last lads. The Model Zone is your destination!
423 2018-01-07 21:05:45 Thank you so much for the increased value of our stocks!
424 2018-01-07 21:05:43 I will say this, @BigBirdofBayst provides newbies like myself an easy way to see which penny stocks are in play and somewhat hot plays.  from what I’ve seen the past 1.5 years, lots of pumpers out there... do your DD like you’re running your own biz regardless of what any1 says
425 2018-01-07 21:05:08 Have to agree the wealthy are getting wealthier. To bad most Americans don’t own stocks. So they’ll have to wait for the Trickle down BS
426 2018-01-07 21:04:52 The majority of stocks are held by the wealthy and big corporations you bungling idiot!!

427 2018-01-07 21:04:39 80% of the stocks are owned by 20% of the population.
When trump tweets about the market, he’s not talking to the average working citizens that he pretends to represent.
428 2018-01-07 21:04:38 Agreed. We have produced so many players of the years. They can’t wait to leave first team football and progression behind to sit on a bench, Lewis cook is a World Cup winner and it took him far to long to break into Bournemouth’s team,crazy

431 2018-01-07 21:04:06 Still room for more of an exodus from bonds to stocks...
432 2018-01-07 21:03:28 You keep pushing that crap of the Stock Market? Most of Americans don't have the money to afford buying stocks. You're  preaching to your millionare friends and not the average American.
433 2018-01-07 21:03:25 Stock market is for rich to make them richer. I don't own stocks ,no one I know does. Tell US how YOU ,personally ,have profited.
434 2018-01-07 21:02:52 Thank God for Our President Trump! You are incredible Sir! You are making Americans Rich literally! I wish I both some stocks minute you Be came President! I be rich by now! 
435 2018-01-07 21:02:33 Which raises the question, with what we need to compare the volume, to get to the conclusion that it is small/big/whatever.
FX? Stocks? 

Also, it is not possible to trust the volume, when the exchanges are not audited.
436 2018-01-07 21:01:56 You mean if he had invested it in safe stocks, but it's the same principle.

Tulips 1634
South Sea Company 1719
The Nikkei 1984
Dot-com stocks 1997
US housing 2006
Bitcoin 2017

Beware promises of outlandish returns with no risk or suffer the consequences.
438 2018-01-07 21:01:48 A strong market benefits any American with investments, no matter how small. Including working class folks with 401k accounts. What do think those 401K are invested in? Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
439 2018-01-07 21:01:47 I would again remind you that only 14 percent of Americans own individual stocks and that half of America doesn’t have any money invested in the stock market at all. One wonders if this “president” is in touch with the day to day economic struggles of average Americans.
440 2018-01-07 21:01:16 Buy Canadian whiskey stocks.
441 2018-01-07 21:01:09 Stocks performed better in Obama’s first year though
442 2018-01-07 21:00:46 @thehill Quit bragging about stock market so much! Started going up under Obama. Only 20% of Americans or less own stock! So majority of Americans see no benefits from rising stocks as big companies use their profits for shareholders & stock buy backs.
443 2018-01-07 21:00:26 All over the world stocks are doing great. Do you think Trump is responsible for that?
444 2018-01-07 21:00:21 And honestly, being ostracised IS a punishment, & the only one he's gotten so far, since YT is coddling him. Being insulted via the internet is the modern day equvilent to being put in stocks so passersby can throw tomatoes at you. This is nothing new.
445 2018-01-07 21:00:15 For those of your supporters that can't afford to invest into stocks it means nothing. As for jobs..........I see jobs leaving my state, not coming into our state
446 2018-01-07 21:00:06 Thanks Donald, my stock portfolio is doing great, but it was also doing great under Obama. Do you think your base has a lot of their extra money tied up in stocks and bonds?
447 2018-01-07 21:00:04 As Brendan Gleason said in the movie The Guard: I don't know where you're buying your stocks but mine are not doing so well. (Gleason said "cocaine," not "stocks.")
448 2018-01-07 20:59:54 Jobs and stocks CONTINUE to increase as they did under Obama, and for the record, at a lower percent growth now than in 2016. So this doesn't qualify you as a stable genius - in fact you are neither.
449 2018-01-07 20:59:19 Should have clarified, those are all stocks I will own Monday at open. I’ll be watching $FAT for sure and may do some mid-day buying depending on how the morning swings

453 2018-01-07 20:58:55 And half Americans don't even own stocks.
454 2018-01-07 20:58:50 Bubble bubble bubble! Plus half of Americans are unaffected by stocks. Plus, this is still Obama's wave. I thought you were supposed to be like, really smart. Totally.
455 2018-01-07 20:57:59 What does the stock market do for coal miners and people working several part time jobs with little pay and no benefits? You do understand that you and your wealthy buddies stocks gains don't help working people put food o  the table, right?

457 2018-01-07 20:57:16 Only 10 percent of Americans invest in gambling Stocks on Wall Street. It benefits the Stockholders; CEO's;  upper management of private, for profit Corporations. What goes up Comes Down too.
458 2018-01-07 20:56:56 Only a small percentage of people have money in the market, though many in the middle class have stocks in their 401K. This does not lead to jobs, but more than anything, helps the rich.
459 2018-01-07 20:56:22 You do know the forgotten man and woman does not own any stocks right??

465 2018-01-07 20:55:16 148,000 jobs created in December even with the high stock market. Not everyone has stocks. Think that the people benefitting are the rich.
466 2018-01-07 20:55:08 My kids has no stocks.
467 2018-01-07 20:54:53 Yeah but if you don’t have stocks or money to afford the what do people care about the Market
468 2018-01-07 20:54:30 Day 352: Trump again takes to Twitter to promote his fantasy award show. Also touts the 25k DOW close. Worth noting is that the top 10% richest own more than 80% of the stocks. Meanwhile, in Baltimore, parents have to raise extra money to keep public schools heated. #resist
469 2018-01-07 20:54:29 You do know that 95% of your supporters don't own stocks and bonds, don't you? Nah, the stock market gains aren't benefitting them.
470 2018-01-07 20:54:06 #fakenews record setting stocks then, too, if you think record setting stocks is a good measure of community prosperity, which I don't. it doesn't measure the health of main street
471 2018-01-07 20:54:05 As stocks went up in the past decade, no one has gotten a raise, no jobs have been created outside the normal flow other than a spike around 2012, and as it simmers down, jobs will be lost, pay will be cut, and robots will take over.
472 2018-01-07 20:53:50 BO's stock market gains were realized by printing money and by Fed artificially keeping interest rates at zero.

474 2018-01-07 20:53:22 The majority of Americans have no stocks.
475 2018-01-07 20:53:07 Let me check how much I made. I have.
 Nope none I have bills and check stubs but no stocks.
476 2018-01-07 20:52:34 Richest 10% of Americans now own 84% of all stocks. Tell me again why average people should care that the Dow hit 25,000? #MAGA
477 2018-01-07 20:52:22 Got some stocks that are doing well rn!
478 2018-01-07 20:51:56 The 50% that can't afford stocks aren't feeling your "tremendous benefits"  Very poor jobs report isn't hopeful for them either.   How about being their President.
479 2018-01-07 20:51:39 Th Dow is like an investment club that meets every day to pump and dump stocks.
10% of The people own 80% of the stocks and move the prices for their own benefit.  Just wait till they start dumping.
480 2018-01-07 20:51:38 The stock market has nothing to do with jobs creation. Less than a quarter of Americans hold stocks. You are bragging about lining the pockets of your rich friends, not helping the average American. Sad! #delusionaldonny
481 2018-01-07 20:51:34 90% of all stocks are owned by the most wealthy 10%. This is good news for people with money, does very little for everyone else.
482 2018-01-07 20:50:53 Sir, if i might not interupt. Initity could emulate individuals.
There would be enough void in the gap.

And end preempt.

483 2018-01-07 20:50:51 Got the rundown and I feel so much more educated now on 401k, life insurances, stocks and bonds etc. that I feel confident enough to start my retirement plan like TODAY.
484 2018-01-07 20:50:42 Factoid. No money is made if stocks go up.

I have $1,000. You have $1,000 + a share. You sell to me for $100. I have $900 + share, you have $1,100

Stock doubles. I sell it back for $200.

I have $1,100. You have $900 +share.

Total always $2,000

Money moved, not made, Mr Trump
485 2018-01-07 20:50:14 85% of stocks are owned by the top 10% of the country’s wealthiest people. Your base pretends to care about the stock market because you lie to them about its effects on the economy.
486 2018-01-07 20:50:10 For rich people with stocks - the  rest of us, not so much
487 2018-01-07 20:49:28 For the wealthy who invest in stocks

490 2018-01-07 20:48:54 The stock market does NOT benefit the average American who cannot afford to gamble with their money (or even afford to purchase stocks), and is NO MEASURE OF AMERICAN ECONOMY.  Didn't you know that, oh Stable Genius???
491 2018-01-07 20:48:52 80% of Americans do not own stocks, so how does the stock market help middle class Americans?.... it doesn't.... like your tax scam.
492 2018-01-07 20:48:22 U don't know anyone that doesn't have stocks do u? Not sure what jobs u think are being created by the stock market. Just going to be  more and more corporate takeovers and massive CEO bonuses. But, your base will believe whatever buffoonery u put out there.
493 2018-01-07 20:48:19 I don't own stocks.
494 2018-01-07 20:48:02 You have no idea how any of it works though. The stock market is not a reflection of the economy for the majority of people because most people don't own stocks or they only own very minute shares which means they don't really make anything off the stock market.
495 2018-01-07 20:48:01 You do know most Americans don’t own stocks (besides their 401k’s(those lucky enough to have one)) right?
496 2018-01-07 20:48:00 I don’t believe the stock market affects jobs all that much. But it def does make the rich richer as most stocks are owned by the top 20%.
497 2018-01-07 20:47:52 Seriously some politicians are laughing stocks
498 2018-01-07 20:47:45 There was nothing in the tax cuts for the wealthy bill requiring the white wealthy elites & corporations to invest all of their tax gains in research, development or jobs. They're using the $$ to buy back their own stocks. Meanwhile, AT&T is laying off thousands of employees.

502 2018-01-07 20:47:30 Most Americans don’t own stocks Donny. But thanks for reminding us how Obama’s economic policies invigorating economic policies are still driving America!
503 2018-01-07 20:47:18 many many dresses now only half price. But hurry while stocks last ...sale continues for one more week at Raspberry Red
504 2018-01-07 20:47:11 Wrong, it's only benefited corporations and those who have stocks. Everyone else is still in the same boat, getting nothing but screwed. You and the GOP could care less.
505 2018-01-07 20:47:00 A small percentage of Americans own a majority of stocks. The rich get richer.
506 2018-01-07 20:46:26 90% of all stocks are owned by the top 10% in america. The only thing you are accomplishing is to make your rich friends even richer, and admitted as much over the holidays at mar-a-lago. This is not creating jobs or wage raises.
507 2018-01-07 20:46:03 It's wrong to capitalize the words stock market. The stock market does nothing for the U.S.--it's solely an indicator of wealth for white elites & corporations. Corporations are currently using their tax gains to buy back their stocks at inflated prices to increase their wealth.
508 2018-01-07 20:45:45 Economists are never scientific about their predictions. All na assumption. 
Recall the hype about the stocks few years ago until the bubble busted.
The forecast was on radio every morning suddenly the anchor man, name withheld, vanished.
Magicians are better than them.
509 2018-01-07 20:45:44 Curious.. who benefits from stock buybacks on overvalued (imo) stocks?
510 2018-01-07 20:45:43 That's actually not true. Most Americans do not own stocks(less than 40%. most owned by the top 10%) If you are fortunate enough to have a 401k (34% of ppl) then you aren't pulling money out until you retire. How many ppl lost their 401ks during the recession? Wages are stagnant.
511 2018-01-07 20:45:26  I mean seriously, what kind of drugs are you on man? Do you know anything about how stocks work!? It’s called algorithms you idiot, not who won the election !
512 2018-01-07 20:45:17 Problem is only the wealthy can afford stocks  making it less of an economic indicator. But thank you Obama for transitioning a strong economy
513 2018-01-07 20:45:09 Can you tell the SEC to investigate naked shorting of stocks?
514 2018-01-07 20:45:09 Yeah those Red State voters own a TON of stocks! Moron!
515 2018-01-07 20:45:01 I DONT HAVE STOCKS.
I AM THE AMERICAN WHO DOESN'T HAVE THE EXTRA $$ TO PUT IN STOCKS.

518 2018-01-07 20:44:38 How many of your poorly educated worshippers actually own stocks?
519 2018-01-07 20:44:36 Great news for the wealthy. 80% of America has no stocks, 401K or retirement. What have you accomplished for them?
520 2018-01-07 20:44:27 NO benefits for me, I only  handful of stocks - so if I make $74 or $90 it just means I pay more in taxes.
521 2018-01-07 20:44:22 Stocks was very very limited
522 2018-01-07 20:44:20 *Only 1/4 people own stocks.
523 2018-01-07 20:44:19 Not for the country. People who own stocks in the market. Like the top 1%!
524 2018-01-07 20:44:11 You don't know the difference between stocks and wages,  climate and weather. 
Why? Because you're a moron.
525 2018-01-07 20:44:08 The stock market is rising because companies are buying back their own stocks. Trickle down economics does not work, the stock market does not represent the average working Americans wealth!
526 2018-01-07 20:44:05 Again, you petulant twit, it’s only real value when people start selling off the stocks. And then it becomes a declining market. Be sure to take credit for that too.

531 2018-01-07 20:43:39 Stocks have nothing to do with jobs. A huge amount of that profit is going to foreign investors, dickhead.
532 2018-01-07 20:43:29 @kurteichenwald Tentacle porn?? Typical proggy weirdo.
Also, you told people to sell their stocks, not to reallocate to the EAFE...liar too I see. European stocks have been a good place due the ECB printing presses which lagged the US fed doing the same years before.
533 2018-01-07 20:42:53 Trump likes to take credit for Wall Street's gains, but in truth Global Growth 
buoyed our market.

In 2027 U.S.stocks returned 21.19%;
Europe rose 25.51%  &   
the Emerging Market index climbed over 37% 

China alone jumped 54.07%.

When other economies grow, we all benefit.

According to your logic, trading Stocks / Cryptos relies only on pure luck to win just like gambling.

Well, actually before investing, investors should do a lot of research before committing their money. It's common sense.

609 2018-01-07 19:49:41 Yes, people who live their lives to make money, make money. Most of us don’t buy stocks because we simply aren’t that interested in getting rich. Just want a comfortable life and some free time. I don’t care if the rich are rich as long as I am not destitute.

638 2018-01-07 19:33:14 The case with Intel CPUs shows again how weird the corporate system is. The CEO has sold his stocks last year, most probably knowing what was going to happen. Intel's behavior doesn't exhibit traits of acknowledging the issue and willing to fix it, but rather protective.

654 2018-01-07 19:25:44 Are you still diluting fella or what is happening other crypto stocks are flying and yours is lagging. What's going? 
655 2018-01-07 19:23:54 Do stocks mean US stocks or US+nonUS combined?
656 2018-01-07 19:23:52 @sainsburys Can I find the Sainsbury's BBQ Pulled Jackfruit at your Hertford store and if not, where is the closest store to Hertford that stocks it? :)
657 2018-01-07 19:23:44 (2/2) I think guidance will be a shock as projected EPS % growth on some stocks will decelerate rapidly. Sales growth may save them...
658 2018-01-07 19:23:00 Hola @albert_dmcat A aquest país no tindría efectes una vaga a la "japonesa". Al Japó funcionen aquestes vagues, per que les empreses són verticals, i treballen sense stocks (Just in time). Si treballen més, es produeixen stocks, i això els fa perdre diners. Més o menys és això.
659 2018-01-07 19:22:10 It is all about money to dirty GOP.   probably have money in the stocks with these companies.
660 2018-01-07 19:21:48 More than half of citizens have no stocks or 401k's.
661 2018-01-07 19:20:02 The only existing evidence that President Trump is "crazy" is that he was willing to give up an amazing, fantastic life in order for him and his family to be bombarded 24/7 by vile assholes who aren't fit to even lick his boot

663 2018-01-07 19:18:36 The government and Parliamentary representatives of this area and all other such areas in the country must be held responsible for the lives of these people, live stocks and properties. Someone is accountable; time to bring them to book.

665 2018-01-07 19:17:05 Hope all you haters sold off your stocks when our president took office.  Keep making America great President Trump!
666 2018-01-07 19:17:04 Almost all teacher, public employee, govt employee pension plan is in stocks. Lots still benefit.
667 2018-01-07 19:15:51 But I like this concept of pointing to someone else for a stupid idea... “it may sound crazy to sell out of stocks when sales of water increase more than soda, but a Michael Batnick side bar in a Research Affiliates post from 2011 made it clear this was true”

677 2018-01-07 19:10:43 It’s already happening if you can see beyond all that eye makeup!  Companies laying off, buying stocks back, staying overseas as counties lower their corporate tax rates & wages remaining stagnant!
678 2018-01-07 19:10:10 I was lucky, because I was able to jump back on my feet trading penny stocks, but most of my losses were due to following alert inside chatrooms. These guys will cash out before u do, therefore by the time ur out, ur also out w/ a big loss. #PennyStocksScam
679 2018-01-07 19:09:25 @Kwqs so to change my thinking about crypto is to not try to apply the same reasons for value as stocks. They are different.
680 2018-01-07 19:09:23 I will get some stocks just for you 
681 2018-01-07 19:08:42 Trading stocks, PennyStocks specifically R risky, especially when U have chatrooms loaded w/ members 1k plus such as #TimSykes u will lose at the end. B smart, do ur homework b4 joining such a modern scam.
682 2018-01-07 19:08:36 @Kwqs thanks, I understand more in just the few characters. I have more information to research now. I’ve trade stocks and options s/ 2004
683 2018-01-07 19:08:34 stocks already take up so much of my time (I’m going to DM you an algorithm) now crypto is now infringing upon meh 
684 2018-01-07 19:08:02 I'm continuing to hold GFI as a tech stock pick for 2018 but things can change fast. Only way to view gold stocks is technically in my view - gold price looks promising. It just has to be watched constantly.

686 2018-01-07 19:07:20 Gif boy said he sold all his stocks last November and has been in cash ever since. Tweeted that Trump victory would result in market crash. Also admits he’s a dumbass. Now lies about it. It’s very amusing.
687 2018-01-07 19:07:14 oh melee commentators "one stock is not a lead. 2 stocks to 1 he has the lead, but in melee anything can happen."

can y'all not contradict yourself in literally the next sentence?
688 2018-01-07 19:05:32 What does this have to do with his point?  Stocks are not a smart way to measure the economy which hired less people in 17 than 16. Stocks can go right back down on anything the markets get scared of. Fact.
689 2018-01-07 19:05:09 Dabbling with some disposable income. Not a gambler and never done stocks before, but it’s quite fun!

696 2018-01-07 19:00:41 My accountant sed everyone in finance was expecting the burst this past summer—Stocks dropping 20%. It WILL happen and you could be on target.  Look at Exxon. Stocks overinflated—not enuf free flow cash to cover debt.  Same with lots of other Corps.

702 2018-01-07 18:59:11 GDP-OBAMAS-trump enacted 0 legislatively to effect this.
Stock market-been going up, the only thing 45 did was give tax-cuts to the 1%-10% who own 84% of all stocks, so they can invest/make more $.
Unemployment-
45’s #’s are lower than they have been since 2011.
703 2018-01-07 18:58:53 Yes, as we just witnessed  recently, the stocks are very fickle when it comes to news reports whether true or not. As far as job numbers, I guess it's a wait-and-see at this point whether the tax cuts have any impact.
704 2018-01-07 18:56:48 Simply put: "Bitcoin is determined by what people will pay for it. In this way, there's a similarity to how stocks are priced". Story Above it's like a concept for a story, until you own it or create it, there is no story and people will pay (a lot or little) to have it.

708 2018-01-07 18:52:26 More specifically he says he wants to shag her. He also says hateful thing about disabled people, women and gay people. @toadmeister is not fit for any public role apart from perhaps being put in the stocks.

744 2018-01-07 18:27:24 No. My personal experience is timing doesn't work. Time you stayed with quality stocks is key to long term, stable returns.
745 2018-01-07 18:26:40 The majority of middle class do not invest in stocks/stock market.
It's an indicator of how well these top 30 are doing, and an indicator of the rising dividends of their stocks. Big woo. And does not guarantee employment stimulation. Phooey.
746 2018-01-07 18:24:16 So stock market newbie? DOs and DONTs. DO regular, LT diversified investments with low fees... DONTs.. Trading, big bets, hot tips, timing, Option gyms.. you’ll lose and give up stocks  forever

756 2018-01-07 18:17:20 Yes, but low bond rates are the foundation for the extreme pricing in everything including stocks, bonds, art, cryptos, real estate, etc.  If you are worried about bonds, you should be worried about all asset prices.
757 2018-01-07 18:17:09 People must save more when rates are low. Signals more dis-inflation. Rates continue to stay low. FED knows this. Buy stocks Invest globally

771 2018-01-07 18:02:20 Imagine working at an Investment House and you continually bought stocks that depreciated in value, hired and remained loyal to staff that were nowhere near as good as competitors and passed on poaching the best staff on case it hindered said staffs growth...

775 2018-01-07 17:57:46 more to the point; until tax bill, DJT didn't enacted 1 pc of legislation that had effect on market and is still functioning on last Obama budget. Moreover, 35% of US stocks are held by foreigners. Of the remainder, ~ 80% are held by 10% of ppl, mostly white, so #magamyass

778 2018-01-07 17:56:26 Some stocks can be and stay cheap for a long time. One needs also to identify catalysts that would unlock value : buyback or special divi.

786 2018-01-07 17:53:10 Yeah that's not a good argument, since the S&P 500 is also doing well.  But to your point, unless someone has money to own stocks, it doesn't help them.
787 2018-01-07 17:52:18 U.S. fund managers expect value stocks to jump in 2018...
788 2018-01-07 17:52:13 Don't buy stocks today!
789 2018-01-07 17:52:12 The overall state of this nation when it comes to jobs, defense, stocks, and business has substantially improved under Trump in just one year. Why would anybody want to impeach him? This is a desperate act by democrats in fear of becoming inconsequential.
790 2018-01-07 17:52:11 I wonder if someone comes ahead of him and stocks the pond with hungry fish so he can catch them like a big boy. Like his canned safari hunts.

792 2018-01-07 17:51:16 Duh. No. It’s Straw Man crap. Are you saying there should be random room inspections, at hotels? This is pointless. Now, answer my question: Why do we need bump stocks or 100 magazine clips?  Should we be allowed grenade launchers?
793 2018-01-07 17:50:57 Stocks all time high due to a global growth including Europe. Who is right?
794 2018-01-07 17:50:33 How many times do you need to be told that 53% of Americans own no stocks, and the stock market boom has zero effect on them?
795 2018-01-07 17:50:21 50% of Americans do not have stocks or retirement accounts.  Those people are not benefiting from this so-called liftoff.  No matter how many times you lie, it doesn't make the statements true.  How will u look your kids in their eyes when they confront u about ur time at the WH?

797 2018-01-07 17:49:08 @IvankaTrump  2016 had 200,000 more than jobs created . Dow good,  savings tied to stocks, around 41% of the of workers, the rest not so.
798 2018-01-07 17:48:08 America, RR, VI, and All Territories need  health Coverage womb to tomb. We need to buy stocks in  and solar energy chains of deliveries. We need to PRIORITIZE EDUCATION. All of the above will work with a younger OR older workforce.
799 2018-01-07 17:47:41 You are crazy! Economy was no where near what is is today. I lost a few thousand dollars under Obama.  Under Trump, my stocks made@all@that up plus 11 thousand under Trump.

806 2018-01-07 17:43:10 Under Obama: "stock market means nothing. Unemployment figures are a lie!"

Under Trump: "look at the stocks because of the president! Unemployment figures are now real."

You can't even see your own bias.

834 2018-01-07 17:28:52 There are these things called stocks I’d invest my money in first lol
835 2018-01-07 17:28:44 top 10% of the wealthiest own ~80% of all stocks (fact). Might help explain why the Dow is exploding and middle class wages remain stagnant.
836 2018-01-07 17:27:35 I take it that like stocks/housing, it's the bond market in general, though a correction may drag down "sound" bonds & bond funds as well?
837 2018-01-07 17:27:00 I'm just curious.. How many players improve greatly from their Junior to senior year in college? Don't know the answer..I was just under the impression that most players' stocks fall the longer they're in school, the more they get dissected, etc.

846 2018-01-07 17:20:59 I get your point but is your portfolio up 40% over six months or around 80% annualized? I trade and actively invest so I know it's possible in stocks, but I also know how much activity it takes.
847 2018-01-07 17:19:33 I want to because I love competitions however my trading involves both options, stocks, etf, currency across multiple different brokers and I only take 4-5 trades a month so I am not quite sure

853 2018-01-07 17:18:07 Fair points on those bubbles bursting (stocks/housing). So what's the bubble here? What's over-valued?
854 2018-01-07 17:17:53 half of america doesnt own stocks???? Try 90% chum. and e3ven that is ludicrous with the 1% owning everyone, everything and dictating that society must be harsh so the  same top 1% have all the wealth.
855 2018-01-07 17:17:13 When you purchased stocks at 2.08 each and now it’s worth 4.30. Glad bag buss 
856 2018-01-07 17:16:58 They were all Canadian dividend stocks. Now my portfolio is 20-25% VCN and 75-80% VXC. I get the diversification issue but VCN has 212 stocks and costs 0.06% MER.
857 2018-01-07 17:15:19 not sure which part, so here goes...
cyclicals = stocks/sectors that tend to do well during an economic upcycle (and bad during a downturn)
defensives = stocks/sectors that tend to just plod along regardless
858 2018-01-07 17:14:44 What ya think about gold and/or silver mining stocks? Think they'll come rip roaring back? Of course, personally holding physical gold and silver is top priority.

Corporations were banking billions & not giving to the people, now they'll make even more to bank & buy back stocks.
868 2018-01-07 17:07:47 The last car I bought, I paid cash.  Most likely a significantly higher percentage of cash than I would have had the feds not instituted a "Cash For Clunkers" law.  Are stocks more valuable today than a year ago?  Not sure the $ is the best way to judge that.

883 2018-01-07 16:55:27 However, diversifying your risk also diversifies away your return. A seasoned analyst should be able to identify quality value stocks. Better to be net long on good stocks while shorting poor performers.

885 2018-01-07 16:54:52 Absurd to posit plagiarism. The intrinsic value objection is common. Author's views are uniquely expressed: Intrinsic value is a floor. Financial assets e.g. stocks, bonds, cash have intrinsic value? I disagree completely, but see no sign of plagiarism.

the value comes from the fact that you can sell it
905 2018-01-07 16:46:33 Plus, when the Dow rose during the previous administration, it coincided with that administration's efforts to improve the circumstances of those who don't own stocks or benefit directly from the market's rise.

928 2018-01-07 16:33:16 I think Jimmy is looking at the bigger long term picture. I agree Bits maybe confusing to new users, but be realistic. Cents or bits are the easiest thing for everyone to understand. Why do you think we still have pennies? Why do stocks now priced in 4 decimals?
929 2018-01-07 16:33:03 @DJTrump45 love trump. stock mkt great my only hope at 51 yrs old is my 401k stocks
930 2018-01-07 16:32:58 LOL, we were recommending Ripple at $1 a few weeks back. We focus on research and individual stocks mostly, but nothing wrong with some diversification of cash allocations we think either.
931 2018-01-07 16:32:25 "the Dow fell more than 350 points. Stocks largely recovered later in the day." Tell the whole truth! RESIGN!!
932 2018-01-07 16:30:14 Ok right I have 10 stocks that I bought at 5 dollars each. I payed $50 the stock rises to 10 dollars a share I sell and make the difference, same gose with crypto  currency. Let's say 1 bc= 2 USD and layer it gose up to 1 bc =5 USD you sell and make money
933 2018-01-07 16:30:02 Stocks are NOT over price at low interest rates, the question is rising rates at the FEDs speed can take at least 5 more hikes until couse a small hiccup IMO.
934 2018-01-07 16:29:17 Mine is great. So are my stocks, I’m well diversified. But, they did excellent under Obama. I’m going to start investing in property soon, the market is about to head downward so...

945 2018-01-07 16:22:58 Trump & America had a great year! Lowest unemployment numbers in decades, for blacks & whites, new manufacturing jobs &  IT jobs, ISIS territory cut 80%, veterans are getting medical care, military got pay raises, SS benefits increased, biggest tax cut in decades, stocks up, etc.
946 2018-01-07 16:22:08 I use finviz eod & several custom scans I created using @TradeIdeas1 intraday..my basis for long setups is price>8>20>50sma, which delivers me strong stocks, & then opposite for shorts

949 2018-01-07 16:19:57 A legislative order to pass a portion of those savings directly to employees which would have ensured a middle class benefit.  That was shot down. What corporations will do is stock buy backs to drive the value of their stocks then buy out competition with mergers

965 2018-01-07 16:13:30 Ok, but the expression “get your money off the table” implies the the problem isn’t with currency, it’s with stocks. I do not agree, if that’s the implication. Equity is the best place to be long term during these shenanigans.
966 2018-01-07 16:11:22 It’s 3.5 hours to Norway, a NATO country, during which I can sell of my remaining stocks and transfer them to my account in ScotiaBank. That is the only prepping plan I have that includes cyrillics of any kind.

992 2018-01-07 15:51:03 In what world do you believe the CB’s would allow extended deflation? ‘08 changed everything. For example, post Brexit the pound crashed -10%, FTSE -6%. What did the BOE do? It devalued its currency MORE. Why? Because CBs only care about stocks which hold up elites and pensions.

1001 2018-01-07 15:44:48 Thanks. Excellent points. I tallied flows ex FoFs so the increment via bal’d funds you’re referring to wld apply to those that have been in net inflow and invest directly in stocks and bonds. Point about broadening of allocations to alts is otm as well.
1002 2018-01-07 15:43:46 What do you guys think about investing into Marijuana stocks?
1003 2018-01-07 15:42:57 I fear thar $FCAU may have been the best investing idea of the decade and that I may not get such an idea ever again. (There are many stocks that double but very few of them do so predictably and with such large margin of safety.) Should have bet harder...

So it goes...

1022 2018-01-07 15:31:49 Clearly you are misinformed...I’ve been here 60 years as well and started working full time at age 19. Not called a 401K at that time, I put $2.76 week into my account (part stocks). It called smart planning and most companies offer it now.
1023 2018-01-07 15:31:43 Anyone with a finance degree can couple buy what you know with fundamentals.  The real trick is to buy and hold your stocks that you have conviction for.

1025 2018-01-07 15:30:05 1) You do know that stocks also LOSE value, don't you?

1026 2018-01-07 15:30:03 By the way, the positive Dow Jones trend is only indicative of the fact that corporations and the richest stock holders are doing well. The majority of people don't own stocks...

1030 2018-01-07 15:27:33 The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 220.74 points to close at 25,295.87. The S&P 500 climbed 0.7 percent and finished at 2,743.15, with tech stocks rising 1.2 percent.  
The U.S. economy added 148,000 jobs in December, according to the Labor Department.
1031 2018-01-07 15:27:16 You misguide your constituents.  The complexity of the code does not lie in itemized deductions.    If only a few stocks have been bought and sold there are many many forms to fill out. If self-employed at all you have a lot of forms: SS, sch c, such d.  There is no postcard
1032 2018-01-07 15:27:10 'a small loan'? this is the ignorance that elects Trump. fyi: he was born w/ a platinum spoon in his mouth, raised in the business & had the glide path carved out with his father's connects. he then inherited $$$ that could be worth his current net worth if he invested in stocks
1033 2018-01-07 15:26:46 To make money, you have hold a position with conviction. It is hard to do so when you are following someone else

1035 2018-01-07 15:26:10 With CES, NVDA and many tech stocks should reach new ATH this week. Then little cool down next week? After having a great week, I am trying to predict the market now. lol
1036 2018-01-07 15:24:05 It is prudent to focus on stocks wit dividend growth potential. Allocating money to dividend Aristocrats is a smart move.
1037 2018-01-07 15:23:26 Recommend you read GMO,  latest letter,  echoes same sentiment.  Says US is toppish, but in the same vein recommends loading up on EM stocks... On that size objectives are different as well I guess..
1038 2018-01-07 15:22:46 @markminervini when stocks or indices surge through upper channel ranges, like $NYA on weekly, does that signify a coming pullback back into the range, or does that signify a very healthy, strong market? Thanks in advance

1043 2018-01-07 15:20:38 It's funny because it's no different than people who make the same mistake with traditional public stocks, but for some reason, many still don't understand. le sigh..
1044 2018-01-07 15:20:31 @jeffsessions You should buy Pot stocks! You could do what ever you want with the money. #greed #old

1047 2018-01-07 15:19:08 Hi governor Murphy I can say thismy Sons are middle class as well as most of the employees I work with. Since the stocks have been doing well so have my sons & the employees & both will be getting raises. We must all continue to work together to improve the quality of our lives
1048 2018-01-07 15:18:11 No more stocks :(
1049 2018-01-07 15:17:44 I think any stocks that get buzz right now will see an influx of crypto investors that are shifting profits to non-crypto investments.  I think this will make Intel even stronger on the upcurve.

Great response! Make that money into more money.
1050 2018-01-07 15:17:30 If you want the savings, then buy the stocks.
1051 2018-01-07 15:17:07 You must not have stocks!!!
1052 2018-01-07 15:15:41 “when the stocks of AAPL or FB become tokens”

quite the headline. 

“when the future AAPL or FB will issue tokens instead of only stock”

even better headline.
1053 2018-01-07 15:12:54 If it is any reassurance they are both now laughing stocks and hopefully young boys will notice that as well. The Republicans & Tories lack support from young people and will continue to do so if they keep on like this.

1065 2018-01-07 15:06:29 #4 Investing in stocks are called as zero sum game, you wins reflects someone loose same, you are making profit because someone bought the stock and holding because its loss for him with equal amount...
1066 2018-01-07 15:06:13 He says he's done his research and says he has better chance of profiting from this than actually investing in stocks. He trusts the blockchain security even though it's multiple breaches.
1067 2018-01-07 15:05:48 (3)Its a good thing 4 the Brithish if they can leave the CFP, but to get a good stability in the Fishing stocks there always have to BE  a controled playingfield to secure Fishing oppertuneties 4 al EU Fisherman .

1068 2018-01-07 15:05:46 Freedom of Speech! He didn’t call ABC and ask them to fire him! However, if I had stocks in the stock market I’d be suing @ABCWorldNews for my losses that day!

1072 2018-01-07 15:03:41 No what I saying is they can't but pot stocks for their clients.  Because,all the brokers are owned by banks..  but of course they do different with their own accts.

1078 2018-01-07 14:55:51 The Emperor of the Bytes Estate states all peoples have the opportunity to purchase stocks in the stock market. Good things are happening under the #POTUS #DonaldTrump Administration. ....

This is your opportunity to connect with 60+ percent of America. Do some DD on the "pot stocks" in both Canada & USA
1080 2018-01-07 14:54:11 Exactly it’s about book sales and distraction and insuring that the MSM targets his tweets and his supposed hearsay embarrassing stories.   If the country was at war, under environmental duress (EQ, Hurricane etc.) stocks tanking or some other worldly issues it wouldn’t work.
1081 2018-01-07 14:53:48 PLEASE GO TO @VP shared yesterday ALL Pres. Trump's OUTSTANDING JOB & ALL HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! JOBS, TAX CUTS, STOCKS AT HISTORIC HIGHS, FORTUNE 500 CO. BACK, MANUFACTURER'S BACK, OBAMA CARE REPEALED, ETC...GROWTH, SUCCESS & PROSPERITY FOR ALL AMERICANS!
1082 2018-01-07 14:52:27 Anyway so a sad thing is yesterday me n DH went to Nakano Broadway and after combing through almost every shop I only came out with ONE Erwin badge... no one there stocks SNK stuff anymore 
1083 2018-01-07 14:51:43 ACA has helped millions. It's why repeal was opposed by over 80% of USA. The stock market has 0 to do with the economy. It's the top 20% making tons of money on speculation. The 80% don't own enough stocks to matter. My small portfolio isn't making me millions. 
More @GOP BS!
1084 2018-01-07 14:51:38 @unsavoryagents ESPN is a sports network but loses its mind when a team will go to the WH?  Reasonable people wonder what's the agenda?  Behavior validates POTUS comments re FAKE NEWS-unlike Hillary's "vast right-wing conspiracy." 16 yr low unemployment, Stocks @ all-time highs?

1086 2018-01-07 14:50:12 This does not surprise me. #45 probably has the same. When they came in office the stocks rose. This is so sad. Prisoners are looked at as $ instead of human beings.

1088 2018-01-07 14:49:26 @TulsiGabbard @Tim_Canova @RandPaul More sense than 7 trillion squandered in Iraq and Afghanistan. What was the ROI on that unless one owns defense stocks, and that is not the right reason to go to war.
1089 2018-01-07 14:48:53 Out at the bar last night the lead singer of the band brought up buying weed stocks and BTC.
1090 2018-01-07 14:48:06 That strong economy Trump Inherited it was all luck. When Obama was in office we had 4% unemployment already. Stocks were up. Soon stocks will drop and jobs will be lost. #Meetthepress

1112 2018-01-07 14:28:15 Sir, investors are investing in MF and stocks to get high returns. Nothing wrong in it. Unlike UPA government, NDA government is not telling citizens to invest in the stock market. Indeed, you must introspect and answer your question

1123 2018-01-07 14:24:53 @ffweekend The only existing evidence that President Trump is "crazy" is that he was willing to give up an amazing, fantastic life in order for him and his family to be bombarded 24/7 by vile assholes who aren't fit to even lick his boots.

He loves us and our country THAT much

1126 2018-01-07 14:22:24 If you retired in 2008 — the worst year in the market since the 1930s — needing 5% a year plus inflation, net of withdrawals today you’d have:

**6% MORE principal had you bought stocks
**17% LESS principal had you bought bonds

Time to rethink retirement “risk”?

1135 2018-01-07 14:16:30 Yeah..dont forget most sub £50mln cap AIM stocks priced indiscriminately for the grave yard..so when a company delivers and the message is spread it can be a very sharp move
1136 2018-01-07 14:14:08 This applies for most of the holders. But you're wrong about traders. (Who really profit).
happens with stocks also. Throw a dart at any s&p and wait. It will end up going up prob. Reality is that normal people finally can take a piece of the cake! Wealth distribution happening.

1176 2018-01-07 13:38:03 President Trump created more jobs in one year than Obama did in eight years. Stocks are at an all time high.  Businesses are coming back. Isis is on the run.  The mental instability is coming from the leftist. They are drunk with power. Blinded by jealousy.

1182 2018-01-07 13:34:49 Strong oil demand growth, the extension of the OPEC/non-OPEC supply agreement and supply outages (Iraqi fields, Keystone and UK Forties pipelines) have ensured continued high global stock draws in Q4/17 with OECD stocks now expected to reach 5-year average in Q1/18. - Pareto

No one's sacrificing their comforts.
1186 2018-01-07 13:31:31 It’s vital to be aware that most stocks are owned by the 1% by using fiber optics to determine what’s wanted,buying before we 98%ers are able to,then selling at a higher price.Thank millisecond info sending by fiber optics not #DonTheCon
1187 2018-01-07 13:31:10 But you can drive companies stocks down ruining people’s hard earned retirement cash when you open your pie hole.  You are crazy. Tick tock, your time is almost up as President.  You forget YOU WORK FOR us! Don’t forget that buddy.

1194 2018-01-07 13:25:07 Fantastic Mr. Vijay. Simplicity is what we need to learn otherwise the environment,  data,  analysts keep driving you away from the basic business acumen one needs to select, and sit tight on right stocks.
1195 2018-01-07 13:23:00 Is there anything beyond the obvious? What doesn’t make sense?  Except, how are bump stocks and high capacity magazines still legal? Congress is more concerned about their coffers, than constituents. It’s gross and pathetic.
1196 2018-01-07 13:21:51 Hahaha. As soon as trump won, stocks went up, our confidence went up, businesses became confident and began to invest again, I could even hire again. So shut up already about Obama. If the hag won, ayayay. It would be completely opposite.
1197 2018-01-07 13:20:23 Family made billions by scientific laundering & playing on stocks cheap than market rates for favors received. Now worried that a booming market will make all Indians rich. 
Jealous & nasty.
1198 2018-01-07 13:19:34 What great work?  Rich are richer. Poor are poorer. Regulations cut back so now our natural resources are in danger so rich can get richer! Health care is a mess. Market is up if you own stocks. I don’t. Rich get richer. Our country is more divided than ever. What is great?

1214 2018-01-07 13:03:00 Putting the actual American People before anything else, allowing All to flourish. Keeping Taxes steady and job's in all sectors growing. The Markets up, daily boast yet millions of people don't own stocks causing a larger Gap between lowest &highest incomes 45 is Clueless.
1215 2018-01-07 13:02:36 UBS...no that’s not true. All assets do have similar properties however market cap would be specific to stocks as it is useless and irrelevant for many other assets such as currencies.
1216 2018-01-07 13:01:54 The job cuts have been in the works for years, genius.  Before Trump.  At least they did get some bonuses!  If they don’t want them, I’ll take‘em.  I’m sure you could use them too as you claimed to dump stocks to avoid the economy crashing under Trump. Whoopsy.  Lol.  Moron.

1218 2018-01-07 13:00:06 You're saying Trump personally bought all those tech stocks?

Would you also agree that Bill Clinton is the reason the Dow went from 5700 in Jan. 1992 to 16,000 by 1999? Was that the president's doing, cause he's such a genius?

1232 2018-01-07 12:44:46 As to this argument that it is overvalued I want to make two points:
1) Market cap is irrelevant as these are currencies and not stocks. 
2) Either way, many of the worlds largest 29 banks are currently implementing Ripple’s xCurrent product and hopefully xRapid soon enough.

1242 2018-01-07 12:36:22 Will it cause someone to sell stocks and switch out? Stocks may have a harder time advancing in 2018 on rising rates, less global CB, high valuations measured against likely growth prospects? WS still seems to be all in on the imagined benefits of repatriation for equities.

1277 2018-01-07 11:50:46 That’s because companies on the market are pumping their own money into their stocks, which raise prices.  They do this instead of increasing wages and putting the money into the economy... you’d know that if you weren’t just looking for a clip.

1291 2018-01-07 11:28:10 The economy isn’t humming, the stock market is and it’s an unreal bubble. Stocks are running extremely over prices and it’s not translating into jobs or higher wages.

1292 2018-01-07 11:28:08 How many spinners have we had in the last 50 years who could bowl well away? I take your point that stocks are thin but we’ve never produced a procession of world class spinners. Or quicks for that matter.

1303 2018-01-07 11:19:04 I would agree about 5% fees if we were in a game of stocks and a good day would be 6%, but in the world of cryptos where 30% is your standard “good” day, that 5% isn’t *that* bad. Plus I don’t day trade that much, more of a long term holder. Hope this helps?
1304 2018-01-07 11:16:23 I saw stocks utility sector having good setups. $XLU looking good. $EXC (in the utility sector) is a long term investment candidate. (These stocks are my plan B in case $SPY never pullback )@2kaykim

1312 2018-01-07 11:11:39 While I agree it's bit tad too optimistic but gives you an big picture idea, one should be realistic. Most of us buy stocks so it's a bottom up analysis which would matter more.

1384 2018-01-07 09:38:01 Stocks are better than bonds - but are volatile

Bonds are better than FD - but in the medium trm

FDs are better than savings account - but are illiquid

Savings is better than spending - but needs discipline.

Each asset class is unique and needs some sacrifices. #investwisely
1385 2018-01-07 09:37:12 My net worth has gone up about 32% in 2017 and I started the year with a higher figure than yours. But yeah, US and world stocks have risen a whopping 20% last year, whereas Europe has been more moderate (disregarding EUR vs USD development)
1386 2018-01-07 09:35:59 Just so many cracking charts out there ... not enough time to post them all 
 
That being said, some of the charts I put up may be extended, so its always worth remembering not to chase stocks, no matter how hot the market and/or sector is.

1428 2018-01-07 08:19:10 Past Earnings growth was also linked to higher inflation or stock specific action. Inflation is unlikely to exceed 6% (unlike the past) so an earnings growth similar to past is unlikely. That said, individual stocks will continue to be interesting, index less important IMHO

1450 2018-01-07 07:47:06 I will say that’s true for all real markers. But the jump in stocks was all trump. Investors had hope so they all went out and bought before stock cost more. But I’m thinking by 2019 a huge drop or “market correction”.

1454 2018-01-07 07:43:31 This moron found the ball rolling and is claiming responsibility. When Obama left office, stocks and job numbers were progressively improving. What worse could he have done? Make it worse? Obama left you a country that has been in the repair shop for 8 years and u kept driving
1455 2018-01-07 07:42:25 That’s why our economies growing, unemployment is the lowest and stocks are highest they have ever been.

1462 2018-01-07 07:37:29 Who cares,only the rich invest in stocks, Trump made it easier by stealing from the working people to give to the corporations and banks taxpayer dollars & put the country in debt.
1463 2018-01-07 07:32:57 Seriously? Sean Hannity?
What in your opinion justifies that Trump should be responsible for any of the improvements on the stocks market and GDP? Your economy was in bad shape after Bush in 2008 and now it's beginning to seem improved again, you really accredit that to Trump?

1486 2018-01-07 07:04:52 The Bull Stock Market began during Obama's term. If you own stocks, U should know that. Unemployment levels became lowest, and CONSISTENTLY low during Obama's term. The jobs records are public records. We have been adding far fewer jobs under Trump.
1487 2018-01-07 07:04:16 People w/ 401ks are happy, retirees are scared SS to be used to pay for the stupid tax cuts for your millionaires/billionaires friends.

1514 2018-01-07 06:19:27 When investing in penny stocks you have to be both a trader and investor. Believe in the company but know when to sell (not all your holdings ) near the top before a retrace. You can then increase your holdings in the company or put your profits to work elsewhere.

1568 2018-01-07 05:37:10 That reminds me of when I see articles about how much stocks will go up for Biogen or another pharma when they introduce a newMS med. WooHoo! Look at how we can make these sick ppl pay even when they can’t . And call em lazy! Ugh.
1569 2018-01-07 05:36:30 Stocks are too intense. I like seeimg the growth but hate the lows
1570 2018-01-07 05:33:37 We were on upswing. If you own stocks you know this. Now our taxes get raised substantially. Besides all issues mentioned 45 promises arent good He gave the power to Mitch & Ryan. He hurt his own state! Did he read the tax scam? Mitch said he'll sign anything they give him!
1571 2018-01-07 05:33:21 Your right is your left and your left is your right. You definitely die, but also you don't die. Care about your practice, but not too much... whoa! stop being so attached to your practice. I think this is going to be an uphill battle for me.
1572 2018-01-07 05:32:18 EPS STRATEGY LIKE LOST STOCKS CEAT
1573 2018-01-07 05:29:50 Problem solved,,so it wasn’t overfishing that destroyed the cod stocks, they were just under disguise. I guess all you Gov scientists were wrong.
1574 2018-01-07 05:29:12 More in store until stocks last...
1575 2018-01-07 05:25:47 @myntra why selling old stocks goods....  This is my second time..  Please have a good quality check executive otherwise you may lose customers...
1576 2018-01-07 05:24:30 My biggest drawdowns came about when I thought trading is so easy and became careless picking new stocks to buy, coupled with an overconfident increase in position size. Bad combination. I hope I will be better at recognizing this situation next time.
1577 2018-01-07 05:21:19 What's next? Pictures of the many stocks and islands you own?
1578 2018-01-07 05:18:21 Sounds likes its working well :p haha
1579 2018-01-07 05:16:36 Nah.  Hard pass.  #maga 
What part of winning do you hate the most? Less taxes? Lower unemployment? Higher GDP? Higher stocks? No #DACA? Travel ban? No individual mandate? Defeating ISIS? Supporting Iranian Revolution?  
I like the dismantling of 0bama Hussein legacy the most.
1580 2018-01-07 05:16:19 He was playing back your own tweets. They are your own words. You sold your kids stocks after the election didn't you?

1582 2018-01-07 05:14:25 Stock go up because more people want to buy shares than there are that want to sell .
Its only money making money .
Wait till the moment the DIVIDENDS are given .
Then the rich are gonna sell high to the middle-class and stocks go down .
When de market crashes. The rich buy back
1583 2018-01-07 05:13:55 you do live on another planet. Here in America stocks are at all time high, military being built back up, corporations rebldg!

1586 2018-01-07 05:09:26 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
1587 2018-01-07 05:08:44 I think it's too easy to say it's the foreigners fault.

I've come to know quite a lot of Japanese collectors who are also hoarders and I doubt it's only the foreigners who buy up the leftover stocks.
1588 2018-01-07 05:07:13 THEORY:
We know that numerous members of Congress are either being blackmailed or bribed.

Bribing with cash is risky because moving large amounts of cash to a politician raises suspicions.

The Mercers/Kochs own vast amounts of stocks.

What if stocks are being used for bribery?
1589 2018-01-07 05:05:18 soooo i really wanna buy some stocks soon
1590 2018-01-07 05:04:49 Now this is just straight up false. Prove your statement to me with facts Mr. Coalition... I have to say I ain’t rich but I got stocks. I’ve owned stocks since 18 y/o  I had a few friends at the same age who did too.. my guess is you’re just being a little “extreme”
1591 2018-01-07 05:04:44 Compare Apples to Apples. The federal govt doesnt own stocks. So you don't include that in the discussion on private land ownership. It is probably more than 75% now. Ted Turner owns as I recall, 2 million acres and he is just one of the 5%.
1592 2018-01-07 05:04:29 Bravo! Nicely done.
1593 2018-01-07 05:04:18 Stocks are good. Robinhood is a good one to start off with and if you write me as your recommender we both get free shares haha

1599 2018-01-07 04:56:01 I mean a crypto currency could become the official world currency in the distant future and a way to invest in stocks
1600 2018-01-07 04:55:31 Everything I own seems to be going up with him. Stocks, business, wage, bonuses. I guess, Maxine, those things are bad for Americans. Man, you are wrong headed.

1634 2018-01-07 04:25:22 Hey, remember when you sold all of stocks because of the looming inevitable market crash if Donald Trump won?  My portfolio is  BOOMING 
1635 2018-01-07 04:23:50 Been killing it in the stocks too!!!

Bawahahahaha!!!!  What an idiot!!!!!
1640 2018-01-07 04:22:31 Nonsense huh. Heard you sold all your stocks after Trump elected and missed out on HUGE rally as well as caught looking at animae porn. Nonsense huh. 
1641 2018-01-07 04:21:49 reminds me of how stocks split their shares because of psychological reasons.

1645 2018-01-07 04:19:12 I guess you hate record low unemployment and record high stocks. Or maybe high consumer confidence. 1.7 million new jobs. Over 40 major companies give out bonuses after tax cut. Decreasing illegal border crossings. Secure homeland. All that’s bad I guess.
1646 2018-01-07 04:18:48 Kind of like the economy, stocks and Hilary's chance of going to prison.
1647 2018-01-07 04:18:00 Dude I’m not missleading people. I said “OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD”. I look at a lot of stocks can’t remember all off the cuff.
1648 2018-01-07 04:17:50 I'm sure I'm not the first to tell you, but the crypto market right now is super liquid. You can easily throw huge size on a hot "ticker". Think back to FNMA or HEMP when pot stocks had it's first boom.

1656 2018-01-07 04:11:50 80% of stocks are owned by the people that trump just gave a massive tax break to. Trump inherited a growing economy. He has done nothing for unemployment. And lastly, his killing of civilians will bring us far more terrorists.

1660 2018-01-07 04:08:54 Stock market doesn’t affect me since I can’t afford to invest in stocks. My hubs is Mexican & my daughter dates an African American man. We know what Trump thinks of them! That’s why I cannot talk to some family members who voted for that POS!
1661 2018-01-07 04:08:27 I still don't know what that is. What do I use my pick to buy stocks?
1662 2018-01-07 04:07:24 Never buy stocks or cryptocurrency from an issuer that has press releases, executive profiles, ticker prices, or encouragements to buy their stocks/coins on their home page.
1663 2018-01-07 04:07:18 "The race-track gambler, betting on a 'sure thing,' is convinced that his commitment is safe. The 1928 'investor' in high-priced common stocks also considered himself safe in his reliance upon future growth to justify the figure he paid and more" - Ben Graham

1670 2018-01-07 03:54:18 Stoploss Wala stock nahi Hai ye, as it's profits would go up, we will see it's reflection in it's stock price, it's a simple medium to understand how bank stocks perform.. and yes once it gets more in strong hands, we will see it enjoying RBL kind of valuations..
1671 2018-01-07 03:53:34 Ahhh, most people make the mistake of putting too many conditions in their scan. I only search for $1-20 stocks then I click on the volume tab so I can track where everyone is and correlate using StockTwits & Twitter. Works like magic!
1672 2018-01-07 03:53:24 Dems and Libs been taking Ls in 2017, especially with the moves Trump’s been making.

1673 2018-01-07 03:53:02 This is, like, five responses- but what the fuck? What's next? Is the NYT lifestyle section going to have an article about how you can pick stocks by examining chicken entrails?

1682 2018-01-07 03:42:21 Great!! Now watch skate stocks go up in price !!
1683 2018-01-07 03:40:37 If you're going to buy stocks or cryptocurrencies, never buy them from issuers who say they're going to provide a groundbreaking product or service that will fill people's needs. Buy it from the issuers who have been filling the most people's needs.

1687 2018-01-07 03:36:00 Your corrupt dems are making laughing stocks out of all of you brainwashed fools. Just saying.
1688 2018-01-07 03:35:34 What they will do--and always have with tax cuts--is pay dividends to stockholders, buy back their own stocks to boost the price even more, then pay out more to stockholders, ad nauseam. Check history there are more than just a few examples. Enron comes to mind, in fact.
1689 2018-01-07 03:35:02 Excellent sir . I have been reading The practising mind and The Inner game of tennis . Both have a common pattern saying to think about Present Non-judgementally ! A point worth noting to think more about stocks even when talking less and to learn from Charlie Mungers life

1694 2018-01-07 03:32:39 But at first you said it would be hard to find a company doing buy backs.   It relates to the tax cuts because they are using those savings to buy back the stocks. Yes they are accountable to their stockholders, not so much their employees.
1695 2018-01-07 03:32:24 Fed keeps alternating dovish hints, then hawkish, keeping bond market sideways. That makes it hard to read. Fact that theyre saying anything vaguely dovish at 25k Dow is sign they know how fragile it is. Millenials are chasing cryptos,or too broke,to buy retiring boomer's stocks
1696 2018-01-07 03:32:19 Good. Why don't you talk about stocks that you own or owned and performed poorly ? That would teach people a lot more.
1697 2018-01-07 03:32:09 If you are referring to stocks where the higher time frame cci >100, then daily cci <-100 is the best time to enter
1698 2018-01-07 03:31:09 Someone tweet me if the Democrats do anything beyond crossing their arms.... Do you think Nancy Pelosi bought into the cannabis stocks.

1702 2018-01-07 03:29:34 Actually it could be substantial in holistic view / 1 to 1.5 % on digital management of stocks +3-4% on transport (not arterial but small towns-Villages + live or reduced bulk of Warehousing 2 % + Inventory investments 2-3 % + Fouling of commodities 1-5 %
1703 2018-01-07 03:28:31 The people there can't invest in stocks, so instead they invest in property. And then the properties just sit empty.
1704 2018-01-07 03:28:30 Half of Americans don't even really know what stocks are.
1705 2018-01-07 03:27:50 Try out this stock app I just posted you get a free stock if someone uses your link or use my link to sign up and you and buy or sell stocks
1706 2018-01-07 03:27:21 Right.     Because 2% growth beats 5% growth every time.  And of course the stock market is permanent.  We can all just go sell those stocks anytime we want.
1707 2018-01-07 03:26:04 Time to load up on stocks of black lace, tons of dayglo lipgloss and hairspray

1710 2018-01-07 03:23:40 The good thing about Trumps election win is no more bad trade deals, no more funding over seas abortions, no more funding coutries that harbor and fund terrorists, ISIS dying, stocks, jobs, jobs, jobs, corruption being exposed and Patriots are shouting free at last. #ThankGOD
1711 2018-01-07 03:22:22 I’m still invested in robotic and automation stocks, as well as Bitcoin /BTC and Ethereum /ETH.  #stockmarket
1712 2018-01-07 03:21:54 I'm sure there are many other ways that corrupt politicians receive illicit funds. Superpack campaign money is just one way. Stocks, bonds, partnerships other ways.
1713 2018-01-07 03:21:03 Oh! I don't recall it improving for years!  My 401K and Stocks don't reflect that narrative! Trump's Tax Cuts and pro business policies have been major factor. Black unemployment rate is also at the lowest level since the government began tracking the data in 72!
1714 2018-01-07 03:20:18 I hope when those companies+ stop buying their own stocks for the benefit of their shareholders that the people's 401Ks don't take a huge nosedive.
1715 2018-01-07 03:19:09 About 50 % of Americans own no stocks what so ever rich get richer is not making America great America's greatness comes from all us blue collar working joes not the rich fat cats taking my tax dollars to subsidize their private jets
1716 2018-01-07 03:17:59 Yea yea heard that A LOT. Heard that as a toddler with Regan. But the POTUS has boosted our economy with tax reform, boosted job growth, & stocks ( making ur 401k beautiful right now) which is more growth in the US our home than Obama & Cuntlon (Clinton) combined. 
1717 2018-01-07 03:16:17 stupid statement The Dow takes real money to buy stocks So the wealthy have borrowed from banks to invest while counting on tax break

1725 2018-01-07 03:10:48 Given the oversold reading of HYG... we could have an even more massive rally in stocks Feb - April, just when everyone wants a pullback

1728 2018-01-07 03:08:30 Dilemma of Value & Growth Investors

Many of my close circles friends who are seasoned investors in a state of dilemma

High quality stocks are seemingly underperforming amidst big momentum play in low qlty

Learning

Stick to what is best. 
Markets are slaves of earnings.
1729 2018-01-07 03:08:00 It means they're taking an aggregate measure. Some stocks pay no dividends, some pay big ones that exceed 2%. Building a portfolio for yield means making choices.
1730 2018-01-07 03:07:59 Black cod is my absolute fave! But stocks are not doing so well.  I fish it once a year in Alaska and savor it all year. Great recipe thanks! Gonna try this one too!
1731 2018-01-07 03:06:12 I think it has something to do with their stocks.
1732 2018-01-07 03:04:46 You mean stocks will plunge if he is removed? Is that a good thing or a bad thing to you?
1733 2018-01-07 03:04:44 lmao then bitcoin stocks going up 
1734 2018-01-07 03:03:47 I assume market thinks economic outlook is good. Market thinks either book is wrong or book is irrelevant to economic outlook. Stocks did great last year with this President. New tax bill reduces corporate taxes.
1735 2018-01-07 03:03:29 Sessions and the rest of thoes crooked a$$hole$ need to get their ducks in a row with the pot stocks first.....cant have a new batch of millionaires without doing some insider trading first.
1736 2018-01-07 03:02:10 Fake internet photo! LEARN FOR UR SELF, THE TRUTH IS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY, and all u trump supporters r selling AMERICA OUT FOR MONEY THAT ISNT EVEN IN UR POCKET UNLESS U HAVE STOCKS!  And less than 50 percent of Americans own ANY STOCK!
1737 2018-01-07 03:01:19 Gold should hit buyable 1270 support by Tuesday, before lunch, at the rate cryptos are moving up. Unless, of course, stocks rollover.
There is no scenario where stocks, cryptos, and metals can all go up at the same time. There's only room for two
1738 2018-01-07 03:01:19 In my experience it's a normal bull market (according to Shiller's  Irrational Exuberance) tech stocks, new era, cheap $, media spruiking. But the low volatility is something to behold.
1739 2018-01-07 03:00:53 @madhuvasanti38 RT @dmuthuk: Everyone’s opinion is HDFC Life is very expensive. It has only become more expensive after the run up post listing. Again, HDFC Life would be 20 year kind of holding for me. How many stocks we can be confident of holding for 20 years?

I’ma need you to start telling me what stocks to invest in cause your insight is god level. 
1752 2018-01-07 02:46:05 Sir bit don't you believe in these graphite like stories, they are more cyclical in nature. Your beliefs are more on stocks that u would hold for 10+ years, you don't do any short term investment

The reason bump stocks exist is because the government closed the machine gun registry in 1986, innovation tries to find a way around this legislation.
If the registry had been left open, I doubt bump stocks would even exist.
1757 2018-01-07 02:41:22 He’s doing a good job.  Lower taxes.  More jobs stocks at record highs....cheap gas......worry about the idiots up here
1758 2018-01-07 02:41:06 Meanwhile, Trump is in a Big Mac food coma, asleep at the actual wheel.
Your stocks are doing great? Obama says you’re welcome.
At this point, peddling Trump support and conspiracy theories means one of two things: you’re ignorant, or disingenuous.
Which are you?

Pesky fact...no funds.
1761 2018-01-07 02:40:35 i hate being early to see potential in stocks and crypto and never doing anything. I literally could have made thousands if i had just invested.
1762 2018-01-07 02:38:37 Me too, I just haven't found evidence for foreign state involvement. There is that crooked-ass sell off of his stocks in the Hedge Fund that was being investigated upon his receiving the Directorship.

1766 2018-01-07 02:34:43 Stock Market isn’t the only measurement of the economy, stupid! It’s also virtually a useless metric for struggling Americans who *work* for a living and cannot afford to BUY stocks because food, healthcare, housing and education eat up all of their income!

1768 2018-01-07 02:33:39 Personal opinion alert:  you may want to look at how Trend Following programs set a trailing stop for stocks that are at all time/52 wk highs.  Maybe set wider stops for the ones you really love and tighter for the ones you are more iffy on.  Check out @LMT978

ISIS is dissolving. Wouldn’t it be original among your cronies to stand for truth justice & the American way? Be a leader

1781 2018-01-07 02:15:05 And what else do THEY say?  I say Donald Trump is doing a stellar job as President.  Stock Market is on the rise! I used to play with stocks but got out while I was ahead.  I'm thinking about diving back in.  Keep doing whatever it is you're doing. It's working for America.

1798 2018-01-07 02:05:43 I was talking to someone earlier about the same thing......it’s pretty amazing but overall it’s really new penny stocks, not just Pot.

1801 2018-01-07 02:04:54 The DOW Index is a stock Index, NOT the economy. It's only 30 large American multinationals, only 2 NasDaqs, so it also reflects business outside our economy. The S&P is 500 stocks, the Russell 2000 is much more reflective of the stockmarket.
1802 2018-01-07 02:04:22 What do you do if you're too poor to be able to own any stocks?

1805 2018-01-07 02:02:10 That is a dumb comment. The dow jones is made up of 30 companies stock prices and people who work for this companies do very, very, well salary wise. Many/most get stock or have retirement portfolios with large cap stocks so they will have money in retirement. Educate yourself.

1831 2018-01-07 01:45:05 New rules for Markets and Anal lists should make thing more confusing to Game stocks
1832 2018-01-07 01:45:01 The fact that this uses no stocks just made it so much more impressive. Great job man!
1833 2018-01-07 01:44:53 I take option profits and dollar cost average into stocks/index funds/mutual funds. This should be an option in the poll
1834 2018-01-07 01:44:49 You must develop standards when dealing with women. A woman must have the potential to be emotional, physically and logistically available in order for her to be worth your time. Otherwise, she's a bad investment and that energy/time is better invested in more profitable stocks.
1835 2018-01-07 01:43:44 If you don't know what the FY policy has to do with who is POTUS, then you truly don't have any business discussing stocks or anything else.
1836 2018-01-07 01:43:10 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
1837 2018-01-07 01:42:44 Friday’s (Jan 5) rally meant that none of the equity indexes have posted a down day so far in 2018. For the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, it was the fourth straight closing record, while the Dow carved out its third in a row #DowJones #SP500 #SPX #Nasdaq #Stocks #StockMarkets #USStocks
1838 2018-01-07 01:42:30 Good companies tend to get over valued and they go through many periods of time correction. Still in how many stocks, you can expect (no guarantees) 20% CAGR over 20 years? 20% in 20 years is wealth multiplying by 40 times.
1839 2018-01-07 01:42:26 You mean those poor people? Probably true, most could not afford to buy stocks.
1840 2018-01-07 01:41:45 #DJIA rose 220.74 points (Jan 5) or 0.9%, to 25,295.87. The S&P 500 index closed up 19.16 points or 0.7%, at 2,743.15. #Nasdaq Composite Index gained 58.64 points to 7,136.56, a gain of 0.8% #DowJones #SP500 #SPX #Stocks #StockMarkets #StockTrading #StockIndexes #USStocks
1841 2018-01-07 01:41:13 You do realize ballooning sovereign debt cheapens currency and makes stocks more valuable, right? Or did you guys miss the Obama years entirely? That’s what the rest of the world is doing now, but not America anymore.
1842 2018-01-07 01:40:18 All 3 main equity benchmarks posted record gains on Friday (Jan 5) to end the first week of 2018 on a stellar footing, marked by 4 straight positive session, following lackluster jobs data. #DowJones #SP500 #SPX #Nasdaq #Stocks #StockMarkets #StockTrading #StockIndexes #USStocks
1843 2018-01-07 01:40:00 I'll never understand how some investors just marry ONE stock or commodity. Actively trading a few stocks will outperform even some of the best performers.
1844 2018-01-07 01:38:59 The regulations they are cutting are things like safety standards in coal mining/ oil drilling/food production. The DOW Jones is America’s top 30 public companies and is designed to improve over time (bad performers are kicked off). Also 84% of stocks are owned by wealthiest 10%.
1845 2018-01-07 01:36:40 Smokin weed and bamboo sippin on private stocks
1846 2018-01-07 01:35:11 1.5m invested in bank and insurance stocks makes 100K a year in dividends alone before stock appreciation.
1847 2018-01-07 01:34:30 I'll take my +$150K in stocks since Trump. Thank you president Trump. Those who sold stocks are total morons. Cuban said the market would crash w/Trump. Another "genius". SO happy w/my president!
1848 2018-01-07 01:33:10 Exactly!! Ever since Trump won my stocks have been going up big time!
1849 2018-01-07 01:32:25 Damn I was going to buy stock in US Steel Friday. Glad I own AK Steel call options but looking to buy infrastructure stocks Monday.
1850 2018-01-07 01:32:23 No, that’s not the issue. Education would be way too expensive in general if we only had private versions. Then parents would spend all their money on education bills instead of consuming on Main Street or investing in stocks
1851 2018-01-07 01:31:08 Are you long stocks or bonds?
1852 2018-01-07 01:31:06 Pidilite (which I own) has been one of the excellent and consistent wealth creators (5 year & 10 year CAGR of 32% and 26% respectively). Stocks like these mostly does not come into retail investor radar as they are busy chasing the next graphite story.
1853 2018-01-07 01:30:54 @realdonaldtrump should be fired, for his repeated lies, use of tax payer funded office to attack the private sector and its employees when he is butt hurt. Bragging about causing health care stocks to implode - take your pick!
1854 2018-01-07 01:28:58 Top Runner!!.. fake news winner!!.>>>>sell all your stocks hurry!!>>TOO LATE!!.. loser
1855 2018-01-07 01:28:26 I had a 401k but after my divorce I had to slowly liquidate all my stocks just to pay the bills. I’m sixty and in good health but I don’t see retirement anywhere in my future. I’m a Navy veteran that served as a missle tech on submarines during the Cold War. American Dream? Ha!
1856 2018-01-07 01:27:39 I earned 27% on my 401k-don’t blame the POTUS because you don’t know how to invest in stocks. Stop with your phony charts you are starting to come unglued
1857 2018-01-07 01:27:00 Fake news winner for sure >>>>> @kurteichenwald <<<<<<< you should also sell all your stocks....oops to late jackass
1858 2018-01-07 01:26:57 Why don’t people notice, just because the stock market gets record highs, doesn’t mean you get a raise? I never have. People are such sheep. Yea! Stock market is up. Do you have any stocks,? No? Then STFU!
1859 2018-01-07 01:26:41 @kurteichenwald Congrats, u are on Fox for tweeting that you sold your stocks (on the advise of your investment advisor) “because it was about to crash” .  BUT, the stock has been going up and just went above 25,000.  Kurt, I hope u fired him
1860 2018-01-07 01:26:25 Fake news winner for sure >>>>> @kurteichenwald <<<<<<< you should also sell all your stocks....oops to late jackass
1861 2018-01-07 01:26:23 Imaginary $, totally made up. But the stupid politician who thought every American had stocks is worse bcuz that is how emotionally removed from majority of Americans they are.
1862 2018-01-07 01:26:12 Fake news winner for sure >>>>> @kurteichenwald <<<<<<< you should also sell all your stocks....oops to late jackass
1863 2018-01-07 01:25:58 @kurteichenwald You are the biggest communist I have ever heard!  Liar is not string enough of a word to describe you.  Continue to get paid by Soros & @DNC & you will be ok.  Great job on Shelly your stocks, Nice!
1864 2018-01-07 01:25:54 Fake news winner for sure >>>>> @kurteichenwald <<<<<<< you should also sell all your stocks....oops to late jackass

1866 2018-01-07 01:25:34 However, some grocery stores (like select Walmarts) have a smaller bodega style storefront at the front of the store that only stocks WIC items, and it has one register.

1870 2018-01-07 01:24:38 The Dow has flourished because of two distinctive stocks for two distinctive reasons:

War (Boeing)
Hurricanes (Caterpillar)

What two things has Trump encouraged with his policies?
So buckle up.

1871 2018-01-07 01:24:35 @kurteichenwald Best selling author? You sir are a complete fool! We all laughed hearing you sold your stocks afraid they would fall under @POTUS! Hard to believe you are paid to contribute to anything!
1872 2018-01-07 01:24:33 You should be lucky that people on the left may not watch @WattersWorld loving all the fake news you've reported. How's your bank account after selling off all your stocks.. @kurteichenwald
1873 2018-01-07 01:23:22 Team effort! You were holding down the stocks and getting kills like crazy
1874 2018-01-07 01:21:55 @kurteichenwald hey Kurt...good move on selling all your kids stocks..brilliant!!...no one booed btw!! @JesseBWatters ..@realDonaldTrump #MAGA
1875 2018-01-07 01:20:52 Two arguments: 1) Stocks that haven't run with others in similar sector are underperforming and should be avoided. 2) Stocks that haven't run with others can gain from profit taking in leaders and "Sector rotation." Both happen all the time.
1876 2018-01-07 01:20:07 2018; Credit, stocks&bonds, some miscellaneous shit, and lastly GUN PERMIT
1877 2018-01-07 01:19:13 I want to invest in common stocks, but it seems so overwhelming. Any advice? I want my money to grow for at least the next 5-6 years.
1878 2018-01-07 01:19:04 @NicolasMaduro Nico olvidate de las INVERSIONES EXTRANJERAS, cuantas veces crees tu que puedes expropiar una empresa, decomisar sus inventarios, obligar a vender con perdidas, rematar sus stocks, el resultado es simple: cierres, quiebras, mudanzas a otros países = "COLAPSO TOTAL"
1879 2018-01-07 01:18:54 He's #MAGA, whether or not you like him & his ways.

1880 2018-01-07 01:17:37 "next up on fox stocks, fox yawns are trading at an all time high!"
1881 2018-01-07 01:15:14 Tell me @repblumenauer did you liquidate all your stocks in Nov 2106? Asking for a friend as he really respects your advice & opinions. Ass
1882 2018-01-07 01:14:55 Maybe. The browns fans are laughing stocks tho. Not that we’re much better
1883 2018-01-07 01:14:04 Glad to see someone else going for the weed stocks 
1884 2018-01-07 01:14:02 When you talk about your job on a date and then he wants to talk about penny stocks & weed etf's. JUST STOP
1885 2018-01-07 01:13:58 Why Sonic fans are laughing stocks

Fans that unironically think songs like Classic Green Hill in Forces are good.
1886 2018-01-07 01:13:37 Why would Wallstreet Billionaires &Fortune500 Companies needbiggest tax cuts when Stocks have Gained Trillions! Federal Minimum Wage is $7.25 An hour! You Promised 2help American People You have Failed Miserably!  #TaxReformScam #TrumpRussia
1887 2018-01-07 01:13:36 During this time I've felt the need to keep over a third in cash to pick up opportunities in good stocks.  I have also found that holding for shorter periods in said shit stocks provides somewhat of a safeguard.  Left plenty on the table mind you....
1888 2018-01-07 01:11:30 They insulted their own book n god and made them laughing stocks.
1889 2018-01-07 01:10:16 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1890 2018-01-07 01:10:09 If rappers were stocks then I would invest my life savings into @kevinabstract and @brckhmptn . I can’t remember the last time I heard a genuinely fresh new album, let alone 3 at once. These dudes are in the driver’s seat to do something special.
1891 2018-01-07 01:09:58 @guerillacricket Shoot left handers/armers? It speaks to the paucity of English spin stocks that Deadly Derek Underwood (left armer) is England's most successful Test spin bowler. Haven't even mentioned Panesar who is the only English spinner to take a 5-fer at Perth.
1892 2018-01-07 01:09:33 haha.. My portfolio also has exactly 11 stocks (Most recent is HDFC life IPO) and looks like we share at least 6-7 stocks in our portfolios. (I am also waiting for NSE IPO. Going to be one of my permanent holding)
1893 2018-01-07 01:08:06 Lucky?  Don’t be jealous of people doing well. Instead, consider bad choices being made by “everyday”people. You can invest in a 401k or buy some stocks. Maybe you’ll be in a better boat.
1894 2018-01-07 01:07:49 And which stocks do you own?  How exactly has the upturn, which @realDonaldTrump called a red herring in the past, impact your life?  You’ll find out when individual tax cuts expire while those for the richest among us don’t. Hoodwinked
1895 2018-01-07 01:07:23 Yes. I want to own a focused portfolio. Now have 11 stocks. Will buy NSE when it gets listed. May not go beyond 15 stocks.
1896 2018-01-07 01:07:18 The challenge is not to trade but to manage your emotions! #trading #stocks #PENNYSTOCKS #MoneyTalks
1897 2018-01-07 01:06:55 Been a crazy month. One of the best to date already!

My picks going into next week

Crypto: $trx $xvg

Have a good week!!
1898 2018-01-07 01:06:03 California, keep up the fight for your state Cannabis sales- Medicinal and Recreational. Have a look at our Canadian Model coming to fruition. I have a few American stocks - let’s see them rise NOT decline. And, Americans,  bring your dollars over here to our pot stocks.
1899 2018-01-07 01:05:46 “MEAN”—Is Amateur talk! Stocks move FROM—The Largest Buy orders—TO—The Largest Sell orders.
1900 2018-01-07 01:04:21 That would be unbelievably lit our teams were the laughing stocks of the division for over 5 years
1901 2018-01-07 01:03:12 All the stocks I own like Pidilite, HDFC Bank etc.
1902 2018-01-07 01:02:09 Well done. I’ve noticed this for a while. Crypto is the new age penny stocks allowing all collars to invest. Knowing how the market is perceived, what’s your top 5 picks based on “hype” not tech or other realistic reasons lol
1903 2018-01-07 01:02:01 Super Stocks v5.0.5 is available for download in the app store now. With support near 2000 #cryptocurrency real-time quotes and charts. Support in watchlist and portfolio. #BTC #bch #ltc #XRP #eth #ada #NEM
1904 2018-01-07 01:01:35 Tax return is suppose to be around 4K & as much as I want to take about 2K of that and fill the rest of my body with tats I think I’m gonna invest into some stocks instead
1905 2018-01-07 01:00:01 When he said that he forgot Obama created the booming stocks in US he just ran out of time to see it come to fruition! Yerrrrrr right!
1906 2018-01-07 00:59:36 Last year incredible performance of global stock markets had proven that new records can last much longer than what bearish thought!

1907 2018-01-07 00:58:45 Stocks are not the same even close
1908 2018-01-07 00:58:44 We own stocks and we are far from rich! Go back to your democratic world full of criminals!
1909 2018-01-07 00:58:10 But the unemployment rate, which they had said was “fake,” has gone under 5%!!! It’s Trump, so it’s not fake. And investors love dem stocks!
1910 2018-01-07 00:57:45 The percent of SP100 stocks above the 50 Daily Moving Average is the bottom graph, circled at the end shows that we closed above 85 Friday.
1911 2018-01-07 00:57:05 Everyone’s opinion is HDFC Life is very expensive. It has only become more expensive after the run up post listing. Again, HDFC Life would be 20 year kind of holding for me. How many stocks we can be confident of holding for 20 years?
1912 2018-01-07 00:56:16 ... If all the numiners are correct & stocks are high, low income people don't have the money to invest, especially if stocks are high.
1913 2018-01-07 00:56:11 Favorite part of the Pacers vs Bulls game was looking over at the Drumline to see the tenor player drop his stocks over the balcony 
1914 2018-01-07 00:55:32 President Trump you are bringing our country back from ruin!  Our stocks are at an all time high, the tax revision enabled companies finally to reward employees with raises and resume a bonus for those long overdue!  Employment is higher than it has been in the past 8 years.
1915 2018-01-07 00:55:02 Yes, there is a short-term tax gain, but you do realise that the tax benefit is temporary, and that the other factors that were included in the bill mean that in the end you will lose out? The stock market IS up - for now - but unless you have stocks and shares that's no help.
1916 2018-01-07 00:53:14 A sugar daddy that only wants good conversation and a little time. Willing to give me investment money to purchase stocks, property, and cryptocurrency. 
1917 2018-01-07 00:51:59 looks like ABCD setup for stocks works on Forex daily charts as well.
1918 2018-01-07 00:51:35 Laughing stocks as always I hate this feeling every year and I knew it I fell for it again damit
1919 2018-01-07 00:49:40 The economy is only on fire if you were already wealthy. Obama was already deporting tons of people, 45 is just carrying on with people that actually benefit our country. If your going to mention stocks, don't. 50% of working Americans make less than 30k, they can't invest, no $$
1920 2018-01-07 00:47:28 Lots of room for select #Chinese stocks, with good setups to play catch up next week.

1921 2018-01-07 00:45:38 My stocks are going nicely.  Looking forward to the lower income tax.  Sharia law not my cup of tea, nor MS13.  Roads without pot holes would be nice, and I do enjoy Christmas.  Clintons say no more.
1922 2018-01-07 00:44:05 @bp22 do u see the cannabis stocks bouncing back? They took a beating this week
1923 2018-01-07 00:43:26 Want to know how fast things are progressing? It’s a bit like picking stocks. The future started yesterday. You are already behind the curve. #TheCuttingEdge
1924 2018-01-07 00:40:42 Sheesh, I can imagine. I wish I was holding some around then.

It kinda sucks that US video game stocks take a while to pop. TTWO did nice this year, but not much else. No harm in holding ATVI and Tencent though now that esports is poised to boom. ATVI is still at a good entry.
1925 2018-01-07 00:40:39 Could we ask you, @joshgad, @MarkRuffalo & @HamillHimself the same thing? Endless negative hate, not one positive post about the president and things going on! I'm sure you will enjoy your tax cut & stocks.

1929 2018-01-07 00:37:52 Nope my guys have done me well through many crisis (2002, 2008) slow and steady growth. Very well protected...just this last surge paid off on some stocks.
1930 2018-01-07 00:36:22 People are looking at their house value/stocks and seeing the number go up a lot, so they’re saving less of the money they’re currently earning
1931 2018-01-07 00:36:15 All good questions. I could be wrong but I think we are looking at an inflationary scenario instead of a deflationary crash. I think U stocks are going to blow the doors off as they have in the past.
1932 2018-01-07 00:36:07 What is the required free float level for stocks listed on the NSE @nsenigeria ?

Are there any stats that show how many companies are compliant with this requirement?

1935 2018-01-07 00:32:49 Aggressive moves for $AA as of late. Rest, yes. I’m expecting a 5 to 7 point correction, then a bit of stability. Earnings to be released, with expected charges on the smelter shutdown. Unsure of anything else, but the stock has appreciated a lot. Time for a rest. #alcoa #stocks
1936 2018-01-07 00:32:28 Tell me about it! I'm moving more and more toward cryptos. Too many salty traders (except a few generous ones) on the stocks are so protective and anal about sharing and giving a hand to newbs - hard to develop quickly. We all want to win. The real enemy are the bankers anyway.
1937 2018-01-07 00:32:08 Health Insurance stocks, which is the woman, I’d thank her in the polls since Election. Highest Stock Market EVER, Military
1938 2018-01-07 00:31:46 How are your stocks doing?  Probably great, since Trump got in!   TRUMP2020!!!!!!!
1939 2018-01-07 00:30:08 @Edinburgh_Gin In love with your Liqueurs. Other than online, do you know of any stores (anywhere) in the Netherlands that stocks you? 
1940 2018-01-07 00:30:06 I got God and stocks to Thank for my tattoos 
1941 2018-01-07 00:27:16 That's true, but that's just also how math works. If you invest $5 and stocks go up 10%, you benefit a lot less than if you invest $500.
1942 2018-01-07 00:26:00 just analyzed last few weeks of my trading, getting so much more consistent. but still take that bigger unnecessary revenge trade & loss once a week or so. gotta set a rule to never  turn a $200+ day red and ill be good! $2018 $Stocks $CNIT $CNET
1943 2018-01-07 00:22:15 The Dow Jones Average is basically the cost in dollars of a basket of stocks. So it trends upward because of inflation. That's why it's constantly hitting all-time highs.
1944 2018-01-07 00:21:45 In other markets like Germany and Korea, where few households own stocks, there's no demonstrable relationship btw valuations & demographics
1945 2018-01-07 00:21:32 He sold all his stocks last November and has been in cash ever since. Tweeted that Trump victory would result in market crash. Also admits he’s a dumbass. Now lies about it. It’s amusing.
1946 2018-01-07 00:21:24 Thanks! I wonder though, considering current equity valuations overall, whether the U bull mkt to come would be as explosive, and how would U stocks behave under higher U prices + a stock mkt crash scenario.
1947 2018-01-07 00:20:49 Stocks are not an indicator of economy.  You know that right??  Increase actually proves tax bill as scam, as corps are buying up their own stocks, falsley inflating prices.  Educate yourself.  Read a book.  Econ 101  would be a good start
1948 2018-01-07 00:19:59 If you had a 60% allocation to stocks, stocks rallied so you now have an 80% allocation, and then you sell 5% so have a 75% allocation.

Is your demand higher or lower for stocks with a 60% allocation or 75% allocation? You certainly own more in $$ terms.
1949 2018-01-07 00:17:47 Good man, you've got yourself. Make sure he stocks up on the 17YO Old Pulteney whilst he still has the chance :-)
1950 2018-01-07 00:17:33 Missing you on F&F Weekend I hope everything is going well for you. I have started investing in stocks last year, and hope to invest more
1951 2018-01-07 00:17:30 Well your boy just killed al my stocks with his marijuana hoopla. So hey. Thanks for that. Big fat jerk.
1952 2018-01-07 00:16:51 ROFL.  HRC not facing indictment.  Stock market not an indicator of economy. Only 50% of Americans invested in market.  Proves the tax bill was a scam as companies are reinvesting in company stocks to pay shareholders, and not wages.  Facts matter.  Read a book.
1953 2018-01-07 00:16:08 My dude, there are some quality stocks out there and they’re so good for you too.
1954 2018-01-07 00:15:47 Rich people that but stocks are not very bright... just saying.
1955 2018-01-07 00:14:53 this next tweet will explain why I trade these tech stocks.. THIS is where the growth is and will continue to be. $fb $aapl $googl $amzn $nvda $amd $tsla $baba $nflx $bidu $ntes $intc $twtr
1956 2018-01-07 00:14:34 It hasn't been 4.0 since Obama, right. Oh by the way, the stock market is booming cause companies are buying back their own stocks. That means they are investing less. That means they aren't planning to grow as much. Way to overhype nothing.
1957 2018-01-07 00:12:15 I forget which, but I actually heard a politician say “everyone owns stocks”
1958 2018-01-07 00:11:06 Are you trying to tell me that stocks were hitting the same numbers that they are now don't think so try again
1959 2018-01-07 00:07:55 how much are stocks to kms
1960 2018-01-07 00:05:58 The SM is rising in anticipation of some of therepatriated corporate $$$ being used to buy stocks. Wall Street knows that's where some of that money is going so they're front running it.
1961 2018-01-07 00:05:03 It was eye opening when I saw market cap today $AOI is definitely wayyy undervalued, oil is hitting 62$resistance if oil drops I be buying into 57.50$ support . Long gold stocks and $GRO 
1962 2018-01-07 00:04:28 I don’t have stocks either, but I perceive Dow Up is good for us.
1963 2018-01-07 00:04:25 Absolute truth, not just Trump, most of the Republicans are just as greedy, they only care about their donors and making millions on investments through major companies due to the fact they get early info about stocks going up before the public knows!!!
1964 2018-01-07 00:04:01 Hahahaha, this is hilarious.

*accountant flies into the executive board room of Zaya Rum Co.*

"Sir, our profits are going through the roof and stocks dwindling fast!   Macrofurs have taken a liking to our rum!"

*the executives eyes go wide...*

"Increase production 200,000%!"
1965 2018-01-07 00:03:57 And yeah, it's a great drink. I'm so glad there is finally a shop in my town that occasionally stocks it.
1966 2018-01-07 00:03:05 Or we could use these talking points: stocks, IRA, 401Ks,employment up. ISIS all but gone, illegal boarder crossing down, more money in paychecks.
1967 2018-01-07 00:01:51 I've been in Bitcoin for 4.5 years and I still get surprised often. BTC went up $4500 this week on the weekly chart!!! BITCOIN. STOP DOING THAT!!! your not supposed to do that!!! BAD BOY!!!! Your only supposed to do what stocks do!!
1968 2018-01-07 00:00:29 These people who assault teachers should be put in the stocks .
1969 2018-01-06 23:59:54 I think you have to be able to pick what you are actually investing it in...IRAs don't default to putting money into stocks. I specify stuff for mine. But IANA qualified financial advisor
1970 2018-01-06 23:58:10 Mark Cuban has stocks in Etherum...was gonna sell it but now he made me change my mind
1971 2018-01-06 23:58:06 You have a 401k?  That’s Stocks. Unless you don’t know how to “portfolio”
1972 2018-01-06 23:57:18 Doesn’t Herb Greenberg think Baba has accounting irregularities? I think it’s one of his main shorts. I like all the other stocks all year but I don’t trust baba.
1973 2018-01-06 23:55:17 If you hold large number of stocks, you'll get only market returns. In that case, better to hold index.
1974 2018-01-06 23:54:22 Asset inflation tends to follow this pattern. Stocks/bonds->housing-> commodities-> stocks/bonds.
1975 2018-01-06 23:54:18 rightt like adults can get them and acrylics but children should only get stocks on like i hope they know how bad it hurts to break On my way!
1976 2018-01-06 23:53:39 Gee Mike all I care is that my stocks are way up the last 13 months. Trumps net worth means nothing to me . Sorry it means so much to you. Also saving $30k per year with repeal of individual mandate. Forget the personal attacks it’s the economy stupid
1977 2018-01-06 23:53:06 Where did you reinvest? AI stocks? Not sure if a better bet than $gbtc
1978 2018-01-06 23:52:38 Mr. President, after the recent rollback of the Cole Memo, Sessions should step down.  Marijuana stocks lost big money because of his poor decision.  Bad for States Rights, bad for the GOP, bad for the economy, and very bad for this November.
1979 2018-01-06 23:50:32 Jobs are still gone (including your family making crap in China), wages still low, stocks are inflated by buying their own stocks, tax refirm@only benefits those who don’t need it and are therefore freeloading entitlements, Isis still exists

1983 2018-01-06 23:46:55 Well, if you ask a lot of crypto "traders", most don't hold BTC precisely because it's not volatile enough. When 4000% increases over a few weeks becomes the "norm", BTC starts to look a lot like large cap stocks
1984 2018-01-06 23:46:40 But what will inflation do to the woomy? Do we invest in woomy stocks?

2009 2018-01-06 23:40:26 I give thanks there's a bar in Indy that stocks Tank 7 on tap and has the Chiefs game on.
2010 2018-01-06 23:39:45 I just bought two stocks I don’t know how you guys do a 9-5
2011 2018-01-06 23:37:42 $PRED my entry was at 1.06 and sold at 2.25 my patience sucks. At least I made 100%. Hope to get back in.
2012 2018-01-06 23:37:29 Billions of dollars for you your family and friends, nothing helping the majority of Hardworking American Families. Most don't own any stocks. Puffing up on a daily basis means nothing to most of US, we are to busy busting our butts trying to make ends meet with a little leftover
2013 2018-01-06 23:37:02 #Cryptocurrency isn't like #stocks.  They are an #innovation onto themselves.  Focus on the #altcoins that have the most compelling #purpose.  Don't chase random ones because they are going up #bitcoin #2018

2015 2018-01-06 23:36:44 @1simpletrader can you find or have another chart like HTHT I’m trying to test waves on the stocks. And I found out that if you go back 3 waves the Fibonacci retracement hit almost perfect the 50%

2019 2018-01-06 23:28:48 When I first started I thought you had to put the hashtag in front but it is the $ sign. And for a company name use @. For the sector (e.g. lithium, crypto, blockchain) you use the # sign. Others helped me out so I’m paying it forward: )
2020 2018-01-06 23:28:18 Listen Genius. What have you done for us? Other than say we need to pass it before we read it. That’s like buying a car without driving it. See how that turned out? I lost my doc and premiums went up. Trump cut our taxes. Unemployment down. Stocks and 401K’s up. No Daca. Wall Yes
2021 2018-01-06 23:27:28 I’m trying to trade stocks with an app as  a step into getting it together
2022 2018-01-06 23:27:07 Here's how popular racing used to be in the 90's up here.

At Riverside Park, they had a completely separate division of street stocks specifically for police officers.  ...and that division used to pull like 20 cars each show.
2023 2018-01-06 23:25:47 Sure. Expensive and unique properties can be hard to find a buyer for. Plus the wealth estimates are usually done by journos who wouldn't know anything. Unless they are liquid stocks or a very recent transaction I ignore such estimates altogether.
2024 2018-01-06 23:25:28 Any thoughts or picks out of these stocks ?  $IFXY $OTTV $MPXEF $ERRB $MJOG $ANDI $AKER $NSPR $LVVV $CVO $GLNNF $PETZ $ITUS $WFT
2025 2018-01-06 23:25:16 Just wait until March 2018. Less than 50% of Americans own Stock. The W/H is full of Ex Financial Predators tied to the stock market. Most Stocks are owned by Foreign Countries, Mob, Corps & Russia PUTIN. Soon to take profits & We Get Screwed + Depression. Think?
2026 2018-01-06 23:24:16 Yep. I'm frightened he might escape w/ his son to my state .      
I must rush out to buy another gun, or 5. Definitely semi-automatics w/ bump stocks & hopefully some silencers (off the black market) this time! There's a new(ish?) automatic Glock I want too. 
2027 2018-01-06 23:22:15 This is all about you and the others getting richer. Yes,  stocks are up but the guy working at Arbys doesn't own stock.  Show me there jobs please. How much do they pay?
2028 2018-01-06 23:21:43 Ok, so some people are saying that a speculative mania in tokens is necessary because, as in the case of railroads and tech stocks, that mania built up the infrastructure upon which real innovation is built. Ok, fine, but...
2029 2018-01-06 23:18:25 You're part right. The dem's have nothing because they've learned nothing. Our economy is the opposite of amazing. The stock rise is fools gold caused by speculation and companies buying their own stocks, boosting the prices. No actual capital backing it.
2030 2018-01-06 23:18:25 The loyalty hotline even admitted that they have different inventories for New and Renewing. They don’t share stocks.
2031 2018-01-06 23:17:38 I for one did not ignore his tax cut for the richest 1% or the rise in stocks which I own none ! I haven’t not noticed his deregulating off shore drilling , boy lets live high fuck the rest to come ! He’s a Mobster!
2032 2018-01-06 23:17:01 He hasn’t been in office for a year yet, so comparing him to Obama at this point is irrelevant. After the devastation Bush and the Democratic led congress created Obama had no where to go but up and he did his best with socialist policies.  stocks do not define the economy
2033 2018-01-06 23:15:17 If you trust Wall st, stocks, 401s, etc tied to offshore mfg, tech, & finacial sectors are likely to prosper under Territorial Tax for now. Unfortunately/fortunately, territory tax is a scam to facilitate offshore mfg & tax havens that harms 95% of economy, thus subject to change
2034 2018-01-06 23:13:11 STELLA FACTION stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
2035 2018-01-06 23:12:30 I dont support tron, but that like 350%+ in 2-3days is why ppl are moving outta stocks and into crypto lol
2036 2018-01-06 23:11:34 If a company's stocks go up it usually means they are doing well, which benefits a lot of people, not just stock holders.
2037 2018-01-06 23:10:32 Of course rich people make stocks go up while the rest suffer! You will lose again!
2038 2018-01-06 23:10:27 I don't dabble in stocks but that sounds terrible.  At least not negative.
2039 2018-01-06 23:08:47 Or everyone complaining here could just buy stocks.
2040 2018-01-06 23:08:43 Many states are waiting for this to be considered legal. This could be the year.
2041 2018-01-06 23:08:29 I just lost hundreds in the market. 

"Stocks and mutual funds?"

No. Whole Foods. 
2042 2018-01-06 23:08:09 I need to win the lottery, or have my stocks sky rocket. Please and thank you.
2043 2018-01-06 23:06:56 Here’s a dose of reality for you Jake. The stocks and 401K’s are up. The unemployment and taxes are dropping. We are finally getting some positive things happening.
2044 2018-01-06 23:06:33 Stocks kick off the year at record highs, but some difficulty lies ahead, according to Federated's Phil Orlando.
2045 2018-01-06 23:06:14 Then why the tf are my stocks going down when I have the best of the best stocks?
2046 2018-01-06 23:05:35 Eric Holder is appealing to public to destroy best economy in decades for massive street protests . Keith Ellison aligning Democrats with terrorists. Media pundit forgoes 25% stocks gain do to anti Trump hysteria , Entertainment and sports stars unemployable. Who losing Minds?
2047 2018-01-06 23:05:33 Scanning back magazines from 1999, it was a full 6-8 months after Time got bullish cover did the market peak. This time around, after a 300% bubble-like rise, Time mag is still recommending selling stocks (!!!) 5/n

2049 2018-01-06 23:03:39 @Blizzard_Ent It is when that you make stocks for the shirts of @DallasFuel ?
2050 2018-01-06 23:03:36 I just consider it that way since I literally started investing last year and what could potentially be the top of this 8 year long bull market. But the way I go about picking my stocks is by reading annual reports of certain companies
2051 2018-01-06 23:03:31 People are citing a study and tweeting, "The wealthiest 10% of Americans own 84% of all stocks."
2052 2018-01-06 23:00:40 But where? Hope there's plenty of Rubicon stocks nearby.
2053 2018-01-06 23:00:32 Make it 3 players per team, two stocks.

That's how 3s does it and it's so good.
2054 2018-01-06 22:58:10 You realize Dow measures how rich companies are getting, not how well the average citizen is doing? Less than half the country is invested in stocks.
2055 2018-01-06 22:57:55 We finna be wearing reading glasses an teaching eachother about stocks
2056 2018-01-06 22:57:22 I see what you mean, but I am torn if we saw classic contrarian signals — sure there is bitcoin, semis which are flying off, but where is the Time mag coverage. Even their most recent business writer suggested selling stocks to be safe! 1/n
2057 2018-01-06 22:54:11 u ever get rly high and invest 300 dollars in stocks
2058 2018-01-06 22:52:58 So refs don’t know what a catch is, and now don’t know what a fumble is. @nfl laughing stocks.
2059 2018-01-06 22:52:38 Does this moron know that we were losing 750k jobs a month when O took over? Stocks were already breaking records, unemployment already low, jobs already gaining when Trump took over. These people are so disingenuous!
2060 2018-01-06 22:52:14 Down to my last @QuornFoods chorizo sausage that I've stored in the freezer and no where stocks them anymore  stop discontinuing products I like! Sort it out @QuornFoods

2062 2018-01-06 22:50:40 Am I the only one who wanna learn about cryptocurrency & marijuana stocks?
2063 2018-01-06 22:49:51 NEWSFLASH: to most of the rest of the world, we already *are* laughing stocks. If we pursue Brexit, they'll just laugh *more*; if we stop it, they'll just view it as a temporary aberration and in time, will laugh *with* us about the whole silly debacle.
2064 2018-01-06 22:49:19 Day 352 of American Carnage: Trump’s not smart. He’s, like, really smart. Trump’s not a genius. He’s a very stable genius. That’s why he gets that a reporter saying unflattering things on failing fake news no one watches makes millions of investors sell blue chip stocks and drive
2065 2018-01-06 22:49:03 The bigger question is how far can it fall, when it inevitably does.

Stocks have been soaring since 2010. It can't go on forever.
2066 2018-01-06 22:46:10 Does anybody know where to find detailed info on how U stocks performed during last bull mkt? Would like to assess sensitivity to U spot prices of individual names...
2067 2018-01-06 22:45:50 Both of these stocks are doing well - I assume they are on your radar for a few reasons
2068 2018-01-06 22:44:04 Things have surely improved for the private prison market since @byHeatherLong wrote this in 2/17: “stocks of the two biggest private prison operators—CoreCivic (formerly know as Corrections Corp. of America) and Geo Group—have doubled since election day.” Both big GOP donors.
2069 2018-01-06 22:43:44 Lol! It’s true though. What’s the first thing you do when you get a new iPhone? Delete stocks. And, don’t forget, sears and Kmart are crumbling smh
2070 2018-01-06 22:43:28 Hello! Thank you for the info. I hope that they still have stocks tho
2071 2018-01-06 22:43:22 Lol great. Now it’ll be on Fox News- “musk fails again, new roadster breaks down 9 people die in battery fire, stocks plummet, shareholders sell, no profits, reservation holders kill themselves!!!!”
2072 2018-01-06 22:42:54 When do u enter in contraction stocks generally?after box bo?
2073 2018-01-06 22:42:24 No that make people with stocks richer. Doesn't help main stream Americans at all. RESIGN and make America Great Again
2074 2018-01-06 22:40:53 Not everyone is heavily invested in stocks. And Republican "growth" usually results in some kind of crash the Democrats have to clean up.
2075 2018-01-06 22:40:47 Okay watch, Unemployment will continue to get lower, Illegal immigration will continue to go down, the GDP will continue to rise and the stocks will still break records.
2076 2018-01-06 22:39:26 But your own words are countering each other, what your saying is that due it Obama, everything is great, but if Trump was terrible, then Unemployment would be going up, illegal immigration would be going up, GDP would be going down and stocks would be terrible, but it’s not!
2077 2018-01-06 22:39:02 Which makes matches last even longer than they should with just two stocks, most of the time in this game you either die at 150+ or you get janked out at 50
2078 2018-01-06 22:38:16 How am i gonna sell my pack if yall keep bragging about using no stocks can yall chill real quick

2081 2018-01-06 22:36:51 I agree and i think smash 4 biggest problem is the ledge, more specifically ledgetrump, for me thats basically what broke the game. Its basically the reason rage is so strong, we r stuck on two stocks and you cant edgeguard certain characters & they live to high % s
2082 2018-01-06 22:33:52 Apparently several people in Mt. Liberty got bump stocks for xmas-yikes.
2083 2018-01-06 22:33:43 doesn't matter...both buy and sell stocks upticks, suggest increased volatility ahead...we shall see....
2084 2018-01-06 22:32:36 None of the coin trading apps are going to disrupt brokerages for trading stocks. I think you missed the point of my Tweet.
2085 2018-01-06 22:31:47 $IWM will trade above $160 before the end of this month. take it to the bank. #stocks
2086 2018-01-06 22:31:16 Sounds like you have no employment, stocks or 401k.  Thoes without  are the only people left who are crying.
2087 2018-01-06 22:31:05 But a whole bunch who don’t own stocks DO own jet skis, jacuzzi’s, luxury cars, 65” TVs, etc.. And many could buy stock at their place of work @ a discount to market price but don’t.
Choices are part of life.
Thank God their pensions do own stocks.
2088 2018-01-06 22:30:58 You own stocks?

2090 2018-01-06 22:30:28 Yeah I've been able to punish BW before but I've been bamboozled many times where I lose stocks/games to BW due to me either not expecting it to happen or not being able to react fast enough
2091 2018-01-06 22:28:13 If Congress got off their asses, bump stocks wouldn't be legal either. That applies to both Parties.
2092 2018-01-06 22:27:48 @Nationwide___  What a business you are running Nationwide,have been a customer a few yrs and no accidents cars getting older but yet my insuranve goes up at least $10.00 every 6 months?, was told it was because you lost $$ in stocks and wouldn't happen this year,well it did!.

2095 2018-01-06 22:26:31 S&P corps already bought back $800 billions of stocks in 2017 alone. Meaning they didn't know what to do with their cash. Buying back stocks was deemed a better use of it than investing, hiring or raising salaries. WTF do you think they're gonna do with even more cash?
2096 2018-01-06 22:26:30 Tsx venture, CBW. Potential to quadruple in next three months. Look at the other Canadian MJ stocks that were at $2 not that long ago.
2097 2018-01-06 22:25:14 Boiled rice? Come on stocks!
2098 2018-01-06 22:24:46 Finally sold these stocks that weren’t hitting on nunnnn. I think I wanna play w/ stocks this week or next week. I ain’t gon b doing too much of anything lol. 
2099 2018-01-06 22:24:11 Stocks are high because Obama economic turnaround + happy CEOs/wealthy after massive tax cuts promised for them and less regulation = more money for them to throw
2100 2018-01-06 22:23:39 Death in the Stocks was my first. I bought it because I liked the cover. It had me from the first page.
2101 2018-01-06 22:23:24 I concur! He has boosted the economy, raised the stocks in the market, stopped drawing a line w/ n. Korea and our jobs market and resale on homes is way up. The dems need to let go and start owning up to their crimes!
2102 2018-01-06 22:23:22 Anyone know of some good stocks to invest in with a quick return??
2103 2018-01-06 22:21:58 It's not just a Friday that they need the stocks full. Last time I looked, the counter is open 9-9 Mon-Sat and 10-4 on a Sunday. People buy pizzas during most of those periods.
2104 2018-01-06 22:21:40 So glad I sold my Disney stocks before this decline.

2106 2018-01-06 22:20:43 The conundrum, post non-commentary vid = slow views but very low risk of being demonetized, post commentary vid 100+ views first day but at high risk of getting demonetized.  I guess it is like play stocks, low risk, low yield vs high risk, high yield
2107 2018-01-06 22:20:38 RIPPLE XRP XRP= XRP/USD $USD  It doubled+ 2nd highest market cap, price, was $1.22, now $2.67 ~~> like penny stocks,

2109 2018-01-06 22:17:27 Stocks are taking off!  The market is doing great!  He inherited a functioning recovering economy. Do you recall the shit Storm Obama got handed?  Please. First year belongs to predecessor. But admittedly the rich are doing great!!

Or your coin is not similar to stocks having suh financial reports because it is just a work done by some developers(computer programmers)?
Thank You

2120 2018-01-06 22:09:04 Personally keeping a very close eye and prepared to bail if need be. Was planning on cashing out of MJ stocks in April or May (will keep some but likely sell 80%). Looking at expanding my shares of GAMR etf as well as some amazon and twitter.
2121 2018-01-06 22:08:14 I’ve invested in stocks and crypto currency as well as real estate. As of 1/6/18, buy TRX for $0.16. It will be worth it.

How did something like that go unnoticed? Imagine if you had alerted club members about Boeing the day before
2127 2018-01-06 22:06:24 Crypto I’m up 4x, options I haven’t done in a while but was averaging ~20-30% annualized, my stocks are outperforming the market ($AMZN) but not like crypto.

2131 2018-01-06 22:04:10 Love it !! Best president just check the stocks and job market. Small business thriving.
2132 2018-01-06 22:03:24 Yeah, more and more people are becoming aware of these stocks. The gains alone are enough to draw more people in. Could be enough to keep the train going. More good news coming out will for sure help, passing through the senate will be one of the last hurdles
2133 2018-01-06 22:03:18 Lol stocks bubba
2134 2018-01-06 22:02:03 these stocks will survive, comeback to prosper and make you money
2135 2018-01-06 22:01:19 I like having both. I like the flexibility to invest in things not offered in the TSP (emerging markets and individual stocks, as an example). I’m unlikely to need the pre-59.5 qualified distributions or principal withdrawals, but nice it is there.
2136 2018-01-06 21:59:40 These numbers do not, by and large, help the middle class or the working poor, since they do not own stocks. Show numbers that reflect economic policies that help those 2 groups. Since you are geared to show numbers that benefit Trump, you are probably not set up for that.
2137 2018-01-06 21:59:04 $xrp $btc omg, there is a coin called bitcoinx2 seriously, who comes up with these names. Like stocks, there are plenty of crap stocks and thus crap coins.
2138 2018-01-06 21:58:04 I’m more disturbed by the republicans in congress than Trump. They should be the ones investigated. How did they make their millions? What stocks or land deals have they made?

After reading @heiseonline about #Meltdown & #Spectre I know: I will neither touch Intel CPU nor Intel stocks ;-)
2145 2018-01-06 21:54:18 Great news for people who play the stocks. I hope your retirement plan's not tied to it. It can be great but also very devastating.
2146 2018-01-06 21:53:36 This is fuckin great!! You’re Beast without stocks
2147 2018-01-06 21:52:14 Hey Fake President, most Americans are not in the stock market.  80% of stocks are owned by only 10% of the wealthiest Americans!
2148 2018-01-06 21:51:32 S&P 500 companies bought back 800 billions of stocks in 2017. They can't find a better use of their cash. They will get even more cash with the new bill. Tax cut would certainly help SME and middle class but why not focus the bill on them instead of the big corps and 1%ers?
2149 2018-01-06 21:51:08 we are trying a lower meat/dairy approach to our eating so I am experimenting a lot with more veges, legumes etc. Tonight I am going to make a broccoli soup for dinner. Also I have been making vege stocks which I think I have gotten good at too if u want a few tips
2150 2018-01-06 21:49:51 The 401 k has been going up for years that’s why Oboma gets such  respect.  The people who don’t respect him think Trump has fixed the stocks lol.  He’s destroyed America’s credibility and has stolen over a trillion dollars for his rich friends.  Give it Time. You’ll see

2154 2018-01-06 21:48:19 I want to learn about stocks!!!
2155 2018-01-06 21:47:39 Stocks have continuously broken records for years. If anything Trump is destabilizing.
2156 2018-01-06 21:47:26 GOP: Health Insurance, Abortion, Bump Stocks, Prayer in schools, legal age for cigarettes and drinking should all be decided by the state...except Marijuana for some stupid reason.
2157 2018-01-06 21:47:12 Casino stocks returned over 50% gains over the same period.
2158 2018-01-06 21:46:57 Thinking that this runaway $SPY $ES_F train is really just wild inflation caused by QE. We cant have widespread inflation because the QE never made it to all those people who dont hold financial assets, and there really isnt anywhere else for the $ to go other than more stocks
2159 2018-01-06 21:46:38 Agreed. Crypto is obviously different than traditional stocks, where that would be a flashing signal, but I was in at $10 so why risk it 
2160 2018-01-06 21:45:42 Good point.  Then the #shitcoins can do reverse splits just like the shit pink sheets and otc stocks do....funny shit
2161 2018-01-06 21:44:22 The relative uptick in stocks has nothing to do with Trump being smart or not. Try again.

I said buy weed stocks in 2016 and y’all ain’t listen
2167 2018-01-06 21:40:13 1. False. Tax cut will mostly profit companies who are already have so much money they don't know what to do with it except buying back stocks, and the 0.1%, but will massively increase the debt. 
3. Barely, if not, while increasing risk of environment disaster.
2168 2018-01-06 21:38:10 I wonder if the stocks of snack companies will be impacted?
2169 2018-01-06 21:38:05 After the crazy orange haired idiot in the oval office made us laughing stocks, all Republicans will lose their seat and there are a few that will face Treason. Kasich is also one of them..... Vote Democratic

2172 2018-01-06 21:35:41 Finally someone who understands markets don’t respond to policy quickly. You’re also one of the first people to mention international stocks. Well said. 
2173 2018-01-06 21:35:31 Large percent of people who have stocks are foreigners or foreugn corporations. Lot of wealth is going overseas with the #taxscam

2176 2018-01-06 21:34:24 Not only that, need patience, many of those bank stocks rebounded and then some since then.
2177 2018-01-06 21:34:05 Yes but you are better of thinking about the hated stocks... That’s where the bargains are likely to be.
2178 2018-01-06 21:32:29 Bump stocks make semiautomatics fully automatic doe!!!!
2179 2018-01-06 21:31:59 Most penny stocks are scams anyways I just wanted one last pop before it gets r/s.

2184 2018-01-06 21:29:09 Yeah, every smart person I know goes around telling people how smart they are. Trump's been doing that for 40 years.

He got to where he is via inheritance, luck and being an asshole.

(He's actually lost money against index over the decades. He'd have more if it was in stocks)
2185 2018-01-06 21:29:08 Anything that isn't a mutual fund counts against the 1%. I've got some individual stocks, options trades, and cryptocurrency.

2191 2018-01-06 21:23:04 Completely agree. Do your DD, keep doing your DD, have faith in it and don’t get caught up in chasing other stocks. I learned that from a friend here as well as experience. I also don’t know a great deal about $Idk though I’m going to do more research on it.
2192 2018-01-06 21:22:24 Now, if only I can get @tomellis17 as the groom and @TheEllenShow to officiate, I'll be able to use my poor stocks to the fullest extent. Whoopee!

2196 2018-01-06 21:20:48 10% of Americans own over 80% of stocks.  Its not a broad economic indicator. But hey, as a Trumpkin, you could care less about facts
2197 2018-01-06 21:18:39 stocks

2199 2018-01-06 21:16:54 Okay, that's interesting. How do you pick your stocks then?
2200 2018-01-06 21:16:42 @RainbowGluttony || Hey Stocks? Can I send a starter?
2201 2018-01-06 21:15:51 today i was on the phone with my dad & he was lecturing me about stocks so I told him I had to go (after 45 min!!) & then i called my mom to tell her about an actress i saw last night but SHE PUT ME BACK ONT EHP HONE WITH MY DAD #BETRAYAL
2202 2018-01-06 21:15:49 The top 1% of America owns 50% of investment assets. (stocks, etc). The poorest half of America owns just .5% of the investments.
2203 2018-01-06 21:14:46 @Jimmypisfunny I understand your need for cue cards. Everyone but cue card stocks, I forsee a sudden influx soon.
2204 2018-01-06 21:14:11 It wont be those supporting #Remain who will be laughing stocks... it will be those who vigorously promoted #Brexit. I'd prefer to bring back the village stocks for them & put all the rotting farm produce to use but if not, then public ridicule will do just fine.
2205 2018-01-06 21:12:54 Another comment on the stock market. Many large cap stocks are not even close  to the highs the Indi's are making. The tech stocks are the market leaders and have bulging p/e's that are not worth the risk but are momentum driven. Someone will get the haircut.
2206 2018-01-06 21:12:20 Sorry for the misunderstanding. I was supporting your point because of how a lot of the richer people will find ways to manipulate the tax brackets so that they are paying less for their stocks.
2207 2018-01-06 21:12:09 So you think the stock market busting 25K is disastrous?  I hope you sold all your stocks.  Not right for you to benefit with all the good he is doing while you have that crappy attitude.
2208 2018-01-06 21:10:43 Not if they are invested in stocks.
2209 2018-01-06 21:09:59 @jimcramer hey Cramer! Happy New Years! I’m fairly new to Alibaba and have been doing well for such an early investment over some shares I own. What do u say about Alibaba? Buy or sell? Any forecasting! #stocks #alibaba
2210 2018-01-06 21:08:22 This is how it works with stocks, now they're doing it with cryptocurrency. "Price of fame." Of course, there's rules against this sort of thing with stocks (idk re. crypto since it's "quasi-regulated"), but naturally there's also very large loopholes to those rules. Corruption.
2211 2018-01-06 21:08:21 And that my dear if the funny part of his demented following.stocks rose because he’s screwing his blind followers on tax and income and they cheer him.  He even Brags he is making rich richer and they cheer.   No way I understand it.
2212 2018-01-06 21:07:20 Because real people dgas about the market. He want raises sonwe can afford groceries not stocks. SMH it's a going to crash anyways what's the point?
2213 2018-01-06 21:07:06 Besides diversification, there's little reason to spend time and money trading stocks when the potential profit of #cryptocurrency trading rivals a futures account on margin.  Restricted trading hours can't compete with decentralization!
2214 2018-01-06 21:06:17 The latest brexit wheeze going around by brextremists is we can't stop brexit now as we'll look like laughing stocks.

Erm

So in the absence of any reason for brexit, we should pursue is so we're not embarrassed.

That's it folks.

What a fnck up.

2216 2018-01-06 21:05:34 Stocks have been on a tear ever since President Trump surprised the political world with an election victory on Nov. 8, 2016. In fact, on the one-year anniversary of Trump’s win, the Dow has booked its best-ever first year under a new administration since 1945.

Surely a prudent man ensures all in his household have sufficient means before donating to other households.

2220 2018-01-06 21:02:43 try index funds with vanguard.  An easy way to get into stocks
2221 2018-01-06 21:00:21 We have the worst influx of deadly drugs--heroin and fentanyl--in the history of our country. From China. While unemployment is low, and stocks (1% and foreign wralth) high, wages stay low. How does this help average American?
2222 2018-01-06 21:00:05 The best stocks in 2017 did about 100-130% return in a year...a fuckin year... lol.
2223 2018-01-06 20:58:38 64% bullish on stocks but 85% bearish on bonds? 
2224 2018-01-06 20:57:24 You must have bought spaghetti stocks in advance
2225 2018-01-06 20:57:20 The rich get richer- but really only on paper, unless they are selling those stocks, the market is only as good as the speculation in it
2226 2018-01-06 20:56:08 “VERY successful businessman” from the trust fund baby who declared bankruptcy 6 times...and didn’t you have to borrow more money from your family TWICE after losing everything, and wouldn’t you be worth about 4x’s as much if you had just put your original trust fund into stocks?

2231 2018-01-06 20:51:35 Yes the numbers are good, but you are riding on Obama's coattails.  The economy has been on a steady upward swing since he stopped the recession with his stimulus package.  Also poor and middle class people don't generally gamble on stocks.
2232 2018-01-06 20:51:09 From some research, a day trader basically ends the day with no stocks but only a cash position. They buy & sell the exact amount of positions. I may be off a bit but I think that's the gist of it. #WildCardLive
2233 2018-01-06 20:50:05 These attacks were true, thats the dif. Thats why thier stocks will continue to drop, unlike you most ppl don't like being lied to
2234 2018-01-06 20:48:35 Trading successfully doesn´t work if you think that education alone will be enough! You need to learn about yourself, you need to control your emotions, you NEED to know yourself to know how to trade #stocks #trading #Pennystocks #StockMarket #lifestyle #Power #KNOWLEDGE

2236 2018-01-06 20:47:29 MONEY CAN'T GET HIM OUT. BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE WHO INVEST IN HIM. MAY TAKE A DEVASTATE LOST. IF HE IS DISCREDITED. INVESTORS WOULD BAIL OUT. THEIR STOCKS WILL DROP. CREATING A FINANCIAL LOSS. THAT'S BUSINESS. EVEN TO KEEP A LOSER IN PLACE, TO SAVE FACE..
2237 2018-01-06 20:47:08 Money, or people with $, will always find the best return. When the economy is slow & there is no inflation to push usage of the money now. The money will go to assets that have a greater return than the general economy. That's why stocks,bonds & property values are skyrocketing.
2238 2018-01-06 20:45:32 Our PRESIDENT is busy, doing his job..not interviews. .Sorry, no punches.

2243 2018-01-06 20:40:48 The Stock Market has now gone 385 days without falling 5% or more. Longest streak on record. The last three occasions where this similarity happened, the market dropped an average of 8.7% over the next 30 to 40 days. #Stocks #StockMarket

2253 2018-01-06 20:33:19 Anyone who follows stocks closely knows, the market bottomed in March 2009 and has been off to the races ever since.  The O bull market=140% rise. In reality he doesn't deserve all the credit, just like you don't. Intelligence plays a factor in understanding.

2269 2018-01-06 20:20:15 Buy some stocks that you personally believe in / think have a terrific future and hold for the long term. Don’t trade in and out.

2292 2018-01-06 20:06:52 Stock market tops 25,000. Trump takes credit. Not so fast. Low interest rates make stocks whose dividends provide higher yields a better investment than bonds. A sound economy from Great Recession recovery provides more savings to invest. Thus, 25,000.
2293 2018-01-06 20:05:30 Just keep in mind the top 10% of the wealthiest own roughly 80% of all stocks. Might help explain why the Dow keeps increasing and middle-class wages remain in stagnation

2303 2018-01-06 20:00:02 Stock market is a small indicator of the overall health of this country.  Many industries are tanking, retail is suffering with layoffs and closures nationwide.  Stocks love deregulation.  How many of Trump supporters even own stocks?  Big tax break ( fraudulent) driving it up.
2304 2018-01-06 19:59:49 As noted, the divisor doesn't count for a given company's shares, it's only applied to the sum of one share of each of those thirty companies *once.* If one of those stocks splits, it may adjust -- But it is applied *once.* To that singular sum. That's *it.*
2305 2018-01-06 19:58:11 Therefore logically impossible for Trump to take ALL credit for events of last 12m as longer term trends like rising stocks already in place since GFC!
2306 2018-01-06 19:58:09 If you believe that then you need to invest in bank stocks

2308 2018-01-06 19:57:24 Stocks, bonds, gold, oil, REITS are all above 200 dma and USD is below. Fed induced coupling will continue until it doesn't. Your charts are still fabulous.
2309 2018-01-06 19:57:17 But look at two of the Dow stocks. How many outstanding shares of IBM are there? About 925 million. JPMorgan Chase? 3.4 billion. What does this mean to the Dow? FUCK ALL. A share is a share, no matter how many you have. The divisor is the blunt instrument of adjustment for this.

2318 2018-01-06 19:47:30 How is it then that the left and the media had a Meltdown over the 401k contribution provision in the tax plan? Oh wait, because when they were fighting it, it would hurt all the workers with 401ks who by default own stocks...
2319 2018-01-06 19:46:20 He’s gonna buy us all stocks.  Wow.  American WILL be great.
2320 2018-01-06 19:45:39 Its definitely legal in the crypto market ain’t stocks
2321 2018-01-06 19:44:23 This market's rise is simple issue of supply and more supply.

There's s a limited supply of stock..
There's a greater supply of cash...

The limited supply of stock keeps shrinking with buybacks.

Supply of cash keeps growing with central bank printing.

2336 2018-01-06 19:33:22 I own some $SX, a fairly small position relatively speaking, and am considering selling other stocks, which still have a lot of potential, to buy some more $SX. Am I crazy? Am I wrong? Did I miss the boat on $SX? Is $IDK likely to be as big as $SX? What's the play here?
2337 2018-01-06 19:32:26 Actually there is enough money in the world to pay everyone. If tron is the new internet's platform, 100 bn coins for every transaction on it won't even seem like close to enough. Market cap for coins isn't the same as stocks. Do some research.
2338 2018-01-06 19:32:08 Smart ppl can see the faith in Trump,  day one stocks went up,  he created these jobs by cutting regulations and taxes.  Hilarious ppl try to give credit to Obama when the economy tanked during his years 
2339 2018-01-06 19:31:49 Jace can flip the turn after you play it for no real investment other than playing the game, and stocks the graveyard for built-in synergy.
2340 2018-01-06 19:31:48 I trade some crypto but I still don’t enjoy it as much as stocks and options.
2341 2018-01-06 19:31:39 It never trickles down because they either put their money in offshore havens and stockpile it, throw it in stocks which helps stocks but not the economic impact of working and middle class people, or give it to rich CEOs who then stockpile it in offshore havens.
2342 2018-01-06 19:30:54 Bitch, stick to Smash 4, and losing by 4 stocks
2343 2018-01-06 19:29:47 This is pretty bad. Setting up an org you fund to sue an entity you own stocks in is a flagrant conflict of interest. [Bet against those stocks or insure them if you know poss. outcomes.] But hey, what's a little fraud between Clinton donors, right? The hubris is off the charts..
2344 2018-01-06 19:28:43 It will hardly come from those people, though. No change or real innovation has come from them. Have you given a look at SDL stocks recently? And others of the like?
2345 2018-01-06 19:28:26 DM for local supplies to all major towns in Kenya. Hurry up while stocks last!!!
#UltimateComicKE
2346 2018-01-06 19:27:58 Shulk just doesn't have gimmicks to take stocks
2347 2018-01-06 19:27:57 Once weed is legalized (which I am for)... actual fundamentals will kick in and then let’s see if the prices of the weed stocks stay this high? Hit me up after August let’s see what happens?
2348 2018-01-06 19:26:33 84% of all stocks are owned by the top 10%. Less than 3% of stocks are owned by the bottom 30%. Those are crumbs from massah's table, make no mistake about it. The working class is about to lose everything they think they have, and most of them are clueless. There will be blood.
2349 2018-01-06 19:26:09 Depriving excess cash a place to park in bonds, pushed money into real estate & stocks.
2350 2018-01-06 19:26:01 @WeekendInvestng Trending on social media. kal tak 10k followers ho jayenge 
2351 2018-01-06 19:25:27 in stocks???
2352 2018-01-06 19:25:00 85% of all stocks are owned by the top 10% of incomes.  If Bitcoin fails, and that bubble will burst, only the rich will suffer.
2353 2018-01-06 19:23:42 @TottyAlts pon stocks
2354 2018-01-06 19:22:53 Sus baka out of stocks na ta haha
2355 2018-01-06 19:20:20 The value went up in the stocks
2356 2018-01-06 19:20:17 How about @jeffsessions causing a billion dollar panic (stocks, jobs, state tax money) with his outdated pot views no state AG is gonna support and the American people overwhelmingly are against?
2357 2018-01-06 19:19:37 I trade stocks, you buy and sell those numbers on the screen
2358 2018-01-06 19:17:34 Exactly keep #Lithium and #graphite stocks on radar they are on momentum mode
2359 2018-01-06 19:16:36 Jeff Sessions really screwed my marijuana stocks, now I have 2 reasons to hate that asshole
2360 2018-01-06 19:15:20 Boasting about the stock market soaring All that's doing is making the Wealthiest Americans wealthier. It has absolutely no effect on the average hardworking American people and Families. Most don't own stocks living on trust funds passed down from Generations.
2361 2018-01-06 19:15:09 Not all will hire! Most Corporations asked said that they plan on reinvesting in their company & purchase stocks! AT&T are actually laying off many people!
2362 2018-01-06 19:14:45 So very happy my poor stock went up! I can now buy property on the moon! And get that unicorn I always wanted! And have that extravagant white wedding in Hollywood I always wanted. Now, I just need to find a groom, which should be easy cuz my poor person stocks went up!
2363 2018-01-06 19:14:30 “In #business: #stsrtup #small-biz #entrepreneur #tech #wob . Dow surged more than 200 points , caps off the best #running start to the year since #2006 .”

2365 2018-01-06 19:13:11 Now u absolutely lack sanity!! Let’s be clear!! Now th stock mrkt is doing well, you re taking credit for it yeah! 

Pls be ready to take the responsibility when things go wrong with stocks and don’t play the blame games you re known for !!
2366 2018-01-06 19:12:46 Actually they will buy their own stocks back give bonuses to write off at the end of the year
2367 2018-01-06 19:12:28 I thought this wasn't relevant to my work, then @alisonglaurence talked about the paleontologist Osborn met with the immigration society in 1923 about keeping racial stocks pure. Will have to go look at those transcripts. #aha18 #s218
2368 2018-01-06 19:11:43 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2369 2018-01-06 19:11:42 I can honestly say, I’m really happy for @buffalobills And @Jaguars And their fans! I may be a @Colts fans! And would love to see them win every year! But, it’s good for business when the laughing stocks and also rans rise up! Maybe in the year 2140 @Browns fans will get theirs
2370 2018-01-06 19:10:47 From people like you who aren’t honest with themselves. Have you not done well for yourself when it comes to the stocks?
2371 2018-01-06 19:10:26 Yes, but many, if not most, companies are giving that money to execs and buying back stocks, not giving it to their lowest paid employees where it would do the most good. Ultimately what will drive up wages is the near full employment economy created by President Obama.
2372 2018-01-06 19:09:26 GLOBAL STOCKS START YEAR WITH A BANG WITH STOCKS AROUND THE WORLD. NEW RECORDS
S&P 500 INDEX IS THE MOST OVERBOUGHT
THE CRB INDEX MAY BE NEARING AN UPSIDE BREAKOUT
THAT WOULD SIGNAL HIGHER INFLATION WHICH COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS LATER IN THE YEAR
GOLD AND ITS MINERS MAY BE BOTTOMING
2373 2018-01-06 19:08:31 Let's not forget garic and the scraps of whatever fresh herbs I've got lying around.

Today I had half a bunch of curly parsley so I used that.

I don't mind going to FLAVOR COUNTRY with my stocks, but some people like to keep them blander so they're more "versatile".
2374 2018-01-06 19:05:59 Low for whom? Are you a multi-millionaire? Most people don't own stocks. They will rely on medicare however. And everyone relys on a stable world from fit leadership. #StableGenius
2375 2018-01-06 19:05:56 I heard more than 1/3 of #NYSE stocks are owned by foreign nationals That's where tax breaks are going too
So much 4 the "America First" policy?
2376 2018-01-06 19:05:06 No shit buying stocks in 2009 was a good idea!  

That doesn’t make Obama a financial nor economic genius.
2377 2018-01-06 19:05:00 My local Co-op only stocks the beef flavour Monster Munch. Pickled Onion is a special treat, when I can find it
2378 2018-01-06 19:02:23 Je l'avais pas trouvé à la Fnac de Lyon, mais ils doivent en avoir de nouveaux stocks.
2379 2018-01-06 19:01:09 Je liquide mes stocks pour 2018
2380 2018-01-06 19:00:44 I like the cheaper(affordable) stocks. One reason I like crpto is you can buy a fraction of a coin. You cant buy .000156329 of Amazon.
2381 2018-01-06 18:59:59 & your big agenda, AT&T to layoff 1,000’s so down goes your jobs! & soon there will be a market drop when company’s start selling off stocks to line their pockets.
2382 2018-01-06 18:59:35 The richest 10% of Americans own 84%-94% of all stocks. Remember that next time you hear republican propaganda about how Trump is so great because of market performances.
2383 2018-01-06 18:58:19 Hopefully I'm not late to the game, I just put orders to invest in 3 Canadian cannabis stocks. Go get high #Canada
2384 2018-01-06 18:57:44 A dart throwing monkey could have done well in 2017. No, make it - A dart throwing monkey would have done far better than a risk averse investor. Deflates your ego balloon when you realize a portfolio of randomly picked stocks would have outperformed most investors
2385 2018-01-06 18:56:28 Unless you make over $175,000 you are not getting a tax cut, unless you consider $8.00 a week a wndfall. The wall won't be built unless you want to pay for it out of your $8.00 tax cut, & less than 30% of Americans are invested in stocks, meaning most don't have 401ks. Head, ass.

2391 2018-01-06 18:54:32 You need stocks in socks!
2392 2018-01-06 18:52:52 Oh no! Hope you find a Chemist that stocks the flu remedies.
2393 2018-01-06 18:50:28 Best economy in years and lowest unemployment in years also I bet you have not sold any stocks lately. So let's just roll with it for a while. You guys can ruin the country later.
2394 2018-01-06 18:50:20 These new hair straighteners are doing a pretty good job at ironing my hunting stocks 
2395 2018-01-06 18:49:28 The Stock Market Increase is not only for those who own stocks but the added wealth allows for Companies to increase spending and investment, hence increase GDP, wages and jobs. It helps all and so sad an American spins it otherwise!!
2396 2018-01-06 18:47:14 Deadass just disassociated because the stock market is closed and I didn’t realize today was the weekend and it’s only noon and also weird as fuck that I am into stocks now who am I what is this fucking life
2397 2018-01-06 18:46:54 I do own stocks, but not enough to matter. Just enough to feel part of the game. I do it so I get the annual reports. That way I can see how they're screwing us little people or plundering our planet.
2398 2018-01-06 18:45:52 Economy hasn't raged for us. Benefits are raging for all the corporations and billionaires, therefore stocks are climbing (for now). You are a Trump fox news lying suck up. It's been PROVEN Russia interfered and obvious in our faces what republicans are doing to obstruct. Go away
2399 2018-01-06 18:44:35 Sure, that's why dividend stocks are great. They double pay in effect. It's if you're in retirement, they allow you to draw p payment by way of dividend while still reinvesting the interest the mutual fund interest.
2400 2018-01-06 18:43:31 Because all those poor people have stocks.   Only people really benefiting are you and your rich friends
2401 2018-01-06 18:43:09 PROGRESSIVE ALLIANCE stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
2402 2018-01-06 18:42:57 Yay! Thanks love 
2403 2018-01-06 18:42:51 That's a reverse split with stocks and Every time a reverse split happens to a company the stock price drops. So I'm not sure if the same thing would happen in crypto's
2404 2018-01-06 18:42:25 Okie dear.. 
2405 2018-01-06 18:42:02 Weather, Energy and Financial Services( Commodities, stocks, anomalies)
2406 2018-01-06 18:41:49 Well at least it’s good thing u can  pick stocks, lol
2407 2018-01-06 18:41:00 I don’t know that the senate carry out stocks that.
2408 2018-01-06 18:40:33 I dont have to come back. We are already seeing results. A month ago, Schumer said (paraphrase) “ no business will raise wages, only buyback stocks/issue dividends”. Meanwhile , in 5 days, 1 million Americans so far got bonuses worth $1 billion. Along with raising wages/taxes cut
2409 2018-01-06 18:39:45 Just buy stocks lol
2410 2018-01-06 18:39:01 Some stocks run up driven by fundamental
Some stocks run up driven by bull market.
Second line stocks always having huge risk @AkhilAjithNair1 @porinju @drvijaymalik
2411 2018-01-06 18:38:22 That's still more productive than me, I've scrolled all of Instagram and Pinterest and slowly depleted the chocolate stocks in our house...it has been a weird day!
2412 2018-01-06 18:37:36 As a stock investor I can't wait for this Monday to see my stocks in the green
#trading #stocks #investing #invest #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #green
2413 2018-01-06 18:37:19 Me want!
2414 2018-01-06 18:37:16 @TopAchat  Ducoup les stocks des vega 56 sont épuisés en même pas 24H. Il y en aura d'autre ou l'edition limité est fini ? x)
2415 2018-01-06 18:37:06 The AG @jeffsessions should not be allowed to own stocks in private prisons. Cronyism and corruption abound in @realDonaldTrump admin.
2416 2018-01-06 18:36:31 R They goin to classical - if we can say it after this #blockchain madness on many stocks - move - Great Great up (8x), some down (-40%), up (20%), consolidste 4 3 Days, and again up 2x 4 new highs and then tug of war? $cnet
2417 2018-01-06 18:35:35 Equities aren't necessarily bad.  But dividend-paying stocks and never sell them.
2418 2018-01-06 18:35:07 It is not real estate, stocks, mutual funds, businesses, or money that makes a person rich. It is information, knowledge, wisdom, and know-how, aka financial intelligence, that’s makes one wealthy. -Robert Kiyosaki
2419 2018-01-06 18:34:45 It's praying on the desperate. Look at Sykes, guy earns millions per year on hawking shit seminars on pump and dump penny stocks, but I guess it only takes 1k people to pay you 100 per month. Not hard to achieve.
2420 2018-01-06 18:34:39 You’d have to dig pretty hard to find anything this Administration is doing to hurt stocks or the economy! #FakeNews #MAGA
2421 2018-01-06 18:34:18 But private prison stocks are his joy of the day.
2422 2018-01-06 18:32:44 @funder WOW ! You actually fell for that crap? What's wrong with you man? Next time get off your ass & do some REAL research ! You help make the left liberals laughing stocks around the world ! GET A GRIP PLEASE !
2423 2018-01-06 18:30:35 And 35% of stocks are owned by offshore investors who are taking our tax cut money to THEIR banks- no jobs there!
2424 2018-01-06 18:30:11 If you didn’t get sent the instructions for the FREE TRIAL let me know. All should have been received by now. Stocks and options
2425 2018-01-06 18:29:37 Visionaries from @intel to sell stocks before the crisis. No answer to our questions. If we have a CPU in guarantee, do we have the right to get a new one? One of the biggest security failure and no word from the company, just saving their money. #shameofintel
2426 2018-01-06 18:28:59 What game was you at pal? Stocks did what he had too but wasn’t overly busy, as kept in game suggests
2427 2018-01-06 18:28:37 Opportunity wise? Lets just say I pulled nearly all my net worth out of equities and put it here a few months back.  And I haven't traded stocks at work actively in months, yet I'm glued to my screen 15 hours a day watching this.
2428 2018-01-06 18:28:26 I  started saying “ya basic!” like they do in Brooklyn 99 while playing Pokémon with Hayden and now he’s doing it every time he lays down a basic Pokémon. We started a game and he stocks his bench all like “Ya basic! Ya basic! Ya basic!” 
2429 2018-01-06 18:28:18 Hey jackass!! The working poor don't own stocks. They work multiple jobs and still qualify for assistance! The Republican party is completely out of touch with the people who work the hardest and have the least. Congrats on being worthless!!
2430 2018-01-06 18:27:35 Hey Hamill, we didn't elect a "statesman". We elected a businessman who gets things done. Maybe not eloquent, but how's your stocks doing? Stick to "acting".
2431 2018-01-06 18:27:14 @investornoobz I agree. Which is a big reason why my retirement accounts are nearly 30% financial stocks right now
2432 2018-01-06 18:26:40 1. Least number of jobs created since 2011
2. More jobs outsourced 2017 than 2016
3. Number of illegals been on the decline since 2012. More leaving than coming
4. 54% of people don't own stocks, so it's not a good indicator for the health of the economy

Economy is not "ripping"
2433 2018-01-06 18:26:36 Absolutely!! I have been buying SOME of the stocks in this list heavily in last 1 year!! And let us see the next 3 year CAGR! :)
2434 2018-01-06 18:26:16 Better drop or seriously watch your @intel and @AMD stocks. Scary when @intel CEO drops $24mil
2435 2018-01-06 18:26:15 The entire @GOP is going down in history as pathetic, complicit, cowardly laughing-stocks who enabled the Mad King to burn the country to the ground. Unreal.
2436 2018-01-06 18:26:03 Not sure what your point is, sounds like your whining but I don’t know why. If you want stocks go purchase some. If you want to live in a socialist country then move. #URResponsible4U
2437 2018-01-06 18:25:39 Yes, I am trying hard to be sensible and keep biscuit stocks within reasonable limits. Just been given Mum’s Christmas surplus which will keep the office tin going for a while (giant Victoria selection plus double pack of Jaffa cakes) #thearchers
2438 2018-01-06 18:25:36 True... and the we look at our goalkeeping stocks and wonder where did the profits go? Which baseball superstar did they fund for FSG?
2439 2018-01-06 18:24:51 What I want is not just #money but the #time to spend that money. #stocks #stockmarket #stocktrading #trading #trader #investor #investing
2440 2018-01-06 18:24:25 All this time you been talking about the stocks being up and now you say they went down 350 points because of a News personality ,you are such a liar Potus you will go down in history as the biggest lying President in history 
2441 2018-01-06 18:23:53 Quit investing in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or good and growing stocks. Invest in og mc names.
2442 2018-01-06 18:23:39 ぴえええあついぴえええ
2443 2018-01-06 18:23:14 Thank you. Also do you make watchlists on which stocks you will be watching the next day and give it to your subscribers?
2444 2018-01-06 18:22:01 For profit prisons is why. It's a disgusting industry and no one should be able to make money buying and selling prison company stocks. Mr Sessions himself is an investor.
2445 2018-01-06 18:21:26 If he was in the finance system, he would find ways to manipulate penny stocks for fun and profit. As it is, he only a failure real estate developer and clown reality TV star.
2446 2018-01-06 18:21:01 Someone tell imbecile Dworkin that tens of millions of Americans have 401K's that are invested in diversified stocks and have been very positively impacted by the gains in the stock market.  Stop the class war socialist BS. America = Free Market Capitalism: Strong Economy = GOOD
2447 2018-01-06 18:20:39 and that helps me how?  If you can't afford stocks,  this is meaningless.   We both know that no one Stoll be creating more jobs or giving raises as a result of this. Stop lying!
2448 2018-01-06 18:20:16 I will give one example of what happened during recession in CA. People lost houses & jobs. When economy rebounded guess who had money to buy houses? The wealthy from stocks etc. & they all bought more than one house & there is shortage of housing for lower classes now #wealthgap
2449 2018-01-06 18:19:53 Low Base effects and the fact that zim stocks were priced in the worlds resece currency helped!
2450 2018-01-06 18:19:30 After 40% of the money has gone to taxes, I would put the rest in stocks, IRA, and mutual funds. Support my mom. Give back to particular charities, as well, pay up all my bills.
2451 2018-01-06 18:18:36 Nick recorded sweat at DAW stocks .
2452 2018-01-06 18:18:35 & 4 ns that do have stocks through 41Ks, he signed a EO rescinding the fiduciary rule for retirement accounts

2453 2018-01-06 18:18:25 I agree - there has to be a healthy balance. I am a biz owner & will benefit. But willy nilly deregulation will not translate into reducing wealth gap. Our ultimate goal should be lasting solution to reduce gap. Also what percent in red states or lower middle class own stocks?
2454 2018-01-06 18:17:07 so if stocks are high doesn't that mean they are more expensive? How does it help?
2455 2018-01-06 18:16:56 Regarding inflation, can you help me understand what’s causing the current asset bubble? Stocks and housing and whatnot. Are these inflated prices caused by too much money in circulation, poor distribution of money or something else?
2456 2018-01-06 18:16:27 You're doing twitter right
2457 2018-01-06 18:15:30 Why didn't we keep jacoby if JG was getting traded for a crumb? QBs stocks are very high, look what the eagles gave up for wentz, this is unbill like, his MO is to move guys on early.. ie mankins, I'm convinced he wanted to keep JG
2458 2018-01-06 18:15:10 You know the majority of Americans own no stocks right?!
2459 2018-01-06 18:15:04 Eat out for less in Lancashire's best restaurants with 2BR! The Strawberry Duck is offering you the chance to get £30 off your bill for just £15! While stocks last. #2BR #ProperlocalRadio #BestRestaurants #EatOutForLess
2460 2018-01-06 18:14:49 Over 80% of Americans depend on stocks directly or indirectly.

2463 2018-01-06 18:13:06 @katienolan don't be a hypocrite. Sell any stocks you have in the market. Move to Canada. After all, if it is so bad, get the EFF out and let the rest of us enjoy the United States of America. Get out if your 401k since you are so effing smart.
2464 2018-01-06 18:12:18 Just sucks that millions per year are taken from “monthly fees” and you guys aren’t top not traffic control. Y’all knew these stocks were of epic proportions. Rbc employee mentioned they were told to defer marijuana stock talk to customers. Y’all knew.

2467 2018-01-06 18:09:42 Huge divergence between Greek gov bonds and Greek equities though. Stocks relatively low still.

2469 2018-01-06 18:08:40 $NUU was a completely private IPO, anyone who wants in will have to buy on the bell. $200m mcap on list, 17,000,000g supply agreement by Q2 at around $6 profit per gram. $102m on that alone. P.e ratios of canna stocks very high. MCAP should be billions in a few months. #FFWD
2470 2018-01-06 18:08:25 I honestly haven't traded stocks since 2013 
2471 2018-01-06 18:08:15 Some of the stocks I like: GHCL, Thirumalai Chemicals, LEEL, Fedders Elec, IRB Infra, IL&FS Transport, Siemens, Aimco Pesticides, Sharda Crop, NACL Industries, InterGlobe Aviation, Spicejet, Hero Motorcorp, M&M, VST Tillers. Outliers: GMR, Jaypee, Swaraj
2472 2018-01-06 18:07:46 My parents lived off interest of CDs for years.Not option now, not enough funds to invest in stocks, can't afford risk either.People forced to live entirely off savings.Banks keeping funds, paying ridiculous salaries to top Mgmt,  or paying (many)huge fines for illegal activity

2474 2018-01-06 18:06:30 People love you Clay!! Like you control the price of all stocks. Hey give my personal favorite this week $ILUS a good review so I can make some money. Just messing with you. No real dilution so no real reason to drop much. We have a small cup just need a handle.
2475 2018-01-06 18:06:23 C’est un teasing hollandais... c’est comme leur politique loufoque qui consiste à piller les stocks des vins en les vendant à des prix tellement bas que c’était est hallucinant après avoir supprimé Delhaize wine world... #coherence et #batave sont deux mots qui ne vont pas samen
2476 2018-01-06 18:05:46 In 2017, US Dollar Index declined about 10% and represents about half of the gains in US stocks of 19.4% on S&P 500 Index basis. It’s still good growth and $USD is unlikely to reverse much soon, more upside to come... $USD $SPX

2487 2018-01-06 18:00:31 Rising stocks, job growth, cash for bonuses all part of Obama’s economic legacy.
8 years of growth.
Donald inherited a strong vibrant economy from Barack Obama.
2488 2018-01-06 18:00:26 Healthcare companies stocks have quadrupled under the ACA and Tom Steyers hedge fund had huge stocks in these companies. How much did he make and did he have prior knowledge of Obama’s plans which could be insider trading?
2489 2018-01-06 18:00:16 His podcasts are great but this has snake oil scam artist written all over it.  He did this with stocks back in the day.
2490 2018-01-06 18:00:01 Go trump! Stocks are soaring! 
2491 2018-01-06 17:59:48 Are you looking at the stocks? Are you even paying attention to the hiring rate?? How in the world do you come up with job growth diving?

In 1 perspective it can be used for light in darkness
In other it can burn the account 
In yet another, difficult to guess when the fire extinguishes

2501 2018-01-06 17:52:56 What a horrible thing to have happened, I hope you’re erecting stocks in the square in preparation of the guilty verdict x

2504 2018-01-06 17:51:52 But point1- " stocks moving either way. ". No intelligence in quoting directionless stocks .
2505 2018-01-06 17:50:35 They try to sell their crap to the public and the stocks get hammered. So they don’t go public because they are unsustainable with public scrutiny. So people but Apple Facebook etc. they are the best and most profitable companies in the world. And public.
2506 2018-01-06 17:48:59 You attacked Boeing and Amazon on Twitter and drove their stock prices down. Pharmaceutical stocks also fell after you tweeted.  You should be in jail.
2507 2018-01-06 17:48:44 Thank you for the actual quote.  As someone said about Japan in 1989, do you want good value or do you want stocks that will go up. That applied to Japan as early as 1986.  On one visit to Japan a highly regarded Nomura guru, told me their bull market would last until 2011 or 12
2508 2018-01-06 17:48:07 No, this is about American's having money and believing stock market is safe investment. Market is due for an adjustment, something experts agree on. Dow will fall soon, as will you. Oh, and you have NOTHING to do with Dow, other than when you manipulate stocks, #asshat!
2509 2018-01-06 17:46:46 And with most of the blue chip stocks well over $100 share most of middle class America will never be able to afford to enter the “markets” further proof the hat this tax plan is truly #BillionairesFirst
2510 2018-01-06 17:46:35 I use discount cash flow, peter lynch value, and gram number to make list of stocks to backtest. Estimate earnings growth for 5 year period. Also like to use return on capital and payout ratio (Under 45%) to narrow down the list as well.

2512 2018-01-06 17:45:50 So he should be fired because a newscast dropped the Dow...yet you manipulate stocks by making false allegations against specific companies, and...wait, according to your "thought" process, you should be...FIRED! #CommanderInThief
2513 2018-01-06 17:45:36 Surprising everybody says EV vehicles will disrupt and still AmaraRaja languishing for multi years now. Lead prices and margin pressure to blame though. All possible EV related stocks ran up in aniticpation of EV shift by 2030. But not the primary component.

2518 2018-01-06 17:42:36 I’ve made more money trading Crypto in the last 2 months yes. Overall stocks are still the focus but Crypto is very similar to trading stocks why not trade both?
2519 2018-01-06 17:42:36 You apparently do not understand the utter lack of control most have over their 401k investments. It is not like I could call a broker and move money.I advise ROTH IRAs to my Kids, and both slow and quick growth stocks. I had those as well thank God.
2520 2018-01-06 17:42:11  is looking good-stocks are up, taxes are down, economy is flourishing, real estate booming, illegal immigration down, opiod use is down. The rhetoric of #MSM creating this nonsense about our President when the facts show otherwise is psychologically unhinged #MAGA
2521 2018-01-06 17:40:31 Everyone’s upset about this tax cut saying big companies are gonna use it for their own personal gain.. I just got a massive pay increase bc we got to increase our min. wage. I also get a share of stocks. Plus full benefits (even tho I’m part time) and $2500 in tuition assistance
2522 2018-01-06 17:39:42 It’s a Rails shirt. I bought it from the best shop in the country run by my gorgeous friend Charlotte called @Kitchclothing she stocks lots of different shirts x
2523 2018-01-06 17:39:20 Sir in current market many ,big analysts are suggesting to  avoid buying of stocks directly...Instead suggesting to buy index or funds.will wait for your reply.
2524 2018-01-06 17:39:12 Dow crosses 25,000; yet 50% of Americans don’t own stocks, while the richest 10% own 84% of the market.  Just own it Kellyanne
2525 2018-01-06 17:38:46 I do. Too bad for ya. If u have a 401, u have stocks

2526 2018-01-06 17:38:30 #StockMarket is going up & up with #deregulation guy 45's actions. How about we discuss potential costs (please share) AND also what percentage of people hold stocks & what percentage of people in #RedStates hold stocks?
2527 2018-01-06 17:38:27 So True!  Not taking risks can cost you money...that is why I invest my money in stocks...and not bonds...or other low yield investments!
2528 2018-01-06 17:37:56 Half of Americans don't own any stocks.
2529 2018-01-06 17:37:03 True! But will a small investor be able to digest stomach churning falls sometimes in these illiquid stocks. Infact Illiquid stocks is for big players who can stomach the pain involved. Dont you think?
2530 2018-01-06 17:36:58 I bet that other 40 percent are extremely happy.  And out of the other percent, many pay no taxes and receive benefits for all others which is a higher rate in return than they could get with limited resources to invest in stocks.

Go back to college or a real one @SRuhle
2531 2018-01-06 17:36:45 Top 10% of Americans own 80% of all stocks. Wealth isn’t trickling down. We need an economy the works for all. #BlueWaveIsComing #VoteBlue2018
2532 2018-01-06 17:36:21 This cycle: FANG stocks with big secular growth (while "old economy", i.e. value  stagnates and EM economies struggle). Phase after next big bust will be policy-led tilt toward labor & fiscal, hence favors old economy. Same time, FANGs growth slowdown, regulation. "Value" leads.
2533 2018-01-06 17:35:43 Yes. Houses are to be lived in. Not hard. Flip penny stocks. #vanre
2534 2018-01-06 17:35:15 @MSNBC The top 10% own 80% of the stocks, why is the stock market so high?
2535 2018-01-06 17:34:07 The richest 10% own 84% of stocks....
2536 2018-01-06 17:33:47 I am sorry - The short answwer is: NO. When you look at the price for a COIN or a stock, you should never look at the price for one. Look at the "market cap". Market CAP is the price times the abount of stocks or coins.

There exist 16,785,962 bitcoin but 100,000,000,000 tronix
2537 2018-01-06 17:33:21 You do realize that next to none of your supporters/followers/cult members own stock right? It's only your rich friends that have money to invest in stocks so you are actually bragging about making the rich richer. There is not enough trickle down from them to help most of us.
2538 2018-01-06 17:32:39 Let’s face it a vast majority of his supporters don’t benefit from stocks & shares. They just see the extra $ signs & think it’s a good thing. Also financial bubbles can burst & have done so in the past.
2539 2018-01-06 17:31:18 Trump and Nunez come to mind and all of the GOP. A slid back to Bush Jr era of bankruptcy awaits. Jobs are down the market ready to blow up from inflated stocks just wait and see. This is crazy with the worst Congress and Senate ever. Soon Ryan will be out on his ass too.

2541 2018-01-06 17:30:08 Sorry dear.. i dont have..
2542 2018-01-06 17:29:52 Cool! Im pretty close to having trading as a legit part-time job so I'm almost always available if you have questions. Robinhood is Def the way to go if you're just looking to mostly buy and hold stocks for periods of time
2543 2018-01-06 17:29:50 Yeah, well the Dow is the value of 30 (yep, THIRTY) companies.
It's not an accurate reflection of the health of the economy.
Not to mention the fact that the top 1% owns 35% of stocks.
Their bragging is just false advertising.
2544 2018-01-06 17:29:27 Hey if it works, it works  Personally I use 50sma or weekly 10ema for stop loss. I only consider stocks that have stayed above those lines. I prefer to be in strong trending stocks period, eg. $pypl, $nvda, $ostk.
2545 2018-01-06 17:29:03 NFL playoffs start today earnings season for the NFL. Amazing the similarities in trading stocks and wagering on sports

2 You can’t bet it all on one game
3  Sum are tech bettors sum fundamental
4 Goin wit the herd is usually a bad play...
2546 2018-01-06 17:28:28 Do the 50% who DON’T own stocks include those who have pensions? Because obviously they own stocks indirectly.
2547 2018-01-06 17:28:23 Está por vir o GRANDE IPO !!!!
2548 2018-01-06 17:27:57 I have failed with soft copy versions of books,I will just wait this out til Aristoc stocks.
2549 2018-01-06 17:27:51 Most of your followers that got you elected don't own stocks.
2550 2018-01-06 17:27:38 Try to convince uneducated Trumpians of that. Every time he or his rich minions get out there and brag about the stock market these people think they've had a windfall. In reality the 1% who hold 80% of the stocks are getting richer and stashing the $$ or buying gold toilets.
2551 2018-01-06 17:27:30 Tax reform exacerbates this imbalance even more by making company ownership even more valuable. Stocks become more valuable by let’s say 20%. Typical profit margin is 10% taxed at say 3.5% for a net of 6.5%. Now it nets 8%. Which is 20% higher than 6.5%. Simple math...
2552 2018-01-06 17:26:33  laughing stocks

2560 2018-01-06 17:22:26 Stocks
2561 2018-01-06 17:22:12 With no good ipos. Tons of stock buybacks and new inflows going straight into ETFs have pushed average PE ratios higher just on more supply of cash versus low supply of stocks. Stock could go way higher....
2562 2018-01-06 17:22:05 You know 80% if stocks are owned by the top 1% right?  Most of those people with 2 or 3 jobs also have no benefits, possibly classified as “contractors” to help boost those stock prices.

2565 2018-01-06 17:21:27 If countries that sponsor and fund terrorism like #Iran and #SaudiArabia no longer do so, what does that mean for US defense industry? I’m not saying to sell your stocks like @kurteichenwald but you could set conditional orders if prices dip
#betterstocktips #maga #stablegenius
2566 2018-01-06 17:20:33 Also with indexing it becomes more of a currency of stocks than an investment in a company. So performance becomes more uniform. Money flows in. All stocks go up. Money flows out they all go down. ETFs have made the market less efficient.
2567 2018-01-06 17:19:45 If you mean 9:00 pm and a bunch of lites then yes! But I’m working today so I can earn enough money to buy up a majority of the stocks hahaha #gopackgo
2568 2018-01-06 17:19:19 This is a theory I’m thinking about. Many exciting new companies stay private. Limiting the supply of good investments for the public. Good public companies have more demand for their stock. It’s simply a different supply and demand dynamic. #stocks
2569 2018-01-06 17:19:05 A booming economy for who ? Do you know that a vast majority of the population do not own any stocks or funds.  Bonuses so an employee gets a 2k bonus or whatever the amount so what ! That does nothing in the grand scheme of wage disparity across the country.
2570 2018-01-06 17:18:55 I hope our POTUS as well as any other people he "Quotes" sues his ass off. 
No matter what anyone thinks of Trump. Not one person "not ONE" can say we would be better off if Hillary was in office. Amazing that those complaining will still enjoy the stocks and tax breaks

2575 2018-01-06 17:17:45 My strategy with Canadian pot stocks is to trade around a core $ACBFF position. $ACBFF looks to have a worlwide growth strategy. Sold $SPRWF this week for a 77% gain. Holding $OGRMF with a 15% gain.
Will consider positions in other companies.
2576 2018-01-06 17:17:03 if you dare invest in stocks, I'd suggest underappreciated commodities
2577 2018-01-06 17:16:55 You are right on this point. But we are seeing the bears give up now, as everyone comes around to the idea that this time it’s different and stocks will never go down. It’s *never* different this time, and the bubble will eventually burst. #GettingCloseNow

2581 2018-01-06 17:15:24 Major corporations will be taking those tax breaks and giving them to shareholders or buying up stocks and couldn't give a shit less about their employees, the ones who actually make their companies run and work. And again, their cuts are permanent while the middle class is temp.

2583 2018-01-06 17:14:15 You know how much research people do before investing in stocks, from the very fact that I shared one price to earnings ratio chart of the NIFTY, which is close to all time high levels, on Twitter, and the number of my followers increased by close to 75.
2584 2018-01-06 17:13:13 Both stocks crossed resistance level in a same day.
2585 2018-01-06 17:12:50 It's okay to miss a trade, don’t sweat what your missing and don’t chase #stocks.
2586 2018-01-06 17:12:09 The rich get richer. You think the world is full of mo mo's like @PressSec @SarahHuckabee stocks go up and down. Always. The middle class are getting a benefit. The poor? #NotMyPresident #Collusion #russianmoles
2587 2018-01-06 17:10:49 False. None of the states raised their wages to $15 an hour, or even close for that matter. Just looking for an excuse to defend the baseless claim that companies are evil and only buyback stocks from tax savings, which is now proven false.
2588 2018-01-06 17:10:29 ティッカーがXからはじまる通貨が個人的に好きなので、XSHにも興味があるんですけど、Stocksのアカウント作ってないんですよね。あした作ろうかな…
2589 2018-01-06 17:10:17 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2590 2018-01-06 17:10:09 Just bear in mind many people do not own stocks.
2591 2018-01-06 17:10:07 You can't have it both ways, what about your hateful comments to your nemesis Amazon that drove their stocks down. Should we fire you for that?
2592 2018-01-06 17:10:06 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $ACC, $IRET, $LXP, $LPT, all may climb w/in 11, 12, 17, 19 days up to 1.6%, 2%, 2.5%, 2.4% respectively
2593 2018-01-06 17:09:36 Isn't it something like the top 10% own 80% of all stocks? The remaining percentage should be the rest of us and the rest of the world. So, who benefits? Rich get richer.
2594 2018-01-06 17:09:24 (+) Week in Review: Altcoins, Stocks and Gold Shine as 2018 Underway...
2595 2018-01-06 17:09:04 STOCKS
2596 2018-01-06 17:09:00 He might be stupid I don't care my U.S. stocks have made me me a returns. I want Muslims vetted and low unemployment so who cares
2597 2018-01-06 17:08:40 Dont u guys find the inability to be able to offload such illiquid stocks a risk? Ran into this scenario in prev market. How do you mitigate this risk?
2598 2018-01-06 17:08:27 The war on drugs is about to begin? How much is beer and liquor stocks? Might be a good investment.
2599 2018-01-06 17:08:19 Your talking about trickle down economics...so I’m done if you think that actually works lmao, they don’t pay employees more they save it or invest in stocks, please go to school or listen to millionaires/billionaires talk about how it doesn’t work
2600 2018-01-06 17:08:11 This cabinet including Ryan and McConnell are laughing stocks, side shows now, and the more they stand next to Trump The Grump, the more feckless and irrelevant they become. GOP is ruined and is now a sham.
2601 2018-01-06 17:07:39 But the WSJ will still support his toxic agenda because less regulation for big businesses means stocks will climb higher. WSJ not looking out for the next generation to have clean air & little debt.. Mercers, Koch Bros, Fox News, WSJ all the enablers are guilty and they know it!
2602 2018-01-06 17:06:58 I’d go with something around it. Mine won’t stay on it so we have stocks.
2603 2018-01-06 17:06:36 Awesome bu rhe stocks are the same just duplicated and rotated
2604 2018-01-06 17:05:58 No, Kurt, YOU'RE the smart one. Selling your stocks was a stroke of genius. Your Tweets are insightful, highly entertaining, and extremely intelligent...... said no one ever.
2605 2018-01-06 17:05:40 Reading Financial posts on Twitter this AM. A lot of vague comments about stocks and assets in general. Very few actionable posts. The major media outlets are the worst. Just a bunch of words to create an article. Most R speculative, exhausting. Not criticism just #observation.
2606 2018-01-06 17:04:49 You don’t like hearing stocks are up unemployment is down isis has been beaten out of Iraq  and he’s trying to keep America safer work him instead of being a cuck and running away
2607 2018-01-06 17:04:45 I've been sitting in my car for the last half hour because it's snowing balls outside and i and just wearing socks n stocks
2608 2018-01-06 17:04:33 I have a 401k, a Roth based on stocks and mutual, but it's modest, but has grown 42%. When things start to correct, they'll all convert to metals....
2609 2018-01-06 17:04:26 LOL! Canadian Cannabis stocks have been good to you, and now you have a playground from Canada too - you must like Canada!
2610 2018-01-06 17:04:06 Stocks
2611 2018-01-06 17:03:51 Seriously such a pet peeve when I see posts on here about crypto/OTC. IDGAF about your bt.c fu.k or yo.u. I TRADE STOCKS! Go back to twitter
2612 2018-01-06 17:03:12 Jobs are mostly part time. Very low wages. Why do people have to work full time and are still homeless and rely on food stamps. Why is sears closing and other stores. Wait til the ballooon collapses. 50 percent of the people don’t have stocks. Stock market does nothing for them
2613 2018-01-06 17:02:35 Half of 2018 will be spent on buying those illiquid stocks. Being trying to buy them since last 2 months.
2614 2018-01-06 17:01:59 Trumps keeps touting TheStockMarket,but how many working poor/disabled or children r benefitting from booming stocks?
2615 2018-01-06 17:01:32 True. Decentralise. Especially getvaway from the rotten banking system and manipulated stocks on Wall Street
2616 2018-01-06 17:01:18 On a du mal en France à comptabliser les stocks en ferme..qui se développent et le  plus de rétention
2617 2018-01-06 17:00:06 Perhaps the best bull case for stocks

2620 2018-01-06 16:59:06 Stocks should be illegal.                        (This does not include the 2 shares of LaCroix of which i’m the proud owner, those are good & should be allowed)
2621 2018-01-06 16:58:41 With diligent research and analysis...stocks for the W!
2622 2018-01-06 16:57:09 Stocks
2623 2018-01-06 16:56:53 Want to own the means of production? Buy manufacturing stocks. #communismsucks
2624 2018-01-06 16:56:09 Not sure. Maybe short auto stocks? I just don’t see the levels of sales holding up once funding starts to be reigned in. Not to mention it seems are finally being built to last a lot longer as well.
2625 2018-01-06 16:55:53 gonna start buying shares in stocks after my 21st birthday 
2626 2018-01-06 16:55:47 Hey Emancipate, while you’re picking up your check & your stocks are going through the roof & your black friends are now employed & your illegal chaps are leaving & less of your friends are on food stamps, etc. stop showing your ignorance and show some respects to this lady. SAD!
2627 2018-01-06 16:55:41 You know you are growing up when discussing stocks excites you.
2628 2018-01-06 16:53:38 That's my bank's mobile app. Just a picture of some of my stocks in my brokerage account. You can open one with your bank in 2 mins online.
2629 2018-01-06 16:53:15 Maybe like when the tech bubble was going  nuts, you would see stocks going up 40% in one day for no reason other  than being a so called tech stock. Or maybe crypto may settle down for a  few that make it, by government regulations etc.
2630 2018-01-06 16:52:10 hi any good chinese stocks greg? ashr is too bland
2631 2018-01-06 16:51:46 I got a couple more stocks I would like to own for 2018
2632 2018-01-06 16:51:25 Don't forget gun control!!!  Bump stocks still legal...Shameful.   Make 2018 the year we stop this before the next vegas or church massacre.   Counting on you and @KamalaHarris

2634 2018-01-06 16:50:58 Stocks are like calculated gambling.. and I love it

2636 2018-01-06 16:50:27 I gotta get back on the road funds getting low and these stocks and fast enough
2637 2018-01-06 16:50:20 @realDonaldTrump 
Only 52% of Americans own any kind of stock and the richest 10% own 84% of all stocks. Quit touting the stock market and do something to help all Americans. #stocks #Dow25K
2638 2018-01-06 16:50:18 Most pot stocks are way to volatile yet. You’re better off investing in stuff like makers of hydroponic lighting or fertilizer companies at this point.
2639 2018-01-06 16:50:08 Look at BA and other components charts and multiples. Some of those "old economy" stocks are making fangs look dull last couple of year's.
2640 2018-01-06 16:49:53 I wish there was a website for people wanting to get into stocks that have no idea how to do it stocks for dummies
2641 2018-01-06 16:49:41 @Altcoinbuzzio To be fair in this, you should buy your stocks after you make a youtube video, so like this you don't have an advantage over everybody else, if you really want to help us and not take advantage of us, that's the fair thing to do.
2642 2018-01-06 16:49:36 I’m getting excited for the week ahead. A couple stocks to watch that could have news:
$FAT
$HS
$RTM
$FTI
Been long all of these stocks for quite a long time and added to them this week
2643 2018-01-06 16:49:15 Bummed to find @amazonprimenow is a disappointment. Major lack of selection (cant buy lots of things the local market it uses actually stocks), won't let me choose more than 10 items (funny when my family of 6 attempts to buy 40 apples) etc...
2644 2018-01-06 16:48:46 #Obama had Slowest econ recovery since Great Depression. Current economic boom (GDP low minority unemployment stocks jobs etc) isnt because of #Obama! Can’t have it both ways #Libs said if Trump won Stocks/econ would crash but now want to give Obama credit 4 great economy! #MAGA
2645 2018-01-06 16:48:28 Congratulations!  You're doing a great job so far.   But don't forget about gun control!  Bump stocks still legal after Vegas, TX church, and more.   Let's stop brushing it under the rug after a little time passes.  We need strong will to get this done.  2018 is the year.
2646 2018-01-06 16:48:20 i guess BS follows Paul Krugman, "economist"-- and sold stocks post-election 2016.  ha ha ha! and now she'll pay higher taxes in Calif (isn't she for the tax'em party??)  ha ha ha!  and she still hasn't caught on.  lol
2647 2018-01-06 16:48:02 The ignorant Hollywood people should know viewers are leaving in droves as Media stocks are the only stocks that are declining and Movies ticket sales are at the lowest since the 80's. They deserve it. Bad mouthing Americas choice 4 @POTUS
2648 2018-01-06 16:47:06 The Army is one issue, throwing dead fish back because they are the wrong fish is another, food banks everywhere a we throw dead fish back to err..conserve the fish stocks. Signing off the books not been audited for 10 years. And I could go on #brexit #Remain
2649 2018-01-06 16:46:00 Then TZero is way too  cheap..no?
2650 2018-01-06 16:45:57 Stocks
2651 2018-01-06 16:45:54 Lol my stocks are looking especially good! Ive made more money in 2017 then i did in a combined 8 years of obama! Oh btw i voted for that idiot obama too so i know talking points already
2652 2018-01-06 16:45:52 you dont even understand the difference between stocks and the economy
2653 2018-01-06 16:45:25 Tech IPOs. There are a few unicorns left that I am interested in investing in. Plus, I believe we are currently in a bubble that is about to burst, which will make a lot of stocks cheaper.
2654 2018-01-06 16:44:14 Super ! @MSR_Tlse faites des stocks !
2655 2018-01-06 16:43:24 Liberals were crying on election night , claiming stocks would tank, economy would tank, dooms day! Just the opposite!
2656 2018-01-06 16:43:21 I feel your pain, please find a way as independent wool shop owner 1/3 of my stocks now of questionable value thoughts with you to find a solution. Also @louisaharding would love to see your range continue. Bring on the adventure for 2018
2657 2018-01-06 16:42:47 The label looks like it's from a museum.!!  Who stocks it please? 
My wife is still coughing after 6 weeks
2658 2018-01-06 16:42:19 But if he does want to make that argument. Stocks were at record highs during Hoover, Reagan, and Bush 43's administrations before there was a crash
2659 2018-01-06 16:41:48 Good luck all. If you're into stocks, check out $MYSZ on Monday. I got in yesterday but should continue a good run next week. PT of $4.00
2660 2018-01-06 16:40:47 This is why the stock market is a poor gauge of broad economic health: Just 10% of Americans own 81% of US stocks. 10% of US? Very healthy!
2661 2018-01-06 16:40:36 Just had a long conversation with my mother-in-laws best friend about TENCENT, weed stocks, and Ripple 
2662 2018-01-06 16:40:09 Who’s got the hook up for purchasing stocks in Tylenol, Kleenex, Vicks, or Clorox? Definitely could invest, since it seems we are never gonna be healthy again! #sooversickness #flusucks #snotcooltobesick
2663 2018-01-06 16:40:03 There is only one side of the market and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. #forex #stocks
2664 2018-01-06 16:39:54 Nice, I like the use of those stocks but when will u reply to the DM ;(
2665 2018-01-06 16:39:43 @NSEIndia @BSEIndia @anilsinghviCNBC @SEBI_India those companies which are sending sms etc to dump junk stocks must to suspended from trading immediately this will avoid losses to innocent investor

2667 2018-01-06 16:38:52 Where do you think the risk lies for the CSE - US Cannabis stocks? Do you see a strong chance of delisting?
2668 2018-01-06 16:38:22 Most Americans don't own stocks. No basis on success.
2669 2018-01-06 16:38:17 When the WRU decided that they had to be even more idiotic and make themselves laughing stocks.
2670 2018-01-06 16:37:50 Sure - I’m open to any suggestions! I just started the goal of investing in 2018 so I hopped on there and then some stocks in Robinhood 
2671 2018-01-06 16:37:12 Instead of talking about the stupidest things that Presidents doing cheeseburger ice cream how many sprinkles on top want you guys we put out the real news like the stocks going through the roof,   everybody face has a smile on their face with their 401k .
2672 2018-01-06 16:36:42 It’s all about knowing what you own. We all wish we could catch stocks at the bottom but $Fat has plenty of upward potential!
2673 2018-01-06 16:36:24 Bye-Bye #JeffSessions sold and re-bought my MJ stocks two days ago.  Bought them back low yesterday and had a fab day.  Thanks Jeff!!  Oh and I think when it's your turn to be in pain no opioids and no medical marijuana for you, just pain.  From a #breastcancer warrior!
2674 2018-01-06 16:35:40 Quit quoting the DOW as a sign of economic health, as most Americans are not well off enough to gamble their hard earned cash, and have no stocks.
2675 2018-01-06 16:35:39 Wow that’s funny. Titans are one if the laughing stocks of the league. Can’t even sell out a 65k stadium in a must win game. I’m sure Bill would love to come here. Good stuff, be like Saban leaving to coach Kentucky football
2676 2018-01-06 16:35:11 @realDonaldTrump If the claim that today’s stocks and economy were due to Obama then why aren’t MSM broadcasting same? Too quiet from them about economy which says it is due to Trump
2677 2018-01-06 16:34:19 Doesn’t matter.  People are going to know on election day that economy was booming under Trump! I’m finally making some $ with stocks.  I haven’t made anything under Obama it was more like a savings account.  Companies are coming back
2678 2018-01-06 16:34:11 A rise in stocks means more money in your wealthy friend’s pockets but not necessarily jobs. Your own job growth rate was less than your predecessor’s. “his first year in office to this point surpasses 17 of his predecessors — trailing only Barack Obama, Harry Truman and FDR.”CNN
2679 2018-01-06 16:33:50 How many rifles did Holder give the cartels again??? How many bump stocks too??? @KamalaHarris

2688 2018-01-06 16:32:20 Im not a user, but isn't Sessions' going after the cannabis stepping on Trumps toes? he attacks from the federal viewpoint while the pot laws are being conducted per state. or is it b/c he has stocks in private prison industry?
2689 2018-01-06 16:32:15 Or the Yella Wood guy built him an upright stocks.
2690 2018-01-06 16:31:03 Most of the stocks are hitting 8 year and 10 year highs without fundamental backing ! Time to be cautious ? My bias is always bullish but when all and sundry stocks are flying , its better to be a contrarian .
2691 2018-01-06 16:30:36 with my friend for his rocket company, I’m also teaching myself about astronomy and quantum mechanics, entanglement and all other things like that and I’m also investing in stocks ( I’m teaching myself that too)

2693 2018-01-06 16:29:26 Investors no longer sell stocks. 
What are the alternatives?  
Yields are putrid and 
real estate is ridiculously overpriced. 

The fed has forced all investors to search for yield in the stock market.
2694 2018-01-06 16:29:07 I told my mom about these stocks I’m in she said “I’m like Cardi B na, them MONEY moves” LMAOOO

2696 2018-01-06 16:26:34 Okay, Jerry. That is the conspiracy. He has accomplished more in 11 months than ever believed possible. I hope he enjoys his well deserved golf game while my stocks continue to climb.

2699 2018-01-06 16:24:23 In 1999 during the internet bubble, internet tech stocks reached $7 Trillion. Cryptocurrencies collectively haven’t even reached $1 Trillion. If it is a bubble, it hasn’t even formed yet.
2700 2018-01-06 16:23:58 Very true, Alok
Can you please share some articles on GOGLEFINANCE function of sheets and how to speed it up for multiple stocks?
2701 2018-01-06 16:22:56 Oh please. You’re so vain. You probably think the tax plans all about you. Wonder how her stocks are doing...
2702 2018-01-06 16:22:55 You are lucky. I find that @Clicks_SA stocks their stores by demographics, which totally makes sense, and since I love in a predominantly white neighborhood I don't find the good stuff. @Dischem seems to stock the same stuff everywhere. Let me know what you find.
2703 2018-01-06 16:21:37 You obviously don’t know how economics work, not sure why I’m bothering. But things like consumer confidence, the stocks, etc are all very important to our economy, something that’s been lacking. Now that we have those things back, your seeing and will continue to see gdp growth.
2704 2018-01-06 16:20:28 Dems wouldn’t allow what.Deficits come from spending more than you take in like we have for the last 8yrs DOUBLING the national debt.(Mr Obama) The only possible way to dig ourselves out of this hole is by generating growth in the economy u can’t tax our way out of this mess
2705 2018-01-06 16:19:25 Loads of stocks.
2706 2018-01-06 16:19:02 Let's not focus on the fact that people have more money in their stocks and 401ks,  have more jobs, and will pay less taxes.  Let's continue to focus on the negative as the media is doing.
2707 2018-01-06 16:18:44 Please support the ban against bump stocks, bill A5200. These devices are unnecessary and extremely dangerous.@NancyFMunoz
2708 2018-01-06 16:18:14 This is fantastic news as I absolutely love Trade Ideas back-testing A.I. scans, charts & alerts for stocks. Adding all the crypto coins will enable me to fully day trade properly like I do with stocks.
2709 2018-01-06 16:17:52 It depends on the stock anywhere from 5-60 and I do some of the penny stocks

I would trade every dime my stocks have gained, for a POTUS that wasn't a narcissistic, bigoted, malevolent, toxic, unqualified global embarrassment. He is more dangerous to the U.S. than N. Korea *or* ISIS. #LockHimUp
2712 2018-01-06 16:16:49 Lehman moment from China will do it. Draghi not getting the backing from the new German Government. Set stops on your stocks.
2713 2018-01-06 16:16:38 It is a wise investment to invest in marijuana stocks.  Take a look at United Cannabis Corp ticker CNAB.
2714 2018-01-06 16:16:22 It's really not likely #WTI will rise to #Brent level. The customers are broke, not just in US but around the world. 

The rich buy stocks. The poor buy gas -- if they can afford it.
2715 2018-01-06 16:15:41 I've set a goal in 2018 to beat a record 2017 performance with making 50% less trades

In past 6 weeks, story stocks like $LOW $TIF $FCX $DIS show how fewer great setups can deliver big

I'm allocating ~60% of portfolio to 2018 'story' plays and 40% to highly liquid day+ trading
2716 2018-01-06 16:13:23 Not everything GOP does is pro-rich & meh-middle-& working class. But SO MUCH of your policy is directed toward the moneyed. Most ppl don’t have $ in stocks: most Americans live from check to check & are in debt...

2736 2018-01-06 16:01:48 How many of those companies have raised the hourly wages for the working class? None.  Claire represents working families, not corporate welfare recipients.  More people work for an hourly wage than own stocks.  She’s good.
2737 2018-01-06 16:01:43 Improve the muzzle and stocks
2738 2018-01-06 16:01:01 Yeah that's weird too. People will make their own decisions on where & how to invest. Whether crypto, stocks, mutuals, 401(k), real estate, a combo of the above, or nothing but a simple stash of cash under the mattress.

The shade-throwing, though...

2742 2018-01-06 15:58:03 I agree we can’t argue with the numbers. djt’s de-regs & tax cuts will have more effect going forward once in place, but stocks worldwide have been going up since before djt. He inherited a bull market from Obama, which he won’t admit.
2743 2018-01-06 15:57:17 Stock market gains only benefit the top 10%. Over 40% of all stocks in the usa are owned by the top 1%. This is no acheavement towards helping anyone but ur rich friends.
2744 2018-01-06 15:55:33 This is the truest bubble of all time. This and Toronto housing and Cannabis stocks.
2745 2018-01-06 15:55:27 I have been busy since the recovery, I don't have to find the work so much as it finds me. I contribute to stocks as a long term investment, I lost money in dot com, the investment bankers knew when to close, people didn't.  It's the cautionary tale, and there are warning signs.
2746 2018-01-06 15:54:47 My stocks went up yesterday it’s litt !
2747 2018-01-06 15:54:43 And yes, I'm very optimistic. Putting my money where my mouth is, finally investing in some cannabis stocks this past week thanks to Sessions helping to lower the prices for right now lol
2748 2018-01-06 15:53:26 would have stocks soon?
2749 2018-01-06 15:51:55 Yet the stocks are the highest they have ever been our economy is flourishing be glad in it
2750 2018-01-06 15:51:38 Jobs and the Dow do not go hand in hand. Most Americans do not own stocks , let alone a retirement 401k.
You only helped the 1 %

2752 2018-01-06 15:50:46 Another lie!!! Talk about the jobs lost!! How many ppl laid off since you took office? Stock market does NOT reflect this. Only reason growing is bc your buddies buying up their own stocks bc you gave them cuts! Ppl aren't stupid like you.
2753 2018-01-06 15:50:43 I don’t think they will get non-profit status due to their outstanding stocks & investment loans. They don’t have revenue to buy back all stock & pay back debt.

2764 2018-01-06 15:45:41 Theoretically yes. But fact is that most companies, especially mid caps, may not move in a steady & linear way. Nowadays stocks tend to move in bursts, both up & down. If one can consistently buy more at lower levels it can add up to a lot
2765 2018-01-06 15:45:39 Great episode. I loved the volatility/ATR points but I kept expecting to say "size your position so that you'll only lose 1R...". Perhaps that's easier to do in stocks vs your S&P futures example.
2766 2018-01-06 15:45:35 Stocks have been climbing for 103 months straight. If Trump matched Obama performance in the market, stocks would be 50%, not 20%. Obama increase was 150%, the third best since WWII.

2769 2018-01-06 15:42:31 @realdonaldtrump is such a #stablegenius that he strategically  ordered cease & desist orders which actually increased book sales for the book he does not want us to see. He is a different kind of "stable".Maybe he invested in Publisher stocks? #Compulsive #TraitorTrump #MAGA
2770 2018-01-06 15:42:22 - so, he didn't want to run, didn't want to win and is currently doing nothing. Yet we've decimated ISIS, tax cuts, record employment, soaring stocks...all from a guy that lies around eating burgers and drinking cokes in bed all day. That's what you actually believe?
2771 2018-01-06 15:41:46 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
2772 2018-01-06 15:40:55 Interesting to see who shorted pot stocks prior to Sessions contradictory announcement.
2773 2018-01-06 15:40:43 I think the tax cut will help food store and family restaurant stocks ... put another shrimp on the bbq this summer !

2775 2018-01-06 15:40:06 But let’s not forget that stocks are also soaring for the thousands of pension plans for the working man! And very needed right now to save these plans!

2783 2018-01-06 15:35:34 Watching a show talking about stocks, predicting 20-40% returns in a YEAR....  Bitch I can make more then that in a DAY with cryptocurrency!  These people crack me up!
2784 2018-01-06 15:35:27 I could be wrong but i see more potential in other stocks. Tnx for your opinion
2785 2018-01-06 15:34:43 Milspec doesn't mean perfect fit. I've had issues with stocks not fitting. Without knowing what part isn't lining up makes it hard to answer. I had an upper that wouldn't close right on a lower. Had to turn the buffer tube back one turn.
2786 2018-01-06 15:34:13 If you don't invest in stocks that is your own fault, the 50% that have, are very pleased!! This is exactly why we voted for @realDonaldTrump

2788 2018-01-06 15:33:30 Trump reversed the Obama regulations that had a choke hold on our economy. Now we are finally able to reach 3% GDP growth. Stocks exploding due to tax reform promise and delivery. #MAGA

2791 2018-01-06 15:29:19 As stocks and shares hit the highs all is set for Trump to crash the American economy, then blame Iran for its woes
2792 2018-01-06 15:26:33 Alert: If this is crazy America’s economy needs it and got it and has taken off ! Jobs up , bonuses up, gdp up, Blk jobs up , stocks up , retirement accounts up, Isis down , tax cuts working already , crazy like a fox !
2793 2018-01-06 15:26:26 Hence they prioritized the rich/corp tax cuts over the middle class working mans tax cuts.The dems refused to allow the deficit to be increased due 2 the rich receiving tax cuts. I always thought conservatives were against increasing the deficit I guess thats not the case anymore
2794 2018-01-06 15:25:31 Alert: If this is crazy America’s economy needs it and got it and has taken off ! Jobs up , bonuses up, gdp up, Blk jobs up , stocks up , retirement accounts up, Isis down , tax cuts working already , crazy like a fox !

2798 2018-01-06 15:23:40 Thank you!  I’ve never understood why they base the health of the economy on the stock market!  The average Joe doesn’t own stocks!
2799 2018-01-06 15:22:47 The reason they need 8 more Democrats to secure the middle class tax cuts is because the middle class + the rich/corporate tax cuts created more than 1.5 trillion in deficit if the GOP would have reduced the tax benefits the rich/corp got then the mc tax cuts would be permanent
2800 2018-01-06 15:22:25 Stocks
2801 2018-01-06 15:22:14 60' DENIED! Mods obliterate the stocks scrum and now have one of their own...
2802 2018-01-06 15:22:06 You mean those one time measly bonuses as companies buy back stocks reaping billions.  Your credibility is as low as the GOP who complicity undermine the investigation!
2803 2018-01-06 15:22:03 Do u understand how stocks and trading works?? Nothing just goes up up up
2804 2018-01-06 15:22:02 It's a scam called pump-and-dump that crooked brokers used to run with penny stocks and now they've found a new way to do it. That's literally it.
2805 2018-01-06 15:22:01 The same people who have unemployment at record lows, reduced govt spending & red tape, has Corps returning jobs, bonuses, plants and repatriating Trillions and stock markets worldwide soaring!  BTW, stocks benefit everyone's retirement plans.
2806 2018-01-06 15:21:50 Easy to say but the world does work on emotion, that’s the dirty secret no one wants to admit. That is Trump’s “secret”. He mainlines straight into the heart of what people fear and that’s instability. As long as he is the center of attn, stocks will be stable.
2807 2018-01-06 15:21:13 How many people sold stocks because Paul Krugman, and the rest of the Ivy League preached Doom And Gloom because Trump won?
2808 2018-01-06 15:20:45 Stock market growth only impacts those who can afford stocks, which isn't the majority of Americans.
2809 2018-01-06 15:20:35 You drove individual stocks down for example Boeing with your petty tweets. Look in the mirror you hypocritical projectionist.
2810 2018-01-06 15:20:15 Damn ass! You should know basic economy. There is no such thing as 100% cashing out on stocks on a healthy economy.

2827 2018-01-06 15:13:17 I’m not from E. Texas, I’m from E. Detroit, and we know this. Stock Market doubled under Obama because interest rates are abnormally low for way too long forcing retirees & savers into riskier investments like dividend paying stocks. Nothing Obama did was responsible sorry Chuck
2828 2018-01-06 15:12:14 Mr. Altucher is selling his cripto/stocks prognosis for 3000/5000 US dollars per year promising 1000% revenue. In the internet track logs of his prognosis are available (use google). People are not even getting 1% plus in 6 month - 1 year run.  Is he offering a scam?

2840 2018-01-06 15:06:42 Of course letting my equities ride... & constantly taking profits & rolling up / tightening risk. Individual #Stocks & $ES_F are where it’s at. Everything else (usually) helps but not the core bread & butter of my book! Although— I do think this is the year for #Commodites...
2841 2018-01-06 15:06:38 Oh how intelligent you must think you are with  closed mind to other thoughts and only your hatred for Trump.  I feel sorry for you, have a great life in la la land.  In the meantime my stocks ar soaring Thank you @POTUS
2842 2018-01-06 15:06:35 Looks like it. Having sufficient stocks of at least staple items is a pretty fundamental part of a supermarket's function.  But let's be honest if you were going down the tubes you wouldn't shout about it.
2843 2018-01-06 15:06:17 Also All Large Trump Donors / Affiliates should be checked for Sales of stock prior to said Corp. attacks & subsequent purchases made directly after the stocks tanked. If Proof is found accounts should be frozen pending investigation!
2844 2018-01-06 15:06:03 How about an SEC investigation into attacks that cost companies money: Macys, Nordstrom’s, Apple, Amazon, to name a few. Shouldn’t the SEC Lead an Investigation for Stock-Price Manipulation! They should ensure Trump didn’t profit from stocks lowered price after attacks!

2849 2018-01-06 15:04:51 Scott Adams' filter is highly applicable to investing in stocks, e.g. the permabear club is dominated by guys with 'more' facts. But some matter more: consumer/business confidence, the vector of regulation {now pointing down}, unbinding the invisible hand.

2868 2018-01-06 14:58:17 Part of that phenomenon is b/c those who have licenses to sell stocks/bonds use a "pre-qualifying" questionnaire that virtually eliminates the middle class from investing.

2872 2018-01-06 14:56:47 In your dreams. Some have 401k’s that’s expanded because companies don’t have pensions anymore, hence you see sexagenarians still working rather than having a good retirement. Stocks don’t affect the vast majority of workers in the real world.

2922 2018-01-06 14:32:53 That is not the case. If stocks will continue to rise it won't be because of inflation - it will be because of continuation of big govt spending and recovery which is THE actual driver. But who cares, right? 
2923 2018-01-06 14:32:44 Well you just gave corporations a huge tax windfall so no wonder their stocks went up.  But most Americans don't own much stock only rich like you do.

Stocks up, Taxes down, Employment up, Black employment lowest since 1972, Black home ownership highest in history, PRIVATE CORPS passing out $1000 bonuses like candy, manufacturing ↑

2973 2018-01-06 14:13:27 You attack specific companies and drive down their stocks ALL THE TIME.
And, yes, we ALL think YOU should be fired.
and by fired, I mean indicted, convicted, impeached, and jailed.

2974 2018-01-06 14:13:26 So stocks are soaring based on extrapolating today's solid growth + low inflation/interest rates into "forever" & putting a PE multiple on it. How can the @federalreserve not understand that by allowing markets to "price to unsustainable perfection" it creates a massive bubble?
2975 2018-01-06 14:13:06 Can all you middle and working class trump voters out there tell me how your stocks are doing and which ones will benefit you?
2976 2018-01-06 14:12:02 Yes, thank you.  On "silly prices" how would you weight "overall market" vs the actual individual value stocks you turn up -- in your overall exposure? Do you weight one factor over the other?
2977 2018-01-06 14:10:58 Ya exactly lol and I am very confident with my stocks I currently own for the next 6 to 12 months ! Good weekend to you 
2978 2018-01-06 14:09:49 ONLY 10% of Americans have stocks so this doesn’t really make America great it makes rich people greater and that is not the fucking point.

2988 2018-01-06 14:04:53 Sir, technically all stocks fit that description, no! 
If your followers want to make money, then IFCI might do the trick; but if they want to create serious wealth, then there are much better ones out there eg Apl Apollo pipes
2989 2018-01-06 14:04:20 Huh? Pound was 1.22 or so Jan 1, 2017, is now 1.35. 10% rise of Pound/Fall of USD. Can$ .75 1/1/17, .85 now. USD has hit multi-year lows recently vs. many currencies: approx 12%. This can push up stocks and, of course, trade gap wider as result. This is probably a policy choice.

2996 2018-01-06 14:02:15 I'm sure you already considered dividends on some stocks that pay you for the shares you hold. By re-investing those dividend payments, you can compound your stake in the company. Something that I haven't seen any coins or tokens do. I'm certainly no expert though.

3003 2018-01-06 13:56:42 thanks sir. does calculation of intrinsic value via FCF method is rational way to value stocks whether its undervalued or not, because its tough to forecast future cash flow by seeing past trend and then there are assumptions like dis rate, terminal rate. pls guide

3007 2018-01-06 13:54:49 Watch the film "the Big Short" about what led up to the 2008 crash. A very few low level people went to jail, taxpayers bailed out big banks, CEOs got big bonuses and NOTHING that caused it was fixed. When stocks go way up, watch out. An IRA/401k is not safe from these thieves

EVIL GENIUS!!
3015 2018-01-06 13:48:39 C'est quand même dommage de détruire les stocks...
3016 2018-01-06 13:48:16 Thank you @RWPUSA to say what we’re thinking. When 45-worshippers mention stock market high, he reminds us stocks are irrelevant when you have a 2-yr-old in control who thinks the nuclear button is a toy to be wielded at other 2-yr-olds. Joke’s on the American people.
3017 2018-01-06 13:46:18 Scott, does this statement include mutual funds or just stocks. You are right I have no stocks directly but my 401 is thru the roof at 25%.
3018 2018-01-06 13:43:30 @Tennesseine  The stock market is going up because, the wealthiest corporations are doing stock "Buy Backs". Many CEO's bonuses are in the form of stocks. They buy back a bunch to falsely raise stock prices. Then pocket the money.
3019 2018-01-06 13:43:18 Good, let them all laugh at raunchy jokes while their IRA's are sky high, stocks, their mansions all increase in value, all in all, everything good going up, while their ratings are only thing dropping!

3025 2018-01-06 13:39:21 His actions most certainly aren’t those of a madman. He didn’t get where he is in life w/o possessing competence, especially items concerning economics. Stocks are soaring & his base followers still love him. Go by what u see, not what u hear.
3026 2018-01-06 13:38:54 Vous pensez en malthusien et materialiste c'est une erreur de raisonnement. Le capital et les ressources ne sont pas des stocks mais des flux.
3027 2018-01-06 13:37:58 Decision to get out of the games depending luck or not. Most time bad for me keep the stocks to get more money better than in and out the games. I Play common shares in&out easy.
3028 2018-01-06 13:37:20 Jeff Sessions has $ in private prisons & I have stock in MJ, it’s a conflict of interest. Thur. after his   interview my stocks plummeted. I proceeded to purchase more at the lower rate. Good for me it came back up yesterday to where I broke even on 1st buy & made $10k on 2nd. 
3029 2018-01-06 13:37:02 Good morning on this first Sunday of 2018! @cnn #josephborelli I applaud your defense of @potus but I disagree with you along with many others. Stocks have increased but #mentalstability &  #worldpeacenonukes is the focus

3032 2018-01-06 13:35:50 do you understand how the stock market works?  the value is only real when stock is bought or sold (just in that moment)!  if right now everyone started selling all their stocks, the market would collapse and be worthless.  This implied value is based mostly on chatter (activity)
3033 2018-01-06 13:35:26 Plz make sure got enough stocks thank you 
3034 2018-01-06 13:34:28 Weed stocks gonna be a hig investment

3038 2018-01-06 13:32:55 Just remember "Value created" equals imaginary money until the major stockholders cash in those stocks or exercise their rights before they drop which will happen soon; then what happens to the rest of us? Our IRA's 401ks, etc...?
3039 2018-01-06 13:32:48 Lol limited stocks again zzz
3040 2018-01-06 13:32:35 Although I don't always agree 100% with POTUS of the time he knows exactly what he is doing and if you HONESTLY dont see a problem with DOJ you have a problem. BTW do you have stocks in the market? You enjoying them extra dollars they are making? Thought so.
3041 2018-01-06 13:32:21 Same can be said for stocks.
3042 2018-01-06 13:31:07 50% of Americans own no stocks. Of those that do, more than 50% of that wealth is owned by only 10% of the richest Americans. Most Americans don't profit from a single dime of that wealth.
3043 2018-01-06 13:30:37 Dejando de lado la mala educacion, las garantias salen plata, los stocks de repuestos salen plata, las actualizaciones y soportes de software salen plata y asi, para poder decir salio mas caro tenes que ver todo eso

3046 2018-01-06 13:27:25 Inside traders should loose all the money on the stocks sold
i.e 39 million plus what ever profit he might of made. 
Then they know if they get caught they loose everything.
3047 2018-01-06 13:25:36 Most of us don't own stocks, moron. Your stock market is doing great anecdote sure is good for you and the other 1%. Still waiting to see how you're gonna #MAGA MY America as 35yo sgl mom with Multiple Sclerosis on SSDI.
3048 2018-01-06 13:25:10 Hahaha thanks Obama for everything . What a joke. Obama did nothing with ISIS whilst Trump has destroyed them in first year. Stocks have actualy gone up by over 6000 since election win.
3049 2018-01-06 13:24:45 Trump is gross but amazing for the stock market. All he does is tweet about the market. He’s the best pumper ever - time to go long. #stocks
3050 2018-01-06 13:24:35 Furthermore, if you believe my quote of cat stocks is wrong investigate for your self.
3051 2018-01-06 13:24:19 I’m still seeing lots of articles about “value” and “growth” stocks, as if a clear distinction can be made. 

Let’s talk about this tragedy of fund marketing, the pitfalls of using ROE and the time horizon on episode 16 of “Off the Cuff.”
3052 2018-01-06 13:24:00 Garantia 1 o 3 años, repuestos para 1 o 3 años, actualizaciones a cuantos años? Stocks para todos o para los comprados, riel catenaria?
3053 2018-01-06 13:24:00 After #LasVegas @DisneyResorts changed their "do not disturb" signs to "room occupied." Admirable empty gesture, Disney. Question: did you use your influence in Congress to order them to pass gun control? Or does Disney still support assault weapons and bump stocks?
3054 2018-01-06 13:22:34 absolutely correct 'there is no easy money'
3055 2018-01-06 13:22:03 401K are Ponzi schemes are tied to the stock market, the overwhelming majority of stocks are still held by the top 1% to 10% so it's a horrible indicator of the real state of the economy. Spending is a much better indicator & it's still weak as fuck with wages so low.
3056 2018-01-06 13:21:24 Even the quickest glance at the chart makes it pretty darn clear that, unless you have a short investment horizon, you should be heavily invested in stocks, directly or otherwise.
3057 2018-01-06 13:20:57 How my mother was ever a fan I'll never understand. Amazing how you chime in when your "hard earned" millions are going to be tapped into. Why don't you be fair and sing hooray for how well your stocks are doing. Oh how a star dims into obscurity...
3058 2018-01-06 13:20:34 Hi,
I will be tweeting to suggest and give info on emerging and multibagger stocks.
3059 2018-01-06 13:19:49 hear hear someone finally said it! The stock market only interests the rich who own stocks
3060 2018-01-06 13:19:42 Its funny how celebs n media paint him with the hes nuts brush whilst hes given best tax cuts ever, lowest unemployment rate in years, fall of ISIS, highest stocks ever recorded. Facts are facts and here say is here say
3061 2018-01-06 13:19:14 Wages rose 2.5%.  The middle class owns stocks in their retirement accounts.  More importantly, the stock market is a barometer for future earnings which leads to more jobs, etc.
3062 2018-01-06 13:18:56 Stock market broke records under Obama. But, stocks are not an indication of the economy.
3063 2018-01-06 13:18:36 sir is PBV is correct measure to value stocks and if yes for which sectors?
3064 2018-01-06 13:18:29 A mutual fund is a form of collective #investment that pools #money from investors and invests in #stocks, debt & other securities. Who is the regulator for #mutualfunds in India?

3072 2018-01-06 13:11:16 Lol hmmm are you enjoying your 401k and stocks ?
3073 2018-01-06 13:09:08 And the stock market has been going up since 2009 after President Obama inherited the depression from Bush. The stocks rose very fast with Obamas administration. There is no reason to believe that you are the impetus of the continuing of the economic rise. The crash is coming.
3074 2018-01-06 13:07:28 Sooo you all despise him will boycott if he attends but now you say he is choosing not to come. Do you not see how stupid this sounds?  I’m loving my stocks and 401k but I’m sure you don’t care about stuff like that as you are insanely wealthy!
3075 2018-01-06 13:07:04 It is the destruction of prudence in investment decisions.  Pushing 80 year old retirees into stocks.
3076 2018-01-06 13:05:21 When you mentioned Boeing, you manipulated the stocks and you know it

3097 2018-01-06 12:52:13 Before 2016, part time jobs were counted as full time jobs, so I a peson had 3 part time jobs then they would be counted as 3 full time jobs

In fact, the median income under trump is almost double that of Obama, and this reflects in DOW & other stocks rising

U are fake news
3098 2018-01-06 12:49:49 Ed the stocks have his records and numbers NEVER seen in history ever. So unfortunately you just seem like an u educated kid in a tantrum.??
3099 2018-01-06 12:49:44 Forgot when you drove Amazon stocks down few weeks ago, saying they were stealing from USPS.
3100 2018-01-06 12:49:18 If he's shacking up and sharing expenses with a cute bunny, wisely investing 10-15% of his $73K yearly salery in stocks and mutual funds and his credit score is above 680 then he could lead a modest lifestyle in a $169,500 home ;)
3101 2018-01-06 12:48:59 Well, this recovery has been in place for years now. We all know that. The stock market and corporate profits have been through the roof the last several years. Wages have remained flat. We know that. We’ll see if corporations share their new tax cuts rather than buy back stocks.
3102 2018-01-06 12:47:49 Thinking people who are watching the economy and jobs growing, taxes down and stocks up are pretty proud of Trump!  Maybe you’re the idiots. #TDS

3103 2018-01-06 12:47:47 It's mind boggling. , earnings season likely to drive Dow to  30,000 in very short order , could be the strongest january for stocks on record ? $QQQ $SPY $IWM $EEM $DIA Soon they'll be talking 35,000 ?

3108 2018-01-06 12:44:59 One can't figure out if the today's high is higher than justified. Why should the next crash come? Add to confusion- there are stocks not yet risen . #FOLO = neighbour's envy
3109 2018-01-06 12:43:52 Tax reform is a win for the top 1%. ISIS isn't crushed. Media has reported on stocks & jobs. North & South Korea talking has absolutely nothing to do w/your dad. Fact based information. Are we allowed to say that? #FlipItBlue2018 
3110 2018-01-06 12:43:48 As a journalist you are a joke. People out here aren’t as stupid as you believe. You and your Leftist comrades are loathed and would be laughing stocks if your lack of professionalism wasn’t a threat to the Republic.

3123 2018-01-06 12:34:05 You mean trillions of dollars for the top 1% since they own approximately 80 to 90% of all stocks.
3124 2018-01-06 12:33:10 Yeah we can see economic growth != better jobs. All that money in the rising stocks is going somewhere, though...

Not to mention 80% of stocks are owned by the richest 10% and the tax bill gives 83% of cuts to wealthy.

3188 2018-01-06 11:54:34 Let me translate: The economy doesn't change overnight - policies, new Prez etc takes time before they translate into jobs or stocks. With Trump in office less than a year & the growth you tout following 8-year trends, it likely owes more to Obama than Trump.
3189 2018-01-06 11:51:38 Whose fault is it that they don’t own stocks?

Will they keep going up? 

Will they be regulated?

3223 2018-01-06 11:12:36 we all agree that technicals are king (for execution), but the next time some idiot tells you "fundamentals dont matter". ask him why is $AAPL $175 and $TOPS $0.25? why is $AMZN worth $600B and $ATOS worth $3M? why do stocks react to earnings? why do news affect stock movements?
3224 2018-01-06 11:11:43 Go and steal people’s cow and expect them to smile at you. In as much as I condemn their retaliation but no Southern guy would smile at someone stealing their stocks. #BenueKillings . Let’s call a spade a spade.
3225 2018-01-06 11:10:49 No idiot. Corporations buying back their own stocks is driving the increase and unemployment has been at 4.1%.  Thank @BarackObama for that.  #TrumpIsALiar

3228 2018-01-06 11:08:53 As much as I love to see Trumps cuts working, confidence grow and stock markets soar, can’t help getting a bad feeling we are in a massive bubble. Too much debt and stocks too high, stocks look like going much higher yet, just can’t see this ending well.
3229 2018-01-06 11:08:24 @moneybloke how do you keep track of so many stocks? So you keep a watchlist ?
3230 2018-01-06 11:07:50 No idiot.  Corporations buying back their own stocks is driving the increase.  Nothing to do with you.  #TrumpIsALiar

3235 2018-01-06 10:54:19 Not arguing with right to bear arms. But no reason for ordinary citizens to own AR-15s , bump stocks, silencers, high capacity rounds. Those are designed for one purpose: murder.
3236 2018-01-06 10:53:38 Hello @emotiontech, beaucoup de vos PLA 1.75MM sont en cours de réapprovisionnement, avez-vous une idée de quand les stocks seront réapprovisionnés ?
3237 2018-01-06 10:52:54 There's a shift away from cash - stocks, gold, property, p2p, crypto-currencies.
3238 2018-01-06 10:52:37 The Jensen and Dylon Joint co. We do stocks. We also make joints.
3239 2018-01-06 10:51:36 Big cheese with "inside knowledge " of news detrimental to the company stocks, and offloads his holdings before the news is out? Insider trading. SEC should investigate.
3240 2018-01-06 10:46:52 So you are saying that ppl with a 401k (which is invested in stocks) do not have an interest in the stock market? Interesting perspective. Can you explain it?
3241 2018-01-06 10:45:55 E a volatilidade do mercado de cryptos é justamente o que torna ele tão atrativo, preços absolutos são irrelevantes, o que interessa pra quem tá investindo são justamente esses swings de 10, 20 ou até 30%, enquanto em stocks 5%/d é incrível
3242 2018-01-06 10:44:06 SOLD OUT NA SAMSUNG. waitng for new stocks nlang.  Thankyouuuuuu sa trust.
3243 2018-01-06 10:42:55 Could u list the other 18 junk stocks just incase I’m holding any of them 
3244 2018-01-06 10:42:34 IMO crypto requer muito mais estudo e atenção. Principalmente boas TA skills e saber sobre portfolio management.
Crypto é a democratização do investimento, trad banking é simplesmente inacessível pra muitos, ainda mais quando falamos de stocks ou commodities

3246 2018-01-06 10:41:16 Thank you for 6 trillion in stock value.  I’m sure stocks will trickle down eventually too right?  Oh, maybe if we all bought stocks with our massive tax cuts instead of paying bills, we’d all be millionaires right?
3247 2018-01-06 10:37:43 I also own both your ‘junk stocks’ Uncle A 
3248 2018-01-06 10:37:41 @LoganPaul wow your literally making poor your stocks are going down by the second
3249 2018-01-06 10:36:02 I voted SA but I'm happy with our (NZ) current bowling stocks.
3250 2018-01-06 10:35:34 "Unnecessary regulations" like the Paris agreement that if followed is the only way that the human race and the planet have any possibility of survival? You can't eat or drink stocks, bozo.
3251 2018-01-06 10:33:53 Good to see @shaunmarsh9 and @mitchmarsh235 stocks rise today. Still a bit to go to catch ‘bitcoin’ @stevesmith49. #silencethehaters

3257 2018-01-06 10:29:02 Also, the only this that makes a currency “legal tender” is the fact that    Statue says that it is not subject to capital gains taxes. Without enforced capital gains taxation everything widely desired is a currency. (Stocks/bond securities and material things.)

3259 2018-01-06 10:18:45 Oh you mean the basic economics that the top 10% of wealthy Americans own 80% of the stocks in the market? The stock market that mostly benefits the rich? Or the basic economics where job growth is at a 7 year low and jobs numbers were lower this month then anticipated? Your pick

3266 2018-01-06 10:07:32 People keep on chasing cheap stocks that lie in the range of 20-40.
For them, Eicher Motors and Page Ind. were overvalued in 2008 when they were in the range of 2.5k
Those cheap stocks are nowhere to be seen now while EM & PI have breached 25K level.
Always thrive on quality.
3267 2018-01-06 10:07:15 Point 2 
If Point 1 wasn't bad enough. The vast majority of the Cheesy Hat & T-shirt Cult do not own stocks.
3268 2018-01-06 10:06:34 How does this refute what I said? This explains how stocks are taxed - not how they impact the economy. If 10% of the population is taxed as above - how is that a marker for "the economy is doing great!" that's like saying "Hey 1 out of 10 of us are doing great!!!!"

3273 2018-01-06 10:02:39 My prsnl opinion.these stocks gav multibagger retrns n the past.if u need multibagger returns in future. these stocks mst go many folds frm their current mrkt price eg:goa carbon 1000 to 2000 fr 2x. hw abt picking a quality stock at 60s or 70s n taking away 2x at 120s or 140s ??

3296 2018-01-06 09:46:28 Another claim in the book that is false. Aide clearly didn't get through explaining the 1st Amendment before DJT drew his lip down and rolled his eyes. No explanation of the 2nd needed. DJT is all on board killing people with bump stocks. Don't think aide got to the 4th.
3297 2018-01-06 09:45:35 The Sentencing Council need to have a bit of a rethink. Strike ‘Financial Hardship’ as an excuse for keeping the licence. Should have thought about that before the event.

3312 2018-01-06 09:24:41 If this would know somebody, she or he would be a clairvoyant. Ups and downs are a fundamental behaviour on all assets/stocks worldwide. My opinion is, I am holding it for one or two years or longer.

3314 2018-01-06 09:20:35 Technically, anyone can trade stocks. Download the Robin Hood app, it makes it very easy! Then take a small loan of a few hundred dollars and start trading!  That or just buy Bitcoins, whatever you think is better!!
3315 2018-01-06 09:19:46 Bingo. I'm old enough to remember at least 2 or 3 other times when everyone was loving the stock market. You'd hear Mrs. Smith talking about it in the grocery store line up. Next thing you know all the tech stocks tanked. (I lost thousands that I never saw again)

3319 2018-01-06 09:16:43 The stock market hit a new high for who? Only those who have money invested in the stock market!! Half of Americans don’t even own stocks and cannot even afford to buy stocks! So who does the market benefit!?  The Rich!

3331 2018-01-06 09:04:27 Looks a little too plain, everything is all in the middle with nothing else on the screen. Colors don’t match very well. Try a different font and don’t put the text on the logo, make the text bigger. Try different types of background designers. Use stocks that match it for more

3333 2018-01-06 09:00:40 That’s not stereotypical at all.. and I thought “only the rich own all the stocks”! So by your comment just democrats have profited from this rally

3335 2018-01-06 09:00:19 Thanks Shashikanth.....

but again selling decision  is subjective n dynamic whether to follow formula (where we  need to decide probability of success/  failure)or booked out after doubling ....

3338 2018-01-06 08:59:11 No one said there's no fish in the North Sea. Stocks are booming BUT it's a sad indictment of the method of pulse fishing that in the areas it's heavily used there's a problem.... coincidence?
3339 2018-01-06 08:58:21 No that was Obama’s when we were on the brink of financial collapse. He put in measures to safeguard us from that again. The Trump show is deregulating, stocks are going up. A price will be paid in the long run. Who will step up and fix the @GOP mess  when the poop hits the fan?

3346 2018-01-06 08:50:23 All markets are 'manipulated': stocks by corporate share buybacks; commodities by the big producers (and OPEC for oil); FX by CBs...There is nothing 'efficient' about the mkts in that regard. Using EMH to make investment decisions is a losing proposition.
3347 2018-01-06 08:49:43 Bila nk start main UT / stocks nih?

3349 2018-01-06 08:47:07 They are also supporting the interests of the many Americans earning less the $40k and who don't benefit from share price as they don't have enough spare cash to invest in stocks. These people are the voting majority.
3350 2018-01-06 08:45:44 And instead of funding the pensions corps buy back stocks bcs they think DC will support them
3351 2018-01-06 08:45:21 Bvoz there are many stocks which does grow in weeks & months..

3353 2018-01-06 08:44:08 It was a de facto bet on the election, but somehow tied to stocks that would jump in the event of an HRC victory. I dunno the ins and outs but whatever stock they bought into tanked and they lost a lot of dough
3354 2018-01-06 08:42:09 Flash sale in the abbey shop today - Jan 6 -  35 per cent off all Christmas  goods while stocks last.
3355 2018-01-06 08:41:40 Wait. What? Was their bet on stocks, because then they would have won, given that shares are up? Or did they bet on the actual outcome of the election?
3356 2018-01-06 08:40:48 >Crypto is the same as stocks, or gold certificates.
I disagree. Crypto is a triple-entry ledger built into the currency, which is an enormous innovation in human history. The things that this enables for our future are literally astronomical.
3357 2018-01-06 08:38:59 My coworker really made over 200k from stocks

3366 2018-01-06 08:29:45 You are a free human being and always allowed to make your own decision.
No one is telling you what to do.
Crypto is the same as stocks, or gold certificats.
3367 2018-01-06 08:26:20 Why did AT&T just lay off thousands of people? Are you saying its CEO doesn't own stocks? Why do *CEOs themselves* say they will use money from tax cuts 2 buy back their own stocks & enrich shareholders, NOT create new jobs or increase wages? Trickle-down economics is a fantasy.
3368 2018-01-06 08:23:15 Damn really good grand finals between Charlie and Elegant at FPF tonight. 

That MU looks so annoying playing as fox  lol I’d be on  after losing stocks the way Charlie did. Fun sets, good shit to elegant.
3369 2018-01-06 08:23:13 And a lot of high level people in companies get bonds as part of their contract, which can be turned into stocks and then sold, obviously the higher the stock the higher the price
3370 2018-01-06 08:20:30 The world already sees us as laughing stocks.

3375 2018-01-06 08:15:34 Bitcoin is backed by a decentralised technology, a block chain. Their is also a limited (finite) supply of bitcoin that can be mined which also adds value. It is the technology itself that makes it valuable. Gold stocks are manipulated by central banks.

3382 2018-01-06 08:07:24 People keep on chasing cheap stocks that lie in the range of 20-40.
For them, Eicher Motors and Page Ind. were overvalued in 2008 when they were in the range of 2.5k
Those cheap stocks are nowhere to be seen now while EM & PI have breached 25K level.
Always thrive on quality.

3401 2018-01-06 07:51:26 I'm very happy you and your friends were able to buy back stocks and find a place to stash your money before the economy collapses under the strain of your terrible fiscal policy. Congratulations on that, sir.
3402 2018-01-06 07:50:52 Steve has had bitcoins since 2014. Steve has stocks. Steve is a kennedy
3403 2018-01-06 07:45:55 1.  Yea.  You don’t own stock.  It’s not about putting eggs in one basket.  See rich people own individual stocks.  There money is not tied up in a retirement account that can’t be touched until they are 60 like you.
3404 2018-01-06 07:44:52 Yeah sure Amie, I'm a pumper and my tweets can really move stocks. Lol ... You're just lazy.  Get off your but and do some research why don't you.

3410 2018-01-06 07:43:09 You stated unemployment is low (as it was in November of 2016), and stocks are high, (as they were in November of 2016).

You cited two things that haven't changed and declared "improvement," then complained about others ability to argue rationally...

3417 2018-01-06 07:36:21 That’s your argument? Wall Street optimism? Most people don’t own stocks and there are many jobs that don’t offer 401k’s so where’s the benefit of Wall Street gains for those people? Corporations aren’t going to hire more people due to tax cuts. Stop with the misdirection.
3418 2018-01-06 07:33:55 Yeah, and that kind of logic is definitely more common in other industries (vested stocks). I think issue w/ Kobe was always he'd never take a backseat, but that would definitely have helped some of other burn.

3423 2018-01-06 07:24:11 It’s pretty evident that’s the case. Wolf’s stories are already springing holes, and it just hit the shelves. Dems are backed into the corner now that economy is gaining big momentum, unemployment down, and stocks are up solid. So they’re going to use tactics like this, and more.

3428 2018-01-06 07:18:17 This week has seen many stocks breaking out. Investors would be better off adding to the winners already in their portfolio. Rather than chase new ideas all week long.

3436 2018-01-06 07:13:05 We have social media and computers. Stock traders had to manually sell all the stocks in the late 90’s. Now we have digital exchanges open to public. 

This is next level. I’m not saying most of these stocks aren’t bubbles, I’m saying these bubbles are just beginning to blow.
3437 2018-01-06 07:11:42 Goddamn. Tell me where you work so that I can throw some money into the stocks there and I can make more from your hard work than you do.
3438 2018-01-06 07:11:26 It's tricky, as many in the crypto kingdom will argue that tax is BS & can't apply to crypto, but over here we get taxed on BTC gains & AUD value as if trading any normal stocks. Some people might laugh, but if you're pulling Fiat out and not paying - could hurt more later on.
3439 2018-01-06 07:10:30 A cow for her milk

And stocks, besides,

For their dividends.

3447 2018-01-06 07:02:27 In addition a lot of the stocks are going up because the companies are re-purchasing their own Stocks rather than paying their employees more. Bringing money once again to the wealthy corporations.
3448 2018-01-06 07:01:43 Geez your on all the runners early (-;
3449 2018-01-06 07:01:36 you do realize that 80 percent of the stock market is owned by the wealthy. So the Stocks going up really doesn’t involve most middle-class that can’t  invest in it. It does have a up-and-down effect on 401‘s. But basically this is again a big corporation money win .

The people who voted for you don't own stocks. Stock cars, yes. I can see how there might be confusion around that, but it's wrong for you to exploit that.
3460 2018-01-06 06:50:16 Whole blockchain stocks and crypto are classic late cycle shooters as well as other crap. But what is puzzling is complete lack of vol in major averages. In 1998-1999 markets corrected often and substantially.
3461 2018-01-06 06:49:32 The top 2% own 80% of the stocks, anyway.

3463 2018-01-06 06:48:51 What part is working, the added debt or pay down of debt, Stocks market rising stock value isn't doing anything to Increase the wages 'throw the dog a bone tax cut' for the middle and lower income spending will not offset the tax cuts to begin pay down of our national debt.

3467 2018-01-06 06:45:38 Ah, no. Point is asset classes go through cycles. 70s good for gold, bad for stocks.  Reverse in 80s & 90s. Just like next 10 yrs probably better for intern. stocks and gold over US stocks.  Nothing lasts forever.

3472 2018-01-06 06:41:39 Gold is useful for building conductors with high reliability, resistant to damage and corrosion. It's safe to say a world without gold would be way slower, less reliable and... uglier. Stocks give you dividends and voting power. Ripple? It offers absolutely nothing.
3473 2018-01-06 06:39:51 All these wise actions are totally contrary to human nature! The first step in learning how to pick big stock market winners is to examine leaders of the past, like those you’re about to see, to learn all the characteristics of the most successful stocks. 1/1
3474 2018-01-06 06:39:45 This advice came from my accountant...if you had shares and stocks...sell them when you are not earning any income #TaxReturns
3475 2018-01-06 06:36:31 This doesn’t mean Jobs Jobs Jobs. This means that people like you and your rich friends, that can afford to invest heavily in stocks are making more money. Doesn’t mean a damn thing for me or the majority of Americans. We see through you. #Loser
3476 2018-01-06 06:36:09 As if you know anything about stocks. Your sham company has never gone public.
3477 2018-01-06 06:35:45 I have verge as well still holding 28000xvg what are you top penny stocks for 2018
3478 2018-01-06 06:35:16 My dad is so smart when it comes to picking great stocks- he doesn’t know when to sell tho if your shit goes up 150% in a month span SELL IT MY NIGGA. It’s gonna go down as quickly as it went up9 times outta 10 
3479 2018-01-06 06:34:47 How much was new jobs? Remember a company's stock value and what it pays employees are unrelated. Companies don't get money from stocks except at initial offerings. Stock market money doesn't get back to companies.
3480 2018-01-06 06:34:39 @ColorsTV @_BiggBoss11_ @BeingSalmanKhan - why is this not shown in the Tv ?? You are showing only@good things of her ... I am@done with Shilpa - no involvement
3481 2018-01-06 06:34:25 Trying to learn about stocks. Money management is a hell of a thing.
3482 2018-01-06 06:32:57 How can we Stop Trading on 401k when the Stocks correct and start going Down?   It looks great now
Thank You, but what goes Up must come Down.    Day Traders can cash out,  But what about 401ks?
3483 2018-01-06 06:32:23 Nah we out here into real stocks
3484 2018-01-06 06:32:15 Looked at my stocks today & let’s just say I’m VERY impressed already
3485 2018-01-06 06:31:40 2018, and we're back in early 1900s rn.. when shoe shine boys and cab drivers were buying stocks, giving tips, and getting rich.. only it's nerds and artists buying crypto, giving tips, and getting rich #cryptocurrency #crypto #Millennials #money
3486 2018-01-06 06:30:55 Yeah true like I vaguely understand how stocks work and that you have to take a risk to make money but like if I was gonna invest in bitcoin it would be get in make my money and get out fast. All that bitcoin has to offer anybody is the hype, which can go at any time.
3487 2018-01-06 06:27:51 Remind us again how; derivatives, futures, options, stocks A B , bonds, commodities, credit, funds, insurance, annuities, forex, interest rates, IPO’s, Uber, Google, Facebook, central banks, 401K etc. etc.  [Differ]* 
3488 2018-01-06 06:26:03 Goddamn it, NO. Everyday Americans do NOT have stocks. Where the phuck are you getting your statistics?
3489 2018-01-06 06:25:10 Officially 20 now and the first thing I did was open a stocks trading account can’t wait to learn and see what I can get myself into
3490 2018-01-06 06:24:47 Don't expect you to like my name,  I'm sure you don't like the booming economy,  lower taxes,  stocks hitting 25,000 for the first time ever, consumer confidence at an all time high either right? Wait.... let me guess your uber original response will be Obama did it.  Save it.
3491 2018-01-06 06:23:24 Pls suggest some long term investment stocks.
3492 2018-01-06 06:23:23 I too feel market will run very fast. Will catch everyone unexpected .

Many stocks will breakout & have superb run in next 1-2 months.
3493 2018-01-06 06:22:20 Your investment and stocks then! Very interesting to read what you’re doing with them! I wish I understood better. Very cool
3494 2018-01-06 06:22:10 You must be receiving a free SUNY education.. get your facts straight idiot.. My 401k, stocks, IRA look amazing!!! Oh yeah.. so does the jobs and unemployment reports
3495 2018-01-06 06:21:24 not sure if your bank can do this but ik you can walk into your chase bank and be like yo i wanna buy some stocks and they can help you out
3496 2018-01-06 06:20:53 Everything is LOWER. Everything but STOCKS. Most Americans don't own STOCKS.

3498 2018-01-06 06:18:02 Those are crypto currencies :b May seem like just investments but the technology thats being delivered is crazy. Actual stocks is just straight $$$$$$$$$
3499 2018-01-06 06:17:27 Daiso is either out of or discontinuing the CoQ10 sheet masks, according to the person who stocks one of my nearby stores, since they apparently haven't been able to order them in a while.

Hopefully they're just out.
3500 2018-01-06 06:16:12 you can do it too, medical marijuana stocks 
3501 2018-01-06 06:15:31 hey i wonder what it would take to get @realdonaldtrump to realize that the average American has virtually nothing invested in any kinds of stocks -- they can't afford to.
3502 2018-01-06 06:14:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
3503 2018-01-06 06:13:33 Just feel so  embarrassed that your station is insane. Just watched so many lies n pathetic  displays  of ugliness towards our ELECTED potus. How many executives there have made on stocks this year? He’s not going away 
3504 2018-01-06 06:13:11 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your ADHD
3505 2018-01-06 06:13:07 Uy. Ba’t andami niyo pang pera? Nagrarun out na kami ng stocks :(
3506 2018-01-06 06:11:36 my wild friday night: researching and ordering sample paper stocks
3507 2018-01-06 06:11:17 Go get you some stocks!!!
3508 2018-01-06 06:10:28 Great article, happy to find iRobot on your list which I've owned as well for a period of time due to my love for Roombas. Personally I believe in investing in single stocks with a limited allocation of your portfolio as it keeps sharpening your senses.
3509 2018-01-06 06:10:17 The amount of money in the bank, stocks, or 401k is meaningless if the dollar means nothing. The money is good only as long as the health of the country is good around the world.

3511 2018-01-06 06:07:02 I love how everytime I go into Trader Joe’s, I talk to this one old man that always tells me his life story about how he’s been there for years on end getting that .50 wage increase being damn proud of it. He makes 6 figures a year off penny stocks and bagging groceries lmfaooo
3512 2018-01-06 06:06:37 With stocks I use the daily, but since crypto moves so fast, 1 hr = 1 day

3514 2018-01-06 06:05:35 Bitcoin crashed from what i heard, could be wrong though. There’s an app call Black Wall Street you can look up some stocks there and they are all black owned businesses.
3515 2018-01-06 06:03:22 How about penny stocks that the ave person can buy, would be nice,we can’t afford stocks in the  hundreds per share.
3516 2018-01-06 06:01:30 WF compares $arna Etrasimod to Fingolimod. Wonder if they compared it to the Fingolimod ANDA's from $Teva, #Aurobindopharma, Zydus, Torrent, Biocon, Strides, Prinston, MSN Labs PVT LTD, Alembic, all FDA approved in 2017.

3520 2018-01-06 05:56:24 Ah yeah saw a tweet just now that Yong standee sold out. Idk how they do it but JH MH JS aren't yet maybe they produced same amount so Boices can still choose between the 3 but yeah its frustrating not to have enough stocks :(
3521 2018-01-06 05:54:49 something R missing, guess they envision big gains in their communication stocks from all the new high priced plans which await us
3522 2018-01-06 05:53:15 Buying stocks has never been easier
3523 2018-01-06 05:52:54 Oh hey I finally made a tiny bit of money on my stocks
I need to look into dividend stock at some point
3524 2018-01-06 05:52:13 A friend asked me what is value investor? I asked her why is she asking me this? ( she has nothing to do with stocks ). She says she sees these terms on Facebook and Tinder now days!! Unbelievable where value investing is heading..
3525 2018-01-06 05:51:19 Yeaaaaaa about that...you might have the mark of the beast, 666 aka www if you trade stocks
3526 2018-01-06 05:51:02 Stocks Wrap Up Best First Week in Years.   Stocks have closed out the first week of 2018 with a bang, with the Dow adding 2.33% in the first four trading sessions -- the best start to a year since 2003.
3527 2018-01-06 05:49:44 ROFL... So clever. I almost ignored your follow. "Stocks" 
3528 2018-01-06 05:49:39 Value for who....?  The 50% of the U.S. that can’t afford to invest in stocks??

3530 2018-01-06 05:48:45 Bought some stocks today, I don't know how y'all do that 9-5 shit
3531 2018-01-06 05:47:24 Trump supporters misled into thinking this has something to do with improving their jobs and income needs. My stocks are soaring but no where near those of the rich and most Americans have no investments.
3532 2018-01-06 05:46:11 Cry baby , did you forget only the people who have money own stocks.   Thanks for the tax hike #worst president
3533 2018-01-06 05:44:42 Who benefits if the Walmart Stocks do well? Investors, not the clerks.

3534 2018-01-06 05:44:07 US commercial crude stocks have fallen 20% from March peak to 424.46mn bbls. Almost reached 5-yr average of 420mn bbls. That's giving support to WTI, despite rising production which will hit 10mnbpd soon
3535 2018-01-06 05:41:07 “if trump wins stock mrkt will crash” said the liberals. Trump wins stocks at record highs. Liberals say “it’s cause of obama” lol
3536 2018-01-06 05:41:04 Shout out nga pala sa mga tindahang kung magbenta ng softdrinks wagas ang presyuhan pero yung stocks nila nung 2017 pa. Punyeta!
3537 2018-01-06 05:40:36 Good stocks
3538 2018-01-06 05:38:24 Decided to try investing in stocks this week with @RobinhoodApp. First stock I bought was @Twitter. I mean, everyone uses Twitter right? What can go wrong lol
3539 2018-01-06 05:37:46 Good, because he knows you're stupid enough to, he bought stocks in the book, so every idiot could make him richer that buys it...believe they are defying him...muhahahhahahah
3540 2018-01-06 05:37:00 you do realize that majority, the vast majority of Americans do not own stocks, so this booming stock market is just making RICH Americans Richer ! for the rest of us, who cares !
3541 2018-01-06 05:36:56 OMCs' not looking bearish infact some Energy stocks have bullish set up. Keeping in mind Hpcl-Ongc deal, chances of decline look bleak to me.

3543 2018-01-06 05:35:26 The markets are reacting to the orange psychopath in the WH. Watch commodities prices spike as people flee the dollar and buy tangible assets. Defence stocks too if you're looking to invest.

3553 2018-01-06 05:25:44 While most of the stocks are at all time high/52 wk high/verge of BO/bullish charts etc.. how can a crash is justified in technical analysis..?

Does the crash mean only to highly volatile stocks ?
Is it not safe to take long positions in growth stocks now ?
3554 2018-01-06 05:25:14 What's not up is wages - they're stagnant, and job growth is down.  Companies are leaving the U.S in record numbers.  Imports are way up - steel from China is up 18%.  Stocks are for the rich, not middle America.
3555 2018-01-06 05:25:13 $rgt as well bought in and a few seconds later got halted lol i didnt even know what i was buying at the time i was chasing the run >_<
3556 2018-01-06 05:22:01 What about them bump stocks eh? They’re all good again right?
3557 2018-01-06 05:21:36 Losers like you Steyer are  despicable.  Enjoy your rising stocks and tax break.
3558 2018-01-06 05:20:44 I think this is true more broadly though.  As a matter of fact, about 50% of adult Americans own no financial assets (stocks, bonds, currencies (crypto or fiat)) of any kind.  Really worrying...
3559 2018-01-06 05:19:58 You don't actually know what stocks are do you? That means there is economic activity. Economic activity creates jobs. Jobs are what people need. So yes, it does help. Maybe go watch the #gorillachannel and leave the economics to better people.
3560 2018-01-06 05:19:27 Money, big pharm $, private prison $, asset forfeiture and seizures. Any of these politicians  have stocks in these companies? It's all greed now.
3561 2018-01-06 05:14:50 @andrewrsorkin Poor LibTwit DNC Andi eating crow lost big time as he went short on stocks:) as DOW SOARS & tables truning on Crooked HRC & ChiraqBarack & his Gestapo spies So predictably PATHETIC Merry XMAS LOL
3562 2018-01-06 05:14:21 A lot of independent labels have to . Contracts are small and the major label has the upper hand . Also if by major label in the future , than come back when big hit goes public (yes public with share stocks ect..)
3563 2018-01-06 05:13:29 Nice list! I think you could add "How to make money in stocks" . "Trading in the zone" and "The little book of common sense investing"
3564 2018-01-06 05:13:15 Be on the lookout for $NVDA in 2018! Best performing chip stock last year and rallied more than 100%. Expected to have another big year  #stockstowatch #stocks #BullMarket #stockmarket #investors #TradingRevolution
3565 2018-01-06 05:12:30 My friend lives in Canada. When she is here she stocks up on single kool aid packs. They don't sell them there because it's the MOST stolen item in the country hahahaha.
3566 2018-01-06 05:12:20 #cryptocurrency #Amazon will announce feb 2 which coin they will use. #XRP showed up on one of the website they bought. #trading #stocks heads up people.
3567 2018-01-06 05:11:37 So because I trade stocks, futures, and commodities, I guess that puts me in the top 10%. So this is what being rich feels like...
3568 2018-01-06 05:10:28 Retail traders like me look for cheap,  low pe stocks like pfc,  rec,  Tata motors,  Glenmark etc to go long and vice versa to go short

3572 2018-01-06 05:06:51 I did.... you said,  " his base don't own any stocks".

3574 2018-01-06 05:04:32 And what about those who live paycheck to paycheck and haven’t been able to invest in stocks. What say you about them? Asking for a friend.
3575 2018-01-06 05:04:01 Regulating a woman’s body is more important to this pile of manure than regulating bump stocks and silencers.

3578 2018-01-06 05:01:11 stocksではその価格で推移してるんですね
3579 2018-01-06 05:00:18 Yeah that’s what I’ve learned. I was heavy in Twitter and GoPro and I sold and went to a more long term plan. Trying to also find some stocks with good dividends as well
3580 2018-01-06 05:00:15 The largest successes that are not realized by at least half the country (doesn’t own stocks).  The rest are worried about their future for dozens of reasons, and are trying to make sense of the insanity. Last rat off the ship gets no credit.
3581 2018-01-06 04:59:34 TWN Stocks: CSBC Corp (2208 台船) - despite running up 10% on 12/5, this company is really, really low on cash and desperately needs new financing.  So count on it doing a CB or a massive secondary.   You're not gonna like it.   RUN!
3582 2018-01-06 04:59:14 stocksでは1195satoshiの攻防が続いてますが…
3583 2018-01-06 04:58:36 250,000 new jobs!?  Try 170,000!! Stock market record bubble? 80% of Americans can't afford to buy stocks! How does stock market help them!? You and Daddy still manufacturing your ugly stuff in China?
3584 2018-01-06 04:57:50 Thanks for the free listen.  Stocks continue to rise now due to a 40% tax cut more so than general consumer confidence or confidence in @realDonaldTrump.
3585 2018-01-06 04:57:09 Mine has doubled. I suggest you pick your stocks better
3586 2018-01-06 04:56:18 Business channels should give more data than opinions. Why is there no real analysis done of the many midcap stocks. Data that would be difficult to get for retail investors but not for cnbc. Even covering one/day would take 2 years.
3587 2018-01-06 04:56:17 54% own stocks which is down from 62% before the 08 crash. 22% of those earning $30,000 or less own stock. More should invest. Your negativity sucks.
3588 2018-01-06 04:56:07 You are full of $HIT!! What do you think our 401K's are made up of?? Even union pensions are invested in stocks. GTHOT
3589 2018-01-06 04:56:02 Its just more surreal irony because I remember Trump supporters getting mad that stocks did good under Obama "despite unemployment" and Hillary "loves Goldman Sachs". Somehow Trump can do the opposite of both things and people give him credit anyway.
3590 2018-01-06 04:55:33 It's because we the people dont care ,we dont have stock,many that had it ,lost it all after 9/11 ,myself included!People like you with money like your family did, dont see the loss as a middle class person does!What has the stocks done for me as of late?!!!
3591 2018-01-06 04:55:07 I think the size of the 6000t relative to even high estimates of London stocks would have to lead to the conclusion that some of the EFPs are for metal in other locations, eg kilobars in Asia, lack of transparency here doesn't help.
3592 2018-01-06 04:54:51 Be careful with tech stocks. Tech gets disrupted at the speed of light (SnapChat, GoPro, Twitter, etc.)
3593 2018-01-06 04:54:49 If Martha Stewart can do time for selling her own stocks.  Hillary can do life for her crimes
3594 2018-01-06 04:54:41 As a pitcher, I love this
3595 2018-01-06 04:54:40 モアじゃん
3596 2018-01-06 04:54:34 I know what’s sensible and what’s not ...even Piramal Group has invested 150 crores in the venture ..I hope u do not have any investments in the group stocks .
3597 2018-01-06 04:51:20 Stocks and crypto currencies are so stressful
3598 2018-01-06 04:51:11 Yeah I'm just waiting for the bubble to burst just like the tech stocks in the 90's.  There is no way for this to sustain.
3599 2018-01-06 04:49:51 Fais tes stocks de chocolat !! 
3600 2018-01-06 04:49:21 Almost everyone who has a job has stocks and a 401k even Walmart employees but they usually don't have any control of how their stocks are handled so the stock market doesn't mean much to them.
3601 2018-01-06 04:47:46 Want to know if you're an idiot or not? Look at your investments and if they consist of Bitcoin, Ripple coin and no stocks.....And you bought Ripple with leftovers after a -50% lost on $SNAP
3602 2018-01-06 04:47:44 Trump, left for Camp David this afternoon, chose to tout "tax cuts, job growth, stocks" at the media instead of THIS?
3603 2018-01-06 04:47:35 Hey guys, not everyone has a 401k or stocks, but maybe working two jobs and eating hamburger and Raman noodles like we did instead of using plastic might help you in future.  It's called "sacrifice" and "delayed gratification."   It works; read The Millionaire Next  Door.
3604 2018-01-06 04:47:34 dude I put 10,000 into penny stocks and made 1.6 million, also I shot an arrow into a forest at random and got a deer, ask me how I did it....? 

Yu'd think this guy would have had his fill at 1.6 Mil

3608 2018-01-06 04:44:15 What is the percentage of ownership of the health care and insurance agencies by composite government stocks?  Might come in handy to understand this issue.
3609 2018-01-06 04:43:10 I told u gamble is more fun than playing Stocks
3610 2018-01-06 04:43:02 You do realize the stock market rise has nothing to do with you and more importantly most of your base doesn’t own stocks. Duh
3611 2018-01-06 04:42:51 I’m a blue collar worker, I work in industrial manufacturing. My company stocks have doubled in the past 15 months. It was $46 in 2009, it’s currently at $147. 
I’m not sure who you’re referring to?
3612 2018-01-06 04:41:40 AFAIK is one of he most versatile gun and one of the easiest to turn into a very fast firing gun thanks to bump stocks.

Those things should not be sold anywhere.

3617 2018-01-06 04:35:05 Love how stocks began to rise the day he was elected. But go on... tell me how there's no way any of it had anything to do with him because he watches guerrilla tv
3618 2018-01-06 04:31:55 And what does that mean to the average american who cant afford to gamble with stocks?
3619 2018-01-06 04:30:41 Also i don't think the pres is stupid for his political views (if he has them/knows them). It's his lack of coherence/use of languagethe repeated statements that evince someone not grasping basic concepts.  EG, saying the natl debt goes down when stocks up. Nonsensical.
3620 2018-01-06 04:30:16 Hmm...your Hillary vote was the better choice? Please open your eyes.  Have you lost your job yet?  How are your stocks doing?
3621 2018-01-06 04:28:40 There's no euphoria. Stocks are supposed to go up 1% a day. Don't get me wrong, our portfolios are rocking, I just know it's not because I'm that smart.
3622 2018-01-06 04:28:32 Money people are applauding "the economy": stocks up, tax cuts. Yet wages are "inexplicably stagnant". What could possibly be the reason...
3623 2018-01-06 04:28:11 Hahahahaha! Si Kiel kasi ehh. The main issue kasi is they have separate inventories for renewing and new. Renewals has 0 stocks while New has surplus. And they can’t share yung surplus sa gusto mag renew. Which is stupid.
3624 2018-01-06 04:26:11 Omnibus of joy right Free orphan stocks are queens, Kabuto have GERD Why won’t do your training we learnt summoning down
3625 2018-01-06 04:26:01 Sorry just getting this. Nice rebound today. Siting on 75% cash. Short term; smaller weed stocks can offer greater gains then having cash in $WEED ... $WEED has to hit $75 for me to double again, whereas $HIP went from .60 - 1.60 in 2 days and i caught that ... how about you?
3626 2018-01-06 04:25:55 Do your strategies and techniques work on all stocks or just penny stocks?
3627 2018-01-06 04:24:57 I can tell you are new to crypto, there are no stocks in this space. And the ATM doesn't dispense money it only takes money in so there won't be anything to run out of and if the ATM was to full of money none of the cryptocurrencies would be available.
3628 2018-01-06 04:23:49 Will the 2 yr outperform stocks dividend + underlying appreciation comparing all to inflation (real). Of course risk is the factor with the crazy herd, the wild card.
3629 2018-01-06 04:22:35 Thanks pops.  MAGA plus scotus , plus jobs, stocks, Dems losing.

3632 2018-01-06 04:21:09 Very salient point Banker.

If you're making money from rubbish make sure you have some of your capital in better stocks .
3633 2018-01-06 04:19:56 @ShannonBream I heard the jobs created for 2017 is the lowest since 2009 and @BarackObama created more jobs his last term than @realDonaldTrump first year in office. Stocks all-time high but no bueno if the jobs created are fewer than expected
3634 2018-01-06 04:19:26 48% of Americans have zero money in the stock market. Top 20% of households own something like 90% of stocks. Top 1% owns like 38%. AP and news orgs owe the public proper context.
3635 2018-01-06 04:18:59 Ayaw sa online te uy hahahaha naa koy kaila te nag pa apil ko txtan ra daw syag naa na ilang stocks 
3636 2018-01-06 04:18:46 @realDonaldTrump looks like you’re doing really well for the top 10% who actually own stocks but how is your working class base that put you in office doing?
3637 2018-01-06 04:18:28 @realDonaldTrump  You are doing such an awesome job Mr. President! I am getting so sick of Fake News!! Funny you type Fake News and MsNBC and CNN come up! No other President has had to fight as hard as you, stocks are up, employment is up, wages are up but yet they still hate it!
3638 2018-01-06 04:17:52 I've realized, since October di nako nakakabili ng stocks..
3639 2018-01-06 04:17:48 So,  what does that mean in terms off the average American? I'll give you one hint: NOTHING.  The value of stocks are overinflated and it's gonna crash and burn,  dumbass.

3656 2018-01-06 04:07:38 This reminds me of the penny stocks when pot go legalized. There will be a lot of bag holders when bubbles pop and coins dump
3657 2018-01-06 04:06:27 IMO the mass herd of blind sheep  (the buyers of pot stocks regardless of overextended price action or technicals) will realize the pot run is temporarily over and will move their money into #Lithium & #Cobalt. I’m eyeing the juniors like $AAZ, $NRM, $LIC, & $CUZ

3665 2018-01-06 04:00:30 Yep more $ for the rich... most Americans are too poor to own stocks. Fact is less than half of Americans own stocks so the OVERINFLATED OVERVALUED stock market has no impact on most Americans. It is just the rich getting richer... until the stock bubble bursts in mid 2018
3666 2018-01-06 04:00:17 Economic growth stocks up jobs are up while you cry underneath mommas sowing table in the basement about oppression and make believe nazis go draw some more pictures with crayons or maybe be productive and pack those bags and move to Canada.

3673 2018-01-06 03:58:57 Market cap wise around 63 per cent. The PEs of other stocks are even more higher. See the next tweet.

3676 2018-01-06 03:57:46 We, investors love it! Trump made it possible for big corporations to buy out the little ones and eliminate the competition. That is why stocks are up! Obviously you, either do not own stock or do not know investment strategy. All the tax break money going to foreign investment!
3677 2018-01-06 03:57:24 There are currently two options: to buy real estate or to buy stocks.
Decide: which will be the better investment? Why?
3678 2018-01-06 03:57:01 Imo take out Hoot and place it with IGAB, its grandeur, the anticipation, the increase of SM's stocks just because it was announced, the YT award, that era's wholeness is a legendary

3684 2018-01-06 03:52:57 Awesome for people who own stocks! Yippee.
3685 2018-01-06 03:52:51 There's difference between some stocks & purchasing huge shares. Economists r very clear about the misappropriation of wealth & how/why it's happening.
3686 2018-01-06 03:52:50 Remember when you called 18,000 a bubble caused by artificially low interest rates and told everyone to sell their stocks?
3687 2018-01-06 03:52:31 the # of stocks up YTD is 2551.  #2551 is FIZZ, up .02%
3688 2018-01-06 03:52:20 The GOP Dinosaur’s are giving the rich Dinosaurs a huge tax break without closing up the loop holes for unearned income from stocks and such...
3689 2018-01-06 03:51:35 Yeah all the rich are buying up the stocks!!

3692 2018-01-06 03:47:21 When ya boy calls to talk stocks
3693 2018-01-06 03:46:31 Shutout to the homies who put me on these stocks n shit lol
3694 2018-01-06 03:45:37 Big business & shareholders expect massive corporate tax cuts, increasing profits after subtracting taxes and workers’ salaries. Stocks are rallying because of this. Despite promises the wealth will be shared with workers “this time,” the market rally & history suggest otherwise.
3695 2018-01-06 03:45:27 Nope no news yet. I ordered mine last month but I think the seller will be refunding my money cuz she couldnt get hold of stocks anymore. So we can only hope merchandise will be sold on concert day.
3696 2018-01-06 03:45:04 Ugh, lost 3 of my 4 stocks to single hit rage UpB from Bayo
3697 2018-01-06 03:44:37 @realDonaldTrump please after your fake media Awards tell them that was fun but from now on your office better be respected and if they have something to say it must be the truth or you will pull the plug on that entire network and ask people do sell their stocks
3698 2018-01-06 03:44:32 Yo, I told myself in Feb LAST YR I was gonna get on bitcoin... I started learning the stocks and other markets first.. Smh My foot so far up my ass I literally CRIED lol
3699 2018-01-06 03:44:24 Bull  ! Most of the stocks are owned by the big wigs that are in line to benefit from the new tax laws! Just more money in their already overflowing bank accounts.

3701 2018-01-06 03:43:33 It could be legalized federally in 10 years and that's still a good thing for American weed stocks.
3702 2018-01-06 03:42:59 80 percent of stocks are owned by 10 percent of Americans.  So, yeah 10% of America is doing Great!

Will it trickle down?

Sure, to the lowest bidding contractor most of the time.

And in case you don't know : lowest bidder typically pays his works the least.

So a real TRICKLE.

3705 2018-01-06 03:42:00 You apparently don't realize even if you are not in stocks it shows the economy is growing. People and companies invest in stocks because business is good and when business is good means more jobs which YOU should care about.

3707 2018-01-06 03:41:33 Stocks only refer to the rich, the rich are getting richer and the poor will get poorer
3708 2018-01-06 03:40:08 @LuxCrypto I wanna learn more about cryptocurrencies and trading (stocks and shares etc) and was wondering how you learnt. I know absolutely 0 but am genuinely interested in it. Wondering if you could help point me in the right direction @Callux
3709 2018-01-06 03:40:06 There are several penny stocks Chinese related that when north today
3710 2018-01-06 03:40:00 This may be the last straw - - er, weed - - before the populace storm the castle. Cutting flax to benefit eorls, house carls and thegns is one thing. Putting folc in the stocks, or worse, for burning of weed is beyond all reason. #MMGA (MJ, not Mercia)
3711 2018-01-06 03:37:21 Put a husky on it. I would bet it all on Canadian #Cannabis stocks. Also, it's spelt humour with a "you" - Americans 
3712 2018-01-06 03:36:42 And yet half the citizens in the richest country in the history of the world STILL make less than 30k per year, and have less than 500 in savings. Stocks alone dont represent the well being of a nation.
3713 2018-01-06 03:36:30 50% of people dont pay taxes how the hell are they going to invest in stocks without a job. #MAGA
3714 2018-01-06 03:36:21 Buying BTC LTC ETH is like buying blue chip stocks and altcoins are like buying pink sheet penny stocks. I call that dumb $ #coinbase #gdax
3715 2018-01-06 03:35:43 Why? You don’t have stocks? Ira? So you pick on someone that’s helping America grow??
3716 2018-01-06 03:35:26 Less than 15% of Americans own stocks.
3717 2018-01-06 03:35:16 Not a fair test. A FAIR test would be how many of us could make a million starting with the millions Trump inherited/started with. A clam could do better than he did just by investing in blue chip stocks. Well, until his latest scam- grifting POTUS.
3718 2018-01-06 03:33:36 But he bought them legally. Guns, ammo, bump stocks, etc. All legally obtained. If only there were a way to prevent it.
3719 2018-01-06 03:32:42 It feels good to start making money again with my stocks keep up the good work Mr. President thank you.
3720 2018-01-06 03:32:27 I agree, my 401k's and Stocks are frigging Magical right now and I thank #DonaldTrump for that. #Liberals destroyed #America and now we are bringing it back to watch the #FakeMedia soil themselves. #MAGA

3724 2018-01-06 03:30:51 However 401k and IRA results do depend on how the stock market does. Owning individual stocks however is a game only the rich can afford to play unless they're cheap stocks.
3725 2018-01-06 03:30:29 This is not like stocks, you guys or only trading other peeps money.  There's no dividends in your coins lmao.
3726 2018-01-06 03:29:23 If he had his way, 80% ok f Americans would be in stocks.

3731 2018-01-06 03:26:16 The average person or "pensioner" makes very little as a result of stock market investments. The stats I saw today state that (1% of investors own 40% of stocks &) 10% of investors own 80% of stocks.  Thus, 90% of those involved in the stock market earn only 20% of the dividends.
3732 2018-01-06 03:25:44 Pot stocks falling on potential changes in US policy is a buying opportunity.  This might surprise some people; but there are economic markets not under US Jurisdiction *gasp*
3733 2018-01-06 03:24:36 Everybody that has an IRA or 401(k) owns stocks, moron!
3734 2018-01-06 03:23:56 NAKAKAINIS TALAGA YANG STOCKS I MEAN WE DONT NEED A BUSSINESS MAN AS FANTAGIO'S CEO 

WE NEED ASTRO, WEME AND FANTAGIO FAMILY's FATHER BACK
3735 2018-01-06 03:23:55 Thanks Chartseer. That’s what I meant! What kind of screen do you use to sort out these stocks? I’m trying to find my own system and stick to it for 2018.
3736 2018-01-06 03:23:17 Will try that thanks, I use the same one. I prefer using it on the daily rather than intraday cause its too choppy for stocks. Lower than daily timeframe is best for 23hr markets, which i think John Carter originally used it for.
3737 2018-01-06 03:23:16 Poor people don't own stocks dumbass
3738 2018-01-06 03:22:57 I bought into a few stocks, still struggling to buy in xrp ):
3739 2018-01-06 03:22:37 Good, I own stocks in my 401K, glad they will help make my retirement a fruitful one.
3740 2018-01-06 03:20:04 As long as you stick to your own style, you get the good and bad in your own approach. #trade #forex #stocks
3741 2018-01-06 03:19:43 Company’s stocks are valued on perceived market strength. Cash flow is an accounting term not an economic principle.  Ye gods.
3742 2018-01-06 03:19:15 That’s the problem with crypto. In stocks if a CEO buys or sells in can be tracked.
3743 2018-01-06 03:18:59 Says to listen to Roger Conrad and buy energy stocks.
3744 2018-01-06 03:18:32 Your closed minded approach to conversations like this are an example of why people think gun owners are ignorant.

I'm a gun owner myself & no attachments on an AR aren't standard bc I built mine myself by adding stocks, barrels, grips, sights etc

3746 2018-01-06 03:17:43 Wow. That much. The 18% of Americans who hold stocks must be happy. Pity about the 82% who are seeking NONE of this growth. Trickle down is a TRICK. Profits stay with the 1%.
3747 2018-01-06 03:16:28 If you are not +'VE in home equity,  stocks and crypto in 2018, wtf are you doing with your money!!
3748 2018-01-06 03:16:01 Google it , it’s a new of way of investing in electronic stocks
3749 2018-01-06 03:15:54 The stock market has nothing to do with jobs. Most average Americans do not own stocks. You realize those bonuses also lined up at the end of the year.Most people get bonuses over Christmas anyways.
3750 2018-01-06 03:15:01 LMAO!!!  I love watching post like this in desperation trying to unravel the extremely successful #Trump administration.  My 401k's and stocks are frigging magical right now. I could give a rat's anus about #liberal posts, or them screaming at the sky!  LMAO!! #MAGA..!!

3754 2018-01-06 03:12:39 Stagnant wages, lack of jobs, wage gaps and lack of income stops most of Americans from getting started in stocks. Additionally, the current bull market makes it more expensive for middle class families to "get started" gambling money they don't have in the stock market.
3755 2018-01-06 03:12:34 Weird day, especially with all these china stocks surging. I have a feeling you’re not alone.  Big mental break for me this weekend, too.  Full steam ahead on Monday!!  #Grit

Gud morning po sir Alvin and usec. Ruth, bakit agad tumaas price ng gasoline at diesel, di ba old stocks no price increase.
3773 2018-01-06 03:01:28 Is now a good time to mention only 4 in 10 Americans are invested in stocks mkt.? 401K is in the most conservative plan so it’s close to unchanged from last year. You?
3774 2018-01-06 03:00:51 Sometimes I just buy some stocks based on random tweets by random people I don’t even know. This sounded good though Jarrad, I hope you’re right haha.
3775 2018-01-06 03:00:33 Takes a real crazy person to lower taxes, grow the GDP to levels that MSM said wouldn't be possible. Get N Korea to open up talks with S Korea. Put an end to ISIS strongholds. Stop spending our tax money on the U.N. instead of our own country. Get stocks to record highs. Insane.
3776 2018-01-06 03:00:26 Or just learn day trading in general. Much more profitable stocks than just crypto. 
3777 2018-01-06 02:59:40 $TRX CC’s are always the death blow to stocks and obviously that includes crypto. It was good news.
3778 2018-01-06 02:59:27 Jeff Sessions is obviously in the pockets of Big Parma. It's nuts as this point to roll back the clock. Cannabis stocks are even sold on stock exchange. Even prohibitionists knew when to quit.
3779 2018-01-06 02:58:44 2018 = stocks + coop 

ipon year for real.
3780 2018-01-06 02:58:32 The problem is I saw the real you are not. Yes I love stocks, I hate the new tax plan, and Isis is mainly being wiped out by forces due to Iraq, and Trump has really no credit for the Iraq thing, or airplanes not crashing.
3781 2018-01-06 02:55:55 Investing my money in stocks  ... Money longer 
3782 2018-01-06 02:55:29 The stock market & corp earnings have been going up since before djt was elected. Many of his tossed regs & tax “cuts” only recently happened. Global economy is humming, India & Japan doing very well. Stocks are affected by many things...beyond djt.
3783 2018-01-06 02:54:43 You are aware all the square states that voted for you don't have stocks, or they have less than there tooth counts
3784 2018-01-06 02:54:29 In stocks if we had a good gain we always tried to make it tell January to off set gains for next year, than sell so tax are in the next year.  But this is EPIC Gains thats why I was saying last month get ready for a bumpy January. Just my 2 cents 
@BitcoinJerry
3785 2018-01-06 02:53:27 watch that 2:30pm ramp up on some FANG stocks. They run up in the morning then drift lower or consolidate til the 2:30 time. It was spot on today.
3786 2018-01-06 02:50:19 Test audience rejected "Go to war you patriotic dumbass so my defense stocks split"
3787 2018-01-06 02:48:56 Going back to stocks,  broke Tony has not acceptable after this year
3788 2018-01-06 02:48:55 Ya, they're nuts.
You know every bit of steel made since the first nukes were fired is now contaminated with the trace radioactivity? For sensitive stuff they use old steel stocks.
Yes, they could get a Giger counter and test this for themselves. But they don't...
Conspiracy!
3789 2018-01-06 02:47:25 I would trade bump stocks for ioter ID at a Congressional deal....in a heartbeat.
3790 2018-01-06 02:47:21 Tonight you are talking on what the media is not covering.  How about talk about how the stock market may be overpriced?  Have you seen the CAPE index? -it's over 30.  Last time that happened was right before the great recession -overpriced stocks?
3791 2018-01-06 02:46:57 It’s like every other day I go on YouTube look at videos about stocks..
3792 2018-01-06 02:46:13 If you borrow $1.5 trillion and hand it over to corporations of course it will pop up on the balance sheet, and push valuations of stocks up. So the DJ, S&P are a beautiful measure of corporate welfare.
3793 2018-01-06 02:44:34 Best Years Start to the Stock Market in History. Many of You Listened to MSM and Sold Stocks in your Retirement Plan. Listening to MSNBC gets You Old and Broke.. #MSNBC #Hannity
3794 2018-01-06 02:44:24 What good are stocks if the company is tanking and they’re not getting behind you? He still walks away with more then he started out with. Up to UA to go to him with grand campaigns.
3795 2018-01-06 02:43:42 Yes, allowing a million illegals to cross the US border & paying for sex changes for transgenders & gifting billions to the Iran regime has "no" effect on them either. So when stocks rise, companies grow. They hire  people & give pay raises & lower prices. And lower taxes too.
3796 2018-01-06 02:43:41 The dow is great, yes. My stocks are loving it! But to be fair, the stocks have been climbing for the last 5 yrs. Trump may have had a tad to do with it, but the only Legislative win he's had was tax reform. The economy is good because its left from Obama policy. I'll wait a year
3797 2018-01-06 02:43:40 Btw, Trump's FDA took a swipe at tobacco stocks, causing me to lose about $30K in one day earlier this year.

3798 2018-01-06 02:42:16 It is very rare for the price of a house to drop, while it is quite common for prices of stocks to drop.
3799 2018-01-06 02:41:48 TD Ameritrade is butts, not getting alerts and their watchlist is awful, constantly not saving most of the stocks I add... eesh. Wonder if other people have the same issues.
3800 2018-01-06 02:41:36 It is easier to diversify investment with a small amount in stocks. Same is not possible in real estate. You need large amount of money to diversify real estate investment. However the right property purchase is a surer and better guarantor of appreciation than any stock.
3801 2018-01-06 02:41:16 Lol, what she finally realized her stocks just doubled , darn head piece must have been on to tight.

3806 2018-01-06 02:38:31 I've seen several investment geniuses well-recognized that said he would be wealthier if he had put his money into stocks and not tried to meddle in business personally, he's a bozo the declares bankruptcy constantly to get out of paying debts, now he is bankrupting America

3810 2018-01-06 02:35:40 Investing in wheelbarrow stocks... everyone will need one to pay their internet bill....
3811 2018-01-06 02:33:45 That’s only good for half of Americans that have stocks! So.... so what. Go eat a Big Mac or something.
3812 2018-01-06 02:33:15 Um-bus investments could mean anything from new equipment to remodeling not specific to personnel (like car makers). stock investments isn’t cash on hand for goods and it can be used to reinvest in STOCKS to increase share value instead which benefits the corporation not staff.
3813 2018-01-06 02:32:00 Stocks are my game. ;)

3819 2018-01-06 02:28:58 Alan is right insofar as his analogy to penny stocks.  Akin to Phineas Taylor Barnum One of Barnum's more successful methods of self-promotion was mass publication of his autobiography.

3823 2018-01-06 02:26:13 Empirical evidence over long term in many economies has found that putting that money in stocks has always outperformed appreciation + rent savings of owing a house. Of course it doesn’t count psychological comfort.
3824 2018-01-06 02:21:47 I doubt that the average Trump supporter is focused on their stocks.
3825 2018-01-06 02:21:29 OK there is no stopping this train - we had said buy buy buy and we expected some profit taking - but no one cares. It is "All the Way UP"". This feels just like the 1999-2000 bubble. Until rates go higher - FANG stocks are breaking out.
3826 2018-01-06 02:20:48 No-wages are determined by demand and retention/ hiring needs - not production. More spending and low unemployment should increase wages -it hasn’t- because profit is being sent to stocks and business investments.
3827 2018-01-06 02:18:27 Corporations with help of an incompetent president think we R not capable of understanding only 10% richest own majority of stocks 84% of stocks so why should American Workers B happy or care 4 stock market it doesn’t trickle down that is a Mythical trump/Hatch/Ryan fairytale

3830 2018-01-06 02:16:14 Nice more stock buy backs and dividend increases. Companies have been sitting on record piles of cash for years it’s not a new phenomena. Only around 40% of population own stocks or mutual funds unfortunately.

3836 2018-01-06 02:12:19 Where'd you get those statistics from? And assuming they are accurate, what about the other 20% of stocks owned by working class citizens? Your disdain for the rich blinds you from the fact that those people are being helped financially.

3854 2018-01-06 02:01:23 i lost the equal of a small hatch in motor trade stocks today on the back of it
3855 2018-01-06 02:00:43 What about bump stocks?
3856 2018-01-06 01:58:03 that's me every time someone says "poors should just invest in stocks to see Trump benefits!" 
3857 2018-01-06 01:57:46 You still live in the United States? Hey Babs, have you checked your savings or stocks or 401ks? I bet you wont tell us how good they are doing!! #maga
3858 2018-01-06 01:57:24 Dear #Lowes the #TaxReform is benefiting Lowes greatly with stocks going up, hit us up with a bonus. Love Matt (OutSide Lawn and Garden)
3859 2018-01-06 01:56:34 Don’t want to speak too soon but, short selling might actually be making a come back. Stocks trading in opposite direction of the January effect earlier this year. No multi day holds $CNET $CNIT $DELT
3860 2018-01-06 01:54:29 The Fusion Super Bull Market has been very rewarding, but current Stage 2 can be even better. But most will miss it again. Why? Wrong valuation models, resort to trading and big bets, seek big gains in areas outside of stocks.. history will repeat..
3861 2018-01-06 01:52:47 Seeing the national job work week is 31 hrs a week. And less than 50% of Americans own stocks. Econ still sucks 4 joe blow
3862 2018-01-06 01:51:38 I would cash in any stocks I had. It would be safer in your mattress than in the hands of these people.
3863 2018-01-06 01:51:16 better then stocks but still not a good idee if you don't know what you are doing
3864 2018-01-06 01:50:47 @POTUS has been a better stocks president than Presidents Clinton, H.W. Bush, W. Bush, Reagan, Carter, Ford, Nixon, LBJ, Kennedy, Eisenhower, Coolidge, Hoover, Taft, Wilson, McKinley, and Harding! Can't wait to see how he will continue making it grow in #2018! #Trump #POTUS #MAGA
3865 2018-01-06 01:50:07 Sana dumating na stocks nung 5s para mabili ko na ngayon. Nababagot nako hahaha
3866 2018-01-06 01:49:23 Pffft lotto......401K and stocks.............cha chingggggggg........Oh and that hefty sign on bonus to come out if retirement cuz ya know ,they have the cash to throw at me now...... Sweet
3867 2018-01-06 01:48:29 Yeah, the stock market boom is a bad thing. So is owning stocks.  Makes sense.
3868 2018-01-06 01:43:29 Patiently waiting for these new tires so I can burn down my stocks 
3869 2018-01-06 01:42:31 Sin stocks cancer is cancer
3870 2018-01-06 01:41:23 Hey Chip, could you please explain the connection between cars and trucks, which are designed to carry people and goods; and bump stocks, which are designed to increase the firing rate of a lethal weapon. Just curious.
3871 2018-01-06 01:41:12 Al Gore bought company stocks, spread false climate rumors, driving up stock price, then sold for $100 million profit.  If I did that, the US SEC would imprison me for 20 years for securities fraud. To the US SEC:  Please investigate Al Gore for securities fraud. @SEC_News #SEC
3872 2018-01-06 01:41:03 Stocks do not equal jobs
3873 2018-01-06 01:40:13 my stocks are up today and i got paid and my stronghold is lvl 11 on king of avalon 
3874 2018-01-06 01:39:21 It was down 10% today. Why would play a high spec biotech based on options flow? So many other healthier stocks to play based on bullish options flow.
3875 2018-01-06 01:39:16 Only reason go up cnbc talks about them   check out exel outperformed all gang stocks last yaer$amzn
3876 2018-01-06 01:39:16 No, he doesn't.  This was written about a few months ago when Sessions reduced prosecutor discretion in charging for drug crimes.  Sessions owns shares in mutual funds that own some private prison stocks.  Direct personal profit is not his motive here.
3877 2018-01-06 01:38:53 People I've met from both Iran and Pakistan are very intelligent.

3878 2018-01-06 01:38:15 $CBGH Bring on the updates and PR’s baby! @WritMedia $WRIT
3879 2018-01-06 01:37:46 Good day for $INPX 22% from open. Sadly got out way too soon. #stocks #NASDAQ #inpx
3880 2018-01-06 01:36:57 It’s 2018 either you travel the world with me and invest stocks or I don’t want to deal with you  no games no more with you niggas
3881 2018-01-06 01:35:20 What's Behind This Marijuana Stock Soaring 81.5% in December? | Business Markets and Stocks News #MMJ #CBD -
3882 2018-01-06 01:35:16 Woohoo! No one cares about stocks except you and a few of your cronies. Most off the@people that voted for you don’t have stocks. You can’t buy food or raise kids with them and that is all most people are concerned with. So enjoy while it lasts.
3883 2018-01-06 01:35:12 A lot of the 'value' created by the Dow isn't actually from anything productive, it is just rich people speculating. 

The Dow is just a measure of inequality because stocks are owned by the 1%.
3884 2018-01-06 01:33:23 Next stage. Ludicrous mode. #stocks
3885 2018-01-06 01:33:13 No tengo dudas. Oil en backwardation, recortes de opec todo el 2018. Fallas en los stocks EIA. Todas las petroleras están saneando deudas y reestructurándose. Muchas iniciaron exploraciones offshore. Me gusta mucho el sector.
3886 2018-01-06 01:32:57 Because everyone needs to gamble with their money. Why invest in stocks when you can bet on hockey and double up every night.
3887 2018-01-06 01:32:40 These right wing conservative fuckwits are barefaced liars. Do not believe a single word that comes from a Republican's lips #Trump #TrumpTrain #TrumpRussia #POTUS #DonaldTrump #MAGA #gop #FakeNews #Dow25K #WallStreet #DJIA #NASDAQ #StockMarket #stocks #401k #Republicans
3888 2018-01-06 01:32:36 Many thanks, parents are scared of crypto but do play stocks. I got them in at 42$ because of your post and it’s doubled in a month.
3889 2018-01-06 01:31:47 @TuckerCarlson If you could check the portfolio’s of the Politicians as well as Leftist Elitist trying to shove Global Warming that was changed to Climate Change when we froze our asses off several yrs ago on us,I’d bet their all heavily invested in stocks that’ll benefit.
3890 2018-01-06 01:31:17 The why 'Mr.T' calls the media fake and Admires himself to be the best P to have achieved a big stocks rise??
3891 2018-01-06 01:30:37 My stocks on weed just went down because of Jeff fucking Sessions. I’m so mad, I’m so mad, I’m just gonna take a joint right now and sit here in my sofa with some popcorn.  Aaaand I should be good.
3892 2018-01-06 01:29:54 Hi Greg.
Building sand is getting scarce.
Any stocks recommened from the tribe.
One under radar here
@gregorymckenna
3893 2018-01-06 01:29:28 And btw HomeDepot just announced its spending $15 billion of its new savings from the tax cut and its increased profits on... BUYING BACK STOCKS which will singularly add wealth to executives and primary stockholders...
3894 2018-01-06 01:27:54 Not with the puny amount Ive invested so far. But weed stocks are working out pretty well for me :)
3895 2018-01-06 01:27:14 Nuclear games to sell food stocks? #Meltdown
3896 2018-01-06 01:27:02 I’ve seen you’ve grown up from the name calling. Invest in stocks and you’ll agree with me
3897 2018-01-06 01:26:47 When wages actually keep up with productivity again, then Trump will be kicking ass, until then I'm waiting for America to be great because the stock market isn't going to change anything when most stocks are held by the 1%.
3898 2018-01-06 01:26:21 MAGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I dont have any stocks
3899 2018-01-06 01:25:31 thanks again for Trump.  and where is my recount money that you had left over   $50.00   or did you put it in your portfolio full of war stocks?
3900 2018-01-06 01:25:29 Is there a rule of thumb for pull back ? I see lots of stocks running lately , someone mentioned if it runs 3 days in a row there will be a big pull back ( entry point ) what’s good rule of thumb ? #StockMarket #PENNYSTOCKS #tfsa #potsector
3901 2018-01-06 01:25:13 Mega-sized everything today! Available at both our outlets while stocks last. @ Dishthefish
3902 2018-01-06 01:24:28 Stocks are over valued because corps have run up prices with buy backs using all the cash the have accumulated on the backs of working class.  Low jobs, low wages, no benefits, layoffs, loop holes.  No employer with employees on assistance should get a tax break at all, Walmart
3903 2018-01-06 01:23:30 I still said passing this bill was a conflict of interest and a conspiracy against the American people's especially senators and congressmen's the ones who voted for this bill that has stocks and bonds in the stock market to benefit from it should not have voted on this bill !
3904 2018-01-06 01:22:42 @jimcramer Maybe even have a branch off into potential option trades to play on your daily rundown or bullpen stocks. That would be a really nice addition to action alerts plus. A section dedicated for option as a branch to your portfolio. Just suggestions
3905 2018-01-06 01:22:37 Using a rough calculation:

If each point in S&P 500 is worth about $9 billion in market capitalization.

What exactly added $630 billion since Tuesday?

To that point, what added $100 billion in market cap since noon?

A 50k miss on a Jobs report?

#trading #investing #stocks
3906 2018-01-06 01:21:34 Because, they know why it is. You deregulated, and your rich friends are buying up all the stocks. This just means rich get richer, but average citizens still struggle. Big O did not need to brag about his wealth,
3907 2018-01-06 01:21:15 Sure, but everyone else is a small portion of the market, and according to the study only 27% of "middle class" (20-80th percentile) has more than $10K invested in stocks. The market is mostly a rich man's game.
3908 2018-01-06 01:20:21 2 accounts that deserve a shout-out for their knowledge, wisdom and sharing of great research and insight on stocks are @realTheProphet and @HamzahKingKhan ... #respect #blessed #Happy2018
3909 2018-01-06 01:17:05 Sadly heavy regulations is almost here in #Crypto, so the golden years are coming to a close. Its going to get co-opted and turned into stocks/bonds/everything else. So get while the getting is good. #steemit
3910 2018-01-06 01:16:30 Invest in apple stocks and get money!

3914 2018-01-06 01:13:20 I feel so sorry for new ppl to the Crypto space RN. Can you imagine having to shop for stocks if 98% of the NYSE were scams. My advice: carefully select an OG mentor or 2 & trust them until you understand the landscape. 1/2
3915 2018-01-06 01:13:00 Trying out acorn, what’s some good marijuana stocks 
3916 2018-01-06 01:12:39 @BigBirdofBayst I’m looking at adding to my position of $loto on Monday .. is $0.25 a good entry point , remember I’m very new at this and just wondering what you think a healthy pull back is for stocks that have run. Is there a rule of thumb for pull backs ?
3917 2018-01-06 01:12:30 Continue to prepare for significantly higher markets. We have keyed heavily on growth stocks-expect to continue this pursuit-many cyclicals are acting well
3918 2018-01-06 01:11:15 Kendall, lives on Catalina Canyon with too many parrots.

Put all their savings into pickle stocks. Can't retire.
3919 2018-01-06 01:11:00 Great returns on the markets in the first week of the year. Jolly thrilled with the performance of most of my picks. In 2018 I am very bullish on Canadian lithium miners, banking, private wealth, fibre-optic laser chips and e-commerce stocks. I may reluctantly add XRP. GLTA!
3920 2018-01-06 01:10:22 Could be the reason why all my stocks flow today lol
3921 2018-01-06 01:09:38 Ratio of no of stocks on NSE hitting 52 week high and 52 week low is disproptionately high. Market has froth. Retail investors need to exercise caution and respect SL.
3922 2018-01-06 01:09:23 Gop is all in on the trump train!  We will vote them all out because trump’s base is a solid 32%...jobs numbers for December are disappointing his approval will drop more when those big stocks and tax breaks don’t equate to $$$ for the middle class
3923 2018-01-06 01:09:15 One of the scariest things is being off stage against a Falco that has more stocks than you
3924 2018-01-06 01:08:43 Ratio of no of stocks on NSE hitting 52 week high and 52 week low is disproptionately high. Market has froth. Retail investors need to exercise caution and respect SL.
3925 2018-01-06 01:08:16 This country is so fugged. The idea (and it’s only a dang idea!) of shareholders first is ruining employment. Companies used to be a hard won deal between employer and employee, but now that is sacrificed for the cancerous growth of stocks for the benefit of shareholders.
3926 2018-01-06 01:06:54 Further A) it shows *some* stocks doing well. Not all stocks listed on the Dow. B) it’s an index/composite. C) about 1/2 of Amns own stocks (I was surprised this high, but includes retirement accts. Since learned about 15% directly own.)

3929 2018-01-06 01:05:12 You and your little Elf Sessions, made all my stocks drop by 39% with you rescinding Obama’s Cold Agreement re; Cannabis. Is there any group that you haven’t alienated yet?
3930 2018-01-06 01:05:02 Ok FREE TRIALS for the new OPTIONS FLOW and the stocks and all chatrooms start NOW. Hit me up
3931 2018-01-06 01:04:27 The percentage of stocks owned by m/c Americans is large because of corporate 401K stock plans. I can tell you pensions, which have often been discarded since Reagan, are much, much better. Have we all forgotten 2008 which caused panic selling of stocks? Pensons are stable.
3932 2018-01-06 01:03:50 I'm not a big pot person, but I'm wondering what the federal govt is doing spending so much time & energy on this issue. Does Sessions own prison stocks or something? Are the police badgering him to maintain their jobs? A tax issue? State govts threatening on other levels?
3933 2018-01-06 01:03:37 @askGST_GoI @GST_Council sir in view of the judgment of the honourable High Court of Delhi on closing stocks kindly provide the Tran 1 facility once again to claim the transitional relief. President APTPCA
3934 2018-01-06 01:03:23 Ahh i see.. Sana mgkarun ulit ng stocks
3935 2018-01-06 01:02:24 I know it looks bad, but precisely bc of these situations high rank officers have strict controls over stocks at intel. This transaction could have been automated/programmed and we are just assuming. And besides the stock is not that low it's still better than most of last year!

3943 2018-01-06 00:57:28 Oh that’s annoying, dunno if I should tell him Arsenes a dead manger, that’s Arsenal’s boards awful or that the fans are some of the biggest laughing stocks on the internet because of AFTV
3944 2018-01-06 00:57:19 Hoping to expand and diversify our portfolio this year..... a lot of tech stocks currently. Advice is welcomed!
3945 2018-01-06 00:57:13 Stocks rising, literally.
3946 2018-01-06 00:56:24 Ill take higher wages for all over great stocks for rich any day. That would truly boost spending and happiness of americans instead of select view. Its good stocks are going up but wages need to as well
3947 2018-01-06 00:55:39 I know but I don't want to chase any stocks... prefer to buy at a dip but for this one, I guess I may change my mind next monday 
3948 2018-01-06 00:55:16 If you’re interested in investing in cannabis stocks, Jeff Sessions sure can create a buying opportunity.
3949 2018-01-06 00:54:23 Same tg ggamit te hahahaha. Sa abreeza te sa healty options gud pero as of now wala pa daw last december pako naghulat nga mag abot ilang stocks 
3950 2018-01-06 00:53:59 Hmmm it's like stocks but not stocks...basically it's currency not tied to any central bank nor country hence can be used sort of to buy anything from anywhere in the world from people who sees it as money as well
3951 2018-01-06 00:53:46 Also, unless you sell your stocks, it’s not *really* money in your pocket. What’s he going to tweet when there’s a correction?
3952 2018-01-06 00:53:14 Great for the stocks.  BUT, NOT HAPPY WITH SOCIAL SECURITY.  INCREASE IN BENEFIT BY 1.95%, BUT INCREASE IN MEDICARE OF 20%!!!  SO, THE NET TO MY POCKET EACH MONTH IS 0.09%.  THANKS FOR ALMOST NOTHING - AGAIN!!!
3953 2018-01-06 00:53:01 I wouldnt say mad at, but it is not a great actual representation of  how typical americans are doing when top 10% owns 80%+ of stocks. Our  wages are shit and havent increased with profits at all.
3954 2018-01-06 00:52:58 You nailed it Mark... He's been amazing!!! Stocks up 16 points...people actually believe and want to believe in our great nation and just what we can do as a people for our children and their children!! Those of us deplorabes that refuse to believe in anyone else but ourselves!!!
3955 2018-01-06 00:52:42 Agree.He’s rich from stocks in defense&threatens attacking Iran too often for my liking.Not keeping shameless psycho Erik Prince at bay too.
3956 2018-01-06 00:51:22 #stocks Real chart and fundamental guys know you base your moves on %ages, not #’s.
3957 2018-01-06 00:51:08 Your republican talking points are noted.  Here are facts:  
--Trump job creation in 2017 is 15% lower than Obama in 2016.  
--The stock market only matters to 10% of Americans who own stocks; others care when they retire.
--Business creation at lowest rate in 40 years
3958 2018-01-06 00:50:37 hahaha try lang. ano ba un? di me marunong sa stocks hehehe
3959 2018-01-06 00:49:46 During the 1920s, U.S. stock market underwent rapid expansion, peaking August 1929, after a wild speculation. By then, production declined & high unemployment left stocks in excess of their real value. Causes were low wages, debt, struggling agricultural and large bank loans.
3960 2018-01-06 00:49:20 In addition, stocks are overvalued and will come crashing down like a rollercoaster. Nothing is tied to gold and all monopoly money
3961 2018-01-06 00:49:18 It was a China name that had not made a move with the other China stocks.  The news was just luck to be honest.
3962 2018-01-06 00:48:53 Those are among 2 which lifted the stock market this year. And Trump showed favoritism to. 

The Dow is not equally weighted-certain stocks have more worth than others.Take out the top 5 and we wouldn’t be at record levels. Boeing, United Technology, 3M, Caterpillar, Home Depot
3963 2018-01-06 00:47:55 VICE News on HBO just reported SAME things about the stock market that I've been saying:

only 1/2 of adult Americans are in the market
80% of stocks are owned by top 10% richest people

Trump doesn't get why most Americans are not jumping up and down along with him on this one
3964 2018-01-06 00:47:33 Might be a good idea soon to pick up and hold #cannabis stocks.
3965 2018-01-06 00:47:14 Wouldn’t. First thing, I’d spread it between stocks and bonds as Ben Fischer advised for stable income, then live off the return. Pay the house off.
3966 2018-01-06 00:47:14 cool have not seen the crypto heat map - just stocks before TY :)
3967 2018-01-06 00:47:00 Yea keeping thousands of my own tax dollars for the next 9 years, retirement accounts crushing it, stocks market flying high, growth up 3%+, unemployment at 8 year low.... yes losing!! The left thinks success is bad so I see why ur confused
3968 2018-01-06 00:47:00 Fri Mkt Wrap: Have a great weekend all! Bond market closed Friday’s session mod in red at $102.50, -9bps. Stocks rallied notching their best start to a year since 2006. #MyLoanGuyGreg #BetterCallGreg
3969 2018-01-06 00:46:18 Gotta invest in stocks once I graduate and have money to spare
3970 2018-01-06 00:46:16 The worst thing about the annual federal "OGE 450 financial disclosure time" is facing you've gone another year without having any stocks and/or assets to disclose because you may not be an actual adult.
3971 2018-01-06 00:45:50 I'm liking trading the bitcoin stocks $OSTK & $xnet, $riot rocket as well. Even $SQ

3973 2018-01-06 00:45:45 The 10% of the wealthiest Americans own over 80% of all stocks. The stock market being up means very little to most Americans. They will not see any real gains. The stock market is also likely in a bubble that will ultimately burst, & when it does, it will affect most negatively.
3974 2018-01-06 00:45:38 I haven't figured this one out yet. If you invested in most firms at the start of the NYSE, only a few such as GE and Pfizer still be good assets 3 generations later.

Some older stocks would still be OK as acquired businesses in current concerns.

3976 2018-01-06 00:43:14 @MrCryptoes Hi Alistair, I've been reading your posts and you seem to combine common sense/DD + some TA skills. I used to trade Canadian penny stocks back when I was in college to pay for my trips (and beers of course) using a similar approach as yours. Reason for this message
3977 2018-01-06 00:43:01 40% of Americans own stocks and it costs next to nothing to participate. People make choices.
3978 2018-01-06 00:42:52 I AM a progressive because I am aware of American & world economic history & grasp that redistributing more wealth to the wealthy & ignoring middle class ( as happens in USA)  creates political chaos & instability. Time to dump your stocks!!
3979 2018-01-06 00:42:00 3 stocks, bumpers on high, wii fit trainer dittos on smashville
3980 2018-01-06 00:41:57 Amen. If you are a real working American, how does the stock market affect you? It does help my retirement 403b; however, when I asked my broker if I should increase  my investment into more stocks, he said, "Ah, no. When it's this high, that means it's going to fall soon."
3981 2018-01-06 00:41:09 Why, do you believe in supply-side economics? Otherwise, most economists don’t think businesses will use tax cuts to expand & hire new workers. Will pay dividends, raise CEO pay & buy back stocks. No increase in DEMAND for goods as tax cuts for individuals was paltry.
3982 2018-01-06 00:40:53 So when Trump goes out to middle rural America for his rallies and starts trouting the stock market gains under his administration; does he know most of those people don't own stocks of any kind? Not even a 401k.
3983 2018-01-06 00:40:31 While I wait for my penny stocks to perk, $XLM has made me some coin this week...no pun intended!

3984 2018-01-06 00:40:26 They're actually rather universal. I've seen them on steering columns and rifle stocks in several Grand Forks county locales.
3985 2018-01-06 00:40:24 Also, for this "forgotten people" out there - How many of you own stocks?  The Dow rise is pretty much rich folks getting richer.

3987 2018-01-06 00:37:38 Great she can give birth during a sitting in the House, Trudeau can shed a few years and Morneau can sell present the baby with stocks in his business... Now onto real business....
3988 2018-01-06 00:36:51 51% of Americans 36 to 51 are in the stock market.  Can’t buy stocks under 18. 48% 51 + are in the market. It’s called a 401k
3989 2018-01-06 00:36:45 23 Thunder Stocks 
22 Street Stock
Glads & Outlaws and still a line to register!!!! Going to be good get here
3990 2018-01-06 00:36:21 The oil prices track up and down in real time. You can follow them on the Internet just like stocks and cryptocurrency values, and you can buy futures in it. The bigger buyers get better discounts, and there are different grades of petrol, diesel, etc.
Adding 2p a litre though?!
3991 2018-01-06 00:35:16 Yeah only your 1% gang is going to mostly profit from this... not most of Americans!! My stocks are the same- so nope u didnt do anything
3992 2018-01-06 00:35:05 Downloaded this Robinhood app .. Bout to get bizzy with these Stocks
3993 2018-01-06 00:34:45 Agreed. But somewhat generous re: Whitaker. Plenty wanted him sacked as a selector before he was even chairman of selectors! I wanted to put him in the stocks and chuck rancid feta at him too. It would be harsh but very fair
3994 2018-01-06 00:34:43 45%of all Americans have nothing invested in stocks!!  So it diesnt matter to HALF the people you twit
3995 2018-01-06 00:34:11 Lol I hear ya!! I have a household of 5 with 3 teenagers to boot...lots of this going on #momlife  I need to buy stocks in Tide Company  #KeepingThemInBusiness
3996 2018-01-06 00:33:05 Competition is a drug, and so is emotional challenge. The adjustment period is cruel on retiring athletes, or even coaches. It's in their blood. They can't get the same buzz playing golf or trading stocks or creating a winery.
3997 2018-01-06 00:30:54 Definitely earmarking that "Fire and Fury" book as my second read of the new year.

Or at least as soon as the bookstores here stocks up on that particular title anyways...
3998 2018-01-06 00:30:23 I agree. No more technical opinions from me. Facts only. Investors should decide based on the facts. :)
3999 2018-01-06 00:30:06 Stocks are going up now because your giving away the house and corps know that you don’t read and will sign anything put on your desk.
4000 2018-01-06 00:29:40 What pot stocks do you like north of the border?  Aphqf?@jimcramer
4001 2018-01-06 00:29:35 The poor and most working class do not have the financial security to invest in stocks. This is why any boost in the stock market is irrelevant to these folks. #DoseOfRealityForTheDumbassTrumpAdministration
4002 2018-01-06 00:29:10 Most American's us middle class you just raped with your tax cuts, we don't have stock only your rich friends do - you saved them so much $ they are buying stocks with $ to burn. You need to retire.
4003 2018-01-06 00:28:50 That’s great @realDonaldTrump  but I don’t have stocks or bonds and I don’t know anyone who does so how does that help me? When I see it in my paycheck we can talk about sticks but till then no one cares
4004 2018-01-06 00:28:43 Good grief you hated Bannon months ago. And I can’t get Obama care in my area. Non existent. Stop the all caps, screaming. Do you favor the rise in stocks?
4005 2018-01-06 00:28:36 Probably had lots of time to tour shops if you sold your stocks with INSIDER INFORMATION!
4006 2018-01-06 00:26:49 He and most everyone else wrong on everything when it came to Trump. Few thought he had a chance&most predicted "economic disaster" even though it was obvious a Prez pro business intent to de-reg would have stocks booming. I predicted 30,000 by end of 2018..should be there sooner
4007 2018-01-06 00:26:37 Will keep an eye out for this, thank you for sentiment analysis on $HIVE $BLOK $BLOC gents. I do share the feeling there will be a rotation back to these blockchain/crypto stocks. It's all a popularity contest!
4008 2018-01-06 00:26:06 Don't mean to come off harsh. I follow you because I appreciate your posts and view you as legit. There's just so much trash on Twitter and people with agendas that I have to call it out sometimes. I think you're better than that post

4010 2018-01-06 00:23:53 When market went down 600 points at news of his win, the MC tweeted at that moment the market would roar with @potus in office. Hope many took my advice and bought stocks like they were going out of style.
4011 2018-01-06 00:23:18 You got that right Frank! It's ok, I just bought a bunch more for when this thing runs!
4012 2018-01-06 00:23:08 Talk about this Senator!

4014 2018-01-06 00:19:40 No one is stopping anyone from getting started in stocks .
4015 2018-01-06 00:19:07 Presumably the stocks don't control our twitter account?
4016 2018-01-06 00:18:56 Yea, uh, everything here in America still requires USD. So, thanks, but I’ll keep some of that too because I like owning a house, car, stocks, food, clothes, electronics, etc.
4017 2018-01-06 00:18:33 @OddStockTrader Do you talk about the stocks/coins you're in on the IU chat before posting on Twitter?
4018 2018-01-06 00:17:47 This is hilarious! I actually own stocks and my portfolio has skyrocketed since Trump was elected after sitting dormant for 8 years...isn't that funny? Keep watching CNN!
4019 2018-01-06 00:17:03 (2) "The market moves mirror the tech bubble, when many stocks saw a dramatic price surge after adding "dot-com" to their names.

A paper published in 2000 through Purdue University found the dot-com name changes began around June 1998 and ...”
4020 2018-01-06 00:16:54 it amazing how OBAMA and the DNC are trying to take credit for the economic growth we have seen the jobs market as well as stocks under their watch excuse we enhariteted all these things that keep getting worse 4 the next 8 yrs TRUMP turned that around you might want to take note
4021 2018-01-06 00:16:30 these stocks are boooomin  $ACB $WEED
4022 2018-01-06 00:15:31 (1) "Regardless, investors will need to be extremely cautious about companies making announcements related to cryptocurrencies and adding "blockchain" to their name. Some tiny stocks have soared on such changes, prompting regulators to issue warnings about potential scams."
4023 2018-01-06 00:15:07 @sainsburys I keep seeing articles that u r sticking hopla vegan squirty cream but I can't find a branch in Birmingham/solihull that stocks it.They look at me like I'm mad when I ask.My vegan daughter really misses it & I'd love to make her a proper hot choc for her 13th bday
4024 2018-01-06 00:14:20 Yes, please. Will buy after the pullback. In fact, I will short stocks when it pulls back.
4025 2018-01-06 00:12:07 the stocks breaking record highs.Dow broke the record first time in history.Your charts are wrong we had experts look them over and wonder where did you get the charts from
4026 2018-01-06 00:12:04 Looks like @MadCatz is active again now according to their FB and they are at CES .. pretty sure it doesn't relate to $MCZAF tho.. but i'm not very familiar with how previously BK stocks work
4027 2018-01-06 00:10:40 Everything is down n the stock market is up because the corporations are buying their own stocks.
4028 2018-01-06 00:09:58 In case you are too stupid to comprehend this let me break it down for you Donny, the average American does not own stocks because they can’t afford it. You have no idea what the average American does or has. All you care about is making yourself and friends richer.
4029 2018-01-06 00:08:15 Well, I’m glad the corporations, the Shareholders & Wealthy made out under Donnie! Seeing as how they’re the only ones who own stocks or benefit from them! #Fool
4030 2018-01-06 00:07:30 The growth in economy is not Measured by the rise in the stock index. The "value creation" that you mentioned is only for the few who invested in stocks and not for the general people.
4031 2018-01-06 00:07:27 Who Know About Stocks  asking For Myself 
4032 2018-01-06 00:07:12 Btw. Principles could be used on any investment beit real estate, stocks, business etc
4033 2018-01-06 00:07:10 Oh I’ve done my research. Their stock didn’t go up just because of the solar city buyout.  If stocks went up, it because Tesla was a stronger company after it. If it was a bad deal, stocks would have dropped significantly.
4034 2018-01-06 00:06:52 Just checked on my stocks Investing was great decision for me. It’s going to pay off  #Thankful
4035 2018-01-06 00:06:21 His tax plan reduces corporate income taxes for small and large businesses alike increasing profited, increasing stocks, increasing dividends, increasing money given to employees for ALL corporate businesses
4036 2018-01-06 00:05:29 I'm getting ready to move my 401k out of stocks.
4037 2018-01-06 00:05:18 HEY DUMBASS. YOU ARE SO EXCRUCIATINGLY IGNORANT. 
 4 in 10 Americans, 43 percent, own stocks. This includes 51 percent of people who are 36 to 51 years old (Generation X), and 48 percent of Baby Boomers, who are aged 52 to 70.
4038 2018-01-06 00:05:12 I understand that but also if you are thinking about generational wealth to pass down then some of your stocks need to be long term investments.
4039 2018-01-06 00:04:02 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
4040 2018-01-06 00:03:38 The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq notched their best weekly gains in more than a year on Friday as technology stocks helped raise major indexes to records.
It was the strongest start to a year for all three major indexes since 2013.

4045 2018-01-06 00:00:37 The Markets is more than the DOW. Much more than 30 Stocks and it has gone up a blistering rate this year. Sorry to say that Democrats. Those investing for retirement are very happy.

4049 2018-01-05 23:58:00 All jokes aside, it's generally good to buy into "uptrend" vs. buying on the way down.  Stocks tend to fall even lower immediately following a correction.

4051 2018-01-05 23:55:58 True, Tesla is spending huge amounts of money doing different things (giga factory, new vehicle models, acquiring solar city.) however, their stocks are at $316 because people believe in the product and what it will mean for the future. Tesla is leading the way in EV’s.

4054 2018-01-05 23:55:16 Some of us may. Saying that it  in ANY way differs from stocks, forex or any other investment vehicle is just ludicrous. The risks are identical, yet the potential for gains are astronomically higher.

4057 2018-01-05 23:54:39 This financial show starring @cvpayne is a joke. They claim to "make you money" yet this guy never provides any analysis as to what stocks to invest in for the future. He just states what already happened and tries to tie it to Republucan values 
4058 2018-01-05 23:53:12 It's also the psychological run away point from $1.00 for most fast moving stocks. The official bye-bye point
4059 2018-01-05 23:52:47 Except when it comes to children covered by CHIP, folks covered by the ACA, and half of all Americans that do not own stocks. You can sit down and shut up now.
4060 2018-01-05 23:51:52 Doesn't help those who don't own stocks!

4063 2018-01-05 23:51:18 *smh* Arguing that the middle-class don't benefit from their 401Ks/stocks going up just because a guy who owns a shit-ton benefits more is so preposterous as to be insulting.

4082 2018-01-05 23:50:51 DONALD, do not focus on Stocks. They will go UP in 2019-2020 with Healthy business environment provided. Now focus on Infrastructure repairs and renewal, the Wall, Migration policy, Guns' control, International Trade, Defense Shield, Development of Lasers. Act wisely. Rgds.
4083 2018-01-05 23:50:50 I work on Wall St., idiot - rising stocks do NOTHING for the poor and vast majority of the middle class, unless they're day traders.
4084 2018-01-05 23:50:22 I have an instant pot and I adore it so much. I can't have storebought stock, so it's saved me a lot of time and energy making stocks.
4085 2018-01-05 23:49:59 @MarijuanaIndex reporting the United States Index of #MarijuanaStocks was up 11.3% today. That's great, considering the blood bath yesterday.
4086 2018-01-05 23:49:18 Nice try Dorkin. Majority of stocks are in retirement mutual funds owned by...guess who... pension fund companies...who sell to...guess who...the average working American.  #meathead @robreiner
4087 2018-01-05 23:48:57 Buy me stocks so I know it's real...
4088 2018-01-05 23:48:33 As long as my Aurora Cannibas Company stocks are ok, I’m ok.
4089 2018-01-05 23:48:27 Just reminding you that only 50% of Americans own stocks. So while it is good for the 50% who own stocks.. the other 50% who don’t—-not so much.
4090 2018-01-05 23:48:08 Ahhhh how long is this deal available for?? + question, how long until poser paste expires? cause honestly i might have to build up stocks then haha

4094 2018-01-05 23:45:58 Great list.
4095 2018-01-05 23:45:46 I am disappointed in @etrade. Too often, I check my penny stocks after the closing bell, and they are entirely wrong. Pretty disappointing that I have to look at other finance websites to see where my stocks closed at. How can I fix this?
4096 2018-01-05 23:45:43 Stocks have been going up since 2008.  This is a continuation, granted an excellent one. My 34 year job has managing money for the wealthy.
4097 2018-01-05 23:45:25 Cannabis stocks did take a shit because of Sessions' announcement to "crack down" on LEGAL herb. Sad!
4098 2018-01-05 23:45:16 I'm putting money in stocks and my future business, and you're acting worried about what I got on my Twitter. Who's more focused?

4106 2018-01-05 23:41:59 I'll be honest, I don't typically post stuff like that. People who message me privately will mention it, so I figured I'd pass it along in a Tweet of my own. My intention isn't to "pump", so I apologize for that. I will stick to the due diligence and news.
4107 2018-01-05 23:41:36 $ROKU Be careful not to be too anxious in wanting an entry.  Don't worry about winning THIS stock, trade to win. Other great stocks to trade

4112 2018-01-05 23:39:52 Ponzi? Public stocls represent ownership in cos. that mgmt, (foremost experts on said cos.) deem not valuable enough to keep in house - thus sell off to others. Stocks have no utility, like certain tokens, & certain companies (like us) horde their tokens due to perceived value.

President Trump is true leader: Jobs, Economy/stocks up so r libs crazy or stupid?

4118 2018-01-05 23:33:39 Many traditional analysts dismiss token sales as Ponzis, saying you get no intrinsic value in purchasing a token unlike a stock. Broad statements like that are bound to be wrong re: Utility. BTC has intrinsic value through its decentralized network/security. Public stocks ~Ponzi

4120 2018-01-05 23:32:56 Well noted.  I should have specified that I was referring to discretionary stocks trades I make outside of volatility trading (lower margin requirements).  Our $VIX Strategies only go long Vol ETPs (both short vol and long vol).
4121 2018-01-05 23:32:34 So how will the fire affect the stocks?
4122 2018-01-05 23:31:47 Did you hold a town hall while you're in Ft Collins?

What have you done to help law enforcement? Oh ... yeah... NOTHING

 You did nothing when Trump rolled back the block of the mentally ill getting guns. Bump stocks ... you've done nothing.

Shows who you work for ...
4123 2018-01-05 23:31:22 I don't disagree, but the people who owned 20 stocks in the 90s won't suddenly start running mean-variance optimizations with ETFs.  And if vol spikes, premia go back to where they were.  VIX was < 10 back in '07 too.
4124 2018-01-05 23:30:34 None of this will matter if stocks crash by the time people sell. What are you doing to ensure continued growth? 
Trade agreements? 
More workers? 
Healthier workers?

4126 2018-01-05 23:29:07 That was my exactly. Republicans, FOXnews, Breitbart are all boasting about the stock market rising numbers, but yet they fail to understand that most of middle America does not own stocks!. This tax scam is useless  to the middle class and the poor and it will continue to

4129 2018-01-05 23:27:32 Not many people in stocks. They need to see results in their salaries instead of in their CEO salary.
4130 2018-01-05 23:27:05 Who got somebody that can point me into showing me how to invest in stocks?
4131 2018-01-05 23:26:06 You cannot base improvement on only the rich getting richer....you MUST look at the entire picture, including those who work full time and yet cannot afford decent housing or adequate food, let alone any stocks or bonds. ASSHOLE!
4132 2018-01-05 23:25:29 Dodard!  Stocks don't go straight up.  If you claim credit for the rise, you'll be responsible for the crash - that's coming
4133 2018-01-05 23:25:21 The Obama administration had a handle on how the economy works. Trump has been riding the wave of their actions for months. Looks like that is diminishing.
   His deregulation has caused stocks to grow in value. That has little significant impact on vast majory of U.S.
4134 2018-01-05 23:24:45 #XRP bouncing back after announcing 3 out of 5 of the biggest financial transfer companies will be using #Ripple in 2018.  @WesternUnion stocks also up on the unconfirmed statement.

4135 2018-01-05 23:23:59 Of course you will take the credit.
But when the stocks crash, who will you give that credit too?
Crooked Hillary?
Sloppy Steve?
4136 2018-01-05 23:23:58 @giovfranchi The skeptics point is the future. Only thing that the skeptics agree with @BTC optimists about is that the future is actually unknown. I know that you have now been running on full throttle for 13 years building your own company, allocating capital surplus to stocks.

As my son said, maybe people should just put their lottery ticket money into stocks instead?
4143 2018-01-05 23:21:08 Power producers’ gas consumption has been declining since October 2016 while coal consumption has been rising.   coal stocks inventories back down to 157 million tons by the end of January & 30 million tons below a year earlier. U.S. coal exports jumped in the 4th quarter.

4145 2018-01-05 23:19:52 Weird how the @intel CEO learned of the vulnerability, sold off $39 million in stocks before releasing the information to the general public, and ISN'T going to jail for insider trading.  Must be nice to be rich and above the law
4146 2018-01-05 23:18:56 LOL, It will never happen.  Look at stocks, look at employment and finally look at the real Capital dollars starting to flow back into this country.  You’re Clueless and please keep thinking you’re going to win.  Your heads will Explode!!
4147 2018-01-05 23:18:26 The Federal Reserve isn't pumping stocks every single morning on Twitter before the market opens. Trump is.

4151 2018-01-05 23:16:49 Has everyone forgotten what happened 10 short years ago? Stocks were rising, home sales were incredible..America was great again......then the fake bottom fell out, millions lost their savings. Be ready.
4152 2018-01-05 23:16:20 How many stocks do I have to buy to get hired? Asking for a friend
4153 2018-01-05 23:16:17 JetBlue is a domestic airline and it protected from foreign competitors by the US government by that definition. Higher wages are always a benefit; not as many workers are invested in stocks as you might think. It's still stupid fiscal policy however you slice it.
4154 2018-01-05 23:15:58 @kurteichenwald hey just here to remind you on behalf of @MarkDice that the stock market just hit a all time high and you're a idiot for selling stocks when you did lol

4157 2018-01-05 23:15:05 You know that the Stocks narrative is a Russian psyop to distract from the Michael Wolff situation, right?
4158 2018-01-05 23:14:48 Today been the worst day for stocks i ever seen trump need to do somethint asap 
4159 2018-01-05 23:12:54 Just realized that "stocks and bonds" can refer to money investment stuff, but also horny restraints, and I don't know what to do with this information.
4160 2018-01-05 23:11:45 I know people who don’t own stocks simply because they don’t understand the most elementary concepts of investing. I have no sympathy for not doing basic research to help yourself out.
4161 2018-01-05 23:11:27 They need dividend stocks.
4162 2018-01-05 23:10:43 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
4163 2018-01-05 23:10:30 I can't believe you sold all your kids education stocks because you hate Trump. You do realize stocks are up? WAY up. And climbing. Records all around. You should start a weekly cry at the sky campaign for weak kneed liberals.

4165 2018-01-05 23:09:21 It makes sense that the people with the most money to invest own the most stocks. Also 'the wealthiest' ten percent is constantly in flux. It's not like there's some static top ten percent, people's incomes move up and down throughout their lives.
4166 2018-01-05 23:09:08 You have nothing to do with the economy...stocks rise and fall who ever the president is
4167 2018-01-05 23:08:48 Cryptocurrencies are the future. The dollar is dying. Stocks and bonds will be replaced by tokens. The blockchain is revolutionary.
4168 2018-01-05 23:08:29 Started the week up 15% with weed stocks and some old faithfuls. 13% drop on Wednesday. A whirlwind of buys/sells, all “safe” stocks gone./1

4173 2018-01-05 23:06:05 Okay the rich own 84% of stocks. 16% of the stock market is worth $2,960,000,000. "Poor" people have 2.96 trillion dollars worth of equity. Thats not a small number
4174 2018-01-05 23:05:58 Anyone else notice that over last 6mos or so broker rating changes (even small shops) are moving stocks much more than usual? $ABAX +10% on northcoast upgrade tday?
4175 2018-01-05 23:05:18 Private Prison Stocks...(Invest now)
4176 2018-01-05 23:05:14 It's not inflated at mere will. And you know that because inflation volatility is tiny. Everyone wants their money to inflate. They want that, because that's what causes you to invest. If money didn't inflate, you'd not buy stocks, and youd not grow the us economy.
4177 2018-01-05 23:04:40 We need to Spread the Wealth to All Americans nothing just The Entitled, stocks mean nothing to most People who are barely getting by. Stop tooting your own horn and get something positive done, Not that ridiculous Tax reform either.

4183 2018-01-05 23:02:29 Please CNN let me know a week before Trump is kicked out of office so I have time to sell my stocks I’m 45% ahead since last January
4184 2018-01-05 23:02:26 Yes that's Finally a FACT the stock market is up,.  YET the average person doesn't have million's of dollars in Stocks therefore it's only making you your family and friends Richer making YET again a larger Gap between the Wealthiest and Poorest Americans.

4199 2018-01-05 22:54:48 @chelseahandler after 911 and when our economy crashed stocks were at a all time low. The stock market reflects America’s economy growing. It doesn’t have to do with the rich getting richer. It means America is spending and flourishing. @realDonaldTrump jobs are up

4202 2018-01-05 22:53:12 Remember when both the NRA and congressional republicans said, "yea we should ban bump stocks" and everyone was like "good for them." 

.....and then we did nothing and just moved on
4203 2018-01-05 22:51:38 Well I’m just saying the first trading week of 2018 was pretty uneventful. Hopefully things will start turning up here in the next few weeks. I think $BTC stocks are gonna have a big resurgence in coming weeks as long as #bitcoin #btc continues to uptrend which I’m counting on!
4204 2018-01-05 22:51:35 Jeff Sessions has acted irresponsibly in reversing Obama-era hands off policy w/respect to marijuana.

4213 2018-01-05 22:48:21 CEOs say they will not spend the tax cut on hiring more employees or raising average salaries, but put the tax cut back into buying up their own stocks, raising the prices further & giving investors dividends. Then the rich sell their many shares at a profit, screwing small inve.
4214 2018-01-05 22:48:04 If @realDonaldTrump is so out of it he still beat HRC so the argument is mute @POTUS is the man!

4216 2018-01-05 22:47:00 The market today is fueled by greed and is in a meltup.  Stocks are overpriced and profits have flatlined since 2014.  Look for a major correction as the Fed hikes interest rates and the Mueller investigation heats up.

4223 2018-01-05 22:44:31 So these are the ones behind the US Stocks going up. It’s a COBOL Of incestuous Billionaire feeding.
4224 2018-01-05 22:43:44 And dreadful year? Stocks up, unemployment up, GDP going to break a record. The Libs are the only ones who made it miserable. They don't like a POTUS who fights back

4233 2018-01-05 22:39:16 50% of this nation own stocks. Most in 401k plans that were the replacement for company pensions and one of the early screw jobs to fill Wall Street with the savings of the nation's workers. The GOP thanks you but there will be no bail for middle class.

4237 2018-01-05 22:36:30 There are people who can predict the market, unfortunately they are the same ones than can move stocks, laws and politicians, and they have zero incentive to tell the public how they intend on manipulating price

4254 2018-01-05 22:31:35 au fait, tu aurais une idée du pourquoi cette "version Amazon" est moins chère que la "version normale" ? Un deal exprès entre Logi et Amazon sur certaines séries pour vider des stocks ?
4255 2018-01-05 22:30:09 Last year was the first since 2012 that international stocks outperformed domestic markets. Also, despite risky conditions, US stocks rode the momentum from the previous year to strong gains.

4272 2018-01-05 22:22:13 Who shorted the pot stocks the day before and the day of Jeff Sessions announcement that he would not recognize Obama's pot policy?  The result would have been obvious.  What wasn't obvious was how fast the market would bounce back!!!

4275 2018-01-05 22:21:10 I consider middle class to be in the 50 - 100K a year range. Yes, most of those people have money in stocks. Also, you cant group people based on income. Same income level does not equal same intelligence level.
4276 2018-01-05 22:20:33 What a hell of a first week in 2018 for stocks. Hopefully it’s a sign of things to come for the year!
4277 2018-01-05 22:20:27 big money too be made here me thinks
4278 2018-01-05 22:19:39 You clearly have no idea how stocks work do you? Guessing you don't have any either
4279 2018-01-05 22:19:09 the lightstick is currently sold out everywhere, I was holding a GO for Europe but had to cancel it because of the stocks ...
4280 2018-01-05 22:18:50 Yes BTC is a bubble but his predictions re: the S&P being overvalued at ES 1000 were way off. Now he is saying stocks are in their final leg up, as of two days ago. The real question is when will the Bitcoin bubble pop, and I think he is too early in his assessment.
4281 2018-01-05 22:18:45 People claim Obama’s started the surge, when the country is bankrupt after 2006 the only way is up!!! 

Jobs are difficult to create when statistically more people in America are already in work than almost ever before. 

Stocks 2,100 late 2015, below 1,900 start 2016 now 2,723
4282 2018-01-05 22:16:54 Twitter's main function at this point is to keep losing money to help offset the gains from my not-crappy stocks.
4283 2018-01-05 22:16:52 The stock market is booming because the rich are being taken care of. That doesn't benefit you unless you own stocks.
4284 2018-01-05 22:16:43 If trump supposedly is crazy according 2 MSM, we should only allow crazy people 2 run 4 Office. #MAGA, unemployment, jobs, stocks, etc
4285 2018-01-05 22:16:40 Only 20% of Americans own stocks the golden handshake that trump gave the corporations & billionaire of hopefully can you throw the middle class a bone. Something is better than nothing...

4287 2018-01-05 22:16:27 That's true with all wealth, however.  But it's absurd to suggest stocks went up only for the rich. BTW, they went up for you too.

4289 2018-01-05 22:15:37 Programs are already installed to shut the banks dow to zero.
Restistance Movement and Light Forces took millions from Rothschild for testing the program. Also Wallstreet will go down to zero. Buy back stocks themselves, if not bankruptcy,

4291 2018-01-05 22:14:49 Correct. You'd expect him to say something like "It is very funny that this new American President, this Donald Trump, is constantly bragging about how well the US stocks are doing when his country is built on the backs of the oppressed." or some crap like that.
4292 2018-01-05 22:14:45 You do know Donald like the silver spoon trust fund kid he is inherited a booming economy from Obama right? These high value stocks are just speculators at the trough waiting for the eventual stock buybacks and dividends disbursements thanks to the #GOPTaxBillScam #TaxScam
4293 2018-01-05 22:13:35 Are those figures accurate?  There sure are a lot of people out there with 401k accounts. Those are mutual funds which are multiple stocks.

4296 2018-01-05 22:11:37 It doesn't seem to matter, as the Fed (Powell) has admitted (or it slipped out) to shorting volatility, so it's doing all it can to lift stocks, using unconventional means
4297 2018-01-05 22:10:50 For all you who invested into marijuana stocks or Crypto currency do you think you just got burnt?
4298 2018-01-05 22:10:50 Fact less than 50% own stocks.  National aver. Job 31 hrs work week. Since Trump job creation down an aver. 30k a month.
4299 2018-01-05 22:10:16 Couldn't agree more - it's a cynical attempt to bolster conservative stocks in an election year. Journalism at its worst.
4300 2018-01-05 22:10:06 I need more detail on the stock purchase.  Was it a general market transaction?  If so, was it an agency or principal trade.  If not general market, how did they acquire (many different venues to buy stock). I agree stocks/deficit different animals, I stand behind what ive said

4302 2018-01-05 22:09:05 I’m trying to get some shit together over here and surprise him with his own coins. Always been interested, I’m just naturally wary of everything. I don’t even like adding to the fruitful stocks we have, I’m not a huge gambler, but I like the theory and getting off the dollar.
4303 2018-01-05 22:08:56 Stocks are up while wages remain flat.  Wages up 2.5% compared to historical norm of 3.5%.  So the rich got richer on the backs of low income and middle class.  Only 25% of Americans have stock in 401k savings.  The bump from the one time chump change Corp bonus $ will fizzle 
4304 2018-01-05 22:08:53 So many people have 401k, IRAs, TIAA creff, etc.  Yet you claim ONLY the very rich are investors.   Ever hear of Penny Stocks?
4305 2018-01-05 22:08:52 Stocks close higher amid weak jobs.
4306 2018-01-05 22:08:30 $XLK tech stocks outperform overall market, and $XLB basic material is the strongest sector of the year.  $XLY catch up run still going on.
4307 2018-01-05 22:08:17 Most people don't even realize that they own stocks, or are invested in the market, but if they have a pension or other retirement fund, they are...  and right now they are absolutely KILLING IT under Trump!

4310 2018-01-05 22:07:41 Why don’t you report that the national average job is 31 hrs. a week. And less than 50% of Americans don’t own stocks. So we are still F—k

4313 2018-01-05 22:07:23 People put money in stocks based not on economic history, but rather expectations of future gain. In the year following the 2016 election, the #DJIA increased 26.2%. How did it do under Obama? 9.5%. Liars use the inauguration day, even though that's blatantly misleading.

4315 2018-01-05 22:06:49 Stocks & investments definitely have changed my financial outlook. I know quite a few regular Joe’s who have been able to leave a lot for their families with some strategic investing. You don’t have to be rich to invest. You start where you are.
4316 2018-01-05 22:06:44 Just for my Friday amusement at the answer, Mark, would you call the 10 trillion in negative yielding debt a "bubble"? 
Why or why not? Ps:  I don't see stocks as a "bubble".
4317 2018-01-05 22:06:27 Yes, the rich get richer. This doesn't help the 50% of the country who do not own stocks. What about them?
4318 2018-01-05 22:06:20 Would you continue to put 3k a month into stocks and lose it in hopes that one day you make a profit? No you would be bankrupt before the profiting would ever come
4319 2018-01-05 22:06:12 Here's one example...  EVERY SINGLE TEACHER AND PROFESSOR in this country!!  In fact, every person in this country who has a pension or 401K has benefited from the market BOOMunder Trump. Market growth doesn't just benefit wealthy.  It benefits anyone holding stocks!
4320 2018-01-05 22:05:44 The difference is the well documented phenomenon of part time and temporary jobs vs long term high paying jobs with good benefits. Like the 401k stocks that are going up and up.
4321 2018-01-05 22:04:30 Ini, it has nothing to do with APC or PDP nor old stocks It's Nigerians factor which is the issue. Brings in aliens into Nigeria it be will same thing except Nigerians change their altitudes., otherwise nothing will change.

I have the vitamin stocks. A lot. If no one buy it, they won't hire me again..
4356 2018-01-05 21:52:59 Brother not trying to rain on your parade but if you want to follow candlesticks but those rules don't apply in this file tool Market in crypto you want to read candlestick read them on the on the S&P $500 or stocks on the NASDAQ order books are really the true window
4357 2018-01-05 21:52:51 The stocks for the goal scorer
4358 2018-01-05 21:52:50 The forgotten men and women do not have stocks..you cannot take credit for the stock market. You could take care of those you said you would...people working real jobs without a fortune who needed a hand up! Trickle down, no affordable healthcare does nothing for them!
4359 2018-01-05 21:52:45 Market Close: MBS -9bps; DOW +220.74; NASDAQ +58.64; S&P 500 +19.16; 10yr Treasury 2.47%; Optimism spikes stocks.  Disappointing headline number for Jobs, but positive components.  MBS continues to drop (rates go up).
4360 2018-01-05 21:52:36 What made you hold your $MMJ over the other pot stocks you took profit on? I'm a holder as well
4361 2018-01-05 21:52:33 Are they trying to completely kill consumer confidence so they can buy back all their stocks dirt cheap before putting out Jobs' last great invention?
4362 2018-01-05 21:52:27 How did you manage to get a paintbrush so quickly? I’m still trying to figure out how to make money apart from freebies/games/stocks. o:
4363 2018-01-05 21:52:12 My business teacher just compared buying back stocks to a cocaine habit. “Neither are sustainable long term”
4364 2018-01-05 21:51:19 The top five stocks that fell today were $RRC, $JCI, $SCG, and $ULTA.
4365 2018-01-05 21:51:12 Penny stocks 
4366 2018-01-05 21:51:05 Dow stock index hit 12,000 under Clinton, 14,000 under Geo W Bush, 18,000 under Obama, 25,000 high so far under Trump in one year. I'm tired of Gasparino & Democrats claiming stocks went higher under Obama-as if he weren't part of 2007-2011 Democrat majority Congress during crash
4367 2018-01-05 21:50:56 You don't make money when the stock price goes up.

You make money by selling your stock before the price goes down.

99% of us are always left holding a bag of worthless stocks once the price goes down.  Trump and his buddies will get a heads up before this house of cards falls.

4371 2018-01-05 21:49:25 It’s more so about being able to get in and out of stocks now and ALWAYS be able to get into something if it has that look of a “10-20 plays a year get u rich” play.
4372 2018-01-05 21:49:05 Awesome idea. We feel silly for not doing this sooner. We'll check on PCB stocks and get it into the next boards!

The justice department shouldn't decide what laws to enforce or not enforce that's up to Congress. Buying marijuana stocks has its risk.
4379 2018-01-05 21:46:55 Sir, advice some stocks to study also.... nano/small or mid cap. thanks for timely advice.
4380 2018-01-05 21:46:36 We will only be offering a print version of the book as of right now. If you cannot preorder it we will have limited stocks for purchase at future cons and in our store envy store later. You will just not be getting the full bundle with it.
4381 2018-01-05 21:46:28 The market has ALWAYS been forward looking.  People HAVE NEVER bought stocks based on last year, they are speculating on next year, ALWAYS forward looking.
4382 2018-01-05 21:45:28 Stop crying big baby...they reported it.  Why shouldn’t stocks be up..companies are getting everything on the backs of middle class.

4391 2018-01-05 21:42:20 Nice close from $VPRB back over .10. In this MJ sector pullback notice which stocks recover quickly and continue vs which sink further. VPRB is a profitable company with no dilution or debt in the vape/ecig industry, insulated from US MJ concerns. 30M float and $1 a year ago...
4392 2018-01-05 21:41:43 The stock market helps all those that have stocks currently. .your 401K has been effected positively. .get an advisor..they do not charge unless you trade stocks

Everytime Twitter kept cutting me off during Tweets took me out and ask to confirm that I am a human, I do so. Even Twitter and Facebook are protecting Trump because their Stocks went up. Dont let

4406 2018-01-05 21:37:01 But the DOW...oh yeah most people do not have stocks nor can afford them.
4407 2018-01-05 21:36:51 Good to see all stocks
4408 2018-01-05 21:36:24 Unusual options activity allows you to find stocks before hedge funds do.
4409 2018-01-05 21:35:12 There’s so much more attached to a bull market than just stocks. But, regardless, would you like it better if the market was down?
4410 2018-01-05 21:35:08 Wrong! CNN Money reported “If Donald Trump wins the election, U.S. stocks (and likely many other markets overseas) will almost certainly tank.” Based on CNN’s own comments from a year ago, 150% of the rally Credit goes to Trump.
4411 2018-01-05 21:34:44 @CNBCJou Hope u have as good a time tonight on your Birthday as may stocks did celebrating your birthday today ! Your B-Day good omen for the #Dow #NASDAQ . I'll have 1 glass of something very good to celebrate my huge $ making day cause of your B-day. Good luck market 
4412 2018-01-05 21:34:37 I wanna invest in stocks this year
4413 2018-01-05 21:33:37 Two ex-Googlers have a replacement for your local big-box store: a parcel locker that only stocks one product per day.
4414 2018-01-05 21:33:11 Agreed. It's difficult to properly value anything that does not have a cash flow and Bitcoin, Tesla, and Canadian pot stocks are all in that situation right now (although, I am enjoying my returns from Aphria :)
4415 2018-01-05 21:31:25 My dad lost half his stocks value under W, made it all back and much more by 2012, all blue chip & utilities.

4423 2018-01-05 21:28:55 That is not historically helpful to stocks ... but maybe this time id different. Utilities down today
4424 2018-01-05 21:28:49 not only is his tweet not true, even if it were the stocks are parts of companies that people buy goods and services from... People fighting the tax cuts are the ones hurting the economy.

4427 2018-01-05 21:27:56 Also, while many people who aren't rich don't own stocks, they may very well have 401(k) or other retirement accounts that are loaded with stocks. So STFU.
4428 2018-01-05 21:27:26 The wife sure puts you on a pedestal! Many a short sella have gone long stocks and been very wrong. Don't let Greed or emotion blind your vision. Great trade, so far!
4429 2018-01-05 21:27:15 actually most scanners don't cover low priced stocks, so you wanna cheap out, it'll cost you FAR more in the long run...anti-education/anti-tool people are so dumb, it's laughable
4430 2018-01-05 21:26:43 Just watched @CNBC for 5 minutes. Just heard @MCaruso_Cabrera restate myth of retail investors avoiding stocks as "Good for the rally", and trickle-down moron @larry_kudlow state that populism is consistent with Elites getting huge tax breaks. #FakeNewsAwards
4431 2018-01-05 21:26:12 I think the ones from theraplate are a little flimsy, so I made some at home. The college I attend allows me to use their stocks as well!

4433 2018-01-05 21:24:58 Stocks rise when employers cut expenses like payroll 2 increase bottom line. High stock markets only good 4 investors, CEOs

4435 2018-01-05 21:24:31 Great Job but this is for the Corporations and small businesses and people who have STOCKS Jobs are still low ,  no increase in wages and the Economy growth for the Middle Class still low

4438 2018-01-05 21:23:25 So Spotify will be going public by the end of this quarter. It is safe to say you know who will be buying stocks in them 
4439 2018-01-05 21:23:16 no giddiness here. my stocks sucked today
4440 2018-01-05 21:23:03 You realize that most Americans don't own stocks, right? And that we are waiting for those who directly benefit from the stock market to do something with all that money besides shipping it offshore? No? Didn't think so.
4441 2018-01-05 21:22:13 Loooooool I guess he only stocks Pedi soul mates then? 
4442 2018-01-05 21:22:00 @Layza15Layza Ay, and then there was Martin Swart I have heard my grandfather talk of, and of the jolly Almains whom he commanded, with their slashed doublets and quaint hose, all frounced with ribands above the nether-stocks. #FlashbackFriday
4443 2018-01-05 21:21:57 @IncredibleTrade has the best trading community I have been on for stocks, options, and crypto .  Trust me I have tried enough chatrooms and this as my home now.   Thank you for all that you do.  Awesome week1 for 2018.. portfolio 3x already.   Now some Rampur time !!!
4444 2018-01-05 21:21:24 Dow Jones Stocks increase to 25295.87 today ... best year start since 2006.
4445 2018-01-05 21:19:11 I am c85% invested which is v high for me. Current market momentum means we need to make hay. Have started moving more into Divi/defensive....will also liquidate some stocks as the year progresses. Some current PE ratios bonkers IMO....have a plan for when market turns IMO
4446 2018-01-05 21:19:07 Thank you !!! Oh wait, like most people, I don’t have stocks
4447 2018-01-05 21:18:46 "In the first three versions of the Goldilocks story, Goldilocks actually died horribly, and we think that could well happen again [to stocks]."

4450 2018-01-05 21:18:03 Look like you got your wish! %10 on btc!
4451 2018-01-05 21:17:37 That’s why my Raytheon stocks are up
4452 2018-01-05 21:17:23 Think about this. Less jobs today, the stock market at an all time high spells out what? It is the first two legs of the three to crash the market. The other leg, faith and trust in our country and it’s leader. Watch your stocks minute by minute. 2008 looms.
4453 2018-01-05 21:17:17 It gives ya boost man when one runs and you're like yes, i needed that one to make a move. That's why traders is drawn to these otc stocks, its great for everybody brother.
4454 2018-01-05 21:17:15 My point exactly. Banks need to offer a better rate to people who bank with them and have neither the time nor expertise to monitor stocks.
4455 2018-01-05 21:17:01 So this week I decided to get out of some pot stocks with some great profits. Loaded up my majority on some Lithium stocks $AAZ $FAT $SX also threw some at $GET $HIVE. Still holding my $MMJ $LG and $BLGV which should run.
4456 2018-01-05 21:16:51 Not to mention, most Americans don't even have stocks, so I personally don't really care if rich ppl are getting richer
4457 2018-01-05 21:16:37 In Trump's first year, stocks soar for rich, but wages stay flat - Washington Post
4458 2018-01-05 21:16:37 Slowest job growth in 2 years! You loser 60% ppl don’t have stocks! This means nothing to most working Americans!
4459 2018-01-05 21:16:26 Fast Stock Market growth is NOT an indicator of a strong economy.  It took 17 yrs for tech stocks to recover trillions from the dot-com crash (Think Qualcomm)Fast market rise in 2006 dropped 22% in 8 days in 2007 crushing the middle class. Stocks are overvalued now(think Amazon)!
4460 2018-01-05 21:15:28 Cannabis stocks plunged on a report that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is moving to revoke policies that allowed the legalization of marijuana to spread across several U.S. states -- including California, which is now the world’s biggest market for the drug.
4461 2018-01-05 21:15:24 US stocks have advanced to new record highs in each trading session this week. The Trump Rally Extends...
4462 2018-01-05 21:15:01 Half the country do not own or care about stocks. So happy for the major companies and the already rich benefiting from it. Yay!
4463 2018-01-05 21:14:30 Happy days. Except I am middle class and alas I cannot afford stocks. Just trying to make the mortgage.
4464 2018-01-05 21:14:10 Sure. A retail-less market might top out more rationally than in the past. Say what one will, algos and pension fund boards probably more rational actors at the top than my college dorm mates buying proteomics stocks in '00.
4465 2018-01-05 21:14:01 not much concern for stocks.
4466 2018-01-05 21:13:45 everyone banking? hardly. this action is extremely dangerous, i bet almost everyone lost that played "C" stocks
4467 2018-01-05 21:12:48 Fast Stock Market growth is NOT an indicator of a strong economy.  It took 17 yrs for tech stocks to recover trillions from the dot-com crash (Think Qualcomm)The market high in 2006 dropped 22% in 8 days in 2007 crushing the middle class. Stocks are overvalued now(think Amazon)!
4468 2018-01-05 21:12:27 Yes.  But at the human level it is wildly regressive.  Capital holdings and assets (real estate, companies, stocks) grow in value with inflation. Savings, fixed incomes, cash, all devalue wth the dollar.  The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.
4469 2018-01-05 21:12:05 How about the idiot you have on now. When stocks do well, so does your 401k.
4470 2018-01-05 21:11:54 Wow! Trump massive pumped up economy! AMERICA unleashed!

4480 2018-01-05 21:09:37 It's official: With the 1st trading week in the books, Wall St. is officially repricing stocks based on the Tax Reform Law. In general terms, there is no over-priced stocks. But, of course, you can always find a few overly-priced stocks that have to do nothing with tax reform.
4481 2018-01-05 21:09:16 The only way you're fighting for the little guy is for a prospering economy and job growth. We finally have it. Stocks up to record highs. Translates to higher wages and more jobs for the little guy. Someone builds the yachts, you know.
4482 2018-01-05 21:08:46 Tickers DO Move up or down for long time without good entry set up. So 1) you do not chase and 2) do not fight with counter trend trades relentlessly. Regardless of you trading #Futures or #Options or #Stocks
4483 2018-01-05 21:08:11 Stocks  have been climbing for years and you lie if you say otherwise, they are not about you just like the other claims you make.
4484 2018-01-05 21:07:54 Are big cap stocks discounting 1.) A major economic expansion 2.) A major $ deval/HI 
3.) Buybacks galore
4485 2018-01-05 21:07:32 #Stocks wrap up #NewYears week with a record shattering rally. #Dow closes at new high, up 221 to 25,296 #NASDAQ +59 #SP500 +19 to record highs @KNX1070 @CBSLA #MottekOnMoney #HappyNewYear
4486 2018-01-05 21:07:30 @degiroeu Why do some stocks like canopy growth corp have no order book charts or anything but the orders execute just fine?
4487 2018-01-05 21:07:22 Euh il a juste escroqué avec un pistolet sur la tempe  : 500 milliards de $ en Arabie saoudites, une centaine émirats, Qatar, etc ... mais à part ça l’industrie militaire tourne à plein régime pour renouveler tous les stocks, vu l’énorme quantité de bombes périmées larguées...
4488 2018-01-05 21:07:06 What stocks have you spread into CES 2018 Las Vegas?

4490 2018-01-05 21:05:58 Pretty sure EM stocks have just about returned their forecasted 7 year compounded returns YTD
4491 2018-01-05 21:05:02 Starbucks has its problems, but they do give benefits at 20 hrs/week, give long-term employees stocks, and afaik don't steal tips.

4493 2018-01-05 21:04:46 i should of just studied stocks and played music on the side. for example buy low, sell high. instead of play low notes and sometimes some high notes.
4494 2018-01-05 21:04:43 Yes, I have a lad-in-waiting, walking behind me at all times, carrying a sack of cash. I shall insist he stocks up with single notes in future.
4495 2018-01-05 21:04:33 Tax Bill is working for the very rich! Stocks up $25,300!  Of Course, 50% of America does not own stock and 80% of Stock Market wealth goes to the top 10% of investors! Trump and GOP working on cutting Welfare to our most needy!  It is called Plutocracy! Not Democracy!
4496 2018-01-05 21:04:23 What percentage of those gains are from penny stocks (say tickers under .10)?   Thanks.
4497 2018-01-05 21:04:16 Stocks=dont care. My taxes won't be lower, . Economy=obama. Military is abt. Right. Resisting autocracy, oligarchy, racism, cuts 2safetynet.

4500 2018-01-05 21:03:33 Whoever posted about Pot stocks,did you catch how many shares traded on $TRTC? For a market cap of only 300 mil, 60 million shares traded is a lot of shares changing hands.
4501 2018-01-05 21:03:30 Breaking: NYSE, NASDAQ to open on Saturday to allow more time to buy stocks.
4502 2018-01-05 21:03:21 If only that were true. I own LOTS of stocks and am NOWHERE near the top 10%. Come out of your echo chamber now and then.
4503 2018-01-05 21:03:05 80 percent of stocks are owned by 10 percent of the population. Most Americans have nothing in the stock market. People need jobs and better wages. Trump failed to deliver either.
4504 2018-01-05 21:02:57 @markminervini With the recent scandal and share price collapse of Steinhoff. I find it strange why hedge fund managers or assets managers will lend stocks to people who wants to short sell them. I am going to use a scenario based example ...Part 1
4505 2018-01-05 21:02:30 My stocks are close to making $500 since August. Considering I have no idea what I'm investing in/doing, that seems like a good deal. 
4506 2018-01-05 21:02:17 I wish I knew how to trade stocks in college. I would’ve gone all in on Netflix and been able to retire right now

4510 2018-01-05 21:00:44 I'm 24/7 concerned about fish stocks lmao. my family grew up in a fishing village and we are all used to seawater fish _(:'3 I'm part of the problem too but fish...pls survive!!
4511 2018-01-05 21:00:40 No. Pension funds are directly funded from the company (or government) that pays them directly to the retired worker. Now the company could be invested in other stocks/bonds however those investments are not directly related in the payments.
4512 2018-01-05 21:00:37 @DayanaYochim Want to invest in penny stocks  Need to do research  stock prices & study before buying.

4518 2018-01-05 20:59:08 @timseymour Tim what POT stocks do you like ? I picked up some $MJX today.
4519 2018-01-05 20:58:48 You don’t understand the majority of Americans do not own stocks. 45th is still below were it’s supposed to be, wages only went up .08 cent a hour in 2017. No improvements other wise.
4520 2018-01-05 20:58:15 Après ouai dans les fripes connu il y’a killoshop, épisode etc mais faut venir le lundi ou mardi pour avoir les meilleurs trucs, c’est la qu ils font les stocks

4522 2018-01-05 20:57:54 LRT fish stocks are decreasing due to climate change and this dude wasting a fresh fish for views smh!!!
4523 2018-01-05 20:57:36 My dad is gonna call me and ask if he should buy more stocks any day now
4524 2018-01-05 20:57:24 2% a week is better than a 2 year treasury. A little surrealistic. When the blockchain type action moves to  mainstream growth stocks , it will be time to batten down the hatches. This can last longer than we expect.
4525 2018-01-05 20:57:06 Quick. Look over there. The bright shiny thing. The Clintons. Yes the Clintons. Where'd they go? What did they do? Quick. Look over there. Jobsjobsjobs. No matter it's a 6 year low. Jobs! Stocks! Stocks!
Treason? What treason? We are busy.
4526 2018-01-05 20:57:02 Looking ripe for major breakout here!
4527 2018-01-05 20:56:45 Hey, they regulate the lady parts more than guns. If we put bump stocks on the vag, they would be hands off

4531 2018-01-05 20:55:55 My theme for 2018 is Mega Trends. Rare to see weekly RSI>70 in Big stocks. $BHP $WPL $RIO all are now. $XJO $OIL & of course Bitcoin.
4532 2018-01-05 20:55:41 I love the way people talk about wealth redistribution as a bad thing when taking it BACK from the rich. But when a capitalist takes it off workers that's ok or better yet share holders,fact,84% of all American stocks are owned by 1% of the population but that's ok distribution
4533 2018-01-05 20:55:38 Pot stocks, man. This morning I decide to add $MPX.C to my basket of pots in my RRSP for the "long run". Up 32%...eh, sold. :/
4534 2018-01-05 20:55:32 You know Donald, the avaerge person out there, working every day doesn't own any stocks. Can you guess who does? So you little rants about how well the stock markets are doing, doesn't mean a damned thing to the avaerge Joe. Give that some thought,  take your time.
4535 2018-01-05 20:55:16 Sorry jako, par. 212 tr. řádu 2008 řeší Opuštění dítěte, 260 Podpora propagandistického hnutí k potlačování práv a svobod. Kalousek je trochu nepřesný, spíš kecá.

4537 2018-01-05 20:55:01 Used to love weekends when I had a job, start hating them after stocks, started liking them double after Crypto. This is too much!!
4538 2018-01-05 20:54:18 Also known as insider trading. Knowingly selling of stocks because of information that could cause stock loss and loss of monetary gain. Yep, blue collar crimes still exist.
4539 2018-01-05 20:53:56 don't forget the FANG stocks too ! $AMZN $NFLX $GOOG and $FB all new highs
4540 2018-01-05 20:53:40 $CYTX entry .27, big late day move, exit .41. Take the gift, back to cash. #Stocks #Investing

4542 2018-01-05 20:52:42 @karenhunter If we cant get dispensaries we must get in thru the backdoor. Cannabis stocks are very affordable "Now"
4543 2018-01-05 20:52:06 Lmao maybe Intel and AMD should have red teams looking for bugs in each other's chips, use the bugs to short stocks;-)
4544 2018-01-05 20:51:23 people, if you're gonna do sports analogies when talking stocks, know what you're talking about in sports. please.

4546 2018-01-05 20:50:30 "I do say, Harry, how shall we keep the masses from revolting against the very notion of a stock market?"

"I know! Let's tie their entire  retirement into it and do away with pensions! So even if rising stocks don’t indicate good things for them they’ll deal.”

"Brilliant!”

4554 2018-01-05 20:48:43 If one of my microcap stocks comes out with a press release saying they’re adopting some bullshit block chain process, I will sell into the spike immediately. I swear to god. Sign of a low integrity mgmt team.
4555 2018-01-05 20:48:14 Yeah, that's all well and good for your rich buddies. Most Americans don't own stocks. You're actually bragging about making rich Americans rich again.

4557 2018-01-05 20:47:36 Goals for this year:
1. Master Forex
2. Learn how to invest in Stocks
3. Master Cryptos
4558 2018-01-05 20:47:30 @Needmoneyforcarparts I had a day job. Then I started making daily gains in stocks..... Now all I do is what I want...
4559 2018-01-05 20:47:12 So either 1) dividends rise (following tax reform), 2) stocks go lower (inc div yield) or 3) bonds rally (unlikely in a tightening cycle). Which is it Jeff?
4560 2018-01-05 20:47:06 Is this snark? Can anyone be so blissfully unaware that 50% of the people in this country don't earn enough to pay for their basic needs, let alone save anything or buy stocks?
4561 2018-01-05 20:46:45 Country in rising peril....#stocks lifting like a balloon....what gives?
4562 2018-01-05 20:46:44 We apologize that this caused you an inconvenience.  We monitor various stocks for suspicious activity. This is not a reflection on the company but on the vulnerability of possible manipulation of the security. ^CD
4563 2018-01-05 20:46:39 HI. Would you like some free portraits? I'm wanting to do a test run of some portraits with a few different film stocks. They need to be exterior shots so dress warm. But let me know and we can set something up this evening. Or tomorrow.
4564 2018-01-05 20:46:01 It appears there is no end to the drooling, foaming  from the mouth Algo’s in their thirst to pay higher prices for stocks. I’m gonna buy some more smh and qqq puts at the close. “Hail Mary full of grace”.......
4565 2018-01-05 20:45:50 Thanks!  I was reading that 84% of stocks are owned by the richest 10% of Americans, so was having trouble trying to understand where the excitement from the other 90% of us was coming from.  
Not that I agree with you, but I do appreciate your POV :)
4566 2018-01-05 20:45:48 Per New York University economist Edward Wolff, “as of 2013, the top 1% of households by wealth owned nearly 38% of all stock shares.” Top 20% own 92% of stocks. Average Joes don't get a thing from the booming stock market. $1k bonus isn't an hourly wage bump.

4569 2018-01-05 20:45:31 Yeah I need to invest in stocks this year
4570 2018-01-05 20:44:31 Dude I'm not emotionally attached to any of my stocks... I do my dd and invest... if you make such statements back it up instead of hiding behind your mommas apron...
4571 2018-01-05 20:44:06 Sure, I’d buy an annuity, or bond, or group of dividend paying stocks (depending on your terms for the loan) that yielded more than 3.33%, pay you regularly, pocket the monthly difference and at the end of the 30 years I’d have either a million bucks or a pretty nice income
4572 2018-01-05 20:43:53 The stocks are up all over the world.  I guess he did that too.  Little Tricky Dick Donald has got to go!
4573 2018-01-05 20:42:19 I just started buying stocks in July of last year and I'm 63 yrs old, worked all my life and have a little now to try stocks. I've made a few thousand dollars listening to Jim, studying at night, getting on the internet. It's risky, know that going in but can pay off.
4574 2018-01-05 20:42:00 Almost every peer I'm talking to is investing in cryptos not one is interested in stocks. They want the fast money. Not sure if I'm a mug for investing in equities!
4575 2018-01-05 20:41:34 @FoxBusiness @realDonaldTrump Sears and Kmart have be declining for years. This is no surprise that they are on their last leg. Jobs..Economy..Stocks soaring. Thanks to Donald J. Trump.
4576 2018-01-05 20:41:14 Most of that salary was in oil stocks and bonus money.
4577 2018-01-05 20:41:13 Did you miss his tweet from a couple weeks ago where he claimed he had gone on all in on euro stocks b/c he's smrat?
4578 2018-01-05 20:40:47 Another interesting fact we read about Buffet once - When he buys any stock, he is likely to make money on it because once people hear about the stocks he's buying, they go and do the same, thus increasing the price of the stocks he purchased. Supply & Demand!
4579 2018-01-05 20:39:55 We all love a bad boy don't we

4582 2018-01-05 20:39:18 Does Apple sell their products in US? Doesn’t Apple have their HQ in Cali? Doesn’t surplus in cash lead to more R&D? 
Remember, international companies are still affected by the US and it’s stocks...
Why does assembly in China change the fact that they are improving product?
4583 2018-01-05 20:39:02 Learning about stocks hurts my brain
4584 2018-01-05 20:38:51 @TheCrowsNest0069 @AmazonPharmaceutical maybe.. maybe not. If markets cooled off high debt, momo stocks get hit the hardest. But okay
4585 2018-01-05 20:38:39 Sure buddy, Chinese feed you and you are hungry a half hour later same with stocks they want our money and have it !
4586 2018-01-05 20:38:30 It would...especially banking stocks....that's if you have capital 
4587 2018-01-05 20:38:20 Wall Street loves the jobs report. Stocks surging. I'll be talking about the markets and jobs numbers with @Pat_Gillespie and @richardquest on @cnni at 4:01 ET.
4588 2018-01-05 20:37:56 Another answer to your question is. When you look at charts also look for patterns many stocks have repeated patterns over and over..
Please pm if you need i will try answer whst i can
4589 2018-01-05 20:37:39 Who gives a flying crap about the stupid stock market...but the rich of course as the poor people and middle class don't see any of that.  Who the hell can afford stocks??????  Oh....the Rich of course.  Line your pockets.

4593 2018-01-05 20:35:56 I cleaned my car and my room
I bought some stocks
Today has been a great day
4594 2018-01-05 20:35:48 Haha. But most of your coal miner voters don’t have stocks. Do they?!
4595 2018-01-05 20:35:44 Trading stocks is so similar to playing poker!  Fundamentals are the same....I still have a lot to learn but I’m getting there. Found my first #gapfill today!
4596 2018-01-05 20:35:36 At times, with certain stocks,  we need to monitor trading patterns to protect our client's interests. This is to ensure the integrity of the market place. ^CD
4597 2018-01-05 20:35:15 Weed stocks yesterday (and today) and China stocks today...

Is it Monday yet..?
4598 2018-01-05 20:35:09 The Dow is now up nearly 200 points. Reminder. The Dow is a price-weighted average of just 30 stocks. And the stock with the highest price, Boeing, is leading the charge today. $BA up 3.7% to above $300.
4599 2018-01-05 20:35:07 Market Extra: Bullish sentiment for U.S. stocks is at a seven-year high
4600 2018-01-05 20:34:37 Remember, we're not day traders or insiders in the purest sense of the term. One must know a little something or have a TRUSTWORTHY financial adverser to invest wisely. We can't sit and watch stocks.
4601 2018-01-05 20:33:39 Rising stocks do not necessarily reflect the health of a company, particularly if it is part of a bubble industry.
4602 2018-01-05 20:33:32 Wall Street Instant Update; Stocks rally in record high territory into the home stretch, DJI 25,252 up 177, Nasdaq +45, S&P up 15; Oil closes down .9% at $61.44/bbl; Gold up .1% at $1320.30 oz.,
4603 2018-01-05 20:32:57 More than 1/2 of Americans don’t own stocks you buffoon. Rich getting richer does not equal approval or success.
4604 2018-01-05 20:32:46 "But most Americans don't own stocks!! The market going up only benefits the rich!"

In this day and age, it has never been easier, or CHEAPER to invest. If you're tight on cash, invest $10 a month into a vanguard index fund. It takes time to build wealth.
4605 2018-01-05 20:32:26 Yes but YOU said that when Trump elected stocks would tank??  What happened? Go do something else obviously you know nothing about the stack market. You liberal lens has washed away any credibility you might have had!
4606 2018-01-05 20:31:52 Bitcoin is not going nowhere, the banks are treating it like a pennystock yet i bet the banks themselves are trading them personally... (Biggots) Surprised they probably against marijuana but then again trading the stocks that been recently jumping lol #politics #CheddarLIVE
4607 2018-01-05 20:31:36 Suspended sentence, surely? Sometimes I do believe we ought to bring back stocks so that we can all literally throw stuff at these *rseholes.
4608 2018-01-05 20:31:34 What did the Donald Trump Casino stocks do in this period?
Lmfao.  let me give you a hint BK
4609 2018-01-05 20:31:17 Apparently you do not own stocks or have a retirement account! Or you would understand the value!
4610 2018-01-05 20:31:00 If you want stocks to up an be more valuable jump start the American Industrial with the government help!we spend more than 50billion buying product over seas!this need to be cut down to 10 billion or less!
4611 2018-01-05 20:30:34 The stock market has been reaching new highs for the last 4 to 6 years.  Nothing new.  How does this help the average American?  Not to mention a large portion of stocks are owned by foreigners in other countries.

4619 2018-01-05 20:28:15 Ah sorry, I misunderstood you. Yeah they also haven’t all information for my stocks too. But for now I am fine with the price. I have to add the dividends manually which is okay I guess. Hope they will continue to build and extend this platform!

4625 2018-01-05 20:27:08 Only helps 10% but 50% don't own stocks so 50% do own them and benefit from the increase.  Do the math.

4633 2018-01-05 20:25:24 The ironic thing is, Potash is used in the hydroponics industry as a mineral to boost plant growth (particularly flowering). So, in a way, buy Pot stocks?  @jimcramer Searles perhaps?

4638 2018-01-05 20:23:17 One of my best friends is a veteran who has a lot of health problems from Iraq. He has a shoebox of pills. 

With MJ, he can quit taking half of them, but it’s not legal where he lives. So every 6 months he drives to CO, stocks up and drives back. 

It’s madness.
4639 2018-01-05 20:23:10 Not fully correct.  Many of us have 401Ks since pension plans were done away with and many of those are invested in stocks, so indirectly many of us are in stocks. I am glad the market us doing so well, but also realize it is due to the programs implemented by Obama.

4651 2018-01-05 20:19:47 From your article:

"Stocks have risen in nine of the first ten months of the Trump Administration, a record that no other U.S. president can match."
4652 2018-01-05 20:19:45 I kept telling my Financial Advisor to move more of my assets to low risk, and he told me a few months ago "You know, you don't own any US stocks". Just saying.

4660 2018-01-05 20:15:35 Bunch of Trump nonsense - media reports on stock market surge every day. Fact that many Americans don't own stocks could be why they don't care much. Like tax cuts, this is more exciting for wealthy & corporations than middle class.
4661 2018-01-05 20:15:25 There is ZERO reason the markets will fall in early 2018. Tax reform will help small cap stocks the most and the S&P overall due to repatriation and stock buybacks. Deregulation will continue to help financials, especially regional banks.

4684 2018-01-05 20:08:09 You're such an ass. You don't even see that the stock market is soaring because the top 1% is buying stock, not the average American who cannot afford to invest in stocks.
4685 2018-01-05 20:07:53 Big whoop. It only helps the few who have stocks and want tp sell.

4688 2018-01-05 20:07:12 The DOW is price-weighted (not market cap weighted) and only includes 30 stocks. Boeing has an oversized influence on the DOW because of its high numerical stock price. Boeing's growth in the last year affects market cap of the total US stock market by <1%.

4692 2018-01-05 20:05:25 I'm skeptical -- I think $SQ climaxed back in November, which usually leads to a long consolidation. $MU, I dunno, could get going and I hope it does, but looks later stage to me. Not bearish on either, but sort of favoring stocks that are earlier in their uptrends at this point.
4693 2018-01-05 20:05:17 ...is a ponzi scheme.  If 100% of the investors cashed in 100% of all the stocks, not only would the stock market go broke but bankrupted deep deep in the hole, because that amount of money does not exist in the system.
4694 2018-01-05 20:05:16 No, I'll give Trump credit for this. His removing regulations caused this. However it is high all because of speculation and corporations buying back their own stocks. The problem is there is no capital backing it. Once that becomes clear, it will massively tank.
4695 2018-01-05 20:05:09 Probably not. I have had this happen plenty in my life, especially on thinner stocks.

4736 2018-01-05 19:52:25 Will this poor family ever get peace ,this scum getting money spent on him ,let public know who and where he is then bring back the stocks and put him in em! !!
4737 2018-01-05 19:52:00 Fantastic breakout in Netflix $NFLX  #37 overall out of 5,500 rank in Best Stocks Now App. I remain long.
4738 2018-01-05 19:51:49 The scary (in a good way) thing is many stocks just in early innings of trend moves out of long sideways ranges...too many set-ups to keep track of...
4739 2018-01-05 19:51:31 How can I invest in weed Stocks?
4740 2018-01-05 19:51:20 I can't thank you enough for the HUGE jump in all my investments! My Dad, began teaching me about the stock market when I was in Junior high school. We talked every day about our stocks, until he passed away. I thank him and you!
4741 2018-01-05 19:51:03 If you are participating in breaks as a means to flip and make money - then go to the casino or as you said above invest in stocks. What I can share is 1)spend what you can afford 2) join breaks for sharing the hobby love and meeting good folks the cards are perks. 
4742 2018-01-05 19:50:14 Great read from @PICSCanada  : How different types of trees can boost #carbon stocks in BC’s forests.
4743 2018-01-05 19:50:10 Big Pharma doesn't give a shit The weed game has zero affect on the opiate game They have their fingers in a lot of pies Believe me Big Pharma will be growing bud tooThis maybe a ploy to keep marijuana stocks low So his scumbag buddies can get in The weed revolution will not stop
4744 2018-01-05 19:49:37 @jimcramer do you guys on cnbc ever say anything negative on market you all push your own stocks to the hill including nvda
4745 2018-01-05 19:49:08 This summer I'm definitely investing in some stocks just don't know which ones 
4746 2018-01-05 19:48:43 My stocks have not moved. Pay off my school loans.
4747 2018-01-05 19:48:08 Everyone has a chance to buy stocks.  Everyone!!!
4748 2018-01-05 19:47:55 The Dowindicates that investors, i.e you & other greed gluttons, watch your investments grow. Corporations’ stocks are turning profit, likely by slashing jobs & benefits, outsourcing & violating environmental laws.  How many Americans remain at or under the poverty line?
4749 2018-01-05 19:47:49 @neillwine Quick question do you or do you know who stocks @THtonics in NI? Looking to buy their cherry blossom tonic.
4750 2018-01-05 19:47:45 Sheree: “it was not stocks. It was securities fraud.” Lol. Like that is different. Stocks = securities. #RHOA
4751 2018-01-05 19:47:08 @ShepNewsTeam God I hate  u!You constantly are bashing trump and doing stories to hurt him. He's made you a lot of $ from ur stocks.#loser
4752 2018-01-05 19:46:34 So, in other words, true investing should be as exciting as watching the grass grow or the paint dry. I've owned quite a number stocks for over 25 years. Buy and hold can work, and more often than not, does.
4753 2018-01-05 19:45:54 Thank you brother! Trying to do my best, same way of trading, just with more shares

4755 2018-01-05 19:45:08 I like him a lot as a writer and podcaster, but the whole ‘I’ll teach you to invest in crypto’ (and stocks) just doesn’t sit well with me. Especially because he promotes smaller coins, which he has the $ to influence. 
4756 2018-01-05 19:44:43 Maybe he thinks stocks trickle down too just like dollars? STILL waiting for my trickle, any trickle!
4757 2018-01-05 19:44:10 I need to start investing my money on stocks
4758 2018-01-05 19:43:02 @CNN @BBC Donnie, you will ultimately cost us in lives lost and several trillion dollars by promoting wars in the Middle East and Korean.   Many people do not benefit from a record Dow?   Who cares when our @potus drops bombs on children?   PEACE is more important than stocks $$$
4759 2018-01-05 19:42:57 Hi I feel like we’re playing telephone here. Stocks reaching a new high DOES NOT mean anything to more than the majority of Americans. It DOES NOT mean we have a great economy. Can we talk about this later?
4760 2018-01-05 19:42:48 I need help step by step how to start stocks I so new at this but it's be my passion for as long as I could count
4761 2018-01-05 19:41:42 Analysis: Trump's first-year jobs numbers were very, very good (Washington Post). Put the numbers on line chart (2010- 2017).  The Dow  just got a Christmas Tax gift. They're buying back stocks. Recession will come, like both W. Bush & Reagan. Trickle down does not work.

4766 2018-01-05 19:39:23 Este invierno, ¡haced los envios a tiempo con la fecha que pone en vuestra web! No os inventeis los stocks 
4767 2018-01-05 19:39:05 It´s all about many trades, I know it may seem like many shares but I hop in and out of the trades and 5k-10k shares in and out 10 times is 100k to 200000 shares which is easily attainable with a big enough account. :) #stocks #trading #Pennystocks #StockMarket

4771 2018-01-05 19:38:33 Keep an eye on nuclear energy stocks.
4772 2018-01-05 19:38:28 I just want stocks
4773 2018-01-05 19:38:18 That’s a small fraction of their overall tax benefit, which will go shareholders. The top 10% own 86% of all stocks   

Stop trying to sell this as a tax cut targeted towards the middle class.   It’s not.
4774 2018-01-05 19:37:42 NXS is one of the most demoralized gold mining stocks out there. Shorts owned that one big time.
4775 2018-01-05 19:37:41 Incredibly ignorant take for  someone who is supposed to be an MSNBC contributor. Tons of Americans own stocks and mutual funds, but you ignore that.
4776 2018-01-05 19:37:19 And...

The stock market is going up bc Trump's allies are using shell Companies with shell money to drive stocks up!

When 45 is ousted, they will deliberately withdraw their shell money to cause a deliberately CRASH...

SAUDI? CHINA? RUSSIA?

4783 2018-01-05 19:34:48 Geesh! Nice work. But why did you pick this one? I see your emails to subscribers talking about order flow and there are usually a few stocks seeing big order flow -- how did you choose $FCAU vs others (in this case)?
4784 2018-01-05 19:34:40 wait, what?  You think the stocks jumped because... of ... a contemplated... and obviously irrelevant, especially to the performance of financial markets ... investigation ... into a foundation ... that was already cleared for lack of evidence ....... ? YEEKAY.
4785 2018-01-05 19:34:26 It's pretty sick. I can buy stocks and go to jail now.
4786 2018-01-05 19:34:09 Just because u don't like trump doesnt mean that he doesn't change how the stocks progress over time he is doing a hella! job!!!!

4790 2018-01-05 19:32:50 Though not if you sell the DVD on how to trade penny stocks.
4791 2018-01-05 19:32:40 Great Blog Simon. Love the way you manage the total Portfolio rather than just individual stocks. Also like the compounding & but think you are compounding the cash rather than stocks? Interested in stops thinking, I will need to reflect on that! Well done! Terrific 2017.
4792 2018-01-05 19:32:10 The #Washingpost is such a rag, on their front page that say that stocks "soar for the rich". Are they so blind as to not realize that when the stock market goes up everyone benefits.  Most workers have a 401k or IRA.
4793 2018-01-05 19:31:40 $BYFC should bounce back strong next week. Personally, I'm more positive when I see bullish stocks drop like this because that's when they tend to bounce back stronger and reach a new higher level. 
4794 2018-01-05 19:31:10 So if stocks doing well means nothing what about when stocks go south?...is that no big deal either?

4798 2018-01-05 19:29:55 It also represents the Dow 30. If you own the wrong stocks (oils for the last few years), you can be losing $$ even in a bull market.
4799 2018-01-05 19:29:29 Well I'm glad you're happy and I'm glad you have stocks but over 50% of the country doesn't own stocks! Only people who are well-to-do on stocks for the rest of us the stock market doesn't mean s***. But you are snitty and act like you're better than everybody else you're not

4801 2018-01-05 19:29:24 Moronic assessment. Stocks are soaring for everybody, including those who invest via their retirement accounts.
4802 2018-01-05 19:29:17 There's many stocks that have already hit that 14% mark in 2018
4803 2018-01-05 19:28:56 Aren't pension funds invested in stocks? Real question.
4804 2018-01-05 19:28:55 Sorry bud it has been almost a year.. spending has been cut, taxes have been cut, stocks have been breaking records. These things are reflected in day to day activity within our nation. Trump has reversed most thing Obama put into place. That’s what has caused the economy to boom

4806 2018-01-05 19:28:46 I do in general but don't necessarily have a mental stop on everything until it/the market starts acting funky. But that's a function of trying to play some early-stage stocks out for a few months if possible. What was up with $FCAU by the way -- just order flow turn you onto it?
4807 2018-01-05 19:28:27 Hard to say how stocks will react to the continued bad news surrounding aquatic warming and the massive insurance losses faced in 2017, that will no doubt continue through 2018.
4808 2018-01-05 19:27:28 My stocks going up up up. Yep looks like you’re failing to jump on making America great and yourself money.
4809 2018-01-05 19:27:09 THE DEMOCRATS CLAIM @REALDONALDTRUMP 'S PLAN WOULDN'T WORK. NOT ONLY HAS IT INCREASE STOCKS BUT IT HAS SPARK JOBS AROUND THE WORLD. THEY CANT HIRE FAST ENOUGH

4825 2018-01-05 19:21:12 I would like to see a flat rate tax, say, 15%. All income is taxed, without loopholes. Money made on stocks, and interest is regular income. If a religious figure is paid for services, that's taxable income. Zero deductions.
4826 2018-01-05 19:21:04 "Trickle down economics" is bunk and a trash ideology.

It's why the GOP abandoned science and facts, because it never, ever gives the boost to the economy that is used to sell it. There's a placebo effect and investor confidence bump in stocks, but, it never trickles down.
4827 2018-01-05 19:20:43 I’m a bit of a Luddite when it comes to books, but I just had a notification that stocks are short, so kindle it shall be!

4837 2018-01-05 19:18:08 Stocks go up because they're going up. They go down because someone thinks they might. That's anyone knows about the stock market. Plus, gas prices are up now too. Bad for almost all of us.
4838 2018-01-05 19:17:53 so much for Dump caring about those forgotten Americans that dont have stocks or 401ks - now it's all their own fault and rich CEO's are the real responsible true Americans. Awesome.
4839 2018-01-05 19:17:48 Sure, most of these alts are a "scam"...until their worth hundreds of millions USD, sign huge partnerships, and grow penny stocks into legitimate tech companies
4840 2018-01-05 19:17:35 I probably should invest in some stocks....
4841 2018-01-05 19:17:31 Great for the rich. 80% of stocks are owned by the rich. So you are making America greater for the rich and screwing the rest of us. Just another campaign lie.

4848 2018-01-05 19:15:34 Many on main street own stocks via wall street. Teacher, firefighter, police officer, etc pensions tied to wall street also. Job growth will be lower as closer to full employment, but watch GDP, productivity and most importantly WAGES over next two years. Will crush Obama years.

4853 2018-01-05 19:14:22 Oh. Ok. 'It's time.' What a brilliant reason. And you're wrong. All tech stocks are going straight up. At least another 13%  they MUST. Not should. MUST go up the same amount as the tax cuts. 15% in total. And then they have earnings which they will all destroy.
4854 2018-01-05 19:14:08 The Stock Market is no Indikation of anything other than that big money manipulates/shuffles Stocks  for various reasons. Right now to influence Voters. Nothing else.

4857 2018-01-05 19:12:51 @TeamCavuto For those that work with your hands: 10% to 401k , 100% of any bonuses, invested heavy in stocks.  22 years at 70 to 120k / year = millionaire & retire (if your lucky, as I was, with a pension) anytime after age 59.5 Roll into fund still heavy into stocks. #Blueprint

4863 2018-01-05 19:11:41 yeah.  Great news for the 10% wealthy Americans who own 80% of stocks.  For normal folks, not so much
4864 2018-01-05 19:11:37 OK that's fine, but how many people own stocks and bond and e end know about any of that, once again lies lies lies
4865 2018-01-05 19:11:36 This is a man who does not understand publicly traded instruments. "Stocks" do not have anything to do with the underlying value of the company and certainly nothing to do with employment. They are speculative and reflect short term profit taking and access to cash.
4866 2018-01-05 19:11:20 But idk. My coworker sold her stocks after 6 months and paid for her two week Thailand trip and I’m looking at my stocks like... man look.
4867 2018-01-05 19:11:16 But we are little different to Denmark, a social democratic nation though with a different population size and economy, eg Denmark not important world stocks shares we are. We have free education to 18.
4868 2018-01-05 19:11:03 thank you. i guess it would be good to buy some bitcoin as hedge. should have think of that before. im all in in diferent altcoins (but small depot). Im a little bit used to stocks. One day in cryptos is like one month in stocks, sometimes way more.
4869 2018-01-05 19:10:33 With $SRAX and #bitcoin running... $GCAP setting up for potential EOD run magnet to $10 #stocks #swingtrade
4870 2018-01-05 19:10:21 No one is refused buying stocks. Anyone can do it. If you choose not to that's your problem!
4871 2018-01-05 19:10:14 I just have a whole different mindset. I have 1 career but I plan on having multiple.. NOT JOBS but CAREERS. 401k Stocks life insurance.. come on y’all
4872 2018-01-05 19:09:35 the highest yielding large-cap stocks in $TSX are all underperforming the $TSX as rotation away from interest sensitives continues...
4873 2018-01-05 19:09:35 in the last 10 years, the 30 Dow Industrials' stocks have drawn down -89.6% at worst and -31.7% at best from highs at the time...
4874 2018-01-05 19:09:33 cant be mad about any more mercy rework stuff when my entire facebook feed is just scottish people showing off their stocks of irn bru before THAT rework goes through
4875 2018-01-05 19:09:28 My pot stocks all took a hit yesterday but today they’re on the rise.
4876 2018-01-05 19:09:14 Hatred also comes from having no investments/stocks. If you own any (basement dwelling liberals don't) then you definitely love him ! Thank you Trump !!!! 
4877 2018-01-05 19:09:02 Half of Americans don't even own stocks
4878 2018-01-05 19:08:15 So just screw the rest of us then? I’m far from wealthy, but my retirement is heavily invested in stocks. I’ve seen more growth in my retirement in the last 12 months than I’ve seen in the last decade. Maybe now I can actually before 70. If this is the result of Trump, then 
4879 2018-01-05 19:08:13 The average everyday person does not own stocks.
4880 2018-01-05 19:07:51 Sinon vous avez des arguments en stocks?
4881 2018-01-05 19:07:13 You must be talking about traditional stocks?  Question doesn’t apply to crypto.  Entire market is evergreen
4882 2018-01-05 19:06:43 We're at a point where many traders are to nervous to buy in at these levels but just as nervous of not chasing stocks here & missing the rally- so what happens they stay on the sidelines $QQQ $SPY $IWM $EEM $DIA
4883 2018-01-05 19:06:28 Getting ready to join @cherylcasone on @FoxBusiness in 2 min. 
Packed news cycle.  Epic run in stocks.
4884 2018-01-05 19:05:56 Lol. why?  There is absolutely no reason. None. Zero. Utterly zilch. No reasons for a pullback. Stocks should go up the same amount of the tax break. And that's 15%  we aren't even at 3.
4885 2018-01-05 19:05:43 After about an hour and a half on hold, I reached someone at TD Waterhouse. I was told that all the brokerages in Canada are swamped because of massive buying and selling of stocks connected to the marijuana business. The brokerages often tell clients it is technical problem.
4886 2018-01-05 19:05:33 Because it's bs. Who cares. Taxes are down, my 401k is kicking ass and my stocks are doing great. Go snuggle with Harvey!
4887 2018-01-05 19:05:14 Just pick up 30 Jan 12 $aapl 175 calls

4889 2018-01-05 19:05:01 This market is now in bigger fool territory.  The coming correction could easily turn into a recession.
If you don't know what that means.  Don't invest in stocks - the current valuations are based on emotion not physical fact.
4890 2018-01-05 19:04:57 You can't blame anyone for taking some profits cause we all do but please do it smart.  Do not sell massive chunks of stocks in large sell orders.  It just drives down the price and even hurts your sell.  Lets make sure everyone gets rich!!!
4891 2018-01-05 19:04:54 If I had stocks, I would sell that shit right now and invest it in something much safer. The market is gonna crash and crash hard when it does.
4892 2018-01-05 19:04:54 Not getting back in till some positive buys & hold on levels. No doubt $NTFL will return to previous pps and then some. On close watch!

4894 2018-01-05 19:03:55 @luciancastillo just wanna let you know that when I told us to invest in Fiat Chrysler stocks two years ago it was at like $6 now it’s at over $21

4896 2018-01-05 19:02:56 The average American has zero in the stock market only the rich can afford it and you are making the rich richer by snake charming your #idiot base that foes not have stocks either.

Our question: When will prisons release the hundreds of black men & women serving time for selling weed?
4900 2018-01-05 19:01:03 Amazing. Record high stocks. Record low unemployment.  3+% GDP.  NK at negotiating table. ISIS on the run. Consumer confidence high. Illegal immigration down.  Regulations shrinking. Tax cuts helping middle class. Businesses reinvesting. BUT let’s talk about tell-all books MSM!?!
4901 2018-01-05 19:00:34 i swear egalitarian is good bc its equality
4902 2018-01-05 19:00:30 I don't own any stocks but my 401k is soaring.  I am also not rich by any means.   Nothing our President does will ever be good enough for Democrats unless Obama did it.  Sad and pathetic.
4903 2018-01-05 19:00:23 I wasn't going 2 butt heads with/U. But Trumps investments 4 the most part were not in stocks He was 80% invested  NYC real-estate He took advantage of the  stock crash & Black Monday he bought buildings on the cheap via leveraged loans Some  came back 2 bit him.

4906 2018-01-05 18:59:18 Will Trump/Sessions DoJ manipulate the marijuana market to the advantage of certain corporate friends? Who was snapping up cannabis stocks after they took a drive in the wake of Session's announcement? Someone should look into this.
4907 2018-01-05 18:58:46 Yay for the richest 10% who own 84% of all stocks! TIC

4909 2018-01-05 18:58:19 stocks are the one thing hardly anyone in this country buys on sale. but that keeps me in business, so carry on

4911 2018-01-05 18:57:58 It's era of artificial intelligence to trade stocks.
The person will continue to increase the money without having to work even one second.
4912 2018-01-05 18:57:36 Excellent reviewnot least because I mirrored many of your holdings & learnings in real time.Key2018 theme is to keep aware individual stocks specific role in folio ie $ value/income (GME) or non cyclical growth&income (GAW) so that overall risk/structure is as I intended
4913 2018-01-05 18:57:27 If not 20% of the country hold stocks so what? Certainly not helpful to me. This means nothing to my bottom line. I lost it in 2009.
4914 2018-01-05 18:57:26 Gotta keep those prison stocks high! Private prison owners are big donors.
4915 2018-01-05 18:57:11 - I reported my intentions of selling stocks.
- In october, you knew about this shit since june.
4916 2018-01-05 18:57:09 While @CNN, @MSNBC and the rest of the #FakeNewsMedia are talking about a BS book, STOCKS SET NEW RECORDS, Fed Gov Cut 16k Jobs in '17, added 196K in Manufacturing jobs, BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT RECORD LOW, Food stamp recipients down 2 MILLION. #Priorities
4917 2018-01-05 18:57:03 I own no stocks. My property taxes are 14,500 a year. Yeah thats right. Im screwed
4918 2018-01-05 18:56:51 lol.... I mainly trade OTC and lower flow stocks, rarely are on TV getting bashed or over loved. Typically i hold longer periods at a time. If I want to trade, I go into MU, and those types...but I tend to suck at that.
4919 2018-01-05 18:55:58 You need to get new leaf
4920 2018-01-05 18:54:32 Stocks wouldn’t be lol
4921 2018-01-05 18:54:17 TERRIFIC BREAKOUT $GOOGL  #80 overall. Best Stocks Now App   I remain long.
4922 2018-01-05 18:54:06 Stocks have been rising because companies are buying stocks back and driving the price up, other companies are passing on tax savings to stock holders which again drives prices up. Until we see average wages at $15 an hour, the new tax plan is only making the wealthy richer.

4924 2018-01-05 18:53:53 Tech glamour stocks, $GOOGL, $AMZN, $NFLX are on fire.
4925 2018-01-05 18:53:46 I get that you don’t like Obama, but let’s be intellectually honest here, the economy hasn’t changed much since 1/21/17. Stocks have been climbing for years, unemployment has been dropping for years. Disdain aside, what’s truly different?
4926 2018-01-05 18:53:38 Combined with pension/demographics situation in the US & importance of stocks to 65% of US GDP that is consumption, that is why i keep saying it's literally a matter of US national security that stocks rise ad infinitum, on low volatility.
4927 2018-01-05 18:53:37 Agree 100%.... what will happen when a 2000-2002 (50% decline in stocks), 2007-2009 (50% decline), or 1929-1932 (89% decline) bear market arrives?   Not saying that type of move is imminent, but it will happen again at some point down the road.

4929 2018-01-05 18:52:40 Well... in the short term, the tax cut will increase valuations since the rich are getting richer and therefore buying more stocks. 
Eventually tho the middle class is gonna get pinched and that’s prolly gonna hurt. So ????
4930 2018-01-05 18:52:36 By cancel, I meant cancelled by the supplier due to lack of stocks. Should that be the case, you will be refunded.
4931 2018-01-05 18:52:18 Yes...as long as stocks rise up & to the right, ad infinitum, on low volatility.  If stocks fall on a sustained basis, you have negative current account & negative financial account = "Houston, we have a problem."  That problem will require big helicopter $ or big USD deval.
4932 2018-01-05 18:52:15 Indeed...especially since most people do not have stocks. There will be a bear market sometime within the next two years, lets see if @realDonaldTrump takes credit for that

4940 2018-01-05 18:49:56 That's because it isn't that big of a deal..it happens all the time and has been for a few years. What you don't mention is that that really only benefits the rich. Much of the poor and middle class don't have stocks.
4941 2018-01-05 18:49:18 i wish i can do everything as "set it and forget it". thats what i'm hoping to find LOL

$bita has been a good example of that recently but so have all the china stocks
4942 2018-01-05 18:48:56 What you're actually saying here is that corps didnt raise wages.  The increase in DJIA is proof that companies will invest in their own stocks and sharholders, not wages.  Read a book.

4948 2018-01-05 18:47:21 it's clear the size of a portfolio is EXTREMELY important to you as a measure of success, but you might regret bragging so hard about this when stocks go down.

Also, a country's success is based on more than the stock market.

4981 2018-01-05 18:36:17 Making the rich richer. You are not proving the betterment of overall society. The tax bill has only allowed the wealthy corporations to by back the stocks that were out.

4993 2018-01-05 18:32:16 fuck off with ur big words
4994 2018-01-05 18:31:42 Obviously your out of touch with the midland and south, the majority of which do not own stocks and do not see how this helps them!
4995 2018-01-05 18:31:42 Stocks are pricing in perfect and it's not perfect now  nor is it ever. Now,  oil, I like.
4996 2018-01-05 18:31:32 I forgot that the stock market is the indicator of the success and prosperity of the average American. Please let me know when anyone who doesn't have tens of thousands of dollars in stocks benefits.
4997 2018-01-05 18:31:27 I believe my local nursery stocks hairy plants.
4998 2018-01-05 18:31:17 Oh ya. I have heard of the Toplet bomb problem. 

I guess I’m frustrated because my the 99% hasn’t seen anything of value (medical cures, technology, financial reset). They keep bragging that the stocks are up 9000 points but the economy feels worst, not better.
4999 2018-01-05 18:30:58 @CoachJones007 my comment is about stock market, anyone with 401K or IRA with mutual funds or stocks benefit with rising market. #politiansRtools
5000 2018-01-05 18:30:37 Bitcoin made everyone an expert in stocks and markets
5001 2018-01-05 18:30:32 There was still a further run-up in stocks of variable degree the other 4 times this occurred going back to 2004, but then... 2/
5002 2018-01-05 18:30:19 A weighted-average of 30 stocks is not a good reflection of the economy, LOL.
5003 2018-01-05 18:30:15 Stocks dont rise on corporate profits, they rise on ppl betting on how profitable or not profitable companies will be in quarter or year,  the daily index is a useless barometer of economy

5005 2018-01-05 18:29:39 Most stocks down at the .10-.20 cent level are highly speculative plays every now and then you can find value but mostly loto tickets
5006 2018-01-05 18:29:12 Hi can you advise is your Edinburgh store stocks the full Fenty make up  foundation range? @HarveyNichols
5007 2018-01-05 18:29:06 If you got some pictures on Facebook and people start to share do that mean you own some stocks?
5008 2018-01-05 18:29:04 The problem is basic. Give a billionaire 10,000,000 and he'll buy stocks or sock it away. Give families making 40,000 a decent raise and they buy cars, washers and dryers and a house. THERE demand is created. Creating MORE decent jobs with decent wages that THEY SPEND.
5009 2018-01-05 18:28:35 I used to have CNBC, Bloomberg, BNN, and CNN on at the same time during trading hours. Now NONE! I now just watch 65 live charts of stocks on my watchlist. This way I found is better for me.
5010 2018-01-05 18:28:23 Auschwitz is America now can you see ? Fema camps are built for the homeless imagine how many there will be. Your stocks have fell & fell I bet billion they will fall the hardest this time. Those with bitcoin it's only good as the head that sits on the shoulders easy remove.

5013 2018-01-05 18:28:00 I bought stocks on 2nd test of 9687. I don't compare Nifty n stocks. So throughout 7900 to current levels I have been buying stocks. Yes I booked profits also.

5016 2018-01-05 18:26:16 Even after a huge 2017 for Ethereum it could still be very undervalued. We expect it’s usage growth rate to increase exponentially over the next few years

5017 2018-01-05 18:26:10 The volume in ICO’s and shitty alts is significantly higher than penny stocks. Plus a ton of penny stocks get jumps by “considering pivoting to blockchain”
5018 2018-01-05 18:25:51 Dont forget to mention $V. 
Luv them stocks.
5019 2018-01-05 18:25:44 .@TommyCoyneBN1 @NottsArsenal Probably the trickiest part is mastering sauces and stocks, after that the sky's the limit.
5020 2018-01-05 18:25:26 To reiterate. Study the best-performing stocks every week within your timeframe and that will tell you what is true or not.
5021 2018-01-05 18:24:56 You do KNOW that most Americans have little, if anything, in the market? and most of gains are going to the wealthy!The rich are far more likely to own stocks than middle or working-class families!
5022 2018-01-05 18:24:56 Problem with majority of mid cap stocks is they are heavily indebted following the years of depressed oil price. Same in US. Ophr is the only one im watching.
5023 2018-01-05 18:24:48 Schools in Baltimore don't have heat, but hey everyone, stocks are up!
5024 2018-01-05 18:23:54 Stocks getting extended, puts are getting very cheap, and earnings season picks up in 2 weeks, don't be a Hog...good time to make some risk mgmt. moves to hedge event-risk

5029 2018-01-05 18:21:23 His supporters have no money in stocks and will lose their 401k’s (if they even have that) when deregulation lets brokers gamble it away like in 2007.

5031 2018-01-05 18:20:51 When the Menace had almost NOTHING to do with any of the above, yes.  Stocks grew %wise more under Obama. Fact. And, unless you are invested in the stock market, it means nothing. That is approx. 70% of the country. I could go on, but it would fall on deaf, dumb & blind ears...
5032 2018-01-05 18:20:27 It’s not all me who alerts the picks! I got $YGE from you guys! Trust me I look at all the stocks you ask me about! :)
Team effort.
5033 2018-01-05 18:20:13 I'm finding out that almost all successful traders focus on relative strengths 1st. Of course beaten down stocks can recover, but more often than not they're beaten down for a reason. Appreciate that u always respond. Couple of "gurus" here never. They think they're too good!
5034 2018-01-05 18:20:01 Why do you think that is the case? What’s your view between the disparity of the rise in Brent and O&G mid cap stocks that have not been aligned?
5035 2018-01-05 18:19:13 Over 50% of people in the country are not invested in the market...how does this affect you...that was what people quoted when Obama was in office...what changed? Nothing they still don't own stocks they're waiting for coal jobs #FactsDontCareAboutYourFeelings
5036 2018-01-05 18:19:11 Yeay we are all rich because we all gamble in the stock market!  Lol , oh, that’s right,it’s just corporations inflating their own stocks and most Americans aren’t even invested in the market.

5044 2018-01-05 18:17:13 Do you own stock? Stocks will go down it's only a matter of when
Are you employed? Job growth is lowest since 2010
Due to the tax law changes interest rates will go up, housing values will drop and wages will remain stagnant.
I can't wait!!!!!!!!
5045 2018-01-05 18:17:03 When it comes to digital currency or stocks the key is to buy when it’s low and sell when it’s high or hold long term
5046 2018-01-05 18:16:43 I got a pay raise, 80$ more monthy tax cut.  My dad's 401k up 12% his stocks up higher than ever.  But I'm guessing you have non of this.
5047 2018-01-05 18:16:43 Trump wants to talk about the stock market like he has anything to do with it. Even if he did, less that 50% of Americans have stocks.
5048 2018-01-05 18:16:27 "Stocks are cheap" - White House swamp creature to CNBC today
5049 2018-01-05 18:16:02 yes, you can use it as a filter. I would recommend reading 'Stocks On The Move' by Andreas Clenow. He uses exponential regression to rank stocks, the ave % move per day.
5050 2018-01-05 18:15:54 While everybody pats themselves on the back for their "brilliant" calls, please do care to remind us of the many you are also getting wrong at the same time. Thx. #crypto #stocks

5054 2018-01-05 18:15:05 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.
5055 2018-01-05 18:14:57 Big Question = Will the big #banks go (#DeutscheBank, #HSBC, #Barclays +++)? If so = 1929! #BlackMonday #Stocks
5056 2018-01-05 18:14:28 You live in a fantasy world and obviously know nothing about how th economy operates, how employment & capital investment decisions are made and what drives the stock market. The stock market looks FORWARD. Why on earth would stocks have rocketed up based on anything Zero did?
5057 2018-01-05 18:14:23 Hi @kairyssdal @Marketplace are we in a wide  economic asset bubble?  Real estate up. Stocks up.  Bonds doing okay?  Unemployment down. Crypto way way way up.  Commodities up?  Rich getting richer.  9yr birthday of this bull market coming up!
5058 2018-01-05 18:12:10 The first writing task for today (January 5, 2018) is a large project on bitcoin-related penny stocks.
5059 2018-01-05 18:11:59 No problem. yes exactly. You have to find out what works for you based on what you believe in. And studying the best-performing stocks within your timeframe is a great to shape your beliefs.
5060 2018-01-05 18:11:47 I am frustrated. Most of the stocks I closed 2017 with appear to be ones that nobody wants in 2018. I may have to take this year off #frack
5061 2018-01-05 18:11:37 They, like many conservatives, didn't take Obama's economy into account. Not to mention stocks are not a metric for economic wealth, but projected earnings of investors.
5062 2018-01-05 18:11:34 gotta give stocks time to digest.  they setup patterns on daily charts but they can still be choppy as hell for days/weeks..  just focus on the support and resistance levels within the pattern as key zones to add or sell.  never chase a stock thats already broken out of a pattern
5063 2018-01-05 18:11:21 Stocks soared for me too. I have a lot more money than I did 2 years ago. I’m not rich, that being said I will be if my accounts continue on the path they are on. Obama did a fantastic job!! My account started growing on his watch.

5065 2018-01-05 18:10:36 Dow only 30 stocks. Only 102,000 new jobs,  below expectation. Cite stats for last lie. President? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
5066 2018-01-05 18:10:24 I doubt you could make money on stocks if it weren't for commissions.
5067 2018-01-05 18:10:22 People keep thinking I'm short, I'm not. I own a lot of stocks, but I also have eyes and ears and a memory.
5068 2018-01-05 18:09:59 Apparently FANG stocks can go up forever with  no price ceiling for this group $FB $GOOG $GOOGL $NFLX $AMZN - they never get expensive because valuation never seems to matter for these names
5069 2018-01-05 18:09:39 For me no targets
Golden time for this sector
Even after such a run, stocks not correcting more than 15% to 20% from peaks roughly. I wont try to sell exactly at higher price. Without any negative news flow they can go long way

5070 2018-01-05 18:09:25 Had a long drive today so caught up on some investing podcasts. US stocks are up 35% since election but S&P adding another 1000 points in the next 12 months now seems to consensus. ‘Melt up’ ‘global synchronised growth’ and ‘parabolic’ were the most used phrases!
5071 2018-01-05 18:08:31 Think it is down to the weather but agree oil has been bullish, the stocks have been behind need to rerate
5072 2018-01-05 18:07:18 Fingers crossed. Thanks for the tip!  I also got most of my $ with $imlff & $sprwf .. It seems like Canadian #weed stocks are much more stable than American ones.
5073 2018-01-05 18:07:13 Trying to take advantage of investor euphoria/ FOMO & greed crowd analyst are qucikly raising price targets even on stocks with extreme parabolic moves $QQQ $SPY $DIA $IWM $EEM
5074 2018-01-05 18:07:10 I trusted investment companies......had a guy from a Green Bay company (Packerland) admit to me he could not pick stocks......lost a bunch!!!
5075 2018-01-05 18:06:56 Doubtful.  Since the '09 China has grown credit outstanding by $20t. In 2015 they halted dozens of stocks for long periods. Last year the restricted foreign companies from repatriating funds. Its going to be a long, long time before China is viewed as attractively as it was then.
5076 2018-01-05 18:06:32 Maybe middle and upper middle. I don’t know too many average people with stocks (aside from the 401k they don’t monitor). And if these booms mean so much, why aren’t NORMAL people feeling more financially stable?
5077 2018-01-05 18:05:59 yea.. stocks only go up, right?
5078 2018-01-05 18:05:43 That means nothing to the average persons pocketbook. Only helpful if you have stocks.
5079 2018-01-05 18:05:35 I think if you look at my charts you will get a good idea of what I'm looking for. You can also take a look at the best-performing stocks within your time frame and that will tell you a whole lot about what is important and not.
5080 2018-01-05 18:05:19 Trains Stocks are fine for this. Has the better positioned ones. Woodford lost the plot a while ago with his illiquid speculative nonsense
5081 2018-01-05 18:05:07 This entire GOP would be wise to invest in antacid stocks - their sales are going through the roof with these asshats and their blatant corruption. Every one of them looks stressed to the max!

5083 2018-01-05 18:04:08 Locking in a few profits for the weekend. Letting some run but did take about 50% of my mj out. Wanted to go to cash for the weekend. Will pick up some $BTC stocks for the weekend with the profit
5084 2018-01-05 18:04:05 the stock market has NOTHING to do with the economy, and hasn't in decades. average Americans don't own stocks, that's a rich person's game. normal people don't give a rat's arse about the stock market, so why would mainstream media make a big deal?
5085 2018-01-05 18:03:39 Wouldn’t stocks move based on speculation and projections , wages move on a effect after the projects?
5086 2018-01-05 18:03:12 In a fairly valued market such as this, it’s tough to find any stock opportunities at a discount. General Electric (GE) has been beaten down all year, I added to my holding of it before the end of the year. Stock is up 6% this week alone! More to come. #GE #stocks
5087 2018-01-05 18:02:54 Most don't own stocks.....learned my lesson....dont listen to anyone about any stock....especially if they are on t.v.!!!!
5088 2018-01-05 18:01:37 Unless u have an ntuc that's 24hours and stocks swensens ice cream
5089 2018-01-05 18:01:33 If you dug into this I bet you'd find it was really all about shorting Canadian cannabis stocks.

5100 2018-01-05 17:58:47 In regards to the last sentence......where is that value? Do I, as an average American with no extra money to put in stocks, see or feel the trillions in value?
5101 2018-01-05 17:58:44 Out of 50 stocks in the Nifty50 index, 31 settled in the green, while 19 stocks closed the day in the red.

5104 2018-01-05 17:58:27 What? Why are you talking about stocks? And do what? SMMFH you can’t even troll properly
5105 2018-01-05 17:58:11 Yes, I bought stocks and had options before your recommendation - both doing well
5106 2018-01-05 17:57:08 90% of your voters couldn’t care less about the stock market and own ZERO stocks!

5109 2018-01-05 17:56:16 Market Wrap Jan 5, 2017:
The equities market closed the week on a positive note as it appreciated by 0.64%. Profit taking set in as expected, particularly in the banking sector stocks. The rally continued in the Bonds market with interest especially on the Mar 2027 bond.

5114 2018-01-05 17:55:01 Do ppl not know that an alarmingly large portion of these stocks being purchased since the election are "foreign investors"? Screw the Dow! How about lowering the national debt instead of raising it and leaving  it for our children & grandchildren to inherit?

5117 2018-01-05 17:54:15 Yes, that’s why it may not be a good time to buy! Correction is bound to happen and many stocks are overvalued.
5118 2018-01-05 17:53:56 MBS fall to session lows after the mixed jobs data. Stocks holding modest gains. 10-yr yield edges higher to 2.47%.

5122 2018-01-05 17:53:08 What do they mean, "stocks soar for rich?" They soared for all of us. Stocks don't know who own them. They don't know if the people are rich or poor. Maybe the stocks soared for the intelligent.
5123 2018-01-05 17:52:56 Stocks soar for 401k retirements too.
5124 2018-01-05 17:52:39 It does say anything about the economy. Stock trading is boosted by company stock buy backs. This market will soon collapse. Stocks have nothing to do with jobs or production, hint they don’t affect GDP.
5125 2018-01-05 17:52:37 @JBoorman I was wondering..Do you use ATR in anyway when selecting stocks?Thanks
5126 2018-01-05 17:52:35 Maybe we should also have DCF based price caps on stocks so that no one makes usurious returns :-)
5127 2018-01-05 17:52:29 The Stock Market isn’t an indictator of economic well-being for most people in UK. It is about stocks & shares being cheap at the moment due to a low pound & wealthy foreign investors. Make no mistake: this wealth doesn’t trickle down to the poor Brexit voters in Northern towns.
5128 2018-01-05 17:51:54 Only 50% own stocks bc Dems rejected Bush's plan to privatize SS which would have given every worker in America a stake.

Stock gains raise tax revenue, lead to increased capital investment and accelerate innovation.

Stop rooting against your country!!!
5129 2018-01-05 17:51:30 @profgalloway Thanks for all your amazing videos, insights, the new book THE FOUR! I know you're a swanky rich guy these days and stocks have always been a part of your DNA so how about letting me show you why a Dynamic Brands portfolio makes sense for you? 700bps ALPHA in 2017
5130 2018-01-05 17:51:24 I sent you the raw data. It is quite clear 2017 was not the best year in stock market history.  It was a good year but not the best. I have owned stocks for many years, trust me, I know. 
5131 2018-01-05 17:50:36 Nej, du läste fel. Testa att läsa den här meningen en extra gång: "I still think stocks will reach an index of 50 (from the current 100) before gong to 200"

5139 2018-01-05 17:47:47 Most people with an IRA or 401(k) do not invest 100% of their money in stocks. If they are advised properly they should have a mix, but many are so distrustful of Wall St, that they have all of it a low yielding guaranteed fund. Another lie.
5140 2018-01-05 17:47:40 I remember in 2016 a biotech company IR guy yelled in the lobby of the Handerly something to the effect of "you guys need to be buying!  Don't you know you won't make money if the stocks don't go up!"
5141 2018-01-05 17:47:28 This is not the whole story. This regression with stock ownership began in 2008. Those of us not in the top 10% are still pretty stinking happy with our portfolio performance under Trump. Loving that you are taking a potshot at stocks too. That’s helpful.

5143 2018-01-05 17:46:15 You do understand thats less than 1/3 of our population. 

That means more than 200 million people don't. Which means the stocks soaring help less than 1/3 of us.
5144 2018-01-05 17:45:43 Are your plays only on stocks above certain MA such as 8 EMA or doesn't matter as long it's showing strength?
5145 2018-01-05 17:45:26 Weed stocks went up like 20% for two days, then yesterday lost 25%.

The hilarity of the market coming down off a weed high was not lost on me.
5146 2018-01-05 17:45:20 I’ve put more effort into investing and watching stocks in the past few months than anything and it’s starting to pay off.
5147 2018-01-05 17:45:20 WRONG!!! Everyone who has a 401K plan has benefited greatly, as had Seniors whose saving are invested in stocks.
5148 2018-01-05 17:44:45 If you buy stocks $MYSZ expected to hit at least $2 a share next week, better hop on this train asap

5150 2018-01-05 17:44:13 Of 326 million population 246 million are over 18!

Of the 246 million 100 million have IRAs & 401Ks. 

Of that group many more have retirement plans with stocks. 

Of that State pension plans have stocks

So the extent of the stock market boom is extensive. 

Take a knee!

5154 2018-01-05 17:43:38 The stock market does nothing for the average American. Do you realize that half of us cannot afford to buy stocks? WHO GIVES A F ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE MONEY YOU ARE MAKING! WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR ME?
5155 2018-01-05 17:43:37 80% of Americans don't own stocks
5156 2018-01-05 17:43:24 sales growth of S&P yoy is roughly 4.8%
you need sales to boost stocks, or more money in circulation, or rates dropping, or commodities dropping
we have wages stagnant to dropping as headcounts drop, money tightening, rates rising, commodities flat to rising

5158 2018-01-05 17:43:08 A few plutocrats getting wealthy at the expense of the rest of us.

That’s what it means when stocks and/or profits are soaring but wages are stagnant.

That’s not such a good thing.
5159 2018-01-05 17:42:54 You do know the Dow is from stocks that are owned by the rich and not by you right? It's not a measurement of performance.

5164 2018-01-05 17:41:31 Stocks are only for "the rich"? Someone better tell all the middle-class 401K holders.
5165 2018-01-05 17:41:19 I'm of two minds about investing right now.
1) Oh boy, I just opened up an investing account. This'll be fun!

2) Wait, fuck, I'm not a stockbroker. I remember reading that when regular people start thinking they should get into stocks: get the fuck out.
5166 2018-01-05 17:41:16 It's not always favorable to buy stocks on a green day.

5168 2018-01-05 17:41:03 The job growth rate has actually slowed under you. Most Americans don’t own stock. Actually, only 50% own stock (this includes 401Ks). The richest 1% own 40% of the stocks. The top 20% own 90%. Most of America is left out.
5169 2018-01-05 17:40:46 Massive bounce on Marijuana Stocks! These $GRWC gifts won't last long imo
5170 2018-01-05 17:40:40 The only reason for these numbers is your tax plan geared for the rich for the investors here in US.
With the global growth & the dollar weaker foreign investors are buying stocks cuz they know you're going to roll back legislation, making it more business-friendly.

5172 2018-01-05 17:39:59 @stockpile How come my money is still unavailable for transfer after more than a week? Stocks I've ordered not showing up? Messages to support unanswered? No confirmations being made on my account?
5173 2018-01-05 17:39:54 Its it illegal to sell stocks this way?
5174 2018-01-05 17:39:53 My advice to young investors... Research & Analyse 4-5 stocks only, instead of more & more. Mastering 4-5 stock will be having more possibility of turning you to be wealthier instead of 100 and so on stocks.

You are just a stock away from becoming billionaire.
5175 2018-01-05 17:39:20 And an hour ago you said bad jobs numbers, possible recession. Which is it old man? Btw, stocks have nothing to do with real people.
5176 2018-01-05 17:39:01 1/2 The crazy spike in BTC created this in two ways: 1) created a ton of paper profits to "diversify" into other coins with and 2) hooked all the people who missed out and who are now bidding up the "penny stocks" It's Vancouver w/o the dodgey mines.
5177 2018-01-05 17:38:10 @TheView Meghan you need to stopped defending trump he is causing his own problems. We can't spend money we make on the stocks if we are in middle of a nuclear warbaboooom!!!!! Reality of trumps administration

5182 2018-01-05 17:36:50 He'd probably advise them to but stocks. He knows nothing about the average working American.
5183 2018-01-05 17:36:41 Time is on your side ;) the stocks will add up every single month even with a small contribution! Keep pushing!
5184 2018-01-05 17:36:38 as much as i love the hype of marijuana stocks because its not Trump talk, marijuana is extremely bad for the health and i am not looking forward to people smoking it (maybe driving high) and then using the already limited resources in the health care system.

5187 2018-01-05 17:36:10 Indeed.
Just think - once the nervous buyers finally use all their cash ‘on the sidelines’ to buy stocks - the sellers who receive that cash in exchange for their stocks will start a whole new pile. 

Oh. Wait a minute... 
5188 2018-01-05 17:36:03 $ACAN ~ this is the only one not recovering yet despite most of pot stocks are green now.
5189 2018-01-05 17:35:51 Stock Market "value" doesn't create jobs like DJT believes. Only advantages are for people who can afford to invest. 
Remember 2008? Many lost "wealth" because stocks tanked due to overleveraging and unfair practices. Where is the protection against a repeat of that?
5190 2018-01-05 17:35:47 You prob don’t know this, but your average American doesn’t have any money invested in stocks. Mmmkay?
5191 2018-01-05 17:35:13 Maybe wrong stocks?
5192 2018-01-05 17:35:13 Sessions is a blessing in disguise. load load load your boat, up with stocks of weed!

5200 2018-01-05 17:33:33 About 85,000,000 Americans are invested in the stock market. This leaves about 245,000,000 who are not. To generate economic activity put money in the hands of wage earners and they spend it. Give it to 1% & corps and they buy back stocks and give dividends.
5201 2018-01-05 17:32:52 They said back then the sky is failing the bull is not running when in fact we crashed so low many stocks were a great buy.  Such as home depot, people still needed hammers to repair etc. They are saying that similarly to LLOY or LYG regarding BREXIT. That is why I said that.

5209 2018-01-05 17:30:50 It’s just for consistency and uniformity and to show there can be something there even tho it isn’t at that point. Think banks or stocks or business where people pay prorated sums or installments. Kobo must enter but I feel you sha.
5210 2018-01-05 17:30:15 Perhaps each state should "nationalize" its telecom infrastructure. Swap local public utility stocks for local assets and personnel state-by-state.

5221 2018-01-05 17:28:02 Bingo. Here and on the show. Some of the big gamblers and risk junkies are leaving the market for cryptocurrencies. Stocks are stable due to algo trading and adreneline junkies playing crypto.
5222 2018-01-05 17:27:56 Have a question from a friend. I use @MarketSmith  and love it. He wants to know of other programs out there that you use to screen for stocks? TY for your input!
5223 2018-01-05 17:27:55 But apparently they own of a lot of stocks, because they're always super excited about what the stock market is doing. 
5224 2018-01-05 17:27:43 And consider that the top 10% of Americans own 81% of stocks just proves further that Trump's economy isn't as peachy as he tries to make people think.
5225 2018-01-05 17:26:23 Obama vs Trump the last year of his term he got in the last month 1.86 million jobs trumps last 11 months 1.7 million jobs yes Wall Street is off the hook,but once they settle down and stop buying their own stocks it will come to a halt some are projecting a bad halt.
5226 2018-01-05 17:26:18 Currently, the only thing keeping Ontario going is the stock market bubble - it is allowing Sr's and Corps to claim equity increases,  Most Corps are buying back their own stocks - I know it is a bubble - everyone knows it is - the question becomes when will it break?
5227 2018-01-05 17:26:12 Why Don’t Millennials Have Stocks and Healthy Retirement Plans
5228 2018-01-05 17:25:59 84% of all stocks are owned by the richest 10% of our country, and yet this narrative of Wall Street= our economy marches on. This is not a liberal/conservative issue- much of the lower and middle classes are equally affected regardless of party affiliation.
5229 2018-01-05 17:25:52 Do you want to sleep in the dungeons of Windsor Castle or be put in the stocks  then follow advice above
5230 2018-01-05 17:25:34 Fewer than half of Americans have investment in stocks.  ALL of us have investment in wages.  And WAGES ARE FLAT.  WAGES ARE FLAT.  WAGES ARE FLAT.

5236 2018-01-05 17:24:27 Really.... I thought more people would own when you include 401ks... that’s sad America start saving. Dividend stocks are the best investment
5237 2018-01-05 17:24:13 Agreed and that is why when people show me GDP figures and come up with stupifying assumptions such as debt to GDP over X means growth lower than Y, I tend to go meh...Conflating stocks and flows for one, they do not have the whole picture 2nd...
5238 2018-01-05 17:23:50 This is great, if you have stocks! There are other realities that must be seriously considered. I want nothing more than for all of the country to get better and for all to be able to enjoy life! Not just the rich!

5248 2018-01-05 17:21:50 People keep asking me: Phil, how is your wealth diversified? Well:

10% stocks and bonds
5% cryptocurrency
25% magic the gathering rares
10% N64 cartridges
50% acid reflux pills
5249 2018-01-05 17:21:46 Except, @realDonaldTrump knows that world economies are expanding, rates are low, no other place to put your $$, so stocks grind higher....

5251 2018-01-05 17:21:30 Aside from the fact that the job growth rate has actually slowed under Trump, this idiot must think most Americans own stock. Actually, only 50% own stock (this includes 401Ks). The richest 1% own 40% of the stocks. The top 20% own 90%. Most of America is left out.

5274 2018-01-05 17:16:58 Wouldn't count my chickens just yet. Buy back of stocks is already happening.
5275 2018-01-05 17:16:56 To say everyone benefitted is bs. Most gains from a very small number of stocks and not all options avail. Most should have gained almost as much as under PBO during same time period.

5278 2018-01-05 17:16:37 In a 13.2% gold up-year like 2017, the HUI really should’ve leveraged that by 2x to 3x to enjoy solid annual gains of 26.4% to 39.7%.  Yet because investors weren’t interested in either gold or its miners’ stocks, the HUI languished with that miserable 5.5% gain last year.

5287 2018-01-05 17:15:15 MBS fall to session lows after the mixed jobs data. Stocks holding modest gains. 10-yr yield edges higher to 2.47%.
5288 2018-01-05 17:14:52 You should have stocks in your ref hihihi. Biscuits, candies, junk food, drinks
5289 2018-01-05 17:14:30 The fact that so many people could believe that the president really watched something called the gorilla channel for 17 hrs a day just sums up how respected and credible a leader the man is. But the stocks are still up (since 09) so we don’t give a fuck how much of a joke he is
5290 2018-01-05 17:14:21 .@realDonaldTrump When there is an ignorant conman in the W.H. with the help of Russia, that is the BIGGEST story and will continue to be until your obstruction or money launderung is proven. Why wouldn't stocks go up when the republicans just gave millions to corporations?
5291 2018-01-05 17:14:20 With earnings season ahead it's a win/ win situation -an eanings beat stocks will skyrocket , an earnings miss pullback is now viewd as an opportunity to get in & buy the dip $QQQ $SPY $DIA $IWM $EEM
5292 2018-01-05 17:14:13 I can't digest the idea of a hospital running to make profits and hence no direct investments in any hospital stocks. It might be a good idea but a wrong incentive system aimed at fleecing patients and treating them as numbers and KPIs.
5293 2018-01-05 17:14:07 Oh, but don’t u know. It was Obummer that caused the stocks to go up. Wait. That might be because he is no longer president Duh.
5294 2018-01-05 17:14:07 You guys are do the dishonesty investors are just piling in watching your shows stocks already fat at all this and patriation and taxes but you guys will be telling people how when the markets crash will the warning signs were there@HalftimeReport
5295 2018-01-05 17:14:04 @OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER @AriFleischer is correct...do not care about the book; doesn’t affect my family! Wages are up, stocks are up! @realDonaldTrump is doing what he said he would do!
5296 2018-01-05 17:13:49 So according to the Halftime guys on CNBC it’s totally reasonable to protect against inflation and higher rates that haven’t happened in 42 and 35 years, respectively, but if you want to hedge against a downside move in stocks you’re a perma-bearish moron
5297 2018-01-05 17:13:42 So you are saying if I try to sell my stocks..I wont get any cash for them? LMAO

5303 2018-01-05 17:12:38 Did you mention the #TaxScamBill is going to help middle class!? Well, it looks like the fat boys of wall street are buying back stocks rather than investing on innovation on job growth. Lied! Again!

5317 2018-01-05 17:08:46 Can’t remember if I responded.  If your broker has an IPO center, they list stocks that are going to IPO and you can buy i then. I did it with up coming Cannabis growth opportunities fund.  Just depends which brokers they go through
5318 2018-01-05 17:08:01 People in stocks gotta love it! Mr . President sir you rock!
5319 2018-01-05 17:07:21 No President ever talked up the daily movements of the stock market like Trump has because of risk that taking too much credit for the fickle market makes it more difficult to avoid criticism when stocks eventually retreat which they always do.
5320 2018-01-05 17:07:17 Oh Don, you're so witty.  Like Ariel, I'll enjoy the money I'm making on my stocks and my 401k.  While I'm winning, you enjoy making love to your sister.  Don't go away mad, though. Just go away!
5321 2018-01-05 17:07:13 Are there any stocks that are Actually Down?
5322 2018-01-05 17:06:45 Really? How many Trump supporters trade stocks?
5323 2018-01-05 17:06:32 It’s about a bubble, is what it’s about. If you are nearing retirement age, folks, diversify your portfolio; don’t keep it all in stocks. That is, if you are fortunate enough to have a portfolio, or any retirement savings at all.

5325 2018-01-05 17:05:43 Please, well respected newspaper. The stock market rise just benefits the wealthy? What about the teachers, pipe fitters, plumbers, electricians, and others, whose retirement accounts are invested in stocks and stock mutual funds? Do they not benefit from a rising stock market?
5326 2018-01-05 17:05:21 It is also worth noting that the top 10% own 81% of stocks...
5327 2018-01-05 17:05:04 yeah absolutely.  even centralized, if a bank can decrease the time and cost for sending money, customers are happy and willing to pay the same or more for advanced features.  My portfolio includes XRP but also all of the canadian bank stocks.  banks make money.
5328 2018-01-05 17:04:41 Your followers except the 1% don't own stocks or have 401k. Are you that dense.

5338 2018-01-05 17:01:15 Do plenty of research. Then start slow by adding what ever you can into your account($25). I suggest day trade, swing trade, or long term trade stocks. Set your goals low and put yourself in positions to profit more the you lose. $50 profit is a start untill your account grow.

5343 2018-01-05 16:59:29 @steverattner Now please do same comparison with unemployment over that date range.  You wont be pleased.  The Trump DJI rise is about optimism, company performance and re-investment.  The Obama DJI rise is about buying stocks at massive discounts due to crash.

5352 2018-01-05 16:56:48 Good luck prospering on stocks bud. There's 1 in 5 of you with anything in it. Besides, the economy is slowing. That's the trump effect.

5360 2018-01-05 16:54:21 I own a little gold for diversification, but am not really a huge fan. I prefer investing in stocks, businesses and education. Crypto is just a small portion of what I invest in.
5361 2018-01-05 16:54:20 That's our issue, we tell ourselves we can't so much that we believe it. Its all mental, change your mind and you will change your pockets. We broke but we can afford $160 shoes, $200 on makeup & hair. Put $600 worth of gold in our mouth, that $600 can into $2000 easily in stocks
5362 2018-01-05 16:53:42 The rise in the DOW has people who are in it elated, but how many of you  actually buy & sell stocks as a private citizen & not as a member of a 401k which you don't control?
5363 2018-01-05 16:53:38 Make investors great again! Mostly the top 1% own 40% of stocks held by households.

Ask Donny Boy how much is he making off the Chinese Stock market. I have been following the Chinese market and a lot of stocks in one day go up 500% Plus then three days later crap
5373 2018-01-05 16:50:21 Those at the bottom of the economic ladder, the one's with no 401K or stocks, must be just thrilled. Howz about doing something to keep social mobility alive, rather than building an aristocracy?
5374 2018-01-05 16:50:05 Now THIS, this could be v interesting... If true, sell stocks, go to cash for a few months. Fallout will be harsh.. temporarily.

5377 2018-01-05 16:48:42 Why is the jobs report so weak, weak, weak #ConManDon???  You must know many do not have stocks so the Dow means nothing to them.

5379 2018-01-05 16:48:08 @MeghanMcCain should know that the stock market is not the economy. Those ‘middle class’ Americans you claim to be ‘in touch with’ have no stocks and no 401ks.
5380 2018-01-05 16:47:38 @NJSnowFan  Thinking of you. My best advise - keep your mind & body totally occupied. Time does not heal quickly enough.  Mine was daughter, fitness, stocks, news & Twitter. Next...

They are bringing fund manager in who have very wealthy clients money to invest. $GVT platform is open up to stocks and commodities but bridges the gap for traditional investors
5383 2018-01-05 16:47:16 Easy come, easy go. Stocks looked pretty good in early 2007, too.

Plus, higher wages are a far more reliable source of wealth and would actually stimulate the economy. Stock market, meanwhile, is all perceptions and no economic growth.

5396 2018-01-05 16:43:17 A booming stock market is great! Well, for investors anyway.
Now if your main or only source of income is a medium or worse salary...
Hey, here's another thing: stocks often go up when companies cut expenses. You know, like workers and salaries.
5397 2018-01-05 16:43:11 Most everyone I know has a 401k with stocks.
5398 2018-01-05 16:43:10 Now I would join a Guru Elite trade club... I need to research trading futures and options as I only have been buying and holding stocks and Crypto, never dabbed in options or futures..

5401 2018-01-05 16:41:59 Certainly @realDonaldTrump deserves much of the credit for 
these five amazing headlines from today:

Fed Govt Cut 16,000 Jobs in '17

5404 2018-01-05 16:41:06 Again your tweet shows how unintelligent you really are. The DOW shows just how much the rich are getting richer. The rich companies are using their profits to buy more of their own stocks instead of giving wage increases to their workers.
5405 2018-01-05 16:41:01 Intel CEO sells most of his stocks just before the world became aware of chip flaws. How is this not insider trading and not punishable  #intelbug
5406 2018-01-05 16:40:28 Stocks soar, wages remain flat. Definitely good for you and your rich pals. Not so much for the rest of us.
5407 2018-01-05 16:40:19 Such a moron your are Trump, Half of the country cant afford to invest and the majority of stocks are owned by the wealthy top 8% so you just made your buddies rich not anyone that needs it.

5411 2018-01-05 16:39:17 I'm glad the stock market is doing well. I have a 401k and a stocks purchased on my own. BUT the dow being high does not immediately raise my wages or change my life. Only people who benefit are those whose income come from the stock market, or basically, rich folk who dont work.
5412 2018-01-05 16:39:07 This does nothing for most of your base. They don't own stocks you moron. Worse, you're once again claiming credit for #ThanksObama's SEVEN YEAR TREND. You don't even have a budget yet.

5417 2018-01-05 16:38:06 When I look at the stock market and see everything going up I gotta remind myself that the stocks that aren’t rising aren’t magically selling for a discount

5422 2018-01-05 16:37:03 Doubt the average wage earner, who doesn't own much, if any, in the way of stocks, has seen a 25% increase in salary. In other words, stock indices aren't the real economy, which you & sadly many of your followers obviously don't know.
5423 2018-01-05 16:36:58 53% of Americans own ZERO stocks including in retirement accounts. 5% of Americans own 82% of all individual stocks. So who do we think this “boom” helps?

5430 2018-01-05 16:34:59 I actually wait for a retracement also. Just seems to work better for me than pure breakout trading. Plenty of great stocks in solid new uptrends pulling back to solid demand areas, unless the original breakout was a false one.  If so, the stop saves us.

5450 2018-01-05 16:31:28 Today, the DOW is a benchmark that tracks American stocks that are considered to be the leaders of the economy and are on the Nasdaq and NYSE. The DOW covers 30 large-cap companies, which are subjectively picked by the editors of the Wall Street Journal.

5474 2018-01-05 16:27:10 Our economy is the result of Obama's slow and steady rescue of the Republican Recession and crash of 2008.  The stock market is up because of anticipation, great for those holding stocks, especially the top 5% of the USA.   What about the majority of USA holding little or none?
5475 2018-01-05 16:26:46 ..has been off-set by increased start stocks. Against this background it seems likely that local conditions and currency fluctuation will be the main factors influencing the UK market this season.”

5477 2018-01-05 16:26:21 The "boom" is lagging behind Obama Presidency trends. We all know that any money from cuts to taxes or regulations goes 95% (low-balling) into stocks, dividends, and foreign investments. Just look at the rising trade deficit.

5481 2018-01-05 16:25:43 And how many Americans own stocks? High stock prices are not an indicator of how well the country is doing as a whole, but how well corporations are doing. With you dropping corporate tax rates permanently, but citizen’s rates only temporarily, it makes sense that stocks rise.

5488 2018-01-05 16:23:12 And if a negative event happens today, tomorrow, whenever, it will plummet.  Events, not people affect the stock market.  The only folks who truly benefit are those with millions in stocks.  In other words the 1%
5489 2018-01-05 16:23:11 Wow, you literally don't know how the stock market works in a way that you think making stock owners wealthier somehow yields jobs.

Just like how tax cuts for the wealthy doesn't yield more jobs, your understanding of the economy and stocks are - to put it lightly - lacking.
5490 2018-01-05 16:23:09 @MeghanMcCain the average person you constantly refer doesn't own stock and could give a flying fuck about the dow. 80%of stocks are owned by the wealthy #TheView

5504 2018-01-05 16:20:05 too bad more than half of the working class own zero stocks. They don't make enough money to buy stocks.
5505 2018-01-05 16:19:43 If you don't have a 401K, a corporation or invest in stocks then the stock market does not benefit you!
5506 2018-01-05 16:19:40 What's a Dow Jones? 
The only stocks I'm familiar with are the ones I was locked in that one time for stealing sterno and tinned beans.
5507 2018-01-05 16:19:29 Cannabis Stocks
Bullish in Canada where corporate tax is weigh high comparative to neighbor USA. Probable reason looks that President attitude for.
5508 2018-01-05 16:19:25 I believe the article states that the fish stocks have declined due to illegal fishing activities in the Indian Ocean...hence the importance for countries to ratify to the #PSM agreement to deter such activities.
5509 2018-01-05 16:19:20 stocks in pot sector started plummeting Wednesday before the announcement. Hypothetical theory is that information was leaked from the DOJ to parties such as Kevin Sabet, who then began shorting stocks yesterday and continued today. contact your state attorney general's office
5510 2018-01-05 16:18:53 The rising stock market only benefits about 8% of Americans, Trump’s rich friends and alikes. 85% of stocks are owed by 10% of Americans.
5511 2018-01-05 16:18:50 A Psychatrist wrote RmTrump is unstable as others have as well. I can't understand backing a man who talks bad about your father and defends him. By the way 80 % of the stocks are bought by Millionaires not reg people@TheView
5512 2018-01-05 16:18:26 The Dow may continue to rise and sky rocket to unknown heights but does even 1 dollar go into the pocket of the poor and middle class to pay bills or feed their families? It all goes to the 1% who own 86% of the stocks and property
5513 2018-01-05 16:18:08 Wrong, just wait and see, hope you don’t have any kind of Stocks so you won’t benefit from the Stock Market going over 25,000, what ya say about that???

5515 2018-01-05 16:17:55 No but he does,has affected parts of it. Like Boeing favoritism. In the stock market,the Dow is not equally weighted-certain stocks have more worth than others. Take out the top 5 and we wouldn’t be at record levels.Those are Boeing, United Technology, 3M, Caterpillar, Home Depot

5518 2018-01-05 16:16:52 1986 National Firearms Act made it illegal and bump stocks are NOT needed or required to bump fire ANY type of semi auto firearm. Rifles, shotguns and pistols.....all can be 'bump fired' by hand only. Military style is select fire or full auto only weapons.

5521 2018-01-05 16:16:38 the secret of shorting is to short crappy conglomerates against sector indices and therefore you’re shorting frothy marijuana stocks...?
5522 2018-01-05 16:16:36 I have minimal knowledge about this, but my question is this, would this include money with an  investment firm that not technically invested in any stocks?
5523 2018-01-05 16:16:35 Everyone will just read the Financial Times in order to find out what stocks to buy
5524 2018-01-05 16:16:19 on the topic of stocks... they are just a more socially acceptable pyramid scheme.
5525 2018-01-05 16:16:08 I don’t buy stocks. But retail? Especially those.
5526 2018-01-05 16:15:53 #TreasonWeasel  What everyone already knew is now confirmed.  Your whole family are low-intellect, narcissistic, laughing stocks.
5527 2018-01-05 16:15:43 We’re more interested in the fact that you are a treasonous, unpatriotic, Russia colluding criminal. The stocks have been going up for years, now thanks to Obama.

5533 2018-01-05 16:15:05 Don't buy retail stocks. My investment advice for the day.
5534 2018-01-05 16:15:04 Everyday Trump talks about the Dow Jones (an average of only 30 stocks) as his major achievement, it amazes me how many people forget that our economy was on the brink of collapse in 2008.

President Obama saved this country from a depression!  Thank you Obama!
5535 2018-01-05 16:15:00 This is an average of 8 years to 1 and NO Obama hadn't had a year as good as trumps.  Trump might be worse after 4 or 8 years if we crash, until then 

Obama < Trump (for stocks)

5540 2018-01-05 16:14:16 Because Wall Street news doesn't matter to the majority of Americans. When will you expand your worldview so you can see MOST of us don't care about stocks, because they don't help us? And when the corporations are buying back stock with tax breaks instead of hiring. . . . ass
5541 2018-01-05 16:14:16 I have concerns that when you are no longer President the stock market will drop like a rock. And yes our family is in the percentage that have stocks bc my husband sacrificed and set aside a % of his income to provide for his family in retirement.
5542 2018-01-05 16:14:14 i can't stand when people post buy/sell recommendations by Barchart.  It literally means nothing because it's just a snapshot in time.  Pumper fodder.

5544 2018-01-05 16:14:12 @MeghanMcCain @TheView The reason MSM isn't talking about the Dow is that 75% of the country doesn't own stocks. That translates to viewers and readers.

5565 2018-01-05 16:11:01 stocks are pretty BS TBH, most of the "value" comes from speculation.

5576 2018-01-05 16:08:18 Cool idea.I generally don't like the stocks analogy, but this is a smart and useful adaptation.
5577 2018-01-05 16:08:07 Sure. The economy has been going up for the last few years. And now with trump reducing their costs, elimination government controls which protect us citizens, and increasing their profits mostly via the unfair tax law givaway to rich and corps, stocks are REALLY zooming.
5578 2018-01-05 16:08:04 16 months ago Trump was howling that the stock market was going to implode. He said he sold all his stocks. He's a dumb, lying putz.

5581 2018-01-05 16:07:41 We're not having an economic boom. Declaring booms on how the stock market is doing only accounts for how well people who can afford to trade stocks are doing. The job market is still as bleak as it was ten years ago. This is the bottom line indicator for the average American.

5603 2018-01-05 16:02:49 Since banks and large corporations use the newly printed money to buy homes and stocks, stock market rises and Home prices rise... causing cost of living to rise...

That’s the government printing money and the monetary policy (a gov policy).

This is not “capitalism” though. /2

5613 2018-01-05 16:01:14 No, I’d say the federal reserve constantly printing money is a big reason for income inequality. However the problem is certainly not a lack of theft (aka higher taxes).

Gov prints money, banks get the loans, Park money in assets such as housing and stocks...

5641 2018-01-05 15:56:18 ISIS crushed but dotard tweeted about Afghanistan allowing them to run rampant, and it's only been him and fox aka fauxnews reporting them crushed, neither believable. job/stocks --> thanks @BarackObama continued trends.
5642 2018-01-05 15:55:47 Part of what they're talking about are the intentional fake news, intentional bad advice, and leading ppl around in "pump groups"... all that directly predatory stuff that's screamingly illegal in stocks/currency isn't in crypto

5644 2018-01-05 15:55:35 Capitalism is purely voluntary. Solid companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft are not boom and bust stocks. Corrections yes but not going away. Yes, Big Short showed that pigs get slaughtered, they always have been.
5645 2018-01-05 15:55:34 Twitter is by far the most useful tool I use for stocks. I am not a trader but I do buy and sell frequently in my portfolio. I have a circle I follow and filter the rest. It has been crazy valuable to me.

5650 2018-01-05 15:54:35 That continue going to the wealthy since the top 10% own of 80% of stocks. Moron!
5651 2018-01-05 15:54:35 #Stocks gained on #jobs report, as the #market took headline miss and small acceleration in wage growth as dovish for #Fed. Though below expectations, 148k jobs added was still enough to keep #unemployment rate stable at 4.1%. The market still views bad news as good news.
5652 2018-01-05 15:54:19 grateful to have Amin to run errands with, especially when i have to carry 10kg of stocks, back and forth
5653 2018-01-05 15:54:14 Happy to help...

5655 2018-01-05 15:53:10 Well then his base needs to get better financial advisors. All the big financial advisors advised overweighting foreign stocks, which way outperformed the US markets.
5656 2018-01-05 15:53:09 In Trump’s first year, stocks soar for rich, but wages stay flat
5657 2018-01-05 15:53:01 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Strong manufacturing data gives US stocks another boost
5658 2018-01-05 15:52:51 There was a single, glorious news cycle in 2017 in which we were all led to believe bump stocks would be banned.
5659 2018-01-05 15:52:50 Pleasure is ours. The knowledge sharing was mutual and interestingly did not focus on just stocks.  There is life much beyond stocks.
5660 2018-01-05 15:52:37 Marijuana stocks are trying to recover today, but investors are still very nervous. Could take some time to undo yesterday's damage, courtesy of AG Jeff Sessions. We could even see another dip lower if he takes further action. #ImpeachSessions
5661 2018-01-05 15:52:18 Stocks goes up and down. What is your point?
5662 2018-01-05 15:51:27 80% of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10% of Americans. Only half of Americans own ANY stocks, and for many those are tied to retirement where they are at risk when your bubble bursts. Stock market gains measure profiteering by the wealthy; they aren't a popularity poll.
5663 2018-01-05 15:50:48 Jeff is an ass! Wonder what trump was smoking by bringing this clown in? Hey at least I call a spade a spade! Party be damned. Marijuana is the entire colorado economy & its a lavish place as a result. Prescrips/big pharm are down 30% here! Plus my pot stocks crashed!
5664 2018-01-05 15:50:46 Yes thank you! I see Billy Bob talking about stock market going up, dude, do you even own stocks? 401k? Anything? Probably not  but they assume since it sounds good it must be good for them
5665 2018-01-05 15:50:24 Half of U.S. don't own stocks. What about them ?  I know. You don't fucking care.
5666 2018-01-05 15:50:23 No I was on possible watch for a character change in the stocks. Not saying they're sells at all -- I'm not that short-term -- but something to notice with the market ramping.
5667 2018-01-05 15:50:22 That's why the game is so great!!! It's so explosive and volatile in today's meta, so exciting! I swear nothing satisfies people. A year ago everyone was complaining about how campy the game was getting and now stocks are going too quickly??
5668 2018-01-05 15:49:46 But, when you've paid attention over decades to booming stock markets & good things happening for working people, there's no correlation. In Reagan year,s stocks went up when workers laid off b/c that increased profits for stockholders. Doubt that's changed.
5669 2018-01-05 15:49:16 While all y’all were sleeping on my boy @realDonaldTrump during the election; I made a bunch of Trump buttons, sold them, and invested in stocks.... #ILoveCapitalism
5670 2018-01-05 15:49:12 Day 4: I have signed up for #HargreavesLansdown and got my login details so i can start investing. They are slightly pricey but i can trade overseas stocks so this should be fun.
5671 2018-01-05 15:49:08 Unimpressive: “Stocks have gone up.”

Really impressive: “The risk sentiment is absolutely soaring.”
5672 2018-01-05 15:48:50 Knowing when to buy and sell stocks is important, but nerve wrecking.
5673 2018-01-05 15:48:46 How’re your stocks performing.
5674 2018-01-05 15:48:29 First of all, less than half the country owns stocks so this means nothing to a lot of people. Second, this would be happening no matter who was president. You should ask someone how this works.
5675 2018-01-05 15:48:03 From lithium to marijuana to btc related stocks, over past year or 2 the naïve newbie investors learn quite a few lessons of greed, fear, market volatility, know your risk tolerance, your trading strategy, your market thesis, you learn pretty quickly when $$ gained, lost fast.
5676 2018-01-05 15:46:16 Most Americans are invested in the stock market through their IRAs.  They're not actively buying and selling stocks.  Without taking these into consideration, I bet that much less than 50% of Americans invest in stocks.  We can't afford it.
5677 2018-01-05 15:46:10 phixos, order your lightsticks as soon as possible while there are still alot of stocks because we all know that it gets sold out when the concert tour starts.

5680 2018-01-05 15:45:06 The stock market is great if you own stocks! You know this ... Right?
5681 2018-01-05 15:44:44 Company stocks are overvalued. I’m waiting for the “correction.”
5682 2018-01-05 15:44:29 Possible next poll for consideration @SquawkStreet Savings vs. Stocks ratio (Tortoise v. Hare). Friend just told me he's 5% former 95% latter for available money. #dangerzone @carlquintanilla @MelissaLeeCNBC @michaelsantoli
5683 2018-01-05 15:44:27 Would be nice if Americans could actually afford to buy stocks.  Since MOST of us can't this doesn't really matter

5686 2018-01-05 15:44:04 No better time to be in the stock market than now. Can practically throw a dart at board of stocks, invest in it and make money.
5687 2018-01-05 15:43:52 Also, notice how he is taking FULL credit for things like unemployment levels, stock market & airplanes not crashing, all of which have MULTIPLE factors on their rise & fall.
He better be careful taking so much credit for stocks, because they will crash

5690 2018-01-05 15:43:24 Stocks, are also how companies pay matching 401s, Retirements and decide on pay increases or bonuses, so bottom line, stock market affects all of us one way or the other.

5698 2018-01-05 15:41:16 I think the stock market rally has been so hated is that so many people have missed it. Only 54% of Americans have investments in stocks compared to 62% before the 2008 crash. $SPY

5701 2018-01-05 15:41:02 @realDonaldTrump Job growth is spiraling down. Cost of gas rapidly rising. Sears, other retailers closing stores by the hundreds.

5714 2018-01-05 15:38:41 Great news! The rich are getting richer! 

50% of all Americans have a 401k and own stocks. The rest of us? Not so great. 

100% of Americans have an alleged criminal for POTUS. Not so great.

But who cares? Pat yourself on your back....
5715 2018-01-05 15:38:27 Do you know the percentage of population who own stocks? Only about 40%! Don't equate stock market going up with economic growth. The Stock market performance is based mainly on speculation.
5716 2018-01-05 15:38:15 Not that many people can afford to try to play the stock market. We really don't care about stocks. We want food and shelter. We want a fair wage for a day's work. You are out of touch!

5718 2018-01-05 15:37:51 Not only is it not the Economy, the Dow isn’t even ALL Stocks. Further, much of that gain is attributable to ONE stock, Boeing.

5734 2018-01-05 15:35:13 INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE SENATE is now possible due to the very high and probably insider trading going on into the oil industry via Trump's slip the data many time out before actually making it official causing many to buy stocks BEFORE they make them rise.

5738 2018-01-05 15:33:56 Most Americans do not own stocks and many do not have retirement savings. A booming stock market means little to a majority of the working and middle class.

5775 2018-01-05 15:26:03 Looking forward to joining my friend @trish_regan on her @FoxBusiness show at 2pm today talking stocks historic & record breaking run, jobs report & more. Who deserves credit? Does it matter?
5776 2018-01-05 15:25:58 fact @realDonaldTrump keeps spouting off rises in market, makes it plain, he has 0 no idea what life outside  billionaire or millionaire bubble is. Some will benifit from  stocks but when compared to how the 10% make out, it's merely pennies. So income equality will keep rising
5777 2018-01-05 15:25:34 You're forgetting "the forgotten men and women" again.
Over 50% of the country does not have two nickels to rub together let alone own stocks. Sad!

5782 2018-01-05 15:23:39 Every time @realDonaldTrump tweets about the stock market, remember that 50% of Americans aren't invested in the market (and 80% of all stocks are owned by the richest 10%).

Our national problem isn't insufficient wealth: It's immoral distribution.

5792 2018-01-05 15:22:15 No, many millions in the American work force have 401k plans, and most of them include stocks.  So the value of retirement funds goes up.
5793 2018-01-05 15:22:14 "...the richest 10% own 84% of stocks." -- Good. Then they'll be the ones taking the losses when the bubble bursts.

5798 2018-01-05 15:21:10 Buying stocks can send you on an emotional roller coaster.  Bought something at $10.47 and it dropped to $10.20 almost immediately.  A few minutes later it’s at $10.86 and all is right in the world unless it drops again.

The Dow measures only the top 30 Industrial stocks.  The S&P measures 500 stocks.  Learn!

5817 2018-01-05 15:17:27 Some perspective:  It's great that the Dow keeps hitting new records. But remember, the richest 10% own 84% of stocks.

Meanwhile, wages for the average worker have risen 2.5% the past 12 months, while the consumer price index is up 2.2%. Just a 0.3% gain.
5818 2018-01-05 15:17:14 That would be nice if I could afford to buy stocks. I'm sure you've have made a killing on top of that 14% you stole from the working people...
5819 2018-01-05 15:17:05 Someone should actually explain this to the dumpster Trumpsters who keep tweeting about how the dotard is making the Stock Market so great again because I think they think that they actually own stocks in the stock market.  Either that or they really r just stupid

5822 2018-01-05 15:15:36 NOT, ITS SMPLY THAT US CORPORATIONS HAVE TO KEEP BUYING BACK THEIR OWN STOCK, BECAUSE EUROPE AND ASIA ARE SELLING BILLIONS OFF AND CHINA ALONG IN THE TRILLIONS, SO INSTEAD OF SEEING A SELLOUT OF THEIR STOCKS THEY ARE HAVING TO PURCHASE THEIR OWN STOCKS! WHAT A RACKET OF LIES!

5826 2018-01-05 15:15:06 The stock market is not the economy. The top 10% in this country own 80% of the stocks.
5827 2018-01-05 15:14:46 Too bad a good portion of your #MAGA base don’t own stocks.
5828 2018-01-05 15:14:39 10 years removed from the biggest market sell off in seven decades, large cap stocks averaged 9% a year, small cap stocks 10% a year—including the decline!

I’m sure there’s better anicdotal evidence about the benefits of staying the course, but this one ain’t bad...
5829 2018-01-05 15:14:31 I agree someone should post a survey on how many middle class people own stocks
5830 2018-01-05 15:14:26 Yup fraid so
Was my first purchase in AIM stocks too .
It hasn't been enjoyable.
The shareholders should stop him spinning zulu off and make him come to them to raise shares in issue when he wants money.
Keep zulu with the people that paid for it .his mates will have pay us
5831 2018-01-05 15:14:17 No root beer?  Quark stocks it.
5832 2018-01-05 15:14:12 That’s because most middle and lower income people dont own stocks in the stock market. More wealth for the wealthy- not helping the rest of us.
5833 2018-01-05 15:14:09 Just think, @CNN was adamant that stocks would crash if you were elected.  CNN is #FakeNews of epic proportions.

5836 2018-01-05 15:13:47 The news was timed when the stocks were over bought when the stocks are oversold still announced positive news and these things will blast off taking their next leg up the news is dictated by the technicals not the other way around
5837 2018-01-05 15:13:34 I just finance my home early 2017, after divorce, I will lose all that hard work I've busted my backside to keep a roof over my kid's head. Folks partying over the rising stocks, don't realize,  stocks don't bring jobs, majority of Americans aren't invested.
5838 2018-01-05 15:13:25 Less than 50% of Americans own stocks. This only helps the rich. The unemployment rate still sucks. Nice try on spin, though. Try again.
5839 2018-01-05 15:13:01 stock trends is based on investment dollars concentrated in momentum stocks. valuation is based on investment dollars and momentum and  fundamentals play smaller part. 4 example Amazon is a high flier but return on investment is low compared to high flier Alphabet.

5841 2018-01-05 15:12:34 My advice to young investors..become a master in 2/3 stocks..instead of 50.

Know more about your 2/3 cos than anyone else on d-street. 

Remember..u just need 1 "nanocap to midcap" to change your life..and the lives of ur future generations.

5842 2018-01-05 15:12:33 Yep! They don’t care that Little man Sessions screwed a lot of people trying to make a little extra money in pot stocks
5843 2018-01-05 15:12:31 Soooo, I have a lot of money invested in stocks, and this new tax bill benefits people who have stocks. Now I hate EVERYTHING Trump stands, BUT FUCK! The DOW is up 25,000 cause of it and I’m making bank right now for doing nothing....
5844 2018-01-05 15:12:13 How’s her stocks look ? Why isn’t she complaining about how Governor Jerry Brown has screwed the state up.
5845 2018-01-05 15:12:00 If it’s one thingI want different for myself this year is to save a lot more money invest into stocks and have a sky high credit score and best know that’s a guarantee resolution
5846 2018-01-05 15:11:50 what that does to profit margins...yet stocks keep soaring.
5847 2018-01-05 15:11:37 Can someone pleass tell me what is making these china stocks pop to levels above 100% gain??? $CPHI
5848 2018-01-05 15:11:15 Seems most pot stocks are either down slightly or up slightly now. Only a few still seeing major losses. People starting to calm down?

5855 2018-01-05 15:10:00 My friends treat trading in crypto like forex and stocks as if the latters will give you, of what I will say, galactic gains and loss in just a few hours. Crypto exchange is a highly volatile market and the secret is to hold your coin until you make profit.
5856 2018-01-05 15:09:20 What jobs? ? Macy's is cutting 5000 employees and 700 stores Walmart is cutting employees as they are self service and you have Comcast that just cut over 1000 employees since getting your Christmas tax gift. How is this about jobs sir?? Stocks go up because people buy them
5857 2018-01-05 15:09:15 Because mostly the rich own stocks. This doesn’t help average people. Sad.
5858 2018-01-05 15:09:14 The takeaway here is, but stocks and join the party.

5862 2018-01-05 15:08:19 The stock market is not our economy. It's the rich man's land. Macy's, AT&T, & several other companies are laying workers off. If people don't have jobs, they don't buy stuff therefore eventually the stocks will go down. We are the economy.

5868 2018-01-05 15:06:39 You do understand that by taking less taxed from your money = less Gov. 

Deregulation by trump = less Gov.

Stocks are soaring because of deregulation = less Gov. In biz.

5870 2018-01-05 15:06:16 GREAT if you have stocks, but the average Joe has not seen any improvement in their pay or their general well-being.
5871 2018-01-05 15:05:34 And yet...most big corps already paid way below 20% and haven’t moved wages. So relying on Resident Plump’s “big move” won’t help much, especially when that bridge you’re driving over on your way to work crumbles to the ground. How are your stocks doing, Brian?
5872 2018-01-05 15:05:26 And since 80% of Americans don't own stocks, 80% of Americans don't give a shit. It's your rich buddies and big corporations that care. You know, the only ones YOU care about.
5873 2018-01-05 15:05:16 noooooo  the rich are simply getting richer most Americans don't own stocks they can't afford them... so the rich keep getting richer....
5874 2018-01-05 15:04:56 You've created the least amount of jobs in the past four years... it's a documented fact! Also this stock market boom only helps those who already own stocks. 80% of Americans don't. Just the rich getting richer #SAD #LiarLiar #AlternativeFacts
5875 2018-01-05 15:04:49 Only positive thing you can point to. You're obsessed with it. But weak orrelation. A) Stocks only tangentally related to government/policies; B) Only tangentally related to economy; C) May actually indicate weakness in overall economy. C) Stocks rallied before Great Depression.
5876 2018-01-05 15:04:48 Stupid shit like this is what might keep Dems from retaking Congress and the White House! Seriously, all they have to do is point out that Trump hooked his wagon to Wall Street and screwed the working class and they got both EASY! So much ammo with Trump's cheerleading of stocks!

5885 2018-01-05 15:03:09 Yeas the drop was his fault.  When you cut 5 military bases and military spending in your first 3 week in war time.  Businessmen want no part in trade with you which drops stocks.  Just look at Clinton's
5886 2018-01-05 15:03:04 When you give billionaires massive tax breaks, the stocks rise making billionaires into trillionnaires. But the poor still suffer.
5887 2018-01-05 15:03:01 Asking any brave Democrat to break the narrative, take the high road- or one far less traveled— if you get a tax cut- if you get a tax refund-if your stocks moved in the right direction for the first time in a few years-will you admit it?  ?????
5888 2018-01-05 15:02:55 While stocks last Scott! Check with your barista to see if they have any left!
5889 2018-01-05 15:02:45 And yet you managed to make more sense to me in 3 tweets than my advisor has in 18 years of actual talking.  You effectively talked me off the ledge.  And then I copy/pasted what you said to my family so they think I know things now. You are the Cyrano de Bergerac of stocks.

5896 2018-01-05 15:02:24 Hey AssFuck. The DOW literally means nothing to the majority of the American people who are not invested in stocks. You are stupid. This is not "winning". The only shiny object here is your Pomade gel.
5897 2018-01-05 15:02:12 The DOW closed at a new high again, 25,000.  All markets are up since the election.  Those in 401k, IRA, stocks, have all done well this last year. I you don't have those investments I guess you will be retiring on SS only.

5906 2018-01-05 14:59:48 I know you are joking but there is a MASSIVE difference between picking individual stocks and fucking around with pharma penny stocks
5907 2018-01-05 14:59:38 Corporations are buying stocks ..the market is going to crash and you know it ...
5908 2018-01-05 14:59:34 Come on Chris this is why you are called fake news, you put of a statistical fact but then you throw in “Wall Street vs Main Street”. You know most Americans retirement plans are tired to stocks and corporations success. Retirement rolling now!!!  Wall street is Main Street.
5909 2018-01-05 14:59:10 Right.. smart investing isn’t 100% into non-volatile stocks. It’s a mix of short term and long term gains at different risks
5910 2018-01-05 14:59:09 Technically, for no one. Those trillions are worth $0 until those stocks are sold. And what happens when people sell stock en masse? A crash.

5913 2018-01-05 14:57:47 Ouais pareil c'est ce que je comptais faire aussi mais j'espère qu'ils vont suivre au niveau des stocks au moins merci pour ta réponse
5914 2018-01-05 14:57:37 Fuck #WallStreet. Majority of stocks are owned by the 1% so @realDonaldTrump stop taking responsibility for it you #douche. #Trump #Moron #MentalPatient
5915 2018-01-05 14:57:23 Many millions own stocks directly and millions more do indirectly via 401k plans through their jobs. Market increases do affect everybody positively even if you're not among those that own stocks or have 401k plans.
5916 2018-01-05 14:56:58 No it wouldn't be. In your world, the stock market is god. To most average people, who have no stocks, it's meaningless. It's not a big story to any but the wealthy. You're outta touch don.
5917 2018-01-05 14:56:49 Robert W. Baird raised the price target on USG Corporation (NYSE: USG) from $35 to $45. USG shares closed at $38.43 on Thursday.   #stockstobuy #stocks #invest #investing #investment #money #TradingStrategy

5923 2018-01-05 14:56:01 thank you.  You probably got pushback from people who own private prison stocks.  Check out how invested some of our politicians are.  private prisons should be outlawed.
5924 2018-01-05 14:55:35 First, it went up more under Obama, but second, and more importantly, ~45% of the country even has stocks, and most of those don't have 'significant' investments to warrant much care about arbitrary numbers. Given the practices of stock buy backs, it's artificial to boot.
5925 2018-01-05 14:54:48 Even the nra bans bump stocks from their shooting range

5928 2018-01-05 14:54:11 Players in the draft are like stocks.

You have your evaluation of them and your grade.

But ultimately you have to decide how much you want to give up to get them.

That market valuation may not directly match your evaluation (see QB market).
5929 2018-01-05 14:54:11 Marijuana stocks still down today. Not too late to catch the boat. Got my eye on a CO-based company, hoping it'll drop some more
5930 2018-01-05 14:53:44 Without a single facelift, I have no idea about the SA canal stocks. But I hold to my point: the BS cult of brilliant and reclusive mathematicians has inflated a bubble around what was (and should be) a very marginal asset. Only carbon exchanges rival crypto in absurdity.
5931 2018-01-05 14:53:37 I don’t care. Keep the stocks and 401k’s rising and taxes falling. End Daca and start term limits. If the Wall gets built it’s a bonus.

5933 2018-01-05 14:53:21 Yeah that's great for the top 10% that own 80% of the stocks oh and don't forget the people from other countries that own so much American stock. Bet they are happy too. But the middle class and working class pfffft

5942 2018-01-05 14:52:16 $CREG had an entry w/ 2000 share avg 3.45 and ended up cutting loss on it when it pulled to 3.30's and all the other chinese stocks were looking weak.. this came back
5943 2018-01-05 14:51:42 He does have stocks. At least he used to pet him talking about it on the Stern show. For 16 years he bitched about Bush for his stocks and once Barry is out he thinks it was him that made it all go up.

Stocks- most middle class Americans don't have. Mostly the rich.
You are so full of crap
5949 2018-01-05 14:50:36 @realDonaldTrump WHEN STOCKS GO UP LIKE A ROCKET,THEY MAY COME DOWN LIKE A ROCKET.BULL MARKET IS 9 YEARS OLD. AFTER CRASHING IN EARLY 2009, STOCKS WENT FROM 8000 TO 18000 UNDER OBAMA. MARKET COULD SOON BE OVERSOLD & CRASH.Only question is when. Small investors may be hurt badly.
5950 2018-01-05 14:50:06 est-ce que tu sais combien la fnac prévoit d'albums pour ses stocks ? j'espère qu'ils en auront pas genre 10 comme c'est apparemment le cas ailleurs
5951 2018-01-05 14:50:05 Yeah, definitely don't want to buy cheap stocks.
5952 2018-01-05 14:49:53 All these China stocks are just blowing up
5953 2018-01-05 14:49:38 @realDonaldTrump #POTUS Please stop crashing my stock portfolio! Have your financial gurus do some DD on how much $$$ the "pot stocks" lost yesterday & today due 2 Jeff Sessions, for the 2nd time in a year. See Feb 23rd, 2017.  #MAGA #Legalize #Legislate #Regulate #Tax Marijuana
5954 2018-01-05 14:49:34 i feels, but just saying.. don't gave to be super rich to make some gains off stocks
5955 2018-01-05 14:49:20 $BTC up again? It was at 15k yesterday and now over 16k. Maybe what they said about 20k is true? #NYSE #stocks #Stockstowatch #NASDAQ
5956 2018-01-05 14:49:14 @iCryptoHuMan I invest in stocks as well and many crypto/Blockchain related companies based in Canada - HIVE Blockchain for one. You guys are leading the way.
5957 2018-01-05 14:48:59 Buy stocks that only go up.

Wish I thought of that.
Eff... me
5958 2018-01-05 14:48:19 i wouldn’t short these china stocks if I had monopoly money. notorious for massive squeezes
5959 2018-01-05 14:48:11 Making an entire watch list of small cap oil right now.  Oil stocks will explode in coming weeks IMO
5960 2018-01-05 14:47:54 $AMCN 
5961 2018-01-05 14:47:38 I agree which is why being 50 we are looking to move our higher risk stocks to safer options. We can not afford to take the hit we did 9 years ago.
5962 2018-01-05 14:47:30 The DOW is not the Economy and the Economy is not the DOW. The DOW is up because corporations buy back their own stocks, that's hardly growth!
5963 2018-01-05 14:47:23 Within the first 12 hours of its launch Penny Henny was used by investors over 1,000 times to search for penny stocks that jump 50% or more. Download it on the App Store today.
5964 2018-01-05 14:47:04 Obama did set stock market records, which is why YOU are able to. When it’s at a record high, as it was under Obama, any increase, large or small, will set another record. Fact is, stocks went up faster under Obama, but YOU denied it.
5965 2018-01-05 14:47:00 Had no trades the past 2 days, probably saved me from the China stocks $CNET $CNIT $CCIH
5966 2018-01-05 14:46:57 @SRuhle just spent 7 minutes on the Dow. Yet another lie from trump that no news channel talks about stocks.
5967 2018-01-05 14:46:36 But Sir, Trumpcare premiums have already spiked 30%. Most of us don't own stocks that don't reflect our own lives! Help middle-class and seniors and the poor!
5968 2018-01-05 14:46:26 Penny stock geeks sayin wmac can hit 6$ like intv...i m in u was on this early
5969 2018-01-05 14:46:22 What about the other 50% who employers do not offer 401k. That can't afford to donate to a retirement fund or own any stocks.

This portion of the population is the lower middle class & the poor

How does this help them?
5970 2018-01-05 14:46:21 If the cannabis stocks opened up, I would be worried.  That doesn't mean they reverse higher today but it's one more conditional element in place.   

Again, I'm buying U.S names in this crush lower and will patiently wait thru the political theater.  All day.
5971 2018-01-05 14:46:15 Stocks are for rich people. Doesn't affect half the population.

5973 2018-01-05 14:46:02 This is most significant indicator of a correction in stocks but again there is a regime change after 2013. I doubt old analysis holds any longer, example is Dow theory failing multiple times.
5974 2018-01-05 14:45:53 If you are not active military and 'in country' , you don't need these weapons, and bump stocks are useless dangerous toys with no military utilization. Period. USMC forever
5975 2018-01-05 14:45:51 Great post. people are still chasing MJ stocks, but correction is happening. Once $fat releases some news, we're off again, and this time we stay above $1. JV news and updated N43-101 will be catalyst for off-take agreement, which is already in talks. IMO.
5976 2018-01-05 14:45:47 @SRuhle HERE YOU GO AGAIN TALKING ABOTU STOCKS WHICH THE MAJORITY OF AMERICA DOESNT HAVE STOCKS... THE ECONOMY WAS BETTER SINCE OBAMA  WAS IN... TRUMP IS KILLING OUR COUNTRY AND TAKING AWAY OF SAFTY  FOR GOOD NUMBERS... IT IS SICKENING STOP PRAISING  THIS CLOWN
5977 2018-01-05 14:45:32 No it jumped because of all the extra money the rich will get from your tax deal.   They will spend on stocks not the workers.
5978 2018-01-05 14:45:13 These over 50s policies that they're pushing hard on the telly are a serious con, aren't they. You'd get comparable terms with a standing order into an ISA. It seems just a mechanism to raise capital, presumably for the companies to trade on stocks
5979 2018-01-05 14:44:50 Can't argue with his style.
Buys only stocks that go up and continues to do so.

Note : According to him
5980 2018-01-05 14:44:48 Nice trades to be made on multiple POT stocks bouncing

5983 2018-01-05 14:44:14 This is what I love about Twitter. Brain dead nobody's can have their 15 minutes of infamy without having to leave the house (or check facts). They are then placed in 'cyber-stocks' being pelted with virtual rotten fruit! Priceless.
5984 2018-01-05 14:44:02 CNCB is a culprit in this by bringing on guests who tofu stocks to the moon. Do everyone a favor & host a panel of honest analysis on the other narrative. There are great analysts who could do this CNBC seems destined to obliterate people by a stupid narrative.

5988 2018-01-05 14:43:26 Everything is so distorted that cryptos make stocks feel like theyre the safe stable part of a portfolio and actual safe investments like bonds and cash seem like a waste of time
5989 2018-01-05 14:43:12 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your depression
5990 2018-01-05 14:43:12 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses

5996 2018-01-05 14:42:38 Most of the job growth in recent months is due to hurricane/ wildfire rebuilding! AT&T lays of, Macy’s lays off, carrier lays off. Tax brakes have created No jobs! Will not create jobs, but will buy back stocks for owners etc. Thieving on a grand scale.
5997 2018-01-05 14:42:34 Stocks were already going up, ISIS is still not crushed, job creation in 2017 less than previous years, NK agreed to talk because they never wanted war. But have you read this new book though?
5998 2018-01-05 14:42:34 *stocks*
5999 2018-01-05 14:42:31 STOCKS SET NEW RECORDS...
6000 2018-01-05 14:42:29 He built on Obama's success. Obama took office in Jan 09 with unemployment 7.8 & left office with Dec 17 rate 4.1; Stocks 7949.09 09 inauguration day 19,780.20 day Trump innaug. That's 249% increase in market. Business gets big tax cut of course market goes high. #Facts
6001 2018-01-05 14:42:04 Why should most of us care? We don’t own stocks.

6003 2018-01-05 14:41:36 So what? 50% of Americans don’t own stock. You’re reporting this to the rich, who own 80% of all stocks?
6004 2018-01-05 14:41:33 HOLY SH*T these china stocks man
6005 2018-01-05 14:41:32 Try watching something other than Fox. Everyone knows. Unfortunately, more than 50% of Americans own no stocks. They're trying to feed their families on less than $15 an hour.
6006 2018-01-05 14:41:04 Why don't you quit? Beat them to it, take control & go out on high note of decent jobs, stocks high & tax reform. Ride out into the sunset on those 3 things and use it as your moniker for your next reality show. I'm fairly confident there won't be many more high notes in 2018.
6007 2018-01-05 14:40:57 Dow up over 30%, Nasdaq up over 30 percent, S&P up over 30 percent, Russ2k up over 30 percent...@paulkrugman I thought Dt winning was going to cause the markets to crash?

6008 2018-01-05 14:40:49 Watching chinese stocks, got some profit today to get over yesterdays loss, careful not all are parabolic, after the opening madness, $CNET will be on watch see if it runs more

6010 2018-01-05 14:40:36 Thoughts about mj stocks:
1. Sessions memo will not be fatal but will take a bit to work out.
2. Big winners in MJ will emerge in both cultivation/distribution and pharma.
3. 95% of today's pretender stocks will implode.  $CANN $CBDS $BUDZ etc will not be among winners.

6012 2018-01-05 14:40:21 When do U sell stocks?

a) Sell when a stock doubles or goes up X% from the buying cost

b) Whenever a stock investment doubles, then sell stocks equal to the initial investment. 

But aren't you missing out on capitalizing on your researched investments.

Patience is the key!!
6013 2018-01-05 14:40:19 Have you invested in more stocks?
6014 2018-01-05 14:39:50 Also very cold weather will dampen the economy just a tad to keep the Fed away. We also think we will see very good earnings numbers for q4. All sectors with positive earnings.  #stocks
6015 2018-01-05 14:39:25 Yesssssssss......... actually you have your pick going long on any of the china stocks today if you are good at quick entries and exits.

6020 2018-01-05 14:38:03 Ridiculous.  Plenty of 401k have stocks in the market.
6021 2018-01-05 14:37:23 not surprising considering '45' owns 25% im stocks of standard oil or so and 10% of another oil company.
6022 2018-01-05 14:37:09 US stocks headed higher after jobs report S&P 500 climbs again
It's been a great first week to the year for stocks.
Today's jobs report was strong enough to keep optimism about the economic high but weak enough to keep fears of Fed hikes in check.
6023 2018-01-05 14:37:03 @SRuhle People don't buy stocks when the price is up. Like now.
6024 2018-01-05 14:37:01 Stocks mostly higher again as the 4th trading day brings more gains so far. Light employment numbers takes pressure off rates for now. Earnings to come and looking good. Home Depot continues to rise $hd
6025 2018-01-05 14:36:53 Nigerian #Stocks rally continues with strong breadth despite poor #Unemployment figure! What a Big Disconnect. A divergence sort of.
6026 2018-01-05 14:36:29 when it comes to economic growth: the Fed. The U.S. central bank in recent months has warned about inflated market values. Should stocks continue to run wild, there's a very real threat that the Fed could turn out the lights on Trump's market party.

6037 2018-01-05 14:35:14 And what happens then the bubble bursts again? Most people in the financial business are saying this too much too fast is a sign of another bubble bursting eventually. Also, can we get some context here - way more than half of Americans DO NOT have $ in stocks/IRA or 401k!
6038 2018-01-05 14:35:09 I live on shitty LI which is a blue run state run into the ground by giveaway programs.  I get screwed on SALT taxes.  I dont own stocks either.  But I am happy if my country does better & many people have more take home pay and more jobs are created. Obama did NOTHING.
6039 2018-01-05 14:34:58 90% of all stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10%.  At the risk of repeating myself:  CHRIST, YOU ARE DUMB!
6040 2018-01-05 14:34:49 I believe the pot stocks will be in the red for the morning but i see a stronger finish today and maybe down 5%

6045 2018-01-05 14:33:34 Bull shit again Dean
"Where is the well regulated militia"
Madison had no idea about any firearms that were not muzzle loaded spears.
Automatic weapons used to harm school children, concert goers, work place 
Would have appalled him
Regulate military 7.62 ammo
 Ban bump stocks
6046 2018-01-05 14:33:31 You’re life is a train wreck. Why talk about stocks being at an all time high when we can talk about you and Bannon and how Bannon has yet to testify before Congress. So Juicy

6048 2018-01-05 14:33:14 Your better off talking about tax policy and hopes for faster growth, and to stop talking about the Dow. Markets go up and markets go down, and using stocks as a barometer for broader economic performance has proven through history to be a dicey endeavor.
6049 2018-01-05 14:33:04 yeah well that sems to be one of the two measures TRUMP uses  stocks and tv ratings  that's how he measures himself as a man    sad
6050 2018-01-05 14:33:04 Wow. Stocks going up make companies more valuable. Employees often have stock options, too. Plus, higher valued companies usually have more revenue and create more jobs. More jobs means more tax dollars. Come on, man.
6051 2018-01-05 14:32:56 Nearly $1 trillion has been pulled from retail-investor mutual funds that target U.S. stocks since the start of 2012
6052 2018-01-05 14:32:23 So Don. ..you counting your pennies?..most Americans don't own stocks and shares....

6056 2018-01-05 14:32:04 We all know about it and we understand you aren't responsible for it. The stock market doesn't change most Americans lives. We don't get raises when stocks go up yet we pay more each week for groceries, gas, cloths, insurance, etc. 25,000 means nothing to those who struggle daily

6058 2018-01-05 14:31:57 Everybody wants to profit from decreasing corporate taxes. That's why demand for stocks and therefore stock price rises. Has nothing to do with value creation. I'd rather call it 'stock inflation'.

6061 2018-01-05 14:30:19 @PeterLBrandt hi Peter do you do analysis on #euro stocks ? Thanks
6062 2018-01-05 14:30:17 When the #bitcoin bubble pops, there will be a correction.  #WallStreet will recover post bitcoin, cash out before the SEC steps in.  #magfest2018 #MAGA. #Pot #Stocks crashed after Sessions rolled back Obama era regs, but they will return big post Sessions.  #Speculation #Opinion
6063 2018-01-05 14:29:28 Hey dipstick, the top 1% of the wealthiest people own around 80% of the market so if course it's going to go up. We're not as stupid as you. Whilst stocks are going up the middle class and poor are becoming worse off, but as long as your profiting from it then who cares right?
6064 2018-01-05 14:29:22 gold's stocks to flows
6065 2018-01-05 14:29:19 I'm really Finna start investing in stocks
6066 2018-01-05 14:29:17 Uh...have you forgotten that most of the “forgotten” people don’t own stocks, or are you just counting on them forgetting that?
6067 2018-01-05 14:29:17 Looks like Insider Trading, wonder how many tech leaders sold their stocks before public disclosure
6068 2018-01-05 14:29:08 $XBT up about 7% watch for Bitcoin stocks to follow shortly
6069 2018-01-05 14:29:02 why does you liking/respecting them have anything to do with their abilities to pick stocks?
6070 2018-01-05 14:28:53 I'm working on my stocks. Making so much money trying to figure out what to do next. I'M loving how much we are WINNING. Thank u PRESIDENT TRUMP.
6071 2018-01-05 14:28:50 Surprise you just gave them a ton of money to buy back their stocks..increasing the cost of said stocks.
6072 2018-01-05 14:28:30 Not sure what Roy Orbison has to do with stocks? 
6073 2018-01-05 14:28:07 I was just researching what medical marijuana stocks to invest in and Sessions goes and does what he does 
6074 2018-01-05 14:27:53 I was actually 'forecasting' crude stocks for the week, no payrolls, no one has realised yet :)
6075 2018-01-05 14:27:42 $CNIT $CNET $HTGM $CPHI $CCIH are on my watchlist this morning. Also watching marijuana stocks to bounce after being beaten down.
6076 2018-01-05 14:26:56 Charlatans need growth narratives to justify charging their clients with crushing fees for their useless "work".
Hence the love of bubbly stocks that provide the basis for said narratives

6078 2018-01-05 14:26:48 Non Farm Payrolls showed a gain of 148,000 jobs in December 2017. It was slightly weaker than expected, maybe a start to a trend confirmed by yield weakness? Market ignoring it thus far with euphoric rush to stocks. #Jobs #NonFarmPayroll #Unemployment #StockMarket #economy
6079 2018-01-05 14:26:46 I think that's why stocks are so high. When you don't have to pay your labor shit the money goes to the owners.
6080 2018-01-05 14:26:41 Your idiot base has no stocks or if they do, they owe way more in debt than their 401K is worth. They are either too stupid or too blind & loyal to realize it. Some live at home with mom or the adult kids live with them. That’s reality. You & your “swamp” don’t live in it.
6081 2018-01-05 14:26:28 + Dow is 30 companies. Meaningless. Importantly, US stock indices underperformed global stocks last year. Only UK lagged US.

6083 2018-01-05 14:24:55 A hope you’s are ready for a war this weekend, let’s get into them purple cuntssss #Coyf @C_Schaber @elcreido18 @Stocks_68 @nucci39
6084 2018-01-05 14:24:55 And the DOW doesn’t reflect the economy anymore than the stock market overall when all the stocks are wildly overvalued as they are today. Lots of froth build on crumbling wafers not solid structure.
6085 2018-01-05 14:24:54 where did all the millions they made in fees go? I bought and sold two bitcoins several years ago through coinbase and it was like trading the shittiest illiquid trash penny stocks thru online broker. Seems like it hasn't improved much.
6086 2018-01-05 14:24:29 Why $ 300 is achievable? Assuming that the market value of the entire digital currency has risen four times on the current basis, it is assumed that bit stocks also rise fourfold. That is equivalent to another 59 times up to reach.
6087 2018-01-05 14:24:24 Great! Now I can sell all those stocks I... Don't have...
6088 2018-01-05 14:24:19 Stocks! Thanks predictive text!

6090 2018-01-05 14:23:37 Could be red again today for pot stocks it looks like. I am in low enough thankfully that these dips don't sting too bad. Good time to accumulate for some. Bad for others who bought in close to the highs.

6092 2018-01-05 14:23:23 Speaking of stocks, thx a lot for going back on your word. You promised repub Cory Gardner you wouldn't touch pot in exchange for his support. I invested based on your word & my stocks crashed yesterday. Thx a lot. Don't start going back on your word like politicians
6093 2018-01-05 14:23:14 HAHAHA trump....his make america great again cheese worked....cus the only things his done are, make getting sweatshop money back into his accounts from overseas, got Dakota oil money into his accounts & putins and making sure pharmaceutical stocks top out next.
6094 2018-01-05 14:23:12 Except that Americans don’t survive on stocks and business alone. We exist for more than just going to work for corporations and making more money for people like you. We exist to innovate, to create, to be a beacon and share democracy with the world. #Clueless
6095 2018-01-05 14:23:08 Do you realize that only 50% of us have money in stocks?  I would rather spend some of that for healthcare for everyone!
6096 2018-01-05 14:22:23 Don’t worry about it. You have tweeted about it four times in the past 24 hours. For people like me, with no stocks, I am sick of you touting about the rich getting richer.
6097 2018-01-05 14:22:18 These China  stocks have been making big moves! $CNET $CNIT $CPHI $CCIH I love the momentum this week!
6098 2018-01-05 14:21:46 What about the two or three hundred million citizens who don't have stocks?
6099 2018-01-05 14:21:37 Stock purchases are between individuals and that money does not go back to the company.  Only IPO’s make money so a company expand.  BTW the top 10% own 80% of the stocks out there so no the average day joe really isn’t a big part of the stock market participants.
6100 2018-01-05 14:21:34 The only one in this game is the rich and shameless... The average working person, or even most middle class workers, don't indulge in the stocks Donald! You and your cohorts have done enormous damage to our country! Resign while you can!
6101 2018-01-05 14:21:32 I honestly don't think he cares. His base, who generally are not among those who own stocks, still support him That's all that matters.
6102 2018-01-05 14:21:09 Demand causes hires. When corporations get tax breaks, they buy back stocks and give bonuses to their higher ups. History has borne this out.
6103 2018-01-05 14:21:09 at club doom
6104 2018-01-05 14:21:05 No dude. Only 1% of the country cares about the stocks.  People are working two jobs just to survive.
6105 2018-01-05 14:20:52 No, no!  The corporate tax breaks are working!  Congrats!!  But, at least the stock market so up, so all those workers stocks holdings have increased in value!!  There’s always a silver lining, eh @JohnCornyn ?
6106 2018-01-05 14:20:45 Tax reform bonuses to lift retail stocks, Barclays says as it upgrades Target, Lowe's...
6107 2018-01-05 14:20:31 You are full of . The wealthiest top 10 % own 80% of the stocks. It is about the rich getting richer. Stocks have nothing to do with jobs as job growth slowed in 2016 to the slowest growth in 6 years.
6108 2018-01-05 14:20:16 They don’t talk about it because everyone knows the stocks are going up. It has been for the last 8 years. Why talk about it for 8 years?  MSM talk about you because you are making us look like children. Britain please take us back our leader is making us look bad.
6109 2018-01-05 14:20:14 Hmmm funny since the stocks are still updating g from previous terms.
6110 2018-01-05 14:19:51 @laurnjohnsonfox29 Buying shares of stocks as gifts  is one of the best things I have heard of good day ever.  I am  wealth manager, and I tell clients that all the time! Great job!!

6113 2018-01-05 14:19:00 56% of all Americans have no money to invest in stocks. This doesn't help them at all. People like you, this is HUGE news. For so many of your base, it means nothing.
6114 2018-01-05 14:18:40 They do mention it every night on the nightly news just like they always have for all presidents. Just because they’re not always patting you on the back for it doesn’t mean their not reporting it. Also your not the only president in office when stocks have gone up. Did for Obama
6115 2018-01-05 14:18:32 AKA China stocks
6116 2018-01-05 14:18:32 Trump always boast about stock market upward trend which is fallacious achievement & we have seen massive booming of stocks which can never be indicators of health education employment and inflation which concerns common man.

6121 2018-01-05 14:17:54 December unemployment stats not good. Stocks all time high, economy should be great. It is not. All credit creation going into stocks, bonds, cryptos.  Very soon, all the energy of the credit will not be able to keep stocks levitating higher. Massive fall will occur. Historical?
6122 2018-01-05 14:17:49 Dow up 25,000, only the elite benefit. MJ stocks gave us hope to have the American dream. Sessions took this away. @realDonaldTrump  is not standing by his word! He will lose a lot of votes over this

6126 2018-01-05 14:16:13 Gee, should we give you a participation award?  We are still feeling the affects of the great Economy that President Obama created. The Stock Market only affects those able to buy stocks, keep bragging about something you had very little affect on Donny.

6128 2018-01-05 14:16:01 Mr. Varney Thank you for your monitoring. Cutting Taxes so the 1% can reinvest in their own stocks (raising the cap) only gives a timely illusion of a healthy economy.
6129 2018-01-05 14:15:10 There are characteristics that have been proven over long periods to be associated with above-average rates of return: low P/Es, discounts to book value, low debt/equity ratios, stocks with recent significant price declines, companies with [insider buying] -- Will Browne

6132 2018-01-05 14:14:45 And incidentally, as every real investor will tell you, for all of the Dow's rise, the smart money was in stocks outside the US. Significantly better gains.

6136 2018-01-05 14:14:11 You do realize that the wealthiest 10% own 80% of all stocks, right?  Let us know when you do something long term to help the middle and lower class.

6139 2018-01-05 14:13:49 You only care about $.  Many other people care about quality of life.   I don't have stocks, therefore I could care less about them.  I want good quality health care,  which you failed to provide.  I want a a safe and effective Internet, which you failed to provide.

6163 2018-01-05 14:07:59 I think pot stocks will finish fine today but the morning will still be dealing with the fallout from yesterday.  Just hold and buy more low if you can

6165 2018-01-05 14:06:54 Cloud based stocks are blooming this morning @SquawkStreet @CNBCnow
6166 2018-01-05 14:06:51 For my future kids’ gifts I’m going to get them stocks/crypto instead of toys. They’ll thank me later 
6167 2018-01-05 14:06:50 @Varneyco UR making me ill. Seems to me that we have two Americas. With the DOW and GDP this high why was there not an explosion in jobs? What kind of economy is @potus running that it benefits only those with stocks?
6168 2018-01-05 14:06:47 Am sure it’ll shock you to learn that a large portion of Americans don’t own stocks & for them Wall Street is just a rich man park, i.e, your disciples in Kentucky & West Virginia
6169 2018-01-05 14:06:29 TRUMP BRAGS ABOUT TANKING HEALTH INSURANCE STOCKS.
6170 2018-01-05 14:05:54 50% of Americans do not have a single $ invested in the stock market. 10% of Americans own 80% of all existing US stocks. Your obsession with the market is further evidence of your incompetence and low intelligence.
6171 2018-01-05 14:05:43 also, the issue's been know for six months and no patch is available now. Why? I bet now that the media are on it and stocks are tumbling there will be patches within a week. #sad
6172 2018-01-05 14:05:13 stocks being bought credit, margins, historic levels suggest the market is topping & any fall that might trigger calls could be severe. I don't agree with what they are saying on FOX business.
6173 2018-01-05 14:05:03 WE DON'T OWN ANY STOCKS! AND I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO DOES. HALF OF AMERICANS DON'T OWN STOCKS WHICH IS WHY WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK!
6174 2018-01-05 14:04:50 America?  As of 2016, foreigners owned about 25% of outstanding corporate bonds, 15% of American stocks and 12% of agency securities.  Nearly all Dow companies have operations outside the US.  We live in a global economy.
6175 2018-01-05 14:04:28 do you know which stocks in your list had a split last year? Didn’t think so.
6176 2018-01-05 14:04:22 Obama contintues to Rock the Stocks!!!!!!!!!!!  You go, Obama the great and wonderful.
6177 2018-01-05 14:04:01 and $BTC does move 10% a day at least... although you can't use leverage on that move. So you need 1% moves in stocks with gearing to match.. easy game to find that every day. That said... the idea is to reduce volatility and risk anyway.
6178 2018-01-05 14:03:43 GDP and stock increases is not the way to measure how healthy our society is. The income gap increases and more people slip into poverty. Rising stocks are mostly beneficial to the already wealthy.

6185 2018-01-05 14:02:34 I am not in this stock and rarely place such low priced stocks, but looking at the daily chart ONLY (I have no idea what they do), if you have patience, it seems like the consolidation at the bottom is starting to slowly go up.....  I hope for you it continues. Good luck.
6186 2018-01-05 14:02:33 2 cents...The article is about bonds not stocks. The NYSE /Dow are stocks..equity shares. Around 50% of Americans own stocks. Approx 1% own ind bonds...corp/muni debt. Regardless it aint making us rich like them.

6197 2018-01-05 14:01:13 According to the Pew Research Center, 55% of Americans own stocks, which means that a little more than half the country is effected by the uptick.
6198 2018-01-05 14:00:41 Faux News must know how ill-informed it's viewers are to keep repeating a meaningless stat.  The economy is NOT the stock market.  And vice versa.

"Collectively, only 4 in 10 Americans, 43 percent, own stocks, reports Bankrate."
6199 2018-01-05 14:00:41 Answer is no, nor do any of the other numbers suggest it yet WS is damned determined to have it and will deny reality once again by bidding up stocks over their imagined recovery. Otherwise, CB will step in again w/ neg rates this time.
6200 2018-01-05 14:00:35 Record setting stocks yes, does not necessarily represent economy. Once some of his questionable ideas take effect, it will crumble, just watch. He takes credit for good things that are not his and denies anything negative. No one is perfect like his base portrays him to be.
6201 2018-01-05 14:00:35 Simon - recall that because of the bursting housing bubble created by WJC, stocks had dropped way down. When it was able to climb back it was mostly regains. This year it's been ALL about new gains. Stubborn things indeed.
6202 2018-01-05 14:00:28 @realDonaldTrump Pot Stocks. Emerg rooms hand out Oxy like candy.  Terrible stuff. I see my sis with cancer eat, gain weight and laugh with Med Marijuana vs being drugged up. They say that pot is a gateway drug but I say drug dealers are the gateway.  Legal pot makes it safer?
6203 2018-01-05 14:00:21 @finecheeseco I’m desperately trying to find your oh so delicious toasts for cheese and striking out! Can you let me know where stocks them near London Bridge? Thank you!
6204 2018-01-05 14:00:19 You do realize there’s more to your job than growing the value of stocks, right?
6205 2018-01-05 14:00:15 Where is all that money puring into stocks actually coming from? Central banks didn't accelerate the printers recently and surveys show that investors cash levels are low for a while now. As the dollar continues to weaken it could be foreign money scaling in. #stocks #dowjones
6206 2018-01-05 14:00:14 Middle class Americans. You go!oh wait you didnt and don’t participate in the run up of the market. In fact by most accounts. Less than half the population owns stocks in any form.
6207 2018-01-05 14:00:12 stocks do not reflect job growth or the average American... you have no clue of the real reality here. The only ones better off are the top 1 percent

6210 2018-01-05 13:59:51 Hopefully $ROKU price action can push through VWAP at the opening (& stay under the 200 SMA) I love when stocks show strength on a weak chart setup (gap down chart) reversal entry setup.. Keep an eye on level 2 bids.. let’s short this bitch.. Easy work  
6211 2018-01-05 13:59:51 These penny stocks are making me smile more and more every day 
6212 2018-01-05 13:59:36 Buddy please don't call my recos as satta.. Either I give you well researched stocks, or stocks I have heard from good sources.. nothing is casino-like on my timeline
6213 2018-01-05 13:59:25 @mystockedge only few stocks are shown in 70 above rsi ?
6214 2018-01-05 13:59:10 Very good news for the richest 10%, who own 80% of stocks.
6215 2018-01-05 13:59:05 It definitely seems suspect that when Cannabis stocks are dropping these banks trading platforms cease functioning, affectively controlling the selloff more than an IIROC halt. Yet when there is massive buying volume they work perfectly fine.
6216 2018-01-05 13:58:36 1.  Most of America does not benefit from stocks.  2.  Coal mining deaths are up.  3.  Mass shootings (American on American terrorism) are up.  4. Crime rates, drug deaths are up. 5.  Nursing home deaths will rise.  This is how history will judge you. A failure.
6217 2018-01-05 13:58:34 What you don't understand is the few supporters you have left don't own stocks! Moonpie's & Mountain Dew maybe. #Trumpwits #Trumpflakes #Trumpanzees
6218 2018-01-05 13:58:26 For the wealthy. We common mortals don’t have much (if any) money in the stock market. And job creation doesn’t happen just because stock prices go up. Will you take responsibility for it when stocks go down? No? I didn’t think so.
6219 2018-01-05 13:58:19 Sir, how do you look at relative strength of the stock? Do you compare it with other stocks in same sector or with Nifty? And relative strength over a month/quarter or something else? Any particular rules for this? Will be grt if you could share.
6220 2018-01-05 13:57:57 When companies are buying back their own stocks and laying off workers, it is basically a class war.
6221 2018-01-05 13:57:18 Looks like a great start to Friday ahead for $SX pre market flirting with a dollar.  Pre market for pot stocks looks flat to low.
6222 2018-01-05 13:57:17 Yeah but you aren't popular, or the things you do. Off Shore drilling not supported. Gutting Net Neutrality very unpopular, along with tax plan.  Ajit Pai receiving death threats-he's up to no good.  Poor people aren't too interested in stocks, too many worry about next meal.
6223 2018-01-05 13:57:13 Hi Tony!  Not sure - I'll have to look.  To be clear, I'm very bullish stocks & bearish USD.
6224 2018-01-05 13:56:54 That's BS. 2.1 million jobs created in 2017. Your bias and hatred of Trump is getting exhausting. Check your stocks. Trump voters will come out in droves.
6225 2018-01-05 13:56:31 "Well, Jim, with the apocalypse looming analysts are seeing a boom in unhealthy dining options, with fast food stocks soaring."
"There's always a silver lining, Bob!"
6226 2018-01-05 13:56:23 So like, is your whole presidency just gonna be you talking about stocks or will you actually be achieving something?
6227 2018-01-05 13:56:09 Stocks only tripled with “O”. Of course if stocks go down...it’s not my fault.
6228 2018-01-05 13:55:39 we will see, stocks are very expensive on wallstreet.

6230 2018-01-05 13:55:24 Collectively, 4 in 10 Americans, 43 percent, own stocks, majority of which is 401Ks. 

That’s 57% who don’t have a penny invested. 

Also, I know a lot of people with 401s and most don’t even look at it except maybe at the end of the year. It’s not like they’re moving $ around.

6234 2018-01-05 13:54:32 With his "big, beautiful" tax cuts, companies are buying back their own stocks. They are also laying off thousands of workers. He is screwing the very base who voted for him.
6235 2018-01-05 13:54:30 $ES_F likely to consolidate for a while after reaching January target 2750 next week. Hot stocks may not be able to pop much in the coming earning season.
6236 2018-01-05 13:54:21 Of course it will go down, but not for long.  Stocks always bounce back, and the recovery period is getting shorter with each passing decade
6237 2018-01-05 13:54:02 Just don’t invest in stocks or bonds right now.  At least not American markets.
6238 2018-01-05 13:53:55 So, you have a lot invested in stocks I presume? If so, good for you, smart move. But the average American, including myself, does not. Stock market is not equal to economy. Educate.
6239 2018-01-05 13:53:54 Have your wages gone up?  Is your job secure ? I hope so. Are you invested in stocks to  get help there? I hope so as it is the only place to improve your income. President does not support wage increases but is asking others to do so for their businesses. Not likely to happen.

6243 2018-01-05 13:53:16 When stocks go up or down. If employment goes up or down. If cost of living goes up or down etc. We don't credit our Prime Minister. He doesn't take the credit. He just says. "It's a good day" Thank God I'm Canadian. We don't have an egotistical leader in power.
6244 2018-01-05 13:52:42 The richest 0.1% of Americans own as much as the entire bottom 90%, and the wealthiest 10% own nearly 90% of stocks, according to data from DB Global Markets Research and the World Wealth and Income Database.
6245 2018-01-05 13:52:41 The immediate reaction by #markets to the US #jobs report include higher #stocks , lower #yields, and a weaker #dollar – together, this will be seen as consistent with a “Goldilocks” market interpretation of this morning’s data.

6246 2018-01-05 13:52:38 Its illegal because it isnt fair for everyone else who has shares but dont have any way of knowing if the stocks will rise or fall but he does because he is on the inside and taking advantage of his position and information to make money

6256 2018-01-05 13:50:27 Modest job growth, stagnant wages. The stock market is not a measure of economic growth! It means the 50% who own stocks, primarily wealthy, are getting richer. How stupid are you?!?

6260 2018-01-05 13:49:21 and the surge is corporations buying back their own stocks as a result of the #TaxScamBill

6273 2018-01-05 13:45:58 Juxtapose this information against fake Fox news who got on the airwaves to fight against the left critique of the rise in stocks benefiting the rich. They're constantly distorting the real issues.
6274 2018-01-05 13:45:56 Exactly Maria! Not only is #marijuana negatively impacting the jobs report, stocks (e.g., $STZ), but also #NationalSecurity .It’s historically accurate to declare a country’s Strength of Materials(SoM) decides Economic status and #weed is a weak material. #FBN
6275 2018-01-05 13:44:38 Taxes serve a purpose. You just cut $1.5T. Where is the money for this (as yet unrevealed) infrastructure plan going to come from? Stocks can rally, but the middle class will feel it in basic service cuts & discretionary income covering them.

6283 2018-01-05 13:43:21 Actually, stock market is one of the best economic indicators available.  As stocks increase, pension funds go up.  As do Corporate expansion via research & development.  This adds jobs and salary increases to the “everyday joe”.  Hope my tweet clears up that misconception.
6284 2018-01-05 13:43:13 Was just thinking about this! Most think they will benefit directly— most aren’t investing in stocks. It’ll trickle down

6288 2018-01-05 13:42:57 Agree. But the critique is clear: GDP is measuring flows, not stocks. And for any country - and for the world - stocks, not least of natural capital, are crucial. Natural capital is not an ideal term but I find no better one to use; a stable climate is of course part of nat cap
6289 2018-01-05 13:42:30 If you are a trader sitting at your computer this week waiting to short stocks, you really need to get out of your comfort zone and understand that you are not a trader that will last long term - as you do not react to where (sector) the money is flowing into. Learn & adapt

6291 2018-01-05 13:42:04 Donald, you do realise that the average middle class worker does not buy stocks. You know dabbling on Wall Street is a hobby for your millionaire and billionaire buddies?

If so everyone carry on
6293 2018-01-05 13:40:15 Can u imagine where stocks would be if Barak Obama had not put strict regulatory controls on corrupt bankers and stock inside traders, Donald?  You're just blowing steam and Mueller is closing in.
6294 2018-01-05 13:40:09 What a great week to be trading long all of these low float stocks. Remember this fantastic bull market we are in, should be appreciated. If you are a "short bias" trader.... learn to become a well rounded trader.
6295 2018-01-05 13:39:57 @GappistanRadio - Reliable sources in the finance ministry have said you can expect fantastic tax cuts of nearly Rs 1000 reduction in taxable income, and nearly Rs 750 bonanza in income taxes. Plus there are benefits if you risk dumping all your PF money in startup stocks.

YOU AND YOUR PALS.
6319 2018-01-05 13:33:29 If people receive a paycheck means they work for someone that has stocks. If these Leopoldo or enterprises are winning they can hire more people, increase salaries & not fire people. Economics 101....

6323 2018-01-05 13:33:19 They're as entertaining as Nickelodeon, Adult Swim on Comedy Channel and the Home Shopping Network. Most make laughing stocks out of themselves, or they're  trying to make a profit off their worthless creations.

6334 2018-01-05 13:30:08 Economic movement happens when people do work. The stock market share prices go up when people think about work. Stocks are not an economy.  And your policies haven't taken effect yet anyway.

6344 2018-01-05 13:27:38 Trucks & logistics industry is big in USA. Many truck companies are listed on the NYSE, stocks have their own index.

In South Africa, trucking companies are small but highly profitable, many are owned & run by boere families. Barriers to entry for Africans, are Fort-Knox tight.

6347 2018-01-05 13:27:07 And this is the problem.  The stock market means very LITTLE to the majority of americans.   The "forgotten men and women" as you call the middle class have little to no interest in stocks that they don't own and can't purchase.  You are bragging on something irrelevant to us.

6349 2018-01-05 13:26:50 The only ones benefiting from your new tax plan are the shareholders of the NYSE and those who can afford the stocks. However,  whenever there is a big up, there is always a big down. The last two big downs on the NYSE were overseen by Republican POTUS. Could you be the third?
6350 2018-01-05 13:26:33 A major correction is coming this year. Stocks are way over valued... like the tech bubble in 1999 and 2000.
6351 2018-01-05 13:26:28 Live within our means I guess and then chip away at it / inflate it away.

6352 2018-01-05 13:26:26 If you look, you'll see I'm not ignoring the market. Half of Americans are hardly helped by the market's new record.  The richest 10% own 84% of stocks. Wages have been trailing inflation since July. I care more about what happens to workers than to investors-they're doing great.
6353 2018-01-05 13:26:14 Long stocks like printing money, everyday is a new day......till.....
6354 2018-01-05 13:25:47 No need to be stereotypical here. Pretty sure most people own stocks/bonds/etc through employment and money market accounts. 

Everyone should care. Good place to put that extra tax money.

6381 2018-01-05 13:19:51 Here's how I see it: synchronistic global growth + low interest rates led to a surge in corporate profits, which in turn pushed worldwide stocks higher. It looks like those elements are in place in 2018, but for how long, who knows?

6388 2018-01-05 13:17:16 nope.
poor deductive skills: the poll says NOTHING how much better off people who do own stocks are.  blue chips (& stocks in general) are not the totality of economic indicators for those who do own stocks.

6393 2018-01-05 13:15:43 The stock market is NOT an indicator of a strong economy and is driven by short-term daily, even to the minute, speculation and emotion. The market was at a high in 2006 before it dropped 22% in 8 days in 2007 (The Big Short). Stocks are overvalued (think Amazon)#StockMarket

6416 2018-01-05 13:11:50 The stock market helps those who have stocks. The majority of Americans do not own stocks. So you keep touting a number irrelevant to most people. Also, AT&T and Macy's are cutting thousands of Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. #liveintherealworld #fakePOTUS
6417 2018-01-05 13:11:43 Dumbass. The stock market reacts to different economic factors than what you believe is your doing. Stocks of companies actually shoot up when massive layoffs are announced. The market moves with anticipation of making a fast buck. Not with how workers are benefiting.

6423 2018-01-05 13:08:21 CNBC reporting 5 stocks contributed to HALF of the stock market gains in 2017.....lol

so what would happen to the market if there was a correction in those 5 stocks?
6424 2018-01-05 13:07:22 Apparently no price is to high to pay for any stock- with valuations no longer a concern for traders- we will find a top only when stocks reach a level where traders are no longer willing to step in, but with complacency low & greed high it may be a while $QQQ $DIA $IWM $EEM $QQQ

6450 2018-01-05 13:00:11 What’s your take on Sessions creating billions in short selling of cannabis stocks ONE DAY after they soared? Obvious manipulation and SEC violations by the AG.

6455 2018-01-05 12:58:23 You should investigate Jeff Sessions. What he did yesterday was criminal, creating billions in illegal profits for short sellers, ONE day after cannabis stocks soared. No coincidence. Rather obvious SEC violations by our AG.

I'm a silent follower of you from couple of years. invested around 6.5L in batches in 20+ stocks includes most of your suggestions,  Now on 75% profits with 11.5L, is it a good idea to take back 6.5 to prepayment of H-loan & keep the profits in High quality stocks
6528 2018-01-05 12:33:40 We need money not jobs... But I'm really happy the rich are getting richer off the stocks....
6529 2018-01-05 12:33:29 Making banking more profitable for bankers...thats all. Anyone look at which stocks have rose? And why?
6530 2018-01-05 12:33:14 Now since you got all that out. How does that affect the middle/ barely making it class? Only 10% of the people owns stocks profiting a couple hundred dollars gains while the wealthy 1% that own stocks are profiting. (corporations)Stocks don't impress me. I'm a poor simple man.

6542 2018-01-05 12:28:19 It wouldn’t have gotten there without the running start Obama gave it! Both stocks and jobs! And any gain the market has made due to your deregulation will likely be short lived or lead to an eventual crash! No wonder your businesses went bankrupt!
6543 2018-01-05 12:26:09 83% of Americans don’t own stocks, so this means dick to them. 80% of the benefits in your “tax reform” go to the top 1% of wealthiest Americans. Income inequality continues to grow as it has under every president for 40 years. You want credit for something, fix that!

6551 2018-01-05 12:23:44 Granted, a higher stock market reflects the optimism of those who can afford to buy stocks, such as company CEO's who buy their own shares to drive up the prices. As for those without money to gamble on stocks, they're hit with threats to slash Medicare & Social Security.
6552 2018-01-05 12:23:32 Stocks also holding gains with the DAX still up over 1%
6553 2018-01-05 12:23:07 How many times do you have to be told that as the president you have nothing to do with the stock market going up or down?  In fact 99% of your base does not have stocks, most don’t even have $500 dollars in case of an emergency.

6557 2018-01-05 12:22:40 This book of rubbish is another ploy to take attention away from Clinton probes/investigations. The country has never been on a better economic standing. Unemployment down, stocks up, wages up, cleaning house. Let POTUS continue 2 MAGA. Obutthead playing puppeteer
6558 2018-01-05 12:22:33 ye, they are grazy that they still buy stocks.
They are expensive.
6559 2018-01-05 12:22:19 The stock market is not an accurate indicator of the economy. Most of the stocks are owned by large institutions. Mom and pop aren’t getting really rich on the stock market. The media should do a story on who actually owns a vast majority of the stocks on both exchanges.
6560 2018-01-05 12:22:10 If the downturn is still years away, there are yet massive profits to be made in the stock market. Although i would exect intrest rates to move money out of stocks towards the bond market, once they provide at least some returns again. Stocks are already the only intrest yielders
6561 2018-01-05 12:21:55 USG Raised to Outperform From Neutral by Baird    This is the 2nd upgrade within minutes. Move fast . Warren Buffett owns 28% of this company. In 2007 this #stock peaked at over $100 per share. #invest #investing #investment #stockstobuy #stocks #money #TradingStrategies

6614 2018-01-05 12:09:23 “you all just got a lot richer”

Less than half of all Americans own stocks;

The top 10% of Americans hold 4x as much value as the bottom 90%. 

The top 1% alone holds twice as much value as the bottom 90%. 

That’s where most of the benefit to an increase in stock values goes.

6663 2018-01-05 11:52:33 Yes, it's his doing. When you run a country that has 25% of the world's economy, and optimism increases in that country, you get bounces in European stocks. The US is leading again.
6664 2018-01-05 11:52:32 You are the only idiot that does not know they most of the stocks are owned by foreigners

6675 2018-01-05 11:47:00 But honestly do stocks help everyone or the wealthy and corporations? Where are the jobs?
6676 2018-01-05 11:46:39 Man, stocks are off to an insane start this year.
6677 2018-01-05 11:45:43 ...since dems behave like a tribe hating our president and his fiscal  policies, ask them if they are selling their stocks. are you? if not, that's hypocritical, right? good luck in the elections.

6696 2018-01-05 11:38:45 The stock market has been going up since 2009. Remember, only 50% of the people own stocks. Your rich peers are the benefactor of this upward trek. Not the American people
6697 2018-01-05 11:38:30 One of the things that I should start this 2018 is to fund my COL Account and start trading but PSEi is still high and part of me is waiting for the stocks to drop so I can do some “stock shopping”.
6698 2018-01-05 11:38:17 Thanks to Sessions, all the stocks relating to cannabis took a nose dive. Way down. Fire this idiot. He needs to focus on the corruption in DC & leave the states alone.

6710 2018-01-05 11:32:30 Wall Street experts agree this has NOTHING to do with Trump and everything to do with global economies performing better and earnings improving. Besides, the majority of Americans don’t own stocks. This makes no difference to the average citizen. All about the 1%

6721 2018-01-05 11:24:32 It's actually easier than that.

If you buy decent stocks when they're really cheap you don't have to worry about selling . Making big money is all about high conviction positions and holding them.

I know most don't do that.
6722 2018-01-05 11:24:27 People making #UnlivableWages don’t own stocks. The People deserve a #LivableWage. #TrickleDown is NOT a sound economic strategy and does not benefit the small guy.

6728 2018-01-05 11:22:38 This is the same reasons, Warren Buffet and traditional stocks traders stay away from bitcoin. It is correct what you say, however it all comes down to which time frame one uses.
6729 2018-01-05 11:20:43 How much did the value of your stocks plummet during the crash though? You would have had to wait a while just to get the value of your investments back to where they were. Tell me what is 28 x 8. 28 percent is just the beginning to.

Just type in ACWX (all world stock index EXCEPT United States) and see how it has been outpacing US stocks for over 12 months
6733 2018-01-05 11:15:41 I don't know if something similar exists in economics and would like some feedback but I think this is true:

6739 2018-01-05 11:14:26 If @POTUS is as smart at business as he says he is, he would over rule Sessions on pot, fed legalize it so all banks can take in money, send the stock market even higher by allowing pots stocks to soar, and create billions for the economy, hed never lose again!
6740 2018-01-05 11:14:25 Maintenant il y a des modèles qui permettent de prédire l'évolution du EROI selon le type d'énergie ainsi que les stocks des différentes ressources. Il faut donc intégrer ces données dans les investissements productifs selon que les ressources soit limités ou renouvelables.

6809 2018-01-05 10:40:17 There are 2 sides, the many and the few. The few hold the majority of the money today because the money of the many is actually with the few (banks, stocks...). Take that out of the the equation and the many will have more money than the few.
6810 2018-01-05 10:40:10 Geographical separation is one small part. You fail to account for natural disasters and historical events. Moreover, the concept of "races" also seem to leave out populations that are mixture of the racial stocks.

6817 2018-01-05 10:36:59 I think entering in steel sector is not easy now. New entrants will be in tension. Retail just need few stocks in a year. Even if you own six companies and can find six companies turn it is total 6+6 companies to take call. Enough for retail investors.

6825 2018-01-05 10:32:21 Not from my experience. You can pay around $150 and they find you an attorney to issue stocks.
But also, we have a very simple setup with 2 founders and no investors. So it helps.

6831 2018-01-05 10:27:28 Some Rules which kept me alive:
1. avoid shorting float rotation stocks (low float) on day 1
2. avoid shorting strong stocks late day
3. leave midday if u must to avoid the grind
4. when shorting, stop out on high of day break - @modern_rock

6911 2018-01-05 09:43:47 read a paper today saying another 50-60% advance in US stocks will mean pretty much a likely crash of 50-60% later on, so we need more accelerating gains for this to turn into a real mania

6914 2018-01-05 09:41:34 I'll play along with your hypothesis and assume that stocks and executive pay will be the only outcome, even though you've provided no basis for this claim.

6919 2018-01-05 09:35:21 Yes the stock market hit a new high, Yes #realnews #cnn #msnbc #abc, etc reported it. The overall increase started under Obama. You know PRESIDENT OBAMA. Also, stocks are not an indication of JOBS JOBS JOBS, just MONEY MONEY MONEY.
6920 2018-01-05 09:35:01 So... in Feb 2017 Sessions shows his support of private prisons (who donated hugely in 2016 campaign) and their stocks "soar".  Where were their stock prices today?  Askin' for a friend!!!
6921 2018-01-05 09:34:14 Coming off aim where you can hold stocks for months waiting for news, I find it mental that on crypto investors panic on every correction and can't even wait a day if there is no increase shown.
Nothing goes up in a straight line.

He wasn't trying to do anything of the sort, and you know that.

6925 2018-01-05 09:31:09 Wealth only created when stocks are Sold and exchanged for a medium not subject to market swings.
The investor’s attitude in a rising market is to hold on for higher prices, only to sell when prices are falling.
Until sold only “paper” gains.

6942 2018-01-05 09:23:04 Maybe your prediction about the Dow is going to come true but my opinion of Gold is not related to the stock market. Why would it fly on a panic in stocks? Last time there was panic in stocks(2008) Gold declined along with it. Gold has its own cyclicality.

Yes via a smart contract it’s possible. This is what this is. These aren’t currencies. No, they’re assets. That can be bought and sold and in time this will happen completely on the blockchain via decentralised exchanges

7001 2018-01-05 08:40:32 But how about the monies in the banks? Why are there lots of them untouched & just being invested?

7033 2018-01-05 08:19:10 Options

With many FNO stocks making breakouts, its time to mint money with Options 

ROI in Options is much higher than Stock buying

What matters

*Choosing the Strike (Slight ITM, ATM or slight OTM), 
*Buying strategically to handle time value decay

7102 2018-01-05 07:43:24 A viable trading strategy is to even profit from the losses. When stocks go down, place orders at many levels. I just put significant amount into #XRP  at many points when it was down. That's the strategy I want you to adopt.

7104 2018-01-05 07:42:19 I’m sure they would talk about it but you distract them with all the nonsense you say and do so it’s hardly surprising is it? When you’re having a Twitter spat with North Korea over who has the biggest button do you actually expect the news outlets to talk about stocks? Grow up.

7107 2018-01-05 07:40:24 That's also a possibility but this is what we would like to call a investment. Nothing is guaranteed to happened just like stocks or cryptocurrencies. It might lose money in the matter of seconds or maybe triple in value overnight. You never really now what will happen.

7112 2018-01-05 07:37:04 Even though I keep suggesting stocks there is this fear at  the back of mind that this is an unreal and very expensive market that can fall at the slightest excuse.

IMO, the best strategy is to stick to turnaround stories with potential. Their fall will not hurt pockets.

7116 2018-01-05 07:33:32 I've been investing in stocks for 50 years and this is the most perfect environment ever. High employment, low inflation, low interest rates, low taxes, cash coming in from overseas, record profits. This bull has a ways to run.
7117 2018-01-05 07:33:03 Certainly. Still, for some reason, I keep being amazed by such displays of absurd.

7120 2018-01-05 07:31:42 Sometimes I long for the days when we had stocks set up in the public square, and baskets of rotten fruit for the citizens to toss.

Only sometimes. This is one of those times.
7121 2018-01-05 07:30:16 The last 17 charts I posted are not quite half of my entire portfolio. I prefer smaller position sizes to keep individual stock risk low. I’ve done the “buy a small basket of stocks and watch them very close” strategy, and it wasn’t for me.

7183 2018-01-05 06:50:16 Everyone has his own style of making money in markets. I have many times bought expensive high PE stocks and still made a decent amount of money in them. It depends on case to case. Every richly valued co is not a bad investment and every cheap co is not a good investment.

Lithium Weed Blockchain all ran yes but AI?
7206 2018-01-05 06:22:14 AS USUAL you are WRONG!!  I watch more than #foxandfriends and the Stock Market is mentioned EVERY TRADING DAY!   The problem is that STOCKS don't rise and fall because of Presidents and YOU DO NOT DESERVE THE CREDIT for all market rises....
7207 2018-01-05 06:20:43 You suck . It’s a waste of money . Save it so yo white ass can buy sum stocks instead.
7208 2018-01-05 06:20:23 Ict is/was a men thing. I think thats y more men i  it in begin. Like trading stocks. I dont know tbh, but that seem like a "mensworld" 2 me too. When it get more known, easier & money go easy up, maybe women step in easier then when its unsure. And men can use that 2 think twice
7209 2018-01-05 06:20:13 Was in a kick ass mood all day; lunch in San Diego, stocks rallied up again, my Amazon order arrives a day early, a client gifts me some Jack Daniels, and sold my old Astro A40s. 
7210 2018-01-05 06:20:05 Make rich people richer you mean. I don't own stock, I don't believe most Americans own stocks. So what?!
7211 2018-01-05 06:19:56 You have to play with lots of other stocks instead...
7212 2018-01-05 06:19:25 This is because the top 1% is winning now. No one middle class or poor can afford to buy stocks.

7216 2018-01-05 06:17:34 Et maintenant les stocks sont dangereusement menacés... alors qu' il a fallu beaucoup d'efforts marketing pour installer la conso de thon en boite aux US, et qu'on n'en mangeait quasiment pas au Japon avant la guerre. Cruelle ironie.

7251 2018-01-05 06:00:28 Got you're so stupid it's painful.....after the crash is 08 the only thing the market could do was go up. This is why Obama shows he had a higher percentage growth. Are you this stupid or don't understand how even stocks work?

7255 2018-01-05 05:58:35 Michael, I assume trade indexes will behave the same? Have you perhaps trade indexes and stocks as well with same approach?
7256 2018-01-05 05:58:32 I would think sports betting in India would far outweigh this number if you include unofficial channels. Legalising cricket and lowering taxes on racing is the solution. It’s the perception of gambling that’s the problem here. And then day trading on stocks isn’t frowned upon!

7305 2018-01-05 05:33:21 @AskRobinhood I am experience some liquidity issue as my stocks are forever in transit. The transfer process is pending for days and the estimated availability somehow continues to delay. I have a urgent need to trade, please help make them available! Ticket# 1229458
7306 2018-01-05 05:33:16 The problem is... NO ONE IN REAL AMERICA CARES... only the wealthy have stocks. 75% of Americans barely know what the stock market is. Only individuals who aren't living paycheck to paycheck care. #GetALife

7309 2018-01-05 05:32:43 @realDonaldTrump 50% of Americans own no stocks.  The money is not going into higher wages, new hires or new construction.  This helps nearly no one who needs it.  WEAK!
7310 2018-01-05 05:31:29 Congrats. I was having a very average day trying to find an entry into a few stocks for a couple of pips  ended up not doing anything and ASN pulled this out

7312 2018-01-05 05:30:44 Why you always hating on my stocks?   Kidding I like to hear both sides to keep grounded.
7313 2018-01-05 05:30:38 Just the standard. Did you make the stocks or buy them TheraPlate?

7316 2018-01-05 05:29:02 Not necessarily stocks have moved 100% in a week even in consolidation phases of markets.Both have their own utilities.There is nothing right or wrong in markets
7317 2018-01-05 05:27:44 Percentage of Americans who own stocks: ~40%.
Percentage of private sector workers who have pensions invested in the market: 13%

For a lot of us, the Dow doesn't mean diddly.
7318 2018-01-05 05:27:41 Average #Trumpkin: WOO HOO! Dow is up! #MAGA!!

What’s the Dow?

AT: Um...stocks n such!

So you have a large portfolio? So this benefits you?

AT: A large what now? I ain’t got money fer stocks. Walmart pays 8 an hour!

Ah. So this means what for you?

AT: Uh...MAGA!! Woo!


7319 2018-01-05 05:27:40 Also marijuana stocks plummeted yesterday after @jeffsessions rolled back Obama’s let the states decide rules. @GOP sucks!
7320 2018-01-05 05:27:35 Bro.. first of all, the last two times the market crashed, it had preciously reached record highs... Secondly, this country is still feeling effects from Obama’s presidency. Stocks aren’t ‘soaring’ solely because of you, Ass Hat.
7321 2018-01-05 05:27:29 And how many of us have Stocks?

7323 2018-01-05 05:27:16 I don't think 'O' was really concerned with ratings and his numbers as you so much are. There's more things to be concerned about than ratings and numbers. Like homeless people drug addiction,  water contamination, environmental issues and Healthcare but go on about your stocks
7324 2018-01-05 05:27:06 I had stocks in NM and never had a wreck as long as the can move forward if they step off they handle it well do you have wide ones? Or just the standard

7328 2018-01-05 05:26:05 Like that guy said on there, what am I going to do with an extra 50M? I would say the worst thing to do is give it to the Govt. Buy 50M in real estate, develop land, invest in US stocks, buy vehicles. The #1 waster of money is the US Govt so do anything but give it to them.
7329 2018-01-05 05:25:50 Liberals hate high stocks and low unemployment. They hate homeless rates dropping and GDP nearly 4 percent. They hate when we stand up for ourselves in the world and don't send tax dollars to terrorist.
7330 2018-01-05 05:25:23 About half of Americans don't own stocks so this rally hasn't benefited them. Corporate tax cut will result in companies buying back stock and paying greater dividends which again doesn't benefit them. Exacerbates the gap between the rich and poor
7331 2018-01-05 05:25:19 Well the CEO did sell most his shares just before everything hit the news. Guess he's predicting the stocks to drop in value
7332 2018-01-05 05:25:17 This dude ryan didnt like arkham city because he wanted to manage stocks as bruce wayne lmaoooo
7333 2018-01-05 05:25:12 Let's see.. Stocks hit 25k and 250k new jobs reported... But this garbage is what you report on? 
7334 2018-01-05 05:25:05 You realize that most of us do not own enough stocks for this to even appear on our radars, right? Oh, yeah. #TrustFundDonnie
7335 2018-01-05 05:24:39 Stock market and economy growth have nothing to do with each other

High stocks usually means that the middle class is being screwed over

It usually also means that the market is overheating meaning that a crash or recession is imminent 

And BTW - You're going to prison

7347 2018-01-05 05:21:24 Who said that long term investors are immune?? Ask those who invested in RPOWER, SUZLON, GMR INFRA...etc back in 2006/07 ask how much money they made. It is not the duration, but quality of stocks. I see pretty much all stocks are streached beyond insanity and will collapse soon.
7348 2018-01-05 05:20:35 I know no "O". Neither does the rest of the world. O'Reilly? Omarosa? O dear God impeach Trump? You don't know it, but Stock Markets don't really impact the average citizen as they do NOT own stocks for starters. You can't even explain the impact of th Dow in everyday life. SAD!
7349 2018-01-05 05:19:57 I voted for him. I am a middle class American and yes I have stocks.  There are wise middle class  as well you know...
7350 2018-01-05 05:19:34 How do u set stop losses on coins?  Know how to on stocks....
7351 2018-01-05 05:19:00 Yes, us low lives are really happy breaking our back so the richer folks that own stocks can make even more money...just ask us....
7352 2018-01-05 05:17:35 No it is worth the stocks in that 401(k) account not the "stock market" unless it is invested in index funds.
7353 2018-01-05 05:17:12 Way more than 18%. Maybe not individual stocks, but stock expousre through etf, mutual funds, via their 401k, etc.
7354 2018-01-05 05:16:38 Not buying the giant pedo piece but some human trafficking people are in the group. They will be exposed. Most is money laundering and fraud. Some major stocks will get hurt and hurt the averages for awhile. Kill Trump plot will be exposed and have serious consequences.

7359 2018-01-05 05:14:54 This year is all about ownership. Owning property, owning stocks, owning up and taking responsibility..
7360 2018-01-05 05:14:37 You have to be patient and wait, I bought stocks at a lower price and eventually went up
7361 2018-01-05 05:14:34 They are using their product xRapid not the xrp token itself. Buying $XRP is basically buying stocks into a company yet you own no part of that company 
7362 2018-01-05 05:14:30 Look really bad for the Padres? Since when are premier players expected to sign with the Padres? We specialize is retreads and bargain deals. No glory in SD until the farm fully stocks the MLB roster. #Reality
7363 2018-01-05 05:14:16 Also shares are stocks. Nothing like coins. If I owned 51% of XRP it still gives me no say in anything ripple does

7367 2018-01-05 05:09:03 It does. Negatively. Stocks go up if companies make more profit. Companies make more profit by having less expenses. Like payroll, environmental protection, worker safety, product safety. So yeah, average Americans are affected...just not in a good way.
7368 2018-01-05 05:08:53 Looking over the charts tonight I feel like Weed stocks need to pull more and consolidate before another leg. If tomorrow is strong into the open Ill be taking even more profits

7370 2018-01-05 05:08:24 @kurteichenwald did you really sell all your stocks before Trump took office?
7371 2018-01-05 05:07:47 Not my stocks mine where down  because of what @jeffsessions said. #makehimtakeitback #WEEDSTOCKS
7372 2018-01-05 05:05:46 Wish I had the stats in my brain (saw it yesterday) but stocks are only owned by a tiny % of people in the US. Not relevant to most
7373 2018-01-05 05:04:50 I know nothing about stocks or what's so ever BUT I want invest my money anyone know any good stocks?
7374 2018-01-05 05:04:35 Rob just curious to your rage?  Under trump more than a million jobs have been created, lowest Hispanic unemployment ever, black unemployment at 17yr. Low, stocks over 25,000 and gdp over 3%. Why is this bad?
7375 2018-01-05 05:04:18 @ZeeBusiness Hi have HINDCOPPER 200 STOCKS bought at 99.8 for short term
7376 2018-01-05 05:04:09 Do accounts get their own HIN these days or are stocks still held in a custodian?
7377 2018-01-05 05:04:02 Work it out shit for brains. People despise you and everything your criminal family stand for. Nothing YOU have done in the past year explains the market uptick which in any case is global. Emerging market stocks outstripped the US or are you wanting credit for that too ?
7378 2018-01-05 05:03:53 Better to stops equity and balanced SIP. Don't blindly buy equity for long term argument. Shift to debt instruments for a year until earnings support. Don't call your mutual fund distribution he will say discipline blah.. Individual stocks is different game anyway..

7381 2018-01-05 05:03:14 @gtripathy66 some luck today as @manaluminim moves up 11%, and #Electrosteelseel bought again yesterday hits UC #stocks. The big one for me though is #Goodluck all the way #stocks
7382 2018-01-05 05:02:43 If that happens sell your stocks. Economy going into toilet
7383 2018-01-05 05:02:22 Sorry I must have been at the wrong meeting when we drafted the Strategic Fuel Policy which would nationalise all fuel stocks for usage by Defence. Senator Hill sponsored it & Prime Minister Howard approved it. This included all land, aviation, marine.
7384 2018-01-05 05:02:15 A record-setting period nearly unmatched in U.S. history. Yet throughout the surge in share prices, individual investors have continued to yank money out of funds that own U.S. stocks.
Nearly $1 trillion has been pulled from retail-investor mutual funds that target U.S.
