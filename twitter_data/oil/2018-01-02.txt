41 2018-01-02 23:57:12 They are disapearing due to automation,  cheaper prices for cleaner gas & oil & because of the Grifter attitude of coal country owners & politician. Trump demagogued that.
42 2018-01-02 23:56:53 I suppose to went to the DMV an got a oil change today i ain’t make it to na one lol
43 2018-01-02 23:56:51 I agree with you on that Canada is among the Top 5 oil producers in the world and any change to the oil market has an effect on your economy. Iran was the sixth biggest producer of oil in 2014, pumping 
3.4 m barrels per day; Canada produced an estimated 4.3 m barrels.
44 2018-01-02 23:56:34 Lil Oil Change

48 2018-01-02 23:55:56 Kaya did tit or tat and said the same thing the liberals said about the conservatives during the hurricanes.
49 2018-01-02 23:55:44 Free gas you say,lol  What did you have to do to get that hook up? lol they don't have you killing Afghanis refugees or oil tycoons or something?
50 2018-01-02 23:55:29 Is all of this gonna affect the oil prices?
51 2018-01-02 23:55:18 Davis needs a rearview mirror. When they were in power, they didn't look for efficiencies, they were preoccupied squandering the fast flowing oil money. We will be paying for their mismanagement for a very long time.
52 2018-01-02 23:55:17 전기 매트 고장났나봐... 심지어 셔플로 덩케 the  oil 나오는 중이라 뼈 속까지 시려온다. 제가 오늘 얼어 죽으면 덩케르크에 뿌려주세요. 파리어 내가 많이 사랑했다
53 2018-01-02 23:55:11 Fantasies are a great indicator to trade oil, good luck!
54 2018-01-02 23:55:08 This is the opposite of what will happen except silver and oil.

56 2018-01-02 23:55:05 Well we just witnessed an example of trolling, haven't we?
57 2018-01-02 23:55:01 then don't - they can easily get that support from China, or Russia, and you can take your bat and ball and go home
no more oil for you

62 2018-01-02 23:54:50 Bruh my nigga got ta shakin the oil like it was some fuckin season salt and started dying cause it was too strong 
63 2018-01-02 23:54:34 @bradmondonyc 
(Part 3) so it was in 2015 where I said I'm not going to dye it anymore and after a year of rubbing in eculyptus oil to help it which it did mixed with coconut oil. My hair grew stronger but it still looked sick so I went drastic and pretty much cut super short
64 2018-01-02 23:54:21 Unfortunately I agree Rob, this is exactly what I expect to happen.
65 2018-01-02 23:54:15 Lockheed Martin spends millions each year lobbying the US congress to oil the military machine with more funding.
66 2018-01-02 23:53:59 Kylos first oil change 
67 2018-01-02 23:53:58 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

70 2018-01-02 23:53:27 Or just paid oil money through his lobbying firm to discredit alternatives to fuel burning private vehicles.
71 2018-01-02 23:53:25 lol no, my mom just really likes fukin oil. Like i got an oil bracelet for xmas and im like i didn't ask for dis. But honestly i kinda likeit because im only into the peppermint oil. and like thats it.

2 cans garbanzo beans
1 teaspoon salt

Drain beans, save water.

Add tablespoon olive oil
Add 3 cloves garlic
Blend until smooth, add more water if necessary.

76 2018-01-02 23:52:54 It all fell under that agreement, did you not read the agreement?

It covered arms, banking, automobile industry, oil revenue ,frozen assets as well as investments! The biggest thing was Enrichment
77 2018-01-02 23:52:44 Coconut oil cures everything
78 2018-01-02 23:52:44 Do you add the stock gradually or all at once? Do you brown the rice a bit in the butter/oil before you add the liquid? I've never had trouble with it taking too long (twenty minutes max), more that I occasionally overcook it.

81 2018-01-02 23:51:52 Esen I'm no expert on the Middle East. The only thing I've unequivocally determined is that it is an intractable conflict zone. There's so many factions subfactions etc. Who could keep track? Maybe it's geographical, oil-related-beyond my ability to comprehend. #nolastingpeace
82 2018-01-02 23:51:51 I would like to rescind my Admiral Ackbar comment. I had ~1/15 stuck in my head as a top for oil, but after looking at a number of charts, I fully agree with a top being imminent (early next week). Oil is really disrespecting the cycles too. Let's light this sucker
83 2018-01-02 23:51:49 If you're going with roasting, I sprinkle on a tiny bit of brown sugar and black pepper. That gets it nicely carmelized with just a little kick from the pepper. Just toss in a little olive oil first.

88 2018-01-02 23:51:17 4. Most of Nigeria's power generation is from thermal power stations that require gas for fuel. The gas is produced by oil and gas companies overseen by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources.

90 2018-01-02 23:51:16 Once we have Iran's sunctions back in place then #crude will jump, potentially staying high for longer. If all out conflict erupts in Iran, entire region is a blow up and a bull case for crude. There is high chance of it IMHO
91 2018-01-02 23:51:02 That would further isolate the us internationally, Europe wouldn’t agree

110 2018-01-02 23:49:21 i regret asking u to explain urself but also using coconut oil before shaving prevents razor burn and moisturized u skin. it helps even more if u apply aloe vera gel afterwards to calm any skin irritation. hope this helps!

120 2018-01-02 23:48:07 I have found that there are usually multiple reasons for military intervention: looting a central bank's gold reserve is just one of them. Regarding Libya, there was also the French pushing to get the oil, and some more shadowy stuff related to Israel's dominance in the ME.
121 2018-01-02 23:48:03 Más protestas en Irán = más shale oil, ojala que además en reemplazo de la producción iraní
122 2018-01-02 23:47:43 Literally every other election we have is a popular vote. Are you saying if we add one more popular vote into the equation, 24 randoms would be sent to an island to kill each other? Huh?
123 2018-01-02 23:47:38 Idk about oil but I have had spaghetti, milk and sugar when I was a kid and it BANGED.
124 2018-01-02 23:47:34 Then close shop and look for other business, oil business should not be a do or die affair

126 2018-01-02 23:47:28 That’s called having huge oil reserves, the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world - and keeping it all to yourself.  All sorts of things become possible, but it’s hardly admirable.
127 2018-01-02 23:47:19 Today I got up early, got in a workout, went grocery shopping, meal prepped a week’s worth of lunches and dinners, cleaned my place, organized my room, and got my essential oil diffuser working. 2018 is mine

129 2018-01-02 23:46:56 What a nation Nigeria is? ls the money coming out of his personal pockets or taxpayers money  to pay personal hoodlums hired by state executive. River state had been turned into blood state rather than pumping oil and gas the state is now brooding hooligans.

135 2018-01-02 23:46:20 Oh, and sometimes we’re used for beauty, but only when our midnight-colored bodies are one tone, fetishized, & covered in oil.

140 2018-01-02 23:45:29 Is that the Northstar?
Docked in Inuvik during the summer?
So much hope and positivity back then for the project.
If so, I stayed on board in June one year for a week as the town hotels were so full during the Oil & Gas conference.
Nice digs!
141 2018-01-02 23:45:27 Revision of Iran sunctions is going to happen on January 12th and something tells me that @realDonaldTrump will put those sunctions on #crude exports back. I definitely see #Iran escalation happening, giving ground for Trump to put sunctions back on.

150 2018-01-02 23:44:24 i feel like an oil spill
151 2018-01-02 23:44:11 Diane. Well anyone I guess that thinks Kaya or Patricia are somehow connected to JV or possibly Left of center.  Girls with Guns don't have a liberal vibe.
152 2018-01-02 23:44:05 You don't know being an adult until 3 days after rent is due you have to fill your oil tank and it cost you 626 dollars and even after splitting that cost with your bf you have to pay 313 each 
153 2018-01-02 23:44:05 Peppermint is good for stomachs like mint tea or oil or maybe even candy idk
154 2018-01-02 23:43:50 He put baby oil on his bald head and .........
155 2018-01-02 23:43:41 just need to know why my father put coconut oil in my face mask

157 2018-01-02 23:43:10 We do live in America, right? Where we have the 1A. So if I want to give my opinion I will.
158 2018-01-02 23:42:55 If not, i'd recommend Bell's B finest cold drawn Castor oil. 5h max. You can get it in most mid - high range pharmacies.
159 2018-01-02 23:42:44 Having one of those days where I only crave for healthy foods or foods that have lesser oil content.  Why does my workplace have to be somewhere ulu.
160 2018-01-02 23:42:31 Will California’s next governor lead the transition to a clean energy future by prohibiting new oil and gas wells and fossil fuel infrastructure? #ECSummit26 @maryplummer @abc7marc

162 2018-01-02 23:42:24 Compare what you give Palestine to what you give Isryael and it's really just a piss in the ocean... Oil ocean, but nevertheless... Quit meddling.
163 2018-01-02 23:42:15 Trump's oil and coal company friends, supporters are destroying the air we all breathe with their pollution.
164 2018-01-02 23:42:09 Trying to find good natural hair products that don't have coconut oil has become an extreme sport 
165 2018-01-02 23:42:04 But low oil costs must be a factor too.
166 2018-01-02 23:41:39 แทบไม่อยากตื่น
167 2018-01-02 23:41:35 There Will Be Blood. But with more Force and less oil.
168 2018-01-02 23:41:32 That is Kaya's comparison in that tweet. Like tit for tat, they did it we can do it she is saying.
169 2018-01-02 23:41:04 @HouseofLifeLDN I bought your equalise anti wrinkle face oil at your stall at Spirit of Christmas. I have just started using it and it smells off, I bought other products and they all smell great. I have phoned and emailed, please will you get in touch.
170 2018-01-02 23:41:01 It wouldn't be shocking if WTI quickly spiked to 61, but then started to fall right after. Fundamentally WTI had no business being here. Ill wait 2 months from now to tell you where it'll be in 2 months.
171 2018-01-02 23:40:53 "Because calling it oil would be confusing."
172 2018-01-02 23:40:44 What the USA has oil!
173 2018-01-02 23:40:43 It appears that here it's rapeseed oil, however is rapeseed really a vegetable? I think not.
174 2018-01-02 23:40:40 And your response to your puppet master providing N Korea with oil by mid-ocean tanker transfers?....Further proving your allegiance to mother russia, and not the US, so sad, pitiful, prison-bound US leadership.
175 2018-01-02 23:40:22 You stole my lamp oil AND my rupees!
Bombs is all i have!
176 2018-01-02 23:40:18 Tell Russia to stop sending North Korea oil
177 2018-01-02 23:40:14 If you can afford it, I'd recommend Sunny Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil.. It's really pricey.
178 2018-01-02 23:40:11 does she have a starter kit? if she purchases a kit, my mom is doing like a new year bonus where she’s buying people who get kits a bottle of oil that isn’t included in the kit up to $25
179 2018-01-02 23:40:09 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
180 2018-01-02 23:40:06 coconut oil has solved 97% of my life problems, i swear it could even make my bank account go back to what it was before christmas
181 2018-01-02 23:39:56 Huh?  Do you have dementia or something?  How in Gods name do you find ANY parallel's with this tweet and the looney bin left??  Are you sure you are not an infiltrator? Your opinion you should keep to yourself. JS.  
182 2018-01-02 23:39:32 paige literally dropped slime on a pile of my oil pastels and that shit got Stuck
183 2018-01-02 23:39:23 Yep. I usually use a cream based cleanser in the AM, and double cleanse at night with an oil cleanser then a flaming cleanser.
184 2018-01-02 23:39:18 Our Middle-East policy is about one thing only: easy, cheap access to oil. To further that goal we support any despot no matter how brutal, install puppet regimes in other countries as we did in Iran, and believe the people there aren't intelligent enough to notice or remember.
185 2018-01-02 23:39:14 I have no idea why he was calling or talking to the russians for the trump campaign. My guess would be the word sanctions and oil were repeated in the conversation though.
186 2018-01-02 23:39:01 tea tree oil is the most baller cure for everything
187 2018-01-02 23:38:56 You keep moving your goal posts from taxation to regulation. Capex in oil and gas is down globally.
188 2018-01-02 23:38:54 be honest, we are only there for poppy plant production and their oil.
189 2018-01-02 23:38:49 Aloe vera and vitamin e oil has my skin on glo, I’m in awe 
190 2018-01-02 23:38:42 The problem was an award to a political dissident as I recall. Why don't EFTA deals count? They sell their gas, oil and fish independently so can we.
191 2018-01-02 23:38:35 I think Iranians will need outside help to overthrow a well armed regime funded with billions of dollars of oil money. The US stands to benefit economically and geopolitically if the mullahs were out of power. Indeed, it would be a dramatic game changer.
192 2018-01-02 23:38:34 If you’re up for a more religious video, I’d love to hear about that bible that was discovered to be continuously leaking oil! I find it really interesting and it would be cool to hear your opinions on if it’s real or what you think could be causing it :)

196 2018-01-02 23:38:14 Bless the eighteen people who took the onus upon themselves to review cooking oil.
197 2018-01-02 23:38:08 Seems like #oil #natgas producers are looking out and not drilling themselves into a Bolivian. The weather is sure helping them with that as well. Mother Nature slows production.
198 2018-01-02 23:38:08 Oil
199 2018-01-02 23:38:01 And you must stay away as you criminally destroyed an upcoming Iranian democracy for the sake of oil.
200 2018-01-02 23:37:53 @DGodfatherMoody Bold prediction or pipe dream, UNCLE BRENNIE TAKES BEARD OIL TO V L at Daytona500.

205 2018-01-02 23:37:14 it's scary I swr
206 2018-01-02 23:37:10 I recently read we should reheat them in a frying pan in a little oil. Anyone tried that? #isavefriestoo
207 2018-01-02 23:37:02 I think it's like lotion or oil or something just to spice it up. but I'm Asian so I rather just put water
208 2018-01-02 23:36:53 don't forget about that oil spill
209 2018-01-02 23:36:29 AT LEAST YOU DIDNT MAKE PUFF PASTRY AT 11:30 PM LIKE I DID ONCE BUT REALIZED TOO LATE YOU DIDNT HAVE ANY BUTTER SO RESORTED TO SUBSTITUTING WITH COCONUT OIL AND THEN IT BEING TO BRITTLE ONCE IT BAKED AND SPENT 5 HOURS BAKING FOR ONE (1) PASTRY TO ALMOST WORK
210 2018-01-02 23:36:12 I have epsom salt and now extra virgin coconut oil. Let the diy bath products commence.
211 2018-01-02 23:36:11 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
212 2018-01-02 23:36:10 ...because Fracking is so safe...except the explosion of earthquakes in earthquake prone sates like Oklahoma, and those little inconveniences like methane pollution and groundwater pollution...line those oil company pockets
213 2018-01-02 23:36:06 I think the oil could be on fire and we’d still have school somehow
214 2018-01-02 23:35:54 How do I respond when the guy who’s changing my oil says he likes my nails
215 2018-01-02 23:35:48 If you want to keep a 'head' on your beer, avoid snacks. Oil coatings on nuts, for example, transfers from your lips to your beer. Oil makes foam bubbles burst, therefore the head on your beer will disperse as you eat snacks = flat beer.
216 2018-01-02 23:35:48 I’m @ Toyota getting a oil change and this guy that works here kept eyeing me and found my insta and idk if I should be worried
217 2018-01-02 23:35:36 Thanks for the explicit details. I think I would go with coaster oil. I prefer natural products and I just read a lot of bad reviews on Dr. Miracles.
218 2018-01-02 23:35:06 I do have some oil of oregano that stuff does taste nasty just had chicken noodle soup now i'm downing some warm beef broth

222 2018-01-02 23:33:49 And an Olive Oil Tasting Session or course to make it full of vitamins!
223 2018-01-02 23:33:43 IT SMELLS GREASY AF. I PUT SO MUCH FREAKING OIL INTO THE BATTER IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY ANYMORE
224 2018-01-02 23:33:30 Where do you see crude being at within 3 months? I think all the bad things such as geopolitics and pipeline disraptions are priced in already. Even though not everyone agrees.
225 2018-01-02 23:33:12 I’m bout to start making this weed oil and butter and it’s really gone be over
226 2018-01-02 23:33:12 Why did I think it was a good idea to put coconut oil in my hair at midnight?? Now I’m too sleepy to wash my hair but I have to. 
227 2018-01-02 23:33:09 oil actually :-) baby oil :-)
228 2018-01-02 23:32:17 They can make fun of my fixtures, but I'm taking my oil rubbed bronze and crystal doorknobs with me. lol
229 2018-01-02 23:31:48 We are oil drunkards and the Saudi Arabia is our bartender.
230 2018-01-02 23:31:45 My apartment currently smells like a weird combo of the lavender essential oil I have in the diffuser and the turkey burger I cooked for lunch

233 2018-01-02 23:31:26 Phooey!  Gargle oil of oregano? :) or drink it with water/juice if you don't mind the taste?
234 2018-01-02 23:31:26 Great pickup, Bev. Mining alt-media the only way to hear about Trump's scores on the board.

The new oil finds should power the grid so all those #SJWs can tool around in their electric cars :-))))
235 2018-01-02 23:31:26 Essentially anything derived from a plant they call vegetable oil

243 2018-01-02 23:30:45 They should sell it under the name of "soy oil" then.

Or "soil" for short.
244 2018-01-02 23:30:36 Here's C/ we have a dangerous precedent where the US decides whether there is a need for military intervention and for how long. They answer to no body while they carry it out and if don't destroy the country they get to control that nations oil reserves. This is empire.
245 2018-01-02 23:30:34 Castor oil has a smell but itsss littyyyy
246 2018-01-02 23:30:33 Nobody wants no snake oil salesman especially one named @MittRomney
247 2018-01-02 23:30:19 OIL DIFF: 6.34 -> 6.42
248 2018-01-02 23:30:06 Flashback to the time when the guy that was changing my oil was so cute that when I nervously pulled out I side swept the rear of my car and drove away acting like I wasn't crying on the inside. It's all been downhill since
249 2018-01-02 23:29:58 Who'd have imaged? Cannabis oil infused tequila and face cream are here. The face cream is over 50% cocoa butter. What a great idea!
250 2018-01-02 23:29:57 i had to pop out the coconut oil today, im fuckin dying
251 2018-01-02 23:29:55 Use cold and hot compress alternately then some eucalyptus oil on your butt. Hope that helps! get well soon!
252 2018-01-02 23:29:48 You are the savior!  You are right up there with Jesus H Christ. This year you can focus on oil sills and hurricanes. I know u have it in you
253 2018-01-02 23:29:47 Few minutes to coat and heat oil and about 3 minutes in the hot canola oil
254 2018-01-02 23:29:46 85 percent of what’s labeled vegetable oil in the United States is pure soybean oil
255 2018-01-02 23:29:42 Never mind fixed it! In other news, cut my hand on my olive oil label (hard plastic) 2 days before MAG.
256 2018-01-02 23:29:36 But Russians are supplying refined oil products so that the sanctions dont sting! And one solder making a dash for the border does not demonstrate a collapse of North Korea. Probably just a kimchi shortage!
257 2018-01-02 23:29:25 i need another 170 dollars worth of materials for my oil painting class and my dad was already pissed that my other books cost 200
258 2018-01-02 23:28:50 At least it show the infiltrators what they’re up against.
259 2018-01-02 23:28:49 So tired of eating “food I eat when I’m sick” kinda food. I want food on a plate. Like a medium well filet cooked in olive oil, kosher salt, black pepper, fresh garlic w/ mashed bourbon butter sweet potatoes and garlic and herb steamed broccoli with a Chianti Classico goddamn.
260 2018-01-02 23:28:48 Yeah.. castor oil works too if you prefer a more natural, oil-based method. You have to be careful not to overdo it tho.
261 2018-01-02 23:28:45 We should not give money to counties that execute people for sorcery... but i guess they have oil. So here we are...
262 2018-01-02 23:28:36 YOUR CAR HAS WATER AND OIL. AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR ENGINE IS NOT RUNNING?? It SITS ON THE BOTTOM. IT'S BAD FOR YOUR CAR TO NOT WARM IT UP.
263 2018-01-02 23:28:16 No I wouldn't even flinch  I was gonna say that in my previous tweet, but then I was like wait once again I'm devoting way too much energy to this situation. So I hit send I put my phone down and I inhaled my balancing oil. I'm exhausted just thinking about it
264 2018-01-02 23:28:14 The same is true of more solar / wind / natural gas. Oil seems the worse choice amongst these choices.
265 2018-01-02 23:28:13 Do they ever specify which vegetables are used for vegetable oil?
266 2018-01-02 23:28:06 Lucas oil racing tv does it close to right. 100 bucks for a year and you get live events and replays of mavtv events.

273 2018-01-02 23:26:45 It’s sad that you think Republicans give a shit about small business people. They use them as pawns just like they do not care about the troops except as cannon fodder to steal oil for Exxon & as props for their next political campaign. Then they cut Veterans benefits.

279 2018-01-02 23:25:50 The only annoying thing is that my hg hair oil has to be shipped from Australia 
280 2018-01-02 23:25:40 It is rationed care, neither free nor better.

I bought her a Moroccan oil hair product that was meant for her curls, hugely expensive, and she used it to rub on her legs in the tub 2 years ago and the student from Turkey living with us slipped and broke his finger and the tub!!

291 2018-01-02 23:24:28 Because the other "major" European sides play in the UCL consistently & / or have oil money behind them. #LFC don't. We have to make do, until these "elite" players win us a title or two & we can begin competing, until then sack up & shut up.
292 2018-01-02 23:24:27 I've a suspicion the 1Q 2018 roll out of a CNY oil futures contract may be the key. *IF* the CL/CNY contract is largely ignored from the get go, I'd expect the $USDJPY to threaten 120 again. OTOH, if the CL/CNY contract attracts significant interest, I predict $USDJPY < 103.

299 2018-01-02 23:23:40 First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  or Body Shop's Vitamin E Serum in Oil!
Both work wonders for me when I get dry skin

301 2018-01-02 23:23:14 I hate how Jamaican black castor oil smells like straight smoke but damn it works wonders for my hair 
302 2018-01-02 23:22:58 Fav oil??
303 2018-01-02 23:22:49 That’s true, tbh if I did do contracts on this cycle I would have been wiped out, I’m still learning valuable lessons 
304 2018-01-02 23:22:48 i left my palette with saran wrap on it (very badly) for 2 whole weeks and the paint is still usable oil paints are the work of the devil i tell u
305 2018-01-02 23:22:44 Looks more like a oil industry Texan to me... Yeehaw! *Randomly shoots two hand guns up into the air while feverishly stamping his feet side to side.*
306 2018-01-02 23:22:39 My four year old is teaching my 30 year old wife to make “Mamaw Ruth’s Cornbread” like no ingredients list or measurements...just my 4 year old saying “when” on buttermilk, oil, etc
307 2018-01-02 23:22:37 Just like @realDonaldTrump thinks that we should have taken all the oil in Iraq he doesn't comprehend that the Iran money we returned was their funds in our financial institutions we confiscated.

320 2018-01-02 23:21:03 It will be interesting to see how the north pans out. I remember Erdogan's son-in-law being accused of getting a share of the ISIS oil, the mass convoys to and from Turkey, the medical aid to ISIS, and then the shooting down of the Russian jet: how did the US force Turkey?
321 2018-01-02 23:20:56 Yeah that huge oil leak sure was great wasn't it
322 2018-01-02 23:20:47 Oil cans picture speaks volumes...

325 2018-01-02 23:20:43 I buy Chilean olive oil.
326 2018-01-02 23:20:41 before it hits the pan, btw. i suggest marinating in olive oil+garlic powder+onion powder--soy sauce too, in this case)
once in the pan, i suggest flipping the pieces you have once. if you're unsure if it's cooked all the way, clean your scissors and cut a chunk in half
327 2018-01-02 23:20:37 Ahhhh, poor Kermit!! Is he a closet Liberal?!?!
328 2018-01-02 23:20:37 Don’t let them fool you! Putin, Xi and Kim Jong are in this together....Xi supplies oil to NK. And Putin needs Xi from an economic standpoint
329 2018-01-02 23:20:30 I've just never understood.why we have a federal body govern provincial waters. We managed to strike the Atlantic Accord for oil, I think the.same should be.lobbied by provincial government
330 2018-01-02 23:20:28 I was looking specifically at the roasted Brussels Sprouts, which listed basting oil as an ingredient, which had different ingredient lists than the current basting oil (soybean vs. Sunflower).
331 2018-01-02 23:20:25 With this crazy storm coming, I cant wait to order my cbd oil products... I jsut hope they get shipped fast!!
332 2018-01-02 23:20:19 Way to go Jason. You should have made your video a week ago when big oil raised gas prices by 12 cents in one night. You could have saved $11.00 on your  fill up.
333 2018-01-02 23:20:18 Newsweek is Izlammick propaganda, oil money.

338 2018-01-02 23:19:25 Again if we want to have economic debate we need data and at least objective truth. When did ride happen and what is the portion of trade surplus attributable to? Simple answers - you produced more oil due to quiet Niger Delta and price rose from $38 to $58. Rocket science?
339 2018-01-02 23:19:22 @abuaardvark 
Well IMHO #SaudiArabia should have #IPO’ed #ARAMCO years ago. Now it’s a future #SunkenAsset since 80% of all #oil should remain in the ground.
340 2018-01-02 23:19:19 My New Years resolution is to take the things I normally put off and do them every single day of 2018:
1. Get my oil changed
2. Buy stamps 
3. Pay rent
4. Die
5. Shave my legs
341 2018-01-02 23:19:16 Went to my job orientation, got my oil changed, dropped off my grandma's bday card, now making dinner before going to the gym. Productive mood all of 2018

343 2018-01-02 23:19:13 Maybe the Italian "olive" oil producers were giving them tips.
344 2018-01-02 23:19:08 Guess this yr I need to be on that Jamaican black castor oil cause I’m not statisfied with my length. My 1 yr no heat journey about to be up in 5 months

357 2018-01-02 23:17:46 @nhpr whats up w/ oil companies refusing to deliver oil? Mine wass"too busy" to deliver so I ran out last night. My neighbors can't get a delivery until Thursday, and a friend up north can't get one until the 14th!  I'm getting by with 5 gallon gerry cans from the Irving station.
358 2018-01-02 23:17:43 OMG I tried this one that made me feel like I dipped my body in olive oil, it was bad.

360 2018-01-02 23:17:42 As I open my mouth to whine abt how cold it is in my house right now, how the flippers lied abt the extra insulation & good ductwork, I realize that I at least have a home. I can afford to heat it, even tho that means using a combo of electric and oil. I worry for those who lack.
361 2018-01-02 23:17:42 All I was saying is that you weren’t making a very good case for home schooling.  I was speaking from experience with children who have been home-schooled. Do you diffuse your own oil? I love lavender too.

I'd ask a patient take that first than any pharmaceutical. For the most part in certain situations...
366 2018-01-02 23:16:48 A short story : valvoline put oil in my transmission fluid and my transmission blew , don't go there 
367 2018-01-02 23:16:43 It amazes me how Clerics in Iran can blame people overseas for their massive short commings ie 40% unemployment in men under 30 , no job no prospects , abject poverty , while these arses spend all the oil money , no wonder they are pissed
368 2018-01-02 23:16:37 Oh god, someone at the place I’m getting an oil change at put the TV on Big Bang Theory, I think I might be in hell.
369 2018-01-02 23:16:33 I WONT be coming back to jiffy lube. They’re expensive as hell. I’ll stick to Valvoline for my oil changes

373 2018-01-02 23:15:54 Good that counting America generosity but failing to indicate how much have America n American companies exploited n stolen from other countries in human n natural resources. Eg: Liberia  US stole rubber for cheap n iron ore for cheap, Arab oil , niger uranium, slavery
374 2018-01-02 23:15:42 Today going to get my oil changed today..
Employee: "your oil was dangerously low."
Me: ".. I'm sorry."
375 2018-01-02 23:15:37 olive oil?? it froze olive oil??? i didn't think that was possible!
376 2018-01-02 23:15:25 Trump wants war with Iran. He wants their oil. It's that simple. He doesn't give a damn about anyone's human rights. Supporting protestors? Really that's laughable. Lindsay Graham too
377 2018-01-02 23:15:25 まあね
378 2018-01-02 23:15:17 I need an oil change

380 2018-01-02 23:14:56 He sold out Utah's most treasured & sacred national monument lands to be drilled & fracked by the oil & gas industry. Got a kickback for doing that too. Oh yes he did. Nothing to be proud of here.

388 2018-01-02 23:13:22 You are being very unfair!   The US Government is very concerned about human rights in any country that doesn't have US Companies controlling the oil industry!

394 2018-01-02 23:13:01 Had a seaweed face mask on and took it off with some cleansing oil and somehow how it ended up in my mouth and I swear I have never tasted something SO bad. I still haven't recovered from being murdered this morning tbh today is NOT my day
395 2018-01-02 23:13:00 According to All rubber chickens in my community @realDonaldTrump  is selling snake oil.

403 2018-01-02 23:12:10 I have the olive oil rub all ready....
404 2018-01-02 23:11:56 not mine, but a friend's. Her furnace went out and it was 29 degrees in the house. Olive oil, humidifier, etc... frozen solid. Thankfully everything is fixed now!
405 2018-01-02 23:11:26 Once you accept that #Trump has no morals, the majority of his decisions make so much more since.

Protesters get crushed harder because of direct US rhetoric, more reason to rail against Iran. Provoke a war in the middle East? No more enemies, or civilians, new US oil resources!

407 2018-01-02 23:11:17 Twitter lost my reply.   You made me LOL.  Also please tell Pat to message me about the beard oil, as I am curious.   Finally, loved the star leggings in the photo of Ryan.

414 2018-01-02 23:10:53 @WMUR9 if I heard your report correctly, due to the cold, there was a driver working for an oil delivery service that worked 22 hours straight? I think there may be a story behind that. Like why is someone who worked 22 hours driving a 318,000 metric ton explosive? #NH

416 2018-01-02 23:10:48 So what school did you go to that taught you to deny science that a small oil leak on a wind turbine is a bigger threat then a small leak in a pipeline? Where did you learn math 100 liters of oil is less than 800,000 liters of oil. Did you learn common sense we can't drink oil?
417 2018-01-02 23:10:35 The areas that burned were not LA or San Francisco. We just had the largest fire in state history. Lots of rural areas burned. A fireman died fighting the fires.

419 2018-01-02 23:10:24 All I did was open the bag of frozen sprouts, toss them with a little olive oil, salt and pepper, and roast them for about half an hour at 400°.

423 2018-01-02 23:09:40 Thank you, but I was fully aware of the obvious difference. The vile mess that I acquired for my visitor was based on coconut oil, smelled of rotten orange, and when sliced thinly rejoined. Never again.
424 2018-01-02 23:09:35 While he crushes dissent at home, fascist U.S. war chieftain Donald #Trump supports protesters in #Iran - only because he wants a pretext to steal their oil. #ImpeachTrumpNow #politics #NoBloodForOil #uspoli #DumpTrump
425 2018-01-02 23:09:18 Even just 20 years ago, Iran imported most of its gasoline. Today, gasoline imports r just around 15% of total gasoline consumption due 2 IRI's heavy investment in oil refineries & making Iran self-reliant, & trade partners like India & China continue 2 help Iran in this endeavor
426 2018-01-02 23:09:16 I don’t wish injury one anyone, but to the person drilling for oil in the common wall in the apartment next door without notice, I hope you tear both your rotator cuffs and break a clavicle, you unfathomably selfish ass-hat.

436 2018-01-02 23:07:48 Her tweet is still wrong. I know lots of good people in California.
437 2018-01-02 23:07:36 If she ran out of oil, it will have to be restarted/line bled. Hopefully someone knew that or oil company restarted it.
438 2018-01-02 23:07:33 Hmm...lard or olive oil???

444 2018-01-02 23:07:05 the uk doesn't support violent regimes, apart from pumping money into the pockets of Rwandan president Paul Kagame, who is arming a genocidal rebellion in the eastern Congo, and supporting the violent Kazakhstani dictatorship because of oil and trade opportunities
445 2018-01-02 23:07:01 Told you... they are so deep in debt they give up 2/3 oil production to Russia and China.
446 2018-01-02 23:07:00 Jamaican black castor oil really A1 for the beard
447 2018-01-02 23:06:52 @cultcommoncore really? It is still under fed control only to sell now to highest bidder. Screw all the wildlife that was protected because of it lets drill for oil as well as alaska. While at it lets put an oil rig in your back yard Trump followers are #twatwaffles

449 2018-01-02 23:06:25 Trump wants robbed their oil and make it like Iraq
450 2018-01-02 23:06:11 Not the lifting or anything... all muscle stems from fish oil and multivitamins
451 2018-01-02 23:06:05 We had a reporter stop by this afternoon and apparently heating oil has been delivered.
452 2018-01-02 23:05:59 I got a massage chair, big hands, and oil...that’s all I can offer my shorty...
453 2018-01-02 23:05:39 Medications like antihistamines and decongestants are used to cure this "dry nose" 
You can also create a humid environment
Go to a sauna (god *nose for how long lol)
Keep hydrated
Use nasal sprays
Apply sesame oil
Use coconut oil

454 2018-01-02 23:05:29 may nag chat sa gc. "sino mayda oil pastil?" koyaaa anuna na? HAHAHAHAHAHA
455 2018-01-02 23:05:29 I put thieves oil under my arms before bed last night... I’ve never had something burn so bad wow don’t do that
456 2018-01-02 23:05:25 Milking all of these poor fish for their oil... fucking capitalists!!!
457 2018-01-02 23:05:21 The oil field company I work for gave us a bonus, and now in May will start offering us a 401k.
458 2018-01-02 23:05:14 Certainly, but bear in mind fossil fuel is an exhaustible resource whereas renewables aren't.  Some forecasts have oil reserves not lasting beyond 2050.
459 2018-01-02 23:05:05 Do you remember the public discussion about car industry, health industry, oil industry, energy industry? Me neither.
A bunch of the "participation" looks like a protection racket: look, nice tech company you have here, would be such a shame if something were to happen to it...
460 2018-01-02 23:04:55 Fish oil?? That’s a banned substance if you’re a vegan sweetie.....
461 2018-01-02 23:04:55 People in the Naples area...
There will be no more propane deliveries out of Dodge oil tonight.
Dispensaries are empty.
462 2018-01-02 23:04:52 Snake oil exists WITH FDA approval. Homeopathy. Regulation also wastes time.

Harmful poison is already illegal. If someone is going to sell it they're going obey FDA laws?!?

Any supposed additional testing done by goverment regulations can be done better privately.
463 2018-01-02 23:04:44 @JNJNews Wondering why you use Parabens in you Aveeno Active Naturals products. I found it in your Creamy Moisterizing Oil. Was my favourite hand cream, but parabens are hormone disrupters & new study has linked them to certain types of cancer. So why would you use them? Curious!
464 2018-01-02 23:04:35 Bragging about a Float celebrating a Marsh Preserve in a city with one of the worst Oil Refineries in the nation. It’s suffered numerous explosions and spews toxic fumes continuously. #ShutItDown
465 2018-01-02 23:04:32 Facebook and Apple are building data-centers in Denmark because we have so much green energy. One of the biggest wind turbine manufacturers in the world, Vestas, is from Denmark and reading news about inflated oil prices to keep that industry going is an amusing read 
466 2018-01-02 23:04:30 Being delayed at Chicago Midway Airport is like the time your mom made you hang out the rundown mall with the off-brand food court because she had a coupon for the Sears Auto oil change.
467 2018-01-02 23:04:17 @MorganWABI What a wonderful assignment. You feel for the oil dealers being non stop. How many times did the phone went off during the interview with receptionist? You look great in the hat..

469 2018-01-02 23:03:57 I regularly put oil on my nails/cuticles and use lots of hand cream - think I need something stronger at the moment though
470 2018-01-02 23:03:38 wash your face with a water-based cleanser to whisk away any remaining residue and impurities from your oil cleanse

472 2018-01-02 23:03:11 I'm making a cologne called Midnight Oil and no one can stop me
473 2018-01-02 23:02:53 Obviously having a literal oil well topping the petty cash up has come in handy for Man City.

478 2018-01-02 23:02:36 Don't disagree BUT to be fair, we haven't been transitioning slowly, we haven't been doing it at all. Scheer is wrong here, investment just isn't down in Canada, it's everywhere. Global companies are cutting back everywhere and let's face-it oil sands are high production cost
479 2018-01-02 23:02:32 Was there an oil spill at the Man City game tonight! Lots of empty seats from the new Chel$ki billionaires! #MOTD #MOTD2
480 2018-01-02 23:02:27 Do you know all there is to know? Heard from a pharmacist friend you can legally sell cannabis oil made from hemp? Curious myself...
481 2018-01-02 23:02:12 i can't believe i forgot to bring the oil to town so i could GET MY OIL CHANGED 
482 2018-01-02 23:02:09 Jan. 2-2018 - #HappyNewYear2018  - $USO 12.07 close - holds up trend from Oct. break out. #OIL - Is it @realDonaldTrump #Economic rally or the #Cold #Weather or #IranProtests or because of Justin Timberlake
483 2018-01-02 23:02:08 Kaya Jones jumped on the #metoo bandwagon also. Where are all the names of abusers she said she had? Or is Kaya doing the Meryl Streep thing, #SheKnew and said nothing? Is she letting the abusers go on to abuse again?
484 2018-01-02 23:01:52 Thought.  Trump looking to stoke war in Iran, get US involved.  Try to go in and "take the oil".  #thebeat
485 2018-01-02 23:01:51 US shale grew this past year. It's the same players so they are just curing operating expenses? As you state, oil sands is expensive so extra regulations and taxes in conjunction with limited access to shipping to foreign markets make Canada's largest industry undesirable.
486 2018-01-02 23:01:43 Tractor Vapourizing Oil?
487 2018-01-02 23:01:39 More oil production = more spills = more environmental damage. More oil production = more CO2 emissions through combustion = accelerated climate change. #renewables
488 2018-01-02 23:01:13 Oil lube service is so good im laughing a lot but I also want to slap jimin
489 2018-01-02 23:01:01 Does this mean less oil usage in cooking?!  give me a proper review in a month or so and I may do the purchase too!
490 2018-01-02 23:00:57 Rt now I’m using herbivore orchid oil that I got in a small roller bottle.
491 2018-01-02 23:00:57 i'm actually trying so hard not to bite my nails to the point my cuticles and lips and skin are suffering 

whacking out the cuticle oil, hand cream and lip balm to make everything slippery
492 2018-01-02 23:00:53 Coconut oil!!!!!!!!!
493 2018-01-02 23:00:51 OIL SPILL NEWS:  Walked into a restaurant and ordered a ham sandwich and a glass of water.  The Waitress asked "Do you want a Light or Dark Water?"
494 2018-01-02 23:00:46 unless you find the cosmetic grade of coconut oil than you’re okay to use that kind but 100% coconut oil won’t work well if that makes sense
495 2018-01-02 23:00:43 It's the nerves you want to look after. My suggestions for mostly when the cast comes off. Castor oil, castor oil, castor oil. I swear by it. Google it. It soothes skin, muscle & nerve & expedites healing. Also, a homeopathic ointment called Trauma Care.

499 2018-01-02 23:00:31 OIL DIFF: 6.41 -> 6.46
500 2018-01-02 23:00:31 You need to understand our power grid & what it can & cant handle b4 u jump on that bandwagon with no knowledge. I think we can handle a possible oil spill. Would you rather we stay dependant on the ME for survival? Its dangerous to have to kiss ass to ppl who'd rather kill us
501 2018-01-02 23:00:25 Productive day  got my oil changed,  unpacked all my vacation stuff, did laundry, grocery shopped, put away all Christmas decor, and cleaned my house. Winninggggg  next week, baby prep 
502 2018-01-02 23:00:06 But it's okay to give/sell the Saudis millions of dollars worth of guns and oil profits so that they can build Islamist mosques and train in the Philippines, Indonesia, all across Europe and maybe even in the US for all we know.   Who is funding terrorism?............
503 2018-01-02 23:00:04 Trump and Truth. Like oil and water.

507 2018-01-02 22:59:41 I don't believe this number but I do think Cruz will win in TX.  The oil people love him.  Moore barely lost in AL and he's a pedophile.  Didn't Moore get about 85% of the republican vote? If Moore hadn't wanted to go back to slavery, the black women may not had been so vocal.
508 2018-01-02 22:59:19 Her olive oil was frozen solid too. 29 degrees in her house after the furnace went out.

510 2018-01-02 22:58:41 What I thought doing whole30 with my mom would be like: wholesome mother daughter fun

511 2018-01-02 22:58:16 the problem is palm oil
it's bad for the planet and bad for your system.
512 2018-01-02 22:58:12 A BIG question for Trump. Why hasn't he signed and authorized the sanctions against Russia that were due to kick in 10/1/17? At the same time he's not condemning Putin for sending oil to North Korea. With these actions he only appears to be a monumental puppet of Russia.
513 2018-01-02 22:57:58 متاكده ان فيصل وجابر من المراكز الثالث بس تصويت يمكن يقلب نسبه ۲۰ كبيره وتفرق نتمنى يلغى عشان الي من برا م ينظلمو وصل لسامي تكفى
514 2018-01-02 22:57:55 Google Sheets :) I have a calendar reminder to note my bike mileage at the end of every month. I only record the car mileage when I take it in for an oil change or other service.
515 2018-01-02 22:57:48 White noise headphones? Or is that not appropriate for work?

Maybe focus on stimulating a different sense positively - a feelgood scent you could breathe in (like an aromatherapy oil) or textured item you could hold?
516 2018-01-02 22:57:36 Yeees Sis I’m getting back on my shit  & I just told he checking this oil for his mom hold on Bin Laden 
517 2018-01-02 22:57:33 The truly mind boggling part is the hundreds of millions of dollars these companies spend to fully reclaim the land to return it to its natural state as it was before. The difference being there will be more more oil in the ground to seep into rivers.
518 2018-01-02 22:57:33 This year i hope that a lot of you start employing the idea of self love in your lives.

Like get your rose water, get that coconut oil, get your moisturization on, get your glow up

Like live healthy nigga
519 2018-01-02 22:57:18 Question is does ANYWHERE serve #glutenfree chips cooked in beef dripping for those who prefer to avoid sunflower oil?
520 2018-01-02 22:56:31 A BIG question for you Don. Why haven't you signed and authorized the sanctions against Russia that were due to kick in 10/1/17? At the same time you're not getting on Putin about sending oil to North Korea. With these actions you appear to be a monumental puppet of Russia.
521 2018-01-02 22:56:19 pessoal que tem problema com oleosidade e/ou acne, se vocês tiverem que escolher um óleo pra passar no rosto (sim, pra quem tem pele oleosa é um tratamento e tanto, inclusive oil cleansing é indicado principalmente pra esse tipo de pele), escolham óleo de jojoba!!!

525 2018-01-02 22:56:11 use castor oil it’s more efficient because coconut oil puts a coat over your hair instead of actually penetrating into the hair it sits on top of it which will not effect your hair at any point

528 2018-01-02 22:55:33 Y por qué está tan de moda Porfirio Díaz y su "obra" entre los Panistas? Será que se les olvidó Itrubide?
529 2018-01-02 22:55:30 Getting my own oil changed for the first time. Not because I never knew how or was afraid to, but because id never held onto a car long enough to need one. Thanks 2017.
530 2018-01-02 22:55:25 He has yet to implement the Russian sanctions.  He has yet to chastise Russia as he did China for supplying oil to North Korea. Am I going insane? Russia owns his ass
531 2018-01-02 22:55:04 FTSE100 growth is driven by oil and mining companies listed on in FTSE with profits made outside UK. This is fact. As for jobs growth how many are permanent full-time jobs?
532 2018-01-02 22:54:58 3 years dating a mechanic. overloaded with facts about vehicles, being shown over and over again how to perform simple tasks like checking the oil and filling the tires. yet now I'm on my own, second guessing everything I've been taught and feeling really stupid lol #needanewcar
533 2018-01-02 22:54:57 Our CLP and Ctax is exactly what is driving our economy and oil industry. Kenney’s plans would dry up investment and his job killing cuts and austerity would make things even worse than they were under Drunken Ralph. Wake up!
534 2018-01-02 22:54:36 #OIL = the ONLY direct Link to Consumer INFLATION drivers = Work Travel expenses + Transportation Industry Costs = Logistics 
Other Metals including #Gold  have Minimal impacts on Manufacturing Costs and Vital Consumer goods Inflation
$OIL at $60 =No threat to Inflation
535 2018-01-02 22:54:30 actually Don, Russia sells them oil, Russia gave them tips on how to deal with you. Your Putin is friends with Kimmy.
536 2018-01-02 22:54:14 Same here I use the same strategy for oil, hold a bullish long term position but trade the short term swings. Great way to stay non biased and it also helps me time my longer term adds
537 2018-01-02 22:53:43 Differing tale of two Portuguese flair players tonight. Cav purring like a finely tuned Aston Martin, Costa looking like he needs an oil change #wwfc
538 2018-01-02 22:53:36 You can get air at great Canadian oil change as well :)
539 2018-01-02 22:53:24 Do you think you would have said this in 1953 when the Americans overthrew a democratically elected President for an American backed dictator?

Or when the Brits sent gunboats to prevent the above democratically elected President from Nationalising his country's own oil?
540 2018-01-02 22:53:22 How are 40k jobs created? By whom? If it’s from the oil companies, how are they saving $ with the pipeline? On the surface this number seems inflated.
541 2018-01-02 22:53:20 Bentley lost their touch of class about 20 years ago. Now it's footballers, porn kings & oil money.
542 2018-01-02 22:53:18 And you behave like Twitter goons. Wait for things to settle dont put oil in fire
543 2018-01-02 22:53:15 we ain't buyin' none of your snake oil...now get!
544 2018-01-02 22:53:14 Lone oil inna the food. The chicken bun up yuh fuck . Who serves brown stew chicken like that anyway???
545 2018-01-02 22:53:11 I don’t use the balm because I don’t shape it really. If you have thicker beard hair it helps though.  Oil doesn’t make it greasy if you don’t put too much on
546 2018-01-02 22:53:10 Theil got his balls blown off by the leveraged long oil trade in 2011-14...basically wiped out his hedge fund. He’s got a history of concentrated bets. When he loses, it’s epic.
547 2018-01-02 22:52:55 Yh we've used that, it helped a little but honestly cocunt oil worked better for him. Think it depends on severity etc as well. Yh I didn't I thought it was a rush or allergy to something poor kiddos hey x
548 2018-01-02 22:52:45 No castor oil is the one u shd b using
549 2018-01-02 22:52:38 weren’t quick enough, and she ended them the same way she did their father. Steaming hot tears fell down her face, she grabbed an oil lamp that was lit, and threw it to the ground, she used the Force to intensify the fire creating an inferno. She ran out as she saw people ---
550 2018-01-02 22:52:29 and also it depends on what you mean "copying an art style is" cus anime in general is just copying an art style, oil painting is just copying an art style. 

copying someone specific's whole art habits and topics isn't simply "copying an art style"
551 2018-01-02 22:52:21 Ooh just saw this. Dream Beard oil is what I use. A little more expensive but I think it’s better
552 2018-01-02 22:52:18 My brothers and i daily struggle.... “can you get me the hook up on an oil change” “can you get me the hook up on an inspection sticker” “can you get me the hook up on a golf cart” I forgot the “hook up” pays my parents bills
553 2018-01-02 22:52:16 Yeah, that's one of the reasons I don't drive a diesel car any more.  Prices go up way too high in the winter.  I think it's the home heating oil demand.
554 2018-01-02 22:52:14 Black bean hash; onion, peppers, potatoes, stir fry in a shot of oil, then add canned bbs (after draining). Warm thru.
555 2018-01-02 22:52:09 The year is 2041, the world is coming out of a North Korea caused nuclear winter, countries are at war over dwindling oil supplies and the Bengals are handing over GM responsibilities to HC Marvin Lewis.
556 2018-01-02 22:52:09 If I want hair like @BrickyOrchid8 not only do I have to grow a bit longer hear but forehead as well, maybe some oil for it too...
557 2018-01-02 22:52:08 Fool I have a promising 76% of an oil company I’m 15 ofc i cat make money on my own retard and my Gucci hat prolly costs more than your full closet
558 2018-01-02 22:51:47 Yes, you slashed regulations which are designed to prevent the next Deep Water Horizon, Exxon Valdez, and the newest major oil leak in the Dakotas. Congratulations for setting up the next major ecological disaster and will you name it after yourself.

562 2018-01-02 22:51:02 @realDonaldTrump @PutinRF_Eng  As Russia gives oil to North Korea Trump says nothing. As the sanctions on Russia sign by congress 5 months ago , still not put in place. Putin has the goods on Trump. Hey traitor Don , the whole worlds watching. Tax breaks for rich? Feed America
563 2018-01-02 22:51:02 Pipe burst at quaboag ! Oil everywhere! @BrettKustigian
564 2018-01-02 22:51:00 ATTENTION TO ALL BUYING HOME HEATING OIL...   DO NOT ORDER FROM AWE OIL IN NEWARK DELAWARE!!!! THEY ARE THIEVES, SCAM ARTISTS & LIARS!!!!!  THEY WILL ROB YOU BLIND
565 2018-01-02 22:50:50 This guy apparently has never heard of preventative maintenance. "I don't have to change the oil in my car. The little oil and check engine lights aren't on!"
566 2018-01-02 22:50:45 What’s to defend? He’s correct. Bayern hold more might over the rest of the clubs than in any other of the top five countries. Only PSG have now surpassed with dirty oil money in turning Ligue 1 in to their feeder league.

568 2018-01-02 22:50:20 The same place they were when the invasion form the middle east took place in their countries....In the pockets of wealthy oil barons
569 2018-01-02 22:50:17  took the @jeep in for service this morning and they didn’t replace the drain plug so now all my oil is on my garage floor!!! And this was the dealership service center!!
570 2018-01-02 22:50:06 As a vet myself, I'm certain that Gen. Mattis understands this.  China ignores selling oil N. Korea, whaling etc.. And Obama borrowed more $ than we can repay.  Looks like they're looking for a way to ambush US. How easy to back up N.Korea??

573 2018-01-02 22:49:44 Well, you can never put too much olive oil on anything...
574 2018-01-02 22:49:40 Vapes are the original oil diffusers
575 2018-01-02 22:49:39 Like we didn't do for Syria, we could have had an ally but we failed them, hopefully we don't fail Iran, like we will if we make it about the oil.
576 2018-01-02 22:49:29 Just got a free oil change  2018 starting off great!
577 2018-01-02 22:49:24 Hatch has dementia. And now that he's got his big kickback from the oil & gas industry so they can drill, frack & destroy some of Utah's national monuments, he'll take the money & run. This man disgusts me.
578 2018-01-02 22:49:23 I used to like Hatch somewhat. Let’s see what happens with oil leases on what were national park lands and who gets paid for them. Orrin’s grandchildren set up for life??
579 2018-01-02 22:49:19 Essential Oil Rollerball making with kiddos tomorrow! @NewHanoverCoSch are out.  What are your plans? #wilmington #winterstorm #snow #ilm
580 2018-01-02 22:49:05 I am doing an AMA today on oil and gasoline price manipulation.
581 2018-01-02 22:49:00 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
582 2018-01-02 22:48:54 I honestly LOVE making a curry-crusted turkey burger and eating it with mango chutney, not sure how that would work on beef though. A pinch of ras-al-hanout or another peppery blend would probably do well (to cook off the spices I spray oil directly on the spices, works well).
583 2018-01-02 22:48:49 They have a right 2 because Bush sr went after them 4 their oil an then Bush jr went after them 4 revenge under false pretenses if America has nuclear weapons with a pres. Like Trumpwhy shouldn't they have theirs ask urself what makes america more entitled
584 2018-01-02 22:48:47 Been taking lansoprazole on n off since last op and it's pap. Omeprazole/lansop is OK 1st thing for a few hours but don't find much help later on. It's brutal. Feel for you. Sadly these days my body is incapable of processing most foods with any fat/oil. Which is obviously shit.
585 2018-01-02 22:48:39 No one is saying that....I think we can all agree that at some point the oil will dry up and given how long it takes to create a thriving industry (decades really) Fostering green while sensibly moving away from oil is the right way (the argument is how and when and how much)
586 2018-01-02 22:48:34 I see what you saying. Nah I was legit focusing on the “I shouldn’t have to com my hair” shorties here. Like yes tf you do. It’s known that everybody’s “polished” won’t be the same, but some oil, some water, something.
587 2018-01-02 22:48:33 Save the gun oil , a rusty tentpeg will prolong your 'justice' - just make sure you're wearing trump for president t-shirt - insanity plea.
588 2018-01-02 22:48:29 No one is by Dr Flower's snake oil today go ahead and run him out of town
589 2018-01-02 22:48:14 I just want someone else to wash my windows, check tires & oil, fill my washer fluid. I kind of remember those days. What? Gas was .25 cents a gallon. The good old days. 
590 2018-01-02 22:47:52 Are you sure it wasn't the Russians - or BIG OIL or the coke brothers or aliens?
591 2018-01-02 22:47:38 Hair care tip of the day: Never pour hot water on your hair as it gets rid of the natural oil that the hair has
592 2018-01-02 22:47:36 Looks like its time to oil my dry ass scalp again
593 2018-01-02 22:47:16 My room smells like oil paints
594 2018-01-02 22:47:15 That + vitamin C serum + almond oil 
595 2018-01-02 22:47:12 I’m on this one, oil. Please follow back
596 2018-01-02 22:47:07 Snake Oil salesman. Shame.
597 2018-01-02 22:46:47 nope, it's primarily down to oil price versus production costs (which for the oil sands are understandably higher than traditional mining operations). For this to be true, you would see the investment shifting elsewhere but it's not.
598 2018-01-02 22:46:47 Also Oklahoma: You get free oil changes for a year if you buy your next vehicle with Mayfield Ford.
599 2018-01-02 22:46:38 Oil pan rubbing on the frame and the gears not shifting #e39 #engineswap
600 2018-01-02 22:46:29 Remain in liquid assets but be ready to move - my guess is that Oil will surprise heavily to the upside in 2018 with geopolitical tensions increasing in the ME - investors will question renewables at some stage - buy Gold on the dips - careful on cryptos
601 2018-01-02 22:46:23 Recipe for 4 slices

Finely crumble 2cups of corn flakes (no sugar)

602 2018-01-02 22:46:12 Bruh. After today’s activities @Netta_World is stuck with me forever!!!! We gotta get some lotion or oil 
603 2018-01-02 22:46:09 Poor baby. I saw someone recommended pot. I would look into CBD oil for her. My friend's elderly dog is on it and it helps him a lot. He's a 16yo pug.
604 2018-01-02 22:46:07 Husband: well I’m going to grab the coconut oil and take my pants off!

Me: ummm.

Husband: my calves are sore from running...?

*10 seconds pass*

Husband: ohhh. That doesn’t sound very good.
605 2018-01-02 22:45:58 WHAT? An OIL exec touted the success of an oil pipeline??? Now THAT’S news!

Now, that’s the pipeline that just leaked, right?
606 2018-01-02 22:45:56 #oil opens the year around $60!
607 2018-01-02 22:45:48 I've been sleeping on olive oil for the longest time. It has done wonders for my skin and hair this terrible winter.
608 2018-01-02 22:45:37 I didn’t think I would appreciate candles, wax warmers, and essential oil diffusers till I was like 30, but here I am
609 2018-01-02 22:45:15 Witch hazel and aloe Vera oil 
610 2018-01-02 22:45:07 It's never about saving the people just worshipping their Gold Oil Drugs and other resources water minerals, m rare earth etc been chasing for over 100 years.
611 2018-01-02 22:45:05 I have an essential oil diffuser and lord it makes my life 10x better
612 2018-01-02 22:44:59 I rando bought an essential oil diffuser cuz it said that it would me sleep and relax? Fingers crossed.
also, how do I use it?
613 2018-01-02 22:44:59 Thought it was a good idea to put some olbas oil on my pillow... until it started burning my face and making my eye sting
614 2018-01-02 22:44:59 Soak hands in warm olive oil once a week for strong nails and youthful looking hands.
615 2018-01-02 22:44:42 @seanhannity they still have oil based paint!  Smh
616 2018-01-02 22:44:34 #A1M northbound entry sliproad at J4 (#Hatfield, A414) is closed due to an overturned vehicle and large oil spillage. Recovery and clean-up crew are en-route. roadpoliceBCH are on scene. Also 1 lane (of 3) closed on the main carriageway past scene. Please pass with care. …
617 2018-01-02 22:44:33 #PrezBoneSpurs Prez Bone Spurs, I bet you even do the oil changes on AF1!!
618 2018-01-02 22:44:24 I cleanse my face thoroughly in the sink, maybe slap on a bit of sweet almond oil, shower, then get out and tone (lemon witch hazel) and re-moisturize with the oil.
619 2018-01-02 22:44:16 Was he not talking about the leadership?  If you say “oil companies are crooks” you mean the person working on the rig?  Of course not.
620 2018-01-02 22:44:03 Why does everyone and their grandma use olive oil for cooking? I used it once to try it out and it was vile.
621 2018-01-02 22:44:00 sitting here getting my oil changed & started thinking about pizza 
622 2018-01-02 22:43:49 lol they told me an hour-1:30 to do my oil change and took 3 hours and didn’t call like they said. Also didn’t wash my car like they was supposed to.
623 2018-01-02 22:43:36 was about to say, those women would be arrested walking down the street in Saudi dressed like that.
Hope 2018 is the year their oil supply becomes seriously depleted
624 2018-01-02 22:43:36 You just gave Palestinian millions dollar you were guilty when u gave Jewish thepalstinian land not only you have giving all UN to support israiel  ..it's laughable you have taken billions of Muslim oil with low price and weapons to kill eachother
625 2018-01-02 22:43:10 Oil is holding the $60 per barrel mark as anti-government protests in Iran provide support.
626 2018-01-02 22:42:59 I love all my oils and bit the bullet to “sell” them finally. I just ordered the slim and sassy oil! I’ll let you know!!
627 2018-01-02 22:42:51 Yes. Medicated sodium sulfur cleanser in the morning in the shower. Two cleansers at the sink at night; an oil based cleanser to wash off makeup and a gel cleanser to clean my face. Then mask(as needed), toner, chemical exfoliant, retinol, face cream.
628 2018-01-02 22:42:40 Who needs coffee when I have my tea tree essential oil??
629 2018-01-02 22:42:22 Bout to go check my mother into the looney bin.. she just handed out my phone number to the guy who changed my oil because SHE  thought he was cute 
630 2018-01-02 22:42:19 Ain’t nobody saying your edges have to be slick as oil. But try. Please try.
631 2018-01-02 22:42:11 does the oil NOT sting though this is wild
632 2018-01-02 22:42:08 why is that important..you got tech stocks?

While you were busy tweeting this, Russia was caught selling oil and technology to NK.  Why has Trump only singled out China? ummmm. 
633 2018-01-02 22:42:07 They want a puppet regime friendly to the West, who will promptly "sell" oil assets to foreign interests upon recommendation by "expert" "consultants" coincidentally also supplied by the West.
634 2018-01-02 22:41:54 College is asking the car dealership to heat up your chili in between classes while your getting an oil change 
635 2018-01-02 22:41:40 At Mutare board there is a college run by a lady who doesn't pay her employees n a couple of smes. At Karina there should be a cooking oil plant.
636 2018-01-02 22:41:32 You forgot to include no playoff wins. This organization continues to swindle the fans by selling snake oil
637 2018-01-02 22:41:09 @nahla_oil شكراً
638 2018-01-02 22:40:58 What’s worse “crazier or stupid”?  He will build a wall and the Dems can only sit back and watch.  Y’all just can not accept the fact that he beat Hillary and is a much better #POTUS than Hillarywoukf have y’all bet been.  Thank God! #DrainTheSwamp
639 2018-01-02 22:40:41 Thanks girl, I was worrying about the lack of energy I would have but apparently healthy fats like avacado, coconut oil and peanut butter helps
640 2018-01-02 22:40:39 What’s a good oil free foundation? 
641 2018-01-02 22:40:29 What brands of beard oil works best for you? (personally and/or the ladies) My B is coming along nice, just wanted your opinion.

644 2018-01-02 22:40:06 I would love to! Unfortunately, I live in a really old house with this antiquated oil burner, and I can't afford to change over to something more efficient--yet. I'd love to save the money. Oil is SUPER expensive, too. But I'm looking forward to making the change.
645 2018-01-02 22:40:01 YEAH definitely bc if you ever sell it, most ppl will ask to see a maintenence history. look around the house for oil change receipts, the stuff you got when you bought the car, & then log everything by the date and the mileage <3
646 2018-01-02 22:39:56 Marvin and Mike continue to sell the snake oil
647 2018-01-02 22:39:53 i use an oil and gel cleanser at night and only gel cleanser in the motivation
648 2018-01-02 22:39:26 There's so much material with Trump, yet I've only heard 2 or 3 new or original jokes about him since the inauguration. He has managed to kill comedy.
649 2018-01-02 22:39:00 @USMC @POTUS @VP poor nations robbing OUR call center jobs broke as fuck and their Presidents ain’t even educated nor speak English (Central America & the Philippines) they think they deserve our jobs those foreign shemales wolves useless fucks who can’t even do oil changes.
650 2018-01-02 22:38:30 I couldn't find the recipe but it's basically smashed sweet potatoes baked in the oven with garlic and oil?? or garlic butter

653 2018-01-02 22:37:57 the "low THC" oil she was using according to the article was 1ml/mg, the test you posted lists high THC "hemp" oil as 0.0184ml/mg, her oil is more than 50 times potency of the strongest oil used in your data, and in your data the 0.0184ml/mg samples did return positives for THC
654 2018-01-02 22:37:54 @johnoconnor64 

Out of order. More oil changes than Lewis Hamilton....and skid marks for that matter

656 2018-01-02 22:37:31 my oil change was FREE wow i love today
657 2018-01-02 22:37:16 That protests emerge simultaneously is not suspect? You don't even make sense. Presumably the US just spend billions funding bullshit 'human rights/democracy/opposition' groups abroad out of concern for their fellow man & have no history of meddling in oil rich nations.
658 2018-01-02 22:36:47 Actually not as big of a funder as Saudia Arabia 
Who we support 
Because they give us oil money
659 2018-01-02 22:36:32 Excuse me, my beautiful chocolate melanated kemetic empress from the  heavens, I don’t see the problem here. . Take a bath in rose water and coconut oil, light some incense and rethink that philosophy for me.
660 2018-01-02 22:36:18 So I woke up this morning wondering like where tf my man at and called him and he said oh baby your check engine light was on and you were out of oil so I changed your oil and I’m getting your engine checked now 
661 2018-01-02 22:35:48 Thought I pulled to the place where you can sit in your warm car and get your oil changed  nope guy came right up and said please exit your vehicle and walk inside. It’s freezing in here breh

670 2018-01-02 22:34:43 I don't care about facebook's engagement numbers. Nor Apple's. Why should I? Of what compelling interest is it to me that others are more engaged?

It's also true that more people are suckered in by fake news, scams, frauds and phonies now.

671 2018-01-02 22:34:41 This is where you slide oil!!!!
672 2018-01-02 22:34:30 The best part about being a girl, is you totally get taken advantage of when getting your oil changed.

680 2018-01-02 22:32:05 i agree gassin. I am holding $RSG and $KRC for some gold exposure.   If gold, oil, bitcoin and most commodities are booming does this suggest that there will be a massive inflationary pressure? (not familiar with my economics though) .
681 2018-01-02 22:32:03 Well, basically I've used polychromos (greek for "many colours") oil based pencils. Since they are oil based they are easier to dilute with a solvent/ paint thinner, meaning that you blend the colours on the paper and "paint" with the pigment

709 2018-01-02 22:29:34 Your masters in Moscow and Peking are supplying NK with oil, Numbnuts.   The world is laughing at you.   Just like actual Americans at home.  

Impotent, ignorant and delusional is no way to go through life, Sunshine.

714 2018-01-02 22:29:15 @irvingoil I’ve been on hold for 2h and 15 min....I have no oil...I have automatic fill. I’m starting to feel very frustrated. It’s cold.
715 2018-01-02 22:29:07 do you keep a log of maintenance/stuff did to the car? (oil changes/brake replacements/etc?) and since it's now 2018, a lot of batteries start to crap out at 5ish years so tbh it's probably the battery
716 2018-01-02 22:29:03 Does Wal-Mart sell Peppermint Essential oil? I’m not trying to order it I need it ashap
717 2018-01-02 22:28:59 hm kind of a shit day to come home from out of town and learn the oil line to the furnace is busted and there’s no heat and not a chance of having it until at least noon tomorrow. anyone want to take in ? #fixerupper
718 2018-01-02 22:28:52 Resend fracking regulations, soften offshore oil regulations (remember deepwater horizon?) ease Medicare guidelines re nursing home care...

722 2018-01-02 22:28:44 Prepping for our journey tomorrow with the most exciting thing: an oil change!
723 2018-01-02 22:28:42 Gas & oil prices doubling?  I imagine it's pretty chilly there.

729 2018-01-02 22:26:51 I suspect that soon ISIS will roll into Iran from Afghanistan, NATO will roll into Iran to stop ISIS, ISIS  gets driven out, Iran ends up a mess and the West will get its hands on their oil. Israel and Saudi then have a big party.
730 2018-01-02 22:26:36 i put a little too much oil in the pan to fry my gyoza but that's my own burden to bear
731 2018-01-02 22:26:30 I have a clean ass room that smells like eucalyptus oil fwm
732 2018-01-02 22:26:29 Yeah alcohol would be least helpful at that point, best thing I can think of would be CBD oil, can’t OD and helps with sleep

735 2018-01-02 22:26:12 The irony and stupidity of the #iranianprotests is it’s mostly economic caused by #sanctions imposed on them by @realDonaldTrump he preaches #peace but wants #war because the #zionist state of #israel and the oil tycoons of #SaudiArabia want it #truth
736 2018-01-02 22:26:06 If you've had a rough night out, ask your boyfriend to oil you up before sex. He will give you a FULL body massage, bet.
737 2018-01-02 22:26:02 He hasn’t actually cut off their aid, just said he would. If he actually does it that will be interesting. I’ve never understood why Pakistan got so much money from the US. Saudi Arabia has all that oil, but Pakistan has nothing but religious nutcases and corruption.
738 2018-01-02 22:25:57 Do I have to?! It’s like taking a dose of cod liver oil.

740 2018-01-02 22:25:41 I hated them too! But was the only way I could manage commuting  peppermint oil was brilliant, had a steady supply on me for any nausea waves (also smelly loos at work )
741 2018-01-02 22:25:37 My god ...THANK YOU FOR SAVING US don't know what we would have done if we had been independent and discovered all of the oil, we would probably begged westminster to show us what do do with it all after all they did use it wisely didn't they....thank you..so humble

753 2018-01-02 22:23:52 Very bummed I could not EASILY convince one of the boys to get an oil change with me
754 2018-01-02 22:23:16 Oh then use castor oil on your beard roots morning and night. And eat more beans.
755 2018-01-02 22:23:07 It tends to be harder to start a car in the cold. If you haven't changed your oil in awhile that could be an issue and if you haven't get an oil that withstands cold weather.
756 2018-01-02 22:23:06 Also Gartman oil at $54 : oil will go down from here.
Oil up 10 % since then
757 2018-01-02 22:22:48 My oil is THICK today
758 2018-01-02 22:22:36 It was Living Proof, no frizz nourishing oil... not sure what the actual oil is though:(
759 2018-01-02 22:22:34 Oil, mate. You should know that by now. Replace the Shah with his son, kick him out, arm and then murder his enemy...
760 2018-01-02 22:22:30 i got new tires and changed my oil Friday and got the routine maintenance lights to go off , here we are Tuesday & another light turns on like fuck me & my muuuuulaaaa right 
761 2018-01-02 22:22:28 It will come!! Evenings were the worst for me too. Used to eat a big meal at lunch. Got better around 17-18 weeks if I recall...until then, peppermint oil and pressure point wristbands are your friends 
762 2018-01-02 22:22:19 Baby boomers are getting worked up on how millennials are obsessed with avocado toast and essential oil diffusers, as if they weren’t equally obsessed with that singing fish they hung up in the kitchen 
763 2018-01-02 22:22:18 Here is a story for you. They are a lot of landlord's are not running the boiler at night when you need the heat. The boiler works perfectly. However they do not give heat at night. The boiler is being controlled by their cell phones. They are conserving oil.
764 2018-01-02 22:21:59 And Romney wants to throw utah to the climate deniers and oil barons
765 2018-01-02 22:21:52 No one can trust KRG"officials", they don't keep thier promises. They broke many deals with Baghdad before regarding oil and budget, It's useless to negotiat with them.
In reality, Masoud Barazani still controls the border crossings and oil smuggling, his mafia gets the revenue.
766 2018-01-02 22:21:49 Oh. Right. You're one of the crackpots that think Trudeau likes terrorists and caused the low oil prices. Sorry to bother you. You can put your tin foil hat back on now.

772 2018-01-02 22:21:07 Thank you @GalpinLincoln & @LincolnClient for making that the easiest 10K maintenance service ever! Valet picked my car up, left me a loaner, & brought mine back home squeaky clean, oil changed and tires rotated all in under 4 hours! #Awesome 
773 2018-01-02 22:20:56 All I wanted this year was for someone to take my car for an oil change
774 2018-01-02 22:20:54 I found the whole Hong Kong ship delivering oil to North Korea to be beyond suspect.

Thought it was a false flag from the start. 

China is the one trying to keep the ships from being blocked.

Tensions are mounting and China is prodding Trump.

778 2018-01-02 22:19:59 Shares of oil-and-gas companies rallied as investors opened the New Year with a show of increased risk tolerance. The energy sector has roared back to favor recently as oil prices rebound and economic-growth expectations rise. The price of oil ticked down.

785 2018-01-02 22:18:43 Line 5 moves 500, 000 barrels of hard crude oil thru the Mackinac straits per day and Cathy Stepp is not qualified to handle any of this.
786 2018-01-02 22:18:41 But the most damaging is still #oil
787 2018-01-02 22:18:41 Once you sew the seed,  they will either start to look and read or they won't.  Some too entrenched, never question why their lifestyle in a country with oil is so bad. Some are just dumb, some have no interest in politics.....its abugger
788 2018-01-02 22:18:27 Like putting oil & water together. Labour would like the UK to be more like Iran than the US. A vote for today’s Labour is a vote for Iran style Policy outcomes. Very sad.
789 2018-01-02 22:18:23 We need to get rid of Libs. Worse than Tories. Ball taxed & spent us into oblivion on Muskrat in oil bust +doub rates &carbon.

790 2018-01-02 22:18:11 For the fries, put some oil in a pan and re-fry them. The chicken though, hopefully science can answer that in 2018...
791 2018-01-02 22:18:07 I would push oil in around the edges, let it sit, pry up the edges and apply more oil, etc., until the whole thing works free.
792 2018-01-02 22:18:06 A Democrat will create social programs to ease the #MAGA crowd's suffering, then another snake oil salesmen will arrive touting trickle down economics and they'll fall for it again. #Dotards

796 2018-01-02 22:17:49 I was once a ball-boy at a European water-polo championships where the Polish goalies routine included standing by the side of the pool and covering himself from head to foot in what was either Vaseline or massage oil for a good ~5 minutes before the game began.

Disconcerting.
797 2018-01-02 22:17:48 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, can you please explain why opening the Arctic National Wildlife Sanctuary to oil exploration is related to taxes and helping the middle to low class taxpayers with the tax bill? #Oil #TaxBill #Conservation #nature
798 2018-01-02 22:17:46 My own dyslexia was outweighed by an ability to juggle words, even if I could neither write nor pell them. But a generation later, seeing the same problems still not helped, and snake oil prevailing,  it was impossible to stay silent.

800 2018-01-02 22:17:36 If they checked your oil and tires and basically was a car hop for snacks in the car, then I would consider a Gas Jockey nice to have (yeah they used to be called gas jockeys and I want that to come back now)
801 2018-01-02 22:17:34 Gift of gab saving me at this oil change.
802 2018-01-02 22:17:33 Stop raping our land for oil companies, etc...
803 2018-01-02 22:17:30 Conversely, it does not make sense nor lengthen the engine life to start up on a frigid morning, and shoot off prior to letting the oil and other fluids permeate the engine for a few minutes!
804 2018-01-02 22:17:27 Yep. Was laughing my ass off up until that point.

807 2018-01-02 22:16:58 Exploiting cancer victims via wild claims or cures outside of The Western Skeptical System is utterly evil. I can't think of anything worse than snake oil merchants getting fat on cancer patients.
808 2018-01-02 22:16:46 My sister showed me that trick years ago for a quick and tasty dinner. *Slice up some onions, garlic, chicken, cherry or banana peppers, then just add some olive oil & the pepper liquid. Serve it over pasta, rice, quinoa, etc.

810 2018-01-02 22:16:41 Oil can loosen glue, although it may take some time with something like that. It coats the glue and then it's not sticky. Friendly on the wood, too.  Furniture oil, olive oil, whatever you've got handy.

822 2018-01-02 22:14:37 I think that he Is saying Europe for the europeans, Is the same speech of Trump. I think the word Is more complex. For example for many centuries Europe took what ever they could.from Africa (Gold, diamonds, oil), and now they complain about migrants. Sorry my bad english
823 2018-01-02 22:14:37 Have you tried Aleve? It’s the best!! It works so well. Also if you don’t want to use pills, peppermint essential oil works wonders too. Dab it on your wrist and forehead and inhale it.

827 2018-01-02 22:14:20 I use olive oil instead of coconut oil for the body scrub its easier to wash off
828 2018-01-02 22:14:14 The underbelly of winter is how much oil I'm slathering on my skin.

831 2018-01-02 22:13:47 Happy new year. I liked the video. I would add "national security" reasons to your list of "what this is really about" along with oil and territory control and influence. There IS an actual security threat concern in this case.

833 2018-01-02 22:13:45 My father had a saying I never could figure out: Its colder than an oil dweller's rear end.
834 2018-01-02 22:13:42 Yeah they did this to my daughter, I wanted to cry! Just flinging her around like pizza dough. All greased up in palm oil screaming at the top of her lungs.
835 2018-01-02 22:13:42 The ratios are more complex and varied than commonly believed, though. A sirloin steak can easily contain more UFA than SFA. Olive Oil is ~14% SFA. Lard is more MUFA than SFA.
836 2018-01-02 22:13:41 Meanwhile oil is doubled per barrel, 144 thousand mfg jobs went overseas, the dollar has fell to recession type lows, unemployment is rising in the rustbelt. Might want to add some real facts in there.
837 2018-01-02 22:13:30 Not a problem Mich!  We can dump them as fast as we follow them!
838 2018-01-02 22:13:10 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for apple cider vineagar, and put some lemon essential oil in my diffuser.

844 2018-01-02 22:12:11 People like Owen claim the US invaded Iraq to steal their oil. The USA didn't import any Iraqi oil after the Iraq war!
845 2018-01-02 22:11:54 Would love to know why Trump has said nothing about Russia smuggling oil products to North Korea.

847 2018-01-02 22:11:40 As someone who likes to cook, I want to take a moment to say that the metric system is godawful for use in the kitchen. Everyone who uses cups can picture what a cup looks like. Can you form a mental picture of 235 ml of olive oil?
848 2018-01-02 22:11:39 If they can finish this oil change soon, I’ll have time to take a nap. Please oh please, nap gods!
849 2018-01-02 22:11:39 You don't live in the real world. On one hand you want fracking stopped which makes us energy independent with natural gas and oil, and not beholden to these oil producing states, and on the other don't recognize that many industrial countries depend on fossil fuels.
850 2018-01-02 22:11:38 I got black excited when I saw the giant tub of coconut oil they were selling at Costco.
851 2018-01-02 22:11:27 @DK_SocialMedia  as the rain cometh out of the carcases, the rod of the oil on his voice. 5:29 His offering shall the LORD of hosts shall he take away from an hill.

853 2018-01-02 22:11:14 Wearing the face of them, I race home and notice an oil rig cry softly
854 2018-01-02 22:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: moist crust with spicy motor oil and pulled pork.
855 2018-01-02 22:11:03 so i’m getting an oil change right and the guy is like “man we need to get u some swag” and i asked “well whys that?” then he replied “the seat is so close to the steering wheel. we need to get u some swag and lean that seat back“ 
LIKE SORRY I CANT REACH THE PEDALS
856 2018-01-02 22:11:00 I said the exact samething. I could feel the angels about to come down with the baby oil.
857 2018-01-02 22:10:59 I feel your pain! I have the oil heater going, the electric heater going, & my electric oven on right now because it's so freaking cold.
858 2018-01-02 22:10:47 I got two oil diffusers and 3 bottles of lavender for Christmas. I knew my life was stressful but damn
859 2018-01-02 22:10:39 peppermint oil has literally just changed my life, always in so much pain and bloating when i eat and that shit is a fucking miracle worker
860 2018-01-02 22:10:28 #Rouhani says about '$50 BILLION' is unaccounted for in government's planning for annual budget "because of issues beyond our control". That's more than #Iran's #oil revenue in 2017.

#OOTT
861 2018-01-02 22:10:21 4) President Buhari despite all his campaign promises of diversification  has spent billions just looking for oil in the Lake chad region, a  region known for its agricultural prowess. Why? @omonlakiki @OlaFabiyi2 @OfficialPDPNig @AtikuOrg

863 2018-01-02 22:10:04 Americans made this choice for the world. We elected people who are owned by Big Oil, and Big Oil wants that tundra.
864 2018-01-02 22:10:03 As disgusting as it is fish oil pills, vitamin C and green tea alllll day
865 2018-01-02 22:09:54 Is rose oil the new coconut oil?
866 2018-01-02 22:09:52 @JesseBWatters I live in eastern Ohio, construction workers back to work. Oil& gas booming, some coal jobs back. Prospect business looking to build ing the area. Richard is wrong.
867 2018-01-02 22:09:36 I think electric cars and HSR (of some form) are pretty inevitable, given finite oil supplies (or at least those profitable to extract at current prices); full self-driving may be another problem perpetually five years away from today.
868 2018-01-02 22:09:29 @PlayDomiNations finally discounts on airfield! Wooo! Was taking forever to save 70,000 oil. But had 42,000 right away!
869 2018-01-02 22:09:03 Lil hack for you guys! If you want white teeth quickly or your teeth to be a lil bit whiter than, just have a designated tooth brush that you put coconut oil and baking soda on and then brush your teeth with that then brush your teeth with toothpaste!
870 2018-01-02 22:08:58 Buy into Big Oil
871 2018-01-02 22:08:54 you could believe whatever you want. But just take a look GDP/capita of america and isreal. then compare it with iran's. and keep in mind that Iran has the 2nd largest natural gas and 4th largest oil reserves in the world.
872 2018-01-02 22:08:44 I hope they keep the tickets in that price range. I can afford those. I wouldn't be going with the prices they're asking in Buffalo. I think cost is playing a big part in this. The Oil Kings are out drawing team Canada and team US...and the Oil Kings have only won 10 games

876 2018-01-02 22:08:08 Thanks Susan for letting Trump destroy our oceans even MORE!!! The Deepwater Horizon oil spill wasn't a big deal, so thank god Trump axed any rule or regulation passed after the HISTORIC CATASTROPHE!!!! A very Christmasy thing to do over the holidays. #OilSpillsAreGreat #MAGA
877 2018-01-02 22:08:06 As always,  my pleasure.  Hot Head is an awesome company.  : )
878 2018-01-02 22:08:04 If they told Hillary to go work on an oil rig would it be better
879 2018-01-02 22:08:03 Ginger chews and ginger essential oil. Also an antioxidant drink I already drank daily helped a ton!! @_princessskush was sick for a while with both of hers. I’m sure she has more tricks than I do
880 2018-01-02 22:07:26 U got any coconut oil? Worked wonders for mine 
881 2018-01-02 22:07:19 my blood pressure is clearly maximum because I have eaten carbs today, not coconut oil. Im probably lucky to be alive tbh.
882 2018-01-02 22:07:14 Big shout out to @yellowbellyLou & @John_Pakey for recommending a drop of oil in the bathtub to clear a blocked nose  Only had peppermint oil but it worked a treat!
883 2018-01-02 22:07:03 If I was an owner and I just signed roughly $170 mill in guaranteed money to two players just to finish in the bottom 6, again, I might be a little fire happy.
884 2018-01-02 22:06:33 .@HealthRanger hi mike, thanks for all your great info. What is the best cbd oil you have tested?. And if a person wanted the effects of liquid thc. What ones would you recommend?. Thanks, lace

886 2018-01-02 22:06:26 @realDonaldTrump didn't do nearly as well with train wrecks and oil pipeline spills in 2017. Perhaps he can do better this year, or better yet #ResignNow
887 2018-01-02 22:06:24 Finally got my oil changed

890 2018-01-02 22:05:34 ALWAYS!!
891 2018-01-02 22:05:28 Be honest, when @apollorobot had you almost on your side, you panicked so much a little bit of oil leaked out ;)
892 2018-01-02 22:05:22 No. Let us know what we can do to help.
893 2018-01-02 22:05:09 Jojoba oil. Works like a charm
894 2018-01-02 22:05:08 Let me gon get my oil cleanser. I like to keep a bottle on deck
895 2018-01-02 22:05:00 Still they’ll only drive 25 and not 105 like a drunk driver would.
896 2018-01-02 22:04:54 Stupid arab! This is not iran so shut up and think about your country... Iranian people know you well. You have nothing... Just oil and after that you should ride your camels again... Heh
897 2018-01-02 22:04:52 Peligrosa por fundamentales. Plan transf 360 quiere reducir costes, deuda, +eficiencia,etc. Es muy ambicioso pq en 1buen momento de nuevo para tubos oil, no arranca del todo por vicios d fondo. Nueva dirección. Es como sniace, si sale bien pelotazo. Si no, rezar. Sector acompaña
898 2018-01-02 22:04:44 Been putting off this oil change. It needs to be done!
899 2018-01-02 22:04:39 Peppermint oil be making my dreads and my soul happy asab, love that shit, walking round head smelling like candy canes n shit 
900 2018-01-02 22:04:38 never forget the #CIA n America's name destroyed Iran's Democracy n 1953 b/c Iran was going to nationalize their own #OIL
901 2018-01-02 22:04:29 Oh yeah put oil in your eye, that's smart 
902 2018-01-02 22:04:23 2 months and 500+ miles over but i’m finally getting an oil change thank god 
903 2018-01-02 22:04:20 Was this invented? Dreamed by him while wrapped in oil and felt and darkness?
904 2018-01-02 22:04:05 I don’t think faces need oil
905 2018-01-02 22:03:46 And Mitt didn’t even beat out an oil executive for Sec of State! So lame. 
906 2018-01-02 22:03:41 I just conditioned my hair real good, put some castor oil in it and I can say with confidence, bitch my hair is luxurious. 
907 2018-01-02 22:03:40 It's the oil and fluids that'd freeze and seize your engine. Which is baaad! According to my dad who was a shade tree mechanic.

917 2018-01-02 22:02:36 Hopefully ppl don't confuse real Arabs with obese oil farting sheikhs
918 2018-01-02 22:02:21 Half the people here sound like Mourinho lately. Oil money, paid the ref, we did not have the ball, the ball was yellow, the grass was wet. Can you not just for once in your life appreciate the quality of football instead of complaining.
919 2018-01-02 22:02:21 I'm sure you could apply oil coats to floors.
920 2018-01-02 22:02:11 You don't need 30k for futures. Once we get the purple wedge fall, use futures because the reversal up is an opportunity to make a ton of money. 1 contract for oil is like 2770 dollars. If you have 13-15 k, you can average for about 4 contracts, which earns 4k for each dollar.
921 2018-01-02 22:01:56 One would hope but you get the feeling this season is going to be viewed as a one-off and everything that could go wrong did. Let us hope that isn't the case.
922 2018-01-02 22:01:56 Right ! Like damn acting she asking for an oil change lol
923 2018-01-02 22:01:48 Ugh me too. Feel better! I just drank a glass of water with oregano oil in it as I was told to and that didn't make 2018 any better either
924 2018-01-02 22:01:43 Just like a star across my sky. Just like an angel off the page. You have appeared in my life. Feel like I’ll never be the same. Just like a song in my heart. Just like oil on my hands. 
925 2018-01-02 22:01:40 I confused the chili oil for sweet sauce and I’m currently dying at the Pho restaurant
926 2018-01-02 22:01:37 Got called into work to clean a bunch of fucking oil on the floor but finished with 9 hours of ot for the week 
927 2018-01-02 22:01:27 Big potential here with oil rebounding and company securing some nice contracts again in the Middle East. Tiny marketcap, accelerating revenues and perhaps a return to profitability in the near future.
928 2018-01-02 22:01:22 Can't we just fix the issues with coconut oil? Seems to fix er'thang.
929 2018-01-02 22:01:19 @MBuhari never accepts responsibility for anything. Like dead people on the list  like fuel scarcity in December he blames Marketer whereas he is Minister of Petroleum. Nigeria’s Presidency is all about the oil dollars and sharing hence he is opposed to Fiscal Federalism.
930 2018-01-02 22:01:16 What rubbish is this?! This man should relocate the SS and SW to the north and bring the Whole North to the south! Oil explorations, NEDC, port in Kaduna, oil as his major focus? Sometimes I pity Buhari. His fixation with the south is painful to watch!
931 2018-01-02 22:01:11 Don’t talk to me if you ain’t about that essential oil life
932 2018-01-02 22:01:05 Baby In this weather i stay with a scarf on this head  and i take vitamin D3 pills daily for my skin and hair but i just moisturize it a lot and use coconut oil on occasion
933 2018-01-02 22:00:50 When you have to put desiel in the tank at home to hold the house heat over because your oil company is behind by 3 days and there's a storm coming and little oil left to begin with.
Fun times this week!
934 2018-01-02 22:00:43 Climate alarmists are incapable of arguing against the data I present, so they resort to things like:
"You aren't a scientist"
"You work for big oil"
"NASA went to the moon"
"Computer models are good"
935 2018-01-02 22:00:42 Thanks, Abby, so nice to you! It was great meeting u at IOW fest ... Abir struggles with many things. Such as knowing how to change the oil on a car. Totally useless as a driving companion.
936 2018-01-02 22:00:41 A well fought 3pts massive well done lads       now get out the massage oil, be ready for other hard fight Thursday.

941 2018-01-02 22:00:09 January 02, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
942 2018-01-02 22:00:06 oh, yeah. and i just had an oil change last week too.

should be good!!

thank you!!
943 2018-01-02 21:59:53 They used the “egregious error” thing to change the oil in my car AND cleaned out my gutters.
944 2018-01-02 21:59:52 In other words, The Bureau of Land Management oil, gas, and coal lease auctions will be open. Before the land was available for people to hunt, fish, camp and enjoy. He lied and said it was taken by the government and he is giving it back to the people and State.
945 2018-01-02 21:59:25 They did wonders for the Libyan slave trade.
946 2018-01-02 21:59:18 Every time you get a oil change they wanna tell you some extra shit smh..nigga maybe I like when my brakes squeak, it gives the car character
947 2018-01-02 21:59:17 Snake oil salesman to be exact. Other than that your analogy is perfect.
948 2018-01-02 21:59:11 Too much Musk Oil and not enough zero CO2 electricity, at a high subsidised price. Elon Musk never once gave it away, everybody had to pay and pay....... words of wisdom - from Lou Reed.
949 2018-01-02 21:59:07 Make sure to let your car idle for a few minutes before driving! Gotta get the oil warmed up!
950 2018-01-02 21:59:02 Snake oil... MSM has in abundance 
951 2018-01-02 21:59:02 1. If we only did business with countries who's government we approve of our economy would be in a right mess. No Russian oil?!
2. That's a flat-out lie.
952 2018-01-02 21:59:00 Didn’t quite work out for the snake oil salesman.
953 2018-01-02 21:58:54 I'm going to roll up the the mechanics tomorrow morning in full beat for my oil change
954 2018-01-02 21:58:49 I used to make a fabulous spinach and mushroom sauce. Sautéed mushrooms & garlic in olive oil and butter, drain, add spinach on top until wilted, add cream, reduce then use immersion blender. Serve with pork chops. 
955 2018-01-02 21:58:43 oil white is a dickhead #ythonestyhour
956 2018-01-02 21:58:42 This is fucking disgusting. Also, she loses points for not mixing with her mouth, not spitting the oil on the bird and mushing it around with her lips, and not spitting the stuffing directly into the bird.
957 2018-01-02 21:58:35 Talking about buying slim & sassy oil and Susan pipes in “I don’t think you need any help being sassy.” 
958 2018-01-02 21:58:32 oooh toning spray might be a good idea, though I've bought a 500ml one from the body shop recently, I'll wait for that to run out haha. I think I might need to try a muslin cloth, tried oil cleansers and they made me so spotty!

967 2018-01-02 21:57:26 Oil prices is what I mean has nothing to do with FG. It is what determines whether there is subsidy or not.
968 2018-01-02 21:57:23 2) This is a president that has engaged in the worse form of nepotism in Nigeria. He even openly admitted it. 97%.  There is no problem with the process, oil is losing its value. Most countries are on the verge of putting electric cars on there roads. @omonlakiki @OlaFabiyi2

971 2018-01-02 21:57:06 the US gov staged a coup to overthrow the only democratically elected leader in Iran’s history bc he nationalized oil. US sanctions have left Iranian citizens with “little food” for a nuclear program most don’t even support. nice job at manipulating the hicks that voted for you

THEN BISH WHY DIDNT YOU. LEAVE THE POOR GIRL ALONE.

978 2018-01-02 21:55:47 To be the least bit credible on the subject of the protests wouldn't the USA have to apologize for our participation in the overthrow of the DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF IRAN in 1953 to help out the Brits and an OIL COMPANY? We lack much credibility there.

984 2018-01-02 21:55:14 y’all make fun of me for using essential oils because “they’re weird,” but i kid u not, i woke up this morning and puked for 5 hours straight & could not move. i took some oil of oregano, and didn’t throw up again after that. 4 hours later, i just have a stomach ache & im hungry
985 2018-01-02 21:55:10 I forgot to announce my Best Vocals Of 2017: Michelle Nocon from Bathsheba. She can sound like she just gargled castor oil then go straight into sounding like she gargled hydrochloric acid.
986 2018-01-02 21:55:05 Snake oil or harmful poison. And lose crucial time in  getting effective treatment 

Regulated Pharma market:
Product efficacy and likely side effects (admittedly at a population level) are identified and made available to the end user. Personalised medicine narrows pop groups
987 2018-01-02 21:55:04 2018 predictions :

988 2018-01-02 21:54:48 Yea coconut oil can’t go on my face nor hair. I honestly can’t believe it works for people
989 2018-01-02 21:54:44 Yung oil leak lmaooooo I love car troubles
990 2018-01-02 21:54:43 ANNOUNCEMENT: A lot of people have been really into essential oils & diffusers lately but just be aware that the FDA only requires 5% of the bottle to be pure oil. Young Living is the ONLY brand that is 100%  pure with a seed to seal guarantee for ALL of their oils & products!!
991 2018-01-02 21:54:41 Y’all can kindly leave coconut oil and Shea butter twitter out of this fake Black Panther boycott mess.
992 2018-01-02 21:54:36 unfortunately I didn't realize Clinton's were snake oil salesmen 'til I read Bill's book, got to part that he allowed nix of Glass-Steagall, slammed book shut totally disgusted~
993 2018-01-02 21:54:27 I heard Jamaican black castor oil works but I think it depends on why and/or they broke off. I’ll ask Alecia.
994 2018-01-02 21:54:11 Use dove soap 
995 2018-01-02 21:54:07 Lil oil paint
996 2018-01-02 21:54:06 Someone please explain to Jodie Foster that today’s “superhero movies” may stink but not as bad as the Politically Motivated Crap.  PS:  Fracking is good, putting the “HATED” Russians out of the oil business. @FoxNews @maddow
997 2018-01-02 21:53:53 Yeah so sorry your monetizing the video and including all your usual links to your shop and tags to get the most exposure. Yes your very sorry your the BP oil guy from South Park that’s how sorry you are.
998 2018-01-02 21:53:51 Honestly I'd rather olive oil over coconut oil
999 2018-01-02 21:53:51 Men.. I bin wan dai
1000 2018-01-02 21:53:40 Ali just ordered a #Fiix mechanic to come to their house for a Oil And Filter Change on their Audi!  #North York #Toronto #Tech
1001 2018-01-02 21:53:35 @DeadlineWH DoesTrump mean Iran's money that we kept that the court ordered returned. There is a moron in the White House. The fact also is CIA helped mobs overthrow an elected Iranian government to put pro-US oil Shaw of Iran in power. We are the problem.

1005 2018-01-02 21:53:20 The best beard oils contain Jojoba, Argan or both. Marula Oil is another great carrier oil. @beardbrand, @zeusbeardco and @HonestAmish_com make great beard oils. Also 100% natural products are the only ones worth using #Beard #Bearded #Beards #BeardLife #BeardOil #BeardBalm
1006 2018-01-02 21:53:03 Easy to see that you and your dream team don't have too much enthusiasm anymore about the Russian connection.  Trying to change the angle, but won't work.  That guy is an oil and gas expert, but you don't report that.  Does not fit your dream.
1007 2018-01-02 21:52:57 The squeaky wheel gets the oil.

Crude oil dependant economies not finding it funny.
1009 2018-01-02 21:52:40 Just made an oil infused juul pod and let me tell ya it’s fire
1010 2018-01-02 21:52:37 Sis coconut oil is your best friend
1011 2018-01-02 21:52:31 Lavender essential oil for burns is astonishingly good. Keep some around in the kitchen for sure!
1012 2018-01-02 21:52:28 Hi Kevin! At my feeder station, I have: black oil sunflower seed (#1 offering), peanut hearts, peanuts in shell, cracked corn & a seed blend containing safflower, peanut hearts, shelled sunflower seed, dried fruit, etc. Also have suet/peanut butter in the log & suet cake.
1013 2018-01-02 21:52:26 Keep your hands out of the pension fund. Your horse manure about not investing in oil and coal is the stupidest thing I ever heard.
1014 2018-01-02 21:52:16 naw I didn't but they decided to fuck me up and put a lot of hot oil lol. it was sludgy tasted like 13-15
1015 2018-01-02 21:51:58 I'm no oil painting by the way, but she grinds on me. I can't put my finger on what because all my shallow as fuck mates think she's hot and all that jazz, but I'm like 'nahhh, I hate her face' and continue to sip my beer!
1016 2018-01-02 21:51:47 #abpoli #ableg Honestly, what more does @OilGasCanada want from the AB govt? Anyone with a passing knowledge of global oil and gas supply knows that the oil sands are "uncompetitive" because of the costs of producing oil from bitumen, and the very high environmental liabilities.
1017 2018-01-02 21:51:47 It is no big deal to follow a few flakes and it’s easy to unfollow and even block those who are irritating.  Thank You for taking all the time you spend on the lists to help us MAGA 
1018 2018-01-02 21:51:43 こたつなんかより、暖房が入ってても少し寒いかな？って部屋で半袖になって毛布に包まる方が最高に気持ちいいから。こたつ入ったこと無いけど。
1019 2018-01-02 21:51:36 Oh yeah that is a fact. But I must say I am actually shocked that you still have oil trains. Could you tell me a distance between two cities and the time they take to get there?
1020 2018-01-02 21:51:25 Followed all, as I do all MAGA Patriots.
1021 2018-01-02 21:51:12 Oil of oregano.  Kills everything.
1022 2018-01-02 21:50:59 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
1023 2018-01-02 21:50:58 You've been arguing it can't be done, it's to early to try yet China has already beaten their goal to green energy switch while we in North America still wade in oil. They have more electrical vehicles there now then we've even thought of producing because we focus on oil.
1024 2018-01-02 21:50:35 Iknowwww I’m getting older cuz one of my Christmas gifts was money for an oil changeand I was soooo thankful
1025 2018-01-02 21:50:31 They’ve perfected their guise, easy to make a mistake...thanks for your dedication...#MAGA
1026 2018-01-02 21:50:29 Hearing news about 2018 being a blue year. Or about who’s going to win where, is getting tiring, already. 

Slavery in Libya. Loss of influence in the world by the USA. Blaming Trina for selling oil to North Korea when it’s Russia. Far more relevant news

@MSNBC @CNN @nbc @ABC
1027 2018-01-02 21:50:28 I think Dan's saying BTC will kill off #Mantorno but I disagree. Those dev communities are like oil and water. Historically, ponies and honeybadgers don't date that much
1028 2018-01-02 21:50:11 Coconut oil really lit 
1029 2018-01-02 21:50:04 Since you like going to car meets @DestElexiss change my oil

1032 2018-01-02 21:49:53 Revolutionary activity in Iran underscores the importance of low oil prices in containing Persian expansionism. People suffering as funds flow out of country to other Shia. Pipelines and fracking in US will also limit Iran's ability to ramp up nuclear efforts
1033 2018-01-02 21:49:44 Tonight’s Grilled Flatbread Pizza
Grilled Chicken, Artichoke Hearts, Feta, Mozzarella, & Olive Oil…$12.50
1034 2018-01-02 21:49:30 put rosemary & olive oil in my hair so hopefully I'll feel good and cool in a few hours
1035 2018-01-02 21:49:24 Be careful what you wish for. You want your country’s infrastructure destroyed like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria? American oil interests will be happy to send missiles to get their hands on the Caspian Sea oil fields. They don’t care about democracy, just profit.
1036 2018-01-02 21:49:17 Y’all don’t understand how much I loveeee my showers. Being in a warm shower with soaps and shower gels that smell divine and then moisturizing my skin in creams and oil and top it all off with Hermès perfume? Nothing better.
1037 2018-01-02 21:49:02 Vaped in my moms face*

1042 2018-01-02 21:48:38 Coconut oil fixes everything, heartbroken? Put some coconut oil on that shit
1043 2018-01-02 21:48:36 Iranian people better not trust Trump, he wants your oil. Keep him out of the uprising.
1044 2018-01-02 21:48:14 Whoa. Mind blowing. I trust snake oil more than Fox News #ThingsITrustMoreThanFoxNews
1045 2018-01-02 21:48:13 Hell yeah! Already there picked up MCT oil this weekend
1046 2018-01-02 21:48:12 Most women I know would rather watch a house full of men.
Hot men.
Hot men with no shirts.
And lots of baby oil.
1047 2018-01-02 21:48:10 That’s was my point. They were chasing heart, physicality and grit which forgot the quality of play part for a while.
1048 2018-01-02 21:48:08 That one tweet has me wanting to get some lavender oil for my diffuser
1049 2018-01-02 21:48:07 Terranova's super food crops : olive oil, almonds, honey : #ProudToFeedAustralia
1050 2018-01-02 21:48:07 Yes please do your own vetting. I did make a few mistakes on this list. I will try to tweak the list more everytime I do it.
1051 2018-01-02 21:48:02 rosemary and Olive oil kettle cooked potato chips taste exactly like fried chicken skin
1052 2018-01-02 21:48:01 The mechanic gave me a free oil change because he felt bad about my “weight”, and I’m just thinking “I’m fine with the way I look, thanks”
1053 2018-01-02 21:48:01 Blaming Digital Duo for every evil under the sun? Hiyo ni siasa! 
We praise Rwanda & castigate Paul Kagame as not being "democratic" in the same sentence. Discipline & our brand of "democracy" are like oil & water.
We must revert all "political universities" to tertiary colleges.
1054 2018-01-02 21:47:18 I felt like i supported bigness - big oil and big companies who made big money running those wars. #RadioFreeVermont #whatiread
1055 2018-01-02 21:47:11 Definitely some steel traffic possibly for the shipyards and oil rig module manufacturing. Lots of scrap metal went from the port too as well as aggregates, grain & timber. Much of the infrastructure remains in situ.
1056 2018-01-02 21:47:09 Don’t do it Utah. Romney will sell out Utah’s national parks to appease dt and the oil companies.
1057 2018-01-02 21:47:01 this girl just asked me if the oil in her car would freeze...... i don’t even know what to say
1058 2018-01-02 21:46:44 Got my registration and oil changed today 
1059 2018-01-02 21:46:39 but I am intrigued by the "in the most malevolent way" line re. black oil
1060 2018-01-02 21:46:38 Unregulated capitalism: The worst that happens is people buy harmless snake oil & learn not to.

Socialist regulations: The worst that happens is hundreds of thousand die hopeless, needless, awful deaths.

Pick one.

And really, take your time. Because it's a tough call. 
1061 2018-01-02 21:46:28 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
1062 2018-01-02 21:46:24 ...and patchouli oil.
1063 2018-01-02 21:46:21 Oil is on it's way out. Why won't people get that. We waffled on our leadership of green energy and now China is trying to lead. WTF. Get oil out of your head.
1064 2018-01-02 21:46:13 Nothing wrong with size, as long as the guys can still play.
1065 2018-01-02 21:46:03 According to Ms. Silverman the sexual misconduct accused on the left  is so much better and she is sad to see them go. But the sexual misconduct accused on the right should be boiled in oil. #fairness
1066 2018-01-02 21:45:57 Export some ..so the “energy independence” mantra isn’t true? Imagine that , being lied to by the oil industry.
1067 2018-01-02 21:45:56 What is the oil spec and name?
1068 2018-01-02 21:45:56 We have big money ties to Saudi Arabia, a big one is the 11% of our oil we get annually from SA, and at a good price too. They’re the top producer for the United States in oil. Pakistan isn’t a threat,if SA and us got into it, both countries would suffer greatly.
1069 2018-01-02 21:45:37 // Make an oil that smells like roses.
Make it a challenge!

1071 2018-01-02 21:45:23 Your government banned offshore oil drilling. That is very good news for your tourism sector. #ttot
1072 2018-01-02 21:45:20 I just brought my car in to get the oil changed and they ended up doing $500 worth of repairs... rip my bank account
1073 2018-01-02 21:45:10 me too and olbas oil not working. If you find a solution let me know #getwellsoon
1074 2018-01-02 21:45:07 taxes, why credit score is so important, how to do simple labor, changing oil, fixing stuff at your house. how to buy a house adn stuff like that
1075 2018-01-02 21:45:04 Love you.. & send me some weed oil
1076 2018-01-02 21:44:47 Thanks man! The plan was to do futures after this cycle, I have two accounts one doesn’t offer futures the other I’m trying to build up 30k before dipping into futures
1077 2018-01-02 21:44:35 It all depends on the PRICE of oil, at $30 barrel we may not get our $800 equity investment back and lose $500M + on royalties - bad deal, too risky!
1078 2018-01-02 21:44:33 First Tuesday of 2018: I Am Going to Eat This Entire Box of Rosemary & Olive Oil Triscuits™
1079 2018-01-02 21:44:07 *me getting an oil change*

Guy: “what service do you want?”
Me: “oil change”
Guy: “what year is it?”
Me: “well it’s 2018 now”
Guy: “what”
Me: “...”
*grandpa laughing in passenger seat*
Me: “oh 1992”
1080 2018-01-02 21:44:06 Burn it in a oil burner. All you need is a few drops with water & by the morning you should be better xx
1081 2018-01-02 21:44:01 just got a damn $70 oil change
1082 2018-01-02 21:43:54 Prosciutto with ricotta and hot peppers in oil?  Love that place!
1083 2018-01-02 21:43:52 Trump’s just mad they may start transacting with Yuan in oil purchases.
1084 2018-01-02 21:43:52 It's quite costly and has significant environmental impact to overbuild pipelines for such an occasional event.  Of course the massive fuel oil use is costly also.
In either way, cheap gas becomes within a short period far less cheap than it's sold to be.
1085 2018-01-02 21:43:49 LOL!  Coconut oil works wonders on the skin.  Rub it up.  Hehe!
1086 2018-01-02 21:43:34 Warranty oil changes? If not you fucked up
1087 2018-01-02 21:43:31 Best feeling is when your car gets a new oil change lol... new car who dis
1088 2018-01-02 21:43:19 at jiffy lube getting my oil changed. dang this place is packed boo
1089 2018-01-02 21:43:12 If you like a lot of mustard oil on your rugelach, join our club!
1090 2018-01-02 21:43:12 Low government funding, investor hesitancy and low oil prices have combined to limit the growth of the industry.
1091 2018-01-02 21:43:11 These folk at Valvoline done got over on me! I should've let Tez do my oil change! I hope they don't bother my weed either 
1092 2018-01-02 21:43:09 a hell of a lot of aquaphor mixed with hydrocortisone, especially overnight! and for my face i had been using jojoba oil
1093 2018-01-02 21:43:04 That is. Andrew. Because the world is moving away from oil so this move by Trudeau is justified. Andrew wants us all to double down on outdated oul which would make us not leaders.
1094 2018-01-02 21:43:01 I can assure you I have spent less on taxis than anyone spends on car insurance. Let alone petrol, car parking fees, oil changes, mot, emissions tax or repairs. So if you can afford a car you can afford parking.
1095 2018-01-02 21:42:59 A2: We always vote for Belize in any category obviously! Will say after government voted to ban offshore oil drilling, best time to come dive the Belize Barrier Reef! #TTOT
1096 2018-01-02 21:42:56 @Tamrius95 uses a beard oil and a balm on his now. Oil to help the dry skin he gets under his beard, and balm to shape it.
1097 2018-01-02 21:42:50 okAY listen, Get any flour of your choice, put it in a mixing bowl, add some oil, the water and stir! Then add kimchi & stir!
1098 2018-01-02 21:42:48 Curious: what the use no oil label for exactly
1099 2018-01-02 21:42:43 Iran’s sitting on oil, minerals n other national assets, 4season country w great tourism potential, academics..., which could enhance the economy, yet overlooked/misused by the govt, however U can’t merely blame it on them as we have social responsibilities as civilians as well
1100 2018-01-02 21:42:34 Could the system we have for approving treatments be better? Sure.

But NO SYSTEM at all leads to snake oil salesmen profiting off the desperation of the sick. I reject that as madness.
1101 2018-01-02 21:42:23 Today in Mykayla tries to adult: getting an oil change so my car doesn’t die
1102 2018-01-02 21:42:20 Women don't temp me. LOL I've been on a health kick so if I do use oil it will either be avocado oil or olive oil.
1103 2018-01-02 21:42:16 Confirmed. Also a gallon of peanut oil.
1104 2018-01-02 21:42:10 THE OIL CHANGE WAS WHIPPING THE HOUSE'S ASS
1105 2018-01-02 21:42:05 Probably that which is not a constant, namely that the stuff in Alberta is not really oil but bituminous sands, which wear out equipment and pipelines much faster and are generally much more expensive to process and convert to a usable product.
1106 2018-01-02 21:42:04 Enviromentalism is not only good for the planet but is also sound strategic doctrine for America's future! (Oil is a finite resource)! Just saying...
1107 2018-01-02 21:42:04 If you have peanuts and a blender, you could just whizz up the right weight of peanuts to make a handy  replacement. Add a touch of oil if they don't want to form a paste at first. XXXX
1108 2018-01-02 21:41:57 Yes oil trains, Several locomotives and about 150 tank cars.
1109 2018-01-02 21:41:54 Podestra made millions when Putin s oil company bought stock in the Podestra  brothers oil companies while serving as chief of staff to obummers White House & Hillarys campaign
1110 2018-01-02 21:41:49 Not really, you have the net, bait and line, go to the stream.
Do some research, remember Obubra, palm oil and Okasan
1111 2018-01-02 21:41:02 Oil prices 
1112 2018-01-02 21:40:45 Baby don't be angry na. Small player 
1113 2018-01-02 21:40:39 This week's Fed History posts will review the oil shocks of the 1970s and the Great Inflation of which they were a part. (2/2)
1114 2018-01-02 21:40:22 POT legal just about everywhere now.....Have some tea with a little Cannabis Oil..

1117 2018-01-02 21:40:02 He was until he nationalizes Iran's oil.
1118 2018-01-02 21:40:02 If only @FatKidDeals had a deal on emulsified mct oil 
1119 2018-01-02 21:39:50 Idk I've never had but one but all I know is cartlidge or whatever is what stinks worse than anything bc it's a hole that's not supposed to be there and it gives a weird discharge of all the things like oil or make up and that's what's the stinky stuff is
1120 2018-01-02 21:39:33 Interesting idea but will never fly given the administration’s love affair with coal and oil industry. The more carbon the better in their mind.
1121 2018-01-02 21:39:28 And you don't care that your sources get money from oil companies. You don't care that they are funded by industries with a vested interest in DENYING climate science so they can carry on selling fossil fuels. YOU SHOULD CARE AND YOU SHOULD FIND UNBIASED SOURCES.
1122 2018-01-02 21:39:15 I agree and plus not all of us slick our shit down/know how, i only oil tf out my edges and my shit still looks like this once i put it in a pony tail 
1123 2018-01-02 21:38:48 Hahaha true. Eventually they always run out of OPM. 

Other People's Money.

Then whoopsie that didn't work like we planned. Oil prices dropped.... damn.

1126 2018-01-02 21:38:25 Yeah, that's BS. Fact is, that oil can be a volatile commodity. LONG ago we should have been supporting the industry while developing others so that the worldwide effects of such things like oil prices don't affect Alberta so badly. I blame the Province and the Feds to a degree.

1132 2018-01-02 21:37:48 Also the USA is now one of the largest petroleum producers in the world thanks to the Dakota and Keystone pipelines. This has dropped the worldwide price of crude oil which has helped defund ISIS and throw the Iranian economy into chaos hopefully instigating a regime change.

1135 2018-01-02 21:37:18 Get off your high-horse and look around, it was the people that were affected financially by the sanctions. The regime stayed put while the sanctions wore out the people themselves. But of course living in a country that sells oil in exchange for wealth you wouldn’t understand.
1136 2018-01-02 21:37:16 This is all staged between Trump and the Prince of Saudi Arabia. It's why Kushner has been over there for several weekends. Saudi want civil war in Iran so they can't compete with oil sales. Trump owes Saudi billions so he does their bidding and people will get killed.

1183 2018-01-02 21:31:17 As I recall, Chavez promised socialism to the Venezuelan voters & Hollywood & liberals praised the move. Then, oil dropped to below $50 a barrel. Maduro took over as a socialist dictator when the gravy train dried up. Many voters love socialism's freebies till the bill comes due.

1253 2018-01-02 21:23:01 I stopped reading once you said "Oil is Finite".

Oil is NOT Finite which was a myth invented by the Rockefeller's
1254 2018-01-02 21:22:59 Then you are looking in the wrong place. Conspiracy theory websites, right wing organisations infamous for accepting money from big oil and TV weather men etc. You won't find the truth that way.
1255 2018-01-02 21:22:57 Although, he is not in the same elite class as Nik Lidström was I would argue that Sekera's importance to the Oilers rivals what Lidström's importance was to the Red Wiings in terms of when he was out of the lineup. I also think he will play as long as Lidström and Markov.

1258 2018-01-02 21:22:50 Again, not trying to suggest it's a sound direction to take but he still has Wheeler & company, got quality back for Kane. Compare that to what Chiarelli received in return for ALL the one-time "key pieces" he moved?

1261 2018-01-02 21:22:40 indeed, and the consumption driven dominance of global growth likely supports transport demand (and thus oil products). tho I'm curious to see how much price increases over the last two years impact choices. especially now that even most oil producers now passing on higher costs
1262 2018-01-02 21:22:38 You’re misinformed , There are 9 oil trains going through my area every day. They are from the Bakken in ND going to WA. Then on a boat to China.None of it stays here.

1265 2018-01-02 21:22:24 whenever you feel that your lips are no longer moisturized, just apply coconut oil. They also sell pure coconut oil as chapstick at Walgreens or CVS so that might be easier
1266 2018-01-02 21:22:17 COCONUT OIL WORKS WONDERS. If ur not w it get w it
1267 2018-01-02 21:22:10 Salt... is not a shoveless snow removal system... thankfully coconut oil helped my dog that licks her paws... while useful to melt ice, killing next years grass, repairing the concrete, rugs and flooring mess.. how much more cost and work is that..yep ppl slip, so do it 10x a day
1268 2018-01-02 21:21:58 It's about oil. Power. Enemies are salivating at Iranian oil.
1269 2018-01-02 21:21:54 Of course my bougie ass bought the ONE Jetta with special air and oil filters. 

At least I’m not the owner of the Subaru that the mechanic said, “sounds like total shit.” 
1270 2018-01-02 21:21:33 Thanks Bud.  I don't know why they would want to board the "enemy" train anyhow!  Lol
1271 2018-01-02 21:21:21 I use it, and like it a lot. I use Gibson Beard Oil. They have a lot of different scents, but the one I use is called "Manscaper". It smells really good, and allows me to manage my beard well. Additionally, they sell a beard balm, but I don't like the way that smells.
1272 2018-01-02 21:21:18 yup i put some near my nostrils lol. got my essential oils in the diffuser then i’m gonna steam my face w| eucalyptus oil before bed lol
1273 2018-01-02 21:20:54 Investments are being made, just not in Canada. Interesting that oil prices are the same astound the world. So if that's the constant, what could be pushing those investments out of Canada? Hmm...
1274 2018-01-02 21:20:51 Had to educate the waitress at Zizzis because they ran out of chilli oil so they made their own but they didn’t heat the chilli in order to properly infuse the oil therefore it was fairly bland
1275 2018-01-02 21:20:44 A service only qualified people should perform??  Like what?  Self serve drinks?  Putting air in your tires?  Changing the oil?
1276 2018-01-02 21:20:44 Is this oil in the background? :D
1277 2018-01-02 21:20:39 Fortunately no radioactive fallout, no blazing oil rig....
1278 2018-01-02 21:20:29 Black oil coming back in 2018 season. Now that is BIG News.
1279 2018-01-02 21:20:19 Did you oil your pan :0/
1280 2018-01-02 21:20:16 Hey crazy lunatic... the Dems started DACA! You only say these lies Bc you are trying to hold dreamers hostage to get a stupid effing wall that won't do shit! Also, why aren't you mad at Russia for aiding NK w/ oil? Weird??
1281 2018-01-02 21:19:52 Do you know, will the new legislation effect the growing/production/sales  of CBD oil?
1282 2018-01-02 21:19:49 her jet will drop out of sky without fracking...she burn more oil in 1 year....than I do in a lifetime....
1283 2018-01-02 21:19:48 So true! Liberals should stop controlling the price of oil around the world
1284 2018-01-02 21:19:43 Everything about my body is dry af. All I want to do is bathe in oil but my plumbing / bathtub is terrible.
1285 2018-01-02 21:19:30 Getting a oil change in the winter

1288 2018-01-02 21:19:09 They’re actually oily because they have no fur for the oil to get absorbed into. This is what I hear 
1289 2018-01-02 21:18:53 In Boston PC made numerous poor trades and locked the team into too many bad contracts. Much is made of the one Stanley Cup, but he also did not build a team for long term success.
1290 2018-01-02 21:18:51 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
1291 2018-01-02 21:18:51 Real rates and the price of oil.
1292 2018-01-02 21:18:46 oh also tuna is ur bff, really good protein, full of good stuff like fish oil etc. very good for your integumentary system (hair skin and nails)
1293 2018-01-02 21:18:43 Round Mound of oil price rebound *BOOM*
1294 2018-01-02 21:18:20 10° truly feels much warmer than -2°... but the oil in my hair still froze walking half a block (with a hat on!)
1295 2018-01-02 21:18:15 Friend: Hey, are you busy? 

Me: No, what's up? 

Narrator: But she had been busy neglecting work and screaming at digital oil paint for the way it mixed.
1296 2018-01-02 21:18:14 I live to beat the rotation. Bought $fcx under 4 when oil was at 25 barrel and they were calling for 10.
1297 2018-01-02 21:18:11 Yaassss shed it gurllll. May it flourish abundantly in 2018  Bring the anointing oil and slatherrrrrrrrrrrrr it 
1298 2018-01-02 21:17:56 Deregulation. Super. Now fracking can go on un regulated & pollute rivers & streams & maybe the next big oil spill will too. Drilling on federal park lands & Anwar - What could go wrong? Unless you own an petroleum company, this ones not for you. Either.
1299 2018-01-02 21:17:52 I make mine without the ham & it's excellent.  Use a good olive oil to cook your onions & celery before adding beans & stock.  

Yes, I'm actually ALLERGIC to pork. Sigh.
1300 2018-01-02 21:17:47 The entire team of stakeholders has to pay back $14B, not "we". We own 5% of that. Crunch the final numbers based on reservoir estimates and tell me what we stand to profit? A lot. Oil details all known beforehand
1301 2018-01-02 21:17:46 I'm not kicking or screaming. 20 or so "clean coal" plants (remember those quotes) are not an energy revolution. Once those coal jobs go--and go they will--the appeal will be down to cost. This method is a boondoggle for Big Oil; a bandaid for their billionaires.
1302 2018-01-02 21:17:23 Calculated, but impulsive.  It's possible he went ahead with the tweet without knowing if Russia was supplying oil at all, and we've learned to expect he won't go back and concede he was ill informed if it doesn't fit the narrative.
1303 2018-01-02 21:17:16 The only veg in the house tonight  was cauliflower, so I roasted florettes with sliced garlic, lemon zest & thyme. Stirred in some cubes of stale sourdough for crunch and doused in olive oil.
1304 2018-01-02 21:17:12 I will take the Talbot for 2 picks any day, as I think much of the problem has been the team in front of him. The rest of the trades etc not so much. The Hall for Larsson thing has already been beat to death.
1305 2018-01-02 21:16:56 Need me some coconut oil
1306 2018-01-02 21:16:49 Still 10,000,000 gallons of oil, on the gulf floor, that nobody’s accountable for,??
1307 2018-01-02 21:16:49 Wild growth oil
1308 2018-01-02 21:16:47 The dude at walmart who was changing my oil asked me to pop my hood and I had to tell him I didn't know how to do that. He was not amused

1310 2018-01-02 21:16:37 Time for the coaching staff to go. Wouldn't mind seeing Nelson back for the rest of the year ..though that would be highly unlikely...I think the oil got the wrong Todd to coach.
1311 2018-01-02 21:16:24 Haven't started it yet and this tweet made me a lil sad.
1312 2018-01-02 21:16:08 might fw the black castor oil but if I get bumps on my face I’m hooking with every single one of y’all that recommended
1313 2018-01-02 21:15:55 7 draft choices in two years were traded away or given as compensation & that comprises part of the problem with few quality young players on the horizon, 2 for PC, 1 for Todd, 2 for Reinhart, 2 for Talbot and Eberle for Strome trade that stank from the moment it was made.
1314 2018-01-02 21:15:53 us gov has for you yah the d silly politics oil exactly indeed all we do is shoot ppl nice prospect yah I know ships will be at anchors lots less temporery solution  yah otherwise stoways
1315 2018-01-02 21:15:53 I haven't taken CBD oil but plan to ask my consultant about it too. Hear others have great things to say about it but would rather seek medical advice first #lupuschat
1316 2018-01-02 21:15:49 Oh, the Golden Age of British SF TV was working simply bizarre miracle on the smell of half an oily rag.  And don't ask where the oil came from...
1317 2018-01-02 21:15:48 With regards to a cancer treatment, 2) Foods that cause cancer (e.g. trans fatty acids [margarine, French fries and virtually every other processed food you buy], aspartame [Diet Coke, NutraSweet, Equal, etc.], MSG, polyunsaturated oils [e.g. corn oil], etc.)
1318 2018-01-02 21:15:29 Forgot how therapeutic working with oil pastels is
1319 2018-01-02 21:15:28 If fish oil is as powerful as they say, seems like the fish would’ve escaped.
1320 2018-01-02 21:15:24 Doing the right thing is different from working on an oil rig or crab fishing boat. So long as we have scarcity, I do not see communism working.

Though telling retail customers to fuck themselves would be fun.
1321 2018-01-02 21:15:17 We have to pay off $14 Billion + interest to get our money back and this heavy oil is up to 15% less valuable than WTI which means we could be 10-15 yrs before we break even. Meanwhile, we could lose up to $600 million on royalties during this period - too risky, never again!

1327 2018-01-02 21:14:12 Exactly. Chips cooked in beef dripping now ok. I've hurled the sunflower oil into the sea
1328 2018-01-02 21:14:01 If PR had oil, copper, Russians, we’d be there in a heartbeat
1329 2018-01-02 21:13:58 oh right it’s been a while since we’ve had a catif it was better with the cheap food,go back to using that and see if it does him any good?maybe a combination of that food and using CBD oil for a few weeks will help! but i know how frustrating this situation is
1330 2018-01-02 21:13:55 I agree. That would be utter stupidity.
1331 2018-01-02 21:13:54 Someone in London has a Report on the Scottish Atlantic Margin oil and gas potential. It is inconceivable to think otherwise. Like the McCrone Report, it is being conveniently `concealed` at this point in time.
1332 2018-01-02 21:13:33 ~ cut taxes temp except for the rich
~ Other countries already said no negotiations for TPP, NAFTA, PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD, or IRAN DEAL
~ approved Keystone & already had bad oil leak
~ 1.7 Million Jobs added as of 12/8/17? Really prove it
~ Lost leadership in world negotiations.
1333 2018-01-02 21:13:28 Snap that’s all I can take because of problems with my kidneys and have take effervescent ones. Have you ever had CBD oil. I haven’t but keep on reading about it and need to ask my consultant. My Dr also agreed I should have Vit D supplements #lupuschat
1334 2018-01-02 21:13:27 Oil consumption will decrease expotentially as the #EV industry consumes the combustion engine technology. They are already worried about a 15% decrease in oil sales. Oil prices will just continue to rise as demand decreases. Logical.

1335 2018-01-02 21:13:24 The dollar isn’t based on gold anymore, it’s based off of oil exchange. That’s why this country hasn’t switched to anyhing that’s more eco friendly because our economy would crumble without oil

1347 2018-01-02 21:12:42 Hey @Wegmans maybe don't use a different basting oil on your prepared foods than what we can get on the shelf. Soybean oil can be an allergen.

1349 2018-01-02 21:12:03 20p on a litre now, fuel is at least that much cheaper than it was 4-5 years ago. If there's an oil price explosion duty can be cut but at the moment it is too cheap to drive.

1358 2018-01-02 21:10:44 It's failed, it was all started so that US can get gas\oil pipeline from Saudi and Qatar through Syria space to EU, but it can't happen while Assad at the top. You really think that US give a dime about refugees running to EU? US just dont give a f about humans
1359 2018-01-02 21:10:38 Thinking about the same WA experience. That is WHY we must embrace the "pan-partisan" solution. The enviros can be as parochial as the oil people.

1373 2018-01-02 21:08:42 Dude, for the next cycle use futures instead. Way better. ETNS and ETFS can see you lose profit even on good swings. If you need help, just ask me. I got you.
1374 2018-01-02 21:08:33 Didn't do anything to my face still have the pimples and it's too oil
1375 2018-01-02 21:08:32 It depends on what kind of oil they're putting in, how many miles you've got on your car, how new your car is, what kind of an engine you've got, and so on.

1380 2018-01-02 21:07:50 Oil and gas are not energy. Burning oil and gas can create varying amounts of work, depending on the engine's efficiency
1381 2018-01-02 21:07:48 I am super curious how the Conservative government is going to manipulate world oil prices to ensure Canada's oil industry never ever ever experiences any downturns that sort of comes with the territory with natural resource commodities. I guess we are going to subsidize forever?
1382 2018-01-02 21:07:36 Has anyone had luck with CBD Oil?  Trying to stay off the Alleve and other pharms.
1383 2018-01-02 21:07:27 @HondaCustSvc my new civic has 10,000, drives perfect, but dealership talked me into an allignment when I went in for my oil change today. Did I just get ripped off?
1384 2018-01-02 21:07:25 @stoic_ackerman_  just got all the things I need to fix up my cleaning supplies. It's amazing how much a mix of Lemon juice, Oxiclean, Lavender, and baking powder can do! It's amazing on furniture and carpet. For wood floors I use any scented oil, Enamel mix, and baking soda.
1385 2018-01-02 21:07:20 ``The Scottish Atlantic Margin is the next global hot-spot for oil and gas exploration in the 21st century``; and these are just a few of the quotes from oil industry experts and petroleum academics on the overall potential of Scottish oil and gas.

1393 2018-01-02 21:06:35 @EPA probably shouldn’t eliminate records. Cars are the bigger problem. You should stop pandering to big oil and gas and help us save the planet. Or not/ whatevs. You guys couldn’t give two craps about future generations oh well.

1399 2018-01-02 21:06:10 To stories, there are always three sides you see,
Yours, theirs and the truth, it be.
Look for root causes of strife and toil
And you'll find it's all about controlling oil.
If oil was no more,

"Carbon dioxide injected into the oil field will increase its production, and with oil prices at $50 a barrel or higher, the plant is economical, according to NRG spokesman David Knox. Some of the carbon dioxide then remains sequestered in the oil field after (recovery).

1406 2018-01-02 21:05:39 I hate getting my oil changed. Especially in rural east Texas.
1407 2018-01-02 21:05:33 Without Oil Money they would be nothing and without Dodgy Russian Chelsea would also be nothing. We are doing very well to be up there.
1408 2018-01-02 21:05:32 i called about an oil change & i got here and they said that they were scheduled for tomorrow and i was like i literally just called and you said i could wait lol

1410 2018-01-02 21:05:27 Started a no added oil, no added sugar vegan diet last week. No calorie counting, just eating when I am hungry and until i feel satisfied because like you said, I don't want to make it a punishment. Already feeling good, hopefully I'll drop a few extra pounds along the way.

1423 2018-01-02 21:04:07 Because trump throws a few bones to the oil/natural gas industry - it does not change my low opinion of the man - I’m not bought by that crap - we are getting only what the establishment GOP will give us - and they are fickle friends
1424 2018-01-02 21:03:56 Yes. Oil from Iran is subject to restrictions by the EU and the US but its supply volume impacts on total Oil reserves, with opportunist speculators exploiting prices whenever there is an excuse they can use

d) There is a dangerous bank in front of the sub if you read "25m" as depth in a rippled sea of 20m waves.
e) The sub was stuck with battery problems. Electrical ones lead to unability to communicate, to go up, sail, etc.
f) No floating oil on surface. Pretty strange.
1427 2018-01-02 21:03:42 Being an Iranian, I see that US is now in the exact same trap that they made for us in this last 80 years. Every time we fought for freedom they traded us for oil and used our deepest vulnerabilities to make a trap of populism out of it for us. Religion was ours, racism is yours!

1431 2018-01-02 21:03:29 one of my dogs used to do the same thing and it got to the point where it was constantly infected. we used CBD oil for a few weeks as well as colloidal silverwater on the spot where she was licking and somehow she stopped so maybe try that?maybe it works for him as well

1445 2018-01-02 21:02:05 Behold, a black horse; and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard something like a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not damage the oil and the wine.

1448 2018-01-02 21:01:43 Too bad, one will never cease to wonder what Nigeria is doing with windfalls of money made from oil during all the gulf wars. Electricity shdn't be scarce in that country.

1453 2018-01-02 21:01:27 I recommend oregano oil. Usually take the first time you start feeling bad. If it's full blown take to recover quicker. Buy the drops and put under your tongue for as long as you can stand before drinking water...swear by this
1454 2018-01-02 21:01:26 If you have type 4 hair and you’re concerned about your edges having to be slicked down, I recommend castor oil on your edges to help make them fuller and less separated from your natural hairline when you wear a bun. 
1455 2018-01-02 21:01:25 So 1 carrot (cut to 1/2 cubes), 1 celery (cut into 1/2 cubes), 1 leek (sliced into 1/2 wide rounds) and 1 red chilli, add a hand full of picked thyme leaves and a hand full of chopped sage.

Pop all in a pan with some oil for 8 min on med heat.

1481 2018-01-02 20:59:05 Yes, somehow more tankers on the west coast is a big no no as is drilling in the arctic. But foreign oil flows into Eastern Canada via ocean-going vessels that don't run on fairy dust. OPEC sheiks & Russian oligarchs must take us for fools.

Let's not forget ones like that think "Everyone wants to be like me & they're all jealous" Mr. Donald Trump serves oil companies.
1490 2018-01-02 20:57:33 Wineman perhaps maybe you should educate yourself. American companies draw Alberta oil and ship by train to the States where Canada $buy$ our own sm amount oil back. We get $30> for every barrel.
1491 2018-01-02 20:57:13 U.S. #oil production surged to a 46-year record in October. The Energy Department said the nation's output of crude  oil jumped 1.8 percent to 9.64 million barrels a day. Morgan Stanley  said shale drillers pumped at the fastest rate in nearly three years.  #OOTT
1492 2018-01-02 20:57:13 If your burning oil it could be clogged tips and depending on age of unit could be very dangerous as fuel will continue to pour over smoldering tip causing smoke and carbon monoxide. If you have propane the regulator can freeze outside causing very dangerous conditions.

1505 2018-01-02 20:55:40 If we abide, there’s nothing to be concerned about. Hear it from Jesus in Jn 15. Yet many will fall away from their faith before He comes, like the five foolish virgins who run out of oil and aren’t ready when the door is shut. We should be sober, not cocky or complacent.

1524 2018-01-02 20:53:25 As families gathered to celebrate the holidays, the Trump Administration was busy making it easier for oil and gas pollution to harm our children's health, and mocking climate change after a record-breaking year of hurricanes and wildfires.

The US would also benefit by cutting down a Russian ally and maybe increasing our oil supply.  But let the NeoCons talk about humanitarianism.
1534 2018-01-02 20:52:37 Omoku is a major contributor to the nations economy and the people are living in fear on a daily basis due to insecurity Pls this should be a concern to the nation. If no peace, no oil and we loose investments. #Omoku
1535 2018-01-02 20:52:16 To a degree, sure, there's a multitude of porn that's sports themed, but most aren't about men pretend fighting with oil over their bodies covered in tights.
1536 2018-01-02 20:52:14 Who give oil change in Talladega for da low ? 
1537 2018-01-02 20:52:12 Hey #Feminists - Y'all want equality? YOU get up in the night and check out that strange noise!!! Change your OWN damn snow tires! Check your OWN dipstick! Actually PUT oil in the car!

1539 2018-01-02 20:51:57 How are those sanctions going? Why is Chinese oil flowing into NK? Could it be that NO ONE takes you seriously? Since you brought up sanctions how are those Russian sanctions going? #TrumpRussia
1540 2018-01-02 20:51:50 Great point. Not a fan of either approach but in these two situations, the Cheveldayoff approach is much preferred and keeps one from trying to outsmart himself.
1541 2018-01-02 20:51:43 Why was the ban necessary in the 1st place. Oil Prices fell and we had issues of demand and supply for forex. CBN had to prune the demand list down. The banned 41 didn't devalue the Naira Mr.

1544 2018-01-02 20:51:21 Population explosion is the least of Nigeria’s woes as a nation, if it were. As regions that ain’t populated aren’t well off, Nigeria’s problems were borne more out of laziness and lack of strategic thinking, b/c oil and corruption have been with us for long.

1549 2018-01-02 20:51:03 Wanting war with Iran is different from wanting to uninstall the regime. The Deep State has played both sides of many wars. Murdoch, Cheney, Rothschild all own Genie Oil which had plans to extract oil from Golan Heights. You & I know wars are often about grabbing resources
1550 2018-01-02 20:51:01 The oil marketers want fuel sold for 170 naira per litre,before you say jack Robinson,it is gonna be 200 naira per litre
1551 2018-01-02 20:50:41 The industry average profit margin for oil companies is 6.1% and they don't pretend to be non profit.
1552 2018-01-02 20:50:27 We only consume full fats. Butter, olive oil, coconut oil. 
Also no artificial sweeteners and very little sweetened sodas.

The answer isn't over processed dead food. The answer is moderation.
1553 2018-01-02 20:50:26 The petco at park place has booties that fit my boxer mix really well and handled Canadian winters. Also coconut oil is amazing at healing any cracking and make sure all salt is off their feet.

1560 2018-01-02 20:49:09 what if you switch lotion for olive oil and butter for vaseline

1569 2018-01-02 20:48:21 I feel more shame getting an oil change and hearing the guys talking or laughing through the glass windows than I do getting a pedicure.
1570 2018-01-02 20:48:15 The Oil's fancy stats suggest both bad luck but also a lack of finishing ability imo, but I might be wrong on that

1585 2018-01-02 20:46:14 Important to note that the Petro (Venezuelan national cryptocurrency) isn't fundamentally different from paper debt-currency.

Putting it on a blockchain doesn't require any less trust that the central bank can honor its debts and deliver the underlying goods (oil).

1595 2018-01-02 20:45:34 @Prashad_veggie Hey guys, I was just wondering if using coconut oil in your recipes would change how they work or is it best to use sunflower oil?
Thanks, Ben
1596 2018-01-02 20:45:30 LW: Its completely arbitrary. Instead, it simply amounts to a favor for Trumps friends in the oil and gas industry.
1597 2018-01-02 20:44:51 I did not have time to buy that oil for no damn $30
1598 2018-01-02 20:44:51 Somehow this is all about a play by Trump and Russia to get oil, natural gas, port access, or something else that will make them $$. They want to install their own puppet like the Shah, someone who is "good for business."

1622 2018-01-02 20:42:14 Just like WPG last year, our (adjusted) metrics right now are very good but with bad goaltending. It's not that straightforward of course, but we dug a hole early because we can't trust any of our goaltenders early on.

Good riddance.

1655 2018-01-02 20:39:45 What kind of oil?
1656 2018-01-02 20:39:41 I know there were some emergency shelters set up for the last cold wave. Also the oil delivery driver restrictions were temporarily lifted. (Per Governors DMV). We will continue to be vigilant. I am also meeting with GMP on Thursday AM and will discuss.
1657 2018-01-02 20:39:28 I said in-season injuries. According to Klefbom, his injury dates back to last season & Sekera's was there for all to see. If the GM decides to not address prior to the season, that's on him. Not sure what injury 97 had other than sickness.
1658 2018-01-02 20:39:21 So we get 5% of revenues plus 1% of gross until paid off then we get 5% + normal royalty rate + 6.5% when oil >$50/bbl.  yes?
1659 2018-01-02 20:39:17 why is it hat only NNPC declares losses while every other oil company makes huge profits.

1665 2018-01-02 20:38:11 Do you think she’s at all aware that the US helped destabilize Iran years ago by putting the Shah in power against the will of the people?  It sure did help the oil companies and their stockholders though.  We are still paying for past mistakes.  Time for change.
1666 2018-01-02 20:38:05 Really I’m pretty sure there will come a time we take what we can get.

1672 2018-01-02 20:37:20 What a great day to be a strong single independent woman 

Paid my electric bill: $180
Paid my car registration: $135
Paid my car insurance: $455
Bought more oil for furnace: $413
1673 2018-01-02 20:37:15 coconut oil
1674 2018-01-02 20:37:09 I'll use it to buy beard oil pls
1675 2018-01-02 20:37:05 It's 100% on chiarelli. This same coaching staff helped oil to a 103 pt season last year. The oilers lost a lot of depth this summer. Not just eberle. They lost pouliot (speed and pk), Hendricks (pk), pitlick (speed pk, played top 6 for oil start of last year), lander (pk).
1676 2018-01-02 20:36:57 They snorted and tried not to laugh. They held in a laugh until they coughed. They bursted out with laughter and cackles. "Frick.. I'm going to oil myself!" they managed to say and laughed loudly.
1677 2018-01-02 20:36:56 also I got these oil paints today and I LOVE THEM IVE BEEN PAINTING FOR AO MANY HOURS
1678 2018-01-02 20:36:53 It seems you have nothing to do during the day: it is not enough for you the oil you stole in past years and continue to steal around the world with the excuse of security and terrorism, only American invention? God one day will ask you about.... be human
1679 2018-01-02 20:36:37 I was able to add 800 shares of Dwt last few days, can’t wait to reap the downtrend!
1680 2018-01-02 20:36:36 Interesting that The Rocket Boy wants to negotiate after Oil Tanker Transfer was discovered 
1681 2018-01-02 20:36:26 As the old saying goes, throw a bunch of halftruths and fear against the wall and see what gets the #maga #dupes frothing at the mouth to sell your lead tainted snake oil. You infomercial hack.
1682 2018-01-02 20:36:24 I have a sweet tooth, but I never 'got' the appeal of funnel cakes.  All I taste is the cooking oil with some sugar.  Blech
1683 2018-01-02 20:36:19 The McDavid, Sekera and Klefbom injuries weren’t serious, Rob?
1684 2018-01-02 20:36:15 Remember that this was when a clueless oil executive was the top choice to be the Secretary of State.  I think Romney was willing to take the criticism if it gave him a chance to save the State Department.
1685 2018-01-02 20:36:15 Isn’t Iranian oil banned and embargoed to the e u ?
1686 2018-01-02 20:36:11 I think people need to relax a bit on Leon. Yes, he hasn't been as good but the concussion can't be overlooked and he's still likely to hit 70+ pts. Kopitar had 50 pts and scored like 12 goals.
1687 2018-01-02 20:36:07 Side note about Amazon Prime... I got 1L of coconut oil for 18 dollars. Yes. 18. WHAAAAAAAT?! Also - amazon video. Amazing.
1688 2018-01-02 20:36:05 I was told that you are broke 
Thats why you'll be running after iran's oil soon... gotachaaa

“yeah seems fine”
1691 2018-01-02 20:35:45 If you're doing Veganuary and you like coffee my strongest possible recommendation is that almond milk in coffee is RANK (mostly oil so it doesn't steam, just goes all tepid and limp) pls choose oat or bonsoy or a black coffee.
1692 2018-01-02 20:35:25 I couldn't get cc to work and couldn't figure out what Brody or Hardy were saying.  Other than that it was OK.  ha.
1693 2018-01-02 20:35:25 True. Time to live up to the reputation
1694 2018-01-02 20:35:24 Mine is oil incontinent and in early stages of head gasket failure. She's also very old and I don't know if putting her through surgery is the best option for her anymore!
1695 2018-01-02 20:35:23 yes castor oil. that's all my still packed ass had out
1696 2018-01-02 20:35:22 I like what I see 
1697 2018-01-02 20:35:20 Gotta walk before you run, I am a little disappointed in the Oil this year no doubt. Look at the Kings and Jets last year, both had decent teams, both missed the playoffs.
1698 2018-01-02 20:35:20  We have the same snack every session. We make air popped popcorn with olive oil and sea salt. It is our DM’s favorite and a little goes a long way. We also provide filtered water, tea or coffee.
Many people bring their own drinks. If you want more then popcorn they bring it.
1699 2018-01-02 20:35:19 I no even sure say I go get reach 10 points this gameweek 
1700 2018-01-02 20:35:18 A “full treatment”, or 60 grams High-grade Indica Cannabis Oil (so-called RSO or Rick Simpson Oil, a process) really ought to be Our FIRST choice, IF WE ARE ACTUALLY THINKING...in responding to ABY known cancers. Just DO IT...for the highest possible good. DON’T CONSUME SUGARS!!!
1701 2018-01-02 20:35:18 @BootstrapCook hi Jack, baking Q if that's okay please? If I was to make flapjacks with coconut oil instead of butter, would it be same quantities? Have big jar to use up.

1705 2018-01-02 20:35:01 On the upside just think of all the billions of pounds worth of arms Britain can sell to saudi Arabia because they will join in against Iran oh and oil and gas the West can confiscate in the name of democracy and freedom
1706 2018-01-02 20:35:00 Lol try saline spray and eucalyptus oil
1707 2018-01-02 20:34:45 I put coconut oil on me yesterday and it gave me a rash 
1708 2018-01-02 20:34:40 I admit I put a lil castor oil around my lips before I went out the door myself
1709 2018-01-02 20:34:39 i only use pantene beautiful lengths for my shampoo and conditioner. and then when i get out the shower i put coconut oil on my end

1712 2018-01-02 20:34:23 I can read it but it’s a disgusting premise and comment. He is inferring Trump is only interested in Iran’s oil. Not the people of Iran. It was a very racist tweet using vile slurs.
1713 2018-01-02 20:33:55 @HempInc just invested in your stock... with the CBD Oil rage and the legalization of Pot in more and more states...the time is NOW to get your company really moving! #cannabis #marijuana #legalization

1716 2018-01-02 20:33:47 Explosive start to 2018. Cannabis stocks on fire, oil stocks taking volume. Uranium miners too
1717 2018-01-02 20:33:39 DWT will be just fine..im not in ERY, but i have every confidence i will win the Oil trade..tried to get out against the trend and paid for it a little but..No biggy..when its all said and done, it will be forgotten and in plus..Timing and Sizing is everything!

1730 2018-01-02 20:32:05 I walked in to the Toyota dealership to get my oil changed and tires rotated and an old friend of mine was working there I haven’t seen in awhile, it was $88 to get done, as I come out to pay I get told it was free and no charge!!! Blessings! Happy new year forreal!!!

1736 2018-01-02 20:31:23 Twitter stream consensus developing: too much interest in oil and gold, not enough shorting. Hmm.
1737 2018-01-02 20:31:22 NK & China got caught smuggling oil.  This will be blocked.  Tell NK we're busy right now.  Let them stew.
1738 2018-01-02 20:31:22 Dollar’s going down! China is about to launch yuan oil benchmarks. Time for US government to slash government spending and drastically raise interest rates! Going to happen? Probably not.

1741 2018-01-02 20:30:54 Just so you know. Hemp is hemp. Marijuana is a drug. 
Hemp can replace oil, fuel, plastic, concrete; can be made into clothing, lotions, and food (you eat the seeds, very healthy). Also, it only contains CBD the NON-psychoactive constituent - not a drug.

1742 2018-01-02 20:30:53 To a degree but the issue with the Kings was no Quick and the players had tired of Sutter. We tend to forget the Kings are doing what they are doing and have been w/out Carter much of the season.

1756 2018-01-02 20:29:45 My oldest daughter, aka my cutiepie, came into my work for her oil change and bought me a steak burrito from Chipotle. So good.
1757 2018-01-02 20:29:41 (to scare the Scottish people from aspiring to live in a wealthy, socially equitable, just, and inclusive Scotland), light years away from the bankers and financiers capitalist greed in London. Scotland has a massive bargaining chip with this vast oil and gas wealth.
1758 2018-01-02 20:29:29 literally `floating` on oil and gas resources. It is NOT Scotland that has the problem with economic survival as an independent country. Any person who argues otherwise is either ignoring reality and the facts before them, or they are dealing in lies, deceit and conspiracy
1759 2018-01-02 20:29:21 Haha
1760 2018-01-02 20:29:11 underground in one Scottish mainland well alone). Added to these supermassive oil and gas revenues would be the tax income one would expect from a normal, wealthy, sovereign nation (income tax, VAT, corporation tax, PRT, etc., etc.). Scotland is an EXTTREMELY WEALTHY COUNTRY,
1761 2018-01-02 20:28:59 @MountainDew why come u got vegetable oil in your drink
1762 2018-01-02 20:28:57 on the oil and gas reserves from the Scottish estuaries (Firths) and Scottish onshore (mainland) oil and gas reserves (over75 million tonnes of crude oil have already been extracted from under mainland Scotland with over 35 million tonnes of crude oil still remaining in place

1764 2018-01-02 20:28:39 I am sure we will find out at some later date that he has interests in mining or oil companies.
1765 2018-01-02 20:28:33 There are enough Scottish oil and gas reserves remaining, actually and potentially, to restructure the entire Scottish economy, create a Sovereign Oil Fund, and create a Scandinavian style society where the Scottish ``Common Weal`` is paramount. These estimates are before we add

1784 2018-01-02 20:26:33 Yes. London. BP P.L.C., formerly British Petroleum, is a British multinational oil and gas company headquartered in London. It is one of the world's 7 oil and gas "supermajors", whose performance in 2012 made it the world's 6th-largest oil and gas company.
1785 2018-01-02 20:26:29 Yeah he’s home now. Silly thing got the oil change he needed as well. Just wish he’d had his phone 
1786 2018-01-02 20:26:28 It's good to consume oils of the seeds which are naturally found in abundance in the region we live in
. So, it's groundnut, mustard and gingelly oil. Rice bran is just the left over part of the seed. Olive oil/ canola is a no no
1787 2018-01-02 20:26:14 Trump puts himself first. No one else. His tax plan favours billionaires, but that's your loss, not mine. His policies favour big oil at the expense of the climate. His foreign policy is causing havoc in the Middle East. How did the 1st black president set you back racially???
1788 2018-01-02 20:26:02 This better be the best damn oil change I ever had

1805 2018-01-02 20:24:07 Looked at from this perspective, the Scottish oil and gas industry is far from ``declining``, and in fact, the opposite is very much the case. The most optimistic cumulative oil and gas forecast (all Scottish oil and gas provinces) for Scottish oil an gas revenues is £4 TRILLION
1806 2018-01-02 20:23:59 add oil! like babyoil or some kind of solution of the same consistency

The smooth ride of LightRail has spoiled me.

1827 2018-01-02 20:22:02 DISGUSTING DECISION MAKING ~ 27 MILLION IS NOT TO HELP PEOPLE OF NEWFOUNDLAND OR LABRADOR BUT  OIL COMPANIES TO HAVE HIGH SPEED CONNECTIONS TO THE WORLD! PEOPLE OF NEWFOUNDLAND ARE BEING USED!  CHECK OUT REMOTE COMMUNITIES  sure they need HIGH SPEED~ OUTRAGEOUS! OIL COMPANIES!
1828 2018-01-02 20:22:00 The only thing that happened with oil was previous agreements were broken. Of course, it pissed folks off. British-built Abadan oil refinery
1829 2018-01-02 20:21:52 You should. And eat it with palm oil, salt, plenty pepper and other condiments and orishirishi
1830 2018-01-02 20:21:52 Só não vale, aumentar o preço.

1833 2018-01-02 20:21:38 Sweat finely sliced onion/garlic, add fresh tomatoes, cook slowly, season then mix with basil, spag & best olive oil. Simple but delicious. Great with N Italian white
1834 2018-01-02 20:21:32 ยังมีอะไรให้กุคิดอีกหรอเนี่ย
1835 2018-01-02 20:21:27 So everybody gotta get an oil change today 
1836 2018-01-02 20:21:23 1/  It was just an example of how new technology replaces "old" technology or business technology. Many Americans made fortunes in the whaling business until electricity became available and replaced whale oil. All the whaling industry jobs died in a few short years. I wasn't

1843 2018-01-02 20:20:22 The difference being, Oilers haven't dealt with any serious in-season injuries to key pieces or received the level of goaltending Jets got for the last numbers of years.

1845 2018-01-02 20:20:09 Bradford was telling me how too much product on your skin, especially true before bed time is not good as your skin produces it's own healing oil. Tonight's the first night that I'm not drowning myself in essential oils. Let's see how this goes

1847 2018-01-02 20:19:51 My 7 started outputting sound at half volume, and I thought one of the speakers was broken. I took it to Apple, and it turns out one of them was physically blocked by dirt and oil that just needed to be cleaned out
1848 2018-01-02 20:19:42 Remembered enough of my 37 year old @USNavy Electrician's Mate training to fix the oil fired boiler that heats my home.  Problem was a loose wire to the flame sensor.  Navy training is good for a lifetime

1852 2018-01-02 20:19:28 True, true. I've tried that as well, but my eyelids get really sensitive with too many removals. Even if I use an oil and soft cloth. Just rubbing them too much and they start to burn/sting/pain. :(
1853 2018-01-02 20:19:16 I used to play pranks in college so I get the humor. But I never went beyond milk put into a vent or tuna fish oil on the walls of floor mate’s room.

1856 2018-01-02 20:18:45 It depends on the scale I guess. I spent four years filtering sales pitches for projects over 1M$ between a company and consultants in a field the client didn't understand. At least 50% had to be without remorse because I could prove to them they were selling snake oil

1858 2018-01-02 20:18:38 Finally breaking the chains of oil! How much time we have lost of progressing in mass transportation because oil needed one car per person to get top profit!

1860 2018-01-02 20:18:36 Oil leases are only valuable because of the use of oil - if we ceased using oil because cold fusion was available then oil leases would cease to value
1861 2018-01-02 20:18:22 Naturally gas prices are higher.  There is a Republican in the whe HOUSE.  Let's do away with the tax subsidies to BIG oil.
1862 2018-01-02 20:18:17 27 MILLION? PREMIER BALL AND SEAMUS ARE MAKING HIGH SPEED  DECISIONS NOT FOR THE PEOPLE IN RURAL ST'JOHNS'S BUT FOR OIL COMPANIES! WHERE PART OF DOLLARS COMMING FROM.   People  in rural towns don't have houses to live in ~ HIGH SPEED TO CONNECT OIL TO THE WORLD? OIL OIL! OIL!!!
1863 2018-01-02 20:18:05 Who cares now 12 years later. No credit bubble in Canada not US, and far far lower oil prices AND lower taxes in US
1864 2018-01-02 20:18:02 its all cos of oil money!
1865 2018-01-02 20:17:45 I would still have to buy and peel fresh ginger and fresh lime juice or the plastic Realime Juice which is hard to find. Sesame Oil is for flavour not for oil, but I hate its flavour. Unlikely to make this, have to be honest.

1873 2018-01-02 20:16:57 Once those free oil changes from the dealership are uses up...it is freakin' EXPENSIVE to get your v8 Chevy done!!
1874 2018-01-02 20:16:55 Correct.  And Russia & China need SA to end the USD's oil monopoly as a matter of Chinese & Russian national security.  Both will go the way of the USSR if USD oil monopoly is not ended ASAP.  SA is caught b/t a rock & a hard place.  They will have to acquiesce to China & Russia.
1875 2018-01-02 20:16:50 See. That’s a truthful statement. Modest. Right-sized to the data. It’s absolutely the case. I couldn’t agree more. But a fiat announcement about how the SA is going to value oil at x barrels to the ounce. Hmmm. Anyway. We’ve both got things to do. I love your brain. Cheers.
1876 2018-01-02 20:16:44 Can’t wait to have my own house so I can hang oil paintings everywhere and use a decanter for my whisky without being scared that it’ll get broken
1877 2018-01-02 20:16:43 is every single person in the district trying to get an oil change today? signs point to yes, meaning jiffy lube has a resolution quotient right up there with the gym.

1882 2018-01-02 20:16:03 This is the gigantic stupid.  I cannot believe that HR McMaster just uttered such stupidity.  China does not care who Pakistan does or does not support so long as it keeps India down on it's border and let's them protect China new Belt Road and Oil pipelines.

1889 2018-01-02 20:15:34 I hate getting an oil change cause it’s never just an oil change. It’s an oil change and the replacement of like five parts for which “it’s about time to change”.

1891 2018-01-02 20:15:21 Kind of like oil and coal companies paying zero for the "hidden" massive air pollution from their products, the super-rich don't pay enough for the "hidden" benefits they derive from our society.  @AnandWrites

1896 2018-01-02 20:14:47 Here’s a fun fact that everyone should know: I’ve been cut by every WHL team in Alberta except Edmonton. So if anyone is connected to the oil kings throw in a word for me. All I need is a shirt and for them to tell me I’m too slow. Then I’ll be on my way.

1939 2018-01-02 20:10:20 they need to create better climate from the damage, fix the damage of the oil extraction and create community foods and medicine gardens.
1940 2018-01-02 20:10:19 Scalp, not all your hair. With conditioner apply it all over your hair and not on your scalp. It’ll clog your pores if you apply it to your scalp & limit hair growth. Also do Black castor oil & coconut oil at night time, wash out in morning. Invest in a bonnet & co wash product
1941 2018-01-02 20:10:16 There are a lot of bad regimes. What could be the obsession with Iran? It's the only one he cares about. Does he want a war to steal oil maybe? So hypocritical to obsess over them when he's a wannabe dictator who loves dictators.

1954 2018-01-02 20:08:27 “Click the link to see the snake oil I’m selling you. The same oil I never personally used”.
1955 2018-01-02 20:08:15 @oilfractals @Oil_Tradr Not as exciting of a day today of me battling managed money funded trolls. But I did spar with an apologist of white colonialism just now. As usual, when presented with an argument, they only resort to name calling and blocking. His name was @mlgyoffice.
1956 2018-01-02 20:08:11 I bought #Bitcoin, #Litecoin #ethereum #Verge #Silver a #Bigmac, home heating oil, checker burgers, Which one will be worth the most.
1957 2018-01-02 20:07:45 Oh we have PLENTY of that in Canada. You don't know from remote till you've been in the backwoods of Canada. As a hippie kid, I spent a lot of time miles past all roads, in shacks made of driftwood. No electricity, no plumbing, oil barrels as wood stoves...

1959 2018-01-02 20:07:23 that moment in Bojack Horseman Season 3 where they discuss the myth of adding olive oil to pasta to stop it sticking has got to be one of my favourite tv moments of all time #futility #BoJackHorseman
1960 2018-01-02 20:07:13 Bcash is a highly centralized fork of a decentralized cryptocurrency that is slowly being treated by CME,  Cboe and Nasdaq (in June) like oil. This is not even a competition. Bcash and #bitcoin are playing a different sport.
1961 2018-01-02 20:07:08 Gotta credit Apple for turning a defect into making people think it's OK to pay for it like it's an oil change for your phone.
1962 2018-01-02 20:07:06 Bio Oil actually works!
1963 2018-01-02 20:07:05 My oil change is always around $50 and today I got it $20.86 
1964 2018-01-02 20:06:50 So by your logic the pharmaceutical industry has to be a snake oil salesman as well because they make a profit from giving people drugs that only suppress symptoms and keep the patient sick.

I haven't heard anything about #Trump 's reaction to the ship supply oil to N. Korea coming from Russia and not China.

Or is his tweets about Iran & Pakistan meant to divert attention?

1971 2018-01-02 20:06:20 Can someone smarter than me explain why we’re so concerned w Iran all of a sudden? What about other oppressive regimes around the world? Something to do w the oil? Why aren’t more focused on helping Puerto Rico?

1974 2018-01-02 20:06:07 That's unfortunate. I'm quite interested in the structure of peat and how it is largely ignored as important for peatland reclamation. I'm just finishing an MSc on peat applications to a constructed peatland in the oil sands; I look forward to following your work on macropores!

2090 2018-01-02 19:50:56 for my birthday I want an oil change and slightly less miserable weather
2091 2018-01-02 19:50:55 Many thing happened today to BTS and army 
You know thé saying "when there is a fire dont pure oïl on it let it calm alone and first and then say what u have to say "
Because everything happening now it's ARMY and BTS fault please FAM dont reply to their bash juste move on

2094 2018-01-02 19:50:34 Global Warming Vs the Oncoming Ice Age

Okay, there is global warming, period. I no longer argue with Flat Earthers, Warming Deniers, or Children who Believe in the Tooth Fairy. If you don't know the Arctic is melting, even the oil companies that brainwash the stupid

2100 2018-01-02 19:50:14 We dont. Israel says it is and it's government is there.
2101 2018-01-02 19:49:51 Netflix and Samsung do not mix - it's like oil and water - loada shite! Now having to watch Netflix via my pc - no more samsung ever!
2102 2018-01-02 19:49:46 The wind carries the scent of exertion; the faint sounds of limbs in motion, of wheels spinning, a beast leashed by chain and tooth. A hint of oil, grease, rubber. Behind the light, eyes that reflect and flicker, low and high.
2103 2018-01-02 19:49:46 Eto ha. What if. You only live with people you love and trust. That would be really nice.
2104 2018-01-02 19:49:42 Very few people here in NEBC still use oil for heating. Very few.
2105 2018-01-02 19:49:41 If that's the case, what are you doing about China and Russia giving oil to NK in violation of the UN sanctions?  If nothing, then shut up!
2106 2018-01-02 19:49:39 @realDonaldTrump Trumpo When they do fight in the Middle East hopefully You got plans were oil’s going to come from Alaska would be my Bet
2107 2018-01-02 19:49:26 Bollocks! Perhaps your new law will inspire better customer service at full service stations. My guy checks all fluid levels and tops off water for free, washer fluid for a small fee, and oil by the quart; adds air to tires if needed.
2108 2018-01-02 19:49:19 mango lime castor oil is my absolute favorite.
2109 2018-01-02 19:49:15 We have murdered 0.5m Syrians  cause we wanted their oil?  Is that better or worse?
2110 2018-01-02 19:49:12 I started a YouTube channel “Hella Baked” to teach people how to cook food using medicinal butter/oil. Wondering which vid to drop first:

2113 2018-01-02 19:48:53 Probably smoking that brick weed that stinks the house up for days. He needs to be introduced to some wax or oil. Smell doesnt linger lmao
2114 2018-01-02 19:48:53 If this weather is making your skin super dry then put coconut oil (or a body oil of your choice) on while you’re still wet in the shower and dont rinse it off
2115 2018-01-02 19:48:50 Nope, they've got fluoride-free toothpaste. Or don't use toothpaste at all - look up "oil pulling"!
2116 2018-01-02 19:48:47 if you oil regularly you'll need to trim less often, that'll allow the hair to compensate. but that's just my theory 
2117 2018-01-02 19:48:41 Anyone interested in asking where are the bullying and tough words following Russian transport of oil to NK ?

2121 2018-01-02 19:48:05 Little argument from me on this point.  We do need strong policy to ensure that oil demand goes down year over year.
2122 2018-01-02 19:47:59 can someone pls bring me some A&D ointment or coconut oil? :(
2123 2018-01-02 19:47:57 Fuck xans 2018 we out here popping fish oil
2124 2018-01-02 19:47:50 Im going to try their cbd oil this week
2125 2018-01-02 19:47:21 On what basis do you say that the oil industry spends $1bn a year on climate misinformation?
2126 2018-01-02 19:47:16 I could tell my housemate was playing Oil Ocean by the swears #SonicMania
2127 2018-01-02 19:47:15 Good candidate for a full pardon.
2128 2018-01-02 19:47:13 Or maybe I should just carry some oil when it gets close to 0? At least I'm sure it was the cables causing issues.
2129 2018-01-02 19:47:05 Spent the afternoon cleaning the truck. Gave it its first oil change. Now time to go out and get it dirty again.
2130 2018-01-02 19:46:27 I need an oil change , but I don’t want to go out
2131 2018-01-02 19:46:27 Lmao just some light oil on my body!! Chill Mr. Photographer ! I got you!
2132 2018-01-02 19:46:20 It has nothing to do with FG and all about international oil prices.
2133 2018-01-02 19:46:20 BUT the coconut oil..the vitamin e oil will be my substitute. Try the retinA and let me know how it goes baby.
2134 2018-01-02 19:46:11 idk what the best part about nye was the music or the fact that angel pulls out a fuck ton of oil infusers from his pocket not knowing where he got them from 
2135 2018-01-02 19:46:02 and by the way it was the EF-111 Raven variants for electronic warfare , and were obviously escorting something above top secret , this was out in the middle of the north sea when we were on the oil rig , a buddy shouted me out to come and see and that whats i saw
2136 2018-01-02 19:45:50 there is an art to oil frying and I'm determined to master it
2137 2018-01-02 19:45:49 #WesternMedia is talking about #AfricanMigrants and how they were treated in #Libya.No one talks about how to tackle the #smugglers and the #corrupt leaders of these #African countries who are supported by the #WesternWorld for #oil and #minerals without #accountability.
2138 2018-01-02 19:45:48 This is preposterous! This fuel scarcity started 1st week in December 2017, the Buhari government had to wait till 2nd of January 2018 before deciding to  summon stakeholders in the oil sector to Abuja?! OMG! Nigerians don't have a government 
2139 2018-01-02 19:45:37 That's good that oil is increasing in price not for the OPEC coffers but maybe the price hike is an incentive towards more renewable energy
2140 2018-01-02 19:45:27 Sounds like me with the Calabrian chili olive oil.
2141 2018-01-02 19:45:24 MY VIEW ! if our GOVT would STOP giving so much MONEY to OIL RICH countries  to help their ppl  this  country would have MONEY to help  OUR  HURTING PPL   for once enough is enough  !
2142 2018-01-02 19:45:16 Same to you! You guys helped me out one time, actually. Annie Cat licked some essential oil she wasn’t supposed to have and I called, freaking out. Thankfully, she was just fine and I appreciated the kind advice from RR.
2143 2018-01-02 19:45:04 Commodities and Gold moving may signal interest rates about to make a significant move up.  Let's see....   $GLD $OIL $NOG $MUX
2144 2018-01-02 19:44:56 Wait what? the moisturizer is a barrier , the oil should go first & then top it with a moisturizer to seal all the goodies 
2145 2018-01-02 19:44:49 Oof, gave my parents $300 for Christmas and furnace oil. They're paying for my dental so it works. Then I put 250 towards my credit card and bought a quality jacket off my boss for 150. Good things I've got a $1200 pay coming
2146 2018-01-02 19:44:46 make some! all u need is a vegan onion and vegan oil and vegan heat! (no whale oil lamps!)
2147 2018-01-02 19:44:45 I disagree - you have to do something with oil to make it worth having - its value is latent as well unless you refine it, combust it or process it
2148 2018-01-02 19:44:44 Getting an oil change in the winter sucks. The building is too cold for this
2149 2018-01-02 19:44:43 Dude, you do realize that each of the three people you mentioned stand to make an individual profit from their "research". They are what we call snake oil salesmen. Ugh, you know what, just do your own experiment if you want to know anything about immunopathology. Have a nice day
2150 2018-01-02 19:44:35 He did, they didnt wanted him to complete his 2nd term in office. Watergate and his obstruction was fabricated and a nothing burger. The deep state wanted him out because Nixon ended their opium trade. Vietnam was a replacement to lost Cuba to Castro. US runs on oil & opium

Let's snuggle in a new car. xo
2157 2018-01-02 19:44:04 Not entirely - the economy is also suffering due to years of mismanagement by the Iranian regime and by relatively low oil prices.
2158 2018-01-02 19:43:58 ...Rising oil prices... The Dog Whistle of Donald Trump, President of the United States.
2159 2018-01-02 19:43:34 The trump/tillerson/Exxon Mobil complex survives through middle Eastern unrest. Driving oil prices up with private contracts with Russian Oil. That's it. Oil, money, privatization, the GOP.
2160 2018-01-02 19:43:17 Agree on TIPs based breakeven, but the latter has a "risk premium" component and oil prices component.

2162 2018-01-02 19:43:13 waiting @ jiffy lube for an oil change and they definitely just pulled three cars into the bay ahead of me that were all here after me. What even is customer service
2163 2018-01-02 19:43:10 My balance is okay, I just struggle to hear people. It's like 75% of my hearing is gone mate. I'm dripping olive oil in my ears every day because it's supposed to help, but I think I have to see my GP. Got an appointment anyway on the 17th so I hope it's fixed by then.
2164 2018-01-02 19:43:10 In my hometown, I get consults about rashes while I get my oil changed.
2165 2018-01-02 19:43:06 Mahn I hate bleaching oil.. only thing worth the stress to me is ayamase.. but when I get my kitchen I’ll sha try it

2167 2018-01-02 19:43:01 I used to put lavender oil on Aubrey’s lil feet every night. She’d be SCHLEEP lol all night
2168 2018-01-02 19:42:56 Because there are far more coal power plants then there are wind farms. My main concern is rationality. oil coal wind solar Geothermal hydroelectric and even tidal power all have a role to play.
2169 2018-01-02 19:42:50 i get so annoyed when i’m trying to get my oil changed and they want to sell me a bunch of unnecessary stuff bc they think i’m STUPID
2170 2018-01-02 19:42:38 Getting off of oil is a no brainer. The interesting question I think is if people in Northeast still using oil are better off switching to gas or leap-frogging to electric?
2171 2018-01-02 19:42:35 @LauraMercier what’s the deal with your oil free tinted moisturiser? It’s out of stock everywhere in the UK - please tell me it’s not discontinued?

Oil where , you planning something idk 
2179 2018-01-02 19:41:40 They shd leave the business for those with the financial muscle to do it. Na by force to do oil business? Every motorist now knos how to queue for 2/3 days to get 10litres. So make una pack one side.
2180 2018-01-02 19:41:27 I wonder the same thing about the people who believe Tony Seba. Maybe it’s time for another oil price-style long-run bet?
2181 2018-01-02 19:41:13 Big agenda for big oil. Not human rights. Never human rights.
2182 2018-01-02 19:41:10 Cabbage,olive oil, lemon, and a lil pepper!!!!! So so so so yummy! #GoVegan #LoveYourself #swearbythis #amazingveggies
2183 2018-01-02 19:41:05 Also, those are big numbers. But to make an argument you have to put them in context against the alternative necessary mining of coal, gas and oil. Or safe sequestration of radioactive waste.
2184 2018-01-02 19:41:01 Except how your buddy putler is still selling them oil.   And unrelated news, today I saved a bunch of money by switching to Geico #TrumpTakesCredit @realDonaldTrump

2188 2018-01-02 19:40:38 I can have someone pump my gas if I so choose. It's called Full Service. They check oil, tire pressure, and wash windows while pumping.

Do Oregonians think full service will be outlawed?
2189 2018-01-02 19:40:33 ports would probably require considerable upgrading and expansion to deal with the vessel traffic volumes necessary to service the oil and gas rigs in the Scottish Atlantic Margin. The port at Oban is one possibility, the Clyde another, while expansion has already taken place at
2190 2018-01-02 19:40:29 Since everyone got a diffuser this year how about we share our essential oil mixes I’m trying to get relaxed and calmed
2191 2018-01-02 19:40:22 この前炎龍堂に寄ったらテオさんがお茶出してくれて美味かったぜ～なんかモミアゲ長いねーちゃんがちょっと睨んでたけど(笑)
2192 2018-01-02 19:40:17 One only has to look at the success of Aberdeen airport in servicing the oil and gas rigs in the Scottish North Sea. There are various sea ports along the west coast of Scotland which could be used by vessels servicing the Atlantic rigs, west of Scotland. 
The Scottish west coast
2193 2018-01-02 19:40:17 You mean like buying terrorist Saudi oil the USA? That then bombs the towers etc.? Hypocricy. Trump family business there, look it up the connections.
2194 2018-01-02 19:40:14 And the destruction of two incredible National Monuments in his home state, opening up the sacred ground of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase to mineral extraction-a gift to his oil and gas donors. His name will be cursed by future generations.
2195 2018-01-02 19:40:11 Yes but demand will only go away if we force it to. Absent policy, oil’s low price will keep us burning it for many years to come.
2196 2018-01-02 19:40:10 If you think this is for Iranians I'm scared for your logic. This is for Trump/Tillerson, Exxon Mobil, and their private agreements with Russia for oil prices. That's it. Reminder this is the same anti-muslim president keeping them there in the first place 
2197 2018-01-02 19:40:10 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
2198 2018-01-02 19:40:03 WOW, great work! Now how about you get strict on Forest Fires, Gun Control and Oil Spills, oh and Tax evasion too.
2199 2018-01-02 19:39:53 What Happened to the Oil Crisis?
2200 2018-01-02 19:39:26 Let me get this straight. You have the world's largest oil reserves (a collapsed economy) and now you want our oil too?
2201 2018-01-02 19:39:25 They can't catch me, I apply a thin but meaningful layer of oil to my body every morning
2202 2018-01-02 19:39:23 Oil is mightier than bombs. 
Riyadh can sustain $10/bbl oil far longer than Qom.
2203 2018-01-02 19:39:19 Meanwhile, the people of the United States of America, are crying out for the rights and the freedoms that are being systematically taken away by the Trump Administration.  Stand for our cause and stop trying to go to war with EVERYBODY for their oil.
2204 2018-01-02 19:39:15 @realDonaldTrump Worldwide total number of atomic tests is approximately 2000 which far excedes the 100 cubic miles of oil used in history. Is atomic testing a factor in global warming. Oil looks very minor compared to forrest fies & volcanoes. Where's the beef ?
2205 2018-01-02 19:39:08 I think we’re far more likely to reach peak car, when our streets are utterly siezed by gridlock. I don’t think we’ll ever reach peak oil.
2206 2018-01-02 19:38:55 Tea tree oil 
2207 2018-01-02 19:38:45 See similar study for Maine (not all increased use). There are real savings for households who previously used window AC, and households claim a whole list of benefits for switching from oil. Really matters what hh are switching from
2208 2018-01-02 19:38:41 Our tech squad's burning the midnight oil to get biz accts switched on to the Capital One app - no firm ETA, though. Best bet is to use the website for now. ^AJS
2209 2018-01-02 19:38:20 I'm sure there are sex parties in Houston oil biz too. But this story is silly. A disproportionate number of SV execs I know barely know how to talk to women. Plus, the marriage/divorce data in SV shows it's one of the most monogamous regions in US.
2210 2018-01-02 19:38:09 he's funny but can't get over his racist sh-t,
2211 2018-01-02 19:38:04 Oil change this week
2212 2018-01-02 19:38:03 The sentiment is easy.Trump is accused of being racist white nationalist who only likes Irani brown people b/c of oil. Terrible accusation & FALSE. POTUS supporting Irani people's revolt, that has nothing to do with oil. POTUS is NOT a racist & NOT alt-right.
2213 2018-01-02 19:38:03 I bought some tea tree oil for my piercing & I put a DROP on it . The smell is SO strong y’all it’s ridiculous.
2214 2018-01-02 19:37:35 The rig gets fed strictly oil
2215 2018-01-02 19:37:32 me too! what started this thread was 'oil wars are bad' which i can't possibly get more behind

i'm being a little ticky-tacky with the specifics here but ultimately i think we agree on much more things than we disagree on

2220 2018-01-02 19:36:59 Your myopic view shows your understanding. Crude oil is the only product sells at a particular price yet you still don't determine the price despite being a producer. So if that instance is too much for you to digest.
2221 2018-01-02 19:36:56 How could N Korea accept being starved & submited to sanctions that reduce the import of oil affecting transport & heating in harsh winter time & medical supplies scarce causing illness & deaths

2233 2018-01-02 19:36:01 45 gets it. VZLA is on the precipice of failed state status.. Russia and China have both moved in (the former by direct state loans secured by energy assets in , the latter via direct physical oil purchases over multi years). The failure and the dividend we will receive due..
2234 2018-01-02 19:35:28 Shoutout to coconut oil one time 
2235 2018-01-02 19:35:27 O am against the drilling of pipelines and drilling. The Exxon of the 90s never recovered The Gulf will take decades not counting all other numerous oil spills there have been
2236 2018-01-02 19:35:23 I cook my rice in vegetable stock, never plain water. And I make mexican rice so if you lightly toast with oil the rice BEFORE boiling it, it brings out a nice flavor. Add tomatos, green pepper and onion when it cooks, some cumin, garlic, salt pepper
2237 2018-01-02 19:35:22 I am ok with the oil to help seizure patients.   That’s about it.  It’s called the “gateway drug” for a reason and it’s much more potent than in the 80s and 90s.  Kills brain cells at a rapid rate. It will not stop the black market either.  Bad idea.
2238 2018-01-02 19:35:06 Ever try macadamia oil as a #HairTreatment? It is supposed to be great for healing and strengthening hair. It also acts as a natural SPF 6  #MacadamiaOil #HairCare
2239 2018-01-02 19:35:02 Nah they don’t ha ha. But coconut oil helps get a nice tan .. and a quick trip to the Drs for skin cancer ha ha
2240 2018-01-02 19:34:58 i was using an oil blotting sheet on my nose and forgot about my piercing andOHHH GODDD dkd it hurt so bad
2241 2018-01-02 19:34:43 la pasta es integral y tiene light alfredo sauce + mantequilla y ajo, el dressing es de guacamole ranch y el beefsteak de pollo fue hecho con organic coconut oil 
2242 2018-01-02 19:34:41 i've had my oil diffuser on almost all day and i just realized i never even put any essential oils in with the water jfalsjgaig
2243 2018-01-02 19:34:40 I was waiting for it nha I'll buy a machine I will cut bae a Brazilian chiskop this looks simple..all I need is cooking oil ,spirit n brush
2244 2018-01-02 19:34:22 Todays adventure consisted of going to an olive garden farm and tasting/learning about the process of making and buying good authentic olive oil 
2245 2018-01-02 19:34:10 Don’t forget the vitamin e oil for that scar!
2246 2018-01-02 19:33:59 Lavished my luscious locks with #CoconutOil before heading out for work this morning - and it was so cold, the oil froze on my hair. Thank God it wasn't #JheriCurlJuice: the thawing out would have been ugly...
2247 2018-01-02 19:33:56 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
2248 2018-01-02 19:33:44 Lol must not have oil or gas near it!
2249 2018-01-02 19:33:28 yh np! i cut it up, pressed out all the water, tossed it in some olive oil and soy sauce, sprinkled it with a tablespoon of cornstarch then tossed again, then baked at 400° for about 25 minutes. then i drenched it in more soy sauce when i had it w rice but i like salt too much so
2250 2018-01-02 19:33:27 Can US #NaturalGas prices be high enough to incentivize ongoing #shale #drilling while remaining low enough to be sustainably competitive on a global basis for #LNG exports in the long run?

2251 2018-01-02 19:33:25 What's another thing you do when everyone is out of the house including pets you ask?
Why you oil the wood floors with olive oil of course..
Duh
2252 2018-01-02 19:33:23 Just the Tesco free from mature cheddar with the coconut oil alternative. Super tasty!
2253 2018-01-02 19:33:23 Ma, ur mcm just copped a new louis v belt. He's $30 over his data AND still hasnt paid his mom back for buying him kurt shades with her credit card. His 2001 ford escort is 4000km over for an oil change...
2254 2018-01-02 19:33:10 Tons in our yard as they like black oil sunflower seed.  Our feeder is close to shelter from birds of prey. Yesterday a sparrow hawk got one though. I thought sparrow hawks went south for the winter?
2255 2018-01-02 19:32:57 Ready oil pump hnd blade..
2256 2018-01-02 19:32:38 Try the @AntipodesNZ divine facial oil Hun. All natural. My skin is sensitive and dehydrated and I love it x
2257 2018-01-02 19:32:23 "And/Or"??? Your cookies are "just like Grandma baked." Did Grandma not know what kind of oil she was using? What else didn't Grandma know about what she put in your food?
2258 2018-01-02 19:32:21 I’m in .
2259 2018-01-02 19:32:14 He's a moderate Democrat, and he's not popular with Cons. That's one reason he lost
2260 2018-01-02 19:32:12 oil paint smells sweet when it's dried
2261 2018-01-02 19:32:09 See there’s a conman snake oil salesmen who became president of the United States ANYTHING IS FREAKIN POSSIBLE
2262 2018-01-02 19:32:05 I haven't seen a tweet about Russia getting oil to NK. And by the way did you apply the Russian sanctions congress made and you signed?  Nope can't make Big Daddy Putin mad.
2263 2018-01-02 19:31:57 lmao as per bleached palm oil right? Or?
2264 2018-01-02 19:31:57 You realize that the reason for the price difference is largely due to taxes? The provinces and Feds are equally responsible. The treaty currently in place requires Canadian oil to be sold at the international price.
2265 2018-01-02 19:31:52 U.S. crude #oil futures settle at $60.37. 0.05. -0.08%. #CME #NYMEX #CL_G7 #OOTT

2266 2018-01-02 19:31:51 I should add I was asking because I have scarring issues etc and it's because of a mild genetic disorder- certain things can make it lots better like rosehip oil based stuff for your face. 
2267 2018-01-02 19:31:48 Getting my first oil change 
2268 2018-01-02 19:31:35 A completely unregulated market, where price patterns have all the hallmarks of stock crashes and 'crypto experts' are selling people an unhealthy dose of snake oil. What could possibly go wrong? #cryptocurrency
2269 2018-01-02 19:31:25 *clears throat*
-Monapax against coughing (1 tablespoone every morning and evening)
-Engystol for the immune system 
-3 drops of thyme oil in a small bowl of hot water to cleanse the air and free the nose
-stay hydrated
2270 2018-01-02 19:31:25 Coconut oil is under appreciated
2271 2018-01-02 19:31:22 My son was hitting the oil pen wit me and my cousin yesterday
2272 2018-01-02 19:31:18 Granny going get my oil changed for me 
2273 2018-01-02 19:31:12 Is spending £72 on a body oil a step too far in the January blues spending spree???
2274 2018-01-02 19:31:11 The last tweet on the thread
2275 2018-01-02 19:30:46 Mix 9 tsps Black Beans with 3 cups hummus. Mix into  Olive Oil. Allow to harden Serve on salad
2276 2018-01-02 19:30:43 lol I keep telling people use black castor oil for their beards. The people who listened beards out here flourishing.
2277 2018-01-02 19:30:38 interesting, i hear emissions regulations may prevent some oil fired plants from producing electricity.
2278 2018-01-02 19:30:28 OIL DIFF: 6.5 -> 6.57

2281 2018-01-02 19:30:19 In a few hours, once again, a cold winter’s night will descend upon the eastern US. 

And once again, a million left-wing, ‘BIG OIL!”-hating wackadoodles will not freeze to death, thanks solely to fossil fuels—with a special ‘Thank You’ owed to fracking. Now say your ‘Thank You’.
2282 2018-01-02 19:30:13 North Sea oil. Homogeneous societies, very few minorities. 
Small population. 

Also, the reverse is true here, with the added aspect of radically increasing socialist policies in America, taxes & regulations stifling economic growth.
2283 2018-01-02 19:30:06 Also, jojoba oil (available at e.g. Trader Joe's) is reportedly closest to your skin's natural oil. It saves my cuticles every winter. Might be worth trying on your face?
2284 2018-01-02 19:29:51 Can't get any further from reality than this.
2285 2018-01-02 19:29:47 No, you don't.  Nigeria has gas and oil and Trump wants it. Best you make peace with your maker and prepare for more boodshed
2286 2018-01-02 19:29:44 I use weed oil on daily basis. There's nothing wrong with that and you can buy it in every drug store here. It's not dangerous at all. Any beer does more harm.
2287 2018-01-02 19:29:35 Shampoo/conditioner labels:

Women: luscious lavender with a hint of sandlewood. Leaves you feeling silky and smooth...

Men: 78 in 1 . SHAMPOO, CONDITIONER, TOOTHPASTE, HAIR GEL, BODY WASH, DEODORANT, HAIR GEL, FACE SCRUB, DEGREASER, ENGINE OIL, WHEEL BEARING LUBE ALL IN ONE.
2288 2018-01-02 19:29:07 love when it’s cold & my knees match the color of the snow no matter how much water i drink & lotion & body oil i use
2289 2018-01-02 19:28:57 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
2290 2018-01-02 19:28:53 It's a remnant of old timey gas attendants who would also wipe the windshield, check oil, etc. A few states banned self-service in order to prevent losing jobs. The new law is just for places with small populations in Oregon
2291 2018-01-02 19:28:51 She smells #Oil
2292 2018-01-02 19:28:46 What is the law when it comes to CBD oil? Do you need a medical marijuana card to use it?
2293 2018-01-02 19:28:45 Are you suggesting Iran has not sold oil for 40 years, or purely to the oil-rich nation that is the U.S.? Perhaps he is first to speak due to non-reliance?
2294 2018-01-02 19:28:42 Because he just got paid for selling Utah national monuments to oil and coal companies and the GOP tax scam he just helped pass. He got paid enough to retire Ridiculously rich.
2295 2018-01-02 19:28:38 Coconut oil really does work for scars
2296 2018-01-02 19:28:37 I’m buying GOLD & OIL what’s up  #forex #Investments

2299 2018-01-02 19:28:35 Thanks but pls answer my question
2300 2018-01-02 19:28:34 You want to be a dictator? 
Create a currency and use it to sell your oil instead of the dollar.

2301 2018-01-02 19:28:18 2018 Predictions: Electric cars, cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence are poised for leaps forward...And Data will be the new oil for the digital era. Companies to watch include among others; @facebook , @YouTube @Twitter @Tesla @Microsoft #Happy_2018
2302 2018-01-02 19:28:06 I'm in love !!!
2303 2018-01-02 19:27:58 
2304 2018-01-02 19:27:57 But seriously, Zhou said need neutral rsv asset needed in '09, World Bk (Zoellick) said in 2010 gold should be used as SDR ref pt once CNY was added, IMF wrote abt pricing gold & oil in SDR's in early 2011, & Rogoff said in '16 EM's should bid gold w/FX rsvs to end USD shortage.
2305 2018-01-02 19:27:55 The crude oil is the only product you sell at a particular price but you don't determine the price despite being a producer. So, if that comment above didn't simplify to be an instance for you, I think you need to check yourself.
2306 2018-01-02 19:27:54 The only real reason is that Scottish spending was boosted when oil was booming. Now that the boom has gone we have much higher levels of public spending per head without the extra revenue to fund it.
2307 2018-01-02 19:27:40 How does free unfettered, unregulated access to internet on government part figure into this? Stupid anology
2308 2018-01-02 19:27:05 .... by virtue of secured state loans against US assets, and the Chinese have pre paid multi years worth of physical oil flow. I mean underneath our doorstep, our two gr8 strategic rivals are positioning themselves to be an influence in this sphere going forward..... that amigo..

2311 2018-01-02 19:26:38 why don't u SOLARise all petrol pumps? give subsidy & monitor through oil Co officials. Besides saving power think of the advertisement considering d combined footfall n such outlets
2312 2018-01-02 19:26:27 まさの霊圧を感じた
2313 2018-01-02 19:26:25 On the day Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, BP officials had gathered on the platform to celebrate 7 years without injury or accident.
2314 2018-01-02 19:26:23 Wages are so far behind production that by the time demand drives up prices, we'll be doing quite well. 1970s saw social spending increase + Vietnam War with no tax increases + OPEC oil embargo which had huge knock on price multipliers. Was no simple case of "inflation."
2315 2018-01-02 19:26:02 Fue emergencia, cargue en una ypf que cargo siempre y me vendieron falopa. Me hizo 6 km x litro y tuve que reponer en la oil xq no podia volver.  Siempre cargo en esso o en la de juanjo.
2316 2018-01-02 19:26:00 In what way has he delivered? If by that he means making it easier for nursing homes to abuse the elderly downsizing the safety guideline for oil drilling then sure you would be right

2321 2018-01-02 19:25:14 @SarahGrahamFood absolutely love your new Wholesome cook book. Do you know where I can get truffle oil in jhb?
2322 2018-01-02 19:25:14 "the Department of the Interior issued a new interpretation of a law, essentially freeing companies of liability for accidentally killing birds in uncovered oil pits or by putting up unmarked power lines."  

"Accidentally" is next to impossible to prove.  Oh goodie indeed.
2323 2018-01-02 19:25:08 Hollywood won't & don't do anything unless it benefits from it.

For example, middle East oil. They have made films about it. But it was paid & sponsored for & by a middle East group

In the end. You have to make yourself louder
2324 2018-01-02 19:25:05 Cutting the corporate tax rate and encouraging oil drilling were standard GOP agenda items decades before Trump came along. 

When the GOP embraces the border wall and limiting immigration, then they will have embraced Trump's agenda.
2325 2018-01-02 19:24:58 Did you ever know someone living on Tesla Time up to 1943 NYE + 8 days ? Well I did. They knew about Chicago Detroit Gas Stations Big Oil companies Chrysler Corporation and Nikola Tesla 24/7 free energy collector beams using the Tesla bulb and iron energy if not mistaken

2327 2018-01-02 19:24:44 First attempt at cannabis tea. Kitchen smells like a marching band lol hope this shit works. 3 cups water, 2 tablespoons coconut oil and a few grams of flower. Will update later.
2328 2018-01-02 19:24:44 I need to get tea tree oil and aloe Vera plant right after work !
2329 2018-01-02 19:24:39 Tried a new hair oil sample today... my hair has never felt better... of course it’s $50 to actually buy it 
2330 2018-01-02 19:24:29 Fucking tragic. Gonna anoint my lottery ticket with holy oil. I need millions.
2331 2018-01-02 19:24:28 Silk tofu, salt, pepper, lemon and vinegar, any kind of vegetable oil. You can add later some herbs or taste. Thanks for the video.
2332 2018-01-02 19:24:26 glad i got up when i did cause i already gotta wait 45 minutes just to get an oil change 
2333 2018-01-02 19:24:08 Coconut oil is also tasty on toast - different to butter, of course, but good with both savoury and sweet things (mmm, top notch with raspberry jam, for example!) #Veganuary #Veganuary2018
2334 2018-01-02 19:23:57 So far, I'm clearly getting ready to bless the oil and heating employee bonuses for the end of 2018. My thermostat went from 68* "you know, I'll be fine." 72* "*defiant*..I know I work hard, I deserve this heat." To 74* "shiiiiiid, God's got me.".
2335 2018-01-02 19:23:43 Ecco cosa devo mettere sul brufolo...il tea tree oil!! Lo avevo rimosso
2336 2018-01-02 19:23:24 You just made me realize I’ve needed an oil change for like 2 months

2339 2018-01-02 19:23:03 I have the raw honey cleanser and the oil moisturizer... HOLY GRAIL  I wake up in the morning and my skin is glowing!
2340 2018-01-02 19:22:52 exfoliated my face and lips with brown sugar and coconut oil and i truly feeel unfuckwitable... shit is smoother than everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
2341 2018-01-02 19:22:44 Oily skin sisters. How do yoh treat this condition ? I could make a bottle of cooking oil from my face hle  HELP
2342 2018-01-02 19:22:38 Non-dairy spread with a little rock or sea salt sprinkled on would work. Or if you're feeling adventurous, you could try rubbing a clove or garlic on your toast, drizzling it with olive oil and sprinkling a little salt on.
2343 2018-01-02 19:22:23 Why would FSG spend their own money? That’s not really sensible business. There job is to grow our revenues so we can compete and that is starting to happen. Football clubs are big business even for oil rich individuals.

2346 2018-01-02 19:22:13 Or legalise cannabis oil.. kills cancer cells for free
2347 2018-01-02 19:22:11 Oh brother. They don't want your interference and I'm sure they don't want you taking their oil.
2348 2018-01-02 19:22:05 This oil change

2350 2018-01-02 19:21:45 Tallahassee Chevrolet wrecked our car and we only went in for a oil change
2351 2018-01-02 19:21:44 America supports freedom...y’all got oil right? Oil do anything for freedom oops we’ll do anything for freedom
2352 2018-01-02 19:21:37 Thank you lovely! I don’t use any heat on it when I usually wash it, and I put olive oil on it every few weeks to prevent it being dry, trust me that helps a lot
2353 2018-01-02 19:21:22 I still think my kale baked as chips in the oven with olive oil and goat cheese would work for you. Fish tacos should be pieces of fried spicy  fish with delicious veggies, salsa and guacamole! (Cheese is optional.)
2354 2018-01-02 19:21:16 Il tea tree oil è come il vetrix.
2355 2018-01-02 19:21:14 I'm not the one claiming asteroids contain oil, or oil not being a fossil fuel.
2356 2018-01-02 19:21:13 An oil painting fueled by cryptocurrency 2.
2357 2018-01-02 19:21:09 Here lies Ashwin, he was going to be a little bit more about the oil.

...ok
2358 2018-01-02 19:21:02 And you spoke a LOAD of shite? 
Sanctions are structured to have an economic impact & the sanctions in fact directly TARGETTED the Iranian oil industry - it's source of revenue! 

Misleading bullshit that I can't believe you got away with unchallenged.
2359 2018-01-02 19:20:42 Omg ! My Guchipoo is not well and hungry ! I feel bad. Someone is not doing the assingned duty well. But did he really put rice and dahi on oil ? Is this some new recipe I am not aware of or this is #VikasGupta special ?

2360 2018-01-02 19:20:27 in the words of sage @jake_lyktr, '2018 is all about the fucking oil diffusers'
2361 2018-01-02 19:20:23 Rig Count – Latest count shows no change from the previous week
for oil rigs, staying at 747 active rigs, up 222 form this time last year.  Natgas rig count dropped by 2 for a total of
182 active rigs, up 50 from a year ago.
2362 2018-01-02 19:20:18 Except the selling of pirated refined oil to NOKO on the high seas thingie.
2363 2018-01-02 19:20:02 Because of their greed for the iranian oil i guess
2364 2018-01-02 19:20:00 Putting castor oil on my eyebrows and lashes in 2018. About to look like a fucking deer!
2365 2018-01-02 19:19:52 Wow you can’t even do an oil change yourself. Smh. “Men” these days.
2366 2018-01-02 19:19:40 For  OIL, OIL, OIL
2367 2018-01-02 19:19:40 Why is olive oil $7???
2368 2018-01-02 19:19:30 If you believe your beloved Quebec isn’t buying tanker oil from Venezuela’s killer dictator & Arab women hating Sheiks you are a typical anti pipeline Quebecer. Taking Alberta oilequalization money from the Fed Govt with eyes closed. U need oil money
2369 2018-01-02 19:19:26 Glad it worked out. Just about the worst week to be without oil. Thanks for reminding me to check my tank and reorder!

2372 2018-01-02 19:18:56 I've only found 2 biscuits suitable for #Vegans and which don’t contain palm oil - McVitie’s Rich Tea and Digestive Light*. Nairn’s choc chip oat biscuits contain sustainable p/oil.  #veganhour
*Bought a pack today but I will not open it until I have to!
2373 2018-01-02 19:18:34 Started my Morning with essential oil and Palo Santo  
2374 2018-01-02 19:18:11 Today is the day I swap tires and add a tail light kit on my scooter, get my car's oil changed and tires rotated, and just get some things done in general!
2375 2018-01-02 19:17:55 Skin dehydrates quickly in winter with cold outside and dry heat inside. Change your skincare routine, buffer face #scrubs to be more gentle and use them less often, then follow with a nourishing oil. #skincaretip #winterskincare
2376 2018-01-02 19:17:51 Nobody tells you at 16 how expensive cars are with gas every week, oil changes, tire rotations, car insurance, and any repair on it. 
2377 2018-01-02 19:17:46 Where is your conscience? 
When you add oil to the fire? 
You think, people can’t see your dirty politics.
Please stop it! 
Don’t exploit the Dalits by your selfishness,
& Your dirty politics.
2378 2018-01-02 19:17:42 sticking your nose into places you have no say in again? Rights are rights of the nation that grants them not you snake oil salesmen.

2380 2018-01-02 19:16:45 Lil oil change 
2381 2018-01-02 19:16:41 Every product I put on my face is either oil free/control or matte, but somehow I still get oily

2383 2018-01-02 19:16:01 India's eight core sectors - coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement and electricity, together grew at 6.8% in November 2017, compared to 3.2% in Nov 2016.
India's industrial activity clearly showing an energetic rebound.
#PositiveIndia
2384 2018-01-02 19:15:57 Didn't know the whole population needed an oil change the same day as me
2385 2018-01-02 19:15:51 This is the call of war. The usa must get control of the oil in Iran. Wasn't these guys burning the usa flag not so long ago.
2386 2018-01-02 19:15:49 Oil is a dangerous pretty lady. You think you want it, but haven't really gotten into learning about it.
2387 2018-01-02 19:15:35 Missed my appoiny at the dealership had to get an oil change at a side shop $60?? TF?! See if i miss another appoint again
2388 2018-01-02 19:15:27 I had a dream I found the best oil colored pencils 
When I woke up I really thought I had bought them... 
stupid bitch
2389 2018-01-02 19:15:09 We have technology to replace oil, is a fact.  Prove we can't.
2390 2018-01-02 19:15:08 I see your point, but even oil "reserves" in the ground have value. I'm suspicious of attaching to much value to data "per se." If it's so valuable, why isn't it on the balance sheet? I don't see data as even having intrinsic value, I'd maybe go with latent value.
2391 2018-01-02 19:14:54 If he's playing in a top-six role, I would say 20-25 goals and 35-40 points is a reasonable ask.
2392 2018-01-02 19:14:42 After dilly-dallying/checking prices like 5x, I bought a last minute ticket bc I thought it was a good deal. 
I got the date wrong, and had to cancel it, pray for a refund, and in the meantime drop $1k on a last-last minute ticket for the real dates. 
I’m 33 & read for a living.
2393 2018-01-02 19:14:35 or using the funds from selling 770m barrels of oil last year to arm the Houthis and Syria at the expense of the workers
2394 2018-01-02 19:14:23 Being oil in some demon’s lamp sounds pretty chill right now
2395 2018-01-02 19:14:14 The only one that ever did answer said"Yes scots are wrong cos scotland was conquered by England,so the oil and gas is English!!
2396 2018-01-02 19:14:07 How de Bruyne is still starting today is one mysterious thing
2397 2018-01-02 19:14:06 Still,  remain bearish crude oil..
2398 2018-01-02 19:13:56 The other fact is Alberta was bankrupt two to three years prior to the NDP ever governing. That was do to Conservative Ideology on oil royalties.
2399 2018-01-02 19:13:54 you realize the only people on this planet that don't believe global warming is a thing are republicans in the US, and the Republican reps. that are pushing it, campaigns are funded by the oil industry, who profit from products that hurt the environment.
2400 2018-01-02 19:13:49 Vicki, may I oil your whip? I like the sound!
2401 2018-01-02 19:13:45 Too bad they are leaking into Aquifers already.  No way to clean it up.  Goes into ground water that we drink. Garbage is bad too.  If the Nation would recycle we wouldn't have all that garbage but we would still have oil leaks.
2402 2018-01-02 19:13:42 Chappelle playing a blind klansman who doesn't know he's black is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
2403 2018-01-02 19:13:39 Crude oil futures pushing to record highs since mid 2015
2404 2018-01-02 19:13:39 I need to go get my oil changed
2405 2018-01-02 19:13:35 Because "your" backyard (#ANWR) is a #national wildlife refuge.  The #oil there will not only pollute our national heritage, but the world.  Reminding you of this is neither absurd nor insulting; we hope you will remember that short-term profit is not the bottom line in life...
2406 2018-01-02 19:13:32 今から行っても良いですか、、
2407 2018-01-02 19:13:22 Tumeric mask makes my skin pop but takes time to clear my dark spots. Im also using @CoriumSkincare Luxe Oil and Black soap but dol’s results

2413 2018-01-02 19:12:59 Ok guys i have problems. Actually i was reading some reviews about Cosmoderm tea tree oil that claimed to be good for oily skin and can heal pimples.....
2414 2018-01-02 19:12:46 They just instituted a VAT as a result of depressed oil prices actually.
2415 2018-01-02 19:12:35 Getting an oil change and they have a gourmet coffee maker here that is soo good.... so pretty much I'm never leaving.
2416 2018-01-02 19:12:18 Thats fair just curious what we could expect.
2417 2018-01-02 19:12:07 Provide me with your proof, I have provided you with mine. The Oil from a wind turbine leak is not as detrimental to the environment as a single oil pipeline leak. You can drag conversation wherever you want but fact is still fact.
2418 2018-01-02 19:12:00 Oh kasi ang oil industry hindi pa nagtake effect although if i understand it right kasama sya sa jan 1 effectivity ang weird lang
2419 2018-01-02 19:11:58 When they used oil burning steam locomotives they used steam from the locomotive too heat the oil in the tender
2420 2018-01-02 19:11:45 I’d love to be somewhere warm, naked and covered in oil basking in the sun.
2421 2018-01-02 19:11:36 Please don't forget that Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State signed the largest oil & gas deal in the world at Putin's home in Sochi...it is not a coincidence he is Sec of State & we have a titanic hole in our State Dept.
2422 2018-01-02 19:11:22 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2423 2018-01-02 19:11:16 the hot chocolate at great canadian oil change makes getting my oil changed not suck
2424 2018-01-02 19:11:16 I've been on the hunt for a good primer oil, @DianaChantel do you recommend any?
2425 2018-01-02 19:11:15 I've been rubbing flaxseed oil on my forehead. My IQ has gone up 10 points. 

*cue Mickey Rivers' snappy comeback*
2426 2018-01-02 19:11:09 I don't like the metaphor either, but is this really the difference? Raw oil has a value only by virtue of what you can do with it as well. Seems to me this is an infinite regression of instrumental vs intrinsic value.
2427 2018-01-02 19:11:07 In all honesty, the only counting stat that matters for Maroon is goals. Finished with 42 points last season but think we can all agree he's been nowhere near as effective. Give me 25 goals and I'm happy.
2428 2018-01-02 19:10:59 @kyspykes anyone wanna play some superfight, or Snake Oil on tabletop simulator later?
2429 2018-01-02 19:10:57 my air freshner thingy mustve tipped over last night while unplugged and now my whole room smells strong af cuz the oil got on the floor smh
2430 2018-01-02 19:10:50 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
2431 2018-01-02 19:10:50 Your American guest is talking shite and yoi know it. Sanctions ALWAYS have an impact on economies. That's what they are designed to do. Indeed the sanctions TARGETTED investment in oil/gas industry and it's sale of refined oil products...
2432 2018-01-02 19:10:48 I meant. Are u taking biotin or using anything? I’ve tried that at castor oil
2433 2018-01-02 19:10:44 @oicl_csd

2434 2018-01-02 19:10:42 They had it until BP oil and British terrorism in 1950s...read the history
2435 2018-01-02 19:10:37 エルザに殴られたなう
2436 2018-01-02 19:10:32 Could this be a signal from the oil and gas industry that they think a new dark lord will be counter productive to their interests? The last one did generate articles asking "with friends like this who needs enemies".
2437 2018-01-02 19:10:18 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
2438 2018-01-02 19:10:12 A vial of oil labelled “Tomonari’s anointmente forr long swordes and other weppons of the disttinguished nobelemann.”
2439 2018-01-02 19:09:58 Your child was pierced by a sharp rusted object, please visit the hospital as soon as possible. Don't use knife and palm oil heated in fire. It won't stop the dangers of Tetanus infection #2018healthgoals
2440 2018-01-02 19:09:32

2442 2018-01-02 19:09:24 Oil, gas and mining - long 2018
2443 2018-01-02 19:09:14 Hahaha! There's no need to Sponsor Terrorism in Pakistan, it's like exporting Oil to Dubai.
2444 2018-01-02 19:09:12 i buy the same salad every time i go lmao just lettuce, tomato, chicken, avocado + olive oil and balsamic vinegar ;w; i’m a Simple Binch
2445 2018-01-02 19:08:55 My vegan ones have black beans and breadcrumbs (I prefer blending these for consistency). Standard seasoning (salt, pepp, garlic powder, slight cayenne). Pretty finely chopped onion, green chillies, and I adore cilantro. I liked to freeze mine and cook them in oil later
2446 2018-01-02 19:08:53 My plate is oily and I can't remember putting oil
2447 2018-01-02 19:08:48 I’ve been boycotting BP sinc they spilled oil in the gulf so...
2448 2018-01-02 19:08:46 Besides that we wandered off course here we are talking about the difference between an oil leak on a wind turbine and a pipeline.
2449 2018-01-02 19:08:37 Bleach the palm oil. The eggs would come out with a different nice taste tho
2450 2018-01-02 19:08:08 @FoxNews week in fact list Trump let’s china get away with murder are trade in balance with China is through the roof and Chyna letting North Korea have the oil is another slap in the face to trump who has done nothing except for lie and distort the truth constantly consistently
2451 2018-01-02 19:08:05 nope, it may not favor all skin types but it certainly works for some. I oil cleanse with coconut or olive oil...a charm .
2452 2018-01-02 19:08:00 Don't mind them...they forget that most commercially available vegetable oils are decolourised, deodorised and hydrogenated palm oil.
2453 2018-01-02 19:07:58 I can't buy the Harry Potter book set because my car needs an oil change. Thanks a lot Bruce

2456 2018-01-02 19:07:46 FYI the virus is going around pukies running amuck .Drink plenty of clear fluids and 3 drops of ingestible peppermint oil helps ease the tummy and when its time to hurl it helps with the bad taste .
2457 2018-01-02 19:07:44 Happy New Year 

Here’s to healthy edgesmoisturized hair no judgement on how African women chose to wear their hair/wigs poppin Afros growing strong locs and of course bucket loads of coconut oil  

PS:We’re showing more and more love to our natural hair
2458 2018-01-02 19:07:29 I keep missing my oil change appointment
2459 2018-01-02 19:07:25 Whoever is Uhuru's adviser must be a bad schemer.With almost half of Kenya rejecting him as a legitimate president, they've poured more oil on the fire, rendering youth jobless by increasing tax on betting companies to 35percent,forcing SportPesa to withdraw sports sponsorship.
2460 2018-01-02 19:07:22 Nonresidential Investment was high in 2017 (not as high as some recent years). This was driven by an oil sector that bubbled, crashed, and is now growing again. The rest of the economy is OK. GDP potential is still hurt by factors in my previous post. Tax cuts effect pending...
2461 2018-01-02 19:07:19 Hes on pace for over 40 pts this year how much can you expect of him?
2462 2018-01-02 19:07:09 Oil & Gas or Finance is what I'm looking at. You know I appreciate any help habibi and would be really blessed if you could. Miss you Bo 3alwa.
2463 2018-01-02 19:06:52 Remember the south park episode where dp oil accidentally summoned cthulu and made that apology video?
Yeah thats what logan paul sounds like rn
2464 2018-01-02 19:06:48 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match
2465 2018-01-02 19:06:47 Good we need the revenue generated from oil to help pay for all of the Politicians  overspending.
2466 2018-01-02 19:06:45 Remember China teapots are designed to take fuel oil and residue from the National oil companies and therefore more likely as we have seen to import medium/heavy crude.
2467 2018-01-02 19:06:38 If we can't pay teachers like politicians and judges. Let us pay them like oil workers. The human mind is the ultimate oil. Same can be said for the police, someone should take that up.
2468 2018-01-02 19:06:17 Japan and Germany were aided by massive US loans and investment. Cuba received US$8 million dollars a day + oil for decades from the Soviet Union ... let's tell the whole truth. Every "fact" must be told in the right context - not half truths.
2469 2018-01-02 19:06:14 Calling all Men with beards I have a question? If you were to use an oil based moisturizer designed to moisturize and promote healthy hair/growth and get rid of ingrown hairs/acne 

Would you prefer it in a glass spray bottle or a glass bottle w/dropper?! 
2470 2018-01-02 19:06:14 Heard on NPR (liberals) this a.m. how "angry" Pakistan is about the POTUS' tweet yesterday! My response? Tough shit Paki's! The truth hurts , doesn't it! Been selling oil to terrorists over the years, harboring said terrorists is truth!
2471 2018-01-02 19:06:06 Understand my special definitely fellow U.K. chap friend. Once, lack of special capitalist oil made my wheels stick. Could not make way to definitely real village fate in English village where I definitely live. No happy vodka smiles that day! Nostrovia!
2472 2018-01-02 19:05:58 I actually put Bag- Balm or coconut oil or Eucarin on my face and hands when I have to be out in extreme cold. Anything below freezing is horrible for your face, especially if it is windy out.
2473 2018-01-02 19:05:54 The Dossier says Russians paid for a trip for Michael Flynn. That is a fact.

It says former Trump Adviser Carter Page was in Russia multiple times during & after the campaign. That is a fact.

It says Page met with Russian oil company Rosneft. That is another fact.

Not “bogus.”
2474 2018-01-02 19:05:48 My face is dying of dryness! I cleanse with coconut oil then finish with more of that plus some organic aloe but it’s NOT cutting it this winter. Any moisturizer brands y’all can recommend?

2477 2018-01-02 19:05:43 Those rascally climate scientists making all that sweet $$ and living large. Meanwhile transnational oil/coal companies with hundreds of billions in profits are courageously being the maverick truth tellers. 

Do go on.
2478 2018-01-02 19:05:31 Needs a little more oil on the left thigh.
2479 2018-01-02 19:05:26 @GregaHorvatFX what’s your view on oil? I expect a pull back
2480 2018-01-02 19:05:04 2 Gov will guarantee inefficient jobs, growth will slow, UE will rise, the cry will be for more intervention , inflation will be blamed on Venezsuelan oil prices or similar and not Gov pol & on it will go , a glorious #socialistcesspit .We've seen it all before
2481 2018-01-02 19:04:55 I'm still amazed that some equatorial country hasn't gotten ahead of the game and started building a commercial space launch center, especially one with oil revenue to leverage, eg. Venezuela.
2482 2018-01-02 19:04:52 I need to change my oil but this cold man
2483 2018-01-02 19:04:47 At some point these shysters forgot the crucial final step to the snake oil con: be counties away before ur customers notice it’s poison.
2484 2018-01-02 19:04:44 I will NEVER forget the day me and Whitney got so fucking high and she got peppermint essential oil in her eye I couldn’t do nothing but die laughing that shit was hilarious cause she was going CRAZY @pytwhit

2491 2018-01-02 19:04:17 Oil & gas co's big winners – winning increased ability to write-off new equip expenditures & in part bc the final bill that will open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling in a move Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, says will bring the govt $1 bil in revenue over 10 years.
2492 2018-01-02 19:04:17 No. It's simpler. #Iran was a rich and happy place under the Shah until the Carter/Bush/Clinton crime syndicate deposed him, brought back foreign oil firms and installed a radical religious ruler who has since brought destruction to the . Let #TheStorm Make Iran Nice Again!
2493 2018-01-02 19:04:09 Are these the same scientists who said we were running out of oil in the 70s????
2494 2018-01-02 19:03:58 Conspiring DURING transition? Is that even possible? Seems vastly different than claims made for Special Counsel to begin with.
2495 2018-01-02 19:03:22 Russia is selling them oil, what are you doing about that?
2496 2018-01-02 19:03:21 Applying to jobs while getting an oil change
2497 2018-01-02 19:03:20 200m to any politician of today in Nigeria is peanuts. Just to oil their political machines in like 10 wards in 1 area council. High time we know this our democracy is fake and elitist. Na ordinary Nigerian ds kain money dey trip, it is just for a day logistics to politicians.
2498 2018-01-02 19:03:11 Didn’t realize it takes 3 hours for an oil change
2499 2018-01-02 19:02:58 Uh oh. Is somebody watching what the kid is doing with the military? We better not be mobilizing to intervene. We have enough oil. Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past, please.
2500 2018-01-02 19:02:57 Some people overlook the red oil business. But that market is worth investing in! 200k is enough to make you twice as much at the end of the season

2508 2018-01-02 19:02:25 Lead us to salvation. Pour that oil please.
2509 2018-01-02 19:02:22 Deep condition once a week with coconut oil, castor oil and rosehip seed oil. Try to avoid using heat and damaging chemical products. You’ll have a healthy moisturized head and it promotes hair growth!!
2510 2018-01-02 19:02:19 New Year's resolution: get my oil changed before my oil light comes on.

2512 2018-01-02 19:02:14 Well baring a huge turnaround I think they have to look at one of 27/4 this offseason. But if Maroon took 3rd line money with term? Say 3x4/5yrs?
2513 2018-01-02 19:02:10 Painting a cool ass oil painting in my robe while listening to some nice jams. 2018 is already an obese vibe
2514 2018-01-02 19:02:09 In Norfolk and in need of something to do for the next three hours as my oil gets changed! 
2515 2018-01-02 19:02:08 Does Indomie have in built oil?
2516 2018-01-02 19:02:00 Earlier rarely alliances between Iyer/Iyengar, Madhwa/Smartha, 
Like mixing oil and water inspite of being Brahmins

2517 2018-01-02 19:01:56 You can repeat the same thing, he won't listen. Altcoiners have trouble spotting snake oil wild claims.
2518 2018-01-02 19:01:53 New Product Alert!  We are now carrying a variety of products from our friends at Genesis Pharms.  We have tincture, RSO, and massage oil.

2523 2018-01-02 19:01:29 A tortoise folklore that saw to him capturing an elephant by cunningly luring him to a ditch through feeding the elephant with palm oil fried akara soaked in honey.

The real hero of that story is the palm oil fried akara soaked in honey. Try it.
2524 2018-01-02 19:01:20 Oil & Propane prices will continue to rise even tho there is a glut of American  oil on the market. Refineries bottom line explodes in this kind of bitter cold weather. Capitalism at its finest!!!!!

2527 2018-01-02 19:01:02 As someone who actually is ignorant of the situation, why do we like Israel so much? Why are we, from my understanding, helping them gain control of more land? Oil? Money? Bases near our enemies?
2528 2018-01-02 19:01:01 Eat lots of coconut oil, very powerful anti viral! Will speed up your recovery, also vitamin c xxx
2529 2018-01-02 19:00:48 Common sense... Oil prices are volatile. As long as your refineries as not working, you cannot determine pump prices unless you subsidize.
2530 2018-01-02 19:00:46 OIL DIFF: 6.51 -> 6.54
2531 2018-01-02 19:00:45 Even the non-popular red oil business is good enough for 30k. Honestly
2532 2018-01-02 19:00:43 As a human being my instant reaction to smelling Jojoba oil is to feel sick and like im gonna vomit
2533 2018-01-02 19:00:43 Use coconut oil (I like the Palmers brand)
2534 2018-01-02 19:00:39 For me?  D and B12.  Magnesium.  A totally different multi and fish oil. But I think the trick is the new doc, who’s integrative and actually checks vitamin levels and worries about gut health.  I learned brands matter.  Give me a call if you want the whole story. I feel BETTER.

2537 2018-01-02 19:00:28 It's a flight-to-security asset, too. But oil & gas are going away as major commodities, & there's multiple, huge operations planning to mine asteroids - which blows out the value of rare metals.
2538 2018-01-02 19:00:27 While it's a start, there are many more environmental priorities  (coal, pipelines oil spills) that require immediate attention and solutions which I believe IS happening. I'm hopeful re: solar panels. #PaperOrPlastic

2541 2018-01-02 19:00:17 If you check the video, his Q does 105dmg per hit at lvl 6, add the dmg from burning oil and trait, he seems to be able to clear lane just fine. Plus he has an escape and self sustain too!
2542 2018-01-02 19:00:06 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
2543 2018-01-02 18:59:57 Ever done Italian thing, tearing up bits of fresh soft bread and dipping them in XV olive oil? Found out how well it coated my throat this winter, reduced my more nervous instinctive inhaler hits. Made LDN life more bearable 4sure. Get well soon! Frag that sickness, don't tag it!
2544 2018-01-02 18:59:52 Finally about to see about getting my oil pan fixed
2545 2018-01-02 18:59:48 I miss the oil headlines
2546 2018-01-02 18:59:46 @Thom_Hartmann I think less than 10% of USA knows we overthrew Iran’s democratically elected government in 1950s &installed a puppet regime so we could get cheap oil. We destroyed that great nation...we created that disaster...it’s never spoken about..disappointed u don’t say it.
2547 2018-01-02 18:59:33 I lived on the street for part of the Getty recession. There is nothing about being poor that I don't already know. Why are you against a tax that helps diversify our economy, and that oil companies are in favor of?
2548 2018-01-02 18:59:19 Mines On 15% RT @Genuine_Chyna: Still need to get a oil change 
2549 2018-01-02 18:59:06 I usually get the regular beef one because I can add the hot pepper oil myself, the spicy one's too hot for me. Other than that cheesy milk is different, but pretty good! Miso, Thai, and curry. :)
2550 2018-01-02 18:59:04 I said goodbye to my family in India but I also left the 100% pure coconut oil from the family farm hand pressed by my great-aunt and I think we all know which I regret more.
2551 2018-01-02 18:59:04 4 Bertolli olive oil
2552 2018-01-02 18:59:00 2018 resolution: cook more fried foods at home.

I'm always leery because so messy and dealing with the oil after is no fun. 

But now I'm armed with better recipes where I can split up most of the prep over a few days. Let's go, 2018!
2553 2018-01-02 18:58:40 If "oil experts" is meant to be "oil exports", that's a big enough typo to bother fixing. That said, the article is suspect from beginning to end, hypothesizing that tyrants are perfectly sincere and consistent in their stated beliefs.
2554 2018-01-02 18:58:34 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

2557 2018-01-02 18:58:02 I’ve been @Kia for the last 2 hours waiting for an oil change.....
2558 2018-01-02 18:58:01 I haven’t come across that many black queer woman in my city. I know a lot of qwoc but it would be dope to have a shawty that gets me on THAT level. Rub coconut oil in each other’s hair type of love. No one complaining about being late cause Black people time kinda love, ya dig?

2560 2018-01-02 18:57:38 Lol. I got new tires and oil so I dont have money to go anywhere on them now. 
2561 2018-01-02 18:57:20 SUPER excited about all the legislation changes that Trump slipped in over break. Aren't you? These seem like super-awesome-ideas. 
1. repealing protections enacted as a result of Deepwater Horizon. <- that was a good time, amirite? who needs protection from an oil spill?
2562 2018-01-02 18:57:17 I'M SO READY TO PAINT BIGASS OIL PAINTINGS OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
2563 2018-01-02 18:57:09 If it's on the cheap, I'd have little issue with it. He certainly has some chemistry with McDavid and clearly seems to fit in well with the group. Problem is having both he and Lucic in the same lineup every night.
2564 2018-01-02 18:57:07 Me revienta que se pongan a pensar en el servicio militar que falta para que vayan los chicos, en vez de disfrutarlos ahora y todo el tiempo que falta para que vayan, no sean pendejas y dejen de pensar en lo malo loco y piensen lo bueno
2565 2018-01-02 18:57:00 Alhamdulillah. Semoga terus dimurahkan rezeki. Takde rezeki dalam oil and gas. Kita layan construction semula. Kuantan-melaka-kuantan.
2566 2018-01-02 18:56:55 CFCs caused hole in our protective ozone layer, not warming! same scientists who discovered & fixed it now working on climate change! difference then: banning CFCs didn't affect profits of big oil, who've spent billions casting doubt in public mind on science of climate change.
2567 2018-01-02 18:56:52 Govt should lower taxes imposed on companies including sportpesa and honda, heavy taxes have made them withdraw their sponsorship this will oil soccer in this country contravening jubilee promis of naturing sport in this country

2570 2018-01-02 18:56:36 It is super windy here today!!! Must mean that the Earth is spinning faster. We should probably appoint an oil tycoon to lead a state department to research this new phenomenon
2571 2018-01-02 18:56:28 1. Despite the Shah’s continuing power struggle with the Prime Minister, he still believed that Mossadegh was the most qualified to bring the oil nationalization crisis to a satisfactory conclusion, and initially resisted intense pressure from both the British and Americans.
2572 2018-01-02 18:56:28 That’s pretty beefy... video says oil+fire= wave clear. I’m not at a computer for a bit, but those numbers definitely suggest tank with slow(s)/stun as well. Thanks for the info. With 55AA what is his APS?
2573 2018-01-02 18:56:21 the rare times Kenney and his ilk criticize the regime, it’s in a roundabout way to promote expansion of Canada’s oilsands in order to offset “Saudi oil"
2574 2018-01-02 18:56:17 I like the hypocrisy of Britain and the US over the Iran protests since it was MI6 + the CIA who deposed the democraticly elected government and installed a brutal dictator which lead to the revolution in the 1st place so we could steal their oil
2575 2018-01-02 18:56:14 Ok.. so I chop it up and throw it in a pan with some oil?
2576 2018-01-02 18:56:04 A mild, sweeter salsa to flavor your favorite healthy dishes  Mix chopped tomatoes, chopped green chilies, salt, pepper, and equal parts olive oil & balsamic vinegar. Yum!!  #vegan #lowfodmap #salsa #recipe
2577 2018-01-02 18:56:02 More oil painted children’s books! Hmm. With texture? 
2578 2018-01-02 18:55:59 We're over this cold situation! What are some of your beauty must haves to keep your skin soft in the winter? We love oil cleansing #Winter #Skincare #BeautyTips #sheworks4thepretty
2579 2018-01-02 18:55:52 Disagree.  Situation in Iran is an internal uprising by lower class & lower middle class people who are fed up.  Can't be explained as a plot to obtain more oil profits.
2580 2018-01-02 18:55:46 We'd have so many more jobs, without the sub's, too. And not just oil, but tourism, our own navy (for fisheries protection) and a deep water container port; would all be feasible.
2581 2018-01-02 18:55:44 Waiting to get my oil changed and the guy across from me is sleeping and snoring loud af 
2582 2018-01-02 18:55:23 I love cooking but the worst part is getting scorched by the oil 
2583 2018-01-02 18:54:58 I think setting personal health goals is great, and I encourage more consciousness in that regard, but Whole Foods people act like they're better than others because they shell out more dough for their pre-made Kale Chips baked with Avocado oil and covered in Himalayan salt™
2584 2018-01-02 18:54:58 Worked at the bar last night, a double between both jobs today, another double tomorrow, I’ve needed an oil change for like 3 weeks, everything is fine

2586 2018-01-02 18:54:33 #humbled to announce that I’ve #booked my first appointment of 2018!! I’ll be getting the oil changed and tires checked on my car tomorrow at 8am!
2587 2018-01-02 18:54:20 I’d be curious if the ask had slipped enough that signing him is a better idea?
2588 2018-01-02 18:54:14 Mine too. My poor oil furnace never rests, plus I had to get two space heaters. Oil is almost $3 a gallon. "MAGA". 
2589 2018-01-02 18:54:08 The Dimms have dug deep and for a lone period of time, they should have struck oil in Russia by now.
2590 2018-01-02 18:54:05 Does it drip down your legs and make your shoes slip off? (This is the problem I had with eucalyptus oil anti-bug spray.)
2591 2018-01-02 18:54:00 i burned my hand with oil and then i burned the same spot with scalding hot water im definitely getting stuff done this year
2592 2018-01-02 18:53:52 I heard it, as a metaphor. Like "Snake oil".
What is it for?
2593 2018-01-02 18:53:44 I'm with da oil , but the pills is a double negative 
2594 2018-01-02 18:53:37 I heard about olive oil but I was skeptical about putting oil in my ear lol, how does that come out
2595 2018-01-02 18:53:23 I’d rather hold on to him so long as it’s third line money or low 2nd line money. I’d even be fine with a long term deal if the cap is right
2596 2018-01-02 18:53:15 My aunt was very artsy and did oil portraits and other scenery/ I don’t think she ever had a real job, she lived off men- cause she could !! Lol
2597 2018-01-02 18:53:15 I’m not allowed to eat anything with dairy, pepper, or oil and they’ve decided to make pounded yam and egusi for dinner. Just looking at my plate of white rice and lightly seasoned chicken with tears in my eyes

2601 2018-01-02 18:52:49 The recent spike in oil prices and its derivatives such as LPG over recent months means it is even more important to make sure you’re getting the best buying price in the market place.
Speak to us today to find out how much you could be saving on your annual Bulk LPG supply.
2602 2018-01-02 18:52:19 I just need to get home to my oil diffuser & my dog.
2603 2018-01-02 18:51:57 This is high level of corruption and incompetence among #Putin’s mafia circle rather than low oil prices that have eaten Russian sovereign reserve fund
2604 2018-01-02 18:51:50 Job growth doesn’t always mean more employment. Yes, Obama created jobs, but doesn’t mean that everyone got those jobs. Obama also saw millions of jobs lost in various fields like oil. Also we don’t truly know how many people are unemployed because of the people who stop looking
2605 2018-01-02 18:51:43 There’s natural beef flavor in them, they put it in the oil. I suppose you could argue it’s a byproduct and technically not vegan then but I still stay away 
2606 2018-01-02 18:51:42 The 2018 file 'to the surprise of none' begins @Todd_Murphy1 with strength of industrial and precious metals, oil infrastructure, crude and natural gas. 

Todd, we've been discussing this for months and was clear as the brightest blue sky. Looking forward to 2018 and beyond.

2610 2018-01-02 18:51:26 Geopolitical tensions in #MiddleEast, #Venezuela n parts of #Africa may further boost global #oil prices although first quarter of calendar year generally witnesses seasonal weak demand.

2617 2018-01-02 18:50:51 Lo de Iran traerá cola... se lanzará sobre Arabia Saudí.  A Iran le apoyarán Rusia y China, a Arabia EEUU... desde la guerra Iran/Irak de los 80 esa zona es inestable. Nadie encuentra el equilibrio o mejor, no interesa. Con ello juegan para influir en las crisis económicas. OIL.

2619 2018-01-02 18:50:21 Alberta oil producers must pay the tax, Nigerian oil producers don’t

Oil is priced globally, Alberta can’t raise the price to cover that added cost. It becomes impossible to compete globally

Same as Alberta beef or grain, US has advantage

Consumer will choose cheaper products

2631 2018-01-02 18:48:44 There is a push in America to privatize public lands for private profit. Utah politician Chris Stewart has introduced the Stewart Amendment to allow mass euthanasia of wild horses. Why? Because he is tool of mining/oil industries who want use of our public lands.

2641 2018-01-02 18:47:13 Difficulty is showing that it’s Russian or Chinese government sponsored, and that it breaches the sanctions as there is a cap rather than a total ban on oil transfers 4m Barrels/year of crude and 0.5m barrels/year of refined product.
Some US news outlets seem to miss this.
2642 2018-01-02 18:47:11 The level of iman by traders in this estate is so mashaAllah,they leave their shops to pray 
2643 2018-01-02 18:46:55 @drift_rat Hear you there! Did you get that oil changed?
2644 2018-01-02 18:46:42 "Men don't pump gas and change oil." "Women dont cook and clean the house"....said two probably broke people with misplaced priorities.
2645 2018-01-02 18:46:21 No worries , soon Hezbollah will be gone, once we cut off  the oil money to you and terroist friends.
2646 2018-01-02 18:46:11 @AntAnstead Hey Ant. Loved you on the new wheeler dealers but quick question about your hands? How do you keep them so clean with all the oil and rebuilding work?
2647 2018-01-02 18:46:08 A destabilized #Iran would still pump the oil so one side or the other could get hard currency. At the same time consumption would fall to zero. This 'remainder' would then be exported to the #US & West. 

It's all about the oil.
2648 2018-01-02 18:45:58 girl what natural oil???
2649 2018-01-02 18:45:36 Evening... Have you tried putting eucalyptus oil in a burner / jar with hot water the aroma will clear your head throat & chest also try putting some (abt 10 drops)  on your pillow before you go to sleep... alternatively have a dram warm water & whiskey with honey get well soon
2650 2018-01-02 18:45:33 Oil independence is a JOKE. We need to be using alternative fuels that don’t harm our environment. Solar, wind, all of it is renewable. Oil is a commodity only because the oil tycoons pay for it to be so.
2651 2018-01-02 18:45:20 Starting off the year by diffusing lemon and cedar oil and organizing my sock drawer
2652 2018-01-02 18:45:13 I recently started learning watercolor and my painting technique from oil paints really affected my process. Started watching how-to videos and process streams on Twitter. I love your work and I am excited to see what you make. Love your process posts so please post here as well!
2653 2018-01-02 18:45:12 Having a fancy car is nice & all until you have to get an oil change & no one has the “special tool” to do it 
2654 2018-01-02 18:45:04 Yes it’s a take on shepherds pie, with Aubergine & mushrooms, with a creamy Parsnip purée top. Finely chop the Aubergine & cook with shallots for 30 minutes on a low heat with olive oil & butter, add dried ceps (rinsed) chopped fresh mushrooms & Truffles cook 30 mins top with Prs

2656 2018-01-02 18:44:54 Oh give this a break. The NDP and the Liberals are helping citizens. They are no different than the PCs and the UCP. All political parties are the same. They serve themselves not us. One eg. $235 million loan to big oil by NDP for orphan well program. Libs give $30 million too
2657 2018-01-02 18:44:39 Yup militancy. Paved way for these oil companies to move to Lagos.

2661 2018-01-02 18:44:11 I think you people (host communities) need to protect this type of institution (NCDMB) and Oil companies. Companies move to the West because their youths and communities protect them and in return, employment and other benefits are given to them.

2664 2018-01-02 18:44:00 thank you for your tweet on use of opiods. I totally agree that the use of opiods is out of control. I recently used CBD oil instead of opiods for severe pain prior to hip replacement and suffered no side effects. There are other options to opiods also.

2680 2018-01-02 18:41:54 ohhh that is smart. I wish I thought of that cuz I was trying to minimize heat exposure. Also if you got  argan oil, use a little bit on hair to prevent heat damage.
2681 2018-01-02 18:41:49 Under which calendar is New Year's Day not a cosmically arbitrary event?
2682 2018-01-02 18:41:47 No I don't. I think his camp would use a potential offer as a negotiating tool/hammer first. For one thing, an outside club cannot offer an 8th year, which he got from the Oil.
2683 2018-01-02 18:41:34 Also, Sheryl Sandberg has been deleting accounts since her first day on the job + Israel is now openly calling the shots.

ICYMI.

Also, neolibs  censorship like neocons love oil.
2684 2018-01-02 18:41:34 All valid but my question is why have none been addressed? These were the same issues they had in the summer. To think, all those years of losing & they arguably have little to trade b/c other pieces were given away. Not a good look.
2685 2018-01-02 18:41:34 @ThomasCookUK have definitely coated their leaflets (which ive just received sealed in the post), in coconut oil. Cheeky, tempting technique
2686 2018-01-02 18:41:26 Thank you for this very important tip. I always wondered if it’s the oil before the moisturiser or the moisturiser over oil.
2687 2018-01-02 18:41:15 If you try to expose the madness, you could be blocked from social media. Now gulf oil money is invested in social media too. To block people's voice against those Jihadi bullies.

2690 2018-01-02 18:40:58 Look toward Iran.  Mohammad bin Salman wants a destabilized gov in Iran in order to eliminate oil price competition.  Trump will help. My guess is additional troops into Afghanistan will soon be deployed into Iran. If so, it will be years before we exit.

2694 2018-01-02 18:40:28 You know, with all the money that coal and oil companies make, they could be smart and start investing in making cheap, green energy. How? Hire grad students who study green energy to make it happen. That way the companies still have their large income while helping the Earth.
2695 2018-01-02 18:40:27 Dems not flat out cruel... they vote for war, over and over again too. In the blue state of California Diane Feinstein votes for tax cuts, death penalty, war, fracking.

2704 2018-01-02 18:39:49 They went down the conspiracy path long ago because they and their friends depend on the oil industry. Efforts to challenge global warming threatened their jobs, so they wanted believe websites, "news" sources, and politicians who said it was a conspiracy.

1. Another proxy war?
2. Selling more drones, airplanes, helicopters, arms? 
3. Hiring military contractors, like Erik Prince? 
4. Red herring? 
5. Squeezing Iran, so we can get their oil?

2764 2018-01-02 18:33:34 It's great!! You can use it for your face, body, hair, laundry, dishes, etc. A little goes a long way. It doesnt have those fake foaming agents either. The peppermint oil gives you a refreshing tingling feeling after too.

2778 2018-01-02 18:32:15 They have 100% natural products, be having shxt like "mango with black seed oil"
2779 2018-01-02 18:32:08 Like you didn't let down @StandingRockST or #BlackLivesMatter I watched militarized police beat, shot with rubber bullets concussion grenades, chemical and sound weapons, psy ops to protect an oil pipeline that is killing us all.
2780 2018-01-02 18:32:01 You'll be sorry.
2781 2018-01-02 18:31:53 Brakes are one of the easiest things to change on a car next to oil. Would cost you 30$ instead of several hundreds from a shop. Save yourselves some cash and get to get'n.

2783 2018-01-02 18:31:25 Its oil fish, freedom and democracy is coming then
2784 2018-01-02 18:31:22 What are you going to do to Russia and China for supplying No. Korea with oil? Send them angry old man tweets. Lol
2785 2018-01-02 18:31:22 Can’t imagine my life without my young living peppermint essential oil 
2786 2018-01-02 18:31:20 Still so crazy that I start working with one of the biggest oil corporations next week. 2018 will be blessed.
2787 2018-01-02 18:30:42 I have cbd oil, but it doesn’t seem to do much for me 
2788 2018-01-02 18:30:36 Question: is @Twitter controlled by Western law [no matter the designation] or stolen Arab oil money used to invest in Western Corporations to instil their backward mentality to those who would prefer NOT to be dictated to? 
2789 2018-01-02 18:30:36 If you think lobbying for Russia is insane you aren’t paying much attention to the insanity that is K Street in general.  Russia paying someone to rep their oil is “lobbying for Russia”. Trying to convince a congressman of anything is “lobbying”.  Let’s keep it real.
2790 2018-01-02 18:30:32 I need to take my old truck to get an oil change, an inspection sticker and a window fixed and frankly... I don't wanna.
2791 2018-01-02 18:30:28 OIL DIFF: 6.5 -> 6.53
2792 2018-01-02 18:30:27 And your buddies in China and Russia continue to supply them with oil. Way to lay down the law.

2796 2018-01-02 18:30:13 In the age of a Post Truth online society, where does the Influencer fit? Seems like it should go the way of snake oil salesmen
2797 2018-01-02 18:30:09 future carbon emissions. Oil companies are still injustices in the UK (and perhaps still use) surreptitious rape to improve working
2798 2018-01-02 18:29:50 Thank you to admitting that. Army like you are rare as oil 
Don't feel guilty by the bilshit that others armys did, admitting your fandom's fault it's enough

2802 2018-01-02 18:29:31 Does anybody know of any marijuana based sleep or eating products that work well? (That don't have to be smoked) Maybe an oil or something.

2804 2018-01-02 18:28:53 You gotta use Bio Oil like a 100000x before you start to see the positive effects lol
2805 2018-01-02 18:28:52 After Chinese oil tankers were caught off loading to NK tankers, this is kind of late news of the obvious.
2806 2018-01-02 18:28:48 That's probably actually been the most frustrating thing about the Russell contract: it killed the ability for the Oil to get any better on the blue line.
2807 2018-01-02 18:28:32 I roasted mine in sesame oil in the aga until crispy.
2808 2018-01-02 18:28:20 camille rose curl maker and moisture butter!!! and lots of castor oil lmao and do the "prayer hand" method lmao it was my first time doin it and my curls came out so defined!!

2810 2018-01-02 18:28:04 Waiting to get my trucks oil changed and the dude in the car waiting beside me proceeds to get out, and then pees on the fence. So, maybe we don’t start 2018 off like this?
2811 2018-01-02 18:27:57 ma da was a spark, knew another oan the boat that checked the clyde for oil - Said they knew oil was there, he was for added benefit a unionist and Labour man whole life.

2822 2018-01-02 18:27:27 Ever since i started using CBD oil for my neck injury, it has helped a lot! Super thankful for it.
(Fun fact: I fractured my C7 bone )
2823 2018-01-02 18:27:17 If I'm 11 minutes into a projected 30 min hold time with my oil company, I assume they can't up my oil delivery date? SIGH.
2824 2018-01-02 18:27:14 Beard oil all over my phone screen 
2825 2018-01-02 18:27:14 @Steve_Dangle I'm actually serious about this, think it would be awesome to get you here for Leafs/Oil. But clearly I don't know what life is like for you/what kind of reaction you have to weird guy from the internet :). DM so we can see what works or not, I'm a fan either way.
2826 2018-01-02 18:27:12 Peanut butter is gooey and delicious, yet it can remain at room temperature for months without spoiling. Low moisture levels and high oil content keep this butter from going bad for quite some time, but don't go ignoring that expiration date just yet.

2829 2018-01-02 18:26:46 Lianne has a single job to get olive oil while I wait on line. She comes back to the cart twice to drop off soup. Still no olive oil 
2830 2018-01-02 18:26:43 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world,  and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.

2833 2018-01-02 18:26:01 Do you have any idea why Japeneese bombed US during WW2? It was because U.S. Economic Warfare Provoked them to attack - we cut off their Oil & other raw material resources & the Japanese militarist were determined to get what they wanted at any cost. Sound familiar?
2834 2018-01-02 18:25:57 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
2835 2018-01-02 18:25:56 All this unsortable plastic waste should be burnt, huge calorific value, it’s made from oil after all.
2836 2018-01-02 18:25:38 it's such a scam! the only reason to pay $40 for fish oil is FOR the customized packet like what's even the point without it smh
2837 2018-01-02 18:25:36 What's more baffling is when they are given the opportunity, they are producing.
2838 2018-01-02 18:25:35 Well maybe if you stop stealing money and oil from middle east  and giving them away from american people to the country of death ( israel ) and leave middle east alone we can live and smell freedom ... your democracy is a big lie .. in Bahrain they are askin  for freedom also !
2839 2018-01-02 18:25:30 If #oil is so cheap, we do we sit in darkness?
If it's so valuable, why are we hungry?
2840 2018-01-02 18:25:20 Big Ben survived the World War! It's gonged perfectly every day since then, but rather than give the NHS £61m, they prefer to oil Big Ben's coils & springs instead. Fuckin' absurd how the UK is being run! In school you had Set1,2,3 & 4. Set1 were the brains, Set 4 are government!
2841 2018-01-02 18:25:14 Too much oil*

2843 2018-01-02 18:25:05 Tofu is lovely if slices dipped in oil/soy/five spice & roasted.  Great in a stir fry.
2844 2018-01-02 18:25:04 Also filed amicus briefs on Zarda (saying Title VII doesn't cover LGBT bias) and Murphy Oil (saying NLRA doesn't protect class actions). (And Spicer reiterated support for RTW in February.) Would be interested to hear how Trump would answer questions on any of these.

2852 2018-01-02 18:24:23 i think as an assitant coach, not a head coach. even if he did as a head coach it was in 2003 or 2004
2853 2018-01-02 18:23:59 @realDonaldTrump you need to stop listening to those dodgy advisors!they say anything.they want the oil off Iran.that's it.
2854 2018-01-02 18:23:58 I do! I have another for oil changes.
2855 2018-01-02 18:23:37 Oil export will initially be via road then pipeline to be constructed later.
2856 2018-01-02 18:23:34 Good news and bad news. The good news is that the transmission is not broken. It was just that the Trans oil was low. I refilled it and it's running good as new. Bad news is there is a bad leak that I can see under the car. Will be a cheaper fix. Thank God.
2857 2018-01-02 18:23:34 I'm with tomatoes fairy’s guts?!?! you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
2858 2018-01-02 18:23:28 Few drops of lavender essential oil on my pillow case every night and I’ve been sleeping like a baby. Those who have trouble sleeping or just wanna relax before bed I’d recommend this. 
2859 2018-01-02 18:23:20 Maybe too much sweet and oil doesn't suit you like me. I don't have aches and stuff but I get nauseous at the taste of too much in my food and eating too chocolaty or sweet foods make me feel real sick.
2860 2018-01-02 18:23:11 baking soda and water to form a thick paste. massage into skin where scars are. Leave it on for 2 min. Wash away with warm water. apply a good natural moisturizer. (Coconut or Olive oil)
2861 2018-01-02 18:22:40 My steel toe shoes say oil resistant and slip resistant but when I walk on nice concrete that's not wet or anything I slip. Why? @RedWingShoes
2862 2018-01-02 18:22:33 Excuse me, I'm not perfect like you and your country pretends to be. Take a look around and learn about another country before you attack it. You get 40% of your oil from us, not to mention the other resources we sell you for cheaper than what we pay I might add. Educate yourself

2866 2018-01-02 18:21:51 He need oil for his dry ass
2867 2018-01-02 18:21:49 Try chopping smoky bacon and carrots into small cubes, cook in mixture of butter and olive oil, then add the kale, cook until soft. Brassicas taste much better cooked without water.
2868 2018-01-02 18:21:48 Don't doubt that for a minute. I know he likes to think he's smarter than everyone else but the fact he has 1 cup on his resume tells me a different story. He acts like he's Scotty Bowman but is missing the necessary jewellery.
2869 2018-01-02 18:21:46 “There's no OIL in #Kashmir” said an American diplomat decades ago to a young Kashmiri journalist.
2870 2018-01-02 18:21:35 Trump has started work on populist legislation that will make it mandatory to pronounce oil “earl.”
2871 2018-01-02 18:21:33 The other reason for a modest warm-up was to get the oil to the temperature where it would do it's optimal level of protection, Most cars now run on a 5w30w  or similar 5w oil, but on a single didgit day that will be a little syrupy so a small warmup may be good.
2872 2018-01-02 18:21:30 It’s simple economics, as electric cars expand worldwide, demand for gas/oil will decrease thus raising the price. When gas prices increase, consumers with gas powered cars will be more incentivized to buy electric when buying a new car. It’s exponential growth for electric cars.
2873 2018-01-02 18:21:17 Oh how much i miss my brothers doing my oil changes 
2874 2018-01-02 18:21:13 Changed the homie’s muddy engine oil so he can drive back to New Mexico yesterday lol I hooked it up the Cali way
2875 2018-01-02 18:21:09 I love the sad resignation in his voice when the ladies know him more from his snake oil commercials than his HOF baseball career.
2876 2018-01-02 18:21:03 deep condition weekly, protein treatments monthly or after braids/sew ins. Keep your hair moisturized with oil (preferably olive oil or Jamaican castor oil). I found that detangling with your fingers instead of a comb decreases shedding/breakag too.

2878 2018-01-02 18:20:57 Nah but it's okay I don't like eating too oily stuff in the morning anyways I guess it's because I JUST woke up and BAM sugar and oil in my system yea I don't think my body prepared itself for it lol I forgot to mention the reason why my stomach hurt from drinking tea is because

2884 2018-01-02 18:20:21 I'm all for the government being fiscally responsible, but the caveat to that is this: the narrative that the NDP are irresponsible fiscally is built way more on the price of oil than any of their spending.
2885 2018-01-02 18:20:17 So glad I had today off for my New Year’s Day Do-over.! Oil change, Home Depot, doing my dogs laundry. A+ day.
2886 2018-01-02 18:20:17 Kicked the new year off by eating a kilo of my favorite Arabic dessert. The problem with that is it’s made of literally cheese and sugar, two food items I stay away from. It’s like Superman smoking kryptonite from an oil burner because he likes the high. #BadChoices #HappyNewYear – bij Up In Smoke

2889 2018-01-02 18:19:32 I can get behind this.  I definitely wrote a paper last year about how I agree with the legalization of medicinal marijuana and CBD oil, but I disagree with the legalization of recreational marijuana
2890 2018-01-02 18:19:13 2018 is gonna be a year of tough decisions. For example, my dog doesn’t like my new essential oil diffuser and now one has to go

2897 2018-01-02 18:18:20 Also, Iran can’t afford to drop exports, particularly to their key account, China. If they show a drop in crude oil exports one month out of Kharg Island, then it’s only because those tankers were used for exporting condensates out of Asaluyeh.

Money is honey, habibi.
2898 2018-01-02 18:18:09 Coconut oil is my best friend

2900 2018-01-02 18:17:46 Are you talking about smoking oil?? I’m so confused lmao

2903 2018-01-02 18:17:20 I quite agree. There is a new plastic made from food waste. This really needs to be pushed so we get away from the horrible oil based plastics.  It will become fish food when it ends up in the oceans! #organicplastic #somuchbetter
2904 2018-01-02 18:17:16 Any coach does. But if we win 3 cups then fire the coach I’m perfectly ok with that.
2905 2018-01-02 18:17:13 Russia's 2017 daily oil production climbs to 30-year high
2906 2018-01-02 18:16:54 I personally see it. I follow a lot of Toronto observers and they’re so similar. Systems heavy that get the mobile dmen involved, they play the goaltender hard, they play the vets hard in all situations instead of the talented kids (komarov for them, Letestu for us) etc.
2907 2018-01-02 18:16:53 Can Neil tell me why Oil prices continue to rise
2908 2018-01-02 18:16:49 It was the first time since January 2014 that the two crude oil benchmarks opened the year above $60 US per barrel. #yyc #alberta #calgary

2915 2018-01-02 18:16:05 Imagine if we were not warming the Earth through our anthropogenic methods! Maybe I will fire up the wood stove while also using the oil furnace. Thanks my POTUS, Happy New Year Sir!
2916 2018-01-02 18:15:34 I came to work cause time sheets are due. The payroll lady not even here. Should’ve took my car to get an oil change and Went home 
2917 2018-01-02 18:15:24 If by impact you mean China and Russia are openly providing oil, food, security and hard currency to the DPRK in violation of sanctions you would be correct. Those countries do not care what you think or want.  You are on full ignore.
2918 2018-01-02 18:15:19 Truth is like oil, it always comes to the surface. Italian proverb

2919 2018-01-02 18:15:17 Supporting diversified market access/pipelines to tidewater and opposing carbon pricing is illogical. Want to sell AB oil sands crude to China? India? They're pricing carbon. California prices carbon. Suncor, Cenovus, etc get it.

2921 2018-01-02 18:14:57 I'm very happy rn...lil broke but happy. My car is completely taken care of. Tire replaced, emissions and inspection passed and paid for, oil change done, and insurance paid for. Oon the bigger things im good for the year. Good way to start the year. Always dread the e/i part
2922 2018-01-02 18:14:50 ah, peppermint is an interesting one! didnt know it helped with staying awake--might just go out and get some peppermint oil; i've always liked its scent/flavor

but also re: cuties, a total throwback haha, haven't heard them called that since middle school (lots of nostalgia :b)
2923 2018-01-02 18:14:40 It may surprise you that I make my own housecleaner. Water, vinegar, and some lemon oil from Doterra. Safe and it smells good too!

2934 2018-01-02 18:13:39 Castor oil on my lashes and brows, coconut oil and shea butter on my lips, looking like im fresh out of the deep fryer

2936 2018-01-02 18:13:30 Same!  It shouldn't make a ton of difference to me personally who wins, and being that I work in construction and oil and gas primarily one could make the argument that the UCP could be better for my career (I don't buy that though).
2937 2018-01-02 18:13:30 Oil change coupon for Midas for the win! $20 and I’m on the road to Wise.
2938 2018-01-02 18:13:16 Coconut and grapeseed oil are also great!
2939 2018-01-02 18:13:14 Just as an fyi, as much Babcock is worshipped in TO & most hockey circles, we are already starting to hear those wondering aloud what the hell he is doing with the likes of Marner & Nylander. The hard love approach gets old fast

2944 2018-01-02 18:13:01 I'd love to know what Stevens has done to keep Quick healthy and to aid Kopitar's return from slump hell.
2945 2018-01-02 18:13:00 Oil hot. Flour newish .
2946 2018-01-02 18:13:00 The return to spray oil has been quite traumatic.
2947 2018-01-02 18:12:36 Yes! Essential oil for lots of uses!
2948 2018-01-02 18:12:36 My parents gave me pepper infused olive oil, which I'm using to make chili. Stay tuned.

2949 2018-01-02 18:12:29 Call me when he starts a war with Iraq for no good reason other than oil. Or sends kids to Viet Nam because he thinks it’s an “Easy win”. Until then Trump just sucks but he isn’t the worst.
2950 2018-01-02 18:12:09 Girl I was thinking like baby oil¿ lmaoooo like what you gon do with gallons of baby oil it’s not even that cold 
2951 2018-01-02 18:12:08 And of you don't have an electric steamer get one. €25 in Aldi or the like. Cook your fish & veg all at the same time without oils or butter.
If you do use oil buy Rapeseed oil, the lowest fat content of any oil in the world.

2954 2018-01-02 18:11:34 I love coconut oil as a body butter and safflower or canola even.
2955 2018-01-02 18:11:29 you gotta do an oil layer on damp skin BEFORE shea butter, but even then on the first I was ashy as hell on the first.
2956 2018-01-02 18:11:25 if you're not oil pulling every morning when you wake up now is your time to start. especially if you're smoking cigarettes or tobacco blunt wraps!!! 15 min right when you wake up before brushing or eating. thank me later.

2959 2018-01-02 18:11:01 some thoughts: 

lessen the need for oil in the mid to long term thru technology

cut oil subsidies, tax breaks and royalty give aways so development is less attractive

diversify Alberta's economy more

... then pipelines and marine shipments won't be required

2960 2018-01-02 18:10:57 I need a reputable mechanic in Madisonville are, who do you recommend? I'm having an oil pump issue and chrysler wants $197 to even look at it, even though I gave them the error code when I called. Ha. Pass.
2961 2018-01-02 18:10:48 how old is the flour? Or is the oil not hot enough when putting it in the oven
2962 2018-01-02 18:10:37 oh no hope you feel better! oregano oil!
2963 2018-01-02 18:10:36 Aw, geez. Now I'm on my way to get my oil changed. It's like we live on opposite sides of the world or something! ;)
2964 2018-01-02 18:10:36 Your question is akin to asking will the world survive at 25$ oil. Without thinking why prices will remain constant. They neither remain at 150 or 25. And its one factor.
2965 2018-01-02 18:10:34 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
2966 2018-01-02 18:10:33 Hopefully right after January meetings.... Dollar goes up which keeps oil prices down hopefully...
2967 2018-01-02 18:10:32 Oil price June 2017 was ~$46, Dec 2017 ~$60+?
2968 2018-01-02 18:10:26 You think it's a coincidence that the Kings are so much better this season compared to the last few? The Sutter approach has an even shorter shelf live in the here and now, compared to years gone by.

3042 2018-01-02 17:59:58 NE-ISO will pay generators to keep fuel oil on site. They will not pay generators to hold firm contracts. Maybe that's a preferable policy, but it certainly doesn't incentivize reliable gas supplies.

3050 2018-01-02 17:58:48 En Venezuela, nos hemos quedado sin gasolina. En Vzla, no hay gas oil. En Vzla, no hay aceites lubricantes “, dijo Iván Freites, secretario de la división profesional y técnico de la Federación Unida de Trabajadores Petroleros de Venezuela en una conferencia de prensa televisada.

3059 2018-01-02 17:57:13 Anything his oil cronies want, they get. He put @EPAScottPruitt  (pRuinIt) in EPA to ensure that's done ASAP. Evil Greedy Corrupt AF

3062 2018-01-02 17:56:54 They have been afflicted with the disease known as greed. They allow oil tycoons to line their pockets and fund their campaigns in exchange for loosening laws in Canada regarding foreign investment and regulations.
3063 2018-01-02 17:56:36 RT @PaulModica777: @adlver @realDonaldTrump It is called cyclical weather. In the late 70s early 80s it was just like this. It has been the way since the recorded history.

3072 2018-01-02 17:55:22 No more of a sutter/Crawford/Babcock type. Anyone that knows what it takes to win. McClellan obviously does not. Otherwise he would be changing the pp and pk up. Trying everything to win.
3073 2018-01-02 17:55:21 I buy beeswax in its 'unprocessed' form. I melt it (because it's rock hard) with raw shea butter and add oils like castor oil and coconot oil to make a body butter. Check  your local health shops
3074 2018-01-02 17:55:02 Yo I can really walk to the dispensary on my street to buy oil for my pen like nothing. Care free weed buying is beautiful

3076 2018-01-02 17:54:57 Agree and u might want to add chia seeds (the actual seeds are better) too. Eskinol toner is as nice. Tea tree oil works magic.
3077 2018-01-02 17:54:46 The world is in edge only due to trumps instability and the WH incompetence.  The US is the only Country responsible for this. Soon the UN will respond with sanctions on the US. Good luck with no oil. Comment from a concerned Canadian.
3078 2018-01-02 17:54:39 The Natural World Chia Seed Oil Volume and Shine Haircare Range!  sounds amazing would love a chance to try theses out I have such bad dry hair please count me in have F&rt
3079 2018-01-02 17:54:39 I sliced in half lengthways, scored it, rubbed with oil salt and pepper and baked for about 40 mins

I have also fried up some chunky onion and asparagus tips with a bit of cumin chilli and white wine vinegar
3080 2018-01-02 17:54:31 ...which brings immediately to my mind the eventual blockade of >15 MMMbbl/day of oil and gas exports from Strait of Hormuz, Gulf of Aden/Bab al Mandeb, and Suez in the event of a war with Israel.

3086 2018-01-02 17:54:00 After looking at my mileage since the last oil change was about 6,000, I figured today would be a good day to do that 
3087 2018-01-02 17:53:58 Is China still shipping oil to North Korea, sanctions?
3088 2018-01-02 17:53:53 1122/307 days to go.  The Lord has sent me to provide for those who mourn in Zion—to give them a garland instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit. Isaiah 61:3

3096 2018-01-02 17:53:20 Need to drive around until I get an oil change.
3097 2018-01-02 17:53:06 Oil cleanse method is a way of using CO and essential oils to wash the face and reduce oilness, dryness, and make the skin clear, soft, and less inflamed. It seems counterintuitive but using the oil prevents over drying AND prevents the skin from oroducing excess oil that causes
3098 2018-01-02 17:53:03 My skin is sooooo dry. What is a good lotion to use for moisturizing? Clearly my palmers cocoa butter + baby oil isn’t working anymore.
3099 2018-01-02 17:53:01 You pain me. But I am sure you have an oil that could help with that.
3100 2018-01-02 17:53:01 So it’s a heat burn? Cool it with ice, dress it and once the skin is not longer broken or blistered apply bio oil.
3101 2018-01-02 17:53:00 I don't get why people suffer with Fletcher and shitter fleets like my fleet only costs 13-20 oil! like yeah but you take like 2 minutes per battle so

3126 2018-01-02 17:50:44 made a budget, flossed, and put coconut oil in my hair all by the SECOND day of 2018! i am so healthy and responsible! nothing can fail me now!
3127 2018-01-02 17:50:38 Ugh, I hate it when that happens! I tried to calibrate the engine block and blew the head gasket. That’s what I get for alternating the alternator after changing the oil.
3128 2018-01-02 17:50:38 Car inspection place did my oil for free bless :,)
3129 2018-01-02 17:50:36 Thank you. Nah no paint. It's a wax/oil based modelling clay - that I've been buying because it's cheap - so it will never harden, and couldn't hold paint well, unfortunately. The next time I buy clay though, it will be something oven-bake-able so it can be painted.
3130 2018-01-02 17:50:34 you are entitled to your own opinion, that's fair. Only hope is the guys start putting it together. December was a pretty decent month, some great games/effort. they need consistency
3131 2018-01-02 17:50:25 My impression is you want a torts type of coaching.
3132 2018-01-02 17:50:13 Dear @Toyota, 

Whoever designed your oil filters should be fired immediately. 

Thanks,

3134 2018-01-02 17:50:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
3135 2018-01-02 17:49:56 Cutting off the Norks' oil supply won't stop their military ambitions. They can always put up windmills.

3142 2018-01-02 17:49:17 IT DOESN'T MATTER, IF IT IS DIRTY WHEN IT IS mixed  with the sands, later on it is as any other oil  around the world. The word dirty is not applicable  to the oil from Canada's provinces.and CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX .
3143 2018-01-02 17:49:16 They say cleansing oil
3144 2018-01-02 17:49:12 Great reminder! If men want a wife that does all these domestic chores, they should be ready to change the oil, mow the lawn, etc.

3150 2018-01-02 17:48:47 Makes a lot of sense for Turkey to partner with Iran: they have oil, can help counteract Kurdish rebels .. the two main Turkish vulnerabilities
3151 2018-01-02 17:48:41 There are still reasons for Hellas to defend Cyprus 
against Turkish aggresiveness and threats for oil and gas resources.
The companies involved may be foreign but are of allied countries.
So there is mutual interest in getting the drilling job done.
Besides there is tax revenue.
3152 2018-01-02 17:48:12 Agreed, just saying the idea that oil is not plant originated is reasonable. Truly the microbial part of our world is the most abundant and productive part of our planet.
3153 2018-01-02 17:48:09 Took my truck to the shop to get a oil change and fluids checked and they call me back about 18 other things that I can't afford right now. Fml

3156 2018-01-02 17:47:59 @josh_vilela remember how we believe water is not wet cause fire isn't burnt?

Well if corn vegetable oil comes from vegetables and olive oil comes from olives where does baby oil come from?
3157 2018-01-02 17:47:55 "ginkgo biloba, echinacea, fish oil and ephedrine are also under attack"

Goddamn big pharma not letting me buy my ephedrine so i could make my own organic meth!
3158 2018-01-02 17:47:54 I thought Venezuela’s economy collapsed due to the government’s decision to have the entire society subsidized by oil production and sales,(simplified) Do you or other Americans want to pay more at the pump?  Sounds like shortsightedness and poor leadership.What is your “vision”?

3169 2018-01-02 17:46:36 #outnumbered I personally think that China & Russia are using NOKO as a patsy to start a war with U.S. On the front face, they sanction & condemn. But on the backhand, we've seen the pictures of China oil tankers involved in helping NOKO. They won't start war outright, use NOKO

3180 2018-01-02 17:45:32 .@MoodysInvSvc: Oil prices will remain $40-$60/barrel this year despite OPEC's best efforts.
3181 2018-01-02 17:45:28 #Germany was under #Hitler very prosperous,but I"doubt" he was a good leader.Economic success,which,as in #SaudiArabia,is based solely on the fortune of oil reserves,has less to do with a good leader,but with luck.With this Oil even a penguin could be economically "successful"
3182 2018-01-02 17:45:27 I’m just going to say this one more time. If your coach doesn’t do everything and anything to win. It resonates with the players. Todd has done fuck all to change anything on that team without being forced to. If the coach doesn’t care then why would his players.

3188 2018-01-02 17:44:09 Amen and Amen! God has given me beauty for ashes an oil of gladness instead of mourning. Am still so expectant of the Lord

3206 2018-01-02 17:42:17 Remember Mark Thatcher, son of Margaret Thatcher, was caught funding a coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea (Africa's 3rd largest oil producer) in 2004. His punishment? A fine and four year suspended prison sentence.

3208 2018-01-02 17:42:14 i did, however, intubate and admit a young lady who had overdosed on pennyroyal-oil trying to induce abortion. i think she lived. oil of wintergreen kills many every yeas. essentially.

3213 2018-01-02 17:41:53 Why would companies sell refined avocado oil? The whole reason you eat avocados in the first place, for all the vitamins and minerals! Companies selling fake avocado oil trying to make a buck at the expense of the consumer.

3219 2018-01-02 17:41:33 Washed Kyras hair yesterday. Didn’t comb it, blow dry it, oil it or twist it. Now she’s ready to get her hair done & the shit is dry as ever. She might bawl when I comb this out.
3220 2018-01-02 17:41:26 It probably is.  You see that is why regulations that protect workers exist. Just wait till we all start drinking poisoned water, people die on oil rigs and in nursing homes.  I am all for deregulation but not at the cost of lives.

3227 2018-01-02 17:40:07 Of course public services in Norway are great! They have progressive taxation and saved all the tax from their oil and gas for the good if their people rather than fighting wars to make them look like an Empire!
3228 2018-01-02 17:40:07 my skin care routine is so off like i use lukewarm water to open my pores and then use foam cleanser and then toner and then tea tree oil and then bam! im done HAHAHHAHAA and actually im not really the consistent type so sometimes i only wash my face with foam cleanser

3232 2018-01-02 17:39:28 It took the 80’s Oilers losing before they learned to win. Playoffs are a different animal than the regular season my fear is not getting back there.
3233 2018-01-02 17:39:19 Then if anything grows, while you pose I'll oil you up and rub you down.

Y si no saben de lo que estoy hablando, no me dirigan la palabra
3234 2018-01-02 17:39:14 If you have a car would you intentionally put used oil in it? That's the same as getting nutrients from meat.

3269 2018-01-02 17:34:30 Our premier’s major complaint with the carbon tax is that it puts the onus on oil companies and farmers to pay. This plan does the same thing, it just doesnt do it with a tax.  This smacks of grandstanding by Mr Wall. It weakens his bs claim to be standing up for the people of Sk

3276 2018-01-02 17:34:00 Are they not selling that oil predominantly abroad and bringing the profits as foreign currency reserves into Norway?
3277 2018-01-02 17:33:51 My mom is getting her oil changed at valvoline and is finding all the workers on Facebook and stalking them.  Help

3283 2018-01-02 17:33:37 currently gettin the oil changed in my car and i’m sitting in the waiting area by the door. it’s cold and every time someone comes in, the door doesn’t shut. i have to shut the door. it’s freezing and i’m too impatient for this
3284 2018-01-02 17:33:29 Really don’t want to get up but I need to get an oil change before I go to work 
3285 2018-01-02 17:33:23 The Hubby couldn't figure out why I had a bowl of vegetable oil sitting on the table with me, but it's all too easy to glue one's fingers together when working with figures this small.  Dunk in oil right away and unstuck!  Reminds me of Madge and Palmolive; "you're soaking in it"
3286 2018-01-02 17:33:22 How come you never said anything against  & Putin for supplying them with oil! You are a Oligarch of Putin
3287 2018-01-02 17:33:21 Then you turnaround and go outside and the sun be BAKING you. Literally, with that OIL on your face.
3288 2018-01-02 17:33:14 Oil and gas are also from organic origins.
3289 2018-01-02 17:33:05 never was a burner, but I do enjoy my oil and edibles. I'm guessing his Dr is a sycophant like the rest of his administration. They'll give him a gold star health rating despite his mental/physical BLOAT.
3290 2018-01-02 17:33:01 Sauteeing your proteins and veggies first is crucial, but make sure to use a good amount of oil -- if stuff burns to the bottom, it can't reach pressure. ASK ME HOW I KNOW LOLOLOL.

3293 2018-01-02 17:32:40 lets be real, they still want to bomb iran, it's just now they're thinking how they can call it "supporting democracy" while taking the oil
3294 2018-01-02 17:32:39 No they wont. Lying Trump would have you believe that the snake oil he and GOP are selling will solve all your problems. The thing is Lying Donald wants a Wall to keep out everyone and wants you to pay for it, or he won't do anything at all with DACA
3295 2018-01-02 17:32:28 But muh Middle-Eastern country with oil money and heavy American/European investment. Muh  African country with Chinese-built infrastructure.
3296 2018-01-02 17:32:20 Sure is! He was quite glad when the infamous oil spill happened during Obama's presidency and he was busy golfing. Hell, Carter was the only person who was happy about the whole incident because he knew he was no longer the worst president of the United States!
3297 2018-01-02 17:32:03 Nothing that contains oil is not going on my face.
3298 2018-01-02 17:31:50 I can't believe I forgot to get some oil.

3304 2018-01-02 17:31:30 It's a predictable and shrinking clique of opinion-formers that you have to turn to if you take that route. 

Whale oil lamps made the world a brighter and more productive place for a time, but that doesn't imply it's sensible now. When something is clearly harmful, we move on.
3305 2018-01-02 17:31:29 Wait, I thought China was giving them oil. Kim talks to S. Korea because trying to talk to Agent Orange Man is a waste of time. Dotard.

3315 2018-01-02 17:30:30 What makes it worse is if a new Democratic Government of Iran is formed, watch them (World Govs) scramble to be first at their door to get oil deals etc. It’s pathetic that ordinary Iranian ppl are being persecuted whilst the world watches and says nothing, except Trump!
3316 2018-01-02 17:30:27 Hi, Sammy! Did you oil your blade before using? If a blade is pulling it is usually a sign it has not been oiled enough! You can also reach out to socialmedia@andisco.com for help! #Andis

3328 2018-01-02 17:28:53 Why isn't trump enforcing sanctions on Russia, especially since they're supplying North Korea with oil?! He only goes after China. Now why do you think that is? Open your eyes!
3329 2018-01-02 17:28:39 People Pray For Cake  But When The Almighty  Gives Them Eggs , Oil, Butter, Batter, A Pan , And An Oven They Get Frustrated And Leave The Kitchen. What’s The Point Of Asking For The Dream  If Your Unwilling To Do The Work. Either You Want It, Or You Don’t. 
3330 2018-01-02 17:28:24 Iran's crude oil production & exports have not been impacted by the unrest spreading across the country, Iranian oil & shipping sources said on Tuesday <a crackdown intensified against anti-government demonstrations that began last week #Oil #Iran #business #IranProtests
3331 2018-01-02 17:28:16 2. Regulations that were established after the BP oil disaster in the Gulf to guard against a repeat were eliminated.
3332 2018-01-02 17:28:16 @Darksaiyanis HAHA paper is my test of being done, I even use paper soaked in honing oil.
3333 2018-01-02 17:28:15 You preferred olive oil? 
3334 2018-01-02 17:28:04 Yea, Bernie; the Dems climbed in bed with Wall St, sold out to Big Oil & Big Pharma, & were paid off by Big Insurance to guarantee we never get Medicare-for-All. WHY CAN'T YOU GET ON BOARD??
3335 2018-01-02 17:28:04 I really hate the way this oil smells but it feels really good on my body.
3336 2018-01-02 17:28:03 Oil still needs time to warm up and fully lubricate your parts. 
Then there's the all necessary heat for inside the car so your windows don't fog up from your breath. 
Just saying
3337 2018-01-02 17:27:59 It's a crazy situation but a wonderful story.
3338 2018-01-02 17:27:42 better not to wash it...
oily hair will protect ur hair more than a clean one. But yeah maybe they will put coconut oil for protection instead .__. can't wait for ur new hair
3339 2018-01-02 17:27:36 It's what happens when you work in the oil industry doing my line of work.
3340 2018-01-02 17:27:33 #Kinnocchio alt facts. It’s growing by expanding existing plants instead of massive new projects. The mark of a maturing industry. And our oil sands are attracting Canadian ownership and Canadian investment. Keeping more profits in Canada.

3345 2018-01-02 17:26:47 "Accountability" is such a foolish notion. Accountable for what? To whom? Under what conditions? Does anyone honestly believe that these GMs / Coaches are only really trying because they fear losing their job? Please.

3351 2018-01-02 17:25:51 BINGO! Before he was even elected, I said this about money & oil in Russia!
3352 2018-01-02 17:25:25 Have you tried using coconut oil (CO)? We use it for our youngest. I love it b/c my skin is hypersensitive and my youngest is very dry. The CO is natural so safe to ingest, absorbs well while still creating a barrier to protect skin, and doesn’t deplete natural resources. :) 1/
3353 2018-01-02 17:25:11 Half? I was told we can ditch oil and stuff

3356 2018-01-02 17:25:05 I understand the benefit that travel and trade can bring but the downside is the destruction of nature, the enviornment and pollution that in turn causes great harm. China? Palm oil? Plastic   in our oceans? Personal gain by destruction of the planet is not in anyone's interest.
3357 2018-01-02 17:25:04 Problem is that the ditch have oil and Wales has WM.....yer, see the problem
3358 2018-01-02 17:24:58 From which area are you from is also decides good health
As for south indian cliamate coconut oil is good. Try to eat those oils which are from your region.
3359 2018-01-02 17:24:51 bought some crude oil puts today ... vol is low and sentiment is high ...
3360 2018-01-02 17:24:40 And we all know how that turned out ... now look at how his game has improved under McLellan.
3361 2018-01-02 17:24:39 Oil price rises to its highest level since 2015...
3362 2018-01-02 17:24:31 Baru and the oil junior high minister have lied to us. They have failed Buhari.  Buhari must sack them.
3363 2018-01-02 17:24:30 Coconut oil is all I use. It takes everything off. Like 6 layers of mascara, thick ass liner, all the things!
3364 2018-01-02 17:24:25 Puck nerve milks spheres of oil.
3365 2018-01-02 17:24:23 Hasn’t happened on any team McClellan has coached. If he had a history of getting the most out of his players I’d agree this is more on the players. But he has a history of underachieving. That’s where I stand.
3366 2018-01-02 17:24:20 so not just oil lobby funding denialism, likely Kremlin too.
3367 2018-01-02 17:24:19 Her family swear by two things, regardless of the complaint. If your leg was hanging off one of them would have a cup of hot water in one hand and some Saxa in the other, and someone else would be passing you a tissue soaked in enough Olbas Oil to burn the house down

3370 2018-01-02 17:24:13 So our plan is resilience? This appears to put the primary responsibility on farmers and oil companies. This is our plan? To tell farmers what and how to grow? To bring buildings up to code? Push more regulation on business? How much will this reduce CO2? No estimate here at all.
3371 2018-01-02 17:24:08 Never heard of them before! The oil from the wax is lovely on your skin!
3372 2018-01-02 17:24:06 In most cases I think too much is made of the coach needs to get the most out of his players angle. That's on the players but I do believe a coach can have a negative impact...as we saw we Eakins but I don't see that w/ McLellan.
3373 2018-01-02 17:23:52 Well maybe so but at least they have an oil fund and no foodbanks!
3374 2018-01-02 17:23:52 Will he also take credit for the next Mining Disaster or Oil Spill? This Tweet really sent me over the Edge. Even by 45 standards it’s ludicrous, ridiculous, and utterly irresponsible.

3384 2018-01-02 17:23:15 And the Oil rig where I work - I would wager 70-80% of those I work with are a hard Yes "next time" - lol - But I think you'll find that most rig workers were Yes back in the day - before the broad shoulders of the Treasury failed the 100K that were paid off.
3385 2018-01-02 17:23:08 Listen I was cooking eggs and the oil went to bite me and I thought it was the firework all over again so that’s how my day started
3386 2018-01-02 17:23:04 LOVE chilli oil!!!! 
3387 2018-01-02 17:22:53 #4. Leadership, for I think that the Oil are really missing a player like Matt Hendricks,  a grinder with heart, someone to seemingly step up during down times and keep things in check during good times.  Mark Letestu is level headed, but I don't see him as a vocal leader.
3388 2018-01-02 17:22:38 You do know that a player like RNH had 5 coaches in his first 4 years before they finally settled on McLellan, right?

3394 2018-01-02 17:22:06 I agree Rob. I have listened to a number of players talk about it (the tragedy) and a whole lot of fans. Seemed the Knights provided a level of hope and distraction for city that they needed at the time. ANd the players reached out and kept reaching out.

3401 2018-01-02 17:21:32 I'm sure that they are North Korea is doing it. They already seized 2 oil tankers going there in the past 2-3 weeks. So much for sanctions
3402 2018-01-02 17:21:26 Chinese caught red handed filling up North Korean tanker with oil in direct violation of UN sanctions. Trump letting Kim Jung un know he isn’t going to sit idly by letting them build a nuclear arsenal unlike his predecessors

3428 2018-01-02 17:19:06 makes economic sense. just let the oil float across the gulf instead of through underwater pipelines. it's like a free pipeline. I'm always looking for the (not-so) bright side.

3456 2018-01-02 17:16:25 I live in the US. I would say culturally Americans demand accountability in their sports teams more so than Canadians. Look at the rapidity of exiting coaches in the NFL. The Oilers have the best player in the NHL making the current situation untenable.

3458 2018-01-02 17:15:54 We are in total agreement that pre-1979 Iran was a nicer country than after. That’s not for discussion. What does need remembering is how they got there. Looking at the CIA & M15 involvement in regime change in Iran to get access to the oil pre1979 seems a logical starting point
3459 2018-01-02 17:15:52 ... the rest of the cleanse (drinking an unknown supplement, consuming 1L of olive oil, etc) is unnecessary
3460 2018-01-02 17:15:44 Pursue the enablers of national wealth laundering. There are western businessmen who work as conduits for those stealing their nations resources (oil) and "investing" it in property developments around the world.

3467 2018-01-02 17:15:14 On this day in 1882 the Standard Oil Trust was created.  Control of 40 different companies was transferred to the trust which was run by John D. Rockefeller.
3468 2018-01-02 17:15:14 Magic touch (it think that's the name) in Sanford.  Wash and oil change combo was great on my old car
3469 2018-01-02 17:15:08 Still the coach needs to get the most out of his players.
3470 2018-01-02 17:15:05 Woke up early, went to the gym & took my car to get an oil change .... who am I
3471 2018-01-02 17:15:03 ギルも強いらしいから良かったと思うよ
3472 2018-01-02 17:15:03 i saw that and of course Kass's penalties. I don't really care about that so much, it's loosing the puck battles, not initiating, circling and doing the loop instead of stopping and going hard the other way.
3473 2018-01-02 17:14:59 That's true short term, but oil is not a long term solution.
3474 2018-01-02 17:14:58 Too bad we want their oil.
3475 2018-01-02 17:14:51 What kind of oil is he spraying

3479 2018-01-02 17:14:46 Thanks for the reality check!  The Iranian mess started with the U.S. & U.K. led 1953 Iranian coup d'état to protect the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co control over Iranian Oil Reserves.  The democratically elected Iranian Gov't was overthrown & the last Shah of Iran was reinstated.
3480 2018-01-02 17:14:45 Keep the oil turned off and they will negotiate before they freeze to death.
3481 2018-01-02 17:14:39 But the players can’t change system, pp or pk.

3487 2018-01-02 17:14:09 I’m currently getting my oil changed and this middle aged woman sitting next to me is on the phone with her mom complaining about her roommate’s annoying habits and how she told him to go live somewhere else and “smoke weed till you die” lol

3491 2018-01-02 17:13:58 Our oil? Why can’t we pool & share with UK, they’re supporting us at present, then when your next oil boom comes, we share that with UK too? What’s wrong with that? We’re all the one country.
3492 2018-01-02 17:13:57 He was a terrible president. He knew nothing, exacerbated the oil crisis and his own party abandoned him. The hostages were released a day after he left office.

3521 2018-01-02 17:11:41 Vegas situation is one like we have never seen before. From the rallying with the community & forming an instant bond around tragedy, to having a roster that is void high-end talent but has better depth players than most. Also, belief is a powerful thing.
3522 2018-01-02 17:11:39 Beggars pour hot oil in to the eyes of their kids so that they can also beg. Similarly Pakis getting blind by their own way(breeding & training terror) so that their profession of begging gets an appeal(to cleanse terror again).A professional beggars nation from leader to terror.
3523 2018-01-02 17:11:22 In a vegan facebook group:
"Hey, I'm on Day 2 of Veganuary, is this gravy vegan? *posts photo*"

"err, well is the palm oil from a sustainable source? I doubt it"
"I would say stay away from things like this that are processed to shit."
"I dislike gravy products"

3533 2018-01-02 17:10:23 @RealPresidentT if you could regulate marijuana. Study show how open the genetic code is to schizophrenia. THC oil could help, but it has to be controled med. Doing it illegally will hurt our young kids. Please get scientist to study & place laws. God bless you and your family

3538 2018-01-02 17:09:45 plastics for instance: they can be made by oil (bad) which adds co2 and undestroyable gabage or we can use coppiced trees (good) to make bioplastics and sequester carbon

3549 2018-01-02 17:07:58 Watched Faux News (Fox)  for a minute (that's all I can take) just to see what they're talking about. Former CEO of oil company was talking about how there have been no incidents/accidents on the pipeline! People who watch Faux are REALLY gullible! @maddow
3550 2018-01-02 17:07:57 It's amazing ! Even Black Cumin Seeds (Kalonji ) oil is fab
3551 2018-01-02 17:07:55 Not entirely true. Deregulation & liberalization of the downstream sector won’t affect allocation of oil blocks which requires significant involvement of the president. Presidency will always be attractive as long as we have a very ‘strong centre’.
3552 2018-01-02 17:07:46 ‘... if the clan did not exact punishment for an offence against the great goddess, her wrath was loosed on all the land and not just on the offender. As the elders said, if one finger brought oil it soiled the others.’
3553 2018-01-02 17:07:43 And the US government supports such a regime. #SaudiArabia is evil & America shouldn’t take one drop of its oil.
3554 2018-01-02 17:07:25 Great start to the year! EPFC Corp has been awarded two new projects from a new client in the Montney! A 2,000 bpd oil battery with 20 MMscf/d of gas processing and a 1,500 bpd oil battery with 10 MMscf/d of gas processing. Both projects are design build. #Albertaoilandgas

3556 2018-01-02 17:07:22 Expensive Oil, Nuclear and coal vs clean inexpensive gas, PJM is in the middle of a new natural gas power buildout, dual fuel, low heat rate and capable of burning inexpensive Ethane. We can do much better in New England.

3559 2018-01-02 17:07:07 True, oil and gas are hydrocarbons. Coal is organic in origin.
3560 2018-01-02 17:06:46 Be careful you are surrounded by a body of jerks who are well compensated by Big Oil, Big Chem and Big Healthcare who think their greed is more important. Please, keep rolling! We are counting on you!

3565 2018-01-02 17:05:43 There is always an excuse for the oil industry to raise prices,Government don’t care because they receive more taxes
3566 2018-01-02 17:05:36 Do you have a Benz? I had a boss years ago that had a S class. He would pay $500 for an oil change every 5000.
3567 2018-01-02 17:05:29 Is that the players natural leadership or is that tuning out the coach and not careing. Why does someone like Gerard gallant get the most out of his players yet McClellan is at the bottom of the barrel. Don’t get me wrong the players need to wake up.

3584 2018-01-02 17:03:35 Read the article. @PowerPost completely misunderstands the current MAGA Populism. Mining, oil, and gas are good things for today's populists. They are called jobs. According to @HuffPost , fed workers make 50% than others.

Ummmm, the people who profit from dependence on foreign oil are those big ranchers with oil wells sitting on their land, because they keep them idle when oil prices are low,

3591 2018-01-02 17:03:05 and yet they can afford to invade Syria and arm the Houthis, those 777 000 000 barrels of oil they sold certainly went a long way last year......go figure.

3597 2018-01-02 17:02:25 President Trump has the whole world up in arms and I think it's great,Iran is worries about if they can hold on to control the country and N. Korea is just wanting to fight everyone and China is breaking International law by selling oil to N.Korea I love it.
3598 2018-01-02 17:02:19 because we believe that production is high. As soon as production looks low and prices go up), greedy oil producers start running those derricks.  Those people are Republicans and Trump supporters.  They are whom he is working for.

3618 2018-01-02 17:00:51 Good for you!!! I dumped a billionaire oil executive in Houston after a three-year Old World style courtship three days after the ring went on. He started trying to control me. I thought, "Oh, I know how THIS movie ends!" I am not for sale.

3624 2018-01-02 17:00:22 I did, one of my first oil landscapes in 2016 - it was awful. I'll find it
3625 2018-01-02 17:00:13 Iran’s hypocritical alliance w/India is most self destructive;hows it possible that u help India,ally of Israel,to create mischief in Pakistan+Afghanistan and expect no divine retribution;India’s gold for ur oil not worth it,if it req u 2participate in their crimes agnst humanity
3626 2018-01-02 17:00:09 Because, like, it’s all about oil, man! Mind, like, blown!?

3631 2018-01-02 16:59:56 "Brent and West Texas Intermediate oil prices will probably oscillate between $40 and $60 a barrel this year, penned in by rising U.S. shale production, declining but still hearty global supplies and eroding compliance with OPEC-led output cuts."

3659 2018-01-02 16:57:22 @INFINITIMotor Dont buy Infiniti. Technik (Apps) old or does not work. They charge for Oil nearly 300% more than Market price. Take a couple of € more and buy a real car

3661 2018-01-02 16:57:08 How many times has Trump said that America should just go into the Arab countries and TAKE THEIR OIL?

But, what if it isn't OIL but some OTHER VALUABLE MINERALS?

Are there any new geology reports regarding the mineral assets of  IRAN & AFGHANISTAN?

3666 2018-01-02 16:56:20 @AP @foxandfriends @Reuters @VP  curious @POTUS y you called out the Chinese  4 selling NK oil but when Russia does the same thing Silence?
3667 2018-01-02 16:55:52 ...or solar...or wind.  Oil doesn’t produce electricity, in any case...nuclear (dangerous and no place to dispose of dangerous waste), coal (just...filthy.  “Clean coal” is a lie.),
3668 2018-01-02 16:55:45 it's all very 'Mister Lumberjack's Beard Oil' isn't it?

3670 2018-01-02 16:55:31 How about the fact that the Russians have been secretly refueling/transferring oil NK at sea?

3671 2018-01-02 16:55:29 The USA and Russian oligarchs want it to melt. They want what hidden underneath all that ice. Our world economy is based on oil, gas and minerals.

But they don't, meaning they don't fully understand those struggles

3689 2018-01-02 16:52:58 Since July 4th oil prices are up almost 35% and in that time the speculator “net long” futures positions at the NYMEX have doubled. Contrast to 2008 when 70% move higher led to speculator “net short” positioning. Momo markets these days.

3703 2018-01-02 16:51:17 Iain do drop the Trump business. Do check facts re Iran which was socialist in the 1950s until the USA and UK had their President Mousandegqe assassinated and installed the puppet Shah - which led to the Ayotollahs. 'We' reap what we sow - for oil as usual. @LBC
3704 2018-01-02 16:51:09 Clergy rule despised for long time in Iran,but why now sudden outbreak of violence;bcz external elements chose this method after failing 2undo Iran nuclear deal+unable to turn western public opinion 4direct Iran war;Iran sells oil to China in CN¥,thats their crime agnst pharaohs
3705 2018-01-02 16:51:05 If only there were some non-carbon-emitting on-demand power source that was safer than other renewables and oil/gas. Man, that would be cool. Seems like maybe something could be done, or AM I JUST SPLITTING ATOMS HERE?

3710 2018-01-02 16:50:37 Natural beauty over anything. Fuck that makeup bs. A lot of females can't even put on makeup right anyway. Face be caked up looking like oil pastels but your face "beat"...... bitch no

3714 2018-01-02 16:50:24 i promise it'll work better if you use it with water based products instead of oil based ones. water and gel don't mix so gel and certain products won't mix well
3715 2018-01-02 16:50:23 Ok, I'm out of my depth on that point & haven't really researched it. But speaking more generally I do think that while Dems don't have officially codified racism in their platform (by my reckoning anyway) they do plenty to perpetuate. They support oil pipelines, imperialism etc

3720 2018-01-02 16:49:47 you know, if we play right, skate hard, follow the process,  limit mistakes/giveaways, I'm okay with a loss, what i find unacceptable is when the team "visually" doesn't show up, gets outworked, out hustled. I find that exacerbating .
3721 2018-01-02 16:49:42 Lots of treatment ! And keratin oil
3722 2018-01-02 16:49:30 Trump isn’t the only one delusional. Some things he is good at
1. Outlandish lies
2. Enriching self with taxpayer $
3. Taking credit for others’ accomplishments
4. Alienating allies
5.Emulating authoritarians 
6. Removing life-saving regs 
7. Giving public land to big oil

3727 2018-01-02 16:48:59 Totally agree with the concern about lack of interest in Canada (and throw the US in there too) AR, huge issue, however, I have to go with Mark on the Iran issue which is simply the current incantation of external globalist regime change efforts for power, control and oil.
3728 2018-01-02 16:48:52 Putin wanted sanctioms lifted in order for Rosatom to build reactors in the middle east, Rosneft and Gazprom to tap into undeveloped oil field reserves. This would have been worth several trillion $$$

Trump would've gotten a piece of real estate. Perhaps worth billions $

3736 2018-01-02 16:47:57 I’m, the only deep state would have economic interest in destroying the government. That would be, um, your pals the Koch brothers, um, the Russians, and, um the Saudis protecting trillions in oil. The government protects its citizens. So the infowars “deep state” wouldn’t be.
3737 2018-01-02 16:47:57 Oil marketers should rather be blamed for their wickedness
3738 2018-01-02 16:47:36 actually the website says don't us your own oil, so maybe don't
3739 2018-01-02 16:47:33 If I'm crying in a Benz, it's prolly cuz I just paid for an oil change
3740 2018-01-02 16:47:24 As cities provide lot of emplyment opportunities, many people migrate. Public transport needs to be encouraged, to reduce pollution and oil imports. Atleast for city buses,  it would be better if GST is removed.
3741 2018-01-02 16:47:20 The country of Germany is getting a taste something worse then the oil painter leader of WW2. The feminist fascist leafing them now down the road of annihilation. Goodbye Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner and culture worth saving.

3745 2018-01-02 16:46:47 Yep but we should be aiming for exports of processed products from tea to minerals. How refined or processed will the oil be once it starts being exported?
3746 2018-01-02 16:46:46 Donated some Olive Oil and Ouzo!!!

3748 2018-01-02 16:46:30 my my, baby whiner trump has been on a tweet rage this morning.  Unfortunately, there is  no way I can respect  a snake oil salesman who is running scared because he knows he is corrupt and divisive.  ugly .
3749 2018-01-02 16:46:27 Late 1800 and 1900 people made money in coal, steel and oil.  In 2000’s IT industry made Money.  Now it is POT’s turn.

Me: "Ah sure I'm no oil painting myself."

GF: "Wrong answer."

3761 2018-01-02 16:45:37 put some oil in my frying pan
3762 2018-01-02 16:45:32 Mr. President: Keep up with the pressure on North Korea. Perhaps a naval blockade will be necessary to prevent oil and other goods from getting into NK.
3763 2018-01-02 16:45:13 So no one in Alaska works? Got it. BTW, I already said I have no use for the rich. Oil pays them for raping their land. They don't get $ for nothing which is your proposal. I also have no use for lazy people in any income bracket. How do you make ends meet?

3779 2018-01-02 16:44:37 Oil prices looks like sustainable at $60 and heading higher.  PMs and BMs, other metals looks like they may go higher.  Yet many company's share prices haven't gone up well. Maybe when hot money comes out of BTCs and MMJs, SPs in resources will go up? Therefore get in now?
3780 2018-01-02 16:44:31 Have you told Putin to stop RU oil shipments to North Korea? Or are you still claiming that China is behind NK access to oil (a lie)? #resign #FakePOTUS
3781 2018-01-02 16:44:29 Can’t feel my toes but have too much anxiety to call the oil company
3782 2018-01-02 16:44:04 In a related news- South Korea advocating for North Korea to join the Olympics and china is selling oil to NK. The only thing that kept NK in check was counties uniting and sanctioning NK.But trump pulling funds from UN rendering it dysfunctional with his "America first" policy
3783 2018-01-02 16:43:54 Gold (Gold ) … Black Gold (Oil ) … Green Gold ( $CVGW )
3784 2018-01-02 16:43:51 end of the month when we dine suits me, happy for BTC to be in.. Fuck knows how wide we'll be off on that!!

could have a couple more like gold and oil too.. Too heavily weighted in FX if you ask me ;-)

3798 2018-01-02 16:42:31 @jasonfenske13 hi jason, i am one of your subscriber on youtube and i have a question. Does using original OEM oil filter be different from aftermarket? And which one do you prefer to use? Thanks

3801 2018-01-02 16:42:15 Reminiscing my 1st oil painting
3802 2018-01-02 16:42:12 Great! My Family has 700 acres of land on coastal L.a.  We've had oil companies drill and ravage the land.  I would love to erect a wind farm and feed ele to the co-op ENG CO. Plus lots of skilled workers from oil fields

Still managed to get us tax cuts, repealed 1000's of job killing regulations, open up oil fracking, bringing back manufacturing jobs, canceled TPP, ended the individual mandate & much much more!

3811 2018-01-02 16:40:54 Venezuela is a capitalist country with socialist government riddled with corruption and over-reliant on oil exports. Bolivia also has a socialist government and is doing much better as a result. But we don't hear about that

First a foolish us president start war to help protesters in iraq then steal their oil in return.
Second foolish started war in Afghanistan because of a video announcement of their own media production & still try to convince we won

3826 2018-01-02 16:39:43 I don't believe they are blunders, they don't care what state they leave a country as long as they can pilfer their oil !
3827 2018-01-02 16:39:27 Why can't you partner with existing oil marketing companies to install a charging station?? I'm not able to understand, why vehicle manufacturers can't think through this? Tesla also did not have the infrastructure when it started
3828 2018-01-02 16:39:25 sorry Nate, I missed the "one of" part...
3829 2018-01-02 16:39:14 Oil is reused in case of store bought. As far as i am aware.. thats why it stays on the product too
3830 2018-01-02 16:39:11 *says sorry more times than the BP Oil Company*

I am sorry

I am sorry

I am sorry

3831 2018-01-02 16:38:53 Ooh green grass knoll spread eagle wide grass  oil from atop
3832 2018-01-02 16:38:49 100%
I suspect it’s a part of some elaborate information campaign (goes together w recent press about illegal oil transfers from China, Russia, Panama)
It’s obvious that WH knew about all of those 5min after it happened and been mute on it
Now through friendly reporting we know
3833 2018-01-02 16:38:48 You know it wouldn’t do the Oil a world of hurt to sit a few guys a game or two.
3834 2018-01-02 16:38:48 Yes my thoughts exactly
3835 2018-01-02 16:38:35 NNPCs current setup does not operate like a commercial entity that is profit driven. That is essence of the PIB. To make NNPC commercially viable like other state owned oil companies like Statoil of Norway and other profitable NOCs

3839 2018-01-02 16:38:05 A bitch that’s still ‘greasing her scalp’ with blue fucking magic should never have the balls to say who or what looks classless and ratchet. You leave an oil sick wherever you lay your head. Niggas hate giving you rides cuz your hair breaks the leather
3840 2018-01-02 16:38:05 Oh yes, capitalism that promotes the slave trade, child workers, sweatshops and oil spills.
3841 2018-01-02 16:38:01 You know what helps limit domestic airline accidents?

3850 2018-01-02 16:37:33 My least favorite thing about having a car is getting my oil changed alone bc i never know what they are talking about
3851 2018-01-02 16:37:29 You are absolutely correct, pot is a negative and causes damage. I have witnessed it turn people violent as well. Any possible medicinal value is in the oil that can be synthetically produced. No reason to smoke pot@IngrahamAngle
3852 2018-01-02 16:37:26 Does anyone else see a national security issue when Venezuela will have a pre-mined ICOd coin without borders affecting the price of US BTC futures?  Backed by an oil field?  If it goes under can I live on a piece of the oil field?
3853 2018-01-02 16:37:26 "And I say that as a former risk manager for both aviation and energy." wow - then its pretty cool to have you.

what would u say: is it good to compare oil & gas to other industries in terms of safety culture? or is it not that simple bc of the unique risks of O&G explorition?
3854 2018-01-02 16:37:12 Nai.. we made in oil only
3855 2018-01-02 16:37:06 Yes you (RaGa) can only put oil in the fire in name of BJP and RSS for your political gains.
3856 2018-01-02 16:37:03 BP=Horrible Company, remember gulf coast oil spill!  Executives are greedy, piggish, corrupt.  do not buy their gas
3857 2018-01-02 16:36:59 If there is only 1 oil for your bath to meditate to and completely switch off then it's @Elemis Frangipani monoi body oil. The most beautiful, luxurious oil of exotic islands transporting you to a world of heaven and serenity. Am panicking as running out!! Buy it now!!
3858 2018-01-02 16:36:59 Oil is the only thing we an use on exterior jobs round hear, being on the coast things take quite a beating.
3859 2018-01-02 16:36:43 Na bro.. we have a cook.. 
Its a big oil tanker..
3860 2018-01-02 16:36:40 Our oil ran out of our furnace so I'm bundled up on the couch. So far I've watched: Meet the Robinsons and Camp Rock 1 & 2. It's not even noon yet.
3861 2018-01-02 16:36:40 Storebought is fried in oil.. we at home fry it in ghee.
3862 2018-01-02 16:36:39 Tried to no Vaseline me real good I said nah eye am good I’ll just use y’all for oil changes and that’s it. Y’all niggas trippin lol
3863 2018-01-02 16:36:37 remi just looks at freyr like you dumb fk and just changes the topic 
freyr just stands there having an existential crisis trying to figuer out the real meaning behind the truffle oil and cucumber
3864 2018-01-02 16:36:36 too much consumed olive oil
3865 2018-01-02 16:36:31 I love a good scalp treatment and my scalp gets very dry. I use the mint oil my Auntie makes it a liquid oil and massage it in with my Vanity Planet scalp massager
3866 2018-01-02 16:36:25 Subsidy has never been a fixed thing. There may be no subsidy today but subsidy tomorrow because oil prices and exchange rates (mainly) keep changing.
3867 2018-01-02 16:36:16 So deep. Chevron has found a new oil source there.
3868 2018-01-02 16:36:03 This was all staged between Trump and the Prince of Saudi. Trump owes him billions and now it's payback time. Saudi wants a civil war in Iran so they can't compete with oil sales and that's why Jared  has flown to Saudi for the past several weekends. It's nothing to do with Obama
3869 2018-01-02 16:36:01 I'm a big fan of using the oil sands to bolster our public services, frankly. No nation would keep that much energy in the ground. We also have to accept... and this is hard for the left... we can't afford to do everything for everybody. We don't even want that.
3870 2018-01-02 16:35:59 Everyone's dropping BTC because it's not a currency. It's a "store of value" aka "digital gold" aka "digital snake oil."
3871 2018-01-02 16:35:54 A little snow never gets in the way of a good oil change! 
3872 2018-01-02 16:35:49 So not only is my power steering toast and a cylinder dead, it turns out my radiator reservoir is black with oil, which can only mean one thing: busted head gasket.  Somehow I have to get to the doctor tomorrow, so wish me luck that the car makes the 4 mile round trip.
3873 2018-01-02 16:35:46 Kailangan nang lagyan ng oil ang keyboard.

3876 2018-01-02 16:35:25 Hopefully this oil change don’t take too long. I am not tryna be outside forever
3877 2018-01-02 16:35:17 Oil change coming soon
3878 2018-01-02 16:35:03 へにゃーーー！！！まごもいるーーー！！！！！！！きゃわたん…お年玉あげようね…おじいちゃんめっちゃあげちゃう…
3879 2018-01-02 16:34:36 In addition, peak oil will come because demand goes away, not because of supply constraints. As you point out, we are not practically constrained by availability of oil, given all the conventional, light tight oil, and heavy oil that exist.
3880 2018-01-02 16:34:22 The intake manifold had a mixture of oil and coolant on top of it. Fingers crossed this doesn't end up costing a fortune for me :s
3881 2018-01-02 16:34:15 Later I'm about to go get an oil change

3907 2018-01-02 16:31:32 Winter has me wondering if anyone has ever used those full-body fetish suits to do some hardcore moisturizing. Just fill that thing up with coconut oil and hang out for a few hours.
3908 2018-01-02 16:31:29 Best thing about living in Singapore is that you can take the best things from the different races, so herbs from the Chinese, coconut oil from the Indians, and what from the Malays? Probably jamu, and big families.
3909 2018-01-02 16:31:14 What it breaks down too is that republicans have their money invested in non renewable energy such as coal, oil, etc and libs have their money invested in renewable energy which is why libs will say anything they can about how bad non renewable is. It's about money not the earth.

3930 2018-01-02 16:28:51 They should just be honest and call it what it is, a regressive tax. And now with World oil prices increasing, guess who will be hit even harder.

3944 2018-01-02 16:27:56 I've been using OGX shampo/conditioner. They have one with Orchid Oil that is awesome for my hair and it smells good. They also make the apple which smells awesome, but the conditioner isn't good enough for long term use. Worth the money.

3992 2018-01-02 16:22:28 How are those Russian sanctions coming along since it was Russia that was supplying the oil to NK?

4002 2018-01-02 16:21:21 Really? Where does oil come from - outer space?
4003 2018-01-02 16:21:20 Yes, back then we could never think oil prices would crash. In fact every analyst was talking about oil at $200. A doomsday scenario was being painted. How times have changed?
4004 2018-01-02 16:21:04 I swear you taxi guys if you honk at me 0.000256 seconds after the light turns green, I'll put gear in P, adjust my seat, check my tyre pressure, change my oil, retweet this, cue up a rolex, read a book, brush my teeth, nap, do Lego, and play snake on Nokia 3310.
4005 2018-01-02 16:20:59 Clearly - I was (name doesn't need mentioning) blocked randomly by more than a few people - and still don't know why. I assume it's because I refuse to put up with their BS snake oil sales pitches.
4006 2018-01-02 16:20:47 Again - oil is indispensable to our society. Wind turbines are a disaster, and a useless one for that matter.

4018 2018-01-02 16:19:47 I wish you would talk about why.. the popcorn to the left is made with oil. The popcorn to the rice is made without oil. 

Basically the left is the popcorn you buy in a bag and the right is popcorn you have to make & butter yourself. There’s YouTube vids on how to make it.

4024 2018-01-02 16:19:10 Good lord, how can anyone be so stupid, and believe that the rest of us are even more so. Put away the snake oil, #BenedictDonald - we're not buying it.
4025 2018-01-02 16:19:06 my Camry will run for another 5 years though fam just gotta do oil change. Maryland just be fukin taxing the fuk outta me
4026 2018-01-02 16:19:04 Some people are just bad with directions. My wife still freaks out when I ask her to meet me someplace downtown. We've lived in Indy since 2007. Seems hard to miss Lucas Oil Stadium though.

4030 2018-01-02 16:18:48 i would add that these are the numbers the oil industry is not even dreaming of. 
4031 2018-01-02 16:18:38 That is true as well. I have always thought they needed 1-2 more experienced guys. They had them. This is what scares me. They don’t seem to understand the need for experience. And Todd doesn’t like playing rookies.

4040 2018-01-02 16:17:21 Thanks, I will change the oil in my snowblower  !  
4041 2018-01-02 16:17:17 That is total nonsense. You can't generalize like that. Arab regimes have selfish interests like every state does. Of course they're influenced by their oil deals with the West, but some defy them and commit horrors anyway.
4042 2018-01-02 16:17:15 This is an excellent move. I was in Uganda for 7 yrs but i was never in line to buy fuel and they are not producing oil. The challenges could be as a result of abusing the management of the system and those responsible are hardly brought to book.

Ask me any questions about hydrocarbons .

4048 2018-01-02 16:16:47 2018 Got me feeling like a car with a fresh oil change and tune up.
4049 2018-01-02 16:16:46 45 when reporters report without bias and tell the truth, you don’t like it if it does not meet the agenda you and Putin are using to enrich yourselves. It is NOT fake news that you have been trying to lift sanctions against your buddy. Follow $/oil.
4050 2018-01-02 16:16:44 I follow you. I agree with you on so many things. On oil though, the way to cause those here in CA pain is by refusing to allow exports. CA is awash in oil, and exports refined products to inflate the price of gasoline

4060 2018-01-02 16:15:22 It’s all part of the con it keeps the faithful committed. Facts don’t matter to those folks and a snake oil salesman only need maintain the small percentage of reliable suckers to keep the con running.

4062 2018-01-02 16:14:54 Seems @Iran religious leaders take most of the oil profits for themselves , giving none to public, creating no jobs. People need to remove the guard, religious leaders and start over. @ReutersIran
4063 2018-01-02 16:14:48 I used to work at Esso's Cold Lake Oil Sands project. (The one that injects steam, not strip mining.)

Minimal impact. Beautiful

4080 2018-01-02 16:13:31 The price fell because of oversupply.
The US is less reliant on oil imports because of locally produced cheap shale gas and oil.
There's a lesson there somewhere.

4087 2018-01-02 16:12:44 2. If oil is your only asset, limiting its sale, is a very limited option, in fact less prolific oil producers have MORE leeway for extortion; this is why Saudi was involved in OPEC, could not afford to go it alone; realiteeeey!

4095 2018-01-02 16:12:02 The price fell due to the attempt to damage Russia remember. We were discussing oil price & extraction. It was tweeted by oil investor. You think I want a war? Why did Indy 2014 make you lot turn so childish? 
4096 2018-01-02 16:11:59 Examples are bad. Growth of UAE is based on oil and gas and has nothing w/institutions or policies. HK is an entrepot city-state which similarly has no replicable value. S'pore is a better example, but it not an inequiality heaven; redistribution and govt are v important.

We created the UKs first Avocado Oil mayo and produce the finest Extra Virgin Avocado Oil... both launched 10 weeks ago.

Launched as we both personally transformed our health through eating REAL FOOD yet realised there was a lack of products that would help us!

4104 2018-01-02 16:11:31 Why are you not saying anything about Russia providing North Korea with oil? Why are you not enforcing sanctions against Russia? Oh yeah your buddy Putin tick tock
4105 2018-01-02 16:11:28 Makes you look like an ass since you literally just made it better for those who get gold plated pensions. There are lots of subsidies to all types of business like oil which put into question the risks entrepreneurs take & bankruptcy for those that fail letting them try again.
4106 2018-01-02 16:11:15 Seiderman was a makeup and artistic genius.  Also an inventor (the Waring blender).  In his retirement years, he did tiny oil paintings using a single cat's whisker for his brush.

4131 2018-01-02 16:08:46 Keto tip#5
Healthy Fats

Oils: MCT,Coconut,avocado, and olive. Nothing hydrogenated and stay clear of seed oil

Animal: rendered fat from sources like bacon, marrow bones,etc. can be filtered and refrigerated for later use. 

Nuts and seeds should be limited to a serving a day

4134 2018-01-02 16:08:31 I did. The only other van needed an oil change and would have taken even longer. I have never had an experience like this renting a car before, which is something I do quite often.

4136 2018-01-02 16:08:01 I wonder the same. For a lot of other things too. I think its the quality of ingredients. Especially oil.

4138 2018-01-02 16:07:57 I'm guessing that they just haven't kicked in yet. For example, maybe airplanes used to have to have "an oil change" every 1,000 miles but now it's 10,000? The crashes will come as the regulation changes sink in.

1) Saudi is fairing about as well as Israel and the USA have against similar opponents.
2) Oil protects of your nation can actually control oil prices worldwide 
3) And if you use the profits to buy a huge, modern military
4149 2018-01-02 16:06:42 Yeah, but in the 1990’s the dollar didn’t matter to oil. The fundamentals always outweigh the FX

4152 2018-01-02 16:06:10 canola is rape, or leaf cabbage... we have made the oil plant have less flavour, but it’s a delicious green, as well as a useful seed. olive oil is only good if you don’t burn it...

4155 2018-01-02 16:05:48 Olive oil, not extra virgin. Olive oil has no health benefits to begin w/. Danger w/ EVOO is cooking a LONG time under high heat — a normal cook in an average kitchen would not do.
4156 2018-01-02 16:05:39 My guess is #Trump #Pakistan rant is actually targeted at #India, which is not going to be thrilled to see instability in #Islamabad rival #Iran, which is the largest oil supplier to India.

4163 2018-01-02 16:04:34 What planet on you on? Business is booming, more money in our pockets, extremely low unemployment, oil independence, ISIS defeated, MS13 on way out. Are you nuts? Or just a paid troll? Get A JOB! Be happy! Succeed! Stop believing lies. Smh
4164 2018-01-02 16:04:17 There are still a few people overplaying it, plus the snake oil vendors and other security theater con-men.

Those bad apples mean that muggles often can't figure out whether the security hole is real or just plain theoretical.
4165 2018-01-02 16:03:51 Yes it is, so what point were you making about Iraq and Afghanistan then? America got "outfoxed", but Israel struggled with "non-state guerilla warfare. Oil protects, unless you are on a Neocon hit list; double standard tsunami time.

4168 2018-01-02 16:03:35 Trump just signed a deal with Saudi Arabia. A Country, wich is supporting radical Islam. Pakistan is much more moderate than Saudi-Arabia. But i know, Saudi-Arabia has more oil
4169 2018-01-02 16:03:30 Add a protein treatment weekly, and an overnight oil treatment (even just plain ol’ coconut oil) when you can. Makes a huge difference. Also get a wet brush like a tangle teaser, super gentle on bleached hair.
4170 2018-01-02 16:03:29 Great point.  Can probably apply that to all markets, not just oil.

4191 2018-01-02 16:01:48 This is all happening because you owe the Saudi Prince billions and he wants a civil war in Iran so they can't compete with oil sales. That's why Jared was in Saudi for several weekends. You conspired with Saudi to make this happen, has nothing to do with Obama you crook

4200 2018-01-02 16:00:35 Yeah this way he doesnt have to address his overlord Putin selling oil to North Korea.

But he better do what he thinks he can do soon. Mueller has him dead to rights

4299 2018-01-02 15:50:49 Let KSA try to pull shit like that in the era of fracking and see how well it works out for them.

4303 2018-01-02 15:50:34 I'm actually surprised more conservatives (non talking heads) in the south ain't starting to fume over prices. Guess they don't have someone they trust in the pulpit raising hell over rising oil prices.

4309 2018-01-02 15:49:36 That sucks so hard! On top of everything my heating oil company is running behind schedule, so the delivery we scheduled for last week still hasn’t come. Here’s to hoping I don’t run out of oil before they come

4330 2018-01-02 15:46:40 The problem with your logic is that these monuments are from people who have, since the beginning of this country be pushed around, killed and abused. Your monuments are the abusers themselves. Besides no one was proposing drilling for oil beneath the Robert E Lee statue.
4331 2018-01-02 15:46:40 My dad is going to kill me when he finds out there’s water in the oil thingy of my car.   I couldn’t even sell the story of a hump that made the bumper come off.
4332 2018-01-02 15:46:34 Someone asked me what fundation I was using and I was ready to give them a 5000 wrd essay in the benefits  of vitamin e oil.

4339 2018-01-02 15:46:10 Minecraft makes more in a week than the oil industry makes in a year. As I’ve said, technology is changing exponentially, industry as you know it will change rapidly. The digital world means you don’t have to a big country to succeed. You need to move forward not stand still.
4340 2018-01-02 15:46:03 he will do that with anyone he can do real estate with? i knew immediately there was a trump tower moscow planned; more alarming; is rex tillerson exxon as sec of state; that is there to deliver drilling to putin and russian oil and whack up profits with american oil interests
4341 2018-01-02 15:45:58 Yeah. Because of its oil reserves, not because of Zionists. Saudi's shift towards warmer relations with Israel only happened in the past couple of years.

4348 2018-01-02 15:45:16 There’s a product called Goo-Gone, if you can’t get that use veg oil.
4349 2018-01-02 15:44:57 All the uptick in drilling means we need more oil and reserves, which likely means being prepared for a war.cant depend on importing oil in times of conflict...or leaving $'s in other countries economies..i.e. tax bills. Common sense presumes a real war is likely possible.

4359 2018-01-02 15:43:58 Again oil is more disastrous to health of planet and still a huge difference between 1,000 L used and 800,000 L spilled from one spill. That 1,000 L could be replaced with planet friendly vegetable based oil too.
4360 2018-01-02 15:43:43 Or would you like to address the fact they were dependent on oil investments? Surprisingly capitalistic.

4384 2018-01-02 15:41:13 NNPC operates at a loss for 2 reasons
1. They are cost driven not profit driven. This is evident in their oil exploration expenditures and in the refinery operations. 
2. Politics get in the way of the real business to be done.
The PIB in its entirety is aimed at addressing these

4446 2018-01-02 15:33:57 When in doubt: coconut oil
4447 2018-01-02 15:33:45 Since you are all about hair growth,  I recommend peppermint oil first and foremost. About the stiffness of your hair, it's probably because you have high porosity hair. Try conditioning frequently using a leave-in-conditioner and then follow with coconut oil as a sealant.
4448 2018-01-02 15:33:41 You're right he should be working for a tobbaco or oil company. Maybe a slum landlord or have a company that rips off the NHS. God knows a series off lectures is totally morally corupt
4449 2018-01-02 15:33:40 If you experience cravings when you smell certain foods, try placing a small amount of peppermint essential oil on your shirt collar
4450 2018-01-02 15:33:39 I am sure the buddy Soros is involved in one way or another. Anywhere US interests lie protests start then war follows. Well at least anywhere where oil, gold is and central bank without control. People are watching, another president another war?

4458 2018-01-02 15:33:30 Let’s hear your comments about Russian tankers offloading oil to North Korean ships. You condemned China. You do know there’s a Russian collision investigation going on and you’re not helping yourself. #ImpeachTrump

4464 2018-01-02 15:33:02 Interesting to see crude oil unable to go up on the Iran news.   Or maybe there just isn't much dumb money anymore.

4472 2018-01-02 15:31:25 Agreed.  Plus, the CIA facilitated a coup in Iran in 1953 that installed the Shah who then allowed US oil companies access.  We don't have a good history in that country.

4494 2018-01-02 15:29:47 Add  gingelly oil , too , the original ell- neyy , from which the very word ennai (oil) originated ? 

In my native Kerala , it’s called nalla-enna, the good oil !
4495 2018-01-02 15:29:45 Use coconut oil or baby oil. They work just as good if not better.

4503 2018-01-02 15:28:41 I've been bullish on oil prices and certain O&G stocks for a long time (I started too early). But you can't make the same case for higher crude prices from here that you could even a few months ago. $60-65 probably is in fact high enough to drive at least some re-investment.
4504 2018-01-02 15:28:10 Today in 2008 oil prices soar to $100 a barrel for the first time
4505 2018-01-02 15:28:01 @RobisonEnergy1  I pray my oil delivery comes soon.. it’s terribly cold and I have sick child. #dontwanttocallagain
4506 2018-01-02 15:27:58 Fats usually don't cause an insulin spoke because they are absorbed much later.  Not true for MCT oil.  Gets absorbed through the portal vein, and since MCFAs can cross cell membranes, they can enter the beta cells, get metabolized for ATP, and cause released insulin 2/2
4507 2018-01-02 15:27:57 Utk any skin condition or problem pon, moisturizer sangat penting ! Jangan pernah tinggal  Texture moisturizer tuh yang kene sesuai kan dengan kulit.

4548 2018-01-02 15:22:40 AND the always-reliable @DeanBaker13 points out that the investment growth a) is not especially rapid b) is concentrated in the mining & oil sectors and c) is probably mostly a result in global rise in oil prices.

4593 2018-01-02 15:16:59 Let me try this coconut oil thing
4594 2018-01-02 15:16:54 You’ll notice these changes as they get older. It’s part of aging. I’ve been watching those little things for years with our parents and now my kids are starting to see stuff with us. Weird cycle.
4595 2018-01-02 15:16:50 Hope you didn't bring Murphy's Oil Soap. That stuff stinks!

4597 2018-01-02 15:16:47 黒くなって貰わなきゃ
4598 2018-01-02 15:16:46 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
4599 2018-01-02 15:16:44 ROAST EVERYTHING! Take any frozen veg, boil for a bit, then put in tray with oil (butter if not vegan) salt, lazy garlic and/or chopped red onion, nuts and seeds of choice, maybe chilli, maybe marmite, parmesan if not vegan.
4600 2018-01-02 15:16:43 Discussion over dinner was skincare, carrier oils and essential oils. Hung out with a friend who makes her own oil blends. I told her to make one for me!
4601 2018-01-02 15:16:43 What fats you having? Would recommend some coconut oil in there if possible. If you have a blender I’ve just discovered spinach, frozen banana, blueberries, cucumber and a bit of honey makes a decent smoothie - could probably take the honey out and it still be fine
4602 2018-01-02 15:16:40 Starting this new year by doing a coconut oil treatment on my hair. 
4603 2018-01-02 15:16:26 Oil short view?
4604 2018-01-02 15:16:19 Thanks for the explanation and the heads up about my user name. New to Twitter so didn’t realize, will have to update.
4605 2018-01-02 15:16:18 Um....North Korea has talked to South Korea many times before. What about the Russian ship giving North Korea oil? Wasn't China adter all.......
4606 2018-01-02 15:16:17 Started oil cleansing my face, we’ll see how this goes

4609 2018-01-02 15:15:49 هههههههه
4610 2018-01-02 15:15:40 Russians are giving them oil.
4611 2018-01-02 15:15:37 Is the US watching so that it can pick the right time to invade and take over in order to pilfer the oil?
4612 2018-01-02 15:15:36 何かとは明言しませんがもうくっそ書きまくったのでもうういいです
4613 2018-01-02 15:15:33 Them: What are you mixed with?

4614 2018-01-02 15:15:10 @msnbc WALL ST. TRAITORS in bed w/VIRTU PARTNERS of YUGO. have stolen $6 trillion worldwide creating 1000's of BILLIONAIRES. Why do they have to play in USA at OUR CCM taking up gas/heating oil products? Do they really need the money that much?
4615 2018-01-02 15:14:55 キャスタージルドレェを旦那と呼ぶ理由、なんやかんやで「旦那」っていう２文字に「(雨生龍之介と四次を駆け抜けて神様問答して目から鱗ぽろりして大海魔召喚して幸せに消滅したあの)キャスターのジルドレェ」っていうピンポイントな指定情報を簡単に込められるというのが大きい
4616 2018-01-02 15:14:48 How about denouncing your boss Putin for continuing to sell N Korea oil despite the sanctions?
4617 2018-01-02 15:14:41 Lesson learned from day 1 of 2018:
When you're drunk in a hottub & decide to get out to make something to eat, put a shirt on before using the stove.
I've now got a lovely big blister on my chest from where the hot oil splattered me...

4621 2018-01-02 15:14:27 #2018Prediction one of the revelations that come out through the muller investigations court files is an explanation of why Steve Bannon wears a collared shirt on a collared shirt. The first shirt becomes translucent because of grease and oil requiring the second one.

4630 2018-01-02 15:14:04 China still did banking with NoKo and was "caught" trading oil. Russia still deals with NoKo. NoKo wants to be in Olympics next month. That is the ONLY reason talks may materialize. Trump will take credit.
4631 2018-01-02 15:14:03 Do proper research listen to climatologists NOT mere TV weather men. And certainly not those funded by oil companies.
4632 2018-01-02 15:13:57 REMINDER!!! Trump still refuses to denounce Russia for smuggling oil to North Korea.

4634 2018-01-02 15:13:50 The e istence of oil isn’t the issue. It’s the cost of extracting it that counts. Didn’t you know that?
4635 2018-01-02 15:13:50 What is oil pasta, taehyungssi?

4637 2018-01-02 15:13:39 What about the oil that Russia sent to North Korea? You called out China but not Russia. I wonder why?
4638 2018-01-02 15:13:33 To everyone taking care of kids with runny nose/ and or cough or if you’re sick, oil of oregano and Vick’s vapor rub put on the bottom of the feet followed by socks helps soooo much.
4639 2018-01-02 15:13:24 Russia selling them oil, China selling them oil????? Is it working???? We need a Naval blockade around North Korea, “stop or be sunk”
4640 2018-01-02 15:13:24 Things that were once easy seem insurmountable. Changing a light bulb becomes a day's work...

Please someone bring some volatility into that pos
4651 2018-01-02 15:12:53 Still not calling out Russia for violating the sanctions by selling NoKo oil huh?
Well, at least you are predictable.
4652 2018-01-02 15:12:53 My mental picture was of used dirty oil. Lol
4653 2018-01-02 15:12:43 Banks do that now .... ripple is snake oil

4666 2018-01-02 15:11:05 10 hours later and you still can't tell me who other than China ships oil to N. Korea. Another question then: How do you rate your own reading comprehension?

4676 2018-01-02 15:09:45 Sounds good to great as long as it’s done with the least harm to the environment. I irrationally feel very sad/angry re. ANY disruption to a fallow area. Oh well. (Btw, I have used CBD oil.)

4685 2018-01-02 15:08:52 In one way or another, either by getting cheaper oil or something in return. Why otherwise would people just start calling something arabian gulf after it always being called persian gulf? What is the reason?
4686 2018-01-02 15:08:46 Ohhhh. Try an oil you'd eat. Grapeseed or safflower. Even a few drops mixed in your lotion helps. A little goes a long way.

4692 2018-01-02 15:07:53 Oh yeah Marula is a nice, light oil
4693 2018-01-02 15:07:43 This is a problem with some Nigerians. We sit in our houses eating cocoyam and oil, then we ask for data to be placed on our laps. Go and do your research, check NNPC, NBS, FAAC, NEITI, Min. Of Finance etc websites. Sit up and do your part.
4694 2018-01-02 15:07:41 yeah that might work. Honestly I think it’s overthinking a pretty easy fold though. Hot oil + Frank’s + butter. Tada!
4695 2018-01-02 15:07:40 my oil bill this month was $500. if any deep web assassins need to like hone their skills fuckin come through

4700 2018-01-02 15:07:02 Reducing imports of coal, oil & gas would improve air quality. Reducing costs on health service of lung diseases. Taxation would reduce over time, so would the need for certain types of spend.
4701 2018-01-02 15:07:00 Dialogue is dependent on US South Korean military exercises being scaled-down and the Russians and Chinese are smuggling oil to North Korea.
Yeah, it's all going bigly well.
4702 2018-01-02 15:06:56 No, it’s not. The US doesn’t need Syrian oil. We have more than the Saudi’s.
4703 2018-01-02 15:06:51 Ya driving a vehicle with thick oil is so much better ya dunce
4704 2018-01-02 15:06:43 Anyone got a garage I could change my oil in??
4705 2018-01-02 15:06:38 Put some oil in between them
4706 2018-01-02 15:06:26 I have before but not currently, i used Marula oil in the summer. I liked it a lot.
4707 2018-01-02 15:06:21 The EU is not a nation, it is not communist nor does it rely on its internal gas and oil supply to stay afloat so not sure why you would compare the two?

EU parliament is democratically elected, so the accountability holds in practice.
4708 2018-01-02 15:06:21 They can blame for sanctions but not the children who die. People suffer from corruption and injustice. Blaming sanctions is like blaming the antibiotics. Islamic government is an infection. A cancer metastasing the whole world, if not stopped. Oil is the main artery!
4709 2018-01-02 15:06:21 THANK YOU! If I have to explain to one more person why coconut oil is for FOOD and NOT your face, I was going to scream 
4710 2018-01-02 15:06:14 Weird how he doesn't mention Russia supplying N.Korea with oil, breaking sanctions.
4711 2018-01-02 15:06:11 It was not money the US gave them. It was money that they had through oil and was being held by Sanctions. Dude, do you even comprehensively read?
4712 2018-01-02 15:06:10 Aw yes on closer look I can see that tunnel detail now (seems a little tight for space given this offslip would be mostly used by 40ft oil tankers). Was there ever any proposals to upgrade the existing Dee street junction?

4716 2018-01-02 15:05:36 And who the fuck is gonna get the oil? It ain't gonna go through Russia, Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran arent gonna let them pipe it out! So there aint gonna be more competition in the oil market just less oil

4718 2018-01-02 15:05:30 I thought you said China was shipping oil to NK.. Wouldn't that be Fake News?
4719 2018-01-02 15:05:17 After reading it all I find it dubious as export of oil is capped, not prohibited and this news outlet has questionalble credibility due to unethical practices that came to light during 2016 US presidential election.

4773 2018-01-02 14:59:50 Oil control karo. Jab oily ho thori si bhi face wash karlo.
4774 2018-01-02 14:59:47 and does knowing the amount means the amount of money collected by this administration? Let's not be sensational. Every billion you see is shared by FG/Joint ventures oil companies who helped explore and sell.
4775 2018-01-02 14:59:44 Maybe you’re ok with being an oil co experiment, cinnamon, & willing to take a chance, but then you’d only doom future generations to clean up the messes & consider your whole kind morons who caused it.

4790 2018-01-02 14:57:22 False. Scientists told the oil industry about anthropogenic climate change in 1959.

4884 2018-01-02 14:48:27 The hilarious part about this is you claim to be a Rockefeller GOP but you resist a roaring stock market and oil energy development all while insinuating a guy that runs a global traveling Twitter feed lives in a small bubble.  Must be that frontal lobe damage you referenced...
4885 2018-01-02 14:48:16 Last day of vacation.. need to be an adult.. Oil change, Hair Cut, Gym, take back/exchange some presents.. and it’s -6 
4886 2018-01-02 14:48:08 If you think yo man cheating on you.. Instead of going thru his phone...try giving him some ass and a sammich everyday for a week. Bet that nigga cut the grass, change the oil, mop the driveway and buy you a purse. 

Problem solved. 
4887 2018-01-02 14:48:08 Dimag ki batti Jalao.
Oily mathe pe oil dalke kya fayda!!

4888 2018-01-02 14:48:03 my brothers & fellow Nigerians UAE has more oil than Nigeria and speaking with facts Nigeria's problem didn't start with Buhari it started before he took over from the past administration
4889 2018-01-02 14:47:55 That aftermath of frying a fish. Our stove has lots of cooking oil. 
4890 2018-01-02 14:47:46 seven and two hin of your oil throughout a straight place. 13:1 It shall come to pass, saying, What hast thou done? help me, get no heed unto her, but lay your ways in innocency.

4892 2018-01-02 14:47:38 that head get #oil
4893 2018-01-02 14:47:38 Same way we have been running out of oil, “two years left” since 1976 I think.
4894 2018-01-02 14:47:30 Yes I did Ann, we were talking Sunday night at church about how we hated having Vick’s vapor rub shoved up our nose and having to take caster oil. My mother is 91 and I never heard her or my dad curse, and they certainly did not tolerate it. Mom used soap, dad a belt.
4895 2018-01-02 14:47:30 deliberatly bombing oil wells should be considered a war crime.
4896 2018-01-02 14:47:27 China and Russia are at least two countries giving them oil. You have YET to attack Russia for this.
4897 2018-01-02 14:47:18 My favorite are venison tenderloin cutlets, fried in olive oil.
4898 2018-01-02 14:47:15 if u said all citizen are equal and then why the hell u need minority status and why you not support #UniformCivilCode . Rest hold on. use Dr ortho oil..
4899 2018-01-02 14:47:12 I stopped using towels and that has made all the difference. A little oil on wet skin before lotion(or even sans lotion) helps. I live in Buffalo, NY fyi
4900 2018-01-02 14:46:59 I tried to abandon fact-checking for olive oil only to discover the industry is flush in counterfeit stuff so 
4901 2018-01-02 14:46:58 America needs to import oil until such impeccable service!
4902 2018-01-02 14:46:57 “Millennials worsen global warming because they’re not rushing to find an answer to it,” he writes, forgetting which generation owns and runs oil companies, coal companies, the food industry, the entire industrial sector
4903 2018-01-02 14:46:53 @msnbc Where is SEC CHAIRMAN Jay Clayton? When was his last interview, if any? Why is he so silent on the WALL ST. TRAITORS in bed with VIRTU PARTNERS of YUGO? His silence is deafening as "we the people" and "small businesses" face high gas/heating oil prices this winter.
4904 2018-01-02 14:46:43 You’ve been awful quiet about Russia supplying oil to N. Korea. Why is that?

4907 2018-01-02 14:46:19 The heart of our Middle East policy was, and is, easy & cheap access to oil. We have readily supported despots who hurt their own people, and expect gratitude if and when we remove them for our own convenience. It's also why #Trumps's #MuslimBan will never touch Saudi Arabia.
4908 2018-01-02 14:46:13 Got a nice bottle of organic massage oil as a gift. Just found out that all ingredients are also great for your hair. So... field test?

4916 2018-01-02 14:45:06 Perhaps they want to share the Russian oil they have

4920 2018-01-02 14:44:25 Yes, I believe treason should be punishable by imprisonment. Yours. 
Your collusion with Russia, your still-hidden tax returns (while screwing with ours) and more lies than a snake oil salesman. Justice will be ours.
4921 2018-01-02 14:44:24 เรื่องไรอะ
4922 2018-01-02 14:44:22 Not just oil but most recyclables as well.
4923 2018-01-02 14:44:20 Guess I missed that tweet about you blasting Putin and Russia for refueling the NKorean oil tanker to enable their nuke program.....
4924 2018-01-02 14:44:18 Did you try the lavender essential oil on her paws?
4925 2018-01-02 14:44:07 maybe tell Putin to stop shipping oil.  Oh wait you're his Bitch

4932 2018-01-02 14:43:14 Thanks for the information.....

what about like oil or corn syrup
4933 2018-01-02 14:43:04 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.

4935 2018-01-02 14:42:58 ถึงพี่คิมไม่ขอ ฮอตก็พร้อมที่จะตัดต่อโฮเข้าไปในรูปค่ะ55555555
4936 2018-01-02 14:42:57 Do you have proof of how much it was ? Also tbh It wasn’t about the oil. It’s about her having nothing but that and her hair. It’s about what she owned. Not what it was worth.
4937 2018-01-02 14:42:54 Sir, looks like, you have been rubbing Dr Ortho oil on all the wrong places. On the thinking part, I would suggest, “don’t think of me” at all. Your stalking is giving me chills.

Lastly, freedom of expression isn’t a one way street. Try inculcating the habit of listening.
4938 2018-01-02 14:42:50 Lol yeahhh blk ppl don’t need to wash their hair everyday , but aside from what she does make sure you putting oil or something on it daily .
4939 2018-01-02 14:42:48 Am I right in thinking the Iranian revolution which gave power to the Ayatollah’s was backed by the west as the Iranians were going to nationalise the country’s oil?

4942 2018-01-02 14:42:23 If trying #Veganuary my tip would be try Oat Milk @OatlyUK. especially good on cereals. The Oat Cream is splendid in coffee too. (warm it a bit to stop it separating). I like the Organic option myself, it doesn't have the vegetable oil in it that the regular one does.
4943 2018-01-02 14:42:16 basically: fry onion, lil bit of ginger and chilis in olive oil, add veg stock and tinned tomatoes, add a whole roasted yellow pepper and blend!
4944 2018-01-02 14:42:10 oh no. that’s too heavy of an oil for your whole face. a lot of oils are honestly too heavy for your face.
4945 2018-01-02 14:42:09 How does the cost of pollution, human health costs (deaths due to asthma, pollution-related illness) of oil extraction and coal compare to wind turbines (sorry Audubon) and solar? The First World has decided its environmentally and economically unsustainable.
4946 2018-01-02 14:42:03 Also, I would point out that Jimmy Carter was the only person happy about the infamous oil spill in Obama's time. Because he knew that he was officially NOT the worst president of the United States.
4947 2018-01-02 14:42:02 a duopoly like Google/Facebook needs more gov't intervention, like the ol' Standard Oil treatment.
4948 2018-01-02 14:42:00 One of our cars has oil in the coolant reservoir, which is often a warning of a serious problem.  Please join with us in praying that it will be a cheap and simple problem to fix!

4951 2018-01-02 14:41:44 Omg Bahahaha Hahahaha Jesus fuck this is quite possibly the dumbest thing you’ve tweeted to your peach popsicle penis. You’re really trying to mislead cult 45, sadly some will actually believe this even to Tillerson still sits in office, you know from the big oil company??
4952 2018-01-02 14:41:41 Russia is sneaking oil to Rocket Man, Donnie. Where is your outrage tough guy?
4953 2018-01-02 14:41:40 Yeah there's a threat to water in Oklahoma. Fracking. It's poisoning all the water.

The "Ogalala aquifer" is indeed drying up. If it's polluted by KeystoneXL oil - America's breadbasket will wither away.

4960 2018-01-02 14:41:05 Any plans for more Russia sanctions or enforcing the current ones - especially since they are allegedly transporting oil to NK at sea?
4961 2018-01-02 14:41:03 Mustard is among the best , other oils which are good are Ground nut , Soyabean, Flax seed oil, Cooking Olive oil, Rice Bran,Seasame oil . Canola and Sunflower are worst.

4965 2018-01-02 14:40:30 Sanctions? Russia is giving oil to N. Korea.
4966 2018-01-02 14:40:29 Replacing my oil well cap will be fun :-) but after replacing my spark plugs it’s obvious what was doing the damage

4999 2018-01-02 14:36:29 Um read about how oil extraction and coal are finally seen as unsustainable; not by this administration, but by the rest of the civilized WORLD. We pulled out of Paris Accords and everyone else stayed in. Even oil countries know the writing is on the wall.
5000 2018-01-02 14:36:27 Crude oil prices were undercut by carry-over weakness from Thursday's news that U.S. Oct crude production rose to a 46-year high of 9.64 million bpd.
5001 2018-01-02 14:36:13 Crude oil prices were boosted by the slide in the dollar index to a 3-month low and by carry-over support from Thursday's EIA data that showed U.S. crude inventories fell for a sixth week to a 2-year low and crude supplies at Cushing fell to a 2-3/4 year low.

Therefore, global warming and carbon tax are antithetical to their underlying belief.

5018 2018-01-02 14:34:06 Well, we haven't seen or heard a thing about any impact. Last up were China and Russia still supplying oil. Saw a couple soldiers attempting escapes. Haven't heard of "Rocket Man" making any offers, just South Korea. Twitter, not a good place for lame Trump "negotiations"?

5020 2018-01-02 14:34:04 I see some synergies there. Data is the new oil
5021 2018-01-02 14:34:01 まっくすはーと！
5022 2018-01-02 14:33:55 No they don't. We don't need an oil war
5023 2018-01-02 14:33:36 It’s easy. Boris will do sweet fuck all just like he did for the Yazidi in Kurdistan. Sweet nothing. Then at the correct time move in BP to take the oil. He did not even help the Kurds on independence for their own country. Do not trust England. Remember Hong Kong Opium for gold?
5024 2018-01-02 14:33:21 You are incredibly absolutely wrong: Obama INCTEASED our independence, oil extraction is a dying industry due to FRACKING. Get a grip. Why do you think GM has committed to an all electric future and Saudi’s Arabia is going to diversify their economy AWAY from oil?
5025 2018-01-02 14:33:11 He isn’t reading anything, just listening to his friends who don’t read anything so his info is wrong except yes, Iran has oil.
5026 2018-01-02 14:33:06 Sir, looks like you have been rubbing Dr Ortho oil on all the wrong places. On the thinking part, I would suggest, “don’t think of me” at all. Your stalking is giving me chills.

Lastly, freedom of expression isn’t a one way street. Try inculcating the habit of listening.
5027 2018-01-02 14:33:06 Please make responsible comments Mr. Rahul Gandhi. Don’t pour oil in the fire . You should be calming down the protestants and make everyone unite instead of quoting anything . Shame on you
5028 2018-01-02 14:33:05 How about American freedoms? We lost network neutrality, voting rights, congress giving our money to corruptions, police shooting innocent people, public lands and parks given to big oil, and a part time president who spends most of his time giving himself more money for golfing.
5029 2018-01-02 14:32:52 Um, didn’t we just catch a Russian ship giving oil to NK.  And how many soldiers are fleeing?  Are we talking 1/2 or hundreds?  So Russians are undermining your sanctions and you are exaggerating or lying about soldiers fleeing.
5030 2018-01-02 14:32:43 This coconut oil @AsimSupreme  I’m obsessed !!!!
5031 2018-01-02 14:32:43 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
5032 2018-01-02 14:32:37 BMW takes so much oil I almost thought it was an American car
5033 2018-01-02 14:32:34 So what are you going to do with your dear friend Xi Jinping, now that he's been caught overriding those sanctions by providing North Korea with oil?
5034 2018-01-02 14:32:31 It is has always been an oil tanker.

5036 2018-01-02 14:32:27 Canola should not even be in the list. You should have Sesame oil and Coconut oil. Wow you do not have the two MUST have oils in the list. Right from Ayurveda to grannies in the south would have Sesame and Coconut oil in their shelves.
5037 2018-01-02 14:32:12 They are now getting their oil from Russian tankers

5040 2018-01-02 14:32:00 Part four tax bill trillions more in corporate welfare banks, oil, coal, prescription drugs, cable, etc.  IMF externalities on net - pollution, etc.  Corrupt banks over $200 billion in fines when should paid trillions
5041 2018-01-02 14:31:56 North Korea could not collapse because China poured oil at night for them. US surveillance satellites can not capture the night. Negotiations between North Korea and South Korea are just jokes.
5042 2018-01-02 14:31:55 I respect Nadler's knowledge & talents but the Dems have long since abandoned anything remotely like progressive values, abandoned the poor & have no meaningful or effective environment policies or public health!

5050 2018-01-02 14:30:47 I need coconut oil... asap
5051 2018-01-02 14:30:47 Weren’t you just accusing China of delivering oil to NK last week?  So the sanctions are working because they’re not being adhered to?  You’ve tweeted about every topic covered by Fox & Friends so far this morning. You are nothing but an inept pig staining the presidency. STFU.
5052 2018-01-02 14:30:44 What about Russia giving NK oil? That ok with you ass kisser?
5053 2018-01-02 14:30:38 Climate Change fanatics don’t seem to care when other less regulated countries refine, dig and transfer oil.

Just when America does it?

5058 2018-01-02 14:30:16 Trust me, it's not the oil. It's the amount of collective magnetism disturbing permafrost creating acid ocean water. El Niño. It's above all totally not Russia's problem

5067 2018-01-02 14:29:12 The magintsky act. Weapons in Ukraine. We condemned their use of oil tank bombs. North Korea. This is all just in the last year. But you think... Somehow... They are getting their way? Have your opinion, but don't like to validate it.
5068 2018-01-02 14:29:09 Yet STILL no sanctions against Russia, even though they are supplying North Korea with oil?!
5069 2018-01-02 14:29:09 “I’m really sorry but I prefer only salads and vegetables sauted in only Olive Oil.”

5070 2018-01-02 14:29:05 How to support change in Middle East:  The United States is so awash in oil that petroleum-rich Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil and natural gas company is reportedly interested in investing in the fertile Texas Permian Basin shale region.

5074 2018-01-02 14:28:59 If Trump were able to be anodyne, oil and water would mix seamlessly, rivers would begin to flow upstream, the sun would rise in the West.  Heck, Mexico might even pay for that wall on our shared border.

Defies belief. Complete madness.
5077 2018-01-02 14:28:54 We don't have oil, what's wrong with trying to run a successful club while not endangering the whole clubs future.
5078 2018-01-02 14:28:48 Boris your statement is as poor as the Canadian Government Trudeau who openly welcomes ISIS fighters with love in Canada. Get your ass in gear and move in your MI6 then your oil company British Petroleum into Iran. It’s there for your taking like in Iraq. BP in Basra Iraq. Shame.
5079 2018-01-02 14:28:37 The treatment should be allowed. It’s appalling to me that it isn’t being allowed. Any experimental treatment should be allowed a person who is dying. 

If someone disagrees with this, get the movie Lorenzo’s Oil and let me know how you feel after watching it.
5080 2018-01-02 14:28:18 Not because of that, because the role her father played in the destruction of my country Nigeria. Not quite long the Oil Subsidy Fraud. His company was indicted. What does that mean to you. I am not an hater, I am accomplished in life.

5089 2018-01-02 14:27:01 Is your head really buried that deep in a hole? Do u not see China & Russia have used u to weaken the US to the point we can be overtaken? China and Russia are supplying oil to NK. Where do u think NK suddenly got nuclear weapons? Was it Russia or China? U r being played!!
5090 2018-01-02 14:26:56 His GE turbine example is a laugh. PRC built PV industry with cheap labor, sure, but also huge public R&D investment. GER did same thing, but with $$ labor. US policy is run by oil companies.
5091 2018-01-02 14:26:46 there was a fish n chip shop across the road from my primary school and one of my classmates wrote “CANOLA OIL IS GE” on the window using a correctional fluid pen then another classmate told her someone had called the police about it and she started crying

5099 2018-01-02 14:25:11 Extreme cold can boost heating oil consumption, in addition to fuels like propane, and those products can pull other products up in value as refiners can alter what they're producing.

5137 2018-01-02 14:20:07 $OIL Oil prices posted their strongest opening  since 2014 , with crude rising to mid-2015 highs amid large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.
5138 2018-01-02 14:20:06 European stocks started 2018 in the red in the first trading day of the year as auto stocks fell and metals and mining stocks reversed after a strong run up last week with gains by banks and oil companies not enough to stall declines

Come back Tom when you know what the fuck you are talking about.
5168 2018-01-02 14:17:51 No, just because someone is famous/talented and does it in oil instead of film does not make it any less intentionally sexual in nature. Not that hard to understand.

5170 2018-01-02 14:17:12 India in conflict with Pakistan. Russia with highly fragile oil dependent economy who can never help his less fortunate allies, China who has almost 140 million citizens living on $1 a day...We’ll not able to see US replacement by another super power in our life time.

5180 2018-01-02 14:16:10 $ weakness is a theme for this start of year. Watch for gold to react on the back of this. Oil majors, independents & service companies will benefit from disruption in Iran...
5181 2018-01-02 14:16:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but to have a country.
5182 2018-01-02 14:16:03 Ask your friend Putin to stop circumventing sanctions by sending him oil and they might work quicker with more devastating effect.
5183 2018-01-02 14:15:49 When cold weather impacts the New England Grid/ISO, 32% of electricity is generated by OIL, old inefficient, dirty plants. Over 5000 MW of oil, and wind is just over 600mw. We need more gas capacity pipelines, and new efficient plants, cheap clean gas is only 200 miles away.

5203 2018-01-02 14:13:54 A couple days ago you essentially we're saying the opposite. You know your Russian buddy violating the sanctions sending oil. But hey you're Putin's butt boy so don't mention that.
5204 2018-01-02 14:13:41 Don't mean much as long as you let Russa send oil to North Korea. 
Just Saying DUTARD!
5205 2018-01-02 14:13:40 I’d love to see how Russia would react if the sanctions on them that YOU SIGNED, as well as 99% of Congress, were actually implemented. Give it a try, OK? Maybe we can make them stop delivering oil and other goods to NK.
5206 2018-01-02 14:13:39 any comment on Russia supplying North Korea with crude oil at sea. Kinda tough to claim outrage when Trump's buddy pulls a fast one

I believe "red handed" was your assessment when China was accused. You've said fucking nothing about Russia though. Suspicious much?

5222 2018-01-02 14:12:25 The state of new York has a bigger GDP than Russia. To put it into perspective, Russia has nine different time zones, it's the biggest country in the world and contain a third of world's oil and gas deposits. New York have some really nice tall buildings and central park.

Why the fuck are you putting oil in the fire ?
5304 2018-01-02 14:04:44 These are also the same people (#Conservative, not necessarily #Republican), who caused the original upheaval in Iran decades ago by installing the Shah as our puppet regime to get their oil. The Iranian people were driven into the arms of religious extremism by our actions.

5316 2018-01-02 14:03:04 What more can they do currently?. Cut income taxes.yes.  Infrastructure is not in place currently for targeted direct cash transfer, so they cant do that. they will probably go for something like 3.5% fisc deficit. Beyond that is calling for trouble especially when oil's rising

5320 2018-01-02 14:02:38 It feels like -27 degrees out & mfs are lined up outside waiting for us to open at 8 for an oil change, wat the honest fuck
5321 2018-01-02 14:02:38 The Dept of Energy was created in response to the oil embargo and the massive gas shortages in the 70's. At the very least it has allowed the development of alternative energies. The two sides of the issues is go totally green or burn baby burn. Neither are correct.
5322 2018-01-02 14:02:33 The "Trabi" would actually go at least 80km/h and even 100 were feasible. There must have been something wrong - most likely too much oil and therewith oily spark plugs ;)

5337 2018-01-02 14:00:49 Disagree. There is a fallacy in trying to use US based models in predicting global economy outcomes. As long as dollar continues to weaken and oil remains in $60 range, the global economy should continue to grow.

Btw oil and gas are mined at the same time so they're not separate industries. Go take an intro environmental class u sound dumb

5495 2018-01-02 13:43:10 Right & left are more fluid terms though.

5506 2018-01-02 13:42:03 I think just relying on EV is not a good idea because it has a lot of limitations along with benefits. So if there are several alternates to reduce pollution and oil purchase burden, it would be better for the country

5522 2018-01-02 13:40:31 This first happened in Tunisia back in 2011 that led to the so-called Arab Spring that didn't seem to infect countries that toe the US  line.

Oil prices are less than obscene

5590 2018-01-02 13:31:14 Then you really need to start to understand how a refinery works and how refiners make decision on crude oil buying.

5627 2018-01-02 13:26:58 This is a tricky issue... if Trump takes credit for higher oil prices (helping the oil industry)... how would his fans react (hurt by higher fuel costs)?

5693 2018-01-02 13:16:57 If only US had allowed him to take Iran on the welfare economy path use oil for people. US greed for oil led to rise of Khomeni. A proud and ancient civilization sodomized by US and Ayatollahs.
5694 2018-01-02 13:16:39 You should look at the profit margin on a gallon of gas compared to the taxes you pay on a gallon of gas. You won’t be blaming the oil company for gas prices after you do that.

5722 2018-01-02 13:12:33 Everyone should note the Trump/Tillerson/Putin complex through the Exxon Mobil private deal with Russian Oil, Russia provides a large percent of US oil. And civil unrest in Middle East directly profits them all. #ResistanceUnited
5723 2018-01-02 13:12:16 It's a Culling. While the rest of the Arab world look on. Because the US buys their oil. Money.. no, greed.. Then they have the nerve to pray?? 

I know Israel is Apartheid. Totally. Agree.

5741 2018-01-02 13:09:29 I tend to love a hot shower, so I end my showers with cold water otherwise my pores are all just open, especially because we gotta cream/oil once we come out it’s better to do so with closed pores! I recommend exfoliating only 2-3 times a week and face mask on the other days.
5742 2018-01-02 13:09:20 It’s a must I get an oil change tomorrow
5743 2018-01-02 13:09:11 Who will build more coal power plants and use more oil and gas. Virtue signalling at its finest. Liberals know how to waste money on policies that look nice and accomplish nothing!
5744 2018-01-02 13:09:09 Love how you suddenly pretend to care about human rights. You were in China and said nothing to them about it at all. All you care about is justifying the end of the Iran deal so that oil companies get windfall profits again.

5769 2018-01-02 13:05:15 And Iran is gunning the "freedom protesters" down in the streets, while we sit by and do nothing. Just like we let the Kurds fight and die killing ISIS, then turn our back and do nothing while Turkey bombs and murders them because of Turkish greed for oil. Erdogan = ISIS. #MAGA

5795 2018-01-02 13:01:49 Ghee is best(ideally from A2 or buffalo)
 As per Ashtanghridyam, thicker the oil better it is : by that rule unrefined mustard is best. Olive oil virgin is also good, but many of them are not good for cooking but dressing on salads because they have low burning temperatures
5796 2018-01-02 13:01:47 To hell with your aid, we don't need any. It's US who attacked countries in the name of terrorism, rob all their wealth (gold, oil everything) & then keep giving little help to the ppl whose wealth they have looted.

5817 2018-01-02 12:59:23 Just have to find out which oil Congress and his associates in consultation with RaGa has purchased since Gujarat election results, I think that oil must be healthy to fire caste politics in India.

Money Changes Everything. @MyEnergyUSA
5820 2018-01-02 12:59:21 Why is GoK so in a hurry to export this Turkana oil?? Last i checked oil prices goes up cost of living usually goes up. My thought is we should at least retain 50% of the oil for local consumption, make it cheaper and make our peoples lives cheaper. But then again this is Kenya
5821 2018-01-02 12:58:56 What the president wants to do  regarding oil is definitely a great thing. This country needs to drill its own oil the oil is here we don't need to buy it elsewhere and pay more It's about time the Americans got a break when it comes to oil need Independence.

5840 2018-01-02 12:56:35 @ananavarro thinking outside the “wall,” please discuss:
Smugglers(people/guns/drugs) tunnels have to be addressed for the wall to be effective. This can be done using the ground penetrating radar oil companies have used for decades. Otherwise a physical wall is basically futile.
5841 2018-01-02 12:56:14 My face’s oil production is at an all time high today wow
5842 2018-01-02 12:56:06 The Dakota pipeline is now pumping 1.5 million barrels of oil a day into the US economy. Good solid jobs and safer than shipping by boat rail or truck.
5843 2018-01-02 12:55:55 Going by what @OfficeOfRG said recently about casteism it depends for whom the oil is needed? Is it for Janeu dhari Brahmins, Dalits, Hardicks or for JNU’s long living desh ke tukde students!
5844 2018-01-02 12:55:52 Old Faithful will be capped and channeled to provide steam injection fracking for the oil we’ll extract from Wyoming. So much winning.
5845 2018-01-02 12:55:38 Importantly it was for Iran's oil and @BP_plc profits that conservative PM Mr Churchill helped take down a popular liberal democratic PM of Iran - Mr Mossadegh. The conservatives installed the unpopular Shah and this directly led to the Islamic Revolution.

5850 2018-01-02 12:55:11 Jan 2 1974: Pres Nixon signs legislation requiring states to limit highway speeds to 55 MPH as a way of conserving gasoline in the face of an OPEC oil embargo. The 55 mph limit was effectively phased out in 1987; federal speed limits were abolished in 1995.
5851 2018-01-02 12:55:09 I have to get a oil change after work but yes
5852 2018-01-02 12:55:07 @gtbynum Tulsa was created by railroad junctions to serve agriculture and oil industry.  Aviation came net.  Agriculture  and oil are not so important anymore.  Aviation is the primary basis for Tulsa economy but we need to foster other industries to support out economy.
5853 2018-01-02 12:55:07 The intention of Divide&Rule in M/E, was to ensure instability in the Oil Market.

This promoted the Petro-Dollar after Nixon in 1971, to secure the $US strength.

Now its for control between the East & West.  Hence the drive for the New Babylon.

5874 2018-01-02 12:52:42 so part of my new years resolution - which i never even have one but this year is different - is to be more positive.

5879 2018-01-02 12:52:24 also, there pillow cases you can get which absorb the oil from your face at night - you wash them every 3/4 days; and wash your face with only cold water, lukewarm at hottest!
5880 2018-01-02 12:52:18 this is Iran we're talking about.  same Iran the US have been trying to rob of oil for 65 years!

you think Iranians didn't see what the zionists did in Syria?

5882 2018-01-02 12:52:08 I know the caparison against Iran was so unfair, I mean its an oil producing nation with a larger military budget, scores way better on HDI than Pakistan and has a much bigger GDP per capita than Pakistan plus no wars, stable regime etc etc and Pak was still able to do better
5883 2018-01-02 12:52:08 Use whatever oil your ancestors were using. For Keralites it is coconut oil. Use cold compressed or filtered oil. No need to go for exotic oils like Olive. Avoid deep frying as far as possible and do not reuse heated oil.
5884 2018-01-02 12:51:55 Olive oil only!!!
5885 2018-01-02 12:51:50 I've had olbas oil directly on my forehead and cheekbones. Been the only way I could get to sleep. Also steam with Vicks.

Coconut oil is the best as per 20000+ year old ayerveda for Indian style of cooking

Olive Oil is NOT suitable for Indian style of deep & prolonged cooking

5896 2018-01-02 12:50:41 My Dr says use any vegetable oil. Recommended groundnut, even sunflower but says keep changing cooking oils every 3rd month
5897 2018-01-02 12:50:40 it is said cold pressed oil is good for health.
5898 2018-01-02 12:50:33 Well then stay put. Did you try steaming with olbas oil? 4Head on temples and anywhere that hurts ('cept too near the eyes obvs) Nurofen? Rubbing Vicks on your chest and feet?
5899 2018-01-02 12:50:26 pantry garlic soup. favorite kind of broth homemade or canned (a pot full worth). a can or two of chopped tomatoes with peppers (rotel is good). slice and saute an entire head of garlic and add. then toast sliced french bread in the garlic olive oil in same pan and float on top.
5900 2018-01-02 12:50:14 They all do in this weather. They dont like the cold just like us. Make sure u let it run for a few mintues to let the oil & fluids circulate good.

5915 2018-01-02 12:48:18 Olive is the best- most omega3s and other unsaturated fatty acids. Unfortunately you can't hear it to high so for deep frying vegetable or peanut oil will be OK. Canola is OK as well if used at lower temp as well.

5943 2018-01-02 12:42:54 Agreed, but why pitch methanol against EV! I believe they need to have a coherent multi pronged strategy.
There are various alternatives EV, hydrogen fuel, methanol etc. We need to have strategy to adopt all these to achieve our goals to reduce oil bill and pollution.
5944 2018-01-02 12:42:50 Noooooo coconut oil can clog your pores! the problem with that is that it stays on the surface so if you don't have enough moisture on the skin, it just protects it from the cold but nothing else.

6003 2018-01-02 12:32:32 We take their oil, may as well pinch their flag too.
6004 2018-01-02 12:32:30 Haha hi Claire! Its always going to be hot, even mixed with oil and made into a paste. I would mix it with yoghurt to get the heat level down and it can be used as a marinade that way. Does that help?

6011 2018-01-02 12:30:58 All of a sudden, once money and power is involved, Trump cares about Iranians and Muslims. 
Also an underlying knowing that war in the Middle East profits Exxon Mobil and their ties to Russian oil, directly into the pockets of Tillerson/Trump/Putin complex. 
6012 2018-01-02 12:30:45 Theory... this is all connected to Russia and the trump administration. Oil prices go up from Middle East unrest, suddenly the $500 billion Exxon deal gets put on the table.
6013 2018-01-02 12:30:45 Need to hurry up & get this oil change
6014 2018-01-02 12:30:27 Stanford economist Tony Seba: due to electric cars oil demand will peak at 100 million barrels per day by 2020 and drop to 70 million barrels per day by 2030. Major losers countries LIKE Venezuela, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Russia.

6035 2018-01-02 12:28:10 Why not? We should go there and free those people from an evil theocratic rule. It would be more noble than trading our soldiers lives for oil like our last venture to the middle east.
6036 2018-01-02 12:27:49 In most cases Stephen, when an African country finds oil, its exported to bring in foreign currency and allows the country to borrow money. Oil found in the UK over 50 yrs ago, has not stopped solar sales growing, if there is government support as you now have in Kenya for SWH

6044 2018-01-02 12:26:10 I am reminded also of Reagan's ironic use of the term " freedom fighters" in Central America. If you're getting involved in the middle East, one has to wonder exactly who you are backing and why. Maybe you just hate anyone Obama got along with? Or maybe once again it's the oil?
6045 2018-01-02 12:25:45 5 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.

6047 2018-01-02 12:25:03 This is how you do government corruption in a nation that is not oil rich.  
You turn public goods to private assets and sell off the state guaranteed revenue stream then get kickbacks and seats on the board for your efforts.

6102 2018-01-02 12:15:31 also think like this:  the energy density of biomass is very low. At, say 700kg/m3 (=compacted biomass): you are mainly transporting air and water (say 80%) only to capture the 'burneable' 6C. 1 ltr oil therefore is 40GJ, 1 liter compacted biomass only 8-10GJ After drying; 18 max

6137 2018-01-02 12:11:15 This happened to us over the summer. They tried to make a hole in the tank but when they only managed to crack it they broke the pipe. I wouldn't mind but there was  only about €100 worth of oil but they did €400 worth of damage
6138 2018-01-02 12:10:59 Considering the country is at war
and oil revenues dropped significantly
imposing taxes and lifting subsidies were the most logical choices to sustain
6139 2018-01-02 12:10:55 You know who can change your oil 
6140 2018-01-02 12:10:52 Plus white flour is sooo bad nutrition-wise.
For me it just soaks up too much oil for my system, I can't eat most frybread.

6153 2018-01-02 12:07:52 It is true that if we burn all the oil there will not be lubricants.  Good point - let's not burn the oil and let's work together on a better solution.

6584 2018-01-02 10:33:36 Hi Tyra, thanks for getting in touch, we've spoken with our experts and they have said that this is most likely due to the colder weather solidifying the coconut oil more than usual.  Does it all taste alright? :)

6616 2018-01-02 10:27:35 In trading commodities, crude oil is measured in barrels, precious metals in troy ounce. But on Judgment Day, deeds are measured in ATOMS!

6624 2018-01-02 10:24:51 Oil has risen the highest since 16' giving energy stocks a boost - with potential for higher in the future. Seems the OPEC-Led agrrement to cap oil production is working.

6650 2018-01-02 10:20:34 Not at all. Scotland will be in the enviable position of producing all its requirements without the need for that in the near future. But much of the world won’t be in our position & will want our oil.

6652 2018-01-02 10:19:55 All the oil skill sets are British - how would Scotland ensure that the Welsh Irish English get their share ? Is there a Scottish national oil company ? Who would finance it ? RBS (technically bust & owned by British shareholders/taxpayers). Essentially tourism is the only asset
6653 2018-01-02 10:19:48 Did Russia, Brazil, Venezuela, Saudi Arabian, UAE , Libya or other Arab oil reach state LIBERALISE and FULL Deregulated there various oil sector to achieve greatness.???

6667 2018-01-02 10:17:31 While public transport apparently costs money and revenues are raised from petrol, I’d like to see a full economic analysis.

6811 2018-01-02 09:43:11 Wear a rose quartz amulet to sleep tonight. It's as good for you as oil pulling without taking the extra time.
6812 2018-01-02 09:43:04 Simply pricing oil in dollars does not confer oil backing to the dollar. Investment by oil producers in dollar denominated assets, on the other hand, and $ denominated loans to oil producers, do support the dollar

6818 2018-01-02 09:42:11 We would recommend using the oil pre moisturiser as it is for intense hydration. This wouldn’t be used in conjunction with the serum as it would be too much for the skin. We’d suggest alternate when using the serum and oil. – Staci

6841 2018-01-02 09:34:30 It's -12 right now at my house, the oil froze in the lines running to my furnace, think about how cold it has to be for the oil to have to freeze. I am trying to figure out what is your point? Sorry if you needed a sweater.

6844 2018-01-02 09:34:13 Look elsewhere for the future. Oil is not the future. The earlier Nigerians especially my folks in the Niger delta know this,  the better bcos the north or SW will never share their resources. Time to act is now. Use your 13% to build the future.

6868 2018-01-02 09:31:08 Now let's hope they listen to this...

I do highly doubt it after seeing how much oil they are still trading.
6869 2018-01-02 09:31:07 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, however they go out fast.
6870 2018-01-02 09:31:00 I think China is doing just its work he is not helping them in war with u China want to stable its economy by giving oil

You are forever anointed with the oil  of uniqueness
6885 2018-01-02 09:27:59 In Oklahoma school systems are funded by oil companies which dictate the agendas in subjects like science where they say that oil is our a friend. Totally disgusting and needs to have something done about it
6886 2018-01-02 09:27:36 Here's the deal. Either we have a provincial carbon tax, or a federal one. You won't get no tax. Major oil companies are in favour of carbon pricing. So suck it up. Life isn't fair.
6887 2018-01-02 09:27:12 The reason their fried chicken is so good is because they fry it in peanut oil. It costs more so most places don't use it. It makes a world of difference in taste.

6891 2018-01-02 09:26:07 I honestly do not think a rising oil price is good for us. It makes our govt officials lazy and irresponsible in spending.

6960 2018-01-02 09:13:11 Yeah. I don’t understand the FSG out campaigners. Yes we could have some free spending oil billionaires as owners. But those are few and far between...we could have a damn sight worse than FSG too. You don’t have to look too far further back to find worse. Fucksakes.

7231 2018-01-02 08:11:35 I'm a huge proponent of adding vets as long as they're capable of doing the job. I've felt this way since the very 1st overall pick the #oilers made.

Not sure why the oilers feel the need to try and replicate the 80s dynasty so badly.
7232 2018-01-02 08:11:30 What are you talking about. I said they should ad atleast 1-2 more vets.

7290 2018-01-02 08:00:54 Yes! The amount of oil my skin still casually produces throughout the day is not that much, and I don't even feel it being any heavy! I kept touching my cheeks to check, and it still feels like as if I just applied a daily cream on my face

7465 2018-01-02 07:28:20 Banning the use of sustainable certified palm oil could lead to more deforestation, as other oil crops have considerably less yield per hectare. We'll share this with our team for review and consideration for alternatives in future. :) 2/2

7468 2018-01-02 07:28:14 The palm oil used in our own branded food products supports the production of RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil. Palm oil is a versatile and efficient choice with significantly higher yields of oil per hectare than soya beans, rapeseed or sunflowers. 1/2

7496 2018-01-02 07:20:47 You don’t get all of those situations in practice alone. You need reps against a variety of real PK units.
7497 2018-01-02 07:20:47 Gas powered cars have maybe 15-20 years left on the road. Oil is an archaic macro-energy source. Short sighted financial gain is not worth long term repercussions. If it wasn't still a financial motivator it would've been replaced 30 years ago.

7507 2018-01-02 07:18:31 Shell has a carbon capture facility, partially paid for with tax $. Of course they are on board with the carbon tax. Big oil is also receiving hundreds of millions from Notley to increase production efficincies, great for their bottom line!
7508 2018-01-02 07:18:21 Not a single thing has changed. The one major change McClellan has made since he started coaching was to give Drai his own line. Can you think of many other changes that weren't created by personnel change at the GM level?

7520 2018-01-02 07:16:07 Can’t practice in a game if you don’t first practice in practice. My point is McClellan doesn’t change a dam thing. So it doesn’t really matter.

7544 2018-01-02 07:12:16 Lol! If you’re superstitious, at least it’s no longer January 1. I think something (being sour due to officiating in your case) only carries over throughout the year if it happens on Jan 1. So let’s hope it doesn’t carry over.

7557 2018-01-02 07:10:41 PVC sounds like a good choice for chlorine resistance vs reasonable cost. How about bubbling into molten sulfur (115C oil bath) for more reaction? or CS2 sulfur solution, which will give you some CCl4 byproduct.

7564 2018-01-02 07:09:35 That’s one of my biggest frustration lol we just can’t get any calls. It’s quite common on Alberta teams actually (based on what Rex said from his “rate of calls” work..we’re getting a lot less relative to league average..of course, it’s tedious to track so sample size is small)

7567 2018-01-02 07:08:36 Hot Oil is godly. Take it from this Chinese guy. You need that shiz on everything if you like spicy food. It adds so much to food!

7595 2018-01-02 07:04:17 I’ve said that many times.
7596 2018-01-02 07:04:16 Yeah, it’s tough. PP relies a lot on momentum/rhythm. We are 30th overall in penalties drawn so we’re not getting the necessary reps we need to gain traction.

7613 2018-01-02 07:01:43 Could be good if klefbom is back. They atleast have to change it so they have more then one option for a one timer. They lose so many options cause of the lack of onetimer options. Which is why they aren’t getting enough shots from the point to open up the defence.

7644 2018-01-02 06:55:24 @NTAGMN The major risk for Nigeria’s economy is the uncertainty of peace in Niger Delta which could hamper oil output and investment. Addressing the challenges facing the people of Niger Delta would lead to better economic outcomes in 2018.

7654 2018-01-02 06:53:17 Unsurprising in a system where maximizing profit rules all. "Big" anything (oil, pharma, aerospace, etc) seeks only to maintain itself at the expense of anything that might restrict or reduce its wealth and power.

7657 2018-01-02 06:52:25 You’re mistaking your group of low info extremists for Albertans. You realize big business, oil companies, investors and most intelligent Albertans demand action on climate change. Ctax is the cheapest and most effective toll to reduce emissions.

7789 2018-01-02 06:28:32 Let me put on my coconut oil and shea butter and get in bed
7790 2018-01-02 06:28:32 The last part of this I totally agree on although it doesn’t make sense for pk struggles but does for the pp.
7791 2018-01-02 06:28:32 New year, better* skin care routine: wash makeup off EVERY. NIGHT. No excuses! And apply castor oil to brows and lash line  cheers to moisturized, clear and clean skin, and fuller, thicker brows and lashes!
7792 2018-01-02 06:28:25 You need to take yr healing to another level: try Tibetan medicine. There’s this long distance healer: just send her a cheque. There’s this supplement my friend sells. Do this diet, that diet. Take emu oil. Have you done accupunture? Have you tried not thinking about it so much?
7793 2018-01-02 06:28:19 Shea butter and coconut oil is cool but it’s really nothing better for your beard than toto
7794 2018-01-02 06:28:02 You’re so right, that and peppermint oil 
7795 2018-01-02 06:27:20 So basically. Parboil taters. Drain. Season (salt pepper olive oil garlic herbs paprika maple syrup). Cook on bottom of oven. 30 minutes. Turn. Add chickpeas and more oil and toss. Another 20 minutes in middle of oven.
7796 2018-01-02 06:27:10 -coach has no control with regards to matchups so I think they tend to play simple play because every line will get to taste opposing top line. It’s the “play a simple boring hockey that wins you games” type of mentality. No need to impress because it’s not home crowd.

Cinch the waist with a nice belt, drop one sleeve a little low to give shoulder, and add extra body oil to the clavicles for highlight.

7803 2018-01-02 06:26:27 I am picturing the same corridor of hell. Isn't it ironic that the global circus is fueled by the quest for oil?

7811 2018-01-02 06:25:01 Yes for starters. I don’t like Lucic on the power play. I feel he slows it down. Call me crazy but I’d like to see kassian causeing havoc in front of the net out there.
7812 2018-01-02 06:24:36 On the road, there’s a few things I feel that happens [This is just my opinion/observation]:
-players go to places together (dinner, hotel rooms mix vet and kids) which promotes constant communication to teammates (valuable for a young team)
7813 2018-01-02 06:24:24 a mixture of pork, Napa cabbage, carrots, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil
7814 2018-01-02 06:24:22 I am still uncertain as to whether Emu Oil (also a "health" supplement) actually contains emu extract
7815 2018-01-02 06:24:16 Oil over candles, lights down low.. (knuckles cracked)... Let's get it 
7816 2018-01-02 06:24:15 It is always sad when so called educated people don't understand simple economics. PMB took over an oil dependant economy. Price crude then

7948 2018-01-02 06:04:04 The more the U.S. tries interfering with Iranian politics, the less likely that true reform will be successful.

8070 2018-01-02 05:39:48 This job got me putting tea tree oil all over my face 
8071 2018-01-02 05:39:38 Girl I know. I think about that everyday all I have is oil and my spray bottle 
8072 2018-01-02 05:39:34 “Are you nuts?! I can't just talk to a girl I've had sex with,which frankly is like changing the oil on a rental car...”
8073 2018-01-02 05:39:33 Sucks that fracking competed with the profit margins of offshore drilling, a lot of petroleum engineers don't have as much work in oil now
8074 2018-01-02 05:39:02 It's just the death knell. Go ahead, oil companies, raise prices! You'll just accelerate the switch over to electric, with solar and wind and other renewables as our source for recharging. Fossil fuels are already done, but there's a lag in implementation. That's all.
8075 2018-01-02 05:39:00 she can also probably do you a custom one with, e.g., just shea butter/beeswax/olive oil, if you ask
8076 2018-01-02 05:38:58 I do.  I think there is a better use for them than digging them up and sending them out. Refine oil, use natural gas for plastics production, smelt metals, make steel.  We have so much potential and too much of a mentality of depending on raw exports instead of using resources.
8077 2018-01-02 05:38:36 Tourism to the coast and ski hills in the center/southern BC are the draws. Who wants to come here and see open pit coal mines, aging dams or 20,000 oil and gas sites? Maybe drive on the Alaska Highway and get into a head on with a drunk patch worker. Fun in the north.
8078 2018-01-02 05:38:27 Ok so the bottle doesnt say but um how much castor oil do I need to drink to get a beard? Please respond asap
8079 2018-01-02 05:38:20 surely there will be no lack of ill-meaners and other idiots pouring oil into fire...
8080 2018-01-02 05:38:20 @such_A_frknlady @itsKARY_ I was hoping he was going to the altar to grab the oil. I think she needs some prayer...
8081 2018-01-02 05:38:12 Can't send a pic 'cause I et it. Sweet potatoes O'Brien stir fry in olive oil w/ broccoli, jalapeño, green & red bell, onion, criminies & garlic. Topped w/ free range poached egg & a little marinara. Half a bagel w/ neufchatel. Gunpowder tea. In a bowl. Sort of "hippie food."

8084 2018-01-02 05:37:24 I bought an oil diffuser for my car...I'm too bougie to be alive
8085 2018-01-02 05:37:21 So put the oil b.s. away. There is no government who won't sell resources. NOT ONE.
8086 2018-01-02 05:36:57 Call the oil company that services your furnace- they can get someone out soon.
8087 2018-01-02 05:36:42 For your information, America can buy our oil from a islamic nut job or democracy. They want to make to oppress ppl.
8088 2018-01-02 05:36:33 6/7 - The lapses included ignoring alarms in their system and trying to restart the pipeline twice, which discharged more oil.

8092 2018-01-02 05:35:51 4/7 - Enbridge's disastrous Kalamazoo River oil spill in Michican in July 2010 took an estimated $1.21 billion and four years to PARTIALLY clean up. A Sierra Club report detailed that since 1999, Enbridge has had 800 spills, including spills in Wisconsin and neighboring states.

8095 2018-01-02 05:35:27 3/7 - The pipeline is carrying roughly 400,000 barrels of Tar Sands-derived and lighter conventional crude oil. The environmental assessment that was done in 2006 was prior to one of the largest spills -- probably the largest inland oil spill -- in American history.
8096 2018-01-02 05:35:02 2/7 - Global Pipeline Partners, is a joint venture made up of four companies building oil pipelines for Enbridge Inc. Enbridge Line 61, that runs from Superior to Delavan, hasn't received the national attention that the Keystone XL Pipeline.

8101 2018-01-02 05:33:41 Good for now!!! We are not taking over their war. W we are trying to make America great again with strength and power over the rest of the world we can't help other people unless we have that they have drained our resources from oil to money.

8114 2018-01-02 05:31:42 Now..north Korea wants to “participate” in the winter Olympic Games... after South Korea confiscated 2 oil vessels.  North Korea in trouble, more than obvious
8115 2018-01-02 05:31:28 Oil/rubber embargo vs Imperial in 1940 lead to 'peace talks'. 

Japan, unwilling to lose face & withdraw from  AND about to run out/grind to halt w/o oil/rubber by early 42' opted for Pearl Harbor .  Illogical to Western thinking.

8131 2018-01-02 05:29:32 lol don't blame you. You get my meaning though?
We could be growing power while harnessing it freely from whatever we discover safely makes it and stores it to. There are so many options and alternatives to oil in every  industry but oil based ones.
8132 2018-01-02 05:29:16 Not really.  I find it really depressing that the economy has changed from one that produced lumber, refined oil, and exported value added products as well as resources to one that is based on real estate, gambling, and being a playground for visitors.

8143 2018-01-02 05:27:05 Well, in the case of Iran it's quite simple. Because of American and British interefence. Read up about the 1953 Iranian Coup D'etat where the CIA and MI6 overthrew Iran's democratically elected prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, because he wanted to nationalize Iranian oil.

8174 2018-01-02 05:21:06 They recycle oil these days
8175 2018-01-02 05:21:02 Clearly, that’s why regulations for drilling oil here have been removed, keystone pipeline approved, and ANWR opened up. Wait, that doesn’t make sense. Weird.
8176 2018-01-02 05:20:55 Considering Obama has also been silent on the #IranProtests it's quite reasonable to suspect the mullah oil money might have found its way into some very influential Western pockets. If this is so, it'll give new meaning to the phrase, "dirty politics".

8189 2018-01-02 05:18:24 but we know Trump and Flynn went in and took immediate steps to drop the Sanctions on Russia.  Congress stepped in and stopped them.  Trump’s always about money and this oil deal would bring lots of money.

8195 2018-01-02 05:17:29 Sure, carbon is carbon, but: 1 Oil industry is not treated equally in fed and prov'l policy (e.g., coal being phased on to make room for growth of oil emissions); 2 tar sands ghg/bbl higher than most int'l sources; 3 global oil demand growing is huge prob and we're complicit.

8199 2018-01-02 05:17:14 Nah, the Tantive IV’s hyperdrive was damaged and when they jumped to escape Scarif, it left behind a very specific and unique signature that allowed the Imperials to track the Tantive IV very easily.

8213 2018-01-02 05:14:45 In Canada it’s basically our entire economic plan after the oil crash.
8214 2018-01-02 05:14:39 My mom has been putting squalane oil on my dad's face and his skin is lookin' GOOD. All hail the magic of squalane
8215 2018-01-02 05:14:32 i have 100% virgin coconut oil and i mix it with jojoba, tea tree, peppermint, lemon and rose oil and it’s literally the best thing to happen to my skin
8216 2018-01-02 05:14:31 Seems Trump has given Russia a pass for selling oil to N. Korea.  If HRC was in office, she no doubt would have acted forcifully on it!
8217 2018-01-02 05:14:28 Concept: You are laying in bed. One knee is up. Your wife is coming. There is a blanket resting over you and her side of the bed. A glass bowl a little over half full of olive oil is perched on your knee. She gets into bed.
8218 2018-01-02 05:14:18 Coconut oil for me. Olive oil for Bella.
8219 2018-01-02 05:14:15 We must remember there is a second agenda with Iran.  Their oil is much easier to get to and less expensive than Russia’s oil.  The Exxon oil deal Tillerson made will make much more money if Iran’s oil is made more expensive through Sanctions.  Must drop Russian Sanctions to work
8220 2018-01-02 05:14:10 Go for it and buy lot of olive oil to sell it
8221 2018-01-02 05:14:08 somebody get their grandmothers anointing oil & anoint alabama’s linebacker’s knees and legs bc this is ridiculous lmbo.
8222 2018-01-02 05:13:47 Why? And, I'm not surprised one bit. At this point I think they're after more than just land to put their oil pipeline on. Say, "discovery mineral rights"? (gold, etc)
8223 2018-01-02 05:13:32 $250 dollars is rather pricey when you consider you can just dip the toy in a bucket of coconut oil. :)

8241 2018-01-02 05:10:00 My mom got me an oil diffuser for Christmas and it’s so relaxing
8242 2018-01-02 05:09:59 the winter is not nice to my skin. i already have dry skin & i have to double up on oil for the winter .
8243 2018-01-02 05:09:33 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
8244 2018-01-02 05:09:24 Canadian families do come first  whether we've got oil & gas or not. 
Hopefully this increased demand will bring further prosperity and employment for 2018 and beyond.
8245 2018-01-02 05:09:12 I'm convinced that my mother-in-law's cornbread could clean up oil spills.
8246 2018-01-02 05:09:04 is anyone awake that knws anythin about beard oil n what can help a beard grow ?
8247 2018-01-02 05:08:33 I drink a ton of water, never use soap, cleansers or commercial moisturizers. I only wash w/water & use coconut oil and my skin is great. I just turned 44 & people always think I’m in my early to mid thirties so I think its working.

8250 2018-01-02 05:07:39 Majority Leader. Who wants to see a "government shutdown" . An oil drilling happen in the Arctic peninsula. With temporary tax for middle-class and permanent for corporate relief. Because, this is what our President did and more
8251 2018-01-02 05:06:46 Damn! And I thought I had it bad. My car is leaking oil such that I'm having to check it constantly until I can repair it. Hang in there!
8252 2018-01-02 05:06:40 TSA took my razor, my coconut oil, and my toner so please excuse my dry, unshaven legs and huge face pores

8258 2018-01-02 05:04:39 @GenaseePost : oil.  Me: what? G: sometimes I can’t say that word so I just say it sometimes to make sure I can. Oh......
8259 2018-01-02 05:04:38 hey @unicode, why is there an emoji for a barrel of oil but there's not one for a tooth?
8260 2018-01-02 05:04:35 Wow United Arab Emirates dream big! With all that oil cash you think you would be trying to find a cure for cancer or do something productive but no giant ass fireworks are so important for your image.
8261 2018-01-02 05:04:33 @TheRealTriscuit Who was the saint who came up with Rosemary and Olive Oil flavor. I’d like to kiss the chef.
8262 2018-01-02 05:04:27 They really are delicious and with coconut oil and dark chocolate, totally guilt free! 
8263 2018-01-02 05:04:24 After my meeting, I’m going do a refill, oil change, shopping for kaycen, the mall. I got a lot to do.
8264 2018-01-02 05:04:12 Want to dwell for a moment in irony? The oil companies are likely in no hurry to drill, since it would only increase supply without increasing demand. Why spend money to drive prices down? They’ll likely be very picky on buying leases. 

We may have time to fix this.
8265 2018-01-02 05:03:53 Well the problem lies in I make really low calorie popcorn, not very do-able with grease/oil cooked corn lol, I use an air popper, finely ground kosher salt and a powdered popcorn butter. Full popcorn bowl is only like 150 calories
8266 2018-01-02 05:03:30 I'm paying a buck thirty+ for gasoline and $1.05/liter for furnace oil. Who the fuck is making WHAT more expensive??? Sorry...didn't mean to rain on any billionaire oil tycoons' parades...
8267 2018-01-02 05:03:29 brb lemme go purchase this lapis oil from Sephora cuz joeys skin........
8268 2018-01-02 05:03:25 Any excuse will do to jack up the price of oil to line the pockets of the rich.
8269 2018-01-02 05:03:24 The left gets stark raving mad when clean green energy is challenged in anyway as they know oil and coal are here to stay for the foreseeable future now that Trump is undoing all their stacked EPA rules.
8270 2018-01-02 05:03:19 ลบกับไม่ลบ เขาก็ไม่สนใจหรอก
8271 2018-01-02 05:03:10 Thought oil is spread across different parts of d world- Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Venezuela, Saudi, Nordic area, etc.  Are they of d same trading league with Dubai?!!
8272 2018-01-02 05:03:02 年明けまで寝ます
8273 2018-01-02 05:02:33 Rex Tillerson is an oil man and had an oil drilling deal with Russia that was put on hold due to Obama’s sanctions put in place for interfering with the 2016 elections...Putin wants that oil and that’s why Trump will support drilling there

8275 2018-01-02 05:02:23 My moms woulda been tossing oil at the front lol
8276 2018-01-02 05:02:19 Global oil demand is growing.

Why not take an equal view of all sources of emissions in Canada?

We’ve been a leader since 2007 in emissions regulations of the world’s top oil reserve countries, and yet protestors continue to ignore other countries with higher emissions...

8278 2018-01-02 05:02:11 To hell with your aid, we don't need any. It's US who attacked countries in the name of terrorism, rob all their wealth (gold, oil everything) & then keep giving little help to the ppl whose wealth they have looted.

8288 2018-01-02 05:00:45 The lack of response makes me wonder if the purpose is to run a oil pipeline from Venezuela to Puerto Rico.

8314 2018-01-02 04:56:27 Had a near accident driving the other day, no one hurt, car just spun out a bit on a roundabout, did a 180. Raining and oil on the road... has me a bit out of sorts atm tho.

8326 2018-01-02 04:54:33 It will not happen for geopolitical reasons alone. The oil coming from the Persian Gulf supersedes all the platitudes abt "freedom".
8327 2018-01-02 04:54:30 I have thought for a while now that we and allies are preparing to use oil as a diplomatic weapon namely to move Russia out of ME/Syria. I predict if he isn’t out by end of week we will start to flood mkt and drive under 10bbl. Threatening his election prospects.

8345 2018-01-02 04:51:38 So Panama got caught trying to give or sell oil to North Korea?  #Stupid. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump gonna light their ass up.
8346 2018-01-02 04:51:23 The squeaky wheel gets the oil. Happy New Year!!
8347 2018-01-02 04:50:55 Decided to take a career quiz. My top 5 options were as followed:
1. Air Traffic Controller
2. Golfer
3. Football Manager
4. Surgeon
5. Oil Tycoon 

So, safe to say, I have a lot of questions and not a lot of answers.
8348 2018-01-02 04:50:47 犯罪かΣ(O_Oil!) 
8349 2018-01-02 04:50:37 So disturbing. Clear proof that the oil industry and US government knew and knowingly decided their profits were more important. Time for a class action to bring them down is long since passed.

8351 2018-01-02 04:50:21 Rowyn seen me giving Mallory a hot oil foot rub and made me give her one too 
8352 2018-01-02 04:50:13 Nothing boost your testosterone like getting your hands full of oil and gasoline’s sillage.
8353 2018-01-02 04:50:07 Oil?
8354 2018-01-02 04:49:54 @giosflyingpizza when they don’t reply because they know they always forget my bread and oil.
8355 2018-01-02 04:49:42 Did some contractor abandon the Muhoroni bridge? @ntsa_kenya @Ma3Route an accident will soon happen there then we start sprinkling some unknown oil eti prayers.
8356 2018-01-02 04:49:41 It's such a fine line. Radicals will lie to keep Muslim radicals either way we turn. Muslims blame ALL intervening on oil and lying b.s..

8358 2018-01-02 04:49:04 Been using that wild growth oil & all i been seeing is dandruff
8359 2018-01-02 04:49:04 But they have to borrow to feed their habit of drilling and completing tight oil.  Check out @aeberman12
8360 2018-01-02 04:48:57 Hello, is it me you're looking for and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
8361 2018-01-02 04:48:46 I have a wax melter and an oil defuser does this mean I'm an adult now?
8362 2018-01-02 04:48:35 There is No Global Warming. Stop been such a sheep and follow all the scientists. Remember when Scientists predicted PEAK OIL. How did that turn out?
8363 2018-01-02 04:48:05 So much to look forward to.  Hau 'oil Makahiki Hou 2018!
8364 2018-01-02 04:47:47 My essential oil obsession is kinda getting out of hand 
8365 2018-01-02 04:47:45 As my recently purchased SUVs engine has blown up today, let’s just say I doubled my usual dose of lavender essential oil this evening
8366 2018-01-02 04:47:31 I want an oil diffuser
8367 2018-01-02 04:47:29 If 15 protesters have been killed by the Iranian government it stands to reason that 15 Iranian oil rigs should be sunk with torpedoes individaully labeled with the names of each protester.

8368 2018-01-02 04:47:09 Did you even study science in sch? Y don't u want 2 understand the truth? Can't put your head in sand; it w/happen anyway. Pls, 4 the sake of our country, try 2 understand how climate chg is affecting us. Oil profits won't matter if we all die.
8369 2018-01-02 04:46:57 Great cause that’s how we pregame. Looks like you’ll be playing it with us before the spring oil spill.
8370 2018-01-02 04:46:55 They don’t.  It’s called a spread.  The arbitrage (trans Atlantic) governs which direction oil travels.  High RVP “oil” (this is shale oil) cannot be transported neat this way.  It has to be blended.
8371 2018-01-02 04:46:34 Is the Chili Bowl gonna be live on the Lucas Oil Tv App ??
8372 2018-01-02 04:46:26 Well...we had the right to their natural resources. Duh. Their oil. Their poppy fields. We need opium for our drugs. We earned it because we are America and they aren’t. Cmon now.
8373 2018-01-02 04:46:15 I live in a older home built at the height of the 70-80's oil boom in Texas. They made them big and relatively inexpensive compared to other cities. Drafty and cold.  My heating bill is going to be a fortune...
8374 2018-01-02 04:46:01 perhaps a lean toward USA-sourced coal versus imported oil.
8375 2018-01-02 04:45:58 Yes because I make time. Most people don’t and das okay. They can enjoy their coconut oil
8376 2018-01-02 04:45:27 The fact that a natural oil works better as an anti depressant that made me gain 10 pounds and made me a monster for a month when I got off of it blows my mind
8377 2018-01-02 04:45:18 Yet you don’t say a thing about Russia giving oil to North Korea!!! Wtf!! Smdh
8378 2018-01-02 04:44:53 Pixi Rose Blend oil is what I've been loving, it soaks right in and isn't greasy at all.
8379 2018-01-02 04:44:37 I just spent $32 on a groupon for an oil change and car wash... what a deal. Technology is amazing these days. Use it right people.
8380 2018-01-02 04:44:33 We used to have a cool daddy, but me and my brother kept forgetting to change the oil. Now we have got an air daddy for Christmas
8381 2018-01-02 04:44:24 Is it for the rest of your life or you take it for a few months?? I might risk it because my skin produces a lot of oil,,,,,,, and I don't plan on having kids either so it's no big deal.
8382 2018-01-02 04:44:20 I dead ass moisturize everything on my body. Coconut oil for my nana and my feet. Castor oil for my hair/eyebrows. Rosehip/argan oil for my face. Cocoa butter for everything else.
8383 2018-01-02 04:44:17 Woman changes her own oil. Gotta respect that
8384 2018-01-02 04:44:15 Ok yeah I’m def gonna have to try an oil bc I’ve tried so much moisturizer. Might give up tbh
8385 2018-01-02 04:44:08 Criminals and lib policies.
8386 2018-01-02 04:44:05 Exfoliation is key for removing blemishes. Just be sure not to agitate any existing acne and always moisturize after. Tea tree oil is also an excellent antifungal and anti microbial . Helped clear up my skin
8387 2018-01-02 04:43:39 THAT was Klein who deregulated & sold off public assets to pay the bloated debt that the PCs accumulated through 40 years of mismanagement. The cons have sucked out or given away all of AB oil revenue. The last decent PC was Lougheed - I dare you to name another of equal stature.
8388 2018-01-02 04:43:29 Me feel fi a rub dung wid coconut oil
8389 2018-01-02 04:43:10 Chef McElroy cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with hot sauce.
8390 2018-01-02 04:43:10 This weekend, try oil pulling while wearing a hematite bracelet.
8391 2018-01-02 04:43:10 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
8392 2018-01-02 04:43:07 If NK attacks SK then we're in it. There are mutual defense treaties. Russia & China are not cooperating with Trump. Even Trump found out China is selling NK oil. China is afraid to lose NK because they don't want a strong Korea
8393 2018-01-02 04:42:37 You could try oiling it with coconut oil , tea tree or carrot oil too see if that help or may have to try different kinds of braiding hair
8394 2018-01-02 04:42:32 The Lord has sent me to create the mourners of Zion, that they are given the spirit of heaviness beauty for ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, beautiful clothes.

8395 2018-01-02 04:42:13 Gen corruption & bad governance, mlitancy in ND are ALL symptoms 
of the Resource Curse which the FG's myopic reliance on oil rents has induced in NG States.

Restructuring back to the Federal basis of the NG union is cure-all for a thieving FG.enabed by Constitution of slavery
8396 2018-01-02 04:41:49 Q:Will WTI OIL go short?AW: yes

(Your rhythm lacked a little balance. FIFY. 
8399 2018-01-02 04:41:14 I’m betting Trump already has a plan that includes China and South Korea. I personally think this is a distraction, so was the oil tanker this week. Trump needs the media focused elsewhere while he starts cleaning up here! It’s about #MAGA
8400 2018-01-02 04:41:11 But only if you covered in oil with long hair and what not
8401 2018-01-02 04:41:09 Know that ANY deal made on immigration will be taken into the courts by dems. Keep that in mind.
8402 2018-01-02 04:40:48 @gorka_marquezRP  hates olbas oil
8403 2018-01-02 04:40:39 only calls in crude oil wait guys our target only 10 points
8404 2018-01-02 04:40:32 I recommend also cutting out sugar, alcohol, and bad oils, but adding in lots of yoga, CBD oil from cannabis, and eating a plant based diet.

Breitbart wants flashy annihilation; to WayneTracker, the planet's climate active children are all the enemy, to be quietly...

8411 2018-01-02 04:39:09 Isn't Russia supplying N.Korea with oil, too? Anything being saidm about that? Aren't they allies? N. KOREA, CHINA and RUSSIA?
8412 2018-01-02 04:38:52 All these people talking about oil diffusers being the big gift this Christmas

Idk what exactly that is but it sounds like it'd just make me feel greasy
8413 2018-01-02 04:38:42 i rubbed raw coconut oil all over myself after my shower (like i always do) and now my dog won’t stop trying to lick me 
8414 2018-01-02 04:38:06 3 color challenge, or oil pastels

8416 2018-01-02 04:37:34 Have you use tea tree oil? When my scalp breaks out that usually helps
8417 2018-01-02 04:37:32 Ima be out the door at 9am getting a oil change

8426 2018-01-02 04:35:20 "Which vegetables is vegetable oil made from? Corn?"
8427 2018-01-02 04:35:17 i went to a dermatologist and got on a medication called accutane, it reduces the amount of oil released by oil glands in your skin, and helps your skin renew itself more quickly. it's a bit expensive about $90 a month for both doc follow up and medication but worth the long term
8428 2018-01-02 04:35:08 俺も批判するだけで金貰いてえなぁ〜
8429 2018-01-02 04:34:49 Stay away from coconut oil as it is a comedogenic oil and clogs pores. I use a serum with salicylic acid in b/c it is good for acne and serums are absorbed easier into the skin than creams
8430 2018-01-02 04:34:46 Ima go buy me a oil pen n call it a nite
8431 2018-01-02 04:34:27 Covered in coconut oil, wearing my favorite sweatpants, and smothered in my three favorite blankets plus the quilt my grandma made.

8437 2018-01-02 04:33:24 Is wild growth hair oil good?
8438 2018-01-02 04:33:15 At that time price of crude oil was above 100$ per barrel.but last two year crude oil was nearly 45$per barrel.kindly educate us fiscal deficit   with this dimension.
8439 2018-01-02 04:33:09 It’s North Dakota. We just trade oil and potatoes with each other, bud.
8440 2018-01-02 04:32:53 The brand!! Or just regular shea butter? I use coconut oil but I’ve noticed it makes my skin too oily
8441 2018-01-02 04:32:28 Idk, while I've very much enjoyed his insight and content it seems more like he's selling snake oil nowadays. Bitcoin, t shirts, and bobs.
8442 2018-01-02 04:32:23 Oil change & detail tomorrow thanks baby 
8443 2018-01-02 04:32:20 In last month #China & #Russia caught sending oil to #NorthKorea... #UNsanction violations... punishments... NOTHING!  It is what it is.
8444 2018-01-02 04:32:19 So the oil filter would be a glorious failure.
8445 2018-01-02 04:32:12 If the seven sisters leave iraq and its petrol alone.. i see iraq going far not only for this year but for the coming centuries...Iraq US is not helping its helping its american based petroleum companies who grabbed the oil of iraq afterThe sadam regime
8446 2018-01-02 04:32:08 I hope all you oil field workers and coal miners and farmers and everyone who voted for trump because he wasn't a politician and because you didn't want a woman to be president and your resented Obama are really proud now. Your families will pay the price

8449 2018-01-02 04:31:58 Because we have such great cooperation and trust them so much to be able to verify applicants identities?
8450 2018-01-02 04:31:57 I haven't noticed any increase in the number of people listening to my music.  I'm going to tweet about Turkish oil wrestling.  It's the national sport where guys wear leather shorts, douse themselves in olive oil and try to get their hands in the other guy's pants.
8451 2018-01-02 04:31:47 I hate working with greasy food because I feel like I am absorbing the oil and gaining weight
8452 2018-01-02 04:31:45 It was a fundraiser at today's Oil King's game.
8453 2018-01-02 04:31:35 I spilled all of my tea tree oil ... I'm furious broooooo
8454 2018-01-02 04:31:26 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.

8460 2018-01-02 04:30:23 So thats why u indians are now in panic that Pakistan is going to be strong after CPEC and exploration of Gas and Oil reserves and trades

8462 2018-01-02 04:30:08 The maitake and brown beech I just stuck in the oven with olive oil and salt, and those were great.
8463 2018-01-02 04:30:06 We had a mouse. So we asked it how to get rid of mice and it suggested this flower oil. And then we asked if it was harmful to animals. And it said toxic to cats
8464 2018-01-02 04:29:49 They have,it was explained that the chance of mixing plastic with biodegradable plastic was too great,so they gave the oil companies preference over bio degradable coffee cup,bags and containers IDIOTS!
8465 2018-01-02 04:29:37 Have to get a oil change tmro & it’s just to cold for it .
8466 2018-01-02 04:29:15 I added lavender oil to my diffuser and now I feel like throwing up
8467 2018-01-02 04:28:55 got a full tank of gas and I'm 3000 miles overdue for an oil change. what about it
8468 2018-01-02 04:28:33 Diffusing straight tea tree oil is so nice! I love when the apartment is freshly cleaned.
8469 2018-01-02 04:28:22 I like the metaphor of desperate people at the carnival crowded around the snake oil salesman. For their problems, there is no cure, no hope, no Jesus. But here is this smart talking guy with this magical miracle stuff... 

Sure, it's wishful thinking, but that's all they've got.
8470 2018-01-02 04:27:57 Ok.  I look forward to the day that I see Countries paying off $ loans with oil priced at $100 and the DXY priced at 50.
8471 2018-01-02 04:26:23 Unlike you, I AM an educated voter and I know that when it comes to foreign policy and economic policy, there's little-to-no difference between the parties. They all murder civilians. They all cave to oil companies and they all cater to the banks.
8472 2018-01-02 04:25:59 do I scrub with the almond oil then rinse and then put toner or don't rinse and just add toner? Can't find the video.
8473 2018-01-02 04:25:59 So we're loaning (?) this oil producer 100m to buy our airplanes. Or does "finance" mean in reality that these airplanes were sold for only 20% of their value?
8474 2018-01-02 04:25:53 NO OIL NO CARS OR TRUCKS , NO OIL NO PLASTICS , NO OIL NO FOOD , NO OIL  NO REFRIGERATION , NO OIL  NO WATER  ,GET THE PICTURE !
8475 2018-01-02 04:25:52 I think I had the worst tasting fish this week, we all know that fish is fried or grilled, looks like this one was boiled, I think they done that for the sake of healthy, I think they never headed of olive oil.

8478 2018-01-02 04:25:29 No, they're arbitraging the gross underpricing of commodities rel to incipient USD supplies by swapping USD's today for future phys supplies of oil, going out a long time.  After china controls enough phys supplies of commodities, then they control the int'l trade value of USD

8492 2018-01-02 04:24:10 US-Israel s agenda is to destabilize Iran either from inside or by conflicts. Iran has huge oil/gas reserves in the world.literally, they can manage their economy if the US didn't impose sanctions. I agree Iran needs a more moderate law.
8493 2018-01-02 04:24:09 I must admit I did have the pleasure of some threads that I got blocked from by posting actual .gov executive orders that contradicted what they were saying...like the one that said they were giving the Bears Ears land for mining & oil, not to the people, like they argued.
8494 2018-01-02 04:23:03 So your great reasoning skills gave us a "president" who makes a deal with our nation's sworn enemy to try to get a slice of a Russian oil and gas deal worth $500 BILLION to Putin. 

Why do you think Trump's SecOfState, the CEO of ExxonMobil, had a Friendship Medal from Putin?
8495 2018-01-02 04:22:58 Obsessed with my oil diffuser 
8496 2018-01-02 04:22:46 Baby oil is really my favorite
8497 2018-01-02 04:22:43 Pooling and sharing? Don't make me laugh. They charge Scotland more for electricity connection,they charged millions of vat 're police, lies 're ship building, HMRC JOB losses, military bases closures, 40+ years of oil and Scotland has food banks! Get a grip!!
8498 2018-01-02 04:22:38 Truth is always like oil in water.
No matter how much water u add, oil always floats on "TOP"

8511 2018-01-02 04:19:52 No one should pay.oil revenues will take care of it
8512 2018-01-02 04:19:48 My friend did a twist out on my other friends hair and HER HAIR FROZE all they had was coconut oil and water and her hair froze 
8513 2018-01-02 04:19:48 Well, it's only taken six months and a variety of penetrating oils and localized heating plus gravity to get that one head off, WITH a custom tool to apply even pressure. That motor ran 53 miles after full service but 2 decades sitting before loosing oil pressure
8514 2018-01-02 04:19:42 I will take a look this week.
I used to work in the area and there's been quite a few "snake oil" salespeople.
Some of the basic concepts are true, but there's been a lot of hyperbole.
8515 2018-01-02 04:19:41 Fat-free yogurt - yuck! And I get my tuna canned in olive oil, much tastier!
8516 2018-01-02 04:19:40 Why US not winning war in Afghanistan after 15 years?? 1. $600 Billion Heroin income 2. Part of missile ring around Russia 3. Afghani massive natural resources 4. Oil from Azerbaijan 5. Can invade Iran when ready. 6. Training Al Qaeda/ISIS . LIE TO US PUBLIC!
8517 2018-01-02 04:19:26 Yes they are doing it NOW because the dollar still has value and is in short supply. In YOUR scenario the dollar is worthless and no one wants it.  At THAT point they will not repay $ loans in oil but in worthless dollars.

8521 2018-01-02 04:19:17 Lier!!! The jobs created are temporary! When the pipeline breaks it's a pollution disaster. China is crushing us in developing renewable energy. Here we are in the stone age wasting time on oil. You won't be happy until this planet is uninhabitable.
8522 2018-01-02 04:19:08 Because if they just do that, they'll always be under washingtons thumb.  US entitlement + federal debt = 80 yrs of 100% of global oil supplies.  Instead China's using USD's to lock up future oil supplies for china...essentially "you take the USD's, we'll take the oil"...

8544 2018-01-02 04:16:40 My newest painting will be mind-blowing.
All of the same aspects and innovations, except this one will be acrylic and oil.
Plus it will glow-in-the-dark...
8545 2018-01-02 04:16:14 Good! That was my only concern. And I didn’t have goo gone on hand. I remembered that goo gone is basically an oil so I tried this and it worked great! It even makes the cover so clean it shines! 
I used to just rub it off by hand and it took forever! 
8546 2018-01-02 04:15:50 Nothing better than a black girl with her natural curly hair smelling like cocoa butter and coconut oil

Try it all, depression is best treated with a combo approach. Hope that helps.
8551 2018-01-02 04:15:03 Allspice is very uplifting, it increases energy and determination making it useful in many different types of spells, especially healing spells.
The dried berries, oil, or allspice incense can be burned to aid in spells for attracting money and/or luck.
8552 2018-01-02 04:15:00 Sometimes I feel hella pretty when I get off work because my face is like glowing, but then I remember that’s literally oil and grease all over my body.

8596 2018-01-02 04:07:05 Rig count is really geared to Price right now.  Spending will stop on a dime if oil falls. It’s all about earnings now vs reserve growth.
8597 2018-01-02 04:06:59 Governing use of oil back then was not for transport, but oil was still on the market.
8598 2018-01-02 04:06:47 Seriously. At least a nice gloss of olive oil to make it look a little bit appetizing. I call it maga chicken

8608 2018-01-02 04:05:30 There's been some work done by @slpng_giants to get advertisers to withdraw from quasi-state propaganda outlets like Breitbart & Fox News. Saudi oil would be a longer-term thing.

8617 2018-01-02 04:03:57 its pointless to compare the "real value" of oil in 1861 when no one used an internal combustion engine
8618 2018-01-02 04:03:51 Which are ridiculous, inequitably punitive to upstream oil and gas, and unlikely to be matched by ANY other country. Not to even open the discussion on whether climate change caused by humans is material, or is even real. That honest enough for you.

8630 2018-01-02 04:01:52 กูต้องกินหอยเยอะไปแน่ๆ
8631 2018-01-02 04:01:36 With all the oil in the middle east, WHY is the USA sending our money there.
8632 2018-01-02 04:01:29 Haah I pakai shade 23 tp VTxBTS ni shade 21. Too white for me..but after blotted out the oil..it doesn’t look too white on my face.
8633 2018-01-02 04:01:18 Thank you. That sure clears it all up. Whatcha gonna do when there's no oil? #windandsolar
8634 2018-01-02 04:01:11 I'm sorry to hear that. I do got a different bottle of oil to rub you down and make you feel better.
8635 2018-01-02 04:01:11 2/2 I am mostly pointing out that when our government wages war against countries like Pakistan, Yemen, Venezuela, etc, the real reason is to protect the petrodollar and the oligarchs who use it to control the oil supply. It has nothing to do with our long-term well-being.
8636 2018-01-02 04:01:06 Civil unrest, protest, govt crackdowns are happening across globe but the thing to be noted here... Why US has interest in oil rich countries only?
#protest #Iran #IranProtests
8637 2018-01-02 04:00:59 OIL DIFF: 6.85 -> 6.85
8638 2018-01-02 04:00:51 and oil.. olive oil

8641 2018-01-02 04:00:10 OIL DIFF: 6.84 -> 6.86
8642 2018-01-02 04:00:00 Will Iran protests impact oil markets - and other commodity themes to start 2018 - with ANZ's @danielhynes live @SkyBusiness channel 602 shortly #ausbiz
8643 2018-01-02 03:59:51 Intra/ Inter Enterprise communication is still broken. Rather than the generic tools we have now, we're more likely to see industry specific apps. e.g. concept discussion in advertising is different from Oil and Gas engineering
8644 2018-01-02 03:59:45 Me feet are fucking freezing and they feel dry no matter how much lotion and oil I apply. 
8645 2018-01-02 03:59:42 One of the simple home remedies for body odor is to put a few drops of rose water or tea tree oil in the bathtub, before taking bath.
8646 2018-01-02 03:59:38 The story of the ten bridesmaids. Five were foolish and five wasn't the Bible Matthew chapter 25. The five that were foolish had no oil for there lamp the five that did have oil. Means that they had the word of God they read the Bible. Remember that IAM
8647 2018-01-02 03:59:37 I love putting coconut oil on got me looking like a chocolate glazed donut
8648 2018-01-02 03:59:29 まぁ、だからと言って無条件に叩いてよいわけではないぞ
8649 2018-01-02 03:59:03 Just talked about the BP oil spill because, ya know, everyone still cares about it @dtboudreauxx
8650 2018-01-02 03:58:36 Hot oil treatment before bed>>>>
8651 2018-01-02 03:58:30 change oil kay G4 
8652 2018-01-02 03:57:51 i’ve been taking evening primrose oil to prevent ripping / to speed things up a bit, and i’m really curious to see if it works. this is night 2!
8653 2018-01-02 03:57:48 I should’ve rubbed her down in baby oil
8654 2018-01-02 03:57:35 #message Change your oil here at Shrewsbury Carwash M-F and receive a free Classic full service wash voucher. Add a $3.95 a-la-cart Underbody Wash to rinse the salt from the undercarriage
8655 2018-01-02 03:57:28 Pork fat. Vegetable oil would be cannibalism.
8656 2018-01-02 03:57:05 Yup it did make my face look oily. But I blotted out the oil with kitchen towel & then apply loose powder to make it matte. I kinda like it and it suit my skin 
8657 2018-01-02 03:56:56 Yet how many oil spills or drinking water poisonings?
8658 2018-01-02 03:56:34 Rozz is so damn spoiled he refused to eat the food in his bowl all day just because I forgot his coconut oil at home 
8659 2018-01-02 03:56:27 i got tea tree oil in my mouth and now i want to cut my tongue out. help me.
8660 2018-01-02 03:56:22 you’re all about skincare lol. I just bought some cream, an aha cream, & oil cleanser. I really like their products that I’ve used so far
8661 2018-01-02 03:55:45 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
8662 2018-01-02 03:55:41 I don’t make a good first impression with most people because I may have an ego. What they don’t know is I equally have humility. I’m not a snake oil salesman; I’m a good dude.
8663 2018-01-02 03:55:21 i know that vaseline doesnt clog pores you could put it on overnight during the day im sure itd be too shiny , or sometimes when im getting dry i mix pure vitamin E oil into my moisturizer for extra moisture
8664 2018-01-02 03:55:12 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
8665 2018-01-02 03:55:06 Big difference: oil co.s were making money like crazy back then. Now they are close to zero. Shareholders angry. Supply side will be slow to react.
8666 2018-01-02 03:54:56 yes ..we still have volition to allow the planet not to descend into endless actual war for land and resource that is starting to manifest (oil wars aside)
8667 2018-01-02 03:54:54 I stop seeing things when I look at them too long
I think that's normal, but in certain circumstances that can really mess you up
8668 2018-01-02 03:54:46 Cut it in half, get rid of seeds, oil it, s&p, flip it over on a cookie sheet, 375 degrees for 40-50 minutes, shred with a fork when done.
8669 2018-01-02 03:54:43 St. John's Wort is associated with St. John the Baptist. It was gathered on St. John's Day and soaked in olive oil to create an anointing oil called the "Blood of Christ". It is said that the red sap "bleeds" in August on the day when St. John was beheaded.
8670 2018-01-02 03:54:24 Oil money.
8671 2018-01-02 03:54:23 The current SA govt is an "ally" as long as we buy their oil (& they buy our weapons) & we don't ask them difficult questions such as: what exactly IS the difference between the way you apply Sharia law & the way Isis does it? 
We are their 'useful idiots' in the Dar-al-harb...
8672 2018-01-02 03:54:05 Unless, like I'm stuck getting an oil change or at the emergency room and they have one of those TVs that can only be changed with a remote and the remote is lost and it was already on when I got there...
8673 2018-01-02 03:52:43 Did you say UAE has no oil?
8674 2018-01-02 03:52:30 One more day off 2ma... clean up the crib ...get an oil change n wash clothes for the week.... get ready for the check chasing
8675 2018-01-02 03:52:23 Buy #Electricvehicles go #SolarPower , stop being the pawns of oil companies.
8676 2018-01-02 03:51:43 I put tea tree oil on my cat once - bc a website listed it as a holistic ANIMAL-SAFE treatment for ringworm - and I literally almost killed him. I had no idea it’s one of the most toxic things for cats

Reminder to always check with your vet before utilizing holistic treatments
8677 2018-01-02 03:51:31 And a oil can for your joints!!!
8678 2018-01-02 03:51:29 Tony: Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there any longer so you gotta let go. Pepper, please let go! I'll catch you, I promise! 
*fails to catch Pepper*
Pepper: *falls 200ft into a burning oil rig*

8680 2018-01-02 03:50:59 一緒に頑張りましょう☺︎
8681 2018-01-02 03:50:35 趣味もそうですが、お仕事関連等でも、ホビーイベントの方が比率が高いので、同人誌製作の方に皺寄せが来るため、余り適当になるのも辛いので、ホビーイベントを優先致しました(^^;
8682 2018-01-02 03:50:32 Yes, I personally allow all my tastes to be defined by pretentious reviews, which is why I drink my coffee with truffle oil and only bathe in Napa Valley wine with a nose that has notes of blackberry and charred oak.
8683 2018-01-02 03:50:16 And yet...still contributing to the military effort to kill civilians for oil. 

The whole point, though, is - what kind of country do we live in, that that’s the only option for people to support themselves? And as someone else said, what about those who don’t qualify?
8684 2018-01-02 03:50:12 If it was possible in 2018 to be healthier taking a few drops of cbd oil every day would you try it ?
8685 2018-01-02 03:50:09 Coconut oil to some of us causes acne
8686 2018-01-02 03:50:03 Depression does something so strange to your sense of taste, it makes everything mundane. It takes away every extra connection the food had, you can't even remember that butter and sugar and chocolate create something you enjoy. All you taste is oil and sugar and cooked wheat.
8687 2018-01-02 03:50:02 I use primer solely to the purpose of minimizing my pores and attempting to help with oil control
8688 2018-01-02 03:49:53 Hahahha mercy. I’ll get the holy oil lol
8689 2018-01-02 03:49:46 July 11, 2008 oil hits 147 per Barrell intraday. Iran oil production is worth paying attention to.
8690 2018-01-02 03:49:46 Wild hair grow , doo gro growth oil , castro oil & Dont let products build up around your edges
8691 2018-01-02 03:49:43 fresh out the shower baby oil smell > if that make sense 
8692 2018-01-02 03:49:38 I’m fresh out or I would’ve  but you just reminded me that I have magnesium spray and an essential oil that’s suppose to help headaches
8693 2018-01-02 03:49:33 Oil change apt at 830am let's see how long this takes tomorrow smh
8694 2018-01-02 03:49:14 A mistake made at 22 is something like not changing your car oil when it needs it. Not fucking showing a dead person on a YouTube video. He had the time from filming to editing to uploading to ask "is this a good idea" and he didn't. This wasn't a mistake it was intentional
8695 2018-01-02 03:49:13 Greed will eventually destroy the human race. No technology works in a closed self sustaining  system.Per unit of energy spent to extract per gallon of oil is increasing.Economic progress is becoming unsustainable. Economic exploitation of natural resources is doing no good
8696 2018-01-02 03:49:07 ヤバ진짜?진짜?

8698 2018-01-02 03:48:49 I make my chocolate cakes with coconut oil instead of butter. Makes them yummy.
8699 2018-01-02 03:48:41 I have the entire collection. The body oil, scrub, butter, wash, and body mist 
8700 2018-01-02 03:48:39 **sorry 1/4 c veg oil**
8701 2018-01-02 03:48:27 Coconut oil be having me glowing at the right times
8702 2018-01-02 03:47:58 Absolutely true.  It is not the right type of oil.
8703 2018-01-02 03:47:56 Tried then someone told me not to cause the oil from the peanut butter let’s me walk right off it. So I put peanut butter on the wooden traps. Still nothing

8707 2018-01-02 03:46:43 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
8708 2018-01-02 03:46:41 1回めちゃくちゃ髭伸ばしてみたい
8709 2018-01-02 03:46:37 "Oil? Oil?? What bitch you cookin'?"
8710 2018-01-02 03:46:32 Like how I’ve spent hours simply trying to kill bandits in Assassin’s Creed Origins by shooting arrows at oil jars? 

I AM AN ADULT AND THIS IS A PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE USE OF MY TIME
8711 2018-01-02 03:46:31 I'm gonna try some of that Nablus olive oil soap soon.
8712 2018-01-02 03:46:26 @CarmenYulinCruz It would not surprise me if they don't find some treasure or perhaps oil in the island.  Take into account that the ground and rivers were shaken vigorously so let's see what happen. God bless my island.
8713 2018-01-02 03:46:21 @RealitySteve  I follow a few from this franchise.  And 1 by 1 delete them.  My question, is there anything that Jade and Tanner don't/won't promote on their sites?  Yikes!  Every day something new they are pushing with their codes.  Couple of snake oil sales people.
8714 2018-01-02 03:46:19 I’m also holding SP3 which is a small security camera/surveillance company currently developing LIDAR technology for their cameras to be used on major oil & gas projects. Any sniff of a large contract will see their share price rocket
8715 2018-01-02 03:46:10 知らぬ間です( ᵒ̴̶̷᷄ д ᵒ̴̶̷᷅ )
8716 2018-01-02 03:45:59 I need some castor oil my skin does not really like this coconut oil it be dry the next morning
8717 2018-01-02 03:45:56 @neiltyson Neon Taster, I think
8718 2018-01-02 03:45:52 Trump being elected was in response to snake oil salesman Obama's abuse & pure hate for America & Americans. #MAGA
8719 2018-01-02 03:45:49 It's gone!!! It was decomposing right on top of the lightbulb behind my ceiling cover. Uggggh . 

Put my oil burner on and having a wine
8720 2018-01-02 03:45:46 Currently, 40-50% of oil products are fuels (gasoline, diesel, nafta, etc.) that are used principally on ground transportation, so #EV could change significantly oil market reducing CO2 emissions. Now the question is how oil industry will react on this?
8721 2018-01-02 03:45:44 No sir, that will take time. Pero less breakouts, smaller pores and less oil.
8722 2018-01-02 03:45:26 Chicken alfredo is oil 
8723 2018-01-02 03:45:06 เฮ้อ
8724 2018-01-02 03:45:05 I kind of get a kick out of observing which storefronts here remain since growing up. The comic book store. The natural foods store. I'm out of that nice petitgrain oil, I figure I'll try that shop for it.
8725 2018-01-02 03:44:45 Coconut oil >>>>> 
8726 2018-01-02 03:44:40 Grantiae peeling cream & moisturizing cream & also the bare minerals skin-volumizing oil serum & the bare minerals oil-free replenishing gel cream 
8727 2018-01-02 03:44:31 It may not be the right type of oil. #heavy.
8728 2018-01-02 03:44:27 Para uso diario es preferible polvo suelto, porque obstruye menos tus poros de un compacto. Que también podrías hacer uso de una cc cream y mantener tu piel fresca y sellado con el polvo traslúcido o suelto oil free
8729 2018-01-02 03:44:16 Oil prices had their highest January opening since 2014, with Brent and WTI crude prices rising to mid-2015 highs, supported by ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia as well as strong demand.
8730 2018-01-02 03:44:16 Any chance you could get some smokeless tea lights before the storm hits  (IKEA always has them; supermarkets often too). They generate heat, but way less smoke than an oil lamp.
8731 2018-01-02 03:44:12 You can see the little beads of oil and the smell is lovely
8732 2018-01-02 03:44:09 イゴローナクは確かに人型に見える…？
8733 2018-01-02 03:44:05 Holy fuck in oil country none the less
8734 2018-01-02 03:43:57 Anybody got any good homemade deep conditioner ideas that don’t require coconut oil??? I just genuinely feel like it does absolutely nothing for my hair
8735 2018-01-02 03:43:57 A Russian says to a bankrupt American, “you should run for President. Since you owe me so much money, I’ll help, but you work for me, and you have to make sure to rattle North Korea.”

Then the Russian said to a North Korean, “hey, that American is scary. Buy my oil and weapons.”
8736 2018-01-02 03:43:51 monthly chart on energy stocks and oil has broken out - maybe a retest to start yr. old resistance = new support. but setup is bullish imo.
8737 2018-01-02 03:43:47 ７月１０日はオイルの日。

「７１０」を逆さにすると「ＯＩＬ」に見えるから。

OIL！
8738 2018-01-02 03:43:31 guess what dumbass scalded her hand w burning ht oil?????
8739 2018-01-02 03:43:09 Why when we opened up Alaska for drilling or the Marcellus shale reserve from North Dakota to PA? Oil is at 56 dollars a barrel nobody is drilling.
8740 2018-01-02 03:42:55 Vanilla & almond oil x B&BW.
8741 2018-01-02 03:42:42 Capitalism gives you choices even grow your own. Socialism fails every time it’s tried when they run out of other peoples money, ask the Venezuelans they sit on the worlds richest oil reserves,they are starving eating dogs,cats, and zoo animals
8742 2018-01-02 03:42:21 Sauerkraut sucks.  Let’s all just agree on that.  I took all the water out of it, added @FranksRedHot , pepper, garlic and seared it in oil.  Way better and I get good luck
8743 2018-01-02 03:41:57 Mr.Trump as we all know for USA there is only one GOD which is ( Gold, Oil, Diamonds ) & that's what you seek and take by attacking weak countries.
So stop blaming and Do More to make up for your Mistakes as it is NO MORE from Pakistan.  #DonaldTrump
8744 2018-01-02 03:41:26 I stick to my Dove I just bought the dry oil moisture one so far I’ve been pleased I don’t try to use too many different body washes
8745 2018-01-02 03:41:04 I was away from home for 3 days lost 2 Alex & Ani’s, A big bottle of witch hazel, headphones, and baby oil gel. Wow.
8746 2018-01-02 03:40:24 すっかりバルカロールも寒くなったなー。へくしっ

8748 2018-01-02 03:39:52 you better get you some witch hazel toner and vitamin E oil and call it a day.
8749 2018-01-02 03:39:47 Another ship seized, suspected of violating international sanctions by supplying oil to North Korea. Is a naval blockade of North Korea in the works? @MichaelGWaltz to discuss 11 ET @foxnewsnight

8753 2018-01-02 03:39:17 Well tonight is a struggle... Tried to dump the extra oil off my in progress frittata, but I'm pretty sure that was actually just the egg..... smh
8754 2018-01-02 03:39:14 Trump is not part of Big Oil. That is an enormous plus.
8755 2018-01-02 03:39:02 So, are we now to presume that protests in Iranian cities will lead to higher oil prices? Got it…
8756 2018-01-02 03:38:51 Welp, few things I'll be perfecting on the next batch. Like, remembering to use titanium dioxide for the white part of the soap and ADD FRAGRANCE OIL NEXT TIME. Also, better placement of the crystals and letting the soap dry before adding the light gold mica on top.

8760 2018-01-02 03:38:07 Why extract any oil at all?  We have massive oil reserves in Louisiana.
8761 2018-01-02 03:38:02 I personally prefer the extra sexperienced olive oil.
8762 2018-01-02 03:37:55 Coconut oil and lavender infused shea butter for the win
8763 2018-01-02 03:37:39 I’m now one of those oil diffusing people and i honestly couldn’t be happier about it
8764 2018-01-02 03:37:22 Carbon credits are the best possible approach. Do nothing and our oil doesn't get sold as the rest of the world moves past us. Funny that you don't question the vast industry money creating the scam of climate denialism. You've been bought and too dumb to know it.

8770 2018-01-02 03:36:04 Last night, I made my 1st batch of weed oil. I ground up the last of my 2017 shake & did the whole pot/oil/strain 4 hour process....and made a Peaches n Kreme cake for the NYE. Turned out amazing & everyone was High AF!

8775 2018-01-02 03:35:18 Edward Teller was darling of conservatives.  Oil execs didn’t ignore him because he was wrong but because considering catastrophic damage to humanity was “inconvenient and unprofitable”. . . even when a friend says it. What’s more cynical except us ignoring it?  #DefendClimate
8776 2018-01-02 03:35:13 A delicious spin on one of my faves. Rosemary and grapefruit oil sounds divine...
8777 2018-01-02 03:35:12 2018 is truly going to be great because I finally used coconut oil as a makeup remover, and I have discovered the best part of being human.
8778 2018-01-02 03:35:09 The Dossier says Russians paid for a trip for Michael Flynn. That is a fact.

It says former Trump Adviser Carter Page was in Russia multiple times during & after the campaign. That is a fact.

It says Page met with Russian oil company Rosneft. That is another fact.

8783 2018-01-02 03:34:34 Oil prices had their highest January opening since 2014, with Brent and WTI crude prices rising to mid-2015 highs, supported by ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia as well as strong demand.
8784 2018-01-02 03:34:23 I finally got an oil diffuser and would looveeeee to hear what your faves are!

8787 2018-01-02 03:33:59 Jimmy Carter, Naval Academy graduate, was a socialist?   Please explain how Carter caused the oil crisis.  Carter was a lousy president but you miss the mark on both of these opinions.  This is exactly why intellectual honesty is so important
8788 2018-01-02 03:33:53 I drunk organic apple juice with a table spoon of extra virgin olive oil. It says will keep your liver clean. But it taste like oily apple juice.

8796 2018-01-02 03:33:04 My mom makes kind of a bean salsa/ salad with black eyed peas. I think with oil and vinegar and cilantro ... things like that
8797 2018-01-02 03:33:00 Don’t look now but a wife and her husband just went to pho with her parents and her dad (never goes to pho) squeezed the lime all over the bean sprouts and jalapeños then dipped it in a mixture of sambal, sriracha, hoisin and chili oil and proceeded to eat it like an appetizer.
8798 2018-01-02 03:32:54 Seems that now US has eye on their oil reserves and from there you people want to destabilize CPEC

8811 2018-01-02 03:31:04 I have no rosemary here, nor grapefruit oil to express. But soon! Soon. (I have the rest of the ingredients, obv.).
8812 2018-01-02 03:30:51 Yes, fresh bulk chickpeas cook up a bajillion times faster than the ones from Obama's presidency. 

Yes, I ate hummus while out walking earlier and that's how I had the idea to make hummus for dinner.

Yes, extra olive oil is key in both meals.
8813 2018-01-02 03:30:48 Coconut Oil is my bestfriend .

8826 2018-01-02 03:29:32 Hey uh...oil doesn’t moisturize. It seals in moisture. You still need a water-based lotion underneath. 
8827 2018-01-02 03:29:29 Facts! Did you know Vita Coco has a coconut oil? Literally my fave!
8828 2018-01-02 03:29:29 Try lavender oil

8831 2018-01-02 03:29:13 The US and the West have wreaked havoc in the ME. Oil and arms.
Israel (and the Palestinians) are both victims because the Brits & the international community caused the mess in Palestine but it suits them to continue to divide and rule!

8837 2018-01-02 03:27:53 My goddess nu growth oil has proven to be my most popular product. Ppl love it cuz it works & it works fast. I made it for my own hair originally so of course it’s bomb af. I’m the queen of edges lol.
8838 2018-01-02 03:27:38 Yep minimum risk but shows that stats don’t always transfer. Did end up costing a roster spot that could’ve been used for a useful player though
8839 2018-01-02 03:27:32 * Oil and me mix oddly
8840 2018-01-02 03:27:27 Look recently, Scotland can't survive alone as the oil's gone then a new field come on line and the headlines are of the govt welcoming the first British oil from it coming ashore.
8841 2018-01-02 03:27:23 When i started to give coconut oil to my dogs 10 years ago everyone was saying its not good  and thank to my dogs and you and DT mercola all the familly takes it, and we all are also keto  xxxx
8842 2018-01-02 03:27:21 Kya chate ho Andaman Nicobar ka natural vegetation khatam ho jaye aur vo bhi Delhi jitna polluted ho jaye
Aur waise bhi instead of wasting money on exploring new sources we should improve technology to reduce dependency on oil nd natural gas that that will be good for everyone
8843 2018-01-02 03:27:20 2018 New Year's Resolutions (if i commit to it on twitter maybe i'll be faithful):

Try new challenging oil painting styles. 
Actually reply to people FB messages. 

So far Im failing at the latter.
8844 2018-01-02 03:27:12 Anyone else wondering when the mud, oil or jelly wrestling is coming this season? #RelationShep
8845 2018-01-02 03:26:59 Heat 2 tbsp of coconut/sesame oil, add 1/2 an onion, diced, and cook until translucent, add cubed tofu (if you flour it, that might be better so it gets crispy), add ginger, garlic, and shallots if you choose. Add chili, s/p. Add coconut milk. Add red curry paste. Add veg stems.
8846 2018-01-02 03:26:02 well, like oil & water, I can't quite adapt or fit
8847 2018-01-02 03:25:44 I forgot about olive oil 
8848 2018-01-02 03:25:28 Lmaooooooooo girl if you mix this w/ bby oil it works 
8849 2018-01-02 03:25:21 i’m going to try witch hazel cause it has anti aging properties too  but I use castor oil on my brows and lashes and lemme tell you they grew out so much but I might try shea butter since castor oil is really thick
8850 2018-01-02 03:25:16 If you’re feeling nervous for something, I highly recommend using a diffuser with a calming essential oil. A calming smell can calm the mind.

8852 2018-01-02 03:25:14 Learned how to change the oil in my car today. I also put the bolt on backwards so apparently I’m not that good. Lol #learningnewthings #2018
8853 2018-01-02 03:25:02 We have our own oil in America! We dont need Iran's oil you dolt! Maybe, just maybe, Trump is happy for the Iranian people fighting for actual freedom
8854 2018-01-02 03:24:49 He blocked me long ago.  Thin skin and YUGE BIGLY ego.  BIGLY beer belly too. Never trusted the guy from the get-go.  Creepy vibes. Snake oil salesman.
8855 2018-01-02 03:24:49 50% sugar and oil, 13% Nuts and Chocolate and 37% mystery
8856 2018-01-02 03:24:34 But don't forget, Trump thinks it's ok to take property of our enemies; he still can't believe we didn't take the oil! So as far as he is concerned, those frozen assets were ours...
8857 2018-01-02 03:24:30 We know you’re after their oil for your rich cronies.
8858 2018-01-02 03:24:24 Iran is greater than its regime. No one will disagree with that besides the regime & it’s lackeys. Iran is an 80-million-strong nation with rich history, culture, & spirit. Iran has ski slopes, beaches, oil, industry, & endless potential. Iranians deserve better. They know this.
8859 2018-01-02 03:24:18 Refined Oil  பயன்பாட்டை தவிர்க்கலாம்.  செக்கிலிட்ட நல்ல எண்ணெய் மற்றும் கடலை எண்ணெய்யை பயன்படுத்தலாம். ஆரோக்கியமான உணவை வளரும் தலைமுறைக்கு பரிசளிப்போம்.

8869 2018-01-02 03:23:14 Unfortunately it has been a thing for several years now, also note how many petrol stations now sell 25ltrs of home heating oil and generally not seen but how many homes raise the back of the oil tank to get the last of the oil when they have no money to buy more.
8870 2018-01-02 03:23:14 Try the oil place in the mall they have nice stuff .
8871 2018-01-02 03:22:56 Kava tea and diffused lavender oil...
8872 2018-01-02 03:22:49 Pakistan getting into dialogue with @POTUS will not end well for the begging country. Anyway, Pakistan probably gets more money from China now! China controls Pakistan and thats why Trump is upset. Dangerous times @zakstradsrscafe @russelljones25 More reason for oil to rise!
8873 2018-01-02 03:22:46 Ung pwede naman ako gumamit ng baby oil para tanggalin ung dikit. Kaso maspinili ko ung gaas. Haha.
8874 2018-01-02 03:22:41 I am afraid that ( Trump ) has led the big Tiger into Latin America opportunities just like recently the gigantic Russian oil corporation has signed an agreement with Cuba / Venezuela to take some of the barrels of Oil that Venezuela supplied to  Cuba
8875 2018-01-02 03:22:27 There was nothing wrong with that signing...was worth taking a shot.

8880 2018-01-02 03:21:17 we were depending on middle eastern countries for oil is the same way we are going to depend on countries who control the bulk of lithium reserves. and extracting it is not a clean process as well. am not spreading hatred. relax. I can tell ur nose is getting bigger. (2/2)
8881 2018-01-02 03:21:10 i forgot to pit tea tree oil on my pimples and im too lazy to go upstairs and do it and its cold in my house someone please see this and tell me to do it please i need a sign to clear my acne
8882 2018-01-02 03:21:09 All we send your way is Alberta Clippers.  

We keep trying to send Oil but Quebec says "NO" ... and keeps importing from the Saudi's, supporting a horrible regime.  While dumping raw sewage in the St.Lawrence.  But that's none of my business.
8883 2018-01-02 03:21:03 Use avocado oil as a moisturizer and to naturally grow your eyelashes, thank me later. (Safe for oily skin, ya girl is oily and it still works)

Actually i generate horrendous amounts of ring around the collar and sleeves and I'm not even Italian! think it comes from consuming too much olive oil!
8888 2018-01-02 03:20:19 Why my mans use my other mans forehead oil as chapstick?

8893 2018-01-02 03:19:45 I guess there was a polite request to blow over the Pentagon Papers in that one for The Post? It's mentioned, but mostly just for NYT breaking it.
8894 2018-01-02 03:19:44 Husband, as I inherit his old Macbook: "Keep this one clean, OK?"
Me: "Of course."
A week passes
Me: [thinking] I got olive oil on the screen, is that bad
8895 2018-01-02 03:19:38 I never said burning oil is the future. People used to say if you have an alternative to oil, we will not have to rely on middle eastern countries for their oil. and many taught EV is the future.  But making batteries require non-renewable resource lithium. The same way (1/2)

8917 2018-01-02 03:15:52 Moon in cancer self care for this evening-lavender bath, coconut oil hair wash, walk in the moonlight to charge your crystals, a phone call w a near and dear, and a note in my journal.

8919 2018-01-02 03:15:46 I don’t know why i mixed my coconut/avocado body oil with eucalyptus and rubbed it all over my legs. Now I feel like I took a bath in vapor rub

8927 2018-01-02 03:13:58 Castor Oil really works? Sigh. It just sounds so gross
8928 2018-01-02 03:13:56 I just shaved my butt, so you can oil me up and use me for a slip 'n slide.
8929 2018-01-02 03:13:53 Lavender in oil diffuser, candles lit, incense burning.. a cup of tea while reading about my chakras. 
8930 2018-01-02 03:13:36 i absolutely hate the smell of tea tree oil but if it makes me beautiful i guess i'll smear it all over my face
8931 2018-01-02 03:13:32 Agreed.  He is being pushed into confrontation by Evangelical supporters & also Israeli lobbyists;  obviously, oil barons like Tillerson, T-Boone Pickens, Harold Hamm,  are unlikely to object to this.  It's a gift for oil bulls, evangelicals, & Israel  (& Saudi) supporters #jcpoa

8938 2018-01-02 03:12:35 Must’ve run out of oil!
8939 2018-01-02 03:12:33 I’ve been using an oil on my dry patches & it turns out the oil I’ve been using is extremely drying :-)
8940 2018-01-02 03:12:05 Cannabis oil is usually made from single-bladed "sugar leaves," which are high in THC and grow in the buds of a marijuana plant.

8947 2018-01-02 03:11:03 Ivanka-translator: "Jared sez Mr Rex sez we can have oil maybe, if we can provoke Unrest in Middle-East"...
8948 2018-01-02 03:11:02 The US didn't let India buy oil from Iran remember? Not too difficult for US to arm twist countries.
8949 2018-01-02 03:10:50 Brexit & our rigged elections r connected thru Bannon's Cambridge Analytical & Mercer's data  Company. Mercer is the biggest donor to Trump next to the NRA.

8961 2018-01-02 03:09:45 Hey, they believe there’s oil down the clyde which they can’t access because of Trident and use  emoji, as the unicorn is chained, anything’s believable. I’m disappointed they don’t really think I’m an agent!!
8962 2018-01-02 03:09:41 That is the stupidest argument and you people ALWAYS defer to it.  As if it's somehow YOUR country.  "Hey mom, the bathroom door is squeaky."  "Get the hell out!!"  Or we could maybe oil...the... hinge?

8967 2018-01-02 03:09:03 I think he most likely wants oil prices higher, but he can't come out and say he wants high gas prices. Likely he wants to help Saudi get oil prices up, as they need it to help with their IPO of Aramco. I also think Iran sanctions are higher in priority that oil/gas specifically.

-Stomach coaters such as Emetrol 
-Eat protein to help your serotonin work better=less anxiety and your body will heal better.

8989 2018-01-02 03:05:35 Idk why y’all are surprised that you’re ashy when you dry your skin completely before moisturizing. Like water is the most hydrating thing you can use. Oil & lotion just lock the moisture in. You need at least damp skin!!!

8995 2018-01-02 03:05:10 Can you elaborate?  The fact he made this statement this after leaving Saudi Arabia, plus announcing at the same time starting a sale of the SPR, leaves me suspect of his true priorities and intentions.  Actions supporting higher oil prices, which the US could be a King of sales
8996 2018-01-02 03:05:03 I think I ended up not sharing: my resolution this year is to do at least one small oil painting study per week!

8999 2018-01-02 03:04:24 Oh, no, I chuck the bacon right in there raw and let it cook up, along with the kale, some oil, and garlic, (after the garlic has been sauteed, I throw my wine in there and perform a reduction, then throw my kale and bacon in there) with a hefty helping of stock.
9000 2018-01-02 03:04:08 You bet ya, so we can continue to pay lots and lots of cash  to the oil producers. Just like our profiteering President is costing us. How many times has he visited Trump properties since he became President. It’s just our tax dollars but whose counting. Middle-class suckers!

9041 2018-01-02 02:57:58 That foundation is raved about but I think it's grosssss. I'd just suggest moisturizing more and maybe trying the hangover primer or another really moisturizing primer/face oil like a rose hip oil or tsubaki oil.
9042 2018-01-02 02:57:54 I need my coconut oil
9043 2018-01-02 02:57:54 Coconut oil really is the best make up remover. Just saying.
9044 2018-01-02 02:57:21 the sexual politics of naive people assuming Extra Virgin olive oil is in some way “better” than regular olive oil, even though it’s objectively worse for cooking.

9062 2018-01-02 02:53:51 Geo-political uncertainty and Iran situation gives a boost to the price of oil @ZaksTradersCafe @russelljones25 @truemagic68
9063 2018-01-02 02:53:34 Actually no, all we've accomplished with the deal is paying them to be more covert in their goal of nuclear weaponry while oil profiting.
9064 2018-01-02 02:53:30 I can’t put oil on my face because I break out
9065 2018-01-02 02:53:17 Stronger israel as middle east power, oil assets for USA, weapons sales, etc

9067 2018-01-02 02:53:13 coconut oil is the only thing that worked on my legs last year. They were so dry that the itch was waking me up in the middle of the night.
9068 2018-01-02 02:53:11 You're always so sensitive. I have nothing against the oil industry. Enjoy the it has become more Canadian in the last few years.
9069 2018-01-02 02:53:01 I’m tired of my parents doing ignorant shit to the leftovers... like why are you gonna put cheese in the spaghetti then put it in the fridge?? You lose the cheese in the reheat and the oil separates... like they haven’t been Italian their whole fuckin lives I’m ashamed
9070 2018-01-02 02:52:54 That's what we need, more oil!
9071 2018-01-02 02:52:50 how can oil leak stop leaking..... #StreetOutlaws

9080 2018-01-02 02:50:50 Finally getting to use my oil diffuser for the first time and I put too much lavender oil in it and now I have a headache.
9081 2018-01-02 02:50:35 Frank I love your resolutions! But I was confused by # 8. Is it anti oil? Please clarify. Thanks and HNY!
9082 2018-01-02 02:49:52 Except it is 97% agree, so the 50/50 point is pointless. Most who don’t agree are generally not earth scientists, have not been peer reviewed, or have deep and long connections to the oil&gas industries.

9093 2018-01-02 02:48:26 You’re very welcome! TBH, when I first went on this diet it was preprepared meat and a big salad w olive oil/balsamic and some nuts. I just had to put it together and eat. That was November 2016 and by the spring I was able to cook a bit again.

9096 2018-01-02 02:47:59 Iran, Iraq and Afghan, all the countries had similar cultural outlook during that period of time. Once oil money hit the region, the devious mullahs strengthened themselves with thugs in power. People, like always, were pawns!

9099 2018-01-02 02:47:42 Oil just keeps going up, can anyone please explain why?
9100 2018-01-02 02:47:41 I made brownies but accidentally used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and they taste Not Good
9101 2018-01-02 02:47:29 One time me and @Houstonwinslow4 were driving to San Juan islands and we popped his  hood to his car to see that the oil cap was not on and oil was spilling everywhere on his engine. To fix this problem we jammed a rockstar can to cover the hole and stop the oil from leaking.
9102 2018-01-02 02:47:26 It’s an unproven myth. And even if it’s true thank your stars ( and stripes) that he is your president, not some road dude oil wheeler dealer like the Bush family.

9113 2018-01-02 02:45:44 And I'm not talking about every other industry under the sun.  I'm talking specifically about the oil and gas industry here in BC as compared to the USA.  And I feel the oil and gas industry is always improving.

9120 2018-01-02 02:44:41 loooove when ajee makes coconut oil 
9121 2018-01-02 02:44:15 Need to save a reason for why it closes at highest since 2014.  "Oil closes at highest since 2014" based on Iranian tensions, tightening inventories, pipeline eating termites, etc." Have to be creative. The same becomes monotonous.
9122 2018-01-02 02:44:14 I know it’s cold when my coconut oil is solid AF.
9123 2018-01-02 02:44:11 I'm talking about you calling green energy industry hipocritical, when they leak what a barrel of oil, compared to thousands of barrels per leak. Say the risk of fire is high but risk from oil and gas higher. Risk to environment high but still haven't cleaned up oil from Exxon.
9124 2018-01-02 02:44:02 Kaya for #2018 everyone should tighten& budget their money very carefully as more oil & gas prices are being raised, the sin tax on #tobacco #cigarettes #alcohol will be heftier this year and so will all food prices would all go up but there wont be any significant salary raise
9125 2018-01-02 02:43:58 Not silly at all! I don't have a microwave, though. I do have an electric blanket andbthe oven preheating to make cookies for the people coming with oil in the morning, lol
9126 2018-01-02 02:43:56 The US interfere's enough in foreign affairs placing themselves as the cops of the world, these people don't need that kind of interference, US does nothing for others with there being an ulterior motive, ya know, like oil.

9133 2018-01-02 02:42:51 Everyone supported the 1979 Revolution in Iran except Big Oil. There were socialists, feminists, Islamists and everything in between. Also, that article is stupid for blaming Clinton for taking the MEK off the list of terror groups, when the EU and Britain did years earlier.

9139 2018-01-02 02:41:41 Don't be so naive as to believe what you read & hear in the News. Modern News Reports fail to provide Perspective & Context. The reason: The excuses for war in the Middle East are all to do with access to Oil. That is why the US, UK & Israel Collaborate to destabilize ME Nations.

9142 2018-01-02 02:41:08 The story is one-sided anti-pipeline? It's fact based on industry reporting all the leaks listed are fact. Can't give another side to fact. Fact is it would take 100 years of oil leak from one wind turbine to equal one small pipeline leak.
9143 2018-01-02 02:40:54 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that

9148 2018-01-02 02:40:40 Let’s unseal those records that cost about 5 million in court fees to keep sealed. Give this snake oil salesman something to talk about.
9149 2018-01-02 02:40:28 It's okay because that is one stereotype that sort of fits for me. Lol. I don't know a ton about cars. The only thing I really know is how to change tire, jump a car, and check/add oil. So the basics.

9154 2018-01-02 02:40:15 4-6% is a good estimate for average depletion. That means the world needs to replace 4-5 mmb/d per year & that hasn't happened for a long time. Most oil bears over-estimate how much shale can add &/or take mega-project forecasts at nameplate rates and timing--bad mistake.

9211 2018-01-02 02:31:37 Many reasons why shale cannot keep the market oversupplied.  0% interest rates are gone.  Shale oil is top heavy and cannot be processed straight- it must be blended.  My guess - differentials weigh in and the shale business takes double hit moderating an expected speedy recovery

9222 2018-01-02 02:29:55 I dunno if it's better than argan oil. But it works for me and many others. It's cheap and is always original. Problem with these exotic stuff is we never really know how pure or original it is.

9241 2018-01-02 02:27:06 Seriously this is my first time hearing it. Is it pure? The one you use? Is it good?

I've always thought argan oil is like the superoil for skin and hair sebab my friend dulu pernah import directly from Morocco & she raved about its effectiveness. It's quite cheap too.

9254 2018-01-02 02:26:02 It's the condition of the LBMA that really matters. In order for the CNY oil futures to do what some project, namely, cause a run on physical, it'll have to capture a sizable portion of the global oil trade. It should be interesting to say the least.
9255 2018-01-02 02:25:39 I said screw it, I'll make fried chicken tonight. and use my peanut oil.
9256 2018-01-02 02:25:30 I think the stress comes from his oil numbers, his hate tweets, Hollywood not liking him. Ultimately Drumpf wants to be loved and respected and he knows he will not get that ever and it will bug him until he takes his last breath.

9262 2018-01-02 02:24:23 As I think you know, Alma, I like asparagus served with oil and salt. And knowing this, you have prepared this asparagus with butter.

9269 2018-01-02 02:22:45 No. The NY Times never had journalistic integrity. During the Holocaust, they put the News in the back pages, like pp. 45-45. They were always a fake. They just “looked good,” y’know, like Obama. Two peas in a pod. Lots of snake oil.

9299 2018-01-02 02:19:01 The main downside is that if you are not careful it can get everywhere and stain certain surfaces. It takes a little more work applying oil compared to lotion. But I do believe it works better in the long run. Especially in winter months.
9300 2018-01-02 02:18:59 Is that the organic natural oil?

9356 2018-01-02 02:09:51 ぽはやぅ
9357 2018-01-02 02:09:36 Apparently the oil they need for the rides was frozen. They closed three hours early, too.
9358 2018-01-02 02:09:30 ぽはゆ
9359 2018-01-02 02:09:29 Mahnaz Food. But they do sell that argan oil, argan extract stuff. For external use.
9360 2018-01-02 02:09:27 Have you ever tried rosehip oil? I just started using it and it’s done great things for my skin. 
9361 2018-01-02 02:09:07 started out 2018 by driving down the LIE next to a Tesla with a license plate that said: “OIL LOL”
9362 2018-01-02 02:08:53 Well at this rate I'm about to know all of the employees! I was just in there in November for a new battery and oil change. Because I unknowingly have an oil leak that isn't very noticeable. But, at one point I was basically driving with no oil..
9363 2018-01-02 02:08:33 very simple, the Oil price in the world market has dramatically increased from 58 to 67$Per barrels.KSA has also increased 80% of the oil price with in the country.Depends on world Oil market.
9364 2018-01-02 02:08:29 I cooked spinach with a bit of mozarella cheese and lots of cayenne pepper and put on some olive oil and garlic and then brocolli and it came out really good folks
9365 2018-01-02 02:08:22 ぽきた
9366 2018-01-02 02:08:18 Someone gotta check your oil
9367 2018-01-02 02:08:15 I found my eucalyptus oil. It's going down.
9368 2018-01-02 02:07:58 Ahhh JizzHoe is so better than HoeSucc. But anywho..bitch I'd oil his boing boing.
9369 2018-01-02 02:07:58 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
9370 2018-01-02 02:07:52 You do need a facial hydration wash, followed by a blend of black castor oil and E.
9371 2018-01-02 02:07:51 like an oil change on a automobile??
9372 2018-01-02 02:07:12 A2: I had to disable two of my island caches for two years due to the infamous Kalamazoo River oil spill. Eventually those morons at Enbridge got it cleaned up enough to reactivate them. #USGeocachingHour
9373 2018-01-02 02:07:02 TIME FOR THE PATCHOULI OIL. 
9374 2018-01-02 02:06:48 Infairness to coconut oil , it’s good for the hair & scalp, a steel brush, be sure Agnes had tetanus shot 
9375 2018-01-02 02:06:38 i had started using coconut oil but i stopped smh im gonna have to start again!! thanks girl!
9376 2018-01-02 02:06:32 Full service is not what happens. I would pay extra to pump, check oil and clean windows !
9377 2018-01-02 02:06:25 Let me just give a definition, just so we can clear up this misunderstanding:
hummus
ˈhʊməs,ˈhʌməs/Submit
noun
a thick paste or spread made from ground chickpeas and sesame seeds, olive oil, lemon, and garlic, made originally in the Middle East.
9378 2018-01-02 02:06:06 coordination can be voluntary, the local anarchists just need channels of communication and they'd be able to organize themselves to create and protect covenant communities.
9379 2018-01-02 02:05:55 I thought they only did that at Lucas Oil Stadium
9380 2018-01-02 02:05:54 kalo bekas jerawat bakalan hilang sendiri sebenernya tapi lama, biar lebih cepat caranya pake exfoliation agent untuk regenerasi kulit. coba cari produk mengandung AHA yang mild & gentle, atau mau coba dari face oil bisa pake tamanu/rosehip seed oil. semangat!
9381 2018-01-02 02:05:25 Don’t forget War! Trillions in cost to secure oil and the terror activities that followed...medical, etc.
9382 2018-01-02 02:05:12 Wipe your eye makeup off with coconut oil, I havent done it in a while but when I was my eyelashes were poppin
9383 2018-01-02 02:05:11 False.  Venezuela is sitting on an ocean of oil, yet they are jailing bakers and eating zoo animals, because marxist central planning always fails.

9384 2018-01-02 02:05:10 The US invaded the middle east for oil
9385 2018-01-02 02:05:00 That pic was after I had made a jerk marinade, brined/marinated the chicken wings for a few hours, then parbaked them. I dusted them with flour + cornstarch + seasoning & fried in canola oil. Very effing tasty.
9386 2018-01-02 02:04:55 4/13 introduced by Gulf oil producers over the past two years to boost revenues and cut #SAUDI #UAE #AUSTERITY
9387 2018-01-02 02:04:52 All the essential oil bullshit 1 in 5 military spouses seem to sell as a side gig.
9388 2018-01-02 02:04:51 誰か新庄に乗せてってください
9389 2018-01-02 02:04:16 @Skelotim Pure tea tree oil saved my nose ring. Smells like shit but it dries out any infection quick. Hope this helps 
9390 2018-01-02 02:04:05 Get an essential oil diffuser with lavender oil. It’s seriously life changing.
9391 2018-01-02 02:03:57 $COMB takes the “#Vanguard approach”:  It utilizes an index replication approach, is the cheapest commodity vehicle out there (30bps), and there is no K-1.  I prefer the #Bloomberg #Commodity index over the #GSCI because energy/oil capped at 30% in BBG vs. 60% in GSCI.  #ETFIQ
9392 2018-01-02 02:03:50 最高です！
おめでとうございます
9393 2018-01-02 02:03:46 I need a oil change. It can not wait.
9394 2018-01-02 02:03:32 No oil on my cuticles yet, but yay snowflakes and a penguin! #NailDay #NailArt #lovepenguins
9395 2018-01-02 02:03:07 Text from Seth - “decided to buy an essential oil diffuser because I have this hip cool apartment now”
9396 2018-01-02 02:02:54 wood dust gets on all the metal tools and sucks up the oil so they rust, and metal chips end up embedded in your nice walnut slabs
9397 2018-01-02 02:02:37 throwback to when mike was like

"raj got one of those essential oil diffuser things and I thought it was like that Alexa thing and started talking to it and it went like 'PCHH' and I thought I broke it"
9398 2018-01-02 02:02:17 I like Frankenscence and Rosemary oil:)
9399 2018-01-02 02:02:03 and if we do ever run out of coal, we'll always have whale oil

9402 2018-01-02 02:01:46 I hope this oil works magic for my hair
9403 2018-01-02 02:01:40 Oh honey no I don’t believe in any essential oil heals the soul bullshit. I just like how lavender smells
9404 2018-01-02 02:01:39 Pretty unlikely waste heat is being used on anything with as low a CF as oil gensets. 

Even said, very likely ICE is more efficient than steam turbine.
9405 2018-01-02 02:01:36 My parents n brother would eat this absolute crap soaked in oil n shit & I'd get yelled at for not eating it. But what good is it
9406 2018-01-02 02:01:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or welfare use will decrease.
9407 2018-01-02 02:01:03 The best gelato I ever had was Olive Oil flavor.

But, yes, this sounds nasty.
9408 2018-01-02 02:01:02 OK you had me until that essential oil quackery I like my routines to be as unnatural and heavily industrial as possible it’s science  
9409 2018-01-02 02:01:01 ah lavender oil in my diffuser after work is so comfy
9410 2018-01-02 02:00:50 I LOOK LIKE I JUST DROWNED IN OIL BUT THANKS ILY
9411 2018-01-02 02:00:40 If I have oil/treatment in my hair I’m not leaving the crib for nothing or no one
9412 2018-01-02 02:00:20 OIL DIFF: 6.85 -> 6.93
9413 2018-01-02 02:00:11 Bad attitude is just like bad engine oil the longer you keep it running through your system, more damage it does to your drive.
9414 2018-01-02 02:00:08 Amen. Happy new year Pastor Paula, more oil for the light.

9416 2018-01-02 01:59:22 I think Obama is a thinking man, that actually thinks about what he's saying.  Trump on the other hand just spews whatever crosses his pea brain and whatever the consequences.  He's a snake oil salesman. 
Where as Obama is a genuine caring  thoughtful man.  That is not aloof.
9417 2018-01-02 01:59:07 Oil auto correct ... must be not mushy sorry
9418 2018-01-02 01:59:05 Baker walked on to Texas Tech then decided to transfer and walked onto Oklahoma. He is nothing like Big Oil Johnny Football
9419 2018-01-02 01:59:01 Bailey got me an aromatherapy oil diffuser for xmas and I'm so happy right now it's literally the best thing I've ever gotten I'm in love with this thing and I'm never leaving my room
9420 2018-01-02 01:58:57 Libs still live in hope but the voters aren’t buying the snake oil. Mal has lost 25 straight Newspolls, so that means Bill has won 25 straight
9421 2018-01-02 01:58:31 You poor mugs your democracy has been stolen by the banks, insurance companies oil interest and Trump enables that... You guys are worried about Russia, Iran..... FFS look at your political system that is rigged against
1. smaller parties
2. the poor
9422 2018-01-02 01:58:31 Typical useful American Idiot, Let's back a coup, attack their oil industry, place sanctions on them and then blame Socialism for Capitalism
9423 2018-01-02 01:58:13 Because they have the oil
9424 2018-01-02 01:57:18 You ever try essential oils? Peppermint oil works really good for pain or inflammation. Hope ya feel better 
9425 2018-01-02 01:57:15 So... do you see $OIL If it breaks this $60-62 area... could see some fireworks.
9426 2018-01-02 01:56:54 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
9427 2018-01-02 01:56:53 @POTUS stop buying oil from Venezuela and you will do a checkmate to many bastards of Latinoamerica. Happy New Year! @marcorubio @ibepacheco @RosLehtinen
9428 2018-01-02 01:56:51 200 miles past a oil change I ain’t triffin.
9429 2018-01-02 01:56:45 Might wanna add some cork grease and valve oil Because you definitely didn’t touch em over winter break
9430 2018-01-02 01:56:33 Smooth talker though. Played the part flawlessly for the cameras. Still does. The Greatest snake oil salesman of ALL TIME.
9431 2018-01-02 01:56:18 I can't believe Jeopardy has been on all this time and never mentioned Bob Ross. 

My favorite art store has him on loop near the oil paint aisle - which is right next to the watercolor and fancy paper aisles… so every time I shop, I get my fix of happy clouds and trees. 
9432 2018-01-02 01:55:46 I shouldn't laugh because you really never know and I believe in jinxing.  My lesson of 2017 to myself was never disregard the other side, no matter how confident you are in your own convictions that something will play into your favour.  Things appear good, but never certain.
9433 2018-01-02 01:55:44 My entire body is so dry..I just wanna bathe in a tub of coconut oil #WheresSummer
9434 2018-01-02 01:55:39 My essential oil diffuser is the best thing I’ve ever owned

9436 2018-01-02 01:55:14 Pruitt strikes again! He fucked OK over so badly, sold out to the oil companies and let them frack the shit out of everything. OK now has me seismic activity than CA. So yeah, let's give him a national position, let him bring in his cronies. Business as usual.
9437 2018-01-02 01:55:11 Yes an oil tycoon as Secretary of State, openly and unabashedly offending political leaders and people all over the world via twitter, and calling human rights “obstacles”- definitely a great foreign policy there. #maga ?
9438 2018-01-02 01:55:00 Cant wait for my lava stone braclets and lavender oil to come friday so i can calm down and sleep
9439 2018-01-02 01:54:55 Started off the new year by burning the fuck out my arm with hot oil, wow I hope this isn’t a sign of things to come.

I am a perfectly functional well oiled baby-making machine.

Johnsons baby oil
It's worth it 
9441 2018-01-02 01:54:36 My oil is low and needs to be changed why else would I need to get an oil change  Wtf
9442 2018-01-02 01:54:12 "The company went through years of tumult, including being on the brink of bankruptcy at least three times....During the 1980s, the company bought at least 5 polystyrene plants from companies like Shell Oil Co., according to the Huntsman Corp website."  21/
9443 2018-01-02 01:54:12 too bad that if the govt of iran collapsed it would be swiftly substituted by terrorists before anarchists could secure themselves.
9444 2018-01-02 01:54:11 Like if I need to go get an oil change don't ask me why I need to get an oil change 
9445 2018-01-02 01:54:11 Iran is wonderful for trump. He doesnt have to deal with his 2 owners China and Russia selling oil to North Korea

9455 2018-01-02 01:52:53 Forget foreign oil. We have our own oil and electric cars. Buy Tesla and American oil. No reason to send money abroad but to Chicago where half of the population live below poverty levels. Let the Pakistani aid come to an end today and spend it in Chicago. Just a thought.
9456 2018-01-02 01:52:47 Yup Baker just don’t got them oil checks.
9457 2018-01-02 01:52:43 The Oiler, as a superhero who tries to protect the wilderness by SHOOTING OIL, makes no sense, but in this idea it makes PERFECT SENSE, he was a human weapon created to destroy the habitats of animals to stop their spread!

9510 2018-01-02 01:41:32 The left is always calling things Extremely Normal as if being normal is a good thing when normal coincides with tons of neoliberal shit like supporting child murder to steal oil.
9511 2018-01-02 01:41:31 Now watch CA get this total boom economy like Alaska as with oil.
9512 2018-01-02 01:41:28 Clean space. Dust removed. Anointing oil in my candle. My kind of fresh start 
9513 2018-01-02 01:41:27 Slavery was banned under Gaddafi it was probably ONE of the best things he ever did. That and nationalizing their oil. But there was no slavery under Gaddafi. Tony Blair kissed that guy on the lips for some of those policies too.
9514 2018-01-02 01:40:50 Alaskans own 15,482 shares of GULFPORT ENERGY CORP, worth $266,136. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.

9517 2018-01-02 01:40:38 Beard oil came in the mail today...y’all stay tuned 
9518 2018-01-02 01:40:35 Oh yea n there was avocado how could I forget lol. And at the end I added olive oil and a touch of oregano.
9519 2018-01-02 01:40:20 Make the oil companies and military industrial complex more money..... at the low low cost of American soldier's Lives. 

That is the strategy.
9520 2018-01-02 01:40:10 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
9521 2018-01-02 01:39:56 Yeah the gas companies thought it would be good to gouge the consumer and blame the government, wondering why the grocers get caught on price collusion but they touch big oil
9522 2018-01-02 01:39:47 Drenched in olive oil! How can you resist, good sir??
9523 2018-01-02 01:39:40 something about putting oil on ur scalp.

9525 2018-01-02 01:39:20 After a brief talk with the boss, The Oil & Gas business will be quite indelicate in a few years time. A sunset business, to be precise.

Sooner or later, Shell is predicted to be a shop retailing company and by looking at the current market in Malaysia, they’re going rock bottom
9526 2018-01-02 01:38:58 When Trump became President, Government was the smallest it’s been since 1966 ... there’s a lot of balderdash floating around. Texas oil makes it rich. Alabama, La! Ark, a lot of other states have smaller government and cadge off the bigger more prosperous states.
9527 2018-01-02 01:38:44 Amazing stuff
9528 2018-01-02 01:38:28 With great pride they video these acts knowing that these country civilians have no chance, given their govt has sold them out and turns its back on them....   sad

9530 2018-01-02 01:37:58 in my mind I'm imagining bits of bone floating around in him and the bubbly oil making dinosaur shapes maybe like a "prehistoric zac"
9531 2018-01-02 01:37:45 drinking water all 2018.
black soap all 2018.

coconut oil all 2018.
9532 2018-01-02 01:37:27 don’t you love starting off the new year without heat or any hot water and being told that you have to wait till the end of the week for more oil to come??? #HappyNewYear2018
9533 2018-01-02 01:37:23 If you’re not trying to go darker pls don’t use coconut oil often. It does make your skin soft but it gradually darken your skin as well. I’ve been so confused as to why I kept getting darker.
9534 2018-01-02 01:37:20 How to smell amazing. Mix Johnson & Johnson's Baby Lotion (not oil) with your favorite perfume.
9535 2018-01-02 01:36:54 Never been, but I already know that.  comment meant that we're an oil importer, not a producer like Alberta, but because of our policies we have a cheap price at the pump. Gas should be the same price as we pay in Alberta.  Also I don't watch CNN, EVER
9536 2018-01-02 01:36:27 But... It's because they're using baby oil, lotion, and Vaseline. Like spreading lies making bottoms try to do the impossible.
9537 2018-01-02 01:36:25 Simple: More education is needed. Of Libtards. 'Splain to them that there's 1,500 active volcanoes, and 10,000 oceanic fissures spewing oil 24/7, and there's not a damn thing anybody can do about it.
9538 2018-01-02 01:36:22 This cold weather make my skin dry af , gotta keep the lotion and baby oil around at all times.
9539 2018-01-02 01:36:13 Coconut oil? Lol
9540 2018-01-02 01:36:08 Anteriormente era igual pero con el símbolo de la Shell Oil Company.
9541 2018-01-02 01:36:05 What peaceful protestors? What are you drinking? Theyre shooting at police with guns, blowing oil pipelines up and attacking police barracks. And you call them peaceful?
9542 2018-01-02 01:36:03 I wish I could bathe in coconut oil
9543 2018-01-02 01:35:20 Coconut oil with lavender >>> 

I feel like a silky little dolphin.
9544 2018-01-02 01:35:01 No stream today, I've been running around all day and changed the oil and oil filter in my truck. I'm exhausted 
9545 2018-01-02 01:34:33 You were fooled on taxes. You sold your vote for tricks. You should apologize to the voters of Maine.  Soon you will be out and don’t think it’s to become Governor. Maine needs thoughtful representation not people who buy snake oil. Retire already.
9546 2018-01-02 01:34:26 "New year, new me!"
I say as I dive into the pile of crabs, completely covered in baby oil.
9547 2018-01-02 01:34:20 There is no doubt Israel/US started this revolt in Iran for signing oil infrastructure in yuan, imo. Israel/US has made there move, now lets see how Iran and its allies respond. Middle East is getting heated again.
9548 2018-01-02 01:33:56 We all know he can play at Lucas Oil already
9549 2018-01-02 01:33:40 I am taller than KAI... I guess that peaches helps you grow better than curry and chili oil...
9550 2018-01-02 01:33:33 Better than you, I don't fall for charlatans and snake oil salesmen
9551 2018-01-02 01:33:20 Sorry for the language, but he is all #BlusterandBullshit . No other way to say it. Our country is all alone, and in serious trouble if NK decides to unleash a nuclear weapons. Russia & China are sneaking them oil, while our allies have been alienated at a new level in mod. hx!
9552 2018-01-02 01:33:05 Don't forget y2k and the cold war. Seems like the big money is in oil, IT and arms, if you look at the 1% now. As a money making scam I'm not sure how well it's doing.

9554 2018-01-02 01:32:49 Looks like a pleasant day. I’ve grounded myself until I do an oil change later this week.
9555 2018-01-02 01:32:45 2018 is the year of the essential oil diffuser
9556 2018-01-02 01:32:44 Remember at the beginning of Advent Children, when Barret--The guy you spend thirty hours with as he goes on and on about protecting the Planet-- strikes it rich as an oil baron?

What the hell.
9557 2018-01-02 01:32:42 キャスのときはならないんだけどな
9558 2018-01-02 01:32:39 Have you ever used tea tree oil? That's the only oil I have right now and I'm really excited to try it lol. I'm going to have to get almond because that sounds amazing!
9559 2018-01-02 01:32:39 My aunt trying to explain her CBD oil: “It’s PCP oil”
9560 2018-01-02 01:32:38 Grease up the driveway, it's time for the women to arrive.

Why does it always look like there's been a rainstorm -- or an oil spill -- on that driveway at the rental brothel?

9562 2018-01-02 01:32:11 USA has lots of oil and resources, and though we need to reward countries that are cooperative with US interests, it’s feasible to cut back in the interest of self preservation and improve the of the economy and infrastructure of the USA.
9563 2018-01-02 01:32:11 Told you about the oil fields.
9564 2018-01-02 01:32:04 Does wild growth hair oil work? Cause I’m definitely about to buy some ... like right now lol
9565 2018-01-02 01:31:44 We don’t have a Democracy in America. We are a constitutional Republic. Democracy is just another word for “the squeaky wheel gets the oil” ... A constitutional Republic represents all wheels.
9566 2018-01-02 01:31:37 Tea tree oil is everything
9567 2018-01-02 01:31:20 currently making cannabis oil.
9568 2018-01-02 01:31:16 My NYE consisted of running out of oil but I’m thankful for the people who are there for me 24/7 and help me when I need it. I love you. 
9569 2018-01-02 01:31:14 is the rapeseed oil a necessity or can I carry on using low fat spray?
9570 2018-01-02 01:31:12 With that logic, we should stop buying oil from the Saudis.
9571 2018-01-02 01:31:00 Why do you think Baku was the main objective of Fall Blau? You think they wanted the oil fields? Think again! Ze Germans wanted dank ladies.
9572 2018-01-02 01:30:57 No more patchy beards and receding edges. Wild Growth Hair oil works, try it.
9573 2018-01-02 01:30:46 Pakistan  doesn't even have any oil for us to steal. So why do we give them aid?? Stupid!
9574 2018-01-02 01:30:30 I am SUCH an idiot! Was so excited and rushing...forgot to add titanium dioxide AND the fragrance oil to my soap. 　 Oh well, guess it'll be a good test run to see what I need to fix on the next batch.
9575 2018-01-02 01:30:27 2018: the year I start selling drugs to fund my essential oil addiction
9576 2018-01-02 01:30:18 Ultimate skin of Zac. May be fossil oil zac?
9577 2018-01-02 01:30:17 OIL DIFF: 6.79 -> 6.85
9578 2018-01-02 01:30:15 Shoulda used olive oil instead of Pam.
9579 2018-01-02 01:29:23 We are over there for oil. Don't be misleading people like how you mislead them with the open internet preservation act.
9580 2018-01-02 01:29:13 What I would like for 2018 is a car that doesn't leak antifreeze and oil, make a weird sound cause the water pump is breaking and a car were I don't have to crawl in and out through the back in the winter cause the front doors get frozen and won't shut once opened.
9581 2018-01-02 01:28:21 Iranian people  are a progressive society where people read poems aloud, never heard Longfellow or Whitman in tv programs  ever, if it became fundamentalist is for the high crimes of the West stealing oil.
9582 2018-01-02 01:28:16 ONLY SO MUCH OIL IN THE GROUND / TOWER OF POWER (10:21)
Program[brilliant days]
9583 2018-01-02 01:27:53 For the US Dollar chart tweeted few minutes ago a break below 91 will cause a spike in commodities (oil, gold, miners, etc) and a selloff in emerging markets (ticker EDC). The drop in US Dollar might get triggered if US earnings next week do not come out stronger than expected.
9584 2018-01-02 01:27:47 It would be gios if they stopped forgetting my bread and oil 
9585 2018-01-02 01:27:46 Genuinely taken to rubbing olive oil on my eyebrows daily as part of a beauty regime so every evening I go to bed smelling like an Italian starter now
9586 2018-01-02 01:27:29 Comparing 2015 to 2018?
9587 2018-01-02 01:27:26 That’s a good way to do it. I’m doing brown rice, boiled broccoli, and grilled chicken marinated in coconut oil, minced garlic, alittle lemon juice, touch of Cajun spice, and now a few drops of that liquid smoke.
9588 2018-01-02 01:27:25 Shave with coconut oil 
9589 2018-01-02 01:27:17 fantastic i got the spicy ramen!  they use Chinese hot oil to make it spicy its like the best thing ever!!!1!!!
9590 2018-01-02 01:27:07 Many decades of British and American oppression is the background of this mess so it is pretty nauseating to read all this solidarity for people we sold down the river for oil
9591 2018-01-02 01:27:06 Yeah, Ginny; didn't you know that war is good for business? Business is booming. No doubt a lot of insiders have the weapon concessions and the oil connections to continue the war profiteering. Mad King Donald thinks this is making 'Merica Great Again. He's a shit head.
9592 2018-01-02 01:27:06 Vegan Pone; 1.5 cups cornmeal, 1 cup ww flour, 1 tbs. milled flax seed, liquid drained from a 15oz. can of beans or blackeye peas, 1 cup almond or soy milk, 2.25 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. salt 4 tbs. veg oil. stir and pour into an oiled 8 inch cast iron skillet bake 450 for 24m.
9593 2018-01-02 01:26:50 Ah, they are so used to the media lying for them they forget Oil is not about a union or the media, it’s about money. Price was to high; they were lazy. They’ve now improved the industry to make what they need - profit. Eventually they’ll easily remove oil for Scotland’s oil fund
9594 2018-01-02 01:25:51 I'm so appreciative of this. Also? I still haven't done by Yearly Overview tarot reading. Gotta make sure I have some Jamaican Black Castor Oil on deck. 
9595 2018-01-02 01:25:32 I was gon bring fendi some oil but fuck dat nigga 
9596 2018-01-02 01:25:30 My essential oil diffuser makes my room a nice little sanctuary

9598 2018-01-02 01:25:02 so the third valve on my trumpet stopped working.
and all i have is rotor oil.
today is a very sad day.
9599 2018-01-02 01:24:59 I've seen salesmen with more moral authority at Joe's Used Car and Snake Oil Shoppe.
9600 2018-01-02 01:24:54 On the other hand, many pump manuals do tell you not to pump oxygen through hydrocarbon oil.
9601 2018-01-02 01:24:48 Even if it doesn't work at least you can cross it off your list. Olbas oil next..
9602 2018-01-02 01:24:28 This oil painting is horrible.
9603 2018-01-02 01:24:28 Oil above $60 a barrel - Iran situation and other geo-political risk should support oil prices and see much more upside.
9604 2018-01-02 01:24:25 Mira, Darling! Corinne made an observation about a snake oil salesman who sold us the failing NAFTA package, a Global Warming Hoax, and owns multiple mansions while flying around on private jets. She is entitled to her opinion.
9605 2018-01-02 01:24:09 OIL oh and more OIL oh and uranium gold and electric power that our big once
9606 2018-01-02 01:23:59 Now that the holidays are over all I want is to sit my fat ass on a pool float covered in tanning oil literally BAKING in 90 degree heat

9608 2018-01-02 01:22:39 Yes & no lol. Some parts are more locked than others, considering I only had them a little over a year & my hair texture with the water/oil/conditioner mix makes it a little easier. Just time consuming 
9609 2018-01-02 01:22:08 How did I ever sleep without an oil diffuser.
9610 2018-01-02 01:22:07 Rochelle Lowen 
She best not bring a bag with her otherwise Orton will pour oil and tan in her bag again.
9611 2018-01-02 01:21:56 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
9612 2018-01-02 01:21:56 Everyone is tweeting about #Iranprotests.Please educate yourself about the less fashionable,not rich in oil regimes that USA UK & 
Co-Colonialist allies don't care about. #DRC #Josephkabila & #Sudan #Omaralbashir are two examples of regimes responsible for the death of millions!!
9613 2018-01-02 01:21:45 Mariah Lynn should've gone and gotten a hot oil treatment instead of coming to argue with Self! #LHHNY
9614 2018-01-02 01:21:17 All they're fighting for is to gain access to oil and natural resource deposits. They don't care about the people and the well-being of humanity. They pick on the commoners to feed the greedy needs of the Onclers (the industries and corporations.)
9615 2018-01-02 01:21:09 Given that China is Iran's top export market, and also given that Tehran has denied that anything happened to their pipeline, they want to show that nothing will stop the status quo when it comes to their oil & gas industry. They want to assure China that there's no hiccups.
9616 2018-01-02 01:21:07 Enter 45 Big Oil T-Rex Exxon Republicans & Czar Putin. Offshore oil rigs, Alaskan, Texan & Russian Arctic drilling needs oil >$75-$100. Their problem: how to do it by increments right in every1’s face? Or by “Big Emergency?” A big oil wicked problem.
9617 2018-01-02 01:20:56 There's no shame in admitting that FB is a central pillar to ND.  Father Hesburgh sure didn't have a problem with it:  "Texas has oil. Notre Dame has football. Neither should apologize."  Young alumns defending these results on the field is just a reflection of what ND has lost.
9618 2018-01-02 01:20:15 The region is full of chick peas. No Jew could possibly think to soak them and grind them up into a dip or fry them as a fritter. And using the oil of a fruit that grows everywhere in the region?  Clearly no Jew could think of that.
9619 2018-01-02 01:20:13 I work with EVs every day. No extra oil needed after initial lube. Oil heats up when it moved through the things it is lubricating, so no need for extra heat. 

I'm an engineer dude. You sound like a dumbass and have no idea what you're talking about.

9625 2018-01-02 01:19:26 Part of the problem is our biggest oil companies own foreign interests. Good luck getting them to give it up.

9630 2018-01-02 01:18:43 Anything that has a thick oil base makes hair look darker because the oils portray a thicker effect
9631 2018-01-02 01:18:35 He speaks like we have other uses for our money like helping veterans deal with the aftereffects of war, or setting up safety nets or encouraging small business and startups or idk making sure oil and gas companies don't make local communities unhealthier.

9635 2018-01-02 01:18:19 I have sheet masks, oil cleanser, vitamin C lightning fluid, moisturizer with SPF50, and Benton steam cream. Only need five more products to complete my 10-step #Kbeauty routine. (Can’t believe i’m doing this shit, but it’s kind of fun)
9636 2018-01-02 01:18:09 Thank you!  I love Baby oil and chemical brothers
9637 2018-01-02 01:17:43 Iran is at knifepoint, Venezuelan industry collapsing, oil demand is strong, #OPEC cuts clearly working, inventories depleting as rapid as anytime in history of oil record tracking and this poor fella and his Mortal Combat assassins still banking on the collapse of oil pricing 
9638 2018-01-02 01:17:42 It was. Bro, they created ISIS as a reason to bomb and invade Middle East for oil. All the while, they spread islamaphobia so they get "approved" for their actions.

9651 2018-01-02 01:15:42 @IvankaTrump I asked your father if he could release free energy tech when he gets the swamp drained, the people who work in oil, the actual workers, will need jobs and 3D printing could increase demand for oil.  Could you find a way for them to have jobs as they have bills?
9652 2018-01-02 01:15:37 Lmfaoooo my maintenance lot or abt i put the wrong oil in it 
9653 2018-01-02 01:15:09 First time I ever seen oil was from Blake for $75 a gram. Homie price. Lollll

9655 2018-01-02 01:14:46 Proposed budget cuts that would eliminate programs supporting rural jobs, housing, infrasructure, health care and economic development. Proposed cuts to energy programs that save people money. Eliminated pollution standards for power plants, oil and gas facilities.

9657 2018-01-02 01:14:07 Exactly. That's all political, it's bc of the oil. They only look out for their own interests.
9658 2018-01-02 01:14:04 it could be useful if say someone drives out to the desert and their cars can't follow ... but yeah struggling t ofind a use apart from spending the huge reserves of money from oil
9659 2018-01-02 01:13:57 Good evening guys and gals. Not going to make it on this evening, Working on making sure I am ready for the first actual day of the new year tomorrow. lol As the CAM calendar says I will be on on the 5th Friday! TokenKeno- Strip and Oil show! 
9660 2018-01-02 01:13:36 Airfares didn’t drop much with price of oil. They won’t here either. At $90/bbl fuel was largest cost, but now it is more complicated. A Delta MD90 MSP-SFO, owned outright, is different than a leased 737-900 same route. Less fuel, more airplane cost. My son is also a PPL..

9678 2018-01-02 01:11:48 Supply is limitless in our lifetime.  Saskatchewan Oil sand hasn't even been tapped yet.  Venezuela production is not optimized.
9679 2018-01-02 01:11:46 I now have an 8-year documented and timestamped history of pretty damn good oil market predictions. Luck played a minor role. 15 years of intensive oil market study mattered far more.
9680 2018-01-02 01:11:36 Non-Commercial  means: not profitable at current price. Poor geography. Small size. Bad location. Wrong hydrocarbon mix. Too much/little oil/gas ratio.  To sour, high sulfur. To much water. Many other reasons. Sub-Commercial means could be produced, if we want to, later. Or not.

9694 2018-01-02 01:08:17 I think oil market predicting is mainly luck due to the huge number of import factors, really wide possible outcome space for each factor, & the difficulty of predicting each factor.  There are many more neither of us mentioned like:
+A surprise big conventional oil discovery...
9695 2018-01-02 01:07:50 like grandmas batch of Castor oil
9696 2018-01-02 01:07:37 Watching this thread since it started. Science challenged among us connect “Wicked” or “wicked mess” with alternate realities per movies John Wick#2(Wicked) minus all the fighting. Def. of “W” per Big Oil: female ACC deniers.
9697 2018-01-02 01:07:09 That's a lot of what-ifs and maybes like stock market bombs & pulls commodities ith it. Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me but it's mostly speculation. Empirical facts are that inventories have been falling & oil prices have been rising. That can change but till it does...
9698 2018-01-02 01:07:05 I'm making rose bath melts & chocolate-covered berry melts for Valentine's Day, w/shea butter, sweet almond oil, jojoba oil, raw honey, & extracts. The berry melts also have cocoa butter, cocoa powder, and soy wax. 
9699 2018-01-02 01:07:04 Snag a CPO Volt coming off a lease, will have plenty of miles and years of bumper-to-bumper coverage left.  

After 10k miles and a year of ownership, I’ve paid $0 in maintenance (purchased new tires because I’m OCD). Due for an oil change in 6 months. 110 MPG.
9700 2018-01-02 01:06:42 Yes, Fomblin oil is good too
9701 2018-01-02 01:06:09 This is one way I like to do it. cut in half like a boat, fill with cream cheese and white raw milk cheddar, fry them in virgin olive oil. Sprinkle with garlic and salt or garlic and Tonys cajon seasoning
9702 2018-01-02 01:05:34 ah idk if it'll b much help... but usually i use rosehip oil for my face if i exfoliate too much and it helps w the pain and dry spots. its usually not TOO expensive either (relative to other oils) and goes a long way

9710 2018-01-02 01:04:34 Ice cream and fake butter are not the basics of going plant based.  Try no oil, fresh, whole foods first. The best sub for anything on pancakes and waffles, etc, is fruit/date syrup.
9711 2018-01-02 01:04:33 We Well see this year what happens because of trump besides the oil spills and National parks being opened for corporate rape and more water getting poisoned. He can only ride Obama's tide  for the first year. #BlueTsunami2018
9712 2018-01-02 01:03:58 Did you know you can make fritters with blackeyed peas?  Soak, grind, add ground onion, spices, and a bit of baking powder.  Fry in oil.  REALLY good with pita bread and a spicy mayo-type sauce, or tahini.  Think, redneck falafel.

9727 2018-01-02 01:00:30 You have to think about an evolved *system* when you think about a larger role for storage. If the storage share is large enough, it could also displace enough gas to eliminate any peak-price advantage for oil.

9734 2018-01-02 00:59:51 Sigh. Yes, oil is bad for the environment, thus anything that uses it is not helpful. Still, we could at least start using less plastic.

9738 2018-01-02 00:59:10 graham, mcconn, & other anti-Trump traitors want to get rid of Syria's Assad; so they can have their own oil pipeline in Syria.

US hegemony ends not from a swap currency, or crypto nonsense, or the next crisis. It ends if China turns away from oil and moves to renewables.

9763 2018-01-02 00:53:35 Yeah, and you have to be careful and make sure that your makeup / skin care products are oil free otherwise the lashes fall out faster 
BUT the convenience of not wearing falsies...

9766 2018-01-02 00:52:10 Sounds great. But then you realize we have interests in other countries. For example, oil. Which you and me both use to drive our vehicles. When you have interests, aid and money will always be expended.

9777 2018-01-02 00:50:22 The salicylic acid is great for spot treatments and hyaluronic acid is good for a basic moisturizing/ anti aging! i’d actually start with these two plus rose hip seed oil and see how your skin reacts. you can add acid exfoliants after you adjust!

9788 2018-01-02 00:48:35 Propaganda all is phony if it's from FOX HOUSE formerly known as white house. There ramping up to attack north Korea. Distraction from Mueller's investigation Trump's called out China for giving North Korea oil but is silent on Russia doing the same 
9789 2018-01-02 00:48:34 olive oil on damp skin + body butter = a soft happy Bebe.
9790 2018-01-02 00:48:22 Mix brown sugar and coconut oil/olive oil !!
9791 2018-01-02 00:48:17 หมอกลง นึกว่าฝนตก
9792 2018-01-02 00:48:16 I tell everyone to use the rose hip seed oil, it’s like magic, but depending on how sensitive you are, you can experiment with the granretinoid or the stronger lactic acid for exfoliation/antiaging! both should be used with sunscreen and at night though.
9793 2018-01-02 00:48:02 Trump just wants oil
9794 2018-01-02 00:47:56 Fruit and Vegetables are good. Correct. Cannabis Oil Kills Cancer Cells. #cannabis #cancer #chemo

9798 2018-01-02 00:47:37 Couple of chicken breasts, some asparagus, some prosciutto or serrano ham, some Parmesan cheese

Fry the chicken in olive oil, hot, till it's got a little crisp. Put aside.
Fry the asparagus on a medium heat til the green looks more vivid (thats ready). Put aside.
9799 2018-01-02 00:47:34 Just because your husband would rather drink motor oil than spend 5 minutes talking to your crazy ass, doesn’t mean you have to take it out on Tom. Get help.
9800 2018-01-02 00:47:29 What can go right with mkt in 2018-2020... many reasons . 
Wt can go wrong - Liquidity, oil , Geo political. 
Out of trio of fundamentals , sentiments & liq , it’s liquidity which s key !!!
9801 2018-01-02 00:47:09 Sorry to bother you but wondering if you knew of any way for me to hold atlas Glenmor accountable for letting my oil run out and then pretending their rep who I have been texting with since nov didn’t know who I was. I live in Boston but this regards our home in Ipswich.
9802 2018-01-02 00:46:59 It is cheaper & more reliable however heavy subsidies have been provided to oil because they are donors rather than allowing competition.
9803 2018-01-02 00:46:43 Are you going to raise taxes on the rich & cut oil subsidies to pay for this?  Or are you just going to cut services to poor people again? #cdnpoli
9804 2018-01-02 00:46:33 @potus sells snake oil and will take credit for anything good even if he had nothing to do with it; as for the bad, that’s someone else’s fault. @potus has had too many mini strokes (TIAs) and it shows in his deteriorating rantings.
9805 2018-01-02 00:46:21 You will only be able to keep up the lies for so long. Eventually your voters will figure out that you were bought by big oil and big corporations to give them massive tax cuts. So much for drivable roads, breathable air, drinkable water.
9806 2018-01-02 00:46:19 I use extra virgin olive oil as my make up remover. Coconut oil or coconut based moisturizers are a must for a climate like AZ.  
9807 2018-01-02 00:46:06 2018 the year of coconut oil
9808 2018-01-02 00:45:59 Well, there is a war ongoing, you know that? Like people dying, children starving, forests disappearing, oil, blood, corruption and open slavery, I think we deserve it, a perfect planet soon to be only ash and toxic waste.
9809 2018-01-02 00:45:56 This old man was trying to talk oil and gas with Jill. At one point he says remember in 85 when they changed the tax laws. She tells him she doesn't remember because she was 3.  He immediately left. Getting old is tough.
9810 2018-01-02 00:45:54 凄い。 溜めキャラのDJで、ヴァンパイアのチェーンコンボみたいなことしてる(,,ºΔº,,*)
9811 2018-01-02 00:45:52 And the trickle down scam gets another booster to hype the snake oil
9812 2018-01-02 00:45:35 Efficascent Oil lang sapat na hehe 
9813 2018-01-02 00:45:34 I use olive oil and dales sop. Rubbed it down on Saturday night.
9814 2018-01-02 00:45:34 The guy I'm talking to just asked ME what kind of oil his car takes #Godhelp
9815 2018-01-02 00:45:31 Do you realize what you get from an oil company?

9823 2018-01-02 00:44:27 For a state that claims to be the most sustainable in the nation, MA sure has a lot of homes with oil based energy-sucks. Mine included.
9824 2018-01-02 00:44:22 Iran has oil, it will never be in hands of Iranians!
9825 2018-01-02 00:44:07 That oil down after a shower
9826 2018-01-02 00:44:04 We need the pipelines and let big oil pay for them. In the near future oil will be replaced and then we will need the pipe lines to deliver water. From the north were the water is, to the south were the cities are. This will keep the cost of water down.
9827 2018-01-02 00:44:03 What kind of monster brags about their wealth by attacking someone recovering from a horrible incident such as a house fire? ... Sounds like a very angry, OLD lady whose husband would rather drink motor oil than be near her...
9828 2018-01-02 00:43:55 Trump has never criticized Putin. When Russia’s ship was spotted giving oil to North Korea, Trump ignored it. Didn’t hesitated to call out China for the same act. Agent Orange is turned, and this is very bad for America.
9829 2018-01-02 00:43:33 Funny thing is snake oil salesmen from the 1800s had to change with the times.....and they did....they found politics. The same guy who was conning people back then is today running for office as a Republican.
9830 2018-01-02 00:43:32 @pissNyamouf445
To prevent oncoming colds from spreading to the throat and ears, 
gargle oil of oregano diluted with an olive oil carrier. Then swallow it slowly. It will sting your mucus membranes, but the cold will stay in your head.

9833 2018-01-02 00:43:06 Do those spoiled brats get the windows washed, oil and tires checked too?  Good old days.
9834 2018-01-02 00:42:52 Both teams jerseys must be covered in oil or something because they are impossible to tackle in this game
9835 2018-01-02 00:42:27 I mixed together some shea butter and coconut oil and like to use this as a moisturizer. Just a teeny tiny bit tho because a little goes a long way. Shea butter helps with scars and is a natural sunblock so it will help with hyper-pigmentation.
9836 2018-01-02 00:42:14 This #RoseBowl field is slipperier than oil filled rubber.

9840 2018-01-02 00:42:06 So yes. Oil OVAH Chocolate. Of course painful history has taught, new producers, to enact effective HydroCarbon Laws, to protect, their Pre-Oil Economic Diversity, if any.

9842 2018-01-02 00:41:57 See a dermatologist, drink water, and be strict about your face routine. Routine is vital. I experiment with Oil of Olay, cetaphil, and Mario Badescu products but my routine remains: remove makeup, wash face, toner, moisturize. I exfoliate 2x/week with a St Ives medium exfoliator
9843 2018-01-02 00:41:55 And was born to oil money so success didn’t matter
9844 2018-01-02 00:41:41 Not into intervention at all BUT that seems to be how things are so yes I'm all up for invading Saudi, stealing their oil, emancipating their people and creating a secular Muslim state where all these mythical refugees can live in peace.
And yes steal all their oil again!

9850 2018-01-02 00:40:57 Thank you!  I love Oil Paint, but painting is so slow.  My goal has been for many months to create digital paintings that have the beauty and feel of actual painted pieces.  So many images, so little time... The finished image is all important not the medium.
9851 2018-01-02 00:40:55 And the thread is just bizarre.

9854 2018-01-02 00:40:29 North Sea Oil was projected to run out in 2010, or, at least that’s what I used to teach in social problems. 

Technology helped Norway.

When do you predict food will become a more important a product then oil?

9858 2018-01-02 00:39:54 once you get things cleaned up, THANK YOU FOR THAT-JUST INCREDIBLE JOB! #DrainTheSwamp , could you release free energy tech.  I know many jobs depend on oil, I was thinking we could also release more 3D printing tech thus moving the oil demand into plastics. @IvankaTrump
9859 2018-01-02 00:39:01 When you have a shower then put on dirty clothes that faintly smell like oil 
(coz I'm working on cars, not coz I'm gross xD )
9860 2018-01-02 00:38:51 Big $ diversion is underway, but #okleg is on the ball. They know that #windpower already pays 2.5x heavier tax burden than oil producers. Plus, Oklahoma wind incentives have ended, and oil pays GPT instead of ad valorem! A #GPT for wind? Why should #wind be quintuple-taxed?

9868 2018-01-02 00:37:51 It's unbelievable what they have done and are still doing as they attack our Pres. Attacking Trump is attacking his supporters. Disgraceful
9869 2018-01-02 00:37:18 Or is 32 times just a little bit and not a major enough breach of contract while selling oil to whoever they want?

9873 2018-01-02 00:36:32 Always good to see a sophisticated European looking down his nose at simple Americans. Sanctions, early recognition and financial aid to a new government, investment and expertise in developing Iranian oil, gas and minerals, just to name a few. @AriFleischer #IranProtests
9874 2018-01-02 00:35:58 Exfoliate your face, neck and hands with a mixture of baking soda and olive oil. It is very gentle, and keeps skin very soft and smooth.
9875 2018-01-02 00:35:26 Not just Chocolate. I believe the term Oil Curse came from changes in the Netherlands' economy after the discovery of North Sea Oil, in the 70s. This effect has been noted globally, & repeatedly. In some ways only the US, & RUSSIA, have contained, their HydroCarbon Sectors.

9890 2018-01-02 00:33:38 @AtlasGlenMor you let my oil run out, my pipes froze, & you refused to come out today to fill tank. On top of it, you & your rep refuse to take responsibility for letting it run out in the first place. Beyond disgusted with your company.
9891 2018-01-02 00:33:37 I wish we were back in 1978 &oil industry had released the results of their investigation on environmental impacts. Maybe we...

9898 2018-01-02 00:31:59 Surely someone has made an ominous warning about global population and deforestation too

I'm sure the oil industry has a lot to do with it but you don't have to be a rocket scientist to know deforestation is also killing the earth
Humans are like leeches upon the earth too
9899 2018-01-02 00:31:56 Why not? We bailed the banks out, we bailed car companies out, we provided stimulus packages to oil companies. Hell we can just add it to the deficit. Lord knows we won't live long enough to pay it back any how.

9902 2018-01-02 00:31:17 Well your intelligent first Bush President got us into that over a fight about oil.
9903 2018-01-02 00:31:14 Well when people actually start getting the money back they earned in their own damn paychecks, pretty sure the higher taxes and "free" snake oil you're trying to sell will fall on deaf ears and they'll all be wearing pretty red #MAGA hats.
9904 2018-01-02 00:31:09 Mfw when you give your land to a nation and all you ask is for some oil but instead give an equivalent of "a fuck you" as thanks
9905 2018-01-02 00:30:52 So you expect a piece of paper to stop them from selling oil?

9915 2018-01-02 00:28:20 The people selling this are either remarkably out of touch with the real world or completely aware they're selling "snake oil". My house has a well, I drink raw water every day, nothing special about it.
9916 2018-01-02 00:28:11 The ability to sell oil. How many times do I have to repeat this?
9917 2018-01-02 00:28:07 I have a feeling that the midnight oil is already burning at The Pentagon Ray, But your point is spot on as far as that being a critical weakness of Iran!

9923 2018-01-02 00:26:24 Oh don't you worry.  Once Saudi radicalism takes place - and you just know it will considering the events taking place there due to a devaluation of their oil - the armchair "the West supports the Saudi clerics" position will vanish into silence just like that.
9924 2018-01-02 00:26:12 Oil - olive oil, baby oil, etc - just a little bit on a cotton bud at first then wash it off
9925 2018-01-02 00:26:10 I’m done with the Oil for a while. Heading to Marmot for a week. Good weather. Good snow. See ya out there for a few turns!
9926 2018-01-02 00:25:53 The accusers are the media houses bought by Arab oil money. So it's no wonder that a guy who has a tough line on Islam would be hounded by muslims and their stooges.

For example , @CNN , has a huge setup in Dubai and programming on the Gulf makes up a large part of their content
9927 2018-01-02 00:25:50 Happy New Year, 2018 the year the Dems get their voice and priorities clear and for the people.  Now is the time to find excellent candidates with a clear REAL message for ALL people.  We must show our heart and soul because Trump is the great snake oil salesman Dems must be real
9928 2018-01-02 00:25:37 I’m sorry but screw this 30 degree weather. I wanna be wearing a bikini on the beach, with tanning oil on my panza, eating some pineapples 
9929 2018-01-02 00:25:28 Im not taking my wig off because i accidently put too much castor oil on it so now i look greasy w/o it !
9930 2018-01-02 00:24:57 cause they don't have OIL $$$$like Saudi or Iraq
9931 2018-01-02 00:24:47 Mr. Chubb had oil on his jersey. That’s why he couldn’t be tackled.
9932 2018-01-02 00:24:29 Call and call again to voice your concerns.
The sueaky wheel gets the oil!!!
9933 2018-01-02 00:24:24 Does it beat my old but not missed 2002 Audi A4 1.8t quattro? I had to carry spare ignition coils and a case of oil in the trunk because it burned a quart a week and almost monthly it'd burn out a coil as if on cue.
9934 2018-01-02 00:24:21 Swap the bubble bath for pool, the lotion and baby oil for a beer, the chapstick for a cigar and I agree with you.. 
9935 2018-01-02 00:24:10 Because they have oil
9936 2018-01-02 00:24:04 Dat nigga Chubb got baby oil on his legs or sum.
9937 2018-01-02 00:23:38 laying cold hands on himself.
And his two little jiminies, cousins of ourn, Tristopher and Hilary, were kickaheeling their dummy on the oil cloth flure of his homerigh,
9938 2018-01-02 00:23:35 Their greatest invention is... shrimp chips!
They take shrimp, cut them up into paper-thin pieces, and then heat them in some kind of oil, and it makes them crunchy and delicious!
9939 2018-01-02 00:23:33 So now your news is Trump Tweeting about protestors. It has been 5 days and this is your coverage. My friends and I have been posting hundreds of videos under your twits. but no you don't care. Because oil cartel is paying good!
9940 2018-01-02 00:23:28 Anything well oiled needs an oil change every 10,000 miles - or 5,000 in severe conditions. Republics should always consult their owner’s manuals.
9941 2018-01-02 00:23:24 #LegacyExploration estimates WTI (oil) prices at $65 by end of first quarter 2018 and natural gas prices at $3.  @Citi @GoldmanSachs, let’s hear what you folks are saying....Thank God we didn’t listen to you guys last year! 
9942 2018-01-02 00:23:21 Pretty sure when the oil companies blast prices up $0.20/L for the May long weekend that the #UCP won't be putting out a fear mongering statement to the companies about their 500% increase compared to the carbon tax hike. But yeah...keep it up #UCP. #rollseyes
9943 2018-01-02 00:23:12 Now that oil revenue is decreasing, looks like the Saudis are coming down to earth and wanting to be part of the broader world. Being aloof and segregated takes you only that far. Finally the Saudis are learning to shed the burqa and integrate.
9944 2018-01-02 00:22:58 rose oil in the diffuser,
rose oil on my body,
rose hand lotion on my cuticles,
life is rosy.
9945 2018-01-02 00:22:54 Loaded up and ran the dishwasher. Found ONE ant. Sprayed everything down with mint oil water. Found my mint oil vial empty, so I’ll need to pick up more. Took out trash. Tomorrow will be fridge clean out and more dishes day. #adulting
9946 2018-01-02 00:22:44 That said, the biggest threat to cocoa now is Ye Olde Oil Curse. Hydrocarbon production has begun OFFSHORE. It will be interesting to see if the non-oil part of the economy is "crowded out", by Petro-Cedis.
9947 2018-01-02 00:22:37 The only reason that Denmark, Sweden, and Norway's socialist systems are still viable is the tremendous amount of money they get off of taxes from offshore oil production and drilling. Without "capitalist money" to sustain their vision, they would be like Venezuela in six months.
9948 2018-01-02 00:22:19 Everyone in the Oil Business that's who

9950 2018-01-02 00:21:59 An oil painting fueled by cryptocurrency 2.
9951 2018-01-02 00:21:57 I'd like to oil and fuck you, man.
9952 2018-01-02 00:21:30 No my argument is that Iran doesn't need US permission or anybody else's to sell oil. There are countries who will happily invest in oil.
9953 2018-01-02 00:21:30 For real, lil salt, pepper and Olive oil then roasted in the oven at 500 is 
9954 2018-01-02 00:21:25 Yeah! And why not enforce sanctions on countries that interfere in our elections and supply oil to NK, too!
9955 2018-01-02 00:21:24 Working on an oil rig is where the money is
9956 2018-01-02 00:21:19 Dunno. I spent over 3 hours the other day priming it and it never turned back on. I came home this morning and it primed instantly but keeps shutting off every half hour or so. I have enough oil but I’ll stop by the store tomorrow to get a new filter to see if that’s the issue.
9957 2018-01-02 00:21:17 Nobody's arguing in front of a judge here. This is a contract, not a prosecution. I'm saying that we've created a contract that makes Iran choose between having nukes and selling oil, and China choose between breaking sanctions and losing power.
9958 2018-01-02 00:20:48 Okay @Citi and @GoldmanSachs, what do you have for us this year?  If you want a beat on oil prices, instead of consulting your analysts, consult a panel of oil and gas executives.  We nailed it last year at $60 by year end and that statement was made in Jan 2017.  
9959 2018-01-02 00:20:40 Well when you screw over your former benefactor from oil they had always had access to oil which they and most of the modern world are dependent on how would you feel? They wouldn't cut any deal and they should have been expecting what came next because of that

9963 2018-01-02 00:19:58 I am so excited to see what you bring for the new year! You have made dirty air and burning rivers back! Next up. . . Massive oil leaks and ?

9965 2018-01-02 00:19:38 You relelize China trading on us and is selling them oil when they are “enemy’s”
9966 2018-01-02 00:19:29 You equated jaywalking to drug dealing in hopes that compared to illegal oil selling but only "a little bit".
9967 2018-01-02 00:19:26 essential oil diffusers are so good
9968 2018-01-02 00:19:19 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
9969 2018-01-02 00:19:04 There is only one problem, this government claimed it had deregulated the oil sector with the increase to N145. Market forces should then push prices up or down as the case may be. However, all that turned out to be false
9970 2018-01-02 00:19:04 I see a lot of coconut oil in your future 
9971 2018-01-02 00:18:57 (#^-^)ﾒﾗﾒﾗ…
9972 2018-01-02 00:18:34 Auto shops are weak for being closed today. I had to change the car oil myself
9973 2018-01-02 00:18:27 way oil. Run the lathe - put on your skin, put in your mouth
9974 2018-01-02 00:18:26 My car had no oil in it
9975 2018-01-02 00:17:41 What's wrong with coconut oil
9976 2018-01-02 00:17:39 heh. Red sauce did not sound so good with rice. I wonder if a simple olive oil and garlic type sauce would. I might have to try it sometime. (Good luck and no ER visits.)
9977 2018-01-02 00:17:32 We used to give our pup coconut oil ice cubes and it did wonders for her fur and skin which was in crap condition from her previous owners

Psalm 92:10
But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
9979 2018-01-02 00:17:30 If someone sees me outside with greasy hair... that’s coconut oil. Your gurl takes care of her hair somehow 
9980 2018-01-02 00:17:11 ههههههههههههههههه البطل ماعجبني غيروه :(
9981 2018-01-02 00:16:58 If your argument is that Iran would rather be North Korea than a rich oil country, I don't know what to tell you. But at least with the deal they have to make that choice; they didn't before.
9982 2018-01-02 00:16:43 Why does Rulo keep oil under his microwave @miv5014 ?
9983 2018-01-02 00:16:24 Cooked in coconut oil, topped with butter.  Exactly four unpopped kernels!!!
9984 2018-01-02 00:16:16 Olive oil. Put on your skin, Put in your mouth.
9985 2018-01-02 00:16:10 Use coconut oil
9986 2018-01-02 00:16:04 He wants the oil
9987 2018-01-02 00:15:56 Mortgage the house, drain the above-ground pool, purchase a drum of coconut oil and schedule the most epic lesbian free for all the wank cranking throngs have ever seen.
9988 2018-01-02 00:15:45 Coconut oil is the best skin care decision I’ve made.
9989 2018-01-02 00:15:30 ps3ですか。わかりました明日やりましょう。ra_oilまでフレンド申請送ってください
9990 2018-01-02 00:15:22 have to confess, I'm putting cocoanut as oil on myself right now.
9991 2018-01-02 00:15:10 Man, I know we should have converted to gas and yadda yadda yadda, but I tell you, a fuel oil delivery on New Year's Day when it's monster cold like this is a gift and a good omen.

今年もよろしくお願いします！！
9993 2018-01-02 00:14:26 Que? At the moment oil is costing us to extract & there are huge decommissioning costs.
9994 2018-01-02 00:14:12 Good news to start the year! Btw, anyone have an idea, besides Putin wants it that way, why oil hasn’t come down since the end of September?

9996 2018-01-02 00:13:27 That's been my entire point. "At what point does Iran say we want nukes more than oil profits?". Probably sooner than later given the envir

9998 2018-01-02 00:13:05 I have a really good lime cilantro cauliflower rice recipe. It does call for an onion fried in olive oil, but only pinches of pink Himalayan sea salt. ;)
9999 2018-01-02 00:12:51 Hi. Ive been using apple cider vinegar and peppermint oil. I just pour a little of each on a cotton puff then dabbing the puff across the cysts. It's only been a week and I've already noticed a huge difference. The cysts have shrunk
10000 2018-01-02 00:12:49 Please know that many Americans are so sorry and ashamed of what these people in the name of our country has done.We have also lost many soldiers for the sake of the NWOs greed,oil,and poppy fields.Trump has given us the truth .
10001 2018-01-02 00:12:40 I love how everyone in the Benjamin household has invited themselves to use my coconut oil
10002 2018-01-02 00:12:26 Unless they have an abundance of oil, Muslim countries always fail. Just as communist countries have always failed. China is not a true communist country, but more of an authoritarian country.
10003 2018-01-02 00:12:19 You are something else mate , it’s not only oil that the mansour businesses is built on . Check his business portfolio .... think bro
10004 2018-01-02 00:12:14 Sorry, my pork chops were done.
Not only GE.
Most major corporations are subsidized by the government and very few have ever paid the full rate you quoted.
When oil was at close to $200 a barrel, they were still receiving government subsidies.
So, I picked a side.
Your come back?
10005 2018-01-02 00:11:34 It was a coup and a dictature (yes suppression of political speech is dictature). Not legitimate. It was legitimate under the election of Mossadegh. And his reforms were far better. Pahlavi was liked by the US govmt because of his oil donations, as always.
10006 2018-01-02 00:11:31 Ohhh come on... you ignore much worse shit going on in Saudi Arabia and Qatar... AHH I forgot.... they are "special" ))) they sell oil ... Hypocrisy
10007 2018-01-02 00:11:26 Anyone know where to get home made coconut oil used  for massaging?
10008 2018-01-02 00:11:26 All one has to do is look at the connection between Saudi Arabia and terrorism. All the fanatical moslem groups are Sunni, not Shi'a. And the US, UK, and Israel are all sucking up to Saudi oil and money.
10009 2018-01-02 00:11:20 I clearly LOVE the #Stocks $ES_F... but anyone that really knows me knows I prefer #Commodities this year... I think the classics #Gold $GC_F & #Oil $CL_F will be most popular, but the commodity currencies like $AUD $NZD $CAD will benefit as well from this money flow.
10010 2018-01-02 00:11:13 spit, there is no olive oil in its aurora
10011 2018-01-02 00:11:13 (( Sadly, I don't own either, and I'm still figuring out my comfort level for Workshop games. But Snake Oil looks like it has the potential for really silly, light roleplay! Neat!

I've been meaning to pick up Betrayal in meatspace, and I'm warming to that grey area. :) ))

10013 2018-01-02 00:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: chewy crust with chunky motor oil and philly beef.
10014 2018-01-02 00:10:47 Bung your spuds in, switch it on low all day. Literally that. I just put the tiniest bit of oil in to stop them sticking, & if they are particularly large then I’ll turn them. The flesh can go a yellowish colour but don’t be put off! Yummy!
