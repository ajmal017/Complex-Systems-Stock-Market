9 2018-05-09 23:13:03 It becomes better and better as things function as interchangeable commodities with nothing holding back arbitrary amounts of production. With land, this clearly isn't the case; production of land within an urban core is zero; returns to landownership is all unearned rent.
10 2018-05-09 23:03:55 Is this a manifestation of the swagger—the muscular diplomacy—promised by President Trump’s new Secretary of State? South Sudan’s leaders needn’t be allowed to continue to view their own people as the expendable commodities that fuel the senseless civil war.
11 2018-05-09 22:58:48 The rate at which prices of commodities are rising have slowed down to such a level?; then we should be experiencing price in the coming months!
12 2018-05-09 22:58:29 Basic economics on commodities: China is buying soybeans from the US because we give them the best deal. If they want to spend more money buying soybeans from Brazil that's their business. The US will just sell its soy beans to Brazil's customers.
13 2018-05-09 22:49:34 No doubt about that. Completely agree. True shut-down corners (if such a thing even exists anymore with all the rule changes favoring offenses) are extremely rare commodities. That’s why we have to start him off there. Guys with that speed, size, and length are RARE

42 2018-05-09 21:59:36 European bond market would do it. Capital flees Europe for both USD and some commodities. A weak Euro narrative rather than strong dollar narrative pushing up DXY
43 2018-05-09 21:54:27 Not to mention rising wages and other input costs (commodities), they called it peak margins for a reason
44 2018-05-09 21:49:16 It's also more profitable but mainly because of govt subsidies and marketing via Check-off programs to keep the factory farm system thriving. It's horrifying how we've turned animals into commodities. Factory farms are modern day concentration camps for animals. It has to end.
45 2018-05-09 21:45:18 @INCIndia is down to earth to do politics in cheap manner instead they kept the prices of commodities, inflation in an costly side.@Narendramodi_PM is still digging the well to identify the malpractices since 2013, not yet finished on accounting the looting of previou govt

56 2018-05-09 21:09:11 C’mon Bonge, if we can do 10 year projections on commodities and funding for Gonski and the NDIS, we can do 7 year projections for tax. Plus most indicators on their budgets so far have come out *better than predicted*. Oh and a three-tiered tax system isn’t a ‘flat tax’.

61 2018-05-09 20:32:08 Why do they teach undergrads about signs + signifieds with saussure and not marx on prices + commodities.
62 2018-05-09 20:28:38 Regardless of how commodities are priced, EMs still need USD because they have $3-4T of dollar denominated debt they owe creditors and of those creditors are expecting USD.
63 2018-05-09 20:25:46 el tema es que industria como tal no existe, al menos para exportar, a no ser commodities y poca cosa más, pero con poco valor agregado.
64 2018-05-09 20:16:57 Hi Brian,in your opinion does technical analysis work better with commodities than stocks?
65 2018-05-09 20:12:26 Jajajaja. La venta de los commodities(materias primas, precios del cobre) y el consumo interno con tarjetas de créditos mueven la pequeña economía en Chile. El resto no existe sólo negocios truchos? Concesionarias!!!
66 2018-05-09 20:12:08 All commodities? Think drivers for gold would be very different than copper for instance.
67 2018-05-09 20:06:02 I dont believe in this exchange idea. People are people, they are not commodities.
68 2018-05-09 19:58:27 If commodities are only priced in USD, the $7T in USD FX reserves are needed by EM's.  If they are priced in other currencies, that $7T is much lower & will get marked "return to sender" & sent back to the US; this is inflationary.
69 2018-05-09 19:54:54 i totally get the need for a strong roster of available players in playoffs season, but something about the strategy (?) of hiding players’ injured status until postseason reminds me that sports culture necessitates the treatment of bodies as commodities / tools

78 2018-05-09 19:14:33 A university official told me recently that liberal arts degrees are expected to be the next hot educational commodities due to an expected coming need for creative problem solvers. No, it wasn’t a liberal arts school official saying it.

107 2018-05-09 17:53:55 Actually for the last 3 to 4 years our crops like  cotton,vegetables,edible oils& fruits r under pressure of low productions

Dozens of clubs with 70+ history become valuable commodities. It highlights what we’ve been doing wrong. 

That’s why #ProRelforUSA has to be stopped.
125 2018-05-09 16:57:52 Muy bueno, Juan!
Comparto la similitud del escenario de USA con el período de Bush de los 1ros años del milenio: un escenario con tasas algo más altas pero con commodities en valores todavía altos
126 2018-05-09 16:54:26 Me parece que la combinación de la dinámica del peso de enero a mediados de abril, como bien mencionas, junto con la caída de algunos commodities (agrícolas y varios metales) le ha ayudado bastante. También hay un efecto de base importante que vimos en enero. Saludos!
127 2018-05-09 16:51:36 I really like Jim Roger’s book on commodities.

135 2018-05-09 16:32:39 My guess: Argentina exports a lot of agricultural commodities and invoice  them also in US$. But these Fx reserves are hoarded by a small landlord oligarchy in bed with the ruling government and not shared with the rest of the population. Thus US$ Fx reserves are scarce.

139 2018-05-09 16:29:36 @ProfFaustus @JimmyWinMedia just watched videos from @UniofExeter.. brilliant! Quick follow up question, one hurdle I see to mass adoption is the tax implications of commodities and capital gains imposed by thieves such as ATO & IRS. Do you see this being relaxed in the future?

141 2018-05-09 16:28:49 Concordo plenamente. Nem para um lado, tampouco para o outro. Uma sucessão de erros grosseiros. O default de 2001 fez o país perder a oportunidade de formar reservas com o “boom” das commodities, enquanto o Brasil foi ao FMI em 2004 e formou seu colchão de liquidez.
142 2018-05-09 16:23:11 Political parties are busy throwing dirt at each other. They are not bothered abt the development, environment, condition of the roads, fuel prices, essential commodities prices etc.
143 2018-05-09 16:17:14 I left Facebook too, right after it was revealed that people using Facebook are commodities.  I found it so depressing to learn too much information about people I care about via their posts.  Glad to be done with it.

145 2018-05-09 16:10:52 @arunjaitley Petrol, diesel and CNG  should remain out of GST if GST on other commodities can be 0-10%.
146 2018-05-09 16:09:00 Bread is part of the basic commodities, and from the little economics I’ve studied, the price changes in such commodities matter a lot. Some may consider it as inflation, hence the Central Bank may need to clarify. Remember it may be a signal of much, it’s not to be ignored.

157 2018-05-09 15:33:45 Something to note on the Iran deal, Iran was selling their oil on the black market, Obama later found out the proceeds were funding terrorism. The Nuclear Deal required Iran to be transparent in all exporting of commodities. This essentially allows them to fund terrorism. Again.

166 2018-05-09 15:17:56 Im essentially describing an international CPI. The problem with this is that choosing the commodities for the basket of prices is a politicized process. Eventually 'someone' has to update this basket over time. I am theorizing about an international CPI that would self-adjust.

177 2018-05-09 14:19:15 We’ve already had a pretty good run for commodities, where global growth has increased and the dollar has fell.

While the supply story over longer term is still good, over a tactical period I think Slowing global growth and now a rising dollar acts as a meaningful headwind.

195 2018-05-09 13:30:22 Not really. Economy is at full employment; wages are going up; stock market wealth creation are some of the reasons for higher gas prices. More demand for commodities, like oil. Iran is just noise, but another reason for crude oil traders to keep buying the commodity.
196 2018-05-09 13:29:48 Technology is making the cost of commodities to be known by EVERYONE. Alibaba and the rest have made people aware of the cost of almost anything. We may need to reconsider over-quoting tenders so much. Can't continue forever.

Reason being Iran then has limited markets to import from...

241 2018-05-09 09:06:22 Commodities are the opium of the people.
242 2018-05-09 09:02:15 India has adopted gbal capitalist economy. It was humans as commodities they exported worldwide since the beginning of the 20th century. Then they improved this commodity by educating them for export and colleges thus became 'factories'. Now there is glut of commodity worldwide.

245 2018-05-09 08:52:04 #Brent crude oil prices tick up to almost US$77/b today - up by just a few dollars/barrel compared with recent weeks. This confirms our view that the market had largely priced in a US withdrawal from the #Iran deal.
246 2018-05-09 08:43:33 I wouldn't expect you to understand. As you said in an earlier tweet, these animals are just disposable commodities. I imagine that people who farm dogs and horses for a living are also puzzled by the idea of a dog or horse sanctuary.
247 2018-05-09 08:42:37 I'm getting more and more bearish on global growth. Markets significantly underestimate how tandem of rising oil/commodities/yields + tarrifs/trade tensions/Middle East + EM pull-back will impact consumer and corporates. And this time, there is no rescue from MonPol.
248 2018-05-09 08:42:15 It's That and other Players and Commodities involved.

252 2018-05-09 08:34:20 Now that's a joke and a half.Drugs,neglect,destroying dogs with treatable injuries,all par for the course.Dogs as commodities.
253 2018-05-09 08:32:53 The industry is discredited,cruel,sees the dogs as commodities.The dogs are only of use when making money.Tracks are not natural environment,many sustain treatable injuries but are destroyed due to cost.I would say that the trainers,owners ,don't care.
254 2018-05-09 08:25:39 How's it going for the people of Greece, Spain and a Portugal who aren't riding on the same gravy train as you? How's the price hikes that put up prices of everyday commodities for the Portuguese when businesses upped their prices at the change over to the Euro?
255 2018-05-09 08:20:25 I recall commodities rising with gold. But I'm sure there are slices of interesting periods probably less statistically significant marking periods of confusion. Like now.

In addition, Djibouti has bilateral trade  and cooperation agreements with Kenya #TransformingDiplomacyKenya
261 2018-05-09 07:48:34 How delusional are these people to think they could even change a fraction of the demand for commonly purchased commodities?
262 2018-05-09 07:47:57 Yogendra ji. Surplus tomatoes, LEHSUN, onion, potatoes etc cause heavy loss for farmers when prices crash. At this time why don't you request farmer friendly Baba Ram dev ji to collect such commodities directly for Patanjali for own food processor units having glut for the items?
263 2018-05-09 07:42:42 Blatantly blatant appeasement that has become the hallmark. Look at their impenitent and temerarious attitude. The centrists are wearing horse blinders. Hindus are second grade citizens in our own country and are mere vote banks. We are expendable commodities for everyone.

270 2018-05-09 06:49:46 Working with and for the people of this country is obviously an onerous task for Theresa May’s Government . Hence privatisation . Making health , justice and public safety purchasable commodities . That makes our government a parasitic entity and endangers everyone .
271 2018-05-09 06:48:41 Is it possible to inclusion of Petrol and Diesel under GST. If so the basic cost of all commodities will come down. All people like to do this and waiting for a standard price for all items.
272 2018-05-09 06:45:49 I'm struck by, what seems to me to be, the sheer number of anti-capitalists who spend all their time worrying about de-platforming speakers and punching "nazis" but seem to have never heard the "labour theory" or the "fetishization of commodities", etc. Lids these days. . .

275 2018-05-09 06:21:20 That's one of the 1st things that came to my mind after @realDonaldTrump announcement. If European companies halt Iran deals, will Russia & China pick up these deals as more reliable partners ? Goldman Sacks are saying "sell equities and buy cash & commodities" ie Oil.
