52 2018-11-07 23:43:57 Sessions gets fired and $pyx makes a clear transition away from tobacco into MJ and stocks got down 9%. Makes sense.
53 2018-11-07 23:42:27 Stock market gains today were driven by health care stocks based on the elimination of fears that healthcare coverage would be damaged.
54 2018-11-07 23:40:49 I don’t understand how all of these stocks I’m into keep beating their profit estimates at the quarterly earnings call yet their share price still falls because of “weak” forecast growth. Some of yall investors are wack, just let the stocks be great.
55 2018-11-07 23:39:35 Trump fires Sessions. Stocks jump 500. Post hoc, ergo propter hoc?
56 2018-11-07 23:39:30 I can actually explain that.
Their search engine is mainly dedicated to stocks, economy and current affairs. It **can** do other shit but for the most part this is it.
57 2018-11-07 23:39:25 If stocks are already good they like it even more: they won't be able to undo Trump's pro-growth policy.
58 2018-11-07 23:39:10 Thoughts on bump stocks?
59 2018-11-07 23:38:33 Man, weed stocks are getting high.
60 2018-11-07 23:37:54 #WWH looks like it's rising which is no surprise as largely invested in US Health Stocks.
61 2018-11-07 23:36:54 Not necessarily. A study we did looking at the stocks with the biggest market cap within each sector significantly underperformed those with the best value scores.
62 2018-11-07 23:36:52 Watching #Peston on ITV. Health Secretary explaining that the government is preparing for a shortage of medicine after Brexit and is asking the pharmaceutical industry to get ready and create stocks...just crazy!
63 2018-11-07 23:35:21 Unfortunately seeing the reoccurring theme of no rise on the #TSX for long stretches and then still participating in sell-offs. Big day for the #Dow today, up over 500 pts and barely a blip from CAD #stocks.
64 2018-11-07 23:32:52 Sessions is out. This is good for the pot stocks.
65 2018-11-07 23:30:45 Marijuana stocks high.

68 2018-11-07 23:30:11 What we want from Ultimate is for faster stocks to be more common, instead of a rare occurrence that fucks you over from bad programming.
69 2018-11-07 23:29:16 Yes every smash game has had cheese, but S4's cheese comes from inconsistency, not being an overall broken game (brawl). In Melee, you have 4 stocks, and each stock is expected to go quick. In S4, you have two, and can still die at 0% almost completely randomly.
70 2018-11-07 23:29:15 Stocks had a huge day today.
71 2018-11-07 23:29:04 They want putting in stocks for us all to go and have a go at them see how they like it .
72 2018-11-07 23:28:55 Twenty-nine of the 30 Dow industrial stocks climbed, putting in Blue-Chip index 2.4 percent off its October record.

Penny stocks are very cyclical
77 2018-11-07 23:22:32 I’m guessing our trinity portfolios will underperform US stocks regularly. 

Including underperforming multiple years in a row, for potentially hundreds of percentage points, and possibly for an entire decade or more...
78 2018-11-07 23:21:16 Yeah we gave 1.5 trillion to apple and amazon so they could buy their stocks back I don’t wanna ever hear any budget hawks talking about “where does the money come from?”
79 2018-11-07 23:20:50 I think cuz limited stocks  let me know if you have requested Universal store to CDJ
80 2018-11-07 23:20:45 To be fair, the whole market plunged last week. But I’m a fan of US pot stocks. Another pro with US Pot stocks is many are OTC stocks & that keeps institutional investors & their smart computers & algos out of investing. So they’re actually also pretty easy trades to predict.
81 2018-11-07 23:19:33 Any good links on where to even go to begin to learn n get started in pot stocks? I know I wanna invest in Aurora and canopy and i know nothing farther any help be great!

84 2018-11-07 23:18:52 Sorry to hear you missed out - we increase our stocks dramatically on such offer days, but as you can imagine, we never know exactly how many people will come to store, so these offers are always on a first come, first served basis. Hope you get to try these treats soon Clare 
85 2018-11-07 23:18:47 It looks as if the time around midterm elections is the best time to invest in stocks and other securities.
86 2018-11-07 23:17:31 My marijuana stocks went wild after Sessions was fired. Stocks, in general, are looking great, which is a general statement of a good economy. I plan to do my part in helping to stimulate the economy.
87 2018-11-07 23:16:46 OF COURSE THE DAY I BUY PUT OPTIONS FOR WEED STOCKS IT PICKS UP OVER 10% AS AN INDUSTRY FML
88 2018-11-07 23:16:42 Yep. And then they replenish the stocks.
89 2018-11-07 23:16:16 I used to play with penny stocks, but haven’t really done too much past few years. You like Robinhood?
90 2018-11-07 23:14:51 U.S. stocks extended a recent rebound, advancing as a congressional power worries swift policy changes that could hurt large companies!
91 2018-11-07 23:13:54 Haha the banks are investing in pot stocks. Better than bit coin. I invest in race horses they are honest and real
92 2018-11-07 23:13:20 NEW YORK CITY [Morningstar with AAP]: US stocks have surged as investors piled into growth sectors such as technology and healthcare on relief that the outcome of the midterm elections was as expected.
93 2018-11-07 23:12:13 If you're only seeing bullish signs on stocks/markets when they're green, you're missing out on some super buy opportunities.
94 2018-11-07 23:11:43 Can I pass on that line of inquiry  I would rather help you do one of these: 1. Buy Airtime 2. Pay Bills 3. Funds transfer 4. Loans 5. Account Opening 6. Account statement 7. Account Balance 8. Products 9. Customer Support 10. Stocks 11. Weather forecast
95 2018-11-07 23:11:39 Bummed. Red day losing $30. You either win or learn. Today I learned not to long stocks, I suck at it. And also don’t trade if you don’t have the time. $NAKD my plan was to SS risking 2.00. Got in some and made a little and then it bounced. I added per my plan. But then it was
96 2018-11-07 23:11:17 I would love to pick your brain on how you figure out how these stocks are about to take off
97 2018-11-07 23:09:34 With or without Sessions, owning top Canadian pot stocks now is a no-brainer.
98 2018-11-07 23:09:18 Excellent news! Now to find a Sainsburys in West Yorkshire which stocks them....
99 2018-11-07 23:09:11 This is me.  I actually have 11k, but I only started 3 years ago. At least my employer has decent matching. Soon I'm going to have to get some stocks.
100 2018-11-07 23:08:01 Canna stocks are up today
101 2018-11-07 23:07:25 C'mon. Stocks got high after the news. Or blazed up.
102 2018-11-07 23:06:55 A little birdie told me (Charot!), pag 50 cents na lang daw ang stocks ng xurpas
103 2018-11-07 23:06:26 Stocks up 545 points!
104 2018-11-07 23:05:45 Today is the best day for stocks since the 2018 midterms
105 2018-11-07 23:05:31 Thank you Democrats, my stocks just went up.
106 2018-11-07 23:04:44 Eh right. But I'm betting on Cannabis stocks right now. It's showing some good signs
107 2018-11-07 23:04:20 INTEGRITY???? what would you know about that... YOU MARRIED A RUSSIAN LOBBYIST ! ! ! session's family has PRISON STOCKS they're getting rich off the exaggerated border crisis you have NO integrity

109 2018-11-07 23:03:48 So, my cannabis stocks are up on the news that Sessions is gone.

Still, call your Senators. Tell them they need to protect Mueller. Call them today. Call them tomorrow. This is a crisis.

You can smoke all that legal weed that's coming your way after we save Mueller.

111 2018-11-07 23:02:26 You know @DavidGFool, on days like today, when I break my personal record for "one day percentage increase in my portfolio" (thanks Twillio and others)...
I think... sometimes stocks go up FASTER than they go down. But just sometimes. Great day! 
112 2018-11-07 23:01:50 U.S. stocks closes far higher Wednesday,11/07/18: $DJIA +2.13% at 26,180.30, $SPX +2.12% at 2,813.89, $COMPQ +2.64% at 7,570.75, $RUT +1.67% at $1582.16.
113 2018-11-07 23:01:16 Who's interested in buying some stocks?
114 2018-11-07 23:00:53 No one. Cover climate change, and stop with the 1.5 hours of Wall Street talk & cooking. That is not Seattle. Seattle used to be a city of environmentalists. Now KUOW says it sweets & stocks. My money goes to KNKX.

I think some corporate type is paying you to run Marketplace.

Sky high valuation with years to get revenues up. I’ll stick to beer stocks !
117 2018-11-07 22:58:25 I’m not surprised. It’s disheartening but motivating. The forest and the fish stocks are at risk in Alaska . People like me will have to fight harder and find different ways to make money. So be it.
118 2018-11-07 22:57:57 Jeff Sessions’ forced resignation came before the closing bell, just in time for all my WEED index stocks to celebrate. Hey, how about we grow the medicinal marijuana economy instead or stifling it.

121 2018-11-07 22:57:28 When negative gearing goes - New rental housing stocks will fall for renters & current rents will rise & more people will hence rely more  on the Govt investment in public housing or rental assistance. Labor’s approach does not look at full picture.

126 2018-11-07 22:52:06 Yeah, I didnmt like that. But this time it’s the time and not stocks and only one minute not 33% of the time that’s less.
127 2018-11-07 22:51:38 I am building a database with all the  stocks that spiked multiple times in a year. I know this sounds crappy to follow but if I want to be  early before they spike again then I need to have a database like this. I guess this will be use as swing trade for me

141 2018-11-07 22:37:06 @Techcenterr what do you think about virtual reality stocks?
142 2018-11-07 22:36:31 all bearish etfs are on support and stocks are into major resistance
143 2018-11-07 22:36:23 mañana otro informe #usda, el tema es la demanda sobre #soja #eeuu, ahí se juegan las fichas, y logicamente impacto sobre stocks finales.
144 2018-11-07 22:36:01 actually it's recreational only in Mich, and medical in utah and miss.  but yeah agreed pot stocks still have a loooong way to run

145 2018-11-07 22:35:44 End of contentious cycle, clarity of agenda presents itself... plus...
1. Colorado Prop 112 fails
2. CA Prop 8 goes down
3. Gridlock unlikely to bring dramatic change to Healthcare. 

Stocks would have rallied if GOP won house because of above 3 etc... just the same.
146 2018-11-07 22:35:14 wow stocks! Santa rally coming? WSJ: Today was SP500’s third-largest percentage gain ever in a day following an Election Day. It was the largest gain in a day following an Election Day since 1982.
147 2018-11-07 22:34:49 Both $SPY and $QQQ did a gap-n-go (above 200 day MA) with a >+2% move today. Which continues a violent reversal of recent falls. Will be interesting to see how well UK stocks respond in next few days. Still volatile environment though.
148 2018-11-07 22:34:09 US stocks have surged as investors piled into growth sectors such as technology and healthcare on relief that the outcome of the midterm elections was as expected.

156 2018-11-07 22:33:00 Why the heck everyone is wanting 3 stocks and 8 minutes again AT THIS MOMENT smh

Y'all seriously thought Smash 4 would be flooded of timeouts with 3stocks/8mins or something like that?

I'm 90% certain For Glory had to do with this, 2 stocks 6 mins is a terrible format.
157 2018-11-07 22:32:43 I’m still short on SP500 purely based on the over valued tech stocks and ultimately the debt timebomb. However I can’t imagine a demo house will agree more business friendly policies so this may still correct when hype calms down a bit
158 2018-11-07 22:32:32 Not sure but this should definitely be a good week especially for the pot stocks
159 2018-11-07 22:31:49 Stocks crash 2 weeks before elections... up today over 500 points... WHAT happened... isn't that one thing the democrats aren't capable of accomplishing!
160 2018-11-07 22:31:48 Pot stocks alone went up after Resignation.

“I’m so sorry for your loss Pete, I can’t imagine the pain you’re going through.”
168 2018-11-07 22:27:11 Very true .. stocks drift up over long term while others like FX oscillate from one side to the other over long term.
169 2018-11-07 22:27:04 Stock arriving in pharmacy today (aside from the many out-of-stocks already..) more frequently have shorter end dates than the ones on the shelf. How the hell are we going to manage?
170 2018-11-07 22:25:59 My small stocks did go up. They have been going down until today. Trump is bad for economy
171 2018-11-07 22:25:12 Very very, enjoying whilst stocks last.
172 2018-11-07 22:25:06 Good luck on getting anymore money. Defense stocks already crashing.
173 2018-11-07 22:23:46 I think you mean stocks up on booze and weed

179 2018-11-07 22:20:04 Stop pretending you care, Flake. Time for you to ride off in the Arizona sunset and scam old people into buying some penny stocks like every other con artist from AZ.
180 2018-11-07 22:19:46 “Wicky” is another one for stocks that make annoying candle wicks.... no solid moves.  Can’t stand trying to catch an entry on one that is too wicky!  That’s a Bubble Head original!

185 2018-11-07 22:17:18 David - Obviously holding cash gives you optionality to buy US stocks after the crash... but, when, so to say, does it make sense to push some of those greenbacks into Int’l to get the currency kick too when $ falls???  Just curious regarding your thoughts. Thanks - Larry

190 2018-11-07 22:13:07 Do you just analyse the different pot stock charts one by one or do you research these pot stocks in depth fundamentally?
191 2018-11-07 22:12:20 @TeamCavuto I see health insurance stocks moved much higher today now we that we know the new Congress won’t be repealing Obamacare. Perhaps we can expect more triple digit increases in our premiums and bigger profits for insurance companies?
192 2018-11-07 22:11:44 Thank you for the explanation. But don't those go in a separate Ballot Box? I know a few years ago, for some reason, I was not on the roll and they put me in a pending verification box.
193 2018-11-07 22:11:30 3 stocks 8 minutes. No lame asa time outs / running away / campy / too patient play this time around please.

198 2018-11-07 22:07:32 With the cobalt disruption involving $KAT.T, prices have moved up, stocks have moved up, except $CBLT.V, watch list!

200 2018-11-07 22:06:48 I have substantial investments in stocks, bonds, etc, so the stock  market doing well impacts my wallet in a major way. My bigger concern is the long term implications of a trade war and large deficits that tax cuts may negatively impact. I hope I’m wrong.
201 2018-11-07 22:06:37 And so ends another day, stocks almost back to where they were before that ‘correction’ a few weeks back #interesting #investment

208 2018-11-07 22:02:30 Unless you were trading stocks before crypto
209 2018-11-07 22:01:05 Not analogous. Digital private keys cannot trustlessly control real world assets including stocks, gold, real estate, etc. Therefore this defeats the purpose (censorship resistance) of a slow expensive decentralized blockchain. Just use a streamlined database.
210 2018-11-07 22:00:24 Boring. Stocks historically rise after midterms, and any reduction of uncertainty from a major event passing without crazy outcomes sends market up.

212 2018-11-07 21:59:54 One of the most underrated skills is the ability to tune out distractions. FAANG stocks (and the new economy) are designed to distract you.
213 2018-11-07 21:58:21 Shorting daily chart breakdowns on stock indices is only good for short term trades or lossing money. For fundamental reasons. FA > TA. Yes, someday stocks will continue crashing alla 2008. Going after that one large winner is not worth it.

223 2018-11-07 21:55:42 Stocks surging on the heels of Midterm election results...the DOW closing up a whopping 545 points. Is it the Republican win in the Senate or the expectation of gridlock in the house that's driving this rally?
224 2018-11-07 21:54:27 Today was the third-best day for stocks since the 2016 election.
225 2018-11-07 21:54:15 Nice trade
226 2018-11-07 21:53:44 Due to this games speed compared to smash 4 I don’t think 2 stocks is a good idea but I’m fine with either 3 or 4.
227 2018-11-07 21:53:42 Indeed. Too me, "historically" I knew stocks would pop after midterms, just didn't know they would keep going hard in the paint today lol. Will be interesting to see how we end the week.
228 2018-11-07 21:53:17 Ten years have passed since we started trading.
 I was trading currency, but also started trading stocks.
229 2018-11-07 21:52:09 I'm not sure that's accurate, but we'll leave that there. From an investing perspective I just don't see federally legal weed anytime in the next 2 years. That's what these stocks need to justify their values. If you're investing over a 5-year horizon, have at it.

252 2018-11-07 21:41:42 Interesting that US stocks rose after democrats took the House. It’s like investors like Trump’s policies, but also like some control on his excesses.

256 2018-11-07 21:40:08 Under you:
Real wages are down

Inflation is up
And @gop #TaxScam has blown up the debt
257 2018-11-07 21:37:45 More breathing room is ideal. 3 stock also allows an SD without virtually being doomed to lose. So I don’t see the point here. With this logic, all smash games should be 2 stock. 

If you’re for 2 stocks, more power to you, but this argument doesn’t mean anything.

271 2018-11-07 21:31:28 all of that is wonderful; but there is still the not so stable, not so genius pulling strings which is equal to Choas; on the upside could be a good to  invest in stress med stocks

275 2018-11-07 21:30:45 And pot stocks soared.
276 2018-11-07 21:30:17 Consumer products - Specialty #197Industrygroups stocks had a nice move today.
277 2018-11-07 21:30:08 Nah a waste rather spend my money on dem stocks 
278 2018-11-07 21:29:13 I’ve never read a tweet from you that was pleased with a stock’s price action (and I hold a lot of the same stocks as you do).
279 2018-11-07 21:28:55 So democrats get control of the house and the stocks go up?  Is that what you're trying to say?
280 2018-11-07 21:28:43 No Jeff helped my pot stocks.
281 2018-11-07 21:28:40 Ok, I need in on weed stocks now that Sessions is out.
282 2018-11-07 21:28:40 These are all Canadian stocks, Chris
283 2018-11-07 21:28:28 MJ Stocks just made me almost spit out my drink laughing so hard....

" Court is not in...... Sessions!" 
284 2018-11-07 21:28:08 Why are my stocks so green lmfao
285 2018-11-07 21:27:57 All the pot stocks surged on news that Sessions is out $MJ $CGC $CRON
286 2018-11-07 21:27:56 Probably correlation not causation. Even if causation was probable, it wouldn’t change my investment philosophy and strategy. Continue to index all 401k/Roth $$$ and invest remaining in companies I think will continue succeed; FANG, China Stocks, MA/V, etc.
287 2018-11-07 21:27:41 RSI indicator & O'Neil's RS line (relative strength) on his proprietary charts are not the same, but it's a good question.  All indicators lag price! His RS he likes to see lead when buying growth stocks breaking out. The higher/the better!  But, price/volume is the key!  :)

289 2018-11-07 21:26:53 Not too many companies got left out of today's big rally. Just 51 of the S&P 500 stocks finished in the red. Biggest losers? $COTY and $KORS
290 2018-11-07 21:25:34 3 stocks 6 min
291 2018-11-07 21:25:15 Now see while I can see why you see it as that, I'm a person who didn't even like 2 stocks in 4 lol

293 2018-11-07 21:25:01 Seeing some stocks set up again. #stocks #investing
294 2018-11-07 21:24:51 S&P is at a tough spot on the chart, but there are some stocks breaking out of sound patterns.  I've dipped my toe in the water.
295 2018-11-07 21:24:48 It's too late Pam....those who didn't vote red or at all let all of us down and now we will pay. Hope you have pulled some of your $ out of the stocks cuz its gonna tumble.
296 2018-11-07 21:24:28 Election's over, and with it, naturally, the uncertainty about the results. US stocks? Up more than 2% today.
297 2018-11-07 21:24:01 All weed stocks are gonna rip hard today! Sentiment is electric with Jeff Sessions gone in the US. $IHL today is your day son!
298 2018-11-07 21:23:48 @Blizzard_Ent Fans are still upset, found a new Q&A thats made them even more upset and your stocks aren't rebounding. Might be time to say something to the community.
299 2018-11-07 21:23:41 Cakes & pottery & lying about stocks later.
300 2018-11-07 21:23:40 “Game company stocks drop due to reactive investors looking at a vocal minority’s response to a mobile game that will probably make millions up to billions in the global market”.
301 2018-11-07 21:23:39 Ur right it definitely aint no melee and wont be ever. But its definitely a bit faster than smash 4. Moves dead ass just make you explode in this game, and i think most competitive matches weve seen so far have been really good with 3 stocks, and ended in a timely fashion
302 2018-11-07 21:23:10 This is a good idea... just be careful on volatile stocks
303 2018-11-07 21:23:03 The in-game ledge grab limit helps a lot, among other things. The debate is 7 minutes vs 8 imo, not stocks
304 2018-11-07 21:22:55 @LamboJohnny One thing I make sure is not to even look at the stocks that are tweeted by that  (known as bigbird or something)

His “I bought another 100k” brings bad luck to any stock he touched in 2018.
305 2018-11-07 21:22:28 Yes. So buy as many stocks as you can as quickly as possible. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. 
306 2018-11-07 21:22:22 I wonder if  stocks have gone up since Q  
307 2018-11-07 21:22:01 These are the plays that will make you money. All U stocks will go up but some will go up more...just like last time.
308 2018-11-07 21:22:01 We missed the carnage in the market. So now we can approach it without excess baggage and big losses. That's a big plus! #stocks
309 2018-11-07 21:22:00 3 stocks is fine with 8 to 7 minutes
310 2018-11-07 21:21:36 I like the response of my pot stocks to no Jeff.
311 2018-11-07 21:21:17 call it a #Bluewave, call it a #ripple, call it a #DemBump, but my #stocks went up... not even 24hr

312 2018-11-07 21:21:09 Dude cannabis stocks are skyrocketing!
313 2018-11-07 21:20:53 SURE BET FOR STOCKS TO FALL IS ONLY AFTER I BUY
314 2018-11-07 21:20:47 It's the first time I've bought something from Apple. Surprisingly it's not iPhone, Mac nor Watch, but $aapl stocks.
315 2018-11-07 21:20:23 BUY ALL POT STOCKS with Jeff Sessions out expect the unexpected.
316 2018-11-07 21:20:10 Democrats said the same would happen if Trump was elected in 2016 and stocks moved exactly the opposite then too. Now that Dems control the house, it will likely lead to gridlock in Washington.  That bodes well for stocks.
317 2018-11-07 21:20:06 Definitely something we’ll have to see, even if we decide between 2/3 stocks, time is a whole other thing. We’ll figure it out come december
318 2018-11-07 21:19:44 Elections did some work on marijuana stocks

323 2018-11-07 21:18:01 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $XEC, $DVA, $PXD, $CNC, and $WCG.
324 2018-11-07 21:17:59 #MidtermElections2018 Trump fires Sessions, praises Pelosi, circles his wagons for Mueller report. But don't expect the Dems to seriously go after him: 2 yrs of just talk of impeach & tax records but no 'walk'. Stocks love it, now up 500 pts. Tax cuts now safe for next 6 yrs.
325 2018-11-07 21:17:47 Stocks rally after midterm elections went as investors expected; Dow Jones Industrial Average gains 500 points
326 2018-11-07 21:17:32 So we jumped on $FLRF when the weed stocks spiked. We caught the end tho and had to cut our losses quick per @timothysykes @SykesStudents. This time with real money but thank good we only lost $36. Great practice cutting losses quickly
327 2018-11-07 21:17:20 Stocks closing with lofty gains after election results splits Congress. Dow +550 points.
328 2018-11-07 21:17:17 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD, $GE, $BAC, $MSFT, and $F.
329 2018-11-07 21:16:28 I live in Illinois last night republicans lost big time here and I have just had all I can take of people who vote against what’s best for this country! Look at all the great things Trump has done with taxes, jobs, stocks, the economy, why would anyone vote that down! Just so sad
330 2018-11-07 21:16:13 Simply put, investing in a fraction of a bitcoin is a wise idea. 
Also, investing in tech stocks is a wise idea. 
Investing, in the right anything, is a wise idea. 
Don't just throw away your money, throw it away in good investments 
331 2018-11-07 21:16:06 For what reasons did you buy those stocks?
332 2018-11-07 21:15:54 this stocks is spicy
333 2018-11-07 21:15:45 Smash 4 had 2 stocks, and only got faster when people knew how to actually play. Smash 4 doesn’t look faster, you can’t look at end game 4 vs pre-release Ultimate.
334 2018-11-07 21:15:10 SIDENOTE:

From 2012-2017 I focused on #WEED Stocks much more than I should have for the most part...people know this.

From 2017-Unknown I have already spent much much more time focused on #Crypto...where this leads, who knows.
335 2018-11-07 21:14:42 Why do u think travel stocks are sky high? Thanks to stock values and 401K increases? Many taking extra trips worldwide? Thank you Pres Trump for your positive news re jobs and economy?
336 2018-11-07 21:14:06 I think sellers that were bag holding wanted out and they thought they found the right opportunity imho 

I feel sorry for them as we will get back to penny land! $PAOG $RBII
337 2018-11-07 21:14:04 World stocks ex Asia soar: US +2.1%; Europe +1.1%. Relief rally since election results were as expected & gridlock will limit surprises of all kinds. Market now back on track for a solid year & above bottom of my target range of 2780. S&P 500 could still rise another 100 points.

340 2018-11-07 21:13:49 MY BEST STOCKS JUST DROPPED 14% TODAY. A FUCKING NIGHTMARE.
341 2018-11-07 21:13:36 Republican presidents and a split Congress have been one of the best combinations for stocks, which have gained 15.7% on avg in this scenario based on the S&P 500 " S&P 500 has not produced a neg overall return in the 12mths
 following a midterm election since 1946.
342 2018-11-07 21:13:25 Jeff Sessions gone. Of course I just doubled down on my marijuana stocks! #LetsGetThisPaper
343 2018-11-07 21:13:18 Sessions is out so weed stocks are going to get a lot higher. Pun intended.
344 2018-11-07 21:13:05 Coming up on @FoxNews @TeamCavuto at 4:20ish super hot stocks after the election! As I noted at 4am today on FBN:am (the rare double 4s!) this split is good for stocks
345 2018-11-07 21:12:50 $ROKU down 10% on earnings report ouch...glad that I learned not to hold stocks on the day of report...Thank You @AOTtrades “Stewie”
346 2018-11-07 21:12:45 So if stocks sold due to panic selling in bonds, and bonds yields are still almost at highs ... Hmmm. Maybe bonds just suck and stocks are smarter ...
347 2018-11-07 21:12:45 Mid terms are over and now my stocks are going right back up. 23% PIP.
348 2018-11-07 21:12:20 Cannabis stocks are spiking following resignation of anti-pot U.S. attorney general
349 2018-11-07 21:12:13 S&P 500 (the market) has best post-midterm day since 1982.  Stocks typically do well when Congress is split and the White House is under Republican control.

Dow surges 544, +2.1% to 26,180, highest since Oct. 9.

S&P +2.1%, Nasdaq +2.4%, Russell 2000 +1.4%

Broad rally: Winners top losers 23/7 on NYSE, 22/9 Nasdaq
367 2018-11-07 21:08:03 Interest rates are still far away from their 40-year mean. It would be interesting to see how far the Fed can push rates up before a 15-20% correction in the stocks makes them quickly reverse course and open the floodgates for next round of QE.

372 2018-11-07 21:06:10 Farah, one of the issues I am running into with these sub penny stocks is that it is sometimes hard to get into a buy at your suggested price.  It just sits there and sits there longer than I am used to.  It happened to me twice today.  Suggestions?
373 2018-11-07 21:06:04 Weeds stocks jumped as soon as it was announced. .
374 2018-11-07 21:05:47  if dems won the senate you’d say “Stocks responding to great news!”

Ever think that stocks might be up BECAUSE of the politics?
375 2018-11-07 21:05:45 Clearly constitutional crisis are no biggies...but penny stocks going up ...stop the press.
376 2018-11-07 21:05:29 #Gold down (lots of selling in the US .. again), US$ down, stocks massively up. October is over. #Trump, #Pelosi and other socialists running DC make #WallStreet happy.

382 2018-11-07 21:03:50 How did Frito Lay stocks do?
383 2018-11-07 21:03:29 Some of these pot stocks are going to get scooped up by big name companies with major balance sheets, those are going to shoot to the moon.
384 2018-11-07 21:03:22 Characters with both great off stage pressure and off stage recovery, will be top tier. It may not play significantly faster than Smash 4, but acquiring stocks is fundamentally different, this game will be fast. We can raise the time, but I imagine most games won't make it to 5.
385 2018-11-07 21:03:20 You are basically trying to say the light through a key hole means things are fine when really it's a fire on the other side of the door. You've also failed to cover the reason GDP and stocks rose which was the ghost market stock buy backs. Lol we haven't cover the failed NAFTA.
386 2018-11-07 21:03:13 If you own stocks, you made money today because the Democrats took the House and will put a leash on the rabid possum in the White House.
(You better, Democrats! Don't be wusses!)
387 2018-11-07 21:03:13 Just watched weed stocks spike across the board and couldn't figure out why.  Hopped on Twitter and saw the news of Jeff Sessions resignation.  It's a good day! #WeedStocks #ByeJeff

390 2018-11-07 21:02:45 There was a time when people were excited that their favorite stocks would decline for a long time so that that they could accumulate them. Now we have machines that change their minds every day, buy when stocks go up & sell when they go down... Not sure that's a real improvement
391 2018-11-07 21:02:33 Sessions out. MJ stocks in?

396 2018-11-07 21:01:14 I don't think it's going to much of a problem once people figure out how to play. I imagine stocks are going to be easier to lose because of how air-dodging works. The meta will probably shift to getting people off stage and forcing them to dodge and die.
397 2018-11-07 21:01:04 Patience is a virtue. Not trading in bad market circumstances is a discipline. But I'm starting to like this market again. Long on $CRON. Bought 300 stocks @8.89 Plan is to hold overnight and sell in the low 10s. @timothysykes @profitly @completepenny @StocksToTrade

401 2018-11-07 21:00:35 we need help now, how long does @HMRCgovuk expect us to wait? Our defrauding competitors have a 22% edge on us. By 2021 they will have such vast stocks too, unless stock seized now

407 2018-11-07 20:57:44 Never liked impulse face ripping moves like this in equities.  Very counter-trendish feeling.

412 2018-11-07 20:56:50 Still semi-auto. Bump stocks are worthless gimmicks. But the are legal in most States. Besides the Las Vegas shooter used an M249 SAW.

419 2018-11-07 20:55:32 That’s true but you can’t stop there, you must add that it holds as many stocks with negative factor exposure as positive factor exposure, effectively canceling each other out.  The market weights add up to zero, as long and short S&P contracts would = 0
420 2018-11-07 20:55:32 Overall market was due uncertainty over midterms being over. Pot stocks from Sessions being forced to resign.  He's anti-pot.
421 2018-11-07 20:55:31 "You want the truth? You can't handle the Truth"....He'll never kiss yours or anyone else's ass, and it drives y'all literally insane. Stocks will go up in "straight jackets" over the next 6 yrs. Yes 6yrs!!! Deal with it witch.

423 2018-11-07 20:55:21 The tile will pull up, but you wont see the market data becuase we don’t support Stocks trading on OTC. However, if you currently own shares and want to sell, our support team can help 
424 2018-11-07 20:55:08 And pot stocks are smokin
425 2018-11-07 20:55:06 Pero es un tipo pensante. Hay que ser muy fanáticos para creer que el modelo peronista de liquidar stocks, puede durar más allá de un ciclo electoral
426 2018-11-07 20:54:52 So-so.
I recommend already earningscall ended,above important point, volume up stocks.
427 2018-11-07 20:54:45 Jeff Sessions out. Cannabis stocks on the rise.  Can't wait until I can buy edibles in every state I vacation to.
428 2018-11-07 20:54:42 For a long time we’ve seen break outs on declining/low volume. For individual stocks and major market embassies.

430 2018-11-07 20:54:30 I need to learn how to get into some stocks.
431 2018-11-07 20:54:27 What’s crazier? The fact he stepped down...or that there is a marijuana index of stocks! 
432 2018-11-07 20:54:12 2 stocks. 6 minutes for the first 2 months of Ultimate,  let aggressive strats be developed, and then introduce 3 stocks. 

Timeouts can freeze out viewership and the first few months of a game is very important.
433 2018-11-07 20:54:08 judging games this early is pointless, but 3 stocks will be fine. worse air dodges and nerfed magnet hands + 20% more damage? please.
434 2018-11-07 20:53:52 With the game being more offense heavy, it moves too quickly so I'd say 3 stocks. As for time, 7-8 minutes cause it's not moving that quickly lol.
435 2018-11-07 20:53:19 4 stocks FS meter legal. Patch that issue right up 
436 2018-11-07 20:53:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Stocks rally after midterm elections went as investors expected; Dow Jones Industrial Average gains 500 points

438 2018-11-07 20:52:34 Excuse me, you're  wrong on steel. President Trumps tariffs helped the US against European & Canadian steel company's.  Orange juice was hurt. A little. As far as company's coming back to USA, caterpillar & Ford. As well, stocks. Where did you get that info? Total BS

441 2018-11-07 20:52:18 Been there done that, maxed HELOC to buy pot stocks in 2016 then used the stocks as collateral to get even more margin funds lol
442 2018-11-07 20:52:16 I got CGRW and Hemp stocks.. yes or no?
443 2018-11-07 20:52:11 Stocks are up. Lol It's a good thing I didn't sell. I didnt think this election would be half as bad as the last but I was prepared both times. I sold right before the election in 2016 and bought back the day after amd got major gains. Not to brag but I'm a pretty good trader.
444 2018-11-07 20:52:11 I mean, we said that about Brawl and Smash 4 as well. I hope we're right this time. I'd prefer 3 stocks in Ultimate if it were as fast as 2 stocks in Smash 4.

447 2018-11-07 20:51:41 Stocks bottom on heavy volume, breakout higher on lower. As a general rule. That said, today they simply went hunting for late shorts.
448 2018-11-07 20:51:14 Invested in stocks, it’ll only take about 13 years assuming 7% returns.

The other side of the coin, if you make $1,000,000 a year and spend all of it, you’ll never retire. 

You need to attack the problem from both sides, increase income, reduce expenses (including taxes).
449 2018-11-07 20:51:13 Guess you don't have stocks. Try it. A lot of money to be made.
450 2018-11-07 20:50:32 Ha I'm your age and been long stocks since 90s. Added over time always long. '18 I was long emerg mkt calls and lost bigly. Otherwise long spy

451 2018-11-07 20:49:51 @mtowns24 those green stocks......
452 2018-11-07 20:49:42 i was thinking of starting 3 stocks 8 minutes at the stuff i run locally with what i've seen, it's easier to drop the stock count for being too slow than raise it for being fast too
453 2018-11-07 20:49:27 Not any to soon. Sa la vie. Not just for the MJ’s stocks. Gutless. And “resign ” hahaha ya right.
454 2018-11-07 20:49:13 I think we’re in for a good run up to Xmas but complacency could be costly, stick with quality stocks with strong balance sheet and PROVEN Mgmt with SKIN IN THE GAME! Absolutely essential on the AIM if you don’t want to get f**ked over!
455 2018-11-07 20:49:12 Jeff Sessions is out and almost immediately U.S pot stocks rise...coincidence, I think not. 
456 2018-11-07 20:49:00 #RealEstate is in #BearMarket territory. Housing #Stocks are in the gutter. Glut of inventory, #BuildingPermits & #Mortgage applications keep falling.

464 2018-11-07 20:46:33 Yeah the characters are moving faster but the games don't seem to actually be any faster. That's why I'm not sure it wouldn't stay 2 stocks.
465 2018-11-07 20:46:20 It was an off day for him...lol The man won MULTIPLE tourney's in a row and you finally janked him out a few stocks to win with some classic BSS. Lmfao!

468 2018-11-07 20:45:49 SESSIONS GONE POT STOCKS ABOUT TO TAKE OFF
469 2018-11-07 20:45:45 Oh I know everyone WANTS 3 stocks lol. It has never been an issue entirely of wants though. It has been an issue of the amount of time the game takes. Speed of stock loss seems the same or even slower than Smash 4 due to much less prominent rage and DI momentum cutting off faster
470 2018-11-07 20:45:27 Marijuana stocks are soaring

495 2018-11-07 20:40:03 Does Robinhood still not allow its customers to buy OTC stocks? If so, it's going to be hard for some of these $MDXG bagholders to add to their positions tomorrow
496 2018-11-07 20:39:55 Dems win = weed stocks on the way up.
497 2018-11-07 20:39:45 Ya think?  Just a week after people dumped stocks just to get out at any price?
498 2018-11-07 20:39:35 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
499 2018-11-07 20:39:34 3 stock 8 mins ultimate needs to be fun not a short match to save time. If people want to reduce it to 2 stocks to reduce time that is acceptable but keep it 3 stocks 8mins at best.
500 2018-11-07 20:39:33 What was it that made you feel that weed stocks had the chance to make this move?
501 2018-11-07 20:39:21 3 Stocks and 7 Minutes sounds perfect, only go 8 if needed

Theres only one decent place to buy blood runes from (yanille, 450~ e buying whole stock) and stocks refill very slowly.

527 2018-11-07 20:34:32 Jeff Sessions out is a huge boost to the #marijuana industry, even more so than the three states that legalized medical/recreational use yesterday. #Pot stocks had given up early gains from the election results but are now rallying mightily. $CGC $TLRY $CRON $APHA $ACB

563 2018-11-07 20:29:58 With Jeff Sessions Resigning we are watching these Pot Stocks very closely $MLHC $KOSK $ETII $HIPH $ARCS $MCOA $MJNA $MGON
564 2018-11-07 20:29:38 Appears to be a surge across MJ stocks on the Session resignation announcement.
565 2018-11-07 20:29:13 Stocks are rising. Why do you lie
566 2018-11-07 20:29:02 $GWPH 15:06 Cannabis stocks rise after Jeff Sessions resigns as Attorney General  Several marijuana stocks are on the rise after Attorney General Jeff Sessions submitted his resignation at the request of President Donald Trump. Sessions has been vehemently against legalizing
567 2018-11-07 20:28:51 not yet. but my guess is not amiable to pot stocks
568 2018-11-07 20:28:47 Absolutely. Or the stocks.
569 2018-11-07 20:28:22 The Dow = +500

570 2018-11-07 20:28:11 Blaze it cannabis stocks
571 2018-11-07 20:28:08 I would even say 2 stocks should be considered... just throwing it out there
572 2018-11-07 20:27:52 Shares of prisons dipped while Cannabis stocks are rallying!
573 2018-11-07 20:27:43 7... not too short because then people will go for time-outs more. 8 might be too long. 7 could be a nice balance for 3 stocks in a game with limited defensive options
574 2018-11-07 20:27:23 and write about it.  Oh, and train yourself.  If you have TOS, pick a random day and replay it.  Start at 11:30 and look at hourly setups on your favorite stocks.  See if there is a setup.  Then skip to 1:30 and 2:30.  I used to run a stock 5 times to get familiar with it.
575 2018-11-07 20:27:19 What gets me is... If Marijuana became legal at the U.S. Government level... Wouldn't that hurt Canada Pot stocks when U.S. companies take over?
576 2018-11-07 20:27:01 Pot stocks are "smoking" after the Sessions resignation
577 2018-11-07 20:26:59 U can borrow againzt the house to buy more or if u r lucky, housing in uk will appreciate and u make capital gains. Theres also paper assrts like stocks gold silver bitcoin etc. This stuck u only make capital gains
578 2018-11-07 20:26:49 Reefer stocks seem to enjoy the announcement.
579 2018-11-07 20:26:43 People were often getting timed out in Ultimate with 3 stocks 5 minutes. People often had 2 stocks left too.

Be careful when voting for the time amount in Smash Ultimate. I think it would be safe to say 8 minutes, 7 minutes at worse. Not trying to have Brawl level timeouts again
580 2018-11-07 20:26:22 It’s sold at my area. Surulere. There’s a lady that stocks them up at her shop
581 2018-11-07 20:25:52 That is the only thing recently, I used to use it for like tracking stocks though
582 2018-11-07 20:25:34 Looking like this year's November-December epic finale theme will be #Weed stocks.  Who's ready to bank a Six Figure+ month with me!?!

585 2018-11-07 20:24:42 Oh wait, people probably don't know that in Brawl matches went to time extremely often with planking and such. Honestly I think 3 stocks 8 minutes is best, but I can be okay with 7.
586 2018-11-07 20:24:39 so are weed stocks up today
587 2018-11-07 20:24:29 Pot stocks were already having a good day with Michigan voting for rec legalization, and then boom....#Sessions resigns as AG and those stocks are skyrocketing...Tilray +29%, Aurora +8% and Canopy +6%.
588 2018-11-07 20:24:14 Been watching how the voters react to legal cannabis legalization and I’m completely convinced that it’s time. To look at cannabis stocks as the next Amazon. It’s just betting on the right companies right now is not that easy.
589 2018-11-07 20:23:55 Cloud stocks on cloud 9.
590 2018-11-07 20:23:40 What gets me is... If Marijuana became legal at the U.S. Government level... Wouldn't that hurt Canada Pot stocks when U.S. companies take over?
591 2018-11-07 20:23:37 Now that #Sessions  has his nose out of joint, the pot stocks are flying. #CNBC
592 2018-11-07 20:23:16 If you bought Twilio or any of the pot stocks I suggested in my premarket tweet this morning, you’re a very happy person about now. $TWLO $TLRY $CRON.
593 2018-11-07 20:22:36 Meds stocks jump up as the Democrats will give them high profits and sales in healthcare revisions! Med companies will reward them fully! Such a corrupt and abusive system to the people
594 2018-11-07 20:22:26 Did you manage to find stocks with tight price action in the last few days? and if so, many of them in your watch list?

Most of the stocks I was watching started turning last week so the patterns they've formed are quite 'Straight Up From Button'...
595 2018-11-07 20:22:15 Stocks going back up!!!

601 2018-11-07 20:21:26 Jeff Sessions is out, so my guess is that weed stocks will rally now.
602 2018-11-07 20:21:13 Ya might as well just long ALL pot stocks overnight. JIC.
$TLRY $NBEV $LEVB etc.

605 2018-11-07 20:20:58 How many of you invest in stocks rather than personally investing in one of America's soon-to-be adults. The ones that aren't yours dummy. And I'm not talking about money

607 2018-11-07 20:20:39 Trump a few days ago - “stocks are going to crash if we let Dems win”.  How’s that workin out for ya?
608 2018-11-07 20:20:09 The least you can do for your pockets is buy weed stocks.
609 2018-11-07 20:20:03 Weed stocks going on a Jeff Sessions rally. $TLRY up 30%.
610 2018-11-07 20:19:54 Last week stocks were all red. Today, democrats win the house and stocks are up across the board. Another clear example of the stock market leading. Sell the rumours buy the fact. #stocks
611 2018-11-07 20:19:46 US markets are out of control and has never made less sense than right now. Global growth evaporating, rates rising, QE ending, investors overseas bailing, defaults lining up, yields ramping, curve flattening, q4 guidedowns everywhere + buy US stocks.
612 2018-11-07 20:19:19 I tell u easy accounting formula. Debit = In, Credit = Out. Sales & Income = Credit , Purchases & Expenses = Debit. Sales & Purchases (Anything about stocks), Income & Expenses (Other than stocks). Ok later I share more. I share this with my students for them to easy understand.

617 2018-11-07 20:18:33 Stocks jumped 2 years ago after Trump was elected. Stocks jump again today after midterm elections show future gridlock for the legislature. 

The fear of legislation keeps some investment money on the sidelines. In business, gridlock means stability and predictability.
618 2018-11-07 20:18:28 All the stocks just shot up
619 2018-11-07 20:18:17 I saw that! They’re saying it’s because since Sessions resigned the Cannabis stocks are shooting up. Of course it was a 450 before he resigned.

632 2018-11-07 20:15:48 Cannabis stocks are climbing now that Jeff Sessions has resigned. Trump has always believed marijuana should be left to the states. We may see it happen now.

661 2018-11-07 20:10:04 Trump gave a tax break to corporations. (Saying that it will boost our economy) which it did because instead of paying employees more like trump said they would they instead decided to start a stock buy back which lessen the amount of stocks in the economy boosting stock prices..
662 2018-11-07 20:09:57 Cannabis stocks here we come!
663 2018-11-07 20:09:53 I suggest to watch stocks on your watchlist every day. Sort out weak stocks and add strong ones. So you get a good feeling for the market.
664 2018-11-07 20:09:47 President Trump & family create jobs x 99%, from manufacturing to hotel business, and they are different from Obama&family & Clinton&family they’re making money from speeches, books, & stocks that are seldom benefited to 99%. D. Feinstein suspiciously becomes billionaire.

681 2018-11-07 20:05:23 Pot Stocks rocking with Sessions gone!
682 2018-11-07 20:05:08 You are on the right track.  Options can be VERY risky.  Have to start small and get consistent.  We all want to have those big wins and it compels us to trade when we shouldn’t.  Not all stocks have good options.  If you can do 50-100 shares of common on some...

686 2018-11-07 20:04:16 Investors may shift from the fear of losing money and the fear of missing out if they reduced exposure after the stock market falls and then miss out as stocks trends back up. 

An active risk management system for drawdown control may help avoid emotional decisions.

692 2018-11-07 20:02:03 @realDonaldTrump Hi. Really watch what you say, stocks are volatile. Spread the word. I need everyone working together now to quickly renew investor confidence. We need everyone expressing these sentiments publicly to fix things fast. Democrats should know not to try anything now

714 2018-11-07 19:58:43 Bottom line: The stock market tells you all you need to know about Washington DC ... who is in whose pockets and just which elites benefit most from which party is in charge! But most of all, stocks are telling you it just doesn't really matter who is in charge of government!
715 2018-11-07 19:58:35 Jeff Sessions gone ? My Marijuana stocks gonna moon bruh.
716 2018-11-07 19:58:33 Loving these weed stocks! $CGC $ACB $CRON #WednesdayWisdom

718 2018-11-07 19:57:53 It cracks me up, these guys are buying Cannabis stocks. On the back of Sessions resignation.  Most of them are Canadian companies. $APHA
719 2018-11-07 19:57:48 Dam I should have doubled up on my stocks last week when I took that hit. The market is on its way to correcting itself 
720 2018-11-07 19:57:03 Anyone out there interested in getting into investing in stocks, but are unsure of how to do it or which company's you should invest in? Google The Dividend Aristocrats! They're company's who have paid a dividend that HAS INCREASED EVERY YEAR FOR AT LEAST THE PAST 25 YEARS. FYI
721 2018-11-07 19:56:59 Overnight ideas: All weed stocks! $NBEV 4.55 $CRON 9.30 $PYX 24.6 $TLRY 130
722 2018-11-07 19:56:52 On a positive, weed stocks spiked up within 90 seconds of the announcement.
723 2018-11-07 19:56:48 If you Already have some of these stocks is it redundant to buy an ETF?
724 2018-11-07 19:56:46 Quick, everyone buy pot stocks!!!
725 2018-11-07 19:56:46 Need guidance looking for stocks that focus on tech/manufacture foldable phones . Investors help me out
726 2018-11-07 19:56:46 Y’all better hop on them marijuana stocks before it’s too late 
727 2018-11-07 19:56:31 Second rotation, probably locked in. 

Will be a neuroscience lab, studying synapses and neurotransmitters in relation to Parkinson's.

Will be pretty heavily involved in setting up of the lab and getting stocks ready, with actual projects rising early next year.
728 2018-11-07 19:56:14 Demonrats are the perpatraters they love that there stocks are making money. We still have the Senate thank God more good in the country then bad.
729 2018-11-07 19:56:05 .Not really. I am investing in popcorn stocks. The real reality show in the House is about to be lit!
730 2018-11-07 19:56:03 My pot stocks better go up after that goofball #JeffSessions resigned
731 2018-11-07 19:56:00 I wasnt even talking about pot stocks, lol, but yes, it will be a long play.
732 2018-11-07 19:55:56 @JohnJHarwood is a Democrat shill that will say anything. There is no constitutional crisis because there was no collusion. At least not by Trump. The Democrats colluded. That's why stocks are still ripping. @MelissaLeeCNBC
733 2018-11-07 19:55:43 defense stocks were* up a lot also now less so but still up since Cheeto took office
734 2018-11-07 19:55:40 #PowerHour baby.  There are so many cheap MJ stocks I literally have been having a bit of a hard time picking some new buys.  I seen a guy spamming VRT today all over the place Ive been eying them same with MMJ, CANN, NSP, XTHC ect... So much opportunity
735 2018-11-07 19:55:37 Our senior survival class was ass  and economics didn’t go in depth with stocks or any of the many other ways of making money
736 2018-11-07 19:55:26 @TradersCom sessions (super anti pot) resigns, democrats control house.  Worth keeping eye on marijuana stocks seriously from here on, very high possibility we get some push for full legalization between now and 2020
737 2018-11-07 19:55:07 I agree got in at the same range as well. News just broke that Jeff Sessions is out now. Replaced by a libertarian, MJ Stocks might get a nice rise. Other then that I'm trying to take cover, baby needs new shoes.
738 2018-11-07 19:55:07 That is the immediate reaction. Pot stocks popped on the headlines but its going to be a very long process
739 2018-11-07 19:54:53 Yeah. The man who not only has lowered our debt, but lowered our taxes, lowered the unemployment rate and increased stocks. Man this is so terrible.
740 2018-11-07 19:54:30 #Weed stocks just got more attractive in the U.S.
741 2018-11-07 19:54:23 Jeff Sessions resigned, good for pot stocks?
742 2018-11-07 19:54:18 Yesterday stocks were INSANE; I got to push all my (formerly your) cash into semiconductor index funds that tanked in value and got like a 5% return in a few hours. That's right; me lazily tapping buttons on my phone made more money than you working your shitty job.
743 2018-11-07 19:54:18 @jeffsessions resigns finally, buy weed stocks! Huge win for the @MarijuanaPolicy industry!
744 2018-11-07 19:53:53 I think stocks go up 2000 points in one day if Trump is removed from office and the US government collapses. 

No regulation!
745 2018-11-07 19:53:50 Not believe in this 1
746 2018-11-07 19:53:31 The local AUS200 index is tipped to open higher today, following a .surge in U.S. stocks overnight. Investors piled into growth sectors such as technology and healthcare on relief that the outcome of the U.S. midterm elections was as expected.
747 2018-11-07 19:53:21 Chinese stocks as well??
748 2018-11-07 19:53:16 Fell good getting bank into the #stocks #blnk even tho it’s only like $10 but it’s a start 
749 2018-11-07 19:53:15 Resignation of Jeff Sessions has limited effect on overall stock market...gains still holding near high of day...marijuana related stocks could be on the move on these headlines...
750 2018-11-07 19:53:00 *buys all weed stocks available*
751 2018-11-07 19:52:58 Think about how shitty of a human being you have to be for prison stocks to drop when you resign............. #sessions
752 2018-11-07 19:52:50 Jeff Sessions resignation was widely expected. Interesting to see pot stocks reaction here:
$TLRY,$CRON, $NBEV, $CGC etc
753 2018-11-07 19:52:22 Honestly it depends on how fast the game ends up playing. Bc in melee stocks could end super quick so the 4 stocks was reasonable, in smash Wii U stocks took much longer so it made sense to have less stocks. Have to see when the game comes out
754 2018-11-07 19:51:40 #PotStock Jeff Sessions resigned, good for pot stocks
755 2018-11-07 19:51:40 $DTEA getting empathy play as pot stocks rally. Expect a very similar behavior to $TLRY
756 2018-11-07 19:51:34 More money, more jobs, less regulation creating more jobs, stocks while dipping are coming back and still at historic highs, just to name a few.
757 2018-11-07 19:51:34 Pot stocks doing their yoyo today in and out of green.....now green with power hr left in trading day.
758 2018-11-07 19:51:00 I just reply: “you can buy gold. It will most likely increase in value faster than your money in the bank. Therefore makes you richer. Or real-estate. Or stocks. Or countless other things. Now be quiet” they usually block me after 
759 2018-11-07 19:50:53 Adios Sessions...ya old fart! giddy up pot stocks! $CGC $MJ $ACB $CRON $TLRY
760 2018-11-07 19:50:34 Hahaha Sessions resigns.... Good for pot stocks.  $TLRY $CGC
761 2018-11-07 19:50:33 Hello, Pot Stocks!
=^.^=
762 2018-11-07 19:50:30 Diego is an amphisbaena who trades stocks on the weekends.
763 2018-11-07 19:50:07 Think about that for a minute, private prison stocks moving lower and cannibis tickers moving higher now that Sessions has resigned.
764 2018-11-07 19:50:02 No. Retest or not doesn't factor into the model. If it does turn negative, it will be because stocks ran too far without the internal foundation strong and keeping up.
765 2018-11-07 19:50:02 J’ai vendu mes actions $etsy aujourd’hui. Je suis un peu triste. 

I sold my $etsy stocks today. Kinda sad.
766 2018-11-07 19:50:01 Sessions out has to be massively bullish weed stocks $MJ.
767 2018-11-07 19:49:47 Marijuana stocks getting a pop off the Sessions news
768 2018-11-07 19:49:31 Should pot stocks be going up with Sessions stepping down?
769 2018-11-07 19:49:30 Good bye Jeff Seassions Hello #Weed Stocks!
770 2018-11-07 19:49:09 Prison stocks are moving lower too with Sessions leaving. $GEO $CXW
771 2018-11-07 19:48:47 Cannabis stocks are about to POP
772 2018-11-07 19:48:35 Having money invested in stocks might be enough to make you qualify, which of course muddles the whole thing because even very poor people can put money into a retirement account
773 2018-11-07 19:48:34 Dude I saw this and it’s so fucked up I’m surprised you aren’t a little more mad at this after all they did just packed up and ran with all your supposed stocks they promised
774 2018-11-07 19:48:33 Wow, Sessions resigned...here we go marijuana stocks! #Aurora
775 2018-11-07 19:48:30 Hi Kellijean, thanks for getting in touch. The demand for the Hue outdoor products have exceeded expectations, we are hoping to have stocks replenished soon. We do not have a specific date for this, however keep an eye on our social media channels and website for updates.
776 2018-11-07 19:47:58 The pot stocks are all moving higher again now that Sessions is out. Notable blips up for $CGC $CRON $TLRY $ACB $APHA in past few minutes.
777 2018-11-07 19:47:52 @popeofvillage gotta be bullish for $MJ stocks...
778 2018-11-07 19:46:01 Stocks Are Rising Because a Gridlocked Congress Can't Do Anything Crazy
779 2018-11-07 19:45:48 Sessions resigned, go long pot stocks, lol.
780 2018-11-07 19:45:46 Never hold on to something for too long..... unless it's stocks, keep them and invest!
781 2018-11-07 19:45:46 *JEFF SESSIONS HAS RESIGNED AS ATTORNEY GENERAL

stocks dip a bit, same with Treasury yields and the dollar
782 2018-11-07 19:45:27 ..It's (accounting) the language of business and it's an imperfect language, but unless you are willing to put in the effort to learn accounting - how to read and interpret financial statements - you really shouldn't select stocks yourself"

783 2018-11-07 19:45:10 Watch those weed stocks, people, with Sessions out.
784 2018-11-07 19:45:05 My cannabis stocks are crushing. They must’ve heard about The Great Congressional Awakening, too. 
785 2018-11-07 19:45:00 US stocks traded higher on Wednesday after the results of the country's midterm elections came out as expected.
786 2018-11-07 19:44:41 I predict stocks will see a surge following Democratic victories,
Not the opposite, as our bully-in-chief has suggested.

793 2018-11-07 19:39:40 Most stock market guys get married to stocks and don't sell even when the stocks don't perform.
794 2018-11-07 19:37:54 There is a (tiny) kernel of truth in what you’re saying, but there are lots of stocks with convertible bonds and stock loans, and they have nowhere near this % shorted. The short position against Tesla has very little to do with bonds or loans.
795 2018-11-07 19:36:48 Cool. I haven't seen the current issue. My local WH Smiths only stocks a couple of copies which sell immediately. There are about 500 game developers working in the area so that may explain why! What is your interview about?
796 2018-11-07 19:36:21 @NancyPelosi your talking about oversight. Maybe we need to have oversight on your finances and how you made all that money when you sold the stocks days before it fell. Oversight my ass
797 2018-11-07 19:36:13 i dont really trade equities besides some personal account long oligopoly stocks (cough CME group)

but  this is entertaining... since i have an RV/ semi RV business at home
798 2018-11-07 19:35:30 Nice. How are your weed stocks doing?
799 2018-11-07 19:35:01 Trading convergence in stocks vs oil seems risky. Not saying they’re not periodically correlated, but they can also diverge significantly. Imagine if lower oil reflects lesser geopolitical risks, weighs on breakevens and bond yields. Sounds pretty bullish equities yes?
800 2018-11-07 19:34:54 $DTEA getting some volume, still #long! cheap compared to similar stocks in this segment
801 2018-11-07 19:34:33 If Worst comes worst. Like if I literally don’t have a dollar to my name. I’ll just sell my stocks. Benefits of being a shareholder

806 2018-11-07 19:33:36 Tbh I would travel through time to all of the best eras of music, but at the same time also invest in stocks
807 2018-11-07 19:32:50 Who....wants 4 stocks..... That's insane
808 2018-11-07 19:32:28 Agreed. Calling mkt tops has been a fools game. I haven't shorted stocks for long time til this yr. Whether highs are in remains to be seen but what is diff this time is CBs in aggregate are withdrawing liquidity while global int rates rise & debt levels have never been higher
809 2018-11-07 19:32:01 You cling to a reality based in delusion.  Delusion Trump didn’t risk his money in business to create even more.  And then going further into delusion land by stating he wasn’t smart by not putting it into stocks.   It’s beyond comprehension how delusional of reality you are.

821 2018-11-07 19:29:47 Saw this today: 

Since 1946 there have been 18 midterm elections. The stock market has rallied over the next 12 months after every single midterm election. Fully 100% of the time, stocks have been higher 12 months after a midterm election by an average of 17%.

826 2018-11-07 19:27:37 Companies kill for 10% margin YOY for 50 years.  That’s great management. Trump did this in real estate.  Fact.

The major averages hit their session highs after President Donald Trump indicated he is willing to work with Democrats on policy initiatives that would help the economy keep growing.
829 2018-11-07 19:26:47 Smash 4 should have had 3 stocks and most people agreed there too but to's didn't care about that. Hopefully this time even more people agree so they can't ignore us.
830 2018-11-07 19:26:36 I got some stocks a few months ago and I feel like such a fucking capitalist pig 
831 2018-11-07 19:26:22 Off course it works  Stocks mkt are hundred years old.
Low cap shitcoins (and illiquid penny stocks) are the ones more difficult as random pumps&dumps can come out of nowhere
832 2018-11-07 19:25:24 Then I would commend them however, that is not the story for every child. These people are individuals. Treat them like you’d wanted to be treated in their situation.
833 2018-11-07 19:25:17 There is a lot of noise out there regarding stocks these days. 
834 2018-11-07 19:24:59 "Stocks rally after Trump signals bipartisan effort on economy" How far will they fall when they realize it's another empty promise @CNBC  Oh yeah that's right, you'll quote him saying its the fault of the Democratic party. Remember when you used to look at things long term?
835 2018-11-07 19:24:07 “Since 1946, there have been 18 midterm elections. Stocks were higher 12 months after every single one. Every single one. That’s 18 for 18. Even though we’ve had every possible political combination in the past 72 years.

837 2018-11-07 19:23:25 In those cases we would not object, unfortunately that is not the full story. There are hundreds of children who were literally torn from their family.  Btw, there’s been an increase in republican own adoption centers making money off of the situation.
838 2018-11-07 19:22:58 Interesting, healthcare stocks are booming today on the news that Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats will once again be lining the those companies bank accounts with money stolen from tax payers.

855 2018-11-07 19:16:39 It’s the president who claims all Democrats want open border - that is a lie!  He also claims we want bad people here - that is a lie. From its birth, this country valued immigrants and stood for helping people in need.

857 2018-11-07 19:14:46 That's what the news headline says, but experienced traders knows that's not true. MJ stocks are moving a small amount at best. The initial run is over and was days before the news. That's the way it works. Get in 2 months before you know it's coming and then get out before.

862 2018-11-07 19:12:58 Wall Street stocks jump after Democrats win control of House of Reps in midterm elections. Dow up around 1.5%. Investors buying tech and healthcare stocks on bets that tighter regulation might be harder to push through - but wary about more political gridlock @abcnews #auspol
863 2018-11-07 19:12:47 There is no comparison between the way Obama and Trump have separated children at the border!  There may be some people entering who will be vetted and not allowed to enter. There will be people who have lived atrocious lives and are seeking refuge.
864 2018-11-07 19:12:17 I don’t think it “owns the factors.” It owns all stocks in market cap weighted proportions, but the weights result in negative & positive factor exposures canceling themselves out resulting in zero exposure. So it’s just “neutral.” It’s pressing the gas & brake simultaneously

868 2018-11-07 19:10:25 Stocks are all up today because there is just enough gridlock in Washington.. haha what a crazy democracy we live in. Right in between the fine line of enough votes for tax cuts for buinsessnes but not enough votes to for  aggressive trade tariffs.
869 2018-11-07 19:08:41 Last year’s tax break for the exceedingly wealthy has not seen those monies reinvested in jobs or the economy. Instead companies have chosen to buy back stocks, further enriching themselves. These are facts! Something I find time & time again, Trump supporters can’t accept.
870 2018-11-07 19:08:39 College is overrated.  The cost effectiveness is  absurd. Batter to invest the tuition in a dividend stocks.

872 2018-11-07 19:07:21 Keep in mind that the top 50 of the SP500 make up over 50% of the index’s weighting.  That leaves 450 stocks that can have a very wide disparity.
873 2018-11-07 19:06:26 Yes i forgot how disastrously wrong he was on tesla. 

He makes money shoveling chicken shit and selling eggs. 

His firm went tits up years ago, pretty clear why considering his track record. 

He was basically the only person who lost money shorting stocks in 2008 lol.

878 2018-11-07 19:03:10 I have little faith in these stocks because I don't believe governments can maintain the control of supply that's necessary for retail prices to stay -- wait for it -- high. This is a product with limited demand and an almost unlimited, easily-created potential supply.

893 2018-11-07 18:57:19 As I have said before, many people way smarter than me have  (since Q4 2009) been trying to call a market top based on principles of sound money. To do that will be to ignore one fact: after 2009,  stocks = ECONOMY. It ain't over till it is

939 2018-11-07 18:34:05 Congrats, nice read. The dip in the market did hurt us as well even though it is expected. I guess as they say stocks are on sale but still is not a great feeling when the net worth goes down...
940 2018-11-07 18:34:00 There is an inbuilt screener which gives all time high stocks. Then u can put mcap filter.
941 2018-11-07 18:33:54 I don't know either. Bottom picking is hard, so is picking highest price to sell. I buy and sell in layer. Stocks gotta hold longer to see full maturity. Bot Adobe at 186 and dumped all of them at 260. Held for 10 months.

946 2018-11-07 18:30:32 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim

954 2018-11-07 18:28:15 Everything I study, the cornerstones of wealth all point to:
#RealEstate (ownership of land)
#Investments (ownership of stocks & crypto)
#Entrepreneurship (ownership of business)
955 2018-11-07 18:27:58 This string is a textbook example of why #CRISPR companies have such inflated valuations.  The investors in these stocks have literally no idea what they own or what the various technologies can do.  Complete hype-cycle mindless lemmings.
956 2018-11-07 18:27:52 Stocks broadly higher on Congressional split decision, perhaps on maxim that gridlock is generally good for stocks. Although that rationale presumes a busier federal legislature doing by and large detrimental things for financial markets. 1/2

971 2018-11-07 18:19:42 So called Financial Analysts from New York   should be investigated and their incomes should be audited  whether they were paid by big Hedge funds to bring certain stocks down or not. People should demand Congressional investigation. This might be biggest public scam.

974 2018-11-07 18:19:33 1) they can’t run the ledger — it has to be a 3rd party because brokers don’t trust each other with sub ledgers— check out the video - it explains it - it’s complex and counterintuitive 
2) huge problem — it’s why stocks settle so slowly (days) and are siloed by market / country

978 2018-11-07 18:17:15 All so called Financial Analysts ( paid agents of hedge Funds ?) should be investigated whether they were paid by big Hedge funds to bring certain stocks down or not.
979 2018-11-07 18:16:13 Partly. That sounds like a trite answer but contract pricing is usually linked to spot price. So I will look for a combination of high spot U prices and high term prices. So I will look at both to decide which stocks to sell and which to keep for the longer term.
980 2018-11-07 18:16:06 GREAT profits as $SPY and $QQQ is regaining momentum. HOWEVER, do NOT chase stocks. Markets highly overextended bull so it’s very possible to pullback before another run. Don’t forget to lock in gains and use profits to roll up. Do NOT screw up your principal at these levels

987 2018-11-07 18:11:18 If you own any stocks that have been severely lagging during this nice snapback it probably is a good tell that you should cut bait with them. I'm seeing many garbo stocks bouncing hard right now $QQQ $SPY
988 2018-11-07 18:11:05 Funny how you only link your sources that support you, but when you use a source that reports actual facts you don't put that @ in front. That's a tell your misstating details from it like all your the stock market is up tweets when you only showed the dow jones stocks. Pathetic!
989 2018-11-07 18:10:49 Bitcoin is digital gold, few more are great forms of payment proxys and altcoins are newtech businesses that jump on the train of the digital assets, they can be traded or exchanged as digital stocks that represent great enterprises in the blockchain ecosystem.

996 2018-11-07 18:05:39 Naz appears on track for volume to be greater than Tues, which would make this an O'Neil follow-through day. Regardless, v aggressive position traders should be buying one or more emerging leaders today #stocks

998 2018-11-07 18:04:45 Because I'm not frightened of a strong black woman. Nor do I think private citizens should own AR-15s or anything equivalent I also believe that bump stocks oughta be outlawed, same as RPG's.

Yes we have reduced frequency of calls of late and that helped a lot. 
Stocks will come when we see good opportunities.
1003 2018-11-07 18:02:40 Anecdotally, a bunch of my college friends are texting me asking if I’m buying up here because we’re “out of the woods” from elections. Specifically they are asking about weed stocks. FWIW
1004 2018-11-07 18:02:31 Definitely on the wrong side of a few calls today. No p/l damage, but I had figured a much more muted reaction to  midterms + Fed minutes pending. #Stocks

1019 2018-11-07 17:55:23 Last time I checked diesel stocks globally were higher yoy (end Oct), this may change these weeks though. 
Additional gasoline/diesel added to the market by a refinery returning from maintenance depends on the refinery. India produces 2.3 mbd diesel but only 0.9 mbd gasoline.
1020 2018-11-07 17:55:05 Forgot the sheer volume of ridiculous & outright fraudulent Chinese companies listed on US exchanges.

1021 2018-11-07 17:54:02 Actually in 1946 stocks have risen 17% on average after a midterm. So, I will give you the point that it has nothing to do with Democrats winning the house. However, it also doesn't have anything to do with trump either. It has more to do with it being the midterm.
1022 2018-11-07 17:53:41 Continue to load more $LMFA. No day trades on the Canadian market today. Stocks have ran too much for my liking versus their news (namely $ID.V and $DM.V)

1032 2018-11-07 17:48:34 Obama already took credit by saying by his last presidency economy was stable and flowing high before Trump. Meanwhile, first day of Trump presidency stocks had gone up remarkably.
1033 2018-11-07 17:48:30 #Stocks,#Indexes Note, however, with the significant SPX bottom ca. 2650 recently, the local, as opposed to the main, trend remains up.  And we remain long SPX and NDX, as noted 11.04.

1036 2018-11-07 17:46:17 i understand. But diesel stocks are low worldwide. India will help. But as refineries comeback from maintenance  they will also inevitablky produce gasoline which is added into a market that already looks horrible.
1037 2018-11-07 17:46:07 Only bad part is most of the 7,000 assets already created look like people spamming the chain and don't represent actual assets. Would be nice to see actual assets created on the chain like stocks, bonds etc.

1042 2018-11-07 17:43:46 My previous comment on this amazing, amazing product:

'When I tried Naturli, I went to the fridge and threw out a half used Flora tub. I now cycle 45 minutes to the nearest @sainsburys which stocks it and buy five tubs then walk out.

It is the golden one.'
1043 2018-11-07 17:43:28 The best way to reduce the risk of rising interest rates? Avoid long-term bonds and hold a diversified portfolio of stocks and short-term fixed income.

Annualized returns since 9/2016:
20-YR Corporate Bond Index = -1.4%
DFA 60/40 Balanced Index = +8.3%
1044 2018-11-07 17:42:51 "I support strong background checks and closing the Charleston loophole. Bump stocks should be banned and assault weapons should be reserved for our military - not for private citizens." Unacceptable to the NRA, no doubt...this is crazier than the dead pimp win in Nevada.
1045 2018-11-07 17:42:29 One hurdle is down. The election came out as predicted with a split congress. That relief of uncertainty has the markets, both stocks and bonds, moving better today. Now we just have to clear this afternoon’s hurdle of the Fed meeting announcement at 2pm.

1064 2018-11-07 17:34:49 With all due respect, China and trade, while crucial to traders and investors, takes a back seat to larger "perceived"  issues like Immigration, Employment, Meuller etc. Still roughly only 50% of Americans invested in stocks.

1068 2018-11-07 17:32:28 Yep.  Very much so.

Mostly Short squeeze on the Tech high valuation stocks..,..
1069 2018-11-07 17:30:39 Min vol strategies load up on stocks with much stabler cash flows. Think utilities, consumer staples. These have greater exposure to interest rate changes.

1071 2018-11-07 17:30:19 I’m sure oil and gas will  be a drag on all indexes as well.  There is a price dislocation between stocks and oil futures with supply spilling over

to me it's more likely they are trying to expand the trade war playing field
1085 2018-11-07 17:23:02 for all the scared shorts out there, stocks don't jump like crazy when they get de-listed, if that were true everyone would buy stocks the day the got de-listed, it's a bad thing, a very bad thing, $MDXG fought de-listing for months for a reason.
1086 2018-11-07 17:22:56 The tax cut helps the 1% bc when congress dropped tax rate from 35% to 21% companies started buying back their own stocks they are drowning in money companies such as apple . The tax cut is suppose to pay for its self but will add 912 trillion to the debt .

1145 2018-11-07 16:52:10 Pro Tip: If you want to call someone out for confusing a flow for a stock (or v.v.), don’t say, “Hey, my guy, you’re mixing up your flows and stocks.” If the person is earnestly mixing them up, using “flow/stock” jargon won’t resonate. Instead, be patient & use plain English.

1353 2018-11-07 15:26:44 My guess: If you are looking at the non-financial corporate sector, stocks from the financial sector owned by the non-financial sector are financial assets, not equity liabilities. So a candidate could be cross shareholding between the non-financial and the financial sector.

1368 2018-11-07 15:22:02 Odd that tech sector stocks are taking midterms as such a positive. Seems Trump + Dem House is uniquely positioned for meaningful regulation.

1372 2018-11-07 15:21:06 With options you can bet for or against the underlying securities. 1 contract is 100 shares. So it costs a lot less to be active in big name stocks ie. Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway etc.

1390 2018-11-07 15:14:05 So I think pot stocks still have the potential for parabolic moves. But is there another sector right now where you *actually* are eyeing 20-30% gains in the relative short term? Not talking penny stocks here (I have my picks on that front).

1408 2018-11-07 15:06:43 It;s a fair point you make But it's a mathematical certainty. Timing it is difficult. The word collapse should really be changed to decline. Just pointing out these stocks in theory would be safer. So I recommend you begin accumulating some of these companies.

1518 2018-11-07 14:30:32 Lions. As I outlined for you since last Sunday, the midterm elections played out in the manner in which they were already "priced in" to the market, Scenario #1 (how I covered it). Expect a relief rally in stocks today.

1528 2018-11-07 14:27:16 I agree. I also wonder why we don't call today a recession as measured against never growing above anything from prior crisis o/s of stocks.

1557 2018-11-07 14:16:27 Scott, at a previous job, we studied elections around the world. Succinctly, stocks underperform in the six months prior to an election, then rally in the subsequent 6 mos. The key factor is that the event uncertainty passes, not the particular winner. Markets abhor uncertainty.

1608 2018-11-07 13:47:44 Unfortunately, some times in life, we go from 70k a year, investing in Roth, stocks, charity paycheck deductions, to struggling..tapping that Roth & stocks dry...and people not willing to put up with your health issues...

One day I'll be back on top tho. Been a long struggle tho
1609 2018-11-07 13:47:16 My take: Bonds and USD more clearly discount an imminent economic peak as federal policies halt their pro-growth progress. Stocks still haven’t figured out what’s wrong yet, but they will by Q1.
1610 2018-11-07 13:47:07 Restocked, but not many stocks left!
1611 2018-11-07 13:46:58 Nope, chez micromania/zing. Funko a super mal géré ses stocks donc réserve une grosse partie de la production pour les USA. Décision prise après les premiers envois chez nous. Donc, il est super rare en Europe, je ne pensais pas réussir à l’avoir ;-;

1615 2018-11-07 13:45:06 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 15 stocks Tuesday including $AU, $KNX and  $CDEV.   Top performer was a same-day gain of 36% in $SERV where December 45.0 calls bought for $0.35 closed at $0.47.
1616 2018-11-07 13:44:34 Anybody that RTs anything Nate Silver related on Election Day 2020 should get put in the stocks and subject to a barrage of rotten fruit
1617 2018-11-07 13:44:11 Positive clinical report for $ENDP has been released #pennyStocks #stocks #stockMarket #StockTrading #trader #News
1618 2018-11-07 13:43:59 With Crude oil $WTIC completely beaten down at strong support zone with "oversold" conditions and sentiment very bearish, it might be time to nimble on some stocks in the sector for a quick trade.
1619 2018-11-07 13:43:27 Ima need a raincheck on that. All my stocks are in Avocados rn 
1620 2018-11-07 13:43:23 Since 1946 every single mid-term #election left stocks higher 12 months out, or more specifically the past 18 mid-term elections yielded positive returns for the stock #market.

1622 2018-11-07 13:41:57 I actually looked at this in early October. Compared the performance of stocks which have always been communications and new comm stock performance. Broadly speaking there was no meaningful difference. if anything, the old comm stocks actually performed worse (9/21-10/8)...
1623 2018-11-07 13:41:42 Mortgage Bonds prices, Stocks rise after the midterm elections produce a split Congress.
1624 2018-11-07 13:41:31 Investors love predictability, and with the midterms going the way the odds anticipated, stocks are heading higher before the open, Dow futures +130.  Bond yields holding steady as the Fed kicks off a two day meeting
1625 2018-11-07 13:40:36 Since the characters are chosen does that mean we will get a reveal of wh they are planning to add. I have a prediction where getting crash because after Diablo Immortal acitvisions stocks “crashed” a little, and they might smash to gain money they lost.
1626 2018-11-07 13:40:23 U.S. stocks closes higher on Tuesday,11/06/18: $DJIA +0.68% (+173.3) at 25,635.01, $SPX +0.63% (+17.1) at 2,755.45, $COMPQ +0.64% (+47.1) at 7,375.96.
1627 2018-11-07 13:39:51 Taco Bell and frozen burrito stocks are going to go through the roof
1628 2018-11-07 13:39:20 They would need a massive deal like $AFMD to get any interest IMHO.  Not impossible, but its not the best biotech market for buying stocks for a lotto deals so that's my take with why people avoiding it.  Data is early + Liquidity is a major issue so tutes can't really buy it
1629 2018-11-07 13:38:35 U.S. stocks closes higher on Tuesday,11/06/18: $DJIA +0.68% at 25,635.01, $SPX +0.63% at 2,755.45, $COMPQ +0.64% at 7,375.96, $RUT +0.55% at $1556.10.

1632 2018-11-07 13:37:10 Yessiree. Another identity politics "first". All the others have worked out so well. She surely is representative of her constituency. THAT is what should be disconcerting. They are playing the long game & this proves they are competing. Better wake up MN or buy burka-mfg stocks.
1633 2018-11-07 13:37:02 Can you make recommendations  on US Marijuana stocks? I’m just getting into the space and I’m only aware of a handful of companies.
1634 2018-11-07 13:37:00 3 out of the 4 states including the ones we’ve all been waiting on Utah and Michigan voted yes to Marijuana Legalization!!! It’s game time boys pot stocks should rally nicely today :-D $HIPH $ETII $DAVC $MJNA $NBEV $VPRB $SIPC $TRTC $MJNE $SING $CRON $SNN
1635 2018-11-07 13:36:50 With multiple states voting in favour of recreational or medical marijuana use, pot stocks like $GCAN already looking up big time, watch out ;)

See I just have my Gravity Falls hat - It's pretty great, save for the mesh at the back that lets me get soaked...
1639 2018-11-07 13:35:49 Sewer rat traders making private groups to pump shit stocks. They create a false rise whilst selling into it and ramping fuck out it at the same time. Straight up market abuse from pond scum. I’ll called them all out this morning with only one reply.
1640 2018-11-07 13:35:23 I should focus on the positive.

We voted the Spineless Senator Dean Heller out.

That evil man has been a blight on the lives of Nevadans and we kicked him out on the curb.

This is for Kavanaugh, and healthcare, and your stupid tax scam, and for bump stocks, and everything else
1641 2018-11-07 13:33:39 Why haven’t you banned bump stocks or raised the age to purchase a firearm to 21 like you you said you were going to do? Are you afraid of the NRA?
1642 2018-11-07 13:33:30 Haha kaloka sana may ganyan din akong stocks ng yakult sa ref! Haha
1643 2018-11-07 13:33:25 @TheWholeTruthXX If the Board of Directors is dysfunctional, perhaps the Registry of Joint Stocks has an oversight mechanism for all its registered non-profits. And the Manors! The manors have a big stake in CCN. Isn't anyone watching over this tragic demise?
1644 2018-11-07 13:33:05 What you need to know today 11/07/18:

~US futures rise as GOP keeps Senate & Dems takeover House
~ $MRK due for PDUFA on 11/09 under priority review for Keytruda
~Pot stocks surge PM as Michigan votes to legalize for recreational  use
~ $AMD active PM after $AMZN agreement
1645 2018-11-07 13:32:30 You mean the social security that democrats pulled from for thier budget? Or people not being resposible and self reliant, starting a 401k roth IRA and buying stocks and bonds to ensure thier own future. Medical is more than forcing peopke to buy insurance.
1646 2018-11-07 13:32:16 Evey one have to realize that large amount of @FoxBusiness parent company stocks are owned  by the same Saudi price that own the  second large amount of stocks of twitter ...

1649 2018-11-07 13:30:40 If I didn't care about the results of friendlies I'd probably play an infinite stocks game rather than 4-stocks.
Then again I don't do homie stocks besides equalising the start of the game.
1650 2018-11-07 13:30:02 I'm not sure they are all part of the same plan now...once for sure but I think the likes of TTSA have devided  this plan, Seti will be laughing stocks if full disclosure happens, that's happening now...NASA are clever, i think they are now part of the new disclosure strategy
1651 2018-11-07 13:29:16 Now comes two years of no legislation and myriad investigations.

1652 2018-11-07 13:28:35 Man I am sooo excited to jump into some value stocks like MCD NKE CLX CHD I am so happy to get 25-30 pes for mature companies.  Dumbo mania
1653 2018-11-07 13:28:26 China was going to do well as trade deal would eventually work out but perhaps moreso w/sympathy of the Democrats.  #China, #Brazil #EM still have highest growth potential w/strong leadership. In US, #Fed still raising rates is concern for holding hi-flying, hi-PE stocks/sectors

1656 2018-11-07 13:26:53 Want to see my stocks compound for the next 60 years. 
1657 2018-11-07 13:26:23 Nifty50/500 PE is a signal for a layman like me for buying/selling signal for good stocks. Severe Correction is cruel and doesn't forgives any stk, bull runs makes everybody Big Bull

1660 2018-11-07 13:25:06 Do we know more about Russia's grain production/stocks? 
Do we leave Russia out of the equation as well? 
How about Brazil? 
Or Argentina? 
Australia or Canada? 
Do we really know anything about any country's actual numbers? 
Or is it all just guesses?

1664 2018-11-07 13:22:49 No idea. I don't understand prices just valuations. I may get fully invested before that. ;P some stocks are down already, another 10% correction and there would be  many bargains.

1679 2018-11-07 13:14:44 Pot stocks could do well... But, news can be sold into as well. You will have to guess, like always lol

get ready for a sharp change in world stocks from USDA in the next few months..
1683 2018-11-07 13:13:32 It's just my opinion but I still think that it says a lot that I feel like the crypto markets have legitimate growth potential and that the stock market is just a big Ponzi scheme. I used to have most of my funds in stocks but thinking of switching the ratio
1684 2018-11-07 13:13:03 If you voted for Mike Braun and your family is NOT rich you’re honestly stupid as hell. He’s trying to do away with social security and give tax breaks to the rich so all the rich bastards can sit on their yachts and play with their penises while they watch their stocks rise.
1685 2018-11-07 13:12:40 Man I can't wait to buy some MCD at 27 times or SBUX at 25 times or NKE at 29 times earnings.  Such great value our federal reserve lets us buy stocks at. Ponzi on.

1779 2018-11-07 12:19:42 The fact that both stocks and bonds are rallying on the election result that was widely expected is telling. Traders were set up for tail events.

This is an example where bland "priced in" claims can miss what's really going on.
1780 2018-11-07 12:18:55 Democracts ran the Banking and Regulatory committees when the housing market collapsed and sent the economy into the biggest recession ever.

You have a great play style overall, but you tend to try to end stocks early than dealing guaranteed damage. Also you give a bit too much free space sometimes. Would love to play you more and know you better!
1854 2018-11-07 11:18:56 As a result of the risk associated with penny stock trading, Congress enacted the Securities Enforcement Remedies and the “Penny Stock Act” requiring the SEC to enact rules requiring brokers or dealers to provide disclosures to customers affecting trades in penny stocks.

1977 2018-11-07 09:06:13 #PSN Update reads well and says Autumn picking up as it does for them normally. Interesting new Fibre offering but of course this is unlikely to drive much Revenue /Profit in relative terms. Seems like House Stocks could be coming back into favour. Huge Divvy here. I don't hold.
1978 2018-11-07 09:06:09 nothing finalised yet but there is interest in a tour and we are hoping to get something together next year
1979 2018-11-07 09:05:18 Stocks were down modestly in Asia and higher in Europe, while futures predicted a positive opening on Wall Street.

1982 2018-11-07 09:04:02 How well were the stocks doing when Obama took office in 2008? How well were they doing when he left in 2016? Precisely, this statement is baseless, utterly baseless!

2021 2018-11-07 08:18:32 In a fuller answer. I try my best not to share my thought on stocks I don't hold, unless I believe a blatant fraud is going on. I feel the beauty of shares is that the share price teaches us the lesson. I'm hard headed usually only learn from my own mistakes.

2046 2018-11-07 07:52:47 Asia stocks saw this as mildly bearish and most moved marginally lower with the Nikkei down 0.2% and Shanghai down 0.65% but no signs of any panic anywhere.

2048 2018-11-07 07:50:27 I didn’t address the dollar. I’m conservative but I’m not playing sides here. I could as easily have said stocks rose because the GOP retained the Senate and the Presidency.

2096 2018-11-07 07:01:19 The bear market hasn't even started (other than for many stocks) and there are already calls for the start of the next bull market to begin.

2098 2018-11-07 06:58:23 Could be misleading as lately US stocks have had a massive bull run; mean of the VC industry has historically been weak, it's really about top quartile funds.

2100 2018-11-07 06:56:35 I've had enough of election results watching. it's time to rest and wake tomorrow to trading great stocks, verifying Christmas lights listings and writing fun fiction. I hope at least some of your election wishes came true!

2103 2018-11-07 06:55:00 Then there is the stock market:
When you give large corporations big tax cuts and they buy back shares of their own company then it would appear that their stocks are higher when in fact they're really not.

2116 2018-11-07 06:45:13 I hear what you're saying and on the surface I can sympathize, but as I think on it a bit... Why is waiting 10 days such an imposition? Hell, I sell stocks and I have to wait 5 days to get my money due to "settlement time". Waiting is part of life.
2117 2018-11-07 06:44:32 Dedication and a desire to  succeed are definitely requirements to  achieve superperformance in stocks.  What is not  required is conventional wisdom or a college education

2118 2018-11-07 06:42:50 OK. Back to my vintage film noir kick. Supposedly they used prime lenses (no zoom) to shoot a lot of these old films. Must have taken some solid planning. Need to figure out what film stocks they used. Would be fun to try out for stills. Adox Silvermax is close maybe?

2120 2018-11-07 06:41:25 So... now we go back to a horribly overvalued stock market, juiced by  a finite amount of share repurchases, moving into a rising rate environment. Buy tech stocks.

2132 2018-11-07 06:28:31 Investing on assets/stocks post 30-50% value-correction/erosion is common-sense, but emerging dynamics (external & internal) do not support “overweight” position and continue to remain between risk-light & neutral (25-50% in risk assets & balance in short term fixed income)!

2137 2018-11-07 06:24:46 That's what I wanted to say

Because you live in it, touch and feel.
But the same thing not for stock which you buy.
YOU can't touch or feel your stocks.

2150 2018-11-07 06:13:51 Just name and shame and expose them for the nasty little pricks they are. We used to have stocks for twats. If I employed one of them, would I have grounds to sack them? Maybe this is an area the law could change and provide a consequence to bad actions for idiots.

2171 2018-11-07 05:53:10 Nice to see a bounce back. Such a roller coast last week, should have balls of steel. I guess you sold some stocks or rebalance your core. Thank for sharing. US MJ tomorrow oh yeah
2172 2018-11-07 05:52:39 Yeah I know. I used to live in Belmar. My grandmother from Newark called it Taylor Ham and we called it pork roll. Fortunately Publix stocks it in FL. For pizza I recommend Vic's in Bradley Beach. Thin crust, garlicky tomato sauce, tangy cheese.
2173 2018-11-07 05:52:04 I don't wonder at all, I've got more important things to think about, like my stocks ;-)

2196 2018-11-07 05:36:36 Job growth was unbroken from early Obama. The best thing Trump did was nothing. Then he and @GOP did that disastrous tax giveaway. Stocks falling, clouds on horizon again.
2197 2018-11-07 05:36:17 Wish I could get a “do over”. I started to sell all of my stocks and mutual funds today, but felt there was a majority of people in the U.S. that opposed Socialism. I guess I’ll pay for that assumption.  The majority house members will work hard to obstruct progress.
2198 2018-11-07 05:36:15 Chairman of House Banking Committee! Better sell your bank stocks!
2199 2018-11-07 05:35:58 $SNS.V $SIC.V both were up 10%+ today. $DCOP.V slowly picking up. $ISM.CA $EAST.V both are still halted. Bought $HUGE $HUGE.CA at 0.46 yesterday and sold it at 0.50 today. $ACB is still lagging compared to other MJ  stocks and I might switch to other US MJ stocks if it continues

2203 2018-11-07 05:31:17 Going through last couple days of the stream. 100% talk about "elections". No stocks. Everyone's on sidelines. All good.
2204 2018-11-07 05:30:23 Let's just say I'm going to buy stocks in paper-shredder companies in the AM.
2205 2018-11-07 05:29:34 The stock market has flat lined and broke even in 2018. Not sure you have any stocks or a 401k but breaking even is not good. Wage growth is flat and interest rates and inflation is up. Tax break went to corporations for stock buy backs and the tax bill has a negative approval
2206 2018-11-07 05:28:00 Joint Jelly. Yes. I'll wave to you when Citibank puts you in the stocks.
2207 2018-11-07 05:27:08 We are in for 2 years of chaos and gridlock, and the economy taking a dump. Peolsi and Waters are going to attack everything Trump has done, its not going to be pretty. Expect unemployment to go up and stocks to be pre Trump levels by the new year.
2208 2018-11-07 05:26:43 Today stocks higher; EUR/USD 1,145; bund yield 0.44%; 10-yearTreasury 3.19%; brent $72.0; gold $1226.0 Watch: Germany industrial production; eurozone/Italy retail sales; Poland interest rate decision; FOMC meeting; U.S. midterm elections
2209 2018-11-07 05:25:24 I am going to start researching pharma stocks to short.  It would be smart for Democrats to go after drug prices.  This is something Trump would agree to and would hurt candidates in 2020 who vote against it. #Midterms2018

2213 2018-11-07 05:21:21 Unfit? Really? He is not a politician! But he gets results: ISIS disappearing, jobs soaring, my retirement stocks great! Senate is Red!
2214 2018-11-07 05:21:08 Just wait for it.  Stocks will crash, economy cannot sustain the spending going on in DC.  Healthcare will get worse. People are working more for less. It’s going to come to a head soon. It’s all on paper. This booming economy while $1.3T deficit and $22T debt is not getting paid
2215 2018-11-07 05:19:48 We can help you namaste in marketing your brand! We are also investing heavily in buying stocks of your company..
2216 2018-11-07 05:18:48 Stocks should see an increase tomorrow. Something Democrats hate to see. Winning!
2217 2018-11-07 05:18:04 Top 5 mistakes investors commit-
1.Investing in co.s with CORPORATE GOVERNANCE issues.
2.Investing BLINDLY in 52 wk low stock.
3.Investing BLINDLY on tips/sms.
4.Investing on LOW VOL penny stocks.
5.Investing WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF FUNDAMENTALS.

2218 2018-11-07 05:17:19 Outside of maybe $BNS, this is the best value growth stock that's so cheap on the TSX.   (Not counting #potstocks / weed stocks, as they are not properly valued yet).

2225 2018-11-07 05:12:21 DJ futures + 150. Hong Kong +1.5%. Global markets have bottomed and will help fuel the next big move higher in US stocks.

2407 2018-11-07 02:46:21 Training requirements and passing a test for all. No permits for anyone with violent convictions.  Registration and insurance like for cars.  Red flag laws for anyone with domestic violence issues. Banning bump stocks.      I support having guns but there needs to be restrictions
2408 2018-11-07 02:46:16 Agree I've got some block chain stocks which seem to be picking up as well.
2409 2018-11-07 02:45:17 I dunno if 4 states make it legal there's a good chance pot stocks rocket.  #justsayin

2412 2018-11-07 02:43:48 The first one I don’t quite agree with, it’s supposed to be a provision that allows people to pass their guns down in a will etc even if the gun is “illegal”. 

The second, sure, bump stocks are a problem because it’s essentially cheating the system.
2413 2018-11-07 02:43:20 Dump your stocks! Be ready, head on a swivel 
2414 2018-11-07 02:43:08 Totally possible, I'm feeling pretty bullish stocks after tonight

2419 2018-11-07 02:40:02 You are absolutely correct @YannCly,  It needs a game changing contract to boost this stock. Holding my uav for sooo loong and finally decided to sold half of my stocks yesterday and sold the other half  today, and bought other stocks and made me money just holding overnight.
2420 2018-11-07 02:39:45 It was a good two years.  Now it’s over.   It’s a sad day.   Bye bye stocks.

2428 2018-11-07 02:36:02 Stop mentioning Las Vegas. Las Vegas is the outlier to END all outliers. Some rich nutter decides to stockpile meme-15's and gimmick stocks in order to unload them NY style from a hotel. I'd stake my actual life on nothing comparable to it ever happening again. Hands down.

2451 2018-11-07 02:18:43 -started with stocks, then crytpto and forex after that.
-gave too much attention to indicators at first. Lost a lot of money. Got rid of indicators, started focusing on price action.
My tips to beginners: start on higher TFs, focus on price action and risk management.
2452 2018-11-07 02:15:36 I’m hoping ultimate will have three stocks, eight mins, obv no items, the location map on small, rage off, and a good stage list.

2457 2018-11-07 02:09:12 As you watch the numbers  come in tonight know this. A 500 bu seed wheat customer just cut his order to 100 bu and I'm ecstatic. Stocks were TIGHT and now I have breathing room.

2466 2018-11-07 01:58:55 The NRA's lobbying has resulted in minimal-no mental health screening, or background checks around gun ownership.  They argue automatic rifles, bump stocks and other accessories should be freely available.
2467 2018-11-07 01:58:49 I make more in my check. Im going to see more in my returns. The job I have provides me a 401k and stocks are through the roof. SS has been a mess but with the economy doing better we may be able to actually afford it again. Thats only part of things done in ONLY 2YRS man!
2468 2018-11-07 01:58:44 Stocks are overvalued as is. A correction will take place no matter who wins. Of you’re in it for the long haul, hang tough. What goes down, must go up.
2469 2018-11-07 01:58:39 I think Chinese stocks will rally if republicans lose majority in the house
2470 2018-11-07 01:58:39 Following the 1910 election, stocks fell 5.5% over the next year. In 1930 – which admittedly was in the middle of the Great Depression – stocks plunged more than 40% over the next 12 months.

2473 2018-11-07 01:55:44 I don't think so. Lax economic policies which help cause stocks to go up has nothing to do with Trump and his cultural impact, which people don't like.

2476 2018-11-07 01:53:04 Gun control laws have pass in 26 states in <6 months (& lots pending in midterms). Bump stocks banned in 9 states & counting. ~250K new voters registered by gun control groups. If this keeps up, you'll actually think the knock at your door are cops come to take away all your guns
2477 2018-11-07 01:50:36 Early US midterm results put stocks on edge in Asia
2478 2018-11-07 01:50:32 Further what you won't see is any clear right to own automatic rifles, or accessories such as bump stocks or other devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like automatic rifles. ....
2479 2018-11-07 01:49:42 This election shit as exciting to me as talking stocks 
2480 2018-11-07 01:49:16 Stocks, Dollar, Bond, Yield Tumble as early election result hits. Blue wave theme is derisking in market.
2481 2018-11-07 01:47:39 Actually, if you just scroll through the shitload of Facebook events, there's still like half a dozen free seminars and stuff you could go to for free. A month or so ago I got to go to one about foreign exchange, and some on stocks and investments.
2482 2018-11-07 01:47:27 After the massacre in Las Vegas, @KenCalvert said that he would ban bump stocks. But then he didn't. Why? Because he has received more money from the NRA than any other sitting member of Congress from California. Put people before profits. Vote for @peacock4ca42.

2488 2018-11-07 01:46:01 I think the most important election is how many more states are legalizing marijuana so I know which new pot stocks I should buy
2489 2018-11-07 01:45:23 Stocks ripping on R’s chances of holding the house.  And falling back down again as Dems retake the higher probability.  Seems like we will get a few more lives tonight.  Eurodollars wise Asia range in light volume

2491 2018-11-07 01:43:59 Finally, I had them highlight which companies they wanted to own. Next class, I’m bringing everything they need to research the stocks they chose. By the time they’re out, my incarcerated Kings will have a new and LEGAL way to make money 
2492 2018-11-07 01:43:51 Today with my incarcerated Kings, I brought a copy of my 2017 Brokerage account statement so that they could see what it actually looks like to own stocks. Then, I gave them a list of the 500 stocks in the S&P.

2496 2018-11-07 01:42:38 At some point, the yields part is going to be a headwind for the stocks part.

2505 2018-11-07 01:35:53 Euro stocks fell on Tuesday as investors tried to navigate through different sources of political uncertainty. Commerzbank sank 3.7% and @LMVH (owner of Louis Vuitton) slid 1.7%, while supermarket chain WM Morrison fell 4.0% after reporting lower sales growth in the past quarter.
2506 2018-11-07 01:35:32 Democrats very good for pot stocks, pot companies.
2507 2018-11-07 01:34:38 Of course.  The Dems and Republicans both love to shove the country into unsustainable debt.  The republicans use the debt to help the rich by pumping up stocks and the dems use debt to help the poor.  Forget the middle class.  They have no party that supports them.

2533 2018-11-07 01:18:06 I just figured out how to invest into stocks.
2534 2018-11-07 01:17:35 Something to consider: $XLC is basically brand new and lacks $XLK's (and other SPDR sector ETFs') big boy liquidity so very poss that trader/inst crowd bought the stocks another way.
2535 2018-11-07 01:16:25 Tru, but profit margins on oil products is much higher and I think that is growing at something like 350% yoy. 

I generally agree that marijuana stocks feel a bit bubbly rn tho.

2555 2018-11-07 00:57:47 if the underlying stocks aren't trading, it can't be real. it's only a guesstimate. the futures can only be so disconnected from the underlying asset. equity indexes aren't pricing mechanisms like commodity futures. they exist only for speculation and hedging

2557 2018-11-07 00:56:27 Hi Steve, I'm reading a couple of your books right now. Really informative. I have a question: how do you set trail stops for options? I use IB and it's not as easy to set a stop for options (because of liquidity) as it is for stocks.
2558 2018-11-07 00:53:43 Well, for me, the majority of mass shootings lately have all been accomplished with an AR15 and bump stocks.  I know there are responsible gun owners. My daughter owns an AR 15 and we do have our arguments about gun rights.  But there’s a reason machine guns aren’t legal anymore

2564 2018-11-07 00:49:29 I highly doubt it. Not all memes come as offensive etc. If anything collabing with a person with over 69 million subs on YouTube will increase attention and potentially increase Tesla stocks etc.

2587 2018-11-07 00:27:07 Do you know what happens when the wealthy and corporations make money?  Stocks go up, more jobs, stronger economy.  I don’t hate the wealthy.  The wealthy have provided my ability to work, succeed, build my 401k and take care of my family.
2588 2018-11-07 00:26:13 Well first things first we need to use our political power like it or not most of black America is broke so no they're not going to buy stocks and bonds tying up money that could be used politically
2589 2018-11-07 00:23:35 still sitting on the fence - you best start buying uranium stocks because when they move they are going to move quickly and then you will be chasing much higher prices - you are never going to pick a bottom - even if there is a pull back it won't last - check 2004 charts
2590 2018-11-07 00:22:32 Dies this belong here?   NO!  She is talking to a one who believes trump is doing a good job and country is going in right direction.  Higher stocks DO NOT mean that everything is fine.  WAKE UP AMERICA!
2591 2018-11-07 00:22:27 What gun control did the d put on you had Clinton with mass shootings you had Obama 3ith mass shootings and nothing. It will never happen. So no bump stocks are illegal. Trump did that. That's forward progress. Anyway I said enough and wasted enough time here.

2593 2018-11-07 00:21:26 Starting to make its move. Perhaps the overseas bunt in Cannibis stocks overnight was the catalyst to get people turning heads here. $IHL is dirt cheap & has done the hard yards with respect to the chart/churn
2594 2018-11-07 00:21:20 $SQ $SBUX $BABA $STZ & $GOOGL were my 5 best performing #stocks today.
2595 2018-11-07 00:20:50 37 days ago “Don’t Boo” Heller (R-Adelson) celebrated one year of doing absolutely nothing about assault weapons, bump stocks, background checks for domestic abusers, the mentally ill, even terrorists. America’s most mediocre senator couldn’t even react to a Nevadan tragedy.
2596 2018-11-07 00:20:12 I need these stocks to get rocking and it's over.
2597 2018-11-07 00:18:43 Would not read much into it b/c stocks that outperformed right after the 2016 election subsequently had little to no correlation with Trump approval rating.
2598 2018-11-07 00:18:19 So I have made up my mind. If theDemorats win and want to impeach Trump, I will pull our monies from the banks, cash in all my stocks, close all of my 401’s and IRA’s.  We will play let’s break the banks.

2602 2018-11-07 00:16:29 Ils ont très (trop) vite banaliser la collection. De 10 paires on est passés à 26 là et à chaque fois des stocks plus importants. Mais les 10 premières restent des paires ""d'initiés""
2603 2018-11-07 00:15:29 No one can envision it.  That is why it will happen.  I remember 1980 like it was yesterday.  Inflation would never end. Bonds and stocks were the worlds worst investments. How did that work out. Mirror opposite of this summer.

2606 2018-11-07 00:13:40 apple stocks rise by 30%.

2611 2018-11-07 00:10:26 May be how he started. But I suspect he now has significant unrealized capital gains on his individual stocks that are deterring him from reallocating into diversified funds.
2612 2018-11-07 00:10:26 Stocks and land will always Outlast jewelry.
2613 2018-11-07 00:10:16 Agreed, spending is stimulative and should be positive for stocks with low inflation.  Paul Tudor Jones suggested recently that beyond a certain point, it is rising rates that are the concern. I know you are concerned with GDP in excess of 5%. The Fed seems to be worried with 4%
2614 2018-11-07 00:07:35 Oh you sweet summer child.

2619 2018-11-07 00:00:56 It does.. but lets be real about it. It hasn't worked with EA or Activision. The only time it ever did was when stuff like this just blew up. THEN they learnt. And only THEN they just changed, because their stocks got down. And that's the language they understand. Real effing sad
