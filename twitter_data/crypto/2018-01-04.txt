41 2018-01-04 23:58:17 I think the fundamental issue some of your followers miss @ToneVays is the difference of being invested in a project vs speculating on the latest trends. There are many speculative opportunities in the crypto market but only few investable ideas IMO.
42 2018-01-04 23:58:15 No I stil think you’re a dude. But I believe you bought xrp.
43 2018-01-04 23:58:10 Most who invested in $xrp also got into $XLM and made a killing on both.
44 2018-01-04 23:58:10 I can't really dispute that. I would probably change the first sentence to something like. "Outside of $BTC (and maybe $ETH) every other crypto is unused anywhere." Current crypto investment is almost exclusively driven by speculation - not current utility.

63 2018-01-04 23:56:39 My most pessimistic prediction: Facebook's thinking about a crypto currency. With that in the platform they get to:

 - Cash in on the valuation growth
 - Claim they're "decentralizers"
 - Try to take over the payments space
 - Probably have dominant mining power

68 2018-01-04 23:56:12 2017 was the adoption phase of crypto currencies

2018 is the year crypto currencies boom

If you thought 2017 was crazy, you won't be able to comprehend 2018
69 2018-01-04 23:56:11 Crypto is weird single. Lol
70 2018-01-04 23:56:11 Why isn't Spectre causing a crash in crypto currency?
71 2018-01-04 23:56:10 仮想通貨を始めて約3ヶ月。
短期的な値動きで一喜一憂することが無くなり、長期的な視点で考えられるようになってきた。
72 2018-01-04 23:56:02 1. don’t just throw all your money into bitcoin, other crypto’s have more potential. BTC is slow and the fees are high
2. you do have to pay taxes on all crypto profits (after you cash out(it’s considered property and you have to pay capital gains tax))
73 2018-01-04 23:55:57 Correct! In the crypto world everything is possible and it’s futile to judge it by the conventional thinking.
74 2018-01-04 23:55:56 I think the cheap coins taking over the top 10 has to do with new guys that don’t know much about crypto. That being said it’s a great opportunity to take advantage of those massive pumps and putting those profits back into more stable coins.

78 2018-01-04 23:55:37 Seeing so many people talk about $FUN makes me super happy. This coin is still massively undervalued and deserves the attention it's finally getting.  #cryptocurrency #altcoins #trading #FunFair

80 2018-01-04 23:55:30 Humble crypto predictions for 2018. 10x,100x,1000x gains in some altcoins will be common early on. April will see huge drops in Altcoins as gains flow back into Bitcoin. This redistribution, along with institutional investments, and Lightning, will put Bitcoin at $40K by June.
81 2018-01-04 23:55:22 Just saying, @novogratz should not be trusted when it comes to crypto.  He has no clue what he is talking about.  He has a large stake in BTC and wants it to succeed, that’s all.  He is getting nervous with XRP.
82 2018-01-04 23:55:21 Bitcoin WAS a good idea ... now is the worst operational crypto. No scalability there, sorry.
83 2018-01-04 23:55:09 BK. You have done a fantastic job giving people a very balanced, basic and real understanding of the crypto phenomenon. There are millions of people making some money here and hundreds becoming millionaires and you are part of the reason why. You really should have a show.
84 2018-01-04 23:55:04 Hm? I've been into crypto since early 2013. Let's stay friendly, shall we?

105 2018-01-04 23:53:09 The purpose of crypto is to be decentralized, to eliminate the power hungry mongers from controlling certain aspects such as financial situations in a persons life. For people to accept the coin that Facebook will implement, or Ripple, is allowing the "1%" total control again.

111 2018-01-04 23:52:39 right so what tf is crypto currency
112 2018-01-04 23:52:34 Globally a fair bit. Same for most assets including mega city property prices, Art & the emergence of crypto currencies. Easy money is a big cause of inequality still amazes me how little focus it gets.
113 2018-01-04 23:52:22 I think we are going to start seeing M&A in the #crypto space soon..... not only amongst #crypto companies, but also #crypto companies doing M&A with non-crypto companies & visa versa. Eg. @Ripple acquiring @MoneyGram or @EA acquiring @enjin #IntrestingTimes #NewWorld

116 2018-01-04 23:52:10 looks like they took it down for updates, according to their site. prob to get a piece of the crypto craze
117 2018-01-04 23:52:09 Hmm... I would be cautious to think bitcoin is here to stay.. take a look at its current dominance in the crypto market (34%) and waning. It's was 60% around Nov Dec.  Have no loyalty to no coin my friend. There plenty of bitcoin alternative. BTC network effect is also waning
118 2018-01-04 23:52:09 Au delà de la flambée du bitcoin et autres crypto-monnaies, il y a une tendance de fond qui se dégage .. si j'avais 1€ à placer, j'acheterais non pas du bitcoin, mais j'essaierais de les investir dans la technologie qui se cache derrière ses échanges: le blockchain.

151 2018-01-04 23:48:30 I think thats what is unique and attractive with binance. No fiat. Just all crypto transactions. At least they dont have to deal with the details in handling different currencies. The 12 hr delay is still better rather than transferring fiat to China I think. Still a pain though
152 2018-01-04 23:48:29 To mine crypto
153 2018-01-04 23:48:29 I'm curious what you make of Crypto's. What would your tweet length summary of them be? Is that possible? Lol
154 2018-01-04 23:48:28 The "currency" XRP is unused anywhere. Not even by their own network that banks are jumping onboard for. It's not even being used to by other crypto on exchanges. They also have a lot more supply in escrow. It's an inflationary currency. Value will drop as supply gets increased.
155 2018-01-04 23:48:27 Bought in 2 days ago, crazy climb! Crash the two exchanges no one can buy!
156 2018-01-04 23:48:25 I been holding this since 4 months. What partnership is it ? so many lol
157 2018-01-04 23:48:24 The current worldwide political climate manifesting in the distrust in institutions could well make the crypto boom the largest asset bubble in history. #crypto #cryptothoughts #bitcoin
158 2018-01-04 23:48:18 BRO I NEED MY FUNDS FOR CRYPTO
159 2018-01-04 23:48:16 Just hopped back in yesterday
160 2018-01-04 23:48:14 Nope that is not true! Ripple is centralized and for that reason i dont want it to become head of crypto! BTC is king and will always stay KING!
161 2018-01-04 23:48:14 They control the supply of BCC. You are giving them you BTC in exchange for BCC. They hold onto your BTC for themselves
162 2018-01-04 23:48:07 Checkin crypto every 7 mins lol
163 2018-01-04 23:48:05 Bitcoin's only about $100 off the top of the pennant, if pennant it's gonna be. Dump incoming soon in which case. #crypto
164 2018-01-04 23:47:57 Good to hear, this gives me encouragement I started with with a lil less on binance a couple days ago I’m already up $70 not much but it’s a start.
165 2018-01-04 23:47:49 Teach me the ways of the crypto dude!!!
166 2018-01-04 23:47:41 Use ED with a ledger... despite the recent hack it is realistically the safest exchange IF you use a ledger and withdraw your coins into it immediately after buying. All erc20 tokens can be stored on ledger. Use MEW to manage them once on ledger.
167 2018-01-04 23:47:39 #TRX will overtake #Nem before the end of the day tomorrow! Still growing...

#cyrpto #Bitcoin
168 2018-01-04 23:47:34 I think Bitcoin will soon die. It opened a new door which is fantastic, but lets be honest, using Bitcoin just sucks. Send some to place X to buy coin Z and paid 20$, where I could just get some IOTA and make it for free. The cryptomarket is changing SUPER fast keep that in mind
169 2018-01-04 23:47:28 I'm new to Crypto and this is simple enough to me so far. Trading will take time for me to learn
170 2018-01-04 23:47:23 TRX hakkında ne düşünüyorsunuz?
171 2018-01-04 23:47:17 Ethereum Price Cracks $1,000 as Crypto Markets Surpass $750 Billion...
172 2018-01-04 23:47:01 Exactly. Facebook is known for silencing free speech and conservatives. And regardless of your political orientation, silencing free speech and never good.
173 2018-01-04 23:46:59 Aim to accumulate $BTC not $USDT and value coins by the project, marketcap and btc price. That's how you make real money.  #crypto #bitcoin #altcoins

176 2018-01-04 23:46:47 @CryptoYoda1338 Heya CryptoMaster :) I follow you and have your tweets on a mobile notification. Your article on Ripple, priceless :) Shared it on several sites because people need to understand fundamental value of crypto.
177 2018-01-04 23:46:45 Thanks. I don't really get BCash. I only know its not great...same as Ripple. But see where Ripple went. Good I sold 19.7K. Now its looking deep down. Hope for retrace of 70%
178 2018-01-04 23:46:43 Just remember he ‘earned it’!

184 2018-01-04 23:46:13 Interesting.
185 2018-01-04 23:46:08 I know
186 2018-01-04 23:46:08 In the event of mass bank adoption, having the crypto tied to banks, during a time of economic panic, could lead to a run on the banks. In a hypothetical world where #XRP is the main product of banks, it would severely drop in value. Investors would flea to safety as usual.

192 2018-01-04 23:45:35 $XRP is not my favorite coin because it represents an infiltration by the FIAT mobsters and undermines the entire idea of crypto but it made me money and thats my ultimate goal. I had a target of $3.25 and when I hit it, I bowed out. I have better projects to focus on now.
193 2018-01-04 23:45:35 My entire office is crypto-currency crazy.... you can count me OUT

195 2018-01-04 23:45:22 All of you guys are trying to get into ripple and bitcoin yet have no knowledge of crypto currency and it’s uses. Just trying to get rich quick

198 2018-01-04 23:45:03 With a massive influx of new crypto investors, noisy old projects get a second chance to sell their story with years of experience under their belt.

224 2018-01-04 23:42:57 Come on, #crypto! You're being boring. Entertain me. Dance for me. Tell me a joke. Make me scream at my laptop screen. Make me feel like I'm ten feet tall. Make me throw my mouse in rage.
225 2018-01-04 23:42:48 My thoughts about bitcoin (and by corollary other crypto currencies) are:

1. The value of bitcoin is primarily based on what people are willing to pay for it. This is similar to value of gold for example (not legal tender and no intrinsic value).

245 2018-01-04 23:40:49 1. Okay. Good fact.
2. This is not a sign of a Bubble bursting - at all
3. This is false
4. This happens ALL the time in volitile crypto markets. It’s not evidence of one coin’s bubble bursting.

263 2018-01-04 23:39:02 Gold is a store a value and is a horrible as a currency - a store of value is not a medium of exchange.  No crypto at this moment is good at the latter ~ Scale happens over time, transparency and honesty come at the start. bcash has failed at that

At least, it's not SUPPOSED to.
288 2018-01-04 23:36:47 Is it just me, or is the appropriation of the term "crypto" to mean "cryptocurrency" completely infuriating?
289 2018-01-04 23:36:45 If you're struggling to cop crypto because Coinbase is being a cunt, buy litecoin (if ya have Bitstamp) or find someone who is Bitstamp verified.
Buy litecoin and send to Binance from Bitstamp, works within 15 mins; Bitcoin & Ethereum have withdrawal delays from hours to days.

295 2018-01-04 23:36:24 I guess placing a 15000 $ tag on a first generation crypto, that actually has an unlimited supply via continuous "forks", and saying its cheap is right. #FOOLSPARIDISE

308 2018-01-04 23:35:19 Many of those people don't care about crypto currencies in general, or idea behind it. They don't have money to invest, so they gamble with little money they have, what makes them even more dangerous for the market.

320 2018-01-04 23:34:09 Crypto much more enjoyable 
321 2018-01-04 23:34:09 NXT will hit $1 again eventually, just got to be patient. Especially if there are other airdrops for NXT coming in the future.

Also, buy Tron. I have lots and would like the value to increase.

342 2018-01-04 23:32:39 Besides that will become a sure crypto to be in, by that I mean that they are really a serious company and you can sleep good over night by having a large value in $LSK.
343 2018-01-04 23:32:33 You are my favourite thing on twitter, even though I only got it to research crypto currency. You do some premium tweets.
344 2018-01-04 23:32:28 ?? Proof
345 2018-01-04 23:32:28 I find it fascinating that no has decided to invest their money earlier. The stock market has been around for thousands of years, yet no one cared about investing. Crypto has been around for a decade, now everyone is throwing their hard earned dollars into it without research.

350 2018-01-04 23:32:11 I would just go all in on something like $DRYS. Crypto is for pussies
351 2018-01-04 23:31:55 Lmao the hate for bitconnect is real. Still made 200% of my money and counting. If you would've invested a year ago when most started saying #ponzi they would've made so much. It still could be, doesn't mean money isn't possible still
352 2018-01-04 23:31:49 But btc would loose value bc if people are not fully vested into crypto then banks failing mean people are losing money hence needing their crypto money, right?
353 2018-01-04 23:31:44 It'll happen before the end of the month. This is crypto. Not the stock market
354 2018-01-04 23:31:43 Who else in the Crypto-world has noticed how sleeping baby giants like Smartcash, Substratum, TRON, NLC2 and Wabi are not on Bittrex? Even Cardano was at like 1500% growth before it was listed on there. Also, Binance is literally the slowest website I've ever used.

368 2018-01-04 23:30:54 @DailyZeitgeist @jack_obrien @milesofgray just listened to the Jan 2nd episode. I think the obsession with HQ is an indication of how money hungry everyone is. Same thing with crypto currency. Everyone is just looking for a way out financially.
369 2018-01-04 23:30:48 You guys should rethink your business and scale up. Your shorting a lot of customers the opportunity to invest there funds and gain profits in this amazing profit week for crypto.

395 2018-01-04 23:28:01 If you're afraid any crypto has mooned, sell a *portion* of your holdings.  I think as a general rule, selling 1-5% a week for any coin that's appreciated >2x in last month is a reasonable course of action.

Then you can always rebuy at discount if you were right.
396 2018-01-04 23:27:54 wut ?

401 2018-01-04 23:27:27 RTs NOT Crypto
402 2018-01-04 23:27:23 Yeah that was rhetorical. Those btc virgins r full of shit, they dont care about decentralization, or making the world better thru blockchain, they just want btc to continue to have the biggest market share in crypto so they can profit. The very thing they shit on the banks for
403 2018-01-04 23:27:10 It's 750b a trillion is coming soon!!!
404 2018-01-04 23:27:08 If you made the mistake of putting all your fiat into crypto this early then idk what to tell you. Also, If the banks fail, #xrp looses value, #btc doesnt. Look at failed states for example
405 2018-01-04 23:27:04 Doubles its valuation in 1 hour?.. I'm buying back at the drop. Something is fishy
406 2018-01-04 23:26:58 Couldn't phrase it better. GJ Master. I'm hoping newcomers will do their homework. Ripple isn't crypto and Fiat2.0 isn't the the future I want. Doing my part, at my level.

426 2018-01-04 23:25:20 Buying securities isn't a taxable event, selling them is.

You need to pay taxes on all crypto sales.  Try to hold for a year for lower long-term cap gains rate.

Agree that ripple is very risky, but don't think it's riskier than other cryptos in this one aspect.

437 2018-01-04 23:24:15 Coinbase will add XRP - they care for money too much not to. XRP is different and you are obviously threatened by it not being some dark coin. Banks have been throwing lots into crypto and @Ripple have the answers. I really need to make a list of all the banks that have signed up
438 2018-01-04 23:24:12 Coinbase did an article of most influential cryptos of 2017 and didnt include the BEST PERFORMING crypto of 2017 XRP. Im done with their biases

448 2018-01-04 23:23:32 @CryptoMessiah am I doing this right?
449 2018-01-04 23:23:24 That might save your sanity, I guess...
450 2018-01-04 23:23:19 Any suggestions on crypto wallet outside of an exchange? I know there alot of options but not all allow for different types of crypto only main type
451 2018-01-04 23:23:06 alex, new to Crypto, listening to you in the room, all day, for the last several days..... I need help..... advice how to get serious understanding how to invest in Crypto?
452 2018-01-04 23:22:57 I've been known to demolish an overly large portion of chicken nuggets before now yes?
453 2018-01-04 23:22:49 Imaginary value. Wait are you saying crypto coins are just like gold? You cray connie but I’m sold where do I buy
454 2018-01-04 23:22:39 sure!  always!
455 2018-01-04 23:22:32 As long as it doesn't bring down the rest of crypto, some lessons just need to be learned the hard way.
456 2018-01-04 23:22:32 i’m cashing in on crypto currency big time this whole year. letting it sit for 5-10 years. hopefully i become a millionaire or s/t cool
457 2018-01-04 23:22:29 You know there's other crypto currencies that can make money besides XRP? I think there is plenty of money to be made with probably the intended use of crypto currencies which is to not be controlled by the banks. It is unreal the ignorance in this world despite the internet.
458 2018-01-04 23:22:27 Bloody hell, got 19.8k followers too. (Almost double than u, the real one ). This new $Crypto Nub army need to be educated on an exponential scale. Fact check peeps...always
459 2018-01-04 23:22:27 Simplex stopped taking my money and won’t say why. So no more changelly for this guy. Looking at other avenues of fiat-crypto exchange. Kracken is taking time to verify
460 2018-01-04 23:22:21 Pasa de bitso a #Poloniex o #Binance ellos te permiten crear una wallet para que puedas mandar #Crypto de una a otra
461 2018-01-04 23:22:21 Sure about that? China's done more in the last 10 yrs than the West in the last 100.
462 2018-01-04 23:22:13 Followed and added to crypto list. Thanks!
463 2018-01-04 23:22:06 hopefully the venue has a gas leak that day and the whole building goes up in flames with everyone inside
464 2018-01-04 23:21:58 holy shit, is that as big of a deal possibly to the "crypto" related stocks and all crypto as i think it is
465 2018-01-04 23:21:55 Thankyou
466 2018-01-04 23:21:53 People keep making the "bitcoin will be myspace of crypto" argument , but they mistake company vs protocol. "Oh, then it's VHS vs DVD"! No, it's so fundamental to trustless value exchange that it would be the "electricity" to "DVD".
467 2018-01-04 23:21:52 Technology will beat marketing at the end. Real Privacy is a Holy Grail #xvg #vergecoin
468 2018-01-04 23:21:46 I think there are some brilliant crypto traders out there who are making $$$ it's just not my thing going down the market cap and trading these small coins. I don't have the time. I think second guessing the movement of flows is the best trading strategy. What comes after #XRP?
469 2018-01-04 23:21:45 My new edition of Scientific American arrived today with a cover story on crypto-currencies. This is as damning as the "Bull Market" cover on Time magazine.  When the crypto-currency bubble pops, I just hope it doesn't take the economy down with it. #bitcoin
470 2018-01-04 23:21:42 @AuditChain Real-Time Accounting and Auditing. Check out that team, $AUDT where fundamentals and technicals align
471 2018-01-04 23:21:41 the main reason i stopped supporting Ripple Labs and their XRP coin is due to @bgarlinghouse being a liar talking trash about bitcoin to shill the (Non Crypto-Currency) coin XRP . he is a straight up liar that bitcoin is losing market dominance .
472 2018-01-04 23:21:40 Sold 50k xrb at 2k sats to buy moar $MSP, so yes, please
473 2018-01-04 23:21:27 Follow my earlier tweets fucking dumbfucks. I told this when it was exist in the first day! #bitconnect  is absolute scam!! Im fucking almost  6 years in crypto ive been through many scams and this was very obvious one!
474 2018-01-04 23:21:26 Almost everyone I spoke with 5 years on the merits of #Bitcoin & #crypto have recently reached out to me over the holidays. 

Popular questions included:

"Do you still have your Bitcoin?"
"How many Bitcoin do you have?"
"How do I buy?"

Better late than never I guess 
475 2018-01-04 23:21:14 Charlie you have to understand that most of them has barely been in the crypto space for 6 weeks if not 6 days. Don't sweat it man, you have a strong community behind you and we all know that Litecoin is Neo and Bitcoin is Morpheous. These are all agent smith agenda to get at you
476 2018-01-04 23:21:13 Crypto will not take over fiat currency. Governments and central banks won't allow it. Don't underestimate  them, their own greed, and their power.
477 2018-01-04 23:21:12 Hey Cyrpto Family!

489 2018-01-04 23:20:39 If your looking to convert USD to Crypto to send to other exchanges, please be aware the #Coinbase #GDAX is quick to take your money, slow to provide it to you, and very slow to send it elsewhere (from my experience).
490 2018-01-04 23:20:34 No offence but all my shitcoins did better and I basically chose them out of a hat
491 2018-01-04 23:20:16 why do you say that?
492 2018-01-04 23:20:10 I think a good portion of people invested in Bitcoin understand basic economics and expect an organic economy to develop around crypto in time. Nevermind that it is right now the easiest way to quickly move value around the planet. #notaponzi

515 2018-01-04 23:18:09 It's just texas though. Also bitconnect doesn't need to be a ponzi to make money, you'd earn more money just by holding the money in BTC, bitconnect is like a coin wallet that pays 50% of your coins worth in the end lol
516 2018-01-04 23:18:08 Ah it only applies in Texas but they can still register in the correct way (they won't)

529 2018-01-04 23:17:11 You seems to know a lot about crypto. Can you teach me more?
530 2018-01-04 23:17:01 Os recuerdo que el 95% de las ICOS/cryptos son mierda, scam para timar a la gente. Tened mucho cuidado donde metéis el dinero que no todo lo que reluce es oro

532 2018-01-04 23:16:30 Actually Texas has included the right to own crypto currencies in the state constitution. They just don't like scams. ;)
533 2018-01-04 23:16:13 I do not believe hype about crypto geniuses. Crypto investors got lucky with an oddball play on something illiquid, just because it looks exotic to outsiders.
534 2018-01-04 23:16:12 @XVGWhaleReal I was one of those hates kept asking you to not to tweet.. (I still ask you to not to do "mooning" tweets lol). But you don't deserve hate brother. .love..tc
535 2018-01-04 23:16:09 benim kastettiğim şekilde coini yarı yarıya iki borsaya dağıtmanızı tavsiye ederim. Sadece riskten korunmak için değil. Eğer full time trader iseniz %5'lik farkın ayda 5-6 defa gerçekleştiğini göreceksiniz :)

You know crypto and $TRX have gone main stream when you are running into TRX HODLERs in public! #TheMovement
546 2018-01-04 23:15:03 MTL'yi özel olarak takip etmedim. Ancak bazı istisnai durumlar oluyor sizinki de ona denk gelmiş gibi. coinin wallet'ı borsaların birinde kapanıyor ve kapalı markette dump ya da pump oluyor. :(
547 2018-01-04 23:15:02 #fun isn't the type of coin that takes my fancy, it doesn't mean I see anything wrong with it. I keep hearing people rave about it and there's numerous sources I trust that highly recommend it
548 2018-01-04 23:14:55 Yeah, it's a solid investment. But its one that's irritating me so much. I have a lifetime feud with Ripple. Reason I started with crypto was because of the whole decentralized-no-middle-man thing. And that's not Ripple 
549 2018-01-04 23:14:54 Better than selling any of your crypto stash

561 2018-01-04 23:13:50 Sure, but a lot of things need to line up beyond typical crypto attacks. You need to be able to trigger reads from the buffer or clashing cache lines, besides having a service with the vulnerable code path to begin with. I will be impressed if someone finds an exploitable service
562 2018-01-04 23:13:47 No actually it is only the ico they are attempting. ICO's are considered securities. Unfortunately Texas or any other state doesn't have any ability to govern the supposed crypto currency trading bot.

564 2018-01-04 23:13:41 Ya. If every coin was judged by their actual use cases, coupled with the teams and experience, $CSC would be top 50 based on current market caps.

569 2018-01-04 23:13:14 Thanks for getting it back up. It is unfortunate to be down, but hopefully u can scale up the spread the load across servers to prevent this going forward. Crypto’s are just to volatile to not have 100% uptime. Best of luck.

571 2018-01-04 23:13:12 Story said nothing about crypto currency. Must have been written by a no-coiner. 
572 2018-01-04 23:13:11 Actually the crypto space is worth $215 trillion because that's the value of total global currency according to a google search I just did. When do I get to be on your show to pump crypto??
573 2018-01-04 23:13:07 No offence my friend but you don’t know what you’re talking about. There has been very very few losers in Crypto. Data proves that.

589 2018-01-04 23:12:03 Yeah you will  You're so fun dude!
590 2018-01-04 23:11:56 That awkward moment when someone doesn't understands the word revolution...
591 2018-01-04 23:11:53 Thank you for your time. I respect your views also. I hope the whole crypto industry succeeds and things really change the world.

597 2018-01-04 23:11:07 Variation 1 remote attack is not hard. Crypto libraries purposely jitter network responses exactly to prevent this type of attacks (particularly leaking private keys)

604 2018-01-04 23:10:31 OS can mitigate meltdown at least, that's what Linux Kaiser patches do. There will be further advances in these kinds of attacks, similar to crypto
605 2018-01-04 23:10:28 You don't need to double it, 10, 30, 60, 30 is perfectly fine and its faster for reversals. 20, 60, 120 is more conservative.

607 2018-01-04 23:10:19 Like I said if governments/world bank feels threatened they might just steal it and make it their own. I find it hard to believe crypto will just disappear because of regulations.

617 2018-01-04 23:09:16 Doğru ve sadece bir sebebi bu. Ambargo altındaki ülkelerin cryptorublelari (Rusya) petro (Venezuela) kripto kaçış olarak btc ye alternatif olacak. Eth zaten Exchangelerde baz para olarak yerini aldi. Utility tokenler gerçekten kullanılmaya başlanması. Bunlar $btc yi gömer.

619 2018-01-04 23:09:00 #TRON is an interesting idea for use of blockchain for digital content distribution & mgmt. While that's cool, it would NOT require a special #cryptocurrency (the TRON coin).  Just like almost every #altcoin, not much real use case for the coin itself. Crypto pump and dump.
620 2018-01-04 23:09:00 What I love about @coinbase and @brian_armstrong is that they see crypto as something that can fundamentally change people's lives. Their asset criteria shows how principled they are. I have faith in their integrity and future decisions. No vaporware, P&D coins. History watches.
621 2018-01-04 23:08:54 青いのショートチャンス逃したのは残念である
622 2018-01-04 23:08:52 Regardless, the idea of it is clearly better than paying banks for money. Almost anyone will agree with that. These are the beginning stages of a world crypto. Could be VASTLY different before it becoming a world currency IF it does.
623 2018-01-04 23:08:50 We don't want of yo old ass Bitcoin Cash, bitcoin is still alive because its the first crypto currency, and all the coin are paid in bitcoin, we dont give a fuck about who is better, Ethereum is better than bcash, ripple too, stellar too, cardano too.

Bcash is owned  by 2 man.
624 2018-01-04 23:08:48 I see 2018 as the year big money starts investing in crypto.
It could also be the year banks start doing all their settlements in crypto.
If only the first is true, I see it getting to $8-10T, the banks however could get it to $100t if not a lot more.
625 2018-01-04 23:08:40 Well said..... scary thing with crypto is obviously the unknowns... buddy said to me the other day.. ok let’s get in... then said... ok so what’s our exit strategy/end game.... we just paused lol... it’s a great question
626 2018-01-04 23:08:38 @BitcoinTre I'm new to Crypto. What is the best wallet to store all my Alt-coins? I have Exodus and can't figure out how to use it. Is it compatible with most coins? I don't get it.
627 2018-01-04 23:08:34 best article about the other side of Ripple.  Thanks Crypto Yoda !
628 2018-01-04 23:08:31 Looks like crypto has returned to the "coin must have billions of tokens in circulation to get volume" cycle. Yall remember quark coin speaking of..?
629 2018-01-04 23:08:26 Sorry Ryan but that article is BS.

Every tech and fintech company has been calling their money apps "wallets" going back as far as Nokia in the late 90s

I know big tech is trying to get crypto and apple has hooks into finance now but one doesn't obviate the other

633 2018-01-04 23:08:12 Don’t put too much into Ripple XRP, people are doubting it’s future since it’s not an actual  crypto currency.
634 2018-01-04 23:08:04 Is a stable, liquid, spendable #cryptocurrency important to push #Crypto into the mainstream?

641 2018-01-04 23:07:40 depending on the crypto, most is GPU so that should remain unchanged, CPU based coins will take a hit, but then again who patches?

643 2018-01-04 23:07:37 Generally in crypto, if you're holding an asset that has appreciated by more than 2x in the past month, I think it's wise to start dollar-cost-averaging selling some.  Can't lose money taking profits.  

I don't think this is a bad place to sell, but certainly could keep going up

652 2018-01-04 23:06:51 O coin dump yediğinde binance önden düşecek ve dibe ulaşıp ulaşmadığına bittrex'e bakarak karar verecek. O zaman da keşke bittrexte olsaydım diyeceksiniz. Coinleriniz iki borsada da varsa eşit miktar iki borsaya da dağıtın.

653 2018-01-04 23:06:51 Chart looks good in btc terms, volume is starting to pick up, Russian elections coming in March, Putin just put out a statement regarding interest in cryptoruble, and the rap song is already out. I know nothing about the technicals but those don’t matter in bull market

660 2018-01-04 23:06:16 Why does that matter? Stop living in the past man crypto is the future. Shit, banks might steal the idea once they realize the majority of the world wants it. Who knows. Japan is the first of many I THINK that will adopt a crypto as a legal currency.
661 2018-01-04 23:06:16 Okay @coinbase. We KNOW you are going to add #xrp anyway even you do not wish to admit it yet. It would be a nonprofit action NOT to add it to your assets as its the 2nd crypto right now and it might does not match certain ideologies.  Considering your actions are commercial.

690 2018-01-04 23:04:15 It’s a legal form of currency there.  That’s not surprising considering the inventor of Bitcoin used a Japanese alias and that the country is responsible for the vast majority of Crypto returns.

697 2018-01-04 23:03:23 Society functions well-enough even trading IOUs because the public believes they are money and it turns out that's the only requirement for something to be money is for people to believe in it as such, which again is why crypto will take over as more people become used to it.
698 2018-01-04 23:03:22 @CityNewsAmanda Didn’t like yorr piece for the consumer awareness piece near the Family Stop. You’re perpetuating hyperbole to the already uninformed. Do better. Crypto is an amazing paradigm SAFER than a banking bureaucracy.

713 2018-01-04 23:02:00 Americans really need a better crypto exchange that Coinbase. From the simple fact that they're guilty of insider trading, to the fact that they ever added a scamcoin (3 month old BTC fork run by conmen) to the fact that thousands of wire transfers are month late...disgusting.

721 2018-01-04 23:01:45 "coinvinced". It's when you hear someone convince someone else to buy crypto currency 
722 2018-01-04 23:01:42 The crypto beef is gonna be good for business.
723 2018-01-04 23:01:38 The Crypto Commies.
724 2018-01-04 23:01:37 Increased awareness by institutions in crypto, Facebook I think is going to launch its own currency, and then I don’t know.

739 2018-01-04 23:00:24 It’s interesting to see how many people in crypto value politically and financially centralized tokens, since it seems to deviate from the original idea of decentralization and freeness (as in speech) that early projects claimed
740 2018-01-04 23:00:23 @BKBrianKelly Congrats on the crypto ETFs! @OSTK
741 2018-01-04 23:00:19 Not much detail but @BKBrianKelly is working to launch a suite of “crypto” ETF products.
742 2018-01-04 23:00:19 Don’t put your money in xrp. Those that tell you that know nothing about crypto and you’re allowing bankers to get back btc and eth for a shitcoin. Invest in xvg during the dips and trx, both decentralized. Watch the market cap white papers. Circulating supply doesn’t matter much
743 2018-01-04 23:00:11 China, India, Korea, and Japan do not care about your idealistic view about crypto. Your Guy Fawkes conspiracy theories are laughable to them. They live centralization 24 hours a day. #XRP

751 2018-01-04 22:59:45 Charlie lee is a God in crypto. You silly sons of bitches dont understand that he unleashed one of the truest crypto currency that will be used in everyday transactions. Now think of these other coins like a scratched dvd frm blockbuster rental you think you own them but do you?
752 2018-01-04 22:59:45 It wasn’t a particular announcement but more of a strong endorsement for where we are headed and Crypto’s are going to flourish!  Mainstream acceptance is on its way!
753 2018-01-04 22:59:44 Oh, so you're an Ico girl huh? I'm making it a point to get involved in some more ico's, especially with some really good ones coming up really soon.  I had my highest Returns on the one Ico I did, $MCO.  Mind if I ask what group that is you are in? Always looking 4 great info.
754 2018-01-04 22:59:41 @caneofc Really appreciate you doing all this with Crypto Cartel, watched periscope and have since joined the discord, the amount of knowledge/talent I recognize on the admin/honcho board is super impressive. thanks for doing this, will help me and so many others out so much.

759 2018-01-04 22:59:15 Started off snorting it, that used to work
760 2018-01-04 22:59:12 Also hard to find people with "normal" names like John Smith in the crypto space.
761 2018-01-04 22:59:11 One thing I have learnt when crypto-trading is NEVER chase a boom.

I just made a very stupid, yet also calculated decision to invest in $TRX after a 110% boom in 24 hours...

This should be fun! 
762 2018-01-04 22:59:11 These are related to mining crypto currency somehow.
763 2018-01-04 22:59:06 Acrually this kind of everywhere optimism will be our downfall. When everyone is on board there are no buyers and the market crashes.
764 2018-01-04 22:59:00 great move, $ETP will be mooning soon :)

773 2018-01-04 22:58:43 First two items on @BBCNewsnight exactly the same. The kids are addicted to social media likes, the adults are addicted to crypto currency speculation.
774 2018-01-04 22:58:33 Ripple is a hedge against a large investment of crypto. Nothing wrong with a little ripple in your life....
775 2018-01-04 22:58:31 Gün içerisinde kademeli olarak 530-600 bandından aldım. 700de kar ile sattım. ivme kazanınca 720den tekrar aldım. 750 ve 725e sefer satış emri vermeme rağmen olmadı şimdi beklemek durumundayım. Gün içerisindeki al-sat imkanları için "destek-direnç" analizi mi yapmak gerekir?
776 2018-01-04 22:58:26 I am new to crypto but would like to win some XVG. When will you announce winners
777 2018-01-04 22:58:25 You realize a bunch of these surges are coming because companies are getting involved with crypto?  Companies that have done that have soared like 30% in the past week

787 2018-01-04 22:58:03 Congrats @BKBrianKelly on the crypto ETF. Any timeline on when they will become available?

803 2018-01-04 22:56:49 I hate when I'm trying to give some mofo money and their site is as inept as their service. With so much talk of crypto and people wanting to test it out you'd think these dumb mofos would have their sites ready and usable.
804 2018-01-04 22:56:46 Stock is part ownership in a company. Part ownership in ACTUAL products. Crypto is a free form of exchange of value. There is no ownership into a company/product. Completely different.

812 2018-01-04 22:56:04 Why would they sell access to their bot if it was as legit as they claim?
813 2018-01-04 22:56:04 This newsnight crypto interview is embarrassing for the host bless him. He’s clearly out of his league and they’re focussing on the scam element with not much positivity. Nice fair reporting 
814 2018-01-04 22:55:58 Banks & government want to take the shine off decentralization

825 2018-01-04 22:55:31 Crypto is globalizing East Asian-style financial bubbles.

836 2018-01-04 22:54:35 They're trying to survive.. All these banks are entrenched into the current market system with large derivative books (Deutsche bank).

845 2018-01-04 22:53:36 if you invest in ADA/TRX you will get 300/600 £ profit within a year.

846 2018-01-04 22:53:35 Ultimately. Total decentralisation is the ultimate dream of miners, and anarchists. But, the bank of England,  etc etc is here to stay. It's better to work with it, and let it organically grow with a crypto currency it accepts, than pretend some crypto bank is going to replace it
847 2018-01-04 22:53:30 Im just starting to learn more about crypto. What resources do you use for your research and how do you look for opportunities in the crypto world?

850 2018-01-04 22:53:10 That’s awesome. Waiting a day is like a year in crypto-fantasy-land. But look at it on the bright side: perhaps you’ll miss the alt-crash.
851 2018-01-04 22:53:10 The crypto market is taking steps backwards for the International economy by trying to gain superiority over banking systems that have kept the economy relatively stable for 70+ years.  I would rather trust the trials and errors if history over people who rely on line graphs.

2. Progress continues thanks to technology & increasing stability of developing markets
3. Although everything feels toppy only exogenous risks can slow us down (i.e. Korea)
4. Crypto exchanges can’t handle requests for new accounts

925 2018-01-04 22:47:44 in what shape or form does this resemble a well researched short play like EROS, other than a general hope that the ICO is not successful and that OSTK is only up due to overall crypto mania and nothing else. both are way too speculative to base a strong short argument on.
926 2018-01-04 22:47:42 I'd love to hear the counter
927 2018-01-04 22:47:41 I have to agree. Over the holidays someone heard about the creator of LTC "selling out". They don't know jack about crypto and their perception of course is that this was extremely negative. Charlie should buy back in.

933 2018-01-04 22:47:24 @360_trader serious question that perplexes me. What is the end game with crypto investing? Do you believe we’ll actual use it for daily purchases in the future or is it basically a stock for a technology to sell off when the time is right? Will crypto really be used in future?

936 2018-01-04 22:47:15 Roaring 20s:
- Mass overspeculation of stocks due to the public becoming involved with trading instead of just professional investors
- Stock Market has no regulation for the buying and selling of stock

Crypto:
- Mass overspeculation by the general public
- Little regulations
937 2018-01-04 22:47:05 It does not necessarily need to be #crypto, but if you are right now not investing in any form in the 4th Industrial Revolution (e.g. blockchain, IoT, VR, AI, AR, drones, 3D printing) you are missing out on the biggest financial opportunity of your life.

940 2018-01-04 22:47:01 The conversations we’re havin in Argentina right now consist of whether or not we should hop on a flight to Colombia in the morning and rent out Pablo Escobars Penthouse to trade crypto & party in for a few days.
941 2018-01-04 22:46:51 In short #ETC has been focused on cleaning up and fixing the mess that Ethereum Foundation left when they Forked off the main chain to bailout a select group of investors. 
ETC didn’t participate in the ICO goldrush - Good thing too. 
Now onto the next phase
942 2018-01-04 22:46:46 Facebook is not the place to exchange news about # crypto. It’s late on everything. You need to be on Twitter and Reddit for the quickest news.

956 2018-01-04 22:45:11 I have received a lot of message on how to buy Tron and Paccoin. Tron can be bought on binance and Paccoin can be bought on cryptopia. There are news/rumors that binance will be adding Paccoin to their exchange soon. If it does going to the moon like Cardano, Tron and Ripple.

977 2018-01-04 22:43:36 And yeah the point I’ve been making for almost 2 months now is it truly is the best scalability crypto I’ve seen. IOTA gained a $12B market cap for scalability. But in reality I would pick Pascalcoin over IOTA for scalability, all things considered. And PASC is 150x cheaper.

Vatanima boynumun borcudur. Bildiklerimi bana kalmasın. Elbirliğiyle yeni dünya düzeninde yerinizi alalım.
991 2018-01-04 22:42:22 los análisis técnicos, candle sticks y todo eso casi no aplica en crypto, esto es muy volátil y en cuestión de horas hay mucha variación, la verdad es que nadie puede predecir qué le va a pasar a un proyecto porque también afectan hasta las noticias que salen
992 2018-01-04 22:42:21 Let me drop this question for all the big boys in Crypto: What do you think about Snovio (SNOW) @BitcoinTre @Altcoinbuzzio @CryptoNickk @DiaryofaMadeMan @snovio_ico @_CryptoLove_ @tripjammer @tailopez @Cointelegraph @coindesk
993 2018-01-04 22:42:20 Yeah, I guess it is semantics.  I actually agree with what you said, pretty much.  Crypto is a bit like holding chips at a dodgy unlicensed casino. Getting out with spendable funds is NOT a given.
994 2018-01-04 22:42:17 What is the best source for merchants who accept certain crypto payments? 

I'm particularly interested in Bitcoin Cash, but am not really all that picky.
995 2018-01-04 22:42:11 C'mon 40 bux .... (roll)
996 2018-01-04 22:42:06 Maybe you should open a @Goldmoney account, send them your gold, then sell it for crypto. Because they also do crypto. If you do, use referral code jcgold
997 2018-01-04 22:42:01 See every coin rising like hell , but the only coin which is so undervalued , XVG wont explode. Can't understand the people, it's  fast + anonymity is great, and the people invest in crypto like trx or ripple
998 2018-01-04 22:41:50 We depend on those #FOMO buyers to pump the price up. Plain and simple. You win some you lose some, but if they’re losing consistently in crypto, they might need to find another hobby.

1002 2018-01-04 22:41:34 There are a ton of parallels between the reasons for the Great Depression and the current state of the crypto economy.  I’ve already gone over most of them if you would like to take a look at my Replies.

1007 2018-01-04 22:41:12 We all know that banks will succeed in the end. At least primarily. Currencies like Ripple are already working with banks. In case you didn't know, the primary "purpose" for crypto is to take banks out of the equation.
1008 2018-01-04 22:41:12 Gotta love crypto :D

1011 2018-01-04 22:40:57 looks like we will be having a bull run like in 2014 OTC market about cannabis and also in crypto... cannabis is a solid ground for a coin to sustain it's value & purpose for a long long time...
1012 2018-01-04 22:40:57 My Wall Street buddies texted me this, I laughed at it...
1013 2018-01-04 22:40:56 Ripple isn’t the 2nd most expensive crypto. It’s the 2nd most valuable. It’s still cheap in a per coin perspective.
1014 2018-01-04 22:40:38 i really am curious and don't understand all this crypto stuff. i feel i can trust charlie and wanted to ask him so i could make sense of who i have to give my money to
1015 2018-01-04 22:40:38 Exchange on Etherdelta right now is 1 ETH=  about 2 Million KIN
1016 2018-01-04 22:40:37 He sucks at crypto ?
1017 2018-01-04 22:40:33 @maxkeiser 
Hi Max, 
Can you shill us a little bit on your involvment with Startcoin? It's quite bullish ATM. Thank and long live crypto.
1018 2018-01-04 22:40:30 so much jealousy and envy against us XRP HODL's in the crypto space...they mad cuz we came up and they still broke!

1022 2018-01-04 22:40:25 A buddy at work just said, "Crypto is the new cross fit. Once you start you can't stop talking about it." He's not wrong. Welcome to Crypto. GAINS ALL DAY (unless you invested in a token that made you loose all your money, just be carful out there and learn before investing).
1023 2018-01-04 22:40:23 Beyond an ever increasing value, legislation is one of the most dangerous things that can collapse the crypto market. #IMHO once Uncle Sam or any powerful govt. is swayed enough to universally criminalize crypto transactions, all of those investors and more are screwed.

1025 2018-01-04 22:40:14 @Jordet your Elite Man podacst was one of my favorites on #Crypto. Have you done any other podcasts or videos? Thanks!
1026 2018-01-04 22:40:14 Woman rule crypto

They give the man the ok to continue in the cryptospace

Woman will make the marketcap go over 1 trillion 

After all the men that make all this money have to spend it on someone

Hence y woman run crypto

Please don't forget to set a stop-loss. BTC could change all the plans...
1033 2018-01-04 22:39:44 RIPPLE - Crypto? XRP? Ripple is more of a secure and very speedy payment platform that can process a transaction between Banks in 4 seconds vs others methods take over an hour or 2 to 3 days.XRP as a Crypto?? But Payment System Speed/Secure/lower costs.
1034 2018-01-04 22:39:38 Yeah, I honestly just don't get it. Bitcoin maximalists, ETH fans and crypto anarchists are crippling mainstream adoption of crypto with all the vitriol. This isn't Highlander-- there can be more than one.
1035 2018-01-04 22:39:35 do you ever listen to too many crypto podcasts that you need to pause and speak out loud to yourself in order to hear a female’s voice? it just happened to me

1042 2018-01-04 22:39:09 what do you mean. It's easier to buy something with crypto than use gold.
1043 2018-01-04 22:39:04 Blockchainウォレットの便利なところはクラウドだったこと。
同じBTC財布をiPadからでもパソコンからでも見られました。
しかし，復元フレーズを使えば，どのウォレットでも（例えばcopayでも）同じことができました。
考えれば当たり前のことですが，実際にできて嬉しい
1044 2018-01-04 22:38:57 with crypto it is possible the banking system will simply get an upgrade. There is no longer any need for fractional reserver banking when you use a system that mitigates the problem of double spending + the ledger is public.

1046 2018-01-04 22:38:48 Awesome thanks @parabolictrav - I'm knowledgeable in crypto, not trading, so keeping an eye out for these things you've said to watch for is great, very educational. $xrp , $bch are not the public face of crypto that we should have, so was waiting on that long wick!
1047 2018-01-04 22:38:44 "wtf bruh" pattern is the best.
1048 2018-01-04 22:38:42 @justinvendetta worked flat out over Christmas and New year just shows how much work he has done. No doubt when coding is complete he will be pushing Verge like he was back at the start of December.
1049 2018-01-04 22:38:38 I can make a Steem article about it ^_^

1052 2018-01-04 22:38:27 We need more cutting edge crypto apps and websites! Most have bad design, UX, or are unreliable.

1054 2018-01-04 22:38:21 If gold starts to break past technical resistance and strong fundamentals, that will shoot silver into the $20's easily -- get some crypto profits converting into it too. Banks also have a very nice low COT short position now. Conditions are looking more & more favorable
1055 2018-01-04 22:38:17 Point well said
1056 2018-01-04 22:38:16 So is $xrp not goin on #coinbase ??
1057 2018-01-04 22:37:59 Then just SELL your position @gm11041 and you wont have to worry about any of this! Simple. Justin is NOT a CEO from a normal company like JP Morgan, he writes CODE thats it. If u want shareholder meetings and Wall st stuff then this crypto market is not for you.
1058 2018-01-04 22:37:52 I'm old but talk crypto. Young at heart...
1059 2018-01-04 22:37:50 I am a business vendor that would like to accept Verge for transactions,
Can you please advise me how to go about doing this..ps i am fairly new to crypto but believe in Verge and help would be appreciated greatly.

1064 2018-01-04 22:37:45 Take a deep breath, #xrp #ripple about to take a dive again, whales who didn't sell after #coinbase confirmation of no new crypto to be added will be unloading soon!

1066 2018-01-04 22:37:38 You will have to decide a buy time for yourself after researching. I am happy to let people know about an unknown coin I see potential in but it is up to you if and when to pull the trigger

1075 2018-01-04 22:37:02 @NitfortheMONEY Hi, I love your informative videos as they are filled with great content. As a newbie to crypto, I have been watching your videos daily and they have helped me a lot. What are your thoughts on Dent coin? Could you do a short review on this? Keep up the great work!
1076 2018-01-04 22:37:02 Crypto
1077 2018-01-04 22:37:02 2018 is going be the cryptoyear. Currencies we will have too much, but tokens for great concepts will always win.
1078 2018-01-04 22:36:59 You just trade crypto? Not invest?
1079 2018-01-04 22:36:52 I bet Jamie Dimon has missed many meetings in his time. The fact that Jamie Dimon is at the top means he probably has very little else to do with his time and the company runs itself. When laying the foundations for anything like this will not offer much free time.
1080 2018-01-04 22:36:44 @bitsane_com hey there. I noticed that when I click balances, it won't generate a wallet for me to transfer crypto (BTC) from Coinbase. Any solution?

1084 2018-01-04 22:36:33 Media recognition is a powerful thing. I bet if a person were to name another crypto other than btc it would be ripple. Hard to invest in something you've never heard about.

1088 2018-01-04 22:36:04 Loads of people have debated Spencer already.
Loads of people have debunked everything he stands for.
Loads of people have blown the whistle on his crypto extremist leanings that he usually pretends not to support.
It hasn't changed shit
He needs to be opposed, not conversed with
1089 2018-01-04 22:35:59 calling LeftComs crypto fash is the best thing I've seen on Twitter today. love online.
1090 2018-01-04 22:35:52 Don’t get me wrong...I think @justinvendetta is brilliant but needs PR
1091 2018-01-04 22:35:50 What would you consider "longterm" holder in the fast moving crypto world?
1092 2018-01-04 22:35:49 Obviously he means $XRP
1093 2018-01-04 22:35:49 @CNBCFastMoney Thabk you for that amazing Crypto segment!  We are heading to the  after that!
1094 2018-01-04 22:35:39 The first statement of your article is misleading. They didn't say they would not, they said no decision has been made as of this date...

1098 2018-01-04 22:35:06 Crypto is easier to transact with which makes it significant
1099 2018-01-04 22:34:59 How are you trading in crypto currency in the GCC? I’ve been researching for over a week now and still facing difficulty. Can you please DM me
1100 2018-01-04 22:34:56 What are you talking about then?  Semantics of “making money”?

If someone has profited 20x in crypto but have not cashed out they haven’t actually “made” anything if the next day crypto crashes to 0 with an exchange and liquidity freeze.  That won’t happen with actual USD, ever
1101 2018-01-04 22:34:44 The long term business case for #XRP is .... drum-roll .... None. A central bank backed crypto would completely eliminate XRP's usefulness. The idea of banks using XRP as a reserve currency is ludicrous.

1113 2018-01-04 22:33:59 Great show again tonight. When most finance shows are still laughing at crypto your show is explaining it. Thank you @MelissaLeeCNBC
1114 2018-01-04 22:33:56 Litecoin could be the best crypto IMO but why doesn’t it move up anymore??

1117 2018-01-04 22:33:48 gold only has value because Its common enough to be common and rare enough and people perceive it as valuable crypto currency works the same way, and if used properly it you avoid avoid taxation which will starve the state of taxes making the environment more controllable by pepl

1127 2018-01-04 22:32:58 To be honest, can somebody tell me advantage of using eToro? I know few why not!
First, you do not own coins!
2nd not participating in real coins, you don't affect price, entering into real crypto world will increase demand, so just to switch you increase price!
3rd not for coins

1129 2018-01-04 22:32:55 I don’t have a problem with people being excited about XRP I just don’t get it personally. It seems too integrated with the existing systems that crypto was invented to destroy. As for the XRP token it doesn’t seemto be required to operate the network, feels like a dodgy ICO
1130 2018-01-04 22:32:51 Verge lost me over $2000 profit was still in the green though in the end thats the beauty of crypto

1133 2018-01-04 22:32:37 Hey new crypto people, if you cant make a bittrex or binance account hop onto Hitbtc. Some hidden gems like #HiveProject $hvn are worth looking in to.

1160 2018-01-04 22:30:49 @Altcoinbuzzio Hi ALTCoin Buzz, I love your videos, find them very informative, they're filled with great content on all thing's crypto! I'm a newbie to the crypto world so learning along the way. What are your thoughts on Dent? Can you do a review on it please.
1161 2018-01-04 22:30:48 @crypto_sarah9 do you have or do you know any HashFlare discount code? thanks
1162 2018-01-04 22:30:44 Ripple will help with adoption, but the main goal of crypto eventually is that we don't need banks anymore. Decentralization is vital.
1163 2018-01-04 22:30:39 That's different man. Crypto is a worldwide thing. I get the point but I don't see that happening.
1164 2018-01-04 22:30:35 Unless you have a degree in economics, you aren’t a crypto “expert”
1165 2018-01-04 22:30:33 any crypto currency *on an exchange* can be frozen.  I agree, but asking an exchange to freeze something isn't damning at all.
1166 2018-01-04 22:30:28 Eca? Whatthefuck. Ripple.

1189 2018-01-04 22:28:30 There is no need to be sexist, just because a human has tits, a round ass or some makeup on doesn't mean her brain is qualified to run a centralized token or market a Bitcoin wallet.
1190 2018-01-04 22:28:27 And of course it would pair nicely with a truly constant-time coprocessor for crypto and other similar purposes, with zero fancy features and just raw 1:1 execution of instructions, with explicit caches too

1205 2018-01-04 22:27:04 Interesting. Not trolling. Serious question as I am also in crypto. Are these exchanges made through a medium? (Like an app?) or is it more like “buy me a tv with cash and I’ll gove you bitcoin”?
1206 2018-01-04 22:26:55 Yup! Good call! Becoming harder and harder to trust anyone in the crypto ecosystem - even on something like price! Remember to do your own research on anything & everything!
1207 2018-01-04 22:26:55 The ''time capsule'' from Cryptoyonics help the owner to respect his long-term investment plan and to secure from any temptation or premature transaction a partial or complete liquidation of his crypto wallet. More to come!!

1218 2018-01-04 22:25:56 Ripple is the best business out of all crypto. It will keep going. Hasn’t even made the partnership announcements yet. Which in my opinion is more important than coinbase.
1219 2018-01-04 22:25:53 Same for me. You can here the belief and the knowledge he has when you here him talk. If it was any kind of debate with any other crypto founder he would leave them cowering under the table, as seen in his interview with the #PivX guy.
1220 2018-01-04 22:25:52 People need to start realizing that your choices of investments in the crypto world will dictate the future of our technology.

1226 2018-01-04 22:25:36 Currencies like Ripple are already semi centralized and controlled. If a mass regulation on crypto happens, the currencies that are semi controlled now, and that are still successful (like ripple), will be the target of most people.

1230 2018-01-04 22:25:22 This small market correction is needed. That a good sign of a healthy market. Still think #crypto will probably crash sometime this year or next year, and only the best coins will survive. That will include #stellar
1231 2018-01-04 22:25:19 Crypto can be manipulated because computer programs by it very nature have backdoors.  It's just a computer code.  Everything can be hacked right?

1235 2018-01-04 22:25:14 In specualtion, things get overvalued and undervalued simply because the utility and scarcity hasn't had time to be determined.  This is crypto right now.
1236 2018-01-04 22:25:13 Yes over time, it's designed that way
1237 2018-01-04 22:25:12 You need to let the crypto world know if any of the decision makers are invested in any of the listed currencies to avoid conflicts of interests.
1238 2018-01-04 22:25:09 especially if you bought under $100....

1242 2018-01-04 22:24:55 Weird because every other person in the crypto Community says to open a wallet because the exchanges are not saved and have been hacked repeatedly.
1243 2018-01-04 22:24:53 That’s actually a pretty ignorant comment, I like all the positive news you tweet about ripple but if your going to bring emotion and childish behavior into the scene I’m not interested.
1244 2018-01-04 22:24:42 I'm giving myself three months to be somewhere better. I need more time to research crypto at work. lol

1248 2018-01-04 22:24:35 Exactly, same thing I said months ago. @coinbase wants large institutional investors. Unless they want to anger a majority of institutional investors who are demanding Ripple, they need to add it.

1252 2018-01-04 22:24:24 The #ripoff coin. Ripple should even share a common spot with crypto like #BTC #LTC and #eth.

1254 2018-01-04 22:24:21 Not that I am any expert, but governance (especially UK) is going to come into full effect. For me xrp is the perfect balance of investing in the crypto world, with the security of knowing your pants (crypto assets) won't be pulled down and frozen.

I'd much rather short that. Also I wouldn't dismiss the sec lending, went from 0 to 120 bn inventory in no time

1311 2018-01-04 22:20:34 Of course there is the first mover advantage  stunts like this just make bcash dig it's own grave, it's fun watching crypto noobs think it's the next big thing - it's just a stopped down ripoff of #litecoin, at least $LTC didn't go for stolen valour route
1312 2018-01-04 22:20:28 @makinvestment umarım kendini bilmez boş bogazlarin cümleleri sizi kırmıyordur. Maalesef bizler toplum olarak hala baya gerideyiz. Allah yardımcınız olsun insanla uğraşmak zordur 
1313 2018-01-04 22:20:17 Hahah, that's not what I meant but yeah she's good looking. ^^
1314 2018-01-04 22:20:14 Bittrex de 61 den aldım burda yürümüyor meret
1315 2018-01-04 22:20:13 Awesome he's pretty accurate so i think it will. I'm going to stay tuned to this.
1316 2018-01-04 22:20:09 The daily aesthetic 

You already know brother
1317 2018-01-04 22:20:09 money baby, I have no fucking clue what you can do with crypto but earned a lot of money last few day doing it since 23 dec lol
1318 2018-01-04 22:20:07 Guess we should buy crypto with utility and not just a currency to be safe!
1319 2018-01-04 22:20:07 Tell him to call us

1321 2018-01-04 22:20:04 I have a question about the wallet.  I downloaded the 64 bit Windows and am syncing it up.  I encrypted the wallet and backed it up.  I seen that it can have a different address every time I send coins to it?  Will it go in the same wallet?
1322 2018-01-04 22:20:01 Curious what your common/crypto column headings are.
1323 2018-01-04 22:19:55 This is great for $pot $cann $thc $dope .. using decentralized platforms that are out of government control means these coins should go Lambo.. Well done US government, playing right in to the hands of Crypto :) stop complaining people, just buy.. This is what crypto is for
1324 2018-01-04 22:19:54 Wait until XRP hits $8. Also Tron I don't see going much higher than .30. too many coins in circulation.
1325 2018-01-04 22:19:51 Few of them already in the portfolio. Bullish on Ven and Dragon too.
1326 2018-01-04 22:19:36 @EasyATC  CRYPTO WAY!

1329 2018-01-04 22:19:28 I truly love, the hope and faith the crypto community has for bringing change into the world. I just can't see how naive someone can be to think that a monetary system you can't touch could be the end all be all.
1330 2018-01-04 22:19:18 Hee I quite like him a lot ! Should I add Tron as a payment in Kawaii Crypto too??

1334 2018-01-04 22:19:01 Yes your comment is thanks!
1335 2018-01-04 22:18:57 Me neither :(
1336 2018-01-04 22:18:54 Can you please let us know what action has been taken, we will feel more confident!
1337 2018-01-04 22:18:53 Blockflio suks! they dont have @CryptoBridge
1338 2018-01-04 22:18:37 If everybody was as patient with #BittrexExchange as they allready are with crypto's then the most of those messages below me are nothing. I only can say thanks for the update and keep up the good work!
1339 2018-01-04 22:18:35 You are either with the banks or against the banks.  XRP = NOT CRYPTO
1340 2018-01-04 22:18:32 It's nice to see real world numbers on where the different technologies stand. Real crypto coins are not made up of vaporware.
1341 2018-01-04 22:18:29 Seeing how Facebook does everything else too, we can probably expect a fbcoin or something, later in 2018.
1342 2018-01-04 22:18:23 They are on fire indeed!
1343 2018-01-04 22:18:19 All of crypto is a bet. Some are betting that a company with a strategy will be able to effectively deploy an open asset to solve a real problem.

1347 2018-01-04 22:18:10  Patience my friend. ETC had to make the foundation secure 1st - then safe for dApp devs to create and users to use. Ethereum has major public flaws that lead to major token losses. ETC fixes these problems so apps like Parity don’t have to perish -btw @OriginalMyCom uses ETC
1348 2018-01-04 22:18:08 So the man who has acquired citizenship and a bolthole in NZ in the event of a global crisis/ world war has now amassed millions in a highly mobile crypto currency..... Feel Good everyone?

1351 2018-01-04 22:17:56 Crypto traders have shown huge demand for a stable coin where they can park their funds in between trades. Mainly they use Tether/USDT, which is, unfortunately, an obvious ponzi scheme. Someone should do a legit one.

1353 2018-01-04 22:17:44 And its beginning to rally again, xrp is the shitlord of crypto
1354 2018-01-04 22:17:39 4th #crypto pick of the month is #AION  It is a third generation #blockchain which means it’s goal is to provide federation, scalability and interoperability between different blockchains to communicate.  #alts #btc
1355 2018-01-04 22:17:34 @mfdoomcrypto  the world of crypto goers are very naive to the fact that anything that comes in the arena of the world wasnt already chosen to be there.
1356 2018-01-04 22:17:25 XRP has fiat onboarding, mainstream attention, traditional market support & traditional high market sentiment, complete opposite of crypto. XRP isnt marketed for us, it’s marketed for your parents. Cheap tech stock. It’s not gonna act like a coin but a stock that people hold. 
1357 2018-01-04 22:17:14 #Crypto is almost unfair. Except they're doing it to themselves
1358 2018-01-04 22:17:07 To the best of my ability to calculate MV=PQ (maybe you have a better way), the implied price of Ether is 0. That cannot be the case because despite the speculative component, Ethereum has fundamental utility. What crypto does the velocity eqn correctly price, even relatively?
1359 2018-01-04 22:17:07 I understand that hate for Bryce xD
1360 2018-01-04 22:17:07 If you are making #500,1k or less per day then you can invest in Crypto. #smallplayerscanplay
1361 2018-01-04 22:17:06 I will continue buying ZRX and KNC all year long. What do you think of the idea of putting a % of all trade profits aside for these 2? I have zero urge to sell. These are undercover goats.
1362 2018-01-04 22:16:58 PERFECT!
1363 2018-01-04 22:16:56 Have to start doing it a bit at a time...if you can’t do it now no way you’ll do It down the road. Start now.
1364 2018-01-04 22:16:49 Everybody is spreading FUD about how ripple is not a real cryptocurrency and how it doesn't work etc, but hey, do you realise how broken is Bitcoin? Slow transactions, high fees, and even so it's trading at 15,000 dollars. At least ripple has a purpose. #ripple #bitcoin #crypto
1365 2018-01-04 22:16:47 That, I strongly agree with.
1366 2018-01-04 22:16:35 What’s your process when you choose which crypto tattoo your gonna get next like for example I always first coin to make me a millionaire will be the first coin I get tatted
1367 2018-01-04 22:16:34 Again I have to say if The US govt is trying to come up with a crypto coin no way am I investing that...would you truly trust the “ebb and flow” of it? #NO ..heavily influenced by banks
1368 2018-01-04 22:16:30 Mining cryptocurrencies is becoming a systematic process and it’s a very interesting phenomena to witness.

1369 2018-01-04 22:16:29 #DGB is definitely one of my favorite coins!  I hate when trolls talk down on a coin and talk about how it's going to be worth nothing.  It's like, if you have a crystal ball, why waste your time tweeting and telling a community that the coin they support is bad. DGB to the Moon
1370 2018-01-04 22:16:29 Wow. Thank you.  See you in there!
1371 2018-01-04 22:16:23 The Crypto Market has gone wild in 2017, wish 2018 goes more profitable with all success for everyone. thank @47foundation for sharing this great news
1372 2018-01-04 22:16:19 Seems like every State in US compete  for attention. We had schools closed due to snow in PA and DE while friends in SFO were woken up by the earthquake.
1373 2018-01-04 22:16:12 I just read “herocoins UI” and thought, wow, yet another crypto currency
1374 2018-01-04 22:16:09 My biggest tip for new crypto traders:

The market is super volatile and prices will fluctuate like crazy some days, but no matter what DO NOT panic sell on dips. That’s the number one way to lose your investment and it makes it harder for everyone to make money. Be patient. $TRX
1375 2018-01-04 22:16:04 If the whale had been gone earlier there would have been less people selling. This thing would have grown quick. Instead, that douchebag caused us to all loose some money.
1376 2018-01-04 22:16:01 uh ohhhh, @CryptousClay wasnt this your bae?              $Crypto baby.
1377 2018-01-04 22:16:01 Although, since Crypto kitties and dogs are taken, I’m gonna start crypto hamsters, hedgehogs, and lemurs.  Looking for developers to start new offering with starting price of ten cents. Must finish before tomorrow when they figure out low price isn’t everything!
1378 2018-01-04 22:16:01 If you don't buy $XRP then you're doing it right
$btc $eth $crypto
1379 2018-01-04 22:16:00 The real winners will skirt the correction and navigate a multi-month long bear market and triumph as the blood bath ensues. Capital preservation, risk management and strategic planning is a must in these manic times.

1380 2018-01-04 22:15:59 Many people hate $xrp but I think it will bring new money and awareness of crypto to conventional investor

1382 2018-01-04 22:15:57 I really don't understand that crypto thing too bro.  Can u explain ti me please??
1383 2018-01-04 22:15:56 Usually good indicator of where the price will go in a bull run is the RSI at under 20 and pinching on the 1hr scale. #Digibyte

1388 2018-01-04 22:15:33 
1389 2018-01-04 22:15:16 People who don't own ripple want to see it crash! They don't care about centralized or decentralized currency! They just have extreme FOMO and would rather the whole crypto currency space implode then seeing other's make money! Let's just be happy we are making extra doe!!!

1420 2018-01-04 22:13:04 Certainly the work of Castronova and others taught us that economies are economies, regardless of setting; distorted by circumstance, yes, but still substantially similar.
1421 2018-01-04 22:12:58 How can a crypto currency, or any other currency for that matter, have a chief executive officer?
1422 2018-01-04 22:12:54 Here I am again, eating up all your hilarious tweets. What’s wrong w/ me? Oh yeah, crypto IS my job so I’m shitposting on Twitter and reading all your words.. good lord..
1423 2018-01-04 22:12:54 You’re assuming the speculative component is going to 0. That’s not unreasonable to examine a long-term theoretical outcome, but it’s not a reasonable assumption in practice. Speculation is not going to 0. It’s far from 0 in high-volume public equity markets, much less in crypto.

1431 2018-01-04 22:12:19 Crypto Daily just pointed out that price for coins based under $1 going crazy. What happens when newbies find out they have no use, no market, and no relationships?  Buying on price alone is not usually a good strategy.

1458 2018-01-04 22:10:13 OK then. I guess I'll just keep waiting until somebody actually figures out something novel to do with these newfound crypto capabilities. Not holding my breath though.
1459 2018-01-04 22:10:13 Another great day in Crypto Currency Land--its real $764B+ marketcap

1466 2018-01-04 22:09:48 The fuck are you talking about. Idk what libertarians you're referring to but Ron Paul  (essentially the only relevant one of the past two decades) has always been against these wars.
1467 2018-01-04 22:09:45 What I'm saying is, does scaling it with such a low $ amount or initial investment make sense still.

1472 2018-01-04 22:09:11 Many people only use crypto currency as an investment rather than as an actual form of currency. After the bitcoin boom many bought it to get money as it was rapidly rising, many are doing it with LTC, XRP and others now as many have seen how bitcoin rose, hoping others will too
1473 2018-01-04 22:09:01 It's not just about throwing picks at them.. It would be about teaching them how to trade successfully on their own ;)
1474 2018-01-04 22:08:59 Nice one I'll keep an eye out. Keep plugging the channel on here and I'm sure the masses will follow!

1479 2018-01-04 22:08:46 and the beauty of @Ripple is that they've already future-proofed themselves by embracing regulatory and compliance requirements.. the more GOVs step in to regulate other less aligned cryptos, the easier, faster and cheaper adoption of what #Ripple has to offer becomes.. #XRP
1480 2018-01-04 22:08:45 Exactly. Lots of money to be made by identifying the bottlenecks and inefficiencies in crypto. Won't always be like this.
1481 2018-01-04 22:08:40 $Crypto market cap in a violent parabolic rise, Binance lagging, shitcoins going 200% in half an hour and consistently staying there for days... This is full-blown textbook mania. I don't even want to imagine the blood bath when people start liquidating their monstruous profits.

1483 2018-01-04 22:08:40 Ich investier direkt crypto currency
1484 2018-01-04 22:08:37 Y las denominadas crypto monedas, no lo son, definen su valor en monedas de curso legal, fiat money, que a su vez pierden valor día a día. El dólar ha perdido el 98% desde que fue creado. El resto de las monedas, para que te digo.
1485 2018-01-04 22:08:37 Yeah that too. I suspect Intel’s recent snafu may bring alternative processing tech back to the forefront. Crypto, firewalls embedded in smart NICs, ARM, AMD, OpenPOWER.

1489 2018-01-04 22:08:22 #spectreattack, #meltdownattack: In you invest in #crypto, remember that the exchange holding the private keys on your behalf are most likely running on a cloud service. These 2 attacks enable an intruder to capture private keys, meaning all your coins gone. Time for a HW wallet.
1490 2018-01-04 22:08:19 Every day, a new crypto currency is the hot thing. Scarcity - they keep using that word, I do not think it means what they think it means.
1491 2018-01-04 22:08:17 Hell yeah for $ETH and $OMG both are going to do great

1499 2018-01-04 22:07:35 Thanks dude, yeah I took all my cash out of Coinbase and put it in Binance at start of month. Best decision I made (hopefully), all the best for your crypto adventure in 2018!

1505 2018-01-04 22:07:15 It takes a week to withdraw from @eToro. The irony of not using a crypto currency network @Ripple to move money.
1506 2018-01-04 22:07:09 The amount of negative/fake press towards @Ripple and #xrp is pretty unbelievable and funny the timing, considering that #xrp was on a scorching bull run. Just #HODL and stock up on the dips. #fakenews #hatersgonnahate #cryptocurrency #TheRippleEffect

1511 2018-01-04 22:06:54 If your BTC balance is going down and your USD balance is going up, you might want to consider reevaluating your strategy because you're losing money.
1512 2018-01-04 22:06:53 Speculation is fun when it comes to crypto. What if this and that happens... just read a rumor(dont believe this but) that there could be masternodes for btcp! What inpact would that have for $zcl and $btcp? (Just speculation not anything else so please dont hate on it) discuss.
1513 2018-01-04 22:06:52 Remember that when a bubble pops, no one sees it coming. The crash occurs suddenly when mania is at its highest - when sentiment is *most* optimistic and forward-looking. Not saying this will happen soon, but definitely good to keep in mind. #crypto

1597 2018-01-04 22:01:50 Any ETA on the dcn wallet maintenance???
1598 2018-01-04 22:01:49 THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BITCOIN CORE!
1599 2018-01-04 22:01:49 reported as hacked.
1600 2018-01-04 22:01:39 Retweeted Litecoin LTC (@RipplesCoin):

Litecoin to the moon? 
#litecoin #bitcoin #btc #xpr #ripple #crypto #verge #xvg #ltctothemoon
1601 2018-01-04 22:01:35 you clearly have no idea for the purpose of cryptocurrency, SAD... just really SAD

xrp is not crypto
1602 2018-01-04 22:01:35 see any other charts that tell a similar upcoming breakout?
1603 2018-01-04 22:01:29 $BTC to $7000 within 2 months?
1604 2018-01-04 22:01:19 CRYPTO WINE 
1605 2018-01-04 22:01:16 Crypto was fun when geeks played it, now it’s a gambling and wagering gig.
1606 2018-01-04 22:01:15 You are contributing to the spread of FUD saying that #Coinbase is adding #xrp . There has not been nor has there ever been a statement from coinbase that they are going to be adding #ripple , #followme for current and accurate #crypto information
1607 2018-01-04 22:01:14 Lol what did they figure out yet they don’t have enough #bitcoin I want physical delivery of #btc if im using my futures account!
1608 2018-01-04 22:01:13 fck, that makes me worried.. status on the raiblocks page says: StatusReceived, pending deposit to balance. (Make sure wallet is open and all blocks are downloaded)
1609 2018-01-04 22:01:00 long on $LRC thanks @altcointhoreau for the heads up. Should be interesting to see what this puts out. 

$lrc $xrp $dlt $rdd #bitcoin #crypto
1610 2018-01-04 22:00:50 So Coinbase decided not to add any other cryptos to their line up. That's OK though money is to be made with or without #coinbase #crypto #CryptoCurrency
1611 2018-01-04 22:00:49 The gap between Korean & US markets in Crypto Valuation is insane and there's gotta be people getting rich off of it.
1612 2018-01-04 22:00:46 and finally the hidden crypto xtians went to Nagasaki, where they got nuked by USA in 1945
1613 2018-01-04 22:00:46 You might run this by someone on @Tronfoundation team or @justinsuntron ....
1614 2018-01-04 22:00:45 そんなのあるんですか！ｗ
1615 2018-01-04 22:00:39 du coup tu feras plus des call publics? je suivais un peu de loins et voir un peu si tes calls étaient bien, pour l'instant ça avait l'air pas mal mais si faut payer j'en aurais pas du tout les moyens #POOR #RSA4LIFE
1616 2018-01-04 22:00:39 Yeah the millibit is pretty decent, 0.001 is about 2e ^_^.  Honestly I somehow like the idea of converting inflated fiat (big numbers) into a low inflation crypto (small numbers).  Makes ppl appreciate and understand the whole concept of scarcity right?

1627 2018-01-04 21:59:54 After being here a little while, I've come to the conclusion that there's no such thing as reasonable in this market. #cryptocurrency #Crypto
1628 2018-01-04 21:59:48 #cryptocurrency #Crypto #Binance Investing Tip:  See the end in mind before you begin.  Don't just jump into the swamp expecting to climb out without some mud on you.  The strategy is to make sure you gather enough gold before getting out. #money #invest #WallStreet #Coinbase
1629 2018-01-04 21:59:47 That I seriously doubt' My bags are up 59,000% since Jan 1st '17. How did your BTC shitcoin do in the week that you've been in crypto?
1630 2018-01-04 21:59:47 Correct.  The issue is, it's against their own interests to announce ahead of time.  They want all of the price action (i.e. transactions and transaction fees) for themselves, not just the down side of that action.
1631 2018-01-04 21:59:45 I'm kind of joking; living papers have been a dream for awhile. The challenge is credit assignment. Maybe we should launch a crypto token for the tracking of microauthorships, edits, and reviews.
1632 2018-01-04 21:59:44 Founder sold. It's honestly probably a good move in a financial vacuum. But #crypto is a super emotional thing

1634 2018-01-04 21:59:38 $CLOAK looks good for an entry here. Oversold and looking to move back to the low 200k sat range. $crypto
1635 2018-01-04 21:59:34 @BitcoinBravado can you help this fella out? They said that they were finished with PayPal, in sure they accept Crypto. Wait for a response Patrick
1636 2018-01-04 21:59:30 It is a lending platform and allready working. You ask for some $Lend and put an amount of whatever crypto you want to put as a gage
1637 2018-01-04 21:59:26 New to Crypto and love it. Let's make some money $$$$
1638 2018-01-04 21:59:20 You miss 100% of the picks you don’t take #cryptoquote #focus #TakeAction #learn #crypto

1640 2018-01-04 21:59:07 I'm snowed in and bored.... Any of my followers want me to help them get started in crypto hit me up!
1641 2018-01-04 21:59:06 To those saying ripple is digital Fiat, not crypto: first of all, unless you are a dev you were never in this for the technology, period. 

Second: Bitcoin is known to be an oligarchy so "XRP is centralized" is a moot point. A multisig between <10 ppl controls the btc blockchain
1642 2018-01-04 21:59:04 Why can't I add my #GTO #GIFTO to my #coinmarketcap portfolio? Any help #crypto #cryptocurrency
1643 2018-01-04 21:59:00 Not in crypto nor stocks
1644 2018-01-04 21:58:58 So XRP is going to thrive by robbing millions of people out of $60 because they're unaware of this rule since NO OTHER CRYPTO HAS THIS RULE..

1652 2018-01-04 21:58:38 thanks!
1653 2018-01-04 21:58:30 I think we are on the same page then. :) As I said in another thread here, I am a believer in its potential, but it just isn't a cure-all.
1654 2018-01-04 21:58:25 I’m going in on BURST & holding #Crypto #Burstcoin
1655 2018-01-04 21:58:17 Issues with their mail provider, currently being worked on
1656 2018-01-04 21:58:13 We get it you’re a big crypto guy
1657 2018-01-04 21:58:11 It's only working for some accounts. Some people have played the URL which makes it easier for all.
1658 2018-01-04 21:58:08 Following the denial of $xrp #xrp #ripple being added to @coinbase expect to see a price drop in the next few hours. $xlm is looking like a good buy to transition your gains into today. #cryptocurrency #Crypto #news
1659 2018-01-04 21:58:07 @crypto_rand ‘ın analizi bu “yalan söylüyorsun yalan...” 
1660 2018-01-04 21:58:04 Welcome back, missed your thoughts and comments on this crypto thing.
1661 2018-01-04 21:58:02 $elf !!
1662 2018-01-04 21:57:56 It’s hacked see Charlie tweet
1663 2018-01-04 21:57:54 XRP teased us like the crypto market was a strip club.. Going back up..
1664 2018-01-04 21:57:53 Lmao I just got on here to ask you if your in crypto yet
1665 2018-01-04 21:57:47 Very early to be investing in crypto.
1666 2018-01-04 21:57:44 The crypto space will be regulated. It’s a socioeconomic certainty. Decentralised or not, sadly you’ll never be able to buy a coffee or catch a cab with bitcoin. It’s not a currency.  Never will be. Governments always win. Get out whilst you still can buddy! #xrp #ripple 
1667 2018-01-04 21:57:40 Coinbase or not, honeybadger doesn't care $xrp
Maybe they could lower their outrageous fees first instead of literally robbing people trying to get into crypto lol.
1668 2018-01-04 21:57:36 Just because their CEO says there has been no decision to add new coin does not mean that @Ripple or any other #crypto will not be added. In addition, we don’t need Coinbase for success thanks #korea But feel free to feel #fud and #sell @bgarlinghouse @coinbase #xrp #ripple
1669 2018-01-04 21:57:30 Picked up other #crypto but my #ltc are staying put
1670 2018-01-04 21:57:29 Who has some knowledge on Crypto and wants to get added to my CRYPTO/SNEAKER GROUP??
1671 2018-01-04 21:57:25 Gold.
1672 2018-01-04 21:57:22 I’m going to start a crypto coin give away as I bagged that many times . Rt and follow and I will transfer 1 $mars coin to the random winner. Current $mars price per coin is 1.76p. Don’t all rush at once
1673 2018-01-04 21:57:18 The thing is, your crypto assets ARE in question. All cryptos are in question because the entire market is based on speculation.
1674 2018-01-04 21:57:03 Isn't that a good summary of crypto?
1675 2018-01-04 21:56:55 Hello, the crypto can be used at checkout using ShapeShift. °SM
1676 2018-01-04 21:56:54 I use Binance, Cryptopia and Kraken to transfer fiat because I'm in the UK
1677 2018-01-04 21:56:53 Quick! Change the subject to crypto and don't acknowledge another terrible day!
1678 2018-01-04 21:56:52 Voluntariness does nothing much to mitigate the nature of influence between humans. Our LIVES are full of voluntary things, and yet influence keeps mattering. The very fact that crypto currencies keep multiplying is a sign of how much influence actually matters.
1679 2018-01-04 21:56:48 I think I did see a message saying they're experiencing delays in some transactions. I don't think their servers can keep up with the increase of recent crypto investors.
1680 2018-01-04 21:56:45 I spent nearly an ether on those f#$&ing cats. Which means I'll probs spend another on a smart contract pepe
1681 2018-01-04 21:56:43 わかりやすい解説ありがとうございます。
1682 2018-01-04 21:56:31 I had a hole in my life that I didn't even know existed. Turns out #crypto fills it  #cryptocurrency #tron #tronix #trx
1683 2018-01-04 21:56:23 Bitcoin is the most important #invention in the history of the world since the Internet. #bitcoin #crypto
1684 2018-01-04 21:56:19 1) Governments across the globe (China Russia Venezuela...) are looking to implement govt. backed crypto dollar mainly to get around limitations/sanctions/controls imposed on them through the USD standard.....
1685 2018-01-04 21:56:15 آمين
1686 2018-01-04 21:56:10 @CryptoChoe I recently became a fan of your crypto analysis and am trying to learn the ropes myself.  I love all of the advice on the undervalued coins. Is there any way you can give us a list of some OVERvalued coins to steer-clear of?
1687 2018-01-04 21:56:09 Roger probably bought this account from someone else
1688 2018-01-04 21:56:05 I’m not sure why anyone sells any crypto in this current market especially XRP or Cardano. There is almost always considerably growth per month, quarter and year.  Hold for real wealth.
1689 2018-01-04 21:56:00 Riding the Crypto rocket on the #Verge to #Stellar #Tron.. What a ride. Yesterdays 38% gain was wiped out while I slept then back again within an hour    
#XVG #STR #TRX
1690 2018-01-04 21:55:59 What crypto is already panda? Bch?
1691 2018-01-04 21:55:48 The rise of crypto has brought it to the incel masses
1692 2018-01-04 21:55:45 Either way the bounce back was lovely.
1693 2018-01-04 21:55:45 They're extremely helpful to buy in at a lower price, gotta be quick with it though. If you're #hodling I wouldn't even worry about it.
1694 2018-01-04 21:55:41 I agree and if it is clearly stated it's a security then i can see huge potential and if it included the option of both crypto and FIAT then it would open up to a bigger investment market.
1695 2018-01-04 21:55:40 Worst decision of 2017 was moving my funds into @BittrexExchange .... been locked out of my account since November and @BittrexSupport has been absolutely terrible! #crypto #btc #hostage #beware
1696 2018-01-04 21:55:39 I literally had this thought an hour ago about crypto. You sneaky AI.
1697 2018-01-04 21:55:38 僕の近くの方々は、今日明日購入予定みたいです
1698 2018-01-04 21:55:35 Ça peut leur faire que du bien d’ajouter le Ripple..
1699 2018-01-04 21:55:34 At what price? :)
1700 2018-01-04 21:55:32 I wasn't saying crypto was peer to peer. Leave p2p out of it. My original statement was that both suffer from the same blind spot, which is ignoring human  nature
1701 2018-01-04 21:55:31 Use Referral code 15290938 to sign up for Binance and buy and trade cryptos!!! #BTC #cryptocurrency #altcoins #Bittrex #Binance #coinbase #crypto
1702 2018-01-04 21:55:30 @CryptoYoda1338 thanks for the write up on $xrp. I can’t see it not being crypto in the purist sense , I can also see it as an attempt for banks to be in the game , and also for  ppl to jump on the more household names they see involved
1703 2018-01-04 21:55:28 @CryptosR_Us When you say "take out" on your videos what exactly are you doing? I'm new to crypto and any advice on withdrawing at high points would be greatly appreciated!
1704 2018-01-04 21:55:26 How to spot a #crypto #noob. Read all the comments on a coins feed when it is an exchange issue! If you are not happy with the way @BittrexExchange is handling the situation take your business elsewhere. Otherwise shut up and stop complaining.
1705 2018-01-04 21:55:21 Yes, after crypto I started to question everything. Used to easily believe what "experts" say just because they are profs clerics, etc
1706 2018-01-04 21:55:18 Electric blue eyes?
1707 2018-01-04 21:55:08 We wonder what people think of this pole NOW with the recent news? #cryptocurrency #crypto #XRP #Ripple
1708 2018-01-04 21:55:08 You aren't getting it. The fact that total BTC can't increase is the least important or interesting part of crypto. All that you need to do is slice more finely. ("But BTC doesn't let you!" So what, layer a second chain on that serves as proxy for femtosatoshis; this WILL happen)
1709 2018-01-04 21:55:05 Thanks. Bought some anyway. LOL
1710 2018-01-04 21:55:02 Wow, TRON panda is cool too
1711 2018-01-04 21:54:54 facebook gives you 1billion to buy out obsidian. would you take it?
1712 2018-01-04 21:54:45  download coinbase and u can purchase one of 4 crypto currencies on there.
1713 2018-01-04 21:54:32 Recommend me some coins to buy #crypto
1714 2018-01-04 21:54:25 @etoro whats going on? #xrp #etoro #crypto #fail
1715 2018-01-04 21:54:13 Thank you crypto community for making 2018 the best year ever!
1716 2018-01-04 21:54:12 That would be fun and creative. Not a bad idea. Did you hear about Eso's project in bringing back an online game he likes, through a private server? And getting in-game items via purchase of crypto currency?
1717 2018-01-04 21:54:12 Here's a crazy challenge: Stop saying crypto 
1718 2018-01-04 21:54:10 Couldn't make it today boys

1722 2018-01-04 21:54:04 Siacoin is a beast. Cela ne dit pas grand chose sur le prix, mais c'est un projet qui est très solide et a un bon développement et un bon leadership.

Il fait clairement parti du top 10 des projets crypto-monnaies à suivre.
1723 2018-01-04 21:54:01 yeah im picking up dgb on this dip  selling at 1$ later :D

1730 2018-01-04 21:53:23 Après le scandale qui a eu avec Bcash il sont obligés de laisser un message comme ça avant d’introduire une nouvel crypto
1731 2018-01-04 21:53:14 I've been waiting for an ETH transaction for exactly 12 hours from one wallet to another, what's going on!? 800 block confirmation and counting ...  #bitstamp #eth #Ethereum #cryptocurrency #Crypto #Binance #exchanges
1732 2018-01-04 21:53:05 I didn’t offer you financial advice. I reminded you portfolio gains and realized gains are different. If you are paying for things with crypto those are realized gains when withdrawn from the account. Crypto is like a stock in that regard.
1733 2018-01-04 21:53:04 It seems that Bitcoin calmed down. 
The giant, however, is still sleeping 
Watch the market carefully...
...and remember BTC > BCH

1734 2018-01-04 21:52:53 I wouldn’t believe anything crypto Rachel or crypto Sarah said. Definitely nerdy guys trying to get attention.
1735 2018-01-04 21:52:48 I don't believe the crowd disparaging #XRP is organized enough to collude in a meaningful manner. These are desperate $BTC "crypto-weathermen" whose careers or online following has been built simply by saying "BUY BTC" no matter what the circumstances. Their days are numbered.
1736 2018-01-04 21:52:47 4 month old (one of my motivations for building a long term portfolio) plus crypto = lack of sleep 
1737 2018-01-04 21:52:36 Wouldn't let me login earlier :-/
1738 2018-01-04 21:52:36 What are the chances the government will change the new taxes on crypto currency? 
1739 2018-01-04 21:52:31 Haha!  Try following crypto. It may WAN you off of politics and make you some money.
1740 2018-01-04 21:52:24 I don’t know about any other men but my Value is very high and it’s on the rise kinda like The Crypto market
1741 2018-01-04 21:52:24 Yeah the tiger is cool
1742 2018-01-04 21:52:11 ...I think from now on I'll just buy when you put a little rocket, just to be sure lol. Thanks for $XLM $TRX $XRP and $CND, though
1743 2018-01-04 21:51:55 Someone asked me where to buy #Ripple $XRP. My answer: "Not up there."
1744 2018-01-04 21:51:53 たしかに！
1745 2018-01-04 21:51:48 Hmm what would #Apple do if in app purchases were with #crypto instead of cash.... That could be one way around the % they take. Thoughts? @reddcoin @paccoin_net @Tronfoundation #cryptocurrency #Bitcoin #trx #tron #Reddcoin 

Sounds like something android would do.....
1746 2018-01-04 21:51:41 Funny to watch @CNBC rave about shitty .20% Russell 2000 and DOW .31% returns when we out here in #Crypto making 25% daily on every coin 
1747 2018-01-04 21:51:39 BREAKING NEWS: The Drawing Room is now accepting crypto because TRX made @MattLandsman a billionaire overnight
1748 2018-01-04 21:51:38 This is a difficult problem the crypto/bitcoin/whatever etc 'community' will have to face at some time.... we can't have our cake and eat it unfortunately 
1749 2018-01-04 21:51:22 when and where are they for sale?

1758 2018-01-04 21:50:16 The interesting thing is how disruption will come, from regulators or from the $$ inefficiency of the crypto bubble. don't know who will win the rat race
1759 2018-01-04 21:50:13 I talk a lot of shit about crypto currencies for my internet persona but watching my XRP bought at $0.40 climb to $3.00 in less than a month has been wild
1760 2018-01-04 21:50:09 wow! delta looks nice!
1761 2018-01-04 21:50:05 J'vais doser les crypto dans les mois qui viennent. Faut sauter dans le bateau avant que ce soit plus possible.
1762 2018-01-04 21:50:05 I was in a conversation earlier today and the discussion turned to crypto and if anyone is yet doing a share/ equity token that is just used as raising equity and not a tradeable currency. It's an interesting thought based on a funding token to develop new tech.
1763 2018-01-04 21:50:05 Can u make the eyes bluer? They look greenish...
1764 2018-01-04 21:50:02 Please add crypto’s. Ripple for sure. Thanks
1765 2018-01-04 21:49:59 @etoro - are you guys still down with the login. I was up there but now no longer able to access it. I know you're trying to fix this, but with XRP so up and down right now it would be great to have access to it. Can we set SL on it offline even though all crypto's have -100% SL?

1768 2018-01-04 21:49:39 Ah, that is correct. You meant "that's not how you profit off a bubble." It just depends on how long you've been in and your tolerance for risk. But my joke is, that if @MattLandsman is buying crypto...we might be near the peak :P
1769 2018-01-04 21:49:38 Watching crypto prices
1770 2018-01-04 21:49:36 Hardened crypto OGs probably wouldn't even blink for a 44% one day movement. ;)

1772 2018-01-04 21:49:29 lol risky much? I got in at 0.03 , had i not stalled i coulda got it when it was 0.01 
1773 2018-01-04 21:49:29 Twitter will do nothing to @bitcoin simply because the direction of the account changed.

1774 2018-01-04 21:49:28 crypto-atraente
1775 2018-01-04 21:49:26 I’m still not understanding. Your whole premise is that the system is fucked up. We agree there. But if I needed crypto in the future how will I purchase it?
1776 2018-01-04 21:49:26 I was thinking crypto mining scripts...
1777 2018-01-04 21:49:25 Who is the bank to tell people what they can and cannot buy with their own money?? Outrageous! This is part of the reason crypto exists in the first place. Get out of the way fat bankers, we’re coming for you.

1784 2018-01-04 21:49:01 feels coordinated for sure... multiple media outlets putting out negative pieces on Ripple at the same time as Coinbase press release lol
1785 2018-01-04 21:49:00 Each crypto has a limit supply, but there is no limit in the number of cryptos that can be created, that is why them are fiat.
1786 2018-01-04 21:48:48 Scenario:

-Ripple takes #1 spot from bitcoin in marketcap. 
-Ripple plunges. 
-New investors and some seasoned investors lose there hat.
-Most new and potential investors in the crypto space loose faith in the entire crypto space.
-The rest of the crypto market follows suit.
1787 2018-01-04 21:48:34 Could you give us a couple of headlines on which parts were misinformation? Just a quick knowledge drop? Thanks in advance mate. Love your work.
1788 2018-01-04 21:48:34  Love your transparency.
1789 2018-01-04 21:48:29 Pump and dump is so inappropriate when taken out of context of crypto jargon 
1790 2018-01-04 21:48:28 Newbies buying Ripple is the crypto equivalent of 'no one ever got fired for buying IBM'. 

It allows you to dip your toes in without feeling dumb if it goes to zero. "If it's good enough for Amex, it's good enough for me"

[still a shitcoin]
1791 2018-01-04 21:48:27 I just use 5 diferent crypto coins for transfer. NOTHING is quick like GRS. Wallet is beautiful. Ready for mass adopting.

1793 2018-01-04 21:48:16 It's all about media coverage, and right now the media are sharpening their needles to pop Crypto with these stories about "funding ISIS and North Korea".

1797 2018-01-04 21:47:54 حذر جون مكافي خبير الأمن الالكتروني من التقدم في أساليب الاختراق، وذلك بعد سرقة حسابه الشخصي على تويتر للترويج لعددٍ من العملات الرقمية البديلة في الأسبوع الماضي.

وتمكن المخترقون من الوصول إلى حسابه عن طريق تغيير رقم هاتفه لطلب كلمة مرور جديدة.
1798 2018-01-04 21:47:51 I won't play the anti/pro $xrp game. Instead, outcomes.

Consider... if/when @coinbase (one of the largest $btc exchanges with 4 crypto options) adds $xrp, their clients get an even faster and cheaper method to transfer to other exchanges.

Impact on the broader alt-coin market?

1842 2018-01-04 21:45:16 My point was just that crypto is awesome and cool, but doesn't solve a multitude of social issues that its more breathless adherents think it will. It doesn't fully decentralize trust, because it has connection points to trust-based systems. It addresses falsifiability, but not

Best case: Becomes the worlds global means of exchange - world currency.

Worst case: Governments go DIGITAL (NOT crypto) & bitcoin becomes the best hedge, like gold, due to zero counter party risk (since digitized gold needs trust).

1878 2018-01-04 21:42:22 It's from a twitter account called bitcoin, but compares bitcoin cash with 'Bitcoin core' (misleading term - 'core' is software/repository label and is redundant in this context), and shows a comparison chart that is subjective.
1879 2018-01-04 21:42:22 Are these charts from coinmarketcap?  If not, were can I find them?

1881 2018-01-04 21:42:09 Don't delete your tweet and I'll remind you when it hits this. There's a huge misconception about market caps in crypto. It is a tool yes, but not the be all unit of measure. I'll post more about market caps on my page later..
1882 2018-01-04 21:42:07 I am not sure what you are arguing. None of what you are saying invalidates my points?

There can never be more than 21m by design. But political influence means people have cartels, control exchange points, fork the chain and change the rules, etc.
1883 2018-01-04 21:42:07 you are correct, XVG has the right stuff and would represent a bold move for Coinbase. CB has an even larger responsibility now that joe public is showing up in droves to ensure what ever joe is going to fomo buy is actually legit.

1895 2018-01-04 21:41:10 Randomly stumbled on “banking on bitcoin” on Netflix - v dated but they list Julian Assange as one of the early cypherpunks. No wonder governments don’t like crypto
1896 2018-01-04 21:41:01 - “It’s taxed liked capitol gains”
- “consider making this a business and paying yourself as a trader, apparently the taxes are lesser”

A few messages from your local Facebook Crypto advisor.
1897 2018-01-04 21:40:56 That's great- you're going to need 1000 years for your gold investment to pay off like my crypto has.  Yes, I cashed out plenty of profits and I am now riding on the house. BTW got gold too.

1903 2018-01-04 21:40:20 I wouldn't risk now, it was already a ton of profit
1904 2018-01-04 21:40:12 #Verge is the most private cryptocurrency, more than Monero, Zcash, Pivx. When u use the #XVG wallet through the #WraithProtocol you have the option to make a transaction public or private. the first of its kind in crypto
1905 2018-01-04 21:40:08 Does anyone have the details for a company doing a #Development #Crypto #Token not a #cryptocurrency but more of a series round? To develop systems and programs.

1907 2018-01-04 21:40:01 To be in the crypto space only for the profits, seems like they’ve forgotten or don’t even know why it was created in the first place. Wouldn’t you like to easily, cheaply use a currency you didn’t have to rely on a bank for? At least LTC is on that path.
1908 2018-01-04 21:39:59 Shoutout to @ScruFFuR  for the link crypto just watched my money triple 
1909 2018-01-04 21:39:58 Great trips are made of many footsteps. One of those steps is definitely a big vendor adopting crypto. We have to go that way. The only thing that worries me is, what is Amazon tries Litecoin and dumps it in 6 months ? That would hurt the crypto world very much.
1910 2018-01-04 21:39:45 Dude I got in .06,should I worry?

1912 2018-01-04 21:39:39 Totally misleading. One can make a crypto with 1 trilion coins and sell one for 1 dollar and claim to have 1 trilion market cap.

1927 2018-01-04 21:38:50 Seriously. Maybe you should hire someone and let them invest for you. You can’t always rely on Twitter.
1928 2018-01-04 21:38:44 We'll call that a Ripple soon
1929 2018-01-04 21:38:43 How do you short crypto?
1930 2018-01-04 21:38:42 To put a number on it, anything more than 20% of your total net worth in crypto is probably irresponsible investing.  Never be afraid of taking some winnings off the table and frequently adjust to your risk appetite and age.
1931 2018-01-04 21:38:36 You got me all wrong bro, I’m not straying down that path but for the things we wish to achieve with mainstream adoption we must tick certain boxes

1936 2018-01-04 21:38:15 Crypto currency friends: There's a lot of dumb money moving into Ripple, expecting it to double everyday. These people will panic and cause a selloff when their unrealistic goals don't come true.

Think about cashing out your $XRP profits if you've made good money.
1937 2018-01-04 21:37:58 So...The founder of the crypto currency, Ripple, is worth more than founder of Facebook?

Hmmm...

Good luck with that....

1938 2018-01-04 21:37:51 Here's a thought - what if Spotify added a crypto miner? For your three minutes, you dedicate 10-20% of your spare CPU cycles to mining, which gets sent to the artist directly? (That last bit is probably the tricky bit). No idea how much it'd be worth, mind.

1945 2018-01-04 21:37:17 It saddens me that people don’t understand your reasoning for selling your LTC. You show charts and reasons why you’re doing it and people still can’t get it. They’re all just greedy and not seeing the whole purpose of crypto in the first place. FOR EASE, USAGE, ACCESSIBILITY.

1955 2018-01-04 21:36:36 Further, the game god scenario can't happen, sure. But in the real world, "influence" is actually how everything happens. There aren't any true secure exchanges in RL. And yet influence runs all. What in crypto prevents that from happening? We have political parties within BTC!

1960 2018-01-04 21:36:17 What principle ?
1961 2018-01-04 21:36:11 Do you think it’ll fall below the 30min cloud? Might close just to be safe
1962 2018-01-04 21:36:10 And sorry I meant Don. Dude today I’m so tired. Crypto, baby and biz. Long days and nights.
1963 2018-01-04 21:35:50 It's gonna go nuts. No question. I'm gonna be draggin' my $DRGN ICO bag around for years. Just too much upside to sell.
1964 2018-01-04 21:35:41 Yes, that is exactly my point. Various "crypto-assets" rise and fall, but the foundation will survive. It also reminded me of how Seagate and Western Digital raced each other in HDD development, while Netscape Mafia invented the Cloud (which nobody used back then).
1965 2018-01-04 21:35:35 Nobody knows for sure when it’s going to happen. Everything was great in 2008 as well. Some economists were sounding the alarm bells a few years before that. People are making great returns with crypto currencies. Takes a bit of research and time to get into.
1966 2018-01-04 21:35:35 Any ideas why every crypto exchange are not open accounts until 15th january?
1967 2018-01-04 21:35:33 The voters in our poll yesterday think #Ripple can exceed #Bitcoin market cap if it hits Coinbase. 
What do you think about the people who voted in that poll?
1968 2018-01-04 21:35:26 500k new registered users in #binance in a 30 hour period. Unfortunately those who are new to crypto probably just bought alot of alts during a bullrun and are now calling customer support for a refund.

1971 2018-01-04 21:35:02 Not a red herring. 

Agree total supply of *any given* cryptoc$ can't be increased. But total quantity of crypto has SKYROCKETED, and they all exchange to one another. Instead of one centralized agency increasing supply, anyone can.

2017 2018-01-04 21:31:32 Don't get caught up on one person. We really appreciate what you do and obviously the no1 rule in crypto is DYOR. I don't follow all your calls, I pick and choose the ones I like obviously. Again, thanks for your tips!
2018 2018-01-04 21:31:29 @jaltucher I really enjoyed watching your perspective on crypto.  great big picture perspective.
2019 2018-01-04 21:31:22 nice crypto portfolio. If $DRGN is $20-50 I am an millionair and only have to sell 30%
2020 2018-01-04 21:31:22 So what do you think happens the next two days?  A week in #Crypto is like an eternity.  Feel free to comment some other scenario.

2024 2018-01-04 21:31:11 Indians reading this: Move BTC and alts out of Indian exchanges and into private wallets or invest in hardware like ledger nano s.

Seruously do it.
Noone will be able to touch your crypto.
2025 2018-01-04 21:31:10 and you thought it was crypto finally taking over the world :-)  take care mate
2026 2018-01-04 21:31:09 Coming soon Facebook ICO. If Mark did that it would definitely put cryptos over the trillion $ mark.
2027 2018-01-04 21:31:05 Is there a reason for the majority of crypto products to have their own coin/token? 

Couldn't most have a built in monetary system (like gaming) that you withdrew into BTC as payment?

Are there good examples of alts that benefit from having an actual coin?

2048 2018-01-04 21:29:46 Gold is not legal tender in India as well, but it is traded as people see value in it. This point holds true even for bitcoin.
With the recent raids on Indian crypto exchanges, and multiple warnings from the govt and RBI, I feel a major announcement is approaching.

2081 2018-01-04 21:27:23 How to become a #crypto trader:
1. Visit website: seems legit ?
2. Check team: PhDs & Experts ?
3. Read whitepaper: don’t get it? must be good
4. Check price: low, will certainly go up
5. Buy & hold until profit
7. Call yourself a crypto trader, and share ur investment strategies
2082 2018-01-04 21:27:15 Right it was his sell combined with him tweeting about it and all the new crypto money freaking out and selling.
2083 2018-01-04 21:27:13 I never talked about crypto before in public. Had my Twitter account for years but never posted anything... only used it to follow news, haha

2093 2018-01-04 21:26:06 To all #XRP people: do not respond with hate on their hate #xrpthestandard . To all new XRP holders, do not fall on FUD, we all been there chew it spit it and carry on, because future is great for every crypto that has a clear use case!

2098 2018-01-04 21:25:27 we have extensively covered verge on our channel all week. but we're okay with it just performing well on the markets, i'll consider that as a #vergecurrency reward for all the marketing @JULegacies has done for the company! straight from the dev's :)
@vergecurrency
2099 2018-01-04 21:25:22 That said, it's inaccurate to say that there aren't authorities over a given cryptocurrency. The developers of each one have big power. Forks are forms of influence. Cartels are forms of influence.

2104 2018-01-04 21:25:04 You can't look at the sell volume alone, it's the corresponding self inflicted FUD that comes with the creator of a coin says he sold everything.  Given the "new money" in crypto at that point in time and the fact that people will be people...can't argue that it was a factor
2105 2018-01-04 21:25:00 cryptopia is dope
2106 2018-01-04 21:24:43 @get_delta is great. Personally... I use @altpocket It's not an "app" but the service is so much better than blockfolio imo. I don't know how anyone has the time to manually enter every single trade/transaction in these other apps. altpocket uses API's to import exchange data.

2110 2018-01-04 21:24:14 People need to learn how to interpret what they read. No where does it say, No Ripple or any coin. It says, “we have not made a decision yet.” 
2111 2018-01-04 21:24:13 I am seriously thinking about going. I have been fantasizing about organizing a Ski Summit for crypto for years.
2112 2018-01-04 21:24:07 Time for an episode of #StoriesWithStu A good friend of mine has been fighting the panick trade syndrome, let’s just say he held and reaped massive rewards overnight. The courage and patience is saint like. Learn from his story. STU. #Btc Crypto #StuToshi
2113 2018-01-04 21:23:57 @HowardBroz @Numpteenutz worth a shot 
2114 2018-01-04 21:23:53 I thought that too, but wouldn’t that just be removing it one level? Insider trading could still happen before the announcement. Still, it would be nice for everyone to be ready, rather than everyone scrambling, like with $bch.
2115 2018-01-04 21:23:50 100% agree. I will fix this in next iteration

2122 2018-01-04 21:23:27 It has always worked, someone did a damn good job of perpetuating #FUD all week. We have covered Verge EXTENSIVELY on our channel. We clear up all the #FUD and now are watching all the #FOMO happening with its slow but steady rise. #tothetop10
2123 2018-01-04 21:23:17 @krakenfx I understand that your user base has grown significantly, but please SCALE UP GODDAMMIT! The exchange is literally unusable - you're losing money because people, like me, are moving their #crypto away from the you pretty much anywhere else (trading on Kraken? Haha lol)
2124 2018-01-04 21:23:04 Well said, when I started over a year ago that's a memory I clearly have. There's a feeling that if you're not constantly flipping you're not doing it right.

Now I mostly just hold my accumulation and watch the value rise.
2125 2018-01-04 21:23:00 This project is pleasant in that a platform will be created to work with the crypto currency, where all exchanges will occur only with one coin.#Coinvest #COINToken

2128 2018-01-04 21:22:50 $BTC , Litecoin is just a high cap Alt coin.
2129 2018-01-04 21:22:50 Yes after a day! Use litecoin next time and exchange it on Binance.
2130 2018-01-04 21:22:46 .@Pascalcoin has instant transactions that work today.

Pascalcoin is the superior infinite scalability crypto out of these 3, in my opinion.

2133 2018-01-04 21:22:40 Oh wow, I guess I'm the noob here, I got in at the beginning of 2017, and just went full-time about a month ago.  Did you just start using Twitter? That's crazy you have no followers.  I literally just made an account a few months ago

2155 2018-01-04 21:21:04 $XLM bouncing quite nicely. It was a good shot, after all. #crypto
2156 2018-01-04 21:20:59 wtf do you know? crypto was built by the dark web and the free markets like the silk road, verge is going to take those customers. I’ll put my faith in the drug trade economy and it’s need for anonymous transactions. #vergecoin #xvg $xvg
2157 2018-01-04 21:20:56 LOL
2158 2018-01-04 21:20:54 A lot of hype around using crypto for smart contracts and asset tracking ignores that the really hard problem is - and always will be - in the correspondence between model and reality. You can't dissolve the map/territory distinction by sprinkling moon math on it.
2159 2018-01-04 21:20:52 now yall niggas hop on this crypto shit
2160 2018-01-04 21:20:50 I'd tell you what i bought it at and what I sold it at, but I'm actually way too embarrassed to share.
2161 2018-01-04 21:20:48 Crypto stuff. Not on actual exchanges. The gains are worth the gamble right now.
2162 2018-01-04 21:20:42 Thats funny
2163 2018-01-04 21:20:42 I don't have kids, but imagine that watching them grow up is like when your favourite long-term #crypto pick charts a steady course  Ya?
2164 2018-01-04 21:20:42 No winners or losers here brother, it's in everyone's interest that we get paid fairly for the work we do. Misinformation only serves those that are getting that $$$. Ricky, give us your crypto picks plz, thank u

2169 2018-01-04 21:20:28 Wow nice try to referral jack
2170 2018-01-04 21:20:01 Since $XRP’s focus is primarily international institutions, I’m not sure adding / not adding will have much effect long term. Short term effects could be substantial though.
2171 2018-01-04 21:20:00 I don’t think it’s too late at all. I really think $btcp will be worth it
2172 2018-01-04 21:19:59 2014. You?
2173 2018-01-04 21:19:57 Hocam ben gündüzden panik yapmadan satmistim

2178 2018-01-04 21:19:46 @Breaking_Crypto @tweetretweet @fastrise0783 @officialmcafee look at this
2179 2018-01-04 21:19:44 This is absurd. Right now transfers and some exchanges are so slow that you can't make trades at all at times. $crypto 
2180 2018-01-04 21:19:41 Also hoping $ella will gather some momentum shortly. Especially now I’m loaded up I’d best get checking out your other recommendations
2181 2018-01-04 21:19:40 I have a question in all seriousness. I see the debate abt centralized or decentralized and I don’t get it. What would you buy crypto with if banks were gone?
2182 2018-01-04 21:19:37 @Ksonatos what's your opinion on the SEC and Crypto?
2183 2018-01-04 21:19:30 #NEO  still undervalued compared to some of these massive market caps out there #crypto
2184 2018-01-04 21:19:30 Tron is the cheapest coin at 13 cent in the top 10 coins of the market cap! Personallyi think a correction is coming are that huge push but i also think it will be one of your best investments! #tron #trx #btc #crypto #Cryptocurreny #ripple #bitcoin
2185 2018-01-04 21:19:23 To me #ripple is everything a crypto should not be. This is why i do not invest in it. Yet i wish all ripple owners goodluck
2186 2018-01-04 21:19:19 Plenty of other good pucks out there to 🖒

2204 2018-01-04 21:17:40 When you see a #crypto pioneer like @SatoshiLite downsize his image against a lesser established individual like @justinsuntron is comical to me. Like Bill Gates going against my Geek Squad tech. #TRX is doing something right  #TRON #tronix to the #moon move over #LTC
2205 2018-01-04 21:17:36 Should I be excited, or not? It is the New Year; A time when things from the past often get sorted. So many support issues, with more and more people entering Crypto. Good luck @WEXnz, look forward to @BTCEcom issues getting resolved! #WEXnz
2206 2018-01-04 21:17:33 @chrisrock once joked, “have you ever taken out $300 at 4 o’clock in the morning for something positive?...a psychiatrist should pop up on the screen”. @coinbase, might be an idea for us #crypto junkies 
2207 2018-01-04 21:17:32 #tip #tipthurs
Dont chase! #nofomo. U will panic sell if u chase and buy at the top! #buylowsellhigh means being patient. Take time to recognize the buy and sell patterns. When a #crypto shoots up multiple days in a row u know that it must #dip due to #investors taking #profits.
2208 2018-01-04 21:17:27 As a student, I highly recommend not invest ANY in the crypto market if your life is heavily dependent on your stipend, fellowship, scholarship, family savings, etc. Enjoy the blockchain idea and avoid the speculation.
2209 2018-01-04 21:17:25 どこまでいくでしょうね
2210 2018-01-04 21:17:20 I'd be interested in your thoughts about the rising discussion about XRP @DiaryofaMadeMan? Does it help Crypto or should you stay away because it is the way into the  centralized past?
2211 2018-01-04 21:17:20 So much Fake News on Twitter for #crypto. Do your own research! try the wallets, use the coin, play with the product or service. Then start making claims #btc #xvg #trx
2212 2018-01-04 21:17:18 the whole idea for crypto currencies is to be decentralized - no government and no IRS.   ripple is a bank driven consortium that is going to empower government and IRS to get your money.  BANKS want a piece of the action
2213 2018-01-04 21:17:17 $XVG is a Dogecoin fork.. I think that say it all
2214 2018-01-04 21:17:11 Satoshi and Justin got beef now, the crypto community used to be so supportive

2217 2018-01-04 21:16:54 have you checked the new crypto-commerce platform... buy and sell goods (new and used), and put your cryptos to a good use...
@ravelousmarket you can trade your old stuff for juicy crypto...
2218 2018-01-04 21:16:53 What’s your prediction for Tron? Do you see it following in the footsteps of Ripple?

2223 2018-01-04 21:16:40 maybe you should stop being an idiot and read an verified article before being an idiot and posting idiotic stuff... haha and yet you call me and idiot 
2224 2018-01-04 21:16:36 Why the hell is wrong with you?
2225 2018-01-04 21:16:35 Just curious, what was it?
2226 2018-01-04 21:16:23 There seems to be a lot of garbage tweeting in the crypto world. Tough to sort out what’s legit and not.

2237 2018-01-04 21:16:01 Great info for crypto decoder ring.
2238 2018-01-04 21:16:00 I get to live in what feels like an alternate reality to everyone else I know...as if standard life rules hardly apply to me any more. I've managed to live life mostly by my own rules for years, but I'm embracing it on a new level now. Thanks $crypto
2239 2018-01-04 21:15:56 All for the concept of privacy coins. Just don’t have all of your USD invested in them. Governments hate them. They can regulate against them in a second leaving you with a crypto portfolio worth less than a broom closet. #diversity
2240 2018-01-04 21:15:36 This will be the first time in #crypto history u can pick up something with the #bitcoin name for holding a coin other than $BTC. You get 1:1 for holding $ZCL and the price is less than $100. #BItcoin = 15k. Everyone will #FOMO.  $BTCP > $BCH
2241 2018-01-04 21:15:36 LOL. You small time crypto 'traders' are hilarious. Don't apologize... You don't know what you don't know.
2242 2018-01-04 21:15:31 The NEO uses C# and Java programming language which is one of the contribution factors that makes NEO better than ETH in my opinion.

2250 2018-01-04 21:14:44 Of course crypto had to come in..   So who are the manys that hold it?  What I can see there are few that held it.. and now the many are buying it off them making the few rich..  and the many will be holding the bag in the end..
2251 2018-01-04 21:14:41 @Lukefreemaan you on the crypto train too?
2252 2018-01-04 21:14:39 Shit happens and it's actually quite simple: wait for proof before trumping - aeh - tweeting unless you want to run for the next president of the US of A ;)
2253 2018-01-04 21:14:32 Legit place to buy/sell Crypto? - mine is doing great, but tired of CoinBase
2254 2018-01-04 21:14:31 It didn’t say they weren’t adding new coins it simply said they haven’t made a decision. This is why journalist suck
2255 2018-01-04 21:14:21 Unavailable to buy. Can only deposit/withdraw
2256 2018-01-04 21:14:15 They say its best to write out your goals. My goal for 2018, grow my #crypto assets from $5k to $30k by learning as much as I can and making smart choices. Some may say this is foolish and others may say this is easy, but this is my target.
2257 2018-01-04 21:14:15 If Warren Buffet, among other successful investers, has proven that stock-picking and mutual-funds can not beat the market in the long-term, why would you try? What they suggest investing in is a total stock market index fund. I recommend Vanguard. Or just put it in crypto!
2258 2018-01-04 21:14:13 I Just jumped and started dancing , well back on the couch

2260 2018-01-04 21:14:08 Thanks for info on the acronyms guys, but what does short term mean? A few hours or a day or two? Crypto moves so fast

2262 2018-01-04 21:14:02 Just gained another 11% on $Start since my last tweet a few minutes ago, the FOMO is real, but still REALLY early.
2263 2018-01-04 21:14:00 Got £300 to spare and not invested. Thinking about ADA or TRX. TRX might be the next ripple... insure though.
2264 2018-01-04 21:14:00 Well the smart thing to do, would be to continue to work and do crypto at the same time, instead of waste your free time *not working* trolling others on twitter. But hey me and my 100$ investment prob know nothing right?
2265 2018-01-04 21:13:59 I bet you guys will find a way to fuck up crypto currency
2266 2018-01-04 21:13:58 Please, crypto doesn't mean cryptocurrencies, it means cryptography. In fact, I would argue that cryptocurrencies are crypto at all.

2279 2018-01-04 21:13:11 Я вот тоже думаю про падение на 30%, правда я думала, что это случится после 2,5$

2281 2018-01-04 21:12:59 I have considered a few 400% sells, but having a difficult time even pulling the trigger on those.
2282 2018-01-04 21:12:53 Surely you could have done a bit of research before blindly posting Sarah?
2283 2018-01-04 21:12:44 I agree $VEN is one to hodl, unless you absolutely need to take profits for something, $VEN should pretty much be the last coin to cash out right now.
2284 2018-01-04 21:12:36 Yeah, that's the whole point, BUY the DIP
2285 2018-01-04 21:12:35 You ever try yoga? Night and day difference in how my back feels all day when I spend 10 minutes stretching in the morning
2286 2018-01-04 21:12:35 Because they don't know any better, nor do they read the Terms of Service. Crypto trading is a game defined by exchanges and token developers. They have no liability to redeem any of it.
2287 2018-01-04 21:12:33 Lol it’s not! Crypto- means secret, hidden. Like cryptozoology is secret zoology with Bigfoot and shit. No death yet!

2294 2018-01-04 21:12:03 Everything in crypto world is still if what is wrong with that ? They can’t get to this market cap because of some idiots buying unknown currency
2295 2018-01-04 21:11:59 WHOEVER THINKS THAT FACEBOOK, TWITTER, GOOGLE,.. ARE HUMANS END PRODUCTS IS FUCKING DUMP. BLOCKCHAIN IS HERE TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE 21ST CENTURY! $CRYPTO
2296 2018-01-04 21:11:58 Oh that sucks you always gotta have an exit for good or bad once you make the trade set up. Any reason you think that happened to you?

2307 2018-01-04 21:11:20 In 10-15 years, people will be stocking up on old hard drives hoping to find the mother load of #crypto that the original owner forgot about.  Like a modern day gold rush

2308 2018-01-04 21:11:16 Hi Simon, I like Tron. The price has flown over the last few days. I really like the team and I think it’s a long term play. I would be guessing on short term price as it has increased so much but surely it will continue as this is crypto. I also like Elf.

2312 2018-01-04 21:11:10 @traderogretici pozisyonunuz aynı mi?
2313 2018-01-04 21:11:04 That's funny seeing how coinbase just posted earlier saying they will not be adding any currency to their site.
2314 2018-01-04 21:11:01 It would initially appear that traditional leaders of the financial markets, such as big banks and stock exchanges, are unshakable and invincible... #blockchain #Crypto
2315 2018-01-04 21:11:00 @crypto_sarah9 That would be pretty amazing! Is this info available anywhere online? #xvg
2316 2018-01-04 21:10:58 Huge mistake on my part. Got 100% out WAY too early. As in WAY.  Congrats :)
2317 2018-01-04 21:10:57 Point taken, but in reality tech is rarely well designed or matured before released. This can be catastrophic. Crypto for example. Billions of dollars now being traded inside a ”tech” that all but .000001 of the pop. can’t comprehend let alone understand. Recipe for disaster.
2318 2018-01-04 21:10:57 binance is really sketchy right now....down most of last 8 hours....sighhhh
2319 2018-01-04 21:10:56 $part @ParticlProject top privacy tech, decentralized marketplace coming Q1, way undervalued and somehow under the radar. Should be where $xvg is.

2321 2018-01-04 21:10:46 @ME_Bongers 
2322 2018-01-04 21:10:39 They never mentioned #XRP Exclusively. They just aren't adding any more coins at this time. They have trouble handling 4 cryptos currently #coinbase
2323 2018-01-04 21:10:39 What’s the source?
2324 2018-01-04 21:10:39 source?
2325 2018-01-04 21:10:36 Profit is profit. If it dips further im buying more :)
2326 2018-01-04 21:10:31 They just want to educate the masses?

2337 2018-01-04 21:10:10 I’ve also heard the same thing about Ripple. Are both true?
2338 2018-01-04 21:10:06 I’m loving $ELLA it’s still massively under the radar at 4m.. I really do feel this has 100m mcap in 2018

2344 2018-01-04 21:09:55 @AmitDaryanani Hey! Are you THE Amit Daryanani that collaborated with Mitch Steves on the RBC's Crypto & Blockchain Ecosystem report? If so, is there a way I can get a copy of the report? Strictly for personal use/research. Thanks!
2345 2018-01-04 21:09:54 Hasn’t this already been proven fake??
2346 2018-01-04 21:09:54 Yes, both examples are wrong in today's life. But I would bet significant money (or crypto) that there are countless more examples like mine than yours.
2347 2018-01-04 21:09:53 Crypto currency is just the gold rush with less overalls and more teeth

2351 2018-01-04 21:09:34 Hmmm....Passive investments with a little in commodities, crypto, and marijuana.  No sure about that last one  after today’s AG announcement.
2352 2018-01-04 21:09:34 In the long run, the majority of coins will be profitable, let's just embrace crypto!
2353 2018-01-04 21:09:29 More likely it's not than it is
2354 2018-01-04 21:09:23 We may need to do an updated one then :)
2355 2018-01-04 21:09:20 That’s why you don’t buy into #xrp... you want centralized go to a bank...for decentralized stay on with crypto...don’t help these bankers take over. #Decentralized #trx #tron #bitcoin #litcoin

2370 2018-01-04 21:07:55 @eToro there hasn't been a single day where your site hasn't either : 1/ crashed during a drop in crypto rates 2/ blocked trading during a drop in crypto rates, and 3/ delayed end trade when a crypto is at a sensational peak, only to resume when its dropped. Coincidence much!
2371 2018-01-04 21:07:53 You say that yet all the centralized exchanges lose crypto currency all the time. In PRACTICE trust is all over the place.

2378 2018-01-04 21:07:24 that is why I initially got involved with Crypto. #BITCOIN and #LITECOIN are accepted as payment for Bullion at the best firms and it is discounted if you use Crypto over debit. but then CRYPTO so out performed the bullions that I kept the crypto.

2384 2018-01-04 21:06:59 Y'all.... ED was bad but god DAMN Qryptos is complete and utter GARBAGE. But that's what you gotta do if you wanna get the scoop before the public! Gotta deal with shitty exchanges. Happy I got myself a little bag of $SPHTX

2410 2018-01-04 21:05:31 Don't worry, sounds like we've grown up in the same household. Never said it won't go down, but when it does, BTFD. It's here to stay, even when it tanks because everything has to go down at sometime obvisouly. Also crypto is a whole new game for everyone, that comes w change

2437 2018-01-04 21:03:54 people shorting and longing in crypto is akin to guessing whether or not you'll be going up or down on a roller coaster blindfolded. perhaps you might have a feel as to where you're going but you're really just going to get rekt $XRP
2438 2018-01-04 21:03:50 Do you need to increase or reduce your positions?

2449 2018-01-04 21:02:59 Also don't be confused with traders and investors. If someone claims theyre a trader, chances are they're not because that involves swing trading and so on. Investing is just the process of expending money to receive profits. EXACTLY what everyone is doing with crypto.
2450 2018-01-04 21:02:55 I'm shifting attention to another crypto called "Monero". I'll just keep tabs on it for now, before deciding whether to jump in finally.

2457 2018-01-04 21:02:21 $NVDA will continue to win at the center of crypto and AI. Blockchain assets might be hard to predict due to the ICO craze without any public ownership of the underlying tech company. The public currency is separate from the private business

2459 2018-01-04 21:02:19 And yes, I just invested in fun yesterday. Online gambling industry is huge, and #fun is the next big thing.
2460 2018-01-04 21:02:16 Not everything revolves around market cap! Yeah, it’s a way to analyse assets, but crypto world is highly unpredictable... anything can happen!

2467 2018-01-04 21:02:01 It's necessary a lot to add @Ripple  on @coinbase?? #xrp it's better and during the 2017 had a big evolution, had the better result that other crypto with out support of @coinbase . For my opinion it's no necessary to up #xrp on @coinbase... @haydentiff

2473 2018-01-04 21:01:44 What u think about the Coinbase news of not listing any new crypto
2474 2018-01-04 21:01:37 Just wondering- and would be willing to pay for COINMARKETCAP to remove fake crypto from its site--- umm like RIPPLE to provide a better indicator of the Market Capital in CRYPTO space.

2485 2018-01-04 21:00:49 That’s kind of big crypto news. Thx for sharing.
2486 2018-01-04 21:00:43 For everyone shorting $xrp right now, it's just my opinion, but I don't think that's a very smart move right here, I don't think it's anywhere near done.  I just don't see it.  Although I hate them, I'm still holding 10% of my bag that I sold out of.
2487 2018-01-04 21:00:39 ever get this fixed? I have been waiting a week to get my 2FA disabled due to a new phone...

2503 2018-01-04 20:59:58 Yeah it’s very funny how the BTC purists are the ones bitching about XRP...just like the big banks bad mouth crypto...there is a reason they do this, fear or they missed out on the train and feel stupid so now they whine like children.
2504 2018-01-04 20:59:52 True cryptoman..

2506 2018-01-04 20:59:47 Market manipulation like this is why I fear crypto will not function as a currency in the short term...the tech benefits are obvious but until the FIAT connection is obliterated, valuations are simply gambling

2516 2018-01-04 20:58:50 Obvisouly you aren't that educated on the topic because crypto is just getting started and 2018 has room for massive gains. I just got in and my overall portfolio is up close to 175%. That took months for my stock portfolio to come close to that. Do your research and you'll see.
2517 2018-01-04 20:58:45 Dude DGB is so over looked. Good call
2518 2018-01-04 20:58:41 I am scanning for another great setup like $TIX was.  I do quality over quantity. We find plays before the rest of the sheep and when they chase it we sell to them. Lets go! $btcusd $btc

2528 2018-01-04 20:58:09 2/2 TRX is a great token but I would never, ever sell $ADA to buy in at this price! If I were you and I really wanted to sell ADA I would buy POE/DigiByte/Verge as they have small market caps with bright future. Swap one top10 coin for another is bad idea.
2529 2018-01-04 20:58:09 Why not crypto
2530 2018-01-04 20:58:08 get aids and die
2531 2018-01-04 20:58:08 Nice, its pretty awesome huh?  When did you first go down the rabbit hole?
2532 2018-01-04 20:57:57 Decentralization is a key component to all considerations. As it stands, XRP doesn't stand a chance. 

Furthermore, sans massive coin burn, how high can their market cap actually go? 

I made a nice chunk from it, but I'm putting my profits back into real crypto.
2533 2018-01-04 20:57:56 Is there a running list of cryptos that will be compatible with this?

2538 2018-01-04 20:57:38 Is @Coinbase refusing to add the second largest crypto-currency $XRP because it doesn't precisely meet their arbitrary guidelines? If so your shareholders won't be very impressed... some might even consider a violation of fiduciary duty? Competitor @GetCoinJar is adding $XRP.
2539 2018-01-04 20:57:31 Waiting for these crypto investments to make ya boy rich 
2540 2018-01-04 20:57:28 Hey, how would one go about getting access to the crypto cartel?
2541 2018-01-04 20:57:18 If whoever you work with/for is more interested in frequently checking the latest crypto prices than his actual job, either join him or find a new place to work.
2542 2018-01-04 20:57:18 1) I have no idea if Apple is coming out with a crypto., but right now it's just dollars. 2) The suggestion by author that it is an investment in Apple the company is misleading. 3) Any Apple run crypto is simply NOT bitcoin/decentralized.
2543 2018-01-04 20:57:16 What you have to ask yourself is how many shitcoin offenders can compete is this new theory of fast transactions. 90% will go to zero. 2018 is the year that alts get rekt once and for all.
2544 2018-01-04 20:57:08 I'm more exposed to #alts now than I've been at any point in my #crypto journey. I'm scared to go to sleep...
2545 2018-01-04 20:56:58 Totally depends. If I have a perfect entry and the coin I hold is a longtermhold I don't sell anything on Bitcoinmovements and just hold through. On coins that I ony flip, I might sell some and try to scalp back in, if it pumps through I just put the profits in another coin.
2546 2018-01-04 20:56:56 happy New Years Jon! Helping on a crypto ETF which should track all. Personally I like Ripple and ETH lately but BTC sh bounce
2547 2018-01-04 20:56:49 Who added at 22 Cents? Not me I got in at the lovely before it hit 1 cent mark :). I like to find my coins cheap & hold. I am useless at day trading haha
Look at Tron right now, went boom & having a little correct too, like majority of Crypto's that do boom
2548 2018-01-04 20:56:48 Thanks! Best of luck to you.
2549 2018-01-04 20:56:47 I would look at market cap. How far can TRX go? double market cap? tripple? maybe/maybe not. Not my favourite project, people just buy in because its cheap but its no longer profitable (max 300% gain). 1/2
2550 2018-01-04 20:56:33 Dope lol
2551 2018-01-04 20:56:26 If $btc breaks past $15400 levels, cut your #Altcoins and stay on #Bitcoin temporarily. There would be alt bloodbath and that too temporary ;) you can buyback at dip

2553 2018-01-04 20:56:05 #2018Predictions: #usitech collapses as investors start to find 1% returns of stagnating $BTC less attractive compared to #crypto altcoins.

2556 2018-01-04 20:56:01 It will be great to see such growth in the $bitCNY supply and having a 2x collateralized, fiat-pegged #crypto that sends in <3 seconds, holders can feel confident in its value

2571 2018-01-04 20:54:35 My buddy does crypto trading as a living and makes 6 figures doing so. So to say he's not an investor is just foolish. Both him and I started as stock investors then gradually transition into crypto because you can make triple digit gains per day if you time it right.
2572 2018-01-04 20:54:32 These are how dumb rumors start. Good job! 
2573 2018-01-04 20:54:15 What is your profit taking strategy? Do you hold your runners regardless of BTC’s movements? It’s a timing skill I’m having trouble developing, but one that I’m also seeing many schools of thought on.

2581 2018-01-04 20:53:38 Here at Scambase, we prefer to create exorbitant need for competition in our market by refusing to add the most demanded coin in crypto, all while fucking over our customers via insider trading & arbitrary inflated price valuation. Anything contrary is not authorized by Scambase
2582 2018-01-04 20:53:36 Ripple is not a crypto.. It's a SCAM! Ripple tokens hold no monetary value and not required to carry out transactions.. That's the reason why we can't buy ripple using fiat currency to transfer our funds around, Instead they want to "seize" bitcoin and eth in exchange for XRP

2595 2018-01-04 20:52:36 Can you TA #FunFair? the charts look unsustainable
2596 2018-01-04 20:52:33 Sure. Do you know what happened in every virtual world when the official currency hyper inflated? Players invented their own, selecting something else that was fungible, portable, and scarcity-bound. This isn’t new.
2597 2018-01-04 20:52:30 I just got the best trading platform could trade everything at once stock fx crypto commodities 
2598 2018-01-04 20:52:23 you think asia will sell and it goes down?

2601 2018-01-04 20:51:59 Kucoin said is updating and some users can have problems during this
2602 2018-01-04 20:51:53 If you’re looking for another hot crypto to buy while it’s cheap go buy as much #TRX as you can. Now!! #tron
2603 2018-01-04 20:51:51 Massive sell-off occurring across #crypto - this is healthy. 

Prices can’t ONLY go up. Investment will flow back stronger than ever.
$btc $eth $trx $xrp $xlm
2604 2018-01-04 20:51:48 Risk is crypto swings. But offsets all cash problems to dedicated atm company. Which is legal to have banking. AFAIK
2605 2018-01-04 20:51:47 This just signifies an even bigger apparent bull run for 2018 when people like Zuckerberg giving it attention
2606 2018-01-04 20:51:40 Your small give away has become a monster. Mitta, what do you do overnight? Ie, Hold crypto on the exchange or in your Trezor as a major coin?

2609 2018-01-04 20:51:33 Are you fucking serious. Crypto market changes fast and i can lose moneu
2610 2018-01-04 20:51:32 Keep up the good work Iris, and if there's any shilling I do, it's for @21Cryptos!
2611 2018-01-04 20:51:29 If you buy cars, you aren't an investor, it's a hobby. But crypto trading can be too. It's becoming more and more regulated and we'll see a huge shift in the future to more crypto payments. Amazon is about to accept both Bitcoin and XRP and use Ripple Net to transfer OTB exchages
2612 2018-01-04 20:51:27 А мне интересно, когда наконец деда поднимется со своего дивана и когда Ripple выпьет валерьяночки, он слишком возбужден. Он так возбужден, что я боюсь его покупать перед коррекцией
2613 2018-01-04 20:51:18 I'm glad they didn't!!!
2614 2018-01-04 20:51:16 wish I could buy into the frenzy while it lasted price is going up like a crypto currency
2615 2018-01-04 20:51:13 Crypto IS sooooooo manipulated.....
2616 2018-01-04 20:51:13 Also there are too many exchanges offering all the exotic coins/tokens. They can't afford to only trade 4 cryptos IMO.
2617 2018-01-04 20:51:12 Just a normal crypto atm to debit card. Merchant accept debt card crypto. Has to hold crypto because still has banking problems (holding cash)
2618 2018-01-04 20:51:07 I can deposit but not trade.. are you seeing something else or just speculating? $XRB
2619 2018-01-04 20:51:07 I wonder what the opportunity cost is for all he money flooding into anything “crypto” right now. Would it otherwise be sitting in cash? Is it delaying homeownership or DOW 30,000?
2620 2018-01-04 20:51:06 Read the full article & their links - thanks for sharing!
However the fallacies they indicate are:
1) Point of Sale (e.g. Starbucks with crypto)
2) Fiat/Crypto transactions
Therefore I am not convinced. As long as #XVG pairs with other crypto #btc or #eth it can avoid both issues

2623 2018-01-04 20:50:45 Lol @Crypto_goat_ all you do is peddle, peddle, peddle. Charlie knows what he is talking about and you’re over here just 2018! Year of this- year of that- total bullshit. Ripple will crash. People are buying XRP not Ripple. Know the difference?
2624 2018-01-04 20:50:35 Why can't we buy Ripple with fait currency? Answer: Because Ripple is a huge scam created to "seize" the real crypto such as bitcoin and ether. Ripple tokens hold no monetary value and not required to carry out transactions.. Centralised with huge supply owed by ripple labs.
2625 2018-01-04 20:50:34 If I want low cost, fast transactions I'll use a faster coin like $ltc or $dgb not some rip off of $btc. #bcash is NOT #Bitcoin

2628 2018-01-04 20:50:18 I agree. The only thing they said is they aren't adding new coins at this time. People read too much into that. They are trying to get away from being accused of insider trading
2629 2018-01-04 20:50:15 I'm heavily invested in stocks and crypto and see both as great investments if you know what you're doing. I've made 250% in two days trading crypto for example and am up a couple hundred % in stocks. Saying someone who trades crypto isn't an investor is just downright stupid.
2630 2018-01-04 20:50:14 so far everything is happening like a plan from the A-Team. Even doing better than the plan :)))
2631 2018-01-04 20:49:59 1 year in crypto goes fast bro. Who the fuck would have thought xrp would be 2nd last year.
Or even reach 1$ :)
2632 2018-01-04 20:49:57 Spotify’s direct IPO seems… odd.
If you’re going non-traditional (stay with me here)…why not ICO? 
The Venn diagram of “people buying crypto” and “spotify users” is basically a circle. Could be first large, legit, stable token offering.

2635 2018-01-04 20:49:50 Crypto update: Buy some XLM while it's under 70 cents, you likely won't get this chance again. I'm gonna buy more VEN, though. I am addicted.
2636 2018-01-04 20:49:48 Look at it this way. People are investing in crypto and taking their winnings. They will reinvest again and the consolidation will end. All these coins are in an infinitely better position than they were 2 days ago, let alone 2 weeks, 2 months, 2 years etc
2637 2018-01-04 20:49:46 Surely the crypto space is big enough for both of you (and others) to be successful. So why not be the guy that not only welcomes that friendly competition but also embraces it

2648 2018-01-04 20:49:16 The hand picked crypto of the banking and political elite. What do you expect?
2649 2018-01-04 20:49:13 Coinbase has the best chance to pull it together.  But I do think another company is going to come in and be the big player.  Crypto traders will move their money in a heartbeat to a platform they like.

2653 2018-01-04 20:49:03 Let's hope Ripple takes a huge dive... Ripple is not a crypto.. It's a SCAM! Ripple tokens hold no monetary value and not required to carry out transactions.. Centralised with huge supply owed by ripple labs.. Offers no innovation....

Combined with the state of the crypto trading craze, it's a great support for what is going to be a monstrous time in alts. Binance is not taking new users for a short time, same with Bittrex

perfect storm
2666 2018-01-04 20:48:16 Thats the nature of crypto world. Everything is temporary :)

2672 2018-01-04 20:47:38 You gave up on crypto?!!!
2673 2018-01-04 20:47:31 I’m not talking about the modern financial framework, but about more fundamental dynamics than that.

2675 2018-01-04 20:47:24 Well people being told ripple being added need to now the FUD they are being fed.
2676 2018-01-04 20:47:15 I don't understand the motive as to why #Coinbase would release such a statement about not adding a coin such as #XRP #ripple. What warranted it? Perhaps it was the rise of the smaller coins jumping the Crypto-ranks. Regardless, it's market manipulation & FUD at it's finest.
2677 2018-01-04 20:47:11 わらいました…笑
ご自愛ください…
2678 2018-01-04 20:47:05 The same can be said about virtually every crypto. S Korea pumps the most volume on all of them. However, Ripple has a level of control and supply certainty because of their escrowed 55B XRP. It’s just a matter of when they start changing Banks Nostro Accounts over.
2679 2018-01-04 20:47:05 Me: “Think I’ll put all my financial assets into a crypto currency and finance website that’s profoundly secure.”

2680 2018-01-04 20:47:01 Agree, most crypto investors don't see fiat as the safe asset to own.

2699 2018-01-04 20:45:25 TRX has beaten all odds. Earlier the rule of Crypto was based on market coin supply, no of exchanges it is listed, and who are the partner backing it and financial backings and a working product. Not sure if it addressed all these conditions>

2720 2018-01-04 20:43:44 Agreed. People selling off due to massive gains. Watch the pattern in charts. Consolidate.
2721 2018-01-04 20:43:42 Entries are the most important thing in Crypto. If your entry is godlike, you don't need to worry about any dips. You just have to wait and sell when you're comfortable

2736 2018-01-04 20:42:17 Yeah I'm pretty much the same way, I suppose it depends on the amount of BTC you have in total to work with, but we should always have Reserves in our portfolio, Bitcoin, cash, precious metals IMO  ALWAYS.  Are You full time?

2738 2018-01-04 20:41:55 the only women in crypto that i make fun of or ignore are the ones pumping shitcoins, same as with the men. meritocracy.
2739 2018-01-04 20:41:53 For the last month, I've been expanding the number of crypto exchanges on which I have accounts. Some exchanges are halting new user registrations. I'm glad I started early. Now is the time to get started, if you're not already in this space.
2740 2018-01-04 20:41:47 The only thing I learned from the past couple of days is that people are not interested in decentralization narrative. Which makes it likely that state distributed crypto will probably be popular (too). #bitcoin
2741 2018-01-04 20:41:42 As soon as I buy an altcoin the shit drops...I’m just holding all the crypto Ls lately
2742 2018-01-04 20:41:35 If I am understanding you correctly -- I agree there is much more upside AND downside to a token during it's infancy. I just think a lot of people are going to be left HODLing the token bag and crypto wisdom will say 'prove it to us on a sidechain'
2743 2018-01-04 20:41:31 Yes very nice but the world of crypto lending programs is full of 'gunna's'; guna do this & guna do that but most never happens, that why BCC & DAV way out in front; so how about fixing current btc wd 'requests' days old.
2744 2018-01-04 20:41:29 Always one step ahead, those aussies!
2745 2018-01-04 20:41:22 Never mind the fact that no crypto currency anytime soon is going to be advanced enough to not require human intervention in order to react to economic externalities the way a government can.
2746 2018-01-04 20:41:20 For reference. I am not talking about XRB, just currencies in general. No-one seems to ask questions about network security anymore. Or actual development plans. It's all about tps and profit. I mean, I like profit but crypto is about more than profit.
2747 2018-01-04 20:41:19 2010 flash crash, 2008 market crash, dot com bubble. The value lost in crypto exchange hacks are a drop in the bucket comparitively.
2748 2018-01-04 20:41:17 Ik haven't been able to login all night until a few minutes ago, and today wasn't the only time. if you charge money/$crypto for services rendered, better make sure the shit works.

2752 2018-01-04 20:40:59 What should do in that situation???hodl or sell
2753 2018-01-04 20:40:50 Also, XRP is basically not a crypto as it's centralized and 60% of the out of thin air created tokens belong to ripple inc. Ripple inc would be the 10th largest company in the world. Are you sure you want to put your money in this pseudo crypto? And yes I hold @Ripple $xrp
2754 2018-01-04 20:40:48 Thank God! Definitely not ready for another tailspin in the market. Or seeing you guys propping up a centralized crypto. I'd be doing the coup at that point

2797 2018-01-04 20:38:45 When looking at potential #cryptocurrency investments, I try and compare the market caps to a non crypto company. It cant be 1:1 correlated, but it gives a reasonable gauge of its valuation, or worth. You will soon see, dozens of crypto start-ups are grossly overvalued.
2798 2018-01-04 20:38:44 Waiting on the bank to lift the hold on my account to buy crypto currency got me pacing back and forth mumbling to myself “sending money to London shouldn’t be a red flag” even tho all my transactions are from the gas station and Taco Bell up the road from me.

2880 2018-01-04 20:33:50 Will #bitcoin reach $50k in 2018? #blockchain #crypto
2881 2018-01-04 20:33:44 Many mine copper as well and that is another big plus to the bottom line.
Hopefully we will be seeing some juicy dividend announcements to awaken the fang crypto crowd from their apathy towards value.
2882 2018-01-04 20:33:43 Forehead?
2883 2018-01-04 20:33:43 And $DOT lol, obviously
2884 2018-01-04 20:33:41 Actually, can you give us a list of approved coins? BTC uses lots of power, so isn't that environmentally unfriendly? Isn't BCH manipulated? Can I only buy ETC, not ETH? Could you start a paid group doing FA of "Yoda approved coins", or is that against the spirit of crypto too?
2885 2018-01-04 20:33:40 Watch $BTC I'm feeling a big push coming
2886 2018-01-04 20:33:33 100 JPY(BTC): 1218.865 ~ 1221.412 KRW(BTC)
2887 2018-01-04 20:33:30 My strong belief is that USI-Tech is the real deal and should be investigated by everyone. Crypto investing is intimidating 2 the novice investor. It's a huge learning curve for most. But a goal of participating in a way that grows bitcoin, that's too good a proposition 2 ignore.
2888 2018-01-04 20:33:29 This year is kicking butt so far for me. Business booming, stocks up, crypto currencies up. Love it.
2889 2018-01-04 20:33:22 I trust kraken but they take a long time. They've done well for me over the years so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now. Doesn't mean I'm not pissed.

2893 2018-01-04 20:33:15 I'm familiar with the Mt. God finesse, in just saying risks are everpresent. NASDAQ has halted trading causing prices to crash more times than crypto exchanges have been hacked in recent years.
2894 2018-01-04 20:33:02 Pretty close....
2895 2018-01-04 20:33:02 @BillSimmons @ringer excited for you guys to buy my #Crypto + #Sports #Podcast I'm launching. It'll look good under that #Ringer logo. Won't be cheap though. Putting the finishing touches on a name... speak now or forever hold your peace.  #TimeStamp
2896 2018-01-04 20:32:58 That wouldn’t be a bad thing if it’s true though. If they fool enough people into thinking the price is what they are manipulating it to be, then when the exchange opens to everyone, maybe it won’t be a mass dump. But they better have lending and staking ready to go too

2901 2018-01-04 20:32:40 Crypto is going to explode this year. Last year was only a taste. Hop on before you get left behind. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.

2906 2018-01-04 20:32:29 Exactly. I think it's a little fishy how much time and energy is going into hating on #xvg by all these supposed #crypto gurus when clearly #wraithprotocol works. Clearly the powers that be don't want us to have access to a real, legit privacy coin.
2907 2018-01-04 20:32:29 That a hublot?
2908 2018-01-04 20:32:22 The latter actually is a good point. All crypto/tokens/assets/whatever still end up in the same list. Categorization is necessary.
2909 2018-01-04 20:32:22 More insider trading going on no doubt
2910 2018-01-04 20:32:18 what is the target for this wave 4 correction?
2911 2018-01-04 20:32:17 @davidgokhshtein Broad de-risking across the Alts in the last couple of hours as $ flow into BTC, pushing it slightly +ve. I firmly believe when JP & SK wake up, they will take $POE, $ADA, $TRX, & $CND higher... This 24hrs move was nice, but its just the beginning... BUY THE DIP!
2912 2018-01-04 20:32:13 Six months ago I cheered when bitcoin went up.. now i cry
2913 2018-01-04 20:32:12 Much appreciated. So not worth pulling out profits into btc for a couple of hours?

2921 2018-01-04 20:31:42 Just a couple of ideas for crypto products:
1. An exchange that accepts airline miles or points
2. A coin or fund that pays quarterly dividends
2922 2018-01-04 20:31:42 Natural market fluctuations with btc going up a bit, nothing special ^^
2923 2018-01-04 20:31:31 $300 doesn't seem so far away now... and 1/5 away from $500... the next $eth in the making? Watch the ico kick in...
2924 2018-01-04 20:31:24 Ya and it’s fucking with the people’s money that make coinbase all their millions.  They should be careful how they tweet @coinbase
2925 2018-01-04 20:31:23 That wait for your #ETH to arrive in your #Binance exchange account from #Coinbase is sooooo excruciating...especially when you‘re looking to jump on a low price opportunity! #cryptodrama

2947 2018-01-04 20:30:00 DUDE, please educate yourself. This whole crypto movement is about giving power back to the people. Decentralization, Trustless, Censorship Resistant transacting. An "Agreement" between people requires TRUST. Do you not see the problems behind the models of Ripple and XRP?

2954 2018-01-04 20:29:32 Why would that be?
2955 2018-01-04 20:29:13 And plus crypto is called a horrible idea from many many many professional investors. If the people who are true professional investors weather it be hedge fund managers or just stock brokers are calling it a bad trade, why are so many people still investing with no knowledge
2956 2018-01-04 20:29:09 For the electrum wallet at least, those are real IPs/Wallet addresses. Mines on there and I will happily prove it to you in private if you really want.
2957 2018-01-04 20:29:04 I hate that hype beasts took Bitcoin and ran with it. It's beauty is not in that it will make you rich. It's the decentralization of currency. What the Internet did for information, crypto currency will do for the economy.
2958 2018-01-04 20:29:03 I foresee some good opportunities soon
2959 2018-01-04 20:28:59 It’s a centralized asset. The people who created Coinbase will get shitted on by the crypto World  like JOHN Queer McAfee

2982 2018-01-04 20:26:54 Says you? What good is bitcoin to me for moving money, when it can take hours in some cases for those payments to clear? Disclaimer: I hold BTC, but am not myopic enough to think that different crypto's can't have different utilities and places in the ecosystem.

2989 2018-01-04 20:26:16 Agreed - but we had to expect it this. Watch the next 7 months as the price gradually drops. It's purpose is not Fiat 2.0, it's purpose is accumulate BTC - ain't gettin none of mine.
2990 2018-01-04 20:26:13 I Think, peoples are evaluating crypto coin through their connection to Banks, technological companies, through business plans. Rather value rises through sentiments or speculations.
2991 2018-01-04 20:26:01 Wot? This is a pretty standard distribution. Why is it illogical? Do you expect every crypto to have a fair share?
2992 2018-01-04 20:25:49 Vol will remain low since there's no sellers

2996 2018-01-04 20:25:32 There are risks associated with all investments. Flash crashes happen all the time off the stock market and the climate off the early stock market was actual much worse than the current crypto market, word to Black Friday.

2998 2018-01-04 20:25:22 Crypto is a unregulated currency that can take some times days to trade, doesn't follow the market times or laws. Crypto isn't investing, it's a guessing game. It's like investing in cars. Yes it can make you money, but I'd never call myself a investor because of it.

3018 2018-01-04 20:23:58 No, it is hyper inflated right now and is overdue a huge correction. XRP is also a coin that goes against everything crypto's stand for and the more people find out about it the more they will pull out long term.

3030 2018-01-04 20:23:01 Better make sure you realize some of those profits and be aware that things are not perpetually going to go up. Precious metals are good and crypto currencies as well.
3031 2018-01-04 20:22:53 Why not just use a market stop loss when alt season is just beginning??
3032 2018-01-04 20:22:52 In my opinion hodl for $xrp till end of january. #coinmama will list it.

3048 2018-01-04 20:21:30 But seems going down in 2018. Over 600 billion $  investment on crypto and BCH down. Ripple has gains 15 time since Dec2017. I sold ripple in 18th Nov17 €0.17 and bought BCH. now Ripple, Cardino, NEM, Steller, experence, rabirock shoots up.

3054 2018-01-04 20:20:46 I wouldnt be surprise if this behaviour end with the long alt seasons and change to short pumps and squeeze people. Way more profitable for the smart ones

3080 2018-01-04 20:19:48 @Haejin_Crypto Hi. Would you consider doing an update on XRP? I saw you did a post 6 days ago, but a lot has changed! This is one crazy ride. I was wondering if your $4.11 target has changed based on recent action.

3084 2018-01-04 20:19:20 Still hodl? Or sell with loss?
3085 2018-01-04 20:19:18 Don’t forget to set your clock back. 
3086 2018-01-04 20:19:17 My account is still blocked but I got a message saying it was temporary to improve the exchange experience for other users. Considering I only have btc no UCH that’s probably why. At least they’re making an effort and this post by crypto bouse gives us hope

3100 2018-01-04 20:18:25 It’s not.  They are gonna kill crypto.  Why do you think Goldman Sachs is waiting til June to open their trading desk???  They are going to learn everything about it.  Hire mathematicians, founders of successful companies, and yes, the best in crypto.  Dumb ass statements!
3101 2018-01-04 20:18:23 Why I love $XVG? Because it's Crypto 2.0, a new standard for #cryptocurrency.

In fact, I feel that it provides a way for novice crypto currency investors that don't have the skills to participate, but will dearly want to jump in judging by the 700 Billion, soon to be Trillion cap.

3127 2018-01-04 20:17:00 Seriously, get out well you still have it.  Is a quick lesson on stop losses in order?  When they lose their ass on $xrp, it's only going to hurt the community.   People need to know how to minimize the losses that are coming on xrp so they can roll those profits into our bags.

3135 2018-01-04 20:16:17 This will be the longest and biggest dip ever seen in the crypto world. 
3136 2018-01-04 20:16:16 have been selling any alt coins with decent gains back into bitcoin. getting a sense alt coins, per the cycle of crypto life, are way overextended and will start falling back down soon to consolidate. that means bitcoin will be gathering steam for another lunge at $20K and beyond
3137 2018-01-04 20:16:14 Very true. The fascinating thing about trading is how that lack of safeguards attracts some and absolutely repulses others. 

It would also be interesting to see a chi-square on a random sample of crypto v forex traders. If I had the free time...

3145 2018-01-04 20:15:45 I highly recommend listening to the bad crypto podcast. the escrow is a legal standing escrow. people act like it's in a cold wallet just waiting... it is not even in the hands of xrp.. hence the word escrow... see ya at $100 when it hits coinbase

3149 2018-01-04 20:15:30 You're delusional if you think Ripple will obtain that. It's a centralized crap coin for banks. Stellar Lumens (XLM) is a much better crypto.

3155 2018-01-04 20:14:37 If there is $125bn of dumb money in xrp all of a sudden + it slowly realizes crypto is great but #btc has much more going for it..

if or when #xrp dumps - #bitcoin could rise faster than anyone could imagine..

surely mainstream media will dig up a few of those early scandals

3160 2018-01-04 20:14:00 I hear what you're saying but given the crypto sphere has been so serious all these years it's great to have 2 major devs poke at each other light heartedly. Maybe they'll work together someday..
3161 2018-01-04 20:13:56 I doubt that they would want to personally be the reason xrp would take over BTC in Cap. They like money but these are OGs too. Oh well, will just take longer for the masses to buy.

3173 2018-01-04 20:13:05 @robotodd Curious to know if you consider telling your readers what a #crypto coin's function is rather than just pumping the chance for returns. Not once in your #XRP article do you mention the purpose/mission.
3174 2018-01-04 20:13:02 2017: yay I got a tax refund!

2018: damn no wonder rich people hate paying taxes.

3199 2018-01-04 20:11:04 let's be honest here. Justin is your "best CEO" because he pumped the shit out of TRX and making you money. there are hundreds of coins and CEOs in crypto space now, which CEO dare to shamelessly shill and pump his coins in bright light day after day.

3204 2018-01-04 20:10:53 Your attitude is much different then many other crypto investors. That’s why I like following you and learning from you. Thank you.
3205 2018-01-04 20:10:51 @SimonDingle What’s the best app to buy alternate crypto’s in za? 

Or even a non-za platform to buy cryptos that supports za?
3206 2018-01-04 20:10:45 Also, Coinbase has now seen the market disruption & Bitcoin devaluation from adding just one coin. If they continue to add others, then Bitcoin will come crashing down and the entire crypto market will destabilize and plummet. They don't want that. (1)
3207 2018-01-04 20:10:44 I think you are legit, but if I can make a suggestion, maybe you can do it similar to @fentaso (100% Legit), small amounts to more people - instead of a large amount to one person -, and it may will bring a bit more followers, and #VergeFam to the mix.  #2cents =)

3225 2018-01-04 20:09:38 Other than Bitcoin, what crypto-currencies can one buy real goods and services with?
3226 2018-01-04 20:09:34 There is now no question that the entire #blockchain #crypto market is in a major #bubble. Top 100 coin price charts are all hockey sticks. This can only end badly, and will likely force the heavy hand of regulators. Very disappointing, but the overall industry will endure...
3227 2018-01-04 20:09:22 Ripple isn't a real cryptocurrency though. Made by banks who own >60%, they could sell tomorrow and collect your money. The point of crypto is that it's decentralised, so nobody can do that.
3228 2018-01-04 20:09:15 Yeah ETH
3229 2018-01-04 20:09:09 I guess few days after 16th Jan. after they sell the rest of ICO tokens. in crowdsale
3230 2018-01-04 20:09:08 XRP is doing well and is very fashionable but daaaamn it could ruin the whole crypto game. It's stands for everything Bitcoin etc are fighting against.

3235 2018-01-04 20:08:32 I predict @justinsuntron will have the most followers of any influential Crypto Leader by the end of 2018 (maybe next month at this pace) #tron #trx
3236 2018-01-04 20:08:31 TRX is going to do very well. No doubt.  But right now I wouldn't sell my XRP.  Just me, been wrong b4 hope it's enough gain to make a difference.
3237 2018-01-04 20:08:29 I should have asked someone to double check it for me. Thanks!
3238 2018-01-04 20:08:28 Ripple is direct threat for swift who have monopole of transaction settlement business, Swift are now working on blokchain and guess what, they will use XRP as crypto. We need to think in trillions here.

3243 2018-01-04 20:08:16 In desktop version of Coinbase, go to "Buy/Sell" and select the card you make a payment with. Their it should say "Weekly card limit" and next to it "Increase card limit."

3247 2018-01-04 20:08:07 Sorry twitch people my very pathetic twitch career is taking a short break for a while while I pursue crypto. So unfollow me if that isn't something your're into, I will understand. But if you want to join the journey of crypto stay tuned :)
3248 2018-01-04 20:08:04 my theory, is that it probably would have, until the insanity ensued,  and if they followed through with the add, the shit storm they would have received would have been much worse than this #bombcyclone in the north east!

3251 2018-01-04 20:07:46 The point of crypto currencies is to be decentralized and not controlled by any entities except the people.

This is a major threat to our current financial system especially Banks. Do not be surprised if Banks try to get involved to mitigate loss of control Thanks CryptoYoda1338

3269 2018-01-04 20:05:59 @phlegm_bot
3270 2018-01-04 20:05:57 Initial focus of $LINX is EM, but check out the info on the retail integration and browser plugin. That will enable bloggers and a whole lot of other folks to take crypto (Linx) on their sites easily. Sounds big to me.
3271 2018-01-04 20:05:55 I think a lot of $TRX rise is due to it being so cheap compared to other top 20 coins. #Tron isn't exactly a technical innovator; decentralizing data has been around on the web before it. Feels like newcomers to #crypto see cheaper coins as more attractive.
3272 2018-01-04 20:05:55 Thats what I was trying to say. They are playing with the marketprice on purpose to buy in low. I hope it sky rockets even more. These crypto exchanges are really criminals, really.

3283 2018-01-04 20:05:14 This tech boom will continue to spur so much innovation and creativity it will leave the world shocked. $Crypto is only one aspect.
3284 2018-01-04 20:05:09 It’s definitely a good investment. I feel like the real money to be made would definitely be in ripple at the moment, I stopped fucking w bitcoin for right now. Any leftover money anyone has should be going into ripple. It’s going to create the next wave of millionaires in crypto
3285 2018-01-04 20:05:00 Look for low market caps to play a big role now for crypto to push beyond 1 Tril. Bitcoin will look healthy at around 25-28% market cap moving into 2018

3287 2018-01-04 20:04:49 Don't think crypto has pork in it. We're probably safe!
3288 2018-01-04 20:04:48 In May, called up each of the fam and told them a crypto bubble was coming. When they started arguing with me, I told them: "I'm not trying to change your mind. If it's not for you, that's fine. This is just so you can't say I didn't give you a chance after it booms."
3289 2018-01-04 20:04:43 In a bull market with limited choices like crypto, opportunity costs are as real as they can be.

You "lose money" when you hold an asset that is stagnant while other assets are rising quickly in value.

3317 2018-01-04 20:02:58 Reasoning? I see that $TRX has good contracs and more to come but seems like a good hype train. If this alleged ‘major’ contract isn’t as amazing as the owner makes it out to be then $TRX could take a MAJOR dip.
3318 2018-01-04 20:02:57 18 (i.e. before plastic surgery) was better in my opinion
3319 2018-01-04 20:02:52 I respect your opinion man but why not issue “warnings” for every coin out there like this. Like, what’s your opinion on BCH, among other sketchy products? Ripple has remained transparent throughout their process. With concise and solid plans to decentralize as much as possible.

3323 2018-01-04 20:02:35 Ya. But if it’s under their system - their guys are advisors. And have to give sound financial advice. If crypto blows up and people lose their ass, as a fiduciary you can be held liable.

3327 2018-01-04 20:02:15 You haven't enabled the VPN with orbot. Mine was that way until I did that. Cleared catch and restarted my phone. It does say that on the playstore verge app info 
3328 2018-01-04 20:02:12 Its been great! Used to work out, have RL friends, a girlfriend, a nice house and family. Now live under bridge, relatives dont want anything to do with me, reek of alcohol and sweat, use iPhone 3G to get crypto fix and lost joy of living.

Thx #crypto, u really changed my life!

3339 2018-01-04 20:01:36 I like both. If you want a long term hold than $VRM has you covered, if you want something to move around cheaply and take advantage of market cycles then $VRC has got what you need

3372 2018-01-04 19:59:41 Trx tron I feel like is going to be the next big crypto currency after ripple! But I’d definitely recommend getting into ripple. If I were you I’d buy in now while it’s dropped a bit. It reached $3.33 yesterday and that’s a new high

3375 2018-01-04 19:59:31 You do realise that not every single crypto booms at the same time right? Plus look back at the gains $xvg has had over the last few months. It was always going to consolidate it's price. THEN BOOM again soon
3376 2018-01-04 19:59:27 What are you thoughts on the following? I have $250 - $350 left over after the thousands I’ve put into other currencies. Should I go for $ARK , $LINK , $ADA or $TRX - leaning towards LINK or TRX.

3385 2018-01-04 19:59:01 Not necessarily. It depends on the task. E.x: a compiler that provides static guarantees around timing attacks on regions of code around scheduling/instructions to use/etc that would allow for crypto algorithms in assembly to be lifted into c. That wouldn't be too hard IMO.

3410 2018-01-04 19:57:49 Holy shit 17th?! I guess benefits is we don't sell so early. I just want them out as I don't feel safe leaving it on the exchange.

Having said that, bit strange why an exchange of this low tier needs documents to verify... bittrex and binance are huge and don't do this.

3428 2018-01-04 19:55:50 I’m totally agree with you.

I’m a Japanese. I think XRB is not popular in Asia. But Asia is the biggest market in crypto currency. So there is a massive potential to expand market.

Binance is popular in Korea and Japanese. It’s good opportunity to expand.

3459 2018-01-04 19:53:47 @crypto_axe Are you still confident with your WandX-call? Did you have a look at the beta they launched an hour ago and the new roadmap? Thanks and have a good day.
3460 2018-01-04 19:53:44 Yea Delta is GREAT
3461 2018-01-04 19:53:44 Aandacht voor blockdingen is imho wat afgevlakt in de pers. Die Crypto muntjes trekken en krijgen vooralsnog meer aandacht. Aantal blockevents voor 2018 ook nog bescheiden
3462 2018-01-04 19:53:35 Just not sure why the market hasn't picked up on everything $UEPS has in crypto and payment systems. Has everything and trading at 9 pe. Have a feeling one day its just going to bust out!

3467 2018-01-04 19:53:28 No real value? American Express is already using it as a method of payment. The block chain technology that is being tested in Japanese & Korean banks is set to be rolled out now in Jan. Crypto isn't a life investment but quick easy money. XRP is easy money
3468 2018-01-04 19:53:25 We're working on scaling our team to the new volume & attention that the crypto space is receiving.

3471 2018-01-04 19:53:18 BYEBYE $XRP
3472 2018-01-04 19:53:17 The faithful are being rewarded in #bitcoin as she keeps bouncing off of the 50 day #crypto #btc
3473 2018-01-04 19:53:00 There are a finite amount of a lot of the crypto currencies and to say that there isn’t just proves you haven’t done any research on the topic at all!
Just like stocks, do your due diligence and make your decisions on which ones u c have value going forward..
3474 2018-01-04 19:52:58 Its a big deal. Xem is a top 10 coin. And there are a lot of people waiting for a long time without any information.
3475 2018-01-04 19:52:54 Next time I'm definitely entering "hold my beer" mode.
3476 2018-01-04 19:52:50 We need to couple that raw water to a crypto coin and put it on a blockchain!
3477 2018-01-04 19:52:44 are bignum test vectors (i.e. large numbers that once triggered a bug in a crypto library) copyrightable?
3478 2018-01-04 19:52:43 Nigeria and Ghana are leading the way. Nigeria is @paxful ‘s #1 market beating the usa and lil ghana is #3 amazing how africans are solving problems and using crypto to build REAL value, while we in the west just play speculation games..
3479 2018-01-04 19:52:40 The likely answer is that they cannot liquidate even 1% of their positions. Any sell signal that large would crash the crypto's price and overwhelm the exchange.
3480 2018-01-04 19:52:33 ^^^ tells me to do research  - please look up the two names I just gave you and you will find that they both use $XRP + Ripple software
3481 2018-01-04 19:52:31 I'm using tabtrader it has nice graphs gadgets like alarms that you can set up. Also has indicators like RSI, EMA and other stuff to track your alts
3482 2018-01-04 19:52:21 I DID! Gained some amount of XRPs in a few minutes!
3483 2018-01-04 19:52:18 Short $XRP get rich.
3484 2018-01-04 19:52:04 that's some davinci code right there!
3485 2018-01-04 19:51:57 Is it true bro, it dépendance on what ?
3486 2018-01-04 19:51:50 Cómo hay gente que odia las crypto currencies. Yo no las odio, ni las amo, el pedo es que sigo sin entender cómo funcionan. Ps. Vean deepweb
3487 2018-01-04 19:51:30 if you want to loose money right now put a buy order in $xrp
3488 2018-01-04 19:51:27 Clearly the mafia banksters are desperate to promoting their own favoured brand of cryptocurrency Ripple in order to transfer their racketeering financial fiat system to the crypto world. Long term Litecoin looks good.
3489 2018-01-04 19:51:27 @CoinMarketCap could you please remove ripple (it's not a crypto) and add a bch donation address thanks $1 @tipprbot
3490 2018-01-04 19:51:26 So apparently Cape Town is full of FitFluencers and Crypto Gurus. I decided to put this to the test on New Year’s Eve. Whilst waiting to use the lavatory I shouted out “how’s XRP (ripple) doing”. Within 15 seconds there were 5 tanking okes telling me how much money they’ve made.
3491 2018-01-04 19:51:23 I would never buy that cancer coin
3492 2018-01-04 19:51:20 What happen?
3493 2018-01-04 19:51:19 If you add Ripple, you’ll be spitting in the face of “crypto ideology”!
3494 2018-01-04 19:51:17 I’m a Japanese. I think XRB is not popular in Asia. But Asia is the biggest market in crypto currency. So there is a massive potential to expand market.

Binance is popular in Korea and Japanese. It’s good opportunity to expand.
3495 2018-01-04 19:51:15 how do you handle the wealth, fame, and responsibility of being a hugely successful crypto trader
3496 2018-01-04 19:51:13 We are having issues lately and understand how annoying that is. We are upgrading (the upgrades) and have engineers on the servers 24/7. We anticipate an awesome 2018 for crypto as well!
3497 2018-01-04 19:51:07 Watch your ALTS, starting to get dumped.  #Altcoins #Crypto #cryptocurrency
3498 2018-01-04 19:51:05 Wrong question in my opinion. Crypto billionaires are looking to take crypto to a point where you don't have liquidate your position and their currencies become new societal norms.
3499 2018-01-04 19:51:01 $XRP crash will likely cause mass outages amongst crypto exchanges
3500 2018-01-04 19:50:57 As an engineer, I've never in my life seen such poor planning and ability to scale as I'm seeing in the global $crypto market at the moment. It's horribly depressing.

3501 2018-01-04 19:50:52 I'm late to the crypto game, so I only hold 6 LTC at the moment. Would love to have lucky #7.
I think LTC has some surprises in store in 2018.
3502 2018-01-04 19:50:51 What platform do you have the bitcoin in. I.e coinbase etc.. bitcoin fees are quite high. It will cost around $16 dollars in fees to withdraw

3504 2018-01-04 19:50:44 After reading your sentence "Ripple is not a crypto-currency", the more I realized the net effect of this recent pump holds less weight then I thought.  It's in a whole different lane then Bitcoin. Correct me if I'm wrong?
3505 2018-01-04 19:50:44 It's funny how true this is , atleast I have couple bucks in crypto
3506 2018-01-04 19:50:43 LOVE IT!  lol
3507 2018-01-04 19:50:38 That’s your opinion and you have a right to your opinion, and I respect it because I don’t believe in censorship (another tenant of decentralized crypto- censorship resistance). I don’t agree with it however

3530 2018-01-04 19:49:00 You should.  How does it serve anybody to not add xrp and gdax?  Get a clue. Crypto was supposed to make it easy for anybody to do transactions.  I lost 5 hours on a transaction last night, transferring btc to another exchange FROM coinbase, that reported delays AFTER I ordered!
3531 2018-01-04 19:48:57 interesting im in tron aswell. You should check out ENG and REQ. ENG blew up recently. REQ aswell. Still more room to grow since their Marketcap is under 1b.

3535 2018-01-04 19:48:35 Try buying on Binance or Gatehub for ripple. Seems to be a little easier. Most exchanges are slammed right now and taking forever for verification. Crypto is going crazy right now which worries me that it’s turning into a trend that will burn out.

3552 2018-01-04 19:47:34 Great analysis. Widening spreads between USD pairs and Crypto pairs will bring about greater volatility (both on the upside and downside) until those spreads start to shrink.

3563 2018-01-04 19:46:23 $xrp  its a centralised coin where the founder already owns 60% of the market cap. It is far from being trustable. it's always good to make money, but at what cost?. you're pumping a coin that has the opposite objective  of $BTC $LTC $ETH , it's like #brexit or @realDonaldTrump
3564 2018-01-04 19:46:23 who?

so many shitcoins.

3601 2018-01-04 19:44:12 Crypto is a slippery slope when it comes to taking it off line.  Transporting just 1 #Bitcoin outside the US, or into for that matter, without declaring it, could land someone in legal trouble.
People have sewn jewels into garments to flee countries with assets.
3602 2018-01-04 19:44:06 Where exactly did you read that @coinbase was not going to add $XRP ?
3603 2018-01-04 19:44:04 Using Gartner Hype Cycle concepts, I think #crypto should be past the early-adopter phase, and onto mature market. I'm not sure how much more development will improve things. There are some who question the usefulness of blockchain.
3604 2018-01-04 19:44:04 Everyone and their mother seems to be trying to get into crypto currencies now... Can I time travel back to college and carry on mining BTC in 2012 before the ASIC miners got created and released?

3615 2018-01-04 19:43:23 Another #crypto #newbie tip. Know the difference between coins & tokens. #Coins are standalone #cryptocurrency that don’t require another platform to run on. Tokens are built on and can exist on other platforms, e.g. #TRON #ICX sit on #Ethereum platform.
3616 2018-01-04 19:43:21 I seriously can’t wait
3617 2018-01-04 19:43:16 No tricks required. Its a question of competence largely. For example if a candidate is keeping their crypto on a centralized exchange and not bothering to keep it in cold storage, with proper back ups and multi signature security, then why on earth would I trust them to help me.
3618 2018-01-04 19:43:15 @Crypto_Rach What type of coins are you HODLing?
3619 2018-01-04 19:43:13 Crypto, as a whole, is facing an immensely powerful adversary in fiat. Uniting behind Bitcoin gives us the best odds.
3620 2018-01-04 19:43:11 What we need is some kind of way to go after these exchanges when they act irresponsible with our funds.  I have no clue how to go about it but the story of missing crypto in transfer is all to common. On every fricking exchange.
3621 2018-01-04 19:43:06 Hiç bişey olmaz ahali merak etmeyin $btc den bukadar korkmayın. Selcoin haklı, küçük bi panik falan oluşabilir ama aylardır söylüyorum. $btc dominance da istikamet %5 . Evet çok iddialı ve evet herzaman tahminlerim tuttu.
3622 2018-01-04 19:43:05 Modern paradigm of crypto and conventional investing: when you are an idiot you are an idiot. Money will change nothing. #gameofcrypto #dontgettooreal
3623 2018-01-04 19:43:04 Gagging on these gains from shit projects i put into real projects. Crypto is all psychology and cyber security. If you don't have a background in either youre fucked. GG.
3624 2018-01-04 19:43:04 bye bye $xrp
3625 2018-01-04 19:43:00 for insurepal ICO it was said that token distrubtion will be after crowdsale, so if you invested in pre-sale and if you did all correctly then you will get tokens in your etherwallet
3626 2018-01-04 19:42:51 Thanks Yoda. Curious on your thoughts about projects like Crypterium or BABB... not from and investment standpoint, but if you see them as a positive or negative in the future of crypto... any comment is appreciated!
3627 2018-01-04 19:42:46 $CSSI the closer we get to the 30 day mark when the exchange goes live could get interesting pair it with a crypto run and things could get down right silly.
3628 2018-01-04 19:42:46 @SatoshiLite ik keep finding iT difficult to understand how the crypto’s are worth anything. How is ripple 100 billion worth???
3629 2018-01-04 19:42:45 Me neither! but kitties and normies are all over the place now and keep raising chasing that little greed inside of them

3632 2018-01-04 19:42:28 As big as crypto is, millions of people still don’t know about it. I do my best to explain to people the benefits of each coin I have and why they should buy. IMO, #ltc #litecoin is better than #BTC

3638 2018-01-04 19:42:20 A lot of exchanges slowing down & crashed. Too many new ppl joined #crypto party.
3639 2018-01-04 19:42:12 Isn’t this pretty much true of most CEOs and cofounders of major companies? Most of them can’t liquidate their holdings for years. Of course the mechanics are different for crypto and new territory but the problems still mostly the same with fiat currency and stock ownership.

3643 2018-01-04 19:41:58 It’s only surefire if we fal for the pump and dump scheme the banks are using to promote it, it’s not even mined or dectralized like a real crypto. There are plenty of other coins to make coins with, so don’t pick ripple.

3647 2018-01-04 19:41:41 A lot of reputations are being damaged.  And for what? I don't understand the upside in it. Man makes the money, money doesn't make the man. In crypto, this is becoming abundantly clear

3652 2018-01-04 19:41:09 Btw. Ripple is scam. Fucking centralized Ponzi. It's a shame that they are even being talked in crypto subject. They suck! Simple as that
3653 2018-01-04 19:41:05 I will research who satoshi is, become anti-Chinese + try to figure out a way to own the internet + close it for u to stop crypto

urge everyone in crypto to give up - this dude has got it sussed, made me realize #btc has been a waste of time for 3-4 years..

3661 2018-01-04 19:40:36 Always time to get into a crypto
3662 2018-01-04 19:40:30 Crypto!
3663 2018-01-04 19:40:30 Most of these massive ICO’s have really effed up Crypto w/ outlandish promises and “trust me” rhetoric when the BASIC P2P decentralized premise’s aren’t even sound yet.

Mostly vapor ware, money grabs and a BIG to the technology and principles that originally made Crypto great.
3664 2018-01-04 19:40:28 not sure why this is surprising or informative then lol. might as well have asked "who's even buying any $crypto at these prices?"
3665 2018-01-04 19:40:25 I registered to twitter only for crypto and don't get any non-crypto news.
3666 2018-01-04 19:40:21 If any of you own $xrp, you should really do your own research. I really disapprove with what they are doing. But as always; do what YOU want!

I believe the theory it's a bank manipulated and controlled crypto

However it still has so much head space to rise.....
It's a mooner 
3670 2018-01-04 19:40:13 Yes,in my opinion it's only the start of this coin,can't tell you on which price to go in but for long it's  good for SURE!
3671 2018-01-04 19:40:12  Been holding since the ICO - I drool at the possibilities...
3672 2018-01-04 19:40:09 Ripple won't be added to coinbase. Do u think it can still hit 4.11$?
3673 2018-01-04 19:40:07 @CoinExchangeio back up. $XP indeed broke it's ATH with 25 sat.

3676 2018-01-04 19:39:53 guess that CNET was a crypto play (450% later)

3690 2018-01-04 19:39:05 The virtue of leadership, is to align one's identity, with the community's profit/success. The vulgarity of ICOs, is that ICO leaders eat first. In contemporary venture leadership hierarchies, the leaders eat last. IMO - We should encourage our crypto leaders to eat last.

Cualix bank uses $XRP for cross-border payments,
@fxflash uses it + unannounced partnerships?

3704 2018-01-04 19:38:22 This is crypto. This is also a lending platform which puts it in potential scam territory. I support real projects like Eth, Ada, Icx, ecetra. Why da fuck would i be ride or die for a lending platform that is back at ICO levels. Lol. Take an L and move on.

3711 2018-01-04 19:38:04 If you’re going to trade #crypto, you need to trade thoughtfully and patiently. Don’t chase the pump, don’t panic sell the dip. Before you execute, take a breath.

Or chase pumps and panic sell the dips. It keeps the game easy.

3729 2018-01-04 19:36:47 Rest in peace XRP. For the short term. Lots of people bought it solely on the rumor it was being added to coinbase this month.
3730 2018-01-04 19:36:44 This primarily depends on how you buy your coins. If you buy based off FA and you've done solid due-diligence, you should only rarely sell at a loss. If you're a TA maniac chasing pumps you should kill losers fast.

3734 2018-01-04 19:36:30 Because everyone already knows that the CRYPTO XRP has no use. What banks are using is RIPPLE technology. So the Koreans used it to make money and left. Probably finished dumping 40% more and tomorrow rise 50% as happened with BITCOIN.
3735 2018-01-04 19:36:30 I have minor quantities of BTC, ether, and litecoin -- Have been learning to use the core sw to set up test and real nodes -- the only way to test wallets is with actual crypto.

3748 2018-01-04 19:35:47 I keep waiting for the dip to get myself some more $poe....but its not dipping 
3749 2018-01-04 19:35:45 Great article right here man. Thanks for the added value you represent for $Crypto!
3750 2018-01-04 19:35:43 Which other crypto? Name them please...
3751 2018-01-04 19:35:40 it does but it never gets sent to the blockchain.. tried with 20 and 30 gwei
3752 2018-01-04 19:35:39 Feel the exact same way. All the noise in the crypto space forced me to take a step back and re-focus on first principles
3753 2018-01-04 19:35:28 Just to clarify: 

$XRP the crypto currency is DECENTRALIZED. 

@Ripple, the company that created it, is centralized. They ideology that they share with $BTC, is that transactions around the world should be instantaneous and low cost! Only one of them is still on track.
3754 2018-01-04 19:35:25 En gros tu peux te démerder sans lui mais tu vas y passer du temps. 
Si t'es naze, il te permet de gagner un peu. Si t'es bon il te permettra de faire mieux. À toi de voir s'il les vaut ^^
3755 2018-01-04 19:35:25 No love for crypto?
3756 2018-01-04 19:35:23 I think that's symptomatic of their economics being ad driven and the talent war in a small geographic region.

I know crypto economics are often poo poo'ed but what I like is the idea that there are new business models out there

3760 2018-01-04 19:35:07 I see a ,,maybe it’s greener on the other side” syndrome in $CRYPTO right now.
3761 2018-01-04 19:35:07 Investing in ripple will ruin crypto

3763 2018-01-04 19:35:00 I mean look at what happened to ripple, people have been hanging shit on it since forever.
3764 2018-01-04 19:34:58 Don't bring your SJW bullshit in here son, Crypto is still PC-free

3766 2018-01-04 19:34:48 getting familiar with crypto curentcy exchanges - have been using Coinbase and GDAX for a while -- may try bitsane for ripple in the near term -- not sure where to buy/trade iota

3769 2018-01-04 19:34:40 So it doesnt pop up the withdraw order or ??
3770 2018-01-04 19:34:39 Tell them to fix the Android wallet and then we will talk about #FUD
3771 2018-01-04 19:34:33 People living with the EU can revoke their EEA data consent and US citizens allow EEA data consent. Something is super fuzzy with this.

At any rate it seems everyone is having problems getting their transfers out from CBase. Not liking the look of things.
3772 2018-01-04 19:34:29 fuck ripple, the most cancerous thing in the crypto system
3773 2018-01-04 19:34:27 2/2 I'm just getting tired of seeing FUD about XRP and other CC b/c they missed the boat. Salty? Ya think! Understand that when you're investing in crypto, you're saying you believe crypto will replace cash one day. Stay strong. $XRP $XLM $ZRX $GVT $ADA $BAT $POWR $GNT
3774 2018-01-04 19:34:26 The #Bitcoin /#crypto gains have been awesome however I'm in the space for something more fulfilling. Ex: transition of the collective consciousness from the de facto antiquated failed system to one that offers hope, prosperity & equality for all to participate w/o permission!
3775 2018-01-04 19:34:24 I want to make a crypto: RITCOIN
3776 2018-01-04 19:34:16 Wish more of my madden guys would get into Crypto... it's so much $$$ to be made it'll scare ya!!!!
3777 2018-01-04 19:34:16 And what do we think of #LEND?
3778 2018-01-04 19:34:15 I don't deny that XRP is an extension of the traditional banking system extending into the crypto space. I also cannot deny it's made me a ton of money and provided freedom I didn't previously have.
3779 2018-01-04 19:34:14 Combine crypto currency with cryptosporidium: a store that sells raw water but only accepts bitcoin. #PeakSiliconValley
3780 2018-01-04 19:34:07 This is it. I’m going to die here just listening to people talk about crypto currencies.
3781 2018-01-04 19:34:04 We have jumped off the cliff of reasonableness. 2-3 of the top 25 projects actually deserve 75-100% of their market caps. 

I don't think even crypto OG's are going to give you shit for recommending an alt based on the chart, IMO everyone understands this is a bubble now.
3782 2018-01-04 19:34:03 You cannot “invest” in cryptocurrency you can only “speculate” it’s price.  Crypto doesn’t allow you to have any equity and has high risk. You’re better off with a SPX mutual fund with 10% of your savings and 401k’s. Can’t have all the income you want fast it’s 2-5 years usually.
3783 2018-01-04 19:34:02 Best crypto club period. Much appreciated Birb!! 
3784 2018-01-04 19:33:57 Crypto Ax lol. What a pleasure. And thank you @The_WhiteMist is a big fan of yours
3785 2018-01-04 19:33:53 Never a dull day in the crypto space!
3786 2018-01-04 19:33:50 hearing about a rotation into stocks from crypto

3788 2018-01-04 19:33:46 I heard about  $mana coin burn 2 days ago....got myself a couple k and its already almost doubled and may double again by tomorrow ....gotta love crypto
3789 2018-01-04 19:33:39 crypto currency seems so interesting but i have no idea what it is
3790 2018-01-04 19:33:37 Did you get beetoken presale @DiaryofaMadeMan
3791 2018-01-04 19:33:37 Crypto currencies remind me a lot of otcqb back when pinks would run from 5 cents to 5 dollars for no reason on fluff and it didn’t become regulated until shit ton of people lost millions over the years. Just saying im not saying don’t buy but be smart #blockchaintechnology
3792 2018-01-04 19:33:35 I actually think that blockchain is the real story, but blockchain and crypto are completely intertwined and people don't understand it. There are different types of cryptos (all being bought and sold in the same exchanges) that have completely different uses. 1/

3796 2018-01-04 19:33:16 My tron people. I have tron on binance and im new to this crypto game. Should I leave it in binance or should I invest in a wallet? And if a wallet which one is recommended. I also have litecoin, ripple, stellar, poe, cardano and some verge. And a few others.  Decisions.
3797 2018-01-04 19:33:15 Okay obviously you dont wanna answer. Neither would I
So , HW and metamask works for me but I dont know about the private key.
3798 2018-01-04 19:33:07 100% agree - our motto at the RS Innovation Hub is 'people, process and then technology' - and why I find it frustrating everyone is going blockchain/crypto/smart contract crazy with firm events for students without asking 'why?'. So total behind you and thanks for the comment
3799 2018-01-04 19:33:03 how many crypto currencies are there..shit getting hectic
3800 2018-01-04 19:32:59 The whole world is a strange and illogical place. Same goes with the Crypto-market. Sometimes the best thing is to go with the flow.

3802 2018-01-04 19:32:52 This has been the best week ever. Alabama kicked Clemson’s ass. I have an app in the App Store. I’ve tripled my investment in crypto currency, and Alabama plays for the NC Monday. 2018 is looking solid. #rolltide #tron #trx #tron #bitcoin
3803 2018-01-04 19:32:51 Depends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like across all asset classes. 10% is a fine enough guideline but it should be in context of your entire investment portfolio, not just crypto.
3804 2018-01-04 19:32:50 Hey EvilCuppyCakes Crypto thanks for the follow!
3805 2018-01-04 19:32:49 Now they just need to open up Americans able to trade n Crypto without the hooplah Dont leave us behind the Crypto wave is not going away. The blockchain is real and unstoppable. Embrace it dont be last! Lets be first!
3806 2018-01-04 19:32:38 100 JPY(BTC): 1192.698 ~ 1193.614 KRW(BTC)
3807 2018-01-04 19:32:34 Great article. Agree with the sentiment but I'm not against trading it. If one were to buy some Ripple and flip it for a 60% profit in a day to acquire more bitcoin, how is that bad for crypto exactly? More Bitcoin hodling is the end result, good for Bitcoin, no?

3814 2018-01-04 19:32:18 Of course it's a #shitcoin, but dumb money is everywhere in crypto, more so than ever.  Everyone loves a good ol P&D
3815 2018-01-04 19:32:15 Common Conversations at Starbucks:
2016: "Just working on my novel."

3816 2018-01-04 19:32:01 No problem. Crypto’s been good to me.
3817 2018-01-04 19:31:54 I agree with Chris, Reddcoin & Trx are great to start with,also Ripple is a must have for your portfolio now.  Prices move very fast in Crypto.  Get your accounts in order first so when you are ready to buy you won't have to wait 9 days for funds, which is 2 years in crypto time
3818 2018-01-04 19:31:53 I want in.
3819 2018-01-04 19:31:49  2 years only? Thought you said you are confident...
3820 2018-01-04 19:31:47 I went up 50k in a week
 Crypto...where most win and win big!!
3821 2018-01-04 19:31:44 Prediction:   $XRP money moves to $XLM now that CoinBase announced Ripple isn't being added anytime soon.
3822 2018-01-04 19:31:42 XRP is a trash coin and defeats the entire purpose of the crypto movement. Plenty of coins you can make money from in this bull market. Don’t sell your soul and support XRP just to make a profit if you believe in crypto’s future.
3823 2018-01-04 19:31:29 Yah if I were to mess with it, it would be throw away money to put in and forget about. Read up on Peter Thiel and his involvement... he’s super smart and I’d trust his efforts with crypto
3824 2018-01-04 19:31:17 1/2 "Bitcoin is store of value only". Ok, tell me which crypto isn't? Does anyone actually use crypto to pay for things? No. Sure, maybe one day we will, but right now nobody is buying crypto for any other reason but investment, which is exactly why people bought bitcoin anyways.
3825 2018-01-04 19:31:15 you literally COPIED MY tweet???
3826 2018-01-04 19:30:55 I am still not able to see my ardr wallet. I suppose I could have taken them off the exchange but with the shit luck I am having transfering crypto lately it would be lost anyway.
3827 2018-01-04 19:30:54 Not zcash itself, I meant the zk-snarks from an academic crypto tech perspective.
3828 2018-01-04 19:30:43 So a centralized exchange listing a token for a decentralized exchange and competitor. Sure, why not. Wouldn‘t that be smart.
3829 2018-01-04 19:30:34 There is no way or is there that they are that stupid and deaf to what their customers want. Also not adding the #2 crypto is like saying we are not interested in making money. Don't belive a word of and if true investors should pull from @coinbase as returns are not #1 priority
3830 2018-01-04 19:30:29 15$ you are crazy.. 2/3$ prob
3831 2018-01-04 19:30:22 90% of people want to make money in crypto...the other 10% actually does.
3832 2018-01-04 19:30:20 I just read something about mark zuckerberg wants to integrate crypto currency into Facebook. Get ahold of my man asap @justinsuntron that is if u didn't already talk to him

3836 2018-01-04 19:30:10 Selon moi, il est biaisé de calculer la valorisation d'une crypto comme celle d'une entreprise en multipliant le prix unitaire par le nombre de coins. Les coins ne sont pas des actions. De plus, sur ce marché peu mature, la plupart des coins ont été acquis à coût quasi-nul.
3837 2018-01-04 19:30:08 Скорей всено до 4 $ точно пробьет
3838 2018-01-04 19:30:06 Yep. are u using hardware, PV or Metamask to access EDOOOoo?
3839 2018-01-04 19:30:01 @BitGrail 0.05 ETH (47 USD) withdraw fee??
Is this an error? Are there other crypto currencies with lower withdraw fees?
3840 2018-01-04 19:29:55 I literally said to team today that Facebook could sell access to audiences with crypto. Nice
3841 2018-01-04 19:29:54 @SatoshiLite  An all-time low with that condescending tone of yours, considering that you sport both a position of (once) commendable leadership and a history of being an innovator in crypto space.

Some faiths in people are regrettably misplaced.
3842 2018-01-04 19:29:51 This is the dip, when Asia wakes up today and this Crypto Puppies come tomorrow...BOOM
3843 2018-01-04 19:29:45 But that is a gamble when you can't determine the value of the stock or the crypto currency
3844 2018-01-04 19:29:38 $LEND
3845 2018-01-04 19:29:37 The idea anything outside of @Bitcoin in crypto having more value than @Litecoin is laughable. Ethereum has value but people are still asleep to what is about to happen in Litecoin space. 

#Litecoin #ltc #Bitcoin #btc #Ethereum #eth
3846 2018-01-04 19:29:31 If I had that much money in crypto I would absolutely declare publicly that I liquidated all my holdings

3849 2018-01-04 19:29:18 Who are some knowledgeable people that you recommend to follow for crypto?
3850 2018-01-04 19:29:12 Traders in crypto don't sell at desired price, they let it go beyond and then dump all coins suddenly when the tank triggers
3851 2018-01-04 19:29:10 Listen, 1. you have no idea who Satoshi is
2. China is mining most of the bitcoins 3. You need the internet to use crypto 4. The internet is not yours! 5. The idea is to get you to believe you're are being freed while the chains only tighten

I think YOU need to do some research
3852 2018-01-04 19:29:10 Hello #Nexium. Finally made that move. If you are playing it... hold until 11000 or 12000 area. Should be a good spot to sell.

3853 2018-01-04 19:29:08 Kind of perversely glad even old hands at crypto do this. I put a tiny bit of money into $CPAY just a few days ago, figuring since it was a working business it could go up. The coin I gave up to do it went screaming up... and here I sit, trying to hold and grinding my teeth.
3854 2018-01-04 19:29:00 trying to learn to fish...we are now in wave iv of 3 then v of 3?  Will iv of 3 be deep or should we wait for wave 4 correction?
3855 2018-01-04 19:28:56 Of course, there friends on Wall Street are getting upset that people are leaving equities for crypto.
3856 2018-01-04 19:28:49 Haha, I had a feeling you would say that. I did find out a domestic crypto ticket exchange doesn’t exist. Want to launch an ICO?
3857 2018-01-04 19:28:41 He sold them so he would not be accused of being a thief. Do you think cryptos are going to return to all people without anyone leaving cheated? Stop living in Wonderland. Most of the crypto were created with the objective of collecting funds and not for operation.

3859 2018-01-04 19:28:39 For someone who says they're trading Crypto to secure a better education for your sibling, you gloating at one currency falling seems a tad out of place. I hope you feel better after letting your hate out.
3860 2018-01-04 19:28:38 wow... ok.
3861 2018-01-04 19:28:34 not going to jump back just wanna know if it was a good move or not
3862 2018-01-04 19:28:28 He’s the biggest crypto advocate around
3863 2018-01-04 19:28:25 Hopefully the real anarchocapitalist crypto tribe is only along for a short term ride and will dump with profits. I won't trade XRP out of principal, but if we could teach them a lesson by coordinated dumping, that would be fine with me.

3870 2018-01-04 19:28:00 Hey... thanks for adding Bitcoin Cash, the rotten apple of crypto trying to manipulate and steal from the good cause (Bitcoin). With your track record.. I'm sure the next coin you'll add is Ripple
3871 2018-01-04 19:27:59 Just so that noobs like you can pretend that they’ve invested in a genuine decentralised crypto with a limited, mineable supply?

3874 2018-01-04 19:27:52 Putting this on the record now. Zuckerberg mentioned how he is interested in studying how FB could use crypto in their services. I predict there will be a FB coin in the not too distant future which will be used for FB platforms purchases - ads, user purchases, etc.
3875 2018-01-04 19:27:47 @PowerHasheur @CryptoAnalyseFr Hey, vos vidéos m'ont donné envie de mettre de l'argent dans les crypto-monnaies $omg et $btc pour commencer, ou puis-je me rendre? Bittrex à fermer ses inscriptions et Binance aussi, je n'en connais pas d'autre fiable...

3889 2018-01-04 19:26:18 Altcoins is the way but if you already are on cb just go with gdax and transfer all your crypto and money on gdax for free then you can trade for less fees or no fees if your have a bid or ask. And withdrawals are free I tested it and sent like 20 bucks worth of btc to a ledger s
3890 2018-01-04 19:26:18 Litecoin has arguably been the most stable crypto the last few weeks... isn't that what merchants want in a coin so they know exactly what the value they're getting is??? Just a little thought.
3891 2018-01-04 19:26:14 Once the masses begin to understand financial sovereignty (i.e. monetary legitimacy) then the Genie has been let out of the bottle. #BTC (or even #crypto) could be stopped, but another kind of decentralized currency would appear.
3892 2018-01-04 19:26:13 Exactly! It has huge potential and it's not even on a major exchange. Make sure you load your bags BEFORE it hits Binance or Bittrex.

3896 2018-01-04 19:25:51 Yesir. Bitcoin is the largest crypto right now market cap wise but there are many others out there. Buy/sell/trade of cryptos right now is skyrocketing. It's a large and interesting market to learn and understand.
3897 2018-01-04 19:25:44 Amazing!
3898 2018-01-04 19:25:40 I see a lot of salty people recently due to missed pumps. Guys, be grateful with whatever you have, life is way more than just $$$, moon, and lambos. Sit down and think, you already have so much more than others. $crypto

3900 2018-01-04 19:25:31 Getting well involved in the old crypto currencies. #ThisTimeNextYearWellBeMillionairs
3901 2018-01-04 19:25:30 Yeah, I wonder if there's someone at the company who's wanted to do a cash-back program for years, and it's only getting off the ground because of crypto.
3902 2018-01-04 19:25:30 This industry is just too great for me to sit on the sidelines and work 9 to 5. I would love to be an integral part of the crypto community. I bought Bitcoin back at $5 I bought 20 of them but had no idea what they were for just buying off the speculation at the time.
3903 2018-01-04 19:25:27 It is shocking especially given the crypto madness. People are willing to remain in denial far longer than you would think.
3904 2018-01-04 19:25:23 Everyone’s a crypto currency guru now
3905 2018-01-04 19:25:18 people like to bitch about being pre mined but i dont see the problem, if they are actually using the funds for development.
3906 2018-01-04 19:25:18 Hope your #crypto holdings have crushed it!!!
3907 2018-01-04 19:25:14 they both will ‘win’. their blockchains do different things - plenty of room for both - though, the crypto purists will hate xrp on principle...which i can understand
3908 2018-01-04 19:25:13 @CHalexov2016 I saw you liked my tweet. Wanted to say thanks and that I love your page! Nice lambo! Would you mind retweeting my blockfolio funny meme?
3909 2018-01-04 19:25:12 Love this sentiment!  All that have made a ton on crypto, dont forget the real world.  Buy property, invest in solar. Long term wealth building that also connects you to community
3910 2018-01-04 19:25:11 I said it i sAid it!!  lets go!!
3911 2018-01-04 19:25:09 Had the same issue.  Went back into binance and saw the amounts returned to the available balances. Reinitiated the withdrawals and they went through fine.
3912 2018-01-04 19:25:06 Any time. Feel free to message or @ me if you have questions. Crypto is the wild Wild West right now. Lots of danger and growth.

obvs about legal and whatnot of crypto
3916 2018-01-04 19:24:45 It’s undervalued for a reason. It is an amateur freak show and the end product will not provide confidence enough for many investors that saw that shit unfold. They need and experienced and recognised front man to deliver the msg
3917 2018-01-04 19:24:43 @dentcoin
3918 2018-01-04 19:24:39 None of what I said was talking about BTC price. U said it didn't matter, it does for this crypto space. Your reply tweet was worthless and off topic. Atomic swaps will make exchanges useless down the road. To think otherwise is completely ignorant. What's the best troll comment?
3919 2018-01-04 19:24:38 The future is crypto, if we could have more outlets that accepts crypto currency as payment, then we can override the system of conventional means of payment #Ethereum #ETH #BTC #bitcoin #BitcoinTalk #altcoin #altcoins #Litecoin #LTC #Crypto #CryptoCoinsNews

3926 2018-01-04 19:24:06 fact: the smart money bought #Crypto and didn't waste a second pontificating on #blockchain ...
3927 2018-01-04 19:24:02 $ETH broke a $1000 today, beautiful stuff, $ETC starting to make a move following $ETH as expected. $DGB finally breaking out. etc. etc. #HODL because #altparty continues
3928 2018-01-04 19:24:02 Get lucky on a crypto, wear a suit and tie or happy, cool go lucky attire, start a YouTube channel and your an expert on Crypto investments?

Wrong, most seem to actually know very little or nothing about Bitcoin, Crypto, Blockchain or why society needs it.

Be careful out there!
3929 2018-01-04 19:23:49 Be honest with yourselves, you have no clue what you are buying or what it is worth. Recipe for disaster. #crypto #cryptotrader
3930 2018-01-04 19:23:48 That's an easy one... if everyone keeps exchanging BTC to XRP then XRP becomes the top crypto and overtakes bitcoins market cap.
3931 2018-01-04 19:23:47 Very sound article @CryptoYoda1338, nothing of sensation, the misguided greed that is fuelling the opposite of crypto values is so clear to see 
3932 2018-01-04 19:23:40 Scam scam scam
3933 2018-01-04 19:23:39 People seriously need to research what they are buying into. A true crypto currency is not a company and should have no single point of weakness, CEO, server or software. This can only be done with decentralised open source software! Otherwise it's just the e-tokens of the 90's!
3934 2018-01-04 19:23:32 $cssi has 100% ownership in a #cryptocurrency exchange that launches in less than 30 days. Plus 300 crypto atms in casinos in latin america. Just hired new COO with experience in Korea #XRP #bitcoin #btc #ltc #xvg

3937 2018-01-04 19:23:22 Man Charlie the entire market is going up and ltc is moving the opposite direction. I bought high because I got introduced to crypto late in the game. But I really believe in ltc and I'm holding. But we need u to get back in it. Steve jobs would never leave Apple.
3938 2018-01-04 19:23:20 Bittrex

3940 2018-01-04 19:23:11 Good call indeed
3941 2018-01-04 19:23:11 That just means it's going to pump harder than anything else has at this point.

Who the fuck reads book anymore? Fucking nerds. I should’ve put that money into $ZCL
3944 2018-01-04 19:22:54 One of the reasons i can't see myself getting into crypto (besides lack of funds) is how stupidly volatile the market is

One person with enough influence can change the worth of an entire currency through their mentions of it

That is waayyyy too volatile.
3945 2018-01-04 19:22:53 Picked up #TRX at .08 yesterday. Am I hustler now? Am I a big, throbbing member of the #Crypto community now?
3946 2018-01-04 19:22:52 The Ripple bubble or the crypto bubble?
3947 2018-01-04 19:22:49 Thanks for speaking out @CryptoYoda1338 .Ripple is scaring me. The Crypto masses are perfect victims for Ripple! :(
3948 2018-01-04 19:22:38 the crypto i want to invest in but am afraid to is currently blowing up. back to the drawing board
3949 2018-01-04 19:22:35 Stop calling Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core" I feel offended by that REEEEEE. God I wish you could just vanish nowadays, what a great crypto world that'd be.

3953 2018-01-04 19:22:24 So in basic terms you send your Coins from your wallets on your exchanges to your wallets on your ledger nano s  ?
3954 2018-01-04 19:22:20 Like it would be nice when ltc and btc join together on the same network, and within payments you can swap between them. Making it more conveinient for stores to accept crypto payments  #atomicswap #LightningNetwork
3955 2018-01-04 19:22:19 Crypto paraya çevir istediğin yere götür olmazmı
3956 2018-01-04 19:22:16 @crypto_sarah9 anyone comparing PIVX or Monero to the privacy @vergecurrency provides is not doing their homework!

3958 2018-01-04 19:22:08 Mining Bitcoin for example and many other currencies is starting to get ridiculous. Crypto needs to get environment friendly as a whole. #pivx is already on that train!

3963 2018-01-04 19:21:49 Bch is hookers shop LOL
3964 2018-01-04 19:21:32 Then please explain to me where and how I ever defrauded anyone. If anything, I've been pointing out potential fraud, particularly in the crypto ecosystem.
3965 2018-01-04 19:21:28 It did have quite a pump but also quite a correction unlike most of the top cryptos these days
3966 2018-01-04 19:21:27 
3967 2018-01-04 19:21:16 Which platform?
3968 2018-01-04 19:21:13 Here’s a #BTC #Bitcoin thought.. are we seeing stability in the price of #BTC at $15000 - which will now allow the #CRYPTO world to get the #baseCURRENCY / #StoreOFvalue stability we all crave.. or does everyone still thinking #BTC to $100k in 2018 
3969 2018-01-04 19:21:12 For sure #IOTA is a coin that belongs in Top10, I'm expecting it to make big moves soon. IT definitely has a potential to cross $20B market.
3970 2018-01-04 19:21:06 A monster red day is coming. I believe #crypto is the future. However there is no reason for this many tokens/currencies that have no "current" use case to have multibillion dollar marketcaps..

3971 2018-01-04 19:21:05 When do we get to the part about how crypto tools and generated wealth will be used to better the world and solve problems?  haven;t heard a peep yet.
3972 2018-01-04 19:21:04 Absolutely. I get bad vibes from Ver. Got some BCash coins dumped in my wallet and don't even know what to do with them (I've only been into crypto for 7 months.)
3973 2018-01-04 19:21:02 
3974 2018-01-04 19:21:01 I was new to crypto when I found Embermine. They never made me feel silly for asking a question, or stupid for not knowing anything. They have a low tolerance for the shitty stuff some people like to say online, which I wish there was more of in this world.
3975 2018-01-04 19:21:01 I think you have not done enough study to understand how the price of the crypto is decided.
For your information is not decided by koinex it's decided by the people who trade that is we people.
So please don't give wrong statements.
3976 2018-01-04 19:20:57 I see $gvt is flying. Probably has to do with the less than 4 million available coins.

Thanks @CharlieShrem.  You’re a great advisor!

4005 2018-01-04 19:18:41 Stop saying it takes minutes to transfer. It takes 4 seconds for XRP to transfer. Maybe you should act upon your own words and "do some research".
4006 2018-01-04 19:18:40 Just like any other investment, don't invest what you can't afford to lose. I'll be fine if crypto crashes to 0.

4008 2018-01-04 19:18:26 The day @RobinhoodApp gets in the crypto game is the day that crypto really goes to the moon.
4009 2018-01-04 19:18:25 Thinking back on my trading days at Merrill, I see a pattern emerging soon:  Expect a hard correction on crypto assets to shake out the weak hands only to see it move to higher highs after the selloff.
4010 2018-01-04 19:18:17 I think 90% of the people in crypto want to make money.  Charlie crashed $LTC by selling his whales share and has done nothing to restore confidence. Even if his intentions were good, the result has been a disaster.

4039 2018-01-04 19:16:26 Npm for sure needs to do a scan if possible. CDNs as wel. It’s just too easy. My biggest fear is how many attempts already are going on. One can’t even do said test without being physically cordoned off bare metal. I also think of all the crypto currency exchanges...

4048 2018-01-04 19:15:30 Justin's response was warranted.  Charlie has been unbearable for months. Horrible face for a crypto. If you're in it for money (which, let's face it...most of us are), I would get out.  Whatever $LTC has going for it is offset by his horrible online persona

4071 2018-01-04 19:13:48 that's kind of a question I've had about btc and crypto in general -- is there some way of estimating shrinkage?
4072 2018-01-04 19:13:41 Im sure you'd be talking a different narrative if you had bought heavy at $0.03 ...
4073 2018-01-04 19:13:29 It seems it would have been best if @vergecurrency and @justinvendetta had an official announcement regarding the #WraithProtocol release. 

They said it would be released before Dec 31 at midnight EST. And *everyone* in crypto was watching.

"Where's Wraith?" said everyone.

4079 2018-01-04 19:13:20 I think I've seen enough shady crypto projects pump and deflate over the past 5 years to be able to estimate the extremely low likelihood of that. But keep drinking the kool-aid. The facts and metrics work against you though.
4080 2018-01-04 19:13:12 Absolutely! Writing for beginners is one of my focuses. I'm glad someone is doing it.

4084 2018-01-04 19:12:56 That’s ok, we all start there then we evolve and see the bigger picture the real meaning of crypto which is much more than a bunch of dollars.
You will ge there one day, took me a while myself but once I saw it I understood much more about crypto and the world.
Happy trading.

4086 2018-01-04 19:12:53 For people wondering, specifically, in New York, a crypto-currency provider has to receive certification to be allowed to operate in NY. This statement basically says, “any US state might randomly up and decide to force us to regulatory compliance, and we won’t do it.”

4109 2018-01-04 19:11:27 And Litecoin tech seems better than Bitcoin tech so I'm thinking that's the one that will be good to have when the world starts buying in crypto.
4110 2018-01-04 19:11:27 1/1. In the crypto world, Bitcoin is perceived as slow to change, clunky technologically, and as having bad governance. While true, Bitcoin has strong network effects that will maintain its status as the primary value store in the short to medium term.#BitcoinNetworkEffects

4138 2018-01-04 19:09:48 There needs to be a new word for a kind of "reverse schadenfreude". It's the feeling of superiority I have over all the gullible losers investing in worthless crypto, while they make millions in the process and I don't.
4139 2018-01-04 19:09:46 Why??? Is that a bad thing?

4146 2018-01-04 19:09:24 Big difference v social networks though; the orgs/people who are most negatively affected by success of crypto currencies know about it already and are spending a shitload of money and effort spreading FUD in the hope it dies.
4147 2018-01-04 19:09:23 Coinbase is garbage?  Not a very fair statement to make, when It's probably the biggest and best entry point to cryptocurrency in the world.  Without it, crypto would not be at all approachable by the mainstream.  Don't let politics pervert your judgement.

4156 2018-01-04 19:09:00 Hey this is great! Thanks a ton.
4157 2018-01-04 19:08:56 I think that people in crypto are naively assuming that "market cap" in crypto is equivalent to its meaning in equities. I've seen crypto people say it means the amount of fiat invested in a crypto (it really doesn't) or that it's value metric (it isn't).
4158 2018-01-04 19:08:53 1. Ripple crypto paralardan çok farklı bir teknoloji ve amaca sahip para. 100 milyar token olmasından dolayı fiyatı çok uzun zamanda ancak 20-30 doları bulur ama en azından spekülasyondan biraz uzak ve geleceği olan bir para. Diyanet her coin için ayrı yorum yapmalı: çok önemli

4167 2018-01-04 19:08:29 I like to see CEO like @justinsuntron consistently update investors with information. It shows a lot of leadership and i do believe in this crypto.
4168 2018-01-04 19:08:23 Can't we just remove Ripple $XRP from CoinMarketCap and all crypto exchanges and stop pretending that it's a cryptocurrency even comparable to Bitcoin? It's an enterprise payment network. Put it in a basket with Visa/Maastercard/PayPal and be done with it.
4169 2018-01-04 19:08:20 Also I wrote $alco instead $alqo
Maybe I have to go back home...
4170 2018-01-04 19:08:20 Dumbest article I’ve ever read. Literally every single crypto currency has seen volatile swings like this and xrb has recovered nicely from its sell off. Which was strictly people taking profits lol. Some people are just dumb smh

4180 2018-01-04 19:07:57 Crypto was mentioned but nothing was said about it being decentralised.
4181 2018-01-04 19:07:57 Actually I take some of my profits to put them into some undervalued coins with lower market cap. We will face a general increase in overall market cap in 2018. That means that everything with some potential will rise. And those little ones are more profitable. #altcoins #crypto
4182 2018-01-04 19:07:39 Is it 100% safe,,?? Undervalued is slightly overstated with a marketcapp 2.5 Billion.. What do you think #bitcoinPrivate? When you buy #ZCL (Zclassic) You will get 1:1 free Bitcoin Private when the fork (end January) will take place. Thoughts?

4199 2018-01-04 19:06:34 when will you make a call for $sys 
4200 2018-01-04 19:06:30 The biggest sector to rise in crypto is crypto payment cards like $PAY, $MCO etc.

People getting into crypto don't give a fuck about 'privacy' imo. They're not here for 'anonymity', their here for GAINS. 

When they get gains, what do you think they want to do?

SPEND IT.

4251 2018-01-04 19:02:48 There’s no such thing as bitcoin vs altcoins.
It’s crypto vs Fiat.
Let’s not lose our sight of the real goal here, Bitcoin open the door and it’s holding it open while alts get in and disrupt everything.
Bitcoin is the hero.
4252 2018-01-04 19:02:41 @Crypto_Truth It almost seems like #BTC was a warm-up act for #XRP
4253 2018-01-04 19:02:40 If you want to use this analogy with crypto it is more like the shiny money pit draws people in. They get some and lose some and walk out the other side to realize that "money" has nothing to do with it really. It's is all about #memes #community. Money is an illusion
4254 2018-01-04 19:02:35 Neither of these methods really apply to crypto since cryptocurrencies don't produce a revenue/earnings stream and there is no method to "value" an exchange rate.
4255 2018-01-04 19:02:32 Yeah look into the Russians buying were comeys friends.

Selling my @binance_2017 account for 100 BTC. Verified to tier 2. 

I'll let me @BittrexExchange account go for 75 BTC. 

I'll even leave my shittest bags in there for you as a 'welcome to crypto' bonus.

4334 2018-01-04 18:59:10 Concept: Crypto currencies becoming so mainstream the banks are actually in trouble and scared shitless within my lifetime
4335 2018-01-04 18:59:09 I was wondering about that -- honestly what has kept me out of crypto over past few yrs is so hard to tell whether you put coins on an exchange to trade & whether you'd be fee'd up the wazoo / not be able to get liquidity before a huge price drop. You did well though!

4352 2018-01-04 18:58:00 Please remember that market cap for crypto assets is an easily manipulated metric and not really an accurate measure of value as it would be for something like a publicly traded security.
Be extremely cautious.
4353 2018-01-04 18:57:58 No shitcoins
4354 2018-01-04 18:57:53 The whole market? 

Definitely not.

Are certain coins likely ponzi schemes/scams, possibly. 

Crypto as a whole likely has a great future.
4355 2018-01-04 18:57:46 Trump said 30,000, they will push it to 30000 by end of 2018, than maybe and hopefully the wheels will start to come off in late 2019. Actually, I think many crypto currencies right now despite the hype are little less risky than the stock market.

4372 2018-01-04 18:56:21 So, you should be patient in that case, becuz bitcoin effect is temp. never sell into panic and patience is the key of success in crypto. it's the hardest part of crypto.
Stop loss is the another option you can use when btc makes a move. but personally i never use that.

4459 2018-01-04 18:51:04 Thats still 3.5x bro,  crypto is where it's at.  I'm late to party but luckily was early on tron
4460 2018-01-04 18:51:02 First of all, monkeys like smooth Jazz not crypto currency experts
4461 2018-01-04 18:50:58 Do the opposite of what I'm doing and you'll live a long life lol
4462 2018-01-04 18:50:57 This Crypto currency has all my attention. Lol
4463 2018-01-04 18:50:49 Sarah, only a month in but have your top 3 through my research, makes me feel good I am seeing proper opportunity :) haha any exhanges you recommend? @crypto_sarah9
4464 2018-01-04 18:50:43 New year! New opportunities! Lots of people are very cautious about new hype on market as a crypto currency. What do you think about it? I am convinced about landing of bitcoins using #bitconnect. Wanna follow me and see my success or failure? Let’s go then

4468 2018-01-04 18:50:21 No matter what happens this is good for the investor, more publicity and fuel to the already raging fire in the crypto space.
4469 2018-01-04 18:50:19 as a product how much ripple inc. worth? (more than applepay?) - it pretends to be crypto - scam

idea behind crypto is to promote an open source world, with more privacy, yet more democratic + less open to corruption & manipulation

xrp has the potential to make 1984 a reality..
4470 2018-01-04 18:50:12 @crypto_no_flair @CollinCrypto @cryptopicasso @FatihSK87 @FatihSK87 @CryptoYoda1338 this is amazing

4485 2018-01-04 18:49:04 Get some good doctors for your brain for your „speculation“ comment. Ripple is backed by banks like SBI.

4488 2018-01-04 18:48:49 From Streamer to Financial Planner?  This crypto currency makes me nervous.  I feel like it is going to go bust.
4489 2018-01-04 18:48:45 so the worst crypto exchange #palmex still has not resolved my issues. Yes, if you decided to use this exchange your funds will be stuck for over a week EVERY TIME. #JibrelNetwork operates under the same scammy umbrella and are not to be trusted. Message me for more details.

4500 2018-01-04 18:48:17 I think you missed the point of decentralisation on which this whole crypto environment was originally established.
4501 2018-01-04 18:48:11 As a drop out self taught in crypto, web development, and writing I totally agree with you on schooling. Also very impressed with your contributions to the space. Looking forward to diving into your published works and applying.

4507 2018-01-04 18:47:57 Crypto is different, the more people who know and buy in the higher the value. You want to be telling everyone your secrets

4525 2018-01-04 18:46:47 Crypto Kitties have definitely demonstrated that there is an appetite for playful speculation. Whether it is desirable depends on what the community wants Ethereum to become.
4526 2018-01-04 18:46:46 Only $1 right now. Still a good buy I’m assuming?

4541 2018-01-04 18:45:53 Gentlemen you both are distinguished individuals in an emerging industry that is in its infancy. We all need to be progressing together not bickering on who's who/what.

4546 2018-01-04 18:45:40 Did the Net Neutrality bill happen to curb this Crypto currency wave?! Interesting thought
4547 2018-01-04 18:45:39 PUD raising rates every 6 months, for not using electric enough and now for using to much "Crypto Miner's" plus $40 service fee. Many will have to shut off soon. Non profit org and city/support homeless squatting on private prop, city fining owners, city wants land for park.
4548 2018-01-04 18:45:29 Tip of the day... If you aren't day trading your #crypto, take them off the exchange and use a hardware wallet. Not only will that keep them safe when an exchange goes down for maintenance, but it will save you from impulsively trading! I recommend the #ledger nano S..
4549 2018-01-04 18:45:26 @RossLloyd_za Thanks for sharing, Ross! Have a fantastic crypto day! 
4550 2018-01-04 18:45:25 Hey, we all have free speech in this country. Doesn’t mean you’re invincible to criticism. You want to promote Pepe and “crypto-nationalism” (which in itself belies a serious misunderstanding of Bitcoin), I hope you do so. To your heart’s content.

Thank being said, I own none 
4564 2018-01-04 18:44:44 Ugh. Been waiting for my ETH to transfer for 1 1/2 hours, (still pending) I thought crypto was fast. WTF....Binance is cost us money.
4565 2018-01-04 18:44:44 I made $60 into almost $500 on these crypto currencies. IDK how y’all do that 9-5 shit.
4566 2018-01-04 18:44:43 In most cases but sometimes it's a necessity, i.e. when a coin is a scam, like BitConnect. It's a duty to tell it as it is no matter what.
4567 2018-01-04 18:44:41 There is no way BTC is the only solution to the only problem. Rather crypto in general solves a ton of issues. 
That means diversify your BTC into alts and hold through extreme volatility all the way to the moon.
4568 2018-01-04 18:44:35 Nice tat, but the watch intrigues me more. Is that the Classic Fusion?
4569 2018-01-04 18:44:32 Well its in our name :) Thou you cant get many. Small batch released every day in 2018. Price increases 2.7% daily.

4572 2018-01-04 18:44:28 btc will eat ALL other altcoin very soon the monster will come back and  will show who is the boss of crypto!!!
4573 2018-01-04 18:44:26 1000 coins are the future
Crypto is the future and there are different projects, incentives, at the end what matters is that we change the financial system together instead of fighting which coin we s better, we must see the great picture here.
Ltc > trx for what’s done in crypto
4574 2018-01-04 18:44:26 @BlockfolioApp You guy's made a great app and the general interest in #Crypto is not only affecting you guys. Stay frosty and good luck.

4576 2018-01-04 18:44:22 Why are you not allowing me to withdraw? You have not sent me my withdraw confirmation email in 4 hours.
4577 2018-01-04 18:44:20 TRX had gotten for target 1. Where to from here?
4578 2018-01-04 18:44:17 I also bought BTC on Mt.Gox soooo Ive never had this much fun with crypto.
4579 2018-01-04 18:44:16 It’s has no place in the crypto market (neither do 99%) but I guess it’s functional so bankers can join the fun! Ohh forgot, Dimon was already in at 3000 level on BTC  silly me
4580 2018-01-04 18:44:11 It’s all the new people in crypto purchasing these coins like tron and ripple. Techinically does that add value yes but it’s being added to coins that can’t hit more then a few dollars due too high supply but these people think it’s gonna hit bitcoin price which can’t happen
4581 2018-01-04 18:44:06 You are the best man, love followin you
4582 2018-01-04 18:43:56 a atfs is a very nice and great project where we get more crypto coins

4586 2018-01-04 18:43:33 Several #altcoins have over a $1 billion in market cap and no working product?  And ya’ll mad at @vergecurrency for being a few hours late with #WraithProtocol?

4588 2018-01-04 18:43:22 Another reason for dumping is that Binance disabled new registration. So noobs can't get into the pump atm. #trx #tron Be aware of that! #crypto #cryptocurrency
4589 2018-01-04 18:43:15 Again I'm of the mind set of "wait and see" but i have personally always believe that XLM is way undervalued "my personal opinion"  But with that said "Big Movement=Big Corrections small Movements=Small Corrections"  diversification is a must!

4596 2018-01-04 18:42:42 Charlie you had no incentive to sell LTC for 6 years as crypto wasn't famous and will not have given any value anyway !! But as soon as you got value and you sold all your exposure. #Selfish  !!!

4605 2018-01-04 18:42:10 I would like to officially announce that @mattfuka and I will be launching our own Crypto Currency soon... #DaddyCoin
4606 2018-01-04 18:42:09 You can wallet to wallet now, but financial institutions will be the ones driving global adoption of crypto in everyday transactions. Banks adopt for cost savings on overheard with attractive features (speed, fraud protect) Banks incentivize businesses who incentivize consumers.
4607 2018-01-04 18:42:08 Everyone on here should get into Crypto Currencies. It is the future and there no better time to invest now into it
4608 2018-01-04 18:42:07 Also RSI is showing bullish divergence

4617 2018-01-04 18:41:52 I *literally* hate the use of cyber and crypto. They are awful and silly. I can't fathom where it came from and language changing to fit your needs is facetious.

If you have any subjects you would like me to touch on, let me know.
4621 2018-01-04 18:41:47 Hey rand, on quadriga we only have btc, eth, ltc, bch, btg to choose from, at this moment, who do you see out of those to do the greatest returns?
4622 2018-01-04 18:41:41 He didn't have a choice to sell it before 6 years anyway as he will not have achieved that value as crypto were not that popular. As soon as LTC went up . . He sold leaving investors high and dry
4623 2018-01-04 18:41:37 Well to there defence... They haven't hit a 1000 yet....
4624 2018-01-04 18:41:35 Would think an ICO PR could be coming anytime from $SRAX. Still trading in nice range last few weeks, ready for a pop. Could be nice timing if $CNET sets fire to some crypto names again
4625 2018-01-04 18:41:35 Ppl think they have the social media power to talk a coin out of existence. They'll learn what they say doesn't mean shit anymore in crypto. XRP was a brilliant concept from day 1. I was shilling that shit hard!

4636 2018-01-04 18:41:09 It'll always be like that.  VEN, NEO, etc. will probably see an increase when China inevitably lifts it's crypto exchange ban.

4672 2018-01-04 18:38:35 Crypto in general will explode... because... everyone knows... before getting in altcoins, people will buy or get in to btc first usually. Its gonna be a massive surge for everything crypto!

4681 2018-01-04 18:38:14 Get into that crypto lol

4688 2018-01-04 18:37:51 Bro the thing with crypto is that you can sell and buy and donate anything anywhere anytime
4689 2018-01-04 18:37:50 Finally someone said it.  So many people don't get it.  Litecoin isn't just a token.  It's a currency.  How many true curriencies are within crypto?  Litecoin will be huge.
4690 2018-01-04 18:37:50 Avoid cryptocurrencies. Few can predict regular currency movements forget crypto. Anything without economic value is speculative. Good investing requires discipline, knowledge & good temperament. With crypto, none of these qualities can be applied with confidence .

4711 2018-01-04 18:35:56 Sounds about right. I like crypto as the best ROI vehicle available today. This is a game changer that people will in the future see as being normal. And with the accelerated way that things move in the tech space - Norms are being formed and reformed fast. Great space.

4721 2018-01-04 18:35:07 Charlie Lee you abandoned litecoin! You don't have the right to respond. Now I respect you as being one of the most influential in Crypto but alot of people believed in you and litecoin to be a speaker for it but in the end just ditched us

4754 2018-01-04 18:33:16 $XRP conspiracy theories that have been driving me crazy this week: 

1) XRP is a devious plan by the banks to take over crypto!

2) Banks never actually use XRP!

Both cannot be true, however it's entirely possible that both theories are false.

4790 2018-01-04 18:31:13 The hardest part of crypto buying and trading is telling when to sell to buy on a dip. A few of my sell points became the new dip.  Didn't lose anything but damn its frustrating.

4796 2018-01-04 18:31:01 Think there is a potential for more disruption in the financial space for someone to take crypto and make it portfolio available for the average investor. We all know that large finance investment is linked to pension funds and unit trusts. Just need to put some nice wrappers on!
4797 2018-01-04 18:30:58 After all the extreme "learning-from-mistakes" losses early on in my crypto career I've finally withdrawn my original stake and sitting pretty on 500% of that!

4907 2018-01-04 18:24:56 hijack to crypto. As a crypto investor you're sad unless you make 100x return per year. There are 20y old kids who shoot for millions $ ICO as a angel/seed stage. That is some shift in thinking
4908 2018-01-04 18:24:55 $smart, $buzz
4909 2018-01-04 18:24:54 The value perception in #Crypto is wrong.

Investors look at #Bitcoin and say "That's high, it's $15000"
Investors look at @Ripple and say "That's low, it's at $3.50"

This works until it doesn't.

I encourage people to do research. Learn about teams, governance and product.

5037 2018-01-04 18:16:28 So you can apply the principles of trend analysis over to crypto but not the principles of diversification?  And almost every alt is faster and has lower transaction fees than Bitcoin and the energy required to mine BTC is a huge turn-off for many people.
5038 2018-01-04 18:16:25 amateur.... crypto isn't for you my friend - a little way over your head. go back to your daily grind. also, here's another new word for you - research - that'll keep you busy for a while.

5042 2018-01-04 18:16:07 The upside potential is amazing!  It's goal is to be the facebook if crypto and offer it's own currency to use in their own social media platform called pacfyle.  Launching soon!

5052 2018-01-04 18:15:38 So far my Crypto currency is up $120. But I can't sell it. This is fucked
5053 2018-01-04 18:15:38  Crypto reddit’s and telegrams are sick of seeing y’all post “hodl” “lambo” and “moon”
5054 2018-01-04 18:15:32 To be fair. Crypto currency can be a good thing, but it should be regulated.

5059 2018-01-04 18:15:20 Can you make an update on xvg @Haejin_Crypto
5060 2018-01-04 18:15:09 I could only imagine trading crypto in Costa Rica .. making money on vacation 
5061 2018-01-04 18:15:09 Ha!  Had to look up "FUD"    
Like everything else, the herd's stampede has to pass through.  What amazes me as an outsider to the crypto game is how little I hear people talking about how we can use these new tools, methods, and wealth to improve the world and solve problems.

5063 2018-01-04 18:15:02 Average joes don't like bitcoin? And most average people are going to invest in something the banks are behind rather than decentralization. I'm not with it or against it, Crypto is much more than that. Right now I'm in it to make money. And if u aren't than your doing it wrong.
5064 2018-01-04 18:14:59 @realDonaldTrump you will single-handedly allow the decimation of the entire planet's ecosystems. fuck you.

5067 2018-01-04 18:14:49 These "hints" i've been seeing everywhere are coming from people who've been "trading" crypto for MAYBE 2 months lol.
5068 2018-01-04 18:14:33 Currently digging down into my past and hopefully found an abandoned crypto wallet with some balance inside 
5069 2018-01-04 18:14:25 If this petgame, which Tronix going to release, be similar as the Ethereum Game Cryptokitties we will see a huge Jump. I am expecting a price btw 3000-4000 sats for next week.

5072 2018-01-04 18:14:23 Nah, KuCoin is offline.
5073 2018-01-04 18:14:22 Looks like it’s been announced now as expected Jan 24, so you should be good for a bit.
5074 2018-01-04 18:14:17 What are you daytrading, crypto?
5075 2018-01-04 18:14:16 every cheap crypto is worth to buy! You have just to Hold for some time!!!
I have less than 1 month in crypto and i have turned 500$ to 5000$ just with cheap cryptos!
:)
5076 2018-01-04 18:14:13 They aren't replacing any cash or crypto. If I want to pay you 100 USD but you want to recieve payment in EUR, I can utilize the speed/cost of XRP by sending you $100 of XRP and have that payment hit your account instantly in the corresponding EUR value.
5077 2018-01-04 18:14:11 Like platform or crypto?
5078 2018-01-04 18:14:10 Personal opinion, I'd agree with that. A challenge for the global crypto community will be deciding on an actual definition for decentralized. What percentage of ownership must be spread across how many thousands (millions?) of people? Have we even gotten close?
5079 2018-01-04 18:14:05 Crypto needs a trustable, unbiased resource that has a summary of various coins. How coins are generated, who the development team is, what it’s based off, what features set it apart from other coins ect.
5080 2018-01-04 18:14:03 Well if turning $10 into $1000 excites you more than turning $20,000 into $120,000, than I would suggest you dig deeper into the concept of risk vs. reward. Fundamentals of investing there.

Perhaps you should re-evaluate your investment horizon or raise your expectations.
5081 2018-01-04 18:14:02 More money for the people who know what their doing tbh... but it does hurt the future of crypto...
5082 2018-01-04 18:13:55 Foolish to think He didnt reinvest in crypto
5083 2018-01-04 18:13:52 Seriously, You know for it to even hit $100 the MCAP of crypto would have to be $3,480,015,532,005.18USD. Let alone it has no use for the general public and is designed specifically for the banks. There are FAR better investments.

5092 2018-01-04 18:13:10 What you think about btc
5093 2018-01-04 18:13:06 Its probably painful for some of these reporters to write daily news that a #crypto went 5X 10X 100X and knowing the fact that noobs who just got in are making money while they themselves could have made a lot of money but did not get in, they are just bitter.
5094 2018-01-04 18:12:57 What good is our billions of $ if we don't use some of it to expand our arsenal to fight this evident threat? The crypto community has what they want, everything but the mob influence really. How do we foster a greater influence to stop this before it happens?
5095 2018-01-04 18:12:53 Is there any resource you could point me towards in setting up a masternode? How do you know how many coins you need for each coins' masternodes?
Thanks for any help by the way, really appreciated.
5096 2018-01-04 18:12:53 It's 5k ?

5109 2018-01-04 18:12:12 Absolutely @blognetworkers. If anything it’s cryptography that will fuel the approaching technological revolution.

5110 2018-01-04 18:12:11 There’s other kinds of crypto currency. Y’all better hop on them. And no it’s not litecoin bitcoin or etherium
5111 2018-01-04 18:12:08 Nereden nereye yaptığın önemli Türk borsalarından yabancı borsaya transfer eth veya ltc olarak hem hızlı hem ekonomik bir çözümdür.Tabi burada gönderdiğin borsada btc karşılıkları nedir bakman lazım.Doge mesala çok çok hızlı ve transferi ucuzdur.
5112 2018-01-04 18:12:05 It is mindbogling to see legit projects like $VIA not even in top150 marketcap and see shit projects and vapourware making top100 and huge valuation. Crypto is a wierd market.

5120 2018-01-04 18:11:24 How about we redistribute from the few to the many. I think that’s why crypto came into fruition. For far too long the world has been run by the wrong people enslaving us in this corrupt financial system rewarding the few. It’s time to take our power back and stop being sheep!!!
5121 2018-01-04 18:11:24 Make sure you signed up at Bit-Z, one of the best Crypto currency exchanges at the moment. With a daily volume of 500 m…
5122 2018-01-04 18:11:19 I can’t wait til crypto currency goes back to being irrelevant
5123 2018-01-04 18:11:16 We are pumping the fuel for $sphtx , some bit more fuel and we can spark it, I hope , no rush its all for mid and lang term . Be patient :D

5125 2018-01-04 18:11:12 remember how exciting it was when the entire #crypto space hit 100b? We did that again in the last 4 days.

5131 2018-01-04 18:10:56 I don't think it will drop that much.  Maybe a 10-15% drop.  But realistically it will hover around this price for a bit, establish some legs, and then keep climbing.
5132 2018-01-04 18:10:55 Plz Resolve problem with swisscoin . 
Alredy lots of crypto take space .

5141 2018-01-04 18:10:21 Just learned buying cryptocurrency with another crypto is a taxable event. FML 暗号通貨で暗号通貨を買った瞬間に税金が発生するのか。がーん
5142 2018-01-04 18:10:16 soon people will understand how big kmd is. ripple is a cripple in crypto.
5143 2018-01-04 18:10:12 Imagine trading crypto currency and not humble bragging about it on every post
5144 2018-01-04 18:10:10 Remember the basic thing with life now is, did you invest into crypto? Link in Bio.  #BeFree 
5145 2018-01-04 18:10:08 And 97% of those people will have absolutely no use for atomic swaps.  Are we building an P2P electronic cash system or a crypto trading exchange?
5146 2018-01-04 18:10:07 Lol they are just affraid of platforms like #Steem and #Steemit coins, Facebook because a place to sell ads, no for content anymore, where #Steem makes now the difference with rewards for good contents  #Decentralization is just pushing them to think instead of getting profits
5147 2018-01-04 18:10:07 There are few tools that are focused on crypto trading. Those are not as powerful and multifunctional as Algory. We are pioneers in this market and we are going to become a leader in #cryptocurrency Trading Tools.#algory #ico #cryptoscanner #cryptonews #bitcoin $ETH

5151 2018-01-04 18:09:54 That's free crypto gains.
5152 2018-01-04 18:09:52 1 hour doesnt look the same. Bearish signs
5153 2018-01-04 18:09:50 So true.
5154 2018-01-04 18:09:49 so if you are looking for cheap Masternode to have play around try $CRAVE or $SCORE

5157 2018-01-04 18:09:34 We crypto investors are making 3X and 4X on our trades in just a few days while the stock investors giddy over making a little 15% return and calling crypto a bubble. Go look at what XRP, TRX and ADA have made me in past 3 days.
5158 2018-01-04 18:09:28 how short is this term?
5159 2018-01-04 18:09:26 how about lambo on the moon definition???
5160 2018-01-04 18:09:25 Do you think crypto companies raise substantial debt?
5161 2018-01-04 18:09:21 All cryptocurrencies are looking for believers. Why? They're a store of value primarily, not currency.
5162 2018-01-04 18:09:18 Please don’t steal my tweets :)
5163 2018-01-04 18:09:16 Well in my defense I just do crypto, so even simple software security is kind of at the edge of my expertise. But wow, the depth of the complexity and the fact that nobody looked before surprises me.
5164 2018-01-04 18:09:14 A mythical creature that lived 2000 years A.C (after crypto)
5165 2018-01-04 18:09:12 C’est quelle crypto ça ?
5166 2018-01-04 18:09:12 Everything is pumping today!! What’s the next coin to see big gains today!?
5167 2018-01-04 18:09:08 A currency with intrinsic value is actually a TERRIBLE medium of exchange, because you lose the opportunity to use its intrinsic properties by having it be exchanged as money of account.  That's one reason why crypto is better, is it has no other purpose.
5168 2018-01-04 18:09:06 so I got locked out of my crypto account awhile ago and had bought xrp at .70.. I finally got my account unlocked today 
5169 2018-01-04 18:09:03 The greatest thing about the recent #XRP bull run is that it has caused the whole crypto market community to reevaluate micro transaction payment systems. With #TRX and #digibyte all surging,a new era has entered the crypto space
5170 2018-01-04 18:09:02 @tymoss You mind DM'ing me some resources on crypto? I know the basics and am just touching my toes in the water right now. Are there any specific resources to learn about all the different types of crypto to gain insight on what to invest in? Thanks! Trying to make 2018 a big yr

5178 2018-01-04 18:08:37 Haha, thanks bro! Getting to the point where I wish I used a higher leverage 
5179 2018-01-04 18:08:37 Crypto Currency Mining is Awesome
5180 2018-01-04 18:08:37 a mue MN is expensive now at you need 500k coins. You can by a share of a mue masternode for 10k coins.

5214 2018-01-04 18:07:09 o mktcap é fundamental porque indica quão fácil é pra uma moeda fazer x2, x10 etc. Se o mktcap é de 20 milhões, só precisa de mais 20 milhões pra fazer o seu investimento duplicar, ao passo que pro seu investimento em bitcoin duplicar hoje precisaria de mais 250 bilhões
5215 2018-01-04 18:07:08 Bitcoin whales lose faith and all the new crypto buyers want “cheap” crypto
5216 2018-01-04 18:07:01 Do you want to api your balance in or enter it manually?
5217 2018-01-04 18:06:56 You make a great point. Could LTC be the first mainstream crypto payment coin?

5219 2018-01-04 18:06:53 If a centralized token can have this value , its just mean that bitcoin value should be 1 millions usd per coin and before december 2018
please dont even talk about 50k , all altcoin should be trade not less than 5 uds per coin. the whole crypto market is undervalued

5236 2018-01-04 18:06:00 F-secure people think is's a matter of time attack vectors are tested against crypto exchanges. On the other hand what is in the cold wallet (majority of reserves) should be safe.
5237 2018-01-04 18:05:57 For the record, The Merkle News listed  Visa after American Express.  They appear to have made a correction.  It saddens me to know a Visa partnership may not be happening.

5244 2018-01-04 18:05:23 XRP is designed to be a vehicle for moving/exchaging value. That's how it reduces cost. If Fiat (or your choice crypto for that matter) could move itself as quickly and cheaply as XRP does,  then we wouldn't need XRP.

5249 2018-01-04 18:05:00 It's possible in the sense that the crypto market at large will grow to $1 or $2 trillion. Not saying this is rational, but that the party may keep going through 2018.
5250 2018-01-04 18:04:59 For all you new people to crypto and forex trading don’t forget to pay taxes on your gains 
5251 2018-01-04 18:04:57 Yeah, I need to re-read the white paper again. Been awhile. But really like having to hold 1k $CFI for access. Also think the industry needs a filter for new projects, and hopefully they can be the standard for that.
5252 2018-01-04 18:04:57 Since they are pretty much the same price, I like TRX over POE in the long term.  I'd wait for a dip to buy on either, but don't wait too long.  It will rise up very quickly.
5253 2018-01-04 18:04:56 Sold crypto too soon and hates crypto?  Shouldn’t you hate yourself?

5263 2018-01-04 18:04:29 Be careful with timing of the United Bitcoin airdrop, which started the run.
5264 2018-01-04 18:04:20 I want to short $XRP soooo hard, but i burned my fingers in the last altcoin season. Shorted to early an lost a lot of money. Now i will not do the same mistake. #ripple buyers are totaly insane. I hate them from making Money with this shitcoin.

5350 2018-01-04 18:00:30 It is actually not a better price if you consider it in fiat, since the DENT valorization has done x2 since last week (good thing !). May be you should base your prices on equivalent in fiat, since users aren't gonna be crypto prices followers ?
5351 2018-01-04 18:00:17 are you trading crypto vs crypto there? what is the common crypto used there to buy other coins? is it #eth because of the low fees?

5354 2018-01-04 18:00:12 It’s bad for crypto over all. Pumping bad tech for the sake of making a quick buck. Raiblocks community seems solid. There’s even some disappointment amongst them regarding the price skyrocketing as it almost takes away from the tech itself (which is awesome).

5374 2018-01-04 17:59:20 Listening to crypto podcast #2 right now...you are a genius, investing Google into Ripple back then. Haha
5375 2018-01-04 17:59:19 Wel if you dream crypto and eat crypto for lunch for months non stop and make heavy bucks. You are lol
5376 2018-01-04 17:58:59 I hope everyone loaded up on TRX when it was at .3 cents. Second best crypto investment I've made! To the moon!

5381 2018-01-04 17:58:55 In #crypto world 2018 soon you'll not make it to the TOP 100 list on coinmarketcap with less than 1b market cap.

Just imagine that 100. position coin has over 1b market cap. And imagine where the top 10 coins will be. #CryptoCurrencies #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #ethereum #ripple
5382 2018-01-04 17:58:54 Also the key thing in crypto success is miners' incentives to actually mine. The fees will reverse follow mining time, making BTC unusable for any transaction. Also when fees fall below input costs miners will migrste in droves, adding even more friction.
5383 2018-01-04 17:58:49 $Steem ?

5401 2018-01-04 17:57:41 I also want to buy Bitcoin Core. I have kraken account, but they only have Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Core seems like a good opportunity. When they fix those glitches it could pump like Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

5435 2018-01-04 17:55:09 ...and also 100% centralized. Enjoy your centralized token that wants to align with the banks. Lol. Literally the only thing crypto was created to destroy. I don't understand why people want this centralized coin. This bank coin. This big company coin. Gross.

5457 2018-01-04 17:54:20 @PascalCoin Big fan of this project, and I would like to pitch in any way possible. Have you considered a redesign for the site? If so, when will this happen. Any news on rebranding? Because this technology is amazing.

5491 2018-01-04 17:52:35 Finally some positive news for #iota. Its the only top 10 crypto not gaining on this massive bull run. Hopefully this will help its loyal #hodl ers not lose faith in the project.
5492 2018-01-04 17:52:32 So I mostly stay out of 'crypto' currency since I'm very out-of-my depth there. Or at least assume I am because it often sounds like interesting ideas tied with utter fucking stupidity.
5493 2018-01-04 17:52:30 Lmao
5494 2018-01-04 17:52:27 How does this effect all crypto currency mining?
5495 2018-01-04 17:52:24 The crypt world is a puzzle. You do NOT have unlimited pieces (coins). Pick the correct ones to complete the crypto puzzle. Each have their own function and specific spot in the puzzle. At the end all will make sense  #cryptocurrency #btc #eth #altcoins #bch
5496 2018-01-04 17:52:23 If it comes.....Fantastic!!
5497 2018-01-04 17:52:22 After Nicolás Maduro launched his Crypto Coin backed by Venezuelan Oil, word on the street is that Evo Morales is launching his Coca Coin #ICO Backed 100% by pure Bolivian cocaine. #cryptocurrency #Crypto
5498 2018-01-04 17:52:22 Belarus adopted a law on crypto with 0 taxes on mining and crypto ownership. Very profesional and not expensive IT labour, electricity low cost....
5499 2018-01-04 17:52:20 In the 20th century, we had bull markets.
Since 08, we've had bubble markets.
And now we have #beastmode crypto markets.
It’s a whole new level of euphoria.
5500 2018-01-04 17:52:18 Everyone sure does love investments into crypto currency

5503 2018-01-04 17:52:12 But I just looked at their feed and can why you thought I did. They recommended all of these coins at one point
5504 2018-01-04 17:52:08 I wish I hadn't waited as long as I did, but I'm really glad I got into crypto eventually. Seeing amazing profits so far. Can't wait to see how my porfolio does in 2018
5505 2018-01-04 17:52:05 Last altcoin cycle in the beginning of the year, I made a huge mistake selling winners for 50-100% gains. With the amount of money that has been flowing into crypto, I'm not making that mistake again
5506 2018-01-04 17:52:03 He's a scammer
5507 2018-01-04 17:52:02 Keith you should look at digipulse. It will help the entire crypto market and still has a really low marketcap.

5512 2018-01-04 17:51:46 I don’t understand how people day trade in crypto. I mean I’m sure I could do it well if I really locked in & picked up the skills

5537 2018-01-04 17:50:25 It's a bit of a shit show with the crypto exchanges today. Most of the exchanges are either temporarily not accepting new user registrations  or throwing lots of technical errors under the heavy load. I'll give you a buzz though!
5538 2018-01-04 17:50:25 Bitcoin, Ripple, etc etc can this whole Crypto market just crash already. That shit is making me go insane

5540 2018-01-04 17:50:24 the only trap here is clueless newbs spewing nonsense... until the coinbase move has played out, ANY XRP play is has upward momentum regardless of the dips. Stop being a hater esp if you absolutely dont know what youre talking about. #dumbass #XRP #gethatmoney

5542 2018-01-04 17:50:23 What I said above could definitely happen. Some of the crypto people I follow that also have a decent grab of economics seem to lean towards that outcome. Time table for those events no one knows. soon™ I guess
5543 2018-01-04 17:50:20 sure bob, ive done great without luck...
5544 2018-01-04 17:50:18 I have ADA ,TRX , XVG , and XRP are those okay?

5546 2018-01-04 17:50:02 Its cute you think it'll be just the tether bagholders that will be destroyed. If Tether falls the entire market will collapse due to tethers buffing up everything crypto related.

5548 2018-01-04 17:49:57 and sad. Ripple isn’t crypto, it’s the exact opposite. Centralized, no mining, nasty control levers. Good for bank execs and gov, not good for the people.
5549 2018-01-04 17:49:57 Super excited about the commission I received from one collector today! 
Stay tuned for the next big big crypto paiting!

5552 2018-01-04 17:49:40 It's such a hassle moving $crypto around to get funds on the right exchange to buy a coin. Can't wait for $ethos
5553 2018-01-04 17:49:39 $TRX has a lot of potential left this month in my opinion.

5555 2018-01-04 17:49:29 @Obstropolos Hello do you happen to have a Discord channel ? or is it private ?...
5556 2018-01-04 17:49:28 #CryptoConfessions I still don't understand my trade history on Bitmex well.
5557 2018-01-04 17:49:24 I have a lot of new folkowers which is awesome! I hope we can make crypto history together. I am not all over the place, I follow few coins but I am the kind of person who do all the research I can on the coins I own. We are stronger together. $btc $alts $crypto $btcp $kmd $zcl
5558 2018-01-04 17:49:22 It almost doesn't with crypto, you can buy in at -30% and expect to see your money rise in the next couple days, obviously not suggesting anyone do that, research and at least learn about moving averages but still it's a beautiful time we live in 
5559 2018-01-04 17:49:21 Started Steve Nison last week. Good shit

5562 2018-01-04 17:49:12 All traders & #Crypto traders is there something I need to know  about $XRP? I'm hearing good and bad!!!
5563 2018-01-04 17:49:09 Thanks!
5564 2018-01-04 17:49:09 I don't think TRX is done, which is why I still have some, but anything that's pumped that hard is begging for correction.
5565 2018-01-04 17:49:08 Shhhhhh. Don’t tell people the secrets. ;) Though tbh this is still a great time to jump on crypto. Eth and xrp right now got me feeling some type of ways.
5566 2018-01-04 17:49:04 The video actually makes a great argument for @Ripple . If crypto is to ever be widely adopted, there needs to be a coin that bridges the gap between crypto and cash. XRP fits that role well. It appears many of the hatters are simply salty they missed out. It's not too late
5567 2018-01-04 17:49:04 Get on the crypto train let's
5568 2018-01-04 17:49:02 For the moment, only Kucoin.

5572 2018-01-04 17:48:39 My manager just as addicted to crypto as I am lmao
5573 2018-01-04 17:48:38 This man always deliver and keeps his words. That’s very important in this crypto game.
5574 2018-01-04 17:48:36 thanks for that! but hardly an expert in crypto. however, it is a daunting task for many people to trade anything not on coinbase -
probably why i think some of the other coins still have room to grow

also wheres the fun in trading anything that doesnt move +/- 25% in a day
5575 2018-01-04 17:48:34 Besides coinbase   Is there anywhere else to turn bitcoin into cash ???

I’ll get back with everyone shortly.
5582 2018-01-04 17:48:04 Already did
5583 2018-01-04 17:48:00 Bitcoin is unique, just because bitcoins market could follow a certain trajectory, it doesnt mean that everything with the word crypto in it can also.

5592 2018-01-04 17:47:46 cut your short before it's been to late :(
5593 2018-01-04 17:47:42 I know the feeling....There are lots of newbies that don't know a lot about trading, yet. They think if a coin is under 1$ it may be the next holy grail.
5594 2018-01-04 17:47:40 Scaling will be the one issue everyone has in common regardless of their viewpoint. From what I can see, XRP has zero scaling issues, making it too easy...

I use XRP as an example because if retaining the original purpose of  crypto is important, then developers must deliver.
5595 2018-01-04 17:47:39 Great stuff guys. Well done. This coin had so much in store for 2018
5596 2018-01-04 17:47:37 No no, I mean there are less coins than that, making the market cap actually lower, meaning it might not be so bad when it crashes.
5597 2018-01-04 17:47:27 I exited GEO with a small profit, DGB seems to be having another good day, unfortunately no position. I'm in XVG for the moment, which is a nice long term hold, not crazy on it usually for a day trade because there's just so much of it out there. #crypto #altcoins #cryptotrading

5601 2018-01-04 17:47:19 You know she’s reading this shaking her head thinking “fucking men, they’re all the same” 
5602 2018-01-04 17:47:18 No, I just own a moderately successful business. Put $20k in at around 70¢, you can do the math (possibly).

Everyone has their own definition of rich. Personally, I have not come even close yet, but at this rate #XRP may change that for my fam.

No "moon" talk, just facts.
5603 2018-01-04 17:47:16 Buckled in and ready sir 
5604 2018-01-04 17:47:13 There are some worrying signs in the #crypto market right now, indications that coins are being bought because of their low per-coin value. Indications that show a lot of people are unaware of what a #marketcap is... $XRP $XLM #TRX $ADA
5605 2018-01-04 17:47:11 $XRP is a centralized crypto currency.Hold it till it gets listed in Coinbase and sell it for profit.Crypto currency is to avoid middlemen. But ripple works for the banks and  I don't see the use of ripple on the longer run.
5606 2018-01-04 17:47:11 Ive held since and it just defies all logic, moreso than most crypto. Amazing news, it tanks. Extremely embarrassing press conference, it goes up. Mainstream media writes about it, stays horizontal. Crused is mostly a meme, it's great tech

5616 2018-01-04 17:46:47 Don't understand why so many people hate @ripple. Technology is 10X better that not auditable exchanges they are happy with. It facilitates cheap and fast in/out movements of value across crypto entities that more "trustless" PoW systems now are incapable of. It works.

5647 2018-01-04 17:45:12 Agreed. Problem is, with all current fiat > crypto exchanges, I’m finding the ID verification is delayed/impossible.

5650 2018-01-04 17:45:08 正月早々仮想通貨でやらかす。
2日くらいだったと思うけれど夢の中でビットコイン暴落+金縛りにあう→実際に見てみたらビットコインが上がり始めていてアルトが下がり始める。
金縛りのせいもあって正気が保てなくて狼狽売り。
今日もとの資金までよう戻した。
恥ずかしい

5653 2018-01-04 17:45:03 I can't wait to trade here.
5654 2018-01-04 17:45:03 it sure is, but there's really no doubt about it bouncing back up and well beyond the highs that were recently set. They've got a very nice mining setup that is far superior to many other crypto plays that are currently stealing the spotlight. filings will take this back up

5672 2018-01-04 17:43:54 Anyone else watching #DigiByte $DGB right now?  Impressive run they’re having. I caught them at $0.065, but think they got some way to go still. #HODL #cryptocurrency #Crypto #altcoins
5673 2018-01-04 17:43:51 Swapped most of my $XLM for $DGB yesterday. Smart move  #crypto

5692 2018-01-04 17:42:58 I agree with Rach here, there are more ways to skin the cat, Charlie saw a different route to get $ltc to where he wants it to be, he’s dedication is unquestionable.
Both ways are equally as good.
Go $Ltc go
Go $Trx go
5693 2018-01-04 17:42:57 Keep trying bro, ladies love persistence, just keep going and going, don’t take no for an answer. They really love that shit. If she calls the cops don’t worry, she’s into you. 
5694 2018-01-04 17:42:56 $XRP gonna be the knife in back of #crypto.  Disgusting.
5695 2018-01-04 17:42:54 They have lot's of improvements to make which in my opinion is a good thing, their website for example is terrible but apparently they are developing a new one, only up for this poopcoin  got me 150k nothing too much but even a few sats will make me nice gains

5716 2018-01-04 17:42:07 That said... plenty of shovel selling money with less risk. Whatever happens, Crypto is going to be "the thing" for 2018
5717 2018-01-04 17:42:06 I don't regret the big profits I've already made on them. I'm just moving into coins I feel like are safer bets right now.
5718 2018-01-04 17:42:02 In my view it will be all about taxes. Cryptos don't fit well into current tax structures and instead of designing new tax policies they will want to have oversight, which is contra-crypto.
5719 2018-01-04 17:42:02 I totally still use my 1Password, just not for any crypto logins. I’ve heard of people getting their coins stolen just by someone getting a hold of their email by using their PWM or iCloud to auto fill that field. Don’t know how they would get through 2FA though.. scary stuff.
5720 2018-01-04 17:42:01 Fantastic tech, great management and perfect vision. They got into bed with Citi, won the Citi challenge and I’m betting on #DGB being the transaction processor and deal closing technology (Digisign) for Citi. Huge potential.
5721 2018-01-04 17:41:56 I m sad to say but I lost something little on XVG then TRX ,XRP and ADA skyrocket me to the moon. I m ready for XML & hope XVG will launch again.

5734 2018-01-04 17:41:29 Does XRB have ILP? No it does not. Your reasoning is based off of transaction speed. You need a little more than that to solve real world problems. There won’t be 1 ledger to rule them all. And that’s what you don’t understand.

5787 2018-01-04 17:38:15 Yeah I assume it will take some time - thanks again for the tips. Overall, my feeling on crypto is similar to how I approach Vegas. Set aside what I’m willing to lose and expect to lose it... but, if I win, awesome! Regardless, I at least the ride will be fun.

5791 2018-01-04 17:37:56 Guys, get onto $QLC (Qlink) this goes flying off the radar. One of the best and unique ideas in crypto in my opinion at the moment! First part of product launch Q1 2018
Thanks @CryptoHornHairs and @CryptoGat for pointing me in this direction!
5792 2018-01-04 17:37:52 I read about crypto non stop and still dunno what #Mana is.  Someone told me it was Second Life currency so I left it at that
5793 2018-01-04 17:37:51 Your article on xvg doesnt even scratch the surface on privacy and is riddled with false facts and misconceptions.
You use incorrect information on how ross ulbrich was busted as well.

But then stabilise to more standard asset class gains

5827 2018-01-04 17:36:04 This is just idiotic. Do people really think that the transaction history in your CoinBase account bears any relation to what you spent / lost / profited?
Unless you ONLY use CB for all of your crypto transactions it's unrelated.

5846 2018-01-04 17:35:16 Bitfinex suspended it about 2 weeks ago before ripple exploded. I think crypto did it in general especially with ripples help.

Just because something's a bubble, doesn't mean it's a bad investment.
Just because something's not a scam, doesn't mean it's a good investment.

Position yourself so you can make money whether crypto wins or loses.

5863 2018-01-04 17:34:33 dont forget that #BCH and other alts have to prove scale first to be comparable to #BTC .     Lets keep all debates positive.  It is best for the Crypto ecosystem!!

5865 2018-01-04 17:34:31 That’s mostly why I’m irritated. There’s no reason for the crypto, but it’s a buzzword and so it has to be used.

And the stock market rewards them by trebling their stock price.

5881 2018-01-04 17:33:39 I've owned #XRP since 2015 (don't ask me why I bought it, no idea myself, but starting to liquidate now). Just spent a half hour or so looking at #XRP tweets but it was so scary I had to return to my normal timeline, that is not the crypto world I want.

5888 2018-01-04 17:33:24 Yh definitely national security. they will preach terrorism uses crypto to fund acts of violence (not mentioning the $ has been their choice of currency for decades) requesting crypto companies full disclosure of their clients an threaten to shut them down if they don't supply
5889 2018-01-04 17:33:22 Using your irrelevant market cap measurement as an example, the crypto market has gained 250bln in a WEEKS time. But you think 1trln is not possible in a year?

5909 2018-01-04 17:32:36 LMAO....not with that coin supply. Jesus stop trying to fool noobs in the crypto space. Will probably never even see half a cent.
5910 2018-01-04 17:32:36 @TommyWorldPower according to the trololo chart the last major crypto crashes happened at about 10x "normal" value. Do you expect that to probably happen this time too, or perhaps has the environment changed to much for that trend to be reliable anymore?
5911 2018-01-04 17:32:36 It forces the fight between different crypto fans. It shouldn't  be a "versus" in my point of view.

And if you don't know how to limit your losses (i.e. stop loss, etc) then now is your chance to study up on it while we wait.

6046 2018-01-04 17:26:05 With Ripple gaining so much traction and having such a large market cap, isn't it just a slap in the face for Crypto Currency and Block Chain as a whole?
6047 2018-01-04 17:26:05 fiat money lol crypto currency is the future, stock markets rigged  to shit
6048 2018-01-04 17:26:04 Crypto itself is a tool, IMO. 
I’d prefer that “crypto” be short for cryptographically-secured digital asset (less limiting since all cryptocurrencies are digital assets). There are different varieties of crypto -Bitcoin, XRP, etc. 
Ripple is a company. 
Is tether an IOU?
6049 2018-01-04 17:26:03 Whew!
6050 2018-01-04 17:26:01 @SatoshiLite selling is totally fine @justinsuntron . Come on. he’s trying to maintain/increase the integrity of @litecoin buy making it as decentralised as possible . In the true spirit of crypto / bitcoin. Why can’t the twitter community get that simple fact
6051 2018-01-04 17:25:57 The mass adoption the $crypto community was hoping for? Me thinks not  $xrp $trx $xvg sheesh
6052 2018-01-04 17:25:56 So……… thoughts on pouring fiat currency into crypto? Versus mining it and basically monetizing electricity and CPU/GPU cycles? I kinda don't like the former. It's treating it as a speculative asset instead of an alternative one.

6061 2018-01-04 17:25:41 What does 8k level mean?
6062 2018-01-04 17:25:40 Definitely. $100 is doable. If shitcoin like dogecoin can have $1B marketcap then why not BAT with $100 marketcap. And crypto market will boom in 2018 & 2019, people will see 100x for most of the coins. BAT has very bright future. Best bet for the next 2 years.
6063 2018-01-04 17:25:40 Speculative Execution and Meltdown may be paradigms for all of 2018 (security, crypto currency, executive branch of US government). :-)

6065 2018-01-04 17:25:38 I also learned about crypto from #waqarzaka , he was talking about this all the time and then i researched and bought myself and yes made profit. But now he is not giving correct information and it makes my cling when he says that bitcoin is rare .
6066 2018-01-04 17:25:38 Crypto market is just beginning. It will start siphoning money from other industries soon and surpass 1 Trillion (already at 700 billion). Tron is just one of many that will make you rich, make sure to diversify.

6089 2018-01-04 17:24:23 "by this point we expect several ATS licensed to trade security tokens to be up and running in the U.S."

I find it hard to believe this could happen this fast, but this would be a complete game changer for crypto.

6108 2018-01-04 17:23:15 @Raiblocks makes LTC obsolete anyways...it's only a matter of time
6109 2018-01-04 17:23:07 I've been accumulating Ardor since September and sold a part with satisfying profit, so I'm in no rush to sell.
6110 2018-01-04 17:23:06 It's all hype. About how XRP is going to be added on Coinbase soon and what not. It's not actually about the token itself, people are fomoing and buying in. Good profit for people either way. Which is what a majority of all crypto investors care about.
6111 2018-01-04 17:23:05 Thoroughly enjoying the @get_delta app. Smooth, easy-on-the-eyes, and intuitive interface. Simple to use. Sharp as hell! Could use “transfer” option to log moving crypto from one exchange or another. That’s my only (small) gripe. Well done, @get_delta.
6112 2018-01-04 17:23:04 same
6113 2018-01-04 17:23:02 Don't let crypt divide u like politics, religion, etc. People are so angry and hateful about team-whichever-coin they are on. Crypto is decentralized abundance 4 the people. Don't let yourself breed hate through it. Let the abundance flow 2 all. None of us knows how it will go.
6114 2018-01-04 17:23:02 You have a typo. The article says 0724 instead of 8724

6129 2018-01-04 17:22:20 Well look at this.  A "retweet for crypto" that actually delivered.  Kudos to @Jairalee  Others take note.
6130 2018-01-04 17:22:15 Bitcoin sucks because of its high fees.  I also think as people in Crypto make they will want 2 spend it.  BTC also sucks in this Dept. I love the innovation but realize that within the Bitcoin community there are issues....
6131 2018-01-04 17:22:06 I know I missed the serious profits boat, but I've been looking into the project and may buy $TRX tomorrow- but if there's one thing I know it's this- every ATH has a dip after. Don't be stupid. Be patient 
#crypto
6132 2018-01-04 17:22:04 Eth had way more than 9000% lol, it’s like your trying to act like you know what your talking about, but you weren’t even in crypto before these pumps even took place? You probably bought ripple when it was 2$ and made a quick 50% and think your the fucking second warren buffet.

6135 2018-01-04 17:21:55 The WORST thing for #altcoins is this massive +$100bn of retail inflow (based on NO tokenomics just FOMO and @cnbc coverage). The BEST thing to happen for $BTC reserve status is this altcoin rally. Sellers always collapse into a store of value and the crypto economy is growing.
6136 2018-01-04 17:21:53 Equity raise likely coming after the close today in $CNET. Company is almost out of cash and pr was typical crypto garbage. Short back down to $2

6147 2018-01-04 17:21:20 Anybody on my friends list trade crypto?
6148 2018-01-04 17:21:18 Bitcoin is the only true storage of value in the crypto space. You will get rekt if you believe these altcoin gains won’t be subjected to bleed once Bitcoin begins to run.

6188 2018-01-04 17:19:08 Accumulation going on right now. Get in while it's cheap. Always do your own Due diligence though.
6189 2018-01-04 17:19:07 That’s why I’ve only put less than 2k fiat in, having just started mid December... definitely see a large correction coming soon. But also feel confident my coins are of high value.

However, total crypto market cap is less than google stock alone so... still  lots of room 2 grow

6216 2018-01-04 17:17:11 I'm a newbie in this market but would still suggest to diversify your crypto holding instead of putting in one coin. Not only to reduce the risk but also to grab the entry level of different coins so that you don't miss the rally. #cryptocurrency

6235 2018-01-04 17:16:23 Crypto currencies have no real value, just like national currencies such as US Dollars, The Euro etc. Cryptos have no safety net like a national government to prop them up so the risk ( and reward) of owning them is much much much greater.

6291 2018-01-04 17:13:01 Crypto is now a market of competing currencies and tokens. The winners will be those that are technically sound, that serve valued use cases, and that are well marketed.

A rising price is great marketing for the short run, but is insufficient to solidify into long term gains.

Just for following the call, 0.01 btc per month.

I personnaly prefer paying 0.015, as you got money + knowledge.

6380 2018-01-04 17:08:15 On paper and for the timing being, a once-obscure crypto coin Ripple has made the CEO whose company markets it richer than Mark Zuckerberg
6381 2018-01-04 17:08:13 There's a ton of new people coming into $crypto whom brought money from other investments to buy $BTC, $LTC or $ETH. I'm curious where they reallocated funds from though. This is going somewhere, promise... #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #Altcoins
6382 2018-01-04 17:08:12 Ref links are the paid group shills of 2018. Really people, we are all making enough money out of Crypto, do you really need to shill the crap out of the latest ICO or exchange endlessly?
6383 2018-01-04 17:08:11 #RDD #Reddcoin looks to release RDD-ID in early February. Also a #Facebook + #RDD tipping usage? All signs point upward with #Reddcoin. #Overstock already has Redcoin in their system. Blue skies ahead!

6418 2018-01-04 17:06:08 Eu não me apegaria ao mktcap de qualquer moeda. A diferença é que ela vai ser negociada inteira, ao invés de frações como o BTC e outras com menos moedas disponíveis.

6451 2018-01-04 17:04:22 One thing I can’t get away from thinking about re #crypto and #altcoins, all the exchanges accept #BTC #ETH and #LTC to trade the altcoins. Are they loading up on those while the public runs to make a little on alts? Something to think about long term

6524 2018-01-04 16:59:53 True, the crypto universe will still grow, not as fast. Network value will move around. Key is knowing which go to zero and which grow in value.

- Relevant news and roadmaps
- Future potential earnings

6548 2018-01-04 16:58:13 Law? There's no law written that encompasses crypto currencies
6549 2018-01-04 16:58:05 Crypto currency and stocks are two COMPLETELY different things. Stocks are an investment, bitcoin is a toy.

6553 2018-01-04 16:57:52 They buy crypto for loaned money and make millions while we speak
6554 2018-01-04 16:57:49 Maybe this is how they kill crypto, suck gigantic amounts of fomo money into xrp then *click* turn off ripple.. 'see, we told you crypto was a bad idea!'
6555 2018-01-04 16:57:44 Just reminding folks that BTC - or any crypto - just because its used for bad things, doesn't mean its bad. That's it. Same as the Toyota thing.

6610 2018-01-04 16:54:23 i didn't doubt it. i was just frustrated that it was dormant, without any news, announcements, developments. I hear people (who are in crypto for a long time) saying how strong, powerful and amazing coin it is, but it lacks the PR. Anyway i am smiling now ;)

6654 2018-01-04 16:50:58 If cash can be used for illegal trade, so can the #bitcoin like crypto currency can be used. But despite that a traditional barter-like value exchange is happening. #bitcoinbubble @CNNnews18 @News18Tech
6655 2018-01-04 16:50:53 Twitter has been known to have a slant too.   OH MY what shall we do

6657 2018-01-04 16:50:48 And, I’ve done just fine in crypto, I’ve made good choices, but if I had only listened to trav’s advice I’d be in the hole. Another ‘analyst’ bought into LTC at $4 and is telling her followers to 'buy the dip' at $325, because it benefits her, not them. Thats why Trav is pushing

6659 2018-01-04 16:50:37 Power is out in parts of Vancouver today.  No storm, just likely lots of those crypto-miners that are flocking to Canada and sucking up electricity.

6662 2018-01-04 16:50:27 Hi there, I don't hold a position in #MCO but wow I've noticed (across the board of crypto) ppl are quickly irritated or provoked every time the candle moves. Are you trading it or holding?

6665 2018-01-04 16:50:21 Solo les quiero decir que Ripple subio casi 400% desde que les escribi esto y que yo vendi todo, no tiene sentido lo que vale ahora, tenia sentido cuando les escribi IMHO. 
Pero la gente compra sin evaluar si es caro o barato un asset en este mundo de crypto.
6666 2018-01-04 16:50:20 Malaysia doesn't ban, Vietnam totally bans, and South Korea bans anonymization- As #cryptocurrency regulation spreads, there are always gonna wins and losses for the crypto community.

6687 2018-01-04 16:49:02 I don’t suggest leaving anything on CM. The only thing good about having it on CM would be staking 24 hours a day, but then you put yourself at a risk of losing everything if a major hack happens.

6695 2018-01-04 16:48:33 Not true. Asset valuation, which is what an investor examines, has a process and Crypto-currencies are still in the process of development. This is why governments are get involved in tax regulation of transfers, and why some Nations don't allow crypto currencies and some do.

6753 2018-01-04 16:45:43 $XRP Ripple is a centralized SHIT-coin made to keep banks in the game.

Crypto-currency is the END of centralized transactions and banks as we know them.

6786 2018-01-04 16:44:04 Yes. Other tokens are actually in use. The banking industry isn't going using the XRP token and there is no asset contract, so xrp is the most ridiculously priced crypto.

6795 2018-01-04 16:43:25 If a crypto project wants to disrupt the global payment system, it must be inflationary. 

Why spend something that will be worth more tomorrow, especially when you will be subject to capital gains taxes each time you transact?
6796 2018-01-04 16:43:24 Seems closer to, pre-utilization mania. If this goes like dotcom, some will realize* (falsely) "omg these coins don't actually do anything"; bubble will pop; but then, with the adoption of truly functioning products, crypto grows even higher than peak bubble ever was.
6797 2018-01-04 16:43:20 I’m uneducated completely on this. Starting learning crypto from scratch. 2 follow up questions: 1/ why? 2/ should I remove this so no one actually buys it in your opinion?
6798 2018-01-04 16:43:08 right now, people are afraid of it but I think that having a crypto miner embedded on the home page will most likely be the next big thing.
the overhead needs to be tuned down and have it be known to site visitors somewhere obvious

6805 2018-01-04 16:42:48 Other cryptocurrencies overtaking bitcoin such as ripple etc? That’s true from the beginning. It’s just a matter of time! It is inevitable. #orioncoin #crypto #bitcoin #ripple #blockchain #iot
6806 2018-01-04 16:42:46 I have money on HitBTC..let's hope what you say is true. Another matter is the thousands of complaints HitBtc is receiving. Bad costumer service and so on.
6807 2018-01-04 16:42:45 You all shold sit down, and think about the fact, that you are lucky to be a part of crypto world. Since Finex, Trex and now Binance are closing registrations for new users, lots of people cant be in your shoes. 
6808 2018-01-04 16:42:40 Yes I did. I Haven't found anyone who accepts PayPal for crypto purchase
6809 2018-01-04 16:42:35 While I do not see anything wrong with legalization, It is not a solution for the opiod epidemic
6810 2018-01-04 16:42:32 I'd be a bad crypto journo--I'd tell everyone all their altcoins are pump and dumps and they should just buy bitcoin ;P
6811 2018-01-04 16:42:25 @enej_p your support team has not responded to any emails I’ve sent. I need to unlock my account so that I may utilize my crypto. Ticket # 307749. This is very frustrating

6815 2018-01-04 16:42:10 Yess, thank you ! Which TP for u?
6816 2018-01-04 16:42:06 Haha well...they do go hand in hand... In honesty though, I’ve got a bunch of money in crypto currency. I also built a crypto mining rig that is pulling in $1200 USD per month.
6817 2018-01-04 16:42:05 Thanks CK! :)
6818 2018-01-04 16:41:58 なるほど有難うございました。

6827 2018-01-04 16:41:34 @baikalminer hey there, I was wondering how can I get an Review Unit ?? I got a Community of crypto Enthusiasts who would love to know. 
6828 2018-01-04 16:41:32 Give it your all mate, you won't fail. Patience is the key in Crypto cause I never sell for a loss and I don't invest in shit cause I do my research first.
6829 2018-01-04 16:41:28 Me too. Over a week and no response from support
6830 2018-01-04 16:41:26 Professionally speaking, it should have dumped a long time ago. Speaking honestly, there's nothing professional about these markets
6831 2018-01-04 16:41:23 Interestingly... if settled, a few others have bought the same!
6832 2018-01-04 16:41:20 Litecoins turn!  #litecoin #ltc GET ON BOARD, SHE'S BACK!
6833 2018-01-04 16:41:19 This is wrong. There can only be one Cryptokek

6835 2018-01-04 16:41:14 Hey Rand, do you think wabi is another possible hidden gem on Binance?
6836 2018-01-04 16:41:13 It's going to explode. Like the crypto boner in my pants!
6837 2018-01-04 16:41:07 Bought a small bag of $ETC again
6838 2018-01-04 16:40:54 If you’re not making $$ in #crypto something is terribly wrong. Please re-evaluate your strategies. Just scalping/daytrading is cutting yourself short imo. And don’t forget about $BTC amidst the #ALT craziness.
6839 2018-01-04 16:40:50 Anyone know of a web-based solution that provides the same functionality to track your crypto portfolio similar to the Blockfolio/Delta apps? Specifically looking to enter purchase price in BTC rather than USD as most transactions were with BTC pairs. $BTC $ETH $XRP $XLM $LTC
6840 2018-01-04 16:40:49 Going through Kraken Hell is basically a crypto right of passage.

6845 2018-01-04 16:40:37 Yeah, ETH has treated me well thus far. TRON has been a fun ride the last week or so too - possibly long term potential, but who can really say (though they do have crypto puppies coming :D).

6860 2018-01-04 16:39:53 先程のと同じ内容でしたか？
失礼しました
ありがとうございました
6861 2018-01-04 16:39:52 This is just my third week in crypto, but the information from #cryptosrus has been so helpful Good picks, but also solid information about the market itself and background information about what you need to do, and what not. I hope that I can join your insider group soon. 
6862 2018-01-04 16:39:49 I know, I mean I need UAE bank which support such transactions and if bank asked me I can tell them this is profit from crypto trade. But as I know most banks will close my bank account in such case.
6863 2018-01-04 16:39:46 No worries. Link in my bio. We’re here to help!
6864 2018-01-04 16:39:40 How do you think life will be in 12 months of this crazy #crypto?!?  #GodWilling

6868 2018-01-04 16:39:31 Surround yourself with people who invest in quality crypto projects with strong hands

Last thing you want to do is sell on a 2x and then see it at 20x a little while later

6870 2018-01-04 16:39:15 と同時にcrypto yenを政府通貨として発行。crypto yenは政府通貨として日銀を介さず発行する事で実体経済との乖離した価値を円の価値を保ったままcryptoyenが実体経済を刺激、POBは実質、国債の償還ということになる。

6874 2018-01-04 16:39:07 bitcoin FXは，bitcoinを貯めようとすると難しい。12/1,2の大暴騰と12/15,16の暴騰で大敗。日本円としては少し増えるがbitcoinは減る。bitcoinを貯めるなら，一度両替して，そのまま持っておいた方が無難かも。
6875 2018-01-04 16:39:04 One things that baffles me is the argument  that crypto eliminates the middle man and bank fees. Yet theres def quite a few middle men and fees. I think thats a poor justification
6876 2018-01-04 16:39:04 All good, it's just the market depth on GDAX for ETH showing where the buy and sells are, lots of people selling at $1,000, so it'll need heavy buy volume to overcome that
6877 2018-01-04 16:38:58 It shouldn't. Like I said, I love seeing people make money. I'm happy folks are reaping benefits from crypto. Ol boy just tryna have a dick measuring contest or something.
6878 2018-01-04 16:38:55 
6879 2018-01-04 16:38:50 So excited for Crypto’s future
6880 2018-01-04 16:38:49 everyone, please keep talking down Bitcoin while my other crypto currencies triple in value since x-mas.
6881 2018-01-04 16:38:45 Bruh, do you have any solid resources on setting up a masternode?
6882 2018-01-04 16:38:44 crypto. digital spindletop. how long will it boom? when will it bust?
6883 2018-01-04 16:38:35 How is your investing going?
6884 2018-01-04 16:38:34 Think I should consider organizing #crypto meetups every other weekend or something
6885 2018-01-04 16:38:33 do any of you have any money in Crypto? curious as to what people are doing and how far in people are.
6886 2018-01-04 16:38:27 yes send them to that eth address. test with a small amount first
6887 2018-01-04 16:38:18 Wow. I'll have to do my research but what is a crypto profile?
6888 2018-01-04 16:38:18 Hard to do it knowing it's not a real crypto, with no real use, with no mining, with no decentralization
6889 2018-01-04 16:38:16 Sickening how manipulative the media can be...and when then general public gets involved in a "new" market like crypto/fintech..how quickly the market can sway in the favor of those institutional investors. CNBC has grandma buying XRP
6890 2018-01-04 16:38:11 お疲れ様でした

6892 2018-01-04 16:38:09 Verifying accounts for all these Crypto sites is a pain in the rear 
6893 2018-01-04 16:38:07 Its critical to only trade crappy coins, and invest in good ones. Same thing with the dot com bubble but who wouldn't want to be holding AMZN AAPL or Google NVDA etc. #OmiseGO #eth #crypto
6894 2018-01-04 16:38:07 Crypto will make second class citizens of anyone who doesnt invest.
6895 2018-01-04 16:38:05 All thinking $NEO, it's actually $VEN that will take the spot light
6896 2018-01-04 16:38:02 Never use @coinbase to send or receive #bitcoin. Been waiting for 24 hours for a simple transaction to get confirmed. Funds still pending. Fiat banks are faster. Act like a billion dollar crypto company not a bank. #pathetic
6897 2018-01-04 16:37:58 Slowly but surely #RDD coin REDDCOIN is on his safe road to TOP20 # crypto #BTC
6898 2018-01-04 16:37:58 I win money too. But I can see that all the hope of bitcoin for a currency freedom will be fuck by centralised coins. Those who are in will make money buy everything under bank control.. They win again, no new age.
6899 2018-01-04 16:37:56 Pro Tip: When you don't understand something in $crypto - refuse to do any personal research and immediately call it a scam
6900 2018-01-04 16:37:49 FUD and buy low . This scam will not work any more.
6901 2018-01-04 16:37:47 Ripple kopen is vloeken in de kerk. Crypto is ontstaan omdat banken een crisis hebben veroorzaakt. Dezelfde banken hebben nu ripple bedacht. Gulden werkt aan een sneller veiliger goedkoper en makkelijker betaalsysteem decentraal

6908 2018-01-04 16:37:24 Please quit bashing BTC. Just tell us why BCH is great.  If BCH is as great as you proclaim, you can make another bazillion dollars by just promoting BCH.  When you bash your BTC, you do damage to crypto and make the market look unstable to those not familiar with the marketplace
6909 2018-01-04 16:37:21 One of the most undervalued coins in crypto, @hedgetoken $HDG, needs to be on @kucoincom. It is going to be a game changer.

6913 2018-01-04 16:37:09 If I started a page for crypto-currency education etc would you be interested. Click like if yes!!!
6914 2018-01-04 16:37:09 What a joke.Why are deposits and withdrawals still stuck days later? You should be giving away 10 free $coss for every $50 you held up for 24 hours or longer. You're going to lose a lot of supporters handling business this way. Traders shouldn't have to beg for their own funds.
6915 2018-01-04 16:37:05 The withdraw limit is set by the exchange not banks.

6923 2018-01-04 16:36:24 Well, if we are already using fiat money based in “confidence” why not using a virtual currency already. The thing is bitcoin is just one of the hundreds of crypto currencies there are. Betting for the winner is the challenge

6935 2018-01-04 16:35:44 Don't patronize me when I'm close to the edge. I'm on thirty minutes of sleep and had to explain crypto currency to my parents
6936 2018-01-04 16:35:38 Crypto isn’t stock. Market cap is irrelevant.
6937 2018-01-04 16:35:28 @romantrader @Kawhead Especially when it comes to crypto related stocks so many newbies
6938 2018-01-04 16:35:26 If they only emphasised on the PR and were more professional, it would definitely rise.

6948 2018-01-04 16:34:43 But if, at some point, the people inside that diagram turns out to be a vast majority of the people in the world (not counting 3rd world countries) and they end up adopting crypto as a currency, does it really matter if they are ignorant?
6949 2018-01-04 16:34:42 Crypto Kitties!!!!
6950 2018-01-04 16:34:40 Gotta admit he’s right, I do make crypto great

僕のフォロワーさんはきちんと調べて考えて行動してくれる人が多くてたすかります。
そういった人たちが増えれば後々自分にとっても有益な情報をシェアできるので嬉しいです

あ、あと僕もブロックされましたw

6954 2018-01-04 16:34:33 Hit Solutions at that address is a HR company
6955 2018-01-04 16:34:27 It’s a bull market, renting is practical and you can put the savings in your portfolio or into crypto assets.
6956 2018-01-04 16:34:19 Looking forward to it! Thanks for sharing.
6957 2018-01-04 16:34:16 LOL. Crypto = Pre construction currency. -> but it now, years before you can use it for way cheaper than it will be when you can use it 
6958 2018-01-04 16:34:15 1000$K a bit late Bro...
6959 2018-01-04 16:34:13 Omg good thing 2014 Romano didn't get in on this coin. They'd find your dessicated husk at your computer, tissues still in your hands
6960 2018-01-04 16:34:11 So they hold new regs until upgrade I guess? I'm sure they'll upgrade at this point, they have to be making a ton.
6961 2018-01-04 16:34:09 What the fuck is binance?? Will u send code??
6962 2018-01-04 16:34:05 Building a crypto portfolio is awesome, but trading crypto in the markets is a go!!
6963 2018-01-04 16:34:05 I don't believe crypto is dead, I just think there are way too many people involved to get rich quick, it's a recipe for disaster, especially short term when people get pissed off their not millionaires
6964 2018-01-04 16:34:03 @Arriva_NL Nieuw logo? Ook voor op treinen? 
6965 2018-01-04 16:34:03 i would like to thank @MikeSchutte for introducing me to crypto currency. he will be the first friend to board my yacht.  #AllAboard

6967 2018-01-04 16:33:57 Are you aware of any prominent Indians involved in crypto and active on twitter?

6973 2018-01-04 16:33:26 Nej, stik modsat. Crypto-data kan ikke slettes eller ændres. Der vil altid være et spor tilbage til oprindelsen. Guds gave til skattefar :)
6974 2018-01-04 16:33:24 deposited some yesterday, took an hour to appear, odd and a bit annoying, nothing major from my end
6975 2018-01-04 16:33:22 Your mission is to boost the new cryptos ?
6976 2018-01-04 16:33:20 Lmao my account doubled. This is ridiculous I love it
6977 2018-01-04 16:33:07 Crypto Key from @JulianAssange and a date of the 4th and two others. Anything yet? #followthewhiterabbit #Qanaon
6978 2018-01-04 16:33:05 I think ill do a twitter crypto give away and then try to bait people into my "private ICO group" meanwhile betting -500 lines so my record is winning. Nice one #crypto #mma #bitcoin
6979 2018-01-04 16:33:02 should we buy in now?
6980 2018-01-04 16:32:59 but more exciting !!

6982 2018-01-04 16:32:56 BC is not a complete solution. It needs to be used in a central banking function to keep crypto from hurting the global economy. Else crypto will never reach its potential. Great investment opportunity I think.

6989 2018-01-04 16:32:34 I don't like how some of these news is misleading. Why? I am a life-time bull on crypto ecosystem especially bitcoin however no single smart person should put all his/her capital into bitcoin at this point.
6990 2018-01-04 16:32:31 I work the 9-5 and buy and sell crypto while I'm on the job. Double the money double the fun
6991 2018-01-04 16:32:29 They coin mooned right before the tweet
6992 2018-01-04 16:32:27 Now check those gains on #trx
6993 2018-01-04 16:32:25 Agreed! I haven't read a magazine in years, but i'm enjoying this.
6994 2018-01-04 16:32:25 Oh, for god's sake. Even if Ran were to stake ten years salary worth of XRP he wouldn't move the market and all his announcement is tantamount to is that he's splitting two picture cards. It's not a technical analysis. It's a gamble.
6995 2018-01-04 16:32:20 Already it has crossed Uber..!! Just a start...!! And wat if I say... Market cap in not the scale we should see when it comes to crypto. Time to change the basic for investors.

7015 2018-01-04 16:31:22 I think it will. #Verge had a market cap of $79 million on December 1st and hit $3 billion exactly one month later. Yes #XVG has since dropped in market cap but this shows how quickly a #crypto can grow. One with a team like #Enigma's is an even safer bet

7080 2018-01-04 16:28:04 Crypto is such a new space, it's like nothing ever created before, and the first of its kind. Does it have to make sense? Can we compare it to other markets? It's all speculation but it could eventually be worth more than we ever thought.

7111 2018-01-04 16:25:46 Look at the price?quite shamefull that you sold excc at high price by saying lending and sold few cents Excc token upto 2.5$
7112 2018-01-04 16:25:43 What sort of hypocrisy is this? On your blog u write how things like BTC r completely pointless and a very bad investment. I was really starting to follow you but I guess it's not worth it? I think you also see this crypto bubble as an opportunity and want to make quite a profit?

7125 2018-01-04 16:25:14 You mean that banks use RippleNet, right? That is of course well known. They are not using another coin and we think they are using XRP. They are currently using RippleNet services and many are moving on to XRP. At least they say so. Of course they can be joking.

7153 2018-01-04 16:23:20 Exacto. El token y la descentralización tienen unos paradigmas que Ripple no cumple. Por eso, toda la gente que cree en las crypto como nuevo sistema, no apoya Ripple. Ahora, como apuesta por parte del sector banca para seguirle la estela a las crypto, muy bonito.

7200 2018-01-04 16:20:25 Thing is that it looks very likely that banks and institutions will use XRP. You may not want it, but when CEOs say that they want and will it is kind is silly to deny it.

7207 2018-01-04 16:19:47 Yes, this tweets are misleading for someone who is new. Don't buy ETH.
7208 2018-01-04 16:19:46 Stake size was about 550,000. But the stake reward is the same for whoever wins the stake (between 1,000 and 2,500 based on block then -5%), not % based on your stake. But the larger your stake the better chance you have of winning.

7228 2018-01-04 16:18:28 Ok. As an aside. One advantage to currency, and digital currency. (not crypto), is the ability of authorities to ID large sums used in the drug trade, illegal weapons, bribary (India), human trafficking.  Just like anything BTC is/will be used for illegal purposes.
7229 2018-01-04 16:18:24 I think shorting any coin with use case is risky. Having total of 9-10mil active crypto users is barely barely scratching the surface.

7234 2018-01-04 16:18:03 The crypto I wanted to test went up 400% (3 weeks) since I tried to open an account at Bitstamp and Kraken. One of the biggest problems with crypto is all these damned sites not being able to keep up.

7248 2018-01-04 16:16:56 Just discovered another hidden gem. $POSW is one step ahead in the crypto space and where blockchain is headed in 2018. Unreal potential and extremely undervalued. Folks this one could be a game changer for PoS. DYOR.

7253 2018-01-04 16:16:36 Thank you! A bit harsh but rather close new user registrations than to frustrate all users with lagging performance.

7265 2018-01-04 16:15:33 LOL, you're assuming the value derived for $XRP is coming from average speculators... i'm done arguing with ppl who don't understand how finance works. Good luck man - we'll see who's right in a couple years 
7266 2018-01-04 16:15:24 I do not claim I do. Not hodling, but shorting any coin... You currently about 9-10mil crypto users total. Shorting coins with use case sounds too brave to me.

7271 2018-01-04 16:15:11 So because of BTC's crazy run up over the past year, a lot more people then usual will feel winners in this ponzi scheme (they got more $$$ back then invested), but the big majority will lose BTC on it and that's the ponzi scam.

7281 2018-01-04 16:14:27 The key to a successful crypto isn’t to deface other coins to help boost popularity but instead work on integration into e-commerce. The most widely accepted and useable coin (as a currency) will rise. @SatoshiLite @CryptosQueen @rogerkver
7282 2018-01-04 16:14:25 They are burning the coins used on the auction for parcels of land in Virtual Reality... meaning those 161 million coins will be taken out of circulation and the coins you buy now will be ever more valuable... Issa No Brainer

7292 2018-01-04 16:14:04 In addition to the possibility of leaking kernel memory via the browser (so remote vector), there is also the cloud environment issue, a VM from a customer (insider attacker) could get leaked information (crypto keys?) from other customers' VMs...
7293 2018-01-04 16:14:01 Indeed, $BCH is not decentralized. @rogerwu and @jihanwu are behind this project. It is all about power and they are thirsty to become next FRS....

7295 2018-01-04 16:13:58 Will crypto make a meaningful impact on our lives or will it turn into an insider get rich scheme. I guess time will tell

7298 2018-01-04 16:13:51 Brutal exchange and I don't know how KLK is going to have mass appeal with this shoe exchange, but you have a nice track record so it's worth a gamble, which has already started paying off

7302 2018-01-04 16:13:38 why XRP could?
7303 2018-01-04 16:13:36 not yet.. according to their CEO it whould..
7304 2018-01-04 16:13:35 oh yes perfect trading day.
7305 2018-01-04 16:13:32 35k $ Q1 still valid in your opinion?
7306 2018-01-04 16:13:30 It is complicated though, especially without a financial background. And most get confused by the fact that's it's a BTC ponzi scheme. So they could pay out more in term of $$$ value, but they will NEVER pay out more BTC then what's deposited (in total).
7307 2018-01-04 16:13:20 Mainstream media started covering big on Crypto-currency from end of Nov onwards. I think it attracted a lot of new investers with high risk averse profiles which in turn pulled in speculators. Transaction fees and underlying values of the currencies are too vague it seems to me

7312 2018-01-04 16:12:57 Not going to enter any more positions whatsoever until the next #altcoin dip. Sitting on my hands and following my rules. Probably only swing trades after this.

7347 2018-01-04 16:11:27 3x not enough ;)
7348 2018-01-04 16:11:26 I finally got my hands on some TRON ! been trying to buy since it was at $0.03 and coinbase was taking forever to verify my account , new to crypto hope this works out
7349 2018-01-04 16:11:16 $TRX has now gone 100X since November, the 500 free airdrop that all #binance users got back in November had $1 value, now is worth $100
7350 2018-01-04 16:11:16 If I can give you my point of view is that crypto to me is about learning everything to do with investments.  I've been consumed by this
7351 2018-01-04 16:11:13 It’s good you have achieved stability. Like gold is stable at ~$1250, I know my BTG war chest is also always stable at ~$230 a coin. That pacifies me as I do not have to constantly gaze at the crypto prices.
7352 2018-01-04 16:11:10 The most sensible thing you can do is to cease trading on @hitbtc and move your coins, money, crypto out from there... do it at the earliest. It's your money, you deserve better. #hitbtc

7356 2018-01-04 16:11:05 Agreed it’s dissimilar in that respect but they need time, they are new to crypto, baby steps. It’s good for all coins. It’s basically the same in a none tech savvy customer sense. Ie log on and buy with debit Cc. Wallet facility etc should comer on a later phase.
7357 2018-01-04 16:11:04 On second thought. There is a perfect crypto coin for @mathijsbouman which is called $XRP, the centralised crypto to control by banks & CEO of Ripple.

7364 2018-01-04 16:10:33 Give it a few minutes :) Then the price will go to 1300 or a bit higher and then all that profit will flow into BTC...

7529 2018-01-04 15:59:01 El artículo habla de todo tipo de dispositivos...se ha filtrado antes de programar parches...el mundo se convierte en un queso de Gruyere...la excusa perfecta para pinchar la burbuja de las crypto...o un crash bursátil que ya toca! Es broma todo, eh!

7536 2018-01-04 15:58:36 Bittrex is having wallet issues with an abundance of coins which they blame #azure for.  I've been waiting for my $DNT transfer to @BittrexExchange for 19 hours since the block was confirmed.
7537 2018-01-04 15:58:34 I’m getting way more likes and retweets with my crypto commentary
7538 2018-01-04 15:58:23 It’s like a mental illness lol. If they were spreading facts it would be a different story. Their only aim is for people to not buy xrp just so they can protect their precious market cap. It’s silly

7550 2018-01-04 15:57:56 #innovation in #crypto is actually hurt by the amount of current speculation. The #technology isn't being used enough to justify value forecast & investors aren't actually interested in the tech or implications.
7551 2018-01-04 15:57:50 Yesterday a chick asked me about crypto only to back door & ask if it was worth it....when I say she almost got blocked like don't waste my time.
7552 2018-01-04 15:57:38 If you can't cough up the $10 USD for the latest issue of @21Cryptos then you need to rethink if you should be trading alts at all.

7577 2018-01-04 15:56:03 Agree this is key. So I think the question is why do buyers/holders believe XRP has value? Along the same vein, why do buyers/holders believe any crypto has value. AND, how will those perceptions change? Do developing events strengthen conceived perceptions or weaken them?

7587 2018-01-04 15:55:26 Well they can be printed at any time like fiat, so no cap, which is bad in the sense it is not what crypto currency is about. Same reason I don't like ETH, but do like ETC or BTC, you need a fixed cap or silly things happen.
7588 2018-01-04 15:55:11 Billions in meme based crypto currency and still no flying cars. Or affordable houses.
7589 2018-01-04 15:55:08 If your only value play is that your "crypto"currency transactions are really fast. I have news for you. DOGE is faster
7590 2018-01-04 15:55:08 Regel 1. Alles wat snel omhoog gaat komt naar beneden. 

Regel 2. Kansen zien is vaak kansen verliezen of laten gaan, neem je tijd met alles in de crypto wereld.

7594 2018-01-04 15:54:45 So if i order hardware wallet i have to wait for its delivery and i dont think so its wise to wait this long. Tell me any online wallet which is reliable
7595 2018-01-04 15:54:44 Have you been in crypto long? It sounds like you’re new perhaps? Things like this happen-it’s a technology based currency you’re dealing with—issues will arise.
7596 2018-01-04 15:54:42 I don't know if you have the brain capacity to figure out this is 99% an unsustainable platform when theres no new investments coming in. If you go and make 365% profit on the normal exchange you'd be a hero.
Even if crypto is easier 365 is completely unrealistic..
7597 2018-01-04 15:54:41 I think crypto needs a renaming. It being the opposite of fiat (the elite they say this, we say that), it should be termed consensus or consensu-currency. Just as there is a consensus that gold and silver are valuable, or the works of certain artists, or certain cars, etc.
7598 2018-01-04 15:54:38 @Steven_McKie Make me a millionaire off crypto pls!
7599 2018-01-04 15:54:37 Isn’t that the point of crypto? Plus everyone seems quiet aware of tether operations and yet no one is bothered. Perhaps you should reconsider your position

7609 2018-01-04 15:53:55 When starting out investing in crypto, I would suggest investing in bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, and bitcoin cash.  Once you see profits in these, take those profits and use them for trading other alt-coins.  NEVER GO ALL IN ON ONE COIN!

7672 2018-01-04 15:49:39 The biggest fuck up jaitley can do is ban cryptocurrencies.. He should just legalize them and tax them if revenue is all he wants.. Currently all crypto exchanges in India have stopped transactions in and out since new yr.. Most likely govt pressure on banks
7673 2018-01-04 15:49:26 So should I not have converted my savings into crypto currency?
7674 2018-01-04 15:49:26 I’m waiting for the first crypto mining induced blackout
7675 2018-01-04 15:49:16 ALISは1週間で2倍になった模様です
7676 2018-01-04 15:49:14 Newbies have been around for a very long time and will always be. Now, you can capitalize on their naïvete like a true wolf or guide them. It makes you look like a really shitty winner, being slightly better than the victim of your criticism & not trying to guide them. $CRYPTO

7680 2018-01-04 15:49:00 I Love This Crypto Shit Man
7681 2018-01-04 15:48:58 Could $Trx hit $1 this year??  #trx #tron #crypto $Trx
7682 2018-01-04 15:48:54 Andreas warned us about this. Buy bitcoin, and use alt coins to make profits to buy more bitcoins. Ripple and the usd are the same. Printed from thin air and used to fuck with new crypto investors. Let ripple go to 500 trillion market cap. Its can still fuck off.
7683 2018-01-04 15:48:39 It’s fun to watch people opine about the future based on obviously speculative runups. This week, $Crypto is doomed because $xrp and muh centralization!!!1 

In a few days/weeks/months, the narrative will change entirely once something else catches a bid.
7684 2018-01-04 15:48:35 Pourquoi ça devrais choquer ? Dans un modèle économique type action boursière ça choque mais dans le monde de la crypto c est du pipi de chat
7685 2018-01-04 15:48:26 Had a feeling fam.
7686 2018-01-04 15:48:14 Matter of time my friend 
7687 2018-01-04 15:48:11 I'd say totally opposite when it comes to these trio: 
$GNT - good tech (already Alpha, almost done, soon Beta - both on testnet; in few next months we will get mainnet release for public)
$XEL - it's working at least on testnet
$SNM - good marketing, 0 tech

7694 2018-01-04 15:48:00 stocks are old news for old people....it is all about crypto
7695 2018-01-04 15:47:58 Yes, though less in the northern Hindutva form than in the Dravidian one. The Dravidian mvmt positioned religious minorities as pseudo- or non-Tamils (Periyar himself did this) so even if it was anti-Brahmin/North, it still relies on a crypto-Hindu identity of a different kind.

7699 2018-01-04 15:47:53 Cuz ripple needs to go higher then whole crypto together.
7700 2018-01-04 15:47:48 I’m buying this dip in next couple hours. Thanks once again for your never ending help.
7701 2018-01-04 15:47:48 You should know you shouldn't do that

7707 2018-01-04 15:47:06 Funny how it works huh. People who weren't good at saving money, are now good at saving money via crypto. Why couldn't they put a wee bit away before?

Glad i found you so early.:)
7721 2018-01-04 15:46:25 I can use a fork to eat my cereal... what do you mean it can be used "over"? 

Bitcoin cash is best because it is the most secure, low transaction fee coin out there, a return to pre segwit bitcoin to enable microfinance and micropayments with much lower risk of chain rewrite.

7726 2018-01-04 15:45:45 I guess a year back the Desk head told the intern "can you go look at this bitcoin stuff I will concentrate on XYZ (fx/eq/comm.)" 

Now its probably like "can you go trade all the XYZ, I have to look at this crypto stuff" 
7727 2018-01-04 15:45:45 The way I see it, garbage and hype were always present and widespread. Plenty of fake accounts and scam coins compaigns. It's the nature of social media, especially these days. During some periods of crypto space add up more unique commotion (like now) and yeah, it's annoying.

7733 2018-01-04 15:45:25 now, that said, if you created a platform or service that helped to divert 10-20% of those mega/powerball bets into $BTC, you'd impact total #cryptocurrency 'market cap' materially. unlike lottery tickets, #Theta decay in crypto isn't as draconian.

7746 2018-01-04 15:44:20 No problem!
7747 2018-01-04 15:44:20 en même temps, à part affoler temporairement els marchés, l'arrivée de Bitcoin Cash n'a pas eu l'effet annoncé... et encore, il n'est pas encore arrivé sur Coinbase en euro... mais je ne pense pas que cela permette au Bitcoin Cash de s'envoler. Je prévois la même chose pour XRP

7750 2018-01-04 15:43:41 Crypto twitter hates $xrp. The general public does not. I get more questions about xrp BY FAR compared to any other crypto. Still think it was room to run. That being said what mechanism are you using to short?

It could be something as simple as a home made chapati or a bitcoin. Btw someone minting crypto-currency other than the mint is not classified by Indian law
7767 2018-01-04 15:42:35 lol you cant buy at that price. If you try and buy it just goes from regular market price. Looks like a coding error

I can only imagine the collective freak-out at crypto exchanges.

But yes, please explain more thoroughly what you're experiencing.

7785 2018-01-04 15:41:43 Yesssss which crypto are you investing in?

7788 2018-01-04 15:41:24 Dunno, but I think what you are saying is true for crypto in general. I got interested in this stuff because I believed crypto can bring transparency and improve lives of my people. But, past few months make me think that maybe I am wrong.
7789 2018-01-04 15:41:20 The layman does not care how you process the details in a system. What users want is their problem solved. This is the added value of products & services. This is what I called as RATIONAL THINKING!! Not a kind of #Crypto to offer idealism in a fantasy world. #Ripple $XRP
7790 2018-01-04 15:41:19 Ripple is the devil's crypto
7791 2018-01-04 15:41:17 Hey harry! What’s your long term (6-12 months) target for Ripple?? Is 10$ plausible? Thanks in advance:)
7792 2018-01-04 15:41:16 Yeah I'm sure all the people who are doing second mortgages to invest in crypto will be alright.

7800 2018-01-04 15:40:42 I am also a big crypto believer and been heavily invest for a while. Was more playing devils advocate because I wanted to hear everyone’s perspective. I do think it needs to stabilize in price more before people really adopt it though
7801 2018-01-04 15:40:40 sans aucun mépris hein, mais je vois ton compte pour moi t'es juste un random (encore une fois sans mépris) et quand je vois le nombre de mecs qui balance des infos dans ce genre (qui mènent finalement à rien) depuis décembre voilà quoi :)

7803 2018-01-04 15:40:33 This explains how literate crypto investors are. A friend told me, im not going to buy Ethereum its too expensive,  I will buy ripple its only 3$ . Tried to explaon to him, but he could not get it, ripple is more expensive than eth, he just can’t get it.

7806 2018-01-04 15:40:28 It's important to be diversified in order to ensure you don't miss out on other projects that are also doing great things. 

You haven't missed $TRX, it's not done. 

$XVG is also not done. #HODL 

Both great potential to increase value of your portfolio.

7807 2018-01-04 15:40:27 Wrong.  Bitcoin was not the biggest money maker. Ripple (xrp) was. Over 40,000%.  Try crypto and learn
7808 2018-01-04 15:40:21 Are you not selling coins to people ? Are you not charging people for basic crypto buying training ?

7813 2018-01-04 15:40:00 Your right. Crypto block chain and it's "mining for reward" design is extremely inefficient. Block chain will require a new technical approach before wide adoption.
7814 2018-01-04 15:39:58 Forewarning Unfollow or Block me if you don’t want to see Crypto Currency Tweets. Take ya broke ass that way

7816 2018-01-04 15:39:50 Verge IOTA Stellar and TRON possibly Lisk will own 2018..
7817 2018-01-04 15:39:49 Sad but true. It's actually normal to pay taxes but the question is... how much are we willing to give? I think, somewhere down the road, crypto may change how we view and execute taxes.
7818 2018-01-04 15:39:44 $xrp is going to be a shitstorm this year. If you’re into ripple for the tech, you don’t understand the crypto space and you need to reconsider what the fuck your doing. 
Trade it for gains and then dump that garbage

I can’t believe this shit is $3+

7825 2018-01-04 15:39:28 OMG. How crypto has spoilt us!! 2-3x gains are insane already.
But of course, it's better to play with smaller mcaps with small btc sizes for higher potential gains.
7826 2018-01-04 15:39:28 @coinbase your fees are outrageous!  I understand now why experienced crypto players hate your exchange!  I feel bad for all the noobs using your exchange  just because it convenient and easy to buy $BTC.

7842 2018-01-04 15:38:52 Anyone heavily invested in something are likely to promote it. So it creates a lot of FUD in crypto. Do your due diligence on any coin you purchase. Even that is not good enough sometimes. The market is volatile due to many reasons.
7843 2018-01-04 15:38:46 Governments want it to be hard to take fiat > crypto. The end.

7861 2018-01-04 15:37:51 2018 might be the best year to lose your shirts. I’ve been in crypto for long enough to know this current excitement about rising prices is always followed by a massive crash.

7864 2018-01-04 15:37:40 Leaving your crypto on an exchange puts you at risk for a lot of things. If you don’t hold the keys, it’s not your crypto. That’s the golden rule.
7865 2018-01-04 15:37:37 Since I’m now a slim/skinny pants wearing white fella who works in a semi-corporate office setting, here’s my tweet about investing in crypto currency.

7872 2018-01-04 15:37:08 Crypto currency is better to trade short term than long term. The part where it blows up in value has passed, so making alot of money is not going to be as easy. Crypto currency also has no financial backing making it a flimsy long term investment.

7889 2018-01-04 15:36:08 Yo creo que sobrevaloras el conocimiento que tiene mucha de la gente que esta entrando en Ripple, la verdad...los que están dentro del mundo crypto desde hace tiempo, lo primero que hacen es desconfiar de una moneda cuyo 30% lo maneja un CEO. Creo que es Hype, no valor refugio.

7914 2018-01-04 15:34:16 I guess there are newbies that are relying upon the fact that ripple is backed by banks, which BTW is a typically newbie error in the cryptospace. But yeah, we should all think twice before putting our money in one project or the other.
7915 2018-01-04 15:34:15 Sucks that bittrex has decided to lock up their mana wallet.

7922 2018-01-04 15:33:39 Actually,this has nothing to do with it.Russia and Venezuela are both EXTREMELY corrupt states that depend on oil prices.Both countries are under US sanctions (Russia for military aggression in Ukraine) and need crypto to avoid trading in $. Global dist. has nothing to do with it
7923 2018-01-04 15:33:28 Is this an official IOTA twitter feed? I ask because this seems to be fanning the speculative fire that is Q.

7927 2018-01-04 15:33:12 I said rising. Crypto funds are emerging. Eventually they will borrow fiat money to play with crypto money. Note that banking system is always leveraged. Lehman brought it down. Crypto will bring down system.

8000 2018-01-04 15:29:10 is that not that complicated bro look at RIPPLE 's circulation......and now look at Bitcoins Circulation, thats the reason it got to 20k, inflated or not, you will respect $BTC at 10k or at 100k based on fundamentals, i will not respect $XRP based on banker inflated circulation
8001 2018-01-04 15:28:58 Could you explain the difference between tokens and coins? I believe tokens come from ICOs and coins are actual crypto?
8002 2018-01-04 15:28:46 However, insiders can only cash out to the extent allowed by the new coming fools that join in, and this creates an issue.  As crypto prices rise, it becomes harder and harder for the original concentrated few to cash out, they must rely on the foolishness of outside buyers
8003 2018-01-04 15:28:41 I'd recommend a ledger nano s or trezor hardware wallet. Long term storage and security is as important of a component as there is in crypto

8033 2018-01-04 15:27:02 Great! I think this is the kind of information that needs to be in front of every person new to crypto, like myself. Instead of relying on just rumors, this will allow them to make their own educated buys/sells.
8034 2018-01-04 15:27:00 It's alright it's only a small cap. 

Waiting can be costly in crypto. The obverse of patience is key.

8037 2018-01-04 15:26:52 @Tickeron Really love your software, but, it's just not ready for crypto. I have no clue how to "chat" with you or get support. Your coverage of crypto is terrible. You don't have most top marketcap coins. You don't add things when I recommend them. #cancelling
8038 2018-01-04 15:26:50 I love how even though old media are now reporting about crypto every day, by the time they put out a story about price moves, the story is irrelevant. 
Pretty big sign of the times.
8039 2018-01-04 15:26:49 mucha gente no entiende que esto va mas lejos de nomas hacernos ricos y controlar nuestra propia monedas, hay instituciones y poderes que ya notaron que esto se les ha ido de su control, y tienen que figurar maneras de meterse en esto como sea........

8041 2018-01-04 15:26:43 I use binance more—which has its own issues too—almost every exchange does—even Coinbase. All of these crypto exchanges need better customer service and live chat.

8045 2018-01-04 15:26:20 People talk bad about crypto currency but if you study it a little bit and find the right companies to invest in you can double any amount that you put in, in less than a month.

What bank can you do that with? NONE
8046 2018-01-04 15:26:17 I'm still of opinion that whatever is going on, devs may take their time if they need. Like it IS the race in the #crypto space but at the same time it's not and some things are better done properly than rushed. But it's good to know LN will be coming sooner than expected.

8090 2018-01-04 15:23:28 Not a coincidence that public getting sucked into crypto at end of 3rd wave cycle. Era of easy gains almost over. Never ends well.

8093 2018-01-04 15:23:21 Look at the chart. Everyone is looking for something that hasn’t pumped. ETH has been rallying and I believe this will follow over the coming weeks

8100 2018-01-04 15:23:08 Stock investments are down. Measured by google search rankings and subreddit subscriber activity (stocks vs. crypto) We have a bubble in the making.
8101 2018-01-04 15:23:06 A lot of companies have authorizations from their BoD to issue more shares. We don't calculate those market caps on what might be issued however. I find it interesting that parts of the crypto community are, however, valuing coins on future issuance.
8102 2018-01-04 15:23:00 crypto is fun.. it's my new hobby between wow patch cycles
8103 2018-01-04 15:23:00 Crypto currency is "make believe for millennials".

8109 2018-01-04 15:22:33 no va a llegar a 50............el precio de ripple esta muy inflado, lo van a vender porque quieren incrementar su pocision en bitcoin y ethereum, ellos llegaron tarde a la fiesta y esta es la manera de hacerlo.............
8110 2018-01-04 15:22:31 $dgb, $sc, $lbc, $rdd, $xmy and even $ESP learned me a valuable lesson: Even if you don't want the coin anymore, don't dump it but put some high sell orders. There always comes a time, when lots of new money is flowing in when newbies buy your bags.  

#Crypto #Lessons
8111 2018-01-04 15:22:29 Learn about crypto and why this whole movement started. Crypto = anti government and anti banks. Saying “it is not reality“ is just false, for many ibdividuals including me it already is reality. Your choice :)
8112 2018-01-04 15:22:22 Absolutely amazing day on the crypto market, portfolio up over 40% today. If you held any alternate coin to #BTC then you've made a killing today #CryptoCurrencies #HODL #moon #CryptoNews #NEO #ADA #trx #tron #omg coin

8117 2018-01-04 15:21:58 But it wasn’t just Lehman with leverage the whole banking system was stupid leveraged.  They aren’t even a part of this crypto spree and have much stronger balance sheets now.  I agree with you that leverage will undo some individuals.
8118 2018-01-04 15:21:50 Yes

8120 2018-01-04 15:21:46 Ok, rephrasing: XRP have been supported by big companies. This fact, of course, does not makes it a bad tech or worse. But it should be kept in mind! It has some fundamental differences of other crypto projects

8139 2018-01-04 15:21:07 You won’t hear back. But your balance will appear. They just had an article on CNBC and one of the most searched sentences “how do I buy ripple” bring an influx of amateur investors who unfortunately are slowing servers and business. Be patient, you’ll get your crypto

8143 2018-01-04 15:20:53 The difference is @SatoshiLite is building up LTC and growing it organically.  For a HODLer, I would rather have it grow slow and steady than a moon that has no substance

8165 2018-01-04 15:20:01 I’m surprised how many in the investment industry acknowledge the momentum factor but poke fun at crypto. Whether you like the asset class or not, momentum is undeniable. There’s $ to be made.
8166 2018-01-04 15:19:49 Nice got my bags at $5, $34 and $40 waiting for this to break $100 as support
8167 2018-01-04 15:19:40 @novogratz is this a general statement to all crypto or are you for some reason singling our XRP? If the latter, provide your rationale as XRP has a lot more utility than a store of value (e.g. BTC). Plus I heard from a bird that you thought $XRP was overvalued at $0.20..
8168 2018-01-04 15:19:39 So many people investing in crypto now that it’s been tough to deposit/withdraw or trade for that matter but do some research if you’re a stock kinda person. Regular stock market, AND crypto currency.

8176 2018-01-04 15:19:02 I don’t think it’s possible to loose coins while staking without a hack happening which would be pretty unlikely with a PoS crypto. I received 948 COLX on my first stake. I also stake ECA and have never had an issue with that.

8290 2018-01-04 15:11:04 Se os bancos quiserem usar Ripple, eles não precisam comprar XRP - eles podem simplesmente usar Ripple como "intranet". Você acha mesmo que os bancos que vão ficar dependendo do mercado livre de crypto para definir os preços das suas transações interbancárias?

- Enable 2FA on all accounts. SMS is not a valid 2FA method any longer.
- Yubikeys (or any U2F device) are the best 2FA method. Google Authenticator will suffice as well.

8359 2018-01-04 15:06:33 It's not about the pump; it's about the magnitude of the pump. 
There has never been a pump this huge in the history of crypto so far and for many it could really shatter the trust in the market if they were left handing with bags of worthless XRP with no utility whatsoever.

8399 2018-01-04 15:04:44 Lately I’ve been assessing whether crypto is currently a bubble or a speculative frenzy.  To your point, I think it really depends how a bubble is defined.  Money still changes hands at present.  I’d be much more worried when bets start getting made with money that isn’t there.
8400 2018-01-04 15:04:38 @exodus_io will support Ether hard fork?
8401 2018-01-04 15:04:36 @usab4976 it’s a crypto currency
8402 2018-01-04 15:04:31 That's proof that crypto is a bubble. (At least in terms of FOMO running to coins without logic.)

8406 2018-01-04 15:04:19 hacia unos días me dino alguien que lleva tiempo tradeando en crypto que veía Ripple como un caballo de troya. Cuando lo escuche me reí, pero ahora ya no me hace tanta gracia.

8432 2018-01-04 15:03:05 Of course I am sure there will be a few sells at 1k (I set a few months ago in case of flash spike) that may still be active. But I think we will find out within the hour.

8456 2018-01-04 15:02:10 Quite the same here. $XRP appears to be losing steam from the main fomo markets. I would imagine many outlets have " $1000 $ETH " headlines awaiting to hit publish and that could spark some interest. Similar to when BTC done 1k then 10k for example.

8532 2018-01-04 14:58:14 I only have 4,000 TRX but at .03 

I wish all you fortunate to get in early a happy New Year.  Tron is a great team and I only wish I started researching crypto sooner.  I'll wave you all off to the moon!  Good luck all!

8540 2018-01-04 14:57:36 I've heard horror stories of people selling and waiting for the dip and then losing out because the price just continued to go up. I wouldn't try this unless you know 1000% what you're doing. I'm new to crypto game (6 months in) so no expert but I wouldn't go ahead with this plan

8543 2018-01-04 14:57:25 Lo que puedo ver es que los banqueros con ripple tienen dos opciones: 1.Seguir inflando el capital de ripple para que la gente gane la confianza de ripple y luego hagan caer el mercado de bitcoin y ellos haciendose del bitcoin barato. 
2. hacer que caiga ripple y todos xrp llorar

8558 2018-01-04 14:56:48 お金2.0の概要を説明すると「今後は資本主義社会ではなく、信用主義社会になりつつある」ということ。

つまり今後10~20年は資本主義社会と信用主義社会の狭間である時代なので、資本主義でお金を稼いでいきつつ、SNSやWEBで信用を集めていくことが正解。

8561 2018-01-04 14:56:38 That’s what they claim. What they will do and their real intent is different. I’m venezuelan and a big fan of crypto. Believe me when I say all they care about is consolidating power. The opposite of what crypto should be.

8564 2018-01-04 14:56:10 I’ve made half a million in crypto my friend. Diversification is still key. I have 40,000 tron, and do intend to hold, but when you’ve made as much as I have, you begin to take interest in the actual technology as well - and I happen to like #xlm.

8566 2018-01-04 14:56:00 Basically something during my studies. But when it comes to crypto, I was watching youtubers first. By time comes experience and you‘ll learn it. Swing trading is the easiest way, because you buy and sell in 30 secs to 1 hour intervals maximum atm.

8568 2018-01-04 14:55:52 daar ben ik het wel mee eens. maar je moet ze kopen met doge coin. dat is de meest volatile en waardeloze coin die er bestaat. wat dat betreft dus wel redelijk risicovol

8600 2018-01-04 14:54:16 that is weird bitfinex trades fiat on ticker so what happen when you deposit usdt? ..... so you are saying every USDT is actually a premium derived from converting crypto into per 1 usd = equivalent btc ..so they are giving you less USDT and keeping premium for printing more USDT
8601 2018-01-04 14:54:12 It would be comparable to other crypto currency, most likely BTC.

8625 2018-01-04 14:52:20 The internet has allowed $crypto to ignite and takeoff much faster than the dot com bubble. This means the bubble lifecycle is accelerated and focused on a smaller number of projects. I call this the #coinmarketcap effect because most focus and gains are from the first page.

8704 2018-01-04 14:48:10 Often thought perhaps bitcoin creation was more about dethroning the dollar and toppling the US than anything else. One of many theories..
8705 2018-01-04 14:48:04 Merrill Lynch. The creator of billions of BK toxic mortgage securities. Went BK sold to $BAC and rescued by the government. Bans its advisors from talking or trading #bitcoin and #crypto. Oh the irony. #Satoshi would be proud.

8770 2018-01-04 14:44:53 so i "found out" about BTC 10 years ago. i haven't contributed much to snakes and their prostitutes/lambos donation fund except from exchange thefts (*oooh we got hacked*). #BTC is the ONLY crypto i need and want. i am not greedy. sometimes i do have to cash some out on need
8771 2018-01-04 14:44:44 When I read monetary economists on bitcoin in particular, but crypto-currencies in general, the only insight I get is the following: while we know the use or function of money, I don't think we really understand what money is.

8795 2018-01-04 14:43:04 Market cap of a crypto is not equal to market cap of a corp. Tokens are not shares. Value of Swift (the society) is not the same than valuation of the utility of Swift (network).

8817 2018-01-04 14:41:15 Bitcoin is about decoupling money and the government, i.e. an element of libertarianism, and it has been very successful. Libertarian-leaning politics and economics is what created all of the modern civilized world. You are very confused and in crypto for the wrong reasons.

8824 2018-01-04 14:40:51 There is a lot more ripple in circulation than there are bitcoin. So even though their individual value is less, because there is so many they still add up for a large market cap. Someone correct me if this is wrong.
8825 2018-01-04 14:40:43 There is a good chance $ETH will overtake $BTC in market cap this year.

8827 2018-01-04 14:40:31 @krakensupport i would like to withdraw ALL my crypto... but your website is always DOWN! How can I do that?
8828 2018-01-04 14:40:23 1) XRP is a crypto currency 2) It is open source 3) There is no mining 4) fair distribution? They say Satoshi and whales own 70% of BTC 5) becoming more decentralized is a major priority 6) power by whales and/or one company is the same...its who you trust.

8833 2018-01-04 14:40:01 Would be a massive risk. Bitcoin’s biggest strength currently is that it has wide adoption. If another crypto gets anywhere close could trigger a tipping point in which $BTC loses relevance. Non-crypto people equate crypto with bitcoin. If that changes look out.
8834 2018-01-04 14:40:00 people don't care, they see crypto or weed in a new releases then they go crazy... wake up will be hard for some investors!

8969 2018-01-04 14:31:01 SET เขา New high แต่เราแม่งดอย พอร์ตแดง -6% แหนะ 5555 
แต่ Crypto นี่อีกเรื่องเลย รถใหม่เอาอะไรดี
8970 2018-01-04 14:30:58 Haha, that’s me right now.

8972 2018-01-04 14:30:53 well, Japan still has big problems with debt and aging society. But this bet on crypto could really boost economy in the long run if Bitcoin price keeps rising. Crypto is great experiment that starts to impact large countries. Lets see where it leads
8973 2018-01-04 14:30:52 $trx is still going strong and $xlm is losing its grip! Place 7 up for the taking for $trx? Nobody knows but the view is beautiful nonetheless! Stellar, give in to your superior! Do not interfere with TRONs conquest for crypto domination! #TRON #HAILTRON #GameOfCrypto #GoC
8974 2018-01-04 14:30:42 God Hanna. That was beautiful. 

Isn’t Crypto like life.  Vigorous and exciting to be a a part of and most rewarding only when in lived in thought of others. I’m picking up some PIVX this week, and sticking with your team for the long haul. Much love to your beautiful family. 
8975 2018-01-04 14:30:38 Totally suxs !!!But its better it crashes due to the crypto sector being hot !!!! Alternative is it has ZERO action. But i do feel your pain !!!!
8976 2018-01-04 14:30:34 Nah! Not a true crypto

8984 2018-01-04 14:30:03 Okay fine if that works for you. So I'll pay the commission for you and you pay me ~20k for 1 bitcoin?
8985 2018-01-04 14:30:00 When someone says a particular crypto coin can never reach a certain dollar value, I go back to look at posts by people saying same about bitcoin five years Ago.
8986 2018-01-04 14:29:58 I need to follow your steps this month with my small amount. I really need money for my study. Big gains my goal.
That is why you are my boss
8987 2018-01-04 14:29:54 $ELF could be the most undervalued crypto right now
8988 2018-01-04 14:29:53 Finished listening to @CryptoStreetPod with @CryptoMessiah - Great job guys! When he mentioned that his gut feeling can influence a trade, I immediately thought of $crypto trading as 3-legged stool - TA, FA, and gut being the 3 legs. You need to heed all 3 for successful trading.
8989 2018-01-04 14:29:41 How to avoid tax on crypto earnings...

8992 2018-01-04 14:29:32 Twitter, telegram, discord, steemit - these platforms dictate crypto
8993 2018-01-04 14:29:32 Verge is my largest holding which still does not mean anything now but  I feel good about my 5 coins I thought I was paying too much for ripple at 1.50 lol I could notget as much as I wanted. if wire had cleared just a little sooner Better late than never should be crypto motto
8994 2018-01-04 14:29:31 It’s like saying people are obsessed with mining btc will there be something better to look forward to in 2018. NO! Masternodes and mining are both here to stay otherwise people wouldn’t make money
8995 2018-01-04 14:29:29 Love seeing my bros on this Crypto Wave .
8996 2018-01-04 14:29:28 I bought it when it was $6 and I still keep buying on dips. No plans on selling it after doing some research
8997 2018-01-04 14:29:24 @MiMSTARz Cool le live sur la Crypto, moi qui y connaît rien sa donne vraiment envie de s'y intéresser :)
8998 2018-01-04 14:29:20 Verge ($XVG) looking good again. I'll buy the next dip.
#Crypto #blockchain #Bitcoin #litecoin #Ethereum #Dash #Ripple $BTC $LTC $ETH $DASH $XRP $XVG
8999 2018-01-04 14:29:18 Ok I get that, but the current collective consciousness also states that keeping coins in exchanges is not a good idea either. The crypto space actually promotes keeping your private keys. Shouldn’t that be something we can focus on? Educating masses to keep bitcoin in private?
9000 2018-01-04 14:29:18 The current crypto pump & dump by BIG MONEY reinforces more than ever the need for #Bitcoin to succeed and change the current monetary paradigm for good.
9001 2018-01-04 14:29:16 $XCP <3 pump it

9005 2018-01-04 14:29:03 for all those who laugh at blockchain, the cryptos, and all the bullshit about bubble and burst - do you know the scale of millionaires the crypto economy is generating every minute? let the bubble burst - most would have made their money - while you are still watching!

9012 2018-01-04 14:28:29 Thanks! I love this tweets!
9013 2018-01-04 14:28:25 and no reply from @laurashin b/c she doesn't have knowledge behind the narrative she is sharing... she just follows it because that gets her the most likes/follows in her echo chamber community
9014 2018-01-04 14:28:25 Happy New Year Chris - love your work!
9015 2018-01-04 14:28:21 +While the interest on the Euro is negative the interest in Crypto raises and raises. 

+Nobody wants euros. Even people who have cash ask for a credit, their euros bring 0 advantage. 

+As soon as you get Euros you exchange it for stocks, a house or crypto

9017 2018-01-04 14:28:13 On a tous déjà entendu un de nos amis nous parler de cryptomonnaies, non ? Et a-t-on déjà entendu une seule personne se gagnant d'avoir acheté quelque chose avec cette monnaie ?
Le marché de la crypto est devenu presque uniquement spéculatif à peut-être quelques exceptions...
9018 2018-01-04 14:28:09 主な要因
①XVG59sat仕込み
②TRX100~200sat台で仕込み

大きくはこの二点だろうな
9019 2018-01-04 14:28:06 Eek. I now have 5% of my investment portfolio in crypto. A bit scary, but I think an appropriate level of risk / reward. Importantly, my main investment strategy is still indexes, contribute regularly, hold for long term, rarely check @PAvraam
9020 2018-01-04 14:28:06 haha I did the exact same #eca trade as you - great gains!
9021 2018-01-04 14:28:05 I need a real crypto boffin to assist me, looking to get into some new launches but am big nooby. Please help :(

9023 2018-01-04 14:28:02 So started in the crypto world on Dec 13. Already up 400% thanks to $XRP, $XVG, $TRX, $FUN, $POE, $XLM, $BCN.
9024 2018-01-04 14:28:01 wow I missed out on over $15,000(!!!) of crypto gains because it takes days to get money into my account
9025 2018-01-04 14:27:57 I bet everybody in crypto is. To some extent.
9026 2018-01-04 14:27:57 I don’t think it’s a matter of will there be some10better. As masternodes are here to stay as they play an integral part of the network by verifying transactions, so I don’t think it’s a Flavour of the month type of statement.
9027 2018-01-04 14:27:55 "Cryptonaut" is a good crypto portfolio manager if you are looking for an alternative to Blockfolio
9028 2018-01-04 14:27:53 I saved this thread. Such great advice
9029 2018-01-04 14:27:48 It seems $ETC is finally braking out?  #etherumclassic #bitcoin #altcoins #crypto #blockchain
9030 2018-01-04 14:27:44 今日loopring買いました^^
9031 2018-01-04 14:27:33 Nothing to do with selfish motives. I cannot in good conscience support a coin that defacto promotes people storing their money on exchanges and that will have the balances of wallet users increasingly stuck.
9032 2018-01-04 14:27:33 That's actually #Ripple $XRP
9033 2018-01-04 14:27:33 ちょうど今日で原資の10倍超えたな。
一ヶ月で10倍まぁまぁなんじゃないですか？
9034 2018-01-04 14:27:22 So there appears to be heavy traffic accross crypto networks.  New capital entering, $btc gonna pump and possibly #Altcoins at the same time
9035 2018-01-04 14:27:21 @binance_2017 what are you guys up to? ETH transfer in not resolving and now total balances glitching. Get it together - keep up your good record! #crypto #Binance
9036 2018-01-04 14:27:20 Se me pone el cuerpo malo de ver ese marketcap. La pseudocrypto infiltrada podemos llamarla. A ver lo que tarda la gente en darse cuenta que es shit
9037 2018-01-04 14:27:15 Apart from BTC and BTC forks, all other coins in the top 10 (by market cap) are not mineable.  I am not sure what to make of this.
9038 2018-01-04 14:27:13 the dgb has earned it right

9042 2018-01-04 14:26:51 Il suffit de regarder le cours historique des cryptos ou leur performance sur l’année 2017
9043 2018-01-04 14:26:50 While you sit back and watch $trx/$xrp moon, make sure you pick up some $dgb! It’s about to break out big time and set a new ATH! $dgb $trx $xrp #crypto #cryptocurrency

9055 2018-01-04 14:26:14 Today looks to be like a good day for crypto but I think a huge correction in coming very soon. Either way I'm never selling

9064 2018-01-04 14:25:40 A few thoughts.

-Roughly .0004% of the world's pop. has invested in crypto.
-Promising signs of mass adoption in 2018.
-Even if prices are rising, it will be nothing compared to 1% adoption.

Perspective.

9066 2018-01-04 14:25:38 Lots of #bitcoin #maximalists out there spreading #FUD about  $XRP without doing their homework. I think a healthy $BTC is good for all crypto, but I’m not sure it can stay relevant with high fees and slow transaction times.
9067 2018-01-04 14:25:38 That’s somewhere along the lines of what I was thinking. Not sure when all the ICOs are coming out but I’m thinking about starting a bag of $NEO here shortly
9068 2018-01-04 14:25:34 The last week in #Bitcoin #IRL...my mate asked me to buy him a bitcoin (srsly), a guy at work asked me about the tax implications of holding bitcoin, and two guys at the gym were talking about the best exchanges and wallets.
My conclusion...girls just aren't into #crypto :)

9083 2018-01-04 14:24:34 Stupid question, but gotta ask.  What's TA?
9084 2018-01-04 14:24:29 Or you could link to the type of graphic I'm talking about since there is a deluge of crypto information, and I've already spent four hours drafting a post on XRP.
9085 2018-01-04 14:24:27 I understand all #crypto related services are under huge load these days... but I do not want to go back to excel files, @BlockfolioApp . if you add servers, backup and import/export option I would be happy to pay few bucks for your service.
9086 2018-01-04 14:24:26 Before all of this they were predicting $1 by the end of the year and for it to be a top 10 crypto, but now who knows. It's top 10 now, gone up over 300% since I jumped in, and there is some big partnership being announced in a week. Listening to Steve >>>>>>>>>>>>

If I had a satoshi for everytime crypto twitter called a floor...

...I would have quite a few satoshis 
9090 2018-01-04 14:24:20 Plenty of hodlers saw the intention of your heart and affirm that it was the right thing to do.  Without a moral compass in this crypto whirlwind what do you gain really? A lambo?  Not worth your soul!!!
9091 2018-01-04 14:24:17 Oh snap lol, the Rippening! I hold far more XRP than BTC currently but still personally would feel more safe long term in BTC. I guess this is what it looks like when mainstream entrants begin to outnumber the OG's.

I agree w/ Andrew's sage advice though.
9092 2018-01-04 14:24:15 Amen Brother, that is why Bitcoin Cash will succeed. Let us spread the word in a positive voice, bring to light successes and encourage and support those projects that have the foundation for real growth..  for the entire crypto space. CryptoLove!

9099 2018-01-04 14:23:58 @internxt_io Hey guys, loving the project! Great progress so far. Just need to up your marketing game slightly I reckon. 3k followers is nothing close to what you should have! Any idea when you'll be on new exchanges also? $INXT #crypto

9101 2018-01-04 14:23:47 Not exactly the same, but by marketcap I predict a 5X in a 18 months time frame. This is only true if there is no general bear market which is always a heavy possibility.
9102 2018-01-04 14:23:47 The world and the crypto need Wall Street to stabilize demand for exposure and returns.  The crypto economy is simply not ready to support the world and all of it's customers.  Especially the exchanges and mining industries. Hedge funds and ETFs will lighten the load. #bitcoin
9103 2018-01-04 14:23:46 The goal is to make more money off crypto than ya weed man off of bags

9115 2018-01-04 14:23:01 I've only been in crypto since mid-November and I feel like I've been on the craziest roller coaster ride of my life. I can't fathom what the market is going to look like on December 31st, 2018. O____O.

9163 2018-01-04 14:20:13 So now you are being the arbiter of what’s considered a valuable asset? The market is supposed to decide that. This sounds an awful lot like what central banks do. 

Being named after a Keynesian concept, not surprised. Just not sure why you’re not bringing it to crypto.

9165 2018-01-04 14:20:09 Learning about crypto has diminishing returns. Research dulls your intuitive grit- makes you gun shy. It takes aggressive ignorance to succeed in this space; retarded naïveté.

9265 2018-01-04 14:14:39 As soon as I saw the bitcoin building on wall street next to the banksters, I knew it was a government backed money. Crypto currency is a back door to cashless society and control of us.

9267 2018-01-04 14:14:38 Holy crap I could never fit how many things the crypto has to have for me to risk it low risk.  I got over 20 different things low risk picks must have for qualifying as low risk.  Also my personal method isn't free. I developed it myself. So keep wondering.

9274 2018-01-04 14:14:14 So I was put on game that the big thing to invest in right now (as the coins become saturated) is crypto BANKS. Eventually they will start loaning & holding & distrusting coins within a banking system so look to a few upcoming banks to invest in while they’re super low

9308 2018-01-04 14:12:14 With respect, does anyone know how rich Satoshi Nakamoto might be? I have no idea if this is accurate information, but if it is - this is just the beginning. Crypto winners will be taking over monetary control of the world pretty quickly.

9349 2018-01-04 14:09:50 When you close a forex trade you lock in that win it's a done deal. But cryptos are very different. Even Tether is still a crypto asset. When you swap one for another you take "equal" risk. You cannot call that a realized gain. For entering a new age, things sure stay the same.

1: Don't get greedy, take small wins instead of looking for that 1 big gain. Sell when ahead.

2: Look for a big red tail after lots of green candles, which is a good indicator to pull out.

3: Buying the opposite of 2 :)

4: When BTC is low alts go up, visa versa.

9363 2018-01-04 14:09:26 @JonCooper22 Enjoy your articles.  Ripple - main criticisms are that it isn't BTC, i.e pre-mined, centralised etc.  None of those are necessarily evil.  Do you think there might be a place for a DMZ-like coin, i.e. between crypto and the banks?  The Switzerland of crypto?
9364 2018-01-04 14:09:24 Crypto enables us to opt into - and out of - financial governance systems. The key is autonomy, a linchpin of self-actualization and "happiness." Liquid democracy represents the next phase of human existence. Has our relationship as individuals within society ever mattered more?

9406 2018-01-04 14:07:28 Can someone actually articulate a claim stating ripple as a cryptocurrency/blockchain project? with no bs?
Otherwise it's not a competition/evolvement to projects that fundamentally embody the crypto archetype.
Why not call it a centralised shared database for banks?
9407 2018-01-04 14:07:22 I meant exactly the opposite. I think what you say is interesting, no need to organize giveaways. But I can understand the willingness to promote ;)
9408 2018-01-04 14:07:20 You made my day mate! I was hoping that this community it's not all about "moon" and "lambos" and u just proved it! Thank you very much for the good vibes and help to those kids, they are really in need of it. Keep it up, this makes u happy and u know it ;)

9417 2018-01-04 14:07:03 Haha honestly just trolling. I don’t really think that. But xrp is def not just a fidget spinner. It’s the future standard of crypto. Within a few years 100+ is very possible. Has nothing to do with MC

9428 2018-01-04 14:06:42 So i  took account actual all marketcap. Not a current circulating cap.  Or Ripple is on the old banking side on the other hands , BTC is the real new side. First time public  focused on ripple for some time,  and Gradual Re-flow will to real crypto like BTC. But "some time"is??
9429 2018-01-04 14:06:35 So I just bought Ripple, the crypto currency. I told my Mum what I had done and she said ‘why on Earth are you spending that much money on chocolate bars’  #Ripple #XRP

9451 2018-01-04 14:05:31 Richard - very prescient comments on how the Crypto space is seeing the same unregulated scammy behaviors which the stock market once saw.  Do you think this eventually leads to more regulation?
9452 2018-01-04 14:05:23 Already did today morning :p
9453 2018-01-04 14:05:22 It is, if you type the address on top into your browser, there is no mention of Tron on there. People love spreading FUD, all these types of lies do is cast doubt on a project, even if their intention is to push it higher.

Her following speaks for itself. She was one of the first in my feed with meaningful influence to start analysing crypto routinely.
9465 2018-01-04 14:04:34 As long as money keeps entering the crypto market that is a good thing. The market will decide where that money belongs as global adoption reaches a critical mass.
9466 2018-01-04 14:04:33 Current #bitcoin price: $14597.00 USD

9486 2018-01-04 14:03:31 Everything we have been fighting for in the last 9 years, decentralization, wide use in commerce etc has been destroyed by Blockstream and a bunch of fanatic followers. You can’t deny the reality of Bitcoin’s technical state today: absolutely terrible and completely preventable.

9535 2018-01-04 14:01:14 The surge is due to interest in BTC and crypto currencies. People are moving their fiat to blockchain. Another indication that it will continue to go up and much higher.

9541 2018-01-04 14:00:54 #Binance #crypto #XRP #ADA #XVG has it crashed?
9542 2018-01-04 14:00:53 In my opinion, xrp has been created for the bank in order to destroy crypto currencies. But to do it, they have to overcome BTC in marketcap. Then they will crash it and all crypto will follow. To me it’s the bank’s answer against crypto currencies.
9543 2018-01-04 14:00:44 Bitcoin Cash was a community effort to restore the original Bitcoin, and was eventually supported by a couple of bigger players. Bitcoin has never been more centralized now that people with smaller balances are forced to store their coins on exchanges, and stores are dropping it.

9545 2018-01-04 14:00:36 Maybe RBA should do its own #crypto currency?  Why not? Everyone else seems to be doing it.
9546 2018-01-04 14:00:32 Will check that out! Thanks!

9550 2018-01-04 14:00:19 $1 means a $65B+ valuation. $10 means $650B+ valuation. $1 is possible with time (especially given these bull runs). 10$ is almost the entire crypto market as of right now (siting at $760B+) so that may be a bit far away. I can see $2 potentially in 2018.

9566 2018-01-04 13:59:41 I agree. Crypto offers such a great opportunity for people who don't mind doing a little research.

9571 2018-01-04 13:59:23 Crustal movements might be happening now in Crypto-world.
9572 2018-01-04 13:59:21 Thank you for the info. I was under the impression that we can't do trading in crypto-currencies.
9573 2018-01-04 13:59:09 Good alternative on iOS is Coin Stats.
9574 2018-01-04 13:59:07 We can't be sure, until Apple approve it. That can take time, but it's risky to use iOS apps that are outside of the App Store. (ok, I know, crypto is risky..!)
9575 2018-01-04 13:59:06 Yeah I need something reliable as well.
9576 2018-01-04 13:59:04 How are your crypto investments doing?  What coins do you hold?  What's going on with the incubator.  What's the profitability margin on 6666 s9's?  So many questions left with the nr's.

9584 2018-01-04 13:58:27 People believe that Ripple will succeed, hence the investment dollars are pouring in. Crypto that can transfer coins from one wallet to the next is great, but the novelty wears off. We want real world useability in a decentralized currency.

9614 2018-01-04 13:56:10 Thank you for this  I'm currently trying hard to understand crypto, especially XRP. I assumed that the more coins will be released, the more will the price drop - in short term; going up again in long-term once XRP has enforced itself. 

But your explanation makes totally sense
9615 2018-01-04 13:56:10 I would do this except buy LTC and transfer through gdax

9683 2018-01-04 13:51:47 Yes, ETH has always been WAY ahead of anything else. Only kitties ever slowed it down. lol

Some people really don't like XRP, partially due to it not being a true blockchain crypto, and partly to do with banks associations. And some say btc has taken on a similar vibe.

9693 2018-01-04 13:51:16 Hey Crypto bee  thanks for the follow!
9694 2018-01-04 13:51:16 You are the worst kind of crypto investor. 1. You lie about your experience. Bitcoin came out in 2009. 2. You make Cryptocurrencies seem like a get-rich-quick scheme. 3. You FUD other coins for weird reasons?   4. You try to get followers by offering Raffles for Cryptos.
9695 2018-01-04 13:51:07 @JoelKatz i'm new to crypto and worked in Financial Services the majority of my life and am excited the disruption it can bring to this industry.... Q... Does Ripple have a price point where it would want to maintain a stable XRP price to eliminate volatility? If Yes, how far...

9708 2018-01-04 13:50:20 Thanks for the kind words Josef!
9709 2018-01-04 13:50:19 Why would you wanna support a coin that has so much negativity around him. Combined with the aweful community, I would say this is the shittiest billion dollar crypto around.

9727 2018-01-04 13:49:38 You're mostly correct. I think it's our duty to provide the truth and not a sensationalist/catchy version of it though. For an inexperienced investor that aims to invest in fundamentals, the crypto market is very confusing and full of false hype and scams.

9745 2018-01-04 13:48:49  IDIOTS! 
9746 2018-01-04 13:48:45 Yeah dude; blocktimes for BTC are nuts. Currently I recommend buying ETH or LTC, transferring that to wherever you want and then converting back to BTC. ETH over LTC if you are looking to buy another crypto since most places have ETH pairs.
9747 2018-01-04 13:48:44 Okay, looks like $TRX could potentially dump to 1000sats — be careful out there kids. Dangerous to buy right now.

9780 2018-01-04 13:46:38 Most overused phrase in #crypto land - “order of magnitude”. I learnt long ago if there’s an easier way to say something, one should be impervious and do so.
9781 2018-01-04 13:46:35 Do not expect to text me about crypto and ask me to do everything for you life does not work like that educate your self on what your interested investing in and have a knowledge behind it.. knowledge is power not money

9792 2018-01-04 13:45:33 I wish there was a weighted index of top 100 crypto and liquid enough options market referencing it. Maybe a good idea for a product. Crypto equivalent of SPY. Citadel could do MM, they don't give a shit as long as there's a buck to be made.
9793 2018-01-04 13:45:31 The simple fact you're considering Ripple tells me you're going to lose your house. Please don't mortgage your house. Invest only money you can afford to lose. Please do lots and lots of research before investing a lot of money in crypto. Just my 2 cents.
9794 2018-01-04 13:45:19 I guess it will during this altseason. Strong Team, great roadmap and a working product. One of the hidden gems.

9805 2018-01-04 13:44:37 yeah, but outside of crypto side channel attacks have been viewed as *way* too much cost / benefit. I'd go so far as to say it's explicitly ignored.

9815 2018-01-04 13:43:55 It's not about $crypto being wild. It's about idiots being everywhere , in #cryptoWorld as well. We all should report that account to @Twitter and make sure it is banned (with registration e-mail too).

9818 2018-01-04 13:43:47 The most underutilized resource on Earth is our untapped collective unconscious universal mind. Crypto is an expression of that phase-shifting love manifesting.
9819 2018-01-04 13:43:41 Should we wirry about crypto bubble if BTC climbs?
9820 2018-01-04 13:43:35 perhaps, but the transition will be anything but smooth. To think that the nations&institutions that back the worlds fiat will simply step down is also naive...crypto's act like commodities, not currency atm and are too volatile for to be vehicle for daily transactions

9859 2018-01-04 13:40:56 #Bitcoin price has quadrupled in less than four months. It easily could triple, quadruple during 2018. But also remember 85% drop Jan. to Oct. 2014, 33% drop Jan. 2017, 40% drops twice this past summer. Helps to remember why you are "invested" in #crypto. #Blockchain #HODL

9989 2018-01-04 13:32:42 Its called Crypto
Means you cannot find source for money

One way you have no money
Its like seeing gems in temple run
But even if you have 50k gems
You cant get real money

You have to run n run
And die
Also its the way hackers make real money
And sell world to some people.
