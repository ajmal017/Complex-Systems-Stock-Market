1 2018-11-08 23:52:45 Totally disagree. What helped us through the gfc is the main was record demand for our commodities out of China and CHCH rebuild. Not the mention the record  growth in the gap between rich and poor. Hard to celebrate an economy that only includes1/2 pop.

41 2018-11-08 22:30:57 Someone who retweets Deji Adeyanju's tweet all the time... You can't take idiots like that serious

They are commodities to dirty politicians... They've been paid for
42 2018-11-08 21:38:35 Players are rare commodities. He’ll get paid
43 2018-11-08 21:38:35 O otimismo depende do setor. Commodities por exemplo tão baratas, precificando peak cicle. Mercado interno andou bem e não tá barato olhando múltiplos correntes, mas a rapaziada quase não tem expansão de lucro pro ano que vem. Se a economia engrenar, vão ficar baratas.
44 2018-11-08 21:36:10 I agree all commodities are going lower but for me that’s easy because I think everything is going to decline substantially. I am shocked we are back over 2800 and looks higher short term.
45 2018-11-08 21:26:54 Seriously a great idea! My mom traded commodities and the money markets in 1970 - 1980 before the internet and live data... the only time we had a tv at the cottage! I wish I paid more attention
46 2018-11-08 21:23:36 god help the uk and it’s food industry . your mp’s (all) are so blindingly ignorant of basic geography and logistics of every day commodities. ireland uk grade is 1bn euro per week , and we barely get a mention 
47 2018-11-08 21:17:01 Your hate is ruining our country. Period. You spring from immigrants. Do you get that? Immigrants bring diversity, creativity, a work ethic that is to be admired. And animals deserve our love and protection, They are not commodities. What is it about hating that brings you alive?
48 2018-11-08 21:16:37 Putz, nova commodities  a ser explorada, com cotação em bolsa e tudo.
49 2018-11-08 21:13:02 Just look at NFL. Players really are just commodities and pieces of meat.
50 2018-11-08 21:13:01 Go long on agricultural commodities using a perfectly efficient market to leverage the hazard rate.
51 2018-11-08 21:12:12 Dolly you know as well as I that they are all that way. If you are a person of color, poor, handicapped etc. The powers that be will look down their nose at us. We are nothing more than expendable commodities
52 2018-11-08 21:10:50 This is such a disgusting way to look at humans, to think of them as fungible commodities.
53 2018-11-08 21:09:34 Neither perspective is more correct, nor more realistic. People who get paid to play a game cannot be underpaid. Players are fungible commodities - if - they are replaced en masse. People who get paid less than market value, regardless of occupation, are underpaid
54 2018-11-08 21:06:16 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.

60 2018-11-08 20:49:40 It's really sad that so many people let these leftist organizations like MoveOn, use them like cattle or commodities. They don't care what the cost is for you people. Yoy're usable and throw-awayable to them . Wake up.
61 2018-11-08 20:40:29 I have no problem with front offices in sports referring to players as assets or commodities. Not all players are replaceable but teams that cut emotional cord and do what is best going forward and not what happened in the past in most cases are setting themselves up for success.
62 2018-11-08 20:30:15 Isn’t it sad that we finally became commodities??
63 2018-11-08 20:20:00 Commodities update:

64 2018-11-08 19:55:02 Gun manufacturers believe that guns are commodities.

66 2018-11-08 19:50:08 It's horrible & an intrusion into their human rights
They are not commodities to be marketed

67 2018-11-08 19:44:06 I didn’t say you referred to players as assets or commodities...but I’ve heard plenty of your brethren do so. So I ask you, is a beer vendor an asset to an organization? Or just a mere means of acquiring a cold beverage?
Players for beer vendors?¿?
Come on Bill.

70 2018-11-08 19:35:15 Si esas empresas lo absorben de su rentabilidad, no me indigna. Pero seguro se traslada al resto de la sociedad por encarecimiento de los costos de financiamiento y baja en la cotización local de commodities. Eso sí me indigna.

74 2018-11-08 19:23:41 Rift Valley farmers should sell their maize directly to the open market, @UKenyatta @Williamsruto should stop dealing in commodities. After all Farmers in Kitui dont sell Ndengu to govt, Narok herders dont sell cattle to govt, Miraa isn't bought by govt.

Yup, they made these insane baseless #lies their tribal bellow."
102 2018-11-08 17:33:45 At the risk of "yeah, right" responses, I have friends with intimate knowledge/experience that stated this very thing for several years.  Without their approval, I hesitate to note which commodities/years.  

Based on these discussions, I question all official numbers from China.
103 2018-11-08 17:19:17 i think securities markets are highly sophisticated and commodities markets are highly reactive but i think real estate is slow and stupid.

105 2018-11-08 17:15:08 so gun control is actually a quagmire, there truly aren't a lot of good ways to regulate commodities that outnumber the fucking populace.

127 2018-11-08 16:09:30 You're right. I keep forgetting that political views have now become commodities to be marketed by their packaging, and most voters (and most of the press) feel no obligation to make any effort to examine the contents before buying.

187 2018-11-08 12:32:38 Commodity pricing is generally quite volatile which leads to volitile margins and earnings. Companies that sell commodities often swing from making money to losing money purely because of commodity prices. These companies usually don't have a moat.

233 2018-11-08 08:17:34 @Eusebius We don't "pay" Lobola/Magadi,rather we exchange Lobola or exchange cows because cows represent currency of wealth in African culture. The term "paying Lobola" objectify women as commodities.
234 2018-11-08 08:15:19 You forget that immediately before asking his 2, not 4, questions that lead to it, a colleague of his also wanted to ask another question, but that guy relented the second he saw Acosta was picked next, and the dude even said as much.

So maybe others like Jim Acosta's questions?

241 2018-11-08 07:45:01 Dude, this comment is so full of grammatical errors, it’s not even fair...

No. Trump is not the fire President to give himself credit after accomplishing something for the American people.

Secondly, how does acknowledging his own greatness compare to Acosta’s whining?
242 2018-11-08 07:44:39 Sir both please as I have never traded in commodities due to lack of knowledge.
243 2018-11-08 07:32:27 Yikes, that's a whole lot of comas. 
244 2018-11-08 07:31:12 I agree almost wholeheartedly, but I don't think ignoring Russia, a nation that is even today engaged in attacking us, is a smart move either.
245 2018-11-08 07:27:13 We have a middle class that’s shrinking, healthcare that is bad, endless wars in the Middle East and Jim wastes his time asking about Russia.
246 2018-11-08 07:27:05 It’s all about money and the limelight for owners. Horses are commodities for these people. Love of animals plays no part, no matter what they spout into a microphone. One day someone will have the courage to ban it ...
247 2018-11-08 07:25:00 Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

248 2018-11-08 07:23:16 In earlier cultures commodities such as cattle were used as money. Buyers took the value of the goods on trust when making a purchase. Today 2 money is a question of confidence, which we all lack on the bond note.

251 2018-11-08 07:15:02 Removing reporters who aren’t sycophants and ask legitimate questions is ultimately a threat to American values.  So too are voter suppression and gerrymandering.  Just because you like THIS president doesn’t mean allowing him to rig the system is wise.  You don’t know the future
252 2018-11-08 07:14:08 The president is only the president to get attention and praise on himself. Doesn't that make them soulmates??
253 2018-11-08 07:12:22 Allow me to paraphrase @AndrewGillum: “I’m not calling Mr. [Trump] a racist. I’m simply saying the racists believe he’s a racist.”
254 2018-11-08 07:10:46 You lose me there. If you're insinuating that reporting the things that actually come out of his mouth and can be easily seen and proven from multiple sources is "smear", then I can't get into that conversation.
255 2018-11-08 07:07:06 Just Acosta is an attention whore. Call it what you want, but he’s only near the President to get the camera on him.
256 2018-11-08 06:56:53 Now THAT is a fair thought. I agree to an extent. Where the conversation ended up was completely unnecessary. Insulting the guy after Jim just because he defended him a tad and saying he sucks too is pretty childish, don't you think?
257 2018-11-08 06:51:09 Current state of affairs in ph: price inflation so prices for basic commodities are going up here and there

Meanwhile they are only allowing 25PHP (roughly USD 0.5cents) nationwide salary increase for minimum wage earners  yes you read it right the increase aint even a dollar
258 2018-11-08 06:48:42 It's true but still government are not  helping matters in the area of price control for commodities. Because after the implementation of new minimum wage, price of commodities will be high, which will also be affecting the workers indirecting.

261 2018-11-08 06:39:54 And I do agree, critical minerals and commodities are extremely underinvested and undervalued right now. Now is the time to get into the sector. Upcoming copper deficit, US mineral independence, green energy explosion, cycle change, etc.
262 2018-11-08 06:39:21 Please check inflation index. price of essential commodities have fallen down like anything . If you multiply price hike with that of UPA with monthly household consumption, you will be surprised to note that @narendramodi has infact given more than 15 Lakhs

273 2018-11-08 05:01:35 Quite honestly not much a fan of horse racing either — but with both, my issue remains with the way some of the dogs and horses are mistreated, treated simply as commodities and then literally discarded.

reporting to feed one’s ego and ratings.
277 2018-11-08 04:32:55 You're right there are many greedy people. I listened to some at the senior center today talking about Dem socialists. Those same people are on medicaid & receive commodities. They have no clue that those are social programs. I receive none of that. But they do.

281 2018-11-08 03:50:16 El primer periodo de Menem fue muy bueno, y de los pocos que tuvo menos de 2 dígitos de inflación. El de Kirchner fue decente porque le entró una tonelada de plata de la soja y otros commodities que malgastó horriblemente él y CFK después #datazo
282 2018-11-08 03:48:58 We are all commodities now--some more valuable than others, of course.
283 2018-11-08 03:48:19 That is a very interesting perspective. I hadn't really thought about that, you are right though. It's a very disturbing.  We have become faceless commodities.

286 2018-11-08 03:05:15 Human beings arent commodities. Children arent parents’ property to trade or sell. Procreation is a miracle and we should not be interfering with nature if it means destroying life after we create it or traumatizing children. Children have rights! This is Wrong and SO SELFISH!

291 2018-11-08 02:22:48 I mean...what you're saying is that liberals should oppose statehood because we might vote the wrong way not because perpetual colonialism is inherently immoral and dehumanizes populations. This jusy reinforces, in the minds of libs, that we are just electoral commodities.
292 2018-11-08 02:06:02 12 guys got run. 11 of those had 9 or more minutes. CMM wanted to see everyone get extended playing time. When u have 9 underclassmen, that's a lot of unknown commodities. He obviously wanted some answers in regards to guys that won't play all that much.
