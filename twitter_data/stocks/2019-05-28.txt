1 2019-05-28 23:58:42 I haven’t posted about my stocks because the market has been lousy for months. I don’t know why people think the economy is so great.
2 2019-05-28 23:58:18 No, but I often feel a knife in my heart or cringe inwardly when contemplating some of my biggest blunders. These always occurred in the so-called defensive areas of health care and gold producers. #stocks #investing
3 2019-05-28 23:57:38 Labor gaining share will be terrible for stocks this time.
4 2019-05-28 23:57:10 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 15% Positive, with #NOT APPLIC 7% Positive. Stocks: $VEC was 18% Positive, with $SPX 9% Positive. #ASX
5 2019-05-28 23:54:45 pizza pasta put in a box
a healthy meal, with celery stocks
6 2019-05-28 23:54:09 Stocks just went up 
7 2019-05-28 23:52:33 New reader here, but that was my thought when reading this. The model must not be valuation driven? Looks like an EPS recession is looming. Doesn't guarantee stocks fall of course....
8 2019-05-28 23:52:07 I bought some $JD and $BIDU stock today.  Trump is meeting with Xi at the end of June.  China will eventually be the world's #1 economy. And these stocks are really on sale.

10 2019-05-28 23:50:52 Such a shame that all this wealth is "tied up" in the "stocks!"
11 2019-05-28 23:50:46 Or have 10 mil in the bank account and trade 10,000 in penny stocks daily.
12 2019-05-28 23:49:19 The exciting chart is $XII the New York Stock Exchange index of 75 most widely held Institutional stocks. 
3 Black Crows pattern. It suggests institutions selling every uptick and if low of previous 3 days is taken out there should be accelerated liquidation
13 2019-05-28 23:48:19 Very diverse. Real estate, stocks, bonds, annuities, mutual funds, etc.
14 2019-05-28 23:47:50 I want to see thirty years of Pelosi’s financial records, especially stock trades.

Does she buy/sell stocks just before a bill is introduced in the House, knowing the bills impact on certain stocks?

She’s worth north of $100,000,000.
15 2019-05-28 23:47:49 The private education & prison stocks have more than doubled.
I wonder why?
16 2019-05-28 23:47:13 Whether one takes fresh-money buys in here is a function of which factor one deems more important: the price/volume behavior of the major averages or the action of the leading stocks #stock
17 2019-05-28 23:47:13 So, I wonder how many in government are buying stocks low right now and when the China trade war ends will sell high and rake it in. Sound like a scam to me, and the average person is the loser
18 2019-05-28 23:44:17 Jigglypuff, I love how much control you have over her movement. Edgeguarding is super free flowing. Jablock sing is broken. Also having combos that overall can instantly delete stocks is super nice
