As more traders crossover to crypto, it should gain more use in this context

41 2018-05-10 23:33:52 Sometimes a share price goes too low because people "short them". To short a stock (sell what you do not have), there's a need for available stocks in the market that are not tied. I heard that when you place a sale order they can't borrow yours for that, or they have to buy back
42 2018-05-10 23:32:35 You understand Trump owns vast stocks in Phillips 66? And the Dakota oil pipeline than transports American crude? And he just pulled out of the Iran deal "because it was bad".  It artificially drove gas prices up and padded his pockets and interests. #hesgettingrich @POTUS

49 2018-05-10 23:22:54 It's been awesome watching my students researching investments this week, building their first investment portfolios!

52 2018-05-10 23:17:46 Exited $TIHYX. Reduced $WFC, $ENB and $DVA to 8.9%, 3.0% and 1.4% of single stocks. Increased $TILVX to 18.6% of assets. Cash + bonds are 13% of assets. Funds are 53% of equities - I'd prefer 60%, but doubt I can trade efficiently toward that anytime soon.
53 2018-05-10 23:16:26 Yup, stocks generally.

Think of it this way: If you buy one 30 delta put right now, a dealer will have to short 30 shares to hedge. Now assume that time has passed, but price is the same. Your put is now 15 delta. Between then and now, the dealer bought back 15 shares.

57 2018-05-10 23:12:52 Nikkei futures up 0.1% with yen at 109.4/USD. U.S. stocks rally to 7-week high as weak inflation data signals Fed won’t need to step up interest-rate hikes. Philippine Stocks volatility rise on "inpulse reaction" to yesterday's rate hike.
58 2018-05-10 23:11:32 Yes, unemployment rate & stocks have been trending up & not to forget the tax cuts either since President Trump was elected. Military changes & jobs returning to U.S.? Watch Fox. I agree, blind acceptance to the leftist Socialist Democratic party, CNN & MSNBC is ignorant.

61 2018-05-10 23:08:13 Aight man you do you. ~90% of americans want better gun regulation and ~80% want bump stocks banned. Regulation is not banning. The founding fathers also believed in slavery and not letting women vote but amendments changed that.
62 2018-05-10 23:07:05 Remember David, that this is the same company that's been fined over $76 BILLION due to it's corrupt and fraudulent practices since the financial crisis of 2008. In fact, they were fined $42M earlier this year due to fraudulent claims about how stocks were being handled.

80 2018-05-10 22:45:05 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim
81 2018-05-10 22:44:19 I was in WRS. From a social risk standpoint the winners and losers picking stocks and or bonds cluster in age cohorts. In 2008 almost *everyone* who retired that year had their equity cut in half. Likely, allowing a die-off would be politically unpalatable

I'm also glad he got rid of the ACA individual mandate.

His crackdown on bump stocks is also good.

126 2018-05-10 22:02:09 It all starts with the game itself. Smash 4 introduced For Glory, the first true 1v1 item-less online game mode, but made it 2 stocks instead of 3. 2 became the standard. The online doubles unfortunately had team attack off, so there wasn't an auto built in good way to practice
127 2018-05-10 22:02:01 #4. The dollar (as measured by the DXY) may be relatively unchanged since the start of 2018, at 93.1 vs. 92.1 but look at the chart and the story changes. In January, the greenback was in a downtrend (good for stocks and risk assets). Now, it seems unstoppable to the upside.
128 2018-05-10 22:01:36 Ban bump stocks !
129 2018-05-10 22:00:50 In other words, markets seem eager enough to buy back their book at year-end 2017 levels, but are less certain about any other price. More than four months of news flow and US stocks are essentially unchanged on the year.
130 2018-05-10 22:00:21 My timeline timeless summary

Apple trillion dollars market cap

EM growth still on target

In summary buy anything

255 2018-05-10 20:58:24 Something else that’s 1 trillion? How much energy stocks have gone up the last few days with trouble in Iran.
256 2018-05-10 20:57:14 I love Andrew
257 2018-05-10 20:55:18 Thanks. Is your sense that in cases where it's accounted for in models that mgmt measures haven't changed to reflect it or that something else is going on? I hear from some fishermen that if the stocks are bad it's a mgmt failure because they're just following what mangers say.
258 2018-05-10 20:55:17 Technology stocks rose, @Apple has added 15% so far this month, while @facebook and @Google parent company Alphabet have risen about 8%

Pretty much everything this CEO said would happen has happened, maybe not on time, maybe not the way you imagined, but they happened. Story stocks are very dangerous and most are good shorts, but this one...
264 2018-05-10 20:53:31 I actually would say it’s worth it in comparison, but requires more initial capital (and luck) then stocks

272 2018-05-10 20:52:16 Simple question.  When Trickle down economics are the model who are investing in the evonomy?  The answer the people who have the money aka the rich.  Most seem to be in stocks and not in job creation and middle and lower class wage increase.
273 2018-05-10 20:51:57 Finally interest rates are going up and savers can make some money again. And the corporations profits go to people like you and me who own stocks and bonds.  It's called capitalism, not socialism.

379 2018-05-10 19:50:16 It is up to you to ask "why?" Why would something that has happened in the past be expected to continue in the first place? Why?

Why? Why not?

403 2018-05-10 19:37:56 Price goes up the longer you wait. think of it as stocks
404 2018-05-10 19:37:32 @gee_trader I would take a different view.  For me stock selection is the hard part.  I agree knowing when to cut losses and run winners is also hard.  But identifying the great stocks at the start is also very difficult.  Only circa 5% of stocks are high quality "growth stocks."

408 2018-05-10 19:34:23 And of course the US military contractor / supplier stocks (Grumman Northrop, Raytheon, L3 Technologies, and others) start recovering after they took a hit of up to 10% directly after the Korea summit. I am sure Trumps portfolio profits nicely.

418 2018-05-10 19:25:59 The Clinton’s got rich buying pharmaceutical stocks as I’m sure you all did so now to complain about high prices seems a bit hypocritical.
419 2018-05-10 19:25:13 it can take awhile though, right? Especially when adjusting for inflation. Don't think stocks recovered from the Great Depression until well into the 50s...

422 2018-05-10 19:23:08 When you parrot words like "liberals" it shows you are a low thinker. You would also be able to know that the tax cut is temporary. Companies have bought back their stocks and if you look at history after every GOP is in office it leads to a recession. The tax cuts expire.
423 2018-05-10 19:21:47 Stocks discount the deltas in future #earnings expectations, not the past. 1Q18 represents the past & were baked into stock prices in 2017. To be a great stock picker, you need to be a 2nd level thinker. As Gretzky said, “skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.”
424 2018-05-10 19:21:44 correct, i trade OTCs, i dont pump and dump people into stocks with no liquidity with no update from a company that is deliquent in their filings meaning zero reasons to buy...low float stock and ppl like you w/ following tho, itll work for a bit

428 2018-05-10 19:19:01 Met with a fund manager in 2013 who said that was 100% his investment thesis. Buy bad news on big stocks, sell 6mo-1yr later. That kept him in the game, played with small stuff/interesting things on the side.
429 2018-05-10 19:18:45 kurt - i like your takes - but stay in your lane. This WAS NOT why stocks went up.

445 2018-05-10 19:06:52 Crude oil recovering today, and for the most part, the oil stocks are not. That's been the story of the last two years. There's gonna be a major reckoning, in my humble opinion, and some of these energy names are going to go for a RIP.

519 2018-05-10 18:23:41 Read the fear index of stocks volativity is dropping and it has steadly risen in the past few days. The bubble is being inflated at an increased rate. If this rapid expansion continues, then I fear people will vote with their bank accounts. Trump and his goons will be forgiven.

524 2018-05-10 18:21:48 Academic research shows women still more likely to invest in mutual funds run by men than they are women. And the academic research around performance of companies with women on the board and c-suit suggests neither out performance or under performance for those stocks. 1/2
525 2018-05-10 18:21:33 No right answer to anything in the market. 10 stocks at a time for me but it is inherently volatile so I’m thinking of moving to 15-20.  But the more you have the less time to understand each of them. Just like kids!

592 2018-05-10 17:46:39 Market Pulse: Market turmoil may be linked to such volatility leading to a further boost in HTF and within institutions. This is also linked to the incredible and broad retreat in stocks from the “fat finger” trading in future contracts

629 2018-05-10 17:32:11 Such a great saying  (as WB stuff usually is). Many Stocks might look very sensible and potentially Profitable to sell Short Term but when seen on Longer time frame they are a bargain.

642 2018-05-10 17:27:23 Presumably the canary in the coal mine to this view would be LLS and SGC, mars diffs (v wti and brent) and crushed cracks? Empty crude stocks in the US would require higher imports, as well as lower crude runs.

757 2018-05-10 16:33:49 US Equities looking good, broke a lot of resistance this week. Happy and sad about this. Trading US stocks in Asia is so awkward due to the time difference - market opens at 8:30pm. My social life might take a massive hit if the long term uptrend resumes.
758 2018-05-10 16:33:00 39k by end of 2019?
Could go this way: 80-100k by end of 2018. Dotcom bubble like marketcap and huge global meltdown of stocks and cryptos and stuff. After 6-9months of bear market in 2019 recovery starting and btc from 20k back up to around 39k by end of 2019.....exaggeration?
759 2018-05-10 16:32:53 USDA expect a 23% drop in US maize stocks in 18/19. That puts the global grain market in an interesting place it hasn't been in for a while.
760 2018-05-10 16:32:26 the china (and therefore world) corn stock story is incredibly confusing. 

YoY China changes:

Domestic use:  +8 MMT
Exports: unch

Stocks:  down 19 MMT
761 2018-05-10 16:32:18 so china ending stocks account for 49% of the projected yoy decline in global corn ending stocks

771 2018-05-10 16:30:26 Thought for today - Be careful about continually raising expectations/targets on stocks.  When a stock rallies so high that you can hardly believe it, it’s most often a good time to start locking in some profit.

781 2018-05-10 16:25:39 no dividends as of now (like most stocks) and these have no voting rights (although we want to figure it out but the tech isn't available yet to do it in sustainable and confident way).

783 2018-05-10 16:25:33 @AnilSinghviZEE @porinju looking at current trend and results its clear that if organised retail has to grow post GST then we cannot ignore FMGC / consumption stocks. stock even at cmp is looks good for long term
784 2018-05-10 16:25:17 Anytime volatility is below 12 the means the mkt is trending strongly, (@ least in the short-term right now). In strongly trending markets, the volatility is betn 9-12.  Spread Trades don't do well in a low volatility environment.

798 2018-05-10 16:22:05 Where do you find a good screener for the US stocks? Sa PSE, I can just scan almost all of them because we just have 300 or so stocks-- but with US stocks, thousands.
799 2018-05-10 16:22:01 No real idea what this is about, but I can guess. What a retailer stocks is, quite literally, the retailer's business. Customers have no right to purchase any particular item; they can and should shop elsewhere if they don't like the selection.
800 2018-05-10 16:21:53 Simple. You give top 1% all the money & Corps get a huge tax break to buy back stocks & up CEO pay. To keep tax scam going, Corps hand out “one time” bonuses & tiny raises. Then you praise the tax scam as “working.” All the while target social svcs to “reduce” debt you created!
801 2018-05-10 16:21:20 Corn - lower US & world carryout next year supportive.
Soybeans - surprise in next year's lower US carryout, but expect attempt at big South American production next year.
Wheat - monthly reminder the world has too much.
Cotton - keep waiting for USDA to raise exports/cut stocks.

842 2018-05-10 16:10:38 It might be sacrilegious to say this, but the recent boom of "buy on breakout" strats with newbies in PH stocks seems to have produced more losses than win, especially since the downtrend started and there have been more fakeouts than true breakouts. Amirite?

As far as I'm aware, short is not an asset class or strategy offered by mainstream managers controlling the world's wealth through mutual pools.Have you ever seen "short" offered as a 401k plan?

1163 2018-05-10 14:16:30 NYH cash creeping up to evens - other padd cash firmish - R/R points to ownership on June/July. At minimum I would be rolling my shorts to July RB - Granted higher flat price is going to hit demand somewhere and we got a lot of stocks to cover. Love to hear opposing POV

1165 2018-05-10 14:16:01 Common Sense is a myth. Everybody thinks they have it, but that nobody else does.

1) What's an assault weapon?
2) Which accessories (besides bump stocks) don't belong in the hands of civilians?
3) What other gun laws are "Common Sense"?
4) Do you have any thinking of your own?

1302 2018-05-10 13:21:30 This makes it even more important to subtract China's stocks from the world stocks to see "effective" supply. USDA plans to start doing this very soon, possibly with the June report.
1303 2018-05-10 13:20:35 The USDA attaché report out of Beijing from early April. You can access it on USDA's GAIN database. Glen, I looked at last year's report (reflected big corn stocks drop in CN) and USDA went with that in its May WASDE. The numbers might not be identical but very similar.

Stocks in general are down for the year to date. So unless they have some superstar fund manager they're just making it up.

And of course, a lot of these idiots don't realize most of their profit in 401k is company match, not market gains.

1345 2018-05-10 13:06:32 Despite rising energy prices, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in below estimates, with falling prices on used cars and airfare contributing to lower-than-expected inflation numbers. That takes pressure off the Fed's likelihood of increasing interest rates, and helps stocks.

1418 2018-05-10 12:29:42 Italian Stocks Fall, Bond Yields Rise as Political Worries Increase

1419 2018-05-10 12:29:26 I think the point is that market liquidity in people's portfolios is always provided for at a price. There's no limiting factor in the system preventing every household from switching all of their money into stocks and all of it back into cash (ALA middlemen make a profit).

1427 2018-05-10 12:24:32 Yes but depends on the asset. In stocks, bonds, or real estate, the supply estimates are much more accurate, which is one fewer variable when predicting price.  Gold is especially opaque, which is why cries of manipulation are common.

1557 2018-05-10 10:43:40 you got me wrong.  we hold such stocks in our pf without too much fuss or philosophising.  All stocks have their own utility in their own place.   BTW stocks like HEG Rain etc are not what you call 'trends' they are up due to strong fundamental triggers.

1622 2018-05-10 09:24:34 I also think a stock game where buying and selling stocks doesn't affect price is a bit weird. I felt there was a bit of a disconnect between the rondel actions and the prices.

1623 2018-05-10 09:23:35 off course you have to invest to earns more and get a better business. But money is not endless. So the decision from stocks is to remove some coins with no income.

1701 2018-05-10 08:05:56 From when I started looking at AIM shares there were and still are many accounts saying particular stocks will bag within a year. Safe to say not one of these stocks has even come close to a single bag.
1702 2018-05-10 08:05:42 I did not recommend any of those stocks because those are bad investments according to me.
1703 2018-05-10 08:05:40 When there is no volume, stocks has no income from it. But they have a lot of work for it. So high personal costs and no revenue.

I dont know if you familiair with running a business?? But when there are high costs and los revenue, you dont survive.
1704 2018-05-10 08:05:17 EXACTLY THATS the point I was saying to you. These are underperforming companies and thats why stocks will always be underperformers and bad investment choices. Change of ownership will bring revival chances.

2028 2018-05-10 03:28:15 @jimcramer I need some clarification on the concern about the 10 year hitting 3%... based on the rule of 72 .. it would take 24 years for your money to double. doesn't sound like a great rate of return compared to stocks.
2029 2018-05-10 03:28:14 The ban is unnecessary and created a space for unregulated alternatives.  The only way to truly end rapid firing firearms is a ban on possession of semi-autos and that would lead to a revolution.  Ending the demand for bump stocks by legalizing and regulating machine guns,....

2034 2018-05-10 03:26:18 President Trump's decision to restart sanctions on Iran has lifted oil prices and energy stocks.
2035 2018-05-10 03:25:50 I love this misconception. Most people just want common sense things like banning bump stocks and stronger background checks. That really is the middle ground. Compromise is very nearly extinct in America today.

2041 2018-05-10 03:23:59 Not necessarily. Memory sales are still strong but other types are showing signs of a top. Stocks can diverge from fundamentals but the rate of change in growth is definitely slowing.

2121 2018-05-10 02:46:28 My take is that Capcom doesn't need SNK to make a game similar to CVS2.  The parts people enjoy about CVS2 are not the SNK characters, but the gameplay.  SNK doesn;t have a patent on rolls/super stocks/rage.  In fact I'd rather they just do that.  Let's not ruin SNK cast again.

2156 2018-05-10 02:14:56 I have seen the outcome of a lot of shootings in my 20 years downtown, bump stocks weren’t involved in any that I have heard of.  One guy in Vegas using it was the 1st time I had even heard of them.  We need to get the guns out of the hands of criminals!
2157 2018-05-10 02:14:55 @Ryan_trader87 Hi Ryan. Which broker are you using to trade those US stocks? Been wanting to@follow Tim for a while but can’t find a broker. Send me a DM if you prefer. Thanks.
2158 2018-05-10 02:14:43 In a bout of deja vu, the NRA plans to sell some AR-15s and bump stocks to the Iranians to fund some anti-Noriega mercenaries. .  .
2159 2018-05-10 02:14:27 Did "Mike Wilkins" blame small group of advisors for the failings at AMP Limited (ASX: AMP)? But didn't this go all the way to the top? Doesn't he believe fish rots from the head? Can AMP change culture with this attitude? #AMP #investing #ASX #stocks

2167 2018-05-10 02:09:56 brother, for these double tops and bottoms on these high priced stocks, do you make sure the stock touches the bottom or top to a penny (like exactly the same price) or is it just a rejection at that area
2168 2018-05-10 02:08:41 It’s not about law abiding gun owners, stop spinning. It’s about bump stocks and better backgrounds checks, about not allowing criminals, terrorists and crazy people buy guns . You can go to gun shows and buy an AR-15 with no background check.
2169 2018-05-10 02:08:20 What make you think that?
2170 2018-05-10 02:05:23 Sir, can we expect the unexpected in 2019?

2180 2018-05-10 01:58:48 My reply will be several back to back posts.  Bump stocks exist because of the ABSOLUTELY unnecessary machine gun registration ban of 1986.  In 1934, the National Firearms Act was passed.  This established that machine guns, short barreled rifles and shotguns, suppressors.....
2181 2018-05-10 01:57:39 ATT...shareholders are angry, our stocks are falling and now we find out how corrupt you are..if only this came out before the stock holder's meeting

2184 2018-05-10 01:54:43 European stocks rose Wed to a 3-month high, helped by a rally for energy stocks as oil prices gained. BP surged 3.9%, Shell jumped 3.4% and Total climbed 1.9% as crude oil rose by nearly 3% in response to US sanctions on Iran, while Siemens leapt 3.9% and BNP Paribas added 1.1%
2185 2018-05-10 01:53:41 Occidental leapt 5.4%, @exxonmobil jumped 2.4% and @Chevron gained 1.7%, while among the technology stocks Alphabet, owner of @Google , advanced 2.9% and @facebook added 2.1%. In the banks, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and @GoldmanSachs jumped 2% or more.
2186 2018-05-10 01:53:01 US stocks rose on Wednesday, booking a fifth straight gain, and the broader market rallied as sharp gains in energy, financial and tech stocks propelled the main benchmarks firmly higher.

2188 2018-05-10 01:49:47 @Yahtzeeee @stockybulls yep, roll it into an ira. You can trade individual stocks there. You can roll it into a TD account
2189 2018-05-10 01:49:33 Truely would be disappointing if it's just random pictures that don't mean anything.
2190 2018-05-10 01:48:59 @elgatogaming You should probably update your list of vendors for the HD60Pro. Your store is literally the only one that actually stocks it anymore (amazon is third party sellers hiking the price up).

Just saying. >_<
2191 2018-05-10 01:48:41 You cannot own an automatic weapon unless you have a license.

They are not expensive, they are illegal (barring a license, bump stocks should be too)
2192 2018-05-10 01:48:41 FWD P/E back to reality, stimulus for next 18 mo’s from tax cuts, patient Fed, stocks will outperform FI if inflation surprises to the upside. Fed can’t raise 2 fast bc no fiscal stim n event of rec, & already out of MP ammo. Not a bargain, but case can be made 4 further upside.
2193 2018-05-10 01:48:11 1. Never self file. There's a reason patients come to you and don't read Harrison.
2. Get the maximum IT rebates possible in all sections. That's what a good CA is for.
3. Invest wisely. ULIPs, SIPs and MFs at least if not stocks.
2194 2018-05-10 01:46:55 Yea no kidding...We are making enough on our stocks retirement will never be a problem...!
2195 2018-05-10 01:46:42 That proves , market to remain sideways or choppy .. go for individual stocks ?
2196 2018-05-10 01:46:11 Invest in some stocks , build a brand or something it’s different ways to get money now and days
2197 2018-05-10 01:45:33 I never said it is better.  In fact, I,m sure that most people would want the real thing if they could afford it rather than accessories.  By making the real ones cheaper, it would render bump stocks obsolete which is my point.

2199 2018-05-10 01:43:36 I think the speech about stocks is one of the most important scenes of the movie, it's Royalton's "art" and he's giddy talking about it. But he's willing to cheat and bully to "succeed" at it, which is why he's the bad guy and such a good foil for Speed, IMO
2200 2018-05-10 01:43:18 The corrupt billionaires colluding wit central banks to buy back their own pumped up stocks with negative interest rate loans are on da hook 4 eating out of garbage duty... The rest providing value & not rent seeking are free to go...
2201 2018-05-10 01:42:43 Why do you think that bump stocks are better than automatic weapons.

Without the loop hole why would you make them?
2202 2018-05-10 01:42:32 While I still LOVE stocks $ES_F $NQ_F $YM_F, I continue to own puts against long outrights. I also continue to own #Gold $GC_F, #VIX $VIX, #Swiss $CHF, #Yen $JPY & #USTreasuries $ZN_F. I think those 5 products are the best trades out there to hedge against #FEAR. It will be back.
2203 2018-05-10 01:41:36 I'm not saying that their should be any regulation on bump stocks.  I'm simply saying that a clean legalizing (and regulating) of machine guns as they are currently defined will render bump stocks pointless essentially.  The only reason I used the word "clean" previously is to...

2219 2018-05-10 01:26:04 I still think #Copper $HG_F is going to be one of the best trades long for 2018. With commodities like #Oil moving higher, stocks moving higher, and cmdty currencies itching to move higher ( like $CAD ) - there is a lot of potential catalysts once "infrastructure" picks up again.

2233 2018-05-10 01:17:54 Buffett does make a fair point that commodities are not value producing assets and thus in his opinion, are not as good an investment as a business, farm, etc. However, even if BTC is like a commodity, most altcoins are similar to stocks, they just happen to spend like currency.
2234 2018-05-10 01:16:38 If Vodafone entry in India through Hutch was a big disaster to happen, a similar possibilities now for Walmart through flipkart.

Amazon built its Indian business for $3bn. Walmart values flipkart at $20.77bn. Can get better return by buying Amzn stocks for this sum.

2250 2018-05-10 01:05:09 why don't you adapt the market maker way of taking some off gradually into the move? You gotta compromise if you want to push size in stocks right?
2251 2018-05-10 01:03:49 Nothing hurts like losing money when stocks are ripping to the upside.  Lesson learned from 2017 and January 21018.  I did not make a killing today like everyone else on Twitter says they did.  But I didn’t lose money either.

2268 2018-05-10 00:50:03 I still don't get what you are trying to say. Machine guns are still legal to own. Bump stocks also don't make one trigger pull fire multiple rounds. Therefor not machine guns.
