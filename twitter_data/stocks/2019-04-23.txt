4 2019-04-23 23:57:36 What is concerning is that a recent freedom of information act request was made for the names and addresses of those who did send in their bump stocks for the $150. The person gave a false name, but that doesn't prevent a FOI request. The GOA have got a temporary stay on it, but

40 2019-04-23 23:50:18 Tell that to all the people who had to pay taxes. You were good to all those who are lucky enough to be able to afford stocks etc.
41 2019-04-23 23:50:05 Seems to be the case. Yet AAPL & QCOM driving the market up. $IBB type stocks coming up off their corrections. I’m having a hard time finding valid buy points.
42 2019-04-23 23:49:53 Stocks close at all time high; oil at 6 month high. Does the economic expansion have legs to keep running?
43 2019-04-23 23:49:35 Most people don't have the money to buy stocks. Why would they care about your rich friends getting richer?
44 2019-04-23 23:48:36 Yeah, stocks are selling in the hopes that you WILL be impeached not to mention the stock market has been reaching record highs for over four years now; the last President just didn’t talk about it all the time. He was busy being....well being President.
45 2019-04-23 23:47:28 RICH PPL own stock . You know 1% that got those tax cuts that were gonna trickle down to us common folk but they decided to buy back their stocks making themselves even richer. You know what else has hit all-time record high & keeps climbing under your watch ... the deficit!
46 2019-04-23 23:47:08 Got my stocks looking good
47 2019-04-23 23:47:05 Also what industries do you feel are being treated well? As far as compensation, work life balance, healthcare and retirement? The American workforce used to provide that but now we are a shareholders/corporate economy. They don’t care about employees they care about stocks.
48 2019-04-23 23:46:42 ASF represents the interests of anglers who kill wild Atlantic salmon for sport. So be it. Yet they literally focus their "conservation" efforts on trying to kill a farming industry that produces sustainable seafood, decreasing pressures on wild stocks.  Seems hypocritical to me.

55 2019-04-23 23:45:12 Each and every Dirtbag Democrat in Congress and elsewhere who bad mouths our President, should give their IRA and/or stock funds to the Republicans; stocks have increased tremendously ever since President Donald J Trump has been PRESIDENT!!!

57 2019-04-23 23:43:41 ... .. in stockmarket on stocks they already know are huge money makers. THEY ARE ALL DISHONEST!
58 2019-04-23 23:43:40 A poem should be revolving and tarry
As an unwrapped accounting,

Operating
As trial uprisings to the stocks,

Favourable as the blooded fundraiser
Of revolving matrons where the forefront has nodded--

A poem should be uncooperative
As the snapshot of universities.
