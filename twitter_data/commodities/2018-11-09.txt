11 2018-11-10 22:05:24 Well actually in terms of euro and dollars most commodities including crude oil, gold etc were actually cheaper in 2016 compared to 2007. That is usually what happens when most economies around the world aren't doing very well.

36 2018-11-10 21:14:12 Marx indeed recognized Capitalism as "the epidemic of overproduction...Because there is too much...means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce." Basically he meant that while Capitalism can PRODUCE large quantities of commodities, it fails to DISTRIBUTE them.
37 2018-11-10 21:08:40 Why do u talk of things we don't see as ordinary citizens? 
We want u to address bread &butter issues Prof. 
Prices of commodities and our salaries are not making sense at all. 
U hv to address that as a matter of urgency pse.
38 2018-11-10 21:06:53 Historically, futures are an omen across commodities. 

I don't see Bakkt as something comparable to that, but I'm open to being wrong.

40 2018-11-10 20:54:28 Congratulations to you God give us two essential commodities(TIME AND ENERGY) and you use them correctly to inspire those young ladies I'm proud of you madame keep it
41 2018-11-10 20:50:47 What in the world are we to do without carbon based commodities...... most life here on the prairies may as well just roll up and die ..... I know I could become a farmer!! That’s easy!!  so I’d say I agree. Lol
42 2018-11-10 20:46:08 Just as we also heard about what happened after @MBuhari overthrew Shagari in the 80s and pple startes queueing up for essential commodities; one man being associated with inflation and recession in the 80s and now again isn't coincidence. A failure is a failure any day any time.
43 2018-11-10 20:40:16 I thought it was season 1 ep 3 commodities but the jacket threw me a little so I'm not do sure
44 2018-11-10 20:39:59 Points (noun, plural) -- valuable commodities which will be produced in large quantities in #Bedlam
45 2018-11-10 20:39:57 That all would have been extremely late 1 st rounders. Ill take proven commodities all day  long over 4 late firsts.
46 2018-11-10 20:38:22 Amazon's leverage is not counterfeits (except for commodities like cords). You can't counterfeit an iPhone like, say, a luxury purse. The leverage is used Apple products, which do compete with new products. Given Apple's strategy is based on price hikes, this is a real threat.
47 2018-11-10 20:36:28 I see this Ad in so many ways and none are good. I want sure if the meaning when I first saw it. #ThesePeopleAreSick Children are not commodities for any reason. She deserves a chance at life.
48 2018-11-10 20:18:21 Academics are market-oriented intellectuals whose goal is to turn all human potential into capitalist commodities.
49 2018-11-10 20:17:09 It is very disturbing to me that #eyecon treats you all so poorly.  It seems like you are all commodities to them and not human beings.  I am very excited to be attending the fwbenefits event for St. Jude in February and to be in the presence of all of you wonderful people.

52 2018-11-10 19:54:49 In the end it doesn’t matter where we are relative to 2014.   It’s a mugs game trying to place forward guidance on algos .   Every bear market bottom is always different even with same assets.   Seen this discussion with stocks, metals, commodities for decades.
53 2018-11-10 19:52:39 The guy that claims he has veterans on his top priority, sees them as commodities to his goals. He is as phony as he is a con artist on civility.
54 2018-11-10 19:52:35 e.g. fund's economists expect inflation to overshoot expectations, AND assign high odds to the new ECB president being an ultra dove => rebalance in favor of commodities.
55 2018-11-10 19:46:52 Essa ideia desenvolvimentista na realidade não faz sentido; você aumenta a disponibilidade de produtos e a competitividade aumenta, se a indústria local for mais ineficiente que as externas a gente foca onde temos vantagem comparativa (commodities). Especialização não é ruim.

58 2018-11-10 19:28:50 Uma questão para Paul Guides tem como fazer o Brasil um país desenvolvido com o  liberalismo sendo que o país vive  exclusivamente de commodities de soja e boi? O petróleo já está vendido para Shell e Exxon, o minério tá perdendo mercado para países da África.

62 2018-11-10 19:04:08 Yeah at one point the spice girls were the biggest group too. Sadly for them, I think having Simon in your corner is important when pretty girls who can sing, aren't rare commodities.
63 2018-11-10 18:56:39 New road and bridge materials and contractors to bid for infrastructure jobs. A microelectronics company working to simulate generalizable human cortex within a chip. Contractors to install the new grid and telecom system. Go up the supply chain from there. Look at commodities.
64 2018-11-10 18:53:42 Suggesting people barter with commodities is not really creating a currency, but it is certainly doing something.
65 2018-11-10 18:40:13 EXACTLY!!
2% is Just The Beginning—Of HEALTHY Rising Rates!

As The Economy Continues to Grow—Interest Rates, the Dollar, Bond Yields & Premium Growth Stocks—Will Also Rise—As Bond Prices, Commodities ( Gold, Corn, Oil Etc) & Weak Stocks—Decline!

70 2018-11-10 18:06:45 There’s no correlations between consumer prices among commodities and wage index’s. They aren’t even a reflection of the same concept. 

Wages neither reflect skill nor man-hours; commodities don’t reflect economic realism. Google post scarcity and automation.
71 2018-11-10 18:06:31 What commodities do you trade?  If you believe Charlie, I’m guessing organic fertilizers.

73 2018-11-10 18:02:58 That's rubbish. There are dogmatic folk in all walks of life, but veganism itself is an aspiration to avoid harming animals when it's reasonably possible to do so, and a rejection of the animals-as-commodities view which sees sentient creatures live and die as production units
74 2018-11-10 18:00:15 Tem outra coisa, o período de crise no Brasil piorou um pouco p os amadores, aí entra a pressão psicológica, apanhar traumatiza ... aí os portos seguros ficam sendo os bancos e commodities...
75 2018-11-10 17:58:36 UST ylds flat to down (pinned there by Fed), USD down big, gold up big, commodities up big, US stocks limit up for days at a time, US & global economic activity/order books explode higher, centered on production in US & consumption in Asia.
76 2018-11-10 17:53:46 Yes u r right because now petrol become 84 rs / L, LPG cooking gas rs 1200 / cylinder, 1 US $ = RS 75 , price of essential commodities touched  to sky, Unemployment rate at highest.Vow great changes.
77 2018-11-10 17:36:22 Boom petrolero:

1) Producción de hasta 3.5 millones de barriles diarios, turbo inyectando nitrógeno a Cantarell.
2) Precio del barril de petróleo en 120 dlls por barril durante el súper ciclo de commodities.
3) Mucho menor importación de derivados del petróleo (i.e, gasolinas).
78 2018-11-10 17:33:33 Kids carrying knives is worse than Government sanctioned murders of vulnerable human beings? 

Nope 

Perhaps if we had a society that respected humans instead of commodities those kids would be less prone to stabbing each other.
79 2018-11-10 17:21:02 A heady combination! You sure are dumb if you believe the World's Best Commodities Trader is your President.

80 2018-11-10 17:16:25 All that the BJP last resort was to show that the economy had improved, and in doing so increased the price on petrol and important commodities, and I doing so lost the faith of the country . Overconfident Modi, brought BJP to a grinding halt. Manmohan is better then Jaitley.
81 2018-11-10 17:07:07 My value book is better described as pro inflationary names I think !! -- ultimately people will flock to.  Commodities I've never seen cheaper relative to glamour -- well they are cheaper than the 2000 highs.  
We have an extremely pro - inflationary president,  as well.

84 2018-11-10 16:58:39 Let's not forget increased prices of food and drink (highest margin commodities in this establishment). Present me the numbers that legitimately show balance in this regard. You cant pay a few employees $10 more an hour and expect me to believe it doesnt GROSSLY increase profits.
85 2018-11-10 16:56:06 Tangai madzisa maprices ema basic commodities, reverse the 2c per 1$ tax then maybe we might take you seriously
86 2018-11-10 16:54:40 Labor is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities.
87 2018-11-10 16:46:28 I’m not usually one to run rampant with ones word choices, but things do have different meanings. Monopolizing isn’t just trades and commodities, can also be in addition to conversation.
88 2018-11-10 16:46:27 Claro que não sabe. Brasil nunca deixou de ser colônia. Um país que possui mais de 500 anos de história ainda tem como principal pauta de exportação produtos primários, como as commodities. É preciso um presidente que imponha essa mudança, mas sem negligenciar os outros setores.
89 2018-11-10 16:46:19 24 months of "investigations" all based on the Best Commodities Trader in the World's failure to concede on Election Night which we were told would destroy the Republic if Donald did it... where was I? Right, @johnpodesta made this lie up. Let Mueller waste more money. Who cares?
90 2018-11-10 16:38:31 You want to cut us off for the mismanagment of FEDERAL land? I say we cut you off from all California commodities, many of which we are the SOLE producers of for the US. Say goodbye to almonds, olives, artichokes, dates, pistachios, raisins, walnuts. #heartless #eatshit
91 2018-11-10 16:30:49 A #JPMorgan trader has been spoofing the precious metals market (Gold/Silver/etc) but SOMEHOW..JP Morgan can still trade commodities, they are talking about using #Ethereum , and nobody is truly being held accountable..?  oooo the world we live in...  #bitcoin #money #fraud
92 2018-11-10 16:28:36 @C3_Nik @XRPTrump Speculation aside. This is the future of this technology in today’s terms. ILP will act as the “WWW.” For the internet of value and #XRP will act as “HTTP” for fiat, commodities, securities, etc. DLT and Private blockchains will access through interoperability.
93 2018-11-10 16:24:21 Partnerships aside. ILP will be the “WWW.” For the internet of value. #XRP will be the HTTP for fiat, commodities, securities, etc. it’s all about interoperability through DLT and Private blockchains. This isn’t speculation, it’s the tech behind the future of what this really is.
94 2018-11-10 16:17:23 This is where the failure of UEC shows most.  3 great commodities doing great and they are $0.13 from their 52 week low and close to their all time lows.  Notice they will not explain this.  But, it shows their corp positions and overall management skills have FAILED.  Right?
95 2018-11-10 16:15:12 That one small sef. Why did they not complain of inflation effects when fuel price was increased from 87-147. That single act increased d prices of commodities across board. How do they want to grow an economy without purchasing power. Who will produce goods nobody can buy
96 2018-11-10 16:08:47 It’s too bad a farmer can’t set their own prices for commodities. I would guess if urban residents had some of the cost of their legislation coming out of their pockets they might not be so quick to vote for it or for those who introduce and pass such legislation.
97 2018-11-10 16:03:54 You need to do inflation adjusted version of it, which is impossible, because SU didn't have market based prices. You are comparing apples to oranges. You should compare raw production numbers, preferably for commodities, like grains, like I did.
98 2018-11-10 15:59:15 @ImranKhanPTI please, reduce prices of commodities, electricity, gas and petroleum, even if you have to cut down developmental budget. keep in mind people are not concerned about macro development but their minor issues related to prices, education and health etc.
99 2018-11-10 15:55:38 When U don't have enough forex as a result of low oil price, U compensate by exporting or improving on d export of other commodities U have (solid minerals, processed agric products, etc) Banning dose items by fiat did a huge damage 2 d economy.
100 2018-11-10 15:53:22 Next time someone pick up a commodity business, just remember, in commodities, even a quarter is too long a time period for things to change, forget about year.
101 2018-11-10 15:49:53 The problem with broken logic like this is it’s easy for people to understand; that’s why you have so many likes. Raising the minimum wage does not drive inflation nor does it raise the cost of commodities like oil. Good grief.
102 2018-11-10 15:49:31 This is true of most smartphone components. They are disaggregated commodities.
103 2018-11-10 15:48:24 Eua tem muito consumo interno, br é praticamente uma maquina de exportação de commodities
104 2018-11-10 15:37:52 I have been heavily focused on DAPPS recently, which I firmly believe will be the catalyst for mass adoption. This is how blockchain and digital commodities will begin to entangle itself into society and cement itself into our everyday lives.
105 2018-11-10 15:37:26 PP, I love the Rush.  She is exactly right.  As you know we have stressed UUUU and Western since there are 2 commodities that are taking off  in U&V.  UEC has both plus Titanium or TiO2 which also went up 500% in 2 years. So, they have 3 commodities that have all done really well
106 2018-11-10 15:34:31 “like Japan & Russia before it, China’s economic “miracle” is anything but.

China deleveraging is going to be the most important macro driver of markets in yrs ahead. Emerging markets, commodities, precious metals & dollar…will all be affected by it”

@LukeGromen doesnt get it!
107 2018-11-10 15:13:29 Entendo e concordo. Porém o país poderia/deveria explorar as demais cadeias deixando de ser somente exportador de commodities, isso que acho triste. Afinal como você bem disse temos inúmeras vantagens e nada exploradas. 
108 2018-11-10 15:11:16 Exactally my point, the market has determined that longer season corn is best even with carbon tax, increasing drying costs. So in some ways when it comes to some commodities in a "average" year we could reduce our carbon tax load but economics still make the tax paletable.
109 2018-11-10 15:10:41 The mobile communication costs were down almost by 80%.
No fluctuations in prices of any essential commodities in the last 4 years
110 2018-11-10 15:08:17 I mean if RBA cuts not all will flow through to bank funding...I can imagine AUS/USD falling to 45 if commodities sell off at same time housing does

Why are commodities missing in shops?
Why are suppliers demanding foreign currency for them to import essential commodities?@edmnangagwa
113 2018-11-10 14:45:42 So he should have let your people kill others because you were in your fatherland as per those ones were in their motherland? If only common sense were as cheap as the commodities y'all sold would have said go buy one. You value ur rights but happily trample on others. Mad people

  3. VOTE : Atiku Abubakar ( GCON ) 4 president 2019.
115 2018-11-10 14:43:27 Pretty sure commodities are telling you what you need to know.
116 2018-11-10 14:24:20 Why don't you reveal how much inflation was there in commodities again in terms of euro from. 2007 to 2016.
117 2018-11-10 14:23:36 i tried to read it and its way worse than the equivelent shit that used to be their jam, like Dawkins, Diamond, and all those books that are histories of particular commodities (Salt, etc)
118 2018-11-10 14:15:13 Hahahahaha my in ooomention some of this commodities 
119 2018-11-10 13:42:41 dear people with their bios including edible commodities, yes, even I relate my existence with food.
120 2018-11-10 13:30:51 There is no better measure than the one used.Everything else can may skyrocket in price but basic commodities such as the ones pictured should be available to all and sundry  at a reasonable price
121 2018-11-10 13:17:48 In case you thought traditional commodities and blockchain wasn't speculative enough.
122 2018-11-10 13:16:38 ¿Qué dijo Bolsonaro en esa explicación al pueblo? Que Brasil precisa exportar más productos industriales y no tanto commodities que “en algún momento, como es el caso de los minerales, se acaban”." Y NOSOTROS SOPA, PERDON SOJA" condenados al exitoooo.
123 2018-11-10 13:06:23 Quite indeed. I have no problem with FIAT as a comparison but I hear your idea for a top 20 coin average. I think maybe a top 20 currency/stock/metals/commodities average, compare to the whole investment world for a more comprehensive value. Just using crypto is still arbitrary.
124 2018-11-10 12:59:14 Clear evidence of the true evil of privatisation of services caring for the most vulnerable in society. People have become commodities to be traded for profit. Caring for them has become secondary. A 21stC obscenity.

 Please advise KPCC leaders to propagate against the soaring prices of essential commodities, petrol and diesel and against NDA instead of wasting time and energy for Sabarimala issues joining hands with the state NDA fraction.
126 2018-11-10 12:33:55 You're not being fair, you're being extremely lenient. Marx goes on and on about usefulness and commodities being use values in the first paragraphs of the actual text. There is no fucking way a sincere, open reading of the text produces the result in the OP.
127 2018-11-10 12:32:51 Wo chattisgadh wo ya others states in india all common ppl now realized where we r struggling with common needs like gas,petrol hikes no employement no development u know sir aaj kal without 200₹ daily karcha for basic needs for food imagine how hikes all commodities? @ncbn
128 2018-11-10 12:25:07 Mas qual a proporção de commodities no total de exportações? Qual efeito de 14,25% numa inflação de custos, já que vc mesmo lembrou dos “tarifaços” de 2015?
129 2018-11-10 12:23:58 So basically this is another loan to import fuel and other commodities,and not to capacitate any production?
130 2018-11-10 12:17:37 This is a question which could only be asked by someone who has not read _The Great Transformation_ by Karl Polanyi.

tl;dr, humans are not commodities; they are not produced to be sold in a market.
131 2018-11-10 12:16:23 Failed commodities broker gives advice on comodites. Greaaat.
132 2018-11-10 12:14:15 I don’t understand it. And also marketing them as solo artists when they are not properly established as a group. BTS performed for two and a half hours with material mainly from this year. YG is treating them as commodities rather than investments.
133 2018-11-10 12:01:12 Saying things like this reduce women to commodities that men must pay for. And you know the implications in this 21st century
134 2018-11-10 11:57:17 Mentira! O Lula apenas surfou a onda deixada por FHC e a valorização das commodities. Ao invés de fazer as reformas que o país precisava investiu apenas em@políticas populistas.
135 2018-11-10 11:49:51 Absolutely. The Southern chain gangs after the Civil War; now private for-profit prisons. People were/are just disposable commodities.
136 2018-11-10 11:35:54 Narizinho, porque você só fala em Lula, que surfou no crescimento mundial, no recorde de valorização das Commodities, na inflação controlada por FHC, qualquer vigarista teria sucesso naquela situação. Vamos falar da Dilma !!! Quanto empregos era tirou dos brasileiros ???

1/ Lets be frank...2018 has been one to forget for commodity bulls - see chart below for YTD performance comparison. 
Surprisingly - which two commodities outperformed (& only 2 with +ve returns)? #Uranium and #NatGas (HH). 
Worst = base metals #zinc, #copper
150 2018-11-10 10:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
151 2018-11-10 10:00:32 Doesn't the Governor know that bond notes and USD are now commodities being sold everyday in this country. Where is the monitoring role of the RBZ and banks on individual accounts?
152 2018-11-10 09:52:26 I live this article although many will not understand it. I see the corporate world going in the opposite direction. Labor and work are considered as commodities; they are paid for their work and therefore are duly compensated. Instead companies reward and promote position (more)
153 2018-11-10 09:42:10 ELECTION HEAT! We are Heading towards the Polls on the issues of    Demonetisation,GST,Rise in Prices of Fuel and Essential Commodities,UnEmployment and Rafael Issue. The issues are also responsible for opposition parties joining hands seem natural.
154 2018-11-10 09:27:37 6) Uma boa parte do mercado esperava um "Bolsorally" pós eleições. O mês de Outubro foi marcado por compra massiva de Institucional Local na Bovespa (gringo só vendeu). Como isso não está ocorrendo, buscam-se culpas externas: commodities, China, Irã, Arábia, etc...
155 2018-11-10 09:24:17 Hengli Group Co. signed deals at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai to import $11 billion worth of commodities and equipment, including a $3.6 billion crude-oil agreement with Saudi Aramco, it said in a statement
156 2018-11-10 09:21:48 'Trading Places' tops my list. Not only the best film about commodities trading ever made, it happens to be one of the best films to watch during the holidays. In fact, the movie covers Thanksgiving, Xmas and New Years; a cinematic trifecta!  Bonus: ends up on vacay. 
157 2018-11-10 09:20:57 The Antipodeans are commodity currencies like the loonie but the Kiwi is more soft commodities and is used more speculatively as a carry or risk on/ risk off play
158 2018-11-10 09:06:19 Commodities are the opium of the people.
159 2018-11-10 09:01:20 Its the only way through which we can sustainably produce healthy and nutritious foods!

160 2018-11-10 08:25:26 We see kids in rural communities help their parents in the farm. The margins realised from the farm work is pretty small. China is our creditor cause of the high margins derived from manufacturing the world’s commodities.

Parents should encourage kids to read books. #Knowledge
161 2018-11-10 08:09:14 Struggling commodity prices signal more trouble could be ahead for the stock market Stocks have bounced back nicely since entering a correction in October. But several commodities have failed to recover along with them, suggesting more trouble may lie ahead for investors. …
162 2018-11-10 08:00:38 NB: dangote thru bankers and nupeng to fud Supply middle men are d problem.
These can be replicated in major socio Political commodities i.e petrol, kerosene,healthcare,milk,fish and low cost housing(if I may add).
They shld never be left in d hands of demand/supply!

165 2018-11-10 07:49:53 Also Its governments fault that it wont let any other agri commodities prices under the pretense of reducing inflation. Why should farmers keep on feeding urban population when government wont let prices rise?
166 2018-11-10 07:10:40 prioritising vehicles amidst the sky rocketin prices on basic commodities, what a shame. Ordinary citizens are suffering at the expense of mps
167 2018-11-10 07:08:57 So do all other commodities? What can be done now? Do u thing you r d only one know this n concerned? All 125 crores Indians know this but understand reasons for this situation, accept n pay n live happily! Now can u tell solution? Ppl will like to hear or read that first!
168 2018-11-10 07:03:53 Strip away all that commodities stuff and we are still, fundamentally, a lucky country. For now.

171 2018-11-10 06:11:42 1) almost no increase in import bill is huge success bcz there was continuous high increase for almost a decade. 2) may be high oil prices offsets decrease in import bill of non oil commodities. 
3) the depreciation of Ruppe after end PMLN govt will have effect in coming months
172 2018-11-10 06:11:06 Your missing commodities on that chart.
173 2018-11-10 05:58:22 Even the price of basic commodities never remain same for 4/5yrs but this soldier turned self-proclaimed defence expert talking about #Rafale price with some unverified data.

There should be limit of moronism.....
174 2018-11-10 05:58:02 Así es arroz y maíz son commodities, los gobiernos no saben administrarlos; nos usan a los agricultores dependiendo del momento político. En maíz el fomentador se lleva la ganancia. En arroz el pilador. Maíz y arroz se deben vender con valor agregado. Maíz molido y arroz pilado.
175 2018-11-10 05:05:03 3253: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
176 2018-11-10 04:49:13 Comparing to dollar. US is China's biggest export market and China buys many of its commodities by paying with US dollars, though they are trying to change this. Thanks for weighing in on my comments, your perspective is useful to read.
177 2018-11-10 04:46:01 Karena komoditas di pasar listrik itu bukan cuma energi listrik, tapi banyak "supporting commodities" -nya. Memang harga energi listrik dari angin dan surya murah, tapi dia butuh banyak "supporting commodities" tersebut sehingga ujung-ujungnya jadi lebih mahal.

179 2018-11-10 04:36:33 Yesterday, as I took a 1 hour Uber ride the driver a young man who is also a commodity and equity sub-broker  Listened to his story of struggles and how he trades in commodities was a learning and time well spent 
180 2018-11-10 04:32:12 We should be able to assess and critique industries without making it personal. It’s true that farmers are generally decent, hard working people. It’s also true that when animals are used as commodities in the food industry, bad things result.
181 2018-11-10 04:22:42 There is even interesting research that I got to work on briefly where the waste commodities (glycerol) during the palm oil esterification process can be further converted to new fuels sources to get the maximum out of resources!
182 2018-11-10 04:09:20 Aren't most of the commodities above 80th percentile still?! Like it or not we had choices this drought. Decisions to feed or not are made a lot easier with a few figures & current forward contracts as guide. Hedge relative to individual risk appetite/finances & backup plan
183 2018-11-10 03:49:40 whatever happened but commodities/Veggies/Fruit prices remained in control throughout 4.5 years.
184 2018-11-10 03:42:47 There is a difference between inflation of commodities and inflation in currency.
185 2018-11-10 03:41:59 There is a difference between inflation of commodities and inflation in currency. From which school u have studied Economics?
186 2018-11-10 03:33:18 The best response on this thread.”Rich is relative “.
It amazes me when people come up with the lame analysis about prices of commodities 4 years ago compared to recent times forgetting prices can never remain the same because of variable indicators.
187 2018-11-10 03:27:09 Some people are.kore concerned than others.

All commodities are currencies.
And all currencies are commodities.

The Fed and US GOVT, try to manipulate the US$. Mostly they get what they want.

Don't like it, use Apple or Amazon shares.

190 2018-11-10 03:01:48 Desde hace muchos años economistas de todas las escuelas y tendencias dicen lo mismo: si no diversificamos nuestras exportaciones TODA LA VIDA vamos a depender de los vaivenes de las materias primas o commodities, pero sucesivos gobiernos han hecho poco o nada al respecto...
191 2018-11-10 02:52:32 Pasó antes, durante consolidación de mediados del siglo XIX, pasó a mediados del siglo XX, en auge de commodities por la II Guerra Mundial y pasa ahora, con Odebrecht; al final, el objetivo es el mismo; ganar plata sea como sea, el capitalismo salvaje en su mas pura expresión...
192 2018-11-10 02:48:06 Penso no respeito à soberania dos povos. Essa é a prática adotada por nossa diplomacia.

193 2018-11-10 02:46:59 Mainly commodities.
194 2018-11-10 02:46:50 FUD, Fear Uncertainty & Doubt. Cada activo financiero, sea monedas, commodities u acciones reciben cientos de rumores, los que estan en corto quieren bajar el valor, el factor confianza es el que los mantiene (medianamente) estables.
195 2018-11-10 02:34:54 I don’t know, for any given good I can think of I wouldn’t generally describe it as being in a state of severe glut, nor plagued by chronic shortages, except for maybe some of the most basic commodities, or housing.
196 2018-11-10 02:30:59 Music can absolutely be sold without other commodities. Look at Gaga. She stopped selling perfumes and other stupid shit. Its just her art and her tours. Even if it was jist her art, she would be successful.

200 2018-11-10 02:07:44 He read it properly. No price rise in essential commodities vegetables like onion, potato , fertilizer,LPG . thanks to Modi Government.
201 2018-11-10 01:53:58 Why we ran to Japan instead of China as 2nd biggest econ? Why we refused to honor the agreement with investors ECRL&HSR&pipeline? And why FFS we want 3rd car project? Commodities price falling bcause China refused to buy from us. This is about our econ policy and direction.

230 2018-11-11 20:52:44 China and their cheap labor and commodities have been a huge part of it. Cheap Chinese steel is a perfect example of why inflation has been tame. Trump's tariffs could make steel production profitable again for the US, but it also creates inflation and rising prices.

240 2018-11-11 22:14:34 The banker who trades in commodities is a murderer.
241 2018-11-11 22:06:51 I feel like many of our people need to be enlightened about what it is to be human. The way #Yoruba #AfMagic portrays women as dispensable AND commodities is alarming. #Kogbodosele is cringeworthy and disgusting.

244 2018-11-11 21:12:36 Quite right. There’s v little indeed on hedging in crypto. Will check with commodities...excellent idea, thanks 
245 2018-11-11 21:11:36 “Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by "opinions" when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking.” - Napoleon Hill
246 2018-11-11 21:02:25 Pilgrims don’t go round waging wars and capturing the native people and use them as slaves. Pilgrims trade and share what knowledge they have for knowledge or commodities in return pilgrims want to see their mission as a success not a war won
247 2018-11-11 20:52:44 China and their cheap labor and commodities have been a huge part of it. Cheap Chinese steel is a perfect example of why inflation has been tame. Trump's tariffs could make steel production profitable again for the US, but it also creates inflation and rising prices.
248 2018-11-11 20:48:15 We hv a shortage of basic commodities in our country, so in order to import goods we need foreign currency, of which the banks must provide bt they cant. Threfore we hv to search fo it at the black market since bond redu richingoshanda munomu chete..chingogarai masunga nyika yese
249 2018-11-11 20:46:19 commodities.... lower as capex pumper more. things technology could not affect went up. i.e. realestate.
250 2018-11-11 20:45:21 Is this the bit at the end of commodities?
251 2018-11-11 20:42:30 You forgot to add what the price of these commodities were before PDP took over Nigeria. Yes our debt has also gone up but PDP have their share in the N13 trillion.....but our national reserves that was badly depleted under PDP have gone up by almost 100%.
252 2018-11-11 20:39:28 Subtlety and ambiguity can be wonderful, but I they tend to be overrated commodities. Sometimes clear, direct communication with clear intent is exactly what is needed.
253 2018-11-11 20:37:44 this country wants to charge for education--its already highly elitist. You think cause you can power computers developing nations will suddenly get other free "commodities"? nearsighted stupid bastards.

255 2018-11-11 20:26:44 It's a difficult situation for us Zimbabweans right now. prices of basic commodities increasing everyday & elnino threats. food & nutrition insecurity is becoming a reality everyday.
256 2018-11-11 20:19:03 1) La evasión no se combate con impuestos, sino formalizando la economía 2) me refiero a los grandes productores que exportan commodities sin industrializar. Venden a precio dolar, usan la tierra y dejan muy poco en impuestos a cambio. Tan difícil es entender eso?
257 2018-11-11 20:14:59 If China doesn't price commodities in CNY, they'll go way of USSR.  If Russia does it & Saudi doesn't, Saudi will lose mkt share in biggest/only oil growth market in world (China) - this has happened to date.  If Saudi goes ahead w/pricing oil in CNY, everyone else will have to.
258 2018-11-11 20:10:35 Ajá pero el déficit lo superábamos dejando los commodities y dedicándonos a vender aguacates...
259 2018-11-11 20:00:15 It's also definitely more of the "known" commodities in the space, so it could also be shelter. I dunno, chart looks pretty good though. Just some things to consider.
260 2018-11-11 19:51:39 CASH RULES EVERYTHING AROUND ME

It also rules everything around you, too. So long as we adhere to the belief that the concept of cash is an expression of value for basic commodities, we will continue to be ruled by cash. We must break free from this prison of our own making.

I feel safer when I put my wealth on a #Blockchain instead of a bank account.

It doesn't matter if you invest in real-estate, commodities, or stocks, and etc.; same risks & principles apply.

It's a matter of trust I guess.

Nature gave us plenty; sub, wind, water.

We just need to learn to harness them properly.

263 2018-11-11 19:43:24 used to emphasize the amount or degree to which something is affected.
    "commodities made all the more desirable by their rarity"
264 2018-11-11 19:39:34 Cut drugs out of your life and you will no longer feel neurological attached to capitalist commodities.
265 2018-11-11 19:38:03 A mi no me sorprendio mucho esta inclusion creo q comparten el outlook en commodities, pero si q tengan solo 4 gestoras. De esas solo conozco a G&R, las otras tendre q echarles un vistazo
266 2018-11-11 19:32:23 Ballots are treated like commodities, a certain amount of waste is acceptable. They are not commodities. Each ballot has equal and intrinsic value. All must be counted, especially in a close race, to accurately gauge the desires of the people.
267 2018-11-11 19:31:18 Crearon en sus países modelos de crecimiento basado en commodities sin innovación ni productividad. Los 3 países son dependientes absolutos de los precios de hidrocarburos y materias primas, un concepto de hace 70 años, ni cerca de casos de éxito como Singapur y Corea del Sur.

269 2018-11-11 19:17:57 I gotta learn more about buying and selling raw commodities..
270 2018-11-11 19:14:10 If the Asian culture  were to suffer the alarming  arrest rate Blacks did, there would  be no one left to sell as sex slaves, and human trafficking. Coincidentally,  the people that buy them as commodities  are not Black. JS
271 2018-11-11 19:06:49 Thanks for proving my point. How do indigenous people whose land is stolen for cattle grazing in the Amazon benefit from the beef trade? How does the planet benefit when biodiversity is destroyed for the monoculture to make cheap commodities?
272 2018-11-11 19:03:40 Oga try invite us o...We no leave Africa and my company deals in commodities for export so the connect will be good
273 2018-11-11 19:02:17 They run deficits on tourism & commodities.  If they can print CNY for commodities by offering gold settlement (which they are doing) then they can use UK/US gold to prevent a Chinese Balance of Payments problem bc ex-commodities they have an estimated $700B goods trade surplus.
274 2018-11-11 18:39:46 1) Nationalism, Chauvinism & Fascism are three different terms.

276 2018-11-11 18:27:50 mais a Petrobras tinha que fabricar esses commodities para baixar cada vez mais o valor,já que teremos um presidente que irá lutar para retirar essa enorme carga tributária sobre nossos costas!!!
277 2018-11-11 18:18:00 His wife is one of those persons who really feels there is something rather sinful about these commodities, so she nagged, and her intolerance finally threw him into a fit of anger. p.135 #BigBook #AA #XA
278 2018-11-11 18:08:09 So it's your argument that lashing ourselves more tightly to volatile global commodities via export somehow makes us more dependent than producing and using more homegrown energy right here? Interesting.
279 2018-11-11 17:51:37 You write yourself - people investing in bitcoin speculate on profits. Gambling! Not used as a medium of exchange ! Don’t compare a currency to stocks and bonds or commodities - different assets !
280 2018-11-11 17:49:21 '@CroftHelima, the chief commodities strategist at Canada's RBC, said Venezuela would be unlikely to boost output even with an emergency cash injection. Many oil staff are leaving their position or "going hungry. The infrastructure is in complete disrepair' - WSJ. #OOTT
281 2018-11-11 17:34:29 Kkkkkkkkk... Quem não viu foi vc. Se tivesse visto, saberia que os gastos de governo, foram maiores que a  prosperidade alcançada pela demanda de commodities brasileiras, principalmente o petróleo.
282 2018-11-11 17:25:10 O PT não tirou de cima, tirou da classe média e, se aproveitou enquanto dava certo, da alta dos preços das commodities. Nunca bancos lucraram tanto, nunca empresas privadas de ensino superior lucraram tanto, nunca a concentração de renda dos superbilionarios cresceu tanto, etc.

285 2018-11-11 17:15:38 You’re not. I’ve seen it happening for years with women who are hot commodities in smaller cities then move to a bigger one and see how low on the totem pole they really are.

Winning - confident among ppl where BJP is ruling, better governance, good work by Modi / Shah and few leaders, commodities price under control, youth votes..
288 2018-11-11 16:56:43 All part of the hideous narrative that sees #disabled #Autistic and #mentallyill  people as 'cash cows'.  Commodities to be traded.
289 2018-11-11 16:55:33 Sadly neither Peace nor Liberty should ever be taken for granted, as they are precious commodities we have to continully fight to defend and uphold (not always militarily).
290 2018-11-11 16:51:51 Bonsoir à tous. Voici les analyses "commodities" faisant suite à celles Forex et Indices envoyées par mail aux abonnés.
291 2018-11-11 16:47:13 Also, GST has ensured less tax computation than earlier system and its easy for business houses to file. And, some commodities were exorbitantly priced in different states due to different tax slabs. Now there is an uniformity which is good for the consumer as well.
292 2018-11-11 16:41:28 There is a fine line between "being united in one country" and economic integration. No country in the horn is self-sufficient. No state has the capacity to produce all the required agricultural commodities
293 2018-11-11 16:10:03 Our time and attention are commodities in the social media economy without which they cannot survive.The thought process that went into building these applications was all about ‘How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible? #bewareOfSocialMedia
294 2018-11-11 16:00:04 Idea 649:Interoperable e-consumer commodities controlling micromachined web infrastructures to assess shortcomings of social housing
295 2018-11-11 15:57:40 There's no such thing as humane slaughter! As long as animals are seen as commodities instead of as individuals, abuse is inevitable.
296 2018-11-11 15:56:13 No comprende senor. Does de-dollarizing lead to commodities denominated in $ going higher? Govies sell off? Yields jump. Bonds provide alternative to stocks?  Perfect conditions to start a war and revive flagging polls?  Is that what you foresee?
297 2018-11-11 15:48:55 All valuable commodities
298 2018-11-11 15:38:07 Trump demeans everything he touches! When you have no morals or ideals even America’s highest honors are just commodities to exploit for your own self interest. #TrumpMostCorruptPOTUSofalltime
299 2018-11-11 15:36:58 1)  Certainly anything is possible & many smart ppl agree w you. To your point though, before this one, the longest bull market was from 1990-2000. Stocks were high, unemployment was low and #commodities were trash... just like now. Unemployment didn't warn then either.
300 2018-11-11 15:32:27 My dear Barr Keyamo,wat happened in Osun has made me to know that massive constructn of roads & bridges plays little role in determining who/what party people vote for but their welfare and ability to buy necessary commodities like foodstuffs & the likes at affordable prices do.
301 2018-11-11 15:31:02 I don't disagree but there are other factors at work than "just" consumer logic. This is a very American situation; I don't think it could happen anywhere else (for now at least) From a foreign point of view, America is the land where babies have been commodities for a long time.
302 2018-11-11 15:30:56 I served my country because the Bill of Rights should be defended and supported. A document declaring that we will not be subjugated or treated as commodities.

If you want to thank me for my service, just be decent to one another.

303 2018-11-11 15:28:37 But they say nothing good comes free... I am just thinking Eternal life might not be free o, the remaining free commodities I don't know
304 2018-11-11 15:24:19 Taxes high, corruption up 240%, public debt toppled 5trillion, unemployment over 50%, basic prices goods n commodities more than doubled.....yes we certified with this incompetence....
305 2018-11-11 15:23:32 Keep (WTI/Brent) Crude prices on the radar (Commodities -to- Equities correlation)
306 2018-11-11 15:14:26 Yes but I don’t see commodities countdown on YouTube
307 2018-11-11 15:13:47 Zambian retailers though, maybe I'm failing to comprehend a bigger picture but I honestly feel the reason you are there is purely sales, whatever commodities you have, you want/have to sell, and every single sale counts, you're not in wholesale therefore each individual sale is
308 2018-11-11 14:51:30 Thats not what Trump said. When he talks about America 1st, is for the RECOVERY of Economics & Commodities in America. When the left had office they distorted the Minds of the naïve people in the America. Nationalism is the      Epitome of patriotism.
309 2018-11-11 14:38:53 You assume bcos we import many more goods than what we export, we shd be spending more on imports than exports. That assumption is flawed. The total VALUE (price × quantity) of the commodities Gh exported in 2017 was more than the total VALUE(price×quantity) of imports.
310 2018-11-11 14:37:19 Miguel D. Lewis - Capitalism is religion.  Banks are churches.  Bankers are priests.  Wealth is heaven.  Poverty is hell.  Rich people are saints.  Poor people are sinners.  Commodities are blessings.  Money is God.
311 2018-11-11 14:27:31 En tiempos de guerra y crisis económica los gobiernos imprimen más y más dinero para cubrir sus deficit y gastos bélicos.
El oro y otros commodities han sido refugio, pero esta sería la primera vez donde se contará con las criptomonedas y será muy interesante ver que sucede.
312 2018-11-11 14:27:14 One of the consequences of the current media debate on prisons should\would probably be:

Citizens rushing there with gifts (food, clothes, soap ...) for "some" prisoners.

Believe me, "some" of these prisoners really need basic commodities.
313 2018-11-11 14:16:12 The other 67% went out of business as the War on commodities continues.
314 2018-11-11 14:07:34 Somalis have ports and lack ships and traffic to feed them, Ethios have agricultural commodities and ships but not port to dock them. 
Total together would have $250 billion PPP GDP, between Finland and Hungary.
315 2018-11-11 14:05:14 Ore, subsidy or not.. We now know what it will cost us to bring in fuel, we are no longer paying for unseen commodities, and if it will cost the govt additional funds to bring in this product without any pain to Nigerians; I don't mind.
Let the NNPC sha be accountable.
316 2018-11-11 13:52:47 Pegue de 2003 até 2014 e veja o histórico do PT. A crise começa mesmo no segundo mandato da Dilma, quando o boicote do Congresso se junta à crise dos preços das commodities. E depois da saída da Dilma não melhorou muito, né?
317 2018-11-11 13:50:21 7. Hauling bulk commodities.           8. Carwash o/o.                                      9. Farmer all the jobs list above were done while I worked on our own farm.
318 2018-11-11 13:42:58 A autoria desta proeza chama-se ciclo de commodities atípico.
319 2018-11-11 13:21:20 Interesting article, but when a administration wrecks existing markets and trade alliances, how are producers of bulk commodities like corn and soybeans supposed to a global supplier?
320 2018-11-11 13:13:09 People who try to emphasize that goods/services aren’t human rights really think they’ve done something. When the argument is that essential commodities should be seen as public goods and made easily accessible.
321 2018-11-11 13:07:08 AMO o mito que o brasileiro tem que a exportação de commodities irá fazer o país tornar-se uma nação desenvolvida.
322 2018-11-11 13:02:18 Vocês não entendem PORRA NENHUMA de mineração, siderurgia, ligas metálicas e precificação de commodities. Parem de falar MERDA sobre o Nb. Nióbio tem substituto. Se o preço aumentar a demanda cai.

325 2018-11-11 12:39:33 possibly?? Pff, animals are commodities for these poeple..thing to make money with instead of living breathing beings
326 2018-11-11 12:22:25 Less than 590k tons of commodities now needed to fully repair Liman Legacy. In the last few days an astronomical amount of goods have been hauled by IDA despite the strife & uncertainty as @TheThargoids ratchet up their attacks within the bubble. Amazing work CMDRs! o7
327 2018-11-11 12:11:10 You removed the import ban to enable us to buy commodities from outside, banks are not dishing out foreign currency to anyone...buying forex yacho mustreet wonzi ten years...ndiri kutadza kubata maths yacho @edmnangagwa. Help me out
328 2018-11-11 11:59:38 When did crude price start determining the price of locally made goods like garri and since the crude price appreciated why haven't we seen any change or fall in the prices of commodities?  Na only gullible minds una fit deceive again #neveragain
329 2018-11-11 11:30:42 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.
330 2018-11-11 11:15:22 Unfortunately, veterans have always been treated with disregard. They are treated as commodities and no amount of whining about illegal 'aliens' will change that.
331 2018-11-11 10:47:08 Understand why fuel prices vary, calculate how much you save if it increases by few rupees. Compare with how you are saving on other things like mobile bills, essential commodities after gst compared to 2013-14.dont blindly follow your stupid boss.
332 2018-11-11 10:43:22 I’m also very bullish on commodities (Uranium in particular).
333 2018-11-11 10:43:06 Possibly, we do have a vote & can rid ourselves of them. But what of the damage done by the EU? The dumping of commodities on world markets? The various scandals swept under the carpet, a  loaded subsidy system which favours wealth & drives land out of reach of the many. etc.
334 2018-11-11 10:38:32 Even I had not thot of it that way. At the end of day whatever the facts or fiction of this matter, the reality of runaway prices of basic commodities remains as true as the needle is to the North.
335 2018-11-11 10:24:53 What my mom understands is her commodities been bought on the market cos people have money in their pockets and not the big English been read at parliament and she asking me to explain
336 2018-11-11 09:44:50 For as long as non-human animals are considered commodities, the almighty $ will win out and their welfare & the environment will never be prioritized. 
I do think it would help if people had to pay the real price of animal products - because they'd be bought less.
337 2018-11-11 09:44:42 When you vote, you have the power to make a choice to elect a right candidate, who promises to provide gud health system,economical education, employment, control prices of essential commodities, fuel price, development of infrastructure @nistula @rohini_sgh @RifatJawaid @neo_pac
338 2018-11-11 09:40:25 Finally, expensive easy to lose glasses that make you look like the chief accountant of a disgraced commodities speculator
339 2018-11-11 09:39:23 The taxpayers pay for these troops, unfortunately, those troops become commodities to the agencies, contractors and services required for the task at hand...

All very profitable... and if you dig deeper, ends up full circle in some form or capacity to the decision makers.
340 2018-11-11 09:36:18 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
341 2018-11-11 09:30:02 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
342 2018-11-11 09:22:18 "Primeiro, o ambiente global deteriorou-se acentuadamente, com a queda dos preços das exportações de commodities ainda crucial para a economia brasileira".
343 2018-11-11 09:19:26 You can try to bang the door of a commodities trader, but it just might bang the door of you instead.
344 2018-11-11 09:18:32 Nothing wrong with the analysis, but I find the definition of the pyramid scheme lacking, currently the stock market and fx and commodities also look like pyramid schemes by that definition

346 2018-11-11 09:04:37 Thank you for sticking with appalling story. We know too, too many who are being traded as commodities for the fat cats. It is cruel and surely against human rights because the care sure ain't good. In fact in many cases it is inhuman.
347 2018-11-11 08:47:33 what's expections from PM to reduce prices of commodities on the stake of vote what earlier gov was doing. Are we confused? How only income grow but not d expense.

Who we want to see as a PM
Rahul? Akhilesh? Mayawati? Mamta? Who???
348 2018-11-11 08:43:52 same here in FL, the area hurricane Michael destroyed, totally unbound to reality. Unfortunately, most of them will have to experience extreme personal loss before realizing they're just #'s, commodities being conned by RW, GOP to keep them in power while they rob them blind
349 2018-11-11 08:33:28 Sir what is your personal opinion but somehow government has managed the price rise on critical commodities like Rice and Dhaal how ?
350 2018-11-11 08:33:18 And, add to this the huge profits being made by private sector fat cats at the expense of those with learning disabilities/autism and the vulnerable become commodities to be bartered. Where is the noise about this appalling abuse of care ?
351 2018-11-11 08:18:36 US auto giant General Motors upped the average price of its SUVs, crossovers and pickups by $800, something the company ties to rising costs for steel and aluminum -- commodities on which President Donald Trump slapped steep new import duties this year.
352 2018-11-11 08:01:06 More borrowings for commodities. Why aren’t we borrowing to fund economic activity that generates more than we borrow? When will we start to live within our means as Zimbabwe!?
353 2018-11-11 07:52:16 And there is also the need of everything to have capital value in the ultra utilitarian system we live in. We need to evaluate the way we see resources and the value we assign to commodities if we want to survive.

Our planet is choking to death from pollution caused by consumtion of totally useless commodities. Some of irelands rubbish ends up in places like india where children forage in toxic waste for stuff that we throw away to make a few pennies. Lets be honest here.

356 2018-11-11 07:31:02 Absolutely and I hope people will read behind the headlines, deforestation isn’t just a palm oil issue it’s connected with a range of agricultural commodities and land tenure issues.
357 2018-11-11 07:28:22 Good work - have to give kudos to this church. You’ll probably get people committing crime to get in now coz of the clean water and food. Not an easy pair of commodities to obtain even if you’re outside prison #zim
358 2018-11-11 07:19:59 It's why so much of this long story begins (and ends) with entertainers and other high profile People Commodities.
359 2018-11-11 07:04:12 It's simple, the BIG thieves consumption pattern do not really change & if it does, it is of inelastic commodities. Over 30k MW will increase ppl's consumption & with the current productive capacity & output of the economy, plenty money will start to chase few goods...

Yet war and bombs are simple commodities to likes of @realDonaldTrump and Saudi Arabia regime that  life is cheap!
Pun not intended!
Why is the human race losing in a one horse race?
367 2018-11-11 06:15:36 Conversion fees, 25 to 40% of Rs 2laks. Commodities like Coffee, Tea,Rice were also purchased from farmers 4 cash, who deposited into banks these old black notes.
368 2018-11-11 06:10:55 some retail prices makes me wonder , do they want to sell or not , those commodities are supposed to be consumed not to display

370 2018-11-11 06:02:14 A few controversial stupid motormouths in the party that media will gladly publicise. Right now changing the names of cities is being publicised.

Inflation being reduced to less than 4%. Cost of essential commodities.

373 2018-11-11 05:36:01 I studied programming my whole life and got a union job in a warehouse and love it. Automation will cause a crisis of employment and when we dont have money they economy will come to screeching halt. It's good to be optimistic but realistic also, were human beings not commodities

375 2018-11-11 04:25:59 There was a increase in suicide during financial disaster 2008 so on .. People will just kill them selves if they can't get all of my commodities out from under everyone at bank . Imagine how depressed the diamond mine thief was when California had to get bailout from Obama
376 2018-11-11 04:24:45 Thanks! It’s a part of the job. We understand that fans are passionate about their teams.  Fans have to understand that teams treat players as commodities. There’s always another guy. So it’s important for players to make sure they take care of themselves through the process.

381 2018-11-11 03:43:32 Empower yourself by fighting your addiction to the capitalist commodities known as drugs.
382 2018-11-11 02:46:36 1.) Somewhat agree. I get the expense of putting a show on Bway & why investors pick shows sourced from already-known commodities. But when what results is clearly just a money grab (“let’s put the ape onstage, who cares about making a good show?”), it’s an insult to audiences
383 2018-11-11 02:35:30 And a slave labor pool to make worthless commodities that waste all kinds of resources and accelerate climate change
384 2018-11-11 02:34:48 If it sells for $5K then that’s what it’s worth. But even countries that arr wealthy because of a concentration of commodities don’t change the statistical that middle classes are produced from countries that become wealthy. Qatar is actually wealthiest per capital PPP country...
385 2018-11-11 02:05:05 @TheGreenMonkeyM What a terrible place to work, stop exploiting teachers and treating them as disposable commodities and exploiting students just to get their money. Do not work or study with this so called company.

387 2018-11-11 01:47:56 I have always been fascinated by this narrative. Aurat = maruah makanya maruah lelaki lebih murah berbanding perempuan? You have just insulted your own gender man.

Also we're humans not commodities. Can we put this mahal murah narrative to rest already?
388 2018-11-11 01:40:41 We treat them like commodities because our consciousness is sleeping We differentiate between our pain and their sufferings.Elder sister instead of behaving like a guardian is busy in eating younger one in a mindless manner
389 2018-11-11 01:25:58 Thanks - lots of uncertainty of market timing, not uncertain at all of direction for most commodities. If this house sells while I’m waiting for the market to work it’s magic that’s ok, another house will come along. : )

391 2018-11-11 01:20:50 Cara, tivemos uma crise das commodities em 2014 e em 2016 o afastamento da Dilma. No ano de 2013 o desemprego estava em 4 milhões. Em 2016 com a crise política em 13 milhões.
392 2018-11-11 01:10:45 Causes of child marriages

396 2018-11-11 00:32:31 If China prices commodities in CNY, Fed will have to monetize US deficits.  If US goes to war w China, Fed will have to monetize deficits.  Up til either outcome, USD should be firm...
397 2018-11-11 00:30:57 It is a matter of Chinese national security to price commodities in CNY; if they do, their BoP problems disappear (IIF: non-commodity trade surplus = $700B), while US BoP problems become immediate = so it is a matter of US nat sec that China does not price commodities in CNY.
398 2018-11-11 00:26:27 What was interesting (I guess) is many E&P's didn't make any money when oil went up and then lost an additional 30% on the way down. The war against commodities continues. HFT is the Fed/Treasury's new tool to fight inflation (and collusion).
399 2018-11-11 00:25:44 What do you make of the trend? Seems there is 1 of 3 options:
1) Commodities keep rising, equities continue lagging
2) Equities play big time catch-up to commods 
3) The two meet somewhere in the middle
400 2018-11-11 00:11:21 That’s exactly the low standards of fanatics. It doesn’t matter if Du30 is an incompetent fool for as long as he keeps his popularity. If popularity can only solve problems. Kaso mo hindi! So enjoy high prices of gas/commodities, the killings, corruption, stupidity & incompetence

464 2018-11-09 20:01:05 instantly reminded of this paper where the author was trying to argue that marx's concept of use value anticipated marginal utility & his point about the use value of MoP wearing out & transferring to commodities was actually marginal utility transferring from MoP to product
465 2018-11-09 19:57:13 i totally agree! that’s why these journalists need to know the full extent of our disgust. they all think city fans are fair game. that we have no commercial clout of any interest to the commodities they represent. they could not be more mistaken
466 2018-11-09 19:56:29 in case you're wondering how: not buying a VR headset and borrowing it from some other poor bastard is like tax cuts for the rich but tax raises on working class commodities like soda, plastic bags, straws

469 2018-11-09 19:48:09 Aggrieved ? In what sense ? Why did Phillip Commodities stop trading in prop account before crisis and was busy luring the Traders trip abroad for trading at NSEL ? What was the incentive ? Why were the Traders misrepresented by you ?
470 2018-11-09 19:47:04 Thanks for your reply. I have been an individual trader since 2008 and have followed you for over a decade. May I ask if you trade commodities and if not why? For me, the technical action has a much more 'human" feel.

477 2018-11-09 19:24:38 As a futures trader I switched to commodities several years ago. I wonder why more people don't do the same. The markets are much more rational. Why would a trader pick the stock market over the commodity market?
478 2018-11-09 19:18:19 No because some commodities are given more priorities than others irrespective of there cost of production....its sarcastic to learn that the price of:
Mineral water  500ml =30/= .
Milk    1litre                   30/=.
Egg                                 20/=.

While MAIZE =20/=

482 2018-11-09 18:37:20 the rails own the right of way... but did you know some of the commodities they transport can kill life within a half mile radius or greater? they should pay a usage tax based on the OVER INFLATED car load data they share with the public to increase share prices...
483 2018-11-09 18:35:40 Também acho que não se deve romper relações com os árabes por isso, mas precisamos parar de contentar-nos com apenas exportar commodities, desenvolvendo exportações de maior valor agregado. E não aceitar ser meros reféns de quem compra essas commodities. Soberania também é bom!

498 2018-11-09 17:34:44 Boy.. #commodities are taking a beating!!
499 2018-11-09 17:16:05 Thanks. I was beginning to wondering if anyone was watching this. Apparently in addition to using commodities for production, China has been using them (copper. gold. iron...) as collateral for credit. It helps explain why commodities have risen so high and then fallen to far.
500 2018-11-09 17:11:01 I'm not a big fan of trying to pick bottoms. However, most commodities are incredibly cheap compared to the cycle peak in 2011. Most likely, commodities are headed much higher as a new cyclical bull market begins in 2019 or 2020. Thanks!
501 2018-11-09 17:05:19 Would this be a good time to invest in commodities since they are on the low??
502 2018-11-09 16:55:55 babys: r/PUBG mods r jerks

90skid: that’s cute. i’m branching into commodities and crypto to further diversify my portfolio ahead of the forthcoming economic meltown in 2Q19.
503 2018-11-09 16:54:32 We don’t adopt portfolio positions. We invest in them. Internalizing this distinction is important. 

Adoption implies use. We could adopt commodities for use, but the data suggests that ain’t happening.
504 2018-11-09 16:50:18 Unfortunately not, if you have a look for either Joey Carbstrong or James Aspey on YouTube they'll show you what goes on everywhere. Also look for @vivacampaigns who show what happens in the UK, it doesn't matter where you are in the world animals are used as commodities.

509 2018-11-09 16:36:22 Depends on what you trade. Commodities/FX have reflected this mood, in spades. I would suggest the market has beaten down commodities/EM-FX, and moved that money into "safe haven" FAANG and such. A sort of "a little bit pregnant" kind of acknowledgement, in terms of FF action.
510 2018-11-09 16:31:50 To recap

There was an opening bell vomit in commodities, to which quality mining and exploration, as well petroleum and natural gas, sold off in panic sells. 

Highly predictable pattern.

Value buying came in. Fundamentals matter.

Be the predator, attack fear.

571 2018-11-09 13:08:56 It made that kind of move in the 1970s with a paper market. Remember, Gold went up 4x in 1979 alone, which can make such a ratio fall quite rapidly. As for Silver: the 1970s was a general commodities bull market with high wage and price infla., which is why Silver outperformed.

578 2018-11-09 12:56:53 Follow the money. It starts there. And sadly, despite our lofty American ideals, that money often starts here. But that has always been true. Royal dowries funded armies; marriages were arranged as peace and trade agreements. Oil and cheap labor are 2 of today's hot commodities.
579 2018-11-09 12:56:28 Hence production was not for exchange but for the plan and thus products did not really assume the form of commodities. Secondly, since there was no real commodity exchange, but simply a planed transfer of products, there could be no real money in USSR. (9)
580 2018-11-09 12:56:20 Still sad Mr President. You haven't addressed our plights. The issue of prices of basic commodities is my worry.
581 2018-11-09 12:54:44 This becomes clear, they argue if we examine these 'capitalist forms' more closely. Firstly, it may appear that in the USSR that production took the form of production for exchange and hence products took the form of commodities. (6)

587 2018-11-09 12:38:17 Thank you. Unfortunately most of the produce will be fresh commodities which we have no facilities to store.
588 2018-11-09 12:36:57 Trading in commodities is acceptable mode of doing business worldwide. Kenya is no exemption from the rule. If govt cannot provide finance for NCPB in time then traders have to step in and do the trading. Its not offence and illegal in the trade. Let's not shrink the thinking
589 2018-11-09 12:34:11 It’s not convenient, they practice indifference to farm animals as it’s easier to think of them as commodities than thinking,feeling beings. Good farmers show duty of care & their stock responds so both win. Bad farmers too dumb & lazy to realise that.
590 2018-11-09 12:30:38 Women as commodities. Different cultures perpetuate that notion in different ways. In NA it's propagated by advertising.
591 2018-11-09 12:27:57 This is why it is literally a matter of Chinese national security to price commodities in CNY, why CNY oil a potential game changer.  If China can print CNY for commodities, risk of a CNY BoP crisis gets mitigated significantly.
592 2018-11-09 12:26:01 How about just fucking doing something. Prayers and tears. Worthless commodities.

595 2018-11-09 12:09:46 No. Children are not commodities. It shouldn't be about advertising children like products to peruse. How awful to grow up and realise your face was plastered all over the internet to try to find someone who wanted you (or the idea of you). Just my thoughts as an #adoptee.
596 2018-11-09 11:59:04 It will be the creditors problem. Sovereign default on a massive scale. World demand for commodities will plummet.
597 2018-11-09 11:58:21 The rich can afford shares on ZSE & hard currency
The poor can only afford basic commodities 
But the reason behind the purchases was the same; hedging against inflation. 
Fear of inflation was a result of RTGS/Nostro seperation
598 2018-11-09 11:57:04 All you read abt in Zim is corruption,theft & all sorts of abuse of office.We even know them by name BUT wait for it, they still roam around town, still drive their fancy cars while the citizen pays for it thru the nose. The stupid 2% tax, shortages of basic commodities and and
599 2018-11-09 11:56:04 Queda IBOV está ligada as commodities. Principalmente Petróleo que caiu de 86 pra 69.

Bons negócios.
600 2018-11-09 11:54:58 For other services and commodities, the more you buy the less you pay per unit— KPLC is the only one provider with a peculiar system that punishes those who consume more
601 2018-11-09 11:54:21 It's a process, not a event. We need change our mind looking commodities appeal or new fresh alliances with USA, Israel, England et all. Maybe Arabia and his allies too. We need understand new Silk Road impacts and create new comercial routes as Iberian kings did.
602 2018-11-09 11:52:29 Capitalism thrives on your addiction, it thrives on your weakness in the face of its tantalizing, poisonous, commodities.
603 2018-11-09 11:49:44 Sim, concordo plenamente com você! Mas o Ibovespa subiu com $ dos BRs , contra todos os EMM só no entusiasmo. O mundo está desacelerando e as commodities, mais importante, muito. Então o cenário é de no máximo andar de lado. E não esta explosão toda destes dias
604 2018-11-09 11:48:06 I don't get why it would matter what people were buying, whether it was shares, basic commodities, fridges or hard currency. The fact is people were panic-buying to hedge against inflation, as you said.
605 2018-11-09 11:46:16 all kind of esencial commodities price hike is the common minimum programme to develope their pocket
606 2018-11-09 11:36:18 These entities get paid in dollars for their commodities too.
607 2018-11-09 11:32:45  another senseless tweet from a finger happy fame seeking illiterate.. so for the hike in some commodities due to inflation and some loose economic decisions.. u prefer the white man rules over u..  for urself.. if u no get brain  we get some wai..
608 2018-11-09 11:31:47 Chamgebis good but not when we have a KRA that is hell bent to frustrate importers of basic commodities
609 2018-11-09 11:29:36 So do you think parallel exchange rates, omir & ZSE market cap all surged because of 2% please explain how? 
The elite bought shares & hard currency as a hedge against inflation.
The ordinary bought basic commodities but the reason was the same.
Isn't Bloomberg a major biz paper
610 2018-11-09 11:28:17 Pls compare the prices of fuel & commodities pre1999 when @atiku & @Chief_Obasanjo took over from the Military. Price of commodities were alot cheaper than when Atiku and obasanjo left and worsened by the end of GEJ administration..
611 2018-11-09 11:20:51 This must be banned. Can't they see their fear. They have souls. They are not commodities.. they are not medicine or money...
612 2018-11-09 11:20:28 The banker who trades in commodities is a murderer.
613 2018-11-09 11:15:02 The article missed the point this time. People were trying to preserve value as a result of the splitting of RTGS and FCA accounts. Those at the lower end bought commodities like cooking oil those at the upper end bought for ex or invested in the ZSE. Capital preservation.  Fact
614 2018-11-09 11:06:31 500% increase in prices of basic commodities  is too much yet no employment .....pakaipa
615 2018-11-09 11:01:39 All that is missing at the moment, as we continue to watch commodities melt and signal a global economic slowdown, is a complete collapse of the US stock market and economy. Likely will play out in the next few months as we enter recession.
616 2018-11-09 11:00:24 You can only deceive the ignorant of the concept of inflation. So as long as inflation isn't 0%, how do you expect prices to be cheaper now that 3yrs ago. Did Atiku's regime make commodities cheaper than during military era?
617 2018-11-09 10:48:22 @SiyaXuza - Hi Siya - I am an ex Anglo Scholar as am assiting them with innovation. Anglo American Buld Commodities is having a technology accelerator forum 4-6 December and I have recommended you as a guest speaker on diruptive innovation as I have been following your story
618 2018-11-09 10:45:45 That’s the issue with “stockpiling”. As you use it, you have to replenish it. You also have to turn over life-limited commodities. Unless it’s a one-off stockpile to cover a time/demand limited period. It’s quite complex mathematics. (I am -was-  a professional logistician. )
619 2018-11-09 10:42:28 Chinês comprando commodities ja que a moeda segue desvalorizando
620 2018-11-09 10:41:41 Sir, is our lives better under democracy dan military? No! Should we then go back to military rule? No! How much did PDP meet prices of commodities in 1999 and how much did it leave it at in 2015? Progress is not abt having things  now, it is about planning for the future!

623 2018-11-09 10:21:48 Up till now, I do not understand why the Ghana Commodities Exchange is not in let's say Kumasi or Ejura but it is in Accra! Most of the commodities on the exchange will be coming from mostly northern part of Western Region, Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Eastern and Volta Region.
624 2018-11-09 10:12:12 Today, as it recent days, you will notice considerable discussion of falling markets, concerns of a variety of commodities and the general fear one should expect from the herd.

Be the contrarian, avoid the herd for they are headed to the slaughter.
625 2018-11-09 10:00:26 Resonates so strongly with what I hear in workshops with the public - they want action on #climatechange but don't know who they can trust to deliver that. Honesty and integrity are scarce commodities.

631 2018-11-09 09:18:29 According to your logic no one should try to change anything. Maybe the status quo works for you. But the way we treat animals like laughable commodities desperately needs to change.

633 2018-11-09 08:59:30 The only real #decentralized_asset is #Cryptocurrency, well it would be challenging if someone wants to confiscate your #digital_currency compared to physical commodities.
634 2018-11-09 08:49:09 Conservatives have no principles, they are merely commodities to be bought and sold.
635 2018-11-09 08:44:51 Can you please stop with this? How many people enjoy the value chain please? If 10 people in a locality of over 20000 persons benefit, what exactly is the value chain that has been created? Trader moni handouts that are not enough to match the astronomical prices of commodities?
636 2018-11-09 08:35:33 No, I agree here, we may need a central administration (not called government, as it implies authority) to take care of public goods, but not commodities (education, healthcare), and definitely notnwelfare. Charity should be private.
637 2018-11-09 08:34:56 Yes, the Feds do it all the time, it is called in rem or quasi in rem jurisdiction and they do it to recover U.S. based funds, property, or commodities obtained in foreign countries. Happens every day. Whether these yahoos want to admit it or not.

642 2018-11-09 08:01:58 That’s if you believe houses should be commodities. Clearly we fundamentally disagree on this. I don’t see a crisis of middle income earners wanting to become speculators and “climb up the ladder”. I wanna destroy the ladder and ensure everyone has a fundamental right to a home.

674 2018-11-09 05:55:07 My key argument isn't that Trump colluded with Russia, just that Russia interfered with the election in numerous ways. That is a well-accepted fact that even Trump himself has said as much. Yet he delayed sanctions, continually defends Putin, and has yet to speak out against him.

691 2018-11-09 03:56:50 Absolutely we need to. Subversion is powerful. The EZLN sadly still live under Capital, hence why they sell & produce commodities (i.e. Coffee) to help finance their own self-reproduction.
692 2018-11-09 03:54:15 You just said commodities can’t be securities . In your other post . Look I’m done here.
693 2018-11-09 03:52:30 You just said that commodities can’t be securities yes? So what the hell are u arguing with me for.
694 2018-11-09 03:49:12 Xrp is not a security . The federal courts ruled all digital assets are commodities. A commodity can’t be a security. Ripple goes to court for class action suit they will win because they are not a security. The sec usually doesn’t go against the federal courts. How is that wrong
695 2018-11-09 03:42:30 Well tell me how I’m wrong then ? What is wrong ? Commodities are not securities
696 2018-11-09 03:38:50 Neither you nor I have any idea whether XRP (uh, not Ripple?) will be classified a security. 

Your commodities argument is completely wrong. 

Securities litigation/federal jurisdiction are topics that are out of your realm of understanding.
697 2018-11-09 03:32:52 Lol you are so patronizing look I’m sticking by what I said . Ripple will not be classified as a security!!!  Yes?!? The federal courts already deemed all digital assets commodities! Yes?!? So what I’m asking u is what is your issue here? Yes
698 2018-11-09 03:28:20 But she didnt say what she said or something. 

As you know babies are wrongly a commodity in adoption. So any comparisons to other commodities just reinforces that wrongly held narrative.

700 2018-11-09 03:25:12 nesse paiseco em subdesenvolvimento tecnologico e subexistente em agro-pecuária e outras commodities que malemá o consumidor de quase 200 milhões de celulares consegue pagar um período pré-pago, e as taxas mais sem sentido do mundo
701 2018-11-09 02:59:47 Your welcome  and I appreciate you finding such great information. Also federal court in the US already ruled that all digital assets are commodities already. And nothing can  be classified as both a security and a commodity. So Ripple will come out on top.
702 2018-11-09 02:59:35 By Asia, you mean Singapore  I was posted there for six years in a Commodities house. Loved the experience, great city to live in, but as soon as my son turned two, packed up and headed back to Canada. It’s way too competitive.. not a place to stay in the long term

704 2018-11-09 02:46:35 A lot of these things are consistent with Filipino culture - which is why Philippines still languishes so far behind. Deference to seniority leads to poor knowledge sharing and innovation. Treating staff like commodities doesn't make anybody enthusiastic and loyal to the Co.
705 2018-11-09 02:46:15 Be cool to see khabib vs. GGG in kazakstan or Russia it  would potentially be huge since both are hot commodities there.
706 2018-11-09 02:32:50 IF COLLECTIONS GONE UP SO WHY NOT TO CUT DOWN/REDUCE COST OF ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES AT THIS JUNCTURE FOR SUBSTANCIAL ENHANCEMENT IN YOUR VOTE BANK TO RETAIN POWER FOR ANOTHER 5 YRS PLEASE.
707 2018-11-09 02:30:53 No discussions on unemployment and price rice of essential commodities or future developments. Ram statue and Aiodhya is still the basic necessities of million of Indians.Let voters ask their needs than politicians considering  voters as refugees and devotees in a temple.
708 2018-11-09 02:28:31 reason Soros is not arrested or others is Bc of power over trillions in currencies/commodities & stock/bonds & money markets - it is like a nuke threat to all govts - electronic trading & unregulated investment companies can cause massive loss of wealth to nations
709 2018-11-09 02:27:58 Counterfeiting commodities will continue to confuse customers
710 2018-11-09 02:27:24 Negros na ala de serviço.... É isso não vai mudar c conservadores mandando nesse país. Não eqto tirarem recursos da educação. Não eqto formos ainda uma colônia vendendo commodities e importando tecnologia sucateada. Um país só se desenvolve c educacao.

716 2018-11-09 01:59:09 The "market" that the Fed should pay attention to isn't necessarily the domestic stock market as much as markets that are sensitive to forward inflation, global economic growth,  demand for $$'s and industrial commodities. Once again, Mr Trump is likely intuitively correct.
717 2018-11-09 01:51:26 Qto otimismo c as reformas o sr. tem q seremos "uma nova China"? rs 
Brasil tem o q os chineses precisam em commodities, mas precisamos desenvolver o q eles já têm: tecnologia. Demoraria uns 40 anos c uma população envelhecida. Tem como, ainda, sem uma revolução na Educação?

720 2018-11-09 01:40:43 Ohh! I love this idea of challenging students to track their food! This would be a great project in my Exploratory Ag class with 8th graders when we discuss ag commodities! #TeachAgChat
721 2018-11-09 01:27:52 Like I said, to each their own. Enjoy your prospects love fest. I'll stick to wanting a team of known commodities to try to get this team a title.
722 2018-11-09 01:10:43 Banks - governments print cash more than that is required to enable transactions in the economy people will tend to absorb that into stocks-assets. This will create trading in assets abnormally. Scarcer services and commodities will cost more and lastly it ends in inflation.

726 2018-11-09 00:40:49 Bill, you are a pioneer and I totally understand what you are saying. Every FO in MLB (any sport really) treats players as commodities, one guy leaves, another walks through the door that same day. No player IS the game and no player is BIGGER than the game
727 2018-11-09 00:38:00 As re to the strong dollar: remember how strong  commodities were in 2008 before the SHTF? Markets are dark , pools are hidden, stats are bogus.Tankers were offshore holding oil they couldn’t unload in 2008 while oil was bogus priced-fixed  @ 100 before collapsing to 30.
728 2018-11-09 00:37:51 Jonas - is there a benchmark or a published source to track inflation in the United States?

For example you can track stocks or commodities - any such tool for inflation?
729 2018-11-09 00:34:49 The harder bet is AmazonPrime. Shows have become commodities (bundle a show-runner/writer/producer/talent) and Bezos can set all mkt salary with AMZN equity. Movies+Music+Food+All other consumer goods...

735 2018-11-09 00:29:23 It is almost time for Northwestern MBB vs. Plaisance Jr. & New Orleans. I will really be watching Ryan Greer because these Wildcats do not have a lot of proven backcourt commodities past Ryan Taylor, Gaines & Jordan Ash to go with that stout frontcourt in both quality & quantity.

738 2018-11-09 00:13:40 Yes, but consistently fewer USDs if China can print CNY for the ~50-60% of their imports that are commodities.  And if China can price both oil & gold in CNY, it can control the intl trade value of USD...
