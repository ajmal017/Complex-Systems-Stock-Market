151 2018-02-17 23:34:23 Another option, slice eighths, drizzle with olive oil sprinkle on cumin, maybe some hot pepper and roast. When done finish with something sweeet/sour like balsamic, pomegranate Seeds and maybe cilantro
152 2018-02-17 23:34:19 Tea tree oil!!
153 2018-02-17 23:34:10 C'mon Oil tie it up
154 2018-02-17 23:33:49 The Department of the Interior announced Friday that a sale of 77.3 million acres of leases on the Southeast coast for oil and gas exploration will occur on March 21.
155 2018-02-17 23:33:46 In other news, doing another tumeric and olive oil hair treatment. I was pleased with the results of the last one.
156 2018-02-17 23:33:36 Would have been way cooler if they were oil derricks instead of bicycles.

158 2018-02-17 23:33:11 At the moment, that is perhaps true, but Scotland has been a net contributor for a long time in the union. Even before oil and gas. Also the only part that ran at a trade surplus last year.

163 2018-02-17 23:32:49 Do they go to one room in the house and dip their faces in groundnut oil ? Then come back and talk .. why they greasy ?
164 2018-02-17 23:32:29 It's a marathon blood match in B right now. Stoltenberg leaking oil
165 2018-02-17 23:32:27 You are aware that 'actual sources' are available via the web too, eh? Wasn't aware that folks mined oil or gas - both of which are currently very valid resources and why Scotland wants to take care of itself (that and they don't want Brexit) and why May wants to keep them.
166 2018-02-17 23:32:18 Sitting in the movie theatre and it smells of patchouli, coconut oil, and essential oils....I’m here for it  #blackpanthermovie
167 2018-02-17 23:32:10 The oil and natural gas capability of US as #1 producer is the great weapon to force enemies to stop attacks and will convince allies to follow our lead Pull the rug out from under the Russian and Iranian economy based on oil & gas Quick and visceral solution

174 2018-02-17 23:31:31 In other words. People cannot "protest" an Oil Drill Rig that would polute our oceanic waters, Lady Chairwoman. I like that you've stated "silently". Which in "fact" it means he "sneaked" around corners to undermine democracy. @FBI . I would "check" those "tax returns" again from

179 2018-02-17 23:30:04 Really, " the survival of our species?" So the world should shut down all production of oil and gas throw the world into the worst economic calamity we have ever seen, and ride our bikes to work, in winter, in Canada. You are truly misinformed
180 2018-02-17 23:29:46 It's a very poorly designed experiment, as I'll never know what the winning combo is. But the cool-most humidifier is pretty neat, and has a spot for oil diffusion!

182 2018-02-17 23:29:33 @JoeysCanada hey Joey’s. I can’t find your allergy information anywhere. Do your fish and chips have soy (including cooking oil) or dairy?

188 2018-02-17 23:28:07 Not buying it 1 bit. Has an INDEPENDENT viewer concluded the same thing? This sounds like having an oil company investigate their oil leak.

192 2018-02-17 23:26:54 Asian nations are not interested in our goods and services.  They want oil, gas, minerals, lumber, wheat, food.  That is it - all industries that Trudeau is piling restrictions and regulations on..

He won't enforce sanctions against Putin. He allows sanctioned Russian spies in America. Is allowing sanctioned Russian oil in
197 2018-02-17 23:25:18 ...and big government spending in the defense industry, and for farm and oil subsidies...

204 2018-02-17 23:24:09 New @ParklandInst report looks at implications of the Paris Agreement for Alberta’s Big 5 oil sands corporations:
205 2018-02-17 23:23:56 Le proiezioni sono a dati costanti il che vuol dire che potrebbero non avverarsi se mutano le variabili. Es. Negli anni settanta si era certi della fine delle riserve petrolifere nei 30 anni successivi. Nessuno sapeva che sarebbe nato lo shale oil. Appunto la variabile esclusa
206 2018-02-17 23:23:41 Well with fertilizer you need some fuel oil and a booster. Shameful of you to use that dead child and that heroic firefighter in this manner.

216 2018-02-17 23:21:13 I like the vape, I got the lavender vanilla one. The oil tastes pretty weed-y which I’m not crazy about but it’s ok. I haven’t feel any effects yet but I haven’t taken very much either
217 2018-02-17 23:21:03 As a qualified accountant I thought the oil projections were hugely optimistic and naive, economic argument was all over the shop.
218 2018-02-17 23:20:35 Defo wanna see if CBD oil is worth it. Been contemplating it for a while and now that Holland and Barrett have started selling it I may as well give it a shot.

222 2018-02-17 23:20:09 In the BC tanker debate, the decks are stacked against the conservation side, because almost all of the marine oil spill experts have been co-opted by the oilpatch. I try to level the playing field, thereby giving the conservation side a decent chance of winning the argument.
223 2018-02-17 23:20:04 I’m finally using oil paints but I feel like I did something wrong 
224 2018-02-17 23:19:42 That still does not need to be emplimented, this tax was to allow pipelines to be built, nothing east, and you and Justin are stalling until the latest pipe is scrapped.
Why do you hate Alberta and her oil so much? Please answer or rebate Alberta the tax you have taken !
225 2018-02-17 23:19:41 Probably smells like all shea butter and Jamaican black castor oil  Enjoy! It is well worth it!
226 2018-02-17 23:19:36 Life Pro Tip: If your black jacket and the only good piece of clothing that you have gets oil paint on it, don't try to cover it up with acrylic or fabric paint that's also black. It doesn't work.

Infringement of Indigenous Rights
Increased oil tanker traffic in our waterways

More......
250 2018-02-17 23:15:31 Yes! It’s still there? Tremendous - a quality excuse for a trip back to the Boro. I’m hoping the Boro fish bar has either closed, or changed the cooking oil since I left in 1994 
251 2018-02-17 23:15:25 Keeping the AB economy drowned in oil is not to stimulate the transition or investment in future technology, but rather is indended to smother it further.

252 2018-02-17 23:14:59 Yep. Been in that very same boat. But a recent lesson with all metal hotends, get PLA too warm and it gets sticky and starts acting unextruded and working the extruder. Two options go cooler or add a drop of oil.
253 2018-02-17 23:14:41 David Suzuki is just another anti development, angry, hysterical environmentalist, who will stop at nothing to destroy Albertas oil sands projects. I can hardly wait until you become Premier and push the pipeline to completion so I can watch Suzukis' hair spontaneously combust!
254 2018-02-17 23:14:34 One is the hydrophilic end and that binds to the water molecules and the other is the hydrophobic molecule and that binds to the grease and oil. The two ends work together to clean hands more effectively.

256 2018-02-17 23:14:29 You have to admit, golf instructors deserve some of the scorn. So much nonsense, snake oil, gimmicks, and scams over many years. I know you don’t fall into this category, but that is part of the history, and it still is.
257 2018-02-17 23:14:25 Perfect.  Lets pull oil and gas royalty payments to teachers wages and pensions. Action not inaction.
258 2018-02-17 23:14:01 There is NO doctor in the vicinity. That is a lie. You get a medical check from a doctor, then you go on the Purif with a Purif I/C who is just a Sea Org member. It’s 5 hrs a day. 30 mins running after taking up to 5,000 mg of niacin, tons of vits, salt & potassium tablets & oil.

270 2018-02-17 23:12:20 Literally caused by an oil change that went wrong. It was driven less than a mile after, but put enough aerated oil into the engine that it knocked the timing chain off a peg.
271 2018-02-17 23:12:04 What the nation needs is false prophets like you to just take your snake oil & pitch forks & go away. Better yet!  pray for yourself !
272 2018-02-17 23:11:35 NO NO NO. Keep on using your Dem logic. Keep seeing the work through Blue Glasses. Just know that as long as we Americans kill hundreds of thousands of people a year, for regime change and oil, we have Kharma coming our way.
273 2018-02-17 23:11:31 The price per barrel would go down with a supply shock. 
Yes, the U.S. has a stranglehold on our oil exports. 
We need to examine this non-renewable resource to maximize it's utility for our next generation while minimizing our human footprint, Myself included!

275 2018-02-17 23:11:23 I'm thankful that our state lawmakers are actually being smart about this issue. CBD oil could really help the opiod crisis and, by extension, the HIV and Hep C crises.

277 2018-02-17 23:10:55 But, you and me together would be like a four alarm fire at an oil refinery.
278 2018-02-17 23:10:47 Yes, that was during the 1994 Clinton “assault weapon” ban. Timothy Mcveigh couldn’t get an AR15 so he used a mixture of fuel oil & fertilizer to blow up a building and kill 168 people, men, women and children.

286 2018-02-17 23:09:15 There is a report by @SDPIPakistan on Pakistan's latent MTOE (Million tons of Oil Equivalent) potential (incl shale) with recoverables approximately 5 times those recoverable in Central Asian Republics (combined)... I'll dig it up and link it

294 2018-02-17 23:07:07 I have. I have also accepted money from oil and gas. Doesn't mean I always vote in their interest or support their positions (usually, quite the opposite). If you can get $1.50/pack through both chambers & avoid  a veto referendum, more power to ya.

299 2018-02-17 23:06:28 I honestly believe that the NRA has so completely flooded the GOP with cash, that they will do whatever they're told. The same goes for the oil and pharmaceutical industries, but they cross party lines more often
300 2018-02-17 23:06:28 With help from a friend, I changed my front brakes and rotors, and did an oil change on my GTI. I'm proud of myself!
301 2018-02-17 23:06:21 I've been waiting to get my oil changed for 2 hours and 3 people have come and gone before me. Starting to wonder if I gave my car to the wrong person.

304 2018-02-17 23:05:42 Dear Diary, 
It's Saturday night & I just had a heart to heart with my Uber driver Dennis. He told me that "the world is my oyster" but oysters are functionally extinct & lack any significant ecosystem due to overfishing & recent oil spills. I'm crying at the pregame.

307 2018-02-17 23:05:08 This oil change is becoming expensive.
308 2018-02-17 23:04:53 @xhillzy sent you a snap  first sight of spring and the bronzing oil comes out 
309 2018-02-17 23:04:45 If I am in WalMart, I go to the oil change checkout. It prevents the chaos of kids grabbing for candy and As Seen on TV merch at the front. The walk back of the store to the car is an Oregon Trail type journey. We do have provisions in the cart to make it. #dadlife #nobisontho

315 2018-02-17 23:03:25 The only mascara that doesn’t irritate my eyes is Lash Paradise from (from L’Oréal) and the only eye make up remover I can use is from Marcelle (oil fee). Hope this helps! 
316 2018-02-17 23:03:09 A full tank of gas at 18 is comparable to a full oil tank in your 30s
317 2018-02-17 23:03:08 It would be alot higher with pipelines, we are losing a third because we ship our oil mostly to US by rail, we do not have anyother big costomers because we can't get our product to the coasts.
I would love to see the aboriginals working along side the rest of us.
318 2018-02-17 23:02:59 The oil industry pays teacher salaries thru provincial taxes. The more you promote hurting the oil industry there’ll be less in salaries, in class funding & layoffs. Your students families work in the oil industry. The hell with them, right?

321 2018-02-17 23:02:50 Maybe every rail car that wants to pass through Alberta from BC should be unloaded here inspected and taxed. Better yet maybe we should stop the flow of oil from our pipelines to BC so they can have 10x as many tankers come into the coast.
322 2018-02-17 23:02:49 That's the thing about art. Everyone sees something different whether it be good, bad or indifferent. I'm glad they aren't the stodgy oil paintings like the others.
323 2018-02-17 23:02:46 Was good banter but now your just flat out lying mate, hop back on your bandwagon fueled by oil money. Lol
324 2018-02-17 23:02:42 But if it was illegal to bribe politicians in the first place it wouldn’t be an issue. The NRA, big pharma, oil industry etc shouldn’t run your country (they do). Put the power back in the peoples hands and let the chips fall where they may. Couldn’t hurt
325 2018-02-17 23:02:27 A new record long/short? What caused the recent drop of oil prices then?
326 2018-02-17 23:02:15 Friendship and money. Oil and water .
327 2018-02-17 23:02:15 Alhamdulillah fr a fulfilled day
328 2018-02-17 23:02:01 @Mazda_UK so it seems that ‘intelligent servicing” means our cx5 tells us when oil needs changed...which it did on rannoch moor in middle of night = car towed to Inverness = no car for a week and we are £450 poorer. Explain logic of this?
329 2018-02-17 23:02:01 @Oil_Guns_Merica @TIME I'm offended
330 2018-02-17 23:01:44 Every crude price is equal to the  benchmark+quality premium, e.g. WTI+quality premium. The 40-45api has less heavy residue/fuel oil and more gasoline/naphtha than the other two. Residue/fuel oil sell at discount to benchmark while gasoline/naphtha can sell at premium

332 2018-02-17 23:01:09 Yes, luckily the goods on train weren't dangerous. Worth noting oil is transported more safely in pipelines than via train. Yep, pipelines are ~democracy, the worst except for all the rest.
333 2018-02-17 23:01:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and beaten to death with a hammer.
334 2018-02-17 23:01:08 Astonishing isn’t it, that educated and experienced politicians and bureaucrats couldn’t see what, to any reasonable person who’d paid a bit of attention to how the world works, was blindingly obvious. I think the smoke from all those oil wells got in their eyes. 
335 2018-02-17 23:00:40 We need a name/title for the annual Lucas Oil Dirt Late Model Series event.
336 2018-02-17 23:00:28 You must take responsibility for the HELL you have caused hard working oil workers. Coast to coast, Canadians will be happy when we can  kick you to the CURB with TRUDEAU in 2019! Then we will get right back to work on our VERY profitable OIL business!!
337 2018-02-17 23:00:21 80 for a oil change 
338 2018-02-17 22:59:59 That's a small amount. The money being invested in keeping Alberta oil production down and landlocked is many orders more. Sue BC into perpetual poverty.
339 2018-02-17 22:59:21 42! years pal, socialism has been destroying venezuela since 1976. That was the year oil industry was nationalized. That was the last year per capita GDP made a new high. That event created the income disparity that got chavez elected and the corrupt empresario government.
340 2018-02-17 22:59:16 S/O to my favorite woodman’s employee @Rupakus_1 for changing my oil today
341 2018-02-17 22:59:11 Goodness. Have you tried some smooth music, a candlelit warm bath, an oil rub or perhaps some subtle lighting? Its so good for high stress and anger. 
But don't get your lasers wet, it could cause problems.
342 2018-02-17 22:58:52 Clout chasing aint new. Your parents probably did it. Reason why you a joke.

"You're doing a good job." He added the pasta to the boiling water, then the butter and olive oil to the saute pan. 

"Now you can saute the garlic for a minute or so. >

346 2018-02-17 22:57:20  Humanity has definitely taken a step back thanks to social media and other tools. Humans are honestly all trash, ready to just go find work on an oil rig for he rest of my life, i've already had enough
347 2018-02-17 22:57:11 US increases inventory with stolen Syrian oil.  Watch oil price fall on the stock market.
348 2018-02-17 22:56:58 Sorry don't believe that the men and women in our military fight for our ideals, they fight for our interests which are based in oil. Our foundational principles are worthy, justifying wars so we can stay on top economically is a different story.
349 2018-02-17 22:56:57 I love a good at home spa day. There’s nothing quite like exfoliating, being smooth and covered in body oil, wearing a silk robe in a room with scented candles. NUH-THING.

354 2018-02-17 22:55:37 I went to our local Co-op pharmacy for a bottle of eucalyptus oil. The oil, delivered in steam has been giving my raw lungs some blessed relief.
They weren't carrying generic oil, just trendy oil marketed toward the aroma therapy diffuser crowd.
Tiny bottle..28 bucks.
F.U. Co-op.
355 2018-02-17 22:55:24 I think the oil sheen sticks better and gives a different glow
356 2018-02-17 22:55:07 i just smoked cbd oil and i think it took 8 mos off my life
357 2018-02-17 22:55:03 today I learned that I do not know enough about cars to get my oil changed by myself

359 2018-02-17 22:54:45 Bought an essential oil diffuser AND a salt lamp... what stress? #anxiouscucumber
360 2018-02-17 22:54:05 jeez, that heavy black smoke, amh......I'll tell you that structure has some of the most noxious smoke when the live load in it burns. All the synthetic crap in furniture, appliaces, electronics. It looks like unrefined oil burning.
361 2018-02-17 22:53:58 I have often wondered how much CO2 could be extracted, and synfuel produced, if all those oceanic oil rigs (both exploration and production) were converted to ~450MW thermal synfuel plants.
362 2018-02-17 22:53:41 I was going to a get an oil change but I pulled into a Ford dealership in my lil Natasha and felt like a bean in a sea of overcompensation
363 2018-02-17 22:53:16 Aye, chill. Many of us Americans do not associate with those dick weeds bombing every oil related country under the sun. Personally it disgusts me and many others.
364 2018-02-17 22:53:09 How about making sure entities like the NRA don't set foot near Washington. I'm sure that would help. Or lobbying by groups that harm society like big oil, cigarette companies and the like.
365 2018-02-17 22:53:06 Yup, which made everyone angry because we demand all our heroes be princes covered in robot oil

411 2018-02-17 22:45:33 Those bills need to be repealed, we have already seen oil spills, pipeline breaches since then.
412 2018-02-17 22:45:26 But oil can be exploited even in the so called insecure parts abi ??
413 2018-02-17 22:45:17 who knew they put oil in the radiator?!

416 2018-02-17 22:44:56 The cannabis oil you're suggesting, in the tweet I'm replying to?

It'd certainly cost more out-of-pocket than I'm paying for my SSRI, which is $0, even before whatever hoops I'd have to jump through to legally get it.
417 2018-02-17 22:44:54 I cant even put into words the miserable misguided criminals working on behalf of ETP. THEY make BILLIONS no matter what happens with oil after. Pipeline is Equity via profit which GETS TRANSFERRED to special shareholders' via another venue used for Market Exchange greed!
418 2018-02-17 22:44:51 Stop it. some of what Suzuki says is out to lunch. Some of it is dead on the money. So I would probably give him a standing O too, but not because I want the oil sands shut down. Why is it some of you people only have one narrow view?
419 2018-02-17 22:44:19 You refer above to the "West Coast tanker ban". Technically, there is no such thing. Rather, there's a North (& Central) coast crude oil moratorium (soon to be a ban), and a West Coast Tanker Exclusion Zone, which routes Alaskan tankers off the coast of Haida Gwaii and Van Isle.

427 2018-02-17 22:43:03 Also how about the culture? Do you think people will get interested in crypto there and start to invest in it? I know that arabian countries have different perspectives on finance and things like that. If those guys who invest in oil invest in crypto then things will be good :D
428 2018-02-17 22:42:59 Instead of using oil after the leave in, use it last after the moisturizer. That (LCO) method works better for me. I don’t have to use many oils now.

438 2018-02-17 22:42:02 Walk in the door, tournament director says it’s a 2-1 oil pattern. Shoot +53 and will miss cut by over 100. So by 2-1, you mean house shot. #ThanksForPlaying #TryAgain

440 2018-02-17 22:41:52 I didn’t put on makeup today. Just oil and I’m okay with it
441 2018-02-17 22:41:51 I REALLY wanna see Koch bros ilk, exploitative gas/oil corps, org crime rings, myriad kleptocrats, the likes of Pat Robertson & Franklin Graham & many mega churches, etc to be exposed, ostracized, stripped of assets & social tolerance. And financial industry reliably reined in!!

443 2018-02-17 22:41:31 China is the biggest import if oil in the world we need to ship oil to China 500 million barrels of oil a day.
Invest in free public transit to reduce traffic congestion and pollution.
444 2018-02-17 22:41:28 More precisely, should i say the expiry date of Israel is the date of United Arabs or dried up Arab oil wells, whichever is earlier.
445 2018-02-17 22:41:09 but you would have changed the timing of the outcome, not the outcome itself.

The same with the oil crises. that probably delayed the collapse of the sovet union.
446 2018-02-17 22:41:08 My grandfather was in the design team for the BP oil terminal that used to be there. Most of it was removed when the area was used for the channel tunnel fabrication plant.
447 2018-02-17 22:41:02 That’s why I love theirs. In the summer I add castor oil to it since I do more to my hair then. Have you tried the loc method?
448 2018-02-17 22:40:42 I’m getting an oil change right now.

458 2018-02-17 22:39:09 寝て
459 2018-02-17 22:39:03 Blimey that looks like a glass of crude oil!
460 2018-02-17 22:38:46 I have a friend that had Lyme’s disease. I know he used cannabis oil to kick it! He is fine today! Please try it....
461 2018-02-17 22:38:45 oh okay thank u ! did you get the spray? (if so do you know what it’s called) where I get my piercings from has the option to buy tea tree oil but that causes problems for me so thinking ahead in case I get them done
462 2018-02-17 22:38:26 So what if all this anti-Russia rhetoric was nothing other than the steam running off the moving train which is the oil reserves under the Arctic ocean?
463 2018-02-17 22:38:20 انا الممقدم 
464 2018-02-17 22:38:13 The deep conditioner is the best. As soon as it touches your hair, it’s melting. Their mint oil is  too. That’s the only oil I can use that actually stays in my hair.
465 2018-02-17 22:38:09 does anyone actually prefer natural peanut butter to the kinds that don't have a giant layer of oil on top
466 2018-02-17 22:38:00 Cobalt, uranium deposits, oil, potential hydroelectric, futile land, the list goes on for congo
467 2018-02-17 22:37:57 Tea, I'm so sick of his lies.  I can't watch him on TV and I refuse to follow him on Twitter.  Russians, NRA, Big Pharma, Oil Companies - they all own him.  The administration serves the rich and craps on the poor and middle class.  #TraitorTrump

470 2018-02-17 22:37:32 In defense ?? You must be mistaken! I hate that snake oil salesmen! I hope he looses everything he has and goes to prison.
471 2018-02-17 22:37:17 Cool another nail in my tire ... simple oil change turned into a whole big thing
472 2018-02-17 22:37:08 Also if u intend on using face oils just make sure they are 100% pure oil, then it makes no difference what brand
473 2018-02-17 22:36:47 How much more can the Oil be fleeced by the Islanders
474 2018-02-17 22:36:45 Creating DIY #Essential Oil #Lip Balms with Ashley Bennett so much fun !
475 2018-02-17 22:36:28 Copaiba essential oil
476 2018-02-17 22:36:27 I’ll bet GHW Bush did, many years in the oil & other businesses b4 becoming POTUS.  

4,000 seems a little low.
477 2018-02-17 22:36:06 Born in S.B. raised 30 miles North (Gaviota) Baby oil was the ticket for tar.
478 2018-02-17 22:36:04 By the way, what you gettin at the dealership?  (Hopefully not just a oil change lol)
479 2018-02-17 22:35:49 Again, the main hosts missed out on the opportunity to put forward those facts.

Anyway, weeks like those were why I was afraid abt the Helipad Week. Thankfully @JohnieP was a wonderful guest (she did the Oil Rig week for MoS) & the conversations were amazing & thought-provoking.
480 2018-02-17 22:35:45 Exactly you don't know what goes on behind the scenes to say they don't back him. Or they don't care. 
Difference is I wont demand they leave or tweet abuse to them because they don't have oil money and wont spend billions on Ronaldo or Messi. 

Let's agree to disagree now 
481 2018-02-17 22:35:40 when you too lazy to oil yo shit
482 2018-02-17 22:35:39 Buy One oil get another Free!! Starts Monday 19th Feb ends on the 23rd Feb! — feeling excited
483 2018-02-17 22:35:23 Put pepper oil on your gloves. Rub it in her eyes then stomp the shit out of her. Then mount her and pee on her to establish dominance.
Your welcome.
484 2018-02-17 22:34:59 Keep nails and cuticles adequately hydrated, by using a cuticle oil, hydrating hand cream, and exfoliating once a week, to ensure the moisturizer can penetrate
485 2018-02-17 22:34:58 tp ada tea tree oil tu. nnti lagi kering muka 
486 2018-02-17 22:34:57 Don't @ me about the bun...this is grass fed free-range beef that was hand massaged for weeks and perfectly cooked in avocado oil in a cast iron skillet.
487 2018-02-17 22:34:54 Es fuel oíl no fuel hoy
488 2018-02-17 22:34:50 Lemon Myrtle Oil is antibacterial and smells way better than bleach if you want a natural alternative. I have disgusting children so have use for both!
489 2018-02-17 22:34:22 she puts them in a shot glass of water and they go down pretty well. The oil in them is what helps people. They have to be alive or the oil dies. So she's done it for at least 3 mos. She had suffered for the last 10 yrs with it. And her leg is now the same size as the other.
490 2018-02-17 22:33:56 Looks like a decent project...I would have no idea where to start beyond changing the oil and brake pads and rotors, but I love watching shows of something that was junk turn into a functioning work of art.
491 2018-02-17 22:33:24 Right o let buy products from China mdewith someone else's oil.   Lose lose situation
492 2018-02-17 22:33:14 Ha ha. Another very rich snake oil salesman peddling God to the gullible masses. 
493 2018-02-17 22:32:53 What about all the Christian ones? Recently in Florida? Or is that not terrorism to you? Domestic terrorism is terrorism. War is terrorism but let’s just assume we’re over there for more than oil and leadership control.
494 2018-02-17 22:32:52 Tea tree oil smells terribly strong I hate but it helps 
495 2018-02-17 22:32:23 The oil pens are cool. Haven't really fucked around with much of the edibles and shit. Do like the gummies.
496 2018-02-17 22:32:19 ねみぃ……。
497 2018-02-17 22:32:14 Exactly! There’s no way to verify if Brian has actually put the vegemite on this at all. He says we can see it soaking through the break but that could just be oil / butter marks where it got soggy.
498 2018-02-17 22:31:57 You NEED some self-care! Drink a tall flavored magnesium drink.Take a soothing hot bath w/ Epsom salts (relaxes muscle tension & absorbs the magnesium your body needs) add a few drops of Lavender essential oil, Turn light off & light a candle. Listen 2 "Miracle Tone's" on YouTube
499 2018-02-17 22:31:52 yeah if only kindergarten spam-factories
(that's who you are nener-nener but who am I ?"
would craft their kewl stories tad more credibly

russia most definitely didn't want her,
because she rather colluded with chevron - which
colluded with UKRAINE drooling for their eastern oil
500 2018-02-17 22:31:23 Lemme take a wild guess.... 

It's to benefit the owners of the oil and gas extraction companies (a/k/a Donny's funders)?
501 2018-02-17 22:31:20 Yup. Zinc, L-arginine, and fish oil give you hentai loads.
502 2018-02-17 22:31:19 You mean you don't know Nigeria is an Oil producing country and can afford to power a generator for 3 months. It's all business strategy as it pulls more crowd and views when hosted abroad.
503 2018-02-17 22:31:19 I’m more than happy to talk to white men about food. Like this week I made Tuna Conserva (olive oil poached with fresh garlic and dried lemon) for the first time and I was pretty happy with it.
504 2018-02-17 22:31:17 Oklahoma has lost 8 of 10!! The Sooner Wagon looking like it needs some new wheels and a oil change. Time are rough on the old trail #Sooners
505 2018-02-17 22:31:05 Even worse seeing in the theatre when you realized that you had paid for it.
506 2018-02-17 22:30:40 We know the Truth but Being Petroleum Twitter Account I just Wish for #Oil to be free from #GeoPolitics.
507 2018-02-17 22:30:04 Fake dyes & fragrance oil when they can easily use essential oils. But I guess natural oils and wax don’t have the bright “Hawaii Beach” pink color & smell so they use fake ingredients.
508 2018-02-17 22:30:02 Coconut oil -OR- olive oil?
509 2018-02-17 22:29:45 I have the impression that they have great intelligence agencies as well. They are able to divide the west, influence elections and masses on social media, and the US to go back to wild west days as we are using coal to power our locomotives all because Russia is sitting on oil.
510 2018-02-17 22:29:41 @TwitterSupport @MorrisonFrank85 scammed me by pretending an oil rig man. He scammed for almost $30k
511 2018-02-17 22:29:15 they are either: 1- actively clueless and oblivious 2- aware and just raking in $ w/ what @jason_kint terms a junkmail empire. My take: a bit of both, led by a CEO whose personal comportment w/ competitors et al says it all=a monopolist à la Standard Oil, waiting for trustbust.
512 2018-02-17 22:29:14 I disagree. Let’s push this EEOC shit to its logical conclusion: Discrimination in employment for refusing to fuck someone based on race, etc should be illegal.
513 2018-02-17 22:29:11 Putting thc oil in my juul pod was one of the greatest things I ever did
514 2018-02-17 22:29:03 The truth hurts. Every time anyone uses the words oil company executive and sphincter in the same sentence Scott @EPAScottPruitt Pruitt's lips pucker up.
515 2018-02-17 22:29:03 Sure, lemons and olive oil which are basically full of acid components, would be great on an alkaline diet. You guys out of your minds?
516 2018-02-17 22:29:01 Imagine being d king in my village? With all d royalties paid by oil companies? Pls don't ask again, what am I "abroading" for?
517 2018-02-17 22:28:58 This oil change was supposed to take 45 minutes......it’s been an hour and a half and their still not done #NTB
518 2018-02-17 22:28:54 One conspicuous issue with energy sector, there has been no appreciation in prices of oil mktg cos in past 10-20-25 years despite their profitability good earnings they trade at lower PE and almost on similar price range.
519 2018-02-17 22:28:54 Yes girl. Tore a hole in it and had an oil stain 
520 2018-02-17 22:28:52 It used to be-but now we have so much violence our children are not safe 
We have a man in the WH who denies climate change, deregulated safeties for our air water environment oil rigs elderly in nursing homes Whether he colluded or not he obstructed the investigation w/denial
521 2018-02-17 22:28:38 Eating halloumi, fried in olive oil, drinking prosecco, watching twilight. Clash of cliches!! #omg #like
522 2018-02-17 22:28:38 @AskAmex still stuck up at Walmart. Been over 3 hours now. They won’t let me leave unless I pay for my oil change. So “B” or “Julie” can you front me come cash they got western union here. Sent like 3 bucks extra so I can get a coke and a bag of salted peanuts also. Thanks 
523 2018-02-17 22:28:36 I got those lavender essential oil air wick things so I am gonna be invincible breathing them in all the time.
524 2018-02-17 22:28:33 Canola oil for sure
525 2018-02-17 22:28:15 Athletes and celebrities are all about promoting themself, but when they think they think going to the White House will hurt their image, maybe the President should ask why? The Snake Oil doesn't work, so work one year with no vacation!!
526 2018-02-17 22:27:58 Tbh this just sounds like disordered eating to me. When I was really ill I used to measure out the oil I used *if* I used it and preferred spray oil always bc less oil.
527 2018-02-17 22:27:17 Tell them already bury me in ah coffin of oil and rum
528 2018-02-17 22:27:06 Just dropped my wireless beats in a pot of cooking oil BYE
529 2018-02-17 22:27:05 Yeah but all your buddies just can't seem to walk away from all of their gas & oil "opportunities" - that's why they quickly repealed transparency for foreign oil companies in Feb 2017
530 2018-02-17 22:26:45 “I’m no oil painting but..” has to be my all time favourite phrase
531 2018-02-17 22:26:40 Ive chosen to be sliced by knives and burned by hot oil as a career. I'm so fucking glad because it gives me purpose and I have goals
532 2018-02-17 22:26:18 Lmaoooo I drank too much water to do something that risky. I'll just stop and take a spoon of coconut oil. Should lubricate my throat till morning.
533 2018-02-17 22:25:54 Thank you.  Just annoys me? I know im not a special snowflake; however the use of almond oil means so many others can't use a whole host of products...
534 2018-02-17 22:25:44 Iraq, as for Oil its been Targetted by Many Since Long.
535 2018-02-17 22:25:33 They are now poisoning elephants who die in terrible agony as this victim.PALM TREES USED IN MANY FOODS & DRINKS ARE KILLING MANY TYPES OF  ANIMALS  LIKE THE ORANGUTAN IN ASIA.  PLEASE BOYCOTT ANYTHING THAT  CONTAINS PALM OIL & DERIVATIVES.
536 2018-02-17 22:25:17 US and her Allies controling the area which concern them most------- OIL  producing area
537 2018-02-17 22:25:13 I agree. I would support a complete shut down of the Port of Vancouver.  That way, absolutely no potential spills of any bad oil. Also, no little boats unless they are manually operated with oars. In other words, row, row, row your boat.
538 2018-02-17 22:24:41 In My Village , The Villager Are A Ground Cocoa , Cofee , Rice , Hevea , Oil Palme , They Seek A Help Finance For Develop The Agriculture
539 2018-02-17 22:24:40 Senator Tester you do realize that there a lot of Montana east of Billings that needs infrastructure rebuilding after the oil boom. Like what your staff said it's western Montana that will reelect you to the Senate
540 2018-02-17 22:24:14 My face doesn't get sweaty but iy is naturally like an oil slick so..?! Fortunately I've found a mattifying moisturised & astringent cleanser that helps that.
I have learned tonight that botox can be good but you have to wait for it to totally wear off b4 getting it again
541 2018-02-17 22:24:08 We love local Do- Gooders like you. But highly inflammatory ingredients like corn syrup/oil artificial flavors, refined sugars, palm oil don't enhance health,they damage it.Pls offer healthy bake-goods to enhance health not to make it worse!!
542 2018-02-17 22:24:05 Measure eight pounds of olive oil and set timer for 3 minutes.
543 2018-02-17 22:23:50 My future, secret Twitter account is just a large loaf of bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar staring out a café window.

545 2018-02-17 22:23:37 Firing squad seems cosmically just.
546 2018-02-17 22:23:34 Scotland in EU: 13 members (like Denmark), get a veto on Scots business, no need to use €, keep oil/gas revenue, raise own taxes, pay EU fee to trade with rWorld; NEVER start a war.  In UK? England decides all this.
547 2018-02-17 22:23:28 Explain then why a kleptocrat dictator dependent on high oil prices wanted a POTUS who supports US energy independence?
548 2018-02-17 22:23:13 In life we have to have to notice that some people just aren’t for you and you need to minimize contact with them. They might still be great people but remember water and oil are both useful just not together
549 2018-02-17 22:23:11 Why should we support a country that is not supporting itself. Nigeria has oil but imports petrol from Europe
550 2018-02-17 22:23:03 It's the best corn oil you'll ever drink.
551 2018-02-17 22:22:55 Poor the mob elves regularly oil it to keep it supple.
552 2018-02-17 22:22:42 BREAKING - Local hot dog eating enthusiast, Brau Keppleton, wins the World Wide Hot Dog Eating Contest of Bale County. The win came off a technicality as the self proclaimed, "Hammer," Doug Jangleson was disqualified for using vegetable oil instead of water to eat his hot dogs.
553 2018-02-17 22:22:30 Remember when Kanye West said "George Bush doesn't care about black people"? Well, I can say w/out hesitation that Republicans in general don't care whether we live or die, as long as their sponsors continue 2make profits: gun dealers, oil companies, etc.

Oil and water dont mix.

559 2018-02-17 22:20:55 Scotland in EU: 13 members (like Denmark), pay LESS in Defence, not forced €, keep own oil/gas revenue, raise its own taxes, pay an EU fee to trade with rWorld. NEVER start a war. In UK, England decides all this
560 2018-02-17 22:20:43 I'm so cultured right now... having nori chips made in truffle oil and seat salt 
561 2018-02-17 22:20:36 Oil off Pacific Coast; in our Treasured Public Lands; Oil drilling in Arctic; through our country from N to S like a bypass. What do you think he's doing with Putin? Until the deal is done and our country is sold out, he will look the other way.
562 2018-02-17 22:20:22 Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel is oil free and really light but moisturises very intensely and has helped clear my cystic acne
563 2018-02-17 22:20:14 We love local Do- Gooders like  Bubbie's BG. They are suppose to help with pain & inflammation but contain highly inflammatory ingredients: corn syrup/oil artificial flavors, refined sugars, palm oil. BBG, ppl need healthy bake-goods to enhance health not to make it worse!
564 2018-02-17 22:20:13 The best way to know quality olive oil is to sample it before you buy.  Every weekend, we are sampling our EVOO and olives at one of the retail outlets that sell our product from London to  Kingston Ontario
565 2018-02-17 22:19:53 Sorry to disappoint you mate. I've just poured loads of vegetable oil over it. 
566 2018-02-17 22:19:50 Important fact: The tankers won't be filled with bitumen. It'll be dilbit; bitumen in suspension with a condensate. Dilbit floats & is easier to skim as compared to oil alone. In the very unlikely event of a spill.
567 2018-02-17 22:19:37 Arab oil? You’re clearly an ignorant follower of the sport because not only are you jealous but you wish that Liverpool had a board like man city who actually spend money.... joke of a club
568 2018-02-17 22:19:21 While you at that recall some of your troops being used for peace keeping missions around the world aka keeping American interest safe like oil and post them at your schools where they need to be keeping the peace

578 2018-02-17 22:18:20 Ask when the timing belt/chain was last changed, get precise mileage, records if you can. Oil obviously. Check the oil cap for a yellowish green sludge. Check the intake and all its seals clamps and sensors. Get an HONEST answer about how hard the car has been driven.
579 2018-02-17 22:18:11 Just the olive oil n lemon juice

582 2018-02-17 22:17:41 I bet there's a ton of money to be made writing articles about how good solar power will be, & attacking oil moguls @englandx @john_sipher
583 2018-02-17 22:17:37 it'd produce good cooking oil.
584 2018-02-17 22:17:17 The midnight oil has all been burned but I'm still working.

588 2018-02-17 22:16:16 you mean olive oil / lemon juice / balsamic vinegar.... it goes well with goat cheese full tomato salad, haha right that got me hungers.
589 2018-02-17 22:16:10 I use fresh stuff. I blend together escallion, thyme, onion, ginger, sweet pepper, scotch bonnet, pimento seeds along with olive oil & keep in the fridge. Powder spices are usually black pepper, salt, cayenne pepper, dry yellow mustard & cumin. Have saffron for special occasions
590 2018-02-17 22:16:02 One never knows how many different filters a vehicle has until they try to sell you new ones at the oil change place.
591 2018-02-17 22:16:02 The new green economy based on a crucial fundamental energy shift will be tons more profitable than the sunset oil industry. This is is about our new shared future with hope as opposed to the current extra pyramidal benefits to the elitist society that Trudeau chooses to defend
592 2018-02-17 22:15:26 Since November, we blew a head gasket in kellys truck, we went and bought another car suppose to be mine. We blew a radiator 2 weeks after getting it then we blew a head gasket in it how to run a car for 7 weeks finally got a car back now we have an oil leak .

598 2018-02-17 22:13:27 Damn near $400 later... new breaks, oil change, and 2 new tires. Jesus!! 
599 2018-02-17 22:13:17 JLo is known to slim down with the grapefruit oil diet. Studies show smelling it can reduce one's appetite and help with portion control.
600 2018-02-17 22:13:16 Alright. Now let’s see how much money went to politicians from big oil and planned parenthood.

605 2018-02-17 22:13:09 Saturday special oil changes 10 buck , buy oil filter and oil
606 2018-02-17 22:13:04 Where have I ever said evil oil companies?  That is a conversation in your own mind.  It's good that your company is stepping up and remediating wells abandoned by other companies.  But why are those delinquent companies allowed to take the money and run?
607 2018-02-17 22:12:36 English : cooking oil
Venda : ndi petrol ya hu bika ngayo

608 2018-02-17 22:12:27 @FLGovScott Some of us haven't forgotten the Summit Venture 1980 and 3 barge oil spill in August 1993. 400,000 Gallons  Some of us spent mos cleaning up. You gonna dare it to happen again? Or dare us protesters? More jobs for Florida??  Another greedy politician
609 2018-02-17 22:12:10 You have divided the people with your lies, have alienated our allies, have given our $ to the rich through tax cuts, dismantled the EPA, taken park land for drilling oil, refused universal healthcare, and have done anything you can to hurt & take from the people.
610 2018-02-17 22:12:09 i bought an essential oil aromatherapy thing and my room finally doesn’t smell like ass. very therapeutic.
611 2018-02-17 22:12:03 Trust them. Leave it all in tether they are about as transparent as an oil slick
612 2018-02-17 22:11:45 صباح الورد يا محمود
613 2018-02-17 22:11:39 They have black olives which is a sought after commodity world over for its oil health benefits . Then you add the weather to boot.
614 2018-02-17 22:11:37 Haha the balls on you lot. Piss off back to your dirty oil money pit and stop pretending you give two craps about the planet, especially OUR BC COASTLINE!! Just cause you don't have one doesn't mean you can ruin ours 
615 2018-02-17 22:11:30 今日は幕張でえとたまのイベント(音泉のイベント)ですね〜
616 2018-02-17 22:11:23 How id love to oil you up.x
617 2018-02-17 22:11:16 It forces the panel against a die, bending the edge. It's made from sustainable palm oil. The zipper teeth can be attached.

619 2018-02-17 22:11:12 Oh yea I got this exfoliating scrub with tea tree oil and coconut
620 2018-02-17 22:11:01 Fear locks you up, like an engine without oil. It immobilizes you.
621 2018-02-17 22:10:48 sending you good productive vibes and a tight hug! you got it girl!!!! if you need a chat you can always call me or i can meet you somewhere with a nice big bottle of lavender oil
622 2018-02-17 22:10:34 Lol. Your hilarious.  Notley has done that (diversify)in Alberta in just 2 years! And she did it with 40-50$/ brl oil. Not the 100$ the last PC gov of 40 yrs squandered. There will be a pipeline. National interest greater than any one province.
623 2018-02-17 22:10:13 Endless oil story
624 2018-02-17 22:10:11 From Jersey Mr Heath then sailed with his child captives out to his Gaudi-oil-rig-style mid-ocean secret base where the nuclear subs he had captured underwrote his liberty. Mike Yarwood did a very good take on his distinctive chuckle as he threatened world leaders with Armageddon
625 2018-02-17 22:09:58 4 the 1's that don't know me! My dad(Morris Steve Craig) U. S M. All The Way !!!! I'm the youngest out of 6 youngions  !!! Grandparents 'Victor. T. Hali. Oil. Marie Hali
626 2018-02-17 22:09:58 Perhaps it has something to do with $500 Billion oil deals. The former CEO of Exxon Mobil had a $500,000,000,000 deal with Russia. Sanctions stop that from proceeding. Former CEO is now Secretary of State.
627 2018-02-17 22:09:47 "Corn syrup" is actually a made up marketing name like "canola oil" or "Chilean sea bass". It's actually semen.
628 2018-02-17 22:09:38 What are you talking about? The largest oil reserves in the world and they cannot feed their own people.the  has nothing to do with what is going on in . Socialism is the main problem back home,expropriation of privately own businesses, hunger,etc.
629 2018-02-17 22:09:35 "We give you freedoms*, you give oil"
*freedoms doesn't guarantee you won't die dismembered from drone attacks, have your city blown up into the stone age or that we won't install a puppet millitary junta that'll reign terror on the population.
630 2018-02-17 22:09:21 Of course Mr Profit - As an ANGS boy you would say that now... Yer man Von The Donk is about to taught a valuable lesson here... Keep your nose outa other peoples business... #UKOG #VonkTheDonk
631 2018-02-17 22:09:18 Nothing with a guy like Trump in the White House. He doesn’t care about Global warming or Climate change, He just don’t care.? He lets the Coal and Oil co. Do whatever they want, I hope someone has a plan or we’re all Doomed another species will be the least of our problems.
632 2018-02-17 22:09:10 We should save as much oil as possible in case we run out of wind and the sun.
633 2018-02-17 22:09:05 also, let's not forget what the number 1 African product brought to the US under AGOA is -- crude oil.
634 2018-02-17 22:09:02 Are there not enough oil and gas fields in Russia?
635 2018-02-17 22:08:51 He’s a great player no doubt. But needs to get the chip oil off his boots.... the fuckers always slipping over... just like Bristol away last year
636 2018-02-17 22:08:42 Let me clarify it takes half a barrel of oil to produce one barrel of oil from the tar sands.
637 2018-02-17 22:08:24 so they think the hamburger without the cheese is ok? Why not just use leaner meat and no by products, along with removing ALL chemicals? They could also get big air fryers instead of using oil to deep fry. Lots of ways to cut down on the fat they serve as opposed to just this
638 2018-02-17 22:08:06 Beauty Boo's...i got my hands on some rose hip oil for 6 bucks? Is that a good price?
639 2018-02-17 22:08:04 Closing the door to give chase to three whales are as freshets of blood and oil; on the subject; but excuse me.
640 2018-02-17 22:07:59 The difference is there’s no argument to be made about the right to drill for oil or not in the constitution. Therefore oil companies are not concerned with politics.
641 2018-02-17 22:07:51 Agreed 100%.  No debris. No oil. Just a single car spin. Takes a lap and a half to get up to speed too when they go green.  I'm more annoyed than anything at the end of these races
642 2018-02-17 22:07:29 Large and mid level producers often take on the burden in this way as a matter of good corporate citizenship. But I know, evil oil companies.
643 2018-02-17 22:07:22 Let me clarify it takes half a barrel of oil to refine the oil out of the sands to make one barrel of oil!
644 2018-02-17 22:07:21 U need to make the lemon juice oil tho
645 2018-02-17 22:07:20 A baseball bat to the head might knock the cogs loose with a little 3&1 oil.
646 2018-02-17 22:06:53 1) Let's not have minority on minority bashing.  It's all advancement in equality to have these two films succeed.
2) Black Panther never made me brownies at 2am with just eggs and canola oil.
647 2018-02-17 22:06:40 I’m BIG MAD about this oil change
648 2018-02-17 22:06:24 Coconut  oil 
649 2018-02-17 22:06:09 When I learned olive oil and cheese were same amount of fat, I stopped giving a fuck.
650 2018-02-17 22:06:00 @FLGovScott GOP must feel like they did with Garland in that your election to Senate is a slam dunk elsewise they wouldn't renege on promise to let oil drilling leases in Gulf waters. What are you going to do? Sit back and take the $$$ like Marko? Enjoy the protests
651 2018-02-17 22:05:56 Oil sands waste of recourses what does it take half the energy in processing the oil out of the sands. Leave the shit in the ground where it belongs!
652 2018-02-17 22:05:52 @dariusrucker today’s another great day to try something for the first time.  Today I tried not having anxiety while driving over the pit at the auto oil changing place.
653 2018-02-17 22:05:49 That also just reminded me that I’m overdue for an oil change.
654 2018-02-17 22:05:45 I've been working on a 200 well abandonment project all winter. The oil company I work for is doing dozens of wells and paying for them in full on the behalf of insolvent producers, deferring costs away from taxpayers. But I know, evil oil companies.
655 2018-02-17 22:05:40 Let’s keep the Trump train strong we need to win seats 2018 and keep the White House in2020.We have started our journey to make America great again But we need keep up the fight
656 2018-02-17 22:05:10 Coconut oil?
657 2018-02-17 22:05:07 Man, I agree.  Same with the armadillo.  We already have possums why do we need one with armor?
658 2018-02-17 22:05:07 BIG thank you to everyone who came by to today's Sonic The Hedgehog 2 stream, we didn't complete the game yet with all emeralds but we have saved in Oil Ocean Zone and we have three emeralds to go...here's hoping we can get them haha
659 2018-02-17 22:05:06 That action came *during* the cold war but was related to the threat of nationalization of oil company property. And the rape of the Philippines came long before the cold war. All of our evil isn't due to the struggle against the USSR.
660 2018-02-17 22:05:05 Oil
661 2018-02-17 22:04:49 Trump blaming mental illness for shootings is insulting. That is a misdirection. The US is into guns, pharma and oil, the three biggest most profitable industries. And they don't care who dies as long as money comes their way. Fuck US gun laws.
662 2018-02-17 22:04:49 Me, water, biotin, and castor oil are about to be best friends, hunty.
663 2018-02-17 22:04:13 "I have a lot of things I want to say but it's best to 'just do it' in this case. Saves a 'history' lesson." Grabbing the oil.
664 2018-02-17 22:04:11 Por supuesto, tener foso y mantenerlo mientras crece implica acercarte a un monopolio.

El éxito del capitalismo puro implicaría su propia destrucción pues el mercado se queda con una sola empresa.
Véase Standard Oil.
665 2018-02-17 22:03:49 i cant believe people actually put coconut oil on their face like as a moisturizer
666 2018-02-17 22:03:46 You darn well know if there was Oil in Ontario or Quebec, none of this would be happening!!!!  if the BC can thwart the constitution then so can we.
667 2018-02-17 22:03:38 Alex gets his oil changed for $9.99...
668 2018-02-17 22:03:31 my suitemate dropped our glass olive oil container so now the kitchen is covered in glass and oil this is like the final boss of all the messes we have made and had to clean up

673 2018-02-17 22:02:22 they use each others, AlQaeda is Turkey, Turkey inside NATO with USA. USA work with Israel & KSA they fight Syria (Assadists) because they're with Russia & Iran. They want to take oil & gas ressources of Syria to get power on the region. But Turkey, KSA won't be 4 Israel no more
674 2018-02-17 22:02:15 True, but for some reason he didn’t enact the sanctions that Congress voted through. We still don’t know if Flynn was speaking for Trump when he told Kiskyak not to react to Obama’s sanctions. & there are negative ramifications for our budget deficits & possible oil spills.
675 2018-02-17 22:01:57 The oil needs to be hot enough but not too hot that the chicken burns without being cooked thoroughly. It's a science.
676 2018-02-17 22:01:42 Yes, it needs to look like motor oil for me.
677 2018-02-17 22:01:39 That’s all I’ve been asking for. I’ve been at Walmart for 3 hours now bc I got an oil change and the servers went down so now they holding my keys till I pay. GIVE ME A TIME.
678 2018-02-17 22:01:22 Jamaican Black Castor Oil truly changed my life....
679 2018-02-17 22:01:18 Every man, deep in his soul, wonders if he has what it takes to work on an oil rig.
680 2018-02-17 22:01:10 2 hours to kill while my oil gets changed and only home depot to get me through. 
681 2018-02-17 22:01:09 Yes I don't doubt that.  As are the standards for remediation of oil wells.  Is this one of the reasons companies walk away from their obligations and stick the taxpayer with paying for the clean-up?
682 2018-02-17 22:00:51 np way they can trade Griffin to.the oil.again.. can they?
683 2018-02-17 22:00:31 @jiffylube stopped by Service Center # 2765.says it closes at 5pm. I arrived at 4:30 How long does it take to do an oil change? But they couldn't be bothered to do one more because I was turned away. I guess if Jiffy Lube doesn't want my business I'll take it to someone else.
684 2018-02-17 22:00:26 She don use fast track oil for you bro. Wake up
685 2018-02-17 22:00:23 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
686 2018-02-17 22:00:19 February 17, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
687 2018-02-17 22:00:10 Anyone that calls “oil sands” “tar sands” is a moron as tar is a product of oil sands.Sorry Suzuki but it is what it is...
688 2018-02-17 22:00:03 I was an only with a sense of oil and gas prices or food prices or the health insurance costs. -Dan Quayle
689 2018-02-17 21:59:46 Just need some oil and Gulf donors. Won't be paradise but it'll the people's to build and govern. 

The Russian/Iranian/Baathist side can't be defeated but it can and must be contained.
690 2018-02-17 21:59:46 So, 88 Billion Dollars are needed for reconstruction in Iraq which was destroyed by the US and the U.K. The US is giving 3$BN to help American firms to invest in ruined Iraq. It will take years to clear the rubble. Iraqis kiss goodbye to your oil!!
691 2018-02-17 21:59:40 At least if oil weirds you out a clove isn’t like you’re putting something into her ear. It will fall out as she sleeps of course but it works to help with discomfort. I know oil heals/kills the infection. But Cloves do cure yeast infections, there’s some TMI for you 
692 2018-02-17 21:59:40 Amazingly, some will refute science and history and spout ignorance about bitumen. Big oil lobby are masters of misinformation.
693 2018-02-17 21:59:23 Nothing like an Oil vs. Coyotes afternoon tilt in mid February to get you jacked up
694 2018-02-17 21:59:16 Such a bizarre situation that defies logic. Customers resorting to illegal oil by necessity?
695 2018-02-17 21:58:48 Oil inna mi back
696 2018-02-17 21:58:46 Actually, Bitumen cannot be cleaned up. it forms oil blobs and sinks. if tar sands oil spilled off the coast of BC it woukld be a repeat of #ExxonValez only on a larger scale. I am against #KinderMorgan. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #StopKinderMorgan
697 2018-02-17 21:58:38 Hard to believe but if Rivet wins today, it would be their first trip specifically to Bankers Life Fieldhouse. They've been in multiple state finals, but they were at Lucas Oil Stadium, Allen County War Memorial Coliseum, and the Hulman Center.
698 2018-02-17 21:58:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
699 2018-02-17 21:58:27 I hate getting oil changes and doing car maintenance, it makes me not want to have a car... I literally hate mechanics shops
700 2018-02-17 21:58:23 Dear oil pimps. Thank you for your support of the attack on nature both land and sea for the benefit of an industry that will soon be moribund, employ precious few locals, and cost more than a few public dollars, both here and in Alberta. Thanks for the ultimatum.
701 2018-02-17 21:58:22 People, the #Russians fought for Trump to get a US ban on Exxon drilling Russian oil lifted. That oil is worth a thousand billion dollars. The Russians do not give a crap about our democracy or taking over our government. It's all about money, a LOT of money.
#RussiaCollusion
702 2018-02-17 21:58:09 Why is that at #billpennytoyota an oil change takes over 2 hours with an appointment. Like what are they doing?
703 2018-02-17 21:58:06 Oil & Vinegar
704 2018-02-17 21:58:00 If i find a photo of how my hair looked before and now i'll show you. And it's really cheap cause i think we all have the olive oil in our house.
705 2018-02-17 21:57:42 Showed my mum a photo of Jack and she said he looks like "an oil painting" 

Thus proving that the phrase 'he's no oil painting' does have an opposite equivalent
706 2018-02-17 21:57:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
707 2018-02-17 21:57:29 I thought it was just the oil that couldn't score on those chances
708 2018-02-17 21:57:27 didn't know oil comes firing out when you bleed the line in the boiler so sat in right infront of it like a proper fanny and got drenched in oil, lovely xxx

711 2018-02-17 21:57:02 She is from Norway. Ever been their? It is a great culture and a proud people with a thriving economy thanks to the North Sea oil. Her opinion on guns in America is not relevant or worthy of consideration. Norway is Norway and America is America. Check their immigration numbers!
712 2018-02-17 21:56:51 Politicians bought out by the NRA?  Boy, that’s a lot of $!  You’d think the oil companies would’ve bought the influence, not little gun companies.

714 2018-02-17 21:56:39 Well put. But Mr. Kristol, the bridge to #Trumpland started with the rot & devolution of Bush’s GOP. Your thirst for war and oil killed millions. GOP will forever be tied to whatever treachery is revealed through Mueller. Might be time for a new party, with a new name.

716 2018-02-17 21:56:18 Sounds like needs some more oil up front to drive threw pocket better
717 2018-02-17 21:56:12 Oooo yes! Pick up my dry cleaning, change my bedsheets, do my laundry and shine my shoes as well. I also need my shirt ironed for this evening and go buy me a new tie. And since you're working on the car, get an oil change and a wash while you're at it.
718 2018-02-17 21:55:28 Both side of my chain are lubed, Its plenty of oil and it does travel across
719 2018-02-17 21:55:21 Did U miss annotation under photo #1 of 8? Not protesting cargo ships. Commenting on how they see clean up ability.
"Canada has shown an inability to quickly respond to & clean up even small oil spills, such as this 2016 leak from a bulk carrier in Vancouver's English Bay."
720 2018-02-17 21:55:06 My grandmother didn’t have electricity until she was a teen, used oil lamps, picked cotton and wore smashed berries for makeup. When I was a child we still used a wringer and agitator to wash clothes and a wash board. Today I summon things on a pocket computer... 100 years...
721 2018-02-17 21:54:54 Garlic sounds ridiculous but Ive use it w success. Bc oil could b dangerous- When she falls asleep, set a PEELED and gashed clove of garlic in her ear (big enough that it won’t fall into her ear but sits in opening.) Call me crazy but this works if you can’t use oil.
722 2018-02-17 21:54:50 Once a week use a coconut oil, honey and olive oil mask for about 2h and then wash them like you do always
723 2018-02-17 21:54:42 oh my favourite .. but i could break the acrylic curse and use it as close to oil as possible .. which is not the usual case
724 2018-02-17 21:54:19 Millwall and pretty are like oil and water.
725 2018-02-17 21:54:08 We should do a comic of beefcake dudes doing beefcake dude things. 

"We must save the world! But first we must take off our shirts and oil ourselves up."
726 2018-02-17 21:54:06 Weigh out ten liters of olive oil and whisk briskly.
727 2018-02-17 21:53:45 The pesto is easy. Use almonds and rocket or toasted pine nuts and basil. Blend your choice with garlic, parmesan, salt, pepper, olive oil.
728 2018-02-17 21:53:25 facetime me i made one with oil blotting sheets once
729 2018-02-17 21:53:24 Generations paying for it.Russians 5 SANCTIONS not imposed allowing them to get as much oil as they want. We The People must TAKE Our Countries Government Back before it's beyond repair. Back to following. Constitutional Law's. All people no matter who Follows the same laws.
730 2018-02-17 21:53:11 I am still on the flavour profile of brown/black mustard seeds. This mornings test will be flavours of raw vs toasted vs popped in oil.
731 2018-02-17 21:53:06 I guess the question would be what incentive you have to fuck over one particular type of oil
732 2018-02-17 21:52:32 Oil slick...

735 2018-02-17 21:52:05 I’ve honestly never paid this much before. I think this take 5 place just got me lol. But they did the oil change before i knew the price. I would’ve got in my car and left had i known

737 2018-02-17 21:51:51 68% of global primary energy is waste from oil, gas coal and nuclear. The only useful metrics are final demand and electricity, where solar is already at ~2% and increasing rapidly. Wind and solar are already ~7% of global electricity; will be 20-40% by 2040. Buckle up!
738 2018-02-17 21:51:35 why does george think he’s funny putting Olbas oil under my eye to make it sting and actually BLINDED me for a whole 2 minutes
739 2018-02-17 21:51:21 "If we can't build our pipeline so we can further to exploit the oil sands will jeopardize our ability to meet our climate targets." ahh... not seeing the logic there.

The EPA was worth protecting from becoming a subsidiary of oil and gas industries.

756 2018-02-17 21:46:59 I hate getting my oil changed just cause I have to wait so long
757 2018-02-17 21:46:41 the olive oil was a deep green and looked as though it had come from a vineyard of emeralds
758 2018-02-17 21:46:35 The smell of cooking oil and fried food makes me feel sick.
759 2018-02-17 21:46:23 You know your mindset about cooking is changing when you realize you’re out of coconut oil and it’s very upsetting to you.  
760 2018-02-17 21:45:51 People don’t trust politicians or regulators or your so called rich self interest cabinet. Your talking points of threatening people with unemployment and the loss of billions ofif big oil doesn’t profit says you have been bought!

764 2018-02-17 21:45:28 I'm thinking of giving #hockey up for Lent. I can still talk #Oilers because they're not playing real hockey right now. #Senators win today drops the #Oil into a tie for 3rd overall in the #FallinForDahlin sweepstakes. #Dahlin #Oil #BeMyDahlin #DahlinILoveYou
765 2018-02-17 21:45:17 I'm not 100% sure what you mean. I'm skeptical that this pattern would hold up if the WTI-Brent spread got really big for some reason. India and China will find ways to use shale oil if it's a lot cheaper.
766 2018-02-17 21:45:15 what is silk screen printing? Survival of the fittest
767 2018-02-17 21:45:11 Even though I have lived and worked in BC my entire life I would love nothing more than to see Alberta close the valve on the flow of oil into BC’s lower mainland refineries. Be a joy to watch gas prices soar upwards and listen to these ungrateful asshats whine the blues......

770 2018-02-17 21:44:51 Do you know of oil pulling helps with chronic sinusitus?
771 2018-02-17 21:44:41 Oh how pathetic. Caught looking the fool b/c no collusion. But still a fool b/c under Obama watch, who did 0 but give them our uranium. Trump doing more a/g Russia by making Europe independent on Russian oil.
772 2018-02-17 21:44:33 
773 2018-02-17 21:44:29 True. I have found oil doesn't smell as bad as it used to do, and it does yellow, but for me coverage is king!
774 2018-02-17 21:44:26 What do I purchase, some Jordan 3s and royal purple oil and spark plugs 
775 2018-02-17 21:44:06 Once again, Alberta Government, how about you go fuck yourselves? I don’t recall you trumpeting this “share-and-share-alike” message when oil prices were high. Good luck winning the media battle on this one.
776 2018-02-17 21:44:05 Lol. It's just cabbage cooked in oil on the stove instead of water. So it keeps a crunch to it instead of getting soft like it does when you cook it in water.
777 2018-02-17 21:43:53 Today's #smoothie:

779 2018-02-17 21:43:43 I wasn't aware that was even a thing. Hezbollah vs Israel over oil/gas? need to search around...

781 2018-02-17 21:43:15 Day 4, sugar cravings are really kicking in. I've got buckwheat, dessicated coconut, cinnamon, coconut oil "biscuits" in the oven. Let's see how these turn out 
782 2018-02-17 21:43:13 Cook with animal fats, butter, ghee, natural coconut oil and palm oil. Avoid vegetable and cooking oils which are extremely processed #tips
783 2018-02-17 21:43:04 Alllriigghhtt. It's almost like fried cabbage. You cook it in oil, a little butter and seasonings on the stove and it still retains a lot of that crunch like it has before you cook it.
784 2018-02-17 21:43:01 I’m sure you’re in LA rn already, but do some coconut oil pulling and it helps with pulling that infection out, it sucks bc it doesn’t taste well but you’ll feel better once you’ve done it a few times.
785 2018-02-17 21:42:45 those are just talking points. NRA gives a little money to all of them.  They are NOT the biggest donors.  Oil companies give a lot.  Do you want your gas taken away?  If FBI had done their job this one wouldn't have happened.  Pres Trump is going to get with GOV and Dist Atty
786 2018-02-17 21:42:39 Sure, I'll tell the BC Government not to jeopardize it if you compromise and not destroy our beautiful Province with your dirty, cancer causing, natural landscape destroying oil pipeline.  #keeptoyourside
787 2018-02-17 21:42:30 Doesn't the oil industry have bigger fish to fry?  They must be worried he'll run for president.
788 2018-02-17 21:42:28 Awesome! I bought coconut oil yesterday for the first time! I'll definitely try this.

790 2018-02-17 21:41:45 My entire passenger side is filled with clothes & the floorboard has 6 pairs of shoes. So the guy that took my truck for an oil change just asked if I lived in there? No it’s just the rodeo tonight and I’m undecided on my outfit, sorry sir (,:
791 2018-02-17 21:41:42 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

794 2018-02-17 21:41:14 Grew up on the Gulf of Mexico...my first childhood memory of a family vacation is of a beach trip to Galveston right after an oil spill. I lived in New Orleans and remember the hazy sky during Jazz Fest a few days after Deepwater Horizon.  The Gulf has been plundered enough.
795 2018-02-17 21:41:10 I love the smell of sunblock and tanning oil

798 2018-02-17 21:40:54 I remember 4yrs ago how I was all about sweet potato fries and always got them if it was an option.

I can’t keep living a lie anymore, I actually don’t like sweet potatoes and now I just outright refuse to eat them. I JUST PREFER REGULAR BLAND POTATOES smothered in oil and salt
799 2018-02-17 21:40:53 I Like olive oil #OperationOliveBranch
800 2018-02-17 21:40:34 The funny thing is that i believed it so much that other kids believed me. I should have gone into the snake oil business, apparently - I could've made a killing! :p

804 2018-02-17 21:40:04 I would try coconut oil!
805 2018-02-17 21:40:00 I took my car to the tech shop to get an oil change and one guy said I blew a head gasket but really he just didn’t know what he was talking about. I was like “youre shitting me rn” 
806 2018-02-17 21:39:58 Or just those members who don’t want to explain how they weren’t able to stop this kid, despite warnings from the public.
807 2018-02-17 21:39:46 For temp pain relief, rub clove oil onthe area.  You prob have abscess if the pain gets worse or continues, so u need antibiotics. Had this like 2 weeks ago, went mad
808 2018-02-17 21:39:38 Saying no to pipelines is like cheering yes to rail and foreign oil.  Those are the direct consequences.

Get your pompoms out
809 2018-02-17 21:39:37 ANDY: That's oil right.
ME: It tastes margarineally butter
...

811 2018-02-17 21:39:15 @Lupita_Nyongo can you drop your skin routine? Do you use plain raw Shea butter or you mix it with vitamin E oil? I need my skin to look like I’m from Wakanda by June.

815 2018-02-17 21:38:40 More steel wool and more oil...
816 2018-02-17 21:38:19 My only worry is that it’d either get clogged (gross)
Or someone gets sprayed with the oil and they happen to be allergic to it o.O
It can be fairly limiting.
817 2018-02-17 21:38:09 Sure they wanted Trump which why theupushed Bernie also..wait...no...Stein? Sigh...RUS wanted a weakened HC. They didn't want T to win.  T for tracking which lowered oil prices which HURTS RUS while HC is anti-fracking which HELPS RUS with higher oil prices..aka more $ for Putin
818 2018-02-17 21:37:56 4 guys in here, all waiting on an oil change, all watching HGTV quietly. :)
819 2018-02-17 21:37:32 It’s over. It’s too late to build pipelines or refineries. It’s too late to take the oil profits to create a fund to use to diversify your economy. There will be no pipeline through BC so what’s your Plan B?
820 2018-02-17 21:37:01 I feel like a real adult today ...went to get my oil change and didn’t have to call my dad to see if I was getting the right one ...the little things.
821 2018-02-17 21:36:42 My dad and my stepmom just bought a $700,000 home with a bunch of acreage and Right now they are currently in Disney World but will get mad if I ask them to help me out and pay for my oil change. If that don’t tell you anything I don’t know what else does
822 2018-02-17 21:36:37 As it clearly states in the article the memo is related to the oil sector. It is the reporter who conflates "Canada’s energy industry" with "pipelines and oil exports".

825 2018-02-17 21:35:49 BC produces 4.5 Bcf/d of natural gas and exports it to Alberta and the US. There is a refinery in the lower mainland to produce gasoline from Alberta oil, which you could shut off in theory but it would contribute to oversupply. You need to get more product out, not less.

833 2018-02-17 21:34:55 Correct though very few things come from only one country if any at all, but like what we've done with oil we would likely invade that country and never learn anything
834 2018-02-17 21:34:44 Spilled some salad dressing on your shirt at dinner? Apply artificial sweetener to the area. It will absorb the oil, making washing easier once you get home. @RealSimple

836 2018-02-17 21:34:36 For the oil disaster; the fund manager however this is not a time to shift blames but to put measures in place to avoid a repetition. Shifting blames atimes blur clarity. The objective of the message should not be polarized on the side of politics.
837 2018-02-17 21:34:35 U wanna start digging for oil round Diss , you would need some . I hope you can back up ur words. I personally think there’s nothing in the pipeline. Most the players u sign won’t get in ang comb prem top 5 teams.

I mean, on my way to Bakau, I heard @constantdanny's voice coming so loud from a radio placed in this petrol station, I was like waw this is strange hna Africel nyor sponsor station bi. On the whole its "Africel Gas and Oil, Bakau!"
853 2018-02-17 21:32:41 The theme for today’s game is who can tweet the funniest jk without being to harsh,I still like this one “can u here that circus music” oh oil is playing nvmd
854 2018-02-17 21:32:38 4 Goals or not Id take Max Domi on the #oil anytime ............
855 2018-02-17 21:32:36 This after coming in 10th place. Imagine if he medaled!
856 2018-02-17 21:32:35 Pull the plug on Israeli oil
857 2018-02-17 21:32:31 تو یه "تهران" شنیدی فکر کردی خیلی دیگه حالیته؟ 

They're burning down the Saudi Embassy, you see that? Now, what that is is Iran wants to take over Saudi Arabia. They always have. They want the oil, OK?

داره درباره ماجرای سفارت عربستان توی تهران میگه !
همیشه اینطوری هستی؟
858 2018-02-17 21:32:30 Petrochina been buying LTO and selling to Venezuela. Well swapping it for fuel oil and Merey.
859 2018-02-17 21:32:09 Pak's Natural resource policies have made no major progress since the 2002 policy review (which was highly diluted)..
In Oil/Gas,Pak is among the worst countries with "existing & identified" latent potential..
Every Gov chases rent-seeking(commission) agreements for import

861 2018-02-17 21:31:52 Many thanks - spent some time formulating omega-3 oils (marine sourced EPA' DHA) & working on anti-oxidants: - a sunflower seed is stable long-term - the oil not so... Yet AOX - refined from seed- is sold back to formulators for shelf-life stability.... Will read with interest!

863 2018-02-17 21:31:41 Need a boy who will appreciate my essential oil collection
864 2018-02-17 21:31:40 So u teach cookery, yet u have no idea which oils are healthy and which aren’t. Would you let people choose sunflower oil? Know anything about importance of ratio between omega 6 and omega 3? No , u can’t just say oil.
865 2018-02-17 21:31:29 bon je test bi oil pcq les cicatrice de shtar ca va 2min hein

869 2018-02-17 21:31:08 To all the politicians, donors, or don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
870 2018-02-17 21:30:58 Tut..always pre-prepared here. Remember my ma doing the hit oil thing. They were probably nicer to be honest
871 2018-02-17 21:30:44 IT is not olive oil IT is honey form konya #OperationOliveBranch
872 2018-02-17 21:30:28 Training teachers to be cops is the same dumbass line of thinking that the Armageddon producers had when they said “hey, let’s train oil workers to be astronauts instead of teaching real damn astronauts to use a damn drill.”
873 2018-02-17 21:30:16 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
874 2018-02-17 21:30:03 I also oil them regularly, so that they’re shiny.

877 2018-02-17 21:29:49 Would it not be more relevant to question why Norway has a $900bn social fund, and the UK - whose territorial  waters also yielded gas and oil - has fuck all ?

882 2018-02-17 21:29:22 Gee, all those states voted for Trump in 2016 and they get a piece of that oil action.  What a coincidence...
883 2018-02-17 21:29:10 Olives ruin everything they touch, unless they are pressed into oil, then they rule. But actual olives are just wrong!
884 2018-02-17 21:29:02 The group of people most affected by Climate Change are our farmers. The biggest Climate Change deniers are the Nats in the name of Big Coal and Oil.
885 2018-02-17 21:28:46 USA sanctioned Russia in 2014 targeting oil and gas, country's main economic contributor besides stopping oligarchs from enjoying profits from their investments in N York, London and Riviera, citing Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity or Euromaidan leading to annexation of Crimea.

887 2018-02-17 21:28:12 No comments from big oil please.  Go work on pumping more carbon.
888 2018-02-17 21:28:00 Yes. They did. Fortunately I had amazing parents.
Dad never allowed us to play that shit. He never allowed mom to just cock, serve and clean.
She taught us...and we did it.
She also changed oil while we boys did housework.
Dad was always far ahead of his time. I still miss him.
889 2018-02-17 21:27:55 Refine it.    Make some money for the Provence. I'd be. More worried about the coming big one then oil.  Earthquake that is.
890 2018-02-17 21:27:51 What would it take from Oil do you think
891 2018-02-17 21:27:42 True mate, it might be quick as in drying an all that...but just ain’t got the guts to last or be more durable as oil..there I said it..especially on exteriors.
892 2018-02-17 21:27:29 Chuck Norris once had an erection while lying face down and struck oil.
893 2018-02-17 21:27:28 一成が士郎を手放しに褒めてるとこを見て「わかってねぇな！コイツはお前の理想とする善人じゃない。良心を勘違いした化け物だ！」って腹の中で思いながら自分だけが気づいてることに優越感抱いてて欲しいですね
894 2018-02-17 21:27:16 Why are there so many people here with wooden furniture? I know Pledge is great for cleaning but there's linseed oil too!  I'll see myself out. 
895 2018-02-17 21:27:16 Touch me niggas sliding like they running on oil..
896 2018-02-17 21:27:15 Typical ndp, free this free that, not a mention how any of this would be financed, against trade, oil everything that keeps this economy going, won't they get a surprise if Trump decides to pull out of NAFTA and dosnt take out oil
897 2018-02-17 21:27:06 Oil being traded in dollars, the loss of Scottish oil to the UK would cause a devaluation of the pound, probably to below a dollar. That’s the real issue, not so much what the oil is worth per se.
898 2018-02-17 21:26:55 هذه اللي صورت واللي تجري نفذو بجلدهم وكتب لهم ربي الكريم عمر جديد... هذا إرهاب أطفالهم ناس قلوبها خاويه من دين واحساس وإيمان مابعد الكفر ذنب
899 2018-02-17 21:26:48 I mean, remember when Hall and Ebs first dressed for Oil? Gave veteran, defensively responsible centre to mentor (Horc), and KEPT them there. Both players turned out great. Yak? 4th line, "learn to check, boy". Brutal asset management.
900 2018-02-17 21:26:42 If you got result by using that "anointing oil", then the credit is attributed to that oil not to God.
901 2018-02-17 21:26:31 @qikipedia "in turkish oil wrestling it's against the rules to grab his testicles or invade his rectum" so a friendly dick grab is allowed as long as you dont get a ball in there haha
902 2018-02-17 21:25:56 oil changed, new windshield wipers, new fuses 
903 2018-02-17 21:25:44 idk but i just bought a face mask and an oil for 120$ how tf do they cost this much 
904 2018-02-17 21:25:43 Is that like oil? Im using that urban decay power burnt doesn’t stay on x
905 2018-02-17 21:25:35 Support dirty oil? Are you insane. The problem with Alberta is the only thing they got to sell is oil. Try something different. 
906 2018-02-17 21:25:28 The enviros are incredibly naive.  Look around you all the things we use involve oil and natural gas as a primary component or consume it to produce the products we enjoy.  BC is firing on all cylinders as a result of cheap energy
907 2018-02-17 21:25:20 #houston Crude prices rose along
with the rig count, but oil companies
continued to lose money. -houston.org
908 2018-02-17 21:25:05 The pacific coast sees about 15% of Canadian oil traffic. The Atlantic cost sees 85% of tanker traffic. So they don't care about their coastlines? They don't care about jobs? Or is it that they have looked at relative risk vs benefit?
909 2018-02-17 21:25:01 @Vango on the Isle of #Skye last year discovered a liberal coat of olive oil meant midgies got stuck to you-didn't then bother others-honest
910 2018-02-17 21:24:59 Oh my god!  Did he drive in a car powered by big oil as well?
911 2018-02-17 21:24:58 Get real!  Raising Gross Production taxes will result in less drilling and fewer jobs in Oklahoma.  We will pay other states for oil to produce our gas and diesel.  Lose-lose! @FreedomWorks @AFPhq @okgov @officialOKGOP @GovMaryFallin
912 2018-02-17 21:24:49 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
913 2018-02-17 21:24:49 As much as oil would make life easier in a few areas, I think the downsides are greater!
914 2018-02-17 21:24:45 Because trump called on his hitman putin to help. Trump has an army of russians gangs n bots defending him. Why would he mess that up with sanctions. Prob has investments in russias oil deals. Follow the money.
915 2018-02-17 21:24:42 I part stormflower 1 part coconut oil and 2 parts Jessi 
916 2018-02-17 21:24:40 Watch out for knockoffs such as Bitcoin Cash as well. This is akin to selling someone a knockoff purse.  When you buy them, you are counting on the success of snake oil salesmen to steal a brand name using dishonesty, fraudulent media accounts, etc..  Bitcoin is BTC, not BCH
917 2018-02-17 21:24:36 Funny how the @albertateachers paid Suzuki to give an anti oil sands talk.  How about pulling oil-gas royalty money from their salary and pensions starting Monday morning.  They can go hat and hand to public for shortfall @CBCEyeopener
918 2018-02-17 21:24:34 You'd think he was opening a 10 minute oil change...
919 2018-02-17 21:24:27 Been stuck at Walmart for over 2 hours waiting for the shit to be fixed so I can pay for my oil change and shit and get outta here.
920 2018-02-17 21:24:22 39 others
I was asking you why they were studying it if it was purely snake oil! Not attempting to construct a straw man.
921 2018-02-17 21:24:19 Corey gardener has also allowed the oil industry to fakk the hell out of the state.
922 2018-02-17 21:24:13 Sounds like they were going for imminent domain to be used by oil companies
923 2018-02-17 21:24:09 Do you take a fish or krill oil supplement? This morning on House of Wellness we speak to Dr Bill Harris - a world expert on omega-3 oils who will explain the benefits. That's at 9am AEDT across Australia!
924 2018-02-17 21:24:01 @FadaunsiAdeniyi Meanwhile someone in London is busy applying oil on his hair and holding up play.
925 2018-02-17 21:23:58 Won't be enough from Oil.
926 2018-02-17 21:23:57 Life as bobby: 
Goes to dealership to get an oil change. 
Leaves with a new truck 
927 2018-02-17 21:23:39 While I'm here chatting shit: i reckon a good marketing tagline for cod liver oil would be 'Cod Liver Us From Evil'
928 2018-02-17 21:23:25 Got an oil change today, I feel so accomplished
929 2018-02-17 21:23:22 Meanwhile, there's a nationwide rebuke of your party. 

You've sold your souls to the oil and gun lobby. The piper will come calling in November.
930 2018-02-17 21:23:16 You can also put the samphire into a baking dish, drizzle on a little olive oil, and then place the whole fish of your choice on top and roast in the oven. (Should you have a whole fish to hand.)
931 2018-02-17 21:22:57 it costs far more to recycle certain plastics than to make from new oil at current prices.
932 2018-02-17 21:22:55 Something could be arranged  bitch they smell of each stormflower (and a hint of coconut oil) so of course they do 
933 2018-02-17 21:21:46 When these kids can vote they won’t put up with NRA/Big Oil/Old White Men nonsense. They’ll vote
Income equality 
Racial/gender inclusion
Public Education
NO wall 
Net neutrality
Assault weapon ban
Environmental protection
Universal healthcare 
People > Profits
I can’t wait.
934 2018-02-17 21:21:46 I was told 3-4 hours by a rep on the phone about 30 mins ago. Looks like I’ll be sitting at this Walmart they are holding my keys hostage until then since they changed my oil and I can’t pay them. Been here for over 2 hours.. I’m gonna need something for this inconvenience
935 2018-02-17 21:21:15 If you read this guy's tweets, it is obvious he is not a reporter but a pundit. His vitriol for the POTUS is palpable.
936 2018-02-17 21:21:11 Riding home from class, we pass this slow driving girl in the fast lane that looked like olive oil from Popeye

Dad: "dippy ass olive oil lookin bitch"

I fuckin died.
937 2018-02-17 21:21:07 They know that the oil landed on the Gulf floor and is still there
938 2018-02-17 21:21:04 Are kidding me? Your kidding right? A conservative mouth piece who has never actually done anything but be a whore for big oil and corporate America by insulting people is going cry about being called out? #hypocriteconservative
939 2018-02-17 21:21:03 Maybe if you tweet a pic at her of a pan lubed up in some sensual canola oil she’ll slide in your DMs for a three way.
940 2018-02-17 21:20:19 A million dollars dream with a 2 dollar work ethic goes together like oil and water. . . They just don’t mix
941 2018-02-17 21:20:06 Just got a message.  I need to take a shower to wash off the oil and the creepy guy masseuse.
942 2018-02-17 21:19:59 We must reject and eject it by all means or else we bury the oil.This resource must benefit Turkana people.
943 2018-02-17 21:19:57 If you defend Putin, you are also defending the:

Theft of billions by oligarchs from working citizens
Oil industry
Murder of journalists
Murder of political dissidents
Invasion of sovereign nations
Jailing of LGBT citizens
Subjugation of women
Subjugation of POC

944 2018-02-17 21:19:53 replace "sketches" with "masterful oil paintings"
945 2018-02-17 21:19:46 u can always drown me in links, whatever it is, if its about oil&gas safety and i am able to understand it, i'll collect it on my blog.
946 2018-02-17 21:19:45 In 2014 USA sanction Russia targeting oil & gas country's major economic contributor. Ukraine suffered Euromaidan in 2014 unable to forge ties with EU get funds for liberalising reform. Though Russia intervened with multi billion loan fight spilled to Crimea causing annexation.
947 2018-02-17 21:19:42 True, I have not seen it. I have seen the Jimmy Fallon clip, and read an account referring to you joking about “rubbing peanut oil” on yourself.  Given the similarity to Dan’s tweet (liked by you) I didn’t think it was much of a logical leap
948 2018-02-17 21:19:31 First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. 
First President to require all Americans to purchase a product from a third party. 

First President to go on multiple "global apology tours" and concurrent "insult us"
949 2018-02-17 21:19:26 Lmao only cus I take lil oil blotting sheets and I'm all using them during the show but my hair Forsure usually gets all crazy it gets tangled so easily like as soon as it's exposed to the outside air lol
950 2018-02-17 21:19:23 This is completely unacceptable. I was told 3-4 hours by a rep on the phone about 30 mins ago. Looks like I’ll be sitting at this Walmart when th then holding my keys hostage until then since they changed my oil and I can’t pay them. Been here for over 2 hours.. Fuck me right
951 2018-02-17 21:19:17 いやぁ慎二視点で見たら士郎はメチャクチャ裏表がない善人過ぎてムカつくだろうなー！
慎二視点の醍醐味は士郎への煮込まれまくったオブセッションだと思います
952 2018-02-17 21:19:14 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
953 2018-02-17 21:19:14 Scary? Confusing? Weird? Cool? Not a big deal? I live in the UK so that doesn't happen to us (closest thing to an earthquake for me was when an oil refinery near me exploded and shook the whole house)
954 2018-02-17 21:19:08 Jojoba oil is actually a pretty great carrier oil.
955 2018-02-17 21:19:05 Iran deepens freight discount to boost oil sales to Robbie Savage sources
956 2018-02-17 21:18:28 Their God = Gold, Oil and Drugs

958 2018-02-17 21:17:56 In need of 5 gallon heating oil jugs
959 2018-02-17 21:17:55 There aren’t enough words for how much I hate Rippon. He’s every bad gay stereotype rolled into one. Saudi Arabia and other nations see him at the Olympics and it reaffirms their anti-gay positions.
960 2018-02-17 21:17:27 Dyno room =/= race track.  Unless they are pelting the engine with dirt, grime, and oil vapor, putting the engine through wild lateral g swings, temperature changes, simulating bumps, jolts, etc, the dyno is little more than a calibration tool.
961 2018-02-17 21:17:18 similarly, the soviet union might have been able to weather the stresses of the afghan war much better if oil prices did not collapse in the 1980s
962 2018-02-17 21:17:15 @Squallmuzza half way through cooking: I should really put some Pasta in the pan.   Apparently our house special is now fried oil and hot water!
963 2018-02-17 21:17:07 I myself work in the industry and I have worked in several oil fields around the globe and I do see the huge differences in environmental responsibility companies here take compared to else where. I can see why Kenney tries to guard it so hard.
964 2018-02-17 21:17:00 Even in the health food store

Every other ingredient is a vegetable oil

And at the bottom it’s always the same

965 2018-02-17 21:16:59 My dad changed my oil and got me new windshield wipers. He the bestest 
966 2018-02-17 21:16:56 Looks like your partner is getting all the attention.  You better oil up
967 2018-02-17 21:16:29 Wait do y'all have beard oil?? @simonefiasco
968 2018-02-17 21:16:17 but again your analysis fails to take into account soviet adventurism in the 1970s (+ subsidies to cuba) probably would not have been possible without the oil prices
969 2018-02-17 21:16:13 Time to change guitar strings and oil my neck! 
970 2018-02-17 21:16:04 I just had an expensive oil change today. It was overdue though.
971 2018-02-17 21:15:53 $75 For A Oil Change Lol They Acting Like I Got 100.000 Miles On This Mfer Lol Only 49,000
972 2018-02-17 21:15:52 I soak my hand I warm water every morning and rub it with Johnson baby oil every day making it soft and tender... 

When and where shld I resume.
973 2018-02-17 21:15:49 Op de fiets noar Bèk?
974 2018-02-17 21:15:41 Q also mentioned House of Orange
Queen Beatrix of the House of Orange is largest share holder in Shell Oil
Also these royals in this area there is stories of child sacrifices,( illuminati?)
Could this also have to do with Q mentioning Watch the water?
975 2018-02-17 21:15:40 I’m not seeing any of these ratty foreign freighters that you refer to, even though I look out at freighters every single day...and none of these freighters are oil tankers filled with bitumen.
976 2018-02-17 21:15:35 そこで宿命を覆せなかった時点で主人公にはなれなかったのかもしれないですが、フラットな視点で見ると僕は士郎よりも慎二の物語の方に興味が湧きますね…
977 2018-02-17 21:15:35 OMG IS THAT PEPPERS IN OIL YOU GUYS
978 2018-02-17 21:15:26 Lil coconut oil around the cuticles
979 2018-02-17 21:15:12 NOO like the majority of chinese food i cant eat so like ive just never had it bc like at least at the restaurants my family goes to they usually cook the majority food in peanut oil and im allergic HSJDJ
980 2018-02-17 21:15:01 Selling offshore oil leases in March, the house GOP voted down DEM bill letting towns protect their folks from fracking-(brag abt your legislation 2 Putin’s NRA-they appreciate your work on their behalf)
981 2018-02-17 21:14:53 Thank you! That’s exactly what I’m gunna do especially because i know the oil now, just gotta learn the filter
982 2018-02-17 21:14:51 I put James in the Tim Ferriss camp - fairly smart and insightful dood who I'd respect a lot more if he dropped the snake oil marketing act.
983 2018-02-17 21:14:32 Yooo if you’re drinking IPA or any beer that looks like motor oil do yourself and everyone at the bar a favor and don’t speak to them. Your breath smells like a million assholes
984 2018-02-17 21:14:27 I love kale and I actually cut it up large with sea salt and a bit of olive oil and put in oven for 10 minutes.  Quick kale chips...
985 2018-02-17 21:14:23 oil
986 2018-02-17 21:14:16 I was told 3-4 hours by a rep on the phone about 30 mins ago.

I’m gonna need something for this inconvenience
987 2018-02-17 21:14:14 Better then the PM that is for sure. Your not selling snake oil. 
988 2018-02-17 21:14:12 nope. none of them will do shit, as always.
All they need to do is cut off Israel's oil supply and peace would come about overnight..
too busy trying to be americans right now, it seems..
989 2018-02-17 21:14:06 @BraveTart quick question re: white mountain cake- can I replace the virgin coconut oil with refined coconut oil to eliminate coconut flavor?

994 2018-02-17 21:13:13 Yes let’s expand medical coverage but like quick question @theJagmeetSingh ... how do we pay for it when you seem to be against bringing Alberta oil to market? Or responsible resource development period?

995 2018-02-17 21:13:07 A derivative is nothing else than an insurance - airlines buy huge amount of oil derivatives to have an insurance against rising oil prices. Farmers buy Soja derivatives to hedge against falling Soja prices. US companies exporting to Europe buy USD-EUR derivatives. Think about it

998 2018-02-17 21:12:30 try using coconut oil rather than hand cream. It's highly hidrating & has no harmful chemicals. & it smells good naturally!

1000 2018-02-17 21:12:03 I bought some Ritter Sport once when looking to spend some spare Euros. I'd never experienced greasy chocolate before, then when I looked at the ingredients and realised palm oil formed a part of the ingredients it made me think about deforestation. #livewithoutit
1001 2018-02-17 21:11:48 A dose of CBD oil before bed. Sleep like a log! :)
1002 2018-02-17 21:11:26 The only thing I've come away with is that he's a self-centered little snot.

1009 2018-02-17 21:10:08 I’m not saying I’m an oil painting but she’s what, in the past, he’d have referred to as “fugly”.
1010 2018-02-17 21:10:08 Oil don finally they the DJ head  make I dance  gan #BBNaija
1011 2018-02-17 21:10:07 Shale oil and the crash of the petrodollar is going to put an end to that.
1012 2018-02-17 21:09:58 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
1013 2018-02-17 21:09:56 I was supposed to do a walk through for this apartment & get my oil changed today... I’ve done neither.
1014 2018-02-17 21:09:54 A drop of garlic oil !
1015 2018-02-17 21:09:40 dark fang is a comic about an 18th-century vampire that emerged from underwater in the modern day to avenge the death of her best friend (a shark, killed by an oil spill off the american coast)
1016 2018-02-17 21:09:35 Oil blocks were compensation to prosecutors of the Biafran civil war that also protected the Niger Deltans From economic and political domination by the south easteners. Dickson should be thankful for once
1017 2018-02-17 21:09:30 no reduction!  only major reductions in carbon happened because of a recession! And mass closing of manufacturing plants, downsizing oil sands, etc   sorry to burst your bubble   Its called  'economics'   Now I'm sure you also believe Al Gore when he said it's tropical by now!
1018 2018-02-17 21:09:13 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1019 2018-02-17 21:09:11 my guess; huckabee-sanders got today off to bake one of her kids & steven miller's head was in the shop getting the tin lining replaced & the oil changed, so they gave sparky here a shot at the big time.  start him off at Faux News with some softball questions, see how he'd do.
1020 2018-02-17 21:09:09 Quandry. If in his “high level” meetings India says “send us your oil” what will junior do?
1021 2018-02-17 21:09:04 The fuckkkk you bring it in for lol oil change?
1022 2018-02-17 21:09:02 Oil change happening for the jeep. Yay adulthood.  I could be home playing some NBA 2K18 right now
1023 2018-02-17 21:08:10 So why do you hate teachers so much? Did you set your hair on fire when a guest speaker last year was a #climatechange denying Big Oil shill named Rex Murphy? #hypocrazy #AbLeg #HatersGonnaHate
1024 2018-02-17 21:08:05 As a pharmacist- the best thing you can do is warm up a little olive oil and put a few drops in her ear every 2-3 hours. It is/was marketed as Sweet Oil in the Pharmacy.

1026 2018-02-17 21:07:45 so relieved the lumps we discovered on Bella are non cancerous  and are most likely oil build up. 400$ later.

1029 2018-02-17 21:07:14 Go back to oil. You'll remember why it's better than waterbased. Then you'll think..... Why did I ever leave you....
1030 2018-02-17 21:06:22 If @RachelNotley really “wants progress in the Trans Mountain pipeline impasse”, her next step is exceedingly straightforward: #StopKM. Not just BC, but no one in the world wants Alberta’s toxic tar sands “oil”.
1031 2018-02-17 21:06:19 Oil would need to be transported from elsewhere to make up for lack of production from Canada. For Energy East @cathmckenna only considered emissions from Canadian industries and not the emissions by other countries that would be displaced. Killed Canadian industry. #canpoli
1032 2018-02-17 21:06:17 never again applying baby oil on my face for tanning what was i thinking lol
1033 2018-02-17 21:05:58 Put down that weapon - Midnight Oil

Put down that weapon or we'll all be gone
You can't hide nowhere with the torchlight on
And it happens to be an emergency
1034 2018-02-17 21:05:55 I don’t think BC or Quebec care.  This is the politics of resentment- “why do they have it easy and we have it so hard?”  Unfortunately oil is in demand and if we don’t use our own oil we are paying others for their oil.  Very shortsighted
1035 2018-02-17 21:05:29 Lol adulting...oil change, new windshield whipers, fixed muffler, rotated tires and now my gas tanks rusted through and leaking -_-
1036 2018-02-17 21:05:23 rose hip oil is the friend everyone needs!!! my skin’s holy grail
1037 2018-02-17 21:05:18 You do realize that Gulf Arab Media(Al Jazeera/AJ+) also advocate for open borders in the West right? You are more troubled by the Jews instead of the oil rich Muslims who sponsor terrorism.
1038 2018-02-17 21:05:15 I’m way to pleased with myself that I actually made it to the oil change place today
1039 2018-02-17 21:05:10 @BlairKing_ca Psst! Wanna hear a secret, from a marine oil spill expert at that?: We're nowhere near prepared for a catastrophic tanker casualty off the BC coast, and never will be. Just pray it doesn't happen.
1040 2018-02-17 21:05:07 Totalmente de acuerdo. Los hechos referidos al proceder de PPK estan claros y no resisten defensa alguna. Y no solo por lo de Odebrecht sino tambien por el caso Hunt Oil. Por lo tanto, su destino parece seguro: La Caida. El articulo en el El Comercio esta cargado de confusion.
1041 2018-02-17 21:04:56 On peppermint oil capsules to help my IBS. They’re doing a great job but the side effect is my skin turns bright red when I drink alcohol  (I’m not angry, that’s just what I look like)
1042 2018-02-17 21:04:53 Sorry, Don't know much about cars was never a gear head! I can change the oil,tires, and brakes. That's about the extent of my car knowledge.
1043 2018-02-17 21:04:38 The dude got bronze right?
1044 2018-02-17 21:04:33 OIL! My apologies sir.
1045 2018-02-17 21:04:29 I just found out you actually use baby oil on babies tf
1046 2018-02-17 21:04:24 Of filthy oil and gas will sadly be long gone Not seeing the devestation THEY CAUSED for worthless $$ You should be putting your energy into ways to protect your Planet otherwise there's NO Alternative one ( Fact) and This Administration doesn't care about you or anyone else FACT
1047 2018-02-17 21:04:20 Just finished up some midwinter vehicle maintenance for Mama Bear. For the first time, I had to jack up her SUV to drain the oil. Normally I can squeeze underneath the vehicle. Looks like my new chest routine at the gym is paying off! 
1048 2018-02-17 21:04:07 Oil lose 4-2
1049 2018-02-17 21:03:45 I've got watercolours, acrylics, pencils, pastels...and I've realised the only thing holding me back from being on a par with the Dutch masters is my lack of oil paints.
1050 2018-02-17 21:03:33 If your onions don't sound like screaming Mandrake when you pour it in oil on fire.. Can you even cook like this?
1051 2018-02-17 21:03:06 Holy shit. This happened to me yesterday. I got woken up at 8:30AM with the super pounding on my door and checking for smoke. I could smell cooking oil. I know exactly who it was, but they didn't speak up. They cook with the oil all the time, of course I know who they are. :P
1052 2018-02-17 21:02:58 Hmu for that oil
1053 2018-02-17 21:02:48 Ameen oo

1060 2018-02-17 21:01:51 The problems with the Venezuelan economy are not due to socialism, but to artificially low oil prices created by Saudi Arabia and sabotage in a calculated and coordinated move with America.
1061 2018-02-17 21:01:41 The RUB/USD kind of shows when oil is under/over priced?
1062 2018-02-17 21:01:28 sorry, yeah. put em in a baking tray, sprinkle olive oil and whatever seasoning you like on them, heat the oven to 400 and stick em in for 45-50 min and BOOM you got an awesome snack

1067 2018-02-17 21:00:42 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
1068 2018-02-17 21:00:42 Coconut oil really works for e v e r y thing
1069 2018-02-17 21:00:38 "As recently as 2008, the Republican platform mentioned climate change 13 times, saying it was caused by 'human economic activity' and committed to decreasing demand for oil. In 2012, the platform mentioned 'climate change' in scare quotes, only to disparage concern about it."
1070 2018-02-17 21:00:22 الله يسلمك تستاهلون
1071 2018-02-17 21:00:07 Maybe Alberta could stop jeopardizing everyone's future by figuring out a way to survive without exploiting oil resources that push us far past our carbon budget?
1072 2018-02-17 21:00:04 Ada kok. Adek gue pake ni*vea men whitening oil control, nah buat produk ini emang ada 2jenis yg facial scrub & foam. Yg scrub seminggu 2x aja sisanya pake foam.

1105 2018-02-17 20:53:41 Well, duh! Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau received an unusually warm reception of his keynote address at an energy industry conference in Texas on Thursday evening. "No country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them there," Trudeau said.
1106 2018-02-17 20:53:39 Mr. Kenney and others of his political ilk beatify the oil industry, wrap themselves in its aura, and expect everyone to worship at its feet. It's just ridiculous. Alberta is about more than oil.
1107 2018-02-17 20:53:35 McConnell disallowed addressing the problem. Bye, troll.
1108 2018-02-17 20:52:56 I've just never cared for it. Plus my Great Grams used to make me drink it after she gave me Castor Oil whenever I was sick.
1109 2018-02-17 20:52:53 Do you mean the feds or the province? And what about the private sector @MarineResponse role? And while the region is under-served in terms of spill response infrastructure, one reason for that is that oil shipments through the region are relatively small.
1110 2018-02-17 20:52:53 Use baby oil next time and cotton pad!!! They come off easy

1116 2018-02-17 20:52:20 OH is very cross about the bad sci fi science on The Cloverfield Project. 
“How have they solved gravity and not the oil crisis?”
1117 2018-02-17 20:52:11 Could it be... Tedediah, is that you? Living off the profits of a shady oil business no doubt
1118 2018-02-17 20:52:07 We should have the connections to be sure AB residents are firsts. BC says they don't need us, keep your oil. Well no more new BC startups in AB. and no oil from our Canadian owned pipeline right of way. And quit thinking you own the ocean.
1119 2018-02-17 20:52:03 I was trying to give Ellie a spa day and she kept drinking the dirty water and ate the coconut oil I was gonna rub on her paws

Easy enough to.find facts on Obama gratuitous enactment of reg.
1123 2018-02-17 20:51:38 But all the tankers along the BC coast transporting foreign oil is cool? Alright then.
1124 2018-02-17 20:51:28 Dear Andy, trust me Canadian's know you will always support big oil companies. It is supporting them above all else that is bothersome. Then toss in your alt-right ties, your Fundy principles you wish to force on Canadians is more than bothersome, it is frightening. #canpoli
1125 2018-02-17 20:51:24 I suspect they're fine with the current pace, they just don't want to create a crisis that prices oil out of reach of the broader market.  There s no stopping electrification, and OPEC is already strategically planning for this reality.

1137 2018-02-17 20:48:58 THERE'S PALM OIL IN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING, I'M SO DONE. WHY IS THAT SHIT IN EVERY SINGLE FOOD????
1138 2018-02-17 20:48:32 I haven’t even gotten an oil change yet but Monday morning I will be going .
1139 2018-02-17 20:48:19 What's your reaction to AB teachers paying tens of thousands and applauding Rex Murphy at one of their conferences while promoting his retrograde, science denying ideas to those influencing our children

You know, Rex Murphy, climate change denier and champion of big oil.

1140 2018-02-17 20:48:13 Just had such a Vancouver moment, walking past a Tesla with the license plate "OIL LOL".
1141 2018-02-17 20:48:00 Once again, the majority in the Lower Mainland oppose this pipeline. When PR passes with 52% support people like yourself will be marginalised. I would say Oil by Rail is finished as well!
1142 2018-02-17 20:47:50 New brakes and oil change on the sunfire. Done adulting, oh wait I need food too
1143 2018-02-17 20:47:09 The point is; that millions of people who work for or own BIG OIL have a vested interest in slowing down the proliferation of electric transportation on earth.

And the Saudis would like to keep oil price higher, making it easier to sell to the public.

1144 2018-02-17 20:46:58 Actually, much of what cows eat in the US is just the inedible crap left over from processing that produces your fake meat, soy and palm oil, gluten-free bread and so on.
1145 2018-02-17 20:46:32 Our ally Canada wants to send their oil down south to us. @realdonaldtrump is forcing Canada to send it west to China.
1146 2018-02-17 20:46:26 Hope you're walking the talk and have stopped using all  oil derivatives and insisting no gov revenue from oil be applied to education.
1147 2018-02-17 20:46:13 Good thing it wasn’t oil or condi.  Get that pipeline built!
1148 2018-02-17 20:46:10 She’s quitting and going to work in the oil industry.

1152 2018-02-17 20:45:43 I read online that people use coconut oil as a moisture so I just tired it and for the past 15mins I’ve just been slippy 
1153 2018-02-17 20:45:32 Jojoba oil! It’s not too oily either

1155 2018-02-17 20:45:20 Timing belts and water pumps. Also the oil pickup can get clogged so best to change it. And a remap changes the car so much.
1156 2018-02-17 20:45:18 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1157 2018-02-17 20:44:53 Kept it simple, and just rubbed it with a crapload of olive oil, and a garlic, herb and sea salt combo.  Smells ridiculously good already!
1158 2018-02-17 20:44:52 fr tho why dont we just take the oil rig design and repurpose it into like massive hydroelectric power stations that function off the waves
1159 2018-02-17 20:44:51 @FoodNetwork @FoodCookMag Why the hell does American cooks always use extra virgin olive oil? What the hell did they cook with before that crap became popular? Do we not have any real good old time cooks left in America?

1164 2018-02-17 20:44:01 I thought China ran out of oil decades ago. What’s their population compared too Canada? Maybe our targets should be measured on a per person credit! Only Chinese that actually live in Canada get Canadian credits of course.
1165 2018-02-17 20:44:00 Who's idea was it to combine Oil of Empires and Gallipoli for an operation campaign? It's so unenjoyable to play.
1166 2018-02-17 20:43:57 Was supposed to go get an oil change. But came to get my nails done instead 
1167 2018-02-17 20:43:57 Did you find it helped? I love Jasmine oil. Got some burning at the moment

1173 2018-02-17 20:43:13 Jet fuel? You honestly think the oil companies make a notable amount off jet fuel? Just to perpetuate a conspiracy? 

The airline industry is by far the biggest consmer of jet fuel. No expensive space conspiracy needed.

Have you thought any of this through?
1174 2018-02-17 20:43:06 Oil of all kinds! Oil all the time
1175 2018-02-17 20:43:04 Yes.  Debate and disagreement is healthy - yelling and filtering isn’t. Our Kids need to learn that things can be “grey” and nuanced.  Society owes much to oil and gas.  I’m sure there were a few cars in that parkade.
1176 2018-02-17 20:42:53 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.

1180 2018-02-17 20:42:24 Yeah They got 20% of our uranium from hillary and obama but the Russians wanted Trump who, from the beginning wanted strong military and America first agenda & wanted us to be energy independent & export oil (to Europe.) How in the hell would Putin want that
1181 2018-02-17 20:42:05 Yep but it's so tasty. The fries are done in peanut oil, and they give you a shit ton of fries
1182 2018-02-17 20:42:03 Hello, thank you for reaching out to us with your concerns. We use non-GMO, expeller pressed canola oil in our own kitchens; however, we do offer many dishes that do not contain it. A team member would be happy to recommend  dishes that are made without canola oil.
1183 2018-02-17 20:41:48 Kid bought the gun through the internet. The same way people of Florida buy THC oil. The NSA knows. The FBI knows. FBI was alerted about a youtube video but chose to ignore it. Government agencies didn’t do shit. Do you really think the problem is the access to something banned?
1184 2018-02-17 20:41:41 Why the hell does American cooks always use extra virgin olive oil? What the hell did they cook with before that crap became popular? Do we not have any real good old time cooks left in America?

1190 2018-02-17 20:40:57 All done right under the nose of Obama admin and Intel agencies.
1191 2018-02-17 20:40:57 Your right about "Cherry Picking" nailed it.
All of Big Government doesn't want the uniformed public to understand the horrific nature of these Countries.
Big Oil perfers us to lead a blind eye on social injustice.

1205 2018-02-17 20:38:58 Well, we don't have a well-educated citizenry. That's painfully obvious. It's also why people fall for the tsunami of Facebook ads for snake oil and scam products. My God, the ads on your platform are disgraceful.
1206 2018-02-17 20:38:52 relatable content is the best, just like my oil barron husband and our offshore sex rig

1209 2018-02-17 20:38:35 For the record, you're the one who brought up the topic of the 'Central Coast'. There has been an informal ban on crude oil transport there, as well as off the North Coast, since 1972. Thanks to the work of myself and others, that should soon become law, & will include DilBit.
1210 2018-02-17 20:38:03 Time to built a real economy. Stop relying on oil. China is moving to electric transit, rail and cars. There will be no market for it soon.
1211 2018-02-17 20:38:02 No, I’m familiar with it. Something to the effect of rubbing peanut oil on yourself to avoid being blamed for a fatal anaphylactic reaction. Hilarious.And coupled with his “natural selection” hashtag?  its the kind of comedic synergy not likely to be seen again in our lifetimes.
1212 2018-02-17 20:37:52 Oil change. Clean car. Clean house. Good day
1213 2018-02-17 20:37:36 yup... use your platform to righteously rail against less than 0.014% of the federal budget! Of course you are ignoring that the oil sector gets more than 10x that but I guess you agree with that expenditure?
1214 2018-02-17 20:37:31 A lot of LC baking involves almond flour. If one keeps the carbs low they can still be getting a lot of Omega 6 in relation to Omega 3. Would supplementing with fish oil to up their omega 3's be sufficient, or is there an upper limit of Omega 6 one also needs to watch out for?
1215 2018-02-17 20:37:23 If olive oil is made of olives...then...

1217 2018-02-17 20:37:09 Retard alert. Lol. Isn't Venezuela an oil producing country? The fact that after goodluck Jonathan and his gang of thieves nearly stole Nigeria to stupor and we are standing is a huge achievement by this government
1218 2018-02-17 20:36:46 May be no need for a war with the KSA as they are liberalising anyway. Shitting themselves about the end of the oil age no doubt.

1229 2018-02-17 20:35:17 The root problem prime example is Mexico
Mexico is the third-largest trading partner with the US
Mexico is in the top 4 countries exporting oil to the US
Why is Mexico a third world country with that kind of wealth?
Because of the governmental economic policies

Lumberton takes from 8 am to 4 pm to rotate 4 tires, repair one without giving me a new tire, and attempting an oil change without getting it done.  BAD!
1279 2018-02-17 20:26:53 The more I study this man who outwardly projects an image of “saving humanity, saving the planet”, the more I see a greedy, self-centred, egotistical, manipulative, fearmongering snake oil salesman.

1283 2018-02-17 20:26:01 Let me break this down in the simplest of terms. The #GOP is the party of big oil. Everyone knows this. Russia’s single most important industry is oil and gas hence the alignment of interests. It’s really not anymore complicated then that.
1284 2018-02-17 20:25:59 Also recommend using almond oil, that stuff makes my skin have a natural glow and not feel oily at all 
1285 2018-02-17 20:25:45 Swimming in some dirty pool of apathy. It's hard when you've got a lot to do but your mind fails to motivate your body to be productive. You just lay in your messy bed, reflecting on the past and what could have been. ... your spirit burning out of oil..
1286 2018-02-17 20:24:58 Dear @Walmart, you Lumberton, NJ store should just close their tire lube express.  They have no clue how to run one.  I’ve come to this store to get oil changes arriving 2 hours prior to close and they can’t get them done.
1287 2018-02-17 20:24:55 We have to get all money out of politics . This Country is run by the oligarchy from the NRA, Parma ,Big oil ,on and on
1288 2018-02-17 20:24:55 Im stuck at an oil change place too. So embarrassing. To show them my balance and have no way of getting it to them.
1289 2018-02-17 20:24:52 Probably overheated when the oil ran out. Potter Street to Epping would have been about the range limit for a Marina 
1290 2018-02-17 20:24:31 In west virginia they drug a woman away in handcuffs for outing politicians about how much money they accepted from big oil.  We no longer, or ever did,  live in a democracy. #nra #CorporateShills
1291 2018-02-17 20:24:30 Trudeau won't do anything to upset his tentative political hold in Quebec. He cancelled Energy East, a sensible plan to get Eastern Canada off of foreign oil- because Quebec raised a smidgen of opposition (compared to the opposition for the Transmountain pipeline, that is).

We know you prefer Russian or Venezuelan oil. Canada at 1.6% of world emissions should do more. CO2 is a fertilizer
1297 2018-02-17 20:23:38 Scotland gets more per head under the Barnett formula than Wales. Also gets extra from North Sea oil production. They are still not doing better economically than under Labour. In fact because of Austerity measures they are worse off
1298 2018-02-17 20:23:28 Or you know but don't care? Interesting you say you heard all that before the referendum yet you chose to believe the snake oil salesmen who said the EU was holding us back and that we could go around the world making trade deals and be rich beyond our wildest dreams.

1302 2018-02-17 20:22:38 I can't remember what comedian did this, but having politicians "wear" or disclose who gives them money, like NASCAR drivers jumpsuits! It would be NRA, and oil companies. Make them all disclose to the public during elections!!

1322 2018-02-17 20:19:01 Hey that’s great.  Unfortunately we do need oil, at least over the short to medium term.  And so if you aren’t getting the oil in Alberta, you are shipping it from further away, probably by barge or ship.  Alomst certainly in a more carbon intensive production method.

1415 2018-02-17 20:03:28 Communists had more impact in succeeding the khomeinist revolution than the mullahs themselves, USSR had many puppet groups even controlled khominists, but th ideology has long lost its influence, only the easy oil money is what keeps the mullahs in power but that's going to end.

1419 2018-02-17 20:02:53 I agree on the role of oil prices in US inflation => the rightward tilt in the USA + the crucial Volcker disinflation, from which (I have argued) so much of the subsequent history derives
1420 2018-02-17 20:02:40 Second batch of pancakes even better!! (This time we froze the batter for 10mins instead of chilling and fried in coconut oil, not sunflower.)

1448 2018-02-17 20:00:55 Do you have any idea the amount of work needed to change over to hydrogen based energy?

Besides that tech exists today and is inline with our scientific progress. Its just not deployed on a large scale. Mostly due to oil companies which dont involve space. 

You make no sense
1449 2018-02-17 20:00:52 The secret is coconut oil.
1450 2018-02-17 20:00:48 we used to get those here in this house when nan lived here, old windows back then and only the oil stove for heat.

1457 2018-02-17 20:00:02 Its about the oil the Russian want thats why tillerson is sec of state, and lying con man trump will get a piece of the action. Thats why he won't put the sanctions in effect.
1458 2018-02-17 19:59:53 Nothing better than the whole house smelling of olbas oil and vicks

1462 2018-02-17 19:59:13 Bargaining powers, so England would refuse all that water from Scotland, all the food & drink, power & just a wee drop of oil, sounds pretty good bargaining powers to me, but then again as you say I am no Corporate layer.

1469 2018-02-17 19:58:08 You guys live on government handouts. Government collects the money from oil royalties to pay you in the first place. Now you bring in a person who wants to shut down the very industry that pays you. . And you cry for funding.

1476 2018-02-17 19:57:20 such a shame that environmental protections & unchecked oil drilling fracking & development will destroy not only their habitat but many others.  Unfortunately not yours.

1493 2018-02-17 19:54:45 Canada will need to do even more,exactly what I m not sure, as USA drives the price per barrel of crude below $30! USA is weaponizing self sufficiency

And then there's the issue of deferred investment, important to consider with finite resources - produced later. 2/2
1511 2018-02-17 19:51:49 As for 'attacking Pearl Harbour for no reason', the US had placed an oil embargo on Japan leaving them facing an economic collapse. Japan felt it had little choice. There is more than one way to wage war.
1512 2018-02-17 19:51:46 you're wrong because the money gained from oil doesn't arrive to the venezuelan people, that money goes directly into the wallet of regime's members...

You simply choose to ignore that we own the largest chunk of oil in Europe same goes for fishing - even farmed fish.
Whisky, tourism, the list is long - you just choose to ignore it because it doesn't sit well with your agenda.
Then there's the Nordic option.

1548 2018-02-17 19:44:10 We do too, Wil. In fact, it is pork chops and rice night. Casey likes to park himself in front of the oven door while his chops are baking after, of course, being seared in olive oil. He has developed a very discerning palate since our son, Skyler, is a professional chef.
1549 2018-02-17 19:44:10 Pancakes & oil changes. What more could I ask for on a Saturday morning 
1550 2018-02-17 19:44:01 this coconut oil cream 
1551 2018-02-17 19:43:59 I am okay banning the sale of gas burning vehicles.
They are using the correct approach.
Stop the use of fossil fuels is the first step.
Norway are still producing oil and will still sell oil on the world market.

1552 2018-02-17 19:43:45 refinanced my loan, got my oil changed and my tires rotated, and also got a $433 refund from the dealership.. v productive Saturday :)
1553 2018-02-17 19:43:05 Fry oil helps so much here. #protip #arealprospro
1554 2018-02-17 19:42:58 @Andrew_Adonis So you would be happy for the EU to purloin Norh Sea oil the way they have grabbed our fishermen’s rights? The way this corrupt, elite EU club operates and threatens we may have no choice if we stay in the #EU prison.#Brexit
1555 2018-02-17 19:42:54 Yo for some reason today I woke up thinking about a conversation me and @xForever_Nae mom had a million times. I used to refuse to use Japanese cherry blossom lotion back in HS. She'd be like "AYE ZEE! STRIPPERS USE BABY OIL. NOT JAPANESE CHERRY BLOSSOM"
1556 2018-02-17 19:42:52 You are a fool. Children were killed in Florida & all you can talk about is oil. How about saying a prayer. You & your Leftists People caused this. You have no soul SenFeinstein. How does it feel now that you have been called out SenFeinstein.
1557 2018-02-17 19:42:38 Yep, been saying this about the Oil for 10+ years. Hemsky, Gagner, Hall, Ebs, Yak, Nuge all ruined by being forced into a losing culture. They're at risk of doing the same with McDavid and Drai as well. With HUGE contracts come HUGE expectations. Ebs nailed it in his interview.
1558 2018-02-17 19:42:36 Not to take anything away from pogba... bruv u are our oil. with u we can turn the flair ON! this is the HARD truth!
1559 2018-02-17 19:42:24 He was put there to relax regs for mines, oil, drilling, fracking and whatever horrors these earth killing f*cks can dream up. Coal is dead, there's no market, but there's money? Pruitt is on the case!
1560 2018-02-17 19:42:11 @TheLapsedFan Yesterday I saw an oil truck owned by a company called "JP Hogan." Brother....
1561 2018-02-17 19:42:07 Na wa oh. We fit use all that oil for Kloe hair fry plantain. tf?? #BBNaija
1562 2018-02-17 19:41:58 the saddest thing that happened to me in 2018 : mistaking a used e.l.f oil blotting sheet for a raw king sized paper when i was out of papers and looking for one desperately. other than that, everything has been lovely :)
1563 2018-02-17 19:41:46 Some info on oil pulling. Coconut oil is what I used.
1564 2018-02-17 19:41:45 Heard it was olive oil
1565 2018-02-17 19:41:29 That's not factory but yes the oil lines are going into where the cross bolts are for the main caps.
1566 2018-02-17 19:41:29 I been out here trying to bust a nut, and you tell me I gotta get my oil changed
1567 2018-02-17 19:41:22 It is pork chop and rice night for Casey. He usually parks himself in front of the oven where his chops are baking, of course after being seared in olive oil. He has developed a very discerning palate.
1568 2018-02-17 19:41:12 Shiek mansour would be crying oil rn eh?
1569 2018-02-17 19:41:09 Any organisation today is sitting on a pile of data. But there is no respite as there is a continuous pursuit of accumulating more and more data. There seems to be a data deluge, which has led to the creation of monikers like “data is the new oil” (which in itself is a misnomer)
1570 2018-02-17 19:41:02 The plant. I dub a little tea tree oil on the dark marks that are really stubborn
1571 2018-02-17 19:40:54 I do this with some cracked red pepper and hit it with some olive oil balsamic drizzle  
1572 2018-02-17 19:40:53 So in love with #Deceim #theordinary 100% Moroccan Argan oil! My hair appreciates you so flippin’ much! 
1573 2018-02-17 19:40:52 @GordonRamsay when is it good to use oil when cooking bacon?
1574 2018-02-17 19:40:49 we are trying to figure out whether this is a 'baby oil' situation in the 'not made for but made to be used on' or an 'emu oil' situation in which
1575 2018-02-17 19:40:46 “I-It’s a mix of oil, egg yolks and either vinegar or lemon juice! But... you can also add other spices or herbs as well, for flavor!”
1576 2018-02-17 19:40:36 Personally I feel that in terms of future content for,#gtaonline, given that there's a bundle of buisnesses going forward the only content that would be interesting, is more buisnesses, i.e a game's version of crypto, and same with oil, and precious metals,#rtl8000

1579 2018-02-17 19:39:58 Is it your claim then that oil is some kind of clean energy? That the tar sands oil is good for the environment?
1580 2018-02-17 19:39:56 Listen kids...don’t get a luxury car...getting my first oil change and the bill makes me want to lie in front of the car while it’s moving
1581 2018-02-17 19:39:33 If I may jump in here, the Vietnam War was crucial in eroding the foundations of the Fordist\ Warfare-Welfare state in the US. The Yom Kippur War undermined Detente and brought oil prices sky-high, sth that bought Soviet oligarchy another decade of stability.
1582 2018-02-17 19:39:27 Headed to get an oil change then get dress get drunk and head to the airport
1583 2018-02-17 19:39:26 I need to get my oil changed. But I don’t want to waste my Saturday doing that 
1584 2018-02-17 19:39:14 Oil stain ed go away
1585 2018-02-17 19:39:06 Attending the citizens grassroots 2500 ft setback from oil and gas ballot initiative volunteer training by @ColoradoRising Great to see @MarkforColorado running for CD2 here who supports the measure. Wish more Dem candidates would stick their neck out on it. #copolitics #fracking
1586 2018-02-17 19:38:50 Coconut oil is magic *even tho it smells so bad*
1587 2018-02-17 19:38:41 Oh, those facts are going to confuse some folks, my friend.  Facts and the repubs?  Think oil and water.

1589 2018-02-17 19:38:32 A stink bug crawled into my essential oil diffuser so there’s that
1590 2018-02-17 19:37:58 Log burner, luckily we inherited it with the house. We do have oil central heating but we only use it once in a while
1591 2018-02-17 19:37:54 I really dont see how MG Survive can be any fun after the 10 hour mark. The 1st time you stumble upon some walker gears, the 1st time you frantically complete a mission on a new map and difficulty, the 1st time you discover how OP oil traps are, and the 1st hour you spend...
1592 2018-02-17 19:37:40 mam też glinkę z the body shop z serii oil control i daje łagodniejsze efekty. ogólnie nie polecam używać takich glinek częściej niż 1 w tygodniu, bo mnie przesusza i w efekcie bardziej mi się twarz tłuści.
1593 2018-02-17 19:37:30 How about you empty your pockets so Canadians can see which big oil company falls out?
1594 2018-02-17 19:37:23 Look ,I am serious about what the CBD oil has done for me and my PTSD,I am not just trying to make a buck off my #MAGA FRIENDS..!This has helped me so much and ,no side effects like the Big Pharma Mind f drugs!
It's worth checking out!idk if u get from me!
1595 2018-02-17 19:37:16 Except when the olympics are over, you’ll still be changing oil for $9.00 an hour

1603 2018-02-17 19:36:49 It’s taken Jiffy Lube over an hour to change my oil, “because Fiat’s are hard.”

1605 2018-02-17 19:36:43 A back massage with hot oil would be sooo clutch rn. 
1606 2018-02-17 19:36:37 The answer is...  F*** No. Alberta's only source of real income is oil and yet they keep flaunting their wealth. Do some research, invest in new technologies and stop trying to pollute even more.

1610 2018-02-17 19:36:07 I Luv Vodka!  Spritzer for your linens: 1c Vodka + 1c H2O + 16 drops essential oil: to disinfect & freshen
1611 2018-02-17 19:36:07 They still burning gas oil and rubber for no good reason?
1612 2018-02-17 19:35:39 The northsea should be cheap (if there is no oil or gas), only to build it on water looks expensive to me, so bifacial most certainly is interesting to invest in.

I mostly pick by how tasty the flavor sounds.

1616 2018-02-17 19:35:04 If we could actually control Black Hole's effect in matter we would solve the energetic problem and we would actually stop using oil for cars and stuff
1617 2018-02-17 19:34:59 Pretty easy pickings with relatively minor crimes. Safe, middle road and best thing is, won't ever have to justify it in court
1618 2018-02-17 19:34:54 March 26 coming up; China plans to begin oil futures priced in Yuan. A beginning challenge to the petro-dollar. Will the USA be so desparate to preserve the petro-dollar that it will start WWIII?
1619 2018-02-17 19:34:32 Oh shit don't worry guys I got this. I'm going to need a glass of olive oil, 3 feet of gauze, a gerbil, and an ultra saber, the kind of lightsaber you can duel with.

1622 2018-02-17 19:34:29 Melt 1/2C coconut oil, 1/2C honey, juice of 1 lime, 1TBSP lime zest. Pour over dry ingredients. Bake on 2 sheets at 325 for 20m
1623 2018-02-17 19:34:23 Costco has the best price on avo oil and for the essential oils I go to Sprouts. NOW and Aura Cacia have the best price for the quality.
1624 2018-02-17 19:34:18 The US oil industry will not buy Chinese steel because they don't trust its integrity. The Chinese claim to test their products but they don't.
1625 2018-02-17 19:33:55 Hi Larry! Do you currently use essential oils or have a favorite oil?

1627 2018-02-17 19:33:24 I just tried it on the back if my hand and I think I'll get on with it! Don't want to feel like I'm smearing oil all over my face  
1628 2018-02-17 19:33:23 Why is why they lobby their respective governments to create disharmony in Iran 1) BP are still pissed off from when they got kicked out 2) Iranian oil is the purest in the world needing 0 additives

1635 2018-02-17 19:32:13 He's doing the job Trump wants him to do. Opening Natl Monuments/Parks to oil drilling, shrinking public lands for corp profits, increasing fees at Natl Parks so average ppl can't afford to go. Heckuva job, Zinke!
1636 2018-02-17 19:32:10 Have you tried peppermint or tea tree oil? They're known to help
1637 2018-02-17 19:32:03 It's tuna oil time
1638 2018-02-17 19:31:47 Sometimes treating my rosacea feels stupid but then I eat a little too much oil a few days in a row and/or see some other white guy who decided to stop treating his and I’m turned away from being uncomfortable so that I can eat/drink garbage that will make me more uncomfortable.
1639 2018-02-17 19:31:46 OIl contracts handed out by the U.S instilled puppet... they can't get hold of Iranian oil so they went after the 2nd best quality in the world
1640 2018-02-17 19:31:40 We love the Destress Express Oil so much! And our clients love getting hand massages with it while their hair colour processes.

1646 2018-02-17 19:30:33 I’ve seen organic CBD oil. I don’t live in a state that allows growing weed. But the CBD oil is available here. Is there any merit to trying this?
1647 2018-02-17 19:30:13 Niggas charged me $62 after the student discount just for a oil change. It was synthetic oil but still.... Toyota Charges $52 for a synthetic oil change, filter replacement, and tire rotation.

1651 2018-02-17 19:29:35 So @YourAlberta is really just Big Oil Alberta? Does not care about Albertan farmers with toxic abandoned wells on their properties? Explain and fix that Alberta otherwise why would B.C. have any faith in your words?
1652 2018-02-17 19:29:24 The oil change guy assured me that my car is NOT the messiest he's seen so I'll chalk that up as a win.
1653 2018-02-17 19:29:23 When you take the money from oil and gas, promote anti-humanity policies you need to go into hiding out of fear, to avoid the people who you are supposed to be serving!
1654 2018-02-17 19:29:23 I want to: I also want to buy diesel, veggies and meat, toiletries, tires, oil changes, vodka etc all while traveling for pleasure in motorhome full-time. If that can be done, I'm all in. 
Haven't figured out how to do all this, so far.

1656 2018-02-17 19:29:03 Financed by Dems? No. He's financed by PACs, mostly from oil and gas, coal, insurance and telco. I just meant the Dems drew the lines to encompass a lot of the conservative part of the state and threw it to him to make other districts more competitive.
1657 2018-02-17 19:28:58 Oil change it is. why does it take forever tho 
1658 2018-02-17 19:28:57 Me, someone who does not smoke weed b/c i can get drug tested at any time, would OBVIOUSLY know where to get cannabis oil for a vape pen.

1663 2018-02-17 19:27:36 Hoping to take care of it very shortly. Will speak further to my oil company on Monday. TBH we were planning on doing all of this in the spring.
1664 2018-02-17 19:27:30 Assad built public hospitals so he could bomb them and he also let isis take over his oil fields so they could sell it to him via Turkey 
1665 2018-02-17 19:27:18 We've already been at war with them for years. Why do you think this election operation started in 2014? That fall the Saudis (at US behest) opened the taps, driving down the price of oil, crippling the Russian economy in response to the incursion into Ukraine.
1666 2018-02-17 19:27:05 All I did today was go to the bank and get and oil change and I’m already tired.
1667 2018-02-17 19:27:03 About 2 years ago my friend was dating some sunflower oil nigga & when she broke it off negro came to get everything, even the lingerie nigga came for it. There was a katrash can in the kitchen boy boy took it too

1670 2018-02-17 19:26:39 Haven't had cancer but I do put oil on a bandage now. All I know at 56 is its not going to kill anyone & you can still function growing up to be a billionaire like Richard Branson or the Beatles. Have to educate not Taliban learning old benefits in the 21st century.
1671 2018-02-17 19:26:31 snake oil salesman, real con artist Huckabee at it again, stop your trick, maybe it’s time for you to pray for forgiveness of families of gun victims for religious right complicity! by their fruits you shall know them, look at WH press secretary, “Mike is my daddy!” stfu!

1674 2018-02-17 19:26:11 All the pro oil tools seem to think Alberta's jobs and income are more important than BC's. Not to mention BC's fisheries, tourism etc are not supported by billions in subsides.
We subsidize oil and we pay to clean up the messes they create. Great system.

1678 2018-02-17 19:25:14 I use it as skincare as well. I add peppermint in the summer because it’s cooling, but too much of that can be irritating. I’m a big fan of oils as skincare, even though I’m oily. Oil emulsifies oil and it balances your skin. Avo oil is crazy good for dry skin.

1687 2018-02-17 19:24:01 Yep and the camouflage outfits this shower are wearing must mean they are going to do some fighting in the oil! Or have they watched too many westerns and know baddies always wear black?
1688 2018-02-17 19:24:01 No allegation dear, but he didn't say investigation and as i noted before 4 pleas already, maybe 5 waiting on manaford, yo know chump campaign manager, and so you don't forget rex tillerson and exxon deal for the oil fields in russia, that's where it all started

1690 2018-02-17 19:23:48 "energy security" is a made up term to protect the oil industry from the rightful death renewables would cause them send tweet
1691 2018-02-17 19:23:38 I hate having to get my oil changed. Ugh.
1692 2018-02-17 19:23:37 I know that feeling when you can't stop touching your beard because it looks and feels so good. Just make sure you're not exaggerating with it, oil it up, and the itch will stop.

1694 2018-02-17 19:23:25 I’ve been wondering about that. Thank you! I’ll prob use it in the summer when my oil is the worst 
1695 2018-02-17 19:23:15 Why don’t some of these huge oil companies get together and pay for a massive nation wide ad campaign to get their word out. If opposition is being funded, why not spend some $ to gain support? Seems like it would be $ well used compared to another failed pipeline application
1696 2018-02-17 19:23:12 that's not oil, man, that's antifreeze

1701 2018-02-17 19:22:01 You mean Alberta needs to be bribed to do the right thing environmentally while BC did the right thing with no Federal payoff. The thanks BC gets for being proactive is to be forced to take your dirty oil? No thanks.

1729 2018-02-17 19:19:01 the world does not need our dirtiest of dirty oil. there’s plenty of cleaner & safer ways to extract it & we wouldn’t have to ship it through BC’s pristine waters & land, endangering countless living creatures & countless jobs. must we ruin our home because market demands it?

Also Pacific rim and an awful lot into NZ's 'grass-fed' dairy which now has its own dirty-dairy image. Unlike soybeans, PKE is a v.small % in relation to the oil. Palm is driven by oil use.

Who is buying the oil, gas and phosphate that is stolen from Syria? Does Bashar get a cut?

1826 2018-02-17 19:04:41 So im at the oil change place and these dudes just hooking me up with deals. They thought i was Albanian giving me family discounts .

1828 2018-02-17 19:04:27 Squawking about gun control, or realistic hardening of soft targets/ gun free zones? Which could happen sooner without lawsuits?
1829 2018-02-17 19:04:06 The moment he became SOS I nearly had a heart attack for that reason (Putin and ExxonMobile).  I'm in Texas. It's always about oil (for good reason).

1831 2018-02-17 19:03:29 Raw sewage from Victoria is much greater threat to Orcas then oil and gas
1832 2018-02-17 19:03:24 The issue is simply, the world still needs oil for 99.8% of automobiles.
Some where a company with shareholders will supply oil to the world.
Why should Canada not be a supplier instead countries with questionable human rights.

1863 2018-02-17 19:00:00 Baltimore is surrounded by eleven nearby high-output coal and oil power plants, along with a trash incinerator nobody likes. By subsidizing solar over parking lots, we can exceed their generational capacity for as little as $2/year from taxpayers, and get clean air and water.
1864 2018-02-17 19:00:00 You glistening with oil is sexy as f... :)
1865 2018-02-17 18:59:51 I was just sitting here thinking. Aren't there a bunch of similar skill sets between oil production and site clean up.  Maybe a net Zero for job loss v. gain? All this as part of the transition to renewables?
1866 2018-02-17 18:59:48 I am no shrinking violet either. Understand that CO2 is natural on this earth.  It was used by the trees, hence coal & used by the animals hence, oil. When anyone says it is a pollutant that is FAKE NEWS. Carbon taxes on home heating is an abusive use of power. Turn off your heat
1867 2018-02-17 18:59:48 I go to our dealership. Apple Valley Ford’s oil changes are $30 with tire rotation included. And, you vehicle is worth more on trade if they have all of the service records.

1917 2018-02-17 18:51:42 re (1) it would not have mattered as much, had the price of oil not collapsed AND the ussr had not become so dependent on it in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

1944 2018-02-17 18:48:14 Not bogus. Western Canada Select sells at a $30 discount to West Texas Oil. Only because the US buyers know whatever they offer us, we will take it. We don’t have the pipeline capacity to sell it to someone else. Meanwhile the rest of Canada pays full price. Good deal for USA.

1950 2018-02-17 18:47:22 Again, when subsidy was removed in 2016 cos of the price of crude oil. I asked then what if the price of crude oil jumps up, how do we then sustain the price at 145?

The reality is down on us now. Landing cost is now 171. 

Who bears the pain?
1951 2018-02-17 18:47:19 An article from 2012 before the oil price crash and you have the cheek to quote it. Saddo you have to go back 6 years. In case you missed it things are a lot different now.
1952 2018-02-17 18:47:13 My take on your Q: oil & gas a huge part of trade agreements we are either negotiating or signing. Alberta biggest player in the industrny so, like all other wealthy people/regions, gets a pass on policy that could be negatively interpreted?

1960 2018-02-17 18:46:28 Compared to regular political campaigns and lobbies such as big oil and unions that spend billions on elections a mere million dollars a month is a pathetically miniscule sum.
1961 2018-02-17 18:46:27 Justin Trudeau says he will use the Canadian Army to back big Texas oil and quell any disturbance on the K-M pipeline, even when it goes through private property. The same army he forsakes when it comes to their pensions? Hmm, that won't work.
1962 2018-02-17 18:46:20 Since yesterday i am spreading Bhushan steel, Binani & Essar Oil news in my groups to prove that this govt is not same UPA
1963 2018-02-17 18:46:12 Vitamin E oil  I have a whole thing I can give to u
1964 2018-02-17 18:46:08 “A road trip is the perfect reward for an oil change.” 

Bless those friends who rationalize your bullshit.
1965 2018-02-17 18:46:03 Yes, as Yesar says - this is crude oil, not refined product. There is no refinery in Ceyhan.
1966 2018-02-17 18:46:01 If I got surprise visitors now they’d think she’s not washed her hair in weeks and as for the face does she actually wash?!? I’m looking skanky but letting coconut oil do it’s magic. All a work in progress. 
1967 2018-02-17 18:45:57 ฝันดีนะคะ @iam_Oil
1968 2018-02-17 18:45:51 Getting an oil change @ Firestone rn & the employees are discussing if it's pronounced "winter" or "winner" bc of all the snow rn. Every employee that's been asked as responded "winner" in the most hick accent & the man upfront is getting so angry thx for the entertainment guys
1969 2018-02-17 18:45:49 need to get an oil change but everyone is full for the day 
1970 2018-02-17 18:45:47 Stir together 2 cups bluefish with 3 pints chips. Mix into  Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve with a nice chianti.
1971 2018-02-17 18:45:46 This also happened to me.... the castor oil is a miracle worker honestly. I literally had almost no eyelashes and the ones I did have were very short. They’re completely grown back in now though and it didn’t take too long for them to grow back!
1972 2018-02-17 18:45:42 the episode 'Tombstone' was called 'Brokeback Natural'. Or at honcon, when Misha said something about imagine the oil rig fanfiction that would be written and Jensen answering addressing the audience with 'Don't let us down'.
1973 2018-02-17 18:45:21 Is cbd oil legal in pa?
1974 2018-02-17 18:45:11 Michael, preheat the pan over a medium to high flame. A tablespoon of oil with a tablespoon of butter. Season with salt and/or pepper, brown each side for approx. 3 to 4 minutes. Bon appetit.
1975 2018-02-17 18:44:57 Oh shoot. I should have done this about Forte oil station in Maitama. I bought, Papa bought, Mama bought and brotherly also bought.... all in 1.30 hrs
1976 2018-02-17 18:44:55 This project was deemed 'in the national interest' (wrongly in my opinion) because it supposedly will diversify markets for Alberta oil to Asian markets, thereby fetching a better price. Nothing to do with activism.
1977 2018-02-17 18:44:51 Shell oil
Shell corporation
Shell game
Shell=empty, hollow
1978 2018-02-17 18:44:44 Now, I would def. drink a fish oil snake pepper beer.
1979 2018-02-17 18:44:28 Getting car inspected at local oil change place. They have 2 bays. There are 4-5 guys standing around and 2 guys working. I’m in the wrong line of work.
1980 2018-02-17 18:44:23 Such a stressful day... 
car's back at the garage again, this time with an oil leak and another bad sensor.
1981 2018-02-17 18:44:21 So you don't see a distinction between government propaganda and private speech? Government white supremacist campaign= MAGA protestor; Big pharma PR= numb nuts neighbor; Oil lobby = individual call to congressman; MSU athletics = abused gymnast.
1982 2018-02-17 18:44:19 40%... pas mal... I quan agafo tren normal, de Cambrils a BCN, 5,80€... Amb això no pago no el gas oil fins Altafulla... 
1983 2018-02-17 18:44:09 @segalink the prize of crude oil drops internationally and the prize of refined crude rises in Nigeria. The prize of crude oil rises internationally and the prize of refined crude also rises in Nigeria. Nigerians economy under APC has again defiled all known economic principles.
1984 2018-02-17 18:44:07 Also: Pharmaceuticals, Big Oil, Defense contractors, Insurance corps are essential to them. Dems get Education, Social justice, Science, and Environmental dollars. I like to joke that the donors are the best predictors of voting patterns, e.g. professors (educators) vote blue.
1985 2018-02-17 18:44:07 I use The Body Shop’s tea tree line. They’re completely natural and vegan . Tea tree oil is a natural acne healer. It works wonders!
1986 2018-02-17 18:44:07 Lol this #shiaisis kid wants to compare Egypt which is one of the worlds oldest polictical entities to Iraq a fake state made by the British to gain oil then gangbanged by America over & over again @mohamed_alemara

1991 2018-02-17 18:43:12 is not a favor is business. iran sells commodity all need oil. lots went on but it was all business. no love involved Iran.  was selling oil under spot market price and giving credit to some country is all business
1992 2018-02-17 18:42:59 Biting my tongue in Jiffy Lube while this dude mansplains an oil change to his wife. Honey she gets it
1993 2018-02-17 18:42:54 At the @Toyota Mason location for an oil change. The guy that got my paperwork together kept making comments about needing a beer, needing some excitement and suggested a shooting would do it, asked me for a gun, kept winking at me and suggested that I should hit him.
1994 2018-02-17 18:42:53 #inwakanda Shea butter, coconut oil, and cocoa butter r still a secret. 
1995 2018-02-17 18:42:24 @VinnieTortorich is sesame oil good, like olive oil, or bad, like vegetable oil? I'm seeing conflicting info on the interwebs (I know, crazy!)
1996 2018-02-17 18:42:15 This is so stupid. Enough with the whining. Develop green reneweables and get ahead. Then you can brag how Alberta saved Canada  I'd rather put up with that instead of having excess oil out of ground cause nobody's buying it. Jeez whiz.
1997 2018-02-17 18:42:09 Daughter, age 4.75, couldn't stop talking abt @hotwingsfbhw while the RAV got an oil change. Either she channeled him thru some dealership portal or, dare I say, her first crush? 
1998 2018-02-17 18:42:09 Oil and mineral rights.  It's always money = power.
1999 2018-02-17 18:41:58 awan brothers, iran cash, then donations to clinton foundation. Hati theft, worst oil spill in history in the gulf,
2000 2018-02-17 18:41:56 Just picked Jo up from work and she doesn't know I've made her chicken breast poached in a tomato and chilli sauce with Mediterranean roasted veg and Maris Piper chips cooked in extra virgin Rapeseed oil with sea salt and Paprika,hope she likes it.

2005 2018-02-17 18:40:31 Forbes says, 
CBD Oil Will Be A Billion Dollar Industry By 2020!!
Who's Interested In Selling It?

2006 2018-02-17 18:40:21 I always used warm olive oil and a cotton ball. Seems to help.

2009 2018-02-17 18:39:58 Saudi Arabia put out the $4 Trillion dollar IPO on Aramco they know oil is coming to an end. After the Oil no country will care at all for the Middle East just like no one cares about dying children in Africa today.
2010 2018-02-17 18:39:47 Yeah the vet and @PoodleWise recommended doing fish oil with his food and I really need to start doing that, I've been been lazy :(
2011 2018-02-17 18:39:41 Lol! Try getting the one that's not yet too ripe & let the oil get heated well enough before frying.
2012 2018-02-17 18:39:31 The power of oil! When applied, old rusted machines can work, flawlessly.
2013 2018-02-17 18:39:27 Avocado oil > Coconut oil
2014 2018-02-17 18:39:25 Smalling is the worst player united ever had...
2015 2018-02-17 18:39:23 Oil filter on the motor....the permashorts are going to lose it.
2016 2018-02-17 18:39:19 I had a 2nd cousin who was twice removed. She was removed from both Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners for vaping hash oil next to small children
2017 2018-02-17 18:39:05 Estimado @DiegoG48 Lo que hay que bajar, es el costo de mover el agua (ENERGÍA), ya se eléctrica o gas oil. El riego ya sea por gravedad o pivot, lo más caro y hace inviable, es el movimiento del agua. Lo que @UnsoloUruguay reclama, bajar costo energético.
2018 2018-02-17 18:38:59 Is there oil of some kind involved?
2019 2018-02-17 18:38:39 @Sightline has been doing fossil fuel research region-wide since 2005, including LNG. Methanol, oil trains and Tacoma being NW most threatened city by fossil fuels have been research topics for years. 
 #ThinGreenLine
2020 2018-02-17 18:38:33 Oil changes and planning a CSGO tournament. Want to sponsor an event?
2021 2018-02-17 18:38:33 It’s too expensive and previous to waste. Mind you the last time I did that it overshot the palette and hit the cat. Getting oil paint off a cat ain’t easy!
2022 2018-02-17 18:38:26 @ultshanator hi buddy :) what’s the name of your beard oil
2023 2018-02-17 18:38:03 You're soulless?  That's a laugh! They're either greedy,  despicable humans or dumb as a damned box of rocks.  They fell for #DonTheCon , the greatest snake oil salesman on both sides of the Mississip!
2024 2018-02-17 18:38:03 #GasTAX
We are one of the largest crude oil and gas exporters but our gas is going to cost us more?? We are penalized for our success? Congress ,what part of too high cost of living for middle income  Americans don’t you get?
2025 2018-02-17 18:37:49 Get a new one if you don’t want your shit to blow, as for the oil pressure gauge, I wouldn’t rely on it too much as it is a 10 or more year old car.. but non the less should indicate where your at with oil. I rather physically look at it with my own eyes get me on the dip stick
2026 2018-02-17 18:37:46 @lindseyvonn all the best for the following races, Lindsey. In Flemish we say ‘taent drijft boven’. Translated it means that ‘Talent in competition behaves like oil in the water. It always comes to the surface.’ #thumbsup!
2027 2018-02-17 18:37:16 I remember back in one of your video you was telling you take Xanax ....maybe that don't agree with the chemistry in your body.... it could be affecting you.. maybe you should try burning some Merle frankincense and oil try drinking herbal tea for your anxiety help you sleep
2028 2018-02-17 18:37:04 The only thing your 'new science' is saying is that DilBit will float, making it somewhat easier to recover. But the average encounter rate for oil spilled in the marine environment worldwide is still in the range of 10-15%.
2029 2018-02-17 18:36:59 #InWakanda all shower water is 3% jojoba oil
2030 2018-02-17 18:36:57 How can you make oil boil...?
2031 2018-02-17 18:36:47 MSM did far more to manipulate our elections than any foreigners did.MSM exasperates every situation they touch.remember the BP oil spill in the gulf, Deepwater Horizon 8 years ago.MSM made it sound like the Florida panhandle beaches were destroyed. It hurt business for YEARS.
2032 2018-02-17 18:36:39 You are correct. Look for a rapid reversal in oil. Bounce at $55 is my view.
2033 2018-02-17 18:36:35 Bought some olbas oil today so will try it out X
2034 2018-02-17 18:36:19 incorporated tea tree into the coconut oil moisturizer last night and alas it has betrayed me
2035 2018-02-17 18:36:14 but also teatree oil helps (dilute it first tho!!) or you can crush some aspirin and mix it with water and put that paste on
2036 2018-02-17 18:36:14 im oil can harry and im bed
2037 2018-02-17 18:36:07 I had the same engine..it reads accurate. Watch a YouTube video how to check your oil 
2038 2018-02-17 18:35:59 The forward thinking pond that tries to make the country healthier, take less sick days, and prevent disease from going untreated and causing disability. You are on the wrong side of history. plus trump hired more goldman sachs, crooked oil, money laundering, liars than anyone
2039 2018-02-17 18:35:54 This is dog whistle journalism David.  Do you want to add to your comments that the same group had Rex  Murphy, champion of the oil sector, on last year ?
2040 2018-02-17 18:35:30 Y’all ever feel under dressed for an oil change 
2041 2018-02-17 18:35:23 TEHRAN- Khamenei adviser Gen. Safavi: To recover part of its expenditure in Syria, Islamic Republic has secured right to operate Syrian oil, gas, phosphate resources and is exporting increasing quantities.

2045 2018-02-17 18:35:01 what tay said !!! try to drink more water and use caster oil at night / seeing if reducing alcohol intake makes a difference
2046 2018-02-17 18:34:57 I love orange essential oil
2047 2018-02-17 18:34:43 What no cooking oil? How will you cope?
2048 2018-02-17 18:34:38 Have you actually researched it? I clicked 3 links, none from what I'd consider strong sources because no other reputable info was available, and all draw the same conclusion... It's SUSPECTED that all major events COULD be linked based on suspected or known dx of the shooters
2049 2018-02-17 18:34:34 To anyone that know's the word "Baskeet" knows what i mean. But leeds is Baskeet central. My word they're oil paintings the majority of them.. 
2050 2018-02-17 18:34:29 I remember in 1986 when Brent Crude was $9.50/bbl ($26.46 in today's money). History shows that the nature of the oil industry is one of peaks and troughs. UK heavily based itself on financial services and that brought UK to within 2 hours of a third bailout in 2008.
2051 2018-02-17 18:34:24 i bleached mine twice and stripped the black dye out ((which took three times)) and its not bad. coconut oil saves it. if anything don’t go too far up so you’re comfortable cutting what’s dead off when it grows out a bit
2052 2018-02-17 18:34:18 Even oil and water are both liquids
2053 2018-02-17 18:34:02 You know you live in the north country when the halftime raffle prize at the high school basketball game is $100 of fuel oil.  #fb
2054 2018-02-17 18:34:01 Love #argan oil? Remember that it's only made in #Morocco. If it comes from another country, it's probably not the real thing.
2055 2018-02-17 18:33:56 There is no in between with these people.
2056 2018-02-17 18:33:34 #Hezbollah's leader #Nasrallah: #US allowed #ISIS to intrude into easter #Syria to later occupy oil & gas fields in the area thru #Kurds.They said they'd leave SYR when #Daesh gone but the occupation will continue. US looks at regional developments thru oil lens."
2057 2018-02-17 18:33:24 I feel rlly ugly right now but I replied to ur tweet late last night and thought it was for another tweet. I just got normal castor oil from the nutrition house at the mall!
2058 2018-02-17 18:33:08 I have come to the conclusion that somehow on a $70 oil change that takes 15 minutes, they must make no money, can’t ever leave without an estimate for $500 on something.  How about if that thing you want to fix in advance breaks down, I’ll call ya back.
2059 2018-02-17 18:32:53 なんで赤しいたけさんいないの？
2060 2018-02-17 18:32:53 God bless my dad. He put new tires on my car and paid for my oil change today

2062 2018-02-17 18:32:51 We moved here about 2 years ago, the oil Aga having been installed in 1995. It is a 2 door one which also heats the water and a central heating boiler is also part of it. We have no other cooker so I did lots of research before we moved and it’s been a learning curve ever since
2063 2018-02-17 18:32:45 Welcome!

And a little tip: mint oil, massaged on the forehead or temples, sometimes helps even better than any pills. At least when it's from stress. 
2064 2018-02-17 18:32:32 Scientists invented a new sponge for cleaning up oil spills. The best way to clean up oil is still to stop using it. We've literally already invented perpetual energy. Clinging to oil halts important fields of science. We should have 5 million colonists on Mars by now.
2065 2018-02-17 18:32:27 Waters, Ever State that hinders or prevents oil exploration & development should pay a subsidy to those States that provide them with petroleum products. The mentality of "Not in my backyard" should have consequences.
2066 2018-02-17 18:31:58 It is supposed to have the largest oil reserve in the world, more than Saudi Arabia. It’s a real game changer for Israel.
2067 2018-02-17 18:31:49 Have a very busy day. Get a oil change on the Jeep. Spend ridiculous amount of money at Costco on stuff I don’t need. Drop off shirts at dry cleaners, visits parents for a bit. End the night with a poker session at my house! Now all I need is energy to get out of these pajamas
2068 2018-02-17 18:31:44 What r they deciding, this ball is a goal
2069 2018-02-17 18:31:44 This decision was poor

2073 2018-02-17 18:31:18 Brothers, help me thank God, my phone crashed and told me to reset some minutes ago, but after some heavy praying and soaking the phone in anointing oil, I restarted it and now it's working again.
2074 2018-02-17 18:31:08 Overheard at STEMfest:

Dad: “So kids what did you learn?” 
Kids: “Water is heavier than oil!”
Dad: “Exactly, and that’s what dad is made of. That’s why he sinks.”

#relatingtotherealworld
2075 2018-02-17 18:31:07 I ain’t gone lie I don’t think I’ve had my oil changed since I got my car 
2076 2018-02-17 18:31:00 I guess we should just grow more oil palms.
2077 2018-02-17 18:30:50 Lobbying disclosures show that oil and gas companies were quite active on the Hill on the FUTURE Act, 45Q, and CCUS.
2078 2018-02-17 18:30:47 I  was born to drive electric  vehicles not oil polluting  cars
2079 2018-02-17 18:30:35 So far today I’ve been asked by random people on the street “do you want a free prayer?” Me: “no thanks.” And then “do you know what neem oil is used for?” Me: “yes, I do actually.” 
2080 2018-02-17 18:30:35 Just needs thicker oil. Maybe gearbox oil. Or crude.
2081 2018-02-17 18:30:25 was marine 
i was heavy-duty open-chain 
yeah it's spray immersion foot 
toward a bitter almond oil
2082 2018-02-17 18:30:23 Turkana should also forfeit the 10BILLION given to them in devolved funds every year & wait for OIL revenue after TULLOW sells the OIL,why should the central Gov give them so much money if they don’t want to cooperate with the GOV always giving ultimatums
2083 2018-02-17 18:30:23 Whatever seasoning you like on your steak put on you veggies. I put steak seasoning on asparagus, carrots, and Brussel sprouts. Roast in oven with a lil olive oil for like 15 minutes. It’s bomb as hell
2084 2018-02-17 18:30:13 I HATE GETTING OIL CHANGES
2085 2018-02-17 18:30:01 Being a prophetic pastor in Ghana has become legal scamming by means of selling frytol (anoiting oil), well-water (aburam nsuo), red-eggs etc, expensively to the poor.
Open Eyes!
2086 2018-02-17 18:29:58 In a world moving beyond oil dependcey it is hard to justify the risk to our western coast.
2087 2018-02-17 18:29:49 IAEA: Russia increases naval presence in Baltic Sea claiming that they are containing the oil spill. Sweden states increased radioactivity the area...
2088 2018-02-17 18:29:38 Just steamed for me, Brenda. With a little olive oil and lemon. Trying to eat healthier and cut calories/fat. I went overboard in NYC and Valentines Day too!
2089 2018-02-17 18:29:31 かわいすぎぅ…
2090 2018-02-17 18:29:29 never mind that we don't know how the oil will be used once sold. plastics? gas? diesel? how much carbon will be put into the atmosphere from those things?
2091 2018-02-17 18:29:05 Seamed? Like an oil seam. Correct no one gave a fuck. Bought & sold like a parcel of rogues. Shameful
2092 2018-02-17 18:28:59 NEW DELHI- Despite flattery on both sides, visiting President Rouhani fails to persuade Indian Premier Modi to release the $18 billion that India owns Iran for oil imports. Modi claims sanctions by US prevent that. Suggests Iran buy Indian goods for that amount in barter deal.
2093 2018-02-17 18:28:55 Just when I thought waiting for my oil change in the most uncomfortable chair in the world couldn’t get any worse, a man comes&sits RIGHT NEXT TO ME&starts slurping his coffee like it’s a damn ASMR video!!!!R U FUCKIN KIDDING ?? And then his flip phone goes off n he goes YELLOW??
2094 2018-02-17 18:28:53 Too busy running around and playing outside. Only other time I've heard/felt (actually got woken up by) something like that was the explosion at Buncefield oil pumping station - I was asleep in Suffolk and the explosion was in Hertfordshire. It was really loud.
2095 2018-02-17 18:28:47 Then they'll just blow you up with scavenged explosives from fireworks, fuel oil and fertilizer, home depot rental trucks,  tractor trailers, etc.  Please people, think about root cause and not the symptoms!!! #think #mentalhealth #hollywoodviolence
2096 2018-02-17 18:28:46 This Dabur Oil 
Majbut jod Ad
Is the worst I have seen in recent times
Kya logic hai Girl vs Boy
2097 2018-02-17 18:28:42 Bae made us toothpaste from bentonite clay / coconut oil / baking soda / peppermint / eucalyptus & I feel like I just came out the dentist office every time. It’s great
2098 2018-02-17 18:28:39 exactly, the CONSUMER reduces consumption, so why tax the producer of oil when the CO2 is released in large part by the USA in the USA?   Canada should CO2 tax the IMPORT of oil to eastern refineries.
2099 2018-02-17 18:28:30 Their sources are a bit quiet.
Oh well, nuff death.
Pizza was a nice tea.
I drizzle olive oil pre oven.
Some on the food.
Waitrose Belgian bun for pud.
We agreed unadventurous, but who needs that on a weary Saturday?
2100 2018-02-17 18:28:28 Finally you said to much.The money trail always reveals its self.The top republican in intelligence has shares in Russian oil. That's why, like you didn't know,he couldn't sign the sanctions. Your dad the same.LISTEN(its illegal) .
2101 2018-02-17 18:28:24 Can anyone explain why it's called the year of the dog? @NASAMoon
2102 2018-02-17 18:28:16 Send this down to the mangroves and ecologically sensitive delta regions in oil producing nations. With the oil theft and illegal refining, Nigeria could really use this.
2103 2018-02-17 18:28:11 It would have been interesting to bring ALL THE CHILDREN who’s parents are directly and indirectly employed in the oil and gas sector into the room. Or equate how many students per classroom eat and have shelter due to Alberta O&G!!
2104 2018-02-17 18:28:02 Stuck at the mall while gett g an oil change. God do I miss places like Walden Books. There was a Doubleday at the KoP that had comfy leather wingback chairs back in the 90s, too.
2105 2018-02-17 18:28:02 5-2 Yotes considering they are playing better and Oil gave up.
2106 2018-02-17 18:27:53 oh you know me well! ....are you a poster on the LSE board. The shame is people are following me and I dont know who they are?
2107 2018-02-17 18:27:52 Fc Tucker 100 year anniversary at Lucas oil last night
2108 2018-02-17 18:27:50 You don't think oil company execs are sociopathic? You don't think the prison for profit or medical for profit are sociopathic models? Who did they support? Who did more damage to us those sociopaths or Putin?
2109 2018-02-17 18:27:44 So,  I haven't cooked anything apart from noodles in weeks and  today I decided to cook,  gas finished as I put oil on fire 

2110 2018-02-17 18:27:37 Once someone mentions coconut oil as part of their skin care routine that’s when I stop listening
2111 2018-02-17 18:27:35 Creep. Nope, to have credibility she would have to have reported on the Security Dog poisoned at Kirby Misperton by two of her own side. And as for Dan's credibility, how's Sefton's share printing machine working these days? I'll bet its more productive than your oil wells
2112 2018-02-17 18:27:26 Sure I can’t remember basic trig functions for precalc, or all the presidents and their parties for American History... but what I can remember are REALLY important things

2114 2018-02-17 18:26:39 yes, it works when the CONSUMER of oil is taxed. Why are we taxing our oil PRODUCERS and hurting a major export industry?  Senseless. USA uses our oil, but pays no CO2 tax . We sell oil @ BIG discount to USA  but CO2 tax our producers... Only Canada would be so stupid.
2115 2018-02-17 18:26:35 And the countries that are not doing well?
Like oil rich Venezuela!

I don't care about other countries, it is completely irrelevant to our situation.
This is a childish and simplistic argument and it should only merit contempt.
And thats what your argument is getting from me.
2116 2018-02-17 18:26:19 He substituted No Proof..with No allegation...snake oil artist
2117 2018-02-17 18:26:04 I wouldn't say that's the reason. Just look at Iraq where American oil companies are almost completely out of the loop.
2118 2018-02-17 18:25:57 if they had reported the truth about  oil crisis in 1973 and events in 1975 - we'd hve had Gough for a decade and no Fraser or Howard Govts
2119 2018-02-17 18:25:51 
2120 2018-02-17 18:25:22 Gonna burn the midnight oil in the field.
2121 2018-02-17 18:25:10 I remember playing golf in Oman as a kid. The greens were ‘browns’ (oil slicked sand) and you carried around a patch of astro to play off...
2122 2018-02-17 18:25:02 Go vegan love. You can eat unlimited amounts of plant products without restricting your calories. Try to reduce your use of oil and switch to sea salt. Try some lower fat/sodium and cholesterol free mock meat alternatives like @gardein that can be found in Walmart and target :)
2123 2018-02-17 18:24:59 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
2124 2018-02-17 18:24:58 I got some glass noodle package that came with it's own seasonings.. 

While I may not like vinegar, the amount of chili oil in there is insane orz
2125 2018-02-17 18:24:56 Pleasure Martin "well"bourne...lucky oil name!.....but you have a beard LOL !!!
2126 2018-02-17 18:24:47 Oil industry lobbying, and to a lesser degree, support from the coal industry.

Oil and gas interests see CO2-EOR as key pathway to further expand US production, and a massive subsidy for the key input (CO2) makes it viable.
2127 2018-02-17 18:24:45 Shes being childish. The fact is Bc wants and deserves world class oil spill clean up and to be honest a bigger share of pie. They maybe taking it out of groubdbut need other provinces coperation to see it thru equal partnership or bust @RachelNotley
2128 2018-02-17 18:24:39 I've actually used someone's olive oil to put on my pencil lipliner lol
2129 2018-02-17 18:24:36 Yes, you can virtually rub it in too if you still want the experience.  @jthavest has made a snake oil video on his #vlog of the best way to rub in virtual snake oil.
2130 2018-02-17 18:24:36 What is that looks like oil or volcanic rock
2131 2018-02-17 18:24:27 I'm probably needing more joint lubrication oil
2132 2018-02-17 18:24:26 You been huffing oil if you think you could do me like that.

2134 2018-02-17 18:24:23 Well as I set of to take @emmalukex and @lilyhalliday101 back to London last thing I expects was to break down just outside Wembley stadium and be stuck there for 5 hours, only to find out I needed a bit water and oil in my tank never driving down again hi
2135 2018-02-17 18:24:12 As someone that has used oil for all my working life Chris and trying to move towards water based products, this is the best satin that I’ve used.. #getwhatyoupayfor

2137 2018-02-17 18:23:10 My resolution to order heating oil before it runs out is still just that. Aaaargh!  #airlocked
2138 2018-02-17 18:22:58 Your president has bought shares in Russian oil. And guns.Trump and some Top republicans have bought shares in Russian oil. This is why they won't sign the sanctions congress wrote. Putin has them under his thumb. You will need tissues .TIC TOC
2139 2018-02-17 18:22:54 IAEA: Russian oil refinery near the Baltic Sea ruptures in a catastrophic explosion. 15,000 dead in surrounding areas. Russia states that they are handling the situation.
2140 2018-02-17 18:22:47 Ship oil, not Dilbit. That's the killer - just ask Washington State
2141 2018-02-17 18:22:28 DID YOU CHECK OIL SUPPLIERS SYNOPSIS OF THE 2016 & 2017? RUSSIA BEAT SAUDI ARAB,VENEZUELA AND USA! HOW? US ON EXPANSION OF WAR TO PROTECT ISRAEL BUT RUSSIA  ON COLLECTION OF OIL FROM IRAN AND ARAB COUNTRIES LIKE IRAQ,QATAR,SAUDI ARAB,SYRIA & UAE!
2142 2018-02-17 18:22:09 Tea tree oil :) great for acne and eczema! Just mix a few drops with some coconut oil and you can use all over your body. I know a lot of cleaners dry out the skin really bad, try to find one for sensitive skin plus moisturize right after.
2143 2018-02-17 18:22:01 I hope this oil change dont take forever
2144 2018-02-17 18:21:55 If you're really brave, and really serious about getting crispy fries from the oven, then skip the olive oil (which has too low a smoke point for this recipe anyway) and use bacon fat.

2148 2018-02-17 18:21:08 How my mum teaches me a new dish and why it takes me a while to learn it:
Mum: Peel two cloves of garlic
Me: Done! 
Mum: When I said two I didn’t mean JUST TWO! Go peel two more.
Me: So... two more yh?
Mum: Do you need this olive oil in your ears?

2149 2018-02-17 18:21:04 I thoroughly support the EVs! No emissions, no noise, more space in the interior and fantastic accelaration! You dont need to change the clutch, the oil and you use the brakes less!
2150 2018-02-17 18:20:50 Lee says to pay for it, they can put a severance tax on oil and gas.

2155 2018-02-17 18:20:22 Biotin and caster oil smells vile but is really good warmed up massage into your scalp.
2156 2018-02-17 18:20:19 You're probably due for an oil change and some hardware updates then.
2157 2018-02-17 18:19:53 Someone who attacks people while naked at night, by digging trenches through the wall, specifically timber houses,scares them, then runs out through the front door, before being caught, without stealing anything. Applies engine oil on his body to become slimy.
2158 2018-02-17 18:19:44 Huh. Who knew getting your oil changed (and topped off) would make your car squeak less.
2159 2018-02-17 18:19:44 I need to go get an oil change

I just wanted some leafy blood replenishing greens for after my cycle.

Imma be treating myself like this after every cycle.
2164 2018-02-17 18:19:11 .@HeyAprill any recommendations for a gentle oil cleanser & night cream from the #kbeauty lines at @cvspharmacy? Have you written about what's available there & I missed it?

2166 2018-02-17 18:18:51 I think you’re wrong. I think the federal government is wading into provincial jursidiction. We have the right to refuse to allow pollution of our lakes, rivers, streams and forests. If Alberta wants to avoid that conflict then they need to fly the oil to ocean shores.
2167 2018-02-17 18:18:49 chased my cbd oil with cold brew and now i'm borderline panic attack listening to this japanese badalamenti-esque calming music
2168 2018-02-17 18:18:30 Why is Aneeka eating sugar and palm oil?
2169 2018-02-17 18:18:20 YES IT IS TRUTH! DID YOU BELIEVE RUSSIA BECOME NO.1 GLOBAL OIL SUPPLIER OF THE WORLD BY BEATING USA,SAUDI ARAB AND VENEZUELA? WHY TRUMP PICKED REX TILLERSON IN HIS CABINET? BECAUSE HE WAS COO OF EXXON!
2170 2018-02-17 18:17:59 Dear Junior, thankyou for sending us in the right direction.Your dad and several top republicans have bought shares of Russian oil,guns,(woman?)They won't sign the sanctions congress drew.Because their money is there.Thanks.Tic Toc, is always about money.

2175 2018-02-17 18:17:02 It won't remain at $55 dollars a barrel forever. The oil price crash in the '80s was worse. It's just the nature of the business. Future economics is an unknown variable and a country can't switch to and fro between self-rule & dependency to suit changes in economic performance.
2176 2018-02-17 18:16:57 He must need the praise from his rich buddies in the oil industry.

2183 2018-02-17 18:15:49 It helps me in much more ways. I can become so fixated on a task that I don't eat or drink (not purposely). I wouldn't use cannibis during the day because I didn't like feeling high or smelling of weed so having cbd oil is a godsend.
2184 2018-02-17 18:15:48 Christianity & Conservative much like water & oil imho

2210 2018-02-17 18:12:37 Excellent observation. I think most Americans have the notion that Russia is a massive monolithic empire with vast power and resources. This notion was fueled by the Cold War propaganda. In fact, they are weak, have little but oil, demographic decline, and low birthrate.
2211 2018-02-17 18:12:28 Those semi submersible ships are freaking amazing! Had the pleasure of seeing one carry an oil derrick as big as a building through NOLA  a few years back.
2212 2018-02-17 18:12:26 So you think by polluting British Columbia and it’s waters and shipping tar oil it to China will stop climate change because Alberta is not doing it? #ScheerStupidity
2213 2018-02-17 18:12:24 Story doesn’t really support the headline. But in any case, Syrian #oil output was only ever about half the projected 2018 rise in US production.
2214 2018-02-17 18:12:10 Seriously, Alcohol and gambling as an economy to replace #Alberta oil and gas!

2226 2018-02-17 18:10:43 Alberta has over 300,000 derelict oil wells which they have not delt with. This doesn't give British Columbians any confidence if there was an oil spill in BC, that Alberta would be forthcoming to help with the cleanup costs.
2227 2018-02-17 18:10:36 Really? China been buying about 300kbpd. UNIpEc saying they were buying around 150-200kbpd. Petrochina buying around 75kbpd which they sell to Venezuela. Not leaving much for the teapots which have traditionally run heavy fuel oil from the state companies.

2229 2018-02-17 18:10:12 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
2230 2018-02-17 18:10:10 Uses Avaera coconut oil. 

Sees doctor. 

Needs lab work. 

Blood type: coconut oil.
2231 2018-02-17 18:10:08 It's not really about the oil at this point.

2233 2018-02-17 18:10:00 Nag efficascent oil ka ba uli ???
2234 2018-02-17 18:09:40 I keep a mixture of olives, anchovies and garlic in oil for when I need something really strong, such as radicchio.
2235 2018-02-17 18:09:40 I agree, I mean Sesame Oil...!
2236 2018-02-17 18:09:39 #NP Neil And Adam @neiladammusic - Oil Fire on @FullImpactRadio
2237 2018-02-17 18:09:35 I went yesterday and was told “oooh (dramatic head shake) according to car fax you’re overdue for a transmission flush, we can do it today starting at $150.” What part of ‘just an oil change’ don’t they understand?
2238 2018-02-17 18:09:28 I’d change your oil if my arm wasn’t dead ):
2239 2018-02-17 18:09:16 Are you using that same rationale regarding every other oil tanker on your coast? 
Just curious.
2240 2018-02-17 18:09:16 If blood didnur come out we will pour red oil
2241 2018-02-17 18:09:09 i’m here getting my oil change and this dude is trying to perform his demos live for me 

s o s
2242 2018-02-17 18:08:53 The bigger question is how do you get peppers out of fish or oil out of snakes?
2243 2018-02-17 18:08:40 Can anyone explain our campaign finance laws? A lawmaker, who makes the laws that affect industries such as guns, oil companies, Big pharma, can legally accept millions of dollars in donations from these companies? Isn't that a conflict of interest? Isn't that buying votes?
2244 2018-02-17 18:08:38 Acabo de comprar castor oil, soy una dramática
2245 2018-02-17 18:08:34 ANIME ART ISNT REAL ART! YOU HAVE TO PAIBT OIL LANDSCAPES TO BE A REAL ARTIST
2246 2018-02-17 18:08:00 Was in Frankie & Benny’s last night and Ally was eating a hot dog and it legit squirted oil onto my face and the guys head behind me when he bit into it 
2247 2018-02-17 18:07:58 A place slower then the DMV? The dealership when you need an oil change.
2248 2018-02-17 18:07:56 TWICE JESUS fought against Flawed Masculinity and its Sexualization of women:At the Jacob's well  when disciples imputed sexual motives between Jesus&Samalitan woman and between Jesus&Mary when Mary anointed his feet with oil.We can love without sexualizing love.
2249 2018-02-17 18:07:53 they obviously made a deal back in 68 with big oil all in a big fight over the water supply
2250 2018-02-17 18:07:51 So sad  palm oil is in most food products
2251 2018-02-17 18:07:35 Finally getting my oil changed and of course they are very busy. Ugh.
2252 2018-02-17 18:07:20 my hair is long enough to have to use hair oil again lol
2253 2018-02-17 18:07:10 Hey, while there’s oil in the ground there’s profits to be made
2254 2018-02-17 18:07:03 @RachelNotley @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau @UBCIC When a Gov't tells you selling oil helps climate change, what does that tell you about that Gov't. #Understanding. This sounds like Trump's climate change plan, sell more and hope for the best. Great Education Premier Notley
2255 2018-02-17 18:06:44 Where do you buy your CBD oil from? I can’t find it anywhere! 
2256 2018-02-17 18:06:41 oil money and generational wealth is such a beautiful thing they have no limits over there
2257 2018-02-17 18:06:36 someone is hiding the sesame oil from me
2258 2018-02-17 18:06:35 All the people complaining about the oil industry better not be driving cars, heating their homes, using plastics etc....or u are hypocrites
2259 2018-02-17 18:06:33 Felt like playing some hearthstone while waiting for my oil change. Finally finish downloading 700mb update and get into the menu, and the car is ready 
2260 2018-02-17 18:06:31 出会えて良かった…
2261 2018-02-17 18:06:27 何時から寝てたんだ俺は
2262 2018-02-17 18:06:17 Sitting out side the car dealership where I get my oil changed with my car off, because they are closed and It took all of my motivation to get here. I think I'll stay here all day.
2263 2018-02-17 18:06:03 Pro tip: 

Add a little coconut oil when cooking kale. It makes scraping it into the trash so much easier.
2264 2018-02-17 18:05:59 LMAOOOOOO 
2265 2018-02-17 18:05:58 It's always amusing to hear "religiously filled " marriage advice.. coming from folk who only know marriage in theory! When you jump that broom...You betta be ready to work the oil out of those 5 scriptures...that you keep quoting #20YearVet #WisdomSpeaketh
2266 2018-02-17 18:05:47 The only thing I don’t like about that Remy video is her sitting in that tub of car oil. Rubbing it thru the bum ass lace front.
2267 2018-02-17 18:05:34 Almost nothing makes me angrier than when a breakfast place offers me maple syrup and gives me fake stuff-- I'd rather eat my oatmeal with motor oil.
2268 2018-02-17 18:05:31 I GOT CBD OIL IM BUZZING
2269 2018-02-17 18:05:16 It’s more than just oil. It’s liquid engineering!
2270 2018-02-17 18:05:08 castor oil + Rose hip + vitamin e + essential oil.
2271 2018-02-17 18:05:07 Two maintenance workers were killed when an explosion followed by a fire  ripped through the Saipol vegetable oil refinery in Dieppe today.
2272 2018-02-17 18:05:06 But I've heard great things about vaping CBD oil for anxiety so I'll give that a go
2273 2018-02-17 18:04:45 Palm oil? #biofuels
2274 2018-02-17 18:04:44 Actually the Lamborghini im about to get costs around $600 for an oil change. Wish it was $50 sis
2275 2018-02-17 18:04:36 Helen, I your attitude. I can remember this a lot as a kid. The bath would be getting cold, then whoosh some boiling lot of waterput some nice bath oil in it 
2276 2018-02-17 18:04:00 Or, a country with no real leadership or vision who needs oil $ conspired with American traitors to try to maintain their loosening grip on a world that is trying to move on. The dustbin of history awaits you and your coconspirators.
2277 2018-02-17 18:03:45 Trump is to serious like oil is to water
2278 2018-02-17 18:03:32 And the reason Putin wanted Donald to win has everything to do with sanctions. Specifically a $500Billion oil deal (mentioned in Steele Dossier) which was penned by SOS Rex Tillerson. Trump immediately starting trying to remove them to the extent that it alarmed career diplomats
2279 2018-02-17 18:03:03 Take the speck out of your own eye, my brother.  Aligning yourself with a con man who will sell you snake oil because you think it will turn back the clock is foolish.  When you lie down with dogs you get fleas.  You are in my prayers.
2280 2018-02-17 18:02:42 We are actually doing just the opposite..,especially in Oklahoma.. We are causing slippage between plates by pumping water into old voids which were once filled with crude oil..
2281 2018-02-17 18:02:41 @TheDoctors Is it ok to take fish oil pills while on Eliquis???

I make sure there is loads left, next day pulled, then heated quickly in a frying pan with a dot of garlic oil, hoisin sause. In wraps,crunchy lettuce, cucumber, spring onion. Like chinese duck!
2287 2018-02-17 18:01:58 Oh bloody #great just run out of heating oil #massivepain in the ass
2288 2018-02-17 18:01:57 Respectfully, your calcs are inaccurate. You are not including Scottish Oil & Gas revenues, a UK Treasury company registered in England. Transfer these profits into the Scottish returns & you are in for a big surprise! Scotland is a net contributor to the UK. Please apologise.
2289 2018-02-17 18:01:23 Omg please don’t slip cause the oil stuff!
2290 2018-02-17 18:01:19 PM works on the interests of Canada. These are NOT served by being a Boy Scout on the CO2 file, while the USA gets 'off the hook' on CO2 footprint by using OUR energy.  CDN's should get CO2 tax CREDIT on exported oil +  Eastern CDN's should pay HUGE CO2 tax on IMPORTED oil.
2291 2018-02-17 18:01:03 1) one bar? R u on the underground tour?  2) the plan is to cross Snoqualmie Pass this Tu & Fr; looks like one good day & one bad.  Brand new M+S tires are gonna help.  Off to change the oil, sans souci.  Go  !
2292 2018-02-17 18:01:02 Morgan Stanley Sees Oil Price Risk Skewed to Upside
2293 2018-02-17 18:00:35 The Beekeeper has started charging TG a pound every time she leaves a door open, to go towards the oil bill. Luckily she's not spent a penny of birthday or Christmas money in years so we should be able to afford to fill the tank soon enough
2294 2018-02-17 18:00:19 Ahh thankyou. I am honoured xx
2295 2018-02-17 18:00:19 Alberta’s idea of clean growth is the most bizarre concept I’ve heard yet!! Tar sands, orphaned oil wells, show us clean growth?
2296 2018-02-17 18:00:14 It's really sad that they're making such a big deal of a movie. There's a go fund me page to send some local kids to see it, for 4th graders who are too young to be seeing this. Is having a black President not inspiration enough? Several black Supreme Court justices?
2297 2018-02-17 18:00:09 dont buy silver like I am without proper advice, I am protecting my money against an economic breakdown (imminent) and future losses against stock market crash. next month China will start trading crude oil in yuan which will mean what to the #petrodollar? Interest rates to hike?
2298 2018-02-17 18:00:07 Question  Where do you see the oil and gas industry in 5 years time?
2299 2018-02-17 18:00:05 Under Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, inaugurated Public Toilet with the help of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
2300 2018-02-17 17:59:57 Maybe we should reframe “anti-climate” to “pro fossil fuel” agenda. 

I no longer buy any story of denialism by any politician. They are just being paid to be pro oil just like they’re being paid to be pro guns.
2301 2018-02-17 17:59:51 It doesn’t matter the state in which I return home at night, I’ll be damned if I don’t turn on my ocean sound machine & put 8 drops of lavender oil in my diffuser
2302 2018-02-17 17:59:43 It's a goat/sheep milk feta marinated in herb infused oil. A friend of ours got it to bring to a game day where the hosts made lamb pizza with this cheese and pomegranate balsamic glaze.

In 1951 Mosaddegh was democratically elected PM but he wanted Iran to control Irans oil not BP. 
So we back a coup so BP can have its oil.  
Yup "Good cause"

2379 2018-02-17 17:58:01 Midas does the same thing. I don’t think they make any money off the oil change so that’s why they tell you your car might blow up if you don’t get whatever fixed
2380 2018-02-17 17:57:21 They keep moving the goal post. First it was the coming ice age, then global warming, then climate change (which actually does exist), running out of oil by 1995, polar ice cap should already have melted, NYC should be submerged....talk about hoaxes
2381 2018-02-17 17:57:15 Hiii again. I’m covered head to toe in oil and I just filmed 3 vids! Doing my best to be productive 
2382 2018-02-17 17:57:10 Oh dear another gloryhunter who thinks the history of football started in 1992. Put your hummus dip down and ask yer da or one of your uncle's. Take your oil baron owners away and you'd be back where you belong celebrating avoiding relegation or in the championship.
2383 2018-02-17 17:57:08 He doI’m fina take this castor oil on his ass
2384 2018-02-17 17:57:03 @dutchsinse Submarine oil fields, the North Sea oil fields. I guess another area' result is a sea-bed mining too.
2385 2018-02-17 17:57:03 I was supposed to get my oil changed today. I’m praying on it.
2386 2018-02-17 17:56:53 We shouldn’t ignore the role of money & oil in this story. Fossil fuel economy is going down & certain entities will fight for Every. Last. Drop. they get to BURN. They want that oil out of the arctic & ready to burn ASAP.

Yes I have the same problem with an out door workshop being my garage, you can keep things clean with either WD40 or 3in1 oil is good.
2391 2018-02-17 17:56:00 Oil is gold Clive and Bayo is worth his weight in it
2392 2018-02-17 17:55:59 I often just use a primer - but also adding face oil to a foundation will lighten it so it's not a mask like feeling. I use a l'oreal one but Laura Mercier also good.
2393 2018-02-17 17:55:45 sometimes you just need to give yourself time to settle
2394 2018-02-17 17:55:11 Idc y’all tweaking if you putting coconut oil on your face 
2395 2018-02-17 17:55:01 Senators Richard Burr and Thom Tillis wants to drill oil on NC coast! They want to destroy our beautiful state for greedy money in their pockets! Do we want them to stay in Congress?? I say No!!
2396 2018-02-17 17:54:52 As a mechanic, I take offense being compared to LeBron and assuming he could change oil correctly
2397 2018-02-17 17:54:37 My entire body is covered in coconut  oil and it feels heavenly.
2398 2018-02-17 17:54:31 Owned by Rebecca Mercer. Hannan Mr anti fabulous fabulist & Nigella Fromage more Pinochet than Pinotage are regular speakist mouth breathers
Oh yeah stokers of Atlantic free trade exploitation bridge, & big OIL nihilists racing 2ward extinction level event delivered ala #BrexSHit
2399 2018-02-17 17:54:21 Never take too much MCT oil 
2400 2018-02-17 17:54:10 Anybody ever try oil pulling? I'm doing it now for the first time...it's really not so bad.
2401 2018-02-17 17:54:03 I would not be surprised if they are just giving back 1% of what they made off the oil...
2402 2018-02-17 17:53:56 Mike Dean is in the back of the caravan, covered in baby oil, if he doesn’t agree he’s got to sleep in the awning. Gets on my nerves how he bums ‘Macca’
2403 2018-02-17 17:53:51 Deficits to bankrupt the Treasury, spiking interest rates so $2,300 will be paid back to banks on higher interest payments.  25 Cent gas tax to fill a portion of deficit.  Rising oil prices & gas at pump prices aka inflation.  Import tariffs raising prices = no money left over
2404 2018-02-17 17:53:40 No but I really want to. I’ve read about it and I think right now I just don’t know what brands are legit and which are crap. Suggestions? I’m okay with doing the oil.
2405 2018-02-17 17:53:37 Or charge you $103 for a single oil change. #Bye
2406 2018-02-17 17:53:35 تدري ليه لأن فهد ال حركان يختفي كثير لم يجي ع البث تاق الأول 
2407 2018-02-17 17:53:29 She’s an opportunistic show person and snake oil salesman...meet the new Jesse Jackson... #tcot
2408 2018-02-17 17:53:16 #TRIn @Trinity_PLC  keep up the great work team #TRIn , with the price of oil and the $$$ coming in we can pay off government debt, sell west coast asset and pay off the CLNS...keep up the great work Bruce and Jeremy and the #TRIn staff
2409 2018-02-17 17:53:13 @Heid_oil welcome to twitter patient one, quite possibly the only lse poster loved by both sides! #ukog will be delivering shortly #getset
2410 2018-02-17 17:53:12 I have a solution for you, stop eating sugar, drink some lime water and have virgin coconut oil twice a day. That should stop the whatsapp posts :P
2411 2018-02-17 17:53:05 I agree with 99%  of what you say.  However until you’ve been at a Walmart around food assistance time and see what people are buying I think you need to wait to reserve judgment. PB cups, jugs of punch, steaks ,vats of oil...
2412 2018-02-17 17:52:33 mine are always homemade so it’s 2 eggs, a oil that works good on your hair, and any deep conditioner you use. i always use argan, black castor or coconut oil. you just shampoo your hair and use this instead of conditioner. do it twice a month and you should b good
2413 2018-02-17 17:52:20 he believes Russia deserves..he can't throw his weight around economically (He did in the 2000's when oil was high..but Bush took care of that)..He tried to do that militarily (by drawing US in a proxy in Syria..but Obama wasn't playing.).so  cyber it was.. chaos is a weapon
2414 2018-02-17 17:52:08 It was not always as bad as it is now, at least for some. But we are planning on moving far away to a blue state. It has great food, music, culture, and what the oil industry has not killed is beautiful.
2415 2018-02-17 17:52:03 And since this happened, world consumption of oil/gas has grown more rapidly & Canada imports from US. You have accomplished zero/ hurt 
2416 2018-02-17 17:51:57 Your face hasn’t lived until it’s lounged in a bath of blue tansy oil y’all 
2417 2018-02-17 17:51:57 Paid for with oil money, no doubt...
2418 2018-02-17 17:51:42 I wonder how they extract oil from horse 
2419 2018-02-17 17:51:41 So what are the chances of a marine spill from the tankers/oil trains that will be needed to supply the Puget Sound with the crude it needs to keep BC supplied in refined fuels? What will be the effect of those spills 1/
2420 2018-02-17 17:51:38 No oil station. Help.
2421 2018-02-17 17:51:33 Mafuta (Oil) just scored 
2422 2018-02-17 17:51:14 امال يا شيخ امين يادشناوي 
حبيبي @mahmoud_oil 
2423 2018-02-17 17:51:07 Was supposed to take my truck to the dealership for a oil change at 10 and woke up at 11.. ta cabron
2424 2018-02-17 17:51:04 After like 110-120k most DE’s burn oil. Mine after 113k it was burning like crazy, but then again I would always mistreat the hell out of it
2425 2018-02-17 17:51:01 Oil is not being subsidized because all the extra excise collected is being used to improve Indian refineries which will in due time improve the quality of petrol and diesel we get automatically reducing fuel cost in the mean time also acquiring rights in UAE.
2426 2018-02-17 17:50:41 مثلك والله
2427 2018-02-17 17:50:36 It's time for @ScottPruittOK to go! His travel at the taxpayers expense is most likely to meet with gas and oil. He has no interest in protecting our environment. #PollutingPruitt
2428 2018-02-17 17:50:29 Why is it everything costs $50 though? Spray tan? $50. Nails? $50. Waxing? $50. Lash refill? $50. Oh you need an oil change? $50.
2429 2018-02-17 17:50:17 Mighty Mouse was going to use water to put out an oil fire. 

Moron.
2430 2018-02-17 17:50:09 Essential oils do not fix chemical imbalances please stop telling me to start rubbing lavender oil on my wrists to feel better
2431 2018-02-17 17:50:06 The jak ini mental kampung emang. Paling bener emang ga usah make3 GBK.
2432 2018-02-17 17:50:04 For the lips of an evil woman are as sweet as honey & her mouth is smoother than oil. But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as dangerous as a double-edged sword. Proverbs 5:3-4
2433 2018-02-17 17:49:55 Have you tried peppermint oil? I had a chronic headache for over a year & it was the only thing that helped.
2434 2018-02-17 17:49:44 Sitting in a cafe, drinking cbd oil infused coffee, hanging out with kid who is learning hieroglyphics while her mom hoops to music.. 
2435 2018-02-17 17:49:44 Hahaha. Niantic said to walk the BUDDY, not specifically a DOG! LOL @trnrtips
2436 2018-02-17 17:49:38 History of the wars proves it. WW1& b4 was 4 capturing LAND & disintegrate MUSLIM WORLD. WW2 was 2 become SUPER POWERS, DOMINATION of OCEANS ROUTES & OIL REGIONS. MARSHALL PLAN was 2 undo COMMUNISM, retain pacific RIM, reduce BRITISH & FRANCE power. Future WARS. 4 SPACE & WATER
2437 2018-02-17 17:49:17 
2438 2018-02-17 17:49:11 My psoriasis is really kicking my ass at the moment. So much coconut oil it’s ridiculous. More stress free sunny days required!
2439 2018-02-17 17:49:00 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

＼It's OIL!!!／
2440 2018-02-17 17:48:44 Russia is out to grab control of the global economy and sink the US...oil undoubtedly plays a role.
2441 2018-02-17 17:48:44 I'm about to oil my entire body up and lay in the middle of the road lol
2442 2018-02-17 17:48:38 Had work till 11 pm just now, gonna burn the midnight oil.... Probably till morning and work starts at 830am later hah goodluck to me
2443 2018-02-17 17:48:31 Risk assessment means looking at risks versus benefits. It involves comparing risks to the alternatives. These are things the activists are careful never to do. You cannot look at the risk of an oil spill without considering the risks of the alternatives 2/
2444 2018-02-17 17:48:18 "SPY Igor Melekh, Jimmy HOFFA, organized crime figure FRANK COSTELLO, oil commodity trader Marc Rich, U.S. SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY, corporate raider Victor POSNER, Michael MILIKEN, the Washington Post newspaper and the Reverend Sun Myung Moon".

I SMALL DIRTY AS SHIT
2445 2018-02-17 17:48:15 They did push it further away from shore, over the Horizon. Tourist don't like seeing oil rigs either. BP even named the rig that ended up blowing Deep Water Horizon. Maybe a coincidence.
2446 2018-02-17 17:47:51 You're darker than Akon talking bout you're mixed... With what? Oil and dirt?
2447 2018-02-17 17:47:47 Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts -Ps. 139:23.  We get check ups, oil changes, haircuts, but forget to do periodic and intentional spiritual inspections. This is how decease grows.
2448 2018-02-17 17:47:30 ‘Return periods’ are very misleading when it comes to conveying marine oil spill risks, as the #NorthernGateway debate revealed. Percentage chances over the lifespan of the project are a much better indicator, especially for public consumption.
2449 2018-02-17 17:47:07 Cannabis oil for cancer & pain relief is in demand locally & abroad - legalize it!
2450 2018-02-17 17:46:52 Oh yes.... the good old boys were celebrating with trump when he won.   And look at all the red carpets trump has rolled out for oil.......

Not to mention,  industry competitive with big oil has gotten hit hard on many fronts.   Not just solar
2451 2018-02-17 17:46:46 Then we’re about to blow an engine; we’re running dry and hot, no oil, no coolant.
2452 2018-02-17 17:46:43 The Canadian oil & gas industry that she despises has restricted travel massively in recent years, in favour of teleconferencing, between Calgary and Fort McMurray, Edmonton even

Hypocrisy Minister @cathmckenna should try it
2453 2018-02-17 17:46:40 Doesn't help with Iraq and the Kurd thing with oil now flowing to Russia?
2454 2018-02-17 17:46:34 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
2455 2018-02-17 17:46:29 ...You know it’s a vibe when the theater smells like coconut oil.
2456 2018-02-17 17:46:16 OMG how long do we have to listen to this guy selling his snake  oil?! 
2457 2018-02-17 17:46:08 Either way, it's a sugar-based stain, not an oil one so that does make things a bit easier.
2458 2018-02-17 17:45:46 Combine 3 pints grapes with 8 oz enchilada. Blend with Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve the next morning for breakfast.
2459 2018-02-17 17:45:45 
2460 2018-02-17 17:45:36 I believe you can use garlic or onion infused oil because the bad-FODMAPPY bit isn't in the oil... But I am not a FODMAPper, just a close friend of someone who did this under dietitician advice and is a stickler for 'medical' rules.

Friend also bought specialist low-FODMAP foods
2461 2018-02-17 17:45:26 YES we are open for right now!! Not raining ! Come get your car washed and an oil change!!
2462 2018-02-17 17:45:21 めこしライブ楽しかったぞ！！ #らぶらとLV1
2463 2018-02-17 17:45:08 Get out of that Barbie world. We need oil to live. Day to day. No one can afford electric bills and electric cars in the middle class. Come on now. Green energy has cost Ontario billions. We only have poisoned water wells+Liberal corruption to show for it.
2464 2018-02-17 17:45:07 Ladies! Toss that coconut oil out! Start using jojoba oil on your skin when you get out of hay bath or shower. Trust me, you’ll fall in soft silky love!!
2465 2018-02-17 17:45:01 We found ginger tea was good for nausea. Take own blanket to chemo sessions for warmth & comfort. Skin dries & nails may crack during chemo: a good non-paraben moisturiser will be useful, or sweet almond oil. Seasalt do great headscarves: v soft cotton. Good luck with everything.
2466 2018-02-17 17:45:00 I hope that Mueller’s investigation includes the wealthy GOP donors who obviously would benefit from a weakened US government (libertarian) or even a fascist US government. The common denominator in all this corruption is multinational oil & gas companies. Follow the oil drips.
2467 2018-02-17 17:44:57 And Mr. Pence What Is The Take On Pay For Hunt Oil & Jimmy Jones Dallas Cowboys!! Sad !! Pence Tell the truth! The Massive Tax Cut Were For The Upper 1% & For Corporations! The Leftovers were For TheOther 99% Of Americans!Sad!!
2468 2018-02-17 17:44:47 Have you been hiding under a rock or something,she's against oil developers until she has to fuel her suv or turn up the heat in her house,she's been a protester against oil forever along with berman and the other traitors against Canada ,Asia will get oil and natgas just from US
2469 2018-02-17 17:44:43 Now we know Who is stealing the money from IRAQ! ABADI,  ALAQ AND SON, the IMF w/ This bullship 2%. IRAQ NEEDS TO BE INVADED BY ALL NATIONS THEY STOLE MONEY FROM! TAKE OIL as PAYMENT.
2470 2018-02-17 17:44:42 Heat gel, ice packs, boiling baths, Epsom salts, CBD oil and CBD tablets, celecoxib, zapain, nothing is working!
2471 2018-02-17 17:44:32 Hell Na cuz. That’s when they start burning oil. And 6.5k?! I’ve seen them for like 3-5k wouldn’t do it if I were you
2472 2018-02-17 17:44:27 0. Drink dat water

1. CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser

2. AM: Stridex Red (BHA), Mizon 8% AHA Serum 1x/wk

3. CeraVe PM Moisturizer

4. AM: Biore UV Aqua Rich SPF50+/PA++++

that’s it. if i could change anything I’d add some mineral oil as step 0.5
2473 2018-02-17 17:44:20 He and Keaton were awesome in this one. The oil scene was great.
2474 2018-02-17 17:44:13 Eggs, egg shell, n little bit of chicken with salmon oil.
2475 2018-02-17 17:43:57 You know adulting feels good when you gotta pay your car, tags and your car needs an oil change all in 2 days and don’t gotta ask mommy and daddy to pay for shit cause you got yourself and ain’t stressin over the money
2476 2018-02-17 17:43:54 And picking a oil slick as Secretary of State is arrogant and insincere, politically speaking.
2477 2018-02-17 17:43:43 @BlairKing_ca #TransMountain You do yourself a disservice by essentially branding anyone who disagrees with you as an ‘activist’. Surely there is room for legitimate debate on the topic of marine oil spill risks- DilBit in particular.
2478 2018-02-17 17:43:31 While we have no regulations on possessing or transporting marijuana products, including CBD oil, possession is a crime under federal law. Our officers aren't looking for illegal narcotics, but they have to report them to law enforcement when discovered.
2479 2018-02-17 17:43:28 All these out of towners for oil and gas keep asking why don’t we use sand bags  bcs the mountains stack the water up sand bags will not help
2480 2018-02-17 17:43:11 "The grooviest and phoniest things in the world cannot be ingested or even pursued - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2481 2018-02-17 17:43:11 Were you to disturb an oil derrick your ensorcelled blade would be of little use, to the detriment of all and sundry.
2482 2018-02-17 17:43:08 Just remember without sanctions Exxon can go ahead with that huge deal w Russian Oil!
2483 2018-02-17 17:42:56 Fries fresh out the fryer ain’t even good. All you taste is potato and hot ass oil.
2484 2018-02-17 17:42:54 its @ 1% and i gotta wait for my sister to get her oil changed

2488 2018-02-17 17:42:09 Can't Sleep? Apply some lavender oil to your temples to help you relax and fall asleep.
2489 2018-02-17 17:41:43 Fries are still good warmed up if you put them on a stove-top pan with a LIIIIIIIIL bit of oil.
2490 2018-02-17 17:41:25 If de gea eventually leaves,we must by a keeper,Romero ain't a good bet
2491 2018-02-17 17:41:22 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.
2492 2018-02-17 17:41:20 I am a home cook. I am not a chef. And I live in London. If the coconut cream in a tin is shit ( emulsifiers are us), I fry curry paste in oil .It is not a sin and it certainly does the trick. #homecooking #chill
2493 2018-02-17 17:41:18 took my car to get the oil changed and they washed the outside of my car and it hasn’t been this clean in months, i wasn’t 100% sure it was mine
2494 2018-02-17 17:41:13 I need some cucumber  & olive oil ... it cures everything bags & saggy titties lol
2495 2018-02-17 17:41:06 Switzerland has a really high gun ownership, and almost NO gun related crime. I think the problem in the US is twofold, psychiatric drugs, and our never ending assault on other countries for Regime Change and Oil. Kids see that and think... I'll be like that...
2496 2018-02-17 17:41:00 Fact - #Alberta is landlocked! As long as there are liberals and NDP #Alberta will have no international sea port to give our oil access to the world. #KinderMorgan only supplies BC and Washington. We need a plan B for Alberta. #yyc #yeg #calgary
2497 2018-02-17 17:40:45 Good! It's about time. THIS high functioning Asperger has filed a federal lawsuit demanding religious freedom to use the buds of cannabis for making the Holy oil of Christ. Christ commanded his disciples to give the holy oil to the sick. It is a requirement of my faith to do so.
2498 2018-02-17 17:40:44 @ArrigoPalmBeach your service department is out of gas. 2.5 for a quick oil change #stillwaiting #nevercomingback
2499 2018-02-17 17:40:41 That's why I do not go to them.  It's painful to listen to the sales pitch. Just change my damn oil! !
2500 2018-02-17 17:40:39 I'm pretty sure this Car Care place has been fucking with my car every time I got an oil change. Im able to physically push my windshield out with ease and the fabric on the inside is messed up by the windshield, which wasn't like that before.
2501 2018-02-17 17:40:29 Subject to a little freezing point depression due to presence of almond oil, but would assume if you can remove the requisite enthalpy of fusion, it will freeze just fine!
2502 2018-02-17 17:40:21 Given the Russian economy is built largely on oil, I'm surprised no one looked into this sooner
2503 2018-02-17 17:40:21 でもウルフってちょっとカッコいいよなーあっいや一番カッコいいのはハンターだけどな！
2504 2018-02-17 17:40:20 Oh yeah more shale oil? “Syria also has oil shale resources with estimated reserves that range as high as 50 billion tons, according to a Syrian government source in 2010.”
2505 2018-02-17 17:40:14 Oil painting? Looks similar to Van Gogh technique!
2506 2018-02-17 17:40:13 What are you on about? Are you saying the UK has no natural resources of its own? Doesn't coal, oil, natural gas, limestone, chalk, gypsum, silica, rock salt, china clay, iron ore, tin, silver, gold or lead count in your book. Just stop now before you embarrass yourself further.

2510 2018-02-17 17:39:48 Both myself and @jthavest are brand ambassadors for #snakeoil   Rather than get it ordered on line and pay for it, we now both use #virtual snake oil, which you can just download.  Works as well as the leading brands.
2511 2018-02-17 17:39:36 Adhu oru Madurai based sme oil company... 2012 la form pannanga.. check it
2512 2018-02-17 17:39:17 Typical class bias by Dhume. So PM should only talk about selling tea and pressing oil? No life experiences carryover? Per this logic every parent should pass every exam that their kids appear for before even wishing them good luck.
2513 2018-02-17 17:39:12 One last shale oil rush, that's all I keep hearing, one last push to make that nest egg. This pipeline is crucial for world stability as we push for a renewable revolution. We've reached the limit of hydraulic fracking and dirty shale is the last veign of gold left.
2514 2018-02-17 17:39:12 Homaygaaasssh! Effective ata yung castor oil? Enebeee? Imagination ko lang ba to or talagang effective siya? Hahaha
2515 2018-02-17 17:38:59 Things to do when it’s not any #FPL.

2521 2018-02-17 17:38:15 potus worked w/ russia in ac, nj. laundered rus mob $$$ w/ casinos et al., he will lift intl  sanctions, make rus oil viable, clear whatever he owes russia
2522 2018-02-17 17:38:13 Now that we have oil gushing out of every corner of the U.S. maybe we can stop "killing all the brown people".  I don't get Dems...don't want energy independence, which would prevent us "having to" be involved in so many other nations' business.  I guess...who knows...
2523 2018-02-17 17:38:05 No nation wants to help a shithole nation where a program rate is KING and alaq and son STEALS 40 million and open a salon in Ottawa with stolen funds. FUCK IRAQ, ABADI, ALAQ! 2ALL NATIONS "STOP SUPPORTING THESE PPL WHO ALL THEY DO IS STEAL!! INVADE IRAQ AND TAKE THE OIL!
2524 2018-02-17 17:38:03 Hmmm,, for 16 years a formidable party like PDP, the biggest in Africa with all the oil fortunes at its disposal failed to fix infrastructure, failed to empower the youths, failed to buoy the economy to resist recession! The party lacked internal democracy which led to its defeat
2525 2018-02-17 17:37:51 Oh gracious we were just talking about this, too. :) I would SO watch this show. I would volunteer to be the person to teach how to change your car’s oil or how to not let ppl overcharge for things your car doesn’t need... do a toolbox makeover... I LOVE THIS.
2526 2018-02-17 17:37:40 I get weird pro oil industry tweets. I made fun of some of them and I guess that makes the twitter algorithm think I need more of them.
2527 2018-02-17 17:37:39 Success of SpaceX Falcon Heavy is something that especially a colossal capitalist such as Comrade Stalin would recognize shows the merits of small scale capitalist-adventurers. Stalin used the Harrimans, US railroad baron plutocratic heirs to develop Baku offshore oil, inter alia

2532 2018-02-17 17:37:09 Trump is apolitical, he has no core beliefs or values that identify him. Trump is a modern day snake oil salesman, selling the next miracle cure. He is always selling and looking for people who are willing to buy. A con man like Trump has no political allegiances.
2533 2018-02-17 17:37:03 Senan Molony's response in verse to the Sligo announcement in today's @irishdailymail is entitled The Snake Oil of Innisfree!
2534 2018-02-17 17:36:53 Obama is a shapeshifting reptile and a reptile cannot be an American citizen!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2535 2018-02-17 17:36:40 but why is this oil change taking so long..
2536 2018-02-17 17:36:27 The fact that a tweet could be considered, at all, to not be patriotic is the moment you realize they pay ppl to tweet the patriotic crap. And if youre one of them not getn paid, youre a stooge for oil and gunpowder. The usa is dead. Its not ours anymore. Move on now.
2537 2018-02-17 17:36:26 #umitenotKnow Before a shepherd leads his sheep into a new, green field, he spreads oil over each sheep's head—in a sense he "anoints" them with oil, part of protection against vipers #nutshellsermon
2538 2018-02-17 17:36:22 That’s his opinion. He isn’t running for office. Now what is your opinion on the oil sands? What is your vision for the future of Alberta?
2539 2018-02-17 17:36:18 A good start for criteria to judge our pols is NO contributions from Big Oil, Pharma, and the banksters.  I'll probably add more culprits later on.
2540 2018-02-17 17:36:13 I'm so annoyed by beauty videos w/ people who have skin on the dryer side. Their complexions usually are super even. Pores on shrunk. I'm just here looking like canola oil+dark spots+breakouts. But, hey, less future wrinkles?

2554 2018-02-17 17:34:15 I imagine it's because in 1910 there was no real Oil Industry the way we have now and the only way people could relate to this amazing resources was to call it tar. We have since learned to produce oil from it. Time to upgrade the language. Progress, you know...

2572 2018-02-17 17:32:47 @qvcuk @QVC what a ripoff selling Lakeland Orange Oil Wood Furniture Polish 500ml for £15 plus p&p when it's only £6.99 in its own shop #ripoff #con
2573 2018-02-17 17:32:40 As does N Korea. Our nation needs more cyber security. Worried about power plants, banking, oil platforms, false alerts, etc
2574 2018-02-17 17:32:22 Why is foolish India giving a platform to the Iranians to criticize USA? Didn't Iran backstab India by not giving favorable rights on Chabahar, inviting China to enter Chabahar, reneging on Farzad-B oil fields? Dont trust Iran! You can forget UNSC if countries like Iran back you!
2575 2018-02-17 17:32:15 It's so expensive . I hope castor oil helps.

2578 2018-02-17 17:32:03 Unfortunate that positive news are generally ignored by most TV channels. Iranian President Rouhani is on India visit. 9 bilateral agreements covering oil,gas,port etc took place between Iran & India. Canadian President Justin Trudeau arrived in,India on 7 days visit.
2579 2018-02-17 17:31:50 Double yikes! Is there any oil off shore drilling or any fracking out there? The midwest US traditionally doesnt have earth quakes. They started fracking years back and now they have the shakes weekely. Almost like we are removing the earth's sliding lube, lol
2580 2018-02-17 17:31:49 Paprika potato is the easiest meal ever. You make some diced onion glassy on some oil, add some sausage slices and good amount red pepper, mix and cook a bit to get the sausage a bit crispy. Then add sliced potatoes and water, some salt. Cook till the potato is soft.

2586 2018-02-17 17:30:46 Lots of Democrats would get an A from profracking/pro-pipeline oil companies, the military industrial complex and big pharma and health insurance corporations. The NRA is one more corporation that both Republicans and Democrats bow to.

2596 2018-02-17 17:29:37 It’ll feel like that at first but that’s cuz they’re actually hitting the right spots and numbing won’t heal it holistic therapy and oil massages are some of the best healings

2598 2018-02-17 17:29:22 ARE YOU SERIOUS!! He's a Putin. He's involved with the RU Sanctions. He/Putin were 2 drill oil &make billions. Putin was going to receive 19%  The Sanctions didn't allow them 2 go thru with it. Rex got rid of the dept that handled the Sanctions. Recently found a way 2 make money
2599 2018-02-17 17:29:22 My thought with my old bike, but I just got my new bike 2 weeks ago and it's cable froze up too. I'm going to try and get some oil down the cable. I seem to have better luck if I keep shifting.
2600 2018-02-17 17:29:10 Well that's the thing the trumpers seem to fail to realize.    

Just the fact that they wanted trump is one big,  red Russian flag.   Even more of a flag is the involvement of Big Oil.
2601 2018-02-17 17:29:09 I wanna take a bath w lavender essential oil & flower petals just for the feels.
2602 2018-02-17 17:29:07 They spent like 30b on oil & gas businesses which today are worth half as much as they paid.  If you can get in at 12x $1 eps, you’ll do well.
2603 2018-02-17 17:28:54 Question. If you are on CBD oil do you have to tell your doctor and would you have to tell PIP that you use it for pain control or would it go against you? I’m not on it was just wondering.
2604 2018-02-17 17:28:53 Will there be oil or Jell-O involved?
2605 2018-02-17 17:28:36 Hate waiting for oil changes 
2606 2018-02-17 17:28:31 Getting that annual tune up under the hood with a complimentary oil change. 
2607 2018-02-17 17:28:30 Creo q seria como q al valer menos el dolar se necesitan mas dolares para comprar la misma cantidad de commodities y por eso suben sus precios. Los republicanos gralmte. depresian el dolar por lo q se espera suba de oil (al menos x ese lado)

2623 2018-02-17 17:25:41 @BlairKing_ca Your basic point is that DilBit spills are no worse than heavy crude oil spills. If you’re right, we can expect that about 10-15 % of a #TransMountain tanker spill would be cleaned up. You yourself say the effects of a spill of either product could be catastrophic.

2628 2018-02-17 17:24:49 Just read about Advanced Glycation Endproducts , then delete carbs from you shopping. Add plenty of nuts, oil, cream, avocado. Continue that for six months minimum, except on weekends. Make your body re-learn how to make do with only fat for energy. Burn on all cylinders.

2634 2018-02-17 17:24:03 LIght tight oil (LTO) is the definition that is probably better than shale. It is in general the non-conventional oil that is produced in Permian, eagle ford, etc. It is the oil before it is blended into WTI and typically has an API between 40 and 60

2653 2018-02-17 17:21:40 i'm not even sure anymore if i actually am less depressed or if it's all the lavender oil at work.
2654 2018-02-17 17:21:17 Steve I’d like you to get in touch with me some how I have some possible big opportunities for your besafe ap in the oil & gas industry
2655 2018-02-17 17:21:10 That's far less that the 'industry' pays for similar speakers to promote oil expansion. Would you have the same problem if this were an oil lobbyist instead?
2656 2018-02-17 17:21:09 Besides hittin the barbershop and getting my oil changed .  I might shoot out towards your way . Wassup
2657 2018-02-17 17:20:51 i have the sweetest bf ever he is taking my car to get the oil changed for me

2662 2018-02-17 17:20:38 Follow the money, good guess, favours in wage negotiations with the left and maybe pension fund investments don’t want want competition from the oil sands, so could that be? Consider the Texas oil, east coast suppliers, Montreal refiners. Is there any sense questioning principles
2663 2018-02-17 17:20:17 Yes Ahneeka palm oil and sugar great remedy for cough.

2670 2018-02-17 17:19:53 Can I help you film the nude oil wrestling scene?
2671 2018-02-17 17:19:52 They used oil money to prepare for when oil runs out. Look at their airlines instead of selling  cheap fuel they put it in their planes and rip you twice, their country is reroute destination you. Departure fees, plus you buy something their economy booms
2672 2018-02-17 17:19:50 Rex, did you try to speak with Turks in the streets, and noticed that they are arrested afterwards - Rex in my eyes you FAIL as your eyes are linked to Oil&Gas $$$$ only.
2673 2018-02-17 17:19:44 Bro.....simmer. They may pop olives and REALLY get pissed then we’ll have Greek olive oil all over the place and they can claim that too.

2677 2018-02-17 17:19:26 Recalling policies he espoused when he ran vs. Obama & his infamous 47% speech. He regarded half the nation as lazy victims, wanted to privatize & corporatize everything, wants to open public lands to oil. He's not an indecent person. But his policies square w/ current DC GOP.
2678 2018-02-17 17:19:15 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
2679 2018-02-17 17:19:11 like find some oil, lighting, and ya angles. If you gon make be block you at least make it worth my while damn.

2683 2018-02-17 17:18:45 Genghis Khan, in their own original record keeping, was said to have skin black as oil. A lot of their early paintings show black men holding higher ranks in military. There are statues african women made of pure gold. They were all moved to the Smithsonian or the World Library.
2684 2018-02-17 17:18:41 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
2685 2018-02-17 17:18:38 let me guess you have to wash your back hair after going to the toilet, learn some history before you accuse a anti capitalist anti imperialist of being a puppet of the USA hes not a moronic Turkish Jihadist working to get america cheap oil and bring about greater Israel
2686 2018-02-17 17:18:36 @BlairKing_ca Your basic point seems to be that DilBit spills in the marine environment R no worse than heavy crude oil spills. As an On Scene Commander for marine oil spill response, I take no comfort in that: The average encounter rate for crude oil spill response is c. 10-15%!
2687 2018-02-17 17:18:34 Trying castor oil on my lashes & brows to see if it really does work , I'll keep you all updated
2688 2018-02-17 17:18:20 So I'm giving up.sugat for a month, I avoid palm oil over environmental concerns and want to avoid unnecessary plastic.  Food shopping is a nightmare!!!
2689 2018-02-17 17:18:18 She can't. She's nuts
2690 2018-02-17 17:18:03 I’m getting my oil changed today. Can’t wait to hear all the other shit wrong with my car 
2691 2018-02-17 17:17:51 I hate when people do that
"wow this cashew nut cream cheese is so good!"
it's a bunch of blended nuts and oil
IT'S NOT CHEESE
2692 2018-02-17 17:17:46 I didn't know that you had these scary quakes. They happen a lot in Oklahoma, people blame the oil industry.  Hope everything is ok.
2693 2018-02-17 17:17:29 Have you thought about holistic healings or oil massages ?
2694 2018-02-17 17:17:00 That is a refinery designed speciifcally to run heavy oil sands and produce diesel. Show me a standard refinery that can turn heavy crude into more than 60% middle distillates. One that balances the low middle distillates from the LTO to produce the quantity required.
2695 2018-02-17 17:16:58 first its the oil on my bike then its the fork seals leakin nowwwwwww its the mf back tire i need a new one  to many burnouts last year it finally split my tire
2696 2018-02-17 17:16:33 The US government is prioritizing the wrong things. Instead of putting taxpayer dollars to protect oil overseas, maybe focusing on protecting public & private schools adequately so that children won’t have to lose their lives or fear going to school.
2697 2018-02-17 17:16:20 BC has had carbon tax for years.... business didn't move. Oil industry in AB welcomed ct.... got another fairy tale?
2698 2018-02-17 17:16:19 Why doesn’t any of the blame lay with PepsiCo? Another multi national company taking jobs away to maximize profit above people. My wife was laid off while on mat leave by multi nat oil co during the last Con gov in AB. NDP to blame?
2699 2018-02-17 17:15:54 PLEASE be careful with using tea tree oil. I know it can be good for a lot of reasons for some people, but some can also have an allergic reaction to it!
2700 2018-02-17 17:15:52 I have two recommendations, the first product is called Butter Glazed Gel Soufflé ( by olive oil) , it gives your curls that definition w/o hardening! The second is Mizani Coconut Soufflé, it has a light hardness to your hair, just Incase you don’t want to use gel at all!
2701 2018-02-17 17:15:40 Yay! It's a beautiful day! Come on down to @ScentedStudio and create your own custom creation! You can make a bath or body product. You can also create an oil for your oil warmer at home and make your house smell fabulous! #amazing #MothersDay #custom #soap
2702 2018-02-17 17:15:39 No more cheap gas . Strictly premium. My car runs soo much better . This oil change is gonna make it even better
2703 2018-02-17 17:15:14 If I were a school official, I’d probably support this. Might not be super safe though- but I think you could convince the cops in some areas to be on board. A protest is necessary, I’m more inclined to hit them in their wallets. National days of not spending$ & conserving oil.
2704 2018-02-17 17:15:10 SICK! Imagine putting a living creature in hot oil. Disgusting x(
2705 2018-02-17 17:15:06 Chavez's nationalisation of Venezuela's oil industry, which is redistributing the country's wealth to the poor, is nothing like Mugabe’s kleptocratic agrarian reform programme that's resulted in millions of Zimbabweans fleeing their country in search of a better life in S Africa.
2706 2018-02-17 17:14:44 hamari sarkar ne OIL COMPANIES ko apne control se bahar kiya taki public se zyada paise vasulne ki baat unpe thopi ja sake, kya vo companies sarkari nahi hain agar hai to phir GST ki baat pe kyon sarkar kamjor pad jati hai,  aur fuel ki price din b din badhte jate hain.
2707 2018-02-17 17:14:44 why does target not offer oil changes?
2708 2018-02-17 17:14:40 Genie Energy Ltd. is an American energy company headquartered in Newark, New Jersey.  It is a holding company comprising Genie Retail Energy, a retail energy  provider in the United States, and Genie Oil and Gas, which is pursuing  a conventional oil project in Israel.

2716 2018-02-17 17:12:55 Yeah! Oil sand is the standardized term. This is so rich from virtue-signaler who has how many homes again???
2717 2018-02-17 17:12:49 I literally JUST applied lavender oil to my temple, wrist, and back of neck to relieve my tension and it really worked! #goodNight
2718 2018-02-17 17:12:45 Congratulations to Naas CBS on their 2-8 to 0-6 victory over Colaiste Eoin in the Top Oil Leinster 'A' schools semi-final today. A brilliant victory!
2719 2018-02-17 17:12:33 So for the same cost I can apparently get a full electric Nissan Leaf instead of a plug-in hybrid 

Take away oil and fluid maintenance and gas and it’s cheaper in the end... main concern is only 240km range.
2720 2018-02-17 17:12:23 Process the sand, out comes tar & oil.

It's okay though, I use your preferred Oilsands term too.  Wouldn't want to hurt your feelings.

2725 2018-02-17 17:11:58 Vitamin E skin oil was probably one of the best things I've done thus far for skin care
2726 2018-02-17 17:11:36 ‘data is an organisations greatest asset’ zzzzz  

‘data is the new oil’ zzzzz  

these tired lines remind me of what the software companies playing catch up said about saas and the cloud 5 years ago. 

keep up.

2732 2018-02-17 17:10:47 NRA doesn't run the country, oil and hospital lobbies are bigger. You cant even tell me what an assault rifle is yet you feel competent enough to type your garbage on twitter. Assault rifles are worth 20,000$ + in the US and require paperwork and fingerprinting to get.
2733 2018-02-17 17:10:38 BC never seems to bring up fact that NE BC is one of the biggest and busiest oil and gas investments right now in , other then oil sands.

2742 2018-02-17 17:10:08 I reviewed his work after this exchange last night. He is very knowledgeable in terms of effects on marine life. I’m sure he’d be the first to tell us that any oil spill would be catastrophic — and it would be. My specific comments were about the bitumen crude difference
2743 2018-02-17 17:10:07 This is the Gunda.. billionaire Arab & ISIS needs fighters to capture Oil field but have no army to challenge Arabian govts. so making India a recruiting centre through Muslim contractors in name of Islamic Jehad. 
Let them go there and commit Suicide.

2744 2018-02-17 17:10:05 yet that is what is bought by Canada to be refined in the East coast refineries at fair market cost not at a discount! not to mention all the oil that comes from Saudi, Nigeria, or USA where none of those countries have a regulation that matches what Alberta has, what a joke! 2/2
2745 2018-02-17 17:10:05 Beetje Straight Edge actie. Moet meteen aan dat nummer van Oil denken.

Thank you @Simpson_Rick for everything,

2748 2018-02-17 17:09:48 I've already demonstrated that it can using the revenue and expenditure figures. It's also created an oil fund due to its expanding oil industry.

2754 2018-02-17 17:08:36 The question is, how much under the table money does Quebec get for buying Saudi oil!
2755 2018-02-17 17:07:54 But I love olive oil.

2759 2018-02-17 17:07:32 When your car is the last car for an oil change at the dealership #madeit! #adulting
2760 2018-02-17 17:07:28 Just dropped my pen and the oil cartridge shattered 
2761 2018-02-17 17:07:14 Also remember that the light oil cannot be processed to produce much more middle distillates but a heavy oil can be run through crackers, Coker’s etc to produce more.
2762 2018-02-17 17:07:09 The future of battery technology
Jim Carroll, Futurist, Trends and Innovation Expert: 10 years from now there will be a shift to the electric vehicle. So, Battery Technology will replace the traditional oil industry.

2763 2018-02-17 17:06:56 then chose to live with out oil....see how that works out..and until u get 50%plus1 dont dictate
2764 2018-02-17 17:06:41 I’m feeling you on that one LHM...Have actually taken up real “juggling” to relieve the stress...Praying for an early Spring...those oil bills are no joke!
2765 2018-02-17 17:06:38 Tell me about it! I go in just for an oil change not four hundred different things
2766 2018-02-17 17:06:28 เหนื่อยทากๆอิเวง เหมือนกูเป็นคนใช้ เฮ้อ
2767 2018-02-17 17:06:28 I never go to oil change places. Not after a friend of mine destroyed the engine in a Mercedes because the place didn't tighten the filter.

I just stick a hose down the dipstick. MittyVac sucks the oil out while I change the filter and gasket. Hands don't even get dirty.
2768 2018-02-17 17:06:26 I’m about to pay 30 bucks more for an oil change cause Walmart still didn’t have my filter wtf man
2769 2018-02-17 17:06:22 Or just maybe Mad Maxine it’s to make America less dependent on foreign oil . My question is why would you be against that. ?
2770 2018-02-17 17:06:18 Sturgeon is turning oil sands to diesel. The question of whether this is 'enough' is a market question not an engineering question.
2771 2018-02-17 17:06:17 I agree it is really important to document these important reminders of former times and to share those images widely.
The Middle East wars are obviously about oil and resources. But they are also aimed at destroying these sites, and the Coptic Christian people. 
Don't let them.
2772 2018-02-17 17:06:14 Somehow I managed to do dishes, put clothes away, make a smoothie, get a oil change, go to the gym and get gas all before noon. #earlybird
2773 2018-02-17 17:06:03 Ouch. Haven’t been on my bike since last summer my thighs are burning like crazy.  Dropped the truck off for an oil change biked home.
2774 2018-02-17 17:05:46 It actually doesn't add up. They get less than $20 billion is transfer payments but spend an extra $25 billion for not using Alberta Oil so they are still $5 Billion out. $5 Billion in Vet pockets would look very good and then Trudeau could stop saying stupid things.

2783 2018-02-17 17:04:54 The fault of the Syrians is that they have oil! Nothing else... They want your resources!!!
2784 2018-02-17 17:04:44 Re’d up on my coconut oil 
2785 2018-02-17 17:04:43 Sesame oil may be a good substitute. It has a smoky flavor. Or half Earth Balance, half sesame oil.
2786 2018-02-17 17:04:41 Haha. Venezuela was the jewel in South American crown. They had more oil than any  other country in the world , and they blew the lot. Thats socialism for you. Blow the lot then try to get other people’s money. 
2787 2018-02-17 17:04:38 Loving some of.the prose in your commentary. Especially liked your description of Bayo 'turning like an old oil tanker' ( not sure Bayo will be so pleased though) @bluntphil
2788 2018-02-17 17:04:37 What happened to doing in approving whatever congress brought to the table. You snake oil ConMan piece of crap
2789 2018-02-17 17:04:35 If anyone tries to tell me olive oil is not good for u. I ignore them. Olive oil is medicine.  But only the real, not the generic fake shit.
2790 2018-02-17 17:04:28 Thats why its going to Asia, and we are bringing in Tankers full of oil on East Coast. Nobody seems worried about those tankers. We love our clean water and air, but realize we are part of a counrty, and cant be selfish, for the greater good of rest country, oil has to come in.

2796 2018-02-17 17:03:30 Seems for the 1st hundred years of confederation Ont & Qué sent money to Alberta. No-one billed Alberta, we helped. That’s what being part of federal state is all about. Don’t be so certain Alberta will always be so wealthy. What happens when oil’s depleted? #checkbookfederalism
2797 2018-02-17 17:03:28 I mean HELLO. What did the ant  ever do to deserve THAT monstrosity???

2804 2018-02-17 17:02:43 Oh, wait a minute, I have found out: although bashing Hungary is a sweet sport for such "philantropes" as Soros, but not sufficiently big business neither for the oil/gas companies, nor the financial corporations, not to mention the almighty military-security-industrial complex.
2805 2018-02-17 17:02:35 Tyb ba2a try this .. a facial and body scrub .. instead of throwing the coffee grinds after I make my espresso I mix it with a spoon of honey and coconut oil .. omg !

2812 2018-02-17 17:01:47 There is a oil well in Caldwell that is decorated to look like a killer whale. It looks like Shamoo is swimming as it oscillates up and down. That is the kind of Texas humor I can appreciate.
2813 2018-02-17 17:01:40 Love this oil it’s actually cleared up my dermatitis on my hands after 5 years of suffering  with cracked dry hands
2814 2018-02-17 17:01:38 1. Baby from a Turk 2. The uk  chips in but will no doubt tighten its foreign aid and EU contributions 3. What have Turks given them from their own purse strings? A share of the £ from the oil they bought from ISIS?
2815 2018-02-17 17:01:36 Somebody put me on some good beard oil
2816 2018-02-17 17:01:35 Alberta has a problem with abandoned oil wells,  cleanup costs for bankrupt private companies have been left to government. Money would be better used for health and education, the model of privatizing profit and socializing cost to taxpayer also Canadian

Body: Enjoy your sore throat, a cough to inflict pain upon the throat,  a forever running nose, the outer layer of your skin turned to oil, and if you try to wash away the oil you'll become nauseous.
2819 2018-02-17 17:01:18 Primaries are coming up.

2824 2018-02-17 17:00:37 It costs Eastern Canada an additional $25 billion dollars to import oil at world prices instead of using cheaper Alberta Oil. And that world oil comes in by tanker. It's insanity. $25 Billion would go a long way to provide injured Vets with far more than they ask for.
2825 2018-02-17 17:00:32 02/17: Cheese board Style Margherita! Crushed tomato, local Belfiore fresh mozzarella, garlic olive oil, parsley, oregano
2826 2018-02-17 17:00:27 Getting my oil changed and these kids in here are so annoying their own mom left.
2827 2018-02-17 17:00:24 The little place I get my oil changed doesn’t do appointments it’s just “first come first serve” but they always come through for me when I call & get me right in when I pull up. 
2828 2018-02-17 17:00:24 This is a real threat. It would make it impossible for Russia to repatriate $$ from oil sales. This is what is bringing down Iranian economy. Moving $$ around the payments system is expensive, slow and the quantums moved small.
2829 2018-02-17 17:00:23 おーまだ起きてたのかー作業か？無理するなよ？

2831 2018-02-17 17:00:08 Just realised I haven’t drank coffee in the longest time and I need energy to burn the midnight oil but I’m lazy
2832 2018-02-17 17:00:04 A temporary fix... 
1)boil water. 
2)Pour it in a bowl.
3) pour a few drops of eucalyptus oil in the water
4) put your face over the steam 

2833 2018-02-17 17:00:01 I'm going with @Five_Guys Burgers. Fried in peanut oil + adding the Cajun spice makes it awesome.
2834 2018-02-17 16:59:59 The core of it was playing all of MIDNIGHT ORGAN FIGHT in order -  but they also played Living in Color, Wish I Was Sober, Holy, Woodpile and Oil slick in encore - a couple more I’m forgetting. It was gorgeous.
2835 2018-02-17 16:59:26 Until the cat knocks over your oil and it goes flying everywhere...lost half the bottle 
2836 2018-02-17 16:59:25 Lavender essential oil. A few drops on your pillow or in your shower or rub on your temples. Has helped me in the past.
2837 2018-02-17 16:59:13 Oil change today. Can’t browse the lot because salesmen.

2840 2018-02-17 16:58:35 Jamaican castor oil conditioner by Shae moisture is also lit
2841 2018-02-17 16:58:27 Yes, but they supported donald trump , the gop. There is also russian money in the nra.  Many policy of the gop support an oligarchy.  
The russians have a lot of oil, the gop supports big oil.

2843 2018-02-17 16:58:13 Dems and common sense mix as oil and water.
2844 2018-02-17 16:58:08 then scrape it then put oil on xx
2845 2018-02-17 16:58:06 What the hell do you matter you don't because instead of protecting endangered species you're willing to sell off public land made by president Teddy Roosevelt to the oil and gas industry what do you think that is going to do to the ecosystems and these parks
2846 2018-02-17 16:58:05 And, it definately happens.  Look at the oil and gas industry for example.
2847 2018-02-17 16:58:04 Have you ever tried them roasted in the oven with olive oil, salt, and pepper? I actually really like them They are healthy for you 
2848 2018-02-17 16:57:59 not much went over my car because it went onto of my new coat  but use wax pot remover and baby oil or put a hairdryer on it
2849 2018-02-17 16:57:58 If you're ever thinking about making it, try lightly frying the green onions in the oil
2850 2018-02-17 16:57:55 Just Albertans who only know and think about oil, like they can’t think outside the drum
2851 2018-02-17 16:57:50 @tomcolicchio Thank you for your appearance on #AMJoy with @JoyAnnReid and @RevDrBarber. As a disabled man who cannot shop in grocery stores and receives too much SSDI support for SNAP (I live in a house), I struggle with juggling among food, meds and heating oil.
2852 2018-02-17 16:57:37 Those oil rigs are a real eyesore
2853 2018-02-17 16:57:35 Try using coconut oil as a natural make up remover .. magic
2854 2018-02-17 16:57:29 I guess those refiners turning oil sands into diesel are fake news?
2855 2018-02-17 16:56:42 Or as I like to say, Google is your friend. Suzuki is a snake oil salesman and hypocritical anti-oil evangelist, terms for which, again, you may find Google particularly helpful.
2856 2018-02-17 16:56:39 My baby is getting an oil change, new wipers, a new air filter and is getting fixed today:')

2862 2018-02-17 16:55:53 Your  “national climate plan” is a joke until you  clean up the atrocity that is the tar sands. Your Prov cannot even deal with the orphan oil wells that the oil companies have left polluting and devaluing  farmers lands. So supporting multinationals over people is that the plan
2863 2018-02-17 16:55:51 You do realize... motor oil is no vagina equivalent. 
You need to chug vagoo!
Also take that oil nozzle out of your mouth... you're suckling...
2864 2018-02-17 16:55:51 As soon as somebody says Tar Sands, you know they are a hater, as well as scientifically illiterate. You cannot make oil from tar. Funny use of an unscientific term, considering the source of the statement.
2865 2018-02-17 16:55:31 Mar A Largo is in Florida. Trump was threatened with oil rigs in view of Mar A Largo, and gave Florida the exemption. Scott did nothing,( He claimed responsibility after the fact) he wants drilling he is a Drill Baby Drill, Tea Bagger.
2866 2018-02-17 16:55:19 Yo my uncle ordered my mom some CBD oil lol ... she hype
2867 2018-02-17 16:54:55 And the engineering for a fuel cell is unnecessarily complicated. Fuel cells seem elegant and are indeed better than oil, but when you look at batteries they can’t compete.

2872 2018-02-17 16:54:10 If someone is making their own mayo, it's their choice as to which oil they use. It can be made with most oils. I would personally use olive or EVOO, but up to others what they use. Not sure why you are telling me what I need to do - are you my boss or something?
2873 2018-02-17 16:53:55 The middle east has sold USA oil for yrs.. How do you expect to erase this 20trillion debt..8
2874 2018-02-17 16:53:47 My cars been making a funny noise. 
And I bought it during the Obama years, so I’m super mad he’s breaking my car. 

And never mind that I NEVER thought to give it a tune up or even change the oil. It’s STILL Obama’s fault cuz HRC and Benghazi and stuff.

2882 2018-02-17 16:52:57 Because it's a more accurate term. You cannot get gasoline from tar, it is a waste product from the refinement process. Oil Sands contain tar, as well as oil. Tar Sands do not contain any recoverable oil. And we like to be scientifically accurate as conservatives.

2889 2018-02-17 16:52:06 Yep his stance exaggerates the supposed benefits of BBT as a sort of cure-all and also at the same time claims it can help anyone - snake oil salesmanship and big bucks to the max.

2892 2018-02-17 16:52:00 There is nothing more boring than waiting for an oil change.

2896 2018-02-17 16:51:39 "The area that you will find the most concentrated and most dangerous amounts of Benzene is the Albertan Oil Sands.  These Oil Sands contain a crude oil with a Benzene concentration of more than 1000000 ppb"
2897 2018-02-17 16:51:27 The Guardian should be reporting that US forces are there illegally protecting Kurdish and ex ISIS terrorists and not distracting readers about Russian mercenaries fighting to recover the oil fields for the Syrian people and their legitimate government.

2903 2018-02-17 16:50:29 The Sudanese economy never recovered from the blow dealt to it by the secession of South Sudan, the newborn country had most of the crude oil that made up about 90% of foreign exchange income. Sudanese governments have -for ages- neglected the potential of other resources
2904 2018-02-17 16:50:16 The oil is not for our consumption because we cant refine it. We cant even build a pipeline in this Country. What investor would invest $ in a refinery in the Oil sands. The environmentalist would lose their minds! Apparently Canada has a barrier that protects our air and water.
2905 2018-02-17 16:50:15 During my pregnancy, I started using Justine Tissue oil on some of them on my midsection.  Some  disappeared and those that stayed weren't the thick dark ones.
2906 2018-02-17 16:50:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2907 2018-02-17 16:49:57 If Alberta was so concerned about the he 50 jobs that they are so concerned about then BC would get 20% of world oil value, Alberta would take full cost of any oil clean up, and sense China wont's nothing to do with it, make it free once it crosses the border into BC.

2913 2018-02-17 16:49:34 80% of CO2 emissions are at the point of consumption at which point all fossil fuels are identical. And with modern SAGD producing methods, Oil Sands Oil highly efficient to produce and equally environmentally friendly as any other source of crude, but far more ethical than most.

2928 2018-02-17 16:48:13 I'd be more than willing to sacrifice (I live in Ontario) to give Alberta a big head start in the green economy if they just would just leave the world destroying oil in the ground where it doesn't kill people. So much for the NDP supporting the Canadian left.

2931 2018-02-17 16:47:39 She's a nutcase. I feel bad. I don't think it's her fault. The people around her have her brainwashed. But it's all for money in the end. Jeep people like her and you'll have a steady flow of money. For guns, coal, oil, corrupted churches you name it. Sas
2932 2018-02-17 16:47:34 Doubt we would see the other content they mentioned, evidence of burned petroleum in the sample if #CERN. I was thinking maybe the oil tanker that blew up a few days back off China was carrying more than oil...
2933 2018-02-17 16:47:23 Yang sabar ne baby oil q
2934 2018-02-17 16:47:22 ลองเสนอมาหน่อยค่ะว่าวิธีที่ว่านั่นเป็นแบบไหน อยากรู้ความเห็นเหมือนกัน
2935 2018-02-17 16:47:15 I dropped B on hot Fryer Oil. Busted him open actually, but a dropkick turned out to be his Achilles Heel... I mean I guess...
2936 2018-02-17 16:47:09 @HondaofDublin When one makes an appointment for routine maintenance (oil change, tire rotation) and shows up on time, one should not be told, “it will be 90 minutes”. I can just drive in and wait that long.
2937 2018-02-17 16:47:03 Fyi...I worked in ad agencies through 80s/90s that worked strictly for big oil. My job was to produce corp propaganda. Perhaps that’s where my cynicism was born. Lol
2938 2018-02-17 16:46:29 Wrong. Oil is pumped from the rigs. Oil is shipped when purchased else where in the world.
2939 2018-02-17 16:46:28 she hates losing her share of carbon taxes if less oil is sold, yet she hates oil and wants it gone!  Oh right her goal is to pay for all the green energy at oils expense and in the process eventually killing oil and driving the cost of energy up in the process! Ontario??
2940 2018-02-17 16:46:27 I’d hazard a guess it’d do less than fuck all for my cluster headaches oranyone else’s migraines

Absolute bullshitting, snake oil peedling menaces the lot of them

2943 2018-02-17 16:45:56 Well dude, we’ll see how much money you get when the oil industry is shut down. U will be living off the land!

2949 2018-02-17 16:45:20 Due to US pressure on real powers of Pk. Under sanction's regime, US pressurizes its poor stooge/crony. India never accepted any US pressure. In fact it was having " Banya" deals with Iran. Paying INRs for oil.

2954 2018-02-17 16:44:18 But I do support fracking. Mainly because we are running out of things to disagree on. Ha!

No, I support it in certain areas. As of now, oil is still needed. Alternative energy sources still lag behind. I support exporting natural gas too. We have an overabundance.
2955 2018-02-17 16:44:14 As a Honda master technician I would never recommend going to 1 of those places on a side note its our job to advise you on what maintenance or repairs your car may need at every oil change. Failure to do so could result in us being sued if failure occurs and we did not disclose
2956 2018-02-17 16:44:07 I did knock one down close to him so that I could get black oil on Barny!
2957 2018-02-17 16:44:03 Senator:  As long as oil prices remain relatively high Putin cares less about Sanctions.  Short of nuking Russia, which I assume you don’t support best way to punish Russia is Drill Baby Drill off the coast of New Jersey and other states.  Your Move!  Actions not more talk.  JM
2958 2018-02-17 16:43:50 Dog without 40, oil , there would be no me 
2959 2018-02-17 16:43:44 benzene is not a component unique to oils sands; if you want to apply your argument to oil in general then go ahead, but again, it's not about "oil sands", which is my point. Same with your argument about Climate Change - there is nothing "special" about oil sands in that regard.

ありがとうございます！！
2961 2018-02-17 16:43:38 @narendramodi Sir please do something for pollution free India instead of Congress free India. Pollution in India is getting increased day by day due to bad city buses and rickshaws running on kerosene and duplicate oil. And please don't ads any tax for this.
2962 2018-02-17 16:43:23 Lavender oil I use every night. Alcohol limits REM sleep and that’s the most restful sleep
2963 2018-02-17 16:43:21 Not to bad just going to make up my own beard oil blend
2964 2018-02-17 16:43:19 They going to get shut down on their own you whiners, it costs too much and there is already too much oil in the market. Kenney trying to politicize it's demise. You'll fool the rubes, but no one else. #ableg #cdnpoli

2967 2018-02-17 16:42:46 Dont live in Alberta. Live near Saint John NB refinery. The one that is bringing in FOREIGN oil that Canadians use everyday, and have NO idea how much environmental damage was made or where it came from.
2968 2018-02-17 16:42:40 fat floats, any kind of oil and grease does

2971 2018-02-17 16:42:11 By not subsidising oil, GST meaning average business class will suffer, service class paying more taxes but without any return of development.
2972 2018-02-17 16:42:07 Taking the implicit challenge @AJA_Cortes lobbed at me and throwing out all the food in my apartment before heading to the supermarket to buy ground beef, eggs, oats, and rice. (Already have fucktons of butter & olive oil.) Time to start treating myself like I give a shit.
2973 2018-02-17 16:41:40 The law says the land needs too be reclaimed but does it say WHEN. All the oil and gas wells abandoned and leaking methane can just cleanup themselves latter.

2975 2018-02-17 16:41:35 Once again, I'm in a field comprised of mostly men (first, oil & gas and now geomatics) but I'm pretty stoked  about the symposium I'm headed to in 20 min. Skills pay them bills.
2976 2018-02-17 16:41:34 no they think it’s just a bad oil pressure sensor but safe to drive and just need to get that replaced 
2977 2018-02-17 16:41:29 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
2978 2018-02-17 16:41:14 The Mmmelting moment bath oil!

2983 2018-02-17 16:39:44 @ToyotaGB hi there can you tell me which type of oil to use in Toyota Rav 4 diesel 2010? Many thanks!
2984 2018-02-17 16:39:26 Someone making hash oil again.
2985 2018-02-17 16:39:25 The weak ass "term of endearment clause" set forth by OUR entertainers none the less , will be our "chickens coming home" to be deep fried. #MAGA is reheating the oil.
2986 2018-02-17 16:39:23 Nothing better to do while getting an oil change!
2987 2018-02-17 16:39:18 No. Because they don't want your pipeline. Because of the Husky Oil spill in Maidstone, Sk in 2016  don't want one in Saskatchewan either.
2988 2018-02-17 16:39:05 Trump has given green light to oil and gas in Alaska. Just above B.C. You think B.C. is free from oil spills and pollution when that starts. You'll have no say then. He will produce what we dont. Will our green tech offset his reckless environmental approach??
2989 2018-02-17 16:39:04 I swear on my life that the Drunk Elephant marula face oil is the greatest thing i've ever done for my skin
2990 2018-02-17 16:39:03 We have more than enough heavy oil globally. Markets will resolve imbalances.
2991 2018-02-17 16:38:59 Israel now invading Cypress ocean spaces?  For oil rights

2993 2018-02-17 16:38:24 He has one roughly circular spot on the top of his head that is extremely dry and frizzy compared to the rest of his head. I dont know what's causing it. I bought him a satin pillow to help combat it, and now some argan oil shampoo and conditioner.
2994 2018-02-17 16:38:07 fish oil pills have the exact same effect on me as tide pods
2995 2018-02-17 16:37:38 This recipe is perfect, EXCEPT use 2 tablespoons of melted duck fat instead. Olive oil will burn at that temp & leave a bitter taste.
2996 2018-02-17 16:37:33 I need avocado oil , where to get ??
2997 2018-02-17 16:37:30 Proven:  Carter page met w Russian oil company,  Trump knows a Russian business owner.  In the words of Comey That’s it?  I don’t know the final outcome .. but each day more evid shows ties between Clintons, Russian money, Steele, Bruce Ohr and wife, Rogue FBI agents. We’ll see.

3002 2018-02-17 16:37:11 I never said that, but you are right. There is black empowerment present in the movie. And I am well aware of the producers and creator.. Are you simply stating the obvious or are you trying to spill oil in the water? Some people just don't like good things

3004 2018-02-17 16:37:10 Did you believe their lies? they are trying to fraud whole world. Today, they published a video and says "Turkish Army stole dozens cans of olive oil" But in real they were honey cans and were coming from a Turkish honey producer. Western media must be careful about their lies
3005 2018-02-17 16:37:03 y’all the guy that changed my oil at the car dealership didn’t want me to have to run out in the rain to get my car so he brought my car in the garage even tho he’s so busy  what an angel.

3008 2018-02-17 16:36:28 Be careful with castor oil. It worked perfectly for a lot of people but caused my cousin's hair to fall out. 
3009 2018-02-17 16:36:27 Interesting to see that my research "Critical challenges in ERP implementation: A qualitative case study in the Canadian oil and gas industry" was cited in "ERP: An Investigation into the decision between buying commercial package and developing internally."
3010 2018-02-17 16:36:20 This headline is why MSM has less credibility to most Americans than a snake oil salesman in a painted wagon...
3011 2018-02-17 16:36:15 i imagine the desperation you're feeling right now is extreme. how does it feel, knowing you got completely played by someone willing to sell out his country for money. 45 is a traitor and you bought his snake oil.

3015 2018-02-17 16:35:29 The mint oil I made can actually work as a beard oil. I’ve had 5 men testing it for me the past few weeks and they love it. So I hope some men actually use this as well!
3016 2018-02-17 16:35:26 Paid by stolen  chickens and olive oil. You should be rewarded for your reporting.
3017 2018-02-17 16:35:20 Hey so my mom said the Moroccan oil mask with the orange cap or any mask with ampollas will help and use it 2 times a week and only shampoo your hair once or twice a week.
3018 2018-02-17 16:35:19 A naked canvass is so peng and even more peng when it has an oil painting on it
3019 2018-02-17 16:35:14 The abu Gharib incident back in 2001 where they were torturing Muslims in Iraq, stealing oil, gold, I mean those stuff got leaked and the fact they were hidden man they are definitely more stuff hidden
3020 2018-02-17 16:35:13 Some healthy body oil, yes 
3021 2018-02-17 16:35:07 These Valvoline Instant Oil change places are getting more and more exausting to go to. Their efforts to upsell are insulting. Saying no to any of their “recommendations” causes them to make it sound as if my vehicle will fall apart after leaving.

3029 2018-02-17 16:33:54 Imaginary Suzuki speech to commuters at Port Mann, Lion's Gate, and Second Narrows Bridges: Please stop and get out of your cars. If all oil must stay in the ground, you too must sacrifice. No more long vehicle commutes. You have SkyTrain, now use it. Or ride a bike. Goodbye.
3030 2018-02-17 16:33:31 You are on the right path and with a drop of anointing oil....
3031 2018-02-17 16:33:31 Applesauce instead of oil
3032 2018-02-17 16:33:23 Potentially it might do away with the CO2 and methane which are released as a result of extracting natural gas and shale oil. Also, it could serve as a source (with reforming & dehydrogenation) for producing 'low carbon' lubricants, plastics, etc.

3034 2018-02-17 16:33:11 Please explain how a dirty oil pipeline is "clean growth"
3035 2018-02-17 16:33:09 Are you using anything to help? When I first started growing mine I used beard balm. Now I just use coconut oil a couple times a week to keep it soft. Both help.
3036 2018-02-17 16:32:56 They had some coconut oil on sale at the target
3037 2018-02-17 16:32:49 @OGEXXL yup. Cause the fat/oil content is more in the big ones
3038 2018-02-17 16:32:44 Yes I knew that Obama approved oil drilling in Arctic. Under Obama the US became energy independent at a big cost for environment since most of that energy requires more energy to extract than the one produced. He had nice rhetoric, but his actions weren't.
3039 2018-02-17 16:32:36 The API issue is not new and will never be solved because it takes far more energy to try and lengthen a hydrocarbon chain than is contained in a barrel of oil. Therefore it is impossible to be able to do it cost effectively in a refinery.
3040 2018-02-17 16:32:29 I’d like to see just one of these patronizing oil change guys correctly thread a serger without a diagram.
3041 2018-02-17 16:32:27 In the world of fake we have fake politicians ones that do NOT do their job working for the people instead they take bribe money from wall-street oil companies the NRA insurance companies the WAR machine and more they have no soul!
3042 2018-02-17 16:32:22 Matthew 25:8-9 
It is our responsibility to make sure that the oil of the Holy Ghost is continuous in our life.We have, right now, all that we need to be ready at all times.The Bible clearly states pray without ceasing and to walk in newness of life! Who does the world see in us?

3048 2018-02-17 16:31:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or illegal overstays.

3052 2018-02-17 16:30:37 I like it! One piece of advice I have is don't paint pure white, up from something like celestra gray and then wash with Nuln Oil and basically use white as an edge highlight or use it as a second basecoat after the wash. Still get that nice white but also nice defintion frm wash
3053 2018-02-17 16:30:00 おれえらい！！！！！！！
3054 2018-02-17 16:29:38 I think big oil will send us there first!

3059 2018-02-17 16:29:11 The Canadian oil and gas industry now employs about 180,000 workers, which is only one per cent of Canada’s total jobs, and almost 100,000 fewer jobs than Canada’s environmental and clean technology industries. #ClimateAction #RenewableEnergy
3060 2018-02-17 16:29:10 Volkswagen can kiss my ass $110 for an oil change?

3063 2018-02-17 16:28:37  US & it’s allies are plundering the country like never before. They’ve slaughtered millions not just in Iraq but across the region so wasn’t that the goal all along? Control of oil is imperative to ensure US hegemony & the petro dollar. Chos in the region benefits the US
3064 2018-02-17 16:28:29 Big oil is getting desperate.  Keep fiddling while the ice melts...
3065 2018-02-17 16:28:26 A challenge. Provide a pathway that meets our goals without the income from oil sands and without the voluntary assistance of the Alberta gov't. Show us all how you would get it done because then we can get behind that plan. But the activists never offer a viable alternative 7/

3069 2018-02-17 16:27:16 Oil ≠ Asbestos and they should be treated differently. 

Oil sands could stop production tomorrow and environmental impact would be unnoticeable. 

Asbestos has a direct link to health impacts.
3070 2018-02-17 16:27:05 Bye  ... we have kept Scotland for long enough , let the EU do it . By the way , its not YOUR oil ....

3073 2018-02-17 16:26:46 Also, #askingforafriend, you are leaving castor oil/coconut oil on your hair overnight to promote growth of long & thick hair, your hair wrap eventually unravels when you sleep so oils will also get on your face. Would hair there grow the same? Thicker and longer?

3108 2018-02-17 16:21:13 well. they had no influence on the data, but they donated enough oil that you could probably fill a few olympic pools a year. 

the good news is it probably means olive oil is a healthy fat to use in cooking, with an *extra* 4 tbsp a day may have a statin-like effect.
3109 2018-02-17 16:21:07 The place where I get my oil change just offered me a coffee and fresh popcorn. Someone is trying to smash

3139 2018-02-17 16:16:57 Don't forget he wants those sanctions lifted so they can go through with the Exxon oil deal that Tillerson garnished right before they invaded Crimea. Crimea is supposed to be the port they need how to export the oil.

3142 2018-02-17 16:16:41 Do not believe any government, any leader. They have their own interests. And they devide and rule. The US is in the Middle East to secure the oil. There is no other reason. Why don't they get out of the region? Concerning religion: quran is maybe worse than bible ...(1/2)

3149 2018-02-17 16:15:49 To see the world’s #2 automaker (Toyota) begin to bail on the hydrogen paradigm to switch to battery EVs means it’s just a matter of time. Volkswagen was never onboard. There will be no commodity-based profit-scraping middle man for EVs like oil was for ICEs.

3183 2018-02-17 16:11:31 In the past couple of days I’ve seen promoted adds on Twitter from Alberta telling me to petition the BC government not to block oil pipelines because “we share more than a border”- these adds are so tone deaf and offensive.

The Lord expects us to obey. Our part: call the elders (Biblical name for pastors). His part is to raise up in His time.

3231 2018-02-17 16:07:11 Yes they would but no such model exists. Nfld producers could easily supply eastern Canada with oil but they don't. They ship to the US. Why is that?
Answer.
3232 2018-02-17 16:07:00 Every Conservative in the country is vowing to kill the carbon deal as part of their election platform.  Oil sands will have to expand production to fill that idiotic pipeline hooking our economy deeper into the dying fossil business.

3279 2018-02-17 16:01:56 What will he do? Absolutely nothing. They have videos of golden showers, so he will continue to break the law, and in between that and golfing and nailing porn stars, he will get us nuked. I mean his buddy Rex sold oil to Russia, who then delivered it to N. Korea, Putins bff.

3299 2018-02-17 15:59:34 But Trump's decision to open up coasts for oil, will also keep us free from buying oil from other countries - keeping gas prices down...and since CA. just increased their gas taxes which hurts everyone there...U should be glad he's helping CA...quit complaining about all he does!
3300 2018-02-17 15:59:24 SO RUSSIA REALLY knows nothing about their very own PMCs in Syria

3301 2018-02-17 15:58:46 @richeisen @RichEisenShow Rich, I have to personally thank you. On your show not too long ago you discussed the proper way to reheat pizza in a pan with olive oil & oregano. I tried it last night and it was better than when the pizza was fresh.  Crispy crust & all!  Thank u sir!
3302 2018-02-17 15:58:45 I hit yes by mistake. I think Farage should be on with @Femi_Sorry femi then the country will see Farage for the snake oil salesmen he really is.

3313 2018-02-17 15:56:37 AP govt asked for Oil drill loyalties, asked many things and CG didn't step out of its comfort zone and granted anything AP asked/demanded.
3314 2018-02-17 15:56:36 More mundane than that.  Hundreds of billions in oil revenue were possible if they could get him elected and put in a sec state to lift sanctions preventing the ExxonMobil deal to drill for Russian oil.  Only the building scandal got in the way of it succeeding.  Barely.
3315 2018-02-17 15:56:34 Would also make us self sufficient and we don't have to rely on Arab oil
3316 2018-02-17 15:56:33 It's not just fish... miso soup tastes like used engine oil and I can't stomach it. Tofu seems to have a terrible texture..
3317 2018-02-17 15:56:23 I should add: What happened after tobacco and BP execs testified? In real terms, absolutely nothing. They go in front of congress, get yelled at, and then go back to what they were doing. The oil companies are still raping the planet and you can purchase cigarettes anywhere.
3318 2018-02-17 15:56:23 Don’t use palm oil tend to read ingredients which annoys ppl don’t care. These lovely animals will become extinct due to human indifference and lack of care.
3319 2018-02-17 15:56:15 But Kramerica Inc. could solve the world’s oil crisis.
3320 2018-02-17 15:56:14 Yes because nothing get to the island without oil I used to live in parksville bc just a tourist and weed town no jobs environmental nutts  killed the forest ind also not like it was in 1970s
3321 2018-02-17 15:56:12 Isn’t the perfect pillow really the ultimate snake oil?

3323 2018-02-17 15:56:03 So you want communism. You want to take away peoples' personal choice and assign job roles based on gender. I presume you want equal representation on oil rigs and coal mines right? Or do you just want the good stuff?
3324 2018-02-17 15:56:02 Where can i find truffle oil or زيت الفقع ?
3325 2018-02-17 15:55:40 Fact not disputed. But it’s not the South West that breeds such insurgency.
3326 2018-02-17 15:55:37 A beauty supply store... it will be in plastic wrap. I have the tea tree oil based
3327 2018-02-17 15:55:29 Sorry why is oil rice?
3328 2018-02-17 15:55:17 Yep. Purveyors of leftist thought must be stunned by the ease and extent of their success.
3329 2018-02-17 15:55:16 what if I put olive oil on it?
3330 2018-02-17 15:55:15 Abi, it is impossible to smuggle thousands of tanks of oil over years+all the eu-isis-fighters came through Turkey. Impossible to do this secretly in a nato state. It was a period (instructed by nato), and it‘s now over.

3345 2018-02-17 15:52:53 A limit on oil sands emissions and a national price on carbon. Politics is the art of the possible not trying to ride unicorns.

3350 2018-02-17 15:51:55 BC deserves to pay more carbon taxes it keeps proving those taxes work right second the pipelines are safest and be does use Alberta oil everyday quit acting like you are better than the rest of us any using environment as an excuse
3351 2018-02-18 23:59:56 Olbas oil and a good chilli, that's what you need xD Hope you feel better soon mate
3352 2018-02-18 23:59:38 Just one fact: the first victim of the $45 oil in 2015 was not shale or deep offshore, it was Chinese  oil wells.
3353 2018-02-18 23:59:37 But if you are in the oil, baking, pharmaceutical industry you buy your politicians quietly and let your opinion be heard through your banks account....also  those not in the arts not undersatand how hard we work...the knowledge and drive you have to bring to the table.
3354 2018-02-18 23:59:12 I was talking with my son about The Wizard of Oz. Snake oil salesman come fix it all Wiz.
3355 2018-02-18 23:59:09 So, you used the wrong oil.. CLP instead of Otis? It's a process. You should try making a sourdough baguette.
3356 2018-02-18 23:59:08 CNY/OIl ---->CNY/GC ---->  American GC Oz/CNY GC oz arb.  Done.
3357 2018-02-18 23:59:03 Yeah on my nails it was just a accident because I rub my oil in my hair and it was getting on my nails and they started growing out the blue
3358 2018-02-18 23:58:48 Oh, we'd likely just keep our oil revenues and our food and drink revenues and our science revenues and our tourism revenues. And we'd likely stay in the EU.

How would you guys manage?
3359 2018-02-18 23:58:32 The best way to weaken the US is by putting people against each other. The Russians are interested in their neighbor China advancing and being the first world power b this would benefit Russia, Iran; and little by little Russia is seizing Venezuela's oil and controlling the area.
3360 2018-02-18 23:58:31 Saw this snot nose on FNS this AM. You may be right. All this kid could do was parrot  liberal talking points.
3361 2018-02-18 23:58:29 Hay alguna novedad sobre PPK y su vida de Lobbysta? Data de 1968 Son 50años de sacarle Buenas Tajadas al Estado Peruano  lo de Hunt oil es RECONTRA conocido, Asesor de esta empresa y luego como Ministro impulso proyecto, así de simple cuanto gana? Porque? Corrupción?
3362 2018-02-18 23:58:28 Lol. No. But better than oil painting. At least imho 
3363 2018-02-18 23:58:25 I watched a few moments of the video. I’m too nauseated to continue.
3364 2018-02-18 23:58:16 I also did. I then started seeing he was a snake oil salesman. It infuriates me how his change made our country worse than it was. Truth always comes out. We finally have hope that true justice will prevail.

3367 2018-02-18 23:57:19 i mean if you want to put your trust into a government that staged a domestic terrorist attack to fabricate a narrative convincing enough to justify an invasion of the middle east to strip their land of opium/oil to sustain its own nation's overconsumption i really can't stop you
3368 2018-02-18 23:57:07 Besides dodger, you forgot to add money-laundering, philandering, snake oil salesman that not one North American bank would lend a dime to. The Trumpster is so SAD!

3370 2018-02-18 23:59:56 Olbas oil and a good chilli, that's what you need xD Hope you feel better soon mate
3371 2018-02-18 23:59:38 Just one fact: the first victim of the $45 oil in 2015 was not shale or deep offshore, it was Chinese  oil wells.
3372 2018-02-18 23:59:37 But if you are in the oil, baking, pharmaceutical industry you buy your politicians quietly and let your opinion be heard through your banks account....also  those not in the arts not undersatand how hard we work...the knowledge and drive you have to bring to the table.
3373 2018-02-18 23:59:12 I was talking with my son about The Wizard of Oz. Snake oil salesman come fix it all Wiz.
3374 2018-02-18 23:59:09 So, you used the wrong oil.. CLP instead of Otis? It's a process. You should try making a sourdough baguette.
3375 2018-02-18 23:59:08 CNY/OIl ---->CNY/GC ---->  American GC Oz/CNY GC oz arb.  Done.
3376 2018-02-18 23:59:03 Yeah on my nails it was just a accident because I rub my oil in my hair and it was getting on my nails and they started growing out the blue
3377 2018-02-18 23:58:48 Oh, we'd likely just keep our oil revenues and our food and drink revenues and our science revenues and our tourism revenues. And we'd likely stay in the EU.

How would you guys manage?
3378 2018-02-18 23:58:32 The best way to weaken the US is by putting people against each other. The Russians are interested in their neighbor China advancing and being the first world power b this would benefit Russia, Iran; and little by little Russia is seizing Venezuela's oil and controlling the area.
3379 2018-02-18 23:58:31 Saw this snot nose on FNS this AM. You may be right. All this kid could do was parrot  liberal talking points.
3380 2018-02-18 23:58:29 Hay alguna novedad sobre PPK y su vida de Lobbysta? Data de 1968 Son 50años de sacarle Buenas Tajadas al Estado Peruano  lo de Hunt oil es RECONTRA conocido, Asesor de esta empresa y luego como Ministro impulso proyecto, así de simple cuanto gana? Porque? Corrupción?
3381 2018-02-18 23:58:28 Lol. No. But better than oil painting. At least imho 
3382 2018-02-18 23:58:25 I watched a few moments of the video. I’m too nauseated to continue.
3383 2018-02-18 23:58:16 I also did. I then started seeing he was a snake oil salesman. It infuriates me how his change made our country worse than it was. Truth always comes out. We finally have hope that true justice will prevail.
3384 2018-02-18 23:58:14 Cabbage and Pork stew today

corn starch slurry

mix, simmer and eat
3385 2018-02-18 23:57:26 Jill Stein is a Millionaire! She has stocks in Oil companies' and she's no way of being a Progressive!. Jill Stein really helped the election of Trump! But for the Treasonous picture! being in Russia having dinner with PUTIN!! Wow  "Think About It".
3386 2018-02-18 23:57:19 i mean if you want to put your trust into a government that staged a domestic terrorist attack to fabricate a narrative convincing enough to justify an invasion of the middle east to strip their land of opium/oil to sustain its own nation's overconsumption i really can't stop you
3387 2018-02-18 23:57:07 Besides dodger, you forgot to add money-laundering, philandering, snake oil salesman that not one North American bank would lend a dime to. The Trumpster is so SAD!
3388 2018-02-18 23:56:49 Olive oil is the only redeeming thing about olives continued existence
3389 2018-02-18 23:56:39  it really works, try it. Without the olive oil it tastes like chow
3390 2018-02-18 23:56:37 The oil tanker is still turning, CD...
3391 2018-02-18 23:56:30 *when buying olive oil*
"hmm but is the bottle cute enough"
3392 2018-02-18 23:56:21 จริงงง วิ่งมาแล้วว คนสามคนวิ่งเต็มลาน -_-
3393 2018-02-18 23:56:10 Dan aku punya temen yang ortunya miskin bgt

3394 2018-02-18 23:56:03 Lmao I wish i woulda known that before i bought this coconut oil. Oh well now i know for next time 
3395 2018-02-18 23:56:01 if Obama were president now, he'd be asking the UN to boycott Russian oil and shut them out of the international banking system

but this "president" does nothing but have a delusional, unhinged tantrum on Twitter
3396 2018-02-18 23:55:54 Great example! You switch from a gas boiler to gas CHP, and wind/solar/hydro share of primary energy increases. So what, it means nothing, their share of final energy is unchanged. Again: primary energy serves only to highlight the gross inefficiency of oil, gas, coal & nuclear.
3397 2018-02-18 23:55:49 "Clueless" is a bit understated if you are describing someone stupid enough to go to Moscow Gas and Oil, LLC to talk "green energy" with V. Putin, CEO, because no one can be that stupid.
3398 2018-02-18 23:55:46 Yeah my nyx one is like that I have to put a drop of oil in from time to time
3399 2018-02-18 23:55:39 Sounds like a keeper tbh
3400 2018-02-18 23:55:22 Seriously impressed with the inclusion of Midnight Oil!

The entire list is great, but Midnight Oil were such a powerful voice for change in the 80s.  In Australia, anyway.  Their presence, and their like, is sorely missed.,
3401 2018-02-18 23:55:21 Same with oil painting.  Is that a sport?
3402 2018-02-18 23:55:18 I have found myself wondering what Trump smells like. That isn't as weird as it sounds; I am allergic to scented products so I think about these things. I have decided that he smells like Tic Tacs and desperation. Motor oil too, when he's thinking really hard (golf scores).
3403 2018-02-18 23:55:15 Yeah! It’s a twist up tiny pencil but I love it! The ka brow is really good it just dries up quickly, but I add some bio oil to it and it’s fine again
3404 2018-02-18 23:54:59 What precisely is meant by 'convertible under the CNY oil contract', Luke? I used to design exchange traded (and cleared) crude oil futures contracts for a living and this is not futures contract terminology I am familiar with @chigrl
3405 2018-02-18 23:54:53 I got oil paint all over my louis the child hoodie FUCKING FANTASTIC 
3406 2018-02-18 23:54:37 I’m telling y’all, using bio oil on my eczema on my legs works wonders
3407 2018-02-18 23:54:07 โอ้ยทำไงดี กูเขินพวกเค้าาา
3408 2018-02-18 23:54:00 When you receive free oil & riyals from KSA then its OK for you. But if they ask for a small favor; your tiny sect in Pakistan start acting "human" all of sudden n forget that their KAABA (Iran) never condemn HR violations in Kashmir coz of friendship with India.

#iLovePakArmy
3409 2018-02-18 23:53:53 Artisinal, stunning, rustic, pukka, made in Britain, rugged, made to last and all the above. Not sure how to include the flax oil seasoning though.  #naturally_non_stick maybe 
3410 2018-02-18 23:53:45 No and no. 1 if only planes use oil the demand will DECREASE. 2 you realize this is 2018 & oil is being phased out, right? lol
3411 2018-02-18 23:53:37 جزاك الله خير..... كلمه حق من عاب ابتلى فعلا

3414 2018-02-18 23:52:47 She’d snap you like a twig Olive Oil
3415 2018-02-18 23:52:40 I hold no grudge. Men I work with are big consumers. Glocks, all sorts of guns, big pickup trucks costing upwards of $50,000. Oh and one just got a new Mustang. If women cause big govt. Guess they are responsible for our oil addiction & pollution.
3416 2018-02-18 23:52:31 Sara: alright, we’re having a really original salad. I have this bottle of oil Kraft dressing, spring mix from a box to a bowl and I was thinking I’d put some nuts on it. 
Fallon: It is a modern salad?
Sara: no
Fallon: so it’s post modern?
Sara: NO IT’S JUST SALAD

3417 2018-02-18 23:51:59 I bought that shit by mistake and I gotta add hella extra virgin coconut oil just to make my ash go away because that shit without it is water  
3418 2018-02-18 23:51:40 Superdrug is always cruelty free! They have a good skin care range  and of course coconut oil is the answer to everything
3419 2018-02-18 23:51:15 Oh I have been there, darling.
I wish I could give you a hug and cook you some healthy food...nothing austere, lots of olive oil and garlic!
3420 2018-02-18 23:51:02 Does the money supply explain global CO2 emmisions because credit conditions will effect the amount of oil burned?
3421 2018-02-18 23:51:01 I had the wild growth oil forever and barley use it  I’m a try both tho
3422 2018-02-18 23:50:51 I’ve been waiting a hour just for my oil change and it’s still not done... 
3423 2018-02-18 23:50:46 i been drinkin the wrong oil this whole time
3424 2018-02-18 23:50:45 Have to agree. More oil going down storm sewers every year than losses from pipelines.
3425 2018-02-18 23:50:38 Venezuela ran is a banana republic propped up with oil. 

The general public has no social safety net.
3426 2018-02-18 23:50:28 Did he talk about his genius strategy to stop the Russians by forcing oil prices to $30? What a fool. Does he think we're all fools?
3427 2018-02-18 23:50:22 昨日旦那が「ガス代が高いな」って言うから「夏場より湯舟入るし、シャワーの温度も高くするし、洗い物もお湯使うし・・・」って言ったら「洗い物は俺みたいに水を使え」って言うので「だから油っぽいままで結局私が洗い直すし、コイツ水風呂沈めたろか！」って思いました。

3431 2018-02-18 23:49:22 We legitimately had Dravon talked into picking up some oil and balms haha

3433 2018-02-18 23:49:10 Yeh, I read that in the Kinder Morgan press release manual. We are risking 50,000 coastal jobs with an 87% probability of a catastrophic spill for oil that is no longer needed in China - why would we not refine it at the source of tarsands ?
3434 2018-02-18 23:49:10 I can’t wait until all these oil advocate ‘fossils’ become obsolete. Trudeau, trump and the rest of the smoggies will get left behind

3438 2018-02-18 23:48:49 @CanadianTire why on earth would your team make an appointment for 12 and 4 hours later finally start an oil change on my car. Extremely unimpressed.
3439 2018-02-18 23:48:47 crush a clove of garlic on some fresh lime juice. add salt and a lil bit of olive oil if you have. take it like a shot
3440 2018-02-18 23:48:37 honestly just anything with chicken (can be frozen). on high. put a bit of chicken stock and olive oil in there to make it juicy (you can drain it when it’s done). and leave it for up to 6-7 hours. you can throw veggies and rice in there too. and whatever spices you want. 
3441 2018-02-18 23:48:26 All I know is that Rachel is fighting like hell for Alberta and a sustainable future both environmentally and economically. "Stopping all the Oil right now!" is a ludicrous pipe dream. We need the royalties to pay for our transition over the next 30 or 40 years. It ain't free.
3442 2018-02-18 23:48:18 that will put downward pressure on oil price..get short EUR
3443 2018-02-18 23:48:06 While you were working at your fast food job, I was starting my career, while you partied I studied all of chemistry and physics, while you were doing whatever with you cult I was in the oil patch finding my place. when you graduated I had already finished half my major...
3444 2018-02-18 23:47:43 Thank you! I hadn’t checked on this balance in a while. My next meditations will be focused on my Manipura for sure  What essential oil would you recommend for this one? I hear rosemary and chamomile are common but don’t have any on hand at the moment.
3445 2018-02-18 23:47:40 There is mad amounts of oil leaking from the furnace but the amount of heartache and money this place has caused me in the last 72 hours, I’m almost glad it’s happening.
3446 2018-02-18 23:47:22 James Woolsey interview on CNN stunning. His answer for Russia? Lower oil prices to $30! Just kept repeating it.
3447 2018-02-18 23:47:11 CBD oil kind of tastes like weed. I'm neutral about that.

3450 2018-02-18 23:46:52 Current government debt service-to-revenue ratio (12%) is way lower than historical high of 20 to 30% during the 80s - 90s. 

The ratio only increased recently due to decreasing government revenue because of the sharp drop in energy (crude oil & LNG) prices. pre-2014, it’s < 10%
3451 2018-02-18 23:46:41 almost drowns trying a hot oil treatment for the first time
3452 2018-02-18 23:46:24 My day off I did an oil change, laundry and cleaned, and painted. Never truly get a day off but whatever. Hard work pays off 
3453 2018-02-18 23:46:06 This sounds good!! We always use garlic, olive oil, pepper flakes, s&p but it never tastes right :(
3454 2018-02-18 23:46:03 I'm arguing that the final nail in the coffin -- alleged GM/Shell/Std Oil conspiracy -- is a non-factor in the decline of transit in the US. I.e. it did not contribute. The auto would have ascended anyway. Far larger issues were mismgmt of transit and auto's widespread appeal.

3458 2018-02-18 23:45:23 I continue to hear CNY will be convertible under the CNY oil contract.  If it is, if CNY oil is cheaper than USD oil, it will theoretically create an arb that will put upward pressure on CNY v USD.  This will give China the ability to ctrl int'l trade value of USD thru oil link.
3459 2018-02-18 23:45:13 @KORAORGANICS when's the eye oil releasing?
3460 2018-02-18 23:45:11 Done.  Thanks.

3466 2018-02-18 23:44:27 Most vitamins are water soluble, so boiling broccoli will make the nutrients go into the water instead of the actual vegetable. My suggestion is to put them in a bag with oil, salt & pepper and then steam it. Or eat it in soup bc you usually drink the broth
3467 2018-02-18 23:44:21 I'm pretty sure "puppet master" is used in the context of the multi millions they spend in lobbying an giving money directly to candidates who just COINCIDENTALLY support every vote that is beneficial to them. Yes, Dems do it too. Personally I'm lobbying to give Cam a raise.
3468 2018-02-18 23:44:19 Brazil's state oil company Petrobras on Thursday received some $200 million in recovered funds from the giant "Car Wash" anti-corruption crackdown.

3479 2018-02-18 23:43:17 good easy roast chicken. take that chicken. cayenne, salt, herbes de provence inside and out, crush a few garlic cloves, like 5 or more, throw em up in that. heat oil in oven safe skillet (cast iron prolly) n brown on side 2 1/2 minutes, then the other side 2/12
3480 2018-02-18 23:43:14 Doesn't matter. Dr. "green" is up to her eyeballs in oil stocks. And what happened to all that money she collected for the recounts but didn't spend on recounts. 
She has been making a living unsuccessfully running for president. In other words- just another grifter.
3481 2018-02-18 23:43:05 The oil and real estate bubbles , when they pop , will push the debt up further! I hope the conservatives are up to the challenges in 2019 , of Cdns are in for a rough economic ride thru 2025, IMO.

3495 2018-02-18 23:41:18 I think all Canadians should step up and put a halt and intervene on the coal port expansion in BC.  The sole purpose is to ship US coal.  The resulting CO2 of sending this US thermal coal going to Asia is far worse than any oil product that leaves our ground.  Hear the squeels?

3497 2018-02-18 23:40:58 When I really want yummy broccoli I saute with olive oil in a wok. While it's cooking I put in red pepper flakes, season salt, pepper, garlic powder, garlic salt, lemon pepper. It's amazing. I use that with almost all of my meat too haha.
3498 2018-02-18 23:40:57 Well it’s a Human Right & a necessity in order to live not to mention the Govt is the one that allows it to get polluted in the first place by big corps when they approve fracking, oil exploration, mining etc. & by not protecting our waters against these big corps polluting it

3511 2018-02-18 23:39:25 Following CNN: it seems obvious that McMaster wants to lower oil prices to hurt Russia, rather than implement Russion sanctions as proposed by Congress to aid Trump.
Think about it; if the new Russian sanctions are implemented, I believe they will start to open up their dossier
3512 2018-02-18 23:39:23 oil is better than lotion for penetrating skin and really moisturizing HARD

3521 2018-02-18 23:38:24 It’s my thought that we need diversity of energy. Nuclear, wind, solar, oil, hydro, etc., in it should be based on what’s most advantageous for the situation. There is no one perfect energy source that I’m aware of, unless someone masters cold fusion.

3525 2018-02-18 23:36:54 Wild salmon is a good source,  salmon roe is better.   Krill oil is a great source too because like salmon roe it's high in phospholipids   which means higher bioavailability than the triglycerides found in most fish.

3528 2018-02-18 23:36:34 #BBC_News yet again claims that #cannabis_oil (#CBD) is illegal in #UK.  It is #NOT - it's freely manufactured and sold on the High Strret (e.g. Holland  & Barrett) and online. No #therapeutic_claims may be made for it and #NHS may not prescribe it. I've bought it - and used it.
3529 2018-02-18 23:36:33 He was however basing @10-15% of the economy on it, not so much betting the farm but certainly a few of the prize cows.
Though by using the 'oil is a bonus' line he tricked those more gullible amongst us into believing it formed no part of our future budget.
3530 2018-02-18 23:36:17 This is ridiculous. The Stelmach govt was supposed to invest $8 B into the Sturgeon Refinery, phase one. It ended up being $34 Billion with a B. Many Billions over budget. So, Notley and her team are understandably cautious about phase 2. Enough with the "bought by oil" nonsense.
3531 2018-02-18 23:36:16 I like body shop hand creams and they have travel sized ones. Their tea tree oil face wash cuz it really gets the dirt and grime off. Wipes to at least freshen up a little mid flight. Games and music and my kindle

3535 2018-02-18 23:35:57 If this country ever has responsible leadership again, 
Sinclair Broadcast Group needs to get the Standard Oil treatment.
3536 2018-02-18 23:35:50 @CNN Woolsey, CIA, gave the most pathetic excuse for Trump today.  It doesn’t matter about confronting Russia as much as driving the oil price down.  May be a great offense but if we have little success then we deserve any future outcomes for cowardly start.  Victory plus honor.
3537 2018-02-18 23:35:42 That’s just air pockets from nearby oil refinery drilling.

3542 2018-02-18 23:34:30 If no one is buying American oil but Americans then it must not be that coveted globally. Also clean energy is cuts down on oil demand
3543 2018-02-18 23:34:29 Also back then we had an economy hooked on oil which had to be imported at great cost. The reason we had a "crap telephone exchange" is underinvestment, the same reason we have "crap broadband" today.
3544 2018-02-18 23:33:44 @JohnBrennan It seems to me that Mr Woolsey is desperate in making oil price arguments as most effective tool against Russia.
3545 2018-02-18 23:33:41 First it was "get your dog spayed/neutered" for every little issue, now it's "have you tried CBD oil?"
3546 2018-02-18 23:33:36 I encourage you to look up the Koch Brothers.

Money in politics is the biggest issue. Soros, Koch, NRA, Big Oil, Big Pharma.

All of these are a problem.
3547 2018-02-18 23:33:28 Alaskans own 89,381 shares of PARSLEY ENERGY INC, worth $2,905,776. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.

3550 2018-02-18 23:32:29 James woosley is a freaking dumbass, states that what trump says is immaterial but that what he does matters, but with regards to russia he has done jack shit. That trump should get oil down to $30 a barrel. That is the most asinine solution to trying to hurt Russia. #sostupid

3553 2018-02-18 23:32:02 If you see this whole discussion as one about @bukolasaraki then you are wrong. My issue is with all the 109 senators so dont make it personal. But if you want to, then he is not the best. A hand full of oil cant wash a dirty white garment. The CCB cloud still hangs on him.
3554 2018-02-18 23:31:53 My sentiments exactly!!! Say what?  What does the price of oil have to do with it, lol smh #js

3557 2018-02-18 23:31:31 2.Bros Ure wrong. If US wnts to patronize our crude & we cnt produce nko? Hv u forgotten so soon that there ws militancy attacks on oil facilities that brot our production down to 400k frm abt 2m barrels/day? The effort the govmnt took to stabilize it doesn't concern u abi?
3558 2018-02-18 23:31:14 do you disagree with Sherman Antitrust Act and breaking up of standard oil for example?
3559 2018-02-18 23:31:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but lower wages.
3560 2018-02-18 23:31:07 .@AnaCabrera James Woolsey on .@CNN shilling for Trump, says as long as we drill for oil in the Arctic, offshore it doesn't matter if Russia interfered in U.S. elections smh.

3599 2018-02-18 23:27:14 Does former CIA director James Woolsey have stocks in alternative fuels? He just keeps repeating same simplistic mantra about eddy if cost of oil.  He answers no questions @cnn or he has had a stroke

3624 2018-02-18 23:22:57 But things like wage bargaining can't explain *continued* inflation *alone*, something needs to cause wage bargaining to continue to demand higher and higher wages unbounded. Oil prices also can't be sufficient alone - that can either cause a recession or inflation, depends.

3648 2018-02-18 23:20:36 If you can be prescribed morphine (an opium) in the UK, why can’t people with chronic pain and seizures be prescribed cannabis oil? Guess what government, by legalising something, you can control it’s production.
3649 2018-02-18 23:20:33 @AmberRuddHR Give Alfie the cannabis oil you heartless bastards. You can buy weed in any town in the UK anyway. Who do you think you are helping by stopping a six year old control his epilepsy? #MedicalMarijuana #OilForAlfie

3669 2018-02-18 23:18:12 @AmberRuddHR if your Department had concerns about #cannabisoil why not use the medically approved oil from the Netherlands. That’s already medically approved. May be because there are no back handers in it?

3689 2018-02-18 23:16:01 Note: We are exporting oil to the same country we say competes unfairly with us, and toward which we are to target more tariffs. A wee bit of cognitive dissonance?

3691 2018-02-18 23:15:19 It is over OIL. Saudia Arabia is invading Syria to build a pipeline from Yemen to Europe. Saudi is running out of oil, and see Yemen as their future.

3696 2018-02-18 23:14:46 Some facts, Russia has signed agreements with the Syrian regime which entitles Russia control of Syria's energy stations for 94 years, OIL for 50 years and GAS for 25 years. According to the Financial times, #Iran got agreements which entitles them control of phosphate mines etc.
3697 2018-02-18 23:14:32 Do we have energy independence?  Then why are we importing foreign oil?  Why are we exporting oil, product and nat gas?

3702 2018-02-18 23:13:57 Oh, I understand. 
This has nothing to do with politics or economics, this has to do with the #environment and how we need to stop being dependent on oil altogether. It's far past time we take these funds and find alternative solutions and better #RenewableEnergySources
3703 2018-02-18 23:13:34 I love most vegetables. But I cannot stand collard greens. I did find a recipe I like though. My new favorite way to eat greens is lightly sautéed in olive oil with lemon juice and then scooped gently into the trash. It’s excellent!

3773 2018-02-18 23:03:32 Went to grab tin foil and someone put away an empty roll in the drawer- annoying. Then went to grab olive oil and the bottle on the shelf was empty- absolutely maddening. 
Living with men is the worst.
3774 2018-02-18 23:03:31 I’m starting to feel that “Sunday funk” coming on, so I started up my diffuser with some Balance since that oil blend seems to help. I guess even NASCAR can’t distract my brain.

3776 2018-02-18 23:03:19 The West insisted that the best way for the Sudan to go forward is for the South to split from it. Then we realized that the South had three quarters of Sudan's oil. And now there is a raging civil war in the South Sudan. Perfect conditions for oil companies to loot the oil!
3777 2018-02-18 23:03:18 An oil spill like the Deepwater Horizon disaster would be catastrophic for coastal states. It would cost jobs in critical industries like fishing and tourism, devastate our economy, and destroy fragile ecosystems. LIVES MATTER..U do recall the 260,000 oilspill in ND

3788 2018-02-18 23:02:00 McMaster didnt "stand up" to Putin. Thats fake news. He merely restated what the 37 page doc said. However Trump killed over a dozen Russian mercenaries who were trying to take over Syrian oil fields. Eat that.

3795 2018-02-18 23:00:23 Most palm oil ( in major brands ) uses palm oil from trees planted especially for their oil. It’s a pain having to look up what’s in what but all the big companies use ethically sourced so hope that makes life a bit tastier!

3819 2018-02-18 22:56:13 I even wonder if what I buy in the store is what is says it is. Especially with olive and avocado oil.
3820 2018-02-18 22:55:51 I dont eat meat so having a protein breakfast is a good thing!
All you need is an avocado, lemon juice, olive oil and some seasoning

Just cut the avocado in half, take out the pit and fill the hole where the pit was with the lemon juice&olive oil& seasoning

ITS REALLY GOOD....
3821 2018-02-18 22:55:45 Pocky has palm oil in it?! Dammit Japan.

3838 2018-02-18 22:53:30 That called deflection, when you run out of ways to defend your dirty oil and go after something unrelated, like B.C. wine producers.

3840 2018-02-18 22:53:05 @TwitterSupport please stop the promotion of statements by @EnergyinDepth to my feed.

3841 2018-02-18 22:53:00 My dad just taught me how to change the oil in my car :’) but I definitely can’t do it again without him lol

3912 2018-02-18 22:39:51 Tick Tock John.  You probably money laundered through Joule, has 75,000 shares in Russian oil and Podesta Group failed to  disclose.  You were not  hacked by Russians but DNC refused to let FBI see server

3917 2018-02-18 22:39:06 You are the living definition of the word Moron.  The blood of the 17 dead has not even dried, families are burying their Loved Ones.  Just go on and keep cashing your Checks from the NRA and from all the xtra business you are getting.  You are nothing but a snake oil salesman.
3918 2018-02-18 22:39:03 ok, ok... one more thing...

Did you know that it's very difficult to slide a touchscreen with 'tator chips oil on your fingers?

ok, that wasn't the thing... another thing...
damn! now I forgot...

shit!
3919 2018-02-18 22:39:03 I’ll start a petition for Bcers to get a Bigger share of the pie and world class water way protection on the backs of the oil companies.

D. "What's the problem?"

P. "I have a terrible pain in my stomach"

D. "Sorry to hear that, I can't help you though"

P. "Why?"

D. "I'm a doctor of art and culture, do you wanted look at my find oil canvas paintings?"

P. "Get a real job"

3921 2018-02-18 22:38:59 I worked in the oil patch offshore so I know what you mean. I have to consciously suppress my Boston accent.

3925 2018-02-18 22:38:35 Imagine if Wakanda had oil rather than vibranium
3926 2018-02-18 22:38:30 Glad to see they won today. Go Oil!
3927 2018-02-18 22:38:21 How about the yolk?  Because I'm sick, I like simplicity.  A hard/soft boiled egg, a banana, apple.   The only thing I really cook is an omelette with frozen veggies.  No cheese.   They have me on low carb, high fiber.  A salad with just Olive oil and lemon dressing.
3928 2018-02-18 22:38:04 I would only add that UK’s mentioned trade surplus with #SouthKorea is due to the export of Forties crude oil, which boomed after the EU-Korea FTA was signed in 2011. #Brexit will remove us from this FTA
3929 2018-02-18 22:37:51 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.

3935 2018-02-18 22:36:35 Were you in the states after 9/11? There were people all over MSM, both left- and right-leaning, crying out for justice due to Saudi's terror funding. But the Bush admin was determined to protect their Saudi oil buddies and change the narrative to Iraq.
3936 2018-02-18 22:36:18 Economic conservatives scorn fields they cannot easily monetize. If you want to get rich, you are probably not going to major in philosophy or art history. Conservative geologists would rather find new oil fields for Exxon than teach "rocks for jocks" at a local college.

All the rubes in Angrywhitemanistan bought the snake oil
3938 2018-02-18 22:35:50 Ramen has lots of oil so I don't really like it.
3939 2018-02-18 22:35:49 I didn’t say that.  Don’t put words in my mouth.  What i will say is we need to become the leading energy force in the world & by doing so keep Russia from inflated oil prices, their economic lifeline.  We also should strengthen our alliances w/anti Russian countries
3940 2018-02-18 22:35:37 The Iraq war was a crime. Bush lied to the United Nations Suddam had no weapons of mass distraction and he had nothing to do with Al Qaeda. But we know our friends the Saudi's financed the 9/11 attack but because of their oil we don't do anything about it!
3941 2018-02-18 22:35:33 Just thinking about all the oil build up makes my skin crawl
3942 2018-02-18 22:35:30 McDavid the hattie for the Oil. 4-2 Oilers 1:26 left.
3943 2018-02-18 22:35:30 Nice win Oil. Thanks for the help. Now string a few together and blow your draft position.

3946 2018-02-18 22:34:57 This is a non-issue.. the money was from the sale of Iranian oil to the US that wasn’t paid for because the sanctions were put in place. The “Iranian Deal” included giving them back their money. Were we supposed to keep it? Give them a check? What is it that was wrong about this?
3947 2018-02-18 22:34:55 Remember that Russia is also into the Oil markets, that has to be a sign they don't like America........Oh and they made the AK-47  that must mean they hate Colt 45 beer.
3948 2018-02-18 22:34:48 Yoruba boys go wan dey use yoruba sense. We came down at the same busstop. I tell you say i dey go buy palm oil. Instead of you to come make we go together you leave me dey go house, and i asked you specifically whether you no go need oil? You no answer me.

3950 2018-02-18 22:34:41 Levi you are misunderstanding reclaimed tailings ponds with abandoned oil wells. They are not the same thing
3951 2018-02-18 22:34:37 a nice way for Turks to launder transit frees from stolen oil coming from from Kurdish oil wells.
3952 2018-02-18 22:34:34 To prevent nails from peeling, always ensure you remove your nail polish or gel polish with remover, never peel it off, as this will also peel layers of your nail off.  Use a cuticle oil daily, this will keep nails strong, yet flexible.

3959 2018-02-18 22:32:54 This Jimmy Carter appointed “academic” left-washed Chávez in 2004 while State Department’s Roger Noriega yielded to so-called stabilizing Venezuela and oil markets, as Bush waged war with Iraq/ Afghanistan.

3961 2018-02-18 22:32:38 did you know that mom ducks snuggle their babies into their belly feathers, not just to keep them warm and comfy, but also to coat them with body oil so they can swim better (their bodies don’t start making their own oil right away)

....I felt this was somehow important to share

3966 2018-02-18 22:31:50 This is the thing about Alberta's conservatives - they can't stand the idea that not everybody worships at foot of big oil. I don't agree with Suzuki on everything, but I sure as hell don't agree with #UCP trying to silence a critic either.
3967 2018-02-18 22:31:02 Just did my own oil change
3968 2018-02-18 22:31:00 I figured as much. We get low fuel, low oil, low tire pressure warnings...even a warning if a door is open. Nothing to tell you a taillight is out.

3972 2018-02-18 22:30:33 Had the UK, unlike Norway which invested in its people, not squandered the oil money on corporate give-aways, it could feel freer as well. Norway, a bigger country with fewer people anyway, is bound to feel freer.They feel so free that they accept freedom of movement from the EU.

3976 2018-02-18 22:29:51 Oh shit, didnt realise cbd oil was available from shops, kinda makes the article i read seem a bit stupid now, because im pretty sure cbd oil was what they were saying this kid was being denied, perhaps its because its a child, but again, surely the benefit outweighs the risk

4024 2018-02-18 22:21:16 A little more serious then absurd. Al qaeda killed so many innocent people around the world. I didn't even mention saudi arabia who literally fund many salafis, who then become terrorists in Europe. And the UK does 0, because of oil.
4025 2018-02-18 22:21:07 Ik natural hair girls say take care of your hair and let it breathe but for my hair i dont do that. I just wash and deep condition every 2 weeks and oil my scalp every other day. I wear wigs or protective styles. My hair grows faster when i dont do anything to it

It stands to reason that you’ll be just as concerned with big money given to democrats from the big banks, oil, etc. Keep it in mind when you choose primary candidates!
4030 2018-02-18 22:19:58 Energy independence would mean less reliance on oil, and less power for the Islamic world on the global stage. See Dubai funded movies against fracking, and anti nuclear hysteria brought to you by OPEC.

4039 2018-02-18 22:18:42 I suspect many of them are being encouraged in this by their parents.

4043 2018-02-18 22:18:22 Need switch from talking up war & Defense.. ipalnp-US method for keeping oil profits up...& start committing to things that genuinely threaten us all. Climate change, air pollution, habitat destruction, toxins in enviro, plastic in sea
4044 2018-02-18 22:18:12 Yes. We've collectively lost sight of that even as we celebrate gritty steel heritage in shadow of Pittsburgh's tech ed & med resurgence. Carnegie & Frick loom large, but Lockhart & Rockefeller's Standard Oil partnership less recognized. This house was across from Lockhart's home

4047 2018-02-18 22:17:48 Gas prices are always a two edged sword. In my area of the country, the drop in oil prices resulted in the loss of large numbers of jobs. Most people around here would be happy to see gas prices stabilize at something reasonable if it meant bringing some of those jobs back.
4048 2018-02-18 22:17:39 you can do any of those!  I usually either roast or sautee.  most veg tastes pretty good roasted with olive oil and salt.
4049 2018-02-18 22:17:30 
4050 2018-02-18 22:17:27 When oil dropped from over $100/barrel to as low as $26/barrel, that up to 75% fall - a sustained 50+% drop - sheared away essentially the entire profit margin for many producers. Even if you weren't literally losing money on every barrel pumped, it was deadly.

4054 2018-02-18 22:16:49 Then let’s stop focusing on oil greed and start on meat industry greed!
4055 2018-02-18 22:16:44 ? Has anyone brought up in court...babies born with addiction/ withdrawal and the fact they give them methadone to treat withdrawal symptoms when CBD oil could be prescribed with way less side effects... I would ask sessions if more chemicals is the solution to a baby?

4060 2018-02-18 22:16:33 Give it a rest Axelrod. Unfortunately Trump won.  The alleged "hacking" etc is nothing the USA doesn't do 24/7/365 when direct invasions and coup d'etats etc aren't feasible. Not to mention the overwhelming "influence" of big money, Wall Street, Big Oil, Big Pharma on politics.

4062 2018-02-18 22:16:26 Tried putting warm olive oil on my lashes like what I saw on Instagram.. ends up accidentally pouring ‘em on my eyes..
4063 2018-02-18 22:15:54 also: used the ouai rose oil on my hair after my shower and its so soft! one pump on wet bob-length hair was perfect and doesnt look greasy at all. it absorbed into my hands so fast when i was done as well
4064 2018-02-18 22:15:46 Blend 1 pound chili with 2 cups daikon. Blend with Olive Oil. Drain through cheesecloth Serve to your worst enemy.
4065 2018-02-18 22:15:41 Yeah, use a peeler to create slices, lay them in a tray with a little olive oil...in the over at 150c until they crisp up. Move them around part way through 
4066 2018-02-18 22:15:38 Without regulation of dose, ingredients and content you can not effectively administer a drug or a dose of anything ingested that could alter your mind. Until that happens, you are buying snake oil. That's where I started this talk and that's where I'll finish.

4069 2018-02-18 22:15:33 Depends. I lean more towards olive oil unless I need the flavor that comes from butter.
4070 2018-02-18 22:15:21 I believe their *per-capita* GDP has been recorded as falling over *40%* from mid-2014 to the end of 2015.

I realize that's a lot to take in, and I doubt the Russian government wants to acknowledge it.

But the crash in oil & gas prices was even more profound than it seemed.
4071 2018-02-18 22:15:21 I hope it works for you! I was on it for a month but it didn't touch my pain. I came off it as I was told I am only allowed it for 2 months as its too addictive. CBD oil isn't legal there?

4074 2018-02-18 22:15:00 Not a good analogy. Energy consumption is more complicated than that. Canada imports billions worth of oil every month. Obstructionism costs Canada jobs, revenue and the money multiplier effect for the economy because Canada can produce its own oil. More damage with oil tankers.
4075 2018-02-18 22:15:00 Ya go ahead and create a stupid law that has nothing to do with the problem. Sounds right for you. Can't wait to see the oil rigs in California.

4083 2018-02-18 22:13:54 Yes, Trump is bringing back Capitalism, but only for the Poor and Middle class. The Rich will continue to be blessed with Socialism in the form of "too big to fail", billion dollar "bailouts", government contracts, oil depletion allowances, non-negotiable drug prices, etc.
4084 2018-02-18 22:13:53 The top four R's have got to go.  They are ALL complicit.    Our country/democracy cannot survive with them in charge.  Power MUST be voted out of their nra bloodied/oil stained hands before they completely destroy all that we love about America. Throw in Hatch to that ilk.
4085 2018-02-18 22:13:38 Oil and gas never sleeps!!
4086 2018-02-18 22:13:26 My old-school tailoring lecturer taught us to oil our tailors shears by gently rubbing them (blades open) on our hair!  Apparently doing this every time you use them gives just the right amount of gentle lubrication, with no excess oil to mark the cloth.

4096 2018-02-18 22:11:59 It was awesome! I copied a vegan recipe from a restaurant we go to here. Soaked in soy milk,tossed in cornmeal and regular flour and sprayed with oil. Air fryer for 13 mins and then tossed with wing sauce.

4098 2018-02-18 22:11:18 Amanda, I agree with you! I'm on Tramadol because I need the  painkillers, but my doc told me once I'm 100% free from the military and  it's legal to do so, he'd like to try me on something like CBD oil b/c it would probably help & is safer
4099 2018-02-18 22:10:49 Please what can I use for my very dry skin? I'm already on a Shea butter and coconut oil regimen. Is there anything else I can use? Help please!

4125 2018-02-18 22:04:57 Be careful not to over exfoliate or harshly because it could darken the hyperpigmentation. Be sure to use astringent or after shave after shaving and avoid putting on makeup right after. Use a vitamin c serum and layer on an oil after if needed for your skin type.

4128 2018-02-18 22:04:22 well, I would add a Saudi Arabian quest for their own oil pipeline thru Syria to Europe.
Aand Russia defending their Ally Assad from an Illegal US (CIA/Deep State) Proxy Amry (ISIS, Al-Qaeda/Nusra ) called 'Rebels'.
And Iran trying to jump in to poise for an attack on Israel.

The CBD oil worked better for me

4137 2018-02-18 22:03:15 A few energy takeaways from Munich: Security policymakers seem much more worried about geopol risk than oil mkt does, esp in Mideast.

And, trump loves spending other people's money and being a terrorist so, they're kind of made for each other.

That preparation actually works with a lot of vegetables. Just not the really leafy/tender ones.
4166 2018-02-18 21:58:30 I dislike what you had to say, exploiting  the #Arctic for its #oil is bad; giving N. Korea #internet is a good thing. @VanHipp @FoxNews

4171 2018-02-18 21:58:02 So, Dr. Jill, a Green Party member, thought Putin, a fuel oil marketer, brought everyone together to promote a green economy. It's actually impossible for anyone to be that stupid.

4182 2018-02-18 21:56:04 Where exactly is this "reclaimed" landscape? Unfortunately, even if as wonderful as it sounds, that one place is insignificant when compared to the scale of massive habitat destruction cause by oil & gas across our province. Surely, if you've been there, you know that?

It’s not weed it’s just CBD.

I can also get 400mg CBD oil. All for cheap. If you are looking for CBD I would go this route. 

Otherwise look for some King Louie, that has a high CBD % but nothing even close to 99.99%

4192 2018-02-18 21:55:32 Well Saddam offered business for oil but they kept Iraq under sanctions so no oil sold, just via UN oil for food programme. I think the oil is not the only motive the USA wants to control the middle East and protect Israel. Anyway let us see how the Iran dimension will work out.
4193 2018-02-18 21:55:22 does it tell you when you are due for an oil change? I love my 2013 Outback, but was astonished to find it didn't have that modern feature.
4194 2018-02-18 21:55:11 Did I even mention how you and the USA helped over throw a loved iranian leader, for oil? Eventually leading to the crazy ass regime now? Also how thatcher gave weapons to the muhajideen that later became  Al-Qaeda?
4195 2018-02-18 21:55:10 I put olive oil on my waffle and it tasted like shit
4196 2018-02-18 21:55:10 my bedroom smells like it’s drenched in olbas oil and I’m loving it, feels good to breathe again
4197 2018-02-18 21:54:55 I’m good oil industry is booming so I’m extremely busy but making good money 
4198 2018-02-18 21:54:51 Hahahahaha coconut oil  was so random #EXOL #BestFanArmy #iHeartAwards @weareoneEXO EXO CHANYEOL
4199 2018-02-18 21:54:21 Brian should know they already are! And Trump is taking over some oil customers of Vlad with exports from America which is just freekin awesome
4200 2018-02-18 21:54:20 Whatever you do, use a SCIENCE based product. So called natural solutions are nothing but gibberish. You need to be looking at cortizoids. Again, all the other stuff - coconut oil, Shea butter, teabags, cream-of-sum-young-guy, crocodile tears etc are complete crap.
4201 2018-02-18 21:54:06 King,,, I’m re#SEASONing my cast iron pan and the polymerization of vegetable oil is clearly occurring, but the creosote clearly fuccin up a homies eyes 
4202 2018-02-18 21:53:49 I don't think our politicians really know, they just do as they're told.
 My best guess is to do with the US, Rupert and oil.
4203 2018-02-18 21:53:27 Oh no!!! I didn't get out of bed until THURSDAY!! The flu took me down!! Elderberry syrup and oil of oregano may help too :) I hope you recover quickly. It's no fun 
4204 2018-02-18 21:53:14 Killing my toothache pain but don't like how this makes me feel on a whole. Dulls my awareness to my surroundings and my clarity of thought. It's not a good feeling other than the pain relief. 
Tell me more about this clove oil.
4205 2018-02-18 21:53:04 Gonna burn the midnight oil in the studio tonight. Got a lot on my mind and in my heart.
4206 2018-02-18 21:52:45 The blatant claim by Rachel Maddow + others that Donald Trump wants mentally ill to buy guns is ridiculas and absurd. People believe this
4207 2018-02-18 21:52:45 Yeah. I remember seeing oil based explorations somewhere.
4208 2018-02-18 21:52:42 The only real risk is having kids smoke it ,this is because it hinders cognative development. Another reason is that cbd oil is legal and available in shops and that helps with epilepsy alot apparently
4209 2018-02-18 21:52:41 did they use the burning oil ?
4210 2018-02-18 21:52:40 good I hope you all go broke and your oil runs out even sooner
4211 2018-02-18 21:52:11 I concur wholeheartedly. Opening up new coal, gas and oil is completely unacceptable when the world needs to decarbonise urgently. As South Australia has shown with its visionary #RenewableEnergy projects it is also unnecessary
4212 2018-02-18 21:52:11 Oh heck no!  I had my first one in January and never want to have another. I did use lemon juice mixed with olive oil - an ounce of each - it was gross but I ended up passing it broken up relatively quickly after that! May be worth a try.
4213 2018-02-18 21:51:56 @CRTnotices @EnvAgency both failing to clear up/contain a major oil spill on the river Lea around Tottenham, loads of wildfowl affected, banks soaked in oil, basic containment not put in place. As a boater I’m really, really angry at the lack of action.
4214 2018-02-18 21:51:52 If they just could take the carbon out we would be on to a winner - can do I know but only in limited form and not enough to save us from the destruction wrought on by Big OIL and their unrelenting emissions
4215 2018-02-18 21:51:47 Massive tub of Kirkland organic coconut oil for like 20 bucks.
4216 2018-02-18 21:51:41 I love coconut oil
4217 2018-02-18 21:51:28 went to the alter today and had Pastor pray this over me and anoint me with oil. #confirmation
4218 2018-02-18 21:51:21 This New Year, I love to #win a Family bundle of Wiley’s Finest Wild Alaskan Fish Oil via @etspeaksfrom
4219 2018-02-18 21:51:18 Just like oil don’t mix with water, I know for fact that I’m not for everybody. I’m content with that!
4220 2018-02-18 21:50:50 100% agree brother. I’m just against all the BS they need to start in order to get to the oil. Instead of just saying “listen bruh we gonna need some oil cuz you’ll got all of it, let make some type of bilateral business and go on with out lives” that’s what I think it should be
4221 2018-02-18 21:50:32 Olbas oil might help. Good for helping to open up the sinuses.
4222 2018-02-18 21:50:21 Even politicians repeating these debunked stories. No retraction, just leave this nonsense out there willfully. Serves purpose for them
4223 2018-02-18 21:50:19 Don't the Chinese ppl see everything as yummy yummy tasty treat everything that walks or some snake oil TMC.
4224 2018-02-18 21:50:07 Paycheck came in one day early and I'm about to act a fool. Just got an oil change and hitting up Dave and Busters to drink at the bar alone
4225 2018-02-18 21:49:56 Smoother than Morgan Freeman’s voice slathered in baby oil

4227 2018-02-18 21:49:30 Yeah, man. Same here. Frickin' carbs. I love salads, though. And I am mostly oil, vinegar, lemon juice with parsley, mint in there.
4228 2018-02-18 21:49:00 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
4229 2018-02-18 21:48:54 bread + olive oil + herbs = love
4230 2018-02-18 21:48:46 Dads gf got sriracha infused coconut oil. I tell her to use it as makeup remover.
4231 2018-02-18 21:48:46 Nearly bought @NutellaGlobal today. NO NO!! Palm oil? What are you thinking? Well, clearly not planet conservation  #BoycottNutella @nutelladay #SayNotoPalmOil #palmoil
4232 2018-02-18 21:48:40 Since it's to the USA's benefit Kinder-Morgan not be built makes me wonder how much US money is behind these protests?  Pipelines are by far the safest way to move oil.  Do something for Canada.  BUILD IT.
4233 2018-02-18 21:48:35 ~Ur trying 2 mix common sense & the government. That's like trying 2 combine oil + water. Good luck with that.
4234 2018-02-18 21:48:22 Oh you!  *shares coconut oil with you*
4235 2018-02-18 21:48:22 That is exactly my point, we are still using oil and until we get to the point where we are not, why would we not use our own resources? Would you rather import it?
4236 2018-02-18 21:47:44 I have and it says bio oil which don’t work just gives you spots then says stupid things like out egg yolks on ur face
4237 2018-02-18 21:47:43 Everytown claims, training /w supremists, repeal of Obama SS reg all untrue. Millions still repeat them. Where is honest journalism?

4245 2018-02-18 21:46:16 You & your party make it difficult to make respectful comments.Implying men in the oil patch are sexual predators, people against the carbon tax are misogynistic climate deniers, & Canadians against ISIS are Islamophobic.

4249 2018-02-18 21:45:52 I was able buy fuel today at Forte Oil on Waff road. I spent less than 10minutes there... One thing is certain tomorrow, I'll double my shoulder pad and cruise out of my street.

4251 2018-02-18 21:45:38 How will you know when y’all are busy drilling oil for money ..Christensen won danish player of the year and player of the year at one of the biggest teams in Germany .He played on an European stage when he was 18 ..Call me when larpote makes an appearance for his country 
4252 2018-02-18 21:45:28 Refine it in Alberta. Then it could be shipped anywhere. Greenpeace has nothing to do with how I and my coastal BC neighbours feel about the very real threat of an environmental disaster here just so your dirty oil can be shipped unrefined.
4253 2018-02-18 21:45:23 I didn't mean give literally. I meant that he wouldn't have handed Cliff over Ewing Oil by just selling his shares over. Anything that happened though was all ok because in the new Dallas J.R. got Cliff back from the grave. One of my favorites Dallas scenes is when the police...
4254 2018-02-18 21:44:57 Sorry the day didn't work out your way. Take it easy . Stay out of the oil flow was no way.better days soon
4255 2018-02-18 21:44:48 I know you think Dollar will move up this week, I am a bit skeptical as US produces so much oil now, also given choice of Dollar or the stockmarket Trump chose to sacrifice Dollar but we will see, BOJ level of uneasy with usdjpy started around 108.5-108.25
4256 2018-02-18 21:44:45 It's not that romantic actually lmao

The true parts were the oil fire (my parents before I was born) and the spaghetti flying off the plate and onto the floor (my dad trying to serve his brother spaghetti as a kid)


4257 2018-02-18 21:44:43 *lips part and looks away, trying to control myself, i want to scream because you look too hot, i had forgotten how muscular and manly you look like this, warms my hands with some oil and sits on the bed* now i need you to relax completely
4258 2018-02-18 21:44:19 WE offer a system where petroleum products at subsidized rates plus other benefits can be gotten as well as unlimited flow of financial freedom where you get paid to your personal account as much as N100.000 on WEEKLY bases.All with a one-time registration of N15.000.
4259 2018-02-18 21:44:15 The first streetcars were electric, quiet, non polluting. But the oil companies swooped in and destroyed the electric engine, preventing it from thriving. As a result Wakanda never revealed their technology to the rest of the world.

4271 2018-02-18 21:43:08 I’ll find out in next few days- just drove almost to the border for the correct oil!
4272 2018-02-18 21:43:08 That's our village snake oil salespeople. Doing what she does best - chasing a light on a wall...
4273 2018-02-18 21:43:01 wouldn’t start scratching the surface on the big oil links — might get yourself involved in some stuff you could regret
4274 2018-02-18 21:42:38 Wake up! The world is asleep. Use this quietness and burn the midnight oil!
4275 2018-02-18 21:42:35 We are meant to serve.  Figure out who, when, and where and you’re cooking with peanut oil!
4276 2018-02-18 21:42:29 The situation that has been allowed to grow is being ignored by all the so called great country leaders.
The US has one concern, Venezuela’s oil.
There is hardly any talk from the UN to assist the people being brutalized by Maduro.
4277 2018-02-18 21:41:58 #RPT last cash position mid Sep was $27m adding $1m per month. 5 months have passed with 50% increase in production, significant increase in gas/oil. Taking this on board cash now around $35m. What will they do with this cash? That's why I'm invested and patiently waiting..
4278 2018-02-18 21:41:51 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
4279 2018-02-18 21:41:46 Puerto Rican salad is literally just lettuce, tomato, & olive oil lmao nothing more nothing less
4280 2018-02-18 21:41:39 I'm done with the defense approach.  It's pointless with the left..they have parasitic diseased minds.
4281 2018-02-18 21:41:26 The Duvernay is a *very* small part of their operation as they remain  75%  weighted to thermal oil production at 30kbpd with potential to  expand to  80kbpd if conditions ever become favourable once again.  Just  a [super]  high beta pick based on belief of longterm WCS recovery
4282 2018-02-18 21:41:16 That whole idea was cemented when he did not place the new sanctions against Russia with Tillerson as a back up. I still think it is because of the oil deal Tillerson & Exxon has in place if sanctions ever get lifted rotally
4283 2018-02-18 21:41:10 "@Kenn. Tantra Oil For Wordcraft: Charming Speech..."
4284 2018-02-18 21:40:55 I don't know but I think right now is the BEST TIME to get in on mlming the hell out of CBD oil because that shit is exploding and there is money to be made, my friend.
4285 2018-02-18 21:40:36 I agree..most of us have been called those things over the last few days..one of their favs is saying "shame on you"...
4286 2018-02-18 21:40:31 So the biggest clash was over.. an oil field. Not over gassed people or rebels or refugees. The more things change the more they stay the same.

4289 2018-02-18 21:40:24 Thanks for your comments. You should overly eurusd & oil (a retweet somewhere on my feed has it) strikingly strong correlation.
4290 2018-02-18 21:40:19 @AJWVictoriaBC why do we not hear any, let alone plausible, solutions to become less dependent upon oil/gas and even excessive use of electricity? Why are there no detailed solutions being presented to the public and to the present govt by the GreenParty (at any level)?
4291 2018-02-18 21:40:17 Amla oil makes your hair grow so much  it just has a strong smell

4293 2018-02-18 21:40:07 The people were commanded to bring oil for the Menorah in Exodus 27:20. Worship isn't optional. #Tetsaveh
4294 2018-02-18 21:40:06 Bobby had already left the oil business at this time; especially after Miss Ellie left him with #Southfork. JR felt he would be more empowered as chairman at Westar; however, it was a scheme put together by nemesis Carter McKay & Dusty Farlow (Sue Ellen's ex-flame).
4295 2018-02-18 21:39:58 The world is gradually moving away from oil and its by-products such as plastics. Investors are divesting, nations are setting target years for the end of oil. When the "carbon bubble" sets in, our oil would become "stranded assets".
4296 2018-02-18 21:39:49 I'm on eco styler argon oil. So I'll see how that goes
4297 2018-02-18 21:39:37 Keep dreaming liberals not getting there way this time ! Stick the oil pipeline where the sun don't shine... The people tired of the liberal bs in Canada!!!!!
4298 2018-02-18 21:39:30 True! There's a young girl, 8-9yo my neighbour born with narcolepsy, improved a lot with medicinal oil, her supplier was closed down, the ambulance has been there twice in the last week poor darling, shouldn't be happening .That's why I think of Jenny heaps
4299 2018-02-18 21:39:24 Israel is WORSE than ISIS. ISIS is a direct product of Israel and Americas desire to own every last drop of oil in that entire desert.
4300 2018-02-18 21:39:22 You mean it’s not payback for killing Iraqi’s for their oil?
4301 2018-02-18 21:39:03 it's backed by oil...
4302 2018-02-18 21:39:01 it's been almost a week since I burned my arm with oil and the pain is getting worse instead of better :))))) why why why why

4306 2018-02-18 21:38:50 Eco-terrorists at it again.
Doing the bidding for Soros Buffet etc along with all globalist elitists .
They don't care about oil they want to divvy up Canada for our water and cheap resources.
4307 2018-02-18 21:38:42 US Oil chart looks abit like usdjpy lately, hence I am glancing at oil, I don't trade oil, anyhow, great posts and charts, keep it up!
4308 2018-02-18 21:38:37 Backed by a Billionaire spending oil money to I don’t even know what Thorhir did and well Suning now. We were the Chelsea and Man City of the 90s - 2000s
4309 2018-02-18 21:38:34 Morally wrong is not using all the animal when we are killing them for meat (which is still a popular Choice),then using oil derived synthetics or GM fibres. 1000s of years we have cured hide and skins without modern tannery dangers. ECOSURE Scheme aims to do best practice.

4311 2018-02-18 21:38:27 You stupidass!  The GOAL was to get you elected.  Don't think that we  have forgotten about that $500 billion oil deal that Tillerson was supposed to complete.
4312 2018-02-18 21:38:05 Well I say let’s get out of the dinosaur fuel business and focus on renewables. There is  a glut of natural gas already. We won’t be fighting for Middle East oil anymore. We don’t need it. So that issue  is off the table. Mother Nature has been abused enough.
4313 2018-02-18 21:37:55 People think the #Illuminati are a bunch of pedophiles who possess alien technology and also control banks, oil companies, media and the global supply of Oreos.

That's ridiculous. We're not pedophiles.
4314 2018-02-18 21:37:41 Canadians should be protesting the 10 acre mega mosque compound being constructed in Ft Mac, northern Ab. Seems plan is to have Muslims operate our oil sands after they drive current developers out and devalue our oil then maybe sell off to Sauds? Pipelines will get built then.
4315 2018-02-18 21:37:35 I remember when North Sea oil was due to come on stream  , we were going to be a booming economy , where did it go wrong ? We certainly did not improve our infrastructure
4316 2018-02-18 21:37:32 It’s -3 degrees outside and our heating oil tank is empty. 
This is going to be an amazing night 
4317 2018-02-18 21:37:25 I am a robot. I piss oil
4318 2018-02-18 21:37:25 Personally I only consider a pipeline in the national interest if it's owned top to bottom by Canadians and the oil is going to Canadians and there is no other means to get it there.
4319 2018-02-18 21:37:24 Omg I absolutely love the oil!!!
4320 2018-02-18 21:37:17 The kids are just pawns in the media's game

4326 2018-02-18 21:36:57 I'm not sure. Cliff was a partner in Ewing Oil with him and Bobby and he didn't leave. He wouldn't have just given Ewing Oil to Cliff. I'm pretty sure he had a plan to get it back but it fell through when he wasn't the Chairman at Westar.
4327 2018-02-18 21:36:55 Sean Parnell is a Big Oil Lawyer right look how he gave Big Oil billions of Alaskan Tax Dollars away to them. Walker is just the same, Tax Credits they should never get, make Big Oil pay it's full share as the Seafood Industry pays.
4328 2018-02-18 21:36:53 Great, so we’re going to stop subsidizing big oil, big pharma, and big agra any day now.

Can you meet prime banks ? Because we would like to introduce you investments bank to check by your lawyer.

You are welcome to check personally
4330 2018-02-18 21:36:22 That's a legitimate business. He gravitates to scams, on his own, he would be some MLM mid-level marketer for snake oil of one kind or another.
4331 2018-02-18 21:36:15 The feet are known to quickly absorb topically applied products, massaging lavender oil into the feet will have a calming effect
4332 2018-02-18 21:35:59 peppermint oil is a blessing when i'm sick
4333 2018-02-18 21:35:38 Am I the only one who tells my Doctor when he is giving me a Prostate Check, "Hey Buddy, can you check the oil too?"
4334 2018-02-18 21:35:37 Amen! Hang in there and Put some more oil in the lamp, praying for your ministry. 
4335 2018-02-18 21:35:37 In high school me and my friends got called to the office because we were offending other students with our “gay tendencies” ( in that we would hold hands, give piggy back rides, and be young lgbt activists in a small oil town that is more redneck than they’d like to admit) so...
4336 2018-02-18 21:35:36 I said it too she should just find a good face scrub  apple cider vinegar as toner coconut oil for moisturizing and keep away from makeup
4337 2018-02-18 21:35:23 So tea tree oil is apparently that smell that makes you oddly horny in old people's houses.
4338 2018-02-18 21:35:01 I also would read this book. One conclusion IMHO: #Trump the ultimate huckster/snake oil salesman/carnival barker is actually a very American figure, one out of the 19th century when his granddaddy ran whorehouses.
4339 2018-02-18 21:35:01 Fair enough, but do that with everything. Big Pharma, foreign nations, oil industry, tech industry, health industry, gambling, etc.
4340 2018-02-18 21:34:46 Losers aren't winners
4341 2018-02-18 21:34:42 Hey mother fucker. Check your inventory for me. Oil filter STP900. I had to get a different one and I’m fucking convinced it don’t fit. I fucking hate oil filters.
4342 2018-02-18 21:34:39 crude oil trading at 72$au/bbl today
down from highs of 156$au it reached last time fuel retail prices were at this level @AustralianLabor @RadioNational 
what is is going on ?
why no trickle down?
do we need an RC into fuel retail to find out?
millions$ being looted from economy
4343 2018-02-18 21:34:34 Just saw an ad on Instagram about using castor oil to help hair growth. And all I have to say is. Black people been doing that. So many “trends” I see now we’ve BEEN doing it. Y’all are LATE.
4344 2018-02-18 21:34:30 And with sweet oil

4346 2018-02-18 21:34:07 why do we not hear any, let alone plausible, solutions to become less dependent upon oil/gas and even excessive use of electricity? Why are there no detailed solutions being presented to the public and to the present govt by the GreenParty?
4347 2018-02-18 21:34:07 Does the groundhog actually see his shadow always or has Big Oil gotten its hands on Punxatawney Phil to make people think winter will be longer and increase sales? #woke
4348 2018-02-18 21:34:03 Agreed.  But what about the 24/7/365 corrupting "influence" and "collusion" of Big money and politics?  In both major parties?  That of Wall Street, Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Defence, Big Insurance etc?  Surely this has a greater influence than anything the "evil" Russians do.
4349 2018-02-18 21:33:57 Yes by saying Alberta should keep its oil in the ground despite what it would do to our economy would qualify him as a radical.
4350 2018-02-18 21:33:54 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
4351 2018-02-18 21:33:54 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4357 2018-02-18 21:32:44 It’s been a while I changed my oil
4358 2018-02-18 21:32:37 My 3 fav ways. 1) With boursin garlic cheese. 2) With cured ham (serano/prosciutto). 3) Slice thin, bit of sesame oil and soy sauce, heart it in pan or microwave.

4360 2018-02-18 21:32:01 I feel you. I mix coconut oil with extra-virgin olive oil, applied after spritzing with water. Loc journeys on YouTube hv been really useful coz I had zero idea about locs prior to starting them.
4361 2018-02-18 21:32:01 condolences from a snake oil salesman are worth less than nothing.
4362 2018-02-18 21:32:00 Norway has carefully managed the benefits of its oil reserves.  Unfortunately various UK governments did not manage these resources as well or invest in the future.
4363 2018-02-18 21:31:43 Lemon essential oil helps too
4364 2018-02-18 21:31:36 CBD oil

4374 2018-02-18 21:30:32 China and others have benefited already from economic globalism. Probably Russia has also been lifted. Market for oil ect.

Does the US and others retreating from globalism increase the likely hood of acting on asperations of physical national expansion?
4375 2018-02-18 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
4376 2018-02-18 21:30:12 Oil just going through the motions at Colorado. Need a heart transplant. I’ve seen Junior B players with better passing skills. Got to start earning their $$, brutal energy!
4377 2018-02-18 21:30:01 You voted for for  literal fracking queen, remind me how that makes you some sort of spearhead against Climate Change? You voted for Saudi oil money ffs. You aren't woke. You aren't informed. You aren't helping even yourself.
4378 2018-02-18 21:29:35 a simple pleasure of mine would be moisturizing with tea tree oil after every shower
4379 2018-02-18 21:29:17 This anarchic mass of probably 3B is almond and grape seed oil! Dry hair has never been an issue, luckily, because I have a heavy aversion to coconut.
4380 2018-02-18 21:29:06 確かに真下って兵長みたいだな
4381 2018-02-18 21:29:05 @OffcialPrec my phone is dead so this is my only form of communication have you used the oil and how was it ?
4382 2018-02-18 21:28:58 I’ve just seen a Holland and Barratt advert on mainstream uk tv for CBD oil.....amazing 
4383 2018-02-18 21:28:41 Tryin to find the courage to ask her out  Was like tryin' to get oil from a water spout. What she would've said, I can't
4384 2018-02-18 21:28:28 GEJ was clueless on security/BH, PMB decimated BH,
GEJ blew off our savings/foreign reserves, PMB build up the savings astronomically
GEJ neglected infrastructure, PMB is building infrastructure
GEJ relies on oil only for revenue, PMB uses multiple revenue sources
4385 2018-02-18 21:28:06 I would argue that radical environmentalism is just like religion, lots of half truths and outright lies, that being said we are no doubt heading towards a green economy but in the meantime we have oil, let's use our own.
4386 2018-02-18 21:28:03 Visited a Vom Fass olive oil store today. A “Tuscan” blend from unknown producer for $12.50 per 100ml bottle separate. Come on guys this is a joke right ?
4387 2018-02-18 21:27:43 Thanks - is there a chart that shows the total BOE of liquids reserves, in addition to these recent additions? Would be cool to see total reserves, less production, plus new discoveries
4388 2018-02-18 21:27:41 I dnt know what happened but all my contacts appeared in my sisters iPhone 
She left Lagos yesterday, she just sent me d screenshot
4389 2018-02-18 21:27:40 I went to an olive oil tasting today and it is by far the whitest I have ever been.
4390 2018-02-18 21:27:21 Dab oil
4391 2018-02-18 21:27:14 if a recipe doesn’t include garlic and olive oil I’m already skeptical
4392 2018-02-18 21:26:58 No joke this works with urine too. Obviously coconut oil is a lot more pleasant, but yeah. In a pinch 
4393 2018-02-18 21:26:50 Indeed you are...even against the wishes of the citizens of Kurdistan. Might i remind you that 93% voted for independence. Meanwhile a mear 51% vited Brexit..... But i get it, BP has to get its oil somehow right, i mean, KRG did stop it before.

4397 2018-02-18 21:26:03 I lived in Warrensburg in college. I was changing my oil, and when I slid out from under the car, there were two girls watching me. 
4398 2018-02-18 21:25:42 Not to mention the lack of privacy... I look at a oil rig news web page and all the sudden im bombarded with oil related adds on my feed. I miss the days of the Tandy 1000. Pandoras box i guess....dot dot dot
4399 2018-02-18 21:25:42 Since moving from wood burning & Whale Oil to Fosil fuels global poverty has reduced by 90%
4400 2018-02-18 21:25:37 How much oil does Nigeria give the US again? How much does it cost the US again?
4401 2018-02-18 21:25:29 Support big Texas oil against Canada? No way!

4404 2018-02-18 21:24:54 Just one of those months when all the big expenses come at once - new car battery, oil change, car registration, and wedding party wardrobes. Can any sum of those count towards a 4th wedding anniversary gift next month???? 
4405 2018-02-18 21:24:48 It's also called selling shit that can cause harm to you with a whole freaking industry and a bunch of zealots denying it...snake oil. No proof, no ingredients, no bonding process, no anything. I don't use anything I don't know what's in it. THAT is called being an adult.
4406 2018-02-18 21:24:47 Sawit palm tree are producing palm oil that claimed to be source of deforestation. Nira/aren palm tree only live near coastline that can produce 2 type of sugar. Coconut palm tree, then you already know what kind of tree is this.
4407 2018-02-18 21:24:35 How much oil does the US use from Nigeria Again?

4411 2018-02-18 21:23:34 Yo he tenido 2: New y Jason and the argan oil. El primero fatal porque la ramita de canela se clava en todas partes y es imposible de sacar sin cargarte la pastilla pero el segundo super guay 
4412 2018-02-18 21:23:28 When financial stuff happens, it happens all at once. In the past week or so:
-my primary care bill
-medical bill from his nurse
-plane ticket
-oil change
-tire rotation
That’s on top of my gas, phone bill, credit card payment, and student loan payment. About a months income.
4413 2018-02-18 21:23:20 I finally stopped getting keloids around my nose piercing and guess what, it wasn’t from using tea tree oil. It was from smashing my face into my steering wheel  who would’ve thought 
4414 2018-02-18 21:23:12 One goal it seems is turning out more ppl that hate the other side to win reelection, build power. Large amount of time spent doing this.
4415 2018-02-18 21:23:02 Our world leaders are all fake. Ordinary life means nothing to them. Why will a 19 year old soldier die for a 85 year old man to live? And being supported the international community.  Take your diamond and leave, sto killing us while still taking the gold and oil
4416 2018-02-18 21:22:52 Oil change complete. Done being outside for the day.
4417 2018-02-18 21:22:51 Thankful for my boyfriend willingly changing my oil
4418 2018-02-18 21:22:42 Michelle did sell Cliff her shares; & she gave the other 50% to JR. When JR found out he would be chairman of the board at Westar, he sold his shares to Cliff; rather than be partners with him. The deal at Westar fell through; & JR was shut out of the oil business entirely.
4419 2018-02-18 21:22:38 That's nothing. I live in Maryland. That's a daily thing for me.
4420 2018-02-18 21:22:36 fuck i’m getting my oil changed at walmart because my anxiety not gonna allow me to go to one of these actual car places but like idk fam oh well fuck it

4425 2018-02-18 21:22:05 Had you been involved in Whitehall defence meetings at the time you'd have heard what was said. You'd then realise that "oil" was never once mentioned. Not by anyone. Ever.
4426 2018-02-18 21:21:57 I was talking abt Scotland's Independence referendum in 2014, that was interfered with by UK Government but they blamed Russia.If it had been Russia interfering, they'd have helped Scotland split from UK to reduce its power & size, they didnt, UK Gov had more to lose,Scots oil

4433 2018-02-18 21:21:08 We will win because we are right. Sickening to see you are willing to sacrifice so much for a Texan oil company. What about the tourism industry? I would say fisheries too, but your party has shown they don't matter either #FishFarms. You suck!!
4434 2018-02-18 21:21:01 What will it cost Nigeria out of their excess crude oil money going missing every year to have stable electricity in the country, are we bigger than China or bigger than United States or bigger than India or not better than south Africa or Ghana? @CNN @nytimes @AlJazeera
4435 2018-02-18 21:20:53 Leave it to me to buy oil forget to put my cap on n go to Essex n back three fuckin times
4436 2018-02-18 21:20:02 Oil based substance caused pollution in the middle of Marlborough. Thames Water reacted quickly but I am told it can take 3 weeks if any bird has ingested whilst preening for problem to show.

4438 2018-02-18 21:19:54 Actually, it's the the International Banking Cartel punishing them for selling oil outside of the petrodollar... Has nothing to do with government policy regarding their citizens... Sad but true. The RoThScHiLdS....

4443 2018-02-18 21:18:52 Coconut Oil is essential...my skin feels amazing... — feeling relaxed
4444 2018-02-18 21:18:42 A couple things here: I will caveat all this by saying I have not been following this very closely so take it for what it's worth.
1) Doesn't make sense they didn't have night vision.
2) It does make sense they were securing oil but because they get a cut? Odd arrangement
1/
4445 2018-02-18 21:18:35 Pumping pressurized chemical-laden water into rock to release oil or gas ain't CLEAN.
4446 2018-02-18 21:18:30 Oh, I know. Oil leaks are an endemic problem in old diesels, especially turbocharged ones (higher compression = higher oil pressure). Drops are fine, puddles are concerning... And with quality oil, expensive.
4447 2018-02-18 21:18:18 I’ve been pissed since Nov 2016; no wait-since he announced his candidacy. He’s a narcissistic snake oil salesman. Will be pissed off until he’s locked up for his insanity and crimes.
4448 2018-02-18 21:17:41 oh yes i also have the argan oil and it makes your hair look so healthy omf
4449 2018-02-18 21:17:32 i’m gonna put coconut oil in my hair
4450 2018-02-18 21:17:17 Snake oil salesman and conned totally unbecoming and pretty horrible
4451 2018-02-18 21:17:11 i love the brand so much it really does wonder to your hair!!! the argan oil one is amazing as well can only recommend
4452 2018-02-18 21:16:47 It might be a big expense now but it will save you money in the long run, especially if for some reason the oil doesn't get topped off and too much runs out.
4453 2018-02-18 21:16:47 Not to mention the Japanese just wanted to take out the US fleet because of their oil embargo against the Japanese
4454 2018-02-18 21:16:13 That's always good news.
Oil is all you need 
4455 2018-02-18 21:16:04 Cracking drop of oil @forthdecor  if the specification requires oil based gloss this is the one we use. #oldschool #loveit
4456 2018-02-18 21:16:00 Today's good-cookin' meal was wild-caught tuna steaks done up on the stove. I used low-sodium soy sauce, olive oil, citrus pepper, garlic and Montreal seasoning. I also sautéed green beans and broccoli in EVOO, garlic, red pepper & aztec sea salt.
4457 2018-02-18 21:15:57 The British government and her hypocritical  Media falsehood(bbc) propagated lies against IPOB to secure their loots in the treasury of nigeria which is crude oil coming from #Biafraland.
4458 2018-02-18 21:15:56 because no one is paying them to care. perhaps Alberta should get in that game as well. at least the Greens would get some degree of credibility if they were seen protesting pipelines FROM the US TO Eastern Canada or oil tankers navigating the St. Lawrence.
4459 2018-02-18 21:15:54 Oil is one. Bush junior finishing his dad's work is another.

4463 2018-02-18 21:15:32 Another note. Oil started puking up before the dollar has even rebounded. When the dollar gets more expensive that will put more downward pressure on oil, together with equity market potential collapse im starting to think we could be on the verge of another major oil crash
4464 2018-02-18 21:15:28 Ye true but remember this is the best spurs team we have had in years if it wasn't for leicester s luck and the rent boys bent Russian mafia owner we would've won the league again,and this year oil money is going to win the league, keep the faith we are due a trophy 
4465 2018-02-18 21:15:18 Apparently this "olive oil for babies" looks & tastes just the same with "olive oil for adult" i'm taking daily (thought it would be somehow milder), yet it costs more than twice as much ∗sigh∗

4467 2018-02-18 21:15:01 Yo Scotty! JJ and Dayton like oil and water.  
@scottaltimaman
4468 2018-02-18 21:14:58 Me and the fella at O’reillys made some jokes about our exs while I bought my oil and filter. Made my day tbh
4469 2018-02-18 21:14:56 I know this was from yesterday, but I buy the baby bok and rub them with olive oil, salt & pepper, and chopped garlic, then grill or sautee. Byeeeeeeeee
4470 2018-02-18 21:14:49 Oil, paint , glitter , use your imagination . 
4471 2018-02-18 21:14:46 Fucking sick off to be honest, really am. Nearly finished my book then on Jim marrs. And then dean Henderson big oil, and the banker's in the Persian Gulf.
4472 2018-02-18 21:14:44 Clove oil? I never heard of that. I don't have any clove oil handy. I have a bottle of seriously strong pain pills that I didn't need after surgery but glad I have until I get to a dentist. I honestly don't understand how people get addicted to things. I don't like feeling loopy.
4473 2018-02-18 21:13:58 When you’re out of snake oil, all you’ve got is all the snakes whose names you’ve taken in vain
4474 2018-02-18 21:13:49 It's your 1 stop shop! I bet you can buy fish bait and tackle too. Maybe even get your oil changed and palm read!
4475 2018-02-18 21:13:47 Awesome Tell! My bag also had a ‘Duckhams’ oil tin key ring on it too!...I lost it at Darley Moor years ago!! 
4476 2018-02-18 21:13:46 If conservatives cared about cartels, they would decriminalize all the drugs which are bought and sold from the cartels.

Meanwhile, marijuana is still considered schedule 1 in the USA.

Give me a break
4477 2018-02-18 21:13:42 @JesseJenkins Hello Jesse. what software is best for modelling energy demand for oil and gas in mid and down streams?
4478 2018-02-18 21:13:42 Is it just me, or is this Av's/Oil turning into The Worlds Longest Hockey Game ?
4479 2018-02-18 21:13:28 I wanna be that oil they put on em lol
4480 2018-02-18 21:13:24 Can anyone possibly imagine that our CIA could do anything nefarious with their multi-billion dollar budget to meddle in the internal affairs of others? Besides Vietnam, Iran, Iraq ....  We're the good guys! (who want low oil prices!)

4484 2018-02-18 21:13:04 I think you are right. But could this reduction be also due to increase in base, decrease in oil prices during the tenure and low inflation.
4485 2018-02-18 21:12:59 オリーブ界の頂点はここだよ。
4486 2018-02-18 21:12:56 Everyone is missing the point. Plastic is an oil based polymer. We can turn it back into that for fuel. Problem is price for recyclers is far to low to invest into this technology. Answer is put levy on them plastic give that cash to the recyclers. Bingo they will go and get it
4487 2018-02-18 21:12:56 It’s a hummus/dill/olive oil mix!
4488 2018-02-18 21:12:36 Poor people up here in Maine have been found in states of hypothermia, near death, because they set their thermostats too low in order to save on heating oil.  And yet Congress continues to subsidize Big Oil.  THE MONEY IS GOING THE WRONG WAY!
4489 2018-02-18 21:12:32 My wife absolutely swears by oil pulling. Seems nasty to me, but she says it works
4490 2018-02-18 21:12:27 Put coconut oil on itinstagram:
4491 2018-02-18 21:12:25 Oh not that old chestnut? At the time I was at the Joint Services Command and Staff College which trains senior armed forces officers in England. The oil issue was debunked very fully indeed!
4492 2018-02-18 21:12:18 Oil Change 
4493 2018-02-18 21:12:11 I thought you can buy cannabis oil at Holland and Barrett now???
4494 2018-02-18 21:12:06 Hard to believe that oil has *nothing* to do with Norway's success. But obviously EEA membership hasn't turned it into a desolate wasteland.
4495 2018-02-18 21:12:04 Depends on who you talk to. There are just as many “little people” who work in the oil patch who want the pipeline for their jobs/prosperity. I have no dog in this particular race but this isn’t the one sided “us vs them” issue you make it out to be.
4496 2018-02-18 21:11:57 I noticed that my car's oil drip is fairly bad. It went from drip to small puddle. It needs to be looked it, otherwise I'm going to be wasting a lot of oil topping off.
4497 2018-02-18 21:11:57 I’ve tried lots of stuff too, and everyone’s skin is different. But I started using organic coconut oil to moisturize a couple years ago and I haven’t had a zit since. It has natural antibacterial/antiviral properties. I don’t use it everyday though. Worth a shot maybe? Good luck
4498 2018-02-18 21:11:56 I noticed that my car's oil drip is fairly bad. It went from drip to small puddle. It needs to be looked it, otherwise I'm going to be wasting a lot of oil topping off.

4500 2018-02-18 21:11:41 Their thermal oil break even is based on $44 WTI Q3.  As long WTI stays below $65 they don't have to make any of the contingency payments to Statoil (which expire in 2020, so far they got nearly ZERO;)  #Statoil also took a $550million loss on Leismer asset sale to $ATH.TO
4501 2018-02-18 21:11:32 Oil be saving a nigga
4502 2018-02-18 21:11:27 Enough is enough, time to move on.  We need to work on renewable energy and not increase or continue with the oil.
4503 2018-02-18 21:11:04 C'mon Oil get a goal

March 6th- Oils Beyond the kit!! Facebook event. 8:00p.m.  Let me know if you would like to be added. We will go over oils that are not in the kit that everyone needs to know about.
4505 2018-02-18 21:11:00 Frying plantains when u are tipsy is the best feeling ever, u can hear ur mind telling the hot oil to burn u if it can. Lol
4506 2018-02-18 21:10:52 We've seen how US intelligence agencies can steal the identities off foreign computers and then use them to confuse. I don't trust the same agencies that gave us "Iraq has WMD's" to justify invading Iraq and stealing their oil Sorry, don't buy the "Russians did it" narrative.
4507 2018-02-18 21:10:36 And babe that horrible belly skin afterwards I'm going to make you rub elemis' oil into my belly everyday
4508 2018-02-18 21:10:29 Ain't that obvious? Oil!!
4509 2018-02-18 21:10:16 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
4510 2018-02-18 21:10:12 He is defo a cult and snake oil salesmen sadly we have too many in politics who maybe aren’t cults but certainly snake oil salesmen
4511 2018-02-18 21:09:58 damn i need my oil changed 
4512 2018-02-18 21:09:57 The transmountain pipeline isn't about energy independence it's about selling oil abroad Canada will still import oil this is about selling it to a country other than the US as a backup plan to #NAFTA #RenewableEnergy is about energy independence
4513 2018-02-18 21:09:53 SOME CUTICLE OIL....
4514 2018-02-18 21:09:35 America's answer to school shootings is to arm teachers? Seriously?!?
Maybe look at what other countries have done...maybe tell the NRA to fuck off. 
Seriously, politicians, you'll still get your $ from Big Pharma & Big Oil. For once, do the right thing.
4515 2018-02-18 21:09:28 Yaga began gnawing away at hand, she poured oil on the bony-shanks.
4516 2018-02-18 21:09:18 He will be the leader of the European Union. Europe will be at war and in a shambles and the oil will be burning and the toxicity will be killing. They will be be fighting to take real estate in a safe environment. But there will be lies as to the war.
4517 2018-02-18 21:09:08 Jumped on the coconut oil bandwagon today. Have to say I am pleased!
4518 2018-02-18 21:09:07 [[ *squirts baby oil on those puppies. flexes them in assorted different poses* ohhh yeah. that's years of aggressive button mashing right there.
4519 2018-02-18 21:09:05 Also a question of time when USD bubble burst. You do realize that Russia & China are  moving away from using USD as the petro dollar & are beginning to buy oil in their own currencies, right? What is the value of USD going to be based on when it ceases being the petro dollar?
4520 2018-02-18 21:09:04  I usually cut it down every other week but I think I’m just gone leave it alone. 
Just shampoo and oil it.
4521 2018-02-18 21:09:03 Coconut oil or go to pets smart at the Bandfield pet hospital thing they have  my dogs get pills and the fleas stay off of them it depends on their weight
4522 2018-02-18 21:08:56 Btw now that you're Med I gotta send you the welcome kit

(it's just a vat of olive oil, that's it, that's the kit)
4523 2018-02-18 21:08:44 I saw three pieces of radical and contemporary performance this week and I’m now laying in a bath of lavander and eucalyptus oil. I cannot help but feel mega smug.
4524 2018-02-18 21:08:36 Should be interesting to read details of Nigeria's action. What is the country doing specifically to partner with these institutions?
4525 2018-02-18 21:08:30 As if she cares. Her constituents are well aware of the snake oil sales pitch. We understand our cuts, if any, expire, & that the elitists have screwed us. The Base is who’s lapping the crumbs and free Twinkies up like manna. Enjoy. Bliss.
4526 2018-02-18 21:08:22 Jobs for Americans
Lower energy costs for world
Less danger of blood for oil conflicts
Yeah, I like that
4527 2018-02-18 21:08:13 This is simple truth. Hard to have a meaningful convo with someone whose whole position is "YOU'RE A MONSTER! THAT IS A FACT AND NOT DEBATABLE!!"
It inclines me away from a thoughtful response all the way to just "Fuck You".
4528 2018-02-18 21:08:01 Masturbating with anointing oil is fun until your dick starts speaking in tongues 
4529 2018-02-18 21:07:56 Over $80 for an oil chanage and to replace an air filter. I’m about to start using the two legs God gave me
4530 2018-02-18 21:07:44 Just scanned a peak smart phone article and was reminded about the peak oil phenomenon. The latter can be easily debunked and I suspect the same is true with the former. Accurate “peak” predictions can only be performed when you have all past data a.k.a. hindsight.
4531 2018-02-18 21:07:43 Upset? No I am not. I just don't understand why people are so pressed about his story & are looking for loopholes & negatives. Article = mighty accusation, one should state facts. If you know anything about Oil, you'll know it's hard to say which project will be a huge loss cont.
4532 2018-02-18 21:07:36 When Alberta is trying to put pipelines and oil tankers on our coast. There is the damage.
4533 2018-02-18 21:07:05 Isn’t the Norway model having a tiny population and huge reserves of oil?

we're at a point where a former CEO to big oil is our best choice.

(Rob Porter, btw, worked for hatch for years.)
4535 2018-02-18 21:06:28 They have lots of oil: the revenue is used to give Norwegians peace of mind in retirement. In the same time, their taxes are 50%. Do you want to be happy like that?
4536 2018-02-18 21:06:26 Bible said "anoint my head with oil" not the wig
4537 2018-02-18 21:06:20 I have an unhealthy obsession with tea tree oil, i legit would take a bath in it.
4538 2018-02-18 21:06:02 Kinder Morgan isn't about ensuring Canadian energy security, but rather about providing Asia with dilbit. With or without KM Canada will be importing oil.
4539 2018-02-18 21:06:01 He didn't remind anyone so he wouldn't be lying.When is TRUMP going to tell the truth about owning shares of oil.Trump Russian spy for Putin.Trump should stay in prison for ever.Trump no more American than his dad that begged to stay in the U.S.

4541 2018-02-18 21:05:34 11 pm on a Sunday I find myself googling if almond oil is lethal to cats because, somehow, vlad managed to soak pet of himself in it.  And I still can't find out how he did it.
4542 2018-02-18 21:05:15 Owning slaves isn't the same thing as flying. The analogy is wrong.

Abolitionists wearing cotton : going on vacation :: drilling for oil : owning slaves.
4543 2018-02-18 21:05:05 I’m diffusing an essential oil called “Joy” right now. It lies.
4544 2018-02-18 21:04:19 Washed/conditioned my hair, Jamaican oil, and have some Cantu leave in conditioner in  with a diy oatmeal face scrub on my face y’all can’t tell me ishhhh
4545 2018-02-18 21:04:18 The #TNTDallas didn't take into account the reunion movies. And instead, put JR into a retirement home in a despondent state after having lost Ewing Oil and being shut out of the oil business altogether...and the story takes off from there.

4550 2018-02-18 21:03:30 infinite gratitude to canola oil
4551 2018-02-18 21:03:23 Dear Ed:
Unfortunately, Congress works for Big Oil, Big Guns, Big Pharma, and Big Banks before they even think about the American people
4552 2018-02-18 21:02:59 We can safely retire @JustinTrudeau, @cathmckenna, and @RachelNotley's bogus assertions that they're balancing the environment and the economy. All three are in the thrall and service of the oil industry.
4553 2018-02-18 21:02:57 When Lisa’s out I will often make myself a bone-in rib-eye. High heat cast iron, oil and butter, bit of rosemary. Nice and crusty and medium rare. Mashed potatoes on the side loaded with garlic.

4560 2018-02-18 21:02:03 The Anti-Christ will rise to tell the world that these oil fires and spills are not that bad, keep working we have developed the air scrubbers. IT IS RUSSIA WHO WILL SAY THAT THEY ARE FULL OF SHIT. as they have already begun to do so.
4561 2018-02-18 21:02:00 The NRA, pharmaceutical companies and the oil industry spend the most buying politicians and therefore the US has a problem with gun violence, opium addiction and carbon emissions. I wonder if there's a connection...

4563 2018-02-18 21:01:32 Finally got a tune up and an oil change. My fucking car was shaking like it was shivering.
4564 2018-02-18 21:01:30 Cindy, Canada is cutting off its nose to spite it's face by allowing the US to dictate who can buy oil. They can't war with Canada so, sowing discord amongst Canadians is their next best option. And, look how well it's working. 
It was the same story with salmon farming. Really.
4565 2018-02-18 21:01:28 Yea I been using castor oil for a little but I’ll most definitely try olive oil as well. Thank you!!!
4566 2018-02-18 21:01:28 This snake oil POS even blocked me when his jig was up months ago.  Birds of a feather talking shit.
4567 2018-02-18 21:01:24 Once a dog realizes you pick pick up their poop , using a plastic bag , They will make their dumps an Olympic event .

Like pooping on top of a street curb to make the clean up similar to the Valdez Oil Spill .
4568 2018-02-18 21:01:14 Yes, but you forget that she only sold half of them to Cliff She sold the other 50% to J.R. which he sold to Cliff so he could get control of Westar and he had a plan to eventually get Ewing Oil back In the first reunion movie when J.R. came back to Dallas he got it back from him

4580 2018-02-18 20:58:06 A lot of circumstantial evidence and coincidence. Their father did oil deals with Stalin until he Stalin kicked him out. Their business strategies mirror KGB tactics. Time will tell whether I am correct or not.
4581 2018-02-18 20:58:05 Yes but the don't own an oil well , which if you want the best players that's what you need, sad but true.

4592 2018-02-18 20:56:21 They havent very much at all, though they like to pilfer other countries and claim it under the british bullshit name...see Scotlands North Sea oil for reference.
4593 2018-02-18 20:55:50 The oil is his cum
4594 2018-02-18 20:55:49 It’s so weird. I get tons of propaganda ones too. Like some oil company trying to convince me they’re so green. Just never fun or cool or relevant.
4595 2018-02-18 20:55:49 Coconut oil for literally everything.  Our generations version of paracetamol
4596 2018-02-18 20:55:32 An oil/vinegar sauce? Or like a Dill version of pesto?
4597 2018-02-18 20:55:32 Delicious... let me oil your hot body...
4598 2018-02-18 20:55:09 I agree that too much Cdn oil is foreign owned. Not selling that oil on the open market however, is not beneficial to Cdns. Or, the planet. Canada leads the world in environmental stewardship. We should be working together, united. Not pandering to ecoterrorists like Greenpeace.
4599 2018-02-18 20:54:33 Lights off. Lavender oil diffusing. Goapele playing on the speakers. It’s a vibe

4603 2018-02-18 20:54:09 In the new show or the original? At the end of the original Cliff didn't own Ewing Oil. I don't even know what company they were referring to that Cliff owned in the new show. They said that his company was the one his mother had, but he bankrupted that company.
4604 2018-02-18 20:54:07 Because they use oil wealth belongs to people through a sovereign wealth fund to help 100% & not like in UK & the USA who have handed it over to .01%
4605 2018-02-18 20:54:06 I feel that we live in fleeting moments because we are moving quickly with little accountability. The need for recognition and quick rewards have become important, but that’s not what matters. People matter. Slogans don’t put food on the table, or teach a child to read.

4609 2018-02-18 20:53:27 AOC claims so but still being developed. They also claim top torque to oil prices out of all producers in Canada.  Still weighted to thermal oil production with 30kbpd of Bitumen. Montney is $25CAD boe netback @ $55WTI. Duvernay $45. Lots of growth potential w/ improved oil price

4611 2018-02-18 20:53:05 Hard to invest in fossil fuels when susuki's mandate is to leave the oil in the ground.

thank you for listening
4621 2018-02-18 20:50:33 Which is why the pipeline must be stopped first. 

We've already seen the political pressure cause capitulation to Big Oil by politicians w/o the twinned pipeline. 

When the pipeline is complete stopping economy destroying supertankers will be almost impossible.

4623 2018-02-18 20:50:09 As he got older, #JohnRoss most likely wanted to make it on his own; and not necessarily trade on his #Ewing name. Plus, #JR at that point had been completely shut out of the oil business & had lost what was once #EwingOil; which had been incorporated into #CliffBarnes' company.
4624 2018-02-18 20:49:20 Yeah let me hear more about democracy from Woolsey. The former CIA chief who is on the board of Jeanie Oil with Dick Cheney who gets contracts from Netanyahu to take oil out of the land that Israel stole from Syria.

4627 2018-02-18 20:49:02 Is society more dysfunctional, or have our avenues of communication  exceeded the our language and social development? How often do we feel we can have 'win' a debate with a pithy or witty phrase? What happens our legislators resort to slogans when deciding important issues?

4630 2018-02-18 20:48:44 @BBCOne you got the story line on @callthemidwife4 absolutely wrong tonight. The Nigerian name Ade Babayaro is Yoruba and Ade claimed oil was found in his home. Oil is not mined I. Yoruba land but in Niger Delta and Igbo land. #VeryPoorResearch

Unrelated, but I have followed their success in Winter Olympics most of my life, so these are very good times. Peace!
4634 2018-02-18 20:47:58 But the truth is that only God can save us. Dense forest, mountain ranges, grand canyons.  Nature. The seas will be aflame with oil fires and made toxic by oil spills, both Atlantic and pacific.

4637 2018-02-18 20:47:39 I dont pay taxes so someone else can get a degree. With all the liberal whining about evil big business and big oil. What about big education,  pay for a 4 yr degree with no marketable job skills. How about ending all subsidies and make college's charge a price people can afford.

4642 2018-02-18 20:46:56 Nicely put Colin. I think those teachers realize it’s oil that put food on their plate and not some guy who has more travel miles than most and uses jets to get around the world. Hypocrite
4643 2018-02-18 20:46:56 Messed around and got an oil pen. Work is so much easier now.
4644 2018-02-18 20:46:38 I'm anointed with fresh oil.

4648 2018-02-18 20:46:19 North Sea oil was used as a savings plan in Norway, the U.K. Used North Sea oil to reduce taxation. Norway publish all salaries, UK institutions hide them....

4655 2018-02-18 20:45:06 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
4656 2018-02-18 20:45:06 Confused but I understand it. Always ask snake oil salesmen how it works - usually cannot give a single, straight answer.

4658 2018-02-18 20:44:57 Cooking up another one of those amazing olive breads I made last week. Put in double the amount of olives and olive oil, so let's see how that goes.
4659 2018-02-18 20:44:50 Makes sense. I think Hak and Petr definitely is going to be oil and water, but I think Petr would stellar in net if he can hang and talk with Voracek and Raffl. He'd be better than Neuvirth, maybe not better than Elliott but possibly during a stretch run.
4660 2018-02-18 20:44:47 You're hard work. Not a revolt but US & allies executed destruction of Libya for the want of oil & power. Appears you have to use twitter so users can vet & correct your storylines.
4661 2018-02-18 20:44:38 oil has historically been a lucrative industry to be in, so gotta keep the train going for as long as possible
4662 2018-02-18 20:44:37 i want to start on the oil part of my baepsae painting so bad but idk if im ready yet HHHHHHHH i just want it to be perfect
4663 2018-02-18 20:44:32 Okay so I went to a juice party pregame last night and had some of the best Omega oil I’ve ever had
4664 2018-02-18 20:44:28 Any time I take my car to the shop they wanna do extra stuff. Please just do the oil change I asked for goodness 
4665 2018-02-18 20:44:18 At least he doesn’t look like oil
4666 2018-02-18 20:44:03 GLENCORE
  This company was founded by Mark Rich, an international criminal pardoned by Bill Clinton. Glencore just sold 9 billion dollars worth of Russian oil stocks. The same company that bought uranium one. I'm sure that's just a coincidence
4667 2018-02-18 20:43:45 I didn't say ICE benefits from ZEV credits. Oil subsidies, dairy subsidies. Maybe we should get rid of them all. I'm not opposed to that
4668 2018-02-18 20:43:34 Agreed, but it's not homeopathic. Homeopathy is a drop of a substance diluted in water thousands of times: it is a scam. Cannabis oil works as it actually contains what it is supposed to.

4675 2018-02-18 20:41:59 I read your letter to bc about pipelines. You try to make it sound like we wont have to import oil if we build the PL.  Have you forgotten those PL are to export oil to Asia? Why not refine it in Canada?  @lori_ackerman
4676 2018-02-18 20:41:54 The best thing I ever did was keep a bag of light brown sugar under my bathroom sink. After I wash my face I put a half tablespoon of brown sugar into my hand and add 3 drops of jojoba oil to exfoliate 2-3 tines a week. Really gets the blood flowing and takes away dead skin cells
4677 2018-02-18 20:41:54 With coconut oil and coconut milk, too.
4678 2018-02-18 20:41:53 I hate getting my oil changed because they check other shit besides my oil and try to sell me stuff
4679 2018-02-18 20:41:15 I used jojoba oil on my face for the first time today and like wow my skin already feels so amazing 
4680 2018-02-18 20:41:12 This hypocrite took $50K from school teachers, money that these teachers earned because of the tax base that enables them to draw their salaries as well as build new school. So where would the money come from for capital and operational expenses if oil sands is kept in the ground
4681 2018-02-18 20:41:09 Confrontation somethin' I don't avoid 
I'm just slicker than niggas like olive oil
4682 2018-02-18 20:41:07 Furthermore, building a national climate plan on the continued production and transportation of dirty oil that few really want as evidenced by the price is building a very poor climate plan. Call it what it is, a bribe to Alberta to do the minimum for the environment.
4683 2018-02-18 20:40:40 Your "dear leader" Donald Trump is a Russian scam a hack of vox populi.  As seen on TV type of scam with a #MAGA label you purchased oil snake to cure ignorance.
4684 2018-02-18 20:40:38 It’s time for an oil change.
4685 2018-02-18 20:40:31 Well, your "security forces" let ISIS& intl. terrorists pass through, train, meet, live, get healthcare from the government, prepare for battle, buy weapons and ammunition and oil, transport it across the border to use against Coalition, Kurds, FSA & everyone. You okay w/ that?

4699 2018-02-18 20:39:44 That's great. Shame much of Man City's funds are from oil and they often enjoy travelling to nearby teams (e.g. Bristol) by jet.
4700 2018-02-18 20:39:38 That's why I get annoyed when people hate on J.R. and call him evil. He's not. He never cared about Ewing Oil being the best for himself. He wanted it to be the best for his daddy and his son.

4709 2018-02-18 20:38:38 You should research the economy of Mexico. I was involved in a case study when I was earning my undergraduate degree. The number two source of revenue for the entire country of Mexico, only supassed by oil revenue, is money sent back from the United States They need those dollars

4713 2018-02-18 20:38:00 I’m a true Oil fan for years, but why not bench Lucic for a game. 7 mil a year, does it matter whether on bench or ice if doing nothing. Maybe a young guy on ice would at least be moving.
4714 2018-02-18 20:37:59 you fundamentally misunderstand how things have changed since the US oil boom... you are saying "years of incompetence" but it really is changing dynamics within the oil industry
4715 2018-02-18 20:37:58 Like in Iraq where they guarded the oil wells while the museums were emptied
4716 2018-02-18 20:37:45 As Signet Jewelers Limited (SIG) Market Value Declined, Shareholder Srs Investment Management Trimmed Its Holding; River & Mercantile Asset Management Llp Raised Holding in Marathon Oil (MRO) by $390,0...
4717 2018-02-18 20:37:42 Just got out the shower shaved and put my coconut oil on when I mean ya girl feels AMAZING 
4718 2018-02-18 20:37:40 He praises the mullas in Iran... I guess Brits still want a piece of our land, oil, treasure !!! @FikkiHyaenen
4719 2018-02-18 20:37:25 @AmberRuddHR I know it's difficult thinking for yourself but show a bit of common sense and give the licence for the cannabis oil.
4720 2018-02-18 20:37:24 I realize you’re an oil patch person, but green/renewable energy is not or does not have to be bad economics, even if it personally impacts oil biz. Business insider and many economic publications see it that way...Anyhow andon that note, I wish you well, genuinely.
4721 2018-02-18 20:37:03 I suppose you would call it a simple pizza.. it's usually made with tomatoes, mozzarella, fresh basil, salt and olive oil. it's very light for a pizza
4722 2018-02-18 20:36:28 Oooh, that sounds wonderful, Kay. They were so good, I use an old recipe my aunt gave us for ducks--we love it and so simple. Just celery salt, onion powder, inside and out and then melted butter on them or olive oil. I sprinkle a bit of garlic powder too. You should try it. 
4723 2018-02-18 20:36:20 i love my parents so much y’all, not only did they surprise me today but they took me to the store and loaded me up w groceries, and then went and got my oil changed and my car washed 
4724 2018-02-18 20:36:17 Yes, just coconut oil that you can find at the grocery store. Swish a tbsp in your mouth in the morning when you first wake up for 10-20 mins, then spit it out. Lots of how-to and benefits info online
4725 2018-02-18 20:36:14 Getting my oil changed and I hand the guy my keys and he says, “oooo it’s about time to get them nails redone!”  first of all, fuck you and yo mama!!! Mind ya business!
4726 2018-02-18 20:35:58 The same generation that’s eating laundry detergent.... what could possibly go wrong?
4727 2018-02-18 20:35:42 Probably should try and get over it because it was Irans money not yours. Just like the oil in Iraq is not your and the minerals in Afghanistan are not yours. Hope this helps.
4728 2018-02-18 20:35:40 once I get my hands on this Pai Rosehip bioregenerate oil it’s over for you hoes
4729 2018-02-18 20:35:40 I did research and since the oil is used for aromatherapy it’s okay
4730 2018-02-18 20:35:29 AB is going through a rough time right now mainly because of the slump in our oil industry.Some have lost jobs,homes and are really struggling.
By bringing in susuki at a time like this shows such poor judgment and highlights their ignorance of what some people are going through
4731 2018-02-18 20:35:28 Canadian oil owned by foreign oil companies with the profit going mostly to them, not to Canadians. It may be in Alberta's interest . It is most certainly NOT in BC's interest in any way, shape or form!
4732 2018-02-18 20:35:21 And oil & gas, auto manufacturers, heavy machine manufacturers, Bombardier. Sounding like an old time conservative & capitalist asking this, but should companies that can't get private financing be financed by taxpayers?
4733 2018-02-18 20:35:20 As a minimum we need an immediate ban on the use of High Fructose Corn Syrup and Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil in human food!

Will @TheBMA get on-board and support?
4734 2018-02-18 20:34:56 If I made a  cologne it would be a mix of gun oil, lumber yard, juniper, cinnamon and fresh baguette
4735 2018-02-18 20:34:55 My worst nightmare: a vegan eating, CrossFit exercising, essential oil selling, extrovert.
4736 2018-02-18 20:34:47 Heard about Lac Megantic, or MMIWG? Or oil spills in Alberta and BC? Islamophobia and crimes against Muslims in Quebec? Or Barbaric Cultural Practices hotline of the Harper era? 
The difference is most Canadians have learned to live life to the fullest despite all these.
4737 2018-02-18 20:34:46 But no USA government department get the oil or are allowed to take the oil, all what happened international oil companies signed contracts with the Iraqi government some of these are USA based companies. In other words the war was to serve the interests of the oil industry.
4738 2018-02-18 20:34:39 Had Mrs T. kept more of our North Sea oil revenues in reserve, rather than squandering them  away to her friends then we might be more able to consider the Norway model. But before we go too far down that route you do have to consider that the Norwegian economy is considerably

4740 2018-02-18 20:33:28 Steam watermelon strips for ~15-20 minutes till they're soft, leave marinating in the fridge with a bit of soy sauce and a few drops of lemon juice (to kill sweetness) and sesame oil (or fish sauce if you aren't fully vegan). After an hour or two its good to go.
4741 2018-02-18 20:33:21 @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @FoxNews Awesome NEWS: a new inland oil refinery is being built in Ft Stockton Tx. 1st new refinery in #Texas in 40 years. 

Thank you $MMEX, @POTUS @GregAbbott_TX
4742 2018-02-18 20:33:14 Or you could just use Jamaican castor oil
4743 2018-02-18 20:33:12 The horns are oil derricks. The toxic smoke and fumes will reach the eastern seaboard of the United States and maybe half of Russia.
4744 2018-02-18 20:32:57 Also oil revenues. But improbable to suggest its trade deal with its largest market is irrelevant.  Anyway Hoey's tweet isn't making your point.
4745 2018-02-18 20:32:43 Yes to timing belts, water pumps and oil pickup blockages. Once drove an A6 1.8T which basically had the same engine block and had all of this to contend with!
4746 2018-02-18 20:32:37 The wise store up choice food and olive oil, but fools gulp theirs down. - Proverbs 21:20 #BiblicalPersonalFinance #PersonalFinance #Bible
4747 2018-02-18 20:32:29 Yes! Like mix the olive oil and dish soap together in a bowl then put your beauty blenders in and put it in the microwave for 1 min but be careful it’ll be hot after

4750 2018-02-18 20:32:06 Trump vents frustration over Russia probe, rails against FBI? I'LL JUST BET THAT HE IS VENTING FRUSTRATION OVER THE RUSSIA PROBE! I THINK THAT I HEAR THE COOKING OIL BUBBLING BECAUSE, HE IS BUSTED! HE IS GOING TO BE JUSTIFIABLY FRIED BY BOB MUELLER,THE FBI & THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!
4751 2018-02-18 20:32:05 And I worry about the possibility of an oil rig disaster on the east coast of Canada.

4757 2018-02-18 20:30:55 Where can I get an oil change in San Marcos?
4758 2018-02-18 20:30:51 Is it just me or have the oil given up?
4759 2018-02-18 20:30:40 I see. So they are selling oil with the thc removed. Shame. I guess it will become available when Monsanto makes a copy.
4760 2018-02-18 20:30:29 Hmmmmmm I thought @lisamurkowski said drilling in ANWR would bring jobs to Alaskans yet.... this is the lowest rate of Alaskans working in the oil industry
4761 2018-02-18 20:30:26 Im expecting an oil pearler wym lmao jk
4762 2018-02-18 20:30:23 Will PEP be able to look them in the eyes next season & say 'R U up for it again like the great SIR ALEX did year in year out, or will he  have to spend a LOT more of ABU DHABI oil money
4763 2018-02-18 20:30:12 How much do you depend on your #car When was the last time you changed the oil?
4764 2018-02-18 20:30:03 To select a healthy cooking oil, look for expeller- pressed or cold-pressed oils to ensure you are buying high-quality, undamaged oil. Oi...

4772 2018-02-18 20:28:20 With goal of decentralizing application in contract arrangement this will be adopted in any sectors across the globe most especially the Oil Sector... I believe I can use Elementh coin to trade crude oil and other petroleum businesses.

4776 2018-02-18 20:27:41 So, tell us @realDonaldTrump. Are you still going to get the 15% of Rosneft Oil if you implement the #RussianSanctions? More? Less?

4779 2018-02-18 20:27:17 #Turkey was an obstacle from the beginning. starting with allowing #ISIS members into Syria, arming them, purchasing oil from them illegally, taking injured ISIS members to Turkish hospitals, not allowing the U.S use their Incirlik air base, and not fighting ISIS at all.

Next.....
4781 2018-02-18 20:26:52 Yes.  Shell oil is one responsible party being sued.  Do we know anyone affiliated with and funds a Vermont "environmental" organization that recently took a job with Shell? Same company supporting paramilitary assassin squads in Niger.
4782 2018-02-18 20:26:49 Don't worry once you bleach the palm oil na ofada stew be that. If you now add iru..... You'll be in second heaven..good luck

It's basically Acme® 'Snake oil'.
4796 2018-02-18 20:24:23 Oil just just pull the goalie at the start of games tbh. 2nd time in less than 24 hours, 12th time this year the Oil let up 1st goal on 1SOG
4797 2018-02-18 20:24:21 #DragonsDen @DeborahMeaden has this sussed.     Total snake oil bullshit.     "Doctor" of traditional Chinese medicine my arse.
4798 2018-02-18 20:24:20 What have we got from all that money and blood we've put into the 'war on terror'? All it does is create more instability which is what the contractors want, for oil deals. Support your 'moderate rebels' all you want, it's a fact that you armed and trained isis and alnusra front.
4799 2018-02-18 20:24:19 What do you think of these oil burners ?

4805 2018-02-18 20:23:12 How come my timeline keeps getting filled with people complaining that veterans get underfunded because we give our money to refugees but no complaints that we give all our tax money away in oil sands subsidies?
4806 2018-02-18 20:23:11 El petróleo  hace años no es  nuestro. Es propiedad de las multinacionales como la Chevron Oil Company. ¿Es usted el único que no lo sabe?
Antes de escribir, consulte!
4807 2018-02-18 20:23:10 The oil will all be set ablaze as the great dragon will rise from the earth. The beast of the Sea is the oil market as it is delivered by sea and the dragon of the earth are the oil fields.
4808 2018-02-18 20:22:58 As an environmental policy student at Ohio State, I understand the importance of reliable science. I also understand the importance of recognizing bias in unreliable studies, such as those funded by oil companies or TERF lobbying groups.

4816 2018-02-18 20:21:59 No... The Russians are still selling North Korea oil & coal & transferring to North Korean oil tankers/cargo ship's in the South China Sea.  We need that stopped and will use sanctions as leverage. Trump has China already cutting most oil & coal delivery's but Russia is key!
4817 2018-02-18 20:21:52 Actually not oil the frame. It’s the earlier oil tank version. Embarrassed 
4818 2018-02-18 20:21:47 Special interest groups such as oil companies?

4833 2018-02-18 20:19:58 Kalau scar, Alpha Arbutin. Niacinamide more to control oil, minimize pores and brightening. So kalau oil and water balance dalam kulit, kulit kurang buat hal. Sebab tu Fel suka kalau ada Niacinamide dlm ingredients.
4834 2018-02-18 20:19:53 changing my oil made my car run a lil smoother lol
4835 2018-02-18 20:19:45 Gosh, you'd have to find a pro for that. But my approach uses a little dry bushing at the start, followed by controlled dark washes adding heavy shadows wherever I can get them. Then sponging on damage, and oil paint thinned with spirits for rust.
4836 2018-02-18 20:19:35 Put some olive oil on it. Extra virgin if you have it.

4845 2018-02-18 20:18:23 @ScottPruittOK is a fraud. What is more natural and clean than wind or sun? Coal and oil is where their money is invested and thats all that matters in this admin. If the world is on board using renewables who we gonna sell flippin coal to?
4846 2018-02-18 20:18:18 I tried Zinsser too mate but as soon as the paints in there it softens up and peels away. I used to always use oil gloss, I will clean a couple out and try u/c and gloss and see how it goes. So annoying especially on the final coat and it happens 
4847 2018-02-18 20:18:17 I support the pipeline as it is the safest way to transport oil. However I will not support any pipeline that has not got all the t’s crossed and i’s dotted regarding environmental protection. That is the most important thing.

4850 2018-02-18 20:18:11 can you please air a story (or several) about the amount of corruption in our government? Paid politicians by the NRA at state and federal level, to narrow it down... then big oil, then war machine, then perhaps a story on how our media is neglecting to provide noteworthy news
4851 2018-02-18 20:18:03 sooooo many people are going to benefit from holland and barrett selling CBD oil !!!
4852 2018-02-18 20:18:01 Got a new hair oil and it smells like everything good in the world
4853 2018-02-18 20:17:59 most people I've talked to attribute it to the latest oil downturn. Obviously there have been big increases in some communities since then, but I don't know if anyone's tested that theory overall.
4854 2018-02-18 20:17:41 I love them so much!  Grilled with some oil salt and pepper are the best!
4855 2018-02-18 20:17:37 Damn I just passed like 20 bikes on the highway, I gotta get my oil changed ASAP

4861 2018-02-18 20:16:44 The preface to "Lord of the Flies" being acted out by teens too brainwashed to have ever read -- or worse, heard of -- it.
4862 2018-02-18 20:16:17 How about Canada annex Alberta for the purpose of containing the oil prodution pollution to within their borders and set up processing plants there and they can supply the rest of us with finished product fuels. Alberta makes money, the rest if us don't pay for it.
4863 2018-02-18 20:15:58 Dude try dish soap and olive oil, it sounds crazy but it really works. You have to mix them together then put it in the microwave for about 1 min. I tried it the other night and was so amazed lmao
4864 2018-02-18 20:15:57 I think they put shitty engines in that car. Or they don’t put oil in it. One of those.
4865 2018-02-18 20:15:50 A65 Lightning with oil in the frame - great bike and vibrated like hell.

4868 2018-02-18 20:15:38 That's fantastic. I use a home made salve with calendula and gotu kola and a bunch of other stuff. Is your oil on the market yet?
4869 2018-02-18 20:15:22 We pour loads of olive oil and salt in them before BBQing. Then we eat them alongside barbecued meat, roasted pepper+aubergines, and potato omelette.
4870 2018-02-18 20:15:20 The cause is common ground we can all get behind and goes straight to root of problem without having the partisan square off brewing now.

4875 2018-02-18 20:14:20 Populism is great -- if all you want is scapegoats/scapegoated groups and overly simplistic solutions to complex problems. In other words, it's snake oil, whether it's Donald Trump proclaiming it or anyone else.
4876 2018-02-18 20:14:06 Caution is out. Oil on track. #NASCAR #Daytona500
4877 2018-02-18 20:14:04 Lol at how when the TV just shouted buy CBD Oil now on a Holland and Barrett advert 80% of the population dont know thats the second active ingredient in Weed 
4878 2018-02-18 20:14:01 I sunk an oil tanker

4883 2018-02-18 20:12:56 I wonder how many of the people that think like this live on American territory acquired in a certain 19th century war with Mexico that was about conquest and nothing else.... a war that makes a war motivated by oil seem downright altruistic by comparison.
4884 2018-02-18 20:12:45 So i was making some udon noodles and I couldn't figure out why I kept getting nauseous. Then I got a sniff of sesame oil and almost threw up. Now i can't eat all this food I made 
4885 2018-02-18 20:12:43 Damn really? That’s trash. Houston area’s beach (Galveston) looks like motor oil.
4886 2018-02-18 20:12:39 I already have the oil, I might just as well offer it to you.
4887 2018-02-18 20:12:32 I saw the bottom of the pic and thought the bottle was oil cleanser  That polish is gorgeous though!!
4888 2018-02-18 20:12:25 Lololol
4889 2018-02-18 20:12:18 Tell ya! Don't mess with Oil money.
4890 2018-02-18 20:12:08 Soooooo, losing is now winning? Good God.
4891 2018-02-18 20:11:54 apparently I forgot to turn off the stove for an hour and since I put too much oil onto the pan it turned into strains The result is a burnt pan+burnt spatula

this is why I should never do cooking again
4892 2018-02-18 20:11:51 Lol aish  dont burn the oil then
4893 2018-02-18 20:11:46 or baby oil on my arse
4894 2018-02-18 20:11:46 Problem is delivery.  Not WCS but still steeply discounted light oil differentials, on the Edmonton LS, if memory serves.
4895 2018-02-18 20:11:40 Aww you're a sweetheart. I reckon I need to give in to tougher cream. Soaking in your neroli oil right now. Xx
4896 2018-02-18 20:11:24 You lost me, but we can discuss Russia's oil reserves their inability to finance production of that oil without Exon Mobile, and our opposition to their invasion of foreign countries when it's relevant.

4906 2018-02-18 20:10:43 oil useless? lol. And we humans are the only creatures here on earth? or maybe the earth needs the oil for itself for some reason? Hmm wonder why we have so many earthquakes lately...
4907 2018-02-18 20:10:35 Who was the one who wanted the @lushcosmetics bath oil/thingie?

4909 2018-02-18 20:10:22 It's still crazy that people won't trust major industries that lobby in Congress (pharma, oil, tobacco, meat/dairy, etc.) But those same people will defend the NRA's beliefs.

4912 2018-02-18 20:09:59 How did they turn out? I use olive oil and it's fine. Secret is using 2 eggs and do not open the oven!
4913 2018-02-18 20:09:58 He doesn’t care. He would have illegally kept it. Just as he said the US should have seized Iraq’s oil fields.
4914 2018-02-18 20:09:23 My bae told me with all her nudes n videos in my phone she can make a catalog or sex tape lmaooo I enjoy nudes... il tell her in a minute oil up n send me some ... n a few videos of u naked shakin that ass I love it she so sexy lmao
4915 2018-02-18 20:09:22 Oil well, they'll learn, sooner or later
4916 2018-02-18 20:09:18 Systematically, oil marketers and the govt have increased fuel price....citizens been made to pay whatever is bn dictated by these sycophants....we can’t continue like this
4917 2018-02-18 20:09:08 ""If you prevent us, we prevent you; if you open fire at us, we will open fire. .. In the battle for oil and gas, the only power you have, you the Lebanese people, is the resistance, because the Lebanese army is not allowed to own missiles,” Nasrallah said."
USGov mediator? right
4918 2018-02-18 20:08:59 Spray it on my scalp and wet my hair a bit and massage the castor oil on both . You know how hair dressers scratch / massage your scalp when they wash it? Thats what i do with the castor oil
4919 2018-02-18 20:08:59 Where my baby oil at? I'm going right this time
4920 2018-02-18 20:08:51 That's so good you've found away to help you and others, I held my first open garden last summer to raise funds for a friends charity in Uganda gardening is a great healer .. tea tree oil is best defence against mosquitosx

4923 2018-02-18 20:08:27 Lol Since when was this a thing?! I’m saudi and I’ve never been anywhere that offers a massive olive oil tasting opportunity like that lol. I gotta get in on that!
4924 2018-02-18 20:08:08 At the time I wondered what was holding his R opponents & MSM back from the scandals. I just thought the media liked the snake oil salesman's rants & increased ratings that came with them. Now I wonder was MSM also being played by Russian fake accts. & were R's some how complicit
4925 2018-02-18 20:07:37 استاذي العزيز انور, في سنة 2015 كما هو موضح في الرسمة, انتاج oil sand  تقريبا مايوصل 3 مليون, بالرغم من ان كندا وفنزويلا ونيجيريا معظم انتاجهم من oil sand.  هل تتفق او تسلم مع هذا ؟؟!! 

شكرا لك
4926 2018-02-18 20:07:36 I warn you though it takes a while for your hair to get used to aloe i could have sworn it was making my scalp dryer but if you wait it out it works wonders for your scalp and the softness of your hair.
And yeah i have a spray bottle with water and a bit of almond oil

4929 2018-02-18 20:07:24 I’m trying castor oil on my lashes and brows. I have no idea if it’ll ever work, but I got a huge bottle for like $11 on amazon. Stay tuned for that. Haha!

4934 2018-02-18 20:06:17 I thought that, as you can buy CBD oil on Amazon. But I'm wondering if they're talking about a purer form of cannabis
4935 2018-02-18 20:06:09 Filling a super soaker with vegetable oil, itll take 10 minutes...
4936 2018-02-18 20:06:04 Not at all... just high thc/cbd extract.. RSO (Rick simpson oil) you tube "run from the cure" a good place to start.. beyond that there are lots of videos on different methods to make the meds.. if making it isnt an option you can purches at most dispensaries.. best of luck
4937 2018-02-18 20:05:55 Without the oil in the supposed non stick pan 
4938 2018-02-18 20:05:30 If Montoya starts 7 games for the oilers the oil have to give up a 4th vs 5th round pick.  Don’t expect Montoya to play his 7 games.  That might be more of the reason than anything.
4939 2018-02-18 20:05:20 So common in oil and gas firms.
4940 2018-02-18 20:04:38 OTOH, despite my best efforts there was still a bit too much oil on the pan being seasoned & it started feeling sticky in spots. However, Lodge says to just keep heating/cooling until it polymerized. So. We’ll see.
4941 2018-02-18 20:04:38 Brown will leave a legacy of failure! ALWAYS Gas & Oil Profits over the health of children & families. Communities living in the shadow of toxic gas storage facilities, oil wells on our coast & drilling in neighborhoods. Legacy of Death  Disease is how he will be remembered

4943 2018-02-18 20:04:19 Just another land grab! Now that ISIS couldn't do the the job for the west they've carve out a spot in N. Syria where large oil fields are and stationed 4K troops. #Invader
4944 2018-02-18 20:04:10 Think wine tasting, but with 70 types of olive oil
4945 2018-02-18 20:03:56 CBD oil for chronic pain: any recommendations/experiences?
4946 2018-02-18 20:03:51 I'm holding Athabasca Oil Corp $ATH.TO w/ fingers-crossed. Prefer small/mid caps for upside. They also have a growing amount of light oil in the Montney & Duvernay and inherited Statoil's assets for next to nothing when they ran out of Canada. $CVE is also on my watchlist.
4947 2018-02-18 20:03:06 Ima acc try the aloe Vera makes sense tbh. With the day before u wash ur hair, do u put the water and oil on ur scalp directly?
4948 2018-02-18 20:02:41 Oil pulling feels so gross but hope it works
4949 2018-02-18 20:02:37 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."

4953 2018-02-18 20:01:45 I'm more interested in what causes people to do such things, focus on identifying/ preventing. This is common ground we can all get behind

4959 2018-02-18 20:01:21 Can someone please inform me of where I can get engine oil at this time 
4960 2018-02-18 20:00:36 Absolutely. The media's culpability in turning this into a straight Ultra vs Ultra punch and judy show (as they love to do) is embarrassing and depressing. But squeaky wheels like Farage and Adonis get the oil. And the soundbites.
4961 2018-02-18 20:00:35 You will love it, whole body scrub...depending on how sensitive your skin is let the oil soak for some minutes to make the mixture more mild,
4962 2018-02-18 20:00:18 A facial oil
4963 2018-02-18 20:00:17 Keep the oil away from BC waters/coast. No business' that is so dirty, is worth BCs environment. #NoPipeline

4967 2018-02-18 20:00:05 GEJ was there for 6yrs and only implemented one agenda looting. Making his wife millionaire in naira and forex then plunging our foreign reserve to all time low from almost 60bn at a time when oil trade d highest with nothing to show. Buhari is making it up again come n chop
4968 2018-02-18 20:00:04 Heart Health Tip: Cook with olive, coconut, sunflower, safflower, corn and/or soybean oil, but do so in moderation.
4969 2018-02-18 19:59:47 There is another one in the same village but they fry their stuff in groundnut oil which gives it an odd taste.
4970 2018-02-18 19:59:43 It is so sad and pathetic that the lives of @IvankaTrump, @DonaldJTrumpJr, and Sloth (@EricTrump) are all based on snake oil. All their fortunes will be auctioned off like Imelda Marcos' shoe collection. Nice little legacy you leave there @realdonaldtrump.
4971 2018-02-18 19:59:35 In Panama the cause was a canal. In Guatemala the cause as oil. In Peru the cause was water. In Venezuela the cause is oil. In Cuba its US business interests. In Sudan was oil but it was the Canadians who caused that. Etc etc.
4972 2018-02-18 19:59:29 Did this guy go on a killing spree because of the NRA? That seems to be the narrative now.
4973 2018-02-18 19:59:23 Not as mean as he has been to the air we breathe, water we drink, soil in we which plant, & oceans/rivers/lakes we swim, fish, & travel across. Relaxing or reversing controls on emission standards, fracking, oil drilling in protected wild refuges, etc., is v damaging & shd stop.
4974 2018-02-18 19:59:13 Hypocrisy and lies. This has always been a federal issue. Bc trying to obstruct our oil while shipping BC Coal to China.
4975 2018-02-18 19:59:12 @alexandraairene P.S. Start fish oil supplements now if you're not on them already!
4976 2018-02-18 19:59:01 Other countries: we practice sustainability and eat what is available w/o harming our environment

4977 2018-02-18 19:58:55 Actually this ‘big tax cut’ you speak of has more than been eclipsed by the rising cost of everything else - from heating oil to gasoline- anyone else notice the steady climb? But go ahead with your rant- divert and deflect -
4978 2018-02-18 19:58:14 oil painting is a myth
4979 2018-02-18 19:58:10 I’m not sure I’d agree with society as a whole being more dysfunctional everyday. A lot of our perceptions are influenced by what we take in, but you are right that we have to look at behavior, as well as, developing resources to prevent these horrendous acts.
4980 2018-02-18 19:58:09 I just poured a big bowl palm oil stew on my white  bed sheet. Please No body should talk to me about pain of child birth.

4987 2018-02-18 19:56:58 its really easy you marinate your fresh tuna in sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic ginger and green onions for 15 minutes or so. Cook noodles and sear poke in wok for about 3 minutes leaving it raw in center. It's delicious :)
4988 2018-02-18 19:56:50 Thank you Britton
I always boycott Companies that harm us and support Trump, Big Oil Koch Bros, Now adding Cos thst support NRA to my list.
4989 2018-02-18 19:56:30 Olive oil tasting?!?! I’ve never heard of this!
4990 2018-02-18 19:56:10 So I'm at brunch at my family friends and i will never understand what it is with middle eastern people and their DAMN OLIVE OIL !
4991 2018-02-18 19:56:08 Good to know. Not that I have either lol I rarely bake and if I do it's usually a mix that just involves adding butter, eggs, and oil or water or milk.

4994 2018-02-18 19:55:29 (Also, boil water and something minty like an essential oil and hold your face over it)
4995 2018-02-18 19:55:14 the 3C head of hair in my household has lead me to understand that any and all solutions begin with "buy a tub of coconut oil"
4996 2018-02-18 19:55:01 If Alberta wants jobs they have to refine at home & explore new industry’s Suncor is introducing self driving trucks that will cut 400 jobs. Other technologies will be coming. 14 big oil projects have left Canada for the USA with more to come. Alberta is screwing itself
4997 2018-02-18 19:54:31 You're trying to talk logic and sense to a froth-mouthed nat. You may as well try to make an oil/water mocktail.
4998 2018-02-18 19:53:57 He does look leggy. But he also keeps scoring. Might well bag a few a game if he didn't corner like an oil tanker.
4999 2018-02-18 19:53:51 got my car new oil, new engine air filter, and fuel system cleaning.  Hopefully one of the above will solve the gas mileage issue lately.
5000 2018-02-18 19:53:31 The cannibal oil used for medicinal purposes  should  definitely be allowed!
5001 2018-02-18 19:53:22 Yes it was Oil and Power. Essentially the attack on Iraq was to neutralize the potential threat from Saddam Hussain to Saudi Arabia. Both Iraq and Saudi are muslim nations.
5002 2018-02-18 19:53:04 I really do be wonderin... how the fuck do I take my car in to get its oil changed
5003 2018-02-18 19:52:29 It is in Canada's interest to get Canadian oil to the open market. It is in the USA's interest to remain your only customer.
5004 2018-02-18 19:52:20 Lol. This guy is something else. Beard oil salesman. Do all oil salesmen have beards? 
5005 2018-02-18 19:52:15 Your snake oil salesman Trump changed the rules for gun ownership for mentally ill
5006 2018-02-18 19:52:14 That Texas oil seem to get the job done I’m just saying
5007 2018-02-18 19:52:11 The dossier is bogus from start to finish. And Trump’s expansion of American oil and natural gas production is doing more to harm Russia than any words he could say.
5008 2018-02-18 19:52:10 Just because your previous tweet was just as childish.

Increasing oil sands production and therefore increasing our GHGs is a bad idea. Have you heard about the costs of climate change adaptation. It's like increasing the number of smokers to pay for cancer treatments
5009 2018-02-18 19:51:53 Norway has oil. Switzerland is a tax haven.

Next?
5010 2018-02-18 19:51:50 Oil change Shawty!
5011 2018-02-18 19:51:48 Tell me you’ve at least looked at Rick Simpson oil...I know you’ve probably “looked” at a million things, and don’t mean to intrude.
5012 2018-02-18 19:51:39 Kalynn and I made some pancit but I added bean sprouts and I made green beans with chili oil and garlic
5013 2018-02-18 19:51:21 Oh there was def mad coconut oil in there and I loved every second of it lol
5014 2018-02-18 19:51:03 This chili oil is cleaning out my sinuses holy shit
5015 2018-02-18 19:50:51 Pipeline west already exists. Expanding the existing pipeline (which has operated safely since the 50s) will bring oil to the open market. Which is good for Canadians. Bad for the USA. Our only customer, currently.
5016 2018-02-18 19:50:26 This isn’t even their CBD oil!
5017 2018-02-18 19:50:14 Albert was very nervous at the time my father used to remember these things because he was then when my father left Germany after the 40 days in the war and my father used to remember how nervous he was so relax take some lavender oil and put it on the inside of your palm .

5022 2018-02-18 19:49:41 It's time to connect the dots between pyschotropic/ mood enhancing drugs suicide and gun violence. Stop letting these assholes demonize the tool when 1/2 the fucking population is on xanax, zoloft, ridalin etc

5025 2018-02-18 19:49:17 The pipeline shippers (oil refineries) pay the increased toll, which will be passed through to consumers buying the refined products. If you oppose the pipeline, don't buy gasoline.
5026 2018-02-18 19:49:06 Thread them the next time xx avoid anything oil based xx

5034 2018-02-18 19:47:45 @CliveBull @LBC - Holland & Barrett are selling Cannabis Oil 'as a food supplement'.

5040 2018-02-18 19:46:53 Nobody likes American freedom. There is no freedom. You're born as a slave to economy and or a footsoldier for oil. Let's point some more guns at eachother to brighten up the day. Not number 1. USA is an island.
5041 2018-02-18 19:46:51 I guess it's better for those products to be made with oil from the middle East... Where gays are thrown from rooftops, women have no rights AND THERE ARE NO ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. 
Your ignorance is astounding.
5042 2018-02-18 19:46:48 You can get degradable wipes that disintegrate. Also people tipping cooking oil down the sink. Maybe need a refuse collection solution for both
5043 2018-02-18 19:46:02 Loved your programme as my Granddaughter, Maisie (15),  has Achondroolasia. Did you know that you can legally buy Cannabis Oil now from Holland and Barratt? xx

5045 2018-02-18 19:45:52 @McDonalds if you would be so kind as to train your employees to bag hashbrowns correctly, that would be much appreciated. My car seat has a huge puddle of oil. #thanks
5046 2018-02-18 19:45:42 I just came for an oil change & they're telling me I have a bad battery and I need to replace my air filter 
5047 2018-02-18 19:45:31 do you oil each time you finish?
5048 2018-02-18 19:45:19 Hey Bart, not every mutual fund in the United States includes big Pharma, big tobacco, and big oil. Plus, there are tons of other ways to invest your money. But good try, bot. Bye-bye

5050 2018-02-18 19:44:53 I rub lavender oil on my face at night - sends me straight to sleep and the oil is good for my skin #winwin
5051 2018-02-18 19:44:53 mix shampoo with either baking soda or a tiny bit tea tree oil. that’s helped me a ton. it just shows up so much on dark hair

5053 2018-02-18 19:44:42 In indictments there is nothing charged having to do with actual "interference." All acts charged are ancillary, interfering even criminal?
5054 2018-02-18 19:44:42 Norway is much richer because the have used their oil revenues to far better effect than the UK.  Please do not mislead this is tantamount to lying, but from Hoey I am not surprised.

5057 2018-02-18 19:43:26 I abandoned the Greens when they abandoned civil rights, and started becoming anti-science. It’s a party of snake oil salesman, and agitators. They can take purist attitudes because they only work in the realm of theory. No action, just talk. Wasn’t always that way.
5058 2018-02-18 19:43:11 about to play a prank on Saika involving oil. wonder how it'll go.
5059 2018-02-18 19:42:49 hey JAG  you promised to back BC anti-pipeline movement. But now you disappeared ? Your voice was silenced by "love & courage" Oil
5060 2018-02-18 19:42:34 Uh... On an oil rig? Great business plan, Callie.
5061 2018-02-18 19:42:31 Opening up Canadian oil to other customers besides the USA is exactly what the USA doesn't want. They like being Canada's ONLY customer. You sir, are very misguided.
5062 2018-02-18 19:42:29 Totally awful palm oil has a lot to answer for

5064 2018-02-18 19:42:22 As I wrote it appears to me to be an oil market play with gold backed clearing/settlement, not a gold/currency play. We shall see soon enough
5065 2018-02-18 19:42:17 My cousin (the one who believes in chemtrails and that cannabis oil cures everything) has just shared on FB that the CIA is orchestrating school shootings so people give up their 2nd amendment right. How am I related to that.

No plane made the TWC fall. 3 buildings brought down by a demolition team completely visible on video. This False Flag was to get support to start a war in Iraq for oil and to steal military budget money

5087 2018-02-18 19:39:15 Don’t feed too much red meat. You can buy dog toothpaste- clean teeth twice a week. Have a clean dry flannel - rub over teeth & then wash flannel & reuse. Try dog treats with mint. Make sure dog is not constipated - add olive oil to dry dog biscuits. Hope this helps.
5088 2018-02-18 19:39:03 One word - Oil
5089 2018-02-18 19:38:44 Canada has one customer for its oil and we like it that way! No pipeline! Keep selling it all to us, under market value! America loves owning Canada's oil! 
CM, I sincerely encourage you to read more on the economics and politics of oil. We can't start real wars with you... Think

5092 2018-02-18 19:38:22 Did you kidnap my cat? Mine has the same exact markings, his name is Oiler since it looked like he played in oil when he was born.
5093 2018-02-18 19:38:10 Oh he is adding “pretend lawyer” to his snake oil gimmick. What insight do you think this clown brings, exactly?
5094 2018-02-18 19:38:03 And I do not suggest this. I also think teachers should write curriculum. Just not special interest groups. Not oil sands or computer companies. And not ATA.

5098 2018-02-18 19:37:37 My wife just smashed a bottle of oil in our kitchen. I've never seen so many pieces of glass. That's one way to kick off the evening #drunktwitter #ItWasFull

5107 2018-02-18 19:37:09 If oil is so critical to Alberta's economy why is the Province broke and in debt? Where is the Heritage Fund? Why is the industry foreign owned? Jobs are not enough to justify the destruction of the environment.

5116 2018-02-18 19:36:04 And in fact now exports oil to markets of premier strategic interest to Russian producers...

5124 2018-02-18 19:35:05 There’s absolutely no reason to resist if you’ve got everyone blackmailed, compromised between a rock and a hard place, dangling by their short hairs over a boiling barrel of oil. Why would they resist?
5125 2018-02-18 19:34:57 How could anyone who is really green ever have considered her? She made millions off corporate health insurance, and invested and big Pharma, big oil, and big tobacco. She was never agreed to begin with.

5134 2018-02-18 19:34:37 Yup. Petro could firstly be a promise (not a proof) issued by PDVSA & returnable in payment for oil supply. Secondly, some kind of mutual assurance framework/association to guarantee acceptance #P&IClub #GuaranteeSociety
5135 2018-02-18 19:34:33 The one Mack I have burns about 2 gallons of oil a day, that’s 200 miles on average
5136 2018-02-18 19:34:12 Public policy on mental health and causation probably be common ground for reforms. Instead, it's a face off btwn gun owners anti gun lobby
5137 2018-02-18 19:33:56 Because America is full of largely uneducated morons, who don't realise that in an alleged Civilized society you live in the Pen (or is it penis) is mightier than the Sword. Though the fact Senate is controlled by the Oil, Weapons, Pharmaceuticals. Explains why Guns arnt Banned
5138 2018-02-18 19:33:52 Your a “cowboy” in name only.  You are a “patriot” in name only.  You are a dyed in the wool liar and snake oil salesman who has taken a keen liking to Kremlin talking points. Traitors will not prosper.  The gig is up.

5140 2018-02-18 19:33:49 Conventional treatment for eczema is steroid creams. Black seed oil has a rich emollient texture that forms a non-greasy film to protect the skin and provide nourishing factors for the skin.

5141 2018-02-18 19:33:42 That's part of the point, yes. I had to stop a Chinese student doing an oil change on his Focus.
5142 2018-02-18 19:33:33 Only I would be making bacon and have oil pop right into my eyeball.....
5143 2018-02-18 19:33:31 Your such a con man. Still selling snake oil.
5144 2018-02-18 19:33:31 Caution this may leave 1/2 quart of oil on your pants
5145 2018-02-18 19:33:29 One of my mentors is cartoonishly arab. Her idea of date night with her husband was to go *olive oil tasting*. 

If she was any more arab, she'd just be 3 bags of pita bread in a hijab.
5146 2018-02-18 19:33:19 Our beloved ate chairs, bean bags, oil paintings, wooden spoons......you name it. He finally gave up when he was 18 months old. Hobbes was with us 16 years. The first 16 months were worth the pain.

5149 2018-02-18 19:32:18 Have they also banned oil leaks on that paving?
5150 2018-02-18 19:32:14 Of course not, this is list of excuses offered by COLLABORATORS, but American billionaires propping up Trump share Putin's belief in government by oligarchy...and benefit from oil energy dependence as much as Russia.
5151 2018-02-18 19:32:06 Saudi Arabia was framed and tamed, Chavez was right and so is Maduro, their country, it is oil of the Venezuelan so also all other resources, no depraved, salacious oil barons and oil giants connected to foreign governments will come reign and buy their way into Venezuelan wealth
5152 2018-02-18 19:32:05 @BjornLomborg you badly discredit yourself when you include renewables with a small % of TOTAL global energy. Green energy is IN electricity generation - whereas 55% of oil is consumed in transportation fuels. @MLiebreich

5155 2018-02-18 19:31:28 Canadians are such nice people to give the Trudeau's another vacation for his family and friends. Mean while I hear western provinces are in a trade war over an oil pipeline. A great leader you have there.
5156 2018-02-18 19:31:20 Indian refiners dropped 17% of their imports from #Iran(to about 443kbd). We expect Iran #Oil export to India rise to 500kbd in 2018-mid2019. They have signed term contracts for this volume.
5157 2018-02-18 19:31:14 Read about piezo-electric roads; movement caused by transition of cars turned into electricity and returned to cars by induction. Would never eliminate the need for a charge at some point but would help. Huge investment required, and of course the oil companies to placate.
5158 2018-02-18 19:31:10 Not with you or @MarleyNatural on this.  palm oil demand regardless of organic or fair trade puts pressure on  the much larger conventional market and the environmental disaster that is palm oil Appreciate ur honesty but a better bad thing is still bad.

5162 2018-02-18 19:30:37 Dear Global Oil Industry, could you pls donate 2c/barrel you produce toward a fund to stop further development of the CAN oilsands. It's fair compensation as we'd prefer 4c/b & will allow our PM his sun-kissed holidays in winter.

5171 2018-02-18 19:28:58 @realDonaldTrump has been laundering money for the Russian mafia (their government and oil industry) since the 1980s.  Obama expelled nationalists for election meddling, seized compounds, and brought sanctions. Trump tried to give compounds back, and hasn’t implemented sanctions.

 But those countries don't count, because although they've more oil ..well....  you wouldn't want to live there would you?
5236 2018-02-18 19:19:52 The amount of fear/mongering over the curriculum rewrite is appalling. My daughter deserves a public education free of political bias. And it’s not the ATA attempting to affect the rewrite by demanding a specific messaging on the oil sands. #ableg
5237 2018-02-18 19:19:44 Trump's been sold on #EnergyDominance ie Oil-as-Commodity market & dollar as global reserve currency backed by US shale oil & $ accounting.

5242 2018-02-18 19:19:09 No. Think about how stupid it is to use primary energy to compare technologies: the more inefficient coal, gas, oil and nuclear are, the more solar, hydro or wind you need to get to any specific share. Only share of electricity or share of final energy make any sense at all.

5249 2018-02-18 19:18:17 Baba Ghannoug, Falafel, Hummus, Salad, Cheese, and sometimes ful with tahini and olive oil. All of this on one meal? That's a perfect recipe for disaster!
5250 2018-02-18 19:18:09 It’s been under a carpet for about 30 years! Possibly it was made just before that in some treatment oil.

5271 2018-02-18 19:13:42 This time, for first time ever, ATA is full partner in curriculum writing and is appointing folks to write it. I am against that, just as I was against oil sands reps and computer reps influencing it in 2013-15. No special interest group should write it.

5298 2018-02-18 19:10:13 No. I don’t support a pipeline carrying your dirty oil that likely can never be cleaned. I also don’t believe it is in the national interest. Only that of the oil companies. Your statement is ridiculous! #NoPipelinesNoTankers
5299 2018-02-18 19:09:56 Maybe also some cutting oil. Love that smell!

5301 2018-02-18 19:09:28 Should be asking why they are not afforded protection the same way money and other valuables are protected. Sickness of society is problem
5302 2018-02-18 19:09:24 They’d do it for palm oil, but sure, why not vibranium  .
5303 2018-02-18 19:09:12 Per overthecap Wolford has $198,626 dead money and they can save $1,905,000 bu cutting

Ward has $1,114,472 dead cap so I'm sure he stays for another season

Calhoun is $480.000 dead cap. So Calhoun is probably gone, unless they can oil and loosen up this rusty, stiff robot up

5305 2018-02-18 19:09:00 Quick #FireSafetyTip - in case of a cooking fire, slide a pan over the flames to smother a grease or oil fire, then turn off the heat and leave the lid in place until the pan cools. Never carry the pan outside.
5306 2018-02-18 19:08:52 I used salt & olive oil on my hands so they're not to bad. Had a bobble hat on all afternoon!
5307 2018-02-18 19:08:50 The lemongrass coconut body oil from #TraderJoes is all that! Smells amazing, priced cheap and feels great.

It’s crazy how much this place has upped their personal care game.

5310 2018-02-18 19:08:17 Followed everyone !!!!!!!!!!!!!
5311 2018-02-18 19:08:14 So thanks for asking me question. In no way would I suggest ATA should not have hired Suzuki. But if ATA members give an anti Oil Sands crusader a standing O, it does raise questions for me (again) about whether ATA appointees can be trusted to be apolitical in curriculum.
5312 2018-02-18 19:08:12 Oil licence fees.

5318 2018-02-18 19:07:11 I plan to vote for candidates who support gun control, are against the NRA, prefer DACA over a border wall, support the FBI, protect consumers and environment, prefer Solar to oil, support minorities, women and children. Support health care for all, allow individual birth control

5326 2018-02-18 19:06:36 @LBC Clive, legalising Cannabis Oil for medical use in UK is inevitable... Let’s get it out to the people who need it. 
5327 2018-02-18 19:06:17 Yes ...oil ...damn scots causing trouble again ..yes we prop up those but it is  not just america..its every nations government to an extent..but every nation and 99% of its citizens are enslaved to debt.  This is how the central banks have orchestrated it and want it
5328 2018-02-18 19:06:08 He did medal. I didn't read the piece. Just wanted to point out that he medaled. 

"Normalize" & "glorify"... Bud, you might want to take a look at what's been normalized in USA. It's bullets to the heart & hatred, not homosexual heretics & the mass threat of male-male cuddling.
5329 2018-02-18 19:06:05 It wasnt Obama and it wasn't our money. It was Iran's money we froze. We didn't want to pay more interest and we as the U.S.A are not thieves! You however suggested we go for the oil steal and keep it!
5330 2018-02-18 19:05:45

5334 2018-02-18 19:04:52 Americans are being hoodwinked by a snake oil salesman that promises them the world.

5337 2018-02-18 19:04:04 Right. Imagine if I gave you 1 usd backed by gold, but we agree to settle all accounts in dollars. Then the price of gold goes up. How is that 1dollar then worth less? It isn't, obviously. Dollars can't seriously be backed by oil.
5338 2018-02-18 19:04:04 I love coconut oil for everything else but that stuff is NOT meant for your face..at least not mine
5339 2018-02-18 19:03:50 Haan. Woh toh uske leader ne baja daali barabar ki jabki unke pass highest oil reserves hai. Andha dhun corruption kara.

5344 2018-02-18 19:03:09 i used to put so much tea tree oil on my face in school before i realised it made my whole face shiny
5345 2018-02-18 19:03:07 Sure Turkey bought most of the illegal oil from IS when they controlled the oilfields, and the support they got around the Turkish border helped them last waaaay longer than they should have
5346 2018-02-18 19:02:53 And it wasn’t because of that coconut oil, black soap, windex with lemon and baking soda nonsense that dermatologist Twitter suggested 
5347 2018-02-18 19:02:37 The amount of unsecured USD debt the US owes to be settled in "energy as a service" would require 60+ yrs of 100% of global oil supplies at 96m b/d

5353 2018-02-18 19:02:10 76$ for an oil change
5354 2018-02-18 19:02:09 Pake extra virgin olive oil, merknya boleh apa aja di supermarket banyak kok
5355 2018-02-18 19:02:05 In other words, they’re pouring oil on the fire.

Because ‘clearly’, teachers are the best people trained to deal with school shootouts, right?
5356 2018-02-18 19:01:50 Why would the @ukhomeoffice allow a young boy to use Cannabis Oil to live a better life when their duty is to protect the big pharma companies, when the rest of the western world has legalised it the pompous twits in Parliament will still keep it Illegal.
5357 2018-02-18 19:01:44 The price to do an oil change on my bmw is to damn high. 
5358 2018-02-18 19:01:44 If you're disgusted by the GOP, which serves Trump like loyalist, how could you possibly like Trump? He shows no compassion for America, he's nothing more than a snake oil salesman, with no political background at all.

5362 2018-02-18 19:01:30 Is this the bit where you claim that the UK oil fields are Scottish and thus Scots are entitled to a higher per capita spend on public services than the rUK?
5363 2018-02-18 19:01:27 Scrub. Shower. Wash Hair. Coconut Oil Up.
5364 2018-02-18 19:01:14 Apparently your man crush clicks on the links to those beard growth oil ads.
5365 2018-02-18 19:01:02 Hardly, it’s one of the most powerful hand cleaners known to man. It removes oil without even breaking sweat. Also it looks like Godzilla snot..... x
5366 2018-02-18 19:00:49 The truth tho. So the unlikeliest people are basically having to step up and fill the void. You’ve got like oil barons going “I’m not signing another check until you do something about guns”.

Healthcare is paid for instead of fighter jets. We build water pipelines instead of oil, and they make power all the way.

5375 2018-02-18 18:59:54 It certainly is a great tree. Never thought of biodiesel. We are on small islands so we may not have enough trees for that (?) but there is a small operation that makes oil for medicinal purposes. It really helps wounds heal quickly and reduces scarring.
5376 2018-02-18 18:59:15 WHTPW5: WTI Oil rose +4.45% to $61.68/barrel this past week (up +2.63% this year) #Oil #Commodities #Energy
5377 2018-02-18 18:59:00 I prefer blanching in 375 degree peanut oil.
5378 2018-02-18 18:58:36 It would start by NOT handing out $2.6 billion to other countries in climate change financing. If we have that kind of surplus cash I would spend it here on research and development in Canada to provide financially responsible alternative prior to playing  Joan or Ark on coal/oil
5379 2018-02-18 18:58:27 The best way to avoid vendor lock-in when buying a new car is to instead buy a bike. A bike doesn’t need oil change, charge, can buy tires anywhere, no regular dealer visits....

5388 2018-02-18 18:56:44 Instead we doubled down on oil and gas by pushing fracking globally in an attempt to wage an economic war against them, Iran, and Venezuela, who cares that lowering the cost of polluting energy sources will increase their usage, the planet likes it dirty!
5389 2018-02-18 18:56:28 To be fair, those Olympic athletes went all in on the politics first. Don’t attack if you can’t take the blowback. As far as the students, people need to lay off them. IMHO
5390 2018-02-18 18:56:26 Before the people of a nation invite persons of cultures that are extremely foreign to their own worldview, a conference needs to occur between the two factions to devise a coping strategy.
Oil and water don't mix?  Nonsense!  just requires vigorous whisking ~
5391 2018-02-18 18:56:24 I've seen this episode of 'Dancing with the GOP'!
Is this the one where they invade a country for oil, but say it's to avenge 9/11?
Or the one where an American-born citizen attacks an Orlando nightclub, so they push for an immigration ban?
Show sucks: plot lines too repetitive.

5394 2018-02-18 18:55:54 i think i'm gonna start using castor oil bc i haven't been pulling lately but my brows are still sparse.. sigh.. has anyone here used it, got any tips, etc
5395 2018-02-18 18:55:41 I was just thinking about that. I would use Tung oil 5 to 7 coats. I made an oak drain board which got wet every day for years and it worked fine. With something that size, it's likely to have small cracks as it dries out. Tung oil can be touched up

5422 2018-02-18 18:54:30 So was Will's tweet. Cuz he is already a bleeping medalist.
5423 2018-02-18 18:54:05 All I know is our oil is up 70 dollars z barrel do you know ! What you worrying aboot we will be gone soon you can keep the money you allege we suck from you. But you couldn't even point out one part of England big wealth that will keep it when we go ? You don't know lol fkn sad

5426 2018-02-18 18:53:40 I applied Scotsman suntan oil - SPF 500 - and still burned.
5427 2018-02-18 18:52:59 if olive oil is made from olives what baby oil made from
5428 2018-02-18 18:52:53 Yes dude!! I figured that a fuckin’ hydrating mud mask w/ coconut oil would be soothing, not give me 2nd degree face burns  I should check reviews next time.
5429 2018-02-18 18:52:51 Not sure what Murphy talked about either. We do know that at height of pipeline crises, ATA members gave standing ovation to leading anti-oil sands crusader who talked explicitly about keeping oil sands in the ground.

5432 2018-02-18 18:52:08 i don’t remember the coconut oil i sent but the clay it’s good , you can use it for your hair and face .
5433 2018-02-18 18:52:02 Depends on the individual. I have one friend who is willing pick meat out of a sauce, but another friend who will not eat any cheese that isn't explicitly listed as using  vegetarian rennet. And palm oil is increasingly becoming an item to exclude
5434 2018-02-18 18:51:49 What the hell?? That makes no sense omg, are they defos meaning same oil as meat and not just egg based stuff?? That’s mad
5435 2018-02-18 18:51:42 Glad! Sailing up the Amazon in the 70ties all the way up to Iquitos (and passing those oil and logging companies barges and camps) I had wondered if this wonder, this beauty would be still there when I am old

5437 2018-02-18 18:51:33 IranAir has already received dozens of new aircrafts.

Whose money is frozen? US sanctions can't freeze İranian airlines money in Iran. All of them owe tons of money to Civil Aviation authority and Irani Oil company for jet fuel. They need to find the money to pay them first.
5438 2018-02-18 18:51:30 I don't know about others. I hate organized groups.
I also hate a lot of things this country does like spying on people here and abroad and starting wars that kill innocent people just to get oil and money.
Obama had his faults. He's not potus now.
5439 2018-02-18 18:51:28 Well that’s quite the predicament, but an easy fix. Try boiling some water then put it in a bowl. Place the bottle of beard oil in the bowl and let it sit there until it melts back to its original state.

5444 2018-02-18 18:50:37 Doesn’t matter when we still subsidize dirty industries. We give oil companies money to keep killing the planet.

5446 2018-02-18 18:50:33 Yeah that makes sense but like Iona and I just went to a place and we had ordered salt and chilli tofu and some veg dishes and we were pretty much asked to leave because it's all done in the same oil and "not vegan" but vegetarian? Pretty pissed about it haha
5447 2018-02-18 18:50:27 Nothing last forever
5448 2018-02-18 18:50:18 tell me what the total tax take from your ageing, depleting oil and gas stocks were last year? Do you even know

5450 2018-02-18 18:50:08 #Shine4EUCos the multinational oil & gas companies need the money & fuck the environment. You really are a pretentious deluded twat, aren't you? Thought of joining the Tory party?
5451 2018-02-18 18:49:55 ❝Might have some of that in the attic. Look there, you might find some old canvasses and paint, oil paint.❞

She replied softly, peering over her shoulder to find Crookshanks asleep as well. It was evening after all, and what good do cats after a long walk? She cleared her ━
5452 2018-02-18 18:49:50 Congrats Entrepreneur. Abeg who sabi Palm oil producers o. I want to venture into its distribution. Help a brother please.

5454 2018-02-18 18:49:44 Holland and Barrett sold out of Cannabis oil... Is this what we need for the drug to get decriminalised? it's a statement and a very big one at that
5455 2018-02-18 18:49:42 Allocation of finite resources. A favorite talking point when requesting funding and generally the excuse used for failure, until now.
5456 2018-02-18 18:49:39 Opium is one of their biggest exports we have oil here and in Canada. Revolutionary groups such as alkida were burning the fields to revolt againt8 their government. Reasons the U.S stepped in. There's opium in anything from advil to vikidin. Our money maker.
5457 2018-02-18 18:49:20 You do nothing? Well you call him "Nazi Soros" even though he was a Jewish child who escaped the holocaust and whose family resisted the Nazi occupation in Hungary.

Meantime the Koch brothers influence politics while using money that's come from their father's Nazi oil refinery.

5467 2018-02-18 18:47:28 Frfr  I Been Using Oil
5468 2018-02-18 18:47:28 mi pueblo Natal, 18 años desde que estuve por ultima vez 
la escuela donde estudie primaria "Escuela Socony #1" (de la Mobile Oil Company de Vzla) no la reconoci en una foto que me enviaron, parece un mercado. Tan bella que era con hermosos jardines y canchas multi-usos
5469 2018-02-18 18:47:10 I cook mine in corn oil and don't use butter. It also has to be white popcorn. I do not like the yellow kind. Wow! I'm not sure I would like me if I met me! I sound like a bitch!!

5471 2018-02-18 18:46:59 First car I ever had I filled the oil right to the brim In ASDA car park. You could seen the cloud from Ireland! Fuckin minter man 
5472 2018-02-18 18:46:56 It doesn't matter to him, remembered him wanting to take over the oil fields of Iraq. He's never paid some contractors what he owed them and coned many in his trump university
5473 2018-02-18 18:46:49 “I gotta change some oil” @MoFoChance20
5474 2018-02-18 18:46:35 big oil hates renewables, biggest wallets in oil, without the greed being tempered, alternatives are just for innovators
5475 2018-02-18 18:46:35 I almost used honey as cooking oil thinking it was cooking oil. 
5476 2018-02-18 18:46:26 FYI-  all the tax dollars you savd apparently from oil.  Culd not save your litle oil town #FortMac when it burned down.  Where was the money you guys all talking about you saved for your citizens? Still was not enough to help save even a small town by yourselves. #honest #truth
5477 2018-02-18 18:46:20 The nra is actually not in the top 50 of  lobby’s In Washington .. scary as that is . It is considered “top10 just as a category .. falling behind realty , oil , media , pharma , and medics 

As far as $ tho it’s not in top 50
5478 2018-02-18 18:46:13 I know MacKinnon's back today but it looks like the Oil opened anywhere from +135-130 and even tho they are bad, the Avs just aren't that good
5479 2018-02-18 18:45:51 I love what castor oil does to my hair 
5480 2018-02-18 18:45:46 I've read it. I learned that [1] we contribute to a reduction in emissions by increasing emissions via export of oil sands bitumen; [2] that TM is a tradeoff for Alberta signing on to carbon tax, but when @jkenney likely wins, we will have TM & no carbon tax. Amazing, all right.
5481 2018-02-18 18:45:43 I can’t with myself I literally just bought this sweater for work and I already got oil stains on it FML. 
5482 2018-02-18 18:45:13 Got a notification that last night drunk me ordered beard oil on amazon
5483 2018-02-18 18:45:12 No that was a long time ago   Now all the shit is over. Oil and  other countries trying to get rid of the US dollar as the national  currency
5484 2018-02-18 18:45:12 I think when the talk of players in the media help when, like the Talbot case, it reaches epic proportions. The league has an issue that needs to be addressed. May not help the Oil today, but time will tell.
5485 2018-02-18 18:45:07 Snake oil is a great game to play with strangers
5486 2018-02-18 18:45:01 Speaking of oil i have to make a batch this week
5487 2018-02-18 18:44:49 can I be that person who professionally rubs oil on girl models booties??
5488 2018-02-18 18:44:43 big picture DXY at 100 would still suggests its in a multi decade decline and is very possible. Im expecting $ shortage to arise from equity market/oil market crash causing hard rally in the dollar before the 'end game' is really here
5489 2018-02-18 18:44:42 Is the Snake Oil bible available for purchase on Amazon?  This is hilarious!
5490 2018-02-18 18:44:20 I picked up bath salt, baby oil, and batteries from the store. The cashier commented on what looks like a random assortment. I told her I like to shop alphabetically.
5491 2018-02-18 18:44:15 I get sneaking feeling Labour don’t know they already own gas and oil.
5492 2018-02-18 18:44:12 Hey @POTUS  this one is for you POP before Malcolm and I help moms neighbor get some stuff out of my Grandparents house, remember me talking about OIL for USA well ask @joshgroban for I passed him all the rights Y bc you are trying to take Music/ARTS from our children, well hear
5493 2018-02-18 18:44:06 I gotta get a whole ass oil change. I’m annoyedddddd!
5494 2018-02-18 18:44:00 We agree there are adverse effects - and there are benefits. Many of the adverse effects can be mitigated. Vehicle emissions regs did a lot; as did redesign of tires (yes!) for improved efficiency. The question is, in context, are AB oil sands per se causing specific health probs
5495 2018-02-18 18:43:55 Gonna try the coconut oil today ...just a little bit
5496 2018-02-18 18:43:44 Russia can't  properly run their own country or drill oil or feed their people how could they interfer in Americans  election #Russia #RedWaveRising2018
5497 2018-02-18 18:43:34 They seem to believe that there will be strong demand for oil until at least 2040. After that, they can walk away and leave us with the mess (and the destabilized climate).
5498 2018-02-18 18:43:19 We are looking for stockist/wholesale/retail
 of our purest CBD Full Spectrum oil all over UK and Europe.  Please ring/text 07837788551 for prices.

5500 2018-02-18 18:43:03 What was the fail tag, seven seas cod liver oil and fortified wine
5501 2018-02-18 18:42:44 I think peak oil may be behind us. I really don’t know for sure, but yes, production will dwindle. They use water for fracking. Add toxic chemicals and then they inject it back into the earth. They pay nothing in the present and ruin our future. It’s a unicorn of capitalism.
5502 2018-02-18 18:42:27 Muchos seudo expertos compartiendo desinformación. #FakeNews 
Ya es hora  y comenzar a confrontar a estos SNAKE OIL SALESMEN en redes...

5504 2018-02-18 18:42:11 You tories have very short memories what about 100 plus billion needed to save your bank account and what about the tories exchange rate mechanism fiasco which cost us 300 million, and what about the boom years of oil squandered on mass unemployment remember UB40 1in10
5505 2018-02-18 18:42:10 Yes. As an example I was an IT manager for a major independent oil company, recently retired very early to enjoy life. I voted leave, as did a large number of my peers. We have a tendency to foresee the future. You have no argument, Amagogotya with the very silly hashtag acronym.
5506 2018-02-18 18:42:07 Tai Lopez = Modern day snake oil salesman
5507 2018-02-18 18:41:54 Now only is he a white supremacist, he continues to be a land grabber, too.  He's wanting the remaining lands that the Native Americans are on, because he KNOWS that there is oil underneath a great deal of it!  GREED/CORRUPTION/POWER/HATRED/DESTRUCTION is his goals!

5509 2018-02-18 18:41:42 HGV driver friend of mine says a company in Huddersfield are looking to recruit extra drivers with ADR certificate. Can only be Hoyer? Ready for #ukog #oil at #BroadfordBridge #weald

5511 2018-02-18 18:41:14 Someone should hook him up with CBD oil and dare the police to charge his family.
5512 2018-02-18 18:41:08 I think somewhere shouldn’t be able to call do it and call it veg but if ur veggie/vegan and eat it cooked in the same oil I don’t think it’s bad bc better environmentally anyway, if that makes sense ??
5513 2018-02-18 18:41:01 Sunday. Coconut hair oil day. Like I’m back in the pind.
5514 2018-02-18 18:40:59 よし！寝られる！
5515 2018-02-18 18:40:56 If you told high school me that i became the girl who starts her mornings slathered in essential oils with a mouthful of coconut oil and that I would workout 4+ times a week, I probably would’ve laughed in your face
5516 2018-02-18 18:40:44 Only the fringe (30%) voters and President Putin share that opinion with you... The rest of us tire of you snake oil BS.
5517 2018-02-18 18:40:42 Yup. Boomers ruined everything with their unsustainable consumption of land, oil, health, education, gluten, and high fructose corn syrup.
5518 2018-02-18 18:40:35 괜찮아요 어차피 죽은애 신경안쓰셔도 됩니다
5519 2018-02-18 18:40:22 Vinegar salad dressings are too strong, and I'm off oil. Squeezing part of a fresh orange over greens is my go to dressing now.  It's yummy.

5526 2018-02-18 18:39:43 All objections against the Communistic mode of producing, however for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.
5527 2018-02-18 18:39:41 They need a crowdfunding page set up so they can go and stay over in usa taking the oil and if it works they can give proof to the gov

5532 2018-02-18 18:38:56 There's a SPIRIT behind everything or anything. Nigerians challenges are spiritual. #ActionNow. Is blood physical? Blood bank in Nigeria is more than oil bloc in Biafra land.
5533 2018-02-18 18:38:56 Oil produced anywhere is a slow moving environmental disaster.

5535 2018-02-18 18:38:50 Why in the F'n F does the environment boy need to leave the country? His job has a very domestic focus, except for dropping out of protocols and sucking big oil derricks.

5539 2018-02-18 18:37:54 Looking forward to the blog post as well.  I would argue personally that the '80s oil price crash and the Third World Debt crisis was the elimination of the counterweight.  Or your point might be that there never was a counterweight,  Soooo...I'll read on...
5540 2018-02-18 18:37:20 These engines don't like non low saps oil that's why turbos Shit themselves non low saps causes turbo to soot up

5549 2018-02-18 18:36:47 Not at all. I just say it's important to teach history frm perspective of colonized & immigrants & celebrate their contributions-in art,culture,$$, blood, oil etc to development of #UK & vice versa.Most of us our proud of our fusion identities-in my case Iranian/Brit.
5550 2018-02-18 18:36:31 Me: is there such a thing as black gold??
Tyler: yeah, it’s called oil.
5551 2018-02-18 18:36:29 US vs Russian in Syria.

It's all a plan to get Iran to play. Iran vs Israel is what they want. Then the US will pounce on Iran. 
Make War, Take Oil.

The first earth day was April 22, 1970.  It was created by U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson who was inspired by a 1969 huge oil spill in Santa Barbara, California.  He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton for the creation of earth day.

5564 2018-02-18 18:33:54 Also turmeric powder and honey works effectively. Turmeric removes excess oil while honey moisturises
5565 2018-02-18 18:33:54 Question for any Vegan, Veggie friends. If vegetarian options are fried/cooked in the same oil as meat products is it even vegetarian?

5576 2018-02-18 18:32:25 Although you arrogantly say it's a rhetorical question, here's a real answer Andrew.

If Canada doesn't fully develop & share our Oilsands now, we will become a takeover target with no holds barred as world oil reserves are exhausted. Hence Canada national interest to do #TMX.
5577 2018-02-18 18:32:12 Or big oil or big pharma  or big banks . Enough already.

5585 2018-02-18 18:30:52 I shall be anointed with FRESH OIL!!
5586 2018-02-18 18:30:46 ok so if this stands up how does that explain all those offshore ties to oil? Is she playing it both ways? I'm confused here over in the oil sands and now I'm greasy too.
5587 2018-02-18 18:30:39 Yeah, Canucks & oilers fans = natural enemies, but I’m a big CMD fan & wd love to see the Oil win. Just annoyed (& a bit jealous tbh) at how incompetent mgmt was to be in position to draft & piss away so much great talent. Unfortunately, my team is looking at a dark decade ahead.
5588 2018-02-18 18:30:35 I think it's not the same type of oil - Holland and Barrett sell legal hemp oil - it's not the full spectrum stuff which is illegal and the type that that little boy needs
5589 2018-02-18 18:30:34 For your eyes you can try baby oil. But with the foundation all I can say is scrub scrub scrub 
5590 2018-02-18 18:30:19 That was then, and this is now.  The article was ridiculous...and so are you.
5591 2018-02-18 18:30:04 Like a diamond in a coal bin
5592 2018-02-18 18:29:56 Idk if you put oil on your hair but I would put oil on my ponytail before using the gel and it didn’t flake up
5593 2018-02-18 18:29:53 I’ve no idea! It looks like oil rather than varnish. It’s the same texture as the rest of the wood but just darker. It’s now been exposed for five days and hasn’t faded at all.
5594 2018-02-18 18:29:44 Lol
5595 2018-02-18 18:29:09 Last time I put oil in, the turbo exploded and hit the engine, long story but cost 4.5k to fix it, hence my fear here 
5596 2018-02-18 18:29:06 Also happens here in Brazil. But some families created a network of people to give the hemp and made by themselves the oil and distribute. Maybe it's the only way his family can give him a better life.
5597 2018-02-18 18:28:58 Oil industry too big
5598 2018-02-18 18:28:57 Knife no, bag of fertilizer and some fuel oil, he could have exceeded 17.
5599 2018-02-18 18:28:48 Struggle to explain? No struggle: poorly coached, poorly managed.
5600 2018-02-18 18:28:41 Cows vs. Cars: milk vs. oil
5601 2018-02-18 18:28:36 cannabis oil works stopped 4 years of nerve pain in 3 doses over 3 days would put an end to countless prescription charges
5602 2018-02-18 18:28:34 My Burmese Candy went Missing twice Lisa. 
2 and then 3 nights! We went knocking on doors. She came screaming back through the door covered in engine oil obviously locked in a shed or garage? Hopefully he will be back soon.
5603 2018-02-18 18:28:30 Vauxhall meriva, it's got a code error on the dash, it's a oil warning, the dipstick is not far off the max though
5604 2018-02-18 18:27:51 That Bhicken need some coconut oil
5605 2018-02-18 18:27:30 Drink Ya Water, Eat Ya Fruit & Coconut Oil Ya Body Down... That’s Damn Near Law
5606 2018-02-18 18:27:21 I found this article for you: 

 The Dollar’s Historically Negative Relationship With Oil Has Flipped
5607 2018-02-18 18:27:11 Mom said that may help. Mom is also suggesting lemon oil, too.
5608 2018-02-18 18:27:03 If it aint for greed of oil & other natural resources then I bet there would be total peace everywhere. Unfortunately these two things are the main reasons for war, killings and unrest in the world. Leaders who r spreading war for these two main resources are themselves not sure
5609 2018-02-18 18:26:54 Imaginary Suzuki speech at the Olympics: How did you people get here? Don't plan on flying home. Also, no more ski events, bobsled events, hockey games or skating events. All use petrochemical-based gear. Since oil must stay in the ground, Olympics are over. Have a nice day.
5610 2018-02-18 18:26:42 I keep thinking that the only interest of the Russians is to derail renewable energy... derail the Paris Agreement to save their bread and butter, oil and gas.  Trump did that, but ended up alone.
5611 2018-02-18 18:26:29 Yes, b/c u know what goes on in each and every classroom in AB. And no teachers have friends, spouses, neighbors, or family members in the oil and gas industry. 
5612 2018-02-18 18:26:18 Caroli_CL I just blitzed various herbs with garlic, a couple of preserved lemons, a tiny bit of their juice and some oil (based on a mint and preserved lemon sauce in At My Table, which isn’t online, I’m afraid
5613 2018-02-18 18:26:07 FYI-  all the tax dollars you savd apparently from oil.  Culd not save your litle oil town #FortMac when it burned down.  Where was the money you guys all talking about you saved for your citizens? Still was not enough to help save even a small town by yourselves. #honest #truth

5615 2018-02-18 18:26:03 sorry i can’t make it out today, i exhausted all of my energy trying to put on my duvet cover.
5616 2018-02-18 18:25:54 I'll bet you employees in Florida's Mental Health depts. are burning midnight oil on this one. Get ducks in a row & take what comes.
5617 2018-02-18 18:25:44 Dr. Painter, Can we get Big Money out of politics and the lobbyist such as; NRA, Big Pharma, & Oil & Gas companies, and return it to the People?? How do we do this?? Thank you for speaking the Truth!!
5618 2018-02-18 18:25:29 I'm going to have to get a deep fryer when I get some dosh. Determined to make my own fish and chips & fritters. What's the name of that 'healthy' oil?
5619 2018-02-18 18:25:22 It's only on oil treated wood though. Granny recommends a doily
5620 2018-02-18 18:25:21 now if ever there was a guy that could waste taxpayer dollars!
spent $50million to prove clinton involvement in whitewater and eventually settled for a blow job!
a fine example of another oil company lackey.
5621 2018-02-18 18:25:16 Dont know if you found a way but maybe naggaroth night, nuln oil followed by a layer of pink horror and then fulgrim pink
5622 2018-02-18 18:25:16 In 1941, Interior Minister Miguel Aleman announces that after the settlement of the expropriation question foreign capital will be permitted to participate in the development of new oil fields.
5623 2018-02-18 18:25:13 All #Putin has to do is 'Sell Out #Trump' with enough evidence to the #USA that #Trump is a #RussianAgentSpy, and he can keep the OIL he promised #TrumpRussiaCrimeFamily!
5624 2018-02-18 18:25:01 Pro tip: Go get a nice mascara like Better Than Sex, use all of it. Every last drop. Then, take the wand and clean it with eye make up remover or Jojoba oil (the oil of God himself) and use it on any drugstore brand. The wand really helps. My favorite is a tie between Maybelline
5625 2018-02-18 18:24:44 And more specifically, helping the countries that Russia exports oil and gas to get renewable energy independence.
5626 2018-02-18 18:24:42 the fact that they are thrown boiling hot oil while still alive is horrible

5631 2018-02-18 18:23:15 Body transformation hurts! This strength training I’ve put myself through. How to reduce muscle soreness? More protein shake and I’ve got to get myself some essential oil rubs.
5632 2018-02-18 18:23:00 Tire preplacement, alignment, oil change, air filter replacement, fuel injector cleaning and need new wipers too. I hate being an adult and having to spend my gah damn money

5635 2018-02-18 18:22:52 Need to put oil in the car, I've a tub of 5w 30 part synthetic. When I Google it, it says I need 5w 30 FULLY synthetic. Is there any difference? @JohncarC 
5636 2018-02-18 18:22:50 Who wants transparency when you can have magic? Who wants prose when you can have poetry? Pull away the veil and what are you left with? Ordinary, modest ability, little imagination. Wrap them up like this, anoint them with oil and what do you have? Gods and goddesses. #EEBAFTAs
5637 2018-02-18 18:22:49 You are forgetting about the oil field anvil the YPG holds.
5638 2018-02-18 18:22:44 could’ve sworn I JUST got my damn oil changed.
5639 2018-02-18 18:22:32 Have you considered a daily dose of anointing oil?

5641 2018-02-18 18:22:26 There are plenty of safe places to buy canines oil. Just do it. Save your son. Start a Just Give page for him. I will donate. The doctors are to scared of the wealthy drugs barons oops sorry drugs companies.
5642 2018-02-18 18:22:11 Blotus' golden goose is cooked! 
My thoughts exactly on Friday per Rosenstein's remarks re THIS indictment.  The Intel plus ALL of his public statements & actions years ago re a presidential run while playing with RU just deep-fries his ass in boiling oil.
5643 2018-02-18 18:21:57 @BBCNews pharmaceutical companies NHS and government prevent the use of medical cannabis and oil
5644 2018-02-18 18:21:35 YPG WITH SAA AND RUSSIA TURK NOT ATTACK,USA WANT OIL AND GAS FIELD
5645 2018-02-18 18:21:33 มันเพิ่งเริ่ม และมันต้องดีขึ้นไปเรื่อยๆ มาลองสู้กันดูนะ ‘ระยะทาง’ 
5646 2018-02-18 18:21:09 Another reason to see #Kratom stay legal, its sourced from those same forests and provides alot of farmers a crop to sell without more resorting to joining the Palm Oil industry in Indonesia and Malaysia.
5647 2018-02-18 18:21:05 I’d say yes, as pig oil rubs off. It’s good stuff so can’t hurt to try!
5648 2018-02-18 18:20:59 Shes okay at the mo no pain im nlt putting her through Chemo shes too old but started her on cbd oil and a raw diet so £2600 later after CT scan etc atleast we know now

I just hope people who do dump them or do bad things have a painfull death but doubt it
5649 2018-02-18 18:20:46 Legalise cannabis oil!!! If it works in other countries and it’s safe, it’s safe here!!! Or don’t you want to upset the big pharmaceutical companies!!!
5650 2018-02-18 18:20:44 Not really, nothing shocking there; totally expect and Turkey was quite explicit about it, announcing it well in advance as a countermeasure to the US arming of the (secessionist) Kurds with the aim to controlling Syrian oil and gas!

5657 2018-02-18 18:20:09 @AmberRuddHR 
For goodness sake allow the little boy cannabis oil to alleviate his seizes.  If it is good enough in the Netherlands then accept it and give the family licence to use it.
5658 2018-02-18 18:20:08 @ScottPruittOK was a disgrace here in Oklahoma, and I'm sorry that this "climate change isn't real" freak never got a bigger platform.  It was only natural that someone from Oklahoma's Oil and Gas backers would get appointed to something they had no business being in.
5659 2018-02-18 18:20:03 Oil pulling rlly work
5660 2018-02-18 18:20:01 I'm unsurprised but disgusted once again by @ukhomeoffice. Medical cannabis oil reduces the number of seizures suffered by Alfie Dingley (who suffers from an extremely rare form of epilepsy) from ≈30 seizures per day to ≈20 per YEAR.
5661 2018-02-18 18:19:57 Historically campaign specialists meet with foreign governments. NP. Trump campaign was grave threat to Russia lucrative oil economy and military build up-Russia’s 2 top priority.  Y would Russia want Trump over environmentalist, dovish Clinton?
5662 2018-02-18 18:19:47 Oh my gosh!
The worship leader I heard today has RAW OIL. 
Seriously 1 note I was in heaven. 
Oil does it
5663 2018-02-18 18:19:46 @AmberRuddHR blimey; any chance of letting that little lad be a medical field trial for the oil which obviously provides massive relief? Just watched his exhausted Ma on TV making the case. Surely under strong supervision it's worth a go? Have a think on it. Ta. #charlie
5664 2018-02-18 18:19:39 The single most effective thing the US could do to really hit back at Russia would be moving away from oil and gas.
5665 2018-02-18 18:19:34 @BBCNews (ref ) cannabis oil proved to work for parkinsons and Ms legal in 15 states in the US but too much money involved in the UK
5666 2018-02-18 18:19:33 Working in the oil field industry taught me what real money is
5667 2018-02-18 18:19:15 Pipelines should be built across our country so that Alberta oil is supplying each province. Canada should never import oil from other countries. When that is done and all Canada is served, then any additional production will be available for export.
5668 2018-02-18 18:19:14 I can tell you that among Americans here in the States there is absolutely no interest in getting involved in another war, let alone one with an ally. Also, despite the efforts our corrupt government, renewables are quickly outpacing oil as a power source.
5669 2018-02-18 18:19:09 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
5670 2018-02-18 18:19:07 Past proves future (a favorite #QAnon quote) The movie "Knowing," warned abt the coming #DeepHorizon disaster. Movie out B4 disaster. Cage is watching tv, news reports oil spill, camera zooms to a note, focuses in on 666. I saw it all! Their code is real!

5673 2018-02-18 18:18:50 Think symbolically bruh. Wakanda had vibranium and had the means to come help. But they abandoned Killmonger. In real life, Africa’s vibranium is gold, diamonds, oil, etc... all of that has been stolen by white folks. Africa does not have the means to “help” black americans
5674 2018-02-18 18:18:39 It’s on fire because, clearly, it had been covered in some sort of wax or oil that was flammable ^^  Problem solved, Cool saved

5677 2018-02-18 18:18:25 I need to remind myself that although the gun laws in the USA are ridiculous, I’m thankful that I am Canadian and our government although make stupid decisions, ie: healthcare/trudeau spending/ oil pipelines/ treatment of natives etc etc they did get the gun ownership law right!
5678 2018-02-18 18:18:24 They want to take away the oil field bargaining chip. What were the Russian mercs thinking? Did they think no one would notice the bridge? Coalition must have contacted deconfliction and they still refused to stop. Decided to call Coalition hand. Bad call.

5680 2018-02-18 18:17:46 I see the Home Office are still the institution of "We don't want people getting high" by refusing a seriously ill child cannabis oil which can alleviate his symptoms for up to 24 days.
5681 2018-02-18 18:17:29 The little boy who had cannabis oil in Holland...........The Govt won't give him it here.......fucking madness ...Let him  have it for goodness sake

5688 2018-02-18 18:16:06 Please chase after the oil not the gift. 

Gift can bring out the self in you.
Oil brings out the God in you.
5689 2018-02-18 18:16:01 the idea is to divest from fossil fuels, not use pipelines, because the need for oil has vastly reduced, with education, some patience, and the will. Retrain people to help maintain natural sources of energy, ultimately, to stop killing the planet. In a nutshell Jane

5692 2018-02-18 18:15:35 I feel your pain. The water-based products just don't cut it, they still have a long way to go on coverage and application to match oil based. I've had good results with Little Greene & F&B water-based exterior eggshell on new work, but extra coat needed.

You don’t need to be rich to put a smile on someone’s face. His name is chad so if you see him bless him with something
5706 2018-02-18 18:13:30 I bought some clove oil for my tooth today. Oh my God it is strong and instant! You’re not meant to get it on your gums but it’s hard when you put in your mouth. I have numbed my cheek. Magic.

5711 2018-02-18 18:13:05 It seems that the reality being dawned on SA !
Renewable energy is taking away their crude oil market share very fast.
Their economy is in urgent need of diversification.
Current image of the country won’t attract international talents to the country !
Drama unfolding !

5716 2018-02-18 18:12:14 @EnvAgencySE NB Lots of boaters have been travelling up through Tottenham Locks, whilst lot of oil is still in the water, all week. Perhaps put out physical notices telling them not to & reassure them of no licence issues whilst it remains? Or shut Lock.

5719 2018-02-18 18:11:52 It's just his fiduciary responsibility to his employer, big oil, to maximize his carbon footprint.  He'd charter if he thought he could get away with it.
5720 2018-02-18 18:11:47 @iamjoonlee He's also a loser, go back home & practice...& grow up.
5721 2018-02-18 18:11:37 He did not. His just blamed Americans for a) not being “digitally literate” b) being divided. But digital literacy is FBs duty just as its the duty of oil co’s to keep crude out of our seas. And we’ve had divisive elections but never hacked by Russians. FB made that possible.
5722 2018-02-18 18:11:33 Shaved with baby oil so now I’m basically a seal that will probs bleed out
5723 2018-02-18 18:11:30 Even the "olive oil" mayo they sell has canola as the first ingredient (olive was last). They recently went so far as to combine olive and canola so that it appeared first on the label ("Olive and canola oil blend"), but I highly doubt the formula has changed :S
5724 2018-02-18 18:11:25 Don't forget Assad getting the oil fields of Deir Ezzor area, and American SOF having no local allies (ok perhaps they will make arrangements with new #ISIS)
5725 2018-02-18 18:11:11 according to their wiki page when they were in council positions, they had clashes w/ their male counterparts bc they preferred to trade in palm oil >> slaves. women of colour coming thru as usual
5726 2018-02-18 18:11:01 For a guy who’s so closely tied to the game that’s a bullshit response Damien. Look at the PP and Penalty Kill for Oilers. Those are the main issues for the Oil. Yes Talbot has had a bad year but the league and reffing is so god damn inconsistent. Why not call out the league?
5727 2018-02-18 18:10:48 People want the CBD to be healthy not necessarily the THC which makes you high. I love my CBD oil.
5728 2018-02-18 18:10:39 And what about Japan or China or India? Three big countries with no oil resources. Shipping crude thousands of miles in a different direction doesn't make any difference.

5731 2018-02-18 18:10:05  I'm so stressed, I need them away.  Bio oil is a scam
5732 2018-02-18 18:10:05 I understand the angst among alternative energy pro policy peeps. But understand this, the oil sands infrastructure is there to stay. Transportation via any method(ie:trains) will continue unabated with demand. Both can be achieved with co-op. Bickering isn’t helping.

5738 2018-02-18 18:09:20 The bet these companies are making is that agents/brokerages won’t come together to create the tech that controls their own data and creates their own insights. “Data is the new oil” let’s stop selling the mineral rights to our own business #KWFR2018 @kwlasvegas_
5739 2018-02-18 18:09:12 Most of these anti pipeline protesters have never worked in the oil field, and I suspect they are unwittingly being organized by the rail roads.
5740 2018-02-18 18:08:54 Canada produces more oil through conventional practices than the domestic market could ever use!  Oil sands production is an Export only industry!  You are being played!
No rational mind can equate oil sands production with a proactive climate change strategy
5741 2018-02-18 18:08:48 Absolutely! No shame in admitting you can’t (currently) answer a question for whatever reason. But if you can’t provide support, don’t throw oil on the fire just because you think it’s funny.
5742 2018-02-18 18:08:47 What does Russia want from the U.S.? An end to the sanctions; Exxon's help for Arctic oil exploration; protection for their American Steel investments. &They want America off the world stage- out of Cuba, Iran, Libya, Mexico.

5752 2018-02-18 18:07:55 And olive oil stains garments!  Blast, have you ever tried to get an olive oil stain out of a black wool?  Impossible!
5753 2018-02-18 18:07:54 It goes beyond the film industry and performing arts. Same applies in IT, manufacturing, oil refining and even education. They bother NOT and are now the greatest beneficiaries of outsourcing. Demography put to good use.
5754 2018-02-18 18:07:40 Could USW become involved in getting beyond oil and gas pipelines in BC and retool for water pipelines from Alaska to the lower western states? This would have enormous ecological benefits and would keep water on the continent.
5755 2018-02-18 18:07:22 Ohh Vitamin E oil? If you end up trying them let me know how effective it is! 
5756 2018-02-18 18:07:20 Any Beard/Mooch Oil users? 

Which ones better to use from The Man Company, Ustra & Beardo??
5757 2018-02-18 18:07:17 Why? Most Americans agree with you! A lot has to do with Russia’s influence and dividing our nation, the fact that Trump is a snake oil ConMan. Gerrymandering is a reason as well. Plus Fox Fake News! We ask this question every day! Pray for us!
5758 2018-02-18 18:07:10 "if the olive trees knew the hands that planted them,their oil would become tears."
5759 2018-02-18 18:07:10 Apparently teachers need a paycut. Less oil less pay
5760 2018-02-18 18:07:09 What are the oil sands health issues?

5762 2018-02-18 18:06:58 Canada is the largest supplier of oil to America. Towards the end of last year we imported roughly 3.3 million barrels a day. The next closest supplier is Mexico, roughly 800,000 barrels a day. We enjoy the partnership but don’t forget your friends. Canada. 
5763 2018-02-18 18:06:56 The only way to know is to look to the pre colonization period
Definitely we can say that Northern Africa, as part of the Islamic caliphate had the ability 
However Northern Africa is resource dry save oil and gas (Algeria and Libya)

5765 2018-02-18 18:06:46 That's not a scarf but a sausage warmer 
5766 2018-02-18 18:06:28 Standing next to brick wall puts out more radiation than xray. Burning oil & coal puts in the atmosphere constant radiation. Unless humanity stops using energy, the problem putting out radiation is not going away. Just need find safest solution aka Thorium Nuclear Energy.
5767 2018-02-18 18:06:26 I work for an agency that regulates oil field pollution,  and the biggest contributers to spills is the LACK of pipelines.  Oil is stored in tanks and moved with trucks and the tanks overfill,  they vent tremendous amounts of gas, pipelines could prevent all of that.
5768 2018-02-18 18:06:06 Roasted the beets & garlic. Used only a glug of garlic olive oil and used the liquid from the tin to get the consistency.
5769 2018-02-18 18:05:55 That is EXACTLY why I think the oil/cny contract is so underappreciated in terms of relevance.  On its own.. it is one thing.  As a gear in your statement it becomes the turbocharger in the one way slide of USD hegemony.
5770 2018-02-18 18:05:51 I have 170 right now. No issues. My engine just seized..was an oil problem but was also a recall. I was beyond recall and warentee but the dealer did the right thing and paid for the engine.
5771 2018-02-18 18:05:46 It has lactic acid in it as well as glycolic which are both great for evening out the skin tone. I use their rosehip oil in the morning also for my pigmentation too.

5777 2018-02-18 18:03:57 What is a bath melt? Like a bath bomb with oil instead of fizzy or is it like a soap?
5778 2018-02-18 18:03:47 The money we spend is generated through the club and not oil money like City or a stupidly rich owner like Chelsea. We are entitled to spend the money we generate. Even Wenger said that during the Sanchez saga.
5779 2018-02-18 18:03:43 Soooo no oil change placesare open on Sunday's? I'm on a wild goose chase. This is why I need a man. I'm gone go crazy trying to take care of my car
5780 2018-02-18 18:03:27 People with Hispanic hair/ mixed YALL THIS HAIR MASK WAS BOMB AF. Usually if I blow dry or use any heat my curls/waves go straight or weird and ion like it. I used one egg, honey, olive oil, and like 1/3 of a banana. My hair feels so nourished. 
5781 2018-02-18 18:03:26 Trump don't want to do anything about Russia, because he don't want to mess up that 5oo Billion oil deal with Puttin.
5782 2018-02-18 18:02:52 That sucks. This Subaru is only 5 years old and already has a new engine cuz the other one kept burning up oil. And it’s gotten other recalls, but this is the first one that mentioned explosions. So that’s comforting, right?

5784 2018-02-18 18:02:22 Roasted toms and peppers with sea salt and olive oil at least makes a nice starter or side dish. Not much help I know.

5808 2018-02-18 17:58:45 If this bothers you...cut down on your palm oil usage. It is in your soap, cosmetics, food and even used to make fuel. It is a plant native to Africa that is being transplanted to Borneo. Replacing the forests the Orangutans need.

5811 2018-02-18 17:58:27 The premise of sharing wealth in an oil rich country is an admirable ambition. Corbyn supports any policy which would attempt to remove poverty , not create it like Tories. Venezuela is not what it was setup to be. Run by dictators like Saudis
5812 2018-02-18 17:58:03 We even reloaded our rounds  kids don't know anything today !!! They call AAA to change a flat !!! Don't change there own oil... 100 yrs ago you could call one friend to help you with anything... today you have to call 30 people to do something !!!

5825 2018-02-18 17:56:10 AB is demanding we focus more on oil. This leads to inflated dollar, reducing other industries, leading to Dutch Disease.  Further destroying fisheries & tourism only exacerbates. AB is demanding unending increases in crude export, which exacerbates.
Solution: we cap production.

5832 2018-02-18 17:55:26 It’s not the war on terror people. It was the inside job planned by the Bush administration for them to go to your country and get your oil. Get over that fact already. It was their corrupt assess that wanted your oil!!!

5837 2018-02-18 17:54:36 I bought one of those old-skool freestanding oil heaters from Power City, and haven't looked back. It's been absolutely Baltic the last couple of weeks.

5850 2018-02-18 17:52:26 Good call. I've tried it with olive oil, and while it works, it has a distinct flavour to it that doesn't really work w/ yorkies.  Let me know how your toad in the hole works out!

5852 2018-02-18 17:52:10 Raw Shea butter plus coconut oil plus glycerin on my skin feels like heaven 
5853 2018-02-18 17:51:58 It’s more about the long-term with Alberta.  Without the oil and gas tax profits, they lose the majority of their political power, and Alberta becomes a more populated Manitoba.
5854 2018-02-18 17:51:56 I think instant noodles are tasty and like picking up a new and different package of ramen every time I go to the store. Also i like oil painting. Looks like goop
5855 2018-02-18 17:51:49 This oil is so good for my hair, but the way it smells and drips onto my face
5856 2018-02-18 17:51:47 Was soo tasty. In some  grapeseed oil and Tabasco
5857 2018-02-18 17:51:29 I used to put Mayo in my hair. But its just an emulsion of egg and oil so its not too weird
5858 2018-02-18 17:51:22 I dither over one of our beautiful old seats covered with lichen, to pressure wash or not, then had a visitor suggest the seat was a disgrace and that I should buy some teak oil !
5859 2018-02-18 17:51:10 Bruh they at church rubbing olive oil on these folks feet as they get ordained lmao. I’m dead
5860 2018-02-18 17:51:09 Started taking cannabis oil to treat my anxiety. Hopeful for the results 
5861 2018-02-18 17:51:09 Wow boom Get In Rochdale Goal 2-2 What magic #FACup #Magic
5862 2018-02-18 17:51:04 Shipping unrefined oil and bitumen offshore only to buy refined products from foreign producers is nuts.  Yes it’s the easiest way to make a quick buck as we have with pretty much all of our natural resources, but it is only serves the interests of a very few.
5863 2018-02-18 17:50:58 Oil would still be in Nigeria but the world would have moved on to cleaner energy. I think we need to focus our resources on looking for ways to capitalize on cleaner energy. The government of Port Harcourt can spearhead such endeavors.

5865 2018-02-18 17:50:54 Ask the dead Russian mercenaries in Syria
Ask the gas and oil industry in Russia how America on Verge of global energy dominace works for them
Sanctions are not the only tool in the toolbox my friend
5866 2018-02-18 17:50:47 Jackman is a complete snake oil salesman.
5867 2018-02-18 17:50:25 They weren’t selected to go on camera
5868 2018-02-18 17:50:18 Let me break it down for you. I live in  OK. Our republican overlords are so obsessed with giving big oil subsidies & tax breaks that we have 1 of the bottom 5 ed systems in the US. We have 40 kids packed into classrooms w/teachers w/ emergency certifications. Not happening here.
5869 2018-02-18 17:50:18 We have to develop a thick skin. When the Holy Spirit has insulated you, what haters say slide off like oil.  It's good to know how the enemy is working so we can develop strategies to pray and spiritually secure victory.
5870 2018-02-18 17:50:07  Foreal if they added lemon juice and rapeseed oil those chickpeas are basciallt humus. I love humus and I ear weird preggo worthy combos but you won't catch me eating those, mkay.
5871 2018-02-18 17:50:02 IRAN AND RUSSIA IN BED IN SYRIA THEY ALL FALL DOWN. BECAUSE OF OUR ELECTION NONE OF THEM WIN. THEY BETTER WAKE UP. OBAMA & HILLARY USED THEM & LIED TO THEM. WE ARE PUTTING FREEDOM FIRST! CUT THEIR OIL AND WATCH THEM CRY!
5872 2018-02-18 17:50:01 Cuz the trolls also forced her to make decades worth of terrible policy decisions, suck up to Wall St, Monsanto, Big Oil, Big Pharma, and of course they made her reject single payer healthcare and progressives. Those 13 were busy!!!
5873 2018-02-18 17:49:56 Could be authentic, when flying the Saudia DC8 in early 1991 we had to wipe the windscreen after every flight into Dahran.... stick oil at higher altitudes...
5874 2018-02-18 17:49:50 Something America could easily do, we’re it not for the fact that the oil companies have our so-called prez and all of his congress in their pockets.  So trump continues his lie of restoring coal mining and eliminating the environmental protections that were in place before him.
5875 2018-02-18 17:49:49 Can you get high on Olbas Oil? #askingforafriend #bedroomreeks
5876 2018-02-18 17:49:43 You said that you asked Putin if he did it and he said no. And you believed him. 
So, how about those sanctions. I’m sure Putin will still give you a cut of the oil on the North Pole. That’s worth lots more than Trump branding.
5877 2018-02-18 17:49:35 showed of the Middle East, with coloured in the "Iranian Axis"  (Isis was meant too in that map).

In a reply to that/those tweet(s), I suggested it was all about a monopoly of oil, of fossile fuels.
In that " supposed strategy" the visit of Erdogan to Putin fits, as do Trumps

5881 2018-02-18 17:48:51 Feel better! Sending ((healing)) & there is an oil for that!
5882 2018-02-18 17:48:50 bread, granola, butter, honey, oil, cheese
5883 2018-02-18 17:48:43 He sent 2 warships into Cypriot territorial waters to threaten an Italian ship that had been commissioned by the Cypriot government to start exploratory drilling for oil/gas . 2 EU countries threatened by Erdogan, EU response......NOTHING 
5884 2018-02-18 17:48:35 I agree.  Let the Oil Sultans help rebuild and feed the Muslim nations.

5891 2018-02-18 17:47:09 Olga, I have a question/remark.
Earlier I read the replies on your tweets above, and saw oil/oligarch being mentioned.
It triggered me, even more than earlier today.

Earlier today, somebody tweeted on Netanyahu showing a peace of an Iranian drone. and tweeted the map Nethanyahu
5892 2018-02-18 17:47:03 But dont be negative yourself. Advise is like castor oil easy to give difficult to swallow. Practice before you preach is true and honest #leadsrship. Of course some really do
5893 2018-02-18 17:46:57 The oilers have good possession- but they’re not using it advantageously, and they’re not forcing the other team to take penalties because they’re not doing anything with the puck. Yes refs miss calls, and it seems especially so w/ Oil, but do you expect them to be perfect?
5894 2018-02-18 17:46:48 The old woman next door has just been round to ask me to stop drilling.

She's got a nerve. She's the first to complain about the price of oil.
5895 2018-02-18 17:46:29 Not to mention stopping or charging bc royalties on all the mat gas and oil coming from ne bc into Alberta via gasp pipelines . Why should Alberta continue to let bc use Alberta pipelines to sell nat gas. WHAT'S IN IT FOR US HORGAN
5896 2018-02-18 17:46:26 China is phasing out oil - so that doesn’t seem like a great long term plan since they just announced a new national bid to move towards electric
5897 2018-02-18 17:46:25 
5898 2018-02-18 17:46:25 I mean of somebody wants to shove my face into boiling oil... I wouldn't fight you 
5899 2018-02-18 17:46:24 Corruption rules in Mexico & cartels kill without limit yet this guy sits in judgement of us? Ludicrous!!
5900 2018-02-18 17:46:20 Only to extent that producers will sell oil to China at $40  (which is a matter of supply & demand for oil, not supply & demand for dollars). If producers hold  out & refuse to sell to China, then global oil inventory rises & China inventory (IMHO built for the purpose) falls
5901 2018-02-18 17:46:17 I completely agree that Miller could be great with a different coach, but if AV stays, there's no point in keeping Miller. Oil and water.
5902 2018-02-18 17:46:01 Just put some castor oil in my scalp and my scalp feels like heaven 
5903 2018-02-18 17:46:01 olive oil, sea salt... in the oven. Yum!!!
5904 2018-02-18 17:46:01 ผมก็ชอบครับ
5905 2018-02-18 17:45:52 He won a medal in Sochi. &Dozens of xgames medals. There's a reason why we hate to spend years of our life to perform for you assholes. Loads of good skiers & snowboarders doing tricks that would kill you skip Olympics cuz it's a commercialized joke for passive agressive viewers.
5906 2018-02-18 17:45:46 Its the mild mannered politicians who send our kids to fight wars the US oil companies started. Let their military contractors go there instead of my friends here in Canada. We have no place in a 17 year losing war. Theres 2 muslims in my town, thats not the issue.
5907 2018-02-18 17:45:25 trump is giving our country away, bit by bit. he is giving one of our most precious assets,our natl parks away to big oil and money grubbing cronies. we must save our parks for future generations, and prove to trump he will not win over resistance.

5911 2018-02-18 17:45:06 Took my car in for an oil change and turns out I have about $600 worth of repairs needed done that I had no idea about!! I am truly blessed 
5912 2018-02-18 17:45:02 Remember change the oil, fuel, transmission & air filters. They are important to preserve the engine #CarMaintenanceTips @DenRabzon pls #RT
5913 2018-02-18 17:44:58 Yes but how many may now how to? TO ANYONE READING THIS TWEET GET FETA IN A SMALL BAKING TRAY SPRAY SOME OLIVE OIL, OREGANO, A SLIXE OF TOMATO AND BELL PEPPER AND BAKE FOR 15 MINUTES AT 150°C. You're welcome
5914 2018-02-18 17:44:57 ya! long story short boiled shelled edamame in a food processor w garlic, olive oil, cracked pepper, salt, sesame oil, and black sesame if ur feeling #luxe
5915 2018-02-18 17:44:38 It was their money from before the revolution. The seeds of the revolution began when we overthrew (over oil) their democratically elected president in 1953, and installed a puppet regime. All this is common knowledge, but likely news to you.
5916 2018-02-18 17:44:31 Depends on how many of them have been promised an in on that $500B+ oil deposit sitting under the arctic ice Putin and Trump have their eyes on.
5917 2018-02-18 17:44:11 The person at the forefront fighting for America is #Mueller 
America is not some sh-thole banana/oil republic with Daddy Uday and Qusay raping and pillaging our Country and its Citizenry ...
We/America is better than this BS 
go #Mueller
5918 2018-02-18 17:44:04 If you don't like oil, stop buying it....take personal responsibility. You want to destroy 25% of Alberta's economy but keep driving, heating? What hypocricy. Check B.C. gov historic spill page - trucks, trains and barges are way more polluting,
5919 2018-02-18 17:43:59 That's why he was the first to win silver Olympic medal in Sochi, dozens of xgames medals, & dew tour championships & every other real contest. He had a bleeping broken hand. You wouldn't even tweet with a broken hand. Masturbate tho? Absolutely. To pics of him topless on Ellen.
5920 2018-02-18 17:43:57 Atauuu coba deh pakee minyak kelapaaa . Atau extract virgin oil. Diemin selama bobok trs bsknua keramas ttp pake conditioner yaaaaa kalo bisa hair mask. Jan lupa makarizo yg tube kecil apa tu lupa namanya
5921 2018-02-18 17:43:55 Fact they invited Rex Murphy before. Does this mean that they’re all cheerleaders for Oil&Gas now as well? Which is it? Teachers want to hear diverse opinions. What’s wrong with that? #ABleg
5922 2018-02-18 17:43:52 I got THC/CBD oil cartridges  my stock super low so hit a Niggah up

5926 2018-02-18 17:43:25 OMG the sauce actually tasted like it was meant too! Tho if I make it again less garlic and less oil cause it’s very prone to spitting sauce out of the pan at you at random & burning your hands! This is a miracle! I did way too much pasta tho and couldn’t eat it all! 
5927 2018-02-18 17:43:24 i need valve oil?
5928 2018-02-18 17:43:21 @minimalistbaker Just made pumpkin chocolate chip oat bread from your cookbook- (omitted the oil) this may be my favorite recipe yet!!
5929 2018-02-18 17:43:16 My hair feels so soft after doing a hot oil treatment last night 
5930 2018-02-18 17:43:08 Note to self: The orthopedic surgeon will never find it amusing when you ask what kind of essential oil to use when he tells you that you have a broken femur.
5931 2018-02-18 17:42:59 Lmao nah castor oil is my holy grail I cah live without it uh
5932 2018-02-18 17:42:37 Yes sir. 
Their oil money is only there for another max 15 years.
There after back to camels.
So investment in human resource is now a must which shud take about that much time knowing the hardened Wahabis will take a lot of time to reform?
5933 2018-02-18 17:42:36 Lol poor baby, I would put to much baby oil and etc on, go to school extra greasy

5936 2018-02-18 17:41:58 Cleantech, LNG, Oil&Gas tech are real opportunity engagement options for Indo-Canadian business. The level of debate needs to rise above the actions about one community.
5937 2018-02-18 17:41:55 okay did you go to the salon? at the end of the day it’s more about maintenance, moisturizing/oil and wrapping your hair. and the cold weather makes your hair brittle off too
5938 2018-02-18 17:41:55 Trust Putin and Russians,
Distrust FBI, DOJ, and Americans,
And then tell us that makes America Great.

Who buys that snake oil?
5939 2018-02-18 17:41:53 I'm sure Pence, being a good Christian would still be willing to meet and shake his hand. Even though his mouth was bigger than his performance
5940 2018-02-18 17:41:44 Sanctions.  Rosneft.  Oil & natural gas.  Money.  Follow the money
5941 2018-02-18 17:41:36 He medaled in Sochi.
5942 2018-02-18 17:41:31 I truly dislike when they try to massage my calves while I’m getting a pedi. I literally decline it every time. Lol 1. They put too much pressure. 2. I’m usually going home to shower, so what’s the point? 3. That oil/lotion at the end still leaves me ashy sooooo.... nah. Lol
5943 2018-02-18 17:41:24 OIL India's office is in the same building as mine. It stinks of colonial era, the way the officers behave.
They need a peon to accompany them holding their files even in an elevator.

5954 2018-02-18 17:40:17 @Xadeejournalist the volume of solid waste khi produces shouldn't it be used for making electricity?  Would be much cheaper comparing to coal and furnace oil ofcourse if it doesn't involve big cut which breeds pml-n or ppp

5964 2018-02-18 17:39:17 The hatred is not blind, nor even hatred.   Ive read your books, and much like the Bible and the quaran see far too many inconsistencies to label it anything but snake oil
5965 2018-02-18 17:39:15 Absolutely. Many countries synthesised a vast array of valuable products from coal. It's like a crystalline form of Crude Oil.  #RSA were experts at it. 
5966 2018-02-18 17:38:48 Could be, or maybe something to do with the likelihood that people will use vegetable oil of some sort rather than duck fat/lard/dripping.
5967 2018-02-18 17:38:46 They’re smart enough to know that silly-assed purity politics are total bullshit. 

Tell me, oh wise one: When you heard of Jill’s oil investments or saw her fur-swaddled ass photographed in Russia, did you think that was her being “green”?
5968 2018-02-18 17:38:30 @AmberRuddHR good afternoon please intervene in the little boy who needs cannabis oil, his quality of life will vastly improve and he has a chance of not been permanently living in an institution, I ask you only to look at the facts.

I thought they seemed unusually oily. They were my landlady's idea. I didn't want her to make my lunches. She insisted. I left not long after.

I'm talking about oil weath then being stopped being creamed off by small ruling elites for good of people. You need to know dates when Corbyn visited. Don't fall for spin, read back issues of Economist.
6036 2018-02-18 17:29:33 No I am saying whether it #UCP (ABPC) or #NDP all they are interested in doing is selling our natural resources at a huge discount. Whether timber, oil, agricultural goods. Been doing it for decades actually forever.

6043 2018-02-18 17:28:56 I have an antidote. 1. Place chevre on a serving plate 2. make a warm olive oil vinaigrette with capers, shallots, lovage, parsley, thyme and oregano.  Spoon over chevre, place rest in a bowl 3. Serve with bread.

6045 2018-02-18 17:28:07 Yes, Russia and Iran have made strategic gains but w US holding most of Syria's oil & good agricultural land, it isn't clear how useful those gains will really be. Russia has to be included in all regional talks, but RU & Iran will have to spend gobs of money to stabilize Syria.
6046 2018-02-18 17:27:57 It needs to be legalised for medicinal purposes. Closest stuff I have tried for my conditions is CBD oil, not the stuff from Holland and Barrett’s though as it’s too weak. This stuff is safer than taking things like TRAMADOL which is a dangerous and addictive drug.
6047 2018-02-18 17:27:56 As a gay individual, I find this completely condescending, I want to be judged based on my performance, not by an aspect of my being I have no control of. But understand the liberal thirst for identity politics.

6091 2018-02-18 17:21:32 I'm not sure what's not true?

6111 2018-02-18 17:18:44 I lot of people mentioned coconut oil but it’s too big to absorbed by your skin. Instead jojoba oil, and vitamin e and c. But only at night for the last too. Tea tree when breakouts are. Coming. Also exfoliating and drinking water!!
6112 2018-02-18 17:18:40 I recently learned that eucalyptus oil in a steam diffuser can be lethal to cats. So scary if you’re ill and want your cat to sleep nearby!

6133 2018-02-18 17:16:25 I wish people would know the truth about Venezuela. Charvez before the oil crash spent the revenue in providing healthcare, education & clean water for the majority excluded poor. I'm not saying everything was perfect but understand smear, coup & US destablishation attempts.

6135 2018-02-18 17:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet they go out fast.

6137 2018-02-18 17:15:49 I get free car washes when I get my oil changed, and if the car wash wasn't LITERALLY NEXT TO the mechanic shop, I probably wouldn't go

6139 2018-02-18 17:15:35 @nativekittens HOT oil and a flare gun. That’ll make it hot for them! 
6140 2018-02-18 17:15:33 .@deejayndn Ian Campeau makes the very critical point that support for Kinder Morgan and decolonization aren’t reconcilable at the #NDP #Ottawa2018 convention. 

The NDP needs to be clear on this issue, not pander to politicians bought by big oil.

6143 2018-02-18 17:14:38 Escucho la radio y hay una publicidad que dice "rapid oil change", porque el concepto de cambiar el aceite del en poco tiempo es tan novedoso que no hay un equivalente castellano para ese neologismo inglés.

6145 2018-02-18 17:14:20 Coconut oil,  baking soda and peppermint essential oil(20 -50 drops). I use a 4 oz jar.  Mix it up till you get the desired consistency. You can also use stevia for sweeter but the peppermint oil is good enough for me.

6151 2018-02-18 17:13:33 I have a 11 yr old doxy and he has a few fatty bumps common to that breed. He also had bad breath too so I gave him cbd oil to ingest and his breath is so much better now.  I still give him the oil now because why not use it to prevent anything else?
6152 2018-02-18 17:13:29 Crown Oil Arena doesn't quite have the same ring to it...
6153 2018-02-18 17:13:28 Yes Dr. I've included olive oil as part of my diet and I've heard about the benefits of omega-rich fish especially salmon...however, I must admit that I love a good steak and meat for that matter, but I try to cut back a little.  Good article Dr.
6154 2018-02-18 17:13:20 You won’t go back to oil Russ once you’ve got familiar with water based. 5 years in for me now. Never use oil not even on exteriors now.
6155 2018-02-18 17:13:09 When oil trades are agreed price is denominated in $/€/£/Yuan etc at whatever is the ruling spot/forward FX rates based on (capital/trade) value flows at that time. Oil is a fraction of those flows. eg 2/3 of US $ supply is based on capitalised US land use value via mortgages

6170 2018-02-18 17:11:58 Price correlates w/inventories vs theoretical production capacity. The larger variable is OPEC success in controlling WW stocks over time. OPEC is better off as a whole selling less at higher prices. E&P investment will be moderated by risk posed by perceived surplus capacity.

6179 2018-02-18 17:11:26 My wife's cousin worked on oil rigs for a while. Went back to school and got a master's degree. Some family members were mad that he used that to stop going on the rigs and to work in an office on the mainland. Felt like he was cheating.

6213 2018-02-18 17:06:51 The palm oil industry is based on the same kind of exploitation of local peoples, wildlife and resources as any other. Your response is naïve and ill informed. I wonder How much you really know about the lives of sustainable palm oil communities.
6214 2018-02-18 17:06:44 No one is angry over here madam, if anything you sound upset. I shared an article that I thought was insightful. There are facts in the article. Oil prices fell and if the deal went through, that project would have been operating at a huge loss talk less of the abandex clause
6215 2018-02-18 17:06:07 We also give a lot to Turkey which has been spending that investment on the Kurds and probably selling oil to ISIS. And Trump wants to move oversight on small arms sales from the State Dept to the Commerce Dept... And HE's the American president who stopped arming terrorists?

6229 2018-02-18 17:04:47 It seriously does need to be licensed for medicinal use. I have tried CBD oil for my conditions. It touched the pain more than medicine like Tramadol did, and it’s much less dangerous and non addictive. A lot of the stuff we get fished out can be more dangerous 
6230 2018-02-18 17:04:42 It's just that Dolly crops up several times in HHH, though never seen, and is also referred to in Steptoe and Son. Oil Drum Lane also features in both programmes.
6231 2018-02-18 17:04:37 Only the government should be allowed to have guns because government protect innocent minorities from getting killed by racists.

6237 2018-02-18 17:04:13 In case you aren't aware... the tanker traffic is to ship fuel and oil FROM Burnaby not deliver it here. The expanded capacity in the proposed pipeline is not for local consumption. It is for export. The refinery shuts down every year for maintenance as does every refinery.

6252 2018-02-18 17:02:59 No you don’t get it. The money was oil money that we were holding.  It was unable to be paid any other way because of the sanctions. Christ people don’t you think if the president was doing something illegal he would hide it from the world instead of doing it out in the open.

6256 2018-02-18 17:02:23 Thank you! I have been trying to avoid buying anything with palm oil for that reason.  It's nice to know that you don't contribute to that,and where you get it from.

6288 2018-02-18 16:58:43 We recognise the importance of the role of the palm oil industry to the economy in developing countries. Transforming the market to a sustainable & traceable supply is, we feel, the most responsible path. 1/2

Winter - cheeks are too dry.
Summer - cheeks are too oily.
6305 2018-02-18 16:56:46 They do often go to work only wearing briefs and boots, oil their bodies, wet their hair. There’s a lot of similarities.

6309 2018-02-18 16:56:02 What is the difference between BC wine and AB tarsands?  BC wine is renewable, can be organic or biodynamic, the end products of winemaking can fertilize the soil or be used for feed. Oil sands are not renewable, not organic, can't eat the end products. #bcwine #bcpoli #abpoli
6310 2018-02-18 16:55:32 I've started taking fish oil capsules...in 6 days I noticed the difference...and I had chronic dry skin all my adult life.
6311 2018-02-18 16:55:29 So what do you think happens to the demand for dollars if the oil price drops from $65/barrel to (say) $40/bbl when China pulls the plug on the US dominated ICE Brent oil market? #OOTT Oil is not priced in dollars: dollars (and gold) are priced in oil
6312 2018-02-18 16:55:22 Let’s not forget what you ,Steve Bannon ,Miller,Kelly and a few others want to destroy America and create a new white supremacist nation and keep the Uber Rich in charge and to pay back Russia for bailing you out just a con man, snake oil salesman, carnival barker #Anonymous
6313 2018-02-18 16:55:17 The coconut oil deep conditioner is amazing and it has almond milk 
6314 2018-02-18 16:55:16 I watched a YouTuber who suggested using loose mineral powder or pressed powder and then some sort of face mist. :) tapos the experience daw is it "melts" the powder to stay on the face and because it's not liquid foundation, it does well against oil build up throughout the day.
6315 2018-02-18 16:55:13 Oh, you used a oil based paint for that room?

6318 2018-02-18 16:54:29 Boycott all major companies like kellogs nestle unilever that fill our foods with palm oil. It's unhealthy and destroys the environment. Contact supermarkets like Aldo, Waitrose, M n S that will listen. You are paying to harm yourself.
6319 2018-02-18 16:54:28 The scenes at The Crown Oil Arena. Ian Henderson puts Rochdale 1-0 up. Nobody can say it's undeserved.

6320 2018-02-18 16:54:16 Are you being purposely thick-skulled?
Vehicles are necessary for life in Canada.
Which is better, using Canadian oil & bitumen where we can control environmental impact.  Or shipping crude halfway around the world(that doesn't take diesel or anything)?

6325 2018-02-18 16:53:55 Idk how people use coconut oil. That does not work for me at all.
6326 2018-02-18 16:53:44 Fb has had a history of allowing complete scams, snake oil products and corrupt investments advertise on fb. Yet now they block all crypto from advertising on fb and now harass individuals that are part of the crypto world. They are part of a huge campaign to hinder crypto
6327 2018-02-18 16:53:43 Perhaps it should be reported, although I’m not sure who to. I have seen warnings here about palm oil washing up along the south coast as dog owners are warned to make sure no dogs nibble the lumps.
6328 2018-02-18 16:53:41 The “spill issue” is leftist drivel. Pipeline is by far the safest method of moving oil. Far safer than road or rail. Most Canadians want the country to do well economically. Oil is a big piece of that. Sit in your left wing bubble, but you’re as wrong as can be.
6329 2018-02-18 16:53:31 そりゃそうか...w
まーでも夜更かしせん程度にね
6330 2018-02-18 16:53:28 من بظبط ....؟
6331 2018-02-18 16:53:06 The question is: how much oil to move by pipeline?  

Once Canada decides how much oil to move, then it can approve a decent transport system.

Right now, the debate is being driven by a greed induced all-you-can-get-at-the-trough attitude coming from Alberta.

Ketogenic diet stopped all day time seizures now for the past 13 years. Cannabis oil has almost stopped night seizures after 3 months. True story

6343 2018-02-18 16:51:17 Changing my birth control to one for acne was the biggest help! Micellar water at night, a scrub in the morning if needed, and oil control moisturizer. Also just trying to leave my skin TF alone (less makeup/face touching)!
6344 2018-02-18 16:51:07 it means nothing $70M in lost revenue compared to the $billions lost in the #cdnpoli economy as well as thousands of good paying jobs. Cut off oil shipments to #bcpoli. They don't need fuel, they all ride bikes & eat bugs living off the grid #ableg

6352 2018-02-18 16:50:40 I appreciate the discourse and additional data. I’ll take the under on $65 WTI in one year’s time and no opinion on price 4-5 years out.
6353 2018-02-18 16:50:36 They will only ever change if there is a boycotting campaign of all their products. We are paying them to destroy our environment. If we stop feeding them money, they will stop and listen. I've noticed Aldi has less palm oil products.
6354 2018-02-18 16:50:33 Great news! Now mankind can set up giant photosynthesis machines around the , turning CO2 from burning fossil fuels into oxygen. Full speed ahead for the oil business! But then McKenna, Suzuki, Klein, Gore et al will be bitching about too much oxygen in the air. #cdnpoli

6379 2018-02-18 16:47:40 Higher oil prices are good for manufacturing, bad for service wage workers that need to drive to work. The impact of disposable income really comes from those who drive the longest to work 60-90 minute commute people. Higher cost for companies for sure.

6409 2018-02-18 16:44:57 Do you think the higher oil prices have less of an effect on the economy due to increase of alternative fuels?
6410 2018-02-18 16:44:36 Definite yes. Add a drizzle of truffle infused olive oil and go heavy on the mozzarella 
6411 2018-02-18 16:44:21 Um so the @PandaExpress in north hollywood doesn't use any gloves or anything while handling their food which I think is disgusting. Id see them HANDLING CASH and then using their bare hands to touch food to throw something on the grill or in oil. That's absolutely ridiculous
6412 2018-02-18 16:44:16 I did a full body honey, lemon, olive oil, & brown sugar scrub this morning and I feel AMAZINGGG
6413 2018-02-18 16:44:15 Preciso comprar um hidratante facial oil free pq nessa vida de sabonete de enxofre, argila verde e filtro solar oil free, minha pele vai ficando mega seca e não pode
6414 2018-02-18 16:44:09 Oh ok  never tried coconut oil I use brown sugar lemon juice and honey
6415 2018-02-18 16:44:06 Depends on the contract. But dropping oil prices would be huge
6416 2018-02-18 16:44:02 So disappointed @FiveGuysUK don’t do fries that aren’t cooked in peanut oil.  can’t share how amazing it is with Jack
6417 2018-02-18 16:43:58 1) Pringles have basically no oil.
2) I can always rinse the container before use.
6418 2018-02-18 16:43:49 Its a joke and a lie. Palm oil is bad for us and the envirnment
6419 2018-02-18 16:43:42 Dollar is just paper i don t know why is it so precious? Why arabs don't use their money selling oil? These are not queations these are reasons of idiot economic system of the world.
6420 2018-02-18 16:43:37 Sluice on some castor oil and some cheap siliconey conditioner and you’re good to go. I was platinum after ??? 2 weeks
6421 2018-02-18 16:43:18 Yeah I now use the argan oil perfect edges thing
6422 2018-02-18 16:43:16 As a current member of the ATA and a member of a multi-generational oil family I don’t even like David Suzuki. Oh and I also have a husband who is a forestry technician. And I didn’t vote NDP. Just saying.

6424 2018-02-18 16:42:58 codfish and potatoes would be lovely right now  red sauce, butter sauce, onions, small banana and some buttered bread  drizzle some olive oil on top, pepper and mayo.

6428 2018-02-18 16:42:47 Day after day hes speaking just like bush when he wanted to invade Irak for oil. But now everyday knows the trick and its hard 2 convince

6439 2018-02-18 16:41:10 Oil in the lea canal - its been reported but still there.
6440 2018-02-18 16:41:04 Сегодня узнал, что проезд на маршрутке от метро до работы стоит 20р, а я всегда платил 40
6441 2018-02-18 16:41:02 Just make sure the oil is hot enough and you’ll do fine.
6442 2018-02-18 16:40:59 It could be any sort of oil/fat or resin derivative used in the cosmetic industry, hopefully not toxic - although palm oil is poisonous in pure form and people eat it in everything

6444 2018-02-18 16:40:42 For those of you that will be bowling in the U.S. Open Direct Qualifier Tournament the oil pattern to be used is the 2017 U.S. Open Pattern.
6445 2018-02-18 16:40:38 Everybody should check ingredients in foods and not consume anything with palm oil. It is unhealthy and also destroys the rain forests. This would companies like Unilever to care about peoples health and the wlefare of the planet.
6446 2018-02-18 16:40:36 What castor oil did you use?

6452 2018-02-18 16:39:57 an old man called me worthless the other day because our oil is too expensive. because i control our oil prices apparently
6453 2018-02-18 16:39:49 The coconut oil and the castor oil ones are what I use
6454 2018-02-18 16:39:49 ออยยยยย
6455 2018-02-18 16:39:31 i use oil before cuz mine sinks in like a serum and i want the best ingredients first and creams for me are what i use as barriers rather than something that sinks in if that makes sense

6457 2018-02-18 16:39:21 Ban all palm oil in foods. It is unhealthy and also damages wildlife.
6458 2018-02-18 16:39:06 You have to factor in, that the 2010 to 2014 time frame was limited by global recession, as the result of the financial crisis in 2008 and high oil prices. While the NDA actually had a perfect playing field for growth, with the global economy recovered and low oil prices.
6459 2018-02-18 16:39:02 พินูช่วงนี้สดใสมากกกก ไปกินอะไรมาไม่รู้5555555
6460 2018-02-18 16:39:00 if you use the green Eco gel its gonna let it look flaky. Try the coconut oil one or the castor oil one

6462 2018-02-18 16:38:51 Bread with tomatoes, garlic, salt and olive oil
6463 2018-02-18 16:38:48 I think you are totally misguided. Why not ban palm oil completely? And use healthy oils instead. Sustainable palm oil could well be just a name and not a deed. Who are doing the checks? companies like Unilever? Better to boycott all products with palm oil
6464 2018-02-18 16:38:46 day 1 of coconut oil pulling, and I’m realizing how out of shape of my cheeks are #realtalk
6465 2018-02-18 16:38:41 Here’s the thing- @pixarcars 2 gets LOTS of hate. After rewatching all 3 movies last night, 2 had a seriously intricate but fascinating plot. Axel Rod was capitalizing on gasoline by creating a fake brand of alternative oil that was purposely harmful, which led cars back to gas.

6468 2018-02-18 16:38:23 Have you guys stolen the oil lol? :-)
6469 2018-02-18 16:38:20 Bloomberg in Energy Voice says

Pretty much ignored by Unionist controlled Scottish media.

Ergo, it's time to halt purchases of CDs, DVDs, iPods, laptops, iPhones and other goods derived from petrochemicals. Also, no more flat screen TVs. Have a nice day.
6472 2018-02-18 16:38:02 All they have is Oil&Gas and minerals. Plus hackers who try to steal other people’s money and information. Oh and nukes.

6473 2018-02-18 16:37:57 Yep. Thatz no discussion about food bro 'til you know when to use butter or olive oil.  You miss food fundamental bro.
6474 2018-02-18 16:37:39 How does it feel to do the dirty of Big Oil, who are destroying your children's future? I'm amazed at what dirty money will buy but should not be surprised by another front group for a dying industry. Last gasps eh? #DivestNY

6482 2018-02-18 16:37:07 Palm oil is extremely unhealthy. It should not be promoted at all.

6490 2018-02-18 16:36:16 Palm oil is extremely unhealthy. You know that. Why do you use unhealthy fats and oils in your foods? Your products should be boycotted and banned. Also how does anyone know how much damage is done by your suppliers. What is the tracking criteria?

6515 2018-02-18 16:34:00 Yes but how does anyone know how this is administered? they may claim its sustainable when its not. Also Palm oil is a huge health hazard. Its better it is banned in all food products and replaced with healthy oils like rapeseed oil.

6520 2018-02-18 16:33:36 This looks fake. With that sort of oil content the chip has to appear drenched and not dry as seen in the clip. If you rub any banana chip between your fingers you would see some oil residue but this chip probably had a tea spoon of oil there.

6555 2018-02-18 16:29:27 I know they’re grieving but they’re asking the wrong thing. They should demand armed security guards and allowing teachers to concealed carry. Take down the gun free zone signs and put up signs saying under armed security.
6556 2018-02-18 16:29:25 It was already here. It looks like an oil painting on canvas where they tried to mimic a cardboard look & feel.
6557 2018-02-18 16:28:45 Reagan won because:

1) He convinced Iran to keep the Embassy hostages until after the election.
2) The rise of oil prices from the first major flexing of muscles by OPEC, the resulting rise in gasoline prices and the gas lines across the US.

6561 2018-02-18 16:27:50 Can't see the quoted tweet but "Hot money" is currency that moves regularly, and quickly, between financial markets, follows where it can get the best short term rate.

Oil money is revenue from selling oil

6565 2018-02-18 16:27:25 I use ‘King of Shaves’ oil. It comes in a teensy bottle & you use the tiniest of amounts. Available everywhere.
6566 2018-02-18 16:27:20 What a great tree. You can use the oil for biodiesel!
6567 2018-02-18 16:27:19 Why are Rochdale trying to play 'good' Football? Have they got 'Oil Money'?
6568 2018-02-18 16:27:01 Pineapple juice or crushed pineapple, Worcester, brown sugar, olive oil, garlic, and some chopped chillis (if you want some heat)
6569 2018-02-18 16:26:59 I bought serum, scrub, supplement, oil serum, cleanser, mask and all the things can make my scar go away. So lets do it. Please dont make me sad okay?
6570 2018-02-18 16:26:56 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
6571 2018-02-18 16:26:50 It's Canadian oil. They only extract it.

We don't have diamonds. 
We don't have money. 
We don't have big land.
6575 2018-02-18 16:26:10 I really like eucalyptus or peppermint oil.

6577 2018-02-18 16:25:53 Now quantify how much of that capex decline is due to actual reduction in activity vs service cost deflation...You will come up with a different conclusion  #OOTT
6578 2018-02-18 16:25:41 If I have to spend five minutes forcefully stirring in the oil, it’s not peanut butter, it’s a travesty.
6579 2018-02-18 16:25:38 Kalau kulit tak ngam dgn mineral oil can cause clogged pores so better pakai yg takde mineral oil :)
6580 2018-02-18 16:25:27 Yes, all ingredients room temp.
I don`t know if that works with bacon grease though. Never tried it.
I would rather try that for Sauce Hollandaise.
If you use olive oil take a mild one, or the mayonnaise tastes bitter.
6581 2018-02-18 16:25:21 It’s 2018, we only drinking olive oil

6584 2018-02-18 16:24:49 We’d be down the pan if we’d voted yes & fine you know it. The oil price crash would’ve absolutely seen to that. The truth is you should be very grateful to NO voters for saving the day however I won’t hold my breath.
6585 2018-02-18 16:24:45 Good morning Lillia, Sorry, I was putting a gallon of oil in my truck. I'm just going to the same place twice. Once today and another run to the same place tomorrow. I just call it a double run.
6586 2018-02-18 16:24:36 Yeah I stopped taking fish oil cause of that, I don't eat fish I sure as hell don't wanna burp it up  I'll try the lemon kind. Dang girl thank you so much! I feel like something is lacking and that's probably it
6587 2018-02-18 16:24:33 Awesome! With Adobe you can get the same effect. For the whole piece I use a brush that mimics Oil paint (With a bristle texture)
6588 2018-02-18 16:24:27 Indira nationalized banks and rougue oil companies who refused to giv indian army oil during 1971 war...she did the right thing fr nation...@narendramodi is more intrested in privatising indian assets...such a pity hez selling @airindiain

6592 2018-02-18 16:23:54 Water will be fought over soon. In OK, oil companies are buying farmland and sinking water wells into the ground to extract everything in the aquifer for production and sale to other oil companies. Thousands of years maybe never to recover.

6594 2018-02-18 16:23:43 @IDFreshFood Your much hyped vada batter is a big letdown.Although tasty,it is too cumbersome ,soaks lots of oil and nozzle needs to be cleaned  regularly wasting lots of batter.Definitely will not buy again unless you correct these.Not really worth it!!
6595 2018-02-18 16:23:39 Not only are they still in Vancouver, they are still buying land, buying oil patches in Alberta, scamming. BC's gov't is powerless.

6605 2018-02-18 16:22:08 And these wars are fought for more than resource' s like oil,, it's abt who controls money...central banks...this is how u control a country regardless of who the president or dictator or who ever that is running the show....control a Nations money supply,,control it's politics
6606 2018-02-18 16:21:57 Need an oil change I be so lazy doe
6607 2018-02-18 16:21:51 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
6608 2018-02-18 16:21:40 This may come as a surprise to you, but that actor, Sam Elliot, hates Trump and said: "I thought about voting republican once. Then decided to buy book of Mormon, dump oil in a national park, and give all my money to a billionaire. Figured I’d cut out the middle man”.

6612 2018-02-18 16:21:09 And a very good oil massage!
6613 2018-02-18 16:20:50 apparently hemp oil and electric blanket helps to calm the nerves
6614 2018-02-18 16:20:40 sorry this is so late but I usually take an excedrine extra strength 500mg and drink a soda (for the caffeine) and then go to sleep. sometimes putting lavender essential oil on the back of your neck + forehead helps. I often put an ice pack on the back of my neck too
6615 2018-02-18 16:20:32 The Special Offers area of Tescos is cordoned off to only allow a couple of people in at a time and is guarded by two staff. Welcome to the 21st century. It's like Mad Max only fighting over expiry date éclairs instead of oil.

6620 2018-02-18 16:20:04 Make sure you blend it with water first so it won’t lump up in your hair! 

Also, leave-in conditioner on your hair while it’s still wet after you get out the shower, and seal it with oil afterwards. I hope it works.

6625 2018-02-18 16:18:56 Looks interesting, I did something similar this year, but with the BP Oil Spill in the Gulf. I think yours in more current though - may have to keep it in mind for after the AP exam.
6626 2018-02-18 16:18:49 Trump put a tariff on solar panels so the price of that oil should go sky high

6628 2018-02-18 16:18:37 I will! I have been using stuff with argan oil in it which has been good but as my hair is quite dry and brittle I'll give this a go  Despite this and my colitis I'm not letting it get the better of me! #HairLossHappens

6633 2018-02-18 16:16:57 Same. I blurt out the price and that I got it at a sample sale. When it comes to nails, I take hair skin & nails supplements and rub coconut oil or Shea butter on my cuticles.

6635 2018-02-18 16:16:55 Ok, Einstein. What do you think would happen to the oil market price if China cut ICE/Brent purchases & switched liquidity to Shanghai ? Exactly what happened to LIFFE bund futures when a major market-maker switched liquidity to Deutsche Borse.

6665 2018-02-18 16:12:48 Anointing oil is natural
6666 2018-02-18 16:12:43 Are you okay?
6667 2018-02-18 16:12:39 Indeed. Equally, Jesus rebuked Judas for saying girl with the alabaster jar should sell her oil & give the proceeds to the poor instead of using it on Christ. The Faith has never insisted that everyone must be a pauper. Ever. It has warned about dangers of wealth. Not same thing

6682 2018-02-18 16:11:03 All that electricity has to come from somewhere and sure as shit oil company’s would still have there foot in the door. But they defiantly wouldn’t be making half as much as they do now. So idk if it would be good for them, but they’d survive.
6683 2018-02-18 16:10:38 Oil Prices  a lot of investors/firms are long but over time, ups and downs we expect Oil to Retest its lows & break through its lows. this will be drawn out over time but a Retest of th elows and Failure will happen. That will be the time to buy both Oil and Natural Gas.

6693 2018-02-18 16:08:55 Or don’t we know that Agric imports accounted for well over 60% of our ‘recorded’ imports; with rice, palm oil & fish taking a significant proportion of that percentage?

Wasn’t it their ban that made their coats skyrocket almost instantaneously?
6694 2018-02-18 16:08:55 The UK home office have just refused to let a 6 yr old boy with severe epilepsy take cannabis oil. It reduced his fits from 4,000/yr to 20, and they still refused him a medical license. Because the UK Govt, is a uncaring as the US Govt about its own people.

6733 2018-02-16 23:56:15 It is bizarre to see Canada's Prime Minister Trudeau pushing for crude oil pipelines to meet Paris Accord efforts to cut emissions from fossil  fuels. This is the most Orwellian plan we have seen. Developing  renewable energy is the best way to #KeepCanadaWorking #BCWines #stopkm
6734 2018-02-16 23:56:12 It was a rumor at first, the victim later confirmed in an interview that it wasn't actually shit but a mix of self-tanner and baby oil. Though I do stand by my theory that Orton uses so much of both he may actually shit them.
6735 2018-02-16 23:56:07 Hahaha. Delete your account. You are big oil and not fooling anyone.

6741 2018-02-16 23:54:57 The only difference is that Canada and Norway aren't enemies of the US (and don't have oil). Their democratic process is more transparent as well, and more benefits for citizens but I'd assume that's because they're allowed to prosper hence they have more funds.
6742 2018-02-16 23:54:56 What the hell are they serving then? Oil?
6743 2018-02-16 23:54:56 Just dropped a full, Costco sized container of coconut oil on my two little toes - instantly black and blue. That pain took my breath away.
6744 2018-02-16 23:54:34 We are in a tough spot on this coast those with the oil do not have to see or deal with negative effects of any oil issue...spill it ,drip it ,we do need dirty Alberta oil and I grew up in Calgary  For 30 yrs I have lived on beautiful Vancouver Island, no regrets

6748 2018-02-16 23:54:05 Yes! I used to babysit for the 4th gen of a wealthy fam, but the mother (3rd gen) didn't work, spent like crazy, & dad/her family oil holdings paid for everything incl her $1.4mil house. Grandma (2nd gen) did her best w/the kids bc of the daughter, but all were miz
6749 2018-02-16 23:54:03 I was thinking the same thing. Also, all these Dem fucks mad about minimal spending from "Russian sources" have no problem with big pharma, banks, and oil pouring tons of cash DIRECTLY TO POLITICIANS AND THEIR CAMPAIGNS! I'll take YouTube videos with 300 views over that any day.

6752 2018-02-16 23:52:21 Was a good day so far. Shopping run. Oil change. There is minimal snow only 30 miles south of us and it was kind of weird. This is three winters where I have not had to snow blow the drive way.
6753 2018-02-16 23:52:10 In 2011 a western ND Bakken rig could bring in a well in 60 days for $12,000,000 Today that same rig does it in 30 days for $6,000,000 so 1 rig today does what 2 did 6 years ago.  Rig count up today means 2x the oil of 6 years ago
6754 2018-02-16 23:51:52 Which oil-producing country would have been better off (the most) without oil under its soil:
6755 2018-02-16 23:51:30 In a static world it would be...but the world isn't static.  I think offshore oil will be important for many years ahead but it just s difficult to be certain, and difficult to know how important in tax take terms..with decommissioning, volatility etc.
6756 2018-02-16 23:51:08 And use vitamin E oil
6757 2018-02-16 23:51:06 So I'm getting my oil changed and they noticed I had the wrong battery in my car (thx AutoZone) and they changed it and now my car isn't starting and they're like "wait what" I'm dead lmao
6758 2018-02-16 23:50:53 Pro tip: Maybe don’t leave your lube next to your hair oil. Maybe especially before you go to get a hair cut.

6767 2018-02-16 23:49:29 State of Emergency: I’m out of olive oil.
6768 2018-02-16 23:49:29 I just remember back when oil reserves were estimated at 500 years...and now wonder what happened to those extra 400 years.
6769 2018-02-16 23:49:28 Walking home after dropping off my car for an oil change gave me the perfect opportunity to dance to #MonstaX all the way home. Not sure what the drivers thought passing me, but I hope they liked it.

6778 2018-02-16 23:48:17 So is Alberta saying that oil is a national resource? If so, sign over the profits and royalties to the feds. If not, stop trying to force your toxic sludge through our coast.

6796 2018-02-16 23:44:33 See you are wanting to pillage out environment and will take 0 accountability of it. This is the responsibility of Canada to protect out environment and ecosystems - and we should all be protesting a pipeline and oil which will not serve any Canadians. #Propaganda
6797 2018-02-16 23:44:12 Los veedores de OIL: “Tanto la oferta como el plan estratégico no cuentan con requisitos indispensables para ser considerados para resolver los desequilibrios económicos de las empresas del Grupo y al mismo tiempo mantener la capacidad de proteger los intereses de los acreedores"
6798 2018-02-16 23:44:05 I mean, a really incisive person might wonder if the oil drilling interests and the alt right wing propagandists who foment the Parkland incident weren't in fact very closely aligned, and perhaps even mutually funded? (cough, #Breitbart #Mercer #CNP #ALEC #KochBros, cough)
6799 2018-02-16 23:43:58 Sen. Ojeda says there is talk West Virginia could be the next Saudi Arabia (from oil) so there is no reason West Virginians should live in poverty.
6800 2018-02-16 23:43:35 They burn down acres of forest to grow this shit. While burning they're killing the local people with the smoke as well as destroying the wildlife and ecosystems. On top of that Palm oil isn't even good for any of us.

6802 2018-02-16 23:43:07 The Liberals ran to the left of the NDP in the last election & moved from 3rd to 1st. The NDP tried to run as a more centrist party & lost big time. Trudeau is quite smart to move the Libs well into the left because he's choking off the NDP, except in BC where they're pushing Oil
6803 2018-02-16 23:43:04 #notley must be craving a better wine  @CBCNews Let’s think #environment first , keep our oil in Canada 
6804 2018-02-16 23:42:39 Absolutely not this is pure propaganda - how about you inform all of Canadians where this oil is going and who the pipeline serves. 0% of the oil will be used to serve Canadian demand and it is all being shipped over seas and to Asia... so who benefits?
6805 2018-02-16 23:42:29 I’m not really sure you understand what the NRA does. We the people, legal gun owners pay them dues to lobby on our behalf. It’s kind of like AARP. Political money from the NRA is a drop in the bucket to what the unions, pharma, media, oil & the food industry pay.
6806 2018-02-16 23:42:26 I’m NO fan of lil’ donnie but how can you single him out? He’s a puppet. Chuckle Schumer is not opposed to sucking the tit of oil companies. Obama also complicit.
6807 2018-02-16 23:42:25 I wasn’t allowed to attend (i.e. was turned away at the door) Interspill (an oil spill conference) 3 years ago in Amsterdam because I had my eight-year-old with me. I cried.

6810 2018-02-16 23:41:59 Not to split hairs, but one of the scientifically-recognized threats to the orcas is contaminants, whether in their food source or in the ambient marine environment. Those contaminants would include instantaneous, point source oil spills.
6811 2018-02-16 23:41:48 Lets remember that those "alienated Hillary voters" were created by a smear campaign by Trump, Stein and Bernie Douchbag Sanders who were ALL colluding with Russia. All Dems should distance themselves from Bernie and his snake oil.

6838 2018-02-16 23:37:28 My problem with the whole CCS for EOR concept is I am anticipating we won’t be needing to recover oil for that much longer (30 years max) so what happens then?
6839 2018-02-16 23:37:20 Friendly reminder: NRA, WS, Big Pharma, oil & gas, insurers, gerrymandering, racist voter suppression, other wholly US/“legal” election-rigging groups/schemes 100% alter outcomes, kill ppl, poison water/air, rip off consumers/ordinary citizens. #Russiagate benign in comparison.

6844 2018-02-16 23:36:19 I just heard from a non-news source that a Chinese ship, off their coast near Korea, spilled a massive amount of oil into the ocean — worst oil spill ever.  Did anyone hear about this?

6884 2018-02-16 23:27:56 lol you know what Trump has done for Russia since he's gotten power? Kept troops on Russia's border, keep economic sanctions, constantly bomb their top ally in Syria, killed the Exxon-Russia oil deal, and sold weapons to anti-Russian Ukraine.
6885 2018-02-16 23:27:49 And sorry the NRA is not a corproation in business for profit. It’s goal is to protect its members right. Not make money.  Using a gun the way it is intended does not harm anyone like tobacco, nor does it hurt the environment like oil. Try again

Cars don't "require" any of those things to be driven, lawfully or unlawfully.  The only thing a car requires is gas and oil, or charged batteries. No wonder this country is a mess.

6981 2018-02-16 23:11:39 Do explain how Venezuela is similar to Britain? - Its main export was oil, is Britain's? Oil prices slumped, severely damaging the economy, could that happen in Britain. Yes there was mismanagement, - but then there is political mismanagement here too.
6982 2018-02-16 23:11:25 So this week suspension goes on jeep, dishwasher breaks and run out of oil. Things happen in 3's eh!!! Excellent week.
6983 2018-02-16 23:11:18 On my days off, its time to catch up in grown up things. Fixing my cooling control circut on my Magnum, Taking the Rav for an oil change and obtaining my San Diego county Library card.
6984 2018-02-16 23:11:18 lets call them #TSK ... No need putting more oil into that fire.
#TFSA you can call whatever you want 
6985 2018-02-16 23:11:16 So fucking sick of fidget spinners  if we're spending $ over there might as well take their oil
6986 2018-02-16 23:10:54 Hey TB when my mom went through chemo she would put olive oil on her mouth sores and it provided a lot of relief
6987 2018-02-16 23:10:30 Mmmm.  With countries beginning to commit to electric cars, not oil, and the campaign to be plastic free, oil producing countries will have to quadriple efforts to diversify.  it's a challenge and an opportunity.

6989 2018-02-16 23:09:55 So you're on the opposite end of Port Arthur Texas. I am originally from Philly. Pennsylvania is where the first oil well was drilled and found. Pennsylvania Oil was always considered, at one time, the best machine oil.  I've used it in my cars for the past 50 years.
6990 2018-02-16 23:09:44 Russia hacked my brain to make me believe u.s. bombs innocent people for oil!
I mean, the gall!!!
6991 2018-02-16 23:09:34 You need to check your history: British empire fought along side with Arab tribes to remove the ottoman empire, majority Arab Muslims refused the British so it was a battle field to resist. In the 19th century the west discovered  the oil in the Middle East.

7004 2018-02-16 23:07:06 Extracted oil has had a remarkable run. And the advantages it has provided have been enormous.  

But we are moving into a new age and we’re going to get there much sooner than people think

7015 2018-02-16 23:06:07 oh yes. trust me i am 100% against the locker room rhetoric. things only change once they get here. mgmt always seems to lose hope and the players follow. being an oil fan since an early age is probably the reason i’m more amused by this chaos than disturbed
7016 2018-02-16 23:05:43 french onion soup ! you cana make croutons - slice about half an inch, drizzle olive oil, bit of salt. bake at 300 for about 30 min. if not crunchy enough put back for another 10 min or so.
keep in ziploc bag for a week or two.

7020 2018-02-16 23:04:50 If he's a player turned pundit what does that make you?

Pundits of the left and right are destroying our country :(

7030 2018-02-16 23:02:49 Shale producers bring up three components. Crude oil, Natural Gas and water. Water is pumped back down, crude and gas is captured. I read perhaps 4 months ago the U. S. had no more storage capacity for NG. Even the pipelines were full. Port Arthur could not unload enough.

7034 2018-02-16 23:02:37 An indirect way to kill the pipeline is to tank oil prices. Join China, UK, Germany and France in banning gas engine cars and heavily promote electric vehicles by giving rebates, tax deductions, free parking and ferry rides

He was going to drain the swamp, yet he hired big energy and big oil for his cabinet. 2. He was going to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it, yet he wants the us to pay. There was no Russian interference, yet 13 Russians indicted.

7048 2018-02-16 23:01:00 sadly SV lives in an a-historical bubble and they think "it's different" when clearly it's not. They should look up what happened to Standard Oil, movie studios and AT&T, all trustbusted by SCOTUS. They won't and that's their Achilles heel IMO. @pmarca your thoughts ?

7052 2018-02-16 23:00:21 They are the best paid because Alberta is the wealthiest province in the country. Alberta is the wealthiest province because of the oil and gas sector. Do you think dr Suzuki told the teachers that as a consequence of “leaving it the ground”, they would all take 15% salary cuts?
7053 2018-02-16 23:00:19 Do you have synthetic oil or regular oil though?

7065 2018-02-16 22:58:21 Again it’s an attack on an industry on a province just try please try not to sensationalize or lie. Attack Oil Industry is enough on message for you to not resort to Hyperbole yet again!
7066 2018-02-16 22:58:20 Thank You.  And, with cars going electirc, if we also stop using plastic, all the oil can stay in the ground.
7067 2018-02-16 22:58:13 I would have chosen oil or powder you feel better now

He's about to control oil out of Syria/Genie Energy.
7070 2018-02-16 22:57:49 That should definitely be part of it. That needs to be fixed as well. Didn’t they stop that when Bosworth was making $Thousands to watch oil wells go up and down?

7075 2018-02-16 22:57:25 We CAN agree on some things :) I think the issues of guns, & violence, are human interaction & better solved by active social intervention. Climate will solve itself with more electric/hybrid vehicles. Oil will fade in the transition to the future.
7076 2018-02-16 22:57:23 @seanhannity give it up. Your president collided and committed obstruction of justice. Admit it. You’re just as stupid as Trump. No one’s buying your snake oil and lies. You’ve dried up. Btw watch out for #MeToo.

7084 2018-02-16 22:55:03 And you don't have to ALWAYS get an oil change just as long as you keep oil in it and make sure the transmission fluid is up your car will always run those are your main fluids other from gas
7085 2018-02-16 22:55:00 The difference here is that I believe your cure for me is really snake oil.  Whether you actually realize what is in the bottle, I'm not sure.
7086 2018-02-16 22:54:57 I gave the dogs coconut oil with their food because I ready it’s good for their coats and blah blah but now Rebel won’t even eat without coconut oil on her food  I made my dog high maintenance 
7087 2018-02-16 22:54:56 Scott Pruitt is another rip-them-off phony who denies the most basic science about climate change in order to please his oil company sponsors.

7095 2018-02-16 22:54:03 that. works as well.

7103 2018-02-16 22:52:40 IMO no comments show main driver. biggest shift:ran out of cheap oil capacity we had since 80s, &massively expanded a financial-system pricing “cheap oil forever”.  #Energy basis in household expenditures up 3x in 2000s,still well above now even w/shale:

7107 2018-02-16 22:52:04 It's just not true that
Nature = expensive = good 
Synthetic = cheap = bad.
Natural orange oil is €40 a kilo if you buy enough and restricted to 6% on the skin.
Ambroxan is €450 a kilo and totally safe.
People who don't understand chemistry and biology use intuition badly.
7108 2018-02-16 22:52:00 I am so 'brain washed' by Indian cooking, that Ottolenghi's use of 1 Tblspn of black mustard seeds without popping them in oil first, makes me cringe. Such better flavours if popped. I can't bring myself to use them as-is.
7109 2018-02-16 22:51:44 I’m pretty sure that I could argue that the lore of splatoon is a heavy handed metaphor for oil reserves in the style of dune

7176 2018-02-16 22:42:36 Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its military intervention in Ukraine, and then again for meddling in the 2016 election.  These sanctions stopped a $500 billion JV oil drilling project between Rosneft and Mobil. Trump tried to lift Obama's sanctions his first week in office.

7187 2018-02-16 22:41:07 It's also in our interest. Heck, it's in Russia's interest to stop producing oil. That's one of the issues the folks opposing Putin are running on; that he won't allow the kind of diverse economy where Russia can thrive.

7225 2018-02-16 22:34:33 It's in their interest to have us stop producing oil to the extent possible. Our fracking is killing them, and our exports will bury them.

7235 2018-02-16 22:33:32 I don't know about the pipeline protests (though I fail to see how a pipeline or US fracking is in the Russian interests as RU econ is based on oil) but IMO the reason Russia has been so successful here is that Americans and Russians are in some fundamental way very similar.

7257 2018-02-16 22:30:11 even better when fried in peanut oil!
7258 2018-02-16 22:30:10 @linorulli @catholicguyshow Tom Leapold is hilarious! Motor oil equals comic relief #LMAO 
7259 2018-02-16 22:30:02 @NafsikaT Vegetsble oil is just a palatable term for industrial oil. Sadly most of us only learn about these things after we have used them for years. I now just use butter and olive oil ( sometimes cold pressed rapeseed oil)
7260 2018-02-16 22:29:38 While we`re at it let`s ...

Stop Canada`s $3.4 BILLION Annual Subsidy to Oil+Gas, as promised.
7261 2018-02-16 22:29:23 Was really Disappointed Wednesday Morning  to discover that my Oil Tank was Drained out completely must have happened over the weekend cant understand why people are so cruel and unthoughtful for others needs and property there was well over 300 Euro taken
7262 2018-02-16 22:29:21 That's my fave part - when Oil fan says "well BOS passed on Barzal 3 times; why don't u chastise them?"
a) I/we do
b) Keith Gretzky was running their draft
#KillShot
7263 2018-02-16 22:29:14 Also, if you think thousands of people who have dedicated their lives to studying this stuff are perpetrating a hoax, you don't understand the way science works. Seems far more likely you're motivated not admit the harm because of bias via employment in the oil and gas industry.
7264 2018-02-16 22:29:03 #forex Gold, Crude Oil Prices Extend Gains as US CPI Impact Lingers: Gold and crude oil prices continue to edge higher, reveling in US Dollar weakness triggered after Wednesday’s underwhelming US CPI data. #forexsignals
7265 2018-02-16 22:28:53 someone said white people have lice because they don’t oil their hair and i’m like  lice goes after dirty hair lol. i’ve never had lice so
7266 2018-02-16 22:28:42 Try going up a reed strength, also give it a grease/ oil (if it’s wooden lol) and make sure none of the pads are sticking :) x
7267 2018-02-16 22:28:24 Lemon juice, tee tree oil and bicarbonate soda is the way forward!
7268 2018-02-16 22:28:20 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
7269 2018-02-16 22:27:57 Sorry yes oil and garlic obv
7270 2018-02-16 22:27:55 when i get home i'm likely going to have a small fitting that i've needed to properly complete the vacuum chamber project

so i might stream that tonight!! if the silicone gasket rework from last night has cured..

watch me soak my room in vacuum oil and dow corning grease
7271 2018-02-16 22:27:52 1- remove the rust 2-coat with vegetable oil 3- add heat to "season" the cast iron 4- clean lightly after use (while still hot) with water (never use soap) . . . a light spray of water on the hot iron will make most food particles fall away easily 5- maintain a light coat of oil
7272 2018-02-16 22:27:36 Thank you! >< not sure what caused it, but I feel a bit better after applying efficascent oil
7273 2018-02-16 22:27:25 Whole productive day ruined because Baytown GMC took 2 hours for an oil change and a tire rotation.
7274 2018-02-16 22:26:49 2. The military only took the oil fields as a means to limits the enemys access to oil to operate vehicles not to fuel your car sweetie
7275 2018-02-16 22:26:45 An oil spill has been cleaned up; all lanes open. in #Escondido on I-15 NB before Via Rancho Pky, stopped traffic back to Camino Del Norte
7276 2018-02-16 22:26:13 Pull in to get an oil change, get given iced tea, U2 starts playing on the radio, like damn. Must be my day.
7277 2018-02-16 22:26:00 One time my cousin caught her babydaddy cheating so she put castor oil in his coffee & he was shitting so much he had to go to the ER. A legend.
7278 2018-02-16 22:26:00 Had the oil changed in my Pathfinder, front desk lady noticed my @Carvana license plate holder and asked if I got to do the actual car vending machine. Sadly, I did not, but told her about delivery and 7 day test drive...she was on the fence, but now sold! #TheNewWayToBuyACar
7279 2018-02-16 22:26:00 And that box be slippery like trynna walk on oil 
7280 2018-02-16 22:25:55 Quad really got out on the side of the road and put oil in that Porsche lmfaooooooooo
7281 2018-02-16 22:25:41 True.
Oh. While you`re up..
Stop Canada`s $3.4 BILLION Annual Subsidy to Oil+Gas, as promised.
7282 2018-02-16 22:25:32 @ahmed_nihan’s brain: 1% Oil & 99% Nothing 
7283 2018-02-16 22:25:31 It was more than “Why not”? 
Russia must destroy USA renewable energy to continue oil dependence
7284 2018-02-16 22:25:31 That's a really interesting read. So they just hedged over ST but still want the long exposure... I'm thinking oil stays bid until Aramco; weak USD still acts as a tailwind; but longer term I'm an oil bear 
7285 2018-02-16 22:25:31 Baluchistan is an immediate concern for India. The edge in Indian Ocean and the oil supply is seriously undermined if Gawdar and land link to it via PoK is established (opinion). 2/2. Nice chat, bye.
7286 2018-02-16 22:25:27 1- remove the rust 2-coat with vegetable oil 3- add heat to "season" the cast iron 4- clean lightly after use (while still hot) with water (never use soap) . . . a light spray of water on the hot iron will make most food particles fall away easily 5- maintain a light coat of oil
7287 2018-02-16 22:25:14 The oil in the frying pan popped and burned my forehead.
7288 2018-02-16 22:24:57 Got my #TeaTree balm from @beardbrand quicker than expected and there was even a free sample of #TempleSmoke oil. Nice touch people #Salute
7289 2018-02-16 22:24:53 Palm oil is not juice bro. Too important to toy with
7290 2018-02-16 22:24:51 The price of snake oil in Auburn continues to rise .......
7291 2018-02-16 22:24:46 While you`re up..
Stop Canada`s $3.4 BILLION Annual Subsidy to Oil+Gas, as promised.
7292 2018-02-16 22:24:17 Primary recommendations; Texas in the Russia indictments; P. Bush's secret mansion & its financing exposed; Anti-wimp update; Oil & gas rig count; Tx school safety; Lefty labor union endorses Seliger, Estes, Ken King & Four Price + news of Texas, 5 to 7pm, Pratt on Texas
7293 2018-02-16 22:23:50 Oh. While you`re up..
Stop Canada`s $3.4 BILLION Annual Subsidy to Oil+Gas, as promised.Oh
7294 2018-02-16 22:23:46 And the entire oil industry? What is the exact same mechanisms that urge us back into our border states. She feared she was Sec of State.
7295 2018-02-16 22:23:35 i agree that Russian bots probably helped stage anti-fracking demonstrations
Our exports are killing oil prices for them
7296 2018-02-16 22:23:30 I have two jars of Nutella at home and no one wants to touch it... I don't get the hype on this mix of sugar and palm oil. 

Peanut butter tho 
7297 2018-02-16 22:23:06 While you`re up..
Stop Canada`s $3.4 BILLION Annual Subsidy to Oil+Gas, as promised.
7298 2018-02-16 22:23:04 An area equivalent size of 300 football fields of rainforest is cleared each hour to make way for palm oil production. This is destroying our planet when there are better alternatives. #saynotopalmoil
7299 2018-02-16 22:23:01 Oil, I don't think it is anymore, maybe that is why they are letting the shit hit the fan. I have no idea.
7300 2018-02-16 22:22:36 今日は羽生day
7301 2018-02-16 22:22:16 Good call. I'm probably on their radar too.  Oh well, I dont plan to go to Europe so they can put out a wareant all they want.
7302 2018-02-16 22:22:06 I had an insane day at work, burned my wrist on hot oil which is hurting like hell, and a bra wire broke. So I think I'll just sit here at my desk and eat non-dangerous food the rest of the evening.
7303 2018-02-16 22:22:05 NEW IndigoPro oil cartridges are NOW IN STOCK!! GSC, Jack Herer, Buddhas Smile (CBD), Sugar Plum, Gorilla Glue, and MORE!!
7304 2018-02-16 22:21:46 Lucic has good heart. Doesn't get pushed around. Oil didn't learn from ducks series.  Gotta beat em in the alley. Get rid of the lightweights except Nuge cuz he has skill. Caggiula Strome Cammalleri Benning Sekera small and mediocre skills. There's some heart: Kassian Nurse Slepy
7305 2018-02-16 22:21:36 It speaks in volume to us. Kids r being taught that oil is bad and that’s wrong
7306 2018-02-16 22:21:21 i'll try that if the vitamin E/rosehip oil doesn't work!
7307 2018-02-16 22:21:20 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
7308 2018-02-16 22:21:16 Certainly, Sir, like #Norway - sovereign wealth fund is divesting oil and gas.  @RachelNotley #BCWine
7309 2018-02-16 22:21:10 I’m such a fucking idiot. I left my backpack in my truck so now I’ve got nothing to do while my oil gets changed! 
7310 2018-02-16 22:20:19 That's what I don't understand, the government knows the truth. And they cover it up, beat it down. And carry on like nothing is happening. But why, why don't they do something about this. Or is oil money more important
7311 2018-02-16 22:20:17 In the West Wing, John Kasich admits to Rick Perry that Russian spies are drilling for oil. An adorable orphan collects a welfare check.
7312 2018-02-16 22:20:11 dhc cleansing oil
7313 2018-02-16 22:19:51 No chilli sauce; home made chilli oil
7314 2018-02-16 22:19:20 The squeakiest wheel gets the most oil... 

Let that sink in for a moment.
7315 2018-02-16 22:19:20 Today’s a good day because I finally got my oil changed so now my engine won’t blow up...cause it was probably secs from doing so
7316 2018-02-16 22:19:12 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇

7319 2018-02-16 22:19:06 I bought a skeet gun. Background check took so long it *timed* out. Shop called, got my gun. A month later the shop called and said my clearance came through. Great job. What if....
7320 2018-02-16 22:18:35 Ahh...give him a little CBD for dog oil Jim.

7322 2018-02-16 22:18:17 I'm going to close my eyes and buy this castor oil. I hope it works
7323 2018-02-16 22:18:10 If she has the Kriti prefix it means she has been acquired by Vardinoyiannis (AVIN/Motor Oil). Probably sold by Ancora to AVIN (Vardinoyiannis family)
7324 2018-02-16 22:18:09 Well, two things—yes, it would be easier to match but the employee needs to complete certain competency based items, and for the most part people have already committed to walking and don’t really give us the opportunity.  The oil and gas industry is tough that way.
7325 2018-02-16 22:18:08 Not that I think Brossoit is a big loss, but bringing in Montoya too late may now cost them LB. Had LB played all the games Montoya has, he'd be a game away from remaining RFA. Instead, Oil are 2 Montoya GP away from surrendering 4th instead of 5th & likely losing LB for nothing.
7326 2018-02-16 22:17:48 I hope I’m not the only one so angry about our government being bought by gun lobby, oil & gas, billionaires. The latest shooting is in the politicicians hands.
7327 2018-02-16 22:17:39 Naw, he needs to be slowly dipped into boiling oil feet first at half inch increments and everytime he passes out from shock hes brought back and it starts again until this puke is bones and meat paste.
7328 2018-02-16 22:17:35 Well, we could punish Russia by...
Arms sales to Ukraine 
Building up our military 
Encouraging domestic oil and gas drilling 
Signing sanctions bill

Oh wait, Trump did all that.
7329 2018-02-16 22:17:32 Apparently political facebook trolling is a graver concern to our election integrity than what Hillary/DNC did to Sanders.  Who knew?
7330 2018-02-16 22:17:27 Any country that refuses to recognize Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel will face oil embargo from the Rep of Biafra. Biafra would cut off our oil sales to these countries very soon
7331 2018-02-16 22:17:16 If I have a puddle of oil underneath my car that’s a bad thing right?
7332 2018-02-16 22:17:09 If you don’t like that dirty oil .... don’t use it . As in everything , try staying warm without it or any type of travel or .... pretty much your whole existence.
7333 2018-02-16 22:17:07 I think my adult son is more virgin than this extra virgin olive oil I'm gonna cook with. 

I wished he'd get laid. He'd be easier to tolerate...
7334 2018-02-16 22:16:49 Now that I've mentioned about it. I should probably consider doing "witchcraft" such as oil, or something and have my sister help me with scented candles since she's really good at it.
7335 2018-02-16 22:16:49 KATIE COME TO MY FORTRESS WE WILL POUR HOT OIL ON THE MARAUDING PRO-BUCATINI HORDES
7336 2018-02-16 22:16:43 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
7337 2018-02-16 22:16:33 Great question! You don't need any specialized tools to cook with us, but utensils, a sheet pan, oven safe skillet and medium pot with lid are a good place to start. Also don't forget salt, pepper and cooking oil of your choice!
7338 2018-02-16 22:16:23 Got my lavender essential oil running and my lavender incense burning

7343 2018-02-16 22:16:06 You know what makes me most happy about this (expected) plot twist? Very soon you'll be useless for Vlad and he'll release the #PeeTapes just for shits and giggles and to pour some more oil into the fire that will burn you. Popcorn time!
7344 2018-02-16 22:16:05 @LindaMcQuaig says Big Oil.

7347 2018-02-16 22:15:36 @Audi @AudiOfficial   Do you stand behind your loyal customers or dealerships who say one thing and do another?
@AudiGreenwich seems to represent the latter. Their service department definitely in need of a repair and an oil change! #enthusiast #unenthused #sad
7348 2018-02-16 22:15:31 it is ALWAYS something right after an oil change or a gas fillup..without fail
7349 2018-02-16 22:15:29 That oil Putin can't get because of sanctions is worth a TON of money.
7350 2018-02-16 22:15:17 While I will agree that the psychological state of mass murderers is beyond questionable, I haven't reviewed the medication list of each one and I won't jump on the anti-big pharma bandwagon without solid evidence. There's plenty of other solid issues to blame ahead of that one.
7351 2018-02-16 22:15:10 Throughout the day. Everyday. Don't know the actual amount though. I'd say a few grams as oil and dried flower
7352 2018-02-16 22:15:02 I suspect big pharma and oil & gas are bigger; we just do not hear as much about them.
7353 2018-02-16 22:14:56 agree to disagree. I feel like a lot of people's political agenda is to conform others to their way of thinking however that must happen and also to take as much oil supply as they can, but that's neither here nor there.

7355 2018-02-16 22:14:50 So the job growth/creation Liberals speak of when avoiding answering a question on ethics, calling Canadians Nazi's or gender issues in REMOTE oil projects etc is all just noise because Canadians really are losing jobs without another?! Shame!!! Virtue signalling instead of jobs?
7356 2018-02-16 22:14:44 Current industry economical benchmark for CO2EOR is $50/Tonne for the oil or gas (kJ) but if you use this as a method of CCS too (Aust Govt & People need to know it’s a viable option that works now) then it’s whatever price we want for our CO2 storage / oil independence.
7357 2018-02-16 22:14:36 You nailed it!
7358 2018-02-16 22:14:28 I know. When I was a kid, I loved all the magic carpet stuff and Tales of the Arabian Nights long before we had ever heard of Islam. Remember 'Open Sesame'?  I thought it was thrilling and then sticking the bad blokes in boiling oil. Perfect child's reading. No nightmares at all
7359 2018-02-16 22:13:59 all on a diesel, oil cooled mainframe from Victorian era.
7360 2018-02-16 22:13:46 They are made from old oil drums, nice piece of decoration.
7361 2018-02-16 22:13:40 buy a vape pen and a bunch of oil for it and they'll never know ;(

7363 2018-02-16 22:13:13 Chef Gusteau cut up some rotten zucchini, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with Play-Doh.
7364 2018-02-16 22:13:12 You SAY you oppose taxes. But you are willfully blind to the ancillary costs and to the taxes forced upon us by our use of oil
7365 2018-02-16 22:13:01 I’d settle for an HK MP5
7366 2018-02-16 22:12:50 Yeah  very tasty grilled with garlic, olive oil and lemon juice 
7367 2018-02-16 22:12:45 The middle lane is blocked for an oil spill. in #Escondido on I-15 NB before Via Rancho Pky, stopped traffic back to Camino Del Norte
7368 2018-02-16 22:12:35 Also, might say someone who doesn't think there is a good use for an AR-15 is not fit to tell others what to do about one.
7369 2018-02-16 22:12:35 Snake oil peddler.  Same as Trump.
7370 2018-02-16 22:12:21 Nothing Is Wasted In My Home, I will Make an Infused Oil with It! It Came In a Really Nice Packaged Box and Paperwork..TY.
7371 2018-02-16 22:12:15 そういやFYさん好きそうな絵柄だな
7372 2018-02-16 22:12:15 As of today politics equals religion. Without religion there would be far less oppressors. Then people would be more willing to share their land and oil and less willing to use their guns.
7373 2018-02-16 22:12:14 I didn't realize other countries knew what it was till now either   guess it's a Caribbean term 
7374 2018-02-16 22:11:36 Oil change and levels getting checked ...
7375 2018-02-16 22:11:35 Shale oil reserves in southern ab are said to be larger than US but we are little queers who let them dictate us. Very sad. Many such cases
7376 2018-02-16 22:11:26 @EminenceOrganic #EminenceWinter Rosehip triple c+e firming oil !!!
7377 2018-02-16 22:11:18 What oil pan?
7378 2018-02-16 22:11:18 Beard oil
7379 2018-02-16 22:11:13 I can appreciate that. I hope you found someone else to oil his chest for the victory photo shoot though.
7380 2018-02-16 22:11:09 How was the cheapest if you factor in the cost of the wars to protect the supply. 
Of course you’re dishonest and would never factor in something like that. 
Wars to protect oil are, in fact, a form of subsidy
7381 2018-02-16 22:11:02 Finally got around to getting an oil change
7382 2018-02-16 22:11:01 Surprisingly no. I think it’s oil free
7383 2018-02-16 22:10:50 Need some oil sheen on that head 
7384 2018-02-16 22:10:47 And they include so much waste in the packaging in the kit bits of this and little amounts of oil in a one-use disposable bottle. It's disastrous for the environment and our kids futures.
7385 2018-02-16 22:10:42 Putting palm oil on d 41 list caused an instant diversion to d domestic market. We r all witnesses to how it created a scarcity for basic consumption and prices shot up by over 300%. Yet less than 50% of need was being met and everyone blamed pmb
7386 2018-02-16 22:10:35 Well they send their sons and daughters off to die for some oil to control the heroin. Well son I hope you don't grow up believing you've gotta be a puppet to be a man.

7389 2018-02-16 22:10:11 RT @LivingSafely: #Lays Smooth #Ranch Dip this February? Top four ingredients are water, oil, modified tapioca and corn starch.
7390 2018-02-16 22:10:03 the oil companies should buy him a plane
7391 2018-02-16 22:09:54 Coconut, or Castro oil works too
7392 2018-02-16 22:09:29 The Canadian oil and gas industry now employs about 180,000 workers, which is only one per cent of Canada’s total jobs, and almost 100,000 fewer jobs than Canada’s environmental and clean technology industries. #ClimateAction #RenewableEnergy
7393 2018-02-16 22:09:10 This is purgatory folks. Try to leave it better than we found it.  Spirits hover round the enter gaps and exit gaps of human existence @aarp @actsfullgospel
Don't need to be reminded of this by snake oil merchants evry damn minute thank you
7394 2018-02-16 22:09:09 And why are they the best paid in the country?  And because they are they should feel indebted to the mighty inventors of oil?  Give it a rest
7395 2018-02-16 22:09:02 i mix it with the clay for a face mask like once a week. i just mixed it with tea tree oil and water and used it on my scalp! hopefully it works :)
7396 2018-02-16 22:09:00 My car had a full service, all new filters, full oil change, new spark plugs m, new brake pads and discs and he fixed my fucking stupid window washers today.
7397 2018-02-16 22:08:57 It seems the story so far is:

Russians get aggressive with their neighbors. US imposes economic sanctions, conspires to gut oil prices. Russian economy starts declining. #Russia responds by investing in cyber and political warfare (propaganda) w/ the US.

VP Dick Cheney (Halliburton) gave me the Creeps
7401 2018-02-16 22:08:42 Hope to do it one year.  Focused on running 280ish miles of the AT, a few 50Ks and Oil Creek as my WS qualifier this year.

7403 2018-02-16 22:08:14 Vitamin D is good for if you live in places that don't have a lot of sun, especially places like Washington, Oregon, British Columbia, basically a ton of places up north that don't get a lot of sun.

I take Cod Liver Oil pills along with my vitamins to help me get more Vitamin D.

7405 2018-02-16 22:07:50 Heartwarming to know that our brave soldiers will be there to protect the interests of a Texas oil company.

7408 2018-02-16 22:07:23 people aren't just fighting over that. they're fighting over political gains, oil, guns, land, and most importantly freedom from their oppressors.
7409 2018-02-16 22:07:22 But you always clap at me on my heaux posts. You can’t be slicker than an oil can, heaux. Lol

7415 2018-02-16 22:06:39 Can we talk about how irritated I am that I just spent money on oil to go in my car only to get into a car accident literally minutes later 
7416 2018-02-16 22:06:36 Complicit. He’s knee deep in Russian oil and business deals. Trump Tower Moscow was suppose to be his reward
7417 2018-02-16 22:06:36 If there was an isis flag, they would have found a falafel cart he ate at once, called him a muslim convert, planted hummus in his pocket and invaded any Oil rich country not named Saudi Arabia.
7418 2018-02-16 22:06:17 Did you know there are parts of your car that should be checked regularly? Make sure a processional looks at your oil, tires and brakes.

7434 2018-02-16 22:03:33 It depends on what you have on hand and how your skin reacts. Id say vitamin E oil, coconut oil ( it depends if it breaks you out), rosehip, jojoba oil, argan oil?

7442 2018-02-16 22:02:38 You do exactly what you accuse him of. How many engineers oil workers geologists do you invite to speak. Probably none so practice what you preach.

7446 2018-02-16 22:01:56 Most major drilling companies have plenty of cash and do not need a loan. Some very small operations (small compared to Nabors)  have lots of money and bring oil up with prices over $45-$55 for even more $$.
7447 2018-02-16 22:01:56 @PreetBharara Just learned that Tesla is not allowed to sell cars in Michigan and Texas, presumably due to cars and oil, but isn't that a form of monopoly?  And is the only reason that's not news is because DOJ is kind of busy?

7469 2018-02-16 21:59:55 What?? I have a major dilemma. I grew up in Alberta and support pipelines....but at the expense of public transit? Trudeau is insane...transit and oil go hand in hand. But I think he's trying to have transit rally behind the pipeline to get their funding in order?

7495 2018-02-16 21:56:06 Lol. They can’t agree to sell because of the Oil. Unless they are buying it themselves.

7497 2018-02-16 21:55:36 Finally watched this and it left me with two thoughts:

2 - wait, have you ever had violet candy (i.e. Parma Violets) before??
7498 2018-02-16 21:55:34 I’ve found just mixing it in a bottle works great no need for a hand blender K breaks up a lot easier then J also that cream replace with coconut oil and clove oil but whatever works for you

7501 2018-02-16 21:54:43 1. Exersice and you will want to eat healthy.
2. Overload your plate with veg and protein and make carbs the smallest group.
3. Keep it balanced....use butter and olivie oil to make it taste scrumptious. 
4. Be inspired by other food  cultures.

7517 2018-02-16 21:51:52 Alberta needs to reduce emissions by 45% below their current plan by 2030 to meet Canada's Paris commitment and the only way they can do that is to cut back oil sands production. There is no other option to meet Paris.

7529 2018-02-16 21:50:47 My argument to the pipeline haters is that 1000's of trains and trucks it would take to haul the same amount of fuel a pipeline can haul, burn more gas and put more pollutants into the air then any oil spill ever did on the ground.

7542 2018-02-16 21:49:37 what i'm hearing is that vitamin E is what really targets dark spots? i have pure vitamin E oil at home, do u think that would work?
7543 2018-02-16 21:49:17 Spare us the outrage. The oil and gas industry has always gotten favorable treatment by the government and you are pissing and moaning about a union of educators hiring someone to speak about pollution? How very Trumpian of you.

7547 2018-02-16 21:47:58 A good Q to ask when confronted with job stats from oil industry.  How  many renewable energy, fishing, and recreational jobs are you killing with this new fossil fuel infrastructure?  Thx. to @MikeHudema
7548 2018-02-16 21:47:54 Hmm....if only to complete my "eccentric oil baroness" look....
7549 2018-02-16 21:47:32 If it turns out that actual displacement rates for the additional supply spurred by 45Q are closer to 50% than the IEA model's 80%, all of a sudden every barrel of CO2-EOR-produced oil could indeed be net-emitting, not net-sequestering.
7550 2018-02-16 21:47:23 From what the public can see, Trump allows Coal and Oil interests to run EPA, Goldman Sachs to run Treasury, special interests to call the shots and overturn regs protecting working men and women, and roll back the rights of women, minorities and the disabled.  Trump is a toadie
7551 2018-02-16 21:47:22 Enmity toward renewable energy is fierce among gvts, banks, & investors in oil, gas, auto, fossil-fuel power plants. They stand to write-off $20 trillion.

7553 2018-02-16 21:46:59 Yes. They're Faber castell polychromos, which are oil based & there are lots of layers of colour, which gives it dimension. 

But to me it won't *really* look solid until I add shadows... which I'll do for all 56 cards together at the end, to ensure they're consistent!

7562 2018-02-16 21:44:34 I'm beginning to think the permian basin's NG production as a by product of oil is adding to supply.
7563 2018-02-16 21:44:31 So, minus the unexpected $300+ I have to drop on my car for tires, THIS HAS BEEN AN EXCELLENT AND PRODUCTIVE DAY. Not even 2pm and I am 90% done with my homework for the day. And I got a massage and went to spin and got an oil change and I'm just killing it. BLESS UP, FAM. 
7564 2018-02-16 21:44:14 It goes on at a certain time i’m srry. and maybe tiff should be more responsible and change her oil 
7565 2018-02-16 21:43:44 just like mafia bosses: here are the tools and here are some consigliores(lobbyists). We’ll just look the other way and keep on selling “olive oil”
7566 2018-02-16 21:43:35 Hug your gun. Stroke it while you oil it. 17 lives yesterday. Kids and teachers.
7567 2018-02-16 21:43:32 Alberta's job right now should be to give ppl in BC the truth. The truth in how some oil/fuels are being transported and their safety records.
I read a stat that claimed in North America, there is a train derailment every 6 seconds.
7568 2018-02-16 21:43:12 if you replace leaking oil on a weekly basis you can skip planned oil changes right?

7686 2018-02-16 21:26:01 Gas or oil fracked as its a private concern and only shareholders will earn. At least in us its made gas and oil cheaper for citizens. So basically govt can invade your land and what is found there belongs to foreign investors and you have no rights at all. As well as being frack

7691 2018-02-16 21:24:55 They are already sanctioned. Low oil prices. Their oil-and-gas sector is 16% of their GDP, 52% of federal budget revenues & 70% of their exports. They invaded Ukraine under a weak Obama Presidency, not Trump.  Trump just blows them up in Syria when they misbehave.

7693 2018-02-16 21:24:51 Let’s not forget that Turkey helped create ISIS and was complicit in the illegal oil trade of stolen Syrian oil with ISIS. Even today Turkey is still using Al Qaeda as its proxy terror army against the Syrian people. This the real Turkey people should know about!

7698 2018-02-16 21:23:04 Curiously, BC ENGOs tend to downplay the threat that Salish Sea marine oil spills pose to endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales, focusing instead on other threats. I’ve never seen a credible explanation for this trend.

7702 2018-02-16 21:22:40 Introducing yet another tax like the Carbon tax will not help competitiveness, closing down Oil projects in Canada while shipping in oil from Saudi Arabia doesn't help or create jobs here. The fact that ON is forcing business out doesn't help economy nor job market.

7800 2018-02-16 21:07:51 Nothing. Oil is a dying industry, only BigOil refuses to see that. Time for renewables to start working side by side with oil so the planet is ready when this finite resource is gone.

7811 2018-02-16 21:06:33 avacado, fish oil, eggs & hot sauce. the aftermath is a little terrifying.
7812 2018-02-16 21:06:33 Depends on the type of oil. Synthetic, which tends to work better with higher mileage vehicles, is always expensive. They might have used regular oil or maybe you're just that hot. Probably that.

7904 2018-02-16 20:52:50 trains and trucks are loaded with whatever needs to be moved at that time, no matter if it's bichumen or refined oil, I don't get your point, oil pipelines have to stop at some point in order to be able to deliver the product.

7913 2018-02-16 20:51:58 but i tell u something: we are just alarmists who need something to worry about so they look at oil accidents. and next time everyone will be wondering again: how could that possibly happen? u will see.

7954 2018-02-16 20:45:14 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
7955 2018-02-16 20:44:41 Seems to me that Trudeau wants to reduce CO2 emissions by shutting down the oil & gas industry in Alberta and shutting down the manufacturing sector in Ontario.

Not good.

7961 2018-02-16 20:44:13 Uhhh que mala noticia esa , y eso ecopetrol esta correlacionado con el price del oil ??
7962 2018-02-16 20:43:53 .25 cent gasoline increased will pay for infrastructure badly needed. Our oil production by 2019 will be the biggest in the world protecting America from OPEC raising oil prices at a whim. Remember 4.00 per gallon not to long ago. The is far better than tolls roads.
7963 2018-02-16 20:43:50 They're going to drill for more #oil in the Atlantic now... meanwhile the summer is nearing and the #hurricane season is not going to be fun this year.
7964 2018-02-16 20:43:44 You should respect each other and refrain from disputes; you should not, like water and oil, repel each other, but should, like milk and water, mingle together...
7965 2018-02-16 20:43:39 ... and I’d go with Oil Country.

7972 2018-02-16 20:42:52 maybe CTV should be telling Ontarians about Carolyn Mulroney's position on the Fraser Institute Board & her connection with Rebel Media. Rebel are racists & Fraser is a bogus charity (funded in part by American billionaire Koch Bros.) that shill for big oil & peddle privatization

7975 2018-02-16 20:42:31 Someone asked aunty what cream she used to tone her skin and aunty  said she’s using Johnson baby oil . I don’t know how hard it is for some girls to drop their beauty regimen they will just be dropping stupid lies.

8013 2018-02-16 20:37:15 Getting my oil changed: “The charge on your battery looks great.” Yeah I sure hope so because I just got a new one like a month ago.
8014 2018-02-16 20:37:13 The way it's going, with the backing of Russia who is trying to get a big foothold in the region, Syrian base etc, and Iran with oil supplies, I don't think Turkey will be worried about sanctions from the USA. And they control who can use their Incirlik air base. Strong hand.
8015 2018-02-16 20:37:03 Lead us to salvation pour that oil please

8018 2018-02-16 20:36:12 Went on my adventure! They had an awesome olive oil for me today so double exciting! Also picked up dog food at the pet store and a few things at the grocery store. Unloaded truck. Next 3: let guineas out to roam, put everything away, 5 minute pick up.

8029 2018-02-16 20:34:04 I’m convinced that no one actually know how to adult. We are all just faking it. “Yeah I understand how a 401K works” - “oh yeah let’s sign for a 5.6 interest rate on that mortgage” - “I know I need to put oil in my car” - it’s all a lie.
8030 2018-02-16 20:34:01 No dry shampoo on hand? A bit of baby powder soaks up oil until your next shower.
8031 2018-02-16 20:33:50 Technically the oil paid more cause our 4th rounder is a lot higher than a St. Louis 4th rounder

8033 2018-02-16 20:33:41 I was moreso replying towards you on oil and pipelines compared to other transportation methods. It’s hard to compare a heavy substance that would sink and spread across prime fishing zones to a substance that floats and the difference in scales of failures via transport methods

8043 2018-02-16 20:32:58 In addition to infrastructure and logistics considerations, I am curious if the protesters would be willing to examine the externalities of their lifestyles. Understanding supply and demand, one simple way we can all divest from oil is to choose a low carbon, plant based diet.
8044 2018-02-16 20:32:50 Is this oil free and natural it's just have sensitive skin

So I us a crayon and than oil. But she judge it before it was done and i had to oil the whole thing.
8056 2018-02-16 20:31:15 If you read On Anarchism by Noam Chomsky, he talks about how United States foreign policy drastically favoured the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. Businesses, especially oil companies, were allowed to sell to the fascists even with the Neutrality Act in place.
8057 2018-02-16 20:31:11 Key solution is to deal with the spread of palm oil into virgin rainforest. This requires international action by multinationals  driving the use of palm oil in so many products.
8058 2018-02-16 20:31:05 Get that oil out while you can... oil will be in much less demand in the near future as technology is making other forms of clean energy efficient and affordable. I’m sure you see this coming. If this gets stalled too long it won’t be worth it. Keep it in the ground!
8059 2018-02-16 20:31:05 Carrots. You ever throw some broccoli in the oven with some redskin potatoes, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper? It will shake you. Carrots are only good for Chicken Noodle Soup.
8060 2018-02-16 20:31:00 The only difference here is the portion (and maybe the oil it’s prepared with). Other than that same stuff... no?

8071 2018-02-16 20:28:54 Well the money doesn't come from Alberta. The oil industry is in the toilet. Stocks and sales are down. There is a world glut trying to get rid of the oil to pay for the losses. Is someone telling you Alberta is rich because of the #Tarsands?
8072 2018-02-16 20:28:28 Sanctions, oil, kompromat, and just an overall willingness to betray our country.
8073 2018-02-16 20:28:27 Oh snap! Russians being indicted...the SS Collusion will be pulling into harbor next and I bet your orange papa will be one of the first rats jumping ship! Just think of the environmental impact the oil slick from your greasy hair will cause when you jump ship too!
8074 2018-02-16 20:28:21 I know PUMA signed a PPA with the gov't to build a natural gas generation plant.  Presumably, generation should be easier to sell, there's already several private generators down here and hopefully, more to come using fuel sources other than oil.

that's like saying you're gonna dump oil on a fire, I mean, it's a liquid right? so surely it'll put it out.

8086 2018-02-16 20:26:53 While I do agree pipelines are generally “safer” than the other options, it’s not ideal to expand it into BC and put the burden on us. The safest option and greenest option is to stop relying so heavily on oil.
8087 2018-02-16 20:26:33 Ah oil rises to the surface again

8092 2018-02-16 20:26:15 A brand new World Bank report, The Changing Wealth of Nations 2018, offers evidence of how much poorer Africa is becoming thanks to rampant minerals, oil and gas extraction.

8102 2018-02-16 20:24:09 Yes, but what I said wasnt false. I never said it was only caused by urine. Skin oil and sweat as well as urine is still a gross and are responsible for the strong nostalgic pool smell we know. Water with chlorine and no other contaminates doesn’t have a smell.
8103 2018-02-16 20:24:01 .@POTUS instead of a tax on gasoline, how about a tax on foriegn oil? Raise $$ and help domestic suppliers!

8115 2018-02-16 20:22:35 How about enforcing those sanctions! Putin will make 500 Billion dollars from that much untapped oil. All pumped tax-free through Crimea, stolen from Ukraine, now owned by Russia. Putin may have subverted our government just to become the richest man!
** Trump will get 19% cut.

8125 2018-02-16 20:21:05 Correct me if I’m wrong but are we now producing more oil and gas than ever and isn’t that figure virtually going up by the day and will this not result in the price of fuel going down?
8126 2018-02-16 20:20:49 I remember the thing I learned in the kitchen that blew my mind most was that black pepper has water in it and that’s why it bubbles when you throw it in hot oil

A President that is,
- making our economy stronger,
- stronger military,
- a border wall,
- stronger infrastructure,
- energy independent
- the largest supplier of oil
That's what the Russians want?  Really?  American's Voted!  #MAGA!

8139 2018-02-16 20:19:37 It isn't. It's just chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, garlic and lemon juice. Most middle eastern food is very healthy.

Putin would be very angry

8154 2018-02-16 20:18:09 For bitumen to enter the ocean there would have to be a spill or leak, you're already assuming that it's an inevitable thing. Alberta does refine alot of oil they have to, it supplies a majority of Canada.
8155 2018-02-16 20:18:09 It is senseless when everybody arbitrarily talks about high or low PREPA costs, when a huge component of the PREPA cost is fuel, which in the last three years, for a barrel of oil, prices have fluctuated between 26 and 120 dollars
8156 2018-02-16 20:18:08 Ok, listen up class...

President Trump is making America the leading oil producer.

Putin is losing power, which is derived from his oil, which is where his money also comes from.

Much more powerful than silly sanctions.

It's chess vs checkers.

Class dismissed.
8157 2018-02-16 20:17:48 I've thrown out all my toiletries, fragrances  detergents and sprays. I use liquid castille soap, baking soda, vinegar, olive oil, salt, coconut oil and vodka for pretty much everything!

8161 2018-02-16 20:17:18 It's all about oil money, sanctions, and tax avoidance (money laundering). Putin knows if Hillary would have won, Russia would not be selling oil to the US.

8173 2018-02-16 20:15:52 For a state in deep decline, they sure seem to be winning a lot: Syria, Iran, Crimea, gold reserves rising, engineered the oil supply cut deal, etc.
8174 2018-02-16 20:15:45 So if you fix gold to ~8500 CNY and launch a CNY oil contract, with USD depreciating, this would presumably make your CNY oil contract very attractive to oil sellers.

Did we over depend on Oil? YES! Now we are diversifying, it's a good step in the right direction that needs dedication & attention
8177 2018-02-16 20:15:11 This is why I love practicing law and am still at it nearly 40 years now. The strategy part is the best: anticipate what the other side(s) may do and be ready to boil them in oil regardless of which choice they make. Brilliant.

Morning, at night? 
Nope, after you shower. 
Apply your body cream or oil to dam skin, this is when your skin holds the most moisture and products then to work better when skin is already hydrated.

8327 2018-02-16 19:53:43 I am so suspicious of palm oil. I don't believe the word "sustainable" means a damn thing. I suspect eating it creates cravings.
8328 2018-02-16 19:53:35 Bow and arrows are just as harmful. So are knives, swords, spears, socks filled with dirt and stones, 2 x 4 soaked in motor oil, etc. What is the common factor are people.

-spearmint (mentha viridis (spearmint) leaf oil)
-cedarwood (cedrus atlantica)
-patchouli (pogostemum cablin)
SOOOO GOOD

8336 2018-02-16 19:52:32 So by definition natural gas and oil are more efficient on a BTU/worker basis.  That is also one of the reasons why they provide a lower cost to the American consumers.  So the use of the term *energy efficiency* is #FakeNews.   #AllOfTheAbove #EndEnergySubsidies

8338 2018-02-16 19:52:20 Socialist induced? I didn’t think NAFTA, TPP, General Electric, sanctions & an embargo on oil sales was a socialist enterprise? This is not to mention the decades of CIA interference, drug running, regime change, political assassinations & the propping up of dictators in SA...
8339 2018-02-16 19:52:09 Rice grows annually. Palm oil takes 3-5yrs to grow and subsequently, it fruits bi-annually (I stand to be corrected). So intervention may not work like it did with rice. a ban will  drive prices upwards, and increase interest in palmoil from farmers. Efficiency will increase too.
8340 2018-02-16 19:52:01 #FakeNews You ended the #DACA program. Only stupid people believe the snake oil bull shit U're plying. It's unfathomable that 35% of Americans are so gullible/stupid.

8372 2018-02-16 19:48:56 In case anyone asks me in the future if I ever took drugs at a gig, do strepsils and olbas oil inhalers count?

8374 2018-02-16 19:48:45 You think she isn't already?
8375 2018-02-16 19:48:45 .@eni #GREED Stay way from the Beaufort sea. Stay way from the coastal plain.  Drilling proponents will turn one of our last wild, intact landscapes—sacred to the Gwich’in people—into an industrial oil field - @Earthjustice #ProtectANWR #ArcticDrilling @350 @Greenpeace
8376 2018-02-16 19:48:02 The do a ultrasound and my mum gasped! (My Mum had Breast cancer like 4 years prior which she beat coz GODS on the throne & Satan’s a bladclart and don’t no the oil ! )
8377 2018-02-16 19:47:51 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
8378 2018-02-16 19:47:49 That reminds me of when Tika put pure bug spray in her essential oil diffuser hahaha
8379 2018-02-16 19:47:49 He was president of Royal institute of oil painters, he does a lot of sunsets and big skies, I met him at a sol exhibition of his at a gallery in the Cotswolds, look him up when you get a chance
8380 2018-02-16 19:47:48 Aliens legal and illegal from all over the world are involved daily in political process. In my face everytime I turn on the T.V.
8381 2018-02-16 19:47:26 Canadian Conservatives: always with Big Oil and against our kids #cdnpoli
8382 2018-02-16 19:47:23 A cannabis flower doesn't need to be smoked.  And medical cannabis also comes in forms of oil and edibles.   So what's the problem?
8383 2018-02-16 19:47:16 Make sure they check the oil. Have a safe flight.
8384 2018-02-16 19:47:08 Shaving then putting coconut oil on>>>>>>
8385 2018-02-16 19:47:04 When I put coconut oil on my eyelashes I have to accept the fact that I'm going be partially blind for the next 12 hours so I might as well go sleep
8386 2018-02-16 19:46:59 Yeah, I tried cinnamon/vinegar/orange oil but they're still coming in, so we're gonna put some stuff in the shower and see what happens 
8387 2018-02-16 19:46:48 What a wonderful Friday morning this has been ...now time to change my oil and prepare for food truck 
8388 2018-02-16 19:46:48 Guo took the 30 Bil from Oil country but did not invest it as agreed but spent the money elsewhere.  Right there: improper civil /criminal acts, in any human society.  Does not matter if the society is capitalist or bad bad communist.  Defrauding others is defrauding others.
8389 2018-02-16 19:46:44 How does anyone believe Putin didn't hack the voting machines & tabulation servers when that is the ONLY way he gets the guaranteed outcome he needs to get the sanctions lifted for the Exxon Oil & Saudi Nuke Deals = Trump + Full GOP control to protect Trump? #ForensicCodeAudit
8390 2018-02-16 19:46:42 Just bought a charcoal stove for these girls who come and don't want to leave, 
She comes over and u tell her gas is over but get some money from the table & go buy charcoal & some cooking oil for 300shs

Walai she won't come back
8391 2018-02-16 19:46:33 No masks but I did have peppermint oil to block the smell. 
8392 2018-02-16 19:46:28 Where’s a diy brown sugar and coconut oil exfoliating rub when you really need one?
8393 2018-02-16 19:46:19 Holland and Barrett now sell Cannabis Oil. Just saying ... 
8394 2018-02-16 19:46:15 My oil changes are usually around $95 but today it’s only $35??? Okay either I’ve been getting royally fucked or this guy digs my face. 

I’m going with the first option tho.
8395 2018-02-16 19:46:11 Big Oil blocked progress on #cleanfuelsjobs—and WA will remain  for now the only west coast state lacking a Clean Fuels Standard. But #waleg still has plenty of opportunities this spring to #actonclimate! #100percentclean
8396 2018-02-16 19:46:05 Definitely sneaking a pint of oil in my pocket for the Culture
8397 2018-02-16 19:45:49 Koch brothers know the new energy technologies are very near and they need to sell as much oil as they can first.
8398 2018-02-16 19:45:48 Well yes ... the EU are 28 of the most prosperous nations on the planet, if you exclude the oil rich nations, we are most of them apart from the US, Japan and S.Korea. As for democracy the EU is literally a more democratic structure than the UK. Why exactly do you hate the EU?...
8399 2018-02-16 19:45:47 Наивные, они сначала нервы нам . А потом посмотрят.
8400 2018-02-16 19:45:21 Any idea how it affected the US & the oil industry in general at the time, thousands lost their jobs.They have started to make recovery now which is causing the drop in oil prices, also many countries have a glut of cheaper oil, so demand is lower
8401 2018-02-16 19:45:20 Reason #2 why I dislike Jimmy John's. Their. Hips are made in peanut oil and I can't have them at work. #stupidjimmy
8402 2018-02-16 19:44:58 He needs more money because making cakes with holy water and anointed oil is very expensive.
8403 2018-02-16 19:44:42 First the oil now this
8404 2018-02-16 19:44:12 Hummus is full of fiber. A 1 tbsp of commercially produced hummus has only 25 calories and only 0.2 g of unhealthy saturated fat. Classic recipe is a pureed mixture of cooked chickpeas, citrus juice and olive oil. You may also add garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, beetroot etc..
8405 2018-02-16 19:44:11 Oil money, beef money (and apparently allot of gun money) is what put him there, and some deranged people from the Tea party (remember that shit?).
8406 2018-02-16 19:43:39 China and UEA own the vast majority of the U.S. through loans and imports from their countries, whether everyday goods or oil. If they called in all those loans, the U.S. would be no more. Period.

8408 2018-02-16 19:43:27 Done that before in a new postal sorting office....hahahah took some explaining except mine where 6 @AmbiRad tube heaters and they where all burning the protective oil off the tube....you couldn’t see the woods for the smoke..
8409 2018-02-16 19:43:07 Uh-oh @molratty might be in trouble for her edgelord activities 
8410 2018-02-16 19:42:56 I get my car back on Monday and so I’m currently pampering my dad’s car with a new oil change and clean and vacuum. It’s been a good 10 months with the Fuckus.
8411 2018-02-16 19:42:48 Maybe tell Alberta to reine its dirty oil in province and then BC will be happy to ship it.
8412 2018-02-16 19:42:46 So what happens to all of the non-citizens who voted in the election?
8413 2018-02-16 19:42:36 Oil and then miscellar water
8414 2018-02-16 19:42:28 How do people use coconut oil to put off their makeup i CANT SEE ANYTHING EVERYTHING IS BLURRY
8415 2018-02-16 19:42:16 USA adminisration is a bloody killer. Trump,obama, bush and other former heads of state 
 struggle to muss and mingle the countries which have oil over the years.
8416 2018-02-16 19:42:11 I put cinnamon and orange oil and vinegar everywhere, but they're still invading our shower I think because it washes off every time we shower, and it's damp in there...it's such an old house and it's falling apart so I think they just live in the walls 
8417 2018-02-16 19:41:56 Funny how oil belongs to All Canadians when BC is supposed to roll over for pipelines, & yet when Alberta doesn't get auto-sway it's your oil.
Which is it?
8418 2018-02-16 19:41:54 Swear to god jon and I went into Lidl for cereal and we came out after spending £35 on things like lentil chips and 5l of olive oil
8419 2018-02-16 19:41:35 It always come down to oil ... 100 years ago it was Penguins. Today it is the oil fields. What will we be doing in a 100 years time?

8421 2018-02-16 19:41:25 Oil futures end higher, hold gains after rig-count data
8422 2018-02-16 19:40:58 Federal lands were set aside for all Americans. I will fight USG every step of the way if they try to take those lands. PBO was hardly a Marxist. Oil co came here years ago w a lease,we said no. Perhaps it's changed.
8423 2018-02-16 19:40:53 My dad does oil pulling and I never took it seriously but now Haley’s doing it so I’m about to be Boo Boo The Fool
8424 2018-02-16 19:40:50 wash hands, sanitizer,proper sleep,no comp. 2 hrs before bed, probiotics-at least 30 billion count, lots of greens, oil of oregano 3 drops under tongue hold for 2 min. swallow with h2o

Coman gimme coconut oil to sample, it's good for my beards
8426 2018-02-16 19:40:36 Godbless black girls like i came straight from school after washing my hands of oil so much it looked like i was wrist deep in flour but the bank teller gave me lotion i hope she has a good day #BlackHistoryMonth
8427 2018-02-16 19:40:32 And people say Russia doesn’t export anything but vodka, ballerinas & oil...
8428 2018-02-16 19:40:15 I swear this waterpump leaks more than oil pipes do in the gulf
8429 2018-02-16 19:40:09 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
8430 2018-02-16 19:40:05 Happened during the BP disaster too! Remember Kevin Costner trying to get them to even look at his oil separation technology? Wasn't all that good, but they didn't even want to look at it! They also got thousands of other ideas & scientific proposals that they never looked at!
8431 2018-02-16 19:39:53 Accidentally almost put avocado oil in my latte instead of vanilla syrup. 

Also, we have a new winner for most middle class sentence I've ever written.
8432 2018-02-16 19:39:52 Also, dealer actually sticks to the 5 mo/5,000 mile manufacturers’ recommendation for oil changes. Jiffy Lube still sticks 3 mo/3,000 mike sticker on there, like my car was made in the 90s or something
8433 2018-02-16 19:39:49 Do they burn whale oil or what?
8434 2018-02-16 19:39:47 @WoOLateModels on your website under points can you add asterisks next to the rookies and + or something to show who is running WoO vs. Lucas Oil.
8435 2018-02-16 19:39:38 Obama knew? Only money we know of came from Dems/ FBI. Who was in charge of Intel agencies back then? More to find out for sure.

8437 2018-02-16 19:39:09 Remembering that oil was sold at an average of $100/barrel throughout Akotileta Hero.
Roads and Rails, we were here when Hero was transporting the only 2 rail cabin he bought on load loader to campaign states. Today is not so. Name one road your Hero completed /3
8438 2018-02-16 19:39:04 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
8439 2018-02-16 19:38:59 Cristyan got me an oil pen and now I don’t know how to act, I’m walkin around getting high everywhere lmao
8440 2018-02-16 19:38:47 if you stroke them regularly with oil, they recognize you as the dominant one in the house, and begin to show obedience. None of mine have ever shot anybody either. Proud mama here.
8441 2018-02-16 19:38:41 Nice for Chinese New Year or at anytine. Enjoy.
8442 2018-02-16 19:38:32 I determine what I’m going to wear outside based off how my coconut oil is looking #BlackHistoryMonth
8443 2018-02-16 19:38:21 She got thrown out for telling which politicians were getting oil money but it was public records. She's a brave woman. I think we need to let Native Americans alone. We're robbed them enough & even committed genocide.
8444 2018-02-16 19:38:15 Thank you, Ornery!  It's all true!
8445 2018-02-16 19:38:13 Mine too.  In fact, I promised then a shot of gun oil before dinner if they continue to behave.
8446 2018-02-16 19:37:42 Akram 94#Valentines relve bautifull oil
8447 2018-02-16 19:37:42 Getting my oil changed and sitting in the waiting room surrounded by old people and I sneezed and no one said bless you... rude. I hate old people.
8448 2018-02-16 19:37:39 And these minimal risks will greatly reduced or eliminated by other methods of administration like vaping or using oil.  You anti-pot crusaders can't equate all medical cannabis use with combustion, although it's more suitable for your agenda.

8450 2018-02-16 19:37:08 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
8451 2018-02-16 19:37:05 "but we need oil!!!!!!!! That's the only way we can create jobs!!!!!!! Polluting forms of energy production-- that's it!!!!!!"
8452 2018-02-16 19:37:02 Coconut Oil followed by a gentle facial cleanser (right now Milky Jelly Cleanser)
8453 2018-02-16 19:36:56 So apparently you can now buy cannabis oil from Holland & Barrett..
8454 2018-02-16 19:36:54 180247 193650 || ٣٤٥- The oil down the desert way
8455 2018-02-16 19:36:54 Ah come on Senator,  we all know that @cnn is to real news what used car oil is to clean hands. They just don’t go together !!!! #fakenews
8456 2018-02-16 19:36:46 i remember that a while ago i wrote abt what wheatley thought of alcohol and it was basically that if he wanted to drink something that tasted like motor oil, he could just chug motor oil fjshsagvf
8457 2018-02-16 19:36:45 Still mystified that I can take my car to the dealer and get an oil change for about half the price of a Jiffy Lube. What the hell was I doing for all those years?
8458 2018-02-16 19:36:37 And the old game repeats, over&over again: The weakest get hit the hardest, at first. This world can be so depressing.... We could change a BIT at least, if we in the west would get education abt organic fair shopping & act accordingly, but in crisis as such.. Its abt Oil=Power
8459 2018-02-16 19:36:35 Saudia Arabia plans to invade Iran /Russia turkey takes the left flank invades Russia. China invade Syria iran Iraq for oil

8463 2018-02-16 19:36:02 If you identify as a man, take care of your testosterone!

-use products with parabens

DO:

8464 2018-02-16 19:35:57 Go back to teaching morals, right & wrong once again.
Go back to consistent discipline based on them.
Go back to history of country and function of government
Go back to straight foward mathmatics
Go back to straight foward biology
8465 2018-02-16 19:35:34 And now we can take down the evil wizards and warlocks in Big Pharma too. I have a federal action which claims the buds of the cannabis plant are crucial to the requirements of my faith in making the Holy oil of Christ. Christ commanded his disciples to anoint the sick. So we do.
8466 2018-02-16 19:35:29 I love everything coconut, I use coconut oil for everything, even conditioning my hair and coconut vinegar is wonderful in so many dishes! #FingersCrossed @emmajw11
8467 2018-02-16 19:35:25 Price of oil has crashed Venezuela. Ironically Chavez wasn't militant enough when he won his landslide elections. If he had totally nationalized the economy, Venezuela would not have had lockouts and collusion between businesses and US.
8468 2018-02-16 19:35:23 Wealth creation in Canada will come from other markets than base raw materials.  Yes we have internal issues with oil and gas transportation but Canada is way beyond that.
8469 2018-02-16 19:35:13 advice for the new artists:
1. never be afraid to start fresh  
2. dont let people hold u back
3. essential oil diffusers in the studio
8470 2018-02-16 19:35:11 Thar goes Oil coz why the fuck not
8471 2018-02-16 19:35:08 It thrust right up at pit close. So did this move FE? Arrows? Is this at risk of overshooting next week? The dollar isn't going down, so these may probably be the "buy the dip" morons.
8472 2018-02-16 19:35:03 Somebody tweeted that cat was jumping over the spot on the kitchen floor because they must've put anointing oil there and it was a demon

8477 2018-02-16 19:33:43 We are way beyond an oil and gas nation.  If your assessment is based on that i would agree that there are issues that need to be resolved.  what about the rest of the economy
8478 2018-02-16 19:33:39 I took my daughter to the game and my wife stayed home.  After the game, she said we have to do the same thing next Oil game.
8479 2018-02-16 19:33:37 Haha! Pure snake oil!
8480 2018-02-16 19:33:37 Haha! Pure snake oil.
8481 2018-02-16 19:33:35 Am I the only one that can't stand the smell of fried fish?  It has nothing to do with the oil used.  Sickening smell. 
8482 2018-02-16 19:33:34 Bro the chicken was so greasy it felt like I was getting an oil change. And the fries were super dry this time.  Popeyes >>>>> canes
8483 2018-02-16 19:33:03 My oil dripping metal pussy, weld it, forge it, smash it pussy
8484 2018-02-16 19:32:40 When comparing compete to teams like LV, Calgary, LA etc I’d say George is on to something. Oil have never had a strong level of heart in games over the last 10 seasons with the exception of last yr. That speaks to management and coaching.
8485 2018-02-16 19:32:35 Keep watching your "follower list" and follow them back.  I was having same problem.  Still have to keep an eye on the numbers!

8492 2018-02-16 19:31:20 vit e is a miracle oil
8493 2018-02-16 19:31:18 Currently at 96,000,000 barrels per day. You read it right. Half the planet’s population wants to escape abject poverty, and cheap, efficient energy is the only way. Hopefully by the time oil runs out in 200 years we’ll have mastered fusion energy.
8494 2018-02-16 19:31:18 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
8495 2018-02-16 19:31:18 Haha no... I'm sorry but there is pizza in this world where oil is f**king floating on the top. You just haven't been to a bad pizza place jet, lucky you!
8496 2018-02-16 19:30:57 Its all good! Im sure since the both of us are properly hydrated (ur Twitter tag) you probably cringe like I do when folks tell people to put coconut oil on their face. Its a pore clogging oil that does NOT work for everybody!Stay hydrated my friend!
8497 2018-02-16 19:30:49 That oil number is about to jump up, once the new fields in West Texas get going.  Has me thinking about returning to the Permian Basin, actually.
8498 2018-02-16 19:30:47 Mix 8 oz Guancamole with 2 cups bamboo shoots. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Fry. Serve for brunch
8499 2018-02-16 19:30:43 Spoons/cars are not intended to be used to make you obese or to be in an accident. Guns are made to kill (can be used for other things but are made to kill. This false equivalency only weakens your argument.  But I'd be all for banning oil tankers and move on to clean energy.  :)
8500 2018-02-16 19:30:40 OIL DIFF: 3.29 -> 3.39

8506 2018-02-16 19:30:09 i’m glad i put so much oil on my face this morning i’ve been in here woodworking for a few hours and my whole face feels tight so dry...
8507 2018-02-16 19:30:05 I've managed to eliminate palm oil completely from my life and feel a lot better for it.

8543 2018-02-16 19:25:12 There's millions of ton of coal under our feet, it's still there!
The costs of extraction will determine how much oil can be exploited.
Surely you have learnt over the past few years that it is a volatile commodity, not a stable base to build an economy on.
8544 2018-02-16 19:25:07 Book an oil change ahead of the long weekend. There's still time today.
8545 2018-02-16 19:25:06 I adore all sorts of art styles and mediums. Contemporary, pop, digitial/anime, fully graphite, oil, nouveau, etc... so weird when other artists tear down another medium because they think theirs is superior lol what

8551 2018-02-16 19:24:05 Add four handfuls of olive oil then bring to a boil.
8552 2018-02-16 19:24:00 If you’re going to play this game, why not expose all the lobbyists.  Pharmaceutical companies, oil companies, big tobacco and Wall St.  all have Congress in their back pocket.  If you do the math, they’re responsible for more deaths than guns.
8553 2018-02-16 19:23:59 Yet coal, natural gas and oil produce fifty times more energy. Employees is one of our biggest expenses. It is no wonder wind and solar are not cost effective.

8560 2018-02-16 19:22:57 There's so much automation in the extraction and processing of oil. Solar is essentially in the infrastructure expansion phase, which generates a ton of good blue-collar jobs.

Organically grown cannabis is hugely important for processors, because it eliminates the risk that a concentrated hash oil might fail a pesticide test that the original flower passed.

8604 2018-02-16 19:17:39 Got to be so careful when reading labels. If it has palm oil then back on the shelf it goes. I don't understand why it has to even be an "ingredient" at all? It disturbs me how far humans go, not only to destroy ourselves, but also everything beautiful around us. Terrible.

8606 2018-02-16 19:17:29 I feel mixing it into my foundation has just made whatever product I’m wearing sit really nicely on my skin. And as someone with combo skin, I get really intense dry areas sometimes but if I use the oil it goes away pretty quickly

8608 2018-02-16 19:17:17 Exxon already owns million of acres of oil fields in Russia that they are prevented by law from drilling. This has always been the main motivation. (See: Rex Tillerson.)
Also, to push a "white" ethno-agenda which he and Vlad just happen to agree on. 
Sigh....
8609 2018-02-16 19:17:12 Because we buy oil (which oil is made from) with dollars and from international companies.

8610 2018-02-16 19:17:06 If this is so concerning to you, look into the influence of big Banks, Oil, and Pharma on our policies.  Gun lobby acts on behalf of their members, from whom they get most of their funds (reg citizens).  I assure you, the other lobbies are not in it for the People.

[1]And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
8651 2018-02-16 19:12:55 “Hey weren’t you in...?!” “Yeah, I just need an oil change”
8652 2018-02-16 19:12:39 And say, "The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills -  let him believe; and whoever wills -  let him disbelieve." Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like murky oil,
8653 2018-02-16 19:12:31 Jesus was anointed with the oil of joy yet was acquainted with grief and a man of sorrows. Let that sink in.

8656 2018-02-16 19:12:10 But then the oil & electric companies or wouldn’t get their money.

8658 2018-02-16 19:11:48 Oil was the backing in the petrodollar paradigm. But that is coming to an end. China to introduce the petroyuan next month. Countries are rejecting the dollar for oil. The world is changing. Inflation's about to pick up steem.
8659 2018-02-16 19:11:37 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
8660 2018-02-16 19:11:30 21, it was an eternity!!

meanwhile Hux is eagerly awiting the invention of lube. olive oil only gets you so far.
8661 2018-02-16 19:11:20 Because he, Vladimir & Exxon got a deal to get trillions in oil outta Russia......and ya know it.
8662 2018-02-16 19:11:19 Trying to collect so called "Oil" to push in somewhere...
8663 2018-02-16 19:11:03 Liz Earle is giving away my favourite facial oil with the cleanse and polish 3 step set. Time to go back.
8664 2018-02-16 19:10:58 I make a Greek/Mediterranean version of tuna salad with green olives, chopped lettuce, chopped tomato, diced onion, olive oil, and a bit of the brine from the olives. Yummy.

8666 2018-02-16 19:10:50 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
8667 2018-02-16 19:10:49 Oil cleanser!
8668 2018-02-16 19:10:48 When people make their photos super blury/ with that weird 3D oil slick effect

Sorry i dont speak teen edge
8669 2018-02-16 19:10:36 Poor @scottpruittok can't fly w/regular Americans because he might hear them discuss what it's like to not only never be able to afford 1st class, but to also discuss the @EPA decisions to allow pollution, roll back regulations on clean air/water, side w/big oil, block science
8670 2018-02-16 19:10:25 I guess you are right about jobs. The State of Alaska and the town of Valdez continue to employee people cleaning up after that oil spill in 1989. So keep Canada working on oil spill clean ups should be your slogan.
8671 2018-02-16 19:10:22 St Mary's Way, Pyramid roundabout are the main ones, Woodford/Chester Road by the Oil Depot, Otterspool to Romiley just before the Spread Eagle, High Lane A6 the list goes on and on #shambles

8676 2018-02-16 19:10:01 oilers gonna oil... I love it after all the chirping by the fanbase and the fawning by the media

8678 2018-02-16 19:09:57 i want a really nice oil burner but i dont wanna pay for it
8679 2018-02-16 19:09:55 Soon it will be carrying oil FROM the arctic - Tillerson and Sechin made  a US-Russian deal to drill the arctic oil together. The less, the more  oil, the more CO2, the less ice...Climate-Change reinforcing itself.
8680 2018-02-16 19:09:41 At least she's not jumping into politics to cash in on her celebrity and/or victim status.
8681 2018-02-16 19:09:39 honestly, probably all the oil and sugar in American style Chinese food
8682 2018-02-16 19:09:37 @BizCouncilBC please explain why BC needs another pipeline brought in from Alberta? How does that benefit BC when the oil is being shipped to Asia to be refined? Who paid you off to say such things like you speak for British Columbians
8683 2018-02-16 19:09:21 cotton pad with cleansing water first and then an oil cleanser before foam
8684 2018-02-16 19:09:11 I used coconut oil or skin drink from lush
8685 2018-02-16 19:08:52 Yikes! I remember for about a week in 1998 gas prices were .99 a gallon. I guess no matter how much oil we have, we'll never see that price again. Wishful thinking on my part.
8686 2018-02-16 19:08:51 That moment when you realise that the world hasn't really changed. The terrorists of my youth are a bit different. The oil crisis of my youth are a bit different. The migrants of my youth are a bit different. /1
8687 2018-02-16 19:08:51 What horrible thing have you done that is just about to be exposed? Their is the oil co's playbook. PR offensive before exposure of misdeeds.
8688 2018-02-16 19:08:47 There’re no friends but forgot that that the reason, stayed here all black with eyes oogying with eyes oogying with oil.
8689 2018-02-16 19:08:24 They need to allow medical marijuana! I don’t want to smoke it I want FECO oil for my lungs!
8690 2018-02-16 19:08:24 Everytime I get my oil changed the man who does it yells at me for coming in so late to get it done 
8691 2018-02-16 19:08:13 Dr Savage, I take CBD oil from the hemp plant. Is that just as bad as regular marijuana with the in it. The CBD has little to no thc in it. Maybe talk about it on today's show?
8692 2018-02-16 19:07:38 The 70s sucked. All I think of is oil crisis, disco, stagflation, watergate, terrible architecture/cars/fashion/design everything sucked
8693 2018-02-16 19:07:26 Waiting for an oil change to be done i done went and bought a new bathroom set and bedroom set lol
8694 2018-02-16 19:07:12 when will tiny SK learn that not everyone in Cda (except AB) cares about oil?
8695 2018-02-16 19:07:10 Took my car to get an oil change today and god damn I love watching it drive away  never realized how fucking loud it is though
8696 2018-02-16 19:07:04 Incorrect info in your tweet: this is oil on canvas
8697 2018-02-16 19:07:02 I had rotisserie chicken today w a dipping sauce that was basically chicken drippings, browned garlic and olive oil? Recommended
8698 2018-02-16 19:06:58 I forgot to mention, add a few drops of olive oil. Turmeric apparently absorbs better when you ingest it with fat to help speed up your recovery
8699 2018-02-16 19:06:54 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over
8700 2018-02-16 19:06:41 @YourAlberta you guys are pathetic. What Canadian jobs are supported by allowing oil to be shipped to Asia unrefined?
8701 2018-02-16 19:06:39 So what will happen to my car if I don’t change the oil when my sticker from the last oil change tells me to
8702 2018-02-16 19:06:21 Sounds like your skin is loving all that softening jojoba oil!

8705 2018-02-16 19:05:49 Idk how people like driving so much I’m on the road this weekend and next weekend . Guess I’ll get this raggedy oil change next week lmao
8706 2018-02-16 19:05:47 Could see the Oil liking Shaw, at least.
8707 2018-02-16 19:05:44 I see you Trey, sliding that half off on my oil change
8708 2018-02-16 19:05:20 Here's a list of things I live literally right next to: a horse pasture, a freeway, a train track, a oil refinery that shoots air cannons that sound like gunshots to scare birds and also sounds an alarm like a nuclear bomb alert every Friday at noon. All. At. The. Same. Time.
8709 2018-02-16 19:05:17 It is what it is. We're fortunate that we can pay out of pocket. Still, its telling that the markup is so significant. Just imagine if we used car insurance to buy gas, tires and oil changes...
8710 2018-02-16 19:05:08 tbh a nice lil spritz of some peppermint essential oil in the shower can do wonders! also def not throwing shade on ppl who genuinely need a bath n need to be surrounded by nice warm water to feel relaxed. Talkin bout ppl who take baths every day just to take baths
8711 2018-02-16 19:04:56 Oil price drop was due to OPEC members Saudi Arabia & UAE refused to cut production, also strong dollar at the time, SFA to do with US Fracking cost of same was $60 to $100, probably why Saudi & UAE kept up production.Forecasts are price will settle around $75
8712 2018-02-16 19:04:55 my rose hip oil and vape juice bottle look the same I ALMOST PUT VAPE JUICE IN MY FACE
8713 2018-02-16 19:04:47 Obama approved oil drilling there twice, did you know that? Course in order to frack one must melt ice I suppose
8714 2018-02-16 19:04:42 Helps track circuit continuity (ensures the train doesn’t disappear from the signallers screen. Used in areas where track can be easily contaminated, oil / grease / debris.
8715 2018-02-16 19:04:37 I have never seen so many ANC MPs so tense they were like opposition today. Opposition was cheering and very happy but them like they have just swallowed castor oil. It was bad people worried abt their jobs others about jail.
8716 2018-02-16 19:04:33 The cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is estimated at over $61 billion. That is a huge threat to the BC economy. When will Alberta and Ottawa guarantee full economic responsibility for all costs for BC spills of Alberta oil?
8717 2018-02-16 19:04:31 It's all I've got after a spectacular #GroceryFail to accompany Dover sole with brown shrimp/parsley butter and grilled potatoes .........  Think steamed & dressed with lemon oil, garlic and chilli flakes might be OK.  We'll see!
8718 2018-02-16 19:04:15 Wiping grit off my cheek, and then realize I put turmeric and coconut oil on my face!
8719 2018-02-16 19:04:07 Having a great day, boss let me finish early and everything. But now I’ve put water in the oil tank of my car, and if I drive it, it might blow up! I FUCKING HATE CARS.
8720 2018-02-16 19:04:03 sitting in the lobby waiting to get my oil changed was not a good place for me to watch drakes new video 
8721 2018-02-16 19:03:34 Her car is back in the shop they had supposedly fixed her oil leak
8722 2018-02-16 19:03:21 Sorry its haram...

8736 2018-02-16 19:01:37 Nasrallah's assertion today that the Lebanese state should use Hizbullah in its oil & gas dispute w/Israel reveals how the western political science discipline fails to account for such a unique relationship; instead of a state/non-state binary there's a complementarity of roles

8741 2018-02-16 19:01:21 Omg, it's a shale gas, pipeline, and oil drilling moratoriums. Not complicated or even controversial.
8742 2018-02-16 19:01:21 Why are olives the only virgins of the oil industry? You think I want slutty vegetable oil? Extra fuckable canola oil, aisle 6.

8744 2018-02-16 19:00:43 I'm saying we're a society with laws intended to keep each other safe, enabling us to pursue liberty and happiness because we're still alive.

8759 2018-02-16 18:58:53 Not sure where you're headed with that one...I happen to like horses.  My point is that global oil consumption is increasing every year, with no peak in sight...yet people blame producers who are simply meeting that demand.  Why?  Why not target consumers?

8770 2018-02-16 18:56:42 Maybe because they are white? You’re proving my point. Also, Ireland never had the minerals, diamonds, gold and oil Africa does. There is a lot of incentive for whites to continue to destabilize it if they can’t outright control it.
8771 2018-02-16 18:56:33 The only ridicule should be towards ourselves. Blocking the egress for both oil and LNG has allowed other markets to bypass and prosper. Meanwhile we sit on the sidelines, debt levels rising, taxes increasing, social programs cut. This is acceptable? No.

Sanctions on Venezuela have died up their reserve currencies(USD, EUR, GBP). gullible westerners will line up to give him their stable currencies in exchange for his petrodollars. Venezuela has large oil reserves. Oil is over of the most liquid commodities

8810 2018-02-16 18:51:05 Is there a prompt or pre written letter we consumers can send via email to companies that are not using sustainable palm oil? Or to urge them to take palm oil out of their products completely? Something we can copy and paste, maybe?
8811 2018-02-16 18:50:40 A9.2 Another option is to replace oil with water and steam. Also, cooking as a family helps us to plan better options. #FoodFri

8820 2018-02-16 18:49:38 this is very true. BUT we also need to acknowledge that a lot of the global problems are caused by our action (was hearing about demise of orangutans in Borneo coz we use palm oil in household products)
8821 2018-02-16 18:49:36 Geoffrey Batt: After 2003, most Iraqis don't feel they have a stake in the system. True of Shia as well as Sunnis & minorities. Need to look for tools that rebuild a sense of having a stake, such as oil dividend.

8881 2018-02-16 18:42:21 Some needs to ask why, in today's modern age with digital communication, do all of those that oppose oil need to fly places to make themselves heard?  It does seem a bit hypocritical.  If they truly think oil is bad and we shouldn't be using it, then why aren't they doing it.
8882 2018-02-16 18:42:04 Even w/ these operatives we are hemming up its not even a big deal to them unless the U. S wants true static (war).  Guarantee this is retribution for locking up oil in the middle east and then raising the price on them

8925 2018-02-16 18:35:28 And profits from our taxes and most-expensive rip-off fares, sent abroad to support their pension schemes. Just imagine our national pension pot if all utilities and natural gas/oil were kept in public ownership.

8933 2018-02-16 18:33:50 The fact y’all don’t understand why people would be questioning an oil refining in GB is kind of crazy and shortsighted.

8969 2018-02-16 18:27:06 I agree.  He's like a cardboard cutout of politician/snake oil salesman.  The kind that will smile and promise the world while he's stabbing you in the back.  We don't need anymore of his kind. We need real people in office, not politicians.
8970 2018-02-16 18:26:50 No.  I’m saying you are not always in control of your personal circumstances. The recent downturn in the oil industry resulted in thousands of redundancies in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. That was a result of a pissing contest between the USA and OPEC.  Who controls that ????

9057 2018-02-16 18:16:50 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

9067 2018-02-16 18:16:05 So I guess Suzuki fuels his plane, vehicles on hypocrisy? Suzuki the man who talks to rivers and waterways that serve as the mode of transport for Saudi Oil to fulfill the energy requirements because Canada prefers to import anti-female oil over Cdn Oil industry employing women
9068 2018-02-16 18:16:01 Are you serious? 4 people in trump Campaign indicted and now 13 Russians that posed as US persons with proven contact with Trump campaign. Get your head out of your ass. Oh and don’t forget that THREE people that worked for Trump have pleaded guilty. What planet do you live on?

9070 2018-02-16 18:15:57 We're up 7 oil rigs overall, but down 4 in the Permian. I guess the Permian news isn't great news, but 7 overall up is great news. AND it may not matter as US oil production has gotten more efficient :)

9080 2018-02-16 18:15:03 We can classify the paintings in two groups latex and oil based paints. The latex paint has a water base and an excellent ability to hold surfaces, its colors are intense and are better preserved besides they give off very little odor and can be cleaned only with soap and water
9081 2018-02-16 18:15:02 Tea tree oil is rough on me. Used the shampoo and my head burned all day. I guess the bath must dilute it enough.
9082 2018-02-16 18:14:52 @NestleUSA try getting out of the conflict palm oil and selling off water from drought devastated areas of the US and then maybe we will believe you are doing something good.

9100 2018-02-16 18:12:39 Understand the fall, crush more for meal get the extra oil domestically, part of me thinks overdone because argy is also the largest oil exporter, so if the demand is still their the price will catch up. Global oil S&D is heavy though
9101 2018-02-16 18:12:38 Do you mean like Reince Priebus, who helped turn the GOP over to a snake oil salesman?  Or do you mean like Ron Johnson, who insinuates that the FBI has a secret cabal trying to bring down the snake oil salesman?
9102 2018-02-16 18:12:16 Most were anticipating much higher ; no reason at all for oil to go down on rig count. Another month or so from now North Dakota starts dropping for spring break-up.

9104 2018-02-16 18:12:01 There are some great lower maintenance options with internally geared hubs (so the rear gears are all fully encased) and lower maintenance still with belt drive, which has no chain or oil. They're more pricey of course, but good fun.

9107 2018-02-16 18:11:45 I'd argue its the most honest admin in awhile. Instead of appointing a politician who's bought by big oil, he just appoints the head of Exxon. He said he wanted to dismantle the government, that's what he's doing.
9108 2018-02-16 18:11:24 Hmmmm, what are you saying?

Iraq's proven oil reserves to production ration is 140+ years. It produces over 4mln bpd.. sits on over 130bln oil barrels..& has massive undiscovered oil wealth
9179 2018-02-16 18:03:00 That doesn't sound much given that the global gdp combined is more than 100 trillion. Hope the oil price starts rising soon so renewables have a price advantage over oil.

9218 2018-02-16 17:59:00 People don’t like coconut oil but it works for some people. I only use it for taking off my makeup and detangling my hair. I can’t use it as a moisturizer.

9228 2018-02-16 17:57:40 According to this article it would cut of Venezuelas main source of income. Oil makes up 95% of its exported goods. So is it extra income or by most means their only income?

As more crude is produced through shale & new oil rigs, gas prices will continue to fall. No more control by OPEC

I believe you that it's preservative free. But do you even know what a chemical is? Everything, including your beard oil, is full of chemicals. Even water is a chemical.
9267 2018-02-16 17:52:04 Maybe because Trudeau is more interested in green energy rather than polluting the land with more oil spills? You want to talk about respecting the natural resources? The party that removed protections from 99.9% of all Canada's wetlands? #Hypocrites

The science is very clear: if we keep on the same path, putting massive quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere, the outcome will be catastrophic.

9315 2018-02-16 17:45:32 Vast majority of those subsidies are in developing countries, and are CONSUMER subsidies, not to the producers.

Shale prods & oil rigs will will make US energy independent this year. OPEC will crumble late next year. Prices will fall,

9352 2018-02-16 17:41:03 Do you people even know liquid Crude will not even burn and it has to be heated to about 1200 degrees to turn it to a gas. Do you know it's used in petroleum jelly, makeup base? That it's not a tar based oil, has noting it above the levels accepted in the clean water act?
9353 2018-02-16 17:40:36 War now means Power, control  oil $$$$$$$$$$$&&$$$$$$. Our children are paying a high price.

9357 2018-02-16 17:40:13 The decline of Rome, and lead poisoning, all over again. Rural America, the land and its people, are being poisoned by the few industries that keep them in existence - Coal, Oil, Farming, etc. It is a toxic parasitic relationship which destroys the host, because Biz doesn’t care.
9358 2018-02-16 17:40:11 Ok y'all act like this is new. Corporatocracy is fascism. Big Ag, Big Pharma, Big Oil, Citizens United? Ring a bell? Money in politics corrupts. Until we deal with the issue, this is the result. Politicians will vote their funders will.

9361 2018-02-16 17:39:41 The gun industry (or Koch's, coal, fracking, oil, insurance, etc) dump millions into these Republican shills, and make it back 10 fold as consumer protections are eliminated. It's become the best ROI a company or oligarch can make... and We The People get to deal with the mess.
9362 2018-02-16 17:39:34 It's insanity. They are stopping offshore in NC even though Trump released the restrictions.  The reality is that transporting oil by tanker is far more dangerous than drilling off shore.  The Gulf is completely recovered from the worst spill on record.

9374 2018-02-16 17:36:26 Why did the Gov made this change when NO human or animal has been harmed by Sweet Penn Grade oil? Google it , do some lab work, use the science not hype and BS and stand on the facts to protect our businesses and lives for a change!
9375 2018-02-16 17:36:06 That’s not bad particularly the gdp growth...
It will be interesting to understand the Increase in exports of oil versus non oil though

9378 2018-02-16 17:35:18 Bots and trolls already coming out on this one ;), so I take that as a good sign. When you air the truth they get freaky and try to shut it down. Let's remember that TrumPutin's wet dream is surfing a tidal wave of new oil profits.
9379 2018-02-16 17:35:14 And continuing high oil revenues, which have not materialised.

9389 2018-02-16 17:34:17 Why do oil changes take so long
9390 2018-02-16 17:34:16 I should have just changed my oil myself.  @Walmart is taking forever.

What I'm basically saying is, gimme my ARCOM now
9395 2018-02-16 17:33:33 @EPAScottPruitt who should we trust thousands of climate science people or you the American public just laughs at you your just in the pocket of big oil and gas your not fooling anyone your just another trump puppet
9396 2018-02-16 17:33:29 Issue of one Nigeria is because of oil and gas in Biafra land
9397 2018-02-16 17:33:10 there’s the difference. once hispanics dominate a field which is identical to one that is dominated by white americans, one of them is “less”. people make jokes and discrimate hispanic kids whose parents work in agriculture while no one blinks an eye at white oil field workers
9398 2018-02-16 17:33:02 We need a real OIl and Gas assoc that protects us from regulations that are not based in fact or science! One that promotes solutions that a reasonable and sensible and have a fair risk /rewards value for everyone. The Gov just made a stupid and uncalled for 30 notice rule WRU?

9415 2018-02-16 17:31:24 Some girls at work told me olive oil is a great to use as a make up remover 

Idk if they were looking out or if I’m about to blind myself 

Will keep you posted
9416 2018-02-16 17:31:22 You guys have done your research on Bush and 911 right?
You know how they lied 2 Congress to invade Iraq, D. Cheney made 50 billion in oil.
They changed law so NORAD couldn't scramble jets. Admitted 2 losing TRILLIONS then blew up Pentagon
Bush kicked all this off praised OBAMA!
9417 2018-02-16 17:31:21 How have they been impacted by low oil & gas production.
9418 2018-02-16 17:31:05 Totally overdue. Guns, gas and oil out of Washington.
9419 2018-02-16 17:30:46 OIL DIFF: 3.35 -> 3.43

9423 2018-02-16 17:30:07 A lot of long pauses and uncomfortable silences after Tillerson's specialty- oil deals. Do you suppose they got to the Turkish thugs squads Erdogan unleashed in the US.
9424 2018-02-16 17:30:01 Today herself has joined the grandchildren for a museum trip to Basingstoke. Oh, she’s very brave! I have settled for prepping my next painting, which I shall start next week. Another NY oil composition.
9425 2018-02-16 17:29:51 I hope whoever invented putting tea tree oil on the face is having a great day
9426 2018-02-16 17:29:43 You do not need to haul non hazardous Penn Grade crude to a landfill!! It has never harmed a human or animal that I can find and lab reports prove it. I have been totally covered in oil hundreds of times and ate it in front of ODNR and OEPA since 1980 when I did he lab testing!
9427 2018-02-16 17:29:23 Lmao lyrics
9428 2018-02-16 17:29:20 also mineral oil
9429 2018-02-16 17:29:06 Fortunately us islanders really do give a dam about our water and land based jobs & know dam well a oil pipe line or tanker accident will end thousands of those jobs & ruin the environment when the spill does happen. We don’t have are heads stuck up some oilcorporations arse.
9430 2018-02-16 17:29:01 better u beli yg wajib moisturizer, toner, cleansing oil, cleanser (face wash) and sunscreen
9431 2018-02-16 17:29:01 I wish this were true but the company's dollar liabilities/expenditures are unpredictable and prone to soar without warning. It imports it's vital fuel to sell at a loss, while it is a price taker on its crude oil. This analyst gives it a "sell" rating.
9432 2018-02-16 17:29:01 Think He Used Soap instead of Baby Oil!!
9433 2018-02-16 17:28:49 I need an oil change asap but I hate doing adult things
9434 2018-02-16 17:28:45 Add yogurt, rice, oatmeal, olive oil nuts and lentils and some fruits and this is basically my diet at home (not including restaurant meals).

9436 2018-02-16 17:28:38 @Chandlersoil the customer service we have received from yourselves has been nothing short of diabolical..... 3 different delivery dates have been quoted and as yet still no oil delivery. We didn’t even have a courtesy call to inform us.

9439 2018-02-16 17:28:30 Because, you know, @realDonaldTrump knows class and all, what with the gold toilets and oil portraits of himself.

9441 2018-02-16 17:28:22 They tried to get me to do my oil and I was like pause..That’s what dads are for lol
9442 2018-02-16 17:28:15 Yes we do have a racist and sexist country unfortunately . But there are also decent people really hurting and willing to vote for anyone for change . Bernie would have had a lot of their votes, instead they got the snake oil salesman . And we will all pay for it.

9445 2018-02-16 17:27:51 I suspect Kurdish oil was one of the topics of the discussion.
9446 2018-02-16 17:27:49 There are actually quite a few “white Americans” in the oil fields. And it isn’t looked down upon at all, responsible adults will do anything to feed their families.
9447 2018-02-16 17:27:46 
9448 2018-02-16 17:27:40 idk but i really suggest simple/HL cleansing oil than senka, biore and else sorry

9450 2018-02-16 17:27:13 Yeah yeah, ethanol production requires lots of petroleum. Trying to prop up oil and gas in its stead? No thanks. When even my Trump-loving neighbor bought an electric mower, I knew the end of oil era was nigh.

9486 2018-02-16 17:21:42 Also it can be a gateway project to developing greater PHC, with PHC as a hub for oil services many coys will want to keep staff & clients close to the airport. Also he doesn't have to redevelop, he can sell.
9487 2018-02-16 17:21:37 It's Hot oil up those white Legs
9488 2018-02-16 17:21:32 Works van has just pissed all its oil everywhere. Breakdown will be about 3 hours. Happy Friday everyone.
9489 2018-02-16 17:21:27 Before that, thank you so much to my favourite argan oil make up remover (wet tissues) for making my life easierrrr. 
9490 2018-02-16 17:21:23 The money paid came from the very people he hurts. Even if you disagree with "oil" it's in very bad taste at the very least. Very Un-Canadian.
9491 2018-02-16 17:21:04 I do think I had the one with the more clear potion/oil timers/counts though too :)
9492 2018-02-16 17:20:56 coconut oil is different you big baby you just used it to get your makeup off and then washed it right off
9493 2018-02-16 17:20:51 My plans for the evening include a bubble bath, glam glow face mask, ocean sounds, my oil diffuser, and a bottle of wine.
9494 2018-02-16 17:20:51 Listening to @cbcradio report on 300,000+ abandoned AB oil sites with no remediation plan. Developers went bankrupt and there was never a contingency deposit held in escrow to cover clean-up. #ABpoli #BCpoli
9495 2018-02-16 17:20:35 I second this. Even Jesse Beirwagen changes his own oil
9496 2018-02-16 17:20:31 Tillerson pulls a bottle of 30-yr old single malt crude oil out of his ten gallon hat. “Erdy, lets you and me wet our whistles” Erdogan aides panic but Tillerson produces matching Brookstone glasses. “Giddyup” says Erdogan. The two take turns shooting a pistol at ceiling light.
9497 2018-02-16 17:20:22 Remember to toss your Tofurkey gently.  This is the best part!  To finish, add olive oil to your chia seeds.  Yum!
9498 2018-02-16 17:20:07 Or medium oil that is not being bought because of diamond pipeline
9499 2018-02-16 17:20:04 being contractor in oil company and working under there supervision is mean you are my slave for these assholes
9500 2018-02-16 17:19:54 You go into Car X for an oil change and walk out with a list of problems about your car they decided to write down on a piece of paper for you.
9501 2018-02-16 17:19:20 خليه يوقف دعم الارهابيين من عندوه في الاول... بعديها الدنيا رح تمشي تمام !!!
9502 2018-02-16 17:19:16 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
9503 2018-02-16 17:19:12 I honestly don't know. My guess is something like a timing chain or guide is loose and smacked it once. It had no oil in it (but it wasn't here for that) and was rattling to beat all (wasn't here for that either).

9507 2018-02-16 17:18:41 Export issues are very very bad for US oil & gas. Would be perfect if Trump kneecapped the frackers.
9508 2018-02-16 17:18:40 Our scientists have superseded themselves. We don’t need oil company funding or involvement in society’s future. Their employment is destructive to our biological systems. We need to reduce chemical application and let nature take back her course.
9509 2018-02-16 17:18:25 Just had my car oil changed and it went through the car wash. Looking good!
9510 2018-02-16 17:18:18 I need an oil change
9511 2018-02-16 17:18:02 Is Amy Schumer actually braw?, or is she ugly and pretending to be braw or what?, I dinnae get it cause she's nae oil painting
9512 2018-02-16 17:17:54 That's good news. The Saudi,Israeli Zionist plot to collapse the Venezuelan Economy and Gov by dumping dirty cheap oil on the market failed and backfired on the Saudi's own cash reserves and drained their Oil Reserves as well.
9513 2018-02-16 17:17:54 i should donate my senior self protrait to the museum of bad art. it’s sporadically rainbow, done with oil paint with too much medium, has no composition, and i used only a palette knife to paint it bc i wanted a lot of texture. it’s at my parents’ house i wish i had a picture

9515 2018-02-16 17:17:47 I love how Changmin uses EXTRA VIRGIN olive oil. Cuz yknow virgin ain’t enough it has to be EXTRA! 
9516 2018-02-16 17:17:43 Natural gas, oil, and wood remain more popular then electric heating or heat pumps in much of US
9517 2018-02-16 17:17:41 I do wish @tedgioia had been with us in Canada, @jwilson1812. Remember? We had lined up that big-fish investor for the Klondike Oil score, the idiot who thought he knew jazz? If Ted had been along to chat him up, he might not have pulled out of the deal at the last minute.
9518 2018-02-16 17:17:18 Pruitt is one of Trump's so called Chief's and all he had done is to take American Indian Lands, let Big Oil Company drill in our Parks and places that are not to be used for it, But we have Rex Tillerson who broke sanction laws with Russia helping him distroy our country
9519 2018-02-16 17:16:49 Clean oil and low heat. @Chunks9670
9520 2018-02-16 17:16:40 Staying away from MCT oil today. #lessonlearned
9521 2018-02-16 17:16:39 tea tree oil is good for itchy dread scalp! i used that Shit all the time. and peppermint oil to keep it feeling and smelling fresh
9522 2018-02-16 17:16:34 Try it! Sliver them and then sauté with olive oil and a little black pepper. I also added some chopped jalapeños.
9523 2018-02-16 17:16:31 4 of those cities on your list are in Texas. When you do your “comparative analysis” do you take resource rich revenues into account? Should we be drilling for oil?
9524 2018-02-16 17:16:30 What brand is that Essential Oil?
9525 2018-02-16 17:16:29 Ifu's nose be shining with the extra oil applied on it #BBNaija
9526 2018-02-16 17:16:21 And big Pharma.& big oil.& Wall Street. Individual contributions only with strict limits & full disclosure.
9527 2018-02-16 17:16:20 #CCS never made any sense to me, except for enhanced oil recovery (extraction of residual oil with supercritical CO2)....which is not CCS by definition. At #carbofex we will capture 350 kg of CO2 / MWh (of district heat generated) in #biochar at no extra cost or hassle
9528 2018-02-16 17:16:13 そうだ！1位になったらなんかあるらしいからな！
9529 2018-02-16 17:16:09 He's scum.  Owed and operated  by big oil.  Go back to Oklahoma.

9533 2018-02-16 17:15:54 Welcome gorgeous
9534 2018-02-16 17:15:43 Welcome banana lol
9535 2018-02-16 17:15:29 Yeah, that would tend to make discussions “tough” - oil company bozo sans translators or knowledgeable aides.
9536 2018-02-16 17:15:20 Rapeseed oil in a lot. A lot of ppl say ok? I am confused. I avoid sunflower. Palm oil is safe! What abt veg oil made from palm & rapeseed??
9537 2018-02-16 17:15:16 Who needs oil company money anyway?
9538 2018-02-16 17:15:08 Today’s News OnVenezuela, Feb 16-> Maduro warns Trump not to ban Venezuelan oil / More news… >>> Voluntad Popular will not participate in april presidential election<<<<

A: Stop ruining the environment or
B: Continue giving Air, Earth & Water away for Oil, Gas and Coal interests. Also lose whatever cash they've slipped into your coffers for years.
9540 2018-02-16 17:14:59 Car is getting an oil change, getting my hair/nails done. My one day off in three weeks. And I’m loving it.
9541 2018-02-16 17:14:49 That’s the main reason. They had the biggest oil reserves in the world and it was spend, spend spend. Nothing saved for the future. Sound familiar?
9542 2018-02-16 17:14:46 Spotify but i don't think another time i get castor oil for worldbuilding omg way cool! wow my LRT is so much that i held
9543 2018-02-16 17:14:34 “According to just-released data from the ... (TXOGA), the Texas oil and natural gas industry paid $9.4 billion in state and local taxes and state royalties in fiscal year 2016, the equivalent of $26 million a day to state and local revenue.” We need to find oil.
9544 2018-02-16 17:14:31 i wanna get that bahi sunflower oil but that shits like 20 dollars for a teaspoon
9545 2018-02-16 17:14:26 Policy can be junked but progress can’t be stopped. Adoption of technologies which eases pollution troubles, oil import bills and gives comfort to consumers in general do not always need to be policy dependant. EV wave is coming to the shores, and it’s a matter of “when” not “if”
9546 2018-02-16 17:14:13 I just put a little bit of essential oil on mine. Does just fine for me.
9547 2018-02-16 17:14:00 It's coconut oil, you waste of skin.
9548 2018-02-16 17:13:43 American oil should benefit Americans with lower prices period. @POTUS Fuel prices our killing our family budgets. We live rural and travel a lot farther to stores Etc.

9550 2018-02-16 17:13:06 Despite the pick-up mid-week, sector activity ended negative. The industrial index was down 1.07% w/w (-0.17% d/d) on the back of losses in DANGCEM (-2.55% w/w) and CAP (-9.27% w/w). The oil & gas index followed, sliding -1.05% w/w (flat on the day), depressed by FO (-6.64% w/w),

9552 2018-02-16 17:13:03 Traders' Market Update: Bitcoin, EUR/USD, Gold, WTI; DAX 30: EURUSD is bullish, but the price is also short-term overbought. Bitcoin keeps on adding to its gains following the end of the downtrend two days ago. In the last 24 hours, crude oil prices bounced… #forex #EURUSD
9553 2018-02-16 17:13:01 Every day after the European close, oil futures get jacked up most likely by an algo. Been happening for the past 2-3 days; exact same thing was happening a few weeks ago for several days in a row when oil made the run to 66. Not sure what the aim of the algo is.
9554 2018-02-16 17:13:00 Got that #FridayFeeling? Use NeoStrata Refine Oil Control Gel for a velvet matte finish that is perfectly prepped for your make-up
9555 2018-02-16 17:12:59 or make a sugar scrub by mixing coconut oil and sugar and use a toothbrush to apply it, takes off the chapped shit and then just use a lip balm, I like burts bees pomegranate lip balm or just some blistex in the case that your masculinity is fragile

9558 2018-02-16 17:12:05 Perfect article. Does Japan and S. Korea included in Asia category in your report? 
And how much oil according to your estimates flows to Asian non OECD countries?

9562 2018-02-16 17:11:23 @gg0U812 Saw another pet peeve on my way to get an oil change this morning: leaf blowers. They may have some useful purposes, but blowing crap into the street is not one of them! 
9563 2018-02-16 17:11:19 meanwhile zhirnovsky just admitted publicly that 300 bodies came back from the wagner shootout with US in Syria.. must of been over a kurdish oil field of some type, but daamn.. are we in hot war yet?

9568 2018-02-16 17:10:09 Whatever, our war wasn't about defending people but access to oil deposits
9569 2018-02-16 17:10:04 true but not oil stks.
9570 2018-02-16 17:09:52 #Trump The cost of producing US oil is approaching $20/bl. In the Middle East it is from $5-$10/bl. It is time to put the screws to Russian and Middle Eastern producers. Bring the price down. China would join us.

9577 2018-02-16 17:08:46 "Average annual GDP growth: 5.2%"
"Change in exports: 62% increase" 
- Would be interesting to know non oil sector % growth on these two parameters.
9578 2018-02-16 17:08:41 Yeah, you won't read them anywhere else because no one else would be stupid enough to believe them. But you keep selling your snake oil. Everyone has to make a living.
9579 2018-02-16 17:08:17 This is exactly what the NFL did with brain injuries for years and before that what tobacco industry did with smoking and of course oil and climate change. Enough is enough.
9580 2018-02-16 17:08:08 His spouse is still selling snake oil to easily impressionable stunned liberal progressive students and associated scum up in Canadistan. Madman Trudeau has made a refuge for all things and people anti-social hate-mongering pro-Islamist and the more anti-American the better.
9581 2018-02-16 17:07:53 Getting an oil change then maybe a new phone?
9582 2018-02-16 17:07:51 I just went and got my oil changed before work, because the special is 8-12 for 26.99 oil change.. As I'm pulling out of the parking lot I read the sign it's Monday throlu Thursday only, so I'm late for work for literally no reason..this is my life

9586 2018-02-16 17:07:45 I'm talking of players like Eike Immel, Maurizio Gaudino, Bert Trautmann, Michael Tarnat etc... players who were there before oil money. 

United are just the English Milan. Total flop since Ferguson retired. Nowhere near Real Madrid, Bayern München or Barcelona level.

9594 2018-02-16 17:07:09 lemme spend my lunch getting my oil changed 
9595 2018-02-16 17:06:40 Leftists are suspicious of big oil, big pharma, etc. The two "big" things they never question are: (1) big government, and (2) big baby-murder, that is Planned Parenthood. #obvious #pathetic
9596 2018-02-16 17:06:37 Im saying if theres fire, dont grab the oil can even if theres water in the can.

9626 2018-02-16 17:02:53 #egglets Don't waste your money! They don't tell you that after you wait a month to get them, you have to oil the inside before you can boil an egg each time. Also the recipe book is not much bigger than a book of stamps! Not like in the ad.

9628 2018-02-16 17:02:46 In 2015 there was a bunker fuel spill 1/100th the side of a potential tanker spill and it took over 2 days to for them to mobilize a response.
As we saw with Exxon Valdez, BP Gulf, etc. Risk is minimal - until it happens.
At the very least they could refine the oil first...

9636 2018-02-16 17:01:54 And they can spend their salaries however they wish, including brining in David Suzuki. Realistically, all of our paycheques in Alberta are dependent to some extent on wealth generated by oil. That doesn't mean we can't imagine a better future-- not hypocritical to do so.
9637 2018-02-16 17:01:33 End of the petro $ will either cause war or bankrupt US totally & stop the damn oil wars.
9638 2018-02-16 17:01:15 Also, if people were really environmentally committed, they'd want oil produced under the strictest regulations possible, which means California.  But usually they're just NIMBYs who are happy to import 1 million barrels a day into CA from places like Saudi Arabia
9639 2018-02-16 17:01:08 Do you get your oil changed at Oil N Go? Now you can give back while you wait! Stop by our Valparaiso Club and pick up a Super Saver card and every time you get your oil changed, Oil N Go gives back 10% to the Clubs and you receive 10% off!

9643 2018-02-16 17:00:55 I remember when I didn't know shit about cars. Now I can literally tell just by sound if you have no oil in your car, if you need a new belt, or if your power steering is going out. 
9644 2018-02-16 17:00:41 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
9645 2018-02-16 17:00:36 Clearly we need to leap away from the kind of leadership that is beholden to big oil & makes empty promises. Have you actually read the Leap manifesto Minister?  What part is divisive?

9654 2018-02-16 16:59:01 The foundation is tricky to get used to, but I only recommend it if you like a heavy-duty, hella thick coverage. Work quickly with it (bc it can dry v fast) and use a damp beauty blender. I also use a couple drops of argan oil for a dewy finish and to help it blend :')

9659 2018-02-16 16:58:38 It would be nice if all the tax $$$ generated from oil and gas companies and workers were NEVER USED to pay for teachers salaries. Hmm I wonder how that would work....
9660 2018-02-16 16:58:20 Assuming we had 100% commitment to fighting global warming in the US, we're still going to need oil and gas for a period of time (forever actually, but let's say a number of years in it's current quantity of use).  Do you want it coming from overseas on ship, or local?
9661 2018-02-16 16:58:03 @Battlefield is there an issue with the blood and sand mission as I've done oil of empire twice and still showing zero score when I've scored enough both times? Xbox one

9668 2018-02-16 16:57:37 Hi-lo Tostinos.  Apparently if a white hipster makes it in a bougie East Coast city neighborhood, they become chic. Mac & cheese, quinoa, kale, donuts, pierogies, hot dogs, fries, hamburgers, turmeric milk, coconut oil...

9671 2018-02-16 16:57:30 I could agree with David's view, but I think this consequence of the rise of nationalism is not so clear in countries without an abundance of fossil resources. Though low oil and gas prices might make this less relevant.

What do you think about it?

9674 2018-02-16 16:57:06 Yesterday we were hanging out with these people and one of the guys oil cartridge went missing. And me & jacquii were at the hotdog place down the street. HE RAN to the restaurant, came up to us and told me to empty out my purse

9677 2018-02-16 16:56:31 More propaganda! Hmm, just hearing about all the abandoned oil wells, some still leaking, because there's no money to clean them up. How about using some of your bs advertising money for that???
9678 2018-02-16 16:56:27 Suzuki is a HUGE hypocrite.  Big oil needs to expose his empty speeches that tote do as I say and not as I do.

Citizens on the hook for clean up when oil wells are abandoned...yes, 300,000 abandoned! Though fully aware of Albertan dystopia, PM Trudeau & R.Notley insist BC play this environmentally disastrous Russian roulette!
9686 2018-02-16 16:54:54 Oil spills
9687 2018-02-16 16:54:40 Agreed. We also used our glove box for electrochemistry in Larry Dahl's group. Reactions, chromatography, crystallization all done via Schlenk. And a high vacuum line (with a good old oil diffusion pump!) for sealing NMR tubes.
9688 2018-02-16 16:54:37 Oil aren’t getting Frederik or Senny or Celarik. It’s Vatarano or a 3/4 rd pick! But hey shoot for the moon if you want. Sweeney’s not PC and won’t be fleeced by him either.

9695 2018-02-16 16:54:01 Exactly! The pipeline issue isn't about oil to me; it's about making sure those workers don't lose their income because of their chosen profession.
9696 2018-02-16 16:53:46 All I know is Scotland is probably the most beautiful country in the world which offers free university, free OAP travel, free health care & prescriptions & free from fracking among other things. We pay taxes & wouldn't live anywhere else. Safe, secure & we've even got oil!

9698 2018-02-16 16:53:39 Chicken soup can help too because apparently there's something in the fat (not for coughing but secretions). Hot lemon and manuka honey. I used to also drink a small amount of apple cider vinegar and use oil of oregano but maybe not when breastfeeding??

9718 2018-02-16 16:51:46 @VelshiRuhle  the oil companies are required to maintain a disaster fund. Why not the NRA? Perhaps they would do more to limit the numbers, types of guns and ages they encourage gun ownership.
9719 2018-02-16 16:51:34 When I went to get my oil change the guy asked me for my name then he told me to repeat my last name for him because I said it so beautiful lmao thanks i love my last name too

9728 2018-02-16 16:50:38 @KySportsRadio you can use a glue trap, take the mouse where you want to release it and pour vegetable oil in the trap.  It'll help them escape the glue trap.  You might have to gently help it out though.
9729 2018-02-16 16:50:24 Huh. Random thing I just learned online: apparently mangoes are part of the same family as poison oak/ivy/etc. and the peels contain small amounts of the oil that causes reactions.
9730 2018-02-16 16:50:24 If this is unclear to your organization I can provide a number of links as proof that @ErnestMoniz is a paid lobbyist for big oil.
9731 2018-02-16 16:50:24 There already is a merit based immigration system in place.  Immigrants must have a high school diploma and a skill.  You chased out the alternative energy industries in the US to benefit oil based industries and destroyed them and the jobs that American had in them.
9732 2018-02-16 16:50:14 @bigotires I took my truck to your store on Mason ST in Fort Collins. I was there for an oil change, transmission fluids flush and change, winter special, tire rotation. I arrived at 7:45 and was second in line.  At 8:00 a young man checked me in and was professional and pleasant
9733 2018-02-16 16:50:13 Sounds like big oil in the late 60’s gas wars.  Sold gas at 10 cents a gallon to drive out all the mom/pop stations.  They sold at a loss all day long, but could absorb it.  When the full service stations died. Most of them.   Got hand slap and ‘bad dog’.
9734 2018-02-16 16:50:07 Wow! I cannot believe it has only been 6 weeks! What an incredible journey in Text, thanks to the wonderful @SonnieBeckett.

9737 2018-02-16 16:49:54 Will never happen. They have a right just like any other organization to donate to a cause. What really should happen is getting rid of lobbyists. That would be a good start down a very complex road. Whether banking, oil or in this case assault weapons, it’s all a shady practice
9738 2018-02-16 16:49:53 Thought I would be so #fit and run to my oil change appointment only to get there and realize I didn’t bring the fucking car so now I’m going to #jump into traffic

9741 2018-02-16 16:49:40 I was hoping to point out that @RoystonPotter was just a snake oil salesman, with no regard do the damage he causes.  I can't continue to follow him though as his posts literally sicken me.  I can't believe that people look to him as a shepherd.  I give up.  Good luck sheep.

9746 2018-02-16 16:49:05 What!!!   There are over 100,000 abandon oil wells in Alberta?  BTW: you can’t all move to the Okanagan and buy wineries @steeletalk
9747 2018-02-16 16:49:04 @OilandEnergy in one paragraph you make 2 contradictory statements about the

9752 2018-02-16 16:48:40 It's both. There's different denominations/ sects  of tap water twitter. there's "just drink water" there's  "water is my only cleanser", there's "water and cetaphil", "water and dove soap", "water and coconut oil/ olive oil"

9763 2018-02-16 16:47:47 Oil revenue should not have been used for programs/increasing wages/hiring more workers.  Structural deficit when oil hit bottom.  Oil should have been used for one time builds (schools) and paying down the debt @NLNDP #nlpoli

9765 2018-02-16 16:47:42 So polluting the watertable and contributing to carbon emissions is good for the environment? It's a lot better to burn Natural Gas than oil but I wouldn't call it good for the environment.

9785 2018-02-16 16:45:57 except it's not, but people associate anything bad that happens with oil and gas with fracking.  It's pretty much the same as anti-vaxx
9786 2018-02-16 16:45:56 Wildrose and the new what ever they call themselves wouldn't of done any better. the NDP is doing the best they can in this economy and low oil price.  I do not blame the NDP. That is probably why the Wildrose did not get elected because of there whining.
9787 2018-02-16 16:45:53 99% of lawmakers are in the MIC's pocket. Nothing changes until we replace them w/ true progressives.

After 5 taxes how petrol remain cheaper.

9881 2018-02-16 16:33:31 This should have the oil bears very worried. Market close to 5 year average. Saudi’s want it to go to the lower average using 2011-2015 data.
9882 2018-02-16 16:33:26 Flaxseed oil I'm sure lol
9883 2018-02-16 16:33:22 I am honestly so disappointed right now. I was strong all day and got myself a salad and it’s a mess. It has two rounds of cheese and half a bell pepper and an oil dressing. ITS JUST LETTUCE.  I am considering opening a gofundme for an emergency pizza delivery.  The tragedy.

9889 2018-02-16 16:32:53 Great source of untapped revenue w/o tax is Fed land oil and gas lease and royalties.  Goes straight to the treasury.

Trump is right to make use of it.  

But I would put that revenue toward health care costs (which are out of control and need addressing).

9897 2018-02-16 16:32:09 The climate will remain unchanged whatever Canada does.  Your alarmism is misplaced.  Neither global oil demand nor our global climate would change one iota with or without Canada’s oil industry. We are being played for fools and you’re buying the foolishness.
