9 2018-12-02 23:51:34 Because stocks have a better internal return than their savings account. Why do you think that people in US invest?

It is because of internal rates (P/E) and how quick a company can raise them.

44 2018-12-02 23:36:51 That’s right. A lot of Americans in the late 20’s never owned stocks. The crash didn’t effect them. The federal taxes Wilson created when he created the Federal Reserve DID effect every American.
45 2018-12-02 23:36:39 How can you have low gold, high dollar, high stocks, low yields? Something has to break out of those assets and I don't think they can get all of them.
46 2018-12-02 23:35:50 You had Congress, you controlled everything. How are you gonna blame the GOP for your own program? Admit your failure. Your failure is the reason we're even having this discussion. Money did indeed talk. Look at healthcare stocks after Obamacare passed. Democrats fleeced America

48 2018-12-02 23:34:22 Imo large holders will be unloading Chinese stocks over the next two months after the short rally up ends
49 2018-12-02 23:32:27 My stocks rising !
50 2018-12-02 23:32:14 Dow #futures up 400 points as expected after the tariff Rosè was cancelled over the weekend. Should be a good start to the week for longs. #stocks
51 2018-12-02 23:30:24 Stocks up nearly 2% on the open, oil up 2.5%.  Can't wait to see how the Ag markets respond tonight and tomorrow morning
52 2018-12-02 23:30:21 Most stocks and ETFs trade off exchange. The prices are still reported to a central point. So if you see a "current" price on one website it's not wildly different than another.
53 2018-12-02 23:29:46 You must know, after 2+ years of national debate, that none of your claims in your "fixed table" are in any reasonable sense true. The CFP has devastated fish stocks. EU grants are nothing more than our own money handed back with conditions attached. Yet still you push these lies
54 2018-12-02 23:29:15 What percentage do you think #Chinese stocks will rise tomorrow?
55 2018-12-02 23:29:11 Wow.  Not everybody owns stocks.  My granny fed strangers coming to their back door for months!!  Food lines, desperation.  People Had Nothing. Stocks may bounce back but not always people.  People are human not the bottom line.  My family was “lucky”-they had food. They lived it
56 2018-12-02 23:28:04 Thank you. Where is the closest store that stocks them?
57 2018-12-02 23:26:45 If you followed me out of stocks, then back in, and out, and back in again, and out and in and more in and out and now all in with leverage, nice.
58 2018-12-02 23:25:22 #indexfund need to rejig its operational efficiency. Its machines are too fast at jumping in and out of stocks on the index. In so doing, it basically buy high to sell low. Heating up overpriced stocks, crashing ones with a bad year. Good for #valueinvestor though #ausbiz
59 2018-12-02 23:24:35 It’ll be interesting to see how this futures reaction gets transmitted to individual stocks.
60 2018-12-02 23:23:26 Entrepreneurship can be a great alternative to the stock market. You can invest in someone else’s vision through stocks, or you can invest in YOUR VISION!

61 2018-12-02 23:22:37 @potus finally listened to @jimcramer @RevShark & @DougKass Bravo. #SaintPatricks Day in December, stocks all greem. #Santaclaus rally coming! Thank u @realDonaldTrump & Xi !
62 2018-12-02 23:22:25 Analyst foreseen a bearish trend incoming while steel & latex sectors seems to be in downplay. Last week breakouts should be monitored further before entries. A number of sell-off will happened as stocks loss shariah-compliant status. #bursamalaysia
63 2018-12-02 23:22:15 The ASX200 is approaching key support line of 5,766. Look for a bounce from this support level which opens up an aggressive short opportunity if you have the stomach for it.

67 2018-12-02 23:17:57 Bezos is literally a narcissist mentally unstable megalomaniac. Devoid of empathy. Its HIS fault they couldn't keep their bonuses. Regardless, week to week relief is what working class Americans want. Stocks... GTFOH
68 2018-12-02 23:16:13 Woodrow Wilson massive spending with his added progressive policy, horrible trade deals is what caused the depression. Stocks bounced back in a week.

70 2018-12-02 23:13:26 Back ground checks, ammunition storage and purchasing, clip/magazine/cartridge size, weapons attachments like bump stocks, types of ammunition, handguns are okay but my convicted abuser Ex husband with whom I have a court appointed restraining order should not have one.
71 2018-12-02 23:12:43 I can make small guitars. I can do very fine and creative finish carpentry. Yet, I've found myself on scaffolding in the Winter installing 88 windows in the mansion of a rich man who got rich by penny stocks and hedge funds and laundered money in Bermuda. I work for the rich.
72 2018-12-02 23:12:14 He invests in Chinese stocks too, not only in gold... What do you think is going to happen in the asian markets tomorrow? Idiot...
73 2018-12-02 23:11:00 So where are all the bears now??? SUCK IT!! I'm sticking to bullish call SP500 makes new high going into year end!

Those haters could have save people a lot of money if they focused less on the love hearts and hope and more on the fundamental and technical analysis of the stocks they trade.
75 2018-12-02 23:08:11 Watch stocks plummet and a MAJOR recession begin when she gets her dirty hands in OUR finances in January. People will be selling out right and left.

79 2018-12-02 23:03:02 I'd get better returns by letting my dog pick my stocks.
80 2018-12-02 23:02:00 Because that’s what it costs to be a human who doesn’t need to rely on the government for basic needs. Again: You can make up the disparity with tax dollars, or government can put price controls on the labor market. If they can buyback stocks, they can pay higher wages.
81 2018-12-02 23:01:35 The things that brought down oil are now no longer a barrier. Oil and oil stocks can all rise now assuming the SP500 rises too.
82 2018-12-02 22:59:24 Err, no. Car manufacturers could not rent warehouses, they aren't lying around empty, and they would need huge stocks and it would tie up huge working capital. Sorry, friction at the border will just mean new models are made elsewhere. Simple.
83 2018-12-02 22:58:47 The bump stocks were allowed by Democrats and the NRA came out against them.

86 2018-12-02 22:44:15 Do you think the government should take over those healthcare businesses? If that was the case, they wouldn't have publicly traded stocks and wouldn't generate the money the currently do. Mostly, the incentive for growth would slowly fade, and profits would diminish over time too
87 2018-12-02 22:42:11 Capitalism= GM $500 million in profits, $150 million in tax cut, lay off 14,000 employee, their stocks price increase, Socialism=the owners of the factories are still millionaires, but the workers gets a living wage, and are able to retire from the job with a reasonable pension.

90 2018-12-02 22:40:45 I think it will be a big nothing for the #markets, as its so clear this non deal ann was only to try & attempt a Dec rally to make the pollies look good. There is no other positive news to push #stocks higher now especially knowing the #FED is pulling the trigger in a few wks.

129 2018-12-02 22:07:36 Ultimate is gonna have to be 4 stocks at this rate
130 2018-12-02 22:07:18 For example, to get the 15m employees for the GreenNewDeal: Medicare4all sheds maybe 5 million workers; a 0 rate policy, narrow banking, and keeping insured pension funds out of stocks millions more; and maybe 5 million can come from people currently unemployed.
131 2018-12-02 22:05:00 I know too many single people, in their 30's, who got into #realestate AND #stocks right at the top. So sad to see they are never going to recover and I don't care if they have an #MBA. I often say "higher education" knocks the common sense out of otherwise smart people. #life
132 2018-12-02 22:02:22 Has she looked at a chart of the big defense and aerospace stocks lately? I can find some of the funds
133 2018-12-02 22:00:58 Penny stocks don’t take much money to mess around with it it’s a good way to learn how business and the economy works as well as the stock market anybody can start to do that you can read a book about it there’s information about it on the Internet
134 2018-12-02 22:00:15 I say we put them in stocks on the steps of the Lincoln memorial, where passersby are free to slap the shit out of them. Open-palm only, pissing in their faces is also encouraged.
135 2018-12-02 21:59:59 Put them in stocks on the National Mall so we can render our opinions generously & expectorate in their general direction!
136 2018-12-02 21:55:47 old people: we demand higher returns on our stocks, so cut labor. 
Also old people: not enough registers for us to use! 
Old people again: automation is scary, we want physical checkers, but also don't hire any more.
137 2018-12-02 21:54:48 Agree, some are over-allocated to stocks in retirement and that risk alignment w/ plan is v. important  I'd add that in *real* terms, stocks were more often abv water (vs 1929 high) after Feb '45, and a 60/40 mix (stocks/5-yr govt bond, rebal'd yrly) was abv water after July '35.
138 2018-12-02 21:53:44 My my Lying Mayor Turner will have people wearing stocks wanting donations at the Bush celebration Monday Night. The Bushes are rich do I bet thieving Turner will use that money for his own personal use.
139 2018-12-02 21:51:58 Trump Hotels are the best in the World, no bed bugs but plenty of FBI bugs. He stocks each hotel room with his personal grooming items, Old Spice, Depends and Pert Plus. The place to stay is the Mushroom Room which is a salute to his phallic.
140 2018-12-02 21:50:20 Must we remind them what @Kite_FL did to literally half their team stocks LOL
141 2018-12-02 21:50:20 Guillotine stocks are on the rise.
142 2018-12-02 21:50:15 The article reinforces what we're discussing:

"Stocks that suffered breaches since 2015 initially dropped against the NASDAQ. Prior to the breach, they underperformed the NASDAQ slightly, but they recovered after their breaches to ultimately outpace the NASDAQ six months later."
143 2018-12-02 21:49:23 Huh your wrong just like u r about stocks. That's ok you can live in your own truth.....
144 2018-12-02 21:48:25 Yes, for 90 days. Expect risk appetite to increase as trading begins. #AUD #NZD would gain, #JPY falls. Asia stocks, and #EmergingMarkets could rally. The question is if this could last, especially if the global growth outlook could improve, perhaps increasing 2019 #Fed hike bets
145 2018-12-02 21:47:13 If you buy 100 shares of IBM, how much what you pay goes to IBM? The answer is 0. Buying stocks does nothing to stimulate investment.
146 2018-12-02 21:47:08 So ? GWHDD are the same vs Friday for both ensembles. And if u average all 16 days isn't still below avg? If we just have avg temps the rest of winter stocks end up below 1,000bcf
147 2018-12-02 21:46:34 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your depression
148 2018-12-02 21:45:47 Penny stocks are up.

150 2018-12-02 21:45:33 oh silly sweetheart, Bush did the same thing, held onto stocks in his company even after he sold off BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BE PRESIDENT FOREVER.  Its not a lifetime appointment, dont make it one! He gets to continue living his life after. Is this your first president?  it must be 
151 2018-12-02 21:44:12 @Commish_Stocks
152 2018-12-02 21:42:31 Agreed. A known unknown facing the market is what US will do when sanction exemptions on Iran oil is up for renewals in a few months. in short term though all I hear is short gamma...not just in oil, now the same is said for stocks to year end. Not sure what to make of it.
153 2018-12-02 21:41:41 Same old same old deramps a multitude of stocks to try and get entry so transparent
154 2018-12-02 21:41:30 Bringing back the cup winner cup? Always my favourite named competition. #stillknownothingaboutfootball
155 2018-12-02 21:40:18 But going by shares isn't an accurate depiction of how the average American is doing though... I have few stocks, but no more than $200 worth and I can't afford to buy more. Plus it's really risky.

160 2018-12-02 21:37:05 teka andaming stocks ng holo sticker
161 2018-12-02 21:36:49 Starting false rumours I don't believe in that!!! But false rumours are started by the pumpers as well, Jack ma buying $SX for $10.00 .....mom and Pop should stick to big caps,  speculative stocks are a huge gamble. Especially the CSE and junior exploration companies ,crap shoot
162 2018-12-02 21:36:24 Well then if they're not going to turn in their bump stocks, then I highly doubt that they would surrender their "assault weapons" if Eric Swalwell tried to buy them back.
163 2018-12-02 21:35:51 Speaking of laughing stocks, everyone on the internet who would like to be Jacob Wohl please raise your hand.
164 2018-12-02 21:34:26 With the tarrifs, he gave China the upper hand and Trump screwed American companies, farmers, and factory workers. The tax scam only gave the money to companies to purchase back stocks.
165 2018-12-02 21:34:17 Seeing all my stocks grow is the best feeling 
166 2018-12-02 21:33:39 Point is only valid if our economy was big and strong enough to make a difference to EM stocks as you're suggesting it is in order to support a bias claim, and if it is, then we should be able to cope with a no deal Brexit, no? If it's not, then the bias claim is on flimsy basis?
167 2018-12-02 21:32:22 that's true -- I used to use stocks but now all my recents are made without stocks. also without stocks your work it also original
168 2018-12-02 21:31:12 like economic stocks? 
169 2018-12-02 21:31:05 Must have shorted EA stocks.

171 2018-12-02 21:29:58 Under international law iScot would have ownership of all oil & fish in their waters. They'd obviously have to accede access to fishing stocks when joining a union but it's up to them to decide which one. UK thought they wouldn't have to; Scots saw it coming a mile off
172 2018-12-02 21:29:51 For a good minute I thought you were talking about Stocks like actually stocks lol
173 2018-12-02 21:28:37 Stocks are a good starting point for beginners but if you begin to rely on stocks it will slow your growth as a designer.
174 2018-12-02 21:27:39 They sell guns, silences, stocks, flash suppressors, high capacity magazines, ammo, targets, mods, and education shooting videos on the internet.
Just in case you wanted to leave Twitter you know because it’s on the internet.
175 2018-12-02 21:27:01 Spot spread betting for FX, actual stocks and options are all better me that futures. Maybe because I did not tried it ..
176 2018-12-02 21:26:07 Now seems like a good time to remind everyone that if it was Obama banning bump stocks and not Trump, Republicans would be marching in the streets, open carrying and yelling “MOLON LABE”
177 2018-12-02 21:25:12 How much did big tobacco pay you? They are partying right now. Their stocks skyrocketed. All thanks to you

This isnt going to keep vapes out of kids hands. Good parents and proper education does that. All this does it make tobacco once again relevant. So much for a progression.
178 2018-12-02 21:24:13 We are long stocks unhedged.
179 2018-12-02 21:22:50 Trump has been stricter on gun laws than Obama by faaaaaar... The right doesn't care because he's Trump, lol.. He can do no wrong in his supporters eyes. Again, bump stocks. Why are you not pissed?
180 2018-12-02 21:22:30 US sanctions on Venezuela only affect stocks & bonds issued by Venezuelan oil company, and freezes visas & American assets of top govt. officials. There are specific exemptions for food & medicine, sanctions don't touch that. Venezuela also rejected aid & medicine donated by DWB
181 2018-12-02 21:22:04 バック・ヴォーカルには当時「キープ・オン・ダンシング」を大ヒットさせたクリオ＆ケイ*が参加しています。彼は、後の90年に、ダン・ハートマンのヒット曲「リライト・マイ・ファイヤー」をリメイクしてリリースしています。『EURO CLASSICS』JEROME STOCKS
182 2018-12-02 21:19:52 Obama didn't want your guns, lol.. Omg omg, lets just stop this discussion right now. I don't have time for Breitbart minded opinions. Where is your outrage over Trump banning bump stocks last week??? I'll wait..
183 2018-12-02 21:19:29 You are really doing good with your trusted stocks/options/etfs.
184 2018-12-02 21:17:45 Demandons l'usine et les stocks de farine. Pourquoi laisser quoi que ce soit entre les mains de ceux qui accaparent ?
185 2018-12-02 21:14:58 i think if you want to help raise with gaon the only thing is buying from the jonghyun search account cause they have a preorder, while other stores just have stocks that have already been counted towards gaon at this point
186 2018-12-02 21:14:36 They are doing it cause most of the stocks are actually worthless, hence $HIVE @ $5  etc....  Most stocks on TSXV CSE are all worth zero. Money losing ,hopes and dreams. So they know to naked short sell its a business
187 2018-12-02 21:13:41 apple stocks rise by 30%.
188 2018-12-02 21:13:40 I’ll get back in I got scared out some stocks over a month ago because I was afraid of a larger market correction.

190 2018-12-02 21:10:39 @MayorofLondon public humiliation by way of re-introduction of the stocks are the way forward for this disorderly bunch of above the law thugs.  Police monetary incentives for results and more police will help combat crime.

193 2018-12-02 21:08:06 Selling puts, but having a difficult time finding stocks I want to own, based on value fundamentals.  Sitting in cash to avoid owning at the end of a bull cycle.  Analysis / paralysis 
194 2018-12-02 21:08:02 Grains then stocks. I don't trade grains as much, fundamentals and info very specialized. I know we'll know in a few hours, yet this outcome should have been expected.
195 2018-12-02 21:05:43 Quite possible. Or companies diverting more to the UK and causing smaller stocks here? Not in the media, not sure.

203 2018-12-02 20:53:46 Yeap. Tournament for the riches. Keep improving their stocks but nobody gives a fuck about football.
204 2018-12-02 20:53:38 It has to at least be 3 stocks
205 2018-12-02 20:52:36 Was helping a friend do a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation on some stock. Pretty fun. 
Crazy how you can easily smidge the numbers to get what you want lol. 
#finance #discountedcashflow #cashflow #valuation #DCF #stocks #stockmarket
206 2018-12-02 20:52:09 Or - I would venture - be welcomed in to EFTA with open arms. A near monopoly of all Western Europe oil reserves and enough fish stocks to service the entire annual EU demands? Would give EFTA some clout.
207 2018-12-02 20:51:39 The N64 has a Utilt combo which it happens forever and that's why N64 only does 5 Stocks, In Ultimate I found out, You can Jab lock at least 2 times when they feel in the ground, also after 2 jablocks, they can still roll or get up, so it's a 50/50 mindgame.
208 2018-12-02 20:50:31 Value investors view the stock market differently. They don’t believe that the stock market consists of stocks. They know that the stock market consists of real companies. That little difference explains why value investors consistently beat the stock market year after year.
209 2018-12-02 20:50:18 Just as rekt as those guys that tried to play weed stocks a few months before that, or are they the same people. 

Ain’t shit changed.
210 2018-12-02 20:50:13 The additional harm this does is create tax arbitrage biasing investment decision away from growth stocks towards cash stocks, which in turn puts undue pressure on companies not to invest, but pay dividends instead. I worked for an infrastructure business, the impact is insidious
211 2018-12-02 20:49:29 $cara, $zyne, $trtc, $mmnff, $smg, $gwprf. Canada’s cannabis market is the size of California’s so I don’t invest in Canadian LP’s unless they go international. OTC pot stocks are really easy trades bc there are no smart comps or algos. $phot, $mjna, $hemp $budz are good trades
212 2018-12-02 20:48:48 The more they talk the more and more obvious it becomes they have ZERO clue how/why stocks move. Smh
213 2018-12-02 20:45:09 So which one of these is the left angry about lowering taxes for the middle class bringing back jobs getting employees bonuses and raises stopping North Korea from sending missiles over Japan Bringing down prescription prices getting vets medical attention quicker   Stocks up

215 2018-12-02 20:43:40 stocks rise by 1%.
216 2018-12-02 20:43:05 Great point. The RUN cup and handle is what originally led me to bring it up in the chat. A fresh perspective on weekends will often help you find new gems or why some stocks are finding support recently off the lows at key moving averages.
217 2018-12-02 20:42:55 Isn't our economy too small to stand on its own feet? If so, why would Brexit move the needle on EM stocks?

221 2018-12-02 20:37:24 Love the stocks at the bg good job brother! <3
222 2018-12-02 20:37:07 @NancyPelosi You wealthy and powerful folks keep crowing about how well the "economy" is doing because YOUR stocks are booming and YOUR bank account is swelling.  Take a bother to peek at the plight of regular hard working Americans. Same old same old will NOT CUT IT anymore.
223 2018-12-02 20:36:19 Rolls Royce stocks went down because of that incident. They already hurting bad and lost a lot of money.
224 2018-12-02 20:36:11 So you see bitcoin as a short cut to her a lambo then stocks and bonds? At least you are honest :-)
225 2018-12-02 20:35:19 I’ve been doing some readings on stocks. Your boy ready
226 2018-12-02 20:34:44 living like a poor man i have poor mans thoughts, wanna try out stocks, man.

228 2018-12-02 20:32:54 That’s not what I do. I don’t deal with stocks nor individuals.
229 2018-12-02 20:32:27 you are part of the problem IMHO. It is a game meant to be played first and foremost. If you wanna play stocks go to wallstreet
230 2018-12-02 20:31:39 A quiet laugh escaped the girl. This guy was so silly. Too bad he had to be crushed! Sakura was determined to win.

Unfortunately, Falcon took the hit, slammed across the stage at a relatively high speed. His percentage was racking up. Luckily, he still had two stocks left, and -

233 2018-12-02 20:29:18 I like roy and even im not cool with just exploding stocks
234 2018-12-02 20:27:49 It could be a great Monday for stocks, soybeans and currencies. Investors are taking their cue from the trade truce between Trump and Xi. -- Bloomberg
235 2018-12-02 20:27:18 Jesus Christ that's a lot of stocks.
236 2018-12-02 20:24:48 Of the stocks that I own, the one I wish I had some say in the workings of the organization is my #Packers stock.  MM would've been gone years ago. Lucky to have 2 HoF QBs. Was with worst offense as OC before taking job. Ted also has much blame as much as he did for the Packers
237 2018-12-02 20:23:28 Playing the API number in '09 and having a basket of stocks set up for a draw, instead, there was a build and the trading platform went down for the whole trading floor(including my stop losses)..finally was able to be flattened out..lost a bundle and had a liquid dinner..smh..
238 2018-12-02 20:21:42 Biotech stocks are doing great, big month for biotech. Watch
239 2018-12-02 20:21:21 Probably a good time to buy semiconductor stocks.
240 2018-12-02 20:21:11 What gets me is they complain at a time when spending is going UP at unsustainable levels & President Facepalm's signing gun control legislation to pointlessly ban "bump stocks." Isn't that what the political left *wants*?!?
241 2018-12-02 20:21:03 MOURINHO has to be sacked because after 3 YEARS; 

1.) We don't have a starting 11

243 2018-12-02 20:20:36 Would like to see a big early morning move in the morning that fades into the day creating a large daily candle which makes stocks move lower on the week
244 2018-12-02 20:20:24 Not going to pretend I know what happens with stocks, I will say one thing.  Have not heard anyone who does NOT think it is up , up and away.  Santa rally,  the t man lies/obfuscation and general all around BS.  Take your pick.

253 2018-12-02 20:14:49 Hi Rachel, unfortunately the closest store I can find to Penrith that stocks these is the Hexham Extra which is 33 miles away or the Consett Genesis Extra which is 38 miles away. TY - Nat
254 2018-12-02 20:14:41 Oh loh lohh @TSM_Leffen's use of falco's laser jab usmash to finish stocks is so cool to see. Hope we see more falcos using it
255 2018-12-02 20:14:26 They literally took it out of their workers pockets when they started buying back stocks instead of raising wages.
256 2018-12-02 20:13:38 apple stocks rise by 35%.

260 2018-12-02 20:11:41 Any guesses as to how cdn oil and gas stocks react with a restriction on production? I could make a case for both sides. Short term pain for long term gain. Hard to know what investors will focus on but given how beat down certain names are any action might help.

262 2018-12-02 20:10:43 Just cause Trump is breaking another promise does not mean stocks or oil prices are going to go up. It only means he does not know what he is doing, and us trying to control something he has no clue about. We will see tomorrow.

302 2018-12-02 19:25:07 I'm a veteran, I can tell you that government run healthcare isn't as great as you think it is...  Anyways, a CEO is paid based on his companies stock price.

307 2018-12-02 19:21:00 If you have a successful plan then don't change what's working but if you find you are struggling and watch upwards of 20+ stocks each day - refine your list, weed out the best 5 MAX and focus all your attention on them instead of spreading yourself out trying to track em all.
308 2018-12-02 19:20:41 Trump only cares about equities going up. It enriches his little team in the admin. The dollar weakening is good for EM and US stocks in my view.
309 2018-12-02 19:20:30 so mays using the money she makes from the show to buy homes? well if she's investing in them thats one thing but if she's being careless with the money she makes  its a regret she have to live with. she needs to out it into stocks and houses they make about 7 to 10,000 a show

385 2018-12-02 18:12:35 In March Our Algo Predicted #SPX Would Climb To 3,000 End 2018-Early 2019. At That Time Experts Were Predicting #SPX Would Crash. Guess What? #SPX Staged The Biggest Bull Run From That 2,530 Low. Talk Is Cheap. Accuracy Is Priceless. We Started Buying Stocks In April ....

389 2018-12-02 18:10:28 Yes, I’m heading to a game next week. Can you imaging in if companies like np Morgan started firing ppl or ppl took out thier stocks, etc cause an situation with a trader. Companies only do stuff like that if the dollar is effected. This situation will not affect $.
390 2018-12-02 18:09:59 3/ Whales will keep pumping the market for some time (may be 1-2 years), lot of ads, newspaper articles, promotions etc. Everywhere you will hear about stocks till lot of normal people get in. Then slowly whales sell their stock to those people and get out of stock market.
391 2018-12-02 18:09:53 Omg I’m planning to go Monday I hope they have stocks left 
392 2018-12-02 18:09:06 The only issue is that most of the stocks are down. Where do you really recover money? Saarey Amrish Puri hai yahan
393 2018-12-02 18:08:35 Let me tell you how FB & Twitter are puppets of some big corrupt & liberal share holders:

1. For example Shillary hates Loomer, so she calls one of her friends who holds large tech shares

2. Share holder calls Jack and tells him: shut that person now or I am pulling my stocks!
394 2018-12-02 18:08:16 What do you think, how much will stocks of companies with high leverage but long maturity struggle? (In relation to the next QE kicking in by then)
395 2018-12-02 18:07:27 Banning bump stocks is such a lazy, empty gesture, that really only jeopardizes the 2nd amendment by setting a precedent.. 

... Change my mind.
396 2018-12-02 18:06:42 @ImYourKid  do you invest in pot stocks? Would you recommend it?
397 2018-12-02 18:06:10 Convicted of securities fraud, @JacobAWohl probably shouldn't even mention stocks or exchanges.
398 2018-12-02 18:04:37 Wow so genius.  Must be the king of stocks right?
399 2018-12-02 18:04:32 2/ Now whales will make the market interesting to retail investors by bringing in volatility and showing quick gains. Only when gains are quick and easy and when their neighbours are making money buying some random stock, normal people get in to stocks.

406 2018-12-02 17:57:16 I followed a link to a financial website claiming they knew the top 25 stocks to invest in next year. The site immediately wanted me to turn off the ad blocker. If they have such good information on stocks, why do they need ad revenue?
407 2018-12-02 17:56:21 People playing Smash Ultimate with 2 stocks this ain’t Sm4sh people lmao
408 2018-12-02 17:54:32 I published a journal article in the early 90s that showed money flowing into index funds altered returns, adding 35 basis points PER MONTH to stocks belonging to the S&P 500 index.  Alas, active managers have been both terrible investors and ghastly expensive so passive is best.

413 2018-12-02 17:50:24 Interested to know which stocks T and his friends shorted before his announced trade war, and which they bought at lows before he announced relaxation of said trade war.
414 2018-12-02 17:50:13 I would have walked out also.    Any gun dealer that sells guns with pink stocks is not respectable
415 2018-12-02 17:49:17 Your criticisms are valid, but I think you are looking at the broader forest when I am trying to focus you on the trees. I am a sell side analyst and have been for the last three years. We’ve been underweight on multiple stocks over this time.

427 2018-12-02 17:39:28 Possible en effet les brand manager ont du prendre pleins de tickets chez ITunes pour le digital mais pour les albums physiques il y’a des exports donc les délais stocks peuvent être plus longs. Je dis juste de faire attention à tout ces aspects avant de tirer des conclusions.
428 2018-12-02 17:39:03 So many stocks & ETFs have the same W formation. The key will be if the center part can be taken out and held. If not it is nothing more than a selling resistance moment with a triangle potential. You know me and my hatred of V bottoms! Trend is your friend still. Be PATIENT.

431 2018-12-02 17:37:16 I know very few IRL that do stocks (most around here don’t seem to invest at all) but many that do seem to be millennials use Robinhood. I think being mobile is the big attractiveness.

437 2018-12-02 17:30:04 You have to invest in something productive to avoid losing purchasing power to inflation. With a currency that appreciates you can just hold the currency and it decreases the amount of someone's capital that is being put back into the economy via stocks bonds etc.

446 2018-12-02 17:22:39 Not strictly true. Assets such as stocks and property have soared since the financial crisis in part due to QE. The rich generally own these 2 assets (as do pension funds). They're fortunate. They're not taking money from the poor and pay the majority of tax already.

460 2018-12-02 17:12:18 Seems completely logical, but then again, Japan. I might argue that organizations or governments, run on solid metrics, will perform better consistently. Harder that it looks, but worth learning what those measures should be. Metaphor would be how analysts research stocks & macro

Don’t wait for the McRib to be out to go to McDonald’s. Don’t wait for the cues - make revival happen now.
470 2018-12-02 17:01:14 its something to do with psychology i believe. I have so many frnds who own stocks like suzlon. They dont want to book loss bcoz thats like accepting that they made a mistake.i strongly feel just like we have higher targets,we must have a stop loss in investing too.

479 2018-12-02 16:53:11 Take it easy my friend. My article didn’t pronounce verdict on crypto as stocks. It merely stated technical bounces after large sell offs.

482 2018-12-02 16:50:08 This deal makes sense for both teams. Having Cano on a 5 year 60 million dollar team isn’t terrible. Should give you $12 million per year production. At least for a few years. Plus you get a top 5 closer in the game. Seattle clears money and stocks the farm.

495 2018-12-02 16:39:13 Pas évident à évaluer, à cause des emballages? Il y a potentiellement des gains en face : optimisation logistique en groupant les livraisons, moins de stocks, vélo vs voiture etc? d’une manière générale le e-commerce a un meilleur bilan carbone que le commerce traditionnel

I’d like to see anyone transport the sheer volume of food stocks into a town or city that is required for trade and tourism. Are EV’s allowed? If so then maybe it would be possible
498 2018-12-02 16:35:46 Honestly....I can't always tell.  Maybe even most of the time.

This is like 90s dotcom stocks, in which the Nasdaq crashed 93%, and 90%+ of those stocks NEVER RECOVERED, but WORSE. 99% of cryptos today will go to 0, and that is almost all the coins that have dropped the most already, that are more "primed" to make 3x, 4x etc gains

511 2018-12-02 16:24:44 Ray makes it sound like a decision between stocks or bonds. “don’t make a bad business decision” He still has not shown a sense of basic right or wrong with that comment.  No progress; some will say you can’t expect what hasn’t been taught. Sad solace for those punched or kicked.
512 2018-12-02 16:23:40 Thanks. Just an amateur trader that likes tech stocks. I have a position both, but Apple’s tumble came from the last investor’s call and we have to wait at least a quarter to judge the longer term effect.
513 2018-12-02 16:22:33 Dammnnn am dead I prefer shorting more stocks under 10 and 1$ and they require margin and not cash accounts ohhhh mannnnn I really had my hopes up hehehe buhhh umm thanks alot for the great insight am super grateful 
514 2018-12-02 16:21:47 even with stocks, market cap is calculated using all OUTSTANDING shares, meaning any share that is issued even by the company or employees( even ones with selling stipulation).
515 2018-12-02 16:21:42 One great insight can open your eyes and has the power to change your life. It can come from an experience, a wise person, a book, a lecture or a fine webinar for that matter! 

Like in stocks, gathering wisdom is also about how many rocks you are willing to turn.
516 2018-12-02 16:21:04 In terms of how to value a cryptocurrency, I argue that protocol layers should be evaluated as both a commodity and currency. In the case of some application and network layers evaluation can be compared stocks. The currency evaluation does carry more weight in protocol layers.

518 2018-12-02 16:19:49 This could be of interest to $AVGO or $SFTBY to green light a run at $NXPI.  $QCOM could rework the deal but this opens the door for a run at many cheap semi stocks
519 2018-12-02 16:17:07 Going to pay some bills. Put some bread in savings. Cop some crypto and allocate funds for stocks.
520 2018-12-02 16:16:23 Serious question Pomp. What’s the best way to explain blockchain, cryptocurrency and blockchain to a 5 year old? I talk investments with my 5 year old quite a bit but it’s mainly centered around stocks and it’s simpler to explain.

522 2018-12-02 16:13:28 It is unsettling when we have people who want to limit voting rights and add obstacles to effective democracy, yet at the same time think its cool that we allow same day gun purchases, bump stocks and high capacity magazines
523 2018-12-02 16:12:57 TOTALLY  agree  with  you  so  many ways  to  the  Pot of  Gold , basic  TA  of  index  stocks  works  for  me

525 2018-12-02 16:11:26 Maybe a public shaming. Stick them in stocks in the center of town??? I don't care, but I can't even watch this shit anymore.
526 2018-12-02 16:11:13 Beans will have knee jerk reaction.  Then reality will set in on the massive stocks we are dealing with.
527 2018-12-02 16:11:10 Every other company besides Facebook who never listened to me check out their stocks.

532 2018-12-02 16:07:21 the suits have only one rule and its the money rule. so until mathematically we are off 4th then they can get away with a cheap sacking.
the morons dont realise that if players leave or stocks drop over next 6 months it'll cost way more than 14m
533 2018-12-02 16:05:03 In other words, physical gold, kept in your personal possession. Not gold stocks!
534 2018-12-02 16:03:44 So will your food stocks I'm betting
535 2018-12-02 16:03:40 I definitely think the reaction will be positive at first. But you're right. Last week I calculated that w/ 955 mbu and unch supply, use would have to increase by 485 mbu to get stocks/use to last year's levels (10.2%, which was the highest in 11 years).
536 2018-12-02 16:03:23 There are people out there who are making money even with a simple 200 DMA system, or a buy only oversold stocks, or do only expiry trades, or do covered calls only.... All are successful with ANY system provided they have rules in place and they stick to it
537 2018-12-02 16:03:17 Fed QT rhetoric is reverse QE: Stocks up= raise rates. Stocks down= cite Econ data, raise rates. It’s that simple kids.
538 2018-12-02 16:02:26 Et si nous avions des stocks  de vaccins dans nos cabinets  ? Pour vacciner rapidement à  toute occasion  ?
539 2018-12-02 16:02:13 Been saying within 1-6 months of end of QT all year (wrongly). I believe Powell wants to normalize monetary policy, but can't. I take him at his word that economic data and financial data will determine. So higher stocks will delay the end and lower stocks and credit will end it
540 2018-12-02 16:01:30 I use it for stocks.
541 2018-12-02 16:01:03 Absolute b/s stocks are going much lower in 2019
542 2018-12-02 15:57:36 well I'll be damned. @Crypto_Macro: Risk is on! Stocks  Basically Trump and Xi agreed to a truce, with both deciding to halt additional tariffs for now and agreeing to engage in negotiations with the goal of reaching an agreement within 90 days.

545 2018-12-02 15:55:42 At least that will make the January stocks number more fun.
546 2018-12-02 15:55:41 Shareholders can sell stocks
547 2018-12-02 15:54:59 IMO he checked.  To mix my metaphors, China's econ took brunt of 1st rds of Trade tensions.  In last 8 wks, US econ has taken some haymakers - shale, housing, stocks.  Trump needed to get to neutral corner to get "legs under" shale, housing, stks or else he was getting in trouble
548 2018-12-02 15:54:20 Koko do a cream cheese? Who stocks it? My Tesco only has their own, and Morrisons near me has none.

553 2018-12-02 15:50:25 Keep in perspective that FANGMA stocks represent 15 - 20% of the entire s and p 500 makeup.
554 2018-12-02 15:49:54 Us is steal don't want the Tariff and we are hurting the car industry. That tax cut for corporation was a dumb move because they buy back stocks and don't invest in America it's the American way. Liberal Conservatives are being fuck.
555 2018-12-02 15:47:46 Getting a sense of overwhelming positivity returning.

Could see some very quick reversals for some stocks.

Get researching people....
556 2018-12-02 15:46:56 Bring back the stocks
557 2018-12-02 15:45:44 How is Peter wrong?  He has been saying that stocks are in a bubble, not that they haven’t gone up since Trump was elected.

563 2018-12-02 15:32:50 @SenJohnBarrasso Putin OWNS Trump.  And YOU do not care.  Never forget. What are you covering up.  Free trader?   Trump successful?  Take a look at farmers books.  Steel stocks down.  Coal stocks down.  Auto stocks down.  Food cost up. Healthcare cost up.  Housing cost up.
564 2018-12-02 15:32:48 Penny stocks declines are largely done.  Won’t be any fireworks till after dec 15 and tax loss selling completion tho.

566 2018-12-02 15:31:27 Um, if you are a "Dr", you're clearly not a very good one, Jane.  If you took a second to do an ounce of research, you would see Twitter's stock price is up over this time in 2017, 2016 and 2015.  Popular stocks always drop a bit and then, more than likely, rebound.  Idiot.

646 2018-12-02 14:23:33 So thanks to @io8_8ov and my wife who translated many Chinese websites, it is safe to say that the PPT has now decided that getting the punters on the ground to buy stocks is the best way for them to protect the market and recover. Helicopter money coming next for the punters????
647 2018-12-02 14:22:24 Wages doesn't matter really, rather real wages with actual purchasing power is all that matters. The save/consume ratio is important too. 
It wouldn't be too bad to be paid in gold, that you can actually use to buy stuff and invest in stocks as soon as you get your wage.
648 2018-12-02 14:20:59 Monday will be a rocket ride for stocks after US & China agree on no more tariffs...for now. @jimcramer
649 2018-12-02 14:18:36 I always bear without the internet stocks ?!?
650 2018-12-02 14:16:15 I had a dream. I was in wooden stocks. I was being paddled until my ass was bright red. Imagine being in such a deep headspace, all you do is drool and take it.
651 2018-12-02 14:15:58 That's under the assumption that spending 20 trillion to inflate bonds and stocks is NOT conducive to "damage". @dlacalle_IA @DiMartinoBooth

657 2018-12-02 14:04:00 Altcoins are destined to become the penny stocks of cryptocurrencies. Pumping and dumping on nothing but false promises and hope.
658 2018-12-02 14:03:48 "The fundamentals of our economy are strong." Soon to be defeated presidential candidate John McCain on 9/15/2008. And yet whenever the economy shows strength, the talking heads still say we should buy stocks. Will we never learn?

660 2018-12-02 14:02:49 My stocks have really fallen @MOU5ERAT casually roasting me.
661 2018-12-02 14:02:32 Another sticky plaster !! To stop the fall in stocks trumps main worry, it will be another 90 days after 90 days ...... he cannot stand the thought of a stock crash on his watch , Powell gave in  and he gave in to XI   Stock are coming down next year anyway ....
662 2018-12-02 14:01:55 We began to invest right towards the end of the fc in late '08. Unfortunately, we didn't have much money then. Nevertheless, it lay the foundations for our journey to #FIRE and I'm still happy we were brave enough to buy stocks while the market was still in sell-off-mode.
663 2018-12-02 14:00:29 Bonjour, 
Votre commande rencontre devrait partir la semaine prochaine de nos stocks, désolé pour ce contretemps. Je vous invite à revenir vers moi à réception de vos articles pour voir ce qu'il est possible de faire. Cdt Luck.
664 2018-12-02 13:59:06 I agree of course but have heard the same tune before many a time. Haven't lost my faith but everything points to gold and it continues to languish. Gold stocks on the other hand are too painful to talk about on a Sunday morning. #Pain #weary #gold
665 2018-12-02 13:58:10 LREM, la république du lancer de grenades... Macron en a fait acheter pour des millions d'euros dès son investiture, des stocks destinés à réprimer pour les 5 ans de son mandat, il avait anticipé ce qui se passerait.

672 2018-12-02 13:52:20 Oh I see but your states taxes are one of the highest in Am. Which takes more $ from the working class than those with stocks. Right.  People must be real dumbasses to believe such a statement.

681 2018-12-02 13:40:23 Your comments are ridiculous.
I'm a trained scientist FFS so am extremely objective
I also have investing rules: that is to take profit regularly and divest
I like investing in $5-10M MC stocks and riding them
Like $CLA was once upon a time
;D
682 2018-12-02 13:40:19 I like offshore wind, although there maybe an issue with the habit for sea life surrounding them due to vibrations. I wasn't aware of this until I spoke to someone who lived on the Cumbria coast, and apparently fish stocks are down.

JPM Kolanovic “You can have a fundamental thesis and it may not work out for quarters or even years because other flows dominate. I think fundamental investors are becoming aware of that and they are increasingly asking why their stocks are not acting as expected.”
685 2018-12-02 13:37:49 I think Flake is a coward most of the time, but I thank him for not voting for Farr. And what about Cotton, who is refusing to support prison reform... I wonder if he owns stocks in private prisons?
686 2018-12-02 13:37:04 Keep the risk small & controlled
When ever possible, Eliminate it.

711 2018-12-02 12:54:58 Does this  “ When you do reinvest dividends, that basket of stocks does 33.72 percent better than the annuity.” reflect the after tax # or are you deliberately #misleading your readers?

717 2018-12-02 12:50:53 #copper LME stocks down 56% since beginning June 18 whilst copper price also down 12.5% same period. It doesn’t stack up! Recovery coming!

721 2018-12-02 12:47:11 Will you throw me out for asking - does the following - “ When you do reinvest dividends, that basket of stocks does 33.72 percent better than the annuity.” - represent the after tax return? Or do you not want readers to have that # ...
722 2018-12-02 12:46:58 Nos ingénieux délinquants ont choisi de piller les stocks des boutiques à la meilleure période de l année.
723 2018-12-02 12:46:38 They're also being forcing into the stock market to look for a better return on what they're getting. That's a false promise too. As share buybacks inflate company stocks with no real increase in productivity or sales. When the company goes tits up. They've got nothing.

730 2018-12-02 12:41:59 Generally, I'm in favour of better rehabilitation. In this case though, I'd like to see them bring back the stocks.
731 2018-12-02 12:41:44 My guess?  The international stocks killed you here.  European share returns, in general, have reflected the rapid deterioration in the European economic prospects. They put on a brave face, but stats reveal Europeans are just hanging on.
732 2018-12-02 12:40:25 I vote for you to be put in stocks and have rotten fruit thrown at you for being an absolute tool....

737 2018-12-02 12:32:18 *dont beat the market average in the long run ***
So I suggest safe bonds for most of the money, then buy some great stocks (not too diversified) and also have some exposure to gold. In my humble opinion.
738 2018-12-02 12:30:16 Jeff, are our Pro Stocks here in New England considered Super Late Models?
739 2018-12-02 12:30:09 Yeah much better of course but I don’t trust mutual funds because more than 90% of funds don’t beat the market average + they have fees (some hidden fees) and disadvantages such cash drag and inability to buy small cap stocks. Might as well buy government bonds with most of the..

897 2018-12-02 08:43:06 In the next 15 years, we will see people owning more crypto assets than stocks. 
898 2018-12-02 08:42:55 Just the kind of people we want to make stocks and homes cheaper.
899 2018-12-02 08:42:35 It has already taken toll on auto industry, stocks  .. may extent to housing - may lead lower consumption of commodities across value chain --
900 2018-12-02 08:41:16 Having caught up on #School, I can’t understand why every single Government bod at the DfE hasn’t resigned and taken themselves to the village green to sit in stocks.

908 2018-12-02 08:30:33 MBS or Saudi delegate just dropped the bomb that they’ll cut oil production, Mnuchin is happy cause his oil stocks will go up, Trump is pissed that he posted his ridiculous MBS cheerleading tweet & Ivanka is wondering why she didn’t marry a rich Saudi prince instead of Jared.
909 2018-12-02 08:23:42 Many of the people who have attended the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas may support the 2nd Ammendment, but I dare you to tell the friends and family of the 58 murder victims from last year that bump stocks (and machine guns) should be available to any "citizen".
910 2018-12-02 08:23:29 Markets Technology and Infrastructure Strategist...  I dunno do no stock prognostication... you could become a billionaire by just consistently picking the opposite of my guesses on stocks. 
911 2018-12-02 08:18:29 IMO major disadvantage of investors globally is knowing the yrly highs & lows for the stocks they love , this is how they get into major problems. One needs to keep all these things at arms length to have the correct perspective. In stocks love & familiarity leads to disaster.
912 2018-12-02 08:18:24 This is a business news emergency broadcast. The Politics Advocates are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  RL stocks. Thank you for tuning into  CNBC.
913 2018-12-02 08:18:00 GM stocks by the rich might of gone up temporarily, but I'm sure there sales will go down, specially after closing American plants down and opening new ones in Mexico and firing there workers be for Christmas
914 2018-12-02 08:17:59 Brenna, I have followed you for quite some time, and have agreed with or cheered many of the statements made by you.  I cannot  however, sit quietly as you make the claim that any "citizen" should have the right to own bump stocks or even fully-automatic weapons.
915 2018-12-02 08:17:46 All have NFL traits though. I'm just predicting they want a year of increased workload to improve their respective stocks.
916 2018-12-02 08:17:36 Hahaha true! I thought that 40++ articles  was huge already but then 60++ came then now its 80+++ Are we dealing with stocks return? Coz Taehyung is going nowhere but up!!! All roi reaping good harvest 
917 2018-12-02 08:14:41 But the thing is that you can't really defend bump stocks effectively.  They serve no valuable purpose except to give Dems yet another thing to point at.  Probably exactly why Trump is giving it to them.
918 2018-12-02 08:13:35 “My basic philosophy is: Expose your portfolio to the best stocks that the market has to offer and cut your losses very quickly when you’re wrong. That one sentence essentially describes my strategy.” – @markminervini
919 2018-12-02 08:13:22 Maybe @GatewayDirt should consider adding a street/pro stock division next year. Or even a big block modified sanction to get the 10in open mod tires off that surface. Or hold an IMCA stocks & mods invitational the week before. Get some racing on that dirt before the big show.

941 2018-12-02 07:39:44 Me neither.
Like I gave ya 10 bucks, you put in 90 and started a shop, made 200 after a year, I get back 20. That’s my simple understanding of stocks. But how are these coins are priced / evaluated, isn’t something I could comprehend
942 2018-12-02 07:39:39 Most AR PDW stocks are shit when you put aside looks and consider durability and ergo (interferes with selector when collapsed, etc). The only exceptions may be the more integrated ones like the Honey Badger, but idk.

947 2018-12-02 07:23:46 Are you dumb? This is their sales tactic, To artificially deflate stock to increase demand and price like really this is stocks 101.
948 2018-12-02 07:22:04 I have already made a dummy portfolio of $15 billions (or 1,05000 crs rupees) for fiis on 29th Oct at an average price of 10200 for Nifty. The same could be applied on large cap Indian stocks.
949 2018-12-02 07:19:03 Situation is bad am working on this survey in rural shops and tell you most are not stocking sanitary pads and for those with stocks sales are on their all time lowest. Wonder how the girl child is surviving
950 2018-12-02 07:16:57 I like @matt_levine ‘s theory that crypto finance is slowly reinventing everything regular finance did ages ago. If you follow that, ICOs are basically destined to settle in as the equivalent of the pink sheets / penny dreadful stocks which have been around for decades

956 2018-12-02 07:04:24 Remainers appear to know the price of everything and the value of nothing, Glostermeteor. What value/price should we put on sovereignty, control of our own borders and our own laws, and the protection of our own fish stocks?
957 2018-12-02 07:02:10 Currently there are  drilling projects off the eastcoast of Canada. Hibernia has been operating for awhile now and there are others. What is really troubling about all these projects is the effect on marine life especially fish stocks!

960 2018-12-02 06:49:18 Put the attacker and film crew in stocks with their families for 48 hours and put the footage on Social Media.

983 2018-12-02 06:17:19 'Privatizing SS' just means the govt is exploiting the fact that returns to stocks are higher than returns to Treasury debt. It would entail the US govt holding a large amount of shares in private companies. Why would Republicans be for this?

1012 2018-12-02 05:36:53 Correct bhai. Learnt from NBFC panic. One thing I have learnt/ done is to move money from one stock to another within NBFC space. When we know a particular sector well, don't just leave it in panic. Shift money with in the sector to fundamentally strong stocks.

1035 2018-12-02 05:16:50 DTC holdings and bitcoin private keys are completely different ecosystems. For you to say that NAVs and shares outstanding would be sufficient to prove holdings is false. That might be the case with stocks and bonds but not bitcoin.

1043 2018-12-02 05:10:13 That's me at the stock market after they told me that the stocks were negative 
1044 2018-12-02 05:09:05 Today was an insane amount of winning for SP500 and oil. I predicted much of this and took a lot of heat for my predictions. The Iran flare up was the cherry on top. That missile and warship is going to help with my oil E&P stocks going up. They love middle east tension.

1046 2018-12-02 05:03:37 there’s a cafe event being held in select cafes - where you get a cup holder like that with your order until stocks run out
1047 2018-12-02 05:03:31 Their stocks dropped like what..14% after launch.
They apparently paid off people on Amazon to give them 5 stars.
Handled complaints badly (what was the link they sent people to again?)
Only to have to kill the range less than a year in an embarrased attempt to fix their fuckup
1048 2018-12-02 05:02:46 I should buy all my homies some stocks for Christmas 
1049 2018-12-02 05:02:44 And this time u will need heavy dose of burnol. Plz stocks it before its all gone.
1050 2018-12-02 05:01:08 I think we should bring back the stocks and the pillory and to hell with political correctness
1051 2018-12-02 05:01:01 Hope you hit it big in the stock market with all the corporate buy backs.— but check out crypto man, another bull coming soon. It’s the future of money. Or short stocks and get rich. Then you can afford to get sick! Cheers man. Have a good night.
1052 2018-12-02 04:59:40 Since the USA owes a lot of money borrowed from China, Trump does that so that the Chinese stocks go down and lose value and the USA is at a powerful position
1053 2018-12-02 04:58:44 If you buy stocks do you get the prisoners in them too
1054 2018-12-02 04:58:41 Stocks are one hell of a drug , deadass be making money while spending money 
1055 2018-12-02 04:57:03 Invest in stocks instead
1056 2018-12-02 04:56:06 @SEBI_India 
I am retail investor since 78-79, wish to know from SEBI & NSE Managements, stocks Suzlon (5), JP Associate (7) & RCom (13) are very beaten up on a/c of non-performance with huge debt position in their balance sheet, but market regulator still allowed to trade in FNO
1057 2018-12-02 04:54:55 You can work with most stocks, one way or the other, but it's not currently one of mine so I can't help you. Ultimately Pfizer is Pfizer, so I'm sure they'll be fine no matter what. It's like asking if Alabama will play well. I mean... It's Alabama.
1058 2018-12-02 04:54:41 Nagpapatulong friends ko mag-invest sa stocks/bonds/mutual funds HAHA teka lang, ipapasa ko muna 122 HAHAHA
1059 2018-12-02 04:53:44 Truce ang US at China trade. Bullish na ba? Magkakaroon ba ng merry christmas kaming mga investors? hahaha 1 taon na akong ipit. Dina nagmove on mga stocks ko. Nakakaiyak na. hahaha
1060 2018-12-02 04:53:12 The stocks closed at 0.48 % up.

How exactly did it drop, if it went up?
1061 2018-12-02 04:50:02 Nope... They said new stocks r coming on Monday... But what stocks they dnt know...
1062 2018-12-02 04:49:45 “Always been one of the hardest.” In Melee you can take stocks just by flicking down on the c-stick once
1063 2018-12-02 04:49:14 That candy cane sure looks tasty, sweetie. You can come down my chimney any time. *stocks up on candy canes*
1064 2018-12-02 04:48:26 Ohh yeah, of corse Im still in $MDIN and $NHPI $CAVR and $FTEG The FOUR HORSEMEN of stocks right now, but $GMER and $SHMP are future runners.. Lots of good stocks out there and diversification is great if they're all  winners, and these are all long term winners.. IMO
1065 2018-12-02 04:46:29 Well just short? Or trade stocks and commodities.
1066 2018-12-02 04:46:10 Yes when I will be doing what I love to do.... stocks and books .
1067 2018-12-02 04:44:40 So the gist is - "Longer term, you’re much better off using a contrarian strategy that selects from the group of stocks with the worst five-year price appreciation from both All Stocks and Large Stocks."

Thanks for the share..much appreciated.
1068 2018-12-02 04:44:24 If #Bitcoin is a measurement of liquidity in the stock market, then shouldn’t #BTC be up a lot more than 4K, since 99% of Fintwit says stock market going to be up big Monday? Either stock market isn’t going to be up much, or BTC doesn’t have a relationship at all to tech stocks.
1069 2018-12-02 04:43:40 apple stocks rise by 35%.
1070 2018-12-02 04:43:20 It’s 3 stocks now smh
1071 2018-12-02 04:40:56 Any idea which tech stocks to buy Monday?
1072 2018-12-02 04:39:49 Amusing they’ll get it in 20y stat by 2028 with ~5% returns next decade!

20 year stat currently has this for total growth years 1-10: -20%.

Stocks could go sideways for 10y and this stat goes up.

This stat can’t do anything but rise soon, short of 3rd giant decline since 2000.
1073 2018-12-02 04:38:12 Stocks buffeted by risk of Fed mistake & tariffs. Fed is backing off - will be clear soon. Tariffs less destabilizing the more they’re spread out (time to move supply chains). 3 mos of defending RMB = 3 more mos of China R.E. mkt deterioration. In 3-4m U.S. stronger, China weaker
1074 2018-12-02 04:37:40 sitting in a shed smoking a blunt listening to 2 tards argue about stocks and bonds
1075 2018-12-02 04:36:27 pretty messy but who cares? at least I have choc stocks and thats enough 
1076 2018-12-02 04:33:03 So you want to restrict a company from buying back stocks unless they pay workers a certain amount. So if a company wants to buy out of the stock market and go private they must pay workers x. I would give a hard pass. 

I do find that 150x to be interesting though...
1077 2018-12-02 04:32:30 I was doing stocks fno, never successful. when I switched to cash with same strategy/TA, doing little better. i tried to find the reason. with lot of efforts, time and money spent (losses), i realalised that its nothing to do with TA, but it was ALL psychology.
1078 2018-12-02 04:30:58 More like stocks now. Not buying on what you’ve done but instead you’re buying and predicting a profit in production with each investment. Players are slowly no longer selling themselves low
1079 2018-12-02 04:29:46 Market will stop falling until sometime in Feb, so sell your stocks when market rebounds 10%. Move $ from 401 to IRA to control it better, if u can. Good luck everyone. We'll have a very long way to fall after Feb.

1081 2018-12-02 04:27:11 In larger Mcap ASX Resource Stocks, charts wise SFR:ASX will have maximum upsides percentage over next 5/6 years compared to other stocks like RIO, BHP, OZL. Right now not able to judge what will be the triggers for that, but looking for an entry point on downsides over 2019.
1082 2018-12-02 04:26:50 And its not like that money is lying fallow. That capital is at work being invested in stocks and bonds and venture capital.. And often these very rich give to smart charities. Like Melinda Gates and Dustin Moskovitz and Warren Buffett.
1083 2018-12-02 04:25:13 Anyway, doesn’t this just mean stocks were overpriced in 1998?
1084 2018-12-02 04:25:11 the SEC will decide. on ICO and Bitcoin, can future contracts save Bitcoin and the entire Crypto market? Is it possible for stock market investors to jump to Crypto when stocks are on the decline?
1085 2018-12-02 04:23:14 Some payments were as low as $25 — USDA hands out billions to farmers every year to keep USA food stocks supplied for 44 days — the only nefarious POTUS angle is a corner during a 2019 drought. Oats lead the sector says Glen Ring
1086 2018-12-02 04:22:13 Just a timeout to shore up stocks and tend to EU trade (gotta avoid auto tariffs), NK & possibly the Mueller nonsense. Assuming RMB stability is part of the deal, China won’t be able to stimulate to halt the rot domestically. Trump will lower the boom on them in 3-4 months.
1087 2018-12-02 04:21:53 China did the Presidick a favor Stocks loss all 2018 Gains.
1088 2018-12-02 04:21:18 RIO:ASX may head back upward to 200 DEMA at 76.79 AUD but over medium term will have a steep drop , long way to go down over 2019 IMO . I do not short stocks but this is surely a  strong shorting candidate at 77 AUD levels.
1089 2018-12-02 04:18:24 Chitomanyai panaAngwa while stocks last. Oro before Mrehwa vakwidza prices coz of huge demand
1090 2018-12-02 04:12:25 As you said my dear friend !

So, buy stocks as long as you live !!


1091 2018-12-02 04:12:22 probably could have held out longer by drawing down stocks and paying above market for the available soybeans.   and US certainly gains if China lifts the tariff (for a bit) as any sales with the tariff would have been at a discount to Brazil so still required a price concession
1092 2018-12-02 04:11:37 y'all r arguing about bump stocks? I'm a #2A purist and I believe that's the libertarian and conservative position. This is something we generally have in common
1093 2018-12-02 04:09:51 Short Textile related companies, and countertrade automotive industries on Monday with above tight stop losses. The other option is to wait and see how the market reacts to the succession of NAFTA as smart money will be the best indicator of how this will affect stocks short-term
1094 2018-12-02 04:09:15 Bump stocks are not registered or serialized. Theres no way to enforce this.
1095 2018-12-02 04:09:07 Our data has shown that multi-bagger stocks have given enough time to research.
1096 2018-12-02 04:08:46 One of the key aspect in my investment process is to buy stocks of companies which have done well over the past 10 years, rather than companies which we can ONLY HOPE TO DO BETTER IN FUTURE BECAUSE OF A GENERAL THEME.
1097 2018-12-02 04:07:44 This old, bootlicker, stubborn man! How dare he belittle me with his insulting words. I'll teach that scoundrel a lesson by putting him in the stocks until noon. No for the whole day! #lockhimup #Learwillpay #waragainstlear

1102 2018-12-02 04:02:15 @GuyAdami hey guy it’s me Amir I hope you had a wonderful thanksgiving with family. I do have a quick question to ask. I bought amzn and Tesla when they dipped and now that we had a great g20 summit with trump delaying tariffs do you think these are two stocks I should keep now.
1103 2018-12-02 03:58:26 $spx..I guess I just have to "react" on Monday. But is the tariff news bullish or bearish? I still think good looking charts like MXIM and NXPI are the way to go, especially on small stocks like SPPI.
1104 2018-12-02 03:58:02 I can understand that. Stick with what you know, and be profitable your way! Nothing wrong with that! My specific bent is both calls and puts. I don't venture far from just a couple stocks a week, as I profit either direction. Thanks for sharing!
1105 2018-12-02 03:55:07 I have mortgaged all my stocks with a bank in order to lock them for 20-30 years. Hence, I can't sell them in any circumstance
1106 2018-12-02 03:53:29 Do you know how those indexes are made? Poor performers are removed and replaced... it's a top performers list, not a fiscal thermometer.

They corporations took the billions is tax cuts and bought their own stocks, causing those numbers, while we cut bailout checks to farmers...

1114 2018-12-02 03:39:58 Can someone fucking teach me how to invest and buy stocks and shares. Tired of being broke out here DAMN!!
1115 2018-12-02 03:39:55 Man, all these China-related stocks that have been just been awful for the last 6 months or so are going to rip! (My guess is things like casinos, industrials, Apple...)
1116 2018-12-02 03:39:38 sorry bro - you think Trump or anyone in America cares about freedom of the press? They elected a media attacking monster who has somehow turned the majority of US media outlets into untrusted laughing stocks.  Not looking bright for you ;( sorry.
1117 2018-12-02 03:36:34 Stocks are primed to rally Monday after U.S. and China avert a trade crisis.
1118 2018-12-02 03:34:04 I think they do stocks exchange. Aside from that,  donations coming from the oligarchs, politicians, and the churchgoers. Di lang natin alam kung may ilegal pang pinanggagalingan.

1121 2018-12-02 03:32:33 "bump stocks, the tools that make some guns act like semi-automatic weapons."
Nice edit to remove Pistol to Some Guns. You need to learn how guns work.  Bump stocks allow Semi-Automatic rifles to simulate automatic fire by using recoil to pull the trigger much faster than normal.
1122 2018-12-02 03:32:32 Stocks are scam.
Gold is scam.
USD is scam.

Anything that is money in this world is scam.
1123 2018-12-02 03:31:52 The moment she realized that Congress has a “good for thee, but not for me” attitude on a number of issues. Wait until she finds out she can trade stocks on non-public legislative knowledge...
1124 2018-12-02 03:31:15 Two things:  a lot of hedge funds have taken heavy losses in energy and tech stocks during Q3.  Generally hedge fund investors need to give a notice period to withdraw money, a lot of those periods are coming to an end now so those funds have stuff that they have to liquidate.
1125 2018-12-02 03:31:01 Sounds right. Lamb makes me ill, but i make it for Wife and co. I honestly make most stocks the same. Add water, put in oven at 205 overnight, add veg and whatevs for an hour in AM, strain.

1127 2018-12-02 03:29:22 the word from China reportedly looks like Electronics Chipmaker deals/mergers on the way, but this is a constant thing with them and Japan anyways. Tech stocks winner/losers ahead as a result?

1131 2018-12-02 03:24:51 A bunch are muji, because whenever im in NYC I stock up!! and then a bunch of European ones because my mom stocks up for me when she travels. but then the rest are just ones I thought were VERY pretty lol
1132 2018-12-02 03:23:43 Someone has to, my stocks of gold and cow have been depreciating. I might have to sell my liver just to keep my summer home in the alps.
1133 2018-12-02 03:21:42 Alex.  Did you know that Aldi is asking all charities if they want all left over stocks of food stuff just before Christmas holidays. They are giving it to charities. You have to contact Aldi to let them know before the date and you have to be able to collect.  Pass it on please.
1134 2018-12-02 03:20:59 I made $340 in stocks. Nvax has gone up to $2.07 so it's going to $0.08 since I talked to you
1135 2018-12-02 03:18:36 Today smokes   since deep stocks .
1136 2018-12-02 03:18:31 It would be a good analogy if conservatives advocated taking away the bumb stocks of others but concealed their own.  

Since they advocate the exact opposite of that, it's a terrible analogy.
1137 2018-12-02 03:18:01 At least 5, by my count (stocks, real estate, auto loans, student loans, housing again)
1138 2018-12-02 03:17:36 Still a long ways to go to look at 500 charts :-), but my guess is the market will continue to go up early next week. 

Planning to look at gappers (+/-5%) and oversold/overbought stocks, and build a watch list for swings, favoring hot sectors.
1139 2018-12-02 03:17:23 Dear @watsonsmy , i live at Bintulu Sarawak, please add MEDIHEAL x BTS stocks, we need it.
1140 2018-12-02 03:16:12 Although college is a scam, the majority of people don’t understand how money works.  Which as an investor, I actually make more money when people don’t understand money. I make money off of ignorance. I tell homies all the time they smoke weed while I trade weed stocks.

1146 2018-12-02 03:10:38 Thots evading taxes, while supporting taxation is hypocritical

Conservatives getting arrested for having bumps stocks after voting in a man who was supposed to "protect" them is naive

Not really the same thing is it?

1149 2018-12-02 03:06:06 Ok, ya, very well written article. Had I read this some 6 months ago, I probably would not have been as adverse to penny stocks as I am now. 

Good work!
1150 2018-12-02 03:06:05 YouTube thinks i really want to day trade stocks.  Ha ha ha
1151 2018-12-02 03:05:48 don’t ow if you know but you can delete apps you don’t use like stocks, Apple TV, etc.
1152 2018-12-02 03:05:06 So Pauline mentioned nothing of bump stocks and cons, and her response to "victimless crimes" has nothing to do with what u and I are discussing.

I understand now where the idea of comparing the 2 came from, u cleared that up. I just don't think it's a good comparison

1154 2018-12-02 03:03:41 What is the purpose of privatizing social security besides religious belief in superiority of market choices? The government can put all those savings in a broad portfolio of American stocks just fine, if you legislate it so.
1155 2018-12-02 03:00:44 Huh...they stole our patents and @POTUS knows this ,so why the backpeddaling... ?/
1156 2018-12-02 02:58:49 Savings accounts are now losing accounts due to loss of purchasing. People put their wealth in stocks and other asset classes in an effort to preserve their wealth.

1157 2018-12-02 02:58:00 I'd call a local glazier, I think bunnos only stocks fence-grade stuff you cant cut
1158 2018-12-02 02:57:31 Chinese stocks will be up a lot like weeeeeeeed stocks. Watch out!!!!!
1159 2018-12-02 02:54:04 Trade truce will cause stocks to scream higher on Monday. 
Once again the ZH crowd is wrong.   @ZeroHedge1
1160 2018-12-02 02:51:58 No. Just stocks, but it’s the same pain
1161 2018-12-02 02:49:54 Not the best deal but at least a soft deal . Better than nothing . Let’s hope good Monday for all stocks ( specially for Chinese ones ) 
1162 2018-12-02 02:49:12 No escalation, no resolution in line with expectations to better than feared. Good for soybeans not bad for US stocks. Refocus on Fed and Brexit.
1163 2018-12-02 02:47:17 And you can now trade stocks on insider information which means you too will never leave congress.  System blows!!
1164 2018-12-02 02:47:04 Guys I ordered a bit late. And it said no stocks anymore. Is there gonna be a restock or do I cancel my order?

1167 2018-12-02 02:40:12 It's not about the bump stocks. It's about further taking of rights.
1168 2018-12-02 02:39:28 I cannot find any info concerning NRA's stand on banning bump stocks. I've heard the NRA has sold us out. Since there's no evidence contrary to that, I must believe it. I'm a life time member but will begin looking for another organization that is truly Constitutionally based.

1179 2018-12-02 02:30:30 DT mnuchin kudlow say or tweet whatever to keep stocks afloat to get ‘good grade’ so they dont get blamed whenhits fan. Note he been tryna shift blame to Fed since i bet he knows the crash is coming soon which is why Fed did 180 on rates out of no where so they dont get blamed.
1180 2018-12-02 02:29:21 I don't believe it favors any one. Typically wealthy people hold their wealth in real estate, stocks, and other assets.
1181 2018-12-02 02:29:20 This seems much better and bullish news for market from tariffs perspective and hoping my tech stocks spike on monday. $aapl $twtr $zs $msft
1182 2018-12-02 02:28:53 Fuck the NRA. I want legal machines guns and they're out here okay with banning bump stocks

1187 2018-12-02 02:24:37 Just have to release news for that xmas stocks rally lol
1188 2018-12-02 02:24:24 just in general, like FX, stocks, commodities ?
1189 2018-12-02 02:23:50 Yes, thanks - that’s why the Chinese are out in front. They have consistently said “come sit here we’ll work it out” and the Pres is giving them another go. 

But if a deals not done stocks in Jan could get interesting 
1190 2018-12-02 02:21:06 It makes no sense to me either, bump stocks waste ammo and decrease accuracy.
1191 2018-12-02 02:18:57 China wins at the G-20. There was no immediate US confirmation of the outcome of the talks, but  Chinese state TV said: "No additional tariffs will be imposed after  January 1, and negotiations between the two sides will continue." #Stocks #Tariffs #TradeWar #G20 #China

1194 2018-12-02 02:16:14 Could be a squeeze of epic proportions. Chinese stocks gap up and the shorts with margin calls
1195 2018-12-02 02:16:13 Banning bump stocks is still an infringement of inalienable rights. There is no right to pay taxes.

1198 2018-12-02 02:15:11 Doesn’t match comments of Brit Pharmaceutical Ind CEO Mike Thompson. ‘Companies planning since day one’, ‘working closely with gov’, ‘since Chequers noticeable step up in no deal planning with govt’. ‘Members built additional stocks at govt request, now in ‘much better position.’
1199 2018-12-02 02:14:57 Start with Republican party leadership in control of legislation that is unwilling to ban weapons of mass destruction which is the 1st choice of weaponry used by mass shooters. Ban on Bump Stocks is not enough. NRA owns Republican party leadership #VoteThemOut 2020

1203 2018-12-02 02:10:21 Hi @YuanTalks are you sure on undo?

That would imply the US & China are both going to cancel or reverse current tariffs

If that’s the case I’m going to very busy tomorrow morning buying Aussie, Copper, stocks & anything else hit by the trade war cause that’s an end not a truce

1206 2018-12-02 02:07:35 I am not saying that you can't make money trading garbage sub-penny and penny stocks. I'm urging you to study and learn the patterns/what makes them move/why they WILL crash/volume and history. Don't follow the twitter amateur pumpers alerts "EVER". The market will crush you.

1214 2018-12-02 01:53:58 Common stocks uncommon profits by Phillip Fisher. He inadvertently tells you how to run a successful business by telling you the things he is looking for in a business. Implemented a ton from that book and have never looked back.
1215 2018-12-02 01:53:23 It’s not about bump stocks (regardless of the covered or not covered). It’s about the language they are using, which is extremely broad and/or the legal precedence that the overall ban would open up. 

(On another note, Banning accessories is still infringement)
1216 2018-12-02 01:52:30 I’m such a nerd. No one wants to talk about stocks with me 
1217 2018-12-02 01:51:06 Shorten is beyond gutless and graceless. He abandons anyone or cause which might mar his ride to power.If only he realised it some courage around #climatechange would improve his stocks.

1222 2018-12-02 01:46:13 Anyway you slice it, this is a gift for bears. Economy is still rolling over with or without tariffs (and stocks shouldn’t be at/near ath when that’s the case). 

1. Stocks soaring and being chased until it stalls and people realizes it didn’t fix anything

2. They fall apart...
1223 2018-12-02 01:45:55 Really inimidating, little buddy.  

Pity most of your sheep are ice addicts and drunks.

Most "celebrities" become laughing stocks after they achieve fame, Blah.

1227 2018-12-02 01:40:50 I am for the 2nd amendment and the Constitution. I’m aware that gun violence is out of control but I know taking the weapons away from the good guys who just hunt and protect their homes will never help. It will just make criminals more violent. Bump stocks can go but I’m pro gun
1228 2018-12-02 01:39:47 With bump stocks. Oy, the hypocrisy. 
1229 2018-12-02 01:39:42 With markets we all could buy stocks. But this brings up another point. What % of people were wise enough and patient enough to do that? Prob same amount as crypto? So most people still left out...
1230 2018-12-02 01:39:08 Ie Apple is a stock portfolio with 6-10 stocks. Amazon has 100+. Even if Amazon makes individual bets that are riskier than an individual one of Apple’s, overall risk is less because it’s diversified
1231 2018-12-02 01:37:34 Well unless you want to wait in a long line, you might have to preorder it from a store before you go. Maybe look at google maps for Best Buy’s or any other store that stocks around where you are going to go...good luck!
1232 2018-12-02 01:36:32 I don’t always agree with some of the things that Trump does for example I’m a #2A supporter. And with him banning bump stocks isn’t right. Also I just like flipping you shit & your pretty good sport about it & I dig that .
1233 2018-12-02 01:34:14 World growth = oil growth. I don't care who grows. I just don't want fighting which is a waste. We need the trade war to end and then growth will occur everywhere. I'm just looking for the oil demand picture so my shale stocks will do fine.

1237 2018-12-02 01:31:12 Very bearish Financial and banking stocks. Deep financial concerns JP Morgan & Chase and others. Expect,,layoffs in mortgage lending divisions and loan departments. Also,,concerns regarding holdings in mortgage collateralized loans, as housing (prices) markets continues falling.

But Twitter was $31.38 at the end of July and as I write now on Saturday it's $31.45.
I'd hardly say its "tanking" because of anything much less conservatives bailing on the stock. It's not.

1245 2018-12-02 01:20:33 I'm surprised they didn't mention chicken necks & backs. They are super cheap, and they give stocks tons of body. You do have to do some searching for them though. I get mine from kosher grocery store that breaks down whole chickens.
1246 2018-12-02 01:19:53 Sounds like a good news especially for aapl and Chinese stocks
1247 2018-12-02 01:19:36 If China gets Trump to announce he's backing off though, that would be the surprising news that should have a major effect on stocks.

1287 2018-12-02 00:27:02 Jackson, I have been trading stocks for 30 years. The XRP people are exactly the same as the people I wasted my time arguing with on AOL and Yahoo chat boards in the early 90's. Its a waste of time. Eventually they lose their money and go  away.  They never appreciate advice.
1288 2018-12-02 00:23:05 Hey @RobinhoodApp I’m not receiving any of my referral stocks 
1289 2018-12-02 00:22:55 Wooooo @bananaramajam this is GREAT news for our stocks.
1290 2018-12-02 00:22:14 Is there a complimentary Stocks project?

1292 2018-12-02 00:20:32 Walt Disney gave his housekeeper stocks every year for the holidays, and she died a multi-millionaire.
1293 2018-12-02 00:19:24 Reason I trade 500 to 1k shares allows me to enter 2 or even 3 times on lower priced stocks. So if one doesn't work, I didn't go all in with shares and now cash is tied up for 2 days. Hope all this helps.
1294 2018-12-02 00:19:24 Thinking about investing in stocks 
1295 2018-12-02 00:19:06 Do you know what a dividend is? In regards to stocks, it's definition is income. Mitt Romney, Warren Buffet, etc. make a living, almost exclusively on stock dividends.

1297 2018-12-02 00:18:39 It’s simple : #Bitcoin was made as #WallStreet 2.0 

#SatoshiNakamoto is just a name,but was created by them,the big&smart money

When a crisis begin - economy is blocked

So how to make money when when #stocks will crash ?

There’s $BTC #crypto

1299 2018-12-02 00:18:12 I'm not really sure why people get involved with sub-penny stocks like $MDIN that have had random volume. No catalyst/no news just hearsay. Learn to trade according to %gainers/catalysts/price action/past history/predictable patterns.If U pick random trades, expect random results
1300 2018-12-02 00:16:36 So, I'm guessing you don't travel abroad, don't own property, don't have stocks or shares, and don't eat food that isn't produced within the UK. Because all of those things will be affected by a no-deal Brexit.

1329 2018-12-01 23:30:42 Here’s my best guess given the news over past few days: Trump & Xi bullshit show causes stocks to rally in early wk, namely Chinese Tech on US exchange ( $BABA $BIDU $NVDA etc). Then later in week things get hairy. Keep in mind Wednesday now closed. Smh sorry but that’s annoying.

1350 2018-12-01 23:27:57 The punters always want action now. Unfortunately it can take time for potential offshoot projects to become obvious.

It does show that there are new geological systems in this country that will ultimately spark a revival in smaller stocks.

Give it time and think laterally
1351 2018-12-01 23:27:56 Do you or anyone know a pet shop that stocks this in South London?
1352 2018-12-01 23:27:38 Amigos, eu não sei e não posso falar nada sobre essa negociação do Botafogo. A informação que tenho é a que foi postada, aqui no twitter, com a grande cobertura do @IamLipSouza. 

Assim como o Botafogo, o Vasco também agiu no mercado e contratou Stocks e Caio Torres. #NBB
1353 2018-12-01 23:27:24 According to the news a couple of days ago bump stocks are being banned. I'm not sure what the effective date of the ban is.
1354 2018-12-01 23:26:35 Btw, all fractionalization and lending practices are approved by clients of custodians. It’s true for stocks, ETFs, bonds, commodities, etc... they either, 1. like the extra return, 2. don’t care enough or 3. don’t read their contracts. (Or some combination of the 3)
1355 2018-12-01 23:25:41 Good November as well for the Canadian #PermanentPortfolio. All components up nicely for a monthly return of +1.72%.

Bear market forced me to study and learn #TA, #MoneyManagement, and #SelfDiscpline, and, most importantly, got me closer to my dad as I seek his guidance rather than try and impress him (he trades stocks for 30+ years).

1362 2018-12-01 23:22:07 Is that why my liquor stocks are down?
1363 2018-12-01 23:21:53 Well the most tax avoidance and cheating is done by those who do own their own business. Also is a CEO not a salaried job? And they get paid obscene amounts of money. The line you are trying to draw is very blurry. Most people have to manage their own capital
 Eg. through stocks
1364 2018-12-01 23:21:28 Yes, thats correct. Both stocks lost more than 50% value though
1365 2018-12-01 23:21:28 If a long/short hedge fund liquidates they don’t give investors their stocks back. Would have to imagine they liquidate over the course of a few months to try to get best price possible without moving market in a fire sale.

1375 2018-12-01 23:12:56 Public shaming works.  the stocks are extreme but the concept is sound. She wanted to be recorded for posterity and to feel big and tough. Let’s see her handle the “fame”.
1376 2018-12-01 23:11:46 Aside from your word salad that is barely understandable, jobs are disappearing under Trump. The Republican tax plan handed billion to companies to buy back stocks and then incentivises companies to move off-shore.
1377 2018-12-01 23:09:46 US  markets are seemingly in an uptrend again .I would expect at some point another reversal to retest or exceed the 2018 lows before the real bull market reasserts sometime in 2019.

That's my broad future outlook. My strategy is patience and don't give up on stocks
1378 2018-12-01 23:08:57 We are moving quickly because salmon stocks are in crisis. The plan is that we are able to get these issues into Spring budget and legislative calendar. BCr’s consider salmon as sacred as Quebecers consider French. The time to act was years ago. The next best time is now

1383 2018-12-01 23:00:48 I know for a fact that one motivation was to avoid a CHF effect, i.e. to have the Deutsche Mark strengthen because of flight capital inflows, hurting German exports. Can you imagine the Bundesbank having to print money to buy U.S. stocks in order to keep the Mark from going up?
1384 2018-12-01 23:00:06 Musta’ been those pink stocks. Frightening!
1385 2018-12-01 22:59:25 I give them a lot of money but with thousands of stocks, I see better investments
1386 2018-12-01 22:59:06 Yeah, @JudgeJeanine FINALLY got something right
FOX and Trump will forevermore be synonymous with Dumkopfs. They are both laughing stocks to most people whose IQs are higher than room temperature
1387 2018-12-01 22:57:13 In days of yore, you're relegated to the stocks for your public shaming.
1388 2018-12-01 22:56:21 I also found a clip of the first story I wrote about the "NETdex," as we called it, which I set up in 1995 as a way to follow the performance of Internet stocks like Netscape and America Online, plus a bunch of ISPs and so on that no longer exist. Netscape had just gone public

1393 2018-12-01 22:52:03 @Summit_UK The most disgusting customer service I have ever come across! If you can’t cope with high volumes of sale stocks then you really should limit to what gets ordered so that customers are not being mislead.  Definitely not buying from you again!
1394 2018-12-01 22:50:05 Wednesday will be national day of mourning for President Bush. Stocks markets will be closed.
1395 2018-12-01 22:50:05 I guess if he were put in the stocks in front of the Capital and people threw rotten tomatoes at him, I would. . . Nah.

1397 2018-12-01 22:47:10 Bitcoin most consistent correlation has nothing to do with financials assets like stocks, the dollar, or gold. Instead, the price moves in tandem with the search term "Bitcoin" in Google Trends. #btc
1398 2018-12-01 22:44:36 STOCKS;  tariffs, trade wars, geo-political problems from a  divided international community caused by trump's attacks resulted in a  global decline in world wealth: 
China stocks - down 21% 
Europe - down 13% 
Gold - down 6% 
Crypto down 70% 
USA - up 2% 
Long-term, very scary

1407 2018-12-01 22:35:17 How long ya'all need? DSG is going strong after their "dumb" decisions to have a age limit on guns and the 2A/NRA folks vowed retaliation/boycott. That was February, sales were up in Q2 and stocks up 20% ytd. When will they be affected ya think??

" Powell’s speech was regarded as dovish. If it actually was, then it was a really bad idea to buy stocks because of it..."
1409 2018-12-01 22:32:50 They look at a couple days when the stocks as a whole had shitty days as confirmation that something they are doing is affecting them. Twitter is up 28% for the year, DSG the other prominently mentioned I saw is only up 20%. Bring the pain MAGAts they said.
1410 2018-12-01 22:30:24 Not listed in Canada - aussie stocks / listed - not included - maybe next time
1411 2018-12-01 22:29:52 Umm take a minute to look em up, stocks up 20% for year, sales in Q2 were up, just 1% but up, not down. I wonder who is dumb.
1412 2018-12-01 22:29:07 What does any of that have to do with day trading small cap stocks?? As far as I know, they never claimed to be experts on any of the topics you mentioned. Doesn’t change the fact that they’re good traders.

1415 2018-12-01 22:27:25 @MacFromTha12 that seminar was so worth the time and filled with more information than I ever knew! We learned enough to want to learn more! Oh yeah, much better trading techniques than stocks!
1416 2018-12-01 22:27:04 How about a size 13? Better get these now! Limited stocks! 
1417 2018-12-01 22:27:02 Biggest mistake teens make when investing...buying stocks and listening to people on t.v. about investing....2 or 3 bad days can and will wipe you out......the big guys will have their money out first. Don't believe  me......good luck!
1418 2018-12-01 22:26:19 Stocks are up
1419 2018-12-01 22:26:03 Just like the twitter stock tank statement. 1/2/18 share price $29.49. 11/30/18 share price 35.98. A not to shabby 21% increase. They are probably saying to the conservatives, NRA etc more pain please. Stocks are long term tracking, a few days/weeks mean little to nothing.
1420 2018-12-01 22:24:23 I have become addicted to the science of investing. Started reading Benjamin Graham’s “Intelligent Investor”. Finished Michele Cagan’s “ Stocks 101” (amazing book)

1429 2018-12-01 22:15:32 Many of the large companies I deal with are unprepared and have not put safety stocks in place in case of disruption in supply from Europe and long leadtimes mean it is now too late

1431 2018-12-01 22:15:06 You're right. I just remembered the previous ban that GW allowed to expire. They also banned the 6 position telestock. What was the point in that? It really wasnt a "ban", just stopped manufacturing that only jacked up prices on available stocks. Stupid liberal logic.
1432 2018-12-01 22:13:48 Usually 3 Wick candles are $24.99 but only one day a year Bath and Body Works has “Candle day” where they are $8.75 so everyone HELLA stocks up

1435 2018-12-01 22:11:22 It’s easy to forget about them when every tech news story is about FAANG stocks. Amazing how much influence the news cycle has. Clearly I’m not the only one surprised here 
1436 2018-12-01 22:10:28 God didn’t take away these jobs.. @realDonaldTrump did with his tariffs & unnecessary trade war... not to mention  his tax cuts for corporations which with that extra money the ceos just bought their own stocks to fill their own pockets. Meanwhile 15,000 employees got pink slips
1437 2018-12-01 22:06:59 It seems to be more combo heavy than sm4sh but I wouldn’t mind 2 stock. I think we should let the first month go by and go from there

Seems like the community wants 3 stocks universally tho

1439 2018-12-01 22:03:39 For now I use @SquawkCNBC .  @StocksToTrade also have this feature included on their platform at no extra cost as well as @EquityFeed.  Why not you guys?
1440 2018-12-01 22:02:54 And imma say this one more time for y’all, start getting into and learning about stocks, that shit WILL pay off
1441 2018-12-01 22:02:29 Stocks are up. National deficit is down. Unemployment at 30 yr. low. Black and hispanic unemployment at all time low. More take home pay for everybody. GDP is up. Etc. If you ain't for that then you're part of the problem NOT Trump.
1442 2018-12-01 22:00:39 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.  私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。１

1444 2018-12-01 21:59:32 6 is definitely too short with 3 stocks
1445 2018-12-01 21:59:23 My wife a few weeks ago for two days was unable to get her prescription fulfilled by her chemist. A run of the mill prescription and not for a life threatening ailment. The suppliers she said were holding back stocks...#Brexit my wife asked, could be said the parmacist.
1446 2018-12-01 21:58:19 It’s dumb lol, ledge hoggin makes more sense and would 1000%. Change meta/make it more face pace.

Then they could have more stocks
1447 2018-12-01 21:57:56 At the dinner table with the in-laws. Conversation just turned to finance  and stocks and shares so I wowed them with my impressive neopets stocks record  #grownup
1448 2018-12-01 21:50:21 Thots support taxation.
Many on the right do not support banning bump stocks.
You may laugh if a conservative in favor of banning bump stocks get charged for having bump stocks.
1449 2018-12-01 21:48:51 By age 30 you should have:

- stocks you bought mainly because you recognized the name
- under $20 worth of Bitcoin
- a credit card you forgot the pin to so you only use it for online shopping 
- vague sense of dread
1450 2018-12-01 21:47:43 Ha ha ha... You must be a Washington beltway never Trumper...  Your 5 best stocks for 2018 (looking at a Dec. 27, 2017 article) have all been a bust!  Glad you are not my financial advisors!!!
1451 2018-12-01 21:47:02 No we don’t currently support FX. We currently support US stocks only and working to add more asset classes next year.
1452 2018-12-01 21:45:21 lol
1453 2018-12-01 21:44:48 BUY STOCKS
1454 2018-12-01 21:42:47 Pretty close.  I wonder though if the panic out of stocks needs to be a bit further along like in both 2000 and 2007 before the dollar falls.  Mostly likely though we don't have much if any upside left, but not sure we're headed down until panic out of tech is certain.
1455 2018-12-01 21:42:10 Invest in yourself & raise your own stocks
1456 2018-12-01 21:41:35 I would like to point out I am enjoying tradenets leverage on these large cap stocks so I have no problem/ill will towards them
1457 2018-12-01 21:40:56 That means Al Gores stocks will go down.
1458 2018-12-01 21:40:08 Yes , they said im 100% hedged, tbh im not not sure what that means and wasnt provided an answer on what the qualifications for being hedged are. I still seem to be unable to trade short other stocks people have been trading. As a result I”m shifting to mostly large cap now.

1467 2018-12-01 21:32:15 This is why stocks are dropping @jack, this will continue!
1468 2018-12-01 21:29:48 Some coins will never bounce back just like some of the stocks on the stock market. Bitcoin has the largest network effect, most amount of supported automated teller machines etc. So it's unlikely that Bitcoin will be one of the losers.
1469 2018-12-01 21:29:19 I'm at least in principle vegan, and I think we're heading for trouble - Tesco stocks exactly four different fresh vegetables 365 days per year. I doubt very much they all come from local growers.

1472 2018-12-01 21:29:03 We still have some days to go till year's end and crypto's are traded 24/7 not as stocks. What's better to get some Cryptos as Christmas gift? 
1473 2018-12-01 21:28:11 No. Nothing wrong with that but I am not that good. I look for bigger moves in stocks and es rty and nq
1474 2018-12-01 21:22:32 It's an important part of the story , 4 instance OZ resource stocks R entirely supported by the RMB ponzi scheme , BHP announced a 15b buy back last week , when the RMB scheme fails resource stocks will collapse because they have a infinite RMB call built into their assumptions

1479 2018-12-01 21:16:56 Bring back village stocks. Let herself & her parents be put in stocks, guaranteed more parents would start taking responsibility for their children's criminality.
1480 2018-12-01 21:15:42 Why your government doesn't invest, but just holds gold in the storage to back up the currency?

Nobody can force anyone to exchange his digital gold for another asset like stocks or bonds for the search of returns. Banks are just inflating the monetary base.
1481 2018-12-01 21:14:57 No doubt the Chinese will buy this asset its to good not to be developed, but they won't  be  buying it for  500m ~MC  it will be more likely  when  holders have had enough of a stagnant beat up share price that's when the cheap offer will come.

 I don't hold any li stocks
1482 2018-12-01 21:14:52 So... all these war mongering politicians and warmongering polticians' spouses who make big bucks by insider trading on MIC stocks... doesn't that make them war profiteers? Isn't that illegal and pretty much a form of treason against the majority of Americans who don't.?
1483 2018-12-01 21:12:56 Xi knows he's overmatched in @realDonaldTrump and the Chinese stocks continue to crash, even though your news organizations try to keep it hidden from your populace.
1484 2018-12-01 21:12:33 U.S. based CBD stocks are about to progress towards major exchanges. Before the farm bill (which just passed), all US weed companies had to keep their money in Canadian holdings which makes it very difficult to be on major exchange.
1485 2018-12-01 21:12:05 3/ Around Christmas of 2017, every client of mine got recommended to sell down their financial assets holdings (stocks & bonds) and either: a) raise cash or b) increase private assets.

Personally, coming into 2018, I was over 60% in alternatives (now even higher).

1491 2018-12-01 21:04:48 Trump banning bump stocks means this administration can no longer talk shit on any other administration for their stance on the 2nd #TheseHandsRatedEforEverybody
1492 2018-12-01 21:02:14 Probably because they're waiting for the gang in charge to ban them from banning bump stocks.

1496 2018-12-01 20:58:00 Interesting always energy stocks
1497 2018-12-01 20:57:19 thats why u invest in stocks RE bonds.  Without inflation there can never be risk taking, leverage and borrowing.  Inflation is way better than deflation! Bitcoin could be an alternative asset class, but play it wisely as of now!
1498 2018-12-01 20:55:48 Okay... lets take a look at some of energy stocks...
1499 2018-12-01 20:54:50 Yes, US stocks performed better in that timeframe. Of course who knows what the future holds.
1500 2018-12-01 20:53:25 When you gotta collab with Ninja to boost ur notoreity and stocks but overhype a fuckin reskin. Oh and US exclusive.
1501 2018-12-01 20:52:58 Lesson for the week: Don’t try stocks that you don’t know. The ones you know will make you the money. $SPX, $SPY, $AMZN and $AAPL
1502 2018-12-01 20:52:46 Should have bought other things instead. Maybe gold, paintings, stocks, diamond, watches. Haha.
1503 2018-12-01 20:51:00 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $CAG, $CPLP, $JEC, $UFS, all may climb w/in 9, 13, 12, 13 days up to 3%, 2.9%, 4.9%, 3.5% respectively 
1504 2018-12-01 20:49:35 Unpopular opinion: while rage and DLC were shit for the game. The game was hot garbage even if you removed them.
Smash 4’s problem was the ability to take stocks early while being too slow to up the stock count, so it was inconsistent trash.
1505 2018-12-01 20:46:46 The ATF has no jurisdiction in regards to bump stocks according to a 2010 letter that they published. If they regulate them now sue them on the grounds that they don’t have jurisdiction

1512 2018-12-01 20:40:23 20,000 fans aren’t showing up for trucks, Mods, Stocks, or plm. Teams are. Wouldn’t have made a diff if those races were ran on Tuesday or Friday or in between. Like I said before, could’ve had everything but the Snowball already ran and done what they needed with that one
1513 2018-12-01 20:39:56 Seasonality trades are of stocks and or sectors that have strength in certain months of the year. Since the 1920s many trade off of these seasonal calendars The ones I choose must be backtested at least 10 yrs with minimum 75% probability
1514 2018-12-01 20:38:50 I trade stocks for a living & teach investments.  This is one stock I’m getting out of & will no longer support or recommend.  I’ll just short it & watch it tank.

1522 2018-12-01 20:31:46 When I more actively traded stocks I watched the housing market to help predict a slow down (classic recession- I call it) and believe it started roll over bout 3 mths ago, with rates headed up it’s not coming out soon.
Not long stocks now but been looking at some puts or shorts

1526 2018-12-01 20:27:49 @realDonaldTrump @potus Banning bump stocks is one of the dumbest things you will have done to date. It will have ZERO impact and it is unenforceable. It’s just political pandering and window dressing. Not to mention the ?legality? of it. The only result will be lost voters.
1527 2018-12-01 20:26:38 @Samaatv_News Show this video to both laughable stocks Abdul Moiz Jafri and his partner. Let them have some shame that @ImranKhanPTI is working so hard for poor and both are making fun by showing that Khursheed Shah video. corrupt politicians supporters. You both most immature!
1528 2018-12-01 20:26:29 Le numérique a multiplié les chaînes de télévision publiques ou privées françaises mais pas les programmes originaux. D'une chaîne à l'autre et d'un mois différent à l'autre c'est sans cesse les mêmes vieux stocks. C'est pas étonnant que le public se tourne vers l'internet
1529 2018-12-01 20:25:44 I use hundreds of strategies when trading stocks. CAN SLIM is a fundamental analysis type strategy. You know how I learned it? I read a 250 page book. I would love to explain it but I wouldn’t be able to do so in less than 250 pages.
1530 2018-12-01 20:25:05 A follower just mentioned how her money goes towards savings. That’s where I was going. IRAs, some stocks, high yield savings, etc. Gotta balance blowing money and responsibility 
1531 2018-12-01 20:25:03 Trump-Xi trade talks could spark 'explosion' higher for stocks like Apple – or lead to a bear market - CNBC
1532 2018-12-01 20:24:23 There was debate over that one because it meant a 4-day weekend for stocks.
1533 2018-12-01 20:23:44 Everyone has been there to practice since Tuesday or Wednesday. The trucks & Mods & Stocks are a local weekly deal. Could’ve had everythingg already ran, aside from the Snowball, and no team would’ve had to change a reservation.
This is pretty smart. I’m not sorry
1534 2018-12-01 20:22:29 Not one ounce of empathy for him. In fact, I wish him the one ill I believe he might be capable of feeling: a forever bruised ego with massive amounts of public humiliation and embarrassment. Something like being put in the stocks while we pelt rotten produce at him sounds apt.

1541 2018-12-01 20:15:31 That's why cyclical stocks corrected for much of this year & why I predicted that the Fed would pause & maybe even ease. It important to understand what's already discounted. Correction is over & market ready to head for new highs.
1542 2018-12-01 20:14:00 I was ready to give Trump credit for banning bump stocks but the company that makes them shut down production on them in May, so...

1548 2018-12-01 20:04:58 Instead of everybody in the house having on Jordan’s, try getting them out of that apartment and teach them lessons that’s more valuable then shoes, only black people are impressed by this bullshit, teach them about stocks,bonds, Ira’s etc, how to budget #WeGottaBreakThaMold
1549 2018-12-01 20:02:56 I've started investing in stocks.  

Beef, chicken and vegetable.

One day I hope to be a bouillonaire.
1550 2018-12-01 20:01:03 Important Date

The last Trading Date for 2018 is Thursday, December 27th.  Stocks purchased or sold after this date will settle in 2019, so any capital gains or losses on sale will apply to the 2019 tax year.
1551 2018-12-01 20:00:06 Any strategy that relies on rules engineered specifically to avoid bear markets in US stocks is necessarily based on a sample size in the single digits.

Those who espouse such methods are encouraged to audit a course in basic statistics, with a particular focus on Type 1 error.

1555 2018-12-01 19:57:58 @jimcramer Should someone be weary of a "service" that suggests stocks for a mere charge of $6,000/year that has to be paid all upfront?
1556 2018-12-01 19:57:02 You could look into initial coin offerings (ICOs), or look into penny stocks for cryptocurrency. Also look at the companies that are supporting the blockchain you are interested in investing into. Disclaimer: I'm not an financial adviser just a person who likes money.
1557 2018-12-01 19:56:15 So many donkey dung comments only prove the stocks are sure to rise on the cost of boots soon 
1558 2018-12-01 19:55:05 Attributed to Will Rogers "...buy stocks that go up. If they don't go up, don't buy them..."
1559 2018-12-01 19:54:55 I was informed of this, in fact. The world of broths and stocks never ceases to amaze me.

1561 2018-12-01 19:53:35 Honestly let's just hope @zd_luigi leaves some stocks for us to take, cause polygon team the big free
1562 2018-12-01 19:52:00 Mind you, the Saudi Royal family is not giving funds as zakat, they are investing in projects in the world fastest growing economy and will get handsome returns.  BTW the Saudi royals the biggest investors in the US stocks too.
1563 2018-12-01 19:51:41 I don't believe that's how it works. When I give stocks to a non profit the stocks have a nominal USD value that I can deduct. That USD value doesn't make it a try event. It isn't my decision to sell or retain the stocks. That's up to them or a hired middle man.
1564 2018-12-01 19:50:23 Twitter stocks are in deep doo-doo... many large investors have expressed concerns.

Time to select a Globalist and put him in the public stocks, run him out on a rail, or across the pond, plant him in Molenbeck with a message that he blasphemed or burnt the Koran.

1573 2018-12-01 19:41:59 Jim, I find myself in too many Mutual Funds between mad many, IRA, And 401K. Stay the Course? Sell and move what I can to stocks? Sell and move to S&P index?
1574 2018-12-01 19:40:03 Assigning cause & affect over one week period when 60 to 80pct of stocks are traded by algorithms suggests you completely understand what & how the algos are pricing. Dangerous game, IMO.

1578 2018-12-01 19:39:25 If you didn't think you'd be able to find healthy doses of stocks trading near cash as markets become "supposedly" more efficient over time, look harder. Some boring, seemingly dead, #microcaps are just camping out waiting for their catalyst to arrive. #Crash2Cash @NanoCapIdeas
1579 2018-12-01 19:38:25 Do you believe that it was fiscally responsible to get our country in further debt in order to give the billionaire class more $$ to buy more stocks and private jets?  Economy historically is better when Dems are in charge.
1580 2018-12-01 19:38:02 My calls were dead on. If people listened to me they made money. The problem is many of them were YT channels, who couldn't be bothered to run a simulator. World of difference between a novice and a person who started in stocks with companies like Tesla back in 2012.
1581 2018-12-01 19:33:58 Powell specifically said he would be watching economic and financial data going forward. I interpret financial data to be stocks and credit spreads. So my forecast of what Fed does at December meeting will depend on how stocks and credit spreads trade over next 11 business days.

1583 2018-12-01 19:33:10 Strange things have happened in this cesspool of the otcbb/pink sheet stocks. I’ve seen bloated 5 billion share floats run from .0001 to pennies. It’s the Wild West / casino playing these things. Who knows you might get your money back on this one? We can dream right? Lol $GDAR
1584 2018-12-01 19:32:52 Great read and watch! During these last several weeks when the media has made everyone nervous about owning stocks it’s good to read your unbiased opinion on the markets. Both stocks and bonds. Your charts don’t lie. Thanks for sharing.

1587 2018-12-01 19:30:00 Only thing that makes America weak is the alt-leftist democratic party & their blocking of anything that benefits the American ppl. Watch, as already started since taking congress, stocks fell & businesses closing before dems close them down & job losses are just  beginning!!
1588 2018-12-01 19:28:01 one has to be careful here its still not DXY runnaway and it doesnt mean USD goes up so will DOW its not 1995 2000 the dynamics are totally different this time. the correlations are breaking  .one can have HIGH dollor with lower UST and lower stocks

1591 2018-12-01 19:23:57 Well in reality you’re not up 20% on those 2 stocks smart ass!! You could possibly be over the entirety of your portfolio; however, that would only be true if you aren’t using a mutual fund designated by your financial advisor. Don’t pretend to knows stocks it’s an ugly look!
1592 2018-12-01 19:23:38 I agree with the hatch act. 

But passing rules that say "don't say impeachment" while Trump uses Twitter to  campaign and trash stocks of companies he doesn't like violates the spirit of the law.

The impeachment rule is fake oversight. 

And Comey didn't affect election.

1597 2018-12-01 19:21:50 $GDARI’m thinking this is a pump and dump as well. (Like 99% of these otc/pink stocks) I’ll put it on my watchlist and see how this plays out. I owned this one 2/3 years ago - made a small move from .0001-.0006. These stocks have a tendency to make small runs every 2/3 years

Those few stocks have a heavy influences on these indices and should be rebalanced to proper levels.

1615 2018-12-01 19:06:50 You probably enjoy bump stocks still being sold. 520,000 still in circulation but you will find a BS reason the are necessary. You probably "need" an AR 15 like gun to shoot a squirrel. You probably are such an irresponsible gun owners you hang on to "ekkkkk confiscation run"

1634 2018-12-01 18:52:40 There are exactly as many shares as there were before. Exactly the same amount of base money. What changes, regardless of whether stocks are traded or not, is that there is an extra security - the IOU - that is an asset and a liability, as evidence that funds were intermediated.
1635 2018-12-01 18:52:36 Thanks - it's the main reason I haven't done much in bios lately. I need to start looking at "regular" stocks more! But I'm spending my time analyzing after-catalyst trading. Very complicated as there's many permutations of catalyst types/company situations/market reactions, etc.
1636 2018-12-01 18:52:02 What about the huge rally in stocks last week ? Has this improved things ?
1637 2018-12-01 18:51:33 ok
1638 2018-12-01 18:50:54 The sale of bump stocks would be the only thing that's illegal.
1639 2018-12-01 18:46:29 Like Trump stole everything else. And he did. Trump was not in office long enough to make the impact that Obama made. You just want to give credit to someone without merit. That's what you do with Trump. Stocks were already high when he got elected.
1640 2018-12-01 18:46:24 "bump stocks, the tools that make some guns act like semi-automatic weapons."
Nice edit to remove Pistol to Some Guns. You need to learn how guns work.  Bump stocks allow Semi-Automatic rifles to simulate automatic fire by using recoil to pull the trigger much faster than normal.

1651 2018-12-01 18:34:03 Brian - in seriousness, if that is true,  why do professional fund managers usually get outperformed by stocks picked at random by a monkey? Predicting the future is, at best, educated guesswork, not a mathematically solvable calculation.
1652 2018-12-01 18:33:21 Yes I agree. Also, there is a argument to be made with Ar15s being targeted all over the country by states, bump stocks would be used as a talking point to get rid of them all together.

1654 2018-12-01 18:29:18 Banning bump stocks is another one.  How many have been sold? Who will really turn them in?  They were ok under Obama.  @NRA The many are punished for the very very few.

1667 2018-12-01 18:20:43 Should I make a galactic pack v2 with more self made stocks and ccs etc? It will only be like £3
1668 2018-12-01 18:20:42 True stmt but MTUM is probably diff't than what you are used to thinking about for momentum. Of MTUM top 30 holdings, just 3 stocks were sold in the May Re-balance. You are right that much less activity in VTV -- (but then no cap gain announced for MTUM in 2018)
1669 2018-12-01 18:20:23 Me too, hope one of us 2 stocks Squid with Pirahna Plant.
1670 2018-12-01 18:20:10 Yeah I saw someone who said they got two. Why? Unless you're doing a giveaway but I mean just let people buy it for themselves especially since there were limited stocks. Plus that person just looked like a 'normal' person (unless they got it for a friend but they didn't mention)
1671 2018-12-01 18:19:36 @digitalassetbuy Apple Stocks is also showing the correct marketcap of XRP just like yahoo finance..
1672 2018-12-01 18:18:37 hahaha! you got into $xlr at good timing/price, with txbit coming. Could prices go lower for #masternodes? Sure, so make sure to focus on projects with solid dev. Usually I only consider projects with at least 20% yield, as well. Otherwise, for the risk, I'd just invest in stocks
1673 2018-12-01 18:17:28 Hi @B_Gumm she is 84 now so has been at it a while..Currently she trades things like $shop in the US, $V and some pot stocks now since last Christmas like $CGC & $APHA. She sticks to a plan of when to buy and when to sell and trades on fundamentals. She also holds lots of $RY.

1684 2018-12-01 18:12:09 @realDonaldTrump I supported you for the presidency, and I continue to support you today despite the backlash it brings. However, I must speak out when necessary, and it is unmistakably necessary now. I unequivocally condemn your actions towards restricting bump-fire stocks.
1685 2018-12-01 18:11:21 Did anybody in New Jersey have bump stocks in the first place?
1686 2018-12-01 18:10:56 I SCAM RAPPERS TO BUY MY PENNY STOCKS AND SPEND $7 TO REFILL MY TRACFONE
1687 2018-12-01 18:10:23 Oh boy.  BTW, the bump stock ban is about to go into effect. No, bump stocks are not a right.
1688 2018-12-01 18:10:15 Do you have an #investing class or offer lessons on investing in #stocks @rtrowe 
1689 2018-12-01 18:09:36 U do it as a hobby chasing fame and the bitches, I do it for residual the stocks and the bonds #ATG
1690 2018-12-01 18:08:52 Trump is literally violating his executive authority, under the Constitution, by singlehandedly banning bump stocks and his hardcore supporters don’t even care. If Obama did this, we would all be in an uproar. Don’t be a hypocrite on account of his party and promises.
1691 2018-12-01 18:08:45 elle va être remplacée (très) bientôt par une grenade "moins dangereuse" (flash, gaz, 160dB, pas d'éclats) donc faut vider les stocks :))

1694 2018-12-01 18:05:40 Thanks! Entries are def my biggest struggle, but won’t stop grinding
1695 2018-12-01 18:04:53 More specifically, are these stocks in order of best to worst? What implications are meant regarding $NVDA from statement "but not even close to neckline." Is that a negative or statement or a positive one? Thank you for your time.
1696 2018-12-01 18:04:42 Everyone outraged but nothing done and this will continue until we are much tougher on the perpetrators I think the stocks and the pillory may be a good deterrent and without one this will continue sadly jail is not the answer. Now everyone is afraid to act.
1697 2018-12-01 18:04:37 well, the major problem is that they generally one shot people. If they were toned down to the level of supers in other fighting games it would be more reasonable or you would need a shit tonne of stocks, would be sick tho.
1698 2018-12-01 18:03:40 The problem is when all u do is cry nobody takes u seriously. So talk all u want while everyone else is laughing at u. Maybe u could buy some stocks for Kleenex.
1699 2018-12-01 18:03:39 The USD doesn't have a super strong correlation with oil prices at the moment. The USD will fall/YEN rise on any deescalation of the trade war. Growth fears will subside and stocks/oil will start rising Monday. This is an important day.
1700 2018-12-01 18:00:34 Except no one really likes that. We've just come to accept it. Hell, that's why everyone stocks up on Repels. Wild Pokemon in the overworld gives the player the choice to intentionally avoid them so they can further continue at their own pace. It's a good change.

At end of Sept with $SPX +9% and most PMs dramatically underperforming, they had to decide to either add leverage and/or add to whats been working the best, high beta growth stocks to try & close gap

Right in front of nasty 10% drawdown
1703 2018-12-01 17:55:37 I’d like to put them all in the stocks!
1704 2018-12-01 17:55:27 A poem should be spherical and burial

1709 2018-12-01 17:49:48 It's one of those things that sounds like it worked on paper, but not so much in practice. Theoretically, we could use stocks as money, but the value of stocks fluctuates like the dickens, so... that's clearly not going to work.
1710 2018-12-01 17:46:56 I have always thought that investing in stocks and bonds was a good way to save for the future so you weren't counting on the Gov't to provide for you. And investment allows for development of goods and services and creates jobs. Guess I was wrong.

1713 2018-12-01 17:44:33 My goodness, what a tragic tool he was. For decades he was the proponent of more African, Asian, South-of-the-Rio, and Jewish immigration into the US, and he got his wish. 

He displays a rare ethnic ingroup preference for one of the US' founding stocks, and he faces backlash.

What, pray-tell, are you smoking?
1725 2018-12-01 17:36:32 Mark, When you are rightly talking about being selective about stocks I was also seeing an Interview of Mr. Buffett where he was saying "Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund."

1733 2018-12-01 17:30:11 If conservatives get to laugh at THOTs going to jail for supporting policies that require taxation, and then being caught for tax evasion...

1740 2018-12-01 17:24:26 I encourage you Styx to read the NFA law. It clearly stated that bump stocks are illegal. Although I do share the same believes as you. They are clearly violating the NFA.
1741 2018-12-01 17:23:35 Sugar stocks never outperform the market in the long run. No use tracking them so closely. Simple formula for sugar stocks is buy on bad news when sugar prices are low and sell on good news when sugar prices are high

1774 2018-12-01 16:57:20 $BG has a Dividend Analyzer Total Score of 32 (out of 100) and a Dividend Safety Score of 9 (out of 33). That would make it an outright sell in my book. My spreadsheet updates 420+ stocks every month.

1779 2018-12-01 16:53:01 Trump has proposed a bump stock ban. This is pointless and will solve nothing. It's also unconstitutional. Gun crime will not go down just because you ban bump stocks. 

I oppose this stupid fucking idea.

1797 2018-12-01 16:37:33 Because in crypto, tokens do not equate to stocks. Very different things. Sure they behave similarly, but crypto is an entirely new asset class, and it’s not intrinsically tied to the value of its parent organization. One organization can have many BCs..unless that changes then..

1803 2018-12-01 16:33:11 In 2017,cement companies reported gross margins of 42% & more. Today 24%.Market price per bag is almost same. Steep decline in gross margins eroded earnings & mkt price of stocks. DR up r down is secondary thing.

1810 2018-12-01 16:28:11 Healthcare should not be about profit.

1818 2018-12-01 16:18:21 I don’t even be tryna teach niggas about stocks. I just show them how much i made. That’s the only way people listen to me.

1820 2018-12-01 16:16:35 It's a TRAP!!!! These days after NBFC crises and liquidity crunch... banks & other corporate companies are offering attractive deposit rates.Urge you to apply sense, they will make atleast 2x from your money through lending loans(consumer,home). Invest in  those stocks instead.

All you want to go after is a few poor people trying to get food stamps.

Get f*cked
1823 2018-12-01 16:14:13 Eh. Trailing 1-2 returns are in this range a lot more often than the market has a major peak. My only point is that stocks don’t necessarily “owe” anyone much and this year’s action is not inconsistent with topping action.

1825 2018-12-01 16:06:18 I bought a bunch of bank stocks in 09-10 because they had all been destroyed in the recession and I swear to god they didn't move an inch while Obama was in office.  I know they kept them flat on purpose somehow.
1826 2018-12-01 16:05:13 Penny Stocks 2.0 Their only purpose is, to accumulate more Bitcoins.
1827 2018-12-01 16:03:15 Does any smart person just buy oil stocks only & put them in their RRSP?  No. Why? Diversification. It helps limit volatility & potential for big losses that’s why a basket of stocks in multiple industries is better.  Economically-this is no different.  But hey-the LEFT! #ableg
1828 2018-12-01 16:03:14 there all cowardly scum who prey on the elderly. when caught should be put in stocks in the town square and then jailed for life or preferably hung .

1830 2018-12-01 16:02:36 but surely it’s not a problem if they’re piling on debt to buy back their own stocks, right?!
1831 2018-12-01 16:01:46 Exactly. When, in fact, it's just the opposite. Poor people spend their money on food, clothing, etc. thereby stimulating the economy and creating jobs. The rich buy stocks and bonds, which adds nothing to the economy.
1832 2018-12-01 16:01:41 As a Finn, would not mind having a heavy brigade here with stocks for a division.

1846 2018-12-01 15:51:12 Completely agree. It has to be a judicious mix of large , mid and small caps . It takes time to build a portfolio but it’s worth investing time and research from time to time .. though of late it has become a challenge seeing so many stocks moving without logical presence

This policy saves zero lives.

1861 2018-12-01 15:41:00 Not only NO raise they should pass legislation that prevents these “Law makers” the ability to cash in on stocks. They obviously have insider information and buy/sell stocks which should be restricted. Their financial interest influence their voting unfairly.

1882 2018-12-01 15:28:34 This data actually supports my point that bubbles need not always happen in stocks with flaky business models.
1883 2018-12-01 15:27:45 Of course there is an element of greed involved., much like where you decide to put your extra savings in either GIC’s, stocks , bonds, real estate etc.

1890 2018-12-01 15:26:02 Right. People need to understand that corporations are NOT designed to care about the customer. By law, yes, by law, they are moneymaking machines for profit maximization only. In other words, they exist to buy stocks, raise money, and sell goods, and repeat. That's it.

If you are VERY confident of your stocks' performance, sooner or later u WILL be disappointed. 

Insecurity is constant in an investors life. 

You're merely the tick on a dog & the dog has a mind of its own 
1910 2018-12-01 15:11:24 Ok so your performance seems to be solely reliant on market appreciation, particularly market appreciation in ‘high growth’ high multiple tech stocks. Wouldn’t your clients be better off buying cheaper ETFs, take the proceeds and invest in cash?
1911 2018-12-01 15:08:40 We already were experiencing economic growth before tax cut. What tax cut did was allowed Corporations to buy back their stocks sold during recession. Now they are making a bigger profit at the executive level. Trickle down theory did not work as explained. Wages were not raised
1912 2018-12-01 15:07:33 I don't own it either. I HAVE started buying bank stocks where the product/tech employees I've interacted have been "surprisingly smart" and also good people. We'll see if that pays off in 10 years.
1913 2018-12-01 15:07:25 I built an algorithm detailing how much you’ll have if you have a 6% increase in value or your portfolio a week trading stocks. Switching to 10% when you get to 25k because that’s when Robinhood let’s you say trade daily.

1917 2018-12-01 15:04:52 Kinda? Pro stocks would be neat but I thought they ran full tube chassis like a current lm/slm back then.
1918 2018-12-01 15:03:54 I wonder how the right would have reacted and responded to President Obama pushing to ban bump stocks while imposing tariffs on China while cozying up to Putin?
1919 2018-12-01 15:03:48 So, like, a bunch of Olds Cutlass and Lumina Pro Stocks? Be still, my heart.
1920 2018-12-01 15:02:51 inoorder yon pag sa school be hahahaha aantay ka pa ng stocks
1921 2018-12-01 15:02:48 Oh, that will stop them. They'll shoot innocent people, but people telling them to throw out their bump stocks will definitely fix all that! </sarcasm>
1922 2018-12-01 15:02:24 Because there are no stocks, that is why the order was cancelled with the item required. We do apologise.
1923 2018-12-01 15:00:30 @AseefaBZ Miss Zardari is correct in one sense.. the “struggle” is unmatched.. no amount of investment, be it stocks, bonds, lotto, gives you 10% cash back so consistently...
1924 2018-12-01 14:58:42 Turd-muffin Mellon-clown-face .. such a pathetic overcompensating fool.. can’t wait for him paying for his treasonous antics.. 

Dya think they could put him in stocks so we can throw rotten stuff at him first 
1925 2018-12-01 14:58:14 If you go to a local short track, the street stocks usually put on the best show. They also have some of the most "spec" rule books. Why do they put on such great racing? The cars move around, you have to drive them hard and they have very low grip compared to their power level.
1926 2018-12-01 14:58:11 Yes, but I like the clean drinking water, and having my trash picked up.
1927 2018-12-01 14:57:10 meh. mental stops work too. thats what timothy sykes teaches for penny stocks. i hardly ever use stops in the markets in general. even steven dux too
1928 2018-12-01 14:56:50 I think that is an exact quote from Schindler's List.

Great good for you.
A little more money in your pocket is all it takes for you to give up American exceptionalism.

1930 2018-12-01 14:55:22 conservatives need to stop justifying bump stocks
1931 2018-12-01 14:54:55 Il paraît que c'est galère niveau des stocks. Bah, moi j'suis dans un placard à balais, mais avec des néons ça rend pas si mal finalement. Au moins j'aurais économisé de la thune 
1932 2018-12-01 14:54:00 Can you please buy YG stocks for Lisa 
1933 2018-12-01 14:50:47 But there are plenty of stocks that rise and then fall horrifically.  Or are undervalued and spike.  I did study finance.

1935 2018-12-01 14:48:29 Unfortunately that's not the SECs game and why I left stocks..they will prevent you from making money...but they for sure won't stop you from losing it...all in the name of "protection" you never asked for in the first place...reminds me of the mafia
1936 2018-12-01 14:48:05 di naman ako maga-accountant pero nababaliw ako sa stocks and bonds... help me juseyo!
1937 2018-12-01 14:48:02 De notre côté, on a dédicacé il y a 15 jours à la fête du livre du Var à Toulon et le libraire n'a pas eu de souci pour commander les bouquins déjà sortis de notre catalogue. Soit c'est comme le dit Aerinn sur son Twitter sur l'absence de stocks, soit ils s'y sont pris trop tard.

1940 2018-12-01 14:46:37 Correlations with US stocks by maturity since July 2016 when rates started to rise:

DFA 1-YR Fixed = -0.0
DFA 5-YR Global = -0.2
DFA Intermediate Gov’t = -0.1
Vanguard Total Bond = +0.1
Vanguard L-T Treasury = +0.1
Vanguard L-T Corporate = +0.3
1941 2018-12-01 14:46:19 Like, when I started investing I thought if you buy smart and are patient it’ll work out but nobody talked to me about the benefit of investing in bonds over stocks and my advisor should have. I was young and had NO CLUE you could invest in bonds, and that they were less volatile
1942 2018-12-01 14:45:36 I’ve tried to use internals to dictate what I’m doing to some extent, i.e. if internals point down, I find weak stocks and short.  If internals up, I find strong stocks and long.  I got smoked for a week because of the disconnect.  Brutal.

1945 2018-12-01 14:41:32 Well GM filed for bankruptcy previous to that so they only could go up, but it was after a lot of shareholders lost money. The bailout also allowed them to buyback stocks and raise their stock price. It's fucked up how that works.
1946 2018-12-01 14:40:59 Why always us...
1947 2018-12-01 14:40:45 Moreover, if the deal on the table doesn’t go through there are two possibilities. The default position is no deal, and anyone who says that is t going to cause huge financial damage is a f@@@@@@ scoundrel who should be placed in the stocks (3)

1962 2018-12-01 14:18:50 Yeah, all stocks are up (blue), especially health care stocks (red).
1963 2018-12-01 14:17:36 As a option seller you will realize late that its only good in nifty not in stocks...best of luck

1966 2018-12-01 14:12:38 Pull up I got some stocks to talk about with you 
1967 2018-12-01 14:11:14 This appears to be an inflated economy. Companies used their huge tax cuts to buy back stocks so it inflated our stock market making it appear to be doing extremely well. But in reality it’s a temporary swell which has to come down because it’s fake. Then...recession

I shall try grow stocks so I can show you it in the day.

1971 2018-12-01 14:08:40 Same here Atulji. Your tweets have so much weigtage and are based on research on fundamentals. So don't worry the action (price of stocks)  speak louder than words
1972 2018-12-01 14:08:14 Everyone in this game is 1 combo away from putting you in kill %. Stocks are going to flyyyyyy
1973 2018-12-01 14:08:05 Idhaana saar unga takku? Adhellaam mudinjiruchi. Also stocks will be very limited.
1974 2018-12-01 14:07:54 No, we are the best bcos we are volunteers, I wouldnt want a conscript on my 6 if his heart wasnt in it. In saying that, there are many roles in the forces that teach trades etc. Bad Lads Army was a good series, maybe something like that and public stocks/billboards.

1977 2018-12-01 14:04:12 I get it. "We" want the same tax evasion methods other countries offer. Also, paying in stocks costs the company no real money, correct? I wonder if "top talent" actually wants to get paid in stock options. I certainly wouldn't...
1978 2018-12-01 14:02:47 @niftywizard plz suggest some mentally interaction book names for trades!!! Will be helpful for trading stocks market !!

1980 2018-12-01 14:01:08 And the FED will be looking at these 2 numbers closely as part of the "data." They will stop ONLY if financial conditions are tightened, and that has ZERO to do with stocks.
1981 2018-12-01 13:55:02 Confirm. And unfortunately this is even limited to „Private Veräußerungsgeschäfte“ so cant even offset trading gains (e.g Stocks).
1982 2018-12-01 13:54:13 Yep, GM is sitting on $10.8b in stocks 
1983 2018-12-01 13:54:10 That's why you hold stock for the long term. Stocks are much higher now than they were in 2008, are they not? I'll bet if we ever get to see Bernie's taxes he'll be invested in a lot of stocks. Because it's a wise financial decision.
1984 2018-12-01 13:53:45 "Paubos na stocks" sabi ng nagbebenta sa R14 Printing. Eh yung totoo naman ayaw niya lang malaman mo na may mas mura pala sa Recto 
1985 2018-12-01 13:51:23 Sorry to mess up your false positive, but this doesn't reflect gun sales. It's trade numbers. Conservative gun owners will be reviewing their portfolios and pulling out of "Social" funds during the Spring of 2019 and reinvesting, causing firearms related stocks to increase!

1988 2018-12-01 13:48:42 My dad died at age 42. We received all of $255 from social security. There's no way my mom could have retired on a $35k/yr job (and part-time weekend jobs) without investing in stocks of American corporations.

1990 2018-12-01 13:46:18 Bullshit. Hold stock for more than 6 months, like everyone does, and it's a far, far better investment than anything else. Millions and millions of Americans, like my paralegal mother, have been able to retire because of owning stocks. Not because of government. 1/2
1991 2018-12-01 13:44:57 It’s only a matter of time. Many quality stocks from this space have come to reasonable valuations.

1997 2018-12-01 13:41:25 Holding company’s articles of incorporation’s standard primary purpose is buying, holding and selling of stocks, securities, etc. And this is consistent to RHC’s general info sheet filed in SEC—its industry classification stated “other monetary intermediation”.

2000 2018-12-01 13:35:51 I work for a corporation. My mom was able to retire because she owned stock in a corporation. 50% of Americans own stocks in corporations. I don't mind paying people in China for products no one in the US will ever make, or do jobs no one in the US will ever do.
2001 2018-12-01 13:33:50 Whilst stocks last. 
2002 2018-12-01 13:31:42 It is customary for a holding company to engage in the buying & selling of securities in its ordinary course of business. In the instant case, RHC apparently purchased most of the subscribed stocks of RI and used them as the underlying asset for the PDR.

2005 2018-12-01 13:30:48 Commissions to trade stocks have fallen to zero or nearly zero. I suspect that cheap commissions have counterintuitively harmed results of retail investors by removing the explicitly visible cost of trading while the bid/ask and tendency to buy high & sell low remains obscured.

2019 2018-12-01 13:21:02 That's a very hasty conclusion! The paper only makes claims about which meat sources are responsible for the least pollution. Overfishing or biodiversity loss are not taken into account. Some small pelagic fish stocks have also been collapsing. Let's not eat those!

Behaviour in 2 types of scenarios determine your long-term returns

1. When there was an absolute bloodbath, stocks were dropping like nine pins & people thought investing in stocks was crazy. 

2. In a seemingly moderate times a couple of your stocks fall 40-50%

Is Ht media is good for long term ?
2040 2018-12-01 13:01:32 Well Trump tax cut helped GM to buy back stocks worth about about $13 billion. This raised price of stocks. Allowed executives to dump stock and give themselves raises. Not only GM did this many corporations did this. Trump industries benefited too.

2043 2018-12-01 12:55:07 Overall view on nifty is correct, but when it comes to individual stocks, I think many are wrong!

2051 2018-12-01 12:43:08 Enhorabuena @adolfo_stocks !!!!! Mucha suerte!!!!
2052 2018-12-01 12:42:04 Many experienced traders would agree that Financial stocks historically perform better in a steepening treasury yield curve environment, 

Financial Sector relative performance did not for most of November see confirmation in the treasury yield curve.

2056 2018-12-01 12:37:07 That looks like its just for stocks and ETFs. Im after bonds. They trad <90c on the $ and have pretty high yields. Some convert to stock on maturation. Im interested in these bad boys!

2058 2018-12-01 12:34:08 My late mother attended many of these free lunches, at which her investment advisor featured her as a poster child of being a newly savvy investor. Shifted > $1.1M IRA funds out of ETFs, CDs and stocks into 100% annuities and add'l $100k  into NQ annuity.

2062 2018-12-01 12:30:12  I see the super bearish stocks can turn positive while super bullish on sideways. Any possibility?
2063 2018-12-01 12:29:37 #ppfasagm US economic expansion in late cycle n higher interest rate may leading to lower valuation purely on basis of higher discount rate. can it not lead to lower returns from your US stocks even if fundamental performance is as per expectation but coz of  valuation derating
2064 2018-12-01 12:28:42 Two years in a row my Hungarian friends gave me Hungarian cookbooks and now I have no free time. I am also good friends with the Kurdish guy in the interesting corner shop who stocks Hungarian groceries.

2068 2018-12-01 12:26:17 stocks going down.. time to sell homies

2070 2018-12-01 12:24:54 Doesn't the Stock Exchange carry Russian stocks like "gazprom"? So Americans are'nt allowed to buy those stocks?
2071 2018-12-01 12:24:07 which is why his stocks constantly keep going down
2072 2018-12-01 12:23:04 Follow me if you want the truth. I would never put Documents on twitter because jack Dorsey and this GOVT. can not afford to see the people with the Facts that bring about Trillon Dollar Budget Paul Ryan walking 
AFTER INSIDE INFO on STOCKS Hank Paulson prior to 2008 Recession
2073 2018-12-01 12:21:06 This is a shame and Lordstown has Trump to blame. When will people realize that a president can't make jobs -businesses do and when tariffs adds more tax on to purchasing a car, it prices the average person out and sales goes down. Their stocks go down as well-

2076 2018-12-01 12:16:07 @NicolaSturgeon - have you made any provision for chopped pork stocks should the no deal happen? With everything else, the Tories forcing us onto that luncheon meat guff would be a step too far.
2077 2018-12-01 12:09:45 Early .com stocks. Missed by institutions. Told the public they were stupid for buying them. Public sold to the institutions. Lead to greatest bull run.
2078 2018-12-01 12:08:58 @PPFAS What is the CAGR return on international investments?
Is it better to invest our international portfolio in S&P 500 or should we pick individual stocks.
#ppfasagm
2079 2018-12-01 12:08:39 Vivek but not many people know that this man's portfolio held an average of 1000 (yes one thousand number) stocks at any given point of time ... At a time he held 1700+ stocks 

I don't how one should read this fact :)
2080 2018-12-01 12:05:46 29th M Street should double their stocks for Wintermelon & Caramel Macchiato  They're always out of stock so I tried Blueberry Yakult Series & it's making me sleepy. 
2081 2018-12-01 12:05:39 It's to, not too. And you have answered your own concern! If there's a stockpile and a plan to keep stocks flowing (even at great cost) then there won't be any "apocalyptic" "crisis" supply problem will there!
2082 2018-12-01 12:04:57 Massive Aquatic Plants Re-Stock!!

Pop in whilst stocks last!

2084 2018-12-01 12:02:44 You can never underestimate these pharma stocks.

It was around this time last year #PYC went from 1p to 32p and #VAL went from 1p to 8p.

Earlier this year #HVO went from 18p to 105p, and now with the need of a universal flu vaccine greater than ever, the potential here is huge.
2085 2018-12-01 12:00:14 The 2018 Battleforces go up for pre-order at noon!!

Stop by the shop to place your orders while stocks last!
2086 2018-12-01 11:57:06 C'est du dropshipping, quand c'est le fournisseur qui envoie directement au client final. Donc la boutique en ligne n'a pas de stocks : elle ne peut faire ni contrôle qualité, ni SAV correct, ni maîtriser les délais.
2087 2018-12-01 11:56:51 There is no way he will though.  Stocks fell quite a bit because of her actions.  How much money do you think she cost them?
2088 2018-12-01 11:55:39 La TH est un impôt qui ne prend presque pas en compte les capacités des agents = injuste

Les stocks génèrent des rentes. Piketty encore une fois l'a démontré.
Laisser s'accroître les patrimoines par la succession est nuisible à l'égalité des chances et au dynamisme économique.
2089 2018-12-01 11:52:09 If you start doubting everything (in stocks), then I am sure, you will end up with 0 balance in your demat a/c
2090 2018-12-01 11:52:08 Now that I’m learning and experimenting with investment options one of my biggest regrets is not investing my money while I was a kid. I was always taught to save my money by my Dad, but he never taught me about investing in stocks.
2091 2018-12-01 11:50:36 "sauf exception". Pourquoi nous allons jusque là dans notre discours ? Parce qu'une société qui n'a pas de stocks elle-même ne peut pas contrôler la qualité, ni faire de SAV correctement, a des délais assez longs et rarement la surface financière pour faire face à un pépin.
2092 2018-12-01 11:50:23 It was @BorisJohnsonMP who started this damn mess and then walked away leaving it for someone else to try and figure out. Johnson should be put in stocks and then we can all let him know exactly what we do think about him.
2093 2018-12-01 11:49:46 Je ne vois pas en quoi "ne pas taxer les stocks" constituerait une "aberration économique" ? Merci d'expliquer ...
La "TH" est débile par son mode de calcul, mais ni plus ni moins "injuste" que tout autre impôt ...

2094 2018-12-01 11:49:03 Like your style sir, but your attack on Bump Stocks and the Second Amendment has made even me wary of your intentions.  You and the NRA folded on that like craft paper in a kindergarten classroom.

Shame.
2095 2018-12-01 11:48:39 Stocks plummeted as the enemy in the camp goes on a rampage nitpicking, after which problems after problems  began to surface.
2096 2018-12-01 11:48:38 Errr...could it be end of month marking of stocks ppl are heavily overweight? Happened last month, too.
2097 2018-12-01 11:48:37 At this time the market will reward the investors who will invest in the companies that will be here for the years to come. It's all about picking the right stocks.
2098 2018-12-01 11:47:28 looked at the stocks and cracked up
2099 2018-12-01 11:46:54 Ne pas taxer les stocks et une aberration économique.
La suppresion de la TH fait consensus car c'est évidemment un impôt injuste. Rien à voir avec vos considération idéologiques.

2104 2018-12-01 11:41:10 How these mosquito-brained people can become scary and laughing stocks at the same time never ceases to amaze me.
2105 2018-12-01 11:38:48 They could have done that with the $10B in cash they used to buy back stocks since 2015.  I see boosting stock prices is more important than taking care of your workers.  Maybe might have saved some jobs as well.  Merry Christmas in the worst way to those losing jobs.
2106 2018-12-01 11:38:35 Mais vous répartissez la suppression de l'IR entre la TVA et la CSG. C'est cela qui atténue la progression de la TVA dans votre schéma. L'effet de la progression de la CSG est très fort sur les salaires...

Et que faites vous des taxes foncières ? Impôt de stocks par excellence.
2107 2018-12-01 11:37:52 Mules - Wehrmacht relied on them for logistical support on the E. Front and Ardennes - solid and soft supplies, exhaust pre-positioned stocks - don’t envisage a long campaign.
2108 2018-12-01 11:37:26 What isn't in that reading, is that a lump sum cash award program replaced those stocks...and the monthly bonus (that was only for FT, non temp associates) was absorbed at max pay out of 8% into the new hourly wages, ensuring no one would be shorted under the new comp package.
2109 2018-12-01 11:36:43 Hiii, saw around 1-2 stocks ni Joshua in Robinsons Manila around afternoon earlier! :))
2110 2018-12-01 11:31:30 Any parameter or number to gauge I mean in terms of Number of stocks > 5% and Number of Stocks < 5%......... Or BB Ratio > 1 & ADR Ratio > 1 is fine....Inputs appreciated
2111 2018-12-01 11:29:40 Le volume des impôts de stocks (foncier et autres) sont d'environ 25 milliards et L'IR est de 75 milliards. 
Si je convertis en points de TVA ça donne 15 points supplémentaires.
2112 2018-12-01 11:29:31 Haha Ive got my stocks elsewhere

2115 2018-12-01 11:23:54 Je n'irais pas jusque-là, il y a probablement beaucoup de facteurs qui entrent en jeu (manque de communication, soucis de logistique par rapport au volume de stocks ou je ne sais quoi d'autre), mais c'est dommage pour les auteurs qui sont pénalisés ce week-end.

WRITE your OWN.
2136 2018-12-01 10:55:58 This chart clearly show
- Volat. has seasonality (1 year). Lows arround december
- Opposite of stocks, volatility rising coincides with price rising, not plunging. Suppose b/c HFT nature of the manipulation and volat. xplodes when fundamentals overhelm price supress (seasonality)
2137 2018-12-01 10:55:37 Taxer les stocks est effectivement sans intérêt, en termes techniques fiscaux : opération complexes, chères et contestables ...
Mais cela peut être un objectif idéologique (c'est très net dans votre cas ...)
2138 2018-12-01 10:54:15 My point is no country forces you to keep money in banks. I have money in banks, stocks and bonds as per my free will. I know the risk and bear it. However if Govt says you can't keep cash at home they should stand guarantee for whatever method they propose.
2139 2018-12-01 10:53:53 ETFS should be not as volatil as stocks or cryptos. But infect one of my ETFS crashed since October for -8%. And people say #cryptos are not save.

2166 2018-12-01 10:12:14 Alberta’s lawyers are arguing that Canada’s responsibility under International Law for the "protection and preservation of the marine environment” only applies to “fisheries (extraction), the preservation of fish stocks, and the exploitation of natural resources”

How worried are you that governments around the world are starting to take note of loot boxes as the glorified gambling they are?

2173 2018-12-01 10:01:18 Ah yes but they are too busy taking stock in their stocks, off-shore accounts, fraudulent, financial deals, corporate corruption, tax evading, ...
2174 2018-12-01 10:00:19 How to invest:

1. Stocks
2. Have kids and let them choose lucrative courses. If they fail or dislike it, blame them for their entire remaining lives.

2178 2018-12-01 09:55:42 Psychologically, it can be difficult to start buying stocks after weeks and even months of extreme market volatility. With that in mind, investors should always
try and buy something on the follow-through day.  eIBD,  Investors Corner 12/3/2018

2181 2018-12-01 09:49:11 stocks I think will do well over next few months:

2183 2018-12-01 09:48:15 There is no shortage of data globally & plenty of it within the US that shows either the data is lying or US stock mrkt is lying.

2186 2018-12-01 09:43:53 Few suggested the stock being shorted. Was 45p at the beginning of this month & between 65-75 for several months prior. Lots of stocks have fallen for no in the last few months. So either just shit markets or shorting. Interested to hear what u think might have caused the drop

2188 2018-12-01 09:43:21 No sane person would invest in stocks or mutual-funds right now as the interest rates have climbed up to as high as 10%.. With this interest rates, market have become highly overpriced.

Does the value of semen now outprice frozen eggs?  Are they only less/more valuable if the egg is fertilized?

Would it become a viable and profitable business of placing stocks into  Cum Futures?

2207 2018-12-01 09:15:29 FWIW from a timing/cycle perspective I believe BTC can hold up through Dec18 if equities do the same and so far equities are doing just as I expected. Things can change of course. I see a brutal Jan19 though for stocks which is when I expect BTC to retest recent bottom near 3K.

2222 2018-12-01 08:58:32 @JustinTrudeau Canadian banks are guilty.  The market makers of CIBC were pumping up the stocks and on the last 45 days have been dumping. Yet the companies have achieved greater sales
2223 2018-12-01 08:57:15 @JustinTrudeau offshore hedge funds do not care if Aurora cannabis stock trades at 1 dollar and loses its USA listing. They manipulate the direction of stocks with the help of brokers banks and market makers even in Canada

2239 2018-12-01 08:32:33 Of course. People will find a way to kill others. But this is the point of common sense gun advocates. If we limit the number of legal bump stocks and high capacity magazines, it limits the chances of these tools being used to massacre people. We can deal with criminals next.

2261 2018-12-01 08:06:50 Preferred securities are a good idea for income investors, especially retirees. They combine characteristics of both stocks & bonds, but pricing is interest rate sensitive. As interest rates rise, preferred securities prices usually fall, and vice versa

2287 2018-12-01 07:36:32 I use an app called stash for long term investing. It has groups of stocks for sale, so you aren't relying on a single stock to make money. I purchase low risk high dividend groups. It's slow to sell so it's not good for quick cash

2339 2018-12-01 06:26:16 I personally take it like this - keep the list of 15-20 high quality front line stocks ready. Buy when either of them becomes oversold n sell when overbought. Simple technical indicator like RSI can be used.

2416 2018-12-01 04:40:18 Look man, NRA’s position is my position. If the consensus is that bump stocks blur the line and could endanger our current right to own semiauto weaponry, then it’s not worth it to keep them. Pick your battles.
2417 2018-12-01 04:39:50 Nice gani unta ang Narnia na book kaso feel nako paspas ra kaayo maubos ilang stocks
2418 2018-12-01 04:39:31 They are the pure manipulation, whether it’s commodities or stocks or any other classic investment tools. Recently we saw a huge manipulation in natural gas, it took 17% in a day with normal weather forecast, how come??
2419 2018-12-01 04:39:09 I find scatter plots useless for analyzing stocks. They dont represent the information in a logically perceptible way
2420 2018-12-01 04:36:30 You still don't have any stock, bond or ETF holdings right? You still working 9 to 5 believing your salary will sustain your standard of living forever righy? You still think getting into stocks is hard right? You got jacked by a pyramid scheme didn't you? What's the end game?
2421 2018-12-01 04:35:20 Your definition of 'enough volume' comes from experience with stocks that have larger floats. This float is TINY and does not need much to move. Look at the volume from .03 - .05... hardly anything. $INKW just churning here before higher highs hit AGAIN..
2422 2018-12-01 04:32:55 Many charters school perform the same as the average public school. If he’s making millions, the teachers who work for him should have shares/stocks in the profits/company (school).

2425 2018-12-01 04:29:26 “When cvs stocks up on their extra small condoms”
2426 2018-12-01 04:28:06 So yes, youre still not answering my questions. I will change my mind when youre able to show me 1-5mn per month stocks buying like your simulation for 8 years using BBCA and UNVR and TLKM share and get me to 1.4M.
2427 2018-12-01 04:27:31 I do not disagree with this statement. When the NRA wants to get rid of bump stocks too, the debate about keeping them is pretty weak.
2428 2018-12-01 04:26:10 Deep corrections are an opportunity to cleanup and buy good stocks. Sometimes better stocks would be available at cheaper valuations..

2433 2018-12-01 04:21:22 It is obviously a foot in the door for a start of a major action. Bump stocks are no great technical achievement but merely a way to reset the semi-automatic trigger without releasing it. Subsequent fire rate is much less then full automatic versions of small arms.
2434 2018-12-01 04:19:39 Filter for criteria you want technically and fundamentally, then look for the best chart setups within those stocks. Trade with the market- same direction as S&P. If S&P is trending down, you’ll have less success long.
2435 2018-12-01 04:18:07 @realDonaldTrump why the fuck are you banning bump stocks
2436 2018-12-01 04:16:47 Future of NBFCs ? time to invest in these stocks or not after RBI recent interest? If invest  , stocks to buy?

2438 2018-12-01 04:16:32 I trade in only big cap high volume FnO stocks . If you think a tweet of mine can move Reliance or BankNifty , I am bigger than Adani . Get real dude 
2439 2018-12-01 04:14:09 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
2440 2018-12-01 04:14:04 Bump stocks are for disabled people now? Look, bump stocks blur the line b/w automatic and semiautomatic weapons. NRA says regulate them out. They do not increase com eff of a shoulder fired rifle. Duh
2441 2018-12-01 04:14:02 wesker is a fuckin bioterrorist but stocks have never been higher!!!!
2442 2018-12-01 04:12:14 Hi. Just curious to know if that is a layout you built yourself or a program that sets up format for you? Interesting to use when searching for these kinds of stocks. Nicely done .
2443 2018-12-01 04:11:54 I always thought of forwarding my money for stocks but I don't have the capability :(
2444 2018-12-01 04:09:32 Rage comics was the first one I bought stocks in. But it had to be advise animals or lolcats
2445 2018-12-01 04:09:06 Hope you’re loading up on aggregation theory prints while stocks last
2446 2018-12-01 04:04:26 Yeah like there is a reliable list of everyone who purchased the bump stocks. You really think owners will turn them in or just hide them?
2447 2018-12-01 04:04:18 How many legally without a background check? Probably a good deal more than you think. You're aware that bump stocks have been banned, right? I don't know when it goes into effect but it was in the news a couple of days ago.
2448 2018-12-01 04:04:03 Brilliant skin rejuvenating facial set

How are the Marijuana stocks doing?  I'm falling behind in that sector's developments  but they're going to buy me a beachhouse... 
2450 2018-12-01 04:02:55 Now value investors should focus towards quality Mid and Small cap stocks as they are trading at quite attractive value,
once market attention or euphoria turning towards to these stock, gain will be in multiple which are unlikely in large cap.

2454 2018-12-01 03:59:30 Nairobi Stock Exchange, how sound is this institution ? I understand they are still trading mumias sugar stocks.
2455 2018-12-01 03:57:53 Nah son, you need a healthy mix of growth and dividend stocks across a diverse range of industries.
2456 2018-12-01 03:57:04 Congratulations. Bump stocks have been used in One verified event that killed 58 people and scores more injured. Mean while criminals will still get guns knives and cars to kill innocent people. This is a meaningless rule that won’t save anyone.
2457 2018-12-01 03:56:58 People could have bought a gun equipped with a bump stock, but why does that matter? Guns with bump stocks will henceforth be banned, ergo this is a gun ban. If gas tubes were banned so that all AR's became essentially bolt action, would that not qualify as a gun ban?
2458 2018-12-01 03:56:18 I like how it starts with 'cannabis' sounding all official like, then goes right to 'pot stocks.'
2459 2018-12-01 03:55:41 I would be happy with an electronic parts kit, but can't find anybody locally that stocks them.
2460 2018-12-01 03:55:03 I have mortgaged all my stocks with a bank in order to lock them for 20-30 years. Hence, I can't sell them in any circumstance
2461 2018-12-01 03:53:54 Thanks for the suggestion, I did think about it already, this contest is only for fun and I don't really want to put too many restrictions/limitations and take the "fun" part out of it....having said that I decided to set the limit at $1, I.e. penny stocks under a $1 not accepted
2462 2018-12-01 03:53:41 I give up, I can’t converse with irrational people who ignore facts, same as I don’t trade irrational manipulated stocks. Good luck with car, don’t run out of kool-aid

2466 2018-12-01 03:46:44 How many people who legally  purchased guns without a background check went on to commit a crime? Almost none.  Bump stocks can be made at home. Limiting the capacity of mags has no effect, note last time tried. None of what you suggested will help.  Can we discuss root causes?
2467 2018-12-01 03:45:50 alright thank youu! ^^
2468 2018-12-01 03:44:48 It’s funny how professional money managers can lose money like that. I think 1987, should have served as an example on not selling puts either in stocks and or commodities! I do successfully sell puts in volatility which can only present any losses on a very severe melt up.
2469 2018-12-01 03:44:48 For what? Lowering my taxes? Removing regulations? Putting American workers 1st? Securing our borders? Renegotiating bad trade deals? Leaving Paris Accord? Record low unemployment? Expanding GDP growth? Record optimism? Greater wages and opportunity? Good judges? Record Stocks?..

2480 2018-12-01 03:38:53 Look back to 90’s when we had a three year run of similar stocks to use, I think we dropped below $6.
2481 2018-12-01 03:38:36 I totally agree but with all the shootings and all the protests, all that has happened so far is no more bump stocks, supposedly. So in the meantime, people have to practice harm reduction and teach kids what to do in these situations.
2482 2018-12-01 03:38:30 Great, all 3 people who own bump stocks are gonna be pissed
2483 2018-12-01 03:38:17 Good point.  Maybe FEYE up 100% in 20 months means cyber stocks are finally starting catch a bid or, maybe we’re nearing a major cyber attack from bitcoin miners that want to promote change in payments and security to renew life into blockchain 
2484 2018-12-01 03:37:17 Sir,

2) what was the criteria for selection of stocks?
2485 2018-12-01 03:36:14 This applies more when you buy quality stocks during broader market mayhem...
2486 2018-12-01 03:35:33 Hope your immigration laws are fair, many of us may be seeking asylum in your fine country, this megalomaniac we somehow allowed to be “elected” is making middle class life impossible, if you’re not rich, own stocks and have two 401k’s, you just don’t fit in rumps world........

2489 2018-12-01 03:34:46 We need to codify many of the traditions that previous presidents and candidates honored, that Trump wouldn't. Esp-they must publicly release their tax returns before the primaries, and if elected, a POTUS-elect must divest their businesses & stocks or put them in a blind trust.

2494 2018-12-01 03:29:39 Yeah guys. This statement has to have a lot of stuff before it. Like picking up quality stocks and buying an index etf. But patience is very critical to make monies in this market.
2495 2018-12-01 03:29:22 How many stocks will the competitive scene have?
2496 2018-12-01 03:29:09 Lee. You want BIG money. Do some DD on stock options. You won't believe the kind of money you can make with options. Buying stocks pales in comparison. Check it oiut.
2497 2018-12-01 03:27:36 But it is not a private company.. It is a puplicley traded company that sells stocks to it's investors.

2500 2018-12-01 03:25:52 @GlobalProTrader David, if you are adding a few more puts on stocks today, do you therefore think there will not be any good news this weekend on the US-China trade talks? Or are you thinking it will be a sell on the good news event?
2501 2018-12-01 03:25:06 I am now ready to take your questions regarding stocks, just tweet me the complete name of  the company.  No direct messages, please! #thinkervenu

2504 2018-12-01 03:18:17 I think FPGA's have a lane in the market but - i only care about making money on stocks - that argument has not been made on this particular stock with the pumping. I need more
2505 2018-12-01 03:18:15 It’s a good time to invest in “Neck Brace” stocks 
2506 2018-12-01 03:18:14 Sooo I started investing in stocks... pray that I be great at this. Please don’t knock me
2507 2018-12-01 03:18:07 Comprehensive background checks for ALL gun sales is the main thing. Limiting the capacity of clips and magazines. Banning things (such as bump stocks) that make semi-automatics function like automatics. The root causes you suggest should be better addressed also.
2508 2018-12-01 03:17:47 Oh this is getting good, what popcorn stocks look good??

2517 2018-12-01 03:13:14 I know it was funny - thats why I said it - but there is a hint of seriousness in it too. These suggestions really do refer to things our socities used to have (putting criminals in stocks and throwing shit at them) but then stopped and wanting those days back is not a good thing
2518 2018-12-01 03:12:26 Buy oil stocks
2519 2018-12-01 03:11:22 Damn google stocks are selling for $1,100 shit that’s higher than Apple. If you cant buy uber when they go public buy companies that own stakes in it.
2520 2018-12-01 03:11:12 Immediately affect only in #INDEX .. then all housing finance stocks as well as #NBFC.

2522 2018-12-01 03:10:02 You misunderstand my argument. Let me spell it out slowly. The 2nd amendment does NOT protect the right to bear only some arms. For example, excluding certain rifle attachments. Bills restricting ANY arms, guns, bump stocks, sawed off shotguns, or anything else, are infringements
2523 2018-12-01 03:09:49 Meme charts and random lines cant predict the future and that price action trading is the only thing worth investing time into learning. It's also the simplest. >if the price goes up here, it goes up. Also that stocks have similar volatility atm and real world value.
2524 2018-12-01 03:09:46 Hi Christy. Can platypus trading company use this lesson as a teachable tool for trading stocks?
2525 2018-12-01 03:09:19 My $TSLA position is probably less than 1% of my assets. My actual Tesla is worth more than my shares. I hold more other stocks than $TSLA. How much are you short right now? What % of your position?

2533 2018-12-01 02:56:24 Its not just about disarming criminals. 
Plenty of people who can legally own a firearm wake up and take someone's or a group of people's lives. There must be progress on all fronts. Do you agree 50 round magazines and bump stocks are unnecessary?
2534 2018-12-01 02:53:08 The market is desperate for a rally. The market wants to rally. Every mom and pop investor out there is salivating to buy stocks at these wonderfully insane PEs coz they’re all in correction territory.
2535 2018-12-01 02:52:55 Friday November 30 2018... mom and I decided to get drunk on red wine and talk about how we should invest in marijuana stocks
2536 2018-12-01 02:47:30 But like........... what stocks lol
2537 2018-12-01 02:43:16 it’s literally charity why did they have such limited stocks :/
2538 2018-12-01 02:42:21 Because he’s spoken against bump stocks since the Las Vegas shooting. This isn’t out of character for him. He’s been promising this ban since around October of 2017. Our founding fathers didn’t fight for the right to bear all arms but rifle certain attachments.

2548 2018-12-01 02:35:03 I honestly don't know if bump stocks would really be covered under the 2nd amendment. It's not a functional part of the gun itself. An extended magazine still functions the same, as well as a tactical stock, or a scope, or whatever. They also banned the auto glove years ago.

I think the viciousness from some of these "free thinkers" towards some conservatives who disagreed with Loomer's tactics seems a little bit SJW like

Let's be honest tho,if she was a lefty, they would be mocking her,don't lie guys

2554 2018-12-01 02:31:49 M. Bogle in his book said that if everyone were invested in index funds there would be only dividends. But that is really improbable because people are greedy and want to beat the market. There are still a lot of people in Mutual funds and in individual stocks.

2558 2018-12-01 02:28:09 Give it a bit. The stock market should crash within the next two years. Then you'll have nothing. No stupid president and no stocks worth a shit. But hey, I could be wrong. Get back to me in two years. We'll know then where all this landed.
2559 2018-12-01 02:25:56 I understand that CPP needs to get the best returns and the market has been sluggish. Still, US prison stocks? Why not Canadian cannabis? Better than good ROI, legal and no violation of any number of international laws, covenants and declarations.
2560 2018-12-01 02:25:41 #BT21Toronto wasnt that bad tho, im expecting a blood bath line since i know a loot of people are coming yet i was expecting that they have more stocks or other mds to provide since itll only lasts unitl the stocks are sold out
2561 2018-12-01 02:23:59 You’re wrong on stocks & real estate. Crypto is not an investment you should ever make
2562 2018-12-01 02:23:44 I'm a little more lenient on defamation because if you say something false and it costs someone money (Trump crashing people's stocks), that has monetary repercussions. 
I'm dont want regulation of words to protect people's emotions, because that is a vast range of possibilities.
2563 2018-12-01 02:23:36 Not into trading crypto(s).. been eyeing this for a while, bought bitcoin and sold  it off coz was trying blockchain facilities. Searching for ethereum miners, but couldnt support MY money R&R. So i ended up, watching for years .  I am looking forward for Aramco stocks!

2565 2018-12-01 02:23:15 I do not support removing guns from responsible hands. I do support removing violent criminals from society. Hands and feet kill more people than guns. So do doctors and cars. Bump stocks make semi autos fire at the rate of machine guns, so they should be regulated thusly.
2566 2018-12-01 02:20:08 I want to see Fairfax stores stocks of GTX 1080's to raise. NOT FREAKING KEYBOARDS

2568 2018-12-01 02:18:56 The only thing noticeably holding up our economy and making stocks continue to slowly rise are technology companies.
2569 2018-12-01 02:18:12 Most clients don't own just stocks. FIA's, the right ones, have blown the doors off of bonds.
2570 2018-12-01 02:17:06 There have also been reports that he’s getting ready to sign a ban on bump stocks. Allegiance to principles not people.

2572 2018-12-01 02:14:35 A pinch of salt will be less.. A glass of salt may be appropriate when it comes to investing in stocks bought by the geniuses.. They never tell what went wrong in their investment thesis.
2573 2018-12-01 02:14:24 traders in OTC stocks need to learn a lesson. ALL public companies, no matter OTC, NASDAQ or NYSE will always suffer dilution. Acquisitions, raising capital, stock incentives - always. It comes down to fundamentals. Not dilution.

2575 2018-12-01 02:13:08 not stocks, brushes, it's because they look clean
2576 2018-12-01 02:12:46 I would submit to you that folks looking for performance (in the traditional sense) shouldn’t be choosing FIAs. That’s what stocks are for.
2577 2018-12-01 02:12:21 Are those kids proposing gun regulations to ban bump stocks? Oh wait no, it’s your boy Trump doing that... 
2578 2018-12-01 02:11:25 looks nice but why the fifa stocks?
2579 2018-12-01 02:09:40 Did the same, even cashed out stocks for more #XRP. It would be terrible business practice  for  @RobinhoodApp @AskRobinhood to keep ignoring the number 2 crypto.

2582 2018-12-01 02:06:02 Have a nice weekend, .  Remember to rock out with your stocks out....as long as the outcome is income.  See you all Monday.
2583 2018-12-01 02:04:28 Bump stocks are incredibly stupid though. It would be better to just legalize fully automatic rifles. Bump stocks are sloppy and could result in friendly fire.
2584 2018-12-01 02:03:52 I’m pro gun, Personally I don’t care. bump stocks are not practical for real world situations and are just range toys
2585 2018-12-01 02:03:02 2)  I think if the differential narrows: WCS, Edmonton, condensate, etc, stocks would recover rapidly as fears of things like dividend cuts and bankruptcy risks seem to be banked into shareprices of many producers.  It also shows an action plan, finally action is being taken!
2586 2018-12-01 02:03:00 So how will oil, India Rupee and Indian stocks will perform with Rahu in Punarvasu, Saturn in Venus's star and Jup in Anuradha? Oh yes - Mercury too Retro!! #FinancialAstrology

2595 2018-12-01 01:54:38 Also like to add that I still don’t disagree w/ ban on bump stocks but that bill looks a lot like the gun manufacture lobbyists had a lot to say.
2596 2018-12-01 01:53:17 This is a total ban on firearms with bump stocks, period. The fact that you can just turn in the bump-stock instead of the entire firearm doesn't change that. At the end of the day, firearms with bump stocks have still been completely banned.

2601 2018-12-01 01:49:47 Trump approved? Or am I thinking of who approves of and is pushing for the banning of bump stocks, confiscation of private property, and the extremely flawed ERPO law? No matter, he’ll do wants. And clearly he doesn’t want the wall.

2605 2018-12-01 01:45:06 What gun is outlawed when banning bump stocks? Scalia clarified in Heller that the government does have the power to regulate guns, but not ban. Outlawing bump stocks is clearly regulating firearms.

2610 2018-12-01 01:42:58 The law Congress passed is the Firearms Control Act of 1934, OUTLAWING automatic weapons. Banning bump stocks is not banning a weapon.

2653 2018-12-01 01:04:47 My point from the beginning is that twitter rest of FANG stocks are failing to follow their own terms of service. They are interweaved into the fabric of the civilized world. Thus - begging for government regulations 
Starting with not effecting elections & banning conservatives

2657 2018-12-01 01:01:36 Hope they don't let this man conduct any stock trades on wall street while he is president. He is destroying stock prices. Lowering them to probably buy them. So when he is out of office in 2020. It will be fixed a stocks go back up he would profit. Leave Apple alone
2658 2018-12-01 01:01:08 If they can regulate/outlaw machine guns, hand grenades etc they can certainly regulate/ban accessories. Not sure what your argument is. Again, It does not say you have a right to bear ineffective bump stocks we wouldn’t even use in war.

2682 2018-12-01 00:38:56 Turns out, murder is already illegal. Many devices can be used to murder. A vast majority of those devices never do. For all guns, that benign majority is 99.9965%. For bump stocks, it’s magnitudes greater. The devices are not the problem.
2683 2018-12-01 00:38:30 wow this, EA and Sony Stocks are tanking too
2684 2018-12-01 00:37:43 It seems that most of the reactions are either non-existent, or very small. So the strategy seems to be getting sucked into investing in random stocks. I think putting (date & value) thresholds on the trades will clarify whether it beats the market.

Bump stocks obviously do interest mass killers and Paddock whether an anomaly or not is reason enough to ban them. Semi-auto weapons are already deadly, bump stocks add to that.

2764 2018-11-30 23:47:58 A smart lawyer will use this to overturn 922(o).

The premise is it creates an illegal machinegun.
BATFE, under Obama, allowed bump stocks.
If BATFE then reverses and declares bump stocks "constructive possession of a machinegun", bump stock owners sue - putting 922(o) on trial.
2765 2018-11-30 23:47:20 Trump blinks, tariffs will be put on hold. The announcement will be tomorrow, stocks go through the roof on Monday.  This bear market and recession are officially put on hold until after the election in 2020.

From what I could glean: buy stocks > start company > buy resources for company > produce products > fulfill contracts > make money for the company & shareholders. There was more going on but overall it looked good.
2801 2018-11-30 23:17:21 my day 1 diddy was messin up this good shulk player and ever since ive believed the mu was booty butt cheeks. My diddy at this point couldn't even spell optimal neutral and I would get occasional 2 stocks. I have good fundamentals but they're not THAT good
2802 2018-11-30 23:16:35  It’s that time of year again. Beautiful freshly cut Christmas trees are in stores NOW! To us, nothing says Christmas more than that smell of a fresh Christmas tree  Come down & grab yours today, while stocks last. Happy decorating! 
2803 2018-11-30 23:15:37 Elementary mistake, man. Can't compare stocks and flows like that
2804 2018-11-30 23:14:51 I do read news reports, and every time he golfs with a Senator it is included; it happens about 10% of the time or less. No one inherited what they have now, unless they inherited last week. Had he invested in  stocks what he inherited, his wealth would be the same or better.

2807 2018-11-30 23:12:25 OK. Let's talk next week playbook. G-20 will most likely be a non-event: "constructive" talks, "getting close to a deal", but nothing concrete. I think vol gets SMOKED on Monday and stocks rally. Near-dated vol is so pumped up that it's hard for vol NOT to be lower on Monday.
2808 2018-11-30 23:12:09 And this is just a feel good gesture. Bump stocks were possibly used in one shooting.
2809 2018-11-30 23:11:42 Puration
2810 2018-11-30 23:11:25 I may buy it.  Depends on volumes and if it gets heavily discounted against the placing price. 

I've started tracing volumes on stocks that have had placings over the last year.  The liquidity has been so poor that many sink and still have an overhang.

2818 2018-11-30 23:00:31 Awesome get rid of bump stocks and AR-15s
2819 2018-11-30 23:00:31 Lol that's not how 401ks work tho. If u felt like tht use a different investment like stocks

2821 2018-11-30 23:00:17 A year ago I decided to throw my Roth IRA for the year in ms instead of Apple. I was looking in tech stocks with large dividends. Today that looks like a smart move...I kind of want to swap them with Apple that far down though

2823 2018-11-30 23:00:00 What’s great about markets such as horse racing is what is “right” in the past is no longer “right” now.  Markets evolve.  Such as betting speed figures in horse racing, buying value stocks in finance, and stacking off with KK all-in preflop when deep in a poker game.
2824 2018-11-30 22:59:27 Lot of wasted energy.  Ban something that anyone can make and really is pretty silly.  I could care less about bump stocks but to see people basking in the glory of this is hilarious.
2825 2018-11-30 22:59:16 A wall isn’t going to keep us safe. People coming from Mexico aren’t the problem. White guys with ARs and bump stocks are a problem, Saudis using planes as missiles are a problem, @realDonaldTrump working for Russia...a problem. #RepubliKKKans #NoWall #MaGat

2831 2018-11-30 22:50:38 Yup, for free. I'm not a member, I just call BS when I see it. Personally I could care less about bump stocks since my trigger finger is wicked fast. Also, if you want to spell correctly, #arrestNRAmembers

2834 2018-11-30 22:49:34 Feel like you made pretty poor points and then segued into tech stocks which is irrelevant

Gaming revenue is driven by average revenue per user growth being massive as gamers age in and loot box like tactics ramp up and the growth has been massive.  You didn't address this
2835 2018-11-30 22:49:06 I definitely want to buy stocks 
2836 2018-11-30 22:48:48 there will be brand new people to the scene that may have had their first competitive experience via a "3 stocks, 7 minutes, Hazards Off" online ruleset. I'm talking about brand new people.
2837 2018-11-30 22:48:27 Better than investing in actual steels stocks. Oof.
2838 2018-11-30 22:44:00 time to brjng back another tradition.stocks and pillaries for our village idiot councillors.

2840 2018-11-30 22:43:34 I could be getting paid for this? Also, ATF has no ability to regulate bump stocks since Obama admin affirmed 3 times they aren't subject to auto weapons ban. Which means you need legislation to change, and of course you know that hasnt happened. Prove me wrong.
2841 2018-11-30 22:42:34 Stocks turn positive after Chinese official comments at G-20 meeting. More to follow.

2846 2018-11-30 22:39:36 And $FAANG stocks are billions of dollars in debt, with declining profits and a declining public image. I’d rather risk $4 a share on a new company with lots of growth in store and a solid brand, than a dubious one in billions of dollars of debt. Call me crazy

2848 2018-11-30 22:39:30 also that 10% stock ownership thing is nonsense

the study doesn't include public pensions, which means they exclude around 22 million people (public employees) who own stocks indirectly
2849 2018-11-30 22:39:12 Its like supporting a ban on bump stocks , give the left a inch and they will take a mile.
2850 2018-11-30 22:37:14 U.S. stocks higher at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.79%. Canada stocks lower at close of trade; S&P/TSX Composite down 0.04%

Crime prevention and law enforcement are based on PATTERNS. Bump stocks don’t interest mass killers. Paddock is an anomaly in the history of Rampage Shooters. 
No reason to punish gun owners except to appease hysteria.

2864 2018-11-30 22:26:57 Thales workers are angry because @Patrice_Caine CEO of @Thalesgroup received 303 212 € of #Thales #stocks last september. This is indecent ! A #strike could be planned to protest against wage restraint for employees. Annual negotiations are expected soon.
2865 2018-11-30 22:26:39 The popular one with the rising stocks
2866 2018-11-30 22:26:10 Damn I just lost all of my bump stocks in a boating accident
2867 2018-11-30 22:25:57 In the immediate sense, an agreement would likely be risk positive should any further signs of trade wars be put on hold/off. #USD could fall as a haven asset if stocks rally (#NZD up). But in the long-run, this could bode well for global growth = #USD higher down the road
2868 2018-11-30 22:25:54 the in to deep ndp's killed the small town, all the small farms. only way the ones who lost could capitalize was to buy computer stocks for their section of land. she's corporation market now and theyre getting billion dollar bailouts still collecting million $$$ bonuses
2869 2018-11-30 22:25:18 Agreed. Everytime a Republican gets in office:

2874 2018-11-30 22:20:38 I can’t get an answer from any contacts at NRA. It seems trump is supporting this bill and the nra is supporting and even helped draft it? Is this true? The actual bills language is FAR more than just “bump stocks”. It’s dangerous and extremely misleading.
2875 2018-11-30 22:18:21 This is bullish because at the end of the best week for stocks in many years, everything is #bullish
2876 2018-11-30 22:18:20 @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks is not only not going to solve anything... but it will be the sole reason why you don’t get re-elected. If this ban passes you’ve lost, and if you loose America looses. I thought you were going to Make America Great Again.

2878 2018-11-30 22:17:31 not quite. traditional stocks are about trading short-term gains for long-term. for instance, I can hold amazon stock and sip those dividends or find someone to cash in an immediate short term burst. we both profit, it's just a matter of how long.

2885 2018-11-30 22:11:32 @canuck2usa  it appears allot of stocks breaking 1 hr resistant lines to the upside.
2886 2018-11-30 22:11:04 Market Close: MBS +19bps; DOW +199.62; NASDAQ +57.45; S&P 500 +22.41; 10yr Treasury 2.99%;  Stocks & MBS shared a late rally to finish November on a strong note.  Yields drop below an important floor (100 DMA) in the process!
2887 2018-11-30 22:10:20 fair tariffs are to be had in the deal. Canada had high tariffs on steel and aluminum now there gone. Obama gave GM a large bail out it did not good. The CEO is good friends of Hillary. She blew it stocks took a nose dive.

2894 2018-11-30 22:08:15 Since defined benefit retirement plans have been superseded by 401K's, the positions of tech stocks in index funds affects their retirement, if any.
Median balance of 401K's is $26K.  If the working class is 25%-55% of society, they are probably somewhat lower than that.
2895 2018-11-30 22:07:26 I'm sick of my stocks dropping like crypto
2896 2018-11-30 22:05:51 The "FTD Four" stocks I've discussed in recent reports are quite uncanny in the way they've all acted in the exact same way, mimicking one another all the way off last week's lows. Where do they go from here? A topic for this weekend's Gilmo Report. Got Gilmo???

2899 2018-11-30 22:03:22 Clearly is a possibility, but a break to sub-3.00% yields ahead can only occur if/when the bear market in US stocks returns... Methinks it is a real possibility, but likely after Trump spins this China trade weekend as a huge win for America (it won't be upon further analysis)
2900 2018-11-30 22:03:19 Oh I agree he broke in less than 2 yrs on bump stocks when he said he never would. He isn’t principled at all

2908 2018-11-30 21:58:32 Lol I just remembered a tournament sometime ago where someone was sding my bayo combos hard to the point where he pressed the pause button twice and had to SD both of his stocks. It was upsetting to say the least.
2909 2018-11-30 21:58:18 #FridayFeelings In a deflationary economy brought on by Trump and Powell there will be a jittery and much weaker stock market. Pay attention to stocks that pay dividends. as they can be a hedge against potential losses elsewhere, especially in real estate.

2911 2018-11-30 21:57:31 This is one of the weirder moves I've seen in some time, more on the treasuries side. This recent leg up in stocks is still mostly a result of Powells comments (right?), so I wouldn't think stocks get slammed that bad if there's bad news about China this wknd.
2912 2018-11-30 21:57:15 Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Friday:

2920 2018-11-30 21:51:44 The law says more than one shot with single pull of the trigger is machine gun.  ATF already said bump stocks don't cross that line.  Any arbitrary ban only sets us up for the next arbitrary ban.
2921 2018-11-30 21:51:43 Since Trump took office, the stock market overall is way up. Last year was a historically good year. This year the market took a little breather, but has bounced back from  the recent slide. Stocks do not go up in a straight line. Trump’s economic record is very positive so far.
2922 2018-11-30 21:50:16 bullish signal if you are long bonds, and maybe for stocks if you subscribe to the theory that rising yields was a major factor in the recent selloff in stocks
2923 2018-11-30 21:50:04 Investors are piling into boring defensive stocks like P&G as 2018 comes to an end

2925 2018-11-30 21:48:13 World stocks ex Europe edge higher: US +.8%; Europe -.2%. US economy still humming along while much of world growth is still solid but slowing. Real question: What will US investors do in 2019 when US eps-growth slows to high single-digits (still good) and GDP falls below 3%?
2926 2018-11-30 21:48:10 So US bonds (specifically long end), US stocks, and USD were all bid to highs of the week into G20, but Trump's losing against Xi, Putin, and MBS? #solidlogic #watchthemoney #actionsnotwords #capitalflight
2927 2018-11-30 21:47:35 donnie donnie donnie... again...you signed your U-SCAM deal...well there goes   more companies moving production out of the US (like all of yours and   wifes products) and stocks are gonna crap once again...a disgrace...resign!
2928 2018-11-30 21:46:36 Coast is clear guys. Keep piling into those popular stocks with the 50-100x P/E ratios 
2929 2018-11-30 21:46:35 “in a rather masterful fashion he has already set up stocks for a great rally during his tenure”
hahahahahahahahahahaha
I have friends like that. True beleivers
2930 2018-11-30 21:44:19 So you’re saying that in a bull market stocks go up in a variety of circumstances
2931 2018-11-30 21:43:59 Crazy gap ups on close (and some run-ups) in a lot of stocks.
$ABBV, $PEP, $XLV, $BABA, $BR, $BMY, $JNJ.  Felt like a melt-up on close (exact opposite of morning of Nov 20th - which was the washout).
2932 2018-11-30 21:42:33 No they aren’t. As a businesswomen, they did it to adjust to America’s changing taste in vehicles. I drive a Ford F-150. That being said, GM is a POS. Especially doing it before the Holidays. Glad their stocks fell!
2933 2018-11-30 21:41:26 Fish stocks to roast coming February 2019......  1 million of you cannot defeat my one & only incorruptible President Muhamodu Buhari. Time will tell, 77 days to go.

2937 2018-11-30 21:38:40 Overall, my stocks are doing just fine. I sold my NFLX at 325 then repurchased it at 258. Sweet! I'm still hoping it'll swing right back up. That's why it's called "Playing the Stock Market". You've got to know when to hold them and know when to fold them.
2938 2018-11-30 21:38:27 the NRA did aell-out on bump stock bans. Personally, I think bump stocks are crap. I'd rather apply for a class 3 license.
2939 2018-11-30 21:35:59 Why did this relationship break down with QE? Fed increased money supply by trillions but CPI didn't really budge. I guess, one could argue we had asset inflation given where bonds and stocks are trading
2940 2018-11-30 21:35:08 Wouldn't it be fun to put all of them in pillory stocks on a flat bed truck, drive it around the country? Let The People chuck rocks, rotten food, and other projectiles at them! Then hang them for Treason on the rotunda front of WH, let the crows have the rest. 
2941 2018-11-30 21:34:57 There is a good chance Apple will "port" the Music app (and others) from iOS to macOS, like they did for Stocks, Voice Memo and News on Mojave. iTunes will slowly disappear.
2942 2018-11-30 21:34:19 Okay. It looks like George Soros talked badly about FB, and then FB hired the republican group to say he was part of an anti Facebook conspiracy, and I guess the output of the effor veered into anti-semitism.  But she had wondered if he had sold his stocks, and then shorted FB.
2943 2018-11-30 21:34:01 #stocks finish the week strong as $SPX $DJI $NDX and $RUT all close in the green. Join Coach Frank over on YouTube to discuss today's price action in the Market Recap #trading
2944 2018-11-30 21:33:48 I agree very poor! Its all the same ppl in first before tweeting and then dump into a rise! Leaving the average joe shafted!   Prime examples recently mos,aeg,imtk,yu,web,etc only invest and hold. Focusing more on crypto! Aim is dead! Notice the same stocks pumped yearly by same
2945 2018-11-30 21:33:43 Can somebody teach me about stocks and bonds? I want to invest.
2946 2018-11-30 21:32:29 many call it celery root. not you. the other day I heard u ask someone to pass the turnip-rooted celery. me, I tend to stick to the scientific name. gee whiz.

no matter which way you slice it (the celery root) you’re in for a subtle celeriac flavor, perfect for soups & stocks.
2947 2018-11-30 21:32:25 لو بتسأل على معادلة بيرنولي جت منين فلازم الأول تفهم حاجة اسمها Navier stocks equation  وتعرف بنجيبها إزاي "إثباتها" ، وبعدها بتحط شوية فروض فيها بتطلعلك Bernoulli's Equation .
2948 2018-11-30 21:30:33 Stocks went up slightly near the end of the day, just because Trump did not do anything destructive today.
2949 2018-11-30 21:29:36 What were they fishing for? I cant see any other species. This is a publicly stunt before the eu commission meetings to allow fishermen to fish for an already overfished species. It is greed with no care for the future fish stocks. Why cant you see that?

2959 2018-11-30 21:22:18 Another reason to get very familiar with only a few tickers, is that they will consistently respect indicators. Some stocks will consistently respect the 50day moving average, others don't care about it at all. Knowing which indicators your tickers respect can really help a trade
2960 2018-11-30 21:21:50 End of a month when stocks got whacked early. We often close on a high note. Next couple of weeks are probably more important “signals”.
2961 2018-11-30 21:21:16 Well the government does buy bonds in the open market so why not stocks. I think a better idea would be for it to buy crude futures at certain times.
2962 2018-11-30 21:20:19 OMG, that was so vicious. I hope the poor girl is Ok.  Bring back the stocks for behaviour like that.
2963 2018-11-30 21:19:25 Stop taking a knee for trump on bump stocks. NRA is anti right to individual defense.
2964 2018-11-30 21:19:17 Interesting. what stocks should we own during an expected upcoming Rapture event?
2965 2018-11-30 21:19:13 The USDOJ has reserved 17million dollars in compensatory damages for the victims of the 2017 Mandalay Bay Hotel massacre. If the dummies were smart they'd get those funds and much more from the fucking NRA since they don't have a problem with bump stocks and not the tax payers.
2966 2018-11-30 21:18:51 Stocks are on the rise as the highly anticipated meeting between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China to discuss trade approaches. #SUACCF18
2967 2018-11-30 21:18:29 U.S. stocks surge on Friday to cement best week for S&P 500 and Nasdaq in about 7 years.
2968 2018-11-30 21:17:31 It’s kinda good so I can get stocks but idk lol
2969 2018-11-30 21:16:50 I actually feel sorry for him. He inherited Yellen's optimal control which was designed to restore nominal GDP to trend. That bit worked  but by in the process it also reflated a bubble in growth stocks and housing. Hence any attempt to normalise policy was going to be tough.

2975 2018-11-30 21:15:16 Im not a man.. but the 'givenchy play' is sooooo nice! But not sure where stocks it anymore. Amazon stock it, think thats where i bought it from last yr x
2976 2018-11-30 21:14:19 These people will never understand. China is our Padosi! Check what they did to make the poor people's life better. It worked in China as, poor farmers can easily maintain live stocks of few animals, not every one is a Born Shareef to own a poultry farm!!
2977 2018-11-30 21:14:09 "Technical Forecast for Dow, S&P 500, FTSE 100, DAX and Nikkei"US stocks put in recovery moves this week as the book was closed on November trade. But can that enthusiasm remain into the final month of a volatile 2018?
2978 2018-11-30 21:13:53 Wall St again sees glass as half full: Stocks close out strong week with more gains.

Dow ends +199, +0.8% to 25,538. S&P and Nasdaq also +0.8%. For week, Dow +5.2%, S&P +4.8%, Nasdaq +5.6%

Falling bond yields help stocks: 10-year T-note yield at 3.0%, lowest since mid-Sept
2979 2018-11-30 21:13:05 a lot of branding but forget all that who trying to send me money for stocks
2980 2018-11-30 21:11:59 Stocks on watch, mainly due to current levels; do not own, but tracking price. $AAPL $GS $WYNN $RL $KORS
2981 2018-11-30 21:11:58 Signing last years spending bill, asking for 1/5th wall funding in exchange for giving the open borders crowd exactly what they want, giving Obama a better record on the 2A by banning bump stocks, no FISA release, & tons of criminals not in jail doesn't look like proof to me.
2982 2018-11-30 21:11:17 Disagree. Pointing out twitter bias is never wrong. Raised awareness. Nobody got hurt. No property was damaged. Twitter stocks have taken a hit recently due to concern that conservatives will leave the platform altogether.
2983 2018-11-30 21:11:00 @ImranKhanPTI has got a point. This was the very first step taken by china to increase income for the poor villagers. The Govt helped by providing few live stocks and within 2-3 years it worked wonders.
2984 2018-11-30 21:10:19 Someone willing to teach me how to invest in stocks?
2985 2018-11-30 21:10:08 GL anybody holding ash stocks!! I’m rooting for you all!
2986 2018-11-30 21:10:03 Stocks up: Dow 25,538.46 +199.62/0.79%; Nasdaq +0.79%; S&P +0.81%. Dow 5day +5.16%, 1mo +1.06%, 3mo -1.64%, YTD +3.31%, 1yr +5.39%.
2987 2018-11-30 21:09:17 If something bad happens with China, where do eurodollars even go?  We’re making new highs while stocks are making new highs?  What am I missing?
2988 2018-11-30 21:08:12 What we have seen over the last 6 weeks is proof that we are in a bubble for more than half of the listed names in the US.  The "blue chip tech" stocks were taken down 30-50% without a recession.  I suggest you wait for the FOMO + seasonality to fade and look to get short 2019.
2989 2018-11-30 21:08:11 Markets mounted a serious rebound this week. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq just notched their best week since December 2011. #stocks
2990 2018-11-30 21:08:03 #stocks higher for the month! Check back here later tonight when we announce the posting of our new @tsp4gov allocations for #December
2991 2018-11-30 21:08:02 then we are thinking alike!  what other stocks are you long on (or short) and I will plug them into the script.
2992 2018-11-30 21:07:44 How will bank stocks do when 29 year old bartenders turned communist wannabe @Ocasio2018 takes office?

Ocasio Cortez: "Um, banks have like, ALL the money, totally, and um, like, that's not fair."
2993 2018-11-30 21:07:34 Lol it's okay can't talk to my Mother in law either. She thinks her stocks are flying high bc of Trump ????
2994 2018-11-30 21:06:34 Chicks and football. Maybe stocks.
2995 2018-11-30 21:06:30 U.S. stocks surge on Friday amid G-20 talks and cement best week for S&P 500, Nasdaq in 8 years
2996 2018-11-30 21:06:25 I wonder how many funds that were puking stocks on both of those scary dips around SPX 2600 were loading up right into the G-20 because you know, that's how you do it- maybe it will work out ok- should be a fun weekend to observe...
2997 2018-11-30 21:06:11 I noticed... Not a lot of money pouring into stocks with all this good outlook. lol
2998 2018-11-30 21:06:08 in some Nintendo Stocks. Besides all that i found an actual Good reality show Forged in Fire to watch on History Channel, besides watching old shows and movies. Finally we are all one Human Family made in the image of a loving God, our Lord Jesus Christ, May God bless all!!
2999 2018-11-30 21:05:38 we made it! finally done with most of the end of year selling!!! yeah :)
 sure there will be some more in dec,, mostly small firms re-positioning creating a capitulation  event for stocks not likely to make more money next year.
 
anyway,, have a great weekend.

3035 2018-11-30 20:41:13 They’re FINALLY banning bump stocks. I can’t believe it took this much time and this many lives lost, but we did it.

3041 2018-11-30 20:37:57 My own personal opinion, news of Fed decisions definitely affects S&P, other news, much less so, because unlike individual companies who can rise or fall on one specific news item, in 500 stocks, that news may hurt some and help others.  Often nets out to zero.
3042 2018-11-30 20:37:52 In store tomorrow from 10am you can pre-order the new Christmas Battleforce boxed sets.

3043 2018-11-30 20:37:26 So ABH Subculture palette will be discontinued and this is why they are trying to finish all the stocks. 

This “discontinue” rumour also happened on ABH Modern R. The palette did disappear for a while and later it comes back permanently. Soooo...

3047 2018-11-30 20:35:04 I follow a thousand people in Twitter, and I can note that there are posts of insomniacs in the late evening. Facebook basically stocks posts from your friends to show you if you are accessing Facebook 3 pm.
3048 2018-11-30 20:34:30 Effective January 2019, the L Funds will increase exposure to international stocks (the I Fund) from 30% to 35%  of the overall stock allocation in all L Funds.
3049 2018-11-30 20:33:33 Your analogy makes no sense. We are talking about 2 great quarterbacks and the competition THEY have to face regularly.  The Jets, Bills are laughing stocks of the entire league.  The Phins are close as well.  The div teams Brees plays.....all have been to SBs or title games.
3050 2018-11-30 20:33:09 Probably worst thing for risk is stocks rise on an oversold RSI and skew rally - steepening Fed’s Dot Plot or whatever that thing is.. #2s10s

3053 2018-11-30 20:32:21 He weighs more heavily into the stocks he believes are more undervalued. These are his top positions, ergo he believes these are more undervalued than other stocks in his index.
3054 2018-11-30 20:32:19 Ha! The cawston press stuff, our corner shop stocks it
3055 2018-11-30 20:31:58 The only thing a bump stock does is help you increase the rate of fire.  I can do that with my finger.  I can bump fire without a bump stock.  If .gov can arbitrarily ban bump stocks, I see nothing keeping them from banning all semi auto firearms.
3056 2018-11-30 20:31:57 Surely... it's an issue but should we be looking at mkt cap when the stocks are getting hammered? Nobody cares abt the 'intrinsic value'. Suddenly, the most insignificant letter of RoI means 'of' and not 'on'.
3057 2018-11-30 20:31:42 Those buying U.S. stocks tonight are either long term investors who have not got a clue or short term traders who behave like gamblers. There is no reason to buy this rally, unless you are very clever and you will take profits early next week $SPX
3058 2018-11-30 20:30:51 Or always (and only) feature stocks up 80%+ YTD, their favorite metric.  I mean if I produced CNBC I'd add some variety.
3059 2018-11-30 20:30:48 Trump is banning bump stocks.. I’m very surprised, but I don’t see him doing this for no reason, maybe it’s in exchange for something he would want done.
3060 2018-11-30 20:30:09 The only way to get good is to play pros and get bodied because eventually you’ll start taking stocks and then slowly digest their movements, combos, and techs to implement them into your own arsenal
3061 2018-11-30 20:29:08 New Gun Owners Today: omg trump is banning bump stocks it's an infringement of our right (bump stocks already illegal in NJ)

New Jersey Gun Owners on December 10th: here you go governor Murphy you can my 15 round magazines no problem.
3062 2018-11-30 20:27:53 Yeah 3 stocks seems the way to go, especially considering you'll be dying in 1-2 interactions instead of 4-5.
3063 2018-11-30 20:27:19 Stocks up
3064 2018-11-30 20:25:46 just like stocks when the prices drop, people who say they will top up, won't.
All these plebs who were whinging that house prices were too high won't have any more excuses, but they probably still won't buy due to fear or lack of funds.
3065 2018-11-30 20:25:32 Stocks near highs of the day. Hopes that Trump and Xi will make a trade deal?

3090 2018-11-30 20:13:18 I’ve seen more people accepting them or saying “we may definitely need 3 stocks cuz they may be fast pace,” than people complaining. I think they’re just a loud minority
3091 2018-11-30 20:12:28 My mentor Jeff closed the month of November with an astonishing 91 winning percent trading stocks, I am so glad to be part of his program, if you want to learn how to trade stocks with a system that works, don’t look anywhere else,  join the winning team @TSXtrad3r
3092 2018-11-30 20:10:44 That is what i mean. Scopes, grips, stocks etc. We should be able to customize them and they should effect weapon performance too. Why would i bother unlocking cosmetic stuff? I prefer different play styles on same weapon. Specifications aren't deep actually.
3093 2018-11-30 20:09:58 $wday stocks rarely had this kind of pattern with zero pulbacks/buying opps until computers took over....you have to adapt to the machines to make money in this day and age.....(buy at highs) (sell at highers) lol

3096 2018-11-30 20:08:02 Sounds like what happened except its 150 billion for Boeing and other purchases dems gain nothing from? Start digging sir. Who owns stocks and what not.
3097 2018-11-30 20:07:34 @SleazyEarlll @whizmann I don't short stocks... don't even have ge stock that's just my opinion
3098 2018-11-30 20:05:46 Sometimes the penny stocks pay off with the highest dividends
3099 2018-11-30 20:05:37 I don't care about bump stocks and I get the disposable sacrificial lamb concept of giving them up. My concern is the antis thinking they smell blood, real or imagined. Maybe we should've asked for something in return.
3100 2018-11-30 20:04:47 while many go-to names have exploded the $SPX remains below its 50 and 200 day m.a.'s 
it's a market of stocks, not a stock market.
trade stocks on their own line of least resistance.
3101 2018-11-30 20:04:39 Y’all jump on those @AmericanAir stocks. Thank me later. 
3102 2018-11-30 20:03:11 Pretty obvious the Dems have been trying every which way to cool our Economy in appearances. They wanted huge drops in Stocks to reflect the Mayhem They're creating. "Stupid Americans" won't be 'Grubered.' Hey @GMC cold day in your house, when I buy your Products.
3103 2018-11-30 20:01:28 So bump stocks are ONLY useful when shooting at crowds before they disperse. As they are useless for accuracy
3104 2018-11-30 20:01:19 Recently learned that the S&P 500 actually consists of 505 stocks.
3105 2018-11-30 20:00:32 I'm trying to trade it... But if the economy was strong enough to justify a Santa Claus rally, would it still be driven by the same 100 stocks whispering among the walkers?
3106 2018-11-30 20:00:20 It's been quite a ride this year, that's for sure, such a huge contrast to last.  We're having to work for it.  Good job with the pot stocks.  You've got some good names there.  I'm a big fan of MSFT, AMZN, CRM, but of course, have a lot of company in that.
3107 2018-11-30 20:00:06 Good news on how to make a donation!

The best way to make donations is through gifts of appreciated securities, such as stocks, mutual funds and segregated funds,If you donate them to charity, you get a receipt for fair market value and  pay no tax on the accrued gain.
3108 2018-11-30 19:59:09 Another @MarketWatch article states that now is a great time to buy tech stocks, such as Microsoft and Apple. We are happy to say we have already invested in both. #SUACCF18

3115 2018-11-30 19:51:33 Auto industry took the big tax break but they didn’t give the workers raises or put any money into the plants... they bought back stocks and are now closing plants only enriching themselves, farmers have to depend on welfare and food stamps now because they can’t sell crops...
3116 2018-11-30 19:51:15 Risk parity and mean reversion: I find no improvements.
It might be helpful when trading more stocks, so I will keep it in de toolbox.
Conclusion for me: I keep it simple with equal weighted positions.
3117 2018-11-30 19:51:01 I was all in tech stocks before I started investing in pot stocks. Made most of my money with $NVDA $AMZN $GOOGL. I still love these companies and will definitely reinvest in the future but I'm still all in pot stocks now.
3118 2018-11-30 19:50:43 Doug, Re your post on RMP buybacks vs capital spending, looks to me like the buybacks is a good contrarian indicator for stocks, they seem to buy the most when prices are high.
3119 2018-11-30 19:50:38 Why do you say that? I’m confused how bad players will be punished besides it being 3 stocks

3122 2018-11-30 19:50:10 This recent OSC report on frothy pot stocks is interesting.  Most investors have bought them recently (after they have already gone up) with 32% relying on advice from friends and family members.  I wonder how well this is going to work out?
3123 2018-11-30 19:50:03 Your tax cut bill for the extremely wealthy only. So you or your businesses don't pay taxes, making billions from cons.

3129 2018-11-30 19:47:20 The results are in. Risk parity:
- Nasdaq 100 momentum: annual returns worse, risk adjusted better.

Positions in low vol stocks sometimes pretty big, makes me nervous despite low vol.
3130 2018-11-30 19:46:13 Amplification or exacerbation of externalities matters.

When QE devalues USD and buybacks inflate stocks, the externality is raised prices; but w/o raising wages and w/ wealth held inflated assets, the real externality of this is global market collapse from debt/low consumption.
3131 2018-11-30 19:46:08 What will happen when merch stocks finish?
3132 2018-11-30 19:46:06 As he should. No civilian should be owning bump stocks. Practically makes your firearm fully auto.
3133 2018-11-30 19:46:00 Semi conducters, tech is also interesting and I was invested in these kind of companies prior to cannabis but folded into Cannabis 100% for Canada legalization.

3151 2018-11-30 19:33:23 Growth is surely slowing, which can be a leading indicator of a recession. The market puked a lot of high beta growth stocks since early october.
3152 2018-11-30 19:33:22 Didn't most retail investors hold individual bluechips prior to this period?  If you held stocks in certificate form think about how long it would take to deal with selling them.  Then investors started using active mutual funds with high turnover. Does that narrative make sense?
3153 2018-11-30 19:32:47 @realDonaldTrump Dear President Trump, please do not allow the ATF rule change for bump stocks and other items in the rule change this will make law abiding gun owners criminals. It will also cause us to lose millions of dollars and put a financial burden on us and our families.
3154 2018-11-30 19:32:42 Stocks seem to be in a "holding pattern" waiting for U.S. China talks. Dow now up by 72 points.

3164 2018-11-30 19:28:37 The stocks! (I'm a fan of public shaming for social crimes.)
3165 2018-11-30 19:28:14 SOMEONE PLEASE UPDATE THE STOCKS #BT21Toronto
3166 2018-11-30 19:27:30 "my good sir, I am interested in your fine mousey-stocks, how much for a bushel"
3167 2018-11-30 19:27:26 Bump stocks are in the process of being banned.  Just came out the other day.
3168 2018-11-30 19:25:46 Intéressant de lire que @Place_Beauvau reconnaît la dangerosité de ses grenades mais décide malgré tout " d écouler ses stocks" bref manifestants qui usez de votre droit constitutionnel à manifester ne venez pas vous plaindre de perdre 1 main cela facilite la gestion de stocks
3169 2018-11-30 19:25:19 Praying there’s at least one pitcher in     each classroom and they can hit their spots. If not, I feel sorry for the students in the front rows.    BREAKING NEWS: Hockey puck stocks rise to an all time high!
3170 2018-11-30 19:24:47 I just LOVED that stocks bottomed on half day Friday when very few were looking for it or believed it. CLASSIC behavior to catch the masses off guard and force the chase.
3171 2018-11-30 19:23:54 Y'all buying socks for Christmas we buying stocks hahaha 
3172 2018-11-30 19:23:34 Just be honest, say you hate Americans. 
Have you stopped purchasing Big Tobacco stocks?
3173 2018-11-30 19:23:29 How about all politicians give up this business where they can buy and sell stocks while doing legislation.
3174 2018-11-30 19:23:25 Which brings up another problem: what about companies that don't have stocks?
3175 2018-11-30 19:22:49 its pretty long, it stretches out to another entrance of the mall. damn fuck school & work  good luck tho! hopefully they were prepared and have more stocks left :)
3176 2018-11-30 19:22:21 Someone update the stocks!!! #BT21Toronto
3177 2018-11-30 19:22:04 I don't think you understand the concept of stocks. My company's stock is currently $124 per share. Unless you own a lot of stocks or the price soars, you're not going to see much of a ROI. And we've only had stocks for the last two years.
3178 2018-11-30 19:21:33 its tax loss selling season. With the vast majority of the small cap weed stocks at or near their lows for the year, they are prime candidates for tax loss selling. Give it another 3 weeks (give or take) and then I think you'll see Buyers begin to step in again. Same every year.
3179 2018-11-30 19:21:27 I track SP500 for retirement, so it’s pretty neat that its 1 year view on the stocks app is virtually in-differentiable from like bitcoin.
3180 2018-11-30 19:20:57 Could cannabis stocks get any more boring today?

3182 2018-11-30 19:20:00 With Trumps's new ban on bump stocks, does that mean he's now done more for gun control than Obama ever did?
3183 2018-11-30 19:18:47 Don't play the penny stocks.
3184 2018-11-30 19:18:03 Finals week: better not see any bump stocks on those pencils
3185 2018-11-30 19:17:06 You must do what is a necessary to block Maxine Waters from destroying the financial sectors. The day she takes over the night before pull your investment from stocks and put in a stable investment.
3186 2018-11-30 19:16:23 IK's views regarding rural economy is being mocked by urban elites/journos n didsidents. In fact, rural economy revolves around live stocks,hens/eggs. Every Kohistani resident earns thrgh live stocks each year. There is little land 4 tilling. Villagers barter eggs/hens 4 items.
3187 2018-11-30 19:15:46 You don't look you belong in stocks! Lol!

3189 2018-11-30 19:13:03 @realDonaldTrump in 2007 the BATFE ruled that they have no jurisdiction or interest in add-ons or accessories when queried about bump stocks.
3190 2018-11-30 19:12:23 #SEC You guys are looking into #Cryptocurrency and the issues that can arise from them, my question is why is it okay for people to have pump and dump schemes on the OTC markets of Stocks? People have been promoting and making money for years with no real regulations, why Crypto?
3191 2018-11-30 19:12:06 I used brushes and kept the style just decided to add some stocks haha ty bro!
3192 2018-11-30 19:11:37 It's not about the stocks, the left wants to take all the guns. The point of the bill is to change the terminology and definitions so they can ban more things in the future. Ever heard the phrase "give an inch and they'll take a mile"?

3200 2018-11-30 19:08:28 If you claim you lost 10k in stocks, and the stock went down 14% in order to have lost 10k you would still have a balance of $71,428.57. This is really simple math
3201 2018-11-30 19:08:20 Can we have any update about the stocks what are the items lieft there as of now? please #BT21Toronto
3202 2018-11-30 19:06:52 ok. So you'll watch these 4 stocks on 15min TF and once a 2-1-2 setup occurs you take it?

3207 2018-11-30 19:03:57 So you might be right! Its damn tempting to get in here. I went 100% cannabis stocks 2 weeks prior to Canadian legalization and that worked nicely. Might be a similar situation in the US now as 2014 Canada. I am looking it over and probably go in hard haha.
3208 2018-11-30 19:03:23 But the narrative is that Big Money has been buying upside equity calls after dumping stocks in Oct/Nov. Why not hedge some of that?

3210 2018-11-30 19:03:02 Stocks swing into the green after Reuters says a Chinese official told them that "consensus is steadily increasing" for a trade deal. Dow +62....the market has been moving on every whisper regarding this weekend's meet between Trump and Jinping
3211 2018-11-30 19:02:53 @traderstewie are you keen on China stocks, baba, bidu, notes,sina, wb, yy etc? Am i reading the charts wrong? They look like 15% moves, would love your expert thoughts. Thx
3212 2018-11-30 19:02:48 @POTUS I see your looking to ban bump stocks. What's next? You gonna ban belt loops, string and rubber bands all can be used to "bumpfire"
3213 2018-11-30 19:02:33 Is that all they can do? Bringing back stocks sounds good right about now...
3214 2018-11-30 19:00:57 Please tell them to make store orders available for the EU and to re-fill stocks, expecially big sizes. I really need that PUBG hoodie and Xbox bomber jacket in 4XL.

3216 2018-11-30 19:00:10 You should review  your politics Ahsan Sb,  the past governments ever ignores little thing with big potential. I am surprised you didn't know the power of live stocks.
3217 2018-11-30 18:59:50 I don't own shares or I would be fully informed! I avoided all US stocks because of federal regs, state line problems for proper scale, capital also tight and 280E tax problems. My interest in US has increased but still have many concerns.
3218 2018-11-30 18:59:21 But at least they outlawed bump stocks, right?
3219 2018-11-30 18:58:50 I appreciate CWood and her band of young analysts so much, instead of buying the individual stocks I pay the fee for owning  their ETF’s
3220 2018-11-30 18:58:29 Sucks to be Marriott right now.  Their stocks plummeted. #MarriottHack
3221 2018-11-30 18:58:26 Or another way of interpreting this is "Hey GS, we've ALREADY had GREATER-than-median returns for stocks in all the lookback periods you mentioned. Ergo, maybe that's about all she wrote!"
3222 2018-11-30 18:58:23 My only real profit is literally in a few MJ stocks (don’t use it) have CGC 200 @ $7.90  ACB 750 @ $.23  CVSI 250 @ $.43. In Aug adj gain  32% started buying BIGGER co’s AMZN ABT BP CRM COST CSCO STZ MSFT WMT TGT KSS PYPL SQ. Then everything went to  & now im  3.5% 
3223 2018-11-30 18:58:12 You can see how I am doing with many stocks can predict up or down. Due to my book “My Favorite Indicator” as it is easy moneymaker around 10% to 20% but if you want more it is up to you.
3224 2018-11-30 18:57:57 Excellent work. I greatly appreciate your tweets and analysis of stocks, and honesty as to your results, a quality severely lacking here on twitter.  Have a great weekend.

Best measure of quality of life for the rest of us is not the stock market reports but: life expectancy, health, housing, education, and weight/height; why not reported like stocks.
3249 2018-11-30 18:47:25 I don’t understand argument that buybacks are good in aggregate, but not good case by case (thus a potential issue). Isn’t this true for anything? Like... cheap stocks are good in aggregate, but some cheap stocks suck? Doesn’t make value investing problematic. 2/2

3252 2018-11-30 18:44:50 People always attracted to extreme points:

Most discussed Stocks : Those delivered 10X in last 1-2 years or Stocks corrected 90-95% coz of management fraud.

So many value opportunities available in between these 2 extreme points.

Ignored Stocks = Value Opportunity.
3253 2018-11-30 18:44:45 This whole fb thing stinks, but this seems unfair. Soros may have been shortselling FB stocks, and then publicly calling them a danger to the world (thereby lowering fb value). Sheryl asks to see if this is the case. Seems like its her job to check it out...
3254 2018-11-30 18:44:40 Investors buy stocks because the Fed is supposedly backing off due to weak data (primarily as a result of trade wars)... Investors today buy stocks bc of small hints that trade wars may be resolved... (Pssst, don't tell them this likely means Fed will no longer "back off") 
3255 2018-11-30 18:44:27 I never invested in pot stocks, and never wanted to. However that does not mean I did not take advantage of pot stocks.

3294 2018-11-30 18:25:57 Great. Now humanity is going to be overrun by ruthless deer because we don't have those patriotic Hunters out there fending them off with their bump stocks. These are the last, dying days of false machismo in America.
3295 2018-11-30 18:25:46 So many businesses in so many different industries are having to make similar and deeply difficult provisions.  The pressure in funding of these buffer stocks is potentially huge and will put so many businesses and supply chains under huge pressures. Cllr Phil Knowles

3298 2018-11-30 18:22:41 Parscale said this is wrong, ban just on newly purchased bump stocks - not prior bought

3301 2018-11-30 18:21:20 If bump stocks can be banned by fiat, then no semi auto is safe.
3302 2018-11-30 18:21:15 Didn’t trump say that he was going to sign something that will ban bump stocks? I mean, I don’t agree on banning bump stocks, but I just want to make sure I didn’t misunderstood the president.
3303 2018-11-30 18:20:54 wtf did i found on garudafood stocks price 
3304 2018-11-30 18:20:49 He is about to ban bump stocks.
3305 2018-11-30 18:20:10 So pichu has a pretty easy 50/50 to end stocks around 130-150 depending on rage
3306 2018-11-30 18:19:27 @zerodhaonline Any calculator for pledge ? Why not make one something like the brokerage calculator. we will know exactly how much we pay for the days we have pledged the stocks.
3307 2018-11-30 18:19:12 They’re the ones that were for sale on the band’s website, now available everywhere (while stocks last)
3308 2018-11-30 18:19:05 Don't forget trashing the economy!
Gyrating Dow.
Layoffs & closings rising.
Inflation up.
Rising interest rates.
Real incomes dropping.
Value of dollar fluctuating.
Massive stocks of unsold soybeans, cars, etc.
Poisoned produce.
500-yr storms annually.
And it's barely even begun.
3309 2018-11-30 18:18:29 Yeah, personally I think bump stocks are useless. But if you allow them to ban that, it is a steep and slippery slope to other bans.

3312 2018-11-30 18:17:41 People, banning bump stocks does nothing to prevent bump firing a weapon. They will have to start amputating fingers and outlaw beltloops & sticks among other things to stop it. Ridiculous, just a ploy to empower government.
3313 2018-11-30 18:17:16 Le pire ce sont les vendeurs de denrées périssables ( fruits et légumes) dont le marché s’est effondré et qui malgré tout ont des stocks qui sont bloqués ou qui ne trouvent plus acquéreurs pour les mêmes raisons  sans compter le week-end de la banque alimentaire annulé

3317 2018-11-30 18:15:30 Unfortunately another down day  0.53%.  CSSG TOT and ZTF the worst of the fallers.  I couldn’t find three blue stocks  but AFM and RFX just about managed it. 

Some small tweaks to switch holdings in the portfolio to add to dividend stocks. 

Enjoy your weekend all 
3318 2018-11-30 18:14:44 i don't have any data to back this up but I feel that most #speculators in the stock markets tend to buy beaten down falling stocks more than "speculating" that new high breakouts will go higher... am I right?
3319 2018-11-30 18:14:42 Without Any Doubt, #G20, #G20Summit would have many Positive steps, incl from #China, onto rolling back Trade Wars, onto .... .....: BUY, #Shares, #Stocks, the most Hit by "#TradeWars"

3326 2018-11-30 18:11:42 This market is stagnating waiting on the results from trade talks. Both PANW and VEEV killed it and the movement in their stocks was weak after few days, but patience is hoe to play it m. Doesn’t FEYE and PANW results look good for OKTA’s earnings report?
3327 2018-11-30 18:11:38 They are hypocrites, straight up! They will say conservative speech is "unhealthy." It's so obvious what their goal is. Conservatives need to leave Twitter, sell their stocks in Twitter and go to a different platform, that is an ACTUAL platform and not a publisher. #bantwitter
3328 2018-11-30 18:11:18 do you even think stocks always stays on top? fool go study again and know that stocks literally change anytime it can
3329 2018-11-30 18:09:47 They will be back buying at the top .  Warren Buffet bought more stocks in 2008 market crash .

3331 2018-11-30 18:07:54 Madam I greatly enjoyed reading this informative article of yours. The P/E data comparison and the case being made on the over-valuation for FMCG stocks is compelling. What’s strange is pharma is the new cyclical being beaten up.
3332 2018-11-30 18:07:28 Look at stocks that are down on wall st, all chinese or china proxies that are listed on US stock exchanges. For example yesterdays big losers on wall st include jojos chinese drug store. The economy is doing well because of tariffs and will collapse if we allow china to run amok
3333 2018-11-30 18:07:14 Taylor Swift is making a massive sale on her merchandise to clear all of the stocks and released some limited edition stuffs but I can't even afford to purchase one of them + they gave a free shipping worldwide but I had to spend at least RM300 to get free shipping :').The pain..

Thanks, always helpful
3336 2018-11-30 18:05:06 The Trump administration is preparing to officially ban bump stocks on guns, a move that would end sales of the attachments that allow semiautomatic rifles to fire faster.
3337 2018-11-30 18:05:05 1) Too late. Bump stocks are already owned by domestic terrorists.

2) Is there a fine/punishment with teeth for defiance? Such as a 5-10 year revocation if gun license and gun possession?
3338 2018-11-30 18:04:09 speed stocks
3339 2018-11-30 18:03:01 Wait till they find out we can 3-D print bump stocks XD
3340 2018-11-30 18:01:47 Yes should be around 5% ! Still these stocks have underperformed Nifty
3341 2018-11-30 18:01:24 Biotech exciting, biotech stocks well  quite the opposite.

3343 2018-11-30 18:00:25 If you think he’s bowing down to Democrats then you don’t know who Donald Trump is. Trump is dealing with Democrats as the President should. A president with your mentality would get nothing done. Bump stocks are useless. From a conservative.

3346 2018-11-30 18:00:02 *picking stocks* not the same thing as trading. active trading does give you immediate feedback and the best performers practice for thousands hours...
3347 2018-11-30 17:59:49 Will also do a video review of 50+ stocks. New leaders, charts of interest, bellwether stocks. Some like quick reviews, only spending 30 seconds discussing each chart. This weekend's video will be for you.

3349 2018-11-30 17:58:57 Oh the move speed being part of the damage is great to know, looking forward to more ways to delete stocks off stage
3350 2018-11-30 17:57:46 started adding few shares like Parag Milk..CARE..Cadila health..whatever political drama is, such stocks are not prone to political environment..sticking to SIP mode
3351 2018-11-30 17:57:42 Who constantly stocks buttermilk in their fridge!?!?!  
3352 2018-11-30 17:56:35 No! Dorking. But she stocks a lot of French items.
3353 2018-11-30 17:55:29 Hi there Juan Carlos, thanks for your interest in our products! Unfortunately availability at this moment is remains low, but we are working really hard to replenish stocks. Keep up to date for the latest availability via our webshop.
3354 2018-11-30 17:55:20 Don't we also have to distinguish between different types/tiers of shareholders? As I understand it, the richest 10% of US households now owns a huge proportion of the value of US stocks. Even if returns on their stocks are modest, they would be doing gangbusters.
3355 2018-11-30 17:53:37 Thanks also. Interesting..."The current stock amounts to approx. 1000 animals in Germany, approx. 150 animals in Austria and approx. 250 animals in Switzerland. These stocks can be traced back to a few individuals. "
3356 2018-11-30 17:53:22 Yes and it caused steel stocks to drop due to steel overcapacity
3357 2018-11-30 17:53:19 I don't think you understand what stocks are.

Paying down debt (corporate, personal, or govt) always strengthens the debtor & protects those who belong to those groups.

A company buying back its own stock is a good move for both owners & employees.
3358 2018-11-30 17:52:03 @HFTAlert I have been following ROKU for some time, got out before the big drop. Yes, agree can't just blindly buy. I would look to use your tool on strong stocks in strong sectors. Trying to get consistent in this game.
3359 2018-11-30 17:51:59 Exactly.

Anyone's disposable when it comes down to corporate execs keeping bonuses

Like how the gov't used billions of citizen tax $ to bail out GM, and they used it to buy back their own stocks to bolster their own portfolios then STILL closed factories, laid off thousands etc

3363 2018-11-30 17:51:16 @realDonaldTrump the ATF has reviewed bump stocks twice, the people have spoken for them once and they have never been linked to a crime? what exactly is your play here, to not get re elected, please stay on the course you promised.

3367 2018-11-30 17:49:53 Wouldn’t dividend be a significant portion of total returns for these stocks?
3368 2018-11-30 17:49:46 You never said anything? Capitalism doesn’t work, this has been proved time and time again from tulips to stocks; we always have crashes where those that could pay taxs, abide by the law and work hard suffer the most. They lose jobs,homes, life however those that caused it R fine
3369 2018-11-30 17:49:14 I know it is a fool's hope, but as EA, Ubisoft and ActiBlizz stocks have seen a major drop, maybe shareholders would hold shitty business practices and managers responsible. But as I said, a fool's hope...

Very upset. The last 3 yrs show NO GC more import than ever.

3390 2018-11-30 17:39:45 Wow! You’re not as dumb as we thought! “So we’re knocking out bump stocks,’’ the president said during a news conference announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada. “I’ve told the NRA. I’ve told them: Bump stocks are gone.’’
3391 2018-11-30 17:39:40 @RepJerryNadler Hillary Clinton should be indicted. President Trump has done nothing but help this country and he doesn't even take a salary and you dare to talk impeachment? For what, the great economy?  Our stocks going up? Putting our embassy in Jerusalem?

3408 2018-11-30 17:31:42 Now, if that goes through, the next step is to install a process where modifications get full and complete consideration before the are deemed safe, necessary, and legal. Bump stocks were simply an obvious attempt to circumvent regulations regarding automatic weapons.

3411 2018-11-30 17:30:43 $NBR picked up a long position at 3.27. A 50% drop in about a month.

Still plenty of work for the services stocks, and certainly worth a risk half price sale.

When you see industry stocks going up by 1000-1400%, premiums up by 100-150%, huge deductibles & the overall quality of care down, the American people are being ripped off, as is Medicaid

3424 2018-11-30 17:23:35 Hey @DLoesch, looks like @realDonaldTrump is going to sign a bill on making bump stocks illegal. Though I don't own one, it is just one more thing to erode our #2A. Your thoughts?
3425 2018-11-30 17:23:34 So have you been long stocks the whole time? It's not overly difficult to see bubbles. We lived through 10 years of ZIRP, so of course capital gets allocated in a bubble format to other assets. Timing is key. History says there will be another sell-off, but when and what to do?
3426 2018-11-30 17:23:15 Yep agree, stocks are done.

3435 2018-11-30 17:17:31 Bump stocks are just a gimmick. They don’t make a person a better shooter. My humble opinion.

3545 2018-11-30 16:35:02 Banning bump stocks is a feel-good policy that does not accomplish anything. Like banning straws and tariffs. Stop the nonsense.
3546 2018-11-30 16:34:39 Maybe $tlry insiders know Trump is going threaten to veto the farm bill. That's why their stock never recurved a bump like the other stocks did in the sector.
3547 2018-11-30 16:33:50 Mr Trump Banning bump stocks? Better think that one over better, Maybe you don’t want to be a second term president?  Don’t fold for those evil People on the dark side.
3548 2018-11-30 16:33:38 Not fully convinced the dude was telling anything close to the truth, but I do know that kids flip accounts like penny stocks. The concept is real
3549 2018-11-30 16:33:02 Can you tell me how do you rank your stocks you have screened? Do you have an article on this? thanks

3552 2018-11-30 16:32:33 Sort of like investors in individual stocks v. a broadly diversified fund.
3553 2018-11-30 16:32:15 We have pineapple pizza. Stocks go higher.
3554 2018-11-30 16:32:05 Lol i remembered, i was in the mall the day they announced that it was sold out and there were still a lot of stocks
3555 2018-11-30 16:31:39 Corker got it but in the end he gave up. I don't blame him. The system has really punished people that use logic the last 6 years.  I guess we got hyperinflation in the one asset that no one really wanted stocks.
3556 2018-11-30 16:31:06 *bans bump stocks*

3563 2018-11-30 16:29:55 When trading options, I trade options on indexes ($spx, $ndx, $rut, etc.) and usually stay away from options on individual stocks. You can get hurt pretty badly if a company does something stupid and it rocks their stock price. $TSLA

3565 2018-11-30 16:29:25 Demand is from pension & insurance funds. And makes sense. When you manage lakh crore assets for long term you really don't want to look at any safe options beyond these tired and tested businesses.

3572 2018-11-30 16:24:24 Watch your picket book. Sell your stocks and hide. We are under Liberal Arrest. Freedom is no longer. We are under Marshal Law. DOJ is breaking down Doors. No one is Safe.
3573 2018-11-30 16:24:16 Original Jordan’s do not go for less than $80 on a bad day. 
So anyone selling you “brand new” Jordan’s for 4500/- is lying. 90% of what we have here are fake. 
Resellers are making way more than the original offering price because of stocks running out.
3574 2018-11-30 16:23:57 @realDonaldTrump you were voted in by supporting our constitutional rights on the 2nd Amendment. Banning bump stocks is going against our rights. Is this #MAGA only by your standards?

3583 2018-11-30 16:20:53 Aye, them RTA people be going through the most. I’m pretty sure they alone keep Newport stocks afloat.
3584 2018-11-30 16:20:21 I was there as well and buying stocks below cash in the bank with no debt and positive cash flow. Like a good capitalist should. Up all night trying to figure out if my clearing firm was going out of business and whether our dollar was worthless holding Hong Kong dollars instead.
3585 2018-11-30 16:20:17 Instead of pushing for national reciprocity like he promised while asking for our votes, the president is now pushing HARD for the extremely flawed ERPO law, and a national ban AND most likely the subsequent confiscation of bump stocks. Yup, he sure loves the 2A like he claimed.

3588 2018-11-30 16:19:02 No question that the valuation math supports stocks at current RF rates and earnings growth.   The market wonders if Mr. Powell understands global disinflation and how this cycle which has new variables in play vs the 80's & 90's is one where inflation is a low probability risk.

3609 2018-11-30 16:12:00 When I’m trading stocks my intent is to cover my monthly expenses with capital gains. My smallest bill is 5$ so I make sure my gains cover that. Then I attack the next highest bill, until I technically grow my portfolio enough to cover my entire cost of living.
3610 2018-11-30 16:11:12 I have a real hard time believing bump stocks were very widely sold/used. Seems like a stupid thing to be politicized/argued about while we ignore real problems like our insane national debt

3614 2018-11-30 16:08:41 def these Chinese stocks. It could be just shorts taking profits into these meetings. That would make a lot of sense.
3615 2018-11-30 16:08:29 Shouldn't owners be compensated? Hopefully that will be an option. If your town wanted to exercise imminent domain to build a road through your yard, wouldn't you expect to be fairly compensated for your property? This applies to bump stocks as well.
3616 2018-11-30 16:07:55 Yeah well, WE have stocks, too but we ALSO have a conscience & Soul. When we ALL do well .... ALL profit. 50 BILLION on the backs of Families Lives- all so we can have another Vacation sours in the Stomach. No thank you -
3617 2018-11-30 16:07:10 This is terrible.  

Bump stocks are dangerous toys, but this is confiscation by executive fiat. 

The NFA machine gun definition is clear "by a single function of the trigger".

The right way to handle bump stocks is to pass legislation and not throw out the rule of law.

3620 2018-11-30 16:05:01 Not seeing much freakout over bump stocks being banned since it's GOP 'coming for the guns'. Almost like it isn't really about 2A and that a gun lobby doesn't represent the American people.
3621 2018-11-30 16:04:14 What happens if people don't surrender their bump stocks? How is the government going to know if  all bump stocks have been surrendered?
3622 2018-11-30 16:03:31 Is "vast majority of stock traders doing no better than chance" really a proof that the stock trading is mostly a game of pure luck? 
One big difference between trading stocks and other games is that a small number of winners can play against a huge number of losers.  1/2

3628 2018-11-30 16:02:30 Bump firing is a technique not a device. It is hugely inaccurate and makes any weapon less effective. Bump stocks are range toys. If the LV shooter had NOT used a bump stock probably more people would have been hurt.

3632 2018-11-30 15:58:57 With obvious professional advice like this, I'm convinced I could be market analyst: “High quality stocks with large balance sheets in all sectors that have predictable cash flows are going to outperform the overall market.”
3633 2018-11-30 15:58:48 The falsehood is that a taxcut was given to help employees. Majority of that mony is used for buying back stocks for these corporations. And for what? To create a huge deficit that youre going to have to pay for to make it up, yes, you. Not the corporations.

3637 2018-11-30 15:57:33 Workers have the ability to buy stocks and therefor receive dividends and also sell them back.
3638 2018-11-30 15:57:21 Yes, no doubt.I've come back from being down 20% on $ACB but I feel this decline is different. lots of sectors overall in the stock market are hurting. Good news isn't making pot stocks pop as it did a month ago. I am being patient at the moment.very tempting at these prices tho.

3647 2018-11-30 15:50:57 Seriously though.... look at the cloud stocks like $CRM $WDAY $VMW $SPLK $OKTA $NEWR etc ... they seem to be leading the recovery in tech, no?
3648 2018-11-30 15:50:41 Healthcare up to about 28% from 9.5%, Communication up to around 12% from 5%... lots of rotation in momentum. A downside to this form of MO is it shifts defensively after stocks fall causing it to lag on the upside, but in large declines, those stocks fall, too.
3649 2018-11-30 15:49:52 China's economic vital signs continuing to contract though recent move up in equities may help consumer spending tick a bit higher- Trump has to feel pretty emboldened esp as US stocks moving higher- wondering how he takes all of this into account into the "big dinner"...

3653 2018-11-30 15:48:05 Market knows it is a powell bec stocks are absurdly priced.  Sadly j6p will eventually bear the brunt of all this.  They can delay it but they cannot prevent it.  Ultimately mean reversion will happen regardless of cb’s.
3654 2018-11-30 15:47:54 It would have to not be fully automatic and bump stocks would absolutely need to be regulated. I mean do we even care about children if we don’t. :)
3655 2018-11-30 15:47:46 Circulating In the news is that @realDonaldTrump is going to ban bump stocks. This is an infringement on my second amendment rights #2A .

3664 2018-11-30 15:43:09 what is your favorite time pair to trade stocks? If different comment
3665 2018-11-30 15:42:57 Not that i care about bump stocks but shouldn't owners be compensated for turning them in to law enforcement? After all, owners spent their hard earned money on them, the government should buy them back.
3666 2018-11-30 15:42:38 Am I the only one who wants the markets to remain at this price level for a long time? 

We have already took the mental hit from the market corrections anyway so wouldn’t it be better for the markets to remain cheap so that you can buy stocks cheaper with your monthly paycheck?
3667 2018-11-30 15:42:13 Hi Mark, are you still recommending individual traders to hold at most 4 to 5 stocks at a time for concentration?
3668 2018-11-30 15:41:10 stocks up, crypto down...lol...way to go bulls
3669 2018-11-30 15:40:51 No I don’t agree.  Ppl need to make a conservative platform so we can get our views out.  If they regulate Twitter & Facebook all Conservatives views will be labeled as hate speech & then as we see now not one single Liberal & Democrat account got blocked. Sell stocks of the two
3670 2018-11-30 15:40:27 Crap. There's an expression for how you can't predict things where knowing the prediction ahead of time affects said prediction. e.g. stocks, the price of oil, etc. Basically anything involving human decision making (and prediction). I can't remember what that expression was.

3677 2018-11-30 15:39:14 Trump’s tax policies—that don’t give working people a break, but breaks to corporations and rich people, who use it to buy stocks or buy back stocks—and his trade wars and tariffs, which are driving companies out of the US and ruining small biz and farmers—indicate a huge crash.

3682 2018-11-30 15:37:24 Well that game is 5 stocks so it doesn't mean as much, also every character kills you off a hit so it's far more balanced

3735 2018-11-30 15:13:56 Trading is not an on/off business. It's about making incremental shifts, sometimes big, most of the time small. As you transition from cash to stocks, you do so one stock at a time and build exposure into the market, but only on the heels of previous success. Otherwise, you wait.

3819 2018-11-30 14:44:52 Well, first, the ETF follows the MSCI USA Momentum Index. The ETF prospectus discloses the calculation as does MSCI. We can determine which stocks will be added/deleted and their weighting for the index. The only assumption left, then, is how closely they match it to MTUM.
3820 2018-11-30 14:44:22 Please advise your dad not to start messing with Americans firearms by banning & confiscating accessories. He’s going to lose a lot of supporters by opening this door. The ATF has already made their ruling on bump stocks and said they do not turn a semi-auto into full.

3874 2018-11-30 14:27:28 Bump stocks do not mimic FA guns anymore than holding the gun loosely or using a belt loop.  Even if they did, so what?  FA fire is not used frequently because of the cost of ammo alone.  Deliberate, aimed fire will always be more effective than spraying and praying.
3875 2018-11-30 14:26:49 There are ways to make money by “pinning”. Which I am pretty good at. But I won’t ever run the risk of being assigned, exercised or own stock. Well unless it’s in my sons acct or some blockchain stocks.  So it’s BTO STC for me.

3886 2018-11-30 14:20:29 Yes everyone owns all the stocks, but IP is an asset of a company. If the theory is that "well IP can't be owned/controlled by a company" you get into a lot of murky waters about whether a company can control any asset, and how that'd work under a competitive setting.

3914 2018-11-30 14:05:49 @TMFJMo Jason, question that I’ve been mulling over and would like your take on:  when you get to the point that there aren’t many stocks that you would like to add at the current moment, whether because the stocks I love are already heavy in my portfolio or
3915 2018-11-30 14:05:32 Real wages are down 
Stocks are down
Trade debt is exploding 
Inflation is rising
The dollar is falling
Interest rates are up 
Home sales are down
Basically you suck at being president
3916 2018-11-30 14:04:46 By nature, stocks in ETF cannot be changed. They have to buy and hold the CPSE stocks.

3919 2018-11-30 14:03:07 If #Trump and #XI manage to walk and chew gum without falling down, stocks will mindlessly cheer!  It's what they do.  #Fakemarkets
3920 2018-11-30 14:03:04 Apologize for what?  Asking you a question?  Why do you or your "analysts" make calls on stocks that aren't tradable on your platform?
3921 2018-11-30 14:02:37 That's a different discussion though. Btw, do fund managers pick stocks successfully? :)
Point is, retailer has little chance in stock picking. mf (active or index) is the only way. Better it is an index fund
3922 2018-11-30 14:02:37 If you want success as a stock trader, just learn how to spot correct stock setups. That's really what it comes down to. Stop trying to figure out where the "market" is going. The Dow is not the market! Individual stocks make up the market and there are more than just 30 or 500.

3924 2018-11-30 14:01:43 How can gold go down if stocks get down...they should be inversely correlated.
3925 2018-11-30 14:01:24 Hi.. Where can I get data about November month roll over data? Stocks and sector wise?
3926 2018-11-30 14:00:57 I don’t hate guns. I believe in the 2nd amendment. HOWEVER I do believe we need stricter gun laws and should screen every person that tries to buy one. Also we don’t need bump stocks and Machine guns to live every day lives
3927 2018-11-30 14:00:43 Totally Agree.  While the Precious Metals Miners are currently out of favor, when the broader markets, tech stocks and real estate head south in a BIG WAY, the miners will be one of the few places to enjoy gains.

3943 2018-11-30 13:52:53 Crypto was touted as an investment with no positive correlation to the stock market. However, it's rise occurred during one of the, if not THE greatest bull market in stocks ever and the drop in crypto has happened during a yearlong stock downtrend.

3951 2018-11-30 13:50:23 They would have to sell off personal assets and fixed assets (i.e. means of production) because they would be too costly to transport or not worth the effort.

They can’t make profit off things such as capital gains and stocks if they don’t exist anymore.

3956 2018-11-30 13:45:52 @HalftimeReport  I see some changes on CNBC for next year. I hope Steve Weiss will be dropped as he is a worthless contributor & knows little about stocks & trading. His track record will prove my point after watching HT daily.
3957 2018-11-30 13:45:06 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 14 stocks Thursday including $IQV, $DLTR and  $MDR.   Top performer was a same-day gain of 85% in $TWTR where November 31.0 calls bought for $0.30 closed at $0.56.
3958 2018-11-30 13:44:46 BRK is largely comprised of value stocks which have not been the best performers this cycle. The company, as an insurer, has a ton of cash. Returns on cash have been suppressed by the Fed. Very little exposure to FAANG. Biggest mistake, IMO.

3960 2018-11-30 13:43:49 1st you only think they were wrong because you don't like bump stocks, not because you actually read the law.

The NFA is very clear and defines a machine gun as multiple shots by 1 activation of the trigger.  A bump stock allows fast trigger activation.  IE not a machinge gun.
3961 2018-11-30 13:42:40 I see your point, but Russell 3000 (aka US stocks) *tripled* last decade.

I’m definitely not crying for investors who got in Q1 09, which in a month will be 10y. That’s a compounding 12% return (nominal) this last decade.
3962 2018-11-30 13:42:30 Just focus on making stocks go up
3963 2018-11-30 13:42:15 was that a Stocks pound cake?

Michael L. Burke
3973 2018-11-30 13:36:53 Go ahead and ban your bump stocks. I still possess belt loops and opposable thumbs!
3974 2018-11-30 13:36:20 Previously administration allowed bump stocks saying not fully automatic, i believe they were wrong.  In order to ban them only have to change the regulation but requires due process to do it.  Not sure a new law is required.

3982 2018-11-30 13:28:19 The 70s bear market in stocks and bonds was because of interest rates. There was no wage inflation, increases in wages were outpaced by rising prices.

3996 2018-11-30 13:19:15 I have not said that purchasing a house isnt profitable. I said "on the totem pole of lucrative investments it is very VERY low." The $27m I would have to spend to buy a $18m house over 20 yrs would give me MUCH huger returns than 400% in 20 yrs if I invested it in stocks instead
3997 2018-11-30 13:19:13 #Stocks :  El Euro Stoxx cayó hasta 3,167, el #FSTE 100 descendió hasta 6,993. Mientras tanto el #DAX alemán se recupera en la apertura y abre en verde.

3999 2018-11-30 13:18:15 Don't forget about him bragging about the stock market, something 50% of Americans aren't involved in, and 83% of all stocks are owned by just 1% of the population. This is how we got the orange idiot and why people don't vote.

4003 2018-11-30 13:15:21 So, my advice is to keep playing defense (maintain higher cash levels, favor value over growth, stick with #SafeMoney sectors vs. overvalued, overhyped, overowned #FAANG and #tech stocks, hedge, etc.). Defense won the game for Dallas last night & it should win the "game" for you!

4008 2018-11-30 13:12:57 Well I have to disagree with you about no money left in the tech sector. Any dip now will be an opportunity in years to come. The FAANG stocks can buy into any future tech wave. Whether its AR, BTC or a sector that doesn’t exist yet. But yes, marijuana is still in its infancy.

4018 2018-11-30 13:03:55 See month of October. FAANG stocks down 12%, broad S&P 500 down 10%. Investors don’t understand that the upside momentum spurred by indexing via largest cap stocks works in reverse on downside rendering fee savings irrelevant.
4019 2018-11-30 13:03:41 Par ailleurs, pour vous expliquer plus précisément, les stocks magasin et site sont différenciés. Il se peut que le magasin n'ait pas de stock et que le site en ait encore.

4021 2018-11-30 13:03:18 Isn’t “the last 2 decades” weighted down by 2000-2008? 2009-2018, the last decade, has done quite well for US stocks.

Is there a difference between the last decade and the prior 2 (or 3), if we reverse it and stick prior decades with crappy 2000-2008 years?

4038 2018-11-30 12:58:52 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I implore you to reconsider signing the unconstitutional EO concerning bump stocks and the 90 day limit on owners destroying or surrendering them. Don't throw away your support among 2nd Amendment defenders in these trying times.

4045 2018-11-30 12:55:28 @NARSCosmetics Very disappointed in the UK Cyber Monday promo of 3 free mini products plus 20% discount.  When I received my order, there were no free mini items and no paperwork at all.  Response from CS was that as per T&Cs it was 'only whilst stocks lasted'.  Not good enough.

It brought it so many general sports fans in to boxing but I'm glad we can now move on. But Aus stocks are shallow. Its been so long since we've had a long term world champ. Who fills that?

4065 2018-11-30 12:45:37 In case there was some confusion I don’t think it’s ok (I do think they’re stupid) the argument I’ve been making is that the political calculus of banning bump stocks is only upside for trump, and if they actually work a deal for national CC reciprocity it’s a deal I’d make also

4070 2018-11-30 12:42:05 Why does the price of stocks or even prices drop? The market forces of demand and supply, change in regulation, increased user acceptance/adoption, economic events. These things can also affect #cryptocurrencies

4081 2018-11-30 12:36:05 Why buy crypto stocks? They are too correlated to the BTC movements. Same cycle,and they most probably move a lot less than the token/coin itself. I mean you are better off buying the coins as usual...

4100 2018-11-30 12:23:46 Hey there! We don't currently have XRP on the timeline-- but that doesn't mean we won't! There's a lot involved in adding stocks and crypto, so there's no definitive answer on this one as of yet.
4101 2018-11-30 12:20:50 Hi Michael! We currently don't have XRP on our timeline, but that doesn't mean that we won't add it in the future. Unfortunately, we can't give a solid answer on this one-- as crypto and stocks are on a case-by-case basis.

4150 2018-11-30 11:33:54 U.S. stocks closes lower on Thursday 11/29/2018. $DJIA -0.11% at 25,338.84, $SPX -0.22% at 2,737.76, $COMPQ -0.25% at 7,273.08, $RUT -0.33% at $1525.39.
4151 2018-11-30 11:32:36 I agree. This applies to stocks that were already cleared. Imagine you clear 5mln Litres and you don't collect until next week. When you sell it, you include 7c that you never paid

Banning Bump Stocks is just an emotional reaction. It's never good to make decisions just using emotions for reasoning. I thought only Progressives did that.
4157 2018-11-30 11:27:16 I really don’t like how I’ve been pressured to put my money into long term investment accts to save for my retirement while I know nothing about stocks & when I get statements, I see thousands of dollars of my hard earned money being lost to who knows what. What is this system??

4169 2018-11-30 11:14:09 Further to improve probability and assymetric return on investment I'm thinking of a new simple rule that is to analyse stocks going in for price contraction by 2.30 pm and buy around 3pm for positional trade instead of entering when it's breaking out . Let's see how it works.

4174 2018-11-30 11:03:55 Aim makes zero sense. Stocks can go 100-200% in a day on no solid news.
Then you have a share with news that has been outstanding for years and it’s hardly moved. AEG has been 4p within last 6 months as well
4175 2018-11-30 11:03:50 Bumps stocks don’t actually make a gun “auto” as you phrased it. They just make the gun more accurate and stable.
4176 2018-11-30 11:03:20 @brucebusiness what is the reason RMI stocks down, I mean I have lost alot on my stock in the past week. 27%. I need help
4177 2018-11-30 11:02:44 Yeah, this reminds me and something I said about trades being boring. Maybe if you're trading stocks, but there's NOTHING boring about being in a futures trade. I suspect the people really saying these things are investor's, not traders. Then both comments make more sense.
4178 2018-11-30 11:02:34 Banks & big companies have been buying back their own stocks for years. They want a crisis so that they can blame something else other than their greed & incompetence. 2008 never went away, kicked down the road. EU control means they will initiate "bail-ins" like Cypress. Beware!

I don’t personally use an AR-15 but it is still a popular home defense weapon. 3. No one uses ar15 hunt. Bump stocks yes.

4409 2018-11-30 07:57:33 Averaging works only in a basket of stocks like a large cap fund or index fund. I had posted a very good way to do that by investing in debt and index funds based on NIFTY PE ratio.

4411 2018-11-30 07:55:04 Guy, you already shared this. Thanks. I get it. I'm telling you how to get what you want. You want to stop THIS. Bump stocks are a separate issue we can use as a lever to upset this and any future attempts of this type.

4413 2018-11-30 07:52:51 As you know I bought shares of $Z at 32,5$ this last Tuesday . They have had a terrible last 2 ER going -20% each. But what made me decide to buy them is the confidence of their board last Monday buying a huge amount of stocks .Also after Powell talking about neutral rates help.

4424 2018-11-30 07:41:41 Obama’s metric for success is like judging a patient’s recovery from a heart attack by how quickly they can resume eating cheeseburgers. And what did deporting millions, Romneycare & boosting stocks win him politically, if Republicans still think he’s an open borders socialist?
4425 2018-11-30 07:36:23 3. Bump stocks don’t actually physically modify the gun give you bullets or anything. They just make you more accurate. People use them for hunting. 
4. The AR-15 is actually a common home defense weapon.

4440 2018-11-30 07:23:26 I have realised the importance of having liquid funds. People commonly worship market linked products as a savings instruments but very few talk about liquidity and its importance. You never really know when to cash out and use your money if all you have is MFs and stocks.
4441 2018-11-30 07:22:32 People really out here passionate about stocks?
4442 2018-11-30 07:22:28 Actually, the key phrase is "it is mathematically impossible to do the same with bitcoin".

Nobody has made the claim that you can't lose money on stocks. The actual claim being made has nothing to do with stocks. The claim is that on average, you will lose money on bitcoin.
4443 2018-11-30 07:21:04 That's also because they invest mostly in stocks that drive the indices, not the broader market.
4444 2018-11-30 07:20:16 The next few days will be one of the most critical moments for stocks for the past decade since the housing bubble crash. Whatever happens during the G20 will decide if we see a -15% tank from here or +15% new all-time highs by mid next year for the Nasdaq (about +/-12% for S&P).

4449 2018-11-30 07:15:35 See, there ya go. Perfect example. We give bump stocks, then use it's legal wording to purposefully build an inroad. Meaning that it would specifically exclude these types of overreach by naming them as allowable expressions of 2A. You fight THIS battle by negotiating the

4475 2018-11-30 06:48:12 It’d certainly help in the long run. High capacity magazines, ar-15s/high caliber guns, and bump stocks should all be banned or have restrictions, regulations, strict background checks and all kinds of stuff to make it hard as hell to get.

4518 2018-11-30 06:12:50 Bump stocks can achieve rates of fire between 400 to 800 rounds per minute depending on the gun. So, in getting a semi-auto long gun to behave more like a fully auto long gun, yeah. Rates are altered.
4519 2018-11-30 06:11:47 For me PM stocks are not doom hedges, They are my main course. I am out of India markets since Nov 17 and my PF has only gold, silver, diamond and platinum miners & explorers ( a few base/EV/U plays also ) , I know I will make the moolah latest by Jan - March 2021.

4529 2018-11-30 06:05:11 You like pm's as doom hedges, for when stocks/bonds struggle?  Seems to me there's very cheap silver leverage plays that still project to maybe be 2nd quartile, despite it being a by-product.  Graphite is a lol - every NPV/IRR is awesome b/c they just assume high basket prices.
4530 2018-11-30 06:05:10 I have a hunch that a lot of PSU stocks are falling without any news flows as investors are simply selling the underlying stocks and investing in the CPSE ETF. There could be a recovery coming next week in these stocks.

4590 2018-11-30 05:14:44 “Last quarter” was 3rd Q — June, July, August.  Since then, interest rates increased a bit, stocks have fallen (but recovered after the Fed announced no immediate interest rate increases), so what will the 4th Q be?  We won’t know until 1/19, but keep riding the bandwagon.

4602 2018-11-30 05:04:50 Because I've been trading stocks for close to 15 years and have always consistently made strong returns. Because the inflated cost of a house isn't important unless you actually unlock the value.

4619 2018-11-30 04:47:14 Lists and do it. It doesn’t sound like much, but trust and believe if we all stuck together, and left. Their stocks would take a bigger hit. We need to now. #TwitterBlackout #BoycottTwitter #TwitterSucks

4621 2018-11-30 04:45:53 I totally get it. The problem is stocks dont. We have seen it happen before. In fact we have seen stocks get tremendous gains even after yield curve inversions, longest period of returns after inversion was in 78. Bull went on another 2 years and markets rose over 40%.
4622 2018-11-30 04:43:39 apple stocks rise by 35%.

4627 2018-11-30 04:38:38 My rough calculation suggests that over the past year, the household sector has lost about half a trillion dollars in wealth (around 25% of GDP) as house prices and stocks have fallen... Interestingly, the RBA is unconcerned  #RBAfail

4638 2018-11-30 04:33:53 @RepThomasMassie and @justinamash we need you guys to stand up to the executive branch overstepping it’s authority on the issue of banning bump stocks. Keep bump sticks legal!!
4639 2018-11-30 04:33:21 3/ it's time the stocks and pillories and display of the Public Square were revitalized, to bring SHAME back into the arena of punishment-as-entertainment.  and not just Trump -- all his cohorts, minions; hell, everyone who needs to be shamed.  judicially applied, of course.
4640 2018-11-30 04:31:53 Tesla stocks are so overpriced... but that’s a good thing 
4641 2018-11-30 04:29:26 The dollar was on tenterhooks Friday before a meeting of U.S. and Chinese leaders to discuss contention trade issues that might provide a catalyst for the near-term direction of riskier assets such as stocks and safe havens including the greenback and the yen.
4642 2018-11-30 04:28:48 It's cool .

I know.

I'm not married to any of these stocks but it's funny when they don't move straight away some people can't wait to have a crack. Without the emojis.

Slow day for me too . Everyone seems petrified Donald is going to throw wine over Xi Ping
4643 2018-11-30 04:28:40 Buy stocks.
4644 2018-11-30 04:28:38 If you don't study any companies, you have the same success buying stocks as you do in a poker game if you bet without looking at your cards...

4653 2018-11-30 04:24:45 Wasn't it nice of president Trump to ban them considering the Obama administration legalized the sale of bump stocks on at least two occasions.
4654 2018-11-30 04:22:42 Hilarious that bump stocks owned by people are being told to get rid of them.

4656 2018-11-30 04:21:26 What @kraushopper was trying to tell @BeckyQuick was that since he is already invested in the stocks and with slowing growth and heightened volatility and uncertainty, he may be better off doing trading with options in the short term with cash instead of duplicating his portfolio
4657 2018-11-30 04:20:32 And it is just a fact of life that stocks priced under $5 do strange things. But look at StockTwits - even the paid touts are fading away. $MDXG

4661 2018-11-30 04:18:23 There's a difference between picking stocks and voting on shareholder issues that, more often than not, can be summarized as "best practices".  And practically speaking, most investors outsource their decisions to ISS and the like.
4662 2018-11-30 04:18:14 To answer your question Mr. Obama I am complaing about climate change ending life as we know it on planet earth. The stocks will probably take a hit so not a good long term investment strategy.

4669 2018-11-30 04:16:00 Yep! The corporate CEOs are subsidizing their own workers! Buying back their stocks, giving themselves raises, cashing in millions each year all the while laying off the very workforce that afforded them their ability to leech. #CorporateGreed

Market Live: Sensex extends gains to over 170 points, Nifty well above 10,900; Yes Bank up 6%. Consumption, IT and energy stocks are in the green, while the Nifty Auto index is showing some negative bias.
4673 2018-11-30 04:14:47 A bump stock is not a gun. If you think banning bump stocks is in any way banning guns or failing to protect the 2nd amendment, you're simply an idiot.

4682 2018-11-30 04:11:47 Whether or not I agree with bump stocks or not is irrelevant.

If you agree to arbitrarily bans on X, you also agree to bans on X ₁ and X ₂ and X ₃.

You’re agreeing to give up your rights with the hope the rights you like will be taken from you last.
4683 2018-11-30 04:11:44 They’re about to ban bump stocks???

4687 2018-11-30 04:08:04 Superior #investing doesn’t come from buying high quality assets, but from when the deal is good, the price is low, the potential return is substantial, and the risk is limited. Howard Marks #stocks
4688 2018-11-30 04:05:55 This is great, but... trump tweets on bump stocks in about a year, nothing in his State of the Union -- trump made no attempt to push for a permanent legislative ban. Kind of like he's been sitting on this until he really, really needed a boost. Like now.

4697 2018-11-30 03:59:53 Anyone can make a bump stock using tin from a coke can. I hope the law was written to to prohibit all bump stock & similar apparatus, not just bump stocks, or the law is useless.
4698 2018-11-30 03:59:28 So bump stocks can be removed from possession. Good thing but remember Dems aren't taking your guns, gop are.
4699 2018-11-30 03:59:09 The thing about stocks is that they don't always follow the patterns they should. If they did valuations would tell us everything we need to know. You could see flat earnings and still have multiple expansion. If demand shifts to bonds/CDs it will lower yields and reverse demand

They gave him every chance to come around, but instead he blocked me. Good riddance.

4716 2018-11-30 03:49:34 LOL Mark the pussy blocked me.

I will state it another way, Mark blocked a guy that believes exactly the same way he does on pretty much every issue, but who wouldn’t tow the line on a tantrum he was throwing about bump stocks.
4717 2018-11-30 03:49:33 @russellcrowe   What a tasty line of guys in those stocks. Really that's kinda sexy. A helpless man with us  Russell lovers.  A dirty mind is a terrible thing to waste.

4719 2018-11-30 03:46:31 If rates weren’t rising, I would agree with you. But stocks are not only fighting tough YOY comparables, but rising rates will make bonds/CDs more attractive on top of slowing demand. And it’s not just domestic. I’m not sure earnings expectations are low enough. Hope I’m wrong.
4720 2018-11-30 03:46:30 It’s impossible for Vanguard to own all stocks. There has to be a more active group of investors to create the liquidity for those who want to be less active.

4735 2018-11-30 03:40:45 I agree completely Monty. The only thing I would note is stocks don't need great data to do well. Only need data to beat expectations and expectations appear to be low in my opinion. Tough to tell for sure though, markets are fickle things.

4755 2018-11-30 03:26:33 If any changes in macros(from crude oil price to int.rates) will impact on your business in long-run then seriously react to such changes, but most of the time these changes are temporarily affect on prices of the stocks & not the value of underlying business.

4759 2018-11-30 03:24:41 @rick_n @IngrahamAngle @washingtonpost Rick, so the Euro trash feels that red Christmas trees are a bad sign. A real bad sign here in the U.S. is when the mainstream media is so contaminated with TDS Trump Derangement Syndrome that they're laughing stocks with ZERO credibility.

4764 2018-11-30 03:21:18 I believe in dividend growth stocks and dividend reinvestment plans. 

I have pretty good empirical data they’re a healthy and efficient way to create retirement financial security. You should investigate them too.

You’re welcome.
4765 2018-11-30 03:19:35 Oo nga SM Ent, re-stock niyo na lang yung lightstick please. Hustisya sa mga baby EXO-Ls like me na hindi na naabutan yung stocks niyo huhu
4766 2018-11-30 03:19:32 That’s insane! I didn’t even know it was that high. I only trade weed stocks...dispensary is another level tho! Proper research and funds and we could do this thing for real.

4769 2018-11-30 03:18:06 10 yr yield responds most to inflation expectations. If growth peaked and slows and inflation slows stocks will not keep going up. Very likely stocks peaked for the cycle.
4770 2018-11-30 03:18:04 Hi, does this indicator works for stocks too? Or only futures? I tired to open the video link but it did not work? Do we need to be a member to view this?
4771 2018-11-30 03:15:26 Most under appreciated trait of a financial adviser is to say NO to stocks where there is black box of garbage waiting to explode. Sometimes, explosion takes years, sometimes explosion happens after three digit returns. But invariably it always happens.
4772 2018-11-30 03:15:13 .@_nirajshah Interesting take on pack of filtered-five High Div Yield Stocks, and it shows in their valuation! Except for #BSE, the #PSU Tag in other 4 is a major concern. Higher Dividend payout, at least in case of ONGC, HPCL & PTC, given their Debt, is a big ? .@BloombergQuint
4773 2018-11-30 03:14:32 Trading stocks is like being a POW...torture day in & day out knowing help is on the way & then it’s vengeance & every MoFo bear is dying.

4781 2018-11-30 03:13:02 I'm asking you to justify the need for having bump stocks? It's an epistemological approach in making distinctions between beliefs and justified beliefs.
4782 2018-11-30 03:12:45 Yeah, that you’re huge fucking laughing stocks!

4786 2018-11-30 03:09:45 Why? Mr. Soros launched an attack on her company.   A counterattack is inevitable. Especially if the attacker is an investor who makes money by shorting stocks.
4787 2018-11-30 03:09:37 Understand that part. No replacement/substitutes? Even our local @GiantFood increased stocks of other options.

4794 2018-11-30 03:06:07 Bump stocks are lame novelty items.  You can do the same thing with rubber bands, belt strap, or even your finger with practice.  #nothingburger
4795 2018-11-30 03:05:53 An app that gives you stocks for signing up and getting people to sign up and you can cash out on your stocks when you want  hmu for more info
4796 2018-11-30 03:05:38 Yet we’re more concerned about the false reality that our phones and social media are putting us in. Being interested in irrelevant topics like the fucking Kardashians. Just like how in the 1920’s they were only interested in stocks and making money... led to Great Depression
4797 2018-11-30 03:05:24 @realDonaldTrump if you ban bump stocks, will you work to repeal the unconstitutional NFA laws? #repealNFA #everygunlawisaninfringement
4798 2018-11-30 03:04:31 why doesnt maxis have stocks for the ipx....im tired
4799 2018-11-30 03:04:21 Actually 0 chance of Bitcoin going to zero and 99.9% chance of Bitcoin going to $15 million+ per bitcoin in today's dollars. Total replacement of Fiat, All debt, portion of stocks and real estate. will happen between 15-30 years.
4800 2018-11-30 03:04:21 U.S. Market Check
U.S. stocks fell for the first time in four days as fresh trade anxiety outweighed a dovish shift by the Fed ahead of a highly anticipated sit-down between the U.S. and China.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries was flat at 3.03 percent.
4801 2018-11-30 03:02:16 No, no, no. He's probably right, it is the economy. The regular worker is investing/spending millions of dollars in stocks.
4802 2018-11-30 03:02:05 Every one buy these stocks it is expected to raise more today. Intraday traders can also take their call as buy as moving averages are highly favourable towards buy. Resistance is also breaking.
4803 2018-11-30 03:02:04 @MarketSmithIND , It would be great if you add @markminervini mark minervini trend template also in your filter or Add at-least EMA, MA filter in your filter, So that we can get stocks those are in stage 2 + have sound fundamental....
4804 2018-11-30 03:00:23 The stock market is not factoring a BJP loss in MP and/or Chattisgarh. BJP loss in Rajasthan is anticipated.
This might give opportunities to investors who missed the recent correction to buy good stocks.
The stock market may have a knee-jerk correction.
4805 2018-11-30 03:00:05 So you don't need bump stocks.

Why do you want to keep them?

4807 2018-11-30 02:58:40 I think the reason why Buffet said that is because he invests in stocks. He doesn't want people to shift their money to cryptos. Because that way, stock investors will become less.
4808 2018-11-30 02:58:38 CMIIW ya kak, basic-nya pasar modal memang bonds & stocks. Jadi hal 2 ini memang basic banget untuk dipelajari. Kalau 2 ini sudah paham luar dalam, kalau mau investasi ke yang lain silakan aja.
4809 2018-11-30 02:58:24 Things you shouldn't invest in until you have decent job or fulfilled your academic ambition

1.Stocks

4812 2018-11-30 02:54:57 What is the reason for all FANG and related stocks to sell off 20% but TSLA goes nowhere?
4813 2018-11-30 02:54:42 It’s still in thousand level. 

While the average stocks is in 2 digit and 3 digits dollar value.
4814 2018-11-30 02:54:12 It’s not about the bump stocks, anybody with half a brain can bump fire any semi-auto that has recoil. People are so stupid, all this is gonna be is a step towards banning semiautomatic weapons.

4816 2018-11-30 02:52:44 From personal experience, all ledges on sharkable platforms are like Smash 4 Lylat x 100. I just had a match where all 6 stocks where SDs due to ledge stuff on Brinstar. Skyloft is a little better but still bad (SD about 1nce every 5-10 stocks). Frigate is not as bad but still.
4817 2018-11-30 02:52:14 Sir please let me know 3 stocks please
4818 2018-11-30 02:52:10 What’s the real issue? Companies do this all the time. Sheryl Sandburg wanted to know if George Soros was shorting Facebook stocks. The debacle was that they hired the wrong firm for that research. 

Proceed with caution when using conservative firms (Cambridge Analytica??)

4824 2018-11-30 02:48:12 Seems like a typical J White move ie straight from his playbook. He drops the story (leak) to the media to increase his stocks.
4825 2018-11-30 02:47:57 Yeah, bump stocks should have never been allowed and multi round magazines either. They are harmful to the weapons too. It's just the thrill of the moment that enthusiast like but not long.
And there are lots of of us that agree. But shoving it down our throats is not the way.

4835 2018-11-30 02:41:02 Well looks like they ( the government) are doing something, with the bump stocks, it’s a start . But people who want guns should have guns
4836 2018-11-30 02:40:07 Yeah, this is a tough one to actually enforce, I would think. However, there is only one company (I think) that makes bump stocks. But getting access to their sales records would present a massive privacy problem.

4846 2018-11-30 02:31:14 After reading up I found that the Las Vegas shooter did have bump stocks. If he did use bump stocks, it probably saved some lives. Firing with bump stocks makes the shooter notoriously inaccurate. Still if this was the only mass shooting using these, my statement still stands.

4852 2018-11-30 02:27:00 "Investing in stocks is not like putting your money in a savings account that pays 10 percent annually. Returns will fluctuate from year to year, sometimes dramatically. The 10 percent is only an average of some bang-up years, and some gut-wrenching years."-Christopher Browne.

4887 2018-11-30 02:12:59 Well good. That's their job.

Supermarket Guy Stocks the Olive Aisle at Aldi.  See? It's easy to write headlines like that
4888 2018-11-30 02:11:57 @mattjcan is threatened by Young people. And is simply trying to protect his private investments. 
BTW How are your stocks doing in Mining Companies, Matt??

Theres no room for stale grumpy old barstards in Parliament.Time for passionate and enthusiastic Young people to take over

THANK YOU MAM !
4890 2018-11-30 02:11:04 I was told that skechers went on sale with the official IDPD cap and shirt. Price was under 1k and it sold out with one refresh  Contact wasn't able to order any. Waaah I'm so sorry to the buyers of the said items!!! 

Skechers might be trying to clear stocks before S2! ><
4891 2018-11-30 02:10:44 Amen.  Anyone who changes fromTrump to a Dem over bump stocks wasn't part of his "base" to begin with.
4892 2018-11-30 02:10:17 Llamá igual a los laboratorios para rastrear el emdicamento.. mucha gente consigue asi los stocks. 
4893 2018-11-30 02:09:47 2% drop in GDP, leading to a 6% rise in Unemployment, 12% rise in Bank Defaults, 24% crash in Stocks.. For a grossly leveraged, externally oriented economy having few friends, the doomsday cycle to disrupt its challenge to US hegemony, has just begun..
4894 2018-11-30 02:09:46 What happens to anyone who doesn't surrender or destroy their bump stocks?
4895 2018-11-30 02:09:44 Well... there go my stocks - we'll have a mental deficient lunatic running the financial show. Who in the hell thought that was a good idea!
4896 2018-11-30 02:07:39 That would have been a pretty nice paycheck to use and play with more stocks! Even thought I wasn’t able to get in I encouraged others to get in while it was at 5.80!
4897 2018-11-30 02:07:16 HSBC on IT
2018 good year for IT stocks, helped by better demand & INR weakness
Demand looks even better in 2019, albeit INR tailwind may be missing this year
Election may have a significant impact on relative vals in 2019
Like Infosys the most in large-cap IT

4898 2018-11-30 02:06:43 That’s it? Trade proper stocks with @trickmitch1 and that’s damn near a scalp with the best strategies in the game! With all due respect, never mind these stress-monger whipsawing mind fk stocks!
4899 2018-11-30 02:06:35 Just like religion and politics, when will be build an impenetrable wall between money and politics. Lobbying is legalized bribery. Representatives trading stocks is insider trading. Any income beyond a politician's salary while in office a conflict of interest.
4900 2018-11-30 02:06:31 $FB continues to grow for two days in a row in after-market trading. To me, it shows that investor sentiment towards #Facebook is starting to recover. We will see if it keeps up... #investing #stocks $Nasdaq $FANG

4905 2018-11-30 02:04:08 A DISASTER for America! He is a hopelessly compromised president.  Corrupt to the core. Our allies hate us. N. Korea is still developing bombs. A science and climate denier. We’re no longer respected around the world.  We’re laughing stocks. He’s in cahoots with RUSSIA. A liar
4906 2018-11-30 02:03:18 European stocks mostly rose on Thursday in the wake of dovish comments from the US Federal Reserve chief.

4909 2018-11-30 02:02:34 Obama gave them a large bail out and now there need more. This is a political move that has hurt the employees more. There stocks took a tumble after they announce the closure. The CEO is at fault on this. Employees blame the CEO
4910 2018-11-30 02:02:19 US stocks fell on Thursday, as nerves over tariffs and trade policy weighed on sentiment ahead of the G20 summit and a Saturday meeting of the Chinese and American presidents
4911 2018-11-30 02:01:13 but same would apply to most Nov 30 options on stocks and indices, no?

4917 2018-11-30 01:57:02 So you're not going to ban and confiscate it like you're doing with bump stocks?
4918 2018-11-30 01:56:35 Well, it's really pretty sick that folks like you must have toys like bump stocks.  WTF.
4919 2018-11-30 01:56:29 He's not and we're not and your son will never be allowed to buy or sell stocks again.  How does that feel?

4927 2018-11-30 01:49:36 ICYMI: Trump said his admin will be formally banning bump stocks in the coming days. This will prohibit the sale of bump stocks and possibly other fire-rate modifications for firearms.

4931 2018-11-30 01:47:05 Hope none of you plan on turning in your bump stocks. The ATF isn't going to pass up the opportunity to get names and IDs of the everyone who turns it in. Because if you had one you have an "assault rifle" and they want to know for future confiscation events.
4932 2018-11-30 01:46:22 People still talk about stocks?
4933 2018-11-30 01:44:52 Can I ask you something? Why don’t politicians divest from stocks and put money in a blind trust? Didn’t they used to?
4934 2018-11-30 01:44:21 Twitter doesn't have 'executives'. They are all brainwashed internationalists who think they are above the Free Speech laws. They influence the US elections by blocking Republicans. Many more should chain themselves to the HQ and watch the @Twitter stocks drop like rocks!

4941 2018-11-30 01:38:44 @Mike001 $ABC re: Cannabis stocks. It appears to me these stocks got way overshot. See as very high risk. Too many better stocks to trade.
4942 2018-11-30 01:35:44 Unfortunately, WHSmith in Reading no longer stocks NWN so I haven’t seen the piece. I didn’t contact them, that was done by the charity who organised the press releases. I just filled in some details and sent it to them at their request.
4943 2018-11-30 01:30:46 Notice how Trump banned bump stocks after the election. 

If anything is going to make him lose 2020, it is that.
4944 2018-11-30 01:30:27 That’ll boost the Nationals electoral stocks. #auspol #ICAC
4945 2018-11-30 01:30:24 Bump stocks aren’t registered. They are also removable so, awesome that they are illegal but it’s not going to take any guns of the street.
You should have to qualify with your weapon before you can own it and pass a legitimate background test
4946 2018-11-30 01:30:09 ...I have a problem with growth-stock investing. Companies tend not to grow at high rates forever. Businesses change... Markets mature. Competition can increase. Good managements can retire... the market is littered with once highly profitable growth stocks... -- Ed Wachenheim
4947 2018-11-30 01:29:33 Hanes and Fruit-of-the-Loom stocks are likely rising cuz of all the skid marks one large egotistical Argentine visitor is making in his drawers...

4950 2018-11-30 01:28:33 unfortunately t bills, cd's have very low interest rates.  thus they are not the  main source in a 401k.   The main source are mutual funds which rely heavily on stocks.  one can't live on the interest of cd's etc. and dividends are going too.  better to get out of debt. first.
4951 2018-11-30 01:28:29 He's @jackals is doing it on purpose for TWEETER ATTENTION cause stocks are down!!
4952 2018-11-30 01:28:03 Farmers and auto workers are going bankrupt, but Trump is just like the honey badger, he doesn't care. Oh, stocks have taken a beating also.
4953 2018-11-30 01:26:58 Is the dems attempt to ban bump stocks. They’re way to make it look like they give a fuck?

4960 2018-11-30 01:22:24 I tried doing a diverse portfolio for a few months prior to Oct 17. I threw in $HMMJ as a  kind of modifier. Also I had $WMD instead of $OGI, but that’s just me. It definitely helps avoid the big swings of just having 2-3 stocks in play.
4961 2018-11-30 01:20:38 Nah Kristen !! Compering for lesser known stocks 
4962 2018-11-30 01:19:59 So 10 trillion dollars did nothing but 3 trillion did? That's a good one. Next you will tell me that the only ones purchasing stocks after the tax cuts were those low and middle incomes and farmers.

4964 2018-11-30 01:19:45 Quick!  Sell all your stocks and quit your job!  If you don't you, too, are contributing to the problem.  Just starve to death and do it quietly so as not to disturb your neighbors.  When you finally expire be sure not to increase the entropy in the universe.  Thanks.
4965 2018-11-30 01:19:09 Banning bump stocks yet NO Reciprocity.. wtf
4966 2018-11-30 01:18:48 On the bright side today, Imodium stocks are rising significantly.
4967 2018-11-30 01:18:04 @realDonaldTrump I’m am a huge supporter, but if you sign a ban on bump stocks you will lose my vote in 2020 and there are millions of others that feel the same as me. What happened to defending our 2nd Amendment? This is the start of gutting it.

QUICK QUESTION, JIM. Is The Robinhood App a good app to use for online investment in stocks? Help me out.
4985 2018-11-30 01:05:07 You bet, the customer service is great and very responsive, Ophir is also accessable via Twitter. CML has 2 fee services, one for active traders (Trade Machine) and CML Pro which generally covers high growth thematic tech stocks. Updates are sent after earnings and updated as
4986 2018-11-30 01:03:31 No.  His base is almost unanimously anti-Democrat.  Bump stocks are lint in the grand scheme of things.
4987 2018-11-30 01:03:00 yea for sure, interesting day, switched from red to green and back to red, but basically closed flat. Stocks flat, BTC flat. Tomorrow will be big Trump will meet Xi at the G20, some high drama is brewing.

4989 2018-11-30 01:01:43 Main problem I see with Crypto is the people who don't research anything and then expect the orange slice... If you strategically place your Tron like a chess board into projects / stocks. You can create a huge pot of TRX... But they want the cake and eat to it also.
4990 2018-11-30 01:01:32 I would assume that while many of us watch our stocks “like kids,” for kids you really can’t have favs, but for stocks, everybody has their favorite “kid” in their portfolio. Gotta admit, $DIS is my favorite. It’s my largest position. It’s my SWAN stock.
4991 2018-11-30 01:01:12 BIEN

4994 2018-11-30 00:59:50 I hope this doesn't happen... but lowkey i feel like ppl are gonna argue about having 4 stocks instead of 3 because more than 10 characters can take early stocks. SHOCKING.
4995 2018-11-30 00:59:30 @VersoBooks saw #RevoltingProstitutes in @Hodges_Figgis but they appear to have run out.  You might want to check that they keep their stocks up to meet demand
4996 2018-11-30 00:58:12 I honestly think bump stocks are dumb. Just ruins the rifle.
4997 2018-11-30 00:57:55 ...

I think Bumper Stocks are SPEW-PID and a waste of ammo.

But,

If they can ban Bumper-stocks, they can (and will) ban ANYTHING!!!

5000 2018-11-30 00:56:26 GM repaid their previous bail-out. Unfortunately, big tariffs on steel + raw materials have caused company to crash (pardon the pun). They recently received huge tax breaks + wasted it on stocks buy-backs instead of balancing the books + concentrating cash on their core business.

5004 2018-11-30 00:53:10 @realDonaldTrump sir. I know you are a busy person. But please sir, tell us what you think about the Bitcoin . Very thankful. 

Fake news says you doing bad but i only see America growing again. Stocks are great, jobs are excellent. Borders are secured! Best USA president ever?
5005 2018-11-30 00:51:56 It's interesting that he points to Microsoft surpassing Apple, but Microsoft has also been buying back a lot of stock (and Disney, that he points as a potential target, was also buying back a lot before FOX). - Good companies also buy back stocks. ;)
5006 2018-11-30 00:51:52 Gold and palladium bars. Have to boost my net worth and also, more stocks, and going to get into the flipping houses business
5007 2018-11-30 00:50:58 It’s all about Trump watching tv....NRA losing a ton of money, Trump thinks they are done, no more money heading to him....let’s ban bump stocks! Yeah!
5008 2018-11-30 00:49:13 Eric Nuttall, senior portfolio manager with Ninepoint Partners, who invests in Canadian oil and gas stocks, said “it’s not  surprising” that other fund managers are coming forward with their  concerns.

Such hypocrites. Smh
5014 2018-11-30 00:47:18 My favorite Smash 4 memory was the Low Tier Crew Battle where I took a ton of stocks with Dedede. Really made me feel myself as a player, and to see that people were excited about my play also made me really happy. Team @captainbronze forever.
5015 2018-11-30 00:46:32 It's the $ASX man. Big boys decide when and how it's gonna be wrecked. Too many nervous people buying with tight stops across the board, all it takes is a little dump on the big stocks and it all unravels again and drags the entire market down with it through index fear.
5016 2018-11-30 00:46:28 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your ADHD
5017 2018-11-30 00:45:31 Like this one too Schoeman. Pick of the UK prop stocks imo. Could certainly drop further, but good long term value methinks.
5018 2018-11-30 00:44:41 Not just advantage but unless your character has great onstage tools for harassing offstage opponents its gonna be somewhat advised to not chase this character offstage until the meta develops a bit otherwise its free stocks for the pupper.
5019 2018-11-30 00:44:00 He showed the potential of bump stocks to be used in terrorist acts. I guess the government didn't like that.
5020 2018-11-30 00:43:55 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, DO NOT SIGN ANY BILL THAT BANS BUMP STOCKS!!! Do not sign any bill that does not fund the wall, either.
5021 2018-11-30 00:43:39 stocks rise by 1%.
5022 2018-11-30 00:43:38 You and your friends have massive stocks in big pharma.  The American people will never get the healthcare they need.  Republicans will make absolutely sure of it.

5024 2018-11-30 00:42:11 We made an 8 team tournament work at stocks every Tuesday for beer pong, I think these guys can figure it out.
5025 2018-11-30 00:42:09 These 2 Tech Stocks Look Compelling After Their Big Pullbacks
5026 2018-11-30 00:42:03 For the #G20Summit , i’ll trade the sandwich style. Choose your stocks. 2 OTM options small position. 1 Puts, 1 Calls. As i expect a volatile Monday. Good news or bad news...i would be VERY surprised if the result of this #XiTrump meeting end with a neutral opinion. #WeeklyCharts
5027 2018-11-30 00:41:33 Niggas get a pair of air pods and suddenly act like they rey sell you some stocks and bonds
5028 2018-11-30 00:40:08 CML still holding above the stop of R44 but they have certainly been buying the kind of stocks that tempt the devil.
5029 2018-11-30 00:40:04 I imagine there are quite a few bump stocks floating around. Curious how they will be found and confiscated.
Have you perfected the Pre-Cog system used in MINORITY REPORT? If not, I guess I won't be able to tell you a number.
5030 2018-11-30 00:40:02 what is a "gap fill" in crypto? crypto markets are 24/7 so theres no deviation in close/open price causing a gap (like in stocks)
5031 2018-11-30 00:38:24 Basically a slow hyperweight with the ability to stocks in 2-3 interactions.
But with 2 kill throws, a combo throw, a frame 3 counter, and a high priority move that beats projectiles.
5032 2018-11-30 00:38:14 Please talk about value/mom combo. I know you can’t talk about your fund specifically but why have value stocks with strong momentum significantly underperformed separate value and momentum portfolios.
5033 2018-11-30 00:35:43 Greatly appreciate your input. Thank you. How is there customer service? And generally, how many stocks does he cover for his subscription? Without a free trial, just trying to get a gauge of the service. How often do you get updates? Again, thank you.
5034 2018-11-30 00:35:40 Possibly a overseas bank account number. 6x is a margin for Foreign accounts not traceable by the IRS. That means any stocks worth more than 10k can be deposited & held in the account without touching hands, straight profit. So basically money laundering!!
5035 2018-11-30 00:34:47 @realDonaldTrump Issue new common stocks to pay down the debts, dilution! ATT stock is going down below $10. Bad "GE business model" to follow.

5043 2018-11-30 00:31:10 I respect that. Let me rephrase my question. What stocks in Mj do you love... say top two. What 1-2 do you hate?

5046 2018-11-30 00:29:49 Just because it sounds like automatic, doesn't mean it is. I think bump stocks are ridiculous and would never get one, however it is still not an automatic weapon
5047 2018-11-30 00:29:34 No comprehension of how money works. Owning stocks is a bet on success of business. That business also pays workers. Only profits are added to stock owners; pension funds COUNT in that figure. The $ is not in a bank account - the capital enables the functioning of the economy!!!
5048 2018-11-30 00:29:24 Omg @russellcrowe I watched that movie last night in bed. I love that song. But seeing you guys in those stocks does not look comfortable.

5050 2018-11-30 00:28:54 Give me your soon to be illegal bump stocks 
5051 2018-11-30 00:28:52 Shit, I don’t know stocks. Does this mean we buy Deutsche? Or short it?
5052 2018-11-30 00:28:50 That means stocks rally from here if this is true...
5053 2018-11-30 00:28:31 I love poking at XRP troll. I've been doing this since I was on AOL with crap stocks. The dummies never listen they just dig in their heels and lose all their money. I have seen this maybe with 100+ securities/investments. It never changes. Always have the same reaction.
5054 2018-11-30 00:25:42 I think these stocks could turn out to be an epic investment. The current valuations are very high. As Ross says, a long-term high risk play - not for everyone but maybe a good option for investors with a long term horizon and high risk tolerance.

5060 2018-11-30 00:19:52 It’s takes a special kind of person to day trade stocks. I’m glad God made me one of those special ones .. I’ve met some awesome traders. Real talk. Gets better everyday!  #ThankfulThursday #ThursdayThoughts
5061 2018-11-30 00:19:33 A large part of it will be stage talk and rule sets. What stocks/time we want, what to look for on the day 1 patch (See: Will Lylat be fixed), etc. I'd love to have your input on it.
5062 2018-11-30 00:19:18 You're technically correct, but in this case if he did use the bump stocks, it probably saved some lives. Firing with bump stocks makes the shooter notoriously inaccurate. Still if this was the only mass shooting using these, my statement still stands.
5063 2018-11-30 00:18:18 Eventually top #potstocks will be defensive stocks. There I said it. $NSRGY started small at some point too.
5064 2018-11-30 00:17:14 I’m restarting my New Highs and New Lows thread with a couple of constraints

1) Stocks only
2) USA 

Since my primary trading is US based stocks. I think (and got some good feedback recently)this is a cleaner way to look at breadth.
5065 2018-11-30 00:16:54 @POTUS the only thing banning bump stocks will do is to let half of your supporters that your pissing on them
5066 2018-11-30 00:15:57 But guys, this is *strategic* rezoning. It’s not nearly as volatile as stocks or bonds. 
5067 2018-11-30 00:15:27 To my friends who kept asking about Erich Fromm's The Art of Loving, BBW's last two stocks was displayed earlier.
5068 2018-11-30 00:14:56 ... yea I saw it when he posted them on IG ... hard af but he prolly should’ve bought some stocks instead #WordsOfMohanWisdom
5069 2018-11-30 00:13:58 Did they really suggest changing stock brokers (I didn't give them a click)? Who in our generation has stocks?

5074 2018-11-30 00:11:43 Give me death taxes, and capital gains taxes. Money needs to get moving again, and it isn't happening sitting in stocks.
5075 2018-11-30 00:09:03 Holy shit, your gun laws are even more broken than I thought.

Okay, I will amend my statement.

For NO background check, bump stocks allowed you to pretend that you were only buying a semi-auto weapon.

Now, if you want fully automatic, you have to jump through all the hoops.
5076 2018-11-30 00:08:01 Best Trading Vehicle has been CAD futures cause low Margins and good tick values. This comes from experience and you will also find the way you like to Trade. just make sure you have full access to Stocks/Bonds Commodities and Forex. each one requires you sign a form.
5077 2018-11-30 00:08:00 Asia stocks begin lacklustre following a similar performance on Wall St with participants tentative ahead of the Trump-Xi showdown at the G20, while China hawk Navarro back on the dinner guest list; ASX 200 (-0.7%), Nikkei 225 (-0.1%), KOSPI (+0.1%)

Discussions?
5079 2018-11-30 00:06:30 I was so agree I had a hard time sleeping last night. I told friends trump was a liar and a conman when I once owned Trump stocks seeing him take all the money out for himself leaving us with nothing.
5080 2018-11-30 00:06:12 Bring back the stocks and make use of that mouldy fruit. The little shite won’t do that again I bet.
5081 2018-11-30 00:04:05 But how many bump stocks were sold? I bet lots! #tytlive
5082 2018-11-30 00:04:04 Jwb pertanyaan sy dl aja yg barusan. Sdh prnh handle stock options blm? At least prnh belajar mengerti mekanisme stocks. Beda long term n short term options. Basic stuff. Answer this first then i shall see if it is worth my time answering u.
5083 2018-11-30 00:03:34 Hmm @ali   Maybe this is the route to take.. affect the stocks
5084 2018-11-30 00:03:12 Do you remember your first client and how you got them? I'll share, I got my first client at the laundry mat, when I was talking to a friend about investing in stocks and how to build a strong portfolio
5085 2018-11-30 00:02:11 Bump stocks are very unnecessary
5086 2018-11-30 00:01:52 @mharrington5650 thanks Bro...I’m tempted to cut losses and buy into a few surging EFT’s and rebounding Tech stocks but I hate bears!
