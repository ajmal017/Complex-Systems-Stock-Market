41 2018-03-15 21:11:10 Well, that's good in theory. But the reality is that nobody cares about Brave around me. Not even about Firefox. People don't really choose privacy over commodities. As long as they get used to something and it works, that's better for them, so...they won't leave Chrome.
42 2018-03-15 21:10:59 I will also always argue how it’s a key player as to why the sex trafficking industry continues to flourish. Using people as commodities for commercialized sex.
43 2018-03-15 21:02:13 Como todo depende... En las commodities para mi es obvio q tarde o temprano habrá esa recuperación. En mi humilde opinión, en el retail con ecomerce habrá ganadores y perdedores (ahi si q hay q hilar fino)
44 2018-03-15 21:00:57 La suba de febrero 2018 de los precios mayoristas (IPIM) es aún más preocupante que la del IPC (core). El IPIM trepó casi 5 % en febrero y roza 10% en el 1er bimestre, lo que significa mayor presión de costos. Dólar, Electricidad y commodities (agro+petróleo) impulsaron el alza.

49 2018-03-15 20:20:24 I love that #commodities typically exhibit positive skewness whereas stocks exhibit negative skewness.  For instance, if a corn crop goes bad corn futures shoot up.  If something bad happens to stocks, prices fall off a cliff.  #BCOM #Agricultural
50 2018-03-15 20:16:08 Given that commodites have negative (and statistically significant) correlations to bonds, it seems like a no brainer for fixed income heavy portfolios to start allocating to #commodities.  Remember, commodities are a better hedge to inflation than #stocks and #bonds!
51 2018-03-15 20:15:27 Over time, my hunch is that we’ll see plenty of tokens qualifying as commodities if they are sold and marketing to consumers as such.  Selling tokens directly to “investors" is legally risky and there really isn’t a compelling policy reason to permit such activity.

55 2018-03-15 19:47:48 The problem is that it was driven by a desire to make immigrants commodities at the service of the British people. All about being 'useful little engines' and if you are not 'out with you!'.... That is worse than not wanting immigrants around, it is subservience and dehumanising.

138 2018-03-15 14:38:41 That’s why TA works best with commodities. The underlying fundamentals don’t change that often. But it can still happen (say if a freak event wipes out 25% of a crop). This basic tenant of analysis (applies to TA, Quant, FA) is forgotten by most TA crypto twitter

150 2018-03-15 14:09:18 As stated by Goldman Sachs CEO, the concept of intrinsic value is flawed, and base value in assets simply doesn't exist. For instance, stocks,commodities, and fiat currencies also do not have intrinsic value, as their value solely depend on the supply and demand by a free market.
151 2018-03-15 14:08:08 Bride trafficking is also commonly called bride buying- a strange term because despite their sale, these 'brides' are no commodities. These are real women who happen to be victims of bride #trafficking . How can anyone truly buy another human being?

166 2018-03-15 12:56:33 I've been saying lately that the money based system like ours provides a decent amount of flexibility and decentralization in how commodities are produced and distributed.

174 2018-03-15 12:46:29 Broadly, yes. Note that gold has limited industrial use and is less vulnerable to an economic slowdown than other commodities. Also, unlike cash, it cannot be demonetized or devalued. Finally, it is not anyone's obligation and cannot default, unlike bonds.

180 2018-03-15 12:20:28 Actually we do have a $17 billion defict when/if you include energy & timber ex-Canada. But then who knows what other commodities Govt might be conveniently excluding from defict so the figures justify globalism.
181 2018-03-15 12:18:00 During commodities boom they sensibly built reserves from $1.76b to $15.1b. Unfortunately, since 2015 they have run large deficits, & seem unwilling to adapt spending to the reality of lower commodities prices. If they don't adapt soon Bolivia could sadly become another Venezuela
182 2018-03-15 12:06:38 cost of living computation is very complex, our society has many strata of living, consumption pattern very much varying, prices of commodities highly flexible-still this can be accepted in comparison to other Global cities.

232 2018-03-15 06:13:10 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.
233 2018-03-15 05:33:53 Commodities are in an uptrend
234 2018-03-15 05:29:15 Transitioning from selling your time to selling value can be daunting. The first step is to realize money is a commodity that comes from a myriad of money-vending machines called investors. Develop your skills so you can transform commodities into something of actual value.

236 2018-03-15 05:18:16 Thank God my boys love to save commodities & leave them at my houseEven tho, I seriously hate it They be like “Mama where’s that such & such I had saved in case we needed itI be wanting to say in the trash Well, I found some jelly in the fridge.
237 2018-03-15 05:16:33 probably because animals/pets are commodities to pretty much everyone? granted, commodities they get very attached too. but still.
238 2018-03-15 05:00:01 Commodities: Rubber +5.70%, Rice +2.59%
239 2018-03-15 04:46:26 illegally acquiring military grade firearms is not like buying drugs or mundane illegal commodities. much more expensive and difficult to acquire. equating alcohol prohibition to assault weapon regulation is an analogy full of flaws and inconsistencies
240 2018-03-15 04:34:52 Not poo pooing but where is the evidence that Japan was signaling surrender through state channels? It looks like they were fighting to the end even though commodities of war were thin.

242 2018-03-15 04:29:55 Your the only person talking sense in this space atm, but do you really think it will stay at 1k, even when compared to commodities, such as gold? Maybe once the euro starts showing its cracks and more banks in Italy start falling we will remember the importance of btc.
243 2018-03-15 04:24:11 If you are trading using technical analysis then you can trade commodities right away. The lots are also cheaper then stock FNO.
244 2018-03-15 04:22:48 So you dont know about commodities market? It goes on till midnight.
245 2018-03-15 04:20:39 no discussion. Thus he has not per se hurt the middle class. If you see the inflation rate is lower & price of commodities is less. Food is cheaper & rise in prices checked. Anger is more about the govt peeking into the common man's wallet 
Demonetization was as per me meant to
246 2018-03-15 04:17:23 I'm def still amazed by jeepney drivers who, inspite of the increase in prices of diff commodities, still charge me for P6 instead of P7 for a distance that I could walk for less than 30 mins (but chose not to)
247 2018-03-15 04:15:39 That's not how commodities work.
248 2018-03-15 04:11:11 And there followed them successors who inherited the Scripture [while] taking the commodities of this lower life and saying, "It will be forgiven for us." And if an offer like it comes to them, they will [again] take it.
249 2018-03-15 04:10:32 also my girl does commodities trading in india, and i wanna work on adding web tech to make it easier to facilitate drop off of crops for the farmers
250 2018-03-15 03:49:31 It's not made up by anyone. Demand and supply, like all commodities and currencies.
251 2018-03-15 03:39:56 Part 17 Congress should back our money with gold, silver, other commodities, federal government owned lands. IMF The Realities of Modern Hyperinflation PDF. Roman empire destroyed value of its money over time
252 2018-03-15 03:39:52 Onde está o partido ou presidenciável propondo menor dependência das exportações de commodities? O Brasil atualmente forma profissionais e os exporta para outros países, já que aqui não estão as melhores oportunidades, isso para um país com 207 milhões de pessoas. Utopia.
253 2018-03-15 03:30:41 El segundo gobierno de AG fue bueno, no solo por los precios de los commodities, también por tener Ministros de Economía y Finanzas que manejaron adecuadamente esa Cartera. Recuerden quienes fueron sus Ministros.

256 2018-03-15 02:46:14 Pets are not family. Dont be stupid. Animals shouldn't be treated as if they are human, but as a species unto themselves deserving respect. They don't belong in passenger compartments unless they are essential (to the blind, e.g.). Otherwise they are simply emotional commodities.
257 2018-03-15 02:38:03 Also the federal government sets the price for commodities with the loan rate. Government support or subsidies are for the consumer not the producer. You couldn’t afford to eat or put clothes on with out them.

259 2018-03-15 02:28:14 You would also want to exclude very specific raw materials and commodities from the Border Tariff.
260 2018-03-15 02:23:47 Every day the idea of following in Thoereau's footsteps and living alone in a cabin somewhere in the woods with no modern commodities sounds better and better
261 2018-03-15 02:19:08 Ahora también los precios de los commodities están en alza y nada. Alan tuvo un excelente Ministro de Economía, el Puma Carranza.
262 2018-03-15 02:15:53 Human capital is one of our most precious commodities. #BSG
263 2018-03-15 02:08:19 I feel for farmers in Brazil but we have the rail in place for the very reason of transporting Canada's commodities be that grain, oil or other I do not see a reason to move backwards when we have a system in place that works as long as they are forced into accountability.
264 2018-03-15 02:04:04 Crypto doesn't behave like currencies they behave like commodities.
When one goes down all go down.

And yeah I guess it's because of the limited fiat gateways.
265 2018-03-15 01:51:38 I wouldn’t read to much into the Tannehill structure. That shouldn’t stop the #Dolphins from taking a quarterback if one falls to #11. QB’s are hot commodities, if he plays well next season, Miami can easily trade him to a QB needy franchise and move forward with the rookie.
266 2018-03-15 01:50:30 It’s almost like I shouldn’t even bother clicking on the Instagram explore’s page. I’m in a damn relationship & don’t see any kind of respect for it—lust and single relationship statuses are the hottest commodities to market. It’s simply just not what’s best for me. LOWKEY.
267 2018-03-15 01:45:33 Darling, seems, that you know nothing about trade and trade practices between your Country and others! US Products like Food, Clothes, Cars, Weapons, Cosmetics, Commodities, High Tech, Meat and many others are without tariffs. Shall the EU, Asia and Russia call tariffs on them?
268 2018-03-15 01:40:07 Darling before had a real house with showers and all the commodities that a normal house has. They weren´t rich but also not extremely poor like now. She remembers all the things that they had but gives special attention to a mattress they had before and the one they had now.
269 2018-03-15 01:35:40 @MichelTemer aproveite para fortalecer as indústrias de bens de consumo e tirar o Brasil desta dependência de exportações de commodities.
270 2018-03-15 01:28:23 Siempre commodities. Sería un logro que aparecieran entre las principales, exportaciones con valor agregado. Pura propaganda.
271 2018-03-15 01:27:26 É que nem comprar uma commodities ... Vc não sabe nada de petróleo ,mas pode comprar um contrato futuro de petróleo . 
Petróleo nao é uma empresa, não produz riqueza . Ele é a própria riqueza , ele é a própria reserva de valor, ele pode ser o próprio meio de troca . Enfim, é só
272 2018-03-15 01:23:26 Bruce, embora controverso o tema , criptomoedas são mais que meios de troca , são mais que reserva de valor ,são mais que modismo . São uma nova tecnologia de armazenamento e notação de dados num mundo digital . É pura , pura criptografia . Não são “empresas”, são commodities
273 2018-03-15 01:22:02 It is amazing what they are doing and they have my total respect and admiration. My issue with the rail is that Canada relies on being able to export our commodities (not just grain) and the railroads need to be able to move goods and meet deadlines for our economy to succeed.

276 2018-03-15 00:59:58 Hey!!!  you’re talking to a Norwegian here.

Commodities are 30% of our GDP
277 2018-03-15 00:50:16 Yeah! why don't our commodities keep up with inflation?  Or maybe just the middle men make that money.
278 2018-03-15 00:48:22 @MariaBartiromo you have to admit if you've studied the lowest common denominator in regards to the most valuable commodities that Amazon relies on and there happens to be much needed change in retail leadership the opportunity to compete is there #havetoadmit
279 2018-03-15 00:44:30 Forget the stupid carbon tax.  It is nothing compared to trains not moving wheat, commodities and oil being blocked east end West.
280 2018-03-15 00:36:51 you... don't actually know how much any of those things cost, do you? Or that you can get a lot of these commodities used/refurbished for relatively cheap?
281 2018-03-15 00:27:28 1) lack of taxation-dependent revenue severs an important link between civilians and state that holds government actors accountable (rentier state) leading to political suppression
2) commodities like oil are highly vulnerable to price shocks (like what happened recently)...

283 2018-03-15 00:19:56 She was a sex trafficker, a pimp and a thief who took advantage of and ruined the lives of the young women she was supposed to be training and mentoring. They trusted her and looked up to her and she sold them like commodities. This shouldn’t just bother wrestling fans
284 2018-03-15 00:00:01 IANAL, but waivers are not protection ;)
I've been thru at least 3 real bear markets in equities and commodities.
What happens in crypto now is nowhere even close to a real bear market.
